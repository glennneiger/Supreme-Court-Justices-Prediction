mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
federal
tort
claims
act
contains
no
affirmative
indication
that
congress
intended
it
to
have
extraterritorial
application.
to
the
contrary,
congress
specified
that
the
united
states
is
not
liable
for
any
claim
arising
in
a
foreign
country.
as
this
court
stated
in
spelar,
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality
is
doubly
fortified
by
the
foreign
country
exception.
either
together
or
separately,
the
foreign
country
exception
and
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
the
united
states
has
not
waived
sovereign
immunity
for
torts
arising
in
antarctica.
let
me
turn
first
to
the
ftca
and
the
foreign
country
exception.
there's
no
question
here
that
antarctica
is
foreign.
it
is
also
a
country
under
the
primary
dictionary
definition
since
it's
a...
a
vast
expanse
of
land.
country
also
means
sovereign
nation,
and
we
acknowledge,
as
does
petitioner,
that...
that
the
phrase
can
be
read
either
way.
but
the
phrase
shouldn't
be
read
in
isolation.
it
should
be
read
together
with
the
other
provisions
of
the
ftca.
or
as
the
dissenter
in
the
d.c.
circuit
case
put
it,
it
would
be
perverse
to
give
the
explicit
exclusion
of
foreign
claims
the
consequence
of
expanding
the
act.
and
reading
the
foreign
country
exception
together
with
the
ftca's
choice
of
law
provision
and
the
venue
provision
of
the
act,
seems
to
us
to
lead
clearly
to
the
conclusion
that
petitioner's
suit
is
barred.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i...
i'm
not
sure
we
would
say
outer
space
is
a
foreign
country.
in
a...
in
a
sense,
if
i
may
comment
on
this
right
now--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
think
that...
i
think
that
this
hypothetical
is
useful
in
showing
that
even
putting
the
foreign
country
exception
to
one
side,
the
united
states
would
prevail
here.
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality
would
certainly
apply
in...
in
the
case
you
hypothesize
involving
outer
space.
since
there
is
no
affirmative
indication
in
the
ftca
that
it
is
meant
to
apply
extraterritorially,
that
would
be
enough,
we
think,
to
support
the
conclusion
that
it
does
not
apply
in
outer
space.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right.
every
time,
every
indication
from
congress
is...
is
contrary
to
the
suggestion
that
it
has
extraterritorial
application.
congress
accepted
foreign
countries.
it
accepted
the
high
seas.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
um,
your
honor,
i
think
that...
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
case.
i
think
it's
an
affirmative
indication--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i...
that...
that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
think
that
it's
an
affirmative
indication
of
congress'
intent
that
the
act
does
not
apply
extraterritorially.
it
covers
99
percent
of
the
cases
that
might
arise,
although
perhaps
that
could
change
as
time
goes
by.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
not
exactly,
justice
souter.
it
contains,
in
subsection
(d)
of
2680,
a...
an
exception
for
suits
arising
under
the
suits
in
admiralty
act
or
the
public
vessels
act.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
those
acts
apply--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--on
the
high
seas,
but
they
also
apply
in
navigable
waters,
so
they
include
areas--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that's
right.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--a
case
like
spelar
arising
in
canada,
lets
say,
would
be
much
harder
if
the
foreign
country
exception
weren't
there.
the
foreign
country
exception,
as
i
say,
makes
99
percent
of
the
cases
easy.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the...
it's
the
language
in
1346--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i'm
not
sure
whether
you're--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
was
referring
to
section
1346(b).
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
certainly,
that...
this
court's
understanding
in
cases
like
richards
and
spelar
has...
has
been
that.
the
united
states
would
be
liable
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
i...
i
guess
i've
read
in
accordance
with
to
mean
that
that...
that
is
the
law
that
applies,
and
it--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--and
i...
i
think
it's
quite
clear
under
this
court's
precedent
that
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred
applies.
now
petitioner's
sole
response
to
the
1346(b)
point
is
to...
is
to
act
as
if
it's
merely
a
choice
of
law
question,
and
applying
the
restatement
he
hypothesizes
that
it's
reasonable
to...
to
apply
oregon
law.
but...
but
that,
of
course,
overlooks
the
language
of
the
statute
that
says
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred
applies.
antarctica
doesn't
have
tort
law,
it
doesn't
have
choice
of
law
rules,
so
in
our
view
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred
is...
is
not
being
applied.
if
antarctica
has
had
foreign
law...
had
its
own
law,
rather,
it
would
be
even
more
clear,
i
think,
that
this
claim
would
be
barred
since,
of
course,
any
antarctica
law
would
be
foreign
and
petitioner
concedes
that
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
the
ftca
is
to
avoid
the
application
of
foreign
law.
let
me
mention
the
venue
provision
briefly
too,
if
i
might.
it
provides
for
venue
in
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
it
also
provides
for
venue
where
the
plaintiff
resides.
and
so
venue
would
lie
in
this
particular
case,
although
it
would
not
lie
in
other
cases
like
the
d.c.
circuit
case
in
beattie,
where
the
plaintiffs
were
not
u.s.
citizens.
now
this
would,
in
effect,
reinstate,
rewrite
the
statute
to
say
that
claims
arising
in
a
foreign
country
in
behalf
of
an
alien
are
barred.
but...
but
that
precise
language
was
in
front
of
congress
and
it
struck
out
at
the
justice
department's
request,
the
phrase
in
behalf
of
an
alien
from
the
draft
bill.
so
with
respect
to
antarctica,
petitioner's
position,
in
effect
rewrites
the
bill
in
a
way...
it
rewrites
the
law
to
reinsert
language
that
congress
explicitly
rejected.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i'm...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
that
is
the
provision
that
says
that
the
united
states
is
liable,
quote,
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that
that...
that
it
points
you
to
antarctica,
there
is
no
law
to
apply
there,
therefore
the
united
states
is
not...
has
not
waived
sovereign
immunity
for
torts
arising
in
antarctica.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the
point
i
think
justice
souter
well
made
a
few
minutes
ago.
so
even
without
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality,
we
would
say
that
it's
clear
that
congress
didn't
intend
to
waive
sovereign
immunity
for
torts
arising
in
antarctica.
but...
but
that
longstanding
presumption
resolves
any
doubt,
in
our
view.
in
eeoc
v.
aramco
this
court
recently
reiterated
that
a
statute
does
not
apply
overseas
unless
there
is
evidence
of
an
affirmative
congressional
intent
to
extend
its
provisions
beyond
our
territorial
waters.
for
the
reasons
i've
just
outlined,
not
only
is
there
no
affirmative
intent,
to
the
contrary,
the
opposite
conclusion
should
be
drawn.
the
principle
provision
points
to
antarctica,
in
our
view.
the
venue
provision
would
be
rewritten
to
reinstate
a
result
that
congress
rejected,
under
petitioner's
view.
and,
of
course,
rather
than
suggesting
that
the
act
applies
overseas,
congress
expressly
stated
that
it
does
not
apply
in
a
foreign
country.
i
think
it's
useful
to
compare
this
case
with
eeoc
v.
aramco
and
i'd
like
to
take
a
moment
to
do
that.
in
that
case,
of
course,
this
court
held
that
title
vii
doesn't
apply
overseas.
now,
title
vii
contained
an
alien
exemption
provision
stating
that
title
vii
didn't
apply
to
the
employment
of
aliens
outside
any
state.
this
court
acknowledged
that
by
negative
implication
the
alien
exemption
provision
suggested
that
u.s.
citizens
might
be
covered
overseas,
but
held
that
that
was
not
clear
enough
to
overcome
the
presumption.
moreover,
there
was
nothing
in
title
vii
that
would
have
been
rendered
incoherent
by
a
holding
that
it
applied
overseas.
and
in
our
view,
section
1346(b),
the
provision
directing
courts
to
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred,
would
have
no
meaning.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
say
a
word
about
the
purposes
of
the
foreign
country
exception
in
the
ftca
and
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality.
petitioner
essentially
hangs
her
whole
argument
on
the
fact
that
one
purpose
of
those
rules
is
to
avoid
the
application
of
foreign
law,
but
they
have
other
purposes
as
well.
by
limiting
ftca
claims
to,
quote,
claims
arising
in
this
country,
as
assistant
attorney
general
shea
said
when
he
proposed
the
language
of
the
exception,
congress
solved
various
other
problems.
for
instance,
in
this
case
suppose
that
the
accident
had
occurred
as
the
hikers
approached
the
new
zealand
base
and
had
been
witnessed
by
persons
at
the
base.
deposing
those
witnesses,
subpoenaing
them
for
trial
in
oregon,
wouldn't
be
simple
matters,
as...
as
the
ninth
circuit
recognized
in
the
meredith
case
and
as
the
fourth
circuit
recognized
in
the
burna
case.
as
assistant
attorney
general
shea
put
it,
barring
such
claims...
or
not
barring
such
claims,
rather,
would,
quote,
lead
to
a
great
deal
of
difficulty,
unquote.
in
addition,
petitioner
overlooks
the
general
purpose
of
the
ftca.
it's
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity,
but
it's
subject
to
many
limitations
and
exceptions,
some
of
which
are
broad,
like
the
discretionary
function
exception.
essentially,
before
1946
congress
itself
handled
all
tort
claims
and
congress'
broader
purpose
was
to
get
rid
of
the
cumbersome
tort
claim
procedure,
or
at
least
to
limit
it
sharply
by
waiving
torts...
in
our
view,
waiving
liability
for
torts
committed
in
this
country.
but
petitioner
and
others
injured
overseas,
in
our
view,
are
simply
in
the
position
that
all
plaintiffs
were
before
1946.
the
presumption
against
extraterritoriality,
this
court
said
in
the
foley
brothers
case,
is
premised
on
the
notion
that
congress...
congress'
concern
is
assumed
to
be
domestic.
and,
indeed,
in
that
case
which
involved
application
of
the
8-hour
rule
in
iraq,
this
court
held
that
the
law
did
not
apply
there.
there...
there
was
no
suggestion
or
discussion
in
the
court's
opinion,
on
how
this
might
conflict
in
any
way
with
iraqi
law.
petitioner
also
finds
it
odd
that
she
might
have
a
claim
had
the
accident
occurred
on
the
high
seas
off
the
antarctic
shore.
well,
in
our
view
that
just
shows
that
congress
knows
how
to
waive
immunity.
it
has
done
it
on
the
high
seas
and
it
hasn't
done
it
in
foreign
countries.
line
drawing
problems
are,
of
course,
unavoidable
unless
congress
waives
immunity
altogether
or
not
at
all.
if
a
diplomat
driving
to
ottawa
gets
in
a
traffic
accident,
the
united
states
will
be
liable
under
the
ftca
if
the
accident
occurs
on
this
side
of
the
border,
but
not
on
the
other
side.
petitioner
has
also
suggested
that
it's
unfair
in
some
way
that
the
united
states
has
extended
the
tax
and
the
criminal
laws
to
antarctica,
but
hasn't
waived
sovereign
immunity
for
torts
there.
again,
we
think
this
helps
us.
the
tax
statute
specifically
mentions
antarctica
and
the
criminal
law
statute
is
phrased
to
make
clear
that
it
applies
in
all
areas
without
a
sovereign.
congress
knows
how
to
cover
antarctica,
it's
done
it
in
other
statutes,
it
hasn't
done
it
here.
in
sum,
petitioner
is
seeking
this
court...
asking
this
court
to
infer
an
extraterritorial
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
there
is
no
presumption
in
favor
of
such
waivers.
in
fact,
they're
doubly...
the
presumptions
doubly
run
the
other
way.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
if
either
the
victim
or
the
criminal
is
an
american
citizen
under
18
u.s.c.
677--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--it's
covered.
we
don't
think
that
there's
any
basis
to
infer--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--your
honor,
the...
i
suppose--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--there's
a
general
waiver
of
tort
immunity
under
circumstances
where
the
united
states,
if
a
private
person,
would
be
liable
to
the
claimant
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
a
private
person
would
not
be
liable
to
the
claimant
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred
because
there's
no
law
in
antarctica
to
make
that
person
liable.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thus,
in
our
view,
finding--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--no,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
that
they
waived
sovereign
immunity
anywhere
foreign
law
would
apply.
the...
the
foreign
country
exception
bars
that.
we
think
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that's
right.
we
think
that
congress
has
waived
immunity
for
torts
occurring
in
the
united
states
and
has
not
waived
it
for
torts
occurring
outside
the
united
states.
the
presumptions
lead
in
that
direction
and
to
hold
otherwise
would...
would
require
this
court
to
conclude
that
in
the
ftca
congress
waived
sovereign
immunity,
but
didn't
create
venue
for
many
plaintiffs
and
directed
the
courts
to
apply
the
law
of
a
place
that
doesn't
have
any
tort
law
to
apply.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
it's
not
our
submission.
and
as--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well
i...
i
hesitate
to...
to
attempt
to
apply
the
six-factor
test
set
out
in
the
restatement.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i...
i
think
oregon
can
decide.
oregon
is
not
bound
by
the
language
of
1346(b)
in
the
case
of
a
suit
between
two
private
parties
and
can--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes.
but
petitioner
seeks
to
apply
oregon
law
here
and
that's
not
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
and
that's
why,
in
our
view,
we
should--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--if...
if
the
oregon
court
so
decided,
nothing
in
1346(b)--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
i...
i
don't
think
oregon
law
becomes
antarctica
law
just
because
it
might
be
applied
in
a
private
suit.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
i
don't.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
would--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
