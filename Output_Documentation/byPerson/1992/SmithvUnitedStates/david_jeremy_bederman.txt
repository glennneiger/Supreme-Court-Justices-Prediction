mr.
david
j.
bederman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
husband,
john
emmett
smith
travelled
to
antarctica
as
an
employee
of
a
government
contractor,
and
because
of
the
government's
negligence
died
in
antarctica.
this
case
comes
under
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
the
sole
avenue
by
which
mrs.
smith
can
sue
the
government,
and
concerns
the
proper
construction
of
the
act's
foreign
country
exception,
which
the
government
contends
bar
jurisdiction
here.
petitioner
maintains
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
foreign
country
exception
is
to
ensure
that
the
united
states'
liability
under
the
act
is
not
governed
by
the
tort
law
of
a
foreign
power.
it
is
undisputed
here
that
antarctica
is
a
sovereignless
region
and
has
no
civil
tort
law
of
its
own,
and
therefore
petitioner
maintains
that
antarctica
cannot
be
a
foreign
country
for
the
purposes
of
the
ftca.
now,
averring
to
that
point,
the
chief
point,
that
the
sole
purpose
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act's
foreign
country
exception
was
to
prevent
intrusion
of
foreign
law
into
domestic
litigation,
we
believe
this
conclusion
is
amply
supported
by
this
court's
only
previous
opportunity
to
review
the
foreign
country
exception,
which
was
in
spelar
v.
the
united
states.
moreover,
petitioner
submits
that
the
emphasis
on
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
foreign
tort
law
leads
to
consistent
results,
particularly
when
there
is
ambiguity
over
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
foreign
territorial
sovereign.
and
thirdly,
on
this
primary
point,
petitioner
maintains
that
congress
is
well
aware
of
alternate
formulations
dealing
with
the
notion
foreign
country,
as
i
aver
permissive,
or
in
its
mandatory
forms,
and
therefore
we
can
fairly
interpret
the
foreign
country
exception
to
apply
in
this
case
to
an
area
that
is
sovereignless,
the
one
area
on
earth,
apart
from
the
high
seas,
we
contend
that
is
sovereignless.
if
this
is
the
case
and
if
these
premises
are
accepted,
again
it
is
undisputed
in
this
case
that
antarctica
is,
in
fact,
a
sovereignless
area
having
no
civil
tort
law
of
its
own.
now,
in
view
of
this,
petitioner
maintains
that
it
is,
in
fact,
the
government's
position
which
leads
to
illogical
and
peculiar
results.
the
first
instance
of
the
government's
position
would
be
to
interpret
the
act
so
that
antarctica
is
a
foreign
country,
which
would
have
the
effect,
the
government
maintains,
of
barring
mrs.
smith's
claim.
but
it
is
clear
on
the
record
that
if
mr.
smith
had
died
because
of
the
government's
negligence
just
a
mile
or
two
offshore
of
the
mcmurdo
station
on
the
southern
ocean,
that
that
claim
would
cognizable
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
dohsa,
for
the
suits
in
admiralty
act.
it
seems--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
the
law
applies
in
such
an
action
is
the
federal
general
maritime
law--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--as
distinct,
of
course,
from
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
well,
and--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--justice
souter,
petitioner
maintains
that
the
primary
object
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
is
to
place
the
government
in
exactly
the
same
position
as
a
private
individual
if
that
private
individual
were
a
tort
feasor.
there
is
no
question
that
if
this
were
a
case
between
mrs.
smith
and
the
government
contractor,
here
itt
antarctic
services,
and
that
claim
were
brought
in
oregon,
that
the
law
that
would
be
applied
in
this
case
under
either
notions
of
personal
sovereignty
or
under
the
conflicts
restatement
balancing
tests,
is
the
law
of
oregon
in
this
instance.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
agreed.
the
federal
tort
claims
act's
choice
of
law
provision
refers
to
the
place
where
the
act
or
omission
occurred.
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
relevant
act
or
omission
occurred
in
antarctica.
this
is
not
a
headquarters
claim.
but
we
maintain
that
the
logical
reading
of
that
provision
in
the
context
with
the
foreign
country
exception
and
the
rest
of
the
statute,
particularly
the
object
to
place
the
government
in
the
same
position
as
a
private
individual,
would
be
to
allow
the
suit.
and
the
choice
of
law
direction
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
there
seems
to
be
no
dispute
that
under
the
relevant
choice
of
law
principles,
the
clear
direction
is
to
apply
oregon
law
here.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
well,
justice
souter,
that's
clearly
the
holding
in
richards.
and,
of
course,
petitioner
does
not
dispute
that
holding
nor
does
the
government.
what
we
believe
is
that
implicit
in
the
choice...
even
though
antarctica
has
no
choice
of
law
rules
embedded
in
its
law,
because
it
has
no
law,
nonetheless
the
appropriate
choice
of
law
rule
to
advocate
is
the
notion
of
personal
sovereignty,
which
obviously
has
limited
relevance
today
because
there
are
virtually
no
places
in
the
world
aside
from
antarctica
that
have
no
civil
tort
law.
otherwise
it
is--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--justice
o'connor,
i
would
imagine
that
despite
the
conditions
in
somalia,
no
one
would
doubt
that
somalian
sovereignty,
as
one
would
understand
that,
is
still
intact.
and
somalia's
civil
tort
law,
although
we
might
not
recognize
it
as
such,
still
continues
in
force
and
that
it
would...
petitioner's
submission
would
not
be
that
somalia,
because
of
its
current
difficulties,
ceases
to
be
a
foreign
country.
again,
the
petitioner's
position
is
that
the
notion
of
looking
for
the
presence
or
absence
of
a
foreign
tort
law
only
comes
into
play
when
there
is
ambiguity
over
whether
there
is
a
presence
of
a...
of
a
foreign
territorial
sovereign.
the
government's
position
would
be
for
you
to
apply...
to
deviate
from
spelar
and
apply
a
bright
line
test.
but
there
are
dangers
in
that
that
the
courts
in
this
country
have
experienced,
particularly
a
few
years
back
with
the
international
legal
status
of
okinawa
after
the
end
of
world
war
ii,
where
the
courts
struggled
mightily
to
determine
whether
the
united
states
was
territorial
sovereign
on
okinawa,
but
ultimately
concluded
that
that
issue
was
not
important,
as
per
spelar,
because
japanese
tort
law
was
still
in
force.
again,
there
isn't
any
concern
in
this
case
about
a
foreign
tort
law
intruding.
and,
again,
if...
if
one
recognizes
that
the
purpose
of
the
ftca
is
to
place
the
government
in
the
same
position
as
a
private
tort
feasor,
the
government's
submission
would
basically
make
antarctica
the
legal
equivalent
of
a
black
hole.
that
is,
people
are
governed
by
no
law
there.
and
in
a
case
brought
by
sandra
jean
smith
against
a
private
contractor,
that...
that
case
would
have
to
be
nonsuited.
that
is
not
a
result
which
is
countenanced
in
anglo-american
jurisprudence.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
well--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--well,
justice
souter,
i
mean
not
to
get
into
a
discourse
about
whether
the
lex
loci
delecti
rule
is
still
the
rule
adopted
in
the
common
law
of
most
american
states,
it
seems
to
me
that
notions
of
personal
sovereignty
and
the
conflict
restatement
test
are
perfectly
consistent
with
the
choice
of
law
direction
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
as
this
court
recognized
in
richards,
it
is
incumbent
in...
sort
of
in
view
of
the
interstitial
character
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
recognition
of
sort
of
even
what
one
might
call
a
federalism
concern
in
applying,
in
this
case,
oregon
wrongful...
oregon's
wrongful
death
statute,
that
we
can
countenance
a
case
where
it
proceeds
on
some
notion
of
personal
sovereignty
or
under
balancing
of
factors.
the...
the
other...
again,
the
government's
position,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
one
that
suffers
from...
from
difficulties.
because
of
the
difficulty
of
reconciling
the...
the
result
if
john
emmett
smith
had
died
on
the
southern
ocean
just
offshore
of
the
mcmurdo
station
as
opposed
to
having
been
unlucky
enough
to
die
on
land,
that
seems
to
be
one
powerful
reason
to...
to
interpret
the
foreign
country
exception.
and
consistently,
we
think,
with
its
language,
to
include
antarctica
or
to
conclude
that
antarctica
is
not
a
foreign
country.
likewise,
i've
averred
to
what
i
regard
as
their
peculiar
position
that
antarctica
has
no
law,
and
necessarily
following
from
that
that
in
a
case
of
a
private
action,
that
no...
that
no
law
could
be
applied
and
the
case
would
be
nonsuited.
in
view
of
this,
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
the...
that
the
proper,
the
clear,
the
consistent
interpretation
of
the
foreign
country
exception
would
be
to
hold
that
antarctica
cannot
be
a
foreign
country.
that
concludes
my
argument
in
chief.
i'll
entertain
questions.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
i
reserve,
of
course,
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
i
hope
just
to...
chief
justice,
i
hope
just
to
briefly
aver
to
some
points
made.
first
and
most
importantly,
the
government
places
very
substantial
reliance
on
what
is
known
as
the
foley
presumption,
presumptioning
its
extraterritorial
application
of
acts
of
congress.
it's
petitioner's
submission,
as
is
evident
on
the
briefs,
that
the
foley
presumption
is
not
even
implicated
here,
as
this
court
has
consistently
said
that
the
foley
presumption
comes
into
play
when
there
is
a
risk
of
clash
with
foreign
laws,
and
there
is
no
possibility
of
such
a
clash
in
this
case.
and
moreover,
if
foley
is
read
carefully...
the
government
has
already
alluded
to
the
case
being
won
regarding
the
application
of
the
8-hour
act
to
iraq,
the
court
in
that
case,
justice
reed
writing,
made
it
a
point
to
say
that
where
the
u.s.
does
have
authority,
in
other
words
jurisdiction
based
on
nationality,
that
that
presumption
would
not
be
read
in
relation
to
the
act.
in
antarctica
the
united
states
does
have
authority
by
virtue
of
jurisdiction
based
on
nationality.
as
the
government
has
conceded
already,
congress
has
exercised
that
jurisdiction
regarding
taxation
and
in
criminal
matters.
again,
the
foley
presumption
simply
is
irrelevant
in
this
case.
now,
likewise
the
government
places
substantial
reliance
on
the
venue
problems,
and
the
government
makes
the
point
that
petitioner's
submission
would
simply
read
back
into
the
statute
language
which
had
been
dropped
out
specifically
by
congress,
that
language
having
to
do
with
a
categorical
ban
on
the
claims
of
aliens.
petitioner's
submission
does
no
such
thing.
petitioner
is
saying
that
where
a
claimant
has
a
domicile
in
the
united
states,
venue
is
laid
and
the
choice
of
law
direction
is
clear.
it
seems
to
me,
in
fact,
to
be
an
impermissible
canon
of
construction
that
would
deny
jurisdiction
to
one
claimant
because
a
different
claimant
would
have
difficulty
in
laying
a
venue.
and,
indeed,
in
terms
of
canons
of
construction
regarding
venue,
those
canons
go,
in
fact,
to
construing
venue
statutes
and
not
jurisdictional
statutes.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
chief
justice,
my
construction
of
1346(b)
is
that
if
a
private
party
would
be
liable
as
a
tort
feasor
in
antarctica...
to
mrs.
smith,
say,
as
plaintiff...
then
it
follows
that
the
government
would
likewise
be
liable.
and
as
the
government
has
conceded,
antarctica...
pardon
my
colloquialism...
is
not
a
legal
black
hole,
that
law
does
apply
there
by
virtue
of
these
choice
of
law
principles.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
that
would
be
so,
chief
justice,
if,
under
prevailing
choice
of
law
rules
a
private
tort
feasor
would
not...
there
would
be
no
law
applicable
in
a
private
action--
mr.
david
j.
bederman
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
well,
i
read
the...
the
government's
reading
of
1346(b)
is,
frankly,
disjunctive.
they
would
prefer
to
eliminate
the
languages
under
circumstances
where
the
united
states,
if
a
private
person.
they
would
prefer
to
read
out
that
clause
and
simply
look
at
the
last
provision
in
isolation.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
no,
chief
justice.
if
it
were
true
that
under
prevailing
choice
of
law
theories
a...
no
private
action
was
permissible
because
the
lex...
lex
loci
delecti
was
in
antarctica,
we
would
have
no
case.
but
that
is
not
the
law
and
therefore
the
fair
reading
of
the
entirety
of
1346(b),
in
conjunction
with
the
remainder
of
the
statute
including
the
foreign
country
exception,
leads
inevitably
to
a
finding
that
antarctica
is
not
a
foreign
country
and
that
this
action
can
proceed.
i
have
no
further
substantive
points.
mr.
david
j.
bederman
i
will
not
rise
to
that
invitation,
chief
justice.
[laughter]
