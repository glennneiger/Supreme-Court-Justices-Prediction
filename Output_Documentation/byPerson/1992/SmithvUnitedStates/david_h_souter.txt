justice
david
h.
souter
and
as
distinct
from
this...
under
the
tort
claims
act
and
hence
is
distinct
in
this
case
because
there
isn't
any
law
in
antarctica.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean
there's
no
law...
there's
no
tort
law
of
the
place
of
the
tort,
is
there
here?
so
even
if
you
win
on
your
argument,
why
don't
you
lose
on
the
ground
that
under
the
terms
of
the
tort
claims
act
there
is
no
law
that
can
be
applied
and
therefore
it
must
not
be
intended
to
apply
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
that...
that...
assuming
that
to
be
the
case,
the
fact
is
we've
still
got
the
tort
claims
act,
and
that's
not
what
the
tort
claims
act
provides.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
doesn't
the...
doesn't
the
reference
to
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
tort
include
the
choice
of
law
rule
of
the
place
of
the
tort,
so
you
don't
even
have
a
choice
of
law
rule
to
begin
with
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that...
that
doesn't
follow,
does
it?
because
in
a
case
brought
against
a
private
contractor
they
wouldn't
be
stuck
with
the
provision
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
saying
you
necessarily
have
to
apply
the
law
of
the
place
of
the
tort.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
could
then
have
no...
you
then
would
have
no
bar
to
such
theories
as
personal
sovereignty
and
so
on.
you'd
be
able
to
figure
out
some
way
to
find
some
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
wright,
is
it
correct
that
the
tort
claims
act
contains
a
specific
exception
for
high
seas
torts?
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
that
does
not
necessarily
implicitly
defeat
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
i
see.
mr.
wright,
even...
even
though
you
say
it's
really
just
a...
the
foreign
country
provision
is
just
a
reaffirmation
of
the
nonextraterritoriality,
that
there
is
some
reason,
was
there
not,
to
have
that
reaffirmation
of
nonextraterritoriality,
when
you
have
before
you
a
statute
that
calls
for
the
application
of
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
tort
occurred?
that...
were
it
not
for
that
foreign
country
exception,
one
might
have
been
able
to
say
that
implicit
in
that
there
was
a
notion
of
extraterritorial
application.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
doesn't
the
word
carrying
carry...
strike
that.
[laughter]
doesn't
the
word
carrying
suggest
even
more
strongly
than
the
word
use
in
this
context
an
offensive
or
protective
purpose?
i
mean,
carrying
is
not
a
broader
term
than
use,
which
is
what
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy
seemed
to
assume.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
it
also,
for
purposes
of
this
statute
in
your
judgment
at
least,
require
a...
an
offensive
or
protective
purpose
when
it
is
carried--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
how
about
the
definition
that
you
would
like
us
to
assume
in
deciding
this
case?
do
you
think
carrying
has
no
protective
or
offensive
purpose?
justice
david
h.
souter
should
we
construe
the
statute
to
import
that
requirement
of
an
offensive
or
protective
purpose
when
we
use...
when
the
statute
uses
the
word
carry?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
we
don't
do
that,
didn't
your
client
carry
the
weapon
in
relation
to
the
barter
that
he
later
engaged
in?
if
we
don't
adopt
that
particular
construction
in
this
case,
don't
you
lose
under
the
word
carry?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
he
was
discharged.
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
would
lose
if
he
had
been
charged
with
carry
if
you
adopt
the
broad
definition
that
you're
considering.
