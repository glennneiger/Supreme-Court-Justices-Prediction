justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i'm
trying
to
explain
why
congress
would
have
put
that
in,
since
the
ordinary
meaning
of
all
statutes
is
that
they
don't
have
extraterritorial
application.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
may
i
ask
on
the...
the
language
about
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
act
occurred,
is
that
the
language
in
subsection
(b)
that
we're
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
general
waiver
and
then
a
bunch
of
exceptions.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
argue
that
use
or
carry
means
carry
for
the
purpose
of
using?
justice
antonin
scalia
really?
i'm
surprised.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
think
you
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
anything
you're
carrying,
you're
using?
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we
really
haven't
accomplished
a
whole
lot
if
carry
means
what
you
say
it
means.
really,
i
mean,
it
may
be
important
to
this
case,
but
use
and
carry
covers
everything
in
the
world
then.
the
dispute
between
you
and
the
government
is
that
the
government
says
use
carries
everything
in
the
world,
and
you
say,
no,
it's
only
use
or
carry
that
covers
everything
in
the
world.
so,
for
later
cases,
this
dispute
is
really
not
very
important
i
suppose.
with
due
respect,
justice,
i
disagree.
and
the
reason
i
would
disagree
is
because
the
decisions
that
are
cited
by
the
government
in
its
brief
and
some
of
the
decisions
that
i
cite
in
our
brief
is
that
there
are
situations
that...
where
somebody
has
a
firearm
that
is
located
proximally
to
where
drugs
are
being
held,
and
those
people
have
been
convicted
of
use,
people
who
have
been
convicted
of
use
who
have
firearms
that
are
totally
inoperable,
that
do
not
have
firing
pins,
do
not
have
ammunition,
that
are
located
in
remote
locations.
those
people
have
also
been
convicted
of
use
under
their
definition
and
the
majority
of
the
lower
courts'.
in
fact,
in
justice
white's...
in
justice
thomas'
dissent
in
mewks
v.
united
states,
that
was
their
concern
that
this
definition
of
the
word
use
is...
becomes
an
all-encompassing
definition
and
it
means
possession
and
presumes
the
intent
to
use.
so,
not
only
is
this
important
to
the
case
of
john
angus
smith,
but
it
is
important
to
countless
others
who
may
possess
firearms
and
not
have
a
use.
moreover,
with
this
definition
that
the
government
encourages
here,
both
in
the
lower
courts
and
from
this
court,
it
also
encourages
the
lower
courts
to
engage
in
psycho
journeys
into
the
defendants'
minds
to
try
and
determine
their
intent,
and
it
requires
situation-by-situation,
case-by-case
analyses--
--what
do
you
say
use
means
in
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kollin,
surely
a
court
that's
going
to
use
language
reasonably
enough
so
that
it
interprets
using
a
gun
to
mean
what
you
say
it
means,
using
it
in
a
crime,
would
also
not
be
so
unreasonable
as
to
interpret
the
phrase
carry
a
gun
to
mean
a
longshoreman
who's...
who
has
on
his
shoulder
a
crate
full
of
weapons
that
he's
taking
off
the
ship.
i
mean,
if
we're
reasonable
for
the
one,
don't
you
think
we
should
be
reasonable
for
the
other
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
say
in
some
sense,
of
course,
that
the
longshoreman
carrying
this
crate
is
carrying
a
gun,
but
that's
not
what
you
mean
when
you
say
are
you
carrying
a
gun.
or
when
the
policeman
in...
you
know,
arrests
the
person
and
searches
and
says
are
you
carrying,
i
mean,
he's
not
saying
are
you
lifting.
he's
talking
about
whether
you
have
a
gun
on
your
person
with
the
intent
of
using
it.
of
course,
i
suppose
the
longshoreman
also
has
to
be
also
be
carrying
some
drugs,
or
the
statute
doesn't
apply.
