mr.
james
e.
doyle
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
wisconsin
penalty
enhancement
statute
quite
simply
does
not
punish
thought
and
it
does
not
punish
the
expression
of
any
idea
or
belief.
it
punishes
criminal
conduct.
mr.
mitchell
was
and
is
free
to
think
any
thought
he
wants
to
think.
he
was
and
is
free
to
express
that
thought
in
any
legitimate
manner.
but
when
he
violates
the
wisconsin
criminal
code
he
subjects
himself
to
the
punishment
of
the
state
of
wisconsin,
and
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
state
of
wisconsin
through
its
legislature
and
courts
to
consider
his
reason
for
committing
the
crime
in
determining
what
the
appropriate
sentence
should
be.
on
the
face
of
this
statute
there
is
no
reason
to
suggest
that
wisconsin
is
involved
in
some
sinister
motive
to
control
thought.
the
statute
is
in
our
brief
at
page
3,
and
we
believe
that
it
quite
clearly
serves
two
very
legitimate
state
interests.
it
punishes
criminal
conduct
and
assesses
the
appropriate
penalty
range
for
a
particular
type
of
crime,
and
it
addresses
the
harmful
effects
of
discriminatory
conduct.
nobody
suggests
that
wisconsin's
interest
in
dealing
with
the
harmful
effects
of
discriminatory
criminal
conduct
are
not
substantial.
45
other
states
in
this
country
have
adopted
laws
of
some
sort
attempting
to
deal
with
this
problem.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
it
is
our
view
that
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin
decided
in
law
that
the
wisconsin
statute
punished
thought.
they
did
not
go
through
any
kind
of
statutory
construction,
there
was
no
issue
about
the
meaning
of
a
particular
word,
there
was
no
discussion
of
legislative
history,
there
was
no
ambiguity
in
the
statute.
they
came
to
a
conclusion
in
which
they
declared
that
the
statute
punishes
thought.
that
is
a,
in
my
judgment
a
conclusory
constitutional
statement.
in
fact
that's
the
same
as
saying
it
violates
the
first
amendment.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
it
very
much
depends
on
what
the
analysis
was.
if
it
turns
on
the
meaning
of
a
phrase,
if
it
turns
on
the
meaning
of
what
particular
language
means,
i
think
you
would
have
to
respect
the
decisions
of
the
state
supreme
court
with
respect
to
what
the
language
is
on
the
statute.
but
when
you
are
dealing
with
what
the
practical
effect
in
first
amendment
terms
is
of
a
particular
kind
of
statute,
and
balanced
against
first
amendment
standards,
then
i
think
that
you
may,
that
that's
a
first
amendment
question
that
this
court
may
consider.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
your
honor.
and
in
fact
in
reading
that
opinion
it's
quite
clear
that
they
not
only
looked
at
the
wisconsin
statute,
they
in
fact
declared
what
hate
crime,
as
they
declared
it,
hate
crime
statutes
in
general
what
the
first
amendment
consequences
were.
they
looked
at
the
model
adl
statute
for
example
and
declared
what
these
kinds
of,
what
these
kinds
of
laws
mean
in
first
amendment
terms.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
is
their
conclusion,
that
they
then
lead
into
their
reasons.
they
then
go
to
the
adl
statute
and
then
at
page
37
of
the
appendix,
the
joint
appendix
and
their
opinion,
they
say
that
the
wisconsin
statute,
based
on
the
history
of
these
anti-biased
statutes,
plural,
looking
at
anti-biased
statutes
in
general
punish
bigoted
bias.
so
i
believe
that
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
was
taking
a
very
broad
look
at
what
it,
at
a
genre
of
laws
that
it
labeled
hate
crimes.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
what
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
has
not
put
into
its
opinion
and
that
i
would
ask
this
court
to
look
at
directly
are
the
terms
of
the
wisconsin
statute.
the
terms
of
the
wisconsin
statute,
for
example
with
respect
to
what
is
punished,
states
very
clearly
that
the
penalties
for
the
underlying
crime
will
be
enhanced.
it
is
the
punishment
for
the
underlying
crime
that
is
being
enhanced
by
this.
so
on
the
face
of
the
wisconsin
statute
we
have
a
statute
that
is
punishing
the
criminal
conduct
of
todd
mitchell,
not
some
abstract
thought
that
he
may
have
engaged
in.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
believe
there
is
no
constitutional
difference,
although
let
me
add
i
think
the
wisconsin
case
is
even
cleaner
than
the
second
one
that
you
gave,
that
because
in
order
to
get
into
the
enhanced
punishment...
we
have
not
tried
to
create
any
type
of
new
crime.
you
have
to
violate
the
generally
applicable
laws
of
the
state
of
wisconsin
in
order
to
even
be
eligible
for
the
penalty
enhancement.
so
we
don't
run
into
some
of
the
problems
that
some
other
attempts
at
this,
some
other
states
may
have
attempted
of
trying
to
define
some
new
kind
of
offense.
we
have
dealt
with
this
strictly
as
a
sentencing
matter.
let
me
say
that
i
believe
that
the
state's
interest
in
dealing
with
these
problems
is
evidenced
by
the
facts
of
this
case
itself.
todd
mitchell
participated
in
the
brutal
beating
of
a
14-year
old
boy
walking
down
the
street
of
his
home
town
in
kenosha,
and
the
facts
of
this
case
are
very
clear
that
that
young
14-year
old
boy
would
never
have
been
beaten
except
for
his
race.
this
case,
wisconsin's
statute
was
in
place,
fortunately,
which
quite
directly
dealt
with
that
kind
of
criminal
conduct.
it
assessed
the,
the
wisconsin
legislature
assessed
the
kind
of,
had
determined
the
appropriate
sentencing
range
and
the
judge
assessed
the
proper
sentence
for
the
criminal
conduct
that
was
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
it
is
likely
you
would
not
find
one
so
clear.
this
is
obviously
a
very
clear
case.
but
let
me
say
wisconsin
is,
again
has
afforded
the
defendant
an
added
protection
that
i
don't
think
even
dawson
would
require,
for
example,
which
is
the
factual
basis
that
he
intentionally
selected
the
victim
because
of
the
victim's
race
must
be
there
and
it
must
be
proven
by
the
prosecutor
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so
the
defendant
in
this
case,
this
is
not
simply
a
judge
saying
that
i
have
heard
the
evidence
and
i
believe
based
on
the
evidence
that
there
was
a
motive
that
i
am
going
to
impose
a
higher
sentence
than
i
would
normally
impose.
this
is
a
finding
by
a
jury,
proven
by
the
prosecutor
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
victim
was
selected
because
of
the
victim's
race.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
it
is.
the
jury
is
given
a
special
verdict
under
the
wisconsin
penalty
enhancement
statute
and
it
is,
they
return
two
verdicts,
guilt
or
innocence
on
the
charge
and
as
well
as
the
question
on
whether
or
not
the
defendant
intentionally
selected
the
victim
because
of
the
victim's
race,
or
whatever
the
particular
status
may
be
in
the
case.
and
it
is
that
point,
i
believe,
that
is
extremely
important
in
this
case.
what
the
wisconsin
statute
does
is
look
at
the
intentional
selection
of
the
victim.
there
is
a
lot
of
talk
about
biased
thought,
hate
thought,
and
so
on.
the
wisconsin
statute
does
not
go
after
biased
thought
or
hate
thought.
we
don't
know
whether
mr.
mitchell
had
racial
bias
or
not.
it's
likely
he
did
given
the
facts
of
the
case,
but
we
don't
know.
and
to
a
large
measure
in
wisconsin
we
don't
care.
for
example,
mr.
mitchell
might
have
selected
that
victim
because
of
his
race
simply
to
show
off
to
the
group
of
young
men
that
was
around
him
about
how
tough
he
was
or
some
other
reason.
we
don't
know.
mr.
mitchell
may
have
the
benignest
thoughts
about
race
relations
as
are
possible,
and
yet
he
would
be
guilty
under
the
wisconsin
law
because
he
intentionally
selected
the
victim
because
of
the
victim's
race.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
believe
that
in
view
of
the
state
if
the
particular
category
serves
a
legitimate
state
interest
and
meets
equal
protection
tests
and
meets
vagueness...
some
of
the
examples
you
have
given,
justice
scalia,
i
think
would
be
difficult
obviously
to
put
into
a
statute
that
would
meet
the
vagueness
test.
but
if
it
meets
those,
that--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--i
believe
that--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--no,
that
would
not
be
the
legitimate
state
interest.
the
legitimate
state
interest
is
if,
for
example,
you
have
had
a
problem
in
your
state,
there
is
a
large
debate
going
on
about
flat
or
round
earth
and
there
have
been
a
great
number
of
fights
that
have
gone
on
in
your
state
for
a
period
of
time
and
the
state
legislature
decides
that
the
violence
attached
to
this
debate
is
one
that
needs
to
be
addressed
and
that
people
who
are
acting
out
of,
who
are
selecting
victims
because
of
that
reason
present
a
particular
danger
to
the
community,
then
i
think
the
state
could
act.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
that's
right,
whether
they
present,
in
a
traditional
criminal
context
that
they
present
a
significant
law
enforcement
problem
to
the
state
of
wisconsin.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
think
that
in
my
judgment
it
would
not,
and
i
believe
in
dawson,
if
in
fact
the
statute
was
strictly
limited
to
racial
motives,
which
the
wisconsin
statute
isn't,
if
it
were
that
dawson
would
suggest
that
that
would
be
appropriate.
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
the
wisconsin
statute
is
one
step
removed
from
that.
wisconsin
was
very
careful
in
drafting
this
statute.
it
used
language
that
is
found
very
clearly
patterned
and
found
in
hundreds
of
anti-discrimination
and
civil
rights
laws,
some
of
them
civil,
many
of
them
criminal,
contrary
to
the
assertion
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
in
which
people
are
prosecuted
for
conduct
that
is
carried
out
on
the
basis
of
race,
religion,
and
other
types
of
motives
along
those
lines.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
believe
there
are
some
categories
that
should
very
clearly
raise
a
concern
in
the
court,
in
courts
on
whether
or
not
there
is
suppression
of
ideas
that
are
afoot.
and
i
believe
certainly
a
category
that
mentioned
opposition
to
a
government
policy
would
be
such
a
category.
and
i
think
that
the
court
then
should
look
to
see--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--i
think
the--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--wisconsin,
while
i
think
we
would
all
like
to
do
away
with
the
notion
of
racial
bias,
wisconsin
by
this
law
and
by
the
face
of
this
law
is
not
seeking
to
suppress
racial
bias
or
the
notion
of
racial
bias.
it
is
seeking
to
address
the
harmful
effects
that
result
when
somebody
engages
in
criminal
conduct
in
which
they
have
selected
the
victim
because
of
that,
the
victim's
race.
this
is
not
a
statute
where
we
have
attempted
to
outlaw
cross
burning
or
other
kinds
of
expressive
communicative
conduct.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
yes,
i
think
certainly
it
is.
i
think
for
example
if
you
had
a
statute
that
said
all
drunk
drivers
who
are
racist
will
receive
an
extra
year
in
prison,
i
think
under
dawson
quite
clearly
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
and
again
wisconsin
statute
has
been
drafted
very
carefully
to
create
that
nexus
with
the
term
because
of.
not
only
is
the
nexus
there,
but
in
wisconsin
it
has
to
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
order
for
the
enhancer
to
apply.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
i
believe
that
that
is
correct
in
the
draft
card,
particularly
when
you're
dealing
with
the
motive
being
opposition
to
a
government
policy.
i
think
in
that
case
the
court
should
consider
whether
there
is
government
suppression
of
ideas
afoot
and
should
consider
whether
there's
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
the
enhancement.
and
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
articulate
a
legitimate
state
interest
in
choosing
one
side
of
the
debate.
the
better
analogy
to
the
wisconsin--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--i
would
say
that
that
would,
it's
far
removed
from
the
wisconsin
example,
but
i
think
that
it
would
present
to
the
court
a
legitimate
concern
that
the
government
is
attempting
to
suppress
ideas
of
the
government.
the
analogy
that
is
closer
to
the
wisconsin
is
if
you
say
there
is
an
assault
and
the
reason
for
the
assault
is
because
of
beliefs
about
the
war,
without
choosing
one
side
or
the
other,
would
serve
the
state
purpose
that
because
of
increased
criminal
activity
that
may
come,
without
any
suggestion
that
the
state
is
taking
one
side
or
another
in
a
particular
political
debate.
let
me,
if
i
might
follow
up
on
that,
i
want
to
be
clear
that
in
my
judgment
i
do
not
believe
the
state
is
taking
sides
in
this.
this
is
much
of
what
goes
on
in
this
kind
of,
in
this
debate.
we
are...
if
there
were
an
example
in
which
the
judge
had
a
7-year
range
of
sentences
at
the
beginning
and
the
judge
said
i
would
normally
give
1
year
in
this
case
but
i'm
going
to
give
2
more
because
based
on
the
evidence
i
have
seen
i
see
that
you
were,
you
moved
only
because
of
the
victim
and
i
think
you
present
a
greater
danger
to
the
community
because
of
that,
i
think
that
that
would
be
perfectly
appropriate.
in
this
case--
mr.
james
e.
doyle
--in
my
view
that
would,
assuming
that
there
is
in
fact,
as
there
was,
a
real
disruption,
i
think
that
that
would
be
constitutional.
i
would
like,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve.
mr.
james
e.
doyle
thank
you,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
the
questions
about
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
and
whether
they
went
beyond
statements
about
whether
this
just
simply
applies
to
bias
and
thought,
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
footnote
13
in
the
appendix
and
the
petition
for
the
writ
at
page
14,
in
which
the
court
says
while
the
statute
as-written
may
extend
to
situations
where
the
actor
in
fact
is
not
biased,
this
does
not
save
the
statute.
so
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
at
least
to
this
instance
did
read
the
words
of
the
statute
and
did
recognize
that
the
words
of
the
statute
extend
to
somebody
who
is
not
in
fact
biased.
further,
with
respect
to
several
of
the
questions,
justice
thomas'
question
at
the
end,
let,
i'd
like
the
record
to
be
clear
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
evidence
put
in
at
the
trial
court
by
the
state
other
than
the
facts
of
the
case
themselves
and
the
words
about
go
get
a
white,
are
you
all
hyped
up
to
get
a
white
boy.
there
was
no
evidence
put
in
by
the
state
about
any
underlying
bias
on
the
part
of
mr.
mitchell.
to
this
day
the
state
does
not
know
whether
mr.
mitchell
harbors
biased
thoughts
or
benign
racial
thoughts.
i
suspect
they
are
not
good
based
on
the
crime
itself,
but
there
was
no
evidence
on
that.
and
finally
i'd
like
to
mention
just
briefly
the
in
whole
or
in
part
so
that
there's
no
confusion.
that's
an
amendment
to
the
statute
that
occurred
after
this
particular
case
came
up.
the,
wisconsin
generally
defines
because
of
as
a
substantial
factor
test.
justice
bablitch
in
his
dissent
indicated
that
it
was
a
substantial
factor
and
a
kind
of
a
hybrid
substantial
factor
but-for
test.
and
in
fact
the
jury
instruction
that
was
not
objected
to
that
is
part
of
the
record
