mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
statute
punishes
thought,
thought
which
the
government
disapproves.
todd
mitchell
got
2
years
for
aggravated
battery
and
he
got
2
more
years
on
top
of
that
because
he
was
biased
against
white
people.
this
bias
is
a
crude
and
ugly
one,
but
it
was
nonetheless
a
viewpoint.
and
if
we
punish
todd
mitchell's
viewpoint
we
have
to
be
prepared
to
condone
punishment
of
any
viewpoint.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
he
was
punished
for
the
conduct
by
the
battery
statute.
the
enhancer
that
is
at
issue
in
this
case
punished
him
solely
because
of
his
biased
motive.
all
the
conduct
that
he
committed
was
already
separately
punished.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
your
honor,
the
state
can't
ever
punish
a
viewpoint.
the
proper
position
of
the
state
with
respect
to
beliefs
and
ideas
is
one
of
epistemological
humility.
the
state
can't
separately
and
additionally
single
out
a
racial
bias
or
a
religious
bias
or
a
bias
against
homosexuals
or
a
bias
against
people
who
have
some
particular
view
on
the
abortion
issue
and
punish
those
biases.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
no.
title
vii
and
the
other
anti-discrimination
laws
are
distinguishable.
those
laws
punish
effects.
they're
not
interested
in
bigotry.
they're
interested
in
discrimination.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
they
do...
your
honor,
i
believe
that
this
court
said
in
griggs
that
you
could
prove
a
title
vii
violation
for
example
on
a
disparate
impact
theory.
if
you
can
prove
a
violation
of
the
law
on
a
theory
that
doesn't
involve
motive...
motive,
even
if
motive
is
used
in
title
vii
it's
inextricably
intertwined
with
the
conduct
that
is
punishable.
the
difference
between
title
vii
and
the
enhancer
laws
is
that
you
can't
get
at
the
discriminatory
conduct
without
also
implicating
the
motive.
this--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--no,
your
honor.
that,
that
law
would
be
in
many
respects
irrational.
but
the
point
with
this
case
is
that
the
conduct
is
already
completely
punished.
the
state
of
wisconsin
has
chosen
on
top
of
that
to
impose
a
separate
and
additional
punishment
solely
because
of
these
particular
beliefs.
it's
not--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--your
honor,
the
interest
that's
served
by
title
vii
is
that
of
providing
equal
opportunity,
equal
opportunity
to
people
who
have
been
historically
discriminated
against.
equal
opportunity
is
very
different
than
bigotry.
there's
no
interest
of
equality
or
equal
opportunity
involved
in
this
particular
statute.
there's
no
equal
opportunity
to
battery.
so
the
statutes
are
very
different
in
that
respect.
they
serve
different
interests.
one
targets
bigotry,
one
seeks
to
promote
equal
opportunity.
this
statute
says
nothing
about
harms
or
effects.
it
speaks
only
of
certain
prohibited
biases.
the
statute
punishes
some
biases,
for
example
a
racial
bias,
but
it
doesn't
punish
other
biases,
for
example
a
gender
bias.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
numerous
content-neutral
alternatives
which
would
serve
the
state's
asserted
interests
equally
well,
if
not
better.
one
content-neutral
alternative
is
present
sentencing
practice
where
judges
every
day
of
the
year--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--this
statute
is
directed
at
motive.
an
enhancer,
if
you
wanted
to
have
an
enhancer
you
could
have
an
enhancer
based
on,
follow
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
which
has
a
model
enhancing
penalties
where
there
is
a
vulnerable
victim.
or
if
you
want
to
get
at
terror
or
emotional--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--the
because
of
is
the
problem
with
this
statute.
the
wisconsin
statute--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--no,
your
honor.
most
criminal
statutes
define
the
conduct
in
terms
of
two
elements,
the
actus
reus
and
the
mens
rea,
that
is
intent.
intent
is
different
than
motive.
what's
wrong
with
this
statute
is
that
it
doesn't
talk
about
intending
to
batter
someone
who
is
disabled.
it
talks
about
the
why,
the
underlying
belief
system.
that's
what
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
interpreted
the
because
of
to
mean,
and
that's
the
problem
with
the
statute.
the
statute
is
phrased
in
terms
of
the
belief
system
of
the
perpetrator.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
sure.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
your
honor,
no.
the
wisconsin
supreme--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--the
wisconsin
supreme
court
interpreted
the
because
of
to
mean
biased
motive.
that
construction
is
binding
on
this
court.
the
underlying
conduct
of
intentional
selection
occurs
in
all
cases.
in
order
to
be
convicted
under
this
statute
as
this
statute
appears
before
this
court
it
requires
a
biased
motive,
a
prejudice,
a
belief
system
opposing
whites.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
that's
correct.
if
you
look
at
the
wisconsin
supreme
court,
if
you
look
at
every
single
application
to
date
of
this
crime.
it's
after
all,
justice
stevens,
it's
called
a
hate
crime
statute,
and
that's
what
it's
directed
at.
it
punishes
hate.
it
punishes
crimes
which
are
committed
which,
with
a
certain
mind
set
and
certain
animus
which
is
in
this
particular
case
not
just
a
motive
for
a
crime
but
a
generalizable
belief
system
about
a
particular
public
matter.
it's
a
crude
belief
system,
certainly,
but
it
nevertheless
is
a
viewpoint.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
your
honor,
the
selection
of
the
victim
is
part
of
the
underlying
crime.
all
crimes
involve
a
selection
of
a
victim.
the
operative
words
of
this
statute
are
not
selection
of
the
victim.
because
of
as
construed
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
because
of
means
biased
motive.
and
in
addition
all
the
evidence
concerning
this
particular
statute
makes
it
clear
that
that's
what
is
being
talked
about.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
the
sponsors
basically
said
that
the
purpose
of
this
law
is
to
impose
additional
penalties
because
of,
perpetrated
because
of
someone's
religious
or
social
biases.
all
of
the
applications
of
this
law
to
date
have
been
to
situations
involving
a
biased
motive.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
well,
your
honor,
even
though
the
state
may
come
up
with
a
few
marginal
creative
hypotheticals
which
would
involve
a
hypothetical
of
someone
who
was
committing
hate
crimes
without
hate,
that's
essentially
what
their
hypothetical
is,
those
would
be
the
most
remote
and
marginal
applications
of
this
law.
i
know
of
no
such
application
across
the
country
so
far.
and
that's
not
what
this
statute
is
about.
this
statute,
contrary
to
these
creative
hypotheticals,
is
about
biased
crime
or
hate
crime.
the--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
court
clearly
was
not
thinking
of
these
various
hypotheticals
posed
by
the
state--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--i
don't
think
the
court
says
that
explicitly,
but
i
think
it's
clear
that
that's,
that
their
interpretation
is
to
bias.
i
might
also
add
on
that
point,
justice
souter,
that
the
state
itself
in
their
cert
petition
on
page
16
concedes
that
the
statute
is
about
prohibiting
bias-motivated
action.
furthermore,
when
the
state
talks
about
such
cases
as
dawson,
which
have
to
do
with
the
admissibility
of
biased
motive
and
first
amendment
protected
activity,
the
state
then
concedes
essentially
that
we're
talking
about
a
biased
motive.
it's
only
when
the
state
talks
about
the
facial
challenge
that
then
they
say
well,
it
doesn't
involve
biased
motive,
but
then
when
they
talk
about
dawson
they
say
well,
biased
motive
is
okay.
so
the
state
is
really
trying
to
have
it
both
ways.
it's
clear
what
this
statute's
about
and
it's
clear
that
the
overwhelming
if
not
100
percent
of
the
applications
will
be
to
biased
motive.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
in
dawson
this
court
said
that
the
first
amendment
applied
its
sentence
and
that
biased
motive
or
belief
may
be
considered
as
evidence
of
a
content-neutral
sentencing
factor.
a
court,
whether
it's
a
court
or
a
legislature,
they
can't
impose
an
additional
penalty
because
the
court
or
the
legislature
disapproves
of
the
belief
of
the
defendant.
if
that
belief
is
relevant
to
a
content-neutral
sentencing
factor,
such
as
the
defendant
being
violent,
future
dangerousness,
lack
of
remorse,
the
court
may
consider
that
as
evidence.
and
in
dawson
this
court
said
that
they
can
consider
it
as
evidence
only
with
the
greatest
caution.
so
yes,
traditional
sentencing
practice
allows
courts
every
day
to
take
into
consideration
all
kinds
of
things,
including
biased
motive,
but
those
must
be
related
to
traditional
sentencing
factors
such
as
violence.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
it's
clear,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--well,
it's
clear
that
the...
yes,
we
do
not
dispute
that.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
that's
a
more
difficult
question,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
brings
up
another
problem--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--well,
your
honor,
that
might
have
been
argued
below
and
i
think
that
brings
up
another
problem
with
this
statute,
and
that
is
the
over-inclusivity.
if
the
1992
amendments
to
the
statute
clarify
the
meaning
of
the
original
law,
the
biased
motive
is
not
even
required
to
be
100
percent
biased.
in
fact
under
these,
under
this
law
you
could
have
a
1
percent
biased
motive
and
99
percent
some
other
motive,
a
greed
motive,
and
still
be
subject
to
the
enhanced
penalty.
the...
i
was
talking
about
the
content-neutral
alternatives,
and
the
real
problem
with
this
statute--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--that's
correct.
and
it's
clear
that
we
don't
know
what
the
quantum
of
motive
was
required
under
this
law,
but
under--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the,
that
the
1992
amendments
may
well
have
clarified
the
meaning
of
the
original
law,
and
it's
clear
that
the
law
now
that's
in
effect
in
wisconsin
covers
because
of
in
whole
or
in
part,
which
means
you
can
have
an
unconscious
amount
of
racism,
the
most
minute
percentage
of
disapproved
or
disfavored
motive,
and
still
be
subject
to
this
additional
penalty.
it's
clear
what
the
state
is
doing
here
is
that
they
were
searching
out
to
find
bias
wherever
they
could
find
it,
even
in
minute
qualities.
the
statute
also
covers
not
just
violent
crimes
but
it
covers
every
crime
in
the
whole
wisconsin
criminal
code,
including
such
minor
offenses
as
mooring
a
water
craft
to
the
wrong
pier.
that
can
be
enhanced
if
there's
a
1
percent
racial
bias.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
they
didn't
say.
and
the
in
whole
or
in
part
wasn't
the
law
as
it
applied
to,
wasn't
in
the
statute.
that
was
a
subsequent
amendment,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
because
of.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
well,
i
think
that
the
only,
i
think
it's
clear
because
they
wanted
to
get
at
even
minute
quantities
of
the
disfavored
motives.
it's
clear
that
that's
what
they're
trying
to
do
essentially,
and
that's
what's
wrong
with
the
statute.
not
only
are
there
content-neutral
alternatives
which
could
get
at
these
effects
without
implicating
bias,
and
we
have
mentioned
a
couple
of
them,
but
the
statute
also
is
over-inclusive.
and
what
that
makes
clear
is
that
there's
an
unspoken
purpose
to
this
law,
one
that
the
state
does
not
say,
and
that's
an
improper
and
unconstitutional
purpose,
and
that
purpose
is
essentially
to
find
little
bits
or
big
bits
of
prejudice
wherever
it
is
and
then
impose
an
enhancer.
this
statute
is
about
bigotry.
and
however
abhorrent
and
disgusting
bigotry
may
be,
it
is
nevertheless
a
viewpoint
which
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
the
evidence
in
the
record
suggests
that
this
statute
isn't
used
much
at
all
in
any
particular
situation,
but
it
surely
could
be,
your
honor.
prosecutors
and
law
enforcement
surely
under
this
law
have
the
discretion
to
apply
it
anywhere
they
want.
there's
a
huge
scope
for
discretion
here,
and
in
fact
that
i
think
is
another
serious
problem
in
this
case.
but,
as
i
was
saying,
the
unspoken
purpose
of
this
law
is
essentially
to
identify
certain
disfavored
prejudices
and
punish
them
wherever
they
find
them.
the
enhancer
is
not
narrowly
tailored.
it
is
also
under-inclusive
because
there
are
certain
situations
where
the
same
harms
would
occur
if
the
state
asserts
other
justifications
for
the
statute.
for
example
women.
women
are
not
a
protected
category.
you
get
more
time
if
you
commit
a
crime
against
somebody
because
of
their
sexual
orientation
but
not
because
of
their
gender.
surely
a
gender-based
crime
would
cause
the
same
terror
or
harm
that
the
state
asserts
as
its
reason
for
enacting
this
law.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
but
this
court
has
said
also
that
when
under-inclusivity
is
based
on
content
and
viewpoint
that
makes
the
statute
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
this
statute
is
subject
to
strict
scrutiny
because
it
does
punish
thought.
thought
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
content
and
viewpoint
specificity
of
this
law
is
not
necessary.
the
state--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--it's
possible,
but
i--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--the
point
is,
your
honor,
the
content
and
viewpoint
specificity
is
not
necessary.
a
decision
striking
down
this
law
is
not
a
decision
that
says
to
wisconsin
you
can't
do
this,
you
can't
deal
with
the
problem
of
biased
crimes.
all
it
is
is
a
decision
saying
do
this
the
right
way.
address
the
particular
harms.
pass
an
enhancer
if
you
will
which
addresses
harms
or
addresses
effects.
we
have
suggested
several
of
them.
if
the
penalties
are
insufficient...
i
mean,
after
all,
what
does
this
enhancer
do?
it
just
increases
the
judge's
ability
to
give
out
penalties.
well,
if
the
penalties
in
the
wisconsin
law
are
insufficient,
a
content-neutral
way
of
solving
the
problem
would
just
be
to
figure
out
those
crimes
where
you
need
larger
penalties,
increase
the
total--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--the
statute
can't
be
based
on
thought.
that's
the
problem
with
this
statute.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
if
it
was
because
of
your
views
on
race
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
one,
242
requires
state
action
under
color
of
state
law.
when
the
state--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--your
honor,
242
is
distinguishable
because
it
serves
a
different
interest.
what
242
does,
it's
a
narrowly
tailored
statute
which
is
addressed
at
specific
kinds
of
interference
with
federally
protected
or
federally
guaranteed
rights.
it
serves
to
protect
rights
that
the
federal
government--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--because
the
statute
is
not
directed
at
bias.
it
only
implicates
race
to
the
extent
necessary.
and
incidentally,
that
statute
if
subjected
to
strict
scrutiny
would
survive
strict
scrutiny
because
it's
not
directed
at
bigotry.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
i'm
sure
they
wouldn't,
your
honor,
because
in
that
case--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--the
bias,
the
motive,
and
the
conduct
are
inextricable.
the
problem
with
this
enhancer
law
is
that
the
conduct
is
already
punished
and
basically
what
they
have
done
is
added
a
separate
punishment
which
is
only
addressed.
it's
not
necessary
to
do
it
that
way.
they
could
address
the
problem
of
biased
crimes
without
punishing
thought.
and
that
suggests
that
really
what--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--no,
your
honor,
that's
not
true.
it's
because
there's
an
interference
with
federal
rights,
and
the
federal
government
has
an
obligation
to
protect
people--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--but
the
reason
you
need--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--you
need
that
because
of
in
that
statute
to
give
meaning
to
the
phrase
interference
with
federal
rights.
if
you
didn't
have
a
because
of,
that
would
be
a
too
general
law,
almost
as
if,
almost
like
the
issue
in
griffin
v.
breckenridge
where
the
court
read
in
a
kind
of
an
animus
to
give
specific
intent
to
avoid
the
shoals
of
a
federal
tort
law.
so
in
a
sense
that
proves
our
point,
your
honor,
because
there
the
bias
is
necessary.
it
would
pass
strict
scrutiny,
as
opposed
to
by
contrast
the
enhancer
law
where
the,
having
bias
in
the
law
is
totally
unnecessary
and
serves
no
purpose
other
than
to
punish
the
improper
motives.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
intention
is
different
than
motive,
your
honor.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
yes,
intention
affects--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--whatever
you
call
it,
in
your
hypothetical
that's
intent.
it
affects
the
conduct.
the
treason
statute
is
addressed
at
conduct.
it's
not,
it
doesn't
punish
you
for
being,
for
disliking--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--see,
you
could
turn
it
over
by
accident,
and
that
wouldn't
be
treason.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
that's
why
you
need
the
intent
in
there.
and
that's
not
motive,
it's
intent.
because
if
it
was
an
accident
it
wouldn't
be
any--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--i
believe
that
treason
statutes
don't
punish,
i
think
they
punish
the
intent--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--well,
your
honor,
intent
affects
the
what
of
conduct.
if
it's
reckless
or
if
it's
intentional
it's
different
conduct
than
if
it's
accidental
conduct.
i
don't
think
the
treason
statute--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--wisconsin's
concern
about
biased
crimes
is
well-intentioned.
it's
tempting
to
sacrifice
a
part
of
the
first
amendment
in
the
name
of
an
important
problem
such
as
racial
harmony,
but
the
first
amendment
protects
the
thought
we
hate
as
well
as
the
thought
that
we
like.
it
protects
the
viewpoints
of
even
inarticulate
people
like
todd
mitchell
as
much
as
the
viewpoints
of
the
erudite.
more
than
anything
minorities
need
an
uncompromised
first
amendment,
for
it
is
minorities
more
than
anyone
who
are
likely
to
think
the
thoughts
which
are
offensive
to
the
powers
that
be.
and
any
statute
that
gives
the
government
the
power
to
punish
thought
is
going
to
be
used
more
against
minorities
than
against
anyone.
so
in
fact
sometimes
this
case
has
been
talked
about
as
a
conflict
between
interests
of
liberty
and
interests
of
equality.
it's
not
that
at
all.
the
affirmance
of
this
wisconsin
supreme
court
decision
is
a
victory
for
the
first
amendment,
and
it's
also
a
victory
for
equality
and
for
the
rights
of
all
of
us
to
think
what
we
want.
that's
what
this
statute
does.
thank
you.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
yes,
justice
thomas.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
that's
correct.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
the
second
five...
any
kind
of
biased
motive
would
be
covered.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
yes.
i
think
both
would
be
covered.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
the
bias
is
a
racial
bias.
the,
you
can
have
a
bias
against
whites
or
a
bias
against
blacks.
either
way
is
a
bias,
your
honor.
either
is
a
viewpoint,
and
that
statute
is
content
and
viewpoint-specific.
if
it
punishes,
if
it's
a
statute
that
punishes
content
and
viewpoint-specificity
it's
subject
to
strict
scrutiny.
if
the
achievement,
if
that
goal
can
be
achieved
in
another
way
by
a
content-neutral
alternative,
then
the
state
has
an
obligation
to
do
it
and
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
the
statute
is
directed
at
bias,
racial
bias.
i
understand
you
said
that,
but
my
question
is
most
of
your
argument
seemed
to
depend,
or
at
least
your
assessment
of
bias
seems
to
depend
on
the
interracial
nature
of
the
crime.
i
am
putting
it
in
an
intraracial
context
to
at
least
isolate
the
notion,
the
existence
or
non
existence
of
bias.
the
statute
does
not
refer
to
bias,
so
where
is
the
bias
on
an
intraracial
basis?
in
order
to
prove
the
crime
on
an
intraracial
bias
under
the
construction
by
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
the
state
would
have
to
be
shown
that
there
was
an
intraracial
bias.
if
it
was
just
an
assault
without
a
bias...
and
an
intraracial
bias
is
a
hard
hypothetical
to
imagine--
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
--the
wisconsin
supreme
court
said
that
because
of
meant
biased
motive.
this
is
a
hate
crime
statute.
all
of
the
applications
of
this
statute
have
been
to
cases
involving
bias,
and
that's
an
element
of
the
state's
burden
of
proof.
mr.
lynn
s.
adelman
thank
you.
