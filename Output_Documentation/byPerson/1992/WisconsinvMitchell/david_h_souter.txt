justice
david
h.
souter
so
therefore,
going
back
to
your
prior
argument,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
reason
in
this
case
in
fact
was
the
expression
of
the
bigotry?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the
difference
between
the
draft
card
burning
enhancement
and
the
enhancement
here
rest
on
the
fact
that
no
one
burns
draft
cards
except
as,
in
effect
as
political
statements,
whereas
people
do
commit
assaults
for
different
reasons?
so
that
there
is
no
justification
in,
as
it
were,
in
an
increased
deterrence
in
the
draft
card
case,
and
therefore
the
only
purpose
that's
being
served
by
the
draft
card
enhancement
is
simply
kind
of
an
extra
punishment
of
the
thought?
justice
david
h.
souter
could
you
give
me
an
example
of
how
it
might
speak
in
terms
of
harms
and
effects
in
a
way
that
would
legitimize
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
wait
a
minute,
i
thought
you
were
objecting
to
the
statue,
statute
rather,
in
its
terms.
so
what
would
be
the
difference
in
the
terms
of
the
statutes
couched
in
terms
of
effects
that
would
legitimize
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
object
then
to
the
statute
insofar
as
it
refers
to
disabilities,
victims
with
disabilities?
it's
simply
the
mental
connection
between
the
act
and
the
disability
of
the
victim
that
taints
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
didn't
couch
the
statute
in
terms
of
because
of
wouldn't
your
sentencing
in
effect
be
a
potentially
random
act?
if
the
statute
did
not
describe
a
sentencing
criterion
in
terms
of
the
motive
for
the
act
you
would
seem
to
allow
the
sentencer
to
say
well,
if
the
victim
turns
out
to
be
a
disabled
person
i'll
go
ahead
and
add
a
kicker
if
i
want
to,
but
that
need
not
in
fact
have
any
relationship
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
beyond
the
possible
fortuity
of
the
victim's
disability?
is
that
what
you
would
be
allowing?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
adelman,
may
i
just
ask
you
a
technical
question?
it's
about
the
wisconsin
supreme
court's
construction.
i've
got
page
a7
in
the
petition
for
cert
which,
where
the
court's
opinion
is
set
out,
and
the
court
says
there
because
the
hate
crime
statute--
--where
about
on
the
page,
justice
souter?
it's
the
top
of
the
carry
over
paragraph,
the
last
sentence
in
that
paragraph.
it
says
because
the
hate
crime
statute
punishes
the
defendant's
biased
thought
as
discussed
below
and
thus
encroaches
on
first
amendment
rights,
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
prove
constitutionality.
clearly
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
is
saying
that
the
statute
covers
biased
thought.
does
the
court
ever
get
more
explicit
in
saying
that
that
is
all
it
covers
are
biased
action?
does
the
court
ever
get
more
explicit
in
saying
that
that
is
all
it
punishes?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be
but
i
just
want
to
stick
at
the
moment
to
the
specific
question.
does
the
court
get
more
explicit
later
on
in
saying
that
it,
that
the
statute
does
nothing
more
than
this,
covers
nothing
more
than
this?
