one
question,
mr.
adelman.
justice
clarence
thomas
there
were
10
individuals
involved
here?
justice
clarence
thomas
let's
assume
that
five
were
told
to
attack
a
white
person
and
five
said
they
would
attack
a
black
person,
for
whatever
reasons.
now,
the
first
five
of
course
would
be
covered
by
the
statute.
would
the
second
five
not
be
covered?
justice
clarence
thomas
the
statute
says
because
of
race.
justice
clarence
thomas
so
where
is
the
bias
in
the
second
five?
justice
clarence
thomas
so
you're
assuming
that
there's
intraracial
bias
simply
because
they
decided
to
attack
a
black
person
also?
justice
clarence
thomas
so
in
all
the
cases
that
you
are
aware
of
the
state
actually
had
to
prove
that
there
was
bias,
not
simply
that
this
individual
was
chosen,
the
victim
was
chosen
because
of
his
or
her
race,
for
whatever
reasons?
