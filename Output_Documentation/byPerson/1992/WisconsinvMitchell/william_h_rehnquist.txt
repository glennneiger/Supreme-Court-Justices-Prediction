chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
92-515,
wisconsin
v.
todd
mitchell.
general
doyle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ordinarily
we
decide
what
a
statute
is
directed
at
by
the
terms
of
the
statute
itself,
i
take
it,
don't
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
guess
in
most
cases
you're
not
going
to
get
nearly
as
clear
of
an
evidentiary
finding
as
you
did
in
this
as
to
the
motive
for
the
crime?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
submitted
to
the
jury
at
the
same
time
that
the
substantive
criminal
offense
is
tried?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
in
the
draft
card
case
the
statute
said
that
your
penalty
would
be
enhanced
if
you
did
it
because
of
disagreement
with
the
person's
views
about
the
vietnam
war,
whether
they
were
pro
or
con?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
doyle.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
a
state
which
had
no
history
whatsoever
of
any
race-motivated
crimes,
there
simply
had
never
been
any
in
that
state,
what
if
that
state
were
to
pass
a
statute
like
wisconsin's?
would
it
be
subject
to
any
additional
scrutiny
than
wisconsin's
is?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
there
any
evidence
that
disabled
people
have
been
beaten
up
because
they
are
disabled?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
thought
your
argument
was
that,
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
if
there
are
a
rash
of
church
burnings,
sure,
the
state,
the
federal
government
can
come
in
and
legislate
about
that.
but
here
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
there
hasn't
been
a
rash
of
anything
so
far
as
anybody
knows,
so
far
as
attacks
on
the
disabled
because
they
are
disabled.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
adelman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
supreme
court
of
wisconsin,
mr.
adelman,
comment
on
the
meaning
of
in
whole
or
in
part?
i
mean,
does
it
support
your
view
that
1
percent
would
be
sufficient?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
statute
say
at
the
time
your
client--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--because
of.
any
indication
why
the
legislature
amended
it
to
say
in
whole
or
in
part?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
record
of
the
way
the
statute
has
been
used
by
wisconsin
prosecutors?
i
mean
in
fact
are
people
who
moor
the
boats
at
the
wrong
dock
ever
charged
of
having
done
so
because
of
a
bigoted
motive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
our
cases
have
said
that
the
legislature
can
address
evils
one
at
a
time,
that
it
doesn't
have
to
cover
the
whole
waterfront,
so
to
speak,
in
one
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
the
wisconsin
legislature
thought
there
weren't
any
misogynists
in
wisconsin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
believe
so?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
adelman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
doyle,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
doyle.
the
case
is
submitted.
