suppose,
mr.
adelman,
suppose
wisconsin
had
a
separate
statute
that
said
if
you
do
this
sort
of
thing
because
of
race,
if
you
assault
another
person
on
account
of
race
you
must
have
a,
and
they
specify
the
minimum
penalty
which
is
just
larger
than
the
normal
assault
statute
has
in
it.
i
suppose
you
would
attack
that
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
you
would
also
say
that
the
statute
i
just
posited
would
be
unconstitutional?
a
separate
statute
saying
if
you
assault
anybody
on
account
of
race
it's
10
years,
whereas
the
regular
assault
statute
is
5
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
you
do
about
section
242
of
the
federal
criminal
code
which
says
that
if
you
deprive
any
person
of
a
right,
privilege,
or
immunity
protected
by
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
and
you
do
it
on
account
of
color
or
race,
you
have
committed
a
crime
and
you
are
punished
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so?
nevertheless
it
punishes
some
person
who
is
acting
under
color
of
state
law
for
this
conduct
that
he
is,
that
he
is
doing
on
account
of
race.
and
it's
on
account
of
race
or
color.
and
it
covers
only
the
crime
is,
has
to
be
motivated
by
race
or
color.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
so,
but
it's,
the
thing
that
makes
it
a
crime
is
that
the
conduct
is
engaged
in
because
of
race.
and
why
isn't
that
a
criminalizing
of
bias?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
suppose
that
your
supreme
court
would
declare
this
statute
unconstitutional.
it
would
just
read
it
and
say
that
this
statute
is,
has
to
be
aimed
at
bias.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
on
that
basis
i
would
think
242
would
be
even
more
suspect
because
it
just
isn't
an
enhancer.
the
only
reason
there's
any
kind
of
a
punishment
at
all
is
because
of
a
bias,
of
race-motivated
conduct.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
doesn't,
this
statute
doesn't
cover
all
interferences...
under
this,
this
statute
would
not
be
violated
by
someone
who
interfered
with
somebody's
federally
constituted,
protected
rights
for
some
reason
besides
race.
it
just
wouldn't
be
reached
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
have
a
separate
statute
here
criminalizing
conduct
motivated
by
race.
