justice
antonin
scalia
general
doyle,
your
state
supreme
court
was
of
the
opposite
view.
i
mean
your
state
supreme
court
said
that
in
fact
this,
or
in
law,
i
don't
know
which,
this
statute
does
control
thought.
now,
are
we
bound
by...
it's
after
all
their
statute.
it's
not
ours.
are
we
bound
by
their
determination
as
to
what
it
is
directed
at?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
some
other
state
supreme
court
came
to
the
same
disposition
that
your
state
supreme
court
but
used
legislative
history
and
decided
as
a
factual
matter
that
it
had
been
intended
to
punish
thought,
then
we
would
have
to
come
out
differently
in
your
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
limit
on
the
reasons
for
selection
that
the
state
can
specify
for
higher
punishment?
i
mean,
could
it
say
if
you
select
a
victim
on
the
basis
of
whether
or
not
he
believes
in
the
hole
in
the
ozone
layer?
could
you
do
that?
or
whether
he
believes
that
the
earth
revolves
around
the
sun
rather
than
vice-versa?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
serve
a
legitimate
state
interest?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
one
has
to
judge
whether
being
against
flat
earth
people
is
less
important
than
being
against
people
who
don't
like
particular
religions,
for
example?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
it
isn't
the
goodness
or
badness
of
the
idea
that
you're
talking
about,
it's
whether
attacks
on
the
basis
of
that
idea
are
a
particular
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
excuse
me,
i
thought
we
were
presenting
from
that
whether
the
objectives
are
good
or
bad,
but
you
say
the
objectives
have
to
be
a
legitimate
state
interest?
see,
i
thought
from
your
initial
answer
to
justice
souter
that
you
would
have
said,
or
i
gathered
from
justice
souter's
question
that
it's
a
different
case
if
you
say
you
get
an
enhanced
penalty
for
assault
if
the
reason
for
your
assault
is
that
the
person
you
assault
favors
the
vietnam
war.
you
would
say
that's
bad
too,
wouldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
be
an
equal
opportunity
criminal?
is
that
it?
you're
punishing
the
person
for
not
being
indiscriminantly
violent?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
suppressing,
it
has
an
interest
in
suppressing?
the
state
cannot
suppress
hatred
of
certain
religions
or
certain
races,
can
it?
i
mean,
it
can't
throw
somebody
in
jail
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
the
state
can
do
is
to
foster
the
opposite,
to
show
its
disapproval
of
that
attitude.
it's
entitled
to
do
that,
right,
in
statements
by
the
president,
in
pronouncements
by
the
congress?
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
can
do
that
for
patriotism
as
well,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
can
you
punish
a
crime
more
severely
if
the
crime
demonstrates
a
lack
of
patriotism?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
acknowledged
that
there's
some
limit
on
that,
that
even
in
doing
that
the
state
can
seem
to
be
trying
to
suppress
an
idea,
and
then
it
would
be
bad.
that's
what
i
thought
you
were
acknowledging.
justice
antonin
scalia
disability?
have
we
had
a
rash
of
people
going
around
beating
up
on
the
handicapped?
i'm
not
aware
that
that's...
i
mean,
i
can
understand
the
other
things,
religion,
race,
yes,
sexual
orientation,
national
origin
or
ancestry,
but
not
disability.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
title
vii?
i
mean,
i
can
fire
somebody
because
i
don't
like
the
way
he
combs
his
hair.
i'm
entitled
to
do
that
as
far
as
federal
law
is
concerned.
but
i
can't
fire
that
same
person
because
of
his
race,
religion,
and
so
forth.
are
those
laws
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
don't
punish
effects.
i
could
produce
the
same
effect
firing
this
individual.
it's
only
because
i
have
this
motive
in
firing
him
that
i
am
held
liable.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
inextricably
intertwined.
the
person
is
not
punished
unless
he
has
committed
the
crime,
the
substantive
assault
or
whatever
it
is.
would
your
objection
be
eliminated
if
it
were
not
an
enhancer,
if
there
were
let's
say
no
law
against
assault
unless
you
assault
because
of
the
person's
race?
that
would
be
okay
by
analogy
to
title
vii?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
adelman,
suppose
you
didn't
have
a
statute
and
you
just
have
a
normal
prosecution
for
a
murder.
the
defendant
is
convicted
and
the
judge,
a
common
law
judge
sentencing
says
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
particularly
harsh
sentence
because
you
are
a
person
who
believes
in
violence.
you
are
a
particularly
vicious
and
obnoxious
person
because
of
your
belief
in
violence.
now,
judges
have
always
done
that
throughout
the
history
of
the
common
law.
isn't...
what's
the
matter
with
believing
in
violence?
that's
a
belief
system
too.
people
can
go
around
believing
in
violence.
you
can't
punish
them
for
that,
can
you?
but
if
they
commit
some
other
crime
you
can
send
them
up
for
longer
than
you
otherwise
would
because
of
their
belief
system.
we
have
always
done
that.
so
what's
so
unusual
about
doing
it
in
this
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
treason
and
espionage
laws
which
make
certain
acts
unlawful
if
committed
with
the
intent
to
give
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemy?
i'm
certainly
entitled
to
wish
the
enemy
well
in
a
war
that
my
country's
engaged
in.
i
don't
think
i
can
be
put
in
prison
for
hoping
that
my
country
loses.
but
if
i
perform
an
act
which
otherwise
would
be
lawful,
but
i
do
that
act
with
the
intention
of
helping
the
enemy--
justice
antonin
scalia
--intention
is
different
from
motive?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
then
strike
it.
i
do
it
with
a
motive
of--
[laughter]
--of
helping
the
enemy.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
the
conduct
is
turning
over
the
information.
the
conduct
is
simply
an
act.
maybe
it's
bombing
something,
maybe
it's
disclosing
secret
information.
but
the
only
thing
that
makes
it
treason
is
that
i
do
it
with
the
motive
of
giving
aid
and
comfort
to
the
enemy.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
no,
but
i...
no,
i
can
turn
it
over
intentionally
and
i
know
i
am
giving
it
to
this
person.
it's
fully
intentional.
but
unless
my
motive
is
to
help
the
enemy
it's
not
treason.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you're
wrong.
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
that
and
what's
going
on
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
treason
statutes
are
directed
against
bad
people
who
wish
the
country
harm,
and
the
same
act
performed
by
that
person
is
made
more
serious
than
one
that
is
performed
by
some
other
person.
