general
doyle,
going
back
to
this
line
of
inquiry
and
looking
back
at
the
days
of
the
vietnam
conflict,
do
you
suppose
it
would
have
been
all
right
then
for
the
state
to
enhance
the
penalty
for
draft
card
burning
if
it's
done
because
of
opposition
to
government
policies,
for
example?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
see
how
that's
very
different
from
what
you
have
here
necessarily.
justice
sandra

o'connor
i
mean,
we
want
to
suppress
the
notion
of
racial
bias.
