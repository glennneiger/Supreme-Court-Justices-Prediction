mr.
adelman,
can
i
question
that
for
a
moment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
criminal
planning
the
crime
thinks
that
white
people
are
not
as
well
able
to
defend
themselves
as
people
of
other
races
and
for
that
reason
they
are
sort
of
easy
victims,
and
therefore
makes
a
practice
of
always
selecting
white
victims
and
makes
that
clear.
and
say
the
defendant
is
himself
white
and
therefore
has
no
bias
against
whites.
would
he
not
violate
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
selects
his
victim
because
of
his
race.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
part
of
the
burden
of
proof
of
the
state
is
to
show
an
animus
towards
the
race
of
the
victim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
arguing
that
biased
thought
is
an
element
of
the
offense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
clear
in
this
case
that
that
element
was
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
you
think
also
the
record
really
does
show
that
this
defendant
had
this
kind
of
bias
against
whites?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seemed
to
me,
very
frankly,
that
if
you
thought
that
was
an
element
of
the
offense
you
might
well
have
argued
a
failure
of
proof.
