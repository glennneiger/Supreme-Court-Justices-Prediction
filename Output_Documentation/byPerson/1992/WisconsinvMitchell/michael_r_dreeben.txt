mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
wisconsin's
sentence
enhancement
provision
is
valid
under
two
lines
of
this
court's
cases.
first,
government
may
combat
discrimination
in
crime
just
as
it
combats
discrimination
in
other
contexts
by
punishing
the
conduct
that
is
motivated
by
the
race,
religion,
or
other
status
of
the
victim.
it
is
settled
that
such
anti-discrimination
provisions
do
not
infringe
first
amendment
rights.
secondly--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
justice
scalia.
what's
being
punished
by
a
race-motivated
crime
or
a
crime
that's
motivated
by
the
status
of
the
victim
are
the
particular
harms
that
flow
to
victims
as
a
result
of
that
kind
of
crime.
race-motivated
crimes
this
court
has
recognized
is
degrading
to
the
victim,
it
tends
to
intimidate
the
victim
in
the
victim's
exercise
of
his
civic
and
civil
rights,
and
it
touches
all
other
members
of
the
class
to
which
the
victim
belongs
and
intimidates
those
members
of
the
class
in
the
exercise
of
their
rights.
and
it
is
those
additional
harms
that
are
inflicted
by
status-based
crime
that
justify
the
legislature,
as
wisconsin
has
done
and
as
the
federal
government
has
done,
in
targeting
that
kind
of
crime
for
increased
sanction
and
increased
deterrence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
exactly
right,
justice
kennedy.
and
i
think
that
the
key
inquiry
that
the
court
has
to
make
when
confronted
with
a
law
like
this
and
there's
an
allegation
that
the
state
is
in
some
sense
punishing
motive
or
thought
is
whether
the
law
is
justified
by
reasons
that
relate
to
free
expression
and
free
thought
or
whether
it's
justified
by
purposes
that
the
state
does
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
suppressing,
wholly
apart
from
punishing
belief.
and
the
court
has
made
that
inquiry
in
many
different
contexts
whenever
it
confronts
a
law
that
regulates
on
its
face
conduct
and
there's
a
claim
that
there's
some
sort
of
expressive
component
underlying
it.
the
inquiry
has
to
be
made
by
looking
at
the
text,
the
history,
the
application
of
the
law
by
the
state,
and
the
interests
that
are
asserted
by
the
state.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
those--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
those
are--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
i
think
the
entire
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
in
this
area
is
that
if
the
interest
of
the
government
is
to
regulate
conduct,
regulate
thought
and
speech
per
se
for
its
own
sake,
then
that
is
not
a
legitimate
interest.
that's
exactly
what
the
court
was
speaking
of
in
dawson
v.
delaware
when
it
held
that
the
government
may
not
punish
in
the
abstract
the
holding
of
a
particular
belief
or
the
holding
of
a
particular
idea.
what
it
may
do
is
address
the
harms
that
flow
from
the
conduct
that
is
bound
up
with
status-motivated
crime.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
acknowledge
that
if
the
court
determined
that
the
law's
purpose
and
effect
is
really
to
get
at
thought
and
not
to
get
at
the
conduct
that
is
manifesting
the
harms
in
question,
then
you
have
a
different
case.
and
that
is
exactly
the
kind
of
inquiry
that
the
court
undertook
in
the
barnes
v.
glen
theatre
case
to
determine
whether
a
law
against
public
nudity
was
really
aimed
at
expression.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
would
agree
with
that.
that's
entirely
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
deal
with.
the
kind
of
problems
that
flow
from
conduct
like
that
are
objective
and
they
relate
to
the
protection
of
citizens,
and
this
law
very
clearly
relates
to
the
protection
of
citizens.
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
in
this
country
there
is
a
genuine
problem
with
status-motivated
crime
that
affects
the
injuries
to
victims
and
the
intimidation
in
the
exercise
of
rights
that
federal
law
has
long
reached
out
in
an
attempt
to
regulate.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
the
particular
area
that
this
law
deals
with
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
additional
scrutiny
because
the
nation
has
experienced
such
problems
in
this
area
that
it
cannot
be,
there
can
be
no
doubt
whatsoever
that
the
state's
motivation
in
enacting
such
a
law
is
real
and
legitimate.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think
of
all
the
categories
that
are
in
the
list
the
category
of
disability
is
one
that
is
most
easy
to
understand,
that
the
disabled
status
of
a
victim
may
make
that
victim
more
vulnerable
to
crime
and
the
state
clearly
has
a
heightened
interest
in
protecting
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
know
that
there
is
any
evidence
in
this
record.
there
is
clearly
evidence
in
federal
policy
reflected
in
the
anti-discrimination
laws.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
may
be
evidenced
in
a
particular
case
that
there
is
no
real-life
problem
that
the
state
is
attempting
to
regulate,
that
the
state
has
some
other
goal
in
mind.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
suggestion
in
this
case
that
wisconsin
added
disability
to
the
list
of
prohibited
status-based
crimes
in
order
to
suppress
views
about
disability.
but
it
would
be
a
relevant
inquiry
for
the
court
to
make
when
confronted
with
a
law
that
reached
beyond
these
very
core
problems
that
have
affected
our
society
and
dealt
with
something
more
remote
like
opposition
to
government
policy
or
opposition
to
war
or
views
on
the
flat
earth
issue.
those
things
would
raise
greater
questions
just
on
the
face
of
the
statute
about
whether
the
state
had
in
mind
the
regulation
of
thought
or
speech
as
opposed
to
the
goals
that
we
say
are
furthered
by
this
law.
the
theory
of
the
wisconsin
supreme
court
that
simply
because
the
underlying
crime
is
already
punished
the
enhancement
must
be
directed
at
thought
is
a
theory
that
if
accepted
is
broad
enough
to
invalidate
this
nation's
anti-discrimination
laws.
all
of
the
federal
laws
that
deal
with
anti-discrimination
look
to
the
motive
of
the
actor
in
assessing
whether
the
conduct
is
in
fact
the
sort
of
discrimination
that's
meant
to
be
prohibited.
this
court
noted
that
as
recently
as
yesterday's
opinion
in
the
hazen
paper
company
case,
that
it
is
the
motive
of
the
actor
that
is
the
focus
of
the
law
and
without
an
impermissible
motive
the
conduct
in
question
is
not
regulated.
but
the
court
has
also
recognized
in
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
those
laws
that
simply
because
motive
is
an
element
does
not
mean
that
it
is
government's
goal
to
target
thought
for
its
own
sake.
what
government
has
done
in
these
laws
is
attempt
to
reach
the
evils
that
occur
as
a
result
of
discrimination.
and
in
the
context
of
race-motivated
crime
i
think
those
evils
are
very
apparent,
very
worthwhile
for
government
to
take
efforts
to
suppress,
and
there
is
no
indication
whatsoever
that
the
underlying
goal
here
of
the
wisconsin
legislature
is
somehow
to
punish
speech
or
thought
for
itself.
unlike
the
law
that
this
court
had
before
it
in
r.a.v.,
wisconsin
is
not
regulating
speech
in
any
form
or
expressing
disapproval
of
disfavored
ideas
for
its
own
sake.
the
citizens
of
wisconsin
are
entirely
free
to
hold
bigoted
beliefs
and
to
express
bigoted
ideas.
what
they
may
not
do
under
the
mantle
of
the
first
amendment
is
to
claim
immunity
for
the
added
harms
inflicted
by
their
status-based
crimes.
thank
you.
