anthony
m.
kennedy
you,
in
other
words
you're
saying
that
their
comments
were
directed
to
the
first
amendment
consequences
of
this
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
that's
on
page
a8
and
a9
of
the
appendix.
the
discussion
of
the
model
statute
is
right
after
the
comment
that
justice
scalia
has
in
mind,
i
think,
because
the
state
court
does
say
without
doubt
the
hate
crime
statute
punishes
bigoted
thought.
and
the
state
asserts
the
statute
punishes
only
conduct.
we
disagree.
that
does
sound
like
a
state
law
conclusion
that's
binding
on
us.
it's
certainly
questionable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
you
make
no
distinction
between,
or
do
you,
a
statute
which
simply
enhances
a
sentence
for
this
kind
of
conduct
and
a
hypothetical
statute
say
in
another
state
which
makes
this
a
substantive
crime
of,
in
a
free-standing
statute.
i
take
it
there
would
be
no
difference,
or
would
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
a
question
of
proximity,
how
proximate
is
the
conduct
to
the
thought?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
what
we
have
is
a
crime
that
itself
presents
a
substantive
evil
that
the
state
can
prevent
quite
without
regard
to
the
thoughts
and
beliefs
of
the
actor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
a
state
is
concerned
that
a
wave
of
intolerance
is
causing
injury
it
can
act
both
because
it
disapproves
of
that
intolerance
and
of
the
injury.
i
take
it
a
state,
if
there
were
a
rash
of
burnings
and
defacement
of
churches,
could
pass
a
statute
making
it
a
crime
to
burn
or
deface
a
church.
or
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
he
was
punished
because,
not
because
of
his
bias
but
because
his
bias
led
him
to
pick
out
a
victim
because
of
the
victim's
race.
there
are
many
forms
of
thought
that
are
not
punishable
but
that
become
punishable
when
translated
into
action.
it
seems
to
me
that's
all
that
happened
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
have
just
indicated
that
there
are
many
sorts
of
thoughts
that
you
have
that
are
protected
as
such
but
that
cannot
be
put
into
action,
and
i
don't
see
how
this
case
is
really
a
very
remarkable
deviation
from
that
simple
proposition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
want
us
to
pretend
that
the
anti-discrimination
clause
that
protects
minorities
in
employment
is
not
motivated
at
least
in
substantial
part
by
our
concern
with
racial
intolerance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
perhaps
i'm
wrong,
counsel.
on
a8
again
of
the
appendix
it
is
true
that
the
state
court
say
without
doubt
the
hate
crime
statute
punishes
bigoted
thought,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
isn't
all
it
punishes.
it
punishes
selection
of
a
victim
by
reason
of
the
victim's
race.
that's
all
the
statute
says.
and
i
don't
think
this
is
necessarily
inconsistent
with
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
that's
simply
because
it's
mostly
bigots
who
select
people
because
of
their
race.
that's
just
the
way
it
happens
to
be,
but
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
incidently,
the
wisconsin
court
hasn't
said
that
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
substantial
factor,
does
it?
this
just
hasn't
been
interpreted.
this
is
a
statute
that
was
amended
after
this
case
came
up.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
this
issue
is
something
not
before
us.
