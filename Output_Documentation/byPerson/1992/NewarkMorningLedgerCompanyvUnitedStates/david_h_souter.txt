under

some
may
be
capitalized,
may
they
not
be?
aren't
there
regs
under
173
that
allow
some
capitalization?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
true
that...
leaving
aside
the
question
of
fixed-term
contracts
that
you've
just
been
addressing,
is
it
true
that
in
principle,
if
it
is
possible
to
predict
an
average
definite
life
for
your
subscriber
base
which
is
in
issue
here,
that
in
principle
the
same
thing
could
be
done
with
respect
to
your
basis
in
newsstand
sales,
and
the
same
thing
could
be
done
with
respect
to
the
value
of
your
advertising
base?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
because
there
was
just
not
a
fact
base
upon
which
the
expert
could
testify,
or
because
there
was
something
in
principle
that
made
it
impossible
to
develop
that
fact
base?
for
example,
couldn't
people
have
gone
out
and
surveyed
the
people
buying
papers
at
the
newsstand
and
found,
based
on
their
answers,
that,
you
know,
most
of
them
buy
the
paper
5
days
a
week
and
have
done
so
for
the
last
20
years,
or
whatever
the
case
may
be,
and
if
you
got
a
sufficient
factual
base,
couldn't
the
same
kind
of
prediction
be
made?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
might
well
be
wholly
consistent
with
the
code,
but
the
effect
of
it
when
you
were
all
done
would
be
that
there
would
be
little
or
nothing
left
of
what
we
speak
of
as
goodwill,
and
that
may
be
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
bork,
may
i
ask
you
how
your
expert
dealt
with
this
distinction
between
the
classic
case
of
the
machine
with
the
10-year
life
and
the
subscriber
base
that
you're
talking
about?
in
the
machine
with
the
10-year
life,
we
assume
it's
got
a
10-year
life
because
we
assume
that
people
will
do
simple
ministerial
things
like
oiling
the
machine
and
feeding
it
with
whatever
it
takes
to
keep
it
going.
in
the
case
of
a
subscriber
base
for
a
paper,
however,
the
variables
are
a
lot
more
subtle,
because
they
include,
among
other
things,
the
kind
of
editorial
behavior
of
the
paper.
i
mean,
if
they
make
a
guess
about
how
racy
the
ads
may
be
and
still
keep
subscribers,
that's
going
to
cost
money.
if
they
change
from
a
clinton
position
to
a
perot
position,
that
may
cost
them
subscribers.
how
does
the
expert
deal
with
all
of
these,
i
would
suppose
potentially
unpredictable
value
choices
that
the
owner
of
the
paper
may
make
in
making
the
prediction
about
how
long
the
asset
will
survive?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
there's
still
a
market
for
printing
presses,
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
you
can't
say
that
there
is
a
market
for
subscriber
bases
as
opposed,
perhaps,
to
subscriber
lists
in
a
given
community.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
then
they're
just
buying
names.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you're
depreciating
more
than
just
names.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
i--
--mr.
wallace,
are
you
saying
in
essence
that
the
fallacy
in
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
assuming
that
the
value
comes
from
the
probability
of
certain
people
returning
as
opposed
to
the
probability
of
certain
people
buying,
and
that
if
in
fact
the
real
value
here
is
a
probability
of
buying,
which
may
or
may
not
coincide
to
some
degree
with
returning,
then
their
whole
analysis
falls?
is
that
fair?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
then
why
didn't
the...
and
perhaps
the
government
did,
but
did
the
government
oppose,
then,
the
relevance
of
the
expert
testimony,
or
perhaps,
indeed,
even
the
foundation
for
the
expert
testimony,
about
there
being
a
probable...
i
was
going
to
say
life
expectancy
to
the
asset.
why
didn't
the
government
say
the
expert's
testimony
is
entirely
irrelevant
because
we're
dealing
with
something,
i.e.,
the
probability
of
customers
coming,
which
does
not
have
a
clearly
determinable
period?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
the
proper
definition
of
the
asset
is
given
in
terms
of
the
probability
of
customers
buying,
as
opposed
to
the
probability
of
customers
returning,
or
indeed,
having
to
return,
then
you
would
not
make
that
concession,
would
you?
you
would
not
concede
that
the
existence
of
the
contract
should
make
any
difference.
that's
just
one
incidental
reason
for
which
they
might
buy,
and
others
will
buy
for
other
reasons.
