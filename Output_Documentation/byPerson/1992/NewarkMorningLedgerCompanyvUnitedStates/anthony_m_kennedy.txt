suppose
that
no
new
investment
is
required
to
solicit
new
subscribers.
i
don't
think
that's
the
fact,
but
a
hypothetical
case.
would
the
case
be
any
different
if
the
new
subscribers
just
automatically
came
without
any
promotion
or
subscription
drives?
would
your
case
be
just
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
hypothetical
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
i
recognize
the
finding
isn't
challenged.
i
just
find
it
hard
to
grasp
the
case
because
our
common
knowledge
tells
us
that
many
businesses
will
have
renewed
patronage
just
because
of
their
reputation
and
the
quality
of
their
product.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
why
is
it
that
you
can
define
the
asset
in
the
way
you
choose,
just
because
a
portion
of
the
asset
has
a
useful
life,
i.e.,
the
current
subscribers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
purchase
a
business,
one
of
the
things
you
purchase
is
goodwill
in
the
sense
of...
the
classic
sense
of
renewed
patronage--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
simply
because
a
statistician
can
take
out
of
the
continuous
patronage
pool
the
existing
subscribers,
i
don't
know
why
that
makes
it
a
separate
asset.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
have
trouble
with
that,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
knew
the
newspaper
was
going
to
last
for
only
20
years
you
might
have
paid
less
than
67
million
dollars.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
the
government's
position--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
view...
and
this
came
from
your
reference
to
the
tax
court
cases...
that
neither
the
government
nor
the
tax
court
has
any
definition
of
goodwill,
other
than
residual
value?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
government
simply
must
resort
to
the
idea
that
continued
patronage
is
the
essence
of
goodwill
as
an
ipse
dixit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
just
isn't
any
depreciation.
if
you
call
it
an
asset,
it
isn't
depreciating--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because
it's
constantly
renewing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
the
phrase
is
wrong?
so
that
it
should
be
that
new
customers
will
come
to
the
old
place?
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
the
mistake
of
the
taxpayer
here
trying
to
make
divisible
what's
really
a
single
asset?
is
that
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
is
a
finding
of
the
district
court
that
the
customer
base
is
not
self-renewing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
know
about
the
behavior
of
these
newspaper
subscribers,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
the
experts
said
that
they
could
value
this
and
that
these
people
would
not
be
subscribers
after
more
than...
well,
14
to
21
years.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
means
that
we,
if
you're
going
to
prevail
in
this
case,
have
to
define
goodwill
in
a
way
other
than
the
residual
value
which
you
yourself
set
out
at
page
3
in
your
brief.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
want
us
to
say
that
the
essence
of
goodwill
is
renewed
patronage,
and
make
that
a
rule
of
law,
and
there's
obviously
some
common
sense
appeal
to
that,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
it
seems
to
me
it
is
not
consistent
with
the
residual
definition
that
you
yourself
embraced
in
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
say
we
have
to
define
going-concern
value?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is
the
definition
of
goodwill
that
you
want
us
to
apply,
other
than
the
residual
method
of
determining?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
essence
of
goodwill
and
may
not
be
depreciated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
hypothetical
regarding
the
fast-food
chain
across
from
the
college,
if
it
had
been
announced
that
the
college
was
closing
in
4
years,
i
take
it
an
accountant
would
be
required
to
depreciate
the
so-called
goodwill,
or
the
customer
list,
over
4
years.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
might
have
paid
for
4
years
of
revenue,
and
if
it's
measurable,
it
can
be
depreciated.
