mr.
bork,
i
didn't
understand
the
government's
argument
to
be
that
these
regenerate
themselves.
rather,
i
thought
their
argument
was
they
really
don't
regenerate
themselves.
you
have
to
make
expenditures
to
retain
your
subscribership,
but
the
government
does
not
require
those
expenditures
to
be
capitalized
because
those
expenditures
are
not
going
towards
maintenance
of
a
capital
asset,
and
it's
consistent
with
that
not
to
allow
you
a
depreciation
on
that
so-called
asset.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
in
other
businesses
that
have
similar
arrangements
they
would
have
to
be
capitalized?
justice
antonin
scalia
may
i
ask
you
a
different...
no,
go
ahead.
before
we
get
off
that,
but
what...
isn't
it
the
case
that
the
maintenance
that
is
put
into
this
is
precisely
the
kind
of
maintenance
you're
talking
about?
it's
the
kind
of
maintenance
that
is
designed
to
make
it
last
forever.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
designed
to
make
it
last
not
just
5
years,
whatever
the
normal
period
would
be,
but
as
long
as
the
newspaper
is
in
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bork,
does
something
which
does
not
have
a
determinable
life
acquire
a
determinable
life
simply
by
being
aggregated
with
other
items
that
do
not
have
a
determinable
life
and
subjected
to
statistical
probability?
i
mean,
the
fixed
contracts
you
gave
as
a
hypothetical
before,
if
you
had
fixed
contracts
with
subscribers,
each
one
of
them
would
have
individually
a
determinable
life...
5
years,
2
years,
1
year.
each
of
these
subscriptions
that
we're
arguing
about
today
do
not
have
any
determinable...
if
you
had
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
one
individual
subscriber,
what
the
determinable
life
was,
you'd
have
to
say,
gee,
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
sample.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
for
the
rest,
you're
making
a
statistical
generalization.
you
don't...
you
couldn't
really
point
to
an
individual
subscriber
and
say,
the
life
of
this
subscriber
is,
except
for
the
few
that
you
did
in
the
sample.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
really
only
that?
i
mean,
isn't...
if
a
newspaper
goes
out
of
business
and
does
not
sell
its
business
to
anyone
else,
certainly
somebody
out
of
the
blue
can't
come
up
the
next
day
and
begin
delivering
me
newspapers,
and
then
bill
me
for
those
papers.
isn't
what
they
were
selling
the
right
to
deliver
papers
with
the
expectation
of
being
paid
for
those
papers
unless
and
until
the
recipient
says,
deliver
them
no
more?
isn't
that
a
contractual
right,
something
beyond
mere
goodwill?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
just
a
relationship
with
customers,
it
seems
to
me.
you
have
a
relationship
with
customers
who
buy
off
the
newsstands,
but
you
have
a
contractual
right
with
respect
to
these
subscriber
customers.
you
have
a
contractual
right
to
drop
a
newspaper
on
their
doorstep
and
receive
a
payment
for
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--unless
and
until
they
cancel
the
subscription.
that's
a
contractual
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
you
have
thousands
of
such
contracts
and
you
can
show
statistically
that
a
certain
percentage
of
those
thousands
will
invariably
be
renewed?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it's
a
lease
that
continues
from
year
to
year
unless
affirmatively
cancelled?
let's
assume
it's
a
year-to-year
lease.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
objection
is
not
to
the
valuation
rather
than
in
principle
to
the
depreciability.
suppose
it
could
be
established
that
had...
you're
in
a
town
with
one
newspaper,
and
it
could
be
established
that
if
that
newspaper
just
folded
up
and
a
new
newspaper
opened
up
the
next
day,
it
would
acquire
almost...
it
would
acquire
95
percent
of
the
people
who
had
subscribed
to
the
previous
newspaper,
but
it
would
not
acquire
the
last
5
percent.
would
not
the
value
of
the
subscription
list
be
a
reality?
wouldn't
it
be
worth
5
percent
of
the
subscriptions?
you're
saying
that
this
contractual
relationship
had
zero
value.
it
seems
to
me
it
has
some
value,
although
it
may
not
be
the
value
of
100
percent
of
the
subscribers
of
the
newspaper.
you
might
get
95
percent
of
them,
even
if
you
didn't
have
the
right
to
drop
your
newspaper
on
their
porch
the
next
day
and
get
paid
for
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
can
show
that
those
5
percent
of
subscribers
that
i
would
not
have
gotten
if
i
had
not
had
the
right
to
drop
the
newspaper
on
their
stand,
they're
just
lazy.
they
would
not
have
subscribed
on
their
own.
they're
maybe
elderly,
and
they
wouldn't
take
the
trouble
to
do
it
any
more,
but
if
they
had
the
subscription
they'd
continue
to
pay
for
it.
i
can
show
that
that
5
percent
i
would
not
have
had,
and
that
that
5
percent
will
be
gone
in
3
years.
i
don't
know
why
i
shouldn't
be
able
to
depreciate
that.
it's
a
contractual
value
that
i
acquired
from
the
outgoing
newspaper.
