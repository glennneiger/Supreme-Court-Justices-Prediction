justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
keeps
troubling
me,
mr.
bork?
you
start
out
with
460,000
paid
subscribers
and
then
in
a
period
of
years...
what
is,
5
years?
whatever
period...
there
will
be
a
turnover,
and
you
assume
those
460,000
have
been
replaced
by
another
460,000,
so
the
original
460,000
is
a
wasted
asset
and
the
others
are
brand-new.
but
say
you
had
exactly
the
same
situation
with
your
newsstand
circulation.
you
had
460,000
people
on
your
paid
circulation
from
newsstands,
and
you
could
statistically
find
out
that
there's
a
turnover
in
3
years
of
those.
why
can't
you...
why
wouldn't
your
theory
require
also
treating
the
people
who
were
there
at
one
time
and
had
been
replaced
by
others
as
a
wasting
asset
in
that
branch
of
the
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
it
would,
wouldn't
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--not
just
could?
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
you
have
the
accounting
technique
to
prove
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
only
match
costs
when
you
sell
a
business.
it
wouldn't
match
it
in
an
ongoing
business,
because
you'd
expense
the
costs
of
developing
those
sales--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as
either
the
paid
subscribers
or
the
newsstand
sales
are
expensed,
as
you
develop
them.
it's
only
when
you
sell
to
a
new
buyer
who
will
pay
a
premium
for
it,
and
then
your
premium
is
really
what
you're
going
to
amortize.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
would
suppose
in
future
purchase
transactions
they
would
always
negotiate
an
allocation
for
these
various
items
and
have
some
basis,
and
then
try
and
defend
it
later
with
expert
testimony
as
to
what...
you
know,
capitalizing
it
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
if
they'd
bought
assets
instead
of
stock,
they
would
have
had
to
make
an
allocation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
it
does
seem
to
me
that
your
position...
it
may
well
be
right.
i'm
not...
that
doesn't
go
to
that,
but
your
position
it
seems
to
me
will,
in
time,
given
the
techniques
that
are
available
now
for
computing
all
sorts
of
things,
would
mean
that
goodwill
would
seldom
be...
there
would
seldom
be
any
goodwill
left
in
the
sale
of
the
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
in
this
case
if
you'd
had
the...
because
you're
pushing
a
little
bit.
if
you
wanted
to
push
your
theory
all
the
way,
you
could
really
have
capitalized
your
newsstand
sales
and
your
advertising
relationships,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
--that's
the
next
case.
only
a
small
amount
of
goodwill...
relatively
small
amount
of
goodwill
was
left
over
in
this
transaction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
state
the
question
just
a
little
differently
that
troubles
me,
and
i'm...
as
i'm
really
not
sure
of
the
answer
at
all,
but
you
describe
the
wasting
asset
as
the
relationship
between
the
newspaper
and
the
existing
subscribers,
so
that
even
though
you
have
460
subscribers
today,
and
460
different
subscribers
5
years
later,
you
still
say
that's
a
wasted
asset.
i
think
normally
when
one
buys
a
business,
you
say
you
get
the
same
number
of
customers
5
years
later,
it's
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
perceive
that
as
a
wasting
asset--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--whether
it's
newsstand
or
subscriptions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
you
wouldn't,
but
you
would
have
capitalized
that.
you
would
have
capitalized
that
machine
when
you
bought
it,
and
it's
rather
strange
that
you
have
a
wasting
asset
when
you
buy
a
business,
but
you
don't
when
you
just
continue
to
operate
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
question
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
in
your
dialogue
earlier
with
justice
scalia.
we
were
talking
about
contractually
based
relationships,
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
court
seemed
to
assume
that
you
had
agreed
that
if
these
relationships
were
contractually
based,
that
then
they
would
be
depreciable
assets,
and
then
the
question
is,
why
doesn't
that
concession
undermine
your
hypothetical
examples
and
all
the
rest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was,
the
service
does
not
dispute
that
the
value
of
the
paid
subscribers
would
constitute...
would
not
constitute
goodwill
if
morning
ledger's
expectation
of
continued
patronage
were
contractually
based.
now,
is
that
an
incorrect
statement
of...
they
say
you
didn't
dispute
it.
