chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
91-1135,
the
newark
morning
ledger
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
bork.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
more
intensively
you
study
each
situation,
the
less
total
goodwill
you
would
end
up
with
under
your
theory.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
the
tax
court
is
entitled
to
deference
in
a
way
that
the
commissioner
is
not
in
the
case
of
an
internal
revenue
matter?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
would
be
unusual
in
this
case,
which
came
up
not
through
the
tax
court
but
through
the
district
court,
to
say
that
some
other
decision
of
the
tax
court
is
entitled
to
some
special
deference.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
it
should
be
accepted
because
it's
sound
analysis.
i
presume
that's
true
of
any
decision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bork.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-1135,
newark
morning
ledger
company
versus
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
