but
you
wouldn't
know
what
the
base
was.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
would
capitalize
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
figure
would
you
be
depreciating?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
you
would
value
this
asset
that
you're
talking
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
say
this
is
a
depreciable
asset,
how
much
are
you
going
to
depreciate
each
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
have
to
have
something
to
subtract
from.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
what
do
you
do,
capitalize
the
expenses?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
you
didn't...
this
sale
didn't
negotiate
the
value
of
the
customer
lists.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
allocated...
the
company
allocated
what
it
thought
was
a
fair
allocation.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
forbidden
to
capitalize
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
you
may...
you
may
expense
it,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
which
event,
if
you
do,
you
don't
capitalize
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
think
it
forbids
you
to
capitalize.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you'd
rather
expense
it
than
capitalize
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it
was
a
wasting
asset...
became
a
wasting
asset.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
bork,
i
take
it
you
would
be
perfectly
willing
to
win
this
case
on
the
basis
that
it's
limited
to
a
situation
where
you
buy
a
customer
list.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
would
be
glad
to
limit
this
case
to
where
you
do
buy
whatever
it
is
you
call
it,
a
customer
list,
or
seasoned
customers,
where
you
actually
pay
money
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
that's
what
you
did,
but
i
take
it
your
argument
would
be
that
even
where
you
are
not
buying
a
company,
you
just
have
an
on-going
business
with
seasoned
customers,
that
your
theory
could
apply
to
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
would
be
a
newspaper.
that's
because
of
the
provision--
justice
byron
r.
white
--suppose
you
bought
assets,
and
you
actually
negotiated
a
figure
for
the
customer
list,
as
you
call
it.
i
suppose
there
would
be
no
question
that
you
could
depreciate
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
wallace,
i
thought
the
68
million
dollars
was
the
value
to
the
paper
of
just
the
existing
seasoned
customers,
whether
or
not
they
over
got
any
subscribers
at
all
to
replace
them.
they
just...
what
value
is
it
to
sell
papers
to
this
particular
group
of
400,000
plus
subscribers?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
from
those
400,000
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
nevertheless
measured
its
value
by
the
expected
income
from
these
400,000
subscribers,
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
can
say
if
you
can
give
a
value
to
goodwill
it
must
be
because
they're
going
to
have
just...
they
expect
to
keep
the
same
number
of
customers
or
more
over
the
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
which
event,
there's
no
depreciation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
that
your
position
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the...
your
opposition
suggests
that
the
government
changed
its
position
between
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
