mr.
bork,
i
had
thought
maybe
your
theory
could
be
applied
just
to
the
situation
where
the
subscriber
has
to
take
an
affirmative
act
to
stop
the
subscription,
the
kinds
of
lists
where
there's
an
inertia
factor,
if
you
will,
rather
than...
is
that
important,
do
you
think,
in
making
it
possible
to
make
a
statistical
analysis
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
inertia
factor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
why
it's
a
little
closer
to
a
fixed
contract?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
regulation,
that
last
sentence
saying
you
can't
depreciate
goodwill,
is
consistent
with
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
mr.
bork,
do
you
think
that
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
is
entitled
to
some
deference
here
in
saying
we're
not
going
to
treat
this
like
an
annuity,
we're
going
to
treat
it
like
a
nonwasting
asset?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
wallace,
isn't
it
possible
to
say
that
when
proof
and
findings
such
as
were
made
here,
then
it
takes
it
out
of
the
definition
of
goodwill
and
puts
it
squarely
within
the
meaning
of
a
statute
as
a
wasting
asset?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
argument
you
need
to
address.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
was
that
a
finding
here
in
the
district
court
that
it
was?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
wallace,
it
seems
to
me
that
none
of
those
examples
involve
the
kind
of
thing
we
have
here,
which
is
a
contractual
arrangement
to
have
a
newspaper
delivered
at
the
door
unless
and
until
the
customer
says
i
don't
want
it
any
more,
or
a
relationship
that
you
might
have
as
a
depositor
in
a
bank...
i
want
you
to
keep
my
assets
until
i
terminate
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
none
of
your
examples
have
dealt
with
that
kind
of
situation,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
able
to
be
analyzed
for
its
expected
life
in
a
different
way
than
in
the
examples
you
pose.
