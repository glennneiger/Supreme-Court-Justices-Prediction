mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
newark
morning
ledger
is
here
seeking
a
reversal
of
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
which
denied
a
depreciation
deduction
on
the
ledger's
tax
returns.
now,
the
ledger
paid
68
million
dollars
for
the
subscriber
relationships
of
those
eight
papers
when
it
acquired
them,
and
there
were...
these
were
enormously
valuable,
460,000
subscribers,
because
of
the
subscription
income
they
produced.
now,
these
assets,
the
subscriber
relationships,
are
wasting
assets
because
they
have
limited
lives,
and
for
that
reason
ledger
seeks
to
depreciate
them.
there
is
no
question
here
that
ledger
proved
the
lives
of
these
particular
subscriber
relationships
and
proved
their
value.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
don't...
it
might
not
be
just
the
same,
your
honor,
but
in
fact
you're
addressing
the
government's
argument
that
these
are
self-regenerating
assets,
that
they
just
continue,
we'll
have...
no
matter
what
we
do,
we'll
always
have
460,000
subscribers.
the
district
court
found
as
fact
that
these
are
not
self-regenerating
assets,
and
that
factual
finding
was
not
disturbed
by
the
third
circuit,
so
i
think
it
is...
that's
a
question--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--if
we
did
nothing
and
got
no
new
subscribers,
is
that
the
question?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
we
would
have
a
wasting
assets.
we
would
have
what
we...
the
paper
would
be
gone
at
the
end
of
the
subscriber
relationships.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
suppose
there
would
be
some
renewed
patronage
in
that
way,
but
the
fact
is
that
all
newspapers,
particularly
in
this
era
of
declining
readership,
but
all
newspapers,
including
newark
morning
ledger,
spends
a
great
deal
of
money
and
effort
trying
to
get
new
subscribers
to
replace
the
ones
that
disappear,
so
they
just
don't
automatically...
new
subscribers
just
don't
automatically
appear,
and
the
district
court
so
found
they
do
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
those
expenditures
would
have
to
be
capitalized
but
for
section
173
of
the
code,
which
makes
a
special
case
for
newspapers,
and
it's--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--you
mean
if
they
are
getting
new...
if...
take
in
the
case
of
a
machine,
suppose
this
were
a
printing
press
we're
talking
about.
we
have
to...
you'd
have
to
have
maintenance
on
the
machine.
suppose
it
has
a
10-year
life,
you
would
amortize
the
cost
over
10
years,
but
you
would
also
have
maintenance
on
the
machine
to
make
it
last
10
years,
and
that
would
be
expensed.
however,
if
you
put...
if
you
did
things
to
the
machine
to
make
it
last
15
years
instead
of
10,
the
additional
time
would
have
to
be
capitalized,
but
the
maintenance
of
the
machine
is
not.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
wasn't
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
it
seemed
to
me
that...
i
know
that
we
take
them
as
expenses,
the
cost
of
maintaining
and
acquiring
new...
old
subscribers
and
acquiring
new
subscribers.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
no.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
we're
talking
about
individual
subscriber
relationships
which
have
been
valued
here.
the
maintenance
that
is
put
in
to
maintain
existing
subscribers
is
to
maintain
them
for
the
limited
life
which
has
been
estimated,
not
to
extend
them
beyond
that.
the
cost
of
acquiring
new
subscribers
is
a
separate
asset
all
together.
the
new
subscriber
is
a
separate
asset.
for
example,
if
you
had...
one
of
the
more
illogical
contentions
in
this
case
by
the
third
circuit
and
by
the
government
is
that
we
could
depreciate
the
subscriber
relationships
if
they
were
in
fixed-term
contracts.
now,
i
hope
this
goes
to
the
question
we're
discussing.
assume
that
newark
morning
ledger
had
460,000
fixed-term
contracts
with
its
subscribers.
those,
the
government
will
admit,
could
be
capitalized
and
depreciated.
then,
newark
morning
ledger
begins
to
expend
moneys
and
effort
to
get
new
subscribers
under
fixed-term
contracts.
at
the
end
of
the
life
of
the
fixed-term
contracts
that
it
purchased,
when
they're
all
gone,
let's
assume
that
newark
morning
ledger
would
still
have
460,000
fixed-term
contracts
with
subscribers.
those
are
a
different
asset
all
together,
so
there's
no
question
of
a
double
deduction
or
anything
of
that
sort.
they
purchased
and
capitalized
the
existing
subscriber
relationships
as
they
tried
to
get
new
subscriber
relationships,
those
were
expensed
under
173...
different
assets
all
together.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
same
thing...
we
found
it
impossible
to
do
it
with
respect
to
either
newsstand
sales
or
advertising,
which
is
much
less...
fluctuates
much
more,
and
is
much
less
certain,
and
the
issue
here--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
yes...
allow
me
to
correct
something
i
just
said
before
i
answer
your
question,
mr.
justice
souter,
and
that
is
i
think
we
could
have
done
it
on
the
advertising.
it
would
be
must
less
certain.
on
the
newsstand
sales,
that...
maybe
if
you
did
an
intensive
study
and
it
turned
out
that
newsstand
purchasers
were
the
same
people,
maybe
you
could
do
such
a
thing.
however,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
in
fact,
that's
a
healthy
development,
because
then
you
would
know
that
they
had
limited
lives
and
that
you
would
have
a
wasting
asset,
and
you
would
depreciate
it,
which
fits
the
basic
premise
of
the
tax
code
of
matching
your
expenses
with
your
revenue
to
come
up
with
net
income,
so
if
it
were
possible
to
do
these
additional
things,
that
would
be
good
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
tax
code.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--that
would
vary
from
case
to
case.
these
are...
you
know,
these
are
fact-bound
cases,
and
there
would
be
cases
in
which
there
would
be
a
great
deal
of
goodwill
and
cases,
i
suppose...
there
are
cases
in
which
there
is
no
goodwill.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if,
by
new
statistical
techniques,
chief
justice,
and
computers
and
so
forth
and
the
things
that
are
developing,
and
new
accounting
techniques,
it
became
possible
to
give
determinable
lives
to
these
other
assets,
that's
right,
they
would
no
longer
be
goodwill,
because,
as
the
government
concedes,
and
has
conceded
in
its
regulations
and
in
its
revenue
rulings,
the
defining
characteristic
of
goodwill
is
that
it
does
not
have
a
determinable
life.
if
you
can
take
some
body
of
relationships
and
give
them
a
determinable
life,
they
are
not
goodwill,
and
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that,
because
what
that
does
is
give
you
a
more
perfect
match
between
the
cost
of
producing
the
income...
the
revenue,
in
order
to
get
the
net
income.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
your
honor,
we
did
that.
we
did
that.
we
did
individual
subscribers,
and
let
me
describe
the
process.
this
is
a
process
the
government
uses
in
its
cases,
too,
so
it's
not
a...
there's
nothing
unique
about
it.
we
took
samples
from
the
460,000
subscribers,
a
statistically
significant
sample...
and
there
was
no
objection
by
the
government
to
that
technique,
and
they
couldn't
because
they
use
it
themselves
in
other
cases...
took
samples
and
then
determined
what
percentage
of
subscribers
had
been
subscribers
from
zero
to
1
year,
1
to
2,
and
so
forth,
up
to
40
years,
and
then
over
40,
and
so
we
in
effect
had
through
the
sample
technique
a
determination
of
each
individual
subscriber's
life.
these
are
particular
subscribers.
this
is
not
one
big
lump
of
assets.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
that's
right,
but
the
sample
is
statistically
accurate.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
that's
true,
justice
scalia,
but
the
fact
is,
that's
the
way
these
cases
are
tried.
that's
the
way
the
government
does
these
things,
too,
and
if
the
sample
is
inadequate
so
that
it
doesn't
accurately
reflect
the
whole,
then
that
could
be
objected
to.
that
was
not
objected
to
here.
the
sample
was
fine.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
is
important,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--i
think
it
is
important.
that's
the
reason
that
distinguishes
these
subscriber
relationships
from
the
people
buying
at
newsstands.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
why
it
is
the
same
as
a
fixed
contract
under
the
regulation.
i
should
say
that
we
are
really
relying
upon
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
the
plain
language
of
the
regulation.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
yes.
the
statute
doesn't
even
mention
goodwill.
from
our
point
of
view,
it's
certainly
consistent
enough,
because
we
don't
want
to
depreciate
goodwill,
but
it's
quite
clear
from
the
face
of
the
regulation...
i
should
say
this
with
apologies.
we
misprinted
the
regulation
in
our
brief.
however,
none
of
the
relevant
language
was
misprinted,
and...
there
we
are.
but
none
of
the
relevant
language
is
misprinted.
but
the
regulation
says
that
an
intangible
asset
is
depreciable
when
it
is
known
from
experience
or
other
factors
that
its
life
is
limited
and
the
length
of
that
life
can
be
estimated
with
reasonable
accuracy.
now,
that
makes
an
at-will
contract
the
same
as
a
fixed-term
contract.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i'm
not--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--well--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--well,
it
is
quite
obviously...
we
paid
68
million
dollars
for
this
asset,
so
that
i
would
say
that
that's
a
separate
asset,
but--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--oh,
sure.
there
is
going
concern
value,
and
there
is
goodwill,
and
there
are
other
things,
but
this
is
a
defined
asset,
and
we
rely
here,
justice
kennedy,
on
the
regulation
and
the
government's
explanation
of
this
regulation.
you
see,
the
fact
is
that
this
regulation
we're
dealing
with
now
first
came
into
effect
in
a
slightly
different
form
in
1919,
not
in
1927,
as
the
government
says,
and
it
said
that
if
an
intangible
asset
is
known
from
experience
to
be
of
value
for
only
a
limited
period,
the
length
of
which
can
be
estimated
from
experience
with
reasonable
certainty,
such
intangible
asset
may
be
the
subject
of
a
depreciation
allowance,
and
i
think
this
becomes
important.
then
it
said,
there
can
be
no
such
allowance
in
respect
of
goodwill,
trade
names,
trademarks,
trade
brands,
secret
formulae,
or
processes.
now,
every
one
of
those
is
an
intangible
with
no
limited
life.
now,
when
prohibition
was
upon
us,
the
irs
thought
that
the
goodwill
of
a
brewery
or
a
distiller
had
a
limited
life,
because
prohibition
was
going
to
cut
the
business
off.
the
court
later
said
that
it
still
wasn't...
goodwill
still
couldn't
be
depreciated
because
it
didn't
fit
the
statute
in
terms
of
being
exhausted
or
worn
out,
it
was
cut
off
by
law.
but
the
irs,
when
it
allowed
for
the
time
being
the
depreciation
of
goodwill,
said
that
the
principle
of
depreciating
assets
whose...
depreciating
intangibles
whose
life
is
limited
overrides
the
statement
in
the
regulation
that
goodwill
is
not
depreciable.
the
rule
of
limited
life
requiring
depreciability
was
said
to
be
controlling.
now...
and
in
fact
the
current
revenue
regulation...
ruling
states
that
it
was
issued
to
remove
any
implication
that
customer
and
subscription
lists
are
as
a
matter
of
law
indistinguishable
from
goodwill.
it
further
states
that
the
depreciability
of
assets
of
this
nature
is
factual
issue,
so
what
we
have
here
is
a
continuing
course
of
a
code,
a
regulation
beginning
in
1919
and
up
to
date,
a
revenue
ruling
which
is
now
in
force,
all
of
which
contradict
the
government's
per
se
approach
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
suppose
it
could,
justice
stevens.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
i
suggest--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--yes,
but
i
think
that's--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--that's
right,
and
i
think
that's
my
point.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i'm
assuming...
i
think
justice
stevens
is
assuming--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--that
we
know
who
the...
who's
buying
papers
at
the
newsstand.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
figure
of
the
regular
newsstand
purchases.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
first
you'd
have
to
do
something
we
currently
can't
do.
first
you'd
have
to
study
it
and
find
out
what
the
lives
were
of
the
people
who
buy
at
newsstands.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
it
depends
on
the
life.
if
it's--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--oh,
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
you'd
capitalize
the
income
from
the
people
who
purchased...
the
present
value
of
the
income,
and
you'd
amortize
that,
but
we're
currently
unable
to
do
that.
but
my
point
is,
if
we
were
able
to
do
that,
that
would
be
good
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
tax
code,
not
bad,
because
it
would
match
costs
and
revenue
to
produce
net
income
more
accurately
than
we
can
now
do
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that's
right.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the
seller
when
he
sells
will
pay
the
tax
on
the
sale,
and
the
purchaser,
just
as
a
printing
press,
will
take
what
he
paid
for
it
and
use
it
as
the
basis
for
amortizing.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
you're
positing
a
case
where
perhaps
some
fraud
is
involved.
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
we
did
not
negotiate.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--yes.
it
had
accountants
and
statisticians,
and
i
might
say--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--yes,
true.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
none
of
that
was
challenged.
i
mean,
the--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--i
really
can't--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--well,
i
think
if
we
could
have,
justice
stevens,
we
would
have,
but
we
didn't.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
h.
bork
22
million.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
not,
justice
o'connor,
the
reason
being
that
the
commissioner's
position
has
been
all
over
the
lot
in
these
cases,
and
his
litigating
position
is
different
from
his
position
under
the
revenue
ruling
and
under
the
regulation,
so
i
don't
there's
any...
the
commissioner
is
entitled
to
any
deference
here.
in
fact,
i
think
if
deference
is
owed
here,
it
would
be
to
the
tax
court,
which
has
a
great
deal
of
expertise
in
this
field,
and
this
court,
as
i
believe,
has
from
time
to
time
recognized
some
deference
to
the
tax
court,
and
the
tax
court
uniformly
rules
our
way.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
the
commissioner...
no,
no.
i
say
the
commissioner
is
not
in
this
case,
chief
justice,
because
the
commissioner's
position
has
changed,
and
because
his
position
runs
contrary
to
the
regulation
and
the
revenue
ruling.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
before...
may
i
continue
to
answer
that
for
a
moment?
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
the
court...
in
the
district
court,
the
commissioner...
the
service
took
the
position
that
this
was
a
factual
issue,
just
the
position
we
took.
it
wasn't
until
they
lost
and
went
on
appeal
that
they
switched
to
a
statement
that
no,
this
is
goodwill
as
a
matter
of
metaphysics,
or
it's
the
essence
of
goodwill,
and
begin
to
argue
a
legal
position.
so
i
don't...
that's
an
additional
reason,
i
think,
why
deference
is
not
required,
since
they
took
an
inconsistent
position
in
the
district
court
with
the
one
they
took
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
one
they
take
here.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
it's
entitled
to
some
deference,
your
honor,
simply
because
they
analyzed
the
same
problem,
the
same
statute,
the
same
regulation,
and
arrived
at
the
result
that
if
you
can
give
a
wasting,
intangible
asset
a
determinable
life
with
reasonable
accuracy,
then
it
is
not
goodwill.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
that's
right.
well,
i
think
something
is
due
to
something...
if
you
don't
want
to
call
it
deference,
i
won't
call
it
deference,
but
some
persuasive
force,
i
think,
is...
should
be
accorded
to
the
tax
court
when
it
faces
these
things
and
has
a
good
deal
of
expertise
in
these
matters.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
justice
stevens--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--justice
stevens,
if
we
bought
a
machine,
a
printing
press,
and
it
had
a
10-year
life,
and
you
looked
at
the
end
of
the
10
years...
and
we
still
had
the
printing
press...
you
wouldn't
deny
depreciation
on
the
machine
we
bought,
because
we--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--you
don't,
because
of...
well,
for
a
couple
of
reasons,
one
if
it's
just
maintenance,
then
it's
expense
rather
than
capitalization,
and
the
other
is,
in
the
newspaper
business
section
173
says
that
the
cost
of
acquiring
new
subscribers
is
to
be
expensed
rather
than
capitalized.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
believe
so,
but
i'm
not...
i
don't
have
the--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--you
may...
i'm
not
sure
whether--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--oh,
if
you
do,
you
don't
capitalize
it,
no.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that,
i
must
confess,
i'm
not
entirely
sure
about.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
certainly
would,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
but
the
code
allows
it,
and
i
don't
think
we're...
i
don't
think
we're...
i
don't
think
we're
forced
to
say
the
code
is
wrong
about
what
we're
entitled
to
do.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
there
is
no
definition
of
goodwill
that's
agreed
upon
by
anybody.
the
statute...
the
code
does
not
mention
goodwill
in
the
wasting
asset
thing.
the
regulation
does
not
define
it.
i
think
if
you
read
the
regulation,
it's
clear...
the
regulation
breaks
in
two.
the
first
part
says,
a
wasting
asset
with
a
determinable
life
is
depreciable,
and
it
gives
examples.
then
it
says,
wasting
assets
with
a
life
that
can't
be
determined
is
not
depreciable,
and
it
says
goodwill.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
it
is
an
ipse
dixit.
i
don't
know
where
it
comes
from,
except
just
general
description
that
people...
but
they
use
different
descriptions.
but
the
fact
is,
there
is
a
simple
bright
line
test
in
the
regulation
which
says,
determinable
life,
depreciable,
nondeterminable
life,
nondepreciable.
the
government
throws
in
a
wild
card,
says,
but
ah,
there's
goodwill,
which
is
neither
of
those
two
things,
but
it
trumps
everything
else.
that
produces
chaos.
we
have
a
bright
line
test
which
the
government
is
trying
to
muddy
to
win
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
he
assumes
that
the
business
will
run
pretty
much
as
before,
but
let
me
say
to
you,
justice
souter,
i
think
that
same
argument
would
apply
to
the
printing
press.
if
a
paper
is
running
along
with
a
half-million
subscribers
and
makes
a
bad
guess
about
what
will
appeal
to
subscribers
so
that
it
loses
subscribers,
loses
half
of
them,
the
printing
press
is
less
valuable,
and
it--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--well--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--well,
there
is
a
difference
of
opinion
about
whether
there
is
a
separate
market
for
a
subscriber
base,
but
that's
because
people
do
purchase
a
paper
and
purchase
the...
pay
money
for
the
right
to
go
to
those
subscribers.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
names
and
information.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
i'm
saying,
as
to
a
machine,
a
printing
press
that
you
had
to
pull
out
of
a
plant
and
sell
on
the
open
market
would
not
be
nearly
worth
as
much
as
it
would
be
in
an
ongoing
newspaper,
so
that
you
have
the
same
kind
of
variables
determining
the
value
of
tangible
assets
as
you
do
this
intangible
asset.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
we
buy
more
than
a
specially
defined
customer
list.
we
buy
not
just
the
names,
we
buy
people
who
have
already
subscribed
and
are
known
as
seasoned
subscribers--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--and
they're
very
valuable,
so
it's
not
just
a
list
that
we
can
go
out
and
talk
to
people.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
yes.
that's
what
we
did.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
applies
only
when
you
purchase
the
asset,
justice
white.
if
we
are
maintaining...
if
we
didn't
sell
the
paper,
we
just
maintained
the
customers
by
continually...
then
those
are
expenses.
we
can't--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--oh,
yes.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
you
know,
we
have
the
same...
the
cases
discuss
the
very
similar
circumstance
in
which
a
bank
buys
another
bank
and
wants
to
capitalize
and
depreciate
the
core
deposits,
which
are
at-will
relationships,
and
the
courts
uniformly
find
that
those
deposits
can
be
capitalized
and
depreciated.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
thank
you.
