mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
complaint
is
that
the
commissioner
disallowed
it
to
take
depreciation
deductions
for
the
value
of
its
customer
base
when
both
as
a
matter
of
fact
shown
in
this
record
and
as
a
matter
of
assumed
economic
behavior
under
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
the
customer
base
has
not
been
depreciating.
petitioner's
own
statistical
expert
testified...
and
this
is
reproduced
on
page
94
of
the
joint
appendix...
that
in
the
years
under
examination
here
the
circulation
of
the
papers
remained
constant.
there
was
some
turnover
in
the
particular
subscribers,
but
the
circulation
remained
constant.
and
under
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
it
is
not
the
case
that
everything
measurable
is
ipso
facto
amortizable.
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
stated
in
the
houston
chronicle
case,
which
petitioner
in
its
brief
says
is
the
landmark
decision
in
the
area
although
petitioner
did
not
refer
to
the
case
in
the
oral
argument,
in
order
to
be
depreciable
there
must
be
a
value
separate
and
distinct
from
goodwill
that
is
eroding
predictably
over
a
period
of
time.
now,
the
value
in
what
petitioner
refers
to
as
its
customer
relationships,
the
property
that
petitioner
has...
because
it's
only
property
that
under
167...
section
167
of
the
code...
that
can
be
depreciated.
the
property
is
not
the
tangible
property
in
the
persons
of
the
subscribers.
of
course,
persons
are
mortal,
and
erode
over
time.
the...
it's
an
intangible
asset
that
was
paid
for
that
is
symbolized
by
the
subscription
list,
and
the
intangible
asset
was
the
expectancy
of
continued
patronage
that
it
symbolized.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
value
that
was
measured
here
was
a
projection
of
the
expected
duration
of
continued
patronage
by
these
particular
customers.
of
course
there
was
an
on-going
business
here
for
which
a
premium
was
paid
over
the
ascertainable
cost
of
the
tangible
and
depreciable,
intangible
assets,
and
the
ongoing
business
included
this
so-called
relationship
with
customers,
the
habitues
of
the
paper.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
even--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--even
when
there's
a
contract
for
a
term,
if
it's
one
where
regular
renewal
is
anticipated,
the
commissioner
does
not
allow
depreciation
for
that
term
contract
because
that
is
just
a
symbol
of
an
expectancy
of
continued
patronage.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
exactly
the
point,
that
the
likelihood
of
renewal
of
a
continued...
that
it's
really
just
an
evidence
of
a
continuing
patronage,
even
though
the
particular
contract
may
be
for
a
few
months
time
or
a
year's
time.
if
someone
buys
an
apartment
building
and
there
are
many
tenants
there
with
1-year
leases
or
portions
of
remaining
1-year
leases,
a
large
percentage
of
which
are
going
to
be
renewed
or
going
to
stay
on
as
month-to-month
tenants,
the
commissioner
doesn't
allow
depreciation
for
the
remaining
term
of
the
existing
leases
of
the
tenants
who
are
in
the
building.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
what
most
tenants
have
a
right
to
do
when
their
lease
expires,
is
to
stay
on
until
they
give
notice
that
they're
moving
with
a
month-to-month
notice
provision.
i
mean,
it's...
that's
not
depreciable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
correct--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
that's
the
same
situation
we
have
here.
i
mean,
there
are
innovations
in
the
elaboration
of
proof
that
can
be
offered,
but
it
was
never
assumed
that
the
old
customers
resorting
to
the
old
places,
as
goodwill
is
sometimes
described,
were
immortal,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it's
an
expectancy
of
continued
patronage
in
whatever
forms.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
part
of
our
position,
and
we've
pointed
to
cases
in
which
owners
of
land
or
stocks
have
tried
to
give
themselves
a
term
of
years'
interest
in
what
they
own
in
order
to
try
to
depreciate
over
that
term
of
years,
and
that
has
been
disallowed
in
the
case
law.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
not
self-regenerating.
the
finding
was
not
elaborated
upon.
it
was
characterized
that
way.
it's
not
self-regenerating
in
the
sense
that
a
forest
is
self-regenerating
because
the
trees
sprout
up
again
from
the
seedlings.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no
business
has--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
of
course
it
can
be
valued,
there
was
evidence
of
that,
but
not
everything
measurable
is
amortizable,
as
i
said.
it
has
to
be
separate
and
distinct
from
goodwill,
and
the
essence
of
goodwill
is
the
expectancy
of
continued
patronage.
their
actuarial
analysis
of
the
old
customers
has
been
available
as
long
as
we've
had
a
life
insurance
industry.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
customer
base
was
not
a
wasting
asset,
as
i
pointed
out.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
district
court
said
that
it
was
irrelevant
whether
the
subscribers
were
in
fact
increasing,
so
the
district
court
did
not
make
a
finding.
he
said
that
the
government
offered
proof
that
in
fact
the
subscription
list
was
increasing
overall
in
these
eight
newspapers,
but
that
that
was
irrelevant.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
was
projected
income--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
was...
not
exactly.
i'd
have
to
qualify.
that
was
projected
income
to
be
received
from
these--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--on
the
assumption
that
the
newspaper
would
still
be
in
business
to
receive
it,
but
if
it
didn't
do
anything
to
generate
additional
customers,
it
would
be
unlikely
to
be
able
to
receive
it,
and
it
would
be
unlikely
to
continue
to
have
advertisers,
which
are
the
major
source
of
income
for
a
newspaper.
it
was
a
portion
of
the
expectancy
of
continued
patronage
that
the
newspaper
was
looking
forward
to
over
the
life
that
these
customers
and
others
would
be
patrons.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
tried
to
break
away
from
the
overall
expectancy
of
continued
patronage
what
they
would
expect
to
receive
from
the
particular
customers
at
the
particular
time.
i
think
some
light
could--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
their
goodwill
depends
on
the
same
number...
the
same
persons.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that's
right,
there's
no
depreciation
of
goodwill
in
whatever
form
it
takes.
sometimes
goodwill
is
dependent
primarily
on
location
of
the
business.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
it
is
recognized--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
don't...
there's
some
confusion
between
the
residual
method
of
allocating
the
purchase
price
and
after
you've
allocated
the
purchase
price
to
all
the
other
assets
that
can
be
identified,
the
premium
left
over
is
what
is
associated
with
goodwill
and
with
going-concern
value,
both
of
which
are
nondepreciable.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
going-concern
value
is
an
accounting
concept
that
is
associated
largely
with
the
fact
that
facilities
are
in
place,
and
particularly
with
the
fact
that
there's
a
trained
work
force--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes.
yes,
the
expectancy
of
continued
patronage.
that
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
the
essence.
the
commissioner's
regulations,
the
most
recent
regulations
on
goodwill,
which
happened
not
to
be
in
effect
at
the
time
of
this
acquisition
but
which
petitioner
relied
on
in
his
opening
brief,
we
describe
in
some
detail
in
footnote
23
on
page
27
of
our
brief,
and
we
show
that
under
the
regulations
it's
the
class
iii
assets
which
are
the
ones
that
are
residual
after
goodwill
and
going-concern
value
are
allocated,
so
they
have
to
have
a
meaning
other
than
residual.
in
the
commissioner's
own
regulations,
the
terms
of
the
commissioner's
regulations
show
that
the
residual
way
of
defining
what
goodwill
is
is
inconsistent
with
the
terms
of
the
regulations
as
we
point
out
in
our
analysis
of
the
regulations
and
in
the
last
sentence
of
that
footnote,
and
petitioner
did
not
choose
to
respond
to
that
in
petitioner's
reply
brief.
goodwill
is
looked
upon
that
way.
i
think
it
might
be
illuminating
if
i
could
give
the
court
some
rather
simply
hypothetical
examples
of
purchases
of
businesses
which
show
that
the
actual
expectancy
of
continued
patronage
will
be
roughly
the
same,
even
though
the
circumstances
of
the
business
vary
dramatically
and
the
rate
of
customer
turnover
that
would
be
expected,
and
one
example
that
i
could
give
would
be
three
separate
purchases
of
three
separate,
similar,
prospering
fast-food
restaurants.
in
case
a,
the
restaurant
is
in
a
residential
area
of
a
small
to
medium-size
city
such
as
these
newspapers
are
published
in,
with
a
relatively
stable
population,
and
the
customers
consist
in
large
part
of
young
to
middle-aged
parents
with
their
children,
of
young
adults
and
teenagers
who
come
in
on
their
own,
and
the
expectancy
would
be
that,
in
another
10
or
15
years,
many
of
these
teenagers
would
be
coming
in
as
parents
with
their
own
children,
many
of
the
children
presently
coming
in
with
their
parents
would
be
coming
in
as
teenagers
or
young
adults
on
their
own,
et
cetera.
case
b
would
be
a
similar
prospering
fast-food
restaurant
located
directly
across
the
street
from
a
college
campus
with
dormitories,
and
it
can
be
shown
that
more
than
90
percent
of
the
existing
customers
will
turn
over
within
a
4-year
time,
yet
the
purchaser's
expectancy
would
be
that
5
years
from
now
he
would
have
roughly
the
same
number
of
college
students
eating
in
the
restaurant.
case
c
would
be
a
similar
fast-food
restaurant
prospering
that
is
located
in
a
service
area
along
an
interstate
highway
or
at
an
airport,
or
across
the
street
from
the
entrance
to
a
resort
such
as
disney
world.
most
of
the
customers
are
seen
for
the
last
time
when
they
walk
out
the
door,
or
will
come
back
only
very
seldom,
but
the
expectancy
is
that
the
business
will
go
on
much
as
it
has
historically.
now--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--until
i
withdraw
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
only...
only
in
a
very
limited
way.
i
mean,
any
individual
can
withdraw
his
funds
from
a
bank
account
at
any
time.
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
said
that
a
premium
is
paid
for
a
bank
location
that
has
a
large
volume
of
core
deposits,
but
is
that
premium
paid
because
the
purchaser
thinks
that
this
is
a
wasting
asset,
or
because
it's
an
indicium
of
the
level
of
business
that
can
be
expected
to
be
done
at
this
particular
bank
location?
i
mean,
of
course
it's
less
daunting
for
the
purchaser
of
a
business
to
be
faced
only
with
the
task
of
maintaining
an
existing
level
of
patronage
than
to
try
to
build
up
a
level
of
patronage
that
is
not
already
existing
in
the
business.
it's
an
expectancy
of
future
patronage
that
is
symbolized,
rather
than
a
separate
value.
any
of
these
subscribers
could,
the
day
after
the
purchase,
call
up
and
say
i
don't
want
the
paper
to
be
delivered
any
more,
and
they
would
have
no
obligation
except
to
pay
for
papers
that
they've
already
received.
that's
not
terribly
different
from
the
people
who
have
an
appointment
at
the
beauty
parlor
for...
each
week,
and
the
beauty
parlor
is
purchased.
these
people
have
the
choice
of
whether
to
return
or
not
to
return.
even
though
it's
not
a
contractual
obligation,
it's
their
habitual
place
to
get
a
repetitive
service
done.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
would
agree
with
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
didn't...
we
in
effect
did.
we
said
that
we
don't
object
to
the
proof
as
proof
of
what
is
being
shown,
which
is
how
long
these
particular
subscriber
relationships
may
be
expected
to
last,
but
that
they
do
not
show
a
wasting
asset
separate
and
distinct
from
goodwill.
that
was
our
legal
position.
the
problem
isn't
a
failure
of
proof
here,
or
that
the
proof
was
inadequate,
it
was
that
it
didn't
prove
a
depreciable
wasting
asset
that
was
predictably
diminishing
over
time.
the
customer
base
is
what
people
are
interested
in.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
because--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i'm
sure
we
refined
it,
as
we
often
do,
but
we
certainly
did
not
take
the
position
that
they
would
be
entitled
to
a
depreciation
deduction
if
they
could
show
that
the
particular
subscribers
on
the
list
would
last
over
a
particular
period
of
time.
many
businesses
can
make
a
list
of
customers.
some
of
them
could
compile
them
from
their
charge
account
lists.
others
have
records
of
them
at
a
medical
clinic
or
what-have-you.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
am
not
aware
that
we
conceded
that
contrary
to
all
the
case
law--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--if
we...
we...
well,
because
it
was
not
contractually
based
we
didn't
perhaps
caution
the
court
about
the
refinement
between
contracts
that
are
expected
to
be
renewed
regularly,
which
are
not
depreciable,
and
term
contracts
that
are.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
fact
is
that
sufficiently
long-term
contractual
obligations
can
be
valued
as
a
particular
asset
in
situations
where
they
don't
represent
just
the
normal
short-term
contracts
that
are
expected
to
be
renewed.
this
is
a
difficult
area
of
litigation.
we've
cited
some
of
the
cases
for
it.
it's
a
difficult
distinction
to
draw,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--of
course
it
has
value,
and
a
subscription
list
that
is
sold
separately
from
an
on-going
business
that
is
to
be
continued
can
be
evaluated
for
its
value
as
a
marketing
tool
by
the
purchaser,
and
it
has
value
to
the
purchaser
of
the
on-going
business,
but
that
value
is
put
into
its
capital
account
and
it
is
offset
against
the
price
received
when
the
asset
is
sold,
when
the
business
is
sold.
it
is
not
a
depreciable
wasting
asset
that
predictably
erodes
in
a
determinate
way
over
a
period
of
years.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
contractual
only
in
the
sense
that
you
have
to
hear
from
the
subscriber
to
cut
off
the
service
of
the
particular
subscriber,
if,
in
fact,
that
would
even
be
a
transferable
obligation
to
someone
who
wasn't
carrying
on
the
same
business.
i
rather
doubt
that
it
would
be
legally
transferable
to
a
purchaser
of
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
might
depend
on
what
was
going
to
happen
to
those
campus
facilities,
and
i
rather
doubt
that
the
purchaser
in
those
circumstances
would
have
paid
a
premium
that
could
be
attributed
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
valuation
of
the
rest
of
the
assets
that
were
bought
would
probably
preclude
any
premium
left
over
for
goodwill
for
an
expectancy
of
future
patronage
in
a
situation
where
the
expectancy
does
not
look
good.
it's
only
where
a
premium
is
paid
that
there's
any
asset
of
goodwill
to
start
with.
