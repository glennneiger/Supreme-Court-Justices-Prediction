justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
it
does
not
lend
itself
easily
to
announcement
from
the
bench
and
perhaps
it
suffices
to
say
that
it
concerns
the
income
tax
deductibility
of
an
item
called
"paid
subscribers"
that
a
newspaper
publisher
acquired
in
the
acquisition
of
another
news
organization.
the
internal
revenue
services
regarded
this
asset
as
indistinguishable
from
goodwill
and
disallowed
any
deduction
for
it.
when
suit
was
instituted
in
the
district
in
new
jersey,
however,
judgment
was
given
for
the
taxpayer
petitioner
and
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
held
that
even
though
the
asset
may
have
a
limited
useful
life
that
can
be
ascertain
with
reasonable
accuracy,
its
value
was
not
distinguishable
from
goodwill.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment
and
hold
that
this
particular
taxpayer
may
depreciate
the
item
in
question.
we
conclude
that
this
taxpayer
has
successfully
borne
its
very
substantial
burden.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
has
joined
therein
by
the
chief
justice
and
by
justices
white
and
scalia.
