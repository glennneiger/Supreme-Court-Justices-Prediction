justice

day
o'connor
mr.
phillips,
the
respondent
has
come
back
with
a
proposal
that
suggests
that
the
evidence
in
this
case
meets
all
those
standards.
are
you
going
to
address
that
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
phillips,
are
you
going
to
suggest
some
kind
of
a
test
that
courts
could
employ
in
knowing
when
there
is
a
likelihood
of
bias
or
arbitrariness
in
these
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
do
we...
is
it
just
we
know
it
when
we
see
it?
i
mean,
what
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
tribe,
where
in
this
record
do
you
find
that
the
jury
was
told
there
was
some
$5
to
$8
million
gain
at
stake,
and
where
in
the
record
does
it
show
the
courts
below
had
those
figures?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
haven't
been
able
to
find
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
doesn't
seem
to
be
the
basis
on
which
this
was
tried
or--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--presented
to
the
jury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
looks
to
me
like
you're
trying
to
concoct
something
that
might
have
served,
if
it
had
all
been
presented,
but
i
don't
find
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
it
was
never...
i
didn't
find
anything
in
the
record
demonstrating
dollar
amounts
of
projected
loss
to
your
client.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
tribe,
is
there...
where
in
the
instructions
is
this
theory
expounded?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
were
they
told
anything
except
consider
the
actual
damages,
which
here
were
$19,000,
and
the
wealth
of
txo?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
joint
appendix
where?
