we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
92-479,
txo
production
corporation
v.
alliance
resources
corporation.
mr.
phillips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia
gave
the
impression
i
thought
in
its
opinion
not
that
there
was
any
physical...
but
that
your
client
acted
with
malice
in
the
really
nasty
sense
of
the
word.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
certainly
if
you're
looking
for
reasons
why
the
jury
might
have
found
$10
million,
it's
more
likely
that
they
found
malice
than
that
they
simply
found
reckless
disregard.
wouldn't
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
phillips,
did
i
gather
from
a
remark
you
made
a
moment
ago
that
you
think
that
west
virginia
could
not
punish
a...
in
the
sense
of
inflict
punitive
damages
on
a
defendant
who
had
committed
one
bad
act
in
west
virginia
and
had
committed
a
series
of
similar
bad
acts
in
other
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
it
were
shown
that
no
lawsuits
had
ever
been
brought
against
the
defendant
for
these
bad...
similar
bad
acts
in
other
states?
so,
this
would
be
presumably
the
only
opportunity
to
punish
him
for
those.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
a
civil
proceeding,
usually
the
standards
are
more
lax
than
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
tribe,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could
you
read
it?
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
high
multiple
of
what
did
they
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
would
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
put
anybody
on
notice
if
they
don't
even
discuss
what
the
denominator
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia
pass
on
that
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
mr.
tribe,
may
i
just
ask?
these
are
state
law
issues
that
we
don't
have
to
examine,
but
just
for
me
to
understand
the
quiet
title
litigation
here.
suppose
that
the
deed
that
they
found
had
been
given
to
the
individual
and
then
his
successor
in
title
was
i
think
the
crews
company.
suppose
that
deed
had,
in
fact,
granted
the
mineral
rights
so
that
alliance
didn't
have
them.
would,
under
your
theory
of
the
case,
txo
have
a
duty
to
then
encourage
crews
to
deed
the
property
back
to
alliance,
or
could
txo
legitimately
take
it
for
itself?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
