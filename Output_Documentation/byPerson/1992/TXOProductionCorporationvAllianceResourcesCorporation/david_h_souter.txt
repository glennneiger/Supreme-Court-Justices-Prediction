justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
phillips,
on
that
point,
if
the
state
of
west
virginia
had
had,
prior
to
your
client's
conduct
here,
a
clear
rule,
whether
it
be
a
rule
of
statute
or
previously
announced
common
law,
to
the
effect
that
punitive
damages
may
be
awarded
by
reference
not
merely
to
the
verdict
in
the
tort
action,
but
by
reference
to
the
extent...
the
economic
extent
of
the
harm
either
intended
or
potentially
threatened
by
the
tort,
even
though
not
realized,
would
you
say
that
there
was
either
a
procedural
or
a
substantive
due
process
violation
in
applying
that
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
how
you
get
a
basis
for
$10
million,
if
there
is
one,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
let
me
start
just
with
the
general
proposition,
which
is
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
with
my
question.
would
there
be
as
a
general
judgment...
would
there
be
a
procedural
or
substantive
due
process
defect
in
that
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
had
complete...
if
you
had
adequate
knowledge
of
the
rule
in
advance,
why
would
it
make
any
difference
even
if
it
were
a
common
law
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
your
quarrel
here
is
not
with
the
general
proposition
that
the
other
side
advances,
that
in
fact,
it's
the
risk
of
harm
threatened
that
should
be
the
basis
for
engaging
in
a
proportionality
analysis,
if
that's
what
we're
going
to
call
it,
but
your
objection
is
to
its
application
here.
and
is
it
your
objection
that
you
did
not
have
adequate
notice
that
such
was
your
exposure?
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
did
you
have
any...
were
you
on
notice
that
there
was,
in
fact,
a
different
and
more
favorable
theory
of
punitive
damages
in
west
virginia?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
actually
i
suppose
it
ought
to
be
at
the
time
of
the
conduct.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the
case
boil
down
then
to
the
fact
that
you
really
do
not
dispute
the
position
as
a
general
matter
put
forward
by
the
other
side
that
the
expected
or
anticipated
harm,
even
though
not
realized,
can
be
the
base
for...
the
baseline,
as
it
will,
for
the
award,
that
we
are
really
here
to
review
the
question
whether,
in
fact,
there
was
adequate
evidence
to
support
the
instructions
as
given?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
a
fairly
narrow
case
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
that
isn't
what
you
would
have
us
decide.
you
would
not
have
us
decide
whether
there's
a
limit
based
on
excessiveness.
you
would
have
us
decide
whether
there
was
an
adequate
evidentiary
foundation
for
the
jury
to
return
the
verdict
it
did
given
the
instructions
it
had.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
you're
telling
us
that
we're
supposed
to
decide
whether
there
is
an
evidentiary
instruction-verdict
fit,
which
is
a
different
concept
of
fit.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
may
well
be
a...
for
$10
million,
it
may
well
be
a
very
worthy
exercise,
but
i
think
it's
a
little
bit
narrower
than
what
you
were
saying
a
minute
ago.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
it
never
can
be
used
again.
as
a
theoretical
matter,
it
cannot
be
used
in
a
civil
punitive
damages
award?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
do
we...
how
would
you
articulate
the
permissible
role?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
interrupt
you
just
with
one
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
that
additional
amount,
in
effect,
be
the...
be
calculated
as
the
additional
amount
to
deter
the
additional
or
the
further
economic
harm,
let's
say,
outside
of
the
state
itself
if
this
conduct
were
to
continue?
in
other
words,
you
said
it
may
be
used
for
determining
malice.
well,
maybe
this...
i
don't
know
how
you
articulate
the
add-on
for
malice,
but
i
suppose
that
malice's
add-on
would
be
something
less
than
a
calculation
of
a
deterrence
amount
if
we
considered
the
fact
that
there
had
been
10
other
attempts
to
do
what
was
done
here
with
the
same
objective
in
mind,
so
that
if
the
potential
gain
here
was
$5
million,
the
jury
could
consider
that
there
had
been
attempts
to
gain
$50
million.
that
i
suppose
would
take
you
beyond
a
mere
malice
add-on.
would
that
be
impermissible?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
my
example
wouldn't
be
off
the
charts.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
one
you
say...
pardon
me?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
did
refer,
didn't
they,
in
the...
or
the
instruction
referred
to
deterring
other
conduct
in
other
circumstances.
so,
i
suppose
that
carries
with
it
the
implication
of
potential
gain
in
these
other
circumstances.
i
can't
seem
to
find
the
instruction
now.
what
was
it?
6?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
assume
a
degree
of
analytical
sophistication
on
the
part
of
the
jury,
which
is
a
little
bit
generous,
but
when
you
start
talking
about
deterrence,
what
you're
really
talking
about
is
deterrence
in
relation
to
the
temptation.
and
the
temptation
is
what
you're
referring
to
by
potential
gain,
isn't
it?
