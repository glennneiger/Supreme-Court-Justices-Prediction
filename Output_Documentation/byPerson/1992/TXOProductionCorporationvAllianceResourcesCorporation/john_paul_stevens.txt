mr.
phillips,
why
do
you
say
no
potential
harm?
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
referred...
of
course,
they
were
talking
about
garnes
and
so
forth,
but
it
could
potentially
cause
millions
of
dollars
in
damages
to
other
victims.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
is
that
part
of
the
calculus
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
don't
think
there's
any
basis
in
this
record
for
figuring
out
how
much
harm
might
have
been
caused
to
this
particular
litigant
if
the
program
had
been
successful.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
think
the
expected
gain
might
have
been?
what
do
you
think
the
record
indicates
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
couldn't
tell
how
valuable
the
property
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
a
career
offender
could
be
punished
for
a
career
of
crime
in
another
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know,
but
you're
arguing
it's
not
a
permissible
factor,
as
i
understand
you.
you're
arguing
that
out-of-jurisdiction
wrongdoing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
not
a
permissible
factor
in
the
calculation--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
this
proceeding,
but
it
would
be
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
obviously.
