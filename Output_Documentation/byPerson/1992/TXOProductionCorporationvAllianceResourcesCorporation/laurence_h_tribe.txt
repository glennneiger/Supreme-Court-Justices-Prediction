mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
rather
like
the
gas
in
the
wells
in
the
thousand
acre
tract,
seems
to
be
vanishing
before
our
very
eyes.
mr.
phillips
says
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's,
i
think,
very
important
question,
what
standard
after
all
does
he
ask
this
court
to
promulgate,
says
he
knew
it
when
he
saw
it.
but
he
doesn't
really
offer
a
test
different
from
that
in
the
instructions
in
this
case,
as
i'll
show
in
a
moment.
and
i
do
think
that
perhaps
txo,
which
has
been
adjudicated
guilty
of
a
number
of
land
frauds,
has
sold
this
court
something
of
a
dry
hole
because
the
case
was
originally
presented
as
though
the
relevant
ratio
was
526
to
1.
but
i
think
we
now
see
that's
apples
to
oranges.
that
is,
the
numerator
of
that
fraction
came
from
a
$10
million
figure
which,
as
i
will
show,
was
well
grounded
in
this
record
in
terms
of
expected
gain,
what
did
they
hope
to
gain
not
simply
by
recording
fraudulently
a
phony
quitclaim
deed,
but
by
doing
it
as
part
of
this
particular
century
old
pattern
of
land
fraud.
the
numerator
was
then
upped
somewhat
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
real
chance
that
someone
will
get
away
undetected.
in
this
case,
they
didn't.
they
were
caught.
the
denominator,
the
$19,000...
that's
where
this
fancy
526
to
1
ratio
comes
from...
had
nothing
to
do
with
what
they
expected
to
gain.
it
just
happened
to
be
how
much
it
cost
to
get
attorneys
to
stand
up
to
txo
and
to
stop
them
dead
in
their
tracks
in
this
declaratory
judgment
action.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
o'connor--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
o'connor,
there
is
no
reference
below
in
the
courts
to
the
$5
to
$8
million
figure.
there
is
reference
through
simple
multiplication
that
would
give
it
to
us.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that
i...
let--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--let
me
address--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--let
me
address
that
directly.
i
don't
think
that's
true.
that
is
the
center
of
their
claim,
somehow
that
this
case
was
tried
on
a
different
theory.
the
fact
is
it
was
tried
on
this
very
theory.
let
me
turn
to,
for
example,
our
closing
argument
to
the
jury
in
this
case.
after
the
dollar
figures
had
been
put
in
on
how
many
wells
could
be
dug,
on
how
much
gas
per
well,
on
how
many
dollars
per
thousand
cubic
feet,
in
the
closing
argument...
and
if
you
want
the
citations,
it's
pages
746
to
58
and
779
to
83
of
the
transcript.
let
me
read
a
characteristic
sentence.
it
was
full
of
these.
txo
thought
this
was
going
to
be
a
huge
money-making
lease.
that's
why
it
was
worth
the
scheme,
and
the
punishment
should
fit
it
so
we
can
stop
people
from
stealing
people's
land
with
fraudulent
quitclaim
deeds.
and
then
in
the
brief
in
the
west
virginia
supreme
court,
our
brief...
i
don't
know
why
they
think
this
argument
was
one--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no.
the
jury
was
told,
with
reference
to
the
figures,
that
they
would
add
up
to,
i
believe,
millions
of
dollars,
but
it
was
never
quantified
as
5
to
8.3.
that
is,
that
arithmetic
is
something
the
jury
would
have
had
to
do
for
itself.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
justice
o'connor,
as
mr.
phillips'
brief
says,
in
this
case,
the
expected
gain
to
txo,
if
they
had
gotten
away
with
it...
that
is,
if
they
had
successfully
gotten
mr.
signaigo
to
sign
the
false
affidavit,
and
if
they
had
managed
to
get
their
declaratory
judgment
so
that
they
made
it
look
as
though
they
didn't
have
to
pay
the
22
percent
to
the
respondents,
the
expected
gain
to
them
was
exactly
equal
to
the
expected
loss.
that's
their
point
in
their
reply
brief...
expected
loss
of--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
kennedy,
let
me
address
those
points.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
kennedy,
with
respect
to
the
discount
rate,
we
were
projecting
figures
using
the
$3
that
was
the
price
in
1985.
txo's
own
experts
in
defense
exhibit
14
indicated
that
they
expected
the
price
of
gas,
over
the
20-year
life
of
the
wells,
to
go
up
by
a
factor
of
4
or
5.
that
would
more
than
offset
any
rational
discount
rate.
the
most
important
point,
however,
isn't
that.
it
is
that
the
time
to
litigate
the
amount
of
expected
gain
is
surely
not
in
this
court
reviewing
this
case
under
the
fourteenth
amendment's
due
process
clause.
that
is,
we
did
introduce
before
the
jury
dollar
figures
and
a
range
of
estimates
about
the
number
of
wells.
even
if
you
take
the
lower
estimate
of
15
wells,
you
come
up
not
with
$8.3
million,
but
$5
million
as
to
what
they
hoped.
and
it
would
only
take
a
multiplier
of
2
then
to
get
punitive
damages
of
$10
million.
but
the
time
to
contest
those
numbers
was
at
trial.
you
see,
if
it
were
true
that
no
one
was
thinking
about
expected
gain
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
in
a
case
of
this
kind,
so
that
they
were
basically
bamboozled...
they
didn't
know
that
that
was
the
focus...
that
might
be,
though
not
necessarily
for
constitutional
purposes,
enough
of
an
explanation
for
why
they
didn't
do
it
at
trial.
but
at
trial,
when
we
introduced
these
numbers,
we
didn't
get
any
counter-figures
from
txo.
on
the
contrary,
when
they
put
on
ken
walty
and
mike
good
as
key
witnesses,
it
was
on
cross-examination
of
those
witnesses
at
pages
544
to
553
and
672
to
677
of
the
transcript
that
we
clearly
established
that
they
expected
a
multi-million
dollar
income
stream.
their
whole
strategy
was
don't
think
about
that.
we're
innocent.
we
relied
on
advice
of
counsel,
arguments
that
have
been
demolished
below
and
rejected
by
this
jury.
when
i
get
to
the
jury
instructions,
i
think
that
will
be
clear.
they
also
ended
up
saying,
as
they
said
here,
don't
punish
the
innocent.
we,
after
all,
didn't
make
all
this
money.
but,
of
course,
the
theory
of
deterrence
in
west
virginia
and
a
number
of
other
states
is
that
you
punish
in
accord
with
what
they
hoped
and
intended
to
gain,
not
what
they
happened
to
gain.
that's
why--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--if
you--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes,
they
were,
justice
o'connor.
if
you
look
at
plaintiffs'
instruction
number...
defendants'
instruction
number
6a
in
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--joint
appendix,
page
34,
an
instruction
which
is,
of
course,
considerably
more
detailed
than
the
one
this
court
held
sufficient
in
the
haslip
case.
the
last
paragraph--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
the
critical
thing
is
you're
supposed
to
look
at
the
intent
of
the
party
committing
the
act,
as
well
as
the
extent
committed,
and
the
purpose,
it's
explained
at
the
end,
is
to
deter
txo
and
others
from
committing
like
offenses
in
the
future.
and
then
it
says
to
in
fact
deter
it,
may
require
a
larger
fine
and
one
of
larger
means.
now,
this
instruction
in
these
respects
was
not
objected
to.
there
was
no
suggestion
on
their
part
at
trial
that
they
were
entitled
to
something
more
precise.
and
west
virginia
put
them
on
notice
in
a
case
called
wells
against
smith
in
1982
of
this
entire
theory,
which
is
standard
in
west
virginia.
that
is,
in
wells,
the
court
had
said
that
where
the
defendant's
conduct
has
been
egregious,
but
the
plaintiff
has
suffered
indeterminate
or
nominal
damages,
one
needs
to
award
a
high
multiple.
and,
indeed,
in
that
case
they
said
the
sky
is
the
limit.
no
ratio
is
relevant.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
they
don't
address
what
the
denominator
is,
but
the
theory--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
would
suggest
if
we
were
in
an
arithmetic
class,
that
might
be
true,
but
common
sense
out
in
west
virginia
i
think
tells
people
when
the
law
was
that
we're
going
to
punish
you
in
terms
of
the
outrageousness
of
what
you
tried
to
do,
that
you're
not
supposed
to
be
doing
arithmetic.
in
other
words,
there
was
no
numerator,
there
was
no
denominator.
the
suggestion
was
that
looking
at
ratios
isn't
relevant.
what
you
look
at
is
what
did
they
hope
to
get
away
with,
and
then
you
add
a
kicker
for
the
chance
that
they
would
never
have
been
caught.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
not
quite.
page
8
of
the
brief
in
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia
used
these
numbers
to
calculate
this
figure,
$13,676,252,
was...
and
i'm
reading...
the
price...
the
prize
txo
hoped
to
grab
by
fraudulently
disparaging
appellee's
title.
that
$13
million
figure
was
a
bit
lower
than
some
of
the
other
numbers
because
it
was
based
on
some
later
projections
after
one
well
had
proved
disappointing.
but
you
notice
they
do
not
deny--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
was
a
total
revenue
figure.
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
no.
that's
right.
the
22
percent
of
that--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
kennedy,
i
had
thought
that
the
relevant
standard
in
substantive
due
process
attack
on
a
judgment
such
as
this
is
whether
there
is
any
rational
basis
that
can
be
offered.
in
nordlinger
v.
hahn,
it
was
stressed
that
what
matters
is
not
how
the
state's
decision
makers
articulate
that,
but
whether
one
can
find
a
rational
basis.
more
recently
than
nordlinger,
in
growe
v.
emison
this
court
said
that
one
defers
to
judicial,
as
well
as
legislative
decision
making.
it
was
for
that
reason
that
we
felt
free
and
that
i
would
fully
defend
taking
the
numbers
that
were
before
this
jury,
and
which
txo
did
not
undertake
to
attack
at
trial,
to
show
how
very
easily
from
them
one
could
understand
the
conclusion
of
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
that
a
judgment
of
this
magnitude
was
needed
to
deter
this
kind
of
harm.
and,
indeed,
the
instruction...
to
go
to
the
questions
that
were
asked
with
respect
to
the
instructions
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
white,
if
you
look
not
just
at
6a,
justice
o'connor,
but
if
you
also
look
at
plaintiffs'
instruction
2
on
page
26
of
the
joint
appendix,
look
at
what
this
jury
had
to
find
in
order
to
find
txo
liable.
they
had
to
find...
second
paragraph
of
instruction
2...
txo
filed
the
quitclaim
deed
with
the
intent
to
hurt
the
interests
of
the
defendants,
in
other
words,
ill
will.
they
also
had
to
find
that
txo
acted
maliciously.
they
had
to
find
malice
and
without
good
faith
and
recorded
the
quitclaim
deed
with
an
intent
to
hurt
the
defendants
rather
than
clear
up
the
title.
so
that
when,
on
that
basis,
the
jury
returned
this
award,
it's
not
so
surprising
to
me,
given
that
the
case
was
litigated
below
on
this
very
theory,
that
that
was
the
closing
argument,
that
that
was
the
brief
in
the
state
supreme
court,
that
that
was
what
the
instructions
called
the
jury's
attention
to.
what
did
they
intend
to
get
away
with,
not
how
much
did
it
cost
to
catch
them.
given
all
of
that,
it's
not
so
surprising
that
the
west
virginia
supreme
court,
finding
this
attempted
fraud...
and
i
now
quote
from
that
court...
no
isolated
incident,
but
part
of
txo's
pattern
and
practice
to
defraud
and
coerce
those
in
positions
of
unequal
bargaining
power,
a
pattern
that
the
court
said
threatened,
quote,
millions
of
dollars
in
damages
to
other
victims,
unquote.
that's
not
just
other
victims
in
oklahoma
or
texas.
the
millions
of
dollars
in
damage
from
numbers
they
didn't
undertake
to
refute
at
trial
would
have
been
to
us
because
those
are
royalties
that
we
would
have
expected
to
gain.
it's
no
surprise
that
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
found
on
that
basis
that,
quote,
an
award
of
this
magnitude
is
necessary
to
discourage
txo
from
continuing
this
pattern
and
practice
of
fraud,
trickery,
and
deceit,
unquote.
now,
if
the
theory
is
constitutional...
and
i
see
no
conceivable
basis
as
a
matter
of
substantive
due
process
for
saying
the
state
cannot
use
this
as
a
way
of
deciding
how
much
is
needed
to
deter
and
punish,
no
basis
for
saying
that
you
can't
look
at
how
much
they
hoped
to
gain,
even
optimistically
that
you
can't
look
at
that,
but
must
instead
look
at
some
multiple
of
what
it
costs
to
prevent
them
from
succeeding.
given
that
there's
no
basis
in
substantive
due
process
for
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
they're
left
with
is
the
idea
that
somehow
there
wasn't
sufficient
evidence
here.
and
i
agree
that
the
evidence
that
was
in
the
record
wasn't
added
up
in
precisely
the
way
our
brief
does,
but
surely,
that
is
a
burden
that
would
have
fallen
on
txo
at
trial.
and
it's
not
a
proper
question
for
this
court
to
second
guess
the
reasonableness
of
the
west
virginia
judiciary
in
saying
that
$10
million
was
needed.
it
seems
to
me
that
all
they're
left
with
is
some
theoretical
arguments
that
one
might
debate,
arguments
about
what's
the
best
way
to
deter.
do
you
go
after
people,
whether
they
succeed
or
fail,
as
west
virginia
does?
in
fact,
in
its
constitution,
article
3,
section
5,
it
says
that
the
penalty
should
be
proportionate
to
the
nature
of
the
offense.
in
fact,
with
respect
to
aggravated...
attempted
aggravated
robbery,
west
virginia
says
we'll
punish
you
the
same
way
whether
you
succeed
or
fail.
is
that
the
best
way,
or
is
it
best
to
only
add
a
very
high
kicker
when
the
wrongdoer
succeeds?
well,
that's
an
interesting
question.
most
states,
the
27
amici
who
have
filed
a
brief
in
support
of
our
position,
take
the
view
that
it's
for
them
to
decide
and
that
they
think
it
is
more
just,
as
well
as
more
effective,
to
use
this
theory
and
to
use
a
theory
which,
by
the
way,
west
virginia
has
officially
endorsed.
the
west
virginia
attorney
general,
at
pages
6
to
7
of
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
27
states,
endorses
this
very
theory
quoting
from
the
garnes
case,
and
garnes
really
expresses
the
view
that
the
reason
it
is
improper
to
play
with
numbers
and
look
at
these
proportions
is
precisely
that
it's
perverse
in
terms
of
incentives
and
in
terms
of
fairness.
what
it
means
is
that
when
a
victim
is
smart
enough
and
tough
enough
to
stand
up
to
an
extortionate
scheme,
as
the
respondents
did
here,
then
the
wrongdoer
is
going
to
be,
in
effect,
rewarded,
rewarded
because
the
most
that
can
be
charged
against
it
is
the
attorney's
fees
or
some
reasonably
low
multiple
thereof.
because
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
has
quite
clearly
rejected
that
approach
and
has
said
instead
you
look
to
the
expected
gain,
it
seems
to
me
that
all
that's
left
is
some
possible
procedural
due
process
arguments,
and
perhaps
i
should
turn
to
those.
i
don't
think,
by
the
way,
that
the
court
ought
to
reach
the
merits
of
some
of
the
fancier
procedural
due
process
arguments
that
we
have
here
because
txo's
only
argument
at
trial
was
about
the
first
amendment.
they
said
that
slander
of
title
violates
the
first
amendment,
but
nowhere
at
trial
did
they
argue
that
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
one
is
entitled
to
some
different
or
more
precise
jury
instructions
or
some
further
kind
of
explanation
by
a
trial
judge.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is,
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
said
these
damages
are
not
excessive.
they
also
said
that
their
new
rules,
which
are
rather
like
what
i
gather
txo
would
like
this
court
to
promulgate
somehow
for
all
50
states...
their
new
rules
about
jury
instructions
and
post-verdict
explanation
in
the
garnes
case
should
not
be
applied
retroactively.
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
ruled
that.
but
it
was
never
asked
to
rule
that
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
of
its
own
force
special
instructions
beyond
those
that
were
used
in
haslip.
it
was
never
asked
to
rule
for
the
first
time
that
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
requires
states
to
assign
some
special
role
to
the
trial
judge
post-verdict.
and
when
we
made
that
argument,
the
response
of
txo
at
footnote
33
of
their
brief
was
that
it's
frivolous.
it's
frivolous
to
say
they
waived
it,
and
to
prove
that,
they
give
you
a
23-word
snippet
from
their
brief
below.
i
would
invite
you
to
look
at
the
relevant
parts
of
that
brief
when
there
is
time.
in
their
reply
in
support
of
certiorari
in
their
appendix,
they
reproduced
the
entire
relevant
portion
of
their
brief
below.
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
that
whole
argument
is
simply
west
virginia
law
under
garnes
should
entitle
us
retroactively
to
these
special
procedures.
if
the
court,
however,
were
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
procedural
attack,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
txo
ought
to
lose.
the
state
supreme
court's
post-verdict
review,
which
was
critical
in
haslip,
was
at
least
as
thorough
here
as
in
the
alabama
supreme
court.
now,
the
petitioners
make
some
mileage
out
of
justice
neely's
rhetoric;
that
is,
they
make
something
of
the
fact
that
he
used
some
homespun
shorthand
to
categorize
wrongdoers
as
really
mean
or
really
stupid,
but
i
think
that's
a
pretty
irrelevant
distraction.
his
colleagues
called
him
to
task
for
what
they
thought
was
unduly
colorful.
in
any
event,
he
explained
in
good
old-fashioned
legalese,
very
traditional,
exactly
what
those
terms
meant,
and
lo
and
behold,
they
meant
exactly
what
we
would
expect,
intentional,
malicious,
deliberate
wrongdoing
was
the
kind
that
really
mean
was
supposed
to
cover.
so,
one
can't
make
a
federal
case
out
of
that.
as
far
as
the
trial
judge's
review
post-verdict,
they
make
the
rather
astonishing
argument
now...
they
didn't
make
it
below,
but
they
make
the
argument
now,
supported
by
at
least
some
of
their
amici,
that
the
federal
constitution
guarantees
them
a
right
to,
quote,
several
layers,
unquote,
of
judicial
review...
that's
at
footnote
38
of
their
reply...
and,
therefore,
to
a
fuller
post-verdict
explanation
by
the
trial
judge
than
they
got
here.
i
would
submit
that
that's
untenable.
even
in
criminal
cases,
this
court
has
held
ever
since
mccain
v.
durston,
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
entitles
you
to
only
one
level
of
judicial
review.
it's
entirely
up
to
the
states
how
to
allocate
post-verdict
assessments
as
between
their
trial
and
appellate
judiciaries.
and,
anyway,
txo
could
have
received,
had
they
only
asked,
a
much
fuller
explanation
from
the
trial
judge
of
just
why
he
thought
$10
million
was
reasonable.
and
that
does
go
back
to
the
questions
that
both
you,
justice
o'connor,
and
you,
justice
kennedy,
asked.
that
is,
if
one
is
nervous
about
the
attempt
in
hindsight
to
figure
out
just
exactly
where
the
$10
million
could
have
come
from,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fault
for
that
difficulty
should
be
placed
squarely
at
the
feet
of
txo.
they
had,
after
all,
a
bifurcated
trial.
under
west
virginia
rule
of
civil
procedure
42(c),
they
could
have
had
a
trifurcated
trial
with
a
separate
proceeding
on
punitive
damages.
west
virginia
would
have
fully
entitled
them
to
put
special
interrogatories
to
the
jury.
if
they
wanted
to
know
exactly
how
these
numbers
were
derived,
they
could
have
asked,
but
it
was
too
obvious
to
anyone
i
think
for
them
to
make
quite
a
fuss
about
it.
their
whole
strategy
was,
and
it
seems
here
to
be,
simply
to
emphasize,
look,
we
may
have
done
terrible
things,
but
that
was
in
other
states,
and
here
we
were
innocent,
although
the
jury
evidently
found
that
they
were
guilty
of
the
most
scurrilous,
deliberate,
fraudulent
behavior.
as
far
as
the
jury's
role
is
concerned,
not
only
were
the
instructions
given
in
this
case
considerably
more
constraining
than
those
that
the
court
found
sufficient
in
the
haslip
case,
not
only
did
they
require
a
showing
of
indifference
to
the
rights
of
others,
something
very
much
like
the
utter
disregard
phrase
that
the
court
thought
sufficient
when
given
a
further
gloss
in
your
opinion
yesterday
in
creech,
justice
o'connor,
not
only
that,
but
they
didn't
ask
for
any
further
instructions,
as
we
show
in
some
detail
in
our
brief.
beyond
that
they
waived
any
requests
for
including
proportionality
in
the
instructions.
we
explained
that.
they
were
satisfied
to
have
the
jury
have
even
less
guidance.
as
a
matter
of
strategy,
their
whole
game
was
we're
innocent.
they
didn't
want
to
focus
the
jury
on
punitive,
and
so,
they
can
surely
not
complain
now
even
if
the
court
were
to
reach
that
issue
on
the
merits
of
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process
in
terms
of
the
jury's
role.
well,
there
being
no
violation
of
procedural
due
process,
and
it
being
quite
clear
that
the
judgment
below
meets
the
standard
for
substantive
due
process,
it
really
does
seem
to
me
that
this
case
is
not
an
opportunity
for
the
court
to
give
further
guidance
to
the
lower
courts.
and
let
me
just
add
a
word
about
that
issue
of
further
guidance
because
one
of
the
recurring
themes
in
the
petitioner's
submissions
is
somehow
to
recur
to
passion
and
prejudice,
prejudice
against
out-of-staters.
well,
that's
a
red
herring
here.
txo
and
alliance
are
both
texas
corporations.
there's
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
about
that.
passion
and
prejudice,
but
no
real
standards,
nothing
that
would
really
offer
guidance
to
the
lower
courts.
and
i
think
i
know
why.
because
that's
a
fundamentally
legislative
task.
as
the
27
amicus
states
have
made
clear,
in
the
last
few
years,
the
vast
majority
of
the
states
have
responded
to
the
perceived
problems
of
punitive
damages.
10
of
them
have
set
dollar
caps.
12
of
them
have
required
bifurcation
of
the
punitive
phase.
25
of
them
have
required
heightened
standards
of
proof.
unless
this
court
were
to
undertake
the
extraordinary
task,
of
under...
sort
of
doing
that
legislative
business
in
an
even
more
complicated
replication
of
the
labyrinthine
jurisprudence
of
the
death
penalty
cases,
to
really
structure
the
trials
in
these
cases--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
hope
not.
i
gather
some
of
you
are
less
happy
than
others
with
that
labyrinth.
i
would
hope
that
you're
not
tempted
by
this
case
to
do
anything
very
much
because
i
don't
think
that
this
case
is
what
it
was
cracked
up
to
be.
thank
you.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
one
of
their
own
experts
suggested
that
in
those
circumstances,
the
standard
practice
would
be
to
unify
the
title
and
deed
it
back
to
alliance,
but
i
think
it
might
be
harder
to
show,
under
the
body
of
west
virginia
law
that
was
in
place
at
the
time,
that
it
would
have
been
a
violation
of
any
duty
if
they
had
acted
in
a
more
self-interested
way.
but
as
you
say,
clearly
that's
a
state
law
question.
and
what
happened
here
is
really
unmistakable.
they
went
around
trying
to
find
people
who
would
say
that
they
owned
the
oil
and
gas,
and
they
didn't
succeed.
and
when
mr.
signaigo
said
i
won't
sign
that
affidavit,
we
really
know
that
they
were
willing
even
to
suborn
perjury.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
there's
no
question
that
in
general
you're
supposed
to
ask
questions,
but
when
the
answer
is
no,
then
paying
somebody
$6,000
to
say
yes,
which
is
what
they
did
to
virginia
crews,
that's
not
my
understanding
of
ordinary
business
practice.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
it
was
written
in
december.
it
was
written
just
before
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
it
looks
like
it
was
written
with
litigation
in
mind.
and
you
notice
that
the
courts
of
west
virginia
said
there's
no
ambiguity.
paragraph
6
of
the
original
1958
deed,
which
these
other
opinion
letters
studiously
avoided
discussing,
eliminated
any
ambiguity.
it
was
a
ridiculous
theory.
i
find
it
hard
to
take
these
legal
opinions
seriously.
i
don't
mean
to
impugn
the
ethics
of
these
lawyers,
but
it
doesn't
sound
to
me
as
though
this
was
a
genuine
search
for
truth.
thank
you.
