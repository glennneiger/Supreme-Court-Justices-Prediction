is
it
permissible,
mr.
phillips,
to
enter
a
punitive
damages
award
not
only
to
deter
this
actor,
but
other
actors
similarly
situated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
it's
the
marginal
cost
of
wrongdoing
that's
the
limit
on
the
award,
that
that
might
not
have
sufficient
notoriety
or
publicity
to
accomplish
that
effect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
that's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
for
the
jury,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
wait.
that's
all
that
the
jury
was
told
with
reference
to
these
figures?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
as
i
understand
the
way
you
have
calculated
the
$8.3
million
that
you
want
us
to
focus
upon
at
the
high
end,
it
assumes
25
wells,
all
of
which
are
successful,
0
failure
rate.
it
assumes
that
there's
maximum
recovery.
it
gives
no
discount
for
present
value
of
money,
which
is
routine
in,
say,
wage
earner
cases.
and
i
think
this
is
a
highly
exaggerated
figure
that
you're
asking
us
to
rely
upon.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
plus
the
fact,
as
justice
o'connor
put
it,
it
was
never
pointed
out
to
the
jury
or
the
supreme
court
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
that's
why
i
have
trouble
with
the
extrapolations
in
your
brief.
here
in
this
court
is
the
first
time
anybody
has
heard
about
$8.3
million,
which
is
a
very
high
end
figure
in
any
event.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
a
gross
production
figure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
talking
here
about
lost
royalties,
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there
are
other
issues
here
you
want
to
discuss.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
those
persons
who
have
been
punished
for
being
overzealous
on
the
behalf
of
their
clients
would
find
it
rather
difficult
to
understand
why
there's
some
puffing
in
the
figures
before
this
court
which
is
used
to
justify
that
punishment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
aren't
they
supposed
to
do
that
in
order
to
investigate
their
title?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
a
letter
from
a
title
attorney
in
the
last
exhibit
to
the
yellow
brief,
who
indicates
that
this
deed...
mr.
wallace's
letter...
that
this
deed
was
ambiguous
so
far
as
he's
concerned
as
written
to
mr.
skeen.
was
that
written
so
that
mr.
skeen
could
introduce
it
at
trial?
