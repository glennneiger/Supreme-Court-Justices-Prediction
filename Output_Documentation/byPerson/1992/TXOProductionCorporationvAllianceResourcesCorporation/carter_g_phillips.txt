mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
well,
the
court
may
begin
its
opinion
in
this
case
in
much
the
same
way
that
it
began
its
opinion
in
haslip,
that
is,
that
this
case
is
yet
another
challenge
to
a
punitive
damages
award.
to
be
sure,
this
case
does
not
involve
just
any
old
punitive
damages
award.
the
award
here
of
$10
million
for
the
tort
of
slander
of
title
is
beyond
rational
explanation
by
reference
to
any
legitimate
interests
asserted
by
the
state
of
west
virginia
and
is
the
product
of
a
procedural
scheme
that
bore
no
discernable
relationship
to
the
procedural
scheme
that
this
court
reviewed
and
approved
in
haslip.
indeed,
the
west
virginia
supreme
court's
judgment
ultimately
rests
on
a
wholly
arbitrary,
really
mean
versus
really
stupid,
classification
of
defendants
that
even
the
respondents
do
not
defend
in
this
court.
accordingly,
that
judgment
should
be
reversed.
txo
was
an
oil
and
gas
exploration
company
based
in
texas
that
opened
an
office
in
west
virginia
in
the
early
1980's.
in
1984,
it
first
became
interested
in
the
blevins
tract
in
mcdowell
county,
west
virginia,
and
sought
to
obtain
the
oil
and
gas
development
rights
to
that
tract.
those
rights
were
held
by
respondent
tug
fork...
or
excuse
me.
the
title
to
the
oil
and
gas
was
held
by
respondent
tug
fork,
and
the
development
rights
were
held
by
respondent
alliance
resources.
an
agreement
was
reached
between
alliance
and
txo
that
granted
the
latter
the
rights
to
the
development.
txo
received
a
title
opinion
that
indicated
that
there
was
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
1958
deed
had,
in
fact,
conveyed
tug
fork's
interest
to
a
third
party.
the
question
then
was
how
to
resolve
that
problem,
and
txo
obtained
a
quitclaim
deed
from
the
recipient
of
the
rights
in
order
to
be
in
a
position
to
ensure
that
if
it
began
to
drill
well...
drill
a
well
on
that
property
and,
in
fact,
successfully
uncovered
oil
or
gas,
that
it
would
be
able
to
take
that
oil
and
gas
free
of
any
claims
by
this
third
party.
so,
txo
filed
its
quitclaim
deed,
and
then
filed
a
declaratory
judgment
action
seeking
to
have
the
respective
rights
of
the
parties
resolved.
respondents
counterclaimed
in
that
lawsuit
for
slander
of
title
based
solely
on
txo's
action
in
recording
the
quitclaim
deed
and
sought
both
compensatory
damages
and
the
punitive
award.
the
case
was
tried
exclusively
on
respondents'
claim
of
slander
of
title.
respondents
did
not
seek
compensatory
relief
on
any
other
theory
of
the
case,
and
they
did
not
submit
an
instruction
to
the
jury
with
respect
to
any
claim
other
than
the
straight
slander
of
title
claim.
the
jury
was
instructed
with
respect
to
the
punitive
award
that
it
could
enter
an
award
for
three
purposes:
to
punish
the
wrongdoer,
to
serve
as
an
example
to
others
not
to
engage
in
such
conduct,
and
to
provide
unspecified,
quote,
additional
compensation.
and
then
in
arriving
at
a
punitive
amount,
the
jury
should
consider
the
nature
of
the
wrongdoing,
the
extent
of
the
harm
inflicted,
the
intent
of
the
defendant,
the
wealth
of
the
perpetrator,
as
well
as
any
mitigating
factors,
which
were
unspecified
by
the
court.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
meets
all...
well,
actually
what
they
argue
is
that
it
meets
the
standards
that
the
court
sort
of
noted
in
haslip
as
the
green,
alabama
factors.
in
truth,
i
think
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
four
factors
that
the
jury
was
asked
to
look
at,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
jury
could
have
come
to
a
$10
million
verdict
based
on
these
factors.
if
you
consider
the
nature
of
the
wrongdoing,
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
slander
of
title,
nothing
more.
no
physical
injury
was
a
possibility.
we
are
talking
about
a
pure
economic
tort.
the
entire
extent
of
the
injury
that
was
actually
caused
to
the
plaintiffs
as
a
consequence
of
this
particular
economic
activity
was
$19,000.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
certainly
seemed
to
indicate
that,
although
it
is
a
little
difficult
to
understand
on
this
record
on
what
basis
you
would
reach
that
conclusion
in
light
of
the
slander
of
title
claim.
you
will
recall
that
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
there
was--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there
is
no
basis
in
the
jury's
verdict
necessarily
to
find
malice
because
the
jury
was
told
that
it
could
award
punitive
damages
simply
for
reckless
disregard
and
without
malice.
so,
that...
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
as
it
comes
to
this
court,
that
there
is
necessarily
a
jury
finding
of
malice.
there
is
an
appellate
finding.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
no,
of
course
not.
we
don't
lose
the
case
on
that
basis.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
my
basic
point--
[laughter]
we're
in
agreement
on
that,
justice
white.
but
my
basic
point
is
that
as
you
evaluate
the
relationship
of
the
$10
million
award,
which
is
really
where
i
think
you
have
to
start
the
legal
analysis
against
what
is
going
on
here,
in
truth
there
isn't
all
that
much
that
is
going
on
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
even
if
you
accept
that
it
gets
you
over
the
threshold
of
some
punitive
award,
it
certainly
doesn't
take
you
into
the
$10
million
range
for
this
kind
of
tort.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
would
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
also,
however,
conclude
that
if
you
are
looking
to
how
the
jury
got
to
a
$10
million
award
in
this
case,
it
is
quite
clear.
the
question...
the
jury
was
provided
with
evidence
of
the
wealth
of
the
defendant
in
the
case,
txo,
and
was
asked
by
counsel
in
closing
argument
to
award
some
percentage
of
that
wealth
over
as
a
punitive
award,
that
that
would
be
the
fair
way
to
proceed.
and
that
is
the
only
numerical
evidence
in
this
record,
frankly,
that
can
you
get
anywhere
near
$10
million.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the...
if
that
rule,
which
is
obviously
the
rule
that
respondents
in
a
sense
urge
the
court
to
adopt--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right,
and
their...
and
that
is
part
of
their
quest
to
come
up
with
a
number
of
$5
to
$8
million
because
that
is
the
potential
gain.
we
would
still
have
a
problem
with
that
because
you
still
have
an
extraordinary
award
that
is
difficult
to
justify
by
reference
to
the
underlying
conduct
involved
here,
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
is
hard
to
evaluate
it
in
the
abstract.
i
think
there
would
be
a
substantive
problem
that
could
arise
with
that
rule
because
in
a
situation
like
this
where
you
have
a
plaintiff,
defendant
dealing
in
a
particular
transaction,
the
economic
theory
that
tells
you
that
you
are
going
to
deter
this
conduct
says
you
look
at
the
transaction
and
the
actual
profit,
and
you
take
away
all
of
the
actual
profit
and
then
some
multiple
for
any
instances
in
which
engaging
in
this
same
conduct
might
not
actually
be
uncovered.
if
you
do
that,
as
we
explained
in
the
reply
brief,
you
take
away
all
possible
incentive
for
providing...
for
going
forward
with
that
kind
of
conduct,
and
you
should,
thereby,
completely
deter.
our
position
is
whenever
you
get
to
the
point
where
you
have
put
in
all
that
retribution
permits
and
you
put
in
all
that
deterrence
will
permit
and
you
go
beyond
that,
that
then
you
are,
in
effect,
punishing
the
innocent.
so,
there
is
a
substantive
problem
even
at
that
level.
the
difficulty,
obviously,
is
where
you
draw
the
line,
and
if
you
had
a
situation,
like
you
pose,
where
a
legislature
has
come
in
and
tried
to
make
some
kind
of
an
assessment,
i
suspect
the
court
ought
quite
rightly
to
be
somewhat
deferential
in
how
it
evaluates
whether
or
not
you've
still
crossed
that
line.
but
i
think
there
is
still
an
excessiveness
problem.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
i
don't
think
it
would
make
any
difference
if
it
were
a
common
law
rule.
i'm
not...
this
is
not
a
notice
problem.
i
still
think
you
have
a
problem
of
excessiveness.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
clearly
wouldn't
have
had
any
notice
of
it
because
this
is
an
argument
that
didn't
arise
until
the
briefs
in
this
court.
we
were
never
tried
on
that
basis
in
the
courts
below.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
at
the
time
of
the
trial?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
or
at
the
time
of
the
conduct
at
issue?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
sort
of
difficult...
at
that
stage
in
the
process,
to
be
sure,
the
procedures
were
less
well
formulated
than
they
have
since
become,
but
to
the
extent
that
garnes,
the
decision
of
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
subsequent
to
this
court's
decision
in
haslip,
reflects
basically
the
west
virginia
supreme
court's
analysis
of
the
appropriate
inquiry
that
ought
to
be
undertaken,
the
rules
presumably
would
have
been
quite
favorable
as
they
ultimately
played
out.
we
just
weren't
the
beneficiary
of
any
of
those
rules
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
you
could
clearly
have...
there's
no
quarrel
about
whether
or
not
a
punitive
award
could
be
imposed
in
a
particular
circumstance.
the
question
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
that
would
be
fine.
my
problem
with
the
notice
issue...
there's
a
different
notice
issue
involved
with
respect
to
the
potential
gain
theory
that
the
respondents
put
forward
here,
which
is
that
wasn't
the
theory
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
at
the
time
of
the
conduct.
that
wasn't
the
theory
put
forward
by
the
trial
court
in
the
instructions
to
the
jury.
the
instructions
to
jury
say
harm
inflicted,
not
potential
gain
to
the
defendant.
that
was
not
the
theory
on
which
the
matter
was
defended
in
the
trial
court
and
post-judgment.
that
was
not
the
theory
on
which
the
decision
was
defended
in
the
west
virginia
supreme
court,
and
now
it
comes
here.
the
other
part
of
the
problem
with
this
argument,
as
it
comes
to
this
court
is,
there
is
no
evidence
that
would
support
an
expected
gain
analysis
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
what
you
don't
do--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it's
the
timing
of
adopting
the
theory
of
punitive
damages.
you
don't...
after
the
jury,
which
is
supposedly
the
sentencer
in
this
context,
you
say
to
the
jury
this
is
the
basis
on
which
you
should
decide
how
much
money
to
take
from
the
defendant,
okay.
and
they
make
a
$10
million
award
on
a
set
of
facts.
you
don't
then
come
back
in
and
say
if
we
took
those
facts,
as
it
comes
to
us,
if
we
take
it
on
its
own
terms,
we
could
not
conceive
of
getting
to
$10
million.
but
even
though
the
jury
never
had
this
in
front
of
it,
even
though
it
could
not
conceivably
have
based
the
award
on
this,
we
will
now
come
in
and
urge
you
to
affirm
that
verdict
on
that
basis.
if
this
had
been
the
issue
in
front
of
the
jury,
we
would
have
tried
that
issue
and
the
expected
gain
would
not
have
been
anywhere
near
the
fabricated
number
that
respondents'
counsel
put
forward.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
and
a
procedural
trial
problem.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
we
brought
this
case
on
the
theory
that
the
west
virginia
courts
imposed
the
verdict
on
us,
and
we
defended
it
and
presented
it
to
the
court
under
those
terms
because
it
may
be
a
narrow
theory,
but
it's
an
important
one.
the
question
here
is,
is
there
a
limit
based
on
excessiveness?
and
if
this
court
holds
that
as
tried
before
the
west
virginia
courts--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
but
that
still
requires
you
to
make
an
analysis
of
whether
there's
a
reasonable
means-ends
fit
in
this
case,
as
the
case
was
tried,
as
the
jury
had
the
evidence.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
see,
i
think
the
reason
for
the
way
we
view
this
i
suppose
in
somewhat
different
terms
is
we
came
to
the
case
with
what
was
in
front
of
us
in
west
virginia
and
brought
that
to
the
court's
attention
as
an
important
issue
on
its
own
terms.
the
respondents,
because
they
cannot
defend
the
issue
as
it
comes
on
its
own
terms,
have
now
tried
significantly
to
shift
the
court's
focus
from
the
way
it
was
decided
below.
in
responding
to
that
point,
what
i
am
suggesting
to
you
is
that
there
are
procedural
obstacles
to
taking
into
account
that
argument.
i'm
not
saying...
and
we
have
never
argued
categorically
that
you
cannot
have
a
$10
million
punitive
damage
award.
there's
certainly
going
to
be
a
lot
of
instances
in
which
that
would
be
an
appropriate
award
in
a
particular
case.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
for
slander
of
title
with
no
potential
harm,
with
gross
over-deterrence
as
the
ultimate
effect
of
the
$10
million
verdict,
this
court
ought
to
declare
that,
under
these
circumstances,
that
award
is
excessive,
and
therefore
violates
substantive
due
process.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
to
other
victims.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
that...
to
my
mind
that
reflects
more
the
passion
and
prejudice
problem
that's
inherent
in
the
bad
acts
evidence
that
was
put
into
this
case
because
if
you
read
that
language
carefully,
it
cannot
possibly
be
that
he
reaches
that
conclusion
based
on
the
slander
of
title
claim
in
west
virginia
alone
because
he's
talking
about
a
pattern
of
fraud.
well,
a
slander
of
title
case,
even
if
done
maliciously,
doesn't
constitute
a
pattern
of
fraud.
it's
a
single
point.
so,
in
order
to
get
to
a
pattern
of
fraud,
you
have
to
go
to
all
the
bad
acts
evidence
that
was
brought
in
and
say
that
somehow
all
of
that
can
be
used
to
upgrade
the
quantity
of
the
punitive
award.
and
our
position
is
that
all
is
way
beyond
the
jurisdiction
of
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
to
take
into
account--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
could
not
have
been
the
basis
for
the
jury's
verdict.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
it
would
be
perfectly
acceptable
for
that
inquiry
to
be
undertaken
on
remand
after
this
verdict
is
set
aside.
go
back
to
the
jury,
start
over
again,
if
they
wish
to,
see
whether
or
not...
see,
one
of
the
problems
you've
got,
if
you
go
back
to
a
new
jury,
is
garnes...
in
the
garnes
case,
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
exhaustively
analyzed
what
factors
ought
to
go
into
the
determination
of
an
appropriate
jury
award.
and
you
will
look
in
vain
in
that
opinion
for
an
expected
gain
theory
like
the
one
put
forward
by
the
respondents
in
this
case.
and
there's
good
reason,
for
the
reasons
i
was
trying
to
explain
to
justice
souter.
it
is
a
grossly
over-deterring
method
of
imposing
a
punitive
award,
and
so
there's
no
reason
in
the
world
to
assume
at
this
point
that
west
virginia
would
adopt
that
kind
of
an
approach
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
so,
it
may
be...
you
know,
i
have
no
quarrel.
if
they
want
to
go
back
on
retrial,
try
to
put
in
that
evidence,
it
will
show
that
the
expected
gain
is
nowhere
near
what
they
project
in
their
briefs.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
this
record
doesn't
indicate
anything
about
what
the
expected
gain
would
have
been
because
it
wasn't
an
issue
in
the
case.
there
are
some
snippets
of
exhibit
numbers
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--we
couldn't
even
begin
to
know
whether
or
not
those
are
wild
projections,
whether
they
really
went
into
anybody's
calculations
on
any
of
this
stuff.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
think
you
could
punish
them
for
the
potential
injury
to
the
others
in
other
states.
i
think
you
could
derive
from
the
facts
something
about
the
nature
of
the
entity,
and
you
might
even
be
able
to
figure
out
something
about
what
would
be
necessary
as
a
deterrence
matter
in
west
virginia
if
you
can
come
up
with
some
kind
of
a
nexus
between
the
two.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
but
i
mean,
it's
clearly
not
the
only
opportunity.
there's
always
the
opportunity
for
those
who
are
down
in
those
states
to
bring
those
kinds
of
actions.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
west
virginia...
simply
because
west
virginia
saw
bad
acts
in
texas,
i
don't
see
that
it
can
reach
down
and
exercise
jurisdiction
over
those
bad
acts
even
if
it
has
a
case--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
difference
in
that
is
that
when
you
get
in
the
criminal
sentencing
process,
you
have
some
set
guidelines
and
you
have--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
a
civil
proceeding.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
in
civil
proceeding--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
would
be
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
but
in
a
civil
proceeding,
what
you're
talking
about...
and
remember
what
he
says.
the
language
is
harm
to
victims
as
a
monetary
amount
in
other
states
based
on
other
acts,
frankly.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
see,
my
problem
with
this
is
that
when
you're
in
a
situation
where
we
are
orders
of
magnitude
beyond
anything
that
anyone
else
has
ever
permitted
with
a
particular
punitive
award...
and
as
we
explain
in
the...
in
our
brief,
we've
already
demonstrated
that
we
are
orders
of
magnitude
outside...
one
of
the
genuine
fears
you
have
to
have
is
this
a
product
of
passion
and
prejudice,
and
that
bad
acts
evidence,
as
used
in
this
context
does
create
passion
and
prejudice.
and
the
best
evidence
of
it
is
the
west
virginia
supreme
court's
own
opinion.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
it
clearly
plays
a
role
in
the
sense--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
because
you
can
demonstrate
the
malice.
you
can
demonstrate
a
certain
amount
of
knowledge
and,
therefore,
demonstrate
two
things
i
think
from
it.
one
is
that
some
greater
amount
will
be
required
to
deter
this
actor
in
the
future
because
of
what
we
know
from
other
acts,
and
two,
that
this
actor...
it's
not
just
a
mistake
here,
that
this
really
is
a
bad
actor,
and
therefore
some
additional
amount
would
be
required
as
a
consequence
of
that.
what
i
had--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--oh,
of
course.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
think
it
probably
would
be
impermissible
under
those
circumstances,
but
the...
you
know,
of
course,
the
problem
is,
is
that
what
you're
talking
about
there
is
an
undertaking
that
we
clearly
embrace,
which
is
that
you
initially
have
to
examine
sort
of
what
the
nature
of
the
award
is.
is
it
off
the
charts?
has
it
fallen
beyond
what
is
by
all
objective
measures
impermissible?
if
it
is,
then
you
have
to
justify
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
it
would
be
if
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
would
be
probably.
if
you
end
up
with
a
number
that's
way
off
for
the
slander
of
title
and
you
looked
and
tried
to
compare
it,
you'd
say,
geez,
this
number
is
nowhere
near
what
we
would
have
expected
for
this
kind
of
an
offense
anywhere.
and
then
you
can
look
in
the
record,
if
there
is
such
a
record,
for
what
is
unique
about
this
case
that
might
justify
that
award.
and
that
way
you
do
permit
the
common
law
to
continue
to
develop
without
being
completely
constrained
by
the
constitution.
but
we're
nowhere
near
that
because
we...
there's
nothing
specific
to
txo
that
would
allow
you
to
get
from
what
would
be
the
ordinary
kinds
of
multiples
that
ought
to
be
applied
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
kennedy,
it
is
permissible.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
think
you've
still
got
to
be
limited
by
the
nature
of
what
is
it
that
you're
trying
to
deter
here,
and
what
we're
trying
to
deter
here
is
the
reckless
recordation
of
quitclaim
deeds,
which
is
hardly
something
that
requires
a
huge
amount
of
notoriety
for
the
purpose
of
trying
to
get
others
not
to
do
it.
you
don't
need
a
$10
million
award
to
tell
a
land
man
and
his
title
counsel,
the
next
time
he's
got
a
problem
with
title,
to
act
cautiously
in
trying
to
resolve
that
title.
and,
indeed,
a
$10
million
award
in
a
case
like
this
is
going
to
place
the
fear
of
god
into
those
people
and
thereby
create
way
over-deterrence
and
cause
even
more
trouble--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
terms
of
oil
and
gas
development.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
at
some
point,
i
think
it
isn't
for
the
jury.
at
some
point,
if
the
state's
reason
for
having
a
punitive
damages
system
is
to
deter
and
to
punish
and
what
you've
done
is
effectively
grossly
over-deterred,
then
you'll
have,
in
effect,
gone
way
beyond
the
ends
permissible
by
the
state
and
therefore
the
means
are
invalid.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
what
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
knew
it
when
i
saw
it
here,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
right
test,
justice
o'connor.
[laughter]
the
test
is
that
you
look
first
at
the
gravity
of
the
offense,
and
you
look
at
the
nature
of
what
kind
of
deterrence
would
be
necessary.
you
compare
it
to
the
objective
criteria
in
sort
of
solem
versus
helm's
like
analysis
to
see
is
this
objectively
unreasonable.
at
that
point,
that
should
trigger
two
separate
inquiries.
one
is
is
there
a
basis
for
believing
that
this
was
the
product
of
passion
and
prejudice.
the
use
of
wealth
in
this
case
clearly
caused
passion
and
prejudice.
the
use
of
other
bad
acts
clearly
caused
passion
and
prejudice,
and
the
repeated
references
to
out-of-state
defendants,
compared
to
in-state
plaintiffs
created
passion
and
prejudice
in
this
case.
the
other
thing
you
can
look
for
then
is
what
state
justifications
exist
specific
to
this
defendant
that
would
justify
the
award
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
no
such
exists.
respondents
have
tried
to
bring
some
in,
but
they
weren't
adjudicated
below.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
just
address
a
couple
of
points
here.
first
of
all,
you
will
notice
that
again,
there
is
no
defense
of
the
punitive
award
on
the
terms
that
it
was
imposed
by
the
jury
and
upheld
by
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
in
this
case.
indeed,
i
think
mr.
tribe
revealed
quite
plainly
that
he
cannot
defend
it
on
that
ground,
that
he
has
to
find
some
other
ground
by
which
to
justify
this
award
and
then
invokes
nordlinger
v.
hahn
to
justify
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
is
a
huge
difference
for
courts
because
the
punishment
was
imposed
by
the
jury,
and
what
trying
to
sustain
the
jury's
verdict
on
a
ground
not
in
front
of
the
jury
does
is
ignore
the
potential
of
passion
and
prejudice
that
undergirds
the
jury's--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
think
procedural
and
substantive
due
process
merge
here,
justice
scalia.
i'm
not...
i
am
not
here
to
defend
across
the
board
the
possibility
that
$10
million
verdicts
can
never
be
entered
in
any
kind
of
case.
what
i
am
here
to
say
is
that
the
$10
million
verdict
in
this
case
is
grossly
excessive,
and
if
this
court
has
meant
what
it
said
in
the
past,
that
grossly...
that
a
state
is
no
more
permitted
to
assess
a
grossly
excessive
damage
award
than
it
is
to
impose
a
grossly
excessive
fine,
this
is
the
case
that
tests
the
limits
of
that.
and
if
you
go
back
and
examine
with
care
the
precise
items
that
mr.
tribe
has
gone
through
and
look
at
the
jury
instructions,
if
they
thought
they
had
tried
this
case
on
a
potential
gain
theory
throughout
the
entire
proceedings,
wouldn't
it
have
been
reasonable
to
expect
that
when
they
proposed
a
jury
instruction
that
it
would
have
said
you
must
measure
this
by
the
potential
gain
rather
than
by
the
harm
actually
inflicted?
it's
clear
that
this
was
not
tried
on
that
particular
theory.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
even...
but
that...
i
don't
think
you
can
reincorporate
into
other...
into
the
deterrence
rationale,
which
is
the
rationale
that
you're
supposed
to
follow,
these
elements
which
decide
the
amount
of
the
award.
this
is
what
describes
how
you
get
to
$10
million.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
if
you
defined
it
in
those
terms
for
the
jury,
that
might
be,
but
there
is
simply
nothing
in
what
the
jury
was
asked
to
do
to
look
at
potential
gain.
all
it
was
asked
to
do
was
look
at
actual
profit
and
actual
harm,
and
on
that
basis,
there
is
no
way
that
you
can
get
to
$10
million.
the
only
way
you
get
to
$10
million
is
because
of
the
wealth
of
txo
and
the
decision
to
impose
a
1
percent
penalty.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
was
originally
put
into
the
case
because
there
was
at
one
stage
a
claim
that
they
were
going
to
make
that
there
was
a
bad
faith
dealing
here
in
that
when
we
capped
the
well,
we
actually
deprived
them
of
a
significant
amount
of
money.
that
was
a
separate
element.
it
wasn't
a
separate
cause
of
action,
but
it
was
a
separate
element
of
the
case.
that
evidence
was
brought
in
for
that
purpose
to
give
some
measure
to
that
because
they
didn't
have
access
to
the
specific
numbers.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
and
it
was
abandoned.
that
claim
was
specifically
abandoned
in
the
middle
of
trial,
mr.
justice
white.
