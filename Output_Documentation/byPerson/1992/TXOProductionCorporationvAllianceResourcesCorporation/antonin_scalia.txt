of
course,
on
that
theory,
you
can
never
develop
a
common
law
of
punitive
damages
because
the
first
case
would
be
unconstitutional,
there
being
no
notice
of
it.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--without
notice.
you're
dealing
with
a
bad
actor
who
has
committed
an
intentional
tort,
and
a
common
law
court
says
for
the
first
time,
we
are
going
to
adopt
within
this
jurisdiction
a
theory
of
punitive
damages.
that
would
be
okay,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
the
new
adoption
of
a
theory
any
worse
than
the
new
adoption
of
the
whole
doctrine?
suppose
there
had
been...
never
been
a
punitive
damages
case
in
west
virginia
before,
although
there
had
been
in
other
jurisdictions.
and
it
comes
before
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
and
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
says,
yes,
we
adopt
the
theory
of
punitive
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it...
why
is
adopting
a
theory
of
punitive
damages
any
worse
than
adopting
the
whole
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
notice
problem.
it's
not
notice
at
the
time
of
your
conduct.
it's
a
jury
instruction
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
tempt
us,
mr.
tribe.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he...
but
he's
responding
to
your
substantive
due
process
argument.
if...
your
procedural
due
process
argument
would,
indeed,
say,
well,
it
has
to
be
upheld
on
the
same
ground
that
was
proposed.
but
for
substantive
due
process,
isn't
he
right
that
so
long
as
it
is
sustainable
on
some
rational
basis?
that's
what
we
do
for
legislatures.
why
is
it
any
different
for
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
procedural
due
process
it
seems
to
me,
not
substantive
due
process.
