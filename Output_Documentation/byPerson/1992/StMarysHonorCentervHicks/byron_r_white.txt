justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you
one
thing?
if
the
employer
in
a
case
like
this,
after
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
made,
just
remains
quiet
or
he
doesn't
offer
any
allegedly
neutral
ground,
is
the
plaintiff
entitled
to
judgment
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
if
the
employer
offers
on
its
face
a
neutral
reason
and
the
plaintiff
fails
to
prove
that
it's
a
farce,
the
case
is
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
mean
the
employer
then
is
entitled
to
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
the
plaintiff
proves
pretext--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
you
think
he's...
it's
not
over.
he's
in
worse
position
than
he
would
have
been
if
the
employer
had
stayed
quiet.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he...
did
he...
did
the
district
trial
court
find
pretext
that
the
offered
reason
was
pretextual?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
you
wouldn't
mind
having
that
rule
i
don't
suppose.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
you...
what
do
you
object
in
the
court...
to
in
the
court
of
appeals
judgment?
namely,
that
the
district
court
was...
it
was
improper
for
him,
for
the
district
court
judge,
to
rule
for
the
plaintiff
just
because
there
was
a
finding
of
pretext.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
of
course,
we're
reviewing
the
court
of
appeals
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
defending
that
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
pretext
means
it's
a
lie?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
it
would
be...
is
it...
or
does
pretext
really
just
mean
that
there
was
another
reason?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
a
trial
judge
in
a
case
like
this
could
reserve
his
judgment
on...
reserve
his
ruling
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
do
you
think
that...
don't
judges
sometimes
rule
on
the
motion
although
they
think
we
really
are
going
to...
we
really
don't
think
it's
much
of
a
prima
facie
case,
and
we
may
ultimately
decide
the
case
because
the
plaintiff's
case
was
deficient?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
making
just
a
ruling
that
there's
a
prima
facie
case
doesn't
necessarily
end
the
factfinder's
task.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
in
the
course
of
cross-examining
the
defendant's
witnesses,
in
order
to
prove
pretext,
the...
it
turns
out
that
there
was
personal
animosity?
do
you
think
just
because
the
defendant...
the
plaintiff
proves
pretext
by
that
evidence,
that
it's
entitled
to
judgment
and
that
the
court
is
disentitled
to
say,
well,
it
may
be
pretext,
but
there
really
is
a
neutral
reason,
a
race-neutral
reason,
for
the
discharge?
is
a
court
forbidden
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
your
answer
is
yes,
the
court--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes,
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
say
that
i
think
to
support
your
theory
of
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i...
if
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
on
its
theory,
it
sounds
to
me
like
it...
you
would
all...
you
would
still
win
because
there
wouldn't
be
enough
evidence
to
support
the
finding
of
animus.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
you
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
district
court
was
wrong
in...
that...
in
ruling
on
the
basis
of
animus
because
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
of
it?
