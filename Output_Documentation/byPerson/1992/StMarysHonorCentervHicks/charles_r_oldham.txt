mr.
charles
r.
oldham
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
gardner
and
i
are
in
substantial
disagreement
about
the
facts
and
substantial
disagreement
about
what
the
court
below
held,
the
district
court
held.
in
regard
to
the
issue
of
personal
animosity--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--i
understand,
your
honor,
but
he--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--i'm
defending
that
judgment.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
and
i
just
wanted
to
point
out
just
one
fact
that
what
the
district
court
held
that
plaintiff
had
failed
to
prove
that
personal
animus
was
not
the
true
reason.
that's
what
the
district
court
held.
what
happened
in
this
situation,
we
proved
the
prima
facie
case.
the
employer
came
forward
with
his
two
reasons,
the
severity
of
the...
the
number
of
disciplinary
actions
in
a
short
period
of
time
and
severity
of
a
provoked
confrontation
between
mr.
powell
and
mr.
hicks.
then
the
court
went
on
to
find
that
these
reasons
were
pretextual,
and
then
ignored
i
think
the
mandates
of
green
and
burdine.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
it's
false.
i
think
that
he
gave
false
reasons.
that's
a
lie,
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
as
i
understand
pretext,
the
way
we
use
pretext
it's
false.
it
is
not
the
true
reason,
that
they
advanced
a
reason
which
was
not
accurate,
which
was
not
true,
which
substantially
amounts
to
it
was
a
lie
in
this
particular
case.
it
was
not
the
reason
he
was
discharged.
and
the
problem
that
mr.
gardner
has,
and
he
admits,
that
if
we
prove
a
prima
facie
case
and
if
the
defendant
or
employer
remains
silent,
we're
entitled
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law.
he
next...
go
to
the
next
step.
if
we
offer
a
false
reason--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--they
often
do
that,
judge.
they
often
defer
the
ruling
on
the
motion
to
dismiss.
they
hear
the
entire
case,
and
then
they
make
the
decision
on
the...
whether
or
not
there
should
have
been
a
directed
verdict
in
the
first
place.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
your
honor,
because
usually
in
a
jury
trial
case--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--no,
it
does
not
necessarily
end
the
factfinder's
task
when
the
person
comes
forward
with
an
articulated,
nondiscriminatory
reason.
if
he
doesn't...
if
he
stands
mute,
makes
no
statement
at
all,
i
think
it's
clear
that
under
burdine
he's...
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
a
judgment.
that's
the
ruling
in
burdine.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
that's
right,
your
honor.
when
you
try
a
case,
you
don't
try
it
in
this
three-stage
step
like
this.
we
try
it
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
in
a
chronological
state.
we
present
our
evidence
and
we...
at
the
time
you're
trying
the
case,
you
will
probably
present
some
evidence
of
pretext
because
the
employer
has
already
articulated
in
some
manner
or
another,
as
was
done
in
this
case,
his
stated
reasons
for
the
action
taken,
for
the
employment
decision.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
i
can
call
the
employer
as
a
witness.
in
this
case
we
actually
had
documents
which
spelled
out
the
specific
reasons
for
the
actions
taken,
and
they
were
part
of
the
exhibits
in
the
case.
and
so
that
this
was
part
of
the
pretrial
discovery.
the...
essentially
what
the
state
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
modify
greatly
the
holdings
in
green
and
burdine.
you
know,
some
20
years
ago
green
was
argued
in
front
of
this
court
and
there
was
a
unanimous
decision.
and
the
court
looked
at
the
civil
rights
act
and
said
we
want
to
stop
discrimination,
overt
and
subtle.
and
then
they
devised
a
method
of
proving
discrimination,
and
it's
by
indirect
evidence.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
did
that
modify
green
and
burdine
in
this
specific
area?
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
that's
true,
your
honor.
the
holding
is
that
once
the
employer
comes
forward
with
a
legitimate,
nondiscriminatory
reason,
that
that
rebuts
the
presumption
of
the--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--that
rebuts
the
presumption,
and
that
presumption
drops
from
the
case.
however,
the
evidence
remains.
the
evidence
remains
on
the
inferences
that
can
be
legally
drawn
from
that
evidence
remains
in
the
case.
our
position
is
that
you
start
out,
as
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
with
a
green/mcdonnell
douglas
format,
where
you
start
out
with
all
sorts
of
possible
reasons
for
the
actions
taken.
the
plaintiff
claims
it
was
discrimination.
you
prove
the
prima
facie
case
which
eliminates
some
of
the
reasons,
and
then
the
employer
is
required
to
come
forward
and
articulate
the
nondiscriminatory
reasons.
now,
after
he
has
articulated,
that
narrows
the
focus
down
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
these
reasons
are
true
or
not
true.
once
you
prove
pretext,
all
you
have
left
on
one
side
is
discrimination
and
the
false
reasons
given
by
the
employer.
and
my
position
is
and
the
position
that
we
have
taken
is
that
this
entitles
us
to
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
in--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--he
must
rely
upon
the
articulated
legitimate
and
nondiscriminatory
reasons.
the
purpose
of
the
whole
thing
is
to
focus
and
narrow
the
inquiry
from
all
possible
reasons
down
to
the
ones
that
the
employer
says
he
relied
upon.
once
you
prove
they're
false--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--i
think
that
this
is
fairly
unique,
your
honor,
because
of
the
prodigy
of
green,
burdine,
furnco,
and
all
the
cases
that
have
followed,
which
are
a
product
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
where
the
congress
declared
it
was
one
of
the
highest
priorities
that
we
had
was
to
eliminate
discrimination,
both
overt
and
subtle.
and
in
furnco,
this
court
recognized
that
it's
kind
of
hard
to
get
into
the
minds
of
individuals,
that
you
have
to
devise
a
method
of
reaching
the
results
of
proving
discrimination.
and
the
court
has
devised
this
process
of
proving
discrimination,
and
this
is
what
we
followed
when
we
tried
this
hicks
case.
we
used--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
shifts.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
your
honor,
if
the
state
or
the
employer
doesn't
project
or
articulate
the
legitimate,
nondiscriminatory
reasons,
it
is
our
position
that
the
trier
of
fact
shouldn't
search
the
record
and
come
up
with
his
own
articulated
reasons,
that
the
articulation
is
the
responsibility
of
the
employer.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
if
the
plaintiff
makes
an
admission
that
the
reason
for
the
discharge
was
nondiscriminatory--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
burdine
test
requires
the
employer
to
articulate
the
reasons.
and
we
have
to
have
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
meet
those
reasons.
and
so,
i
would
say
that
if
evidence
is
brought
forth,
it
might
go
to
the
issue
of
pretext,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
defeat
the
plaintiff's
case.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
you
can
have
evidence
come
from
the
defendant
that's
favorable
for
the
plaintiff.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
your
honor,
i
still
go
back
to
the
requirements
in
burdine--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
see
how
a--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--the
plaintiff
is
going
to
have
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
meet
the
allegations
of
the
employer,
the
nondiscriminatory
reasons
announced
by
the
employer,
unless
he
has
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
meet
those.
and
in
this
situation,
i
don't
agree
that
that
happened,
but
i
understand
the
hypothetical.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
your
honor,
this
is
different
from
a
negligence
case.
this
is
a
race
case
which
has
brought
about
by
specific
legislation
of
congress
which
was
designed
to
defeat
and
change
certain
patterns
of--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--all
i
know
is,
judge,
is
that
in
green
and
versus
burdine...
green
and
burdine,
the
court
did
set
up
a
method
of
indirect
proof
and
a
specific
process
which
this
court
has
recognized
for
long
periods
of
time,
and
i
think
that
it
is
unique.
it's
a
little
different
from
a
negligence
case.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
well--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--i
think
that
the
court
is
bound
by
the
issues
that
are
projected
by
the
parties.
that's
not
unusual
at
all
to
say
that--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
judge,
he
did
not.
the
first
time
that
personal
animosity
was
mentioned,
it
was
january
1984
until
january
of
1991
when
the
decision
came
down.
prior
to
that
time,
there
had
been
no
mention
of
personal
animosity
except
the
statement
of
mr.
powell
that
there's
nothing
personal.
when
he
was
asked
if
there
were
any
difficulties
between
him
and
the
plaintiff,
mr.
powell
said
there's
nothing
personal.
that's
the
only
evidence
there
is
that's
in
the
case.
that
case
says
that
mr.
powell
said
there
was
nothing
personal.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
yes,
i
did,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
no,
i
didn't,
your
honor,
because
i
felt
that
the...
under
the
mcdonnell
douglas/burdine
test
that
the
employer
was
required
to
articulate
the
nondiscriminatory
reasons
to
give
me
a
fair
opportunity
to
meet
those.
i
wasn't
in
a
position
to
meet
every
possible
facet
that
might
arise
in
a
case
whether
or
not
he
was
absent--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
i've
had
cases,
judge,
where
we've
tried
it
and
we
fully
tried
a
issue
other
than
the
issue
that
was
originally
focused,
and
there
was
a
motion
made
to
amend
the
pleadings
after
the
trial.
that's
very
rarely
done.
it's
only
when
there
has
been
a
full
trial
on
those
issues,
and
here
we
did
not
have
a
full
trial
on
that
issue.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
that's
true,
your
honor.
that's
true.
that
did
not
happen
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
well,
i
will
point
out
to
the
court
that
we
did
raise
issues
of
a
fact
that
one
of
the
complaints
had
to
do
with
retaliation,
and
that
wasn't
ruled
upon.
that...
another
complaint
had
to
do
with
the
fact
that
we
alleged
there
were
errors
in
certain
findings
of
fact--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--that's
correct,
and
actually
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
that
and
said
it
was
wrong
for
the
district
court
to
assume,
without
any
evidence
to
support
it,
that
there
was
animus
involved.
we
raised
that
point,
but
the
court
did
not
rule
on
that
issue.
it
ruled
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
judgment
is
compelled.
and
we
believe
that
that
was
a
right
ruling
under
burdine
and
a
right
ruling
under
green,
and
that
this
court
should
sustain
that
decision.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
that's
possible,
your
honor.
but
i
think
it's
important
that
we
set
a
procedure
which
trial
attorneys,
everybody
else,
employers
can
rely
upon
in
terms
of
determining
how
you
go
about
proving
discrimination.
do
we
have
to
add
an
additional
step
that
many
of
the
courts
have
not
recognized
in
terms
of
pretext
plus
or
can
we
rely
upon
pretext
as
a
means
of
obtaining
a
proof
of
discrimination
and--
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
--that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
r.
oldham
that
is
correct.
thank
you
very
much.
