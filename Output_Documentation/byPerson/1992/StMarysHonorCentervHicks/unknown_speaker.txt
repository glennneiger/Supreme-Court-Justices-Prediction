unknown

thank
you,
mr.
oldham.
unknown
speaker
well,
to
say
that
he
can...
the
plaintiff
can
carry
the
burden
to
me
means
nothing
more
than
the
finder
of
fact
would
be
justified
in
ruling
in
his
favor.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
but
you're
proposing
going
beyond
that.
i
mean,
what
you're
saying
is
not
only
that
he
may
prove
it
that
way,
but
that
it
must
constitute
proof,
that
the
trier
of
fact
must
accept
that
as
adequate.
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far
to
solve
the
problem
you
were
just
talking
about,
but
you
do
contend
that
it
goes
all
the
way
and
it
says
the
trier
of
fact
must
make
that
finding.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
you
think
burdine
holds
that.
unknown
speaker
and
what
other
case?
unknown
speaker
aikens
said,
as
i
recall,
when
all
the
evidence
is
in,
we...
these
presumptions
are
not
nearly
as
important.
we
simply
try
to
decide
was
there
discrimination
here.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
question
about
the
way
he
can
prove
it,
but
what
you're
arguing
is
that
certain
elements
brought
forth
by
the
plaintiff
not
only
permit
a
finding
by
the
finder
of
fact,
but
it
requires
them.
i
don't
think
aikens
said
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
do
have...
i
mean,
these
cases
are
tried
under
the
same
sort
of
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
that
other
cases
are
tried
under,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
and
you
have
a
complaint
and
an
answer.
i
suppose
a
defendant
might
in
the
form
of
his
answer
waive
certain...
but
if
the
defendant
simply
denies
generally
that
he
discriminated
and
he
has
never
been
pinned
down
by
any
interrogatories
or
depositions,
why
should
it
be
different
than
any
other
kind
of
case?
i
mean,
i
get
the
impression
from
hearing
your
co-counsel
and
you
as
if
at
each
point
after
a
witness
testified
in
one
of
these
cases,
the
counsel
must
stand
up
and
say,
well,
now
this
witness
proved
this,
and
that's
just
not
the
way
cases
are
tried.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
defendant
files
an
answer
to
the
title
vii
complaint
denying
generally
that
it
discriminated
and
that
is
never
further
amplified
by
deposition
discovery?
now,
at
the
time
of
trial,
why
should
that
suddenly
be
transformed
into
something
that's
quite
different
than
is
set
out
by
the
pleadings?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
what
you're
saying
is
more
than
that.
you're
saying
that
if
the
defendant...
if
witnesses
testify
that
these
were
the
reasons
that
the
plaintiff
was
fired,
they
were
nondiscriminatory,
that
those
and
only
those
can
be
considered
by
the
finder
of
fact
even
though
there
was
a
general
denial
in
the
answer.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
pleadings.
that's
the
point
of
the
pleadings.
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't...
isn't
that
contained
ordinarily
in
the
burden
of
proof?
if
you
have
to
prove
element
a,
you
have
to
exclude
other
hypotheses.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
dumont,
we
don't
know
if
that's
how
the
court
of
appeals
would...
whether
the
court
of
appeals
would
sustain
that
finding
of
the
district
court.
i
thought
our
inquiry
here
was
just
whether
it's
a
mandatory
presumption
or
a
permissive
one
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case.
i
thought
that
was
all
we
had
to
decide.
unknown
speaker
then
why
can't
it
just
be
a
permissive
one?
all
that
evidence
and
the
inferences
from
it
are
still
available
to
the
plaintiff/employee
at
the
end
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
don't
know
whether
it's
nothing
else.
the
district
court
thought
there
was
something
else,
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
really
face
up
to
that.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
one
problem
we
have
in
these
cases
is
that
causes
are
not
always
clear.
it
may
be
that
this
person
was
late.
it
may
be
that
he
did
have
disciplinary
problems.
it
may
be
that
those
were
partial
underlying
causes,
but
it
may
be
that
the
substantial
cause
for
the
firing
was
something
that
the
court
figures
out
in
retrospect
in
a
way
that
even
the
employer
himself
or
itself
could
not
ascertain
with
great
accuracy.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
to
say
that
there's
a
pretext
only
when
there's
a
lie
is
inconsistent
with
the
way
civil
trials
usually
proceed.
