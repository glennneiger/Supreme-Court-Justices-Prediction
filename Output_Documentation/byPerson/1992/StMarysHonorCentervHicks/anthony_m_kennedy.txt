well,
i
take
it
the
concomitant
of
the
rule
is
that
the
presumption
would
not
drop
out
of
the
case
altogether.
the
employee,
under
at
least
one
formulation,
might
be
entitled
to
always
go
to
the
finder
of
fact
once
he
had
a
prima
facie
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we
could
also
say
i
suppose,
if
we're
just
making
up
rules,
that
the
burden
continues
to
rest
on
the
employer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof
once
a
prima
facie
case
has
been
shown.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
there's
an
undercurrent
in
this
case
that
the
employer
is
not
bound
by
what
it
says.
it's
really
a
rather
unremarkable
principle
to
say
that
a
party
is
bound
by
his
own
proof,
isn't
it?
aren't
we
departing
from
that
somewhat
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
so
that
i
understand
your
position,
though,
may
i
ask
were
those
two
items
of
evidence
that
you
mentioned,
the
hicks
testimony
and
i
think
the
employee's
own
testimony...
were
they
adduced
as
part
of
the
plaintiff's
case
before
the
plaintiff
rested?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
prima
facie
case
is
not
dissipated
because
there
is
evidence
that
if
believed
might
require
a
ruling
in
favor
of
the
employer,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
rule
is,
i
take
it,
that
if...
once
a
prima
facie
case
is
made,
then
the
court
must
rely
on
the
employer's
explanation
if
there
is
to
be
a
ruling
for
the
employer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
this
sort
of
rule
exist
in
any
other
area
of
the
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
this
is
really
shifting
the
ultimate
burden
of
proof
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
despite
the
fact
that
green
says
that
that's
not
what
happens,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
what's
happening
here.
if
there's
evidence
in
the
record
from
which
a
trier
of
fact
in
an
ordinary
case
could
find
for
the
employer,
the
courts
prevent
it
from
doing
so.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
your
view,
under
the
chief
justice's
submission,
he
could
not...
the
trier
of
fact
could
not
take
into
account
adverse
inferences
from
the
employee's
own
testimony
so
long
as
the
employee
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
very
strange.
