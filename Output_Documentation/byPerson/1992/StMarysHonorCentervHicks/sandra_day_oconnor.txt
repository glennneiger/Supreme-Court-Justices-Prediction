justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
gardner,
even
though...
when
you
proceed
here...
when
a
plaintiff
proceeds
and
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case,
the
plaintiff
does
that
by
showing
the
plaintiff
was
fired,
that
he
was
qualified
as
an
employee,
and
that
someone
of
another
race
was
hired
instead.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that's
what
we
have
here.
that's
a
typical
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
at
the
so-called
end
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
even
if
this
other
evidence
may
emerge
that,
well,
there
was
some
animosity
here,
even
though
it
isn't
a
mandatory
presumption
at
that
stage,
there
still
are
inferences
to
be
drawn,
are
there
not,
from
the
plaintiff's
evidence
that
he
was
fired,
that
he
was
qualified,
that
someone
of
another
race
was
hired
instead?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
i
mean,
how
would
he
ever
be
entitled
to
summary
judgment
even
though
some
other
evidence
had
emerged?
i
mean,
it
still
is
a
fact
question
to
be
determined
by
the
trier
of
fact.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there's
some
evidentiary
value
to
that
evidence
whether
or
not
it's
applied
in
a
mandatory
sense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
weren't
entitled
to
summary
judgment
or
to
a
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
conclusion
of
the
plaintiff's
evidence
because
these
other
things
were
in
the
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
gardner,
now
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
really
review
the
district
court
finding
of
personal
animosity
as
a
reason.
it
instead
went
off
on
the
application
of
making
it
a
mandatory
presumption.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
we
don't
know
if
there's
enough
evidence
in
this
record
presumably
to
support
that
district
court
finding
of
personal
animosity
or
not
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
the
court
of
appeals
hasn't
evaluated
that,
and
i
guess
there's
no
reason
why
we
have
to.
we
can
deal
with
the
question
of
whether
there
should
be
a
mandatory
presumption.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
gardner,
i
tried
to
question
you
here.
now,
the
evidence
the
plaintiff
put
in
included
he
was
qualified,
he
worked
for
the
employer,
he
was
fired,
and
someone
of
a
different
race
was
hired
in
his
place.
and
that
is
ordinarily
enough
for
a
prima
facie
case.
now,
you
say
that
there
was
also
evidence
at
the
time
the
plaintiff
himself
testified
that
maybe
there
was
some
kind
of
animosity
going
on
here.
that
doesn't
wipe
out
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
what
would
amount
to
a
prima
facie
case.
i
don't
understand
why
it
wouldn't
still
go
to
the
factfinder
at
the
end
of
the
day
to
decide
whether
the
factfinder
thought
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
what
would
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
here
weren't
sufficient.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
factfinder
didn't
have
to
go
off
on
a
personal
animosity.
maybe
he
could.
that's
the
issue
here,
but
he
didn't
have
to.
it
wasn't
enough
to
entitle
you
to
any
kind
of
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
conclusion
of
the
plaintiff's
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
whenever
it
comes
in,
the
trier
of
fact
doesn't
have
to
believe
that.
to
make
your
case,
you
just
want
us
to
say
the
trier
could
believe
it.
he
didn't
have
to.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
aikens?
do
you
think
that
had
anything
to
do
with
a
case
like
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
said
that
after
the
evidence
is
in,
the
presumption
drops
out
of
the
case
and
you
go
on.
i
assumed
that
meant
something.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
presumption
drops
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
we
disagree
with
you,
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand
would
address
that
and
you
might
still
prevail.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
still
would
have
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
that
evidence.
that
doesn't
ever
leave
the
case,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
of
course,
can
you
rely
on
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
that
evidence.
