let
me--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment,
mr.
gardner?
you've
emphasized
the
usual
prima
facie
case
and
distinguishing
it
apparently
from
this
case
because
i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that
in
the
prima...
the
plaintiff's
own
evidence,
there
was
another
nonracial
reason
for
the
discharge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
does
that
not
mean
that
your
client
was
entitled
to
a...
have
the
case
dismissed
at
the
end
of
the
plaintiff's
case?
he
should
have
never
been
able
to
make
a
prima
facie
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
but
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
i'm
suggesting
that
you
didn't
even
reach
the
need
to
determine
whether
there
was
pretext
if
you're
correct.
if
the
plaintiff's
own
evidence
provided
the
basis
for
finding
an
alternative
ground
for
discharge,
you
should
have
prevailed
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
ends
when
the
plaintiff's
evidence
is
in.
that's
easy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
make
a
motion
to
dismiss
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
was
denied,
but
then
eventually
you
won
because
it
should
not
have
been
denied
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
you
call
it
a
failure
of
proof
if
what
you're
really
saying
is
that
there
was
a
third
reason,
not
the
racial
reason,
not
the
defendant's
reason,
but
this
antagonism?
is
that
a
failure
of
proof,
or
is
that
a
finding
of
an
affirmative
explanation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
there
be
a
failure
of
proof
if
you
have
a
prima
facie
case
of
racial
motivation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
no,
it
wasn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--rebutted
by
the
nondiscriminatory
reason.
it's
rebutted
by
something
that
the
defendant
did
not
rely
on.
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
is
it
if
there's
a
third
explanation
that
was
so
obvious
to
the
judge
that
the
defendant
never
mentioned
it?
it's
kind
of
counter-intuitive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
defendant's
real
reason
for
firing
him
was
there
was
animus
there,
but
the
defendant
didn't
tell
the
judge
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
thing
that
concerns
me,
mr.
gardner,
is
what
does
the
plaintiff
do
on
rebuttal.
he
looks
at
the
two
defenses
or
three
defenses.
well,
i've
blown
those
out
of
the
water.
i
better
search
the
record
for
any
possible
other
reason
that
might
occur
to
the
judge,
and
i
better
cover
the
waterfront
with
all
sorts
of
testimony.
won't
you
get
a
lot
of
collateral
issues
developed
in
the
rebuttal
stage
of
the
case
if
you
have
to
cover
every
conceivable
reason
for
discharge
even
if
not
relied
on
by
the
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
suggested
remotely
by
the
evidence.
he
was
late
one
day
a
couple
years
ago.
he
didn't
say
good
morning
to
somebody.
i
mean,
all
sorts
of
things
could
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
in
this
case,
did
the
defense
counsel
argue
to
the
judge
that
the
real
reason
was
personal
animosity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
try
the
case
for
the
plaintiff?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
try
to
put
in
any
evidence
that
there
was
no
personal
animosity?
did
you
try
to
rebut
this
potential
real
reason
for
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
it
would
have
been
permissible
as
a
matter
of
procedure
for
the
defendant's
counsel
at
the
end
of
the
cross-examination
to
say
now
our
witnesses
have
said
reasons
are
a
and
b,
but
the
cross-examination
has
brought
out
the
fact
that
it's
a...
animus
was
the
real
reason
and
we're
going
to
rely
on
that
in
closing
argument?
would
that
have
been
permissible?
