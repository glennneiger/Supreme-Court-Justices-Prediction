justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
he
has
got
nothing
to
lose
on
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
gardner,
you
have
said
that
you're
not
asking
the
court
in
this
case
to
adopt
the
view
that
the
prima
facie
case
should
be
regarded
merely
as
a
case
sufficient
to
get
to
the
factfinder.
that
might
be
nice,
but
that's
not
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
alternative
then
necessarily
that
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
to
hold
that
the
reasons
given
by
the
employer,
once
the
burden
of
going
forward
shifts,
need
not
be
ultimately
the
exclusive
reasons
that
he
relies
upon
to
defend
the
case?
in
other
words,
you're...
it
seems
to
me
you're
necessarily
saying
that
there
should
not
be
a
requirement
for
the
employer
to
raise
all
possible
defenses
that
he
intends
to
rely
on
at
that
time.
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
usually
as
close
as
i
get.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
think
you
are
saying
that
the
employer
is
not
confined
to
the
reasons
he
gives
even
though
all
of
those
reasons
may,
in
fact,
turn
out
to
be
pretextual,
the
reasons
he
raises
in
his
defense
when
the
burden
shifts
to
him.
you're
saying
he
is
not
confined
to
those.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
do
you
split
them
up?
i
mean,
you're
not
simply
saying
that
the
employer
ought
to
have
the
possibility
of
a
wild
card
in
the
form
of
a
factfinder
who
says,
well,
i
think
in
this
instance
i'll
go
beyond
the
reasons
given.
you're
saying
that's
a
legitimate
thing
to
do,
and
if
it's
a
legitimate
thing
to
do,
then
i
can't
think
of
any
reason
why
the
employer
shouldn't
be
able
to
argue
it.
he
says,
look,
i
gave
you
two
reasons,
purely
pretextual,
but
i've
got
some
more
evidence,
and
if
you're
going
to
find
against
me
on
these
two
stated
reasons
as
pretextual,
let
me
throw
in
the
rest
of
the
evidence
and
you
may
find
that
i've
got
a
third
good
reason
that
i
haven't
mentioned
yet.
you're
saying
that
that's
legitimate.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
if
that's
the
case,
then
why
don't
we
go
right
back
to
the
point
that
i
guess
justice
scalia
made
and
say
the
real
error
in
this
case
is
that
there
was
never
a
prima
facie
case
made?
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
not
monkey
with
the
standards
for
raising
defenses
if,
in
fact,
the
very
first
stage,
even
that
is
the
predicate
for
shifting
to
the...
or
raising
the
burden
of
going
forward
is
not
satisfied.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
we
look
at
it
that
way,
what
have
we
got
here
in
this
case?
just
a
matter
of
error
correction
i
guess.
the
district
court's
error
was
in
failing
to
see
the
plaintiff's
failure
in
the
first
instance.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what's
your...
what's--
--of
course.
the
plaintiff
thought
it
was
racial.
i'm
sorry.
i
was
going
to
say
and
what's
the
justification.
coming
back
to
kind
of
the
other
alternative
analysis,
what's
the
justification
for
allowing
the
defendant
to
profit
by
this
if
he
never
raises
it
as
a
defense?
it's
sitting
right
there
in
front
of
him.
he
never
mentions
it.
why...
as
a
matter
of
just
sensible
procedure,
why
allow
him
to
take
advantage
of
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
very
well
be.
i'm
just
raising
simply
a
procedural
point.
let's
get
our
issues
defined,
and
the
way
to
define
our
issues
is
to
require
the
defendant,
when
it's...
when
the
burden
shifts
to
the
defendant,
to
give
all
the
reasons
that
he
may
rely
on.
and
if
he
chooses
to
omit
one,
particularly
one
which
you
claim
here
was
disclosed
by
the
plaintiff's
case,
why
in
effect
should
he
be
allowed
to
do
that?
why
not
simply
adopt
a
rule
that
says
we
want
to
know
what
the
defenses
are
going
to
be,
defining
the
issues
before
us
at
least
at
the
point
at
which
the
burden
shifts
to
the
defendant.
if
he
does
not
give
that
reason,
too
bad.
he
can't
rely
on
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
look,
the
factfinder
is
not
an
independent
party
here.
if
a
defendant...
a
factfinder
is
straitjacketed
when
somebody
doesn't
raise
a
defense,
let's
not
cry
for
the
factfinder.
why
as
a
matter
of
just
sensible
procedure
do
we
not
require
that
the
defenses
be
raised
and
that
the
person
who
raises
them
be
limited
to
them?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
you
lose.
well,
maybe
it's
because--
