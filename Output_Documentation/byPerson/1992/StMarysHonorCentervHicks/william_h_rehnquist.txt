argument

st.

v.
melvin
hicks.
mr.
gardner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
the
employer,
after
the
prima
facie
case
is
made,
testifies
that
my
reason
for
firing
the
person
was
not
discriminatory.
it
was
thus
and
so.
well,
that
certainly
is
evidence
of
a
nondiscriminatory
reason,
but
the
finder
of
fact
isn't
required
to
believe
the
employer
when
it
comes
to
the
ultimate
decision,
is
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
your
opponent
agree,
do
you
think,
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
found
as
a
fact
that
the
reason
for
the
discharge
was
not
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
does
he
agree
that
the
district
court
made
that
finding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
just
take
witnesses
to
tell
kind
of
a
chronological
story
i
suppose,
and
it
isn't
necessarily
parsed
out
as
to
this
shows
the
mcdonnell
douglas
burden
and
then
we
get
to
another.
you're
going
to
take
the
witnesses
and
find
out
everything
they
have
to
say
on
the
subject.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
wanted
to
fit
this
more
tightly
into
the
mcdonnell
douglas
framework,
if
that
were
thought
necessary,
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
the
judge's
finding
that
the
discharge
resulted
from
personal
animus
was
a
finding
of
a
nonpretextual
reason
for
the
discharge.
that
was
the
factual
reason
in
the
view
of
the
judge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
your
position
is
that
before
the
plaintiff's
case
rested,
there
was
testimony
that
the
firing
was
due
to
personal
animosity
for
reasons
other
than
racial
antagonism.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
aikens,
we
said
that
after
all
the
evidence
is
in,
the
presumptions
are
much
less
important.
it's
just
a
question
of
was
there...
did
the
employer
discriminate
or
did
the
employer
not
discriminate,
and
just
look
at
all
the
evidence
and
make
a
factual
determination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
gardner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
oldham.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
something
to
what
mr.
gardner
was
saying
about
the
way
a
trial
proceeds,
that
you
don't
say
now
we're
going
to
call
three
witnesses
to
make
out
our
prima
facie
case?
you
put
on
a
witness.
you
find
out
as
much
as
you
can
from
him
on
both
sides.
then
you
go
on
to
the
next
witness,
and
sometimes
you
can't
be
sure
at
what
point
the
prima
racie
case
has
been
made
out.
you
know
at
the
end
of
all
the
witnesses
the
plaintiff
has
called
it
has.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
can
call
the
employer
as
a
witness
if
you
want
to,
can't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
plaintiff,
in
the
course
of
his
testimony,
had
offered
evidence
of
a
fact
which
would
have
justified
a
conclusion
that
there
was
a
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
his
firing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
doesn't...
i'm
not
saying
he
makes
an
admission
as
if
these
were
pleadings.
we're
talking
about
testimony,
not
defenses
and
complaints
and
so
on.
supposing
the
plaintiff
gets
up
and
testifies
that
i
was
fired
because
i
was
black
and
i
know
the
employer
didn't
like
blacks
and
he
wanted
to
get
rid
of
me.
but
also
in
the
course
of
his
testimony,
he
gives
evidence
of
facts
which
would
justify
a
finder
of
fact
in
saying,
well,
look,
i
see
that
the
reason
was
not
because
he
was
black,
but
because
thus
and
so.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
joined
the
burdine
opinion.
i
never
thought
of
it
as
just
imposing
a
totally
different
regime
on
this
particular
type
of
trial
as
are
opposed...
imposed
on
all
other
regimes
of
trying
cases.
i
mean,
you
can
have
evidence
that
comes
out
in
the
plaintiff's
case
from
the
plaintiff's
own
mouth
that
will
be
favorable
to
the
defendant,
and
that's
ordinarily
something
the
trier
of
fact
can
take
into
consideration.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
this
be
different
than
a
negligence
case?
you
know,
the
plaintiff
gets
up
and
testified,
you
know,
i
slipped
and
fell,
and
there
was...
it
was
icy
and
there
was...
the
employer
failed
to
shovel
the
walks.
well,
again,
the
plaintiff
in
that
sort
of
a
case
can
testify
in
a
way
that
would
entitle
a
jury
to
find
there
was
no
negligence,
and
we
don't
say
that
because
it
came
out
of
the
plaintiff's
mouth,
it's
somehow...
the
defendant
didn't
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
rebut
it
or
the
plaintiff
didn't
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
rebut
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
do
you
think
congress
intended
that
the
factfinding
process
in
these
cases
should
be
different
than
the
factfinding
process
in
all
other
sort
of
civil
litigation
was?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
unique
in
the...
perhaps,
although
i'm
not
so
sure
it's
that
different
than
res
ipso
loquitur
or
something
like
that
in
negligence
cases,
that
if
the
plaintiff
shows
certain
elements,
he's
entitled
to
have
the
finder
of
fact
make
a
determination
in
his
favor.
but
i
think
you're
adding
onto
it
a
lot
when
you
say
that
testimony
that
comes
in
during
the
trial
can't
be
used
for
purposes
that
it
would
be
used
for
in
every
other
sort
of
a
civil
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
federal
rules
have
a
provision
that
if
an
issue
not
in
the
pleadings
is
tried
by
consent
of
the
parties,
they're...
the
pleadings
are
deemed
amended,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dumont,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dumont.
the
case
is
submitted.
