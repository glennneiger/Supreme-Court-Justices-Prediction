so,
then
an
employer
is
really
well
advised
to
come
up
with
a
pretextual
reason
as
your
opponents
says
in
his
brief.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
stand
silent,
you
lose.
right?
automatically
because
of
the
prima
facie
case,
you
must
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
better
to
come
up
with...
once
you
come
up
with
some
pretext,
you
don't
necessarily
lose.
then
the
factfinder
can
decide,
well,
even
though
this
was
a
pretext,
and
even
though
there
was
a
prima
facie
case,
nonetheless,
i
just
don't
basically
believe
that
there
was
racial
discrimination
going
on
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
at
least
you'd
have
a
finding.
at
least
you'd
have
a
factfinder
who
could
make
a
finding;
whereas,
if
he
doesn't
come
up
with
a
pretext,
the
game
is
over.
there's
no
finding
possible
you
tell
us.
right?
the
prima
facie
case
governs.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gardner,
what
is
the
effect
of
the
prima
facie
case?
i
mean,
maybe
we
could
avoid
the
dilemma
that
the
other
side
says
exists
if
the
effect
of
the
prima
facie
case
is
not
to
entitle
the
employee
to
judgment
if
there's
no
response
from
the
employer,
no
other
reason
given,
but
rather
just
to
entitle
the
employee
to
get
to
the
factfinder.
in
other
words,
it
survives
your
motion
to
dismiss,
but
the
fact...
which
means
the
factfinder
may
find
in
favor
of
the
employee,
but
perhaps
the
prima
facie
case
does
not
mean
that
the
factfinder
must
find
in
favor
of
the
employee.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand
that,
but
we
wouldn't
be
faced
with
this
dilemma,
would
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
don't
really
know
that.
we
know
personal
animosity,
but
he
could
have
not
liked
this
man
because
he
was
black.
all
we
know
is
that
there
was
personal
animosity.
we
don't
know
what
the
basis
for
the
personal
animosity--
--after
the
plaintiff
rested,
the
defendant
came
forward
with
some
evidence,
and
that
is
the
evidence
which
undermines
the
inference
that
the
personal
animosity
was
racially
motivated.
that
evidence
is...
there
was
a
full
scale
changeover
in
the
supervisory
personnel
in
the
institution.
there
were
six
supervisors,
but
the
institution
was
so
poorly
run
that
four
of
the
six
supervisors
were
gone.
mr.
hicks
was
not
one
of
the
four.
but
even
though
there
is
this
changeover
in
the
institution
as
a
whole,
the
number
of
blacks
employed
at
the
beginning
of
a
calendar
year
was
the
same
as
at
the
end
of
the
calendar
year.
the
number
of
blacks
hired
and
fired
was
the
same
at
the
beginning...
the
number
of
blacks
hired
and
fired
was
approximately
equal.
the
number
of
people,
those
six
people,
in
a
supervisory
position
would
have
been
equally
split
between
black
and
white
after
the
changeover
if
one
of
the
person...
black
person
had
accepted
an
offer
for
it.
the
person
who
showed
the
personal
animosity
was
not
the
one
in
charge
of
all
of
these--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
all
of
these
decisions.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
against
hicks.
so,
the
fact
that
higher
up
people
kept
the
same
racial
balance
that
used
to
be
there
does
not
show
whether
this
particular
supervisor
disliked
mr.
hicks
because
he
was
black
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
employer
is
not
likely
to
come
up
with
some
of
these
answers
because
they
are
not
rational
answers.
i
mean,
you
come
up
with
the
answer,
well,
this
employee
was
not
working
well,
and
that's
why
i
dismissed
him.
that's
what
the
employer
will
come
up
with.
he
won't
come
up
with
the
explanation
which
you
assert
was
the
real
case
here.
well,
for
some
reason
or
other,
my
supervisor
just
didn't
like
this
guy.
i
mean,
it's
maybe
unrealistic
to
expect
the
employer
to
come
in
with
such
an
irrational
explanation.
