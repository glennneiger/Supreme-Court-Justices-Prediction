mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
burdine
and
aikens
explicitly
state,
that
at
the
final
stage
of
the
mcdonnell
douglas
analysis,
the
plaintiff
can
carry
his
ultimate
burden
of
proving
discrimination
in
one
of
two
ways,
either
directly
or...
and
i
quote
from
both
opinions...
indirectly
by
showing
that
the
employer's
proffered
explanation
is
unworthy
of
credence.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
with
respect,
your
honor,
we
would
disagree
that
that
is
what
burdine
said,
and
we
think
that
is
not
what
burdine
ought
to
say
because
burdine
and
aikens,
the
whole
like
of
cases,
set
up
a
sensible
and
orderly
system
for
getting
at
the
ultimate
issue
in
these
cases,
which
is
discrimination.
now,
it's
clear
that
in
some
cases,
the
plaintiff
will
have
direct
evidence
and
therefore
can
use
the
first
option
of
persuading
the
trier
of
fact
directly
that
there
was
discrimination.
but
burdine
sets
up
the
second
and
indirect
method
of
proving
discrimination,
the
proof
of...
that
the
employer's
reasons
are
unworthy
of
credence
precisely
because
in
many
discrimination
cases
there
will
not
be
direct
evidence.
and
we
would
suggest
that
on
the--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--we
believe
that
when
the
defendant
has
articulated
particular
reasons
for
his
actions
and
the
plaintiff
has
disproved
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
trier
of
fact
those
reasons--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that
it's
mandatory
for
the
court
or
the
factfinder
to
return--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--we
think
burdine
holds
that,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
and
aikens.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
aikens
says
that
once
there
was
a
full
trial,
as
there
was
in
this
case,
that
we
go
straight
to
the
issue
of
discrimination.
the
question
is
how
is
the
plaintiff
able
to
prove
discrimination,
and
we
would
say
that
both
burdine
and
aikens,
which
reiterated
the
language
from
burdine,
say
that
he
can
prove
it
in
two
ways,
either
directly--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--right.
that
is
what
we
are
saying,
your
honor,
and
let
me
say
why.
we
think
that
once
the
defendant
has
come
forward
with
specific
reasons...
after
all,
this
information
is
uniquely
within
the
ken
of
the
defendant.
once
the
defendant
has
come
forward
and
articulated
particular
reasons,
reasonably,
specifically,
and
clearly,
as
burdine
says
he
must
do,
that
the
plaintiff's
burden
is
set
as
a
sort
of
matter
of
orderly
judicial
procedure.
that
is
what
the
plaintiff
then
has
to
contend
with,
and
both
for
the
benefit
of
the
plaintiff,
giving
him
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
meet
the
defendant's
case,
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
court
in
assuring
that
the
adversarial
factfinding
process
proceeds
in
the
way
that
will
generate
a
true
result.
you
can't
get
a
true
result
under
the
circumstances,
for
instance,
of
this
case
where
the
entire
case
was
tried
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
defendant's
disciplinary
reasons
were
or
were
not
valid,
and
the
court
on
its
own
came
up
with
a
reason
which
has
no
support
at
all
in
the
record.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
we
think
that
the
functional
test
here
is
the
test
that
burdine
sets
out
which
is
a
reasonably
clear
and
specific
articulation
by
the
defendant
of
particular
reasons
why
it
took
its
action
to
meet
the
prima
facie
case
and
then
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
for
the
plaintiff
to
contest
those
reasons.
now,
they
can
emerge
at
any
time
during
the
trial.
they
do
have
to
be
reasonably
specifically
articulated,
but
it
might
happen
during
the
trial.
it
might
happen
on...
out
of
something
that
came
out
of
the
plaintiff's
evidence,
but
we
do
think
that
the
defendant
would
be
required
to
step
up
to
the
plate
and
accept
whatever
reasons
he's
planning
to
rely
on.
that
defines
what
the
plaintiff
will
try
to
rebut,
and
that
defines
what
the
decision
maker
will
have
an
opportunity
to
decide
on.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
if
in
fact
the
defendant
offers
no
specific
articulation
of
why
it
took
the
action
that
it
took,
aside
from
a
general
denial
of
discrimination,
then
we
would
submit
that
under
burdine,
the
defendant
would
have
to
lose.
it
has
not
carried
its
burden
of
rebutting
the
prima
facie
case.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
yes.
we
believe
that
the
point
is
to
frame
the
issue
really
for
the
trial
court
or
the
factfinder.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
it's
also
the
point
of
trial,
as
you
pointed
out
before,
the
pleadings
are
amended
effectively
to
conform
to
the
proof
at
trial
by
the
end
of
the
trial.
when
you
get
to
the
end
of
the
trial,
as
aikens
says,
you
should
take
all
the
evidence
taken
together
and
make
a
decision
on
the
question
of
discrimination.
now,
the
question
is
what
does
the
plaintiff
have
to
prove,
and
we
submit
that
it's
unreasonable
to
make
the
plaintiff
try
to
disprove,
which
is
exactly
what
the
petitioners
contend...
try
to
disprove
every
possible
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
the
action--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
that
the
burden
of
the
court's
opinion
in
burdine
is
that
as
a
way
of
getting
these
very
complex
cases
where,
after
all,
any
reason
or
completely
arbitrary
reason
would
be
legitimate
so
long
as
it
is
not
one
of
the
prohibited
reasons...
in
order
to
distill
the
potential
mass
of
evidence
down
to
a
manageable
framework
for
the
court,
it's
perfectly
reasonable
to
ask
the
defendant
to
come
forward
and
say,
well,
what
did
happen
here.
you
know.
what
did
happen
here?
allege
your
reasons
and
then
allow
the
plaintiff
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
meet
those
reasons.
what
strikes
us
as
fundamentally
unfair
to
the
plaintiff
and
unwise
from
the
point
of
view
of
accurate
factfinding,
is
to
say
that
once
the
plaintiff
has
met
the
plaintiff's...
the
defendant's
articulated
reasons,
the
factfinder
may
then
range
through
the
record
and
pick
out
some
reason...
either
pick
out
a
reason
which
may
be
what
happened
here
and
say
i
think
this
is
more
likely
when
the
plaintiff
has
not--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that
is
what
you
have
to
decide,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
i
think
what
we
need
to
look
at
is
what
is
in
the
case
at
the
end
of
the
case.
the
plaintiff
has
proved
a
prima
facie
case.
the
defendant
has
articulated
certain
reasons.
the
plaintiff
has,
by
hypothesis,
disproved
those
reasons
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
trier
of
fact.
all
that
is
left
in
the
case
is
the
evidence
supporting
the
prima
facie
case,
the
evidence
that
the
defendant
has
lied
or
is
unwilling
or
unable
to
come
forward
with
a
credible
reason
for
its
actions,
and
essentially
nothing
else.
now,
on
those
facts--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--there
could
only
be
one
of
two
other
things,
either
evidence
that
came
in
in
the
plaintiff's
case,
which
i
submit
is
not
true
here...
and
the
court
of
appeals
was
quite
clear
about
that.
they
said
it
was
merely
an
assumption,
this
personal
animosity
thing...
or
evidence
that
the
defendant
has
somehow
introduced
or
that
seems
to
arise
out
of
the
evidence
that
the
defendant
has
been
specifically
unwilling
to
embrace,
as
is
the
case
here.
and
we
would
submit
that's
not
a
sensible
rule
of
judicial
procedure
to
allow
a
factfinder
to
go
off
on
that
ground
when
the
defendant
has
refused
to
embrace
it.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
don't
believe
that
it's
inconsistent
in
this
case,
your
honor.
thank
you,
your
honor.
