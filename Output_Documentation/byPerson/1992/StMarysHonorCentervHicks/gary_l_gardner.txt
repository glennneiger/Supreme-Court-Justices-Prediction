mr.
gary
l.
gardner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
employment
discrimination
case
alleging
racial
discrimination
in
demotion
and
discharge
is
whether
a
district
court
is
compelled
as
a
matter
of
law,
because
of
a
finding
of
pretext,
to
enter
a
judgment
for
the
employee
even
though
he
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
there
was
no
intentional
discrimination
and
believed
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
was
no
intentional
discrimination.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no
because,
as
this
court
said
in
aikens,
once
legitimate,
nondiscriminatory
reasons
have
been
articulated
for
the
employment
decision,
no
presumption
operates
and
the
trier
of
fact
must
make
a
factual
determination
about
whether
there
was
intentional
discrimination
or
not.
aikens
rejected
a
rigid,
mechanistic,
and
ritualistic
method
of
factfinding,
a
method
that
i
think
would
straitjacket
factfinders
and
actually
obstruct
the
truth-seeking
process.
if
rejected
a
method
like
the
method
appearing
on
page
18
of
the
employee's
brief
on
the
merits,
a
method...
a
diagram
type
method
which
typifies
a
rigid
approach
to
factfinding,
which
should
not
be
taken
in
employment
discrimination
cases.
this--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--in
the
usual
case
he
is,
your
honor,
because
in
the
usual
case,
there's
no
evidence
at
all
of
any
nondiscriminatory
reason
for
the
discharge.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
well,
if
the
employer--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--if
the
plaintiff
fails
to
prove
pretext--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--yes,
of
course,
the
case
is
over.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
the
case
is
not
over.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
i
can
imagine
some
situations
where
the
employer
is
silent
in
response
to
the
prima
facie
case,
but
the
case
is
not
over
because
there
are
some
situations
where
the
evidence
of
the
prima
facie
case
may
also
contain
in
it
evidence
of
a
nondiscriminatory
reason,
as
the
evidence
in
this
case
in
the
evidence
of
pretext
contained
in
it
a
nondiscriminatory
reason.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
no,
he's
not,
and
he's
not
required
to
believe
the
employee.
on
the
other
hand,
even
if
there
is
a
finding
of
pretext
that
the
offered
reason
was
not
the
actual
reason,
the
finder
of
fact
has
got
to
decide
which
one
it
really
believes
is
the
actual
motive
of
the
employer.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i
believe
my
opponent
does
not
agree
with
that
finding
of
the
district
court.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
yes,
he
does.
that
was
a
finding
of
fact
that
the
district
court
made
after
he
weighed
all
the
evidence,
after
he
made
credibility
determinations,
and
he
found
that
there
was
no
intentional
discrimination
because
there
was
evidence
before
him
which
undermined
any
inference
of
intentional
discrimination
and
which
revealed
a
motive
for
the
employment
decision
other
than
the
employee's
motive
or
the
employer's
proffered
motive.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
yes,
he
did.
he
found
that
the...
his
words
were
that
the
proffered
reason
was
not
the
actual
reason.
he
did
not
accept,
however,
the
employee's
explanation
that
the
actual
reason
was
a
racially
motivated
reason.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
not
so,
your
honor.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
in
the
usual
prima
facie
case.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
but
an
employer's--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--an
employer
should
never
come
up
with
a
pretextual
reason.
it's
never
in
his
interest
to
do
so
because--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--yes,
he
does.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
an
inference
of
improper
motive
discrimination
can
be
drawn
from
the
finding
of
pretext.
that's
the
common
sense
rule...
part
of
the
rule
of
mcdonnell
douglas.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
well,
that's
in
the
situation
of
the
usual
prima
facie
case
which
eliminates
all
or
most
common
reasons
for
an
action.
this
is
not
really
the
usual
case.
the
plaintiff's
evidence
in
this
case
from
the
very
first
witness,
whether
it
was
in
the
pretext
stage
or
in
the
prima
facie
stage
of
the
case,
presented
evidence
of
a
motive
other
than
discrimination
and
other
than
the
employer's
proffered
reason--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--a
third
explanation
for
the
employment
decision.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i'm
saying
that,
yes.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
no,
your
honor,
because
there
was
a
finding
of
pretext.
it's
difficult--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--i
agree
with
you
if
we
were
able
to...
if
we
are
able
to
distinguish
in
these
trials
when
the
prima
facie
case
stage
ends,
when
the
rebuttal
of
that
begins,
and
when
that
ends.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
well,
when
the
plaintiff's
evidence
is
in,
it
usually
contains
the
evidence
of
pretext
also.
we
did
not
try
this
case
in
sections,
prima
facie
case,
rebuttal,
pretext
stage,
and
rebuttal
to
that.
it
came
in
all
at
once.
plaintiff's
evidence
had
everything
in
it.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i
did.
the
district
court--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--if
we
can
distinguish
in
the
steps
of
the
case.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
right.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
that's
the
usual
prima
facie
case.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
that's
correct.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i
agree
with
you.
once
there
is
the
prima
facie
case,
once
there
is
evidence
of
pretext,
the
employee
may
still
prevail
if
the
district
court
believed
and
credited
that
evidence.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--i
think
so
because
we
tried
it
all
at
once.
we
tried
the
prima
facie
case
and
we
tried
the
pretext
part
of
the
case
all
at
once.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
exactly,
your
honor.
the
first
witness
didn't
testify
to
the
prima
facie
case
and
sit
down,
and
then
the
employer
come
and
testify,
and
then
the
employee
came
again
and
testify.
the
first
witness,
mr.
hicks,
testified
about
everything
right
to
the--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--that's
interesting,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
has
been
the
position
of
the
court,
however.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
that's
true.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
change
that.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
well,
i'm
not
here
today
asking
you
to
promulgate
that
rule
because
it's
not
necessary
to
resolve
this
particular
case.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
that
sounds
very
reasonable.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
to
come
forward
with
an
articulation
of
a
legitimate,
nondiscriminatory
reason,
but--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--again,
i
would
say
the
same
thing
as
i
said
to
justice
scalia.
that
has
not
been
the
position
of
this
court.
it
has
always
been
that
the
burden
of
proof
does
not
shift
in
the
indirect
evidence
situation,
but
stays
always
with
the
employee.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
well,
that
is
an
unremarkable
principle.
it's
not
a
matter
of
the
employer
switching
grounds
in
this
case.
the
legitimate,
nondiscriminatory
reasons
we
proffered
we
believe
in
and
we
still
believe
in
today.
the
factfinder
didn't
find
those
to
be
the
actual
reasons
and,
for
that
reason,
decided
that
there
was
no
showing
of
actual
discrimination,
which
is
the
plaintiff's
burden.
and
i
think
it's
proper
for
the
employer
to
rely
upon
a
failure
of
proof
by
the
plaintiff,
which
is
what
the
district
court
held.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
well,
it's
a
failure
of
proof
of
racial
motivation.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
well,
because
that
has
been
rebutted
by
the
nondiscriminatory
reason.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
it
does
not--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--well,
the
pretext...
the
finding
of
pretext
was
rebutted
by
the
personal
animosity,
but
once
the
legitimate,
nondiscriminatory
reason
has
been
proffered,
there's
no
more
presumption
which
operates.
it
becomes
solely
then
weighing
evidence
and
credibility
determinations
and
then
going
to
the
fact
of
whether
there
has
been
proof
of
intentional
discrimination.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
it
would
be
a
nonpretextual
reason
in
the
sense
that
if
one
equates
pretext
with
intentional
discrimination,
it
would
be
a
nonpretextual
reason.
the
district
court
did
not
look
at
it
that
way.
the
district
court
equated
pretext
with
just
not
the
actual
reason
and
looked
at
all
of
the
explanations
which
it
had
before
it
from
the
two
parties
and
from
the
third
reason
to
determine
what
the
actual
reason
was.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
that's
right.
it
did
not
review
subsidiary
findings
of
fact.
it
really
did
not
review
the
ultimate
finding
of
fact.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i
think
you
do
know
that
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
testimony
from
mr.
hicks
himself
and
his
witness
about
the
personal
animosity.
in
a
nutshell,
it
was
that
his
supervisor
admitted
to
him
that
he
was
trying
to
make
him
fight.
the
other
evidence
which
shows
that
that
personal
animosity
is
credible
is
the
explanation,
rather
than
the
racial
inference...
is
the
evidence
which
undermined
the
racial
inference.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
that's
true.
you
could
just
say
it
need
not
be
a
mandatory
presumption,
but
the
evidence--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
was
adduced
through
the
plaintiff
himself.
he
was
the
first
witness.
it
was
the
plaintiff's,
mr.
hicks',
testimony
and
the
testimony
of
a
coemployee.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
that's
true.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
no,
but--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--no.
the
person
who
showed
the
personal
animosity
is
the
one
who
initiated
every
employment
action
that
was
taken
against
mr.
hicks.
there
was
four
of
them
in
a
month
and
a
half.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
also,
this
particular
supervisor
did
not
initiate
any
discipline
against
mr.
hicks'
subordinates
who
actually
committed
the
violation
who
were
also
black.
he
apparently
picked
mr.
hicks
out
and
excluded
other
black
employees
who
actually
committed
the
violations,
and
mr.
hicks
was
disciplined
essentially
for
permitting
them
to
commit
them.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
that's
right.
i'm
not
asking
you
to
do
that.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
approximately
fair.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
it's
always
in
the
employer's
interest
to
not
present
a
pretextual
reason.
it's
always
in
the
employer's
interest
to
present
all
the
reasons
because
an
adverse
inference
can
be
drawn
if
he
does
not.
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
when
all
is
said
and
done,
the
finder
of
fact
has
to
determine
from
the
evidence
before
it
what
was
the
motive,
and
if
there's
evidence
of
a
third
explanation
for
the
motive
there,
which
he
thinks
is
credible
and
has
evidence
in
the
record
that
links
it
to
credibility
and
undermines
the
racial
inference,
the
finder
of
fact
ought
to
be
permitted
to
base
his
decision
on
that
as
long
as
there's
sufficient
evidence.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i
would
say
the
trier
of
fact
is
not
confined
to
those
reasons
so
long
as
there's--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--it's
legitimate...
he
doesn't
sandbag
the
court
and
say
if
you're
going
to
find
this,
this
is
the
real
reason.
it's
legitimate
if
that
third
reason
comes
out
in
the
plaintiff's
case,
as
it
did
in
this
case.
the
plaintiff
knows
it's
there.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
it
can
be
looked
at
that
way.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
it
can
be
looked
at
that
way,
your
honor,
because
the
evidence
of
the
third
motive
came
out
in
the
very
first
witness.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
if
it's
looked
at
in
that
way,
that
would
be
the
district
court's
error.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--i
think
the
difficulty
is
trying
to
pin
down
exactly
at
what
stage
the
third
explanation
came
in.
if
we
pin
it
down
that
it
came
in
at
the
prima
facie
case
stage,
justice
souter's
explanation--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--that's
true.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
no,
it's
not.
it's
still
there
to
draw
the
inference.
the
district
court
dissipated
the
presumption,
so
to
speak,
and
went
to
the
factual
question.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i
think
that's
the
way
the
district
court
looked
at
it
rather
than
seeing
it
as
a
failure
of
the
prima
facie
case.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i
think
that's
it
in
a
nutshell.
that...
the
presumption
has
disappeared.
it
undermines
the
requirement
that
there
be
a
factual
finding
of
intentional
discrimination,
and
there's
a
third
explanation
in
this
record.
not
all
proffered
explanations
have
been--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--plaintiff
never
mentioned
it
either.
it
was
his
testimony
and
apparently
was
unaware
like
defendant
that--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--nor
the
plaintiff.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
because
the
falsity
of
the
justification
does
not
necessarily
mean
that
there
has
been
discrimination.
it
can
be
false--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--the
problem
i
see
with
that
is
it
might
straitjacket
factfinders.
there
may
be
some
evidence
in
there,
like
this
case,
where
neither
party
was
aware.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i
don't
know
really.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
not--
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
--like
i
said,
mr.
powell
initiated
all
of
the
employment
actions
and
the
supervisors'
and
mr.
powell
mistake
was
was
not
perceiving
it
at
that
time,
that
it
was
personally
motivated
then.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
i
don't
think
we
have
to
cover
every
conceivable
reason,
only
those
that
had
sufficient
evidence.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
not
suggested
remotely,
your
honor.
supported
by
sufficient
evidence.
mr.
gary
l.
gardner
thank
you.
