mr.
charles
f.
schill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
practice
of
the
federal
circuit
at
issue
here
has
resulted
in
resurrecting
patents
which
have
been
twice
found
invalid
by
district
courts.
this
practice
is
out
of
step
with
the
precedent
of
this
court
and
commercial
reality.
i
want
to
make
three
points
to
you
in
my
argument
today.
first,
the
federal
circuit
has
jurisdiction
to
decide--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--i
certainly
plan
to,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
i
certainly
shall.
may
i
proceed
with
my
three
points,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
f.
schill
okay.
the
federal
circuit
had
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
patent
and
validity
issue,
and
this
issue
is
not
moot.
the
federal
circuit's
practice
ignores
the
strong
public
interest
in
resolving
the
invalidity
issue,
and
finally,
that
the
federal
circuit
should
always
reach
the
issue
of
validity
when
presented
on
appeal
in
a
declaratory
judgment
counterclaim
unless
that
issue
becomes
moot
through
happenstance
during
the
appeal,
or
if
a
decision
on
another
issue
in
the
case
completely
resolves
the
controversy
between
the
parties,
and
with
respect
to
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
we
believe
that
there
is
a
case
of
controversy
that
has
proceeded
since
the
beginning
in
this
case,
there
is
a
difference
between
the
case
brought
by
morton
on
the
infringement
issue.
that
is,
morton
is
accusing
us
of
infringement.
that
is
decided
by
a
very
special
set
of
facts,
and
cardinal
had
separate,
independent
basis
on
which
to
assert
its
claim
that
the
patent
was
invalid.
if
the
patent
is,
indeed,
invalid,
then
not
only
does
morton's
claim
fail
against
us,
it
fails
against
all
parties,
and
not
only
against
the
particular
products
that
were
at
issue
in
this
case,
but
all
the
products
that
cardinal
may
wish
to
make
in
the
future.
since
this
issue,
or
these
parties--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
i
believe
that
the
way
i
would
put
the
issue,
or
resolve
that
issue,
is
that
the
court
has
erred
because
it
has
not
resolved
the
controversy
between
the
parties
in
this
case.
there
may
be
some
factual
situations
in
which
it
need
not
reach
the
issue
of
validity.
for
example,
one
case
might
be
where
the
issue
of
unenforceability
was
also
there,
and
the
court
decided
that
the
patent
was
unenforceable,
for
example,
either
against
the
particular
party
or
parties
or
the
world.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
i
agree
that
that
is
the
same
position,
ultimately,
that
they
take.
we
differ
only
in
how
we
would
express
it.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
how
is
there...
i'm
not
sure
there
is
a
controversy
on
the
point
of
what
the
federal
circuit
should
do
on
which...
on
which
you
granted
cert.
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
us--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--we--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--no,
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
this
court's
precedent
in
the
altvater
and
electrical
fittings
case
is
still
good
law,
and
that
would
require
that
there
be
a
difference
made
between
cases
which
are
only
filed
with
a
bill
and
answer
as
opposed
to
a
counterclaim
that,
by
the
very
nature
of
a
situation
such
as
was
present
in
electrical
fittings,
there
was
only
an
accusation,
a
claim
of
infringement
and
no
counterclaim.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
yes.
they
would
reach
the
issue
on
all
points.
they
would
say
that
the
federal
circuit
should
reach
validity
on
all
points.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
yes,
there
is
indeed,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
justice
souter.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
yes,
i
believe
that
it
does,
because
a...
there
is
no
right
to
have
a
decision
on
a
defense.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
the
court
does
still
have
jurisdiction
to
render
it
if
it
wishes
to
reach
that
issue.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
in
this
case,
the
court...
the
federal
circuit...
vacated
the
declaratory
judgment
of
invalidity
that
cardinal
won
at
the
lower
court.
the
only
reason
that
it
provided
was
its
reference
to
the
case
vieau
v.
japax,
and
in
reviewing
that
case,
the
only
rationale
provided
by
the
court
was
that,
since
there
was
no
indication
in
that
case
that
the
dispute
extended
beyond
the
accused
devices
found
not
infringing,
the
court
properly
exercises
its
discretion
to
dismiss
the
cross-appeal
as
moot.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
we
find
that
that
would...
that
is...
the
court
is
either...
is
incorrect
in
its
formulation,
i
believe,
because
either
the
issue
is
moot
and
it
has
no
discretion
to
reach
it...
that
is,
it's
jurisdictionally
moot
under
article
3...
or
it's
exercising
its
discretion
and
has
taken
into
account
certain
factors
in
order
to
decide
whether
it
should
reach
the
issue.
here,
since
the
court
adopted
this
practice
in
1987,
it
has
merely
cited
to
the
vieau
v.
japax
case
and
has
gone
no
further.
it
has
not
reviewed
the
underlying
facts
in
the
case
to
determine
whether
there
was
indeed
a
basis
for
the
continued
controversy.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
well,
if
it
made
no
difference
to
the
judgment
below,
perhaps
that
would
be
proper,
your
honor,
but
i
do
believe
it
does
make
a
difference
to
the
decision
below,
especially
in
this
case.
this
case
was
based
on
a
separate
counterclaim
by
cardinal
for
invalidity
of
the
patent.
there
was
good
cause
for
cardinal
to
bring
that
action.
there's
no
question
that
the
district
court
felt
that
there
was
proper
case
or
controversy
jurisdiction
on
that
issue.
he
rendered
a
judgment.
no
facts
change.
all
of
a
sudden
you're
trying
to
oust
the
declaratory
judgment
winner
of
its
decision
without
any
rationale.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
affirmative
defense.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
yes.
if
there's
an
affirmative
defense,
the
affirmative
defense
relies
upon
the
claim.
once
the
claim
itself
is
gone,
then
there
is
really
no
basis
for
the
defendant
to
prevail
on
its
counter...
or,
on
its
affirmative
defense.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
right.
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
the
court
has
to.
i
would
still
take
the
position
that
the
court
may
reach
that
issue.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
well--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--not
on
the
issue,
your
honor,
where
it's
raised
as
an
affirmative
defense.
i
would
say
that
we're
not
in
that
category.
i
think
my
opposition
is
in
that
category.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
do
you
mean
no
matter
how
it
was
raised,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
f.
schill
yes.
well,
that's
something
i
think
that's
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
decide
whether
it
should
reach
that
issue,
based
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case,
and
it
may
well
say--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--it
may
well
save
itself
some
work
in
the
future.
it
certainly
would
have
in
this
case,
if
it
had
been
decided
all
the
way
in
the
first
case,
in
the
argus
case.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
i
certainly
agree,
your
honor,
and
in
this
case,
that
was
the
case.
it
was
known
at
the
time
even
of
the
argus
appeal
that
there
were
other
cases
pending,
that
two
other
cases
were
pending
on
this,
and
that
basically
we're
back
in
the
situation
of
what
happened
under
the
triplett
case
where
a
patentee
could
go
on
asserting
its
patent
against
a
series
of
unrelated
defendants
even
it
had
been
declared
invalid
because
there
was
no
estoppel.
after
blonder-tongue,
when
this
court
created...
changed
the
rule
and
allowed
the
future
defendants
to
assert
res
judicata
against
the
patent
owner,
then
you
would
take...
you
allowed
future
defendants
to
defend
based
on
the
previous
invalidity
of
the
patent
by
the
patent
owner,
but
in
effect,
because
the
federal
circuit
does
not
reach
the
issue
of
validity,
it
returns
the
patent
that
has
been
found
invalid
to
the
patent
owner,
he
can
go
out
and
reassert
it
again,
and
the
patent
defendant
is
in
a
worse
position
because
he
can't
even
use
the
first
judgment
of
invalidity
against
the
patent--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--because
it's
been
vacated,
and
the
only
way
he
can
really
get
a
judgment
is
if
he's
first
found
to
be
infringing,
and
then
presumably
the
court
would
reach
the
issue
of
validity.
so
in
this
case,
since
we
find
that
there
was
a
case
of
controversy,
no
question
about
that.
the
important
point
we
think
next
that
the
court
should
consider
is
the
court's
policies
that
were
announced
in
the
sinclair
case
and
the
blonder-tongue
case.
in
sinclair,
this
court
said
that
of
the
two
issues
the
validity
issue
is
the
more
important.
the
decision
on
invalidity
tends
to
discourage
future
suits,
saves
judicial
resources,
parties'
resources,
leaves
the
field
of
invention
open
to
others
knowing
that
they
will
not
be
threatened
with
this
patent.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
to
the
federal
circuit,
your
honor?
mr.
charles
f.
schill
i
think
really
perhaps
going
back
they
seem
to
be
depending
upon
this
court's
judgment
in
the
altvater
case,
and
i
think
what
has
taken
the
court
off-track
is
the
statement
in
that
case
that
says
that
because
there
were
additional
claims
and
devices
at
issue
there
was
proper
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
is
minimal.
that's
an
exemplary...
either
an
exemplary
issue,
or
should
be
limited
to
the
position
of...
there
was
in
extent
at
that
point,
which
was
licensee
estoppel.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
well,
for...
i
think
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
is
as
broad
as
whatever
fits
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
and
so
long
as
there
is
a
case
of
controversy
under
that
act,
then
there
is
a
right
to
have
a
determination
made,
and
by
exemplary,
i
meant
a
case,
or
additional
claims
or
devices
is
one
example
of
when
there
is
still
a
controversy
between
the
parties.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
that's
the
only
learning
i
can
get
from
their
view
in
the
vieau
v.
japax
case.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
instruction
from
this
court
that
the
altvater
case
should
not
be
limited
to
the
case
of
that
was
licensee
estoppel,
really,
that
was
in
extent
at
that
point
in
time,
and
clarification
that
the
jurisdiction,
so
long
as
there
is
adequate
jurisdiction
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
that
issue
should
be
decided
so
long
as
it
is
necessary
to
resolve
the
conflict
between
the
parties.
for
example,
i
think
that
if
the
case
arrived
at
the
federal
circuit
and
the
patent
had
just
expired,
the
court
found
noninfringement,
there's
probably
no
reason
for
it
to
go
on
and
reach
the
validity
issue.
the
same
would
happen...
if
the
court
had
decided
an
unenforceability
issue
at
least
as
to
that
party,
or
perhaps
as
to
the
world
on
that
patent,
it
no
longer
need
reach
the
validity
issue
for
other...
for
any
other
reason,
so
that
those
would
be
situations
where
the
court
should
exercise
its
discretion
and
not
decide,
and
there
may
even
be
instances
that
i
haven't
thought
of
yet
where
the
noninfringement
would
be
an
adequate
resolution
of
all
the
issues
in
the
case,
but
the
court
should
be
left
with
the
scope
to
determine
what
those
situations
are.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
it
was...
well,
judge
lourie
wrote
a
concurring
opinion
saying
that
he
would
have
reached
the
invalidity
issue
in
this
case
and
found
the
patent
invalid.
the
other
two
judges
wrote
separately
and
would
have
found...
did
not
reach
that
issue.
they
just
cited
vieau
v.
japax.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
we
had
requested
an
en
banc
ruling,
and
three
of
the
judges
would
have
allowed
the
en
banc
hearing,
including
chief
judge
nies.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
yes,
it
did.
it
was
judge
lourie,
judge
nies,
and
judge
rich,
i
believe,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
it
has
not,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
that's
correct.
they
have...
beginning
in
1987,
this
was...
this
policy
was
adopted
and
continued
since
then.
in
each
case,
they
only
appear
to
cite
the
vieau
v.
japax
case
and
not
give
any
further
explanation
of
their
reasons
for
making
a
decision
in
that--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--i
think...
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
how
to
respond
to
that,
your
honor.
i
think
certainly
that
would--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--since
i
appear
before
the
court,
i'd
like
to...
i
do
believe
that
this
court's
teachings
in
the
precedent
we've
cited
in
sinclair
and
blonder-tongue
should
play
an
important
role
in
coming
to
the
decisions
of
whether
to
reach
invalidity
in
each
case.
i
think
it's
of
paramount
public
interest,
especially...
in
this
case,
i
find,
you
know,
a
situation
that
i
found
difficult
to
deal
with
all
through
the
case.
it's
hard
to
tell
your
client
that
you
have
to
go
back
to
trial
on
a
patent
that's
already
been
found
invalid
merely
because
that
issue
was
not
reached
by
the
federal
circuit
and
given
finality.
and
to
have
the
patent
twice
declared
invalid
on
the
exact
same
basis
to
me
convinces
me
that
there
was
no
error,
that
this
is
a
tremendous
waste
of
resources
for
a
very
small
company,
and
is
something
that
will
continue
to
happen,
we
believe,
or
could
at
least
happen,
something
that
is
worth
spending
some
judicial
time
to
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
in
the
first
instance,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
lower
courts
have
the
duty
to
decide
whether
there's
a
case
or
controversy.
so
long
as
they've
made
that
decision,
then
the
federal
circuit
i
think
is
in
the
position
of
a
reviewing
court
deciding
whether
the
lower
court
has
properly
made
its
decision
on
the
existence
of
the
case
or
controversy.
so
long
as
that
review
convinces
it
that
the
lower
court
was
correct,
then
i
think
it
should
reach
the
invalidity
issue
as
long
as
its
raised
by
counterclaim,
because
the
defendant
is
left
without
its
remedy
to
resolve
the
conflict,
the
uncertainty
between
the
parties.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
the
only
two
that
i've
been
able
to
come
up
with
so
far,
your
honor,
are
the
issue,
for
example,
where
the
patent
has
expired
somewhere
around
the
time
of
the
appeal,
and
to
decide
that
issue
would
really
be
a
moot
point.
the
other
would
be,
for
example,
if
there
was
a
finding
of
unenforceability
of
the
patent.
also,
that
issue
would
be
redundant.
it
would
give
relief...
it
would
not
give
any
additional
relief
than
the
finding
of
noninfringement.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
unenforceability,
there
are
a
couple
of
different
circumstances
of
unenforceability.
it
may
just
be
unenforceable
because
of
equitable
factors
against
the
particular
defendant.
another
unenforceable...
reason
for
finding
unenforceability
is--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--inequitable
conduct
before
the
patent
office,
which
would
make
the
patent
perhaps
invalid
or
unenforceable
against
any
person.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
yes.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
i
agree
your
honor,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
public
interest--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--i
don't
think
the
factors
would
require--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--yes,
but
i
don't
see
that
there
is
a
need
to
resolve
the
particular
conflict
before
the
court
to
decide
that
issue,
only
from
a
societal
need
to
try--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--yes,
i
think
that
is
a
different
situation,
your
honor,
and
the
trial
court
has
before
it
the
closest...
is
closest
to
the
facts
of
the
case
and
knows
when
they're...
or,
how
to
judge
whether--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--the
controversy
is
real
between
the
parties
or
not.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
no,
and
i--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--well,
the
declaratory
judgment
act
is
discretionary,
so
even
though
there
is
a
case
or
controversy,
to
me
it
seems
as
if
that--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--no.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
that's
correct.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
no,
i
wouldn't--
mr.
charles
f.
schill
--yes,
your
honor.
i
think,
to
sum
up,
in
a
sense
we
think
that
the
court
should
consider
as
factors,
your
honor,
that
part
of
its
responsibility
is
to
effectuate
the
purpose
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
to
relieve
the
parties
from
uncertainty,
insecurity,
and
controversy,
to
prevent
the
misallocation
of
resources
which
occurs
when
the
litigation
of
the
patents
found
invalid
is
allowed...
that
is,
relitigation
of
those
patents...
and
that
they
should
reach
the
more
important
issue
of
patent
validity
in
their
deliberations.
this
would
allow...
and
you
would
allow
relitigation
of
patents
only
under
the
terms
of
blonder-tongue.
that
is,
only
when
the
patent
owner
has
not
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
the
validity
issue,
otherwise,
its
rights
have
been
protected,
and
its
right
to
continue
asserting
the
patents
should
not
be
renewed
by
the
court's
refusal
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
issue.
so...
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
portion
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
to
me,
it
just
seems
as
if
the
interpretation
they
felt
was
necessary
to
interpret
altvater
in
these
situations
led
to
the
practice,
that
they
were
trying
to...
you
know,
preserve
judicial
economy
so
that
they
did
not
have
to
keep
litigating
the
issue,
but
i
don't
think
it
saves
judicial
time
in
the
long
run.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
thank
you.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
i
think
i
would
just
like
to
make
two
points.
first,
the
presumption
of
validity
that's
been
discussed
seems
to
be
imbued
with
some
substantive
right
by
morton.
it
really
is
only
a
procedural
device
to
put
the
burden
of
proof
of
invalidity
on
the
person
attacking
the
patent,
and
i
think
that
should
be
kept
in
mind
when
you're
deciding
whether
there
is
some
kind
of
unfairness
of
not
deciding
that
issue,
or
deciding
invalidity
and
then
not
going
on
to
reach
the
merits.
the
difference
we
have
with
morton
is
that
if
the
counterclaim,
or
if
the
invalidity
is
raised
only
as
an
affirmative
defense,
we
don't
believe
the
court
necessarily
must
reach
that
issue,
and
in
conclusion,
i
believe
that
we
would
request
this
court
to
remand
the
case
to
the
federal
circuit
with
the
direction
that
they
reach
the
issue
of
validity
and
reach
the
merits
substantively
on
that
issue.
mr.
charles
f.
schill
thank
you,
your
honor.
