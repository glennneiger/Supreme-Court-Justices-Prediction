mr.
gordon
r.
coons
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
response
to
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
posed,
within
the
confines
of
the
specific
facts
of
this
case
there
is
no
difference
whatsoever
between
the
position
of
petitioner
and
respondent.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
that
is
correct.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
there
certainly
is,
and
there
is
also
a
major
dispute
with
regard
to
those
situations
in
which
the
appellate
court,
the
federal
circuit,
should
decide
validity.
i
think
we
differ
both
in
terms
of
analysis
and
in
result,
and
respondent's
position
is
quite
clear,
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
1971
in
blonder-tongue,
that
what
is
required
there
is
a
fundamental
right,
on
appeal,
to
decide
the
validity
issue
on
the
merits,
and
that
must
be
done
in
every
case
because
of
the
public
interest
that
this
court
recognized
in
that
case.
that
obviously
goes
beyond
the
facts
of
this
particular
case,
because
as
has
been
pointed
out,
this
case
does
involve
a
situation
in
which
there
is
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
in
fact,
it
is
probably
the
rare
case
in
which
a
defendant
infringer
does
not
interpose
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
but
conceptually,
the
reason
why
the
federal
circuit
should
address
the
validity
issue
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
there
is
the
presence
of
a
declaratory
judgment
count
or
not.
it's
really
bottomed
in
this
court's
analysis
in
the
blonder-tongue
case,
and
it's
kind
of
interesting
to
look
at
the
position
of
the
petitioners
and
the
respondent
in
that
case,
because
in
both
of
their
briefs,
neither
petitioner
nor
the
respondent
urged
that
the
triplett
rule
which
was
then
in
effect
ought
to
be
modified
in
any
respect.
in
fact,
what
they
said
is
the
triplett
rule
should
be
maintained,
and
in
this
court's
blonder-tongue
decision,
it
stated
in
petitioners'
brief
at
page
12,
"though
petitioners
stand
to
gain
by
any
such
result,
we
cannot
urge
the
destruction
of
a
long-accepted
safeguard
for
patentees
merely
for
the
expediency
of
victory.
"
and
that
safeguard
that
was
referenced
in
that
was
the
safeguard
against
an
improvident
judgment
of
invalidity,
because
under
the
triplett
rule,
it
really
made
no
difference
whether
the
patent
was
held
valid
or
invalid
except
with
respect
to
the
particular
parties,
because
in
that
setting
it
would
be
res
judicata
as
between
the
particular
parties.
but
beyond
that,
if
there
was
another
party
who
was
believed
to
infringe,
then
a
second
suit
could
be
had,
so
that
safeguard
was
the
ability
on
the
part
of
the
patent
owner
to
file
multiple
lawsuits.
and
what
this
court
decided
in
blonder-tongue
was
no,
that
is
not
proper.
there
is
a
public
interest
in
deciding
validity
of
patents,
and
what
should
be
done
is
to
provide
the
patent
owner
with
one
full
and
fair
opportunity,
and
respondents
submit
that
that
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
inherently
includes
the
right
to
a
decision
on
appeal
with
respect
to
the
merits
of
the
validity
issue.
it
doesn't
make
any
difference--
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
--that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
you
mean
fool
with
noninfringement?
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
i
think
that
the
better
practice
certainly...
it's
almost
one
of
false
economy,
because
i
think
the
federal
circuit
practice
is
well-rooted,
in
fact,
to
have
the
trial
courts
decide
both
issues,
because
if
the
decision
is
deemed
to
be
inappropriate
on
validity,
for
example,
which
before
this
vieau
v.
japax
procedure...
and
that's
part
of
the
problem,
that
literally
as
many
times
as
not,
that
trial
court
holding
of
invalidity
was
reversed,
and
so
in
those
50
percent
of
the
cases
the
problem
would
be
that
not
having
decided
infringement,
then
back
down
the
case
would
go--
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
--and
certainly
that
sort
of
piecemeal
litigation
would
be...
i
think
would
take
up
more
judicial
time
than
it
would
take
to
simply
do
it
all
at
once.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
i
think
that's
correct.
i'm
aware
of
certain
situations
in
which
bifurcation
is
done,
for
example,
and
issues
are
decided
one
by
one,
but
in
virtually
every
case
i
think
the
practice
is
that
the
district
court
does
decide
both
issues.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
and
i
think
that
certainly
could
be
done
by
the
exercise
of
judicial
restraint,
and
like
any
court
which
is
not
a
court
of
last
resort,
the
problem
would
be
that
what
may
be
entirely
clear
to
that
trial
court,
the
appellate
court
may
decide
that's
not
the
case
and
then
send
it
back
down
for
validity,
but
certainly
within
the
exercise
of
judicial
restraint,
in
the
first
instance,
if
it
is
that
clear,
i
think
that
the
trial
court
has
the
discretion
to
decide
that
issue
or
not,
but
eventually--
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
--that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
well,
i
think
i
misspoke,
because
i
think
there
would
be
discretion
to
do
so,
but
if
you...
once
there
is
an
appeal
and
the
issue
has
been...
well,
let
me
backtrack
on
that.
i
think
in
those
circumstances,
if
non...
if
validity
was
never
decided,
then
it
has
never
been
put
to
issue,
so
i
think
that
both
the...
go
back
and
i
agree
with...
i
guess
my
position
is
the
same,
that
if
validity
has
never
been
decided,
it's
never
been
put
into
issue,
then
i
don't
think
blonder-tongue
would
come
into
play,
and
the
federal
circuit
would
have
the
same
discretion
that
the
trial
court
would,
because
an
infringement
would
decide
the
issue.
but
if
validity
is
put
into
play,
and
there
is
a
contest
between
that,
then...
by
the
trial
court,
then
under
our
position,
as
respondents,
blonder-tongue
requires
a
consideration
of
the
validity
issue
upon
appeal
in
any
instance,
except
for
the
rare
situation
in
which,
for
example,
a
patent
has
expired
and
which,
under
what
has
been
called
prudential
mootness,
the
issue
of
whether
the
patent
is
valid
or
not
is
so
attenuated
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
it
would
be
imprudent
to
then
go
ahead
and
consider
that
issue
and
go
ahead.
but
other
than
that
sort
of
a
circumstance,
if
validity
has
been
put
into
issue,
then
it
becomes
part
of
the
case
or
controversy
and
must
be
decided.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
i
don't
think
it
would
really
make
any
difference.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
but
even
if
that
were
done,
and
even
if
there
were
a
decision
of...
that
the
patent
was
valid,
technically
it's
the
defendant's
burden,
so
the
holding
would
be
that
there
has
not
been
that
clear
and
convincing
showing
that
the
patent
was
not
valid.
but
even
if
that
were
affirmed,
all
that
does
is
decide
the
issue
as
between
the
parties,
because
there
is
no
mutuality
with
respect
to
validity,
and
every
time
there
is
a
presumption
of
validity
that
certainly
should
be
attached,
but
the
very
next
lawsuit
it
doesn't
buy
a
patent
owner
anything
to
have
selected
that
target
because
every
case
is
independent.
the
patent
owner
puts
the
patent
on
the
line
every
time.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
now,
another
point--
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
--cares
about
the
issue
of
validity?
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
no,
i...
if
i
did,
i
spoke
in
error
because
i
think
in
blonder-tongue
there's
a
third
party,
and
that
is
the
public.
the
public
has
an
interest
in
patents,
and
i
think
that
that
issue
is
something
that--
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
--well,
that's
what
we--
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
--it
certainly
can
be
relitigated,
but
there
is
a
situation
in
which,
if
you
do
not
resolve
validity
and
you
follow
the
federal
circuit
practice
as
has
been
done
here...
stepping
back
in
point
of
time,
the
federal
circuit
has
been
around
for
well
over
10
years,
and
prior
to
1986,
in
'87
when
this
vieau
practice
came
into
play,
they
had
decided
routinely
both
validity
and
infringement.
and
in
those
cases
statistically,
almost
as
many
times
as
not,
the
patents
that
were
held
valid
by
the
district
court
were
reversed
on
appeal...
or,
excuse
me,
the
patents
that
were
held
invalid
about
50
percent
of
the
time
were
reversed
on
appeal
and
the
patent
was
held
valid.
and
i
think
that
what
came
out
of
blonder-tongue
and
why
it's
important
to
the
public
is
that
there
ought
to
be
some
certainty
of
result
once
the
validity
issue
has
been
raised
so
that
you
can
distinguish
between
patents
in
which
the
validity
claim
has
not
been
established
and
those
in
which
the
invalidity
claim
was
in
fact
correct,
and
to
the
extent
that
there
were
"scarecrow
patents"
or
the
like,
that
those
patents
should
be
out
of
the
rolls.
the
public
should
not
have
to
face--
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
--it
can
only
be
relitigated
if
the
validity
of
the
patent
is
restored,
or
is
determined
on
appeal.
if
it
isn't,
that
issue
can
certainly
come
up
again
and...
but
that
would
be
left,
then,
to
another
lawsuit,
and
that
would
be
part
of
the
multiple
litigation
in
which
this
50
percent
of
the
patents
that
would
have
been
held
invalid
then
are
still
on
the
rolls,
if
you
will,
and
it
takes
another
lawsuit,
another
allocation
of
resources,
to
deal
with
the
issue.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
that
is
the
end,
that's
right.
once--
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
i
think
that's
a
good
question.
i
don't
know.
i
can't
recall,
as
i'm
standing
here
if
i
can
ever...
if
i
can
think
of
the
case
in
which
the...
the
federal
circuit
has
looked
at
the
issue
of
validity
on
two
different
occasions.
i
am
aware
of
situations
in
which
a
patent
has
been
held
valid
in
one
case
and
then
held
invalid
in
a
second
or
third
case,
and
i
think...
so
there
are
those
sorts
of
situations,
i
just
don't
know
if
the
federal
circuit
has
itself
dealt
with
that
sort
of
an
issue.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
well,
i
think
it
certainly...
i
think
it
certainly
could,
and
there
certainly
is
a
distinction
between
whether
a
patent
has
been
held
invalid
in
the
trial
court
or
whether
it
has
been
held
valid.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
that
certainly...
that
certainly
is
the
case,
but
if
you
follow
blonder-tongue
and
you
look
at
the
concept
of
wanting
to
provide
one
full
and
fair
opportunity,
that
includes
the
right
to
appeal
on
the
merits,
because
just
as
the
trial
court
could
be
wrong
on
either
of
that,
you
prevent
that
sort
of
a
situation
and
it
could
be
that
the
valid
holding
was
incorrect
and
the
patent
should
be
held
invalid.
certainly
there
is
a
presumption
of
validity,
and
it's
less
of
a
problem,
but
if,
in
fact,
patents
are
imbued
with
a
public
interest
that
is
throughout
this
court's
opinion
in
blonder-tongue,
then
conceptually
it
should
not
make
any
difference
whether
the
trial
court's
decision
was
valid
or
invalid,
it
ought
to
be
considered
on
appeal.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
not
insofar
as
blonder-tongue
is
concerned
and
in
our
position
with
respect
to
considering
that
issue
on
appeal.
i
think
that
it
ought
to
be
considered
in
either
event,
because
if
patents
do
in
fact
have
a
public
interest,
and
certainly
respondents
contend
that
both
good
patents
and
bad
patents
ought
to
be
identified
and
there
ought
to
be
a
separation
between
the
two,
and
that
the
issue
ought
to
be
resolved,
then
blonder-tongue
would
say
regardless
of
whether...
how
the
infringement
issue
was
decided,
the
validity
issue
ought
to
be
decided
on
appeal.
now,
obviously,
by
exercising
judicial
restraint
and
the
like
and
in
the
management
of
legal
issues,
to
conserve
their
time
the
federal
circuit
may
choose
to
decide
the
validity
issue
first,
as
judge
lourie
had
suggested.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
i
think
it
differs
in
the
respect
with
which
we
were
just
discussing.
on
the
limited
issue
before
this
court,
where
there
is
a
declaratory
judgment
held,
we
do
not
have
any
difference
whatsoever.
but
our
contention
is
that
this
court
is
faced
with
in
effect
rationalizing
its
cumulative
precedent.
altvater,
electrical
fittings,
and
blonder-tongue,
and
that
in
our
position
it
really
is
immaterial
whether
there
is
a
declaratory
judgment
count
or
not.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
or
just
an
affirmative
defense.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
that's
correct.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
i
think
the
federal
circuit
practice
and
what
we've
all
more
or
less
grown
up
with
is
a
situation
in
which
trial
courts
have
in
fact
exercised
their
discretion
and
have
in
fact
considered
both
issues,
and
i
think
the
reason
is
to
attempt
to
avoid
piecemeal--
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
--litigation,
because
if
they
happen
to
be
wrong
on
the
issue
that
they
decide...
infringement,
for
example,
then
what
happens
is
you
then
go
back
and
you
have
to
decide
something
else
when
it's
not
fresh,
it
takes
more
time
and
all
that
sort
of
thing,
and--
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
--and
i
think
that...
and
i
don't
contend
to
the
contrary.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
you
are
correct.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
well,
i
think
it
depends
on...
i
think
i
would
be
certainly
satisfied
with
that
result,
but
i
think
this
is
an
opportunity
for
this
court
to
provide
some
definitive
bright
line
approach
that
would,
i
think,
satisfy
all
the
parties.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
oh,
i
think
district
courts
can
take
care
of
themselves
right
now.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
oh,
i'm
sure
that
that
happens.
i
think
in
this
case
to
resolve
it
i'm
looking
at
the
federal
circuit
practice,
and
i
think
that
the
answer...
you
were
quite
right
that
oftentimes
the
validity
issue
and
infringement
issue
are
intertwined
and
you
have
to
interpret
the
claims,
and
that's
something
which
has
to
be
done
in
any
event.
and
if
that
is
not
done,
and
is
not
done
properly,
it's
part
of
what
we
think
has
occurred
here,
what
happens
is
that
you
begin
to
meld
the
issues
together,
and
it
does
affect
the
thinking,
and
so
i
think
that
that
certainly
has
to
be
done.
and
it
is
a
rare
case
in
which
a
declaratory
judgment
count
is
not
there,
so
in
terms
of
result
we're
probably
not
talking
about
a
lot
of
cases,
but
in
terms
of
approach,
what
i
submit
is
that
the
blonder-tongue
decision
requires
a
consideration
of
validity
when
the
trial
court
exercises
discretion
to
decide
that
issue,
whether
it's
decided
valid
or
not.
and
i
think
anything
short
of
that
would
be
a
retreat
from
the
sort
of
principles
that
were
nec...
that
were,
excuse
me,
enunciated
in
blonder-tongue,
and
i
think
that
what
we've
seen,
that
the
concern
about
the
safeguard
over
the
20
years,
has
certainly
been
something
that
has
been
put
to
rest.
i
think
everyone
is
comfortable
with
the
situation
of
one
full
and
fair
opportunity.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
i
haven't
made
a
survey.
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
i
was
hoping
you
weren't
going
to
put
me
in
that
situation,
but
all
i
can
say
by
way--
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
--well,
i
think
that
the
point
is
that
certainly
from
the
amici,
from
the
american
bar
association,
the
american
intellectual
property
law
association,
and
from
the
federal
circuit
bar
association,
you
see
a
unanimity
of
view
that
this
practice
is
not
something
that
everybody
is
fond
of
and
that
it
feels--
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
--well,
i
have
been...
this
is
all
hearsay,
and
perhaps
it's
not
admissible
at
this
stage,
but
i
have
been
told
that
judge
bennett's
law
clerk,
and
he
wrote
the
concurring
opinion
in
the
vieau
v.
japax--
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
--i
stand
corrected.
he
drafted
the
opinion.
but
at
any
rate,
what
i'm
told
is
that
he
believes
that
that
was
proper,
and
i'm
sure
that
it
was--
mr.
gordon
r.
coons
--but
i
think
that
we're...
from
my
point
of
view,
that
one
of
the
things
that
frankly
i
have
not
found
any
precedent
that
is
squarely
on
point,
but
it's
the
issue
of,
we
have
article
3
case
or
controversy,
we
have
prudential
mootness,
and
we
have
mootness
being
thrown
around
oftentimes
a
little
bit
loosely,
and
i
submit
that
a
court
such
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit,
which
is
not
a
court
of
last
resort,
cannot
itself,
by
its
own
action,
create
either
jurisdictional
mootness,
nor
can
it
create
prudential
mootness.
if
prudential
mootness
occurs
in
a
situation
where
it's
a
happenstance
through
some
extrinsic
fact,
something
which
was
in
dispute,
a
report,
or
whatever,
was
issued,
a
bankruptcy
plan
which
has
already
gone
so
far
along
in
reorganization
that
it
would
be
nonsensical
to
provide
relief,
those
are
the
sorts
of
prudential
mootness
issues
that
come
up.
but
there
is
no
situation
in
which
a
court
which
is
not
a
court
of
last
resort
can
by
its
own
action
create
a
situation
in
which
the
case
is
moot,
whether
you
look
at
that
as
jurisdictionally
moot
or
as
prudentially
moot,
and
i
think
that
that
perhaps
is
where
the
error
came
into
play.
i
think
that
the
only
thing
that
i
would...
additional
point
that
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
you
look
at
this
from
the
standpoint
of
the
patent
owner,
and
part
of
the
problem
when
you
have
the
federal
circuit
practice
is
what
has
occurred
here.
you
have
one
half
of
an
opportunity
to
litigate,
which
is
accorded
to
morton
in
the
argus
case,
you
have
one-half
of
an
opportunity
to
litigate
which
was
accorded
in
the
cardinal
case,
and
the
problem
is
that
this
is
one
situation
in
which
one-half
of
an
opportunity
and
one-half
of
an
opportunity
does
not
end
up
to
be
one
full
opportunity,
that
one-half
of
an
opportunity
may
satisfy
the
cynical
patent
owner
who
only
wants
to
save
his
or
her
patents,
but
that
same
one-half
of
an
opportunity
only
serves
to
wholly
frustrate
a
responsible
patent
owner
as
morton,
who
believes
an
erroneous
trial
court
decision
was
reached
and
would
like
to
have
that
rectified
on
appeal.
thank
you
very
much.
