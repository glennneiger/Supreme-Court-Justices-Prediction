justice
byron
r.
white
if
it
decided
the
validity
issue,
it
would
save
itself
a
lot
of
work
in
the
future,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
no
matter...
no.
no
matter
which
way
you
decided
the
validity
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
just
ask,
wouldn't
it
save
itself
some
work
in
the
future?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it's
been
vacated.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we
agree
with
you
and
your
colleague
that
the...
if
we
agree
with
you
there
should
have
been
a
decision,
what
do
we
say,
abuse
of
discretion,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
what
do
we
say
their
error
is,
other
than,
you
should
have
decided
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
original
case
felt
bound
to
come
out
that
way
under
our
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
do
you
think
they've...
if
we
thought
they
misconstrued
those
cases,
do
you
think
if
we
disabused
them
of
their
error
that
they
would
then
decide
the
validity
issue,
or
would
they
say,
why
should
we
fool
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
vote
in
the
federal
circuit?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
some
suggestion
of
en
banc?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
that
include
the
dissenting
judge
in
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
whether
they
should
have
decided
the
issue--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
there's
a
major
dispute
between
you
on
validity.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
say
that
if
a...
the
district
court,
when
it's
faced
with
claims...
infringement
claims
and
claims
on
the
other
side
of
invalidity,
has
to
decide
them
both.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
maybe
just
decide...
maybe
you
get
to
validity
first,
then
you
don't
have
to
fool
with
invalidity,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
noninfringement.
you
don't
have--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
your
position
would
be
the
district
court,
if
there's
a
validity
issue
presented,
it
should
be
decided.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
make
any
difference
as
long...
if
validity's
at
issue,
and
infringement
is
at
issue
in
a
trial
court,
would
it
make
any
difference
whether
the
patent
was
held
to
be
infringed
or
noninfringed?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
want
us
to
talk
about
what
district
courts
should
do
and
all
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right,
so
you
don't
insist
that
we
give
the
district
courts
a
lot
of
advice.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
most
patent
lawyers
around
the
country
agree
with
you?
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
that's
why
we
didn't
get
an
amicus
in
this
case.
we
couldn't
find
one
to
argue
the
other
side.
