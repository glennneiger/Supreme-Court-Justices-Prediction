we'll
hear
argument
now
in
92-114,
cardinal
chemical
company
v.
morton
international.
mr.
schill.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
still
an
underlying
dispute,
of
course,
as
to
the
validity
vel
non
and
infringement
vel
non
of
the
patent,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
an
exemplary
issue?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
an
e.g.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schill,
it
seems
to
me
the
formula
that
you're
suggesting
we
adopt,
or
the
rule,
has
enough
imponderables
and
exceptions
in
it
that
it's
not
going
to
be
too
much
guidance
for
the
federal
circuit.
we're
just
going
to
end
up
saying,
you
should
have
decided
the
validity
of
the
patent
in
this
particular
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
are
the
situations
in
which
you
say
that
the
federal
circuit
need
not
reach
the
validity
issue?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
coons.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wherein
does
your
position
differ
from
mr.
schill's
in
this
respect,
mr.
coons?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
just
an
affirmative
defense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
the
validity
should
be
decided
in
either
event--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--by
the
federal
circuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean,
he
drafted
it,
yes.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
coons.
mr.
schill,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schill.
chief
justice
william
h.

the
case
is
submitted.
