justice
antonin
scalia
if
that
would
work,
what's
wrong
with
that?
why
isn't
that
a
good
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
to
say
that
it
has
discretion
is
not
to
say
that
it
cannot
exercise
its
discretion
on
a
generic
basis,
and
to
draw
up
entire
categories
of
cases
in
which
it
will
simply
decide
that
it
should
not
go
any
further,
and
i
think
this
court
has
said
one
large
category
is
when
the
issue
makes
no
difference
to
the
judgment
below,
and
it's
a
complex
patent
case.
we
don't
want
to
have
to
spend
the
time
figuring
out
the
answer
to
the
patent
question
when
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
judgment
below.
why
isn't
that
perfectly
reasonable?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
you
have
a
much
stronger
case
with
respect
to
the
counterclaim,
declaratory
judgment
action,
but
just
talk
for
a
minute
about
the
no
counterclaim,
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
an
affirmative
defense.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
really
makes
no
difference
to
the
decision
below
whether
the
appellate
court
goes
on
to
review
the
invalidity
determination
or
not,
and
why
should
it
expend
its
energy
on
that
question?
i
mean,
of
course
you
can
say,
well,
it'll
make
difference
to
parties
in
future
cases.
of
course
it
will,
but
courts
don't
usually
do
things
for
that
reason
unless
it
affects
the
parties
in
front
of
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
it
may.
i
think...
let's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
concede
it
may,
but
why
should
it?
i
think
you
further
take
the
position
it
should,
don't
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
you
don't
care?
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
this
issue
has
never
really
been
addressed
by
the
federal
circuit
en
banc.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
just
have
a
long
series
of
panel
decisions
that...
so
this
is
the
law
of
the
circuit,
and
they
looked
at
their--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
you'd
say
the
trial
court
is
the
same
as
far
as
the
counterclaim
is
concerned.
as
far
as
the
declaratory
judgment
action
is
concerned
there's
no
more
basis
for
the
trial
court
to
dodge
that
bullet
than
there
is
for
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
can
understand
on
the
defense,
if
the
trial
court
wants
to
just
find
no
infringement
it
may
decide
not
to
go
ahead
with
the
invalidity
as
a
defense,
but
if
there's
a
separate
claim,
a
counterclaim
on
invalidity,
can
the
trial
court
just
say
there's
no
infringement
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
case
dismissed?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
be
sure,
but
is
a
proper
basis
for
exercising
that
discretion
merely
that
you
have
dismissed
an
accompanying
infringement
action--
justice
antonin
scalia
--anymore
than
it
would
if
you
brought
the
declaratory
judgment
action
separately,
when
there
had
been
no
infringement
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
can't
imagine...
can
you
say
you
can
always
dismiss
a
declaratory
judgment
action
for
infringement,
in
your
discretion,
with
no
other
reason
than
it
is
a
declaratory
judgment
action
for
infringement?
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly
not.
then
why
can
you
do
it
simply
because
it
happens
to
be
attached
to
a...
not
infringement,
invalidity.
why
can
you
do
it
simply
because
it
happens
to
be
attached
to
an
infringement
action?
i
can't
understand
that.
in
other
words,
there's
the
same
unflagging
obligation
to
pursue
a
declaratory
judgment
action
as
there
is
an
injunction
action,
that's
the
position.
virtually
unflagging.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
at
least,
then,
there's
no
reason
to
go
forward
if
you
don't
think
that
this
particular
alleged
infringer
cares
about
the
issue
anymore,
right,
so
it
isn't
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
i
mean,
you've
just
said
it
really
is
only
important
as
to
those
two
parties.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
public
isn't
affected.
you
tell
me
later
lawsuits
are
later
lawsuits.
there's
the
presumption
of
validity
that
it
acquires,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
issue
can
be
relitigated,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i'm
saying
is,
i
don't
understand
what
that
means
if
you
say
the
whole
thing
can
be
relitigated
again
in
the
next
case,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say,
if
you
lose
on
invalidity,
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you
win
on
invalidity,
you're
going
to
have
to
keep
on
litigating
it,
no
matter
what.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
suppose
the
appellate
court
is
dealing
with
a
case
in
which
the
district
court
has
found
the
patent
to
be
valid.
why
can't
the
appellate
court
say,
well,
there's
really
not
much
use
in...
if
i
vacate
the
decision
below
without
ruling
on
the
validity
issue,
i'm
really
not
depriving
anybody
of
anything,
because
that
validity
would
be
relitigable
anyway
in
the
next
case.
why
isn't
that
a
situation
where,
in
the
sound
exercise
of
its
discretion,
the
court
of
appeals
might
say,
i'll
just
leave
it
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
invalid
is
a
stronger
case
for
getting
to
it
on
appeal,
a
much
stronger
case,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
least
where
it's
been...
well,
of
course,
where
it's
been
decided
by
the
lower
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
when
you
were
speaking
earlier
about
when
the
lower
court
had
to
decide
it
in
your
view
and
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
decide
it,
were
you
assuming
that
there
was
a
declaratory
judgment
counterclaim
or
not,
because
frankly
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
up
to
the
district
judge
how
many
issues
he
wants
to
resolve.
i'm
not
inclined
to
say
that
he
has
to
resolve
two
issues
if
one
will
get
rid
of
the
case,
but
when
there's
a
declaratory
judgment
claim,
i
feel
a
little
bit
differently
about
it.
were
you
addressing
the
declaratory
judgment
claim
only,
or
do
you
assert
that
even
when
there's
only
an
affirmative
defense
the
district
court
has
an
obligation
to
reach
the
invalidity
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
but
you
can
say
that
in
a
lot
of
different
contexts
in
a
lot
of
different
other
lawsuits,
and
i
don't
know
any
rule
that
says
a
district
judge
has
to
decide
anymore
than
is
minimally
necessary
to
resolve
the
dispute.
i
don't
know
why
this
area
would
be
any
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
anyone
that
doesn't
agree
with
you
that
we
can
get
up
here
to
argue
the
other
side?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
say
yes,
but
i
don't
respect
him,
right?
[laughter]
