mr.
schill,
what's
the
difference
between
unenforceability
and
invalidity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
mean
like--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
but
that
would
be...
that
makes
the
patent
invalid
in
the...
if
it's
procured
by
fraud,
doesn't
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you're
suggesting
there
might
be
a
case
where
it's
unenforceable
against
a
particular
licensee
or
particular
infringer
because
of
inequi...
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
but
i
don't
know
why
that
should
necessarily
make
the
interest
in
having
the
validity
of
the
patent
determined
for
other
parties.
i
mean,
totally--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
one
of
the
things
sinclair
talks
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
let
me
also
be
sure
i
get
the
thrust
of
your
basic
position.
you're
challenging
the
federal
circuit's
rule
when
the
district
court
has
already
decided
both
issues.
you're
not
necessarily
suggesting
that
the
district
court
would
have
the
same
duty
to
decide
validity
in
every
case.
maybe
it
would,
i
don't
know,
but
isn't
it
a
little
different
situation
when
you
already
have
a
judgment
than
when
you're
still
in
the
trial
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schill,
was
judge
markey
still
on
the
circuit
when
they
adopted
this
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
was.
thank
you,
mr.
schill.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
throw
out...
i
don't
know
if
this
really
sheds
any
light
on
anything
or
not,
but
are
there
not
some
cases
in
which
there's
a
dispute
about
how
to
interpret
the
claims,
and
if
you
interpret
the
claims
broadly
you
may
have
a
stronger
claim
of
invalidity,
or
if
you
construe
them
narrowly
there's
a
better
defense
to
the
infringement
charge,
and
so
that
you're
not
always...
i
mean,
sometimes
your
determination
of
the
merits
of
one
of
the
two
issues
may
color
your
determination
of
the
other
issue.
am
i
right
on
that,
or
is
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
and
i
don't
know
if
that
might
complicate
it,
and
i'm...
very
frankly,
one
of
the
things
that
worries
me
about
a
case
where
you
don't
have
an
adversary
on
the
precise
question
before
us,
and
much
of
the
discussion
is
about
other
cases
where
there's
an
affirmative
defense,
and
so
forth,
whether
we
really
have
any
business
talking
about
that.
the
case
before
us
seems
to
me
very
easy,
but
we've
talked
hypothetically
about
all
sorts
of
situations,
and
i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
appropriate
for
us
to
go
much
beyond
what
we
have
to
do
to
decide
this
case.
