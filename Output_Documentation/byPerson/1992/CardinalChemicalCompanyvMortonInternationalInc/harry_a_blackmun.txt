harry

mr.
schill,
how
do
you
think
the
federal
circuit
got
into
this
box?
100
years
ago,
i
was
on
a
court
of
appeals,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
question
was
always
presented
and
we
always
reversed
when
it
was
ruled
the
way
the
federal
circuit
has
done
it
here,
routinely,
and
i
would
have
thought
it
would
have
been
settled
years
ago,
but
the
federal
circuit
went
off
on
its
own
road,
didn't
it?
