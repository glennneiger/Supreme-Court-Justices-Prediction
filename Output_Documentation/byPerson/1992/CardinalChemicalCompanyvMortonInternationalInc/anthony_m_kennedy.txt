justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
do
argue--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
different
consequences
should
follow,
though.
you're
arguing
that
there's
a
difference
between
a
counterclaim
and
a
declaratory
judgment,
the
respondent's
saying
that
the
rules
should
be
the
same
in
either
case,
or
am
i
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
respondents
differ
with
you
on
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
telling
us,
or
can
you
tell
us
that
in
almost
every
instance
of
patent
litigation
in
the
district
court
the
district
court
reaches
both
issues?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
may
be
cases
in
which
the
evidence
on
infringement,
the
proof
that's
necessary
to
resolve
the
infringement
is
very
easily
managed
and
the
patent
validity
question
is
extremely
complicated,
and
that
it's
only
wise
for
the
district
court
to
proceed
to
the
infringement
issue
just
to
dispose
of
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
there
is
discretion
so
far
as
you're
concerned.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
discretion
also
in
the
appellate
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
were
to
adopt
that
rule,
is
there
any
danger
that
powerful
and
well-funded
patent-holders
could
pick
their
target
for
declaratory
relief
by
prompting
a
suit
from
an
infringer,
by
suing
an
infringer
with
very
little
assets?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
wouldn't
it?
if
i
wanted
to
test
a
patent
and
to
sue
for
infringement,
i'd
probably
pick
the
weakest
defendant
in
sight.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
each
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
will
the
court
of
appeals
on
essentially
the
same
charge
of
invalidity,
if
it
has
previously
found
a
patent
valid,
adhere
to
its
earlier
decision?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
you're
right,
that's
hearsay.
