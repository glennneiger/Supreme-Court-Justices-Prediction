justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
schill,
in
addressing
us,
i
hope
you
will
tell
us
how,
if
at
all,
your
position
differs
from
that
expressed
by
mr.
coons.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
tell
us
whether
you
think
we
have
any
controversy
here
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought,
though,
that
we
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
whether
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
errs
when
it
vacates
a
declaratory
judgment
holding
an
asserted
patent
invalid
merely
because
it
determines
that
the
patent
is
not
infringed.
now,
that's
the
question
as
framed,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
to
that
question,
is
there
any
difference
between
you
and
mr.
coons'
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
take
the
position
that
the
policy
adopted
and
now
followed
by
cafc
is
in
error,
that
it
shouldn't
follow
that
policy--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
that
seems
to
be
the
same
position
taken
by
your
opponent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
how
is
there
a
controversy,
then?
