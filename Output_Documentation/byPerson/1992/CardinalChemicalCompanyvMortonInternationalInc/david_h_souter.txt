justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
take
the
position
that
there
is
any
difference
with
respect
to
jurisdictional
mootness,
depending
on
whether
the
issue
is
raised
by
counterclaim
or
affirmative
defense?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you've
argued
very
persuasively
that
there
is
no
jurisdictional
mootness
when
the
issue
of
validity
is
raised
by
means
of
a
counterclaim.
when
the
issue
is
simply
raised
by
means
of
affirmative
defense,
does
that
make
any
difference
jurisdictionally
as
opposed
to
prudentially?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
may
be
no
right
to
have
it,
but
the
court
still
has
jurisdiction
to
render
it,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
difference
is
prudential,
rather
than
jurisdictional.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
shouldn't
it
turn,
then,
simply
on
whether
it
has
reasonable...
reason
to
believe
that
there
are
going
to
be
a
series
of
similar
cases,
and
then
if
so,
then
it
would
make
sense
prudentially
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction
and
go
ahead
and
decide
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
maybe
we
should
go
no
further
than
simply
to
say
that
it
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
exercise
no
discretion,
and
leave
it
to
them
to
work
out
criteria,
rather
than
trying
to
set
them
here
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
like
the
suggestion,
i
take
it.
