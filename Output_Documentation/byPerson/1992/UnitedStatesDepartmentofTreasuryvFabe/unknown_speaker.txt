unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
ask,
mr.
long
why
the
statute
doesn't
perhaps
meet
the
national
securities
test
since
it
is
aimed
at
protecting
directly
or
indirectly
the
relationship
between
the
insurer
and
the
insured
to
the
extent
that
it
covers
the
payout
in
the
event
of
insolvency.
i
mean,
there...
to
that
extent,
it
seems
to
perhaps
meet
the
test.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
not
the
whole
statute,
but
insofar
as
it
protects
the
insured.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
more
likely
these
days,
isn't
it?
it
might
be
a
real
concern.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
be,
but
i
still
think
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
tries
to
deal
with
this
situation,
that
it
may
very
well
be
covered
by
mccarran-ferguson.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
would
provide
something,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
which
varies
from
reorganization
or
insolvency
to
insolvency--
unknown
speaker
--you
can't
say
categorically
that
the
policyholders
might
not
be
helped
by
some
sort
of
insolvency
proceeding--
unknown
speaker
--well--
--you
said
in
your
opening
statement
that
you
were
going
to
show
that
this
was
not
the
business
of
insurance,
as
that
term
is
ordinarily
used.
i
think
if
you
take
the
term
as
ordinarily
used,
you
would
say
this
did
regulate
the
business
of
insurance.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
insolvency
may
be
the
last
step
in
the
business.
unknown
speaker
but
surely,
how
those
assets
are
disposed
of
can
very
plausibly
be
argued
to
be
a
part
of
the
business
of
insurance.
how
do
you
liquidate
an
insurance
company
when
it
goes
bust?
unknown
speaker
well,
insurance
companies
are
rated
for
solvency
and
financial
strength
all
the
time,
and
that's
one
of
the
first
things
a
policyholder
looks
to.
unknown
speaker
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
a
policyholder,
especially
a
major
policyholder,
looks
at
an
insurance
company,
he
looks
at
the
strength
of
its
assets.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
the
most...
one
of
the
most
critical
determinants
in
your
choice
of
insurance
companies,
and
your...
you
say
that
it's
irrelevant
the
moment
the
insurance
company
goes
out
of
business.
unknown
speaker
what
part
does
it
fail?
unknown
speaker
it
makes
two
out
of
three
anyway,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
because
pireno
is
explicit
on
that,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
administrative
expenses
and
wages
weren't
also
prior
to
the
united
states
claim?
unknown
speaker
but
the
policyholders
would
be
much
more
benefited
then
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
the
business
of
insurance
includes
living
up
to
their
contract
to
pay
claims--
unknown
speaker
--which
the
policy
requires
them
to
do
if
they've
got
the
assets
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
wonder
what
a
policyholder
would
say
about
that,
that
it
isn't
part
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--part
of
the
business
of
insurance
to
pay
what
he
has
been
remitting
his
premiums
for.
unknown
speaker
but
they
are
claims
against
the
insurance
company,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
a
lot
of
that
language
in
the
earlier
cases
is
dicta.
i
mean,
you
don't...
you
didn't
need
that
to
decide
those
cases.
unknown
speaker
let
me
stop
you
with
knott
for
a
second.
i
haven't
reread
that.
is
that
the
case
that
said
that
if
the
assets
had
been
in
trust,
they
would
not
have
been
part
of
the
estate.
and
so,
if
they
set
up...
the
statute
had
set
up
the
liquidation
procedure
a
little
differently,
the
united
states
could
not
have
reached
the
assets.
unknown
speaker
so,
is
the...
ultimately
at
stake
in
this
case
is
whether
the
states
perhaps
have
to
adopt
a
little
different
program
where
they
make
sure
these
assets
are
kept
in
trust
and
therefore
avoid
your
priority
claim.
unknown
speaker
while
i've
got
you
interrupted,
could
you
also
explain
to
me?
they
have
a
footnote
in
their
brief
that
points
out
that
it's
only
as
to
insurance
companies
that
this
problem
exists
because
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
the
statute
does
not
apply.
it
seems
to
me
almost
perverse
for
the
government
to
take
this
position
to
derogate
the
claims
of
policyholders
whereas
it
doesn't
as
to
general
creditors
normally.
how
does
that
all
fit
together?
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible
that
they
assumed
that
mccarran-ferguson,
even
though
i
understand
your
argument
to
the
contrary,
took
care
of
the
insurance
companies?
that
just
seems
to
me
a
senseless
distinction.
now,
maybe
there's
a
reason--
unknown
speaker
--very
well,
mr.
long.
mr.
rishel,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
that
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
i
suppose
that
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
of
a...
an
insolvent
insurance
company
is
subject
to
entirely
state
regulation
because
that's
the
business
of
insurance.
right?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
the
federal
bankruptcy
act
can't...
that
a
state
could
have
rules
that
contradict
the
federal
bankruptcy
act?
unknown
speaker
they
do
not
go
into
federal
court
at
all?
unknown
speaker
you
said
the
insurance
company
is
liable
for
claims
that
arose
before
the
insolvency?
unknown
speaker
winding
up?
unknown
speaker
the
policies?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right,
right.
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
the...
what
right
does
the
policyholder
whose
policy
has
been
cancelled
have
against
the
insurance
company?
unknown
speaker
no,
not
if
he
has
a
claim.
does
he...
say
he
hasn't
had
any
accidents
or
anything.
he
just...
normally
he
might
have
been
able
to
cancel
his
policy
and
get
a
refund.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
if
there's
any
money.
unknown
speaker
would
that
claim
be
among
the
preferred?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rishel,
how
about
the
provision
of
the
ohio
statute
giving
priority
to
general
creditors
over
the
federal
government?
how
does
that
relate
to
the
business
of
insurance
and
fall
within
the
exception?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
we
have
to
look
at
each
provision
of
the
statute
to
see
whether
it
survives,
or
do
you
think
we
have
to
look
at
it
as
a
whole?
unknown
speaker
i
gathered
from
your
brief
that
you
were
asserting
that
the
protection
of
policyholders
was
really
the
primary
purpose
of
this
liquidation
process.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
it's
pretty
hard
to
think
that
the
primary
purpose
is
protection
of
policyholders
if
you
put
some
other
claims
ahead
of
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
normal.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
it
still
cuts
into
what
the
policyholders
get.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
think
that
it
was
perfectly
proper
to...
as
a
regulation
of
insurance,
to
put
general
creditors
ahead
of
the
united
states.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
i
think
what
the
government
is
saying
is
suppose
you
have
a
licensing
law
that
requires
you
to
get
a
license
to
dispose
of
water
into
the
street
or
something,
and
any
business
that
wants
to
dispose
of
water
has
to
get
that
license.
that
would
not...
even
though
an
insurance
company
also
with
other
businesses
has
to
get
that
license,
that
would
not
be
a
law
regulating
insurance.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
the
government
means
by
the
fact
that
the
law
must
be
one
directed
at
insurance
and
not
a
general
one.
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
were
a
separate
priority
statute
just
for
insurance,
your
answer
would
be
different.
just
for
insurance
company
wind-ups.
unknown
speaker
is
the...
maybe
i'm
confused
on
something.
is
the
ohio
priority
statute
a
general
statute
which
happens
to
mention
insurance
companies,
or
does
it
apply
by
its
terms
only
to
insurance
company
bankruptcies?
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
can
say
that
the
priority
statute
is
limited
within
the
meaning
of
pireno.
unknown
speaker
yes,
okay.
unknown
speaker
--apply
to
paying
off
all
the
creditors
of
the
insurance
company
before
the
united
states
claims,
and
it
may
be
that
some
of
the
debts
that
they
owe
has
hardly
any
connection
with
an
insurance
company.
unknown
speaker
but
they
didn't
pass
before
their
federal
priority
lien
attached,
did
they?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's
also
when
the
federal
priority
lien
attached.
unknown
speaker
so,
we
have
a
tie
there.
who
wins
on--
unknown
speaker
--well,
now
you're
going
into
the
mccarran-ferguson
argument
rather
than
the
distinction
of
knott.
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
questioning
whether
you
really
had
a
valid
distinction
of
the
knott
case.
unknown
speaker
no,
and
it
did
not...
it
was
not
able
to
reach
those
deposits
in
florida
either.
unknown
speaker
the
united
states
was.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
did
the
lower
court
in
this
case
address
this
argument?
your...
i
understood
mr.
long
to
acknowledge
that
if
the
property
was
not
part
of
the
liquidation
estate,
the
united
states
would
have
no
claim.
now
you're
arguing
that
it
was
not
part
of
the
estate.
if
that's
right,
it
seems
we
don't
even
have
to
look
at
the
mccarran
act.
unknown
speaker
but
am
i
correct
that
you
are
now
arguing
that
you
win
regardless
of
how
we
construe
the
mccarran
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
pireno
has
got
to
do
with
the
mccarran
act.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--but
i'm
trying
to
understand
if
the
assets
are
not
part
of
the
estate,
then
the
united
states
doesn't
reach
them
under
the
statute,
and
if
you're
right...
that
would
have
been
a
simple
way
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide
the
case,
but
they
didn't,
as
i
understand.
they
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--did
you
make
this
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals?
unknown
speaker
about
knott?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
rishel.
mr.
long,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
mr.
long,
before
you
get
into
anything
else,
does
the
government
agree
with
the
proposition
that
the
bankruptcy
act
doesn't
apply
to--
unknown
speaker
--well,
then
i
really
have
trouble
with
the
rest
of
your
argument
if,
indeed,
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
is
conducting
the
business
of
insurance--
unknown
speaker
--i
cannot
imagine
how
his
paying
out
to
one
or
another
claimant
or
the
order
in
which
he
pays
out
to
a
claimant
isn't
part
of
the
business
of
insurance.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
provision
that
renders
the
bankruptcy
act
inapplicable?
it's
a
provision
of
the
bankruptcy
act
itself?
it's
not
just
simply
mccarran.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
well,
might
not
that
be
considered
an
acknowledgement
in
the
bankruptcy
code
that
the
united
states
considers
a
bankruptcy
trustee
to
be
engaging
in
the
business
of
insurance?
unknown
speaker
priority
statute
gives
the
united
states
priority
over
administrative
expenses
in
the
liquidation?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
just
a
matter
of
grace
i
gather.
unknown
speaker
yes,
all
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
long,
you're
talking
about
the
practice
of
the
united
states.
have
there
been
a
fair
number
of
state
liquidation
proceedings
involving
insurance
companies
in
which
there
has
been
no
contest
about
the
federal
government's
priority?
unknown
speaker
because
there
don't
seem
to
be
many
cases
on--
unknown
speaker
--then
where
do
you
get
the
basis
of
your
statement
about
practice?
