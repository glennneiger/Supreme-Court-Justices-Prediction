mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
more
than
200
years,
congress
has
determined
the
priority
of
federal
claims
against
insolvent
debtors.
the
federal
priority
statute,
section
3713
of
title
31,
provides
that
claims
of
the
united
states
in
nonbankruptcy
proceedings
shall
be
paid
first.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
only
the
plainest
inconsistency
would
warrant
our
finding
an
implied
exception
to
the
operation
of
so
clear
a
command.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
created
an
exception
to
the
clear
command
of
section
3713.
in
our
view,
it
did
not,
and
our
argument
has
three
basic
points.
first,
the
mccarran
act
exemption
applies
to
the
business
of
insurance.
a
state
statute
regulating
the
priority
of
claims
against
the
estate
of
an
insolvent
insurance
company
does
not
regulate
any
business
activity
of
insurance
companies.
consequently,
it
is
not
a
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance
within
the
ordinary
meaning
of
those
words.
second,
the
state
priority
statute
does
not
possess
the
three
characteristics
of
the
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance
identified
in
this
court's
decisions.
it
does
not
result
in
the
transfer
or
spreading
of
risk.
it
is
not
an
integral
part
of
the
contractual
relationship
between
insurer
and
insured,
and
it
involves
entities
wholly
outside
the
insurance
industry.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
let
me
give
a
two-part
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
first
of
all,
i
think
the
test
that
this
court
has
developed
in
cases
since
national
securities
is
a
three-part
test.
it's
considerably
narrower
than
simply
whether
the
state
regulation
has
some
effect
on
the
risk
that
the
policyholder
will
not
be
paid.
we
think
that
test
would
be
too
broad
if
it
were
simply
reduced
back
to
that
single
factor.
the
other
part
of
the
answer
is,
in
fact,
the
priority
statute
has
relatively
little
to
do
with
whether
a
policyholder's
claim
is
paid.
of
course,
it
only
comes
into
play
in
the
event
that
the
insurer
becomes
insolvent,
and
that's
likely
to
be
viewed
as
a
relatively
unlikely
event
by
a
policyholder.
if
it
does
happen,
though,
the
real
insurance
against
insolvency--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--it
may
be
more
likely
these
days,
and
if
it
is
a
real
concern
of
a
policyholder,
the
real
insurance
against
insolvency
is
not
the
priority
statute,
it
is
insurance
guaranty
funds,
which
have
been
established
by
all
50
states
to
pay
claims
of
policyholders
in
the
event
the
insurance
company
becomes
insolvent.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
to
the
extent
that
it
does
and
that
it
meets
the
other
factors
that
this
court
has
identified,
it
could
be,
but
as
i
say,
we
don't
think
that
it
is...
has
a...
is
sufficiently
close
to
the
contractual
relationship.
it
only
applies
in
the
event
of
insolvency.
then
the
guaranty
fund
is
what
steps
in
to
pay
the
claims.
and,
you
know,
if
the
policyholder
were
required
to
rely
on
the
priority
statute,
it
would
not
provide
a
very
good
assurance
because--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
only
if
there
are
enough
assets
in
the
estate
of
the
defunct
insurer
to
pay
policyholder
claims
after
paying--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
cannot.
in
the
event
that
there
is
an
insolvency
and
the
guaranty
fund
does
not
cover
a
claim,
if
the
assets
of
the
insolvent
insurance
company
were
sufficient,
it
is
true
that
a
policyholder
might
recover
a
portion
of
his
claim
i
would
think
in
the
typical
case;
in
an
unusual
case,
the
entire
claim.
but
that
possibility
is
not
enough
to
bring
the
statute
within
the
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
we
think
it
does
not
come
within
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
business
of
insurance
because
it
doesn't
regulate
any
business
activity
of
insurers.
there
are,
of
course,
state
laws
that
are
designed
to
regulate
business.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
but
at
the
point
where
this
statute
comes
into
play,
the
insurance
company
has
been
declared
insolvent.
all
of
its
assets
have
been
taken
over
by
a
liquidator.
its
business
has
been
wound
up,
and
the
question
is
who
gets
the
assets.
there
are
different
categories
of
claimants
lined
up,
and--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
as
i
say,
in
our
view
because
it's
not
a
regulation
of
the
business
activities
of
the
insurers,
it
should
not
be
held
to
be
a
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance,
and
we
don't
think
it
meets
the
three-part
test
that
this
court
has
identified,
which
is
considerably
more
discriminating
than
simply
a
question
of
whether
this
statute
may
lead
to
the
payment
of
a
policyholder's
claim.
and
even
to
the
extent
you
focus
on
that
single
factor,
we
think
that
the
priority
statute
is
really
not
very
good
protection
in
most
cases.
it's
not
something
a
policyholder,
when
he
enters
into
a
policy
of
insurance,
is
likely
to
think
about
as
an
important
protection.
there
may
be
an
analogy
to
if
you
deposit
your
money
in
the
bank,
you
might
think
about
the
federal
deposit
insurance.
that's
equivalent
to
the
guaranty
fund.
it's
unlikely
you
would
think,
well,
the
priority
of
claims
in
the
event
of
insolvency
is
something
that's
also
important.
it's
simply
too
remote
from
the
contract
of
insurance.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think
that's--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
of
course,
this
statute
applies
if
the
state's
regulations
that
are
designed
to
protect
the
solvency
of
insurance
companies
fail
and
the
insurance
company
is
not
solvent,
but
then
the
protection
is
the
guaranty
fund.
that's
what
insures
that
the
claim
is
paid.
let
me
discuss
the
three
factors
that
this
court
has
identified
as
relevant
to
determining
whether
a
statute
regulates
the
business
of
insurance
because
the
test
is
broader
than
simply
whether
the
statute
was
enacted
to
protect
policyholders
or
whether
it
may
affect
the
likelihood
of
a
claim
being
paid.
in
the
variable
annuity
life
insurance
case,
the
court
concluded
that
the
concept
of
insurance
must
involve
some
investment
risk
taking
on
the
part
of
the
company.
in
the
national
securities
case,
the
court
held
that
the
federal
securities
laws
applied
to
a
merger
of
insurance
companies
that
had
been
approved
by
state
insurance
regulators.
it
concluded
that
the
mccarran
act
did
not
make
the
states
supreme
in
regulating
all
the
activities
of
insurance
companies
and
that
state
laws
aimed
at
protecting
the
interests
of
shareholders
are
not
laws
regulating
the
business
of
insurance.
then
in
the
royal
drug
case,
the
court
held
that
agreements
between
an
insurer
and
pharmacies
to
supply
prescription
drugs
to
policyholders
were
not
part
of
the
business
of
insurance.
and
most
recently
in
union
labor
life
insurance
against
pireno,
the
court
held
that
an
insurer's
use
of
a
peer
review
committee
to
determine
whether
policyholder
claims
are
covered
by
the
insurance
contract
is
also
not
the
business
of
insurance.
so,
the
court
has
developed
a
three-factor
test...
and
it's
a
rather
demanding
test...
to
define
the
boundaries
of
the
business
of
insurance.
the
practice
must
have
the
effect
of
transferring
or
spreading
risk
from
the
policyholder
to
the
insurance
company.
it
must
be
an
integral
part
of
the
policy
relationship,
and
it
must
be
limited
to
entities
in
the
insurance
industry.
and
the
ohio
priority
statute
fails
that
demanding
three-part
test.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
in
our
view
it
fails--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--in
our
view
it
fails
all
three
parts
of
the
test.
the
questions
you've
been
asking
go
to
whether
it's
an
integral
part
of
the
relationship
between
the
policyholder
and
the
insurance
company.
we
think
it
fails
that
part
and
clearly
fails
the
other
two
parts
as
well.
i
can
briefly
explain
our
reasoning.
we
think
it
clearly
does
not
involve
any
transfer
of
risk
from
the
policyholder
to
the
insurance
company.
it
just
determines
the
order
in
which
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
think
pireno
is
explicit
on
that,
yes.
it
says
that
the
risk
is
transferred
at
the
time
the
contract
is
entered,
and
whether
or
not
the
claim
is
paid
is
not
what
the
transfer
of
risk
is
all
about.
and
there's
also
no
risk
spreading
because
that
requires
independent
risks.
here
we're
talking
about
the
risk
of
insolvency.
all
the
policyholders
and,
indeed,
all
the
creditors
of
the
insurance
company
face
precisely
the
same
risk.
so,
let
me
turn
to
the
second
factor,
which
is
the
one
that
is
troubling
you,
whether
it's
an
integral
part
of
the
relationship
between
the
insurer
and
the
insured.
now,
again,
in
pireno,
the
court
defined
that
rather
narrowly.
it
noted
first
that
it
was
distinct
from
the
question
whether
the
insurance
contract
is
valid
and
the
amount
of
the
policyholder's
claim
under
the
contract...
and
that's
true
here
as
well.
it's
quite
separate
from
that.
and
the
priority
statute
also
doesn't
address
the
relationship
between
the
insurer
and
the
insured.
it
really
addresses
the
relationship
among
all
the
creditors
of
this
insurance
company
that
has
become
insolvent.
and
of
course,
many
of
those
creditors
are
not
policyholders,
and
some
of
them
come
ahead
of
policyholders.
and
as
we
were
discussing
earlier,
we
don't
believe
that
the
ohio
statute
so
closely
affects
the
reliability
interpretation
and
enforcement
of
the
contract
as
to
satisfy
this
factor.
we
concede
that
it
has
some
effect
on
the
reliability
in
the
sense
that
it
may
in
some
cases
determine
whether
a
part
of
a
policyholder
claim,
in
a
very
unusual
case
the
entire
claim,
is
paid,
but
this
court's
decisions
make
clear
that
some
effect
is
not
enough.
broadly
viewed,
any
state
regulation
of
insurance
could
be
said
to
affect
the
reliability
of
the
insurance
contract.
certainly
in
pireno
the
peer
review
committee,
which
the
very
purpose
of
it
was
to
decide
whether
claims
were
covered
and
should
be
paid.
you
could
argue...
certainly
could
argue
that
that
was
rather
close
to
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes,
we
would
be
making
the
same
argument.
we
think
the
fact
that--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes,
they
would
be
in
an
even
better
position,
but
again
we
don't
think
it
meets
the
three-part
test.
it's
not
a
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance,
and
the--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--we
are
not
suggesting
that
that
factor
is
not
part
of
this
court's
analysis.
we're
suggesting,
though,
it
is
only
a
part
and
that
it
is
not
sufficient
by
itself
to
bring
this
state
statute
within
the
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
as
i
say--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
i
think
a
policyholder
looks
first
to
the
soundness
of
the
insurance
company
and
if
the
insurance
company
fails
to
these
guaranty
funds.
the
priority
statute
is
really
not
something
the
policyholder
is
likely
to
think
about
or
rely
on
and,
indeed,
he
would
be
quite
unwise
to
rely
on
it
because
it
would
rarely
result
in
the
payment
of
his
claims.
and
we
also...
let
me
mention
briefly
the
third
pireno
factor.
we
think
it's
clear
that
this
is
not
limited
to
entities
within
the
insurance
industry.
it
involves
all
types
of
claims,
including
claims
of
suppliers
of
goods
and
services--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
they're
all
claims
against
the
insurance
company,
but
in
royal
drug,
the
contracts
with
the
pharmacies
were
all
claims
involving
insurance
companies--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
it
was
a
factor.
it
was
clearly
a
factor
that
the
court
relied
on
in
both
royal
drug
and
pireno.
the
court
was
not
clear
about
which
factors
were
necessary
to
the
decision
of
its
case,
but
it
was
a
part
of
its
analysis.
it
has
become
an
established
part
of
the
test
for
the
business
of
insurance.
it's...
it
is
one
factor
to
consider.
let
me
mention
a
third
argument
we
have,
which
i
haven't
gotten
to
yet,
which
in
many
ways
i
think
is
our
strongest
argument
in
this
case.
we
think
the
purpose
and
enactment
history
of
the
mccarran
act,
which
is
something
this
court
has
considered
in
its
prior
cases,
strongly
indicate
that
congress
did
not
allow...
intend
to
allow
the
states
to
determine
the
priority
of
claims
against
the
united...
claims
of
the
united
states
against
insolvent
insurance
companies.
the
federal
priority
statute
that's
at
issue
in
this
case
is
one
of
the
oldest
statutes
of
the
united
states.
it
was
enacted
in
1789.
it
was
the
fifth
statute
enacted
by
the
first
congress.
it
has
remained
in
effect
throughout
the
history
of
the
united
states
with
very
little
substantive
change.
it
provides
that
claims
of
the
united
states
in
nonbankruptcy
proceedings
shall
be
paid
first.
and
as
i
said,
the
court
has
held
in
three
case,
moore,
key,
and
emory,
that
only
the
plainest
inconsistency
would
warrant
our
finding
an
implied
exception
to
the
operation
of
so
clear
a
command.
it's
uncontested,
by
the
way,
that
the
federal
priority
statute
applies
to
the
claims
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
would
preempt
the
state
priority
statute
unless
it's
blocked
by
the
mccarran
act.
and
we
don't
believe,
looking
at
the
purpose
in
history
of
the
mccarran
act,
that
this
is
what
congress
had
in
mind.
and
we
look
first...
i
think
the
best
way
to
understand
this
is
chronologically.
if
you
look
first
at
1936,
in
that
year
this
court
decided
a
case,
united
states
against
knott,
knott,
that
involved
the
application
of
the
federal
priority
statute
to
claims
of
the
united
states
against
an
insolvent
insurance
company.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
the
federal
priority
statute
applied,
and
it
preempted
an
inconsistent
state
law,
a
florida
law.
8
years
later--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--that's
absolutely
right.
that
was
the
principal
issue
in
knott,
but
the
first
part
of
the
holding
was
that
the
federal
priority
statute
applied
to
these
claims
as
long
as
they
were
assets
of
the
insolvent
insurance
company.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
that
is...
the
federal
priority
statute
only
applies
to
assets
that
are
assets
of
the
debtor
that
are
in
the
debtor's
estate.
if
the
assets
were
not
in
the
debtor's
estate,
the
federal
priority
statute
would
not
apply.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
well,
that
is
what
congress
has
done.
congress
amended
this
priority
statute
in
1978
when
it
passed
the
bankruptcy
code.
so,
congress
is
very
clear
that
it
has
the
somewhat
lower
priorities
for
federal
claims
in
bankruptcy,
but
it
has
maintained
this
first
priority
in
nonbankruptcy
proceedings.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
have
a
strong
argument
that
i'd
like
to
make
in
a
second,
but
i
don't
think
it's
necessarily
a
senseless
distinction
if
you
recognize
that
congress
is
not
writing
these
priorities.
there's
actually
a
difficult
problem
of
draftsmanship
that
occurs
when
you
may
have
two
competing
priority
systems.
but
congress
may
have
felt
that
if
it's
not
writing
the
priorities
and
federal
judges
are
not
applying
them,
that
it's
going
to
stick
with
the
old
first
priority
from
1798,
and
we
don't
think
that's
unreasonable.
but
let
me
get
back
to
our...
very
quickly
go
through
our
argument
about
purpose
and
enactment
history.
8
years
after
knott
in
1944,
the
court
decided
the
south-eastern
underwriters
case.
it
held
that
the
business
of
insurance
is
interstate
commerce.
that
was
what
precipitated
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
1
year
later
in
1945.
and
this
court
has
recognized
time
and
time
again
that
mccarran
was
a
response
to
south-eastern
underwriters.
it
was
basically
intended
to
turn
back
the
clock
to
the
days
prior
to
that
decision
by
giving
back
to
the
states
their
traditional
authority
to
tax
and
regulate
the
business
of
insurance.
congress
made
clear
that
it
did
not
intend
to
confer
any
additional
regulatory
authority
on
the
states
that
they
did
not
possess
prior
to
south-eastern
underwriters.
and,
of
course,
this
court
had
held
in
knott,
prior
to
south-eastern
underwriters,
that
the
states
had
no
authority
to
overrule
the
federal
priority
statute
in
insurance
company
insolvency
proceedings.
and
it's
not
surprising
that
the
court
reached
that
result
in
knott
and
reached
it
unanimously
because
prior
to
south-eastern
underwriters
and
prior
to
the
mccarran
act,
even
under
the
narrow
view
of
the
commerce
clause
that
prevailed
as
to
insurance
companies
at
that
time,
it
was
clear
that
congress
had
the
power
to
enact
a
federal
priority
statute
under
the
bankruptcy
clause,
under
a
separate
head
of
power
under
the
constitution.
so,
we
think
it
would
be
extraordinary
to
conclude
that
in
enacting
the
mccarran
act,
congress
intended
to
expand
the
regulatory
authority
of
the
states
beyond
the
authority
that
they
had
traditionally
exercised
and
to
leave
the
determination
of
the
priority
of
claims
of
the
united
states
entirely
to
the
states,
which
predictably
would
result
in
the
kind
of
priority
statute
that
we
have
here
where
the
claims
of
the
united
states
are
not
only
subordinated
to
claims
of
policyholders,
but
also
to
claims
of
general
creditors,
which
of
course
can't
possibly
be
justified
on
the
basis
of
protecting
policyholders.
so,
to
summarize
our
argument,
we
think
the
ohio
priority
statute
falls
outside
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
business
of
insurance
because
it
does
not
regulate
any
business
activity
of
insurers.
we
think
it
does
not
satisfy
this
court's
three-part
test
for
defining
the
business
of
insurance,
which
is
a
narrow
and
demanding
test,
and
finally,
it
was
clearly
not
part
of
the
states'
traditional
authority,
prior
to
south-eastern
underwriters
and
the
mccarran
act,
to
regulate
the
priority
of
claims
of
the
united
states.
and
the
mccarran
act
was
passed
to
restore,
but
not
expand
the
states'
authority.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
thank
you--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes,
that's
correct.
congress
has--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
congress
has--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--well,
congress
has
expressly
provided
that
insurance
company
insolvencies
shall
not
be
handled
through
the
federal
bankruptcy
process,
but
in
passing
the
federal
bankruptcy
code,
they
also
amended
this
federal
priority
statute
that
we
have
here
before
us
today.
the
amendment
said
that
the
federal
priority
statute
shall
not
apply
in
proceedings
under
the
federal
bankruptcy
code
because
of
the
different
priorities
congress
established.
but
congress
left
in
effect
the
federal
priority
statute,
the
first
priority
as
to
nonbankruptcy
proceedings,
and
there
was
no
indication
that
it
intended
to
change
the
rule
that
the
federal
priority
statute
applies
in
insurance
company
insolvency
proceedings,
just
as
it
applies
in
other
types
of
state
receiverships
and
in
proceedings
against
insolvent
estates
of
decedents.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
i'm
sorry.
i
believe
it's
cited
in
our
brief,
and
i'm
sorry
i
do
not...
cannot
remember
it.
but
it
is
expressly
provided
in
the
bankruptcy
code
that
it
shall
not
apply
to
bankruptcies
of
insurance
companies
and
financial
institutions.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
no.
we
think
the
opposite,
and
that's
really
our
basic
position
in
this
case,
is
that
congress
has
always
been
very
precise
about
priorities
of
claims
of
the
united
states.
it
has
always
decided
that
for
itself.
when
it
wanted
the
united
states
to
have
any
position
other
than
first,
it
said
so,
and
it
has
done
that
in
the
federal
bankruptcy
act.
it
has
excluded
insurance
company
insolvencies
from
the
bankruptcy
code,
but
it
has
left
in
effect...
and
it's
amended
in
'78
and
again
in
1982,
this
federal
priority
statute,
which
this
court
has
held
many
times
is
very
broad,
is
very
clear,
and
this
court
will
not
imply
an
exception
to
its
clear
command
unless
congress
has
very
clearly
indicated
that
there
must
be
one.
and
the
history
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
plainly
indicates
that
this
was
not
what
congress
had
in
mind.
let
me
say
just
a
word
about
knott.
i
think
the
distinction
suggested
this
morning,
which
is
a
new
suggestion,
was
not
argued
below,
doesn't
work
anyway.
the
federal
priority
statute
has
been
applied
many
times
over
the
years
when
a
receiver
has
been
appointed
or
a
liquidator
to
take
over
the
assets
of
an
insolvent
debtor.
that's
one
of
the
classic
acts
of
bankruptcy.
that's
one
of
the
main
situations
in
which
the
statute
is
triggered,
and
it's...
the
court
has
never
held
that
that
works...
it
moves
the
assets
away
from
the
debtor.
it's
the
debtor's
estate
at
that
point.
the
assets
are
still
there.
they're
just
in
the
debtor's
estate.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
yes,
that
is...
it
is
a
first
priority.
in...
the
practice
of
the
government
has
always
been
to
allow,
you
know,
reasonable
administrative
expenses
to
be
paid,
and
i
should
add
that
we
also
have
a
practice--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
and
we
also
have
a
practice
of
granting
a
release
once
claims
of
the
united
states
have
been
settled
so
that
there's
not
uncertainty
about
whether
the
united
states
will
come
forward
with
additional
claims.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i--
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
--i
tried
to
find
that
out
from
the
federal
government.
mr.
robert
a.
long,
jr.
i
think
there
were
not
a
great
number
of
insolvencies,
and
the
united
states
often
didn't
file
claims
in
the
past.
and
also,
this
practice
of
the
states
of
prioritizing
claims
and
placing
the
united
states
rather
low
seems
to
have
begun
only
in
the
late
'60's
in
wisconsin.
it's
a
fairly
recent
development.
we
don't
have
claims
in
every
insurance
company
insolvency
proceeding
because
we
often
don't
have
any
bonds
with
the
company
and
may
not
have
any
tax
claims.
the
basic
argument
here
today
by
respondent
is
that
any
state
law
aimed
at
protecting
policyholders
is
a
regulation
of
the
business
of
insurance
within
the
meaning
of
mccarran-ferguson.
we
think
that
is
too
broad
a
definition.
we
think
that
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
prior
decisions,
and
in
particular,
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
antitrust...
the
application
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
the
business
of
insurance,
which
is
also
at
issue
here
and
is
also
an
interest
of
the
federal
government.
so,
we
urge
the
court
not
to
reject
its
prior
decisions
and
adopt
that
much
broader
test.
i
mean,
it
really
is
true
that
in
a
general
sense
every
state
law
regulating
insurance
companies
is
aimed
at
protecting
policyholders.
and
finally,
very
briefly,
on
the
third
factor,
there
was
a
argument
that
something
that's
not
unique
to
the
insurance
industry
shouldn't
be
covered
by
this
factor.
in
fact,
the
purpose
of
that
factor,
this
court
has
said,
is
to
recognize
the
importance
of
intra-industry
competition.
congress
thought
that
was
particularly
important
in
the
insurance
business
that
insurance
companies
needed
to
cooperate
on
rates
and
statistical
information
and
so
forth.
so,
we
think
that
is
actually
a
relevant
consideration,
although
again
our
principal
submission
under
that
factor
is
that
a
lot
of
these
claims
involve
the
ordinary
business
relationships
of
an
insurance
company
with
suppliers
of
goods
and
services
like
the
relationship
in
royal
drug
with
pharmacies
that
this
court
said
was
not
a
part
of
the
business
of
insurance.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
