mr.
james
r.
rishel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there's
one
point
that
i
want
to
make
clear
at
the
outset
before
going
to
the
core
legal
question
in
this
case,
and
that
is
even
after
an
insurance
company
is
found
to
be
insolvent,
it
still
functions
as
an
insurance
company
with
respect
to
the
claims
of
its
policyholders
that
arose
before
a
finding
of
insolvency.
the
company's
contractual
relationship
with
these
policyholders
is
unchanged.
the
risk
the
company
assumed
upon
contracting
with
these
policyholders
remains
and
is
still
being
developed,
and
the
company's
obligation
to
pay
these
claims
of
these
policyholders
is
unsatisfied,
unrelieved.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
largely
that's
true.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
absolutely.
absolutely,
and
we
do.
in
insurance
insolvency,
a
winding
up
is
not
governed
by
the
federal
bankruptcy
laws.
it's
governed
by
an
entire
chapter
of
our
revised
code
that
provides
for
the...
all
the
provisions
with
respect
to
the
authority
of
the
superintendent
of
insurance
when
he
winds
up
an
insolvent
company.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
no,
they
do
not,
your
honor.
in
fact,
we've
cited
cases
in
our
brief
where
officers,
directors,
or
owners
of
insurance
companies
have
tried
to
take
insurance
companies
into
federal
bankruptcy...
in
bankruptcy
court
arguing
that
once
there
was
a
finding
of
insolvency,
they
were
no
longer
an
insurance
company.
they
were
something
else.
and
the
federal
courts
have
held
that
the
insolvency
of
the
company
does
not
change
the
entity.
it
is
still
an
insurance
company,
and
it
cannot
be
a
debtor
in
federal
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
the
point
i
made
as
respect...
it's
unchanged
as
to
those.
now,
as
to
the
core
legal
test
here
from
the
court's
case
in
pireno,
we
believe
that
test
applies,
and
we
believe
the
statute
meets
that
test.
i
don't--
mr.
james
r.
rishel
--well,
justice
white,
there
is
typically
in
these
insolvencies
the
provision
of
state
law
that
terminates
those...
the...
terminates--
mr.
james
r.
rishel
--the
policies
usually
30
or
60
days
after
a
finding
of
insolvency.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
a
notice
goes
out.
the
policyholders
are
afforded
an
opportunity
to
get
new
coverage,
and
the
coverage
is
cut
off--
mr.
james
r.
rishel
--so
as
to
minimize
the
claims
and
maximize
the
assets
that
can
be
distributed.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
if
he
has
a
claim
that--
mr.
james
r.
rishel
--well,
he
can
get
a
return
of
the
premiums.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
okay?
mr.
james
r.
rishel
if
there's
any
money,
yes.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
it
would
be
the
same
class
as
if
there
were...
it
would
be
classified
the
same
as
if
the
policyholder
had
a
claim.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
james
r.
rishel
--i
think
it
gets
to
a
question
that's
really
not
the
legal
question
here,
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
question
isn't
how
has
ohio
chosen
to
regulate
the
business
of
insurance.
the
question
is
whether
we
have
chosen
to
regulate
the
business
of
insurance.
i
don't
think
that
question
would
be
changed
if
the
order
in
our
statute
were
the
state
of
ohio
gets
its
claims
paid
first,
the
federal
government's
claims
are
paid
next,
and
then
the
policyholders'
claims
are
paid.
from
a
practical
standpoint,
we
might
not
be
here,
but
the
legal
question
is
the
same.
it's
not
how
ohio
has
regulated
the
payment
of
claims
in
the
event
of
insolvency.
it's
that
we
have
done
that.
we
have
regulated.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
no.
i
don't
think
you
need
to
look
at
each
provision.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
it
as
a
whole
and
ask
does
it
do
something
to
regulate
the
relationship
between
the
insolvent
company
and
its
policyholders
to
effectuate
the
payment
of
claims.
and
it
does
that.
and
as
i
said,
the
question
isn't
how
have
we
regulated.
the
question
is
have
we
regulated
the
business
of
insurance
as
defined
by
the
court
in
pireno.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
in
actuality
and
practice
it
is,
your
honor,
but
it
need
not
be
to
satisfy
this
court's
test
in
pireno.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
well,
in
terms
of
the
administrative
claims
that
are
ahead
of
it--
mr.
james
r.
rishel
--that's
normal.
and
also,
the
minute
second
class
of
claims,
employee
wages
up
to
$1,000,
that's
fairly
typical
also
in
other
claims
priorities,
and
they
really
don't
dilute
that.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
well,
it
would
to
a
certain
extent.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
in
this
case,
the
assets
of
this
company
have
grown
from
the
time
of
insolvency
from
about
$26
million
up
to
over
$68
million,
and
that's
after
all
the
administrative
expenses
have
been
paid.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
and
the
state
of
ohio
put
them
in
front
of
their
own
claims
also.
as
to
pireno,
i
would
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
this
morning
that...
his
argument
is
to
the
effect
i
believe
that
you
can't
just
have
a
mechanical
application
of
this
test.
as
he
says
in
his
brief,
you
have
to
appreciate
the
pedigree
of
pireno,
and
i
would
also
say
that's
the
essence
of
pireno.
and
that
comes
from
national
securities.
and
the
real
essence
of
this
whole
question
is
whether
or
not
the
state
law
is
aimed
at
protecting
regulating
the
relationship
between
the
company
and
its
policyholders
either
directly
and
indirectly.
if
so,
those
laws
are
the
business
of
insurance.
with
respect
to
the
three
tests
of
pireno,
if
i
could
start
with
the
third
test,
the
statute
only
applies
to
insurance
companies.
it's
limited
to
an
entity
that's
in
the
insurance
business,
and
that's
the
insolvent
company.
and
all
the
claims
against
the
insurance
company
are
claims
against
the
insurance
company.
i
think
pireno
is
easily
satisfied.
now,
as
to
this
third
test,
the
government
interjects
a
requirement
that
i
don't
think
is
in
this
court's
opinions
or
is
logical.
and
they
state
in
their
brief
that
the
regulation
has
to
be
peculiar
or
unique
to
the
business
of
insurance.
i
don't
read
that
anyplace
in
the
court's
cases,
nor
does
it
make
any
sense
because
licensing
is
not
a
unique
form
of
state
regulation
of
insurance,
but
licensing
or
state
laws
which
regulate
the
licensing
of
an
insurance
company
clearly
regulate
the
business
of
insurance.
as
to
the
second
test
of
pireno,
the
ohio
statute
reinforces
the
contractual
relationship
between
the
insurer
and
insured,
and--
mr.
james
r.
rishel
--no,
absolutely
it
would
not.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
don't
think
that's
the
point.
maybe
i
wasn't
clear.
they
said
it
had
to
be
peculiar.
this
type
of
regulation
had
to
be
peculiar,
and
since
priority
statutes
weren't
peculiar
to
insurance,
they
couldn't
satisfy
the
third
prong
of
the
pireno
test,
and
that
was
my
point.
i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
peculiar.
i
think
it
has
to
regulate
the
business
of
insurance.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
i
don't
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
it
applies
only
to
insurance
company
insolvencies,
your
honor.
it
does
not
apply
as
a
general
proposition
to
anything
but
insurance
companies.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
absolutely.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
absolutely.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
well,
they
would...
as
to
the
general
creditors,
i
mean,
all
the
debts
that
are
before,
except
for
general
creditors,
relate
to
the
actual
business
of
insurance,
the
policyholders.
i
mean,
that's
what
this
statute
regulates.
that's
why
it
prefers
those
claims.
now,
as
to
the
second
criteria,
as
i
said,
we
believe
it's
integral
with
the
whole
policy
relationship.
it
undergirds
that
relationship
at
a
time
when
the
policyholder
is
truly
in
a
situation
where
they
may
not
get
paid,
and
it
also
satisfies
the
first
prong
of
the
pireno
test
because
it
effectuates
on
a
continuing
basis
the
actual
spreading
of
risk
among
policyholders.
the
arguments
by
the
government
as
to
the
guaranty
fund,
our
response
to
that
is,
yes,
guaranty
funds
exist.
yes,
they
pay
some
policyholder
claims,
but
that
doesn't
matter.
the
best
evidence
of
the
fact
that
guaranty
funds
are
not
the
panacea
that
might
be
suggested
is
the
fact
that
the
federal
government's
claim
for
$10.7
million
is
still
unpaid.
it's
not
covered
by
any
guaranty
fund.
like
many
claims
against
the
insurance
company
here,
they're
not
covered
by
the
guaranty
funds
because
they
arose
out
of
bonds.
guaranty
funds...
and
i'll
use
ohio's
as
an
indication.
the
ohio
guaranty
fund
has
a
definition
of
what's
a
covered
claim,
and
then
it
has
18
enumerated
exceptions
from
that
coverage.
it
also
has
a
monetary
limit.
so,
as
to
those
policyholders
whose
claims
are
not
covered
by
guaranty
funds
or
are
not
covered
in
whole
by
guaranty
funds,
the
only
chance
they
have
to
receive
the
protection
they
purchased
is
through
the
insolvency
procedures
in
the
state
of
ohio.
as
to
the
knott
decision,
i
thought
that
the
solicitor
general
did
an
excellent
job
of
distinguishing
that
case
from
this
case
in
his
reply
brief.
on
page
14,
his
footnote
number
9,
i
believe,
the
last
sentence
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
says
federal...
knott,
and
he
gives
the
citation.
federal
priority
statute
inapplicable
if
state
statute
divests
insurance
company
of
title
to
assets.
i
think
that's
a
very
succinct
holding
of
this
court's
decision
in
knott.
and
then
i'd
ask
you
to
look
at
appendix
page
a
in
our
brief,
section
3903.18
of
the
ohio
revised
code,
another
section
of
our
insurance
liquidation
act,
which
says
the
liquidator
shall
be
vested
by
operation
of
law
with
the
title
to
all
of
the
property,
contracts,
and
rights
of
action
and
all
of
the
books
and
records
of
the
insurer
ordered
liquidated,
wherever
located,
as
of
the
entry
of
the
final
order
of
liquidation.
so,
what
didn't
happen
in
knott
happened
here,
and
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
title
to
the
assets
passed
to
the
superintendent
of
insurance,
and
knott
is
just
plainly
not
applicable
to
this
case.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
it
passed
at
the
moment
of
insolvency.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
at...
yes,
that's
one
of
the
criteria.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
well,
i
think...
well,
i
don't
think
we
have
a
tie,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
this
act
applies.
the
history
given
by
counsel
is
interesting,
but
i
think
the
most
interesting
piece
of
the
whole
enactment
history
was
senator
ferguson's
answer
to
a
question
of
whether
or
not
this
law
applied
to
all
federal
laws
at
the
time,
and
his
answer
was
a
simple
yes,
that's
the
intent
of
it.
and
the
statute
says
no
act
of
congress,
and
then
it
enumerates
certain
exceptions.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
james
r.
rishel
--well,
i
do,
if
i
can
get
back
to
that.
in
the
knott
case,
the
federal
government
went
after
certain
monies
that
had
been
on
deposit
in
florida.
they
were
placed
there
by
a
new
jersey
company
that
became
insolvent
and
went
into
rehabilitation
in
new
jersey,
and
the
federal
government
went
after
those
special
deposits
in
florida.
it
didn't
come
after
the
assets
in
the
hands
of
the
rehabilitator.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
no,
it
was.
i
mean,
they
were...
in
that
case,
they
were
granted
priority
to
those
assets
in
florida.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
the
united
states
was,
yes.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
now,
so,
they
didn't
go
after
those
assets
here.
they
went
after
the
assets,
the
title
to
which
have
transferred
to
the
superintendent
of
insurance.
so,
knott
is
distinguishable,
and
indeed,
the
law
in
knott
i
think
supports
our
position
better
than
theirs.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
the
property
is
part
of
the
estate.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
title
to
the
property
remains
in
the
company.
in
knott,
the
title
to
those
assets
in
florida
remained
in
the
company.
it
didn't
become
assets
of
the
estate.
the
assets
the
government
seeks
here
are
the
assets
of
the
liquidation
estate,
the
title
to
which
passed
to
the
superintendent
of
insurance.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
i
think
we
have
the
better
position
on
knott,
and
i
think
if
you
apply
the
test
from
pireno,
we
win,
yes.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
right.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
no,
they
did
not.
they
applied
the
tests
from
pireno
after
examining
the
other
cases.
mr.
james
r.
rishel
we
made
basically
the
same
arguments--
mr.
james
r.
rishel
--we
made...
we
tried
to
distinguish
knott.
what
i
didn't
have
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
what
i
have
here,
and
that's
the
solicitor
general's
distinction
of
the
case,
which
i
think
is
terrific.
in
conclusion,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
found
that
the
ohio
statute
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
large,
complex,
specialized
administrative
system
adopted
by
the
state
of
ohio
to
regulate
the
life
of
a
domestic
insurance
company
from
inception
to
dissolution
pursuant
to
the
authority
granted
the
state
by
mccarran-ferguson.
the
government
would
transform
that
complex,
specialized
administrative
system
into
a
claims
collection
process
for
the
primary
benefit
of
the
federal
government.
to
allow
the
federal
government
to
assert
a
priority
under
the
federal
claims
priority
act
would
allow
for
the
very
federal
statutory
interference
with
state
regulation
which
congress
eliminated
in
mccarran-ferguson.
under
a
correct
application
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
and
the
phrase
business
of
insurance,
as
defined
by
this
court,
we
believe
that
the
federal
government's
claim
against
the
american
druggists'
insurance
company
is
to
be
determined
by
the
ohio
statute
and
not
by
the
federal
claims
priority
act.
we
would
respectfully
request
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
