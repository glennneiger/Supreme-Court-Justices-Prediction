justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
general
starr,
do
you
think
the
senate
or
the
house
could
have
impeached
a
judge
and
merely
recited
the
fact
that
he
had
been
convicted
of
a
crime
and
that
was
the
ground
of
impeachment
and
then
the
evidence
of
that
be
sufficient
before
the
senate
to
remove
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
think
all
of
this
was
process
and
may
not
have
even
been
necessary.
