well,
would
it
be
reviewable,
in
your
view,
if
a
quorum
was
not
present
at
all
times,
and
could
a
senator
vote
ultimately
who
had
not
heard
all
of
the
evidence,
in
your
view?
i
mean,
what
are
you
getting...
asking
the
court
to
get
into?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
this
court,
if
we
exercise
original
jurisdiction
and
appoint
a
master,
and
we
don't
all
sit
there
and
hear
the
evidence.
have
we
conducted
a
trial
that
fails
to
meet
the
constitution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
well,
i
think
they
could
involve
a
great
many
rights...
water
rights,
or
one
thing
and
another...
that
are
terribly
important.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
if
the
record
shows
that
there
was
not
a
vote
of
two-thirds
of
the
senate
to
convict?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
in
your
view
that
might
be
justiciable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
claim
before
us
today...
should
we
treat
it
as
nonjusticiable,
or
just
committed
by
the
text
to
the
discretion
of
the
senate?
