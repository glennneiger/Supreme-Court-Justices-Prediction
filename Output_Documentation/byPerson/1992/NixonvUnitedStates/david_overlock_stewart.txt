mr.
david
overlock
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
challenge
in
this
case
senate
impeachment
rule
xi,
under
which
the
senate
failed
to
conduct
the
impeachment
trial
of
walter
nixon
when
it
removed
him
as
chief
judge
of
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
mississippi.
the
constitutional
requirement
of
a
senate
impeachment
trial
means
that
the
accused
must
have
the
opportunity
to
present
his
case,
to
present
witnesses
and
to
confront
witnesses
against
him
before
the
duly
convened
senate,
which
requires
the
presence
of
a
quorum
of
the
senators.
under
impeachment
rule
xi,
however,
the
trial
occurred
in
this
case
only
before
a
committee
of
12
senators
which
required
a
quorum
of
only
7.
the
impeachment
trial
requirement
is
important,
because
it
ensures
to
the
greatest
extent
possible--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--well,
your
honor,
we
do
think
that
the
proceeding
that
anyone
comfortable
with
judicial
proceedings
would
identify
as
the
trial
did
in
fact
occur
before
the
committee,
and
indeed,
if
you
look
at
rule
11--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--it
is
indeed.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
the
impeachment
trial
clause
ensures
that
the
senate
will
approach
the
cases
and
exercise
its
ultimate
power
to
remove
executive
and
judicial
officers
with
great
care
and
deliberation.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
well,
your
honor,
that
certainly
has
been
the
position
of
respondents,
that
that
is
the
only...
that
word
sole
is
the
only
relevant
word
in
the
passage,
and
that
word
cuts
off
all
review
by
the
courts,
but
i
think
that
that
reading
of
that
word
hangs
such
a
tremendous
amount
on
that
word
that
it's
really
not
defensible.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
i'm
not
trying
to
be
partial
here,
your
honor,
i
am
simply
trying
to
demonstrate...
to
describe
it...
it
does
seem
to
describe
an
impeachment
trial.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
fair
enough.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
but
there
are
several
elements
that
the
trial
and
other
elements
of
the
constitution
require
a
limited...
that
limit
the
power
of
the
senate
in
conducting
these
impeachments.
the
framers
insisted
that
removal,
the
exercise
of
this
ultimate
power,
can
only
be
when
there's
proof
of
an
offense...
a
high
crime
or
misdemeanor,
treason,
or
bribery...
and
a
conviction
must
be
based,
in
the
words
of
the
federalist
papers,
on
a
real
demonstration
of
innocence
or
guilt.
another
element
by
which
they
tried
to
control
the
impeachment
and
removal
power
was
by
providing
a
two-thirds
majority
had
to
be
present,
and
another
element
we
think
is
very
important
here
and
brings
us
here
today
is
that
the
senate
must
conduct
the
impeachment
trial
acting
in
judicial
character
as
a
court.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
could
be
reviewable,
and
that
the
court
has
to
face
up
to
that.
it's
not
presented
here,
of
course,
but
yes,
we
do
think
that
would
be
reviewable
here,
and
maybe
it
would
be
useful
for
me
to
address
directly
the
question
of
sole
power
and
the
question
of
reviewability,
which
we
think
really
the
respondents
have
hung
so
much
on.
an
ordinary
reading
of
the
clause...
the
senate
shall
have
the
sole
power
to
try
impeachments...
sole
would
simply
describe
the
fact
that
the
senate
has
the
power
to
try
the
case,
and
no
other
forum
has
the
power
to
try
the
case,
and
that--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--well,
of
course,
that's
the
way
the
clause
was
written
as
it
was
initially
approved,
and
it
was
only
in
the
committee
of
style
that
the
word
sole
was
adopted.
it
means
that
the
senate
has
the
power
to
determine
trial
procedures.
admission
of
evidence,
there
are
lots
of
elements
of
a
senate
trial
that
do
not
resemble
a
court
trial.
for
example,
there's
no
standard
of
proof.
the
senate
has
refused
to
have
a
standard
of
proof,
and
we
don't
think
that
would
be
reviewable,
but
what
does
remain
reviewable
is
whether
there
was
a
trial
at
all.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
those
are
two
different
questions,
i
think,
and
let
me
try
to
answer
them
separately.
the
question
whether
a
senator
could
vote
without
having
heard
all
the
evidence,
my
answer
to
that
is
yes.
all
that's
required
is
that
there
be
a
quorum
present,
and
that
by
definition
means
you
could
have
as
many
as
49
senators
not
present
and
those
senators
might
well
vote.
many
senators
in
the
past
have
asked
to
be
excused
from
voting
if
they
didn't
hear
the
evidence,
but
there's
no
constitutional
issue
presented.
your
initial
question,
though,
was
is
there
a
problem
if
there
as
not
a
quorum
present,
and
my
answer
to
that,
i
think,
has
to
be
yes,
that
that
would
be
the
senate
was
not
duly
constituted.
if
it
is
in
the
record
that
the
senate
was
not
duly
constituted
and
the
senate
recklessly
went
ahead
with
the
trial
anyway
over
the
objection
of
the
accused,
that
would
in
fact
be
reviewable.
there
you
would
have
no
trial
actually
being
held
before
the
senate.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
it
is
a
senate
trial
as
provided
in
the
constitution,
yes.
a
senate
trial
is--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--if
you
look
at--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--i
have
no
problem
with
the
proposition
that
the
framers
intended
all
senators
to
be
present,
but
what
they
provided
in
the
text
of
the
constitution
is
that
the
senate
can
conduct
its
business
with
a
quorum
present.
if
the
senate
is
then
in
that
impeachment
trial
clause
to
try
the
case,
then
it
need
only
have
a
quorum
present.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
surely
undesirable
from
a
point
of
citizenship--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--but
yes.
yes.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
those
proceedings
do
not
resemble
an
impeachment
proceeding
to
the
extent
that
they
involve
stripping
an
individual
of
rights.
in
that
kind
of
case
there
is
a
statutory
provision--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--but
there
is
no
provision
in
the
constitution
that
provides
that
the
trial
must
be
before
this
court
in
those
cases.
the
only
provision
that
would
be
applicable,
i
think,
would
be
the
seventh
amendment
which
might
well,
when
you
had
an
individual
present,
provide
a
right
to
a
jury,
and
indeed
there
is
a
statute
that
provides
for
a
jury
trial
right
in
those
circumstances
in
this
court.
of
course,
it
hasn't
been
used
for
many
years,
but
there
is
that
right.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i
completely
understand
the
question.
if
the--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--your
honor,
i
think
that
would
not--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--to
answer
the
first
question,
you
can't
cross-examine
the
witnesses,
we
state
that
the
irreducible
requirement
of
the
trial
is
the
opportunity
to
present
your
case,
present
your
witnesses,
and
confront
the
witnesses
against
you,
so
there
would
be
a
right
of
cross-examination,
and
you
could
pose
that
hypothetical
where
there
is
no
right
of
cross-examination,
and
i
would
say
that
is
not
a
trial,
but
if
the
issue
were
one
of
the
scope
of
cross-examination,
that
would
be
one
confined
to
the
discretion
of
the
senate.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
there
has
to
be
a
specific
requirement
in
the
constitution,
and
i
draw
this
from
baker
and
carr
and
also
from
powell
v.
mccormack.
if
there
is
a
specific
requirement
like
the
two-thirds
majority
vote,
like
the
requirement
that
the
house
impeach
officers
before
they
face
trial
in
the
senate,
if
there
is
that
specific
requirement,
then
that
is
a
justiciable
question,
and
that's
one
that
the
courts
have
to
decide.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
no,
sir,
and
in
those
instances
as
i
recall
the
case
was
extended
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
and
there
certainly
was
an
opportunity
to
prepare,
but
no,
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
reviewable.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
no,
i
would
not,
an
interestingly,
i
think
the
framers
imposing
the
trial
clause
were
very
wise
to
impose
the
trial
clause,
because
when
you're
dealing
with
the
chief
justice
or
a
justice
of
the
supreme
court
or
the
president,
there
is
a
political
attention
to
this
which
i
think
will
slow
down
the
process
in
most
instances.
you
point
out
instances
where
it
didn't,
but
in
fact
there
were
partisans
for
those
individuals
who
attempted
to
support
them
and
defend
their
rights.
when
you're
dealing
with
a
lower
court
judge
you
don't
have
those
protections.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
i
don't
mean
to
say
that,
your
honor,
no.
what
i
mean
to
say
is,
it
simply
highlights
the
importance
of
the
trial
when
you're
dealing
with
a
lower
court
judge.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
i
think
to
rule
in
our
favor
the
court
has
to
conclude
that
the
word
try
does
have
meaning
and
the
meaning
is
as
we
say
that
there
is
an
irreducible
requirement
of
an
opportunity
to
present
your
case
and
confront
your
case,
and
that
meaning
i
don't
think
is
so
elusive
when
you
compare
the
impeachment
clause
to
other
clauses
of
the
constitution
creating
powers
for
the
senate...
for
example,
the
power
to
be
the
judge
of
elections.
that
doesn't
have
any
element
of
confronting
witnesses
or
presenting
witnesses.
that's
simply
a
requirement
of
a
decision.
in
this
instance,
though,
try
means
something
else,
and
i
think
respondent's
position,
in
order
to
rule
for
them
you
really
have
to
say
that
try
is
the
same
as
be
the
judge
as,
and
when
you
look
at
the
history,
when
the
first
senate,
which
included
framers,
had
to
apply
both
of
these
provisions
when
they
were
applying
the
elections
clause
they
had
evidentiary
proceedings
before
committees,
but
when
they
were
applying
the
impeachment
clause,
when
they
were
conducting
impeachment
trials
they
did
those
before
the
senate.
that
was
the
common
sense
understanding
of
the
time,
and
i
think
that
case
casts
an
important
light
on
the
question
before
the
court
here.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
i
think
we
would
lose.
i'm
not
exactly
comfortable
as
to
whether
that
is
a
nonjusticiable
question
or
simply
we
would
lose
on
the
merits.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
yes,
it
is,
and
i'd
be
happy
to
address
it,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
justiciability,
as
i
was
saying
earlier,
hangs
so
much
on
the
word
sole.
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
word
sole
is
that
it
means
simply
that
the
senate
has
the
power
to
try
the
case
and
no
other
forum
does.
it's
not
that
the
word
excludes
judicial
review.
if
the
framers
intended
to
exclude
judicial
review
of
impeachments,
why
not
do
so?
why
not
say
that
the
judicial
power
shall
extend
to
all
cases
arising
under
the
constitution
except
impeachments?
that's
what
they
did
in
the
pardon
clause.
the
pardon
clause
says
that
the
presidential
power
to
pardon
shall
extend
to
all
cases
except
cases
of
impeachment.
well,
the
framers
didn't
do
that,
and
that
seems
very
persuasive
to
us
in
two
respects.
first,
they
clearly
did
not
choose
to
exclude
judicial
review,
therefore
the
ordinary
presumption
of
judicial
review,
the
power
of
this
court
to
say
what
the
law
is,
applies,
but
by
the
same
token
when
they
didn't
accept
this
notion
that
impeachment
trial
is
this
island,
unreachable
by
any
other
entity,
that
they
recognized
unless
they
excluded
the
president
from
exercising
pardon
power,
well
then,
he
would
have
the
power
to
exercise...
to
pardon
individuals
who
had
been
impeached
and
convicted.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
absolutely.
i
think
any
individual
can
waive
a
constitutional
right,
and
i
think
in
fact--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--if
i
were
a
senator
and
i
objected
to
that
because
i
wanted
to
hear
the
testimony,
then
i
would
have
the
right
to
go
listen
to
the
testimony.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
you
would
have
the...
you
could
do
so,
but
no,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
proceeding
in
an
unconstitutional
manner,
because
the
right
inheres
in
the
individual,
and
if
the
individual
chooses
to
waive
that
right,
he
certainly
has
the
power
to
do
so.
and
indeed,
when
the
impeachment
rule
xi
was
adopted
in
1935,
the
history
of
it
clearly
indicates
that
the
senate...
many
of
the
senators,
at
least,
thought
that
this
was
a
right
only...
that
could
only
be
waived,
and
that
it
could
not
be
forced
to
have
an
impeachment
accused
go
to
trial
before
a
committee
and
not
before
the
full
senate.
in
the
intervening
50
years
before
the
next
impeachment,
apparently
that
understanding
was
lost.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
no
trial
before
the
senate.
that
is
our
view.
and
indeed,
when
you
look
at
what
respondents
are
saying
when
they
have
to
present
their
position
on
the
merits
of
this
claim,
they
propose
an
extraordinarily
artificial
concept,
that
well,
the
trial
happened
before
the
senate
even
though
all
of
the
testimony
and
all
of
the
proceedings
were
before
the
committee,
and
that
just
violates
basic
concepts
of
common
sense,
and
its
untenable.
and
even
if
you
look
at
the
text
of
rule
xi,
rule
xi
speaks
in
terms
of
either
the
senate
conducting
the
trial,
the
committee
conducting
the
trial,
or
the
senate
shall
conduct
the
entire
trial
itself.
that's
the
last
words
of
the
rule.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
i...
i
think
that's
certainly
a
tenable
view,
but
it
is
not
the
use
of
the
word
try.
it
does
not
say
that
the
supreme
court--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--i
think
it
may
well
have
been
an
intent,
but
it
is
not
expressed,
and
moreover
there
is
no
right
to
assert
except
in
the
case
of
an
individual,
that
the
states
cannot
assert
a
seventh
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
i
would
have
to
review
the
seventh
amendment
again,
but
i
don't
think
that
is
the
intent
behind
that
provision.
let
me
also
comment,
though,
there
is
an
important
problem
also
with
respondent's
position
with
respect
to
this...
how
you
read
the
word
try,
whether
there
is
content
in
the
word
try,
because
if
there
is
no
content
in
the
word
try,
there
is
no
stopping
point
to
their
position.
then
it's
okay
to
have
the
trial
before
a
committee.
then
it's
okay
to
have
the
trial
before
a
single
senator,
or
it's
okay,
as
the
senate
argued
below,
to
have
simply
a
paper
trial
where
you
just
introduce
a
transcript
and
have
the
senate
vote,
and
that
begins
to
look
very
much
like
a
proceeding
that
the
framers
expressly
rejected.
it
was
a
very
important
event
at
the
end
of
the...
towards
the
end
of
the
constitutional
convention,
when
john
dickinson
proposed
that
there
be
removal
of
judges
by
address.
it's
an
english
proceeding
which
also
had
been
incorporated
in
a
couple
of
state
constitutions.
in
removal
by
address
there
is
no
requirement
of
an
accusation
or
that
there
be
some
claim
of
offenses,
or
that
there
be
a
trial.
it's
simply
a
petition
presented
to
the
legislature
that
this
judge
be
removed,
and
when
he
presented
this
proposal
the
delegates
were
very
negative
about
it.
edmund
randolph
of
virginia
said
that
it
would
weaken
the
independence
of
judges.
james
wilson
of
pennsylvania
protested
that
this
would
make
judges
subject
to
every
gust
of
fashion,
so
they
clearly
intended
that
this
be
a
true
trial
proceeding,
and
removal
by
address
was
rejected,
and
i
think
once
this
court
adopts
or
permits
the
senate
to
adopt
the
short
cut
that
has
been
adopted
here,
there
is
no
stopping
point.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
i
think
that
comes
back
to
the
question
of
is
it
the
senate's
sole
power
to
decide
what
is
the
content,
or
is
it
this
court's
power
to
say
what
the
law
is,
to
construe
the
law,
and
i
think
an
impeachment,
just
as
in
questions
of
the
viability
of
a
commission
to
be
a
magistrate
of
the
district
of
columbia,
this
court
must
exercise
jurisdiction,
must
review
the
question
in
the
absence
of
anything
that
denies
jurisdiction
or
in
the
absence
of
any
indication
that
there
are
no
judiciable
standards
to
apply.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
so,
because
we
have
attempted
to
provide
the
line
we
think
needs
to
be
applied
here,
which
is
the
trial
is
the
opportunity
to
present
witnesses
and
to
confront
witnesses.
it
is
not--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--excuse
me.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
i
don't
understand.
a
mistake--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--the
admission
of
hearsay--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--your
honor,
i
think
there
has--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--i
wasn't
going
to
say
that.
[laughter]
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
i
appreciate
being
helped.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
well,
that's
like
if
there
was
a
two-thirds
requirement
and
they're
only
one
vote
short
of
two-thirds,
does
this
court
say
well
gee,
they
were
awful
close?
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
you
have
to
apply
the
constitutional
requirements
that
are
there.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
admissibility
questions
like
that,
whether...
one
of
the
impeachment
trials
in
1986
involved
papers
that
were...
the
argument
was
that
they
were
improperly
seized.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
i
think
that
is
the
irreducible
requirement,
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
that
is
the
point
at
which
you
would
have
to
have
a
court
look
at
the
question.
i
think
in
almost
all
instances
it
would
not
be
reviewable,
but
you
could
pose
a
hypothetical
where
you're
given
30
seconds
of
cross-examination...
you
could
pose
that
hypothetical
to
me
and
i
would
have
to
say
that
is
not
a
trial.
and
i
want
to
emphasize
here
that
we
really
are
talking
about
very
few
provisions
of
the
impeachment
trial
clause,
or
the
impeachment
clauses
generally,
that
would
be
reviewable:
the
two-thirds
majority,
the
requirement
that
the
chief
justice
preside
over
presidential
impeachments,
and
the
requirement
of
the
trial.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
well,
no,
i
think
there
would
be
certainly
be
an
obligation
on
defense
counsel
to
call
to
the
attention
of
the
court...
the
senate--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--as
a
court
that
there
is
the
absence
of
a
quorum.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
if
the
senate
is
so
reckless
as
to
ignore
it,
and
it
is
stated--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--we
state
it
on
the
record,
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
one
of
the
virtues
of
the
video
age
we're
in
is
that
the
senate
proceedings
are
now
televised.
there
would
be
wonderful
evidence
as
to
whether
there
was
a
quorum
present.
but
yes,
if
the
quorum
clause
is
to
be
enforced,
it
would
have
to
be
reviewed
by
the
court.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
your
honor,
that's--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--your
honor,
you
pose
a
very
difficult
question.
indeed,
it
would
leave
this
court
having
to
choose
which
constitutional
crisis
is
more
desirable...
to
have
a
president
removed
by
unconstitutional
means,
or
to
have
a
period
of
some
ambiguity,
admittedly,
while
that's
resolved
by
the
court.
it
could
be
resolved
with
dispatch.
the
pentagon
papers
case
took,
i
believe,
19
days
from
publication
until
the
decision
by
this
court.
it
would
have
to
be
resolved
with
dispatch.
but
if--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--your
honor,
i
think
the
most
pernicious
effect
on
the
constitution
and
on
the
history
of
this
country
would
be
if
this
court
would
simply...
and
the
courts
in
general
simply
avert
their
eyes
from
an
unconstitutional
impeachment
and
surely
an
unconstitutional
impeachment--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that
it
would
involve
the
interpretation
of
a
constitutional
provision
as
to
which
the
ordinary
processes
of
judicial
review
would
reasonably
be
applied,
and
again,
i
would
turn
back
to
the
pardon
clause.
the
failure
to
exclude
judicial
review
seems
to
us
extremely
articulate
here
and
important
for
the
construction
of
the
clause.
i
would
ask
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
i
might
address
only
a
couple
of
points,
quickly,
i'm
puzzled
by
the
statement
by
general
starr
that
the
senate
does
not
sit
as
a
jury.
counsel
for
the
senate,
whose...
he's
co-counsel
in
this
matter,
and
whom
he
represents
here
today,
told
the
senate
in
may
of
1989
that
it
sits
both
as
a
jury,
as
a
judge.
that's
in
the
record,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
is
unavoidable
in
this
case
that
the
senate
sits
as
a
jury.
i'd
like
to
also
address
a
final
point
to
justice
kennedy's
question
on
the
presidential
impeachment.
i
would
commend
to
the
court
the
twenty-fifth
amendment,
which
does
talk
about
what
you
do
in
a
situation
where
there
is
a
problem
with
removal
of
the
president.
i
would
agree,
the
removal
of
the
president
by
the
senate,
even
inappropriate
or
unconstitutional
removal,
means
he
is
no
longer
president,
but
there
is
an
opportunity
for
that
to
be
remedied
in
the
courts,
and
it
does
create
unwarranted
and
unhappy
ambiguity,
but
the
twenty-fifth
amendment
contemplates
that
in
the
case
of
presidential
incapacity.
there's
weeks
when
the
congress
can
review
that
issue.
that
ambiguity
will
proceed.
we
don't
embrace
it,
we
would
lament
it,
but
neither
can
the
court
shrink
from
deciding
the
constitutional
issue
that
would
be
presented.
finally,
i
would
say
that
it
is--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--that
is
not
reversible,
your
honor.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
and
of
course,
your
honor,
we're
not
saying
that
the
senator's
reasons
for
voting
are
subject
to
review
by
this
court.
if
the
senator
is
voting
to
impeach
a
female
judge
because
she's
a
woman
and
that
senator
doesn't
think
women
should
be
on
the
bench,
well
of
course,
that's
not
reviewable.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
we
are
not
going
to
the
decision.
they
can
reach
their
decision
how
they
want,
but
they
have
to
have
a
trial.
that's
what
the
framers
wanted.
they
knew...
they
were
familiar
with
the
caprice
of
human
nature
and
they
were
familiar
with
capricious
legislatures
and
they
knew
they
couldn't
control
them,
but
what
they
did
provide
was
that
there
had
to
be
a
trial
and
a
procedure
that
would
lead
to
a
real
demonstration
of
guilt
or
innocence
and
hope
to
lead
them
to
be
responsible
legislators.
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
if
i
may
answer
the
question--
mr.
david
overlock
stewart
--i
think
not
only
do
i
say
it
must
be
you,
but
in
fact
general
starr
has
clarified
that
point
by
saying
it
must
be
you
when
it's
a
two-thirds
vote,
and
it
must
be
you
on
other
provisions,
and
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
we
really
have
presented
a
right
to
be
enforceable.
thank
you.
