justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
would
you
do
if
the
senate
did
not
allow
the
accused
official
to
face
and
confront
the
witnesses
against
him?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
senate
says
you
can't
cross-examine
any
of
the
witnesses
against
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
can't
be
in
the
room
when
they're
testifying.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
the
standard?
if
you
can
refer
to
a
word
in
the
constitution
to
resolve
the
issue,
then
we
have
jurisdiction,
is
that
about
the
way
it
goes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
accused
official
waive
the
right
that
you
claim
is
his?
suppose
an
official
says
this
is
very
complicated
testimony
and
i
want
senators
who
can
focus
on
the
testimony,
and
the
senate
says
we'll
have
the
evidence
presented
before
a
committee
of
15
senators,
and
he
wants
that,
can
he
do
that
and
then
refer
the
matter
to
the
whole
senate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you
were
a
senator
i
take
it
you
would
stand
up
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
and
say
i
must
point
out
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
proceeding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
you'd
have
the
obligation
to
tell
your
colleagues
that
they
are
proceeding
in
an
unconstitutional
manner,
wouldn't
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
actually,
you
don't
come
to
us,
you
come
to
the
district
court--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
then
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
then
to
this
court,
and
in
the
case,
say,
of
an
impeachment
of
the
president,
that
could
go
on
easily
21/2
years,
i
should
think,
probably
3--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
think
you
ought
to
address
the
argument
that
the
solicitor
general
makes
that
this
would
put
this
nation
at
grave
risk
in
the
event
of
an
impeachment
of
the
president
that
was
winding
its
way
through
the
courts
on
judicial
review.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
not
just
the
delay.
it
means
that
judges,
some
of
whom
have
been
appointed
by
the
president
who's
being
impeached
will
be
involved
in
the
process
and
the
integrity
and
the
independence
of
the
court
may
come
into
question,
which
would
cause
severe
damage
to
the
courts
as
an
institution
over
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
the
committee
hearings
part
of
the
trial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
i
take
it
if
the
president
were
impeached
and
a
committee
was
sitting
the
chief
justice
would
preside
over
the
committee.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
would
have
to
if
it's
part
of
the
trial,
wouldn't
he?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
do
want
us
to
rule
that
the
question
of
the
meaning
of
trial
is
textually
committed
to
the
senate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
do
want
us
to
rule--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
leaves
open
the
two-thirds
vote,
the
quorum
and
all
those
other
issues,
for
future
litigation,
then.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
say...
if
that's
the
operative
word
that
you
say
the
senate
must
construe,
i
take
it
then
you
don't
rely
on
sole
power.
your
argument
would
be
the
same
if
it
said
the
senate
shall
try.
