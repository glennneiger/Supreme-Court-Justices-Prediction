chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
91-740,
walter
l.
nixon
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
stewart,
you
refer
to
it
as
the
impeachment
trial
clause.
it
says
the
senate
shall
have
the
sole
power
to
try
all
impeachment...
you
might
just
as
well
refer
to
it
as
the
sole
power
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
you
know,
certainly
that
would
be
a
fairly
partial
way
to
refer
to
it.
i
think
to
call
it
the
impeachment
trial
clause
is
an
equally
partial
way
to
refer
to
it.
you're
entitled
to
do
it,
certainly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
stewart,
do
you
think
the
high
crimes
and
misdemeanors
language
is
such
that
the
interpretation
by
this
court
could
supersede
that
of
the
senate?
in
other
words,
supposing
your
client
were
in
a
position
where
he
had
been
removed
from
office
but
instead
of
claiming
that
the
trial
requirement
that
you
see
there
had
not
been
met,
he
said
i
was
not
guilty
of
anything
that
could
be
called
a
high
crime
or
misdemeanor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
the
language
have
meant,
in
your
view,
if
the
word
sole
were
not
there,
if
it
simply
said
the
senate
shall
have
the
power
to
try
all
impeachments?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stewart,
in
both
the
trial
of
samuel
chase
and
the
trial
of
andrew
johnson
there
was
a
great
deal
of
motion
being
made
and
demands
made
for
continuance
on
the
part
of
the
defendants,
and
the
senate
insisted
in
both
cases
that
they
be
brought
to
trial
much
more
rapidly
than
would
be
conceivable
in
an
ordinary
criminal
case.
you
know,
they
were
given
something
like
10
days
to
prepare.
is
that
something
that
would
be
reviewable
as
an
incident
of
a
trial
if
the
claim
were
made
that
we
simply
did
not
have
a
fair
opportunity
to
prepare?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
you
say
that
if
you're
going
to
be
divested
of
the
office
of
associate
justice
or
of
president
that
10
days
was
sufficient
to
prepare?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
would
read
the
trial
clause
differently
if
you're
dealing
with
a
lower
court
judge
than
if
you're
dealing
with
some
highly
visible
official?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
an
ambassador?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
an
ambassador
is
not
an
individual,
then,
in
your
view.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
applying
the
confrontation
clause
to
the
admission
of
hearsay...
you
know,
various
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule?
is
that
challengeable
on
the
grounds
that
the
senate
improperly
applied
the
hearsay
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
failure
to
allow
cross-examination
is
raisable
in
your
view.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
an
undue
shortening
of
cross-examination?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
stewart.
general
starr,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
starr--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--supposing
that
during
an
impeachment
trial
of
the
senate
the
chief
justice
dies,
and
the
senate
says
well,
there's
by
statute
created
the
office
of
vice
chief
justice.
we're
going
to
let
him
preside,
because
it
would
just
be
catastrophic
to
wait
for
the
appointment
of
a
chief
justice
while
this
impeachment
is
pending.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
impeachment
of
the
president.
can
the
senate
not
do
that
because
of
the
specific
language
the
chief
justice
shall
preside?
would
that
action
by
the
senate
followed
by
the
presiding
by
the
vice
chief
justice
be
judicially
reviewable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
mr.
stewart,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
91-740,
nixon
against
the
united
states.
petitioner
walter
l.
nixon,
a
former
united
states
district
judge
was
convicted
by
jury
of
making
false
statements
before
a
federal
grand
jury
and
he
was
sentenced
to
prison.
as
a
result
of
this
conviction,
the
house
of
representatives
adopted
articles
of
impeachment
charging
nixon
with
giving
false
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
and
were
bringing
disrepute
on
the
federal
judiciary.
thereafter
the
senate
invokes
its
own
rule
xi
under
which
the
presiding
officer
appoints
a
committee
of
senators
to
receive
evidence
and
take
testimony.
after
conducting
four
days
of
hearings
the
committee
presented
the
full
senate
with
a
complete
transcript
of
the
proceeding
and
a
report
which
stated
uncontested
facts
and
summarized
the
evidence.
the
senate
voted
by
more
than
the
constitutionally
required
two
thirds
majority
to
convict
nixon
on
the
first
two
articles
of
impeachment.
nixon
then
filed
the
present
lawsuit
charging
that
senate
rule
xi
violates
the
constitutional
grant
of
authority
to
the
senate
to
try
all
impeachments
because
it
prohibits
the
whole
senate
from
taking
part
of
the
evidentiary
proceeding.
the
district
court
held
that
nixon's
claim
was
nonjusticiable
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
colombia
circuit
agreed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
nixon's
claim
is
nonjusticiable.
a
controversy
is
notjusticiable
when
there
is
a
textually
demonstrable
constitutional
commitment
of
the
issue
to
coordinate
political
department
or
a
lack
of
judicially
manageable
standards
for
resolving
it.
as
our
opinion
makes
clear
these
two
concepts
are
not
completely
separate.
the
language
and
structure
of
the
impeachment
trial
clause,
which
comes
from
article
i
section
3
clause
6
of
the
constitution
supports
this
conclusion.
that
clause
reads
"the
senate
shall
have
the
sole
power
to
try
all
impeachments".
when
sitting
for
that
purpose
they
shall
be
an
author
affirmation.
when
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
tried,
the
chief
justice
shall
preside,
and
no
person
shall
be
convicted
without
the
concurrence
of
two-thirds
of
the
members
present.
the
first
sentence
is
a
grant
of
authority
to
the
senate
and
the
presence
of
the
word
"sole"
indicates
that
this
authority
is
reposed
in
the
senate
and
nowhere
else.
we
reject
nixon's
argument
that
the
word
"try"
in
the
first
sentence
requires
the
senate
to
conduct
a
judicial
type
trial.
the
word
"try"
both
in
1787
and
today
has
considerably
broader
meanings
than
those
to
which
petitioner
would
limit
it.
our
conclusion
that
the
impeachment
trial
clause
lacks
sufficient
precision
to
afford
any
judicially
manageable
standard
of
review
is
fortified
by
the
existence
of
the
three
very
specific
requirements
which
the
clause
does
impose.
members
must
be
under
oath,
two-thirds
vote
is
required
to
convict,
and
when
the
president
was
tried
the
chief
justice
presides.
in
addition
to
the
textual
commitment,
we
are
persuaded
that
the
lack
of
finality
and
the
difficulty
of
fashioning
relief
counsel
against
justiciability.
judicial
review
of
the
procedures
used
by
the
senate
in
trying
impeachments
would
expose
the
political
life
of
the
country
to
months
or
perhaps
years
of
uncertainty
particularly
if
the
president
were
tried.
so
we
hold
that
the
word
"try"
in
the
impeachment
clause
does
not
provide
an
identifiable
textual
limit
on
the
authority
which
is
committed
to
the
senate.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
affirmed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
the
concurring
opinion;
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
blackmun
has
joined;
justice
souter
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment.
