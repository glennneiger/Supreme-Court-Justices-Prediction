mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
rule
xi
of
the
united
states
senate
was
adopted
in
1935.
that
rule
permits
but
it
does
not
require
the
appointment
of
a
committee
for
a
limited
function
of
gathering
evidence,
and
in
crafting
that
rule
the
senate
was
responding
to
its
own
experience,
because
with
the
growth
in
that
body's
responsibilities,
at
times
evidence
was
being
presented
before
a
virtually
empty
senate
chamber.
in
fashioning
that
rule,
the
senate
was
exercising
a
power
that
was
entrusted
to
it
by
the
constitution...
by
article
1,
section
3,
clause
6...
which
vests
sole
power
in
the
senate
to
try
all
impeachments.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
is
very
possible
that
that
would
be
the
case,
but
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
that
is
quite
arguably
the
case,
justice
kennedy.
i
do
think,
by
the
way,
that
the
senate
would
see
fit
not
to
use
that
procedure
with
respect
to
the
impeachment
of
a
president
or
a
justice
of
this
court,
and
again,
i
think
it's
important
to
know
where
did
this
rule
come
from
and
why?
it
was
first
suggested
in
1904,
based
on
experience,
a
sense
on
the
part
of...
a
felt
sense
on
the
part
of
senators,
some
of
whom
had
served
in
the
house
of
representatives,
had
been
impeachment
managers
themselves,
and
who
were
sharply
critical
of
the
way
in
which
the
process
was
now
working.
and
certainly
that
has
been
of
concern
to
the
senate
since,
in
1985,
we
had
the
spectacle
of
a
united
states
district
judge
who
had
been
duly
convicted
of
a
crime,
that
conviction
had
been
affirmed
on
appeal,
and
a
suggestion
had
been
made
by
the
judicial
conference
of
the
united
states
that
impeachment
might
be
appropriate.
we
have
had,
unfortunately,
three
impeachments
in
recent
years,
and
the
senate
has
been
concerned,
therefore,
about
the
orderliness
of
the
proceedings
and
yet
the
fairness
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
justice
scalia,
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
senate
was
not
of
one
mind
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
of
rule
xi.
there
were
clearly
some
members
of
the
senate
who
thought
this
was
improper,
and
i
think,
by
the
way,
that's
one
of
the
redeeming
aspects
of
this.
the
senate
has
taken
this
very
seriously,
has
examined
the
constitutional
questions
very
seriously,
and
it
is
true
that,
as
mr.
stewart
has
noted,
that
senator
ashurst,
the
chairman
of
the
judiciary
committee
in
1935
expressed
that
view,
that
he
contemplated
that
it
would
be
an
optional
procedure,
but
other
senators
didn't
agree
with
that,
and
that
certainly
is
not
what
the
rule
itself
contemplates.
it's
the
judgment
of
the
senate
as
to
whether
it's
appropriate
or
not,
and
particularly
given
here,
in
the
modern
age,
where...
and
this
was
referred
to
by
mr.
stewart...
we
now
live
in
the
age
where
proceedings
are
videotaped.
these
were
videotaped.
they
were
broadcast
live,
and
a
full
transcript
of
the
proceedings
was
made
available
to
all
of
the
senate,
and
then...
this,
i
think,
in
terms
of
what
happened
here,
the
argument
has
thus
far
been
at
the
level
of
the
abstract.
let
me,
if
i
may,
make
one
very
concrete
point.
judge
nixon
appeared
before
the
entire
united
states
senate.
he
answered
questions
before
the
entire
united
states
senate.
he
faced
them
as
his
judges.
they
are
not
jurors.
they
are
senators
who
remain
members
of
the
united
states
senate
who
take
a
constitutional
oath
and
who
sit
in
judgment,
and
he
and
his
able
counsel
argued
evidentiary
points.
and
at
no
point
in
those
proceedings
while
their
motion
for
a
full
trial
was
there...
there
was
no
waiver
of
that.
i'm
not
suggesting
this.
but
in
terms
of
what
happened
in
these
proceedings,
not
one
word
was
mentioned
with
respect
to
invoking
that
part
of
rule
xi
which
permits
the
senate
to
bring
specific
witnesses
before
them.
in
fact,
to
the
contrary.
one
of
the
characters
who
appeared
in
this
unfortunate
drama
was
a
lawyer
in
hattiesburg
named
carroll
ingram.
in
his
closing
argument,
mr.
stewart
said,
look
at
the
videotape
of
carroll
ingram.
you
will
believe
carroll
ingram.
the
senate
sat
there
with
the
quorum,
with
great
dignity,
asking
questions
through
written
questions
promulgated
by
the
presiding
officer.
not
once
was
the
united
states
senate
urged
to
bring
a
specific
witness.
in
fact,
the
argument
presented
to
the
united
states
senate
in
this
case
was,
we
want
you
to
go
through
this
mountain
of
materials,
and
you
will
see
so
many
contradictions
and
testimony
by
various
and
sundry
witnesses
that
the
case
against
judge
nixon
falls
apart.
let
me
come
back
to
the
theoretical
point.
the
theoretical
point
is
what
impeachment
means.
we
don't
rest
our
submission
on
sole
power
to
try.
we
think
that
is
indicative
of
the
framers'
intent,
but
our
submission
rests
in
part
on
the
structure
of
the
constitution
itself
and
what
impeachment
means,
as
well
as
the
fact
that
the
end
result
of
impeachment
of
an
officer
of
the
executive
branch
or
an
officer
of
the
judiciary
is
a
judgment.
and
the
constitution
by
its
terms
contemplates,
says
that
the
president,
vice
president
and
all
civil
officers
shall
be
removed
upon
conviction.
as
justice
kennedy
put
it,
how
unthinkable
it
would
be
for
the
conviction
of
a
president
of
the
united
states
to
then
be
subject
to
judicial
review.
the
text
itself
contemplates
finality,
but
more
than
that,
when
we
go
back
to
the
framing
we
know
that
what
was
in
the
minds
of
the
framers
was
a
process
of
checking
the
civil
officers
of
government
outside
the
article
i
branch.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
you
have
the
raw
power
to
do
that,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
a
constitutional
act.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
that
is
right,
because
the
judgment
is
what
removes.
what
happened
here
was,
judge
nixon
sued
several
individuals,
but
they
carry
on
administerial
functions
in
this
connection...
the
secretary
of
state,
the
recipient
of
the
document,
and
so
forth.
he
has
not
asked
for
that
sort
of
injunctive
relief,
and
so
yes,
i
think
while
it
is
theoretically
possibly,
it
is
unthinkable
that
the
court
would
actually
issue
a
stay
of
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--precisely.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct.
in
that
particular
instance,
the
district
judge
saw
fit
to
stay
his
own
judgment.
we
think
that
was
quite
wise
of
the
district
judge--
[laughter]
but
it
does
suggest
that
with
a
large
judiciary,
not
only,
unfortunately,
are
impeachments
going
to
now
happen
with
greater
regularity
than
in
our
first
two
centuries
of
existence...
we
have
about
800
article
iii
judges.
does
this
represent
a
threat
to
judicial
independence,
the
use
of
this
committee
proceedings?
i
say
with
all
respect
that
no
one
who
has
made
a
study...
and
i've
watched
all
the
videotapes,
i've
watched
the
entirety
of
the
proceeding,
and
i
don't
think
that
anyone
who
watches
those
proceedings
will
come
away
with
the
sense
at
all
that
this
proceeding
represents
a
threat
to
judicial
independence.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
i
do--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
it
was
not
necessary,
but
i
think,
justice
stevens,
that
clearly
a
majority
of
the
senators
did
feel...
and
i
know
mr.
stewart's
position
is
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
a
separate
proceeding
that
must
involve
a
sense
of
what
the
evidence
was
in
the
case,
and
that's
the
sober
judgment
of
the
senators.
and
one
of
the
points
i
would
like
to
leave
the
court
with
today
is
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
senate
has
been
sober
in
its
judgment
is
its
sense
that
this
is
it,
this
is
the
end
of
the
road,
this
is
our
judgment.
they
take
that
responsibility
quite
seriously.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
to
convict.
if
there
are
articles...
we
do
agree
that
there
must
be
articles
of
impeachment
presented,
exhibited
to
the
senate,
but
once
that
is
done,
yes,
justice
white,
they
have
the
power
to
do
that,
and
some
members
of
the
senate
have
expressed
the
view
that
no
one
should
remain
sitting
on
the
federal
bench
who's
been
duly
convicted
of
a
felony.
others
have
said,
well,
but
look,
senator
mathias
in
some
reflections
in
the
mid-1980's
said
there
are
some
strange
felonies
on
the
books.
in
idaho,
it
is
a
felony
to
poison
a
neighbor's
cat.
perhaps
that
would
not
be
automatic...
but
this
was
obviously
a
serious
matter.
judge
nixon
feels
that
this
entire
proceeding
was
wrong-headed,
was
vexatious,
was
unjust,
but
those
points
were
presented
to
the
courts,
were
exhaustively
examined
by
the
courts,
and
were
exhaustively
examined
by
the
house
of
representatives,
as
reflected
by
the
statements
of
the
floor
manager,
the
impeachment
manager,
representatives
edwards,
who
said
he
was
concerned
about
possible
department
of
justice
misconduct.
they
examined
carefully
whether
there
had
been
misconduct
and
found
no
evidence
of
it.
that
was
the
same
result
found
in
a
2255
proceeding
after
a
2-day
hearing
in
jackson,
mississippi.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we'd
have
to
accept...
i
think
this
court's
decisions
in
ballin
and
field
v.
clark
say
we
accept
the
records
of
the
senate.
we
do
not
impeach
those
records--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
that
the
judgment
still
stands.
i
think
we
are
moving
closer
to
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--possible
arena
of
powell
v.
mccormack.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
think
that
as
long
as
the
records
themselves
are
being
accepted,
that
it
does
seem
to
us
that
we
are
in
the
arena
of
powell
v.
mccormack
at
that
stage.
that
was
part
of
the
insight
of
powell,
and
powell's
looking
to
the
text
but
looking
to
more
than
that,
looking
to
the
history
of
the
text
and
to
understand
the
intent
of
the
framers,
and
that
two-thirds
majority
requirement
is
very
important
in
the
opinion
of
the
framers
for
the
very
reason
that
this
was
to
be
a
very
considerable
check
by
the
united
states
senate
on
the
house
of
representatives
that
might
get
carried
away.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
former
because
of
the
latter,
that
the
text
itself,
when
we
also
contemplate
the
structure
of
the
constitution
and
the
purpose
of
impeachment
in
our
system
of
separated
powers,
that
it
does
satisfy,
it
seems
to
us,
at
a
minimum
two
of
the
criteria
laid
down
by
this
court
in
baker
v.
carr,
a
textual
commitment
to
the
senate.
why
do
we
say
that?
the
reason
we
say
that
is
because
the
grant
of
the
sole
power
to
try
in
our
judgment
carries
with
it
the
power
to
determine
the
procedures
that
will
be
employed.
that's
a...
it's
not
expressed,
i
concede
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
we
do,
but
even
if...
and
this
court
has
struggled,
as
have
we
and
others,
with
the
political
question
doctrine.
i
also
commend
to
the
court's
careful
attention
judge
randolph's
concurring
opinion
in
which
he
says,
political
question
doctrine
difficulties
aside,
louis
hinken
and
all
that,
what
i
see
when
i
read
the
entire
text
is
a
commitment
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
interpretation
there
is
no
role
for
the
court
to
play
with
respect
to
what
procedures
should
be
employed.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
does
indeed.
it
seems
to
us
that
when
we
look
at
the
entirety,
that
full
paragraph
of
clause
6,
there
are
three
procedures
that
are
enumerated.
a
violation
of
one
of
those
enumerated
procedures
brings
us,
in
our
view,
into
the
domain
contemplated
by
this
court
in
powell
v.
mccormack.
we
have
not
challenged
powell
v.
mccormack,
so
if
there
is
a
violation
of
one
of
those
procedures,
it
seems
to
us
that
is
a
justiciable
claim,
but
the
claim
here
is
a
very
limited
one.
all
of
the
evidence
should
have
been
adduced,
no
matter
how
detailed,
about...
wiley
fairchild's
drinking
habits
and
listening
to
hank
williams
sr.
music
should
all
be
laid
before
the
full
senate,
day
after
day
after
day.
that's
the
claim,
and
that,
we
think,
is
a
judgment
that
the
senate
can
take
into
account
in
determining
whether
to
employ
rule
11,
but
recall
again,
rule
11,
not
only
is
it
not
obligatory,
but
after
the
committee
has
worked
its
will,
the
committee
itself...
and
several
members
of
the
committee
did,
by
the
way.
senator
heflin
served
on
the
committee,
and
when
the
issue
came,
when
judge
nixon
said,
i
want
my
motion
for
a
full
trial
heard
before
the
united
states
senate,
it
was
overwhelmingly
rejected
by
the
senate,
but
several
members
of
the
committee
voted
in
favor
of
that.
these
are
judgments,
and
judgments
are
going
to
differ
just
as
they
do
on
this
court,
but
it's
a
sober
and
a
solemn
judgment,
and
one
of
the
reasons
is,
is
because
it
is
a
final
judgment.
that's
what--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
seems
to
me...
they
might
have
to
call
it
a
trial
in
one
sense,
but
justice
white,
here's
the
reason
i'm
struggling
with
that.
i
think
the
word
try
meant
something
different
to
the
framers.
we've
cited--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--they
have
to
fit
it
within
the
word
try.
now,
what
did
the
framers
mean
by
try,
and
we
have
given
to
the
court
the
1755
samuel
johnson
dictionary...
to
examine
or
to
examine
as
a
judge...
and
just
as
this
court
examines
as
a
judge
in
original
cases
by
having
a
special
master
do,
by
the
way,
considerably
more,
and
you
don't
appoint
one
of
your
own
members
as
the
special
master,
you
have
appointed
either
a
retired
judge
or
even
someone
who
has
never
exercised
article
iii
powers
as
a
special
master.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
because
you
use
the
word
automatic,
it
concerns
me
as
to
whether
there,
justice
white,
is
that
examination
as
a
judge.
the
application...
and
it
does
seem
to
me...
and
mr.
stewart
does
have
a
point
that
there
must
be
an
individualized
judgment
in
an
impeachment,
and
if
the
senate
says
we're
so
tired
of
all
these
impeachment
that
here's
our
automatic
rule.
you're
out
if
you've
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
and
we're
not
going
to
listen
to
anything
at
all.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
might
be
in
terms
of
whether
there
was
an
examination
at
all,
whether
the
senate
was
examining
as
a
judge,
but
it
might
be.
it
is
totally
unthinkable...
and
i
don't
think
that
in
any
way
takes
away
from
the
integrity
of
our
submission
that
the
procedures,
the
specific
procedures
that
are
going
to
be
used
in
coming
to
judgment,
as
opposed
to
an
automatic
rule
that
you
are
automatically
divested
of
office,
but
the
procedures
that
are
used
in
coming
to
judgment
we
think
has
been
textually
entrusted
to
the
senate,
and
for
good
reasons...
for
the
reasons
of
finality
as
well
as
the
structural.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
correct,
because
as
we've
noted
in
our
brief,
rufus
king,
one
of
the
delegates
who
also
served
on
the
committee
of
style,
referred
to
the
president
and
members
of
the
legislature
being
tried
by
their
electors--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--a
judgment...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
if
i
concede
that...
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
language.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no.
no,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
would
not
concede
that,
because
it
seems
to
me
that...
and
now
i'm
going
to
be
formalistic,
and
that
is
i'm
going
to
rely
on
the
sole...
the
grant
of
that
sole
power
to
try,
it
seems
to
me,
carries
with
it
the
interpretive
power
to
determine
what
the
procedures
are
going
to
be.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
but...
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
in
two
structurally
different
domains.
what
we
know
of
the
decision
of
the
founding
laws
is
that
this
was
the
body,
the
numerous
court
that
would
hear--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--and
sit
in
judgment.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no.
the
reason
we
concede
that
is
because
of
the
structure
as
we
understand
the
law
to
be,
and
that
is,
under
powell
v.
mccormack,
we
look,
as
the
court
did...
may
i
say
just
a
word
about
powell?
powell
said,
we
have
this
term,
qualifications.
what
does
that
mean?
the
house
of
representatives
has
come
up
with
its
own
view.
we
have
difficulty
with
that,
powell
v.
mccormack
said,
because
we
see
that
there's
a
specific
definition
in
the
constitution,
and
more
than
that,
we
go
to
history
and
we
understand
that
in
terms
of
democratic
theory
it
was
very
important
for
that
definition
in
the
text
of
the
constitution
to
be
it.
the
house
could
not
go
beyond
that,
beyond
that
text.
here
it
seems
to
us
that
when
we
look
at
the
text
as
a
whole
the
two-thirds
requirement
was
viewed
as
critically,
pivotally
important
at
the
founding
in
terms
of
protection
of
civil
officers
against
abuse.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it's
the
fact--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--you're
using
the
term
emphasis,
and
without
trying
to
quibble,
i'm
trying
to
say,
justice
souter,
that
i
am
emphasizing
the
fact
that
the
text
itself
specifically
defines
what
the
majority
is.
it's
not
five-eighths,
its
two-thirds.
the
text
answers
that,
and
powell
v.
mccormack
says
this
court
can
and
should
vindicate
that.
the
real
analogy
would
be,
therefore,
if
exactly
the
hypothetical
you
posit
existed
in
the
text.
mr.
stewart's
difficulty
is
the
text
does
not
yield
up
an
answer
to
the
question
of
what
does
it
mean
to
try.
we
have
sought
to
divine
its
meaning
by
going
back
to
18th
century
materials,
but
the
text
doesn't
yield
up
the
answer,
and
if
the
text
itself
doesn't
yield
up
the
answer,
there
is
more
than
one
way
to
go
about
a
trial,
thus,
the
use
of
special
masters
is
a
way
to
go
about
a
trial.
the
use
of
united
states
magistrates
is
the
way
to
go
about
a
trial.
the
article
iii
officer
does
not
necessarily
have
to
be
there
for
the
taking
of
all
evidence,
and
by
the
way...
may
i
make
this
point
+/?
mr.
stewart
found
it
very
difficult,
and
i
think
he
is
finding
it
difficult
here
today,
to
create
this
image,
the
perfect
set
of
a
fact-finding
body.
in
his
colloquy
with
justice
scalia,
he
admitted
that
they
do
not
sit
as
jurors,
as
fact-finders
in
that
sense.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
this
is
the
impeachment
of
the
president.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
seems
to
me
that
under
our
theory
i
have
to
admit
that
if
the
chief
justice,
whoever
it
be,
he
or
she,
the
acting
chief
justice
is
not
in
the
chair,
then
that
is
judicially
reviewable.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
it
is
a
most
appropriate
first
question--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--to
answer,
and
yet--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
don't
think
it
divests
you
of...
i
think
you
have
jurisdiction,
obviously,
to
decide
that,
but
the
most--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
seems
to
me
that
while
you're
not
drained
of
jurisdiction
to
do
that,
in
terms
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
exercise
of
the
judicial
power,
if
in
fact
the
matter
has
been
entrusted
to
another
branch,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
part
of
your
duty
to
resolve
that
question
first
as
opposed
to
saying
that
is
such
a
difficult
question,
but
it's
actually
easy
for
us
when
we
move
to
the
merits
to
say
this
is
a
perfectly
sensible
procedure.
i
do
think
that
it
is
the
court's
obligation
to
wrestle
with
the
judiciability
question
as
to
whether
it's
appropriate
for
you
to
examine
the
merits
of
what
the
senate
did.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
it
is,
under--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
suggest
a
difficulty
with
the
automatic
rule
that
we're
not
going
to
consider
anything
at
all
because
we
have
an
automatic
rule
which
we're
going
to
apply,
because
it
does
seem
to
me
that
the
term
try
means
that
you're
coming
to
judgment,
but
yes,
if
you--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
it
does...
i'm
sorry,
in
the
abstract,
of
course
it
has
meaning,
but
who's
going
to
give
content
to
the
meaning
in
our
view
is
the
senate.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
but
justice
scalia,
my
point
is
this.
even
though
you
as
a
judge,
as
a
justice,
do
not
agree
with
the
senate's
definition,
our
point
is
it's
their
power
to
decide,
and
even
though
you
say,
gee--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
that's
fine,
if
you
want
to
view
that
as
nonjudiciable,
that's
fine.
[laughter]
we
have
not
submitted...
we
have
not
in
any
way--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--if
i
may
say
so
with
all
respect,
that
may
be
the
difficulty
that
you're
having
with
powell
v.
mccormack
as
opposed
to
our
submission.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
absolutely.
it
has
been
entrusted
to
the
senate,
for
reasons
that
go
beyond
the
text
and
include
the
structure
and
the
purpose
of
impeachment.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
justice
white,
my
theory
has
to...
leads
me
to
answer
that
question
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
but
will
you
permit
me
also
to
say
that
will
not
happen,
and
we
saw
that,
by
the
way,
in
1986,
when
there
was
a
hue
and
cry
by
virtue
of
the
decision
of
the
11th
circuit
in
the
infamous
allday
case,
and
thoughtful
consideration
was
given
by
the
house
of
representatives...
i'm
sorry.
i
thank
the
court.
