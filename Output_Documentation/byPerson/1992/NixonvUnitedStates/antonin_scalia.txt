justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
be
partial.
the
other
side's
going
to
be
partial,
too.
that's
the
system
we
have
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
all
right.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
think
it
is
a
trial
if
people
who
haven't
been
present
at
the
proceedings
come
in
and
vote.
you
consider
that
a
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
how
you're
drawing
the
line
between
the
one
and
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
a
trial
means
you
present
evidence
before
someone
who
then
decides,
the
person
to
whom
the
evidence
has
been
presented.
you
say
that's
not
what
a
trial
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
a
quorum
present
during
the
trial,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
can
be
a
different...
your
point
is,
it
can
be
a
different
quorum.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
portion
of
the
senate
can
hear
the
evidence,
and
another
portion
vote,
and
that's
a
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it's
undesirable.
i
don't
think
it's
a
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
when
the
constitution
gives
this
court
original
jurisdiction
in
certain
matters...
those,
for
example,
in
which
a
state
is
a
party,
don't
you
think
that
meant
that
the
trial
would
be
before
us?
isn't
that
what
original
jurisdiction
meant
to
the
framers?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
doesn't
use
the
word
try,
but
doesn't
original
jurisdiction
contemplate
that
the
trial
would
be
before
the
supreme
court,
and
yet
we
do
exactly
what
you
say
can't
be
done
in
the
senate
trial.
that
is,
have
a
master
take
the
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
doesn't
necessarily
follow.
i
mean,
i
can
agree
with
you
that
the
word
trial
has
to
have
some
content,
but
i
can
disagree
that
we
are
the
ones
to
enforce
it.
i
mean,
can
i
believe
it
has
indeed
a
content
but
it's
up
to
the
senate
to
assure
that
that
content
has
been
faithfully
complied
with?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
are
running
a
slippery
slope
kind
of
an
argument...
if
trial
doesn't
mean
anything,
where
does
it
end?
the
slippery
slope
goes
down
the
other
side
of
the
hill,
too,
doesn't
it?
if
we
say
that
the
trial
does
have
a
content,
then
we
have
to
begin
to
decide
what
other
things
are
connected
with
trial.
there
are
all
sorts
of
imaginable
things
that
trial
ordinarily
entails.
are
we
going
to
be
reviewing
all
of
those?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
if
there's
a
mistake
made
so
that
one
element
is
not
there?
is
the
whole
thing
automatically
invalid,
or
is
there
some
harmless
error
concept?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know
harmless
error.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
whatever.
let's
assume
at
one
brief
portion,
when
very
unimportant
evidence
was
being
presented,
it
dropped
below
a
quorum.
that
invalidates
the
whole
proceeding,
or
is
there
a
harmless
error
rule?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
you
say
there's
a
harmless
error
rule,
i'm
going
to
say,
well
then
we
have
to
evaluate
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
don't
we?
so
you
better
not
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there's
no
harmless
error
rule
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
slightest
mistake,
and
the
whole
thing
goes
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
two-thirds
majority,
you
would
have
witnesses
in
the
chamber
who
would...
i
mean,
is
it
only
what...
you
said
before,
if
it
appears
in
the
record
that
there
is
not
a...
why
does
it
have
to
appear
in
the
record?
couldn't
you
have
witnesses
come
in
with
affidavits
saying
i
was
there,
and
although
nobody
in
the
senate
asked
for
a
quorum
call,
there
was
not
a
quorum?
wouldn't
we
have
to
accept
that?
why
does
it
have
to
be
in
the
record?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
the
senate
ignores
it.
the
presiding
officer--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
you'd
come
to
us
with
your
affidavits
and
say
there
was
not
a
quorum.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we're
going
to
judge
whether
there
was
a
quorum
in
the
senate
on
the
basis
of
affidavits
provided
by
your
witnesses.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stewart,
don't
you
think
that
framers
who
had
enough
foresight
to
provide
for
original
jurisdiction
by
this
court
in
cases
involving
ambassadors,
in
cases
involving
the
states,
would
also
have
had
enough
foresight
to
provide
for
original
jurisdiction
by
this
court
if
they
thought
that
the
courts
were
being
able
to
review
at
least
impeachments
of
the
president?
but
it
doesn't
appear
in
the
original
jurisdiction
clause.
this
problem
you've
just
been
discussing
with
justice
kennedy
is
an
obvious
problem
that
anyone
would
consider,
wending
its
way
up
to
the
supreme
court,
impeachment
of
the
president.
it
would
have
been
in
the
original
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
general
starr,
when
that
rule
was
adopted
in
1904
according
to
your
opponent
here
it
was
contemplated
that
it
would
be
voluntary
on
the
part
of
the
person
being
impeached,
and
indeed,
maybe
many
of
them
would
prefer
to
be
tried
by
12
senators
who
were
there
than
by
100
who
weren't,
so
one
can
see
why
that
would
have
some
attraction.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
could
issue
a
stay
pending
appeal,
general
starr,
i
guess,
right...
a
stay
or
removal
pending
appeal,
or
something
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
would
we
direct
that
to,
the
senate?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
the
removal
is
automatic.
the
senate
doesn't
do
the
removal.
it
occurs
by
virtue
of
the
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
notice
in
the
recent
district
court
there
has
been
a
district
court
judgment
reversing
an
impeachment
of
another
judge--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
end
of
the
judgment
was
that
the
case
is
remanded
to
the
senate.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
well
be,
general
starr.
you
know,
it
was
all
very
good
in
this
case,
but
you're
really
arguing
before
us
that
it
really
doesn't
matter
whether
it
was
very
good
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
could
have
impeached
him
for
poisoning
a
neighbor's
cat--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
called
that
a
high
crime
and
misdemeanor
and
you'd
say
that's
good
enough
for
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
there
could
have
not
been
a
quorum
present.
if
there
was
no
quorum
present,
would
we
be
able
to
review
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
it's
clear
on
the
records
of
the
senate
that
there
was
not
a
quorum
present?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
admit--
--general
starr,
do
you
think
this
question
of
reviewability
is
a
front-end
jurisdictional
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
starr,
if
i
understand
your
theory,
you're
quite
right
trial
does
not
have
a
precise
content,
but
surely
it
has
some
content.
i
mean,
there's
something
that
it's
just
not
a
trial.
let's
say
we
refuse
to
hear
a
whole
bunch
of
relevant
evidence
because
we're
too
busy,
we
don't
want
to
waste
any
more
time.
now,
that's...
is
that
a
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
you
refuse
to
hear
to
hear
all
evidence,
you
just
don't
let
the
defendant
put
on
any
evidence
at
all.
is
that
a
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
not
a
trial,
in
your
view?
is
there
anything
that
is
not
a
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
an
artificial
system
you're
setting
up
when
you
say
two-thirds
has
a
meaning
and
chief
justice
shall
preside
has
a
meaning,
oath
or
affirmation
has
a
meaning,
but
trial
has
no
meaning
whatever.
i
agree
it
doesn't
have
a
precise
meaning,
but
it
has
some
meaning.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
margins.
everybody
will
agree
that
a
certain
thing
is
not
a
trial.
we
refuse
to
hear
any
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
may
agree
with
that,
but
i
would
say
the
same
about
the
chief
justice
presiding,
about
the
two-thirds,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
just
don't
see
any
logical
basis
for
drawing
a
line
between
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stewart,
i
suppose
after
these
arguments
are
over
the
nine
of
us
could
go
in
the
back
room
and
just
flip
a
coin
or
draw
straws
as
to
how
the
decision
should
come
out
and
it
would
be
promulgated.
that
would
be
wrong.
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
who
would
reverse
us
for
that?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
not
reversible.
so
it
is
theoretically
possible
that
a
branch
of
government
may
do
something
that
is
wrong,
that
is
even
unconstitutional,
but
that
just
can't
be
reversed.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
they
can't
draw
straws
or
flip
a
coin,
but
we
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
is
somebody
has
to
be
trusted
as
the
last
word,
isn't
that
the
simple
issue?
is
it
going
to
be
this
court,
which
may
flip
a
coin...
we
can
act
unconstitutionally,
just
as
the
senate
can.
the
only
issue
is,
who
is
going
to
have
the
last
word
and
be
unreviewable,
and
you
say
it
must
be
us,
and
the
other
side
says
it
must
be
the
senate
in
impeachment.
