justice
david
h.
souter
you
rest
your
argument
on
the
assumption
that
the
meaning
of
the
word
trial
is
clear.
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
we
conclude
that
the
meaning
of
the
word
trial
in
this
context
is
ambiguous?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
but
if
we
should
disagree
with
you
about
the
clarity
of
meaning,
do
i
understand
you
correctly
to
concede
that
the
case
should...
and
we
conclude
that
the
word
is
ambiguous,
do
i
understand
you
correctly
to
concede
that
the
case
should
be
decided
just
as
it
would
be
as
if
we
were
dealing
with
an
issue
which
the
constitution
did
not
expressly
address
in
any
way?
in
other
words,
we
would
defer
by
a
conclusion
of
nonjusticiability
to
the
senate
to
make
the
determination
and
leave
it
where
it
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that's
the
least
of
your
concerns.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
is
this
part
of
your
argument,
that
the
issue
is
justiciable?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
those
procedures
that
you
refer
to
as
having
been
entrusted
to
the
senate
are
in
other
words
those
which
are
not
necessarily
implied
by
the
word
trial
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
we
took--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
what
if
we
disagreed
with
you
on
the
18th
century
sense
of
trial
which
was
incorporated
into
the
text?
what
if
we
concluded
that
in
fact
trial
did
require
the
actual
presence
of
the
finders
of
fact
during
the
reception
of
all
of
the
evidence
and
we
so
defined
the
word
try
in
the
impeachment
clause?
would
you
then
find...
would
you
then
concede
that
the
failure
to
follow
that
procedure
which
was
implied
by
the
very
notion
of
trial
was
judiciable?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
concede
that
we
would
have
a
judiciable...
the
courts
would
have
a
judiciable
controversy
here
if,
1)
we
concluded
as
a
matter
of
law
the
trial
implied
the
reception
of
evidence
directly
by
the
findings
of
fact?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
would
not
concede
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why,
then,
don't
you
say
the
same
thing
with
respect
to
the
interpretive
power
to
determine
what
is
a
two-third
majority?
is
it
the
difference
between
an
issue
of
law
and
an
issue
of
fact
that
leads
to
different
answers?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
i
just
short-circuit
this,
maybe
make
this
simpler--
justice
david
h.
souter
--than
i
started
out
to
make
it.
you
concede
that
if
the
senate
records
showed
that
there
was
less
than
a
two-thirds
majority,
that
there
would
in
fact
be
a
justiciable
issue
on
declaratory
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
do
you
concede
that
because
that
is
an
issue
of
fact
which
is
easily
resolved?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
why
do
you
concede
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
a
difference
in
emphasis,
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
if,
for
example...
if
i
varied
my
example
and
said
trial
not
only
means
the...
not
only
requires
the
presence
of
all
the
fact-finders
but
they
had
said
trial,
parenthesis,
at
which
of
course
all
members
of
the
senate
will
be
present,
end
paren,
you
would
find
there
had
not
been
such
a
commitment
to
the
senate
simply
by
virtue
of
the
emphasis
on
that
requirement
and
the
need
to
enforce
it
somehow
beyond
the
senate
itself.
