justice
byron
r.
white
--i
suppose
when
you
call
it
a
trial
before
12
senators.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
the
case
is
all
about,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
really
are
suggesting
we
treat
this
case
as
though
there
hadn't
been
any
trial
at
all
in
terms
of
judiciability.
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
say
the
senate
would
have
the
power
just
to
impeach
based
on
a
criminal
conviction.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
at
least
what
the
senate...
the
procedure
the
senate
might
adopt,
i
suppose
they
would
have
to
call
it
a
trial,
wouldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whatever
it
meant,
they
have
to
be
able
to...
they
have
to
fit
it
within
the
word
try.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
senate
has
a
rule...
had
a
rule
that
anyone
who's
been
convicted,
any
federal
officer
who's
been
convicted
of
a
felony,
and
the
judgment
is
final,
we
just
automatically...
he
is
automatically
guilty.
all
it
needs
is
to
have
the
court
record
before
it,
and
the
show
is
all
over.
is
that
trying?
i
suppose
it
is
to
you,
as
far
as
you're
concerned.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
they
did
that,
that
in
your
view
would
be
judicially
reviewable.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--jurisdictional?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
it
would
be
proper
to
say,
well
we
assume
judiciability
without
deciding
it,
but
we
think
the
senate
clearly
had
the
power
to
do
what
it
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
house
could
impeach
saying
the
judge
is
a
bad
guy
and
the
senate
could
take
a
vote
without
any
trial
or
anything
else
and
say...
they
unanimously
say
the
judge
is
a
bad
guy.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
