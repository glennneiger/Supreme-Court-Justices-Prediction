counsel,
in
your
earlier
discussions
with
justice
stevens
you
indicated
that
communists
would
be
able
to
give
their
perspective
on
family.
i...
i
assume
from
that
that
atheists
would
be
able
to
give
theirs
under
your
rules.
justice
clarence
thomas
would
an
atheist
be
allowed
to
debate
a
minister
from
a
religious
perspective
under
your
rules?
justice
clarence
thomas
let's
just
say
it's...
the
debate
is
the
religious
value
versus
the
atheistic
value
or
content
of
a
family,
or
family
from
a
religious
or
atheistic
perspective.
justice
clarence
thomas
well
let's
say
it's
an
atheist
and
an
agnostic
debating
one
minister.
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
i'm
just
wondering
which...
what
is
it
about
the
debate
that
changes
when
you
add
a
minister
to
an
atheist
and
an
agnostic.
justice
clarence
thomas
well
how
could
that
be
proselytizing
if
it's
simply
two
debating
one.
let's
say
10
atheists
debating
one
minister
in
front
of--
justice
clarence
thomas
--an
atheist
audience.
justice
clarence
thomas
well,
i'm
trying
to
move
away
from
the
proselytizing
and
also
to
move
away
from
a
situation
in
which
the
minister
dominates
the
discussion.
justice
clarence
thomas
so
the
addition
of
the
minister
is
a
problem,
regardless
of
what
the
content
is
or
the
composition
is.
