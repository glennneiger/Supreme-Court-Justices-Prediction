mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
censorship
of
lamb's
chapel's
speech,
which
was
entertained
for
the
purpose
of
having
a
film
series
at
the
school
facilities
to
show
and
discuss
contemporary
family
issues.
the
direct
targeting
of
religious
purpose
as
an
exclusion
under
the
access
policy
of
the
school
district
is
both
content
based
and
viewpoint
based,
and
does
not
meet
constitutional
scrutiny.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
under...
well
first
of
all,
we
would
assert
that
it's
purely...
this
case
is
based
purely
on
religious
perspective,
it's
viewpoint
based.
most
recently,
r.a.v.,
but
also
under--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
first
amendment,
as
applied
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth,
freedom
of
speech.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
free
speech.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
well,
this
case
is
based
on
three
issues
when
it
was
originally
brought
fourth
in
the
complaint.
the
first
amendment's
freedom
of
speech
clause,
there
was
an
allegation
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
establishment
clause,
and
there
was
an
allegation
that
there
was
violation
of
free
exercise.
and,
quite
frankly,
the
nature
of
the
discrimination
that
takes
place
here
in
the
context
of
lamb's
chapel's
application
being
denied
violates
all
three.
from
the
first
amendment
perspective--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--the
court
of
appeals
came
to
the
conclusion
that
acknowledging
that
there
were
a
wide
diversity
of
uses,
which
the
respondents
have
conceded
as
well,
that,
in
fact,
because
there
were
no
prior
religious
uses,
the...
the
school
district
could
then
not
allow
lamb's
chapel
to
meet.
they
held,
in
fact,
that
it
was
a
close
question
whether
there
was
prior
religious
uses,
but
determined,
based
on
review
of
the
salvation
army
being
there,
the
southern
gospel
harmonizers,
that
it
was
no...
there
was
no
previous
religious
purpose
in
any
meaningful
way.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
the
respondents
have...
petitioners
have
conceded
your
honor,
justice
white,
that
yes,
the...
the
movie
series
was
dealing
with
contemporary
family
issues
from
a...
a
religious
perspective
and
are
quite
up
front
that
it
is
for
a
religious
purpose.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
our
concern
here,
and
i
think
what
is
evident
here,
is
that
the
viewpoint
discrimination
that
has
been
engaged
in
by
the
school
district
comes
from
their
own
admissions.
the
respondents
have
stated
that
the
decision...
and
i'm
quoting
from
their
brief.
"the
decision
to
exclude
petitioners
was
due
to
the
admittedly
religious
nature
of
the
film
and
the
school
district's
prohibition
against
the
use
of
school
property
for
religious
purposes.
"
they
then
state
that,
and
again
quoting,
"each
of
these
applications
were
denied
due
to
the
decidedly
religious
perspective
of
the
film.
"
if
lamb's
chapel
church
desired
to
utilize
school
facilities
during
noninstructional
time
in
the
evening,
pursuant
to
the
school's
access
policy,
and
if
they
determined
to
discuss
the
same
issues,
contemporary
family
issues,
with
the
sole
exception
being
that
they
do
not
make
religious
references
or
religious
perspectives,
then
center
moriches
could
not
object
to
allowing
the
group
to
be
there.
this
isn't
a
case
where
we
are
arguing
that
a
school
district
must
open
its
facilities
to
a
broad
array
of
uses.
here
the
school
district,
by
policy,
has
stated
that
they
are
opening
their
facilities
to
community
use
for
social,
civic,
recreational
purposes
and
other
uses
pertaining
to
the
welfare
of
the
community.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
they
actually
allow
political
speech,
however--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--the
rule
says
this,
that
political
speech
could
take
place,
political
meetings
could
take
place.
however
if,
in
fact,
the
political
meetings
were
partisan,
if
they
were
sponsored
by
a
political
organization,
then
there
would
have
to
be
a
vote
of
the
district
to
determine
whether,
in
fact,
that
group
could
meet,
which
i
think
presents
another
constitutional
issue
which
is
not
one
that
we're...
we're
concerned
with
today,
but
i
think
it
points
to
the
problem.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
political
speech
by
a
party
has
to
go
through
an
admission
process,
if
you
will.
so...
but
here,
and
i
think
what's
relevant
here
is
this
is
not
a
question
of
where,
justice
white,
they've
eliminated
or
construed
their
statute
to
remove
the
subject
matter
of
family
issues
from
the
permissible
speech.
this
is
not
a
question
of
whether
the
speech
topic
was
permissible,
nor
is
this
really
a
question
of
whether
the
group
was
entitled
to
access.
clearly
the
admission
policy,
the
use
policy
of
the
school
district
states
that
it
is
open
to
not-for-profit
outside
groups.
here
the
exclusion
was
based...
as
they
have
conceded,
based
on
its
content,
the
nature
of
the
film,
its
viewpoint,
its
perspective.
and
they've
allowed,
in
other
existing
uses,
several
discussions
on
family
issues.
for
instance--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes,
justice--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
certainly,
especially
in
the
context
of
the
policy
that
the
school
district
has
adopted
here.
the...
the
school
district
has
adopted
a
policy
which,
as
i
said,
opens
its
facilities
to
social,
civic,
recreational
use
and
other
uses
pertaining
to
the
welfare
of
the
community.
our
submission
is
quite
clear
that
we
believe
the
religious
perspective,
religious
discussions,
serve
civic,
social,
and
welfare
of
the
community
needs.
so--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i...
i
still
would
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
would
not...
could
not
justify
the
exclusion.
because
the
policy
here,
in
its
beginning,
opens
up
facilities
uses...
that's
again
for
social,
civic,
recreational
purposes.
i
think
the
religious
view
or
religious
perspective
on
social,
civic,
and
welfare
of
the
community
needs
is
relevant,
and
there's
no
basis
upon
which--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--unless,
of
course,
a
compelling
interest
could
be
shown.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
that
brings
up
a
different
question,
but
here
the...
the
free
exercise
issue
would
come
up
and
i
think
an
establishment
clause
issue
comes
up
in
the
context
of
our
case.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think
that
political--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--political
speech
is
appropriate
in
the
designation
that
the
school
district
has
adopted.
could
a
school
district
adopt
one
that
narrowly
tailors
and
says
no
political
speech
because
of
our
concerns?
maybe
they
could,
but
that's
not
what
they've
done
here.
and
i...
i
think
that
maybe--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
don't
think
that
you
can
say--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--a
prohibition--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--justice
kennedy,
if
there
was
a
prohibition
on
just
political
speech,
i
think
it
suffers
the
same
constitutional
defect.
it
has...
there
has
to
be
some
type
of
compelling
interest
here
to
justify
the
exclusion,
especially
when
the
subject
matter
is
a
valid
topic.
and
i...
i
would
also
point
out
here
that
there
were
discussions
of
civic
issues,
political
issues,
meet-the-candidates
nights.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
no...
no
i'm
not,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
no.
what
we're
saying
is
this.
the
school
district
here
has
adopted
a
policy
that
states
that
social,
civic,
recreational
uses
and
other
uses
pertaining
to
the
welfare
of
the
community
can
take
place.
they've
made
the
affirmative
determination
that,
in
fact,
those
type
of
activities
can
take
place.
a
school
district
certainly
can...
a
school
district
could
close
its
facilities.
they're
not...
they're
not
being
compelled
to
open
them--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
believe...
i
believe
it
does,
justice
scalia.
that's
what
i
was
saying
too--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--the
question
here
is
not
whether
political
speech
can
take
place,
because
under
the
policy
political
speech
can
take
place.
the
exclusion
is
if
it's
of
a...
from
a
partisan
organization,
and
i
think
that
suffers
from
constitutional
defects
as
well.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
under
the
policy
that's
been
adopted,
justice
souter,
that
removing
a
service,
religious
service,
would
suffer
the
same
constitutional
problems.
and
i
would
state
that
what
this
court
said
in
widmar
is...
is
relevant
to
that.
in
widmar
the
bible
group
meeting
of
cornerstone
was
in...
in
reality
a
service.
there
were
hymns,
there
was
singing,
there
were
discussions
on
biblical
commentary.
that
is
a
church
service
and
i
don't
think
that
a
school
district
that
decides
to
open
its
facilities...
as
i
said,
they
don't
have
to
open
their
racilities,
they've
decided
to
open
their
facilities...
can
then
parse
the
speech
so
closely
to
determine
when
religious
speech
crosses
the
line,
if
you
will,
to
a
religious
service.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
they
can
in
the
extent
of
speaker
identification,
clearly,
and
as
regard
to
the
subject
matter
of
the
discussion.
but
to
have
an
exclusion
on--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--not
when
the...
justice
souter,
not
when
the
policy
granting
access
says
social--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--not
in
the
context...
well,
if
it
was
just
a
flat...
there
were
no
outside
groups
for
other
purposes.
i
think
the...
the
hypothetical
that
you're
giving
depends
on...
and
i
don't
want
to
change
the
hypothetical--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i...
i
don't
think
that
would...
would
be
a
valid
exclusion.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
absolutely
not,
justice
souter.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
let
me
make...
let
me
make
the
position...
what
we're
saying
is
this.
the
school
district
here
has
elected
to
open
its
facilities
and
they've
conceded
to
a
wide
diversity
of
uses.
they
have
targeted
the
religious
purpose
speech
for
exclusion.
they
have
conceded
that
the
religious
exclusion
in
our
case
is
based
on
the
perspective
of
the
film
series
and
its
religious
nature,
that's
their
concessions.
once
you
have
an...
a
governmental
municipality
organization
opening
up
its
facilities
to
social,
civic,
recreational
uses
and
other
uses
pertaining
to
the
welfare
of
the
community,
they
cannot
then
close
it
because
of
a
religious
perspective.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
no.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
my
position
is...
this
is
my
position,
that
when
you
open
up
a
school
district...
when
a
school
district
elects
to
open
up
its
facilities
for
community
use
for
such
uses
as
social,
civic,
and
welfare
of
the
community
needs,
you
cannot
exclude
the
religious
perspective.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
no,
because
the
religious
perspective
is
relevant
to
civic
concerns.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
and
that's...
and
that's
where
the
viewpoint
discrimination
is
here.
and
i
think
the...
the
record
in
our
case
points
that
out
quite
clearly,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
no,
actually--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--precisely
what
they've
said
is
we
are
allowing
outside
not-for-profit
groups
to
utilize
school
facilities
due...
for
access
policy...
under
our
access
policy
for
social...
meetings
for
social,
civic,
recreational
purposes--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--and
other
uses
pertaining
to
the
welfare
of
the
community.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
yes.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
right.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
and
that's
precisely
our
point.
that
is
the
type
of
viewpoint
discrimination--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes,
they
have
targeted
religious
speech
for
exclusion
in
the
nature
of
the
entire--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--facilities
that
they've
opened
up.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that's--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--no.
but
that's
the
type
of
subject
matter
restrictions
that
a
school
district
in
this
type
of
situation
certainly...
they
could
say
just
for
bowling,
just
for
tennis.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
because
here
they
have
opened
up
the
facilities
intentionally
for
social,
civic,
and
welfare
of
the
community
needs.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
but
they've...
they
have...
that's
what
they
cannot
do,
however.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
because
this
court
has
said
that
viewpoint
discrimination,
even
in
a
nonpublic
forum,
is
not
acceptable.
and
i...
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i...
i
guess
the
argument
could
be
made
if
there's
a
religious
perspective
on
bowling.
but
when
you
open
up
the
topic
and
the
subject
matter
to
social,
civic,
and
welfare
of
the
concerns,
and
i
think
the
record
points
to
this.
the...
there's
two
things
that
i
think
are...
are
extremely
important
with
regard
to
the
record.
family
counseling
services,
which
was
an
organization
that
utilized
the
facilities
for
counseling,
dealt
with
the...
precisely
the
same
issues
that
the
school
district
would
have
dealt
with...
that
the
church
would
have
dealt
with
in
its
film
series.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i...
i
think
under
the
policy
that
they've
adopted,
they
cannot.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that's
correct.
and
that...
that
is,
i
think,
what...
what
i
was...
at
bottom,
is
what
this
case
is
about.
this
case--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
have
not,
we've
been
dealing
with
the
hypotheticals.
[laughter]
but
i
will
address...
i
will
address
the
widmar
issue.
but
let
me
say
first...
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question
and
then
i
will
proceed
to
answer
you,
justice
white.
this
is
a
case
where
the
identical
subject
matter,
family
issues,
child
abuse,
marital
conflict,
was
discussed
by
family
counseling
services
and
a
number
of
other
groups.
and
the
film
series,
if
lamb's
chapel
was
allowed
to
show
it,
addressed
the
same
issues,
albeit
from
a
religious
perspective.
and
that
is
what
is
prohibited
by
the
policy
and
that
is
the
viewpoint
discrimination
when
the
subject
matter
is
acceptable
and
the
speaker's
entitled
to
access,
that
this
court
has
said
that
type
of
viewpoint
discrimination--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--certainly,
justice
stevens.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
that,
in
that
case,
unless
the
school
district
could
show
a
compelling
interest
to
justify
the
exclusion,
they
would
have
the
same
problem.
and
i'm...
i'm
not
so
sure
they
would.
this
is
not
an
educational--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well,
that's...
that's
what
i
was
going
to
say.
and
the
compelling
interest
would
be--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--that's
a
different
hypothetical.
[laughter]
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
the
first...
the
second
hypothetical
is
different.
you're
talking
about
speech
that
is
not
advocating--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think
perhaps
a
school
district
would
then
have
to
assert
that
the
health
concerns...
and
now,
again,
this
is
another
situation
not
precisely...
or
really
very
remote
from
our
case...
but
where
maybe
the
school
district
could
come
up
with
some
compelling
interest
to
justify
medical
exclusion
based
on
that.
but
that's
not
what
happened
here,
and
this
is
not
a
case
where
they're
advocating
illegal
activity,
although
you
would
think
from
the
new
york
attorney
general's
perspective
that's
exactly
what's
going
here.
they...
they
say
religious
advocacy
is
only
good
to
those
who
already
believe...
already
adherents
of
the
faith.
but
widmar
has
addressed
this
issue
precisely.
by
policy,
the
school
district...
the
university
in
widmar
encouraged
student
groups
and
stated
that
they
would
like...
they
encouraged
student
groups
to
meet
and
form
for
social,
civic,
political,
recreational,
and
educational
purposes.
here,
the
center
moriches
school
district
has
adopted
a
policy
and--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
don't
think
in
this
case--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--that's
correct.
and
the
school--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--correct.
different
case.
and--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--but
the
distinction,
and
i
think
the
distinction
cuts
our
way
here,
justice
white,
is
that
in
widmar
the
university
determined
to
open
its
school
district
up
for
student
groups
to
use
it.
here,
the
school
district
determined
to
open
up
its
school
facilities
for
outside
uses.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
so
i
think
the
speaker
identification
restrictions
in
widmar
and
what
was
adopted
here,
albeit
different,
cut
our
way.
because
what
we
have
is
a
school
district
affirmly
saying
community
groups,
come
in
and
use
our
facilities,
for
precisely
the
same
policy
in
scope
that
was
in
widmar.
the
exclusion
is
the
same
as
well.
in
widmar
the
exclusion
was
that
they
prohibited
school
district...
university
facilities
to
be
used
for
the
purposes
of
religious
worship
or
teaching.
here
the
exclusion
states
that
school
district
facilities
may
not,
or
school
premises
may
not
be
used
for
religious
purposes,
and
the
justification
for
the
exclusion
is
the
same
as
well.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
believe--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--that
case
is
not
different,
and
i'll...
here's
the
reason.
my
statement
is
if
the
topic...
if
the
preamble
to
the
use
application
is
for
social,
civic,
recreational
purposes
and
other
uses
pertaining
to
the
welfare
of
the
community,
a
religious
or
religion
has
value,
in
my
client's
perspective
and
others,
to
civic
affairs.
that
is
where
i
think
the...
that's
not
saying
that
a
school
district
can--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think
politics,
political
speech,
has
relevant
application
to
social
and
civic
issues.
i
don't
think
a
school
district
can
say
that.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that
would--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--not
without
justifying
it
by--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes,
justice
scalia,
they
can
exclude...
they
could
close
the
forum
down.
they
could
say
just
bowling.
but
they
can't
open
it
up
to
social,
civic--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--and
recreational
use
and
say
no
to
religion
or
religious
perspective.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
no
to
politics,
albeit
a
different
case.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
they
did,
in
this
case.
the...
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
candidates
where
they
each
gave
their
proposal.
and
i
think
that
points
out
what's...
what's
taken
place
here.
this
isn't
a
problem
where
a
political
group
is
having
trouble
getting
access;
they
have
had
access.
the
problem
is--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes,
justice--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
a
difficult
policy
for
the
school
district
to
write,
justice
kennedy.
a
school
district
could
write
a
policy,
and
i
don't
want
to
be
in
the
place
of
writing
their
policies
but
can
write
a
policy
limiting
the
subject
matter
and
limiting
the
speaker
identity
and
still
have
other
groups
participate.
but
once
you
open
it
up
to
social,
civic...
this
isn't
just
social,
civic,
and
recreational
use.
they
also
have
in
their--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--yes.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
yes.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think...
i'm
not...
shouldn't
be
in
the
position
of
drafting
the
regulations,
but
i
would
be
quite
forthright
in
saying
we've
thought
about
that
issue
and
i
think
a...
a
policy
could
be
drafted
which
states
that
school
facilities
will
be
used
for
recreation.
school
facilities
will
be
used
for
the
student
groups
to
discuss
student
issues.
you
don't
have
to
open
it
up,
but
when
you
start
opening
it
up
to
social,
civic,
and
other
uses
pertaining
to
the
welfare
of
the
community--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--absolutely.
and
it's
not...
it's
not
a--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--absolutely.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
no.
i
don't
think--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--in
the
context--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well
here's...
here's...
let
me
make...
put
it
in
at
it's
bottom.
by
policy
and
practice
the
school
district
has
determined
to
open
its
facilities
to
these
various
uses,
the
social,
civic,
and
welfare
of
the
community.
having
done
that--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--that's
right.
but
having
done
that,
they
cannot
exclude
it
as
to
religion.
and
i
think...
and
the
reason
is
this
court
has
said--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--well
i
don't
think
if...
let
me
take
your
theater
hypothetical.
if
they
let
in
theater
groups
to
perform
issues,
but
then
say
no
to
handel's
messiah...
which
this
school
district,
by
the
way,
allowed
handel's
messiah
but
they
found
that
not
to
be
religious
in
a
meaningful
way...
i
don't
think
they
can
do
that.
but
could
a
school
district
say
we're
going
to
open
our
facilities
to
drama
groups--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--for
the
presentation
of
shakespeare,
yes.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
but
not
have--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--under
that
policy,
yes.
i
don't
think
that's
under--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
don't--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
would
have
to
concede,
which
i'm
not
going
to,
that
a
mass
would
be
irrelevant
to
the
community
good
or
community
welfare
or
civic,
social
concerns.
they
could
draft
a
policy
to
prohibit
masses.
they
could
draft
a
policy
to
prohibit
this
film
series
from
showing,
but--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
would
not--
[laughter]
i
will...
i
said
i
will
not
concede
it
because...
i'll
make
that
very
clear,
i
believe,
and
our
perspective
that
we're
taking
here
is
that
when
you
open
it
up
to
social,
civic,
and
recreational
uses
and
other
welfare
of
the
community,
that
a
mass
would
serve
the
community.
that
doesn't
mean
everyone
has
to
go
to
the
mass.
this
isn't
a
captive
audience.
this
isn't
a
situation
where
students
are
there,
during
the
day.
and
i
think
this...
what
this
court
said
in
mergens
is...
is
relevant
to
that.
if
a...
if
high
school
students
were
mature
enough
to
understand
that
a
school
district
does
not
endorse
everything
it
fails
to
censor,
i
think
the
adults
in
the
community
of
center
moriches
could
do
the
same.
and
i
don't
think
it
presents
the
type
of
constitutional
dilemma
that...
that
some
have
made
it
out
to
be,
that
we'll
have
to
allow
all
religious
services.
if
allowing
the
religious
service
is
going
to
be
so
divisive
to
the
community
that
they
now
can
justify
the
exclusion
under
this
policy,
no
they
can't.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
that
is
correct.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
absolutely.
this
ordinance,
although
maybe
not
suffering
the
same
constitutional
defect
that
the
board
of
airport
commissioners
were,
wher
it
was,
you
know,
no
first
amendment
activities
in
here,
suffers
from
that
same
type
of
problem.
they
have
not
chosen
to
narrowly
tailor
their
restrictions.
instead,
what
they've
done
is
open
it
up
t
social,
civic,
recreational,
and
other
uses
pertaining
to
the
welfare
of
the
community,
but
say
no
if
it's
a
religious
perspective,
no
if
it's
religious
content.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
think
they
could
limit
it
to
shakespeare
if
they
had
a...
a
standard
which
was
specifi
saying
we're
going
to
have
shakespeare.
but
they
cannot
say
we're
going
to
allow
drama
groups
and
they
exclude
handel's
messiah
because
we
do
not
want
a
religious
group
or
discriminate
against
a
religious
play
if
it
was
opened
up
to...
to
drama
generally.
and
that's
what
the
difference
is.
they've
not
chosen
to
limit
to
specifics.
they've
been...
they've
chosen
to
open
it
to
everything
but
religion.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
once
they've
made
that...
once
they've
said
we're
going
to
allow
our
facilities
to
be
used
for
dramatic
productions,
you
cannot
say,
now,
no
to--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--that's
a
different...
different
question,
because
that...
and
here's
the
difference.
in
the
drama
context,
if
they
open
up
the
drama,
open
it
up
to
dramatic
use,
okay,
they
can
then
not
say
no
to
the
religion.
if
it's
an
x-rated
movie
shown
for,
for
instance,
for
profit,
they've
already
said
that
speaker
identity
won't
take
place
then.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
but
if
they
don't
like
the
movie.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
okay.
well,
if
they're
saying
an
x-rated
movie's
going
to
be
shown
at
the
school
district
facilities,
this...
the
analysis
i
don't
think
changes
constitutionally.
again,
i
think
that
in...
in
a
real
sense,
a
town...
this
is
the
meeting
hall,
the
town
hall
that
was
discussed...
mentioned
in
lemon.
and
i
think
that
the
interesting
issue
and
the
important
issue
here
at
bottom
is
not
that
school
districts
have
to
open
its
facilities
up,
not
that
they
can't
narrowly
tailor
them,
but
once
they've
opened
them
up
to
such
a
broad
array
of
topics,
they
cannot
exclude
religious
speech
or
religious
purpose
speech,
as
they
have
determined.
and
here
that's
exactly
what
they've
done
and
that
type
of
viewpoint
discrimination
this
court
should
not
tolerate.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
way
i
understand
the
respondents'
argument,
the
atheists
are
in,
the
agnostics
are
in,
the
communists
are
in,
the
religion
is
not
in.
in
fact,
even
if
it
was
a
debatable
point,
as
justice
thomas
just
said,
only
one
side
of
the
debate
is
heard.
that's
exactly
what
we've
been
asserting
in
our
briefs
and
that's
exactly
what
they've
conceded
in
their
briefs.
this
is
the
type
of
viewpoint
discrimination
that
this
court
has
not
sanctioned.
and
i'd
also
point
out
that
this
establishment
clause
concern
has
already
been
addressed.
this
case
is
not
in
a
vacuum.
widmar
is
this
court's
precedent,
mergens
is
this
court's
precedent.
we're
talking
about
a
policy
of
equal
access,
and
if
the
communists
can
come
in
and
give
their
view
on
family
life
and
others
could
give
their
view
on
family
life,
but
you
allow
religion...
i
think
if
there's
an
establishment
clause,
it...
it
violates...
their
policy
violates
the
establishment
clause
by
interfering
with
religion.
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
in
the
context,
justice
white,
of
this
existing
policy?
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
i
think
it's
the
same
argument,
because
a
religious
service
does
have
a
religious
perspective,
especially
if
the
sermon
is
addressing
the
family
issues
that
were...
that...
in
the
debate,
so
to
speak.
you
had
the
secularist
groups
come
in
and
give
their
view
and
then
you
had
a
religious
service,
they
sang
religious
songs,
they
gave
hymns,
and
then
the
sermon
was
family
values
and
family
issues
from
the
bible.
to
deny
that
is
viewpoint
discrimination,
to
make...
to
make
no
constitutional--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i--
mr.
jay
a.
sekulow
--i
believe
in
that
case
the...
the
biblical
admonition,
whatever
it
might
be,
is
still
a
religious
perspective
and
probably,
based
on
views
of
the
bible
that
people
hold,
would
be
valid
as
to
civic,
social,
and
recreational
use.
the
policy
here
is
not
different
than
widmar.
widmar
limited
it
to
student
groups,
the
school
district
opened
it
to
outside
groups.
they've...
the
speaker
identity
is
not
an
issue
and
the
subject
matter's
not
an
issue.
there
is
one
thing
that
is
an
issue.
the
communists
are
in,
the
atheists
are
in,
the
agnostics
are
in,
but
religion's
out
because
we
don't
like
their
viewpoint
and
that's
what
we're
objecting
to
here.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
