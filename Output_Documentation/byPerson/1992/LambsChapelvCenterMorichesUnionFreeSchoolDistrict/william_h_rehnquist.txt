chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
91-2024,
lamb's
chapel
and
john
stig...
steigerwald
v.
center
moriches
union
free
school
district.
mr.
sekulow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
if
the
school
district
had
adopted
a
policy
of
excluding
both
religious
and
political
speech
on
the
grounds
these
tend
to
cause
controversy
and
arguments
and
we'd
just
rather
stay
away
from
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--could...
could...
could
the
state
exclude
only
partisan
political
speech
and
say
that
we
just
don't
want
to
get
into
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well...
well
then
you're
saying
that
if
a
school
district
opens
up
its
forum
to
any
outsiders,
it's
got
to...
up...
open
it
up
across
the
board.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
it
seems
to
me
that's
what
you're
saying.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't...
you
don't
have
to
defend
some
of
these
rather
extreme
hypotheticals
to
win
your
case.
your
position,
i
take
it,
is
that
since
they
have
had
family
rearing
matters
shown
and
discussed,
they
can't
exclude
a
family
rearing
presentation
because
of
a
religious
perspective
in
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
you
would
have
to
concede
it,
but
you're
not
going
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sekulow.
mr.
hoefling,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
policy
of
the
district
was
it
that
paster
steigerwald
said
he
couldn't
or
wouldn't
abide?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
have...
i
mean
just
state
it
generally.
you
don't
have
to
read
it
word
for
word.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
meant
any
sort
of
a
presentation
that
had
a
religious
connotation
to
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
would
the
policy
permit
someone
to
come
in
and
urge
the
adoption
of
a
particular
lifestyle
that
was
not
based
on
any
religious
precepts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
would
allow
lifestyle
presentations,
lifestyle
proselytizing,
so
to...
so
to
speak,
of
a
secular
nature,
secularly
inspired
but
not
religiously
inspired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that's
consistent
with
our
opinion
in
widmar?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
is
that
you
have
an
open
forum
except
for
any
religious
viewpoint.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
it...
it
is...
it
isn't...
i
mean
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
a
speaker
could
come
in
and
urge
the
adaptation
of
a
particular
lifestyle
so
long
as
he
was
urging
it
on
a
secular
basis,
but
that
he...
so
that
that
subject
matter
is
permissible.
but
a
speaker
who
urges
the
adoption
of
a
lifestyle
based
on
a
religious
theme
or
a
religious
passage
could
not
do
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice
scalia
gave
you
a
hypothetical
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
ought
to
try
to
answer
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
like
saying
that
a
ban
on
left
wingers
is
neutral
because
it
includes
both
communists
and
socialists.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hoefling.
mr.
sekulow,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sekulow.
the
case
is
submitted.
