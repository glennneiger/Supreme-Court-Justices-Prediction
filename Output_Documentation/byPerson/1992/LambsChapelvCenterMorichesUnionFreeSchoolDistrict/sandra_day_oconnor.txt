if...
if
the
university
in
the
widmar
case
had
adopted
the
same
policy
as
your
school
district,
do
you
think
the
result
in
the
case
would
have
been
different?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me.
the
question
i
asked
you,
though,
was
whether
if
the
university
there
had
adopted
the
same
policy
you've
adopted,
whether
the
result
in
the
case
would
have
been
the
same?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why...
why
is
that,
because
it's
a
university
and
this
is
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
distinguishing
mark,
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
some
of
our
cases
talking
about
public
forum,
i
think
you
find
an
indication
that
the
court
has
said
that
reasonable
and
neutral
limitations
can
be
imposed.
do
you
assert
that
the
limitation
here
on
religious
content
is
reasonable
and
neutral?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
a
little
hard
to
propose.
i'd
like
you
to
explain
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
people
with
an
antireligious
viewpoint
are,
and
so
you
think
that's
neutral.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
did
with
justice
stevens
a
few
minutes
ago
and
i
understood
you
to
confirm
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
say
that's
neutral.
