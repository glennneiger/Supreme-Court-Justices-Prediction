justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
give
you
one
other
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
there's
a
group
that
thinks
families
would
be
much
healthier
and
happier
and
get
along
better
if
they
all
smoked
marijuana
together,
and
they
came
and
they
want
to
advocate
that
under
the
subject
matter
of
child
rearing
and
family
values.
would
they
have
to
give
that
group
access
to
the
facilities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
law
should
be
changed
in
order
to
accommodate
this
family
value.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
the
one
i
had
in
mind
all
along.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
say...
or
just
say
family
value
would
be
promoted
by
soak...
by
having
the
children
learn
how
to
smoke
cigarettes
at
an
early
age.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
make
sure
i
understood
on
of
your
statements.
you
mentioned
shakespeare
if
they
opened
up
for
drama.
did
you
say
yes
or
no
to
the
question
of
whether
they
could
limit
it
to
shakespeare?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
do
open
it
up
to...
if
they
open
it
up
to
drama
generally,
they
can't
be
concerned
about
whether
it's
just
adult
drama
or
teenage
drama
or
any
kind
of
drama,
it's
just
open
generally.
justice
john
paul
stevens
x-rated
movies
are
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
disagree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--throw
in
the
for
profit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
i
understand
your
statement
you
made
earlier
that
supposing
you
had
a
communist
group
that
wanted
to
address
the
subject
of
family
values
and
they
thought
there
was
a
value
in
not
having
children
waste
their
time
going
to
sunday
school
or
church
and
therefore
they
had
a
point
of
view
that
was
definitely
antireligious,
they
would
be
permitted,
under
your
policy,
to
discuss
family
values
in
that
context?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
now
why
is
that
not...
the
contrast
between
that
and
what
you
have
here,
why
is
that
not
viewpoint
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
my...
my
communist
example,
why
couldn't
one
make
the
argument
that
they
are
trying
to
proselytize
a
nonreligious
point
of
view.
and
you're,
in
effect,
discriminating
against
religions
as
opposed
to
those
who
are
totally
against
religion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your...
your...
your...
do
i
understand
your
entanglement
argument
correctly
that
what
you're
saying
is
if
we
let
this
particular
religious
point
of
view
be
expressed,
well
the
next
step
will
be
the
mass
and
the
ceremony.
you're
going
to
have
to
draw
a
line
somewhere
which
will
involve
entanglement
in
religious
decision
making,
in
effect.
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
i
don't
have
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
there's
any...
there's
not
at
issue
here
any
right
to
use
the
school
facilities
to
advertise
the
fact
that
there's
going
to
be
the
program,
is
there?
did
they
drum
up
their
customers
or
their
attendees
independently
of
the...
of
the
school?
