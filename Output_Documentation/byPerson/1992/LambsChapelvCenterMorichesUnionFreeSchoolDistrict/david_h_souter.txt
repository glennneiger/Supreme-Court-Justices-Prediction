h.

mr....
mr.
sekulow--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
would...
on
your
view,
you
would
also
be
entitled
to
win,
wouldn't
you,
if
we
don't
accept
your
characterization
of
it
as
viewpoint
based,
but
held
it
to
be
content
based.
on
your
theory,
you'd
still
win,
wouldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
if
we
said
what
was
excluded
was
simply
discussions
of
religion
or
religious
proselytization,
you
would
still,
on
your
viewpoint,
win.
justice
david
h.
souter
also,
by
the
same
token
would
you
say
that
if
they...
they
could
not
exclude
a...
a
religious
service,
for
example.
if
an
outside
group
wanted
to...
to
celebrate
a
mass
or
a
baptism
or
something
like
that,
could
the...
i
presume,
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
that
could
not
be
excluded.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
are...
are
you
accepting
the...
the
ultimate
premise
of
the
other
side
that
they
can,
in
fact,
define
the
extent
to
which
they
open
it
up?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
answer
is
there...
quite
clearly,
they
could
exclude
all
political
speech
and
they
could
exclude
all
religious
speech.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
no.
but
you
were...
you're
just
changing
the
premise
of
my
question.
my...
the
premise
of
my
question
was
that
their
policy
granting
access
says
no
religious
speech,
no
political
speech.
on
your
view,
that
would
be
permissible.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
there
would
be
outside
groups
for
other
purposes,
there
just
wouldn't
be
outside
groups
for
political
purposes
and
religious
purposes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
not?
i
thought
your
argument
was
proceeding
on
the
fact
that
they've
opened
the
doors
wide
and
they
cannot
then
pick
and
choose
within
the
extent
to
which
they
have
opened
them.
but
that
apparently
isn't
your
argument
and
you're
now
saying
they've
got
to
open
the
doors
wide.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
how
do
we
draw
the
line?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
a
narrow
categorization
is
possible,
and
i
think
you're
also
saying
that
if
a...
if
a
general
categorization,
including
speech
generally
is
allowed,
there
cannot
be
a
specific
exception
to
it
for
subject
matter.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it...
it
simply
boils
down
to
a
question
of
the
precision
with
which
they
specifically
identify
the
permitted
uses.
justice
david
h.
souter
you...
you
seem
to
be
making--
justice
david
h.
souter
--two...
coming
up
with
two
categories
that
you
think
are
important.
one
is
a
category
of
university
forums,
is
that
correct,
that
makes
a
different
and
that's
your...
basically,
your
answer
to
justice
white's
question,
i
guess?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
a...
it's
necessarily
a
subset
of...
of...
of
what,
a
designated
public
forum?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's...
is
it
a...
maybe
i'm
just
getting
mixed
up
in
definitions,
but
are
you
saying
it's
a
designated
public
forum
which
is
necessarily
open?
once
you
open
a
university,
you
have...
so
far
as
the
students
are
concerned,
you
necessarily
have
a
public
forum
for
the
students?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know
that's
what
you're
saying,
but
my
question
is
is
that
a
necessary
conclusion
that
follows
from
your
view
of
what
a
university
is
for
first
amendment
purposes?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
now,
do
you...
are
you
also
suggesting
that
in
order
to
win,
we
recognize...
we
must
recognize
in
this
case
a...
a
fourth
forum
category,
that
is
the...
the
limited
designated
public
forum?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
you're...
you're
saying
a...
a
designated
public
forum
can
have
limitations,
but
it
cannot
in
a
university
setting
with
respect
to
university
students,
considered
in
isolation.
