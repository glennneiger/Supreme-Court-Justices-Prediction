justice
byron
r.
white
--so
what...
what
provision
of
the
constitution
are
you
relying
on?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
part
of
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
free
speech.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the...
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
decide?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
do
we
judge
it
on
the
basis
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
that...
that
this
program
had
a
religious
purpose?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
political
speech?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
the...
what
does
the
rule
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
religious
speech
is
not
the
only
speech
that
is
at
least
presumptively
barred.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the...
how
about
the...
how
about
the
political
question--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
were
just
asked?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
didn't
answer,
yeah.
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
still
haven't
answered
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't...
isn't...
aren't
you
i
would
think
you
would
argue
that
we've
already
decided
this
case.
in
widmar.
justice
byron
r.
white
--we
have
argued
that
this
court's
decision
in
widmar
has
decided
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you've
hardly
mentioned
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
fact
is
it
would
be
against
the
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
widmar...
in
widmar,
the
group,
the
religious
group
that
wanted
to
meet
was
a
student
group.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
a
student
group
in
widmar.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
i
would...
i
would
suppose
that...
i
would
suppose
that
if
the
school
in
this
case
had
opened
its...
had
opened
its
property
just
for
student
activities
dealing
with
social
and
such,
but
no
outside
groups
whatsoever,
you
probably
wouldn't
be
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
yeah,
but
that...
but
that
happens
to
be
widmar.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
all
candidates
for
office
would
be
entitled
to
use
the
schoolhouse
to...
to
make
their
speeches
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
university
in
widmar
had--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
if
the
university
in
widmar
had
adopted
exactly
the
same
rule?
it
didn't
limit
access
to
the
university
grounds
to
students
or
student
activities,
it
said
the
university
facilities
are
open
to
all
groups
for
social,
welfare
organizations,
et
cetera.
it
had
exactly
the...
had
exactly
your
rule
but
just
excluded
the
political
speech
and
religious
speech.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
there...
wouldn't
widmar
have
come
out
differently?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
no,
no.
the
same
church...
the
same
church
wanted
to
come
in
and
do
what...
what
the
church
in
this
case
wanted
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
the
community
nonstudent
group
and
there
had
been
hundreds
of
other
nonstudent
groups
allowed
on
the
university
campus,
would
widmar
have
come
out
differently?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
seems--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
me
your
entanglement
argument
is...
doesn't
carry
much
with
me
because
you...
because
in
order
to
exclude
under
your
no
religion
rule,
you've
got
to
decide
whether
this...
whether
this
is
going
to
be
religion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that
may
be
so
in
this
case,
but
you...
you're...
you're
bound
to
have
to
decide
whether...
some
group
that
is
going
to
come
in
with
some
program,
whether
in
fact
it's
a
religious
program.
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
and...
and
that
is
the...
so
you're
never
going
to
avoid
your
entanglement
problem.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think...
that
all...
that
the
only
exclusion
with
respect
to
religion
was
religious
ceremonies,
actually
religious
services?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it
wasn't
a
sermon
about
family
values?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
was
a...
what
if
the...
what
if
the
only
thing
that
happened
was
that
they
read
from
the
bible,
they
read
from
the
scriptures?
