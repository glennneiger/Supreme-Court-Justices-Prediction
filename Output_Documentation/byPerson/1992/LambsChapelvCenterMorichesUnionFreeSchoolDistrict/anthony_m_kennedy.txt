well,
but
what's
the
difference.
it...
it
seems
to
me--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
you
haven't
answered
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
talk
about
free
exercise.
we're
talking
about...
just
about
speech.
if
there
is
a...
a
prohibition
against
political
speech,
is
that
valid?
and
if
not,
how
is
that
different
from
the
case
we
have
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
question
you've
been
asked.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
sekulow.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
sekulow,
if
i
were
an
attorney
for
a
school
board
and
was
listening
to
your
argument,
i
would
go
back
to
my
board
of
education
and
say
if
you
open
your
auditorium
to
two
or
three
different
lectures
in
the
community,
based
on
the
argument
i
heard
from
mr.
sekulow,
you're
going
to
have
to
allow
a
catholic
mass
to
be
said
in
that
facility.
because
i've
heard
him
say
nothing
that
would
allow
the
court
to
write
a
decision
that
gives
any
kind
of
reasonable
assurance
that
we
can
design
a
category
to
prevent
this
use
once
we
have
two
or
three
different
lecture
groups
come
in
from
the
community
at
large.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
your
first
amendment
submission,
which
is
that
there
must
be
absolute
content
neutrality--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
viewpoint
neutrality.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i...
i
contest
that
you
could...
could...
could
accomplish
the
objective
that
you've
just
outlined.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
difference
between
speech
with
a
religious
viewpoint
and
a
religious
exercise?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
constitution
itself
talks
about
free
exercise,
so
might
not
that
be
a
workable
category?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
problem
is...
is
that
if
you
define
religion...
a
limited
forum
in
terms
of
content,
it
can
be
self-defeating
because
the
whole
idea
of
limited...
of...
of
a
public
forum
of
some
kind
is
to
allow
for
the
expression
of
speech,
so
you
have
to
be
very
careful
that
you're
not
just
engaging
in
a
circular
definition.
