justice
antonin
scalia
but
doesn't...
doesn't
political
speech
fall
under
that
category,
that...
that...
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--hum.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
your...
is
your
theory,
mr.
sekulow,
that
you
cannot
pick
on
religion,
that...
that...
that
if
religion
is
just
one
of
many
things
excluded
it's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
it's
the
only
thing
excluded
or
one
of
only
a
couple
of
things
excluded,
it's
not
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
because
that
includes
too
many
needs.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
they
haven't...
but
they
haven't
said
civic
concerns.
they've
said
civic
concerns
except
religious
concerns.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
heaven's
not
there
and
they've
said
except--
justice
antonin
scalia
--religious.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
why?
because
they've
singled
out
religious--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but...
but
you
would
not
mind
if
they
singled
out
religious...
religion
for
exclusion
along
with
a
lot
of
other
things.
that
if...
that
is
they
said
we
are
going
to...
we
are
going
to
have...
we
are
going
to
allow
bowling.
justice
antonin
scalia
nothing
else.
we're
not
going
to
allow
religion,
we're
not
going
to
allow
politics,
we're
not
going
to
allow
other
socially
good
things,
you
wouldn't
have
an
objection
then,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
is
that...
why
is
that
okay
and
this
one
not
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
they
haven't.
they've
said
social,
civic,
and
welfare
except
religious.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
know
you
say
they
cannot
do
it.
why
can
they
not
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you've
just
said
viewpoint
discrimination
is
acceptable
if
they
say
we're
going
to
have
bowling
but
we're
not
going
to
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
also
said
that
they
could
not
exclude
religious
services,
didn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sekulow.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
on
that
narrow
basis,
you
know,
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
relatively
limited.
you're
saying
if...
if
you...
if
you
allow
the
discussion
of
a
certain
topic
you
cannot
permit
a
religious
viewpoint
on
that
topic.
but
the
next
case
just
around
the
corner
is...
is
a
group
that
wants
to
come
into
this
same...
the
same
school
district
and
they
say
we
want
to
address
the...
the
topic
of
religion,
not...
not
family,
we
want
to
address
separately
the
topic
of
religion.
and
it's
not
a
question
of
giving
a
religious
viewpoint
on
some
other
topic
which...
which
the
rules
allow,
but
rather
the
topic
of
religion
in
and
of
itself
which
is
as
a
separate
topic--
justice
antonin
scalia
--now.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
it
say
civic,
social,
and...
and
recreational
purposes
other
than
politics?
can
it
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it
does,
but
the
school
says
it's
just
too
controversial--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
therefore
we're
going
to
exclude
that
from
our
otherwise
all-inclusive
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can't
exclude
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
question
of
how
broad
the
other
uses
are
then,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so
let
me
come
back
to
the
question
i
asked
before
but
which
you...
you...
you
would
not
answer.
if
you...
if
you
exclude
religion
when
you're
letting
in
virtually
everything
else
that
seems
to
be
a
problem
to
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you're
excluding
religion
when
you're
excluding
a
lot
of
other
stuff,
that
does
not
seem
to
be
a
problem.
is
that
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then
what
is
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
i
don't
understand
what
the
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--except
religion.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
they
only...
if
they
only
let
in
recreation
and
theater,
then
they
can
exclude
religion.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
why
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
they
could
say...
but
they
could
say
no
mass.
the
could
say
no
mass.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
but
under
this
current
policy
you
say
they
can't
even
say
no
mass.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
entanglement.
justice
antonin
scalia
entanglement
problems?
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
the...
the
janitor
who's
going
to
be
in
the
building.
i
don't
understand
who
gets
entangled.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
school
districts
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
do
it
in
virginia.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
not
according
to
you.
there's
establishment
problems.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i'm...
i'm
not
talking
about
a
constitutional
requirement.
i'm
talking...
you
were
talking
about
a
constitutional
prohibition.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
there's
an
establishment
problem
in
doing
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
these
virginia
districts
that
do
it,
and
for
all
i
know...
i
live
in
virginia
so
i
know
that
it's
there,
it
may
well
be
in
other
states,
you
say
that...
that's
a
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
uh-hum.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
assume
a
school
district
that
leases
its...
its...
its
facilities
for
any
purpose
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
commercial,
political,
anything
at
all.
they...
they
must,
however,
not
allow
a
church
group
that
wants
to
lease
it
of
a
sunday
to
conduct
a
service
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
constitution
requires
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
exclude...
could
you
exclude
communists
from
conducting
any...
any
family
movies?
you
could
say
except
those
that...
that
have
a
communist
or
socialist
viewpoint.
justice
antonin
scalia
limited
public
forum,
no
communist
or
socialist
viewpoints,
is
that
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
i
see.
you...
you
defend...
that's
the
defense
of
your
statute,
then,
that
the
establishment
clause
makes
you
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then...
then
don't
make
that
argument
then.
wherein
does
the
example
that
i
gave
you
differ?
if
you
are
not
relying
on
the
establishment
clause
to
say
that
you
cannot
do
this,
then
why
is
it
different
to
exclude
a
religious
viewpoint
than
to
exclude
a
socialist
or
communist
viewpoint
in...
in
these
movies?
why
can't
i
have
a
limited
public
forum,
movies
on
anything
you
like
but
no
socialists
or
communists?
justice
antonin
scalia
uh-hum.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right?
just...
just
that
type
of
political
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
very
interesting.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
lawful
because
it
is.
it
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--therefore
it
is
lawful.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hoefling--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this...
this
may
be
a
little
unfair
because
it's
really
not
brief,
but
you...
you
are
here
representing
both
respondents,
i...
i
gather,
in
this
argument,
and
the
attorney
general
of
new
york,
in
his
brief
defending
the...
the
new
york
rule
says
that...
i'm
quoting,
"religious
advocacy
serves
the
community
only
in
the
eyes
of
its
adherents
and
yields
a
benefit
only
to
those
who
already
believe.
"
does
new
york
state...
i
grew
up
in
new
york
state
and
in
those
days
they...
they
used
to
have
a
tax
exemption
for
religious
property.
is
that
still
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they've
changed
their
view,
apparently,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
see...
it
used
to
be
thought
that...
that
religion...
it
didn't
matter
what
religion,
but
it...
some
code
of
morality
always
went
with
it
and
it
was
thought
that,
you
know,
what
was
called
a
god-fearing
person
might
be
less
likely
to
mug
me
and
rape
my
sister.
that
apparently
is
not
the
view
of
new
york
anymore.
justice
antonin
scalia
has
this
new
regime
worked
very
well?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
however,
there
may
be
some
compulsion
to
treat
it...
to
treat
religion
like
other
civic
goods.
and
when
you
open
up
the
forum
to
other
social
and
civically
beneficial
things,
you
cannot
exclude
it
to
religion
on
the
theory
that
religion,
after
all,
is
just
private
and
only
serves...
only
yields
a
benefit
to
those
who
already
believe.
that
certainly
hasn't
been
our...
our
tradition
in...
in
this
country
in
viewing
the
role
of
religion
in
public
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
i
don't--
--counsel,
just--
--i
don't
really
understand
what
the
entanglement
problems
are,
even
if
it
were
a
matter
of
allowing
religious
services.
let's
assume
that...
that
the...
that
the
school
district
leases
its
building...
it's
just
a
building.
it's
a
building
and
once
the
kids
are
out
and
it's
in
the
evening
and
they're
nothing...
it's
a
building
that
they
rent
out
to
anything.
let's
assume
they
rent
it
even
to
for-profit
organizations
for
conducting
sales
meetings,
training
of
sales
representatives,
or
whatever,
but
there
is
somehow
an...
an
entanglement
problem
if...
if
they
would
lease
it
to
a
religious
group
that
wants
to
conduct
a
service
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but...
but
you
allow...
you
allow,
you
know,
general
motors
or
whoever
commercial.
you
don't
inquire
into,
you
know,
do...
do
we
agree
with
all
the...
all
the
things
that
general
motors
does.
you
just
lease
it
out,
but
you
can't
do
that
for
religious
groups
somehow.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
suffer
that
special
disability,
that's
what
entanglement
means.
