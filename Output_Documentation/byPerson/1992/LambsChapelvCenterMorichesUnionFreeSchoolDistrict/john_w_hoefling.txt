mr.
john
w.
hoefling
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it's
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case,
the
center
moriches
school
district
and
the
president
of
the
board,
that
they
have
denied
access
to
the
petitioners
in
this
case
based
upon
a
well
tailored
state
statute,
the
new
york
state
education
law,
section
414,
and
a
series
of
regulations
promulgated
under
that
statute.
we
submit
that
the
school
district
has
essentially
established
a
limited
public
forum,
and
it
not
an
open
public
forum,
in
which
certain
uses
are
not
permitted.
and
we
further
submit
that
we
have...
in
the
course
of
using
this
facility
and
making
it
available
to
certain
groups
within
the
community,
have
been
consistent
in
the
uses
that
we
have
permitted.
we
submit
that
the
petitioner
is
erroneous...
has
taken
an
erroneous
position
in
looking
at
this
particular
film
series
as
being
part
of
a
larger
picture,
namely
the
use
of
the
facility
for
social,
educational,
and
community
welfare
activities.
in
fact,
if
you...
if
you
look
at
the
record,
both
in
the
district
court
from
the
testimony
of
pastor
steigerwald
and
the
submission
of
pastor
steigerwald
in
his
third
application
for
the
use
of
the
premises,
in
both
of
those
instances
he's
indicated
that
he
is
not
prepared
to
abide
by
the
regulation
of
the
district,
and,
in
fact,
he
intends
to
use
the
facility
for
educational
institution
after...
for
educational...
religious
education
after
hours
in
the
school
setting.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
it
was...
it
was
number
7,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
your
honor,
the...
the
policy
of
the
school
district
with
regard
to
this
particular
use
was
that
the
premises
would
not
be
used
for
religious
purposes.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
we
submit,
your
honor,
that
that,
as...
as
the
school
district
has
used
that
policy,
means
that
to
the
extent
somebody...
someone
is
prepared
to
come
forward
and
use
the
facilities
for
the
purpose
of
proselytization
or
urging
somebody
to
adopt
a
particular
lifestyle
which
is
based
upon
certain
religious
precepts,
is
an...
an
inappropriate
use
in
our
forum.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes,
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i...
i
think
that
the
opinion
in
widmar,
it's
very
clear
that
as
to
the
university
students
in
widmar,
the
university
is
an
open
forum.
that
is
not
the
case
in
our...
in
our
scenario
here.
and,
in
fact,
in
allowing
an
open
forum,
everybody
is
entitled
to
the
access
that
the
students--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--no,
your
honor,
i
respectfully
submit
that
what
we've
done
in
this
case
is
establish
certain
specific
uses
to
which
the
facility
may
be
put
and
certain
uses
to
which
the
facility
is...
is
not
allowed
to
be
put.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
including...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and...
and...
and
the
focus
of...
of
the
district
in
looking
at
religion
in
this
particular
regard
is
that...
and
it's
not
just
the
religious
exclusions
that
we've...
that
we've
fashioned
in
our
regulations
and
tracked
in
the
state
statute,
but
there
are
prohibitions
in
terms
of
commercial
use
of
the
premises
and
prohibitions
with
regard
to
political
uses
of
the
premises.
in
doing
that,
the
school
district
is
attempting
to
avoid
certain
controversial
areas
which,
in
terms
of
religion,
if
you
open
the
forum
to
a
particular
religious
use,
may
well
bring
you
into
conflict
with
establishment
problems
and
may
result
in
entanglement
problems
which
the
school
district
would
rather
avoid.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
and
in
order
to
avoid
that--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
i
submit,
your
honor--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--no,
your
honor.
i
submit
that...
i
submit
that
what
happens
is...
one
of
two
things
happens.
either
we
wind
up
allowing
masses
and
baptisms
and
communion
and
other
religious
services
to
occur
on
the
premises.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
i
understand
that.
and
that's
certainly--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--that's
certainly
their
right
to
do
that,
your
honor.
but
there
is
no--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--no,
there's
no
constitutional
requirement
that
that
be
allowed.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
uh-hum.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes,
your
honor.
i...
i
submit
that
in--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
submit
that--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--i
submit
that...
i
submit
that
the
first...
the
first
prong
of
the
three-pronged
test
is
that
it
must
have
a
secular
purpose.
and,
in
fact,
it
has
a
religious
purpose.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
and
not
a
secular
purpose.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
uh-hum.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
runs
into--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--yes,
sir.
and
i
think
it
also
runs
into
a
problem
in
terms
of
the
primary
effect
tends
to...
to
advance
religion
as
a
proposition,
and
that
that
is
also
the
second
prong
of
the
establishment
clause
test
that
we
run
into
difficultly
with.
i
think
that
in
recognition
of
those
problems,
the
school
district
has
stepped
back
and
attempted
to
distance
itself
from
religious
organizations
and
kept
them
out
of
this
otherwise
limited
forum,
as
it
properly
may
do
under
the
constitution.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
well,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
in
widmar,
as
this
court
has
held,
that
was
an
open
public
forum
as
to
those
students
because--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--i
think
the
result
in
widmar
probably
should
be
the
same,
because
the
framework
of
forum
analysis
in
that
case,
even
with
this
policy
in
place
in
the
university,
would
be
a
different
analysis
than
the
analysis
here.
in
widmar--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
that
is...
that
is
the
significant
difference
in
the
two
cases.
as
to
the
students
at
the
university,
the
university
is,
in
fact,
an
open
forum
for
ideas
and
discussion
and
learning
in
all
types,
in
all
levels.
in
our
particular
case,
as
to
the
students
who
attend
the
school
during
the
daytime--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
in
terms
of
student
groups?
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
in
terms
of
student
groups,
your
honor?
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
or
the
community?
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
your
honor,
we
submit
that
if
it
was
an
off
campus
nonstudent
group
who
sought
access
in
widmar,
the
forum
is
a
different
forum
than
the
university
forum
for
students
and
the
result
there
should
have
been
the
same
result
that
we
got
in
the
district
court
and
the
second
circuit
here.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
think
that
the
university
itself
is
an
example
of
an
open
public
forum.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
it...
the
university,
in
and
of
itself
as
to
the
students,
is
an
open
public
forum
under
widmar.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
your
honor,
we
submit
that
in
terms
of
a
university
setting
such
as
the
university
in
widmar,
it
was
indeed
an
open
public
forum.
it
has
traditionally
been--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
language
that
comes
out
in
our
brief
is...
is
a
function
of,
as
much
of
anything,
the
language
that
this
court
has
used
and
the
language
in
the
second
circuit.
and
we've
tried
to
accommodate
those
two
terms
together.
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
necessary
to
determine
that
there
is
specifically
a
fourth
category
of...
of
speech
regulation,
but
that
in
our
particular
case
it
certainly...
this
forum,
as
to
outside
groups,
takes
on
the
appearance
of
a
limited
public
forum
or
a
designated
public
forum
that
has
not
been
opened
up
to
the
petitioners.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
as...
as
to
those
students,
it
is
an
open
public
forum,
your
honor.
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court
has
certainly
hinted
at
that
besides
the
case
of
widmar.
there...
in
perry,
the
language
of
this
court
is
the
right
of
access
extends
only
to
other
entities
of
a
similar
character,
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
having
some
distinction
in
access
on
the
basis
of
subject
matter
and
speaker
identification.
and--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--i
don't
think--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--i
think
that
may
well
run
into
a
different
set
of
problems
than
the
problem
we're
discussing
here
today.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
because
i
don't
think
you
have
the
same
establishment
clause
problems
and
entanglement
problems
that
you
confronted
in
a--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--in
a
religious
setting.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
no,
your
honor.
we
submit
that
it's
a
limited
public
forum--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--i
submit
that,
again,
in
terms
of
areas
involving
political
speech
and
religious
speech--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--the
school
district
has
elected
in
this
particular
locality,
and
in
the
state
of
new
york,
to
exclude
those
types
of
speakers.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
and
i
submit
that--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--yes.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes,
your
honor.
i...
i
submit
that
the
school
district,
if
it
were
to
characterize
those
types
of
speech
as
political
speech,
could,
in
fact,
exclude
those
speakers.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
your
honor,
we...
we
submit
that
the...
the
statute,
the
scheme
that's
been
established
by
the
statute
and
the
regulations
closes
the
forum
to
certain
particular
groups.
one
of
those
groups
are
people
who
use
the
forum
to
proselytize
a
particular
religious
point
of
view.
that
is
not
something
we'd
be
confronted
with
by
the
example
you
cite.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
well,
your
honor,
i
think,
again,
that
comes
down
to
the
focus
of
how...
how
narrow
it
is
you
look
at
the
speech
that's
being
engaged
in.
we've
looked
at
this
in
terms
of
religious
speech
and
we
haven't
compared
it
to
nonreligious
speech
or
irreligious
speech
or
antireligious
speech,
and
we
submit
that
in
terms
of
religious
speakers
we
have
been
consistent
in
our
policy
and
that
that
is
permitted
within
a
limited
public
forum.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
it
is--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--well,
your
honor,
it--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--it
is
lawful
to
the
extent
that
it
has
been
a
longstanding
policy
and
it
exhibits
the
intention
of
this
district
and
the
state
of
new
york
not
to
open
up
their
school
districts,
across
the
board,
to
any
and
all
comers.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
well,
i
submit
that
someplace
even
inbetween
there,
your
honor,
we...
we
come
up
with
the
question
as
to
what
is
the
next
film
series--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--that
lamb's
chapel
wants
to
show
and
who
is
it
that
is
going
to
be
speaking
at
that
film
series
and
how
much
are
we
to
censor
or
look
at
or
wonder
about
whether
this
is
permissible
or
not
permissible
religious
speech--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--on
behalf
of--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--your
honor,
we
submit
that
they
have
already
decided
that
when
they've
told
us
in
their
application
that,
in
fact,
it's
going
to
be
religious
in
nature.
and
that's
enough
for
us.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
we
submit
that--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--your
honor,
we
submit
that
there
are
often
situations
in
which
questions
must
be
asked
of
a
religious
group,
at
least
on
the
surface,
to
see
if
they
qualify
for
certain
tax
benefits
or
certain
other
entitlements,
but
that
doesn't
necessarily
involve
entanglement.
but
when
we
get
to
the
point
where
we
are
prescreening
what
they're
going
to
show
to
see
whether
or
not
it's
too
religious
or
too
close
to
a
mass
or
a
service,
too
close
to
proselytizing,
that
becomes
a
very
difficult
issue
and
really
does
create
entanglement
problems
for
the
district.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
again,
i
suspect
that
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
speech,
your
honor,
and
it's
an
issue
that
the
school
district
would
rather
not
get
involved
in
screening.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
i
have
not
problem
with
free
exercise
in...
in
a
public
forum,
your
honor.
but
in
a
limited
public
forum
such
as
we
advocate
and
the
second
circuit
has...
the
district
court
and
the
second
circuit
has
found
we
have
here,
we
see
no
need
to
open
the
forum
up
to
the
religious
speaker.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
i
understand
that,
judge,
but
i...
your
honor,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
picture
that
this
court
has
drawn,
the
framework
that
this
court
has
put
together
through
the
years
from
greer
and
widmar
and
perry
and
the
cases
that
outline
forum
analysis,
i
think
it
is
a
useful
framework
for
the
school
district
and
for
other
local
government
officials
to
govern
what
they
can
and
cannot
do
without
running
into
constitutional
problems
in
the
free
speech
area.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
it's
neutral
in
that--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--yes,
your
honor.
we
submit
that
it's
neutral
because,
in
fact,
nobody
with
a
religious
perspective
is
permitted
to
use
the
facility
in
terms
of
proselytizing
their
faith.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
i'm...
i'm
not
certain
that
that's
a
fair
characterization,
but
if...
if
we
were
to
look
at
that
as
a
hypothetical,
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--yes,
i
have
no
problem
with
that
as
a
hypothetical.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
well,
in
terms
of
the
area
of
religious
freedom
in
a
limited
public
forum,
the
school
district
is
concerned
with
not
only
the
free
speech
aspects
of
allowing
religious
speakers
to
come
in,
but
they're
concerned
about
establishment
problems
and
they're
concerned
about
entanglement
problems.
that
is
those
other
categories
are
not
problems
that
we
are
confronted
with
with
regard
to
nonreligious
speakers,
and
on
that
basis
i
see
a
distinction
that
is
worth...
worth
making.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes,
your
honor,
it
still
is.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
well,
your
honor--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's...
that--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--i
think
that
might
be
a
question
better
posed
to
politicians
who
have
been
elected
in
the
state
of
new
york
than
myself,
your
honor.
we...
we
submit
that...
that
particular
sentence
that's
in
the
attorney
general's
brief
is
not
necessarily
something
that...
that
i
personally
would
subscribe
to.
that
does
not...
that
does
not
mean,
however,
that
there
is
some
type
of
constitutional
compulsion
to
open
the
school
district
to
a
religious
speaker
simply
because
there
is
some
moral
force
which
religious
speakers
bring
with
them
that
otherwise
betters
the
community.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
have
no
problem
with
that,
the
position
you've
just
stated.
i
just
don't
think
that,
again,
the
fact
that
religion
has
a
particular
positive
influence
in
the
community
that
extends
even
beyond
believers
is,
of
itself,
enough
to
require
a
school
district
to
grant
access
to
religious
speakers.
your
honor,
justice
o'connor
asked
a
question
about
the
reasonableness
before.
there
are...
although,
to
be...
to
be
honest
with
you,
i
don't
think
the
record
has
developed
this.
i
think
there
are
good
reasons
for
the
school
district
to
have
a
distinction
between
religious
speakers
and
nonreligious
speakers
in
a
limited
public
forum
such
as
we've
established
here.
i
think
the
same
thing
can
be
said
for
political
speakers
and
in
terms
of
avoiding
controversy,
allowing
the
school
system
to
be
about
the
business
of...
the
principal
business
of
educating
the
children
entrusted
to
its
care.
that
those
types
of
purposes
are
reasonable
purposes
and
reasonable
enough
to
support
the
invocation
of
this
particular
rule.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
that's
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
i
have
no...
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
was
done
otherwise.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
your
honor,
i
submit
that
if...
if
this
facility
were
leased
to
a
religious
organization
that
wanted
to
use
it
for
its
own
services,
you
wind
up
with
questions
about
the
character
and
purposes
of
the
institution
that's
benefitted,
which
becomes...
becomes
the
religious
institution
itself,
by
virtue
of
having
a
space
that
it
doesn't
otherwise
have
available
to
it.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
it
does
increase--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--i...
i
submit
to
you
that
general
motors...
leasing
the
premises
to
general...
general
motors
does
not
create
the
same
establishment
types
of
problems,
establishment
clause
types
of
problems
that
you
have
with
a
religious
institution.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
i
think
that
you...
we
wind
up
with
a
situation
where
if...
if
the
purpose
of
the
debate--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--i
hadn't
really
given
that
any
thought,
your
honor.
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
you,
again,
begin
to
bring
into
play
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the...
the
religious
speaker
is...
is
going
to
use
the
forum
to
proselytize
their
faith.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
and
so
the
question
becomes
how
many
people
on
the
part
of
the--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--again,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
question
that
we're
concerned
about
is
whether
or
not
proselytization
is
something
that
starts
to
happen
in
the
school
facility.
and--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--i
don't
think
the
numbers
have
anything--
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
--i
don't
think
the
numbers
have
anything
to
do
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
i
understand,
your
honor.
i
submit
that
the
school
district
nonetheless
has
the
right
to
keep
that
particular
type
of
activity
from
occurring
because
of
our
concern
about
religious
uses.
mr.
john
w.
hoefling
yes,
your
honor,
under
those
circumstances
i
would
submit
so.
thank
you,
your
honor.
