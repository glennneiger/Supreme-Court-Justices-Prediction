justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
kind
of
a
general
question
that...
i
always
have
trouble
figuring
out
what
the
people
are
fighting
about
here.
if
i
understand,
one
of
your
submissions
was
that
the
civil
investigation
is
all
over.
so,
they
have
no
right
to
keep
this
stuff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
other
thing
that's
in
the
back
of
my
mind
is
your...
the
individual
client
is
deceased
now,
so
there's
no
danger
of
criminal
proceedings
against
him.
what
is
the
risk
of
something
happening
to
somebody
that
may
be
affected
by
the
outcome
of
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
mr.
wallace,
but
those
are
statutory
protections
for
the
taxpayers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
one
of
the
issues
before
was
whether
in
addition
to
the
statutory
protections,
the
district
court
had
any
authority
to
enter
specific
protective
provisions.
what's
your
position
now
on
that?
do
you
still
take
the
position
there's
no
such
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
your...
can
i
just
kind
of
ask
you?
i'm
not
as
familiar
nearly
as
you
are
with
these
new
statutory
provisions,
but
the
case
that
runs
through
my
mind
is
supposing
i've
got
some
corporate
minute
books
that
are
subpoenaed,
and
i
resist
the
subpoena
on
the
ground
that
it's
not
relevant
or
burdensome
or
something
or
other.
and
the
judge
rules
against
me
and
says
you
got
to...
you
must
deliver
the
corporate
minute
books,
and
i
deliver
them.
could
the
judge
have
said,
i'm
entitled
to
get
copies
of
those
from
the...
say
i've
complied
with
the
subpoena
and
delivered
the
books.
and
would
the
judge
say
to
the...
have
the
power
to
say
to
the
government,
you
must
give
copies
of
these...
either
return
them
within
30
days
or
give
them
copies
so
they
can
work...
run
the
office?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
i'm
talking
about
this
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
can
the
order...
my
question
is
really
can
the
district
court
say
to
you
i
think
the
reasonable
time
is
30
days,
return
them
after
30
days?
would
that
be
within
the
authority
of
the
district
court
to
fix
the
reasonable
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
if
he
has
that
authority--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
the
judge
has
that
authority,
could
he
not
say
there's
no
request
for
it
at
the
time
of
the
delivery?
could
the
subpoenaed
party
go
into
court
10
days
later
and
say
we
find
we
need
the
documents,
would
you
direct
the
government
to
give
us...
give
them
back
to
us
in
the
next
3
weeks
or
else
give
us
copies?
could
they
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
wouldn't
there
be
an
implied
condition
in
a
case
like
this
that
the
copies...
if
the
original
or
copies
are
being
used
by
the
government,
they
shall
not
be
kept
any...
for
any
period
of
time
beyond
the
time
they
serve
some
useful
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that
was
an
implied
condition,
then
under
your
explanation,
the
judge
would
have
the
power
to
say,
well,
look,
you've
had
these
things
for
7
years
and
you
haven't
done
anything.
give
them
back.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
that
very
point
of
voluntary
compliance,
supposing
i
turned
over
the
minute
books,
i
got
the
subpoena,
i
gave
you
the
minute
books,
and
you
used
them.
and
about
4
years
later,
i
think,
gee,
i
need
those
because
i
got
to
make...
bring
my
minute
books
up
to
date.
how
does
the...
what
right
does
the
taxpayer
have
to
get
those
minute
books
back?
is
there
any
statutory
provision
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just...
they
just
complied
with
the
subpoena.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
3
years
later,
i
say,
gee,
i
want
those...
my
records
back.
does
he
have
a
right
to
get
the
records
back,
and
if
so,
what
is
the
statutory
basis
for
getting
them
back?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
statutory
provision--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--sort
of
the
common
law
rights
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
wallace,
can
i
ask
you
another
question
about...
just
a
general
question,
not
the
details
of
this
very
complex
case.
you've
explained
to
me
that
when
there's
a
production
of
originals,
there's
a
kind
of
an
implied
condition
of
keeping
them
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
is
there
also
an
implied
condition
that
if
the
government
decides
to
make
copies
and
return
the
originals,
that
the
copies
will
be
returned
within
a
reasonable
period
of
time
if
they've
served
their
purpose
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
your
view
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--just
so
that
i
understand
this,
if
you
do
manage
to
get...
successfully
subpoena
something
and
overcome
an
objection
to
production,
you
have
an
absolute
statutory
right
to
retain
copies
forever.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you
don't
do
that,
but
that's
what
the
law
would
authorize
you
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i
understand.
but
just
so
i'm
clear
on
it,
your
position
is
that
the
law
entitles
you
to
retain
the
copies
forever
if
you
lawfully
get
possession
of
the
originals
pursuant
to
a
subpoena.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
the
answer
is
yes.
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
the
return
of
the
originals--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--after
a
reasonable
time
was
also
implied.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
thought
your
position
was
he
had
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--put
himself
in
contempt
of
court
in
order
to
appeal.
he
has
to
just
not
produce
the
documents,
but
if
he
does
produce
them,
even
if
he...
the
judge
was
wrong,
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game
in
your
view.
