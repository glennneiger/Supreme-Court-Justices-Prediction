mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
thank
you.
mr.
justice
and
may
it...
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
the
question
whether
compliance
with
a
district
court
order
enforcing
an
internal
revenue
service
summons
renders
any
subsequent
appeal
moot.
the
district
court
below
on
remand
enforced
an
irs
summons
for
production
of
audio
tapes
held
by
a
disinterested
third
party
record
holder,
the
clerk
of
the
superior
court
of
california.
while
the
case
was
on
appeal,
after
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed,
the
clerk
of
the
superior
court
complied
with
the
district
court's
order
and
permitted
the
irs
to
inspect
and
copy
the
tapes.
subsequently,
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
appeal
from
the
production
order
as
moot
without
considering
or
hearing
argument
on
the
merits.
in
doing
so,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
once
a
district
court
enforces
an
internal
revenue
service
summons
for
the
production
of
documents,
and
once
the
documents
are
turned
over
the
irs
by
either
the
taxpayer
or
by
a
disinterested
third-party
record
holder,
the
case
becomes
moot.
this
rule
applies
no
matter
what
proprietary,
privacy,
or
other
interests
the
taxpayer
may
have
in
the
documents
and,
of
course,
no
matter
how
meritorious
the
taxpayer's
appeal
may
be
on
the
merits,
even
if
the
taxpayer
is
claiming
privilege,
irs
bad
faith,
or
that
there
is
no
legitimate,
ongoing
internal
revenue
service
investigation.
the
court
of
appeals'
rule
here
is
contrary
to
well-established
mootness
doctrine
as
enunciated
by
this
court
and
by
the
lower
federal
courts.
determination
of
whether
a
case
is
moot
has
long
rested
on
two
interrelated
considerations:
first,
the
existence
of
an
actual,
live
controversy
between
the
parties;
and
second,
whether
the
courts
may
grant
any
effectual
relief
to
the
prevailing
party.
the
emphasis
here
is
upon
the
question
of
whether
any
relief
may
be
afforded
even
if
it
is
only
partial
relief
or
relief
other
than
that
originally
sought
at
the
outset
of
the
case.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that's
true.
first
of
all,
when
this
court
decided
the
first
zolin
case,
it
found
that
in
deciding
the
crime-fraud
issue
on
an
attorney-client
privilege
issue,
the
district
court
could
look
at
any
evidence
not
privileged
and
lawfully
obtained
by
the
government,
and
it
specifically
noted
that
the
question
of
whether
the
partial
transcripts
in
this
case
were
lawfully
obtained.
it
then
remanded
to
the
ninth
circuit,
which
again
declined
to
reach
the
issue
of
whether
the
transcripts
were
lawfully
obtained,
and
remanded
to
the
district
court
for
determination
of
whatever
other
objections
the
parties
may
raise,
specifically
noting
that
it
was
not
reaching
that
particular
issue.
secondly--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
but
certiorari
was
not
sought
on
that
issue.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
oh,
no,
your
honor.
we
did
not
seek
certiorari
on
that
issue,
and
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold
that
that
issue
was
precluded
from
the
district
court.
it
simply
said
on
this
appeal,
we
are
not
going
to
be
considering
that
issue.
it
did
not
say
that
the
issue
had
been
waived,
and
it
remanded
to
the
district
court
to
consider
that
issue
and
any
other
objections
the
party
might
raise.
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
from
that
particular
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
transcripts
had
been
obtained
lawfully,
either
on
the
merits
or
how
it
was
dealt
with
procedurally,
was
not
even
raised.
now,
the
other
issue--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--well,
there
was
no
reason
to,
your
honor,
because
we
were
being
remanded
for
the
opportunity
to
raise
it
in
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
preclude
us
from
raising
it
on
the
remand
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
then
ordering
to
the
district
court.
the
court
of
appeals
said
subject
to
whatever
other
issues
the
parties
may
raise,
and
footnoted
right
at
that
point,
that
it
is
not
reaching
the
issue
of
unlawfully
obtained.
it
does
not
say
it
is
precluded.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
they're
partial
transcripts,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--well,
one
thing
that
we
were
urging
below,
your
honor,
was
that
the
district
court
look
at
the
entire
tapes
because
we
believe
that
they
would
show
that
the
privilege
still
remained.
now,
if
it's
true
that
it
was
improper
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
look
at
the
partial
transcripts,
then
the
whole
issue
of
looking...
of
what
evidence
the
district
court
has
available
to
it
to
look
at
becomes
a
live
issue,
and
it
must
look
then,
if
it
is
going
to
look
at
anything,
at
the
entire
case.
but
there
is
another
issue...
live
issue
before
the
district
court
as
well,
which
arose
even
subsequent
to
the
ninth
circuit's
decision,
and
that
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
is
at
the
time
of
the
production
order
in
this
case,
whether
there
was
a
live,
ongoing
internal
revenue
service
investigation.
as
we
showed
to
the
district
court,
which
refused
to
consider
the
issue
on
the
merits--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--it
gets
a
little
confusing,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
since
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
and
the
opinion
reported
at
905
f.
2d,
which
is
not
the
opinion
from
which
this
certiorari
petition
was
granted,
the
ninth
circuit
remanded
to
the
district
court.
when
the
case
was
back
before
the
district
court,
evidence
was
developed
at
the...
from
the
testimony
of
internal
revenue
service
agents
in
other
cases
that
there
was
no
ongoing
investigation.
we
wished
then
to
raise
with
the
district
court
that
there
no
longer
could
be
a
basis
for
an
order
disclosing
documents
since
there
was
no
longer
a
legitimate
purpose.
that
issue
was
denied
us
by
the
district
court.
that
was
the...
one
of
the
issues
we
wished
to
raise
on
the
merits
on
the
appeal
back
to
the
ninth
circuit,
which
the
ninth
circuit
refused
to
hear
on
the
grounds
that
the
case
was
now
moot
because
the
irs
now
had
the
documents.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
the
ninth
circuit
could
have
granted
us
the
following
relief.
one,
it
could
have
held
that
there...
at
the
time
of
the
production
order,
there
was
no...
we
had
proved
that
there
was
no
ongoing
legitimate
internal
revenue
service
investigation.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
the
irs
wouldn't
get
the
documents.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
but...
oh,
and
then
it
could
have
required
the
irs
to
return
the
documents
and
the
copies,
just
as
this
court
ordered,
for
example,
the
justice
department
to
do
in
the
sells
case.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
under
seal,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
it
would
have
protected
our
privacy
interest
in
the
documents.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
no.
we
were
asking
for
return
of
the
copies
as
well,
relief
twice
afforded
in
this
case
by
the
district
court.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
no,
that's
not
right,
your
honor.
no
more
true...
that
is
no
more
true
in
this
case
than
it
was
in
the
sells
case
or
in
the
g.m.
leasing
case.
in
both
of
those
cases...
first,
take
sells.
in
the
sells
case,
where
the
grand
jury,
pursuant
to
court
order,
had
turned
over
records
to
the
civil
department
of
the
justice
department
and
the
government
claimed
that
therefore
the
appeal
from
that
order
was
moot,
the
ninth
circuit
and
this
court
both
agreed
that
the
case
was
not
moot
because
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
power
to
order
the
civil
department
of
the
justice
department
to
turn
over
the
originals
and
the
copies
of
the
record,
and
that
would
afford
partial
relief
to
the
individual.
similarly,
in
each
and
every
one
of
the
cases
involving
federal
trade
commission
subpoenas,
for
which
the
government
must
seek
a
court
order
of
enforcement,
in
numerous
cases,
the
similar
situation
has
arisen
where
in
the
course
of
the
appeal,
because
of
a
lack
of
a
stay,
the
documents
were,
in
fact,
turned
over
to
the
federal
trade
commission
and--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--let
me
be
quite
clear
about
that.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
in
sells,
the
issue
was
not
whether
there
were
going
to
be
further
disclosures
from
the
grand
jury
to
the
justice
department.
that
disclosure
had
been--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--that's
right.
further
disclosures
within
the
civil
division
of
the
justice
department
and,
as
this
court
noted
in
sells,
to
prevent
the
continuing
access
of
those
to
whom
the
materials
have
already
been
disclosed.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
no.
we
are
talking
about
something
that's--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--going
on
today,
tomorrow--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--not
in
the
past.
that's
right.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
precisely
the
same
good
that
it
was
going
to
do
the
person
in
the
sells
case,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
precisely
the
same
thing
as
here
too.
the
irs
has
these
tapes
and
is
disclosing
these
things
among
itself,
and
the
people
who
have
had
access
have
continuing
access,
just
as
in
sells.
similarly,
in
g.m.
leasing.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
that's
a
very
good
question,
your
honor,
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
cases--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--that's
right.
that's
right.
if
you
look
at
the
cases,
other
than
the
third
circuit
cases
which,
of
course,
hold
in
our
favor,
you
have
about
28
decisions.
i
submit
not
one
of
them
analyzes
the
question.
the
first
case,
lawhon
or
lawhon--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--i
submit
that
if
you
look
at
them,
they
haven't
analyzed
it
very
much
at
all.
the
first
case,
lawhon,
fifth
circuit,
appeal
dismissed
as
moot
because
the
documents,
says
the
fifth
circuit,
were
already
turned
over
to
the
irs
and
were
returned
to
the
taxpayer.
so,
that
case
was
correctly
decided.
that
was
moot.
the
next
case
and
the
next
case
after
that--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--that's
not
clear
from--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--well,
that's
true.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
that's
true.
from
everything
we
can
tell,
it
would
appear
that
it
was--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--your
honor,
the
fifth
circuit
in
lawhon
specifically
stated
the
documents
were
returned
to
the
taxpayer.
i
don't
know
whether
there
may
have
been
additional
copies
or
not.
but
if
you
look
at
every
subsequent
decision,
it
says
we
rely
on
lawhon...
or
we
rely
on
the
last
case,
which
relied
on
lawhon.
this
is
moot.
there
is
no
analysis
in
those
cases.
the
only
cases
dealing
with
irs
summons
enforcement,
which
analyzed
the
question--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--no,
but
that's
not
true.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
that's
not
true.
that's
precisely
my
point,
justice
white.
in
lawhon,
from
what
we
can
tell--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--the
other
cases,
the
documents
weren't
returned,
and
therefore
we
think
they
were
incorrectly
decided.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
that's
precisely
right,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
the
language
of
that
statute,
as
with
this
statute,
permits...
authorizes
the
federal
courts
to
enforce
a
subpoena
order
when
the
ftc
brings
a
proceeding.
in
those
cases...
and
here
there
is
a
line
of
authority
which
is
also
fairly
uniform,
and
it's
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
line
of
authority
in
the
summons
enforcement
cases.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
that's
precisely
correct.
and
the
government
attempts
to
make
a
distinction
with
the
ftc
cases
by
saying
that
those
cases
are
all
adjudicatory
subpoena
cases
and,
therefore,
that
it's
the
equivalent
of
a
suppression
order,
but
that's
not
true.
some
of
the
cases
are
adjudicatory.
some
of
them
are
investigatory
subpoenas.
the
most
recent
case,
the
invention
submission
case,
cited
in
our
briefs,
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
was
clearly
an
investigatory
subpoena,
and
the
government
acknowledged
that
the
case
was
not
moot
merely
because
the
documents
had
been
turned
over
to
the
ftc
because,
it
said,
the
documents
and
the
copies
can
be
returned
or
the
copies
can
be
destroyed,
just
as
in
sells.
in
the
search
and
seizure
area,
the
government
cites
the
general
motors
leasing
corporation
case
to
support
its
view,
and
quite
frankly,
i
find
that
rather
peculiar
because
i
think,
if
anything,
g.m.
leasing
suggests
that
we
are
correct
in
this.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
your
honor,
because
the
original
of
the
tapes
is
still--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--with
the
superior
court
of
los
angeles
county.
the
government
inspected
and
copied
the
tapes.
it
did
not
keep
the
originals.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
that's
right.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
that's
correct.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
your
honor,
if
we're
correct
that
there
is
no
ongoing
investigation,
then
the
risk
is
simply
the
risk
that
any
citizen
faces
in
having
his
or
her
private
papers
in
the
possession
of
the
government
for
it
to
rummage
through
or
use
as
it
wishes
when
there's
no
particular
legitimate
law
enforcement
or
other
purpose
for
it
having
done
so.
and
that
is--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--well,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
an
imaginary
person.
this
is
a
live...
there
is
a
live
party
here
who
has
live
records
involving
conversations
and
private
activities
which
it
retains
an
interest
in.
in
fact.
congress
specifically
recognized
this
interest.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
congress
thought
it
would,
your
honor,
because
congress
provided
a
scheme
whereby
the
irs,
when
it
seeks
documents
in
the
summons
proceeding...
its
summons
is
not
self-executing.
it
must
go
to
the
federal
court.
it
must
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
to
obtain
the
documents,
and
it
provides
the
taxpayer
with
a
defense,
a
defense
that
the
irs
is
not
entitled
to
the
documents
unless
it
can
show,
one,
that
there
is
an
ongoing
investigation,
and
two,
that
they're
relevant
to
that
investigation.
if
there's
not
an
ongoing
investigation,
the
taxpayer
has
a
right
to
the
privacy
of
his
documents.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
that's
right.
that
is
our
argument
on
the
merits.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
i
was
addressing
the
specific
question.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
yes.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
no,
not
under
the
order
that
the
district
court
granted
in
the
original
case
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
and
which
this
court
affirmed
by
an
equally
divided
court.
the
irs
is
precluded
from
making
those
documents
public.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
that's
right.
it's
within
the
irs
for
use
as
it
may
deem
fit
and
where
there
is
no
continuing
investigation.
congress--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
ftc
would
ordinarily
be
free
to
just
make
public
documents
it
obtained
through
a
subpoena
in
a
situation
like
that.
i
mean,
if
it
wound
up
introducing
them
into
a
court
proceeding,
then
of
course,
they
would
become
public.
but
in
the
ftc
situation,
the
party
who
turned
over
the
documents
would
certainly
have
an
interest
in
receiving
return
of
those
documents
and
destruction
of
copies
if
the
ftc,
it
turned
out,
was
not
conducting
an
investigation
and
that
they
served
no
legitimate
purpose
for
the
ftc.
congress
also...
i
just
want
to
point
out
a
second
way
in
which
congress
has
recognized
this
interest.
when
congress
amended
section
7609
to
provide
for
the
automatic
right
of
a
taxpayer
to
intervene
when
a
summons
is
directed
to
a
disinterested
third-party
record
holder,
congress
took
the
position
that
the
taxpayer...
and
this
is
made
manifest
in
the
legislative
history...
taxpayer
may
have
civil
or
privacy
rights
in
those
documents
and
thus
has
a
right
of
intervention,
per
se,
to
protect
that
interest.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
i
think
we've
done
everything
that
one
could
possibly
imagine.
we
certainly
sought
stays
of
the
production
order
pending
appeal.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
it's
very
interesting,
your
honor.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
not
since
this
case
went
up,
your
honor.
i
must
say
that.
the
government
has
maintained
its
position
on
this
appeal
that
it
has
a
continuing
right
to
these
documents.
if
it--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--if
it...
i'm
sorry.
yes?
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
you're
right
that
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
that
based
upon
the
evidence
before
it
at
the
time,
the
crime
fraud
exception
had
been
made
out,
but
it
did
not
rule
that
the
documents
had
to
be
turned
over.
it
remanded
for
further
objections,
including
objection
to
the
question
whether
the
evidence
that
was
the...
upon
which
the
ninth
circuit
was
ruling
was
properly
before
it
and
also
for
determination
of
any
further
objections
the
taxpayer
might
make.
that
was
the
specific
basis
for
the
remand.
so,
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
end
the
case.
the
ninth
circuit
remanded
with
an
opportunity
to
make
further
objections
and
specifically
reserved
one
of
the
particular
objections
we're
making.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
the
issue
on
the
appeal...
on
the
merits
of
the
appeal...
of
course,
we
think
we
were
correct
that
we
had
meritorious
issues.
certainly
it's
possible
that
we
could
have
lost
the
appeal.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
it's
conceivable
they
could
have
done
that,
certainly.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
they
wouldn't,
no.
i
think
they
would
have
been
incorrect.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
for
the
reasons
i've
stated.
the
remand
order
left
open
certain
questions.
those
questions...
take--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--well,
the
ninth
circuit
remand
order
was
somewhat--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--well,
there
was...
actually
there
was
never
any
question
of
evidentiary
use,
and
the
ninth
circuit's
remand--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--well,
that's
right.
and
when
on
remand...
i'm
sorry.
on
remand,
when
it
went
down
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
noted
that
the
ninth
circuit
obviously
was
somewhat
confused
about
the
status
of
the
case.
the
question
wasn't
whether
the
tapes
were
to
be
introduced
or
not
introduced
into
an
ongoing
proceeding.
the
question
was
whether
they
were
to
be
produced
to
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
your
honor,
i
must
take
exception
with
that,
precisely
because
they
footnoted
right
there
the
question
of
not
reaching
the
issue
of
whether
the
documents
were
lawfully
obtained.
in
addition,
there
is
the
additional
objection
we
raised
of
whether
there
was
an
ongoing
investigation.
now,
i
think
the
important
issue,
the
thing
to
keep
in
mind
here,
is
that
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
our
appeal
was
moot,
not
whether
or
not
we
would
have
won
or
lost
that
appeal.
this
is
an
issue
which
has
broad
reference
to
summons
enforcement
cases.
as
has
been
noted,
there
is
a
split
in
the
circuits
on
it.
most
of
the
circuits
go
against
us,
and...
but
most
of
those
circuit
decisions
against
us,
i
submit,
are
contrary
to
parallel
lines
of
authority
dealing
with
the
federal
trade
commission
cases,
dealing
with
the
sells
engineering
case,
and
that
those
cases
really
do
not
come
to
terms
with
the
issues.
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
wallace
is
incorrect
in
stating
that
the
government
never
made
copies
and
never
returned
copies
previously.
as
we
point
out
on
pages
9
to
10
of
our
reply
brief,
the
government
made
seven
copies
of
the
tapes
and
they
reduced
them
to
two
cassette
tapes
and
a
computer
disk.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
when
the
government
returned
the
copies
on
march
14,
1991,
after
having
received
them
the
second
time...
and
this
is
noted
on
the
docket--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--that's
right.
they
had
had
them
for
50
days.
their
action--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--yes,
they
did,
and
those
were
returned
as
well.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
that's
precisely
correct,
and
by
their
action
in
seeking
them
for
a
third
time,
they
thereby
demonstrated
that
the
case
was
not
moot
because
the
relief
had
been
effectual.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
they
needed
them
again.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
that's
precisely
correct.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
it's
in
the
record,
your
honor;
if
you
look
at
the
docket
sheet
on
items
number
75
and
77
on
pages
74
and
75
of
the
excerpts
of
record.
i
just
want
to
clarify
one
other
point.
we
are
arguing
that
there
was
no
legitimate
purpose...
no
legitimate
investigation
at
the
time
of
the
disclosure
order,
and
therefore
the
government
never
had
a
right
to
obtain
the
documents,
not
that
at
some
reasonable
time
thereafter,
the
documents
had
to
be
returned.
therefore,
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
court
invoked
by
the
government
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress
was
still
applicable.
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
well,
you
raise
a
very
interesting
question
which
we
raise
in
this
case,
your
honor.
we
had
no
opportunity
to
stand
on
our
rights
because
this
summons
was
directed
to
a
disinterested
third-party
record
holder,
and
in...
we
particularly
urged
that
in
that
context,
the
case
cannot
be
deemed
as
moot
because
even
if
in
the
taxpayer
disclosure
situation,
you
can
argue
that
the
taxpayer,
albeit
it
under
threat
of
contempt,
gave
up
his
interest
in
the
controversy,
that
certainly
can't
be
said
as
here--
mr.
eric
m.
lieberman
--where
the
taxpayer
had
no
opportunity
to
do
so.
thank
you
very
much.
