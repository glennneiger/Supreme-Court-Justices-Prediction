well,
mr.
lieberman,
i
take
it
all
the
issues
on
the
merits
in
this
litigation
are
finished.
they're
decided.
they're
resolved,
are
they
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lieberman,
there's
a
similar
statute
for
subpoena
power
that
covers
the
ftc.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
language
of
that
statute
the
same
as
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
are
a
series
of
cases
in
which
the
ftc
has
subpoenaed
material
in
the
course
of
its
investigations,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
which
the
appellate
courts
have
held
that
they
still
have
jurisdiction
to
order
a
return
of
the
documents--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--subpoenaed
and
the
copies?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
the
risk
of
further
disclosure
is
limited
to
employees
of
the
irs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
it
may
be
a
smaller
risk,
in
effect,
than
would
be
the
case
with
the
ftc,
i
suppose,
where
very
significant
client
information
or
even
information
about
how
goods
are
made
or
produced
could
be
obtained
by
the
public
if
they
weren't
returned.
is
that...
is
there
a
difference
at
all
in
the
risk?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
wallace,
i
think
my
concern
is
really
the
effect
of
saying
this
case
is
moot,
what
effect
that
would
have
in
the
ftc
context
where
i
think
people
have
a
lot
at
stake
there
in
getting
back
their
documents.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
courts
have
followed
two
different
tracks
under
virtually
identical
subpoena
statutes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
mean,
the
plain
fact
is
there's
a
lot
at
stake
in
leaving
some
of
this
privileged
information
in
the
hands
of
offices
that
have
no
further
use
for
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
there
were
two
previous
occasions
when
the
tapes
were
surrendered
to
the
irs
and
then
ordered
returned.
did
those
both
deal
with
the
originals,
or
did
those
orders
deal
also
with
copies?
in
this
case,
were
there
not
two
previous
occasions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
government
in
those
cases...
in
those
instances
argue
mootness
or
raise
this
same--
