mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
current
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
is
under
review,
we
argued
both
that
petitioner's
claims
were
res
judicata
and
that
the
appeal
was
moot
because
all
of
the
materials
had,
in
fact,
been
produced
because
of
the
denial
of
stays
and
the
originals
had
been
returned.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
our
res
judicata
contentions,
but
decided
only
that
the
appeal
was
moot.
we
argued
both
that
the
claims
that
are
being
made
are
claims
that
have
already
been
resolved
against
petitioners,
and
even
if
some
of
the
claims
were
not,
they
could
have
been
raised
at
the
earlier
stage,
and
unlike
collateral
estoppel,
under
principles
of
res
judicata,
the
claims
are
barred
because
it's
the
same
litigation
between
the
same
parties,
and
petitioner
is
not
free
to
raise
these
claims
seriatim
rather
than
all
at
once.
but
we
have
not
urged
the
court...
we've
pointed
out
this
obstacle
to
petitioner's
prevailing,
but
we
have
not
urged
this
court
to
reach
and
sort
out
the
res
judicata
issues
which
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach.
we
assumed
that
the
court
granted
certiorari
to
decide
the
question
presented
in
the
petition,
which
was
the
mootness
question
on
which
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
circuits,
and
that
is
what
we
have
addressed.
it's
possible
that
the
court
would
conclude
that
the
res
judicata
obstacle
to
petitioner's
prevailing
is
a
reason
to
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted,
but
we
have
not
urged
that
either.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
indeed,
and
i
thought
we
had
satisfied
our
duty
to
the
court
in
pointing
out
these
problems
in
our
brief
in
opposition,
perhaps
not
as
elaborately
as
one
might.
briefs
in
opposition
are
done
in
quantities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
quite
agree
with
you
that
the
courts
have
followed
a
different
track,
certainly
the
d.c.
circuit,
in
the
federal
trade
commission
cases.
we
would
not
urge
in
this
case
for
the
court
to
resolve
how
those
questions
should
be
decided
under
the
federal
trade
commission
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
can
be
protective
orders,
and
there
are
various
statutory
restrictions
on
disclosure
of
confidential
information.
the
ones
in
the
internal
revenue
code
happen
to
be
among
the
most
comprehensive
in
any
federal
statute.
there
are
specific
provisions
in
the
internal
revenue
code
governing
the
service's
disclosure
of
confidential
information.
we
summarize
these
in
some
detail
in
the
brief
that
we
filed
in
this
court
the
last
time
around
in
this
case
in
united
states
against
zolin.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
our
position
in
litigation
in
other
cases.
this
court,
by
an
equally
divided
court,
affirmed
the
judgment
in
this
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so,
that
issue
is
no
longer
open
in
this
case.
the
law
of
this
case
is
that
the
particular
restrictions
entered
in
this
order
have
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
affirming
that
judgment,
but
we
have
won
an
en
banc
decision
to
the
contrary
in
another
circuit,
and
we
continue
to
litigate
that
issue
elsewhere.
but
that
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
there
probably
is
authority
in
dealing
with
subpoenas
under
other
statutes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
under
this
statute,
there
is
a
statutory
requirement
that
production,
when
it's
ordered,
be
for
a
reasonable
time
and
under
reasonable
circumstances.
i'm
referring
to
section
7605(a),
and
that
generally
has
been
understood
to
mean
that
we
can
keep
the
originals
only
for
a
reasonable
time
and
then
should
return
the
originals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
rather
seldom
done
in
these
summons
enforcement
orders,
but
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
that
because
one
could
even
argue
that
there's
a
condition
implied
in
law
when
the
summons
is
enforced--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
we
can
only
keep
the
originals
for
a
reasonable
time
under
7605(a).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
that
once
a
production
has
occurred,
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
has
ended
under
the
narrow
jurisdiction
conferred
to
enforce
an
internal
revenue
summons,
but
that
the
court,
as
any
court
does,
retains
authority
to
enforce
its
order.
and
if,
in
fact,
an
implied
in
law
condition
of
the
order
is
that
the
originals
can
be
kept
for
inspection
only
for
a
reasonable
time,
because
that's
what
7605(a)
says,
then
the
court
retains
authority
to
see
whether
we
have
exceeded
that
implied
condition
in
his
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
because
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
would
be
an
implied
condition
that
would
contradict
the
overall
pattern
of
statute
and
decision
law
concerning
judicial
anticipation
and
direction
of
internal
revenue
service
investigations.
i
think
the
answer
to
this
case
emerges
with
greater
clarity
if
we
put
the
particular
summons
enforcement
question
into
the
landscape
in
which
the
summons
authority
is
placed.
there
is...
throughout
the
u.s.
code,
there's
a
thematic
pattern
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
its
decisions
repeatedly,
and
that
is
that
congress
has,
with
only
very
narrowly
delimited
exceptions,
prohibited
preassessment
litigation
about
tax
controversies
because
that
litigation
could
interfere
with
the
service's
investigatory
and
collection
efforts.
there's
the
tax
anti-injunction
act.
there's
the
tax
exception
to
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
and
there
are
these
comprehensive
provisions
governing
disclosure
of
confidential
information
in
the
hands
of
the
irs
in
section
6103,
which
is
very
elaborate
and
detailed
with
many
subsections.
and
this
applies
to
a
very
broadly
defined
return
information
which
includes
any
data
collected
by
the
secretary
with
respect
to
a
return
or
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
the
existence
or
possible
existence
of
liability
under
the
code.
so,
it
would
apply
to
information
received
through
summons
enforcement
proceedings
or
received
through
voluntary
compliance
with
a
summons
without
any
court
order
or
otherwise
received
by
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--without
a
court
order
in
the
first
place,
you
said--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--turned
over
by
voluntary
compliance.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
answer
would
be
that
he
could
sue
for
a
violation
of
his
rights
to
get
his
property
back
the
way
he
would
from
any
other
agency
of
the
government
that
property
has
wrongfully
been
withheld.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's
no
particular
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
would
have
to...
he
would
have
to
do
that
and
bring
a
federal
question
case
and
come
within
the
very
narrow
exception
to
the
tax
anti-injunction
act
that
this
court
has
recognized.
the
leading
case
is
enochs
against
williams
packing
company,
370
u.s.
1,
a
standard
that
was
articulated
with
great
care.
if
it's
clear
that
under
no
circumstances
could
the
government
ultimately
prevail
under
the
most
liberal
view
of
the
law
and
the
facts,
then
there
is
this
narrow
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act,
which
the
court
reaffirmed
that
standard
in
commissioner
against
shapiro
in
volume
424
u.s.,
and
that
would
be
the
only
avenue.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
nothing
more
than
that
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
can
only
examine
them
for
a
reasonable
time,
but
we
can
during
that
time
and,
of
course,
in
the
modern
practice,
make
copies
of
them.
or
in
some
instances,
records
are
now
on
computers,
and
we
just
get
a
printout
that
they
don't
even
want
back.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
and
the
controversy
now
is
about
getting
us
to
turn
over
the
copies
that
we
made.
the
copies
were
not
anyone
else's
property.
they
are
a
form
of
fruits
of
the
original
disclosure.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
were
and
they
dealt
with
the
originals.
i
don't
know
whether
they
also
dealt
with
copies,
but
i
know
they
dealt
with
the
originals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
did
not
because,
as
i
recall,
we
had
not
even
made
copies
at
that
point,
as
we
explained
in
our
brief.
so,
whether
the
order
would
have
addressed
copies
or
not,
there
were
no
copies
to
be
turned
over.
and
our
view...
we've
set
this
forth
in
a
footnote...
is
that
the
proceeding
had
not
become
moot
at
that
point
because
this
wasn't
full
production
until
we
had
an
opportunity
to
examine
and
use
the
materials.
so--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
copies
are
not
to
be...
we
recognize
no
obligation
to
return
copies
to
anyone.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
copies
are
not
anyone
else's
property.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
of
course,
we
don't
for
our
own
purposes
do
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
that
is
correct,
as
well
as
anything
else
that
we
have
learned
in
our
investigation
as
a
result
of
having
scrutinized
the
originals,
whether
we
made
copies
or
not.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
copies
like
notes
or
like
further--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
answer
is
yes.
copies
like
notes
or
like
further
inquiries
that
we
made
on
the
basis
of
scrutinizing
the
original
are
a
species
of
fruits.
they
are
not
the
original
materials
that
were
produced.
in
their
reply
brief
in
support
of
their
petition,
what
petitioners
emphasize...
and
i'm
reading
from
their
reply
brief
at
the
top
of
page
4.
effective
relief
is
available
to
the
church
here
by
way
of
an
order
that
the
tapes
and
any
documents
derived
from
the
tapes
be
returned
to
the
custody
and
control
of
the
district
court,
and
that
any
information
derived
therefrom
not
be
further
disclosed
to
any
other
person
or
otherwise
used
by
the
irs
which
would
effectively
return
the
parties
to
the
status
quo
ante.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
that
it
was
all
res
judicata,
but
as
i
said,
we
argued
that
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
they
didn't
reach
that
argument
because
they
accepted
our
other
argument,
that
the
contention
was
moot.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that...
they
do...
there
is
a
controversy
asserted
between
the
parties.
our
position
is
that
that
controversy
is
not
right,
that
that
is
a
premature
claim,
as
this
court
said
in
the
g.m.
leasing
claim.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
the
mootness
issue.
they
say
that
that's--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--exactly.
they
say
that
that's--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
but
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
is
the
mootness
question.
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
in
our
view
agreed
with
all
other
circuits
except
the
third
by
saying
that
once
production
had
occurred
under
this
summons
enforcement
order,
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding
was
ended,
and
therefore
the
case
is
moot
regardless
of
the
merits
of
these
claims.
the
only
reason
to
reach--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
merits
if
they're
correct
on
mootness.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
were
restrictions
on
use
in
this
order
that
this
court
upheld
by
an
equally
divided
court
last
time
around,
united
states
against
zolin.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
now,
they're
asking
for
further
relief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
our
res
judicata
point,
but
that's
not
our
argument
to
this
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
not
a
form
of
relief
open
to
the
district
court
sitting
in
a
summons
enforcement
proceeding,
and
therefore
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding,
which
is
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
before
it,
is
moot.
that
is
correct.
that
is
our
position,
and
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
because
there's
no
statutory
requirement
that
the
government
return
copies
or
other
fruits
of
the
disclosure
after
the
disclosure
has
occurred.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
question
before
you
is
whether
that
contention
can
be
made
in
a
summons
enforcement
proceeding
after
the
records
have
been
produced,
whether
that
proceeding
can
extend
to
monitoring
of
the
irs'
investigation
by
requiring
that
what
the
irs
has
learned
from
the
production
be
expunged
from
the
irs'
records
in
one
way
or
another.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
one
could
decide
it
except
there
is
no
statutory
basis
for
it
as
there
is
for
return
of
the
originals
after
a
reasonable
time--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
7605(a).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
said
it's
implied
because
of
the...
it's
implied
in
the
order
because
it's
express
in
the
statute.
it's
not
implied
in
the
statute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
does
not.
it
has
returned
the
originals.
that's
what
this--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
can't
tell
you
precisely.
i
don't
even
know
if
the
record
even
shows
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
we
had
nothing
but
the
originals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
we
returned
them.
we
hadn't
made
the
copies
at
that
point.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
made
them
later
after
we
got
the
records
on
this
last
go-around
from
the
district
court.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
then
we
got
them
back
in
this
latest
round
at
the
district
court.
all
of
these
details
about
the
case
really
only
obscure
what
is
the
legal
question,
which
is
whether,
as
we
contend,
the
limited
jurisdiction
given
to
the
district
courts
to
decide
under
the
statutory
language
that
we
have
set
out
on
page
15
of
our
brief
at
the
top
to
decide
whether
to
compel
production
in
whole
or
in
part
or
to
deny
production,
extends
to
something
beyond
doing
what
the
statute
says,
issuing
an
order
about
whether
the
records
should
or
should
not
be
produced
depending
on
whether
we've
made
the
showing
required
in
powell.
this
is
a
summary
proceeding.
both
this
court
and
congress
have
said
it's
a
summary
preemptory
proceeding
that
is
just
used
because
the
summons
is
not,
like
most
administrative
summonses
are
not,
self-executing,
self--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
think
it's
really
the
same.
it
amounts
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
as
i
started
to
explain,
to
some
extent,
to
the
extent
that
it
doesn't
contradict
other
provisions
of
the
code.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
and
there
were
conditions
imposed
here
which
were
upheld
by
the
court.
we're
not
quarreling
with
that
at
this
point,
although
we
do
in
other
cases.
we
think
that
the
code
itself
has
a
system
of
remedies
for
improper
disclosures
and
specifies
what
disclosures
and
for
what
purposes
may
be
made
with
elaboration
about
redactions
and
the
like.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
retains
jurisdiction
to
enforce
its
order.
we
admit
that.
other
than
that,
the
court...
the
proceeding
is
over
once
production
has
occurred
pursuant
to
the
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
as
i
said,
because
of
7605,
we
can
only
inspect
originals
that
belong
to
the
person
on
whom
we've
served
the
summons
for
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
so,
that
could
be
an
implied
in
law
condition
in
the
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
the
case
would
have
been
moot
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
merits
of
the
production
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i'm
taking
your
hypothetical.
the
materials
were
produced.
that
made
the
case
moot
except
for
enforcement
of
the
district
court's
order.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
can
take
an
appeal
if
he
thinks
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--district
court
has
misconstrued
his
order
and
is
erring
in
not
enforcing
it
properly.
and
that
would
become
something
of
a
legal
question
rather
than
a
question
about
the
particular
order
if
the
provision
being
enforced
is
one
implied
by
law.
but,
of
course,
stays
are
available.
the
issue
in
the
stay
here
was--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--whether
the
case
would
become
moot.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
the
end
of
this
proceeding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
summons
enforcement
case
is
moot
except
for
enforcing
the
order
compelling
the
summons.
if
the
materials
were
voluntarily
given
over,
there
has
to
be
an
original
proceeding
brought
that
is
within
the
enochs
against
williams
packing
exception
to
the
tax
anti-injunction
act.
that's
the
only
way
to
do
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
don't
think
restrictions
on
use
are
proper
to
be
posed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
some
of
the
cases
we
have
cited
in
our
lengthy
footnote
about
the
tax
anti-injunction
act
were
ones
that
said
that
attempts
to
get
restrictions
on
use
were
not
within
the
enochs
against
williams
packing
company
exception.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
or
until
proceedings
are
brought
against
him,
which
is
the
time
to
move--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--for
suppression--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--under
this
court's
jurisprudence
and
not
in
an
anticipatory
way
getting
the
courts
in
to
supervise
and
delay
the
conduct
of
irs
investigations
and
collections.
that's
what
congress
has
said...
it
should
not
be
done.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
happens
to
be
res
judicata
in
this
case.
that's
correct.
and
i
would
have
a
lot
of
basis
for
saying
it.
