justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
were
the
copies
returned
to
the
taxpayer
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
it's
not
clear
that
it
was
moot.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
you
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
you
go
back?
am
i
wrong
in
my
understanding
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
already
ruled
that
the
crime
fraud
exception
applies
to
the
conversations
in
question
and
that,
therefore,
the
documents
have
to
be
turned
over?
am
i
wrong
in
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
why
isn't...
you
acknowledge
that
any
implicit
terms
of
the
order
can
be
enforced
by
subsequent
action
of
the
court.
why
isn't
a
reasonable
implicit
term
of
an
order
to
produce
that
if
i,
the
district
judge,
am
wrong
about
my
decision
that
these
documents
must
be
produced,
why
of
course
the
government
will
return
them
and
all
copies
of
them,
since
they
shouldn't
have
had
them
in
the
first
place?
why
isn't
that
a
reasonably
implicit
term?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
that,
but
that's
why
it's
implicit.
i
acknowledge
there's
no
explicit
statutory
requirement,
but
isn't
it
fairly
implicit?
if
i
may
just
add
a
further
note
to
that,
that's
the
question
before
us,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
what
about
the
originals?
suppose
on
appeal
the
appellate
court
found
it
was
wrong
to
compel
the
production
of
the
originals.
do
you
contest
that
the
district
court
can
require
the
originals
to
be
returned?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
no.
i'm
not
talking
about
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
it's
still
a
reasonable
period
of
time.
there's
a
really
quick
appeal.
it's
still
a
reasonable...
well
within
the
reasonable
period
of
time
for
the
irs
to
hold
them,
but
they've
been
wrongly
required
to
be
produced,
and
the
court
of
appeals
tells
the
district
court
you
did...
you
made
a
mistake.
can
the
court
of
appeals
get
them...
require
them
to
be
given
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
take
my
hypothetical,
mr.
wallace--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
how
i've
given
it
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
cannot
even
get
the
originals
back.
so,
it's
no
use
taking
an
appeal
then,
i
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
know,
there
are
other
areas
of
the
law
where
you...
you're
compelled
to
stand
on
your
rights.
if
you
want
to
challenge
the
government
action,
you
have
to
do
it
right
then
and
there,
take
your
chances.
that's
not
unheard
of.
why
isn't
this...
why
isn't
that
appropriate
here
in
this
area,
where
congress
has
displayed
great
sensitivity
about
staying
the
process
of
tax
collection?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
had
forgotten
that.
