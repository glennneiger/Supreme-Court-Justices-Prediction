justice
david
h.
souter
could
the
ninth
circuit
then
in
this
case,
instead
of
dismissing
on
mootness
grounds,
simply
say
the
taxpayer
has
had
an
opportunity
to
raise
any
further
objections?
it
has
not.
the
crime
fraud
exception,
therefore,
is
dispositive
and
we
have
already
ruled
on
the
case
and,
therefore,
hold
against
you
on
that
ground.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
think
you're
correct,
but
the
ninth
circuit
had
held
against
you.
and
could
they
simply
have
said
you
have
raised
no
new
evidentiary
issue.
there
is
no
investigation,
in
fact.
i
suppose
the
simple
way
to
do
it
is
that
the
investigation
is
over.
there's
no
evidentiary
issue
to
raise.
the
only
possibility
for
them
to
bar
the
irs
from
getting
this
was
crime
fraud
exception.
we've
already
ruled
on
it.
they've
lost.
we
hold
against
them
on
the
grounds
that
we've
already
decided
the
only
remaining
issue.
could
they
have
done
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
would
have
been
right,
wouldn't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
those...
weren't
those
questions
about
evidentiary
use?
maybe
i'm
not
remembering
accurately.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
investigation
is
over.
there's
not
going
to
be
any
issue.
if
the
investigation
is
over,
there's
not
going
to
be
any
further
issue
of
evidentiary
use
unless
there's
a
new
investigation,
i
suppose.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
never
was
in
the
sense
that
you
claim...
and
perhaps
rightly...
that
there
was
no
such
objection
that
could
have
been
raised,
but
the
ninth
circuit
at
least
left
it
open.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
wallace,
leaving
aside
the
question
of
whether
that
argument
should
succeed
or
not,
are
they
barred
from
raising
it
below?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
not
moot
if,
in
fact,
they
may
raise
this
issue.
so,
are
you
saying
that
the
mootness
issue
necessarily
subsumed
this
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
no.
i
recognize
that
as
being
your
position,
but
so
far
as
their
opportunity
to
raise
that
issue
and
for
you
to
assert
that
position
now,
you're
saying
that
the
mootness
determination
necessarily
subsumed
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
that's
properly...
so,
that's
properly
before
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
we
think
that
issue
ought
to
be
explored,
we
could
remand
for
that
purpose.
justice
david
h.
souter
couldn't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
couldn't
we
say
that
they
were
entitled
to
explore
that
on
the
merits
before
the
ninth
circuit
and
they
were
not
allowed
to
do
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
did
they...
excuse
me,
chief.
no,
i
was
going...
did
they
specifically
make
the
argument
below
about
the...
about
legitimate
restrictions
on
use
that
a
court
could
enforce
against
you,
or
did
they
attempt
to
make
that
argument
below?
justice
david
h.
souter
were
they
the
same
rescrictions
that
they're
talking
about
now?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
so,
you're
saying
they
should
have
raised
any
request
for
restriction
the
first
time
around,
and
that
goes
back
to
your
argument
they
can't
raise
these
things
seriatim.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
we
could
properly
decide
the
case
based
on
justice
scalia's
suggestion.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
might
be
for
return
of
property.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
is
that
going
to
be
broad
enough
to
allow
for
restrictions
on
use?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
agree...
certainly
you
don't
think
there
should
be
any
restrictions
on
use,
but
if
a
taxpayer
wants
to
raise
it,
can
he
at
least
have
a
shot
at
raising
it
by
the
process
you
describe?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
therefore,
if
that's
the
law,
he
will
never
have
an
opportunity
to
raise
a
restriction
on
use
unless
he,
in
effect,
refuses
to
turn
it
over,
unless
the
government
agrees
to
such
a
restriction.
justice
david
h.
souter
for
involuntary--
justice
david
h.
souter
--right.
