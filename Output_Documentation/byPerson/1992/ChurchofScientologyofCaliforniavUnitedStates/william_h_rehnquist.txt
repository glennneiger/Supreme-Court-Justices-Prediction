we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-946,
church
of
scientology
of
california
v.
united
states
and
frank
s.
zolin.
mr.
lieberman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
the
district
court
wouldn't
consider
it,
and
you
say
it
has
happened
since
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
in
this
case
that
we're
hearing
now--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
certainly
does.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
relief
could
the
ninth
circuit
have
granted
you
had
it
heard
your
appeal
on
the
merits?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
good
would
that
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they
have
the
documents,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
documents
wouldn't
go
to
you.
they'd
go
to
the
clerk
of
the
superior
court
of
los
angeles
county,
wouldn't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
good
would
that
have
done
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
after
they've
already
copied
what
they
want
to
copy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
to
say
to
return
the
copies
as
well
suggests
that
you
want
an
order
precluding
their
use
in
any
future
proceedings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
in
sells,
the
court
said
we
can
prevent
future
disclosure
or
further
disclosure.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
you
should
be
clearer
than
you
were
when
you
just
described
sells.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
further
disclosures
within
the
justice
department.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you're
talking
about
something
that
is
going
to
happen
in
the
future.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
continuing
access.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
not
in
the
past.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so,
what
good
is
an
order
like
that
to
say
that
the
irs
shall
not
further
look
at
your
copies,
which
perhaps
would
be
the
counterpart
of
the
sells
order?
what
good
is
that
going
to
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
complaint
in
sells
was
that
these
people
were
disclosing
things
among
themselves,
and
that
it
would
keep
right
on
going.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suggest
you
try
to
be
more
accurate,
counsel,
in
your
description
of
the
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
just
another
argument
on
the
merits,
isn't
it?
the...
you're
saying
the
district
court's
order
of
disclosure
was
wrong.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
an
argument
why
this
case
isn't
moot.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
addressing
the
merits
of
your
argument--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--for
reversal
of
the
district
court
order.
mr.
lieberman,
if
the
investigation
is
over,
can
members
of
the
public
gain
access
to
these
copies,
do
you
suppose?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lieberman.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
what
does
the...
what
does
the
statute
requiring
production
for
the
irs...
does
it
say
anything
more
than
that
the
taxpayer
shall
produce
certain
books?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
that
can't
contemplate
that
the
property
interests
in
the
books
turns...
goes
over
to
the
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
originals
of
these
records
have
been
returned
to
where
they
got
them
from--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--which
is
the
clerk
of
the
superior
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
recognize
that.
well,
your
position
with
respect
to
one
of
these
issues,
mr.
wallace,
is
that,
i
take
it,
that
since
you
cannot,
under
g.m.
leasing,
forbid
future
use
in
yet
unbrought
proceedings,
that
is
not
a
form
of
relief
which
they
could
obtain
that
would
do
them
any
good
to
prevent
them
from
being
moot.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
to
get
a
stay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
lieberman,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lieberman.
the
case
is
submitted.
