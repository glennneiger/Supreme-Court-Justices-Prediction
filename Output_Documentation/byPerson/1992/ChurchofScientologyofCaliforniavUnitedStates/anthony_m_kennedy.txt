justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
did
not
take...
certiorari
was
not
granted
from
that
order.
that
order
is
final.
that's
the
june
20
order,
and
that
is
final.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
it's
the
law
of
the
case
that
the
court
is
not
going
to
consider
these
transcripts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
isn't
that
the
problem?
you
didn't
even
raise
it
in
your
original
appeal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
these
transcripts
just
duplicate
copies
of
the
materials
that
are...
the
principal
materials
in
issue?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
everything
in
the
transcript
was
covered
by
the
documents
themselves,
and
we've
said
you
can
look
at
the
documents
themselves
in
order
to
determine
the
privilege.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
another
reason
this
case
is
over
no
matter
what
we
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
an
explanation
for
the
objections
that
the
ninth
circuit
won't
hear
it...
heard
it.
the
order
is
at
page
15a
of
your
appendix,
and
i
agree
that
it's
imprecise.
but
it
seems
to
me
the
best
reading
of
it
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
thought
that
these
were
going
to
be
admitted
into
evidence
and
said
if
you
have
any
other
evidentiary
objections,
you
can
make
those
objections.
but
so
far
as
the
crime
fraud
exception,
we've
ruled.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
most
plausible
reading
of
the
order.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
our
problem
is
that
if
we're
going
to
discuss
mootness,
we
should
undertake
some
analysis
of
the
remedies
that
might
be
available
below,
and
in
this
case,
it
doesn't
look
like
the
petitioner
is
going
to
prevail
in
any
event.
and
so,
it's
just
an
awkward
posture
to
hear
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
statute
says
that
the
court
exercises
its
jurisdiction
by
appropriate
process.
is
your
position
that
that
is
narrower
than
if
it
said
by
appropriate
order,
or
is
that
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
by
appropriate
order,
wouldn't...
if
we
can
interpolate
that
with
your
consent,
would
that
not
indicate
that
the
court
can
use
its
discretion
in
protecting
the
interest
of
the
owner
of
the
documents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
just
as
a
condition
to
their
being
produced.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
the
court
could
make
all
of
those
orders
in
conjunction
with
the
production
order,
surely
it
could
retain
jurisdiction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
did
they
have--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--did
they
have
copies
of
each
and
every
document?
