justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
is
it
that
so
many
courts
of
appeals
haven't
really
caught
on
to
this
argument
of
yours?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
are
only
10
of
them,
aren't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
they
haven't
analyzed
it
like
you
have.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
i
take
you
literally,
every
single
case
was
like
the
fifth
circuit
case;
namely,
the
documents
had
been
returned.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
what
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--all
right.
how
about
the
other
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
don't
you
just
say
that
the
case
can't
possibly
be
moot
since
at
least
the
original
of
the
tapes
is
your
property?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whatever--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
so,
you
have
no
right
to
the
copy
unless
you
win
the...
this
case
on
your
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
just
some
imaginary
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
it
going
to
hurt
your
clients
if
the
investigation
is
all
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
exhausted
your
remedies
below
to
get
these
papers
back
now
that
the
investigation
is
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
has
happened
since
the
investigation
is
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
have
you
asked
for
the
papers
back
where
you
say,
look,
the
investigation
is
over,
and
you've
made
copies
of
our
papers,
and
we
have
an
interest
in
getting
them
back?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
government
doesn't
have
the
original
anymore
anyway,
does
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
when
did
you
make
the
copies?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
the
second
time...
the
second
time
that
the
government
was
ordered
to
return
the
documents,
on
march
13
the
district
court
ordered
that
any
copies
of
the
tapes
and
any
notes
or
transcripts
in
possession
of
the
government
be
returned
to
the
district
court.
on
march
14,
1991,
the
government
complied
with
that
order.
did
they
comply
with
that
order?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
the
copies--
justice
byron
r.
white
--oh,
when
did
you
make
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
at
the
time
of
this
order,
the
original
had
already
been
returned,
i
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
does
one
ever
enforce
against
the
government
the
obligation
to
return
the
original
within
a
reasonable
time?
the
case
is
moot.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
to
wait
in
this
case
wouldn't
do
them
any
good
because
it's
res
judicata.
justice
byron
r.
white
when?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
had
copies
at
the
time
the...
that
the
district
court
ordered
them
to
return
the
copies.
justice
byron
r.
white
had
they
had
copies
at
the
time
the
district
court
first
ordered
them
to
return?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet,
the
government
never
claimed
the
case
was
moot
at
that
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
the
government
is
just
wrong
in
saying
that
they
didn't
have
copies.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
we
know
that?
