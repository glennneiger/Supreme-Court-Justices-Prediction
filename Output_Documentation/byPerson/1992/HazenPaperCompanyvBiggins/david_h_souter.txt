justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
it
may
be
wrong
to
equate
it
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
it
is
not
wrong
to
consider
it
as
conceivably...
or,
strike
conceivably.
to
consider
it
as
possibly
relevant
evidence.
do
you
agree
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
let's
just
consider
liability
here.
it
could
be
relevant
evidence
on
liability,
couldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
issue
is
entirely
framed
by
your
motion
for
judgment
nop.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
it
do
it
in
disparate
impact
as
opposed
to
disparate
treatment
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it
doesn't
do
it
in
disparate
impact
cases,
then
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
is
gone
that
as
a
practical
matter
the
application
of
thurston
under
the
act
is
simply
providing
an
almost
automatic
enhancement
in
every
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
basically
your
answer
to
the
argument
from
the
other
side
that
there's
still
a
two-tier
system
is
that
the
lower
tier
is
so
minuscule
that
it
could
not
have
been
within
the
contemplating
of
congress
as
sufficient.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
i
take
it
correctly
from
your
brief,
mr.
dunne,
that
your
response
to
the
argument
that
as
a
practical
matter
this
will
mean
that
in
any
disparate
treatment
case
there
will
always
be
the
liquidated
damages,
that
your
response
to
that
basically
is,
yes,
so
be
it?
that's--
