justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
you
can
use
one...
must
you
not
acknowledge
that
you
can
use
some
other
factors
as
surrogates
for
age,
where
the
substitution
is
obvious,
such
as
you
fire
everybody
who
has
gray
hair,
or
fire
everybody
with
wrinkles.
wouldn't
that
violate
the
age
discrimination
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
and
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
take
it
you
have
no
objection
to
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
were
they
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
something
like
an
old
duffer
like
you
wouldn't
need
the
handball
court,
or
something
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
willful
is
a
strange
term
to
represent
all
of
the
things
that
you've
just
mentioned.
i
mean,
i
can
see
how
it
might
represent
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
statute,
or
something
like
that,
but
how
could
it
represent
singling
the
defendant
out,
or
repeated
violations?
i
mean,
it's
either
willful
or
it's
not
willful.
you
can
be
willful
repetitive,
or
willful
one
shot.
i
don't
know
how
willful
bears
on
any
of
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
it
enough
to
say
that
willful
means
that
you
know
you're
violating
adea?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
mandate
it.
it
would
allow
the
jury
to
find
it.
i
mean,
the
mere
fact
that
age
discrimination
does
violate
adea
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
when
committing
age
discrimination
the
person
adverts
to
it.
he
may
not
advert
to
it,
but
you
can
have
a
conversation
that
shows,
look,
let's
cover
this
up,
because
it's
in
violation
of
federal
law.
that's
willful.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
your
last
remark
indicates
what
the
problem
is.
the
more
we're
willing
to
accept
your
position
on
how
easy
it
is
to
establish
age
discrimination,
the
truer
it
is
that
everybody
who
commits
it
is
not
necessarily
willful.
that
is
to
say,
you
say
bfoq.
i
think
the
other
side
would
say
there's
no
such
thing
as
age
discrimination
using
a
surrogate,
so
you
don't
even
have
to
talk
about
a
bona
fide
occupational
qualification.
unless
you
actually
intend
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
age,
the
other
side
says,
there's
no
liability.
now,
you
don't
accept
that,
but
if
you
accepted
that
proposition,
then
i
think
you
would
probably
have
to
accept
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
you
can
establish
willfulness.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
he
was
the
only
one
asked
to
signed
this
confidentiality
agreement.
he
was
also
the
only
one
who...
as
far
as
the
record
shows,
that
had
in
the
view
of
the
owners
of
the
company
violated
confidentiality
in
the
past.
justice
antonin
scalia
and,
since
that's
the
case,
the
reason
they
wanted
to
get...
since
that
was
a
pretext,
it
therefore
becomes
clear
immediately
that
the
reason
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
was
that
he
was
too
old.
not
that
his
pension
was
about
to
vest...
leave
that
aside...
but
that
he
was
too
old.
why
would
that
ever
occur
to
anybody...
just
because
of
the
two
remarks
during
10
years
of
employment
that
were
described
earlier?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
he
was
being
treated
differently
on
the
basis...
why
on
the
basis
of
age?
he
was
being
asked
to
sign
that
agreement.
now,
the
jury
disbelieves
that
the
reason
he
was
asked
to
sign
it
was
because
they
believed
he
had
been
disloyal,
okay.
the
jury
disbelieves
that.
why
does
the
jury
leap
to
the
conclusion
from
that
that
therefore
the
reason
they
did
it
was
because
of
his
age?
what
evidence
is
there
that
it
was
his
age?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
leave
out
the
pension.
suppose
i
don't
think
that
that
works.
what
is
there
besides
the
pension?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
fact
that
he
was
given
far
more
favorable
treatment
doesn't
prove
anything,
but
you
got
something
there.
he
was
replaced
by
somebody
younger,
and
you
think
that's
enough.
whenever
you
fire
somebody
and
replace
him
with
somebody
younger,
that's
evidence
of
age
discrimination--
justice
antonin
scalia
--enough
to
support
a
verdict.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
their
account
of
the
thing
i...
well,
i
don't
know.
if
a
jury
is
assumed
to
disagree
with
their
account.
their
account
was
that
the
reason
he
was
terminated
was
that
he
would
not
sign
this
agreement,
and
therefore
in
a
way
he
brought
it
on
himself.
that
was
their
position
in
the
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
said,
we'll
keep
you
on
if
you'll
sign
this
agreement.
he
said,
i
won't
sign
this
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
the
objection
point.
if
evidence
is
admissible
for
one
purpose
but
not
for
another,
do
you
have
to
make
an
objection
or
ask
for
a
limiting
instruction
before
you
can
say
that
there's
not
enough
evidence
to
support
the
jury
verdict?
i
don't
know
that
that's
a
rule
of
law.
it
seems
to
me
there
has
to
be
enough
evidence,
period,
whether
you
objected
to
its
entrance
or
not.
even
if
it
was
not
relevant
for
any
purpose,
and
you
let
it
get
in
irrelevantly,
so
what?
it's
your
burden
to
have
enough
evidence
there
in
the
record
to
support
the
jury
verdict,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
you
mean,
everything
you
let
in
without
objection
must
be
considered
to
be
evidence
that
is
valid
evidence
against
you,
even
if
it
isn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly,
you
can't
appeal
giving
the
jury
an
opportunity
to
consider
it,
i
suppose,
but
if
that
is
the
only
evidence
supporting
the
verdict,
you
can
still
say
there
is
no
evidence
supporting
the
verdict,
can't
you?
those
are
two
separate
questions...
objection
to
admissibility
and
review
of
the
evidence
to
see
if
it's
sufficient
to
support
the
verdict.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
contributing
factor?
i
mean,
is
a
contributing
factor
if
you
want
to
fire
him
in
order
not
to
have
to
pay
him
his
pension,
and
it
so
happens
he
hasn't
quite
reached
his
pension
yet
but
he's
close
to
it
because
he's
older,
does
that
make
age
a
contributing
factor?
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
fired
him
because
he
was
close
to
vesting
in
his
retirement
fund--
--to
save
money.
you
get
close
to
vesting
by
getting
older...
by
being
there
longer,
which
means
by
getting
older.
does
that
make
age
a
contributing
factor?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
like,
i
want
to
avoid
having
to
pay
the
pension,
and
besides,
he's
62
years
old--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
not
sure
there's
a
good
faith
exception.
you
intentionally
discriminated
on
the
basis
of
age
in
good
faith.
i
don't
see
how
there
could
be
a
good
faith
exception.
