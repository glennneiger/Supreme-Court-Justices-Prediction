justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
his
case,
the
payments
would
commence
almost
coterminously...
or,
concomitantly
with
the
vesting,
would
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
could
begin
at
once.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
a
trial
court
would
be
required
to
sustain
an
objection
to
the
evidence
in
an
adea
trial,
especially
when
his
payments
are
going
to
begin
at
once.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or,
as
soon
as
he
retires.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
ask
the
trial
court
to
instruct
the
jury
that
the
evidence
of
the
pension
was
irrelevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
object
to
the
admission
of
the
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
for
purposes
of
this
case
at
least
the
statutes...
if
a
statute
said,
there
shall
be
liquidated
damage
for
a
knowing
violation,
that
would
be
the
same
result
as,
there
should
be
liquidated
damage
for
a
willful
violation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
purposes
of
this
case,
at
least
synonymous.
