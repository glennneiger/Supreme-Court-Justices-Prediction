but
if
we
agree
that
the
only
proof
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
discharge
was
to
prevent
the
vesting
of
the
pension,
how
can
that
be
enough
to
sustain

well,
that
may
be,
but
if
that's
all
there
was--
justice
sandra

--and
do
you
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
place
heavy
emphasis
on
that
factor
here?

the
second
case
is
hazen
paper
company
against
biggins
which
comes
to
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
respondent
was
employed
by
petitioner
hazen
paper
company.
he
was
fired
when
he
was
62
years
old.
he
brought
suit
against
the
petitioners
and
federal
district
court
claiming
that
he
had
received
discriminatory
treatment
under
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
of
1967.
the
jury
found
in
respondent's
favor
and
also
found
that
the
petitioners
had
committed
a
willful
violation
of
the
statute.
under
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act,
a
willful
violation
gives
rise
to
liquidated
damages.
petitioners
move
for
judgment
not
withstanding
the
verdict.
the
district
court
granted
the
motion
with
respect
to
the
finding
of
willfulness.
the
court
of
appeals
upheld
the
verdict
of
liability,
giving
emphasis
to
the
evidence
that
petitioners
had
fired
the
respondent
in
order
to
prevent
his
pension
benefits
from
vesting.
on
the
issue
of
willfulness,
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
standard
set
out
in
trans
world
airlines
against
thurston
and
reversed
the
judgment
not
withstanding
the
verdict.
we
hold
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
that
an
employer
does
not
commit
discriminatory
treatment
under
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
by
firing
an
employee
whose
pension
benefits
are
about
to
vest,
where
vesting
is
linked
to
the
employee's
years
of
service.
the
act
generally
prohibits
employment
decisions
based
on
the
employee's
age,
not
decisions
based
on
factors
that
are
analytically
distinct
from
age,
such
as
years
of
service.
congress
passed
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
because
employers
were
relying
on
inaccurate
and
stigmatizing
stereotypes
about
age.
pension
interference
violates
the
act
known
as
erisa,
the
employees
income
and
retirement
act,
but
it
does
not
amount
to
discriminatory
treatment
under
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act.
on
the
issue
of
willfulness,
we
hold
that
the
thurston
definition
is
generally
applicable
to
discriminatory
treatment
cases
under
that
act.
thurston
held
that
a
violation
of
the
act
would
be
willful
if
the
employer
knew
or
showed
reckless
disregard
for
the
matter
of
whether
its
conduct
was
prohibited
by
the
act.
we
see
no
relevant
difference
between
an
employer
who
has
a
formal
policy
that
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
age,
which
was
the
case
in
thurston,
and
an
employer
who
makes
an
informal
decision
that
is
motivated
by
the
employee's
age.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
thomas
have
joined.
