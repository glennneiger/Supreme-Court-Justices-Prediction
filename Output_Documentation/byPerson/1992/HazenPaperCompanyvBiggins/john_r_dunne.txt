mr.
john
r.
dunne
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
there
is
no
need
to
modify
or
qualify
the
definition
of
willfulness
as
set
forth
in
thurston.
a
reaffirmation
of
that
clear
standard
will
not
subvert
the
intent
of
congress,
and
to
do
otherwise
would
impose
an
unreasonable
burden
of
proof
upon
an
individual
victim
of
discrimination.
in
a
disparate
treatment
case,
there
are
two
entirely
separate
factual
inquiries.
they
are,
simply
stated,
what
were
the
grounds
for
the
employer's
action,
and,
if
age
was
one,
did
the
employer
know
or
just
not
care
that
it
violated
the
law?
the
liability
inquiry--
mr.
john
r.
dunne
--if
the
jury
concludes
that
it
was
a
factor
contributing
to
or
determining
the
employment
decision
made
by
the
employer,
that
is
sufficient
to
find
liability.
mr.
john
r.
dunne
a
series
of
cases,
as
indicated,
that
if
it
is
a
contributing
factor
or
is
a
determining
factor--
mr.
john
r.
dunne
--i
believe
that
it
runs
through
thurston
as
well
as
in
richland,
that
that
is
a
factor...
that
is
a
principle
for
this
law.
mr.
john
r.
dunne
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
underlying--
mr.
john
r.
dunne
--age
discrimination
liability.
mr.
john
r.
dunne
that's
the...
that
is
the
so-called
tier
1
factual
determination.
tier
2
relates
to
the
issue
of
willfulness.
on
the
tier--
mr.
john
r.
dunne
--if
the
trier
of
the
fact
concludes
that
the
employer
factored
in
and
it
was
a
consideration
when
he
determined
to
discharge
the
person,
that
would
be
a
determining
factor.
mr.
john
r.
dunne
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
predominant--
mr.
john
r.
dunne
--not
necessarily--
mr.
john
r.
dunne
--but
if
the
jury
concludes
that
in
the
course
of
his
determination
whether
or
not
to
discharge
mr.
biggins
here,
did
it
enter
into
his
considerations...
not
that
it
was
just
hanging
out
there
and
it
was
a
coincidence,
but
that
it
was
actually
part
of
his
determination
in
making
up
his
mind
to
discharge.
mr.
john
r.
dunne
correct,
and--
mr.
john
r.
dunne
--he's
getting
along--
mr.
john
r.
dunne
--and
it's
that
sort
of
thinking
that
i
believe
motivated
the
congress
to
enact
this
legislation.
now,
the
tier
2
inquiry--
mr.
john
r.
dunne
--we
are
not
taking
the
position
that
it
alone
is
sufficient
to
find
the
underlying
discrimination.
we
figure...
we
believe
strongly
that
there
is
stronger
evidence
of
underlying
discrimination.
mr.
john
r.
dunne
if
that's
all
there
was,
as
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief,
that
it
appeared
that
the
court
of
appeals
overemphasized
that
factor,
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
remand
this
to
the
circuit
court
for
reevaluation,
whatever
this
court
might
hold.
mr.
john
r.
dunne
it
would
appear
from
a
fair
reading
of
their
decision,
yes,
they
singled
that
out
in
particular,
but
once
again,
it
would
appear
that
there's
simply
additional
strong
evidence
of
age
discrimination.
mr.
john
r.
dunne
that
finding
of
underlying--
mr.
john
r.
dunne
--not--
mr.
john
r.
dunne
--yes,
indeed--
mr.
john
r.
dunne
--indeed,
justice
white--
mr.
john
r.
dunne
--that
is
our
position.
mr.
john
r.
dunne
we
acknowledge
that
that
could
be
a
basis
for
denying
the
underlying
age--
mr.
john
r.
dunne
--discrimination
relief,
yes,
but
the
important
factor
to
be
considered
in
this
presentation
is
the
tier
2
inquiry,
which
does
not
talk
about
or
properly
consider
as
a
predominant
factor
the
age
discriminatory
conduct,
but
rather,
was
that
conduct
done
in
a
manner,
with
the
knowledge
that
it
violated
the
law?
that
is
what
is
the
touchstone
for
outrageousness,
and
we
believe
that
the
court
very
clearly
in
thurston,
reaffirmed
in
richland,
has
made
it
quite
clear
that
that
is
the
proper
consideration
here.
mr.
john
r.
dunne
that
is--
mr.
john
r.
dunne
--knowing,
or
the
reckless
disregard
for
knowledge,
yes,
that
is
our
position,
and
that...
and
when,
in
making
the
factual
inquiry
with
regard
to
whether
there
was
an
entitlement
to
liquidated
damages,
the
court
should
look
to
the
question
of
what
was
the
actor's
knowledge
at
the
time
he
engaged
in
these
discriminatory
acts.
i
think
that's
very
clear
from
a
reading
of
both
thurston
and
richland,
and
the
mischief,
if
you
will,
or
the
confusion
which
has
arisen
among
the
various
circuits
comes
from
having
tried
to
translate
the
underlying
conduct
to
meet
some
standard
in
order
to
determine
knowledge
of
what
the
law
was.
i
think
that's
the
very
point
that
was
made
by
this
court
in
thurston.
mr.
john
r.
dunne
no,
it
was
disparate
treatment.
mr.
john
r.
dunne
absolutely.
there
was...
it
was
facially
discriminatory
against
60-year-old
pilots.
mr.
john
r.
dunne
it
was...
yes,
it
was
a
policy,
a
policy
because
this
was
a
large
corporation
employing
thousands
of
people.
consider,
for
example...
the
argument
is
made,
well,
you
ought
to
treat
individual
treatment
cases
differently
than
a
group,
such
as
the
pilots.
supposing
thurston
had
been
working
for
a
small
airline
and
was
the
only
person
who
had
been
discriminated
against
by
a
policy,
whether
it's
a
big
corporation
or
otherwise.
there
is
no
reason,
either
in
looking
at
the
statute
or
in
the
cases,
which
would
suggest
that
harold
thurston,
had
he
been
a
lone
60-year-old
pilot
being
discriminated
against,
should
have
some
heavier
burden
in
order
to
establish
the
knowledge
of
twa
or
his
employer.
so
that
what
is
important
here
is
to
reaffirm
for
the
circuits
that
the
inquiry
with
regard
to
willfulness
relating
to
liquidated
damages,
not
using
the
standard
approach
for
punitive
damages...
these
are
only
punitive
nature...
that
the
inquiry
should
be,
what
was
the
extent
of
the
actor's
knowledge
when
he
made
this
employment
decision,
which
was
basically
discriminatory,
in
violation
of
the
statute?
mr.
john
r.
dunne
no,
the
answer
is
not
yes,
so
be
it,
most
respectfully,
justice
souter.
it
is...
as
the
circuit
court
observed,
it's
in
the
nature
of
the
beast
that
there
would
be
a
greater
incidence
of
the
award
of
liquidated
damages
in
discriminatory
treatment
cases.
however,
when
you
consider
that
there
are
all
kinds
of
alternative
means
for
getting
out
from
the
awarding
of
liquidated
damages...
a
good
faith
exception,
a
mistake,
an
exemption
under
the
statute,
such
as
was
pointed
out
in
both
twa,
thurston,
and
richland,
there's
ample
evidence
that
there
will
continue
to
be
preserved
what
this
court
called
for,
and
that
is,
a
two-tier
liability.
mr.
john
r.
dunne
oh,
well,
take
the
thurston
case.
twa
knowingly
issued
a
policy
which
discriminated
on
its
face,
knowingly
did,
against
60-year-old
pilots.
they
went
to
their
attorneys.
the
attorneys
said,
this
is
not
good,
change
it.
they
changed
it.
they
obtained
further
counsel
from
their
attorneys,
and
they
knew
that
they
were
discriminating,
but
they
thought
in
good
faith
that
their
action
constituted
an
exemption
from
the
statute.
so
there's
a
whole
panoply
of
opportunities
for
an
employer
to
show
that
despite
underlying
age
discrimination
conduct
he
should
be
exempt
from
the
liquidated
damages.
i
think
that's
an
important
factor,
and
i
think
as
this
court
observed
yesterday
in
the
roland
v.
california
case,
despite
the
fact
that
there
were
a
series
of
circuit
court
decisions
interpreting
the
statute
in
different
manners,
the
statute
clearly
did
not
provide
that
in
thurston.
the
congress
was
very
clear
when
it
said,
willfulness
is
the
standard,
not
the
standard
as
set
forth
as
this
court
did
under
1983.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
