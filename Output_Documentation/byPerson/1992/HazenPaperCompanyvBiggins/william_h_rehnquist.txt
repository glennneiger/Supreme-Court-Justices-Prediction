chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-1600,
the
hazen
paper
company
v.
walter
f.
biggins.
mr.
gordon,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gordon,
does
the
record
show
the
total
number
of
employees
at
the
hazen
paper
company?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
feeney
is
a
constitutional
case,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
might
not
there
be
a
different,
broader
definition
of
discrimination
under
title
vii
than
there
is
under
the
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not
sure
that's
correct,
mr.
gordon.
the
court
of
appeals
mentions
in
its
opinion
that
there
were
several
adverse
comments
made
by
the
employer
on...
is
it
biggins
age
+/?
and
that
the
fellow
who
replaced
him,
mcdonald,
was
given
a
much
more
generous
confidentiality
agreement
than
biggins
was
offered.
now,
certainly
that
tends
to
give
some
support
to
the
plaintiff's
case,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gordon.
mr.
cahillane,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
cahillane,
you
know,
reviewing
this
record
from
the
standpoint
of
an
appellate
court,
which
is
obviously
not
the...
i
would
find
it
very,
very
difficult
to
say
that
the
conduct
made
out
here
is
outrageous.
i
think
the
evidence
of
discrimination
is
extraordinarily
weak,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
not
have
been
right
in
what
it
did,
but
i
don't
think
your
strongest
point
certainly
is
that
this
was
outrageous
conduct,
because
i
think
many
people
would
disagree
with
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00
p.m.,
mr.
cahillane.
mr.
cahillane,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
a
motion...
was
a
motion
to
set
aside
the
judgment
on
the
basis
of
insufficient
evidence
made
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
that
raise
the
question,
was
there
sufficient
evidence
to
support
the
verdict?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cahillane.
mr.
dunne,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
dunne,
is
it
enough
for
a
finding
of
discrimination
that
age
was
a
factor,
perhaps
a
very
minor
factor?
that's
what
i
would
gather
from
your
statement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but...
excuse
me.
go
ahead.
no...
sorry.
what's
your
authority
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
you
tell
me
one
case
in
this
court
that
supports
that
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
thurston,
mr.
dunne,
wasn't
that
a
disparate
impact
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
disparate
treatment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dunne.
the
case
is
submitted.
