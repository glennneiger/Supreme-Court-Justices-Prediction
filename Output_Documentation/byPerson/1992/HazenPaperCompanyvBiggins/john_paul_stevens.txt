--mr.
gordon,
can
i
ask
you
a
hypothetical?
supposing
a
company
had
a
policy
of
hiring...
or
firing,
rather,
all
executives
with
17
years
of
seniority
because
it
would
be
cheaper
to
hire
young
men
to
replace
them...
employees
with
less
seniority
to
replace
them.
would
that
be
relevant
evidence
in
an
age
discrimination
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
are
pension
benefits
different
than
a
salary
scale
that's
associated
with
seniority
with
the
company?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
my
hypothesis.
it's
cheaper
to
hire
young
men
than
it
is--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what's
your...
what
authority
do
you
have
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
clear
from
the
record?
there's
a
lot
of...
i
had
some...
the
pension
agreement
isn't
in
the
record,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
i
thought...
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
may
i
just
interrupt?
if
the
plan
is
in
the
record,
why
can't
we...
and
we
know
the
day
this
man
was
hired--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
why
can't
we
compute
whether
it
was
6
hours...
he
was
fired
6
hours
before
it
vested,
or
8
months
before
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
so
the
10
years
is
a
proxy
for
hours...
a
certain
number
of
hours
of
service.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
would
be
permissible
under
the
statute
to
fire
all
your
people
for
whom
the
insurance
premiums
were
higher
because
they
were
older?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
this
remark
goes
right
to
the
heart
of
the
statute,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
comment
about,
it's
more
expensive
to
insure
you,
says,
in
effect,
because
of
your
age,
there
are
certain
reasons
why
we
wouldn't
want
you
in
our
employ,
doesn't
it?
