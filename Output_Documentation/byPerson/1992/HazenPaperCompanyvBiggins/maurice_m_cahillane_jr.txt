mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
respondent
submits
that
the
first
circuit
correctly
adopted
this
court's
previously
determined
definition
of
willfulness
in
thurston
and
properly
considered
the
evidence
concerning
mr.
biggins'
pension
status,
and
i
wish
to
first
address
why
the
thurston
definition
has
been
properly
applied
by
the
first
circuit
in
this
case,
and
then,
secondly,
why
the
pension
issue
as
presented
does
not
actually
appear
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
that,
even
if
it
did,
pension
interference
would
be
proper
evidence
of
age
discrimination.
with
respect
to
willfulness,
the
petitioners
are
effectively
asking
this
court
to
reverse
this
court's
definition
of
willfulness
set
down
in
twa
v.
thurston
and
in
mclaughlin
v.
richland
shoe
under
the
fsla,
the
definition
that
was
adopted
here
by
the
first
circuit
which
is
currently
adhered
to
by
a
majority
of
the
circuits
in
all
cases,
including
those
of
disparate
treatment.
that
definition
as
shown
by
thurston
is
consistent
with
the
statute's
plain
meaning,
it's
consistent
with
the
legislative
history,
and
it's
consistent
with
the
use
of
that
term
in
other
statutes
in
federal
law.
the
objection
that
is
raised
that
presumably
this
creates
automatic
double
damages
is
simply
not
the
case.
the
employer,
most
importantly,
always
has
the
opportunity
to
convince
the
jury
that
it
was
acting
in
a
good
faith
attempt
to
comply
with
the
law,
something
which
there
was
no
evidence
of
here.
in
addition
to
that,
the
employer
has
a
host
of
other
defenses
which
may
justify
actions
that
may
still
be
underlying
violations
such
as
a
legitimate
belief
on
the
employer's
part
that
there
was
a
bfoq,
or
that
he
was
exempt
from
the
act,
so
it's
simply
not
true
that
this
is
a
situation
of
automatic
double
damages.
but
where,
as
here,
the
employer
engages
in
an
intentional
and
purposeful
scheme
to
discriminate
against
someone
on
the
basis
of
their
age,
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
sought
to
shield
that
employer
from
what
is
a
very
limited
additional
remedy,
in
this
case
of
doubling
the
back
pay
award
that
the
plaintiff
would
otherwise
be
entitled
to.
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
your
honor,
we
don't
dispute
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
of
intentional
discrimination
it
will
be...
the
plaintiff
will
be
capable
of
establishing
willfulness.
however,
the
two-tier
structure
means
there's
also
a
two-tier
inquiry,
and
the
standard
for
the
second
tier
of
inquiry
can't
be
determined
by
the
standard
for
the
first
tier,
and
there's
simply
no
reason
to
believe
that
just
because
there
is
a
two-tier
structure,
that
that
somehow
tells
us
how
many
cases
congress
wanted
to
have
fall
into
which
category.
what
i
submit
that
we
should
do
is
simply
follow
the
language
that
congress
used,
follow
what
that
term
has
been
held
to
mean
before,
and
let
the
parties
argue
to
the
jury...
it's
a
factual
question...
as
to
whether
or
not
they
had
a
legitimate
reason
for
believing
what
they
were
doing
was
or
was
not
legal.
with
respect
to
the
alternative
that
the
petitioners
propose,
it
is
one
of,
or
similar
to
one
of
a
real
hodgepodge
of
conflicting
and
inconsistent
alternatives
that
various
circuits
have
suggested,
but
what
the
petitioners
are
suggesting
is
purely
result-oriented.
it
is
not
an
attempt
to
interpret
the
words
of
the
statute.
it
is
simply
an
attempt
to,
as
they
put
themselves,
put
a
gloss
on
the
statute,
which
is
another
way
of
saying,
rewrite
it,
in
order
to
achieve
a
particular
result
in
this
case,
and
it
creates
what
is
effectively
a
different
meaning
for
one
term
in
the
same
statute,
in
the
same
place
in
the
same
statute,
the
depending
upon
what
type
of
plaintiff
there
is
or
perhaps
how
many
plaintiffs
there
is,
something
that
there
is
simply
no
principle
of
statutory
construction
that
would
justify.
it
also
leads
to
extremely
subjective
and
contradictory
results.
in
fact,
the
lower
courts
cannot
even
agree
as
to
whether
or
not
to
apply
this
to
disparate
impact
versus
disparate
treatment
cases
or
whether
it
applies
to
cases
supposedly
involving
policies
as
opposed
to
just
individual
age
animus,
and
in
fact
that's
a
distinction
that
is
probably
useless,
since
any
policy
could
just
as
easily
apply
to
a
single
individual
as
well
as
to
a
group
of
employees.
and
the
petitioner's
standard
adds
additional
requirements,
requiring
repeated
actions,
or
without
colorable
justification,
that
no
court,
anywhere,
has
ever
suggested,
and
which
certainly
isn't
suggested
by
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
all
of
the
lower
courts
cannot
agree
on
what
an
alternative
standard
would
be,
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
petitioners
themselves
have
their
own
standard
and
in
fact
there
seem
to
be
as
many
standards
as
there
are
defendants,
is
simply
because
they
are
not
looking
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
there's
no
real
reference
point;
it's
purely
result-oriented,
looking
to
minimize
the
number
of
cases
in
which
this
would
appear.
and,
as
it
happens
in
this
case,
what
is
presumably
the
highest
standard
of
all
which
the
third
circuit
sets
out,
requiring
outrageousness,
the
third
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit
which
has
sometimes
talked
about
a
similar
standard,
both
agree
that
terminating
an
employee
on
the
eve
of
his
pension
vesting,
as
happened
here,
would
be
outrageous
conduct,
so
mr.
biggins
would
prevail
under
any
of
these
theories
anyway.
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
gets
at
the
heart
of
the
problem.
if
the
standard
were
outrageous,
there
will
always
be
somebody
who
will
disagree,
because
it's
a
very
amorphous
term,
and
it's
a
very
vague
and
subjective
term,
and
that's
a
good
reason
why
it
shouldn't
be
adopted
by
the
court.
i'd
like
to
talk,
as
well,
about
the
underlying
case
and
the
pension
question
that
has
been
suggested
here,
and
why
we
contend
it
is
not
really
presented
by
the
facts
of
this
case
in
the
way
that
the
petition
for
certiorari
presents
it.
the
case
was
tried
under
a
mcdonnell
douglas
scenario,
and
in
fact
analyzed
by
the
first
circuit
under
the
principles
of
mcdonnell
douglas,
and
mr.
biggins
made
out
a
prima
facie
case,
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
the
defendants
then
asserted
a
justification
for
letting
mr.
biggins
go.
namely,
they
said
that
he
was
a
disloyal
employee.
mr.
biggins
then
presented
evidence
to
rebut
that,
direct
evidence
that
he
presented
himself
to
show
that
that
was
a
false
reason
that
that
was
a
trumped
up
charge.
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
it
may
well
be,
your
honor,
but
it's
not...
that
question
isn't
presented
by
this
case,
because
in
addition
to
doing
that,
mr.
biggins
also
presented
additional
evidence
of
age
motivation
in
that
he
was
taken
at
age
62
and
forced--
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
essentially
what
the
burdine
case
means,
that...
well,
if...
assuming,
of
course,
in
the
beginning,
that
the
plaintiff's
case
is
a
disparate
treatment
case
and
the
plaintiff
is
using
a
mcdonnell
douglas
scenario
to
make
out
his
case,
that
would
be
the
result.
however,
here,
mr.
biggins
was
singled
out
among
everyone
who
supposedly
had
confidential
information,
all
of
whom
were
younger,
and
asked
to
sign
a
very
restrictive
agreement.
now,
my
colleague
says
that
mr.
biggins
could
have
signed
this
agreement
except
that
he
demanded
a
doubling
of
his
compensation,
and
i
submit
that
that
is
simply
not
the
facts
here.
what
happened
is
that
mr.
biggins
had
already
been
given
and
had
already
earned
stock
compensation
to
which
he
was
already
entitled.
he
wasn't
demanding
anything
additional.
he
was
asking
for
something
that
was
already
his
that
had
not
yet
been
given
him.
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
true,
your
honor,
in
the
view
of
the
owners
of
the
company.
however,
that
was
the
asserted
reason
of
alleged
disloyalty
which
the
plaintiff
proved
to
be
a
false
reason
and,
in
fact,
there
was
considerable
evidence
to
believe
that
that
was
never
the
belief
of
the
defendants
in
taking
their
action,
that
it
was
a
completely
phony
charge,
because
in
fact,
just
before
mr.
biggins
was
fired,
he
was
told
by
mr.
hazen
that
he
was
a
loyal
employee.
when
this
information
came
to
them
they
waited
a
considerable
period
of
time
to
bring
it
to
anyone's
attention.
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
it's
not
just
the
two
remarks,
your
honor,
it's
the
fact
that
mr.
biggins
was
being
treated
differently
on
the
basis
of
age
in
being
asked
to
sign
that
agreement,
and
that
he
was
replaced
by
a
35-year-old.
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
because
at
that
point,
your
honor,
mr.
biggins
was
in
a
position
only
because
of
his
age
that
he
could
not
only
vest
in
the
pension
but
that
he
could
draw
on
the
pension--
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
--and
in
addition
to
that,
your
honor,
mr.
biggins
was
then
replaced
by
a
35-year-old
individual
who
was
then
given
the
very
things
that
he
was
requesting
in
order
to
be
able
to
sign
that,
a
far
more
favorable
treatment
than
he
was
given.
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
and
i
think--
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
be.
however,
we
have
to
look
at
the
entire
set
of
facts
here,
which
not
only
is
that
he
was
replaced
by
a
35-year-old,
not
only
that
he
was
singled
out
for
disparate
treatment,
unlike
everyone
else
who
was
younger,
not
only
that
the
defendants
were
using
his
age
as
a
weapon
against
him
in
attempting
to
get
him
to
sign
that
agreement
because
of
the
position
he
was
in
because
of
his
pension
and
the
age
that
he
had,
not
only
the
fact
that
there
were
these
age-based
remarks,
which
incidentally
went
directly
to
the
question
of
his
benefits...
his
insurance,
and...
which
is
very
similar
to
the
pension
situation,
in
that
it
cost
them
more
because
of
his
age.
so
it's
not
a
situation
where
we
have
just
the
remarks
or
just
the
pretext,
there
are
a
whole
slew
of
age-related
matters
which
directly
bear
on
what
happened
in
this
case
which
allowed
the
jury
to
properly
draw
the
inference
that
in
fact
this
was
age
discrimination
and
in
fact
it
was
intentional
age
discrimination.
the
petitioners
have
attempted,
i
believe,
to
contrive
a
purely
legal
issue
out
of
that
pension
evidence
and
attempted
to
emphasize
what
is
essentially
a
factual
issue
about
mr.
biggins'
loyalty,
because
unless
they
can
escape
the
jury's
factual
determination
that
mr.
biggins
was
in
fact
a
loyal
employee,
they
are
left
with
no
other
explanation
for
what
happened
except
age
discrimination
and
intentional
age
discrimination
that
the
hazens
knew
to
be
illegal.
i
would
like
to
also
note
that,
in
addition
to
this,
there
was
evidence--
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
that
was
the
reason
advanced
as
a
justification
for
mr.
biggins'
termination
which,
if
it
had
been
believed,
the
jury
could
not
have
otherwise
concluded
that
mr.
biggins
was
a
victim
of
illegal
age
discrimination,
because
they
then
would
have
had
legitimate
cause
for
letting
him
go
that
was
not
related
to
age,
and
in
fact
that
was
the
central
factual
issue
of
the
entire
trial
on
which
both
sides
presented
evidence
and
the
jury
drew
its
conclusions.
they
believed
mr.
biggins,
and
they
did
not
believe
the
defendants.
i'd
like
also
to
note
that
in
this
case
the
defendants
after
mr.
biggins
had
been
terminated
then
attempted
what
amounts
to
a
cover-up
in
that
they
filed
with
the
division
of
employment
security
in
massachusetts
under
oath
a
false
reason
for
mr.
biggins'
termination,
and
in
fact
said
that
he
wasn't
terminated
at
all
and
said
that
he
had
voluntarily
quit,
and
as
many
cases
have
indicated,
this
is
also
additional
evidence
not
only
of
the
falseness
of
the
reason
given
for
what
they
had
done,
but
also
of
willfulness
on
their
part.
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
but
in
being
asked
to
sign
that
agreement
and
being
asked
to
do
what
nobody
else
was
being
asked
to
do,
and
in
being
asked
to
agree
to
what
were
very
onerous
terms
for
him,
he
was
effectively
being
asked
to
sign
away
the
stock
compensation
that
he
had
been
promised
that
was
worth
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars,
so
this
was
not
a
question
of
mr.
biggins
simply
refusing
to
do
something
that
was
reasonable
in
any
other
way.
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
just
a
couple
of
brief
points.
the
petitioner
here
effectively
is
trying
to
reverse
here
on
what
is
an
evidentiary
issue,
where
they
never
objected
to
the
evidence
being
entered
at
trial,
and
even
if
the
evidence
was
arguably
relevant
under
erisa,
never
saw
a
limiting
instruction
from
the
judge--
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
in
this
sense,
because
the
pension...
we
agree
with
the
contention
that
the
pension...
just
vesting
in
and
of
itself
wouldn't
be
evidence
of
age
discrimination.
but
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
the
plaintiff
was
62
and
was
eligible...
was
not
only
going
to
vest,
but
was
also
eligible
to
draw
on
the
pension
and
take
money
out
of
the
plan,
only
because
of
his
age,
and
he
could
only
do
that
if
and
because
he
was
60
years
old,
or
over
60
years
old,
then
in
fact,
yes,
that
would
be
sufficient
to
show
that
the
motivation
was
age,
but
of
course,
as
we
contend,
there
are
a
number
of
other
factors
that
also
add
on
to
that.
in
addition
to
the
problem
of
not
having
objected
to
this
going
into
evidence--
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
--well,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think,
certainly
it's
our
burden
to
have
enough
evidence
in
the
record,
but
it
is
in
evidence,
and
if...
but
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
should
be
relevant
evidence,
which
is
the
way
i
understand
what
the
petitioner's
contention
is,
i
don't
think
you
could
raise
that
point,
not
only
if
you
never
objected
to
it
going
into
evidence,
but
this
was
also
not
a
theory
that
was
argued
either
in
the
post-trial
motions
or
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i'm
raising
it
strictly
as
a
procedural
point,
that
you
can't
appeal
the
failure
of
the
court
to
deny
the
record.
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
that
may
be,
your
honor,
but
in
addition
to
that,
this
issue
was
not
addressed
by...
just
in
terms...
forgetting
about
whether
it
should
be
entered
into
evidence,
the
whole
issue
of
whether
or
not
it
was
evidence
of
age
discrimination
was
not
addressed
by
the
district
court
and
not
addressed
by
the
circuit
court.
it
was
really
raised
for
the
first
time
on
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
maurice
m.
cahillane,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
maurice

cahillane,
jr.
it
does,
your
honor,
there's
no
question
about
that.
i
simply
want
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
courts
below
have
never
had
the
opportunity
to
address
this
specific
issue
because
it
was
never
argued
under
that
theory.
if
there
are
no
other
questions--
