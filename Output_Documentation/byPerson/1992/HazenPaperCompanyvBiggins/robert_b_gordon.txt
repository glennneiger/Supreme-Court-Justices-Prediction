mr.
robert
b.
gordon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners
have
asked
this
court
to
review
and
set
aside
a
fundamentally
flawed
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit.
the
first
circuit
in
this
case
misapplied
the
federal
age
discrimination
in
employment
act
first
by
upholding
a
jury
finding
of
age
discrimination
not
on
the
basis
of
any
demonstrated
bias
or
prejudice
against
mr.
biggins
relating
to
his
age,
but
instead
on
the
theory
that
the
hazens
discharged
mr.
biggins
from
their
employ
in
order
to
interfere
with
his
vesting
in
the
company
pension
plan.
the
court
of
appeals
then
compounded
this
error
by
reinstating
previously
vacated
liquidated
or
double
damages
based
on
an
improper
application
of
the
knew
or
showed
reckless
disregard
test
for
willfulness
approved
by
this
court
in
twa
v.
thurston.
the
pertinent
facts
of
this
case
can
be
recited
very
briefly.
in
1977,
the
hazens
hired
mr.
biggins,
then
age
52,
to
serve
as
the
company's
technical
director.
the
biggins
held
this
position,
as
well
as
a
seat
on
the
company's
executive
committee,
for
approximately
9-1/2
years,
at
which
point
a
dispute
arose
between
the
parties
concerning
mr.
biggins'
involvement
in
certain
consulting
activities.
at
that
point,
the
hazens
discovered
that
unbeknownst
to
them,
mr.
biggins
had
been
marketing
the
services
of
a
company
he
had
founded
and
named
for
himself
to
competitors
of
hazen
paper
company.
accordingly,
the
hazens
required
mr.
biggins
to
sign
a
confidentiality
and
noncompetition
agreement
as
a
condition
of
continuing
employment
at
the
company
in
order
to
protect
hazen
paper
from
what
the
hazens
saw
as
a
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
i
don't
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
biggins,
by
his
own
trial
testimony,
acknowledged
that
he
had
no
problem
with
either
the
substance
of
the
tendered
agreement,
or,
indeed,
with
the
hazens'
reasons
for
insisting
that
he
sign
such
an
agreement,
yet
mr.
biggins
refused
to
sign
the
agreement
unless
his
annual
compensation
at
the
company
were
more
than
doubled
and
increased
to
$100,000
a
year.
the
hazens
refused,
the
parties
reached
an
impasse,
and
mr.
biggins
employment
was
terminated.
that's
all
that
happened
in
the
case,
and
none
of
it
had
anything
to
do
with
mr.
biggins'
age.
yet
by
reason
of
the
timing
of
the
termination,
mr.
biggins
failed
to
reach
the
10
years
of
service
required
to
vest
in
the
company's
pension
plan,
and
it
was
this
fact...
mr.
biggins'
pension
loss...
that
the
first
circuit
relied
upon
most
explicitly
as
the
central
basis
for
upholding
age
discrimination
liability.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
its
holding,
justice
white,
was
very
clear:
that
the
evidence
permitted
an
inference
that
the
hazens
intended
to
defeat
mr.
biggins'
pension
vesting,
and
that
there
was
a
relationship
between
mr.
biggins'
pension
status
and
his
age
that
rendered
such
pension
interference
age
discrimination
within
the
purview
of
the
adea.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
at
trial,
justice
blackmun,
mr.
biggins
first
testified
that
he
thought
it
was
a
matter
of
hours,
without
specifically
saying
how
long
he
had
to
go.
on
cross-examination,
he
was
asked
if
it
were
not
true
that
vesting
was
8
months
away,
and
he
acknowledged
that
he
had
been
told
that.
the
record
goes
no
further
on
the
point,
and
it
stands
in
precisely
that
conflict,
that
it
could
be
as
low
as
a
matter
of
hours,
or
as
long
as
8
months.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
well,
depending
upon
when
he
chose
to
retire.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
now,
turning
first
to
the
issue
of
underlying
liability,
the
first
circuit's
very
explicit
reliance
on
pension
interference
as
a
basis
for
sustaining
adea
liability
was
erroneous
for
each
of
three
independently
sufficient
reasons.
reason
number
1,
it
is
the
petitioner's
position,
first
and
foremost,
that
judicial
substitution
of
any
factor
that
is
not
age
for
age
under
the
adea
is
inconsistent
with
the
language
and
legislative
history
of
the
statute
and
is
simply
wrong.
the
adea
provides
in
very
plain
and
straightforward--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--it
may
be
relevant
evident
in
the
total
context
of
the
adea,
justice
souter,
and
certainly
it
is
relevant
to
the
question
of
damages
under
the
adea,
and
it
was
on
that
basis,
as
well
as
the
fact--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--it
is
difficult
to
see
a
situation
where
it
would
be
relevant
evidence,
except
as
evidence
defeating
the
requisite
intent
under
the
adea.
if
your
intent
is
to
defeat
pension
vesting,
then
your
intent
is
not
animated
by
considerations
of
age.
the
adea
again
provides
in
straightforward
terms
that
the
statute
was
meant--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--his
payments,
justice
kennedy,
were
not--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--and
in
fact,
the
issue
of
when
his
payments
would
commence
is
really
not
a
relevant
consideration
in
terms
of
the
calculus
of
liability
here,
because
under
this
pension
plan,
as
in
most
pension
plans,
once
an
employee
is
vested
in
their
pension
benefits,
it
belongs
to
the
employee.
there's
no
economic
benefit
to
the
employer
as
to
when
payments
do
and
do
not
begin,
so
that
issue
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
pension
interference
can
relate
to
age
discrimination.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
yes,
it
would,
justice
scalia--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--but
not
because
they're
surrogates,
but
because
the
articulated
reasons
for
your
actions
are
so
facially
unworthy
of
credence
that
one
may
draw
an
appropriate
inference
that
there
is
true
age
animus
underlying
your
decision,
but
the
issue
of
proxies
has
been
addressed
before.
this
is
the
core
principle
embraced
by
chief
justice
rehnquist's
dissent
from
the
denial
of
certiorari
in
markham
v.
geller,
and
the
logic
of
chief
justice
rehnquist's
position
on
this
point
we
submit
is
unassailable
and,
indeed,
consistent
with
the
long
tradition
of
this
court.
in
determining
the
non...
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
discriminatory
intent
under
statutory
and
constitutional
provisions,
this
court
has
a
long
history
of
strictly
respecting
the
textual
limits
of
the
protected
category
at
issue.
for
example,
in
personnel
administrator
of
massachusetts
v.
feeney,
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
to
enact
a
statute
providing
a
job
preference
to
veterans,
notwithstanding
that
at
the
time
of
such
statutory
enactment
only
males
were
eligible
for
service
in
the
armed
forces.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
to
the
extent
that
it
permitted
an
inference
of
adverse
impact,
to
the
extent
that
theory
of
liability
is
applied
by
this
court
to
actions
under
the
adea,
that
could
be
relevant,
and
it
could
in
theory
state
a
claim,
but
the
issue
we're
talking
about
here--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--if
the
intent
of
the
company,
justice
stevens,
in
your
hypothetical
is
strictly
to
save
money
based--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--that
would
not
be
a
violation
of
the
adea.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
the
statute
simply
prohibits
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
age,
and
this
is--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--this
result
is
consistent
with
the
decision
in
feeney.
it's
likewise
consistent
with
this
court's
pronouncement
in
general
electric
v.
gilbert,
where
the
court
held
that
it
was
not
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
for
an
employer
to
exclude
pregnancy
from
its
benefits
coverage,
not
withstanding
the
fact
that
pregnancy
is
a
condition
uniquely
correlated
with
being
female.
likewise--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
there
could,
and
in
fact
under
title
vii,
because
adverse
impact
liability
has
been
applied
in
that
arena,
there
arguably
is.
but
the
same
principles
that
we
are
submitting
have
also
been
recognized
by
this
court
under
title
vii
as
in
gilbert,
and
in
espinoza
v.
farrah
manufacturing
company,
where
justice
marshall,
writing
for
the
court,
found
that
it
was
not
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
national
origin
to
refuse
to
hire
non-united
states
citizens,
notwithstanding
a
logical
correlation
between
the
two.
it's
thus
our
first
point
that
judicial
substitution
of
any
factor...
here
it
was
pension
interference,
but
it
would
apply
to
other
factors...
for
age
is
not
allowed
by
the
statute
at
all.
barring
a
showing
of
adverse
impact
in
the
manner
contemplated
by
griggs
v.
duke
power,
this
would
require
reversal
of
the
first
circuit's
decision
here,
which
rested
not
on
legitimate
inferences
of
age
bias,
but
instead
on
pension
interference.
reason
two:
even
if
this
court
were,
in
certain
situations
such
as
those
suggested
by
justice
stevens,
prepared
to
endorse
the
proposition
that
a
trier
of
fact
applying
the
adea
may
substitute
surrogates
for
age
when
there
is
a
factual
relationship
for
the
surrogate
and
age,
the
case
at
bar
would
not
satisfy
the
condition
precedent
for
such
a
substitution.
here,
the
first
circuit
simply
presumed
that
there
was
a
factual
relationship
between
mr.
biggins
age
and
his
pension
status.
the
court
of
appeals
reasoned
that
mr.
biggins'
age
and
pension
status
were,
to
borrow
the
court's
phrase,
inextricably
intertwined,
and
that
if
it
were
not
for
mr.
biggins'
age...
62...
he
would
not
have
been
within
a
hairbreadth
of
vesting
in
the
hazen
paper
pension.
as
the
solicitor
general
has
conceded,
however,
and
as
the
undisputed
facts
bear
out,
the
first
circuit's
reasoning
on
this
point
is
completely
without
force.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
it
would
have
been
appropriate
to
object,
but
there
was
no
objection.
the
evidence
was
clearly
relevant
to
the
erisa
section
510
claim,
and
it
was
clearly
relevant
to
the
question
of
damages
under
the
adea.
the
trial
judge
gave
appropriate
adea
instructions,
which
made
no
mention
of
allowing
the
jury
to
infer
age
animus
on
the
basis
of
pension
interference.
now,
it
is
true
there
was
no
objection
made
to
the
introduction
of
the
evidence
as
being
nonprobative
of
age
discrimination,
but
that,
of
course,
was
true
of
every
piece
of
evidence--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--there
were
no
requests
for
instructions
on
this
point
by
either
side,
justice
white.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
yes,
your
honor.
here
again,
the
first
circuit
simply
presumed
a
factual
connection
between
pension
status
and
age
that
simply
does
not
exist.
employees
at
hazen
paper
vest
strictly
on
the
basis
of
length
of
service.
indeed,
ironically,
the
only
reason
mr.
biggins
himself
was
not
long
vested
in
the
hazen
paper
pension
at
the
age
of
62
was
the
unusual
fact
that
he'd
been
hired
by
the
hazens
at
the
age
of
52,
obviously
a
fact
tending
to
negate
any
inference
of
age
animus
on
the
part
of
the
hazens.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
it
was
in
the
trial
record...
the
summary
plan
description
of
the
pension,
not
the
pension
plan
itself.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
finally,
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
age
proxies
are
not
allowable
as
surrogates
under
the
adea
at
all,
and
in
addition
to
the
fact--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--yes.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
because
i
believe
the
plan
depends
on
hours
of
service,
and
that's
computed
not
simply
chronologically,
but
based
on
hours.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
yes,
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
[laughter]
as
our
third
point
on
underlying--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--no,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
as
our
third
point,
even
if
age
proxies
were
allowable
under
the
adea
at
all,
which
we
submit
they
are
not,
and
even
if
in
this
case
one
were
prepared
to
endorse
what
the
first
circuit
has
done
and
no
other
court
has
ever
done...
that
is,
allowed
a
factor
having
no
factual
relationship
to
age
whatsoever
to
serve
as
such
a
surrogate
for
age,
petitioners
submit
that
under
no
circumstances
may
pension
interference
properly
provide
the
predicate
for
an
inference
of
age
animus.
this
court
held
in
patterson
v.
mclean--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
we
think--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--no,
your
honor.
if
it's
not
material
to
the
judgment,
and
the
judgment
is
sustainable
on
other
grounds,
which
it
clearly
is
not,
then
the
court
could,
under
its
prior
holdings,
affirm
the
judgment
on
other
grounds,
but
here,
it
is
absolutely
plain
that
there
is
no
basis
for
sustaining
the
judgment
of
the
first
circuit.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
justice
white,
that
is
an
option
that
the
court
has
which
was
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general.
we
submit
that
it's
unnecessary.
we
submit
that
when
the
first
circuit
opinion
is
taken
on
its
own
terms
and
divested
of
its
improper
reliance
on
pension
interference
as
a
basis
for
adea
liability,
the
entire
inference
of
age
animus
evaporates.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
no,
your
honor,
we'd
respectfully
disagree,
and
if
i
could
answer
chief
justice
rehnquist's
position
by
dealing
with
each
of
those
separately,
in
10
years'
employment
and
in
a
5-day
trial
reviewing
this
extremely
intricate
relationship
between
mr.
biggins
and
the
hazens,
the
only
evidence
that
in
any
way
concerned
age
were
two
isolated
remarks
that
were,
we
submit,
completely
innocuous
in
content.
in
the
context
of
the
entire
record,
those
remarks,
simply
as
a
matter
of
law,
cannot
support
the
inference
that
the
hazens
were
motivated
to
require
mr.
biggins
to
sign
a
confidentiality
agreement
based
on
age
animus.
these
are
the
classic
stray
remarks
that
have
absolutely
no
basis
for
sustaining
adea
liability.
indeed,
every
business
in
america
would
be
subject
to
adea
liability
if
the
mere
fact
that
those
kinds
of
utterances
are
mentioned
at
some
indeterminate
point
in
a
working
relationship
could
sustain
liability.
as
for
the
differential
treatment--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--the
first
comment
was
a
joke
about
a
handball
court,
and
of
course
there
was
no
evidence
that
mr.
biggins
was
denied
membership
in
the
handball
court.
it
was
a
joke
that
the
handball
court--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--it
was
that
mr.
biggins
and
mr.
gezner
wouldn't
have
as
much
use
for
the
handball
court
because
they
were
so
old,
and
the
second
comment,
we
submit,
was
simply
a
true
statement--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--the
second
remark--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--the
second
remark,
justice
scalia,
was
simply
a
true
statement
of
what,
in
fact,
every
businessman
in
america
knows
to
be
fact...
that
it
does
cost
more
to
insure
older
persons.
indeed,
the
congress
which
enacted
the
adea
recognized
that
very
same
fact,
and
that
is
why
there
is
a
specific
privilege
embodied
in
section
4(f)(2)
of
the
statute
allowing
employers
to
make
certain
benefits
distinctions
based
on
age,
a
recognition
by
congress.
congress
is
no
more
motivated
by
age
animus
in
recognizing
that
fact
than
the
hazens
were
here.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
absolutely
not.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
but
there's
no
suggestions
that
the
hazens
discharged
mr.
biggins
for
anything
to
do
with
his
insurance
coverage.
indeed,
mr.
gezner--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--and
if
in
fact
that
was
the
policy
of
the
company,
justice
stevens,
that
would
perhaps
state
an
adverse
impact
violation,
but
here,
adverse
impact,
as
all
parties
to
the
court
concede,
has
no
application
to
the
case.
as
just
a
very
brief
final
point
with
respect
to
predicate
liability,
we
would
submit
that
under
the
rules
stated
in
patterson
v.
mclean
credit
union,
pension
interference
may
not
ever,
as
a
matter
of
law,
provide
the
predicate
for
an
inference
of
age
animus.
in
patterson,
this
court
held
that
when
construing
a
civil
rights
statute,
it
is
inappropriate
to
construe
an
earlier
statute
broadly
and
beyond
the
reach
of
its
text
in
order
to
cover
conduct
that
is
clearly
and
in
terms
covered
by
a
later
enacted
statute.
recall
that
in
patterson,
this
court
refused
to
extend
the
reach
of
section
1981
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866,
which
simply
barred
discrimination
in
the
making
or
enforcement
of
contracts.
it
refused
to
extend
the
reach
of
that
statute
to
cover
on-the-job
racial
harassment
when
congress
had
later,
and
in
clear
terms,
covered
such
conduct
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
'64.
the
court's
holding
rested
both
on
prudential
principles
of
statutory
construction,
which
we
submit
are
applicable
here,
and
further
on
a
desire
to
avoid
circumvention
of
the
detailed
enforcement
mechanisms
provided
for
by
congress
in
the
later
statute.
here,
precisely
as
in
patterson,
the
existence
of
a
clear
statutory
remedy
under
erisa
section
510,
a
later-enacted
statute
with
its
own
independent
enforcement
mechanism
militates
very
strongly
against
stretching
the
coverage
of
the
adea
beyond
its
text
to
provide
a
duplicative
legal
remedy.
turning
next
to
the
issue
of
liquidated
damages,
i
would
begin
by
pointing
out
that
under
the
law
a
necessary
precondition
to
an
award
of
liquidated
damages
is
a
legitimate
and
sustainable
finding
of
underlying
age
discrimination.
should
this
court
conclude,
as
the
petitioners
have
urged,
that
there
is
no
proper
basis
for
sustaining
adea
liability
at
all
here,
then
the
first
circuit's
reinstatement
of
liquidated
damages
must
be
struck
automatically,
and
this
court
would
not
need
to
reach
the
question
of
what
the
appropriate
standard
for
awarding
such
damages
ought
be.
however,
even
if
predicate
liability
could
on
some
theory
which
has
yet
to
be
articulated
by
any
party
be
sustained,
petitioners
submit
that
under
no
rational
application
of
the
statutory
standard
of
willful
can
the
jury's
finding
of
willfulness
be
upheld,
and
the
district
court's
decision
to
vacate
liquidated
damages
should
accordingly
be
reinstated.
the
adea
provides
in
section
7(b)
that
liquidated
or
double
damages
shall
only
be
awarded
in
cases
of
willful
violations
of
the
statute.
this
court
has
stated
numerous
times
and
in
numerous
different
contexts
that
willful
is
a
term
of
varying
meanings
and
must
be
construed
according
to
its
context.
now,
in
trans
world
airlines
v.
thurston,
the
court
held
that
in
the
context
of
the
adea,
congress
used
the
term
willful
in
order
to
provide
a
form
of
punitive
damages.
the
court
in
thurston
found
that
by
deliberately
providing
for
liquidated
damages
only
in
cases
of
willful
violations
of
the
statute,
borrowing
that
standard
from
the
fair
labor
standards
act's
provision
for
criminal
penalties,
congress
meant
to
create
a
two-tiered
scheme
for
adea
liability,
with
liquidated
damages
specifically
reserved
for
those
most
especially
blameworthy
and
reprehensible
violations
of
the
statute.
petitioners...
in
reaching
this
result,
the
court
in
thurston
specifically
rejected
interpretations
of
the
term,
willful,
that
would,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
result
in
an
award
of
liquidated
damages
in
all
or
virtually
all
cases
where
underlying
liability
were
found.
petitioners
most
respectfully
submit
that
the
time
has
come
for
this
court
to
modify
the
knew
or
showed
reckless
disregard
test
for
willfulness
it
approved
in
thurston.
experience
in
the
lower
court
since
thurston
was
handed
down
has
demonstrated
that
this
test,
when
applied
by
its
terms,
does
the
very
thing
which
congress
and
the
court
in
thurston
indicated
a
punitive
willfulness
standard
ought
not
do.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
it
need
not
do
it
in
disparate
impact
cases,
your
honor,
or
again
i
would
remind
the--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--it
provides
an
automatic
enhancement
in
virtually
every
case.
there
is
a
narrow
band
of
cases,
and
they
are
accurately
identified
by
the
solicitor
general,
in
which
liquidated
damages
liability
can
be
avoided,
but
they
are
limited
explicitly
to
adverse
impact
cases,
which
again
research
shows
represent
less
than
2
percent
of
the
cases
in
adea
litigation
and
cases
where
legal
affirmative
defenses
are
involved,
which
this
court
has
stated
numerous
times,
such
as
in
criswell
and
in
last
term's
decision
in
johnson
controls,
are
very,
very
narrow.
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--that
is
precisely
our
position,
justice
souter,
and
indeed,
the
reason
we
know
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
award
liquidated
damages
in
even
virtually
all
cases
where
predicate
liability
is
established,
is
revealed
in
its
departure
from
the
standards
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
had
congress
intended
that
result,
it
would
have
done
precisely
what
it
did
in
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
it
would
have
authorized
an
award
of
liquidated
damages
as
a
matter
of
course
for
every
violation
of
the
statute
subject
only
to
a
narrow
exception
where
the
employer
can
demonstrate
good
faith
as
congress
provided
for
in
the
portal
to
portal
act
amendments,
but
by
doing
the
precise
opposite...
specifically
borrowing
the
statutory
standard
from
the
criminal
penalties
provision...
congress
created
the
diametrically
opposed
presumption.
numerous
courts
that
have
confronted
this
question
have
recognized
that
when
applied
by
its
terms,
thurston's
new
or
showed
reckless
disregard
test
essentially
reads
the
term,
willful,
out
of
the
statute.
these
courts
are
properly
recognizing
that
in
a
statute
such
as
the
adea,
where
a
specific
intent
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
underlying
violation
itself,
that
a
standard
of
punitive
damages
activated
merely
by
a
requirement
that
such
violation
have
been
nonnegligent,
is
in
reality
no
standard
at
all.
it
is
for
this
very
reason
that
a
majority
of
the
circuits,
as
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
are
departing
from
thurston's
definition
of
willfulness
and
imposing
a
heightened
standard
for
liquidated
damages
which
properly
resembles
the
common-law
test
for
punitive
damages.
these
courts,
by
modifying
thurston
in
this
way,
giving
life
to
the
common-law
sense
of
punitive
damages,
are
properly
serving
congress'
intent
to
preserve
two
discrete
tiers
of
adea
liability
with
liquidated
damages
reserved
only
for
the
most
reprehensible
violations
of
the
statute.
accordingly,
we
are
asking
the
court
to
use
this
case
as
an
occasion
to
refine
the
definition
of
willfulness
approved
in
thurston
and
return
liquidated
damages
to
their
punitive
moorings.
a
violation
of
the
adea
should
only
be
deemed
willful
if
the
employer's
age
discrimination
is
especially
reprehensible,
and
in
this
respect
we
have
alerted
the
court
to
a
series
of
considerations
which
at
common
law
reflect
how
that
determination
ought
be
made
by
a
jury...
namely,
whether
the
employer
showed
reckless
disregard
for
the
matter
of
whether
its
conduct
violated
the
adea,
whether
the
employer's
actions
were
repeated,
were
without
colorable
justification,
were
otherwise
unusually
harsh,
egregious,
or
outrageous.
these
are
well-established
standards
for
common-law
punitive
damages,
as
this
court's
decision
in
pacific
mutual
life
insurance
company
v.
haslip
reflects.
justice
blackmun's
majority
opinion
as
well
as
justice
o'connor's
concurrence
reflect
that
these
are
standards
that
the
court
is
comfortable
with
insofar
as
punitive
damages
standards
are
concerned,
and
they
should
be
the
ones
which
inform
the
meaning
of
willfulness
under
the
adea.
when
this
standard
is
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
is
absolutely
clear,
we
submit,
that
the
jury's
finding
of
willfulness
cannot
stand.
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
hazens
engaged
in
a
pattern
of
discriminatory
conduct,
that
there
was
prior
evidence
of
repeated
discrimination,
that
they
singled
mr.
biggins
out
for
unusually
harsh
or
oppressive
treatment
relating
to
his
age,
nor
was
there
evidence
that
the
hazens'
actions
were
utterly
without
colorable
justification,
a
term
this
court
has
used
in
interpreting
willful
in
its
decisions
in
murdock
and
spies.
the
most
the
evidence
showed
here
was
that
the
hazens
confronted
an
employee
who
was
marketing
services
to
competitors
and
demanded
that
he
signed
a
confidentiality
agreement.
given
mr.
biggins
sensitive
position
at
the
company
and
having
a
seat
on
its
executive
committee,
this
cannot
be
construed
as
discriminatory
at
all.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
justice
scalia,
we
submit
that
willful
is
a
term
of
some
elasticity,
and
this
court
has
specifically
stated...
has
specifically
stated
on
many
occasions
in
the
past
that
it
must
be
construed
according
to
its
context.
in
murdock,
the
court
construed
the
term
willful
to
mean
persistently,
perversely,
and
utterly
without
justifiable
excuse.
those
are
many
of
the
same
factors
that
we
are
submitting
should
inform
the
definition
of
willfulness
here.
as
a
final
point,
the
petitioners
submit
that
even
if
this
court
determines
not
to
modify
thurston,
even
an
unmodified
application
of
that
test
cannot
sustain
liability
here.
the
first
circuit's
decision
to
treat
thomas
hazen's
acknowledgement
that
he
knew
age
discrimination
was
illegal
as
conclusive
proof
of
willfulness
is
illogical
on
its
face,
flatly
inconsistent
with
justice
stevens'
reasoning
in
mclaughlin
v.
richland
shoe,
and
in
fact
restates
the
jiffy
june
in
the
picture
test
that
has
twice
been
discredited
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
justice
scalia,
given
the
fact
that
the
adea
requires
itself
that
employers
post
notices
acknowledging
the
illegality
of
discrimination,
an
underlying
finding
of
discrimination
by
the
trier
of
fact
would
represent
an
adjudicated
conclusion
that
the
violation
was
knowing.
it
would
practically
mandate
imposition
of
liquidated
damages
in
virtually
every
case.
it
cannot
mean
that,
and
it
certainly
cannot
mean
what--
mr.
robert
b.
gordon
--but
the
evidence
certainly
wouldn't
require...
wouldn't
have
to
go
that
far,
justice
scalia,
to
permit
the
inference
of
knowledge.
again,
given
that
the
statute
requires
specific
intent,
and
given
that
the
statute
also
requires
knowledge
of
the
statutory
prohibition...
and
this
is
not
a
statute
of
great
complexity
like
the
tax
laws.
given
those
two
facts,
taking
them
together,
there's
simply
no
avoidance
of
liquidated
damages
for
employers
under
thurston,
and
it
should
be
changed,
but
at
a
minimum,
even
thurston
itself
can't
sustain
liability
here,
because
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
hazens
knew
or
showed
reckless
disregard
for
the
matter
of
whether
pension
interference
could
possibly
constitute
an
adea
violation.
