justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
any
request
for
an
instruction
to
the
jury
to
that
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
if
the
court
of
appeals
used
that...
relied
on
the
pension
to
any
extent
to
find
age
discrimination,
they
should
be
reversed--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
any
extent.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
agree
with
that,
and
i
suppose
if
you're
right
that
evidence
should
not
have
been
used
at
all,
perhaps
we
should
remand.
if
you're
right,
we
could
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
an
error
in
relying
on
it
to
any
extent
and
remand
it
to
see
what
the
other
evidence
might
amount
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
in
that
kind
of
a
case,
is
the
conclusion
that
it
had
to
be
intentional
discrimination
on
age,
therefore?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
normally
is
to
be
inferred
from
the
finding
of
pretext?
if
it's
pretextual,
does
that
mean
that
it's
intentionally
discrimination-based
on
age?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
that
the
jury
found
that
he
was
a
loyal
employee?
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask,
let's
suppose
that
the
only
evidence
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
was
the
pension
item,
would
you
say
that
we
should
still
affirm?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now,
liability.
do
you
mean
willfulness,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
there's
enough
that
we
would
be
justified
in
affirming.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you...
i
thought
your
brief
suggested
that
there's
enough
other
evidence
that
we
could
affirm--
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
if
the
only
evidence
that
there
was
was
the
pension
item,
there
wouldn't
have
been...
shouldn't
have
been
a
prima
facie
case
made.
justice
byron
r.
white
policy.
it
was
a
policy...
a
group.
