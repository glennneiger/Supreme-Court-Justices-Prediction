we'll
hear
argument
next
in
92-207,
the
united
states
v.
xavier
padilla.
mr.
bryson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
bryson,
don't
our
cases
generally
in
the
fourth
amendment
area
say
that
the
privacy
interest
is
protected
against
seizures
and
the
property...
the
privacy
is
to
protect
against
searches,
and
the
privacy
interest
is...
the
property
interest
is
to
protect
it
against
seizures?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
conceding
that
point--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--why
were
you
getting
into
the
question
of
the
authority
of
the
driver
of
the
car
to
consent
to
the
opening
of
the
trunk?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
the
officer,
as
justice
kennedy
said,
has
to
operate
on
reasonable
assumptions.
he
can't
get
a
whole
chain
of
title
to
the
car
when
he's--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
nash,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you're
right
about
that,
mr.
nash,
why
did
the
ninth
circuit
reverse
as
to
strubbe?
i
mean,
they
decided
the
case
finally
as
to
him,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
way--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
isn't
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
in
its
opinion,
as
i
read
it.
it
apparently
has
a
well-developed
doctrine
of
joint
venture
in
a
criminal
undertaking,
and
it
referred
to
joint
venture,
and
it
cited
previous
cases,
so
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
decide
the
case
on
that
ground.
perhaps
it
should
have
decided
it
on
another
ground,
and
perhaps
the
two
are
interrelated,
but
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
just
abounds
with
the
words,
joint
venture.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
could
answer
that
yes
or
no,
mr.
nash.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
our
cases
say
that
you
can't
have
a
legitimate
possessory
interest
in
contraband?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
of
our
cases
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
trupiano
was
largely
overruled
by
rabinowitz.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any
case
stronger
than
what
remains
of
trupiano
to
support
your
position?
you
say
the
government
has
nothing
to
support
its
position.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nash.
the
case
is
submitted.
