justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
mr.
bryson,
i
thought
the
major
point
you
wanted
to
have
us
decide
was
whether
or
not
this
joint
enterprise--
justice
byron
r.
white
--notion
is
a
valid
one
to
give
standing,
and
to
decide
that,
i
would
think
we
could
just...
we
would
say,
just
forget
about
the
ownership
of
the
car.
we'd
say,
suppose
padilla
owned
the
car.
suppose
padilla
owned
the
car
and
the
same
thing
happened...
he
consented
to
go
in...
and
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
come
out
exactly
the
same
way.
they
would
have
said,
because
they
were
all
coconspirators,
they
all
have
an
interest
in
the
transportation
of
cocaine
and
that
car,
they
have
standing
to
object.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that's...
is
that
the
major
point
you
want
us
to
decide?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
ownership
of
the
car
certainly...
perhaps
we
don't
need
to...
if
you
want
to
hassle
about
it,
maybe...
maybe
we
could
avoid
even
deciding
the
question
you
want,
because
you
should
lose
on
another
ground--
justice
byron
r.
white
--which
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
who
owned
the
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
what
if
you...
if
we
say
that...
if
you
lose
on
that
major
question,
why,
the
case
is
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your...
the
case
is
over,
and
you
lose.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
win
on
that
point,
the
case
isn't
over
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
their
cocaine.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
the
ninth
circuit
says
because
you
have
control
and
you
have
a
joint
enterprise,
you
have
a
joint
interest
in
the
transportation
of
that
cocaine
by
that
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
the
issue
of
whether
they're
right
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
would
still...
as
i
said
before,
i
think
i
said
if
padilla
owned
the
car,
but
assume
the
driver
of
the
car
owned
the
car,
gave
consent,
the
ninth
circuit
would
have
come
out
exactly
the
same
way,
because
the
members
of
the
joint
enterprise
have
an
interest
in
the
car
and
an
interest
in
the
cocaine.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
well,
that's
the
issue.
that's
the
major
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
the
district
judge
just
focused
on
the
illegal
stop
of
the
car
and
that
everything
else
was
illegal
after
that.
the
question
is,
who
has
the
right
to
question
the
illegal
stop?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
question,
so--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
if
no
one
else
except
the
driver
had
standing
to
challenge
the
stop,
your
clients
should
lose
the
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
assume
we
agree
with
the
government
that
this
joint
enterprise
theory
doesn't
give
standing
to
the
members
of
the
conspiracy
without
more?
then
you
would
still
suggest
to
us
that
we
should
affirm
on
another
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
namely...
but
if
we
agree
with
the
government
on
that,
it
seems
to...
on
their
submission
about
the
joint
enterprise,
it
seems
to
me
the
only
people
who
might
have
standing
to
complain
would
be
the
simpsons--
justice
byron
r.
white
--who
own
the
car.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
that
the
driver
of
the
car
owned
the
car,
and
let's
assume
that
the
consent
was
valid
to
open
the
trunk.
now,
the
possessory
right
to
that
cocaine
isn't
going
to
help
them
very
much,
because
it's
just
a
plain
view
seizure,
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
that
would
be
this
case
if
we
say
that
the
simpsons
don't
have...
just
because
of
their
ownership
don't
have
standing
to
object
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
we
don't
agree
with
that,
why
the
seizure
of
the
cocaine
is
not
challengeable.
