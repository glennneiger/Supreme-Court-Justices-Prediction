mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
calls
on
the
court
to
address
the
dimension
of
the
so-called
fourth
amendment
rule
of
standing
as
it
applies
to
a
drug-smuggling
conspiracy.
the
case
comes
from
the
ninth
circuit
on
certiorari,
and
began
when
there
was
a
stop
on
the
highway
between
tucson
and
phoenix,
arizona,
of
a
man...
luis
arciniega...
who
was
transporting
a
large
quantity
of
cocaine.
the
traffic
stop
has
since
been
found
to
be
an
invalid
stop,
and
we
haven't
challenged
that,
the
validity
of
the
stop
in
this
court.
what
happened
after
the
stop
was
that
about...
so
far
as
the
record
reflects,
about
5
minutes
into
the
stop
mr.
arciniega
consented
to
the
search
of
the
trunk
of
the
car
and
the
officers
immediately
found
560
pounds
of
cocaine.
mr.
arciniega
then
cooperated
with
the
investigation
and
that
led
to
the
arrest
of
each
of
the
respondents
and
others,
and
they
were
all
charged
with
conspiracy
and
various
substantive
counts
under
the
drug
control
statutes.
the
district
court
found
first
that
the
stop
was
invalid
and
second
that
each
of
the
respondents
had
standing
to
object
to
the
stop
of
arciniega's
car
and
the
search
of
the
trunk
that
led
to
the
drugs,
and
then
further
found
that
the
rest
of
the
investigation
had
followed
from
those
discoveries
and
therefore
that
the
evidence
with
respect
to
the
defendants
had
to
be
suppressed.
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
government's
appeal
affirmed
in
major
part.
the
court
held
with
respect
to
respondent
xavier
padilla
and
with
respect
to
the
two
simpsons
that
the
district
court's
ruling
was
correct,
relying
principally
on
what
we
will
call
the
joint
venture
exception
to
the
standing
rule,
the
joint
venture
application
of
the
standing
principle,
and
with
respect
to
maria
and
george
padilla
the
court
said
that
a
remand
was
necessary
to
determine
whether
they
had
standing
under
this
exception,
and
with
respect
to
the
remaining
respondent
the
court
said
that
he
did
not
have
the
standing
of
this
exception.
the
court's
rationale
essentially
was
that
because
the
simpsons
"had
an
interest
in
the
car
and
also
had
a
supervisory
or
control
relationship
with
respect
to
the
conspiracy
and
the
activities
of
the
conspiracy
on
the
day
of
the
stop,
that
they
had
standing,
and
because
xavier
padilla
again,
like
the
simpsons,
had
a
supervisory
or
control
relationship
within
the
conspiracy
with
respect
to
the
transportation,
that
he
had
standing
to
object
to
the
stop
of
the
car.
"
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
you
should,
and
here's
why.
the
ninth
circuit
referred
to
the
expectation
of
privacy,
but
they
were
clearly
talking
about
both
privacy
and
property
interests
that
were
affected
by
the
stop.
there's
discussion
throughout
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
even
though
they
use
the
term
expectation
of
privacy,
which
isn't
precisely
the
right
nomenclature,
but
they
use
that
term
to
describe
what
they
clearly
meant
to
say
was
at
issue
here,
which
was
both
the
simpsons'
ownership
of
the
car
and
therefore
the
effect
of
both
the
stop
and
the
ensuing
search
on
the
rights,
the
fourth
amendment
rights
in
general
of
the
simpsons,
and
also
the
ownership
interest.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
we...
in
our
cert
petition,
we
address...
we
use
the
language
that
the
court
of
appeals
used.
now,
i
think
it
is
somewhat
imprecise.
we
probably
should
have
specifically
said
property
and
privacy
interest.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the
position
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
joint
venture,
which
of
course
in
their
view
incorporated
the
interest
of
the
simpsons
in
the
car
and
the
interest
of
xavier
padilla
in
the
cocaine,
that
that...
the
joint
venture,
including--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
we
challenged
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
which
was
premised
in
its
finding
that
there
was
an
expectation
of
privacy,
as
they
called
it--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,
i
think
there
are
two
points
to
be
made.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
meant
to
encompass
both
privacy
and
property
interests.
they
used
the
wrong
terminology,
as
this
court
has--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
our
petition
is
that
we
did,
and
what's
more...
and
there's
a
second
reason.
the
respondents
came
back
and
in
defense
of
the
judgment
said
that
there
is
a
reason
that
this
judgment
is
valid,
even
if
the
ground
that
we
challenged
it
on
in
the
petition
should
be
viewed
as
being
limited
to
expectation
of
privacy,
and
that
is
that
there
were
property
interests
at
stake
here
which
were
affected.
that...
if
that's
an
independent
ground
in
support
of
the
judgment,
then
we're
entitled
to
respond
to
their
claim
with
respect
to
an
independent--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,
we...
the
answer
is
yes
and
no.
we
think
that
the
ownership
of
the
car--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
the
first...
the
yes
part
is
that
we
think
the
ownership
of
the
car
generally
gives
the
owner
enough...
a
right
to
object
to
a
seizure
of
the
car
which
provides
the
owner--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--this
particular
stop
was
a
seizure,
but
it
did
not
affect
the
ownership
interests--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
was
a
seizure
of
the
car.
it
affected
the
interests
of--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--exactly.
it
did
not...
and
when
i
say
hurt,
what
i
mean
is,
it
did
not
affect
any
of
his
property
interests
in
the
car,
because
the
only
thing
that
was
at
issue
there
was
the
interference
with
arciniega's
right
to
continue
down
the
highway.
arciniega
was
in
control
of
the
car.
the
stop
affected
control.
it
didn't
affect
a
proprietary
interest
in
the
car,
so
yes,
generally
an
owner
of
a
car
has
a
right
to
object
to
a
procedure...
to
a
seizure,
but
in
this
case
this
kind
of
procedure
did
not
implicate
the
owner--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
if
it
had
been
loaned
for
a
week...
suppose
it's
a
rental
car,
to
make
it--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--and
the
rental
agreement
was
that
after
7
days
it
should
be
returned,
and
in
fact
the
car
was
returned
on
the
seventh
day...
the
government
had
held
it
for
6
days
in
between...
we
would
say
that
the
effect
on
the
person
who
rented
the
car,
the
renter
of
the
car,
the
rental
company,
was
that
their
property
interests
in
the
car
were
not
affected.
now,
this
case
involves
much
less,
of
course,
than
a
6-day
seizure,
but
the
principle
is
the
same.
the
principle
is
that
the
interests
of
the
owners
in
getting
their
car
back
and
in
being
able
to
enjoy
the
use
of
the
car
during
the
time
that
they
intended
to
use
it,
which
was
when
it
came
back,
was
not
affected.
keep
in
mind
that
this
was...
that
the
simpsons
gave
this
car
to
arciniega
for
a
couple
of
days.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
if
there's
a
privacy
interest,
then
the
privacy
interest
is...
and
they
have
retained
a
privacy
interest
in
the
car,
then
they
may
well
have
a
basis
for
objecting
to
the
search
of
the
car
but
not
to
the
seizure.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
where,
as
in
this
case,
all
that
happens
is
that
you
hold
the
goods
and
you
don't
conduct
a
search
at
all...
in
this
case
there
was
a
consent
search,
which
waived,
in
effect,
the
privacy
interests
of
the
simpsons
in
the
trunk,
whatever
those
might
have
been,
but
if
all
that
would
happen
in
this
case
is
that
there
had
been
a
stop,
and
let's
say
arciniega
had
made
a
confession
which
implicated
the
simpsons,
then
no
privacy
interest
in
the
car
would
have
been
implicated.
the
car
wouldn't
have
been
held.
but
what
really
is
at
issue
with
respect
to
the
simpsons
is,
they
have
given
over
control,
the
use
of
the
car,
for
a
period
of
several
days
to
this
man,
and
that
man's
personal
right
to
control
the
car
which
has
been
ceded
to
him
by
the
simpsons
is
what
was
affected
by
the
stop,
plus
his
personal
right
as
an
individual
to
travel
on
the
highway
without
being
interfered
with.
there
is
no
interference
with
the
ultimate...
let's
called
a
remainder
interest,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
in
the
property
of
the
simpsons.
now,
they
may
have
a
separate
privacy
interest
which
may
be
implicated,
but
if,
as
we
submit,
they
have
a
privacy
interest,
say
in
the
trunk,
and
the
district
court
found
that
they
did,
that
privacy
interest
could
be
in
effect
waived
by
arciniega's
consenting
to
a
search
of
the
trunk,
which
we
think
it's
manifestly
the
case
that
he
had
a
right
to--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
that's
right,
and
here,
we...
there
was
a
seizure
which
affected
the
property
interest
of,
control
of
the
car
of
arciniega,
temporary
possessory
interest,
but
he
doesn't...
he's
not
a
defendant,
so
he
would
have
standing
to
object,
but
the
privacy
concerns
which
are
with
regard
to
the
search
of
the
trunk
of
the
car
are
at
minimum
waived
by
arciniega's
agreement
to
allow
the
search
of
the
trunk.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no.
no,
your
honor,
the
district
court
did
not--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
the
only
thing--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
the
question
of
consent
is
open,
your
honor.
they
may...
if
this
case
is
remanded
they
may
say
that
there
was
an
invalid
consent,
and
if
they
both
have
continuing
privacy
interest
in
the
trunk,
and
we
had
an
invalid
consent,
then
we
would
have
a
problem,
because
then--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
that
you're
going
to
have
to
remand...
assuming
we
win
the
major
submission
in
the
case,
you
will
have
to
remand
for
a
disposition
of
the
remaining
claims
and
ultimately
for
trial,
and
i
think...
there
has
not
been
a
final
disposition
by
the
court
of
appeals,
for
example,
of
the
consent
issue,
and
there's
a
finding
by--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--this
is
this
difference,
i
think:
if
the
simpsons
did
not
retain
any
privacy
interest,
even
a
joint
privacy
interest
with
arciniega
in
the
trunk
of
the
car...
let's...
suppose
this
had
been
a
search
of
the
front
seat,
where
the
officer
had
stopped
arciniega
and
just
looked
in
the
front
seat
and
there
was
all
the
cocaine,
we
would
argue,
and
we
would
be
right,
that
the
simpsons
just
had
no
continuing
privacy
interest
in
the
front
seat
of
the
car.
so
in
that
setting
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
arciniega's
consent
was
obtained
voluntarily
or
involuntarily,
since
the
simpsons
would
have
no
continuing
privacy
rights,
but
the
argument
that
the
simpsons
made
below,
and
the
argument
that
was
accepted
by
the
district
court,
was
that
they
continued
to
have
a
privacy
interest
in
the
trunk.
now--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--if
that's
true--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--we
don't
think
that's
right,
but
we
do
have
a
district
court
finding
to
that
effect.
now,
if
that's
true,
then
the
way
we
get
the
evidence
introduced
is
by
showing
that
the
consent
was
valid
on
the
part
of
arciniega.
arciniega
in
effect
did
what
the
matlock
case
indicates
could
be
done
in
this
situation.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
they
don't
if
they
did
not
retain
a
privacy
interest
in
the
trunk
of
the
car.
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
did--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--you
would
have
to
look
at
such
things
as
the
terms
of
the
bailment,
you
would
have
to
look
at
whether
in
the
view
of--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
the
officer
is
not
going
to
know
it,
and
typically
the
officer
will
be
in
a
position
of
having
apparent
authority
to
go
into
the
trunk,
so
even
if
the
person
who's
driving
the
car--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--doesn't
have
actual
authority,
he
may
have
apparent
authority.
but
the
key
here
is
that
if
there
is
a
retained
privacy
interest
in
the
trunk,
and
the
officers
coerce
the
individual
into
giving
up
his
right
to
go
into
the
trunk
and
force...
in
effect,
they
do
the
same
thing
as
if
they
had
simply
said,
out
of
the
way,
we're
going
to
jimmy
up
the
trunk
and
they
open
it
with
a
crowbar,
then
they
have
violated
privacy
interests
on
the
part
of
the
simpsons.
now--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--if
he
had...
if
he's
in
a
situation
where
it's
reasonable
for
the
officer
to
assume
that
somebody
who's
driving
a
car
has
authority
to
consent
to
the
search
of
the
trunk,
then
the
officer's
acted
reasonably
if
he
obtains
the
consent
in
a
valid
fashion.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
typically
it
will
be,
yes,
because
they
will
assume
that
somebody
who
is
driving
a
car
and
is
in
the
middle
of
the
highway
has
authority
to
go
into
the
trunk,
particularly
if
he's
been
given
the
keys,
as
was
the
case
here.
arciniega
had
the
key
to
the
trunk--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
we
think
we
do
win
if
this
court
wants
to
make
a
finding
with
respect
to
the
validity
of
the
consent.
it
can
do
it,
but
i...
that
is
typically
the
kind
of
thing
that
i
would
think
would
be
made
by
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance.
we're
not
saying
that
you
can't
reach
that
issue,
but
i'm
suggesting--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
if
the
officer--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--not--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--not
at
all,
if
the
police
get
a
valid
consent
from
the
person
that's
driving.
the
only
point
i'm
making,
and
i'm
not
making
it
very
clearly,
i'm
afraid,
but
the
only
point
is
that
if
the
officers
go
up
there
and
beat
a
consent
out
of
arciniega,
that's
not
reasonable
police
conduct,
and
they
are
therefore
not
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
search,
which
may
affect
what
turns
out
to
be
somebody
else's
privacy
interest
in
the
trunk.
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
only
because
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--exactly.
that's
why
apparent
authority
is
the
question
with
respect
to
the
officer's
perception
of
arciniega's
right
to
open
the
trunk.
if
the
officer
looks
at
this
man
who's
driving
down
the
highway
and
says,
anybody
in
this
situation
i'm
going
to
assume
has
authority
to
go
into
the
trunk,
that's
a
reasonable
conclusion,
and
that's
why
we
think
we
win
on
the
validity
of
the
consent.
that's
why
we
think
that
if
this
case
goes
back
to
the
district
court
we
will
prevail
on
the
question
of
whether
this
was
a
valid
consent,
because
as
this
court
said
in
illinois
v.
rodriguez,
the
question
of
reasonableness
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
the
apparent
authority
of
the
consenting
party
to
consent--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
would
have
said,
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
is
the
principal
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--if
we--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--you're
absolutely
right,
if
we
lose
on
the
joint
venture
theory
of
standing,
then
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
ownership
of
the
car
or
anything
to
do
with
the
car.
if
you
hold,
as
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
this
case
and
has
held
elsewhere,
that
all
you
need
is
a
sort
of
supervisory
and
control
role
in
the
conspiracy--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
exactly
right,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
what
i'm
arguing
is,
if
you
reject
that
broad
argument,
and
we
hope
you
do,
then
you
have
to
address,
we
think
you
should
address,
the
questions
that
are
raised
by--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--exactly.
we're...
if
you
rule
that
the
ninth
circuit's
joint
venture
exception,
if
we'll
call
it...
we'll
call
it
that,
is
correct,
and
that
all
you
need
is
to
have
supervisory
control--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--we
lose,
and
you
don't
have
to--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--exactly.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
we
have
won
as
to
the
padillas
except
for--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
the
merits,
and
the
court's
opinion
in
rakas
makes
the
point...
and
we
do
use
the
term,
standing,
but
technically
the
court
has
said
in
rakas
that
standing
really
is
just
a
proxy
for
talking
about
the
merits
of
whether
a
particular
individual
has
had
a
fourth
amendment
violation
of
his
personal
rights,
and
so
it
really
is
a
question
of
whether
there's
a
violation
of
the
particular
defendant's
rights.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
there
would
be
no
argument
that
the
simpsons
retained
a
privacy
interest.
setting
aside
the
possessory
interest--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
came
into
plain
view,
that's
true,
but
there's
no
continuing
privacy
interest--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
if
they
were
driving
they
would
have
standing.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
but
if
they're
not
driving,
absolutely,
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
our
position
is
that
if
they
leave
cocaine
in
the
front
seat
of
a
car,
then
the
only
fourth
amendment
event
that
occurs
that
amounts
to
anything
is
the
stop
of
the
car,
and
our
position
throughout
has
been
the
stop
of
the
car
does
not
violate
the
simpsons'
rights.
they
are
back
in
douglas,
or
whatever,
waiting
to
get
their
car
back
2
days
hence.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
they
want
the
money.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
they
don't
want
the
cocaine.
[laughter]
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
that
the
owner
could
decide
that
if
presented
with
the
question...
if
arciniega
were
to
call
back
on
the
phone,
car
phone
or
something,
to
the
simpsons
and
say,
should
i
let
these
officers
take
this
car--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
but
they
let
him
have
it
for
a
couple
of
days,
and
our
point
is
that
when
there
is
an
interference
with
his
exercise
of
control,
which
is
what
they
have
ceded.
they've
not
ceded--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
they
have,
we
think,
ceded
the
right
to,
for
example,
stop
the
car
at
some
point
on
the
highway
and
get
some
lunch,
they've
ceded--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
the
only
thing
that
arciniega...
the
only
way
in
which
arciniega...
arciniega
was
affected.
the
only
way
the
simpsons
was
affected...
as
far
as
they
were
concerned,
no
event
occurred
that
affected
their
continuing
enjoyment
of
the
use
of
the
property--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that's
true,
but
what
our
point
is
is
that
their
right,
their
property
right
in
the
car
that
they
have
given
to
somebody
else
is
limited,
we
think,
to
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--if
there
were
a
traffic
stop,
i
don't
think
so,
no,
because
the
owner--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--an
illegal
traffic
stop.
no,
because
the
owner,
again...
the
owner's
property--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no,
the
owner
in
that
case
hasn't
consented
to
anything,
but
also
a
5-minute
stop
doesn't
constitute
a
meaningful
interference
with
the
owner's
possessory
rights.
there
is
already--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
if
you
lease
the
property
to
somebody
for
5
days
and
the
government
comes
in--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
you...
there
has
been
a
seizure
of
property,
but
your
rights
are
not
affected.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
but
you
have,
we
think,
waived
in
effect,
unless
you've
put
some
kind
of
specific
prohibition
against
any--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--at
least
in
a
case
like
this,
when
arciniega,
so
far
as
the
record
reflects,
has
not
given
any--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--if
there
is
a...
you
could
have
a
prohibition
against
some
further
disposition.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
reason
it's
not
so,
your
honor
is
because
the
ninth
circuit
in
our
view
focused
on
the
wrong
thing.
they
focused
on
the
role
of
the
defendants
in
the
commission
of
the
crime.
they
should
have
focused
on
whether
the
defendant's
particular
fourth
amendment
interests
were
violated.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
we
don't
think...
well,
if
they're
interrelated,
we
focus
on
the
way
in
which
the
fourth
amendment
right
was
affected.
in
a
case
like
this,
what
the
ninth
circuit
is
saying
in
effect
is
that
mr.
big,
whether
it's
the
head
of
the
whole
conspiracy
who's
back
in
mexico
who's
saying,
i
want
those
drugs
to
get
to
los
angeles
and
i
want
the
money
back,
has
standing
just
as
much
as
any
other
defendant
in
this
case.
because
the
ninth
circuit,
under
the
ninth
circuit's
theory
if
you
have
supervisory
authority
and
control
over
the
transaction
as
a
whole,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
somebody
invades
your
property
or
somebody
conducts
a
search
of
premises
in
which
you
have
an
expectation
of
privacy.
if
you
have
neither
of
those...
you
have
neither
possessory
or
ownership
interests
in
the
property
nor
privacy
interests,
you
still
have
standing
under
the
ninth
circuit's
theory
because
you
have
control
of
the
transaction.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
what
they
said,
and--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--of
course,
you
could
say
that
with
respect
to
the...
to
mr.
big,
back
in
mexico.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
we
think
they're
clearly
not--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
they
concluded
that
that
interest
was
based
on
their
criminal
joint
venture,
but
that
would
be
applicable
to
everyone
down
to
and
including
the
principal--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--in
the
enterprise,
and
we
think
that
just
departs
by
leagues
from
this
court's
focus.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
the
major
issue,
yes.
i'd
like...
thank
you.
