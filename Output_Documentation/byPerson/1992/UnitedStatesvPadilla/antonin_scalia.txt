suppose
the
government
had
loaned...
suppose
the
car
had
been
loaned
for
a
week,
and
the
government
seized
it
and
then
kept
it
for
only
6
days,
couldn't
you
say
the
same
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
their
privacy
interest
in
the
car?
i
mean,
what
if
they
had
confidential
information
in
the
glove
compartment
and
they're
willing
to
trust
mr.
padilla
with
that,
but
they're
not
particularly
willing
to
trust
the
government
with
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
possession
and
privacy
go
together.
i
mean,
the
possessory
interest
is
a
substitute
for
privacy.
it's
the
main
way
by
which
privacy
is
protected
in
goods.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
have
to
be
possessory
rights?
there's
no
seizure
unless
my
possessory
rights...
so
if
i
lease
property
to
someone,
the
government
can
walk
in
and
seize
that
property
and
no
right
of
mine
has
been
affected?
there's
been
no
seizure
of
property
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
5
years.
the
government
comes
in
and
takes
it
and
says,
i'm
sorry,
i
know
you
leased
it
to
x,
but
we're
going
to
take
it
over...
you
know,
it's
a
problem
for
x,
it's
no
problem
for
you...
and
i
say,
but
i
didn't
lease
it
to
the
united
states,
i
leased
it
to
x,
get
out
of
here,
is
what
i
would
say.
you
haven't
seized
my
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
my...
but
my
right
to
property
includes
the
right
to
exclude.
doesn't
it
include
the
right
to
exclude?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
choose
not
to
exclude
one
person,
i
waive
the
right
to
exclude
the
rest
of
the
world.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
you
say
so,
in
a
case
like
this,
but
i
don't
know
why
a
case
like
this
is
different
from
any
other
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
nash,
the
question
presented
in
the
government's
petition
for
certiorari
plainly
raises
the
joint
venture
issue
and
nothing
else,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
membership
in
a
joint
venture
to
transport
drugs
gives
coconspirators
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
your
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
confronts
that
joint
venture
theory
head
on.
i
do
not
read
it
as
saying
there's
no
joint
venture
issue
in
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
the
briefs
of
counsel.
i'm
talking
about
your
opposition.
did
you
make
the
argument
in
your
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
that
you're
now
making,
namely
that
the
question
presented
is
not
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
can
answer
this
question
yes
or
no.
did
anybody
raise
the
issue
that
the
question
presented
is
not
in
the
case?
not
that
there's
another
issue
in
the
case,
but
that
this
issue
is
not
in
the
case,
which
is
what
you're
now
telling
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
did
he
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
show
me
where
on
page
10?
i
have
page
10,
and
i
don't
see
anything
that
says
the
issue
is
not
in
the
case.
maybe
i
have
the
wrong
page
10,
but
i
don't
see
it.
i
mean,
it's
an
important
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
what
we
were
going
to
talk
about
today,
and
you
tell--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
the
issue
i'm
talking
about
is
a
contention
which
you
have
made,
not
that
there
is
an
additional
issue,
but
that
this
issue
is
not
in
the
case,
that
the
issue
on
which
we
granted
certiorari
is
not
in
the
case.
that's
what
you've
told
us.
you've
said
that
issue
is
not
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
show
me
where
that
appears
in
anybody's
brief,
or
otherwise
say,
as
far
as
you
know,
it
does
not
appear
in
anybody's
opposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
quite
different
point.
you're
saying
there's
an
additional
issue
here.
there's
a
difference
between
the
joint
venture
issue
and
the
possession
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
the
point
you
were
making.
you
were
making
the
point
that
the
joint
venture
issue
is
not
in
the
case.
now,
do
you
still
make
that
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
it
is
in
the
case.
