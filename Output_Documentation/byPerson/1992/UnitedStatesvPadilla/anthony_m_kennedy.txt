justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
do
you
say
that
we
have
to
remand
in
this
case?
is
that
the
best
result
you
can
hope
for?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
difference
does
it
make
if...
to
the
simpsons'
interest
if
mr.
arciniega's
consent
is
valid
or
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
think--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--go
ahead.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
my
suggestion
is
that
even
if
the
consent
is
invalid
as
to
arciniega,
the
simpsons
get
no
benefit
from
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay,
now
tell
me
about
how
we
go
about
determining
whether
they
retain
a
privacy
interest
in
the
right
of
the
car.
do
we
have
to
look
at
the
terms
of
the
bailment--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
at
the
criminal
enterprise,
as
the
ninth
circuit
suggested?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
is
the
officer
to
know
this
when
he
makes
his
stop?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
driver
would
have.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
understand
how
an
officer
is
supposed
to
know
whether
someone
else
has
retained
privacy
interests
in
the
trunk.
do
you
just
take
your
chances
when
you
open
a
trunk
with
someone's
consent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
reasonable
for
officers
to
do
that
if
they
know
someone
else
owns
the
car?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
why
don't
you
win?
why
do
we
have
to
remand?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
confused
as
to
how
we
determine
if
someone...
some
third-person
owner
has
some
retained
privacy
interest
in
the
trunk.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
an
officer
acts
reasonably,
and
whether
this
is
a
legitimate
interest
that
we're
prepared
to
recognize
or
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
some
third...
we
can
assume
that
most
cars
riding
around
out
there
have
third
persons'
property
interest
in
them.
i
don't
think
that
prevents
the
police
from
stopping
the
car--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
bryson,
i
see
the
white
light's
on.
i'd
certainly
like
to
hear
about
the
ninth
circuit's
theory.
it
seems
to
me
that
once
you
say
that
it
depends
upon
the
terms
of
the
bail
that
was
given,
that
the
ninth
circuit's
theory
begins
to
have
some
plausibility.
why
is
that
not
so?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
two
are
interrelated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
does
a
policeman
know
that
he's
either
searching
or
seizing
when
he
stops
to
question
a
suspect
who's
driving
an
automobile?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
obviously
been
a
detention
of
the
property.
does
that
automatically
mean
there's
a
seizure?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
stop
were
lawful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
then--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
then
it's
not
just
a
question
of
seizure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
seems
to
me,
first
things
first,
because
you've
conceded
that
if
the
stop
were
lawful
and
the
consent
were
lawful,
then
there
would
be
no
question
of
seizure--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
i
question
the
district
court's
and
the
ninth
circuit's
approach.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
arciniega
was
going
90
miles
an
hour,
and
he
was
stopped...
a
valid
stop,
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
police
said,
may
we
search
the
trunk
of
your
car,
and
he
said,
yes.
is
that
a
valid
search?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
at
that
point,
isn't
the
case
over
and
the
simpsons
lose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why,
then,
isn't
this
a
search
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
standing
do
the
simpsons
have
to
raise
the
violations
of
arciniega's
rights--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--when
he's
been
invalidly
stopped?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
both
of
those
cases,
one
was
federal
express,
the
other
an
airline.
it
was
open
and
obviously
clear
that
this
was
a
bailment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
are
you
saying
that
any
time
the
police
stop
an
automobile
and
find
that
it's
registered
to
a
different
owner
that
there
can
be
no
consent
given
by
the
driver?
