mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it
is
important
at
the
outset
to
recognize
that
this
is
not
a
search
case,
but
a
seizure
case.
district
judge
billby's
ruling
in
this
case
was
limited
to
the
invalid
initial
seizure
of
the
car.
he
never
reached
the
merits
of
the
search
questions,
except
insofar
as
to
find
that
they
were
tainted
by
that
invalid
initial
seizure
of
the
car,
but
the
merits
of
the
consent,
the
merits
of
the
trunk
search
and
all
of
the
other
activities
that
occurred
after
the
invalid
seizure,
are
not
at
issue
here,
they
were
not
at
issue
in
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--he
always--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--yes,
sir.
under
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
and
delaware
v.
prouse
is
perhaps
the
most
cited
one,
the
stopping
of
a
vehicle
even
for
merely
checking
a
driver's
license
and
registration
is
most
definitely
a
seizure
of
the
automobile,
its
driver,
and
all
of
the
contents.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
exactly.
that
is
the--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--that's
the
issue.
that's
the
issue
before
the
court.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
under
that
hypothetical,
that's
correct.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
but
both
mr.
padilla
and
mr.
and
mrs.
simpson
had
a
possessory
or
property
right
in
both
the
car
and
its
contents.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
if
the
initial
stop
were
lawful--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--then
the
issue
as
to
the
seizure
of
the
car
would
not
be
subject
to
further
argument.
the
issue
would
then
turn
to--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--well,
the
way
the
question
is
postured
to
this
court,
it
is,
because
the
only
issue
that
was
ruled
on
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
ninth
circuit
was
the
seizure
of
the
car,
not
the
consent,
not
the
other
things,
except
insofar
as
they
were
tainted.
there
has
been
no
hearing
on
the
merits
of
that
consent,
about
the
trunk
search,
or
the
other
issues.
district
judge
billby
was
very
clear
in
saying,
i
will
not
reach
those
things
because
the
issue
of
the
invalid
initial
seizure
is
a
case-dispositive
ruling.
under
soldal,
the
interest
that
needs
to
be--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--under
that--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--well,
we
always
have
to
begin
with
the
first
level
of
intrusion,
and
the
first
level
of
intrusion
is
almost
always
the
stopping
of
the
vehicle
or
the
person.
if,
indeed,
that
level
of
intrusion
is
deemed
to
be
valid,
we
then
turn
to
the
other
intrusions...
the
search,
a
subsequent
seizure
if,
indeed,
there's
one
after
the
car's
first
stop.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
because
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
was
mr.
strubbe
had
not
claimed
and
could
never
show
any
possessory
interest
in
either
the
contraband
or
in
the
vehicle,
nor
could
he
show,
or
did
he
attempt
to
show,
any
right
to
privacy.
what
the
ninth
circuit
has
said...
and
i
would
take
issue
with
government's
counsel's
characterization
of
the
joint
venture
rule,
which
i
don't
think
you
should
reach
in
this
case,
but--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--the
rule
is
not
mere
membership
in
a
joint
venture,
ipso
facto,
confers
standing
on
a
litigant.
what
it
says,
simply,
is
that
a
court
will
quite
properly
analyze
the
relationships
of
the
parties
to
each
other
to
the
property
seized
or
the
property
or
place
that
was
searched.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
it
does,
and
let
me
suggest
to
the
court
two
reasons
why
it
does,
and
first
of
all,
it
is
clear
that
the
ninth
circuit
does
not
go
off
solely
on
an
expectation
of
privacy.
the
decision
is
also
replete
with
citations
to
the
possessory
interest
and
property
rights
of
mr.
and
mrs.
simpson
and
mr.
padilla,
not
only
in
the
car,
but
also
in
the
contraband,
in
the
contents
of
the
car.
the
ninth
circuit
does
talk
about
right
to
privacy
for
two
reasons.
number
1,
in
the
appeal
in
the
ninth
circuit,
the
only
issue
raised
by
the
government
in
that
case
was
the
right
to
privacy.
they
never
challenged
the
possessory
interest
of
the
property
right
allegations
in
the
district
court.
point
number
2
is,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
ninth
circuit,
perhaps
like
the
seventh
circuit
before
soldal,
improperly
blended
a
right-to-privacy
analysis
and
the
consideration
of
a
seizure.
in
jacobsen,
this
court
recognized
that
the
issue
of
seizure
turns
on
property
rights,
not
right
to
privacy,
and
that
was
made
even
more
clear
by
justice
white's
recent
opinion
in
soldal.
a
right-to-privacy
analysis
simply
has
no
place
in
a
seizure
case.
it
applies
in
a
search
case.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
it
does
two
things.
number
1,
the
briefs
of
counsel
do
very
definitely
say
this
is
a
seizure,
and
under
soldal,
which
was
decided
just
days--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--mr.
padilla's
opposition
did
not
squarely
raise
it.
mr.
simpson's
did
raise...
his
prose
opposition
did
in
fact
raise
the
issue
of
property
rights
as
being
different
from
a
right
to
privacy.
however--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--mr.
simpson
did
in
his
opposition.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
his
counsel
has
indicated
to
me
that
it's
found
at
page
10
of
his
prose
opposition
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
also,
i
would
suggest
to
you,
justice
scalia,
that
if
the
seventh
circuit
was
mistaken
and
confused
in
its
proper
application
of
whether
or
not
right-to-privacy
analysis
applied
in
the
seizure
case,
which
it
was,
and
the
decision
there
that
was
clarified
by
this
court
in
soldal,
if
they
were
mistaken,
then
both
the
ninth
circuit
and
perhaps
counsel
that
were
involved
in
the
application
of
that
test
could
also
have
been
mistaken.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
i'm
looking
at--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--i'm
looking
at
page
10.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
page
10,
which
starts...
the
paragraph
beginning
at
line
24,
"in
addition
to
erroneously
overlooking
the
important
difference
between
privacy
interest
and
possessory
interest.
"
and
it
goes
on
to
cite
jacobsen
and
talk
about
that.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
that
is
the
square
issue
that
we're
talking
about.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
if
this
is
a
seizure
case--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--to
say
that,
in
the
opposition
of
mr.
simpson
to
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
that
the
government
overlooks
the
difference
between
a
seizure
which
doesn't
involve
a
right
to
privacy,
that
is
the
issue.
that
is
the
point
that
we
are
raising.
further--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--yes.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
what
i
am
saying
is
that--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--yes,
sir,
it
is
in
the
case.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
it's
raised
in
the
case.
it
ought
not
to
be,
that
is
my
argument.
if
this
is
in
fact
a
seizure
case,
then
under
soldal
a
right-to-privacy
analysis
does
not
apply,
and
the
question
that
the
government
sought
certiorari
on
is
what
role,
if
any,
should
a
joint
venture
standing
issue
play
in
determining
right
to
privacy?
under
soldal
and
under
jacobsen,
if
this
is
a
seizure
case,
right-to-privacy
analysis
doesn't
apply.
we
are
claiming
a
possessory
interest
or
proprietary
interest
in
both
the
car
and
the
contraband
under
two
separate
theories.
number
1...
excuse
me,
under
two
separate
theories,
one
of
which
is
car,
and
one
is
the
contents.
the
government's
claim
in
this
court
is
that
an
absent
owner
can
never
properly
claim
a
possessory
interest
in
an
automobile,
and
that
simply
has
not
been
the
law
in
this
court
or
in
any
other.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
no,
sir,
because
that
overlooks
the
interest
in
a
possessory
right
to
the
contraband.
further,
mr.
padilla
at
the
district
court
level
claimed
a
bailment-type
interest
as
well
in
the
vehicle,
so
the
issue
of
ownership
of
the
car
strictly
pivots
around
mr.
and
mrs.
simpson,
but
in
the
district
court
mr.
padilla
claimed
a
bailment
interest
in
the
car.
it
was
he
to
whom
the
car
was
entrusted
to
transport
the
cocaine
on
the
next
leg
of
its
journey.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
if
under
that
hypothetical,
which
is
not
this
case,
you
would
be
correct.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
under
that
hypothetical,
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
but
the
simpsons
are
clearly
the
owner
of
the
car.
in
your
hypothetical
the
owner
of
the
car
was
driving
it.
mr.
and
mrs.
simpson
clearly
have
the
ability
and
the
standing
to
challenge
the
invalidity
of
the
initial
seizure
of
that
car.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
just--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--and
assuming
the
validity
of
the
consent,
which
is
an
issue
that
has
to
get,
perhaps,
sent
back
to
the
district
court.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
if
we
assume
also
the
validity
of
the
consent,
yes,
it
is.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
yes.
if
we
assume--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--because
this
case,
number
1,
involves
a
search
that
is,
by
the
government's
own
tacit
admission
by
not
challenging
it
on
appeal,
invalid.
the
district
judge
found
that
there
is
absolutely
no
objective,
articulable
fact
to
support
the
stop.
that
is
the
first
difference.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
because
it
was--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--because
it
was
their
car,
sir,
and
they
also
had
a
possessory
interest
in
the
contraband.
clearly,
if
one
has
a
possessory
interest
in
a
vehicle,
even
though
one
happens
to
be
absent
at
the
time
of
the
stop,
you
are
not
deprived
of
your
ability
to
contest
the
fourth
amendment
violation.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
they
do
not
for
standing
purposes.
they
do
for
forfeiture,
or
for
other
seizure
purposes
for
purposes
of
forfeiture,
but
not
in
standing.
that
argument
has
been
squarely
rejected
by
this
court
every
time
it's
been
raised.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
trupiano
was
one
of
the
ones
that's
cited
in
the
briefs.
it
says
it
makes
no
difference
if
the
object
seized
is
contraband
or
not,
there
is
still
a
proper
fourth
amendment
interest.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
but
not
squarely
on
that
point.
there
is
no
case
that
the
government
has
cited
to
this
court
that
says
in
a
search
and
seizure
context
that
one
loses
standing
to
raise
a
possessory
interest
or
right
to
privacy
simply
because
contraband
is
involved.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
jeffers
also
says
the
same
thing.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
but
they
could
have
a
possessory
interest
in
it.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
but
possession
does
not
require
ownership,
it
merely
requires
a
measure
of
control
and
intent
to
control.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
by
merely
possessing
it.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
it
can
be
found
from
title.
it
is
not
necessarily
limited--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--you
can
get
it
from
someone
bailing
it
to
you.
you
can
get
it
from
a
temporary
bailment
interest.
it
does
not
require
any
type
of
ownership,
and
i
would--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--well,
the
bailor--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--if
this
court
chooses
to
find
that
one
can
never,
as
a
matter
of
law,
have
a
possessory
interest
in
contraband,
then
your
hypothetical
is
correct.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
well,
one
can
possess
something,
my
argument
is,
without
necessary
owning
it.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
the
government
urges
that
an
absentee
owner
can
never
claim
any
type
of
proper
possessory
interest,
and
with
regard
to
the
vehicle
and
with
the
contraband,
once
we
assume
the
correctness
of
my
position
on
the
possession
versus
ownership
issue,
it's
simply
not
valid.
in
jacobsen,
this
court
found
that
an
individual
had
a
cognizable
fourth
amendment
interest
that
was
affected
by
a
seizure
even
though
they
clearly
were
not
present
at
the
time
the
package
was
seized.
in
place,
the
same
kind
of
situation
arose.
the
precise
seizure
in
place
that
was
the
subject
of
this
court's
inquiry
occurred
at
a
time
when
mr.
place
had
been
allowed
to
leave
the
airport,
was
not
present,
and
was
not
involved
in
any
of
those
activities.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
that's
clear,
and
that's--
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
--that
is
exactly
this
case,
with
even
more
control
exerted
over
the
bailee
by
the
bailor
than
was
found
in
the
federal
express
example.
mr.
walter
b.
nash,
iii
absolutely
not,
sir.
we
are
not
saying
that
mr.
arciniega's
consent,
assuming,
number
1
the
validity
of
the
initial
seizure
of
the
car,
and
number
2
assuming
the,
on
its
merits,
if
you
will,
validity
of
the
consent,
is
not
binding
on
anyone
else.
it
would
be.
it
would
be
binding
on
everyone
else
who
claimed
an
ownership
or
possessory
interest
in
the
car,
but
the
vice
of
your
hypothetical
is
that
it
assumes
two
facts
that
are
not
in
this
case,
one
a
finding
of
validity
of
the
initial
seizure,
number
2,
some
type
of
ruling
on
the
merits
in
favor
of
the
government
in
the
issue
of
consent,
neither
of
which
exist
in
this
case.
but
clearly,
if
we
assume
those
two
things,
the
person
who
is
driving
the
car,
who
is
properly
empowered
to
drive
it,
can
issue
a
consent
under
this
court's
prior
decisions
that
is
binding
on
anyone
else.
that
is
not
at
issue
here.
the
point
that
i
was
making
that
the
prior
case
law
of
this
court
clearly
establishes
that
one
may
be
absent
and
still
have
the
right
to
complain
about
a
seizure.
the
issue
of
absence
clearly
more
appropriately
affects
the
issue
of
right
to
privacy.
simply
put,
if
i
have
an
interest
in
property
and
someone
trespasses
on
that
property,
whether
or
not
i
know
about
it
or
i
am
present,
i
still
have
an
interest
that
has
been
offended,
an
interest
that
would
give
me
a
right
to
complain
about
that,
and
it
is
no
different
when
one
considers
standing.
the
government
makes
much
to
do
in
the
written
briefs
filed
in
this
case
concerning
the
issue
of
minimal
intrusion
versus
more
than
minimal
intrusion.
traditionally,
this
court
has
analyzed
the
issue
of
minimal
intrusion
versus
more
than
minimal
intrusion
as
to
the
level
of
finding
that
the
government
has
to
make,
the
kind
of
showing
they
have
to
make
to
justify
the
initial
seizure.
if
it
is
merely
a
minimal
intrusion
and
counterplayed
against
a
strong
prevailing
governmental
interest,
then
the
kind
of
showing
the
government
has
to
make
is
merely
reasonable
suspicion.
if
it
is
more
than
a
minimal
intrusion,
probable
cause
is
required.
what
the
government
seeks
to
do
here
is
bootstrap
that
argument
to
the
next
level,
and
what
they
seek
to
do
is
say
that
in
the
case
of
a
minimal
intrusion
no
articulable
objective
facts
need
be
shown,
not
even
reasonable
suspicion.
that
really
is
the
thrust
of
their
argument
here.
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
in
this
case
the
record
is
very
clear
and
unequivocal
that
there
was
no
fact,
no
specific
articulable
fact,
that
could
support
the
initial
detention
of
the
car
in
this
case,
so
the
government
wants
to
take
the
minimal
cases
to
the
next
level,
which,
i
would
submit,
is
simply
not
justified
on
the
facts
of
this
case
or
any
prior
precedent
in
this
court.
if
we
look
at
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
is
a
case
limited
to
a
seizure,
then
the
joint
venture
rule
as
it
determines
one's
right
to
privacy
has
no
place
in
the
analysis,
and
what
the
ninth
circuit
may
have
done
is
the
same
thing
that
the
seventh
circuit
did
in
soldal.
it
has
improperly
considered
one's
right
to
privacy
in
determining
the
propriety
of
a
seizure
rather
than
a
search.
this
case
is
a
seizure
case,
and
hopefully
soldal,
as
it
did
in
the
seventh
circuit,
will
clear
up
this
issue
and
provide
guidance
to
counsel
and
courts
that
the
proper
measure
of
inquiry
is
not
right
to
privacy
but
is,
instead,
property
rights.
this
is
a
seizure
case.
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
