justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
bryson,
the
question
presented
in
your
cert
petition
says
nothing
about
ownership
as
a
justification.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
probably
should,
but
you
said
nothing
about
it
and
you
relied
entirely
on
the
joint
venture
rationale
in
your
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
only
question
you
asked.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
they
gave
additional
reasons,
but
you
didn't
challenge
one
of
those
reasons.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
the
question
directed
at
one
part
of
the
analysis
gives
you
license
to
just
challenge
anything
about
the
judgment
you
want.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
didn't
challenge
that
part
of
their
reasoning,
is
my
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
the
government
take
the
position
that
the
ownership
of
a
car
does
not
give
the
owner
a
right
to
challenge
the
seizure
of
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes
and
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
deny
that
a
stop
is
a
seizure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
was
it
a
seizure
of
the
car?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
owner
doesn't
have
standing
to
challenge
it
because
it
didn't
hurt
him
right
at
the
time,
is
that
the
point?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
mr.
simpson--
--except
for
that--
--go
ahead.
oh,
i'm
sorry.
if
you
win
on
that
point,
though,
you
have
won
as
to
the
padillas.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
arguably,
since
you
didn't
raise
the
question
as
to
the
others,
maybe
we
should
dismiss
that
part
of
the
case
as
improperly
granted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
primary
argument
as
to
the
simpsons
goes
to
this
whole
ownership
question,
which
is
entirely
different
from
what
i
thought
we
were
granting
when
we
granted
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
even
your
argument
in
your
brief
doesn't
even
talk
about
standing.
it
talks
about
whether
there
should
be
suppression,
which
is
a
distinct
issue
whether
you
win
on
the
merits.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.--
--may
i
go
back
just
a
second
to
your
hypotheticals?
you
went
by
part
of
it
so
fast.
you
said
that
if
there
was
a
stop
and
the
owners
had
standing
to
object
to
the
stop
and
the
stop's
illegal,
that
if
the
cocaine
were
sitting
in
the
front
seat
where
it
became...
it
was
in
plain
view
after
the
stop--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
would
be
clearly...
there
would
clearly
be
no
standing,
if
i
understood
you
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
because
they...
because
it
came
into
plain
view
as
a
result
of
what
you've
conceded
was
an
illegal
stop.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
would
you
say
that
they
have
no
standing
to
object
to
the
seizure
of
the
cocaine
after
their
car
was
illegally
stopped
and
therefore
it
became
visible,
is
that
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
they're
not
driving.
