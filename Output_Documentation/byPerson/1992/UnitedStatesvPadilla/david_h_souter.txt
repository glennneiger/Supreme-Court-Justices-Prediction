justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
you--
--mr.
bryson,
let
me
go
back,
if
i
may,
to
your
argument
that
the
simpsons
do
not
have
any
property
right
that
was
infringed,
and
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
if
the
simpsons
have
consented,
or
the
owner
has
consented
to
another
person's
having
possession
and
the
stop
occurs
during
the
period
of
that
consented
possession,
that
there
is
no
property
interest
that
the
simpsons
or
that
the
owners
can
assert.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
is
simply
identifying
all
ownership
interests
with
simply
possession
at
the
time,
and
the
fact
is
the
simpsons
have
not,
in
any
way
that
i
can
see,
given
away
their
right
to
control
as
owners
of
the
car
who
will
have
that
possession,
and
they,
in
effect
have
said
you
the
driver
can
have
it.
they
certainly
have
not
said
the
united
states
government
can
interfere
with
it,
and
so
i
don't
see
why
the
mere
fact
that
a
third
party
has
possession
with
the
owner's
consent
precludes
the
owner,
in
effect,
from
asserting
a
different
ownership
right.
that
is
to
say,
the
power
to
decide
who
in
fact
will
have
access
to
that
car,
and
who
will
be
able
to
stop
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
does
he
have
to
do
that?
the
only
thing
we
know
is
that
the
simpsons
let
arciniega
have
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
no
implication
there
that
they
are
consenting
to
or
giving
permission
to
anyone
else
to
perform
any
act
which
interferes
with
the
automobile.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no,
they
haven't
ceded
all
exercise
of
control.
they've
ceded
the
control
of
the
car
to
him
to
the
extent
that
it's
necessary
for
him
to
control...
to
have
control
to
drive
the
car,
but
they
haven't
ceded
anything
else.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
because
that's
a
normal
incident
of
the
possession
which
they
have
given
to
him,
but
they
haven't,
certainly,
ceded
anything
to
a
third
party,
which
is
what
we're
concerned
with
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
simply...
the
only...
it
did
not
affect
their
possession
at
the
moment
because
they
did
not
have
possession.
that
is
the
only
thing
you
can
say.
justice
david
h.
souter
jeffers,
okay.
of
course,
you
have
a
more
difficult
problem,
don't
you,
than
simply...
at
least
on
behalf
of
the
simpsons...
than
simply
asserting
what
you
described
as
a
possessory
interest,
because
you've
got
to...
they
would
have
to
base
their
claim
there
on
constructive
possession.
they
did
not,
in
fact,
have
possession
of
the
drugs,
and
it's...
i
would
have
thought
that
the
theory
on
which
you
get
constructive
possession,
one
element
of
which
is
the
right
to
control
the
dominion
over
something,
the
right
to
dispose
of
it,
is
essentially
a
theory
of
property
or
ownership,
and
they
do
not
have
any
ownership
in
contraband.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that
begs
the
question.
they
don't
have
a
possessory
interest
in
the
sense
of
having
present
possession.
the
only
possessory
interest
they
can
have
is
a
constructive
possessory
interest,
and
if
a
constructive
possessory
interest
implies
title
or
ownership,
which
in
fact
is
precluded
in
contraband,
it
may
be
that
as
to
contraband
the
only
kind
of
possessory
interest
that
can
give
standing
is
a
present
possessory
interest
as
opposed
to
a
constructive
one,
which
is
what
the
simpsons
have
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
and
what's...
where
do
you
get
the
power
to
control
something
which
you
do
not
have
in
your
physical
possession
if
you
do
not,
in
fact,
own
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they're
not...
no,
but
that
begs
the
question.
that's
just
circular.
you
admit
that
they
don't
have
any
present
physical
possession,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
they
have
what
we
traditionally
refer
to
as
constructive
possession,
if
anything,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
an
element
of
constructive
possession
that
you
must
have
a...
some
sort
of
right
to
exercise
dominion
and
control,
even
though
it
is
not
in
your
presence?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
do
we
not
usually
find
that
right
to
exercise
dominion
control
in
title
or
property
to
the
goods
or
to
the
object
in
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
where
else
do
you
get
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
just
pushes
the
difficulty
further
off,
because
the
bailor
doesn't
have
any
possession
at
that
point--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
if
the
bailor's
only
possession
is
constructive,
then
you've
got
the
same
problem
with
the
bailor
that
you
have
if
you
deal
with
people
in
the
simpsons'
position
right
now.
it
just
kind
of
adds
another
layer
of
constructive
possession
to
the
analysis.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
we
have
to
find,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
you
may
not
have
title
or
ownership
in
contraband,
and
i
thought
that's
where
we
were
at
the
present
time.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
agree
with
you.
