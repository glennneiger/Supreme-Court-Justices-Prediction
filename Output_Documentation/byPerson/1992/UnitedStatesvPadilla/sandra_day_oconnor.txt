mr.
bryson,
the
ninth
circuit,
as
you've
described,
went
off
on
some
notion
of
standing--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--acquired
to
address
the
privacy
concerns
of
the
fourth
amendment
by
virtue
of
the
joint
venture.
if
we
were
to
think
that
that
was
not
the
proper
focus,
the
briefs
in
the
case
address
the
new
argument
here
that
well,
in
any
event,
there's
standing
because
of
the
property--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--at
least,
the
possessory
interest.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
do
we
have
to
deal
with
that
here,
or
should
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
bryson,
i
thought
that
the
respondents
say
that
there
wasn't
consent
here.
was
that
issue
dealt
with
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we're
not
in
a
position--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
answer
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
you
would
acknowledge
that
based
on
the
district
court's
finding
that
the
simpsons
had
a
privacy
interest
in
the
trunk,
and
the
question
of
consent
is
open.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
bryson,
what
if
the
car
had...
what
if
arciniega
had
stolen
the
car
and
was
carrying
drugs
in
it.
now,
could
the...
and
it
had
drugs
in
the
trunk
that
arciniega
didn't
put
there,
the
owner
did.
now,
could
the
owner
complain
there?
would
the
owner
have
standing
if
there
were
an
illegal
traffic
stop?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
an
illegal
stop.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
owner
hasn't
consented
to
anything.
