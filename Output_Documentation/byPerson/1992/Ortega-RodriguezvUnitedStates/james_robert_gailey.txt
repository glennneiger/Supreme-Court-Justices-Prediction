mr.
james
robert
gailey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
and
the
petitioner
now
agree
that
a
former,
fugitive
from
sentencing
does
not,
automatically
forfeit
his
right
to
challenge
his
conviction
on
appeal.
the
only
issue
left
for
this
court
to
decide
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
abused
its
discretion
in
denying
petitioner
his
access
to
appeal.
we
say
it
did,
for
three
reasons:
one,
there
was
no
prejudice--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--yes,
your
honor,
we
do
agree
that
undertaking
a
case-by-case
analysis,
in
the
proper
case,
may
result
in
a
dismissal
of
an
appeal.
this
is
through
the
court's
inherent
powers
to
regulate
its
own
affairs.
we
do
not
believe
that
the...
the
automatic
rule,
as
the
eleventh
circuit
employs,
is
a
proper
exercise
of
those
supervisory
powers,
and
consequently,
in
this
case
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
have
allowed
the
appeal
to
go
forward.
the
three
reasons
why
we
believe--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--i
do...
i
do
not
believe,
justice
scalia,
that
the
court,
in
exercising
its
supervisory
powers
can
have
any
automatic
rule.
congress
has
conferred
jurisdiction
upon
the
appellate
courts
to
hear
such
appeals.
the
court,
in
exercising
its
supervisory
powers...
that
is,
powers
that
are
necessary
for
the
courts
to
function...
have,
from
time
to
time...
and
including
cases
in
front
of
this
court...
have
dismissed
appeals.
so
it
is
the
petitioner's--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--your
honor,
that
is
ordinary
precedent.
the
problem
that
petitioner
has
with
that
approach
to
the
problem,
though,
is
that
congress
has
conferred
the
jurisdiction...
not
the
courts.
the
courts
cannot
limit
their
own
jurisdiction
but
for
an
exercise
of
these
inherent
powers
that
the
courts
have.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
yes,
and
the
reason
why
is
that
congress
conferred
the
jurisdiction.
congress
can
limit
it...
as
this
court,
faced
with
a
texas
legislative
decision
in
estelle
v.
dorrough,
where
the
texas
legislature
limited
the
legislatively
granted
right
to
appeal.
we
do
believe
that
the
discretionary
analysis
in
this
case
was
abused
for
three
reasons.
and
these
three
reasons
are
ones
that
historically
courts
have
looked
at
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not,
in
its
discretion,
and
in
the
exercises
of
its
supervisory
powers,
a
court
ought
to
decline
to
hear
an
appeal.
those
three
grounds
are:
no
prejudice...
prejudice
in
the
appellate
court;
prejudiced
into
potential
post-appellate
proceedings;
and
the
vindication
of
the
court's
authority.
in
this
case,
under
the
analysis
of
all
three
of
those
factors,
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
not
to
have
gone
forward
with
the
appeal.
so
on
factor
number
one...
prejudice
to
the
appellate
court...
there
was
none.
this
issue
on
appeal--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--if
someone
absconds
while
his
appeal
is
pending,
as
this
court
reasoned
in
a
line
of
cases
beginning
with
smith--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--yes,
your
honor,
but
the--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--well,
except
that
the
court
always...
when
they
made
the
determination,
they
did
not
exercise
it
in
an
automatic
fashion.
this
court,
while
it
looked
at
fugitives
during
an
appeal
pending,
and
expressed
concerns
about...
ah--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--this
court
never...
well...
this
court,
nevertheless,
undertook
such
analysis.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
robert
gailey
the
class
being
fugitive--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--the
class
that
your
honor
is
referring
to
is
the
case
where
the
fugitives
are
pending
appeal...
out,
pending
appeal.
the
court
has
ruled
on
cases
where
fugitives
have
been
fugitives
at
the
time
appeal
was
pending.
however,
in
those
cases,
the
court
was
reversing
a
favorable
result
at
the
court
of
appeals
level.
nevertheless,
the
court
did
not
take
the
position
that
automatically,
because
the
fugitive
had
left
during
the
appeal
pending,
that
the
court
was
divested
of
jurisdiction
in
some
fashion.
rather,
the
court
looked
at
the
individual
case,
and
made
a
determination
whether
or
not
in
this
court's
powers,
it
ought
to
decline
to
hear
the
appeal.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
did
not
mean
to
lump
those
two
things
together.
what
i
was
merely
trying
to
illustrate...
inarticulately
though
it
may
have
been...
was
that
this
court
even
when
the
court
declined
to
hear
an
appeal,
it
did
not
set
down
an
automatic
rule.
rather,
it...
it
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
it
had
the
authority
not
to
hear
the
appeal,
but
did
not
say
that
it
was
divested
somehow
of
jurisdiction
because
the
appeal...
because
the
petitioner
was
a
fugitive.
in
addition,
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--possibly,
although
obviously,
as
your
honor
points
out,
the
longer
and
more
protracted
the
period
of
fugitivity,
the
more
likely
it
will
be
that
the
very
nature
of
the
fugitivity
during
the
appellate
process
has
some
way
compromised
the
appellate
court's
ability
to
deal
with
the
appeal.
however,
it
is
still
in
the
court's...
it
is
still
a
discretionary,
rather
than
a
mandatory,
reflexive
application
of
a
rule.
because
in
this
particular
case,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
that
because
the
issue
is
strictly
and
solely
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
and
because
the
record
has
already
been
prepared
and
the
briefs
are
already
filed,
that
even
a
period
of
fugitivity
for
3
years
might
not
necessarily
result
in
an
automatic
dismissal.
at
that
point,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
third
issue
that
courts
look
at...
vindication
of
the
court's
authority...
would
largely
come
into
play.
and
this
court
has
consistently...
or
at
least
consistently
when
the
petitioner
was
the...
the
criminal
defendant...
has
consistently
denied
that
kind
of
relief.
in
this
case,
the
appeal...
the
record
has
been
prepared,
the
brief
has
been
filed.
the
only
issue
in
the
case
is
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
and,
moreover,
the
merits
of
the
appeal
are
not
just
abstract.
rather,
a
similarly
situated
codefendant
has
had
his
conviction
reversed
because
of
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence.
the
defendant
in
this
case
received
a
15-year
sentence
on
the
same
case
for
which
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
similarly
situated
codefendant
reversed
the
conviction.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
that
is
one
of
the
factors,
your
honor,
that
has
been
considered
in
the
past
in
evaluating
whether
or
not
a
court
ought
to
dismiss
an
appeal.
that
is
one
of
the
factors.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
well,
it
very
well
may
be
in
many
cases.
however,
there
are
some
cases,
for
example,
where
there
may
be
plain
error.
or,
there
may
be
misconduct
on
the
part
of
the
government
in
final
argument.
or,
the
court
may
not
have
given
an
instruction
that
the
appellate
court
believes
ought
to
have
been
given.
and
because
of
the
significance
of
the
particular
instruction,
may
choose
to
go
forward
with
the
appeal.
so
the
essence
of
what
the
petitioner
has
been
saying
all
along
is
that
it
is
a
discretionary
call
on
the
part
of
the
court,
and
not
a
woodenly
applied,
automatic--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--some
appellate
courts
have,
in
fact,
done
that.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
the
second
factor--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--it's
a
discretionary
analysis,
your
honor.
and
the
court
is...
is...
in--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--i
am
going
beyond
that,
only
because
of
the
nature
of...
of
the...
the
merits
on
appeal
is
one
of
the
factors
that
has
been
looked
at.
although,
quite
practically
speaking,
i
have
lumped
that
into
factor
number
two,
which
focuses
on
the
potential--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
well,
in
a
case
where
the
case
has
merit,
but
the
period
of
fugitivity
has
been
protract...
a
protracted
period
of
time,
it
may
be
impossible
or
impractical
for
the
government
to
reprosecute.
so
in
that
case,
rather
than
militating
in
favor
of
hearing
the
appeal,
the
court...
within
its
supervisory
powers...
might
choose
not
to
hear
the
appeal,
in
applying
its
discretion.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
the
greater
the
chances
of
success
on
the
appeal--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--the
greater
the
likelihood.
i...
it's
difficult
for
me
to
quantify
exactly
how
those
factors
will
play
out.
because
the
court's
question
seemingly
would
involve
almost
any
analysis
in
almost
any
case.
and
obviously,
it's
going
to
depend
upon
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
an
individual
case,
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
wants
to
use
its
discretion
in
refusing
to
hear
an
appeal.
in
this...
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia,
did
you
have--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--i
was
moving
on
to
another
point.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
okay.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
i
believe
that
in
a
case
where
the
court
exercises
its
discretion
not
to
hear
an
appeal,
that
that
is
always
subject
to
an
abuse-of-discretion
analysis.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
the
general
rules
that
exist
are
that
the
right
to
appeal
is
fundamental,
especially
in
a
criminal
case.
the
other
proposition
is
that
in
spite
of
the
right
to
appeal,
which
is
a
congressionally
conferred
right,
that
the
court,
in
an
exercise
of
its
inherent
powers,
can
limit
the
right
to
appeal
in
certain
classes
of
cases
where
there
has
been
some
fugitivity.
it
is
impossible
to
set
down
a
brightline
rule
to
say
that
if
a
defendant
is
gone
more
than
x-number
of
days
or
months,
that
there
is
going
to
be
some
sort
of
prejudice
presumed.
because
in
some
cases,
a
period
of
fugitivity
of
less
than
that
might
well
militate
against
going
forward
with
the
appeal.
if,
for
example,
witnesses
have
died,
or
their
memories
have
dimmed...
or
things
of
that
sort...
and
the
relief
being
sought
would
require
a
retrial...
in
those
cases,
the
court,
within
its
supervisory
powers,
might
well
determine
not
to
go
forward
with
the
appeal.
nevertheless,
there's
a
whole
other
class
of
cases
where
a
period
of
fugitivity
might
be
even
longer,
where
there
is
no
good
reason
for
the
court
to
exercise
its
discretion
and
limit
its
jurisdiction
in
that
way.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
that's...
well,
that's
correct,
not
to
hear
the
appeal.
in
this
case,
with
reference
to
the
second
prong
about
appellate
post...
potential
postappellate
proceedings,
the
only
issue
is
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
there
will
be
no
retrial.
there
will
not
be
any
prejudice
to
the
government
which
might
be
attendant
to
a
reprosecution
after
a
period
of
time.
the
third
prong
is
the
vindication
of
the
court's
authority.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
that's
correct.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
well,
it
has
been
decided--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--as
to
a
codefendant
that
is
similarly
situated.
that's
correct.
the
third
prong
is...
is...
that
other
courts
have
looked
at,
is
the
vindication
of
the
court's
authority.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
has
been
prosecuted
by
the
government,
convicted,
and
sentenced
by
the
district
court
for
violations
of
contempt
of
court,
as
well
as
bond
reform
act
violations.
he
has
been
sentenced
to
a
period
of
21
years...
or
21
months'
incarceration
for
committing
that
violation.
consequently,
the
authority
of
the
district
court
has
been
vindicated
by
the
petitioner's
period
of
fugitivity.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
not
necessarily
in
every
case,
but
certainly
in
a
case
where
the
period
of
fugitivity
begins
before
the
appellate
process
starts
off,
and
he
has
not
been
a
fugitive,
and
has
been
available
to
accept
the
consequences
of
an
adverse
ruling
at
the
court
of
appeals.
in
those
cases--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--he
was...
he
was
arrested.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
that's
correct.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
he
doesn't
get
credit
for
that.
he
gets
punished
for
that,
as
he
has
been,
by
prosecution
and
conviction
for
those
two
statutes.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
it's
not
a
matter
of
favorable
treatment,
your
honor.
what
it
is
a
matter
of
is
participating
in
his
rights
to
appeal
when
there
is
no
reason
not
to
have
the
appeal
go
forward.
again,
the
decisions
regarding
the
parameters
of
the
appellate
process
are
defined
by
congress.
if
congress
had
chosen...
as
they
did
in
the...
in
enacting
the
bond
reform
act...
they
mentioned
contempt
of
court,
as
well
as
violation
of
3146
directly.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
that's
correct.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
not
at
all.
because
within
the
rulemaking
authority
of
the
courts,
timetables
and
time
limits
can
be
established
in
order
to
regulate
the
appeals
in
the
litigation
before
the
court.
that
is
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
exactly
right,
your
honor.
however,
the
rulemaking
authority
cannot
be
in
conflict
with
the
constitution
or
with
statutory
rights,
and
can
neither
enlarge
or
abridge
any
rights
that
are
thus
conferred.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
we
did
not
make
a
constitutional
claim.
i'm
trying
to
draw
the
distinction
between
the
rulemaking
authority
of
the
court
in
a
matter
of
regulating
the
appellate
practice
before
it,
and
deciding
to
have
a
blanket
rule
which
exercises
nonjurisdiction
in
cases
where
there
has
been
a
period
of
fugitivity.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
would
be.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
i
do
believe,
your
honor,
that
that
third
prong
is
one
of
lesser
significance
than
the
first
two...
primarily
because
congress
has
spoken
in
the
contempt
statute,
as
well
as
the
bond
reform
act
statute,
in
this
whole
area
of
vindication
of
the
court's
authority.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
focusing
just
on
the
third
prong?
mr.
james
robert
gailey
i
suppose
that
if
the
period
of
fugitivity
directly
occurred
while
the
appeal
was
pending...
as
this
court
has
been
faced
with
on
several
occasions...
there,
i
believe
that
as
a
response
to
that
the
court
would
be
within
its
rights
to
dismiss
the
appeal.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
because
the
court
has
the
right
to
regulate
the
matters
that
are
before
it.
and
in
the
hypothec
that
your
honor
poses--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--it
would
directly
affect
this
court
or
the
appellate
court's
function.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--the
reasons
why
were
set
forth
in
the
whole
line
of
cases
beginning
with
smith,
over
100
years
ago...
or
nearly
100
years
ago.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
it's
not
a
direct-contempt
analysis.
rather,
it
is
an
inherent-power
analysis,
where
this
court
has
the
right
to
regulate
the
matters
that
are
before
it.
and
in
the
case
where
an
appeal
is
pending
before
it,
and
this
court
recognizes
that
because
the
defendant
is
gone,
he
or
she
is
not
available
to
accept
the
consequences
of
an
adverse
judgment,
this
court...
in
a
vindication
of
its
authority...
can
dismiss
the
appeal.
however,
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
any
case
which
holds,
by
either
the
court
of
appeals
or
this
court,
that
automatically
if
there
is
a
period
of
fugitivity
at
the
district
court
level
that
the
supreme
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
can
just
dismiss
the
appeal.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
not
at
all.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
first
of
all,
those
rules
that
the
court
suggest
are
ones
that
are
the
product
of...
of
thoughtful
analysis
and
discretion
and
are
the
end
result
of...
at
least
according
to
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure
in
an
appellate
court
context...
a
majority
vote
by
the
court
of
appeals
judges.
with
reference
to
the
appellate
rules,
themselves,
or
the
criminal
rules
of
procedure,
this
court
and
the
congress...
congress
then
adopts,
in
statutory
form,
those
rules.
they
are
there
as
expressions
of
the
court's
power
to
regulate
the
matters
before
it.
this
case,
there
is
nothing
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
not
at
all.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
of
course.
but--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--precisely.
except
when
that
power
is
exercised,
it's
got
to
be...
it
cannot
be
in
noncompliance
with
either
statutory
right
or
congressional
right.
and
in
this
court...
this
court
looked
at
a
similar
rule
in
the
thomas
v.
arn
case
where
you
had
an
expression
by
congress
of
a
limitation
of
the
right
to
appeal
from
magistrates'
orders.
the
court
went
to
great
lengths
to
ascertain
and
to
conclude
that
it
was
not
an
arbitrary
rule;
that
it
was
not
a
jurisdiction
rule.
and
one
of
the
things
they
looked
at
was
the
fact
that
in
a
recent
case,
the
court
had
declined
to
treat
it
as
a
waiver.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
no...
i'm
sorry
if
i've...
i've
misled
the
court
if
that's
the
conclusion
that
you
have.
it's
not
that
if
it's
a
rule
that
it's
bad.
but
rather,
when
an
appellate
court
attempts
to
use
its
discretion
not
to
hear
an
appeal
for
which
jurisdiction
is
conferred
by
congress,
that
there...
it
needs
to
be
done
in
conformity
with
its
supervisory
powers.
and
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
no
reason
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
to
have
denied
the
petitioner
the
right
to
have
his
case
on
appeal.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
he
was
gone
for
11
months,
your
honor.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
that's
correct.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
except
the
court
didn't
so
conclude.
rather,
the
argument
made
below
was
that
just
by
virtue
of
the
fugitive
status,
he
was
precluded
from
an
appeal.
so
there
was
not
any
sort
of
analysis
at
all
done
about
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals,
in
its
discretion,
ought
not
to
go
forward
with
the
appeal.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
they
merely...
they
granted
the
government's
motion
to
dismiss.
and
the
argument
on
that
motion
was
based
on
preclusion,
not
based
on
any
discretionary
analysis.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
the
trial
court
was
convinced
that--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--the
trial
court
did
not
have
to
resentence
him.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
if
not,
then
the
appeal
time
would
have
been
run...
had
run,
and
he
would
have
been
out.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
based
upon
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
not
present
and
could
not
allocute
on
his
own
behalf,
the
district
court
was
satisfied
that
the
sentencing
ought
to
be
vacated
and
resentenced.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
the
authority...
there
is
a...
a
case
in
the
eleventh
circuit
which
allows
the
court,
in
its
supervisory
powers,
to
do
that.
so
the
district
court
judge
did
do
that--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--that's
not
the
rule.
rather,
the
court
made
the
determination...
the
district
court
judge
made
the
determination.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
when--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--i'm
sorry.
when
the
court
is
satisfied
that
in
the
particular
case,
the
sentencing
ought
to
be
reopened.
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
district
court
judge
did
express
that--
mr.
james
robert
gailey
--the
district
court
judge
had
the
discretion,
and
still
had
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
the
argument
made
below
was...
dealt
with
his
presence
at
the
sentencing,
as
well
as
whether
or
not
the
court
ought
to
have
sentenced
him
in
absentia,
since
there
was
a
question
about
whether
notice
had
been
given.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
that's
correct.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
that's
correct.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
normally
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
james
robert
gailey
normally
that
would
be
true.
thank
you,
your
honor.
