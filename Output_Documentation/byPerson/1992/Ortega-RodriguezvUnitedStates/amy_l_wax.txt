ms.
amy

wax
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
starts
out
his
argument
by
saying
that
the
government
concedes
that
fugitivity
does
not
automatically
lead
to
forfeiture
of
an
appeal.
that
is
a
highly
misleading
statement.
it's
true.
we
agree
that
the
mere
fact
that
someone
is
fugitive
does
not
require
any
court
of
appeals
to
dismiss
his
court
of
appeals
to
dismiss
his
appeal
because
there
is
no
requirement
that
any
court
of
appeals
adopt
the
disentitlement
doctrine,
or
extend
the
rule
of
dismissal
for
fugitivity
to
preappeal
flight.
in--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--it's
a
bit
mysterious,
justice
o'connor.
but
as
we
understand
it...
we
understand
the
district
court
to
have,
in
effect,
granted
a
2255
motion.
or,
that's
how
we
think--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--the
petitioner's
motion
was
styled.
a
motion
for
a
correction
of
sentence,
because
the
sentence
was
illegally
imposed.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
he
got
a
shorter
sentence,
your
honor.
when
he
filed
his
motion,
after
returning...
after
being
recaptured,
he
filed
a
motion
with
the
district
court,
citing
rule
43
and
rule
32:
rule
43,
which
has
to
do
with
proceedings
in
absentia;
and
rule
32
which
governs
sentencing,
you
know,
procedures
at
sentencing...
the
right
of
allocution,
the
right
to
be
informed
of
your
right
to
appeal,
et
cetera.
and
as
we
understand
it--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
let's
put
it...
i'm
not
sure,
is
the
answer.
the
government
did
not--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--object.
no,
it
did
not.
the
government
did
not
challenge
the
authority
of
the
court
to
reopen
the
sentence.
we
did
object
to
the
reduction
of
sentence.
it
can
be
argued...
we
don't
think
that
the
defect
is
jurisdictional.
it
can
be
argued
that
the
district
court
shouldn't
have
resentenced
him,
because
number
one,
he
never
took
a
direct
appeal
on
the
sentencing
in
absentia.
but
then
you
can
argue
that
you
shouldn't
hold
the
defendant
to
the
obligation
to
take
a
direct
appeal
if
he's
not
there.
on
the
other
hand,
you
could
argue
that
this
isn't
the
kind
of
error
that
can
be
entertained
on
a
2255...
there
are
lots
of
possible
objections
that
you
could
make.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
judge
did
resentence
him.
we
didn't
object
to
it.
and
as
we
understood
it,
the
court
of
appeals
took
that
as
a
final
judgment...
as
the
sentence
that
triggered
his
appeal
and
his
appeal
of
his--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--underlying
claim,
yeah.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
took
the
second
sentence
as
the
final--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--sentence.
i
don't...
judge
king.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yeah.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
if
we
were
to
consider
this...
and
once
again,
we're
not
sure
what
it
really
is,
what
animal
it
is.
but
if
it
was
a
2255
in
the
sense...
i
think
that
we
would
take
the
position
that
yes...
because
this
was
treated
as
the
sentence
in
this
case,
the
final
judgment--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--okay,
if
you're
asking
what
our
position
is
about
dismissal
of
appeals
from
collateral
attack...
that's
what
you're
asking?
ms.
amy
l.
wax
from
collateral
attacks...
the
government's
position
would
be...
well,
first
of
all,
the
question
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
has
a
rule
in
this
case
that
we're
willing
to
defend,
of
dismissal
of
appeals
in
these...
in
those
situations.
and
i
think
our
position
would
be
that
if
it's
a
true
collateral
attack,
that
the
fugitivity
and
the
failure
to
take
an
appeal
should
be
treated
as
an
ordinary
default,
procedural
default,
and
that
the
procedural
default
rules
should
apply
in
those
cases.
but
once
again,
it's
not
really
our
choice
to
make
these
rules.
the
question
is,
you
know,
what
are
the
rules
that
the
courts
can
make
that
are
reasonable;
that
are
within
their
supervisory
powers?
i
mean
we're
not
standing
here
commending
to
the
court
one
particular
rule,
as
opposed
to
another.
because
that's
not
the
posture
of
this
case.
the
posture
of
this
case
is--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--your
honor,
we
disagree
with
that.
he
can't
make
a
showing
of
actual
innocence.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
there
is
an
enormous
difference
between
actual
innocence...
the
type
that
excuses
procedural
default...
and
falling
short
of
proving
something
beyond
a--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--reasonable
doubt.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
we
understand
the
actual
innocence
exception,
you
know,
for
collateral
attack,
to
mean
there
has
to
be
affirmative
proof
that
you
didn't
do
it.
and
it
has
to
be
tied
to
a
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
that's
the
government's
position
on
the
actual
innocence
exception.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
i
think
the
court...
a
court
could
have
a
rule
which
would
allow
it
to
dismiss
an
appeal
under
those
circumstances.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
the
government's
position
is
that
courts
of
appeals
may
proceed
to
make...
using
their
supervisory
authority,
to
make
blanket,
across-the-board-type
rules
which
do
not
have
to
proceed
case
by
case,
and
would
encompass
that
type
of--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--situation--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
i
mean
that--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--if
it
is
pursuant
to
a
general
rule
that
has
a
rational
justification
that
is
reasonable
in
terms
of
the
problem
it's
designed
to
address.
there
are
three
criteria
for
a--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--valid,
supervisory--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
i
think
in
terms
of
committing
probation
violations,
there...
you
know,
it
would
depend...
and,
you
know,
i'm
not
a
master
of
probation
violation
law...
but
i
think
it
would
depend
on
whether...
ah...
you
know,
that
exercise
of
supervisory
authority
conflicted
with
a
rule
of
this
court,
or
a
statute,
or
some
body
of
law
that
this
court
has
developed
to
govern
the
particular
area.
and
if
the--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--answer
was
no--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
if
the
answer
was
no,
then,
then
it
would
be
permissible.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
but
let
me
make
a
point
about
that--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
the
answer
is
yes.
but
let
me
make
a
point
about
that.
any
time
this
court
decides
that
it
doesn't
like
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
are
exercising
their
supervisory
authority
under
rule
47,
it
doesn't
have
to
make
a
finding
of
unreasonableness,
of
conflict
with
a
statute
or
a
rule,
or
of
a
constitution
before
it
can
act
to
impose
a
uniform,
national
rule
on
the
courts
of
appeals.
and
the
fact
is,
if
the
court
validates,
or
permits
the
eleventh
circuit
dismissal
rule
to
stand,
it's
not
really
committing
itself
to
any...
to
the
next
extension
of
that
rule
in
the
next
case.
because--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
to
the
extent
that
dismissal--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
no,
it's
tied
into
the
sorts
of
interests
that
this
court
has
recognized
as
valid,
that
the
courts
can
vindicate
through
supervisory
rules
with
regard
to...
you
know...
fugitivity.
i
mean...
we...
you
can't
dismiss
for
a
parole
violation...
if
you
can't
dismiss,
it's
because
there's
really
no
good
reason...
there's
nothing
that
the
court
is
accomplishing
by
doing
that
this
court
is
willing
to
accept.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
but
in
fugitivity--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--but
that's--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--but
that's
to
assume
that
courts
have
to
proceed
case
by
case,
that
they
have
to
look
at
the
circumstances
of
each
case.
but
there's
nothing
that
this
court
has
ever
said
about
supervisory
rules
that
would
require
a
court
to
do
that.
courts--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--of
course
not.
it
has
to
be...
it
has
to
have,
as
a
general
matter,
some
effect
on
the
appellate
process.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
has
to
involve
a
flouting
of
the
appellate
process.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
i
mean
i
think
the
answer
is
it
doesn't
have
a
similar
effect
to
fleeing
the
court.
and
in
that
sense,
it's
possible
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
valid
exercise
of
supervisory
authority.
but
my
point
is,
that
whether
or
not
it
were
valid,
and
there
were
a
good
reason
to
dismiss
because
of
this,
you
could
have
a
blanket
rule.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right,
to
the--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right,
to
the
orderly
functioning
of
the
court
process.
the
way--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--this
court
has
put
it--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
it
depends
on
how
much
weight
one
puts
on
this
court's
statement
in
its
line
of
cases
that
flouting
the
authority
of
the
court
is
an
independent
reason
to
dismiss.
i
think
prob...
you
know,
one
could
argue
that
that
wouldn't
rise
to
the
level
of
a
sufficient
flouting
of
the
court's
authority.
i
think
that...
i
think
that
you
could
make
a
distinction
between
that
case
and
true
fugitivity.
because
in
true
fugitivity,
someone
just
removes
themselves
from
the
court's
authority...
succeeds
in
removing
themselves,
and
thereby,
in
effect,
displays
their
unwillingness
to
submit
to
the
court's
jurisdiction
or
control.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
do
think
that
it
can
take
into
account
possible...
the
possibility
of
prejudice
both
to
the
appellate
court
and
the
trial
court.
our
submission
is
this:
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--not
in
every
case,
your
honor.
we
think
that
there--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
yes--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--we
think
that
it's
just
a
garden
variety
principle
of
rulemaking.
and
this
court
has
said
it,
in
cases
like
weinberger
v.
salfi,
and
arizona
v.
maricopa
county,
that
it's
not
necessary
to
minutely
examine
the
facts
of
each
and
every
instance
to
which
a
rule
applies
to
see
whether
it
exemplifies
the
concerns
that
motivated
the
rule
in
order
to
have
a
valid
rule.
rules
can
be
based
upon
generalizations...
generalizations
that
certain
actions
on
the
part
of
individuals,
actions
which
they
can
choose
not
to
take,
will
tend
to,
in
many
cases,
have
certain
adverse
effects
that
the
court
is
entitled
protect
against.
and--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--correct,
your
honor.
and
our
position
in
this
case
is
even
if
the
court
decides
that
one
has
to
proceed
case
by
case
with
fugitive
dismissal
rules
and
there
has
to
be
a
showing
of
prejudice,
there
was
prejudice
in
this
case.
and
there
was
certainly
enough
to
justify
dismissal.
petitioner
was
gone
for
11
months.
and
his
appeal
was
delayed
by
more
than
that
because
there
were
posttrial
motions.
he...
in
this
case,
there
were
codefendants
with
closely
related
claims.
and
because
of
his
fugitivity,
the
court
had
to
take
up
the
closely
related
claims
of
his
codefendants
separately,
and
at
a
different
time...
or
would
have
had
to...
than
his
case.
and
we
think
that
that's
enough
dislocation
and
disruption
of
the
appellate
process
to
justify
dismissal.
especially
considering
what
the
court
has
said
in
cases
like
estelle
v.
dorrough,
where
they've
said
that...
for
example...
a
state
may
adopt
a
fugitive
dismissal
rule
just
based
on
creating
a
deterrent
to
flight,
number
one;
and
number
two,
vindicating
the
orderly
and
dignified
process
of
the
appellate
court.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
it's
hard
to
know
because
the
court
simply
dismissed
the
appeal.
and
so,
you
know,
it's...
it's
difficult
to
say
that
they--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes,
there
were
two
prior
cases
that
were
relied
on
by
the
government
here:
united
states
v.
holmes,
and
united
states
v.
london...
two
eleventh--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--circuit
cases.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
ah--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
if
you
read
those
cases
carefully,
the
government
thinks
that,
in
effect,
those
cases
look
both
ways.
on
the
one
hand,
there
are
statements
in
holmes
to
the
effect
that
because
this
individual
fled,
fled
custody,
we
are
going
to
dismiss
the
case...
which
have
a
categorical
tone
to
them,
and
imply
that
this
is
a
blanket
rule.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
on
the
other
hand--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--no,
that
was
a
case
like
this
one
in
which
the
individual
fled
following
conviction,
returned
to
be
sentenced,
and
then
filed
an
appeal.
that
was
a
preappeal
flight
case.
um...
so
the
court--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes...
well,
that's
the
whole
point
of
these
cases,
as
you
pointed
out
earlier,
justice
white.
individuals
can
hang
up
these
cases
in
the
district
court,
just
by
choosing
to
flee
prior
to
sentencing.
not
showing
up
at
their
sentencing,
they
can
keep
the
case
pending
before
the
court
of
appeals,
prevent
it
from
going...
before
the
district
court,
and
prevent
it
from
going
before
the
court
of
appeals.
and
essentially,
what
petitioner
is
saying
is
that
these
people
should
be
treated
differently
from
people
who
choose
to
come
to
their
sentencing,
thereby
triggering
the
obligation
to
file
a
timely
appeal
which
then
either
they
will
not
timely
file
because
they're
fugitive,
or
will
be
dismissed
under
the
pending
fugitive
dismissal
rule
this
court
accepts.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
no,
i...
i
don't
recall
exactly
how
the
long
the
petitioner
was
gone
in
holmes.
but
it
was
a--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--fairly
long
period.
yeah,
it
was
years.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
i
think
the
answer
is:
quite
possibly.
the
fifth
circuit
has
recognized
its
authority
to
not
allow
an
appeal...
even
from
a
sentencing...
where
someone
is
sentenced
after
they've
returned.
in
the
case
in
which
it
recognized
that,
it
refused
to
exercise
that
authority.
that
was
a
case
called
united
states
v.
devalle.
every
other
circuit
that
i
know
of
has
distinguished
between
events
taking
place
before
the
person
fled...
that
is,
during
trial...
and
what
happens
after
they
come
back.
and
they've
just
elected
to
extend
the
dismissal
rule
only
to
events
preflight,
as
is
their
prerogative.
that's
just
a
choice
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
made
in
fashioning
a
fugitive
dismissal
rule.
could
they
take
it
one
step
further?
i
think
that
unless
it
violates
a
rule
or
the
constitution,
and
they
think
that
there
are
good
reasons
to
do
that,
probably
it
would
be
permissible...
that
a
person
forfeits
not
just
their
right
to
take
an
appeal
as
to
prior
events,
but
their
right
to
take
an
appeal
as
to
a
sentence.
but
it
just
hasn't
been
applied
that
way.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
it's
not
insignifi...
well,
let
me
answer
your
question
first.
it's
not
insignificant,
your
honor,
in
the
following
sense:
the
first
circuit
has
ruled
that
they
are
absolutely...
they
have
no
authority
to
dismiss
where
the
flight
is
preappeal...
the
person
flees
and
comes
back
before
they're
sentenced.
so
you
at
least
took
this
case
to
dispel
the...
in
our
opinion...
erroneous
view
that
no
court
of
appeals
has
the
authority--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--to
dismiss
a
case
under
those
circumstances--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--whether
they
go
case
by
case--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--or
as
a
mandatory
rule.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
can
at
least
accomplish
that
much,
justice
scalia.
now,
as
i
stated,
a
supervisory...
a
rule
formulated
by
a
court
of
appeals
in
its
supervisory
capacity
is
valid,
as
long
as
that
rule
does
not
conflict
with
the
constitution,
a
statute,
or
rules
of
procedure,
is
one
that
can
properly
be
established
through
adjudication,
and
is
reasonable
in
light
of
the
concerns
it
is
designed
to
address.
and
i
would
just...
as
a
respect
to
the
authority
to
establish
these
rules
through
adjudication,
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
that
that
authority
is
expressly
conferred
by
the
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
47,
which
says
that
in
all
cases
not
provided
for
by
formal
rules
promulgated
by
a
vote
of
the
circuit
justices,
the
court
of
appeals
may
regulate
their
practice
in
any
manner
not
inconsistent
with
the
federal
rules
of
procedure.
and
this
brings
up
another
point
that
petitioner
made
in
his
argument,
which
i
would
like
to
deal
with.
he
makes
the
argument
that
if
a
rule
is
mandatory...
if
a
rule
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
exercise
of
its
supervisory
power
is
a
general
rule,
a
blanket
rule
to
which
it
decides
to
make
no
exceptions,
that
means
that
the
court
is
somehow
abridging
its
jurisdiction.
and
we
would
submit
that
that
is
absolute
nonsense.
because
the
consequence
of
that
argument
would
be
that
every
time
a
court...
through
formulating
local
rules,
or
this
court
through
formulating
rules
of
appellate
procedure...
makes
a
general
rule,
it's
somehow
amending
section
1291,
which
is
clearly
untrue.
a
court
may
choose
to
exercise
its
dismissal
authority
in
every
case.
but
in
a
further
case,
it
could
always
change
its
mind
because
it
still
retains
jurisdiction
over
those
particular
types
of
cases.
and,
of
course,
in
molinaro
v.
new
jersey,
this
court
recognized
that
for
fugitive
dismissal
rules,
the
fact
that
an
individual
is
fugitive,
does
not
strip
the
case
of
its
character
as
an
adjudicable
case
or
controversy.
so
the
issue
of
lacking
jurisdiction
is
just...
it's
a
straw
man
in
this
case.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
they've
occurred
in
every
circuit.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i
can
tell
you...
at
least
12
times,
your
honor.
[laughter]
ms.
amy
l.
wax
twice,
in
some.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
yes,
and
they
have
occurred...
there
have
been
four
or
five
cases
in
this
court...
or
more...
involving
this
problem.
now
finally,
the
most
important
point
in
this
case
is
that
the
rule
applied
in
this
case...
the
rule
of
preappeal
fugitive
dismissal...
is
reasonable
in
light
of
the
concerns
that
the
court
sought
to
address.
there
have
been
a
number
of
justifications
offered
for
the
dismissal
of
fugitive
appeals,
and
in
the
cases
in
which
the
courts
have
dismissed
pending
appeals.
and
this
court,
itself,
has
validated
that
rule
of
the
dismissal
of
pending
appeals.
and
most
of
the
justifications
offered
in
those
cases
apply
with
equal
force
to
cases
in
which
the
individual
flees
and
returns
prior
to
sentencing
and
filing
his
appeal.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
he
was
there,
your
honor.
he
was
at
the
resentencing.
and
he
opposed
it.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yeah,
he
was
there.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right,
he
opposed
it.
but
it's
our...
he
opposed
the
reduction
of
sentence,
your
honor...
the
reduction--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--from
235
months--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--to
188--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--months.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
he
was
there.
there
is
a
transcript.
i
believe
it's
in
the
joint
appendix,
yes.
the
reasons
that
the
court...
this
court
and
other
courts
have
given,
as
i
said,
apply
with
equal
force
to
preappeal
and
postappeal
flight.
and
briefly,
those
reasons
are:
number
one,
the
flouting,
the
defiance,
and
the
contempt
for
the
court
that's
shown
by
someone
who
absconds.
and,
of
course,
that's
equally
grave,
whether
the
person
goes
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal
or
before
he's
sentenced
and
fails
to
show
up
at
sentencing.
the
second
reason
is
to
deter
flight...
to
provide
a
disincentive
for
flight.
and
once
again,
if
we
have
a
rule
that
during
a
pending
appeal
if
someone
flees
his
case
is
dismissed,
but
if
someone
flees
before
his
appeal
is
filed
it
won't
be
dismissed,
that
will
simply
offer
an
incentive
to
people...
for
people
to
flee
sooner,
rather
than
later.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
i...
i
think
the
point,
your
honor,
is
is
that
if
someone
removes
himself
from
the
reach
of
the
court,
it's
not
just
a
matter
of,
you
know,
thumbing
your
nose--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--at
the
court.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i
don't
think
that's
what's
meant
by--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--flouting.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
i
think--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--i
think
this
would
come
under
a
speech
act,
rather
than
speech,
your
honor.
i--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--this
would
be
o'brien.
the
o'brien
test
would
definitely
apply
here.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i
don't...
your
honor,
i
would
say
no,
because
i
think
what
we
mean
by
flouting
and
contempt
for
the
court
is
to
remove
yourself
from
the
court's
process...
not
just
thumbing
your
nose--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--showing
your
contempt--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--for
the
judges
and
that
sort
of
thing.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
you
might
be
able
to
do
that...
well,
i'm
not
sure--
[laughter]
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--after
this
court's--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--cases.
[laughter]
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i
think
under
this
court's
most
recent
flag-burning
cases,
probably
not.
as
i
said,
the
second
reason
is
to
deter
flight.
and
the
deterrent
operates
equally
in
both
the
situations.
and
finally,
dismissal
promotes
the
orderly
and
efficient
operation
of
the
courts
and
protects
against
adverse
effects
on
the
prosecutor
and
on
the
court.
and
those
adverse
affects
can
be
felt...
not
necessarily
in
every
case,
but
potentially
in
as
many
cases,
and
as
severely...
whether
flight
is
preappeal
or
during
the
pendency
of
the
appeal.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
