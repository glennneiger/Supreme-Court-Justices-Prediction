is
it
a
flat
rule
that
someone
who
absconds
while
his
appeal
is
pending
has...
deserves
to
have
his
appeal
dismissed?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a
pretty
flat
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't...
that
is
nothing
case
to
case
about
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
thought
there
was...
apparently
we
thought
there
was
a
class
of
cases
where
the...
where
you
could
dispense
with
case-by-case
analysis,
because
you
would
always
come
out
the
same
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
for
a
class
of
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
a
class
of
cases,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
was
that
just
for
the...
was
that
just
for
the
case
that
we
had
before
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
there's
no...
there's
no...
there's
no
good
reason
for
it
deciding
not
to
hear
the
appeal.
not
it
isn't
limiting
its
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
you
say
has
already
been
decided.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
another
party's
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
wouldn't
think
there
would
be
many
cases
like
this,
where
you
can
be
gone
for
11
months
and
still
have
a
right
to
appeal.
i
suppose
if...
if
you
take
off...
if
the
defendant
takes
off
and
stays
away
longer
than
his
appeal
time,
why
normally
he
just
can't
take
an
appeal.
and
you
don't
object
to
that.
you
say
that
courts
of
appeals
can
set
times
at
which
appeals
have
to
be
taken.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
certainly
congress
can
do
that
by
statute.
so--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
you're
gone
longer...
if
you
run
off
and
stay
longer
than
your
appeal
time
allows,
you're
out,
normally.
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
you
can
convince
some
district
judge
to
do
what
happened
here.
