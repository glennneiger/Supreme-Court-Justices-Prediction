we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-7749,
jose
antonio
ortega-rodriguez
v.
united
states.
mr.
gailey,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well...
mr.
gailey...
let
me
find
out
about
what
you
and
the
government...
you
say...
agree
to
here.
you...
you
both
agree
that
the
right
to
appeal
may
be
forfeited
if
there
is
a
case-by-case
analysis,
so
to
speak?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
you
should
lump
together,
mr.
gailey,
the
cases
we've
had
from
state
courts
involving
this,
and
the
cases
from
federal
courts.
because
our
only
authority
over
state
courts
is
the
constitution.
whereas,
here
you're
relying...
at
least
in
part...
on
the
congressional
grant
of
the
right
of
appeal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
one
factor
that
must
be
considered
is
the
likelihood
of
success
on
appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ah...
that
really
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
sense,
does
it?
i
mean
if
you're
going
to
dismiss
an
appeal,
you're
saying
you're
not
entitled
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
on
the
merits
of
your
case
because
you
have,
in
some
way,
defaulted
or
waived.
and
so
to
take
into
account
whether
or
not
you
would
have
had
much
of
a
go
at
it,
had
you
not
defaulted,
it
seems
inconsistent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
an
appellate
court
can
say
we'd...
under
our
other
factors
we'd
hold
you
had
defaulted.
but
this
is
a
kind
of
a
case
we've
been
looking
for
for
a
long
time
to
decide
on
the
merits.
so
we're
going
to
do
it.
that
would
be
permissible?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
the
only
issue
is
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
you
mean
that
no...
no
question
is
being-raised
on
appeal
about
improper
evidence
admitted,
or
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
just
strictly
one
question:
was
there
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
finding
of
guilt?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
could
always
say
that.
you
know...
if
someone
coming
back
after
20
years...
if
they
get
a
sentence
for
absconding
as
well.
that's
correct.
but
again,
that
is
only
one
of
the
factors
that
courts
have
looked
at,
and
only
one
of
the
factors
that
we
believe
are
appropriate
for
inquiry.
but
you
say
that
factor
is
satisfied
by
the
appealing
defendant
in
every
case
where
he
is
sentenced
for
his
offense
of
bail
jumping...
or
whatever
it
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
the
only
real...
that
really
is
fortuitous
in
this
case.
it's
not
as
if
your
client
returned
voluntarily.
he
was
caught.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
he
gets
credit
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he,
nonetheless,
gets
favorable
treatment
because
he
was
back...
albeit
not
of
his
own
will.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
dismissing
an
appeal
for
failure
to
file
a
timely
notice?
congress
hasn't
provided
the...
the
rules
provide
the
notice,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
violation
of
congress'
conferring
of
a
right
to
appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
that
is
an
example
of
a
rule
that
certainly
impinges
on
an
unlimited
right
to
take
advantage
of
the
congressional
right.
and
what
the
government
is
saying
is
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
rulemaking
authority
in
this
area,
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn't
understand
you
to
make
any
constitutional
claim
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gailey.
ms.
wax,
we'll
hear
from
you.
