justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
that
in
this
case,
your
client
had
absconded
and
was
absent
for
3
years
during
which
time
an
appeal
had
been
pending
and
was
dismissed.
could
you
argue
that
the
dismissal
was
invalid
at
that
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
the
authority
of
the
district
court
to
reopen
the
sentence,
anyway?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what's
the
authority
of
the
district
court
to
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can
vacate
the
sentence
at
any
time
if
the
defendant
had
been
sentenced
in
absentia?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
what
the
eleventh
circuit's
authority
said.
in
what
circumstances
can
a
district
judge
reopen
a
sentencing
after
the
period
for
modification
has
run,
under
the
federal
rules--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
criminal
procedure?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
eleventh
circuit
says
that
any
time
a
district
court
judge
is
satisfied
sentencing
has
to...
may
be
reopened,
and
it
can
do
it,
despite
the
provisions
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure?
