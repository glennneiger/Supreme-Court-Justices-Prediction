well,
i
wonder
if--
--go
ahead.
yes,
i
wonder
if
that's
true.
because
his
flight
kept
this
case
alive
much
longer
than
it
otherwise
would
have
been
kept
alive.
he
was
gone
what,
3
years?
justice
john
paul
stevens
11
months...
well,
for
11
months,
because
he
wasn't
present
at
his
sentencing,
he
had
a
right
to
resentencing,
because
he
had
to
be
present.
isn't
that
what...
and
therefore,
they
resentenced.
but
that
was
all
because
of
his
flight,
that
it
postponed
for
11
months.
therefore
the
whole
appellate
process
is
11
months
behind
schedule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
was
at
least
a
reason
why
one
could
conclude
that
his
flight
had
an
adverse
impact
on
the
appellate
process.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
didn't
write...
they
didn't
really
write
an
opinion
explaining
what
they
did,
did
they?
i
can't
remember.
