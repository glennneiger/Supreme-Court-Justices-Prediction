justice
david
h.
souter
so--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
you
really
want
a...
a
kind
of
a
three-prong
test,
plus
anything
else
the
court
wants
to
bring
in.
because
this
doesn't
fit
in
your
three
prongs.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
all
i'm
saying
is...
i
thought
your
argument
began
by
saying
there's
a...
essentially
a
three-part
inquiry.
and
you're
going
beyond
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
on
prejudice
to
the
appellate
process?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
does
it
fit
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
greater
the
chances
of
success,
the
less
likelihood
of
being
given
relief?
justice
david
h.
souter
on
appeal.
justice
david
h.
souter
has--
--would
you
say
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
the
court's
discretion
in
a
case
in
which
there
had
not
been
a
prosecution
for
escape,
for
the
court
to
say
look,
i
don't
want
to
encourage
the
united
states
attorney
to
waste
more
court
time
on...
on...
on
escape
prosecutions.
and
i
will
simply
cut
off
the
right
to
appeal.
i
will
simply
find
the
right
to
appeal
waived,
and
that
will
teach
him
a
lesson.
in
that
case,
there
would
have
been
no
independent
vindication.
so
would
that
be
a
proper
use
of
the
court's
power
to
vindicate
its
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it
wouldn't
be,
then
isn't
the
answer...
isn't
it
going
to
be
the
case
that
in
every
case...
whether
a
person
has
been
prosecuted
for
escape
or
not...
he
could
be;
and
whether
bail
has
been
revoked
or
not,
it
could
be.
so
that
in
every
case,
your
third
prong,
in
fact,
is
going
to
result
in
a
finding
favorable
to
the
party
who
now
wants
to...
to
the
fugitive
who
now
wants
to
appeal?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
given
the
fact
that
congress
has
so
spoken,
what
kind
of
a
case
might
result
in
an
act
of
discretion
favorable
to...
to
a
waiver
conclusion,
as
opposed
to
a
nonwaiver
conclusion?
when
would
you
ever
come
out
against
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
i
mean
they
can
still
go
after
him
for
escape.
they
can
still
revoke
the
bail.
why
does
the
court
need
it
in
that
case,
rather
than
in
the
case
in
which
he
appeals...
in
which
he
escapes
before
the
appeal
has
begun?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
it's
like
direct
contempt,
as
opposed
to
indirect
contempt?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
they
can
go
ahead
and
decide
the
appeal.
the
defendant
is
never
in
the
courtroom
for
an
appeal.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
i
think
you're
undercutting
that.
i
mean
you're...
you're...
i
don't
see
why
your
rationale
for
prosecution
and
bail
revocation
doesn't
undercut
the
rationale
for
the
so-called
kind
of
direct-contempt
analysis.
