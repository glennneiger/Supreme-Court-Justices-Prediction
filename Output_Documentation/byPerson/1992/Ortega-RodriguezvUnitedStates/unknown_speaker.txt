speaker
ms.
wax,
do
you
mind
starting
at
the
beginning?
is
this
case
just
a
fluke?
i
mean
this
man
was
resentenced
when
he
didn't
have
to
be?
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
authority
for
resentencing?
unknown
speaker
what's
that?
unknown
speaker
did
he
get
a
longer
or
a
shorter
sentence?
unknown
speaker
did
the
district
court
have
authority,
then,
to
reopen
the
sentence?
unknown
speaker
did
the
government
challenge
the
authority?
unknown
speaker
the
second
sentence.
unknown
speaker
took
the
second
sentence.
unknown
speaker
who
was
the
district
judge
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
is
it
your...
does
the
government
have
a
position
as
to
whether
or
not
an
appeal
could
be
dismissed
if
the
appeal
is
from
a
2255...
an
order
pursuant
to
2255
and
the
escape,
or
fugitivity
was
before
the
district
court
made
that
order--
unknown
speaker
--i.e.,
suppose
this
were
a
2255
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
were
a
2255
proceeding.
you'd
take
the
position
that
yes,
it
could
be
dismissed
on
the
ground
of
fugitivity
that
occurred
before
the
2255
action
was
commenced
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
ms.
wax,
if
i
could
just
throw
this
in...
i
probably
shouldn't
interrupt
you...
if
you
say
normal,
procedural
default
principles
should
be
applied,
this
is
a
very
unusual
case.
because
he
can
make
a
pretty
powerful
showing
of
actual
innocence.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
don't
agree
the
facts
are
the
same
as
to
his
codefendant.
unknown
speaker
the
presumption
of--
unknown
speaker
--he's
not
entitled
to
a
reapplication
of
the
presumption
of
innocence
when
there's
not
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he's
guilty?
unknown
speaker
could
i
ask
this?
if
this
sport,
as
justice
o'connor
points
out
because
of
the
long
delay...
would
it
have
been
proper
for
the
eleventh
circuit
to
have
dismissed
the
appeal
if,
after
he
was
found
guilty,
say
they
sent
the
case
to
a
probation
officer
for
a
presentencing
report,
and
set
the
sentencing
date
6
weeks
later,
after
which
the
normal
appeal
process
had
run;
and
if
he
had
fled
during
that
6-week
period
and
been
recaptured
before
sentencing...
on
those
facts,
could
they
dismiss
the
appeal
then?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
flight
had
absolutely
no
impact
on
the
appellate
process,
at
all?
unknown
speaker
or
even
the
sentencing
process?
unknown
speaker
and
what
if,
instead--
unknown
speaker
--of
a
flight
during
the
6-weeks
period,
he
committed
another
offense?
say
he
got
drunk,
or
something
like
that,
in
violation
of
his
probation.
could
they
dismiss
his
appeal
for
that?
unknown
speaker
and
why
not?
what's
the
difference
between
the
two?
i
know--
i
understand
flight
during
an
appeal,
or
something
that
affects
the
proceedings.
but
if
you
make
a
hypothesis
that
has
no
impact
whatsoever
on
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
proceeding,
is
there
still
justification
for
dismissing
the
appeal?
unknown
speaker
don't
we
have
a
general
rule--
unknown
speaker
--that
committing
probation
violations
is
bad,
and
we
don't
want
that
to
happen,
so
we'll
just
use
dismissal
of
appeals
as
a
remedy
for
it.
that's
certainly
rational.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
assuming
it
doesn't--
unknown
speaker
--just
as
this
case
it
doesn't.
unknown
speaker
so
if...
appeal
dismissal--
unknown
speaker
--is
sort
of
an
all-purpose
weapon
to
deter
improper
conduct.
unknown
speaker
ms.
wax,
certainly...
i
mean
do
i
really
have
to
buy
into
the...
into
the
one
if
i
buy
into
the
other?
i
mean
isn't
it
a
perfectly
reasonable
distinction
between
parole
violations
that
fugitivity
during
the
course
of
the
trial,
or
before
the
appeal
has
been
perfected
demonstrates
a...
a
contempt
for
the
judicial
process
that's
in
front
of
the
court?
and
the
court
is
not
punishing
evil-doing
at
large,
but
punishing
evil-doing
that
has
to
do
with
this
very
proceeding
before
this
very
court
system.
unknown
speaker
so
it
is
tied
into
the
particular
case,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
justice--
unknown
speaker
--stevens
gives
you
a
situation
where
nothing
good
is
accomplished
by...
in
a
practical
sense...
by
dismissing
for
the
fugitivity,
either.
unknown
speaker
no
time's
been
lost
or
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
well,
doesn't...
ms.
wax,
doesn't
there
have
to
be
some
connection
with
the
appellate
process?
i
mean
take
justice
stevens'
hypothesis
a
step
further.
supposing
the
guy
creates
trouble
before
he's
tried
in
jail...
he
wants
more
food,
and
they
won't
give
it
to
him,
so
he
starts
a
riot.
would
that
be
a
reason
for...
if
he's
ultimately
convicted...
for
dismissing
his
appeal?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--but
what...
what
effect
does
the
probation
hypothesis
given
to
you
by
justice
stevens
have
on
the
appellate
process?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
a
rationality
standard.
unknown
speaker
the
rule
the
court
of
appeals
adopts
has
to
be
rationally
related
to
the
integrity
of
the
court
process.
is
that
what
it
is?
unknown
speaker
or
to
the
orderly
functioning
of
the
appellate
court
process?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
do--
unknown
speaker
--if
there
was...
there
were
a
rule
or
a
line
of
decisions
which
required
dismissal
of
the
appeal
if
there
was
an
attempt,
abortive
attempt,
to
escape?
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
rule
have
to
relate
at
all
to
flouting
of
the
appellate
court's
authority?
it's
the
appellate
court
that's
adopting
the
rule.
or,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
rule
can
encompass
some
flouting
of
the
district
court's
authority...
even
though
the
district
court
didn't
see
fit
to
enforce
any
such
discipline?
unknown
speaker
must
there
be
prejudice
found?
unknown
speaker
you
think
the
rule
can
apply
as
a
blanket
rule
in
the
absence
of
any
prejudice
in
the
particular
case--
unknown
speaker
--to
the
appellate
process?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
the...
certainly
his
taking
off
prevented
the
court
of
appeals
from
entertaining
an
appeal
in
a
timely
fashion.
and
if
appeal
is
now
allowed,
you're
going
to
have
two
cases
instead
of
one,
maybe
by
different
panels...
things
like
that.
so
in
a
normal
course
of
events,
the...
the
court
probably
would
have
heard
his
appeal
along
with
his
codefendant's.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
another
question?
what
was
the
rule
that
the
court
of
appeals
applied
here?
do
we
know?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
there
some
prior
case
in
which
they
articulated
the
reasons
for
dismissing
in
circumstances
like
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
did
the--
unknown
speaker
--was
this...
from
the
same
circuit,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
and
what
did
they
say?
unknown
speaker
that
in
any
case
they're
going
to
dismiss?
unknown
speaker
now
dismiss
the
case--
unknown
speaker
--dismiss
the
appeal
that
had
already
been
filed?
unknown
speaker
so
he
did
file
a
timely
appeal?
unknown
speaker
ms.
wax,
is
it
correct
that
in
the
cases
where
they
have
dismissed
the...
where
there
was
a
flight
before
sentencing,
that
the
flight
was
long
enough
to
delay
the
sentencing,
ergo
the
appellate
process
as
well?
none
of
these
cases
are
like
my
hypothetical,
in
other
words...
they're
a
flight
that
didn't
delay
the
sentencing
hearing.
unknown
speaker
2
years,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
but
they
don't
have
to
be
gone
very
long
to
hang
up
the
appellate
process.
unknown
speaker
could
the
appellate
court
prohibit
any
appeal
from
the
sentencing?
unknown
speaker
ms.
wax,
you
were
frightening
me
a
moment
ago
when
you
seemed
to
be
on
route
to
saying
that
we
really
don't
know
in
this
case
whether
they
were
applying
a
rule
or
indeed
were
engaging
in
case-by-case
determination.
i
mean
did
we
take
this
case
just
to
decide
whether
their
case-by-case
determination
was
correct?
i
thought
at
least
there
was
agreement
here
that
a
rule
was
being
applied.
but
you
say
maybe
not.
this
is
an
overwhelmingly
insignificant
case,
if
that's
so.
unknown
speaker
moreso
than
i
had
thought.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
oh,
okay.
unknown
speaker
although
you
may
have
to
do
it--
unknown
speaker
--i
see,
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
that's
comforting.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
ms.
wax,
just
out
of
curiosity,
how
bit
a
problem
is
it?
how
often
do
these
dismissals
occur?
do
you
know?
do
you
have
any
idea,
statistically...
you
know,
once
every
year
or
2,
or--
unknown
speaker
--at
least
once.
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
one
in
the
first
circuit
that
we're
curren--
unknown
speaker
--i
guess.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
whether
the
united
states
attorney
appeared
personally
to
oppose,
or
filed
a
piece
of
paper,
himself,
opposing
the
motion
to
resentence?
unknown
speaker
well,
at
the
resentencing,
but
was
he
at
the...
when
the
motion
was
granted?
because
i--
unknown
speaker
--i
see
the
last
paragraph
of
the
public
defender's
statement
says
i
am...
the
united
states
attorney
opposes
this
motion.
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right--
unknown
speaker
--but
was
he--
unknown
speaker
--there
to--
unknown
speaker
--was
he
there
to
oppose
the
granting
of
the
motion
to--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
go
back
to
your
flouting
authority
rationale?
supposing
the
defendant
went
on
the
air
and
called
all
the
judges
that
are
going
to
sit
on
the
appeal
dishonest,
and
crooked,
and
so
forth...
and
really
flouted
the
authority.
could
you
dismiss
the
appeal
for
that
reason?
and
if
not,
why
isn't
the
flight
just
a
form
of
symbolic
speech?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
just
confining--
unknown
speaker
--it
to
that
one
rationale.
unknown
speaker
your
flouting
the--
unknown
speaker
--your
flouting
the
authority
rationale,
seems
to
me
strictly
a
first
amendment
problem.
unknown
speaker
we
understand
the
rest
of
the
reason,
if
you
delay,
and
all
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
he
burned
the
flag.
could
you
dismiss
his
appeal
for
that
reason?
unknown
speaker
not
burning
pictures
of--
unknown
speaker
--judges
or
anything
like
that?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
if
he
burned
the
flag
in
the
courtroom
you
could
penalize
him,
couldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
burn
the--
unknown
speaker
--courtroom,
right?
unknown
speaker
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
ms.
wax.
the
case
is
submitted.
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
