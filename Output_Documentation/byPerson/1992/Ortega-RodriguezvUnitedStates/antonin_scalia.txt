while
you
are
there,
what
if
that
automatic
rule
would
be
bad;
but
a
lesser
automatic
rule
would
have
been
okay,
an
automatic
rule
involving
fewer
situations
would
have
been
okay...
and
this
situation
comes
within
that
lesser
category?
what
would
be
the
situation
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
cannot
have
any
precedent...
precedential
decisions,
then,
can't
say,
you
know,
whenever
fact
a,
b,
and
c
is
present,
you
lose.
you
can't
do
that?
that's
just
ordinary
precedent.
i
thought
everything
we
do
is
governed
by
precedent.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
to
reinvent
the
wheel
every
time
a
case
comes...
i
mean,
the
judge
can't
say,
gee,
we
had
a
case
just
like
this
2
weeks
ago,
and
there
we
held
factors
a,
b,
and
c
being
present,
you're
out.
but
we
have
to
rethink
it
again
this
time.
they
really
have
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
finish
that,
if
you
were
answering
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh
good.
well,
don't
move
on
just
for
a
minute.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that...
that...
that
the
consequence
of
your
proposition
that
each
case
has
to
be
decided
on
its
own
facts
is
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
abuse
of
discretion,
right?
i...
i
guess...
i
guess
a
court
could
never
be
reversed
for
either...
either
dismissing
or
not
dismissing
because
of
the
fugitiveness.
what
basis
would
you
have
to
reverse?
i
mean
you
reverse
because
some
general
has
been
violated.
and
you're
telling
us
there
are
no
general
principles.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
could
you
possibly
abuse
discretion
that
is
not
subject
to
any
general
rules?
you
say
that
no
general
rules
exist.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gailey,
can
you
explain
to
me
why
you
are
willing
to
concede...
as
i
think
you
have...
that
courts
without
special
statutory
authorization
can
establish
time
limits
for
filing
of
notice
of
appeal
and
say
if
you
don't
meet
those
limits,
you
are
out;
without
going
case
by
case
and
saying
well,
you
know,
this
fellow
came
within
2
weeks,
but
there's
a
lot
of
trouble
at
home.
it
isn't
a
case-by-case
evaluation.
you
have
a
time
limit,
and
that's
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
is
it
okay
there,
but
it's
not
okay
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand...
you
mean
those
rules
would
not...
a
court
would
not
be
able
to
have
such
rules
unless
they
were
submitted
to
congress
and
made
statutory?
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
have
those
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
exercise
of
its
own
supervisory
authority.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
didn't...
but
we
didn't
ascertain
that
it
was
not
a
rule,
which
is
what
you
want
us
to
ascertain
here.
you
want
us
to
say
since
it
is
a
rule,
it's
bad.
