well,
is
it
true,
as
the
other
side
argues,
that
if
it
had
done
that,
the
act
would
in
fact
have
constituted
a
misstatement
about
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
minor
crimes?
justice
david
h.

but
it
could
have
been
a
good
reason--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
it
could
have
been
a
good
reason
to
drop
the
word
concurrent
just
because
there
was
disagreement
over
that
and
those
who
finally
passed
the
legislation
were
of
one
view,
i.e.,
that
there
was
not
jurisdiction
over
the
minor
crimes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
could,
but
it
clearly
did
not
want
to
do
so
with
respect
to
minor
crimes.
justice

of
course,
in
your
view,
it
would
have
been
very
simple...
if
i
may
just
interrupt
you
on
the
textual
point,
it
would
have
been
very
simple
in
the
second
sentence
simply
to
add
one
more
word.
this
section
shall
not
deprive
the
courts
of
the
united
states
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
offenses.
that
would
have
been
the
textually
easier
way
to
get
to
the
point
that
you
want
us
to
reach,
and
yet
congress
didn't
follow
that.
