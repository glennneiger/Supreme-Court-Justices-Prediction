justice
john
paul
stevens
general
stephan,
can
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
both
the
legislative
history
and
your
statement
just
now
indicated
the
four
tribes
all
supported
this
legislation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
does
that
square
with
the
amicus
briefs
and
the
correspondence
in
the
amicus
briefs?
the
legislative
history
is
all
second-hand
information,
but
the
original
tribal
records
seem
to
point
in
the
other
direction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
records
themselves
say
we,
the
business
community,
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
take
the
other...
voted
by
a
majority
the
other
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
we
don't
know
today,
how
do
we
know
the
secretary
knew
back
when
the
act
was
passed?
i
mean,
his
information
is
all
second-hand,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
this
is
a
pretty
good
argument
for
not
looking
at
legislative
history.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
seems
somewhat
inconsistent
with
your...
excuse
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.
thompson,
can
i
make
one
comment
that
you
might
want
to
comment
on.
you
take
congressman
lambertson
as
the
gospel
on
these
issues,
and
he
said
the
indians
were
in
favor
of
the
legislation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
also
says,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
all
parties
are
agreed
on
this
bill,
the
indians
and
so
forth.
so
he
thought
the
indians
wanted
this
bill
enacted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your...
the
amicus
brief
suggests
that
the
indians
were
opposed
to
the
bill,
period,
not
as
to
part
of
it,
and
this
history
suggests
they
were
in
favor
of
the
bill.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
it
is
clear
the
record
before
congress
indicated
the
indians
favored
this
legislation.
