justice

anyway,
why
does
the
united
states
not
continue
to
have
exclusive
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
continue
to
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
federal
crimes,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
the
government's
position
that
the
state
of
kansas
can
try
federal
offenses
in
kansas
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
therefore
the
united
states
courts
continue
to
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
federal
crimes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
there's
a
little
confusion
that
arises
from
your
use
in
your
brief...
and
maybe
there's
no
other
term,
but
usually
when
you
say
concurrent
jurisdiction
you
mean
that
two
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
the
same
cause
of
action,
or
over
the
same
criminal
offense.
that's
not
what's
at
issue
here.
what's
at
issue
here
is
concurrent
legislative
jurisdiction,
in
a
sense.
that
is,
the
state
courts...
the
state
government
can
make
criminal
under
state
law
certain
acts
on
the
reservation
and
try
those
offenses
in
state
court,
and
the
federal
government
may
make
criminal
similar
acts
under
federal
law
and
try
those
in
federal
courts.
so
that
the
state
courts
and
the
federal
courts
don't
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
they
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
their
separate
crimes,
but
it's
only
the
legislative
jurisdiction
that's
concurrent--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that's
really
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
on
the
other
hand,
you
could
look
upon
it
as
granting
indian
tribes
the
great
benefit
of
being
protected
by
two
criminal
laws,
federal
law
and
state
law.
they
can
get
the
fbi
to
protect
them
as
well
as
local
law
enforcement
officers.
i
do
not
know
why,
in
determining
whether
indians
are
being
harmed
or
benefited
by
this
interpretation,
we
have
to
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
indian
criminal
instead
of
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
indian
noncriminal.
why
isn't
it
an
advantage
to
the
indian
tribes
to
be
protected
by
both
state
and
federal
criminal
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
have
sovereignty
anyway.
i
mean,
the
criminal
law
is
going
to...
it's
not
tribal
criminal
law
that's
going
to
govern,
no
matter
what,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
would
it
be
implicit?
wouldn't
that
be
an
explicit
repeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
have
a
prior
statute
that
says
grass
is
green
and
a
later
statute
is
passed
that
says
grass
is
blue,
that
is
not
an
implicit
repeal
of
the
earlier
statute,
it
is
an
explicit
repeal.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
say
in
the
later
statute
to
achieve
an
explicit
repeal
grass
is
blue
and
not
green.
i
think
it's
enough
to
say
grass
is
blue.
it
repeals
the
earlier
one,
doesn't
it,
and
that
would
certainly
be
the
case
if
you
only
had
the
first
paragraph,
as
the
chief
justice
questioned.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
stephan--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
would
agree
with
you
that
the
major
crimes
act
does
not
imply
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
but
simply
describes
the
jurisdiction
whose
laws
are
applied,
namely
those
laws
that
exist
where
the
united
states
has
exclusive
jurisdiction.
i
would
agree
with
that
but
for
one
word.
subsection
(a)
says,
shall
be
subject
to
the
same
law
and
penalties...
it
does
not
say,
as
persons
committing
any
of
the
above
offenses
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
it
says...
not,
as
all
persons,
it
says,
as
all
other
persons
committing
any
of
the
above
offenses
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
now,
the
implication
of
the
word,
other,
is
that
an
indian
committing
such
an
offense
is
a
person
committing
that
offense
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
isn't
that
the
implication
of
using
the
word,
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right,
but
does
it
not
imply
that
that
indian
perpetrator
is
a
perpetrator
acting
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
because
it
uses
the
word
other?
he
shall
be
treated
the
same
as
all
other
persons
committing
any
of
the
above
offenses
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
that,
but
i
find
within
the
act
itself
the
word,
other,
that
certainly
suggests
to
me
that
the
act
at
least
implies
exclusivity.
now,
one
can
argue
that
it
is
nonetheless
subsequently
amended
by
3243,
but
it
seems
to
me
the
word,
other,
does
imply
that
an
indian
perpetrator
is
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
