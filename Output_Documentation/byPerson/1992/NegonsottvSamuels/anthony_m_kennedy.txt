what
crime
covered
by
the
federal
major
crimes
act
most
closely
parallels
the
state
crime?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
(c)
and
(f).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
indian
tribes
in
the
state
of
kansas
which
have
their
own
tribal
courts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
tribal
courts
punish
minor
offenses,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
jurisdiction,
i
take
it,
would
be
shared
by
the
state
of
kansas
under
your
interpretation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so,
then,
it's
not
correct
to
say
that
kansas
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
minor
crimes,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
state
acting
as
the
agent
of
the
federal
government
when
it
prosecutes
under
its
own
laws?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i
take
it
there
would
be
no
objection
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
multiple
prosecutions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
order
for
that
result
to
obtain,
is
it
necessary
to
say
that
what
the
federal
government
has
done
is
to
acquiesce
in
the
exercise
of
state
authority?
is
that
the
way
it
works?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there's
either
acguiescence
or
delegation.
the
only
reason
i
ask
is,
if
there
is
a
double
jeopardy
problem,
that
might
be
one
argument
in
favor
of
construing
the
statute
as
the
petitioner
wishes
us
to
do.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
like
in
barkus
v.
illinois,
but
there
the
state
has
its
own
sovereignty
that
it's
exercising,
and
i'm
just
asking
you
if
we
can't
interpret
this
act
as
allowing
the
state
to
exercise
its
own
sovereignty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
seems
somewhat
inconsistent
with
your
saying
that
the
united
states
has
delegated
its
power
to
the
states.
