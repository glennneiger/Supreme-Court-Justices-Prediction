mr.
robert
t.
stephan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
respond
to
some
of
the
statements
made
by
ms.
thompson,
but
first
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
the
kansas
act
has
done
exactly
what
the
congress
intended.
it's
legalized
the
enforcement
of
major
and
minor
crimes
on
the
kansas
reservations,
it's
provided
courts
where
there
were
none.
true,
there
is
now
one
court
on
the
kickapoo
nation
reservation,
but
it
is
virtually
just
getting
underway.
the
other
three
tribes
have
no
tribal
courts.
it
met
the
requests
of
the
four
kansas
tribes
in
1940
when
it
was
enacted.
it
eliminated
the
administrative
nightmare
at
the
time
of
trying
to
determine
where
the
crime
occurred
on
the
reservation.
was
it
a
part
of
an
unrestricted
allotment,
or
was
it
a
part
of
trust
property,
a
restricted
allotment,
and
two-thirds
of
the
land
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
this
act
was...
consisted
of
unrestricted
allotments.
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
the
kickapoo...
all
of
the
reservations
are
in
the
northeast
part
of
the
state
of
kansas,
and
they're
brown
county,
jackson
county,
in
that
area
of
the
state.
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
yes.
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
yes.
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
well,
the
letter
referred
to,
the
potawatomi
business
council,
in
those
letters
the
author
of
the
letters
also
referred
to
another
potawatomi
business
council,
but
he
didn't
agree
with
that
council,
so
there
was
obviously
a
split
of
some
kind
in
the
tribe,
but...
and
they
also
indicated
in
the
letter
that
they
realized
that
this
would
maintain
full
jurisdiction
to
the
state
of
kansas,
and
seemed
to
be
more
concerned
about
an
attempt
by
brown
and
jackson
counties
in
kansas
to
collect
taxes,
and
they
thought
this
was
a
guise
to
collect
taxes
that
evidently
they'd
received
a
judgment
for
in
a
federal
court,
and
that
brown
and
jackson
county
were
trying
to
evade
those
taxes.
and
when
you
take
that
along
with
the
statements
of
the
secretary
of
interior...
secretary
burlew
at
the
time...
and
the
superintendent
and
the
memorandum
attached,
they
say
all
four
tribal
councils
wanted
this
legislation,
and
i
think
that
has
to
be
given
great
credence.
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
well,
the
business
council,
but
we
don't
know
exactly
who
this
business
council
is.
in
the
letter--
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
--well,
it's
all
second-hand,
but
i
guess
we've
got
one
tribe
and
he's
talking
about
all
four,
so
at
least
it's
three
to
one,
and
i
would
give
great
credence...
he
was
the
trustee
for
the
indian
tribes.
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
well,
it
could
be
that,
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
stay
away
from
it.
[laughter]
counsel
did
indicate
that
the
kansas
act
is
an
implicit
repeal
of
the
major
crimes
act,
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
major
crimes
act
does
not
preclude
the
state
from
exercising
jurisdiction,
and
certainly
there
is
nothing
that
is
repealed
in
there.
i
notice
the
court's
looking
at
the
map,
i
presume
of
kansas.
they
just
got
14
inches
of
snow
yesterday
in
that
area.
the
overriding
issue
in
this
case
is
over
the
words,
exclusive
jurisdiction,
as
used
in
section
1153,
the
major
crimes
act,
and
do
these
words
mean
that
the
federal
government
has
exclusivity
over
indian
country,
thereby
precluding
the
state
from
exercising
jurisdiction
over
the
major
crimes
listed,
or
do
these
words
identify
the
body
of
law
that
is
to
be
applied
by
the
federal
courts
when
conducting
a
prosecution
over
crimes
committed
in
indian
country?
the
words,
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
major
crimes
act
does
not
mean
that
the
federal
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
prosecution.
the
words
do
not
apply
to
prosecutorial
jurisdiction
extended
over
indian
country,
but
are
only
used
as
a
description
of
the
laws
which
are
extended
to
it.
the
clause
refers
to
the
body
of
law
and
procedure,
and
not
to
the
exclusivity
of
prosecution.
it
does
not
confer
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
but
identifies
the
law
that
is
applied
in
those
courts.
of
course,
since
jurisdiction
over
indian
country
can
only
be
obtained
through
an
act
of
congress,
only
the
federal
government
could
exercise
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
section
1153,
unless
through
another
act
of
congress
kansas
was
given
jurisdiction
in
indian
country.
it
is
not
the
language,
exclusive
jurisdiction,
as
used
in
section
1153,
that
precludes
the
exercise
of
state
jurisdiction
over
conduct
by
indians
in
indian
country.
the
preclusion
flows
from
the
general
principles
that
the
state
has
no
inherent
jurisdiction
over
indians
in
indian
country,
and
may
exercise
jurisdiction
only
where,
as
authorized
in
the
kansas
act,
there
is
a
clear
grant
of
authority
by
congress.
where
does
exclusivity
come
from
in
the
major
crimes
act?
the
exclusivity
comes
from
the
fact
that
congress
delegated
authority
to
the
united
states
in
that
act,
and
it
means
exactly
what
it
says.
you
have
to
look
at
more
than
the
word,
exclusive,
and
examine
the
section
in
its
entirety,
and
when
this
is
done,
you
can
see
that
exclusivity
refers
to
the
manner
and
body
of
federal
law
which
shall
be
applied,
and
that
section--
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
--no,
the
state
is
not
acting
as
the
agent
of
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
has
given
the
state
authority
to
execute
its
laws,
the
state
laws,
in
regard
to
crimes
that
occur
on
the
reservation.
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
that
issue
has
never
been
met
by...
i
am
convinced
at
this
point
that
certainly
the
better
line
of
thought
is
that
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
a
prosecution
by
both
the
federal
and
the
state
government.
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
i
don't
know
that
there's
acquiescence,
because
the
state
is
not
required
to
maintain
the
prosecution.
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
well,
double
jeopardy
has
certainly
been
an
issue
that
has
been
raised
in
other
circumstances,
and
there
are
prosecutions
today
under
both
state
and
federal
law
that
arise
from
the
same
set
of
facts,
and
double
jeopardy
is
not
a
problem
in
those
instances,
and
the
same
is
true
in
regard
to
indian
reservations.
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
well,
the
state
does
exercise
its
sovereignty
in
accordance
with
these
acts--
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
if
i
said
that,
then
i
misspoke,
because
no
federal
power
was
delegated
to
the
state.
the
congress
granted
to
the
state
authority
to
enforce
its
laws
on
the
indian
reservations.
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
well,
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
this
major
crimes
act
applies
to
an
indian
perpetrator,
whether
or
not
the
victim
is
an
indian
or
a
non-indian.
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
the
term,
exclusive
jurisdiction,
is
an
extension
of
the
laws
on
federal
enclaves,
and
is
not...
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
not
maintained
from
the
language
of
the
act
itself,
but
from
the
fact
that
in
the
major
crimes
act
no
authority
is
delegated
to
the
states.
mr.
robert
t.
stephan
well,
the
major
crimes
act
was
originally
enacted
as
a
result
of
the
crow
dog
case
that
said
they
did
not
have...
that
the
federal
government
did
not
have
jurisdiction
on
the
reservation
in
regard
to
a
particular
murder
case
where
one
indian
murdered
another
indian
because
it
was
not
a
federal
enclave.
so
when
you...
so
the
major
crimes
act
was
enacted,
and
its
purpose
was
to
solve
that
problem
and
to
make
certain
that
major
crimes
were
prosecutable
by
the
united
states,
and
even
in
that
case,
or
the
subsequent
case
of
kagama
that
construed
the
major
crimes
act,
this
court
made
it
very
clear
that
that
did
not
express
limitations
upon
the
powers
of
the
state.
even
with
the
cases
that
have
talked
about
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government,
this
matter
has
not
spoken
to
a
limitation
in
regard
to
the
powers
of
the
state.
ms.
thompson
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
language,
shall
not
deprive,
is
mandatory,
and
therefore
kansas
doesn't
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
and
i
think
that
meets
basically
the
same
issue
that
we
just
discussed.
this
reserves
a
right
to
the
federal
government
to
proceed
accordingly
with
the
laws
that
it
has
enacted.
the
kansas
act
is
unambiguous.
the
first
sentence,
standing
alone,
unambiguously
confers
on
kansas
criminal
jurisdiction
over
all
criminal
offenses
committed
by
or
against
indians
on
indian
reservations.
congress
by
the
passage
of
the
kansas
act
granted
to
kansas
jurisdiction
that
had
only
been
granted...
previously
had
only
been
granted
to
the
federal
government.
just
as
unambiguously,
the
second
sentence
preserved
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
over
crimes
defined
by
federal
law.
the
federal
courts
retained
their
jurisdiction
to
entertain
any
prosecution
under
the
major
crimes
act.
the
canon
of
construction
that
full
effect
should
be
given
to
all
of
the
statute's
language
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
the
federal
government
has
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
state's
unqualified
grant
of
authority.
congress
created
a
body
of
law
that
applies
to
federal
enclaves
that
are
within
the
sole
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
by
the
enactment
of
the
federal
enclaves
act.
this
body
of
law
was
extended
to
indian
country
by
the
major
crimes
act
and
the
general
crimes
act,
but
those
acts
do
not
make
indian
country
a
federal
enclave,
and
for
that
reason,
it
is
the
body
of
law
that
applies
and
not
the
exclusive
authority
of
the
courts
of
the
united
states
that
was
extended
to
indian
country.
and
so
reference
to,
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states,
refers
to
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
body
of
law
to
be
extended
to
indian
country,
and
not
the
type
of
jurisdiction
that
was
conferred
upon
the
federal
courts,
because
congress
did
not
make
indian
country
a
federal
enclave.
this
act
has
worked
as
it
should.
it
served
the
tribes
and
the
people
of
the
state
of
kansas
well,
and
the
judgment
of
the
tenth
circuit
was
correct.
