ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
before
the
court
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
from
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
issue
for
decision
is
whether
18
u.s.
code
section
3243
prohibits
the
state
of
kansas
from
exercising
criminal
jurisdiction
over
an
offense
defined
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states
and
enumerated
in
the
major
crimes
act,
18
u.s.
code
1153.
section
3243
was
passed
by
congress
in
1940,
and
it
conferred
jurisdiction
on
kansas
over
intra-indian
offenses
to
the
same
extent
as
its
courts
had
jurisdiction
over
offenses
committed
elsewhere
within
the
state
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
state.
however,
congress
added
a
proviso
which
states
that
the
courts
of
the
united
states
shall
not
be
deprived
of
jurisdiction
over
offenses
defined
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
the
first
court
to
interpret
section
3243
was
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
the
case
of
youngbear
v.
brewer.
this
1977
decision
upheld
a
lower
court's
finding
that
iowa's
jurisdictional
statute,
which
is
virtually
identical
to
the
kansas
act,
did
not
grant
iowa
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
federal
courts
over
offenses
defined
by
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
in
1982,
the
kansas
supreme
court,
following
the
reasoning
and
analysis
of
the
eighth
circuit
in
youngbear,
held
that
the
federal
courts
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
federal
offenses
defined
in
the
major
crimes
act.
then
in
1986,
in
the
case
of
state
of
kansas
v.
negonsott,
the
kansas
supreme
court
reversed
itself,
holding
that
the
state
had
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
the
federal
courts
over
major
crimes.
it
is
that
decision
of
the
kansas
supreme
court
which
ultimately
gave
rise
to
this
case.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
not
in
dispute.
briefly,
mr.
negonsott
was
arrested,
tried,
and
convicted
by
state
authorities
in
state
court
for
the
crime
of
aggravated
battery.
now,
this
crime
occurred
within
the
confines
of
the
kickapoo
reservation,
and
both
mr.
negonsott
and
the
victim
were
enrolled
members
of
the
kickapoo
nation
in
kansas.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
it
would
be
those
crimes
found
in
18
u.s.
code
section
113
(c)
and
(f),
which
is
basically
assault
with
a
dangerous
weapon.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
(c)
and
(f).
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
mr.
negonsott
challenged
his
conviction
by
filing
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
the
federal
district
court,
attacking,
of
course,
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts.
the
tenth
circuit
upheld
the
district
court's
dismissal
of
the
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
finding
that
18
u.s.
code
3243
granted
kansas
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
federal
crimes
which
are
also
defined
by
state
law.
it
is
our
contention
that
this
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
violates
generally
accepted
principles
of
federal
indian
law,
and
is
also
contrary
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
yes,
your
honor,
i'm...
justice
rehnquist.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
if
you
take
the
language
of
the
proviso,
where
it
says,
shall
not
deprive
the
courts
of
the
united
states,
it's
our
contention
that
shall
not
deprive
is
not
language
granting
concurrent
jurisdiction.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
because
it's
mandatory...
shall
not
deprive
the
courts
of
the
united
states.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
it
has
been
deprived
of
exclusive
jurisdiction,
and
as
this
court
has
held
for
the...
at
least
the
last
100
years,
jurisdiction
under
the
major
crimes
act
is
exclusive
with
the
federal
district
courts.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
but
again,
our
contention
is
that
you
have
to
analyze
this
kansas
statute
in
conjunction
with
the
major
crimes
act.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
because
the--
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
--no.
it's
that
jurisdiction
that
is
shared
by
the
state
of
kansas.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
no.
that's
not
the
contention.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
the
contention
is
that--
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
--but
that's
not
how
it's
been...
our
contention
is
that
the
major
crimes
act
is...
defines
federal
offenses,
and
that
therefore
that
fits
right
in
with
the
proviso
of
the
kansas
statute.
the
tenth
circuit
has
held
that
in
that
situation,
where
you
also...
for
example,
aggravated
battery
is
of
course
defined
by
state
law,
and
when
it
is
defined
by
state
law,
then
the
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
that's
true.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
yes.
since,
as
this
court
stated
in
canon
v.
university
of
chicago
that
congress
acts
with
knowledge
of
existing
law
and,
therefore,
absent
a
clear
manifestation
of
contrary
intent
a
newly-enacted
statute
is
presumed
to
be
harmonious
with
existing
law
and
its
judicial
construction,
any
analysis
of
the
kansas
act
must
be
made
in
conjunction
with
the
major
crimes
act.
now,
the
major
crimes
act
was
passed
by
congress
in
1885
to
fill
the
jurisdictional
void
left
by
this
court's
decision
in
ex
parte
crow
dog,
because
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
major
crimes
act,
tribal
courts
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
crimes
committed
within
their
reservation
boundaries.
now,
the
major
crimes
act
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court
since
united
states
v.
kagama
as
vesting
exclusive
jurisdiction
with
the
federal
courts
for
an
indian
defendant
committing
one
of
its
enumerated
crimes,
because
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
provide
a
federal
forum
for
the
prosecution
of
major
crimes
and
to
protect
indians
from
prosecution
in
state
court.
now,
in
united
states
v.
kagama
this
court
detailed
many
reasons
why
it
felt
the
federal
courts
had
to
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
these
major
crimes:
1)
that
indian
nations
were,
and
continue
to
be
today,
wards
of
the
nation,
dependent
on
the
united
states
government
for
all
political
rights.
secondly,
because
of
local
ill
feeling,
the
people
of
the
states
where
they
are
found
are
often
their
deadliest
enemies,
and
therefore
federal
jurisdiction
was
necessary
for
their
protection.
in
other
words,
the
purpose
of
the
act
was
to
protect
indians
from
the
prejudices
of
their
non-indian
neighbors,
and
to
preclude
state
legislative
interference
in
their
affairs.
now,
despite
kagama
and
its
progeny,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
congress
impliedly
modified
the
exclusivity
of
the
federal
courts
under
the
major
crimes
act.
it
is
our
contention
that
had
congress
wished
to
modify
the
major
crimes
act
as
it
pertained
to
kansas,
it
could
have
done
so
by
passing
the
first
version
of
the
bill,
which
is
found
in
'86
congressional
record,
5596,
and
which
is
set
forth
verbatim
in
my
brief.
now,
this
version
expressly
provided
for
concurrent
jurisdiction,
and
explicitly
modified
the
major
crimes
act
as
it
pertained
to
kansas.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
at
the
time
that
the
act
was
passed,
it
was
unclear
whether
or
not
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
the
general
crimes
act,
applied
in
indian
country,
and
that
issue
was
not
decided
until
the
decision
in
williams
v.
united
states
in
1946--
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
--by
this
court.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
it
could
have
been
a
good
reason,
but
on
the
other
hand,
justice
souter,
congress
has
plenary
power
to
deal
with
indian
affairs.
had
it
wanted
to
grant
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
the
state
and
the
federal
government
under...
well,
what
became
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
it
could
have
done
so.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
that's
clear
from
the
history.
it's
our
contention
that
deletion
of
the
word
concurrent
and
the
failure
to
modify
the
major
crimes
act
shows
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
grant
kansas
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
major
crimes.
now,
both
the
solicitor
general
and
the
attorney
general,
and,
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals,
excused
the
failure
to
modify
and
to
delete
the
word
concurrent
with
reference
to
secretary
burlew's
letter
which
is
part
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
and
as
you
stated,
justice
souter,
because
it
did
not
reflect
the
true
situation.
however,
as
the
court
in
youngbear
held,
when
legislators
delete
language,
we
may
assume
that
they
intended
to
eliminate
the
effect
of
the
previous
wording,
and
since
congress
chose
not
to
include
language
modifying
the
major
crimes
act,
it
can
be
assumed
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
convey
that
jurisdiction
to
the
state
courts.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
our
contention--
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
--i'm
sorry.
our
contention,
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
kansas
has
jurisdiction
over
small,
misdemeanor
crimes,
that
the
federal
government
retains
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
major
crimes.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
that's
correct,
and
as
we...
as
i
talked
about
before,
the
question
as
to
whether
the
general
crimes
act
and
the
assimilative
crimes
act
apply
to
indian
country
has
been...
this
court
has
held
that,
since
williams
v.
the
united
states,
that
they
do
in
fact
apply
to
indian
country.
the
solicitor
general
brought
up
a
point
in
his
brief
that,
well,
exactly
what
was
the
scope
of
jurisdiction
given
to
kansas?
who
was
going
to
have
jurisdiction
over
general
crimes
or
assimilative
crimes?
i
would
urge
the
court
to
hold
as
the...
well,
while
the
tenth
circuit
has
held
that
assimilative
crimes
are
state
offenses,
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
in
u.s.
v.
bear
and
u.s.
v.
marseilles,
that
when
the
federal
court
adopts
these
assimilative
crimes,
that
they
become
federal
offenses,
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
hold
that
way.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
the...
let
me
give
you
one
example.
the
kickapoo
tribal
court
has
been
in
existence
for
the
past
3
years.
just
last
week,
they
started
to
hear
their
first
misdemeanor
offenses.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
yes.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is.
it's
just
the
fact
that...
well,
one
of
the
reasons
for
the
law
was
the
fact
that
there
was
a
lack
of
tribal
courts,
and
that
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
was
very
reluctant
to
provide
funding
for
the
tribal
courts.
there
had
to
be
a
forum
where
these
small
offenses
could
be
adjudicated.
now,
of
course,
the
tribal
courts
are
hearing
these
offenses.
again,
if
we
take
as
an
example
when
congress
wishes
to
convey
criminal
jurisdiction,
congress
makes
that
intent
unequivocally
clear,
as
it
did
with
public
law
280
jurisdiction...
in
particular,
18
u.s.
code
1162,
which
granted
criminal
jurisdiction
to
six
states,
and
the
law
specifically
modified
the
major
crimes
act,
the
general
crimes
act
and
the
assimilative
crimes
act
as
it
pertained
to
those
states.
it...
and,
of
course,
p.l.
280
was
passed
by
congress
in
1953,
only
a
few
years
after
they
passed
the
iowa
statute
in
1948.
it
seems
only
logical
that
had
congress
wished
to
convey
total
criminal
jurisdiction
to
the
state
of
kansas,
they
would
have
specifically
set
this
forth
in
the
statute.
absent
a
clear
expression
of
congressional
intent,
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
by
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
by
the
attorney
general
and
the
solicitor
general
violates
the
rules
of
statutory
construction,
which
is
applicable
to
indians.
for
example,
laws
must
be
liberally
construed
to
favor
indians,
and
ambiguous
statutes
should
be
liberally
construed
in
the
favor
of
indians
and
not
to
their
prejudice.
that,
of
course,
comes
from
bryan
v.
itasca
county.
to
interpret
the
kansas
act
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
would,
1)
eliminate
the
historically
exclusive
stewardship
of
the
federal
government
over
major
crimes
as
found
in
kagama,
and
secondly
it
would
subject
indians
in
kansas,
in
iowa,
in
north
dakota
to
a
double
prosecution.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
justice
scalia,
we're...
i
am
not
looking
at
this
from
the
point
of
the
indian
criminal.
i
am
looking
at
this
from
the
point
of
indian
and
tribal
sovereignty.
the
more
state
interference--
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
--no,
it's
going
to
be
the
state,
but
again,
we're
looking
at
this
from
the...
because
the
criminal...
the
indian
criminal
defendant,
he's
going
to
be
punished
one
way
or
the
other,
whether
it's
state
court
or
federal
court,
but
we're
looking
at
this
as
an
intrusion
basically
on
the
rights
of
the
tribes
to
make
their
own
laws
and
govern
themselves.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
do
you
mean
supported
this
kansas
act?
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
the
kansas
act.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
well,
as
brought
out
in
the
brief
by
amici
native
american
rights
fund,
as
it
turns
out
that
at
least
one
tribe,
the
potawatomi
tribe,
did
not
support
the
passage
of
this
act,
and
in
the
letters
that
the
chairman
of
the
potawatomi
tribe
wrote
to
chairman
rogers,
it
is
quite
clear
that
they
disagreed
with
the
passage
of
this
act
in
its
entirety.
they
did
not
want
the
state
to
have
any
kind
of
jurisdiction
over
them.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
we
could
not--
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
--we
could
not
find
any...
any
resolution
supporting
the
act.
the
only
thing
that
we
were
able
to
find
in
the
archives
were
these
letters
from
the
potawatomi
tribal
council
to
chairman
rogers
asking
that
the
act
not
be
passed,
so
there
was
not
total
support.
there--
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
--the
only
support
that
we
know
about
is
what
is
stated
in
secretary
burlew's
letter
and
in
the
memo
from
the
department
of
the
interior,
which
is
found
in
the
legislative
history.
of
course,
that
is
his
word
as
to
what
happened,
and
obviously
that's
not
even
true
because
of
the
letters
that
we
found
in
the
archives
from
the
potawatomis
to
chairman
rogers.
other
than
that,
there's
no
expression
of...
there
are
no
letters
from
an
indian
tribe
saying
yes,
we
support
this
bill,
or
from
individual
indians
saying
yes,
we
want
this
bill
passed.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
your
question.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
oh--
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
--no,
it
did
not,
justice
brennan.
in
fact,
the
first
letter
that
was
sent
to
chairman
rogers
was
dated...
april
25th,
1940,
asking
that
the
law
not
be
passed.
the
second
canon
of
construction,
as
found
in
menominee
tribe
v.
the
united
states,
states
that
federal
statutes
should
be
construed
so
as
to
avoid
implicit
repeals.
holding
that
kansas
has
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
major
crimes
would
repeal
the
major
crimes
act
as
it
pertains
to
kansas.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
well,
because
the...
it
is
not
explicitly
stated
in
the
statute
itself
that
the
major
crimes
act
are...
that
the
major
crimes
act
is
modified
as
it
pertains
to
kansas.
our
feeling
is
that
it
would
be
more
of
an
implicit
repeal.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
yes,
because
of...
again
because
of
the
exclusivity
of
federal
courts
under
the
major
crimes
act.
however,
the
state
of
new
york,
which
also...
which
has
a
law
similar
to
the
kansas
law
except
for
the
second
proviso,
in
litigation
under
that
law
the
second
circuit
in
u.s.
v.
cook
has
held
that
that
statute
standing
alone
provides
the
state
and
federal
government
with
concurrent
jurisdiction.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
they
are,
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
what
they
are
trying
to
cure,
and
i
believe
this
by
reviewing
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
there
are
numerous
references
to
the
fact
that
there
are
no
tribal
courts
on
the
reservation,
that
there
is
this
jurisdictional
void
which
has
to
be
filled,
that
the
bureau...
the
department
of
the
interior
is
very
reluctant
to
fund
these
tribal
courts,
and
allegedly
the
tribes
don't
even
want
the
tribal
courts.
now,
there
are,
of
course,
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
major
crimes,
but
the
main
problem...
when
you
look
at
the
situation
in
1940,
the
federal
courts
already
have
jurisdiction
over
the
major
crimes
whether
the
state
was
assuming
that
jurisdiction
or
not.
the
problem
was,
there
are
no
tribal
courts,
and
the
state
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
misdemeanor
offenses.
that
was
the
reason
the
act
was
passed,
was
to
solve
that
problem.
even
today,
the
majority
of
crimes
are
small
crimes,
they're
not
felonies.
they're
not
serious
offenses.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
yes.
yes,
it
would
be.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
at
any
rate,
what
has
happened
is
that
the
major
crimes
act
has
been
repealed
by
this
statute,
without
congress
ever
allowing
that
or
authorizing
that
to
happen.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
well,
justice
o'connor,
in...
it
may
not
affect
the
ability
of
the
united
states
government
to
define
crimes
or
punish
crimes,
but
as
it's
working
out,
the
state
of
kansas
is
assuming
total
jurisdiction.
there
is
never
a
case
that
is
going
to
go
to
federal
court,
so
for--
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
--nothing
would
prevent...
in
fact,
that's
one
of
the
problems
with
the--
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
--it
is.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
because
it's
been
deprived
of
its
exclusivity.
when
the
state
can
prosecute
an
indian
defendant,
when
it
is
allowed
to
do
that,
the
federal
courts
no
longer
have
exclusive
jurisdiction.
it's
not
a
situation
of
depriving
the
federal
court.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
no,
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
over
state
crimes,
but
the
problem
is...
from
the
other
way
is
that
the
state
has
jurisdiction
over
these
federally
defined
offenses,
that's
the
problem.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
yes,
i'm
sorry,
i
should
have...
of
an
offense
that
is
a
crime
under
both
the
state
and
under
the
federal
government.
just
very
briefly
i'd
like
to
review
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
which
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
did,
because
it
found
the
act
ambiguous,
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
pay
the
most
attention
to
the
letter
from
congressman
lambertson
which
again
is
set
forth
in
total
in
petitioner's
brief.
in
that
letter,
the
congressman,
who
of
course
was
elected
by
the
people
on
or
near
the
reservation,
states
that
all
parties
are
agreed
that
the
state
of
kansas
was
to
have
full
jurisdiction
for
full
crimes.
now,
the
solicitor
general
and
the
attorney
general
have
basically
made
up...
or
have
determined
that
that
letter
perhaps
should
not
be
given
the
full
credence
that
it
should,
because,
again
there
is
no
mention
in
that
letter
that
kansas
was
to
have
any
jurisdiction
over
the
major
crimes,
and
according
to
woodward
manufacturing
v.
the
ncrb,
it
is
the
sponsors
that
we
look
to
when
we
are
determining
the
statutory
word
in
doubt.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
thank
you.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
the
first
point
i'd
like
to
make
is
regarding
the
argument
of
double
jeopardy.
it's
not
our
contention
that
the
state
of
kansas,
when
it's
acting
under
this
law,
and
the
federal
government...
the
state
of
kansas
when
it's
acting
under
this
law
is
some
sort
of
an
arm
of
the
united
states
government.
our
contention
has
always
been
that
the
united
states
government
is
one
sovereign
and
the
state
of
kansas
is
another
sovereign,
and
therefore
an
indian
person
could,
conceivably,
be
left
wide
open
to
double
prosecution
by
both
the
federal
government
and
by
the
state
courts.
secondly,
regarding
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
again
i
would
urge
the
court
to
give
full
credence
to
what
congressman
lambertson
said
in
his
letter...
that
the
state
of
kansas
was
to
get
full
jurisdiction
for
small
offenses.
this
is
an
expression
of
the
will
of
congress.
if
the
state
of
kansas
was
to
have
jurisdiction...
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
major
crimes,
certainly
congressman
lambertson
would
have
put
that
in
his
letter.
it
would
have
taken
another
five
or
six
words
to
say,
and
the
state
will
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
major
crimes.
taking
into
consideration
the
fact
that,
as
this
court
has
held
for
the
past
100-plus
years,
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
over
the
major
crimes
is
exclusive
technically
under
this
law,
that
does
not
do
away
with
the
exclusivity
of
the
federal
courts.
however,
in
reality
it
does,
because
if
the
laws--
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
--no,
they
did
not
do
that,
and
again,
when
they...
congress
in
1953
was
in
the
process
of
passing
public
law
280,
they
were
very
specific
in
granting
the
states
given
criminal
jurisdiction
that
the
major
crimes
act
and
the
general
crimes
act
and
the
assimilative
crimes
act
would
be
modified
accordingly.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
because
i
believe
from
that
letter
it
is
clear
that
he
is
interpreting
the
legislation.
the
will
of
congress
is
that--
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
--but
again,
only
for
small
offenses.
as
you
know,
the
legislative
history
of
the
act
is
only
four
or
five
pages.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
i
can't
answer
that
question.
perhaps--
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
--that's
true.
ms.
pamela
s.
thompson
thank
you.
