well,
that
goes
back
to
the
question
i
think
justice
scalia
asked
you,
because
how
does
it
in
any
way
affect
the
authority
of
the
united
states
to
define,
prosecute,
and
punish
major
crimes?
it
doesn't.
so
how
is
that
some
kind
of
a
repeal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
prevent
the
federal
government
from
prosecuting
this
same
man
for
a
federal
offense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it's
open
to
the
federal
government
to
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
has
it
been
deprived
of
anything?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
federal
court
still
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
federal
crimes.
it
just
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
over
state
crimes,
but
it
never
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
the
state
has
jurisdiction
over
the
state-defined
offenses.
