we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
91-5397,
emery
l.
negonsott
v.
harold
samuels,
warden.
miss
thompson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
section
3243?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
see
why
that
is.
it
seems
to
me
that
just
taking
that
rather
brief
statute
on
its
face,
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
the
state
and
federal
courts
is
perfectly
consistent
with
everything
that
language
says.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
concurrent
jurisdiction,
if
a
court
has
concurrent
jurisdiction,
it
surely
has
not
been
deprived
of
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
proviso
doesn't
say,
shall
not
deprive
the
courts
of
the
united
states
of
exclusive
jurisdiction,
it
just
says
of
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
under
your
view
of
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
ms.
thompson,
what
jurisdiction
is
conferred
on
the
kansas
courts
by
virtue
of
the
first
part
of
2343--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--3243.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you
really
read
out
of
that
first
language
the
words,
to
the
same
extent
as
its
court
have
jurisdiction
over
offenses
committed
elsewhere
within
the
state
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the...
simply
the
first
paragraph
and
not
the
second
paragraph
of
3243
were
there,
would
you
still
say
that
that
could
not
be
applied
according
to
its
language
because
of
the
presumption
against
implied
repeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know,
congress
is
certainly
trying
to
effect
some
change
in
the
status
quo
with
this
legislation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
thompson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
stephan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
stephan,
whereabouts
in
kansas
is
the
kickapoo
reservation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
stephan.
mr.
kelley,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
under
her
view,
then,
or
under
the
petitioner's
view,
the
kansas
courts
would
have
gotten
no
additional
jurisdiction
under
the
first
sentence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kelley.
ms.
thompson,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
thompson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
negonsott
against
samuels.
here,
the
petitioner,
a
member
of
the
kickapoo
tribe
and
a
resident
of
the
kickapoo
reservation
in
kansas,
was
convicted
of
the
state
law
offense
of
aggravated
battery
for
shooting
another
indian
on
the
kickapoo
reservation.
he
claims
that
the
federal
government
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
to
prosecute
him
for
the
shooting
under
the
indian
major
crimes
act.
but
both,
the
supreme
court
of
kansas
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit,
ruled
against
him.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
a
law
called
the
kansas
act
confers
jurisdiction
on
the
state
to
prosecute
the
petitioner
for
aggravated
battery.
the
act's
first
sentence
which
confers
jurisdiction
on
kansas
over
offenses
committed
by
or
against
indians
on
indian
reservations
to
the
same
extent
as
its
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
offenses
committed
elsewhere
within
the
state,
unambiguously
grants
kansas
jurisdiction
to
prosecute
both
major
and
minor
offenses
committed
on
indian
reservations.
in
the
most
logical
meaning
of
the
act's
second
sentence,
which
provides
that
nothing
in
the
act
shall
deprive
federal
courts
of
their
jurisdiction
over
offenses
defined
by
the
law
of
the
united
states
is
that
federal
court
shall
retain
their
jurisdiction
to
try
federal
offenses
committed
by
or
against
indians
on
indian
reservations
in
accordance
with
the
major
crimes
act,
while
kansas
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
try
individuals
for
the
same
conduct
when
it
violates
state
law.
this
reading
is
the
only
one
that
gives
effect
to
every
word
and
clause
of
the
statute
and
it
is
supported
by
the
act's
legislative
history.
so
the
judgment
of
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
scalia
and
justice
thomas
join
all
but
part
2b
of
the
opinion,
which
is
otherwise
unanimous.
