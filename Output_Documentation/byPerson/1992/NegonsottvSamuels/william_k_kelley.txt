mr.
william
k.
kelley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
just
have
a
few
points
to
make.
first,
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
it's
quite
clear,
in
our
view,
that
the
statute
gave
kansas
complete
jurisdiction
to
prosecute
offenses
to
the
full
extent
of
state
law.
the
second
sentence
of
the
statute,
it
seems
to
us,
merely
maintained
federal
jurisdiction
where
it
existed.
it
is
not
an
implied
repeal
of
the
major
crimes
act
to
give
the
state
jurisdiction
over
a
crime
under
state
law,
because
after
the
passage
of
section
3243
and
before,
the
federal
courts
had
jurisdiction
to
entertain
major
crimes
prosecutions
under
section
1153.
now,
petitioner
has
referred
to
the
first
version
of
the
bill
and
its
inclusion
of
the
word,
concurrent,
and
the
reference
to
modification
of
the
major
crimes
act
as
indicating
that
congress
must
have
meant
something
different
in
the
final
version
of
the
bill.
in
fact,
we
think
congress
did
mean
something
different,
and
it's
fully
explained
in
the
legislative
history
what
congress
meant.
prior
to
the
passage...
excuse
me,
at
the
time
this
statute
was
under
consideration,
the
federal
government
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
so-called
minor
crimes
under
what
is
now
section
1152
between
two
indians.
the
federal
government
does
not
have
that
jurisdiction
today.
it's
quite
clear,
however,
that
under
the
kansas
act
the
state
has
jurisdiction
over
minor
crimes
between
two
indians.
moreover,
at
the
time
the
act
was
under
consideration
there
was
some
uncertainty
as
to
the
applicability
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act
in
indian
country.
that
uncertainty,
of
course,
was
removed
by
the
court's
decision
6
years
later
in
williams
v.
united
states,
but
it's
quite
clear
that
congress
meant,
by
removing
the
word,
concurrent
from
the
final
version
of
the
bill,
to
make
clear
that
kansas
had
more
jurisdiction
than
the
federal
government
had
to
that
point.
thus,
the
amendment
was
intended
to
make
the
bill
broader
rather
than
narrower
than
the
first
version.
now,
another
problem
in
petitioner's
position,
of
course,
is
that
the
modification
referred
to
in
the
first
version
of
the
bill
referred
to
what
was
then...
what
has
now
become
section
1152,
so-called
minor
crimes.
petitioner's
position
in
this
court,
however,
is
that
that's
all
the
state
was
granted
jurisdiction
over.
if
the
removal
of
the
modification
of
the
major
crimes
act
reference
in
the
version
of
the
bill
was
intended
to
retain
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
major
crimes
prosecutions,
the
same
must
be
true
of
jurisdiction
over
section
1152
prosecutions.
the
states
generally
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
minor
crimes
involving
indians
unless
congress
grants
it.
thus,
the
petitioner
can
have
it
one
way
but
not
both,
it
seems
to
us.
that
is,
under
her
view,
there
should
be
no
concurrent
jurisdiction
at
all.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well,
the
kansas
courts
would
have
gotten
jurisdiction,
mr.
chief
justice,
over
minor
crimes
between
two
indians,
because
federal
jurisdiction
did
not
exist
over
those
crimes
then,
and
it
does
not
today,
and
there's
some
question
whether
kansas
would
have
had
jurisdiction
over
assimilative
crimes
that
are
defined
by
reference
to
state
law
rather
than
general
federal
crimes
defined
by
reference
to
federal
law.
the
proviso
in
the
kansas
act
refers
to
not
depriving
federal
courts
of
jurisdiction
over
offenses
defined
by
federal
law,
and
if
assimilative
crimes
are
viewed
as
being
defined
by
reference
to
state
law,
then
an
argument
can
be
made
that
the
state
would
have
jurisdiction
over
those
offenses
as
well.
but
it's
quite
clear
that
congress
meant
to
grant
the
state
more
than
concurrent
jurisdiction.
that
is,
more
than
the
federal
courts
had.
it's
also
quite
clear,
however,
that
congress
meant
to
preserve
federal
major
crimes
jurisdiction.
that
jurisdiction
was
in
one
sense
exclusive
at
the
time.
that
is,
only
the
federal
government
could
prosecute
crimes
arising
out
of
conduct
that
was
made
criminal
under
the
offenses
enumerated
in
the
major
crimes
act.
after
passage
of
the
act,
the
state
has
that
power
as
well,
to
prosecute
under
state
law.
the
federal
jurisdiction
to
prosecute
crimes
defined
by
federal
law,
which
is
what
the
statute
says,
was
exclusive
then,
and
it
remains
exclusive
today.
with
respect
to
the
lack
of
clarity
as
to
the
consent
of
the
tribes
at
the
time,
justice
stevens,
in
response
to
your
question
earlier,
it
is
somewhat
unclear
from
history
what
the
positions
of
the
tribes
were.
as
general
stephan
mentioned,
there
was
some
question
as
to
the
legitimacy
of
the
potawatomi
business
committee
that
sent
the
letter
at
issue.
we
would
submit,
of
course,
that
the
secretary
of
interior
was
the
person
in
a
position
to
determine
which
group
spoke
for
the
tribe.
all
we
know
from
the
legislative
history
is
that
the
executive
branch
understood
the
four
tribes
to
want
the
legislation,
and
congress,
of
course,
acted
on
that
understanding,
so
to
the
extent
that
we're
trying
to
determine
the
meaning
of
what
congress
enacted,
its
understanding
of
what
the
tribes
wanted
at
the
time,
of
course,
should
be
what
counts.
now
that,
of
course,
does
not
undermine
our
position
that
the
canon
and
the
statutes
should
be
construed
liberally
in
favor
of
indians
does
not
warrant
a
different
result
here
for
at
least
two
reasons:
1)
it's
unclear
that
the
canon
urged
by
petitioner
is
in
favor
of
the
indians
generally.
of
course,
it's
in
favor
of
him,
but
the
concerns
that
animated
this
statute
were
to
protect
tribal
law
and
order
on
the
reservations
at
the
time,
and
we
submit
that
it
was
in
the
interests
of
the
indians
for
that
statute
to
be
passed
for
that
end.
moreover,
no
canon
of
construction
can
overcome
what
we
regard
as
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
and
of
course
it's
quite
plain
legislative
history.
if
the
court
has
any
further
questions...
otherwise,
i
will
submit
it.
thank
you.
