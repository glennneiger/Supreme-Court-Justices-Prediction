justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
he'll
be
eligible
for
parole
if
he
successfully
completes
sex
offender
treatment
if
you
win,
you
say.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
can't
successfully
complete
the
sex
offender
treatment,
we
are
told,
unless
he
acknowledges
his
guilt.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
a
rather
hollow
victory,
isn't
it?
he
will
be
paroled
if
he
successfully
completes
sex
offender
treatment,
which
you
acknowledge
he
cannot
possibly
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
thought
the
whole
premise
of
this
case
is
that
he
cannot
fulfill
the
conditions
imposed
upon
his
obtaining
parole,
he
cannot
fulfill
those
conditions
without
confessing
his
guilt,
without
accepting
his
guilt.
isn't
that
the
whole
premise
of
this
litigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you,
now
you
tell
us
that
that
premise
is
false,
that
he
can
indeed
complete
the
treatment
without
confessing
his
guilt.
well,
which
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
the
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
is
it
really
doesn't
matter.
he's
in
for
5
years,
whether
you
win
or
lose,
because
he
cannot
successfully
complete
his
treatment.
well,
he
might
change
his
mind.
he
might
change
his
mind.
if
you
win
the
case
he
might
decide
that
i
would
rather
get
out
in
less
than
5
years
and
admit
my
guilt.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
are
not
arguing
that
the
state...
i
thought
you
were
arguing
here
that
the
state
has
no
right
to
make
him
admit
guilt
as
a
condition
of
his
probation.
now
you
tell
us
you're
not
arguing
that.
all
you're
saying
is
that
the
state
cannot
deprive
him
of
the
opportunity
to
admit
guilt
too
soon,
that
it
has
to
leave
him
in
the
program
and
wait
the
full
5
years
and
see
if
he's
willing
to
admit
the
guilt
sometime
during
the
5
years.
but
you
acknowledge
that
the
state
can
require
him
to
admit
guilt
as
a
condition
of
his
probation?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we're
just
arguing
over
whether
it
must
require
him
to
admit
guilt
immediately
or
whether,
or
may
require
him
to
admit
it
immediately
or
whether
it
must
wait
5
years
for
him
to
admit
guilt.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
it's
a
much
less
significant
case
than
i
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
sort
of
a
use
immunity
you're
talking
about.
i
mean,
you
could
still
prosecute
him
for
perjury
but
you
couldn't
use
the
evidence
as
evidence
that
he
confessed
his
guilt
to
the
therapist.
justice
antonin
scalia
general,
do
we
have
to
agree
with
you
on
murphy?
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
that...
murphy
says
that
you
cannot
require
someone
to
admit
to
something
that
he
can
be
prosecuted
for
as
a
condition
of
retaining
his
government
job,
but
people
have
an
entitlement
to
a
government
job.
they
don't
have
an
entitlement
to
parole
unless
they
have
been
rehabilitated.
and
it
seems
to
me
if
the
state
is
saying
look,
if
you
rehabilitate
yourself
we'll
let
you
out
earlier.
now,
that
rehabilitation
may
necessitate
your
admitting
the
prior
crime.
you
can't
be
successfully
treated
unless
you
admit
it,
but
that's
your
choice.
if
you
want
to
rehabilitate
yourself
you'll
get
out
early,
if
you
don't
want
to
because
of
the
risk
of
incrimination,
well,
that's
fine
too.
i'm
not...
why
does
murphy
apply
to
that
situation
so
clearly
in
your
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
government...
okay.
okay.
may
i
ask
one
other
question
that's
prompted
by
justice
blackmun's
question?
he
made
a
first
amendment
argument
in
the
montana
supreme
court,
is
that
right?
