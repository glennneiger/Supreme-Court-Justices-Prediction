unknown
speaker
when
he
did
so
and
when
he
was
so
advised
was
he
advised
that
the
completion
of
the
program
would
require
an
admission
of
guilt?
unknown
speaker
but
even
if
you
lose
this
case
you
will
still
have
the
treatment
option
as
a
voluntary
option
which
would
hasten
the
parole
date,
so
that
you're
still
going
to
have
an
inducement
to
your
prisoners
to
engage
in
it
if
they
can
see
their
way
clear
to
admitting.
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
general
racicot.
mr.
miller,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
miller,
will
your
client
be
better
off
if
this
court
affirms
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
montana
than
he
will
be
if
it
should
reverse
it,
or
does
it
really
make
no
difference?
unknown
speaker
so
does
it,
is
it
really
of
no
moment
to
your
client
whether
the
decision
here
is
affirmed
or
reversed?
unknown
speaker
will
it
affect
him
in
any
other
way?
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
lose
this
case?
then
he,
he
will
have
the
choice,
i
suppose,
of
then
admitting
his
guilt
or
sticking
to
his
guns.
unknown
speaker
unless
he
decides
that
he's
going
to
admit
his
guilt.
unknown
speaker
because?
unknown
speaker
under
the
present,
not
because
he
has
served
the
full
term
but
because
he
is
eligible
for
parole?
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
montana
here
would
that
be
changed
in
any
way?
unknown
speaker
we
don't,
that
isn't
part
of
the
record
right
now,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you
are
telling
us
that
it
really
doesn't
matter
what
we
do
here.
he
is
going
to
get
out
after
he
finishes
phase
1
of
the
program.
unknown
speaker
has
the
prison
informed
him
of
that
because
of
the,
because
of
the
opinion
that's
on
appeal
here?
i
mean
is
the
reason
that
they
said
phase
1
is
enough
because
of
the
judgment
below?
unknown
speaker
mr.
miller,
do
you,
do
you
agree
with
the
state
that
our
opinion
in
minnesota
v.
murphy
prevents
the
state
from
using
admissions
in
this
kind
of
a
situation
for
a
perjury
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
the
only
language,
the
case
didn't
involve
that,
of
course.
what
we
found
in
the
case
was
that
he
could
have
exercised
his
fifth
amendment
right
as
far
as
appears
without
any
consequences,
that
the
state
was
not
compelling
him
to
testify.
so
the
issue
was
not
involved.
the
only
language
i
find
is
this,
the
result
may
be
different,
we
said,
the
result
may
be
different
if
the
questions
put
to
the
probationer,
however
relevant
to
his
probationary
status,
call
for
answers
that
would
incriminate
him
in
a
pending
or
later
criminal
prosecution.
there
is
thus
a
substantial
basis
in
our
cases
for
concluding
that
if
the
state
either
expressly
or,
blah,
blah,
blah.
in
other
words
even
if
we
had
said
categorically
that
the
result
would
be
different,
that
would
still
have
been
dictum,
but
we
didn't
even
say
it
categorically.
we
just
said
the
result
may
be
different,
and
there's
a
substantial
basis
for
making
such
an
argument.
now
maybe
there
is,
but
it
seems
to
me
a
pretty
bad
argument.
why
can't
the
state
put
you
to
your
choice?
if
you
want
to
be
treated
you
admit
your
guilt
and
maybe
you
have
to
take
your
chance
on
a
perjury
prosecution.
on
the
other
hand
if
you
don't
want
to
do
that
you
can't
be
treated,
and
since
you
can't
be
treated
you're
going
to
be
a
dangerous
person
and
we're
going
to
keep
you
here
for
5
years.
why
isn't
that
perfectly
reasonable?
unknown
speaker
about
the
prior
crime?
you're
talking
about
statements
about
the
prior
crime?
unknown
speaker
so
that
he
could
be,
he
couldn't
be
prosecuted
for
the
prior
crime
again
but
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
perjury
at
the
prior
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
think
that
murphy
would
prevent
that?
unknown
speaker
but
murphy
is
a
federal
constitutional
decision
and
that
provision
would
presumably
have
to
yield
to
murphy
if
indeed
murphy
clearly
holds
that
you
can't
do
that.
now
i
don't
think
it
clearly
holds
that.
i'm
sure
it
doesn't
clearly,
i'm
sure
it
doesn't
hold
it.
i
don't
even
think
it
clearly
says
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
miller,
let
me
change
the
facts
slightly.
let's
assume
your
client
had
been
convicted
and
he
was
brought
on
for
sentencing
and
the
judge
had
engaged
in
this
colloquy
with
him.
the
judge
had
said
basically
i
have
two
options.
i
can
commit
you
to
prison
for
5
years
or
if
certain
conditions
precedent
are
fulfilled
i
can
place
you
on
probation
so
that
you
can
undergo
therapy.
one
of
the
conditions
of
undergoing
therapy
is
that
you
must
admit
that
there
is
something
for
which
you
need
the
therapy
and
you
must
admit
your
guilt
in
other
words
in
order
to
go
through
the
therapy
program.
your
client
said
i'll
take
the
therapy
program,
your
honor,
and
your
client
then
later
on,
just
as
he
has
in
this
case,
refused
to
admit
his
guilt.
would
he
have
a
fifth
amendment
claim?
unknown
speaker
why
is...
i'm
sorry.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
he
basically
in
the
same
position
now
the
colloquy
is
simply
delayed?
somebody
has
made
a
mistake,
he
didn't
realize
he
had
to
admit
it,
the
court
didn't
think
to
ask
him.
why
isn't
he
in
the
same
position
now
except
that
we're
doing
it
somewhat
down
the
road
from
the
moment
of
sentencing?
unknown
speaker
i
know,
but
the
court's
giving
him
that
choice
now.
unknown
speaker
the
court
is
giving
him
the
choice
now.
he
said
you
can
either
participate
in
the
treatment
program
or
you're
going
to
have
to
serve
time.
he
is
giving
him
the
same
choice
that
he
would
have
given
him
in
the
first
place.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
the
failure
of
the
court
to
give
him
that
choice
in
effect
gave
rise
to
a
liberty
interest
which
cannot
be
defeated
at
this
point
in
the
same
fashion
that
it
could
have
been
avoided
in
the
first
instance.
is
that
the
nub
of
it?
unknown
speaker
why
is
his
choice
not
free?
i
mean,
it's
a
hard
choice.
he's
saying
to
himself
if
i
admit
it
i
may
be
subject
to
a
perjury
prosecution,
if
i
don't
admit
it
it's
going
to
be
5
years.
that's
exactly
the
same
choice
he
would
have
had
in
the
first
place--
unknown
speaker
--well,
why
does
he
have
any
more
choice,
mr.
miller,
under
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
montana
where
they
say
you
can't
force
him
to
be
on
this
treatment
program
because
he
doesn't
want
to
admit
his
guilt
and
we
won't
force
him
to,
but
if
he
doesn't
he
goes
to
jail
for
5
years
i
mean,
isn't
that
just
as
much
of
a
penalty
under
the
supreme
court's
decision?
unknown
speaker
he
can
maintain
his
innocence
while
spending
5
years
in
jail.
unknown
speaker
and
why
isn't
it
very
similar
to
the
ordinary
plea
bargain
case
where
someone
has
a
choice
of
admitting
guilt
and
accepting
the
conditions
of
the
plea
bargain
or
foregoing
it
and
taking
his
chances?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
the
wrong
of
which
you
complain
is
not
that
he
is
compelled
to
make
a
choice.
the
wrong
of
which
you
complain,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
he
was
just
not
advised
up
front
of
what
that
choice
would
be.
unknown
speaker
what
would
he
have
done
differently,
do
you
think,
if
he
had
been
advised
at
the
very
beginning
of
this
choice?
unknown
speaker
which
is
what
he
has
done
anyway.
unknown
speaker
mr.
miller,
may
i
just
ask,
as
i
understand
it
the,
after
he
was
sentenced,
the
third
order
of
sentencings,
he
has
challenged
that
with
a
petition
for
habeas
corpus
in
the
montana
supreme
court
appearing
pro
se,
according
to
your
opponent's
brief.
has
that
case
been
disposed
of
yet
in
the
montana
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
and
what
happened?
unknown
speaker
it
was
rejected?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
which,
just
to
take
that
one
step
farther,
which
means
apparently
the
montana
supreme
court
was
satisfied
with
the
fact
that
he
had
to
go
to
jail
for
5
years
even
though,
when
he
wouldn't
admit
his
guilt.
unknown
speaker
it
would
also
send
a
message
that,
1
would
think,
that
if
the
state
doesn't
change
its
sex
offender
program
those
who
can't
get
in
it
because
of
their
unwillingness
to
admit
guilt
will
simply
go
to
prison
instead,
which
is
what
happened
here.
unknown
speaker
what
are
you
asking
of
us,
mr.
miller?
what
do
you
want,
what
do
you
want
states
to
do?
let's
assume
that
states
believe
and
that
medical
testimony
demonstrates
that
you
cannot
have
successful
treatment
without
acknowledgement
of
guilt.
now,
i
have
heard
that,
i
don't,
i'm
not
a
psychiatrist,
but
i
have
certainly
heard
that
said
often
that
the
first
step
is
acknowledgement
of
your,
of
the
problem.
now
suppose
that
that
is
true.
what
would
you
have
the
state
do?
despite
the
fact
that
you
can't
be
successfully
treated,
let
you
out
before
the
5
years?
unknown
speaker
you
just
want
him
in
the
program,
you
don't
care
whether
he
gets
out
of
prison
early
or
not?
unknown
speaker
so,
i
see.
this
case
is
about
whether
he
gets
into
the
program,
not
about
whether
he
gets
out
of
prison
early,
not
about
whether
he
gets
his
probation?
just
about
whether
he
gets
in
the
treatment
program
without
being
willing
to
confess
his
guilt.
unknown
speaker
okay.
you
don't
want
us
to
say
that
anybody
has
to
be
released
early
despite
his
unwillingness
to
admit
guilt?
you
don't...
that's
not
the
proposition?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
whether
the
prison
would
take
this
view
if
we
reverse.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
according
to
the
information,
but
you
don't
know
why
they
said
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
you
think
that's
the
general
rule
in
the
prison?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
are
they
saying
it
to
him?
maybe
because
he
won
his
case
in
the
supreme
court
of
montana.
unknown
speaker
anyway
that
isn't
part
of
the
record.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
general
racicot,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask,
is
the
sentencing
order
that's
now
operative,
is
that
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
me,
it's
not
in
the
printed
appendix
but
it's
in
the
record,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
but
we
were
told
that
the
prison
has
informed
mr.
imlay
that
he's
about
to
be
released.
is
that
in
the
record?
