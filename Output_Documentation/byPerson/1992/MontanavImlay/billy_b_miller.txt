mr.
billy
b.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
come
before
this
court
today
seeking
affirmation
of
the
montana
state
supreme
court's
decision
in
this
case.
the
justification
of
the
montana
state
supreme
court's
decision
is
based
on
the
proposition
that
mr.
imlay's
fifth
amendment
right
against
self-incrimination
was
violated
when
the
trial
court
revoked
his
probationary
sentence
because
of
his
refusal
to
admit
guilt
in
order
to
participate
in
the
sex
offender
therapy
program.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
well,
your
honor,
at
this
point
if
it's
affirmed
he
will
not
be
required
to
participate
in
the
program,
but
he
has
been
imprisoned
for
such
an
extended
period
of
time
that
actually
he
would
serve
his
time.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
well,
my
client
is
obviously
concerned
about
the
decision,
but
it
will
not
affect
the
time
that
he
will
spend
in
prison.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
it
will
not
affect
him
in
another
way,
your
honor.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
well,
if
my
client,
if
this
case,
the
court
finds
that
this
case
is
not,
should
not
be
upheld,
then
basically
my
client
would
be
in
the
position
whereby,
as
i
stated,
he
would
have
spent
his
time
in
prison
and
at
this
point
it
will
not--
mr.
billy
b.
miller
--well,
he
would
be
able
to
be
released
from
prison
in
a
very
short
period
of
time
regardless.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
well,
because
in
the
state
prison
they
have
two
phases
of
the
sexual
offender
program.
they
have
phase
1,
where
an
individual
can
participate
and
does
not
have
to
admit
his
guilt.
once
he
has
completed
that
phase
then
there
is
the
second
phase
whereby
the
individual
will
have
to
admit
guilt
prior
to
being
admitted
into
that
phase.
my
client
has
received
notification
from
the
prison
that
once
he
finishes
the
first
phase
they
will
parole
him.
so
at
this
point
he
has
participated
in
the
first
phase
of
the
program
and
hopefully
he
will
be
released
in
the
near
future.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
because
he
would
be
eligible
for
parole,
yes.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
i
can't
see
where
that
will
affect
it
at
all
at
this
point
because
of
the
fact
that
he
will
have
finished
the
first
phase
of
the
program,
and
that
is
basically
what
he
has
been
promised
as
a
result
of
finishing
the
first
phase,
his
being
placed
on
parole.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
that's
just
information
regarding
the
program.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
well,
that
is
what
the
prison
has
informed
my
client.
now,
as
to
whether
he
will
actually
be
released
i
cannot
assure
this
court
that
that
is
the
case.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
your
honor,
in
speak
with
my
client
in
reference
to
that
particular
subject,
he
was
participating
in
phase
1
of
the
program
and
once
the
supreme
court
made
its
decision
and
he
was
sent
back
to
prison
he
was
only
able
to
participate
in
the
phase
1
program
for
a
period
of
time
and
they
kicked
him
out
of
the
program.
they
have
since
notified
him
to
enroll
back
into
the
program
and
complete
the
program
and
they
will
release
him
from
prison.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
yes,
your
honor,
i
will
agree
with
that.
in
fact
in
minnesota
v.
murphy
it
is
clear
that
if
a
person
uses
statement
that
will
incriminate
him,
then
he
has
to
have
immunity.
the
state
cannot
either
expressly
or
indirectly
force
a
probationer
to
admit
an
incriminating
statement.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
well,
one
of
the
arguments
that
we
raised
in
our
brief
is
the
fact
that
mr.
imlay
could
be
charged
in
the
future
with
perjury
if
he
admitted
his
guilt
in
order
to
participate
in
a
sex
offender
therapy
program.
and
i
think
as
a
result
of
the
decision
in
the
state
of
montana
in
reference
to
the
drummond
case
that
i
cited
in
my
supplemental
brief
it
shows
that
an
admission
by
mr.
imlay
would
tend
to
incriminate
him.
in
fact
the
drummond
case
where
the
defendant
was
accused
and
was
convicted,
at
least
he
pled
guilty
to
sexual
intercourse
without
consent,
and
he
was
sentenced
to
the
montana
state
prison.
in
that
particular
case
one
of
the
conditions
placed
on
him
was
he
was
required
to
participate
in
a
sex
offender
therapy
program.
in
participating
in
the
program
he
admitted
certain
criminal
acts
that
he
had
done
prior
to
being
incarcerated.
he
was
compelled
to
admit
these
acts
because
of
the
fact
that
in
a
sex
offender
therapy
program
you
are
required
to
permit
prior
criminal
acts
and
you
are
basically
in
a
position
whereby
you
can
either
be
prosecuted
for
those
acts
or
you
will
have
immunity
for
those
acts.
it
depends
on
the
victim.
now,
the
state
of
montana
has
made
it
clear
in
the
montana
code
annotated
that
where
there's
a
child
involved
a
professional
must
notify
the
department
of
family
services
of
any
information
he
receives
during
his
professional
duties
that
will
show
that
the
child
has
been
neglected
or
abused.
that
information
will
also
be
reported
to
the
state,
and
in
turn
the
state
can
file
charges
against
a
particular
individual
while
participating
in
the
program.
and
this
is
what
the
drummond
case
is
all
about.
drummond
was
participating
in
a
treatment
program
and
it
showed
that
the
state
was
willing
to
take
the
statement
that
he
made
to
his
therapist
during
treatment
and
notify
the
department
of
family
services.
and
consequently
he
was
found
guilty
or
he
pled
guilty
to
incest,
and
now
he's
awaiting
sentencing.
so
basically
there
is
an
exception
to
whether
you
are
granted
immunity
when
you
participate
in
the
sex
offender
therapy
program.
and
it's
clear
pursuant
to
the
montana
code
annotated
in
reference
to
that
area.
so
basically
that
is
the
reason
why
mr.
imlay
could
have
been
under
the
threat
of
perjury
because
of
the
fact
that
the
therapist
would
have
been
able
to
testify
in
reference
to
any
statements
made
to
him,
not
only
the
fact
that
mr.
imlay
would
have
to
make
a
statement
to
the
therapist
but
he
would
also
have
had
to
sign
a
contract.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
about
the
prior
crime.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
exactly.
he
could,
utilizing
the
testimony
he
gave
at
trial,
any
statements
that
he
would
make
to
his
therapist
and
additional
members
of
the
program
could
be
utilized
against
him
to
charge
him
with
perjury
for
the
statement
that
he
made
at
trial.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
well,
at
this
point
i
don't
think
murphy
will
prevent
it
because
of
the
fact
that
the
state,
as
i
stated
earlier,
has
this
provision
in
reference
to
individuals
who
are
participating
in
the
sex
offender
therapy
program
and
that
a
child
is
the
victim.
so
there's
the
exception
that
montana
has
in
its
code
section
that
would
provide
that
the
therapist
would
be
able
to
reveal
this
information.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
i
feel
that
murphy
is
sufficient
to
address
that
particular
issue
if
the
exception
in
the
code
section
was
not
available.
the
exception
in
the
code
section
is
the
one
that
permits
the
state
of
montana
to
prosecute
for
any
statements
made
during
treatment
if
the
victim
is
a
child,
and
i
think
that's
what
happened
in
drummond.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
under
that
particular
example
i
would
venture
to
say
that
he
would
not,
because
he
would
have
waived
it
by
way
of
accepting
the
program
at
the
time
that
the
court
offered
him
an
option.
in
other
words
he
would
have
been
in
a
position
whereby
he
could
accept
the
program,
and
since
he
agreed
to
accept
the
program
he
would
be
in
a
position
to
participate
in
the
program.
so
he
would
have
to
admit--
mr.
billy
b.
miller
--excuse
me.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
well,
because
at
that
time
the
court
did
not
give
him
that
choice.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
in
placing
him
in
the
position
whereby
he
would
have
to
admit
his
guilt
in
order
to
participate
in
the
program
and
he
did
not
have
a
choice
or
free
choice
to
admit
or
deny--
mr.
billy
b.
miller
--but
in
your
example
he
has
a
free
choice.
at
the
sentencing
process
he
did
not
have
a
free
choice.
the
judge
placed
him
on
a
probationary
sentence
and
one
of
the
conditions
was
that
he
participate
in
the
program.
there
was
no
choice
involved
at
all
at
that
point.
so
he
did
not
have
a
free
choice.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
if
the
court
had
notified
him
basically
the
position
of
the
program
and
basically
that
he
would
be
required
to
admit
his
guilt
and
he
had
an
option
at
that
point,
he
would
be
able
to
make
a
free
choice.
he
was
not
in
the
position
to
make
a
free
choice.
it
is
clear
that
by
his
conduct--
mr.
billy
b.
miller
--well,
he
is
obviously
placed
in
a
catch-22
situation
whereby
he
would
be
required
to
either
admit
the
offense
and
serve,
and
basically
have
a
perjury
charge
brought
against
him,
or
deny
it
as
is
stated
and
go
to
prison.
and
i
don't
think
that
is
a
choice
at
all,
if
you
are
taking
the
situation
whereby
you
are
placing
an
individual
where
both
ways
he
would
lose.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
to
a
degree,
your
honor,
i
would
venture
to
say
it
is
a
penalty,
but
we
must
look
at
the
fact
that
he
is
not,
he
does
not
lose
the
right
to
maintain
his
innocence
simply
because
he
was
found
guilty.
he
still
can
maintain
his
innocence.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
well,
that
is
the
option
he
obviously
selected
to
this
point
because
he
is
currently
incarcerated.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
well,
it's
different
from
a
plea
bargaining
because
during
plea
negotiation
the
defendant
has
an
opportunity
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
he
is
going
to
give
up
a
certain
right
or
benefit,
i.e.
that
he
is
going
to
accept
a
bargain
from
the
state
for
his
guilty
plea.
and
that
is
basically
a
contract
negotiation.
once
he
has
entered
that
particular
contract
with
the
state
then
he
would
have
to
admit
his
guilt
to
the
court
in
order
for
the
court
to
accept
the
plea
bargaining.
so
at
that
point
he
does
not
lose
anything
once
he
has
gotten
his
agreement
through
the
plea
agreement
because
he
would
have
to
admit
his
guilt
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
that
is
in
the
plea
agreement.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
well,
he
was
not
advised
to
the
point
that
when
he
attempted
to
enroll
in
the
sex
offender
therapy
program
he
maintained
his
innocence
under
the
impression
that
he
would
be
able
to
participate
in
the
program
and
he
continued
to
maintain
his
innocence.
he
did
everything
that
was
required
of
him
in
order
to
participate
in
the
program.
he
made
all
the
appointments
and
he
was
very
cooperative.
unfortunately
his
therapist
indicated
that
he
could
not
be
accepted
in
the
program
because
of
the
fact
that
he
did
not
admit
his
guilt,
so
he
was
in
denial.
but
at
this
point
he
attempted
to
do
everything
necessary
to
obtain
admission
into
the
program,
except
admit
his
guilt.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
well,
i
would
be
speculating
at
this
point
because
i
am
not
privy
as
to
what
decision
he
would
ultimately
make
in
this
position,
but
i
would
venture
to
say
that
he
would
maintain
his
innocence.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
yes,
your
honor,
that
case
has
been
disposed
of
in
the--
mr.
billy
b.
miller
--well,
it
was
dismissed.
it
was
rejected.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
state
argues
that
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
to
compel
mr.
imlay
to
admit
his
guilt
for
the
purpose
of
having
him
accept
responsibility
for
the
crime
for
which
he
had
been
convicted.
now
although
this
court
has
confirmed
the
position
taken
by
the
state
regarding
the
acceptance
of
responsibility,
this
court
also
made
it
clear
that
before
a
defendant
could
be
compelled
to
accept
responsibility
whereby
he
would
have
to
make
an
incriminating
statement
he
should
be
granted
immunity.
however,
in
this
case
with
mr.
imlay
immunity
would
not
have
been
appropriate
under
the
circumstances
because
immunity
is
not
a
protection
for
a
charge
of
perjury.
mr.
imlay
would
have
been
required
to
make
an
inconsistent
statement
in
order
to
participate
in
the
program.
so
by
changing
his
statement
from
the
original
ones
he
made
at
trial
he
would
have
committed
perjury
and
therefore
any
immunity
that
would
be
granted
to
a
person
participating
in
the
sex
offender
program
would
not
be
applicable
in
his
case.
this
dilemma
that
mr.
imlay
was
facing
at
the
time
he
attempted
to
enroll
in
the
sex
offender
therapy
program
is
identical
to
that
which
the
sex
offender
was
facing
in
gilfillen
v.
state
of
indiana.
now,
in
that
case
the
court
stated
that
where
a
defendant
has
not
pled
guilty,
but
rather
he
has
been
found
guilty
while
maintaining
his
innocence,
the
court
cannot
force
him
to
admit
his
guilt
as
a
condition
of
probation,
nor
can
the
court
revoke
a
probationary
sentence
because
he
will
not
admit
his
guilt.
despite
the
obvious
violation
of
mr.
imlay's
fifth
amendment
right
against
self-incrimination,
the
state
court
is
requesting
that
this
court
should
disregard
the
blatant
constitutional
violation
in
the
interest
of
promoting
rehabilitation.
now,
mr.
imlay
concedes
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
rehabilitative
interest
in
requiring
that
sex
offenders
participate
in
a
program.
however,
since
denial
is
the
type
of
behavior
common
to
individuals
convicted
of
sexual
offenses,
it
seems
paradoxical
to
classify
an
individual
as
a
sex
offender,
place
that
individual
on
probation,
and
then
revoke
his
probationary
sentence
simply
because
he
exhibits
the
behavior
common
to
sex
offenders.
the
parties
who
submitted
amicus
brief
on
behalf
of
the
state
express
concern
that
if
this
court
upholds
the
montana
state
supreme
court
decision
in
this
case
it
will
have
an
adverse
effect
on
the
rehabilitation
process.
while
their
position
is
understandable,
their
logic
is
faulty.
should
this
court
uphold
the
decision
of
the
montana
state
supreme
court
such
a
decision
would
send
a
clear
message
to
all
sex
offender
programs
that
society
demands
treatment
for
all
sex
offenders,
not
just
for
a
few,
not
just
for
the
ones
who
will
admit
their
guilt
but
for
all
sex
offenders.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
yes,
and
i
would
like
to
add
to
that
that
they
would
go
to
prison
and
they
will
come
back
out
of
prison
in
the
communities
to
re-offend,
at
least
that
is
the
concern
of
society
is
that
being
that
they
are
not
receiving
treatment
they
are
not
benefitting
from
the
incarceration.
so
to
be
inclusive
a
treatment
plan
would
take
care
of
the
problem
of
having
individuals
incarcerated
just
for
the
purpose
of
incarceration
and
being
returned
to
the
community
to
re-offend.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
i
feel
that
the
program
should
be
basically
structured
the
same
way
that
you
have
the
alcohol
anonymous
program
set
up,
where
a
person
can
participate
regardless
of
whether
he
is
going
to
admit
or
not.
he
needs
to
be
in
a
program
if
the
individual
has
a
problem.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
my
client,
in
fact
my
client
will
be
getting
out
of
prison
in
a
very
short
period
of
time.
i
thought
i
made
that
clear
earlier.
so
as
far
as
my
client
is
concerned,
but
as
far
as
the
program
is
concerned
in
general
the
program
has
to
be
inclusive
in
order
to
take
into
consideration
all
types
of
individuals
who
are
considered
sex
abusers.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
well,
as
i
explained
earlier,
my
client
will
be
getting
out
of
prison
in
a
very
short
period
of
time
according
to
the
information
he
has
received
from
the
prison.
so
basically
he
will
be
getting
out
of
prison
in
a
very
short
period
of
time.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
that's
not
my
position
at
this
point.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
well,
basically
as
far
as
my
client
is
concerned
he
will
be
getting
out
of
prison
in
the
very
near
future
according
to
the
information
i
have
received
from
him.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
they
informed
him
basically
about
the
first
stage.
once
he
completes
the
first
stage--
mr.
billy
b.
miller
--i
don't
think
that's
the
general
rule.
i
think
that's
an
exception
to
him.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
well,
a
lot
of
things
have
happened
to
him
since
the
decision
from
the
montana
supreme
court
while
he
was
in
prison.
mr.
billy
b.
miller
in
closing
it
is
clear
that
donald
imlay's
fifth
amendment
right
against
self-incrimination
was
violated
when
his
probationary
sentence
was
revoked
because
of
his
refusal
to
admit
guilt
in
order
to
enroll
and
participate
in
a
therapy
program.
clearly
the
sex
offender
therapy
program
must
be
inclusive
in
order
to
accomplish
its
rehabilitative
objective.
therefore
we
are
requesting
that
this
court
confirm
the
montana
state
supreme
court
decision
in
this
case.
thank
you.
