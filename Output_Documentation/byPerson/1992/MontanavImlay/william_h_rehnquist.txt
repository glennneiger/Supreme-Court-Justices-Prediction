racicot?
racicot.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
question
i
just
asked,
i
guess,
was
whether
you
could
prosecute
the
defendant
for
perjury.
i
guess
it's
agreed,
is
it
not,
that
statements
made
to
a
therapist
are
not
under
oath
and
so
there
could
be
no
perjury
prosecution
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
where
would
the
possible
perjury
prosecution
come
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
i
see.
on
the
basis
of
that
testimony
in
the
later
statement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
racicot.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
91-687,
montana
against
imlay.
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
justice
stevens

the
concurring
opinion;
justice
white

the
dissenting
