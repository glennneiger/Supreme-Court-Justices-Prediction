justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
was...
the
briefs
were
not
clear
as
to
whether
or
not
the
statements
are
privileged.
i
have
taken
the
case
as
if
there
is
no
privilege
for
the,
against
the
disclosure
of
this
information
by
the
therapist.
is
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
then
we
simply
rely
on
the
proffers
of
good
faith
by
the
state
that
this
information
will
not
be
divulged?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it
was
the
policy
of
the
therapist
routinely
to
report
all
admissions
of
crimes
by
patients
under
their
treatment
to
the
prosecutor's
office.
would
the
result
of
the
case
be
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
your
case
of
state
v.
thiel?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
did
not
read
the
case
that
way.
do
you
have
any
other
montana
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
submission
to
us
is
that
these
statements
are
in
effect
compelled
by
the
state
at
least
for
purposes
of
future
prosecutions,
and
so
he
has
an
immunity
from
the
use
of
these
statements?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
concede
that
he
has
immunity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
just
want
to
reiterate.
thiel
was
a
case
in
which
the
court
said
he
has
been
sentenced
under
a
plea
bargain
for
the
acts
in
question,
and
therefore
double
jeopardy
bars
his
reprosecution
for
those
crimes.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
self-incrimination
clause
in
my
view.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
still
must
confess
puzzlement.
your
brief
says
that
these
are
not
statements
that
are
covered
by
the
fifth
amendment
because
there's
no
possibility
of
incrimination.
and
then
you
have
told
us
the
reason
there's
no
possibility
of
incrimination
is
because
they're
immunized.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
accept
one
theory
of
the
case
or
the
other.
either
the
fifth
amendment
is
applicable
or
it
is
not.
