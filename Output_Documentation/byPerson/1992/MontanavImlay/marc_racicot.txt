mr.
marc
racicot
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
56-year
old
defendant
in
this
case
was
convicted
of
the
sexual
assault
of
a
7-year
old
girl
in
a
grocery
store.
at
trial
he
testified
and
denied
ever
sexually
assaulting
the
victim.
he
was
sentenced
to
5
years
in
montana
state
prison,
which
was
suspended
on
several
conditions,
one
of
which
was
that
he
would
enroll
and
complete
a
sex
offender
treatment
program.
the
defendant
did
in
fact
enroll
in
such
a
program--
mr.
marc
racicot
--no,
your
honor,
he
was
not.
he
did
enroll
in
such
a
program
but
did
not
complete
it.
he
was
terminated
from
the
program
because
he
would
not
admit
his
guilt
to
the
offense
charged.
as
a
result
the
district
court
revoked
probation
and
remanded
the
defendant
to
the
montana
state
prison
where
inpatient
sex
offender
treatment
was
available.
subsequently
the
montara
supreme
court
vacated
that
sentence
and
remanded
back
to
the
district
court,
where
the
defendant
was
sentenced
to
5
years
at
montana
state
prison
with
no
condition
for
treatment.
and
that
is
where
the
defendant
presently
resides.
the
issue
is
whether
revocation
of
probation,
or
failure
to
complete
a
sex
offender
treatment
program
because
the
defendant
would
not
accept
responsibility
for
the
offense
of
which
he
was
convicted,
violates
the
defendant's
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
marc
racicot
justice
stevens,
he
was
then,
had
his
suspension,
his
probation
revoked
and
was
committed
to
the
montana
state
prison
for
5
years.
mr.
marc
racicot
no,
sir,
not
precisely.
if
we
win
this
case
then
the
defendant
inside,
then
the
sentence
of
the
montana
supreme
court
ordering,
ordered
from
the
district
court
will
be
revoked
or
reversed
and
then
the
defendant
will
be
subject
to
the
sentence
previously
imposed
which
was
that
he
could
not
be
paroled
until
such
time
as
he
had
completed
sex
offender
treatment.
mr.
marc
racicot
well,
he
does
not
necessarily.
under
the
one
circumstance,
with
the
sentence
reimposed
by
the
district
court
after
the
initial
revocation,
he
would
be,
with
the
recommendation
of
the
court,
subjected
to
sex
offender
treatment.
upon
successful
completion
would
then
be
eligible
for
parole.
that
was
the
recommendation
of
the
district
court.
mr.
marc
racicot
if
we
win.
mr.
marc
racicot
yes,
sir,
we
are.
mr.
marc
racicot
in
our
judgment
that
is
certainly
the
case.
mr.
marc
racicot
yes.
mr.
marc
racicot
that
is
true
as
well.
mr.
marc
racicot
well,
the
dynamics,
justice
scalia,
are
in
our
experience
that
in
fact
inpatient
sex
offender
treatment,
when
it
is
available,
through
the
course
of
that
there
is
a
very
high
likelihood
that
he
will
successfully
complete.
inpatient
status
and
being
subjected
to
the
treatment
over
the
course
of
that
time
in
our
experience
has
indicated
successful
results.
mr.
marc
racicot
it
is.
mr.
marc
racicot
he
cannot
successfully
complete
the
treatment
without
confessing
his
guilt.
he
refuses
to
do
that
at
the
present
time.
mr.
marc
racicot
that
is
precisely--
mr.
marc
racicot
--there
certainly
would
be
an
educational,
there
are
two
parts
to
the
course
that
is
offered.
mr.
marc
racicot
we
would,
the
course
will
still
be
available.
there
are
two
parts.
one
requires
an
admission,
one
does
not.
one
is
an
educational
portion,
and
when
it's
provided
in
an
inpatient
setting
it
has
been
our
experience
with
even
those
who
do
not
choose
to
admit
at
the
beginning,
overwhelmingly
you
have
a
chance
of
success
throughout
the
course
of
that
process.
mr.
marc
racicot
if,
justice
white,
the--
mr.
marc
racicot
--yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
racicot
yes,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
marc
racicot
in
essence,
yes.
mr.
marc
racicot
one
thing
to
keep
in
mind,
i'm
hopeful
that
the
court
will
throughout
the
course
of
consideration,
is
that
the
admission
of
guilt
that
was
sought
was
solely
for
treatment
purposes
and
rehabilitation
purposes,
and
the
record
indicates
that.
it
is
unequivocally
clear.
there
was
no
intent
at
any
point
in
time
to
elicit
incriminating
statements
to
be
used
in
a
future
prosecution.
mr.
marc
racicot
yes,
justice
kennedy,
that's
our
position.
this
court
has
made
it
clear
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
prosecution--
mr.
marc
racicot
--i
believe
there
are
other,
there
are
other
safeguards
that
are,
already
have
been
announced
by
this
court
as
well
as
by
the
montana
supreme
court.
as
well,
in
our
judgment
there
is
not
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
future
criminal
prosecution
in
this
kind
of
a
case
as
a
result
of
those
proscriptions
as
well
as
a
result
of
our
intent
to
provide
treatment.
mr.
marc
racicot
no,
sir,
it
would
not.
because
even
with
that
report
there
is
still
by
montana
supreme
court
rule
an
inability
to
use
those
admissions
in
a
future
prosecution.
as
well
i
believe
this
court
has
held
the
same
in--
mr.
marc
racicot
--thiel.
yes,
sir.
mr.
marc
racicot
not
montana
authority,
but
this
court
in
murphy
in
our
judgment
certainly
holds
that
any
future
prosecution
based
upon
uncharged
acts
would
be
prohibited
in
this
kind
of
a
circumstance.
mr.
marc
racicot
no,
we
would
not
say
that
that
was
our
intent.
there
certainly
could
be,
even
if
there
was,
even
if
it
was
stipulated
that
there
is
compulsion
by
rule
of
this
court,
and
the
rule
of
the
land,
the
law
of
the
land
is
that
they
could
not
be
used
in
a
future
prosecution.
mr.
marc
racicot
well,
that's
certainly
something
that
could
have
been
done.
mr.
marc
racicot
because
the
issue
was
not
raised
in
that
context.
and
frankly
with
the
prohibition
against
utilizing
it
in
a
future
prosecution
my
expectation
is
that
it
was
not
deemed
necessary
at
that
point
in
time,
nor
requested.
mr.
marc
racicot
yes.
mr.
marc
racicot
yes.
this
court
has
made
it
clear--
mr.
marc
racicot
--no,
because
the
statement
is
not
made
under
oath
in
the
state
of
montana.
mr.
marc
racicot
i
might
point
out
that
he
would
be
subject
to
a
prosecution
for
perjury
regardless
of
whether
or
not
this
kind
of
a
statement
was
requested
or
demanded.
he
could
still
have
been
subjected
to
a
perjury
prosecution
based
upon
the
evidence
that
was
available
absent
any
admission.
mr.
marc
racicot
yes,
that
is
our
position.
mr.
marc
racicot
yes.
mr.
marc
racicot
that
is
our
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
marc
racicot
that's
correct,
in
the
state
of
montana.
mr.
marc
racicot
there
are...
you
could
go
back
and
because
of
his
denial
at
trial
and
his
testimony
at
trial
charge
perjury
and
reinstitute
a
prosecution
based
on
the
evidence.
mr.
marc
racicot
yes.
the
court
has
made
it
clear
that
the
constitution
does
not
forbid
every
government
imposed
choice
in
the
criminal
process
that
has
the
effect
of
discouraging
the
exercise
of
constitutional
rights
instance
in
the
area
of
disclosure
of
alibi
witnesses
the
use
of
pre-arrest
assertion
of
the
privilege
to
impeach
a
trial.
the
availability
of
a
constitutional
protection
does
not
mean
automatically
that
a
defendant
cannot
in
some
instances
be
required
to
make
a
choice
when
to
rely
upon
it,
for
instance
in
plea
bargaining
situations.
in
that
situation
a
defendant
is
presented
with
a
choice
of
giving
up
not
only
his
right
against
self-incrimination
but
also
his
or
her
right
to
a
trial
including
the
right
to
confront
witnesses,
in
exchange
for
a
more
lenient
sentence.
there
is
much
more
of
an
onerous
burden
on
the
exercise
of
constitutional
rights
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
than
there
is
here.
the
defendant
in
that
situation
is
told
in
no
uncertain
terms
before
there
is
even
a
finding
of
guilt
that
he
or
she
will
suffer
much
harsher
consequences
in
the
event
that
he
or
she
chooses
to
exercise
the
constitutional
rights
that
are
clearly
guaranteed
by
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments.
the
defendant
here
was
not
subjected
to
proscribed
compulsion
in
an
effort
to
force
him
to
waive
his
fifth
amendment
rights.
he
was
offered
an
opportunity
to
obtain
leniency,
namely
continued
probation.
it
was
his
choice.
imlay's
failure
to
accept
responsibility
did
lead
to
the
revocation
of
his
probation,
but
his
prison
sentence
was
imposed
in
the
first
place
because
he
sexually
molested
a
7-year
old
girl,
and
not
because
he
refused
to
admit
his
guilt.
he
wasn't
ordered
to
confess,
or
required
to
make
incriminating
statements
under
oath,
or
held
in
contempt,
or
sentenced
to
an
additional
prison
term
because
of
his
silence.
he
simply
made
a
decision
not
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
his
probation,
and
as
a
result
he
was
denied
that
status,
namely
probation.
mr.
marc
racicot
the
third
order
by
the
district
court--
mr.
marc
racicot
--sentenced
to
5
years
without
a
condition
that
he
go
through
sex
offender
treatment
before
being
eligible
for
parole.
mr.
marc
racicot
absent
the
parole
board's
involvement,
yes,
justice
stevens,
that
would
be
the
case.
but
they
do
have
a
requirement
that
prior
to
the
time
you're
eligible
for
parole
that
you
do
go
through
the
sex
offender
treatment.
mr.
marc
racicot
i
think
that's
the
practical
effect,
yes.
mr.
marc
racicot
it
makes
a
huge
difference
in
terms
of
not
only
this
case
but
other
cases--
mr.
marc
racicot
--well,
if
the
question,
justice
stevens,
is
whether
or
not
the
case
is
moot
as
a
result
of
what
has
occurred
here--
mr.
marc
racicot
--i
believe
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
indicate
that
there
are
in
fact,
that
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
because
the
state
is
not
able
to
impose
the
collateral
consequences
of
the
defendant's
conviction,
namely
that
he
be
compelled
to
go
through
sex
offender
treatment.
mr.
marc
racicot
i
also
believe--
mr.
marc
racicot
--but
i
also
believe
that
this
court
has
indicated
that
the
resentencing
in
a
case
like
this
is
merely
the
obedience
of
a
court's
order,
and
that
that
does
not
by
itself
end
up
alleviating
the
possibility
that
the
case
is
in
fact
a
case
or
controversy.
mr.
marc
racicot
i
understand
as
well.
there
was
never
any
intent
in
this
case
to
compel
imlay
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
in
a
criminal
case.
as
this
court
noted
in
allen
v.
illinois,
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
is
not
available
because
the
revocation
proceeding
was
essentially
civil
in
nature,
the
aim
being
to
provide
treatment
instead
of
punishment.
and
as
the
illinois
supreme
court
was
noted
to
have
done
in
allen,
it
is
our
belief
that
the
montana
supreme
court
has
held
that
admissions
made
during
sex
offender
treatment
cannot
be
used
against
a
defendant
in
a
subsequent
prosecution.
and
this
court
in
allen
noted
as
well
its
decision
in
minnesota
v.
murphy
and
held
that
a
person
may
not
claim
the
privilege
merely
because
his
answer
might
result
in
revocation
of
his
probationary
status.
and
that's
all
that
occurred
in
this
case,
or
could
have
happened
in
light
of
thiel
and
in
light
of
murphy.
mr.
marc
racicot
i
understand
your
point,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
would
state
that
you
are
entirely
correct
that
it
is
not
precisely
framed
in
those
terms.
the
court
did
say
thiel
has
had
few
options
other
than
to
sacrifice
his
right
to
remain
silent
and
to
reveal
his
entire
past.
i
recognize
that
it
was
based
on
a
sense
of
fundamental
fairness.
but
as
well,
minnesota
v.
murphy
is
much
more
explicit
and
i
think
provides
the
same
result
and
is
applicable
to
the
courts
of
montana
and
the
state
of
montana
in
this
instance.
the
defendant
was
not--
mr.
marc
racicot
--our
position,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
they
are
not
incriminating,
but
even,
even
if
they
could
perceive
to
be
statements
of
that
nature,
that
nonetheless
murphy
would
proscribe
their
use
in
a
future
prosecution.
so
that
the
remedy
ultimately,
even
if
they
were
incriminating
statements,
would
be
available
and
would
eliminate
any
risk
of
violating
the
person's
right
against
his
self-incrimination.
the
defendant
was
not
compelled
in
this
case,
as
i
mentioned,
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
he
was
not
required
to
answer
questions
in
any
proceeding
where
the
answers
might
incriminate
him
in
a
future
criminal
proceeding.
in
the
first
place
he
testified
at
trial
and
was
convicted,
and
any
right
against
self-incrimination
as
it
applied
to
the
charge
defense
was
extinguished
as
a
result
of
that
testimony.
in
reference
to
uncharged
acts,
which
would
include
perjury,
by
virtue
of
this
court's
holding
in
murphy
those
statements
could
not
be
used
against
imlay
in
a
future
criminal
proceeding.
finally,
there
was
no
realistic
threat
of
incrimination
in
a
future
criminal
case.
the
state
intended
from
the
beginning
to
provide
treatment
and
not
punishment,
and
it's
obvious
that
there
was
no
realistic
threat
of
future
prosecution.
as
a
result
the
defendant
was
not
being
compelled
in
a
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself,
and
as
a
result
of
that
the
fifth
amendment
has
no
application.
the
revocation
of
probation
in
this
instance
as
well,
and
as
again
murphy
points
out,
is
not
a
penalty
that
triggers
fifth
amendment
protections
because
the
sought
after
admission
was
relevant
to
his
probationary
status
and
posed
no
realistic
threat
of
incrimination
in
a
separate
criminal
proceeding.
the
sentence
of
imprisonment
was
already
imposed.
the
outer
boundary
of
punishment
was
established,
and
then
leniency
was
offered
upon
the
condition
that
imlay
would
complete
sex
offender
treatment.
the
burden
was
therefore
upon
him
to
demonstrate
his
continued
entitlement
to
that
probation.
it
was
his
choice.
but
making
that
choice
did
not
trigger
the
protections
of
the
fifth
amendment
because
his
decision
to
refuse
to
accept
responsibility
did
not
enhance
or
augment
his
sentence.
the
defendant's
sentence
didn't
change,
only
the
conditions
of
the
sentence
changed.
there
was
no
increase
in
the
severity
of
that
sentence.
only
the
added
benefit
of
probation
was
changed
because
of
the
state's
obligation
to
provide
safety
and
security
as
well
as
rehabilitation
and
treatment.
the
state
has
to
have,
as
this
court
noted
in
murphy,
that
kind
of
authority
to
ask
questions
relevant
to
its
responsibilities
and
to
take
actions
against
a
defendant
whose
refusal
to
answer
impedes
the
discharge
of
those
responsibilities.
extending
leniency
to
one
who
is
willing
to
cooperate
is
what
was
attempted
here.
it's
not
a
case
where
the
sentence
of
a
defendant
who
has
committed
no
additional
offense
was
augmented
because
of
his
or
her
reliance
upon
the
protections
of
the
fifth
amendment.
imlay
testified,
as
i
mentioned,
at
trial,
and
responded
during
sex
offender
treatment
in
the
same
way.
in
both
instances
he
denied
the
crime,
but
he
did
so
voluntarily.
in
other
words
he
did
not
remain
silent
and
he
did
not
claim
his
fifth
amendment
privilege.
because
the
denial
was
voluntary
and
not
compelled
in
both
instances,
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
the
district
court
was
free
to
rely
on
the
defendant's
denial
in
revoking
probation.
the
revocation
occurred
on
the
basis
of
voluntary
statements
by
imlay
in
which
he
denied
the
sexual
assault.
the
protections
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
this
situation
are
not
self-executing.
if
imlay
desired
the
protection
of
the
privilege
he
had
to
claim
it.
he
didn't,
and
as
a
result
was
not
compelled
to
answer
within
the
meaning
of
that
amendment.
mr.
marc
racicot
it
depends
upon
what
theory--
mr.
marc
racicot
--it
was
not.
mr.
marc
racicot
i
do
not,
other
than
that
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
montana
has
held
that
in
fact
sua
sponte
raising
the
issue
is
dispositive
of
the
case
and
as
a
consequence--
mr.
marc
racicot
--that's
precisely
correct.
mr.
marc
racicot
that
is
correct.
mr.
marc
racicot
justice
scalia,
i
may
have
been
mistaken
in
informing
the
court
just
by
referring
to
the
murphy
case.
i
am
referring
to
minnesota
v.
murphy
wherein
the
probationer
in
that
instance
was--
mr.
marc
racicot
--yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
marc
racicot
this
decision,
if
left
standing,
will
substantially
impact
sentencing
options
and
adversely
affect
effects
to
carry
out
enlightened
and
effective
treatment
efforts
that
are
the
product
of
years
of
development.
mr.
marc
racicot
justice
souter,
there
are
other
ways
to
proceed,
you
are
entirely
correct.
we
could
proceed
in
the
fashion
that
the
federal
government
does
with
the
sentencing
guidelines.
the
only
difference
is
that
there
are
substantial
economies
and
there
are
also
substantial
retrievals
of
people
involved
in
this
system
because
as
they
go
through
the
treatment
process
we
are
able
to
then
i
think
secure
their
involvement
in
the
program
and
their
successful
completion.
you
have
to
make
a--
mr.
marc
racicot
--but
it
would
be,
justice
souter,
as
the
people
were
incarcerated
and
not
in
a
probationary
kind
of
status.
mr.
marc
racicot
and
that
allows
us
tremendous
economies
and
efficiencies.
and
in
terms
of
saving,
costs
associated
with
imprisoning
people
as
well
as
providing
incredible
flexibility
to
deal
with
people
in
individual
and
very
unique
circumstances.
this
case
if
it's
left
to
stand
in
montana
will
hurt
everyone,
not
the
least
of
which
will
be
criminal
defendants
who
because
of
these
inquiries
not
being
made
will
be
warehoused
instead
of
treated.
and
i
believe
that
will
be
precisely
the
case
if
this
case
is
not
overturned.
thank
you.
mr.
marc
racicot
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
first
of
all
in
reference
to
the
drummond
case
which
is
not
a
part
of
the
record,
it
is
not
altogether
clear
precisely
what
the
posture
of
that
case
is,
but
we
do
know
some
things.
first
of
all
the
cases
are
not
final.
secondly,
the
perjury
charge
in
that
case
was
the
result
of
two
different
sworn
statements
given
by
the
defendant,
one
at
his
original
sentencing
and
one
subsequently
at
a
civil
trial.
and
thirdly,
it
is
not
clear
at
all
that
there's
any
evidence
derivative
of
any
statements
that
he
made
during
sex
offender
treatment
that
were
relied
upon
for
subsequent
prosecution.
so
it
is
entirely
a
different
case.
and
in
reference
to
justice
stevens'
point,
which
obviously
poses
some
consternation
for
me
as
well,
if
we
lose,
justice
stevens,
the
parole
board
could
not
refuse
parole
based
upon
a
failure
to
complete
phase
2
of
the
sex
offender
treatment.
that's
what
we
want.
we
want
to
be
able
to
make
mr.
imlay
go
through
phase
2,
which
does
require
an
admission.
so
in
our
judgment
we
would
urge
upon
you
that
there
is
a
case
or
controversy.
mr.
marc
racicot
yes.
mr.
marc
racicot
that
is
my
recollection,
yes.
mr.
marc
racicot
that
is
not
in
the
record,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
know
that
to
be
the
case.
thank
you.
