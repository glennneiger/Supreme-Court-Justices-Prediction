justice
david
h.
souter
including
immunity
on
a
perjury
prosecution?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
i
mean,
my
question
assumed
that
he
would
be
immune
from
prosecution
using
evidence
obtained
through
the
therapist.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
answer
is
that
he
would
be
immune
under
those
circumstances?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
is
that
so?
i
mean,
couldn't
the
problem
simply
be
short
circuited
either
by
engaging
in
an
initial
colloquy
informing
him
that
if
he
wants
to
avail
himself
of
the
more
lenient
treatment
option
he
has
to
recognize
that
he
cannot
be
treated
for
something
that
he
does
not
admit
that
he
did,
so
that
his
choice
to
put
himself
in
the
position
that
he
is
in
right
now
would
be
a
voluntary
choice,
and
that
presumably
would
affect
the
result.
i
mean,
isn't
that
the...
if
you
lose
this
case
isn't
that
the
only
modification
in
procedure
that
you
would
have
to
take
in
order
to
preserve
the
possibility
of
treatment
programs?
