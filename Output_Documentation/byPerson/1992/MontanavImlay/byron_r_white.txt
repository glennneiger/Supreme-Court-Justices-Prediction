but
on
the
other
hand,
on
the
other
hand
if
you
lose
this
case
i
don't
know
whether
you
will
just,
if
it's
unconstitutional
for
you
to
make
him
admit,
you
may
go
offer
him
the
treatment
without
his
admitting
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know,
i
don't...
if
you
wouldn't
do
that
your
only
option
then
is
to
discontinue
all
of
this
kind
of
treatment,
program,
and
i
don't
know
whether
the
state
will
do
that
just
because
he
won't
admit
guilt.
justice

well,
but...
the
other
part
of
it
though
wouldn't
let
him
out
before
5
years?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
would
have
to
come
around
and
admit
guilt
under
the
program?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
he
be
subject
to
perjury
for
lying
to
a
therapist?
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
decided
it
as
a
fifth
amendment
issue,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
whether
it
was
raised
before,
they
nevertheless
decided
it.
