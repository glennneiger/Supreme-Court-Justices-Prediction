justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
preliminary
question
before
you
get
into
your
argument?
he
originally
had
a
5-year
sentence
that
was
suspended,
and
then
parole
was
revoked,
and
then
he
received
another
5-year
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
you
win
this
case
he
will
serve
out
a
5-year
sentence,
and
if
you
lose
this
case
he
will
also
serve
out
a
5-year
sentence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
in
either
even
he
serves
5
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
still
a
little
puzzled.
which
way
will
he
be
eligible
for
parole?
if
you
win
or
if
you
lose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
really
trying
to
advance
his
interests?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
is
better
off
if
you
win
than
if
you
lose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
once
more
to
be
sure
i've
got
the
sequence
right?
you're
talking
about
what
he
wasn't
compelled
to
do.
there
are
three
different
orders
entered
by
the
district
court.
am
i
right
in
this
regard?
first,
a
5-year
sentence
but
suspended
on
this
condition.
second,
the
district
judge
revoked
that
and
said
you
go
away
for
5
years
but
you
can
then
get
treatment
in
prison.
that
was
the
second
order.
then
the
supreme
court
reversed
that
order
and
sent
it
back
for
further
proceedings.
what
was
the
third
order
that
was
entered?
was
it
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
under
the
present
order
even
if
he
takes
the
sex
offender
treatment
he
still
can't
get
out
in
less
than
5
years?
is
that
the
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
then
that
under
the
order
of
the
district
court
that
was
subsequently
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
and
under
the
order
entered
on
remand
precisely
the
same
condition
applies.
in
other
words
he
has
a
chance
to
get
the
inpatient
treatment
and
he
might
get
out
if
he
does,
and
if
he
won't
admit
he'll
spend
the
5
years
in
jail.
and
that's
true
either
under
the
order
that
the
montana
supreme
court
reversed
or
under
the
order
that
was
entered
after
the
reversal.
am
i
right
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i
really
don't
see
how
it
makes
a
particle
of
difference
who
wins
or
loses
this
case.
i
don't
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
understand
the
advisory
opinion
would
be
very
important
to
you.
that's
true.
but
in
terms
of
the
litigants
in
the
particular
case
or
controversy
before
us
i
don't
see
how
montana
gains
or
loses
anything
with
respect
to
its
relationship
with
this
defendant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
mootness.
it's
a
question
of
whether
there's
an
actual
case
or
controversy
that
makes
any
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
he
is
now
compelled
to
spend
5
years
in
jail
if
he
doesn't
do
it.
that's
the
only
way
you
can
compel
him.
it's
the
same
choice
he
has.
he
either
admits
guilt
and
goes
through
it
and
gets
some
benefit
from
it,
or
he
doesn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
it
matters
whether
he
admits
guilt
or
not.
it
still
will
be...
the
two
orders
come
out
exactly
the
same
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
that
raises
the
question
whether
the
order
under
review
was
really
final
and
whether
it
had
jurisdiction,
i
suppose,
at
the
time,
granting
review
at
the
time
we
did.
well,
i
have
these
concerns
about
whether
we
really
have
a
live
case.
i
thought
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that,
that
has
never
been
ruled
on,
has
it?
so
if
we
agreed
with
you
i
suppose
they
could
then
consider
that
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
