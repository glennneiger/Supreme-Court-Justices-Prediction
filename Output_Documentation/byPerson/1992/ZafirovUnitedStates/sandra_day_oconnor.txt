justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
ms.
zafiro
ever
ask
for
severance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
she
properly
before
the
court
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
the
trial
court
can
give
an
appropriate
instruction
regarding
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
part
of
the
government.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we
normally
assume
that
jurors
will
follow
such
instructions.
does
that
cure
the
concert
that
you
have,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me,
but
if
we
assume
that
a
proper
instruction
is
given,
why
do
we
have
to
assume
there
is
confusion?
i
don't
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
take
the
position
that
had
the
trial
judge
here
granted
a
severance,
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion?
