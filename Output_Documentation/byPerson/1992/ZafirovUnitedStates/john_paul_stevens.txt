justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
you
know,
in
a
sense...
i'm
just
trying
to
think
this
thing
through.
the
two
pairs...
one
testified
and
the
other
didn't
testify
at
all,
as
i
remember
it.
like
soto
testified
that
garcia
had
the...
knew
the
contents
of
the
suitcase,
and
garcia
did
not
take
the
stand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
the
joint
trial
one
would
be
more
apt
to
believe
soto
simply
because
of
the
fact
that
the
other
defendant
didn't
get
up
on
the
stand
and
say
anything.
the
jury
might
say,
well,
maybe
he's
telling
the
truth
because
nobody
has
denied
this,
whereas
if
he
was
there
all
by
himself,
he
might
be
less
apt
to
do
it.
i'm
just
not
quite
clear
why
it's...
there
is
a
greater
probability
of
conviction
on
these
facts
than
if
they
had
been
tried
separately.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
not
evidence,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
these
facts
weren't
all
that
complicated
really.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
what
do
you
say
when
you
make
your
motion
for
severance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cunniff,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
think
at
the
outset
of
your
argument
you
said
something
to
the
effect
the
government
is
asking
for
a
new...
to
change
the
settled
law
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a
line
of
cases
that's
fairly...
a
lot
of
cases
that
hold
that
whenever
there
are
antagonistic
defenses,
severance
is
normally
granted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
you
cited
all
those
in
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
the
text
writers?
have
they
written
on
this
issue,
do
you
know?
are
there
any
law
review...
any...
is
there
any,
you
know,
scholarly
writing
on
this
very
precise--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i'm
not...
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
but,
mr.
manning,
i'm
not
sure
that's
always
going
to
be
true.
take
your
uncle
and
nephew
case
or
even
take
in
this
case
mr.
garcia's
position.
he,
in
effect,
said
if
i
am
tried
separately,
i
will
get
on
the
stand
and
say
soto
knew
all
about
it
and
i
knew
nothing.
but
they're
tried
together
and
he
apparently
elected
not
to
point
the
finger
at
his
co-defendant.
now,
there
could
be
cases...
i
don't
know
if
there
are
or
not...
in
which
there
is,
in
fact,
an
innocent
person
out
with
his
uncle
or
something
like
that
who,
if
tried
separately,
would
tell
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth,
but
would
be
unwilling
to
get
on
the
stand
in
a
courtroom
with
his
accomplice
and
accuse
somebody
who's
a
member
of
his
family
or
somebody
he's
very
close
to.
so,
it's
conceivable
that
the
antagonistic
defense
would
actually
prevent
somebody
from
testifying
who
would
otherwise
testify.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
that's
possible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
might
fear
retaliation,
for
example,
that
he
might
not
receive
if
he
testified
in
a
separate
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
might
be
afraid
of
retaliation.
sometimes
witnesses
are
afraid
to
get
on
the
stand
in
certain
situations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
have
a
separate
trial,
it
wouldn't
hurt
the
uncle
any.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure,
if
you
get
immunity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we're
assuming
no
immunity
here.
that's
an
entirely
different
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
talking
about
immunity.
immunity
has
nothing
to
do
with
it.
i'm
just
talking
about
the
government
doesn't
know
which
of
the
two
did
it,
but
in
fact...
and
it's
possible...
one
of
them
is,
in
fact,
innocent
but
would
be
unwilling
to
get
on
the
witness
stand
in
a
joint
trial,
but
would
be
willing
to
do
so
in
a
separate
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
at
least
a
hypothetical
possibility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
my
hypothesis,
all
the
facts
didn't
come
before
the
jury
because
the
innocent
defendant
was
unwilling
to
testify
with
the
other
antagonistic
defendant
in
the
courtroom.
in
other
words,
that's
what
might
have
been
true
of
mr.
garcia--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
didn't
understand
you
really
to
acknowledge
that.
as
i
understand,
the
logic
of
your
position
is
you
should
always
reject
a
motion
for
severance
when
the
only
ground
for
it
is
antagonistic
defenses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
is
that
not
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
that's
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask.
let
me...
i
think
i've
got
the...
is
it
the
government's
position
that
if
the
only
ground
for
severance
is
antagonism
of
the
two
defenses,
the
judge
should
always
deny
the
motion?
