justice
byron
r.
white
did...
there
were
four
defendants,
and
did
each
one
of
them
make
a
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
they
want
to
be
separates
from
all
the
other
three?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
got
it.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
that
about
the
co-defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
order...
you
have
to
know
that
the...
you
have
to
know
that
your
co-defendant
is
going
to
take
the
stand,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you've
been
talking
about
one
co-defendant
testifying
against
the
other
one.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
how
do
you
know
he's...
when
you
make
your
motion
that
he's
going
to
be
testifying?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
you
make
a
motion
for
severance
at
the
time
your
co-defendant
decides
to
take
the
stand?
you
don't
know
he's
going
to
take
the
stand
or
not,
and
he
decides
to
take
the
stand.
can
you
then
make
a
motion
for
severance?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
would...
and
so,
who...
there
would
have
to
be
two
new
trials.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
would
the
trial
against
the
other
two
of
the
four
stop
also?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
your
motion
would
waive
double
jeopardy.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
isn't
until
he's...
until
the
government
withstands
a
motion
to
dismiss.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
the
government
has
got
to
make
its
case
and
sustain
a
motion.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
guess
if
the
defendants
decide
to
take
the
stand
because
they
think
if
they
don't,
they're
going
to
be
cooked
because
the
government
has
made
a
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
still
didn't
know
whether
he
was
going
to
take
the
stand
or
not,
and
he
still
didn't
know
whether
or
not
the
government
could
prove
their
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
somebody
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
any
court
of
appeals,
besides
the
seventh,
taken
a...
taken
your
view?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
could
all
these
other
courts
have
been
so
far
off
base?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
i
think
you'll
say
they
were.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
most
of
the
cases
against
you
where
they
say
severance
wasn't
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
there
some
that
say
severance
should
be
required?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
were
they...
was
that
order
put
in
before
trial
or
during
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
couldn't
be
a
plainer
case
of
antagonistic
defenses.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
definition
of
an
antagonistic
defense
is
that
if
you
believe
one
of
them,
you
necessarily
convict
the
other
or
you
disbelieve
him,
here
everybody
was
convicted.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
didn't
believe...
they
believed
both
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
people
who...
all
of
the
people
who
moved
for
severance
were
convicted.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
other
four.
justice
byron
r.
white
how...
which
was
the
first
decision
in
this
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
started
this
snowball?
justice
byron
r.
white
back
in
the
'30's?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
all
right.
thank
you.
