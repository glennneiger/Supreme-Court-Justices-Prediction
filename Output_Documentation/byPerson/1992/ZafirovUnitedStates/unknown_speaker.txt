unknown
speaker
the
government
in
their
brief
takes
the
position
that
a
single
jury
in
a
joint
trial
would
have
to
virtually
conclude
that
some
of
the
petitioners
are
guilty.
the
jury's
task
would
be
to
decide
which,
if
any,
of
the
petitioner's
stories
seemed
plausible
and
convict
those
whose
did
not.
that's
the
standard
which
the
government
referred
to
in
their
brief.
the
difficulty
with
this
standard
is
that's
not
the
burden
of
proof.
it's
not
up
to
a
jury
to
determine
which
of
the
stories
seem
plausible,
but
it's
up
to
the
jury
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
government
had
met
their
burden
of
proof
with
respect
to
each
element
of
the
crime
which
he's
charged.
i
suppose
if
the
government
wanted
to
make
sure
they
had
that
evidence
that
you
object
to
from
the
other
defendant,
they...
if
they
severed
and
they
gave
him
immunity,
you're
going
to
have
the
same
testimony
against
your
client.
unknown
speaker
you
don't?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
