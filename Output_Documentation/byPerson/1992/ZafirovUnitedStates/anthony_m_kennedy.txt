i
just
don't
understand
that
fully.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
probability
of
a
correct
result,
of
a
nonerroneous
determination,
is
much
higher
where
all
of
the
witnesses
can
testify
before
the
same
trier
of
fact.
it
seems
to
me
a
very
elemental
proposition.

but
in
the
hypothetical
with
the
uncle
and
the
nephew
with
the
shotgun,
you
would
say
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
sever
even
if
the
nephew
was
reluctant
to
testify.
justice

well,
as
the
hypothetical
has
been
discussed
here,
you'd
say
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
grant,
would
you
not?
