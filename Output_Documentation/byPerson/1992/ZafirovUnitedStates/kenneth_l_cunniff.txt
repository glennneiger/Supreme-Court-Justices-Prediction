mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
it's
cunniff.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
is
whether
criminal
defendants
are
entitled
to
separate
trials
when
their
defenses
are
mutually
antagonistic.
this
case
involved
four
defendants
charged
with
narcotics
violations.
each
moved
for
severance
based
upon
antagonistic
defenses
that
he
or
she
said
were
going
to
be
presented
at
trial.
the
trial
judge
denied
the
motion,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--yes,
your
honor,
each
made
a
motion.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
no,
your
honor.
it
was
broken
down
in
two
separate
pairs.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
in
affirming--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--she
did
ask
for
severance
at
the
trial
level.
she
did
not
raise
it
in
the
appellate
court,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
i
would
suggest
under
fundamental
fairness
she
should
be
because
if
this
court
finds
that
the
antagonistic
defenses
are
still
a
proper
basis
for
severance,
it
had
been
raised
previously,
and
she
should
still
be
considered
in
that
position.
in
this
case,
it
is
the
government's...
it
the
government
that
is
asking
for
a
radical
departure
from
the
accepted
rule
of
severance.
until
now,
although
the
circuits
used
different
standards,
there
was
a
common
element
that
ran
through
all
of
the
decisions
of
each
of
the
courts.
if
a
defendant
raised
an
antagonistic
defense,
he
was
entitled
to
severance.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
improperly
relies
upon
civil
law
for
its
rationale
using
the
analogy
of
interpleader
and
using
the
analogy
of
joint
tort
cases.
in
doing
this,
it
fails
to
distinguish
the
fundamental
differences
between
a
civil
trial
and
a
criminal
trial.
and
as
this
court
is
aware,
in
a
criminal
case
the
defendant
by
law
is
presumed
to
be
innocent.
the
burden
never
shifts
to
the
defendant,
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
failing
to
distinguish
between
the
civil
case
and
the
criminal
case,
there
is
a
serious
risk
that
a
joint
trial
would
confuse
the
jury
and
prevent
the
jury
from
making
a
reliable
judgment
about
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
one
or
more
of
the
defendants.
when
co-defendants
attack
each
other
and
attack
each
other's
defenses
before
the
jury,
they
blur
together
as
one,
and
as
a
result,
both
defendants
are
likely
to
be
convicted
because
neither
defense
is
believed.
in
their
antagonism,
each
lawyer
becomes
the
government's
champion
against
the
other
co-defendants.
the
resulting
struggle
makes
each
of
the
defendants
vulnerable,
as
courts
have
held,
to
the
insinuation
that
it's
a
conspiracy
that
would
explain
the
conflict.
the--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
but
again,
in
a
criminal
case
it's
not
up
to
the
defendant
to
have
to
prove
his
innocence,
and
this
court
decision
actually
results
in
a
shifting
of
the
burden
of
proof
from
the
government
to
the
defendant
because
when
the
defendant
gets
up,
he
then
not
only
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
he
himself
is
telling
the
truth,
he
also
must
convince
the
jury
that
the
co-defendant
is
lying.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
you
would,
your
honor.
if
his
co-defendant
who
has
pled
guilty
or
been
found
guilty
who
is
testifying,
in
that
situation
the
co-defendant
says
i'm
guilty
and
my
accomplice
was
the
defendant
on
trial.
it's
different
than
in
a
situation
where
a
defendant
is
on
trial
saying
i
am
innocent,
but
it's
the
co-defendant
who
is
really
guilty,
and
for
my
defense
to
be
believed,
the
co-defendant
must
be
found
guilty.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
i'm
talking
as
a
practical
matter
and
also
focusing
in
on
the
specific
language
of
judge
posner,
if
i
can
refer
your
honors
to
the
opinion.
the
court
said
if
it's,
indeed,
certain
that
one
and
only
one
of
a
group
of
defendants
is
guilty,
the
entire
group
should
be
tried
together
since
in
separate
trials
all
might
be
acquitted
or
all
convicted.
in
either
case,
it's
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
the
problem
is
that
the
difficulty
is
that
you
have
a
particular
defendant
who
then's
defense
is
going
to
become
blurred.
let
me
give
you
perhaps
an
example.
we
have
four
defendants
who
are
in
a
jail
cell
together,
and
one
of
the
defendants
is
murdered.
and
the
government
has
no
other
evidence
other
than
the
fact
one
of
the
defendants
in
the
jail
cell
is
murdered,
but
there
were
only
three
other
people
there.
under
this
theory
of
judge
posner,
if
all
three
were
tried
together,
the
jury
would
then
be
able
to
find
which
of
the
three...
by
the
time
that
each
made
their
presentation,
if
in
fact
one
was
made,
the
jury
would
be
able
to
find
which
of
the
three
committed
the
murder.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
and
in
fact,
that's
the
point
i
would
try
and
make,
your
honor,
because
the
government
would
have
to
prove
a
particular
defendant
guilty
with
specific
elements--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--proving
specific
elements.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
it
doesn't,
your
honor,
but
what
is
does
do
is
by
not
allowing
severance,
it
no
longer...
by
not
allowing
severance,
the
difficulty
is
each
defendant
is
going
to
be
prejudiced,
and
the
jury
is
going
to
be
unable
to
focus
its
attention
on
the
individual
defendant
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
prosecution
has
met
its
burden
of
proving
each
and
every
element
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that's
where
the
concern
comes
in.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
and,
in
fact--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--but
again,
in
judge
posner's
opinion,
he
talks
about
specifically
the
analogy
to
interpleader
and
to
joint
tort
cases,
and
when
you're
bringing
those
types
of
analogy
into
a
criminal
case,
you're
then
talking
about
relative
degrees
of
responsibility
or
relative
degrees
of
fault
which
i'd
respectfully
suggest
is
inappropriate
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
that's...
in
fact,
there's
no
doubt
it
was
brought
by
both
people.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
which
if
either,
knew
what
the
contents
was
of
this
very
large
package
that
was
brought
up
to
the
apartment.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
there
would
be
an
irony,
your
honor,
but
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
that
probably
would
not
occur
if,
in
fact,
the
government
was
able
to
prove
each
of
the
defendants
guilty
and
to
show
the
knowledge
which
would
be
inferred
by
virtue
of
the
fact
of
the
possession
without
explaining
what
was
contained
in
the
suitcase
or
the
package
that
was
being
carried
by
each
individual.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
i
believe
that
the--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--it
does
not,
your
honor,
and
it
does
not
because
it's
the
position
of
the
petitioner
that
as
a
result
of
the
antagonistic
defense,
when
each
defendant
is
going
against
the
other
defendant
rather
than
the
government
going
against
the
defendant,
what
you
have
is
a
blurring
and
there's
confusion.
and
the
concern
is
there's
a
substantial
likelihood
that
a
conviction
is
going
to
result
not
because
of
the
evidence--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--the
difficulty
is
the
jury
focuses
in
on
each
of
the
defendant's
defenses,
and
because
each
is,
in
effect,
saying
the
other
person
did
it
and
i'm
innocent,
the
concern
of
the
other
cases
in
all
the
other
circuits
that
have
considered
this
question
is
that
the
jury
will
be
unable
to
differentiate
between
the
defendant
or
the
defendants.
and
that's
the
reason
why
up
until
this
opinion,
every
other
circuit
recognized
that
antagonistic
defenses
should
be
a
grounds
for
severance.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
the
difficulty
is
in
a
criminal
case,
the
question
isn't
whether
or
not
a
particular
act
was
done.
the
question,
i
respectfully
suggest,
is
whether
or
not
the
particular
defendant
has
been
charged
with
the
particular...
who
has
been
charged
with
a
particular
crime
is
proved
guilty
of
each
of
those
elements
of
the
crime
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
not
whether
or
not
the
act
actually
occurred,
not
whether
or
not
the
package
was
actually
carried
up
by
either
of
the
two
defendants,
but
whether
or
not
the
government
proved
the
elements,
including
knowledge
of
what
was
in
the
container,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
would
suggest,
your
honor,
that
would
be
the
distinction.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there
would
be
the
same
testimony,
but
that
would
be
coming
in
an
immunized
situation
as
opposed
to
a
co-defendant
on
trial
saying
that
he
himself
is
innocent.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
because
i
think
what
occurs,
your
honor,
is
that
when
garcia's
attorney
in
closing
argument
took
the
contrary
position
and
said
really
it
was
soto
who
possessed,
it
was
soto's
home,
it
was
soto's
automobile,
what
in
effect
occurred
was
they
had
two
co-defendants,
in
effect,
trying
each
other
and
trying
to
convict
each
other
rather
than
permitting
the
government
to
convict...
try
to
convict
the
defendant
as
a
trial
should
actually
proceed.
and
what
you
have
here...
and
you
can
even
take
your
honor's
example
further.
if
soto
testifies
and
testifies
that
really
it's
garcia
who
did
all
of
these
things,
and
garcia
does
not
testify,
it's
solely
garcia's
attorney
in
his
closing
argument
which...
who
says
it
really
was
soto.
the
courts
instruct
the
jury
that
closing
arguments
are
merely--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--the
arguments
of
counsel
and
you're
supposed
to
rely--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--on
evidence.
i
think
it
shows
that
even
in
that
situation,
as
a
situation
in
this
case,
when
those
things
will
occur,
the
practical
effect
is
the
facts
get
blurred,
and
the
jury
begins
to
confuse
what
each
of
the
defenses
are
and
convicted
both.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
very
simple,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
that
you
anticipate
that
the...
during
a
trial
that
you
are
going
to
have
evidence
presented
against
you
by
a
co-defendant
which
will
not
only
exonerate
the
co-defendant,
but
which
will
force--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--in
this
particular
case,
there
had
been
motions
to
suppress,
and
there
had
been
statements
made
prior
to
trial.
so,
there
was
a
pretty
good
indication
that
each
defense
was
going
to
rely
on
having
an
antagonistic
defense
in
which
there
would
be
an
attempt
to
get
one
defendant--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--you
don't
have
to
know
that,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
i
don't...
i'm
not
sure
that
you
would
have
to
know
that.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
that's
what
occurred
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
you
don't
know
that
at
the
time
of
making
the
motion
in
all
probability.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
if
you
don't
know
that
the
co-defendant
is
going
to
take
the
stand,
you
probably
would
not
know
about
the
prejudice.
at
the
moment
he
does
take
the
stand,
you
would
obviously
know
of
the
prejudice.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--generally
you
would
not
know
that.
in
this
particular
case,
you
did
know
it
because
of
the
pretrial
proceedings.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
you
could
then
make
a
motion
for
severance.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
it
would
be
within
the
sound
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
to
make
the
determination
whether
or
not
the--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--if
you
make
the
motion,
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
you
are
waiving
the
argument
of
double
jeopardy.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
if
they
didn't
move
for
a
mistrial
based
on
what
was
the
prejudicial
evidence
which
had
been
admitted,
i
don't
believe
they'd
have
a
double
jeopardy
offense...
double
jeopardy--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--it's
not
just
that
it
hurts
the
client,
but
in
terms
of
the
defense
which
is
presented
for
the
defendant's
testimony
to
be
believed,
it
requires
that
the
jury
convict
the
co-defendant,
which
would
be...
that's
the
basic
argument
in
terms
of
what
the
antagonistic
defense
is.
and
it's...
so,
when
he's...
when
the
co-defendant
is
arguing
that
my...
when
the
co-defendant
is
arguing
that
he
knew
nothing
about
the
possession
of
the
large
box
which
contained
the
cocaine,
but
really
it
was
the
co-defendants,
in
that...
at
that
point,
it's
shifting
the
burden.
he
is
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
to
compel
the
co-defendant
to
get
back
up
and
say,
no,
it
really
wasn't
mine.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
in
effect,
what
occurs
here,
though,
justice,
is
that
the
defendant
is
becoming
the
prosecutor
to
convict
his
co-defendant.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
and
at
that
point,
there
is
a
prima
facie
case,
and
this
only
occurs
after
the
motions
for
directed
verdict
of
acquittal
have
been
denied.
but
at
that
point,
there
would
be
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
a
jury
in
terms
of
a
prima
facie
case,
but
perhaps
not
sufficient
to
convict
using
the
standard
which
the
government
must
use.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
in
this
particular
situation,
your
honor,
the
defendant
had,
by
way
of
affidavit,
said
before
trial
that
he
did
intend
to
testify,
and
he
did
lay
out
what
the
testimony...
what
he
believed
his
testimony
would
show.
so,
the
court
was
aware
pretrial
on
the
grounds
for
the
motions
for
severance.
and
it's
interesting
that--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--if
in
fact,
as
the
other
justices
have
pointed
out,
if
the
man
is
caught
with...
if
the
man
has
in
his
physical
possession
a
package
of
50
pounds
of
cocaine
and
there's
a
joint
possession
of
it--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--somebody
did
it.
what's
interesting
in
this
case
is
both
at
trial
and
at
the
appellate
level,
the
government
took
the
position
that
this
was
mere
finger
pointing,
and
now
up
in
this
court,
it
concedes
that
it's
an
antagonistic
defense.
and
what
we're
asking
of
this
court
is
that
it
find
that
antagonistic
defenses
still
require
severance
and
the
defendants
are
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
in
the
finger
pointing,
i'm
simply
saying
that
someone
else
did
a
particular
act.
with
the
antagonistic
defense,
i'm
saying
the
examples
which
the
courts
give
in
the
deluna
case
is
you
have
an
individual
whose...
two
individuals
standing
on
a
street
corner,
and
as
one
of
the
individuals
sees
the
police
officer
come
down
the
street,
he
hands
the
narcotics
to
the
other
individual.
their
defense
at
trial
is
the
person
who
is
holding
the
narcotics
that
was
handed
to
me
as
the
police
officer
came
down
the
street,
and
i
didn't
possess
it
before
trial,
and
i
received
it
from
the
other
co-defendant
while
the
other
co-defendant
says
simply
i
never
possessed
it
all,
i
was
merely
standing
there.
acceptance
of
one
of
the
defendant's
defenses
requires
the
finding
of
the
other
defendant
guilty.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
yes,
there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
yes,
i
have,
your
honor.
specifically,
i
have
all
of
them
cited
in
the
brief,
and
the
specific
circuits
are...
the
fourth,
the
tenth,
and
eleventh,
and
the
d.c.
circuit
take
the
position
that
severance
is
required
when
the
co-defendants
present
irreconcilable
or
mutually
exclusive
defenses,
and
the
jury
will
unjustifiably
infer
that
the
conflicting
defenses
are
in
and
of
themselves
established
that
both
defendants
are
guilty.
the
second,
the
fifth,
and
the
seventh,
up
until
this
case,
held
that
standard
that
severance
is
required
if
the
defenses
are
inconsistent
to
the
degree
that
accepting
one
co-defendant's
defense
would
preclude
a
jury
from
accepting
the
other's
defense.
so,
in
each
case
in
which
this
has
occurred
and
which
the
jury
found
that
there
are
antagonistic
defenses,
uniformly
all
of
the
courts
have
required
severance.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
i'm
not
aware
of
it
because--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--there
was
a
clear
differentiation
between
a
court
finding
something
was
finger
pointing
as
opposed
to
antagonistic
defense,
and
in
every
other
instance
in
which
there's
an
antagonistic
defense
finding,
the
courts
have
required
that
there
be
a
severance.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
as
counsel
for
the
government
just
told
you,
the
11
of
the
12
circuits
that
have
considered
this
question
have
all
agreed
that
if
an
antagonistic
defense
is
presented,
there
should
be
grounds
for
severance.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
i
don't
recall--
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
--it
started
back
in
the
'30's,
your
honor,
i
believe.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
have
the
specific
cases
in
front
of
me.
mr.
kenneth
l.
cunniff
but
in
each
of
the
cases...
and
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
suggest
the
reason
there
probably
is
no
scholarly
work
in
this
area
is
because
the
reason
is
because
up
until
this
particular
case,
there
was
no
need
for
it.
it
was
uniformly
accepted
that
the
prejudice
is
so
inherent,
if
you
have
an
antagonistic
defense
presented
by
a
co-defendant,
that
the
defendant
cannot
receive
a
fair
trial.
and
i
would
suggest
respectfully
that's
the
reason
that
each
of
the
circuits
that
considered
this
question
said
that
a
co-defendant
is
entitled
to
a
severance
if
an
antagonistic
defense
is
presented
by
a
co-defendant.
counsel
for
the
government
said
that
the
fact
that
zafiro
was
acquitted
of
the
substantive
count
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
shows
that
the
jury
followed
the
instructions,
and
i
would
suggest
respectfully
a
review
of
the
record
shows
that
if
she's
found
guilty
of
conspiracy
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
the
facts
in
the
case
showed
she
also
should
have
been
convicted
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
reason
for
the
distinction
is
the
jury
was
confused.
and
the
difficulty
is
that
the
two
defenses
were
always
blurred
together.
and
when
the
defendants
become
each
other's
prosecutor,
the
jury
is
likely
to
be
confused,
and
the
result
is
there's
going
to
be
a
substantial
likelihood
that
both
will
be
convicted.
and
i
would
suggest
that's
the
reason
why
each
circuit
that
considered
this
question
came
up
with
a
uniform
rule
of
law.
thank
you,
your
honors.
