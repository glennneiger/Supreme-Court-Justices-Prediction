mr.
john
f.
manning
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
have
three
points
here.
first,
the
motion
for
severance
is
typically
made
at
the
beginning
of
trial
and
then
renewed
again
throughout.
that
was
what
occurred
in
this
case,
and
that
is
a
fairly
standard
practice.
this
court
has
made
clear
that
the
obligation
under
rule
14
to
consider
the
question
of
severance
is
a
continuing
obligation
on
the
trial
court
throughout
trial.
the
difficulty,
however,
is
that
when
defendants
file
a
motion
for
severance
at
the
outset,
it
is
very
difficult
to
tell
how
the
trial
is
to
proceed,
and
the
better
practice
for
the
district
court
is
to
wait
the
development
of
the
trial
and
see
if
there
is,
in
fact,
prejudice
from
any
source
before
it
renders
the
decision
to
severe.
in
this
case,
for
example,
on...
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
101,
for
example,
the
attorney
for
salvador
garcia
indicated
that
mr.
garcia
would
testify
that
the
box
of
cocaine
was
soto's
and
not
his
own.
mr.
garcia
did
not
testify
at
trial.
there's
a
great
incentive
in
filing
a
pretrial
motion
for
severance
to
indicate
that
there
are
matters
that
will
result
in
prejudice
to
the
defendants
even
if
those
don't
eventuate
at
trial.
so,
any
broad
rule
under
rule
14...
broad
application
of
rule
14
will
likely
result
in
the
reversal
of
trials
at
the
conclusion
of
trial.
but
more--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--his
motion
on
page
81
of
the--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--i
believe
it's
on
page
81,
your
honor.
he
does
also
say
that
he
will
testify,
but
he
did
in
fact
testify
at
trial.
more
fundamentally
than
the
practical
point,
however,
we
have
a
basic
difference
with
the
petitioners
on
what
it
means
to
be
tried
in
a
case
with
a
defendant
presenting
an
inconsistent
defense.
our
view
is
not
that
presentation
of
inconsistent
defenses
will
blur
the
case.
rather,
it
is
our
view
that,
consistent
with
the
premises
of
our
system
of
justice,
the
truth
is
more
likely
to
be
learned
when
there
are
powerful
statements
on
both
sides
of
a
difference
of
opinion
about
factual
disputes.
soto
and
garcia,
as
you
know,
were
both
carrying
55
pounds
of
cocaine
up
a
stairwell
when
they
were
caught
by
police.
each
of
them
naturally
claimed
at
trial
that
the
box
of
cocaine
belonged
to
the
other
and
that
he
didn't
know
what
was
inside
of
it.
if
each
of
them
had
a
different
account
of
events
with
which
both
were
familiar,
then
the
jury's
understanding
was
inevitably
sharpened
and
not
dulled
as
each
tried
to
show
through
evidence,
cross-examination,
and
closing
argument
that
his
story
was
true,
and
his
co-defendant's--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--your
honor,
there
are
not.
the--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
your
honor,
as
our--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--we
do
believe
that
they
are.
and
i
would
want
to
point
out
one
thing,
that
this
is
the
interpretation
of
a
rule
and
the
fact
that
11
out
of
12
circuits
have
viewed
it
a
certain
way
does
not
mean
that
the
interpretation
is
correct,
particularly
when
you
consider
the
fact
that
most
of
the
circuits
have
articulated
standards
which
varied
from
one
another
somewhat.
there...
a
representative
sample
is
cited
in
our
brief
at
footnote
5.
but
typically
the
way
that
this
issue
arises
in
a
court
of
appeals
case
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
will
articulate
one
or
the
other
of
the
varying
standards
as
boiler
plate
en
route
to
holding
that
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
broad
discretion
in
determining
not
to
sever
a
trial
for
antagonistic
defenses.
the
court
will
typically
find
that
there's
some
reason
that
the
defense
is
not
antagonistic,
for
example,
a
defense--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
there's--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
manning
typically
i
believe
that
the
order
for
severance
was
denied
before
trial.
i'm
not
sure
in
some...
whether
in
some
cases
it
was
renewed
throughout
trial,
but
typically
the
kind
of
case
in
which
severance
is
granted
is
in
our
view
precisely
the
kind
of
case
in
which
severance
should
not
be
granted
when
a
joint
trial
is
most
helpful
to
the
finder
of
fact.
typically
the
case
is
like
this
one
where
it
is
perfectly
plain
that
at
least
one
of
the
two
defendants...
or
two
or
more
defendants
has
some
guilt
for
the
crime.
mr.
john
f.
manning
they
couldn't.
i
mean,
typically
there
are
cases
where
you
have
an
uncle
and
his
nephew
sitting
on
the
front
seat
of
a
car
with
a
shotgun,
and
the
police
come
and
they
find
the
shotgun.
and
the
nephew
and
the
uncle
say,
look,
it's...
these
are
antagonistic
defenses.
we'll
be
prejudiced
if
we
are
tried
together.
and
in
fact,
they
will
be
disadvantaged
by
being
tried
together
because
the
jury
will
get
a
full
picture
of
the
case,
and
if
they've
tried
to
shift
blame
onto
each
other,
the
two
defendants,
then--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
manning
we
think...
it's
certainly
possible,
but
we
think
it
highly
unlikely.
i
mean,
in
the
run
of
the
mill
case,
what
you're
dealing
with
is
two
people
who
are
closely
connected
with
criminal
wrongdoing
and
who...
one
of
whom
is
likely
guilty.
in
the
case
that
you
posited,
in
any
case,
the
decision
of
the
nephew
not
to
take
the
stand
because
he's
going...
he
might
inculcate
his
uncle
is
a
decision
that
he's
making.
it's
a
litigation
strategy--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
john
f.
manning
yes,
but
that...
i
think
that's
the
concern
that
exists
whether
or
not
you're
tried
together
or
in
a
separate
trial.
i
mean,
you
may
not
want
to
testify
against
your
uncle
in
a
single
trial.
you
may
not
want
to
in
a
joint
trial.
mr.
john
f.
manning
it
would
hurt
the
uncle
if
the
government
gave
the
nephew
immunity
and
called
him
to
testify.
in
that
case--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--there
would
be
no
choice
but--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
john
f.
manning
but
it's
a
somewhat...
i
think
that
it's
not
a
natural
reading
of
rule
14
to
read
it
as
a
mechanism
for
requiring
the
government
to
give
immunity
to
a
reluctant
witness
in
the
case
in
question--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--but,
your
honor--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--certainly,
and
the
premise
of
our
adversary
system
is
that
when
you
bring
all
the
facts
before
a
jury,
whether
or
not
the
person
got
on
a
witness
stand
or
not,
that
the
jury
would
make
the
accurate--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--i
understand
that.
perhaps
it
would
help
if
i
clarified
what
our
position
is.
our
position
is
not
that
the
question
of
antagonistic
defenses
would
never
be
relevant
to
the
determination
whether
to
sever
a
trial.
under
rule
14,
the
language
of
the
rule
provides
that
if
a
defendant
is
prejudiced
by
joinder,
a
district
court
may
grant
severance
or
provide
whatever
other
relief
justice
requires.
now,
by
its
terms,
that
language
gives
the
district
court
broad
discretion
to
consider
prejudicial
joinder.
now,
we
perfectly...
we
acknowledge
that
antagonistic
defenses
may
be
one
of
many
factors--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
when
the...
the
only--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--when
the
grounds...
the
only
ground
is
the
antagonism
of
the
defense.
mr.
john
f.
manning
i
mean,
if
there's
something
in
addition
to
that,
for
example--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--let's
take
a
case
of
a
conspiracy
where--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--that's
right.
we're
saying
that
it
is
per
se
not
prejudice,
that
it
is
not
prejudice
per
se
to
have
inconsistent
or
antagonistic
defenses,
but
that
it
might
be,
in
combination
with
other
factors,
a
factor
to
consider
in
deciding
whether
to
grant
severance.
for
example,
if
you
had
a
trial
and
there
were
40
defendants
and
it
was
a
very
large,
complicated
conspiracy
case,
and
everybody
said,
i'm
sorry,
we're
just
an
importing
company,
we
don't
know
how
this
box
of
cocaine
got
into
our
warehouse,
it
certainly
would
be
possible
for
the
jury
to
consider
a
trial
that
large
given
the
simplicity
of
the
defense.
however,
if
you
had
40
defendants
and
they
were
pointing
to
one
another
and
had
very
complicated
and
antagonistic
defenses,
it
might
be
a
fact...
the
antagonism
might
be
a
factor
for
the
district
court
to
consider
in
determining
whether
the
jury
was
able
to
keep
the
case
straight.
mr.
john
f.
manning
even
if
the
nephew
was
reluctant
to
testify.
well,
there
are
a
number
of
things
that
go
into
the
decision
to
testify,
and
there
are
a
number
of
factors
that--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--we
would.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
that's
exactly
right,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
that's
correct,
and
that--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--not
only
that--
[laughter]
not
only
that,
your
honor,
but
everybody...
it
is
more
accurate
to
say
that
everybody
was
convicted
of
conspiracy,
but
in
fact,
gloria
zafiro
was
acquitted
on
the
three
substantive
counts
of
possession,
which
indicates
that
the
jury
was
perfectly
capable
of
sorting
through
the
evidence
and
applying
it
separately
to
each.
mr.
john
f.
manning
all
of
them
were
convicted
of
at
least
one
offense,
but
that...
they
were
all
convicted
of
conspiracy.
gloria
zafiro
moved
for
severance
later
in
the
trial
after
the
presentation
of
the
evidence.
she
didn't
move
at
the
outset.
she
moved
later.
and
she
was
convicted
of
conspiracy,
but
she
was
acquitted
of
the
substantive
defenses.
mr.
john
f.
manning
the
other
three
were
convicted
of
everything.
that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
manning
that's
right,
justice
o'connor.
we
think
that
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
we
would
point
out
that
since
we
don't
have
a
right
to
appeal
that
point
under
18
u.s.c.
3731,
then
the
practical
import
of
saying
that
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion
is
somewhat
limited
although
that
is
a
reason
i
would
point
out
for
the
court,
if
it
rules
in
our
favor,
to
be
very
clear
in
stating
that
antagonism
alone
is
not
prejudice
within
the
meaning
of
the
rules
so
that
the
district
courts
have
clear
guidance
in
knowing
when
they
can
sever
on
the
basis
of
antagonistic
defenses.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
thank
you,
mr.
manning.
mr.
cunniff,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
