we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-6824,
gloria
zafiro
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
cunniff.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
cunniff.
mr.
cunniff,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cunniff,
let
me
interrupt
you
for
just...
are
all
four
of
these
people
petitioners
here,
zafiro,
martinez,
garcia,
and
soto?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
shift
the
burden
of
proof,
you're
not
talking
in
any
literal
sense,
are
you?
the
judge
still
charges
the
jury
that
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
you're
simply
talking
as
a
practical
matter?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
wrong
with
that
statement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
they
all
refused
to
take
the
stand?
the
government
would
have
no
proof.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
still--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
still
does
to
have
its
case
go
to
the
jury.
as
i
understand
the
criminal
law,
the
government
has
to
have
evidence
that
tends
to
prove
each
of
the
elements
of
the
crime
against
each
defendant
whose...
against
whom
the
case
is
sent
to
the
jury.
nothing
about
the
severance
rules
changes
that,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here
there
was
no
doubt
in
the
world
that
this
big
suitcase
of
cocaine
was
brought
to
the
apartment
by
one
of
these
people.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
there
would
be
a
certain
irony
if...
under
the
facts
that
we
know
about
this
case,
if
all
four
of
these
people
were
acquitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
do
have
to
show
that
the
defendant
is...
it
appears
the
defendant
will
be
prejudiced.
and
wherein
does
the
prejudice
lie
if
you
don't
know
that
the
co-defendant
is
going
to
take
the
stand?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
move
for
a...
you
have
to
move
for
a
severance
long
before
the
trial
starts.
and
so,
am
i
to
take
it
that
generally
at
the
time
you
have
to
move
for
a
severance,
you
don't
know
whether
the
co-defendant
is
going
to
take
the
stand?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
other
parties
who
don't
join
in
the
motion,
but
who...
the
trial
of
who...
against
whom
has
to
start
anew?
wouldn't
they
have
a
double
jeopardy
defense?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
prejudicial
about
having
the
co-defendant
testify
against
your
client?
i
mean,
the
co-defendant
is
testifying
under
oath.
presumably
the
trial
is
a
truth-finding
process.
why
is
that
prejudice,
to
get
testimony
under
oath
even
though
it
hurts
your
client?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he's
not
shifting
the
burden
of
proof
in
any
strict
use
of
those
terms.
he
may
give
an
additional
incentive
to
the
defendant
to
take
the
stand
and
deny
what
the
co-defendant
said.
the
burden
of
proof
remains
on
the
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
difference
between
finger
pointing
and
an
antagonistic
defense?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cunniff.
mr.
manning.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
at
some
point
you
have
to
say
that
a
defendant
who
decides
not
to
testify
because
he
doesn't
want
to
hurt
an
uncle's
feelings,
that's
his
problem,
not
the
government's
problem.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cunniff.
the
case
is
submitted.
