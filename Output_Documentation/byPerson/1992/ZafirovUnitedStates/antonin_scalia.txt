that's
one
scenario.
i
suppose
another
one
is
that
if
you
try
them
separately
and
they
are
both
lying,
each
one
will
be
acquitted,
the
other
one
being
absent
and
declining
to
testify
because
he
might
tend
to
incriminate
himself.

it
looks
like
a
hard
choice.

well,
he'd
have
to
do
that
if
the
co-defendant
weren't
a
co-defendant
and
chose
to
testify.
why
is
that...
you
know,
you
always
have
to
respond
to
people
who
are
making
arguments
against
you.
