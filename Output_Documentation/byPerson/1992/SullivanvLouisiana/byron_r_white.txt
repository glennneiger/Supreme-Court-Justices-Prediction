justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
harmful
only
if
the...
if
there
was
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
convicted
on
less
than
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
you...
you
really...
this
instruction
i
think
you
claim
left
the
jury...
at
least
it's
likely
that
they
convicted
on
less
than
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
the
instruction
permitted
them
to
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
cage.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if...
if
you
make
an...
in
estelle...
you
know
estelle
v.
mcguire.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
says
in
these
kinds
of
cases
you
inquire
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
has
applied
the
challenged
instruction
in
a
way
that
violates
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
sounds
to
me
like
we
were
saying
that
if
there
was
a
reasonable
likelihood,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
there's
no
separate
harmless
error
analysis
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
if
you
conclude
that
there
wasn't
any
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
convicted
on
less
than
reasonable
doubt?
justice
byron
r.
white
there's
no...
then
there
isn't
any
error,
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
harmless
or
otherwise.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
i
would
think
you
would
argue
that
if
cage
holds
that,
which
it
probably
did,
that
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
convicted
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that...
i
would
think
you
would
argue
that
forecloses
any
further
harmless
error
analysis,
and
i
guess
you
do,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
the
state
suggests
that
this
wasn't
an
ambiguous
instruction
at
all,
and
it
wasn't
an
erroneous
one,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
they
do,
but...
i
know
you
think
so,
but
the
state
doesn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right,
they
assert
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
cage
didn't
deal
with
harmless
error.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
didn't
say
that
harmless
error
was
out
of
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
it
seems
to
me
that
a
later
case,
estelle,
indicates
that
if
you
don't
think
that
an
error
in
an
instruction
contributed...
had
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
contributing
to
the
verdict--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
if
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
because
of
the
state
of
the
evidence
that
the
jury
did
not
apply
the
instruction
in
an
unconstitutional
manner?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
assume
that
in
cage,
from
reading
the
per
curiam,
that
there
must
have
been
room
in
the
evidence
to
have
assumed
that
the
jury
could
have
applied
the
instruction
in
an
unconstitutional
manner
and
convicted
on
less
than
reasonable
doubt.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
was
not
permitted
by
the
instruction
to
convict
on
any
less
than
a
reasonable
doubt...
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
really,
you
could
just
argue
that
estelle
answers
the
question
of
whether
or
not--
justice
byron
r.
white
--whether
or
not
a
cage
error
is
subject
to
something
like
harmless
error
analysis.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say,
here's
a
cage
error,
and
you
go
about
it
by
inquiring
whether
or
not
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
it...
that
the
jury
applied...
convicted
on
a
wrong
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
don't
need
to
say
that
this
is
a...
it
wasn't...
you
don't
need
to
say
that
this
was
not
a...
that
this
instruction
was
not
error
under
cage.
all
you
have
to
do
is
say
well,
if
there
was
an
error
under
cage,
it
was
harmless,
and
it's
subject
to
harmless
error
because
estelle
says
it
is.
