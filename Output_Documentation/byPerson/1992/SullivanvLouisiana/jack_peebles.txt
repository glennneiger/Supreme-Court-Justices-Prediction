mr.
jack
peebles
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
louisiana
has
no
quarrel
with
the
defendant's
right
to
a
trial
by
jury,
or
with
his
right
to
have
that
jury
determine
his
guilt
or
innocence,
or
with
his
right
to
have
that
jury
determine
his
guilt
or
innocence
by
a
criterion
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
essence
of
the
difference
between
the
state
and
the
defense
in
this
case
is
over
the
nature
of
the
errors
that
were
committed
by
the
trial
judge
in
giving
his
jury
charge.
i
assure
you
that
the
state
does
not
concede
that
john
sullivan
was
convicted
by
a
standard
of
proof
of
less
than
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
indeed,
our
argument
to
you
today
is
that
a
careful
reading
of
that
jury
charge
indicates
that
he
was
not
convicted
by
a
jury
charge--
mr.
jack
peebles
--yes.
mr.
jack
peebles
you
are
not
bound,
your
honor,
because
of
estelle
v.
mcguire.
in
1990,
in
teague
v.
louisiana,
this
court
considered
a
jury
charge
similar
to
the
one
we
have
today,
and
in
cage
this
court
held
that
a
reasonable
juror
could
have
interpreted
the
instruction
to
allow
a
finding
of
guilt
based
on
a
degree
of
proof
below
that
required
by
the
due
process
clause.
but
it's
important
to
note
that
in
cage
the
court
said
that
in
construing
the
instruction,
we
consider
how
reasonable
jurors
could
have
understood
the
charge
as
a
whole.
you
used
the
language,
how
they
could
have
understood
it,
and
you
said
that
because
there
was
a
possibility
that
they
could
have
understood
the
language
in
the
jury
charge
to
reduce
the
burden
of
proof
standard
below
that
allowed
by
the
due
process
clause,
you
held
that
mr.
cage
was
entitled
to
a
new
trial.
now,
later,
in
estelle
v.
mcguire,
you
specifically
explicitly
disapproved
the
standard
used
in
cage.
you
explicitly
said,
in
estelle
v.
mcguire,
we
now
disapprove
the
standard
of
review
language
in
cage
and
yates
and
reaffirm
the
standard
set
out
in
boyde.
mr.
jack
peebles
well,
i'm
recasting
the...
if
that's
the
way
the
petitioner
posed
the
question,
but--
mr.
jack
peebles
--we
are
suggesting
to
the
court
that
the
review
of
the
louisiana
supreme
court's
decision
on
harmless
error
is
appropriately
before
this
court
and
should
be
considered
in
light
of
the
estelle
v.
mcguire
criteria.
mr.
jack
peebles
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
if
the
court
limits
it
that
way.
mr.
jack
peebles
however,
in
rendering
the...
granting
the
certiorari,
you
did
not
say,
we
are
limiting
the
question
in
any
particular
manner.
mr.
jack
peebles
no,
your
honor--
mr.
jack
peebles
--we
did
not.
we
do
think
it's
an
appropriate
question
for
this
court.
however,
it's
not
relevant
for
this
particular
case
because,
as
i
said,
in
the
later
case
of
estelle
v.
mcguire,
you
changed
the
criterion
by
which
such
jury
charges--
mr.
jack
peebles
--we
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor.
the
reason
we
are
addressing
it
in
this
manner
is
that
we
are...
the
petitioner
here
is
seeking
review
of
the
finding
of
harmless
error
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
the
actual
analysis
of
that
error
we
did
not
figure
was
limited
to
that
which
was
submitted
by
the
petitioner
in
his
brief.
that's
the
reason
we
were
proceeding
as
we
are
here
today.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor,
if
you
choose,
that's
of
course
your
prerogative,
but
you
have
changed
the
rule
in
cage.
you
have
changed
the
criterion
by
which
ambiguous
jury
charges
are
considered,
so
that
the
state
respectfully
submits
that
that
would
be
a
moot
point
at
this
point.
the
question
now
is
whether
the
jury
charge
that
was
given
in--
mr.
jack
peebles
--that's
what
we
are
suggesting
to
the
court.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor,
we
are
suggesting--
mr.
jack
peebles
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
what
we're
suggesting
to
the
court,
that
in
this
case
a
review
of
the
charge
shows
that
the
jury
did
not
convict
on
the
wrong
standard.
mr.
jack
peebles
your
honor,
if
there
was
error
under
cage,
and
if
you
do
not...
if
you
hold
that
the
error
was
as
stated
in
cage
and
do
not
apply
estelle
v.
mcguire's
criterion,
then
i
think
that
this
would
not
be
an
error
which
would
be
subject
to
the
harmless
error
rule,
because
in
cage,
the
court
decided
that
the
posture
of
the
case
was
such
that
the
defendant
was
denied
a
fundamental
right.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor,
i
did.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor,
it
does,
and
we...
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
jack
peebles
if...
once
you
conclude
that
the
jury
charge
did
reduce
the
level
of
the
burden
of
proof
instruction
to
that
below
that
which
is
allowed
by
the
due
process
clause,
then
we
submit
that
you
cannot
subject
such
an
error
to
the
harmless
error
rule--
mr.
jack
peebles
--that
would
be
the
end
of
the
ball
game,
yes.
mr.
jack
peebles
well--
mr.
jack
peebles
--your
honor,
as
i
understand,
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
the
harmless...
whether
the
error
committed
by
the
trial
judge
is
harmless,
or
can
be
harmless,
and
we're
prepared
to
argue
that
question.
we
do
not
want
to
argue
something
that
we
feel
is
not
correct
under
law.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
portions
of
the
instruction
were
incorrect.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jack
peebles
well,
it
was
error
in
that
it
misdescribed
to
an
extent
what
reasonable
doubt
is.
we
submit,
however,
that
the
nature
of
that
error
is
such
that
it
does
not
reduce
the
burden
of
proof
level
unconstitutionally.
it
simply
enters
a
degree
of
vagueness
or
confusion
into
the
jury
charge.
mr.
jack
peebles
yes.
mr.
jack
peebles
we're
saying
that
under
the
criterion
of
estelle
v.
mcguire,
it
is
not
error.
mr.
jack
peebles
well,
your
honor,
the
other
side
of
that
argument
would
be
that
in
this
particular
case
the
entire
record
before
the
court
was
complete.
no
evidence
was
omitted,
no
issues
were
omitted,
this
court
can
analyze
the
issues
and
the
evidence,
and
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
there
was
overwhelming
evidence
of
guilt
in
this
case.
mr.
jack
peebles
well,
we
know
that
the
jury
did
find
that
he
was
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
question
is
whether
the
jury--
mr.
jack
peebles
--had
before
it
the
proper
criteria.
mr.
jack
peebles
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that,
again,
brings
us
back
to
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
that
instruction
correctly
told
the
jury
what
it
must
find
in
order
to
evaluate
the
evidence.
mr.
jack
peebles
no,
your
honor--
mr.
jack
peebles
--it
could
not
have
been.
i'm
sure
under
jackson
v.
virginia
the
court
has
said
as
much,
and
in
fact,
if
the
jury--
mr.
jack
peebles
--if
the
instruction
is
erroneous
but
nonetheless
does
not
reduce
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reason...
to
that
which
is
not
permitted
by
the
due
process
clause,
then
the
mistake
would
be
harmless.
that's
essentially
what
we're
arguing
in
this
case,
your
honor,
that
those
words
about...
which
have
been
criticized
do
not
cause
the
charge
to
become
unconstitutional.
mr.
jack
peebles
that's
correct.
mr.
jack
peebles
that's
correct,
your
honor,
it
does.
if
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i'll
be
glad
to
answer
them.
mr.
jack
peebles
thank
you.
