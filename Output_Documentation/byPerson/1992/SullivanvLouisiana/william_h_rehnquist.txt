chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
92-5129,
john
sullivan
v.
louisiana.
mr.
reed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
reed,
what
was
the
disposition
made
by
the
supreme
court
of
louisiana
of
the
sentence
imposed
on
sullivan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
mr.
reed,
in
most
states...
i
don't
know
if
it's
true
in
louisiana
or
not...
the
defendant
simply
enters
a
plea
of
not
guilty.
you
don't
deny
the
allegations,
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
indictment,
and
so
the
situation
which
you
advert
to
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
where
the
defendant
relies
only
on
affirmative
defense
would
be
a
purely
fictional
one.
i
mean,
a
defendant
can
always
say
he's
just
putting
the
government
to
its
proof,
can't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
look
to
see
if
he
was
relying
on
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wouldn't
a
not-guilty
plea
ordinarily
be
conclusive
for
the
defendant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
your
view,
then,
a
defendant
would
have
to
show
something
more
than
just
a
not-guilty
plea.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course,
that
kind
of
argument
was
made
against
a
whole
notion
of
harmless
error
when
it
was
first
introduced,
but
courts
can't
second-guess
juries.
we
never
know
what
a
jury
would
have
done
had
this
evidence
been
brought
before
it,
even
though
rational
people
would
have
said
it
didn't
make
much
difference,
but
that
line
of
argument
was
rejected
for
the
great
majority
of
harmless
error
applications
saying
that
the
principle
of
harmless
error
was
applicable.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
that
we
flesh
out
a
little
bit
justice
o'connor's
hypothesis
and
say
that
there
were
four
eyewitnesses,
each
to
a
murder
with
which
the
defendant
is
charged.
each
of
them
is
grilled
extensively
by
defense
counsel,
and
it
only
firms
up
the
witness'
account...
those
things
do
happen,
as
you
know.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
defense...
defendant
does
not
take
the
stand.
defendant
puts
on
a
couple
of
alibi
witnesses
who
are
simply
made
mincemeat
of
by
the
prosecution,
and...
but
there
is
this
kind
of
flaw
in
the
reasonable
doubt
instruction.
your
argument
is
that
even
in
that
extreme
a
case
there's
no
possibility
for
harmless
error.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you
must
do,
and
you're
certainly
making
arguments
to
that
effect...
perhaps
you've
succeeded...
is
to
show
why
this
reasonable
doubt
instruction
is
so
much
different
from
the
other
kinds
of
instructions
that
we
do
allow
harmless
error
review,
such
as
a
sandstrom
error.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
the
basis
of
the
winship
opinion
and
the
successors
to
it,
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
jury
trial,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
basing
your
argument
on
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
jury
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
reed.
mr.
peebles,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
right.
usually
our
rule
is,
mr.
peebles,
that
if
things
like
this
are
not
brought
up
in
the
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari,
we
grant
the
case
expecting
to
decide
the
question
that's
presented
by
the
petition,
and
you've
a
right
under
the
rules
to
argue
an
alternat
ground
for
affirmance,
or
something
like
that,
but
we
expect
to
address
the
question
that's
presented
in
the
petition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
mean
in
any
way
to
suggest
that
other
arguments
are
foreclosed
to
you,
but
one
argument
you
can
expect
the
court
to
consider
i
think,
because
of
the
way
the
question
presented
is
phrased,
is,
is
harmless
error
analysis
applicable
to
an
instruction
that
violates
the
rule
of
cage?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
peebles,
i
don't
think
you're
performing
the
responsibility
you
ought
to
perform
before
the
court.
when
we
grant
certiorari
on
a
particular
question,
we
expect
it
to
be
argued
adversarially.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
don't
decide
cases
on
concessions
by
the...
of
the
principal
point
presented
by
the
petition
for
certiorari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
the
question
presented,
and
i'm
sure
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do,
is
whether
a
constitutionally
deficient
reasonable
doubt
instruction
can
be
found
harmless
error.
now,
i
think
you
have
to
accept
by
hypothesis
that
this
particular
instruction
was
constitutionally
deficient,
or
you've
at
least
got
to
argue
before
us
whether
or
not
it
was...
can
be
found
to
be
harmless
error,
and
we
expect
you
to
argue
the
other
side
of
that
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
peebles.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
reed,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
reed.
the
case
is
submitted.
