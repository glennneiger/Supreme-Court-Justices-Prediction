david
h.
souter
well,
aren't
we
bound
to
assume
there
was
cage
error?
aren't
you
telling
us
that
we
don't
assume
there
was
cage
error?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
peebles,
i
apologize,
but
i
would
like
to
interrupt
you.
i
pulled
out
the
petition
for
cert
in
this
case,
and
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
cert
is
this:
is
a
reasonable
doubt
instruction
which
is
constitutionally
deficient
under
cage
v.
louisiana
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis?
that's
the
only
question
we
took,
and
you
are
in
effect
recasting
the
question
for
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
we
stick
to
the
question
we
took,
your
argument
is
beside
the
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me--
justice
david
h.
souter
--did
you...
in
the
brief
in
opposition
did
you
state
that
the
question
was
inappropriate?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
think
that's
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--excuse
me,
but
you
did
not
tell
us
this
in
your
brief
in
opposition.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
effect
that's
an
argument
that
there
was
a
sufficiency
of
evidence
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
is
not
an
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
that
the
jury
did
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
did
not
find--
justice
david
h.
souter
--excuse
me.
it
did
not
find
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
accordance
with
an
instruction
correctly
describing
the
reasonable
doubt
standard.
