mr.
reed,
what
is
the
difference
between
other
kinds
of
errors
in
the
jury
instruction
and
this
one?
suppose
a
jury
instruction
is
inadequate
because
it
incorrectly
defines
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense?
would
that
always
be
a
basis
for
automatically
setting
it
aside?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying,
given
one
jury
finding
you
can
say
well,
it's
inevitable
that
a
jury
that
found
this
would
find
the
other,
but
in
this
case
you
have
no
jury
finding--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
therefore
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
no
fulcrum
for
the
lever,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
not
error,
then,
you're
saying.
