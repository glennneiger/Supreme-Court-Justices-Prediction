justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
reed,
if
there
were
a
case
in
which
the
evidence
were
just
crystal
clear...
there's
a
confession
by
the
defendant,
there
are
five
eyewitnesses
who
testified,
there
are
finger
print
evidence
and
so
forth,
no
one
could
disagree
that
the
evidence
is
overwhelming...
is
it
possible
in
such
a
case
that
an
appellate
court
could
review
it
and
conclude
that
no
reasonable
juror
would
have
been
able
to
do
anything
but
find
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
rely
on
the
right
of
the
jury
to
nullify
any
verdicts--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--any
juror
could--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
any
reason--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
peebles,
did
the
state
concede
before
the
louisiana
supreme
court
that
the
jury
instruction
on
reasonable
doubt
was
erroneous?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
i
thought
that
had
been
the
concession
below--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
that
we
would
just
take
it
on
the
same
concession
here.
it
was
error.
now,
what
can
be
done
about
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
peebles,
what
if
no
instruction
had
been
given
at
all
on
burden
of
proof
in
a
criminal
case,
just
no
instruction?
now,
could
that
be
harmless?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
then,
how
would
you
have
a
different
result
if
the
instruction
that
is
given
is
erroneous
and
doesn't
present
the
right
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
takes
you
back
to
your
same
argument
that
there's
just
no
constitutional
violation--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--by
virtue
of
the
instruction.
