mr.
john
wilson
reed
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
state
of
louisiana
undertook
to
charge
and
accuse
john
sullivan
with
murder,
john
sullivan
had
the
right
to
have
the
truth
of
that
accusation
determined
by
a
jury
and
to
have
the
truth
of
that
accusation
determined
by
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
when
the
state
of
louisiana
at
trial
undertook
to
prove
that
accusation
by
reliance
on
a
professed
accomplice,
possibly
beaten
by
the
police
at
the
time
of
his
arrest
in
return
for
his
original
statement,
held
in
jail
for
2
years
until
the
day
of
trial,
and
promised
his
freedom,
his
immunity,
and
his
release
upon
his
giving
testimony
in
this
case,
john
sullivan
had
the
right
to
have
the
credibility
of
that
witness,
in
light
of
the
other
evidence
of
the
case,
tested
and
determined
by
a
jury,
and
tested
and
determined
by
a
jury
by
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
john
sullivan
did
not
receive
that
right.
3
years
ago,
this
court
held
in
cage
v.
louisiana
that
john
sullivan
had
not
received
that
right.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
below
held
that
john
sullivan
had
not
received
that
right,
and
below
the
state
conceded
that
john
sullivan
had
not
received
the
right
to
a
jury's
determination
by
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
because
the
jury
instruction
provided
that
a
jury
could
convict
not
only
on
a
standard
of
proof
lower
than
that
required
by
due
process
but
by
a
standard...
on
a
standard
of
jury
certainty
below
that
required
by
due
process.
so
john
sullivan
comes
before
this
court
on
direct
appeal,
on
a
conviction
of
murder,
still
subject
in
further
proceedings,
to
the
possibility
of
a
sentence
of
death,
without
what
this
court
has
called
in
herrera
a
judgment
of
legal
guilt.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
your
honor,
vacated
the
sentence
of
death
on
the
grounds
that
mr.
sullivan's
attorney
had
been
ineffective
in
his
representation
during
the
penalty
phase
and
leaves
to
further
proceedings
the
possibility
of
reimposing
that.
presumably
there
will
be
a
new
sentencing
proceeding,
and
would
be
in
the
absence
of
action
by
this
court.
the
jury
in
this
case
was
not
asked
the
right
question.
the
question
to
be
asked
of
a
jury
in
a
criminal
trial
is
whether
the
defendant
is
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
whether
the
jurors
possess
that
subjective
certainty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
the
jury
not
having
been
asked
the
right
question,
necessarily
the
jury
by
its
verdict
cannot
be
said
to
have
answered
that
question.
the
jury
did
not
answer
that
question,
and
so
the
case
went
before
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
where
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
acknowledging
the
error,
answered
the
question
itself,
and
that
is
what
the
sixth
amendment
prohibits
courts
from
doing
by
an
application
of
an
ordinary
kind
of
harmless
error
test,
which
i
would
suggest
was
not
applied
in
any
way
that
could
be
considered
correct
in
this
case
in
any
event.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
made
its
own
findings
of
credibility
on
a
cold
record,
disregarded
the
testimony
the
bartender
eyewitness
lowrey,
and
instead
rested
its...
its
conclusion
on
the
testimony
of
the
accomplice,
hillhouse,
finding
that
the
testimony
of
that
accomplice
was
unrefuted.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
your
honor
asks,
of
course,
the
hardest
question,
and
i
think
the
principal
answer
to
that
question,
in
light
of
the
sixth
amendment,
has
to
be
no,
so
long
as
the
defendant
was
in
fact
relying
on
the
jury's
finding
of
facts
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
no.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
no,
i
do
not
rely
on
jury
nullification.
i
think
that
that
lurks
in
the
background
here,
but
that
is
not
an
express
part
of
our
argument
at
all.
in
a
case
such
as
the
one
your
honor
suggested,
if
there
were
defenses
that
were
raised
by
a
defendant
perhaps
of
self-defense,
perhaps
of
justification,
perhaps
the
patterson
v.
new
york
kind
of
defense,
the
defense
of
insanity,
the
defendant
not
only
confesses
but
gets
on
the
witness
stand
and
admits
the
elements
of
the
offense,
then
i
would
suggest
you
could
apply
a
harmless
error
analysis
because
in
those
cases
the
reasonable
doubt
fact-finding
process
might
not
be
relied
upon
by
the
defendant.
he
might
be
relying
on
some
affirmative
defense
determined
by
a
different
standard,
but
i
think
principle
requires
that
in
your
honor's
case
that
the
sixth
amendment
prohibit
a
finding
of
harmless
error
if
the
defendant
is
indeed
submitting
questions
of
fact
to
the
jury
by
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
may
be
that
there
are
such
obvious
cases.
they
will
be
very
few,
i
would
think,
and
even
when
you
see
cases
where
things
are
on
videotape,
nevertheless
people
and
juries
and
lawyers
advocating
cases
to
juries--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--if
the
defendant
is,
indeed,
your
honor,
putting
the
government
to
its
proof
on
the
elements
of
the
offense
and
requiring
it
to
prove
them
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
then
we
would
suggest
that
you
cannot
apply
harmless
error
in
the
ordinary
way,
but
must
instead
look
to
see
whether
he
was
relying
on
it
and
if
he
was
then
it
cannot
be
harmless.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
on
the...
on
the
obligation
of
the
state
or
the
government
to
prove
beyond
a...
if
he
made
in
opening
statements
for
your
honor,
the
defendant
comes
before
you,
admits
he
killed
so-and-so,
admits
he
intentionally
killed
so-and-so,
but
tells
you
that
he
was
insane
at
the
time,
then
i
think
a
court
could
conclude
that
that
defendant
was
not
relying
on
facts
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
if
the
insanity
defense
was
placed...
the
burden
was
placed--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--well,
initially
a
not-guilty
plea
would
certainly
be
the
first
step,
and
if
that's
all
there
were
before
you,
you
might
reach
that
conclusion,
but
when
you
review
it
there
is
much
more
before
you
than
just
a
not-guilty
plea.
there's
the
opening
statements,
there's
the
evidence,
there's
the
closing
arguments,
and
you
can
determine
whether
this
is
a
case
in
which
a
defendant
indeed
was
putting
the
government
to
its
test
to
persuade
a
jury
fact-finder--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--no,
your
honor.
i
would
be
obliged
to
say
that
if
a
defendant
pled
not
guilty
and
required
the
government
to
go
through
its
proof
and
you
could
not
ascertain
from
opening
statements
or
closing
arguments
that
there
was
reliance...
that
there
was
not
reliance
on
the
rule
requiring
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
in
that
rare
circumstance,
if
you
didn't
find
counsel
ineffective
or
lots
of
other
problems
along
the
way,
in
that
rare
circumstance
you
would
have
to
find
harmless
error.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--as
i
would
see
it,
only
this,
and
the
reason
why
is
because
in
every
other
circumstance
that
i
can
contemplate,
if
there
is
an
instruction
on
reasonable
doubt
there
will
be
before
a
reviewing
court
some
findings
of
the
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
assume
three
elements,
a
misinstruction
that
fails
on
one,
a
guilty
verdict...
there
are
findings
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
two
elements.
you
may
logically,
you
may
not,
but
you
can
apply
it
analytically,
say
that
having
proved
a
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
there
may
be
such
an
necessary
inexorable
connection
between
a
and
b
that
we
can
say
as
a
matter
of
law
that
it
was
harmless
error,
that
there
was
a
failure
of
instruction
on
b.
that
is
somewhat
what
was
done
in
pope,
it's
somewhat
what
has
been
done
in
the
presumption
cases.
here,
instead
of
having
a
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
what
can
we
say
about
b
or
c,
you
have
nothing
that
a
jury
has
said
to
have
been
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
you
have
no
anchor
against
which
to
conduct
harmless
error
analysis,
and
that
is
the
distinction
between
this
and
all
other
instructions.
they
might
come
out
differently
in
the
analysis,
but
you
can
subject
them
to
the
analysis.
here
you
cannot.
i
would,
if
you
will,
go
back
to
the
language
of
the
harmless
error
rule,
something
that
you
can
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
did
not
contribute
to
the
verdict,
something
that
you
can
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that's
chapman,
or
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
did
not
affect
the
fact-finding
process,
that's
van
arsdale.
how
can
something
not
contribute
to
the
verdict
when
it
defines
the
verdict,
it
defines
the
question
the
jury
was
asked
and
the
answer
that
it
gave,
it...
in
terms
of...
it
affects
the
fact-finding
process,
it
defines
the
process
they
went
through
and,
therefore,
how
can
you
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
it
was
harmless
when
it
defines
it?
so
in
a
sense
you
can--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--well,
because,
your
honor--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
this
court
so
found,
and
the
question--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--in
cage,
your
honor,
yes,
and
this
is
a
virtually
identical
instruction,
so
this
court
has
held
that
that's
what
this
instruction
does.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
yes,
sir--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
semantics,
your
honor.
i
could
say
there
is
no
harmless
error
analysis,
period,
because
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
it
affected
because
reasonable
doubt
was
in
pope--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--or
you
could
say
it
the
other
way.
i
think
the
result
is
the
same
either
way.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
well,
i
think--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--but
i
think
cage--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--cage
defines
that
there
is
such
error.
there
is
the
dispute
about
the
language,
but
the
cage
instruction
is
not
an
ambiguous
instruction,
your
honor,
and
the
terms
v.
franklin,
boyde,
mcguire--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--i
certainly
do,
your
honor.
i
only
mean
to
consider
some
remote
possibilities
where
it
might
not
apply,
or
not
so
remote,
but
as
long
as
the
ordinary
criminal
case
like
john
sullivan,
relying
on
the
state's
requirement
to
prove
the
elements
against
him,
defending
on
the
basis
principally
of
identity,
that
that
is
the
seminal...
the
key
thing
that
a
jury
decides,
and
given
that
instruction,
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
they
could,
they
would,
they
did.
it
was
a
clear
instruction
before
them
that
said
they
only
had
to
convict
when
they
were
convinced
to
a
grave
uncertainty,
not
when
they
were
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
i
think,
your
honor,
cage
settles
that
question.
that
is,
what--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--well,
they
take...
they
do
take
dispute--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--they
do,
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that...
i
think
the
strength
and
the
clarity
of
the
cage
opinion
is
in
its
unanimity,
in
the
language
of
the
opinion
in
which
the
court
says
it
is
plain
to
us
that
the
words
mean
something
less
than
reasonable
doubt,
all
nine
members
of
this
court,
and
it
is
clear
to
us
that
a
jury
could.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
this
court's
interpretation
in
cage
is
that
this
is
not
an
ambiguous
instruction,
it's
a
completely
misleading
one
that
dilutes
the
standard
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
would
note
that
the
words
are
identical.
there's
some
dispute
about
grave
doubt,
grave
uncertainty.
in
fact,
the
words
"grave
uncertainty"
are
used
in
both
instructions.
the
courts
of
the
country
for
the
last
3
years
have
been
following
cage
and
take
it
to
mean
what
it
says.
what
the
louisiana
supreme
court
did
could
not
be
defended
under
any
basis
of
reasonable
doubt
analysis,
because
it
is
their
own
fact-finding,
and
i
would
suggest
if
you
ever
try
a
mode
of
approach
to
apply
a
factual
harmless
error
analysis,
a
whole
record
approach,
you
would
conclude
that
you
became
jurors
yourselves
arguing
about
it,
because
if
you
had
to
approach
it
in
any
kind
of
a
way,
you
would
have
to
consider
whether
it
was
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
no
rational
juror
could
have
held
a
reasonable
doubt.
and
once
you
start
considering
those
possibilities,
i
think
i
could
convince
a
majority
of
this
court
that
a
rational
juror
could
have
a
rational...
a
reasonable
doubt,
not
only
on
the
cold
record
but
looking
at
the
way
mr.
hillhouse
scowled,
or
did
he
scowl,
or
did
he
sneer,
or
did
he
look
down,
or
how
did
he
look
when
he
said
the
things
he
said
and
when
he
came
back
on
rebuttal
to
add
more
things
and
more
elements
to
the
state's
proof?
so
when
you
try
to
start
getting
into
that
process,
even
in
justice
o'connor's
extreme
case,
you
start...
lawyers
have
defenses,
clients
have
defenses,
you
can
argue
about
them,
you
can
consider
what
the
possibilities
are
as
they
testify
and
as
they
present
themselves,
and
the
constitution
refers,
defers,
and
reserves
the
decision
of
the
credibility
of
those
witnesses
to
a
jury.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
and
in
every
case,
your
honor,
it
was
rejected,
and
in
every
case
harmless
error
analysis
was
conducted
in
light
of
and
because
there
was
before
the
court
a
jury
finding
of
something
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
that
jury's
certainty,
and
while
i
don't
dispute
that
there
may
be
some
subjectivity
that
might
go
into
the
harmless
error
process
of
adding
and
subtracting
to
that,
there
is
the
integrity
of
a
jury
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
yes.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
no
possibility
that
the
court
in
that
extreme
a
case
could
direct
a
verdict,
your
honor,
no
possibility
in
that
extreme
a
case
that
the
court
could
set
aside
a
jury's
verdict
of
acquittal,
and
no
possibility,
therefore,
in
terms
of
the
sixth
amendment
applying
harmless
error
in
that
kind
of
a
case.
if
the
principle
allows
this
court
to
declare
the
man
guilty
because
the
witnesses
are
that
powerful
against
him
that
we
can
so
declare
it
even
though
a
jury
has
never
found
it,
then
that
is
saying
that
we
do
not
need
the
jury
in
the
first
place,
and
it
means
that
the
reasonable
doubt
decision
is
reserved
to--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--well,
i
think
the...
with
the...
again,
with
the
reasonable
doubt
instruction
you
have
the
jury
finding.
without
it,
you
do
not.
with
it,
you
have
deference
to
the
jury.
without
it,
you
have
no
deference
to
the
jury,
and
that,
i
think
is
the
distinction
between
the
two,
and
the
jury
must
be
allowed
to
make
those
decisions,
no
matter
how
extreme
the
case.
no,
i'm
not
relying
on--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--correct.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
you're
at
sea.
you're
lost.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
nothing
to
hold
on
to,
nothing
to
hang
your
hat
on.
you're
just...
i
mean,
if
i'm
certain
of
a,
you
can
say
logically
that
i
declare
myself
to
be
certain
of
a,
b
must
follow.
i
mean,
if
you
ask
me
right
now
whether
i'm
certain
i
turned
the
stove
off
this
morning,
i'll
say
yes,
i'm
sure,
but
you
don't
know
how
sure
i
am,
and
if
you're
going
to
say,
well,
mr.
reed
was
sure
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that's
because
you
will
be
making
that
decision
and
you
will
be
assessing
those
facts,
and
you
will
be
making
those
determinations,
and
that's
what
the
sixth
amendment
says
that
courts
cannot
do,
and
it
says
that
courts
cannot
do
for
reasons
that
are
among
the
most
fundamental.
i
mean,
cross-examination
is
a
nice
right
for
a
defendant,
self-incrimination
is
a
nice
right,
subpoenaing
witnesses
is
a
nice
right,
but
the
right
to
jury
trial
has
something
to
do
with
apportionment
of
decision-making
power,
the
structure--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--no,
your
honor.
the
winship
opinion
is
based
on
the
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
due
process
and
right
to
that
measure
of
certainty.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
i
think
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
jury
trial
forecloses
the
application
of
harmless
error
analysis
in
any
customary
form
where
a
defendant
is
relying
on
the
reasonable
doubt
instruction,
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
there
is
more
to
the
argument
than
just
the
right
to
trial
by
jury,
and
that
is
that
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
somebody
is...
a
defendant
is
entitled
not
to
be
convicted
except
upon
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
fact-finder.
that's
part
of
the
winship
formulation.
it
is
the
subjective
degree
of
certainty
of
the
fact-finder.
the
opinions
are
the
intensity
of
belief
of
the
fact-finder.
reasonable
doubt
is
not
just
a
measuring
yardstick
of
the
quantum
of
evidence.
as
it
was
emphasized
in
jackson
v.
virginia
in
both
the
majority
opinion
and
in
the
dissent,
reasonable
doubt
is
about
the
certainty
of
the
fact-finder.
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
i
have
the
right
to
the
certainty
of
the
fact-finder.
as
a
matter
of
sixth
amendment...
of
the
sixth
amendment,
i
have
the
right
for
that
fact-finder
to
be
a
jury
and
none
other.
if
you
go
back
to
duncan,
duncan
speaks
of
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
the
jury's
verdict.
the
verdict
is
what
a
defendant
has
a
right
to.
the
verdict
by
definition
is
speaking
the
truth,
the
telling
of
the
truth,
the
truth
of
the
accusation.
truth
is
determined
by
the
standard
of
reasonable
doubt,
and
what
you're
entitled
to
from
the
jury
is
the
jury's
determination
of
truth
by
that
standard...
the
truth
of
the
application...
and
that
is
the
structural,
the
fundamental,
structural
role
of
a
jury.
and
in
a
case
like
this
it
is
more
telling
than
ever,
because
you
have
a
witness
essentially
created
by
the
government,
clothed
with
various
immunities
by
the
government,
and
it
should
be
the
citizenry
who
will
determine
whether
that
is
a
witness
who
should
be
believed
and
not
judges,
who
do
not
bring
quite
the
same
approach
to
those
kind
of
fact-finding
decisions
and,
whether
they
do
or
not,
are
not
constitutionally
permitted
to
make
those
kind
of
fact-finding
conclusions
on
a
cold
record
or,
really,
otherwise
when
a
defendant
asserts
his
right
to
trial
by
jury.
you
know,
there's
been
the
evolution
of
the
presumption
cases
and
the
pope
case
and
the
discussion
of
how
you
can
perform
harmless
error
analysis
with
instructional
errors,
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
connecticut
v.
johnson
and
rose
v.
clark,
and
justice
powell's
opinions
in
those
two
cases
and
their
evolution
through
carella
and
through
yates
v.
evatt,
the
thread
that
holds
that
all
together
and
is
always
paid
respect
to
is
reasonable
doubt,
a
jury
finding
something
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
everybody
in
connecticut
v.
johnson
and
rose
v.
clark
agreed
that
the
reasonable
doubt
was
the
touchstone
to
any
performing
of
a
harmless
error
analysis.
so
i
would,
your
honors,
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
saying
again
that
you
cannot
review
the
facts
to
find
whether
this
error
is
harmless.
john
sullivan
is
entitled
to
a
jury's
determination
whether
he's
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
cage
does
not
deal
with
harmless
error,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
as
i
read--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--as
i
read
estelle,
it's
whether
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
has
applied,
and
you...
there
is
a--
mr.
john
wilson
reed
--you
can
only
assume
that
the
jury
applies
the
instructions
as
the
words...
as
the
words
are
meant.
the
words
may
have
a
clear
meaning,
this
court
held
in
cage,
and
i
suggest
they
do.
having
been
asked
that
question,
the
jury
can't
have
answered
any
other.
you
might
wonder
how
they
could
have
applied
it,
or
whether
they
in
fact
had
a
greater
certainty.
indeed,
they
may
have.
i
do
not
know.
the
court
does
not
know.
they
were
not
asked,
and
they
did
not
tell
us.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
they
can
at
any
time,
your
honor,
but
the
facts
in
cage
were
where
two
witnesses...
where
two
witnesses
testified
that
the
defendant
went
up
to
a
body
as
it
was
lying
on
the
ground
and
fired
bullets
into
the
back
of
the
head
at
point-blank
range,
and
there
was
no
question
of
identity,
so
i
don't
think...
i
think
the
court
was
looking
at
the
language
and
at
the
principle,
and
the
harmless
error
principle
requires
that
we
cannot
apply
that
kind
of
analysis.
thank
you.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
your
honors,
there
was
one
way
to
apply
the
cage
instruction.
it
was
to
permit
a
conviction
on
less
than
reasonable
doubt.
there
is
necessarily
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
it
was
applied
in
that
way.
as
necessarily,
therefore,
they
were
asked
the
wrong
question
and
answer
and,
necessarily,
we
can't
apply
harmless
error,
because
we
would
thereby
be
substituting
our
judgment
for
theirs,
which
was
not
given
and
was
not
properly
asked.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
the
case.
mr.
john
wilson
reed
thank
you.
