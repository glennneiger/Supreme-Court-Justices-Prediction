mr.
peebles,
i
may
not
be
following
the
argument
here,
i
must
confess.
i...
in
your
defense,
you
did
in
your
brief
in
opposition
call
our
attention
to
estelle
v.
mcguire
and
the
fact
that
it
in
effect
changed
the
standard
to
some
extent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did
call
that
to
our
attention,
but
if
the
instruction
uses
grave
uncertainty
in
a
way
that
is
a
lesser
standard
of
proof
than
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
if
one
reads
it
that
way,
then
does
it
not
necessarily
follow
under
the
language
in
estelle
that
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
applied
the
challenge
instruction
literally
and
therefore
in
a
way
that
violates
the
constitution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
therefore
that
there's
no
room
for
harmless
error,
once
you
find
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game.
