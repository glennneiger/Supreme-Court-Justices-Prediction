justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
daly,
even
on
your
theory
of
sort
of
the
implicit
understanding
that
you
find
inherent
in
just
the
relationship
between
the
investigator
who
identifies
himself
as
such
and
the
subject,
aren't
there
two
possible
implicit
understandings
in
the
absence
of
anything
explicit
to
the
contrary?
one
may
be
that
yeah,
i'm
talking
to
the
fbi
about
a
matter
which
it
would
be
very
dangerous
to
talk
about,
and
i
may
assume
that
if
they
talk
with
them
they're
not
going
to
spill
the
beans
on
me,
but
the
other
understand
proceeds,
doesn't
it,
from
the
fact
that
most
people
realize
that
the
government
prosecutes
crime
in
open
courtrooms.
and
if
you
give
evidence
to
the
fbi
which
tends
to
incriminate,
isn't
it
reasonable
to
suppose
that
you
are
quite
likely
going
to
be
called
to
give
that
same
kind
of
evidence
in
a
courtroom,
and
how...
on
your
theory
we
ignore
the
second
category,
and
i
don't
see
how
we
can
ignore
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--even
on
your
theory
of
implicit
understanding.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
are,
but
they're
never...
on
your...
maybe
i
misunderstand
your
position,
but
as
i
understand
it,
on
your
position
the
possibility
of
there
being
a
lesser
degree
of
confidentiality
implicit
with
respect
to
a
given
witness
is
in
all
probability
never
going
to
be
known
or
investigated.
i
mean,
how
are...
if
the
burden
is
on
the
claimant
for
the
information
to
say
well,
i
ought
to
know
who
this
is,
because
this
is
probably
a
person
who
would
have
understand
that
he
might
have
to
testify,
how
is
that
person
going
to
make
that
case,
on
your
view?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he
could
have,
but
if
he
doesn't
say...
if
he
says
something,
then
you're
not
resting
on
implication.
he
says,
i
don't
want
to
get
involved,
and
the
agent
says,
don't
worry,
you
won't
have
to
be,
just
tell
me
what
you
know,
then
you're
not
resting
on
your
implication,
but
if
the
person
says
nothing,
i
suppose
it's
reasonable
to
expect
that
the
individual
knew
that
he
might
have
to
give
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
i'm
still
left
with
the
problem
that
i
raised,
and
that
is,
on
your
theory
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
the
claimant
for
the
information
is
ever
going
to
be
in
a
very
good
position
to
say,
oh,
well,
this
is
a
person...
we
offer
to
prove,
for
example,
that
this
is
a
person
who
would
not
have
reasonably
expected
confidentiality.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
at
least
in
that
case
you
would
have
a
perfectly
good
argument
for
your
degree
of
confidentiality.
you
would
say,
well,
the
confidentiality
at
least
extends
beyond
that
point
which
came
out
in
testimony,
so
you
would
have
an
easy
way
of
applying
your
criterion
that
there
are
degrees
of
confidentiality,
and
that
degree
would
be
determined
by
the
extent
to
which
the
confidentiality
was
invaded
by
public
testimony.
