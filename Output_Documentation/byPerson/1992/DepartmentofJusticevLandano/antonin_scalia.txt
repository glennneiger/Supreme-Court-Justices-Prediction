justice
antonin
scalia
well,
on
that
point--
--it
could
have
said
that
so
easily
and
so
explicitly.
congress
had
the
opportunity
to
say,
"all
investigatory
records
of
law
enforcement
agencies.
"
it
didn't.
it
would
be
so
easy
to
say
that,
and
you
say
that
by
simply
saying,
"all
investigatory
records
of
law
enforcement
agencies
provided
by
confidential
sources.
"
you're
saying
essentially,
"provided
by
confidential
sources"
means
nothing...
virtually
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
do
not
treat
them
as
privileged.
justice
antonin
scalia
wiretaps...
wiretaps
is
not
provided
in
confidence,
so
if
you
wiretap
me
that
becomes
public--
justice
antonin
scalia
--above
board
and
ask
me
a
question,
that
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
--communicating.
how
could
i
possibly
have
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
you
generally
give
out,
outside
of
newspaper
clippings?
what
vast
amount
of
information
would
be
saved
by
this
carefully
crafted
exemption.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
kind,
newspaper
clippings
and
things
obtained
from--
justice
antonin
scalia
--magazine
clippings.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
about
my--
--you
said
congress
said
that.
where
did
congress
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
specifically
who
said
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
people
are
on
that
committee,
do
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
even
if
there
were...
even
if
you
required
an
assurance
of
confidentiality,
an
explicit
assurance,
you
couldn't
give
an
assurance
of
confidentiality
that
would
tell
the
person
he
wouldn't
have
to
testify.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
would
make
the
provision
a
dead
letter.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
daly,
you
say
as
a
first
step
at
least
they
should...
what's
the
second
step?
what
does
the
person
who
wants
information,
what
does
he
do
when
the
fbi
says
well,
presumptively
in
the
absence
of
other
indication,
as
you
put
it,
this
is
confidential?
what
do
i
then
do
as
the
requester?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then
don't
describe
it
as
a
first
step.
i
mean,
you're
really
just
closing
the
door,
as
a
practical
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
mind
if
the
result
is
rare.
i...
it
strikes
me
as
rare
that
the
requester
even
has
the
tools
to
challenge.
how
do
i
know
what
the
circumstances
are?
i
just
have
to
trust
you
to
say
that
the
circumstances
are
such
that
it
was
provided
under
an
assurance
of
confidentiality,
don't
i?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
point
is
that
that
shows
that
there
was
no
assurance
of...
but
they
couldn't
give
an
assurance
of
confidentiality
that
they
wouldn't
be
compelled
to
disclose
some
matters
in
the
course
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well
then,
there's
no
such
thing
as
an
assurance
of
confidentiality
if
you
insist
that
it
be
absolute.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
in
the
course
of
litigation
that
they
turned
it
over.
they
just
didn't
say,
hey,
you
want
these
names...
here.
it
was
in
the
course
of
a
discovery
request
filed
with
them,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
people
tell
me
things
sometimes,
and
say
keep
it
confidential,
and
i
often
tell
my
wife.
i
don't
feel
i'm
breaking
a...
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
know,
but
i
don't
blab
it
around.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
take
it
that...
there
are
two
parts
to
the
exemption.
the
first
part
is
you
can
keep
out
information
that
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
disclose
the
identity
of
a
confidential
source.
the
second
part
is,
in
the
case
of
information
compiled
by
a
criminal
law
enforcement
agency
you
can
keep
out
not
only
the
information
that
will
disclose
the
identity,
but
all
of
the
information.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
it's
pretty
clear
what
the
reason--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
that,
isn't
it?
we
don't
want
to
take
a
chance--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
any
snippet
of
information
you
might
provide
might
enable
the
requester
who,
in
some
cases
is
a
very
dangerous
person--
justice
antonin
scalia
--behind
bars
in
prison
who
files
a
foia
request.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
want
to
take
the
chance--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
some
piece
of
information
that
means
nothing
to
us
meaning
a
lot
to
him
and
enabling
him
to
identify
a
victim.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
is
it
in
accord
with
that
prophylactic
approach
to
this
statute
to
handle
it
the
way
that
you're
suggesting,
to
require
the
fbi
in
each
case...
and
in
some
case
they
can't
come
up
with
the
necessary...
well,
we
made
a
mistake,
somebody
dies.
too
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
make
them
prove
that
just
the
way
you're
making
them
prove
this.
i
mean,
can
they
adopt
a
categorical
rule
in
the
case
of
any
request
from
violent
people
in
prison?
we're
going
to
assume
that
any
names
we
give
them,
or
any
information
we
give
them
might
help
them
to
get
somebody.
you
wouldn't
let
them
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
they
thought
it
meant...
maybe
it's
because
they
thought
it
meant
what
they
now
say
it
means.
they
thought
it
enabled
them
to
say
categorically
of
course
this
information
was
proven.
isn't
that
a
possible
explanation
of
why
they
said
nothing?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
fair
to
conclude
from
that
that
senator
leahy
agreed
with
the
congressional
research
service,
don't
you
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
probably
not
much
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
have
in
fact
said
that,
mr.
mullin.
we
haven't
always
behaved
that
way,
though,
you
must
admit
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
our
cases--
justice
antonin
scalia
--don't
always
square
with
that
noble
sentiment
that
we've
expressed.
