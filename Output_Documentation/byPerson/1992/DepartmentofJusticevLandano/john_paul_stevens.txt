mr.
daly,
you
gave
some
examples
earlier
of,
say,
an
undercover
agent
talking
to
people,
and
there
you
would
agree
that
there's
no
presumption
of
confidentiality.
can
we
tell
from
the
materials
you
filed
in
this
case
that
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case,
that
some
of
these
people
whose
interviews
are
not
being
disclosed
were
simply
undercover
agents
talking
to
people
who
had
no
idea
they
were
even
fbi
agents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
to
look
at
the
documents
to
tell
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
how
would
the
requester
know
whether
it
was
an
undercover
agent
or
just
a
regular
interview?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
identify
those
cases
in
which
it
is
a
regular
interview
as
opposed
to
an
undercover
agent?
i
couldn't
find
it
right
here,
but
i
remember
when
i
read
the
briefs
i
had
the
impression
that
i
couldn't
tell
whether
this
might
have
been
somebody
who
just
was...
had
a
discussion
with
an
fbi
agent
who
was
not
even
known
to
be
an
fbi
agent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
the
theory
wouldn't
apply,
but
the
documents
that
you
file
in
the
district
court
supporting
your
refusal
to
produce
don't
tell
the
judge
whether
he
might
not
have
been
an
undercover
agent,
as
i
read
them.
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think
you
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
it
seems
to
me--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
papers
that
you
are
arguing
are
sufficient
would
prevent
disclosure
of
the
cases
which
you
say...
in
cases
where
you
say
there
should
be
disclosure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
you're
not
misrepresenting,
you
just
file
something
to
say
you
should
presume
everybody's...
basically,
you've
said
everybody
we
talk
to
should
be
presumed
to
be
a
confidential
informant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
didn't
say
that
as
to
the
particular,
you
said
that's
our
general
practice.
as
i
understood
the
paper,
you
were
basically
describing
a
general
practice
which
would
generally
support...
when
the
practice
applies,
would
generally
support
confidentiality,
but
under
that
umbrella
it
seems
to
me
you're
going
to
pick
up
all
these
cases
in
which
you
think
there
should
be
disclosure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
my
problem
is...
i'm
not
questioning
your
good
faith,
of
course,
but
my
problem
is,
how...
i
can't
tell
whether
a
requester
could
tell
whether
you'd
done
that
or
not,
and
requesters
tend
to
be
suspicious,
of
course.
maybe
i'm
not
making
my
point
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
your
theory
in
this
court
wouldn't,
and
so
forth,
but
i'm
concerned
about
the
particular
case
where
you
file
this
boilerplate
affidavit
which
seems
to
me
is
so
broad
that
it
would
cover
every
interview.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
my
problem
is,
i
don't
know
how
the
district
judge
or
the
requester
could
tell
by
reading
the
affidavit
that
maybe
some
zealous
fbi
agent
had
used
it
inappropriately--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--without
saying
anything
false,
because
there's
no
false
representation
in
it.
