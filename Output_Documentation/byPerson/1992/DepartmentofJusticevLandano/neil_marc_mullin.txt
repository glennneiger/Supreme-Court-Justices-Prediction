mr.
neil
marc
mullin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fbi
offers
essentially
three
arguments
in
support
of
its
nearly
irrebuttable
presumption.
one
is
its
claim
that
as
a
factual
matter
the
fbi's
presumption
mirrors
the
relationship
between
itself
as
an
agency
and
its
sources.
that
is,
what
my
adversary
just
said
holds.
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
investigation,
sources
expect
confidentiality,
typically,
and
typically
the
fbi
assures
it.
i
call
that
the
setting
argument.
the
second
argument
is
a
pragmatic
argument.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
the
setting.
that
is,
in
the
setting
of
a
criminal
investigation,
confidentiality
is
inherent.
the
second
argument
is
that...
is
what
i'm
calling
a
pragmatic
argument,
which
is
that
the
fbi...
that
if
the
presumption
that
the
fbi
seeks
here
today
is
not
granted
there
will
be
some
sort
of
administrative
or
adjudicative
havoc,
that
the
fbi
is
not
prepared
to
come
forward
with
case-specific
proofs
in
the
event
this
court
affirms
the
third
circuit,
that
the
fbi
doesn't
maintain
records
of
confidentiality.
even
though
confidentiality
is
so
important,
the
fbi
tells
us,
they
maintain
no
records,
so
that
an
agent
in
1952
doesn't
know
whether
in
1946
a
source
was
assured
confidentiality...
no
records.
third
is
a
textual
claim
that
the
1986
amendments
and
their
history
provide
a
statutory
basis
for
the
presumption.
this
argument
is
somewhat
of
a
moving
target.
in
their
reply
brief
the
fbi
seems
to
shift
from
the
affirmative
posture
of
its
main
brief
that
the
1986
language
provides
a
textual
basis
for
its
presumption
to
a
claim...
a
more
cautious
claim
that
foia
simply
doesn't
preclude
a
presumption.
the
fbi's
claim
that
in
the
setting
of
a
criminal
investigation
virtually
all
witnesses
typically
require
confidentiality
doesn't
ring
true
in
the
context,
for
example,
of
this
case.
before
the
criminal
trial
of
the
matter
underlying
this
case,
numerous
fbi
investigative
reports
prepared
by
the
fbi
were
turned
over
to
my
client.
i
was
not
the
trial
lawyer.
in
those
discovery
documents,
the
names
of
41
law
enforcement
personnel
were
revealed,
31
witnesses
were
revealed
by
name,
and
16
of
them
by
address.
the
fact
that
some
of
these
witnesses
testified
at
trial
appears
in
press
clippings
in
the
disclosures
that
the
fbi
made
to
me.
indeed,
the
hudson
county
prosecutor's
office
that
worked--
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
--exactly.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
no,
i
don't
insist
that
it
be
absolute,
your
honor.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
i
think...
yes,
that's
right.
well,
if
confidentially
means
even
people
who
get
up
in
front
of
public...
in
front
of
trials,
in
front
of
juries,
in
front
of
cameras
and
newspapers,
then
i'm
wrong
and
the
fbi's
right.
that's
what
confidentiality
means.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
exactly.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
and
if
i...
your
honor,
and
if
i'm
a
source,
and
i
tell
the
fbi
to
maintain
confidentiality,
what
i
mean
is,
you
can
tell
law
enforcement
people
as
needed,
but
please,
don't
tell
the
people
over
there
that
want
to
kill
me
or
harass
me.
i
want
anonymity.
in
the
case
of
an
entity,
your
honor,
which
is
also
covered
by
7(d),
it
may
not
mean
anonymity,
it
may
mean,
i
need
secrecy.
sure,
everybody
knows
that
the
new
york
police
department
is
a
source
of
the
fbi,
but
don't
reveal
my
operational
secrets.
and
in
the
parlance
of
the
congressional
discussion
of
7(d)
and
7
broadly,
in
that
parlance,
in
that
usage,
it
became
clear
that
what
congress
was
talking
about
was
anonymity,
confidentiality
in
the
sense
i'm
talking
about.
director
webster,
director
casey
appeared
there...
they
were
worried
about
people
who
feared
that
detriment
would
come
to
them.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
they
used
the
word,
"confidential"
in
order
to
broaden
the
category
from
"informer",
which
was
in
the
original
draft.
they
used
the
word
"confidential"
to
show
they
weren't
just
considering
paid
informants
or
cloak-and-dagger
informants
in
the
traditional
sense,
so
they
chose
the
word,
"confidential".
would
that
they
had
used
a
phrase
such
as
they
used
in
the
debate
interchangeably
with
confidential
source.
you
know,
would
that
they
had
used
the
phrase,
anonymous
or
some
element
of
secret,
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
i
agree
to
you
there
is
some
element
of
ambiguity
in
the
phrase,
"confidential
source",
that
requires
us
to
look
at
the
congressional
debate,
just
as
this
court
in
abramsom
looked
at
the
usage
of
the
word,
"record"
in
the
congressional
discussion
in
order
to
determine
its
meaning.
in
the
real
world,
as
in
this
case...
this
case
involved
a
police
killing,
and
what
i'm
telling
the
court
is
people
came
forward
freely,
openly,
wanting
to
help.
those
that
didn't
want
to
get
involved,
to
use
an
expression,
didn't
get
involved.
they
didn't
give
statements
at
all.
but
those
that
chose
to
get
involved
in
this
very
serious
crime
as
witnesses
came
forward,
provided
their
names
and
addresses,
testified
at
trial...
in
the
real
world
there
is
no
invariable
setting.
this
is
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make.
while
sources
will
require
anonymity
or
degree
of
secrecy
of
information,
the
average
witness
to
some
discrete
aspect
of
a
crime,
having
made
the
difficult
threshold
decision
to
get
involved,
does
not
thereafter
typically
require
some
sweeping
confidentiality.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
well,
there's
great
difficulty
in
evaluating,
because
the
fbi
has
not
provided
this
court,
or
congress
for
that
matter,
with
a
record.
the
fbi
hasn't
told
us
what
percentage
of
sources
want
confidentiality
in
the
narrow
sense,
what
percentage
of
sources
need
some
kind
of
anonymity,
which
entities
require
some
level
of
secrecy.
mr.
daly
stands
up
and
tells...
in
response
to,
i
believe
it
was
justice
o'connor's
question,
no,
we
keep
no
records
of
confidentiality,
we
make
no
notation.
that's
not
in
the
record.
that's
not
here,
and
it's
not
in
the
congressional
record,
because
congress
was
not
grappling
with
the
problem
mr.
daly
brings
to
this
court
in
1981,
'82,
'83,
'84.
congress
was
not
confronted
by
a
law
enforcement
community
that
said,
gee,
it's
going
to
be
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
prove
a
source
confidential.
in
all
those
pages
of
congressional
record,
the
fbi
has
not
cited
to
this
court
one
phrase
suggesting
that
problem
was
what
congress
was
grappling
with
when
it
drafted
exemption,
redrafted
it
in
1986.
no,
your
honor,
there
is
no
evidentiary
basis,
and
no
basis
in
the
congressional
record,
for
justifying,
supporting
this
sweeping
presumption.
there
is
no
basis
for
this
court
to
conclude
that
that
presumption
nears
reality.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
sure.
if
a
witness--
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
--i
am
burdened
by
the
formulation
used
by
the
third
circuit.
it's
a
difficult
burden
to
defend
it
in
that
precise
formulation,
but--
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
--i
think
what's
happened
here,
your
honor,
is
that
because
this
presumption
took
hold
throughout
the
circuits
actually
much
later
than
might
have
been
suggested
in
the
brief
of
the
fbi,
the
development
of
the
common
law,
if
you
will,
of
exemption
7,
has
been
truncated.
the
courts
have
not
been
struggling
with
the
issue
you
speak
of
and
trying
to
devise
methods
of
proof.
i
think
that
if
this
court
will
condemn,
disapprove
this
sweeping
presumption,
it
will
necessarily
open
up
a
practical
process
of
developing
workable
rules.
your
honor
suggested
what
might
be
a
factually
based
or
grounded
presumption.
suppose
someone
knowingly
gives
inculpatory
information
about
a
known
organized
crime
figure?
certainly
in
those
circumstances,
where
there
is
a
known,
substantial
threat
of
detriment,
there
should
be
a
presumption
of
confidentiality,
arguably.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
well,
i
think
the
fbi
should
tell
us,
or
tell
congress
what
is
in
its
records.
i
suspect
the
fbi
takes
detailed
notes,
your
honor--
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
--your
honor,
i
hope
it
doesn't
come
to
that.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
the
fbi
probably
has
a
higher
level
of
detail
in
its
files
than
it
suggests
here.
why?
when
director
webster
testified
before
congress,
he
provided
hundreds
of
detailed
examples
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
interviews
with
sources
where
in
they
requested
anonymity
or
secrecy,
or
expressed
those
fears.
where
did
the
director
get
those
literally
hundreds
of
detailed
examples,
if
not
from
the
fbi's
records?
i
suggest
that
it
is
not
worthy
of
credence
when
the
fbi
tells
us
here
that
they
don't
have
records
that
can
satisfy
a
more...
a
higher
level
of
specificity.
the
law
has
been
unsettled
in
this
area.
certainly
one
reading
vaughn
v.
rosen
in
1974
would
not
predict
the
dow
case
some
years
later.
vaughn
seemed
to
suggest
that
the
agencies
would
be
required
to
submit
a
high
level
of
specification
in
defending
exemptions.
and
then
there
was
lame
in
1981,
and
there
was
keeney
in
1980,
a
second
circuit
case
that
seemed
to
echo
the
third
circuit's
rule,
and
there
was
the
dearing
milliken
case
in
1977
that
said,
whether
or
not
a
source
is
confidential
is
a
question
of
fact.
is
it
possible
that
the
fbi,
in
the
face
of
an
unsettled
body
of
law,
took
the
most
aggressive
approach
and
said
we'll
follow
the
majority
rule
even
before
it
was
a
majority
rule
and
didn't
keep
records
in
the
event
this
court
should
some
day
resolve
this
unsettled
body
of
law
by
saying
no,
this
presumption
has
no
basis
in
this
statute,
this
presumption
has
no
factual
basis?
that
proposition
is
not
worthy
of
credence.
i
submit
that
the
fbi
obeyed
the
law
in
the
third
circuit,
as
they
had
to,
and
that
the
fbi
made
case-specific
determinations,
at
least
within
that
circuit
and
that,
given
the
unsettled
nature
of
the
law,
the
fbi
kept
accurate
records
such
as
the
director
relied
on,
such
as
the
dea
relied
on
when
it
submitted
numerous
detailed
examples
of
circumstances
surrounding
interviews.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
yes.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
that's
right.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
yes,
sir.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
that's
right.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
that's
right.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
that's
right.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
that's
correct.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
that's
correct.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
your
honor,
a
number
of
answers.
i
think
that's
a
very,
very
weighty
question,
and
when
i
make
the
argument
here
i'm
not
unaware
of
the
dangers
that
exist
for
informants.
fortunately,
7(d)
is
not
the
only
way
congress
dealt
with
that
problem.
7(f),
as
you
know,
was
expanded.
if
an
informant's,
or
confidential
source's,
or
anybody's
life
or
safety
is
threatened
in
any
way,
it
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
be
threatened,
all
the
fbi
has
to
do
is
check
off
7(f)
and
there's
no
danger
to
life
or
safety.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
no.
i
think
you're
raising
a
weakness
in
the
text
of
this
statute.
i
think
it's
important
that
courts
remain
very
sensitive
to
the
dangers
here.
whatever
this
court
rules,
it
must
remind
them
of
the
dangers
here.
workable
rules
that
are
based
in
fact
have
to
be
developed
so
that
groups
of
witnesses,
groups
of
sources
can
be
analyzed,
so
that
presumptions
that
are
factually
based
can
be
utilized.
well,
that's
exactly
right.
the
fbi
didn't
present
this
problem
to
the
legislature.
they
presented
the
mosaic
problem
but
not
this
problem,
and
now
they
are
presenting
a
problem
they
sat
silently
about.
in
1981,
'83,
'84,
they
didn't
mention
this
problem
to
congress,
not
once,
even
though
they
brought
the
lame
decision
to
the
attention
of
congress.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
respectfully
no,
your
honor,
because
the
fbi
premises
its
categorical
argument
on
case
law
that
arose
after
lame,
especially
reporters
committee,
the
'86
case,
so
i
don't
think
that
the
categorical
approach
to
the...
i
don't
think
the
exemptions
that
were
in
jurisprudence
had
developed
to
a
point
in
1981
when
lame
came
down
to
where
the
fbi
would
have
anticipated
a
categorical--
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
--miller
v.
bell.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
that
was
1981,
i
believe.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
that's
correct.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
well,
i
should
think
they'd
have
a
very
great
problem,
your
honor,
with
such
a
deep
split
in
the
circuits.
the
seventh
circuit
adopted
the
approach
they
urge
here
in
'81,
and
in
'81
the
third
circuit
explicitly
adopted
the
approach
it
took
in
my
case,
the
landano
case.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
those
circumstances
if
the
fbi
really
thought
this
was
a
problem
they
would
have
brought
that
split
in
the
circuits
to
the
attention
of
congress.
in
a
congressional
research
report
that
was
put
into
the
record
by
the
sponsors
of
the
1986
amendments,
which
i've
cited
in
my
brief,
the
research
group
says
that
"this
amendment
to
exemption
7
is
not
intended
to
overrule
any
specific
case,
or
any
specific
line
of
authority.
"
and
i've
quoted
that
in
my
brief.
that
means
lame,
according
to
that--
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
--that
was
the
crs,
your
honor,
the
congressional
research
service.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
no,
but
it
was
put
into
the
record
by
one
of
the
sponsors,
your
honor.
excuse
me.
on
page
38
in
my
brief,
senator
leahy,
a
codrafter
and
co-sponsor
of
the
'86
amendments
to
exemption
7,
referring
to
the
proposed
substitution
of
"could
reasonably
be
expected"
for
the
language
"would",
put
into
the
record
the
congressional
research
analysis
which
said,
"the
proposed
amendment
does
not
appear
to
be
prompted
by
any
particular
case
or
line
of
cases
that
have
enunciated
a
contrary
standard
of
the
degree
of
risk
of
harm
that
must
be
shown
to
justify
assertion
of
exemption
7(a)(d)
or
(f).
"
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
that's
often
the
case--
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
--well,
one
thing
we
can
say,
that
not
once
did
congress
consider
this
problem,
and
i'm
talking
about
all
the
senators
and
all
the
congressmen.
they
didn't
hear
about
this
proof
problem
or
this
administrative
problem,
and
because
they
didn't
hear
about
it,
they
didn't
address
it.
the
language
in
exemption
7
that
was
as
modified
in
1986
was
not
directed
at
this
problem.
the
fbi
therefore
has
a
very
difficult
textual
problem.
even
when
this
court
adopted
a
categorical
approach
to
exemption
7(c),
still
it
sought
a
textual
basis
in
the
"could
reasonably
be
expected"
language,
as
it
did
in
grolier,
as
it
did
in
robbins.
this
court
has
always
sought
a
textual
basis.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
of
course.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
i'm
suggesting
that
the
government
must
show
this
court
a
textual
basis
in
foia
as
amended
in
'86.
why?
because
this
court
has
held
that
unless
exemptions
are
clearly
delineated
in
the
statute,
then
they
will
not
be
honored.
can
anyone...
i'm
sure
the
fbi
would
not
contend
before
you
today
that...
would
not
deny
that
their
presumption
expands
the
exemption
7(d),
gives
it
a
much
broader
impact,
but
this
court
has
said
that
if
an
exemption
is
not
clearly
delineated,
it
doesn't
exist,
and
this
court
has
said--
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
--the
exemption
should
be
narrowly
construed.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
yes.
i
feel
a
little
bit
like
the
guy
who
said
the
emperor
has
no
clothes
on.
i'm
saying
it.
the
emperor
has
no
clothes
on.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
all
these
circuits
are
wrong.
[laughter]
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
yes,
i
do.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
yes,
i
do.
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
well,
i
think
i've
covered
most
everything.
i
suppose
i
should
close
on--
mr.
neil
marc
mullin
--i
know
it
wouldn't,
and
my
inclination
is
to
stop
while
i
have
the
illusion
that
i'm
ahead.
[laughter]
thank
you
very
much
for
your
time.
