we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
91-2054,
the
united
states
department
of
justice
v.
vincent
james
landano.
mr.
daly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
types
of
sources
are
you
referring
to
again,
mr.
daly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
contention
is
that
it
should
be
enough
to
invoke
exemption
7
if
the
fbi
shows
that
the
statement
made
by
a
particular
individual
was
made
to
an
fbi
agent
investigating
a
crime.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
daly.
mr.
mullin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
call
it
the
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
couldn't
they
use
the
word,
anonymous,
then,
rather
than
confidential?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we're
talking,
i
guess,
about
two
different
suppositions.
one
is
the
supposition
that
you
advanced
to
us
just
now
based
on
your
own
experience.
the
fbi
says
something
different.
how
do
we
evaluate
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
would
one
know
all
that
just
from
a
record
of
the
interview?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
tell
congress.
now
you're
talking
about,
what,
amending
the
statute
again?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
it
speak
as
to
the
intent
of
congress?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
seventh
circuit
in
miller
presumably
ruled
for
the
fbi
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
as
it
existed
before
1986.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
i
mean,
are
you
suggesting
that
unless
the
government
can
make
its
case
through
the
1986
amendments,
it
must
fail
completely?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
courts
of
appeals
such
as
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
ones
that
followed
were
simply
wrong,
then,
in
your
view.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mullin.
mr.
daly,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
daly.
the
case
is
submitted.
