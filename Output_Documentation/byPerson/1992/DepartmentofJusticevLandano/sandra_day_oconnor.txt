and
that
would
be
true
even,
for
example,
if
the
fbi
were
contacting
some
state
authority
in
another
state
to
determine
somebody's
whereabouts,
or
their
criminal
record,
or
anything
of
that
kind.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
you
wouldn't
normally
think
that
would
be
considered
confidential.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
as
to
routine
information
that's
a
matter
of
public
record
in
that
state.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
strikes
me
that
there
could
well
be
people
who
talk
to
the
fbi
who
don't
have
that
expectation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
perhaps
the
circumstances
of
a
particular
investigation
would
certainly
justify
the
assumption
in
some
cases.
for
instance,
a
witness
of
a
gang-related
killing
or
something,
i
think
most
people
would
think
those
circumstances
would
give
rise
to
a
presumption
of
constitutionality,
but
i'm
not
sure
it
applies
across
the
board.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
mean
if
you
can
determine
from
the
particular
circumstances
that
there
is
a
likelihood
of
the
presumption
of
confidentiality,
that's
one
thing,
but
i
wonder
if
it
should
be
applied
across
the
board?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the...
is
it
a
practice
at
the
fbi
for
any
kind
of
notation
to
be
put
in
the
file
in
connection
with
each
witness
interview
as
to
whether
it's
confidential
or
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
whether
there's
been
any
assurance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
guess
you
could
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
having
to
show
just
the
general
circumstances
surrounding
the
situation?
that's--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
how
about
the
nature
of
the
crime--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
witness'
relation
to
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
mullin,
it
seems
to
me
the
third
circuit
went
pretty
far
in
requiring
case-specific
proof
here,
and
i'm
just
wondering
if
a
considerably
lesser
evidentiary
showing
wouldn't
suffice.
for
instance,
what's
investigated
here
is
a
gang
crime,
and
it's
logical
that
witnesses
are
going
to
be
nervous
about
exposing
their
identity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
defend
the
precise
holding
of
the
third
circuit
here
on
its
requirements?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
i
just
wonder
if
they
haven't
gone
too
far,
and
whether
some
much
lesser
showing
might
not
suffice
and
still
be
case-by-case.
