mr.
john
f.
daly
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
exemption
7(d)
of
the
freedom
of
information
act,
which
permits
the
fbi
and
other
federal
law
enforcement
agencies
to
protect
the
identities
of
confidential
sources
and
also,
in
the
case
of
criminal
law
investigations,
the
information
provided
by
those
sources.
the
specific
question
presented
here
is
what
exactly
the
fbi
must
do
in
district
court
to
establish
that
a
particular
source
may
be
treated
as
a
confidential
one.
seven
of
the
u.s.
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
adopted
the
approach
that
we
urge
on
the
court
today.
that
is,
to
allow
the
fbi
to
carry
its
burden
by
means
of
a
categorical
showing
in
which
the
fbi
shows
that
each
of
the
documents
at
issue
falls
within
a
category
of
sources...
for
example,
state
and
local
law
enforcement
agencies,
for
which
an
assurance
of
confidentiality
is
inherently
implicit
in
the
normal
course
of
events.
on
the
other
hand,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
present
case
has
set
down
a
rigid
rule
that
the
fbi
cannot
invoke
exemption
7(d)
unless
it
can
provide
"detailed
explanations
relating
to
each
alleged
confidential
source.
"
we
submit
that
the
fbi
should
indeed
be
able
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
a
categorical
showing
presuming
confidentiality
for
these
types
of
sources
in
the
absence
of
an
indication
otherwise.
there
are
two
essential
reasons--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--the
categories
are
indeed
broad,
your
honor.
for
example,
in
this
case
the
fbi
has
contended
that
the
individuals
who
provide
information
to
the
fbi
in
the
course
of
a
criminal
investigation
normally
do
so
with
an
inherent
understanding,
an
implied
understanding
of
confidentiality.
mr.
john
f.
daly
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
f.
daly
very
much
so,
justice
o'connor,
because
as
the--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--i
would
beg
to
disagree,
justice
o'connor,
because
as
the
declaration
in
the
present
case
indicates,
there
is
a
particular
tradition
of
confidentiality
in
the
sort
of
information
exchanged
between
law
enforcement
agencies.
when
the
law
enforcement
agencies
and
the
fbi
exchange
information,
there
is
a
tacit
understanding,
which
i
believe
the
declaration
in
the
present
case
said,
for
example,
is
reinforced
in
the
daily
contacts
that
fbi
special
agents
have
with
local
law
enforcement
agencies.
mr.
john
f.
daly
well,
something
like
arrest
records--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--well,
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
what's
important
is
not
necessarily
the
subjective
expectation
of
each
individual,
and
the
problem,
as
we've
pointed
out,
is
that
to
base
the
rule
on
the
content
of
the
information
raises
very
problematic
issues,
because
certainly
when
people
are
contacted,
they...
what
they
know
for
sure
is
they're
talking
to
an
fbi
agent
about
a
matter
of
criminal
law.
that's
the
entire
premise
for
our
presentation.
an
individual,
or
even
a
local
police
department,
may
not
necessarily
know
what
information
will
be
particularly
salient,
and
certainly
in
many
investigations...
after
all,
the
present
one
involves
the
murder
of
a
police
officer.
even
the...
what
may
seem
on
the
surface
to
be
routine--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--well,
i
think
the
important
point,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
we
need
a
starting
point
for
this
analysis.
the
problem,
as
we
point
out,
both
in
terms
of
the
statutory
language
and
the
underlying
policies
of
exemption
7(d)
is
that
you
need
a
realistic
starting
point
because,
if
one
has
to
rely
on
the
content
of
the
information,
of
the
particular
crime
that's
at
stake,
the
protection
that's
going
to
be
provided
is
going
to
be
very
unreliable,
and
that's
one
of
the
keys
to
this
case,
i
think.
mr.
john
f.
daly
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
main
circumstance
that
we
do
know
is
that
we
know
that
someone...
say,
an
individual...
has
provided
information
to
the
fbi
in
the
course
of
a
criminal
investigation.
that
very
fact
is
very
important,
because
the
fbi
has
a
decades-long
tradition
of
maintaining
the
confidentiality
of
its
records.
mr.
john
f.
daly
no,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
john
f.
daly
no,
justice
o'connor,
and
that
is
one
of
the
key
problems
here.
mr.
john
f.
daly
it
potentially
could
be
done
prospectively.
we
would
submit
that
congress
hasn't
imposed
such
a
requirement
on
the
fbi,
and
that
in
itself
would
be
a
very
dramatic
departure
from
the
way
the
fbi
is
doing
business
now,
and
on
a
practical
level
as
well,
this...
the
respondent
has
tried
to
characterize
our
position
as
something
new,
some
change.
in
fact,
this
is
the
way
the
fbi
has
been
proceeding
throughout
the
history
of
exemption
7(d)
since
it
was
enacted
in
1974.
even
if
one
were
to
say
that
oh,
the
fbi
could
change
the
way
it
does
business
in
the
future,
(a)
that
in
itself
would
be
a
change
that
should
come
from
congress
and
not
the
courts,
and
(b)
that
would
do
nothing
for
the
enormous
storehouse
of
information
which
exists
right
now.
i
mean,
if
the
court
were
to
say,
well,
it's
all
well
and
good,
but
the
fbi
has
to
show
us
specific
circumstances,
for
most
of
what's
there
it
simply
doesn't
exist.
mr.
john
f.
daly
i
think
part
of
the
problem
that
we
have
with
the
respondent's
view
and
with
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
they've
never
told
us
exactly
what
circumstances
they
want
to
hear,
and
frankly
we
have
to
question
how
useful
the
information
would
be,
if
one
is
talking
about
the
physical
circumstances...
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room.
the
door
was
closed.
mr.
john
f.
daly
the
nature--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--that
is
something
that
we
will
sometimes
be
able
to
tell
from
the
face
of
the
documents,
but
there
again,
i
think
one
of
the
keys
which
we
discuss
in
our
brief
is
the
fact
that
congress
was
aware
that...
what
needs
reliable
protection
for
sources,
and
in
our
view
the
language
of
the
statute
gives
great
flexibility
in
this
regard.
after
all--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--no,
not
really,
justice
scalia.
you
must
recall
that
there
are
a
number
of
sources
that
the
fbi
deals
with
that
wouldn't
qualify
as
confidential
at
all.
there
are
many
published
sources...
for
example,
books
and
magazines.
wiretaps
can
be
very
important
source
of
law
information;
also,
unwitting
witnesses
who
provide
information
to,
for
example,
an
fbi
agent
operating
under
cover.
now,
those
are
all
sources,
in
the
normal
sense
of
that
term,
and--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--no,
we
do
not,
because
the
rationale
that
we're
talking
about
here
just
doesn't
apply
to
those
kinds
of
sources.
the...
in...
this
court,
in
cia
v.
sims--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--it
wouldn't
nec--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--there
may
be
other
exemptions.
mr.
john
f.
daly
there--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia,
because
when
you
think...
if
we
wiretap
you,
obviously
without
your
knowledge,
there
is
nothing
in
those
circumstances
from
which
a
reasonable
person
could
assume
that
there
was
an
assurance
of
confidentiality.
when...
in
1974,
when
congress
enacted
exemption
7(d),
the
language
that
congress
used
in
the
background
was
to
say
that
a
confidential
source
is
one
who
provides
information
under
an
express
assurance
of
confidentiality,
or
in
circumstances
from
which
such
an
assurance
could
reasonably
be
inferred.
you
certainly
can
make
no
reasonable
inference
about
confidentiality
when
you're
just
talking
on
your
phone.
mr.
john
f.
daly
of
course.
mr.
john
f.
daly
but
that's
key,
and
that's
a
key
limitation.
mr.
john
f.
daly
it
certainly
might,
justice
white,
and
i
certainly
wouldn't
want
to
say
that
wiretaps
are
something
which
we
generally
would
give
out,
but
the
rationale
that
we're
talking
about
today
would
not
apply
to
that
at
all.
mr.
john
f.
daly
well,
the
kinds
of
information
i've
just
talked
about,
and
also
anything--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--things
that
came--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--if
it
weren't
subject
to
some
other
exemption,
something
such
as
information
provided
by
unwitting
sources
who
talked
to
an
undercover
agent.
also,
anything
that
the
fbi
agents
themselves
do.
if
they're...
there
are
plenty
of
documents
that
were
given
out
in
this
case
that
refer
to
what
the
agents
themselves
were
doing.
as
long
as
that
is
the
subject
of
the
document
and
it
doesn't
relay
information
that
was
given
to
the
fbi
by
a
source,
then
certainly
that
could
go
out.
mr.
john
f.
daly
i
don't--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--i
don't
think
we
ignore
it,
justice
souter.
even
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
present
case
recognized
that
there
were
degrees
of
confidentiality.
there's
also
a
very
good
discussion
of
that
point
by
judge
silbeiman
in
the
mary
jones
case.
mr.
john
f.
daly
well,
i
think
we
have
two
answers
there,
justice
souter,
and
first
of
all
i
would
have
to
take
issue
with
the
notion
that
a
person
who
thought
that
he
might
have
to
testify,
or
even
that
he
would
probably
have
to
testify,
such
a
person
could
still
have
an
implied
assurance
of
confidentiality
to
an
important
degree.
this
case
doesn't
expressly
pose
the
issue
of
waiver,
but
several
of
the
lower
courts--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--i
don't
think
that's
so
at
all,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
when
congress
was
enacting
7(d)
it
specifically
stated
that
confidentiality
was
not
to
be
limited
to
express
confidentiality,
and
that,
i
think,
is
one
of
the
key
problems
with
respondent's
view.
essentially,
what
they're
asking
for
is
that
if
you...
if
the
fbi
is
required
to
make
this
fact-specific
showing,
and
not
even
knowing
what
circumstances
are
going
to
satisfy
most
district
courts,
what
we're
probably
going
to
be
left
with
as
the
only
way
that
we
can
reliably
protect
confidentiality
is
expressed
confidentiality,
but
congress
didn't
say
that.
congress
said
that
they
wanted
to
protect
sources
who
receive
express
assurances
of
confidentiality,
or
who
provided
information
under
circumstances
in
which
an
implication
of
confidentiality
would
naturally
follow.
mr.
john
f.
daly
that's
in
the
legislative
history,
judge...
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
f.
daly
that
was
in
the
conference
committee
report--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--i
can't
give
you
the
exact
number.
as
we've
pointed
out,
that
conference
committee
report
was
a
fairly
key
juncture
of
the
legislation
because
there
were
changes
made
in
the
conference
committee
before
it
was
finally
enacted
by
congress,
but
to
return--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--we
acknowledge,
justice
souter,
that
it's
going
to
be
very
difficult
for
them
to
make
such
a
showing.
i'd
like
to
get
to
that.
i
want
to
answer,
actually,
the
other
part
of
your
question
that
i
don't
think
i
got
to
yet,
which
is
the
notion
that
a
person
who
thinks
that
he
might
be
called
upon
the
testify
later
would
necessarily
not
have
an
implication
of
confidentiality,
and
we
would
take
strong
issue
with
that.
this
case
doesn't
expressly
involve
the
issue
of
waiver,
but
that's
another
issue
that
the
courts
have
dealt
with
extensively.
one
of
the
leading
cases
is
the
en
banc
decision
of
the
first
circuit
in
the
irons
case.
in
that
case,
that
court
recognized
that
there
are
degrees
of
confidentiality,
and
merely
because
someone
is
called
upon
the
testify,
there
may
be
much
about
that
person's
involvement
with
the
fbi
that
remains
confidential.
we
don't
always
know,
even
after
a
person
testifies,
everything
about
what
he
told
the
fbi.
there
may
be
important
things
left.
as
judge
bryer
concluded
for
the
court
there,
that
residuum
of
confidentiality
is
itself
extremely
important,
and
so
therefore
i'd
say
to
you
first
of
all
that
a
person
who
talks
to
the
fbi
merely
knowing
that
he
might
eventually
be
called
upon
to
testify
could
indeed
still
have
a
very
strong
implied
assurance
of
confidentiality
because
his
normal
expectation,
and
the
normal
expectations
i
think
of
all
citizens
based
on
the
fbi's
long
practice
of
maintaining
its
record
so
carefully
and
so
confidentially,
is
that
that
information
is
not
going
to
be
made
generally
available
to
the
public,
as
it
is
under
foia.
no.
instead,
the
fbi's
going
to
treat
the
information
with
care,
use
it
for
certain
purposes,
it
may
wind
up
involving
testimony,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
there's
no
legitimate
expectation
of
confidentiality
within--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
daly
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
f.
daly
exactly.
mr.
john
f.
daly
yes,
but
far
more
typically
this
issue
is
raised
by
plaintiffs
saying
hypothetically
someone
might
testify,
or
might
think
that
they
might
have
to
testify,
and
therefore
there's
no
confidentiality,
and
that,
we
think,
is
simply
not
the
case.
the
problem
is
that
on
a
practical
level
the
proof
that
would
necessarily
be
needed
under
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
usually
isn't
there.
what
we
have
is
the
fact
that
someone
provided
information
to
the
fbi,
we
know
that
it
was
in
the
course
of
a
criminal
investigation.
we
think
that
the
proper
starting
point
is
that
there
is
an
implied
assurance
of
confidentiality
in
that
sort
of
encounter.
and
i'd
also
remind
the
court
that
i
think
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
gives
us
a
very
important
point
here,
and
that
particularly
involves
the
1986
amendment
to
exemption
7(d).
prior
to
that
time,
the
fbi
would
have
to
show
that
the
release
of
a
record
at
issue
would
result
in
the
disclosure
of
a
confidential
source,
or
information
from
a
confidential
source.
congress
changed
that
in
1986
to
say
that
we
need
only
show
that
the
release
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
have
such
a
result.
4
years
ago
in
a
reporters
committee,
this
court
recognized
the
significance
of
that
language,
and
in
particular
its
relationship
to
the
notion
that
the
government
may
frequently
make
its
showing
by
means
of
categorical
showings
and
not
by
item-by-item,
or
as
in
this
case,
source-by-source
showings.
think,
for
example,
of
what
is,
i'm
afraid,
a
typical
document
in
question,
an
fbi
interview
report
with
a
witness.
that
report
may
begin
that
special
agent
mary
jones
spoke
to
john
smith
of
123
main
street
on
february
24th.
smith
related
the
following
information.
and
the
document
may
then
go
on
to
give
the
information,
giving
nothing
about
the
circumstances
of
the
interview,
but
also
giving
nothing
that
would
indicate
that
the
normal
presumption
of
confidentiality
shouldn't
apply,
and
the
question
is,
what
is
the
fbi
to
do
with
that?
certainly
we
seem
not
to
be
able
to
meet
the
court
of
appeals
test
requiring
specific
circumstances
regarding
the
interview,
but
as
a
practical
starting
point
we
submit
that,
yes,
based
on
common
sense
and
based
on
the
fbi's
tradition
of
confidentiality
there
should
be
the
starting
point
that
should
be
used
by
both
the
fbi
and
a
reviewing
court
that
yes,
there
is
an
implication
of
confidentiality
there.
mr.
john
f.
daly
well,
it
certainly
goes
back
to
the
lame
decision
in
the
third
circuit
which
we
discussed.
mr.
john
f.
daly
that
was
1981,
i
believe.
unfortunately,
the
lame
decision
was
followed
by
further
third
circuit
decisions
which
seemed
to
create
some
confusion,
at
least
in
our
view,
even
early
on.
mr.
john
f.
daly
eight
circuits
have
dealt
with
it
expressly.
seven
come
in
our
favor.
the
third
circuit
stands
alone
as
coming
out
squarely
against
us
on
this
issue.
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
wiener
case
that
we
have
discussed--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--i'm
not
sure,
justice
white,
when
the
early
district
court
decisions
were.
i
know
the
case
that
we
all
now
look
to
as
being
the
seminal
case
in
the
area
is
the
seventh
circuit's
ruling
in
miller
v.
bell,
and
that
came
in
1981,
fairly
shortly
after
the
amendment
went
into
effect.
the
fbi
has
taken
a
consistent
position
on
this.
of
course,
before
1974
the
issue
didn't
arise
because
of
the
very
broad
exemption
that
they
had
under
exemption
7,
but
after
the
amendment
was
passed
in
1974,
you
can
see,
for
example,
we
cite
the
1975
memorandum
by
attorney
general
levy
which
recites
that
confident...
that
we
would
normally
be
able
to
withhold
identities
in
this--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--no,
and--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--and
since
1974,
the
fbi
has
consistently
taken
the
position
that
this
presumption
of
confidentiality
has
to
be
the
starting
point.
mr.
john
f.
daly
well,
as
i
said,
you
can
go
back
to
the
earlier
third
circuit
decisions.
we
think
there
was
some
reason
for
doubt
even
within
the
third
circuit
because
of
different
decisions,
but
apart
from
the
third
circuit,
yes,
we've
been
prevailing
all
along.
i
think
it's
important
also--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--we
readily
acknowledge,
justice
scalia,
that
it's
a
very
difficult
point,
and
there
would
be
very,
very
few
cases
in
which
the
presumption
can
be
rebutted.
we
think
that's
appropriate,
because
indeed,
this
sort
of
implied
confidentiality
is
the
norm.
there
may
be
a
few
cases--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--as
we've
noted
in
our
brief,
there
may
be
some
rare
cases,
and
we
admit
that
they're
rare,
in
which
the
presumption
may
be
rebutted.
this
happened
in
miller
v.
bell
itself.
the
seventh
circuit
found
an
unusual
circumstance
in
which
a
particular
witness
was
known
of
and
disavowed
from
the
start
any
notion
of
confidentiality.
we
admit
that
it's
going
to
be
rare,
your
honor,
but
we
also
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
policies
of
exemption
7(d)
require
protection
of
confidential
sources,
and
if
we
are
to
use
the
approach
of
the
third
circuit,
we
won't
be
able
to
do
that.
mr.
john
f.
daly
that,
unfortunately,
is
often
the
way
things
wind
up
working
under
foia,
because
the
plaintiff
never
has
the
documents
to
begin
with.
certainly,
if
there's
any
particular
reason
to
think
that
the
circumstances
are
unusual,
if
the
plaintiff
could
articulate
something,
then
perhaps
that
would
justify
in
camera
review.
that's
always
available,
and
as
we
mentioned
in
our
reply
brief
there
was
a
recent
tenth
circuit
case
in
which
we
invoked
this
theory
and
the
tenth
circuit
deemed
it
appropriate
to
look
at
the
documents
and
they
said,
yes,
we've
determined
that's
right.
i
think
in
the
absence
of
some
articulable
reason
to
think
that
there
was
something
unusual
going
on,
then
yes,
you
should
keep
to
the
presumption
that
there
is
an
implied
confidentiality
here.
mr.
john
f.
daly
if
one
looks
at
the
files
in
this
case
one
can
tell
that
we
have
not
withheld
in
that
circumstance.
one
can
look
at
the
documents
and
tell
that
information
is
from
a
source,
and--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--oh,
i
think
so,
yes.
we
would
have
to
look
at
the
documents.
mr.
john
f.
daly
certainly,
the
requester
wouldn't
know
initially.
mr.
john
f.
daly
the
entire
theory
that
we
are
advancing
in
this
case
would
simply
not
apply,
and
we
would
not--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--i'm
not
sure
that
we
specifically
addressed
in
the
affidavit
the
notion
of--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--no,
but
the
entire
theory
that
we
presented
simply
wouldn't
apply,
and
we
would
not--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--we
would
not
have
used
it--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--in
that
particular--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--that
presupposes
that
we
would
be
misrepresenting--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--no,
we've
said
more
than
that.
we
said
that
these
are
people
we
talk
to
in
the
course
of
a
criminal
investigation--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--and
that
those
people
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
confidentiality
because
of
those...
that
circumstance.
mr.
john
f.
daly
well,
i
can
represent
to
you,
justice
stevens,
that
we
would
not
be
doing
that,
and
we
view
that
as
inconsistent
with
the
representation
that
we
made
in
the
court.
mr.
john
f.
daly
perhaps
we
could...
we
could
make
a
specific
recitation
that
we
would
not
invoke
this
theory
in
the
circumstance
where
the
information
was
given
to
an
undercover
agent,
but
we
think
that
is
there
in
what
we
said,
because
our
theory
that
we
do
expound
just
simply
wouldn't
apply
in
a
case
like
that.
mr.
john
f.
daly
we
don't
view
this
affidavit
as
covering
those
instances,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
f.
daly
i
still--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--i
think
there
would
be
something
inherently
false
in
that,
because
the
theory
that
we
discuss
in
that
affidavit
would
simply
not
be
applicable
to
an
undercover
source.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--certainly,
if
there
were
an
ongoing
investigation,
exemption
7(a)
of
the
foia
would
apply,
and
as
to
the
identity
but
not
the
content
of
the
information,
exemption
7(c).
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
f.
daly
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind,
as
this
court
has
frequently
noted,
that
the
congress
intended
for
it
to
be
governed
by
workable
rules.
that
is
not
simply
a
matter
of
administrative
convenience
or
burden.
it
really
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
the
policy
of
exemption
7(d)
is
all
about.
what's
at
stake
here
is
very
important.
it's
the
fbi's
practical
ability
to
protect
confidential
sources,
and
contrary
to
what
respondent
says,
it
is
altogether
very
frequently
the
case
that
we
simply
do
not
have
the
sort
of
detailed
information
about
circumstances
of
particular
interviews,
and
even
beyond
that,
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
congress
recognized
that
the
public
needs
to
have
some
certainty,
some
real
assurance
that
the
fbi
is
able
to
protect
a
confidential
source.
that
won't
exist
if
this
issue
winds
up
being
decided
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
by
judges
who
are
frequently
approaching
the
issue
years
after
the
fact,
if
we
have
to
rely
on
showing
the
physical
circumstances
such
as
whether
the
door
was
shut
or
not,
and
also
if
we
have
to
rely
on
the
content
of
the
information,
if
we
have
to
say
district
judges
saying,
well,
a
murder
investigation
is
sensitive,
but
some
other
federal
crimes
and
federal
criminal...
federal
financial
crime
isn't.
that's
not
going
to
give
us
a
sort
of
workable
rule.
mr.
john
f.
daly
i
think
that
could
be
a
significant
burden,
because
it
would
change
the
way
the
fbi
does
business,
and--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--the...
to
be
honest,
justice
white,
i'm
not
prepared
today
to
talk
about
how
that
would
involve
day-to-day
law
enforcement
activities,
because
that's
an
issue...
that's...
it's
a
legislative
issue.
if
congress
wants
to
change
the
way
the
fbi
does
business,
then
it
may
do
so.
i
can
only
tell
you--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--well,
the
fbi
has
assured
me
that
it
would
indeed
change
the
way
that
they
do
business.
it
would
not
only
impose
a
practical
burden,
but
could
also
change
the
interaction
between
witnesses
and
the
fbi,
and
of
course,
congress
hasn't
done
that,
and
of
course--
mr.
john
f.
daly
--it's
possible,
and
it
would
do
nothing
for
our
concerns
about
existing
records.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
