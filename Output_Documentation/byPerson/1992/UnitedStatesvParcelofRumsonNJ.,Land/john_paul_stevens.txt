justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
there?
what
about
the
person
who
sold
her
the
residence
and
has
the
purchase
price?
who
owns
the
purchase
price?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
know.
it's
the
same
money.
the
money
went
to
buy
the
house,
and
that's...
used
government
money,
and
then
the
person
who
sold
the
house
received
that
money.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
person
is
receiving
government
property.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
the
drug
dealer
bought
a
house--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--then
sold
it,
and
gave
the
proceeds
to
his
companion
who
then
bought
another
house?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
the
house
is
proceeds,
and
what
about
the
money
that
the
seller
of
that
house
got?
justice
john
paul
stevens
ms.--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--ms.
wax,
does
that
mean...
i
just
want
to
be
sure,
and
i
think
that
it
really
doesn't
matter
in
this
case
that
the
woman
is
a
donee.
it
would
be
the
same
case
if
she
had
been
a
physician
who
had
performed
an
operation
on
this
man
and
got
paid
in
the
same
sum
of
money
and
then
used
the
proceeds.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
isn't
that
precisely
the
same
proceeds
that
went
to
the
doctor?
because
if
you...
is
it
you
have
to
be
a
donee
and
not
a
purchaser?
is
that
the
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
proceeds
are
only
proceeds
that
are
received
by
way
of
gift?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that...
am
i
right
or
not
on
that?
i
don't
now
why
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
your
lawyer
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--seemed
to
be
a
categorical
answer
that
if
it's
a
third
party
that
is
an
innocent...
has
no
knowledge
of
the
taint
on
the
money,
that
you
can
trace
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
don't
understand
why
the
full
value
matters
if
the
criminal
has
transferred
government
property
to
the
doctor
in
payment
of
a
debt.
i
don't
know
why
that's
different
than
giving
the
property
to
his
sister
or
brother
or
companion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
not
on
the
sale
too?
i
don't
understand.
if
you
give
it
to
the
church,
you
can
trace
it,
but
if
you...
but
if
it...
but
if
it's
a...
i
don't
understand--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
terms
of
the
language
of
the
statute.
i
understand
the
distinction,
of
course,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
xxx
applies
even
if
she
was
the
doctor
who
performed
the
services
xxx.
the
language
of
the
statute
doesn't
draw
this
distinction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
0
xxx.
what
statutory
language
do
you
rely
on
to
differentiate
between
the
doctor
who
was
paid
for
an
operation
on
the
one
hand
and
a
donee
on
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
proceeds...
if
it's
without
consideration,
but
it's
not
if
there
was
consideration?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
belong
to
the
government
under
your...
what
you
say
in
your
brief
anyway.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
belong
to
the
government
at
the
time
they
pay
the
doctor's
bill
or
they
pay
off
the
preexisting
debt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
saying
it
doubles,
but
it
certainly
singles
under
your...
the
doctor
is
paid
for
an
operation
he
performed
10
years
ago
with
drug
proceeds,
honest
debt.
are
those
proceeds
or
aren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
are
they
proceeds
or
aren't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
certainly
not
what
your
brief
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do.
you
say
that
it's
the
government's
property
at
the
time
it
came...
if
they
caught
them
right
at
the
time
when
they're
handing
in
the
check,
you'd
definitely
say
that's
government
money.
you
can't
pay
that
bill.
but
if
you
catch
the
doctor
two
days
later,
after
he
has
deposited
it
in
the
bank,
it's
no
longer
government
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your
theory
fitting
into
the
language
of
the
statute
doesn't
draw
a
distinction
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
reason
you
say
it's
proceeds
is
because
you
say
it
became
government
property
at
the
time
of
the
drug
transaction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
you
can
use
government
property
to
pay
off
debts,
but
you
can't
give
it
away.
that's
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
there's
an
argument
as
to
what
you
mean
as
to
xxx.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
you.
what's
your
position
as...
on
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
do
you
think
in
the
hypothetical
case
of
an
act
performed
without
the
knowledge
of
the
ultimate
owner,
the
woman
here,
but
she
found
out
about
the
act
before
the
time
of
the
gift,
would
she
be
able
to
plead
innocent
ownership
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
here?
this
section
6
of
881
does
include
in
part
instrumentalities,
as
well
as
proceeds,
as
i
understand
it.
securities
used
are
intended
to
be
to
facilitate
any
violation
of
the
chapter.
does
that...
is
there
another
section
also
dealing
with
instrumentalities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
part
of
6
seems
to
deal
with...
securities
used
as
instrumentalities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
7
deals
i
guess
generally
with
the
problem
of
property
owned
by
someone
other
than
the
criminal
enterprise
before
the
transactions
that
gave
rise
to
the
justification
for
forfeiture.
in
other
words,
if
you
own
a
boat
and
you
lend
it
to
somebody
and
they
engage
in
a
drug
transaction,
the
boat
would
be
forfeitable,
but
not
if
the
owner
of
the
boat
had
no
idea
what
was
being
done
with
it.
that's
what
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
proceeds
has
a
whole
different
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
1978,
the
congress
amended
the
comprehensive
drug
abuse
prevention
and
control
act
to
provide
for
the
forfeiture
of
proceeds,
traceable
to
money
or
other
things
of
value
earned
from
drug
trafficking.
this
case
raises
questions
concerning
the
innocent
owner
in
defense
that
is
included
in
that
amendment.
one
of
the
defense
is
available
through
donee
as
well
as
a
bona
fide
purchaser.
and
whether,
as
the
government
contends,
it
may
only
be
asserted
by
a
person
who
own
the
property
before
the
conduct
justifying
the
forfeiture
occurred.
in
1982,
the
respondent
received
a
gift
of
approximately
$240,000
dollars
that
she
used
to
purchase
the
home
that
she
and
her
three
children
have
occupied
ever
since.
in
1989,
based
on
probable
cause
to
believe
that
the
funds
used
to
buy
the
house
were
proceeds
of
illegal
drug
transactions.
the
government
instituted
this
forfeiture
proceeding.
in
defense
respondents
claimed
to
be
an
innocent
owner,
because
she
had
no
knowledge
of
the
origin
of
the
money.
without
passing
on
the
credibility
of
her
claim,
the
district
court
held
that
her
defense
was
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law,
because
she
had
received
the
purchase
price
as
a
gift,
and
because
she
had
not
acquired
the
property
until
after
the
alleged
drug
transactions
occurred.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded
for
an
evidentiary
hearing,
and
we
granted
the
government's
petition
for
certiorary.
the
government
does
not
press
the
argument
that
the
defense
is
only
available
to
bona
fide
purchasers.
persumably,
because
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
contains
no
such
limitation.
the
government
does
however
argued
that
it
becomes
the
owner
of
drug
proceeds
as
soon
as
an
illegal
transaction
takes
place,
and
that
respondent's
home
was
therefore
purchased
with
the
government
property.
we
reject
that
argument
because
both
the
common
law
and
the
statutory
relation
back
doctrine,
on
which
the
government
relies,
only
provide
for
a
retroactive
vesting
of
title
after
the
government
has
obtained
the
forfeiture
judgment.
until
that
time,
the
government
is
not
the
owner
of
the
property,
and
the
person
such
as
respondent,
who
does
own
the
property
until
then,
may
involve
to
any
defense
otherwise
available
to
her.
my
opinion
announcing
the
judgment
of
court
is
joined
by
justice
blackmun,
justice
o'connor
and
justice
souter.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
that
is
joined
by
justice
thomasa
and
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
that
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
white.
