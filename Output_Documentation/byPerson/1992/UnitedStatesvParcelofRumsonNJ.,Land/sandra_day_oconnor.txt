well,
ms.
wax,
would
your...
how
does
your
theory
play
out
in
terms
of
any
mortgage
that
has
been
put
on
the
house?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
government
take
the
property
subject
to
the
mortgage
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
it's
a...
it's
an
ordinary
lending
institution
that
had
no
way
of
knowing--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
the
proceeds
used
to
make
the
down
payment
were
those
of
a
drug
transaction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
the
money
was
paid
to
the
bank.
and
would
you
go
back
again
to
the
bank
that
puts
a
mortgage
on
a
house
that
somehow
was
acquired
with
some
drug
proceeds?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
would
take
the
position
that
the
house
belongs
to
the
government.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
does
it
take
just
the
equity,
and
is
it
free
and
clear
of
the
mortgage,
or
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
happens
to
the
mortgage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
do
not
take
the
position
that
it
takes
it
free
and
clear
of
the
mortgage.
