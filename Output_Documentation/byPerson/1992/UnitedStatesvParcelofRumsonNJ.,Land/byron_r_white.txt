well,
suppose
a
legitimate
businessman
goes
in
debt
to
a
bank,
and
he
has
never
been
in
the
drug
business
before,
but
he's
really
squeezed.
and
so,
he...
he's
going
to
get
into
an
illegal
enterprise
and
pay
off
his
debts,
and
he
gets
in
the
drug
business.
and
he
makes
a
lot
of
money,
and
he
takes
that
money,
which
i
take
it
belongs
to
the
government,
and
pays
off
the
bank.
can
the...
is
it
the
government's
position
that
the...
you
can
get
the
money
back
from
the
bank?
completely
legitimate
debt
at
the
outset.
he...
they
weren't
financing
his
drug
business.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
financing
his
manufacturing
concern.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's...
if...
the
money
is
surely
the
proceeds
of
the
drug
business,
and
they...
and
it's
traceable
right
to
the
bank.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
with
the
doctor?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
doctor?
the
money
is
in
the
hands
of
the
doctor,
just
like
the
money
is
in
the
hands
of
the
bank.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
what's
your
answer
to
the
hard
case,
the
bank?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
certainly--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it...
certainly
it
had
an
interest.
it
certainly
acquired
the
debt
long
before
the
fellow
ever
got
in
the
drug
business,
but
they
didn't
acquire
any
lien
on
the
money.
justice
byron

xxx.
suppose
the
defendant
has
set
up
an
irrevocable
trust
for
his
minor
children,
age
2
and
3,
and
it's
irrevocable
and
it's
a
gift
to
the
children,
but
it
just
happens
to
be
in
trust.
and
you
say
that
that
is
protected
by
the
innocent
owner.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
any
lawyer
would
say
that
he
has
no
control
over
that
trust.
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
assume
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
government
could
not
recover
the
funds
that
are
in
trust.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
gave
this
house
away
to
avoid
a
palimony
suit.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
safely.
could
happen...
he
could
safely
set
it
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
suppose
that
if...
even
if
you
took
the
bona
fide
purchaser
for
value
approach
in
defining
an
owner,
i
suppose
that
you
could
make
an
argument
that
this...
the
lady
involved
in
this
case
gave
some
value.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
in
most
states,
you
would
say...
or
in
a
lot
of
states,
it
would
be
jointly
held
property.
