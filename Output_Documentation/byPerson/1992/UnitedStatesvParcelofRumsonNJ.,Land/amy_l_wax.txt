ms.
amy
l.
wax
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
scope
of
the
statutory
innocent
owner
defense
to
a
forfeiture
of
property
under
21
u.s.c.
881(a)(6),
the
statute
authorizing
civil
in
rem
forfeiture
of
proceeds
of
illegal
drug
transactions.
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
that
someone
like
respondent
beth
ann
goodwin
who
receives
a
gift
of
drug
profits
and
uses
that
money
to
purchase
real
property
cannot
assert
a
defense
to
forfeiture
that
is
only
available
to
innocent
owners
because
that
person
does
not
own
the
property.
under
federal
forfeiture
statutes,
title
to
property
vests
irreversibly
in
the
government
when
the
act
giving
rise
to
forfeiture
is
committed.
the
united
states
owns
the
property
from
that
point
forward,
and
its
interests
cuts
off
all
rights,
including
ownership
rights,
for
anyone
who
subsequently
acquires
the
property.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
precisely,
your
honor.
someone
has
to
have
a
preexisting,
valid
ownership
interest
before
the
acts
giving
rise
to
forfeiture
occur
so
that
someone
like
ms.
goodwin
is
really
in
no
better
position,
someone
who
receives
the
gift
of
drug
profits,
than
someone
who
receives
stolen
money,
a
gift
of
stolen
property.
that
person
has
no
right
to
the
property
as
against
its
true
owner
however
innocently
it
was
acquired.
so,
in
this
case
respondent
beth
ann
goodwin
is
not
the
owner
of
the
$200,000
in
drug
profits
that
she
received
from
her
companion,
mr.
brenna,
nor
does
she
own
the
residence
that
she
purchased
with
that
money.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
your
honor,
our
position...
that
is
a...
really
an
entirely
different
question.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
the
answer
to
that
question
lies
we
believe
not
in
construction
of
the
innocent
owner
defense,
but
in
what
the
word
"proceeds"
means.
if
there
is
a
bilateral
transaction,
such
as
her
buying
the
house
from
somebody
and
that
person
receiving
the
money,
the
question
is
does
the
word
"proceeds"
cover
both
sides
of
that
bilateral,
full-value
transaction,
or
does
it
only
cover
one
side.
we
think
that
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
word
"proceeds"
would
cover
just
the
house
that
she
received
and
not
necessarily
the
money
that
the
particular
seller
received.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
okay.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
no.
in
that
case,
when
the
drug
dealer
bought
the
house,
he
got
a
house
which,
in
effect,
was
substituted
for
his
original
profits.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that's
proceeds
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
that's
derivative
assets,
and
that
is
proceeds--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--that...
we
think
a
fair
construction
of
proceeds
is
that
that's
not
proceeds.
in
light
of...
in
the
civil
statute,
in
light
of
the
narrow
innocent
owner
defense,
we
think
that
the
word
"proceeds"
arguably
does
not
cover
the
money
that
goes
to
a
seller
if
it's
a
bona
fide
transaction,
there's
no
collusion,
it's
in
good
faith,
and
there's
full
value.
so,
your
honor,
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
if
there's
help
for
bona
fide
purchasers
in
this
statute,
we
don't
think
the
help
lies
in
twisting
the
innocent
owner
defense
to
apply
to
after-acquirers
of
property
or
persons
who
acquire
their
interest
after
the
offense
takes
place.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
the
mortgage...
the
answer
would
be,
under
the
theory
i
just
stated,
probably
no
in
the
sense
that
if
the
mortgage
is
a
true
business-like
mortgage
by
just
any
old
bank
or--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
well,
there
are
three
answers
to
that
mortgagee.
the
first
answer,
as
reflected
in
my
answer
to
justice
stevens
is,
it
may
well
be
that
the
lien
or
the
lien
interest
that
mortgagee
holds
is
not
really
proceeds
if
he
gave
cash
to
the
person
who
owned
the
house.
i
mean,
that
would
seem
to
follow.
so,
what
in
effect
i'm
saying,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
to
the
extent
that
mortgagees
and
lienors
and
other
true
bona
fide
purchasers
are
concerned
about
what
our
position
is
in
this
case,
they
may
well
be
fighting
the
battle
on
the
wrong
front.
they're
trying--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--we
certainly
think
that's
possible,
your
honor,
that
that...
the
issue
of
a
comprehensive
theory
of
proceeds
is
not
directly
presented
by
this
situation
because
ms.
goodwin's
house
is
proceeds
under
a
narrow
theory,
under
a
broad
theory,
under
any
plausible
theory.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
definitely.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
no.
the
cash
is
covered.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
i
think
what
we're...
the
cash
is
covered
because
i
originally
bought
the
house
with
my
drug
profits.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that
house
is
covered.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
the
house
is
proceeds.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
i
sell
the
house
and
i
receive
for
that
house
cash.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
okay?
that
cash
is
proceeds
because
it
is
what
i'm
receiving,
in
effect,
in
exchange
for
my
drug
profits
down
the
line.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i
am
benefitted--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
okay.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
your
honor,
i
think
what's
confusing
people
is
that
under
conventional
tenets
of
forfeiture
law,
once
a
thing
becomes
tainted,
a
res
becomes
tainted,
it's
tainted
forever.
okay?
and
that's
one
of
the
predicates
of
our
argument
in
this
case.
what
i'm
saying
is
it's
possible
that
through
the
definition
of
the
word
"proceeds",
what
proceeds
means,
in
effect,
congress
sort
of
negated
that
to
the
extent
that
if
there's
a
full-value
exchange...
if
the
government
can
go
after
one-half
of
that
full-value
exchange,
in
effect,
the
taint
is
purged
from
the
other
half.
i
guess
that's
what
i'm
saying,
but
that's
a
matter
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
"proceeds",
not
a
wholesale
suspension
of
the
common
law
conventions
of
forfeiture.
and
the
reason
why
it's
important
that
there
not
be
a
wholesale
suspension
in
this
case
is
that
that
convention
is
not
suspended
when
assets
migrate
from
the
original
drug
dealer
into
the
hands
of
a
person
who
receives
it
as
a
gift.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
caplin
&
drysdale
concerns
section
853(c),
which
is
the
criminal
forfeiture
provision
that
deals
with
proceeds,
cash,
and
in
that
case,
of
course,
the
question
was
whether
money
that
the
drug
dealer
wanted
to
pay
to
his
lawyer,
whether
the
relation-back
provision
applied
to
that,
and
the
court
said
absolutely,
positively
it
applies
to
that.
the
minute
the
cash
is
generated
through
a
drug
transaction,
it
belongs
to
the
united
states,
and
you
know,
to
quote
the
court,
there's
no
right
to
give
someone
else's
money
to
a
third
party.
so,
yes.
the
answer
is
yes
in
caplin
&
drysdale.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
i'm
not
aware
right
off
the
top
of
my
head
of
a
case
in
which
this
court
has.
certainly
it
has
been
common
practice
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
not
in
any
case
of
this
court
that
i'm
aware
of.
but,
your
honor,
to...
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
words
of
the
statute
to
see
that
there's
nothing
unusual
or
disturbing
about
that.
the
whole...
the
statute
was
designed...
that
was
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute,
to
enable
the
government
to
take
assets
that
are
substituted
for
the
original
drug
profits.
that's
the
meaning
of
the
proceeds
traceable
to
an
exchange
language
in
881(a)(6).
and
the
reason
for
that
is
if
the
government
couldn't
do
that,
then
someone,
a
drug
dealer,
could
take
his
profits
and
essentially
shelter
them
by
just
putting
them
through
one
transaction.
he'd
just
have
to
buy
something
with
the
profits,
and
then
the
government
couldn't
touch
it.
so,
it
must
be
the
case
that
the
government
can
take
the
thing
that
the
person
who
holds
the
profits
buys
with
those
profits,
the
jaguar,
the
fur
coat,
the
diamond
ring,
the
house,
whatever--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
your
honor--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--but,
your
honor,
we
clearly...
the
statute
clearly
allows
you
to
do
that
here
because
the
statute
says
that
all
things
of
value
furnished
in
exchange
for
drugs
are
forfeitable.
it
doesn't
say
all
things
of
value
that
are
in
the
hands
of
a
drug
dealer.
it
doesn't
qualify
it
based
on,
you
know,
who's
in
possession,
and
certainly--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--black
letter
forfeiture
law
is
it
doesn't
matter
who
holds--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--the
answer
to
that
is
no.
those
people--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--are
in
different
positions.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
okay,
well,
i
guess
we're
saying
yes
to
that,
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
if
we
construe
the
word
"proceeds"
so
that
it
doesn't
keep
propagating
endlessly--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--in
this
case
we're
dealing
with
profits--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--no.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
the
answer
is
no.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
proceeds
can
be
two
sorts
of
things,
your
honor.
they
can
be
something
that's
tainted
and
then
is
given
by
gift
where
there's
no
full-value
bilateral
exchange.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it's
different
for
the
following
reason.
if
you
give
the
profits
to
someone
else
or
the
proceeds
to
someone
else
and
that
means
that
the
government
can
no
longer...
the
fact
that
you're
giving
it
to
someone
else
means
the
government
can
no
longer
take
it,
that
would
undermine
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute
simply
by
giving--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--okay.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
precisely.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
i
couldn't
have
said
it
better
myself.
[laughter]
the
point
is
there
has
got
to--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--we
think
that
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
word...
we're
not
talking
about
the
innocent
owner
defense
here,
which
is
the
subject
of
this
case.
i'm
interpreting
the
word
"proceeds",
and
i'm
giving
what
i
think
might
be
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
word
"proceeds"
in
light
of
an
innocent
owner
defense
that
cuts
off
the
rights
of
after-acquirers
of
property.
and
we...
the
government
is
not
standing
here
claiming
both
sides
of
every
transaction
that
involves
proceeds,
so
that
proceeds
propagates
endlessly
throughout
the
whole
economy.
we
think
that
what
congress
probably
meant
by
proceeds
was
that
body
of
assets
that's
the
surrogate
for
the
original
profits
no
matter
how
many
exchanges
it
goes
through.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that's
a
hard
one.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that's
a
really
difficult
case
there.
it's
sort
of
like
i
think
the
case--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right,
right.
well,
in
that
case,
there
isn't
a
body
of
assets
that
the
government
can
go
after.
so--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--i
mean,
in
the
hands
of
the
person
who
originally--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
that's
the
hard
case,
your
honor,
and
i
think
we
might
have
to
answer
it
by
saying
it's
a
little
bit
like
when
the
drug
dealer
smokes
his
marijuana.
i
mean,
it
has
gone
up
in
smoke
and--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
i
think
on
the...
i
think
to
be
consistent,
we
might
have
to
say
that
since
the
bank...
i
mean,
it
gave
value
in
the
sense
that
it
gave
him
a
discharge
of
his
debts,
maybe
not
in
the
form
that
we
could
take,
but
it
did
give
the
full
value
if
it
was
a
bona
fide...
you
know,
course
of
business
exchange--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--that
the
bank
would
have
a
good
argument
that
we
couldn't
take
the
money
from
them.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i
think,
your
honor,
that
we
would
try
and
get
the
money.
the
drug
dealer
got
benefit
when
he
paid
off
his
debts,
and
we
would
try
and
get
the
money
from
him
if
we
could
because
he
received
value.
that
would
be
our
policy
not
just
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--okay.
let's
take
a
case
where
a...
cash
was
paid
for
a
house.
the
cash
was
drug
profits,
in
fact,
as
in
this
case.
and
then
the
person
who
owns
the
house
takes
out
a
mortgage
as
a
home
equity
loan
on
the
house.
actually
that
did
happen
in
this
case.
the
bank
gives
her
cash
and
it
takes
back
a
security
interest.
i
think
that
on
our
theory,
the
proceeds
would
attach
to
one-half
of
the
transaction.
we
could
go
after
the
cash
or,
you
know,
the
value
of
the
house
that
represents
it
if
she
put
it
into
the
house,
and
then
the
bank
wouldn't
be
holding
an
interest
that's
proceeds.
so,
once
again,
i'm
saying
that--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
would
take
that
part
of
the
equity--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--that
was
not
represented
by
the
mortgage.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
in
that
case,
if
we
were
to
apply
proceeds...
well,
let
me
back
up.
the
mortgagee
would
have
to
establish
a
few
things
in
order
to
get
out
from
under
the
word
"proceeds".
i
think
they'd
have
to
establish
that
they
gave,
you
know,
full
value,
that
the
loan
was
legitimate,
that
kind
of
thing.
and
then
they'd
have
a
good
argument
that
their
interest
wasn't
proceeds,
or
in
any
event,
they
would
get
remission
under
the
remission
and
mitigation
regulations.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
no.
the
money
that
the
person
who
took
the
mortgage,
the
mortgagor,
the
money
that
they
received
in
cash
in
exchange
for
the
security
interest,
the
government
would
go
after
that.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
okay,
that's
a
different
case
from
the
one
justice
o'connor
presented.
that's
a
case
where
we
have
clean
money
and
dirty
money
mixed
together--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--to
purchase
an
asset.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
and
the
government's
position
is
that
we
get
the
value
of
the
house
to
the
extent
of
the
dirty
money
and
not
of
the
clean
money,
and
the
mortgagee
gets...
you
know,
when
we
sell
the
house,
they
get
back
their
clean
money
as
long
as
the
drug
dealer
didn't
make
his
mortgage
payments
with
dirty
money.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i
believe
that
the
answer
is
that
each
entity,
the
government
to
the
extent
they
have
an
interest,
the
mortgage...
the
mortgagee
to
the
extent
they
do,
take
the
loss
proportionately
on
that
decline
in
the
equity
of
the
house.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--the
government...
what
we're
essentially
saying
here
is
that
as
a
matter
of...
first
of
all,
when
a
bona
fide
mortgagee
comes
in
and
claims
their
interest
in
a
house,
as
a
routine
matter,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
we
pay
them
off.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
i
think
that
the
reading...
the
construction
we've
given
you
of
the
word
"proceeds"...
under
that
construction,
i
think
that
the
bank
could
well
claim
that
we
don't
have
the
power
because
they've
given
full
value
for
their
interest
back
to
the
original
owner
of
the
profits.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
and
we
have
to
go
after
that.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
no.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
no,
we're
not
saying
that.
let
me
give
you
an
example
why
we're
not
saying
that.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
retain
the
right
to
trace
proceeds
into
third
party
hands
sometimes
when
there
has
been
an
exchange.
for
example,
suppose
mr.
brenna
in
this
case
took
his
$200,000
and
gave
it
to
his
brother-in-law
for
a
jaguar
that
was
only
worth
$30,000.
we
would
reserve
the
right
to
trace
the
$170,000
that
represents
the
difference,
the
difference
between
that
amount
and
the
value
of
the
jaguar,
into
his
brother-in-law's
hands
because
essentially
it's
a
gift
just
like
here
it's
a
gift
to
ms.
brenna.
the
drug
profits
were
a
gift
to
her.
we
can
follow
them
into
her
hands.
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
prevents
us
from
doing
that,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
we
can't
read--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--your
honor,
you
do
not
follow
assets
into
the
hands
of
a
donee,
okay,
because
it's
the
same
assets.
they
haven't
changed.
they've
just
moved.
so,
when
she
received
that
money,
she
had
profits.
when
she
bought
the
house,
she
had
proceeds.
she
was
not
the
owner
of
either
one
of
those
because
the
government
took
title
to
them
when
the
forfeitable
acts
were
committed,
and
that
is
our
position.
so,
she
is
cut
off.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
not
in
the
innocent
owner
defense,
your
honor.
we
agree
with
that.
the
innocent
owner
defense
does
not
draw--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
we
think
that
the
word...
we
have
to
construe
the
word
"proceeds".
what
does
the
word
"proceeds"
mean?
that's
what
we--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
the
point
is
proceeds
is
the
body
of
assets
equivalent
in
value
to
the
original
profits.
okay?
the
question
is--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
all--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--we're
only
suggesting,
your
honor,
that
every
transaction
doesn't
necessarily
double,
quadruple.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
he
gave
good
value.
he
gave
it
in
services.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
i
think
under
the
theory
that
we've
advanced
of
the
word
"proceeds",
they
may
not
be.
they
probably
wouldn't
be.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
no,
your
honor.
we
don't
say
anything
that
contradicts
this
position
in
our
briefs.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
only
say
that
with
regard
to
recipients
of
gifts,
your
honor,
and
if
you
look
at
our
brief,
that's
what
we
say.
we
don't
say
anything
about
bona
fide
purchasers.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we're
only
saying
that
the
word
"proceeds"
may
draw
a
distinction,
but
the
innocent
owner
defense
doesn't
draw
a
distinction
between
the
two.
that's...
we
discuss
the
innocent
owner
defense.
we
say
that
with
respect
to
recipients
of
gifts,
that
it
remains
proceeds,
and
we
don't
say
anything
about
bona
fide
purchasers
except
for
that
in
that
case--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--exactly,
and
that's...
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
word
"proceeds"--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--if
what
you
get
back
is
something
that...
because
what
you
get
back
is
something
that
the
government
can
take.
you
can
use
the--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
that's
true
and
that's
the
case
that
is
the
hard
case.
and
we
have
to
reconcile
that
with
the
proceeds
language.
i
admit
that's
the
hard
case,
but
when...
but
the
bona
fide
purchasers
who
actually
give
value
back
to
a
drug
dealer,
there's
something
that
we
can
take,
as
you
yourself
said,
justice
souter.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
justice
scalia
was
right,
that
we
haven't
focused
very
much
on
the
language
of
the
statute.
so,
it's
that
to
which
i'd
like
to
turn
right
now.
the
term
ms.
ann...
ms.
goodwin's
house
in
this
case.
there
can
be
no
question
about
that.
now,
since
it
applies,
this
house
and
the
money
used
to
buy
that
house,
i
should
say,
belonged
to
the
united
states
at
the
time
that
it
was
generated
through
an
illegal
transaction,
and
that
follows
from
section
881(h)
of
the
statute
vesting
title
in
the
united
states
in
all
assets
described
in
subsection
(a)(6),
all
things
of
value,
all
proceeds
traceable
to
such
an
exchange,
including
the
subcategory
of
assets
that
is
ultimately
exempted
from
forfeiture
because
it
belongs
to
an
innocent
owner.
now,
since
the
united
states
gets
title
to
that
property
upon
commission
of
illegal
acts,
she
cannot
be
owner.
