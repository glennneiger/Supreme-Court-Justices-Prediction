justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
wax,
let
me
understand
what
the
government's
position
is
now.
if
i
get
money
in
an
illegal
transaction
and
buy
a
house
with
that
money--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
house
is
covered.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
the
house
is
then
sold
for
cash,
that
cash
is
not
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
house
continues
to
be
covered
all
the
way
down
the
line.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
then
the
house
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
house
is
proceeds.
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
the
house
is
sold
and
it's
converted
back
into
cash.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
would
be
true
of
the
person
that
i
sold
the
house
to,
though.
suppose
i
sell
the
house,
instead
of
keeping
it.
i
get...
from
the
transaction
i
get
cash.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
buy
a
house
with
the
cash.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
then
sell
the
house
to
somebody.
you
say
the
cash
i
get
back
would
be
proceeds
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
house
is
still
covered.
why
isn't
the
sale
of
that
house
proceeds
to
the
person
who
sells
the
house?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
as
i
understand
you.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
we
ever
applied
the
relation-back
doctrine,
relation-back
forfeiture,
to
anything
except
physical
property--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
contradistinction
to
cash?
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
oh,
go
ahead.
excuse
me.
but
that...
it
was
still
in
the
hands
of
the
dealer.
i'm
talking
about
have
we
ever
followed
the
money
to
a
later
person
and
said
that
the
forfeiture
of
that
money
subsists?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
aware
that
we've
done
it.
have
we
ever
followed
that
money
to
the
purchase
of
real
estate
and
then
followed
the
real
estate
the
rest
of
the
way
down
the
line
when
the
real
estate
was
not
part
of
the
initial
proceeds?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
hands
of
the
wrongdoer,
yes,
but
it's
something
else
to
follow
it
all
the
way
down
the
chain
from
then
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
say,
we've
never...
to
my
knowledge,
we've
never
done
that
except
in
the
case
where
the
offending
property
itself
is
involved,
not
cash.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
wax,
could
i
come
back
to
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical?
it
seems
to
me
you
made
the
answer
easy
by
assuming
that
the
woman,
when
she
sold
the...
when
she
mortgaged
the
house,
put
the
money
into
the
house
or
put
the
money
in
the
bank.
and,
therefore,
you
say,
we'd
go
after
the
money,
and
the
bank
would
still
have
its
mortgage
in
the
real
estate.
but
that
isn't
really
what
happens
normally,
of
course.
she
didn't
put
the
money
in
the
house
or
in
the
bank.
she
spent
it
on
men,
women,
and
song...
or
men...
wine,
men,
and
song.
[laughter]
and
it's
all
gone.
then
what
does
the
government
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
the
government
goes
after
the
bank's
interest
in
the
house,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
law,
not
policy.
i
know
you're
very
generous
and
you
wouldn't
do
it.
[laughter]
but
your
contention
is,
is
it
not,
that
you
would
have
the
power
to
do
it
under
your
reading
of
this
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
a
new
position
then.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
there
are
any
proceeds
that
can
be
substituted
for
the
real
estate
at
all.
you're
saying
a
bfp
always
prevails.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
bfp
doesn't
prevail
when
the
bfp
is
a
doctor.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
understand
what
you
are
saying
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
a
lot
easier
simply
to
read
the
word
"owner"
to
mean
the
person
who
would
be
the
owner
but
for
this
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
these
problems
disappear,
and
i
must
say
i'm...
i
just
don't
understand
what
the
government's
position
is
at
this
point.
i'm
very
confused
about
when
you
get
it,
when
you
follow
it,
when
you
don't
follow
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
have
been
committed.
so,
if
i
commit
the
fraudulent
act
and
i
take
the
proceeds
and
i
give
it
to
my
brother
and
i
say,
brother
of
mine,
i've
committed
a
fraudulent
act,
these
are
the
proceeds,
take
them
and
run,
he
is
an
innocent
owner
under
this
provision.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
my
act
was
committed...
he
can
establish
that
the
act
to
have
been
committed
without
his
knowledge
or
consent.
justice
antonin
scalia
read
the
language
again,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
extent
of
the
interest
of
an
owner
by
reason
of
any
act
or
omission...
that
would
be
the
crime--
justice
antonin
scalia
--established
by
that
owner
to
have
been
committed
or
omitted
without
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
that
owner.
the
brother
in
that
case
could
say
this
act
was
committed
without
my
knowledge
or
consent.
i
didn't
know
anything
about
it
when
it
was
committed.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
says
to
have
been
committed
without
his
consent,
not
that
he
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
of
its
commission.
it
said
it
was...
he
has
to
establish
that
it
was
committed
without
his
knowledge
or
consent.
that's
a
very
strange
innocent
owner.
i
suppose
the
question
is
whether
those
words
modify
"establish"
or
modify
"committed".
established?
if
they
establish
that
he
didn't
have
the
knowledge
at
the
time
xxx
established
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
very
logical,
but
we
have...
so,
you're
arguing
logic
the
same
way
the
united
states
is.
i
wish
somebody
would
try
to
apply
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
interpreted
the
word
"owner"
in
that
last
provision,
to
the
extent
of
the
interest
of
an
owner,
to
mean
someone
who
has
somehow
cancelled
out
the
united
states'
claim
by
having
paid
money
for
it
so
that
all...
the
united
states
could
go
and
reclaim
any
gifts
at
all,
you'd
have
to
show
that
some
value
was
given.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
anything
terrible
about
that.
why
should
the
brother
who,
even
if
he
didn't
know
about
the
illegal
transaction...
why
should
he
keep
the
ship
that
was
ill-gotten?
justice
antonin
scalia
no
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
he
doesn't.
let's
assume
he
doesn't
know.
why
shouldn't
the
united
states
still
be
able
to
take
the
house
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
easy
come,
easy
go.
he
didn't
pay
anything
for
it.
what's
the
harm?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
say
he
has
no
cognizable,
legal,
or
equitable
interest
if
he
takes
something
that
would
otherwise
belong
to
the
united
states
without
him
paying
any
value
for
it.
a
bank
who
mortgaged
it
could
recover
or
somebody
who
bought
it
could
recover,
but
he's
not
an
owner
if
he
got
as
a
gift.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
how
that
problem
of
an
individual
having
no
right
to
trace
funds
just
exists
with
respect
to
the
government...
government's
example
and
doesn't
exist
later
down
the
line
where
you
would
apply
the
same
clause
to
funds
that
have
been
taken
by
the
government.
why
doesn't
the
same
problem
exist
for
you?
i
don't
see
why
that's
the
government's
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
that
the
private
owner
of
funds
cannot
trace
funds.
only
the
government
can
trace
funds
for
some
reason.
right?
that's
how
you
shoot
down
the
government's
argument,
assuming
this
only
applies
to
funds.
of
course,
it
applies
to
other
things
of
value
as
well,
ships
and
so
forth.
but
just
speaking
of
funds,
why
doesn't
the
same
problem
exist
under
your
theory
later
on?
funds
are--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
client
takes
the
funds,
puts
them...
takes
them
over
to
the
bank,
gives
them
to
the
bank.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
seizes
them
from
the
bank.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
she
get
them
back?
she
can't
because
you
say
private
individuals
can't
trace
funds.
only
the
government
can
trace
funds.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
