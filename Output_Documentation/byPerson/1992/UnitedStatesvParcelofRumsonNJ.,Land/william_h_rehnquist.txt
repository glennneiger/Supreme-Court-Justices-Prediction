chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
91-781,
united
states
v.
a
parcel
of
land.
ms.
wax,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
the
innocent
owner
defense
is
available
only
to
someone
in
the
chain
of
title
before
the
forfeiture
occurs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
assuming--
--if
it
did
that,
then
the
government
would
get
only
the
drug
dealer's
down
payment
out
of
the
house,
so
to
speak,
and
the
purchase
money
mortgage
would
not
go
to
the
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
some
of
these
examples
have
been
perhaps
repetitive,
but
they
do
have
little
factual
variations.
suppose
that
a
drug
dealer
puts
a
$10,000
down
payment
on
a
house--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--with
money
that
is
the
proceeds
of
drug
operations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
order
to
finance
the
full
purchase
of
the
house,
he
gets
a
purchase
money
mortgage
from
an
innocent
bank,
say,
in
the
amount
of
$250,000.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
in
a
forfeiture
proceeding,
what's
the
outcome
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
outcome?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
the
house
doesn't
sell
for
the
full
amount
of
the
down
payment
plus
the
purchase
money
mortgage.
who
gets
priority?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
wax.
mr.
plaisted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
none
of
that
makes
a
donee
an
innocent
owner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
to
do
some
interpolation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
drug
dealer
gave
the
money
to
his
brother?
now,
you
can
say
forfeiting
it
from
his
brother
isn't
going
to
advance
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
yet,
clearly
if
this
statute
means
anything,
it
means
that...
at
least
to
me,
that
if
he
gives
it
to
his
brother,
it's
subject
to
forfeiture.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
are
you
getting
this
congressional
intent
that
you're
talking
about?
from
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
where
do
you
get
it
out
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
also
say
that
the
test
they
drafted,
mr.
plaisted,
tends
to
be
a
retrospective
one
by
the
use
of
the
language
"to
have
been
committed"
or
"committed".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
guy
has
enough
money
to
set
up
this
trust,
he's
got
enough
money
to
buy
a...
hire
a
good
lawyer
and
take
very
substantial
advantage
or
make
sure
that
he
has
no
control
over
it,
and
thereby
he
supports
his
little
children
with
the
proceeds
from
drug
money.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
plaisted.
ms.
wax,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wax.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-781,
united
states
versus
a
parcel
of
land
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
