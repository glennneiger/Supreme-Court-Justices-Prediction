mr.
james
a.
plaisted
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
my
name
is
jim
plaisted,
and
i
represent
the
respondent,
beth
ann
goodwin.
if
i
may,
i
don't
believe
any
of
the
many
older
cases
that
this
court
has
rendered
decision
in
has
ever
construed
an
innocent
owner
provision
nor
proceeds.
in
fact,
i
mean,
it
is
fascinating,
if
i
may
for
a
moment.
if
you
go
back
to
chief
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
grundy
and
thornburgh,
you
find
that
in
that
case,
he
talks
about
proceeds.
he
talks
about
many
of
the
things
that
have
come
up
here.
and
what
he
says
in
his
efforts
to
protect
an
innocent
owner,
a
bona
fide
purchaser,
in
that
case,
which
he
did,
which
he
says,
look,
this
statute
which
was...
it's
different
because
it
doesn't
say
proceeds,
but
it
says
the
ship,
which
was
falsely
registered,
is
forfeit
or
its
value
is
forfeit.
and
then
they
sued
the
purchaser
for
the
proceeds
that
he
had
transferred
the
ship
for,
and
justice
marshall
said
the
statute
doesn't
have
"proceeds"
in
it.
and
we
don't
have
a
statute
that
has
proceeds
in
it
for
another
160
years
or
so,
until
we
start
to
get
these
most
recent
criminal
statutes.
he...
and
civil
statutes
or
quasi-criminal
statutes,
as
this
court
often
calls
them.
what
he
also
says
is
that
in
such
a
statute...
and
the
way
he
protected
the
innocent
owner
there,
despite
the
fact
that
none
of
these
older
statutes
ever
have
innocent
owner
provisions
either...
he
protected
the
innocent
owner,
the
bona
fide
purchaser,
by
saying,
well,
the
government
had
an
election
in
this
case.
and
that's...
i
thought
i
detected
a
fair
shift
in
the
government's
positions
from
the
brief,
but
at
the
least
they
leave
themselves
with
an
election.
and
they
leave
themselves
with
an
election
to
go
after
proceeds
in
different
people's
hands.
that
concept
threatens
house
transactions
where
there
is
a
person
who
is
involved
in
drugs
in
the
chain
of
title
for
later
purchasers.
it
threatens
resales
of
cars
that
also
are
sometimes
and
often
involved
in
the
drug
trade
and
then
later
are
resold.
and
so,
congress,
when
it
adopted
this
provision
about
traceability
in
this
particular
statute...
and
i
presume
in
the
others...
it
adopted
as
well
a
protective
device
so
that
we
didn't
have
unfair
takings
from
people
who
were
innocent.
and
what
they
said...
and
it's
a...
it's
not
statement
simply
from
somebody
on
the
floor.
it's
not
a...
just
one
of
the
house
reports.
in
the
joint
statement...
because
this
was
a
bill
that
was
passed
in
the
house,
and
then
the
senate's
words
were
put
into
it
in
this
particular
pertinent
provisions,
that
is,
with
respect
to
the
innocent
owner
provision
and
i
believe
with
respect
to
proceeds
as
well
when
it
was
adopted
in
1978.
they
said
a
couple
things
that
reflect
what
is
the
intent
of
congress.
and
if
i
can
read
it.
it
does
appear
in
the
u.s.
code
and
congressional
administrative
reports
at
9522.
they
said
due
to
the
penal
nature
of
forfeiture
statutes,
it's
the
intent
of
these
provisions
that
the
property
will
be
forfeit
only
if
there's
a
substantial
connection
between
the
property
and
the
criminal
activity.
and
then
they
went
on
and,
more
pointedly
for
our
purposes
here,
said
finally,
it
should
be
pointed
out
that
no
property
would
be
forfeited
under
the
senate
amendment
to
the
extent
of
the
interest
of
any
innocent
owner
of
the
property.
and
then
they
said
the
term
"owner"
should
be
broadly
construed
and
interpreted
to
include
any
person
with
a
cognizable
or
legal
equitable
interest
in
the
property,
and
then,
as
if
to
add
a
final
sentence
that
addresses
our
issues
here,
said
specifically
the
property
would
not
be
subject
to
forfeiture
unless
the
owner
of
such
property
knew
or
consented
to
the
fact
that...
and
the
second
thing
is...
that
the
property
was
proceeds
traceable
to
an
illegal
exchange,
in
essence,
saying
the
person
has
to
know.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
it
makes
them
innocent,
your
honor.
the
question
is
are
they
covered,
isn't
it?
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
okay.
you
have
to
say
are
they
and
should
they
be
covered
by
that
innocent
owner
provision.
should
a
donee
be
covered?
and
if
i
may,
i
thought...
one
example
about
a
donation...
and
we
think
that
is
the
basis
this
case
should
be
decided
on,
that
is,
the
interpretation
of
this
statute
and
that
phrase.
and
we
submit
donees,
mere
donees,
although
i
don't
agree
she
is
one...
but
we
submit
that
mere
donees
do
fall
within
that
protection
and
that
congress
intended
them
to.
for
example--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
well,
your
honor,
i
mean,
it
is
a
complicated
relationship.
she
had
a
long-term
relationship
with
this
man.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
he
lived
with
her.
she
cooked
for
him.
she
cleaned
for
him.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
that's
true.
there...
i
mean,
the
remand
was
a
remand
back
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
so,
yes,
we...
the
statute
puts
the
burden
on
the
innocent
owner
to
demonstrate
their
innocence,
and
so
that
is
true.
but
in
terms
of
donees,
for
example,
if
brenna
had
taken
the
money,
the
$200,000,
that
was
used
to
buy
the...
buy
it
and
given
it
to
the
church
or
a
charity,
i
submit
it
wouldn't
serve
the
other
purpose
of
this
statute
which
the
government
cited
in
its
cert
petition
and
is
in
a
senate
report
one
iota.
the
other
purpose
of
this
statute
is
as...
and
they
quote
a
senate
report...
today
few
in
congress
or
the
law
enforcement
community
fail
to
recognize
that
the
traditional
criminal
sanctions
of
fine
and
imprisonment
are
inadequate
to
deter
and
punish
the
enormously
profitable
and
dangerous
trade
in
drugs.
to
forfeit
that
money
from
the
church
or
the
charity,
although
they
are
even
more
clearly
a
mere
donee,
would
not
further
deterrence,
would
not
further...
would
not
punish
a
drug
offender
one
iota
or
one
whit.
it
wouldn't
advance
the
only
other
real
purpose
of
this
statute
at
all.
if,
for
example...
it
becomes
even
clearer...
let's
say
brenna
had
bought--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--your
honor,
the
test
that
congress
chose
to
couple
with
what
was
a
very
broad
forfeiture
provision,
this
traceable
concept,
was
to
focus
on
innocence.
with
respect
to
a
brother
or
someone
else
who
perhaps
participated
with
the
individual
in
the
bad
acts,
probably
the
result
would
be
it
would
be
forfeited.
but
that
is...
would
be
determined
at
a
trial
on
the
question
that
is
often
at
a
trial.
is
he
innocent?
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
from
the...
what
i
referenced
was,
one,
the
senate
report
saying
it
was
deter
crime
and
then,
secondly,
from
the...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
the
statute
says...
it
uses
the
words
that
you
won't
forfeit
property
from
one...
from
an
owner
by
reason
of
an
act
committed...
that
the
owner...
established
by
the
owner
to
have
been
committed
without
his
knowledge,
meaning
without
his
knowledge,
and
that's
why
it's
called
innocent
owner.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
no.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
no,
i
don't
believe
he
would
be
under
those
circumstances.
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
right.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
when...
what
i
would
take
issue
with
is
applying
the
concept
of
when
it
was
committed
as
opposed
to
when
he
receives
the
proceeds.
and
so--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--i--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--i
think,
your
honor,
the
logical
test
would
be,
especially
when
you're
dealing
with
proceeds
because
proceeds...
this
house...
for
example,
at
the
time
the
illegal
act
was
committed
in
1981,
this
house
was
a
stranger
to
that
transaction.
no
one,
the
people
who
owned
it
or
the
people
who
are
not
of
record
here
who
sold
it
to
ms.
goodwin
sometime
thereafter,
the
people
who...
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
in
my
view,
no,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
think
the
logical
time
to
apply
it
is
the
time
of
the
gift,
the
time
of
the
receipt.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
but,
your
honor,
if
i
may,
in
terms
of
when
you're
talking
about
proceeds,
proceeds
like
something
like
this...
it
necessarily...
i
mean,
the
house
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
transaction
at
all
at
the
time
the
illegal
acts
were
committed.
it
wasn't
involved.
it
later
becomes
arguably
tainted
by
the
purchase
with
funds.
and
so
when
you
are
applying
that
concept,
which
is
the
full
scope
of
this
particular
statute...
it's
a
statute
designed
to
cover
items
exchanged
for
drugs
and
proceeds
traceable
thereto...
the
only
time
that
it
would
seem
logical
to
assess
the
knowledge
test
would
be
at
the
time
of
the
gift.
proceeds
necessarily,
as
they
transmute,
are
afterwards.
the
knowledge
would
have
to...
would
seem
to
be
tested
and
logically
tested
at
that
time,
not
at
the
earlier
time
when
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
it.
and
so,
that's
where
and
why
i
contend
that.
your
honor,
with
respect
to,
for
example,
this
particular
property,
if...
let
me...
the
reason
i
say
and
submit
to
this
court
that
there
is
no
difference
between
donees
and
bona
fide
purchasers...
and
the
united
states
seems
to
have
conceded
that
some
purchasers
qualify
as
innocent
owners
under
this
statute...
is
there's
no
distinction
in
the
statute
at
all
between
bona
fide
purchasers
and
innocent
owners.
the
test
that
congress
chose
to
enunciate
was
a
lack
of
knowledge
test,
not
a
test
of
bona
fide
purchase.
i
submit
they
chose
that
test
for
a
reason.
they
were
drafting
a
very
broad,
very
far-reaching
forfeiture
statute,
and
to
make
sure
there
were
not
unlawful
takings,
to
make
sure
there
were
not
unfair
takings,
they
drafted
a
test
that
focused
on
innocence.
and
that
is
what
the
joint
statement
seems
to
indicate.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
yes,
your
honor,
and
with
respect
to
proceeds,
then
that
would
often
make
sense.
in
terms
of...
as
i
had
understood
the
government's
argument
previously,
i
thought
they
were
saying
they
did
have
the
right
to
elect
to
go
after
even
bona
fide
purchasers
in
some
instance,
and
even
if
it
is
only
in
limited
instances,
it
creates
an
anomaly
and
a
problem
when
you
construe
the
criminal
statute
which
protects
bona
fide
purchasers
specifically.
congress
knew
how
to
protect
bona
fide
purchasers
alone
when
they
wanted
to,
and
they
said
so.
and
when
you
put
next
to
it
the
civil
statute...
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
because
the
civil
statute
is
a
statute
addressed
to
in
rem
actions.
it
is
a
statute
that
if
a
person
who
is
under
indictment
and
has
made
a
bona
fide
sale...
if
the
government
can
no
longer
reach
that
asset
under
the
criminal
statute,
under
the
civil
statute,
if
the
government
elects
to
do
so,
and
if
their
construction
of
the
innocent
owner
provision
stands,
and
if
they
do
have
the
right
to
go
after
those
things,
they
can
impact,
detract
from,
and
i
had
thought
completely
override
the
bona
fide
purchaser
provision
in
the
criminal
statute.
and
so,
the
only
way
to
make
sense
of
both
together
is
to
understand
that
the
civil
statute
has
been
drafted
to
be
much
more
far-reaching
and
the
protection
is
more
far-reaching.
with
respect
to--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--you--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--there
are
two
parts
to
that,
judge,
and...
justice.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
there
are
two
parts
to
that.
first,
the
question
about
the
brother.
normally
what
is
going
to
happen
with
the
brother
is
he's
going
to
know,
and
that's
not
a
real
problem.
but
with
respect
to
the
construction--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--because
we're
construing--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
legislature
when
they
drafted
it,
said
the
term
"owner"...
and
in
the
joint
statement...
what
i
would
point
to
is
the
joint
statement
of
congress
where
they
said
construe
"owner"
broadly,
give
it
meaning
to
include
any
person
with
any
cognizable,
legal,
or
equitable
interest
in
the
property
seized.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
your
honor,
can...
you
can
take
that
position.
i
don't
think
that's
what
congress
intended.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
it
may
be.
i'm
confident
the
government
would
attack
it
on
a
number
of
grounds
and
would
have
a
trial
on
the
issues.
is
it
a
sham?
did
he
retain
any
control?
is
there
any
way
he
gets
any
benefit
from
it?
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
your
honor,
i--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--if
you
assume
that
it
was
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
he
did,
indeed,
have
no
control
over
it,
it
was
totally
irrevocable--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--and
there
was
no
way
he
could
reach
it
or--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--influence
the
trustees
or
any
of
those
other
factual
questions,
then
i
would
have
to
concede
that
he
could
probably
do
that
under
this
statute.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
he
could
do
it.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
see,
where
i
take
issue
with--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--i
agree
that
if
all
those
things
are
conceded,
that
would
have
to
be
the
answer.
but
what
would
happen
practically
is
the
government
would
not
agree
with
that,
and
they
probably
would
have
a
great
plethora
of
facts
to
show
he
had
some
control.
he
was
getting
some
benefit.
it
was
something
that--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--that
may
be
the
very
answer
there,
your
honor,
in
that
if
he
is
escaping
another
obligation,
the
government
would
attempt
to
seize
the
value
that
he
was...
of
the
obligation
he
was
escaping,
as
i
think
we
heard
from
the
government.
they
would
say
he
has
an
obligation
to
support
his
children.
he
no
longer
has
to
do
that.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
that
may
be
an
obligation
too,
and
again,
it
is
something
that...
that's
what
trials
are
about,
and
that
is
what
one
would
decide
at
a
hearing--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
gotten
the
benefit.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
yes.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
example
asks
you
to
assume
that
it
is
absolute,
it's
irrevocable,
there's
no
benefits
to
him
as
to
the
excess
over
and
above
things,
i
concede
that
that
under
this
statute,
the
way
congress
drafted
it,
would
be
something
that
could
happen.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
i...
your
honor,
i
have
grave
doubts
that
the
government
would
accept
it
or
that
it
would
be
safe,
but
it
could
happen.
but
i
don't...
i
think
what
happened
when
congress
adopted
the
test
they
adopted
was
they
opted
for
a
very
far-reaching
test,
one
that
gives
them
the
right
to
attack
all
such
transactions
as
traceable
and
then
enunciated
a
test
which
was
innocence
of
knowledge
as
to
those
facts
that
one
would
have
a
trial
over
on
those
very
issues.
and
so,
to
the
extent
congress
chose
the
test
and
chose
the
parameters,
i
think
you...
yes,
it
could
happen,
but
by
the
same
token,
i
think
the
government
would
contest
it,
and
if
they
had
any
facts
that
suggested
it
was
anything
otherwise,
they
would
prevail.
and
so,
while
it
is
a
possibility,
i
don't
think
it
is
of
such
consequence
that
it
warrants
overriding
what
does
appear
in
the
joint
statement
a
fairly
clear
expression
of
intent
to
protect
innocent
recipients
which
can
include
very,
very
admirable
recipients.
you
could
have
an
example
where
if
brenna
had,
for
example,
purchased
this
house
and
had
given
it
to
the
united
way
and
they
used
it
to
help
rehabilitate
drug
addicts,
the
forfeiture
of
that
property
would
do...
would
undercut
the
other
purpose
of
this
program.
they
are
certainly
innocent,
and
if
you
read
the
statute--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
you
could.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
that's
true.
it
would...
in
normal...
if
she
was
married
in
new
jersey,
it
would
have
been
jointly
held
if
it
had
been
held
in
both
their
names,
for
example.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
i
believe
7
does,
your
honor.
i
don't
have
the
statute--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--yes,
and
4...
section...
and
4...
there's
another
section
as
well
that
deals
with
conveyances,
for
example,
specifically,
and
they
too
have
separate
protections
for
innocent
owners.
but
to
the
extent
this
statute
is
and
does
create
the
proceeds
concept,
which
is
where
the
majority
of
the
cases
under
this
section
are
litigated,
the
conveyances
and
the
other
sections
cover
other
aspects
of
it.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
that's
one
of
the
other
sections,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
your
honor,
i
would...
as
i
had
understood
the
government's
brief,
they
were
taking
the
position...
if
you
look
at
footnote
8,
they
had
suggested
in
footnote
8
that
the
innocent
owner
provision
had
meaning
only
for
people
who
took
before
the
illegal
transaction
not
for
anybody
after.
and
so,
if
one
reads
8,
the
government's
brief
suggested
that
they
were,
in
fact,
reserving
the
right
to
attack
bona
fide
purchasers
for
value.
if
that
was
or
if
they
are
even
reserving
the
right
to
opt
for
that,
then
there
is
no
meaning
to
the
innocent
owner
clause.
i
mean,
it
becomes
meaningless.
the
example
in
8
where
they
posit,
well,
it's...
and
it
starts
midway
down
through
footnote
8
where
they
posit
it
is
possible
for
funds
to
be
entrusted
to
a
person
and
that
person
subsequently
uses
them
to
engage
in
a
drug
transaction
without
the
owner's
knowledge.
the
sum
of
money
might
be
turned
over
to
a
friend
for
investment.
so,
a
turns
it
over
to
b,
a
banker
or
a
broker.
the
banker
or
the
broker
uses
it
instead
for
drugs,
and
then
the
government
later
seizes
proceeds.
the
government
posited
in
that
case
that
that
gave
meaning
to
innocent
owner
because
the
ownership
was
before
the
illegal
acts,
and
from
that
at
least
we
drew
that
they
were
attacking
all
bona
fide
purchasers
or
at
least
reserving
the
right
to.
if
they
are
doing
that,
that
particular
section
provides...
when
you
read
it,
you
never
find
an
example
like
that
in
any
case
cited
to
this
court.
and
we
suggested
that
in
our
brief
and
challenged
the
government
to
provide
one,
and
they
did
not.
but
if
you
think
about
that,
the
example
they
proffer,
it
has
no
meaning
either.
if
a
gives
the
money
to
b,
b
uses
it,
and
the
government
seizes
it,
a
going
to
the
government
and
saying,
well,
b
owes
me
money
that
i
entrusted
him
to
and
you
happened
to
have
seized
proceeds
from
this
fellow,
turn
them
over
to
me,
a
private
citizen
has
no
right
of
tracing.
he
has
a
debt
owed
from
b,
but
he
can't
go
claim
that
against
the
government,
and
i
would
submit
that's
why
there
are
no
cases.
it
is...
if
not
meaningless,
it's
virtually
meaningless.
and
i
would
ask
this
court
not
to
give
that
construction
to
this
clause.
congress
chose
the
words
when
they
know...
when
they
wanted
to
express
bona
fide
purchaser,
they
said
so,
and
they
said
it
in
the
criminal
statute.
in
this
particular
statute,
they
made
a
very
broad
statute,
a
statute
that
is
far
broader
than
the
criminal
statute.
and
they
said
innocent
owners
are
protected.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
i'm
not
sure
i
understand,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
what
they
were
saying
was
that
later
on
innocent
owners
could
not
take
because
if
they're
taking
after
the
date
of
the
criminal
act,
they
take
nothing.
and
so,
if
this
example
doesn't
have
meaning,
innocent
owner
has
no
meaning.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
right.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
right.
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
what
i'm
saying
is
she
can't
enforce
against
the
government--
mr.
james
a.
plaisted
--a
third
party,
her
debt
from
b,
and
i
agree.
and
so
all
i
was
saying
was
that
this
example
breathes
no
meaning
into
innocent
owner
at
all
because
it
is
meaningless.
thank
you
very
much.
