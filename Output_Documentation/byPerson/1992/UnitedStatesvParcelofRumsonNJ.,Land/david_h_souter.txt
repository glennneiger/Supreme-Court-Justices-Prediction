justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
make
a
suggestion?
justice
david
h.
souter
aren't
you
implicitly
saying
that
at
least...
excuse
me...
at
least
one
set
of
identifiable
proceeds
has
got
to
survive?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
said
in
the
case
of
the
bfp
example
of
the
sale
of
the
house
that
you
recognize
the
transaction
as,
in
effect,
converting
the
house
back
into
money.
the
proceeds
become
the
money
again
in
the
hands
of
the
drug
dealer
who
sells
it
because
you've
got
one
set
of
proceeds
there.
but
when
you
get
into
a
bona
fide
purveyor
of
services,
you
can't
take
the
services.
and
you,
in
effect,
are
saying
there's
got
to
be
something
that
we
can
get
our
hands
on,
and
therefore,
when
the
doctor
performs
the
surgery,
you
can't
take
the
surgery
and
sell
it
on
the
market.
so,
therefore,
you
still
go
after
the
money.
but
if
the
doctor,
in
fact,
had
been
the
purchaser
of
the
house,
you
would
say,
okay,
the
doctor
gets
the
house
free
and
clear
and
the
proceeds
become
the
money
that
he
paid
for
the
house
again
in
the
hands
of
the
drug
dealer.
but
your
overriding
interpretive
criterion
seems
to
be
there's
got
to
be
something
left
that
we
can
get
our
hands
on.
if
there
is,
we
will
not
claim
multiple...
a
multiplicity
of
proceeds.
if
there
isn't,
we'll
claim
a
physical
proceeds
no
matter
what
the
bona
fides
of
the
transaction
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
really
want
to
say
that,
though?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
in
the
doctor
position,
you
don't
get
something
back.
the
government
can't
take
the
appendix
scar.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
has
got
no
obligation--
justice
david
h.
souter
--he
has
got
no
obligation
to
make
either
his
pal
or
his
children
millionaires,
and
that's
still
the
consequence
of
the
chief's
example,
isn't
it?
