david
h.
souter
you're
willing
to--
--i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
you're
willing
to
accept
the
sanction
of
reversal
if
there
had
been
an
objection.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
phillips,
are
we
going
to
sustain
that
or
not
depending
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
plain...
but
you
accept
as
a
general
rule
that
all
plain
error
questions
are
reviewable
simply
on
an
abuse
standard?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
the
point
of
may
that
gets--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
can't
prove
it,
but
there
are
still
degrees
of
plausibility.
and
don't
you
have
to
confront
the
fact
that
the
degree
of
plausibility
is
much
lower
in
this
case
than
it
would
be,
let's
say
if
a
bailiff
had
spent
3
days
in
the
courtroom
with
them
or
a
witness
had
spent
3
days
in
the
courtroom
with
them,
and
so
on?
aren't
we
entitled
and
required
to
take
this
varying
degree
of
plausibility
of
prejudice
into
account?
