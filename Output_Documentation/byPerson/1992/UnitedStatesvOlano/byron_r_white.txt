plain

went
far
beyond
just,
say,
substantial
effect.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
plain
error
or.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
the
rule
said
that,
after
all,
this
case
is
about
whether
an
error
may
be
noticed
without
an
objection.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
thought
the
rule
was
plain
that
either
plain
error
or
an
error
that
affects
substantial
rights
can
be
noticed
without,
despite
the
absence
of
an
objection.
isn't
that
what
the
rule
says?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
what
the
rule
says?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
just
read
it.
just
read
the
rule,
the
plain
error
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
are
some,
at
least
on
occasion
there
are
some
defects
or
errors
that
may
be
noticed
even
though
they,
all
they
do
is
affect
substantial
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore
are
not
harmless.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
any
defect
that
affects
substantial
rights
also
has
to
be
a
miscarriage
of
justice
under
this
part
of
the
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
such
as
those
that
affect
substantial
rights
like
the
rule
says?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
it
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
noticeable
even
though
there
was
no
objection.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
think
that
affecting
substantial
rights
should
have
the
same
meaning
in
the
two
parts
of
the
rule,
that
it,
an
error
is
harmless
unless
it
affects
fundamental
rights
or
is
a
miscarriage
of
justice?
is
that
what
it
means?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
the
same
words.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
that
time
it
was
an
objection.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
eventually
counsel
subsided.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
understood
him
to
argue
that
even
if
this
was
a
substantial
error
under
152(b)
it
wasn't,
it
was
error
to
notice
it--
justice
byron
r.
white
--unless
it
also
was
a
much
more
serious
error
than
just
affecting
substantial
rights.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he's--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
understand
that
he,
he
said
that
it
was
error
to
notice
it
even
though
it
might
affect
substantial
rights.
that
isn't
enough
to
even
allow
noticing.
i
thought
that
was
his
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
certainly
disagree
with
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
notice
our
error
every
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
a
judgment
like
this
really
is
a
recurring
problem
for
the
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
if
it
really,
if
judgments
like
this
really
bother
you,
i
suppose
the
justice
department
has
a
representative
on
the
rules
committees.
and
if
it's
just
a
rule
problem
you
could
at
least
propose
that
it
would
be
changed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
could
say
a
little
more
clearly
than
rule
151
does
what
happens.
i
mean
52.
