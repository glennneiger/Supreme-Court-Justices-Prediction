justice
john
paul
stevens
general
starr,
can
i
just
interrupt
you?
i
was
startled
when
you
said
this
was
a
fairly
normal
practice.
i
had
a
fair
amount
of
trial
work
when
i
was
in
practice
and
it
startled
me
that
a
judge
did
it,
because
they
always
excused
the
alternates
in
my
limited
experience.
can
you,
do
you
have
some
support
for
your
saying
that
it's
done
rather
broadly?
justice
john
paul
stevens
talking
about
the
federal
system
only.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then,
but
you
have
conceded
that
it's
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
the
practice
is
improper
and
should
be
stopped.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
problem
is
very
easily
solved.
they
could
equally
have
stipulated
if
some
juror
gets
sick
or
something
we
will
have
an
11-person
verdict.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
really,
if
you
had
a
clear
rule
we
shouldn't
have
this
problem
in
the
future.
and
therefore
nothing
is
at
stake
but
this
particular
trial,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
the
message,
the
educating
message
you
want
to
convey
is
that
although
it
violates
the
rule
and
it's
plain
in
that
sense,
there's
no
sanction
if
you
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
other
sanction
would
there
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
would
always
require
an
inquiry
into
what
happened
in
the
deliberations
of
the
jury,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
we
just
generally
don't
like.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
what
the
rule
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
what
the
rule
says.
it
says
defects
affecting
substantial
rights.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
affecting
substantial
rights
modifies
the
word
error?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
this
violation
affects
substantial
rights?
do
you
think
having
a
couple
of
extra
people
in
the
jury
room
affects
substantial
rights?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes
or
no?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
you
found
out
the
marshall
was
sitting
in
there
for
20
minutes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if...
oh,
that
makes
a
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many
times
are
you
aware
of
this
practice
being
followed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
telling
us
it's
a
common
practice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
know
how
often?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
know
how
often?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
relying
on
a
phrase
in
a
footnote,
if
i
remember
correctly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
relying
on
a
phrase
in
a
footnote
in
frady.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
your
principal
authority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
your
principal
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
said
frady,
the
footnote
in
frady.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
starr,
do
you
have
injustice
cases
other
than
frady
and
young?
the
interesting
thing
is
the
frady
court
said
in
the
footnote,
if
the
errors
are
obvious
or
if
they
otherwise
seriously
affect
the
fairness,
integrity,
or
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings.
but
they
first
said,
if
they
are
obvious
was
the
first
category
and
this
was
the
second.
but
you
think
the
obviousness
was
just
sort
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it's
not
and.
obvious
or.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it's
clear
there
is
no
per
se
approach
because
the
word
may
is
in
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
one
of
the
things
you
weigh
when
you
evaluate
the
significance
of
an
error
that
affects
substantial
rights.
justice
john
paul
stevens
shock
the
conscience
is
now
the
test
of
plain
error,
the
test
for
due
process
violations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
did
affect
substantial
rights.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
it
goes
to
all
this
confusion
at
the
end
of
a
long
trial
that
we
heard
so
much
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
it
goes
to
all
this
confusion
at
the
end
of
a
long
trial
when
everybody
is
harassed
and
trying
to
get
finished
up
that
we
heard
so
much
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
errors
can
be
forgiven
under
that
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
really
not
what
they
said.
they
said
they
thought
this
error,
this
kind
of
error
was
inherently
prejudicial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
one
reason
was
that
you
can't
always
tell
what
happens
case-by-case,
so
they
adopt
really
a
per
se
rule
for
this
kind
of
error.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is,
one
could
argue
that's
an
exercise
of
discretion
for
a
class
of
errors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
starr,
can
i
interrupt
just
for
one
question?
would
you
agree
that
the
standard
for
review
of
plain
error
on
direct
appeal
is
less
strict
than
the
standard
for
collateral
review
under
2255?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
has
to
be
at
least
less
than
whatever
that
standard
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
why
i
used
the
word
miscarriage
of
justice.
that's
the
standard
under
2255.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
what's
the
difference?
