well,
general
starr,
if
it
appeared
afterwards
that
the
alternate
juror
had
violated
the
instruction
and
had
actively
participated
in
the
jury
deliberations,
would
your
answer
possibly
change?
could
it
rise
to
the
level
of
a
fundamental
unfairness?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
starr,
does
it
make
any
difference
if
one
of
the
defendants
was
absent
from
the
courtroom
when
this
occurred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
starr,
i
guess
you're
urging
us
to
find
that
this
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
a
plain
error
recognizable
under
rule
52?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
it
did,
you
would
say
subject
it
to
a
harmless
error
analysis?
justice

the
first
is
united
states
versus
olano.
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondents
were
tried
on
criminal
charges
in
the
district
court.
fourteen
jurors
were
selected
to
hear
the
case.
two
alternate
jurors
were
identified
before
the
jury
deliberations
begun.
without
objection
from
the
respondents,
the
district
court
judge
allowed
the
alternate
jurors
to
attend
the
jury
deliberations
but
specifically
instructed
them
not
to
participate.
the
respondents
were
convicted.
they
argued
on
appeal
at
the
presence
of
the
alternate
jurors
during
the
jury
deliberations
violated
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
24(c).
because
the
respondents
had
not
raised
this
claim
on
the
district
court,
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
plain
errors
standard
of
rule
53(b).
the
court
found
that
the
violation
of
rule
24(c)
was
indeed
the
plain
error;
it
vacated
the
respondent's
convictions.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
clarify
the
standard
for
plain
error
review.
rule
52(b)
provides
the
court
of
appeals
a
limited
authority
to
correct
forfeited
errors
such
as
this:
first,
there
must
indeed
be
an
error,
the
defendant
must
not
have
waived
his
rights;
second,
the
error
must
be
plain
which
means
clear
or
obvious;
third,
the
error
must
affect
substantial
rights.
normally,
this
means
the
error
was
prejudicial
and
normally
the
defendant
must
make
a
specific
showing
of
prejudice.
in
addition,
the
authority
granted
by
rule
52(b)
is
discretionary
not
mandatory.
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
exercise
that
discretion
unless
the
error
seriously
affects
the
fairness,
integrity,
or
the
public
reputation
of
the
judicial
proceedings.
in
the
case
before
us,
the
government
concedes
that
the
deviation
from
rule
24(c)
in
letting
the
alternate
set
in
the
jury
room
was
an
error
and
that
that
error
was
plain.
however,
we
find
the
error
did
not
affect
substantial
rights.
the
presence
of
the
alternate
jurors
during
deliberations,
like
other
intrusions
in
the
jury
room,
must
be
analyzed
for
prejudicial
impact.
the
respondents
have
made
no
specific
showing
of
prejudice
and
we
will
not
presume
prejudice
here
because
the
district
court
specifically
instructed
the
alternate
jurors
not
to
participate.
thus,
the
court
of
appeals
lack
the
authority
to
correct
the
error.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
accordingly
is
reversed
in
the
case
is
remanded.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
joined
by
justices
white
and
blackmun.
