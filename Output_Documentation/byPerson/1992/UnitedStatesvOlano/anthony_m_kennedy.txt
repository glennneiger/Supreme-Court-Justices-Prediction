justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
say
these
alternate
jurors
were
sworn?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
they
sworn
just
before
they
retire?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
are
sworn
at
the
outset
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that.
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
that
during
the
deliberations
one
of
the
regular
jurors
said
now,
i
forgot,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
testimony
on
this
subject,
and
one
of
the
alternates
says
oh,
yes,
there
was.
john
smith
testified
to
that
very
point.
and
the
other
jurors
said
oh,
you're
right.
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
prejudicial?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--did
the
court
of
appeals
here
say
that
it
was
exercising
discretion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
the
court
of
appeals
here
say
that
it
was
exercising
discretion
or
does
this
opinion
indicate
that
dismissal
is
mandatory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
it
was
exercising
a
discretion
in
this
particular
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
would
be
rather
difficult
for
us
to
sustain
a
judgment
on
the
basis
of
a
discretion
that
wasn't
exercised.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
we
have
no
choice
in
this
matter
but
to
reverse
the
conviction.
then
would
we
have
to
send
it
back?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
know
if
there
are
cases
in
the
court
of
appeals
where
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
they
have
discretion
under
this
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
just
ask,
general
starr,
i
am
assuming
that
the
colloquy
between
defense
counsel
and
the
court
were
outside
the
presence
of
the
jury?
