mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
refocusing
the
attention
away
from
where
general
starr's
analysis
initiates,
which
is
to
try
to
take
the
case
away
from
the
specific
language
of
rule
52
and
deal
with
the
question
in
terms
of
labels,
whether
this
is
a
miscarriage
of
justice
or
not.
i
think
it
is
more
appropriate
to
analyze
each
of
the
words
in
rule
52,
and
if
you
do
that
what
you
conclude
at
the
end
of
the
process
is
that
this
is
an
error
that
warrants
reversal
in
this
case.
general
starr
and
i
are
in
complete
agreement
at
least
on
one
point.
the
district
court
unquestionably
erred
in
both
proposing
and
in
allowing
the
alternates
to
attend
the
jury's
deliberations
in
this
case.
well,
24(c)
could
not
be
stated
more
plainly.
an
alternate
juror
who
does
not
replace
a
regular
juror
shall
be
discharged
after
the
jury
retires
to
consider
its
verdict.
i
do
not
know
what
judge
starr
believes
would
be
added
to
the
mix
by
this
court
to
announce
that
that
unequivocal
rule
means
precisely
what
it
says
in
terms
of
somehow
enforcing
this
particular
mandate,
because
i
don't
know
how
this
mandate
could
be
stated
any
more
plainly
than
it
is
in
that
rule.
the
question
then
is
does
the
error
in
this
case
justify
reversal.
and
in
order
to
determine
that
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
plain
error
rule
requires.
it's
interesting,
because
the
plain
error
rule
requires
the
same
thing--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--as
to
mr.
olano,
counsel
did
not
object.
with
respect
to
mr.
gray
counsel
did
interpose
an
objection
at
one
point.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
could
read
that
a
couple
of
different
ways,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
you
know
it's
interesting,
the
government
in
the
first
two
submissions
to
this
court
read
it
the
same
way
we
read
it,
which
was
as
an
objection.
if
you
read
the
cert
petition
of
the
government
and
its
opening
brief,
in
both
instances
they
describe
that
as
an
objection
to
the
proposal
of
the
district
court.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
at
that
time
it
was
an
objection,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
eventually
counsel
subsided.
and
i
think
that
the
importance
of
that
goes
more
into
the
mix
of
the
discretion
as
to
whether
or
not
to
notice
this
error,
and
i'd
like
to
address
that
at
that
point
if
that's
permissible,
justice
white.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
may
well
go
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
under
that
standard,
that
is
true.
all
errors
i
think
could
have
been
forgiven.
it
seems
clear
to
me
under
the
language
of
the
rules
that
the
harmless
error
and
the
plain
error
requirements
are
the
same.
the
question
is
did
the
error
affect
substantial
rights.
i
almost
heard
general
starr
tell
us
today
that
this
was
a
substantial
right,
but
then
i
think
he
sort
of
backed
off
of
that.
i
think
it's
unquestionably
clear
that
this
is
a
substantial
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
he
did
claim
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct,
your
honor.
he
challenged
that.
but
the
question
then
is
what's
the
appropriate
legal
analysis
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
appropriate
to
notice
the
error.
and
there
i
think
it's
clear
the
court
of
appeals
here
exercised
its
discretion
to
notice
this
error.
the
question
is
may
it
notice
the
error.
that's
the
standard.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
court
of
appeals
exercised
its
discretion
and
noticed
this
one.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
just
wanted--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
certainly
disagree
with
him,
but
i
do
want
to
kind
of
take
these
in
sort
of
seriatim
stages
to
determine
in
the
first
instance
do
we
have
a
substantial
right.
if
we
agree
upon
that,
then
we
can
evaluate
whether
it
made
sense
to
notice
the
particular
error
in
this
particular
case,
justice
white.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
have
noticed
that
over
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no
comment.
[laughter]
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
the
error
here
is
substantial,
it
seems
to
me
you
need
go
and
look
no
further
than
to
the
advisory
committee
notes
which
specifically
analyzed
what
the
district
judge
did
here
in
allowing
the
jurors
to
go,
or
excuse
me,
the
alternates
to
go
back
into
the
jury
room
and
expressly
condemned
that
practice.
why?
because
it
intrudes
into
the
sanctity
of
the
deliberations
of
the
jury.
and
that's
an
important
value,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
as
an
important
value
in
a
whole
host
of
cases
with
very
expansive
language.
it
requires
a
very
significant
interest
of
the
state
to
justify
intruding
into
the
jury's
deliberations.
and
therefore
i
think
it
very
difficult
to
say
that
this
is
an
insubstantial
error,
and
i
think
particularly
since
congress
approved
this
rule
against
the
backdrop
of
an
advisory
committee
note
that
regarded
this
as
a
very
significant
matter
and
specifically
rejected
this
particular
approach.
it
seems
to
me
quite
clear
that
it
has
to
be
regarded
as
a
substantial
error.
so
then
the
question
is
should
the
error
have
been
noticed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
it
seems
to
me
in
this
context
there
are
good
reasons
for
why
the
court
of
appeals
noticed
the
particular
error
here
and
no
good
reasons
on
the
other
side
of
the
equation
with
respect
to
the
government's
position
as
to
why
you
should
ignore
this
particular
problem.
first,
it's
important
to
recognize
there
is
no
governmental
interest
served
by
this
procedure.
no
value
is
served
by
it.
the
problem
of
a
mistrial
which
might
otherwise
exist
is
taken
care
of
completely
by
rule
23.
the
desire
to
appease
or
to
please
the
alternate
jurors
was
a
consideration
both
in
1942
and
1983,
and
was
rejected
both
times
by
the
advisory
committee,
and
that
rejection
was
approved
by
congress.
thus
there
is
no
countervailing
government
interest
that
justifies
what
the
district
judge
did
here.
second,
what
the
district
judge
has
done
here
is
to
invade
a
structural
element
of
the
trial.
this
is
not
mere
trial
error.
this
is
the
jury
we're
talking
about
and
how
it
deliberates.
this
is
taking
an
outside
force
that
has
no
reason
to
be
there
and
allowing
it
to
alter
the
mix
within
the
jury's
deliberations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
wouldn't
necessarily
say
that
it
was
reversible
per
se.
what
i
would
say
is
that
you
have
to
examine
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case
in
order
to
determine
whether
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
it
may
have
made
some
kind
of
a
difference.
i
mean,
one
of
the
considerations
in
this
case
is
that
this
is
a
jury
that
didn't
get
it
right.
we
have
15
counts
in
which
my
clients
were
found
guilty.
five
of
those
counts
were
dismissed
by
the
court
of
appeals
because
there
wasn't
a
shred
of
evidence
in
support
of
those
verdicts.
in
a
situation
like
that
i
would
be
far
more
inclined
to
find
error
than
i
might
be
in
a
situation
where
i
was
absolutely
convinced
that
the
jury
had
performed
its
job
absolutely
perfectly.
and
so
i
don't
think
you
can
have
a
per
se
rule,
and
we
don't
urge
a
per
se
rule
here.
what
we
say
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
and
its
decision
to
notice
this
particular
error,
that
wasn't
an
abuse
of
discretion.
one
of
the
points
that
justice
stevens
made
earlier
about
how
commonplace
is
this
practice,
i
honestly
don't
know
how
commonplace
this
practice
is.
i've
never
seen
it
before
this
particular
case,
but
the
judge
does
say
that
she
knows
judges
who
have
undertaken
this
practice.
i
think
it's
important
to
make
two
observations
about
that.
first,
the
aba's
standards
on
criminal
justice
categorically
state
that
no
jurisdiction
follows
this
procedure.
it
is
condemned
in
all
jurisdictions
as
a
matter
of
the
law.
nobody
has
said
this
is
the
appropriate
way
to
proceed
with
regard
to
jury
deliberations.
but
the
second
point
about
it
my
assumption
is
that
the
judge
in
this
case
was
probably
considering
what
other
judges
in
the
ninth
circuit
do,
and
if
that's
the
case
then
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
legitimate
for
the
ninth
circuit
to
have
adopted
a
rule
that
said
this
is
enough.
we
don't
want
this
procedure.
it
has
no
legitimate
justification,
it
creates
a
great
potential
for
harm,
and
therefore
we
want
it
stopped.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
know
how
you
could
say
it
any
more
plainly
than
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
say
it.
they
say
dismiss
the
alternate,
discharge
the
alternate.
there
is
no
ambiguity
in
those
rules.
and
if
the
district
courts
have
undertaken
this
practice
in
the
face
of
a
very
specific
and
clear
rule,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
adding
the
weight
of
a
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
requires
you
to
go
looking
into
the
digest
is
not
going
to
advance
that
cause.
if
you
want
to
send
a
message
to
the
district
courts
you
have
to
send
it
in
one
way,
and
that's
by
requiring
a
reversal
in
a
particular
instance.
and
i
think
the
district,
excuse
me,
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
chose
this
vehicle
in
which
to
reverse
because
these
convictions
look
seriously
flawed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
would
urge
this
court
to
follow
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
i
see
no
reason
why
this
court
would
reweigh
and
reevaluate
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
exercise
its
discretion
to
notice
the
particular
error
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
the...
yes.
i
think
that
would
be
an
appropriate...
well,
no,
not
all
plain
errors.
it
depends
if
you're
talking
about
a
plain
error
that
affects
substantial
rights.
that
you
have
to
have
satisfied.
then
it
seems
to
me
you
move
to
the
next
stage
of
whether
you
may
notice
those--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
was
analyzing
the
full
range
of
considerations,
including
the
weight
attached
to
the
advisory
committee's
condemnation
of
this
particular
practice
and
the
fact,
against
the
background
of
course
of--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
believe
the
ninth
circuit
says
specifically
that
it
was
exercising
discretion
in
this
particular
case,
although
again
i
think
it's
inherent
in
any
analysis
of
the
plain
error
rule
which
says
that
you
may
notice.
obviously
you
have
to,
it's
not
enough
simply
to
have
a
substantial
right
and
it's
not
enough
simply
to
have
plain
error,
and
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
that
those
were
enough.
what
it
said
was--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
justice
kennedy,
this
is
not
a
case
where
you
are
reviewing
a
judgment
or
a
decision
by
an
administrative
agency
where
you
would
focus
specifically
on
the
record
before
the
agency
and
the
grounds
asserted
by
it.
routinely
appellate
courts
review
district
court
decisions
and
lower,
other
lower
courts
decisions
involving
exercises
of
discretion,
and
do
so
on
appeal.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
then
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
appropriate
to
remand
it
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
exercise
of
discretion.
but
the
court
of
appeals
clearly
did
not
say
that,
and
the
way
i
would
read
the
court
of
appeals'
analysis
in
light
of
the
may
notice
language
of
rule
24
is
that
it
obviously
was
exercising
its
discretion
to
send
a
message.
i
mean,
it
has
to
be
an
exercise
of
some
discretion
otherwise
you
don't,
the
notion
of
whether
you
will
notice
it
doesn't
come
into
play.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
under
rule
52?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
know
of
any
frankly
right
off
the
top
of
my
head
in
terms
of
rule
52
itself,
but
again
it
seems
to
me
it's
plain
from
the
precise
language
of
the
rule
that
they
have
to,
they
have
to
exercise
some
discretion.
it's
not
a
per
se
rule.
the
government
was
quite
right
in
condemning
the
notion
of
a
per
se
reversible
rule,
just
as
this
court
was
in
young
in
condemning
the
notion
of
per
se
analyses
as
appropriate
under
the
rule
52(b).
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
off
the
top
of
my
head...
i
mean,
i'm
assuming
that
it
must
have.
yes,
your
honor,
it
had
to
have
analyzed
rule
52
because
the
whole
question
was
whether
there
was
plain
error
here
because
it
hadn't
been
objected
to.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
may
well
be
the
precise,
i
mean
that
may
be
a
distillation
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
but
again--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there
is
at
least
language
in
the
court
of
appeals'
analysis
that
says
that
it's
undertaking
to
analyze
this
in
terms,
i
gather,
of
rule
52.
so
they
recognize
that
it
was
a
plain
error
in
this
case
and
that
it
had
to
consider
that
or
take
that
into
account.
you
know,
that's,
i
mean
that's
the
problem
with
the
analysis.
but
again,
i
don't
think
that
it's
appropriate
for
the
court
to
parse
out
the
precise
language
that
the
ninth
circuit
employs
if
it
is
quite
plain
that
under
a
reasonable
evaluation
of
all
the
conditions
of
rule
24,
or
excuse
me,
of
rule
52(b)
they
are
satisfied,
and
this
error
ought
to
be
noticed
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
is
no
question
that
there
would
have
to
be
an
independent
analysis
of
the
considerations
that
go
into
it,
which
is
what
i
was
trying
to
do
here,
is
to
say
what
supports
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
notice
this
error
and
then
what
would
weigh
on
the
other
side,
and
is
there
such
an
abuse
in
this
context
that
it
would
justify
saying
the
court
of
appeals
could
not
have
noticed
this
error
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
that's
the
same
question
justice
kennedy
asked,
and
i
hope
i'll
be
consistent,
but
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
if
they
say
we're
not
exercising
discretion
because
we
believe
we
don't
have
any,
then
it
would
be
appropriate
for
this
court
to
remand
for
the
court
to
exercise
its
discretion.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
for
this
kind,
but
i
think
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
i
think
that
is
an
exercise
of
discretion
for
the
kind
of
structural
errors
that
i
was
trying
to
identify
a
minute
ago,
that
there
are
two
different
kinds
of
errors
that
this
court
has
recognized,
some
of
which
it
is
unwilling
to
notice,
those
are
trial
errors
where
it
can
evaluate
the
affect
of
the
error
on
the
outcome
of
the
case,
and
others
are
structural
errors
where
the
court
has
been
much
more
reluctant
to
simply
shunt
those
aside
and
say
that
they
don't
count.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
not
irrelevant.
i
think
it--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--oh,
sure,
on
that
theory.
but
the
point
is...
and
that's
one
theory
for
why
you
ought
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals,
the
one
i
just
identified
about
the
structural
nature
of
the
error.
but
you
can
independently
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
because
there
are
lots
of
good
reasons.
i
mean,
this
was
a
flawed
conviction
and
therefore
there
is
a
very
real
serious,
a
very
real
risk
that
prejudice
arose
in
this
context
as
a
consequence
of
the
violation
that
was
found
in
this
case.
just,
you
know,
in
addition
to
that
you
could
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
tried
to
stop
this
practice
throughout
the
ninth
circuit.
in
addition
to
that
it
seems
to
me
you
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
say
that
we
think
that
any
deliberate,
even
if
in
some
sense
inadvertent
but
nevertheless
clear
disregard
of
a
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure,
which
the
judge
entertained
in
this
case,
does
cast
out
on
the
public
confidence
and
reputation
of
the
court
in
a
way
that
this
court
has
recognized
is
appropriate
in
order
to
find
that
there
has
been
plain
error.
i
think
my
basic
point
here
is
that
there
are
substantial
grounds
that
fully
support
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
to
notice
the
error
here,
and
either
on
an
independent
assessment
of
that
issue
or
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
this
error
should
have
been
noticed.
let
me
just
take
a
few
minutes
to
discuss
what
does
the
government
offer
on
the
other
side
of
the
may
notice
equation.
one,
it
claims
that
this
was
a
3-month
trial
and
begrudges
the
fact
that
it
would
be
required
to
retry
these
particular
defendants.
that's
grossly
overstated.
remember,
these
were
seven
criminal
defendants
initially.
five
of
them
have
been
completely
exonerated.
of
the
15
counts
for
the
last
two,
fully
one-third
of
those
counts
have
all
been
set
aside
for
having
no
evidence.
the
3-month
trial
in
this
case
obviously
is
not
attributable
just
to
the
claims
that
are
now
before
this
court.
the
retrial
in
this
case
would
be
significantly
shorter,
i
submit,
than
the
original
one,
assuming
the
government
decides
to
pursue
the
prosecution.
and
it
cannot
be
that
simply
the
cost
of
having
to
reprosecute
is
alone
a
ground
to
say
that
a
court
of
appeals
should
not
notice
a
plain
error
affecting
substantial
rights,
otherwise
rule
52(b)
is
rendered
a
nullity.
the
second
argument
the
government
put
forward
is
its
invited
error
argument,
that
somehow
the
defendants
here
created
this
problem.
the
record
is
absolutely
clear.
this
was
the
judge's
idea.
she
asked
for
the
defendants
to
go
ahead
and
agree
to
this,
and
they
did.
whatever
else
this
may
be,
this
was
not
invited
error
by
the
trial
lawyers
on
the
defense
side
in
this
case.
and
finally,
the
government
says
we
can't
prove
the
prejudice.
and
i'll
have
to
concede,
i
can
never
prove
that
the
invasion
of
the
deliberative
process
by
the,
in
this
case
was
prejudicial
to
my
client.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
justice
souter,
i
think
you
can
take
that
into
account.
i
think,
however,
it
probably
weighs
differently
than
the
way
that
you
characterize
it
because
one
of
the
things
that
we
know
is
that
at
least
one
of
these
jurors,
one
of
the
alternates
was
absolutely
the
last
person
that
these
defendants
wanted
in
that
jury
room.
that
was
the
person
they
selected,
based
on
the
non-verbal
behavior
of
that
juror
during
the
trial,
that
they
wanted
to
be
designated
as
an
alternate
and
therefore
not
participating
in
any
way
in
the
deliberations.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
i
would
certainly
temper
my
assessment
of
the
overall
likelihood
of
an
affect
against
the
backdrop
of
knowing
that
in
this
case
this
was
the
one
person
we
would
most
have
preferred
not
to
be
in
the
case
at
all.
and
therefore
i
think
the
potential
for
prejudice
is
there.
it
is
always
there.
it
has
been
recognized
generically.
i
think
it
also
exists
with
respect
to
this
specific
case.
i
guess
i
would
end
my
analysis
of
this
issue
and
of
the
appeal
by
going
back
to
brasfield
v.
united
states,
which
i
think
actually
provides
an
exceptionally
good
model
for
exactly
what
happened
here.
you
will
recall
in
brasfield
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
judge
should
poll
the
jurors
as
to
their
division
when
they
were
deadlocked,
and
this
court
condemned
that
practice
in
language
that
i
think
applied,
and
condemned
it
categorically
and
on
a
plain
error
basis,
it
had
not
been
objected
to.
and
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
brasfield--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
your
honor,
rule
52
wasn't
in
effect.
what
the
court
analyzed
it
and
concluded,
and
i
think
rule
52...
i
mean
i
think
brasfield
is
the
evidence
of
plain
error
being
noticed
that
would
have
given
rise
to
the
creation
of
rule
52.
and
what
the
court
said
there,
which
seems
to
me
to
apply
absolutely
and
completely
to
this
case,
is
that
such
a
practice,
which
is
never
useful
and
is
generally
harmful,
is
not
to
be
sanctioned.
i
would
urge
this
court
to
follow
that
mandate
in
this
case
and
affirm.
thank
you.
