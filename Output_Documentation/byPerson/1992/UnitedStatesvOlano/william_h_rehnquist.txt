we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
91-1306,
united
states
v.
guy
w.
olano.
general
starr.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
the
word
may
would
be
of
some
use
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
starr.
mr.
phillips,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
because,
mr.
phillips,
it
was,
this
procedure
was
consented
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
me
that
isn't
all
that
clear
that
that
was
an
objection.
i
mean,
you
can
read
that
a
couple
of
different
ways.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
go
seriatim
when
you're
arguing
before
nine
people?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
phillips,
what
if
one
of
the
jurors
had
not
been
properly
sworn
and
that
was
never
objected
to.
would
you
say
that
was
a
structural
error
that
was
kind
of
reversible
per
se?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
you,
surely
the
ninth
circuit
could
stop
it
by
simply
saying
that
we
don't
want
anybody
to
do
it
in
this
circuit
any
more
without
reversing
a
judgment
that
took
3
months
to
get
tried.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
refer
in
terms
to
rule
52?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
it,
did
the
opinion
really
talk
in
terms
of
plain
error?
i
mean,
i
kind
of
read
it
saying
there
has
been
a
violation
of
rule
24(c).
this
is
inherently
prejudicial,
there
is
no
consent,
therefore
it
is
reversed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that,
i
think
that's
rather
important
because
if
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
refer
to
rule
52
or
even
if
it
doesn't
refer
to
the
may
language
in
rule
52,
i
think
it's
hard
to
say
they're
exercising
their
discretion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
we're
talking
about
discretion
in
the
first
place
can
we
say
as,
can
we
say
that
we
would...
are
you
saying
we
should
have
reversed
a
court
of
appeals
which
affirmed
this
conviction
after
going
through
the
same
analysis
and
saying
we
choose
not
to
notice
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
know
that
it
had
any
discretion?
what
if
it
felt
that
it
was
simply
obligated
once
it
found
plain
error
to
reverse?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
rule
52
in
effect
at
the
time
of
brasfield?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
general
starr,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
