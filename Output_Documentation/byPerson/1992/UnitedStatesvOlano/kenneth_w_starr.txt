mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
brings
before
the
court
a
single
question,
whether
allowing
alternate
jurors
to
be
present
during
jury
deliberations
in
violation
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
constitutes
automatic
reversible
error
under
the
plain
error
rule.
the
background
of
the
case
and
the
pertinent
events
at
trial
we
think
are
important
and
can
be
very
briefly
described.
the
case
arises
out
of
an
elaborate
financial
fraud
scheme
culminating
in
a
3-month
trial
in
the
western
district
of
washington
before
now
chief
judge
barbara
rothstein.
toward
the
conclusion
of
this
trial
the
district
judge
suggested
to
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
council
that
two
alternate
jurors,
who
were
to
be
designed
as
such
at
the
close
of
trial,
be
allowed
to
remain
with
the
jury.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
so,
justice
blackmun,
although
we
concede,
justice
blackmun,
that
this
was
a
violation
of
the
federal
rules.
and
the
reason
that
i
suggest
that
it's
not
that
unusual,
at
least
where
it's
consented
to,
is
based
upon
my
understanding
that
the
practice
does
in
fact
prevail
in
certain
courts
in
the
united
states.
it
certainly
is
fairly
common
in
the
state
court
systems,
it
is
not
at
all
unusual.
and
in
this
particular
case
what
judge
rothstein
seemed
to
be
pointing
to
was
the
fact
that
this
was
an
extraordinarily
long
trial,
this
had
been
a
very
dutiful
jury,
it
had
been
very
attentive,
permitted
to
take
notes,
and
it
was
obvious
to
all
concerned
that
this
jury
was
a
jury
that
had
focus,
not
falling
asleep
at
the
switch,
and
the
like.
and
so--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
don't
exaggerate
the
point.
if
i
said...
perhaps
i
should
say
not
uncommon.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
justice
stevens,
it
is
my
understanding
that
judges,
for
example
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
have
engaged
in
this
practice
and
do
engage
in
the
practice,
and
that
judges
in
the
northern
district
of
california
engage
in
the
practice.
judge
rothstein
in
her
comments
said
many
judges
do
this
where
there
is
consent,
and
i
think
that
is
the
key.
is
there
consent.
because
under
law
of
the
ninth
circuit
if
there
is
a
stipulation,
then
it's
all
right.
no
harm,
no
foul,
which
is
ultimately
what
i
think
this
case
is
about.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
should
be
stopped,
and
i
think
the
way
to
do
that,
justice
stevens,
is
through
the
vehicle,
i
think
the
didactic
quality
of
an
opinion
issuing
from
this
court
will
be
helpful.
obviously
people
are
now
focusing
on
it.
recall
in
our
adversary
system
the
difficulty
when
at
the
end
of
a
3-month
trial,
and
you
have
tried
these
kinds
of
cases,
it
is
extremely
difficult,
everyone
is
tired,
and
the
prosecutor
said
on
the
record
at
about
this
time,
i
had
no
sleep
last
night.
they
are
moving
along
very
quickly
and
no
one
called
24(c)
to
the
judge's
attention,
and
she
was
obviously
laboring
under
a
misapprehension.
several
misapprehensions,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
about--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
is
correct.
that's
exactly
what
the
rules
provide.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
i
fully
disagree
with
that
because
if
this
is
plain
error,
if
this
is
noted
as
plain
error
then
this
court
will
have
affected
a
transformation
of
plain
error
law.
may
i
turn
to
that?
what
this
court
said
is
that
rule
52(b)
simply
codified
existing
law.
when
we
look
to
what
existing
law
was
which
was
being
qualified
we
were
talking
about
the
wiborg
case,
the
earliest
case
noted
by
the
advisory
committee
in
an
opinion
of
this
court
where
there
was
none,
zero
evidence
of
guilt
on
the
part
of
persons
who
had
been
convicted
along
with
the
ship
captain.
the
ship
captain
was
appropriately
convicted
of
this
crime,
but
several
crew
persons
were
also
convicted,
and
this
court
said
no
evidence
whatsoever.
that's
why
this
court
in
frady
and
in
young
has
spoken
very
clearly
about
egregious
errors
that
would
result
in
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
justice
stevens,
i
think
it
would
be
quite
a
new
day
and
an
unfortunate
new
day
if
we
decided
that
the
plain
error
rule
just
means
well,
it's
an
obvious
error
and
we're
going
to
send
the
message
to
the
lower
courts.
that
is
not
what
plain
error
has
been
meant
to
do.
that's
why
we
have
the
federal
judicial
center,
that's
why
we
have
educational
programs
for
judges,
that's
why
we
have
a
responsibility
at
the
justice
department
to
educate
our
prosecutors
and
to
make
sure--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--there
is
no
sanction
in
the
sense
of
a
reversal
of
a
conviction--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--because
of
this,
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
there
need
be
no
sanction
at
all
other
than
the
pedagogical
didactic
sanction
of
judges
now
being
informed
across
the
country
there
is
rule
24(c)
and
it
should
be
abided
by.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
judges,
justice
stevens,
will
not
abide
by
the
rules
if
it's
brought
to
their
attention.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
if
there
had
been
an
objection
then
we
would
have
quite
a
different
matter.
forgive
me,
yes.
the
difficulty
here--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--there
might,
in
rule--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
am
accepting
justice
stevens'
question
the
way
it
was
presented,
but
let
me
say,
justice
stevens,
that
if
this
is
a
matter
that
is
suggested
to
be
something
went
wrong,
and
that
happens.
this
court
is
familiar
and
has
had
cases
involving
something
going
wrong.
rule
606
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
provides
for
such
a
procedure.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
it
would
require--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
is
delicate,
but
i
think
that
the
court
could
conduct,
and
courts
do
this,
conduct
a
voir
dire
and
not
seek
to
intrude
into
the
deliberative
process,
but
simply
to
make
a
determination
whether
there
was
a
violation
and
the
nature
of
the
violation.
not
the
impact
that
the
violation
may
have
had,
let's
start
interviewing
jurors
and
say
what
did
that
statement
mean
to
you
when
the
alternates
stayed
there.
but
in--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
could
rise
to...
i
think
we
would
take
it
through
a
different...
it
might,
but
i
think
what
we
would
take
it
through,
justice
o'connor,
is
a
harmless
error
analysis.
we
would
then
be
in
52(a)
territory.
we
would
be
applying
the
kotteakos
standard
of
substantial
and
injurious
effect
on
the
verdict.
it
might
very
well
be
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i'm
suggesting
plain
error
goes
beyond
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
exactly,
justice
white.
plain
error
is
miscarriage
of
justice.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it's
very
interesting,
justice
stevens.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
plain
error
or
defects
affecting
substantial
rights
is
the
wording
of
the
rule.
i
think
you
could
engage--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
it
does.
i
think
it
does.
but
this
court
has
said,
and
i
think...
this
is
a
rule
addressed
to
trial
lawyers
and
trial
judges.
it
is
against
the
culture
of
understanding
of
what
the
rules
are.
and
what
the
rules
were,
what
the
plain
error
rule
was
meant
was
not
to
affect
a
transformation
of
the
adversary
system
saying
don't
worry
about
the
contemporaneous
objection
requirement,
don't
worry
if
the
judge
seems
to
be
falling
into
error.
go
ahead
and
enjoy
the
windfall
of
a
reversal
of
a
conviction
that
took
3
months.
and
this
was
a
very
dutiful
jury,
noted
by
judge
rothstein
in
her
dismissal.
in
her
expressing
thanks
to
this
jury
she
said
you
have
been
remarkable
for
your
patience,
your
attentitiveness,
and
what
i
think
the
real
miscarriage
of
justice
is
here
is
throwing
out
the
verdict
for
this
kind
of
violation.
that's
the
miscarriage
of
justice,
to
tell
shirley
kinsella--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
if
they
are
alternate
jurors
who
are
under
the
instruction--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--different
case
because
he
is
not
under
oath.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
justice
stevens,
i
believe
it
does.
and
the
seventh
circuit
so
found
in
johnson
against
duckworth.
it
found
that
the
alternates
in
that
indiana
case,
where
it
is
a
common
practice,
were
in
fact
under
oath--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
have
not
conducted
a
survey,
and
i
am
not
aware
of
any
survey
having
been
done.
i
have
had--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i'm
not
saying
it's
a
common
practice--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
thought
i
said
it
is
a
not
uncommon
practice
and
it
does
occur
in
some
jurisdictions
including,
i
am
informed,
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
and
i
think
if
the
court
inquires
of
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
will
find
as
so.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
do
not.
but
i
know
that
some
judges
have
that
practice,
and
it
may
be
that
they
brought
the
practice
with
them
from
state
court.
they
should
not
do
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
they
were
under
oath.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
they
are
under
oath
all
the
way
through.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
there
were
14
fungible
jurors.
they
didn't
know,
shirley
kinsella
did
not
know
she
was--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
certainly
there
is
a
violation
of
the
judge's
instruction
and
thus
it
makes--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--then
we
take
it
through
a
harmless
error
analysis,
did
that
substantially
affect
the
verdict.
and
in
that
hypothetical
i
think
it's
harmless
error.
it
is
error,
but
remember
there's
no
suggestion
here...
and
i
think
this
is
critical,
justice
kennedy,
these
parties
had
the
opportunity,
this
jury
was
brought
in,
they
acquitted
some
defendants
entirely,
the
exonerated
individuals
who
were
convicted
of
certain
counts.
the
defendants
said,
and
they
were
very
ably
represented
by
very
effective
counsel,
and
the
counsel
were
asked
do
you
want
to
poll
the
jury.
yes.
the
jury
was
polled.
not
a
peep,
nothing,
not
a
word
about
gee,
perhaps
shirley
kinsella
was
trying
to
drive
this
verdict.
none
whatsoever.
there
is
no
indication
at
all
that
the
procedure,
that
the
rules
of
evidence
have
even
occurred
to
defense
counsel.
and
you
know
why?
it
was
no
big
deal.
it
was
nothing
major.
it
was
one
of
myriad
activities,
claims,
issues,
questions,
that
had
to
be
focused
on.
as
everyone
who
has
tried
a
case
knows,
it
is
very
difficult
toward
the
close
of
trial.
you
are
racing
to
the
end,
you
are
making
very
difficult
calls
and
you
are
trying
to
make
them
quickly.
and
yes,
i
would
say
it
is
a
responsibility
of
the
prosecutor
to
bring
these
rules
to
the
attention.
why
didn't
the
prosecutor
do
it?
prosecutor
wasn't
focusing
on
it.
do
you
know
why
the
prosecutor
wasn't
focusing
on
it?
i'm
not
speaking
outside
the
record
because
we
know
what
happened
next.
he
had
his
closing
argument
next.
we
know
what
it's
like
to
do
a
closing
argument.
it
concentrates
the
mind.
this
was
no
big
deal,
and
judge
rothstein
said
if
any
of
you
have
a
problem
i
won't
do
it.
and
no
one
had
a
problem.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
none
whatsoever.
i
think
that
this
court's
decisions
in
a
variety
of
cases,
including
taylor
against
illinois,
says
that
the
vast
majority
of
decisions
are
entrusted
in
the
trial
process
to
trial
counsel,
and
counsel
speaks
for
the
defendant
in
any
number
of
terribly
important
issues.
and
to
suggest
that
this
rises
to
the
level
of
entering
a
guilty
plea
or
waiving
a
jury
trial
right
or
waiving
a
public
trial
right
is
simply
not,
it
seems
to
me
is
quite
far
fetched.
as
justice
marshall
said,
it's
too
extravagant
seriously
to
be
maintained.
this
is
not
that
kind
of
error.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
not
under
this
court's
interpretations.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
it
depends
on
how
you
punctuate...
i
disagree,
justice
white.
i
disagree.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
plain
errors
or
defects,
this
is
set
forth
in
our
brief
at
page
2,
plain
errors
or
defects
affecting
substantial
rights
may
be
noticed,
notice
the
word
may
which
this
court
has
emphasized,
although
they
were
not
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
we
believe
this
court
has
not
authoritatively--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
correct
as
long
as...
but
this
is
what
is
not
in
the
rule.
justice
stevens
make
a
valid
point.
this
is
not
in
the
language
of
the
rule
but
it's
in
the
language
of
this
court's
cases
in
frady
and
young,
and
it's
in
the
background
of
the
rule
which
is
we
have
to
be
talking
about
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
and
when
we
look
to
what
that
means,
what's
a
miscarriage
of
justice,
that
a
right--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--correct.
because
a
defect
that
affects
substantial
right
is
a
non-harmless
error.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
but
that...
and
i
think
that
suggests
that
the
matter
was--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no
great
concern.
footnote
14
was--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--also
frady,
which--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
but
we
also
have
the
text
in
both
frady
and
young
speaks
of
exceptional
circumstances
and
egregious
errors.
and
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--justice
white,
i'm
not
trying
to
be
argumentative.
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest
is
i
accept
your
two
points,
that
it
must
be
plain
in
the
sense
of
obvious
manifest
that
jumps
out
at
you.
i
am
willing
to
concede
that
that's
the
case
here.
affecting
substantial
rights,
that's
not
presented
here
because
we
don't
think
that
this
affects
substantial
rights
in
light
of
what
this--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--then
it
may
be
harmful
error
if
it
was
objected
to.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
where
i
part
company,
justice
white.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
and
the
reason
i
part
company
is
because
of
what
trial
practice
meant
to
the
drafters
of
rule
52(b).
plain
error
was
meant
to
save
the
innocent
who
otherwise
would
have
been
convicted,
or,
as
the
seventh
circuit
has
also
noted,
to
suggest
that
if
there
is
something
plain
and
just
wrong,
illegally
wrong
about
a
sentence,
you
may
notice
it.
notice
the
discretion,
that's
why
this
court's
cases
count.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
i
think
i
win
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
am
very
concerned,
however...
under
that
analysis
i
think
i
should
win
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
i
am
concerned,
however,
about
the
development
of
plain
error
doctrine.
and
to
suggest
that
any
error
satisfies
52(b)
when
it
is
plain
and
affects
substantial
rights
means
anything
that
is
not
in
(a)
is
automatically
in
the
category
of
(b)
and
may
be
noticeable
without
the
element
that
i
think
is
very
important
of
whether
there
was
a
miscarriage
of
justice,
whether
some
egregious
wrong
has
occurred
or--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--exactly,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
may
use
suggests
discretion,
and
this
court
has
guided
that
discretion
in
frady
and
in
young.
and
when
we
look
to
the
atkinson
case,
one
of
the
early
cases,
what
that
was
getting
at
as
well
was
concerns
about
the
public
reputation.
is
the
public
reputation
of
the
judiciary
at
stake,
is
it
at
risk
by
virtue
of
the
procedure
here.
let's
say
a
toomey
v.
ohio
kind
of
violation,
interested
financially,
interested
judge,
but
no
one
notices
it.
but
on
appeal
in
this
enlightened
appellate
system
a
court
of
appeals
notices
that
and
says
this
should
not
be
able
to
stand.
we
have
no
doubt
about
this
person's
guilt,
but
we
will
not
allow
this
judgment
to
stand
because
of
the
integrity
and
reputation
of
this
judiciary.
this
is
not
that
kind
of
error.
this
is
not
the
kind
of
error
that
should
give
individuals
pause,
any
lack
of
confidence
in
the
verdict
or
any
lack
of
confidence
in
our
judicial
system.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
that
52(a)
has
been
interpreted
quite
so
narrowly--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
the
court
has
placed
emphasis
on
these
different
formulations,
and
the
idea
of
fundamental
rights
may
in
fact
be
a
bit
broader
an
approach
than
substantial
rights.
but
i
think,
what
do
we
get
at,
let
us
not
engage
just
in
name,
in
word
games.
what
this
rule
is
about
is
whether
something
went
so
badly
awry
that
our
entire
adversary
system
should
suffer
quite
a
severe
blow,
that
we
should
in
fact
be
willing
to
reverse
a
conviction,
reverse
a
verdict
of
a
jury
properly
instructed
which
did
its
duty,
because
of
this
kind
of
error
not
brought
to
the
trial
judge's
attention.
and
that's
why
the
words
of
52(b)
should
not
be
interpreted
rawly
without
an
appreciation
of
the
backdrop
of
its
culture,
the
value
that
it
was
getting
at,
and
it
was
getting
at
fundamental
injustices.
i'd
like
to
reserve--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
i
think
that
is
necessary,
but
i
don't
think
it
was
meant
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
don't...
but
if
you
look
at
the
text
and
the
entirety
of
what
frady
says
and
then
what
young
says,
and
young
of
course
said
there
is
no...
i
think
one
of
the
dangers
in
the
dialogue
that
i
am
detecting
is
that
there
has
been
a
suggestion
that
a
per
se
approach
to
plain
error
is
appropriate,
but
that's--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--exactly.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
exactly.
and
what
frady
and
young
also
said
is
are
these
egregious
circumstances,
the
kind
like
in
wiborg
and
our
ship's
captains
case.
i
think
that
tells
us
what
the
drafters
had
in
mind
when
they
used
this
language.
plain
error
didn't
just
mean
oh,
gee,
that
was
an
obvious
one
now
that
we
have
focused
on
it.
plain
error
meant,
if
you
will,
as
justice
frankfurter
might
have
said,
the
conscience
of
this
court
has
been
shocked
because
these
poor
shipmates
should
not
be
languishing
in
jail
because
there
was
no
evidence
of
their
guilt.
that
was
the
culture.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
in
terms
of
a
miscarriage
of
justice
i
think
that
what
this
court
was
wrestling
with,
justice
stevens,
in
wiborg
was
that
kind
of
error,
not
a
technical
error
that
was
no
big
deal
in
the
course
of
a
3-month
trial.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i'm
not
willing
to
concede
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
i
believe
that
there
was
consent,
justice
thomas,
and
it
does
seem
to
me
that
that
does
in
fact
change
quite
considerably,
because
it
is
not
just
unobjected
to
but
the
parties
have
gone
beyond
that
and
said
we
agree
to
this
procedure.
now,
the
court
has
or
the
courts
have
said
that
certain
plain
errors
may
be
noted
even
though
there
may
have
been
procedure
agreed
to,
but
we
do
think
that
this
falls
into
the
category,
as
we
argue
at
some
length
in
our
reply
brief,
into
invited
error.
but
particularly
where
the
judge
is
saying
this
is
no
big
deal
but
i
do
want
you
to
at
least
consider
this
as
an
accommodation
to
the
jurors,
and
then
no
one,
of
all
those
defense
lawyers,
there
were
two
prosecutors
but
there
were
a
lot
of
defense
lawyers,
no
one
stood
up
and
said
24(c),
judge.
and
judge
rothstein
obviously
wasn't
focusing
on
24(c).
she
came
out
of
the
culture
that
many
judges
do
this.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
where
there
is
consent
here
there
certainly
is
no
miscarriage
of
justice,
as
this
court
has
indicated
plain
error
is
all
about.
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
several
brief
points.
first,
there
is
no
need,
as
mr.
phillips
suggests,
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
reverse
a
district
court
in
order
to
send
a
message.
courts
of
appeals
frequently
carry
on
a
didactic
function
in
their
opinions.
that's
why
opinions
say
something
more
than
affirmed
and
reversed
for
the
following
three
reasons.
it
is
an
extraordinary
expense
for
the
system
to
send
a
message,
a
powerful
message
that
can't
be
ignored,
but
it
is
indicative
of
the
extravagance
of
the
remedy
below
that
the
trial
counsel
in
this
case
chose
not
to
send
a
message
to
the
district
judge
nor
even
to
the
courts
of
appeals,
for
in
this
multi-defendant
case
only
mr.
olano,
an
able
lawyer
in
his
own
right
who
went
into
the
savings
and
loan
business
in
louisiana,
chose
to
present
this
issue
to
the
court
of
appeals.
none
of
the
other
respondents
raised
this,
none
of
the
other
defendants
in
their
various
appeals
even
asserted
the
point.
it
was
so
unplain
in
the
sense
of
a
miscarriage
of
justice
that
not
even
counsel,
including
a
professor
at
the
university
of
southern
california
law
center,
bothered
to
note
it.
this
is
not
the
arena
of
miscarriage
of
justice,
which
is
not
in
the
footnote
of
frady,
it's
in
the
text
of
frady
that
that
is
what
the
plain
error
rule
is
all
about.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
plain
error
in
the
sense
of
obvious,
i
think
it
does
satisfy
that.
but
yes,
we
would
still
take
the
error
through
a
harmless
error
analysis
if
it
had
been
objected,
assuming
that
it
had
been
objected
to.
and
that's
one
of
the
things,
by
the
way,
when
he
began,
when
mr.
phillips
began
with
his
reading
of
the
rules
he
focused
on
24(c).
he
never
got
to
51
and
the
premises
of
the
adversary
system.
that's
in
our
brief
at
page
3.
that
is
the
way
our
system
works.
we
have
a
system
where
individuals
have
counsel,
counsel
represent
them,
and
counsel
are
there
to
guide
the
judge,
to
express
reservations,
to
interpose
objections,
to
say
no,
your
honor,
with
all
respect
that
procedure
is
not
permitted
under
the
federal
rules.
no
one
did
that
here.
the
chief
justice
is
quite
correct.
at
most
there
was
this
ambiguous
statement
moving
very
quickly
through
this
process
where
one
counsel
said,
and
all
counsel,
by
the
way,
the
understanding
at
this
trial,
the
record
is
clear
on
this,
is
one
counsel
spoke
for
all.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
this
court
has
so
held
in
henderson
against
kibbe
and
also--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
is
correct.
we're
not
quarreling
with
that,
but
we
do
think
nonetheless
this
court
has
been
clear
that
there
must
be
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
here
there
is
so
plainly,
i
think
to
the
reason--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
it
is
also
the
standard
that
this
court
has
articulated
in
frady
itself
as
to
what
this
is
all
about.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it's
difficult
to
say,
but
it
seems
to
me,
because
the
court
has
not
elaborately
articulated
what
it
is,
i
do
think,
despite,
if
i
may
say
so
with
all
respect,
the
looseness
of
the
language,
that
rule
52(b)
is
aimed
at
getting
at
miscarriages
of
justice.
that
is
i
think
what
52(b)
was
all
about.
now,
in
terms
of
cause
analysis
and
the
sorts
of
things
that
we
would
be
focusing
on
and
the
additional
interests
that
are
at
stake
with
respect
to
a
collateral
challenge,
obviously
those
do
not
obtain
here.
much
has
been
said
about
discretion,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
what
this
court
has
been
saying
for
a
number
of
years,
and
i
hope
that
message
does
not
change,
is
that
this
is
a
rule
that
is
to
be
used
very
sparingly
because
of
the
premises
of
our
adversary
system.
it
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no.
no,
because
i
think
no
harm,
no
foul,
to
the
extent
that
it
is
being
used,
i
think
it
is
used
only
with
consent
and--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
there's
no
question,
we
don't
have
a
problem
with
a
rule.
we're
not
suggesting
one.
the
question
here
in
this
case
is
what
happens
when,
as
frequently
happens
at
any
trial,
there
are
mistakes,
there
are
errors,
how
do
we
treat
those
errors.
do
we
say
we're
going
to
disrupt
the
justice
system,
including
the
considered
verdict
of
a
jury
that,
if
i
may
say
one
word
about
this
jury
verdict--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
rule
52(b).
i
think
that
is
true,
that
52(b)
could
be
more,
could
be
clearer.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
our
understanding,
and
it
is
my
understanding
and
i
so
represent
to
the
court
that
the
two
prosecutors
were
not
privy
to
those
conversations.
so
i
cannot
represent
what
took
place,
but
it
is
clearly
outside
the
record.
when
they
went
back...
i'm
sorry.
