then
even
without
an
objection
might
there
not
be
actual
harm
in
some
situations?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
always
rolling
the
dice
when
you
violate
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
even
know
who
they
are,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me,
why
doesn't
affecting
substantial
rights
carry
that
water?
i
mean,
why
can't
you
find
all
of
that,
all
of
that
burden
resting
upon
the
phrase
affecting
substantial
rights,
and
say
look
it,
when
you
have
an
extra
juror
who
has
been
sworn,
you
know,
up
until
this
time
hadn't
even
know
that
she
was
the
alternate,
it's
a
violation
of
the
rule
but
there
is
no
substantial
right
affected.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
for
that,
then
what
you
were
talking
about
earlier,
the
inconsistency
of
the
verdict,
the
fact
that
five
defendants
were
just
set
free
because
there
was
no
evidence,
that's
all
irrelevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
for
that
theory
it
is.
