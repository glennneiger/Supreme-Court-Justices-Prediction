chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
92-6033,
william
mcneil
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
shoenberger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
we're...
mr.
shoenberger,
we're
talking
really
a
question
of
law
here,
not
what
someone
may
have
reasonably
believed,
unless
the
law
makes
what
someone
reasonably
believed,
rather
than
what
actually
was,
relevant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
do
you
keep
mentioning
your
client's
reasonable
belief
in
something?
does
the
law...
does
the
statute
give
any
reason
why
reasonable
belief
should
be
important?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
one
were
to
read
the
text
of
2675(a),
which
is
one
of
the
statutes
with
you,
"an
action
shall
not
be
instituted
upon
a
claim
against
the
united
states
for
money
damages
unless
the
claimant
shall
have
first
presented
the
claim
to
the
appropriate
federal
agency
and
his
claim
shall
have
been
finally
denied
by
the
agency
in
writing.
"
that
suggests
that
whatever
you...
whatever
you
filed
in
march
simply
was
not...
was
not
permissible
under
the
statute
because
"an
action
shall
not
be
instituted.
"
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
was
the
letter
which
he
received...
was
it
certified
or
registered?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
point
raised
by
you
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
raised
by
whoever
represented
him
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
raised
by
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
asking
you
a
very
specific
question,
mr.
shoenberger,
and
i
think
it's
capable
of
being
answered
yes
or
no.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
he
wasn't
contending
there,
then,
that
the
mailing
he
received
was
inadequate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then
are
you...
are
you
here
making
a...
i
thought
from
what
you
remarked
a
moment
ago
that
you
are
here
making
a
point
that
because
there
was...
there's
no
evidence
the
denial
was
sent
by
certified
or
regisetered
mail,
that
that
has
some
bearing
on
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--do
you
make
a
point
here
of
your
claim
that
the
denial
from
the
agency
was
not
sent
by
certified
or
registered
mail?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
am
i
right
in
thinking
you
make
no
point
of
failure
to
certify
or
register
here,
in
your
case
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
cite
matthews
against
diaz
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
i
didn't
see
it
in
the
index.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
reply
brief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
your
client
had
failed
to
file
any
sort
of
a
paper
in
court
in
march,
eventually
his
claim
would
have
simply
disappeared
by
virtue
of
the
running
of
the...
either
the
statute
of
limitations,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
again,
yeah,
why...
why
is
this
at
all
important
in
our
disposition
of
the
question
presented,
what
he
believed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
in
the
statute
does
it
talk
about
anybody's
honest
belief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
why
do
you
raise
it
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
do
you
think
"institute"...
well
do
you
think
"instituted"
means
something
much
different
from
commenced?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
fact
that
you...
you
can't
use
one
word
for
everything
you
can
use
the
other
word
for
doesn't
mean
that
in
the...
in
the
area
where
they
have
common
application
the
meaning
may
not
be
the
same.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
definition
of
the
word
"institute"
out
of
a
dictionary?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
talks
about
a
service
or
a
filing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
what
statutory
definition
of
"institute"
are
you
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
were
referring
a
moment
ago
to...
that
the
word
"institute"
meant
two
stages
or
something
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
shoenberger.
mr.
kelley,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
kelley.
mr.
shoenberger,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
he
stated
that
he
thought
it
was
unnecessary
for
the
court
to
decide,
the
majority
to
decide
as
it
did,
the
question
on
which
the
circuits
are
split,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shoenberger.
