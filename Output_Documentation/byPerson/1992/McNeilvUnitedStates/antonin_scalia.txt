justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
it
doesn't
say
i
am
filing
a
case
right
now.
it
says...
it
says
if
you
accept
the
letter,
then
i
can...
i
will
be
able
to
commence
my
legal
action.
it
doesn't
say
i
am
hereby
commencing
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
it
says
it
"can
properly
commence".
it
says,
"whereas
plaintiff
can
properly
commerce
his
legal
action
accordingly.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
that
means
i
am
now
able
to
commence
my
legal
action.
not
i
have
commenced
it
or
i
am
commencing
it,
but
i
can
commence
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
think
it's
too
much
to
insist
if
you
want
one...
one
document
to
be
accepted
for
another
one,
that
he's
saying
i'm
filing
a
complaint.
i
mean,
not
if
you
accept
this
letter,
i'll
be
able
to
file
a
complaint
or
i
can
file
a
complaint.
really,
you
don't
have
to
be
a
law
school
graduate
to
speak
english,
and
i
don't
know
why
we
have
to
bend
over
backwards
for
prose
litigants
to
make
them
say
something
they
haven't
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shoenberger,
you
know
i
didn't
really
think
we
were
going
to
get
into
whether...
i
didn't
think
we
had
taken
the
case
to
try
to
figure
out
whether
this
august
7
letter
was
a
proper
commencement
of
the
suit
or
not.
how
is
this
set
forth
in
the
questions
presented?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what...
which
question
being
what?
how?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what...
that's
fine.
as
i
have
your
questions
presented
in
your
brief,
and
you
cannot
bring
in...
since
you're
seeking
to
overturn
the
decision
below,
you
can't
bring
in
outside
arguments
for
the
purpose
of
sustaining
it.
your
question
presented
in
your
brief
is
whether
an
incomplete
filing
of
a
federal
tort
claims
act...
an
incomplete
filing
may
be
perfected
by
filing
a
notice
of
final
agency
denial.
not
a
document
which
could
be
considered
a
proper
complaint,
but
by
filing
a
notice
of
final
agency
denial
prior
to
substantial
progress.
that
was
your
first
question.
your
second
question
is
may
the
united
states
bar
a
suit
when
the
prose
prisoner
files
a
premature
suit
but
satisfies
the
congressional
requirement
by
filing
a
final
agency
denial
prior
to
substantial
progress.
now,
that
is
a
significant
legal
issue
on
which
there's
dispute
around
the
country.
there
really
isn't
very
much
dispute
around
the
country
on
the
meaning
of
this
letter
of
august
7,
and
i
don't
think
we
would
have
taken
the
case
to
decide
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
can
we
talk
about
the
legal
issues
that
were
the
subject
of
the
petition.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shoenberger,
as
i
understand
your
position,
it's
that
the
failure
to
comply
with
2675(a)
should
not
automatically
result
in
dismissal;
that
it
should
depend
on
how
far
the
lawsuit
has
progressed.
and
the
further
it's
progressed,
the
more
ready
you
should
be
to
dismiss
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
why--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it
hasn't
gone...
if
it
hasn't
proceeded
very
far,
you
dismiss
it.
or
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
that.
i
mean
i
would
think
just
the
opposite
ought
to
be
true,
that
if
it
has
come
a
long
way
you
shouldn't
dismiss
it.
why
does
your
rule
make
any
more
sense
than
the
opposite?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
if
the
government
wants
to...
wait
a
minute,
now.
the
further
along
it
is,
the
more...
the
more
ready
you
should
be
to
dismiss
it,
yeah?
justice
antonin
scalia
gee.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
the
government
should
really
let
all
these
suits
go
on
as
long
as
possible,
waste
as
much
judicial
resources
as
possible,
and
only
then
when
the
judgment
is
about
to
come
down,
the
government
gets
up,
your
honor
we
move
to
dismiss
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
whenever
we
grant
certiorari,
we
don't
know
what
issues
we're
going
to
have
to
decide--
justice
antonin
scalia
--even
on
behalf
of
the
petitioner.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
i
can
understand
the
person
who's
trying
to
sustain
the
judgment
below
coming
in
and
saying,
you
know,
this
wasn't
raised
in
the
petition,
but
i'm
entitled
to
my
judgment
on
the
basis
of
this
other
issue.
but
for
the
petitioner
to
come
in
and
give
us
one
issue
in...
you
know,
a
teaser
in
the
petition,
and
then
come
in
and
argue
a
totally
different
issue.
i,
you
know...
i,
frankly,
would
not
have
been
interested
in
discussing
the
meaning
of
this
august
7
letter.
i
know
it's
important
to
your
client,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
to
the
country.
