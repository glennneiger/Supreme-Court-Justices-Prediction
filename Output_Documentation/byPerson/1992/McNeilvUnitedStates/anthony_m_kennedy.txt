justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
there
anything
to
indicate
that
the
district
court
acted
to
grant
this
implied
motion
under
15...
under
rule
15(d)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
rather
odd
to
rely,
then,
on
an
implied
motion
that
the
district
court
has
not
even
seen,
much
less
acted
on--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
cure
a
defective
pleading.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
a
copy
of
that
letter
served
on
or
sent
to
the
government?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
mean
it
stretches...
it
stretches
again
the
argument
for
the
implied
rule
15(d)
motion
to
say
that
it's
a...
it's
a
motion
for
a
supplemental
pleading
when
it's
not
even
served
on
the
government.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
that
within
the
limitations
period,
a
formal
rule
15(d)
motion
is
applied
moving
that
the
court
construe
the
complaint
that
was
previously
filed
as
a
newly
filed
complaint.
is
there
any
problem
with
that?
