does
that
mean
that
at
the
time
this
man
wrote
his
letter
to
the
agency,
the
agency
really
didn't
have
any
authority
to
settle?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
with
regard
to
the
issue
before...
you
know,
the
particular
legal
issue...
are
the
cases
that
go
the
other
way
from
the
seventh
circuit
and
say
that
you
can
treat
the
case
as
being
filed
after
there's
a
denial
if
there's
been
no
substantial
progress
in
the
litigation,
are
they
all
prose
cases?

john
paul
stevens

puzzling
as
to
know
why...

is
pretty
plain.
it's
puzzling
as
to
why
a
lawyer
would--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
way
for
not
having
to
reach
the
issue
we
granted
cert
to
decide.
