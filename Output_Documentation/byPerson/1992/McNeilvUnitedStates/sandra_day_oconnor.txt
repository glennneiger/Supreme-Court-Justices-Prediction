let
me
stop
you
there.
now,
do
you
say
that
his
claim
was
actually
denied
in
writing?
and
if
so,
which
letter
do
we
look
to?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
your
position?
what
letter
do
we
look
to
as
a
denial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
your
position
on
his
behalf?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
your
position
on
his
behalf?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
we
go
this
far,
because
that's
where
we
are
chronologically,
you
say
that
the
two
letters,
somehow
combined,
are
a
denial.
because
there
certainly
wasn't
the
passage
of
6
months,
was
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
by
the
time
he
filed
suit
in
march.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
6
months
had
not
elapsed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
would
have
to
say
somehow
those
two
letters
were
a
denial.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
you
don't
take
the
position,
do
you,
that
the
august
7th
letter
is
a
complaint--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
an
action?
you
rely
on
the
complaint
filed
back
in
march.
