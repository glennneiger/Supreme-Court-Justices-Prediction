mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
today
is
a
single
one,
whether
or
not
mr.
mcneil
can
have
his
day
in
court
on
the
merits
in
the
case
he
alleged.
his
suit
alleges
experimentation
for
aids
and
hepatitis
purposes
without
his
consent.
the
government
answered
agreeing
that
it
had
funded
the
research
on
male
prisoners,
but
claims
that
the
research
was
done
on
him
voluntarily.
we
believe
the
court
can
answer
the
question
presented
in
this
case
without
reaching
all
of
the
many
questions
presented
in
the
briefs
in
this
case.
in
particular,
we
believe
the
case
can
be
answered
on
the
argument
that
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
rule
15(d)
means
that
he
perfected
his
march,
1989
filing
by
the
august,
1989
letter
for
filing
that
he
sent
to
the
court.
that
appears
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
10.
the
case
is
not
about
exhaustion.
mr.
mcneil
clearly
exhausted
the
federal
administrative
remedies.
indeed,
we
think
he
at
least
exhausted
it
twice,
but
certainly
he
exhausted
it
once
and
got
a
letter
from
the
federal
government
saying
that
he
had
a
right
to
sue.
however,
the
case
is
rather
complicated
on
its
facts
and
i
would
like
to
run
through
a
number
of
those
major
facts
to
show
the
events.
the
case
began
when
he
filed,
in
at
least
january
of
1989,
an
administrative
claim.
in
that
same
month,
a
letter
was
sent
by
the
administrative
agency
saying
that
his
administrative
claim,
which
it
was
labeled,
was
being
sent
to
a
claims
officer.
and
he
was
told
that
if
the
case
was
not
settled,
he
would
have
to
bring
a
lawsuit.
in
february
of
1989,
he
received
another
letter
from
that
same
administrative
agency,
this
letter
saying
that
no
records
could
be
found
to
indicate
that
such
experimentation
had
been
conducted
with
the
federal
government
being
involved.
after
those
two
letters,
mr.
mcneil
believed,
apparently,
that
he
had
an
obligation
to
sue
or
his
rights
would
be
lost.
he
brought
suit
in
march
of
1989
and
included
with
that
suit
a
motion
for
leave
to
proceed
in
forma
pauperis.
in
1989
in
may--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--he
believes
or
he
believed
that
his
claim
was
denied.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
you
look
to...
he
believed
that
the
combination
of
the
january
24th
letter
and
the
february...
i
believe
it's
9th
letter,
put
together,
were
a
denial
of
his
claim.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that
is
certainly
a
reasonable
position.
i
believe
a
stronger
position--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--it's
part
of
our...
my
position
on
his
behalf.
i
think
the
better
position
or
the
stronger
position
is
that
the
august
filing,
the
letter
that
was
contained
in
august,
certainly
constituted
an
adequate
filing
for
purposes
of
this
suit.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that's
correct.
there
was...
well,
there
was
by
august
of
1989,
there
was
the
passage
of
6
months.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that's
correct,
there
were
not--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--that's
correct.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that's...
that
was
clearly
what
he
believed.
as
a
prose
litigant,
he
clearly
believed
that
and
he
clearly
articulated
that
to
the
seventh
circuit
in
his
reply
brief.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
the
statute
on
its
text
neither
refers
to
reasonable
belief...
nor
does
the
statute,
we
believe,
in
its
text
indicate
the
remedy
that
should
occur
should
a
premature
filing,
if
this
is
deemed
a
premature
filing...
had
been
made.
so
the
text
is
absent
that
would
answer
this
case,
except
for
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure,
rule
15(d),
which
explicitly
speaks
to
the
case
and
we
believe
explicitly
cures
any
defect
that
might
have
been
made
in
the
original
filing.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
well,
what...
we
contest,
of
course,
whether
"instituted"
means
the
same
as
commenced.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
but
he
believed
that
he
had
his
denial,
and
the
statute
is
only
clear
if
you
look
at
the
method
it
specifies
for
notifying
the
denial,
which
refers
to
certified
or
registered
mail.
unfortunately,
mr.
mcneil
was
a
prisoner,
and
as
a
practical
matter
unless
a
letter
includes
within
its
text
a
reference
to
certified
or
registered
mail,
he
would
not
know
whether
or
not
the
letter
was
certified
or
registered,
because
that
kind
of
documentation
does
not
normally
come
forward
to
prisoners,
at
least
in
most
of
the
prisons
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
and
so
he
had...
he
had
a
gap
in
knowledge.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
the
record
does
not
indicate
whether
either
the
january,
1989
letter
or
the
february,
1989
letter
were
either
registered
or
certified.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
i
did
not
represent
him
in
the
district
court.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
he
represented
himself
prose.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
he
did
raise
the
argument
that
he
had
made
a
sufficient
filing--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--i
believe
he
did
assert
specifically
that
he
had
notice
in
march
of
1989
in
connection
with
these
two
letters
that
allowed
him
the
right...
a
permission
to
sue.
he
said
that
specifically
to
the
federal
district
court.
in--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--no.
i
think
he
thought
the
mailings
were
adequate
to
inform
him
that
the
federal
government
had
said
his
claim
was
denied.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
in
the
august,
1989
filing
that
he
made,
in
his
letter
requesting
to
commence
the
litigation,
attached
to
that
letter...
that
letter
was
the
sum
certain
denial
that
was
sent
in
july
of
1989.
and
internally,
that
says
that
it
was
sent
by
certified
mail,
return
receipt
requested.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that
is,
the
letter
contained
that
particular
language.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that
as
far
as
we
know,
in
august...
in
july
of
1989
it
was
sent
by
certified
mail,
because
that's
what
the
letter
says.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
we
certainly
don't,
because
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record...
and
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
would
seem
to
suggest
it
was,
but
we
don't
know
that
as
a
fact.
and
as
i
said,
mr.
mcneil
doesn't
know
that
as
a
fact,
can't
know
that
as
a
fact
by
the
way
mail
is
processed
in
the
prison.
but
in
any
case,
the
government,
as
we
understand
it,
agrees
that
that
july,
1989
letter
was
a
sum
certain
denial.
we
think
that's
uncontroverted
in
the
record
and
any
of
the
briefs
that
have
come
up
on
appeal,
either
in
the
seventh
circuit
or
in
briefs
to
this
court.
however,
rule...
rule
15(d),
it
seems
to
us,
is
a
completely
adequate
way
of
dealing
with
the
particular
problem.
if
i
could
ask
your
court...
the
court
to
refer
to
the
joint
appendix,
page
10,
that's
his
august
filing.
and
that
filing
in
its
text
seems
quite
clear.
it
says
he
got
his
second
sum
certain
denial,
which
was
attached
to
that...
it's
the
july,
1989
sum
certain
denial.
and
it's...
he
says
he's
sending
that
second
text,
second
denial,
to
the
federal
district
court.
it
also
states
he
was,
in
fact,
infected
with
hepatitis.
it
tells
the
court
that
he
had
paid
the
filing
fee
for
the
case
in
may
of
1989,
although
in
june
of
1989
the
federal
district
court
did
not
apparently
know
that
and
stayed
all
further
proceedings
until
it
ruled
on
the
in
forma
pauperis
motion.
there
were
a
number
of
documents
that
apparently
were
mislaid
in
mr.
mcneil's
case
by
the
federal
district
court.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
we--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--no.
we
take...
we
believe
that
the
august
letter
is
at
least
construable
in
two
different
ways.
that
it's
a
proper
rule
15(d)
supplement
that
perfects
the
original
march
filing,
or,
alternatively,
that
it
is,
in
fact,
a
complaint
under
haines
v.
kerner,
to
be
construed
liberally
in
terms
of
its
text.
so
that
on
either
of
those
grounds...
if
you
find
for
mr.
mcneil
on
either
of
those
grounds,
the
case
was
validly...
was
validly
filed
and
perfected,
either
filed
in
august
of
1989
or
perfected
in
august
of
1989,
and
that
he
has
an
ability
to
go
forward
with
the
suit.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
there
is
no
indication
that
the
federal
district
court
ever
saw
this
letter
of
august
7th
and
the
attachments.
there
is
no
reference
in
the
opinion
at
the
district
court
level
that
it
was
ever
paid
any
attention
to,
and
so
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
but
it
was
filed.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
but
it
was
filed.
and
i
would
suggest
if
you
look
at
the
language
that
is
the
last
part,
sentence,
"plaintiff
prays
this
honorable
court
accepts
this
letter
as
a
proper
request,
whereas
plaintiff
can
properly
commence
his
legal
action
accordingly.
"
if...
and
we
disagree.
if
the
word
2675...
and
both
of
those
words
mean
filed,
if
the
statutory
language
is
to
bear
that
interpretation,
his
letter
should
bear
that
same
interpretation,
being
in
the
same
context.
and
that
means
that
this
particular
last
sentence
or
last
half
sentence
should
be
interpreted
as
him
saying
i
want
to
file
a
case
right
now,
let's
get
the
case
going.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
if
the...
if
commencing
means
filed,
if
that's
the
statutory
interpretation
from
2675
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
right.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
well,
i
think...
i
think
his
subjective
intent
may
very
well
have
been
that
he
simply
wanted
the
prior
filing
to
start
going
forward.
but
he
was
a
layperson
and
he
certainly
had
no
great
familiarity
with
rule
15(d).
he
also
had
no
great
familiarity
with
the
120
plus
odd
words
that
are
the
first
two
sections
of
section
2675.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
well,
i
don't
think
you
have
to
bend
over
backwards.
i
think
it's
quite
reasonable
to
interpret
this
language,
without
any
stretching
of
the
language,
to
say
here
is
a
filing.
the
case
is
filed,
i
have
a
right
to
sue,
i
have
complied
with
the
exhaustion
requirements
of
2675
twice,
i
have
two
sum
certain
denials,
that
he
explicitly
says.
he
explicitly
says
i
have
been
infected
with
hepatitis.
there
is
reference
to
the
theories,
through
some
of
the
attachments
to
the
letter
that
was
contained.
it's
clearly
a
federal
tort
claims
act
case
that
he's
dealing
with.
he
cites
the
caption
number
of
the
prior
case.
he
doesn't,
indeed,
label
it
a
complaint,
but
it's
only
the
absence
of
the
word
"complaint"
that
means
that
this
is
not
a
sufficient
new
filing.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
i
do
not
believe
so.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
so.
in
fact,
it's...
since
the
only
time
the
federal
government
and
the
district
court
indicated
it
was
aware
that
an
administrative
claim
had
been
filed
in
january
of
1989
is
in
their
response
brief
to
his
response
to
their
motion
to
dismiss,
i
don't
believe
they
ever
checked
the
record
in
this
case
to
see
what
was
in
the
record--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--in...
this
court
in
decision...
in
matthews
v.
diaz,
it
was
even
more
stretched
than
that.
in
matthews
there
was
not
even
a
filing
with
the
court.
there
was
an
informal
notice
to
the
court
that
a...
that
an
event
had
occurred
in
the
context
where
this
court
said
that
it
was
dealing
with
an
unwaivable
jurisdictional
issue.
and
the
jurisdictional
issue...
the
complete
issue
was
that
the
person
there
had
to
apply
to
the
secretary
and
have
exhausted,
after
a
hearing,
a
particular
administrative
route.
he
hadn't
even
applied,
before
the
court
filing
occurred,
to
the
administrative
agency.
he
also
never
exhausted,
as
a
practical
matter.
but
this
court
said
that
the
informal
notice
to
the
court
that
occurred
during
the
litigation
should
be
construed
as
adequate
for
supplemental
pleading.
i'll
draw
the
attention
of
the
court
to
rule...
to
footnote
8
in
that
decision.
in
this
case,
mr.
mcneil
at
least
tried
to
let
the
court
know
that
he
had...
he
had
the
second
sum
certain
denial,
which
certainly
is
an
effective
sum
certain
denial.
it's
actually
more
than
what
the
court
had
in
matthews
v.
diaz.
i'll
also
draw
the
court's
attentions
to
the
miller
act
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
briefs,
the
u.s.
v.
c.j.
electric
and
the
haydis
decision.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
yes,
we
do.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
i
believe
it's
in
the...
it's
in
the
supplemental.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
yes,
in
the
reply
brief.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
we
think
it's
a
question
that's
a
subsidiary
question
to
the
one
that
was
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
pages
3
and
6
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
certainly
averred
to
this
question
and
make
it
clear...
we
thought
it
made
it
clear
to
the
court
that
it
was
part
of
the
question
that
was
being...
was
being
brought
to
the
court.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
august...
the
august
filing
of
1989
was
sufficient
either
as
a
complaint
itself,
as
a
stand-alone
complaint
with
the
attachments
associated
with
it,
or
as
a
perfecting
of
the
march
filing,
if
this
court
should
determine
that
the
march
filing
was
perfected.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
i
agree.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
yes,
your
honor.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
failing
to
exhaust
generates
a
particular
remedy.
the
remedy
that
the
solicitor
general's
office
is
seeking
is
dismissal,
to
treat
as
a
nullity
the
march
filing.
we
don't
believe
that
is
consistent
with
what
congress
said.
we
don't
believe
that's
consistent
with
any
of
the
congressional
history.
there
is
a
total
absence
of
any
reference
in
floor
debate
or
in
committee
reports
to
congress
of
a
suggestion
that
this
particular
remedy,
dismissal
of
the
case,
is
to
occur
if
there
is
a
premature
filing.
there
was
no
question
that
congress
intended
that
exhaustion
occur.
exhaustion
did
occur
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that
exhaustion
has
to
occur.
congress
clearly
meant
that
exhaustion
had
to--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--it's
something
that
is
certainly
necessarily
to
occur.
whether
it's
jurisdictional
or
condition
precedent
to
recovery
or
condition
precedent
to
the
case
going
forward,
i
can't...
i
can't
say.
whether
it's
a...
would
be--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--well,
matthews
v.
diaz,
i
think,
gives
a
rather
neat
answer
to
that.
and
that
answer
is
that
even
if
it's
jurisdictional,
it's
a
15(d)
supplemental
thing
relating
to
events
that
occurred
subsequent
to
the
filing.
the
case
is
now
perfected
and
under
15(d)
the
case
can
go
forward--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
yes,
it
would
have.
it
would
have.
and
i
also
want
to
mention
one
point
in
this
connection.
he
believed...
and
i
believe
this
is
incorrect,
but
he
believed
that
he
had
a
6
month
obligation
to
file
suit
after
what
he
considered
to
be
his
filing.
he
was
wrong.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
because
the
federal
tort
claims
act
proceedings,
particularly
now
with
the
administrative
proceedings,
are
proceedings
that
are
frequently
instituted
by
people
proceeding
prose.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
it
does...
it
does
not.
it
does
not
appear.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
because
the...
this
court
has
in
a
number
of
cases,
in
particular
in
relationship
to
the...
to
title
vii
in
the
zipes
case,
and
in
the...
a
dea
case,
indicated
then...
when
petitioners
proceed
prose
or
can
start
processes
prose,
that
it
will
not
strictly
construe
the
language
in
a
way
that
prevents
them
from
going
forward.
in
the
one
case,
this
court
actually
ordered
that
the
condition
of
notifying
the
state
agency,
which
had
not
been
performed,
be
performed
by
staying
the
federal
action
until
after
the
state
agency
had
an
opportunity
to
act.
in
zipes
it
found
that
the
failures
to
exhaust,
which
were
clear
on
the
record,
did
not
bar
the
case
from
going
forward.
we're
asking
for
the
same
ruling.
it
seems
to
make...
we
believe
it's
a
sensible
ruling
in
this
case.
if
congress
didn't
say
the
same
thing
as
it
said
in
the
hallstrom
context
in
the
context
of
rcra
and
environmental
statutes,
we
do
not
have
a
case
here,
like
there
where
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure,
rule
3,
the
word
"commenced"
is,
in
fact,
used.
and
congress
used
the
word
"institute".
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
we
believe
it
does,
your
honor.
we
believe
the
dictionary
definitions
are
different
and
the
common
usage
is
different.
everybody
would
understand
if
i
say
i'm
commencing
a
trip
to
the
grand
canyon.
if
i
said
i'm
instituting
a
trip
to
the
grand
canyon,
it
doesn't
mean
the
same
thing.
i
think
there's
ambiguity
there.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
congress
has,
in
fact,
used
the
word
"institute",
including
in
the
some
of
the
cases
that
the
solicitor
general...
some
of
the
statutory
examples
the
solicitor
general
cites,
which
we
refer
to
in
our
supplemental,
in
our
reply
brief...
to
mean
something
different.
to
mean,
at
least
in
some
cases,
two
different
events
as
what
is
referred
to
by
"institute".
in
one
case
at
least
the
service
of
process
is
necessary
to
finally
commence.
so
it's
not
just
a
commencement
by
filing;
"institute"
means
the
service
of
process
and
the
filing.
in
another
case
it's
the
consent
to
be--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--we
have
both
cited
dictionary
definitions
of
the
word
"institute",
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
no,
no.
the
dictionary
definitions
are
not
identical,
and
we
believe
the
common
usage
is
not
identical
either.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
and
statutes
that
congress...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
there
is
no
statutory
definition
in
this
statute
of
the
word
"institute".
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
in
a
number
of
the
examples
cited
by
the
solicitor
general's
office,
which
we
discuss
in
the
reply
brief
on
page
8
and
9,
the
word
"institute"
is
used,
in
these
cases,
in
the
same
statutory
sections
along
with
the
word
"commenced".
and
i
believe
it's
quite
clear
that
the
word
"institute"
means
something
somewhat
different
than
the
word
"commenced"
when
congress
is
using
them
in
the
same
statutes...
the
same
statutory
sections
and
subsections,
the
same
words.
in
particular,
if
you
take
a
look
at
the
section
256
that's
on
page
9,
in
that
case
"consent
to
be
included
in
the
lawsuit.
"
is
required.
and
that
consent
can
clearly
occur
at
a
later
point
in
time
than
the
initial
instituting
of
the
lawsuit,
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit,
the
commencing
of
the
lawsuit
as
a
whole,
but
it
"commences"
as
far
as
a
particular
litigant
only
when
that
litigant
agrees
to
be
part
of
the
lawsuit.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
we
believe
that
the
line
that
several
circuits
have
drawn
that
substantial
progress
had
not...
has
not
occurred
is
a
reasonable
line
to
be
drawn.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that
speaks
to
the
efforts
that
are
involved
in
the
progressing
on
behalf
of
the
government
and
the
conservation
of
the
government's
resources
in
terms
of
litigating
these
kinds
of
cases.
i
think
it's
an
appropriate
line
to
be
drawn.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
it's
certainly
reasonable
to
dismiss
it
at
that...
it's
reasonable...
no.
if
it
hasn't
progressed
at
all,
it
should
not
be
dismissed.
it's--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--well,
as
a
practical
matter,
if
congress
was
concerned
with
conserving
the
governmental
resources,
we
think
that
purpose
is
disserved
by
letting
a
case
go
forward
and
be
litigated
perhaps
months,
or
as
in
the
hallstrom
case,
years
until
the
point
happens
to
be
raised.
in
this
case,
however,
as
the
facts
of
the
case
indicate,
the
government
didn't
move
to
dismiss
until
13
months
after
the
august
filing
of
the
1989
letter.
so
no
process
occurred,
literally.
the
federal
court
didn't
find
the
filing
fee
had
been
paid
until
approximately
9
months
later
after
the
filing
of
the
august
7th
letter.
so
for
purposes
of
this
case,
we
think
it's
a
perfectly
appropriate
rule--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--if
the
government
makes
that
motion.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
we
believe
that
the
government
has
a--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--no,
at
some
point--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--at
some
point
there
may
be
an
estoppel
that
would
apply.
but
we
think
that
this
particular
whole
statutory
area
is
a
question
of
congress
waiving
its
sovereign
immunity
in
1946.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
1966
statutory
amendments
or
in
the
congressional
history,
including
the
senate
report,
to
indicate
that
it
intended
to
retract
that
waiver.
what
is
being
asked
now
is
the
adoption
of
a
special
defense
available
only
to
the
government,
for
the...
for
these
kinds
of
cases.
we
don't
think
congress
explicitly
adopted
that
special
defense,
and
we
think
it
rejected
the
idea
in
1949
of
adopting
special
defenses
for
the
government.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
believe
through
inadvertence,
there
was
a
misstatement
of
the
20
percent
and
25
percent
attorneys
fees.
it's
25
percent
if
you
go
to
court,
and
we
don't
think
the
difference
between
20
percent,
if
you
can
settle
out
of
court,
and
25
percent
is
enough
to
encourage
attorneys
to
go
ahead
and
try
to
avoid
the
administrative
process,
as
a
practical
matter.
in
this
case,
judge
ripple
quite
clearly
didn't
understand,
in
the
seventh
circuit,
that
the
august
filing
could
be
treated
as
a
separate
and
new
complaint.
this
is
not
a
new
issue
in
this
case.
that
was
the
basis
for
his
dissent.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
that's
correct.
and
we're
basically
suggesting
that
that
is
one
alternative
way
for
not
having
to
reach
the
issue
that's
involved.
we
would
also
suggest
that--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--that's
right.
because
what
you
granted
cert
on
is
also
the
case.
the
case
has
to
be
decided.
that
goes
back
to
cohens.
that's
the
obligation
of
this
court,
and
we
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
that
broader
question.
but
more
importantly--
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
--no.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
no.
mr.
allen
e.
shoenberger
i
agree,
i
agree.
but
the
obligation
is
a
different
one.
and
we
did
think
that
that
issue,
as
originally
stated,
did
include
as
a
subsidiary
issue
the
issue
that
we've
also
addressed
in
the
argument
today.
thank
you,
your
honor.
