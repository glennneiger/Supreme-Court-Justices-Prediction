mr.
william
k.
kelley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
that
the
question
in
this
case
is
resolved
by
the
language
of
section
2675(a),
which
has
received
little
attention
thus
far
this
morning.
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
that
statute
is
plain
and
it
is
unambiguous.
it
states
that
a
plaintiff
may
not
institute
an
ftca
action
unless
he
first
files
an
administrative
claim
and
that
claim
is
finally
denied
by
the
agency.
petitioner
failed
to
meet
that
condition
and
the
district
court
was
therefore
correct
to
dismiss
his
complaint.
now,
my
colleague,
mr.
shoenberger,
has
made
much
of
the
august
7th
letter
to
the
court
and
the
rule
15
he
seeks
to
make.
our
position
is
that
a
prematurely
filed
complaint
that
is
barred
by
the
terms
of
section
2675(a)
cannot
be
rescued
by
a
supplemental
pleading.
to
do
so
would
be
squarely
inconsistent
with
the
terms
of
an
act
of
congress,
something
that
rule
15
simply
cannot
authorize.
rule
15
does
not
speak
in
terms
of
permitting
an
action
to
be
filed
that
otherwise
could
not
be;
it
speaks
in
terms
of
correcting
a
defect
in
the
original
complaint.
now,
matthews
against
diaz,
which--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--we
would
have
a
problem
with
that,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
section
2675(a)
states
that
an
action
may
not
be
instituted.
and
if
one
is,
that
action
is
forever
lost.
now
if
within
the
limitations
period
a
plaintiff
tried
to
file
a
new
action,
that
would
not
be
a
problem.
but
we
don't
think
that
a
amendment
or
a
supplemental
pleading
of
an
existing
action
would
be
sufficient
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
and
i
would
also
point
out--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--yes.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
we
believe
that
would
be
insufficient,
your
honor.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
it's
merely
a
formal
matter.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well
if
as
an
administrative
matter
a
district
court
wished
to
accept
that
complaint
as
a
new
action
and
if,
further,
as
an
administrative
matter
they
retained
the
same
number,
i
suppose
nothing
would
bar
that.
i
think,
however,
that
a
new
filing
fee
would
have
to
be
paid,
or
a
new
in
forma
pauperis
motion
would
have
to
be
made.
because
section--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--august
was
not
beyond
the
limitations
period
in
this
case.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
it
was
within.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
the
administrative
denial
was
on
july
21st,
1989,
the
letter
was
sent
august
7th,
so
it
was
within
the
required
time.
but
as
i
said,
it--
mr.
william
k.
kelley
--well,
a
plaintiff
who
files
a
case
prematurely,
your
honor,
has
disserved
the
court,
in
effect,
and
used
its
resources
when
he
wasn't
entitled
to.
but
this
is
somewhat
beside
the
point.
i
would
on...
just
further
on
the
august
7th
letter,
as
i've
said,
i
don't
think
that
a
rule
15
supplemental
pleading
argument
would
work,
for
the
reason
that
it
would
be
barred
by
the
statute.
the
letter
also
cannot
be
treated
as
a
new
complaint,
we
believe,
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
terms
of
the
letter,
i
think,
are
insufficient
to
do
that.
but
more
importantly
for
this
court's
purposes,
mr.
mcneil
did
not
make
that
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and,
in
fact,
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
noted
that
he
disclaimed
that
argument.
moreover,
that
argument
simply
was
not
presented
in
the
question
presented
in
the
cert
petition
and,
in
fact,
it's
quite
inconsistent
with
the
question
that
petitioner
presented.
it
would
be
extraordinary
to
present
a
question
on
which
the
circuits
are
in
conflict,
that
is
directly
inconsistent
with
an
argument
you
wish
later
to
make,
to
get
the
court
to
grant
certiorari,
and
then
later
seek
reversal
on
that
ground.
we
don't
believe
that
that
argument
is
properly
before
the
court.
and
in
any
event,
it
is
far
afield
from
the
legal
issue
that
has
divided
the
circuits
and
on
which
we
believe
this
court's
ruling
is
necessary.
now,
also
without
much
mention
in
my
colleague's
argument
was
the
court's
decision
in
hallstrom
against
tillamook
county.
there
the
court
concluded
that
the
language
of
the
statute
at
issue
meant
what
it
said,
and
we
believe
here,
as
well,
the
court
should
enforce
the
terms
of
section
2675(a)
as
they
are
written.
and
those
terms
simply
do
not
permit
a
plaintiff
to
file
an
ftca
action
unless
he
first
complies
with
the
administrative
process
and
that
process
is
completed.
now,
the
rest
of
the
ftca
confirms
that
that
reading
is
correct.
section
2675(a)
itself
provides
exceptions
for
certain
kinds
of
pleadings.
conspicuously
absent
from
that
are
pleadings
under
rule
15(d),
and
we
believe
that
the
provision
of
some
exceptions
and
not
others
should
exclude
the
remaining
exceptions
that
petitioner
has
sought
to
have
this
court
adopt.
similarly,
the
westfall
act
amendments
in
1988
were
enacted
on
the
premise
that
section
2675(a)
requires
an
action
that
is
prematurely
filed
to
be
dismissed.
section
2679(d)(5)
deals
with
the
situation
where
the
united
states
is
substituted
as
the
defendant
in
an
action
that
is
originally
brought
against
a
government
employee.
rather
than
permitting
the
administrative
claim
process
to
be
done
away
with,
or
rather
than
having
the
action
stayed
pending
an
administrative
claim,
the
act
extends
the
statute
of
limitations
to
permit
a
plaintiff
to
file
an
administrative
claim
after
his
cause
of
action
is
dismissed,
and
later
to
file
a
new
cause
of
action.
so
we
think
the
ftca
as
a
whole
confirms
our
reading.
now,
the
court
should
also
not
overlook
the
extent
to
which
it
is
disruptive
to
the
administrative
process
to
file
a
lawsuit
prematurely
under
the
ftca.
the
administrative
process
is
very
valuable
and
very
important...
a
great
many
cases
are
settled...
and
it
would
very
much
disrupt
the
system
to
permit
plaintiffs
to
go
to
court
prematurely
and
vitiate
the
effectiveness
of
that
process.
as
the
court
stated
in
hallstrom,
positions
become
hardened
once
litigation
is
initiated,
and
settlement
becomes
less
likely.
more
practically,
ftca
cases
for
the
government
are
litigated
typically
by
the
u.s.
attorneys
offices,
and
the
administrative
claims
process
is
cut
off
by
the
filing
of
a
lawsuit.
the
statute
itself
provides
that.
section
2672
gives
the
head
of
the
concerned
agency
the
authority
to
settle
a
case
prior
to
litigation
being
filed,
subject
to
regulations
promulgated
by
the
attorney
general.
section
2677
lodges
that
authority
to
settle
in
the
attorney
general
after
a
lawsuit
is
filed.
it
is
entirely
a
separate
process.
an
agency
cannot,
on
its
own,
settle
a
case
after
a...
after
the
lawsuit
is
filed.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
well,
on...
these
facts
are
somewhat
unusual,
justice
stevens,
because
the
agency
did
not
have
notice
that
the
lawsuit
had
been
filed.
i
suppose,
as
an
abstract
matter,
that
would
be
correct,
although
the
attorney
general's
regulations
respecting
settlement
of
administrative
claims
do
not
specifically
state
that
they
may
not
settle
claims
after
a
lawsuit
is
filed.
the
structure
of
the
statute
suggests
that
and
in
the
administrative
process
the
way
it
works,
as
a
practical
matter,
is
that
once
a
case
is
filed
and
we
know...
typically,
we're
served
when
a
complaint
is
filed;
we
were
not
here...
the
agency
simply
cannot
do
it
by
itself.
but
i
don't
believe
that
we
would
be
forced
to
say
that
a
settlement
of
this
case
administratively
would
have
been
unauthorized.
i'm
not
sure
the
statute
strictly
requires
that,
and
the
regulations
do
not
either.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
i
honestly
don't
know,
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
i
don't
recall.
i
don't
believe
that
all
of
them
are,
no,
although
i
really
am
just
guessing.
so
i'll
just
say
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
k.
kelley
the
statute
is
plain.
and
we
believe,
frankly,
it
is
plain...
it
should
be
plain
to
a
layperson.
mr.
mcneil,
as
is
reflected
by
his
prose
pleadings,
is
not
someone
who
is
completely
unfamiliar
with
the
legal
system.
and
i
would
actually
have
to
say
that
he
did
a
pretty
good
job
as
a
prose
litigant
in
terms
of
his
pleadings;
he
cited
the
right
statutes,
for
example.
and
he...
he
made
a
mistake.
now,
section
2678
of
the
statute,
which
deals
with
the
extent
of
allowed
attorneys
fees
in
these
cases,
which
is
reprinted
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
also
confirms
that
there
is
a
big
difference
between
pre-litigation
settlement
and
post-litigation
settlement.
under
that
statute,
a
settlement
pursuant
to
section
2672,
that
is
the
pre-litigation
settlement
by
the
agency,
is...
allows
an
attorney
to
collect
a
contingency
fee
of
up
to
25
percent
of
the
award.
that
section
also
says,
however,
that
once
a
lawsuit
is
filed
and
a
case
is
settled
pursuant
to
section
2677,
the
percentage
of
the
allowable
attorneys
fee
is
reduced
to
20
percent,
and
that
is
a
criminal
penalty
if
a
lawyer
violates
that.
so
this
all
goes
to
the
point
that
it's
important
to
have
a
bright
line
here.
we
believe
that
it
is
important
to
know
when
a
lawsuit
may
be
instituted
and
when
one
actually
is.
petitioner
offers
no
line,
much
less
one
that
is
clear.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
submit
the
case.
