mr.
laycock,
may
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question?
there
is
a
state
law
that
touches
on
some
of
this
as
well,
is
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
has
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
interpreted
the
state
law
to
encompass
the
practices
at
issue
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
even
if
you
win
here,
presumably
the
state
law
would
be
in
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
do
we
have
any
of
the
concerns
expressed
in
renee
v.
geary,
our
case
dealing
with
redressability?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
some
of
these
ordinances
zoning
ordinances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
does
your
client
still
intend
to
perform
these
sacrifices
within
the
city
of
hialeah?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
courts
below
here
apply
a
compelling
interest
standard
in
analyzing
the
ordinances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--they
purported
to
do
so.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
specifically,
where
do
you
find
the
fault
with
the
analysis
of
the
courts
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well...
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--may
i
interrupt
you
for
a
minute?
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
possible
for
the
city
to
approach
this
problem
by
adopting
ordinances
spelling
out
the
ways
in
which
animals
may
be
killed
and
the
ways
or
requirements
for
disposition
of
any
remains,
is
that
not
right?
i
mean,
it
could
have
enacted
such
ordinances.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when
you
say
never
pursued,
did
the
city
act
on
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
there
is
no
pending
application
in
the
city
of
hialeah.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
city
of
hialeah
allow
people
in
their
homes
to
trap
mice
and
rats--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
they're
killed
in
the
process--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
to
boil
live
lobsters
and
eat
them?
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
can't
boil
the
lobster--
--you
can't
eat
lobster--
--in
hialeah.
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what's
the
exception
for
the
mice
and
rats?
where
do
i
find
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
we
were
looking
at
the
city
ordinances.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
wondered
where
i
found
the
exception.
can
you
show
me?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--are
you
referring
to
the
text
of
some
ordinance,
and
where
would
i
find
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
trapping
and
so
forth
are
not
sacrifices.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
because
what
the
city
was
trying
to
prohibit
here
was
just
the
ritual
sacrifice
as
performed
by
this
church
and
others
like
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
this
church
and
others
like
it.
