mr.
richard
g.
garrett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
record
reflects,
in
the
summer
and
the
fall
of
1987,
the
councilmen
observed
that
the
citizens
of
the
city
of
hialeah
were
concerned
over
the
potential
for
animal
sacrifices
being
conducted
in
the
city
of
hialeah.
i
think
it
is
extremely
important
that
the
factual
setting
be
clear
in
order
that
the
court
can
make
the
evaluation
of
whether
or
not
in
fact
this
religious
practice
was
targeted
or
whether
a
legitimate
governmental
purpose
was
the
subject
of
these
ordinances.
i
believe
that
important
factual
consideration
leads
to
answer
many
of
the
questions
that
are
posed
with
respect
to
the
alleged
subjective
targeting
and
the
underinclusiveness
that
is
alleged
with
regard
to
the
ordinances.
specifically,
what
hialeah
was
facing
in
the
summer
and
fall
of
1987
was
a
situation
where
tens
of
thousands
of
animals,
according
to
the
district
court
findings,
were
being
sacrificed
in
the
area
of
south
florida.
the
specific
problems
that
the
city
encountered
in
connection
with
these
sacrifices--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
your
honor,
there
are
facts
in
the
record
that
reflect
that
sacrifices
had
in
fact
been
occurring
in
hialeah,
that
dead
animals
were
being
found
in
public
places--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--within
hialeah,
that
animals
were
being,
in
effect,
tortured
in
hialeah
and
subjected
to
cruel
treatment
in
the
form
of
possession
prior
to
sacrifice.
the
problems
were
certainly
existent
in
hialeah.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
i
think
that
the
record
should
reflect
very
clearly
that
hialeah
was
responding
to
the
problem
of
ritualistic
sacrifices
taking
place
in
the
city.
what
type
of
problems
are
we
talking
about?
we're
talking
about
human
health
hazards.
the
human
health
hazard
evidence
was
evidence
concerning
the
fact
that
when
sacrifices
take
place,
that
as
many
as
52
animals
in
a
single
day
are
killed,
and
they
are
killed
in
a
private
residence
in
many
instances
and
then
they
are
decapitated,
blood
is
put
into
pots,
the
animals
are
then
oftentimes
left
out
in
public
places
if
there
is
a
ritual
that
requires
the
animal
to
be
left
in
a
public
place.
there
are
problems
connected
with
disease.
the
disease
problems
were
discussed
directly
at
the
trial
court
as
being
a
problem
associated
with
the
fact
that
the
killings
take
place
in
residences,
and
as
a
result
of
that
you
have
spilled
blood,
you
have
animal
parts
left
in
and
around
houses.
that
is
different
than
the
general
problem
of
garbage,
and--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--it
is
significantly--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--we
believe
not,
in
terms
of
effectiveness,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
the
nature
of
the
animal
sacrifice
problem
begins
all
the
way
from
the
point
in
which
the
animals
are
possessed
for
the
purposes
of
animal
sacrifice,
that
the
evidence
at
the
district
court
level
was
that
the
inhumane
treatment
to
the
animals,
which
is
one
of
the
problems
that
we
cite,
begins
at
that
point,
and
that
enforcement
is
almost
impossible
because
the
botanicas
and
other
farms
that
sell
these
animals,
you
have
a
quickly
moving
problem.
enforcement
is
very
difficult.
more
importantly,
with
respect
to
the
possession
of
the
animals
during
the
sacrifice,
there
is
no
evidence
that
you
can
solve
all
of
the
problems
in
a
house,
in
a
private
residence,
with
respect
to
a
quiltwork
of
ordinances
designed
to
regulate
everything
that
goes
on
in
that
private
residence
from
the
standpoint
of
how
many
animals
you
have
in
that
residence,
how
many...
how
they
can
be
killed,
what
you
do
with
the
blood
cauldrons,
how
you
have
to
hold
the
knife.
then
you
have
problems
associated
with
the
disposal
of
the
animals,
and
that
the
religions
oftentimes
mandate
they
be
left
in
public
places.
the
point
is
that
with
respect
to
effectively
solving
the
problems,
it
is
our
position
that,
1)
you
couldn't
solve
all
the
problems
with
a
series
of
ordinances,
and
2)
that
the
nature
of
the
kind
of
entanglement
that
you
would
be
getting
involved
in
as
a
result
of
passing
this
patchwork
of
ordinances
would
itself
cause
a
constitutionality
problem
of
entanglement
with
the
religion.
finally,
the
kind
of
ordinances
that
would
be
required
to
deal
with
this
problem
even
to
begin
approaching
effectiveness...
and
we
contend
the
city
is
not
required
constitutionally
to
enact
a
large
number
of
ordinances
which
still
don't
solve
the
problem.
but
assuming
that
you
did
enact
a
large
number
of
ordinances,
it's
our
position
that
they
would
be
back
in
court
saying
you've
in
effect
prohibited
us
from
doing
what
we
need
to
do
in
our
religion,
because
now
you
have
told
us
how
we
have
to
hold
our
knives,
how
we
have
to
kill
them,
how
we
have
to
handle
the
blood
in
the
particular
ceremonies,
and
how
we
have
to
dispose
of
the
animals,
and
our
gods
say
that's
not
what
we
can
do,
and
therefore
we
would
have
the
same
problem.
we'd
be
back
here
with
a
different
type
of
argument,
but
with
the
same
kind
of
argument
that
the
regulatory
framework
that
we
had
created
effectively
precluded
them
from
practicing
their
religion,
and
that
is
the
problem
that
the
city
was
facing.
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
these--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--well,
our
ordinances,
your
honor,
are
not
directed
at
religion,
they
are
directed
at
the
practice
of
animal
sacrifice.
they
are
specifically
directed
at
the
conduct.
now,
a
lot
of
argument
has
been
made
in
the
neutrality
area
here,
that
really
by
targeting
animal
sacrifice
we
are
targeting
the
religions
that
do
those
animal
sacrifices.
that
is
not
in
our
opinion
a
proper
analysis
of
the
situation,
because
our
legitimate
problem
was
animal
sacrifices.
our
legitimate
problem
the
record
doesn't
reflect
was
hunting,
it
isn't
euthanasia,
it's
not
pest
control,
it
is
the
problem
with
animal
sacrifice,
all
the
way
from
the
beginning
of
the
process
and
the
damage
to
the
animals
to
the
end
of
the
process
and
the
disposal
of
the
remains.
so
we
addressed
what
our
problem
was,
we
didn't
address
what
other
kinds
of
problems
may
exist,
and
we're
not
required--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--your
honor,
there
are
two
responses
to
that:
1)
this
is
not
only
a
religious
practice.
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
which
has
not
been
mentioned
that
groups
engage
in
this
activity...
malevolent
magic
is
mentioned
by
one
of
their
witnesses
to
describe
what
existed
with
respect
to
a
goat
that
was
cut
in
half
and
found
on
miami
beach.
there
are
also...
there's
also
evidence
in
the
record
with
respect
to
the
fact
that
this
particular
type
of
practice
is
engaged
in
by
satanists,
by
witchcraft,
voodoo,
and
this
court
has
never
gone
so
far
as
to
particularly
extend
protection
to
those
groups.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
we
believe
that
there
are
two
ways,
certainly,
to
reach
the
result
of
the
district
court.
the
first
way
is
the
come
to
the
conclusion
that
we
really
do
have
a
neutrality
in
terms
of
meeting
the
neutrality
standard
of
smith,
because
we
are
not
underinclusive.
we
dealt
with
our
particular
governmental
problem.
we
didn't
have
any
record
of
evidence
of
any
problems
of
hunting,
any
problems
of
euthanasia,
and
therefore
we
meet
the
neutrality
standard.
but
i
think
that
there's
a
second
separate
ground
that
doesn't
even
require
a
smith
analysis
and
conclusion
of
neutrality,
which
is
simply
that
we
had
substantial
compelling
governmental
interests
that
justified
the
particular
ordinances
at
hand,
and
we
mentioned
at
the
trial
court
and
we
argued
that
the
human
health
hazards
are
substantial.
the
human
health
hazards,
which
i
want
to
get
back
to
a
for
a
moment...
when
you
talk
about
killing
of
large
numbers
of
animals,
and
blood
and
goat
heads
being
present
in
a
community
where
people
live,
in
residence
areas,
you
are
dealing,
according
to
the
expert
testimony,
with
a
problem
of
creating
vectors
for
disease.
these
vectors
come
about
because
in
an
area
where
you
have
animal
parts
or
blood
in
residential
areas,
you
create
harborages
for
rats,
who
generally
like
to
travel
only
within
150
feet
of
their
particular
food
supplies.
then
you
have
the
possibility
of
the
fleas,
the
flies
transmitting
the
diseases.
now,
the
diseases
don't
come
from
the
animals
in
particular.
they
may
come
from
other
animals
that
feed
on
them
that
are
diseased.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
there
is
not
an
exception
in
the
city
ordinances
of
hialeah
that
would
permit
an
individual
to
slaughter
his
own
animals
for
any
reason
in
his
house.
the
ordinances
cannot
be
read
as
permitting
any
individual
killing
of
animals
in
the
city
of
hialeah
by
a
resident,
and
so--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--there
is
a
situation
in
hialeah
where
you
may,
for
the
purposes
of--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--yes,
that
would
be
permitted
in
the
city
of
hialeah,
but
we
believe
that
it
would
be
permitted
by
an
establishment
that
is
qualified
to
do
that.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
no,
that
would
certainly
be
cruel.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
that
would
be
a
cruel
killing.
that
would
certainly
not
be
permitted
under
the
ordinance.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
it's
forbidden.
it's
clearly
forbidden
under
87-40.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
in
that
situation
it
would
be
a
permitted...
it
would
be
a
permitted
killing,
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
because
the
sanitary
problem
that
we
have
identified
is
one
that
is
unique
to
animal
parts
in
public
places
growing
out
of
sacrifice.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
because
if
you
prohibit
the
sacrifice,
because
you
are
in
a
position
to
stop
it
at
a
point
when
the
animals
are
possessed,
because
you
also
have
a
possession
statute
and
you
have
animals
lined
up
going
into
a
residence,
you
in
effect
preclude
the
problem
from
developing.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
because
our
view
is
that
there
are
indications
of
when
an
animal
sacrifice
is
about
to
take
place
in
a
house.
there
are
large
numbers
of
people,
there
are
animals
outside,
and
it
is
the
view
that
we
would
be
able
to
stop
that.
on
the
other
hand,
with
respect
to
the
placement
of
individual
animals
throughout
the
community,
that
doesn't
nearly
create
the
level
of
conduct
or
problem
that
would
be
perceived
by
the
governmental
authorities
from
an
enforcement
point
of
view.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
the
district
court
made
some
very
specific
findings
about
how
overwhelming
the
sacrifice
process
can
become
in
terms
of
large
numbers
of
animals
being
sacrificed
in
one
initiation
ceremony
in
a
very
small
house
in
hialeah
with
a
6
x
10
kitchen,
and
the
district
court
judge
marveled
how
this
could
all
be
done
in
a
sanitary
condition
under
circumstances
where
the
animals
were
cared
for
properly
under
circumstances
where
the
killing
was--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--it
can
be
inspected,
it
can
be
regulated--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--the
method
of
killing
can
be
monitored--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--i
think
there
is
an
open
question
with
respect
to
the
ordinance
87-72,
under
circumstances
where
all
of
the
other
problems
associated
with
animal
sacrifice
were
alleviated...
and
when
i'm
talking
about
that,
the
cruelty
to
the
animals,
the
situation
of
the
method
of
slaughter,
whether
it
is
humane
or
not...
which
could
permit
the
animal
slaughtering
where
the
food
is
consumed,
under
87-72,
in
an
area
that
was
properly
zoned
for
slaughterhouses,
and
i
think
that
that
is
something
that
the
petitioners
have
never
pursued.
the
record
reflects
that
on
the
eve
of
trial
of
this
case
the
petitioners
made
an
application
for
the
purpose
of
being
able
to
conduct
animal
sacrifice
as
a
slaughterhouse
in
the
location
of
the
church,
and
that
was
never
pursued.
there
is
also
quoted
in
the--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--the...
it
was
in
effect
withdrawn.
it
was
not
pursued.
it
was
immediately
on
the
verge
of
trial.
there
was
no
action.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
as
we
understand
at
this
point
there
is
no
pending
application
at
the
city
of
hialeah.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
yes.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
there
is
clearly
a
prohibition
in
the
ordinances
about
the
boiling
of
lobsters,
if
you
read
the
ordinances
as
saying,
as
i
think
they
do...
or
any
other
animals,
so
i
don't
believe
that
the
lobsters--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--i
think
that
technically...
a
technical
reading
of
the
ordinance
would
say
that
the
boiling
of
lobsters
is
claused
by,
other
animals.
in
your
house,
i
think
there
is
an
exception--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--the
exception
for
the
mice
and
rats
would
be
in
the
state
statute
with
respect
to
ordinances.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
yes,
and
there
are--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--i
believe
i
can.
i
believe
that
the
exception
is
that
it
would
not
fall
within
a
sacrifice--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--well--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--yes.
i
think
that
none
of
the
ordinances
would
define
it
as
a
sacrifice.
i
believe
that
it
is
not
being
killed
for
food,
and
therefore
it
would
not
be
covered
under
the
particular
ordinances.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
no,
i
think
that
what
the
effort
was
here
was...
and
we
make...
we
don't
try
and
argue
against
this.
we
were
trying
to
prevent
animal
sacrifices.
the
question--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--not
only
churches,
by
any
person,
by
any
religion,
by
any
cult,
by
any
secular
act--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--i
believe
that
there
are
no
slaughterhouses
at
this
point
in
the
city
of
hialeah.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
in
that
situation,
i
believe
that
there
would
under
the
rulings
of
this
court
probably
have
to
be
either
a
saturday
or
sunday
available
in
order
to
conduct
the
rituals
in
those
particular
slaughterhouses.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
i
think
that
they
would
be.
yes,
i
do.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
no,
i
believe
that
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to,
in
a
situation
where
you
have
a
circumstance
where
you
are
allowing
some
religious
practices
to
occur
in
a
slaughterhouse,
that
you
would
have
to
allow
them
to
occur
on
a
saturday
or
a
sunday.
[laughter]
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
no,
we
do
not
believe
that
a
church
would
have
a
right
to
engage
in
animal
sacrifice
under
circumstances
that
you
have
now
described.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
because
we
believe
that
the
constitution
does
not
allow
all
religious
practices
to
be
engaged
in
even
if
they
are
central
to
the
religion.
the
reynolds
case
made
it
very
clear
that
even
though
polygamy
was
central
to
the
mormon
church,
that
laws
basically
outlawing
the
polygamists
activities
were
laws
that
were
constitutional.
we
would
submit
that
the
fact
that
it
is
important
to
a
religion,
if
there
is
a
legitimate
governmental
purpose
to
the
particular
restrictions--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--we
submit
that
it
is.
we
submit
that
animal
sacrifice
is
an
appropriate
category
to
be
specifically
focused
on
by
a
series
of--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--i
think
it
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
ordinances
that
they
in
effect
attempt
to
preclude
animal
sacrifice,
and
they
do
that
in
a
number
of
different
ways,
and
i
think
that
is
the
question
that
the
court
is
facing,
whether
or
not
the
attempt,
and
in
this
case
a
successful
attempt
to
preclude
the
animal
sacrifice
as
a
governmental
problem,
is
one
that
can
be
done
under
the
first
amendment,
free
exercise
provision.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
i
believe
that
the
question
becomes
what
particular
problems
the
municipality
is
facing,
and
if
the
municipality
has
to
go
and
deal
with
the
hypothetical
problems
in
the
scope
of
the
ordinance
that
are
not
really
facing
the
community,
i
don't
see
why
that
is
constitutionally
mandated.
it
would
seem
that
if
the
problems
that
we
have
been
able
to
identify
are
problems
that
grow
specifically
out
of
animal
sacrifice,
that
it
is
not
required
that
the
city,
for
example,
exempt
hunting
or
any
other
particular
type
of
problem
or
deal
with
them
in
the
ordinances.
it's
clear
that
animal
sacrifice
carries
with
it
very
specific
problems
that
are
not
attendant
with
the
other
types
of
exceptions
that
the
petitioners
point
to.
there
is
no
record
evidence
that
we
have
any
of
those
particular
problems,
and
i
think
that
it's
a
question
of
the
classification.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
that's
correct.
that
would
be
an
incidental
impact
of
the
ordinance,
and
we
believe
that
that
would
be
constitutional
under
smith.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
well,
i
don't
believe
by
giving
you
that
one
example,
which
was
provided
to
you
to
show--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--no,
that
is
not
true
at
all.
there
are
numbers
of
animals--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--that
are
testified
to
as
having
been
placed
throughout
the
community.
the
testimony
is
replete
with
evidence
of
dead
animals
being
left
in
sewell
park,
being
left
throughout
the
community.
there
are
pictures,
photographic
pictures
of
animals--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--certainly,
but
they
were
ineffective.
they
were
obviously
not
accomplishing
the
purpose
for
which
they
were
enacted,
because
it's
very
difficult
to
police
a
situation
where
people
go
out
at
night
time
or
early
in
the
morning
with
whole
animals
and
leave
them
in
parks,
leave
them
under
palm
trees
as
it's
dictated
under
the
religious
tenets,
leave
them
at
railroad
crossings,
leave
them
at
the
steps
of
courthouses
in
some
instances...
all
of
these
dispersal
of
animal
problems
are
problems
that
are
in
the
record,
and
they
are
not
simply
a
single
goat.
that
is
not--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--i
do
not
reject
the
possibility
that
under
87-72,
under
circumstances
where
there
was
an
area
zoned
for
slaughterhouses
or
an
application
was
made
for
a
change
in
the
zoning
plan
and
the
animals
were
in
fact
consumed,
that
there
would
be
a
situation
where
constitutionally
and
under
the
laws
of
the
city,
that
would
be
permitted.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
currently--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--the
way
the
ordinances
are
drafted
now,
sacrifice
would
not
be
permitted
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
it
is
our
position
that
that
is
constitutional.
your
honors,
the
circumstance
that
the
city
of
hialeah
was
facing
was
a
very
specific
circumstance...
animal
sacrifice,
inhumane
treatment
to
animals.
i
would
point
out
that
when
we
talk
about
putting
this
activity
into
a
slaughterhouse
we
are
not
solving
the
claim
of
petitioners
that
they
are
entitled
to
practice
their
religion
as
they
wish,
and
the
reason
why
we
are
not
solving
that
problem
is
because
we
never
got
to
the
manner
in
which
the
sacrifices
occur.
this
is
not
ritualistic
slaughter
as
it
occurs
in
kosher
slaughter,
for
example.
this
is
an
indifferent
type
of
killing.
the
district
court
judge
was
able
to
conclude
that
this
was
an
inhumane
type
of
killing
because
he
understood
that
in...
for
example,
with
respect
to
a
four-legged
animal
an
individual
hoists
it,
puts
it
on
a
table
or
altar,
attempts
to
hold
it
down
with
one
hand,
raises
a
knife
in
the
right
hand
and
attempts
in
a
jabbing
motion
to
cut
the
carotid
arteries
in
an
unreliable
method
of
killing.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
his
position
was
that
state
law--
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
--his
position
was
that
state
did
not
go
far
enough
in
being
humane.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
that
was
his
position,
and
he's
not
a
lawyer,
and
he
wasn't
rejecting
it
legally.
his
view
was
that
that
type
of
killing
was
not
as
humane
as
he
would
like
it
to
be.
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
this
type
of
killing
was
so
unreliable,
according
to
dr.
fox,
that
you
couldn't
be
in
any
way
assured
that
both
carotid
arteries
would
be
cut,
the
animal,
in
effect,
would
remain
conscious
for
a
period
of
time,
and
it
wouldn't
be
apparent
that
you
hadn't
cut
the
carotid
arteries
because
of
the
blood,
and
so
we're
talking
about
altering
the
manner
in
which
they
actually
kill
the
animals.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
it
is
permitted,
but
the
method
of
humane
slaughter
is
not
altered
by
that
exception.
humane
slaughter
must
still
be
practiced
in
killing
the
animals,
and
so
simply
moving
this
religion
into
a
slaughterhouse
doesn't
solve
the
problems
of
meeting
the
humane
slaughter
standards.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
i
believe
that
the
petitioner's
claim
that
they
are
entitled
to
slaughter
the
animals
according
to
their
religious
dictates,
and
that
that
would
not
be
subject
to
the
regulation
that
we
propose
and
that
the
state
proposes
with
respect
to
humane
slaughter.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
yes,
it
is
our
position
that
it
would.
mr.
richard
g.
garrett
to
my
knowledge
there
have
been
no
prosecutions
either
at
the
state
or
at
the
local
level.
