mr.
laycock,
what
do
you
rely
on
for
the
threat
of
prosecution
from
the
city?
it's
just
the
prologue,
or
have
there
been
other
threats
of
prosecution?
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
there...
i'm
sure
there
are
a
lot
of
statutes,
local,
state
and
federal,
that
use
the
term
unnecessary.
do
you
mean
whenever
somebody
says
that
god
tells
him
it
is
necessary,
that
statute
is
invalid
as
applied
to
that
person?
that
can't
be
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can't
make
any
exceptions
to
it.
once
they
make
any
exception
at
all,
it's
no
longer
a
law
of
general
applicability.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean,
you
couldn't
say
you
may
kill
animals
for
food
but
not
for
other
purposes...
not
for
sport,
not
for
sacrifice,
not
for
anything
but
food.
you
couldn't
even
make
that
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
an
animal
in
self...
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
but
it
may
not
be
targeting
the
unpopular
religion,
it
may
be
targeting
the
unpopular
act,
which
may
be
an
act
that
happens
to
be
practiced
only
by
the
religion.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
you've
acknowledged
that
the
act
becomes
different
depending
upon
what
its
purpose
is,
that
you'll
allow
it
in
self
defense,
you
might
allow
it
for
food,
but
you
might
not
want
to
allow
it
for
other
purposes.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
different
act
depending
on
what
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--take,
for
example,
united
states
v.
reynolds,
which
was
the
case
in
which
we
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
a
law
prohibiting
bigamy
in
the
territory
of
the
united
states.
suppose
that...
in
fact,
the
only...
there
was
no
problem
with
bigamy,
that
the
only
reason
the
law
was
enacted
was
because
there
was
a
single...
a
single
religious
group
that
practiced
it.
would
that
law
therefore,
since
the
only
people
who
do
that
act
happen
to
do
it
for
religious
reasons,
is
that
law
invalid?
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
hinges
on
your
saying...
or
ignoring,
i
think,
the
definition
of
sacrifice
though,
doesn't
it,
because
the
definition
of
sacrifice
includes
any
ritualistic
killing
which
would
include
a
killing
by
a
fraternity
group.
now,
you
may
say
well,
there
aren't
any
fraternity
groups,
but
that
just
brings
you
back
to
the
problem
in
reynolds.
there
may
not
have
been
anybody
else
practicing
bigamy,
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
family
of
religions,
or
the
practice
of
sacrifice.
i
mean,
was
there
a
finding
that
there
was
an
antagonism
towards
santeria?
was
there
any
attempt
to
suppress
the
religion
as
such?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
true,
but
you
know,--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there
have
been
people
like
the
thugs
were
a
religious
group,
i
believe,
and
their
central
ritual
was
killing
other
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
surely
that
can
be
suppressed.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
hialeah
says
they
have
a
universal,
generally
applicable
law
against
ritualistic
killing
of
animals.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no.
anybody
who
wants
to
have
a
ritual
and...
you're
quite
right,
it
doesn't
happen
very
often
in
fraternities,
though
i
imagine
it
happens
now
and
then.
but
why
isn't
that
a
valid
argument,
that...
they
don't
care
whether
you're
doing
it
for
religious
reasons
or
not.
they
really
don't
care
what
your
reason
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
must
ban
all
killing
of
animals
or
else
no
killing
of
animals
because
the
purpose
can't
be
taken
into
account,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
you
could
at
least
allow
self
defense.
that's
a
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
close
at
all.
i
think
it's
obvious
you
can
say...
i
think
it's
obvious
you're
allowed
to
allow
the
killing
of
animals
in
self
defense,
and
that
doesn't
mean
you
have
to
allow
all
other--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
purpose
makes
a
difference,
so
you
can
take
purpose
into
account.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
maybe
you
have
to.
that's
what
it...
maybe
what
a
generally
applicable
law
means.
you
don't
address
the
problems
of
hunters
who
kill
animals
cruelly,
or
dispose
of
their
carcasses
in
a
manner
that
you
don't
approve
of
or
that's
unsanitary,
but
you
do
pick
upon
this
religious
practice.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
let
householders
who
have
animals
slaughter...
there
is
an
exception
made
for
slaughter
of
a
small
number,
outside
of
a
slaughterhouse,
of
a
small
number
of
pigs
and
such.
isn't
there
an
exception
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
allow
that.
i
mean,
you
don't
allow
that
no
matter
how
sanitary,
no
matter
how
easy
it
is
rendered
for
you
to
police
it.
there
is
not
even
exception...
you
make
an
exception
for
slaughterhouses.
you
can
have
a
licensed
slaughterhouse
where
killing
may
occur,
because
i
guess
it
can
be
inspected
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you're
talking
about
sacrificial
killing,
you
don't
even
allow
it
to
be
done
at
a
place...
a
temple,
a
church,
whatever...
where
they
say,
come
in
and
inspect.
do
you
want
to
come
in
and
inspect?
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
allow
it
to
be
done
nowhere,
no
matter
how
easy
it
is
for
you
to
police,
no
matter
how
willing
they
are
to
have
you
inspect
it.
you
just
say,
no
sacrifice.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
would
you
not
agree
that
in
order
for
the
prohibition
to
be
legitimate,
the
public
values
that
you
assert
are
being
furthered
by
the
prohibition
must
not
be
allowed
to
be
compromised
through
other
exceptions
to
the
killing
that
you
allow,
because
otherwise
you
would
have
nothing
left
but
an
antagonism
towards
the
religion.
you
do
not
like
sacrifice
to
be
done.
if
you
have
other
values...
cruelty
to
animals
or
public
sanitation
or
whatever
else...
at
least
the
other
exceptions
that
you
make
from
your
general
prohibition
cannot
permit
those
things
to
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
want
to
consume
them.
they
just
want
to
sacrifice.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
agree,
mr.
laycock,
that
the
limited
slaughter
that
is
allowed
can
only
be
allowed
in
a
slaughterhouse?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
why
shouldn't
you
be
able
to
slaughter
any
way
you
want...
humane
or
inhumane?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
theory
of
your
case
is
correct,
why...
you
know,
why
not
go
all
the
way?
