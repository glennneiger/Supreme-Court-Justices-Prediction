justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
laycock,
if
you
were
attacking
solely
the
state
statute
and
you
were
doing
so
following
an
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
that
a
sacrifice
was
unnecessary,
what
would
your
argument
be
consistent
with
smith?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
effect
you're
saving
you've
got
to
define
the
act
without
reference
to
the
intention
of
the
people
who
perform
the
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
their
failure
to
preclude
broadly
enough,
is
it
the
underinclusiveness
of
it
which
precludes
the
finding
of
a
compelling
state
interest?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
it's
underinclusive
with
a
purpose.
ah,
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
let's
go
back
to
your
reason
for
not
targeting
the
unsanitary
practice
rather
than
targeting
the
religious
practice
that
you
say
ultimately
leads
to
it.
why
are
you
likely
to
be
more
effective
in
targeting
a
religious
practice
so
defined
than
you
are
in
targeting
an
unsanitary
practice
defined
as
such?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
sacrifice
is
unique
to
private
practices
in
private
houses,
and
i
don't
see
how
you
are
likely
to
be
very
effective
in
reaching
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
know
you
do
if
you
can
do
it,
but
i
guess
my
question
is,
why
are
you
likely
to
be
more
effective
in
preventing
the
practice
within
the
private
house
than
you
are
to
be
in
preventing
the
disposal
in
a
public
place?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
the
district
court
make
findings
on
these
indicia
of
approaching
sacrifice?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
an
easier
way
to
police
them
would
be
to
go
back
to
the
example
that
justice
kennedy
was
working
you
towards
to
provide
some
regulated
place
like
a
slaughterhouse
in
which
the...
kind
of
the
core
practice
could
occur,
and
yet
you
reject
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
you
still
maintain
that
they
may
define
the
practice...
the
prohibited
practice
merely
as
sacrifice,
regardless
of
where
it
might
take
place
and
under
what
regulated
conditions,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it's
your
position
that
that
is
perfectly
constitutional.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
also
the
case
that
that
same
witness
rejected
the
state
law
definition
of
humane
killing?
in
other
words,
he
wishes
to
impose
a
different
standard
from
that
which
state
law
imposes,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
