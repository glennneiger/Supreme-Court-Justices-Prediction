justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
the
attack
on
the
state
law
be
somewhat
more
difficult
for
you
to
sustain
than
the
attack
on
the
local
ordinance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
mr.
laycock,
in
your
view
as
you
read
smith,
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
neutrality
requirement?
is
it
an
end
in
itself?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
have
a
neutrality
standard
that
we
administer.
what
is
the
purpose
of
that
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
is
the
ultimate
end.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
don't
have
a
further
reason
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
are
concerned
with--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--prohibiting
legislatures--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--from
acting
with
hostility
to
religion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
take
it
the
underlying
purpose
for
that
is
to
avoid
a
regime
which
is
hostile
to
religion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then
the
ultimate...
our
ultimate
inquiry,
our
ultimate
purpose,
is
to
avoid
a
particular
subjective
motivation
on
the
part
of
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
might
be
simply
an
objective
mechanism--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--for
probing
the
existence
of
the
forbidden
intent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
they
both
are
probative
of
the
forbidden
purpose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
talked
earlier
about
the
slaughterhouse
possibility.
suppose
there
is
an
area
that's
zoned
for
a
slaughterhouse
and
it
is
a
slaughterhouse,
can
it
be
used
on
saturdays
and
sundays
for
animal
sacrifices?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
want...
i
have
a
hypothetical
city
and
a
hypothetical
slaughterhouse.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
is
to
say
that
the
sacrificial
rites
that
are
conducted
in
a
slaughterhouse
are
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
to
sacrifice
animals.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
if
a
church
finds
a
slaughterhouse
that
is
properly
zoned
and
if
it
follows
standards
of
applicability
that
are
general
for
the
disposal
of
animals,
does
it
have
a
constitutional
right
to
engage
in
its
sacrificial
services?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then
is
the
legitimate
governmental
purpose
here
the
prohibition
of
sacrifice,
per
se?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
it
a
fair
reading
of
these
ordinances
to
find
that
that
policy
is
implicit
in
these
ordinances?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
as
i
understand
it,
there's
an
exemption
in
the
statute
so
that
there's
killing
for
food,
and
if
it's
less
than,
i
think,
35
lambs
a
week
or
20
cattle,
something
like
that,
it's
permitted.
