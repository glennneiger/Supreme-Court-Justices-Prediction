mr.
douglas
laycock
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
open
discrimination
against
a
minority
religion.
the
four
ordinances
challenged
here
were
enacted
in
direct
response
to
the
church's
announcement
that
it
would
build
a
church
and
practice
in
public.
they
were
enacted
for
the
express
purpose
of
preventing
the
central
rituals
of
this
faith.
that
purpose
is
recited
in
the
preambles
to
the
ordinances
and
in
the
accompanying
resolutions.
the
preambles
say
that
the
city's--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--it
is
not
recited
in
all
four
of
them,
no,
justice
white.
it
is
recited
in
two
of
the
preambles
and
in
one
of
the
resolutions.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
we
do
need--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--it
is
possible
in
theory,
yes.
mr.
douglas
laycock
all
four
ordinances
have
merged
from
the
same
pattern
of
legislation.
i
think
they
all
share
the
intent,
but
the
intent
is
recited
principally
in
87-52
and
87-71.
the
accompanying
resolution
that
goes
with
the
ordinance
recites
that
the
target
is
certain
religions
and
certain
acts
of
any
and
all
religious
groups.
the
ordinances
are
written
in
religious
terminology.
they
do
not
forbid
killing,
they
forbid
sacrifice,
and
indeed,
these
ordinances
do
not
forbid
any
physical
act
as
such.
all
the
prohibitions
depend
in
part
upon
an
analysis
of
the
purposes
or
motives
of
the
actor,
and
when
the
analysis
is
complete,
the
religious
motive
is
always
forbidden.
but
i
think
what
is
most
revealing
about
these
ordinances
is
that
they
are
written
on
the
assumption
that
animal
sacrifice
is
unnecessary.
the
city's
brief
says
it's
unnecessary,
the
state
attorney
general's
opinion
says
it's
unnecessary,
all
of
the
city's
amici
say
it
is
unnecessary,
and
lack
of
necessity
is
an
element
of
the
offense
in
three
of
the
four
ordinances.
mr.
douglas
laycock
there
is
a
state
law
that
is
incorporated
into
one
of
the
ordinances.
the
state
law
is
not
challenged
in
this
case.
i
think--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--yes.
the
state...
the
sequence
was,
was
the
hialeah
city
council
enacted
ordinance
87-40,
which
incorporates
the
state
statute,
and
then
the
city
requested
of
the
attorney
general
an
opinion
as
to
whether
the
state
statute
that
had
thus
been
incorporated
applied
to
animal
sacrifice,
and
he
responded
that
it
did
apply
because
sacrifice
is
unnecessary.
mr.
douglas
laycock
whether
the
state
law
remains
in
effect,
the
state
is
not
a
party.
there
was
no
ripe
threat
of
prosecution
from
the
state.
there
was
a
ripe
threat
from
the
city.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i'm
not
familiar
with
renee,
but
i
am
familiar
with
the
redressability
issue.
this
lawsuit
can
resolve
all
of
the
ripe
threats
of
prosecution
and
entirely
redress
that
injury.
the
state
may
or
may
not
at
some
point
in
the
future
attempt
to
enforce
the
state
law.
it
has
not
yet
done
so.
there
are
a
variety
of
other
general
statutes
that
the
city
may
at
some
point
construe
to
apply
against
us.
none
of
those
controversies
are
ripe
either.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
the
state
law
is
not
neutral
on
its
face
as
applied
to
this
practice,
but
you're
right,
justice
white,
that
the
history
of
the
state
law
is
very
different.
that
would
be
a
different
case,
but
an
attempt
to
enforce
the
state--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--no.
if
we
were
attacking
the
state
law,
i
would
be
arguing
that
the
theory,
the
legal
theory
of
the
attorney
general
to
make
the
state
law
applicable
targeted
religion.
the
statute
as
a
whole
has
many
secular
applications,
but
the
theory
by
which
it
might
apply
to
us
is
a
theory
that
violates
the
first
amendment
and
is
specifically
targeted
at
religion.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
think
that
if
the
ordinances
are
struck
down,
the
stare
decisis
effect
will
pretty
much
take
care
of
us
on
the
state
statute,
but
the
history,
the
way
in
which
the
ordinances
were
enacted,
is
unique
to
the
ordinances
and
does
not
apply
to
the
statute.
the--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--well,
the
finding
of
fact
is
that
the
city
firmly
intended
to
prevent
all
animal
sacrifice
in
the
city,
the
city
adopted
resclutions
reciting
that
intention,
the
entire
legislative
package
was
targeted
at
my
clients.
the
threat
of
prosecution
seemed
quite
real,
and
then
they
have
complied
for
5
years
as
a
result
of
that
threat
of
prosecution.
mr.
douglas
laycock
no,
none
of
them
are
zoning
ordinances,
and
zoning
is
a
red
herring
in
the
case.
some
of
the
ordinances
say
that
with
proper
zoning
you
can
have
a
commercial
food
business
or
a
commercial
slaughterhouse,
but
none
of
the
ordinances
say
or
even
imply
that
with
proper
zoning
you
could
sacrifice.
sacrifice
is
absolutely
forbidden.
so
there
are
farms
within
the
city
limits
with
proper
zoning.
you
can
slaughter
hogs
and
cattle
with
proper
zoning.
slaughterhouses
turn
out
millions
of
pounds
of
meat
per
day,
and
in
theory,
although
not
in
fact,
they
could
be
zoned
into
hialeah,
but
sacrifice
will
remain
absolutely
forbidden
by
these
ordinances
even
with
those...
even
with
slaughterhouse
zoning.
mr.
douglas
laycock
yes,
he
does.
mr.
douglas
laycock
the
ordinance
defines
sacrifice
as
the
unnecessary
killing
of
an
animal
in
a
ritual
or
ceremony
not
for
the
primary
purpose
of
food
consumption.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
smith
says
that
religious
acts
are
subject
to
neutral
and
generally
applicable
regulation,
but
smith
also
reaffirms
the
long
line
of
cases
that
says
government
cannot
resolve
religious
controversies.
government
cannot
decide
whether
sacrifice
is
necessary
or
unnecessary.
an
element
of
the
offense
under
the
state
law
is
that
the
killing
of
the
animal
be
unnecessary.
that's
also
an
element
under
three
of
the
four
ordinances.
the
only
way
to
prove
that
sacrifice
is
unnecessary
is
to
prove
that
santeria
is
a
false
religion.
to
believers
in
santeria,
sacrifice
is
directly
commanded
by
the
gods
in
considerable
detail
on
each
occasion
when
it
is
required.
to
prove
it
unnecessary,
you
must
prove
the
religion
false,
and
when
the
prosecutor
has
to
prove
a
religion
false,
the
prosecutor
is
engaged
in
a
heresy
trial.
mr.
douglas
laycock
the
prohibition
has
to
depend
upon
something
other
than
the
lack
of
necessity,
justice
scalia.
if
hialeah
had
a
generally
applicable
prohibition
on
killing
animals,
if
it
said
no
one
may
kill
an
animal
in
the
city
of
hialeah,
the
religious
necessity
would
be
irrelevant
under
this
court's
decision
in
smith,
but
hialeah
doesn't
have
anything
like
that.
hialeah
says,
you
can
kill
animals
for
a
whole
range
of
reasons
that
we
the
city
consider
necessary,
but
not
for
this
religious
reason
that
we
the
city
consider
unnecessary.
so
the
necessity
element
is
applied
directly
to
the
theological
question,
and
that
is
forbidden,
i
think,
by
the
most
central
principal
of
the
first
amendment
and
reaffirmed
in
employment
division
v.
smith.
it's
also
important
that
none
of
these
ordinances
interfere
with
any
of
the
routine
killings
of
animals
that
the
citizens
of
hialeah
depend
upon
every
day.
the
city
tells
us
that
all
of
those
killings
are
not
only
necessary,
they're
important.
bow
and
arrow
hunting
is
very
important.
getting
rid
of
surplus
pets
is
important.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
there
is
bow
and
arrow
hunting
by
citizens
of
hialeah
who
bring
their
kill,
bring
the
entire
carcass
back
to
the
city.
there
are
farms
in
the
city
of
hialeah.
there
are
veterinary
offices
that
kill
animals
in
hialeah.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
disagree,
mr.
chief
justice.
when
the
first
step
is
the
first
amendment,
they
can't
deal
with
that
one
step
at
a
time.
they
have
to
deal
with
constitutionally
protected
activities
in
a
generally
applicable
way.
they
can
distinguish
bow
hunting
from
killing
surplus
pets
one
step
at
a
time,
but
they
can't
say
our
one
and
only
step
is
to
suppress
this
religion
and
distinguish
that
from
all
of
the
secular
killings
of
animals
that
they
permit.
mr.
douglas
laycock
but
the
reason
they
think
it's
the
only
evil
is
that
they
disapprove
the
religion.
mr.
douglas
laycock
they
have
not
said
that
none
of
those
things
go
on--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--and
the
record
does
not
show
that
none
of
those
things
go
on.
mr.
douglas
laycock
okay.
then...
yeah,
if
no
other
killings
of
animals
are
going
on
in
the
city
of
hialeah,
then
their
solution
under
smith
would
be
to
draft
an
ordinance
that
simply
says,
it
is
illegal
to
kill
an
animal
in
the
city
of
hialeah.
that
would
be
unfortunate
for
my
clients,
but
under
smith
that
would
be
a
neutral
and
generally
applicable
law.
and
then--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--i'm
inclined
to
think
they
can't
make
any
exceptions,
but
this
case
doesn't
get
us
anywhere
close
to
that
question.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
can
imagine
an
exception
you'd
kill
an
animal
in
self
defense
if
you're
being
attacked
by
a
bear.
mr.
douglas
laycock
right,
okay.
i
can
imagine
very
narrow
exceptions,
but
what
they
cannot
do
is
create
broad
exceptions
that
eliminate
the
political
resistance
to
the
law
and
enable
them
merely
to
target
the
unpopular
religion.
they
have
to
treat...
as
i
read
your
opinion
in
smith,
they
have
to
treat
religion
at
least
as
well
as
they
treat
favored
secular
activities.
mr.
douglas
laycock
the
act
is
not
different.
the
animal
is
equally
dead
whether
killed
in
a
ritual
or
ceremony
or
killed
otherwise.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i...
i--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--i
do
not
believe
they
can
allow
animals
to
be
killed
for
food
without
a
ricual
or
ceremony
and
forbid
these
sacrifices
where
the
animals
are
killed
in
a
ritual
or
ceremony
and
then
eaten.
they
can't
do
that.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that
law
was
not
invalid.
that
law
was
not
analogous
to
this
one.
it
did
not
say
bigamy
is
forbidden
when
done
pursuant
to
the
teachings
of
celestial
marriage,
bigamy
is
bad
when
done
for
religious
reasons.
it
was
an
across-the-board
prohibition,
and--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--it
implemented
a
prohibition
that
had
been
present
in
anglo-american
law
for
centuries,
and
there
had
been
bigamy
by
people
who
were
not
mormons
and
who
were
not
religiously
motivated.
mr.
douglas
laycock
there
may
not
have
been
anybody
else
in
utah
at
that
moment,
but
bigamy
laws
have
been
around
for
a
long
time
because
there
had
been
a
problem
that
the
legislatures
and
the
common
law
had
addressed.
the
legislatures
and
the
common
law
have
never
tried
to
suppress
the
killing
of
animals
in
any
systematic
way,
and
if
this
court
is
willing
to
accept
that
a
definition
of
sacrifice
that
contains
a
hypothetical
fraternity
ritual
is
thereby
not
targeted
religion,
i
think
you
would
equally
have
to
accept
that
a
prohibition
on
communion
is
nondiscriminatory
and
neutral
because
it
might
include
a
fraternity
initiation.
mr.
douglas
laycock
again,
i
think
they
could
do
that
if
they
did
it
in
a
neutral
and
across-the-board
way,
but
many
of
the
killings
that
they
permit
are
slower
and
less
reliable,
crueler
than
the
method
of
sacrifice
by
slicing
the
carotid
arteries,
which
is
the
method
specified
in
the
state
and
federal
humane
slaughter
acts.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
don't
think
it's
an
end
in
itself.
i
hope
that
the
purpose
is
to
build
into
the
political
process
some
of
the
protection
for
religious
minorities
that
the
other
half
of
smith
says
that
the
courts
are
not
going
to
be
providing
on
their
own.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
i
think
the
purpose
is
that
this
court
stands
ready,
it
says
in
smith,
to
say
that
if
you...
if
a
government
singles
out
religion
for
special
burdens
or
special
prohibition,
that
is
forbidden.
you
have
to
at
least
treat
religious
acts
as
well
as
you
treat
analogous
secular
acts.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--well--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--no,
i...
i--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--well--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--i...
i
can't
read
your
minds,
but
i
think
the
purpose
for
which
you
enunciated
that
requirement
is
that
requiring
the
legislature
to
treat
an
unpopular
minority
faith
as
well
as
it
treats
the
bulk
of
the
population
will
give
a
sort
of
self-enforcing
political
protection
to
the
religious
minority.
they
cannot
suppress
sacrifice
unless
they
are
willing
to
suppress
food
killings,
poison
in
people's
yards,
exterminators--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--well,
i
think
that's
right,
but
whether
or
not
the
whole
regime
is
hostile
to
religion
or
whether
only
a
particular
body
of
legislation
or
a
single
law
is
hostile
to
a
particular
religion,
i
think
the
neutrality
requirement
is
designed
to
protect
religious
practices
at
least
to
keep...
it's
a
way
of
avoiding
open
persecution
if
they
can
single
out
a
religion
and
treat
it
differently
from
how
they
treat
everybody
else.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
certainly
avoiding
that
subjective
motivation
i
think
is
part
of
your
purpose,
but
i
don't
think
it
should
be
all
of
the
purposes.
whatever
you
find
about
the
subjective
motive
of
the
council,
if
the
ordinances
on
their
face
forbid
sacrifice
and
do
not
forbid
other
killings,
i
think
that's
discriminatory.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that's
right.
but
i
think
either--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--both
the
objective
and
the
subjective
i
think
are
evidentiary
on
each
other,
but
as
i
read
smith
and
as
i
read
analogous
cases
in
the
equal
protection
context...
washington
v.
davis
and
massachusetts
v.
feeney,
i
think
either
objective
discrimination
in
the
text
of
the
statute
or
a
subjective
discriminatory
motive
is
sufficient
to
put
us
into
the
compelling--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--i
think
that's
right.
mr.
douglas
laycock
yes,
he
did.
he
made
two
findings:
1)
the
city
council's
specific
intention
was
to
prevent
animal
sacrifice
anywhere
in
the
city.
i
think
that,
in
terms
of
discrimination
against
religion,
is
a
finding
of
discrimination.
and
2)
that
the
city
council
did
not
intend
to
discriminate
against
santeria
as
opposed
to
palo
mayombe
or
any
other
animal
sacrificing
religion.
it
was
going
to
treat
all
these
minority
religions
equally,
but
there
was
intent
to
suppress
this
family
of
religions.
mr.
douglas
laycock
when
you
suppress
the
central
ritual,
i
think
you
suppress
the
religion.
mr.
douglas
laycock
the
finding
is--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--right.
mr.
douglas
laycock
that
can
be
suppressed
pursuant
to
neutral
and
generally
applicable
laws
against
murder,
and
i
suppose
even
pursuant
to
the
compelling
interest,
but--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--but
that
is
not
a
universal
or
generally
applicable
law
at
all.
mr.
douglas
laycock
it
applies
only
to
religion.
mr.
douglas
laycock
if
that's
a
valid
argument,
you
really
have
repealed
the
free
exercise
clause.
any
lawyer
in
the
country
with
that
standard
of
drafting
can
draft
an
ordinance
to
get
any
church
that
happens
to
be
at
crosswise
with
the
city
council.
you
know,
it's--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--you
have
to
define
the
act
without
reference
to
the
religious
or
secular
motives,
and
you
have
to
define
the
act
without
reference
to
things
that
are
themselves
inherently
religious.
in
smith,
you--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--you
must
ban
all
killing
of
animals
or
you
must
permit
religious
killing
of
animals.
of
course--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--i
said
we
would
have
a
much
harder
and
closer
case
if
there
were
a
couple
of
narrow--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--that's
right,
but
if
the
self
defense
exception
would
be
permitted
it
would
be
because
of
the
indication
in
smith
that
the
permitted
reasons
are
compellingly
different
from
the
religious
reasons.
mr.
douglas
laycock
you
can...
but
you
don't
take
it
into
account
at
the
neutrality
stage,
you
take
it
into
account
at
the
compelling
interest
stage.
the
argument
would
be
that
saving
human
life
by
killing
an
animal
in
self
defense
is
a
compelling
interest,
and
that
that
distinguishes
that
narrow
exception
from
the
religious
killings
of
animals,
but
what
they've
done
here
is
say,
you
can
kill
animals
for
almost
any
reason...
just
because
you're
tired
of
taking
care
of
them,
that's
a
good
enough
reason.
that's
necessary...
but
not
for
religious
reasons.
mr.
douglas
laycock
i
think
not,
your
honor.
they--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--recited
the
compelling
interest.
mr.
douglas
laycock
they
purported
to,
but--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--they
effectively
equated
it
with
rational
basis.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
there's
no
effort
to
require
the
city
to
show
that
its
compelling
interest
fit
the
discrimination
in
these
statutes.
its
ritual
and
ceremony
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
pain
to
the
animals
or
the
problem
of
disposal.
there
is
no
effort
to
insist
that
the
compelling
interest
be
pursued
in
a
neutral
or
generally
applicable
way.
there
is
no
insistence
that
the
interest
be
especially
important.
what
all
of
these
interests
are
are
incremental
reductions
in
quite
general
problems
that
the
city
manages
for
secular
purposes.
we
have
carcasses
lying
on
the
road
when
pets
are
killed
by
cars.
the
city
doesn't
ban
cars
and
it
doesn't
ban
pets.
it
responds
to
the
problem.
an
incremental
reduction
in
a
general
problem
cannot
be
obtained
at
the
expense
of
the
first
amendment.
that
can...
the
incremental
reduction
can
never
be
a
compelling
interest,
and
that's
really
what
the
district
court
found
over
in--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--yes,
but
the
accident
intention
distinction
doesn't
go
to
the
disposal
problem.
the
disposal
problem
is
this.
there
are...
some
small
fraction
of
all
the
animals
that
are
sacrificed
are
apparently
improperly
disposed
of
by
certain
members
of
these
faiths.
to
eliminate
that
small
fraction,
the
city
says,
we
have
to
forbid
the
entire
practice
of
sacrifice.
the
analogous
pursuit
of
the
interest
would
be
to
forbid
all
ownership
of
pets
because
some
of
them
wind
up
dead
and
lying
on
the
roads.
they've
applied
a
prophylactic
total
ban
to--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--to
sacrifice.
mr.
douglas
laycock
but
most
of
the
people
who
intentionally
sacrifice
do
not
improperly
dispose
of
the
animal.
the
finding
is
most
of
the
sacrificed
animals
are
eaten.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
i
understand,
but
they've
described
the
class
in
a
discriminatory
way.
they've
described
the
class
as...
in
religious
terms
and
enacted
a
total
prohibition
on
the
religious
conduct
to
get
a
tiny
reduction
in
problems
that
they
simply
manage
and
deal
with
in
secular
context
and
they
do
not
have
any
comparable
prohibition
on
the
secular
activities
that
produce
the
very
same
harms.
they
don't
prohibit
hunting
and
other
means
of
cruel
killing,
and
they
don't
prohibit
other
sources
of
garbage,
but
they
prohibit
this
religion
because
they
think
the
religion
is
unnecessary.
mr.
douglas
laycock
you
can
describe
this
as
underinclusiveness
if
you
want,
but
this
is
underinclusiveness
with
a
vengeance,
because
nothing
is
included.
mr.
douglas
laycock
no
killings
of
animals
are
included
except
the
religious
killings
of
animals,
so
it's
underinclusive
in
a
sense,
but
they
really
have
singled
out
religion
for
a
prohibition
that
is
applied
nowhere
else.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
douglas
laycock
the
question
of
whether
this
could
be
done
in
a
slaughterhouse,
the
ordinances
are
clear,
the
ritual
or
ceremony
would
be
illegal
in
hialeah
in
any
kind
of
slaughterhouse
under
any
kind
of
conditions.
the
testimony--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--that
is
not
correct.
it
can
only
be
allowed
where
properly
zoned.
the
city
attorney,
mr.
gross,
testified
that
on
the
farms
in
hialeah
animals
are
slaughtered
under
the
limited
slaughter
exceptions
in
the
ordinances.
i
think
it
is
the
case
that
commercial
slaughter
is
not
going
on
in
residential
or
nonfarm
neighborhoods.
with
respect
to
the
alleged
uniqueness
of
the
problem,
mr.
garrett
summarized
the
testimony
of
the
city's
expert
witness,
mr.
livingstone,
about
disease
factors
and
the
like,
but
remember,
mr.
livingstone
said
repeatedly,
i'm
not
talking
about
animal
sacrifice
at
all,
i'm
talking
about
organic
garbage.
he
said
it
is
no
different,
and
the
sources
of
supply
of
organic
garbage
are
much
greater
from
all
of
the
secular
food
consumption
in
the
city
than
they
are
from
these
sacrifices.
now,
my
clients
have
always
been
willing
to
accept
regulation
of
the
farms
and
botanicas
which
are
not
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
they're
willing
to
accept
reasonable
zoning
on
the
church
itself.
they
are
not
willing
to
give
up
the
rights
of
their
members
to
sacrifice
on
special
occasions
such
as
births
and
weddings
in
the
homes,
but
the
church
itself
can
be
reasonably
zoned,
they're
willing
to
comply
with
disposal
regulations,
but
none
of
that
would
satisfy
the
city.
the
city
sees
a
special--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--we
believe
that
we
are
in
compliance
with
humane
slaughter.
there
is
a
neutral
prohibition
on
torture
and
torment
that
is
not
challenged.
the
district
court
did
not
find
that--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--hmm?
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
it
may--
mr.
douglas
laycock
--well,
because...
because
we're
not
tormenting
and
we're
not
torturing
we
don't
have
to
go
all
the
way.
i
may
be
back
some
year
with
a
different
client
who
does.
[laughter]
the
testimony
is
the
method
of
sacrifice
is
very
quick,
except
when
it
fails.
the
trial
judge
said
it
is
somewhat
unreliable
and
therefore
it
is
cruel.
there
is
no
finding
of
how
often
it
is
unreliable,
how
often
it
misses.
those
who
are
experienced
in
the
method
said
they
believe
they
don't
miss,
but
the
intended
method
of
sacrifice
is
not
cruel.
mr.
douglas
laycock
well,
perhaps
they
could
take
that
into
account
in
a
neutral
and
generally
applicable
way,
but
again,
look
at
all
the
other
methods
of
killing
which
they
permit
with
no
regulation
whatever,
with
no
claim
that
they
might
be...
that
they
have
to
be
always
instantaneous
and
never
a
mistake.
no
human
activity
has
never
a
mistake.
i
can
put
poison
out
in
my
yard
in
hialeah
and
they
don't
tell
me
what
kind.
they
don't
say
it
has
to
be
a
quick-acting
poison.
the
animal
can
wander
off
and
suffer
for
a
week,
and
that's
okay
with
the
city.
that's
expressly
authorized
in
ordinance
87-40.
it's
only
the
religion
that
has
to
be
perfect
if
it
is
to
exist
at
all
inside
the
city.
