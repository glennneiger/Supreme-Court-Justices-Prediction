chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
91-948,
church
of
the
lukumi
babalu
aye,
inc.
v.
the
city
of
hialeah.
mr.
laycock.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
ordinance
define
sacrifice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
when
you
say
sacrifice,
you
are
using
it
in
the
term
that
the
ordinance
defines
it,
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
a
lot
of
bow
and
arrow
hunting
in
the
city
of
hialeah?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
under
our
cases
the
city
can
deal
with
one
perceived
evil
at
a
time
without
having
to
deal
with
the
whole
ball
of
wax,
can't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
that's
the
only
evil
that
is
occurring
in
the...
and
you
say
that's
not
so,
but
supposing
that
the
city
council
thought
that
was
the
only
evil
that
were
occurring
in
the
city
of
hialeah?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
yes,
but
let's
withdraw
from
that
a
little
bit
and
just
say,
supposing
the
city
council
sees
what
they
perceive
as
this
evil,
or
something
that
they
want
to
regulate.
you
say
it
violates
the
first
amendment,
and
you
say
one
reason
it
does
is
there
are
lots
of
other
things
that
they
should
have
embraced,
and
their
response
to
that
is,
well,
none
of
those
were
going
on
in
the
city
of
hialeah.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
i'm
giving--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i'm
giving
you
a
hypothetical.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
the
city
council
require
that
all
slaughter
of
animals
within
the
city
be
done
in
a
humane
manner
and
define
humane
in
a
way
that
the
result
of
which
was
to
either
prohibit
or
require
the
alteration
of
these
sacrifices?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
district
court
make
any
finding
on
the
question
of
discrimination?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
city
can
distinguish
between
accidental
killings
of
pets
by
cars
and
treat
them
one
way
and
intentional
killing
of
animals
on
the
other,
can't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--one
act
is
intentional
and
the
other
is
just
accidental.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
like
so
many
cases
it
depends
on
how
you
describe
your
class.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
laycock.
mr.
garrett,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
might
have
an
ordinance
that
was
easier
to
defend,
though,
in
that
situation,
if
it
had
been
directed
more
precisely
at
the
results
of
these
proceedings
rather
than
at
the
proceedings
themselves.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
opponent
i
thought
agreed
that
the
city
could
prohibit
inhumane
slaughtering
so
long
as
it
did
it
across
the
board.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
garrett.
mr.
laycock,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
humane
slaughter
regulations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
intended
method
is
not
cruel,
could
not
the
city
take
into
account
that
the
intention
just
wasn't
fulfilled
sometimes
and
it
turned
out
to
be
cruel
in
fact?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
laycock.
the
case
is
submitted.
