supposing
somebody
had
a
sick
cat,
that
he
thought
he
had
to
put
him
out
of
his
misery,
is
it
unlawful
in
hialeah
to
kill
your
own
cat?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
for
no
purpose
except
to
put
him
out
of
its
misery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean,
i
couldn't
just
drown
my
own
cat
in
the
bathtub
or
something
like
that?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
forbidden
to
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
i
gave
him
an
injection
of
something
to
put
him
to
sleep,
then,
instead
of
doing
it
in
the
bathtub.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
garrett,
can
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment?
the
court
found
specific
harms
to
the
animals.
they
were
cruel
in
the
way
they
did
it
and
there
were
some
disposal
problems
and
certain
other
specific
problems
that
they
found.
he
also
found,
as
i
remember
it,
there's
a
lot
of
varieties
of
this
religion.
some
have
more
of
some
customs
and
some
have
slightly
different
customs.
supposing
there
was
one
branch
of
the
religion
that
required
as
a
part
of
the
ceremony
that
it
be
conducted
in
a
slaughterhouse
as
justice
kennedy
suggests,
that
it
dispose
of
the
remains
in
a
lawful
manner,
and
that
it
had
none
of
the
side
effects
that
trouble
you,
and
very
properly.
but
you
have
a
religion
that
does
sacrifice
animals.
now,
that
religion
would
be
prohibited
by
your
ordinance
even
if
none
of
the
side
effects
occurred,
or
were
permitted
to
occur
by
the
religion,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
other
thing
that
puzzles
me,
on
the
one
hand
you
say
there
are
tens
of
thousands
of
these
sacrifices
going
on
regularly
and
that's
what
prompted
the
ordinance,
and
then
you
say,
as
one
very
dramatic
example
of
a
goat
being
found
on
the
beach
that
was
apparently
very
unattractive
and
unhealthful--
[laughter]
but...
and
that
dramatic
evidence
is
kind
of
appealing,
you
have
to
say.
but
if
that
happens
only
once
when
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
sacrifices,
which
way
does
the
example
cut?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there's
only
one
in
the
record,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
goats.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
did
those...
they
violate
some
other
neutral
statute
before
this
ordinance
was
passed?
i
mean,
there
must
have
been
some
municipal
regulation
against
leaving
carcasses
around
in
public
parks.
littering,
maybe.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
this
method
of
slaughter
violate
the
state
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
any
of
these
people
ever
been
prosecuted
under
the
state
statute?
