mr.
birnberg,
do
you
take
the
position
that
any
nominal
damages
award
entitles
the
winner
to
get
a
fee
award
for
attorneys'
fees--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--regardless
of
the
context
in
which
it's
given?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
this
court
has
at
least
spoken
in
dicta
to
the
effect
that
a
de
minimis
victory
does
not
justify
the
award
of
fees.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought
that
the
statute
1988
speaks
both
in
terms
of
discretion
whether
to
award
the
fees
and
secondly
that
they
should
be
in
a
reasonable
amount.
and
i
wonder
if
the
very
small
nominal
damages
award
shouldn't
be
taken
into
account
in
any
event
under
those
provisions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
language
in
garland
said
you're
not
entitled
to
any
fee
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
may
not
have
been
felicitous
phrasing,
but
that's
certainly
is
what
it
suggests.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
even
if
they
are
prevailing
parties,
are
they
entitled
to
any
attorneys'
fees
here
under
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
when
the
recovery
is
limited
to
$1.00?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't
take
that
position.
you
say
if
they're
prevailing
parties
they
get
some
attorneys'
fees.
