justice
david
h.
souter
and
in
fact
we
know
from
the
lack
of
damages
that
he
would
have
failed.
he
would
have
failed.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
didn't
he
get,
then
why
didn't
he
get
some
damages?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
very
well
have
been
the
case,
but
that,
i
mean
that's
just
the
luck
that
goes,
good
or
bad,
with
trial
dates,
and
that
kind
of
speculation
can't
be
a
basis
for
determining
an
entitlement
to
counsel
fees.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that's
the
case
aren't
you
in
more
serious
trouble
because
loss
of
reputation
is
not
compensable
in
1983,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
you're
saying
he
got
his
emotional
damages
simply,
damage
for
emotional
distress
simply
as
a
kind
of
pendant
or
consequent
to
damage
to
his
good
name,
and
his
good
name
is
not
subject
to
clearance
under
1983,
then
you
should
be
entitled
to
nothing.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
well,
but
a
minute
ago
you
were
saying
that
it
also
vindicated
his
good
name.
and
do
you
agree
that
his
good
name
is
not
subject
to
litigation
and
damage
to
it
is
not
subject
to
compensation
under
1983?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
you
should,
but
in
any
case
if--
justice
david
h.
souter
--all
right.
but
if
you
don't
trip
into
it
and
if
you
stay
away
from
vindication
of
good
name,
then
aren't
you
right
back
where
you
left
off
with
justice
scalia's
question,
and
that
is
there
has
been
a
finding
that
in
fact
there
was
a
procedural
due
process
violation
but
there
has
been
an
equally
clear
finding,
implicit
as
you
said
a
moment
ago,
that
no
substantial
harm
was
done
by
it.
and
if
we
exclude
reputation
here,
then
absolutely,
absolutely
nothing
was
affected
except
a
pure
procedural
error
per
se.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
could
that
dollars
and
cents
value
be
if
you
accept,
as
i
think
you
do
and
have
to
do,
that
he
had
no
right
to
continue
operating
the
school,
and
with
all
the
procedural
due
process
in
the
world
the
school
would
have
been
shut
down
and
the
result
would
have
been
reached,
the
result
that
would
have
been
reached
is
exactly
the
result
that
was
reached.
where
can
you
find
damage
in
this?
