mr.
finis
e.
cowan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
it
please
the
court:
my
friend
mr.
birnberg
and
i
agree
on
one
significant
point
about
this
case
which
i
think
is
very
relevant
to
one
of
justice
white's
questions
and
one
of
justice
kennedy's
questions.
the
point
that
we
agree
on
is
that
the
verdict
in
this
case
is
truly
obtuse.
we
agree
on
that.
and
that,
your
honor,
justice
white,
is
very
pertinent
to
your
question
of
what
kind
of
a
message
does
this
send.
and
we'll
get
to
this--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--no,
your
honor,
there
was
never
any
judgment
of
any
kind,
even
a
judgment
for
$1.00.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
why
pecuniary
damages?
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
because...
well,
no
judgment
for
nominal
damages
was
ever
entered,
which
is
one
of
the
facts
that
my
friend
and
i
differ
about.
the
court
of
appeals
said
a
judgment
for
$1.00
would
be
appropriate,
but
that
amount
was
so
nominal,
so
technical--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--that
the
judgment
was
never
entered.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
the
jury
in
fact
found
that
there
was.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
and
if
you
look
at
that
single
jury
finding
you
get
one
result.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
but
if
you
look
at
the
whole
case
and
if
you
look
at
the
entire
test
set
forth
in
tsta
v.
garland
you
come
up
with
an
entirely
different
result
than
if
you
look
at
that
one
jury
finding.
and
i
suppose
the
bulk
of
our
plea
to
your
honors
is
to
ask
you
to
look
at
not
a
single
jury
finding
but
to
look
at
the
entire
case.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
you
come
up
with--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--that
can
be
argued,
but
you
come
up
with--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--it's
too
late
to
argue
that.
what
you
come
up
with
is
the
result
that
the
fifth
circuit
majority
came
up
with,
and
that
is
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
applying
the
four-fold
standard
set
forth
in
tsta
v.
garland,
by
no
means
can
these
plaintiffs
be
designated
as
prevailing
parties.
that's,
your
honor,
where
you
come
up
with.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
factually
inaccurate,
your
honor.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
except
that
in
the
record
before
your
honors
and
the
briefs
it
is
factually
undisputed
that
the
judgment
for
$1.00
was
never
entered.
and
that
we
say
is
very,
highly
relevant
although
it's
not
controllable.
i
think
you
would
get
the
same
result,
but
it
is
highly
relevant
to
the
fourth
prong
of
the
standard
which
your
honors
enunciated
so
carefully
in
tsta
v.
garland.
what
i
would
like
to
do
today--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--in
addition
to--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--well,
your
honor,
the,
no
one
has
ever
awarded
these
plaintiffs
any
compensatory
damages.
the
jury
found
from
the
start
that
the
plaintiffs
had
not
proved
actual
damages.
in
other
words
while
the
jury,
perhaps
displeased
in
some
respects
with
the
conduct
of
the
defendants,
they
still
held
that
the
plaintiffs
have
not
proved
that
any
of
the
plaintiff's
rather
considerable
damage
was
caused--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--that's
the
attorneys'
fees,
your
honor.
that's
the
attorneys'
fees
that
were
assessed
against
my
one
single
poor
client
against
whom
there
is
just
this--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--yes,
sir.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
well,
yes,
it's
significant
to
my
client
who
may
have
to
pay
it,
your
honor.
it's
of
great
significance
to
him.
[laughter]
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
well,
yes,
your
honor,
the
$280,000
in
attorneys'
fees
has
real
significance.
but
the
jury
didn't
find
that
the
plaintiff
had
suffered
$280,000
in
damage.
that's
the
attorneys'
fees,
that's
the
full
lode
stone
amount
that
the
trial
court,
in
direct
contravention
of
your
honor's
instructions
in
hensley
v.
eckerhart,
which
i
don't
intend
to
argue
here
today
because
it's
not
the
key
thing
that
i
want
to
say
to
you.
but
the
trial
court,
that's
the
amount
that
the
trial
court
awarded
in
direct
contradiction
to
your
honor's
instructions
that
you
had
given
to
trial
courts
in
hensley
v.
eckerhart
where
justice
powell
said
the
result
is
the
chief
thing
to
look
at.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
with
all
respect,
sir,
that
is
in
our
brief.
i
apologize
if
i
contradict
you,
sir,
but
i
have
read
it
over
and
over
and
it
is
there.
what
i
would
like
to
do,
your
honors,
today
in
addition
to
responding
to
your
very
perceptive
questions
is,
what
i
would
really
like
to
do
is
to
discuss
with
yo
the
very
careful,
the
very
eloquent
standard
enunciated
tsta
v.
garland
and
hewitt
v.
helms,
and
to
demonstrate
your
honors
why
under
the
facts
in
this
case
applying
th
standard
and
the
four
prong
test
in
that
standard
the
plaintiffs
here
can
by
no
means
be
regarded
as
prevailing
parties.
in
addition
to
that,
your
honors,
we
would
als
like
to
talk
to
you
about
one
of
the
aspects
of
the
tsta
v.
garland
in
which
you
ask
what
does
this
case
do
as
a
matter
of
public
policy.
what
are
the
public
policy
ramifications
of
this
and
related
cases.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
yes,
a
prevailing
party
is
entitled
to
some
attorneys'
fees.
it
may
be
nominal--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--if
the
plaintiff
as
prevailing
party
is
entitled
to
some
attorneys'
fees.
now,
under
hensley
v.
eckerhart
the
trial
court
should
look
at
the
amount
as
being
the
crucial
amount,
or
the
trial
court
could
conclude,
although
he
did
not
here,
that
special
circumstances
of
this
case
would
make
any
award
of
attorneys'
fees
inequitable,
but
we
have
not
argued
that.
our--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--they
get
some
attorneys'
fees,
we
say,
and
we
don't...
we
raised
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
have
preserved
the
point
here.
we
say
that
the
trial
court
did
not
apply
hensley
v.
eckerhart
correct
and
we
challenge
the
amount
of
the
attorneys'
fees.
but
as
we
appear
before
your
honor
today
our
principal
purpose
is
to
argue
that
the
plaintiffs
by
no
means
can
be
regarded
as
prevailing
parties,
that
they
just
don't
get
over
the
threshold
at
all
of
being
prevailing
parties.
but
your
honor
is
correct,
the
trial
court
could
have
said
$1.00
in
nominal
damages,
$1.00
in
attorneys'
fees,
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
today,
of
course.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
or
maybe
nothing.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
yes.
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
yes,
we
acknowledge
that
in
some
cases
nominal
damages
will
support,
maybe
in
most
cases,
but
not
in
this
case.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
because,
your
honor,
that
is
a
per
se
rule
and
we
do
not
believe
that
a
per
se
rule
is
called
for
by
the
standards
and
the
test
which
your
honors
set
forth
in
tsta
v.
garland
and
hewitt
v.
helms.
now,
as
a
practical
matter
to
support
your
line
of
reasoning
a
different
trial
judge
differently
motivated
would
have
said
look,
nobody
can
sensibly
say
this
plaintiff
prevailed
or
if
he
did
he
prevailed
at
such
a
minor
level
that
no
substantial
attorneys'
fees
are
called
for,
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
well,
your
honor,
that
goes
to
what
i'm
going
to
respectfully
suggest
to
you
as
the
third
part
of
my
argument,
and
that
is
where
your
honors
ought
to
go
with
this
case
as
far
as
establishing
the
law.
while
i
hope
it's
not
presumptuous,
i
do
have
some
respectful
suggestions
to
make
to
you
in
that
regard.
but
your
honors
in
tsta
v.
garland
and
hewitt
v.
helms
went
to
great
lengths
to
establish
very,
very
carefully
a
standard,
that's
the
way
you
describe
it,
and
you
set
forth
the
various
tests
or
prongs
that
one
needs
to
go
through
in
order
to
determine
whether
that
standard
has
been
met.
and
we
would
respectfully
say
that
when
you
look
at
this
case,
not
an
isolated
part
of
the
case
like
one
jury
finding,
but
when
you
look
at
the
whole
case
one
comes
to
the
conclusion
that
the
plaintiff
has
not
gotten
over
any
of
the
four
hurdles,
and
he
certainly
has
not
gotten
over
the
last
of
those
four
hurdles,
or
the
second
of
the
hurdles
for
that
matter.
the
first
hurdle
is
the
one
where
the
plaintiff
comes
close
to
getting
over
the
hurdle.
and
the
first
aspect
of
the
hurdle
is
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
has
achieved
success
on
a
significant
issue
in
the
lawsuit.
and
civil
rights
are
so
important,
and
your
honors'
regard
for
those
civil
rights
is
so
important
that
it
can
be
certainly
argued
that
in
this
case
the
jury
finding
creates
success
on
the
significant
issue.
we
would
say
here,
however,
that
if
you
look
at
the
entire
jury
verdict
and
if
you
look
at
the
jury
verdict
in
the
light
of
the
pleadings
and
the
facts,
the
plaintiff
has
not
even
established
success
on
a
significant
issue.
and
that
is
true
for
this
reason.
hobby
was
one
of
only
multiple
defendants.
hobby
was
accused,
along
with
the
others,
of
being
a
member
of
a
conspiracy
to
deprive
farrar
of
his
civil
rights.
the
jury
found
that
all
of
the
other
defendants
were
conspirators,
but
that
hobby
was
not.
if
hobby
had
been
found
a
member
of
the
conspiracy
we
wouldn't
be
here
today
because
they
would
have
never
reached
the
issue
that
was
decided
against
hobby.
the
jury
went
on
to
find,
however,
that
the
conspiracy
did
not
cause
these
plaintiffs
any
damage.
in
response
to
a
conditioned
question
they
found
that
hobby
had
committed
an
action
under
state
law
which
deprived
the
plaintiff
of
his
civil
right,
but
that
that
was
not
the
cause
of
any
damage
to
the
plaintiff.
now,
in
the
light
of
the
pleadings
and
the
evidence
that
hobby
did
nothing
alone,
there
was
no
evidence
that
hobby
did
anything
by
himself,
the
jury's
finding
is
senseless.
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
in
the
light
of
the
jury's
finding
that
the
plaintiffs
had
proved
no
damage,
it
is
clear
in
the
light
of
the
evidence,
which
was
largely
undisputed,
that
these
defendants
did
not
cause
the
plaintiffs
any
damage
and
that
the
farrar's
own
conduct
was
the
cause
of
their
rather
considerable
pecuniary
damage.
and
they
had
considerable
pecuniary
damage
which
was
constantly
emphasized
during
the
trial
of
the
case.
so
we
contend
first
of
all
that
if
you
look
at
the
case
as
a
whole,
not
just
a
single
jury
verdict,
that
the
plaintiffs
didn't
get
over
the
first
hurdle
of
proving
significant
success
on
the
material
issue
in
the
case.
the
second
prong
of
the
test
is
even
more
clearly
applicable
to
our
test,
and
that
is
that
the
plaintiff
in
the
language
of
garland
received
some
of
the
relief
which
he
sought.
here,
as
i
think
my
friend
mr.
birnberg
clearly
admits,
the
plaintiff
sought
only
considerable
monetary
compensable
damages.
he
got
not
one
penny
of
compensatory
damages.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
no,
sir.
the
jury
did
not
award
$1.00,
and
that's
a
critical
point
because
the
jury
was
not
even
charged
that
they
had
the
option
of
awarding
$1.00,
and
the
plaintiff
did
not
object
to
the
jury
charge
on
that
basis.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
correct.
now,
punitive
was
conditioned
on
an
affirmative
finding
on
compensatory,
but
the
jury
found
no
compensatory
damage,
which
in
the
light
of
the
evidence
can
only
mean
that
the
jury
concluded
that
the
plaintiffs
were
the
authors
of
their
own
misfortune.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
well,
at
least,
judge,
the
plaintiff
would
have
the
option
of
arguing
that
that
was
some
of
the
relief
which
i
sought.
here--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--your
honor,
i
would
answer
that
question
no
for
this
reason,
and
the
reason
relates
to
a
point
that
we
discuss
in
great
detail
in
our
brief,
and
that
is
the
difference
between
nominal
and
compensatory
damages.
the
scholars
who
have
looked
at
this
question
for
years
have
said
that
nominal
damages
is
not
just
a
little
bit
of
compensatory
damages.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
right.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
no,
justice
stevens,
the
critical
difference
is
this.
in
most
cases
where
nominal
damages
are
awarded
the
evidence
and
the
jury
verdict
will
establish
some
specific
violation
of
right
which
the
plaintiff
has
remedied
or
he
is
in
the
process
of
remedying.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
one
cannot
look
at
the
evidence
or
the
verdict
in
this
case
and
establish
a
single
thing
that
governor
hobby
or
any
other
future
or
past
lieutenant
governor
can
look
at
and
say
that's
not
what
i
should
do.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
carey
v.
piphus
was
a
much
stronger
case
for
attorneys'
fees
than
here,
and
that
goes
to
your
honor's
first
question.
there
the
plaintiffs
did
not
seek
compensatory
damages.
they
didn't
even
bother
to
prove
compensable
damage.
they
had
identified
a
specific
way
in
which
they
were
harmed,
and
they
got
a
judgment
which
said
to
that
specific
defendant
don't
commit
that
specific
kind
of
conduct
any
more.
they
did
in
fact
send
a
message,
and
there
are
plenty
of
cases
like
carey
v.
piphus.
and
so
the
court
in
carey--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--well,
judge,
all
he
did
under
the
undisputed
evidence
was
talk
to
the
press,
send
a
letter
to
commissioner
vowell
saying
look
into
this
situation
and
consult
with
the
attorney
general,
and
attend
a
hearing
which
was
conducted
by
people
over
whom
he
had
no
control.
we
say
that
the
judgment
here
sends
exactly
the
opposite
message,
and
the
wrong
message,
which
is
why
you
have
so
many
amicus
briefs
in
this
case.
because
what
happened
here
and
what
can
happen
in
similar
cases
sends
not
the
right
message,
but
the
wrong
message.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
he
should
have
done.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
well--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--conceded,
your
honor,
and
i
stand
corrected
in
that
regard.
but
my
position
is
that
in
applying
the
standard
of
tsta
v.
garland
you
need
not
look
at
a
single
jury
issue
but
are
permitted
to
look
at
the
entire
four
prongs
of
the
tsta
v.
garland
standard
in
determining
how
you
ought
to
handle
this
case.
and
the
third
of
those
standards
is
the
one
which
justice
o'connor
referred
to
in
some
of
her
questions,
and
that
is
is
the
relief
here
so
de
minimis
that
a
fee
award
is
not
justified,
and
that
was
one
of
the
prongs
of
the
test
which
your
honors
enunciated
in
tsta
v.
garland.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
no,
sir.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
because
in
many
cases
where
nominal
damages
are
awarded
the
plaintiff
has
succeeded
by
the
evidence
and
the
verdict
or
the
court's
finding
in
identifying
a
specific
constitutional
violation--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--there
was
such
a
jury
finding,
your
honor.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
no,
sir,
that
part
was
never
raised.
and
in
support
of
justice
kennedy's
statement,
in
hindsight
if
governor
hobby--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--if
governor
hobby
and
his
lawyers
had
foreseen
the
future
they
undoubtedly
would
have
raised
that
point
on
motion
for
new
trial,
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict.
but
in
the
practical
context
of
this
case
no
one
after
the
jury
verdict
in
this
case,
and
i
think
i
can
say
this
without
any
dispute,
no
one
foresaw
that
15
years
later
mr.
hobby
would
be
surprised
by
an
award
of
$270,000
in
attorneys'
fees
in
a
case
he
felt
he
had
won,
and
which
everybody
else
felt
he
had
won.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
exactly,
sir.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
and
that's
a
situation
that
will
rarely
arise,
particularly
if
your
honors
send
the
type
of
message
that
i
would
respectfully
suggest
to
you
that
you
should
send
by
your--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--we
certainly
would
make
an
argument
based
on--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--well,
we
would
make
an
argument
based
on
hensley
v.
eckerhart
below,
and
here
we
principally
rely
on
tsta
v.
garland
and
hewitt
v.
helms.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
no,
your
honor,
because
i
would
still
argue
that
he
hadn't
gotten
over
the
last
two
prongs
of
the
test,
but
i
will
concede
to
you
that
that
would
be
a
lot
better
case
for
the
plaintiff's
receiving
attorneys'
fees
than
this
case.
and
that,
and
part
of
that,
your
honor,
rests
on
your
honors'
decision
in
hewitt
v.
helms.
on
monday
i
heard
judge
stevens
say
very
rare
that
we
get
a
four
square
decision
up
here,
an
on
all
fours
case.
and
i'm
sure
you
don't
get
the
luxury
of
dealing
with
cases
on
the
basis
of
all
four
decisions.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
no,
sir,
it's
not.
but
it's
mighty
close.
mighty
close.
[laughter]
it's
as
close,
i
would
submit,
as
you're
ever
going
to
get.
and
the
one,
the
decision
that
i
would
respectfully
urge
your
honors
is
as
close
as
four
corners
as
you're
ever
going
to
get
is
hewitt
v.
helms.
and
it
relates,
your
honor,
to
the
question
judge
white
asked
about
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
didn't
in
effect
get
a
declaratory
judgment
here,
and
you
read
hewitt
v.
helms
and
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
helms
had
a
lot
better
case
for
attorneys'
fees
than
do
the
plaintiffs
here.
helms
got
a
finding
from
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
defendants
had
violated
his
civil
rights
in
two
very
specific
ways.
but
when
the
case
went
back
helms
was
out
of
prison,
and
the
basic
fact
of
hewitt
v.
helms,
and
helms
probably
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
declaratory
judgment
or
he
probably
would
have
been
entitled
to
expungment,
but
the
teaching
of
tsta
v.
garland
which
used
hewitt
v.
helms
as
an
example
of
de
minimis
victory
is
that
a
mere
identification
and
a
finding
of
a
violation
of
civil
rights
when
it
doesn't
stop
the
defendant's
conduct,
when
it
doesn't
change
the
relationship,
does
not
get
over
the
de
minimis
hurdle.
your
honors
used
that
as
an
example--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--no,
sir.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
no,
sir.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
no,
sir,
because
of
the
exchange
which
judge
rehnquist
and
i
had
earlier.
may
i
speak
to
you
for
a
minute
about--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--and
that
proves
it's
de
minimis,
your
honor.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
no,
sir.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
we
say
in,
we
raise
the
point
in
the
brief
that
the
judgment
was
never--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--may
i
speak
to
your
honors
as
to
where,
assuming
that
you
agree
with
me
or
have
some
agreement
with
me
in
what
i'm
saying,
where
we
think
you
ought
to
go
with
this
case?
we
think
what
you
ought
to
do,
your
honors,
is
say
when
we
decided
tsta
v.
garland
and
hewitt
v.
helms
we
were
serious,
we
were
setting
up
a
standard.
the
standard
does
in
fact
have
objective
requirements.
we
think
those
objective
requirements
should
be
looked
at
and
should
be
met.
we
also
say
to
your
honors
that--
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
--we
don't
think
it's
a
controlling
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
finis
e.
cowan
i'm
sure,
your
honor,
if
that's
what,
that's
the
way
you
read
our
brief
that's
the
way
it
should
be
read.
but
one,
another
thing
that
our
adversary
and
i
agree
on
is
the
importance
of
carey
v.
piphus.
carey
v.
piphus
we,
with
respectful
for
your
honors,
is
frequently
miscited
or
overstated.
what
the
plaintiff
was
attempting
to
establish
in
carey
v.
piphus
was
that
constitutional
rights
were
so
different
from
usual
rights
that
the
plaintiff
was
entitled
to
an
award
of
compensatory
damages
even
if
he
hadn't
proved
any.
that
approach
was
rejected,
and
it
was
rejected
by
justice
powell
saying
this,
rights,
constitutional
and
otherwise,
do
not
exist
in
a
vacuum.
their
purpose
is
to
protect
persons
from
injuries,
to
protect
particular
interests.
our
legal
system's
concept
of
damages
reflects
this
view
of
legal
rights.
the
cardinal
principle
of
damages
in
anglo-american
law
is
that
of
compensation
for
the
injury
caused
to
plaintiff
by
defendant's
breach
of
duty.
and
we
say
to
your
honors
that
the
key
fact
in
this
case
is
that
the
jury's
verdict
says
loud
and
clear
that
these
defendants
and
their
conduct
did
not
cause
any
injury
to
these
plaintiffs.
and
in
the
light
of
that,
your
honor,
we
say
it
would
be
inconceivable
that
the
plaintiffs
could,
using
ordinary,
standard,
common
sense
language
be
deemed
to
be
prevailing
parties.
thank
you
very
much.
