no,
that
can
be
valuable
to
your
client
or
to
the
plaintiff
where
the
client
is
still
in
the
business,
and
so
that
deprivation
will
not
occur
again
in
the
future,
or
at
least
where
it
is
not
terribly
fact
bound
it
might
be
useful
to
some
other
people.
but
i
don't
see
how
this
adjudication
that
on
these
peculiar
facts
there
had
been
a
violation
of
due
process
benefits
anybody
in
the
world,
neither
the
plaintiff
in
the
future
nor
anybody
else
in
the
future.
the
only
thing
to
come
out
of
this
case
is
nominal
damages.
what
other
good
came
out
of
it,
and
a
statement
that
this
person
was
wronged
in
the
past?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not...
what
does
vindicate
mean?
i
don't
know
what
vindicate...
what
does
vindicate
mean?
i
thought
vindicate
means
you
get
something
out
of
it.
you
get
money
or
you
get
the
other
fellow
to
say
i
won't
do
it
again,
or
something
like
that.
this
is
just
sort
of
a
bare
acknowledgement
that
somebody
created,
made
a
technical
mistake
in
the
past
which
as
far
as
we
know
didn't
cause
any
damage
to
anybody.
that
is
vindication?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
intervene
and
correct
it,
but
the
court
did
not
correct
anything.
it
neither
said
don't
do
it
again,
nor
did
it
say
here's
the
money
for,
you
know,
pay
him
money
for
having
done
it
in
the
past.
it
didn't
correct
a
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
maybe
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
maybe
nothing.
why,
why
does
it
make
more
sense
to
make
the
trial
court
go
through
a
separate
determination
of
whether...
you
acknowledge
that
in
some
cases
nominal
damages,
where
nominal
damages
are
awarded
there
will
have
been
success
on
the
merits.
you
don't
say
that
nominal
damages
never
justify
attorneys'
fees,
do
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
then
why
does
it
make
sense
to
do
it
in
a
two-step
process
instead
of
in
a
one-step
process?
why
do
you
have
to
have
the
district
judge
first
ask
himself
whether
he
is
a
prevailing
party
given
that
it's
nominal
damages,
and
then
go
through
well,
you
know,
and
then
step
two,
having
decided
that
even
though
it's
nominal
damages
he
is
a
prevailing
party,
then
go
through
analyzing
well,
how
much
money
should
i
give
him?
why
not
compress
the
two
into
one
and
say
look,
whenever
he
gets
damages,
nominal
or
not,
he
is
a
prevailing
party.
and
it's
in
the
step
two
when
you
decide
how
much
money
he
ought
to
get
that
you
come
in
and
say
well,
it's
so
nominal
that
it's
not
worth
anything,
i'm
going
to
give
him
no
attorneys'
fees,
or
$1.00
attorneys'
fees.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
point
is
if
you're
dealing
with
a
trial
judge
who's
going
to
make
that
mistake
when
you
split
it
into
a
two-step
process,
he's
going
to
make
it
when
you
have
it
in
a
one-step
process
as
well.
it
really
doesn't
matter,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
point
is
that
in
this
case,
unlike
in
most
cases,
although
the
defendant
was
found
guilty
of
a
constitutional
violation
we
have
no
idea
even
what
that
constitutional
violation
was?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
that's
not
a
situation
that
will
always
arise?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
i
presume
that
if
we
find
that
ipso
facto
nominal
damages
renders
somebody
a
prevailing
party
you
would
continue
to
make
this
same
argument
when
it
goes
back
down
on
the
amount
of
the
fees.
justice
antonin
scalia
you'd
make
the
same
argument.
you'd
say
look--
