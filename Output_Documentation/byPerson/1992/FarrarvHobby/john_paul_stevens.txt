justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
case
would
really
be
different
if
they
found
the
$1.00
nominal
damages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
did
recover
$1.00
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
which
is
some
of
the
relief
they
sought
under
the
same
light,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
earlier
you
said,
and
this
is
what
puzzles
me
about
your
argument,
if
i
remember
correctly
you
said
in
many
if
not
most
cases
where
nothing
is
recovered
except
nominal
damages
fees
could
properly
be
awarded,
but
not
in
this
case
because
this
case
is
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
difference,
i
gather,
is
the
jury
didn't
do
it
until
after
the
second,
even
the
jury
didn't
do
it
then
but
it
took
two
appeals
to
get
the
dollar
recovery.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
take
carey
against
piphus,
those.
would
you
say
fees
should
have
been
awarded
there?
carey
against
piphus.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
don't
you
think
the
effect
of
this
judgment
will
be
to
suggest
to
the
defendant
not
to
do
the
same
thing
all
over
again?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
your
client
owes
the
plaintiff
$1.00?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
you
pay
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
you
owe
$1.00
after
what
the
court
of
appeals
did?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
know
in
your
brief
in
opposition
at
page
5
you
say
according
to
the
inquiry
here
is
whether
joseph
farrar's
recovery
of
$1.00
in
nominal
damages
constitutes
a
material
alteration,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
but
now
you're
saying
there
was
no
recovery
of
$1.00.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
not
what
you
said
in
your
brief
in
opposition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
brief
as
i
read
it
assumes
there
was
recovery
of
$1.00,
and
that's
what
i
thought
was
true.
you
say
it
on
page
4,
the
recovery
of
$1.00
as
nominal
damages.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cowan,
i
have
to
interrupt
you
again,
because
you
really
rely
on
the
absence
of
a
judgment.
page
7,
you
say
the
farrar's
were
granted
just
one
thing,
they
got
$1.00.
then
you
have
a
footnote
that
says
in
fact
the
district
court
never
signed
a
judgment
against
hobby
for
the
$1.00.
but
you
don't
attach
any
legal
significance
to
that
fact
that
you
make
in
a
footnote,
you
just
sort
of
point
it
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
didn't
attach
any
significance
to
it
in
your
brief
in
opposition,
at
least
i
can't
find
that
you
did.
