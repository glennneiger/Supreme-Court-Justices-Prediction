91-990,

pat
smith
v.
william
hobby.
mr.
birnberg.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
birnberg,
did
you
seek
other
relief
than
monetary
damages
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
wasn't
as
if
you
had
obtained
an
adjunction
or,
all
you
wanted
was
money
damages
and
you
got
nominal
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
certainly
differs
rather
sharply
from
an
injunction
in
that
nobody
is
ordered
by
the
court
to
do
anything
other
than
to
pay
nominal
damages.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
subject
though
to
this,
declaratory
judgments
are
subject
to
some
of
the
same
rules
that
injunctions
are.
i
don't
think
you
can
get
an
injunction
about
conduct
which
is
simply
in
the
past
and
that
there's
no
prospect
of
repeating.
i
would
think
the
same
rule
would
apply
to
declaratory
judgments.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
birnberg.
mr.
cowan,
we'll
hear
from
your.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
as
a
factual
matter,
mr.
cowan,
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit
says
that
following
remand
from
that
court
the
trial
court
awarded
the
farrar's
$1.00
in
nominal
damages.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we're
certainly
not
going
to
delve
into
that
here.
i
think
you
take
that
as
a
given
in
order
to
deal
with
the
question
presented.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cowan,
the
question
presented
here
by
the
petitioners
was
whether
the
award
of
reasonable
attorneys'
fees
to
civil
rights
plaintiffs
wh
recover
nominal
damages
is
proper.
and
in
your
brief
in
opposition
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
raised
any
question
about
the
fact
that
$1.00
had
been
awarded
in
damages.
so
i
suggest
you
not
argue
that
point.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
was,
the
jury
then
did
not
award
$1.00?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cowan.
mr.
birnberg,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
just
as
respondent
is
stuck
with
the
$1.00
award
because
it's
in
the
question
presented,
i
don't
see
what
you
gain
by
arguing
that
there
was
an
improper
jury
instruction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
birnberg.
the
case
is
submitted.
