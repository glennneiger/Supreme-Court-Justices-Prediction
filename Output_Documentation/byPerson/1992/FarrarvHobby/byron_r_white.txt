justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
denial
of
procedural
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
the,
was
the
proceeding...
was
due
process
finally
given?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
the
school,
are
we
talking
about
a
school?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
was
shut
down?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
has
never
opened?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
it
conceded
that
it
didn't
deserve
to
be
opened?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
school
should
have
been,
that
the
jury
found
that
if
due
process
had
been
given
it
still
would
have
been
closed.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
lose
on
the
merits,
you
lose
on
the
merits
but
by
the
wrong
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
lost
on
the
merits
of
whether
the
school
should
be
open.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
only
problem
was
that
they,
that
it
was
by
the
wrong
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
wouldn't
have
gotten
any
damages
without
a
rule,
without
having
a
rule
of
law
announced
that
would
permit,
that
would
entitle
you
to.
and
you
got
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
got
in
effect
a
declaratory
judgment
at
least.
justice
byron
r.
white
let
me
ask
you,
do
you
suppose
that
you
could
have
stayed
in
court
and
litigated
a
procedural
due
process
violation
if
you
claimed
no
damages
at
all?
just
say
i
want
a
declaratory
judgment
that
there
was
a
violation
of
procedural
due
process.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
i
didn't
ask
that.
all
he
wants
is
a
procedural
due
process
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
presents
a
case
in
controversy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
ought
to
say
that,
maybe
you
ought
to
say
that
maybe
the
civil
rights
laws
and
the
attorneys'
fee
provisions
are
to
sort
of
get
people
to
act
as
private
attorneys
general.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
i
suppose
your
judgment
sends
a
message
to
other
state
officials.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
there
had
to
be
the
equivalent
of
a
declaratory
judgment
here
that
the
procedural
due
process
rights
were
violated.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
pecuniary
damages
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean
why
nominal
damages
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right,
but
anyway--
justice
byron
r.
white
--why
would
the
court
of
appeals
have
said
nominal
damages
unless
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
due
process
rights,
which
it
said
there
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
the
case
is
all
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
when
you
look
at
it
what
do
you
come
up
with?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
there
shouldn't
have
been
even
nominal
damages,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
aren't
arguing
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
found
no
compensatory
or
punitive
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
that
basis
you
should
say
that
in
any
case
where
only
nominal
damages
are
awarded
there
should
be
no
fee.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
not?
that's
so
minimum.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here's,
the
court
of
appeals
says
we
have
awarded
nominal
damages
not
to
exceed
$1.00
when
an
infringement
of
a
fundamental
right
was
shown.
and
because
the
jury
explicitly
found
that
defendant
hobby
had
violated
farrar's
civil
rights
the
jury
should
have
awarded
farrar
nominal
damages
not
to
exceed
$1.00.
and
it
was
there
for
the
trial
court
not
to
do
so
when
the
farrar's
so
moved
in
their
motion
for
a
new
trial.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
was
a
specific
finding
that
the,
that
your
client
had
violated
a
fundamental
constitutional
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
accepted
it
and
said
that
there
was.
you
didn't,
you
didn't
convince
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
wasn't
any
violation
of
a
constitutional
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
should
have
cross-appealed,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
spelled
out
here
in
so
many
words
what
this
fundamental
violation
of
a
fundamental
right
was,
that
here's
what
happened
and
here's
what
he
did,
you
would
say
the,
would
you
say
the
plaintiff
was
then
a
prevailing
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
this
is
one,
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
have
never,
they,
your
opposition
says
it
isn't
worth
collecting,
i
guess.
