justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
lieutenant
governor
didn't
have
the
authority
to
close
the
school?
what
is
your,
was
your
theory
of
the
lieutenant
governor's
liability?
he
was
a
co-conspirator
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
just
have
one
other
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
he
argue
that
there
was
some,
that
there
was
a
privilege?
did
he
argue
that
he
had
a
privilege
to
make
these
statements?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
any
event
we
take
the
case
with
the
jury
finding
against
the
lieutenant
governor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
your
good
name--
--was
that
the
basis
for
the
jury
finding,
that
his
good
name
was
taken?
i
thought
the
basis
for
the
jury
finding
was
that
the
school
was
improperly
closed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
the
procedural
due
process
rights
had
to
be
to
vindicate
the
closing
of
the
school,
not
damage
to
reputation,
or
am
i
incorrect
about
that?
did
you,
was
there
an
instruction
to
the
jury
that
they
were
entitled
to
compensate
for
damage
to
reputation?
no.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seemed
to
me
what
your
client
should
have
done
was
to
appeal
the
jury
verdict
on
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
take
the
case
based
on
a
finding
that
he
violated
due
process
rights,
procedural
due
process
rights.
carey
v.
piphus
says
this
is
of
great
importance,
it's
of
importance
all
of
its
own,
and
i
don't
think
you
can
impeach
the
verdict
the
way
you're
doing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
take
this
case
on
the
assumptions
that
the
lieutenant
governor
by
his
activities
in
this
case
violated
the
due
process
rights
of
the
defendants,
of
the
plaintiffs.
