wants
to
ask
you
a
question.
is
there
any
significance
at
all
in
the
amount
that
the
district
judge
originally
gave
as
damages
in
six
figures?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
what
is
the
significance
of
that
$280,000
figure?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i'm
asking
about
its
significance.
we're
speaking
of
attorneys'
fees
here,
aren't
we?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
of
course
that's
faded
into
the
background,
but
is
there
any
significance
in
that
six
figure
figure?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
keep
emphasizing
$1.00
and
the
absence
of
a
judgment.
i
just
say
that
in
the
background
of
this
record
there
is
another
figure
that,
and
i'm
asking
you
whether
it
has
any
real
significance.
