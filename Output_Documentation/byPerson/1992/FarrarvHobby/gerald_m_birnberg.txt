mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
carey
v.
piphus
this
court
held
that
procedural
due
process
is
so
important
to
organized
society
that
it
is
actionable
even
without
a
showing
of
actual
damages.
in
this
case
a
jury
found
that
the
respondent
had
knowingly
violated
joseph
farrar's
constitutional
rights
to
procedural
due
process
essentially
by
obtaining
a
closing
of
this
school
for
incorrigible
delinquent
children
without
prior
administrative
proceedings
and
hearings
to
which
he
was
entitled
under
state
law
and
by
the
process
of
a
state
court
proceeding
that
didn't
involve
a
fair
and
unbiased
judge.
in
all
events
the
fifth
circuit
in
1985
concluded
on
the
basis
of
that
jury
verdict
that
the
petitioner
was
entitled
at
least
to
nominal
damages,
it
having
been
found
by
the
jury
that
his
rights
to
procedural
due
process
have
been
violated.
they
found
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
that
same
jury
had
also
found
that
dr.
farrar
had
been
unable
to
prove
that
he
had
sustained
actual
damages,
but
of
course
under
carey
against
piphus
that
was
essentially
irrelevant.
he
was
entitled
to
an
award
of
nominal
damages.
the
question
in
this
case
is
does
that
final
determination
of
entitlement
to
a
judgment
for
nominal
damages,
not
more
than
$1.00,
in
a
case
involving
the
deprivation
of
procedural
due
process
entitle
the
plaintiff
who
recovered
that
judgment
to
also
recover
reasonable
attorneys'
fees
under
42
united
states
code
section
1983.
we
submit
that
the
question,
that
the
answer
to
that
question
can
be
found
in
four
separate
places.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
the
denial
of
procedural
due
process
was
very
complex,
justice
white.
it
involved
essentially
two
things.
number
one,
it
involved
having
a
decision
made
to
shut
down
the
school
and
not
utilize
the
administrative
procedures
that
texas
law
provided.
and
secondly
it
involved
interfering
with
the,
there
was
a
district
court
hearing,
a
temporary
restraining
order,
and
at
that
district
court
hearing
there
was,
it
was
an
ex
parte
hearing--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--was
due
process
finally
given?
i
don't
know
that
that
question
was
ever
presented
to
the
jury,
nor
is
it
in
this
record,
justice
white.
our
view
of
that
fact
is
no.
but
i
would
say
this,
and
i
think
this
is
the
gravamen
of
your
question--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--the
school
was
closed.
yes.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
it
was
shut
down
and
it
remained
closed.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
it
has
never
opened.
it
was
never
reopened.
and
in
fact--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--well,
conceded
by
whom?
it
is
conceded
that
that's
what
the
verdict
of
the
jury
implicitly
holds,
that
by
finding
that
we
had
not
proved
actual
damages
i
think
that
that
in
fact
establishes
that
the
jury--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--i
think
that's
a
fair
inference
of
what
one
could
read
into
the
jury
verdict.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
lose
which
by
the
merits,
justice
white?
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
we
certainly
lost
on
the
merits
of
whether
the
school
should
be
opened
or
should
be
closed.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
i
think
in
part
that's
true.
i
think
the
point
was
that
there
was
never
a
process
that
was
provided.
but
i
think
this
is
of
crucial
importance,
the
decision
on
the
merits
before
the
jury,
all
that
said
is
we
did
not
prove
any
actual
damages
from
the
closing
without
due
process.
that's
something
that
occurred
in
a
trial
that
occurred
10
years
after
the
fact.
by
that
time
dr.
farrar
had
died.
he
wasn't
present
to
testify
to
many
of
the
things
that
were
brought
to
the,
brought
forth
for
the
first
time
during
the
course
of
that
proceeding.
but
in
all
events,
justice
white,
that's
not
the
question
that's
presented
here,
whether
the
jury's
verdict
was
right
or
wrong.
the
question
that's
presented
here
is
whether
or
not
having
recovered
a
judgment
that
says
procedural
due
process
was
violated,
and
carey
against
piphus
says
that
is
a
judgment
which
is
vindicated
by
award
of
nominal
damages
whether
we,
since
we
prevailed
to
that
extent
whether
we
are
entitled
to
reasonable
attorneys'
fees,
whether
we
are
a
prevailing
party
at
that
point.
we
submit
that--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--no,
in
fact
he
acted
substantively.
justice
kennedy,
the
lieutenant
governor
under
texas
law
had
no
role
in
the
closing
of
this
school
whatsoever.
he
was
in
the
midst
of
a
heated
political
contest
and
for
reasons
of
furthering
his
political
contest
the
evidence
at
trial
was,
the
theory
at
trial
was
that
he
had
intervened
by
calling
the
commissioner,
he
did
have
the
authority
in
telling
the
commissioner
he
wanted
the
school
closed
and
without
the
administrative
procedures
being
followed.
then
lieutenant
governor
hobby,
despite
the
fact
that
he
had
no
relationship
to
the
closing
of
the
school,
actually
went
to
the
hearing
in
liberty
county,
which
was
an
ex
parte
hearing,
the
theory
that
was
presented
to
the
jury
being
that
that
was
to
bring
political
pressure
to
bear
on
the
fact
finder
to
make
him
not
an
impartial
fact
finder
in
the
procedural
due
process
sense.
now,
governor
hobby
could
have
challenged,
had
he
chosen
to
do
so,
the
fact
finding
that
he
violated
the
petitioner's
rights
in
the
fifth
circuit
in
1985
or
in
the
district
court
earlier
than
that.
for
whatever
reason
he
did
not
undertake
to
do
so
and
this
case
involves
that
as
a
given.
that
is
to
say
the
given
is
that
the
procedural
due
process
rights
were
violated.
we
submit
that
the
plain
language--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
a
privilege
to
make
the
statements?
i
do
not
recall
ever
having
seen
that
in
any
of
the
pleadings
or
any
of
the
briefs.
i
do
not...
well,
there
was
a
qualified
immunity
issue
that
was
submitted,
but
i
don't
think
that's
what
you
have
in
mind
when
you
ask
about
privilege.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
i
believe
that's
the
posture
of
the
case
at
the
present
time,
mr.
justice.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
justice
o'connor,
i
take
the
position--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--yes,
if
it
is
a
procedural
due
process
violation
which
is
thereby
vindicated
according
to
carey
against
piphus.
in
all
candor
in
preparing
for
the
argument
i
have
tried
to
conjure
up
what
might
be
a
nominal
damage
situation
that
would
not
involve
an
entitlement
to
attorneys'
fees.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
that's
absolutely
correct.
in
your
opinion
for
the
court
in
tsta
v.
garland
there
is
that
sentence
of
dictum,
and
it's
purely
technical
or
de
minimis
is
the
standard
that
you
referred
to.
we
believe
that
this
case
does,
that
a
nominal
damages
award
in
a
carey
against
piphus
case
does
not
involve
de
minimis
victory
nor
technical
victory
for
a
number
of
reasons.
let
me
direct
first
the
question
of
de
minimis.
the
term
de
minimis
refers
to
a
type
of
injury
which
is
so
trifling
that
the
law
can't
take
it
into
account,
the
law
can't
do
anything
about
it.
that's
what
the
phrase
de
minimis
non
curat
lex
means,
the
law
can't
do
anything
about
it
because
it
is
so
trifling.
in
fact
carey
against
piphus
specifically
says
that
the
law
can,
will,
and
indeed
must
do
something
about
procedural
due
process
violations,
namely
give
a
judgment,
albeit
for
$1.00.
that
means
that
the
law
will,
in
fact
this
is
the
phrase
that
comes
out
repeatedly
both
in
carey
and
of
course
in
memphis
community
schools
v.
stachura,
vindicate
the
right
to
procedural
due
process.
procedural
due
process
rights
are
intrinsically
non-pecuniar.
they
are
the
type
of
things
that
don't
necessarily
result
in
money
damages
occurring.
so
how
do
you
cure
those
kinds
of
problems
which
are
so,
procedural
due
process
being
so
fundamentally
important
to
the
society.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
of
course
it
should,
and
our
point
is
not
that
you
should
not
take
into
account
the
amount
of
the
recovery
in
fixing
what
is
a
reasonable
fee.
but
as
you
said
yourself,
your
honor,
in
tsta
v.
garland,
where
it
goes
into
the
formula
is
in
figuring
the
amount
that
constitutes
a
reasonable
fee,
not
in
establishing
whether
you
have
crossed
the
threshold
to
any
fee
at
all.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
i
would...
you
were
the
author
of
the
opinion,
your
honor--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--but
i
would
respectfully--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--oh,
you're
talking
about
the
dictum?
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
i
think
the
dictum
says
that...
in
fact
that's,
the
dictum
even,
your
honor,
says
that
there
may
be
cases
which
are
so
technical
or
de
minimis
that
a
district
court
would
be
justified,
not
that
it
would
be
mandatory
but
that
a
district
court
would
be
justified
in
concluding
that
the
minimum
threshold
we
announce
today
has
not
been
satisfied.
but
in
fact
the
holding
of
the
court,
the
holding
of
the
court
in
tsta
v.
garland
is
that
you
are
entitled,
you
are
regarded
as
a
prevailing
party
entitled
to
recover
fees
if
you
have
succeeded
on
any
significant
issue
in
the
litigation
that
produces
some
of
the
benefit
sought
in
bringing
suit.
certainly
that's
what
occurred
here.
we
can't...
if
we
focus
exclusively
on
the
amount
of
the
damages
which
were
recovered,
$1.00,
then
we
have
ignored
justice
white's
admonitions
in
blanchard
against
bergeron
that
civil
rights
cases
are
not
driven
by
trying
to
up
the
amount
of
money
damages
that
are
recovered.
what's
important
in
civil
rights
cases
of
course
is
the
constitutional
right
that's
involved.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
in
the
third
amended
complaint,
your
honor,
no.
the
third
amended
complaint
sought
only
money
damages.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
well,
rule
54
of
course
says
that
we're
entitled
to
any
relief
that
the
evidence
at
trial
supports.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
exactly,
your
honor.
that
is
precisely--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--that
is
precisely
the
point,
your
honor.
that
is
what
is
so
unique.
i
was
contemplating
last
night,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
nominal
damages
award
really
in
many
theoretical
respects
is
closer
to
the
traditional
equitable
relief
of
injunction
or
declaration
than
the
traditional
tort
type
relief.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
it's
certainly,
that's
certainly
correct,
your
honor,
but
what
it
does
is
it
adjudicates
that
there
has
been
a
constitutional
deprivation.
and
that
is
the
crucial
point
here.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
but
you
see,
that's
an
important
thing.
a
statement
that
this
person
was
wronged
was,
and
in
this
context,
justice
scalia,
and
that
is
in
a
situation
in
which
a
person's
good
name
is
at
stake.
had
dale
farrar
been
given
procedural
due
process
he
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
at
least
make
his
case
at
the
time.
that--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--well,
i
think
that's
not
correct.
i
think,
justice--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--we
did
not
prove
the
monetary
damages
which
he
would
have,
that
he
sustained.
and
that's
an
important
distinction.
we
don't...
and
secondly
and
more
importantly
because
the
trial
happens
years
later
once
dr.
farrar
is
in
fact
dead,
there
were
witnesses
who
testified
at
that
trial
who
had
never
surfaced
before
joseph
farrar's
death.
therefore
there
was
no
possible
opportunity
to
rebut
what
they
had
to
say.
had
they
made
their
statements
in
1973
at
a
procedural
due
process
opportunity
then
dr.
farrar
may
very
well
have
been
able
to
rebut
it.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
that
is
the
reason
that
procedural
due
process
is
so
vital.
that
is
the
reason
that
we
insist
and
the
constitution
insists
that
procedural
due
process
take
place.
now,
given
the
fact
that
is
established
by
the
jury
verdict
that
this
petitioner
had
his
rights
to
procedural
due
process
violated,
then
the
question
is
what,
i
guess
what
justice
scalia's
question
is
is
what
benefit
comes
from
that.
and
the
benefit
that
comes
from
that
is
that
originally
dale
farrar,
had
he
lived,
dale
farrar's
estate
can
say
that
the
procedure
by
which
my
good
name
was
taken
from
me
was
fundamentally
flawed,
it
was
a
flawed
procedure.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
that
means
had
it
not
been
a
flawed
procedure
the
same
result
might
not
have
obtained,
but
it
was
a
flawed
procedure.
and
when
your
good
name
is
taken
by
a
flawed
procedure
the
law
says
that
must
be
vindicated.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
justice
kennedy,
it's
very,
i
can't
give
you
a
yes
or
no
answer
to
that
question
because
the
jury
verdict
was
regrettably
obtuse.
the
jury
verdict
says
that
you
find
that
lieutenant
governor
hobby
violated
the
constitutional
rights
of
joseph
farrar.
now,
in
the
various
pleadings
that
the
respondent
has
filed
throughout
the
course
of
these
proceedings,
the
respondent
has
said
that
what
that
jury
verdict
meant
was
that
his
procedural
due
process
rights
were
violated,
and
that's
therefore
what
i
am
essentially
relying
on.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
i'm
not
sure
that...
well,
i
will
answer
that
question
during
my
time
on
rebuttal.
i
have
the
jury
instructions
here
and
i'm
not
sure
that
they
did
not
in
fact
permit
that.
i
do
know
this,
justice
kennedy,
they
permitted
the
emotional
distress
that
dr.
farrar,
they
would
have
permitted
the
emotional
distress
to
which
dr.
farrar
was
subjected
to
be
compensated.
that
can
only
have
come
necessarily
from
loss
to
reputation,
loss
of,
the
closing
of
the
school
would
not
have
given
rise
to
claims,
it
seems
to
me,
for
emotional
distress.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
well--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--i
am
saying,
justice
souter,
no,
in
fact
not.
i'm
saying,
justice
souter,
that
what
he
benefitted
was
he
got
a
judgment,
and
enforceable
judgment
which
vindicated
his
rights
to
procedural
due
process.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
candidly
i
don't,
but
i
don't
believe
that
that's
presented
by
the
case--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--i
believe
there
are
certain
circumstances
in
which
one
has
a
liberty
interest.
i
also
understand...
in
one's
good
name.
i
also
understand
that
that's
a
pretty
complex
additional
area
of
the
law
and
i
don't
mean
to
trip
into
that,
if
i
can
avoid
it.
my
point--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--i
don't
believe
that
is
correct.
i
think
the
error
in
that
question,
justice
souter,
is
in
the
suggestion
that
that,
question
number
8
that
says
how
much
was
he
damaged,
and
the
jury
says
nothing,
that
that
necessarily
means
that,
everything
that
you
imply
in
your
question.
i
believe
that
all
that
means
is
that
we
failed
in
our
burden
of
proof
to
prove
the
dollars
and
cents
value
of
the
procedural
due
process
violation.
i
believe
that
the
vindication
was--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--i'm
sorry,
i
would
like
to
concede
that.
i
can't
concede
that
point.
i
don't
believe
that
the
record
necessarily
shows
that
to
be
the
case.
the
jury
found
only
that,
notwithstanding
the
procedural
due
process
violation,
the
petitioner
failed
to
prove
any
actual
damages
flowing
from
the
procedural
due
process
violation.
there
can
be
any
of
a
number
of
reasons
why
that
is
so,
but
the
crucial
point
here
is
that
what
the
judgement
does
is
it
gives
us
a
judgment.
it
is
an
enforceable
judgment.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
justice.
and
certainly
if
i
had
said
we
want
procedural
due,
a
declaration
that
procedural
due
process
has
been
violated
and
nominal
damages--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--i
have
never
seen
a
case
that
is
a
declaration
of--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--i
believe
that
it
can.
yes,
an
appropriate
case,
i
think
that
it
can.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
do...
in
fact
i
think
that
is
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that
there
is
a
requirement
in
the
rules
of
equitable
relief
that
before
you
can
get
a
declaratory
judgment
there
must
be
some
showing
that
there
is
a
likelihood
of
repeat
in
the
future.
which
is
why
i
believe
the
court
says
in
carey
against
piphus
the
way
you
vindicate
procedural
due
process
violations
is
with
nominal
damages.
i
mean,
that's
the
vehicle.
that's
the
remedy
that
the
court
has
chosen
and
that
the
court
says
vindicates--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--it
is
vindication
to
say
that
this
individual
so
transgressed
the
constitutional
rights,
the
procedural
due
process
rights
of
the
petitioner
that
the
court
will
intervene
and
correct
it.
and
the
way,
the
court
will
say,
the
court
will
say
that
your
rights
were
violated.
now
the
court
won't
say
your
rights
were
violated
unless
there
is
a
real
concrete
dispute.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
the
court
said
your
right
to
a
hearing
has
been
violated.
in
the
same
sense
in
carey
against
piphus,
justice
scalia,
in
carey
against
piphus
we
talk
about
a
student
who
was
suspended
for,
i
have
forgotten,
20
days
or
something
like
that,
without
any
kind
of
a
prior
hearing,
for
passing
a
marijuana
cigarette
on
the
play
ground.
he
never
maintained
in
any
way
that
he
was
not
guilty
of
that.
he
never
maintained
that
had
he
had
a
hearing
that
the
result
would
have
been
different.
what
he
maintained
was
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
hearing
as
a
matter
of
procedural
due
process.
and
what
this
court
held
is,
of
course
it's
a
two-fold
hearing.
number
one
is
that
there
is
no
substantial
damages
that
you
can
recover
simply
because
your
procedural
due
process
rights
have
been
violated
without
a
showing
that
had
they
not
been
violated
there
would
have
been
a
different
result.
but
number
two,
so
long
as
you
make
that
minimum
showing
then
you
are
entitled
to
a
judgment
which
will
vindicate
the
loss
of
procedural
due
process
and
that
judgment
is
a
judgment
for
nominal
damages.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
well,
certainly
they
are,
justice
white,
and
certainly
that,
the
congressional
intent
i
think
in
this
circumstance
frankly
could...
well,
i
was
going
to
say--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--oh,
and
that
of
course
is
what
judge
hughes
says
in
his
opinion.
at
the
very
least
that
is
what
he
says.
and
that
brings
us
to
what
would
have
been
my
third
point
of
argument,
and
that
is
that
the
congressional
intent
clearly
was
to
encourage
private
attorneys
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
litigation
precisely
because
it
is
for
the
public
good
and
for
the
public
benefit.
now,
admittedly
under
hewitt,
justice
scalia,
that
in
and
of
itself
would
not
be
enough
to
carry
the
day.
what
is
the
threshold
that
gets
us
to
get
reasonable
fees,
whatever
reasonable
means
in
the
context
of
superimposing
the
recovery
upon
the
effort
that
was
expended
to
get
it.
we
got
the
judgment.
we
got
a
judgment
for
nominal
damages,
and
that
vindicates
the
constitutional
rights,
it
does
something,
it
is
some
benefit.
if
the
marshall
goes
out
to
execute
on
that
judgment
general
hobby
can't
say
wait
a
minute,
that
doesn't
count,
that's
only
a
technicality.
i
mean,
it
is
something
that
changes
the
legal
position
of
the
parties.
now
why
would
the
courts
say
you
do
that?
the
courts
don't
engage
in
meaningless
acts.
the
courts
don't
do
things
that
aren't
meaningful.
it
is
precisely
because
that
is
meaningful,
because
it
has
a
benefit,
and
because
it
is
substantial.
it
seems
to
me
that
where
this
case
gets
bogged
down
conceptually
is
in
our
failure
to
distinguish
between
the
qualitative
significance
of
the
judgment
and
the
quantitative
significance
of
it.
quantitatively
$1.00
is
not
necessarily
a
lot
of
money.
qualitatively
we
got
the
vindication
that
we
sought
in
that
we
got
a
judgment
that
said
our
procedural
due
process
rights
had
been
violated
and
for
that
we
were
entitled
to
the
relief
which
the
law
establishes,
namely
nominal
damages.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
address
that
very
last
point
first
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
try
to
clarify,
and
i
think
justice
scalia
was
particularly
interested
in
this.
the
specific
jury
question
about
the
compensatory
damages
was
this,
do
you
find
from
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
such
act
or
acts
were
a
proximate
cause
of
any
damages
to
plaintiff
joseph
davis
farrar.
now,
the
jury's
instructions,
the
court's
instructions
erroneously
described
proximate
cause
as
requiring
foreseeability
in
the
sense
that
governor
hobby
had
to
foresee
that
what
he
did
would
cause
the
type
of
results
that
they
caused.
so
the
explanation
in
this
particular
case
for
why
the
jury
found
a
lack
of
actual
damages
actually
goes
to,
and
this
was
litigated
in
the
courts
below,
the
erroneous
definition
of
foreseeability.
and
that
is
what
taints
that
whole
suggestion--
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
--that
is
correct,
and
that's
the
reason
the
appellate
court
didn't
address
it.
but
that
does
deprive
that
very
jury
instruction
of
its
significance.
mr.
gerald
m.
birnberg
then,
chief
justice,
i
shall
not
anymore.
i
shall
move
on
instead
to
the
next
point
which
is
i
wanted
to
correct
something
my
very,
that
mr.
cowan,
very
able
counsel,
but
i
think
he
may
be
confused
about
the
facts
of
hewitt
against
helms.
that's
the
one
he
said
was
the
on
all
fours
case.
well,
of
course
in
hewitt
against
helms,
and
it
starts
with
justice
scalia's
comment
about
the
fact
this
is
bizarre,
here
we
have
somebody
who
is
claiming
to
be
a
prevailing
party
who
had
never
won
anything
and
lost
the
judgment.
hewitt
against
helms
is
the
case
in
which
the
judgment
goes
against
the
plaintiff
on
qualified
immunity
grounds
and
the
plaintiff
actually
won
nothing
at
any
time
in
hewitt
against
helms
except
an
interlocutory
declaration
by
the
appellate
court
that
it
was
okay
for
him
to
maintain
his
lawsuit,
that
it
couldn't
be
dismissed
on
12(b)(6)
grounds.
that
certainly
is
not
anything
approaching
the
situation
here.
in
fact
we
have
got
exactly
the
opposite
here.
we've
got
a
case
here
in
which
the
plaintiff
in
fact
got
the
judgment
and
the
respondent
is
saying
nonetheless
he
is
not
the
prevailing
party.
it
seems
to
us
it's
the
flip
side
of
the
situation
that
was
presented
in
hewitt
against
helms.
i
had
started,
justice
o'connor,
addressing
the
two
phrases
are
de
minimis
and
technical,
and
i
think
i
had
addressed
the
de
minimis
issue
in
the
context
of
de
minimis
non
curat
lex.
technical,
there's
a
very
interesting
thing
about
all
of
the
cases
that
you
describe
in
that
opinion,
and
all
of
them
really,
in
which
you
suggest
that
these
might
be
examples
of
technical
victories.
and
every
technical
victory
has
this
common
thread.
they
are
all
cases
in
which
really
there
was
no
concrete
justiciable
controversy.
they
were
all
contrived
or
hypothetical
controversies,
such
as
there
was
the
footnote
that
referred
to
the
old
district
court
opinion
where
there
was
a
challenge
to
an
ancient
curfew
law.
nobody
had
threatened
prosecution
under
the
curfew
law.
yes,
they
won
a
finding
that
the
curfew
law
had
unconstitutional
aspects
to
it,
but
so
what,
nobody
was
threatened
under
that
law.
all
of
those
cases,
i
submit
to
the
court,
where
there
has
been
something
that
one
could
regard
as
a
technical
violation,
are
cases
in
which
in
point
of
fact
they
were
non
justiciable
to
begin
with.
the
tsta
v.
garland
has
the
example
of
the
one
part
of
the
regulation
that
none
of
the
teachers
had
ever
been
denied
permission
to
meet
pursuant
to,
never
expected
to
ask
that
that
particular
part
of
the
regulation
be
implication,
and
counsel
at
oral
argument
conceded
that
that
part
of
the
case
did
not
come
across
the
threshold.
it
was
a
hypothetical,
theoretical,
not
real
violation.
and
that's
really
the
difference
here.
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is,
and
i
think
this
is
the
threshold,
is
an
actual
deprivation,
one
that
the
jury
has
found
actually
occurred.
and
in
fact
the
jury
instruction,
it's
not
just
one,
it's
two
jury
questions
that
find
that.
the
one
that
we
have
referred
to
before
where
the
jury
found
that
hobby
committed
act
or
acts
under
color
of
law
that
deprived
the
plaintiff
of
civil
rights
guaranteed
by
the
constitution,
but
there
is
also,
and
i
think
this
is
a
significant
one,
the
very,
the
second
jury
question
asked
whether
hobby
was
entitled
to
qualified
immunity,
and
the
jury
found
that
he
was
not.
and
when
you
superimpose
that
upon
the
instructions
which
defined
qualified
immunity
you
will
find
that
the
qualified
immunity
instructions
required
them
to
find
that
he
knowingly
violated
a
constitutional
right,
knowing
that
he
had
done
wrong,
and
without
any
good
faith
or
other
extenuating
circumstances.
so...
i
see
the
red
light
is
on.
i
appreciate,
we
would
ask
the
court
that
this
judgment
be
reversed.
