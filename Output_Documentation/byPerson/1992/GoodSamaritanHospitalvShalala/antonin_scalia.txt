justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
hedlund,
you
would
give
the
secretary
this
much,
wouldn't
you,
you
would
say
that
if
you
come
up
with
an
accounting
methodology,
a
cost
accounting
methodology
that
shows
you
have
been
inadequately
reimbursed
but
the
secretary,
using
another
cost
accounting
methodology
which
is
also
reasonable,
finds
that
you
haven't
been
reimbursed,
and
both
methodologies
are
perfectly
respectable
ones,
you
lose?
you
won't
even
give
him
that
much?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
to
skin
the
cat,
and
economists
have
developed
a
lot
of
different
methodologies,
and
very
often
either
one
is
a
reasonable
methodology.
if
the
secretary
is
using
a
reasonable
methodology,
the
mere
fact
that
you
come
up
with
another
methodology,
which
is
also
reasonable,
that
shows
you've
been
inadequately
reimbursed,
that
would
not
entitle
you
to
compensation,
would
it?
that's
not
involved
in
this
case,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
just
trying
to
see
how
far
you're
trying
to
roll
over
the
secretary
here.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
in
a
section
entitled
"reasonable
costs".
justice
antonin
scalia
determination
of
amount.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dumont,
you
refer
to
the
cost
limits.
the
statute
does
not
refer
to
the
cost
limits,
does
it?
it
says
"the
reasonable
cost
of
any
services
shall
be
the
cost
actually
incurred.
"
these
are
cost
estimates,
rather
than
cost
limits,
aren't
they?
you're
referring
to
this
as
though
it's
a
price
regulation
scheme,
but
it
isn't,
is
it?
i
thought
it
was
just...
is
how
the
provision
begins.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
are
you...
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
clause
(ii)?
was
that
in
there
originally,
or
was
that
also
added?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dumont,
what
about
a
third
possibility,
besides
the
two
represented
by
the
government's
position
and
the
petitioners'
position
here?
clause
(ii)
says,
"provide
for
suitable
retroactive
corrective
adjustments
where
the
aggregate
reimbursement
provided
by
the
methods
of
determining
costs.
"
--methods
of
determining
costs...
"prove
inadequate
or
excessive",
and
if
you
go
back
earlier,
you'll
see
that
it
gives
the...
the
provision
gives
the
secretary
authority
to
do
various
things,
one
of
which
is
to
provide
for
the
determination
of
costs.
then
it
continues,
"he
may
also
provide
for
the
establishment
of
limits.
"
why
can't
they...
isn't
it
possible
that
this
provision
allows
them
to
question
the
determination
of
cost,
the
methodology
used
to
determine
cost,
but
not
to
determine
limits
that
have
been
established?
they
are
different
provisions.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
established
limits.
can
you
separate
out
the
two?
is
it
possible
to
decide
which
portion
of
the
secretary's
action
constitutes
determining
costs
and
which
constitutes
establishing
limits?
well,
doesn't
the
limit
itself
refer
to
costs,
though?
i
don't
think...
it
says
limits
on
costs.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
kind
of
determination?
i
didn't
hear
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
of
course,
aggregate
is
readily
explicable
on
the
other
theory
as
well.
that
is,
if
a
method
of
determining
certain
of
your
costs
inflate
your
costs,
but
a
method
of
determining
other
ones
deflate
your
costs,
you
shouldn't
be
able
to
claim
reimbursement.
you
can
offset
one
excess
against
the
other
deficiency.
it
makes
sense
on
that
basis,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
the
time
you
get
to
this
provision...
g
comes
before
x,
am
i
correct
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
at
least,
even
though
interim
payments
isn't
mentioned
in
this
section,
at
least
the
person
who
sat
down
of
an
evening
to
read
through
this
statute--
[laughter]
has
already
read
about
interim
payments
by
the
time
he
gets
to
this
provision,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
regulations
are
these,
ms.
hedlund?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
hedlund,
what
about
the...
what
is
your
response
to
the
question
that
i
asked
mr.
dumont?
suppose...
why
isn't
it
the
case
that
clause
(ii)
only
refers
to
adjustment
with
respect
to
methods
of
determining
costs,
and
that
is
separate
in
the
statute
from
the
establishment
of
limits
on
direct
or
indirect
costs.
would
it
suffice
for
your
purposes
if
you
had
the
power
to
challenge
the
method
of
determining
costs
but
not
the
power
to
challenge
the
establishment
of
limits
on
the
direct
or
indirect
overall
incurred
costs?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
response.
are
you
challenging
the
limits
in
this
suit,
or
are
you
challenging
just
the
methods,
or
both?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
challenge
both,
the
limits
and
the
methods,
you're
saying.
i
thought
you
were
challenging
neither.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
when
i
say
challenging--
justice
antonin
scalia
--when
i
say
challenging,
i
mean,
you're
saying
that
both
the
limits
and
the
methods
require
an
exception
in
your
case.
you
require
an
exception
from
both
the
limits
and
the
methods
in
order
to
get
reasonable
costs.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they'd
have
the
burden,
i
assume,
wouldn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
would
have
the
burden
of
showing
that
their
own
regulation
is
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
a
particular
case.
