justice
david
h.
souter
but
when
the
court
spoke
of
accuracy,
wasn't
it
talking
about
something
just
in
the
normal
meaning
of
those
terms
different
from
the
methodology,
and
isn't
the
suggestion
given
there
the
same
suggestion
that
is
given
by
the
three
final
words
in
the
statute
itself
which
refers
to
the
result
being
either
inadequate
or
excessive?
that
isn't
language
which
seems
to
call
into
question
the
methodology.
it
seems
to
be
language
that
assumes
that
there
is
a
comparatively
easy
way
of
finding
out
whether
a
particular
resolve,
a
particular
total,
if
you
will,
is
right
or
wrong,
and
if
that
is
so,
that
of
course
supports
the
government's
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
why
didn't
it
refer
to
unreasonably
high
or
unreasonably
low,
because
the
statute
doesn't
talk
about
adequacy
or
excessiveness,
it
talks
about
reasonable
cost.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
seems
to
say
two
different
things,
but
i
won't
stop
there.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that's
the
issue
in
the
case,
isn't
it?
is
it
the
methodology
which
is
subject
to
clause
(ii),
or
is
the
computation
of
results
under
the
methodology?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
simply
to
say
that
the
methodology
is
subject
to
clause
(ii)
it
seems
to
me
is
in
effect
to
assume
the
conclusion
that
you've
got
to
reach.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
and
the
question
is
whether
that
adequacy
or
inadequacy
is
to
be
reviewed
in
such
a
way
that
would
allow
a
departure
from
the
methodology,
or
whether
it
is
to
be
reviewed
in
such
a
way
as
to
provide,
in
effect,
a
final
year-end
computation
that
would
correct
any
cumulative
errors
from
the
monthly
instalment
reimbursement.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
is
there
any
administrative
procedure
for
doing
that
in
addition
to
or
apart
from
subsection...
the
regulations
that
are
mandated
by
subsection
(ii)?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that
is
so,
that
undercuts
your
argument
that
that
is
the
object
of
subsection
(2),
that
an
opportunity
to
litigate
the
inappropriateness
of
the
presumption
is
the
object
of
subsection
(2).
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
dumont,
this...
my
question
may
have
been
already
raised
by
someone
else
while
i
was
reading
the
statute,
and
i
apologize
if
it's
repetitive,
but
let
me
ask
you
this:
the
aggregate
reimbursement
which
is
either
inadequate
or
excessive
is
described
as
an
aggregate
reimbursement
produced
by
the
methods
of
determining
costs...
not
by
the
methods
of
deciding
how
interim
reimbursement
will
be
made,
not
by
the
methods
for
determining
payment,
but
by
the
methods
of
determining
costs.
doesn't
that
necessarily
mean
that
the
inadequacy
must
be
an
inadequacy
which
implies
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
the
method
itself?
justice
david
h.
souter
why?
i
mean,
explain
that
to
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
why
are
those
methods
for
determining
costs,
which
i
thought
meant
costs
in
the
allowable
sense
used
by
this
section,
which
is
kind
of
your
ultimate
determination,
or
ultimate
criterion
of
what
is
allowable?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
if
that...
and
in
a
way,
i
guess
that's
my
point.
the
statute
doesn't
speak
of
determining
adequacy...
inadequacy
or
excessiveness
by
reference
to
estimated
payments.
it's
inadequacy
or
excessiveness
by
methods
of
determining
costs,
which
seems
to
me
the
ultimate
criterion
rather
than
simply
the
procedure
for
making
interim
payments.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
aggregate
reimbursement
were
not
there,
would
you
agree
that
the
other
side
would
have
a
pretty
open-and-shut
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
boy,
you
won't
give
up
anything.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
they
ought
to
have
you
figuring
the
reimbursements.
[laughter]
but
if
you
didn't
have
that
phrase,
"the
aggregate
reimbursement",
then
you
would
simply
have
the
inadequacy
or
excessiveness...
let's
take...
leave
out
the
word
"aggregate".
you'd
just
have
inadequacy
or
excessiveness
or
reimbursement
produced
by
methods.
i
admit,
when
you
get
the
word,
"aggregate"
in
there,
maybe
you
introduce
an
ambiguity.
