ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
reasonable
cost
methodology
under
the
medicare
program.
under
that
provision,
the
secretary
is
to
reimburse
providers
for
their
reasonable
cost
of
providing
services
to
medicare
beneficiaries.
the
statute
defines
"reasonable
costs"
as
those
costs
actually
incurred,
excluding
therefrom
any
part
of
incurred
costs
found
to
be
unnecessary
in
the
efficient
delivery
of
needed
health
services.
the
statute
requires
the
secretary
to
do
two
things.
the
first
is,
it
authorizes
the
secretary
to
use
a
variety
of
methods
to
determine
a
provider's
reasonable
costs
in
the
first
instance,
and
then
in
clause
2
of
the
same
section,
it
requires
the
secretary
to
make
suitable
retroactive,
corrective
adjustments
for
individual
providers
when
the
methods
produce
inaccurate
results.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
what
kind
of
individual
retroactive
corrective
adjustments
does
clause
2
require?
are
they
adjustments
to
bring
an
individual
provider's
reimbursement
into
line
with
reasonable
cost
as
it's
defined
in
the
statute...
that
is,
actual
costs
excluding
those
due
to
unnecessary
services
or
to
inefficiency?
that
is
the
position
the
hospital
contends
that
clause
2
requires...
or
is
it
simply
an
adjustment
to
reconcile
the
interim
payments
the
provider
receives
during
the
year
with
the
amount
that
the
methods
say
that
you
get,
with
the
secretary's
regulatory
method?
in
this
case,
the
petitioners
are
six
rural
nebraska
hospitals.
prior
to
the
cost
years
under
appeal,
their
costs
were
always
under
the
medicare
cost
limit.
beginning
with
the
years
under
appeal,
however,
their
costs
exceeded
the
medicare
cost
limits
for
the
first
time.
the
hospitals
still
had
the
same
necessary
costs
that
they
had
in
prior
years.
the
record
shows
there
were
no
findings
that
the
hospitals
operated
inefficiently.
the
secretary
admitted
in
his
answer
to
the
complaint
that
the
cost
limits
for
areas
that
have
a
high
percentage
of
part-time
employment
is
artificially
low,
it
is
set
artificially
low,
and
yet
the
cost
limits
were
applied
in
this
case
to
disallow
a
substantial
portion
of
the
hospitals'
necessary
operating
costs.
the
secretary
applies
the
medicare
cost
limits
in
a
conclusive
fashion.
that
means
a
provider
cannot
be
reimbursed
for
costs
in
excess
of
the
cost
limits
even
if
the
provider
can
demonstrate
that
the
costs
are
reasonable
and
necessary
unless
the
provider's
costs
fall
within
one
of
a
very
few
narrow
exceptions
that
the
secretary
has
provided
for,
and
in
this
case
both
parties
agree
there
were
no
regulatory
exceptions
applicable
to
these
providers.
in
this
court,
we
are
not
challenging
the
validity
of
the
routine
cost-limit
methodology
as
a
general
rule.
we
are
saying
that
for
these
particular
providers
the
reimbursement
produced
by
the
secretary's
methods
was
inadequate
under
the
statutory
standard.
that
is,
it
failed
to
reimburse
the
provider's
actual,
necessary
costs,
excluding
those
costs
due
to
inefficiency
or
unnecessary
services,
and
what
the
hospitals
are
seeking
is
the
opportunity
to
show
that
their
costs
in
excess
limits
of
the
cost
limits
were
reasonable.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
i
believe
clause
(ii)
provides
that.
the
words
of
clause
(ii)
are
obviously
central
to
this
case,
and
they
say
that
the
secretary
shall
provide
for
the
making
of
a
suitable
retroactive
corrective
adjustment
where
for
a
provider
of
services
for
any
fiscal
period
the
aggregate
reimbursement
produced
by
the
methods
of
determining
costs
proves
to
be
inadequate
or
excessive.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
yes.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
and
they
say
it
doesn't.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
right.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
yes.
well,
if
you
look
at
this
court's
reading
of
the
plain
language
of
clause
(ii),
at
the
beginning
of
the
georgetown
decision
this
court
said
repeatedly--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--yes.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
on
page
472
in
the
supreme
court
reporter
the...
it
says,
"we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
clause
(ii)
directs
the
secretary
to
establish
a
procedure
for
making
case-by-case
adjustments
to
reimbursement
payments
where
the
regulations
prescribing
computation
methods
do
not
reach
the
correct
result
in
individual
cases.
"
that's
one
place.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
47...
i
have
the
supreme
court
copy
of
that.
i'm
sorry.
109
supreme--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--472.
it
goes
on
to
say
later,
on
that
same
page,
"these
adjustments
are
required
when
for
a
provider
the
aggregate
reimbursement
produced
by
the
methods
of
determining
costs
is
too
high
or
too
low.
"
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
again
on
that
page,
that
(ii)--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--thank
you
very
much.
it
says
that
clause
(ii),
rather
than
permitting
modification
to
the
cost
method
rules
and
their
general
formulation,
is
intended
to
authorize
case-by-case
inquiry
into
the
accuracy
of
reimbursement
determinations
for
individual
providers.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
well,
i
think
the
term
inadequate
or
excessive
in
the
statute
referred
back
to
the
first
sentence--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--but
it
discusses
the...
when
a
provider's...
when
the
reimbursement
methods
do
not
fully
take
into
account
the
provider's
actual,
reasonable
cost,
i
think
it
may
be
helpful
in
this
regard
to
go
back
to
some
of
the
legislative
history.
when
the
medicare
statute
was
created
in
1965,
congress
said
that
the
reasonable
cost
methodology
was
intended
to
reimburse
the
actual
costs
of
providers,
however
widely
they
vary
from
institution
to
institution,
except
where
they're
substantially
out
of
line
with
comparable
institutions,
and
it
gave
the
secretary
in
the
first
part
of
the
statute--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--it
gave
the
secretary
the
flexibility
to
use
a
variety
of
methods,
including
the
cost-limit
methods,
to
try
to
get
as
close
as
possible
to
reimbursing
what
a
provider's
actual
costs
were,
but
then
all
the
methods
are
subject
to
the
overriding
mandate
of
clause
(ii)
that
there
be
an
individual
retroactive
adjustment
when
those
methods
do
not
satisfy
the
statutory
standard
of
what
at
that
point
was
actual
cost.
in
1972,
congress
amended
the
statute
with
the
cost
limits.
it
put
into
the
definition
of
reasonable
costs
those
costs
actually
incurred
excluding
those
attributable
to
inefficiency
or
unnecessary
services,
and
when
it
added
the
cost-limit
authority
into
the
statute,
it
inserted
that
in
the
third
sentence
of
this
statute,
and
the
third
sentence
is
what
lays
out
all
the
variety
of
methods
the
secretary
could
use.
all
of
those
methods
remain
subject
to
clause
(ii),
which
is
an
individual
adjustment.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
if
the
methodology--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--what
we're
saying,
the
test
is
whether
the
individual
provider's
reimbursement...
not
the
method,
but
the
actual
money
that
goes
to
the
providers
is
excessive
or
inadequate
to
meet
the
statutory
standard.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
when
congress
enacted
the
cost
limit
in
1972,
it
very
clearly
says
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
cost
limits
were
to
be
presumptive,
and
that
costs
that
could
not
be
justified
by
providers
would
not
be
reimbursed.
the
reason
the
cost
limits
were
put
into
place,
congress
said,
is
it
recognized
that
intermediaries
were
having
a
very
difficult
time
identifying
which
costs
of
a
given
provider
were
too
high
and
explaining
why
they
were
too
high,
and
congress
decided
to
shift
the
burden
of
proof.
it
gave
the
secretary
the
authority
to
establish
cost
limits
that
were
going
to
be
presumptive
measures
of
reasonableness,
and
then
every
provider
if
it
felt
it
could
justify
the
reasonableness
of
its
costs
over
the
limits
would
be
able
to
do
so.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
the
secretary
has...
i
think
there
are
mechanisms
available,
regulatory
mechanisms
available.
the
secretary
has
not
implemented
them
to
do
so.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
i
think
actually
the
language
of
the
book-balancing
regulations
that
were
cited
in
the
georgetown
decision,
the
actual
language
of
the
regulations,
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
the
kind
of
adjustment
that
we
seek.
on...
it's
on
page
473
of
my
copy
of
the
decision,
the
language
of
the
book-balancing
regulation
that's
quoted
there
says
that
it's
supposed
to...
the
retroactive
adjustment
will
represent
the
difference
between
the
amount
received
by
the
provider
during
the
year
for
covered
services
and
the
amount
determined
in
accordance
with
a
method
of
cost
apportionment
to
be
the
actual
cost
of
services
rendered
to
beneficiaries
during
the
year.
cost
apportionment
is
just
a
mechanism
for
dividing
costs
between
medicare
patients
and
non-medicare
patients.
it's
not
a
method
of
determining
what
the
pot
of
costs
is
that
you're
talking
about,
and
the
wording
of
this
regulation
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
the
clause
(ii)
adjustment
that
we
seek.
it
has
not
been
implemented
that
way
by
the
secretary.
one
of
the
other
book-balancing
regulations
that
the
secretary
cites
in
their
brief
on
page
21...
it's
the
regulation
at
405.405(c)...
talks
about
the
retroactive
adjustments.
it
says,
"the
retroactive
payments
will
take
fully
into
account
the
costs
that
were
actually
incurred.
"
that
language
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
the
kind
of
adjustment
that
we're
seeking
under
clause
(ii),
but
they
have
not
been
implemented
in
that
fashion
by
the
secretary.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
i
don't
think
that
the
exhaustion...
excuse
me,
the
exception
regulations
comply
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
because
the
statute
says
there
shall
be
a
retroactive
adjustment
for
a
provider
for
any
fiscal
period.
it
doesn't
say,
for
some
providers.
it
doesn't
say,
those
providers
that
the
secretary
may
choose
to
have--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--if
the
exception's
regulations
perhaps
had
had
another
provision
in
it
that
it
would
allow
providers
to
appeal
to
demonstrate
that
their
costs
over
the
cost
limits
were
reasonable,
for
whatever
reason,
that
would
do
it,
but
they
haven't
done
that.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
i
don't
think
that
satisfies
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
which
is
for
a
provider
for
any
fiscal
period.
i
think
any
provider
needs
to
be
given
that
opportunity
to
demonstrate
that
its
costs
are
reasonable
under
the
statutory
standard.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
i'm
not
sure
i
fully
understand--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--it's
not.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
i
think
that
the
statute...
we're
not
challenging
the
methodology,
so...
the
statute
says
when
any
methodology,
when
the
aggregate
reimbursement
produced
by
all
the
methodologies
is
inadequate
under
that
statutory
standard--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--we
need
to
go
through
a
system
of
proof.
that's
what
we
would
like
to
do,
and--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--the
test
of
reasonableness
is
one
that's
been
used
a
very
long
time
in
medicare.
it
derives
from
the
1965
legislative
history
that
i
said
before,
which
is
that
it's
to
reimburse
costs
however
widely
they
vary,
except
where
they
are
substantially
out
of
line
with
costs
of
comparable
providers.
and
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board
right
now
hears
cases
all
the
time
where
the
issue
is,
was
a
particular
cost
of
a
provider
reasonable,
and
the
level
of
proof
the
provider
has
to
meet
is
to
show
that
its
costs
were
comparable,
or
substantially
in
line
with
costs
of
comparable
providers,
and
that
kind
of
exercise
goes
on
all
the
time
at
the
provider
reimbursement
review
board,
so
we're
not
seeking
some
kind
of
new
methodology
by
which
to
prove
that
the
costs
are
reasonable.
with
respect
to
the
secretary's
book-balancing
interpretation,
if
you
step
back
and
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
kinds
of
retroactive
adjustment
required.
one
is
required
for
every
provider,
every
year,
and
that
is
the
kind
of
reconciliation
the
secretary
does,
and
we
contend
that
that
reconciliation
is
governed
by
section
1395(g).
1395(g)
is
the
section
that
provides
for
interim
payments
to
providers
throughout
the
year,
and
then
it
requires
that
there
be
necessary
adjustments
on
account
of
overpayments
or
underpayments,
and
that
those
adjustments
should
be
made
prior
to
settlement
of
the
cost
report.
that
final
adjustment
that
takes
place
prior
to
settlement
of
the
cost
report
is
exactly
what
the
secretary's
book-balancing
interpretation
does
in
this
case.
that's
all
that
the
secretary
says
they
should
do,
and
we
contend
that
that
is
entirely
covered
under
section
1395(g).
if
you
look
at
clause
(ii),
the
language
of
clause
(ii)
says
it
requires
an
adjustment
for
a
provider,
for
any
fiscal
period.
it
doesn't
say,
every
provider
for
every
period.
that
language
in
clause
(ii)
does
not
contemplate
an
adjustment
for
every
provider
every
year.
it's
not
the
book-balancing
that's
governed
by
section
1395g.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
that's
correct,
as
opposed
to
the
other
reconciliation
method--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--determination
of
payment
amount.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
1395g--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--i
think
there's
retroactive--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--it
says--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--my
reading
of
section
1395g
is
that
when
it
says,
with
necessary
adjustments
on
account
of
previously
made
overpayments
or
underpayments,
that's
sort
of
a
retroactive
settling
up.
a
provider
gets
interim
payments
throughout
the
year.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
but
it's
also
on
a
year-to-year
basis,
because
those
necessary
adjustments
also
are
made
prior
to
settlement.
this
section
says
its
made
prior
to
settlement
of
the
cost
report.
so
there
are
interim
payments
made
throughout
the
year.
when
a
provider
files
its
cost
report
there
is
often
what's
called
a
tentative
settlement
that's
made...
that's
the
preliminary
reconciliation...
and
then
when
the
cost
report
is
finally
settled,
there's
the
final
reconciliation,
and
i
think
this
language
on
account
of
previously
made
underpayments
or
overpayments
is
taken
into
account
in
that
final
settlement
process.
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
i
don't
think
it's
superfluous,
because
it...
you
have
to
wait
till
all
the
regulations
are
applied
at
the
end
of
the
year
before
clause
(ii)
kicks
in.
it's
a
retroactive
adjustment,
and
you
look
at
all
the
reimbursement
produced
by
all
the
secretary's
methods.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
yes,
i
believe
that's
correct.
the
secretary
indicated
that
his
book-balancing
regulations
should
be
entitled
to
deference
because
they
were
the
original
regulations
developed
at
the
beginning
of
the
medicare
program,
but
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
point
i
made
earlier,
which
is
the
language
in
those
regulations
talks
about
an
adjustment
that
brings
reimbursement
into
line
with
actual
cost.
that's
not
what
the
secretary
has
done
in
our
case,
but
that's
what
the
language
of
the
regulation
said.
congress
probably
understood
those
words
to
encompass
the
kind
of
adjustment
that
we're
seeking,
but
they've
simply
not
been
applied
by
the
secretary
in
that
fashion.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
the
one
cited
in
footnote
2
of
the
georgetown
decision.
both
of
them
are
actually
cited
on
page
21
of
the
government's
brief,
405.405(c),
which
talks
about
the
retroactive
payments
will
take
fully
into
account
the
costs
that
were
actually
incurred,
and
405.451(b)(1).
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
we
did
challenge
the
validity
of
the
cost-limits
methods,
and
we
lost
on
that
challenge,
and
we're
saying
clause
(ii)
assumes
or
recognizes
that
valid
methods
can
produce
inaccurate
reimbursement
in
individual
circumstances,
so
we...
it's
not
sufficient
for
our
purpose
to
be
able
to
challenge
the
cost-limit
method.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
the
limits
are
a
method.
we're
challenging
the
amount
of
reimbursement
that
we
were
paid
under
the
limits.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
in
this
case,
we're...
i'm
confused
by
the
question--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--because
the
cost
limits
are
one
of
the
methods--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--yes.
i
think
the
limits
are
one
of
the
methods,
and
that's
the
way
this
court
construed
it
in
georgetown.
with
respect
to
the
question
about,
how
would
the
secretary
recapture
excessive
reimbursement,
because
clause
(ii)
is
definitely
a
two-way
street,
i
would
just
note
that
in
the
past
the
secretary
has
cited
clause
(ii)
to
promulgate
regulations
to
go
back
and
take
depreciation
from
providers
in
the
depreciation
recapture
cases...
it's
the
springdale
convalescent
center
case
out
of
the
fifth
circuit...
when
the
secretary
has
invoked
clause
(ii)
for
a
variety
of
reasons
over
the
years.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
if
the
secretary
could
prove
that
they
had
paid
more
than
the
actual
cost
to
a
provider,
they
could
do
that
under
clause
(ii).
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
not
just...
well,
not
just...
i
think
that's
different,
if
it's
an
accounting
question
as
to
whether
they
didn't
properly--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--the
costs
were
properly
recorded--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--i'm
sure
of
that.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
clause
(ii)
works
two
ways.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
it
is
a
two-edged
sword.
it
definitely
is
a
two-edged
sword.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
they
would
have
the
burden
of
showing--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--that's
correct,
or
that
it
resulted
in
over-reimbursement,
or
that
the
provider's
costs
were
unreasonable.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
in
a
particular
case.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
yes.
with
respect
to
the
secretary's
assertion
that
remand
for
rulemaking
might
be
an
appropriate
remedy,
we
don't
think
that
that's
the
case.
as
i
said,
the
actual
language
of
the
book-balancing
regulations...
not
the
way
they've
been
implemented,
but
the
language
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
the
kind
of
adjustment
we're
seeking,
and--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--of
the
regulations,
the
book-balancing
regulations,
where
it
talks
about
a
reconciliation
to
actual
cost,
that
that...
clause
(ii)
does
require
regulation.
that
regulation...
the
book-balancing
regulation,
the
actual
language
is
broad
enough
and
in
addition--
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
--they've
been
applying
them...
they've
not
allowed
us
to
show...
to
get
reimbursement
for
our
actual
costs.
they
have
always
construed
that
regulation
far
more
narrowly
than
the
language
in
that
regulation.
ms.
carel
t.
hedlund
misapplied
it,
i
believe.
