mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
in
this
case
were
subject
to
exactly
the
same
regulatory
cost
limits
that
applied
to
all
similar
medicare
providers
during
the
years
at
issue.
their
costs
exceeded
those
limits,
and
they
concede
that
they
did
not
qualify
for
any
of
the
exemptions
or
exceptions
provided
in
the
secretary's
regulations.
in
the
courts
below,
petitioners
challenged
the
validity
of
the
regulatory
cost
limits,
saying
that
they
were
arbitrary
and
irrational.
they
lost
that
challenge,
and
in
this
court
they
concede
that
the
regulatory
cost
limits
are
generally
valid.
nevertheless,
they
assert
a
right
to
some
sort
of
individualized
proceeding
in
which
to
seek
exactly
the
same
relief
on
the
ground
that
those
limits,
although
generally
valid,
should
not
apply
to
them.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
how
the
provision
begins,
and
that's
how
the
provision
stood
in
1965
when
it
was
enacted,
but
in
1972,
congress
explicitly
enacted
authority
later
on
in
the
same
section
of
the
statute
for
the
secretary
to
provide
for
the
establishment
of
limits
on
the
direct
or
indirect
overall
incurred
costs
to
be
recognized
as
reasonable
for
purposes
of
medicare
reimbursement,
and
we
submit
that
that
language
is
essentially
conclusive
of
the
issue
presented
in
this
case.
in
fact,
there
are
three
principal
reasons--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i'm
sorry,
i'm
reading...
i'm
in
section
1395x(v)(1)(a)
about
in
the
middle
of
the--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--using
the
copy
of
the
statute
that's
at
the
beginning
of
the
petitioners'
brief,
it's
almost
at
the
bottom
of
page
2
of
the
petitioners'
brief.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
in
fact,
we
would
assert
that
there
are
three
principal
reasons
why
this
court
should
not--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
language...
first
of
all,
section
1861
provides
the
definition
of
reasonable
cost,
which
is
the
key
to
medicare
reimbursement
entirely.
it
provides
that
that
reasonable
cost
means
necessary
cost
incurred,
and
so
on--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--and
is
to
be
determined
by
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary
specifying
the
methods
to
be
used
in
calculating
reasonable
cost.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the...
in
1972,
congress
enacted
a
specific
authorization
for
a
particular
method.
that
is,
the
cost
limits
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that
entire
sentence
was
not
added,
but
the
authorization
that
it
may
provide
for
establishment
of
limits
was
added
in
1972.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
clause
(ii)
has
been
there
since
the
beginning
of
the
statute.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
yes.
the
language
of
clause
(ii)
has
not
changed
except
to
change
b
to
(ii)
when
they
reordered
the
numbering
in
the
statute.
we
would...
we
think
the
petitioners
focus
on
clause
(ii),
which
defines
reasonable
cost,
but
as
i've
been
saying,
the
immediately
preceding
sentence
of
the
same
section
explicitly
authorizes
the
secretary
first
of
all
to
make
estimates
of
the
costs
necessary
in
the
efficient
delivery
of
needed
health
services,
which
is
the
language
which
ms.
hedlund
refers
to,
and
then,
on
the
basis
of
those
estimates,
to
promulgate
limits
on
the
costs
to
be
recognized
as
reasonable.
if
there's
a
key
point
in
this
case,
it
is
that
when
the
secretary
prescribes
a
valid
cost
limit,
which
is
to
be
recognized
as
reasonable,
that,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
authority,
pretermits
any
further
inquiry
into
whether
a
the
valid
application
of
those
methods
produces
a
result
which
is
reasonable
or
not.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
language
suggests...
you
know,
mandates
that
there
must
be
some
adjustment
and
there's
going
to
be
some
comparison
of
aggregate
amounts.
we
would
submit
that
the
language,
"inadequate
or
excessive"
at
the
end
of
the
statute
begs
the
immediate
question,
inadequate
or
excessive
compared
to
what?
now,
compared
to
what
has
to
be
reasonable
cost,
as
defined
in
the
statute,
but
reasonable
cost
is
not
self-defining
in
the
statute.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
certainly
agree
that
if
clause
(ii)
requires
anything
more
than
we
say
it
does,
which
is
to
say,
year-end
reconciliation,
then
whatever
obligation
it
imposes
on
the
secretary
is
first
of
all
qualified
by
the
words
"suitable
retroactive
corrective
adjustments"
which
implies
a
certain
range
of
discretion,
and
second
is
fully
accounted
for
by
the
exceptions
and
exemptions
that
the
secretary
has
in
fact
built
into
the
cost
limits.
now,
i
should
be
clear
that
we
do
not
think
those
exemptions
or
exceptions
were
promulgated
under
the
authority
of
clause
(ii)
because
we
don't
think
that
is
what
clause
(ii)
is
about.
now,
with
respect
to
section
1395g,
with
respect
i
think
the
two
statutory
provisions
really
look
at
different
phases
of
the
process
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
section
1395g
is
a
payment
mechanism,
and
if
you
look
at
the
beginning
of
section
1395g,
which
i
believe
is
quoted
on
page
20
of
petitioners'
brief
in
note
17,
the
beginning
of
that
section
is,
"the
secretary
shall
periodically
determine
the
amount
which
should
be
paid
under
part
a
to
each
provider
of
services.
"
and
so
on.
now
that
refers
to
something
obviously
as
outside
of
section
1395g
itself
as
to
the
substantive
determination
of
how
much
is
to
be
paid,
and
we
submit
that
what
it
refers
to
is
the
secretary's
cost
determination
methods
which
are
in
fact
specified
in
section
1395x(v).
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
think
that's
a
very
interesting
question,
your
honor,
and
in
fact--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
no,
your
honor,
in
fact
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
be.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
first
of
all,
i
think
that
is
by
far
the
most
natural
interpretation
of
the
statute,
is
that
that
language
refers
to
the
same
kind
of
accounting
comparison
that
we
submit,
the
comparison
of
an
aggregate
reimbursement
produced
by
estimated
methods
with
a
total
final
audited
reimbursement
produced
by
the
same
methods
but
applied
to
final
numbers.
now,
your
honor
does
raise
an
interesting
point,
however,
which
is
that
in
the
context
of
this
particular
clause,
what's
sauce
for
the
goose
has
to
be
sauce
for
the
gander,
so
that
if
in
fact
clause
2
provides
for
some
kind
of
retroactive
change
in
the
methods
which
are
applied,
then
there's
no
reason
why
the
secretary
couldn't
come
in
and
say...
because
as
justice
scalia
said,
there's
a
variety
of
reasonable
methods
that
could
be
applied
to
determining
costs.
there's
no
reason
the
secretary
couldn't
come
xx
at
some
point
and
say
well,
you
know,
i
know
i
promulgate
these
regulations
that
said
that
x
was
reasonable,
but
now
i
really
think
that
it
should
have
been
x
minus
10
and
i'm
going
to
apply
that
on
a
case-by-case
adjudication
to
every
provider
in
the
medicare
program
with
an
open
year,
and
provided
that
those...
both
x
and
x
minus
10
are
reasonable
within
some
broad
unstructured
definition,
i
assume
the
secretary
gets
away
with
that.
i
mean,
that
seems
to
me
to
directly
undercut
this
court's
holding
in
bowen
v.
georgetown
university
hospital.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
would
agree
with
you
that
even
if
clause
(ii)
had
originally
allowed
for
some
kind
of
originalized
challenge
to
the
determination
of
costs
under
the
original
statutory
scheme,
that
once
congress
came
in
in
1972
and
spoke
very
specifically
to
the
concept
of
imposing
costs--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
we
would
submit
that
the
cost
limits
are,
in
fact,
one
of
the
methods
of
determining
costs.
i
mean,
that
is
our
position.
i
think
it
is
possible
technically
to
separate
them
in
the
sense
that
in
order
to
calculate...
the
provider
comes
forward
with
a
report
of
what
it's
costs
were,
and
these
limits
are
actually
implemented
through
a
per
diem
schedule,
depending
where
a
hospital
fits
in
terms
of
size
and
location
and
so
on.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
would
submit
that
no,
it
could
not,
because
after
all,
clause
(ii)
only
authorizes
an
adjustment
in
accordance
with
the
methods
prescribed
by
the
secretary,
and
cost
limits
are
one
of
those
methods,
so
once
you
have
a
validly
promulgated
applicable
limit,
we
think
that
ends
the
question
as
to
those
costs.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
first
of
all,
because,
as
i
said
the...
we
think
1395g
refers
only
to
a
payment
mechanism
and
that
the
first
sentence
of
1395g
requires
an
external
determination
of
what
amounts
are
in
fact
due
under--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--external,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
external
to
the
standards
put
forth
in
1395g
itself.
secondly,
because
as
a
matter
of
interpretation,
if
you
look
at
how
both
1395g
and
clause
(ii)
were
implemented
in
the
initial
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary,
it's
quite
clear
that
clause
(ii),
as
this
court
said
in
footnote
2,
i
believe,
of
the
georgetown
opinion,
the
language
of
clause
(ii)
is
tracked
quite
directly
by
the
year-end
reconciliation
language
in
the
initial
regulations.
and
we
would
submit
that
those
regulations
being...
having
been
drafted
by
people
who
were
intimately
involved
in
putting
together
the
statute
and
having
been
really
discussed
with
the
enacting
congress
before
they
were
promulgated,
so
it
was
an
excellent
guide
to
the
original
understanding
of
the
terms
of
the
statute
were.
so
if
those
regulations
implement
clause
(ii)
in
a
substantive
provision
providing
for
retroactive
reconciliation
and
book-balancing
at
the
end
of
the
year,
then
we
think
that's
very
good
evidence
that
that's
what
that
clause
was
intended
to
do.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
no,
your
honor,
for
the
following
reason.
the
language
methods
of
determining
costs
in
clause
(ii)
is
fully
broad
enough
to
include
the
application
of
those
methods
in
making
the
estimates
that
are
made
in
order
to
make
interim
payments
as
directed
by
section
1395g.
it's
really
the
same--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
you
need
to
have
some
basis
on
which
to
make
estimated
payments,
since
the
statute
directs
that
you
make
them
at
least
monthly.
now,
the
regulatory
direction
is
to
make
those
estimates
as
close
as
possible
to
what
the
final
result
is
going
to
be.
therefore,
what
you're
really
doing
is
taking
estimated
data
but
running
them
through
the
same
methods
that
you're
eventually
going
to
run
the
final
data
through
in
order
to
get
a
result.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
that's
quite
right,
but
you
pay
on
an
estimated
basis
your
best
estimate
of
what
those
allowable
costs
are
going
to
be.
then
you're
going
to
inevitably
make
some
mistakes
that
will
be--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--with
respect,
it's
inadequacy
or
excessiveness
of
an
aggregate
reimbursement
produced
by
the
methods
of
determining
costs,
and
we
would
say
that
aggregate
reimbursement
is
most
naturally
interpreted
to
be
a
reference
to
the
total
bottom-line
number
you
get
at
the
end
of
the
year
once
you've
made
a
bunch
of
estimated
payments.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
still--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--we're
trained
that
way.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
that's
true,
but
i
think
even
without
the
word
"aggregate",
you
are
talking
about
a
reimbursement
produced
by
applying
the
secretary's
methods,
and
those
methods
are...
the
same
methods
are
applied
in
determining
the
estimated
payments
made
during
the
course
of
the
year.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
the
word
is
susceptible
to
a
variety
of
interpretations,
but
actually
i
would
urge
that
ours
is
the
more
natural,
for
this
reason:
that
because
you're
going
to
have...
you
know
you're
going
to
have
a
number
of
interim
payments
which
are
frankly
estimates,
and
you
know
they're
going
to
be
somewhat
inaccurate,
some
may
be
high,
some
may
be
low,
you're
going
to
get
to
the
end
of
the
year
and
you're
going
to
have
an
aggregate
number
you've
actually
paid.
whereas
on
their
theory,
it
seems
to
me
what
they're
really
saying
is
that
they're
really
attacking
the
method
in
the
sense
that
they're
saying
that
the
cost
limits
as
we've
promulgated
them
are
unfair
to
them
as
we
have
placed
them
on
a
matrix
of
possible
places
you
could
be
on
the
cost-limit
curve,
and
these
are
per
diem
limits,
so
their
argument
applies
exactly
the
same
way
to
every
patient
day
of
care
during
the
entire
year.
it
gives
you
a
determinate
amount,
and
all
you
have
to
do
to
aggregate
anything
there
is
to
add
up
the
total
number
of
patient
days
and
multiply,
and
i
think
it's
a
much
less
substantial
reading
of
the
word
"aggregate",
actually,
than
ours.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
think
that
if
clause
(ii)
did
not
exist,
it's
likely
or
at
least
possible
that
the
authority
to
form
some
kind
of
year-end
book-balancing
could
be
inferred
under
the
general
statutory--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
suspect
that
we
would
argue
that
the
secretary
would
have
that
power.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
to
return
for
a
moment
to
mr.
justice
souter's
question,
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
there
is
a
tautology
involved,
we
think,
in
clause
(ii),
which
is
to
say
that
the
costs
you're
going
to
compare
have
to
be
costs
that
are
determined
by
the
secretary's
methods,
and
you're
going
to
compare
them
to
some
standard
of
reasonableness,
but
as
we
also
say,
the
standard
of
reasonableness
is
the
standard
that
is
produced
by
the
secretary's
methods.
now,
our
interpretation
accommodates
that
tautology,
because
we're
not
talking
about
changing
the
methods,
we
are
only
talking
about
changing
the
data,
because
the
data
when
you
originally
make
payments
are
estimated
and
provisional,
and
the
data
when
you
eventually
make
final
settlement
are
audited
and
correct.
now,
petitioners'
interpretation,
on
the
other
hand,
really
destroys
that
tautology
because
they
have
to
be
in
a
position
of
saying,
well,
what
you
compare
this
to
is
some
general
and
rather
amorphous
statutory
standard
of
reasonableness,
which
first
of
all
we
think
is
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
language--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--there's
a
factual
question
when
they
prove
their
actual
costs.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
there's
a
much
more
complicated
question
when
they
prove
their
reasonable
costs.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
presumably,
yes.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct,
but
again,
the
question--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
believe
on
their
theory
you
would
have
to
show
that
it
was
unreasonably
low
compared
to
some
statutory
standard
of
reasonableness.
now,
ms.
hedlund
has
tried
to
reimport
into
that
analysis
the
original
regulatory
standard,
which
was
substantially
out
of
line
with
the
costs
of
other
similar
providers,
but
frankly
i
don't
know
why
she
would
make
that
concession,
because
once
she's
outside
of
the
secretary's
methods,
one
of
which
is
cost
limits
and
another
one
of
which
is
the
substantially-out-of-line
standard,
you're
really
back
to
a
completely
unbounded
statutory
question
of
whether
a
particular
reimbursement
is
reasonable
within
only
the
statutory
definition.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
and
first
of
all
we
believe
that
clause
(ii)
has
been
implemented
by
regulations
which
date
back
to
the
initiation
of
the
program
in
the
limited
way
in
which
we
interpret
it,
and
second,
even
if
clause
(ii)
means
something
else
from
what
we
think
it
means,
presumably
the
only
appropriate
remedy
is
to
remand
to
the
secretary
for
promulgation
of
some
kind
of
regulations
to
implement
that
standard
with
suitable
adjustments
and
suitable
limitations.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct,
your
honor.
just
to
recap
for
a
moment.
petitioners
challenge
the
reasonableness
and
validity
of
the
regulations--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--under
clause
(ii),
assuming
that
the
regulations
have
been
properly
applied,
no,
we
would
not
be
entitled
that
under
clause
(ii).
now,
there
might
very
well
be
some
general
common
law
recoupment
power
if
we
had
double-paid
for
a
particular
cost.
but
under
clause
(ii),
no.
clause
(ii)
does
not
speak
to
that
issue.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
assume
it
would,
yes.
we
believe
the
result
the
petitioners
seek
would
contravene
the
statutory
language
enacted
in
1972
specifically
authorizing
cost
limits,
undermine
the
whole
concept
of
cost
limits,
and
a
sensible
and
generally
applicable
scheme
in
favor
of
case-by-case
adjudication,
essentially
without
standards,
undercut
the
results
of
this
court's
decision
in
georgetown,
and
impose
an
unacceptable
burden
on
the
secretary
and
ultimately
on
the
courts.
thank
you,
your
honor.
