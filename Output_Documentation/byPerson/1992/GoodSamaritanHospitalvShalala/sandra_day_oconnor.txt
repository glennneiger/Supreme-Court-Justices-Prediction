justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
hedlund,
even
if
you're
correct
that
clause
(ii)
requires
more
than
book-balancing
and
is
some
kind
of
escape
valve
for
the
hospitals,
even
so,
doesn't
that
leave
hhs
with
some
discretion
as
to
how
to
implement
that
provision
in
clause
(ii)?
and
the
secretary
has
promulgated
regulations
providing
for
a
scheme
of
exceptions
to
the
cost-limit
rules
and
has
spelled
out
the
circumstances
where
the
secretary
is
going
to
allow
adjustments.
why
isn't
that
a
valid
exercise
of
any
duty
that
hhs
may
have
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position,
then,
that
hhs
can't
meet
any
requirement
that
may
exist
there
by
the
adoption
of
reasonable
rules
and
regulations,
rather
than
dealing
with
it
as
you
propose
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
don't
think
the
secretary
can
say,
here
are
the
reasons
that
we
are
going
to
take
account
of?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i...
the
concern,
though,
is
that
here
the
statute
spells
out
how
the
secretary
is
going
to
determine
the
calculation
of
reasonable
costs,
but
then
subsection
(ii),
the
clause
on
which
petitioners
rely,
says
that
where
the
aggregate
reimbursement
made
by
these
methods
of
determining
reasonable
cost
proves
to
be
either
inadequate
or
excessive,
that
some
adjustment
will
be
made,
and
that
suggests
at
least
that
it's
more
than
just
going
through
the
reasonable
cost
analysis.
i
mean,
the
language
would
suggest
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there's
another
statutory
provision,
i
think
that
requires
the
book-balancing,
so
clause
(ii)
must
mean
something
else.
i
mean,
there's
another
statute,
i
think--
--1395g.
1395g,
that
says
you're
going
to
do
the
book-balancing,
so
i
think
probably
it's
reasonable
to
read
subsection
(ii)
as
requiring
something
more.
i
get
bogged
down
in
what
the
something
more
might
be
and
how
the
secretary
could
do
it.
i
mean,
maybe
the
secretary
can
do
the
something
more
in
the
very
way
the
secretary
has,
by
providing
exceptions
here
and
there.
they
have
regulations
that
deal
with
many
of
these
things.
