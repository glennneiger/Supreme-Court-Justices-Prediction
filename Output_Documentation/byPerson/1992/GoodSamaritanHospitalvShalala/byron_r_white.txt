justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
the
statute
expressly
provides
it
in
that
final
provision.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
assert
that
the
georgetown
opinion
supports
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
opponent--
justice
byron
r.
white
--they
say
it
doesn't,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
say
it
supports
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
a
page
number
in
the
georgetown
case
that
you
think
supports
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
on
page
472.
justice

109
supreme
court--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
are
you
going
to
prove
that
you've
been
inadequately
compensated
without
going
through
some
system
of
proof?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
it
might
be
quite
reasonable,
but
the
secretary's
is,
too,
as
justice
scalia
suggests.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
that
particular
language.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
the
secretary
has
determined
the
compensation
for
this
provider
under
his
prescribed
methodology--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
take
it.
now,
clause
(ii)
provides...
speaks
not
only
of
inadequacy
but
of
excessiveness.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
how
would
the
secretary
ever
go
about
saying
that
what
we
have
paid
is
excessive,
even
though
our
methodology
says
that's
supposed
to
reflect
cost?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
almost
impossible,
wouldn't
it,
for
the
secretary
to
confound
his
own
methodology?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i'm
just
suggesting
to
you
that
maybe
excessiveness
could
only
really
mean
book-balancing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose...
he's
imposed
a
limit
of...
imposed
limits
on
costs
of
specific
items
or
services
or
groups
of
items
or
services.
clause
(ii)
couldn't
possibly
provide
for
reimbursement
beyond
those
cost
limits,
could
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
some
problem
about
the
provider
proving
what
their
actual...
what
its
actual
costs
were
for
the
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand
that,
but
there's
no
problem
they
can
prove
what
they
paid
out...
i
mean,
what
it
actually
cost
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
presumably...
i
would
suppose
they
could.
and
i
thought,
maybe
(ii)
says
you
compare
what
they
got
under
the
program
with
what
it
cost
them
and
try
to
determine
whether
what
they
got
is
inadequate.
that's
what
(ii)
says...
inadequate
or
excessive.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then...
and
in
order
to
show
they
were
inadequate,
you
would
have
to
show
that
the
compensation
was
unreasonably
low.
