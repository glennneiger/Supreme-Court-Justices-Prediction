we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-2079,
good
samaritan
hospital
v.
donna
e.
shalala.
ms.
hedlund,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
hedlund.
mr.
dumont,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see.
now,
would
you
be
more
specific
where
you
are
in
1395x(v)(1)(a)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
referent
of
subsection
(ii)
that
we've
been
talking
about
is
such
regulations,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
give
any
independent
right
to
simply
come
in
and
challenge
the
inadequacy
of...
it
directs
the
secretary
to
come
up
with
regulations
dealing
with
the
subject.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dumont.
ms.
hedlund,
you
have
8
minutes
remaining.
ms.
hedlund,
as
part
of
your
presentation
at
any
point,
it
seems
to
me
that
under
your
interpretation
the
word
"aggregate"
is
simply
superfluous.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
mean
the
language
of
g
is
broad
enough,
or
the
language
of
x
is
broad--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
you
say
the
secretary
has
just
misinterpreted
his
own
regulation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
secretary
has
misconstrued
his
regulation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
thank
you,
ms.
hedlund.
the
case
is
submitted.
