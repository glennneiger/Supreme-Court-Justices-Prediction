before
you
leave
that
section,
would
you
just...
i'm
a
little
slow
in
following
this
rather
complicated
statute.
what
in
that
sentence
is
it
that's
so
critical
and
disposes
of
the
whole
case,
which
i
think
you
said
that
sentence
did?
you
better
tell
me
which
language
does
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
is
that
the
sentence
that
begins,
'72?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
follow
up
with
one
other
question?
supposing
congress
repealed
clause
(ii),
would
you
say
that
there
would
no
longer
be
any
statutory
authority
for
book-balancing
pursuant
to
subsection
g?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
rather
clear
they
would
be
able...
if
they
found
they
paid
$10,000
too
much
just
because
they
overestimated,
it's
pretty
clear
they
could
have
balanced
just
at
the
end
of
the
year,
couldn't
they,
without
clause
(ii)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
a
fair
summary
of
what
you
say
it
means:
"provided
that
where,
at
the
end
of
the
year,
the
provider
has
received
either
more
or
less
than
the
regulations
authorize,
there
shall
be
a
corrective
adjustment?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
the
secretary
could
invoke
clause
(ii),
saying
to
recapture
a
lot
of
depreciation
he
thought
was
excessive,
without
promulgating
a
regulation...
just
say,
we
just
realized
there's
this
method,
that
one
of
the
consequences
of
our
regulations
is
that
these
hospitals
have
been
able
to
make
all
sorts
of
money
because
they've
overestimated
or
overaccounted
for
depreciation,
something
like
that.
isn't
it
an
open-ended,
ad
hoc
thing?
you
just
made
too
much
money,
ergo
it
was
excessive,
ergo
we
can
on
a
case-by-case
method
recover
some
money
from
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
without
a
special
regulation
on
depreciating,
just
doing
an
accurate
accounting
job
by--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
are
all
sorts
of
cost
accountants
who
can
figure
costs
a
million
different
ways--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as
we
all
know,
and
they
just
now
have
got
a
new
cost
accounting
expert
who
figured
they've
been...
your
hospitals
have
been
overcharging
depreciation
for
years,
so
we're
going
to
take
a
second
look
at
your
costs
on
an
ad
hoc,
case-by-case
basis.
why
can't
they
do
that
under
clause
(ii)?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
wonder
who
wins
this
lawsuit
if
you
prevail.
well,
they
have--
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
regulators
generally
find
that
where
you've
go
a
place
in
nebraska
where
a
lot
of
people
work
part-time
and
not
full-time
you've
got
this
strange
result.
we
can
recover
it
without
any
special
regulation.
