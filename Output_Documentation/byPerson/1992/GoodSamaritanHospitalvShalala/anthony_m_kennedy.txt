well,
isn't
1395g
what
guides
the
government
in
determining
how
much
to
pay
out
at
the
outset?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
rather
than
being
a
retroactive
adjustment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
doesn't
1395g
tell
the
secretary
what
it
has
to
pay
out
on
an
ongoing
basis--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--prospectively
and
with
the
right
to
make
adjustments,
and
section...
clause
(ii)
that
we're
concerned
with
is
a
retroactive
adjustment,
or
am
i
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
calculating
the
ongoing
payments
that
the
secretary
makes
to
the
hospital,
or
to
the
provider.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
clear
to
be
why
you
can't
reach
the
result
you
want
to
reach
in
making
these
adjustments
under
1395g.
why
is
1395g
inadequate
to
accomplish
the
book-balancing
function
that
you
wish
to
accomplish
under
subpart
(ii)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
suppose...
suppose
there
were
two
regulations,
one
on
reimbursing
for
use
of
facilities,
the
other
for
the
payment
of
nurses,
and
each
of
those
methods
was
properly
applied
and
the
proper
payments
were
made,
but
the
aggregate
of
the
two
was...
well,
let's
say
that
the
aggregate
of
the
two
was
excessive
because
nurses
were
paid
too
much,
they
were
double-paid
because
their
costs
were
factored
into
the
facilities
somehow.
would
you
then
have
a
right
to
recoup?
i.e.,
you
then
have
two
methods,
both
of
which
are
being
used
for
different
things,
one's
facilities,
the
other's
nurses,
but
you
think
that
there's...
because
of
this
particular
hospital,
there's
a
double
counting,
so
you
want
money
back.
aren't
you
entitled
under
this
regulation
to
say
that
the
aggregate
is
excessive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
ms.
hedlund's
view
it
would.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
could
reach
the
result
your
clients
reached,
and
you
could
reach
the
results
of
reimbursement
without
use
of
that
word.
