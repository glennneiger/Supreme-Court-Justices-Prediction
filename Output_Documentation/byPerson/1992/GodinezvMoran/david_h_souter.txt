justice
souter
why
isn't
ms.
wax
correct
in
what
she
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
voluntary
and
reasonableness
standard
which
you're
pegging
your
case
on
now
presupposes
competence?
and
what
that
looks
to
is
the
particular
state
of
mind
at
the
moment
of
voluntariness
based
in
part
upon
knowledge
of
consequences,
i.e.
of
the
particular
decision.
why
isn't
she
correct
when
she
says
that
the
standard
that
you
are
now
arguing
for
presupposes
competence?
it's
not
a
substitution
for
it.
justice
souter
what
other
factors?
i'm
not
sure
understand
you.
justice
souter
you
mean
whether
the
court
is
inquiring
into
competence
or
whether
the
court
is
inquiring
into
voluntariness
it
could
take
account
of
the
medication?
is
that
your
point?
justice
souter
well
then
why,
why
then
doesn't
your
argument
boil
down
to
what
was
suggested
a
moment
ago,
that
you're
really
not
necessarily...
number
one,
you're
not
defending
the
ninth
circuit,
and
number
two,
your
argument
really
goes
not
to
the
need
for
a
new
standard
of
competence
in
general
but
to
the
need
for
as
particularized
an
inquiry
when
there
is
a
waiver
of
counsel
as
there
is
when
there
is
a
plea
of
guilty.
isn't
that
what
you're
really
arguing
for
now?
justice
souter
but
that's
not
what
the
ninth
circuit
held.
justice
souter
mr.
potter,
a
minute
ago
if
i
understood
you
i
thought
you
answered
a
question
of
mine
in
this
way,
that
what
was
defective
in
this
case
was
the
failure
of
the
court
to
make
the
kind
of
knowingness
and
voluntariness
inquiry
upon
the
waiver
or
attempted
waiver
of
counsel
that
would
have
been
required
if
the
defendant
had
pleaded
guilty.
now
i
understand
you
to
be
saying
something
different.
i
understand
you
now
to
be
saying
that
the
failure
here
was
in
fact
a
failure
under
existing
law,
the
existing
law
being
that
there
is
a
continuing
duty
on
the
part
of
the
court
to
make
an
inquiry
into
competence
whenever
facts
come
to
the
court's
attention
that
might
put
that
competence
in
question,
and
that
the
facts
in
this
case
were
facts
brought
to
the
court's
knowledge
about
the
drug
use,
the
medication
that
the
defendant
was
on.
and
so
that
your
claim
of
error
here
is
that
the
court
did
not
fulfill
its
affirmative
duty
under
existing
case
law
to
make
a
thorough
inquiry
to
find
out
whether
the
medication
had
in
fact
rendered
the
individual
incompetent.
is
that
your
position?
justice
souter
whether
or
not
that's
so,
it
sounds
to
me
as
though
what
you're
arguing
now
is
basically
that
there
was
an
error
under
existing
law.
the
ninth
circuit
may
have
gone
off
on
a
tangent
which
you
do
not
defend,
but
your
position
is
simply
that
there
was
an
error
under
existing
law.
