ms.
amy
l.
wax
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
this
case
is
that
a
valid
finding
of
competency
to
stand
trial
suffices
to
establish
competency
to
plead
guilty
or
waive
counsel.
this
court
formulated
a
test
of
competence
over
30
years
ago
in
dusky
v.
united
states,
and
we
believe
that
it
is
still
a
workable
standard
for
determining
competency
to
perform
all
of
the
functions
that
a
defendant
may
be
called
upon
to
perform
in
the
course
of
standing
trial.
now
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
this
court
should
reject
the
idea
that
a
person
can
go
to
trial
and
yet
be
unable
to
waive
constitutional
rights.
first,
that
view
seriously
distorts
the
meaning
of
dusky
and
the
standard
of
competence
to
stand
trial
in
this
court's
cases.
that
standard
must
be
understood
in
light
of
other
cases
of
this
court
such
as
jones
v.
barnes
that
identifies
certain
decisions
that
are
ultimately
for
the
defendant
to
make
in
the
course
of
trial.
therefore
in
order
to
be
competent
to
stand
trial
an
individual
must
at
least
have
the
potential
capacity
for
basic
decision
making
in
response
to
well
explained
alternatives.
and
there
is
no
difference
in
principle
or
practice
between
the
choices
that
confront
defendants
routinely
at
trial
and
the
decisions
at
issue
in
this
case.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
there--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
right.
we
would
distinguish
between
the
need
to
be
competent
to
make
these
decisions
and
whether
the
decisions
are
knowing
and
voluntary.
we
think
they
are
two
distinct
inquiries.
now,
a
waiver
being
knowing
and
voluntary
presumes
competence.
competence
is
a
subsidiary
finding
that
needs
to
be
made
before
a
waiver
can
be
knowing
and
intelligent.
competence
goes
to
the
inherent
qualities
of
mind,
the
functional
capacity
of
the
individual,
his
skills.
knowing
and
voluntary,
the
knowingness
and
voluntariness
of
a
waiver
goes
to
information--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
well,
we
think--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes.
a
person
has
to
have
been
found
competent
to
stand
trial
generally
under
the
dusky
standard
in
order
to
get
to
the
point
where
he
can
consider
making
that
choice.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
you're
right,
your
honor,
there
would
be,
you're
correct
insofar
as
you're
saying
that
you
don't
explicitly
need
to
make
a
finding
of
competence
for
every
defendant.
it's
only
when
there
is
a
good,
a
reason
to
doubt
an
individual's
competence
that
such
a
finding
need
be
made.
but
i
am
speaking
of
the
case
where
there
has
been
such
a
doubt.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
of
course.
exactly.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
but
we
think
that's
very
different
from
what
the
court
said
in
this
case.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
really
say
anything
about,
they
didn't
question
the
need
to
find
the
waiver
knowing
and
voluntary.
they
said
that
you
first
need
to
do
an
additional
inquiry
into
competence,
you
need
to
stop
everything
and
start
over
again
when
it
comes
to
competence,
make
a
finding
on
a
distinct
standard
and
then
go
on
and
do
the
inquiry
into
whether
the
competency
inquiry
is,
whether
the
waiver
is
knowing
and
voluntary.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes.
in
fact
we
think
that
they
are
relevant
to
whether
it
was
knowing--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes.
yes.
we
would
point
out,
though,
that
whether
the
pleas
were
knowing
and
voluntarily
made
is
not
the
question
presented
in
this
case.
the--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--we
think
they
could
look,
be
looked
at
under
both
rubrics.
the
ninth
circuit
happened
to
look
at
those
factors
when
it
questioned
the
competence
finding,
but
certainly
with
medication
you
could
argue
that
in
fact
it
goes
more
to
whether
it's
knowing
and
voluntary
because
if
you
stop
the
medication
then
the
person
might
change,
and
so
competence
is
sort
of
a
baseline
state
of
the
person.
we
agree
with
that.
now,
now
only
is
the
adoption
of
multiple
tests
of
competence
illogical
and
unnecessary
because
decision-making
ability
really
properly
is
part
of
the
dusky
inquiry,
but
it
also
will
have
tremendous
adverse
effects
on
the
trial
process.
first
of
all
it
will
endlessly
multiply
procedures,
the
procedures
that
the
trial
court
must
conduct.
it
will
require
the
trial
court
to
bring
the
proceedings
to
a
halt
and
conduct
a
fresh
inquiry
into
competence
every
time
it
looks
like
the
defense
needs
to
make
an
important
decision.
and
this
will
raise
all
sorts
of
opportunities
for
doubt
and
error--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--it's--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
if
you're
asking
whether
this
dusky
standard
applies
when
you
have
a
lawyer
and
when
you
don't
have
a
lawyer,
we
would
say
it
applies
under
both
circumstances.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
think
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
because
it
said
setting
aside
the
waiver
of
counsel
issue,
it
implied,
i
think,
that
if
you
plead
guilty
then
you
need
some
special
capacity
to
make
that
choice.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
with
or
without...
we
didn't
read
the
ninth
circuit
to
say
that
it
only
applied
because
this
person
didn't
have
a
lawyer.
we
see--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes,
we
would.
we
don't
think
an
extra
competency
determination
is
necessary
whether
you
have
a
lawyer
or
whether
you
don't
have
a
lawyer
because
competency
goes
to
those
qualities
of
mind
you
have
to
possess
to
go
to
trial.
the
lawyer
brings--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes.
but
the
lawyer...
to
consult
with
counsel
is
the
phrase
in
dusky.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that
is
a
way
of
measuring
a
certain
mental
capacity.
it's
a
method
of
summarizing
all
the
mental
functions
that
you
have
to
possess.
it's
put
in
terms
of
consulting
with
counsel,
but
it
doesn't
mean
it
only
applies
when
counsel
is
there.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
the
way
the
ninth,
we
would
say
that
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
decided
the
case,
although
they
did
fault
the
court
for
not
holding
a
hearing,
we
think
they
did
hold
a
hearing
by
the
way,
ultimately
the
rule
of
decision
here
was
that
there
was
an
erroneous
standard
for
competence
applied,
and
the
ninth
circuit
implied
that
if
dusky
really
was
the
standard
the
findings,
at
least
at
the
post
conviction
stage,
hearing
stage,
would
have
been
sufficient
to
ground
a
finding
of
competence.
the
ninth
circuit--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--before
the
ninth
circuit
respondent
said
in
fairly
crude
terms
that
his
plea
and
his
waiver
were
invalid,
and
he
didn't
really
parse
out
the
competence
and
whether
it
was
knowing
and
voluntary
factors
terribly
well
and
he
didn't
specifically
argue
that
the
wrong
standard
was
used.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that
was...
yes,
that
was
one
of
the
things
he
argued.
but
the
question
arises
what
standard
to
apply
at
the
hearing.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
our
answer
is
that
there
was
a
hearing.
