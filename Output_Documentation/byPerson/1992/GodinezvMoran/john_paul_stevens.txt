ms.
wax,
do
you
understand
that
that
would
be
necessary
even
when
the
man
has
been
determined
to
be
competent
in
the
dusky
sense
and
also
has
counsel?
justice
stevens
most
trials
you
do
have
a
lawyer
there,
and
i
had
sort
of
assumed
that
if
you
have
the
lawyer
then,
having
survived
the
dusky
standard,
that's
all
you
need.
justice
stevens
well,
the
dusky,
you
have
to
satisfy
the
dusky
standard
always,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
but
then
i'm
asking
you
whether
you
think
under
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
that
when
you
do,
when
you
satisfy
the
dusky
standard
and
when
you
do
have
a
lawyer
you
also
have
to
satisfy
a
higher
standard
on
every
other
thing
that
might
arise
during
the
trial?
justice
stevens
but
this
is
pleading
guilty
without
a
lawyer.
justice
stevens
well,
would
you
have
the
same
objection
to
the
ninth
circuit
holding
if
it
were
limited
in
that
respect?
justice
stevens
one
of
which
is
to
cooperate
with
counsel.
justice
stevens
right.
