mr.

chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sarnowski.
ms.
wax,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wax.
mr.
potter,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
potter,
westbrook
is
an
unargued
per
curiam,
1
page
long,
which
really
does
not
get
a
great
deal
of
precedential
deference
from
our
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so
it's
a
due
process
case.
that
doesn't
make
any
difference.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
it...
if
we
were
to
decide
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
dusky
competency
standard
was
perfectly
satisfactory
for
the
original
inquiry
as
to
competency
and
that
individual
waivers
of
rights
would
have
to
be
judged
by
what
the
court
could
look
at
at
that
particular
time,
then
ought
not
the
state
trial
court's
findings
to
receive
deference
because
they
did,
that
court
did
receive,
did
apply
the
correct
standard,
the
dusky
standard
which
would
be
applicable?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what's...
i
don't
understand
your
distinction
there,
mr.
potter.
i
mean,
i
don't
think
the
constitution
ever
says
anything
about
competency.
it
has
always
been
subsumed
under
the
due
process
clause.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
you
can't
be
brought
to
trial
unless
you're
competent
to
make
the
necessary
decisions
that
go
along
with
a
trial,
but
that's
the
dusky
standard.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying,
mr.
potter,
that,
put
the
dusky
standard
here
for
competence
to
stand
trial,
and
over
here
put
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
a
particular,
say
a
decision
not
to
take
the
stand
was
knowing
and
voluntary?
are
you
saying
that
there's
still
some
other
requirement
that
has
to
be
met
if
both
of
those
were
met,
that
at
the
time
the
person
is
asked
whether
or
not
to
take
the
stand
there
must
be
another
competency
inquiry?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
asking
what
is
your
contention.
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
there's
a
third
test
that
the
state
has
to
satisfy?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
potter.
mr.
sarnowski,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sarnowski.
the
case
is
submitted.
