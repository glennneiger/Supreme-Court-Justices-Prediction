mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
a
straight
forward
application
of
westbrook
v.
arizona
concerning
due
process
where
a
doubtfully
competent
defendant
seeks
to
waive
constitutional
rights
such
as
the
right
to
counsel.
in
this
instance
the
general
pate
and
query
as
to
competency
to
stand
trial,
to
assist
counsel,
and
understand
the
proceedings
is
not
enough.
due
process
requires
a
specific
determination
by
the
psychiatrist
as
to
the
defendant's
competency
to
waive
counsel.
this
is
not
a
case
of
heightened
standards,
but
context-specific
inquiries
into
the
competency
to
waive
counsel.
the
trial
court--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--they
did
apply
a
reasoned
choice,
but
it's
a
higher
standard
in
terms
of
what
their
decision
was.
but
the
real
critical
issue
here
is
the
wrong
standard
was
applied,
and
the
wrong
standard
was
that
they
were
dealing,
the
state
court
was
dealing
with
a
faretta
canvas
instead
of
going
through
a
westbrook
type
hearing
as
a
matter
of
due
process.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
the
whole
sieling
v.
eyman
case
that
the
ninth
circuit
relied
upon
is
based
upon
westbrook
and
pate.
and
the
pate
hearing
that
came
out
in
the
same
time
as
westbrook,
those
types
of
analysis,
particularly
here
where
an
individual
has
a
question
as
to
his
competence,
clearly
they
had
done
the
initial
hearing
as
to
his
ability
to
understand
what
was
occurring
and
his
ability
to
assist
counsel.
so
the
court
is
on
notice
at
that
particular
point
in
time--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--that
is
correct,
but
it's
a
due
process
case.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
and
it
stands
for
the
precedent
that--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--same
thing.
it
goes
to
the
voluntariness
issue.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
that's
correct.
but
the
issues
here--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--it's
a
decisional
competency
that's
entwined
with
johnson
v.
zerbst
as
to
voluntariness.
and
whether
it's
a
broader
inquiry,
a
focused
inquiry,
is
not
the
real
issue.
it's
not
whether
this
is
a
reasoned
choice,
although
reasoned
choices
are
involved.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
to
reach
that
issue
as
to
a
bright
line
test.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
well,
the
standard
is
the
reasoned
or
the
voluntariness
and
the
intelligent
waiver.
the
reasoned
choice
is
the
standard
that
could
be
applied.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
yes.
and
although
there
is
also
an
actual
competency
type
analysis,
under
the
pate
analysis
there
is
also
a
due
process
analysis
as
to
competency.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
the
rationale
that
the
ninth
circuit
used
is
that
the
state
courts
used
an
improper
standard.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
yes.
and
the
improper
standard
was--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--well,
there
is,
that
can
be
accepted
as
the
proper
standard.
what
we're
saying
is
that
their
inquiry
also
deals
with,
although
it
says
reasoned
choice
and
a
heightened
standard,
it's
also
a
broader
standard
from
the
due
process
standpoint
that
there
has
to
be
a
searching
inquiry
made.
and
what
was
important
in
this
particular
case
was
that
the
court
was
aware
and
had
doubts
as
to
mr.
moran's
competency.
they
did
the
initial
analysis.
they
knew
that
he
had--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--yes.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
well,
they,
the
ninth
circuit
did
say
that
an
improper
standard
was
applied,
the
improper
standard
being
the
reasonable
choice
standard.
but
from
a
due
process
standpoint--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--because
she
presupposed
in
the
answer
that
in
fact
the
individual
did
not
have
these
other
factors,
presupposed
that--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--the
factors
that
the
court
was
aware
of
when
they
did
their
initial
analysis
about
the
fact
that
he
was
competent
to
assist
counsel
and
had
an
understanding.
the
court
was
aware
at
that
time--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--yes.
and
that
was
the
other
factor.
in
addition,
what
mr.
moran
was
doing--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--yes.
yes,
we
are.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
what
we're
saying
is
in
this
insuance
that
because
mr.
moran
was
on
medication...
the
competency
is
already
made
before
the
colloquy
takes
place.
the
court
is
aware
that
he
is
on
medication,
yet
unbelievably
does
not
ask
what
kind
of
medication
he
is
on.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
but
that
is
the
actual
competency
and
not
as
to
due
process.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
under
the
voluntariness
aspects
of
the
case--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--yes.
we're
talking
about
a
procedural
due
process.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
well,
that's
the
dusky
standard,
but
not
as
to
specific
and
actual
decisions.
in
this
instance
under
the
westbrook
analysis
we're
dealing
with
the
waiver
of
counsel.
we
also
cited
the
nevada
courts
to
the
application
of
a
pate
type
hearing,
that
when
a
different
analysis,
a
different
decisional
type
situation
occurs
that
you
have
to
have
a
different
analysis
as
to
whether
in
fact
the
individual
is
competent.
he
may
be
competent
to
stand
trial,
but
he
certainly
may
not
be
competent
if
he's
waiving
counsel
to
make
those
same
types
of
decisions.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
we
cited
sieling
v.
eyman.
we
did
not
necessarily
ask
for
a
higher
standard.
we
asked
for
a
hearing,
and
because
of
the--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--right.
because
the
concern
was
that
they
were
dealing
strictly
with
faretta
and
whether
in
fact
a
faretta
canvas,
and
they
weren't
dealing
with
the
due
process
argument
of
whether
in
fact
we
were
entitled
to
further
inquiry
as
to
his
ability
to
make
this
reasoned
choice
in
making
his
waiver
of
counsel,
also
making
the
decision
that
he
didn't
want
to
put
forward
any
kind
of
mitigation
circumstances.
so
clearly
he
did
not
have
his
self-interest.
i
believe
that--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--yes.
yes.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
i'm
sorry?
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
well,
in
this
situation
he
comes
in
to
waive
a
decision
in
terms
of
the
context
of
when
the
decision
is
made.
the
initial
analysis
in
this
case
required
a
decision
about
competency
to
stand
trial
and
a
decision
to
assist
counsel.
then
you
have
a
focused
inquiry
in
the
context
specific
as
to
whether
in
fact
he
can
make
this
decision
to
waive
counsel
and
give
up
his
rights
of
representation.
so
to
that
analysis
it
is
different.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
we
didn't
have
a
hearing--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
that's
right.
we
didn't
argue
a
heightened
standard.
we
did
not
argue
a
heightened
standard
to
the
ninth
circuit,
nor
did
we
necessarily
argue
a
heightened
standard
at
any
juncture
in
this
case.
what
we
were
arguing
was
that
we
were
entitled
to
a
hearing,
that
the
court,
because
they
knew
this
individual
was
on
medication,
they
had
already
made
a
determination
as
to
competency--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--it
didn't
focus
on
the
right
standard--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--as
to
that
issue.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
the
finding
would
be
as
to
law
on
the
due
process
issue,
and
that's
the
distinction.
there
may
be
a
finding
as
to
competency,
as
to
actual
competency
that
might
have
some
kind
of
deference
in
terms
of
the
fact
finding,
but
what
occurred
here
was
a
double
barrelled
argument.
we
were
talking
about
the
medication
as
to
actual
competency,
but
we
were
also
saying
that
we
were
entitled
to
a
hearing
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
this
individual
could
waive
his
counsel
and
whether
in
fact
he
was
acting
in
his
own
self
interest.
our
argument
was
essentially
that
johnson-zerbst
invokes
a
protection
of
the
trial
court
when
the
accused
is
without
counsel
to
assure
the
voluntariness.
what
it
said
was
that
there's
a
mixed
fact.
the
protecting
duty
imposes
serious
and
weighty
responsibilities
upon
the
trial
judge
of
determining
whether
there
is
an
intelligent
and
competent
waiver.
and
we
look
to
justice
frankfurter
and
jackson
statements
in
von
moltke
v.
gillies
about
a
searching
inquiry
of
the
court
that
there
must
be
an
understanding
choice.
now
in
westbrook
the
court
reiterated
the
distinction
between
competency
to
stand
trial
with
counsel
and
competency
to
proceed
uncounseled.
it
required
a
separate
inquiry
because
dusky
addresses
a
different
question.
although
it
may
be
the
same
standard,
the
context
specific
is
what
is
important,
whether
in
fact
you
can
assist
counsel.
our
argument
is
that
the
plea
to
be
voluntary
must
be
understood.
dusky
does
not
answer
the
same
three
questions
about
waiver
of
counsel,
about
plea,
and
the
mitigating
evidence.
we
look
to
pate
v.
robinson
and
drope.
it
says
that
demeanor
is
not
enough.
so
the
mere
fact
that
the
trial
court
had
the
individual
before
them
was
not
enough.
in
addition,
this
court
said
in
pate
that
a
6-year
old
re-analysis
was
not
sufficient.
due
process
does
not
require
this
higher
standard,
but
requires
a
separate
inquiry.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
that's
correct,
and
that
was
our
argument
that
we
were
asking
for
in
terms
of
the
due
process.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
there
is
a
difference
between
the
actual
competence
and
the
specific
inquiry
as
to
whether
in
fact
an
individual
can
make
decisional
matters
such
as
the
waiver
of
counsel
and
the
right
to
give
up
his
assistance.
in
this
instance
i
think--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--right.
as
to
the
voluntariness.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
we're
saying
it's
a
different
focus.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
that's
what
pate
says--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--my
contention
is
yes,
if
there
are
factors
that
show
that
there's
a
continuing
duty
on
the
part
of
the
court
that
the
individual
brings
forward
some--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--it's
not
a
third
test.
it's
a
situation
of
where
they
have
a
continuing
obligation
if
additional
factors
come
forward.
in
this
instance
the
additional
factor
that
came
before
the
court
at
the
time
it's
doing
this
canvas
is
the
situation
where
he
is
told
that
he
is
on
medication.
there
is
absolutely
no
question
at
that
point
as
to
what
effect
the
medication
had
upon
him,
whether
in
fact
he
was,
the
dosages
that
he
was
taking,
whether
he
understood
what
was
going
forward.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
yes.
and
the
general
questions
as
to
competency
dealt
only
with
his
ability
to
assist
counsel
and
to
stand
trial.
they
did
not
deal
with
the
specific
aspect
of
him
waiving
counsel,
of
him
deciding
that
he
was
entering,
going
to
enter
a
guilty
plea.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
at
the
criminal
trial
or
the
entry
of
plea.
at
the
post
conviction
they
dealt
strictly
with
actual
competency
and
not
with
this
due
process
aspect.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
we
did.
we
also
made
another
argument
that
in
fact
we
were
entitled
to
a
hearing
and
cited
the
court
to--
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
--no,
in
terms
of
a
hearing
as
to
his
competency
at
the
time
of
the
plea.
our
argument
was
that
the
nevada
supreme
court
had
adopted
melacor,
the
pate
type
situation,
which
required
them
to
go
through
a
hearing,
that
pate
required
them
under
a
context-specific
situation
to
make
an
additional
determination
of
competency,
his
competency
at
that
time
to
waive
counsel
and
enter
a
plea.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
yes.
we
had
made
a
double
argument
that
in
fact
in
terms
of
the
medication
that
he
was
incompetent
as
to
actual
competency.
we
also
made
an
argument
that
the
court
was
required,
upon
already
knowing
that
there
was
a
question
as
to
his
competency
to
stand
trial
and
assist
counsel
because
of
the
fact
that
he
had
committed
suicide.
so
they
did
a
preliminary
psychiatric
examination.
but
in
addition
to
that
when
they
were
made
aware
of
the
medication
we
were
also
entitled
to
an
additional
competency
hearing.
what
really
occurred
here
was
no
competency
hearing
at
the
time
that
these
pleas
were
entered
and
the
waiver
of
counsel
was
made.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
that's
correct.
and
the
existing
law,
sieling
v.
eyman,
that
case
encompasses
the
same
thing
that
melacor
v.
the
nevada
supreme
court,
which
incorporates
the
pate
type
hearing,
is
the
same
analysis.
and
that
was
the
argument
that
we
made.
mr.
cal
j.
potter,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
incidence
in
this
situation
is
that
they
did,
the
state
courts
did
apply
the
wrong
standard.
we
were
essentially
dealing
with
an
argument
about
competency
to
waive
counsel,
westbrook,
and
they
were
dealing
with
faretta.
we
were
talking
about
actual
competency
and
they
stayed
with
actual
competency
and
did
not
do
anything
with
our
argument
about
due
process
in
terms
of
the
pate
analysis.
and
those
were
the
arguments
that
were
made.
