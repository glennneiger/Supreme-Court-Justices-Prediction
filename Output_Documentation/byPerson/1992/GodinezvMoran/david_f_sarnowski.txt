mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
thousands
of
cases
are
processed
in
our
criminal
justice
system
in
both
the
state
and
federal
courts
throughout
this
land
each
day.
the
lesser
number
involve
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
defendant
is
competent
to
proceed
to
trial.
in
this
case
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
federal
habeas
corpus
review
of
a
state
court
conviction
and
the
imposition
of
three
death
sentences
concluded
that
there
is
a
heightened
standard
for
the
determination
of
whether
a
defendant
may
proceed
to
either
waive
counsel
or
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty,
which
occurred
in
this
case.
we
take
exception
to
that
ruling,
and
that
is
the
issue
that
brings
us
here
today.
however,
there
are
some
underlying
findings
by
the
state
trial
court
that
i
would
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to,
specifically
they
appear
at
page
21
of
the
joint
appendix.
at
that
point
the
trial
judge.
judge
leavitt,
determined
that
this
petitioner,
richard
moran,
was
in
fact
competent.
he
utilized
language
which
tracked
a
nevada
statute
on
point,
nevada
revised
statute
178.400,
which
in
turn
is
a
formulation
of
this
court's
pronouncement
in
dusky.
he
also
made
an
express
finding
that
mr.
moran
knew
the
consequences
of
his
plea
of
guilty
and
that
he
can
intelligently
and
knowingly
waive
his
constitutional
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
in
1988
the
judge
made
additional
findings
which
also
appear
in
the
trial
record
and
are
before
this
court,
particularly
at
the
pages
d-7
and
d-8
of
the
petition.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
our
position
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
that
once
a
defendant
meets
a
standard
of
competence
established
by
this
court
in
dusky,
then
a
defendant
is
competent
to
proceed
either
to
waive
counsel,
to
plead
guilty,
or
to
proceed
to
trial.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--to
answer
your
second
question
first,
yes,
there
are
reasoned
choices
that
have
to
be
made--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
a
critical
choice
that
each
defendant
if
they
choose
to
proceed
to
trial
must
make.
if
they
choose
to
proceed
to
trial
they
must
decide
whether
or
not
they
are
going
to
have
a
jury
trial
or
have
a
bench
trial
in
those
states
which
allow
a
defendant
to
waive
a
jury
trial.
those
are
critical
determinations
that
the
defendant
has
to
make.
they
are,
in
our
estimation,
equally
important
as
to
a
defendant's
cause
as
is
the
decision
by
a
defendant
to
waive
counsel
or
to
plead.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
we
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
this
case
two
psychiatrists
examined
the
defendant
and
expressed
their
opinions
in
terms
of
dusky,
the
dusky
standard.
neither
expressed
a
view
that
he
was
incapable
of
either
assisting
counsel
or
proceeding
to
trial.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
we
believe
that
the
trial
judge,
judge
leavitt,
both
asked
the
correct
question
and
received
the
answer
which
was
in
context
and
directly
addressed
to
the
judge's
question
both--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--it
is
our
position
that
if
a
defendant
is
assessed
and
it
is
determined
by
the
trial
court
that
he
has
a
factual
and
rational
understanding
of
the
proceedings,
that
he
has
the
ability
to
assist,
not
necessarily
that
counsel
actually
is
assisting,
because
as
was
the
case
here
the
defendant
ultimately
chose
not
to
have
counsel,
but
if
he
does
have
that
ability
to
assist
he
has,
he
meets
the
baseline
standard
which
also
includes
the
ability
to
make
a
reasoned
choice.
he
must
make
a
reasoned
choice
at
all
stages
of
the
proceedings,
and
if
he
at
some
point
in
time
does
not
meet
a
competency
standard,
then
as
an
officer
of
the
court
it's
up
to
his
counsel
or
the
prosecutor
or
up
to
the
court
sua
sponte
to
ascertain
whether
the
proceeding
should
be
suspended
or
not.
in
this
case--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--i
believe
that
the
judge
has
to
independently
ascertain
that
the
defendant
is
competent
and--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--yes.
but
in
the
sequence
of
events
that
may
well
happen
a
judge
may
proceed
on
a
boykin
canvas
or
a
faretta
canvas
in
terms
of
a
defendant
waiving
counsel
and
ascertain
that
a
further
inquiry
into
competence
is
necessary.
the
competence
evaluation
does
not
necessarily
occur
first
in
every
instance.
here
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
that
faced
the
trial
judge
understandably
did
not
peak
any
further
inquiry
once
he
had
made
his
conclusion.
it
has
to
be
noted
from
the
record
that
both
trial
counsel
appointed
to
represent
mr.
moran
in
these
two
separate
incidences
were
present
in
court
up
to
the
time
that
the
judge
made
his
finding
that
mr.
moran
was
competent.
and
in
fact
at
the
conclusion
of
the
competence
determination
before
the
judge
allowed
them
to
be
discharged
the
record
clearly
reflects
that
he
asked
them
if
they
had
anything
to
say
to
the
court
or
to
address
the
court
and
they
chose
not
to
and
indicated
that
the
judge
had
covered
what
was
necessary.
at
that
point
in
time
the
judge
had
fulfilled
the
requisite
requirements
under
dusky.
however,
the
question
before
us
is
did
the
ninth
circuit
standard
require
a
baseline
of
constitutional
due
process
for
those
defendants
either
waiving
counsel
or
pleading
guilty
which
is
higher
than
the
baseline
this
court
established
in
dusky.
it
is
our
contention
that
no
such
standard
is
required
by
the
pronouncements
of
this
court,
nor
should
one
be
applied
for
there
are
several
problems
that
ensue
because
of
it,
the
first
and
not
the
least
of
which
is
if
you
require
a
defendant
to
be
more
competent
to
waive
counsel
in
some
instances
you
do
not
allow
a
defendant
to
exercise
the
parallel
right
to
represent
himself,
which
this
court
clearly
set
out
in
faretta.
the
second--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
yes,
that's
what
they
said.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
no,
we
would
not.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
each
defendant
throughout
the
process
has
to
make
reasoned
choices.
they
may
not
be
a
choice
you
or
i
would
make
if
we
were
standing
in
his
shoes
or
they
may
not
be
the
choice
that
with
hindsight
we
would
say
was
the
best
choice
available
to
him,
but
it's
the
defendant's
choice.
in
fact
in
noting
the
opposition
to
our
initial
petition
for
certiorari
the
respondent
in
this
case
indicated
that
it
was
merely
a
matter
of
semantics
as
to
the
argument
involved
and
that
our
petition
did
not
present
a
question
that
this
court
should
consider.
however,
it
is
very
clear--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--your
honor,
the
ninth
circuit
relied
on
a
premise
that
merely
because
the
state
courts
applied
an
incorrect
standard
as
far
as
the
law
is
concerned
that
its
factual
findings
were
not
due
any
deference,
and
we
would
certainly
take
issue
with
that.
the
facts
are
what
they
are,
regardless
of
the
applicable
legal
standard.
it
is
clear
that
this
court's
pronouncements
in
maggio
v.
fulford
and
miller
v.
fenton
require
deference
by
the
federal
courts
to
findings
of
historical
fact
for
state
criminal
defendants.
that
did
not
occur
in
this
case,
and
in
fact
we
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
circuit
court
panel
considering
the
case
substituted
its
own
facts
for
those
not
found
to
be
weighty
in
the
state
court
system.
for
instance,
they
relied
on
certain
extracts
from
a
physicians'
desk
reference
and
noted
that
certain
medications
that
the
defendant
was
using
at
the
time
of
his
plea
had
certain
properties.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
that's
correct.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
regardless
of
the
standard
to
be
applied
they
should
not
have
substituted
its
judgment
and
allocated
different
weights
than
the
state
courts.
in
this
particular
instance
the
state
trial
judge
when
he
conducted
the
post
conviction
review
hearing
in
1988
expressly
declined
to
find
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
defendant
was
under
the
influence
of
some
prescription
medications
had
any
significant
weight,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
found
that
the
defendant
had
failed
under
state
law
to
bear
his
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
that
had
any
medical
significance
in
that--
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
--we
believe...
yes,
your
honor,
in
this
sense.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
that
is
the
question
presented.
however,
the
circuit
court's
conclusion
in
this
case
was
inextricably
bound
to
its
own
substituted
facts.
and
it
is
our
position
that
had
it
not
substituted
the
facts,
even
under
the
heightened
standard,
the
defendant
in
this
case
could
not
prevail,
and
clearly
he
could
not
prevail
under
the
standard
that
we
espouse
before
the
court.
in
this
instance
the
trial
judge
looked
at
the
totality
of
circumstances
to
assess
the
defendant's
competence,
and
only
when
he
concluded
that
he
was
competend
did
he
proceed
to
a
very
thorough
faretta
canvas
which
appears
in
this
record.
and
then
and
only
then
did
he
allow
waiver
of
counsel,
and
then
he
proceeded
into
a
very
thorough
plea
canvas
which
comports
fully
with
this
court's
holdings
in
boykin
and
the
subsequent
cases
that
ensued
as
a
result
of
boykin.
although
the
defendant
contested
the
knowing
and
intelligent
quality
of
the
pleas
that
he
entered,
those
legal
determinations
were
made
in
the
state
courts.
and
truly
the
federal
courts
never
got
to
the
issue
because
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
was
grounded
in
its
ruling
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
higher
standard
applied
in
this
case.
it
never
got
to
the
intelligent
and
knowing
waiver
issues.
however,
in
further
response
to
justice
kennedy's
initial
inquiry,
once
competence
is
ascertained
it
is
our
belief
that
there
are
protections
built
into
the
system,
the
requirements
that
those
canvases
in
both
faretta
instances
and
boykin
instances
must
be
knowing
and
intelligent,
and
that
together
the
dusky
standard,
the
faretta
standard,
and
the
boykin
standard
provide
the
minimal
due
process
that
each
defendant
should
have
in
our
system
before
they
are
held
to
account
for
their
actions
in
a
criminal
court,
be
it
state
or
federal.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
the
ninth
circuit
clearly
disposed
of
this
case
below
by
applying
the
heightened
standard.
at
page
a-27
of
the
petition
the
lower
court's
decision
is
set
forth
in
which
it
says
that
certain
observations
made
by
the
trial
court
were
inadequate
to
show
that
mr.
moran
was
competent
according
to
the
higher
standard
of
reasoned
choice
that
the
law
requires.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
that's
our
position,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
f.
sarnowski
i
suppose
it
would
border
somewhat
on
speculation
on
my
part,
but
it
would
seem
that's
one
reading
of
their
decision.
in
this
case
if
the
higher
standard
does
not
apply,
deference
must
be
afforded.
mr.
potter's
argument
was
that
no
hearing
was
held,
and
that's
what
they
really
proffered
to
the
ninth
circuit
as
a
basis
for
relief,
fails
to
recognize
that
a
hearing
was
held.
and
although
this
court
has
said
that
it
is
not
the
preferred
method
of
assessing
competence
to
have
a
hearing
after
the
fact,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
same
trial
judge
conducted
a
hearing
and
applied
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
same
party
who
had
the
burden
under
nevada
state
law,
doggett
v.
state,
a
1977
case,
to
show
that
he
was
incompetent.
of
course
this
court
just
said
last
term
that
it
is
not
impermissible
to
require
a
defendant
to
bear
that
burden
of
proof,
in
medina.
he
didn't
bear
that
burden
of
proof,
and
in
fact
the
judge
was
singularly
unpersuaded
by
his
proffer
of
evidence
and
his
failure
to
show
how
the
medication
impacted
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
the
entry
of
plea
and
waiver
of
counsel
situation.
the
nevada
supreme
court
affirmed
that.
he
had
his
hearing.
and
this
court's
recent
pronouncement
in
keeney
v.
thomiel
reyes
would
seem
to
say
the
fact
that
he
didn't
present
the
evidence
then
requires
him
to
make
a
showing
of
cause
and
prejudice,
and
he
hasn't
even
argued
that,
much
less
shown
it.
he
should
not
be
given
the
second
opportunity
in
the
federal
courts
to
do
what
he
had
the
opportunity
to
do,
but
did
not,
in
the
state
courts.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
have
no
further
argument.
