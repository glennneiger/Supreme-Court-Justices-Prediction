justice
o'connor
what
do
you
think
you
have
to
show
to
say
that
a
defendant
is
competent
to
assist
counsel
in
his
defense?
what
do
you
think
that
encompasses?
are
there
reasoned
choices
to
be
made
when
you
end
up
going
to
trial
and
have
to
be
represented
by
counsel
and
have
to
assist
counsel?
justice
o'connor
such
as
whether
to
testify?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
then
that
in
order
to
determine
whether
a
defendant
is
able
to
assist
counsel
in
his
own
defense
that
the
determination
of
mental
competence
of
necessity
includes
a
determination
of
whether
he
can
make
a
reasoned
choice?
justice
o'connor
well,
ms.
wax,
the
ninth
circuit
appeared
to
be
concerned
about
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
on
medication
and
the
trial
court
didn't
know
the
effect
of
the
medication,
and
that
the
answers
were
monosyllabic,
and
so
forth.
would
those
factors
go
into
determining
whether
the
plea
was
knowingly
and
intelligently
made?
justice
o'connor
they
might
be
relevant
to
competence
as
well.
justice
o'connor
well,
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
whether
the,
some
of
the
things
that
bothered
the
ninth
circuit
are
appropriately
looked
at
not
only
in
the
question
of
competence
but
in
knowing
whether
it's
knowing
and
intelligent.
justice
o'connor
did
the
defendant
before
the
ninth
circuit
argue
for
a
higher
standard
for
determining
competency
to
enter
a
plea
and
waive
counsel?
justice
o'connor
the
focus
of
your
argument
was
to
get
a
hearing
at
that
stage?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
in
order
to
be
competent
to
stand
trial,
which
includes
competence
to
assist
counsel
in
the
defense,
that
that
includes
a
capacity
to
make
reasoned
decisions?
