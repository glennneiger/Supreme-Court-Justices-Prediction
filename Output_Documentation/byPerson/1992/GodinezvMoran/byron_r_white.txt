justice
white
the
court
of
appeals
said
they
weren't
bound
by
the
results
of
a
state
court
hearing
because
they
applied
the
wrong
standard?
justice
white
and
they
said
that
their
standard
of
reasoned
choice
is
a
higher
standard?
justice
white
so
they
must
have
thought
it
was.
do
you
think
it's...
if
the
court
hadn't
said
so
would
you
think
it's
a
higher
standard?
reasoned
choice?
justice
white
well,
it
set
aside
a
state
court...
it
refused
to
follow
a
state
court
finding
that
otherwise
it
should
have.
justice
white
but
they
were
looking
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
their
standare.
justice
white
which
you
say
was
wrong.
if
it's
supposed
to
be
a
higher
standard
you
say
they
had
no
business
applying
a
higher
standard.
justice
white
do
you
think
this
argument
you're
making
now
is
within
your
question
presented,
the
single
question
presented?
justice
white
i
thought
the
only
question
you
presented
was
whether
the
constitution
requires
a
trial
court
to
apply
a
heightened
reasoned
choice
standard
to
determine
competency
of
a
defendant
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
or
waive
counsel.
justice
white
do
you
think
that
the
tests
that
we
have
frequently
articulated
with
respect
to
pleas
of
guilty
and
waivers
of
counsel,
do
you
know
of
any
case
where
in
such
a
case
we
used
the
dusky
language?
i
always
thought
it
was
voluntary
and
intelligent.
justice
white
isn't
that
the
test?
justice
white
that's
what
you
usually
read.
justice
white
so
you
think
in
testing
out
the
validity
of
a
plea
of
guilty
then
you
should
not
only
ask
whether
it's
voluntary
and
intelligent,
but
you
should
go
through
the
dusky
catechism
too?
justice
white
is
that
right?
yes?
justice
white
well,
that
may
be
so
where
competency
is
challenged,
but
say
in
the
ordinary
case
there's
no
challenge
to
the
competency
of
somebody
and
yet,
and
he
wants
to
plead
guilty.
are
you,
should
you
go
through
the
dusky
catechism
or
not?
justice
white
but
even
if
they
go
through
the
dusky
routine
and
find
the
person
competent,
to
sustain
a
plea
of
guilty
you
should
go,
you
should
go
on
to
find
it
at
least
voluntary?
justice
white
and
intelligent?
justice
white
the
ninth
circuit
thought
it
was
applying
a
higher
standard
because
that's
the
reason
it
refused
to
follow
the
state
court
determination.
justice
white
well,
what
is
the
standard--
--well,
that's
a
different
issue.
you
refer
to
westbrook
as
if
it
were
some
terribly
well
known
case,
a
westbrook
hearing.
i
mean,
i
haven't
seen
westbrook
cited
i
don't
think
in
25
or
30
years
until
now.
justice
white
it
doesn't
sound
to
me
like
you're
really
defending
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
you're
defending
the
judgment,
perhaps,
but
not
on
the
rationale
that
the
ninth
circuit
is.
justice
white
yes.
are
you
defending
that?
justice
white
so
you
say...
i
though
you
should
answer,
you
should
have
answered
justice
kennedy
then
the
standard
is
reasoned
choice.
that's
the
only
one
there
is.
i'm
defending
the
ninth
circuit
judgment.
justice
white
so
you
want
us
to
decide
that
there
wasn't
a
sufficient
inquiry
here
and
therefore
to
affirm?
justice
white
that's,
i
suppose
that
isn't
the
way
the
ninth
circuit
went
about
it,
but
you
want
us
to
affirm
on
that
ground
even
though
you
didn't
cross
appeal
their
opinion?
justice
white
you're
really
talking
about
a
procedural
due
process.
justice
white
you
say
the
hearing
you
got
in
the
state
courts
was
not
an
adequate
hearing?
justice
white
well,
anyway,
you
say
it
was
not
an
adequate
hearing.
justice
white
yes.
and
therefore
the
findings
of
the
state
court
weren't
entitled
to
deference.
justice
white
are
you
talking
about
the
post
conviction
hearing
or
at
the
criminal
trial?
justice
white
well,
i
thought
the
challenge
was
to
the,
in
the
post
conviction
hearing
the
case
was
in
state
habeas,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
was
that
the
defendant
challenged
the
voluntariness
of
his
plea.
justice
white
well,
you
had
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
the
post
conviction,
at
the
post
conviction
stage.
justice
white
if
you're
not
defending
the
higher
standard
requirement
that
the
ninth
circuit
insisted
on,
i
suppose
if
we
disabuse
them
of
that
we
could,
we
wouldn't
need
to
decide
the
argument
you're
making
now.
we
could
remand
and
you
could
take
it
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
which
is
what
you
argued
to
them
anyway.
