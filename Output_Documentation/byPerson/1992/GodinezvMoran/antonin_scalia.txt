justice
scalia
ms.
wax,
is
this
case
about
the
standard
that
should
be
used
or
is
it
really
about
whether
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
a
hearing?
what
was
the
defendant
arguing
about
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
scalia
was
that
the
focus
of
the
attack
before
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
scalia
but
he
did
say
i
should
have
had
a
hearing.
he
made
that
very
clear,
didn't
he?
justice
scalia
subsequently,
after
you
decide
whether
you
need
a
hearing
or
not,
i
suppose
you
then
have
to
decide
what
standard
you
apply.
but
isn't
that
a
prior
question,
and
wasn't
that
the
question
really
raised?
justice
scalia
it
sounds
like
you're
back
where
you
were
in
the
court
of
appeals.
your
complaint
here
is
he
just
didn't
have
a
hearing.
justice
scalia
your
complaint
is
that
you
did
not
have
a
particular
hearing
at
the
particular
time
on
the
particular
reasoned
decision
to
be
made.
justice
scalia
it's
not
so
much
the
standard
that
you're
worried
about.
justice
scalia
then
again
it
does
not
require
a
higher
standard,
it
just
requires
a
separate
inquiry?
justice
scalia
well,
i
mean,
i
suppose
you
can
be
fully
competent
and
yet
not
have
made
an
effective
waiver
because
all
the
facts
weren't
in
front
of
you
or
because
you
misunderstood
the
consequence,
or
so
forth
and
so
on,
right?
it's
not
even
entirely
the
same
issue,
is
it?
is
it
entirely
an
issue
of
competence?
justice
scalia
your
right
to
a
hearing
doesn't
just
go
to
competence.
if
you
want
a
separate
hearing
on
this
issue
it's
not
just
because
you're
worried
about
the
person's
competence.
you're
worried
about
whether
he
has
been
advised
as
to
the
consequences
of
this
particular...
there
are
a
lot
of
other
things.
justice
scalia
so
it's
not
really
a
competence
question
at
all.
it's
a
question
of
whether
the
waiver
was
effective.
competence
is
one
element
of
that.
and
you're
not
asserting
that
for
that
one
element
the
standard
is
any
higher
than
it
is
for
competence
to
stand
trial?
justice
scalia
i
suppose
it
would
have
had
to
do
that
in
order
to
reverse
the
state
court's
determination,
wouldn't
it,
because
otherwise
the
state
court's
determination
is
subject
to
deference
under
2254(d)?
justice
scalia
you
think
that's
why
the
ninth
circuit
felt
constrained
to
find
a
higher
standard?
