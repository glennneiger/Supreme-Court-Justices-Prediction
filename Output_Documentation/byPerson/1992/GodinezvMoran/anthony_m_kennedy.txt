justice
kennedy
do
you
say
that
the
finding
of
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
is
a
higher
standard
or
a
lower
standard
or
indistinguishable
from
what
the
ninth
circuit
found
was
the
standard,
which
was
i
believe
a
reasoned
choice?
justice
kennedy
did
the
trial
court
ask
the
wrong
question
and
reach
the
right
answer
or
did
it
ask
the
right
question
and
reach
the
right
answer,
in
your
opinion?
justice
kennedy
it's
not
altogether
precise,
it
seems
to
me,
when
we're
concerned
with
the
competency
to
waive
that
you
asked
about
competency
to
stand
trial.
it's
just
a
little
bit
different
question.
i
understand
the
point,
that
competency
to
stand
trial
may
indicate
a
level
of
mental
stability
that's
sufficient.
justice
kennedy
is
competency
comprehended
within
knowing
and
intelligent
voluntary
waiver?
would
it
be
satisfactory
for
a
judge
to
say
before
i
allow
you
to
plead
i'm
going
to
insure
that
your
plea
and
the
waiver
of
rights
is
knowing,
intelligent,
and
voluntary?
would
that
suffice
in
a
case
where
we
have
some
question
about
competency?
justice
kennedy
so
that's
different
than
knowing
and
intelligent?
justice
kennedy
in
your
submission
what
is
the
standard
that
a
trial
court
should
use
in
determining
competency
to
plead
guilty
and
to
waive
the
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
kennedy
maybe
we
do,
maybe
we
don't.
but
what
i
hear
you
say
is
that
you're
backing
away
as
quickly
as
possible
from
the
reasoned
choice
standard
used
by
the
ninth
circuit.
that's
the
way
i
read
your
brief
at
page
17.
you're
just
telling
us
well,
you
have
to
look
at
everything,
make
a
contextual
inquiry,
but
you
don't
give
us
any
standard
at
all.
justice
kennedy
so
you
think
knowing,
intelligent,
and
voluntary
waiver
includes,
comprehends
competency?
justice
kennedy
you
agree
that
there
was
a
general
inquiry
as
to
competency
at
this
hearing,
do
you
not?
