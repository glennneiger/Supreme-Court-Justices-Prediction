mr.
manning,
is
that
the
right-of-way
criterion,
whether
it
goes
over
city
streets?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
in
new
york
city,
you
could
wire
up
an
entire
city
block
without
using
city
rights-of-way.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
a
lot
of
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
owner
would
have
real
monopoly
power
over
that...
at
least
over
all
the
people
within
that
block.
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
therefore
greater
need
for
rate
regulation,
which
the
franchising
authority
would
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
lot
of
reasons
you
can
think
of,
aren't
there?
i
mean...
but
none
of
these
really
appears,
as
far
as
we
know,
in
any
of
the
debates.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
lot
more
expensive
to...
both
to
install
and
operate,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
you
get
a
wire
for
a
couple
of
dollars.
justice
antonin
scalia
virtually
costless.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
think
a
state
can
choose
to
regulate
telephones
without
regulating
cable?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
yes,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
but
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
let
me
use
another
example.
you
think
that
a
state
or
the
federal
government
could
choose
to
regulate
wire
communications
without
regulating
nonwire
communications.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
going
to
answer
my
question?
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
if
you
have,
i
don't
know
whether
it's
yes
or
no.
can
a
state
or
the
federal
government
choose
to
regulate
wire
communications
and
not
regulate
nonwire
communications,
or
vice
versa?
can
it
distinguish
between
the
two
media,
yes
or
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
one's
over
the
air,
one
isn't
over
the
air.
one's
in
wire,
the
other
isn't
in
wire.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
costlow,
what
does
an
smatv
company
do?
they
construct
the
dish,
and
then
they
continue...
they
decide
what
programming
goes
through
the
dish.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
they
competitive?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
a
number
of
competitors
that
come
to
buildings
and
say,
we'd
like
to
run
an
smatv
service?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
now,
if
i'm
a
property
owner
that
owns
a
whole
square
block...
i
own
all
the
buildings
in
the
block...
i
would
assume
i
have
pretty
good
bargaining
power
with
the
various
smatv
companies,
right?
i
can
pretty
much
say,
you
know,
i'd
like
to
get
it
at
such-and-such
a
price,
i
assume,
if
i
have
a
whole
city
block
in
new
york,
who's
all
commonly
owned,
i
control
a
whole
block.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
that's
true,
but
now
let's
assume
that
the
block
is
not
all
owned
by
one
person.
there
are
a
hundred
different
buildings
on
the
block.
one
of
the
buildings
signs
up
with
a
particular
smatv
company.
do
you
think
that
there's
any
chance
that
the
remaining
99
buildings
on
the
block
will
have
a
realistic
choice
which
smatv
company
they
can
use?
i
mean,
doesn't
the
smatv
company
that
signs
up
the
first
building
have
a
lock
on
all
other
99,
because
it
costs
a
couple
of
bucks
to
just
join
the
next
building
with
a
cable?
how
can
any
of
the
other
smatv
companies
hope
to
compete
within
that
block?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
now
of
separately
owned
buildings.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
were
commonly
owned,
as
i
say,
there'd
be
some
bargaining
power
at
the
outset,
but
one
building
gets
the
system.
how
can
any
of
the
other
companies
hope
to
compete
for
the
other
99?
your
company,
if
you're
the
one
that
gets
the
first
one,
you
have
a
lock
on
the
other
99
buildings.
it
costs
you
a
couple
of
feet
of
cable,
that's
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
right,
but
he's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
he's
regulated.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he's
regulated--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
that's
all
they're
trying
to
do
here...
regulate
the
smatv
provider.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
lot
more
expensive.
the
monopoly
differential
is
not
as
great.
it
costs
them,
to
serve
each
additional
building,
a
lot
more
energy,
whereas
you
just
buy
a
couple
of
feet
of
wire
and
you've
got
the
new
building.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
be,
ma'am,
but
you
see,
now,
i
didn't
know
that,
and
maybe
a
reasonably
informed
legislator
wouldn't
know
that,
and
would
think,
gee,
if
i'm...
you
know,
if
i'm
a
company
trying
to
compete
with
another
company
who's
gotten
one
building
in
the
block,
i'm
just
out
of
competition,
because
they
only
have
to...
i
can
see
a
legislator
thinking
that
and
saying,
that's
sort
of
a
monopoly
situation
that
we
ought
to
allow
to
be
regulated.
i
may
be
wrong,
but
i
can't
say
that
it's
off
the
scope.
justice
antonin
scalia
with
wireless,
i
guess
you
can...
can
you
get...
does
wireless
use
the
public
right-of-way
if
you
shoot
it
across
a
street?
is
that
considered
to
be
using
the
public
right-of-way?
it's
not
really
using
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
the
distinction
between
wireless
and
cable
simply
the
distinction
that
it
cost
more,
that
you
do
not...
the
single
system
that
has
sold
its
service
to
one
building
on
the
block
has...
if
it
can
connect
by
wire,
it
has
a
monopoly
over
all
the
other
buildings
on
the
block.
other
cable
systems
cannot...
other
smatv
systems
can't
hope
to
get
their
business.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
you
made
them
do
it
by
wireless,
the
other
systems
might
well
come
in.
isn't
that
enough
of
a
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
you
could...
there
is
such
a
thing
as
franchising
the
ownership
of
television
sets.
i
mean,
the
way
public
television
is
supported
in
england
is
by...
you
have
to
get
a
franchise
to
own
a
television
set.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
that
there's
any
necessary
connection
between
franchising
and
public
property.
you
can
franchise
things
that
occur
only
on
private
property.
you
can
franchise
certain
businesses.
you
can't
run
a
certain
business
on
private
property.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
it
does.
it
gives
you
the
right
to
connect
other
buildings
that
aren't
owned
by
the
same...
by
common
control
to
connect
other
buildings
with
a
little
piece
of
cable.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
any
private
business
that
is
franchised.
it
doesn't
give
him
the
power
to
sell
something.
he
has
to
find
somebody
who's
willing
to
buy
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
of
course
that's
a
condition
of
a
franchise.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree.
i
think
it
may
be
a
very
bad
idea,
but
one...
that
isn't
the
issue,
is
it?
