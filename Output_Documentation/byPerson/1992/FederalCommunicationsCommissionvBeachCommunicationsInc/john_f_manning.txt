mr.
john
f.
manning
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
divided
panel
of
the
d.c.
circuit
took
the
extraordinary
step
of
invalidating
a
portion
of
an
act
of
congress,
the
cable
act
of
1984,
on
rational
basis
grounds
under
the
fifth
amendment.
in
particular,
the
court
rejected
congress'
judgment
that
there
is
less
reason
for
imposing
a
franchise
requirement
when
cable
facilities
serve
only
commonly
owned,
controlled,
or
managed
multiple-unit
dwellings.
instead,
the
court
concluded
that
the
only
rational
dividing
line
between
franchised
and
unfranchised
facilities
in
the
use
of
public
rights-of-way.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
redrafting
the
reasonable
line
drawn
by
congress
in
defining
the
term,
1984.
the
crux
of
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
proper
classification
of
satellite
master
antenna
television,
or
smatv.
unlike
traditional
cable
systems,
which
pick
up
distant
signals
at
a
remote
antenna
and
transmit
them
to
the
community
through
wires
running
under
or
over
the
city
streets,
an
smatv
facility
typically
sets
up
a
rooftop
antenna
and
then
transmits
programming
by
wire
to
units
in
a
building
or
group
of
buildings.
in
enacting
the
cable
act
of
1984,
congress
had
to
decide
whether
and
when
an
smatv
system
should
be
treated
like
a
traditional
cable
facility
and
made
subject
to
franchise
requirements.
contrary
to
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
the
line
drawn
by
congress
was
a
reasonable
one:
an
smatv
system
is
exempt
from
any
franchise
requirement
if
the
system
serves
only
multiple-unit
dwellings
under
common
ownership,
control,
or
management,
and
uses
no
public
rights
of
way.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
the
crux
of
this
case
is
what
a
cable
system
is,
and
a
cable
system
determines...
one's
status
as
a
cable
system
determines
whether
one
is
subject
to
franchise
requirements,
but
there
are
also
other
federal
requirements
that
apply
to
cable
systems
as
well,
such
as--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--there
are--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--that's
right.
there
are,
for
example,
technical
requirements
dealing
with
signal
interference,
with
the
quality
of
the
signal,
and
there
are
other
requirements
pertaining
to
rate
regulation
and
so
forth
that
apply
to
cable
systems,
but
the
only
thing
that's
at
issue
here
is
whether
it's
constitutional
to
impose
a
franchise
requirement
on
an
smatv
facility
that
serves
only
commonly-owned
buildings.
in
enacting
the
so-called
private
cable
exemption
with
its
common-ownership
requirement,
congress
made
the
judgment
that
it
did
not
want
to
impose
franchise
requirements
on
a
building
owner
or
condominium
association
that
decides
to
put
a
satellite
antenna
on
the
building
and
provide
cable
television
to
its
residents,
perhaps
as
an
amenity.
mr.
john
f.
manning
under
47
u.s.c.
section
541,
congress
has
provided
that
with
the
exception
of
facilities
that
are
grandfathered
under
subsection
(b)
of
that
section,
a
cable
operator...
that
is,
a
person
who
operates
a
cable
system...
must
obtain
a
franchise
before
beginning
to
provide
cable
service.
mr.
john
f.
manning
franchise...
a
franchising
authority...
it's
not
clear
what
they
mean
by
franchise.
the
act
describes
a
franchise
authority
as
a
federal,
state,
or
local
authority
that
has
power
to
issue
a
license,
but
in
practice
what
it
means
is
a
state
or
local
franchise,
not
a
federal
franchise,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
manning
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
it's
a
state
or
local...
in
practice
a
state
or
local
franchise
requirement,
and
what
congress
decided
was
that
if
a
building
owner
or
a
condo
association
decides
to
put
a
satellite
dish
on
the
roof
of
the
building
and
provide
cable
service
to
its
tenants,
then
that
would
not
be
subject
to
a
local
franchise
requirement.
similarly,
if
the
same
building
owner
or
condo
association
ran
a
couple
of
buildings,
or
ran
a
building
complex
and
put
a
satellite
antenna
on
the
roof
to
provide
cable
television
to
all
the
residents
in
the
complex,
that
also
would
not
be
subject
to
a
local
franchise
requirement.
but
where
a
satellite
antenna
is
set
up
to
serve
multiple,
separately-owned
buildings,
or
if
its
wires
run
over
or
under
the
city
streets,
congress
made
the
determination
that
the
facility
looks
more
like
a
traditional
cable
system
and
should
be
subject
to
franchise
requirements
accordingly.
mr.
john
f.
manning
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
manning
that's
correct,
and
it
could
be...
as
your
question
suggests--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--it
could
be
quite
a
number
of
people,
and
the
judgment
that
congress
made,
that
the
common-ownership
requirement
in
addition
to
the
right-of-way
requirement
was
a
rational
basis
for
distinguishing
between
franchised
and
unfranchised
facilities,
was
a
reasonable
line.
the
essence
of
the
rational-basis
test
is
that
debatable
policy
judgments
are
left
to
congress,
not
the
federal
courts,
and
as
this
court
explained
most
recently
in
sullivan
v.
stroop,
a
classification
in
a
piece
of
socioeconomic
legislation
must
be
sustained
if
any
state
of
facts
may
reasonably
be
conceived
to
justify
it.
under
that
standard,
the
line-drawn
by
congress
in
this
case
easily
passes
constitutional
muster.
if
a
satellite
antenna
serves
only
a
commonly
owned
building
or
set
of
buildings,
a
plausible
legislator
could
think
that
it
is
more
likely
that
the
service
is
being
provided
as
part
of
the
package
of
services
that
management
provides
to
its
residents,
that
it's
an
incident
of
residency.
equivalently,
a
reasonable
legislator
could
conclude
that
the
service
provided
by
such
a
satellite
antenna
would
be
less
likely
to
be
run
in
the
nature
of
an
independent
business
venture,
but
even
if
you
take
a
building
complex--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
you
would
think
that
if
you
were
an
owner
of
a
building
and
you
were
putting
up
a
satellite
dish
and
providing
the
service
to
your
tenants,
that
your
primary
interest
would
be
in
keeping
your
tenants
happy,
because
you
are
making
a
lot
more
money
from
their
rent,
or
from
their
condo
fee,
than
you
are
from
providing
them
with
cable
service.
so
in
that
situation,
you
could
conclude
that
there
would
be
less
need
to
interpose
a
franchising
authority
to
provide
consumer
protection,
when
the
building
itself
is
really
the
provider
of
the
service.
but
even
if
you
have
a
situation
where
the
building
is
making
a
contract
with
an
outside
smatv
company
to
set
up
a
satellite
antenna
on
the
building,
to
run
the
wires,
own
the
wires,
service
the
building,
arrange
for
the
programming,
and
bill
the
tenants
separately,
that
company
is
still
accountable
to
one
set
of
owners
for
the
service
that
it
provides
from
that
dish.
every
subscriber
who
gets
service
off
of
that
satellite
antenna
can
voice
his
or
her
complaints
or
desires
to
a
single
set
of
owners,
and
the
ownership
has
a
strong
incentive
to
keep
the
subscribers
happy,
since
there
is
a
substantial
interest
in
keeping
the
rental
fees
and
the
condo
fees
flowing.
mr.
john
f.
manning
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
i
mean,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
a
single
business,
but
it
would
be
a
single...
a
single
building...
i'm
sorry,
a
single
building,
but
it
would
be
a
building
or
building
complex.
and
what
you
would
do
is,
you
would...
it
would
involve
the
construction
of
a
satellite
head
end,
and
it
may
or
may
not
involve
wiring
the
buildings,
because
a
lot
of
these
buildings
have
the
old
mater
antenna
television
system
wiring
already
in
place,
so
you
might
or
might
not
be
able
to
use
that.
so
there
is
a
substantial
investment
in
building
the
satellite
head
end
facility,
and
if
you
were
serving
a
single
set
of
buildings,
and
the
ownership
cancels
that
contract,
then
you've
lost
out
a
lot.
mr.
john
f.
manning
right,
whereas
if
you're
serving
10
different
buildings,
then
no
one
owner
has
that
degree
of
leverage
over
your
service.
and
what's
more,
if
a
satellite
antenna
is
not
limited
to
serving
commonly
owned
buildings,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
it
may
well
be
expected,
or
a
reasonable
legislature
could
at
least
think
that
you
would
tend
to
have
more
subscribers
served
by
that
satellite
antenna,
because
you
could
wire
an
entire
city
block
in
new
york
by
running
a
wire
from
building
to
building.
in
that
case--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--the
owner
would
have
substantial
leverage,
because
the
alternative
for
any
of
the
buildings
on
that
block--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--would
be
to
build
your
own
system.
mr.
john
f.
manning
and
now,
i
would
like
to--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--that's
exactly
right,
and
you
could
have...
a
franchise
authority
with
consumer
protection
jurisdiction
could
more
profitably
exercise
control
over
the
rates
and
consumer
service
of
a
satellite
antenna
that
serves
separately
owned
buildings.
and
what's
more,
if
you
assume,
as
a
reasonable
legislator
could,
that
the
size
of
the
market
served
by
that
facility,
served
by
that
head
end
satellite
antenna
equipment,
is
larger
if
the
common-ownership
requirement
is
not
met,
then
the
costs
of
franchising
could
be
spread
among
a
greater
number
of
consumers,
and
so
congress
could
have
reasoned
that
the
cost-benefit
ratio
of
imposing
a
franchise
requirement
on
a
facility
that
serves
separately
owned
buildings
would
be
more
favorable.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
made
perfectly
clear
in
a
number
of
cases,
most
recently
nordlinger
v.
hahn,
but
perhaps
most
clearly
in
the
case
of
railroad
retirement
board
v.
fritz,
that
the
rationale
for
a
piece
of
legislation
does
not
have
to
appear
in
the
legislative
history
or
even
in
purposes
articulated
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
that
issue
was
raised
very
clearly
in
the
fritz
case,
where
the
dissent
said
that
the
evidence
in
that
case
involved
a
question
of
line-drawing
between
those
who
would
be
eligible
for
dual
benefits
under
the
social
security
system
and
the
railroad
retirement
system
and
those
who
would
not
be
eligible
for
that
double-dipping,
and
congress
drew
a
line
based
on
whether
one
was
serving
in
the...
to
summarize
very
sketchily,
whether
one
was
serving
in
the
railroad
industry
or
had
a
current
connection
in
1974.
the
dissent
said
that
that
line
disserved
the
purposes
of
the
statute
as
expressed
in
the
legislative
history
because
it
didn't
provide
all
of
the
people
who
had
vested
railroad
retirement
benefits
with
their
ultimate
benefits,
and
this
court
said
that
the
purposes
of
a
statute
for
purposes
of
the
rational-basis
test
did
not
have
to
be
reflected
in
the
legislative
history,
and
that
it
was
"constitutionally
irrelevant
whether
the
rational
basis
was
articulated
by
the
legislature
at
all.
"
the
court
also
stated
that
the
best
evidence
of
the
legislative
purpose
is
the
text
of
the
statute
itself.
mr.
john
f.
manning
that's
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
very
difficult...
as
this
court
has
explained
many
times,
it's
very
difficult
to
know
precisely
why
a
legislator
is
moved
to
vote
for
or
against
a
particular
piece
of
legislation,
and
if
the
rationality
of
a
statute
were
measured
in
terms
of
the
reasons
suggested
by
some
legislators
on
the
floor
or
by
a
committee
in
a
report,
it
would
be
very
difficult
indeed
to
sustain
the
validity
of
much
legislation,
and
it
would
be
quite
an
impingement
on
the
independence
of
the
legislative
branch.
in
rejecting
the
rational
justification,
what
we
call
the
consumer
welfare
rationale,
the
court
of
appeals
offered
very
little
explanation
in
this
case.
consumer
welfare
rationale
was
suggested
by
judge
mikva,
chief
judge
mikva
in
his
concurring
opinion,
and
endorsed
by
the
fcc
on
remand.
rather
than
addressing
the
substance
of
that
justification,
the
court
of
appeals
merely
dismissed
it
by
saying,
we
have
no
basis
for
assuming
its
validity,
and
by
calling
it
a
fcc
has
wholly
failed
to
flesh
out.
mr.
john
f.
manning
that's
correct.
mr.
john
f.
manning
there
are
a
number
of
these
condominium
associations,
but--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--that
i'm
not
certain
of,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well,
i
think
the
thing
that
makes
them
a
market
is
that
what
you're
talking
about
when
you're
talking
about
a
facility,
which
is
the
unit
that
you
use
to
measure
whether
something's
a
cable
system,
you're
talking
about
the
hardware,
the
satellite
antenna
system,
and
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
if
you
have
a
building,
you
have
a
satellite
antenna
that's
placed
on
a
building,
then
the
people
who
own
that
building
and--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
sure
what
you're
asking.
if
you
have
a
complex
of
buildings...
if
you
have
the
same
10
buildings,
and
in
one
case
it's
owned
by
a
single
owner--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--you
have
a
satellite
dish
on
building
1.
it
serves
all
10
buildings.
mr.
john
f.
manning
the
same
set
of
10
buildings
are
all
separately
owned.
you
have
the
satellite
dish
on
building
1
and
a
wire
is
run
among
all
10.
mr.
john
f.
manning
why...
that
is
the
same
market
in
each
case,
but--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
i
think
that
it
stands
to
reason...
now,
the
record
does
not
reflect
what
the
actual
practice
is.
mr.
john
f.
manning
the
theory
is
that
congress
must
have
thought
that
when
you're
putting
the
satellite
dish
on
your
own
buildings--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--that
would
have
to
be
the
theory,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
f.
manning
i
think
that
it's
debatable,
which
is
the
only
thing
that's
required
under
the
rational-basis
test.
i
mean,
you
and
i
may
disagree
just
as
the--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
the
support
is
common
sense
and
the
way
the
world
works.
i
mean,
we
may
differ
in
what
we
think
the
right
answer
is
to
whether
you'll
get
a
better
deal
if
you're
served
by
a
satellite
antenna
that
only
serves
people
in
your
building
or
if
you're
served
by
a
satellite
antenna
that
serves
you
and
10
other
buildings,
and
we
may
disagree
over
whether
the
person
in
building
1
has
more
leverage
because
it's
part
of
a
collection
of
10
buildings
that
negotiate
as
one
for
the
service
as
opposed
to
10
separate
negotiators
for
the
same
service--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--again,
the
record
is
not
clear,
and
the
crux
of
the
rational-basis
test
is
that
congress
is
not
disabled
from
legislating
unless
it
can...
it
is
not
disabled
from
legislating
at
the
risk
of
not
being
able
to
prove
that
its
policy
judgments
are
empirically
justifiable
or
even
correct.
that
is
the
very
clear
import--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
i
mean,
if
you
just
take
a
case
like
railway
express
agency
v.
new
york,
in
that
case
new
york
city
passed
an
ordinance,
and
the
ordinance
provided
that
there
was
to
be
a
ban
on
advertising
on
trucks,
but
the
ordinance
also
exempted
self-advertisements
on
the
same
trucks.
the
court
said...
the
court
upheld
that
classification
on
the
ground
that
a
legislator
may
well
assume
that
those
who
advertise
their
own
wares
present
less
of
a
traffic
safety
concern
given
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
advertisements
on
their
trucks.
there
was
no
record
support
for
that.
they
didn't
cite
any
scholarly
treatises,
they
didn't
cite
any
traffic
reports,
any
economic
textbooks.
what
the
court
did
was,
it
indulged
in
the
democratic
process
by
accepting
plausible
although
unverified
assumptions
about
the
way
the
world
works.
mr.
john
f.
manning
we
think
it's
very
plausible
to
think
that.
we
think
that
a
reasonable
legislator
certainly
could
assume
that
when
you
have
a
satellite
dish
that's
being
put
on
a
building
that
a)
it's
more
likely
that
the
satellite
service
is
being
offered
as
an
amenity
to
the
tenants,
that
it
may
not
even
be
a
separate
market
where
the
smatv
company
comes
in,
puts
on
the
satellite,
bills
the
tenants
and
runs
it
separately.
but
secondly,
we
think
it's
much
more
likely
that
when
you
have
the
negotiation
focused
between
one
set
of
owners
for
use
of
this
very
expensive
piece
of
hardware
and
a
satellite
company,
even
if
it
runs
a
hundred
of
these
satellite
dishes
around
town,
that
the
people
who
live
within
that
building
are
more
likely
to
have
leverage
over
the
product
consumed
than
if
you
have
the
same
company
putting
a
dish
on
and
running
it
to
10
buildings.
not
only
is
the
accountability
more
focused,
but
if
a
satellite
dish
can
only
serve
multiple-unit
dwellings,
it
is
more
likely
that
you
are
going
to
have
fewer
subscribers,
and
that
means
that
each
subscriber
is
going
to
have
more
leverage
over
the
product
produced,
and
that
the
cost
of
franchising
will
be
more
significant
for...
per
subscriber
for
subscribers
who
live
in
buildings
under
common
ownership.
mr.
john
f.
manning
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
raised
the
question
whether
a
fundamental
rights
equal
protection
analysis
should
be
applied,
but
the
court
did
not
reach
that
question,
and
we
believe
that
the
court
should
leave
it
for
the
court
of
appeals
in
first...
in
the
first--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
the...
this
court's
cases
suggest
that...
no,
we...
actually,
we
have
not
taken
a
position
in
that
case,
and
we
would
prefer
that
the
court
not
address
that
issue
because
it
has
not
been
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
think
it
would
be
preferable
to
leave
it
for
consideration
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand.
mr.
john
f.
manning
we
don't
have
a
position,
no.
in...
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals'
error
in
this
case
stemmed
largely
from
the
fact
that
it
perceived
that
the
line
drawn
by
congress
was
different
than
the
line
traditionally
applied
by
the
administrative
agency
in
deciding
whether
the
franchise
requirement
should
be
applied...
namely,
the
crossing
of
public
rights-of-way.
the
fcc's
traditional
basis
for
imposing
franchise
requirements
on
cable
facilities,
however,
is
irrelevant
to
the
constitutional
question
before
this
court.
congress
has
no
constitutional
duty
to
adhere
to
agency
precedent
or
even
to
give
a
reasoned
explanation
for
departing
from
it.
in
any
case,
it
is
wrong
to
say
that
the
only
dividing
line
for
franchise
requirements
had
been
the
use
of
public
rights-of-way.
under
fcc
regulations
in
the
1970's,
a
facility
that
did
not
satisfy
the
common-ownership
requirement
could
be
classified
as
a
cable
system
and
thus
made
subject
to
franchise
requirements
whether
or
not
it
crossed
public
rights-of-way.
that
ruling
is
reflected
in
the
fcc's
bayhead
decision
which
is
cited
in
footnote
26
of
our
brief.
in
addition,
the
fcc's
1983
earth
satellite
decision
confirms
that
the
commission
never
preempted
franchise
requirements
for
the
type
of
facility
at
issue
here...
smatv
facilities
that
serve
separately
owned
buildings
by
wire.
mr.
john
f.
manning
certainly.
mr.
john
f.
manning
the
common-ownership
requirement
we
use
as
a
shorthand
for
common-ownership
control
or
management,
so
that
a
condominium
association
that
had
multiple
units
that
were
under
the
control
or
management
of
a
condo
association
would
satisfy
the
common-ownership
requirement,
as
we
call
it.
mr.
john
f.
manning
if
they
had
an
association--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--i
think
it
probably
would
not
count.
i
think
that
what...
it's
not
clear
from
the
fcc's
precedents,
but
i
would
think
that
an
organization
that
was
formed
simply
to,
in
effect,
evade
the
franchise
requirement
would
be
insufficient
to
do
so
under
the
fcc's
regulations.
mr.
john
f.
manning
yes,
but
the
common
ownership
control
and
management
requirement
generally
means
that
you
have
a
bunch
of
units
that
are
joined
by
a
common
economic
link,
that
the
management
is
providing
a
number
of
services.
it
collects
garbage,
it
may
provide
plumbing
services,
it
may
provide
an
answering
service
at
the
front
desk
that
serves
all
these
units.
so
there
is
an
integrated
economic
unit.
there's
something
that
holds
these
units
together,
and
when
that's
the
case,
i
think
that
what
the
common-ownership
requirement
does
is,
it
gives
some
assurance
the
cable
system
is
simply--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
if
it's
simply
another
incident
of
a
number
of
services
that
are
provided
by
the
same
group
in
common--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
the
more...
i
mean,
the
question
is,
when
do
you
have
something
under
common
management
for
purposes
of
the
rule,
and
certainly
the
more
services
that
you
add
on
that
are
handled
in
common,
the
more
that
it
looks
as
if
these
buildings
are
under
common
management
for
some
purposes.
i'm
not--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--i'm
not--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
exactly
where
the
line
would
be
drawn,
but
i
think
the
proper
test
would
be
whether
one
could
say
that,
apart
from
the
cable
television
services,
that
there
is
a
substantial
and
bona
fide
common
management
or
control
of
the
buildings.
mr.
john
f.
manning
well--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--when
the--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--well,
i
mean
the
question
is
not
the
constitutional
question
here
but
the
question
of
how
to
interpret
the
regulation,
and
it's
true
that
perhaps
a
group
of
people
could
get
together
and
in
some
cases
negotiate
together
to
provide
for
cable
services.
but
congress
doesn't
have
to
draw
perfect
classifications,
and
what
it
decided
was
that
it
was
going
to
use
common
ownership
control
and
management
in
general
as
a
proxy
for
those
situations
when
all
the
tenants
together
have
sufficient
focus
and
accountability
and
bargaining
power
to
get
the
services
they
want
with
the
proper
consumer
responsiveness.
if
there
are
no
further--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--no,
your
honor.
the
definition
goes
back
to
1965.
in
the
first
set
of
cable
rules,
there
was
what
was
called
an
apartment
house
exception
that
went
through
some
changes
that
are
not
material
here.
along
the
way,
they
had
a
common
ownership--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--in
those
days,
the
exception
applied
mainly
to
what's
known
as
master
antenna
television,
which
was
an
antenna
that
was
put
on
the
roof
and
wired
to
buildings
to
get
broadcast
signals
so
that
you
wouldn't
have
a
forest
of
antennas.
satellite
antenna...
satellite
master
antenna
television
was
developed
in
the
late
1970's,
but
in
the
earth
satellite
decision
in
1983
the
commission
made
very
clear
that
the
common
ownership
exemption
clause--
mr.
john
f.
manning
--there
were
two
other
cases
that
raised
statutory
questions
of
whether
an
smatv
facility
would
be
a
cable
system.
those
were
two
district
court
cases
which
are
cited
in
the
fcc
opinion.
this
is
the
first
constitutional
challenge
to
that
distinction.
mr.
john
f.
manning
congress
passed
the
cable
act
of
1984,
in
which
it
adopted
the
common
ownership
exception,
and
in
1992
it
passed
another
cable
act
in
which
it
left
the
exemption
unchanged.
mr.
john
f.
manning
the
fcc
report
on
remand
says
that
the
matter
in
this
case
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
committee,
but
i'm
aware
of
no
testimony
that
relates
to
the
question
whether
to
retain
the
common
exemption.
mr.
john
f.
manning
the
commission
initially
took
the
position
in
interpreting
the
19...
you
mean
in
the
1992
legislation?
mr.
john
f.
manning
1965,
in
the
commission's
first
set
of
rules,
yes.
mr.
john
f.
manning
they...
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
