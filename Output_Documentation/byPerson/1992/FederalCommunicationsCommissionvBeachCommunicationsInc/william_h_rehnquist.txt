chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
number
92-603,
the
federal
communications
commission
and
the
united
states
v.
beach
communications,
inc.--
mr.
manning.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mann,
when
you
are
talking
about
a
franchise
requirement,
are
you
talking
about
a
requirement
imposed
by
congress,
or
a
requirement
that...
franchise
that
allows
local
governments
to
impose?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
a
franchise
from
the
federal
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
although
the
act
may
not
be
clear,
that
is
in
practice
what
happens.
if
you're
subject
to
this
requirement
you
must
get
a
franchise
from
a
state
or
local
government.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
virtue
of
that
conclusion,
that
it
would
be
less
likely
to
be
run
as
an
independent
business
venture?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
lots
of
times
a
bill
starts
out
intending
to
do
one
thing
and
amendments
are
tacked
on,
so
there
may
be
several
different
purposes
not
necessarily
consistent
with
one
another.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
manning.
ms.
costlow,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
costlow,
what
are
the
practical
consequences
when
a
franchise
is
required?
does
that
mean
that
a
cable
operator
will
be
subject
to
price
regulation
by
the
state
or
local
government?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
include
some
sort
of
the
price
regulation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
line
of
cases
from
this
court
that
say
that
the
legislature
can
confront
evils
one
step
at
a
time
and
you
know,
make
exceptions
if
it
wants
to?
it
doesn't
have
to
sweep
every
piece
off
the
chessboard
when
it
tries.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
maybe
this...
maybe
congress
is
in
the
process
of
changing
its
mind
and
is
beginning
to
go
the
other
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
congress
isn't
bound
by
previous
fcc
decisions.
i
mean,
congress
may
have
decided,
look,
maybe
we
want
to
get
the
states
and
local
governments
into
some
regulation.
let's
try
it
out
in
this
area
and
see
how
it
works.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
costlow,
has
your
client
applied
for
a
franchise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
answer
is
no,
it
has
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no,
i
don't
see
that
you
should
have
to
explain...
i
mean,
if
it
hasn't,
it
hasn't.
my
point
is
that
you
really
don't
know,
then,
what
requirements
any
particular
franchise
you
applied
for
might
be...
might
subject
you
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i...
any...
i
mean,
where
does
your
client
want
to
have
its
services?
i
mean,
what
geographical
area?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
know
without
having
applied
for
a
franchise
in
san
diego
what
sort
of
requirements
you
would
be
subject
to
by
that
franchise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
other
49
states
in
which
you
might
want
to
do
business?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
