ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
of
all
interstate
media
of
communications
not
using
the
public
streets
and
rights-of-way
to
deliver
their
signal,
only
a
single
media...
that
is,
an
smatv
facility
serving
separately
owned
and
managed
multiple
dwelling
units
by
wire
has
to
obtain
a
franchise
from
a
municipality
in
order
to
enter
the
market
and
is
subjected
to
treatment
as
a
cable
system.
no
franchise
is
required
of
an
smatv
facility
serving
a
single
multiple-unit
dwelling.
no
franchise
is
required
for
that
same
smatv
operator
to
install
a
series
of
separate
satellite
dishes
in
order
to
serve
the
exact
same
apartment
dwellings
throughout
the
municipality.
no
franchise
is
required
if
an
smatv
operator
wishes
to
interconnect
separately
owned
or
managed
buildings
by
means
of
an
18-gigahertz
microwave
link.
no
franchise
is
required
of
an
smatv
facility
who
seeks
to
interconnect
those
same
separately
owned
or
managed
multiple
dwelling
units
by
means
of
an
infrared
link.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
the
burdens
that
would
be
imposed
upon
an
smatv
facility
that
would
have
to
obtain
a
franchise
would
be
the
same
burdens
that
would
be
imposed
upon
traditional
cable
operators,
but
those
burdens
would
not
apply
to
any
other
interstate
media
of
communications.
those
burdens
would
include,
for
example,
having
to
get
a
license
to
speak
at
all.
if
the
license
is
denied,
then
you
cannot
speak.
those
burdens
would
include,
on
the
local
level,
typically
a
requirement
to
wire
the
entire
municipality,
not
simply
to
obtain
a
franchise
to
interconnect
the
particular
separately
owned
multiple-unit
dwellings
that
the
operator
wishes
to
interconnect.
it
would
also
include--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--yes,
it
would
include
price
regulation
as
a
result
of
the
'92
act,
depending
upon
whether
or
not
under
the
statute
that
particular
market
and
the
players
within
that
market
are
subject
to
effective
competition.
they
would
always
be
subject
to
potential
regulation
on
the
federal
level
by
treatment
as
a
cable
system
because,
as
a
result
of
the
'92
act,
any
subscriber
can
bring
a
complaint
to
the
federal
communications
commission
that
the
rates
of
the
particular
operator
are
unreasonable,
and
that
kind
of
price
and
rate
regulation
is
not
imposed
upon
smatv
facilities
serving
a
single
building,
serving
commonly
owned
or
managed
buildings,
serving
those
same
buildings
by
means
of
microwave
or
an
infrared
link,
leasing
telephone
company
lines,
for
example,
in
order
to
interconnect
those
buildings,
because
you
don't
have
to
obtain
a
franchise
to
do
that.
in
other
words,
the
only
time
a
franchise
is
required
to
interconnect
separately
owned
and
managed
buildings
is
when
those
separately
owned
and
managed
buildings
are
interconnected
by
a
simple
piece
of
wire,
so
the
exact
distinction
here
is
that
you
cannot
cross
a
public...
a
private
property
boundary
line
in
order
to
serve
separately
owned
or
managed
buildings
by
means
of
a
wire,
but
you
can
cross
that
same
private
property
boundary
line
to
interconnect
those
same
separately
owned
and
managed
multiple-unit
dwellings
by
means
of
a
wireless
facility.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
it
is
obviously
interconnecting
separately
owned
or
managed
buildings
by
means
of
a
piece
of
cable
will
be
cheaper
in
all
instances
for
any--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--i
think
it's
6
or
12
cents
a
foot,
your
honor,
depending
on
how
much
cable
is
used.
the
distinguishing
characteristics
here
between
the
media
who
are
subject
to
franchising
requirements
and
the
media
who
are
not
subject
to
franchising
requirements,
i
do
not
believe
that
you
should
focus
simply
on
an
smatv
facility
versus
another
smatv
facility,
but
must
look
at
the
entire
interstate
media
that
is
potentially
regulated
as
a
result
of
the
communications
act
and
the
cable
television
acts
which
were
a
part
of
that
act.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
telephone
companies,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
there
are
incidences
of
telephone
companies
that
are
both
intrastate
and
interstate
service,
and
so
there
has
been
a
dual
regulatory
scheme
adopted
for
telephones--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--precisely
because
of
that.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
i
believe
that
the
feds
and
the...
the
federal
government
or
the
state
government
cannot
discriminate
in
the
circumstances
in
which
they
regulate
particular
speakers.
in
other
words,
if
there
are
no
distinguishing
characteristics
between
the
various
interstate
media
of
communications,
then
i
submit
that
it
is
impermissible
to
apply
a
particular
set
of
burdens
and
to
single
out--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
thought
that
i
was
answering
your
question.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
i
must
be
misunderstanding
your
question.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
yes,
but
may
i
offer
an
explanation?
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
the
explanation
is
that
they
can
distinguish
between
those
two
media
only
if
there
are
distinguishing
characteristics
that
provide
a
justification
for
distinguishing
between
those
media.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
but
that
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
whether
you
are
operating
a
multipoint,
multichannel
distribution
service
or
whether
or
not
you
are
operating
an
smatv
service,
you
are
offering
news,
entertainment,
and
information
on
a
multichannel
system.
you
could
have
exactly
the
same
programming
services
offered
to
subscribers,
and
i
submit
that
the
fact
that
you
choose
a
particular
technology,
meaning
a
wire,
versus
a
particular
technology,
which
is
microwave,
to
deliver
those
exact
same
services
to
consumers,
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
your
honor,
it
is
true
that
congress
can
act
one
step
at
a
time,
but
if
you
look
at
the
particular
background
and
history
and
context
of
this
particular
regulation,
the...
neither
the
federal
government
nor
congress
have
ever
subjected
interstate
media
of
communications
operating
by
wireless,
for
example,
to
local
franchising
regulation.
they
have
not
subjected
to
local
franchising
regulation
smatv
facilities
serving
multiple-unit
dwellings
either
singly
or
under
common
ownership
management
or
control,
so
the
step
here...
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
is
moving
one
step
at
a
time
to
subject
each
of
these
interstate
media
to
some
sort
of
local
franchising
regulation.
the
step
is
in
the
opposite
direction.
all
interstate
media
have
typically
been
exempt
from
local
regulation
and
exclusively
under
federal
jurisdiction
and
control,
and
only
in
a
very
rare
instance
has
the
federal
government
conceded
or
permitted
local
jurisdiction
and
control
over
an
interstate
media
of
communications.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
your
honor,
the
fcc
has
never
done
so.
the
fcc's
orth-o-vision
decision
was
issued
in
1978,
which
specifically
preempted
local
regulation
and
control--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--your
honor,
congress
in
1984
chose
to
adopt
the
orth-o-vision
decision
and
exempt
wireless
from
regulation.
they
just
the
1992
cable
act,
and
in
that
act
they
again
did
not
subject
any
sort
of
wireless
facilities
to
local
franchising
regulation,
so
that
over
the
course
of
the
entire
history
of
when
each
of
these
media
have
come
into
the
marketplace,
congress
has
not
determined
to
impose
local
franchising
regulation
unless
such
facilities
used
a
public
street
or
right-of-way,
except
in
this
one,
single
instance.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
no,
your
honor,
there
is
not.
i
must
admit
that
there
is
evidence
that
the...
at
least
in
the
context,
that
the...
that
congress'
reason
for
exempting
smatv's
facilities
serving
commonly
owned,
the
exemption
itself
serving
commonly
owned
or
managed
facilities
was
not
system
size,
that
the
reason
for--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--was
not
system
size,
which
is
the
rationale
presented
by
the
government.
what
the
rationale
was
is
that
was
based
on
a
decision
issued
by
the
federal
communications
commission,
the
earth
satellite
decision,
directly
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
1984
cable
act.
and
that
decision
exempted
these
types
of
facilities
because
they
did
not
use
a
public
street
or
right-of-way,
they
were
indistinguishable
from
wireless,
they
were
there
to
promote
the
open
entry
and
the
unfettered
development
of
interstate
satellite
signals,
and
the
federal
communications
commission
made
a
specific
finding
that
local
franchising
jurisdiction
and
control
acted
as
a
barrier
and
chilled
entry
and
therefore
thwarted
the
fcc's
policy
in
the
unfettered
development
of
interstate
satellite
signals.
congress
in
the...
that
was
a
1983
decision.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
i
don't
think
the
decision
to
exempt
smatv
facilities
serving
commonly
owned
or
managed
buildings
was
irrational.
the
fcc
did
not
reach...
it
specifically
did
not
reach
whether
or
not
it
would
at
some
point
exempt
also
facilities
serving
separately
owned
and
managed
dwellings.
they
didn't
say
that
they
couldn't.
they
just
didn't
reach
it,
and
in
'84
congress
adopted
that
same
exemption--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--that
is
certainly
likely,
your
honor.
the
other
presumption
would
be
that
it
is
irrational
simply
because
those
same
interests
in
which
they--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--your
honor,
the
first
time
congres
legislated
in
this
area
was
'84,
so
when
we
were
speaking
of
the
definition
being
in
existence
since
1965--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--at
the
federal
communications
commission
level,
not
on
the
congressional
level.
the
first
time
congress
legislated
was
in
'84.
when
it
came
up
at
the
fcc
level,
your
honor,
smatv
facilities
did
not
exist.
what
existed
were
master
antenna
television
facilities.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
smatv
did
not
really
come
into
existence--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--there's
nothing
to
show
anything
on
the
record
in
the
legislative
history.
in
1984,
this
is
the
first
time
that
congres
legislated
this
particular
distinction.
when
congress
was
reconsidering
the
cable
act
in
1992,
that
is
the
time
at
which
the
lower
court
here
issued
its
opinion.
that
was
made
known
to
congress.
in
fact,
it
was
made
known
that
they
were
considering
issuing
that
opinion,
and
then
after
the
opinion
was
issued,
that
opinion
was
also
made
known
to
congress,
and
we
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
fact
that
congress
in
1992
knew
of
the
decision
here
and
chose
to
do
nothing
about
it
means
that
in
essence
that
they
have
adopted
the
district
court
ruling
here,
but
there
is
nothing
on
the
record
that
explicitly
says
that.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
your
honor,
i
find
it
implausible
that
if
congress
truly
wanted
to
keep
this
distinction,
and
this
distinction
had
been
held
unconstitutional
by
the
district
of
columbia
circuit,
that
congress
would
have
gambled
on
the
fact--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--that
this
court
was
grant
cert--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--no...
i'm
sure
they
would
have
gambled
on
this
court
getting
it
right,
and
i
submit
that
getting
it
right
is
affirming
the
decision
below,
but
i
don't
think
that
if
congress
felt
strongly
about
this,
they
would
have
gambled
on
this
court
potentially
denying
cert
and
therefore
not
reaching
the
issue.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
it
is
incorrect
to
assume
that
satellite
master
antenna
television
systems
are
always
landlord-provided.
in
fact,
in
practice,
that
is
less
then
10
percent
of
the
smatv
facilities
that
are
out
there.
these
are
independent
suppliers
of
cable
television
services
and
what
they
do
is
exactly
the
same
thing
that
traditional
cable
does,
that
multipoint,
multichannel
distribution
services
do,
that
18-gigahertz
services
do--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--yes,
they
are
competitive.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
and
i
tell
you
how
they
compete.
they
compete
at
the
property
line.
the
property
owner
looks
out
in
the
marketplace
and
says,
i
can
receive
services
from
traditional
cable,
i
can
receive
them
from
smatv,
i
can
receive
them
from
mmds.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
that
property
owner
has
the
same
bargaining
power
whether
it's
a
traditional
cable,
or
smatv,
or
mmds.
whatever
bargaining
power
the
owner
has--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--are
we
speaking
of
separately
owned
buildings,
or
commonly
owned
buildings?
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
your
honor--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--if
you
can
interconnect
by
wire--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--that
may
be
potentially
true,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
gives
you
a
lot
more
than
the
traditional
cable
operator.
the
traditional
cable
operator
has
already
installed
its
facilities
in
the
public
streets
or
rights-of-way.
all
it
has
to
do
is
run
the
same
cable
to
serve
these
buildings.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
so
their
entry
costs
are
no
greater
than
the
entry
costs--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--of
an
smatv
provider.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
he's
regulated--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--your
honor,
everyone
in
the
market
has
the
potential
to
serve
a
separately
owned
building.
they
have
only
regulated
smatv
operators
who
operate
on
private
property
serving
a
separately
owned
building.
a
wireless
operator
can
serve
a
separately
owned
building
without
becoming
regulated
on
the
local
level.
an
18-gigahertz
operator
can
serve
a
separately
owned
building
without
being
regulated
on
the
local
level,
so
the
fact--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--a
wireless
cable
operator
can
install
service
to
a
multiple
dwelling
unit
for
somewhere
around
$300.
i
don't
see
that
as
a
significant
entry
barrier,
so
that
in
competition
between
a
wireless
cable
operator
meeting
a
multichannel,
multipoint
distribution
service
operator
competing
for
access
to
that
building--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--your
honor,
the
purposes...
i
would
submit
that
the
purposes
of
the
'84
act
as
confirmed
in
the
1992
cable
act
are
a
deregulatory
purpose,
and
the
purpose
of...
set
forth
and
the
objectives
set
forth
in
both
those
acts
by
congress
are
that
they
sought
to
promote
competition
by
free
entry,
not
to
impose
regulations
on
system
or
entry
barriers
to
system.
and
i
would
submit
that
congress
could
not
have
sought
to
promote
competition
in
these
acts
by
means
of
singling
out
only
a
particular
medium
for
this
kind
of
regulation
as
opposed
to
applying
whatever
justifies
regulation
of
us
justifies
regulation
of
other
like-situated
media.
the
system
size
rationale
is
the
rationale
that's
relied
upon
by
the
government
here,
and
i
would
submit
that
that
system
size
rationale
was
expressly
rejected
by
congress
when
it
adopted
the
1984
act.
prior
to
the
1984
act--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--the
government
is
relying
upon
the
fact
that
congress
intended
to
regulate
systems
of
larger
size,
because
systems
of
smaller
size
would
somehow
be
more
subject
to
consumer
control.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
that
is
the
government's
position,
you
are
correct.
i
would
submit,
however,
that
a
consumer
has
as
much
leverage
over
the
owner
of
that
building,
whether
that
owner
of
that
building...
i
mean,
owns
one
building
or
three
buildings.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
the
distinctions
between
different
media
and
who
does
and
does
not
have
to
have
a
franchise,
they
did
not
determine
that
larger
systems
such
as
mmds
or
dbs
or
any
of
the
other
private
property
systems
would
be
subject
to
local
franchising
regulation.
i
would
submit
that
if
congress
were
concerned
that
larger,
multichannel
video
programming
distributors
serving
separately
owned
buildings
because
there
would
be
less
consumer
leverage
should
be
subject
to
local
jurisdiction
and
control,
that
they
would
have
subjected
all
larger
systems
to
such
regulation
and
not
simply
singled
out
this
particular
media.
the
government
does
not
respond
to
that
argument.
the
government
says,
well,
what
they
meant
to
do
there
was
simply
encourage
smatv
facilities,
these
kinds
of
smatv
facilities,
to
migrate
to
wireless
spectrum,
and
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
it
has
never
been
telecommunications
policy
to
encourage
migration
to
scarce
frequencies.
rather,
the
policy
has
been
to
encourage
migration
away
from
such
scarce
frequencies,
and
the
government
has
never,
in
my
mind,
submitted
a
justification
for
the
discriminatory
classification
between
wired
facilities
and
wireless
facilities,
and
i
submit
that
basing
that
on
a
migration
to
wireless
spectrum
analysis
simply
is
implausible.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
that's
exactly
my
point.
none
of
the
facilities
at
issue
here
use
a
public
street
or
right-of-way.
neither
do
these
smatv
facilities.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
i
find
the
fact
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
only
harm
the
market
entry
and
growth
of
smatv
facilities
and
not
somehow...
that
they
just...
they
wanted
to
advance
and
promote
some
technologies
over
others,
or
some
speakers
over
others,
not
to
be
a
plausible
reason
for
congress'
actions
here,
because
if
you
assume
that
congress
meant
to
impose,
on
purpose,
greater
cost
on
smatv
facilities
that
they
did
not
mean
to
impose
on
other
like-situated
media,
your
honor,
i
have
problems
with
that.
i
do
not
believe
that
congress
meant
to
impose
additional
costs,
and
if,
in
fact,
what
congress'
objective
was
here
was
to
ensure
that
these
particular
smatv
facilities
had
to
be
regulated
if
they
got
larger,
then
i
submit
they
haven't
achieved
their
purpose,
because
everyone
can
evade
that
regulation,
including
these
smatv
facilities.
it
may
cost
them
to
evade
that
regulation,
but
they
can
evade
it,
and
they
can
get
as
large
as
they
want,
and
it
just
simply
doesn't
make
sense
to
me
that
if
congress
had
meant
to
subject
larger
systems
to
franchising
regulation,
that
they
wouldn't
have
subjected
all
larger
systems
to
franchising
regulation,
and
it
wouldn't
come
down
to
the
ownership
of
the
building
served,
which
isn't
even
a
characteristic
of
those
various
interstate
media,
and
it
wouldn't
have
come
down
to
whether
or
not
it's
interconnected
by
wire
over
a
private
property
boundary
line.
to
me,
that
is
an
impermissible
distinction,
an
impermissible
line-drawing
between
like
media
of
interstate
communications.
that
line
was
drawn
with
respect
to
traditional
cable
prior
to
the
cable
act
because
of
cable's
unique
use
and
burden
upon
the
public
streets
and
rights-of-way.
what
does
a
franchise
get
an
smatv
facility
here,
your
honor?
a
franchise
does
not
give
them
the
right
to
speak
on
private
property.
all
that
a
franchise
does
is
give
them
the
right
to
install
facilities
in
public
streets
and
rights-of-way.
they
do
not
seek
to
install
facilities
in
public
streets
and
rights-of-way.
they
do
not
seek
governmental
benefits.
all
they
seek
to
do
is
install
facilities
on
private
streets
and
rights-of-way,
so
the
franchise
that
congress
has
dictated
that
these
facilities
must
obtain
does
not
even
give
them
the
right
which
they
seek,
which
is
to
speak
on
private
property.
what
gives
them
the
right
to
speak
on
private
property
is
the
private
property
owner.
now,
let's
say
the
franchise--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--but
when
you
franchise
those
businesses,
that
gives
them
the
right
to
enter
the
market.
when...
if
you...
when
you
franchise
an
smatv
operator
here,
that
alone
does
not
give
the
smatv
operator
the
right
to
enter
the
market.
the
smatv
operator--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--not
without
the
permission
of
the
private
property
owner.
that
is
an
additional
act
that
must
occur,
so
that
even
if
i
went
and
got
a
franchise
which
enabled
me
to
interconnect
separately
owned
and
managed
dwellings,
that
alone
would
not
give
me
the
right
to
enter
the
market.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
but
why--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--but
why
only
harm
the
competitive
entry
of
a
particular
interstate
media?
why
not
place
similar
franchising
entry
burdens
on
all
interstate
media
of
communications
similarly
situated?
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
well,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
is
some
objective
here
that
congress
sought
to
achieve
that
this
particular
regulatory
or
discriminatory
classification
actually
serves.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
typically,
in
practice,
a
local
franchise
grants
a
franchise
to
extend
cable
facilities
to
extend
cable
facilities
throughout
the
public
streets
and
rights-of-way
in
the
franchise
area,
which
is
usually
equivalent
to
the
individual
municipality,
the
boundaries
of
the
individual
municipality.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
exactly
not,
your
honor.
all
that
it
does
is
determine
that
on
an
overall
community
basis,
and
in
fact
the
danger
posed
here,
after
passage
of
the
'92
act,
congress
in
the
'92
act
tried
to
eliminate
or
correct
the
past
franchising
practices
of
municipalities,
which
were
to
grant
a
single
franchise
for
an
entire
municipality.
congress
realized,
or
at
least
found
in
the
cable
act
that
that
had
created
undue
market
power
for
particular
providers
of
these
services
in
the
marketplace.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
your
honor,
until
the
fcc's
decision
below...
the
fcc
after
passage
of
the
'84
act
had
determined
that...
had
interpreted
the
language
such
that
we
would
not
have
to
obtain
a
franchise.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
i'm
sorry,
your
honor--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--my
answer
is
no,
it
has
not,
and
may
i
offer
an
explanation?
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
in
the
'92
act,
which
is
what
i
was
about
to
explain--
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
--the
clients
in
front
of
this
court
have
these
particular
installations
throughout
the
united
states.
the...
pacific
cablevision,
for
example,
has
one
in
san
diego,
california.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
yes,
your
honor.
a
state
statute
in
california
says
to
pacific
cablevision
that
if
you
are
going
to
obtain
a
franchise
in
san
diego,
your
franchise
has
to
be
the
same
as
the
first
franchise,
which
would
mean
that
pacific
cablevision
would
have
to
provide
universal
service
throughout
the
entire
municipality.
ms.
deborah
c.
costlow
there
are...
with
respect
to
a
uniform
franchise
statute,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
there
are
about
nine
or
ten
of
those
in
various
states
throughout
the
country.
