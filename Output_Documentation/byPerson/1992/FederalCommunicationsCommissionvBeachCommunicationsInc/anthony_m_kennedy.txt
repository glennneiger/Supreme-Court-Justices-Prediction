are
they
generally
free
from
fcc
regulations,
as
well?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
are
other--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--requirements
that
these
cable
operators,
that
these
small
cable
operators
are
subject
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
position
that
it's
plausible
in
the
situation
put
by
justice
stevens
to
say
that
in
the
case
where
there's
single
ownership
there
is
more
leverage
and
therefore
the
market
is
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
mr.
manning,
if
you
prevail
on
this
argument,
and
in
this
case
it's
your
position
that
we
should
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
some
other
more
rigorous
standard
applies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
fcc
have
a
position
as
to
what
standard
applies
if
there
is
content
significance
to
the
regulations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
two
answers...
number
1,
it
would
be
preferable,
and
number
2,
you
don't
have
a
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
with
leverage
in
the
marketplace.
i
don't
see
how
that
fits
with
your
rationale
that
people
that
are
watching
the
television
have
diffused
control
where
there's
single
ownership.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
they
get
together
and
they
have
single
control,
isn't
that
precisely--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
goal
that
the
government
is
trying
to
reach?
