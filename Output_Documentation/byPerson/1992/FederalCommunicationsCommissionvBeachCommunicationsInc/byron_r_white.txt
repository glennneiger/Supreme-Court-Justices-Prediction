white
did
this
definition
just
date
from
'88,
1988?
justice
byron
r.
white
were
there
satellite
dishes
in
those
days?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
case
the
first
time
the
distinction
has
been
challenged
in
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
congress
has
revisited
this
area
several
times
since
'65,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
there
was
testimony
before
the
committees
opposing
this
distinction.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
commission
have
a
position
on
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
the
first
time
this
distinction
appears
you
said
was
in
1964.
justice
byron
r.
white
'65.
did
the
commission
have
a
position
then,
or
did
they
propose
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
counsel,
i
take
it
there's
just
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
as
to
what
congress
thought
the
justification
was
for
this
distinction.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
not
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
decision
was
also
irrational?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
just
think...
you
think
congress
was
just
thoughtless
when
they...
they
just
cribbed
this
out
of
a
commission
decision.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
think
that
at
some
point
since
1965
there
would
have
been
some
considerable
objections
to
this
discrimination.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
counsel
on
the
other
side
said
this
distinction
first
came
on
the
books
in
'65.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
when...
has
there
ever
been
objections
made
to
congress
in
their
hearings
since
'84,
because
they
certainly
have
been
back
in
this
area.
