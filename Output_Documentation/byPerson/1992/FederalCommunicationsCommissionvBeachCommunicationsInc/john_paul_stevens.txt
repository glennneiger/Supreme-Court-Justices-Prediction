mr.
manning,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the...
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
entirely
understand
your
rationale.
are
you
sort
of
assuming
that
one
of
these
singly
owned
complexes
is
a
separate
market?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
aren't
they...
aren't
there
a
lot
of
these
condominium
associations
in
a
big
city
like
washington,
or
new
york?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
they
each
negotiate
separately,
or
is
there
a
rate
that
generally
applies
to
all
of
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they're
just
part
of
a
market,
why
are
they
a
different
part
of
a
larger
market
if
10
buildings
are
owned
by
one
person
on
the
one
hand
and
they're
all
owned
by
10
separate
people
on
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it's
just
one
building,
i
guess
it
doesn't
matter,
because
if
it's
one
building
it
would
be
owned
by
one
person
or
one
association,
but
isn't
the
only...
doesn't
the
problem
only
arise
when
you've
got
a
complex
of
buildings
on
the
one
hand
owned
by
a
single
owner
and
on
the
other
hand
by
separate
owners?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
let's
assume
that
there
are
100
parallels
throughout
the
city.
50
of
them
are
singly
owned,
and
50
of
them
are
owned
by
the
10
separate
owners.
now,
you're
saying
that
if
you
don't
have
regulation,
they
would
all
get
different
rates.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
your
theory
is
that
this
is
what
congress
must
have
thought.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
units
that
are
economically
identical
would
receive
different
treatment
in
an
unregulated
market.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that's
sound?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
economic
support
for
that
hypothesis
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
are
no
brokers,
there
are
no
people
that
represent
owners
in
dealing
with
the
franchise
companies
in
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--or
have
any
scholarly
support
whatsoever
for
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
common-ownership
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
it
that
must
be
commonly
owned?
a
condominium,
for
example,
each
person
living
in
the
building
owns
his
or
her
own
apartment,
but
what
is
it
they
have
a...
just
the
satellite
dish,
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
if
a
group
of
neighbors
had
an
association
to
manage
their
satellite
dish,
with--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--common
ownership
of
the
satellite
dish?
that
would
not
count.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
to
perform
all
the
management
functions
that
the
management
of
the
condominium
association
performs
when
it's
handling
television
matters.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
common
ownership
of
the
television-related
facilities
would
not
be
sufficient.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
you
have
a
neighborhood
association
that
handles
the
collection
of
garbage
for
all
the
homes
on
the
block,
and
handles
some
private
security
force...
some
neighborhoods
have
that...
and
maybe
has...
and
then
decides
also
to
buy
a
satellite
dish.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
you
just
have
garbage,
security
protection,
protest
of
tax
bills,
and
management
of
the
satellite
dish?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
factual
question
just
to
help
me?
when
a
local
community
grants
the
franchise
that
you're
saying
they
should
not
have
the
right
to
grant,
do
they
grant
a
general
franchise
to
interconnect
all
the
units
in
the
city,
or
do
they
grant
them
on
particular
installation
by
installation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
isn't
a
case-by-case
determination
about
whether
the...
your
bargaining
power's
been
abused
in
a
particular
apartment
complex,
or
anything
like
that.
