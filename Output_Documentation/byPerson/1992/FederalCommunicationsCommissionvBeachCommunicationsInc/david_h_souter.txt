mr.
manning,
is
it
correct,
i
guess
almost
as
a
matter
of
definition,
that
on
the
scenario
you're
just
describing,
every
unit
of
buildings
is
going
to
have
to
have
its
own
complete
system?
i
mean,
there's
going
to
have
to
be
an
antenna,
and
so
on,
so
the...
what
i'm
getting
at
is
the
investment
is
going
to
be
much
greater
in
the
cases
subject
to
the
exception
and
the
cancellation
of
the
business
would
consequently
be
far
more
disastrous.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
simply
have
more
at
stake
in
keeping
them
happy.
justice
david
h.
souter
even
when
that
ruling
was
subject
to
appeal.
justice
david
h.
souter
on
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
have
gambled
on
us
getting
it
right?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
excuse
me,
the
government's
relying
on
a
leverage
rationale,
not
a
crude
size
rationale,
isn't
that
clear?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
resting
on
the
assumption
that
certain
systems
will
more
likely
be
small
and
other
systems
will
likely
be
larger,
but
the
rationale
ultimately
on
those
assumptions
is
based
on
leverage,
not
a
mere
crude
size
cut-off,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
may
be
so,
but
that's
a
different
argument.
i
mean,
that
is
not
an
argument
that
congress
expressly
rejected,
and
you
started
out
by
arguing
that
in
rejecting
the
size
rationale
it
had
rejected
the
government's
argument,
and
i'm
saying
it's
not
quite
that
clear.
