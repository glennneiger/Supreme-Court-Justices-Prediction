mr.
yurick,
the
city
here
is
trying
to
draw
a
distinction,
or
does
draw
a
distinction,
between
ordinary
newspapers
and
the
papers
that
were
desired
to
be
put
out
on
the
street
by
these
respondents,
and
yet
i
suppose
ordinary
newspapers
contain
a
lot
of
advertisements
as
well,
don't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
we
take
this
case
on
some
kind
of
concession
that
this
is
commercial
speech
at
issue
and
that
ordinary
newspapers
are
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
mr.
mezibov,
you
want
us
to
consider
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
your
clients
engage
only
in
commercial
speech,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
want
us
to
decide
it
on
the
basis
that
your
clients
engage
only
in
commercial
speech.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
or
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
want
us
to
assume,
do
you,
that
the
newspapers
that
the
city
allows
to
be
placed
in
newsracks
are
entitled
to
greater
protection
than
that
of
commercial
speech.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
does
the
city
ordinance
only
allow
the
sale
of
newspapers,
not
the
distribution
if
there's
no
sale?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
the
language
was
sale.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
the
ordinance
here
just
allowed
the
selling
of
newspapers
in
newsracks,
not
giving
them
away.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
nothing
else.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
can't
give
them
away.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
mezibov,
downstairs
in
the
public
areas
of
this
building
there's
a
little
section
set
aside
where
there
are
three
or
four
newsracks.
now,
is
it
your
position
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
this
court
to
refuse
to
provide
additional
newsracks
for
commercial
speech
such
as
your
clients
have
here,
or
can
we
limit
that
space
somehow
and
say,
we
have
a
very
small
space,
and
we
have
to
allocate
it
somehow
so
we're
going
to
allocate
it
only
to
fully
protected
speech?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
is
your
answer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
there
are
limited
resources,
what
is
your
answer...
limited
space?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
you
draw
the
line
on
the
basis
of
commercial
versus
noncommercial
speech--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
that
circumstance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
assuming
it's
viewpoint
neutral,
just
all
commercial
speech,
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
a
sense,
aren't
city
streets
a
finite
resource?
at
some
point
they're
too
cluttered,
or
they
interfere
with
traffic,
or
what-have-you.
can
the
city
make
that
kind
of
a
distinction
out
on
the
streets?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
content-neutral
criteria
is
all
commercial
speech.
we're
not
going
to
allow
it.
