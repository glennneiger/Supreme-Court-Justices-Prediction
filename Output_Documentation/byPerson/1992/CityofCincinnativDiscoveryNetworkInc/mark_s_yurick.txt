mr.
mark
s.
yurick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
the
respondents
and
other
commercial
speakers
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
place
newsrack-type
dispensing
devices
upon
the
public
sidewalks
of
the
city
of
cincinnati.
the
critical
inquiry
here
is
the
interpretation
of
the
fourth
prong
of
the
central
hudson
test,
which
requires
a
governmental
regulation
that
burdens
commercial
speech
to
burden
no
more
speech
than
is
necessary
to
further
the
government's
substantial
governmental
interest.
it
does
not
require
a
least
restrictive
means
test,
nor
does
the
test
require
the
regulation
to
completely
accomplish
the
goal.
in
other
words,
the
regulation
is
permitted
to
be
underinclusive.
the
fourth
prong
does
require
a
balancing
test.
however,
the
sixth
circuit
in
the
city's
opinion
balanced
the
wrong
things.
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
since
a
first
amendment
right
was
implicated,
that
was
to
be
balanced,
the
first
amendment,
against
the
degree
to
which
the
interest
was
served.
the
correct
balancing
test,
according
to
the
city,
is
the
state
interest
taken
as
a
whole
versus
the
incidental
burden
on
speech.
like
the
billboards
in
the
metromedia
case,
newsracks
are
large,
immobile,
and
semipermanent
structures,
although
they
do
have
a
communicative
function.
by
prohibiting
respondent's
newsrack
dispensing
devices,
cincinnati
has
done
no
more
than
attempt
to
eliminate
the
problems
posed
by
the
noncommunicative
presence
of
the
newsracks.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i
think
that
since
public
property
is
involved
the
city's
interest
in
preserving
that
public
property
for
all
of
the
citizens
of
cincinnati
is
perhaps
stronger,
and
i
believe
that
in
the
metromedia
case
the
prohibition
was
on
offsite
advertising,
both
public
and
private.
i
believe
that
the
exception
in
metromedia
was
for
onsite
advertising.
in
other
words,
the
owner
of
a
commercial
establishment
could
have
a
billboard
on
his
own
property
advertising
whatever
goods
were
for
sale
there.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
no,
your
honor,
but
that
is
precisely
what
discovery
network--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--and
harmon
homes
are
doing
here.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
agree
with
you
there,
and
i
think
that
the
point
is...
well,
it's
a
very
good
point.
[laughter]
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
parties
agreed
that
the
speech
in
question,
the
respondent's
publications,
do
constitute
commercial
speech.
there
was
testimony,
in
fact,
at
the
hearing
at
the
district
court
level
that
they
were
purely
advertising,
with
the
exception
of
harmon
homes
occasionally
including
an
article
about
interest
rates
or
something
of
that
nature
that
might
conceivably
be
considered
noncommercial
speech,
but
the
district
court
made
a
finding
there
that
the
speech
that
was
in...
even
the
speech
that
was
in
harmon
homes'
publication
was
not
inextricably
intertwined
with
the
commercial
speech.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
your
honor,
my
witness
said
that
the
same
problems
are
posed
by
boxes
that
contain
commercial
speech
and
boxes
that
contain
noncommercial
speech.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i'm
sorry,
i
think
the
distinctions
made
by
the
ordinances
themselves
are
merely
commercial
versus
noncommercial,
and
i
think
that
the
language
used
in
the
ordinances,
which
distinguish
between
commercial
and
noncommercial,
use
language
that's
been
approved
by
the
court.
there
was
a
memorandum--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--i
think
that
there
are
newspapers
which
are
specifically
allowed
to
be
distributed
from
newsracks
on
the
public
streets
of
cincinnati.
i
think
that
there
are
possibly
other
noncommercial
types
of
speech
which
could
be,
i
guess,
mixed
with
commercial
speech,
although
i'm
not
aware
of
any
that
have
applied
to
the
city
for
a
newsrack
permit.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is.
i
think
that
there
are
possibly
some
mixed
commercial
and
noncommercial
publications
that
don't
qualify
as
newspapers,
although
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
i
concede
that
there
may
be
publications
like
that.
i
think,
though,
that
to
the--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--that's
correct,
and
i
think
that
the
ordinance
also
allows
for
the
distribution
in
the
public
way
of
noncommercial
handbills
as
defined
in
the
code.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
noncommercial
handbills
are
specifically
in
the
exact
section
of
the
code.
it's
cited
again
in
the
briefs,
but
they
are
specifically
permitted
to
be
distributed.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
yes.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
newspapers--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--yes,
they
do,
and--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--that
would
be
correct,
not
on
the
public
streets
in
the
city.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
according
to
the
code,
no,
they
wouldn't.
however,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
your
honor
has
asked
me
an
overbreadth
question,
and--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
that
either
of
the
respondents
want
to
do
that,
and
there's...
there
are
also
various
alternative
means
for
the
respondents
to
communicate
their
commercial
message.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
that's
correct.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i
think
that
under
this--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--well,
i
don't
think
that
the
code
makes
any
sort
of
percentage,
or
has
any
sort
of
percentage
requirement,
and
i'm
not
certain
that
there
is...
there
should
be
any
percentage
requirement,
because
to
the
extent
that
even
a
small
proportion
of
noncommercial
speech
is
inextricably
intertwined
with
commercial
speech,
that
would
render
the
enter
publication
noncommercial
and
the
city
of
cincinnati
would
permit
that
publication
to
occupy
sidewalk
space.
however,
in
this
case,
as
i
said,
the
district
court
made
a
finding,
and
it
was
not
contested,
that
these
articles
that
were
in
the
harmon
homes
publication
were
not
inextricably
intertwined
with
the
commercial
message.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
your
honor,
the
district
court
didn't
make
a
finding
on
that
and
it
wasn't
really
an
issue
in
this
case
because
neither
of
the
respondents
claimed
that
they
published
newspapers.
i
don't
know
whether
an
argument
could
be
made--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--no,
they
don't.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
no.
no,
it
doesn't.
newspapers
of
general
circulation
are--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
the
district
court
made
a
finding
that
they
didn't
qualify--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
no,
it
won't,
your
honor,
and
your
honor,
might
i
say
the
ordinance
is,
or
it
could
be
considered
underinclusive
on
that
point.
i
don't
think
that
the
distinction
is
nonsensical
merely
because
the
city
of
cincinnati
is
only
trying
to
address
a
very
limited
portion
of
its
safety
and
aesthetic
problem.
i
don't
think
that
the
city
should
be
forced
to
address
or
incidentally
burden
even
a
larger
group
of
speech.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is
left
with
a
standardless
discretion.
again,
i
think
that
commercial,
noncommercial,
and
newspaper
standards
are
sufficient.
it's
not
a
case
like--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--there
was
a
memorandum
sent
from
the
city
manager,
who
is
the
chief
executive
officer--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--the
text
of
the
ordinance
doesn't
say
anything
about--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--it
was
in
a
memorandum
from
the
city
manager,
who
is
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
city,
to
the
city
engineer.
and
what
that
memo
stated,
paraphrasing,
is
that
from
this
point
forward,
in
terms
of
applying
regulation...
administrative
regulation
number
38,
which
is
an
administrative...
an
internal
administrative
direction
from
the
city
manager
to
the
departments
about
how
to
apply
the
ordinances
and
how
to
interpret
them,
that
in
interpreting
the
term,
or
in
interpreting
the
term,
newspapers
of
general
regulation,
for
purposes
just
of
allowing
a
box
on
the
sidewalk,
which
is
what
administrative
regulation
38
deals
with,
that
newspaper
of
general
circulation
should
be
interpreted
as
relating
to
publications
which
predominantly
cover
current
events
or
political
affairs,
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i
think
what
the
city
engineer,
tom
young,
testified
to
was
that
that
would
present
a
very
close
case.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i
don't
think
that
there...
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i
don't
think
there
is
any
testimony.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i
don't
think--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--i
don't...
i
don't
think
there's
any
testimony
to
that
in
the
record,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i
think
the
testimony
related
to,
again,
respondent's
particular
publications
which
were
admittedly
not
newspapers.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
yes.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
yes,
there
are.
i'm
sorry--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--yes,
your
honor,
newspapers
of
general
circulation
are
expressly
permitted,
and
again,
i
guess
i
would
have
to
say
whether
they--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--no.
no,
and
again
i
would
have
to
say
that
the
50-50
distinction
was
said
by
the
city
engineer
to
present
a
closed
case.
i'm
not,
i
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
if
a
particular
newspaper
only
had
30
percent
noncommercial
speech
in
it
and
70
percent
commercial
speech
that
they
would
not
be
permitted
to
occupy
space
on
the
city
sidewalks.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
think
that
your
honor's
question
points
out
that
perhaps
there
should
be
no
exact
percentage.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
a
newspaper
i
think
is
not
such
a
vague
term
that
it
can't
be
understood,
or
that
the
use
of
the
word
newspaper
of
general
circulation
in
the
statutory
scheme
can't
be
understood
by
a
reasonable
person.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
the
hearing
in
the
case
at
the
district
court,
the
respondents
were
both
asked,
did
the
publications
constitute
newspapers,
and
they
were
both
able
to
answer
the
question
rather
quickly.
i
don't
think
it's
such
a
vague
term
that
it
gives
the
city
unbridled
discretion.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
there
is
no
specific
mention
of
the
devices
in
the
city
ordinances.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
however,
in
the
administration
regulation--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--the
city
manager--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--who
is
the
chief
executive
officer.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
no,
just
the
administrative
regulation.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
yes,
they
do
have
to
apply
for
a
permit.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
that's
pursuant
to
the
administrative
regulation.
there's
no
ordinance
that
grants
them
the
right
to
a
permit.
that's
all
in
the
administrative
regulation.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
it's
newspapers
of
general
circulation
in
the
ordinances,
specifically
or
excepted
from
the
prohibition.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
no,
your
honor,
the
administrative...
through
the
administrative
regulation
they
have
been
afforded
the
privilege
of
placing
these
boxes
on
the
city
sidewalks.
i'm...
the
only
case
that
i'm
aware
of
on
this
subject,
this
court's
prior,
left
the
question
specifically
open.
that
was
the
lakewood
v.
plain
dealer
case.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
if
the
administrative
regulation
were
to
be
repealed
and--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--there's
no
reason
whether
the
ordinance--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--the
city
manager.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
it
may
just
say
newspaper.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
in
this
case,
the
regulatory
scheme
as
applied,
and
by
prohibiting
respondent's
newsrack
devices,
does
no
more
than
attempt
to
eliminate
the
problems
posed
by
the
noncommunicative
presence
of
the
boxes.
the
entire
burden,
again,
is
limited
to
the
elimination
of
newsracks,
and
no
portion
of
the
incidental
burden
on
the
speech
fails
to
serve
the
city's
substantial
governmental
interest
in
eliminating
the
safety
and
aesthetics
problems
posed
by
the
newsracks.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
well,
it's
certainly
not
unimportant,
your
honor.
that's
not
the
city's
contention.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
the
city's
contention
is--
[laughter]
certainly
not,
your
honor...
that
noncommercial
speech
throughout
the
precedence
of
this
court's
prior
cases
has
been
afforded
a
lesser
degree
of
first
amendment
protection.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
but
again,
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that
we
didn't
make
a
distinction
between
commercial
versus
noncommercial
speech...
in
other
words,
do
what
the
sixth
circuit
said
and
just
provide
for
a
limit
to
the
number
of
total
boxes
and
apply
the
scheme
on
a
first-come-first-served
basis...
that
to
the
extent
that
there
was
one
slot,
one
box
space
open
and
both...
we
had
an
application
from
both
a
commercial
speaker
and
a
noncommercial
speaker,
to
the
extent
that
we
were
to
allocate
that
public
space
to
a
commercial
publication
to
the
exclusion
of
a
noncommercial
publication,
we
would
probably
be
in
violation
of
the
metromedia
case
which
says
that
a
regulatory
scheme
which
makes
a
distinction
between
commercial
versus
noncommercial
speech
cannot
give
a
preference
to
commercial
speech
over
noncommercial
speech.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
whether
it's
a
specific
preference
in
the
ordinance
or
a
preference
that
simply
occurs
as
a
result
of
an
inadequate
scheme,
i'm
not
certain
that
that
makes
a
difference.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i
don't
think
that
making...
again--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
yes,
we
can.
among
noncommercial
speakers--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--i
think
that
we
could.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i
believe
that's
correct.
again,
metromedia--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
to
the
extent
that,
again,
the
ordinance
or
statutory
scheme
that
the
city
would
promulgate
would
allow
a
commercial
speaker
to
have
a
space
while
forbidding
a
noncommercial
speaker
to
have
that
access,
that
it
would
be
a
violation
of
metromedia.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
we
should
be
able
to
regulate
these
structures
in
the
public
way.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i
would
say
the
difference
in
the
degree
of
deference
due
a
local
government
in
regulating
commercial
versus
noncommercial--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--the
distinction
has
to
be
made
on
content,
but
i
don't--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--well,
again,
i
guess
to
the
extent
that
the
legislature
has
a
greater
degree
of
latitude
in
regulating
commercial
speech
as
opposed
to
regulating
noncommercial
speech,
my
answer
to
the
question
would
be
that
it's
not
necessarily
that
that
ought
to
be
the
decision
that
the
legislature
makes,
but
it
is
one
that
it
can
make
under
this
court's
prior
precedents.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
no,
they
don't,
your
honor,
they
are
distributed
free.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i
think
that
the
city
could
conclude
that,
your
honor.
i
think
there
might
be
danger
in
the
city
regulating
on
that
basis,
because
the
third
prong
of
the
central
hudson
test
which
has
been
satisfied
here...
and
i
think
both
courts
have
found
that
this
ordinance
directly
affects
the
city's
substantial
governmental
interest...
an
argument
could
be
made
that
as
in
schneider
v.
the
state,
this
court
has
said
that
banning
hand-billing
because
the
handbills
might
be
used
as
litter
wasn't
a...
there
wasn't
a
direct
enough
nexus.
i
don't
think
there's
that
problem
here.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
no,
your
honor,
and
again,
in
this
case
i
think
that
the
interests
posed
were
the
interests
in
the
safety
and
aesthetics
of
the
sidewalks,
and
i
think
there
was
testimony
that
these
boxes
detracted
from
the
safety
and
aesthetic
interest
of
the
sidewalks,
and
that
is
exactly
what
is
being
banned.
again,
both
discovery
network
and
harmon
homes
have
alternative
means
of
distributing
their
communications.
in
harmon
homes'
case,
85
percent
of
their
publications
are
distributed
through
other
means,
and
in
discovery
network's
case,
66
percent
are
distributed
through
other
means.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
i'm
not
really
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
that
might
be
so,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
that
it's
in
the
record.
again,
this
was
treated
more
as
an
as-applied
challenge
than
a
facial
or
an
overbreadth
challenge,
so--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--i
don't
think
that
it's
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
i
think
that
it
was
drafted
probably
closely
after
the
christensen...
valentine
v.
christensen
case--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--because
the
language
in
that
statute
closely
resembles
that
in
the
christensen
case.
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
that's
correct--
mr.
mark
s.
yurick
--but
i
don't
necessarily
think
that
that
makes
the
ordinance
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
