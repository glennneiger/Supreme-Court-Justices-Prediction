justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
city's
latitude
that
you
contend
for,
it's
latitude
in
regulating
commercial
speech,
permit
it
to
regulate
substantially
more
commercial
speech
than
is
necessary
to
accomplish
its
interest?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
ordinance
forbade
newsracks
that
dispensed
the
material
for
free
and
permitted
only
those
that
are
coin-operated.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
it
were
shown
that
in
the
case
of
coin-operated
racks
they
did
not
have
many
of
the
evils
that
free
ones
do...
they
were
not
receptacles
for
garbage,
they
were
better
maintained.
if
the
city
had
that
factual
background,
could
it
then
enact
the
ordinance
that
i
suppose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
minimum
were
a
quarter...
25
cents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
content
neutral
means
no
distinction
between
commercial
and
noncommercial.
