justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
newspapers,
i'm
talking
about
the
other
sides
to
the
publications.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
that
they
may
not
only
not
use
these
stationary
devices,
but
they
can't
be
distributed
at
all
on
the
streets?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
can't
be
handed
out
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
asked
you
a
factual
question,
whether,
under
the
ordinance,
as
i
understand
it,
your
opponent's
publications
could
not
be
either
distributed
through
the
stationary
boxes
or
by
having
people
hand
them
out
to
passers-by.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other
basic
question?
as
i
read
the
ordinances
in
the
district
court's
opinion,
or
the
findings,
they
don't
say
anything
about
these
devices.
they
talk
about
distribution
of
handbills
and
newspapers.
is
there
any
mention
of
the
vending
devices
in
any
city
ordinance?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
however--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
all
the
law
out
of
this
is
an
administration
regulation
by
the
city
engineer
or
city
manager,
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
ordinances
themselves
don't
even
tell
us
anything
about
these
devices
or
the
number
that
might
be
appropriate,
or
anything
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
it
would
be
consistent
with
the
ordinances
for
the
city
manager
to
say
we're
just
not
going
to
have
these
boxes
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--who
promulgates
the
administrative
regulations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
city
manager
could
change
his
regulation
and
say
we're
not
going
to
use
any
boxes,
or
he
could
also
say
we're
going
to
allow
500
boxes,
and
that's
going
to
be
enough,
and
he
could
also
say
they'll
all
be
painted
red,
or
they'll
all
be
painted
green.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
your
section
701(c),
the
ordinance
that
prohibits
handbilling
on
the
public
streets
entirely,
has
that
been
in
effect
since
a
long,
long
time
ago.
it
seems
to
be
almost
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
justice
john
paul
stevens
long
before
the
court
had
held
that
commercial
speech
had
any
protection
under
the
first
amendment
this
ordinance
was
drafted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
they
have
a
separate
ordinance...
911-17...
that
expressly
allows
the
distribution
of
newspapers,
and
it
was
enacted
later,
so
it's
in
the
nature
of...
notwithstanding
the
definition
of
handbill,
a
newspaper
can
be
distributed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
does
fall
within
that
definition--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--without
any
doubt--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
mean,
that's
true.
wouldn't
you
read
the
later
ordinance
as
saying,
but
we
are
not
applying
this
handbill
prohibition
to
newspapers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
is
some
merit
to
the
notion
that
we
have
some
idea
that
what
are
on
these
boxes
are
probably
newspapers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
your
paper
could
also
qualify
as
a
newspaper,
but
you
don't
make
that
contention.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
what
about
the
reason
the
chief
justice
suggested,
that
if
it's
given
away
free
it's
more
apt
to
be
tossed
on
the
sidewalk
than
if
you
have
to
pay
for
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
it
isn't
a
sufficient
reason,
but
at
least
it
would
be
a
reason,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
understand
that.
we're
off
in
the
realm
of
hypotheticals
here
today.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
none
of
this
has
anything
to
do
with
this
case,
really.
[laughter]
it's
just
fun.
yes.
do
you
understand
my
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
would
agree
that
at
least
is
a
reason.
if
you
said
25
cents
or
more,
it's
less
apt
to
be
litter
than
if
it's
free
stuff.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
and
there's
no
record
here
to
show
there's
a--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
never
approach
the
scarcity
limit
that
they
seem
to
me
would
have
to
have
to
justify
what
they're
doing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
nobody
will
pick
it
up
just
out
of
curiosity
and
say
i
wonder
what
this
is.
people
do
that
with
free
things
in
all
sorts
of
places.
they
pick
it
up,
look
at
it,
and
see
if
they're
not
interested.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
25
cents
a
box
you'll
let
all
the
newspapers
on
the
stand,
they
won't
let
your
publications
on.
you
wouldn't
want
this
if
you
had
to...
if
people
had
to
pay
25
cents
for
your
publication.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
a
25
percent
charge
would
have
the
exact
same
effect
as
this
ordinance
has--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
last
question?
your
opponents
have
given
us
amended
regulation
38
at
the
end
of
their
brief,
which
i
guess
is
something
that
came
later,
signed
by
sylvester
murray.
is
he
the
city
manager?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
something
in
the
record
that
defines
the
scope
of
the
authority
of
a
city
manager?
do
we
know
what...
is
he
kind
of
like
a
czar
who
can
do
anything
he
wants
to--
[laughter]
or
is
there
some
limitation
on
his
power?
justice

stevens
respondent,

recreational,
and
social

area.

consisting
primarily
of
promotional

pertaining
to
its
courses.
respondent
harmon
publishing
company
publishes
and
distributes
a
free
magazine
that
advertises
real
estate
for
sale
in
the
greater
cincinnati
area.
in
1989,
the
city
of
cincinnati
granted
respondents
permission
to
place
62
free
standing
newsracks
at
various
locations
throughout
the
city
to
be
used
to
distribute
their
magazines.
about
a
year
later,
however,
the
city
reversed
its
course
motivated
by
its
interest
in
the
safety
and
attractive
appearance
of
its
streets
and
sidewalks,
the
city
revoke
respondent's
permits.
the
city
relied
on
a
preexisting
ordinance
that
barred
the
distribution
of
commercial
handbills
on
a
public
property.
it
made
no
effort,
however,
to
limit
the
almost
2000
newsracks
on
cincinnati
sidewalks
that
are
used
to
distribute
newspapers.
respondents
brought
this
action
in
federal
district
court
claiming
that
the
city's
actions
were
inconsistent
with
the
first
amendment.
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
agreed
holding
that
the
city's
categorically
ban
on
the
distribution
of
"commercial
handbills"
by
a
newsrack
violated
the
reasonable
fit
standard
applicable
to
regulations
of
commercial
speech
that
we
have
recently
articulated
in
board
of
trustees
of
the
state
and
university
of
new
york
against
fox.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
this
court,
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
the
city's
outdated
ordinance
barring
the
distribution
of
commercial
handbills,
was
enacted
long
before
any
concern
about
newsracks
developed,
where
the
apparent
purpose
of
preventing
the
kind
of
visual
blight
caused
by
littering
rather
than
any
harm
associated
with
permanent
freestanding
dispensing
devices.
the
fact
that
the
city
failed
to
address
its
recently
developed
concerned
about
newsracks
by
regulating
their
size,
their
shape,
their
appearance
or
number
indicates
that
the
city
has
not
carefully
calculated
the
costs
and
benefits
associated
with
its
regulation
as
required
by
our
decision
in
fox.
we
agree
with
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
benefit
to
be
derived
from
the
removal
of
62
newsracks
while
almost
2000
remain
in
placed
is
miniscule.
we
reject
the
city's
argument
that
because
every
decrease
in
the
overall
number
of
newsracks
necessarily
affects
an
increase
in
safety
and
esthetics,
the
validity
of
its
ban
on
newsracks
distributing
commercial
handbills
is
not
undermined
by
its
failure
to
similarly
restrict
newsracks
distributing
newspapers.
the
city's
argument
is
based
on
the
premise
that
commercial
speech
has
only
a
low
value
and
therefore
commercial
speech
can
always
be
subject
to
discriminatory
treatment.
in
our
view,
however,
the
city
attaches
more
importance
to
the
distinction
between
commercial
and
non
commercial
speech
than
our
cases
warrant
and
seriously
underestimates
the
value
of
commercial
speech.
in
the
absence
of
some
basis
for
distinguishing
between
newspapers
and
commercial
handbills
that
is
relevant
to
the
city's
asserted
intereset
in
safety
in
esthetics
we
are
unwilling
to
recognize
cincinnati's
bare
assertion
that
the
low
value
of
commercial
speech
a
sufficient
justification
for
its
selective
and
categorically
ban
on
newsracks
dispensing
commercial
handbills.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
the
concurring
opinion;
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
white
and
justice
thomas
have
joined.
