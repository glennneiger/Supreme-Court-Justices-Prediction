aren't
there
other
ordinances
that
expressly
permit
the
distribution
of
newspapers
on
a
public
right-of-way?
justice
byron
r.
white
911-17
and
862-1.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn't
the
newspaper
or
anybody
else
that
wants
to
put
one
of
these
have
to
get
a
permit?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that's
just
by
regulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
take
it
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
ordinances,
or
would
it,
for
the
city
to
deny
the
right
to
newspapers
to
distribute
the
newspapers
through
these
boxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
doesn't
say
that
the
ordinances
doesn't
protect
the
right
of
a
newspaper
to
put...
to
distribute
through
these
boxes
by
occupying
public
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what...
you...
the
city
seems
to
say
that
commercial
speech
does
not
enjoy
the
same
protection
as
noncommercial
speech
does
under
the
first
amendment--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
therefore
you
should
be
able
to
ban
these
boxes.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
thought
you...
i
thought
the
lesser
protection
given
to
commercial
speech
was
based
on
its
content,
don't
you
agree?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
my
question
is,
what
do
you
think
justifies
giving
commercial
speech
less
protection
than
noncommercial
speech?
isn't
it
its
content?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
what
has
that
distinction
got
to
do
with
cluttering
up
the
streets,
whether
commercial
distributors
should
have
less
opportunity
to
distribute
on
the
streets?
justice
byron
r.
white
--this
wasn't
really
the
basis
for
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
was
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals
rationale?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
defend
the
way
they
arrived
at
the
result?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
they
were
quite
right
in
identifying
the
kind
of
a
balance
that
they
thought
they
should
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes
or
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
dispute
in
the
courts
below
that
your
publication
was
commercial
speech?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that
issue
in
this
case
is
just
not
open.
you
didn't
carry
it
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
your
publication
contain
an
offer
of
sale?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
suppose
at
least
the
first
publication
you
describe
really
fits
the
definition
of
commercial
speech.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn't
one
of
the
ordinances
give
the
city
manager
some...
and
provided
further
that
newspapers
of
general
circulation
in
the
city
of
cincinnati
be
sold
from
racks,
containers
and
bags,
attached
to
poles,
a-da-da,
in
accordance
with
rules
and
regulations
promulgated
by
the
city
manager.
