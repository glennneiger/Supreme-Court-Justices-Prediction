chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-1200,
city
of
cincinnati
v.
discovery
network,
inc.--
mr.
yurick,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
yurick,
you
suggest
an
analogy
to
the
metromedia
case,
but
isn't
the
city's
position
here
perhaps
stronger,
because
metromedia
was
a
regulation
of
billboards
on
private
property?
here,
the
newspapers
or
the
distributors
are
simply
taking
over
public
property,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
no
one
was
claiming
a
right
to
put
a
billboard
on
property
owned
by
the
state
there,
were
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
why
i
suggest--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--your
case
may
be
stronger
than
those
of
the
billboard
people,
metromedia.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
latitude--
--do
the
respondents
charge
for
their
brochures
or
flyers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
the
city
might
conclude
that
something
that
you
get
for
free
you're
more
likely
to
throw
away
on
your
way
home
than
something
you
paid
for
like
a
newspaper.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
of
course
that
wouldn't
but--
--thank
you,
mr.
yurick.
mr.
mezibov,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
kind
of
withdraws
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
in
a
way,
doesn't
it,
because
we
have
held
that
in...
i
think
in
the
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
case,
didn't
we,
that
the
fact
that
there
was...
the
libel
might
arise
out
of
an
advertisement
did
not
make
it
just
commercial
speech.
at
least
it
was
entitled
to
full
first
amendment
protection.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
this
ordinance,
mr.
mezibov,
you're
referring
to,
what,
section
714-23--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
any
other
parts...
the
definitional
section
714-1-c--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
city
could
distinguish
between
newspapers
of
general
circulation,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
on
the
one
hand,
and
commercial
handbills
on
the
other
as
to
distribution
if
it
precisely
defined
each
category
so
that
the
city
manager
would
not
be
chargeable
with
any
unbridled
discretion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say,
then,
the
city
could
not,
even
with
proper
and
careful
definitions,
distinguish
between
newspapers
and
commercial
flyers
with
respect
to
distribution
by
newsracks.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
it
passed
an
ordinance
that
did
that,
do
you
think
it
should
be
upheld?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
city
were
to
provide
in
an
ordinance
that
the
only
way
you
can
put
a
newsrack...
anybody,
newspaper,
flyer,
or
anything
else,
on
a
city
street
is
to
lease
the
space
from
the
city,
since
it
owns
the
space?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
lots
of
laws
do
present
financial
problems
to
people
in
business.
would
this
law
be
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
right
to
just
take
over
public
property?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
the
city
just
repeals
all
its
present
ordinances
and
says,
you
know,
they've
got
us
into
a
lot
of
litigation,
one
case
went
all
the
way
to
the
supreme
court,
we're
just
going
to
have
a
flat
regulation
that
first-come,
first-served,
anybody
who
wants
to
put
a
newsrack
on
public
property
can
do
so,
so
long
as
they
pay
the
fair
value
of
the
lease
for
the
period
of
time
they're
occupying
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
public
forum
doctrine
require
the
city
to
let
private
people
appropriate
public
property
indefinitely?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
very
likely
because
the
cities
know
that
people
want
to
buy,
have
newsracks
available,
but
i
don't
think
that
answers
the
question
of
whether
the
cities
might
charge
the
fair
value
of
a
year-to-year
lease
for
that
small
bit
of
property.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
city
has
a
large
auditorium
that
it
makes
available
to
private
groups
and
you
have
to
lease
the
auditorium.
you
have
to
pay
for
the
janitorial
service,
the
lights,
and
so
forth,
and
one
group
says,
well,
we
want
to
use
this
auditorium,
but
we
just
can't
afford
that
price,
even
though
we
concede
it's
fair
value.
do
you
think
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
use
that
auditorium?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mezibov.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-1200,
cincinnati
versus
discovery
network
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
