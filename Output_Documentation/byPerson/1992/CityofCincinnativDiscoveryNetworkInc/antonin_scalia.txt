mr.
yurick,
i
understand
that
the
real
estate
brochure
involved
here
sometimes
contained
matter
other
than
the
mere
listing
of
homes.
i
mean,
it
might
comment
on
whether
the
market
is
soft
or
hard
or
what
interest
rates
are,
things
of
that
sort.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
but
that
isn't
enough
to
make
it
qualify
as
a
newspaper?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
ads
do
you
have
to
have
to
be
not
a
newspaper
anymore?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
under...
they
were
not
inextricably
intertwined.
you
mean,
they
could
have
been
separated
from
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
opposed
to
the
advertising
in
newspapers,
which
is
inextricably
intertwined?
justice
antonin
scalia
never
mind
the
argument,
does
the
city
apply
that
test
to
newspapers--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
only
advertising...
if
the
advertising
can
be
separated...
no,
it
doesn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
they
put
all
their
advertising
in
one
section
at
the
end,
you
know,
advertising
section,
and
all
the
rest
is
news,
it
would
still
qualify,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
real
estate
brochure
was
not
allowed
to
qualify
on
that
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
support...
and
the
city
supports
that
finding,
correct?
i
mean,
the
city
says
that
it
will
exclude
this
magazine
because
although
it
contains
nonadvertising
matter,
that
advertising
matter
is...
could
be
separated,
and
that's
the
reason
the
city
will
exclude
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
won't
exclude
newspapers
on
that
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
measure
this
by
words
or
by
area,
the
30
percent/50
percent?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
said
several
times
newspapers
of
general
circulation.
i
don't
find
the
phrase,
of
general
circulation,
in...
maybe
i
don't
know
where
it
is,
but
i
don't
find
it
in
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
code.
it
may
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
that's
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
yurick,
why
do
you
pick
on
commercial
speech?
i'm
thinking
back...
of
the
important
decisions
i've
made
in
my
life,
certainly
buying
a
house
is
enormously
important.
i
mean,
much
more
important
to
me
than
the
latest
state
of
the
war
in
bosnia,
and
your
city
manager
makes
the
decision
that
people
must
be
allowed
to
find
out
the
latest
news
from
bosnia
but
cannot
be
given
from
these
same
boxes
information
on
the
choices
they
have
in
buying
a
house.
why
is
that
speech
so
unimportant
that
it
can
be
suppressed
this
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
what
else
is
the
matter
with
it?
is
it
obscene?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
purposes
that
had
something
to
do
with
the
distinctive
nature
of
commercial
speech,
but
commercial
speech
doesn't
clutter
up
your
sidewalks
anymore
than
noncommercial
speech
does,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we're
not
talking
about
giving
a
preference,
we're
just
talking
about
equal
treatment.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
you
have
too
many
noncommercial
publications
to
fill
up
your
news
boxes?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
you
have
to
allow
as
many
noncommercial--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
you
have
a
first-come-first
served?
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
among
noncommercial,
but
not
among
commercial.
justice
antonin
scalia
bosnia
wins
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
local
newspaper?
what
percentage
of
theirs
are
distributed
by
home
delivery?
justice
antonin
scalia
probably
very
high,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
in
that
respect
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
newspapers
are
any
different
from
the
commercial
publications.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
apparently
only
in
the
morning
or
afternoon,
not
in
the
evening.
you
don't
have
an
evening
newspaper
in
cincinnati.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
very
beautifully
drafted
ordinance.
[laughter]
either
in
the
morning
or
afternoon
where
permission
has
been
obtained.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mezibov,
i
guess
i
don't
understand
your
position,
then.
i
had
thought
from
your
briefs
that
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
would
have
been
that
you
do
not
acknowledge...
you
do
not
acknowledge
that
commercial
speech
is
not
fully
protected
speech
in
the
same
sense
that
all
speech
is...
i
mean,
in
one
sense
no
speech
is
fully
protected
speech,
because
it
can't
be
given
everywhere.
there
are
restrictions
that
can
be
placed
as
to
time,
place,
and
manner.
i
thought
that's
what
your
brief
said,
that
commercial
speech
is
speech,
and
it's
entitled
to
constitutional
protections.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can
be
limited
more
than
other
speech
only
because
of
particular
dangers
that
commercial
speech
may
have
and
with
respect
to
those
particular
dangers,
but
when
those
particular
dangers
are
not
present,
it
has
to
be
treated
like
other
speech.
i
thought
that's
what
your
brief
said,
but
it's
certainly
not
what
your
answer
says.
your
answer
says
now
that
in
our
building
here
we
can
say
no
commercial
speech,
just
noncommercial
speech.
we
can
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
how
much
space
we
have
for
racks,
you
now
tell
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
your
whole
case
was
that
limitation
of
resources
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
distinction
between
commercial
and
noncommercial.
fraud
does,
prior
permission
perhaps
does,
but
certainly
not
space.
commercial
and
noncommercial
take
up
just
as
much
space.
isn't
your
answer
totally
inconsistent
with
what
you
said
in
your
brief?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand.
mr.
mezibov,
i
would
have
thought
your
answer
to
that
question
would
have
been
that
whether
you
charge
for
it
or
not
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
it's
commercial
speech.
newspapers
are
not
commercial
speech
and
they
are
generally
charged
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
some
types
of
purely
advertising
brochures,
i
think
there
are
real
estate
things
or
automobile
things
that
you
pay
money
for
even
though
it's
all
advertising.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
no
problem
with
charging...
with
a
law
that
says
you
have
to
charge
for
it,
do
you?
no
boxes
unless
you
pay
for
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
while
you
acknowledge
that
you
do
not
have
presented
before
us
whether
you
are
commercial
speech,
you
also
claim,
however,
that
you
are
free
to
argue
here
that
newspapers
are
as
much
commercial
speech
as
you
are.
