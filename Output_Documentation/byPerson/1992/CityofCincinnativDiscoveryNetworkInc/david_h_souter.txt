justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
point
of
fact,
you're
not
making
a
commercial...
or
your
ordinance
doesn't
make
a
commercial-noncommercial
speech
distinction,
does
it?
that's
not
what
it
turns
on.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be,
but
that
is
not
the
way
you
have
drafted
your
ordinance.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
your...
as
i
understand
it,
your
ordinance
turns
on
the
predominant
dedication
of
the
so-called
newspapers
to
the
dissemination
of
what,
news
of
current
events,
i
guess
is
the
way
it's
described,
isn't
it,
and
yet
everything
which
is
excluded
by
that
is
not
necessarily
commercial
speech,
isn't
that
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
case,
you
take
the
position
that
the
definition
of
what
we
are
for
shorthand
purposes
calling
newspapers
is
in
fact
a
definition
which
divides
the
world
into
two
categories,
newspapers
and
noncommercial
speech,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
are
taking
the...
if
i
understand
you,
you
are
taking
the
position
that
if
it
does
not
qualify
as
a
newspaper,
and
hence
does
not
qualify
for
the
right
to
be
displayed
and
sold
from
these
boxes,
it
is...
the
publication
is
noncommercial
speech
within
the
meaning
of
our
cases,
is
that
correct?
is
that
the
way
you
are
reading
your
ordinance?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
there
would
be
some
nonmixed
publications
which
are
not
newspapers
but
which
are
just
as
clearly
not
commercial
speech,
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
does
it
do
that?
maybe
i'm
just
forgetting
what
i
should
have
read
better.
how
does
the
ordinance
provide
for
those
noncommercial
but
nonnewspaper
distributions?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
are
expressly
exempted
from
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--from
the
ban.
okay.
may
i
ask,
while
you're
being
interrupted,
commercial
hand...
do
these
newspapers
here
come
within
the
definition
of
commercial
handbills
within
the
ordinance?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
assuming
that
to
be
true,
isn't
your
real
problem
here
as
you're
describing
it
not
that
the
audience
is
perhaps
underinclusive
but
that
the
ordinance
is
inarticulate,
and
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
the
city
might
decide
to
do
next
either
in
drawing
the
kind
of
distinction
that
justice...
or
applying
the
kind
of
distinction
that
justice
scalia
was
discussing
to
what
we
would
call
regular
newspapers,
or
in
deciding
what
the
percentage
mix
between
advertising
and
news
ought
to
be.
in
point
of
fact,
the
city
is
left
under
the
ordinance
with
a
standardless
discretion,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
just
get
down
to
the
definition
of
what
we're
calling
newspapers.
i
don't
have
the
text
of
the
ordinance
in
front
of
me.
doesn't
it
refer
to
what
we're
calling
newspapers
as
something
which
is
predominantly
or
primarily
devoted
to
the
dissemination
of
news
of
current
events?
is
that
the
scheme?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
first,
how
about
just
the
text?
help
me
out
on
the
text.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
says
nothing
whatsoever.
so
the
language
that
i
was
thinking
of
was
in
this
memorandum.
justice
david
h.
souter
did
he
later
testify
that,
roughly
speaking,
he
would
suppose
that
predominantly
applied...
predominantly
implied
that
there
would
be
something
better
than
50
percent
of
the
space
devoted
to
the
current
events?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
in...
and
in
point
of
fact
i
gather
it's
in
the
record
that
most
newspapers
are
70
percent
advertising.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
was
no
testimony
to
that
effect?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
just
put
that
in
the
brief.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
so
in
any
case,
you
stand
on
the
fact
that
the
city's
construction
of
its
ordinance
involves
the
word
predominantly,
and
predominantly
would
call
for
a
publication
with
50
percent
news
as
opposed
to
50
percent
advertising,
and
that's
the
way
the
ordinance
is
going
to
be
interpreted
and
applied,
is
that
the
position
that
you
rest
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
they
have
definitions
of
what
is
a
newspaper
of
general
circulation?
justice
david
h.
souter
with
respect
to
space
or
aesthetics,
there
is
no
such
reason,
isn't
that
your
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
your
strongest
argument
on
the
lack
of
content
neutrality
that
when
you
make
a
distinction
between
commercial
and
noncommercial
which
is
not
for
the
purposes
for
which
the
commercial
speech
regulation
has
been
accepted
by
this
court,
that
that
is
by
definition
a
content-based
distinction?
i
mean,
you
don't
have
to
go
any
further
than
that,
do
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
whereas
if
the
city
were
regulating
fraud
in
commercial
speech,
it
would
not
be
invalid
simply
because...
as
content-based.
