mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
city
of
cincinnati
seeks
to
enforce
against
harmon
and
discovery's
publications
an
outright
ban
on
the
distribution
in
public
areas
of
important
and
valuable
information
concerning
economic
and
educational
opportunities
as
part
of
a
regulatory
scheme
which
on
its
face
allows
city
officials
to
make
unprincipled
and
standardless
decisions
about
what
kinds
of
speech
and
what
speakers
can
be
on
the
public
areas.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
justice
o'connor,
we
did
not
take
up
the
matter
of
whether
we
are
or
are
not
commercial
speakers.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
your
honor,
we
feel
that
this
case
can
be
decided--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--as
if
we
are
commercial
speakers--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--just
as
the
lower
courts
have
determined--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--in
accordance
with
the
central
hudson
criteria.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
certainly
not
in
these
circumstances.
your
honor,
we
did
not
concede
that
we
are
commercial
speakers,
and
although
we
have
not
appealed
that
issue,
we
have
never
conceded
that
newspapers
are
not
also
commercial
speakers
within
the
city's
own
dictionary.
they
are,
by
definition,
as
much
commercial
speakers
as
we
are.
the
city's
scheme
is
quite
confused
on
that
point.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
well,
the
city
has
drafted
a
scheme
of
ordinances
which
includes
in
it
definitions
of
commercial
speech...
commercial
handbills,
that
is...
and
a
definition
of
noncommercial
handbills.
there
is
no
definition
whatsoever
of
what
constitutes
a
newspaper.
on
the
one
hand,
newspapers
are
expressly
permitted
on
the
city
streets
by
reason
of
911-17.
on
the
other
hand,
the
city
expressly
prohibits
the
distribution
of
commercial
handbills
in
all
public
areas.
according
to
the
city's
own
scheme
of
regulating
commercial
handbills,
a
commercial
handbill
is
any
printed
matter
which
advertises
for
sale
any
merchandise,
product,
commodity
or
thing,
or
which
directs
attention
to
any
business
or
mercantile
or
commercial
establishment
or
other
activity
for
the
purpose
of
directly
promoting
the
interest
thereof
by
sales,
or
which
directs
attention
to
or
advertises
any
meeting,
theatrical
performance,
exhibition,
or
event
of
any
kind
for
which
an
admission
fee
is
charged
for
the
purpose
of
private
gain
and
profit.
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
there
is
no
newspaper
on
the
streets
of
cincinnati
which
does
not
constitute
a
commercial
handbill
under
the
city's
own
scheme
of
definitions.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
a
newspaper
can,
but
a
newspaper
is
not
defined.
a
newspaper
could
as
easily
fall
within
this
definition--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--as
any
other
definition.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
exactly.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
if
i
knew
what
a
newspaper
was
under
the
city's
scheme.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
well,
the
city
itself
has--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--no,
we
do
not.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
but
it
is
our
contention
that
we
are
no
more
commercial
within
the
city's
scheme
than
is
a
newspaper.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
i
believe
it's
the
distribution.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
they
may
be
sold
from
racks,
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
911-17
says
they
must
be
sold.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
no
longer.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
since
at
least
1971,
the
city
has
had
on
its
books
this
ordinance
which
prohibits
the
public
distribution
of
all
printed
matter
which
satisfies
the
city's
definition
of
a
commercial
handbill,
and
it
was
this
ordinance
which
the
city
invoked
when
they
directed
our
clients
to
remove
their
newsracks
only
from
the
city
right-of-way.
there's
no
question,
therefore,
that
this
scheme
is
subject
to
a
facial
challenge,
as
it
affects
not
only
the
use
of
newsracks
on
the
city
streets,
but
the
distribution
of
all
printed
matter
on
the
city
streets.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
and
714-1-n,
which
defines
as
a
noncommercial
handbill
anything
not
contained
in
the
definition
of
a
commercial
handbill.
this
scheme
obliterates
any
meaningful
or
discernible
distinction
among
publications.
if
our
publication
is
commercial,
so,
too,
is
a
daily
newspaper,
and
while
a
city
argues
that
there
should
be
or
is
a
bright
line
distinction,
the
first
amendment
purpose
as
between
commercial
and
noncommercial
speech,
its
inability
to
make
such
a
distinction
is
demonstrated
by
this
legislative
scheme
as
well
as
by
the
letter
regulation
by
the
city
manager,
who
advanced--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--no,
it
was
not.
the
court
of
appeals
looked
at
this
case
from
the
central
hudson--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--oh,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
decided
this
case--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--central
hudson.
[laughter]
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
yes.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reach
the
facial
argument,
they
decided
the
case
on
an
applied
basis,
but
certainly
this
is
a
fair
approach
to
this
regulatory
scheme,
because
it
continues
to
be
problematic.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
i
think
judge
boggs
who
wrote
the
opinion
was
quite
correct--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--yes.
shortly
after
our
publications
were
directed
to
be
removed
from
the
public
right-of-way
the
city
manager
passed
a
regulation
which
attempted
to
put
some
definition
into
the
city
scheme.
that
letter
regulation
defined
as
noncommercial
that
which
is
a
daily
or
weekly
publication
primarily
presenting
coverage
of
or
commentary
on
current
events,
and
as
we
know
from
the
record
below,
the
city
engineer
is
unable
and
remains
unable
to
give
a
clear
definition
of
what
constitutes
a
noncommercial
publication,
notwithstanding
the
city
manager's
letter.
while
the
city's
inability
to
establish
clear
standards
with
regard
to
a
distinction
between
noncommercial
and
commercial
speech
is
not
necessary
in
resolving
this
matter,
the
facial
infirmities
of
the
scheme
are
such
that
it
warrants
further
consideration
insofar
as
it
points
out
the
difficulties
in
dealing
with
speech
and
with
the
possibilities
of
favoritism
and
bias
when
a
city
is
unable
to
define
with
any
certainty
what
constitutes
commercial
and
what
constitutes
noncommercial.
in
this
situation,
that
threat
is
not
merely
potential
or
hypothetical.
we
believe
the
record
demonstrates
that
the
threat
is
palpable.
in
this
case,
the
record
reveals
that
the
city
of
cincinnati
works
on
an
ongoing
basis
with
certain
publishers,
namely
the
city's
daily
newspapers,
in
coming
up
with
regulations
governing
newsracks.
that's
significant,
because
it
indicates
that
there
is
a
threat
of
favoritism
or
bias
on
the
part
of
a
city
in
dealing
with
different
speakers,
when
the
speakers
are
essentially
publishing
the
same
types
of
materials.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
it
may
be
possible
to
draw
such
a
distinction,
but
there
would
be
no
need
for
a
distinction
insofar
as
newsracks
are
concerned.
if
the
city's
problem
here
is
newsracks,
then
it
ought
to
be
newsracks
which
it
regulates.
there's
no
reason
here,
certainly
none
developed
by
the
record,
which
would
demonstrate
a
need
to
regulate
newsracks
based
on
the
content
of
the
publications
contained
in
it.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
there
certainly
would
be
no
reason
to,
based
on
the
ostensible
reasons
for
the
city's
passing
the
codes.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
no,
it
may
not
be
attacked
necessarily
on
facial
grounds,
but
it
certainly
would
be
on
an
applied
basis
if,
as
in
this
instance,
the
city's
reasons,
which
ostensibly
are
safety
and
aesthetics,
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
content
of
the
publications.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
no,
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
permissible.
that
would
place
a
burden
on
speech
and
speakers
which
would
be
unnecessary
and
not
related
to
the
city's--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--i
think
under
those
circumstances
it
may
be
possible
for
the
city
to
do
that,
so
long
as
the
reason
for
that
ordinance
is
not
based
on
the
notion
that
to
be
commercial
or
noncommercial
is
determined
by
whether
or
not
you
charge
a
fee,
and
so
long
as
the
amount
of
money
that's
required
to
operate
that
machine
is
not
of
such
an
amount
that
it
would
place
a
burden
on
one
speaker
or
another.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
that
may
be
reasonable,
if
it
advances
a
legitimate
governmental
interest.
if
that
would
curb
the
problem,
perhaps--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--911-17,
justice
o'connor,
does
say
that
cities
are
permitted
to
sell
news--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--newspapers
by
newsracks.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
not
according
to
911-17,
but
our
publications
cannot
be
distributed
on
city
streets
by
any
means,
newsracks
or
otherwise.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
if
our
publishers
were
to
buy
space
in
the
city
newspapers,
that
potentially
could
happen,
but
that
would
change
our
entire
means
of
operation,
and
also,
of
course,
there's
never
any
guarantee
that
newspapers
will
accept
advertising
from
all
advertisers.
so
it
may
well
be
that
if
we
are
banned
from
newsracks
and
banned
from
distributing
by
hand
or
otherwise
in
public
areas,
we
may
be
totally
banned
from
distributing
our
publications
throughout
the
city
by
any
means.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
well,
i
think
that
would
present
a
large
problem
for
publishers
such
as
ours
who
do
not
have
the
financial
wherewithal--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--i
believe
that
there
is
underlying
the
right
to
distribute
speech
in
public
areas
the
right
to
erect
newspapers,
unless--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
that
if
a
city
has
a
scheme
of
regulation
by
which
publishers
are
licensed
to
use
space
in
accordance
with
terms
established
by
the
city
that
they
are
appropriating
public
property
for
private
purposes.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
depending
on
the
amount
of
money
needed
to
get
that
leasehold,
your
honor,
i
suppose
the
city
might
be
able
to
do
that,
so
long
as
that
scheme
is
not
contrary
to
public
forum
considerations.
after
all,
newsracks--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--public
forum
doctrine
speaks
to
a
tradition
in
this
country,
which
is
that
people
expect
to
see
and
be
seen
and
hear
and
be
heard
on
public
streets.
newsracks
meet
the
expectations
and
needs
of
citizens.
they're
found
in
virtually
every
city.
they're
found
on
many
street
corners.
that's
because
people
expect
to
find
them
there.
people
use
them.
the
use
of
newsracks
i
don't
believe,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
contrary
to
the
purposes
of
cities
regulating
streets.
it
seems
to
be
a
consistent
application.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
again,
i
think
perhaps
that
problem
may
be
addressed
by
whether
or
not
the
amount
of
money
charged
is
placing
too
large
a
burden
on
speech.
if
the
amount
of
money
would
not
be
such
as
to
prohibit
or
prevent
all
speakers
from
using
that
leasehold,
then
perhaps
in
those
circumstances
that
might
be
a
constitutional
ordinance.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
your
honor,
i
have
not
considered
that
issue
in
the
context
of
this
case
because
our
case
is
in
part
a
public
forum
case.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
chief
justice's--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--justice
o'connor,
your
question
poses
a
hypothetical
which
is
not
present
in
our
case,
that
being
limited
resources.
it's
important
to
note
that
in
this--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--the
answer
is,
in
the
absence
of
limited
resources--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--that
it
may
be
necessary
for
the
court
or
for
the
governing
body
to
make
some
distinctions.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
i
think
that--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--the
answer
is,
i'm
not
sure.
it
may
be
of
such
a
limited
space
that--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--the
court
has
placed
a
higher
priority
on
noncommercial
speech,
that
we
know,
but
only
when
it
is
necessary
to
regulate.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
that
situation
has
not
presented
itself
in
cincinnati,
but
it
could
be
that
we
get
down
to
a
last
street
corner,
and
i
would
suggest
that
in
those
circumstances
what
the
city
with
a
governing
body
must
do
is
develop
objective,
content-neutral
criteria
to
determine
who
that
final
speaker
will
be
on
that
street
corner.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
a
content-neutral
distinction.
if
here,
for
example,
the
problem
with
our
publications
is
that
it's
commercial
speech,
then
the
city
ought
to...
and
i'm
not
suggesting
this
is
what
they
ought
to
do,
but
to
be
fair
they
should
ban
all
commercial
speech,
that
contained
in
our
publications
and
that
which
falls
out
of
the
daily
newspapers
on
a
daily
basis.
they've
not
chosen
to
do
that,
nor
have
they
chosen...
what
they
have
chosen
to
do
is
make
a
distinction
based
on
content,
which
does
not
meet
the
city's
real
needs.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
it
is
our
position
that--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--no,
it
is
our
position--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--what
i
said
in
response
to
justice
o'connor,
justice
scalia,
is
that
there
may
be
such
a
limited
resource
situation
not
present
in
the
case
we
have
here--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--mr.
justice
scalia,
i
believe...
i
did
not
make
myself
as
clear
as
i
should
have.
i
believe
that
in
a
limited
resource
situation
the
governing
body
should
develop
objective,
content
neutral
basis
to
make
that
decision
about
what
speaker
is
there,
and
perhaps
i
did
misspeak
or
did
not
speak
as
clearly
as
i
should
have.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
unless
there
is
a
reason
to
grant--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--to
make
that
distinction,
which
is
not
present
here.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
there's
absolutely--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--there's
absolutely
nothing
here
in
the
record
to
establish--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--thank
you.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
i
do.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
i
could,
but
mr.
justice
stevens,
i
think
i
could
also
say
that
maybe
the
best
things
in
life
are
free,
in
response
to
your
question,
and
that
is
there's
no
record
here
to
establish
that
that
happens--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--and
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
that
necessarily
happens.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
justice
stevens,
if
someone
goes
to
the
newsrack
to
take
out
one
of
our
publications,
i
think
we
can
draw
the
inference
that-they
want
that
publication
because
it
affords
them
information
about
educational
and
economic
opportunities
which
are
valuable
to
them
and
they
will
take
that
with
them
just
as
they
would
a
daily
newspaper.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
well,
in
this
situation
they
have
to
go
to
the
box
and
remove
it.
it's
not
being
foisted
upon
them.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
yes,
whether
or
not
you
charge
or
do
not
charge
does
not
make
something
commercial
or
noncommercial.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
if
that
price,
as
i
indicated
before,
does
not
place
too
large
a
burden
on
one
speaker
or
another,
if
it's
an
inordinate
price,
or
if
it's
used
to
discriminate
against
one
speaker
than
another,
if
it
serves
a
legitimate
purpose,
if
25
cents
per
box
was--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--no,
we
would
not.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
if
the
25--
mr.
marc

--that's
correct,
it
could,
although
in
this
situation
the
regulatory
scheme
doesn't
just
place
a
burden
with
respect
to
newsracks,
the
city
would
have
us
off
the
city
streets
entirely,
by
any
means.
i
should
also
point
out
that
in
this
situation
there
were
62
newsracks
utilized
by
harmon
and
discovery's
publishers,
whereas
2,000
newsracks
approximately
would
be
permitted
to
remain
on
the
city
streets,
according
to
the
city's
enforcement
of
this
regulatory
scheme.
in
effect,
as
the
lower
courts
have
found,
this
scheme
is
an
ineffective
means
of
regulation.
it
never
directly
advances
any
legitimate
governmental
interest,
because
when
our
62
are
removed,
we
can
anticipate
that
they
will
be
replaced
by
62
supposed
noncommercial
speakers,
the
daily
newspapers.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
we
disputed
it
in
the
district
court
level.
we
did
not
appeal
the
district
court's
decision
that
we
are
commercial
speakers.
the
reason--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--no,
we
did
not.
we
feel
that
this
case
can
be
properly
decided
on
central
hudson
bases,
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
properly
applied
central
hudson--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--there
are
two
publications
here,
justice
white,
the
harmon
homes
contains
real
estate
listings,
a
picture
of
a
real
estate
offering,
price
information
about
that,
as
well
as,
from
time
to
time,
additional
information.
discovery's
publication
has
information
concerning
its
course
listings.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
to
the
extent
the
definition
of
commercial
speech
means
proposes
a
commercial
transaction,
then
indeed
it
does.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
that's
correct.
that's
one
of
the
problems
with
this
scheme,
is
that
it
is
devoid
of
any
meaningful
standards.
finally,
the
city
has
argued
that
the
regulations
in
this
case
are
content-neutral.
that
contention
is
unsupported
by
the
record.
first,
the
regulation
is
directed
expressly
and
explicitly
at
commercial
speech.
second,
only
publications
with
commercial
speech
has
been
banned
from
newsracks.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
that's
correct,
justice
souter.
the
city
by
invoking
this
ordinance
has
made
a
content-based--
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
--that's
correct.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
that's
correct.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
he
was
a
previous
city
manager.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
clear
in
the
record.
mr.
marc
d.
mezibov
there's
no
question
that
the
city
manager
can
promulgate
the
rules
and
regulations.
i
misunderstood
the
earlier
question.
i
understood
it
had
to
do
with
interpretation.
the
city
manager
does
promulgate
the
rules
and
regulations,
and
it
appears
to
be
left
to
other
city
officials
to
interpret
and
apply
those
rules
and
regulations.
in
this
case,
it
would
have
been
the
city
engineer,
primarily,
who
had
responsibility
to
interpret
and
then
apply
the
regulations.
