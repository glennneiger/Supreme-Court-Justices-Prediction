justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
respondents
are
a
class
of
alien
juveniles,
arrested
by
the
immigration
and
nationalization
service
on
suspicion
of
being
deportable
and
then
detained,
pending
their
deportation
hearings,
pursuant
to
an
ins
regulation,
codified
at
8
cfr
section
242.24.
that
regulation
provides
at
accepting
unusual
circumstances
the
only
individuals
who
be
given
custody
of
detained
juveniles,
are
their
parents,
close
relatives
or
legal
guardians.
juveniles,
for
whom
no
such
custodian
comes
forward,
are
placed
in
juvenile
care
facilities
that
meet
or
exceed
state
licensing
requirements
for
the
provision
of
services
to
dependent
children.
the
initial
deportability
determination
and
the
custody
determination
are
reviewable
by
an
immigration
judge
upon
the
juvenile's
request.
respondents
contend
that
they
have
a
right
under
the
constitution
and
under
immigration
laws
to
be
routinely
released
into
the
custody
of
other
unrelated
responsible
adults,
and
that
a
hearing
before
an
immigration
judge
must
be
held,
whether
or
not
the
juvenile
requests
it.
the
district
court
found
for
respondents,
the
court
of
appeals,
sitting
en
banc
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
reverse.
first,
we
hold
that
the
regulation
does
not
deprive
respondents
of
substantive
due
process.
the
substantive
rights
asserted
by
respondents
is
the
right
of
a
child
for
whom
the
government
is
temporarily
responsible,
to
be
placed
in
the
custody
of
an
unrelated
private
custodian,
rather
than
of
a
government
operated
or
government
selected
child
care
institution.
that
claim
is
too
novel
to
be
ranked
as
a
fundamental
right,
and
therefore
the
regulation
need
pass
no
more
stringent
attest
and
that
it
would
be
rationally
connected
to
the
government's
interest
in
protecting
the
welfare
of
the
detained
juveniles,
and
that
it
would
not
be
punitive.
we
find
that
it
passes
that
test.
nor
does
each
unaccompanied
juvenile
have
a
substantive
due
process
right
to
an
individualized
determination
of
whether
private
placement
would
be
in
that
child's
best
interests.
governmental
custody
must
meet
minimum
standards
as
we
conclude
the
institutional
custody
does
here
given
the
terms
of
a
prior
consent
decree.
but
the
decision,
whether
to
exceed
those
minimum
standards,
in
light
of
competing
demands
upon
agency
and
public
resources
is
a
policy
judgment,
not
a
constitutional
imperative.
any
remaining
constitutional
doubts
are
eliminated
by
the
fact
at
almost
all
respondents
are
aliens
suspected
to
being
deportable.
a
class
that
maybe
detained,
and
over
which
congress
has
met
to
the
attorney
general
broad
discretion
regarding
detention.
at
the
respondents
procedural
due
process
claim,
procedures
provided
by
the
ins
are
not
rendered
invalid
by
their
failure
to
require
automatic
review
by
an
immigration
judge
of
the
initial
deportability
and
custody
determinations.
this
is
a
facial
challenge
to
the
regulation,
which
means
that
respondents
must
show
that
no
set
of
circumstances
exists
under
which
the
regulation
would
be
valid.
affording
the
right
to
review
suffices,
since
it
appears
that
most
of
the
juveniles
detained,
are
neither
too
young
nor
too
ignorant
to
exercise
the
right
to
ask
for
an
appeal.
at
disposes
of
the
constitutional
claims
as
for
the
statutory
claim,
we
hold
that
the
regulation
is
not
an
abuse
of
the
attorney
general's
discretion
to
continue
custody
over
arrested
juveniles
under
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
the
regulation
seeks
to
strike
a
balance
between
the
services
concern
that
the
juvenile's
welfare
will
not
permit
their
release
to
just
any
adult,
and
the
services
assessment
that
it
has
neither
the
expertise
nor
the
resources
to
conduct
home
studies
for
individualized
placements.
if
therefore
permits
release
to
parents
and
close
relatives
who
are
traditionally
regarded
as
competent
custodians,
but
otherwise
requires
an
individual
seeking
custody
to
obtain
an
appointment
as
guardian
from
the
states
which
are
accustomed
to
evaluating
the
appropriateness
of
individual
custodians.
the
period
of
institutional
custody
that
we
note
is
limited
by
the
pending
deportation
hearing,
which
must
be
concluded
with
reasonable
dispatch
in
order
to
avoid
habeas
corpus.
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceeding
consistent
with
this
opinion.
