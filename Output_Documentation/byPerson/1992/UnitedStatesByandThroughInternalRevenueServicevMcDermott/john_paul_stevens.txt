justice
john
paul
stevens
is
your
argument
that
nothing
turns
on
when
the
federal
tax
lien
was
perfected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
the
same
as
perfected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
everything
turns
on
when
the
judgement
creditor's
lien
perfected,
but
nothing
turns
on
when
the
government's
lien
was
perfected?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
happens
with
the
proceeds
in
a
title
company?
suppose
the
judgment
lien
creditor
is
superior
to
the
government
because
its
lien
was
perfected
before
the
assessment
and
before
notice
of
the
lien,
and
then
the
property
is
sold
and
money
is
sitting
in
the
escrow
company.
does
the
judgment
creditor's
lien
follow
that
money,
or
is
this
after-acquired
property
so
that
the
government's
subsequent
lien
could
now
attach
and
be
superior?
justice
stevens
mr.
feldman,
i
do
have
a
question.
i
meant
to
ask
this
before.
at
page
14
of
your
brief
you
address
the
hypothesis
that
the
liens
were,
became,
were
perfected
simultaneously,
and
you
say
in
effect
that
the
statute
says
that
if
the
private
lien
were
not,
did
not
attach
first
then
the
government,
the
government
wins
a
tie.
and
you
seem
to
be
quoting
the
statute,
but
i
don't
think
the
statute
says
that.
and
i
wonder
could
you
comment
a
little
bit
on
what,
why
you
would
say
if
there
were
a
tie
you
wouldn't
somehow
or
other
share
the
proceeds
or
something,
but
rather
would
give
the
government
priority?
justice
stevens
but
this
is,
there's
no
specific
statutory
provision
addressing
the
question,
is
there?
justice
stevens
that's
what
you'd
rely
on?
