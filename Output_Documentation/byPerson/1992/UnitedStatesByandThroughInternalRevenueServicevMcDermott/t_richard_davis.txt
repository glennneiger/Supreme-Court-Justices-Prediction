mr.
t.
richard
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1827
justice
john
marshall
enunciated
what
was,
he
deemed,
a
cardinal
rule,
which
was
a
prior
lien
gives
a
prior
claim
entitled
to
prior
satisfaction
from
the
subjected
binds.
this
has
become
known
as
the
doctrine
of
first
in
time
as
first
in
right,
and
it
has
become
the
general
federal
common
law
in
the
area
of
competing
lien
claims.
this
has
also
been
adopted
and
codified
by
use
of
the,
for
the
government
in
establishing
the
competing
liens
between
a
federal
tax
lien
and
certain
competing
liens
as
provided
in
section
6323.
because
of
a
contractual
stipulation
which
preceded
the
litigation
in
this
matter
and
the
acquiescence
by
the
irs
in
the
tenth
circuit
opinion
in
all
but
one
issue,
the
facts
of
this
case
are
very
simple
and
make
a
singular
issue
presented
to
this
court.
that
is
will
this
court
apply
the
first
in
time
rule
in
favor
of
a
prior
perfected
judgment
lien
over
a
subsequently
filed
federal
tax
lien
when
property
purchased
by
the,
as
against
property
purchased
by
the
debtor
subsequent
to
all
the
liens,
the
after-acquired
issue.
the
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
it
is
important
to
note
that
zions
bank
did
everything
that
was
required
of
it
to
perfect
under
state
law
a
general
lien
on
all
real
property
owned
by
the
debtor
located
in
the
county
of
salt
lake.
section
6232
does
not
explicitly
resolve
the
issue
of
after-acquired
property,
but
it
provides
the
framework
which,
very
compatibly
with
prior
decisions
of
this
court
and
with
the
intentions
of
congress
as
shown
since
the
institution
of
the
federal
tax
lien
in
1866,
allows
a
consistent
pattern
of
recognizing
the
integrity
of
a
judicial
judgment
lien
obtained
by
a
private
party.
mr.
t.
richard
davis
i
do
not.
that
is
correct.
mr.
t.
richard
davis
not
pursuant...
that
is
correct
as
the
facts
in
this
case
have
been
shaved
down.
both
parties
have,
they
abandon
whatever
rights
they
had
to
any
property
of
mr.
mcdermott,
or
any
rights
they
had
to
this
property
until
the
property
was
repurchased
by
mcdermott
at
the
foreclosure
sale.
then
both
liens
attached
to
that
property
simultaneously.
the
question
is
whether
the
prior
entry
of
the
judgment
lien
has
any
effect
at
all
as
against
a
subsequent
filing
of
the
notice
of
tax
lien.
we
believe
it
does.
the
choateness
doctrine,
as
it
has
been
declared
by
this
court,
was
codified
by
the
treasury
department
in
its
regulations.
it
requires,
it
sets
forth,
as
counsel
has
stated,
a
requirement
of
the
establishment
of
the
amount
of
the
lien,
the
identity
or
the
lienor,
and
the
establishment
of
what
property
is
to
be
liened.
the
property,
being
general
in
nature,
is
sufficient
under
prior
pronouncements
of
this
court.
mr.
t.
richard
davis
this
issue,
i
think
it's
a
difference
between
the
word
identified
and
established.
the
standard
is
not
now,
nor
ever
has
it
been
through
this
court
or
by
statute,
that
the
property
must
be
identified,
merely
that
it
must
be
established.
that
was
the
issue
which
came
before
this
court
in
both
the
new
britain
and
vermont
cases.
both
of
them
sought...
well,
the
most
relevant
one
would
be
the
vermont
case
wherein
a
prior
state
lien
which
was
general
in
nature
was
attacked
by
the
general
federal
tax
lien,
which
was
also
general.
this
court
held
that
the
fact
that
the
state
lien
was
general
in
nature,
covering
all
of
the
property,
it
identified
no
property
in
particular,
was
sufficient.
mr.
t.
richard
davis
there's
no
question
the
facts
are
different,
and
i
agree,
but
i
think
this
is
not
an
illogical
step
to
say
that
a
general
lien
which
is
established
upon
all
property,
either
now
or
hereafter
acquired,
is
still
on
all
property,
whether
now
or
hereafter
acquired.
and
the
establishment
is
set
forth.
it's
not
the
identity
that's
important,
but
it's
the
establishment
of
that
property,
the
fact
that
it's
all
property.
that's
how
i
read
that
case.
mr.
t.
richard
davis
i
believe
that's
the
case
with
the
uniform
commercial
code.
i
believe
there
is
a
distinction
between
personal
property
and
real
property,
and
we're
only
dealing
with
real
property.
the
common
law
in
the
state
of
utah
and
the
federal
common
law
is
predicated
upon
first
in
time
and
first
in
right
and
does
not
require
that
that
property
be
specifically
identified.
all
property
which
is
covered
by
a
lien
is
subject
to
that
lien
when
it
states
all
property.
i
believe
that
the
uniform
commercial
code
is
directed
only
to
personal
property
because
of
its
nature,
which
can,
it
can
be
consumed
or
transported
and
other
issues
that
way.
as
far
as
real
property
it
stays
and
is
subject
to
permanency
as
set
forth
in
the
recorder's
office
in
the
relevant
county.
mr.
t.
richard
davis
certainly
there
could
be
no
lien
until
the
property
was
established
upon
which
that
lien
could
be
set.
mr.
t.
richard
davis
the
debtor
had
no
real
property
interest
in
that,
in
the
south
street
property,
that's
correct.
mr.
t.
richard
davis
it's
not
controlled
by
it,
it's
just
the
same
reasoning
that
i
would
put
forth
that
a
specific
lien
is
not
required,
a
general
is
sufficient.
mr.
t.
richard
davis
it
would
be
discoverable,
that's
correct.
mr.
t.
richard
davis
generally
that
is
correct.
this
case
had
specific
facts
which
made
it
different
as
a
matter
of
fact.
zions
did
understand
and
the
fact
that
it
would,
that
the
debtor
would
be
obtaining
title
to
that
property
soon
or
there
was
a
good
chance
that
was
happening,
because--
mr.
t.
richard
davis
--that
did
not
affect
the
lien,
but
it
gave,
zions
had
knowledge
that
that
would
be
coming
into,
that
the
property
would
be
coming
into
mr.
mcdermott's
hands
because
of
the
nature
and
the
assessing
of
the
foreclosure
notices.
mr.
t.
richard
davis
all
parties
had
knowledge
because
that
was
recorded.
for
the
foreclosure
a
lien,
a
notice
of
the
foreclosure
had
to
be
filed.
that
was
why,
and
it's
that
issue
of
reliance
which
was
addressed
earlier
which
is
important.
reliance
was
important
to
a
judgment
lien.
a
creditor
who
has
a
lien
or
who
has
a
claim
against
a
party
will
not
pursue
that
party
if
he
knows
the
party
is
impecunious,
if
he
knows
there
will
be
no
property
thereafter
to
obtain.
in
this
case
and
in
many
cases
where
the
creditor
understands
that
the
party
is
going
to
be
obtaining
property
either
through
foreclosure
or
gift
or
devise
or
some
such
way,
there
would
be
a
reliance
that
was
exercised
on
the
half
of
that
judgment
lien
creditor.
mr.
t.
richard
davis
i
think
the
statute
is
silent
as
to
after
acquired
property.
i
think
the
framework
which
allows
the
recognition
of
a
general
lien
is
as
far
as
we
can
go
in
looking
at
the
statute
to
find
whether
this
will
fit
within
the
choateness
doctrine.
mr.
t.
richard
davis
i
think
the
reason
for,
the
choateness
doctrine
requires
that
the
lien
be,
that
the
lienor
be
identified,
the
amount
be
ascertained,
and
the
property
be
established.
i
believe
the
reason
for
that
is
so
that
anyone
else
can
rely
upon
what
that
lien
is
all
about.
i
think
the
service
is
entitled
to
reliance
also
upon
the
actions
of
other
entities.
i
think
that
congress,
not
only
in
1966
but
beginning
in
1913
and
again
in
1939,
began
not
to
cut
back
on
private
competitors
with
federal
tax
liens,
rather
to
allow
those
liens
to
compete
fairly
as
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
federal
tax
lien.
i
think
the,
it's
important
to
understand
the
time
of
perfection
in
either
lien
or
both
liens
is
important
in
any
case,
whether
it's
before
or
after
the
acquisition
of
property
to
which
that
lien
will
apply,
to
encourage
the
diligence
of
filing,
the
diligence
of
enforcement
of
claims
and
liens
upon
property.
if
that
does
not
happen
the
secret
lien
doctrine,
which
was
the
beginning
doctrine
which
was
used
in
1866,
then
carries
over.
basically
what
we
have
here
is
a
secret
lien
of
the
united
states
which
comes
in
and
primes
a
lien
which
was
placed
by
a
private
lien
claimant.
i
believe
that
the
congressional
intent
clearly,
under
1966
acts
and
prior
to
that
as
reviewed
by
various
federal
courts,
states
that
the
purpose
of
that
act
was
merely
to
put
them
on
equal
footing
and
encourage
both
parties
to
act
diligently
in
obtaining
what
rights
they
are
going
to
receive.
only
two
circuits
have
looked
at
simultaneous
attaching
or
perfection.
those
are
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
southern
rock
case,
and
the
tenth
circuit
in
mcdermott.
both
circuits
saw
that
it
was
important
to
encourage
the
diligence,
encourage
that
parties
can
rely
upon
record
title
acts
in
the
various
counties
in
which
the
liens
are
set.
zions
acted
diligently.
it
performed
all
acts
required
of
the
bank
to
perfect
its
general
lien
on
all
of
mr.
mcdermott's
real
property
located
in
salt
lake
county.
it
is
neither
logical
nor
equitable
to
allow
a
2
month
later
lien
come
and
prime
and
subordinate
the
bank's
lien.
the
integrity
of
the
record
title
acts
throughout
the
county
or
the
country
relies
on
the
consistent
judicial
support
of
preferring
a
prior
recorded
lien
to
those
subsequently
recorded.
the
judicial
and
legislative
preference
for
justice
marshall's
cardinal
rule
over
the
irs's
current
desire
to
resurrect
the
secret
lien
doctrine
must
continue
to
protect
all
creditors
and
preserve
confidence
in
the
system.
if
i
might
digress
a
bit
on
the
1966
act,
as
the,
as
counsel
mentioned,
that
several
amendments
to
that
act
showed
that
congress
tried
to
cut
back
on
private
rights.
basically
those
concerned
issues
which
are
not
relevant
to
this
matter.
the
ucc
issue,
the
purchased
money
security
interest,
neither
of
those
are
relevant
to
this
case
nor
the
issues
at
this
court.
basically
the
congress
gave
the
judgment
lien
creditor
a
priority
to
act
on
an
equal
footing
requiring
recording,
perfection
in
a
traditional
manner
of
perfection
of
real
estate
liens,
equally,
without
regard
to
the
supreme
rights
of
the
sovereign.
this
court
can
accomplish
the
reaffirmation
of
the
principle
of
first
in
time
by
reaffirming,
by
affirming
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit
and
allowing
the
general
lien
to
have
attached
effectively
to
the
after-acquired
property.
thank
you.
