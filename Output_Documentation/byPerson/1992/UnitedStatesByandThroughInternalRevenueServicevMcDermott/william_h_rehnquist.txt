chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
91-1229,
united
states,
by
and
through
the
internal
revenue
service
v.
bruce
j.
mcdermott.
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
south
street
property
here
had
been
purchased
with
an
exchange
of
other
real
property
to
which
the
judgment
creditor's
lien
had
attached,
then
surely
it
would
carry
over
to
the
south
street
property,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
was
the,
what
was
the
consideration
for
the
acquisition
of
the
south
street
property?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
therefore
the
judgment
creditor
lien
didn't
attach?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
reasoning
in
those
cases?
would
interest
that
accrued
later
be
junior
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
reasoning
of
the
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
go
for
interest
too,
i
would
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
a
rather
strange
ruling.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
agree,
don't
you,
mr.
feldman,
that
if
the
south
street
property
had
been
owned
by
the
debtor
here
at
the
time
that
the
judgment
lien
was
filed
in
salt
lake
county,
then
the
judgment
creditor
lien
would
be
prior?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
davis,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government's
argument,
mr.
davis,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
property
used
to
purchase
the
south
street
property
was
property
to
which
the
judgment
creditor's
lien
did
not
attach
under
utah
law.
do
you
dispute
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
when
the
south
street
property
came
into
the
hands
of
the
debtor
it
had
not
been
previously
subject
to
any
lien
under
state
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
sure.
in
the
vermont
case,
mr.
davis,
the,
as
i
understand
it
under
vermont
law
the
lien
attached
to
all
of
the
debtor's
real
property
and
it
wasn't
any
more
specific
than
that,
but
you
could
at
least
go
into
county
or
i
guess
in
vermont
town
recording
offices
and
find
out
what
property
the
debtor
had
as
of
the
time.
here
in
july
there
was
no
way
to
identify
the
south
street
property
as
property
of
the
debtor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no...
yeah,
no
real
property,
so
this
is
certainly
a
case
that
is
not
in
any
way
controlled
by
the
vermont
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but,
but
in,
the
words
may
not
be
all
that
important
but
under
vermont
law
as
of
the
time
the
lien
was
filed
you
could,
you
knew
what
specific
pieces
of
real
property
that
lien
attached
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
and
under
your
theory
certainly
that
wouldn't
be
the
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't,
that
doesn't
affect
the
lien.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
can't
bind
another
judgment
and
it
certainly
can't
bind
the
government,
the
fact
that
zions
may
have
had
knowledge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
does
that
fit
into
the
congressional
statute
here,
the
fact
that
the
competing
judgment
lien
creditor
may
have
relied
on
the
judgment
debtor
to
eventually
acquire
property?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
didn't
know
that
choateness
had
anything
to
do
with
reliance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
davis.
mr.
feldman,
you
have
12
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
did
your,
why
did
the
government's
federal
tax
lien
in
september
attach
to
the
south
street
property
when
the
earlier
july
lien
didn't?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
answer
my
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why?
because
your
lien
covered
personal
property
as
well
as
real
property?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
when
did
your
lien
take
effect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
your
lien
as
of
the
date
of
filing
covered
the
south
street
property?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
obviously,
you
know,
you're
not,
you
don't
feel
comfortable
saying
yes.
why
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
permit
me
an
irrelevant
question
then.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
attached
to
the
south
street
property.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
no.
91-1229,
united
states
against
mcdermott
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
