mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
relative
priority
of
a
federal
tax
lien
and
a
private
state
law
lien
as
to
a
specific
piece
of
real
property
that
was
acquired
by
the
debtor
after
the
date
the
federal
tax
lien
was
filed.
it
is
after-acquired
property
in
that
sense.
the
relevant
facts
can
be
summarized
simply.
the
federal
tax
liens
at
issue
in
this
case
arose
on
december
29,
1986
at
the
time
the
taxes
against
the
debtor
were
assessed.
on
july
6,
1987
respondent
zions
docketed
its
judgment
against
the
debtors.
that
judgment
under
state
law
constituted
a
lien
against
the
debtors'
real
property,
then
owned
and
after-acquired.
on
september
9,
1987,
about
2
and
a
half
months
later,
the
irs
filed
a
notice
of
federal
tax
lien.
and
finally
about
2
weeks
after
that
on
september
23,
1987
the
debtors
acquired
the
subject
property
known
as
the
south
street
property,
the
right
to
which
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
order
therefore
was
the
federal
tax
lien
arose,
then
the
state
judgment
was
docketed,
then
the
federal
tax
lien
was
filed,
and
then
the
debtors
acquired
the
property.
and
the
question
is
whether
the
irs's
lien
has
priority
as
to
that
piece
of
after-acquired
property.
the
general
rule
as
to
the
priority
of
a
federal
tax
lien
is
that
a
federal
tax
lien
has
priority
over
all
competing
interests
unless
at
the
time
the
federal
tax
lien
arose
the
competing
interest
was
specific
and
perfected.
the
rationale,
i
think,
of
that
rule
is
that
the
federal
tax
lien
can
only
take
so
much
of
the
property
as
is
the
debtors'
and
if
at
the
time
the
federal
tax
lien
arises
some
other
lien
has
come
and
essentially
grabbed
a
part
of
that
property,
the
federal
tax
lien
can
only
take
the
balance
of
the
interest
that
was
the
debtors'.
now,
there
are
exceptions
to
that
rule
and
one
of
the
exceptions
is
section
6323(a),
and
that
provides
that
a
federal
tax
lien
is
not
valid
against
a
judgment
lien
until
the
federal
tax
lien
is
filed.
now
respondent
claims
that
in
this
case,
this
case
arises,
he
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
6323(a),
and
the
effect
of
that
provision
therefore
is
just
to
move
the
date
from
the
date
of
assessment,
from
the
date
the
tax
lien
arises
on
which
you
determine
priorities,
to
move
the
date
until
the
date
the
tax
lien
was
filed,
which
in
this
case
was
september
9,
1987.
i
think
there
are
thus
two
issues
in
this
case.
the
primary
question
and
the
one
that
the
court
of
appeals
got
wrong
was
whether
the
debtors'
interest
was
specific
and
perfected
as
of
september
9,
1987.
in
our
view,
i
mean,
in
our
view
the
lienholder's
interest
was
not
specific
and
perfected
as
of
that
date,
and
accordingly
the
tax
lien
would
have
priority.
there
is
a
second
question
which
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
rely
on,
but
i
think
maybe
the
district
court
did,
and
that
is
whether
the
fact
that
the
federal
tax
lien
attached
to
the
property
at
the
same
time
as
the
state
tax,
as
the
judgment
lien,
whether
that
alters
the
result
that
would
follow
from
a
finding
that
the
state
lien
wasn't
specific
and
perfected
as
of
the
date
of
filing
of
the
federal
tax
lien.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if,
well,
i
think
that
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
decided
in
the
case
of
united
states
against
vermont.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
the
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
a
lien
is
sufficiently
specific,
that
is
if
it
just
identifies
all
of
the
debtor's
property
rather
than
giving
a
specific
legal
description
of
the
property.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
and
this
court
held
that
that
was
sufficiently
specific.
and
i
think
the
task
that
is
derived
from
vermont
is
whether,
on
the
date
of
filing
of
the
federal
tax
lien
whether,
if
you
can
determine
on
that
date
that
a
particular
piece
of
property
was
subject
to
the
judgment
lien,
then
it
was
specific
and
perfected
on
that
date.
if
you
can't--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
i
don't
think...
there's
no
question
under
state
law
that
judgment
lien--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
we
don't
think
specificity
is
a
problem.
the
problem
is
that
under
the
settled
task
for
whether
a
judgment
lien
is
specific
and
perfected
is
whether
the
identity
of
the
lien
or
the
amount
of
the
lien
and
the
property
subject
to
the
lien
were
established.
in
this
case
the
property
subject
to
the
lien
was
not
established
as
of
the
date
on
which
you
measure
the
priorities,
which
is
september
9,
1987.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
that
actually
gets
to
the
second
question
i
mentioned.
both
liens
attached
to
the
property
at
the
same
time,
but
there's
nothing
hinges
on
when
the
federal
lien
attached
to
the
property.
the
case
turns
on,
the
question
is
whether
as
of
the
date
of
notice
whether
the
state
lien
had
already
attached
to
the
property.
and
since,
in
our
view
since
it
hadn't--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
primarily.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
he
does.
i
think
actually
if
you
look
at
the
statute
and
you
look
at
what
congress
did
in
1966
when
it
overhauled
the
statute
and
passed
the
tax
lien
act,
it
specifically
dealt
with
the
question
of
after-acquired
property
and
it
looked
at
all
the
types
of
after-acquired
property
and
types
of
security
interests
and
made
a
narrow
exception
to
the
general
rule
of
federal
priority
as
of
the
date
of
notice
was
filed,
a
narrow
exception
to
that
rule
for
certain
kinds
of
commercial
financing
transactions,
only
as
to
certain
kinds
of
property,
and
only
for
a
limited
period
of
time,
that
is
45
days
after
the
tax
lien
was
filed.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it's
a
little
bit
hard
to
answer
that
question
because
the
federal
tax
lien,
i'm
not
sure
what,
how,
that
is
not
something
that
is
governed
by
the
uniform
commercial
code.
there
would
be
some
interest
in
property,
certainly
the
interest
of
a
purchased
money
lender
or
the
interest
of
an
inventory
financier
or
an
accounts
receivable
financier,
just
the
parties
who
are
protected
by
the
tax
lien
act.
those
interests
under
the
ucc
as
a
general
matter,
although
it's
quite
complex,
would
have
priority
over
a
judgment
lien
creditor
as
to
the
after-acquired
property.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
a
federal
tax
lien
itself
is
not
subject
to
the
ucc
and
it's
difficult
to
say
what,
there's
no,
really
no
other
way
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
nothing
turns
on
when
it
attached,
and
i
think
that
follows
from
a
number
of--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
i
think
that's
part
of
perfection.
if
you
look
at
the
test
for
perfection
it's
whether
the
identity
of
the
lienholder,
the
amount
of
the
lien,
and
the
property
subject
to
the
lien
was
established.
and
i
think
part
of
establishing
that
the
property
was
subject
to
the
lien
was
establishing
that
this
particular
lien
had
taken
hold
of
this
particular
property.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
the
relevant
thing
you
do
is
take,
what
you
do
is
you
take
a
snap
shot
of
the
situation
as
of,
in
ordinary
cases
as
of
the
date
the
federal
taxes
were
assessed,
but
in
cases
under
6323(a)
at
the
date
that
the
tax
lien
was
filed.
you
take
a
snap
shot
of
that
situation
and
say
as
of
that
date
had
the
judgment
lien
attached
to
the
property
at,
was
a
definite
amount,
was
the
identity
of
the
lienholder
specific.
if
it
wasn't,
then
the
tax
lien
takes
the
property
and
the
judgment
lien
is
junior
to
it.
if
it
had
already
attached
to
that
property
and
was
established
as
of
that
date
that
that
particular
piece
of
property
was
subject
to
the
lien,
then
that
lien
would
be
superior
to
the
federal
tax
lien.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
question
there
would
be
whether
you
trace
the
proceeds
of
the
property,
whether
the
lien
on
the
property
attaches
also...
you
trace
the
priorities
through
to
the
proceeds.
i
can't
tell
you
for
sure.
i
think
that
you
do,
but
i
can't
give
you
a
firm
answer
on
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
i
would
think
it
would.
in
this
case
it
wasn't,
the
debtor
had
no
rights
in
the
south
street
property
to
which
the
judgment
lien
could
attach
as
of
september
9.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
debtor
had
previously
owned
the
property
and
had
sold
the
property.
he
had
essentially
what
amounts
to
a
mortgage,
except
that
under
utah
state
law
in
this
circumstance
it
was
considered
an
interest
in
real
property,
in
personal
property
and
not
real
property.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
didn't
attach
because
it
was
personal
property
at
that
time
and
the
judgment
lien
only
attaches
under
state
law
to
real
property.
it
was
only
when
that
interest
became
a
real
property
interest
of
the
debtors,
which
was
on
september
23,
after
the
federal
tax
lien
was
filed,
it
was
only
then
that
the
judgment
lien
attached
to
the
property.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
our
position
is
that,
if
you
mean
a
case
of
simultaneous
attachment,
if
we're
talking
specifically
about
that
type
of
perfection--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
would
be
our
view
that
both
the
amendments,
the
clear
intent
of
the
amendments
which
is
to
limit
the
extent
of
a
security
interest
in
after-acquired
property
for
a
period
of
45
days
and
only
in
certain
given
cases
which
did
not
include
judgment
liens,
it
would
be
our
position
that
both
that
and
6323(a)
and
(c),
i'm
sorry,
6321
and
6323(a),
all
of
those
support
our
position.
6321,
which
is
the
basic
rule,
says
that
the
federal
tax
lien
arises
at
the
time
the
taxes
are
assessed.
it
doesn't
say
at
the
time
the
taxes
are
assessed
or
attached,
whichever
is
later,
or
if
there
is
some
kind
of
perfection
that
it
arises
at
a
different
time.
that
states
a
federal
rule
that
for
purposes
of,
for
federal
law
the
federal
tax
lien
arises
at
the
date
the
taxes
are
assessed.
now,
6323(a)
switches
that,
moves
that,
just
simply
moves
that
date
back
to
the
date
that
the
notice
is
filed,
but
you
still
do
the
same
thing
on
that
date
that
you
would
do
in
one
of
the
other
cases
under
6321,
which
is
you
look
as
of
that
date
as
to
whether
the
judgment
lien
had
attached.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
guess,
i
think
the
import
of
our
argument
is
that
the
date
that
the
federal
tax
lien
attaches
in
an
after-acquired
property
case
is
not
a
legally
significant
date,
that
congress
set
those
legally
significant
dates
as
being
either
when
they're
assessed
or
when
the
tax
lien
is
filed.
the
fact
that
it
attached
at
a
later
date
is
not
legally
significant.
and
in
fact
when
congress
considered
the
after-acquired
property
issue,
in
all
cases
of
after-acquired
property
you're
going
to
have
situations
similar
to
this
in
which
the
state
lien
and
the
federal
lien,
or
the
judgment
lien
and
the
tax
lien
attach
at
the
same
moment
to
the
property.
congress
wanted
to
limit
the
cases
in
which
a
private
party
could
have
superiority
over
the
federal
tax
lien
among
those
cases
of
after-acquired
property
in
very
limited
ways,
only
for
a
period
of
45
days,
for
example.
if
the
court
of
appeals
were
right
here
the
judgment
creditor
has
a
far
superior
interest
to
those
the
congress
specifically
wanted
to
give
priority
to
in
the
tax
lien
act
because
the
judgment
lien
would
be
good
indefinitely
for
after-acquired
property.
if
the
debt...
it's
true
in
this
case
it
was
2
weeks,
but
if
the
debtor
had
acquired
the
property
a
year
later
under
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
the
result
would
have
been
exactly
the
same.
and
i
don't
think
that's
consistent
with
what
was
congress'
decision
to
limit
very
carefully
the
classes
of
after-acquired
property
that
would
have,
as
to
which
a
private
creditor
would
have
superiority
over
the
federal
lien.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
because
that's
where
it--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
it's
not.
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
the,
i
think
the
rule
of
law
that
we're
suggesting
governs
this
case
was
clear
long
before
1966.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
have
to
rely
on
that,
but
i
do
think
congress
then
enacted
those
amendments
in
1966
in
reliance
on
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
and
i
think
that
by
enacting
the
statute
that
it
did
in
1966
it
really
adopted
that
prior
law,
and
the
exceptions
to
the
rules
about
after-acquired
that
it
enacted
in
1966
wouldn't
make
any
sense
if
it
turned
out
that
other,
all
kinds
of
other
security
interests
other
than
the
ones
congress
named
had
a
priority
over
the
federal
lien
that
was
so
much
more
substantial
than
the
priority
that
congress
chose
to
give
the
particular
classes
of
creditors.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
in
the
brief...
excuse
me?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
oh,
no,
it
was
in
our
brief.
it
was
on
about
page
15,
the
section
from
15
to
18
addresses
the
1966
act.
i
think
there
is
another
line
of
cases
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--there's
another
line
of
cases
that
also
suggests
the
same
result,
and
that
is
this
court
has
never
specifically
addressed
a
case
involved
after-acquired
property
but
it
has
addressed
cases
involving
a
very
closely
analogous
situation,
and
that
is
what
might
be
called
after-acquired
debt
or
after-incurred
debt.
in
the
cases
of
united
states
against
pioneer
american
insurance,
united
states
against
equitable
life
insurance,
those
cases
involved
mortgages
that
included
clauses
providing
that
if
the
mortgage
was
foreclosed
that
the
attorneys'
fees
for
the
foreclosure
would
be
added
to
the
principal
amount
of
the
debt
due
secured
by
the
property.
in
both
of
those...
and
so
those
cases
involved
after-incurred
debt,
a
debt
that
is
added
on
to
the
secured
amount.
in
both
of
those
cases
those
attorneys'
fees
were
incurred
after
the
federal
tax
lien
was
filed,
and
in
both
of
those
cases
this
court
held
that
that
after-incurred
debt,
that
the
security
interest
as
to
that
after-incurred
debt
was
junior
to
that
of
the
federal
tax
lien.
i
think
the
same
result,
there's
no
reason
not
to
adopt
the
same
reasoning
and
the
same
result--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--you
know,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
rule
was
before
1966
as
to
interest.
i
believe
that
in
1966
congress
specifically
provided
for
interest
and
actually
provided
for
some
other
kinds
of
costs
that
were
attendant,
for
instance
on
a
mortgage,
to
be
included
in
the
principal
amount
as
a
specific
exception
to
the
general
rule.
but
the
point
was
that
these
after-incurred
debts
in
this
court,
this
court
decided
in
two
different
decisions
that
these
after-incurred
debts,
even
if
they
were
relatively
certain
in
amount
and
relatively
certain
to
be
incurred,
that
the
security
interest
as
to
those
debts
was
junior
to
the
federal
tax
lien.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
was
applying
the
test
for
perfection
that
i
have
suggested
here,
which
is,
in
those
cases
the
amount
of
the
debt...
you
remember
the
test
requires
the
identity
of
the
lienholder,
the
amount
of
the
debt,
and
the
property
subject
to
the
debt
be
established.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
probably
would,
yes.
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
well,
congress
did
take
care
of
some
of
those
situations
elsewhere
in
the
amendments
in
provisions
other
than
those
that
i
was
talking
about
before.
in
any
event,
i
don't,
there's
no
reason
why
the,
why
if
the
amount
of
the
debt
was
not
clear
because
the
debt
hadn't
actually
been
incurred
at
the
date
of
filing,
therefore
the
interest
in
that,
that
after-incurred
debt
was
not
superior
to
the
federal
tax
lien,
there's
no
reason
why
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
that
after-acquired
property
should
be
treated
any
better.
i
think
those
cases
provide
a
close
analogy
to
the
decision
that
should
be
reached
here.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
if
the
taxpayer
acquired
an
interest
in
that
property,
a
real
property,
an
interest
in
the
property
recognized
by
state
law
between
july
9,
1987
and
september
9,
1987,
at
any
point
during
that
time,
that
interest,
the
judgment
lien
would
have
a
superior
interest
in
that
property
to
the
federal
tax
lien.
but
it's
our,
in
this
case
because
the
debtors'
interest
in
the
property
was
not
acquired
until
after
the
federal
tax
lien
was
filed,
the
federal
lien
should
be
superior.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
just
wanted
to
mention,
mr.
chief
justice
section
6323(e),
in
response
to
your
question
before,
would
give
the
holder
of
a
security
interest
that's
superior
to
a
tax
lien
a
right
to
the
interest
that
accrues
even
after
the
tax
lien
was
filed.
that's
6323(e).
mr.
james
a.
feldman
if
there's
no
other
questions--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yeah,
i
mean,
there's
two,
i
think
there's
two
distinct
questions
there.
one
is
where
there
really
is
a
tie
would
be
a
case,
i
would
regard
a
case
as
for
instance
the
fifth
circuit
case,
the
southern
rock
case,
where
there
really
was
simultaneously
with
the
federal
filing
there
was
a
state
filing,
and
that
would
be
a
real
tie
case.
i
think
the
underlying
rationale,
even
in
a
case
like
that
the
government
should
win,
because
i
think
the
underlying
rationale
is
that
unless
the
prior,
is
that
the
federal
tax
lien
is
a
very
potent
form
of
lien
and
unless
at
the
time
the
federal
tax
lien
either
arises
or
is
filed,
if
at
that
moment
the
other
lien
hasn't
already
taken
the
property
the
federal
tax
lien
is
what
attaches
to
the
debtor's
property
and
has
a
superior
interest
then.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that
you
could
read
the
word
until
in
6323(a)
to
accomplish
that.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
think
there's
a
regulation
specifically
on
the
point
i'm
making.
there
is,
the
regulation
does
make
clear
that
in
a
case
like
this
the
respondent
is
not
a
judgment
lien
creditor
because
in
order
to,
it
can't
take
advantage
of
the
6323(a)
exception
because
under
the
statute
you're
not
a
judgment
lien
creditor
unless,
as
this
court
has
said
repeatedly,
your
interest,
the
identity
of
the
lienholder,
the
amount
of
the
lien,
and
the
property
subject
to
the
lien
are
established
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
in
this
case
there
wasn't
a
tie.
in
this
case--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's...
well,
we
were...
no,
we
filed
later
than
they
filed,
but
as
of
the
time
we
filed
they
didn't
have
any
interest
in
this
property
at
all.
in
fact
it's
a
stronger
case
than
the
numerous
cases--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
would
be
one
way
to
put
it.
i
think
that
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
the
question
of
when
our
lien
attached
to
the
property
is
not
a
legally,
there's
nothing
that
makes
that
a
legally
significant
question.
if
it...
then
that
is
really
to
say
the
same
thing
as
the
date
of
attachment
was
as
of
the
date
that
it
was
filed,
or
in
the
case
that
didn't
come
within
one
of
the
6323(a)
exceptions
it
would
be
when
the
federal
tax
lien
arises,
which
congress
provided
was
the
date
of
assessment.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
again,
i
think
the
key
point
is
that
the
date--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
we
did,
we
attached
to
the
property
on
september
23,
1987,
on
the
same
date
as
respondent--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
that's
a
separate
question.
we,
our
lien
did
cover
real
property
as
well
as
personal
property.
it
was
the
holding
of
the
district
court
that
we
waived
our
rights
to
the
taxpayer's
personal
property.
we
think
that
was
mistaken,
but
we
didn't,
don't
challenge
that
here.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
our
lien
attached
to
the
property
on,
at
the
same
time
as
respondents',
on
september
23,
1987,
but
the
priority
of
the
federal
lien
should
be
determined
as
of
the
date
of
filing.
the
question
is
whether
as
of
the
date
we
filed,
whether
at
that
point
respondents'
lien
was
specific
and
perfected,
and
it
wasn't
in
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
i
mean,
that
would,
legally
that
would
be,
that
would
have
the
same
effect
as
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
i
think
the
federal
lien
attached
on
september
23,
1987.
i
just
don't
think
that
attachment
is
a
relevant
question
to
ask
in
determining
who
has,
attachment
of
the
federal
lien--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
i'm
comfortable
in
saying
that
on
september
23,
1987
that
was
the
date
that
the
federal
lien
attached.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
right.
but
that
the
priority
of
the
united
states,
as
is
the
case
with
many
of
the
exceptions
in
the
tax
lien
act
and
elsewhere
in
the
ucc
when
you're
dealing
with
prior,
with
private
creditors,
it
is
frequently
the
case
that
the
priority
is
not
measured
from
the
date
of
attachment
but
is
measured
from
some
other
date.
and
it's
our
position
that
under
federal
law
the
priority
is
measured
from
the
date
of
filing
in
the
6323(a)
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
have
i
used
the
word?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i've
been
trying
not
to.
thank
you.
