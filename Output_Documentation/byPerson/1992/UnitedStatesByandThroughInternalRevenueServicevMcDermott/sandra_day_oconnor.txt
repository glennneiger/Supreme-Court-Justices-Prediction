may
i
ask,
mr.
feldman,
now,
if
we
weren't
dealing
with
after-acquired
property
but
had
a
judgment
lien
on
all
property
of
the
debtor,
would
you
think
a
subsequently
filed
federal
lien
would
take
priority?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
i
thought
so
too.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
pretty
specific,
if
it
attaches
to
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
enough
that
you
can
say
it's
clear
that
any
subsequently
acquired
property
will
be
immediately
covered
by
the
judgment
lien?
and
it
is
clear
that
it
would
be,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
specificity
isn't
a
problem.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
whose
lien
attached
first
in
your
view,
or
were
they
simultaneous?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
the
statute
designed
to
protect,
reliance
interests--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
the
creditor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
does
the
creditor
have
the
judgment
lien
credit
or
have
any
reliance
interest
on
property
subsequently
acquired,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
there
had
been
no
federal
government
here
but
we
had
a
situation
of
private
parties,
what
would
be
the
result
under
the
uniform
commercial
code
of
state
law
generally
for
after-acquired
property?
