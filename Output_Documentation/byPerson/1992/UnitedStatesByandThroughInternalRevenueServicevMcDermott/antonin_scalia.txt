i
don't
know...
i
don't
see
how
the
third
requirement
is
met.
you
don't
know
what
property
it
attaches
to
until
some
property
is
after-acquired.
if
other
real
estate
had
been
acquired
it
would
have
attached
to
other
real
estate.
if
this
real
estate
had
not
been
foreclosed
upon,
this
real
estate,
it
would
not
have
attached
to
this
real
estate.
how
can
you
possibly
say
that
the
property
has
been
identified?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
all,
it
covered
all
extant
property.
if
you
ask
what
property
is
covered
you
could
have
pointed,
you
say
it's
this
property
or
this
property
or
the
other
property.
in
your
case
if
you
asked
what
real
estate
is
covered
by
this
lien
you'd
say
well,
gee,
i,
i,
it
covers
this
current
real
estate,
but
what
future
real
estate
i
can't
tell
you
until
he
acquires
it.
that's
quite
different
from
the
vermont
case,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
find,
i
find
that
not
only
not
in
accord
with
the
1966
understanding
of
congress,
but
not
in
accord
with
what
in
general
commercial
law
is
regarded
to
be
the
perfection
of
a
lien.
i
think
just
the
common
law
understanding
is
that
the
lien
doesn't
attach
until
the
property
is
identified,
and
that's
why
the
provision
of
the
uniform
commercial
code
containing
an
after-acquired
property
clause
was
a
real
innovation,
because
it
was
generally
understood
in
the
common
law
that
you
can't
attach
until
you
know
what
the
property
is.
it's
simply--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
understand,
of
course
the
ucc
applies
only
to
personal
property,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
it
made
an
innovation
with
respect
to
personal
property,
and
that
the
old
law
with
respect
to
personal
property
was
the
same
as
the
old
law
with
respect
to
real
property,
that
you
don't
have
a
perfected
lien
until
you
know
what
the
property
is.
do
you
think
in
common
law
it
was,
there
was
a
distinction
between
personal
and
real
property,
you
could
perfect
a
lien
before
you
knew
what
the
property
was?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is,
you
know
that
there
is
no
such
word
as
choate,
but
choate
is
to
inchoate
as
sult
is
to
insult.
i
mean--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
somebody
has
used
it
around
here.
i
heard
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
tenth
circuit.
the
dispute
involves
competing
priorities
of
a
federal
tax
lien
and
a
private
creditor's
judgment
lien.
the
united
states
assessed
respondents
mr.
and
mrs.
mcdermott
for
unpaid
federal
income
taxes
for
the
years
1977
through
1981.
that
assessment
automatically
created
a
lien
in
favor
of
the
united
states
upon
all
of
the
mcdermotts'
property,
both
existing
and
to
be
acquired
in
the
future.
under
25
u.s.c.
section
6323(a)
however,
this
federal
tax
lien
could
"not
be
valid
as
against
any
judgment
lien
creditor
until
notice
thereof
has
been
filed".
before
the
united
states
filed
the
lien
with
the
salt
lake
county
clerk,
a
bank
the
other
competing
lienor
here,
docketed
a
state
court
judgment
it
had
won
against
the
mcdermotts.
thereby,
creating
a
state
law
judgment
lien
on
all
of
the
mcdermotts'
existing
and
after
acquired
real
property
in
the
county.
thereafter,
the
united
states
filed
its
lien
and
later
still
the
mcdermotts
acquired
the
property
that
is
the
subject
of
this
action.
it
is
an
interpleader
action,
that
is
to
say,
a
suit
by
the
mcdermotts
against
both
the
bank
and
the
united
states
asking
the
court
to
decide
which
of
the
two
has
superior
security
rights
in
the
property.
the
district
court
awarded
priority
to
the
bank's
lien
with
the
bank
lien
and
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
priority
for
purposes
of
the
federal
law
governing
tax
liens
is
determined
by
the
common
law
principle
that
the
first
in
time
is
the
first
in
right.
a
state
created
lien
that
compete
with
a
federal
lien,
however,
is
deemed
to
be
in
existence
for
first
in
time
purposes
only
when
it
has
been
perfected
in
the
sense
that,
the
identity
of
the
lien
or
the
property
subject
to
the
lien
and
the
amount
of
lien
are
all
established.
the
bank
argued
that
its
judgment
lien
was
perfected
as
to
all
real
property
then
and
hereafter
acquired
by
the
mcdermotts
as
of
the
date
that
the
bank
docketed
its
judgment
lien.
we
reject
that
notion.
as
indicated
in
our
earlier
cases
and
as
we
think
common
usage
prescribes,
a
lien
is
not
perfected
until
it
has
actually
attached
to
identifiable
property.
the
bank's
lien
did
not
become
perfected
with
respect
to
the
property
at
issue
here
in
other
words
until
mcdermotts
acquired
that
property.
since,
that
occurred
after
filing
of
the
federal
tax
lien,
the
bank's
lien
was
not
first
in
time.
though,
the
bank's
lien
was
not
first
in
time,
the
federal
tax
lien
was
not
necessarily
first
in
time
either.
it
could
have
been
a
tie,
it
also,
was
a
lien
in
covering
after
acquired
property
and
it
also
attached
and
became
perfected
when
the
mcdermotts
acquired
the
property.
we
think
,
however,
that
under
the
language
and
section
6323(a),
the
filing
of
the
notice
renders
the
federal
tax
lien
extant
for
first
in
time
purposes
regardless
of
whether
it
has
yet
attached
to
identifiable
property.
that
reading
is
confirmed
by
the
provision,
two
subsections
later
and
section
6323(c)(1)
which,
for
reasons
too
tedious
to
describe,
reflects
the
assumption
at
the
tax
lien
once
filed
will
prevail
regardless
it
when
it
attaches.
justice
thomas
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
and
justice
o'connor
join.
