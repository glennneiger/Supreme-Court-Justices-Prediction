justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
take
the
position
that
even
if
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
arraignment
said
look,
i...
i
understand
my
right
to
be
present
at
trial
but
i
don't
want
to
be,
i
give
up
that
right
and
you
folks
go
ahead
without
me.
that's
no
good.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
the
practical
effect,
i
suppose,
if
you
are
correct
here,
is
that
more
people
ought
to
be
incarcerated
pending
trial
if
there's
a
risk
they
won't
show
up.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
see
any
constitutional
privilege
here
that
couldn't
be
waived?
i
mean
could
the
rule
be
changed
to
allow
the
court
to
do
what
it
did
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
certainly
have
said
that
a
defendant
can
waive
his
right
against
self-incrimination,
a
right
to
jury
trial,
the
right
to
have
an
attorney--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--you
think
this
is
a
right
that
is
in
that
same
league?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
a
good
many
courts
have...
have
read
the
rule
as
not
preventing
their
practice
in
accordance
with
what
was
done
here.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
seamon,
can
a
defendant
be
arraigned
in
his
absence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
how
is
that
different
from
the
requirement
for
trial?
i
mean,
it's
the
same
provision,
the
defendant
shall
be
present
at
arraignment
and
at
every
stage
of
the
trial
except
as
otherwise
provided.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
arraignment
as
well
as
trial.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
there
a
proposed
amendment
of
rule
43
at
one
time
to
deal
with
the
absence
at
the
start
of
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
happened
to
that?
