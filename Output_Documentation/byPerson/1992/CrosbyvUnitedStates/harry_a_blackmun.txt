justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
nyvold,
would
you
speak
up
just
a
little
bit.
either
that,
or
raise
the--
--there's
a
crank
at
the
right
there.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
that
doesn't
always
prevent
us
from
ruling
the
other
way.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
seamon,
have
they
ever
found
mr.
crosby?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
say
it
over
again,
i
can't
hear.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i'm
sorry.
now
do
it
a
third
time,
will
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
he
was
arrested
where?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
he
is
in
custody
now.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
if
you
lose
this
case,
apart
from
this
case,
to
what
extent
is
the
government...
government
discomforted?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
maybe
defendants
would
abscond
earlier,
hum?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
bail
would
be
higher
or
something.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
yet
here
you've
sailed
along
on
the
face
of
the
language
in
the
rule
without
any
concern,
i
guess
because
the
courts
of
appeals
have
being
going
your
way.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
comes
to
us
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
the
petitioner
crosby
failed
to
appear
at
the
beginning
of
his
federal
criminal
trial.
he
had
been
present
at
various
preliminary
proceedings.
the
district
court
permitted
the
trial
to
go
on
in
his
absence
and
he
was
convicted
and
subsequently
arrested
and
sentenced.
he
argued
that
the
trial
was
prohibited
by
rule
43
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
and
this
provides
that
a
defendant
must
be
present
at
every
trial
stage
"except
as
otherwise
provided"
by
the
rule.
the
rule,
however,
lists
situations
in
which
a
right
to
be
present
maybe
waived
including
when
a
defendant
"initially
present"
is
voluntarily
absent
thereafter.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
conviction.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
we
conclude
that
the
rule
clearly
indicates
that
the
situations
in
which
the
trial
may
proceed
without
the
defendant
is
exclusive.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
