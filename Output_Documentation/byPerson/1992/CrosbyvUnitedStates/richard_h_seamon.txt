mr.
richard
h.
seamon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
three
possible
ways
in
which
the
drafters
of
rule
43
could
have
responded
to
the
problem
of
a
criminal
defendant
who
absconded
prior
to
trial.
they
could
have
expressly
authorized
trial
in
absentia
under
those
circumstances,
could
have
expressly
prohibited
it,
or
it
could
have
left
the
matter
for
courts
to
decide.
we
think
the
drafters
took
the
third
route.
they
left
the
matters
for
the
courts
because
the
issue
had
not
been
resolved
at
the
time
the
rule
was
adopted.
since
rule
43
was
adopted,
every
court
of
appeals
that
has
considered
the
issue
has
concluded
that
a
defendant
who
deliberately
fails
to
show
up
for
his
trial
can
be
tried
in
his
absence.
we
think--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
correct.
i
would
suggest,
however,
that
the
unanimity
of
the
lower
courts
in
this
respect
casts
serious
doubt
on
the
contention
that
rule
43
has
a
plain
meaning
with
respect
to
the
question
we
have
here.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
think
that...
you're
referring
to
subsection
(a)
of
rule
43,
and
we
think
that
rule
43
means
that
in
general
the
defendant
has
both
a
right
and
a
duty
to
attend
all
of
the
criminal
proceedings
against
him.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
requires
him
to
be
present.
and
in
this
case
petitioner
breached
that
requirement.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
is
addressed
to
the
court
as
well.
the
court
has
a
responsibility
to
bring
the--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--defendant
before
the
court
if
it
is
possible
to
do
so.
in
this
case
there
was
no
ability--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--to
do
that.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
it
requires
the
defendant's
presence.
but
what
43(a)
does
not
do
is
address
what
options
are
open
to
a...
to
the
court
when
the
defendant
skips...
skips
bond
the
night
before
trial
as
petitioner
did
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
the
exceptions
in
the
rule
address
situations
in
which
the...
a
criminal
defendant
does
not
have
a
duty
to
appear
before
trial,
and
it
also
addresses
a
couple
of
situations
in
which
a
defendant
gives
up
the
right
to
attend.
but
what
rule
43(a)
doesn't
do
is
address
what
options
are
open
to
the
court
when
the
criminal
defendant
simply
cannot
be
brought
before
the
court.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
the--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that
proviso--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--well,
that's...
that's
the
part
of
the
rule
that
has
to
be
read
in
by
negative
implication,
that
the
trial
should
not
go
forward.
but
nothing...
and
no
wording
of
that
sort
is
in
rule
43(a).
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
what
it
doesn't
say
is
or
else
the
trial
may
not
go
forward.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
well,
we--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
right.
and
the
shall
be
present
language
does
a
couple
of
things.
it...
it
certainly
imposes
a
duty
on
the
court
to
ensure
his
presence,
and
it
certainly
also
imposes
an
obligation
on
the
defendant
to
show
up.
but
what
it
doesn't
do,
in
our
position,
is
address
what
happens
when
he
doesn't.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it's...
well,
that's
right.
43(b)
specifies
two
examples
in
which
a
defendant
gives
up
the
right
to
be
present.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
do
give
effect
to
that
language.
what
we
say
is
that
subsection
(a)
of
rule
43
sets
up
the
general
requirement
of
the
defendant's
presence.
there
are
certain
circumstances,
namely
specified
in
subsections
(b)
and
(c),
in
which
the
defendant's
presence
is
not
required
or
the
defendant,
having
the
right,
loses
that
right
through
misconduct.
but
besides
setting
forth
that
general
requirement
of
presence,
rule
43(a),
in
our
view,
does
not
specify
that
the
trial
should
not
go
forward
if
the
defendant
isn't
present.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
if
that
except
as
phrase
were
missing
from
43(a),
there
could
be
questions
concerning
conflicts
between
subsection
(a)
and
subsection
(c).
for
example,
under...
under
subsection
(c)
it
says
that
the
defendant's
presence
is
not
required
at
a
conference
or
argument
under
a
question
of
law.
if
the
except
as
otherwise
provided
clause
were
not
in
43(a),
a
question
could
arise
whether,
in
fact,
the
defendant
was
required
to
be
present
at
such
conferences
if
they
took
place
during
the
trial.
43(a)
lays
down
a
blanket
rule
of
presence,
but
it
also
recognizes
that
there
are
certain
circumstances
in
which
the
defendant
does
not
have
an
obligation
to
be
present
during
the
trial,
and
some
of
those
examples
are
set
forth
in
subsection
(c).
and
there
are
also
cases
in
which
the
defendant
loses
the
right
to
be
present
and
they
are
set
forth
in
subsection
(b).
subsection
(a)
sets
forth
a
general
requirement--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
what
rule
43(b)
does
is
it
addresses
two
specific
factual
situations
in...
in...
and
then
specifies
what
the
court's
options
are
in
those
situations.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
wouldn't
have
to
be
addressed,
but
the
reason
it
was
when
rule
43
was
adopted
was
because
this
court
had
addressed
those
situations.
43(b)(1)
had
been
addressed
in
diaz
v.
united
states,
and
then
subsequently
the
situation
described
in
rule
43(b)(2)
was
addressed
in
illinois
v.
allen.
so
the...
the...
but
the
rule
that
was--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that
situation--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
illinois
v.
allen
was
a
state
case
and
it
was
a
constitutional
question
of
whether
the--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
right.
illinois
was
a
state
case
and
it
wasn't
governed
by
the
rules.
and,
in
fact,
the
rule
was
amended
to
apply
the
illinois
v.
allen
exception
to
federal
courts.
and,
actually,
that
addition
to
the
rule,
which
occurred
in
1974,
is
significant
because
the
drafters
described
the
addition
permitting
the
exclusion
of
disruptive
defendants
as
designed
to,
quote,
make
clear
that
federal
courts,
as
well
as
state
courts,
had
the
power
to
exclude
disruptive
defendants
from
the
courtroom.
we
think
it's
significant
that
they
described
the
amendment
as
clarifying
a
preexisting
power,
rather
than
creating
a
new
one,
because
prior
to
the
1974
amendment
the
rule
didn't
expressly
authorize
federal
courts
to
exclude
disruptive
defendants.
nonetheless,
the
drafters,
in
adding
the
'74
amendment,
plainly
did
not
see
rule
43's
prior
silence
on
that
question
as
creating
a
prohibition.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
in...
in
the...
the
defendant's
presence
is
required
at
arraignment
under
rule
43(a).
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
and
we
would
say
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
a
defendant
can
waive
the
right
to
be
present
at
arraignment.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
correct
as
well.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
now,
what
would
prevent
the
judge
from
doing
that
are
the
principles
enunciated
in
this
court's
decisions
concerning
waiver
of
the
right
to
be
present,
and
as
well
as--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it
would
be
a
decent
waiver,
but
the
question
would
still
remain
whether
the
trial
court
should
accept
that
waiver
and
say
we'll
go
forward
in
the
defendant's
absence.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
it
does
require
the
defendant
to
be
present.
rule
43(a)
does
lay
a--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
read
it
as,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
was
addressed
to
petitioner
and...
and
he
violated
his
duty
to
show
up.
it
is
addressed,
as
well,
to
whoever
has
custody
of
the
defendant,
and
it's
certainly
addressed
to
the
court
as
well.
but
in
this
case
the...
the
violation
of
the
right...
of
the
duty
to
be
present
was
the
petitioner's
and
not
the
court's.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
no.
there
are...
there
are...
certainly
the
conditions
under
which
detention
and
appearance
bond...
detention
hearings
are
held
and
appearance
bonds
are
executed.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
and
there
are
all--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--it
serves
an
important
purpose.
it
restates
what
rule...
what
the
law
was
at
the
time
the
rule
was
adopted,
which
is
that,
in
general,
the
defendant
shall
be
present
throughout
the
proceedings
against
him.
and
it's
very
clear,
though,
that
at
the
time
rule
43
was
adopted
the
right
of
presence
could
be
waived;
this
court
had
established
that
in
diaz.
it
was
not
clear
whether
the
right
could
be
waived
by
the
defendant's
absconding
prior
to
trial,
and
our
position
is
that
the
drafters
simply
left
that
for
courts
to
decide.
it
hadn't
been
resolved
at
the
time
the
rule
was
adopted.
it
was
an
open
question,
certainly
not
an
insignificant
question,
but
nonetheless
one
that
had
not
been
dealt
with
at
that
time,
and
has
yet
to
be.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it's...
it
is
correct
that
diaz's
description
of
the
prevailing
rule
at
that
time
suggests
that.
and
for
that
matter,
diaz
also
suggested
that
in
noncapital
cases...
it
was
only
in
noncapital
cases
that
a
defendant's
absconding
during
trial
could
permit
the
trial
to
go
forward.
but
the...
the
law
has
been
evolving
on
that
point,
and
to
come
to
back
to
the...
the
question
of...
of
a
capital...
a
defendant
charged
with
a
capital
offense,
in
1974
the
rule
was
amended
to
drop
the
wording
regarding
capital
offenses
so
that
courts
would
have
the
opportunity
to
address
the
issue
of
whether
a
defendant
charged
with
a
capital
offense
can
waive
the
right
to
be
present
at
his
trial.
my
point
is
that
the
drafters
have
generally
not
anticipated
issues
that
have
not
been
resolved
by
the
courts.
and
one
of
those
issues
is
the
status
of
a
defendant
charged
with
a
capital
offense,
and
another
of
those
issues
is
the
question
of
a
defendant
who
absconds
prior
to
trial.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
there
was.
in
1973
the
advisory
committee
proposed
an
amendment
that...
that
would
have
permitted
that.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
was...
it
was
never
passed.
and
the
reasons
why--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--are
unclear.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it
was
never
adopted
by
the
advisory
committee
on
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
nor
presented
to
this
court.
and
although
we've
diligently
researched
the
history
of
that,
it
simply
is
unclear
what...
why
the
advisory
committee
decided
not
to
adopt
it.
we
tend
to
think,
in
light
of
the
rest
of
the
history
of
the
rule,
that
this
was
yet
another
situation
in
which
the
drafters
did
not
decide
to
decide
an
issue
that
had
not
yet
been
passed
upon
by
the
courts.
around
the
time
that
this
proposal
i
was
just
speaking
of
came
up,
this
court
had
granted
cert
in
tacon
v.
arizona
to
address
the
question
of
whether
a
defendant
could
waive
the
right
to
be
present...
as
a
constitutional
matter,
could
waive
the
right
to
be
present
at
trial
at
all.
but
cert
was
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted,
and
so
the
issue
was...
was
not
resolved,
although
i
would
suggest
that
the
drafters
anticipated
that
this
court's
resolution
of
that
issue
may
have
obviated
the
need
for...
for
the
amendment
that
you're
speaking
of.
the...
i'd
like
to
return
to
the
lower
courts,
because
ever
since
rule
43
was
adopted
the
lower
courts
have
unanimously
held
that
waiver
is
appropriate
in
these
situations
if
the
public
interest
in
proceeding
with
the
trial
outweighs
the
defendant's
interest
in
being
present.
those
decisions
are
significant
in
two
respects.
first
at
all...
first
of
all,
they
cast
serious
doubt
on
petitioner's
contention
that
the
plain
language
of
rule
43
supports
his
reading.
now,
if
the
language
were
so
plain,
so
many
federal
courts
of
appeals
would
not
have
decided
the
question
against
him.
and
secondly,
all
of
the
court
of
appeals
decisions
have
been
grounded
on
common
reasoning,
which
simply
is...
is
that
just
as
a
defendant
may
waive
his
right
to
be
present
at
trial
by
absconding
once
the
trial
begins,
he
may
also
waive
the
right
by...
by
absconding
before
the
trial
begins.
that
approach
fully
protects
the
defendant's
right
to
be
present
by
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
show
up,
but
at
the
same
time
it
prevents
the
sort
of
calculated
manipulation
of
the
judicial
system
that's
involved
in
this
case.
the
lower
courts
take
a
two-part
inquiry.
the
first
is
directed
to
whether
the
defendant's
absence
is,
in
fact,
knowing
and
voluntary.
once
that's
determined,
it
does
not
mean
that
the...
that
automatically
trial
in
absentia
goes
forward.
instead,
the
courts
have
gone
on
to
determine
whether
the
public
interest
in
proceeding
outweighs
the
defendant's
interest
in
being
present.
in
fact,
the
decisions
in
this
case
below
illustrate
the
care
with
which
the
lower
courts
have
approached
this
issue.
the
trial
court
judge
was
faced
with
a
very
difficult
situation
on
the
morning
of
october
12,
1988
when
this
trial
was
scheduled
to
go
forward.
petitioner's
three
codefendants
were
present,
as
were
their
counsel,
the
government
had
assembled
dozens...
over
80
witnesses
to
testify
and
hundreds
of
proposed
exhibits.
in
short,
everything
was
waiting
to
go
forward,
including
the
selection
of
potential
jurors,
except
the
petitioner
wasn't
there.
nonetheless,
the
trial
went--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--but
our
argument
would
have
less
force
in
that
situation
because
postponing
the
trial--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--certainly,
sir.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we've...
we've
been
very
successful
with
the
argument.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
that's
right.
and
my
only
point
is
that
this...
that
if...
if
waiver
of
the
right
to
be
present
and
a
continuation
of
the
trial
in
a
defendant's
absence
was
ever
proper,
this
is
a
case
in
which
it
was.
the
case
was
expected...
the
trial
was
expected
and,
in
fact,
did
last
about
4
weeks.
there
were
hundreds
of
exhibits
and
dozens
of
witnesses
that
had
come
from
all
over
the
country,
and
several
had
come
from
canada.
nonetheless,
the
trial
court
put
everything
on
hold
and
waited
5
days,
in
the
meantime
making
substantial
inquiries
into
finding
out
where
petitioner
was,
and
there
was
no
indication
that
he
was
ever
going
to
show
up.
in
fact,
apparently
the
marshals
had
been
told
that
he
was
packing
the
trunk
of
his
car
the
night
before
trial
begin
and
was
never
seen
from
again.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
it...
it
certainly
is
different.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
obviously...
and,
certainly,
the
government
prefers
to
try
defendants
in
their...
in
their
presence,
and
it...
it
imposes
a
great
burden
on
everyone,
no
matter
what
a
court
ultimately
decides
to
do,
when
a
defendant
is
absent.
again,
as
in
this
case,
the
marshals
had
to
be
dispatched,
a
bond
forfeiture
hearing
had
to
be
undertaken,
inquiries
were
made
of
petitioner's
family
and
his
bondsman.
and
then,
still,
the
question
had
to
be
decided
what
to
do.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
believe
so.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
eight
circuits.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
well,
we...
we
didn't
think
the
rule
needs
fixing,
and
neither
have
any
of
the
courts
of
appeal.
those
courts
have
concluded,
as
we
argue,
that--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--well,
that's
right.
and,
actually,
it...
that
is
significant,
because
it
brings
up
the
question
that
petitioner's
suggested
of
the
specter
of
lots
of
defendants
being...
or
defendants
being
deprived--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--they
did
find
mr.
crosby.
he
was...
he
was
arrested
approximately
8
month
after...
8
months
after
his
trial
was
scheduled.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
he
was
arrested
about
8
months
after
his
trial
was
scheduled
to
begin.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
he
was
arrested
in
florida
about
8
months
after
the
trial
started.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
he
is
in
custody
now,
and
he
was
sentenced
upon
his
return.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
well,
significantly.
i
mean,
obviously,
the
government
would
go
forward
and
ask
for
an
explicit
amendment
to
the
rule
to
address
this
situation.
but
we...
we
don't
think
it's
necessary,
because
we
think
that
the
courts
of
appeal
have
correctly
decided
that
trial
in
absentia,
under
these
circumstances,
is
correct.
it
would
impose...
in
the
meantime,
it
would
impose
a
significant
burden
because
the
position
for
which
petitioner
is
contending
actually
gives
defendants
who
are
contemplating
flight
an
incentive
to
skip
before
the
trial
ever
gets
started.
and--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--some
do.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
some
do
and
the...
the
enhanced
risk
that
defendants
would
flee
before
their
trial
would
tend
to...
to
have
the
government
argue
in
favor
of
pretrial
detention
in
more
cases,
and
may
well
dispose
courts
to
grant
those...
those
requests.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
the
courts
of
appeal
have
consistently
gone
our
way
since
the
rule
was
adopted,
and...
and--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--we...
we
don't
think
that
that's
a
tenable
argument.
we
think
that...
that
the
trial
begins
with
the
empaneling
of
the...
of
the
jury,
as
this
court
has
held
and
continues
through--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that
much
is
clear
on
the
face
of
rule
43.
i
would
concede
that.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
most
state
courts
have
rules
very
similar
to
rule
43.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
in
facts
like
this,
the
majority
of
them...
although
not
all
of
them...
do
the
same
thing
that
the
eighth
circuit
did
here,
which
is
to
first
make
an
inquiry
to
determine
if
the
defendant
really
has
absconded
and
is
voluntarily
away
and
the,
as
a
second
point,
looking
to
whether,
in
fact,
the
trial
can
be
postponed
or
rescheduled
or
it
needs
to
go
forward
because
of
the
witnesses
or
because
of
codefendants,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
if
there
are
no
other
questions.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
thank
you.
