what
effect
do
you
give
to
the
words
except
as
otherwise
provided?
i
take
it
your
argument
is
that
rule
43(b)
simply
gives
examples
of
instances
where
the
rule
would
be
inapplicable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
could
make
that
argument
if
the
phrase,
except
as
otherwise
provided
by
this
rule
is
not
present.
so,
then,
i
take
it
you
give
no
effect
at
all
to
that
language?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
point
is
i
take
it
you
could
make
precisely
the
same
argument
if
the
words
except
as
otherwise
provided
were
absent
from
subsection
(a).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
that
without
the
rule,
the
judge
could...
was...
is
without
power
to
require
the
defendant
to
be
present
at
all
stages
of
the
trial,
subject
to
the
penalty
of
contempt?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
order
to
appear
subject
to
contempt.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
the
rule
doesn't
really
serve
a
very
important
purpose
at
all
insofar
as
it's
directed
to
the
defendant,
does
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but,
in
fairness,
the
government
goes
on
to
say:
but
the
cases
indicate
you
can
proceed
against
him
in
his
absence
even
if
he's
not
there
at
the
outset
of
the
trial.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
assume
the
government
was
saying
that
this
is
the
way
the
rule
has
been
interpreted
by
the
courts.
