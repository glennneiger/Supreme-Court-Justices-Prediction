justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
nyvold,
i...
am
i
correct
that
(b)(2),
subsection
(b)(2)
of
rule
43
was
later
added?
am
i
right
about
that?
that
said...
the
one
that
makes
an
exception
for
after
being
warned
by
the
court
that
disruptive
conduct
will
cause
removal,
he
persists
in
conduct
which
is
such
as
to
justify
exclusion
from
the
courtroom.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
a
later
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
could
we
have
decided
illinois
v.
allen?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
old
rule
that
didn't
have
that
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
say
that
making
a
fuss
at
trial
is
being
voluntarily
absent.
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
if
you
want
to.
i
don't
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
i
think...
i
think
that...
i
mean
i
have
a
problem
with
that
as
far
as
your
case
goes.
it
seems
to
me
that
if...
if
you
think
that
illinois
v.
allen
was
rightly
decided,
you...
you
acknowledge
that
the
rule
is
not
exclusive
and
that
there
are
some
other
reasons
why
you
may
allow
the
trial
to
proceed
without
the
defendant.
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
say
that
someone
is
voluntarily
absent
if
he
disrupts
the
trial,
and
is
therefore,
you
know,
required
to
leave.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there...
there
was
no
inconvenience
involved
in
deferring
the
sentencing
since
the
sentence
couldn't
be
executed
until
they
caught
him
anyway.
you
may
as
well
wait
until
you
catch
him
to
determine
the
sentence
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
there
was
a
lot
of
inconvenience
in
rescheduling
the
whole
trial
just
because
he
took
off
after...
right?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
witnesses
were
ready
to
go
and
he
was
expected
to
be
there
and
he
just
never
showed
up
for
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
it...
all
i'm
saying
is
that
there
was
some
logic
to
the
fact
that
the
court
in
this
case
required
him
to
be
present
for
the
sentencing,
did
not
impose
the
sentence
without
his
presence.
there
was
some
reason
for
making
a
distinction.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it's
not
a
reason
permitted
by
the
rule.
that
may
well
be,
but
there
was
a
logical
reason
for
it
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
i
don't
understand,
mr.
seamon,
is
this.
central
to
your
argument
as
you
made
it
is
that...
is
that
(a)
does
not
address,
does
not
address
what
happens
if
the
defendant
is
not
present.
it
does
not
say
anything
about
whether
the
trial
shall
proceed,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
so,
then
why
is
(b)
even
necessary?
why
do
you
have
to
make
an
exception?
i
mean
if
(a)
doesn't
address
it,
why
do
you
then
go
on
to
say
in
(b),
however,
the
trial
may
proceed
if
the
defendant
is
voluntarily
absent.
you
wouldn't
go
ahead
with
(b).
(b)
would
not
have
existed
if
(a)
didn't
address
that
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
wouldn't
have
to
be
addressed
if
the...
if
the
prohibition
of
(a)
did
not
apply
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
plain
meaning,
i
guess,
right.
pretrial
means
pretrial,
yeah.
[laughter]
