justice
byron
r.
white
this
doesn't
even...
even
speak
to
the
situation
here,
and
i
gather
you're
saying
that
it's
just
like
the
rule
just
doesn't
speak
to
a
disruptive
defendant.
justice
byron
r.
white
--over
themselves.
over
themselves.
i
guess
the
rule...
the
rule
now
says
shall,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
committee
was
just...
perhaps,
just
paying
some
respect
to
diaz.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
at
verdict,
or
at
sentencing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
you
parse
down
a
rule
that
says
shall
be
present
at
every
stage
of
the
trial
except
as
hereafter
provided?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
says
shall
be
present.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
his
right.
it
says,
that
he
shall
be
present.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
requires.
isn't
it
addressed
to
the
court
too,
he
shall
be
present?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
say
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
say
that,
if
possible
to
do
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
says
shall
be
present
except
as
is
provided
elsewhere
in
the
rule.
and
the
exception
certainly
doesn't
cover
his
absence
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i...
arguably,
it...
it...
it
deals
with
it
expressly.
you
don't
go
forward
with
the
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
--was
addressed
in
illinois
against
allen?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
a
state
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
only
thing
that
was
at
issue
was
the...
was
the
constitution.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
didn't
address
it...
address
the
rule
then.
they
just
had
it...
they
just
recited
it
in
a
footnote.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what...
what's
your
answer?
the
rule
just
doesn't
speak
to
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't
say...
it
doesn't
say
what
happens
if
he
isn't
present.
justice
byron
r.
white
by
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
by
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yeah,
but
you
would
be...
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
if
there
was
just
a
single
witness.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you're
making
the
argument
and
you
think
you
should
win
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
like,
apparently,
the
government
has
won
in
every
case
where...
in
the
case...
when
the
issue
has
come
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
doubt
very
much
if
there
were
100
witnesses
in
all
those
cases.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
has
the...
the
government
always
has
a...
or
the
justice
department
always
has
a
representative
on
the
advisory
committee,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
if
these
cases
kept
coming
up
and
they're...
how
many
courts
of
appeals
have
held
in
your
favor?
justice
byron
r.
white
eight
circuits.
well,
so
it's
sort
of
a
repetitive
sort
of
a
situation,
and
it
looks
to
me
like
you
would
have
prevailed
upon
the
advisory
committee
to
change
the
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
not
have
needed
fixing
except
that
all
the
courts
of
appeals
haven't
ruled
on
it
yet,
but
i...
i...
i
would
almost
bet
that
sooner
or
later
they
would
have
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
might
even
be
easier
for
you
to
argue
that...
that
a
pretrial
conference
is
part
of
the
trial
and
he
was
present
at
the
pretrial
conference.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
understand.
what...
what...
what...
how
did
they...
what
reason
did
they
give
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
was...
but
he
did...
he
did
point
out
that
apparently
the
courts
of
appeals
knew
more
about
the
rule
than
he
did.
