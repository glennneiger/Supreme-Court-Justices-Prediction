chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
91-6194,
michael
crosby
against
the
united
states.
mr.
nyvold,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
the
advisory
committee
notes
be
conclusive?
i
mean
it's
this
court
that
adopts
the
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you...
that's
all
perfectly
legitimate
argument,
but
you
said
the
advisory
committee
notes
are
conclusive.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
it
a
situation
we
want
to
bring
about
if
we
have
any
choice
in
the
matter?
i
mean,
doesn't
it
seem
odd
that...
that
the
rule
would
call
for
such
a
result?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
well,
i
wonder
if
we
should
bring
to
the
interpretation
of
a
rule
adopted
by
a
rules
committee
and
forwarded
to
this
court
and
ultimately
put
to
congress
exactly
the
same
sort
of
construction
materials
as
we
bring
to
a
statute.
it
seems
to
me
here
you...
you...
you...
that
it's
perfectly
permissible
for
us
to
inquire,
if
this
wasn't
the
common
law
rule,
why
on
earth
did
the
rule
change
it,
as
it
appears
to
have
done.
and
perhaps
we
would
determine
that
maybe
it
didn't
change
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said...
well,
then,
you
and
the
government
disagree
on
that.
am
i
not
right,
from
your
briefs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
was
the
situation
at
common
law
before
there
was...
or,
say,
in
this
country,
before
the
rule
was
adopted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the...
the...
the
comment
went
further
than
the
actual
rule
did
itself.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
may
reflect
on
the
competence
of
the
advisory
committee.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
the...
the...
diaz
didn't
deal
with
a
situation
where
the
defendant
was
not
present
at
the
beginning
of
his
trial,
did
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
surely
more
than
just
inconvenience,
if...
if
the
government
has
a
bunch
of
witnesses
put
together,
it's
a
very
frustrating
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so...
so
these
frustrations
can
continue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
nyvold.
mr.
seamon,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
read
it
as
kind
of
addressed
to
the
bailiff.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
language
in
the
diaz
opinion,
albeit
dicta,
that
suggests
that
our
court
was
of
the
view
that
the
common
law
thought
that
a
defendant
could
not
waive
his
presence
at
the
beginning
of
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
seamon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nyvold,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
arraignment,
though...
if
the
defendant
absconds
before
he's
arraigned,
the
state
has
not
marshaled
the
witnesses
and
that
sort
of
thing
for
the
arraignment
the
way
they
would
have
for
the
trial,
so
the...
the
amount
of
inconvenience
is
considerably
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nyvold.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
91-6194,
crosby
against
the
united
states
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
