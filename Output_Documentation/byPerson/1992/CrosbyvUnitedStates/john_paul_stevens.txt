justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says
there
are
no
options.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
no
options,
that's
what
it
says,
shall
be
required.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
sure
is.
the
defendant
shall
be
present
at
every
stage
of
the
trial,
and
then
it
has
exceptions
later,
and
you
admitted
it
doesn't
come
with
any...
any
of
the
exceptions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
says...
but
if
he's
not
present,
obviously
it
can't
go
forward
if
he's
required
to
be
present
at
the
commencement
of
the
trial.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
also
doesn't
say
he
can't
shoot
the
judge.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
you
go
farther
than
that,
if
i
understand
it.
you
say
the
rule
simply
doesn't
address
the
problem
of
what
happens
if
he's
not
present.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
would
mean
that,
apart
from
the
constitution
and
the
common
law,
the
judge
could
just
do
anything
he
wanted.
he'd
say,
well,
he's
not
here
but
i
think
i'll
take
the
guilty
plea
anyway
from
his
sister,
or
something
like
that,
or
not
guilty
plea.
[laughter]
what
would
prevent
the
judge
from
doing
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
what
if
he
does...
there's
nothing
here
that
says
he
must
waive,
so
he
just
doesn't
show
up
without
waiving.
the
rule
doesn't
address
the
situation,
in
your
view.
it
doesn't
require
that
the
right
be
waived.
maybe
the
constitution
does
and
common
law
does,
but
the
rule,
under
your
reading,
doesn't.
it
just
doesn't
tell
the
judge
what
to
do.
he
can
take
the
plea
from
his
sister.
and
so
if
his
lawyer
shows
up
at
arraignment
and
he
gives
in
a
letter
to
the
judge
and
there's
no
question
that
he
wrote
it
and
that
he...
he
goes
and
he
says
i
know
that
if
i
were
here
at
arraignment,
here's
what
you
would
tell
me,
and
all
that,
and
i
don't
want
to
be
there.
and
you
would
say
that
would
be
a
decent
waiver,
yes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
in
at
least
one
of
those
cases
from
the
other
circuits,
isn't
it
a
fact
that
the...
although
the
defendant
was
not
there
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
trial,
he
was
there
for
most
of
the
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
makes
it...
it's
a
little
different
situation,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
seamon,
do
you
happen
to
know...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
this...
what
the
practice
in
most
state
courts
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
they
do
when
the...
in
facts
like
this,
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
