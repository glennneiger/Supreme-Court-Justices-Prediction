mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
an
obvious
clear-cut
violation
of
rule
43.
that
the
violation
is
an
obvious
one
comes
from
the
plain
wording
of
rule
43.
the
rule
requires
that
a
defendant
be
present
at
the
beginning
of
his
trial
and
prohibits
the
trial
in
absentia
of
a
defendant
who's
not
initially
present.
if
the
plain
language
weren't
enough
the--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--thank
you.
the
advisory
committee
notes
are
conclusive
as
to
what
rule
43
means,
even
if
the
plain
language
weren't
i'd
like
to--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--that's
true.
but
the
government
is
saying
that
rule
43(a)
does
not
address
the
situation
of
a
defendant
who's
not
present
for
the
beginning
of
his
trial,
and
the
advisory
committee
notes
are
helpful
in
showing
that
the
situation
of
a
defendant
not
initially
present
was
contemplated
by
the
drafters
of
the
rules
and
that
the
rule
was
intended
to
address
that.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
i
think...
i'm
sorry,
i
think
i
used
too
strong
a
word.
the
advisory...
the
rule,
the
plain
wording
in
the
rule,
obviously,
is
conclusive,
first
of
all
because
it's
not
ambiguous,
it's
clear
on
its
face.
but
since
the
government
is
saying
the
plain
wording
of
the
rule
doesn't
control
this
situation,
it
is
helpful
to
look
at
what
the
advisory
committee
said.
first
of
all,
the
advisory
committee
notes
that
are
appended
to
the
rule
specifically
speak
of
the
defendant's...
the
defendant's
presence
being
a
necessity.
rule
4...
the
advisory
committee
note
to
rule
43(b)
says
that
a
defendant
may
be
tried
only
if
he...
if
he
leaves
after
the
trial
beings,
and
cites
the
diaz
case.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
that's
not
sufficient
for
two
reasons,
or
for
one
reason,
that
he's
not
initially
present.
the
judge
at
that
point
would
have
to
take
action
to
ensure
that
that
defendant
appeared
at
trial
and
waived
that
right
after
the
trial
began.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
exactly.
that
is
one
option
available
to
the
court.
and
now,
since
the
bail
reform
act,
the...
at
least
the
federal
courts
can
incarcerate
defendants
who
pose
a
flight
risk.
and
a
defendant
who
makes
a
statement
indicating
that
he
or
she
will
not
abide
by
the
conditions
of
her
release
and
appear
for
trial
could
then
be...
have
her...
his
or
her
bail
revoked
and
be
detained.
so
there
are
means
to
deal
with
this
situation,
and--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--that
it
would
permit
a
defendant
who
didn't
appear
to
put
off
the
date
of
his
trial?
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
that
is
the
result
that
the
common
law
permitted,
and
it's
obvious
that
rule
43
adopts
the
common
law
rule
in
toto.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
oh,
certainly
the
rule
did
not
change
the
common
law
rule.
it
adopted
it
entirely.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
the
government
says
that
rule
43
doesn't
address
the
situation
of
a
defendant
not
initially
present.
it...
the
rule
obviously
does,
and
it's
the
advisory
committee
notes
that
are
helpful
in
determining
what
it
was
the
drafters
of
the
rule
wanted
the
rule
to
cover.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
a
defendant
could
be
tried
in
his
absence
only
if
he
initially
appeared
at
the
trial.
the
common
law
did
not
contemplate
the
trial
of
a
defendant
who
did
not
appear,
as...
even
though
it
was
obvious
that
such
a
defendant
might
be
putting
off
the
date
of
his
trial,
might
be
frustrating
justice,
might
be
flaunting
justice.
it
simply
was
not
contemplated
that
that
was
done.
and,
in
fact,
the
government
has
not
cited
one
case
prior
to
rule
43
in
which
the
common
law
dealt
with
a
defendant
who
absconded
prior
to
trial,
was
then
tried,
and
that
that...
and
that
result
was
affirmed
on
appeal.
there
are
no
cases,
and
the
case
cited
in
the
government's
brief,
commonwealth
v.
felton,
a
pennsylvania
case,
says
just
that,
there
are
no
cases
prior
to
rule
43
which
permit
a
trial
in
absentia
of
a
defendant
not
initially
present.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
that
was
added,
yes,
sir.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
in
response
to
illinois
v.
allen,
which
allows
a...
the
disruptive
defendant
to
be
removed
from
the
courtroom
after
being
warned.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
illinois
v.
allen
was
certainly
within...
or
the
result
in
that
case,
that
the
defendant
who
departs
or
who
is
disruptive
can
be
removed,
that
result
was
clearly
within
the
contemplation
of
the
rule,
and
here's
why.
the
rule--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--the
old...
the
old...
the
old
rule.
and
the
old
rule
read
that
a
defendant
who
voluntarily
absents
himself
after
the
trial
commences
can
be
tried
in...
in
his
absence.
and,
obviously,
it
doesn't
take
a
great
leap
of
logic
or
common
sense
to
find
that
the
disruptive--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--well,
the
disruptive
defendant
can
be
equated
to
someone
who
is
voluntarily
absent.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
well,
as
it's...
it's
not
difficult
to,
or
it's
certainly
within
the
scope
of
the
language
to
conclude
that--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--functionally,
that's
the
equivalent
of
being
voluntarily
absent.
if
one
makes
the
trial
impossible
to
proceed,
a
decision
has
to
be
made.
either
we're
going
to
remove
this
defendant
or
we're
going
to
continue
with
him,
and
the
trial
obviously
can't
continue
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
my
point
is
that
the
rule,
as
it
was
previously
written,
permitted
the
result
in
illinois
v.
allen.
here,
we
don't
have
anything
like
that.
we
have...
we
would
have
to
basically
engraft
an
exception
onto
rule
43
that
was
not
within
the
contemplation
of
the
drafters.
the
reason
that
rule
43
wasn't...
or
was
intended
to
address
the
situation
of
the
defendant
not
initially
present
is
obvious
from
the
notes
appended
to
the
first
draft
of
rule
43,
and
this
was
in
1943,
in
which
the
initial
draft
read
that
a
defendant
has
the
right
to
be
present
at
arraignment.
and
the
government
says,
well,
later
that
was
changed
to
shall
be
present,
and
the
reason
it
was
changed
to
shall
be
present
was
just
to
avoid
a
defendant
from
exercising
a
right
of...
his
right
of
presence
by
not
attending,
by
opting
not
to
attend.
and
it
appears
that
the
present
version
of
the
rule,
the
one
that
says
the
defendant
shall
be
present,
was
proposed
by
judge
sanborn
of
the
eighth
circuit,
and
this
was
in
1943.
and
his
notes
or
his
version
of
rule
43
has
appended
to
it
his
own
comment,
which
is
that,
quote:
i
think
it
would
be
inadvisable
to
conduct
criminal
trials
in
the
absence
of
the
defendant.
that
has
never
been
the
practice,
and
whether
the
defendant
wants
to
attend
the
trial
or
not,
i
think
he
should
be
compelled
to
be
present.
if,
during
trial,
he
disappears,
there
is,
of
course,
no
reason
why
he
should...
the
trial
should
not
proceed
without
him.
so
this
is
the
person
who
proposed,
apparently,
the
draft
that
we
have
right
now.
and
that
person,
judge
sanborn,
obviously
didn't
feel
that
the
common
law
permitted
the
trial
in
absentia
of
a
defendant
who
wasn't
present.
and
if
you
look
at
the
first
advisory
committee
note
appended
to
the
first
draft
of
rule
43,
that...
and
this
is
the
draft
that
says
the
defendant
simply
has
a
right
to
be
present,
it
doesn't
say
he
shall
be
present.
this
is
the
very
first
advisory
committee
draft
and
it
says:
the
second
sentence
permits
continuing
with
the
trial
in
a
felony
case
not
punishable
by
death
or
in
a
misdemeanor
case
when
the
defendant,
by
his
voluntary
act,
absents
himself
after
the
commencement
of
trial.
under
this
provision
the
defendant
is
required
to
be
present
at
arraignment,
at
plea,
and
the
trial
must
begin
in
his
presence.
so
the
first
published
draft
of
rule
43
had
that
appended
to
it.
it
was
obvious--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--at
that
time,
yes.
but
that's
significant
because
it
shows
that
even
though
the
rule
didn't
make
it
explicit,
at
least
at
that
time,
that
the
defendant
had
to
be
present,
the
advisory
committee
note
said
that
the
defendant
must...
or
the
trial
must
begin
in
the
defendant's
presence.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
well,
they...
they
were
citing
the
diaz
case,
though,
in
connection
with
that.
immediately
after
that
sentence--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--the--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--it
says
shall.
the
government
says
that
the...
the
right
to
be
present
versus
shall
be
present
is
indicative
only
of
an
attempt
to
prevent
a
defendant
from
exercising
his
right
of
presence
by
not
attending.
but
it's...
the
point
i'm
making
here
is
that
the
person
who...
judge
sanborn
who
proposed
the
present
draft
or
the
present
wording
of
the
rule,
when
he
did
that,
included
that
language,
which
was
that
it
is
inadvisable
to
conduct
criminal
trials
in
the
absence
of
the
defendant,
and
that
has
never
been
the
practice.
so
the
judge
who's
proposing
that
language
is
saying
we
just
don't
try
defendants
in
their
absence,
and
it's
obvious
what
the
committee
was...
its
intent
or
its
view
of
the
law
was
at
the
time
it
proposed...
proposed
this
rule.
if
one
looks
at
what...
well,
not
only...
staying
with
the
drafting
history
for
a
moment.
the
government's
brief
cites
at
page
19,
note
6,
a
proposed
amendment
to
the
draft
or
to
rule
43,
a
1973
proposed
amendment.
that
amendment
would
have
covered
the
situation
we
have
here
where
a
defendant
does
not
appear
for
the
beginning
of
his
trial,
and
that
amendment
would
have
permitted
the
trial
to
proceed
in
that
defendant's
absence.
the
significance
of
that
is
that
the
rule...
if
the
rule
did
not...
if
the
rule
permitted
that,
it
wouldn't
have
been
necessary
to
add
that
language.
and
the
fact
that
the
committee
rejected
it
shows
that
the
committee
didn't
want
the
rule
to
permit
the
trial
in
absentia
of
a
defendant
who
wasn't
present.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
well,
and
well
it
should,
because
the
rule
incorporated
the
common
law
rule
as
stated
in
da...
diaz,
and
that
is
what's
controlling
here.
that's
since
we
don't,
at
common
law,
try
defendants
in
their
absence,
at
least
if
they're
not
present
for
the
trial,
we're
not
going
to
permit
that
under
the
federal
rules.
that
was
the...
the
whole
point
of
incorporating
diaz.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
factually,
that's
correct,
and
that
is
one
of
the
points
on
which
the
circuit
courts
have
distinguished
diaz.
but
the
point
about
diaz
is
that
it
lays
down
the
common
law
rule.
and
even
though
the...
factually,
the
defendant
in
that
case
was
initially
present,
that
doesn't
lessen
or
detract
the
force
of
that
common
law
rule.
and
that's
what
this...
or
the
advisory
committee
and
this
court
was
adopting
when
it
promulgated
rule
43.
if
one
looks
at
the
advisory
committee
note
to
rule
43,
the
exact
page
of
the
diaz
opinion
is
the
one
cited,
the
page
where
the
common
law
rule
is
discussed,
page
455.
so
it's
obvious
that
when
the
advisory
committee
was
thinking
about
diaz,
it
was
thinking
about
that
common
law
rule
that
doesn't
admit
a
defendant
to
be
tried
unless
he's
initially
present.
the
common
law
and
case
law
origins
of
rule
40...
i've
been
talking
mainly
about
the
advisory
committee
treatment
of
the
rule,
and
that,
obviously,
deals
with
the
common
law
and
case
law
origins
of
rule
43.
but
if
one
looks
at
some
of
the
important
state
cases
cited
in
diaz,
it's
obvious
that
no
one
was
tried
in
his
absence
if
he
didn't
show
up
for
trial.
the
case
of
commonwealth
v.
mccarthy
specifically
said
it
is
irregular
and
improper
to
begin
trial
without
the
presence
of
the
accused.
in
state
v.
way,
a
kansas
case,
1907,
trial
cannot
begin
in
his
absence.
in
feit
v.
state,
an
ohio
case
from
1835,
the
court
said
the
trial
cannot
begin
in
the
defendant's
absence,
but
if
he
leaves
during
the
trial
it
may
proceed.
so
diaz
summarized...
gathered
together
and
summarized
all
the
state
cases
in
arriving
at
what
the
common
law
and
discerning
what
the
common
law
said
about
trial
in
absentia.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
i'm
a
little
ambivalent
about
that.
i
would
say,
first
of
all,
that
diaz
could
be
read
broadly
enough
to
equate
the
sixth
amendment
right
of
presence
to
the
common
law
rule.
but
that
seems
to
take
diaz
a
little
bit
too
far,
because
diaz
did,
in
fact,
deal
with
a
defendant
who
was
initially
present.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
in--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--although
i
think,
as
i
was
saying,
diaz
could
be
read
broadly
enough
to
say
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
cannot
be
waived,
practically
speaking
i
don't
think
that...
i'm
not
arguing
that
and
i
don't
think
the
sixth
amendment
should
be
so
read.
i
think
that
a
defendant
could
waive
his
or
her
constitutional
right
of
presence
prior...
prior
to
trial
by...
by
conduct
or
express--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--well,
they've...
they've
done
it
not
because
one
can
waive
a
constitutional
right.
i
mean,
the
right...
constitutional
right
of
presence,
i'm
not
arguing
that.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
common
law
aspect
of
rule
43...
and
rule
43
incorporates
not
only
the
constitutional
right
of
presence,
but
the
common
law
right
of
presence.
that's
why
it's
broader
than
the
constitution.
a
defendant
could
waive
the
constitutional
right
of
presence,
but
it
would
have
to
be
a
knowing,
voluntary,
and
intelligent
waiver.
and
our
position
would
be
that
there
was
no
waiver
of
the
constitutional
right
of
presence
because
nothing
in
the
record
shows
that
the
petitioner
was
ever
told
that
if
he
didn't
appear,
that
the
trial
could
proceed
in
his
absence.
and
i
don't
know,
in
this
context
at
least,
prior
to
trial,
how
one
could
have
a
knowing,
voluntary,
and
intelligence
waiver
if
one
didn't
know
the
consequence
of
absconding.
we
have
in
this
case...
or
in
this
country
no
common
law
tradition
of
trial
in
absentia,
which
is
another
reason
why
a
defendant
who
leaves
prior
to
trial
could
not
be
presumed
to
have
waived
the
constitutional
right
of
presence.
and
i'd
like...
as
long
as
i'm
talking
about
this,
i'd
like
to
distinguish
the
taylor
case.
in
taylor
v.
united
states,
this
court
said
that
it's
obvious
that
the
defendant
who
departs
after
the
trial
begins
must
be
presumed
to
know
that
in...
by
departing,
he
or
she
waives
the
right
of
presence
and
that
the
trial...
and
must
know
that
the
trial
will
continue
in
his
absence.
that's
not
the
situation
as
to
a
defendant
prior
to
trial
who's
never
been
advised
of
the
consequences
and
who
is
not
in
the
midst
of
a
trial.
in
19...
i
was
mentioning
earlier
that
in
1973
the
common
law...
or,
i'm
sorry,
the
advisory
committee
proposed
an
amendment
to
rule
43
that
would
have
addressed
this
situation.
it
would
have
permitted
a
defendant
who
did
not
appear
for
the...
for
the
beginning
of
his
trial
to
be
tried
if
there
was
a
finding
of
a
knowing
and
voluntary
disappearance
without
justification.
in
a
note
to
that
proposed
amendment
the
advisory
committee
said
that
this
subdivision
is
added
to
make
clear
that
a
defendant
not
present
at
the
start
of
the
trial,
the
requirement
of
the...
of
the
current
rule,
may
be
tried
in
absentia.
in
other
words,
in
1973
the
proposed
amendment
said
or
recognized
that
the
current
requirement
is
that
the
defendant
has
to
be
present
and
trial
cannot
proceed
without
him.
the
government
quotes
that
proposed...
or
makes
reference
to
that
proposed
amendment
in
its
brief,
but
they
don't
make
reference
to
that
comment
by
the
advisory
committee
which
recognizes
what
the
current
rule
requires.
the
government's
arguments
as
to
why
the
rule
does
not
address
the
situation
are
incorrect.
the
government
argues
that
because
rule
43
does
not
prohibit
trial
in
absentia,
it
must
permit
it.
there's
no...
but
the
government
cites
no
authority
for
this.
obviously,
the
rule...
the
plain
language
of
the
rule
doesn't
permit
that.
the
advisory
or
the
drafting
history
of
the
rule
is...
or
contradicts
that
and,
as
in
the
case
of
commonwealth
v.
felton,
there
are
no
cases
prior
to
rule
43
that
permit
a
trial
in
absentia
of
a
defendant
not
initially
present.
the
structure
of
the
rule
also
argues
against
the
result...
or
the
government's
point.
the
government
says
that
rule
43
doesn't
address
this,
but
it's
odd
that
if,
in
drafting
a
rule,
the
only
waiver
provision
contemplated
has
to
do
with
the
defendant
who
is
initially
present.
in
other
words,
if
the
rule
were
going
to
be
drafted
to
permit
the
result
the
government
wants,
it
would
have
been
a
simple
matter
to
make
the
waiver
provision
include
not
only
defendants
initially
present
but
also
those
who
are
not
initially
present.
so
the
structure
of
the
rule
argues
against
the
government's...
the
result
the
government
wants.
the
government
argues
that
defendants
will
be
able
to
manipulate
the
system
if
the
rule
is
interpreted
as
we
ask
it
to
be
interpreted.
well,
the
government's
concerns
about
defendants
holding
up
trials
and
flaunting
justice
obviously
had
to
have
been
known
to
the
drafters
of
the
rule,
and
the
government's
argument
now
seeks
to
elevate
that
concern
above
the
rule
that
was
drafted
in
awareness
of
it.
there
is
at
least
one
state
that
has
specifically,
by
case
law,
prohibited
trying
a
defendant
not
initially
present
and
that's
pennsylvania.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
problem
that
pennsylvania
has
had
in
trying
its
defendants
and
in
making
sure
that
its
court
system
operates
smoothly
and
efficiently.
there
are
means
to
discourage
defendants
who
are
not
initially...
or
who
are
on
bail
and
contemplate
absconding
prior
to
trial.
we
don't
have
to
go
to
the
extreme
of
holding
the
trials
in
their
absence.
defendants
can
be
required,
as
a
condition
of
their
release,
to
appear
at
trial.
if
they
don't,
they
know
that
their
bail
will
be
forfeited.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
a
defendant
who's
been
given...
or
who's
been
released
prior
to
trial
could
be...
have
his
bail
revoked
or
he
could
be
detained
initially.
there
just
is
no
reason
why
we
have
to
go
to
the
extreme
of
trying
defendants
who
are
not
initially
present.
the
implications
of
the
court's
decision
should
be
important
in
the
result...
in
reaching
the
result
that
we're
asking
for.
first
of
all,
if
the
court
finds
that
a
defendant
not
initially
present
can
be
tried
in
spite
of
the
clear
language
of
the
rule,
it's
going
to
be
creating
a
wedge
effect.
the
government
will
be
seeking
to
try
defendants
at
an
earlier
and
earlier
stage
of
the
trial.
the
next
stage,
obviously,
will
be
the
defendant
who
hasn't
been
arraigned.
now,
arraignment
is
a
precondition
of
trial,
or
is
a
sine
qua
non
of
trial,
but
if
the
government
is
able
to
succeed
in
this
case
in
having
the
rule
ignored,
then
why
not
ignore
the
part
of
the
rule
that
says
the
defendant
cannot
be
tried
unless
he's
been
arraigned?
and
the
requirement
that
the
defendant
be
arraigned
prior
to
trial
is
the
same
part
of
the
rule
requiring
his
presence
at
trial.
so
what
the
court
would
be
doing
here
is
creating
a
precedent
for
interpreting
the
requirement
of
presence
at
arraignment
to
be
superfluous,
to
not
really
mean
what
it
says.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
exactly.
and
in
this
case
the
court
did...
the
district
court
that
tried
the
petitioner
did
not
sentence
him
in
his
absence.
it
abided
by
that
part
of
the
rule.
so
to
be
consistent
in
interpreting
the
rule,
it's
necessary
to
give
effect
to
all
parts
of
it.
so
the
part
that
says
the
defendant
has
to
be
present
at
arraignment
should
be
interpreted
consistently
with
the
part
of
the
rule
that
says
the
defendant
has
to
be
present
at
trial
and
at
sentencing.
and
they're
all
in
the
same...
all
in
rule
43(a).
the
rule
doesn't
admit
of
distinctions
or
of
differences
in
interpretation
as
to
those
clauses.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
well,
there--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--well,
i
have--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--but
it's
that
inconvenience
and
that's...
the
problems
that
defendants
create
when
they
abscond,
that
is
irrelevant
under
the
rule.
it
was
irrelevant
to
the
common
law.
i
mean
it
wasn't
unimportant,
but
it...
it
wasn't
made
paramount.
the
defendant's
presence
at
the
trial
was
made
paramount.
so
your
concern
is--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--well--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--that
very
reason
goes
to,
really,
what's
at
the
root
of
the
problem
here.
it
wasn't
inconvenient
to
postpone
the
petitioner's
sentencing,
it
was
inconvenient
to
postpone
his
trial.
but
it's
that
inconvenience
that
is
irrelevant
under
the
common
law,
it's
irrelevant
under
the
rule.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
it
is,
but
that's
why
this
court
needs
to
take
a
stand
and
let
the
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeal
know
that
rules
must
be
enforced
as
written.
if
the
rule
is--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--no.
if
the
rule
is
inconvenient,
if
this
court
doesn't
want
to
tolerate
the
results
it
that
would
obtain
here,
it
can
change
the
rule.
it's...
i'm
not
arguing
that
this
rule
should
remain
forever.
it's
not
that
difficult
a
process
to
change
a
rule.
this
court
has
the
authority
to
initiate
changes,
and
i,
by
no
means,
am
arguing
that
this
rule
must
be
retained.
but
it...
as
long
as
it's
in
effect,
as
long
as
its
meaning
is
clear,
it
must
be
given
effect.
and
giving
the
rule
effect
will
have
a
salutary
effect
on
the
enforcement
of
other
rules.
you
won't
have
district
courts
departing
from
other
rules
that
produce
inconvenient
results.
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
thank
you.
the
government
is
arguing
now
that
rule
43
doesn't
address
this
situation.
although
this
isn't...
or
terribly
significant,
it
is
important
that
the
interpretation
the
government
is
urging
now
is
not
the
one
the
government
took
at
trial.
at
page
15
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
prosecutor
said
when
this
subject
came
up,
the
possibility
of
trying
mr.
crosby
in
absentia...
the
prosecutor
said:
the
rule
appears
to
require
that
the
defendant
be
there
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
and
that
you
proceed
if
he
takes
off,
and
that
is
usually
the
way
it
happens.
the
government
went
on
to
urge
or
to
cite
the
many
circuits
that
have
said
this
is
okay
to
do,
but
it's
significant
that
the
reading
that
they
are
giving
the
rule
now
is
not
the
reading
that
they
gave
the
rule
when
the
question
first
arose.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
well,
the
prosecutor...
when
the
question
arose,
let's
think
about
trying
mr.
crosby
in
absentia,
the
prosecutor
got
out
the
rule
and
her
comment
was,
quote:
the
rule
appears
to
require
that
the
defendant
be
there
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial
and
that
you
proceed
if
he
takes
off,
and
that
is
usually
the
way
it
happens.
in
other
words,
the
prosecutor--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--yes,
justice
kennedy,
that
was
the
point
i
was
making,
that
the
government
went
on
to
urge
the
cases,
or
to
cite
the
cases
in
the
circuits
that
permit
the--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--well,
the
plain
reading,
or
the
reading
the
prosecutor
was
giving
it
was
not
the
one
the
government
is
giving
it
now.
that's
the
only
point
i'm
making.
i'm
not
saying
that's
dispositive
of
the
case,
but
they
are
being...
the
government
is
inconsistent
in
its
argument.
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
no,
the
prosecutor
then
cited
the
cases
or
went
on
to
urge
that
the
cases
indicate
you
can
proceed...
proceed
against
him.
the
government,
or
the
solicitor,
made
the
statement
that
a
defendant
can
be
proceeded
against
even
if
he
or
she
is
not
at
the
arraignment.
i
don't
know
of
any
authority
for
that.
it's...
arraignment,
at
least
under
crane
v.
united
states,
is
an
absolute
to...
prerequisite
to
proceeding
against
a
defendant.
and
in
crane,
the
defendant's
conviction
was
reversed
because,
although
he
was
present
at
every
other
proceeding,
the
defendant
had
never
been
arraigned.
so
i
don't
know
any
authority
for
that
contention.
the
circuit
court
opinions
make
the...
make
some
rather
facile
distinctions
in
getting
around
rule
43.
they
say
that
since
the
defendant
can
waive
his
presence
at
any
early
stage
of
the
trial
when
some
fairly...
or
less
significant
events
like
jury
selection
are
going
on,
and
he...
why
can't
he
waive
it
at
the
beginning
of
the
trial.
that
clouds
the
reasoning
behind
the
common
law
rule,
which
was
to
draw
a
bright
line
at
the
beginning
of
trial.
the
common
law
has
recognized,
as
does
rule
43,
that
a
defendant
can
waive
the
right
of
presence
after
the
trial
begins,
but
to
reason
that...
within
those
parameters,
that
because
he
can
waive
it
during
different
stages,
that
he
can
waive
it
prior
to
the
trial
is
illogical.
it's
taking
the
common
law
rule
and
basically
pulling
the
rug
out
from
under
it.
that's
not
what
the
common
law
did.
it
didn't
permit
the
trial
in
absentia
prior...
if
the
defendant
wasn't
there.
the
government
took
some
pains
to
point
out
that
mr.
crosby's
presence
appears
to
have
been
deliberate
and
calculated
to
postpone
the
trial.
this,
again,
was
a
circumstance
well-known
to
the
common
law
and
well-known
to
the
drafters
of
the
rule,
and
yet
they
didn't
write
the
rule
to
distinguish
between
defendants
who
are
absent
through
no
fault
of
their
own
and
those
who
deliberately
abscond.
that's
just
irrelevant
under
the
rule.
the
government
makes
the
point
that
a
defendant,
if
the
rule
is
interpreted
as
we
urge,
will
have
an
incentive
to
leave
at
an
early
stage
of
the
trial.
well,
a
defendant
has
an
incentive
to
leave
prior
to
arraignment
since
it's
obvious
the
defendant
can't
be
proceeded
against
if
he
hasn't
been
arraigned.
so
if
there's
an
incentive
to
leave
at
an
early
stage,
it
occurs
prior
to
the
trial.
that
would
be
the
smartest
point
at
which
to
abscond,
is
prior
to
arraignment,
since
no
one
disputes
that
a
defendant
cannot
be
tried
if
he
hasn't
been
arraigned.
the
point
that...
the
question
that
justice--
mr.
mark
d.
nyvold
--that's
true.
but
the
common
law
recognized
that
it
was
only
at
the
point
at
which
the
trial
began
that
that
inconvenience
factor
would
weigh...
would
predominate
and
favor...
and
permit
the
trial
of
a
defendant
who's
not
initially
present.
thank
you.
