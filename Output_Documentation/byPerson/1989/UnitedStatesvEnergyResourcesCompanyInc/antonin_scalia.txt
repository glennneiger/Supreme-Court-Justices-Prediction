justice
scalia
the
irs
is
just
big
hearted
on
voluntary
payments?
i
find
that
hard
to
believe.
you
really
think
that
you're--
justice
scalia
--that
you're
complying
with
some
common
law
rule?
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
there
are
other
penalties
for
forcing
the
irs
to
go
to
court.
they
really
have
to
give
them
that
free
gift
in
order
to
induce
them
not
to
go
to
court?
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
doing
this
for
voluntary
payments
simply
because
that's
what
the
law
is.
that
is
how
voluntary
payments
are.
if
i
give
you
money
for
x,
you
either
accept
it
for
x
or
you
give
it
back
to
me.
that's
the
law
in
every
other...
in
private
transactions.
why
wouldn't
it
be
so
with
regard
to
the
irs?
if
they
want
to
use
it
for
something
else
they
say
i'm
sorry,
we
can't
accept
the
limitation,
but
if
you
don't
accept
the
limitation
you
don't
accept
the
payment.
justice
scalia
the
reason
it
is
important
to
me,
why
the
irs
is...
does
this
with
respect
to
voluntary
payments,
is
i
have
no
idea
what
the
difference
is
between
voluntary
and
involuntary,
or
where
one
looks
for
that
distinction,
except
you
invite
us
to
look
to
what
the
irs
has
done
in
the
past.
and
you
seem
to
assert
that
we
should
be
bound...
it
is
voluntary
where
the
irs
says
it
is
voluntary,
and
it
is
involuntary
where
the
irs
says
it
is
involuntary.
what
else
do
you
tie
that
distinction
to,
unless
it
is
the
will
of
the
irs?
justice
scalia
it's
called
the
common
law,
it
was
called.
justice
scalia
but
you
choose
to
call
this
involuntary.
and
you
want
us
to
accept
it
because
you
choose
to
call
it
involuntary.
justice
scalia
--you
mean
the
question
is
whether
it
becomes
the
irs'
money,
until
the
irs
agrees
to
accept
it
in
the
manner
in
which
is
it
offered.
justice
scalia
i
think
it
is
in
one
and
not
in
the
other.
that's
my--
--they
just
went
to
court
for
the
order,
but--
--well,
what...
what
if
the
debtor
here,
if
they
simply,
without
any
approval
of
the
bankruptcy
court
other
than
the
plan,
it
simply
made
this
payment
and
said
i
want
it
applied
to
the
trust
fund
liabilities?
justice
scalia
no,
no.
right
now.
at
the
point
he
made
this
payment.
justice
scalia
is
it
before
the
bankruptcy
either.
did
they
have
the
discretion
to
pay
or
not
to
pay
their
taxes
before
they
went
bankrupt?
justice
scalia
whatever
the
reason,
it
gets
the
officers
off
the
hook.
the
corporation
first
has
to
satisfy--
justice
scalia
mr.
horowitz,
before
you
stop,
what
do
you
say...
you
started
to
talk
about
chapter
11.
you
say
there
is
no
provision
in
there
that
lets
the
court
do
this.
what
do
you
do
with
section
1123(b)(5),
which
says
that
the
plan
may
include
any
other
appropriate
provision
not
inconsistent
with
the
applicable
provisions
of
this
title?
justice
scalia
so
the
issue
is
just
whether
this
is
appropriate?
justice
scalia
of
this
title.
justice
scalia
you
assert
it's
inconsistent
with
the--
justice
scalia
the
tax
law
is
full
of
irony,
mr.
moss.
why...
what's
the
matter
with
this
one?
why...
the
irs
says
it
has
this
policy,
voluntary
versus
nonvoluntary
and
that
what
makes
the
difference
is
whether
there
has
been
a
court
proceeding
and
whether
the
payment
is
under
court
order
or
not.
it's
a
line,
it's
certainly
a
clear
line
at
least.
justice
scalia
suppose
that
the
irs
is
taking
the
position...
let's
assume
they
are...
we
don't
have
to
treat
anything
the
way
you
want
and
let
you
designate,
that
in
fact
we
are
the
government.
and
any
money
we
get
that
you
owe
the
government,
we
can
attribute
it
to
what
we
like.
is
there
anything
wrong
in
principle
with
beginning
from
that
standpoint
and
then
saying
out
of
the
goodness
of
our
heart...
or
really,
not
for
that
reason,
but
in
order
to
prevent
litigation...
we
are
going
to
adopt
the
rule
nonetheless,
even
though
we
have
the
power
to
treat
it
all
the
way
we
want,
we
won't
treat
it
the
way
we
want
if
you
haven't
made
us
go
to
court.
that
makes
sense.
justice
scalia
what
would
happen
if
the
irs
sued
them
immediately
and
got
all
the
money
from
them?
what
would
happen
with
the
money
that
was
supposed
to
be
paid
to
the
government
under
the
plan?
wouldn't
that
money
go
to
them?
wouldn't
they
have
a
cause
of
action
to
be
reimbursed
by
the
corporation,
or
not?
or
we
don't
know?
justice
scalia
well,
excuse
me,
if
you
move
to
dismiss
it
for
noncompliance,
then
you
are
back
in
the
situation
you
were
in
pre-plan,
i
assume,
right?
justice
scalia
you
have
the
same
legal
remedies
under
the
statute
that
you
had.
justice
scalia
it's
not
a
very
useful
court
order.
you're
saying
the
penalty
for
not
obeying
the
court
order
is
the
court
order
is
eliminated.
