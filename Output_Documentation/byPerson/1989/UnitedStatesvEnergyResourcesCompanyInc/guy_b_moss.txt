mr.
guy
b.
moss
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
where
we
seem
to
disagree
is
whether
the
payments
made
under
a
confirmed
plan
are
voluntary,
and
the
consequences
if
they
are
not.
i
think
if
there
is
one
word
that
is
going
to
become
the
key
to
the
decision
here
it
will
be
control.
it
is
not
a
perfect
word,
but
it
is
a
good
word
for
this
case.
we
suggest
that
the
tax
payments
under
a
plan
are
voluntary
because
the
debtor
taxpayer
controls
the
use
of
the
funds.
and
we
say
if
that
is
not
the
conclusion
that
this
court
chooses
to
reach,
then
control
must
be
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
as
a
result
the
court
has
the
power
to
designate
the
allocation
of
the
taxes
paid.
let
me
start
with
a
test
that
occupied
the
bulk
of
mr.
horowitz's
time,
and
suggest
an
example
that
we
can
discuss.
a
simple
$100,000
tax
debt
existing
on
the
eve
of
bankruptcy.
of
that,
$60,000
constitute
so-called
trust
fund
taxes
and
$40,000
anything
else:
income,
excise,
matching
fica,
what
have
you.
now,
take
the
day
before
the
bankruptcy
filing.
the
taxpayer
is
in
hopeless
financial
trouble,
is
insolvent.
the
irs
may
have
sent
out
notices,
demands,
revenue
agents,
is
all
over
the
company.
the
risk
upon
default
is
levy,
seizure.
and
the
corporation,
a
day
or
two
before
the
bankruptcy
sends
a
check,
let's
make
it
a
certified
teller's
check,
to
the
irs
and
pays
the
$60,000
in
trust
fund
taxes,
thereby
helping
the
responsible
officers.
no
issue
here.
irs
says
that
is
fine.
and
whether
or
not
anyone
is
blameworthy,
whether
or
not
the
irs
position
is
impaired
and
it
is
stuck
with
the
nontrust
fund
taxes,
that
is
fine.
it
reflects
the
common
law.
we
don't
have
a
case.
now
let's
take
the
case--
mr.
guy
b.
moss
--the
trustee
may,
and
i
realize
that
is
a
case
working
its
way
up
to
this
court.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
depending...
and
not
decided
yet.
i
don't
think
that
is
relevant
to
this
issue.
it
may
or
may
not
be
a
preference
and
usually
will
not
be,
because
the
test
for
a
preference
requires
that
the
party
receiving
it
do
better
than
it
would
upon
bankruptcy.
and
because
the
taxes
are
priority,
it
is
relatively
rare
that
the
irs
receiving
a
prepayment
sum
would
be
in
that
position.
usually
there
are
enough
free
funds
to
go
beyond
the
priorities,
and
that
is
why
the
usual
preference
issue
concerns
payments
to
unsecured
creditors.
now,
let's
take
the
situation
we
have.
after
the
plan
is
confirmed,
and
we
are
in
that
situation
right
now
with
these
two
cases.
the
taxpayer
is
now
rehabilitated.
the
plan
has
been
confirmed
by
a
bankruptcy
court.
the
plan
has
been
found
feasible.
the
flexibility
that
congress
gave
to
the
debtor
to
stretch
out
tax
payments
over
six
years
from
date
of
assessment
has
been
utilized
by
the
debtor.
it
won't
happen
in
every
case,
but
it
did
here.
the
irs
is
owed
an
undisputed
sum.
the
irs
has
not
sent
out
any
notices
or
demands,
because
it
is
now
passively
awaiting
the
payment
of
the
taxes
under
the
plan.
the
same
risk
of
default
exists
as
was
the
case
before.
and
the
corporation
sends
out
the
same
check,
although
it
is
not
likely
it
will
be
certified
this
time,
to
the
service
and
pays
the
installment
that
is
due
under
the
plan.
now,
i
suggest
there
is
little
if
any
difference
in
that
scenario
from
the
pre-bankruptcy,
except
that
it
is
better.
and
yet
under...
it
is
better
in
the
sense
that
the
debtor
is
more
in
control
of
its
situation.
it
has
made
its
peace
with
its
creditors.
the
plan
has
been
confirmed,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
but
this
time
when
the
irs
gets
that
check
in
the
mail
somebody
says
wait
a
minute,
it's
involuntary.
send
it
back
because
our
policy,
our
interpretation
of
the
common
law
says
we
don't
accept
them
when
a
letter
accompanies
the
check,
as
it
did,
allocating
the
payment
to
the
trust
fund
section
of
the
taxes.
so
the
irony
is
that
at
a
time
the
taxpayer
has
wider
latitude
than
it
did
before,
the
government
has
a
harsher
position,
and
this
fight
ensues.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
i
think
the
irony
lies
simply
in
examining
the
government's
response
along
the
continuum
of
the
common
law
situation,
at
least
as
we
view
it.
when
things
are
at
their
harshest
and
most
out
of
control
there
is
no
issue
between
the
parties,
and
when
things
are
calmest
and
most
in
control
and
a
reorganization
has
been
structured,
that
probably
maximizes
the
likelihood
that
the
entire
creditor
body
will
do
better
than
it
did
before,
we
wind
up
in
this
controversy.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
i
think
the
best
response
i
can
offer
to
that
is
the
standard
phrase
it's
a
country
of
laws
and
not
men.
the
internal
revenue
service
is
but
one
creditor.
it
has
an
important
function
for
the
country,
which
is
to
raise
revenue.
but
it
doesn't
act
in
a
vacuum.
and
the
many,
many
provisions
of
chapter
11
that
affect
the
rights
of
creditors
as
they
have
them
pre-bankruptcy
suggest
that,
for
the
purpose
of
fostering
reorganization,
what
a
particular
creditor
would
like
to
do
in
a
context
of
nonbankruptcy
it
cannot
do
in
a
context
of
bankruptcy,
and
congress
says
that
it
should
not
do.
i
view
this
case
as
really
an
extension
of
that.
look
at
the
various
sections
that
go
to
that
observation.

tax
claims
themselves
are
not
all
priorities,
even
though
revenue
collection
is
certainly
a
policy
that
we
all
feel
is
extremely
important.
some
taxes
are
nonpriority,
and
those
nonpriority
taxes
would
be
treated
the
same
as
all
the
general
unsecured
creditors.
and
in
a
straight
bankruptcy
if
the
assets
were
not
sufficient,
those
unsecured
tax
claims,
or,
i
should
say
those
nonpriority
tax
claims,
would
not
even
be
paid.

section
726,

in
your
whiting
pools
case,
under
section
543,
seized
property
might
have
to
be
disgorged
to
assist
the
reorganization
effort.
and
the
very
provision
that
gave
rise
to
this
dispute,
tax
claims
may
be
paid
over
six
years,
under
section
1129(a)(9).
now
congress,
i
think,
put
that
in
to
facilitate
cash
flow
problems
that
would
face
a
reorganizing
debtor.
but
when
it
did
so,
the
irs
was
put
at
the
mercy
that,
at
some
point
as
those
six
years
evolved,
the
debtor
might
not
survive
and
might
not
be
able
to
make
the
payments.
in
between
these
two
periods
that
i
mentioned,
the
pre-bankruptcy
day
before
when
the
check
is
paid,
and
the
post-bankruptcy
day
after
when
the
check
is
paid,
let's
look
at
what
the
government
suggests
is
so
important
here.
indeed,
i
think
that
one
might
even
question
how
relevant
any
of
it
is,
because
in
light
of
our
emphasis
upon
control,
what
we
think
is
fairly
significant
is
that
on
the
day
that
those
post-confirmations
are
being...
payments
are
being
made,
the
debtor
has
received
the
benefit
of
section
1141,
the
assets
have
revested
in
the
debtor,
all
creditors
abound
by
the
plan,
and
with
full
control
over
and
custody
of
the
funds,
the
taxpayer
makes
the
payments.
but
it
is
true
that
the
cases
have
focussed
upon,
to
some
measure,
what
takes
place
during
the
course
of
the
chapter
11.
so,
notwithstanding
my
suggestion
that
it
may
or
may
not
be
terribly
relevant,
let's
look
at
the
arguments.
the
debtor
says...
i
am
sorry,
the
government
says
the
debtor
lacks
options.
but
as,
i
think,
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
the
debtor
always
lacks
options
to
pay
involuntary
taxes.
that
is,
taxes
are
involuntary
in
that
the
law
says
they
arise
under
certain
circumstances.
but
yet
the
debtor
is
afforded
more
options
in
a
chapter
11
than
it
had
before,
because
it
is
given
the
six-year
provision
and
it
is
given
the
hiatus
period
to
work
out
of
its
troubles.
the
government
says
the
tax
is
a
priority.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
it
is
not.
the
government
made
that
argument
in
its
brief,
and
it
made
it
to
suggest
that
there
is
some
type
of
judicial
activity
taking
place
here
that
is
of
the
nature
of
involuntariness,
like
the
court
approving
a
seizure
or
a
levy
or
something
of
that.
i
suggest
that
when
we
look
at
the
applicable
statute,
which
i
think
is
section
1129
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
the
one
that
sets
the
standards
for
when
a
plan
may
be
confirmed.
what
that
statute
says
is
that
the
court
shall
confirm
a
plan
that
meets
the
following
requirements.
now
there
are,
i
think,
11
requirements.
some
are
relatively
unimportant
and
some
are
very
important.
the
two
that
probably
are
germane
to
this
case
are
1129(a)(9),
that
says
the
plan
shall
provide
for
full
payment
of
priority
taxes,
but
may
do
so
over
the
course
of
six
years
with
interest,
and
the
section,
i
think,
1129(a)(11),
that
says
the
plan
shall
be
feasible,
or
the
exact
language
is
not
likely
to...
the
corporation
is
not
likely
to
run
into
the
immediate
need
of
bankruptcy
relief
again.
there
is
no
court
order
in
the
sense
that
the
court
says
thou
shalt
do
x,
y
or
z.
the
court
says
that
the
standards
of
1129
have
been
met
and
the
plan
may
be
confirmed.
and
then
you
go
to
section
1141
that
says
that
when
a
plan
has
been
confirmed,
all
creditors
are
bound
by
it.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
both
plans
provided
that
the
priority
tax
payments
would
be
paid
over
a
period
of
time
with
interest.
one
plan--
mr.
guy
b.
moss
--one
plan
may
have
used
four
years,
one
six
years.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
yes.
you
must,
and
indeed
the
government
objected
to
the
energy
resources--
mr.
guy
b.
moss
--the
penalty
that
attaches
is
the
penalty
that
existed
before
the
chapter
11.
the
debtor...
section
1141,
and
this
is
backing
into
your
question
with
a
statutory
observation--
mr.
guy
b.
moss
--okay.
the
penalty...
i
am
prepared
to
answer
it.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
that
depends
on
whether
or
not
the
bankruptcy
court
still
has
retained
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
the
answer--
mr.
guy
b.
moss
--the
typical
situation,
i
am
not
sure
there
is
one.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
the
area
of
retained
jurisdiction
is
an
area
that
counsel
will
often
focus
upon
carefully.
sometimes
a
creditors
committee
will
negotiate.
the
creditors
committee
is
not
a
committee
that
worries
about
the
service,
but
it
will
sometimes
negotiate
for
retained
jurisdiction
to
watch
over
the
plan,
and
sometimes
will
not.
so
in
some
cases
the
bankruptcy
court
loses
jurisdiction
over
the
case
before
these
tax
payments
are
completed,
and
in
other
cases,
depending
upon
whether
the
provision
is
in
the
plan,
the
court
will
keep
it.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
i
believe
that
that
is
possible
for
it
to
do.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
well,
it
may
and
may
not,
because
i
think
more
typically
what
the
service
would
do
is
invoke
its
levy
and
seizure
procedures.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
but
in
pre-bankruptcy
i
see
no
reason
that
a,
the
internal
revenue
service
could
not
go
to
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
and
ask
for
the
same
type
of
order.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
because
money
is
owed.
it
would
be
a
collection
suit.
the
irs
is
unlikely
to
do
it
because
its
powers
are
vast,
and
i
think
we
all
know
that.
so
that
rather
than
go
to
the
court
like
a
typical
plaintiff,
it
has
the
ability
more
than
any
other
creditor
in
this
country
to
take
unitary
action
and
seize
assets
after,
i
believe,
assessments
are
made.
it
could
do
that
pre-bankruptcy,
it
could
do
that
post-confirmation.
the
only
time
it
can't
do
it
is
when
the
debtor
is
under
court
control,
and
that
is
during
the
chapter
11
period,
prior
to
confirmation
of
the
plan.
the
government
also
cites
that
because
a
claim
was
filed
there
is
some
significance
that
transfers
this
from
a
controlled
payment
to
an
uncontrolled
payment.
as
mr.
horowitz
argued
common
sense,
i
might
also.
firstly,
in
a
chapter
11,
under
section
1111(a),
a
proof
of
claim
need
not
even
be
filed
if
there
is
no
dispute
over
the
debt.
a
debtor
is
obligated
to
file
schedules.
they
are
done
under
oath,
and
they
state
what
the
indebtedness
is
to
each
creditor
it
has.
if
the
service
looked
at
those
schedules
and
agreed,
its
failure
to
file
a
proof
of
claim
would
not
cause
it
any
harm.
the
claim
is
deemed
proved,
allowed,
and
must
be
dealt
with
under
the
plan.
all
the
proof
of
claim
is
is
one
piece
of
paper
that
has
a
signature
and
an
amount
of
money
on
it.
it
may
be
important
when
it
is
due,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
it
isn't
much.
and
in
the--
mr.
guy
b.
moss
--it's
quite
important
to
the
creditor,
without
question,
but
i
don't
think
that
this
one
piece
of
paper
should
be
the
touchstone
between
the
court
determining
that
this
is
a
controlled
or
voluntary
payment
within
the
meaning
of
the
common
law--
mr.
guy
b.
moss
--yes,
in
both--
mr.
guy
b.
moss
--well,
as
to
the
first
question,
i
believe
that
the
decisions
in
both
cases
and
the
record
do
suggest
that
the
court
took
into
account
reasons
for
doing
this.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
in
the
case
of
newport,
this
was
a
plan
funded
by
a
third
party.
an
entity
not
before
the
court
ended
up
with
85
percent
of
the
stock.
and
there
were
a
variety
of
tradeoffs
that
were
entered
into
at
the
time
that
the
plan
was
structured.
the
responsible
officers
had
a
wide
variety
of
claims,
unsecured
and
secured,
and
as
part
of
this
array
of
tradeoffs,
they
were
put
into
a
separate
class.
they
waived
the
secured
claim.
they
reduced,
i
believe,
the
unsecured
claim.
and
they,
i
believe,
bargained
for
this
tax
designation
provision
as
part
of
it.
they
also--
mr.
guy
b.
moss
--yes.
yes.
there
is
no
question
that
such
a
provision
reduces
the
exposure
of
the
responsible
officers
to
the
extent
that
the
corporate
tax
payments
over
time
are
not
made.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
well,
the
debtor
recognized,
and
it
is
worth
noting
that
counsel
for
the
debtor,
by
the
way,
is
not
counsel
for
the
responsible
officers,
or
you
would
never
be
appointed
to
that
position
at
the
start
of
the
chapter
11.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
chapter
11
is
an
endless
process
of
negotiation,
and
there
are
reasons,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
one,
why
these
tradeoffs
are
requested.
one
which
she
noted
was
that
you
need
an
inducement,
and
it
makes
sense
to
have
that
inducement
to
the
people
controlling
the
corporation
not
to
tank
the
company.
so
that
in
a
chapter
7
the
priority
taxes
will
be
paid
off
the
top
first.
and
interestingly
enough,
they
run
a
risk
by
not
doing
so
and
by
moving
forward
with
a
reorganization
plan.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
no,
it's...
the
government
took
the
position
that
it
is
immaterial
to
creditors,
and
your
question,
which
i
would
like
to
answer
with
that
observation,
says
is
it
immaterial
to
the
debtor.
you
have
an
almost
endless
variety
of
things
that
can
occur
in
a
chapter
11.
it
doesn't
follow.
for
example,
the
responsible
officers
quite
often
will
own
the
company
at
the
commencement
of
the
case.
not
always,
because
sometimes
they
are
not
the
equity
holders
and
sometimes
they
are
fired.
and
certainly,
as
equity
holders,
they
often
will
strive
to
own
the
company
at
the
end
of
the
case.
now,
in
doing
so,
that
means
that
in
those
types
of
cases
when
it
is
reorganized
they
are
still
running
it,
and
they
own
it.
and
it
would
certainly
be
an
odd
kettle
of
fish
to
find
that,
after
doing
that
and
possibly
making
financial
contributions
to
the
plan,
the
service
is
then
pursuing
them
on
the
trust
fund
taxes
and
possibly
levying
upon
their
stock,
which
is
their
basis
for
owning
the
company.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
yes.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
that
is
correct,
but
in
one
sense
that
question
asks
if--
mr.
guy
b.
moss
--there
is
no
basis
for
going
after
the
officers.
the
primary
party
obligated
to
the
tax
creditor
is
the
corporation.
and
when
the
unsecured
creditors
negotiate
with
the
debtor
and
look
at
everything
going
on
to
try
to
formulate
the
best
possible
result
here,
they
take
into
account
that
the
debtor
must
pay
these
taxes.
the
responsible
officer
is
simply
liable
to
the
government
under
a
penalty
assessment--
mr.
guy
b.
moss
--not
at
all.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
not
at
all,
and
that
is
precisely
why,
in
the
balancing
of
policies
that
we
have
argued
in
the
brief,
the
tax
policy,
however
quite
important,
we
suggest
is
either
not
materially
impaired,
or
at
least
is
taken
into
account
in
other
ways.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
that's
correct.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
liability
for
that
purpose.
usually
the
trust
fund
payments
simply
never
existed.
that
is
not
to
take
away
the
blame,
and
we
are
not
here
to
praise
any
creditor,
or
any
debtor
rather,
who
does
not
pay
his
creditor.
the
reality
is--
mr.
guy
b.
moss
--the
taxes
simply...
net
payroll
was
made.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
i
am
not
asking
that
they
be
taken
off
the
hook.
the
section
6672
liability
remains.
both
parties
have
cited,
i
think,
the
same
cases
in
the
brief.
ours,
if
i
recall,
was
huckabee
auto
saying
that
6672
is
an
independent
source
of
collection
for
the
government,
and
that
it
is
inappropriate,
indeed
impermissible,
for
the
bankruptcy
court
to
enjoin
the
internal
revenue
service
from
pursuing
those
responsible
officers.
the
government
could
have
pursued
them
pre-bankruptcy,
during
bankruptcy
and
after
bankruptcy,
as
part
of
the
policy,
the
federal
policy
toward
tax
collection.
what's
taking
place
here,
i
suggest,
is
a
balancing
of
interests.
this
court
recognized
that--
mr.
guy
b.
moss
--that
is
correct.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
well,
it's...
i'm
sorry,
it's
a
question
of
my
being
careful
how
i
interpret
your
question.
at
any
given
moment,
to
the
extent
the
trust
fund
taxes
are
due,
they
are
not
taken
off
the
hook.
but
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
they
benefit
from
a
payment
that
is
allocated
to
the
trust
fund
portion.
so,
in
my
hypothetical,
if
the
$60,000
of
trust
fund
taxes
out
of
$100,000
were
to
be
paid
over
five
years,
say,
then
they
would
benefit
as
those
payments
ensue.
but
they
would
also
be
subject
to
irs
attack
also
as
those
payments
ensue,
because
it
would
probably
take
two
to
three
years
for
those
trust
fund
taxes
to
be
paid
in
full.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
what...
no,
i...
that
has
been
an
interesting
debate
in
a
number
of
law
firms.
my
view
of
what
probably
should
happen
is
that
from
the
corporate
standpoint
the
taxes
should
be
viewed
as
still
due.
the
government
should
receive
those
tax
payments,
which
then
gives
them
in
effect
a
double
payment.
they
are
not
looking
for
a
double
payment,
but
that
is
the
result.
and
then,
upon
the
existence
of
a
double
payment,
the
responsible
officer
can
sue
for
a
refund,
thereby
keeping
the
government
paid
in
full
and
ultimately
leaving
the
responsible
officer
in
the
position
of
a
kind
of
surety,
with
the
debtor
primarily
paying
and
the
responsible
officer
secondarily
liable.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
the
creditors
might
want
that,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
they...
that
they
can
have
it.
interestingly
enough,
those
same
creditors
are
often
the
ones
who
benefit
by
what
the
corporation
did
with
the
money--
mr.
guy
b.
moss
--no,
not
usually.
the
guarantor
is
secondarily
liable,
and
the
debtor
is
forced
to
meet
its
primary
responsibility.
in
fact,
while
it
is
not
the
case
here,
for
reasons
that
are
set
forth
in
the
code,
in
an
unsecured,
nontax
situation,
the
guarantor,
if
he
paid,
would
be
subrogated
to
the
position
of
the
creditor,
and
the
indebtedness
would
not
go
away.
mr.
guy
b.
moss
thank
you.
