mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
two
different
bankruptcy
court
disputes
that
were
consolidated
on
appeal
in
the
first
circuit.
they
present
a
single
issue:
whether
the
bankruptcy
courts
erred
in
ordering
the
irs
to
apply
the
periodic
payments
of
priority
taxes
that
are
required
under
a
chapter
11
reorganization
plan,
applying
those
payments
first
to
satisfy
the
debtor
corporation's
trust
fund
tax
liability.
that
is,
the
withholding
tax
liability
for
which
the
corporation's
responsible
officers
are
separately
and
personally
liable.
this
order
prevents
the
irs
from
applying
any
of
these
periodic
payments
to
the
corporation's
other,
nontrust
fund
tax
liabilities,
for
which
there
is
no
other
source
of
collection,
until
the
trust
fund
liability
is
completely
satisfied.
in
the
absence
of
this
court
order,
the
irs
would
apply
the
periodic
payments
in
the
reverse
manner,
in
accordance
with
its
usual
practice.
as
the
court
of
appeals
frankly
acknowledged--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's...
the
irs
has
a
policy
of
permitting
the
taxpayers
to
designate--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--there
is
no,
there
is
no
legal
provision
that
directs
the
irs
how
to
allocate,
either
voluntary
or
involuntary
or
any
other
kind
of
payment.
so
this
policy
pretty
much
comes
out
of
common
sense.
it
is
pretty
much
the
same
way--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--it's
not
a
question
of
being--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--it's
not
a
question
of
being
big
hearted,
i
don't
think,
justice
scalia.
in
a
normal
commercial
setting,
when
a
debtor
makes
a
payment
to
a
creditor
and
attaches
a
condition
to
it,
the
creditor
normally
is
forced
to
accept
that
condition,
because
if
he
doesn't
do
that
the
debtor
can
pull
back
the
payment
and
say
look,
if
you're
not
going
to
accept
that
condition,
then
i
am
not
going
to
pay
you.
now,
the
irs
is
not
quite
in
the
same
position,
because
it
has
administrative
remedies.
it
can
assess
the
tax
and
go
out
and
levy
on
it.
but
the
irs
prefers
not
to
do
that.
it
prefers
to
get
voluntary
payments.
it
saves
a
lot
of
costs
of
collection
and
what
not.
so
the
irs
has
a
matter
of
policy
of
encouraging
taxpayers
to
pay
voluntarily,
rather
than
requiring
the
irs
to
go
to
court
or
to
seize
onerous
designations
of
voluntary
payments.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
think--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--your
honor,
that's--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
in
this
case
these
are
involuntary
payments.
justice
scalia
asked
me
about
voluntary
payments,
i
think.
i
am
just
answering
that.
that
is
true,
the
taxpayer
can
then
withdraw
the
payment,
and
the
irs
would
then
have
to
go
to
court
to
get
it.
so
the
situation
is
similar.
the
irs
has
a
little
more
power.
it
doesn't
have
to
go
to
court,
excuse
me.
it
can
also
take
administrative
action
and
prefers
not
to
do
that.
so,
as
a
practical
common
sense
way
of
administering
the
tax
laws
in
the
same
practical
common
sense
way
that
private
debtors
and
creditors
deal
with
it,
the
irs
accepts
these
designations.
it
seems
like
a
perfectly
reasonable
thing
to
do,
whether
it
is
required
to
do
so
by
law,
by
something
that
is
implicit
in
the
code,
maybe
it
is,
maybe
it
isn't.
but
it
has
never
really
been
an
issue.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
our
position
here
is
that
the
bankruptcy
court
had
nothing
to
do
with
how
the
irs
was
going
to
allocate
payments.
there
is
a
payment...
the
irs
is
owed
a
certain
amount
of
taxes.
under
the
bankruptcy
code
these
taxes
are
of
equal
priority.
no
reason
for
the
bankruptcy
court
to
distinguish
between
the
nontrust
fund
and
the
trust
fund
taxes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
we
are...
we
do
argue,
which
i
plan
to
explain
in
more
detail
a
little
bit
later,
that
there
are
a
lot
of
policies
that
are
embodied
both
in
the
internal
revenue
code
and
the
bankruptcy
code
that...
with
which
there
is
at
least
some
tension
with
what
the
bankruptcy
court
did
here.
there
is
no...
there
is
obviously
no
specific
provision
in
the
bankruptcy
code
that
either
permits
or
forbids
the
bankruptcy
court
from
doing
this.
otherwise
this
case
probably
wouldn't
be
here.
this
is--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
think
the
irs'
own
policy
is
just
tied
to
the
will
of
the
irs.
now,
you
are
suggesting
that
there
is
some...
some
law
or
something
that
requires
the
irs--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
common
law
rule
that
requires
the
irs
to
do
this,
or
that
the
common
law
binds
the
irs.
and
so
now
the
bankruptcy
court
held...
i'm
sorry,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
there
was
something
that
prevented
the
irs
from
applying
its
policy
in
this
case,
namely
the
bankruptcy
court's
own
authority
to
deal
with
these
payments.
and
that
is
where
the
issue
is--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i
think
to
the
extent
that
some
of
the
bankruptcy
courts
in
this
area
have
fought
over
what
the
irs'
policy
is,
i
think
you
are
right.
that's
the
wrong
place
to
fight
the
battle.
the
irs'
policy
is
that
this
is
involuntary,
and
as
far
as--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--all
the
courts
of
appeals
have.
there
are
some
bankruptcy
courts--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
that's
true.
just
to
finish
the
point,
it's
a
very
sterile
inquiry
as
to
whether
this
is
the
irs'
policy
or
not.
i
mean,
we
think
clearly
it
is,
but
if
it
isn't,
if
the
court
somehow
takes
the
view
that
the
irs
is
misapplying
its
own
policy
and
doesn't
know
what
it
means
by
the
distinction
that
it
has
drawn,
then
i
imagine
the
irs
will
probably
clarify
that.
and
i
think
the
real
issue
here
is
whether
there
is
some
law,
either
the
common
law,
and
we
think
there
is
nothing
that
has
been
suggested
as
any
common
law
bar
to
it,
or
whether
there
is
something
in
the
bankruptcy
court's
power
that
prevents
the
irs
from
applying
these
payments
which
it
receives,
becomes
its
money
on
its
books,
in
a
way
that
will
preserve
its
security
and
its
ability
to
collect.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
bankruptcy
court
is
required
under
section
1129...
section
1129
sets
forth
a
lot
of
requirements
for
confirmation
of
a
plan,
and
the
bankruptcy
court
can
only
confirm
a
plan
if
it
meets
those
requirements.
whether
or
not
the
irs
objects,
it
would
object
on
a
ground
that
one
of
those
provisions
of
1129
was
not
satisfied.
so,
the
bankruptcy
court
can
overrule
the
irs'
objections
if
it
concludes
that
the
plan
satisfies
the
legal
requirements.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
absolutely.
we
will
comply
with
the
order
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
but
we
reserve
the
right
to
appeal
it,
which
is
what
we
have
done
here.
so
if
we
lose
this
case
in
the
supreme
court
we
will
abide
by
the
designation.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
to
the
trust
fund
tax
liability.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
well,
what
happened
in
the
energy
resources
case
was
that
the...
one
of
the
requirements
of
section
1129
is
that
all
of
the
priority
taxes,
which
includes
both
components
here,
have
to
be
paid
in
full
over,
within
a
six-year
period.
so,
when
the
first
payment
was
made
in
that
case,
the
debtor
sent
a
letter
saying
we
would
like
these
payments
to
be
applied
first
to
the
non...
excuse
me,
to
the
trust
fund
taxes.
and
the
irs
wrote
back
and
said
well,
we're
not
going
to
do
that
unless
you
get
a
court
order.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
and
then
they
went
and
got
a
court
order,
which
is
where--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
other
case,
as
i
recall,
they
just
went
and
got
a
court
order
first.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
there
may
have
been
a
provision
in
the
plan
to
which
the
irs
objected,
and
claimed
that
the
bankruptcy
court
does
not
have
the
authority
to
require
us
how
to...
remember,
what
the
bankruptcy
court
has
done
here
is...
there
is
no
question
that
the
money
is
being
paid
to
the
irs.
the
question
then
is
how
the,
once
it
becomes
the
irs'
money,
how
the
irs
is
going
to
deal
with
it
on
its
books,
which
liability
is
it
going
to
say
has
been
satisfied.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
that
i
think
is
the
difference
between
what
everyone
agrees
is
a
voluntary
payment
and
what
we
have
here,
because
under
section
1129
there
is
no
plan,
unless
the
irs...
these
payments
are
made
to
the
irs.
the
debtor
has
no
discretion
not
to
make
the
payments
if
the
irs
says
we
are
not
going
to
designate
them
the
way
you
want,
then
it's
just
too
bad
for
the
debtor.
he
has
no
choice.
xxx.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
if
you
hold
that
the
bankruptcy
court
has
the
power
to--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
we
can
only
object
on
the
grounds--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that
is
right.
the
irs,
as
long
as
the
requirements
for
payment
of
taxes
that
are
specified
in
the
statute
are
satisfied,
if
the
plan
complies
with
that,
then
the
irs
can't
object.
and
if
there
are,
as
in
this
case
we
contend,
if
there
is
no
other
provision
in
the
plan
that
somehow
is
violative
of
law.
but
we...
the
irs
does
not
have
the
authority
to
just
veto
the
plan
because
it
doesn't
like
it.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
same
priority.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
same
priority.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
they
once
belonged
to
somebody.
they
once
belonged
to
us.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
there
was
a
trust
fund,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
rights
that
the
irs
has
in
that
trust
fund
as
long
as
it
exists.
in
fact,
as
long
as
the
trust
fund
can
be
identified
prior
to
bankruptcy,
those
funds
don't
go
into
the
estate
at
all.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
but
what's
happened
here
is
that
the
trust
funds
have
completely
been
dissipated
by
the
officers.
there
is
no
way
of
identifying
any
trust
funds
in
the
estate.
and
so
at
this
point
all
you
have
are
tax
liabilities.
there
is
no
longer
any
fund
to
which
the
irs
can
make
a
claim
of
its
own
money.
there
are
just
tax
liabilities.
and
congress
has
given
the
same
priority
to
both
of
these
kinds
of
tax
liabilities.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeal
held,
incorrectly
in
my
view.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
payments
that
are
being
made--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
would
guess
that
it
was
generated
after
the
petition
was
filed.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
think
the
irs
had
a
claim,
yes,
that
it
was
not
to
be
put
in
the
bankruptcy
estate
at
all,
but--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes.
and
if
that
happened,
of
course,
then
the
plan
would
only
be
paying
out
the
nontrust
fund
taxes
and
we
would
be
getting
paid
those
taxes
at
the
very
beginning,
instead
of
being
pushed
off
effectively
to
the
very
back
end
of
the
plan,
which
is
what
is
happening
here.
as
the
court
of
appeals
said
at
page
3(a)
of
its
opinion,
the
only
thing
that
turns
on
this
dispute
is
who
bears
the
risk
that
the
reorganization
will
not
be
fully
successful.
that
is,
that
all
the
payments
contemplated
in
the
plan
will
not
be
made.
is
it
the
irs
and
the
taxpaying
public,
or
is
it
the
responsible
officers
of
the
corporation?
the
designation
provision
that
the
court
imposed
here
works
to
the
advantage
of
these
officers
at
the
expense
of
the
government.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
i
mean
the
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
bankruptcy
court
ordered
the
irs
to
apply
the
payments
that
it
receives
first
to
all
of
the
trust
fund
liability
of
the
corporation.
and
only
after
the
trust
fund
liability
has
been
completely
satisfied,
which
in
turn
completely
eliminates
the
separate
liability
of
the
officers,
because
the
irs
only
collects
those
liabilities
once,
only
then
can
the
irs
go
and
apply
any
of
the
payments
to
the
nontrust
fund
liabilities.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
the...
what
the
bankruptcy
court
does
is
it
confirms
the
plan
of
reorganization.
and
then
the
debtor
continues
to
operate
the
company
within
the
parameters
of
the
plan.
the
plan
requires
that
certain
payments
be
made
on
a
schedule
to
the
irs.
so
each
time
a
payment
is
made
i
don't
think
the
debtor
has
to
go
to
the
court
for
approval.
it
has
already
been
set
up
by
the
plan,
and
in
fact
required
by
the
plan.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
you
follow
the
plan,
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
as
far
as
how
the
irs
allocates
payments?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
there
are
various
revenue
procedures
about
how
the
irs
allocates
this
money
first.
now,
the
only
purpose
of
the
designation
is
to
give
an
advantage
to
the
responsible
officers
of
the
corporation.
the
idea
is
so
that
the
partial
payments
that
have
been
made,
if
the
plan
ends
up
failing
and
all
the
payments
are
not
made,
will
be
used
so
as
to
minimize
those
officers'
personal
liability
under
section
6672.
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
debtor,
and
no
direct
difference
to
the
other
creditors,
how
these
payments
are
designated.
the
other
party
that
cares
about
it
is
the
irs,
because
what
the
designation
does
is
it
thwarts
the
government's
goal
of
ensuring
collection...
of
maximizing
the
collection
of
all
of
its
taxes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no.
there
is
a
provision
in
the
plan
that
the
irs
has
to
apply
it
to
the
trust
fund
taxes.
that
is
what
the
government
is
objecting
to,
the
bankruptcy
court's
power
to
include
such
a
provision
in
the
plan.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
believe
so.
well,
i'm
sorry,
what
do
you
mean
by
how,
how
the
payments
would
be
applied--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--there
is
a
court
order,
i
think
it's
incorporated
in
the
plan
in
at
least
one
case--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
at
what
stage
do...
you
mean
before
he
went
into
bankruptcy?
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
don't
know.
if
it's
before
the
confirmation
of
the
plan,
then
he
is
not
subject
to
a
court
order
requiring
him
to
make
that
payment.
he
is
also,
i
am
not
sure
he
would
be
paying
the
taxes
at
that
point
until
a
plan
had
been
confirmed,
because
the
other
creditors
would
be
negotiating
about
it.
so
i
am
not
sure
how
that
would
come
up.
i
think
the
irs...
if
it
was...
if
they
weren't
already
in
chapter
11,
i
think
the
irs'
view
would
be
that
it
would,
the
irs
would
have
the
power
to
allocate
those
payments.
and
if
you
want
to
do
that
as
a
voluntary
payment
at
that
stage,
then
the
irs
would
probably
say
well
just
wait
until
the
plan
is
confirmed.
but
once
they...
when
the
debtor
goes
into
chapter
11
there
is
an
automatic
stay
that
goes
into
effect
invoking
the
protection
of
the
bankruptcy
court
holding
off
all
the
creditors,
holding
them
at
bay
with
the
powers
of
the
court.
but
at
the
same
time
they
have
to
give
up
certain
rights.
and
one
of
the
rights
they
are
giving
up
is...
they
are
required
to
abide
by
a
plan
that
requires
full
payment
of
all
these
priority
taxes.
there
is
no
discretion
left
to
the
debtor
at
that
point
as
far
as
paying
the
taxes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
they
were...
they
were
under
a
legal
obligation
to
pay,
but
they
weren't
subject
to
a
court
order.
and
the
irs
has
taken
the
view,
as
i
said
before,
to
encourage
people
to
pay
without
having
to
go
to
court
or
to
seize
their
assets.
we
are
going
to
allow
them
to
designate
at
that
point.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
is
correct.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
is
correct.
there
never
should
have
been
a
trust
fund
liability--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that
would
benefit,
well--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
but
the
difference
is,
if...
you
are
suggesting
that
there
is
no
trust
fund
liability
in
the
bankruptcy
at
all--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
if
there
is
money
there
then
it's
not
part
of
the
bankruptcy,
and
it
is
being
paid
before
the
bankruptcy,
whether
you
want
to
say
it's
technically
or
really,
but
it
is
being
paid
outside
the
bankruptcy.
so
then
at
that
point
when
you
get
into
the
bankruptcy
the
government
is
going
to
get
the
nontrust
fund
tax
payments
in
short
order.
so--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--it's
not
a
question
of
the
priorities
changing.
i
mean,
it's
just...
at
that
point
it's
just
money
that
is
being
paid.
as
i
said,
it's
just
the
satisfaction
of
a
tax
liability.
there
is
no
longer
a
fund
that
belongs
to
the
government.
and
what
is
happening
here
is
that
the
money
is
being
applied
for
the
specific
purpose
of
getting
the
responsible
officers
off
the
hook.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
but
in
a
sense
the
tax
obligation
is
being
paid...
is
being
guaranteed,
shall
i
say,
by
the
government,
not
by
the
responsible
officers
any
more.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
don't
think
there
is
a
policy,
when
you
have
two
tax
liabilities,
that
one
has
to
be
paid
ahead
of
the
other,
because
dollars
are
dollars
to
the
irs.
what
there
is
a
policy
is
that
officers
of
the
corporation
are
not
supposed
to
borrow
without
permission
the
government's
money
in
order
to
run
the
corporation.
in
order
to
enforce
that
policy
there
is
a
special
provision
of
the
code,
section
6672,
that
is
supposed
to
act
as
a
very
strong
deterrent
to
having
officers
do
that.
and
it
imposes
a
personal
liability
on
them.
now,
hopefully--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--is
paid
on
time,
yes.
so
that--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
that
is
true,
but
again
that
is
because...
that's
not
the
corporation
making
a
payment
out
of
its
own
funds
to
the
government.
that's
the
corporation
holding
the
government's
money
in
trust,
and
it's
supposed
to
turn
it
over
to
the
government.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
if
the
officers
turn
over,
if
they
turn
over
the
trust
fund
to
the
government
they
are
not
on
the
hook
in
the
first
place.
but
what
has
happened
here
is
that
the
officers
have
ignored
their
statutory
duty.
they
have
taken
the
money,
spent
it
on
the
corporate
liabilities,
there
is
nothing
left,
the
whole
thing
has
been
thrown
into
bankruptcy.
and
now
the
government,
having
had
all
this
money
stolen
from
it
basically,
at
least
wants
to
be
able
to
allocate
the
payments
so
as
to
protect
the
public
fisc
in
a
way
to
maximize
the
government's
ability
to
collect
taxes.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
government's
policy
does
not
force
debtors
into
chapter
7
liquidation.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
disagree
with
the
premise
of
your
question,
justice
o'connor.
the
government
is
never
going
to
be
forced...
the
government's
designation
is
never
going
to
force
the
debtor
into
liquidation.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
debtor.
it
is
no
difference
to
the
debtor
how
the
irs
applies
these
payments.
it
is
no
difference
to
the
other
creditors.
the
only
thing
that
the
court
of
appeals
seized
on
here
was
the
notion
that
the
responsible
officers
would
try
to
negotiate
their
personal
liability
away
by
threatening
to
do
various
things
to
the
debtor,
maybe
to
force
it
into
liquidation,
if
the
irs
doesn't...
if
they
are
not
able
to
get
what
is
basically
a
personal
accommodation
from
the
irs
in
discharging
their
liability.
now
that
is
not
the
irs'
fault.
that
is
the
responsible
officers
fault.
and
i
would
say
a
few
things
about
that.
one,
we
really
think
it
is
very
inappropriate
for
the
bankruptcy
court
to
kind
of
become
an
accomplice
in
this
scheme
where
the
responsible
officers
take
the
government's
money
and
then
threaten
the
vitality
of
the
reorganization
in
order
to
get
out
from
under
their
liability.
secondly,
the
idea
of
chapter
11
is
that
there,
is
to
give
the
corporation
a
chance
to
keep
going
as
a
going
concern.
and
there
is
no
indication
at
all
anywhere
in
the
code
and
the
legislative
history
that
congress
thought
it
was
necessary
to
bribe
the
officers,
to
somehow
entice
the
officers
into
cooperating
with
this
endeavor.
they
are
the
officers
of
the
corporation;
they
are
trying
to
keep
their
corporation
going.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
either
before
bankruptcy
or
before
anyone
could
get
at
it
after
the
bankruptcy.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
they
should
have
paid
even
before
that,
probably.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
we
can
sue
them
now,
but--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--there
is
a
trustee
in
at
least
one
of
the
cases
there
is
a
trustee.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
don't
know
if
the
debtor
has
an
action
against
the
officers
or
not,
but
the
problem
with
the
irs
going
after
the
officers
directly
is
that
the
officers
can
string
out
the
litigation
for
quite
a
while
by
posting
a
bond,
litigating
it,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
it
will
take
a
while
for
the
government
to
collect
from
the
officers.
during
this
time
in
which
they
are
trying
to
collect
from
the
officers,
the
payments
out
of
the
organization
plan
will
be
being
applied
to
the
corporation's
liability
under
provision
of
the
plan
and
reducing
the
officers
separate
liability.
so
it
is
not
necessarily
a
useful
remedy
for
the
irs
to
go
after
the
officers.
second
of
all,
it
is
completely
counterproductive
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
thought
it
was
doing,
if
the
irs
is
going
to
run
out...
is
going
to
be
induced
by
this
to
run
out
and
go
after
the
officers
immediately,
that
is
not
going
to
help
the
reorganization
at
all--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
irs
could
agree,
yes.
this
case
is
about
whether
the
irs
can
be
forced
to
agree.
i
say
no.
i
would
like
to
reserve--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
it's
our
position
that--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that
is
right.
whether
it
is
appropriate,
and
whether
it
is
inconsistent
with
other
provisions
of
this
title.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
of
this
title.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
there
is
also...
well,
we
think
it
is
at
least
somewhat
inconsistent
with
the
general
idea
in
chapter
11,
which
is
specifically
embodied,
i
think,
in
section
1123(a)(4),
which
is
that
the
court
is
not
to
distinguish
among
claims
that
have
the
same
priorities.
so
we
do
think
there
are
some
inconsistencies
with
this
title
and
with,
of
course,
the
main
provision
that
requires
the
irs
to
be
paid
all
its
priority
taxes.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
make
a
couple
points.
first
of
all,
we
completely
disagree
with
the
notion
that
the
debtor
is
not
under
a
court
order
to
make
these
payments
under
the
plan.
if
he
doesn't
pay,
then
the
government
can
move
to
dismiss
the
plan
for
not...
the
chapter
11
proceeding
for
non-compliance.
that
is
under
section
1112(b)(8)
of
the
code.
and
if
for
some
reason
the
court
no
longer
has
retained
jurisdiction
over
the
case,
the
case
can
be
reopened
in
the
event
of
noncompliance
under
section
350
of
the
code.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
is
right.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
we
would
levy
on
them,
and
it
would
be
an
involuntary
payment
and
we
would
apply
it
where
we
wanted.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
and
the
protections
against
creditors
are
eliminated,
which
is
the
reason
why
the...
don't
forget
chapter
11
is
a
proceeding
that
is
invoked
by
the
debtor
to
protect
themselves
against
creditors,
not
one
that
the
irs
commences
in
order
to
collect.
second,
as
far
as
the
question
of
whether
this
kind
of
order
is
appropriate,
i
would
also
like
to
point
to
section
523
of
the
code,
which
specifically
does
not
allow
a
responsible
officer
to
be
discharged
for
a
6672
liability
in
his
personal
bankruptcy.
this
designation
provision
here
is
nothing
more
than
an
attempt
to
use
the
corporation
bankruptcy
to
discharge
his
6672
liability.
as
far
as
the
ability
of
the
irs
to
go
directly
against
the
officers--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
understand
it's
not
a
discharge
in
the
bankruptcy
sense.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
if
all
the
taxes
are
paid,
we
have
no
complaint.
but
the
idea
is
to
manipulate
the
corporate
bankruptcy
proceeding
in
such
a
way--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--i
just
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
footnote
on
page
3
of
our
reply
brief,
the
petition
stage,
which
discusses
the
practical
problems
with
going
against
the
officers
first.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
if
you're
talking
about
the
irs'
policy,
we
would
not
permit
that
designation.
we
would
view
that
as
under
the
involuntary.
