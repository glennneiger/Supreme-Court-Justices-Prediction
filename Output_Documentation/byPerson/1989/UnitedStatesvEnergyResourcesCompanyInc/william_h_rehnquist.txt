chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
first
this
morning
in
number
89-255,
united
states
against
energy
resources
co.--
mr.
horowitz.
chief
justice
rehnquist
all
the
lower
courts
upheld
that
conclusion,
didn't
they,
that--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--that
these
were
involuntary
payments.
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
the
question
we
granted
certiorari
on
is
whether
the
authority
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
allocate
tax
payments
under
these
circumstances.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
said
the
designation
provision
which
the
court
imposed.
you
mean
the
bankruptcy
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
how
would
you
describe
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
these
payments
are
being
made
out
of
the
bankruptcy
estate,
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
need
the
authority
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
make
them.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
just
follow
the
plan.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
plan
is
silent
on
this
point,
i
take
it,
as
to
how
the
irs
is
to
apply
the
payments?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
both
cases,
then,
there
is
a
provision...
the
plan
specifies
how
the
payments
are
to
be
made?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
the
payments
will
be
applied
by
the
irs.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
horowitz.
mr.
moss.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
debtor
is
somewhat
different.
there
is...
if
you
consider
the
plan
a
court
order,
the
debtor
is
under
a
court
order
to
pay
taxes
every
so
often,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
let's
break
it
down
a
minute,
mr.
moss.
take,
for
example,
the
plans
that
were
confirmed
in
this
case.
what
specifically
did
they
say
with
respect
to
the
payment
of
taxes
to
the
irs?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
they
say
anything
about--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--did
they
specify
dates
of
payment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay,
but
i'm
not
mentioning
the
government's
objection
right
now.
now,
is
there
any
penalty
or
sanction
that
attaches
to
the
debtor
in
this
case
if
it
fails
to
make
its
tax
payments,
other
than
simply
having
an
overdue
debt?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you've
been
backing
in
quite
a
bit.
let
me
ask
you
a
more
specific
question,
if
i
may.
chief
justice
rehnquist
could
the
irs
apply
to
the
bankruptcy
court
for
an
order
requiring
the
debtor
to
pay
according
to
the
plan?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
typical
situation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
typical
situation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
was
the
situation
in
these
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
in
those
cases
where
the
court
has
retained
jurisdiction,
could
the
irs
go
to
the
court
and
say
there
is
a
payment
due
here
that
was
not
made,
you
tell
the
debtor
to
make
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
would
be
at
least
a
different
situation
than
the
pre-bankruptcy.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
the
service
chooses
to
do
it
this
way.
that
would
be
different
from
pre-bankruptcy,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
to
order
a
taxpayer
to
pay?
what
sort
of
a
suit
would
that
be?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
say
there
is
no
liability
from
the
officers
to
the
debtor
for
their
having
misappropriated
the
trust
funds?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
moss.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
horowitz,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
horowitz.
the
case
is
submitted.
