justice
white
is
there
some
basis
in
law
for
the
irs
allocation?
they
say
they
have
the
right
to
allocate
it...
they
permit
the
taxpayer
to
do
it
with
voluntary
payments.
justice
white
well,
is
there
some
basis
in
law
for
that?
justice
white
you
consider
these
to
be
involuntary
payments?
justice
white
well,
is
it
your
claim
in
this
case
that
the
district
court
was,
that
the
bankruptcy
court
was
bound
to
respect
the
irs
policy
with
respect
to
involuntary
payments?
justice
white
but
do
you
think
there
is
some
legal...
some
legal
basis
that
you
argue
that
the
bankruptcy
court
was
wrong,
namely
that
it
should
have...
it
should
have
preserved
your
right
to
get
at
this...
at
the
officers?
justice
white
one
of
these
plans
actually
provided
for
the
prior
allocation
of
these
payments
to
the
ordinary
tax
liability.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
in
the
other
case
now,
the
other
case...
what
about
the
other
case?
justice
white
well,
there
was
a...
i
think
there
was
a
provision
in
the
plan,
wasn't
there,
to
pay--
justice
white
i
am
surprised
that
you
say
that
the
trust
fund
taxes
and
the
other
taxes
are
of
the
same
quality,
or
they--
justice
white
--same
priority,
is
that
what
you
say?
justice
white
but
the
trust
fund
taxes
belong
to
somebody.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
that's
right.
justice
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
the
equitable
power
of
the
bankruptcy
court
included
the
power
to
prefer
the
restoration
or
the
payment
of
these
trust
fund
taxes
first.
justice
white
there
is
no
regulation,
formal
regulation
relating
to
this
controversy,
is
there?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
no,
no,
no.
i
am
saying...
i
am
suggesting
there
is...
if
there
is
money
there,
that
the
duty
is
to
discharge
that
obligation
first,
because
it
isn't
really
a...
it's
somebody
else's
money,
it's
the
employees'
taxes
that
have
to
be
paid.
justice
white
mr.
horowitz,
before
bank
ruptcy,
the
trust
fund
was
dissipated
before
bankruptcy,
i
take
it.
justice
white
and
so
the
officers...
it
seems
to
me
the
officers'
obligation
matured
right
then.
they
should
have
paid
and
they
didn't.
justice
white
yes.
all
right,
well,
why
shouldn't
the,
why
shouldn't
you
be
able
to
just
sue
them
now,
outside
the
bankruptcy?
justice
white
and
why
shouldn't
the...
is
there
a
trustee
in
this
case,
or
these
cases?
justice
white
i
would
think
the
debtor
could
collect
from
the
officers
the
trust
fund
that
was
dissipated,
or
at
least
they
owe
somebody,
the
officers,
they
dissipated
the
trust
fund,
they
should
owe
somebody
right
now.
justice
white
that's
if
it
isn't
scheduled.
justice
white
could
you...
could
you
tell
me,
mr.
moss,
did
the
bankruptcy
court
indicate
any
reason
for
agreeing
with
the
request
to
allocate
these
payments
first
to
the
trust
fund
taxes?
justice
white
and
maybe
another
question
is
why
did
the
debtor
request
it
this
way?
justice
white
what
are
they?
justice
white
because
that
provision
would
reduce
their...
would
reduce
their
exposure.
justice
white
and
so
those
are...
that's
really
the
reason
in
both
of
these
cases
that
the
debtor
wants
to
have
the
tax
payments
applied
in
this
way.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
i
take
it
it's
really
immaterial
to
the
debtor,
i
suppose,
how
these
payments
are--
justice
white
--well,
after
all,
these
taxes
were
deducted
from
peoples'
paychecks,
weren't
they?
justice
white
and
they
were
used
before
bankruptcy
in
a
way
that
they
shouldn't
have
been
used
for.
justice
white
i
would
think...
i
would
think
other
creditors
would
have,
would
want
to
go
after
the
officers
rather
than
share
the
income
of
the
company
with...
with
the
government.
justice
white
well,
then
if
the
government
could
have
sued
the...
the
chapter
11
proceeding
doesn't
interfere
with
the
government's
right
to
sue
the--
justice
white
--the
officers
immediately.
justice
white
that
gets
it
out
of
the
officers,
and
i
would
think
the
other
creditors
would
want
to
have
the
plan
revised,
because
it
would
enhance
their
ability
to
be
paid
in
full
if
the
government
gets
their
taxes,
their
trust
fund
taxes
out
of
the
officers.
justice
white
well
can't
the
creditors
usually
profit
from
the
fact
that
a
debtor
has
a
surety,
has
a
guarantor?
