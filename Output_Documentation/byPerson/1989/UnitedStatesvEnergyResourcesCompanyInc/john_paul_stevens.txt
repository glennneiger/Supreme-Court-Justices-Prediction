justice
stevens
were
these
monies
generated
after
the
petition
was
filed
or
before
the
petition
was
filed?
justice
stevens
not
the
payments,
the
money
that
is
being
used
to
make
the
payments.
was
there
a
cash
surplus?
justice
stevens
because
if
it
was
generated
before,
then
it
would
have
had
to
go
to
the
irs.
justice
stevens
and
it
would
have
belonged
definitely
in
the
trust
fund--
justice
stevens
--under
your
theory
in
this
other
case.
justice
stevens
and
in
fact
they
had
a
duty,
i
suppose,
to
pay
the
trust
fund
obligation
first.
if
they
didn't
have
enough
money
to
pay
both
the
general
obligation
and
the
trust
fund
obligation,
their
duty
would
have
been
to
pay
the
trust
fund
obligation
first--
justice
stevens
--the
day
before
bankruptcy.
justice
stevens
and
that
of
course
is
just
for
the
benefit
of
the
officers
of
the
corporation
in
a
sense.
justice
stevens
it's
the
same,
the
same
mix
of
allocation
of
risks
as
you
have
the
day
after
the
bankruptcy.
justice
stevens
but
you
say
the
equities,
or
the
priorities
should
suddenly
change
the
day
the
bankruptcy
petition
is
filed.
justice
stevens
well,
and
for
discharging
a
tax
obligation
of
all
the
former
employees,
too.
justice
stevens
and
is
paid
before
a
general
corporate
tax,
if
that
is
also
due
and
owing.
if
you
have
two
to
pay,
you've
got
to
pay
the
trust
fund
first.
that's
the
whole
purpose
of
this,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
in
that
case
may
not
the
trustee
claim
that
is
a
preference?
justice
stevens
it
is
here.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
well,
that's
not
quite
right.
it's
not
a
discharge
in
the
bankruptcy
sense.
the
liability
is
paid.
justice
stevens
and
it
won't
be
discharged
if
it's
not
paid.
and
normally
when
something
is
discharged
in
bankruptcy
the
debt
is
extinguished
even
though
it
is
not
paid.
justice
stevens
then
there
is
no
need
for
a
discharge.
the
discharge
term
doesn't
even
arise
if
they
are
paid.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask...
may
i
ask
you
one
hypothetical?
supposing
the
court
order
directed
management
to
pay
$100,000
in
taxes
for
six
years
to
get
rid
of
all
of
these
obligations,
and
gave
management
discretion
as
to
which
ones
to
apply
to
the
trust
fund
obligations
and
which
not.
voluntary
or
involuntary?
