if
we
were
to
rule
against
you
in
this
case,
would
the
irs
in
future
reorganizations
have
the
capacity
to
object
to
a
plan
and
block
a
reorganization
on
the
grounds
that
it
objected
to
the
allocation?
justice
kennedy
right.
justice
kennedy
in
other
words,
as
a
creditor
it
could
not
object
to
the
approval
of
the
plan?
justice
kennedy
but
it
is
a
policy
of
the
government,
is
it
not,
to
accelerate
payments
of
the
trust
fund?
your
whole...
you
whole
argument
here
is
that
this
is
a
vital
obligation
that
ought
to
be
discharged,
and
that's...
whether
or
not
there
are
any
trust
monies
left,
the
policy
still
remains,
and
the
bankruptcy
court's
order
accords
with
that
policy.
justice
kennedy
yes,
but
the
reason
for
that
is
so
that
the
trust
fund
obligation
is
paid.
justice
kennedy
suppose
you
had
a
reorganization
and
the
officers
said
we
are
willing
to
make
this
company
run,
but
we
want
to
make
sure
that
our
trust
fund
obligation
is
discharged
first
by
the
corporation.
could
the
irs
say
well,
in
looking
at
all
the
circumstances
we
agree?
