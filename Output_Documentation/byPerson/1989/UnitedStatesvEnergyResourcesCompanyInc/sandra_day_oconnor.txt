justice
o'connor
mr.
horowitz,
did
the
bankruptcy
court
have
the
power
to
approve
these
plans
over
the
objections
of
the
irs?
justice
o'connor
does
the
irs
have
an
express
policy
in
its
manual
to
the
effect
that
it
will
comply
with
orders
of
the
bankruptcy
court?
justice
o'connor
--mr.
horowitz,
do
you
think
the
government
will
be
more
likely
to
collect
all
its
taxes
if,
by
insisting
on
this
policy,
it
has
the
effect
of
forcing
the
debtor
into
a
chapter
7
liquidation
instead
of
chapter
11?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
could.
i
mean,
the
argument
of
the
other
side,
of
course,
is
that
the
ability
of
the
bankrupt
estate
to
be
reorganized
and
carry
on
as
an
ongoing
business
may
turn
in
part
on
the
agreement
of
how
these
taxes
are
to
be
allocated.
and
if
that
is
the
case,
and
if
the
government
declines
to
go
along
with
that
and
thereby
causes
the
reorganization
to
fail,
is
the
government
going
to
be
more
likely
to
collect
all
its
taxes?
