justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
suppose...
the
doctor
here
testified
that,
dr.
jambura,
in
his
professional
judgment
there
had
been
some
kind
of
abuse
of
the
child.
would
the
statement
made
by
the
child
to
the
doctor
have
been
admissible,
in
your
judgment,
if
the
judge
had
given
an
instruction
to
the
jury
that
it
is
not
admitted
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted
in
the
statement
but
rather...
merely
as
basis
for
the
doctor's
professional
opinion?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
done
all
the
time
with
a
lot
of
hearsay
statements.
justice
stevens
but,
see,
the
witness
being
confronted,
then,
would
be
the
doctor,
not
the
child.
because
you're
asking
the
doctor
for
the
basis
for
the
doctor's
expert
opinion,
which
did
get
in,
which
wasn't
objected
to,
that...
namely,
that
the
child
had
been
physically
abused
and
so
forth.
and
one
of
the
things
the
doctor
no
doubt
relied
on
is
that
the
child
told
him
he
was
abused...
told
him
that
she
was
abused.
but
you
think
that
would...
that
would
all
be
inadmissible,
even
under
that
circumstance?
justice
stevens
but
the
issue,
i
suppose,
is
which
is
the
witness
that
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
confront,
the
doctor
or
the
child?
justice
stevens
well,
they're
both
saying
he's
guilty.
justice
stevens
the
doctor
says
it,
too.
justice
stevens
yes.
may
i
ask
you
another
question
now
that
i've
got
you
interrupted?
did
you
try
this
case?
justice
stevens
what
sentence
did
the
defendant
get?
justice
stevens
on
each.
and
were
they
concurrent
sentences?
justice
stevens
what
interest
does
the
defendant
have
in
the
outcome
of
this
appeal?
justice
stevens
xxx.
were
you
in
the
appellate
proceedings
before
the
idaho
supreme
court?
