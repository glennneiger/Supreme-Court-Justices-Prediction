we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-260,
idaho
against
laura
lee
wright.
general
jones.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
was
there
a
dismissal
on
the...
by
the
local
prosecutor
after
the
remand
from
the
supreme
court
of
idaho,
and
then
that
dismissal
was
vacated?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
case
is
presently
pending
for
retrial
in
the
idaho
district
court,
depending
on
the
outcome
of
the
case
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
unless
there
are
further
questions
from
the
court,
why
don't
you
proceed
to
the
merits
of
the
case,
mr.
jones?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--very
well,
general
jones.
mr.
bryson?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
bryson,
what
you
refer
to
as
these...
this
corroboration
resembles
to
a
certain
extent
a
harmless
error
analysis.
chief
justice
rehnquist
didn't
prove
much.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
kehne.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
kehne,
anybody
who's
tried
lawsuits
knows
that
you
have
to
lead
to
a
certain
extent
to
get
the
witness
to
focus
on,
you
know,
what...
what's
the
subject
of
the
inquiry,
rather
than
whether
it's
raining
or
sunny
outside.
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
you
could
have
cross-examined
the
doctor
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
could
ask
him
why
he
used
these
leading
questions,
and
you
could
also
argue
to
the
jury,
perhaps
not
as
effectively
as
with
a
videotape,
that
this
is
something
that
can
produce
untruthful
answers.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
this...
was
it
the
same
judge
who
conducted
the
voir
dire
of
the
child
in
person
and
who
later
admitted
the
declaration
of
the
doctor...
the
declaration
to
the
doctor?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
at
the
time
the
trial
judge
admitted
the
declaration,
he
must
not
have
felt
that
this
witness
was...
or
the
declarant
was
incompetent?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
i
would
think
it
would
be
a
very
strange
judge
who
would
admit
a
statement
to
a
doctor
by
a
witness
whom
he
regarded
as
incompetent
or
by
a
declarant
whom
he
regarded
as
incompetent.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kehne.
general
jones,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
jones.
the
case
is
submitted.
