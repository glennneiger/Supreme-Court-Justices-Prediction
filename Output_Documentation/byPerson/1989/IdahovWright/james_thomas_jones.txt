mr.
james
thomas
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
we
are
here
today
because
the
idaho
supreme
court
has
misread
the
requirements
of
the
confrontation
clause
of
the
sixth
amendment.
by
imposing
three
rigid
preconditions
to
the
admissibility
of
hearsay
statements
of
unavailable
child
witnesses,
the
court
has
made
it
almost
impossible
to
get
this
kind
of
evidence
into
the
fact-finding
process.
in
essence,
the
court
has
held
that
the
confrontation
clause
requires
the
hearsay
declarations
of
child
sex
abuse
witnesses
to
be
videotaped,
the
product
of
non-leading,
open-ended
questions
and
elicited
by
an
interviewer
with
no
preconception
of
what
the
child
should
be
disclosing.
the
state
of
idaho
submits
that
this
three-part
test
cannot
be
sustained
by
a
reasonable
reading
of
the
confrontation
clause,
and
that
it
is
in
fact
in
conflict
with
the
purpose
of
the
clause
to
advance
the
accuracy
of
the
truth
determining
process
in
criminal
trials.
in
its
effort
to
protect
the
confrontation
rights
of
the
defendant,
the
court
has
made
it
extremely
difficult
to
get
reliable
hearsay
statements
made
by
child
victims
and
witnesses
before
the
trial
courts.
and
of
course
that
is
evidence
that
is
critical
in
many
of
these
cases.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
yes.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
the
conviction
for
the
lewd
conduct
with
the
younger
daughter
was
reversed.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
the
conviction
for
lewd
conduct
with
the
older
daughter,
the
five-and-a-half-year
old,
was
not
appealed
from.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
no,
your
honor,
the
second
count
was
not
dismissed.
laura
lee
wright
is
in
the
state
penitentiary
on
her
conviction
on
the
count
of
molesting
the
five-and-a-half-year
old.
the
count
of
molesting
the
two-and-a-half-year
old
is
before
the
court.
the
conviction
was
reversed
on
that
count.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
that
is
the
count
that
is
before
the
court
at
this
point.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
oh,
i
see
what
you're
getting
at.
after...
after
the
court
granted
certiorari,
we
found
out
that
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
counsel
had
gone
into
the
court
and
had
stipulated
for
a
dismissal
in
exchange
for
an
agreement
that
had
to
do
with
termination
of
the
parental
rights
of
mrs.
wright
to
the
two-and-a-half-year
old
daughter.
the
matter
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
trial
court.
there
was
a
hearing--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
and
then,
after
a
hearing,
the
charge
that
was
dismissed
was
reinstated.
it
was
on
the
ground
of
inadvertence
under
rule
60
of
the
idaho
rules--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--the
count
was
dismissed
before
cert.
was
granted.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
and
it
was
after
cert.
was
granted
that
we
found
out
that
the
charge
had
been
dismissed.
it
was
not
dismissed
by
our
office,
but
by
the
county
prosecuting
attorney
and
by
defense
counsel.
we
were
not
notified.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
yes,
he
had
the
authority
to
do
that.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
well,
we...
we
went
into
the--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--let's
see.
the
dismissal
took
place,
i
believe,
in
november
of
last
year.
and
cert.
was
granted
after
the
dismissal,
but
before
the
charge
was
reinstated.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
right.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
we
believe
that...
that,
while
there
was
still
the
ability
to
go
into
the
court
to
seek
reconsideration
of
the
dismissal
order,
and
while
we
were
operating
under
the
inadvertent
impression
that
the
case
was
still
pending,
that
the
dismissal
was
not
final.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
i--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
the
count
was
still
pending
at
the
time
we
filed
our
petition.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
there
was
no
response.
the
court
requested
the
response
to
the
petition,
but
none
was
filed.
now,
had
there
been
one,
presumably
all
of
us
would
have
known
that
the
case
had
been...
that
the
dismissal
order
had
been
made.
but
we
were
not
advised.
the
counsel
for
the...
for
wright
was
requested
on
at
least
one
occasion
to
file
the
response.
none
was
filed.
i
think
it
was
after
the
second
request
for
a
response
that
the
case
was
dismissed.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
the
dismissal
was
without
prejudice,
which
would
have
given
the
prosecutor,
had
it
wished,
the
ability
to
go
ahead
and--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--that
is
correct.
we
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
the
dismissal
had
been
made
without
prejudice,
and
that
certainly
the
understanding
was
that
that
could
have
been
refiled.
it
was
primarily
an
exchange
of
getting
the
case
resolved
so
that
they
could
terminate
the
parental
rights
of
the
mother.
and
as
i
take
it
now,
the
question
of
whether
parental
rights
have
been
fully
terminated
depends
on
whether
this
court
affirms
or
reverses.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
thanks,
mr.
chief
justice.
essentially,
we're
saying
that
the
idaho
supreme
court,
in
looking
at
the
case,
had
obtained
the
misimpression
that
instead
of
looking
at
all
of
the
circumstances
to
see
whether
the
hearsay
statement
was
admissible,
only
focused
on
three
circumstances.
that
is,
whether
leading
questions
had
been
involved,
whether
there
was
a
videotaping
of
the
interview
between
the
young
girl
and
the
pediatrician
and
whether
he
had
a
preconception
of
what
was
going
to
be
disclosed.
i'd
like
to
go
into
basically
the...
the
testimony
that's
at
issue.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
i'm
going
to
cover
that,
justice
white.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
because...
in
fact,
i
was
doing
a
little
bit
of
quick
research
during
the
previous
argument.
the
older
girl,
the
five-and-a-half-year
old,
jeannie,
testified
at
trial
as
to
the
acts
that
had
been
carried
out...
the
sexual
acts
that
had
been
carried
out
against
her
and
against
her
younger
sister,
by
both
of
the
defendants.
a
number
of
witnesses,
a
couple
of
police
officers,
three
doctors
and
a
social
worker
came
in
and
essentially
verified
that
jeannie
had
told
them
basically
the
same
thing
during
interview
sessions
shortly
after
the
sexual
abuse
became
known.
the
younger
girl,
kathy,
was
found
by
the
trial
judge
to
be
not
capable
of
communicating
to
the
jury
and
was
not
permitted
to
testify.
however,
dr.
jambura,
a
pediatrician,
testified
as
to
statements
that
had
been
made
to
him
by
kathy
during
an
examination
that
took
place
after
she
was
taken
from
wright's
home,
a
day
after.
during
the
course
of
the
examination
he
checked
out
the
medical
situation,
and
found
that
there
had
been
some
abrasions
in
the
vagina.
and
after
that
he
asked
her
some
questions.
and
four
of
those
are
relevant
today.
the
first
question
was:
"do
you
play
with
daddy"?
--referring
to
giles,
the
co-defendant.
"does
daddy
play
with
you?
"
"does
daddy
touch
you
with
his
pee-pee?
"
and
at
this
point,
in
order
to
aid
in
answering
the
question,
he
drew
a
picture,
and
she
added
a
penis
to
it.
and
the
final
question
was:
"do
you
touch
his
pee-pee"?
after
making
no
initial
response
to
the
last
question,
the
girl
said,
"daddy
does
do
this
with
me,
but
he
does
it
a
lot
more
with
my
sister
than
with
me.
"
her
responses
were
admitted
by
the
trial
judge
under
idaho's
residual
hearsay
exception
on
the
court's
finding
that
they
were
reliable
and
that
their
circumstantial
guarantees
of
trustworthiness
were
equivalent
to
statements
permitted
under
some
of
the
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exemptions.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
the
trial
judge,
in
the
presence
of
the
attorneys
and
the
parties
conducted...
but
out
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
conducted
a
voir
dire
examination
and
asked
the
young
girl,
kathy,
the...
three
years
old
at
that
time,
a
number
of
questions,
and
at
the
time
of
trial
he
determined
that
she
was
not
capable
of
communicating
with
the
jury
and
made
that
determination
under
idaho
law--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--the
child
was
not
incompetent.
the
judge
did
not
hold
that.
the
judge
held
that
her
testimony
in
the
courtroom
setting
would
not
have
been
useful,
that
she
could
not
have
communicated
to
the
jury,
and
any--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--well,
under
idaho
law
there
are
two
parts
of
incompetence.
number
one,
inability
to
communicate
with
the
jury.
number
two,
which
the
court
did
not
find,
inability
to
understand
what
you're
talking
about.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
at
that
time,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
right,
the
judge
was
making--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
most
of
the
courts
have
dealt
with
those
kinds
of
statements,
but
there
have
been
two
circuit
decisions...
nelson
against
farrey
and
u.s.
against
dorian,
seventh
and
eighth
circuit
cases,
where
a
child
has
not
come
in,
been
essentially
determined
incompetent
to
testify
in
the
courtroom
setting,
but
their
hearsay
statements
were
admitted
as
being
reliable
at
the
time
that
they
were
made.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
the
court
didn't
specifically
say,
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant.
the
court
essentially
said
that
in
the
courtroom
setting
this
particular
child,
based
upon
his
voir
dire
at
that
time,
would
not
be
productive,
that--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--it's
a
possibility.
there
was
no
determination
by
the
judge
as
to
the
particular
effect
that
the
parents
or
the
defendants
would
have
on
that
child,
whether
the
child
would
be
traumatized.
the...
the
inquiry
was
not
so
much
the
trauma
to
be
visited
on
the
child,
but
the
ability
of
the
child
to
relate
at
that
particular
time
and
place
the
facts
that--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--well,
it
does
to
a
degree,
because
here
we
were
looking
at
a
particular
statement
made
by
this
child
in
an
interview
session
between
the
child
and
a
pediatrician,
and
we
were
not
looking
at
the
total
range
of
everything
that
the
child
said.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
well,
the
court
found
that
the
child
would
not
be
competent
to
relate
facts
in
the
courtroom
setting.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
in
the
courtroom
setting.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
the
judge
did,
however,
look
very
carefully
at
all
circumstances
surrounding
the
making
of
the
statement
to
the
pediatrician,
and
he
said
this
statement,
when
considering
it
in
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
is
a
reliable
statement
and
should
be
let
in.
he
made
a
distinction
between...
between
competence
and
reliability.
i'd
like
to
just
point
out
the
things
that
he
looked
at
to
determine
that
the
statement
was
reliable.
he
said,
number
one,
that
there
was
physical
evidence
to
corroborate
that
sex
abuse
occurred.
number
two,
that
there
was
no
motive
for
the
two-and-half-year-old
younger
daughter
to
make
up
a
story
of
this
nature.
number
three,
the
nature
of
the
statements
themselves
as
to
the
sexual
abuse
are
such
that
they
fall
outside
the
general
believability
that
a
child
could
make
them
up,
or
would
make
them
up.
number
four,
that
the
younger
daughter
was
in
the
custody
of
the
defendants
at
the
time
the
injuries
occurred.
number
five,
that
the
older
daughter
testified
that
it
was
the
younger
daughter's
mother
and
father
who
were
the
perpetrators
of
the
sexual
abuse.
and
number
six,
that
the
perpetrators
were
well-known
to
the
victim.
he
said,
looking
at
that
statement
in
that
context,
the
statement
is
reliable.
it
meets
the
reliability
requirements
of
the
ohio
against
roberts
case,
and
therefore
it
should
be
admitted.
he
also
found
that
essentially
she
was
unavailable,
and
i
would
submit--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--certainly,
if
it
had--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--no.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
companion
case--
mr.
james
thomas
jones
--right.
in
the
decision
in
the
companion
case,
giles,
they
said
the
testimony
was
properly
admitted.
that
was
three
months
prior.
no
problem
for
hearsay
purposes.
the
only
difference
between
this
case
is,
they
looked
at
it
from
the
confrontation
clause
standpoint
and
said,
well,
it
was
fine
for
hearsay
rules
but
it's
not
fine
for
confrontation
clause
purposes.
if
i
might,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
james
thomas
jones
thanks,
mr.
chief
justice.
we're
not
here
to
suggest
that
the
court
permit
all
hearsay
statements
of
young
children
in,
or
that
unreliable
statements
be
permitted
in
evidence.
what
we're
asking
is
that
the
trial
court
be
permitted
to
look
at
all
of
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
making
of
the
statement.
and
if
the
court
finds
that
there
are
guarantees
of
trustworthiness,
as
required
both
by
roberts
and
by
the
idaho
rules
of
evidence,
that
the
statement
go
in.
in
this
case,
we
had
a
young
girl
who
was
taken
out
of
the
home
of
the
defendant.
the
next
day
she
was
examined.
the
doctor
found
vaginal
injuries
that
occurred
two
or
three
days
before,
at
the
time
she
was
in
the
custody
of
both
of
the
defendants.
at
the
time
the
doctor
finished
his
medical
examination,
he
asked
her
some
questions.
when
he
drew
a
figure,
she
added
a
penis
to
it...
a
two-and-a-half-year-old
girl
doesn't
necessarily
know
what
a
penis
is.
she,
in
response
to
questions,
volunteered
a
statement
that
daddy
does
this
to
me,
but
he
does
it
to
my
sister
a
lot
more
than
me.
there
was
corroborating
testimony
in...
over
and
above
those
circumstances
from
the
older
girl
to
talk
about
the
sexual
abuse
visited
on
both
of
the
girls.
and
in
addition
to
all
that,
in
the
giles
case,
the
idaho
supreme
court
said
this
statement...
by
a
majority
opinion,
they
said
this
statement
is
reliable.
and
they
gave
it
their
stamp
of
approval.
the
only
reason
we're--
