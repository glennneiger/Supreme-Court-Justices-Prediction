justice
white
and
when
you
filed
your
petition,
the...
the
count
was
still--
justice
white
--exactly
and...
and
at
the
time
the
response
to
the
petition
was
filed?
justice
white
xxx...
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
are
we...
must
we
assume
that
these
witnesses
were
unavailable?
justice
white
are
you
going
to
get
to
that?
all
right.
justice
white
why
was
she...
why
was
she
unavailable
for...
for
testifying
in
trial?
justice
white
you
mean
that
child
was
just
an
incompetent
witness?
is
that
it?
justice
white
competence
was...
based
on...
was
it
based
on
the
fact
that
testifying
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant
would
render...
that
she
just
would
be
incapable
of
doing
that
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant?
justice
white
do
you
suppose
he
would
have
come
out
if...
if...
if
the...
if...
would
that
child
have
been
competent
to
testify
under
the
maryland
procedure?
justice
white
and
the...
the
idaho
supreme
court
proceeded
on
the
basis
that...
that
if
the
procedures
they
thought
should
have
been
followed
had
been
followed,
that
the
statements
perhaps
could
be
admitted--
justice
white
--so
they
didn't...
they
didn't
decide
on
the
basis
that
that...
of
incompetency?
justice
white
and
that's
the
decision
we're
reviewing,
is--
justice
white
do
you
disagree
with
what
the
court
seems
to
have
indicated,
that
if...
that
if
these
deficiencies
hadn't
existed,
if
there
had
to
have
been
videotape,
no
leading
questions
and
no
preconception,
that
the
statement
could
have
been
admitted?
justice
white
what
would...
what
would
the
presence
of
those...
what
would
the
presence
of
those
procedures
have
done
that
would
make
you
say
it
would
be
all
right?
justice
white
it
would...
really
just
reliability,
isn't
it?
justice
white
and
we
do
judge
this
case
on
the
basis
that
the
witness
is
unavailable?
justice
white
um-hum.
justice
white
so
you
say
that
even
if
this...
you
say
that
as
long
as
there
was
a...
that
the...
that
there
was
this
indicia
of
reliability...
sufficient
indicia
of
reliability,
that
the
confrontation
clause
would
not
be
violated
by
admitting
the
testimony?
justice
white
even
though...
even
though
it
would
be
sort
of
a
new
sort
of
a
holding?
justice
white
xxx
bit
more
than
just
the
inability
to
testify
in
a
courtroom,
isn't
it?
justice
white
i
thought
you
had
settled
that
we...
just
to
the
contrary
earlier
in
your
argument,
that
both
sides
had
agreed
that
this
person
was
unavailable
but
not
that
the
witness
was
incompetent
in
the
technical
sense?
justice
white
and
did
you
make
the
suggestions
that...
of
what
might...
what
might
be
required,
the
videotaping,
the--
justice
white
--[inaudible]
insist
on
there
being
a
trial
run
before
they...
with
the
defendant
in
the
room?
justice
white
well,
you
don't
think
that
the
defendant...
that...
you
wouldn't
say
the
defendant
had
to
be
present
at
the
interview?
justice
white
but
you
don't...
you
don't...
you
wouldn't
insist...
you
wouldn't
insist
that
after
that,
that
you
actually
have
the...
a
pretrial
confrontation
between
the
victim
and
the
defendant
to
see
if
the
defendant...
to
see
if
the
victim
really
is
unavailable
to
testify?
