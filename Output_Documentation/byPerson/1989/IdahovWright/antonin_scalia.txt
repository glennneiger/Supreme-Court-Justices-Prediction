justice
scalia
sort
of
a
contingent
future
case
or
controversy
in
a
way.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
yes,
but
that...
and
that's
what
incompetence
to
testify
usually
means.
it
means
that
the
child
is
too
young
to
give
a
coherent
account,
that
the
child's
understanding
of
questions
and...
and
sense
of
reality
to
frame
the
responses
is
inadequate.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
it's
in
a
courtroom
setting
or
not,
does
it?
justice
scalia
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
at
that
stage.
i'm
talking
about
the
stage
the
judgment
of
incompetence
to
testify
is
made.
i
had
thought
that
usually
that
means,
when
a
court
makes
that
determination,
that
this
child
is...
is
just...
or
it
could
be
an
incompetent
person.
that
the
person
doesn't
understand
questions,
cannot
intelligently
respond
to
answers.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
courtroom
trauma,
that
he
could
do
it
in
another
setting
but
can't
do
it
in
a
courtroom.
now,
which
did
your
court
find
here?
justice
scalia
just
in
the
courtroom
setting?
well,
that's--
justice
scalia
--well,
that's
not
really
incompetence
as
i
normally
understand
it,
incompetence
to
testify.
justice
scalia
what
page
is
that
[inaudible]
on?
justice
scalia
did
it
say
automatically--
justice
scalia
--or
was
it
just
one
of
the
factors?
don't
you
think
it
is
a
proper
factor
in
deciding
whether
a
prior
examination
was
reliable
or
not,
whether
the
person
had
an
objective
in
mind
in
making
the
examination?
justice
scalia
well,
no,
but
he
was
looking
for
child
abuse.
justice
scalia
oh,
it's
a
lot
more
reliable
if
the
child
blurts
out
something
relating
to
sex
abuse
in
a...
in
a
conversation
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
subject,
where
the
doctor
was
trying
to
find
something
else.
justice
scalia
and
she
said,
you
know,
daddy...
daddy
did
something
else
to
me.
that
would...
wouldn't
that
be
more
reliable?
justice
scalia
that's
right.
justice
scalia
but
without
saying
that
that
disqualifies
it
automatically,
don't
you
agree
that
that
renders
it
less
reliable
than
the
same
information
elicited
in
the
different
context?
justice
scalia
we
haven't...
we
have
used
language
like
that,
though.
how
do
you
explain
that
language
in
our
cases?
we
have
talked
about
corroboration
as
being
one
of
the
elements
that
will
allow
in
hearsay.
justice
scalia
so
you
say
there's
a
difference
between
the
kind
of
indicia
of
reliability
which
attend
the
exception
itself
and
corroboration
by
just
other
accumulated
evidence?
justice
scalia
it's
not
an
easy
set
of
opinions
to
figure
out,
mr.
kehne.
justice
scalia
well,
of
course
a
video--
justice
scalia
--a
videotape
wouldn't
show
you
that
either,
unless
it's
a
very
unusual
videotape,
maybe
a
split
screen
with
one
half
of
it
on
the
questioner
and
the
other
half
on
the
child.
you're
talking
about
nonverbal
suggestions
made.
that
wouldn't
come
out
on
the
video.
what
kind
of
a
videotape
are
you
talking
about?
justice
scalia
with
one
showing
the
questioner
and
the
other
half
showing
the--
justice
scalia
--the
person
being
interrogated?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
you
say
that
that's
the
way
you
do
it
in
idaho
for...
for--
justice
scalia
mr.
kehne--
justice
scalia
--mr.
kehne,
what
happens
if
you...
you
have
this...
this
videotape
and
the
child
does
indeed
say
this
but
the
defendant
says
the
child
hasn't
been
with
me
for
a
year
now.
let's
say
it's
my
son,
and
i
say
all
of
this
has
been
planted
in
the
child's
mind.
the
child
does
believe
it,
as
you
say,
but
it...
the
child's
been
led
to
believe
it
by
the
parents.
now,
how
does
the
defendant
possibly
establish
that
if
he
cannot
place
the
child
in
front
of
the
jury?
does
the
defendant
have
a
shot
for
a
private
videotaping
at
which
he
can
get
a
social
worker
on
his
side
to
try
to
probe
with
the
same
kind
of
leading
questions
as
to
whether,
if
indeed
you
can
find
out
that
kind
of
thing,
whether
the
other
parent
planted
this
thought
in
the
child's
mind.
what
is...
what
is
the
defense
against
that
kind
of
activity?
justice
scalia
how
can
you
say
that
there's
any
inherent
indicia
of
reliability
and
yet
at
the
same
time
say
what
you've
just
told
me?
there
are
inherent
indicia
of
reliability
but,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
we
can't
really
tell
whether
the
child
knows
this
because
it
happened
or
knows
it
because
somebody
has
persuaded
him
that
it--
what
kind
of
inherent
reliability
is
that?
justice
scalia
well,
i
wouldn't
like
to
be
a
defendant
in
such...
in
such
circumstances.
i
get
no
shot
at
the
child.
the
child
is...
is
excluded
from
the
trial,
and
a
videotape
is
put
on,
and...
and
all
i
can
do
is
i
can
just
ask
the
jury
to
believe
that
the
child's
been
fed
all
of
this
by
some
malicious
person
over
the
past
year,
and
i
get
no...
no
chance
to
prove
it
in
any
other
fashion.
right?
and
that...
that's
the
system
you...
you
say
is
constitutional.
