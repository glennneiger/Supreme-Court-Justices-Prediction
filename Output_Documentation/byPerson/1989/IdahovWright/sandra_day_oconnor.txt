justice
o'connor
well,
isn't
that
tantamount
to,
quote,
"incompetence
of
a
witness"
as
that
term
is
normally
understood?
justice
o'connor
but
either
one
means
that
the
witness
is
not
able
to
be
called
as
a
witness
in
a
trial.
justice
o'connor
and
we
take
the
case
on
that
assumption,
that
this
young
child
had
been
determined
not
to
be
someone
who
could
be
called
to
testify
at
trial?
justice
o'connor
but
you're
making
the
argument
that
that
same
child
at
an
earlier
time,
outside
the
courtroom
setting,
would
be
competent,
in
effect,
and
that
her
testimony
should
come
in
under
some
hearsay
exception?
justice
o'connor
is
that
right?
is
that
your
argument?
justice
o'connor
now,
have
most
courts
held
that
if
a
witness
is
found
to
be
incompetent
that
the
only
kind
of
out-of-court
statements
that
could
come
in
would
be
what
we
call
the
excited
utterance,
or
res
gestae
statements?
justice
o'connor
but
it...
it's
not
what
we'd
call
an
excited
utterance
or
a
res
gestae--
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you...
do
you
think
here
that
the
out-of-court
statements
fall
within
the
state's
residual
hearsay
exception?
justice
o'connor
and
would
you
take
the
position
that
anytime
it
falls
within
such
an
exception
that
it
automatically
can
come
in
under
the
confrontation...
despite
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
o'connor
is
it
a
firmly
rooted
exception
if
it's
in
the
residual
exception
category?
justice
o'connor
well,
what...
what's
the
effect
of
the
finding
that
the
witness
is
incompetent
to
testify?
justice
o'connor
mr.
bryson,
i'm
sorry
to
interrupt
again
and
to
ask
a
question
on
this,
but
it
troubles
me,
and
i'm
going
to
do
it
anyway.
what
if
the
finding
of
the
trial
court
is
in
the
traditional
sense
of
incompetence
of
a
witness
to
testify?
would
you
be
here
urging
that
if
you
find
all
these
outside
things,
then
that
testimony
ought
to
come
in?
justice
o'connor
and
do
we
know
for
sure
what
the
finding
was
here?
justice
o'connor
--well,
mr.
kehne,
it
obviously
is
desirable,
if...
if
the
testimony
can
be
obtained
that
way.
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
federal
constitution
requires
it?
justice
o'connor
despite
any
other
indicia
of
reliability
that
a
particular
case
might
pose?
justice
o'connor
and
in
examining
children
i
think
almost
all
states
and
the
federal
rules
as
well
would
allow
the
use
of
leading
questions
in
examining
child
witnesses,
would
they
not?
justice
o'connor
so
you
take
the
position
that
if
a
child
witness
is
unable
to
testify
in
a
courtroom
in
the
presence
of
a
defendant,
that
it
depends
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
whether
the
out-of-court
statements
may
come
in?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
kehne,
the
finding
of
the
court
that
we
have
here
is
basically
the
statement
by
the
court:
"is
there
any
disagreement
that
she
is
not
capable
of
communicating
to
a
jury?
"
that
was
the
question
the
trial
judge
asked.
both
counsel
agreed
that
she
was
not
capable
of
communicating
to
the
jury.
what
is
the
nature
of
that
finding?
is
it...
is
it
that
she's
not
able
to
respond
to
questions
and
make
observations?
justice
o'connor
so
you
disagree
with
the
characterization
of
that
finding
by
counsel
on
the
other
side?
