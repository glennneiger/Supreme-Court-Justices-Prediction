mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
two
general
responses
to
our
state
attorney
general
and
mr.
bryson.
first
of
all
i'd
like
to
talk
about
this
notion
that
we
can
cure
a
confrontation
violation
by
corroboration.
i
would
submit,
as
professor
burger
pointed
out
very
eloquently
for...
for
her
brief
for
the
aclu,
that
all
the
corroboration
in
the
world
will
not
cure
a
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause.
if
we
take
the
state's
argument
to
its
extreme,
then
we
will
have
trial
judges
saying,
i
believe
this
defendant
is
guilty
and
i
am
sure
of
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
therefore,
it
is
okay
for
me
to
allow
in
hearsay
evidence
of
robbery
victims,
eye
witnesses,
anybody
else
that
the
state
says
we
cannot
procure
today.
they
are
unavailable
to
us.
and
according
to
the
state's
theory,
this
court
should
affirm
because
the
trial
judge
had
a
lot
of
other
evidence
to
corroborate
that
determination
that
yes,
well,
it
doesn't
matter,
this
defendant's
guilty
anyway.
and
i
don't
think
this
court's
opinions
have
ever
suggested
that
that
could
be
the
case.
it
may
be
that
we
can
imagine
some
way
of
conducting
criminal
trials
that
will
lead
to
just
as
reliable
results
as
the
way
we
do
it,
but
the
fact
is,
in
this
country
we
do
it
by
allowing
defendants
to
confront
their
accusers.
it
doesn't
matter--
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
--if
it
is
corroboration
surrounding
the
circumstance
of
the
making
of
the
statement.
let
me
submit
to
the
court
that
the
true
standard
is
whether
or
not
confrontation
and
cross-examination
would
be
useful
to
the
accused
and
would
be
useful
to
the
jury.
if
the
truth
or
falsity
of
the
statement
is
determined
solely
by
the
nature
of
its
making,
the
circumstances
of
its
making
and
so
forth,
it
really
doesn't
matter
if
we
don't
confront
and
cross-examine.
i
think
of
the
classic
example
of
the
little
kid
who
is
too
young
to
testify
who
comes
running
out
of
the
perpetrator's
bedroom
holding
a
genital
area
and
saying,
he
hurt
me,
he
hurt
me.
i
don't
see
any
need
for
us
to
cross-examine
that
statement.
nor
would
it
do
us
any
good,
nor
would
it
give
the
jury
any
better
information,
because
all
the
things
relevant
to
whether
or
not
the
statement
is
reliable
evidence
are
found
in
the
circumstances
of
the
making
of
the
statement
against.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
exactly,
mr.
chief
justice.
so
i
think
it's
wrong
for
the
state
to
argue
that
we
can
allow
this
statement
in
because
another
witness...
an
entirely
other
witness...
corroborates
the
statement,
either
the
medical
doctor's
physical
findings
or
the
girl's
sister.
that
would
be
more
like
the
situation
i
brought
up
before,
where
the
trial
judge
rules,
i
believe
the
person
is
guilty
because
i
see
all
this
corroborative
evidence,
therefore
i'll
let
in
hearsay
from
the
victims
of
the
crime,
the
eye
witnesses
and
so
forth.
and
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
suggested
that
we
could
do
that.
the
other
matter
i'd
like
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
to
start
out
with
is,
we
submit
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
idaho
has
misrepresented
to
the
court
the
opinion
of
the
idaho
supreme
court.
and
i
challenge
mr.
jones
in
his
rebuttal
to
the
court
to
show
us
any
place
in
the
text
of
the
opinion...
now,
i'm
not
talking
about
what
one
justice
wrote
in
a
dissent
or
another
justice
wrote
in
a
concurrence
in
another
case,
but
in
the
text
of
the
opinion
that
says,
we
will
not
let
in
any
of
these
statements
if
there
are
any
leading
questions.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
i
agree
with
that.
it
could
have
been
drafted
a
little
more
elegantly.
but
it
never
suggests...
the
court
below
never
suggests
that
these
three
criteria...
absence
of
leading
questions,
absence
of
preconception
by
the
interviewer
and
of
existence
of
a
videotape...
are
hard,
fast,
inflexible
criteria,
the
absence
of
one
of
which
would
mean
that
the
statement
can't
be
admitted
into
evidence
no
matter
how
reliable
it
is,
based
on
other
circumstances.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
no,
i
don't
disagree
that
if
there
had
been
all
those
i
would
have
no
problem
with
them
letting
this
statement
in.
i...
i
have
a
problem,
i
disagree
with
the
state's
position
that
the
idaho
supreme
court
is
holding
that
if
only
one
was
missing--
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
--all
right--
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
--it...
it's
just
reliability,
that...
that
we
could
see--
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
--yes,
we
do.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
but
it's
reliability
that
comes
from
the
circumstances
in
which
the
statement
was
made,
as
opposed
to
corroboration
by
other
witnesses.
we
take
the
instance
of
leading
questions--
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
--that
is
my
opinion,
and
i
believe
that
is
what
the
idaho
supreme
court
said,
contrary
to
what
the
attorney--
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
--it
would
be
an
expansion
of
an
exception
to
the
confrontation
clause,
yes.
the
problem
with
leading
questions
is,
as
research
shows,
you
can
create
a
memory
in
a
child.
if
you
have
the
child
repeat
it,
and
the
child
is
young
enough,
the
child
will
not
be
able
to
tell
whether
that...
won't
be
able
to
distinguish
that
memory
from
an
event
that
really
happened.
in
other
words--
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
--i
agree
with
that
completely,
and
i
believe
the
idaho
supreme
court
does,
too,
that
it
is
okay
to
use
sparing,
judicious
use
of
leading
questions.
our
point
is
that
if
you
use
them,
even
if
you
have
to
use
them
to
a
great
deal,
we
will
be
protected
if
you
videotape
the
entire
procedure
so
we
can
see
it
again,
so
our
experts
can
see
it
again
and
talk
to
the
jury
about
it,
and
so
the
jurors
themselves
can
see
it
and
they
can
say,
okay,
the
experts
say
you
can
lead
a
child
into
saying
something
that
wasn't
true.
let
me
see
exactly
what
happened,
and
i'll
decide
for
myself
if
that
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
no.
i...
i
disagree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
could...
we
could
have
cross-examined
the
doctor
till
we
were
blue
in
our
faces,
but
it
wouldn't
have
shown
the
doctor's
nonverbal
communications,
which
everybody
agrees
is
pertinent,
the
child's
nonverbal
communication,
and
while
it
might
have
shown
the
doctor...
if
he
was
intentionally
manufacturing
evidence,
it
might
have
shown
that,
but
if
he's
innocently
doing
it,
and
he's
doing
it
without
even
being
aware
of,
all
the
cross-examination
in
the
world
won't
help
us
there.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
that's
right.
we
can
make
that
argument,
and
it
is
so
less
effective
that
i
don't
think
it's
fair
or
within
what
the
court
ought
to
allow
in
the
confrontation
clause
because
it
just
seems
rational
that
the
state's
going
to
come
back
and
say
well,
it
could
have
happened,
but
have
you
shown
us
any
evidence
that
it
did?
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
well,
of
course
we
haven't.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
well,
that's
exactly
how
we
do
it
in
idaho
now,
is
a
split
screen,
where
both--
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
--yes.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
yes,
justice
scalia.
both
people
are
on
the
videotape
and
the
entire
thing
is
video-recorded
from
the
very
time
the
interviewer
meets
the
child
until
the
end
of
the
interview.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
in
our
local
community.
partly
as
a
result
of
the
decision
below
we
now
have
a
central
screening
facility
called
children
at
risk
evaluation
screening,
and
if
a
social
worker
even
suspects
sex
abuse,
a
doctor,
a
minister,
a
divorce
lawyer...
anybody
involved
in
this
whole
system...
the
child
is
taken
to
the
cares
program
for
the
screening,
which
is
done
on
videotape.
it's
a
practical
thing,
a
practical
result
that
has
happened
as
a
result
of
the
decision
below,
and
it's
something
that
could
happen
nationwide
if
the
court
affirms.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
absolutely,
i
do.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
excuse
me,
justice
o'connor.
i
may
have
misstated
myself.
am
i...
if
you're
asking
me
do
i
require
or
do
i
say
the
constitution
requires
videotaping
in
every
circumstance,
my
answer
is
no.
it
is
one
of
the
factors
that
the
court
should
look
at
in
deciding
admissibility
under
the
constitution.
but
if
it
is
necessary
to
use
leading
questions,
if
instead
of
an
inadvertent--
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
--yes,
they
would.
of
course,
if
this
child,
as
was
talked
about
earlier,
if
the
child
comes
up
with
a
statement
about
sexual
abuse
on
his
own
or
on
her
own,
that
lends
a
lot
of
credibility
to
it.
if
the
examiner
is
specifically
trying
to
investigate
it
and
the
investigator
has
some
beliefs
ahead
of
time,
the
investigator
is
more
likely
to
ask
leading
questions.
again,
neither
the
state...
neither
the
state
supreme
court
nor
i
have
any
problem
with
that
or
the
preconception,
nor
do
we
always
say
there
should
be
a
videotape.
our
problem
is
the
interrelationship
of
those
factors.
the
stronger
the
interrogator
holds
a
preconception,
the
more
likely
the
interrogator
is
to
suggest
a
memory
to
the
child
of
something
it
didn't
even
have,
whether
consciously
and
viciously
or
completely
accidentally.
if
the
interrogator
believes
this
is
what
happens
and
asks
leading
questions,
it's
more
likely
that
that's
what
he's
going
to
get
out.
if
the
interrogator
finds
that
he
needs
to
use
extremely
blatantly
leading
questions,
well,
that
may...
in
a
proper
case
that
may
be
necessary.
and
there
again,
we
don't
have
a
problem
with
that,
but
videotape
it
so
we
can
protect
ourselves.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
yes,
justice
o'connor.
if
i
may
clarify
a
little
bit,
the
totality
of
circumstances
surrounding
the
statement,
not
what
other
witnesses
may
corroborate
or
other
witnesses
may
say--
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
--and
that's
how
i
see
the
holding
below.
excuse
me.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
in
our
jurisdiction,
the
trial
courts
are
pretty
nice
and
kind
about
giving
us
access
to
victims
for
things
such
as
that.
the
problem
with
it
is
if
instead
of
having
this
interview
videotaped
and
it's
the
first
interview
of
the
child,
if
the
parents
have
been
feeding
the
kid...
or
somebody
else...
has
been
implanting
this
in
the
child's
mind
for
a
significant
period
of
time
before
the
video
camera
comes
on,
then
there
is
no
way
to
get
at
the
truth
at
that
point.
that's
why
i
think
it's
important
that
it's
the
initial
interviews
that
be
videotaped
or
as
close
to
the
initial
interviews
as
possible.
it
does
us
no
good
after
we've
been
talking
to
the
child
for
a
year,
all
of
a
sudden
to
turn
the
video
camera.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
if
we
have
the
record
of
the
first
time
it
came
out
or
at
least
the
first
time
that
somebody
tried
to
interrogate
the
child
about
it,
then
we
can
get
to
the
basis
of
it.
if
somebody's
been
interrogating
the
child
and
leading
the
child
for
a
year
before
the
videotape
goes
on,
then
there...
it
doesn't
help.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
justice
scalia,
you're
pointing
up
another
possibility
not
presented
by
this
case,
and
i
don't
know
if
this
is
where
you
were
going,
but
i...
i
believe
the
court
should
leave
this
possibility
open.
and
there
is
a
whole'nother
side
to
the
potential
of
solving
this
dilemma,
and
that
is
to
say
that
state
competency
rules
will
just
fall
in
the
face
of
the
confrontation
challenge,
that
if
you
want
to
let
these
hearsay
statements
in,
then
you
put
the
child
on
the
stand
so
the
jury
can
see
exactly
what
the
trial
judge
saw
that
led
the
judge
to
believe
the
child
could
not
testify
reliably.
now,
i'm
excluding
the
situation
where
the
child
is
traumatized,
but
wouldn't
it
have
been
helpful
for
this
jury
to
hear
the...
the
colloquy
on
the
voir
dire
to
determine
competency?
"hi,
kathy.
"
"can
you
tell
me
your
name?
"
no
response.
"are
you
kind
of
scared?
"
"can
you
tell
me
your
name
and
tell
me
how
old
you
are?
"
"kathy
wright".
"can
you
tell
me
the
names
of
the
toys
you
have
that
you
are
holding?
"
"that's
your
name,
okay.
"
"how
old
are
you,
kathy?
"
"how
old
are
you?
"
"my...
kathy
wright".
"can
you
tell
me
the
names
of
your
father
and
your
mother?
"
"can
you
tell
me
what
they
are?
"
"what"?
"do
you
know
where
you
are
right
now?
"
"no".
"can
you
tell
me
how
old
you
are,
kathy?
"
"do
you
know
how
many
years
you've
been
alive?
"
"six.
"
"six
years.
"
"how
old
do
you
think
you
are?
"
"six
years".
and,
of
course,
she
was
three
years
old.
wouldn't
it
have
been
helpful
for
the
jury
to
see
that
before
they
decide
whether
or
not
they're
going
to
believe
this
child?
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
that
is
the
record
in
the
case
before
the
court.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
the
finding
is,
and
amply
supported
by
the
record,
that
child
cannot
respond
to
simple
questions
with
simple
answers.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
i
certainly
do.
that's
competence
like
witness
competence
has
always
been
talked
about.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
the
word
"competence"
wasn't
used.
that
is
our
rule.
the
rule
that
the
judge
applied,
the
trial
judge,
is
our
rule
of
witness
competence.
we
don't
have
one
of
those
rules
that
say
if
you're
under
ten
or
if
you're
under
five.
it's
can
you
communicate
and
are
you
capable
of
receiving
just
impressions,
and
based
on
that
record
the
trial
judge
correctly
concluded
this
child
was
not
and
is
incompetent
under
idaho
law.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
it
was,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
it's...
it's
hard
to
tell
that.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
well,
if
a
child
is
incompetent
at
one
time,
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
she's
incompetent
at
another
time.
and
what
is
important
is
what
this
judge
looked
at
in
order
to
rule
that
that
statement
is
admissible,
and
that
is
the
testimony
of
the
girl's
sister,
the
testimony
of
the
doctor
and
his
physical
findings...
in
other
words,
all
this
corroboration
from
other
unrelated
evidence
which
we
should
not
look
at
in
a
confrontation
clause
analysis.
for
hearsay
rule
purposes,
it's
fine.
and
the
idaho
supreme
court
said
under
our
hearsay
rule
that's
fine
and
it
will
be
admitted.
when
we're
talking
confrontation,
whether
the
defendant
will
have
the
right
to
have
that
person
in
front
of
the
jury
where
they
can
see
demeanor
evidence
and
the
defendant
can
cross-examine
that
witness,
then
we're
just
talking
about
the
circumstances
of
the
statement,
and
that's
another
matter.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
well,
i...
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
that
would
be
allowable
under
idaho
law.
second
of
all,
i
think
it's
stretching
the
effectiveness
of
instructions
to
the
jury
a
little
bit
to
admit
it
and
say,
but
you
have
to
ignore
it,
as
far
as
determining
what
the
truth
is.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
it...
it
is.
but
if
we're
talking
about
something
so
direct
and
central
to
the
crime,
my
understanding
is
this
court
has
put
some
restrictions
on
a
court's
ability
to
do
that.
specifically,
the
case
where--
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
--yes,
i
would.
i...
again,
it
may
be
that
that
would
be
admissible
under
the
hearsay
rule.
that
doesn't
mean
it
would
be
admissible
under
the
confrontation
clause.
i
submit
that
it
would
not.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
right.
and
i
think
it
ought
to
be
the
one
who
says
you're
guilty.
namely,
the
child.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
well,
that's
true.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
that's
true.
but
it's
the
child
who
made
the
hearsay
statement.
so
we
should...
yes.
and
for
that
reason
we
should
have
a
right
to
confront
them
both.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
no,
sir,
i
did
not.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
20
years
on
each
count.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
yes,
sir.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
she
is
filing
a
petition
for
post-conviction
relief
on
the
other
count.
and
she
is
still
hopeful
of
getting
completely
out
of
prison.
the
other
count
wasn't
raised
on
direct
appeal
because
there
were
issues
that
were
not
properly
in
the
record,
one
of
the
worst
being
that
one
public
defender
represented
both
the
defendants,
and
that
never
should
have
happened.
and
she
still
intends
to
file
that
petition.
one
reason
we're
holding
off
is
we're
waiting
to
see
the
outcome
of
this
proceeding.
our
suggestions
of
videotaping
have
been
objected
to
by
the
other
side.
the
child
advocate
amici
have
said,
well,
it's
not
practical.
they've
said...
and
i'm
paraphrasing
now...
that,
well,
these
disclosures
come
out
in
a
variety
of
circumstances,
few
of
them
lend
themselves
to
videotaping.
and
i'll
agree
with
that.
i
just
wonder
what
the
heck
it
has
to
do
with
the
situation
before
the
court,
where
young
kathy
wright
was
ripped
out
of
her
parent's
home
because
the
cops
and
the
social
workers
had
specific
information
from
kathy's
sister
that
she'd
been
sexually
abused.
they
took
her
into
protective
custody.
they
had
sole
control
over
her.
they
chose
the
doctor
and
took
her
to
that
doctor
solely
for
the
purpose
of
investigating
sexual
abuse.
while
i
think
the
child
advocates
are
right
to
say,
we
just
can't
expect
videotaping
of
spontaneous
statements,
we
have
no
problem
with
that.
what
we're
concerned
about
is
where
leading
questions
are
used
and
the
interrogator
had
preconceptions.
and
there
is
absolutely
no
good
reason
on
earth
that
we
can
see
why
the
interrogation
could
not
have
been
videotaped.
we
would
submit
that
use
of
videotape
fulfills
some
of
the
very
values
that
the
confrontation
clause
was
designed
to
secure,
and
does
it
in
similar
ways
to
cross-examination.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
yes,
sir.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
yes,
yes.
if
there
is
a
videotape
the
jury
can
see
demeanor.
of
course,
the
court
has
said
again
and
again,
u.s.
v.
mattox,
just
one
of
many
examples,
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
confrontation
is
preservation
of
demeanor
evidence.
if
a
videotape
is
presented,
it
preserves
evidence
of
any
tainting,
any
suggestion
by
the
interviewer.
and
in
that
respect,
it
serves,
like
cross-examination,
as
a
means
for
an
innocent
accused
to
protect
himself
or
herself.
if
a
memory
like
this
has
been
suggested
to
a
child
and
repeated,
cross-examination
at
trial
is
apt
to
offer
an
innocent
accused
impotent
protection,
because
the
memory
has
already
been
confabulated
and
entrenched
in
the
child
as
a
memory
of
a
real
event.
on
the
other
hand,
the
videotaping
of
the
actual
interview
where
the
suggestion
occurred
will
offer
us
a
lot
of
protection,
akin
to
that
that
cross-examination
ordinarily
offers
for
other
witnesses.
we
aren't
suggesting
that
all
these
things
have
to
be
videotaped.
we're
only
suggesting
that
a
videotape
provides
the
state
or
the
government
an
excellent
means
of
proving
those
indicia
of
reliability
required
by
this
court's
opinions.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
no,
because
it's
impractical.
because
these
interrogations
usually
occur
before
there's
any
charge,
and
of
course
before
the
defendant
has
notice
of
what's
going
on.
it's
an
investigation.
the
defendant
doesn't
have
a
right
to
counsel
at
that
point,
or
at
least--
mr.
rolf
michael
kehne
--if
that's
what
we're
relying
on.
in
the
case
of
kathy
it
wasn't.
she
just
can't
answer
questions.
if
the
state
is
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
child
is
too
afraid
to
talk
in
front
of
the
defendant,
yes,
i
would
insist
on,
well,
let's
actually
see
it.
prove
it.
demonstrate
it.
if...
i
hope
that
answers
your
question.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i'm
about
out
of
time,
and
i
have
nothing
else.
thank
you.
