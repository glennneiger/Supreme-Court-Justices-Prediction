justice
jr.
general
jones,
may
i
ask,
initially
there
were
two
counts,
were
there
not?
justice
jr.
and
the
conviction
under
the
first
count
was
reversed,
was
it?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
well,
at
some
stage,
and
i'm
not
quite
clear
from
the
record
when,
the
second
count
was
dismissed,
was
it
not?
justice
jr.
and
that's
before
us,
is
it?
justice
jr.
well
was
that...
was
on
that
motion
to
reinstate
the
count
two?
justice
jr.
well,
didn't
the
trial
court
dismiss
that
count,
though,
before
we
granted
certiorari?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
well,
he
had
authority
to
do
what
he
did,
did
he
not?
he
had
authority
to--
justice
jr.
--well,
what...
what
was
left
of
the
case
when
the
count
was
dismissed?
justice
jr.
i
mean
this
all
happened
while
cert.
was
pending,
but
before
we
had
acted
on
the
petition
for
certiorari,
did
it
not?
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
what
was
the
case
that
was
here
while
the
count
was
dismissed,
before
it
was
reinstated?
