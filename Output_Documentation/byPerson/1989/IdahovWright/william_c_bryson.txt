mr.
william
c.
bryson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
view,
the
idaho
supreme
court
made
a
legal
error
in
this
case
that's
best
summed
up
by
pointing
to
three
critical
factors
that
the
court
did
not
consider
or
even
mention
in
its
opinion:
first,
the
corroboration
in
this
case.
this
court
and
others
have
pointed
out
again
and
again
in
the
confrontation
clause
context
and
others
that
the
degree
of
corroboration
for
a
particular
statement
is
a
very
important
indicium
of
reliability
of
the
statement.
the
second,
the
spontaneity
of
the
statement.
while
the
idaho
supreme
court
is
very
critical
of
the
doctor
for
asking
leading
questions,
the
court
overlooks
the
fact
that
the
one...
the
one
response
that
the
child
made
which
is
the
critical
response
in
this
case,
"he
does
it
with
me
but
he
does
it
more
with
my
sister
than
with
me.
"
wasn't
in
response...
wasn't
responsive
to
a
leading
question.
it
was
blurted
out
in
the
course
of
the
doctor's
questioning.
it
was--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
normally,
that's
right,
and...
and
we're
not
urging
that
it
should
be
construed
in
that
way.
but
i
think
what's
important
in
term...
determining
whether
it
bears
the
indicia
of
reliability
is
that
it
was
spontaneous
and
volunteered.
it
was
not
a
nod
or
a
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir,
yes,
sir
type
response
to
a
doctor's
leading
questions.
third
is
the
fact
that
this
child,
the
younger
child
was
in
the
custody
of
the
defendants
until
just
before
the
physical
examination,
and
so
the
theory
of
the
case,
the
theory
of
defense
in
this
case,
which
is
that
the
second
set
of
parents
must
have...
or
somebody
else
must
have
programmed
this
child
to
make
these
statements,
just
won't
wash
with
respect
to
this
child,
this
younger
child,
because
she
wouldn't
have
had
any
opportunity
to
be
programmed.
she
was
with
the
defendants
throughout
the
period
up
until
the
time
that
she
went
to
the
doctor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
there
is...
there
is
a
certain
degree
of...
of
parallelism.
i
think
in
dutton
v.
evans,
justice
stewart's
opinion
points
out
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
evidence
was
admissible
was
that
it
really
did
not--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
didn't
prove
much,
i
guess
is
the
point,
and
i
think
justice
blackmun
wrote
a
separate
opinion
in
that
case
pointing
out
and
relying
on
the
harmless
error
factor.
it
is
true
that
where
you
have
overwhelming
evidence,
corroborative
evidence
that
supports
the
reliability
of
a
statement,
you
may
also
have
something
that
approaches
harmless
error.
of
course,
harmless
error
isn't
an
issue
in
this
case
as
it
comes
to
this
court.
but,
nonetheless,
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
each
of
the
various
features
of
corroboration
to
show
how
reliable
this
statement
was
even
though,
of
course,
it
wasn't
subject
to
cross-examination.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
they...
the
out-of-court
statement
fell...
the
state
did
hold
in
the
other
case,
the
giles
case,
that
it
fell
within
the
state's
residual
hearsay
exception.
i
think
it
would
also...
they
would
also
fall
within
the
federal
exception.
i
don't...
in
other
words,
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,
the
way--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,
my
answer
to
that
question
is
that
the
residual
exceptions
are
written
in
order
to
try
to
incorporate
this
court's
confrontation
clause
jurisprudence.
in
other
words,
they
require,
among
other
things,
specific
indicia
of
reliability.
so
i
think
if
a
court,
a
federal
court,
let's
say,
applying
the
federal
residual
exceptions
correctly,
finds
that
something
falls
within
the
residual
exception,
it
would
almost
necessarily
have
also
made
the
findings
necessary
to
satisfy
the
confrontation
clause.
but
now,
of
course,
a
state
would
be
free
to
construe
its
residual
exception
more
broadly
than
that,
and
if
it
did
then
you
would
have
to
view
the
confrontation
clause
inquiry
separately.
so
i
would
say
normally
my
answer
to
your
question
is
yes
but
not
necessarily,
particularly
depending
on
the
way
the
particular
clause
was...
was
construed
in
the
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
i
think
where
the
finding
is...
and
by
the
way,
the
finding
in
this
case
was...
was
not
objected
to
by...
indeed,
both
sides
concurred
that
the
witness
was
incapable
of
testifying
in
court.
where
the
finding
is
simply
that
the
witness
cannot
communicate
in
court
and
it
doesn't
suggest
what
normally
we
think
of
by
incompetence,
which
is
that
the
witness
is
incapable
of
observing
or
reporting
in
any
context,
then
the
problem
is
just
one
of
unavailability.
it
doesn't...
in
other
words,
the
finding
of
incompetence
in
this
case,
if
that's
what
it
was,
was
not
a
finding
that
went
to
the
child's
ability
to...
to
observe
and
communicate.
it
went
to
the
child's
ability
to
testify
in
court,
and
on
that
there
was
no
dispute
among
the
parties.
now,
if
i
may
point
to
the...
the
corroboration
that's
present
in
this
case.
number
one,
there's
clear
physical...
evidence
of
physical
abuse
to
the
younger
daughter.
the
pediatrician
found
strong
basis
for
a
belief
that
there
had
been
physical
abuse.
two,
testimony
in
court
from
the
older
daughter,
which
is
essentially,
you
could
use
the
expression,
an
interlocking
statement
with
that
of
the
younger
daughter
because
both
of
them
said
that
the
parents
had
abused
each
of
them.
that
was
the
testimony
of
the
older
daughter.
it
was
the
statement
of
the
younger
daughter.
they
were
interlocking
in
that
sense.
the
third
piece
of
corroborative
evidence,
there
was
physical
abuse
of
the
older
child.
again,
the
medical
evidence
on
this
is
clear,
and
the...
by
the
way,
that
was
corroborated
not
by...
just
by
dr.
jambura
but
by
two
other
doctors.
and
fourth,
out-of-court
statements,
which
were
admitted
without
objection,
of
the
older
daughter
detailing
in...
extensively
to
a
number
of
different
people,
including
the
therapist,
the
various
incidents
of...
of
abuse
with
respect
to
both
daughters.
so
this
is
a
very
well
corroborated
out-of-court
statement.
you
seldom
see
this
degree
of
corroboration.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
if
the...
if
the
trial
court
finds
that
the
witness
is
truly
incapable
of
observing...
let's
take
it
out
of
the
child
area
and
say
this
is
the
person
of
such
low
mental
capacity
that
the
person
is...
the
trial
judge's
judgment
is
that
person
is
incapable
of
making
observations
and
reporting
them
to
anyone
in
any
context.
then
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
serious
problem
for
admissibility
in
that
setting
because
the
judge
would
have
found
that
there
is
no
basis
for
believing
that
the
statement
is
reliable
because
the
judge
would
have
found
that
this
can't
have
happened.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
the
judge
at
joint
appendix
39
makes
a
finding
that
the
child
is
incapable
of
communicating
with
the
jury,
and
that
was
the
whole
thrust
of
the...
of
the
colloquy
that
preceded
it,
and
it
was
the
basis
on
which
the
idaho
supreme
court
took
this
case.
now,
i
want
to
emphasize
again,
there
are--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
it's
ja
39,
i
believe,
is
the
place
where
the
actual
finding
is
made,
the
unobjected-to
finding,
on
the
top
of
the
right-hand
side,
i
think.
the...
there
was,
according
to
the
idaho
supreme
court,
a
flaw
in
the
interrogation,
and
i'd
like
to
address
that
briefly.
the
principal
claim
is
the
doctor
must
have
been
biased,
and
here
i
think
the
idaho
supreme
court
really
went
wrong.
doctors
do
get
as
much
information
about
a
case
in
advance
to
aid
their
diagnosis
as
they
can;
and
yet,
the
idaho
supreme
court
seemed
to
take
the
view
that
if
this
doctor
had
advance
information
that
suggested
there
may
have
been
child
abuse
in
this
case,
that
his
report
of
the
statement
was
somehow
impeached,
somehow
unreliable.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
those
are
two
different
things.
i
don't
think
there's
any
indication
in
this
record
that
this
doctor
had
an
objective
in
mind.
this
doctor...
there's
no
suggestion
that
this
doctor
was
trying
to
find
child
abuse.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
he
certainly
was,
just
as
a
doctor
would
look
for
evidence
of
whatever
particular
malady
the
person...
the
patient
came
to
him
complaining
of.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
it's
more
like
that
you
are
suspicious
of
the
doctor--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that...
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that
would
be
very
reliable,
but
you're
going
to
have
a
lot
of
cases
in
which
a
child
will
be
taken
to
a
doctor
for
a
question
of
whether
this...
there's
evidence
of
child
abuse
where
the
doctor
knows
that
there
is
a
suggestion
of
child
abuse.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
and
the
medical
exception,
and
i
would...
i
would--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
it...
to
the
extent
that
if
it's
blurted
out
in
the
context
where
no
questions
on
that
subject
had
been
asked
at
all,
i
would
think
it
would
be
extremely
reliable.
so
yes
to
that
extent.
but
the
idaho
supreme
court
said
something
very
different.
they
said
you
have
to
be
dubious
of
this
evidence
because
of
the
doctor's
advance
knowledge,
and
i
would
point
out--
thank
you
very
much.
