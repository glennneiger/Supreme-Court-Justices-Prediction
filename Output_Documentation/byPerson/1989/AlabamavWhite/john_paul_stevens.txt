justice
stevens
you
say...
you
say
this
related
to
a
specific
purpose...
person?
justice
stevens
how
did
the
officer
at
the
time
know
this
was
a
specific
person?
justice
stevens
well,
then,
how
can
you
possibly
rely
on
the
identification
as
a
justification
for
stopping
the
car?
justice
stevens
but
they
didn't
know
she
came
out
of
235-c
and
they
did
know
she
was...
whatever
her
name
was.
justice
stevens
they
saw
a
woman
come
out
of
that
particular
building.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
she
was--
justice
stevens
--she
was
supposed
to
be
carrying
a
brown
brief
case
and
she
wasn't.
justice
stevens
well,
she
wasn't
carrying
it
when
she
got
in
the
car.
she
just--
justice
stevens
--it
was
just
in
the
car
before
she
got
in
it.
justice
stevens
the
one...
does
the
record
tell
us
why
they
used
a
second
patrol
car
and
stopped
the
woman
before
she
got
to
the
motel?
justice
stevens
i
see.
they
had
to
have
one
with
a
light
on.
justice
stevens
that
would
explain
why
they
would
use
the
second
car.
justice
stevens
but
it
wouldn't
really
explain
why
they
wouldn't
wait
until
she
got
to
the
motel.
justice
stevens
it
doesn't.
justice
stevens
but
they
stopped
her
in
front
of
the...
and
actually
they
called
the
other
car
and
told
them
to
stop
her
while
she
was
on
the
mobile
road,
didn't
they?
justice
stevens
mobile.
justice
stevens
but
isn't
that
kind
of
a
main
highway?
justice
stevens
is
that
a
limited
access
highway?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
what
if
she'd
said
no?
do
you
think
they
could
have
said
we'll
search
it
anyway?
justice
stevens
that's
the--
justice
stevens
--i
guess
that's
the
question.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
the
fact
that
she
might
have
said
have
no
could
be
taken
as
evidence
supporting
the
search
if
they--
