justice
scalia
and
gates
involved
activities
which
on
their
face
looked
sneaky
and
underhanded.
i
mean,
as
soon
as
you
saw
the
activities
that...
that
had
been
noticed
to
the
police,
you
said,
gee,
this
is
a
very
strange
kind
of
activity
going
on.
it
looks
like
there's
something
afoot.
whereas
one
wouldn't
think
there
was
anything
afoot
in
this
case.
it's
just
like
saying,
you
know,
if
you
go
out
there
you
will
see
somebody
walking
down
the
street.
and
the
cop
goes
out
and
says,
ah-hah,
there
is
somebody
walking
down
the
street.
there
is
something
afoot
here.
that
was
not
gates.
gates
was
a
very
complicated
system
of
people
driving
cars
back
and
coming
back
by
plane.
and
you
says,
gee,
why
are
they
doing
that?
it
must
be
some,
you
know,
something
under
it.
isn't
that
a
big
difference
between
gates
and
this
case?
there
was
no
indication
here,
no
reason
to
suspect
anything.
justice
scalia
so,
it
really
doesn't
matter,
you're
saying,
whether
the
tipster
gives
any
indication
of
knowing
the
person
well.
i
mean,
you
know,
when
a
tipster
calls
up
and
says
there's
a
bomb
in
the
building,
you
don't
say,
now
wait
a
minute,
do
you
know
the
owner
of
the
building?
you
don't
care
at
all,
do
you?
justice
scalia
well,
now,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
justice
scalia
right.
but
that's
not
the
position
you're
taking.
that...
that's
a
sensible
position,
a
consistent
position.
but
you're...
you're
trying
to
ride
the
two
horses
it
seems
to
me.
justice
scalia
does
the
nature
of
the
crime
make
a
difference
or
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
just
giving
it
a
fancy
name.
justice
scalia
mr.
marston,
how
many...
how
likely
is
it
that
somebody
that
left
where
she
left
in
the
car
would
have
gone
by
the
doby
motel?
i
mean,
is
it--
justice
scalia
--is
it
a
circuitous
route
to
get
there
or
is
the
doby
motel,
you
know...
if
you
went
one
of
two
ways
on
the
main
street
when
you
left
where
she
was,
you
were
bound
to
go
by
the
doby
motel?
justice
scalia
circuitous.
justice
scalia
i
missed
it
the
first
time,
too.
justice
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
scalia
let
me
ask
you
another
thing.
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
stop?
what...
is...
is
it
your
position
that
had
they
stopped
her
and
seen
the
suitcase
or
the
briefcase
that
they
could
have...
could
have
made
an
arrest?
justice
scalia
but
you
don't
think
that's
necessary
to
your
case?
justice
scalia
well,
why
does
the
tip
give
justification
to
do
that?
because
the
theory
is
that
if
the
person
has
cocaine
in
the
briefcase,
the
person,
of
course,
will
let
you
search
the
briefcase
and...
why
does
it
justify
a
stop?
justice
scalia
that
for
an
articulable
suspicion?
you
might
need
it
for
probable
cause,
but
if
somebody
just
calls...
calls
me
up
anonymously...
i
have
no
idea
who
it
is,
but
says,
you
know,
so
and
so
is
stealing
from
your
garden
every
night...
do
you
think
i
might
not
go
out
and
look
that
night
to
see
if
somebody's
stealing
my
tomatoes?
justice
scalia
why?
justice
scalia
well,
i
think...
i
think
what
he's
saying
there...
that
exchange
that
you
quoted...
i
think
all
he
meant
to
say
is
that
the
caller
didn't
say
that
230...
whatever
the
number
is...
30...
235-c...
was
her
residence.
the
question
is
the
caller...
so,
in
effect
the
information
was
that
she
would
be
leaving
her
residence
at
a
given
time.
the
caller
didn't
say
she
would
be
leaving
her
residence.
he
just
said
she
would
be
leaving
this
area.
i...
i
think
what
was
left
out
is
whether
that
was
her
residence
or
not.
i...
i
think
you'll
find,
mr.
byrne,
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
it,
that
we
will
probably
take
the
view
of
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals.
justice
scalia
well,
do
you
think
the
anonymous
tip
would
have
been
significantly
left...
less
precise
if
it
had
said
a
woman
will
leave
the
235
building
and
get
into
a
brown
station
wagon
than
if
it
had
said
a
woman
will
leave
235-c
in
the
235
building
and
get
into
a
plymouth
station
wagon?
justice
scalia
both
of
them
seems
to
me
to
be,
you
know,
narrowing
it
down
to
a--
justice
scalia
i
said
that.
i
just
said
that
a
little
earlier
today.
justice
scalia
what
if
you
had
these...
these
facts
and
the
caller
added,
"and
she
will
be
carrying
a
bomb
which
she
is
going
to
plant
at
the
hotel?
"
justice
scalia
what
does
that
mean?
that
there...
that
there
was
a
reasonable...
reasonable...
reasonably
articulable
suspicion
in
that
case?
justice
scalia
or
you
don't
care
in
that
case?
justice
scalia
you
don't
care.
you'd
say
there
still
is
no
reasonably
articulable
suspicion
but
the
officer
ought
to
do
it
anyway.
justice
scalia
of
course,
it's
even
rarer
for
them
to
disclose
an
anonymous
informant,
and
if
my
life
were
at
stake,
i
suppose
i'd
play
the
odds
and
want
to
remain
anonymous.
