justice
kennedy
i...
i...
does
it
say
that
she
would
have
it
in
the
car?
was
that
what
the
tipster
said?
justice
kennedy
well,
the
record
shows
they
didn't
even
ask
for
her
name
until
after
she
was
out
of
the
car
and
a
search
commenced.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
then--
justice
kennedy
--but
then...
the...
the
name
just
doesn't
help
you
at
all
in
this
case.
justice
kennedy
unless
it's
a
serious
crime?
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
rule
you're
recommending.
you
say,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense,
but...
that's
the
rule
you're
recommending?
justice
kennedy
so,
suppose
there's
an
anonymous
tip
that
just
says
the
people
standing
on
the
corner
of
4th
and
m
are
engaged
in
a
drug
transaction?
justice
kennedy
the
people
standing
on
the
corner
of
4th
and
m
are
engaged
in
a
drug
transaction.
justice
kennedy
right
now.
justice
kennedy
and
that's
all.
justice
kennedy
so,
you
would
say
that
if
the
police
officers
then
proceeded
and
saw
some
people
standing
there
talking
he
could
not
engage
in
the
stop
based
on
the
tip?
he
saw
how
many
people?
i
mean,
see,
you'd
get
into
a
lot
of
different
problems.
how
many
people
on
this
street?
what
time
is
it?
if
it--
justice
kennedy
what
how...
what
about
page
5--
justice
kennedy
--of
the
joint
appendix?
maybe
you
could
help
me
with
that.
the
question
specifically,
"from
what
location
would
she
be
leaving?
"
answer:
"she
would
be
leaving
235-c
lynwood
terrace.
"
that's
the
direct
examination
of
corporal
davis.
justice
kennedy
now,
is
there...
is
there
something
that
appears
in
the
transcript
that
indicates
he
later
recants
that?
justice
kennedy
mr.
byrne,
a
much
more
common
situation
is
an
anonymous
tip
that
a
drug
transaction
is
taking
place.
and
in
the
present
drug
culture
we
have,
many
of
these
tips
are
and
must
be
anonymous
because
the
people
that
give
the
tip
know
that
there
own
lives
are
in
danger.
are...
are
drug
transactions
one,
do
you
think,
in
which
we
should
find
that
there
is
a
reasonable
ground
for
suspicion
merely
because
there's
a
tip
that
has
not
much
more
verification
than
the
one
we
have
in
the
present
case?
justice
kennedy
but
with
reference
to
somebody
having
a
bomb
or
committing
a
murder,
there's...
there's
usually
not
much
reason
for
anonymity.
within
drug
transactions
there
is
all
the
time.
justice
kennedy
but...
but
under
your
view,
of
course,
they
couldn't
have
made
that
stop.
or
could
they?
could
they
have
made...
are
you
suggesting
they
could
have
made
the
stop
and
asked
her
for
her
license?
justice
kennedy
because...
because
of
the
broken
tail
light?
