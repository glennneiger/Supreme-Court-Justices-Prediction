mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
stopping
of
a
vehicle
on
a
public
highway
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon.
having
stopped
the
respondent's
automobile,
the
officers
requested
and
received
permission
to
search
it.
and
that
was
given.
the
consensual
search
produced
controlled
substances
upon...
on
the
basis
of
which
the
respondent
was
taken
into
custody.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
of
alabama
ruled
that
this
was
an
investigatory
stop
and
that
it
was
illegal,
contrary
to
the
fourth
amendment,
because
it
was
allegedly
not
based
on
reasonable
suspicion.
now,
this
case
is
basically
a
scaled-down
version
of
illinois
v.
gates.
the
cases
are
virtually
identical
except
for
the
scope
of
the
matter,
gates
involved
a
cross-country
trip,
there
and
back.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes,
sir.
that
was
my
next
point.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
reasonable
suspicion.
yes,
sir.
gates
involved
a
cross-country
trip.
this
involved
a
cross-town
trip.
gates
involved
the
search
of
a
home,
probable
cause.
this
involved
the
stopping
of
an
automobile
under
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
justice
scalia,
i...
first
of
all,
i
would
disagree
with
you.
i
think
the
facts
in
gates
were
that...
that
mr.
gates...
of
course,
first
of
all
you
have
the
anonymous
tip
that
predicted
this.
mr.
gates
flew
down
to
florida.
he
met
an
unidentified
woman,
who
turned
out
to
be
mrs.
gates,
and
they
drove
back
to
illinois.
and
that's
what
the
officer
saw.
and
that,
you
know...
yes,
it's
unusual,
but
there
is
nothing
criminal
about
it.
it
could
have
been
the
wife
was
sick.
i
mean,
you
know,
it's
not...
there
was
nothing
there
that
if
you
take
away
the
anonymous
tip
that
isn't...
is
even...
is
indicative
of
criminal
activity
at
all.
and
that's
true
here.
if
you
take
away
the
anonymous
tip,
you
have
perfectly
normal
activity.
i
mean,
that
can't
be
disputed.
but
i
think
the
facts
in
gates
come
up
the
same
thing.
take
away
the
anonymous
tip
and
you
have,
perhaps
unusual
activity,
but
not
anything
criminal,
not
anything
suspicious.
if...
if
in
gates
you
took
away
the
anonymous
letter
and
you...
you
cite
those
facts,
i
don't
think
any
police
officer
would
be
justified
in
taking
any
action
on
what
they
saw.
we
would
point
out,
of
course,
both
cases
involve
anonymous
tips.
both
related
to
specific
persons;
both
predicted
the
presence
of
drugs
in
an
automobile.
now,
and
gates--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--person.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
well,
they
did
not
get
the
identification
of
ms.
white
before
they
stopped
the
car.
however--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--no,
sir,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
they...
the
fact
that
they
knew,
because
they
didn't.
but
the
anonymous
tipster
had
said
vanessa
rose
white
will
come
out
of
apartment
235-c,
lynwood
terrace
apartments,
get
in
a
brown
station
wagon.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
they
saw
her
come
out
of
building
235.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
and
get
into
a
brown
station
wagon
with
a
broken
right
tail
light.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
and
then
proceed
to
the
doby
motel.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
they
stopped
her
just
short
of
the
doby
motel.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
she
was
supposed
to
be...
no...
yes,
sir,
she
was,
but
they
didn't
see
it
until
they
got
the
car
stopped.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
no.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes,
but
the
tipster
didn't
say
she'd
be
carrying
it.
she
said...
he
said,
she
would
have
it
in
the
car.
now,
she
could
have
been
carrying
it,
but
she...
they,
in
fact,
did
not
see
her
carrying
anything
getting
in
the
car.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
the
tipster
said
she
would
be...
she
would
go
to
the
doby
motel
and
be
carrying
a
brown
brief
case.
i
do
not
believe
that...
i
don't
understand
that
to
mean
she
would
carrying
it
out
of
the
house
but
rather
that
it
would
be
in
the
car.
because
that...
that's
what
he
said.
and
it
was,
of
course,
in
fact
in
the
car
but
they
couldn't
see
that,
and
it
was
seen
after
the
car
was
stopped.
but
they
couldn't
see
that
until
the
car
was
stopped.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes,
sir.
they
did
not
ask
her
name.
of
course,
again,
that
would
be
after
the
car
was
stopped.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
and
it's
the
stopping
of
the
car--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--no,
sir.
i
don't...
i
don't
contend
that
at
all.
what
identified
this
person
as
the
person
the
tipster
referred
to
was
the
fact
she
came
out
of
that
apartment
building,
got
in
this
car
and
drove
to
doby's
motel.
it
was
all
those...
those
factors.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
he
said
now.
i
mean,
it
was...
it
was
immediate,
and
they
went
right
out
there
and
here
she
came.
so,
we
had
time,
place,
vehicle
and
destination.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
no,
ma'am,
but
she's...
it
was
just
short
of
the
motel.
there
are
two
driveways
between...
well,
she
was
stopped
at
one
driveway.
there's
another
driveway.
the
next
one
is
the
motel.
so,
it
was
right
at
doby's
motel.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
not
at...
no,
no,
ma'am.
they
stopped--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--that
she
got
to
the
motel?
no.
but
we
do
have
the
factor
that
she
was
headed
to
the
motel,
in
the
right
direction.
and
when
they
stopped
her,
she
was
in
position
to
be
going
toward
the
motel.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
i
would
suggest
that...
that...
that
there
should
be
any...
any
strict
test,
but
rather
should
be
if
the
tip
is
verified.
if
the
factors
are
verified
to
indicate...
enough
to
indicate--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--well,
see,
that
is
going
to
depend
on
the
situation.
it's
going
to
be
very
difficult
to
formulate
a
precise
rule
that'll
work
in
every
case.
but
i
would
suggest
that
what...
what
the
court
should
look
for
is
whether
or
not
enough
was
identified,
enough
was
verified
to
say
this
tipster
knew
this
woman
and...
or
this
person...
and
knew
enough
in
this
case
to
say
what
her
itinerary
was
that
afternoon.
now,
the
reason
for
that
is...
there
are
many
reasons
for
it,
but
one
is
that
that...
if
we
had
a
false
tip,
that
would
limit
the
number
of
suspects
when
they
go
out
to
investigate
who
turned
a
false
tip.
so...
so
i
would
say
that...
that
if
enough
details
are
verified
to
say
this
tipster
knew
this
person
and
knew
enough
about
a
situation
so
that
we
know,
yes,
this
is
the
person
they're
talking
about.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
justice
o'connor,
i
would
suggest,
as
we
have
in
brief,
that
basically
the
requirements
should
be
the
same
except
that
in
the
case
of
a
bomb
or
something
you've
got
exigency.
and
that
justifies
excusing
the...
the
verification
which
is,
of
course,
is
wide
of
this
case.
but
the
point
is
everyone
agrees
that
if
these
officers
had
gotten
a
bomb
tip
and
said,
you
know,
vanessa...
there's
a
bomb
in
vanessa
rose
white's
car,
such
and
such...
everything
else...
if
they
had
gone
right
out
there
and
searched
the
car,
that
would
have
been
fine.
and
that...
and
it
would
have
been,
because
the
exigency
would
excuse
the
verification.
but
normally
that
would
be
required.
again,
everybody
seems
to
agree
on
that.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
describes
her
clothes
and
the
car
in
exact
detail?
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
that
would
be
enough
to
say
that
whoever
it
is
knows
this
person.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
okay.
now--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--well,
again,
we
don't
engage
it
in
the
same
thing.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
see--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--justice
white,
i
don't
think
anybody
would
know.
that's
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said.
that
this
is
generally
known
to
the
public.
but
i
don't
think
the
public
is
privy
to
an
ordinary
citizen's
everyday
moving
from
a
house
to
a
hotel.
that
would
have
to
be
someone
who
knows
this
person
and...
and...
and
there...
you
know,
what
that
tells
us
is
they
know
something
about
this
person.
and
if
they
have
taken
the
trouble
and
called
the
police
and
said
this
person
is
carrying
controlled
substances,
they're
running
a
risk,
of
course.
anyone...
i
mean,
these
people
are
anonymous,
but
that's
no
guarantee
the
police
can't
identify
them.
and
they're
running
a
risk
of
facing
criminal
charges
and
civil
charges...
i
mean,
ostracized
by
society
and
all
this.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
that,
again...
i
mean,
that
would
be--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--that's
right.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
but
they
know
her
as
vanessa
rose
white.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
right.
but
the
point
is
with
this
situation
if
the
tip
is
false,
and
that's
one...
one...
not
the
only
reason...
but
one
reason
for
the
verification
is
we're
down
to
a
limited
number
of
suspects,
and
the
person
would
have
to
know
that
the
police
are
going
to
pursue
them
for
giving
a
totally
false
tip.
they're
open
to
civil
suit
and
that
sort
of
thing.
that's
what
gives
the
tip
some
veracity.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
that
would...
that
would
open
them
up
to
that.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
they
did
find
controlled
substances,
though.
and
they
did
find
cocaine
on
her
person,
in
her
purse.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
that's
right,
sir.
but
what
we
have
to
justify
is
the
stopping
of
the
car,
and
they
didn't
find
that
until
afterward.
this
court
from
time
immemorial,
and
quite
logically,
has
said
you
can't
get
a
search
upheld
by
what
you
find.
of
course,
the
converse
would
have
to
true.
if
they
were
justified--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
well,
again,
yes.
again,
that's
not...
you
know,
i'm
not
here
to
defend
that
today
but
that's
always
accepted.
the
telephone
call
that
says
there's
a
bomb
and
out
they
go,
swat
team
and
army
bomb
dispose
and
everything
else.
and
everyone
says...
all
the
commentators...
that's
fine.
and
yet,
you
know,
if
it's
drugs,
many
commentators
say,
no,
you
can't
do
it
if
it's
drugs.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
if
an
anonymous
tip
has
any
probative
value
at
all,
it's
going
to
be
the
same.
and...
and
of
course--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--no,
i'm
making...
i'm
suggesting
that
the
seriousness
of
what
the
anonymous
tipster
alleges
is
not...
does
not
affect
the
value
of
the
tip.
in
other
words,
if
a
person
calls
up
and,
and
says
there's
a
bomb,
that
doesn't
make
it
more
likely
to
be
true
than
if
he
calls
up
and
says
there's...
there's
drugs.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
in
that
situation,
no,
sir,
because--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--well...
my
position
is...
i
mean,
that
would
not
bother
me
if
the
court
was
to
say,
you
don't
have
to
verify
it.
but--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--well,
the
fact--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--it
does...
it
does
not...
it
makes
a
difference
as
to
exigency,
as
to
the
need
to
move.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
no,
sir,
it's
not.
this
court...
this
court
has
recognized
exigency
as
justifying
excusing
a
search
warrant.
officers
go
out
and
under
certain
circumstances...
i
mean,
you
know,
they're
supposed
to
always
get
a
search
warrant.
certain
circumstances
the
need
for
a
search
warrant
is
excused.
here,
you'd
have
the
same
thing.
normally,
the
reasonable
thing
to
do
is
to
check
out
the
tip,
see
if...
if
the...
there's
any
basis
for
believing
the
tipster,
find
out
if...
if
this
tipster
knows
something
about
this
person
and
so
on.
but
you
don't
have
to
do
that...
where
doing
that
might
endanger
human
life
and
limb.
and
i
don't...
no,
sir,
i
don't
think
that's
consistent
at
all.
i
would
say...
and
this
is
consistent...
that
in
both
cases
the
probative
value
of
the
tip
is
the
same.
the
difference
is
that
reasonably
you
should
take
greater
and
more
rapid
action
with
regard
to
something
that
poses
an
imminent
danger
to
human
life
and
limb.
and
it's
not
unreasonable
to
require
that
they
verify
a
tip
that
involved
drugs
which
do
not
create
a
present,
now,
immediate
danger.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
i
know
of
one
case
where
that
was
done,
and...
and
it
really
is
not
completely
logical
except
that
it
is
traditional
and
it
does
look
to
the
legislature
as
the
determiner
of
the
seriousness
of
the
crime.
that's
a
distinction
many
courts
and
commentators
make
between
serious
crimes
and
not
serious
crimes.
if
you're
going
to
make
that
distinction,
it
would
make
more
sense
to
say
that
a
serious
crime
is
one
so
defined
by
the
legislature
by
making
it
a
felony
than,
you
know,
just
sit
up
and
take
a
guess
and
say
drugs
are
not
serious
and
murder
is
serious
and
so
on.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
that
was
a
felony.
he
pleaded
guilty
to
two
felonies,
and
the
crime
alleged
by
the
tipster
was
a
felony.
so,
both
cases...
you
know,
we're
doing
felonies
both
ways.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
the
people?
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
right
now?
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
okay.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
all
right.
they
would...
i
would
suggest
that...
that
that's
probably
not
specific
enough
because
there
could
be
a
lot...
the
requirement--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--well,
there's
just
some
people
standing
on
the
street.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--well,
you
get...
the
problem
with
it
is
in
the
case
of
an
investigative
stop,
it's
got
to
be
specific,
and
that's
what
you're
going
to
have
problems
with
there.
now,
if
it's
at
a
time
of
day
when
there's
no
one
else
around
and
there's
two
people
there,
yes,
sir.
that
might
well
be
enough
to
create
a
reasonable
suspicion.
if
it's
at
noon
and
you've
got
all
kinds
of
people
walking
around,
you're
going
to
get
into
a
lack
of
specificity.
you're
not
limiting
it
to
one
person.
you're
creating
a
danger
that
all...
the
same
danger
with
a
general
search
warrant
or
something.
the
danger
that,
you
know,
you're
going
out
and
bringing
in
the
whole
world.
and...
and
that
would
be
the
problem
with
that
type
of
a
situation.
but
it
would
have
to
be
investigated.
you'd
have
to
look
at
the
situation.
i
would
point
out,
of
course,
that
in
gates
neither...
nor
here...
no
one
knew
who
the
tipster
was
or
why
they
should
be
believed
or
why
they
came
forward
with
their
information.
and...
and
this
case
is
exactly
like
gates
in
that
respect.
this
case
differs
from
gates
other
than
in
scope
only
in
that
in
some
instances
this
case
is
a
little
more
specific.
in
gates
the...
the
tipster
said
that
the
gates
would
be
going
to
florida,
which
is
a
big
state.
here,
they
were
going
to
doby's
motel.
in
this
case,
the
tipster
said
cocaine
and
here...
in
gates,
he
said
drugs.
mr.
marston,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
facts,
if
i
may,
over
here?
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
the
record
does
not
tell
you
that,
sir,
but
i
can
tell
you
if
you'd
like
to
know.
they
were
in...
these
were
narcotics
officers
in
an
unmarked
car.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
and
they
didn't
have
a
light
and
probably
a
rather
strange
car.
i
think
any
person
probably
seeing
some
narcotics
officers
motioning
to
get
over
would
think
they
were,
you
know,
in
danger.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
they
used
the
second
car.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
well,
that
record
also
doesn't
explain
that.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
but
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
probably
they
figured
one
she
got
in
the
motel...
of
course,
the
tip
would
have
been
exhausted
at
that
point
because
the
tipster
said
she
would
be
going
to
the
motel
and
that's
all.
so,
they
might
have
thought
that--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--mobile...
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yeah--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--no,
it's
not
limited
access.
it's
a
very,
very
busy
city
boulevard.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
both
of
these
streets...
all
the
streets
involved
are.
but
i
believe
what
happened
was
they...
they
said,
all
right,
we're
going
to
have
to
stop
her
and
they
called
this
patrol
car
and
simply
were
not
able
to
do
it
in
a
surgical
fashion.
the
patrol
car
moved
in
and
made
the
stop
and...
and
she
happened
to
be
in
front
of
the
jet
motel...
i
mean
drive-in.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
all
right.
justice
marshall,
the
reason
for
that
was,
first
of
all,
when
she
first
came
out
of
the
apartment--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--all
of
that
time,
from
the
time
she
got
out
of
the
car
up
until
the
time
she
got
almost
to
doby's,
they
were...
they
were
verifying
the
things
that
this
informer
had
told
them.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
they
didn't
see
a
bag
when
she
came
out
of
the
building.
the
bag
was
already
in
the
car.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
no,
sir.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
because
that
is
where
the
tipster
said
that
the
cocaine--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--well,
that
would
have
been
fine,
but
at
that
point,
justice
marshall,
they
had
relatively
little
verification.
they
had
the
fact
that
she
had
come
out
of
this
particular
apartment
building
at
that
time.
now--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--the
fact
that
she
got
that
brown
plymouth
station
wagon
with
the
broken
right
tail
light
and
then
headed
to
doby's
motel.
they
were
just
adding
verification.
now,
you...
you
might
well
be
right,
justice
marshall.
perhaps
they
could
have
stopped
her
coming
out
of
the--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--out
of
the
apartment
right
there.
but
i
would
suggest
that...
that,
you
know,
we
should
compliment
officers
for
being
more
cautious,
for
being,
you
know,
developing
things
more
rather
than
moving
in
at
the
first
opportunity.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
i
don't
have--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--no,
sir.
the
doby
motel
is
four...
a
little
less
than
four
miles
from
where
she
started
and
it's
a
circuitous--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--circuitous.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
it
goes
down
one,
two,
three,
four
turns.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
and
it's
not...
it's
a
relatively
small
motel.
it
would
be...
i
can't
give
you
the
mathematical
probability,
but
it
would
be
astronomical
that
a
person
not
intended
by
the...
by
the
informer
would
get
in
the
car
and...
and
do
all
the...
get
in
that
car,
get
in
that--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--possibly.
possibly.
but
they
did
not
do
that.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
no,
sir.
it's
not
necessary
to
our
case
because
all
they
did
was
stop
the
car
and
ask
her
permission
to
search.
now,
they
did
ask
her
to
get
out
of
the
car
and
move
to
the
rear.
but
they...
of
course,
that
isn't
what
produced
the
evidence,
number
one.
and
it--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--well,
it
justifies
a
stop
because
it
creates...
it
is
articulable,
objective
reasons
that
this
specific
person
is
engaged
in
criminal
activity.
now,
as
far
as
your...
your
basic
question...
what
were
they
planning
to
do...
this
court
in
terry
ruled
that
when
an
officer
has
these
reasonable
articulable
suspicions
and
so
on
that
the
officer
may
stop
the
person
in
question.
now,
of
course,
common
sense
tells
us
it
would
be
a
most
remarkable
situation
where
the
person
made
a
full
confession.
usually
what
happens
in
the
investigatory
stop
situation
is...
and
this
is
really
i
think
the
beauty
of
terry...
is
that
if
it's
an
innocent
person,
they
do
just
that.
they
tell
the
officer
who
they
are.
what
are
you
doing
here?
well,
i'm
looking
for
my
cat
or
whatever.
if
it's
a
if
it's
a
person
with
something
to
hide,
that
commonly
they'll
do
something
else.
very
commonly
they
will
flee
or
they
will
abandon
the
contraband
and
that
sort
of
thing.
in
this
case,
ms.
white
just
stopped
the
car
and
did
what
the
officers
asked.
so
about
all
they
were
left
with
was
to
say,
may
we
search
your
car?
and
she
said
yes.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
we're...
we're
back
to--
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
--justice
scalia's
question.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
that
if
seeing...
and
they
had
at
that
point
seen
the
attache
case
in
plain
view...
if
that
was
enough
to
turn
this
to
probable
cause,
yes,
they
would
have
been
justified
in
searching.
otherwise,
it
would
have
been,
good
afternoon,
ms.
white.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
i
have
always...
and
i
cannot
cite
a
case
on
this
that
this
court
has
handed
down
analogous
rulings...
but
i
have
always
taken
the
position
in...
in
training
police
officers
that
you
cannot
cite
the
invocation
of
a
constitutional
right
as
evidence
of
guilt.
so,
i
would
say,
no,
sir.
thank
you
so
much.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
your
honor,
i
did
not
plan
to
have
any,
but
i
would
be
happy
to
answer
any
additional
questions
the
court
might
have.
mr.
joseph
g.
l.
marston,
iii
thank
you,
your
honor.
