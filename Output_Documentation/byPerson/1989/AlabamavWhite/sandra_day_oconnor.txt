i
thought
the
stop
was
made
before
arrival
at
the
motel.

so,
we
don't
know
if
the
destination
was
the
motel.
justice

but
not
at
the
motel?
justice

so,
you
don't
have
that
factor
to
rely
on.
justice
o'connor
what
do
you
think
the
test
is
for
reliability
of
anonymous
tips?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
many
of
the
factors
and
what
factors?
justice
o'connor
does
it
make
any
difference
in
your
view
if
it's
a
potentially
dangerous
crime?
for
instance,
an
anonymous
tip
that
somebody
in
an
airport
or
airplane
is
carrying
a
bomb
that's
going
to
be
detonated.
how
much
is
required
there?
and
is
more
required
for
a
drug
stop?
