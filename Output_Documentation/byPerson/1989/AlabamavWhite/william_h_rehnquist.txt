chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
89-789,
alabama
v.
vanessa
rose
white.
mr.
marston.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
tipster
also
say
that
she
would
do
that
at
a
particular
time
of
day?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
talk
about--
--would
you
distinguish
between
a
felony
and
a
misdemeanor?
at
common
law
they
distinguished,
didn't
they,
between
the
circumstances
under
which
you
might...
an
officer
or
citizen
might
arrest
and
some
of
that
distinction
turned
on
felony
versus
misdemeanor.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
was
the
crime
to
which
the
respondent
here
pleaded
guilty...
was
that
a
felony
or
a
misdemeanor
under
alabama
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
marston.
mr.
byrne,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
they...
they
had
someone
emerging
from
235-c
lynwood
terrace
apartments,
and
they
had
it
at
a
certain
time
of
day,
which
certainly
suggests
that
the
informant
knew
something
about
the
movements
of
the
person.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--in
the
opinion
of
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals,
which
is
at
page
22,
23,
24
of
the...
what
is
it,
the
petition
+/?
the
alabama
court
of
appeals
says
that
corporal
davis
received
a
phone
call
from
an
anonymous
person
stating
that
vanessa
white
would
be
leaving
235-c
lynwood
terrace
apartments
at
a
particular
time
in
a
brown
plymouth
station
wagon.
now,
i
thought
you
just
said
that
the
tip
was
that
she
would
be
leaving
that
area?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i'm
talking
about
the
opinion...
we're
reviewing
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
chief
justice
rehnquist
again,
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals
says
the
officers
observed
appellant
leave
the
235
building.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you...
you
say
they
saw...
they
saw
her
observe
the
building
but
not
the
235-c?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
gates,
too,
was
a
probable
cause
case,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
the
law
should
not
protect
the
officer
in
that
case
if
he
is
sued
for
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
doesn't
really
answer
my
question.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
a...
and
a
court
would
find
that
he
violated
the
fourth
amendment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but...
but
you
don't...
you
don't
need
a
warrant
for
a...
for
a
terry
stop.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
you're
talking
about
going
before
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
to
get
an
arrest
warrant
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
byrne.
mr.
marston,
do
you
have
a
rebuttal?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
apparently,
there
are
none.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
