mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court:
the
core
issue
in
this
case
is
to
what
degree
may
a
police
officer
rely
upon
an
anonymous
tip
informing
reasonable,
articulable
suspicion
necessary
to
justify
a
terry
stop.
we
respectfully
suggest
that
in
the...
facts
in
this
case
did
not
rise
to
that
level
of
articulable
suspicion.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
reasonable
suspicion
requires
more
than
minimal
corroboration
of
innocent
details.
there
were
at
least
four
spots
in
this
factual
scenario
where
the
police
officers
probably
could
have
gotten
that
reasonable
suspicion
but
did
not
for
various
reasons.
a
reference
to
our
brief
at
page
33
and
34,
i
set
forth
or
seek
to
set
forth
12
deficiencies
in
this...
in
these
facts
that
fail
to
meet
the
reasonable
articulable
suspicion
required
for
a
terry-type
stop.
and
in
this
case
we
began
with
the
premise
that
the
officers
knew
nothing
about
their
informant.
during
the
suppression
hearing
officer
davis
candidly
admitted
that
he
had
no
facts
to
determine
the
credibility,
the
believability,
the
veracity
of
his
informant.
and
secondly,
he
had
no
facts
upon
which
he,
as
an
officer,
could
rely
upon
in
determining
whether
there
was
a
factual
basis
for
his
knowledge.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
i
think
one
might
look
to
see
if--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
because
i
would
have...
i
would
have
a
suspicion,
an
articulable
suspicion.
well,
i
think
at
that
point,
your
honor,
that
you
would
probably
be
there
because
you
were
both
curious
as
to
why
the
tomatoes
were
missing
and
also
wanting
to
find
if
the
culprit
might
show
up
that
night,
but
you
didn't
have
the
factual
basis.
in
this
case,
i
think
the
key
element
that's
missing,
judge...
justice...
is
the
fact
that
we
do
not
have
any
description
as
a
threshold
matter
of
vanessa
white.
if
they
had
given
a
detailed
description
or,
second,
if
the
officers
knew
who
vanessa
white
was...
but
in
this
case
any
lady
could
have
entered
that
brown
plymouth
station
wagon
with
a
broken
right
tail
light
and
that's
what
they
had.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--chief
justice
rehnquist,
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
at
page
16,
i
think
that
there
is
not
a
suggestion
that
the
person
later
identified
as
vanessa
white
came
from
that
particular
apartment,
but
rather
she
would
be...
the
fact
the
informant
gave
would
be
that
she
would
be
leaving
the
area.
now,
i
think
that
is
substantially
different
from
leaving
a
particular
apartment.
in
this
case,
had
the
informant...
or
had
the
officer
gotten
there
and
had
simply
said,
let
me
call
the
gas
company
or
let
me
call
and
see
if,
during
this
hour
of
passage
of
time,
if
vanessa
white
actually
rented
235-c,
or
if
they
had
determined
that
in
this
case
the
brown
plymouth
station
wagon
was
registered
to
vanessa
white--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--but
they
didn't
do
either.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
yes,
sir,
at
page
16
of
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--i
agree,
sir,
that
is...
chief
justice,
that
is
what
it
says.
i
believe
it
to
be
factually
in
error.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
but
it
is--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
the
cross-examination
of
corporal
davis,
beginning
on
page
13
of
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--i
think
that
if
the
court
does
that,
it
would
not
change
the
result
because
in
this
case
the
officers
did
not
verify
that
the
lady
who
appeared
and
ultimately
got
in
the
brown
plymouth
station
wagon
came
from
235-c.
had
they
done
that,
i
think
it
would
have
been
helpful.
but
they
were
outside,
in
effect,
surveilling
the
brown
plymouth
station
wagon.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
yes,
sir.
that
building,
your
honor,
houses
more
than
one
apartment.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
yes,
sir,
not
the
particular
apartment.
as
i
understand
it,
the
officers
took
up
a
position
of
surveillance
and
observed...
observing
both
the
235
building
and
the
brown
plymouth
station
wagon
which
was
parked
in
front
of
the
building.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
i
think
that--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--i
think
that
would
be
still
pretty
minimal
corroboration,
your
honor,
because
in
this
case,
absent
a
specific
description,
we
don't
know
who
was
getting
into
that
vehicle.
we
do
not
know
that
it
was
vanessa
white.
we
simply
know
that
it
was
a
lady
that
entered
the
vehicle.
a
detailed
description...
and
as
justice
white
suggested...
if
we
had
the
kind
of
description
initially
given
in
draper...
now,
draper's
facts
of
course
were...
were
probable
cause
facts...
but
i
think
it's
significant
also
that
that
was
a
known
informant...
in
fact,
a
paid...
a
paid
special
employee.
but
in
that
case,
they
described
the
gentleman
who
would
be
leaving
the
train,
draper,
coming
back
to
denver
from
chicago,
as
being
a
black
male,
five,
eight,
160,
wearing
brown
pants,
black
shoes,
carrying
a
tan
briefcase.
now,
the
visual
observation
then
of
the
officer
who
saw
a
person
fitting
that
exact
description,
coupled
with
the
further
detail
that
that
person,
draper,
would
be
moving
at
a
rapid
pace,
brisk
walk.
and,
indeed,
the
person
fitting
that
description,
with
that
walk,
did
get
off
the
train
from
chicago
in
the...
the
denver
terminal.
and
under
those
circumstances...
and
i
will
grant
to
the
justice
that
that
was
a
probable
cause
for
arrest
and
search.
because
they
found,
in
fact,
the
contraband
on
draper
that
day.
but
in
this
case
i
think
we
have
to
go
back
to
justice
white's
opinion
in
jernigan
v.
louisiana
where
he
dissented
from
a
denial
of
cert.,
and
as
he
focuses
the
critical
issue
there
he
asked
us
and
draws
our
attention
to
the
specificity
of
the
information
provided,
the
independent
corroboration
by
the
police.
in
here
the
corroboration
is
extraordinarily
minimal.
and
third,
the
danger
to
the
public,
which
gets
back
to
the...
to
the
observation
of
two
of
the
justices
of
the
court.
now,
in
gates
justice
white
was
reluctant.
and
granted,
gates
was
a
case
that
wanted
to
foster
the
warrant
process.
but
at
least
in
that
case
gates...
justice
white
in
gates
was
reluctant
to
prove
any
standard
which
did
not
require
a
showing
of
the
facts
from
which
an
inference
might
be
drawn,
first,
that
the
informant
was
credible
or
believable
and,
secondly,
was
that
information
obtained
in
a
reliable
fashion.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
yes,
sir,
no
question
about
it.
but
i
differ
from
my
brother
in
saying
that
the
facts
in
gates
in
my
judgment
were
extraordinarily
different.
and
this
is
not
a
mini-gates
factual
scenario.
the
facts
in
gates
involved
the
verification
by
a
police
officer
of
eight
separate
facts
dealing
from
unique
travel
arrangements,
where
sue
gates
would
drive,
lance
gates
would
fly.
the
destination:
west
palm
beach,
florida.
in
fact,
within
24
hours
of
the
time
predicted,
passage
is
booked.
he
does...
he,
lance
gates,
flies
to
that
location.
he
goes
directly
to
a
holiday
inn
where
sue
gates
is
registered
there.
the
two
of
them
immediately
leave,
driving
by
a
highway,
an
arterial
highway
that
is
frequently
used
in
going
back
to
bloomingdale,
illinois
and
to
the
chicago
area.
the
length
of
time
in
florida--
now,
as
one
of
the
justices...
and
i
may
be
wrong
in
this,
but
i
believe
justice
white
said
this...
this
wasn't
innocent
activity.
this
was
suspicious
as
the
dickens.
and
i...
i
would
tend
to
agree
with
that,
because
this
is--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
sir.
but
at
any
rate,
i
would
suggest
that
this
also
doesn't
reach
the
stop
situation
that
the
chief
justice's
opinion
in
sokolow
addressed
late
in
1989
because
there,
de
agents...
dea
agents,
excuse
me...
observed
and
verified
with
their
own
eyes
and
senses
six
objective
characteristics
of
a
drug
courier.
and
that
was
the
$2,100
in
cash
from
a
roll
of
20s;
they
travelled
under
an
assumed
name;
the
destination
at
miami
was
a
source
city
for
drugs;
they
stayed
in
miami
48
hours
and
it
takes
20
hours
to
simply
fly
there
and
get
on
the
plane
and
fly
back;
apparent
nervousness;
and
he
checked
none
of
the
luggage.
i
also
would
like
to
digress
and
go
back
to
gates
because
i
left
out
something.
when
my
brother
suggests
there
was
totally
innocent
activity
in
gates,
let
me
suggest
that
suspicion
also
should
have
been
generated
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
lance
gates
was
using
switched
plates
on
the
vehicle
that
went
back
to
bloomingdale.
it
was
a
plate,
albeit
registered
to
him,
but
it
was
a
plate
for
a
different
kind
of
car...
i
believe
a
hornet
automobile,
as
opposed
to
the
mercury
that
he
was
driving.
in
total,
though,
and
in
sum,
i
would
suggest
that...
that
we've
got
far
more
verification,
reasonable
suspicion,
articulable
suspicion
in
sokolow
than
are
present
in
these
facts.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
i
think
reasonably
articulable
suspicion
is
a
standard
that
is
reasonably
fixed,
but
i
think
reasonable
men,
dependent
upon
what
the
crime
is,
must
react
differently.
and
if
we've
got
the
danger
to
the
public
as
being
the
third
criteria
that
justice
white
suggests,
when
you
get
the
area
of
bomb
in
a
possible
motel,
then
whether
or
not
you
make
a
particular
criminal
case
"in
a
neat,
tight
package.
"
or
you
preserve
life,
we
must,
as
a
society,
preserve
life.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
no,
sir.
once
again,
i
don't
think--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
i
care.
i
think
what
i
would
do
in
that
case
is
if
i
were
the
police
officer
on
the
street,
given
those
facts,
i
would
preserve
life
and
then
run
the
risk
that
i
couldn't
make
my
case.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
i
don't
think
there
is
reasonably
articulable
suspicion.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
in
my...
in
my...
in
my
judgment,
your
honor,
given
those...
those
facts,
i
believe
that
his
true
exposure
to
suit
would
be
de
minimis.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
if
the
question
is
could
he
be
sued,
yes,
sir,
it
could
be.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
if
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
terry
stop
as
opposed
to
a
complete
search,
i
think
that
would
break
a
difference.
but
i
think,
as
the
chief
justice
suggests,
that
what
you
would
have
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment
seizure
provision,
and
i
think
there
is
a
technical
violation.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
your
honor,
there
is
no
question
that...
that
drugs
are
a
serious
national
concern.
i
think,
though,
when
we
talk
about
fourth
amendment
restrictions,
however,
i
think
we've
got
to
be
cognizant
of
the
crime
but...
but
i
think
the
core
problem
here
is
you've
got
the
danger
of
anonymity
without
accountability.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
think...
i
think
that
the
question
there
is,
of
course,
they're...
they're
afraid
that
if
they're...
they
are
disclosed,
they
may
be
burned.
and
i
think
that's
the
common
parlance.
i
think...
i
think,
however,
that
what
you're
doing
is
we're
trying
to
balance
the
right...
the
right
of
the
citizen
as
opposed,
in
this
case,
to
the
informant.
let
me
suggest
that
both,
as
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
and
as...
and
as
a
defense
counsel,
i've
seen
numerous
requests
for
disclosure
of
informants.
and
it
has
been
my
experience,
respectfully,
that
courts
and
judges
do
not
grant
that.
and
i,
at
least
in
my
experience,
limited
though
it
may
be,
i
have
never
seen
a
judge
disclose
a
confidential
informant.
but
that
is
a
very
clear
danger.
and
it
is
any
time
when
police
rely
upon
informant
activity.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
i
think
that
is...
i
think
that
is
clearly...
clearly
true.
but
i
think
that
this
court
has
in
adams
v.
williams
case
at
least
expressed
some
concern
about
anonymity
without
accountability,
because
the
chief
justice
in
answering
those
questions
points
out
in
the
four
factors
that
he
gives
at
least
twice
the
fact
that
the
informant
was
known,
had
provided
information
in
the
past
and,
most
critically,
would
have
been
subject
to
criminal
prosecution.
i
do
beg
to
differ
from
my
co-counsel
in
that
in
this
case,
this
informant
would
not
have
been
subject
to
criminal
prosecution
because
the
officer
said
he
did
not
know
who
that
person
was,
and
they
had
not
heard
from
that
individual
subsequently.
and
that
the
informant
was
not
"known"
to
the
montgomery
police
department.
the
linchpin
of
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
court
will
approve
a
stop
and
a
detention
of
a
citizen
based
upon
an
information
provided
by
an
anonymous
tipster
who
is
not
held
to
a
standard
of
accountability
and
where
the
corroboration
of
the
details
is
minimal.
in
this
case,
as
pointed
out
by
justice
o'connor,
had
they
allowed
the
vehicle
to
get
and
even
turn
into
the
motel,
if
the
officer
had
approached
and
said,
my
name
is
patrolman
david
byrne,
may
i
see
your
license,
please,
ma'am,
and
that
license
turned
out
to
be
vanessa
white
and
she
had
made
the
turn
into
the
doby
motel
at
a
minimum,
i
believe,
given
all
of
the
facts
under
these
circumstances,
you
would
have
had
reasonably
articulable
suspicion.
i
do
not
believe
that
we
got
to
that
level.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
at
this
point,
i
think
they
clearly...
they
had
a
reason
to
under
our
code
to
have
done
it
without
regard
to
the
reason
they
gave
for
the
stop.
the
officer--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--broken
tail
light.
in
this
case,
though,
the
officer
was
very
candid
and
when
he
said...
when
he
identified
himself,
he
simply
said,
we
suspect
that
you
are
carrying
drugs
in
the
car.
and
they
also
observed
that
she
was...
it
was
filled
with
clothes
as
if
she
were
moving.
and
at
that
point,
officer
reynolds,
his
partner,
gets...
begins
to
go
through
the
car.
they
find
the
brown
briefcase.
they
ask
her
for
permission
or
consent
to
open
the
combination
lock
on
it
and
inside
they
find
a
quantity
of
marijuana.
in
this
case
the
record
does
not
disclose,
but
it
was--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
i
think
at
this
point
we
have
to.
the
question
is,
was
the
stop
a
valid
stop
and
was
there
reasonably
articulable
suspicion?
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
in
my
view,
justice
white,
this
is
more
akin
to
an
arrest
than
it
was
a
stop.
i
don't
see
any
of
the
indicia
of
a
terry
stop--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--given
the--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
yes,
sir,
and
given...
given
the
opinion
of
the
alabama
court
of
criminal
appeals,
they
reached
and
attacked
this
question
only
as
a
stop
case,
not
as
an
arrest
situation.
once
we
leave
the
determination
of
reasonable
suspicion
to
a
police
officer
guided
by
a
concept
as
amorphous
as
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
we
have
a
very
difficult
situation
because
the
officer
whose
responsibility
it
is
to
ferret
out
crime
and
enforce
the
law
is...
is
in
an
very
difficult
circumstance.
and
the
totality
of
the
circumstance's
test,
where
it's
being
determined
by
mutual
and
detached
magistrate,
is
a
far
greater
guarantor
of
fourth
amendment
protections
than
giving
the
anonymous...
excuse
me...
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
test
to
the
police
officer
to
determine
for
himself
if
his
tipster--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--no,
sir.
absolutely
not.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
no,
sir.
if
i
gave...
made
that
suggestion,
i
was
in
error,
because
i'm
not.
gates
simply
dealt
with
a
warrant
situation
where
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
supplanted
or
replaced
in
part
aquilar
and
spinelli's
two-pronged
test.
i
would
suggest
that
reading
the
opinions
of
the
gates'
court,
however,
we
did
not
completely
abdicate
or
banish
those
considerations
as
factors
among
the
totality
of
the
circumstances.
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
for...
that
to
be
my
reading
of
teller...
terry
when
i
couple
it
with--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
i
believe
so.
as
i
recall
in
delaware
v.
prowse,
there--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
and
i...
i
understand
now
the
distinction
you're
making.
in
an
automobile
stop
there,
that
was
different
in
the
sense
that
we...
the...
in
the
analogy
your
gave,
the
vehicle
has
coming
to
a
stop,
she's
getting
ready
to
go
to
the
drug
store.
but
in
terry--
mr.
david
b.
byrne,
jr.
--excuse
me,
but
in
this
case,
in
terry,
the
officer,
who
was
a
trained
officer
for
many
years
of
experience,
observed
suspicious
activity
independent
of
whatever
she
did.
and
i
think
that
makes
a
difference,
sir,
because
there
it
looked
as
if
they
were
casing
the
joint
for
some
period
of
time
before
they
approached
terry
and
his
friends,
asked
for
their
names,
and
they
mumbled
something,
reached
for
the
pocket
and
the
officer
put
his
hand
in
there.
and
at
that
point,
of
course,
this
court
upheld
terry.
but
terry
was
defined
in
the
narrowest
possible
terms
by
the
chief
justice.
is
it
always
unreasonable?
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
we
have
not
moved
beyond
that
narrow
framework
of
terry
by
reason
of
the...
the
time
that
has
passed.
thank
you.
