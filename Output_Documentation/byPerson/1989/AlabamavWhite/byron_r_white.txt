justice
white
also,
there
the
question
is
probable
cause.
justice
white
and...
and
this
case
is...
you
say
reasonable
suspicion?
justice
white
suppose
the
anonymous
tipster
says
that...
that
vanessa
white
is
going
to
leave
the
building
at
a
certain
time,
she's
going
to
be
wearing
a
certain...
describes
her
clothes
in
exact
detail,
describes
the
car
in
exact
detail
and...
is
that...
is
that
just
generally
enough?
justice
white
yeah.
justice
white
oh,
yeah,
knows
the
person.
justice
white
but
don't
you
have
to
have
some
basis
for
thinking
that
the
person
knows
what
is
in
the
bag?
justice
white
all...
all...
all--
justice
white
--anybody
could
know
that
this
person
is
going
to
be
driving
down
the
street
to
a
hotel,
but
have
no
basis
whatsoever
for
believing
there
is
something
in
her
handbag.
justice
white
suppose
somebody
calls
up
and
says,
i
just
saw
mrs.
white
leaving
the
building.
she's
wearing
such
and
such
clothes.
she's
carrying
a
brown
briefcase.
she's
getting
into
a
brown
station
wagon,
and
she
has
cocaine
in
her
bag...
handbag.
justice
white
well,
all
it
means
is
that
somebody
saw
her--
justice
white
--get
in
a
car
dressed
so
and
so.
justice
white
oh,
yes.
oh,
yes,
they
certainly
know--
--but
you're
not
relying
on
that
here,
because
they
didn't
ask
for
her
identity.
so
that's
out
of
the
case.
justice
white
but
the
tip
was
false
on
the
crucial--
justice
white
--the
tip
was
false
in
the
sense
that
they
didn't
find
in
the...
in
the
case
what
the
tipster
said
would
be
found.
justice
white
well,
they
didn't
find...
the
tip
was
wrong.
the
tip
was
not
accurate.
justice
white
but
you...
you
do
agree
that
you
have...
know
enough
facts
that...
that...
what
the
tipster...
you
must
eventually
say
that
we
can
conclude
that
the
tipster
knew
this
person
well
enough
to
have
a
reasonable
belief
that
she
had
cocaine
in
the...
in
the
case?
justice
white
i
think
that
we...
we
judge
this
case
as
though
the
consent
was
valid.
justice
white
and
if
it
wasn't
a
valid
stop,
then
the
consent
is
a
fruit?
is
that
it?
justice
white
yeah,
but
what...
what
invalidates
the
consent?
what's
the
basis
for
excluding
the
evidence?
justice
white
it's
the
fact
that
the
stop
is
illegal.
justice
white
and
that...
and
that
the
stop
produced
the
consent.
justice
white
i
suppose
if
they...
if
the...
if
the
lady
had
stopped
at
a
drug
store
on
the
way
to
this
motel
and
the
police
parked
behind
her
and
as
she
got
out
of
the
car,
she
said...
they
said,
excuse
me,
we
think
you're
carrying
drugs,
can...
may
we
search
the...
your
car?
and
she
said,
sure.
may
we
search
this
case...
attache
case?
sure.
there
wouldn't
be
anything
wrong
with
that
i
don't
suppose?
because...
i
suppose
any
policeman
can
walk
up
to
some
person
on
the
street
and
say,
excuse
me,
somebody
tells
me
you're
carrying
drugs
in
your
pocketbook,
may
i
look
at
it.
justice
white
i
know,
but
anybody...
anybody
can
say
excuse
me
and
if
the
person
doesn't
want
to
stop
he
can
just
go
on.
but
if
a
person
stops
and
listens
to
you
and
says,
sure,
you
can
search
my
briefcase,
is
anything
wrong
with
that?
justice
white
that's
an
automobile
stop.
justice
white
xxx
car
and
you
say,
excuse
me.
