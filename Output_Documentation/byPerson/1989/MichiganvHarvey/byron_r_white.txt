justice
white
has
massiah
got
anything
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
white
well,
how
about...
is
massiah
relevant
to
deciding
whether
there
was
a
sixth
amendment
violation?
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
yeah,
but
there
was
a
concern
that
he
had
a
lawyer.
justice
white
well,
if
he
didn't
waive
it...
but
absent
waiver,
there
was
a
sixth
amendment
violation
just
from
the
questioning.
justice
white
well,
do--
justice
white
so,
just
answering
the
questions
didn't
amount
to
a
waiver?
justice
white
if
you
have
a
defendant
who
has
been
given
counsel
and
the
police
know
he's
got
counsel,
you
think
there
is
no
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
if
the
police
go
to
him
and
as
if
he
would
like
to
waive
his
right
to
counsel
and
talk?
justice
white
you
don't
think
it's
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
when
the
defendant
has
counsel
for
the
police
or
the
prosecution
to
approach
the
defendant?
justice
white
of
course,
if
there
would
be
a
sixth
amendment
violation
just
by
the
police
approaching
him,
jackson
wouldn't
have
been
necessary,
i
suppose.
justice
white
well,
wouldn't...
wouldn't
your
argument
be
just
as
strong
if
it
were
just
an
edwards'
violation?
justice
white
well,
the...
the
police
would
have
every...
the
same...
the
same
possible
urge
to
go
ahead
and
question,
knowing
that
they
could
use
the
forbidden
statements
for
impeachment.
justice
white
they
would
also
find
out
how
he
responds
to
questions,
what
his
demeanor
is.
justice
white
no.
that's
just
a--
justice
white
--that's
just
a
difference
in
language
as
far
as
the
possible
advantage
to
the
state
is
concerned.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--well,
for
edwards
to
take...
for
edwards
to
take
hold
at
all,
there
has
to
be
an
assertion
of
the
right
to
counsel.
after
an
assertion
you
can't...
the
police
can't
go
back
to
him.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
the--
justice
white
--but
the
rights
certainly
attach
then
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
under
the
fifth
amendment
to--
justice
white
--to...
for
the
lawyer
to
be
there
and
the
police
weren't
supposed
to
talk
to
him.
justice
white
but
they
went
ahead
and
talked
to
him.
justice
white
well,...
there
is
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
somewhere
in
this
process
you
started
to
argue
about
why
the...
why
the
statement
that
was
taken
could
not
be
used
for
impeachment.
why
is
that?
why
is
this
case
different
from
walder
and
the
fourth
amendment
cases
and
the
miranda
cases?
justice
white
what's
the
difference
between
this
and
the
miranda/edwards
situation?
justice
white
yeah,
but
in
terms
of
the
theory
of
our
cases
that...
allowing
the
use
of
this
illegally-taken
evidence
for
impeachment,
i
don't
see
why
the
rationale
of
those
cases...
or,
maybe
you
can
tell
me
why
the
rationale
of
those
cases
doesn't
apply
here.
justice
white
the
defendant
is
testifying
on
the
stand
and
he...
and
he
testifies
quite
contrary
to
some
statement
he
made
to
the
police.
justice
white
i
know.
but
it
were,
your
argument
would
cover
that
like
a
blanket.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
so
you
think
the
balance
should
come
out
differently?
