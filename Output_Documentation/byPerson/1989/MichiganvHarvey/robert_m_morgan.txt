mr.
robert
m.
morgan
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
respondent
submits
that
this
case
involves
the
essence,
the
absolute
unqualified
essence
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel.
there
is
no
question
the
right
had
attached;
respondent
was
formally
charged.
there
is
no
question
that
he
asserted
that
right;
he
requested
an
attorney.
that
attorney
then
stood
as
the
medium,
as
this
court
has
indicated
in
jackson,
between
the
state
and
the
respondent
for
all
contacts.
there
is
no
question,
then,
notwithstanding
that
medium,
not
withstanding
that
assertion
of
the
right
to
counsel,
the
state
interfered
with
that
right.
the
state
interfered
concededly,
deliberately--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--the
violation
occurred
both,
justice
connor--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--o'connor.
i'm
sorry,
justice.
at
the
time
of
the
interference.
but
i
don't
think
that
ends
the
analysis.
i
think
the
next
step
is
to
look
to
see
is
there
prejudice.
or,
in
other
words,
did
the
state
gain
some
advantage.
did
the
state
use
it,
and
not
just
use
it
in
the
sense
of,
as
the
solicitor
general
argued
in
the
amicus
brief,
that,
well,
they
only
used
it
in
essence
to
generate
impeachment
and
that's
not
so
bad.
well,
there
are
many
uses.
the
example
of
put
respondent
in
the
witness
chair
and
ask
him
a
few
questions
and
size
him
up
is
a
use
which
is
to
the
state's
advantage.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
a
defendant
can
waive
his
sixth
amendment
right,
certainly,
but
after
assertion
of
the
right
then
it
is
respondent's
position
that
counsel
has
some
role
in
that
waiver.
and
i
think
that's
the
essential
notion
that
was
contained
in
michigan--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--there
is...
and
i
don't
think
there
could
be,
frankly.
the
record
is
insufficient--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--no,
not
on
the
record
because
the
state
also
concedes...
they
concede
the
sixth
amendment
violation.
they
concede
a
miranda
defective
admonition.
and
by
virtue
of
that,
then,
i
think
implicitly
there
cannot
be
a
waiver
of
the
sixth
amendment
right.
but
it
is...
a
violation
may
occur
at
the
time
of
interference
by
the
state.
but
it
is
then...
the
next
step
is
prejudice.
was
there
some
use...
did
the
state
gain
an
advantage?
you
could
have
a
violation,
no
question...
a
sixth
amendment
violation
but
no
prejudice
to
defendant,
no
use.
weatherford
v.
percy,
albeit
in
a
civil
context,
is
an
example.
undercover
officer
acting
under
cover
posing
as
a...
as
a
defendant,
intruding
in
the
attorney-client
relationship
and
intruding
in
the
defense
camp.
but,
of
course,
the
court
said
that
certainly
there
was
a
violation.
but
there
was
no
prejudice
because
the
officer
never,
never
shared
anything
he
learned
with
the
prosecutor.
consequently
there
was
no
prejudice,
there
was
no
use.
but
there
are
many
ways
in
which
the
state
can
engage
in
a
sixth
amendment
violation
here
and
gain
an
advantage
or
prejudice--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--no,
i
don't
believe
so
because--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--well,
i
think--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--i
think,
thought,
edwards
involved
a
prophylactic
rule.
here
we're
talking
about
the
substantive--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--constitutional
amendment.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
well,
it's
a
critical
difference
in
language
because
in
edwards
certainly
there
had
been
no
assertion
of
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
edwards
is
a
prophylactic
rule
which--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--but
in
edwards
i
believe
it
was
an
assertion
of
right
to
counsel
in
a
fifth
amendment
context.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
and
some
would
say--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--the
right--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--the
right--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--the
right
to
counsel
in
that
context
attached.
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
to
have
the
lawyer
serve
as
the
medium
for
all
contacts
between
the
state
and
the
defendant
had
not
attached.
there
are
many--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--that,
we
submit,
is
the
essence
of
the
court's
holding
in
michigan
v.
jackson.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
that
is
core
sixth
amendment,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
well,
because
it
is...
that...
you're
approaching
the
defendant
in
the
context
of
the
adversarial
process.
you're
approaching
the
defendant
at
a
time
after
the
defendant
has
asserted
that
right
and
by
asserting
that
right
has
said,
i
realize
i
cannot
deal
with
the
state,
i
am
incapable
of
dealing
with
the
state.
that's
what
the
assertion
of
the
right
to
counsel
means.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
it
is
the
presence
of
counsel
at
that
critical
stage
which
is
the
core
of
the
sixth
amendment.
counsel
should
be
there
at
the
time
the
state
approaches
the
defendant
and
asks
him
to
seek
to
waive
his
right.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
in
michigan
v.
jackson
the
court
uses...
makes
repeated
reference
to
police-initiated--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--in
this
case,
though,
the
state
concedes
that
michigan
v.
jackson
is--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--but
i
think
the
thrust
of
jackson
is
that
waiver
in
that
context
must
be
an
exacting
waiver
and
the
court
speaks
of
johnson
v.
zerbst.
certainly,
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
a
defendant
from
pleading
guilty
in
a
case,
but
we
would
not
countenance
a
plea
proceeding
where
the
defendant--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--it
raises
a
troubling
contradiction.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
the
notion
that...
contained
in
jackson
that
in
spite
of
full
complete
miranda
warnings,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
jackson
evidently
made
a
voluntary
statement,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
made
that
statement
knowingly,
intelligently...
a
voluntary
statement
in
compliance
with
miranda...
the
court
still
held
that
because
the
right
to
counsel
had
attached
that
that
waiver
was
not
sufficient.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
well,
the
defendant
is
always
free
to
forgo
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
respondent's
position
would
be
that
the
police
have
an
obligation
to
provide
notice
to
the
defendant's
counsel
that...
that--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--we
rely
in
essence
of
our
reading
of
michigan
v.
jackson.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
well,
it
says
that
there
was
no
valid
waiver.
what
is
the
difference
if
it's
police-initiated
or
defendant-initiated?
the
court--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--but
this
court
in
henry,
for
example,
said
that
within
a
sixth
amendment
context
it
is
irrelevant
who
initiated
the
contact.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
because
the
analogy
to
the
fourth
amendment
is
simply
inappropriate.
the
fourth
amendment
is
a
right
that
all
citizens
have.
it
is
not
a
procedural
right,
such
as
the
sixth
amendment.
it
does
not
extend
to
the
integrity
of
the
trial
process.
it
does
not
encompass
the
essential
components
of
the
right
to
counsel,
notions
of
trustworthiness,
notions
of
reliability.
in
the
fourth
amendment
the
harm
is
complete
at
the
time
that
it's
done.
it
simply
is
an
inappropriate
analogy
to
a
core
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
because
miranda
as
a
prophylactic
rule
is
just
that,
judicially
crafted
as
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
designed
as
an
outer
layer
of
protection
not
involving
a
direct
violation
of
the
constitutional
amendment
itself.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
because--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--of
course,
here
it
was
not
quite
contrary.
they're
very--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--my
argument
would
cover--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--that
as
well
because
in
essence
what
i
think
the
state
is
asking
the
court
to
do
is
to
look
through
the
wrong
end
of
the
telescope,
to
focus
solely
on
the
truth-seeking
function
to
the
exclusion
of
the
larger
context.
and
the
larger
context
is
that
this
was
an
interrogation
in
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
there
should
be
no
balancing
at
all,
and
that
is
our
position.
that
this
is
in
the
larger
context...
it's
as
much
an
adversarial
proceeding
in
private
as
the
trial
may
be.
it
may
be
as
critical
or
more
critical
than
the
trial.
the
need
for
the
presence
of
counsel
is
just
as
critical.
the
state
argues
that,
well,
the
rule
of
counsel
in
essence...
it's...
it's
limited
to
the
trial
courtroom,
it
really
doesn't
come
into
play.
but,
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
a
well-known
congressional
investigation,
the
lawyer
is
not
a
potted
plant.
the
lawyer
plays
a
role
at
that
kind
of
interrogation.
the
lawyer's
role
is
to
ensure
that
the
questions
are
fairly
stated.
more
importantly,
the
lawyer's
role
is
to
ensure
that
the
client
comprehends
the
questions.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
assuming
michigan
v.
jackson
is
prophylactic,
it's
respondent's
position
that
here
there
was
not
only
a
violation
of
the
prophylactic
rules
conceded
by
the
state
but
also
a
substantive
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
itself.
and
because
there
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment,
we
don't
get
into
that
balancing.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
that's
correct.
they
say
that
also
people
v.
gonyea,
but
that
is
not
a
case
that
rests
on
state
grounds.
that
was
a
plurality
opinion,
three
justices
basing
their
opinion
on
the
state
constitution,
three
justices
dissenting,
saying
that
use
of
the
state
grounds
was
a
pretext
to
evade
review
here,
and
the
seventh
saying
the
sixth
amendment.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
well,
that
is
the
troubling
contradiction
that
i
fumbled
badly
previously.
and
the
contradiction
is,
i
believe,
the
defendant
who
asserts
the
right
implicitly,
explicitly
evidences
his
knowing
decision
that
he
is
incapable
to
deal
with
the
state.
after
making
that
decision,
which
no
one
can
contest
as
knowing
and
intelligent,
it's
troubling
then
to
have
the
same
defendant,
if
you
will,
who
has
already
recognized
that
he
is
incapable
of
dealing
with
the
state,
go
to
the
state,
deal
with
the
state,
or,
in
this
instance,
subject
himself
to
the
guiding
hand
of
police
officers.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
i...
i
think
the
lawyer
plays
a
role
and
ultimately
the
police
don't
decide
waiver.
the
court
decides
waiver.
and
that's
our
position
here...
is,
after
assertion
of
the
right
to
counsel
there
must
be
an
exacting
standard
if
we're
going
to
get
into
the
question
of
waiver...
comparable.
in
faretta
the
court
not
only
ascertained
from
the
defendant
that
he
knew
what
he
was
doing,
that
he
wanted
to
do
that.
the
court
not
only
ascertained
and
informed
the
defendant
that
there
were
detriments.
the
court
in
faretta
actually...
the
trial
judge
actually
went
beyond
that
and
said
this
is
a
real
bad
idea.
that's
the
kind
of
waiver
that
respondent
submits...
that's
the
kind
of
exacting
waiver
that
respondent
submits
is
the
only
permissible
waiver
of
right
to
counsel
after
the
defendant
has
asserted
the
right.
what
the
state
seeks,
frankly,
is
a
license
to
interrogate
the
defendant
here...
it
was
six
days
before
trial.
there
is
no
restriction
in
the
state's
position.
so,
if
it's
unsuccessful
six
days
before
trial,
let
them
go
five
days,
four
days,
three
days,
two
days.
let
them
go
to
the
defendant
during
the
trial
itself.
there
is
absolutely
no
downside
for
the
police.
that's
why
deterrence
really
has
no--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--in
engaging
in
the
offending
interrogation,
i
would
not
attribute
the
motive
of
preventing
perjury
to
the
state,
frankly.
the
state
is
obviously
engaging
in
something
that,
number
one,
generates
impeachment
material,
number
two,
constitutes
a
form
of
discovery
that
they
were
not
otherwise
entitled
to,
number
three,
may
actually
undermine
the
integrity
of
the
process
and
inhibit
the
truth-seeking.
for
example,
if
in
this
context
the
police
had
taken
respondent
harvey's
statement
six
days
before
trial,
in
violation
of
his
right
to
counsel,
and
shared
it
with
the
complainant
and
the
complainant
then
used
it
consciously
or
unconsciously
to...
to
prepare
herself
for
testimony,
to
perhaps
consciously
or
unconsciously
to
shape
her
testimony,
to
steel
herself
for
cross-examination,
then
this
offending
interrogation
has
actually
undermined
respondent's
right
of
confrontation.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
well,
in
this
record
it
does
not
appear
to
be
perjury.
it
barely
appears
to
be
inconsistent.
but
respondent's
position
in
essence
is
that
just
as
we
do
not
permit
a
compelled
involuntary
statement,
as
in
portash,
to
be
used
for
impeachment,
we
should
not
permit,
in
the
name
of
truth-seeking,
a
statement
taken
in
clear
violation
of
the
right
to
counsel.
that
we
do
not
simply
engage
in
that
kind
of
balancing,
truth-seeking
versus
deterrence.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
i...
i
don't
know
if
it
was
ever
suggested,
frankly,
in
portash,
who
was
compelled
by
virtue
of
an
order
to
testify
before
a
grand
jury
under
oath.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
they
are
obviously
distinguishable.
but
both...
both
come
within
the
rule
that
use...
the
government
or
the
state
cannot
use
that
product
to
impeach
the
defendant
because
it
would
violate
the
fifth
amendment
right
itself.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
i
don't
know
if
it
would
lead
to
a
presumption
of
unreliability,
but
the
record
in
this
case
implicates
or
raises
a
concern
for
unreliability.
for
example,
the
three
areas
of
impeachment.
one
of
the
areas
was,
you
didn't
tell
the
police
the
name
of
this
person
whose
name
in
essence
is
now
uttered
in
your
testimony.
"yes,
i
did
tell
them.
"
respondent
testifies.
"yes,
i
told
them".
not
an
answer
that
is
patently
perjurious.
not
an
answer
that
is
even
contradicted
in
any
fashion
because
the
prosecutor
never
completes
the
impeachment
process.
the
prosecutor,
instead,
in
this
truth-seeking
venture...
adventure,
as
the
state
uses
the
term...
insinuates,
well,
if
it's
not
in
there,
that's
the
police
that
must
have
left
it
out.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
they
did
treat
it
as
an
impeachment.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
but
my
point
is,
the
presence
of
counsel
at
that
interrogation
might
have
ensured
that
when
respondent
told
the
officer
the
name,
it
got
into
the
statement.
and
that
involves,
i
think,
the
area
of
reliability,
certainly.
there
really
is
no
downside
for
the
state...
or,
in
this
instance,
the
police...
and
the
state
concedes,
certainly,
that
the
police
in
this
instance
are
acting
as
agents
of
the
prosecutor.
there
is
no
downside
whatsoever
to
keep...
to
keep
coming
back
at
the
defendant.
and,
of
course,
those
defendants
that
are
already
in
the
custody
of
the
state...
the
state
that
confines
them,
that
fees
them,
and
so
forth...
are
probably
the
most
vulnerable.
and
under
the
rule
that
the
state
seeks
here,
they
seek
a
license
to
engage
in
that
process
not
only
repeatedly,
not
only
as
often
as
they
like,
but
during
the
very
trial
process
itself.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
that's
my
position.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
and
if
the
respondent
says,--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--i
want
to
confess,
he
can
go
to
confess
in
open
court
where
there
is
an
exacting
standard
concerning
that
waiver,
an
exacting
standard
concerning
all
of
the
rights.
and
that's
in
compliance
with
rule
of--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--well,
if
that's
his
will,
his
will
will
overbear
the
lawyer
certainly.
where
is
the
harm?
why
is
it
wrong
that
the
state
says,
no,
you've

absolutely.
but
you
have
an
attorney
and
we're
going
to
provide
your
attorney
notice.
and
since
you
have
a
will
and
it's
independent,
your
will
can
overbear
that
of
the
attorney,
just
as
faretta
will
won
out
and
he
was
permitted
to
permitted
to
represent
himself.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
i
think
then
we've
implicated
the
court's
ruling
in
nicks
v.
whiteside.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
if
it
is
clear,
certainly,
that
the
client
intends
to
perjure
himself?
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
i
believe
so.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
because...
well,
on
this
record,
of
course,
we
don't
have--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--you're
assuming
the
most
difficult
case,
and
that
is
in
an
absolutely
clear,
beyond
contradiction--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--confession.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
i
believe
so.
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
absolutely.
in
fact--
mr.
robert
m.
morgan
--the
confession,
or
statement,
in
your
hypothet
certainly
may
be
no
different
than
the
involuntary
compelled
testimony
of
portash.
but
in
order
to
preserve
the
right
itself,
we
do
not
engage
in
that
kind
of
balancing.
in
order
to
prevent
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
itself,
we
don't
engage
in
that
kind

the
truth-seeking
function
versus
deterrence.
in
essence...
in
sum...
it
is
respondent's
position
that
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
his
right
to
counsel
was
violated,
that
analogies
or
comparisons
to
the
judicially
crafted
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule,
or
the
judicially
crafted
prophylactic
rules
of
miranda,
and
the
other
outer
layer
of

simply
are
inappropriate
where
there
is
a
core
violation
of
the
amendment
itself.
and
the
state

excises

to
the
sword,
which
i
think
the
court
referenced

shield--
mr.

--yes,
sir.
