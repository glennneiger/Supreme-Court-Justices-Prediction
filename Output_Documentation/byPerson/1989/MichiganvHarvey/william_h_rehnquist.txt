chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
88-512,
michigan
v.
tyris
lemont
harvey.
mr.
baughman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
relied
on
jackson
for
its
holding?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
they
ruled
that
notwithstanding
the
failure
to
object
to
its
use
in
the
trial
court,
they
would
reach
it
and
reverse
the
conviction.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--didn't
massiah
have
an
element
of
surreptitiousness
to
it
on
the
part
of
the
government?
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
there
any
doubt
here
that
the
defendant
knew
he
was
speaking
to
a
police
officer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
baughman.
mr.
morgan.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
the
police
could
not
approach
a
defendant
after
he
has
perhaps
been
assigned
counsel
and
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
make
a
statement
and
the
defendant
could
not
waive
that
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but...
but
i
thought
your
position
was
this
right
simply
could
not
be
waived
once
it
attached.
and
yet
certainly
nothing
in
michigan
v.
jackson
holds
that
a
counsel
defendant
cannot
on
himself
go
to
the
police
and
say,
look
i
want
to
tell
you
something.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i'm
not
talking
about
a
plea
proceeding.
i'm
talking...
the
guy
is
in
a
jail
cell
and
he
says
to
somebody
that
comes
by,
i
want
to
talk
to
the
police.
and
the
police
come
and
he
says,
i
know
that
i
have
a
lawyer,
i
have
a
right
to
a
lawyer,
i
have
a
right
not
to
say
anything
at
all,
i've
considered
all
that
and
i
want
to
say
something
to
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
the
contradiction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
facts
in
michigan
against
jackson
were
that
the
police
had
initiated
the
thing.
what
i'm
positing
to
you
is
totally
initiated
by
the
defendant.
your
position
is
like
what
justice
frankfurter
criticized
in
adams
against
mccann.
you
imprison
the
defendant
in
his
rights.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
he's...
then,
in
my
example,
though,
he's
free
to
go
to
the
police
or
ask
the
police...
tell
them,
i
want
to
make
a
statement.
the
police
are
free
to
receive
that
statement.
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
rehnquist
who...
what
case
do
you
rely
on
for
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
jackson
say
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
our
edwards
decision
and
our
michigan
against
jackson
decision
really
make
little
sense
because
i
thought
both
of
those
turned
on
the
idea
that
there
is
a
critical
difference
whether
it's
police-initiated
or
defendant-initiated.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
there
is
an
element
of
surreptitiousness
that
you
also
had
in
massiah.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
not
what
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
held.
they
cited
michigan
against
jackson,
as
i
recall...
and
only
michigan
against
jackson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
sounds
like
our
court.
yes.
[laughter]
mr.
morgan,
you
gave
you
a
litany
about
what
the
lawyer's
role
is.
the
lawyer's
role
is
to
do
this
and
the
lawyer's
role
is
to
do
that.
i
guess
what
this
case
involves
is
whether...
at
least
the
issue
of
whether
it's
a
core
sixth
amendment
violation...
involves
the
issue
of
whether
the
lawyer's
role
is
to
assist
the
defendant
in
deciding
whether
he
wants
a
lawyer.
and
i
don't
think
it
necessary
follows
that
just
because
the
lawyer's
role
is
to
defend
against
all
sorts
of
other
things,
it
is
also
the
lawyer's
role
to...
necessarily
the
lawyer's
role
to
assist
the
defendant
in
deciding
whether
he
wants
to
waive
his
right
to
a
lawyer.
one
can
certainly
say
that
that's
an
entirely
different
question
from
other
aspects
of
a
lawyer's
role.
chief
justice
rehnquist
part
of
the
reason
for
the
fifth
amendment
rule
in
cases
like
portash
has
been
a
feeling
on
the
part
of
the
court,
hasn't
it,
that
compelled
testimony
has
an
element
of
unreliability
to
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
you
would
distinguish
that
from
cases
where
there
is
a
suspicion
of
coercion,
of
a
physical
coercion?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
hasn't...
in
the
coerced
confession
cases
part
of
the
reasoning
there
has
been
that
the
coerced
confession
is
deemed
presumptively
unreliable?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
certainly
that
wouldn't
be
true
in
this
case.
the
circumstances
attending
the
defendant's
statement
here
would
not
lead
to
any
presumption
of
unreliability.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
treated
this
as
impeachment,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
they
didn't
say
it's
not
proper
impeachment
under
our
law.
they
say
under
the
federal
constitution
you
can't
use
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
morgan.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
baughman,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
baughman.
the
case
is
submitted.
