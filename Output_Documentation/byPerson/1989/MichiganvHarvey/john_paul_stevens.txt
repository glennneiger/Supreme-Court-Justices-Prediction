justice
stevens
mr.
baughman,
would
you
just...
i
was
trying
to
remember
this
sequence.
this
was
not
only
after
he'd
been...
this
particular
questioning
was...
was
it
after
he'd
been
both
charged
and
after
a
lawyer
had
been
appointed
to
represent--
justice
stevens
--so
the
prosecutor
and
the
police
knew
he
was
represented
and
he
had
a
lawyer
that
they
could
contact?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
the
case
would
be
any
different...
i'm
just
thinking
of
justice
kennedy's
question...
if
the
questioning
had
been
by
the
prosecutor?
justice
stevens
it
would
be
clearly
unethical,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
it's
not
unethical
for
the
prosecutor
to
use
an
agent
to
do
it?
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
do
you
think--
justice
stevens
--do
you
think
the
case
would
be
different
if
the
prosecutor
had
told
the
police
officer
to
go
ahead
and
see
what
you
can
find
out?
justice
stevens
how
about
constitutionally?
justice
stevens
but
going
back
again
to
the
constitutional
question,
you
think
it
would
not
be
a
constitutional
violation
for
the
prosecutor
himself
or
herself
to
go
ahead
and
question
the--
justice
stevens
but,
counsel,
is
it
not
possible
that
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
at
both
times?
that
(a)
it's
a
constitutional
violation
to
engage
in
this
kind
of
questioning
when
the
man
is
represented
by
counsel,
and
(b)
it's
a
constitutional
violation
to
introduce
it
at
trial.
you
seemed
to
think
the
second
was
the
case
just
very
naturally.
i
don't
think
they
are
necessarily
inconsistent
with
one
another.
justice
stevens
not
after...
after
he's
been
indicted,
do
you
think
a
police
officer
can
come
back
and
say,
i've
just
asked
him
some
questions
and
he
says
he's
innocent
so
we'll
drop
the--
justice
stevens
--it's
also
true
that
if
a
violation...
if
you
acknowledge
a
violation
occurred
at
that
time,
then
it's
quite
different
from
the
miranda
situation
in
which
the
warning
is
given
in
order
to
avoid
a
violation.
justice
stevens
well,
what
is
michigan
v.
jackson?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
stevens
to...
to
protect
to
avoid
constitutional
violation.
justice
stevens
but
here
you're
saying
a
constitutional
violation
has
occurred.
justice
stevens
i
think
you
changed
your
position
from
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
which
was
that
a
constitutional
violation
occurred
at
the
time
of
questioning.
justice
stevens
well,
what
if,
taking
justice
kennedy's
example,
the
police
had
taken
him
up
into
the
courtroom
and
set
him
on
the
witness
stand
with
nobody
there
except
the
prosecutor
and
the
police
and
said,
we'd
just
like
to
ask
you
a
few
questions,
and
he
says,
i
don't
know
whether
i
should
or
not,
and,
maybe
i
ought
to
talk
to
my
lawyer.
anyway,
they
go
ahead
and
ask
him
the
questions
and
he
goes
ahead
and
answers
them.
he
says,
i
will
do
it,
maybe
they
want
to
see
how
he
performs
on
the
stand.
would
that
itself
violate
a
constitutional
right,
do
you
think?
do
you
think
he
had
a
right
to
have
a
lawyer
with
him
in
that
proceeding?
justice
stevens
in
a
courtroom
and
the
prosecutor
himself
or
herself
present
and
they
say,
we
may
not
want
to
use
this,
but
we
just
want
to
see
how
you
respond
to
questions
in
a
courtroom.
justice
stevens
the
question
is
would
he
have
a
right
to
have
a...
could
they
do
that
without
having
a
lawyer
with
him?
justice
stevens
that's
because
the
right
to
counsel
hadn't
attached.
justice
stevens
one
is
not
a
fifth
amendment.
one
is
a
prophylactic,
according
to
you
at
least...
a
prophylactic
rule
designed
to
avoid
fifth
amendment
violations.
justice
stevens
the
other
is
a
consummated
sixth
amendment
violation.
justice
stevens
but,
mr.
baughman,
don't
you
recognize
that
there
is...
even
under
your
ethical
standards
you
referred
to
earlier
about
the
prosecutor,
if
the
right
had
not
attached,
the
prosecutor
could
go
ahead
and
interrogate
the
suspect,
wouldn't
he?
justice
stevens
there
wouldn't
be
any
ethical
violation
then,
but
apparently
under
michigan
law
there
is
a
very
sharp
distinction
between
the
relationship
that
arises
once
a
man
is
charged
and
has
a
lawyer.
different...
it's
a
different
ball
game.
justice
stevens
you
think
it
shouldn't
be,
though?
justice
stevens
well,
isn't
the
answer
to
that
that
if
everybody
plays
according
to
the
rules
and
they
show
the
statement
to
the
lawyer,
the
lawyer
will
not
put
on
the
false
testimony?
justice
stevens
so
that
if
they
carried
out
your
suggestion,
the
problem
would
be
easily
solved?
justice
stevens
instead
of
waiting
in
the
bushes
and
letting
him
put
it
in
and
get
caught
in
the
trap,
their
duty
is
to
show
it
to
the
lawyer
who
then
has
the
duty
not
to
introduce
the
false
testimony.
but
it's
paradoxical,
is
it
not,
that
the
defense
counsel
has
almost
a
higher
obligation
than
that
of
the
court?
the
court
can
blindfold
itself
to
knowingly
perjured
testimony
even
though
the
defense
attorney
cannot.
