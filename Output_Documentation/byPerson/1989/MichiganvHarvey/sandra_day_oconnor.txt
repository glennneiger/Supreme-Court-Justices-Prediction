justice
o'connor
mr.
baughman.
justice
o'connor
i
guess
you
concede
that
there
is
a
sixth
amendment
violation
here.
justice
o'connor
when
did
the
sixth
amendment
violation
occur?
justice
o'connor
is
the
admission
of
the
statements
at
trial
itself
a
sixth
amendment
violation
or
not?
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
there's
a
violation
even
though
he
didn't
use
it?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
you
had
told
me
the
violation
occurred
when
the
statements
were
taken.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
makes
a
difference
analytically
to
know
whether
it
is
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
when
the
testimony
is
offered
at
trial,
or
whether
it's
a
violation
of
some
prophylactic
rule
designed
to
protect
sixth
amendment
rights.
which
is
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
a
rather
curious
position
to
take,
i
think.
i
would
have
thought
that
the
sixth
amendment
was
violated
when
the
questions
were
asked.
then
it
becomes
a
question
of
what's
the
remedy
for
that
violation.
justice
o'connor
but
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
different,
of
course.
justice
o'connor
it
suggests
that
result.
that's
not
the
language
of
the
sixth
amendment.
justice
o'connor
well,
counsel,
if
you
take
the
position
that
the
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
occurs
at
the
time
the
evidence
is
offered
at
trial,
then
it
seems
to
me
very
difficult
to
argue
that
it's
only
a
prophylactic
rule.
then
you're
dealing
with
the
violation
itself.
if
you
took
the
position
that
the
violation
occurred
when
the
questioning
occurred,
then
i
can
understand
that
you
could
have
a
prophylactic
rule
that
says
you
won't
use
it
at
trial.
but
i
find
your
argument
hard
to
follow.
justice
o'connor
counsel,
i
thought
there
was
some
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
defendant
himself
told
the
police
officer
he'd
like
to
make
another
statement.
justice
o'connor
but
you
appear
to
concede
that
the
police
approached
him.
did
you
mean
to
do
that?
justice
o'connor
when
did
the
violation
occur?
justice
o'connor
o'connor.
justice
o'connor
can
the
defendant
waive
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel?
justice
o'connor
there
was
no
determination
here,
i
gather,
of
whether
the
defendant
waive
his
right.
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
the
court
could
have
made
that
determination?
justice
o'connor
but
if
michigan
against
jackson
is
a
prophylactic
rule,
then
presumably
we
would
get
into
a
little
balancing
to
determine
if
that's
violated...
whether
the
evidence
can
be
used
for
impeachment.
