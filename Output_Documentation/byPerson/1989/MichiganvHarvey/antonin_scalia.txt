justice
scalia
--i
don't
understand
why
you
say
that
the
case
wouldn't
be
here
because
of
the
violation
of
the
cannons.
do
we
exclude
evidence
because
of
violation
of
the
cannons
now?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
in
theory
how
would
we
have
declared
this
unlawful
if
it
was
not
a
sixth
amendment
violation?
i
mean,
it's
very
nice...
you're
drawing
a
line
between
a
sixth
amendment
violation
and
a
prophylactic
rule.
but
the
prophylactic
rule
is
enunciated
by
saying,
well,
you
know,
the
core
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
just
this,
but
in
order
to
protect
that
core
we're
going
to
say
that
a
sixth
amendment
violation
constitutes
this
greater
body
of
activity.
justice
scalia
that's
not
a
prophylactic
rule?
you
say
that
is...
that
is
core
sixth
amendment?
justice
scalia
how
do
you
get
that
from
the
text?
i
mean,
the
text
says
you're
entitled
to
counsel.
yeah.
where
does
it...
how
is
it
the
core
that
since
you're
entitled
to
counsel
you
can't
even
approach
somebody
who
has
counsel
and
say
would
you
waive
your
right
to
counsel?
how
can
you
possibly
consider
that
the
core
rather
than
prophylactic?
justice
scalia
no,
i
don't
think
it
means
that.
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
prophylactic
rule.
the
assertion
of
the
right
to
counsel
is:
i
am
entitled
to
deal
with
the
state
through
counsel.
that's
what
the
sixth
amendment
requires.
but
i'm
certainly
free
to
waive
that.
now,
as
a
prophylactic
rule
we've
said
you
can't
even
ask
for
a
waiver.
but
i
don't
see
how
the
fact
that
you
can't
even
ask
for
a
waiver
is
the
core
of
the
sixth
amendment.
you
really
think
that's
not
prophylactic?
justice
scalia
that's
the
core?
the
counsel...
defendant
can
approach
the
police
and
tell
them
i
want
to
make
a
statement.
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
he
later
recognizes
he
was
wrong.
you're
saying
he
has
just
given
away
his
free
will
somehow
and
can
no
longer
take
it
back.
he
can
only
speak
through
a
lawyer
thereafter.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
area
of
the
law
where
we
say
a
person
can
somehow
contract
away
his
right
to
contract.
that
can't
be
contracted
away.
mr.
morgan,
what
about
the
faretta
context?
do
you
think
the
lawyer
plays
a
role
in
the
judge's
decision
on
whether
to
let
the
accused
represent
himself
throughout
the
trial?
justice
scalia
but
the
only
upside
they're
asserting
is
to
prevent
the
defendant
from
perjuring
himself.
that's
the
only
upside
that
they're
asserting.
and
if
you
assume
this
is
a
prophylactic
rule,
certainly
one
of
the
things
in
the
balance
is
what's
at
the
other
end.
is
it
the
introduction
of
initial
testimony
or
is
it
rather
simply
the
state
preventing
perjury
from
occurring
by
impeaching
the
defendant
with
his
contrary
statements?
justice
scalia
we'd
have
a
different
question
before
us.
the
only
question
we
have
before
us
here
is
whether
it
can
be
used
to
counteract
what
appears
to
be
perjury
at
the
trial.
justice
scalia
of
course,
you
say
it's
a
constitutional
violation
even
if
the
police
are
not
trying
to
prompt
this...
this
statement
by
the
defendant.
it's
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
that
even
if
he's
there
at
the
cell
door
banging
with
his
cup
on
the
bars
saying,
i
want
to
confess,
i
want
to
confess,
the
police
say,
i'm
sorry,
your
lawyer's
not
here,
we
can't
reach
him,
you'll
have
to
wait
until
tomorrow.
justice
scalia
that's
your
position?
justice
scalia
yeah.
justice
scalia
his
will
by
the
sixth
amendment
has
just
maybe
been
taken
over
and
given
to
the
lawyer.
he
says,
i've
talked
to
my
minister;
i've
decided
the
decent
thing
to
do
is
to
confess.
i'm
sorry,
your
lawyer
has
your
will
now,
you
can't
do
this.
justice
scalia
