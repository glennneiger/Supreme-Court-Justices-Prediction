justice
kennedy
suppose
the
district
attorney
himself
or
herself
had
conducted
the
questioning
after
appointment
of
counsel
and
without
a
waiver.
would
that
have
been
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment?
and
let
me
tell
you
that
the
reason
i
ask
the
question
is
because
there
are
many
reasons
why
you
may
wish
to
interrogate
a
defendant
other
than
simply
to
obtain
evidence.
you
may
want
to
see
his
or
her
demeanor,
how
they
react
to
a
certain
line
of
questioning.
and
if
you
say
there
is
no
sixth
amendment
violation
unless
there
is
some
evidence
introduced,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
there
would
be
many
reasons
why
prosecutors
would
want
to
go
down
and
talk
to
the
people
they're
going
to
put
on
trial.
justice
kennedy
well,
if
we
adopt
your
rule,
what's
to
prevent
the
police
from
just
dropping
by
the
jail
cell
every
morning
and
saying,
"would
you
like
to
talk
to
us
today?
"
justice
kennedy
well,
is
that
abusive?
they
just
drop
by
every
morning
because
there
is
no
deterrent
under
your
rule,
as
i
see.
justice
kennedy
well,
they
can't...
they
don't
have
that
evidence
anyway,
by
hypothesis.
there
is
no
down-side,
in
other
words.
justice
kennedy
so
far
as
the
defendant
is
concerned,
they
are
finished
with
him
the
minute
they
have...
he
has
counsel.
but
under
your
rule,
they
might
as
well
have
the
evidence
for
impeachment.
that's
better
than
no
evidence
at
all.
a
pretty
unsanitary
prophylactic
rule
in
other
words.
justice
kennedy
counsel,
in
michigan
i
take
it
the
rule
is
that
it's
unethical
for
defense
counsel
to
knowingly
introduce
a
line
of
perjured
testimony?
justice
kennedy
but
what
would
happen
if
the
police,
after
the
appointment
of
counsel,
took
a
statement
and
gave
it
to
the
counsel
and
it
was
quite
clear
from
the
statement,
because
it
linked
up
with
other
evidence,
that
the
client's
original
story
he
told
to
the
police
was
perjured
testimony?
what
would
the
client's...
what
would
the
attorney's
obligation
be
in
that
regard?
justice
kennedy
in
other
words,
you
would...
the
defense
counsel
would
have
the
obligation
to
take
into
consideration
the
statement?
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
well,
then
why
can't
the
court
take
it
into
account?
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm...
i'm
assuming
the
more
difficult
case.
justice
kennedy
yes.
