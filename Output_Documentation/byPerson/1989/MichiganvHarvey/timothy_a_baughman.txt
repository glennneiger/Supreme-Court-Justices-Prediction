mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
an
accused
may
be
cross-examined
with
the
statement
taken
subsequent
to
the
assertion
of
his
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
as
that
right
has
been
construed
in
michigan
v.
jackson.
i
wish
to
present
for
the
court's
consideration
this
morning
two
principal
points.
the
first
is
that
exclusion
of
evidence
for
impeachment
purposes
is
an
inappropriate
remedy
for
violation
of
a
prophylactic
rule,
and
that
jackson
is
such
a
rule.
but,
secondly,
and
perhaps
more
fundamentally,
that
exclusion
of
evidence
for
impeachment
purposes
is
also
inappropriate
for
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
as
it
relates
to
custodial
interrogation.
the
facts,
very
briefly
put,
in
this
case
are
these.
the
victim
in
this
case
testified
that
respondent
raped
and
beat
her,
causing
three
fractures
to
her
left
eye
socket.
respondent,
on
the
other
hand,
testified
that
the
episode
was
essentially
an
agreement
to
exchange
sex
for
cocaine
gone
wrong,
and
that
the
blows
that
he
struck
were
in
self-defense.
the
prosecutor
questioned
respondent
about
a
statement
that
he
had
made
after
arraignment
and
assertion
of
the
right
to
counsel.
that
statement
came
to
be
taken
when
respondent
told
the
police
officer
that
he
wished
to
make
another
statement.
but
he
then
also
said
that
he
didn't
know
whether
or
not
he
should
talk
to
his
attorney.
the
officer
stated
that
that
would
not
be
necessary,
as
his
attorney
would
be
supplied
a
copy
of
any
statement
that
he
might
make.
the
assistant
prosecutor
stated
that
it
was
because
of
this
colloquy
between
respondent
and
the
attorney
that
she
did
not
believe
that
the
statement
was
admissible
in
the
case
in
chief.
however,
she
did
argue
that
it
was
admissible
for
impeachment
purposes,
arguing
that
it
was
not
involuntary.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
the
prosecutor
at
trial
conceded
that
the
colloquy
between
the
respondent
and
the
police
officer
rendered
the
statement
involuntary...
i
mean,
inadmissible
in
the
case
in
chief,
and
we
are
not
contesting
that.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
would
say
that
it
occurred
when
the
police
officer
continued
to
question
respondent
after
the
colloquy
about
whether
or
not
he
should
talk
to
his
attorney.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well...
yes.
the
sixth
amendment
was
not
violated,
i
would
say,
by
the
taking
of
the
statement.
if
the
prosecutor
had
never
used
it
for
any
purpose
there
wouldn't
be
a
violation.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
i
would
say
if...
if
nothing
was
used
at
trial,
the
issue
wouldn't
be
presented
as--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--that
is
correct.
the
officer
should
have
ceased
questioning
at
that
point.
at
least,
we
are
not
contesting
that
point.
we
did
not
raise
it
in
the
trial
court
and
we
are
not
raising
it
here,
trying
to
argue
that
that--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--well,
the
right
to
counsel
with
regard
to
custodial
interrogation,
it
seems
to
me,
can
only
ripen,
if
i
can
put
it
that
way,
when
some
evidence
taken
from
the
accused
is
offered
in
court.
if
the
prosecutor
had
not
used
this
statement
in
any
way,
then
i
would
say
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
wasn't
violated,
only
a
prophylactic
rule
to
protect
that
right
would
have
been
violated
by
the
questioning.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
either
the
sixth
amendment
or
a
prophylactic
rule
would
be
violated
when
the
questions
were
asked,
i
suspect.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
its
essence
the
sixth
amendment
is
a
trial
right
or
a
preparation
for
trial
right,
and
if
counsel
is
denied,
as
in
powell,
an
adequate
time
to
prepare,
or
denied
at
trial,
as
in
gideon,
you
have
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
itself.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
again,
i
struggle
with
the
question
because
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
sixth
amendment
was
in
essence
a
trial
right.
and,
for
example,
i
can
see
situations
in
the
fifth
amendment,
if
i
could
compare
for
just
a
moment,
where
an
individual
could
even
be
coerced
into
giving
a
statement,
but
his
fifth
amendment
right
wouldn't
be
violated
until
the
evidence
is
offered
because
his
right
is
not
to
be
compelled
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
the
sixth
amendment
to
me
does
not
suggest
on
its
face
any
necessary
role
for
counsel
at
interrogation
prior
to
the
attachment
of
the
right.
in
the
first
portion
of
my
brief
i
attempted
to
argue
or
to
make
the
point
that
there
is
at
least
some
theoretical
question
as
to
the
underpinning
of
the
entire
doctrine
of
counsel
even
having
a
role
at
this
stage.
i'm
not
planning
to
argue
that
point
today,
but
all
i
wish
to
suggest
there
is
that
there
is
an
argument
to
be
made
that
perhaps
this
court
has
taken
the
doctrine
of
the
right
to
counsel
at
impeachment
as
far
as
it
ought
to
go
so
that
it
should
not
extend
it
to
impeachment
use.
what
i
am
suggesting
here
with
the
first
portion
of
my
argument
as
to
the
prophylactic
rule
is
simply
that
jackson
is
a
prophylactic
rule
in
terms
of
guarding
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
and
that
there
hasn't
been
a
finding
in
this
case
by
any
court
that
the
respondent
didn't
otherwise
validly
waive
his
right
to
counsel.
the
issue
was
never
litigated
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes,
it
did.
on
appeal
what
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
stated
was
that
the...
and
i
quote...
that
the
statement
was
made
in
violation
of
defendant's
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel,
see,
e.g.,
michigan
v.
jackson.
a
statement
so
acquired
may
not
be
used
for
any
purpose,
including
impeachment.
and
that
was
the
extent
of
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
in
this
case.
that
court
made
no
independent
inquiry
as
to
whether
there
had
been
an
otherwise
valid
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel,
and
there
was
no
need
for
it
to
do
so
because
in
jackson
this
court
had
held
that
any
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel
occurring
after
its
assertion
and
occurring
at
police-initiated
interrogation
is
simply
invalid.
there
is
no
need
for
further
inquiry.
that
case,
michigan
v.
jackson,
was
premised
on
edwards
v.
arizona
and
imported
directly
the
edwards
rule
that
when
an
accused
asserts
his
miranda
counsel
right
to
cut
off
questioning,
any
waiver
occurring
subsequently
at
police-initiated
interrogation
is
simply
invalid
without
any
further
inquiry
into
the
manner
in
which
that
waiver
might
have
occurred.
but
i
would--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--yes.
this
was
after
arraignment
and
assertion
of
the
right
to
counsel
by
a
claim
of
indigency
and
the
appointment
of
counsel.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i'm
sure
the
police
were
undoubtedly
aware
of
that.
i
can't
say
this
individual
officer
was
that
he
said
he
wanted
to
talk
to.
but
that's...
when
he
said,
"but
i
don't
know
if
i
should
talk
to
my
lawyer.
"
that
pretty
well
told
them,
i
think.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
as
to
the
sixth
amendment
i
don't
think
it
would
make
a
difference,
but
i
think
we'd
be
into
a
different
question
in
the
state
of
michigan
as
to
the
application
of
the
ethical
standards.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes,
it
would.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
if
the
prosecutor
used
an
agent,
that
is,
told
the
police
officer
to
go
talk
to
him,
i
think
that
would
also
be
unethical.
the
cannons
say
a
lawyer
can't
communicate
or
cause
another.
but
the
prosecutor
did
not
tell
this
officer
to
talk
to
the
individual.
in
fact,
he--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--did
not
know
this
was
going
on.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
under
the
cannons
i
think
definitely
it
would
be.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
different
constitutionally.
but
i
think
we
would
not
be
here
because
of
the
cannons
and
the
way
michigan
has
construed
those.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
don't
think
the
constitutional
question
would
turn
on
who
does
the
asking.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
no.
i
think
if
the
michigan
supreme
court
or
court
of
appeals
had
said
this
case
is
reversed
because
we
find
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
a
violation
of
the
cannons
precludes
use
of
the
evidence
for
any
purpose,
then
i
think
the
case
would
have
been
decided
on
a
state
law
basis
and
we
wouldn't
have
a
federal
ground
to
go
on.
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
in
the
edwards
context
that
the
court
there
was
not
dealing
with
a
constitutional
rule.
in
solem
v.
sterns
this
court
said,
in
declining
to
afford
edwards'
retroactive
effect
that
the
court
in
edwards
had
created
a
protective
umbrella
serving
to
enhance
the
constitutional
guarantee
and
referred
to
the
rule
in
edwards
as
a
prophylactic
rule.
the
court
stated
that
edwards
established
a
bright-line
rule
to
safeguard
preexisting
rights,
not
a
new
substantive
requirement.
so,
is
it
possible
to
violate
a
protective
rule
to,
as
it
were,
pierce
the
protective
umbrella,
without
violating
the
underlying
constitutional
principle
that
the
protective
rule
or
umbrella
was
designed
to
protect?
and
i
think
this
court
has
answered
that
question
in
the
affirmative
on
more
than
one
occasion.
for
example,
in
miranda
this
court
has
held
time
and
again
that
the
miranda
warnings
themselves
are
not
constitutional
rights
but
are
prophylactic
rules
designed
to
protect
the
underlying
constitutional
right,
that
of
a
compelled
self-incrimination.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
think
your
honor
is
correct,
and
i
see
your
point.
i'm
tending
to
confuse
the
sixth
and
the
fifth
amendments.
i
think
that
if
error
occurred
in
the
constitutional
sense,
whether
it
be
a
prophylactic
rule
or
the
underlying
right,
it
would
have
to
occur
at
questioning.
the
admission
of
the
evidence
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
any
remedy
springs
or
not.
if
it's
not
admitted,
no
remedy
springs.
if
it
is,
then
there
is
a
litigable
point.
so,
i
think
your
honor
is
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
i
think,
for
example,
it's
conceivable
that
the
individual
could
be
questioned
and
then
no
prosecution
brought
or
the
case
dropped.
i
concede
that--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
but
new
evidence
might
be
uncovered,
for
example,
pointing
in
another
direction.
or
somebody
else
might
confess
and
the
charges
could
be
dropped.
charges
have
been
dropped
up
to
and
including
during
trial
in
cases.
it's
conceivable
that
it
could
happen
and
the
evidence
never
be
offered.
i
suspect
i
would
not
say,
given
justice
o'connor's
questions...
i
think
she's
correct
that
i
couldn't
say
that
means
no
violation
had
ever
occurred
when
the
questioning
occurred
previously.
it
simply
didn't
ripen
into
anything
that
one
would
litigate.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
i...
but
i'm
not
conceding
that
what
was
violated
in
this
case
was
the
constitution
of
the
questioning.
i'm
not
conceding
that
there
was
not
a
valid
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel.
i'm
conceding
that
michigan
v.
jackson
was
violated
and
the
question--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--michigan
v.
jackson
states
that
if
the
individual
has
asserted
his
right
to
counsel,
the
police
simply
may
not
initiate
any
questioning
with
him
unless
he
goes
forward
first,
which
is
the
precise
rule
of
edwards
transposed
from
the
fifth
amendment
into
the
sixth
amendment.
the
rule
of
edwards
is
that
if
the
individual
exercises
his
miranda
counsel
right,
he
can't
be
interrogated
again
unless
he
initiates.
it's
the
same
rule
from
the
fifth
into
the
sixth.
and
this
court
has
said
in
the
edwards
context
that
that's
a
prophylactic
rule
designed
to
protect
voluntaryness.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's...
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
no,
i'm
saying
a
jackson
violation
has
occurred.
what
i
am
conceding
in
this
case
is
that...
that
this
was
not
an
initiation
by
the
defendant.
and
i'm
conceding
that
simply
because
of
the
colloquy
that
occurred
between
the
police
officer
and--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--well,
let
me
try
to
make
it
clear.
the
violation
that
occurred
in
this
case
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
questioning
is
what
i'm
now
conceding
to
justice
o'connor.
but
i'm
not
conceding
that
that
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
because
that
question
has
really
never
been
litigated.
all
that
was
decided
was
that
jackson
was
violated.
and
what
i'm
arguing
to
this
court
today
in
the
first
portion
of
my
argument
is
that
jackson
establishes
a
prophylactic
rule
to
protect
waivers
of
counsel
so
that
if
an
individual
has
asserted
his
right
to
counsel,
you
just
can't
question
him
at
all.
but
i
think
that
it
is
certainly
conceivable
and
possible
that
if
the
police
do
initiate
interrogation
after
the
assertion
of
the
right
to
counsel
and
we
examined
all
the
surrounding
facts,
that
one
could
say
as
a
matter
of
actual
fact
that
a
voluntary
and
intelligent
and
knowing
waiver
of
the
right
to
counsel
has
occurred.
if
that
can
occur,
if
it
is
possible
to
actually
voluntarily,
knowingly
and
intelligently
waive
the
right
to
counsel,
when
the
police
initiate
the
interrogation,
then
the
rule
prohibiting
that
must
be
a
prophylactic
rule
designed
to
protect,
insure
and
enhance
that
guarantee,
just
as
in
the
edwards
context
it
seeks
to
protect.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
in
other
words,
if
everything
that
occurred
here
had
occurred
but
in
a
different
setting?
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
i
think
it
may
well
be
in
those
circumstances,
and
it
may
well
be--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--again,
if
he
validly
and
intelligently
and
knowingly
waived
his
right
to
counsel,
i
don't
think
the
sixth
amendment
would
be
violated
and
it
would
turn
on
the
facts
of
each
case.
initiating
the
contact
at
all
would
violate
jackson,
but
it's
possible
that
after
that
initiation
he
may
meet
a
johnson
v.
zerbst
standard,
or
any
other
standard,
for
waiver.
in
this
case,
that
was
never
litigated
because
below
the
respondent
or
defense
counsel
at
trial,
who
was
not
mr.
morgan,
did
not
object
to
the
use
of
this
statement
for
impeachment
purposes
and,
therefore,
there
was
never
any
record
developed
as
to
what
happened
in
terms
of
any
warning,
how
the
defendant
came
to
speak.
that
was
never
fully
explored
because
all
that
mattered
was...
to
the
michigan
court
of
appeals...
was
that
jackson
was
violated
because
they
treated
this
as
a
police-initiated
interrogation.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
did
three
things.
they
forgave
the
failure
to
object;
they
found
a
jackson
violation
and
said
that
a
jackson
violative
statement
cannot
be
used
for
impeachment;
and
they
held
that
this
was
not
harmless
error.
now,
i
think
as
to
one
in
three,
as
to
forgiving
the
failure
to
object
and
a
finding
of
a
lack
of
harmless
error,
that
the
court
erred
egregiously.
but
they
held
what
they
held.
and
because
they
held
in
the
way
they
held,
we
are
here
on
the
second
issue
with
a
rather
scant
record
because
the
issue
was
never
developed
in
the
trial
court
due
to
the
failure
to
object.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
if
there
is
a...
if
there
were
a
sixth
amendment
violation
in
this
case,
then
it
would
be
a
violation
of
massiah.
if--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--i
don't
think
absent
michigan
v.
jackson
what
occurred
here
would
necessarily
be
a
massiah.
the
question
would
be--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--because
the
question
would
be...
which
has
never
been
resolved...
did
the
respondent
validly
waive
his
right
to
counsel
when
the
police
initiated
the
interrogation.
until
jackson,
this
court
had
not
said
the
police
can't
initiate.
in
massiah
and
brewer
v.
williams,
there
was
initiated
interrogation
by
the
police.
but
what
divided
this
court
was
whether
there
was
an
appropriate
waiver,
not
that
the
police
had
initiated
the
contact...
that
was
not
the
concern
of
the
court
in
those
cases.
but
it
was
in
michigan
v.
jackson.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes,
there
was
a
concern
that
he
had
a
lawyer
and
there
was
a
sixth
amendment
violation
found
because
the
right
had
attached
and
the
court
held
it
wasn't
validly
waived.
it
was
the
waiver
question
that
divided
the
court
in
those
cases.
did
he
waive
it
or
not?
not
that
he
couldn't
be
approached,
but
that
he
didn't
waive
counsel
when
it
was
approached.
and
that
question,
did
he
waive
counsel--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--that's
true,
absent
waiver.
i'm...
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
waiver
question
has
never
really
been
explored
in
this
case
because
if
you
find
a
jackson
violation,
that's
the
end
of
the
analysis.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
if
you
don't
find
an
initiation.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
in
massiah,
the...
massiah
did
not
realize
that
he
was
speaking
to
a
government
agent,
colson,
who
was
in
the
car
and
wearing
a
wire,
as
i
recall.
so,--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--that's
correct.
there
was...
he
didn't
know
he
was
speaking
to
a
government
agent
so
he
couldn't
very
well
waive
his
right
to
counsel.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
oh,
no.
none
whatsoever.
as
i've
said,
the
first
part
of
my
argument
was
simply
that
this
court
should
not
find
that
exclusion
of
evidence
for
impeachment
purposes
is
required
when
a
prophylactic
rule
has
been
violated,
and
i
tried
to
urge
that
jackson
is
such
a
rule.
but,
more
fundamentally,
if
this
court
were
to
determine
that
what
happened
here
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
as
well,
we
would
also
urge
that
this
court
not
call
that
exclusion
of
the
evidence
for
impeachment
is
required.
this
court
has
considered
the
question
of
impeachment
use
of
evidence
when
it
has
been
obtained
in
violation
of
a
constitutional
principle
rather
than
a
prophylactic
rule
with
regard
to
two
amendments,
the
fourth
and
the
fifth.
and
this
court
has
reached
different
conclusions
with
regard
to
the
remedy,
depending
on
which
amendment
is
involved,
and
we
submit
for
good
reason.
with
the
fifth
amendment
this
court
has
held
that
statements
which
are
compelled
are
admissible
for
no
purpose
whatsoever.
even
those
cases
allowing
impeachment
use
of
evidence
obtained
in
violation
of
one
of
the
miranda
prophylactic
rules
recognized
if
those
statements
are
also
compelled
and
therefore
taken
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
not
simply
the
prophylactic
rule,
that
no
use
may
be
made
of
those
statements.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
not
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
necessarily.
we'd
look
at
all
the
facts.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
again,
not
necessarily.
looking
to
massiah
and
brewer,
where
this
court
was
split...
five/four
in
both
cases...
where
it
focused
on
the
facts
was
there
a
waiver.
not
that
there
couldn't
be
a
waver,
but
was
there
a
waiver.
and
i
think
as
to
whether
the
sixth
amendment
was
violated,
that's
what
this
court
would
have
to
focus
on.
and
if
in
this
case
it
was
found
that
there
is
a
sixth
amendment
violation,
again,
i
would
say
that
impeachment
use
should
be
allowed.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
i
don't
know
if
that's
exactly
what
this
court
has
done
because,
again,
if
you
look
to
the
fifth
amendment,
this
court
has
said
the
core
is
this...
compelled
self-incrimination...
and
here
are
some
rules,
prophylactic
rules,
to
protect
that
core.
and
if
these
are
violated,
you
can't
use
the
evidence
in
the
case
in
chief...
even
if
this
isn't
violated.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
true.
this
court
could
have
said
in
massiah
or
brewer,
or
other
cases,
that
the
police
approach
rendered
anything
that
was
voluntary
or
was
impermissible,
and
you
would
not
have
gotten
into
the
splits
in
the
court
in
those
cases
as
to
whether
or
not
the
waiver
had
occurred.
they
would
have
been
very
easy
cases
to
decide,
i
believe.
in
portash
this
court
held
that
the
fifth
amendment
violation
is
admissible
for
no
purpose
whatsoever
and
that
that
principle
did
not
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
statement
might
be
reliable
because
there
the
compulsion
was
a
judicial
order
rather
than
physical
force.
but
in
reversing
the
lower
court,
this
court
said
that
the
linchpin
of
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
reliability,
it's
coercion.
so,
any
coerce
statements
by
a
governmental
agent
simply
cannot
be
used
for
any
purpose
whatsoever
because,
as
justice
stewart
put
it,
in
that
case
the
court
was
dealing
with
the
constitutional
privilege
in
its
most
pristine
form.
that's
what
the
fifth
amendment
is
for.
it's
to
exclude
an
evidence
from
evidence
a
class
of
testimonial
evidence,
compelled
statements.
that's
why
it
exists.
but
with
the
fourth
amendment,
as
contrasted
to
the
fifth,
this
court
has
reached
a
different
result.
this
court
has
held
that
when
that
right
is
violated,
rather
than
a
prophylactic
rule
designed
to
protect
it...
and
i'm
unaware
of
any,
frankly...
that
use
of
evidence
for
impeachment
purposes
illegally
seized
under
the
fourth
amendment
is
permissible.
beginning
35
years
ago
in
walder,
this
court
has
consistently
held
to
that
proposition,
recognizing
that
arriving
at
the
truth
is
the
fundamental
goal
of
our
system
of
justice
and
that
full
cross-examination
is,
as
wigmore
has
said,
the
greatest
legal
engine
ever
invented.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
correct,
there
is.
the...
the--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--no,
i...
what
i'm
conceding
is...
because
we
conceded
it
in
the
trial
court...
is
that
when
the
defendant
stated,
"i
wish
to
make...
i'd
like
to
make
another
statement.
"
and
then
said,
"i
don't
know
if
i
should
talk
to
my
lawyer
or
not.
"
and
the
officer
said,
"well,
you
don't
need
to
because
we'll
give
him
the
statement.
"
that
that
should
not
be
treated
as
initiated
by
the
defendant.
that
his
remark
turned
it
into
an
initiated
interrogation
by
the
police
because
of
his
rather
ambiguous
remark
about
counsel.
the
trial
prosecutor
conceded
that's
why
she
wouldn't
use
it
in
her
case
in
chief.
and
i'm
not
disputing
here
that
this
should
not
be
treated
as
the
police...
that
it
should
be
treated
as
police-initiated
interrogation.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
well,
i
would
submit
that
certainly
abuse
of
police
conduct
shouldn't
be
allowed.
and
there
is
a--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--well,
i
think
the
deterrent
is
any...
any
evidence
so
gained
can't
be
used
in
the
case
in
chief.
it's
admitted...
it's--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--well,
there
is--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--this
court
faces
the
very
same
question
in
haas.
in
haas
what
happened
was
the
individual
was
given
his
miranda
right
to
counsel
and
asked
for
a
lawyer.
and
the
police
kept
questioning
and
a
statement
was
taken.
this
court
said
expressly,
"one
might
concede
that
when
proper
miranda
warnings
have
been
given
and
the
officer
then
continues
his
interrogation
after
the
suspect
asks
for
an
attorney.
"
which
i
submit
is
analogous
to
what
your
honor
is
suggesting,
"the
officer
may
be
said
to
have
little
to
lose
and
perhaps
something
to
gain
by
way
of
uncovering
possibly
impeachment
material.
"
"this
speculative
possibility,
however,
is
even
greater
where
the
warnings
are
defective
and
the
defect
is
not
known
to
the
officer.
"
"in
any
event,
the
balance
was
struck
in
harris
and
we
are
not
disposed
to
change
it
now.
"
i
would
submit
that
the
instant
situation
is
really
almost
perfectly
analogous
to
what
happened
in
haas.
request
for
counsel
and
interrogation
continued.
here
was--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--that's
correct.
one
is
a
fifth
amendment
and
one
is
a
sixth
amendment.
but
as
to--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
that's
true,
but
as
to
the
deterrent
effect
on
the
police
on
exclusion
of
impeachment
evidence,
i
believe
the
situations
are
analogous.
the
police
don't
want
to
get
evidence
illegally.
they're
not
out
there
trying
to
violate
all
constitutional
principles.
and
there
is
a
concern
that
they
might
get
a
statement
that
would
be
otherwise
admissible
and
now
they
can't
use
it.
they
might
evidence
which...
a
statement
which
they
derive
evidence
from
and
they
get
into
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree
analysis.
the
police
aren't
trying
to
violate
the
constitution.
there
is
a
good
deterrence
rationale
on
excluding
it
in
the
case
in
chief,
and
i
think
this
court's
remarks
in
haas
that
it's
speculative
as
to
whether
there
is
an
increased
effect
if
you
exclude
it
for
impeachment
use
is
valid
here.
haas
was
decided
15
years
ago
and
i've
seen
nothing
in
the
literature
and
nothing
has
been
suggested
in
response
to--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--yes.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
yes.
but,
again,
i--
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
--i
think
the
deterrent
principle
as
to
whether
or
not
there's
any
deterrence
gained
or
it's
significant
enough
to
warrant
the
detraction
from
the
truth-finding
process
that
happens
when
you
exclude
the
evidence
for
impeachment
purposes
is
simply
the
same
in
this
situation
as
it
is
in
haas.
again,
i
see
nothing
to
suggest
that
since
haas
police
routinely
continued
to
interrogate
people
after
they
assert
the
miranda
right
to
counsel.
and
it's
been
15
years.
i
suspect
if
one
were
to
say
that
haas
had
opened
the
floodgates
to
illegal
police
behavior,
that
we
might
have
heard
about
it
by
now.
and
i
think
that
translates
to
the
situation
also
where
we
would
see
the
same
sort
of
situation.
thank
you.
mr.
timothy
a.
baughman
just
a
quick
factual
point.
we
do
not
concede
in
this
case
that
after
the
colloquy
between
the
attorney
and
the
police
officer
improper
miranda
warnings
were
given.
what
we
concede
is...
because
we
conceded
there...
that
that
cannot
be
viewed
as
defendant-initiated
interrogation.
what
happened
after
in
terms
of
any
waiver
or
warnings
just
hasn't
been
litigated
in
this
case,
and
i
think
that's
the
only
question
i
think
that's
before
this
court
factually.
thank
you.
