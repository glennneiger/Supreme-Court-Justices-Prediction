mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit
held
unconstitutional
an
act
of
congress,
section
502
of
the
foreign
relations
authorization
act,
that
requires,
as
relevant
here,
the
deduction
and
payment
to
the
federal
treasury
of
one
and
a
half
percent
of
an
award
made
by
the
iran-united
states
claims
tribunal
in
favor
of
the
united
states
claimant,
and
paid
out
of
the
security
account
established
pursuant
to
the
algiers
accords
that
were
described
in
some
detail
in
this
court's
opinion
in
dames
&
moore
against
regan.
the
one
and
a
half
percent
fee
is
stated
by
the
text
of
section
502,
and
i
am
reading
from
page
two
of
the
government's
brief,
to
constitute
reimbursement
to
the
united
states
government
for
expenses
incurred
in
connection
with
the
arbitration
of
claims
of
the
united
states
claimants
against
iran
before
the
tribunal,
and
the
maintenance
of
the
security
account.
the
statutory
fee
schedule
not
only
was
designed
for
that
purpose,
as
the
legislative
history
corroborates,
but
our
experience
to
date
has
shown
that
the
receipts
from
the
fee
in
the
aggregate
not
only
do
not
exceed
the
purpose
for
which
the
fee
was
required,
but,
as
we
recount
in
some
detail
in
our
reply
brief,
page
12,
note
11,
they
cover
only
about
one
half
of
the
expenses
of
servicing
the
tribunal
and
claimants
before
the
tribunal
and
the
security
account.
and
this
is
calculated
against
only
the
expenses
of
maintaining
these
institutions
in
operation.
no
component
was
included,
as
it
well
might
have
been,
for
the
preliminary
expenses
that
were
incurred
by
the
government
in
negotiating
the
algiers
accords
themselves
and
in
the
military
deployments
that
were
undertaken
to
support
those
negotiations.
so--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
am
just...
i
think
insofar
as
they
can
be
related
to
a
benefit
that
is
conferred
upon
the
special
class
of
persons
they
could
be
included.
i
am
merely
making
the
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
costs
are...
against
which
these
fee
receipts
are
being
compared...
are
very
conservatively
calculated
in
showing
benefits
received
by
complainants
who
use
the
tribunal
and
the
security
account.
because
it
is
only
the
post
negotiation
maintenance
of
the
tribunal
and
security
account
that
is
taken
into
the
calculations.
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
the
award
was
an
inadequate
payment
of
the
claim.
indeed,
there
is
no
basis
for
such
a
claim
in
this
case,
because
the
award
merely
effectuated
the
settlement
between
the
parties
that
the
appellees
agreed
to,
and
the
award
was
paid
in
full
from
the
security
account.
there
is,
accordingly,
no
basis
in
the
facts
of
this
case
for
the
dis...
the
court
of
appeals
invocation
of
the
concern
expressed
in
justice
powell's
separate
opinion
in
partial
dissent
in
dames
against
moore,
that
perhaps
some
of
the
commercial
claims
of
particular
americans
would
be
used
as
bargaining
chips
for
foreign
relations
purposes,
for
release
of
the
hostages,
et
cetera.
since...
and
perhaps
the
security
account
would
prove
inadequate
to
pay
the
claims
in
full,
even
if
the
award
is
properly
made
by
the
tribunal.
nor,
may
i
add,
has
experience
in
general
with
the
functioning
of
the
tribunal
and
the
security
account
borne
out
the
concern
that
these
claims
might
be
sacrificed.
we
have,
on
page
21
of
our
brief,
recounted
that
more
than
$1
billion
of
payments
have
thus
far
been
made
out
of
the
security
account
to
successful
united
states
claimants,
and
that
iran
has
replenished
the
security
account
on
21
occasions
when
its
balance
fell
below
the
$500...
$500
million
minimum
that
is,
that
requires
it
under
the
accords
to
replenish
the
account.
thus
far,
it
has
been
able
to
satisfy
its
obligations
to
replenish
the
accounts--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--exactly
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
exactly
so,
mr.
justice.
the
challenge
here
is
solely
to
the
one
and
a
half
percent
fee
rather
than
to
the
award
itself,
but
it
is
a
fact
that
the
award
was
made
by
means
of
a
negotiated
settlement
to
which
sperry
agreed,
and
that
at
the
time
the
award
was
submitted
to
the
tribunal
for
its
entry
of
an
award
and
for
payment
of
the
fee,
of
the
award,
out
of
the
security
account,
sperry
knew
that
the
government
had
provided,
through
a
treasury
directive
license,
that
two
percent
of
the
award
would
be
deducted.
so
that
there
was
a
basis
in
the
settlement
negotiations
for
sperry
to
take
into
account
the
likelihood
that
a
fee
would
be
deducted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
quite
so,
but
the
point
nonetheless
is
relevant
to
the
foreseeability
of
what
the
consequences
of
the
settlement
would
be,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--since
sperry
did
not
waive
its
right
to
challenge
the
fee...
there
is,
however,
justice
kennedy,
another
respect
in
which
these
aggregate
figures
are
relevant
here,
and
that
is
that,
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
footnote
16,
thus
far
iran
has
managed
to
satisfy
its
obligations
to
replenish
the
security
account
by
means
of
payments
out
of
an
escrow
fund
that
has
been
created
for
the
interest
earned
by
the
security
account.
therefore,
iran
is
able
to
make
payments
from
the
security
account
pursuant
to
awards
entered
by
the
tribunal
without
having
to
call
upon
any
other
funds.
it
can
make
these
payments
from
funds
that
are
not
otherwise
at
its
disposal
for
any
other
purpose.
so
that
the
existence
of
the
security
account,
pursuant
to
the
awards,
undoubtedly
serves
as
an
inducement
for
iran
to
settle
and
discharge
claims
through
that
mechanism
and
through
use
of
these
funds
that
are
not
otherwise
available
to
it.
so
there
is,
in
that
sense,
a
benefit
being
conferred
in
the
negotiating
process
itself
by
the
mere
existence
of
the
accords
and
their
implementing
mechanisms.
now,
the
one
and
a
half
percent
fee,
as
i
have
recounted,
constitutes
what
is
known
in
the
law
as
a
user
fee,
since
it
is
reasonably
calculated
merely
to
defray
the
costs
of
services
being
provided
by
the
government
for
the
special
benefit
of
a
limited
class
of
persons
using
those
services.
this
court
has
on
numerous
occasions
upheld
the
validity
of
such
a
fee.
one
recent
example
was
kadrmas
against
dickinson
public
schools,
involving
a
fee
for
school
bus
transportation
services.
as
the
court
stated
in
massachusetts--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
normal
legal
means,
mr.
justice.
sperry
had
brought--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--eleven
months
after
the
president
froze
iranian
assets
in
this
country,
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
threat
by
iran
to
withdraw
all
those
assets,
sperry
did
attach
the
assets.
but
under
this
court's
holding
in
dames
and
moore,
that
was
entirely
contingent
and
subordinate
to
the
orders
of
the
president
saying
that,
while
such
attachments
would
be
allowed,
they
could
be
nullified
at
any
time,
and
the
assets
could
be
moved
out
of
the
country.
the
likelihood
is
that
by
the
time
sperry
brought
its
suit
in
the
united
states
courts,
there
would
not
have
been
any
assets
to
attach.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
assets
were
there
only
because
the
president
froze
them
in
the
first
place
because
of
the
international
crisis
that
had
arisen.
when
one
is
doing
business
with
a
foreign
country
there
are
risks
involved
beyond
the
risks
of
doing
domestic
business.
for
one
thing,
it
is
not
easy
to
sue
sovereign
powers.
they
enjoy
sovereign
immunity
and
other
defenses
that
other
defendants
would
not
enjoy.
there
is
a
limited
waiver
of
that
sovereign
immunity
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
but
there
is
still
active
state
doctrine
defenses,
difficulties
in
collecting
judgments,
if
there
are
no
assets
here
to
attach.
there
is
always
a
risk
that
a
foreign
government
will
fall,
that
our
relations
with
the
foreign
power
will
change
in
a
substantial
way
that
would
affect
commercial
relations
and
result
in
financial
disputes.
and
those
doing
business
with
foreign
governments
do
it
against
a
long
his...
background
of
experience
in
which
they
share
both
the
risk
and
the
benefit
that
they
may
have
to
rely
on
the
president's
intervention
to
resolve
financial
disputes
that
otherwise
would
not
easily
be
resolved
in
the
courts.
this
is
a
risk
that
in
some
ways
is
comparable
to
the
risk
undertaken
by
doing
business
with
a
domestic
corporation
that
may
fail,
and
then
instead
of
being
able
to
pursue
your
claim
against
that
corporation
in
the
ordinary
courts,
you
might
find
your
claim
subject
to
the
automatic
stay
in
bankruptcy,
and
to
be
submitted
only
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
and
it
is
subject
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
is
correct.
this
court--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it
is
common
for
tax
laws
to
be
made
retroactive,
as
this
court
has
upheld
many
times,
the
united
states
against
darusmont,
and
others,
where
there
is
no
specific
service
that
was
provided
to
the
taxpayer,
but
congress
wanted
to
achieve
uniform
treatment
of
the
taxpayers
under
this
court's
decisions
dealing
with
the
question
of
retroactivity
of
legislation
regulation
economic
relationships,
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
cases,
and
usery
against
turner
elkhorn.
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
rational
legislative
purpose
for
the
retroactive
application
itself.
and
here
there
clearly
was
a
rational
purpose
of
treating
all
claimants
who
benefitted
from
the
tribunal
and
the
awards
uniformly
and
having
them
all
share
the
cost,
rather
than
just
having
some
of
the
claimants
who
benefit
from
these
special
institutions
that
we
negotiated
to
protect
american
claims
pay
the
cost.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
does
not
exceed
the
cost
to
the
government
of
providing
those
services...
if
it
is
reasonable
to
do
that.
we
are
not
talking
about
a
confiscatory
fee
of
any
sort
here.
we...
sperry
received
an
award
of
$2,800,000
and
has
been
charged
a
fee
of
$42,000,
a
very
modest
fee
compared
to
attorneys'
fees
or
other
fees
that
are
often
incurred
in
securing
such
an
award,
and
a
fee
that
does
not
exceed
the
direct
expenses
to
the
government
of
maintaining
these
special
procedures
for
the
benefit
of
american
claimants,
such
as
sperry,
to
enable
them
to
recover
their
claims
against
the
government
of
iran.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
would
raise
problems
considerably
beyond
the
problems
here
since
there
was
already
a
two
percent
fee
prescribed
before
sperry
submitted
its
claim,
even
though
sperry
had
a
legal
argument
that
that
fee
would
not
be
valid,
and
the
fee
is
also
much
less
than
the
five
percent
fee
that
historically
has
been
charged
under
the
foreign
claims
settlement
act
for
the
president's
undertaking
to
settle
claims
of
american
companies
against
foreign
governments,
such
as
in
the
shanghai
power
case.
so
we
had
a
history
of
more
than
40
years
in
which
fees
in
excess
of
this
one
and
a
half
percent
were
regularly
charged
for
this
purpose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
filed
its
claim,
yes,
but
submitted
the
settlement
for
the
entry
of
the
award
after
it
went
into
effect.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not
at
that
time,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
think
that
that
would
meet
the
standards
this
court
has
applied
in
its
retroactivity
cases,
yes,
but
this
is
an
easier
case
because
sperry--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the,
the
fee
could
have
been
assessed
against
all
claimants
who
invoked
the
tribunal,
but
congress
chose
not
to
do
it
that
way.
the
fee
is
assessed
only
if
a
payment
is
made
out
of
the
security
account.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
sperry
and
iran
did
not
have
to
seek
a
payment
out
of
the
security
account
or
an
award
from
the
tribunal.
there
were
benefits
that
sperry
got
from
using
the
tribunal
and
the
security
account,
much
less
risk
that
the
award
would
not
be
paid
or
that
it
would
be
delayed
in
payment.
and,
of
course,
a
delay
in
payment
could
result
in
a
loss
of
much
more
than
one
and
a
half
percent
of
the
value
of
the
award.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
depended
entirely
on
settlement
negotiations
between
the
parties
to
the
dispute,
sperry
and
iran.
they
did
settle
one
of
their
other
claims,
as
we
recounted
in
footnote
20
on
page
31
of
our
brief,
without
seeking
an
award
from
the
tribunal.
these
claims
often
involved
counterclaims
and
the
like.
we
don't
know,
because
there
was
no
occasion
for
them
to
provide
the
government
with
the
information,
whether
iran
made
a
payment
to
sperry
in
settlement
of
that
other
claim.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no
other
option
within
its
own
control,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it
was
sperry
who
undertook
to
do
business
with
iran.
we
were
not
a
party
to
the
commercial
transaction.
and
we
provided
the
algiers
accords,
a
$1
billion
fund
that
iran
was
obligated
to
keep
in
the
security
account,
and
a
tribunal
to
make
awards
on
behalf
of
united
states
claimants.
that
was
a
considerable
service
that
we
were
providing.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
they
had.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
may
well
have
been
a
part
of
their
negotiation
strategy.
many
people
file
a
claim
and
then
settle
the
dispute
as
part
of
their
negotiating
strategy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
quite
true.
it
may
have
been
related
to
the
other
claim
that
did
go
to
judgment
before
the
tribunal.
we
don't
really
know
that,
because
they
were
not
required
to
disclose
to
the
government
what
the
terms
of
settlement
were
with
respect
to
the
claim
that
was
not
pursued
before
the
tribunal.
in
any
event,
there
was
a
voluntary
element
in
the
sense
that
sperry,
as
this
example
shows,
was
not
required
to
proceed
before
the
tribunal
in
order
to
settle
its
claims
with
iran
if
the
parties
could
find
another
mechanism
for
doing
that.
nor
did
the
appellees
in
this
case
have
either
a
property
right
or
some
other
constitutional
right
to
have
their
claim
against
iran
adjudicated
in
a
particular
tribunal,
in
a
united
states
court,
or
a
cost-free
forum.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
under
this
court's
decision
in
bradley
against
richmond
school
board,
and
related
cases
going
back
to
the
schooner
peggy,
appellate
courts
ordinarily
are
to
apply
intervening
changes
in
the
law
to
pending
cases,
even
though
those
changes
occurred
after
a
final
judgment
was
entered
in
the
trial
court,
and
even
though
the
legislature
did
not
specify
whether
the
intervening
change
in
the
law
would
be
applied
to
pending
cases.
now,
surely,
that
is
relevant
to
the
question
that
justice
stevens
posed,
for
example,
about
whether
congress
could
specify
that
a
one
and
a
half
percent
fee
for
enforcing
judgments
should
be
levied
and
should
apply
to
pending
cases.
the
bars
to
retroactive
application
on
intervening
changes
in
the
law
while
pending,
to
pending
cases,
are
simply
not
what
they
have
been
portrayed
to
be
in
this
case.
even
when
the
legislature
has
not
specified,
and
under
this
court's
decisions,
when
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
the
legislature
to
specify
uniform
treatment,
including
retroactive
application,
so
that
similarly
situated
persons
will
be
treated
the
same,
that
legislative
judgment
should
be
respected
by
the
courts.
now,
the
appellees
complain
about
the
particular
manner
in
which
the
fee
is
calculated
and
that
it
isn't
more
precisely
calibrated
to
the
extent
to
which
particular
claimants
used
the
tribunal,
the
security
account,
the
federal
reserve
bank,
et
cetera.
there
is
considerable
latitude
in
the
methodology
for
imposing
user
fees,
just
as
there
is
in
rate
regulation.
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that...
there
is
considerable
expense
involved
in
maintaining
the
security
account
and
the
services
supplied
by
the
federal
reserve
bank.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
a,
an
easy
method
to
calculate
what
bottom
line
benefit
from
the
whole
mechanism
a
particular
claimant
is
receiving
through
a
payment
being
made
through
the
security
account
and
through
the
rest
of
the
mechanism.
and,
incidentally,
government
agencies
pay
the
one,
the
same
one
and
half
percent
fee,
as
we
recount
in
footnote
11.
they
get
their
payments
from
the
security
account...
federal
government
agencies
that
have
claims...
and
pay
the
same
one
and
half
percent
fee.
so
there
is
no
differentiation
made
there.
it
is
true
that
bank
claims
are
treated
differently,
but
the
government
incurs
relatively
little
expense.
this
was
a
reasonable
and
easily
administered
method
of
calculating
how
to
apply
the
user
fees
without
deterring
claimants
who
might
not
succeed
and
use
the
entire
mechanism.
of
course,
other
methods
would
have
been
permissible.
in
new
york
city,
there
is
a
flat
charge
for
using
the
subway
and
you
can
ride
as
far
as
you
please.
in
the
d.c.
metro
system,
there
is
a
fare
card
system
that
calibrates
the
cost
according
to
the
length
of
your
ride.
neither
one
is
an
unconstitutional
taking
of
property
or
an
invalid
user
fee,
any
more
than
a
museum
is
obliged
to
charge
a
different
admission
fee
for
someone
who
is
going
to
leave
in
an
hour.
