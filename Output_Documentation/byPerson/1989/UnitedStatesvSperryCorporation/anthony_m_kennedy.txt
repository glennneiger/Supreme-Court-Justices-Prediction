justice
kennedy
--well,
that's
not
really
this
case,
is
it?
sperry
would
say,
i
suppose,
that
we
settled
for
a
figure
that
was
satisfactory
to
us
but
then
the
government
added
on
the
additional
deduct,
and
that
is
what
we
are
here
to
discuss.
justice
kennedy
and
i
would...
i
don't
think
they
concede
that
the
settlement
was
adequate
if
you
take
into
account
the
deduct.
i
see
nothing
to
that
effect
in
the
pleading.
justice
kennedy
well,
of
course,
i
suppose
sperry
could
foresee
that
that
fee
would
be
declared
unconstitutional,
or
unauthorized
rather,
by
the
united
states
claims
court,
so
that
still
brings
us
back
to
square
one,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
kennedy
you
are
saying
that
this
is
a
user
fee
that
has
a
nexus
to
the
transaction
that
sperry
entered
into,
and
therefore
it
is
essentially
reasonable.
is
that
the
proposition?
justice
kennedy
what
about
the
retroactivity
aspect
of
it?
i
assume
that
user
fees
are
generally
related
to
the
service
provided.
can
they
be
retroactive?
can
the
district
of
columbia
say
we
are
in
bad
financial
straits
and
we
are
charging
a
user
fee
of
$100
every
time
the
fire
truck
comes
out?
i
assume
they
could
do
that.
could
they
make
it
retroactive,
and
say
everyone
who
has
had
a
fire
truck
in
the
last
five
years
now
has
to
pay
us
$100?
justice
kennedy
so
you
would
say
that
anyone
who
uses
services
of
the
government
is
under
the
contingent
liability
that
they
may
be
charged
a
retroactive
user
fee?
