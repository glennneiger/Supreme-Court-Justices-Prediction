chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
88-952,
united
states
versus
sperry
corporation.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
rehnquist
at
what
point,
mr.
wallace,
do
you
get
to
the
point
where
it
really
wouldn't
be
permissible
to
attribute
these
costs
to--
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
could
say
that,
though,
about
a
25
percent
fee,
that
didn't
purport
to
be
equal
to
the
cost.
it
was
many
times
the
cost.
you
could
say
that
sperry
knew
about
that
when
it
made
the
settlement,
so
perhaps
it
should
have
gotten
25
percent
more
than
it
thought
it
should
have.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
congress
decided
that
the
filing
fees
in
the
district
court
have
been
low
for
a
lot
of
years.
they
haven't
nearly
covered
expenses.
so
we
are
going
to
now
charge
$200
to
file
a
complaint
in
the
district
court
and
we
are
going
to
go
back
10
years,
and
anyone
who
filed
a
complaint
in
the
district
court
in
the
last
10
years
will
be
assessed
the
difference
between
what
the
filing
fee
he
paid
was
and
$200.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
seiver,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
might
not
this
come
out
of
the
curtiss
wright
doctrine
where
they
say
in
foreign
affairs,
there
is
a
much
looser
legislative
delegation
doctrine,
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
fact
that
the
deduction
occurs
in
new
york
surely
can't
be
a
complete
answer
if
a
good
deal
of
the
rest
of
the
transaction
relates
to
foreign
affairs.
wouldn't
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
did
the
tribunal
set?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
the
hague.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
it
your
view
that
the
government
here
is
bound
by
the
claims
court
opinion
that
there
was
no
authority
in
the
various
acts
the
government
relied
on
for
the
assessment
of
this
fee,
prior
to
the
congressional
adoption
of
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
mean
bound
in
the
sense
of
res
judicata.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
don't...
thinking
it
over
though,
this
is
the
same
case,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
there
wouldn't
be
any
collateral
estoppel.
collateral
estoppel
just
applies
to
a
final
judgment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
government
says
the
fees
were
less
than
compensatory
for
its
expenses,
which
would
surely
put
a
limit
on
the
percentage.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
may
not
be
an
answer
to
some
other
points
in
your
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
it
is
an
answer
that
this
is
no
different
than
an
80
percent
charge,
or
a
50
percent
charge.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
much
chance
for
success
would
you
have
had
in
your
litigation
in
the
district
court
if
the
president
hadn't
frozen
the
assets?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
all
know
that
there
are
judgments
and
there
are
judgments,
though.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
those
are
two
different
kinds
of
costs,
the
costs
that
are
assessed
now
against
losers
in
favor
of
winners
are
the
out
of
pocket
costs
of
the
party.
what
i
think
justice
scalia's
question
is,
these
are
the
costs
of
operating
the
court
system.
and
you
could
say
that
the
party
assessment
of
costs
could
remain
and
still
the
assessment
of
the
government's
costs
could
be
different,
i
would
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
seiver.
mr.
wallace,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
the
case
is
submitted.
