justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
is
it
not
true
that
in
this
case
sperry
filed
its
claim
before
the
treasury
two
percent
regulation
was
put
into
effect?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
they
settled
it
after
it,
but
when
they
invoked
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribunal,
there
was
no
notice
that
any
claim
would
be
filed,
any
two
percent
or
one
and
half
percent
would
be
collected.
justice
stevens
under
your
rationale,
would
it
be
permissible
for
the
united
states,
after
the
whole
claims
process
is
completed,
then
to
say
we
think
the
claimants
should
pay
the
expenses,
and
then
assess
it
at
that
time,
rather
than
after
claims
are
filed
but
before
judgments
or
awards
are
issued.
and
then
just
figure
out
what
the
cost
was
and
then
send
everybody
a
bill
for
their
pro
rata
share.
justice
stevens
would
you
say
the
same
thing
if
the
assessment
also
included
the
use
of
the
claims
tribunal
by
unsuccessful
claimants?
they
also
invoked
it,
had
the
benefit
of
having
their
disputes
resolved
by
the
tribunal,
but
they
just
didn't
happen
to
recover
anything.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
even
with
regard
to
the
settlement
that
did
not
come
from
the
payment
from
the
tribunal,
they
had
first
filed
a
claim
with
the
tribunal,
had
they
not?
justice
stevens
so
that
they
really,
apparently
at
that
time,
didn't
have
any
alternative
but...
for
seeking
relief,
except
through
the
tribunal.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
this
point,
mr.
seiver.
supposing,
in
ordinary
litigation
in
the
united
states,
congress
decided
that
it
was
too
expensive
to,
unnecessarily...
we
were
spending
too
much
money
collecting
judgments,
and
they
decided
that
they
would
impose
a
one
and
a
half
percent
fee
for
the
services
of
the
marshall
or
whatever
federal
official
had
to
go
out
and
levy
on
bank
accounts
or
property
and
all
the
rest.
could
they
constitutionally
apply
such
a...
and
then
they
passed
a
statute
based
on
a
rough
calculation
authorizing
that...
could
they
apply
that
statute
to
cases
that
are
pending?
justice
stevens
you
think
not.
justice
stevens
may
i
make
sure
about
one
point,
mr.
seiver.
would
your
position
be
the
same
if
the
original
drafts
of
the
accords
spelled
this
out
and
they
had
a
plan
from
the
outset
to
impose
this
kind
of
"user
fee"
on
the
victorious
claimants?
justice
stevens
in
the
practical
matter,
you
make
a
very
forceful
argument,
that
your
choices
were
quite
limited.
and
i
am
not
sure
if
you
really
were
put
in
a
position
where
you
really
had
no
remedy
except
to
go
to
the
tribunal.
if
that
is
true,
presumably
you
would
have
done
everything
else
exactly
the
same,
even
if
you
had
known
that
one
and
a
half
percent
was
going
to
be
deducted.
justice
stevens
i
see.
and
the
only
reason
you
didn't
get
another
100,
one
and
a
half
percent
from
iran,
was
that
you
didn't
know
that
you
would
need
another
$42,000.
you
could
have
gotten
that,
but
you
said
heck--
