mr.
john
d.
seiver
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
appeal,
the
court
is
presented
with
four
distinct
constitutional
challenges
to
an
act
of
congress
which
attempts
to
retroactively
authorize
the
imposition
of
these
deductions
from
the
awards
of
the
iran
claims,
iran-us.
claims
tribunal.
these
deductions
work
as
the
taking
of
property
without
just
compensation,
a
denial
of
equal
protection
of
the
laws,
a
denial
of
due
process,
and
also
run
afoul
of
the
origination
clause
of
the
constitution.
at
the
time
litigants
were
forced
to
abandon
their
district
court
litigation
and
pursue
their
claims
against
iran
at
the
tribunal,
there
was
no
legislative
authority
or
policy
in
existence
at
the
time
which
would
have
supported
any
user
fee
or
any
deductions
from
awards
of
the
claimants
at
the
tribunal.
the
algiers
accords,
which
established
the
tribunal
and
forced
us
to
proceed
with
our
claims
there,
providing
it
as
the
only
forum
for
adjudication,
expressly
provided
that
the
governments
would
bear
the
costs
of
operating
the
tribunal.
there
was
no
discussion
of
a
user
fee
being
charged
or
any
deductions
from
awards.
similarly,
the
tribunal
modified
its
rules
of
procedure.
at
the
time
we
filed
our
claim,
uncitral
rule
38
was
modified
to
provide
that
the
costs
of
running
the
tribunal
would
be
paid
for
by
the
contracting
parties,
that
is
the
governments,
not
the
arbitrating
parties,
and
such
costs
could
not
be
an
item
of
an
award
between
the
arbitrating
parties.
finally,
in
may
of
'81,
when
the
senate
had
before
it
authorizations
for
funding
the
tribunal
and
paying
the
state
department
for
paying
the
expenses
of
running
the
tribunal,
the
senate
said
this
tribunal
is
very
important
to
u.s.
interests.
we
want
the
state
department
to
devote
sufficient
personnel
and
resources
to
the
operation
of
the
tribunal
to
protect
u.s.
citizens
interests
abroad.
please
keep
us
informed
of
the
need
for
any
additional
resources
or
any
additional
personnel;
nothing
about
charging
a
fee
for
the
use
of
it,
nothing
about
making
a
deduction
from
award
to
fund
this
particular
expense.
when
the
treasury
went
ahead
and
assessed
its...
and
issued
its
directive
license
in
june
of
'82,
that
was
some
six
months
after
the
filing
deadline
for
claims
of
the
tribunal.
it
did
so
without
any
prior
notice
and
without
any
authority.
it
did
allege
it
had
the
independent
offices
appropriations
act
when
it
issued
that
license
for
a
two
percent
deduction.
but
that
just
didn't
apply.
we
challenged
that
in
the
claims
court,
and
then
chief
judge
alex
kozinski
agreed.
the
independent
offices
appropriations
act
could
not
be
used
to
justify
a
user
fee.
so
we
have
no
express
authority
for
charging
user
fees,
we
have
no
latent,
perhaps
inherent
authority
in
the
government
to
charge
us
a
fee
for
any
particular
purpose
for
the
use
of
the
tribunal.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
well,
we're
not
really
in
foreign
affairs
anymore.
what
we
have
here
is
a
crisis
that
was
settled,
the
accords
had
been
written,
the
tribunal
had
been
up
and
running
and
issuing
awards,
and
now
the
deduction
that
we
are
challenging
occurs
in
new
york,
when
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
new
york
happens
to
get
the
award
before
it
is
passed
on
to
the
claimant.
so
the
foreign
relations
power
is
not
really
implicated.
and
the
government
didn't
even
really
rely
on
that.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
well,
yes,
i
agree
that
is
not
a
complete
answer,
but
it
demonstrates
that
really
what
is
going
on
here
is
something
that
is
removed
from
foreign
relations
and
the
general
concept
of
what
the
executive
has
power
to
do
in
furthering
foreign
relations.
there
was
nothing
left
to
be
done
once
the
accords
were
implemented
and
once
the
tribunal
was
up
and
running.
because
this
occurred
in
new
york
we
can
say,
really,
there
was
no
exercise
of
any
foreign
relations
power.
there
was
no
dealing
with
a
foreign
sovereign,
there
was
no
regulation
that
was
trying
to
say
well,
this
is
the
way
the
claims
are
going
to
be
presented
or
tried
or
adjudicated.
there
was
nothing
of
that
sort.
it
was
a
pure
reaching
into
the
pocket
of
the
claimants
and
taking
their
property
interest
in
that
award.
the
government's...
that
wasn't
the
government's
money
that
was
represented
in
the
award.
the
government
hasn't
challenged
that.
they
originally
said
that
was
public
money
that
was
on
its
way
back
from
the
security
account,
but
they
abandoned
that
below.
that
was
our
award,
and
unless
they
had
some
separate
authority,
and
the
court
of
claims...
the
claims
court
did
not
think
there
was
any
inherent
power
over
foreign
relations
to
reach
in
and
invade
that
particular
property
to
pay
for
the
costs
of
a
tribunal
which
had
been
up
and
running,
and
which
they
could
not
even
justify
by
a
reasonable
calculation,
we
should
pay
for
the
use
of
the
tribunal.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
in
the
hague,
in
the
netherlands.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
when
treasury
went
about
promulgating
its
directive
license,
it
made
no
reasonable
calculation
of
what
the
costs
were
that
could
be
attributable
to
successful
claimants.
what
it
did
was
make
an
estimate,
and
in
a
two-page
document
which
is
in
the
appendix
to
our
motion
to
dismiss
or
affirm,
what
the
costs
would
be
for
one
year,
and
extrapolated
that
out
over
a
number
of
years
to
figure
out,
this
is
what
our
entire
cost
of
operating
the
tribunal
would
be,
and
then
worked
backwards
to
determine
what
percentage
fee
will
reimburse
us
for
this
entire
cost.
not
whether
certain
claimants
were
getting
more
benefits
or
less
benefits,
whether
some
services
would
be
used
more
or
less
by
others,
not
whether--
mr.
john
d.
seiver
--i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
i
think
that
that,
there
would
be
a
retroactive
problem,
but
even
as
to
cases
that
were
pending,
or
the
day
before
they
were
filed,
we
have
a
situation
where
a
revenue-related
assessment,
that
is
purportedly
to
reimburse
costs,
has
no
relationship
to
the
costs
that
are
sought
to
be
reimbursed.
the
perfect
example
of
this,
i
think,
was
brought
up.
those
that
use
the
services
of
the
tribunal
but
don't
get
an
award,
or
if
there
was
a
possibility
of
getting
an
award
from
a
separate
account,
don't
pay
a
single
cent
for
the
use
of
the
tribunal.
and
that
was
exemplified
by
the
way
the
banks
handled
their
claims.
under
the
accords,
they
could
file
and
present
their
claims
to
the
tribunal,
and
they
have
settled
their
claims
there.
their
claims,
though,
and
their
awards,
are
not
paid
out
of
the
security
account;
it
is
paid
out
of
a
separate
account
in
england,
and
no
deductions
are
assessed.
so
here
we
have
a
separate
set
of
successful
claimants
that
are
at
least...
have
benefited
as
much
as
sperry,
have
the
same
ability
to
pay,
but
are
not
charged
anything
for
their
use
of
the
tribunal
or
the
benefit,
that
is
argued
that
was
so
strong
for
us,
to
have
the
availability
of
the
tribunal's
procedures
to
adjudicate
our
claim.
when
justice
kozinski
looked
at
the
revenue-related
assessment,
he
also
made
note
that
the
government
really
did
not
have
any
other
authority.
and
if
we
look
at
what
congress
has
been
told
about
the
authority
of
the
state
department
or
the
treasury
to
assess
these
fees,
in
june
of
'85,
when
the
act
in
question
was
under
consideration,
the
state
department
told
congress,
we
can't
fashion
an
ioaa
administrative
fee
that
would
satisfy
the
cost-benefit
nexus.
it
would
really
take
into
account
what
are
the
costs
of
the
benefits
conferred
as
opposed
to
the
costs
of
the
benefits
derived
by
users
of
the
services.
in
december
of
'82,
prior
to
us...
sperry,
instigating
this
litigation,
that
was
the,
one
of
the
first
attempts
at
getting
legislation.
mr.
michael,
one
of
the
state
departmen
advisers
told
congress
well,
we
are
going
to
go
ahead
with
this
administrative
process.
we
have
been
doing
it
since
june
of
'82.
but
we
really
need
statutory
support;
we
really
need
congress
to
make
the
policy
determination.
so
here
we
have
now
knowledge
on
the
part
of
the
government,
be
it
through
one
of
its
executive
agencies,
that
it
was
assessing
fees
without
authority,
a
determination
by
the
u.s.
claims
court
that
it
had
no
authority,
and
now,
some
four
years
after
the
accords,
some
three
years
after
the
claim
period
had
been
closed
at
the
tribunal,
but
three
weeks
after
the
ruling
by
the
claims
court,
a
retroactive
assessment.
now,
the
denial
of
due
process
in
the
retroactive
area
is
looked
at
with
a
analysis
of
the
cases
of
heinszen
and
forbes.
the
government
cannot
reach
back
and
retroactively
change
substantive
policy,
and
that
is
what
it
was
doing
here
when
it
reached
back
and
provided
the
authority
for
the
assessments.
there
had
been
no
prior
existing
authority,
no
prior
existing
notice
that
any
fee
or
deduction
would
ever
be
assessed
against
the
ward,
except
for
the
illegal
administrative
assessment
in
june
of
'82.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
if
we
take
any
illegal
act
by
an
executive
agency
as
notice
that
that
could
be
retroactively
authorized
by
congress
at
some
future
time
when
it
wished,
then
we
are
subject
to
no
control
on
the
authority
of
the
executive.
they
act
pursuant
to
enumerated
powers,
as
does
congress.
if
they
can
exceed
their
authority,
and
that
we're
going
to
have
to
cross
our
fingers
and
hope
that
they
don't
get
a
retroactive
authorization
from
congress,
then
really
we're
not
living
in
a
democratic
government.
that
is
not
the
way
our
system
of
laws
have
designed...
have
been
designed.
and
the
court's
opinions
in
heinszen
and
forbes
made
that
clear,
that
a
retroactive
assessment
could
not
really
change
substantive
legislative
policy.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
well,
bound
to
the
extent
that
they
did
not
ever
pursue
another
course
of
action
except
to
go
to
congress
to
ask--
mr.
john
d.
seiver
--well,
your
honor,
it
has
been
mooted,
and
i
am
not
sure
whether
or
not
we
could
have
an
argument
for
res
judicata,
but
probably
collateral
estoppel.
at
least
to
the
extent
that
they
have
abandoned
the
administrative
assessments--
mr.
john
d.
seiver
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
well,
there
wasn't
a
final
judgment.
judge
kozinski
did
never,
never
issued
an
order
finally
adjudging
the
violation.
but
the
action
of
the
government
estop...
basically
mooted
the
controversy
in
the
middle,
and
i
think
from
the
government
statements
that
they
could
not
ever
satisfy
the
ioaa
with
a
fee.
it
appears
that
that
really
is
on
the
verge
of
being
res
judicata.
now
the
argument
that
the
government
has
also
made--
mr.
john
d.
seiver
--well,
justice
scalia,
when
a
tax
is
applied
retroactively,
we
look
at
it
basically
as
it
is
involuntary.
the
receipt
of
income
is
something
that
we
are
not
going
to
give
up
to
avoid
a
tax.
however,
if
we
are
going
to
use
a
government
mandated
service,
generally
it
is
looked
at...
you
have
to
know
what
you
are
going
to
be
getting
into
at
the
time
you
get
into
it.
and
even
in
the
tax
area,
a
voluntary
transaction,
for
instance
a
gift,
cannot
be
retroactively
changed.
i
believe
the
tax
legislation
says
that
when
it
is
a
voluntary
act,
even
a
week
or
a
month
retroactivity
would
be
unlawful.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
well,
your
honor,
you
are
absolutely
right.
we
didn't
have
a
choice.
and
the
reason
we
bring
up
the
voluntariness
aspect
is
because
the
government
has
said
this
is
a
user
fee,
and
the
user
fees
are
imposed
in
the
context
of
having
a
choice,
because
of--
mr.
john
d.
seiver
--well,
generally
that
is
the
process
of
determining
when
someone
has
gotten
a
special
benefit
that
is
not
available
to
everyone
else.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
we
had
a
choice
to
give
up
a
$2.8
million
settlement,
or
an
$18
million
claim,
however
we
looked
at
it,
but
is
that
really
a
choice?
mr.
john
d.
seiver
well,
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
involuntariness
aspect,
that
has
been
our
main
argument,
and
we
only
brought
up
the
voluntariness
to
try
and
say
this
is
not
really
a
user
fee,
it
is
a
tax.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
i
believe
if
it
is
involuntary,
then
it
is
really
a
tax,
because
you
don't
have
a
choice.
you
can't
say,
i
mean,
i
presume
your
honor
is
correct
in
saying
if
they
want
to
put
a
charge
on
the
water,
people
are
still
going
to
take
the
water.
if
they
are
going
to
say
you
are
going
to
be
charged
for
breathing
the
air,
then
presumably
you
are
not
going
to
stop
breathing,
of
course.
but
with
the
involuntariness
of
being
forced
to
go
to
the
tribunal,
then
really
it
does
become
a
tax.
but
the
government
has
said
well,
this
is
really
not
a
tax
because
we
wanted
to
go
there.
we
voluntarily
packed
up
our
bags,
left
district
court
and
went
to
the
hague.
so
we're
only
making
the
voluntariness
argument
to
dispute
their
concept
that
we
walked
into
this
and
should
have
expected
that
some
fee
would
be
charged
against
us
for
using
the
process
of
the
tribunal.
i
don't
for
the
minute
think
that
we
had
any
other
choice.
i
think
that
the
stockholders
of
sperry
would
have
been
very
upset
if
we
walked
away
from
a
claim.
and
that's,
that's
what
really
shows
the
power
of
the
government
here.
it
could
have
been
two
percent,
it
could
have
been
10
percent,
it
could
have
been
50
percent,
80
percent.
of
course,
we
would
have
gotten
something,
and
how
could
we
have
said
well,
we
really
don't
want
to
go
after
it,
walk
away
from
$1
million
or
a
half
a
million
dollars.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
well,
your
honor,
but
what
are
the
expenses
that
are
being
incurred
on
our
benefit?
there
are
expenses
for
others
that
we're
paying
for
in
that
calculus,
if
you
add
up
the
total
expenses
of
running
the
tribunal.
so,
in
a
sense,
to
say
well,
we
happened
to
be
lucky,
we
didn't
collect
enough,
really
is
irrelevant.
it
just
happens
to
be
a
post
hoc
justification
that
they
could
have
charged
us
more,
so
we
shouldn't
be
upset
that
we're
getting
charged
anything
at
all.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
well,
i
am
trying
to
analyze
it
in
the
terms
of
what
was
the
legislative
and
administrative
record
at
the
time
these
were
imposed.
i
think
that
if
we
had
a
situation
the
government
could
have
said
well,
we'll
keep
100
percent
of
it,
wait
10
years,
see
what
has
happened
with
the
tribunal,
what
the
real
expenses
are,
how
many
awards
we
have
gotten,
and
how
much
we
can
take,
and
then
distribute
it.
and
i
think
that
would
have
been
a
very
arbitrary
act
on
the
part
of
the
government,
given
the
fact
that
this
was
our
litigation
and
our
claims
which
were
suspended
and
sent
to
the
tribunal
in
order
to
obtain
the
resolution
of
the
hostage
crisis.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
well,
i
guess
we'll
never
really
know
what
we
would
have
done.
the...
we
still
would
have
had
a
judgment.
the
president
could
not
have
suspended
our
claims--
mr.
john
d.
seiver
--perhaps
we
would
have
had
a
judgment
for,
let's
say,
the
$18
million
of
our
claim,
and
we'd
go
to
europe;
we'd
try
to
find
some
iranian
assets.
perhaps
iran
would
have
been
so
upset
when
we
found
some
assets
that
we
could
execute
on,
they
would
have
said
well,
we'll
give
you
6
million.
and
we're
not
arguing
that
the
suspension
has
somehow
or
other
diminished
our
property
rights
in
those
claims.
we're
not
arguing
that
today.
what
we
are
arguing
is
that
particular
award,
which
was
a
result
of
this
process
of
settling
our
claim,
was
our
property.
and
unless
there
is
a
separate
justification,
not
that
the
government
could
have
done
something
worse,
could
have
made
it
less,
not
something
that
is
allowing
the
government
to
say
we
created
value
so
we
can
just
take
it
away
to
whatever
degree
we
might
determine
is
reasonable
at
any
point
in
time.
if
they
could
have
come
up
with
a
situation
where
costs
and
benefits
and
everything
was
analyzed,
and
it
wasn't
a
revenue-related
fee,
then
we
might
have
had
a
legitimate
user
fee.
we
never
got
our
filing
fee
back
from
the
district
court,
our
$100,
or
whatever
we
paid
down
there.
and
that
makes
it
a
lot
like
the
webb's
case.
there
a
filing
fee
or
a
user
fee
was
charged
and
then
the
state
government
sought
to
take
all
the
interest
that
was
earned
on
the
interpleader
fund.
now,
the
court
did
not
hesitate
to
strike
that
down
as
a
forced
contribution
to
governmental
revenues
of
the
state.
and
here
the
gov...
the
congress
is
doing
the
exact
same
thing.
they
have
not
provided
any
reasonable
relation
between
the
fee
that
is
charged
and
the
use
of
the
tribunal.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
well,
the
other
bank
claimants...
we
had
no
choice
to
take
anything
but
our
payments
from
the
security
account.
the
banks
had
established
the
procedure
that
they
would
always
be
paid
from
a
different
account
in
the
bank
of
england.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
yes,
it
is.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
yes.
there
is
an
additional
aspect
to
it
in
that
the
u.s.
government
is
litigating
its
own
claims
against
iran,
and
in
the
tribunal,
iran
has
official
claims
that
it
is
litigating
against
our
government.
so
those
are
additional
claims
which
are
not
satisfied
by
the
security
account,
from
my
understanding,
and
again
that
is
a
benefit
which
is
not
being
apportioned
out.
and
if
i
can
add--
mr.
john
d.
seiver
--no,
it
isn't,
your
honor.
because
if
we
look
at
the
benefit
of
the
tribunal
and
when
it
was
established
in
this
situation,
we
didn't
ask
for
it.
we
didn't
want
it.
we...
it
culminated
in
a
big
fight
in
this
court
to
prohibit
that
to
stay
in
district
court.
iran
didn't
want
us
to
stay
in
district
court.
their
demands
had
always
been:
terminate
the
litigation
in
district
courts
if
you
want
the
hostages
back.
our
claims
were
used
really
as
bargaining
chips
to
help
resolve
that
crisis.
and
in
that
situation
the
benefits
of
the
operational--
mr.
john
d.
seiver
--well,
that
contradicts
the
entire
process
of
this
country's
adjudicatory
process
where
losers
pay
costs.
we
always
have
a
situation
when
we
go
into
court--
mr.
john
d.
seiver
--i
think...
i
am
using
the
prior
existing
policy
of
showing
that
it
is
irrational.
it
has
been
determined
for
hundreds
of
years
that
this
is
the
system,
that
the
costs...
and
when
you
go
into
it--
mr.
john
d.
seiver
--well,
not
necessarily
everything
else
has
to
be
irrational,
justice
scalia,
but
if
we
look
at
it,
at
least
we
know
when
we
go
to
court
what
we're
in
for.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
well,
your
honor,
yes.
the
filing
fee,
i
presume,
is
supposed
to
be
part
of
the
cost
process,
cost
recovery
process.
and
that
filing
fee
is
one
of
the
items
that
could
be
recovered
in
a
successful
district
court
litigation.
the
filing
fee
that
is
paid
goes
into
a
special
fund
to
help
offset
the
authorizations
and
expenditures
for
the
running
of
the
district
court
system.
so
you
could
recover
the
same
kinds
of
costs
back--
mr.
john
d.
seiver
well,
in
my
mind,
yes.
but
i
don't
think
we
even
have
to
reach
that,
in
this
case.
i
think
that
is
a
question
that
we
don't
have
to
reach,
whether
or
not
they
could
have
done
it
at
the
right
time,
with
the
right
kind
of
concept,
calling
it
a
tax,
suffering
the
political
consequences,
and
dealing
with
it
on
that
aspect.
to
bring
it
into
the
situation
here,
on
the
theory
that
it
could
have
been
done
in
another
context,
really
doesn't
justify
it.
because
then
we
have
the
situation
here
where
it
has
not
been
analyzed
what
the
costs
are.
presumably
before
congress
would
implement
a
fee
such
as
that,
for
charging
for
services
of
use
of
the
courts,
there
would
be
an
extensive
analysis
of
the
use.
for
instance,
in
an
administrative
proceeding,
the
fcc
charges
a
fee
for
people
that
go
to
hearing
and
for
using
other
services
of
the
commission,
and
that
has
been
sustained
under
the
ioaa
as
the
government
trying
to
recover
the
costs
of
its
executive
agencies.
we
don't
have
a
policy
like
that
for
the
court
system.
the
adjudication
of
disputes
and
resolutions
has
always
proceeded
in
the
situation
that
everybody
pays
their
costs
going
in,
they
pay
their
filing
fee,
and
if
the
court
believes
that
the
winner
is
entitled
to
it,
they
can
award
the
costs.
at
the
tribunal,
we
did
not
have
that
opportunity.
the
costs
of
operating
the
tribunal
could
not
be
eliminated
and
be
awarded
to
the
winners,
as
they
are
in
the
court
systems
here.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
--i
think
that
is
a
very,
much
more
difficult
question,
and
one
again
which
we
don't
have
to
answer,
but
i
will
venture
one.
that
we
probably
would
have
had
a
more
difficult
time
challenging
it
due
to
the
treaty
exception
to
the
court's
jurisdiction;
if
we
wanted
to
say
that
was
a
take,
you
know,
unconstitutional,
then
they
might
have
said,
well
this
is
part
of
the
negotiation
of
the
accords.
but
at
least
then
we
would
have
known
on
our
way
into
court
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
user
fee,
and
we
could
have
either
adjusted
our
claim
or
done
something.
we'll
never
know
whether
people--
mr.
john
d.
seiver
--well,
we
might
have
added
something
to
our
claim
to
include
the
possibility
of
recovering
that
award
from
iran,
so
instead
of
taking
2.8
million
we
would
have
taken
2.8
million,
five
hundred
thousand
dollars,
or
something
that
would
have
at
least
accounted
for
that.
we
had
no
notice
of
that,
and
as
far
as--
mr.
john
d.
seiver
--well,
this
was
our
agreement.
this
was
what
we
got.
mr.
john
d.
seiver
well,
your
honor,
to...
what
went
into
the
decision
to
take
that
amount
of
money
at
that
point--
mr.
john
d.
seiver
--well,
your
honor,
we
sued
to
get
the
$<forty-two
thousand>
[=
42,000]
back,
and
had
won.
and
we
had
found
that
that
particular
administrative
assessment
was
illegal.
the
concept
that
the
government
could
have
done
something
differently
at
another
time,
and
could
have
imposed
a
user
fee
if
they
could
have
designed
one,
really
doesn't
justify
reaching
back
and
changing
it
now,
because
they
didn't
do
it
at
the
proper
time.
they
also
established
a
mechanism
that
doesn't
evenly
charge
the
claimants
who
do
successfully
use
it,
whether
it
be
to
$40,000
or
$4,000,
it
really
doesn't
matter,
because
it
was
taken
without
prior
notice
and
without
our
ability
to
do
anything
about
it.
and
we
don't
really
need
to
speculate
well,
we
could
have
gone
and
done
something
else,
we
might
have
gone
and
tried
to
get
it
paid
from
a
different
account,
it
might
have
changed
our
negotiations.
and,
really,
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
that.
in
this
situation,
where
the
government
has
allowed
banks
to
escape
paying
these,
we
really
have
an
unfair
assessment
that
is
on
a
subset
of
american
businesses,
american
claimants.
and
with
the
expectations
from
the
accords,
the
uncitral
rules,
and
the
senate
report,
that
there
was
nothing
going
to
be
charged
for
the
use
of
this,
to
reach
back
and
change
that
is
really,
really
where
our
focus
is,
the
taking
of
our
interest.
our
founding
fathers
recognized
that
even
democratic
governments
could
take
and
tax
citizens'
property
to
excess,
so
constitutional
limits
on
the
exercise
of
these
powers
were
imposed.
here
the
government
has
invented
a
new
concept
of
a
user
fee
that
is
supposed
to
be
outside
of
these
constitutional
limitations.
the
court
should
look
closely
at
how
the
fee
is
defined
and
imposed
before
it
gives
the
government
constitutional
carte
blanche.
with
due
regard
for
these
constitutional
safeguards,
the
fee
at
issue
is
violative
of
the
constitution.
thank
you.
