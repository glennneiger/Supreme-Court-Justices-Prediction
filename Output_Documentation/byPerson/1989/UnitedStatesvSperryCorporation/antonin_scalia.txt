justice
scalia
mr.
wallace,
excuse
me.
do
we
know
if
sperry
had
any
security...
or
had
any
other
means
by
which
it
could
have
effectuated
its
claim
had
the
government
not
entered
into
these
international
agreements
and
set
up
the
fund?
justice
scalia
i
mean
it
just
seems
to
me
a
little
bit
unreal
to
say,
were
i
sperry,
i
would
feel
a
little
bit
aggrieved
when
the
government
says
you
cannot
pursue
your
claims
through
normal
legal
means;
we
are
going
to
erect
a
barrier
to
that.
and
then
we
are
going
to
make
you
pay
for
the
privilege,
as
well.
i
mean,
that
is
what
is
going
on
here,
right?
justice
scalia
attaching
any
of
the
assets
of
iran
in
this
country
and
levying
upon
them.
justice
scalia
because
of
the
government's
order
that
we
approved
previously,
correct?
justice
scalia
you
say
sperry
did
not
have
to
seek
an
award
from
the
tribunal.
what
were
the
realistic
options
sperry
had?
justice
scalia
never
mind
options
that
depend
upon
iran's
agreement
to
the
options.
that
is
not
much
of
an
option.
what
other
options,
within
its
own
control,
did
sperry
have,
other
than
proceeding
to
the
tribunal?
justice
scalia
all
right.
well,
so
then,
you
know,
don't
tell
us
well,
they
undertook
this
voluntarily.
justice
scalia
or
the
settlement
may
have
been
part
of
their
litigating
strategy.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
why
is
it
that
the
government
can
apply
a
tax
retroactively,
but
not
a
fee
of
this
sort?
justice
scalia
now
how
much
voluntary...
it
seems
to
me
you
are
really
trying
to
ride
two
horses
going
in
different
directions
in
some
of
your
argument.
this
portion
of
it
asserts
voluntariness
on
your
part,
that
had
you
known
of
the
fee,
you
wouldn't
have
proceeded
this
way.
other
portions
of
your
argument
emphasize
the
fact
that
you
had
no
choice
but
to
go
to
this
tribunal.
now,
which
is
it,
did
you
have
a
choice
or
didn't
you?
justice
scalia
is
that
so?
why?
justice
scalia
i
can
impose
a
user
fee
for
water,
couldn't
i,
for
water
services
from
the
municipality,
and
i
guess
you
would
have
a
choice
to
not
have
any
water,
if
you
consider
that
a
choice.
just
as
you
had
a
choice
not
to
get
your
money.
justice
scalia
no,
it
isn't.
but
neither
is
going
without
water.
justice
scalia
are
you
saying
a
user
fee
can't
be
charged
for
items
that
are
involuntary,
is
that
it?
justice
scalia
mr.
seiver,
you
assert
two
reasons
for
that,
two
principal
reasons
for
that,
i
think.
one
is
that
the
fee
is
only
assessed
against
those
who
use
the
fund
and
not
other
victorious
claimants
who
chose
not
to
get
their
payments
out
of
the
fund.
is
that
right?
or
through
the
new
york
bank.
justice
scalia
but
some
victorious
claimants
did
not
have
to
use
that
procedure,
and
therefore
didn't
pay
any
fee.
justice
scalia
and
that
is
one
respect
in
which
you
claim
you
have
been
treated
inequitably
in
the
sense
that
what
you
pay
doesn't
have
any
relationship
to
how
you
benefit.
justice
scalia
and
the
other
respect
is
that
the
losers
get
as
much
benefit
as
the
winners.
justice
scalia
let's
just
take
one
of
those,
the
fact
that
the
fees
are
only
assessed
against
the
victorious
claimants.
you
really
think
that
is
not
an,
a
rational
assessment
of
who
gets
the
benefit?
justice
scalia
that
is
water
over
the
dam.
but
once
you
have
the
tribunal
set
up,
would
it
be
irrational
for
a
state
to
allocate
its
court
costs
on
that
basis,
that
those
who
recover
in
litigation
shall
pay
one
percent
of
their
judgment
award
for
court
costs?
justice
scalia
i
didn't
ask
that.
i
said
whether
it
would
be
an
irrational
way
of
allocating
that.
justice
scalia
anything
else
has
to
be
irrational
therefore?
justice
scalia
no,
but
wait.
we
say
we're
going
to
go
to
a
new
system,
we're
going
to
really,
really
get
all
the
expenses
for
the
court,
not
this
piddling
filing
fee.
we're
going
to
really
try
to
recover,
going
to
make,
put
courts
on
their
own
bottom,
pay
as
you
go,
enormous
fees
to
run
the
court
system.
and
we
decide
we're
going
to
take
it
out
of
the
winner's
judgment.
that's,
that
would
not
be
constitutional
in
your
mind?
justice
scalia
--you
got
as
much
money
from
iran
as
you
could
get
from
iran,
i
hope,
didn't
you?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
to
say
i
would
have
got
another
42
if
i
had
known
i
would
have
had
this
expense,
my
goodness,
i
should
think
the
shareholders
of
sperry
would
be
very
upset
to
know
you
just
left
$42,000
on
the
table.
justice
scalia
i
agree
with
that,
mr.
wallace,
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
to
make
the
winner
pay
is
very
bad,
but
i
don't
understand
why
only
those
who
use
the
particular
payment
mechanism
should
be
those
that
were
hit
with
the
fee.
why
is
that?
justice
scalia
true,
but
you
didn't
calculate
the
total
amount
of
the
fees
that
had
to
be
collected
solely
on
the
basis
of
that
account.
you
threw
a
lot
of
other
weight
into
the
total
amount
of
the
fee.
so
why
should
those,
only
those
who
use
that
particular
aspect,
be
charged?
