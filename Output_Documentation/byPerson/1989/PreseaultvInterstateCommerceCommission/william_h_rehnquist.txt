chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
this
morning
in
no.
88-1076,
j.
paul
preseault
v.
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
berger,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
will
we
find
section
101
of
the
statute?
do
you...
do
you
have
handy
a
ready
citation
to
the
appendix
or
somewhere?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
don't--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
right
after
having
set
forth
that
section
says
that
this
is
not
sufficient
to
withdraw
the
tucker
act
remedy.
the
language
now
is
saying
that
any
other
provision
of
this
act
is
a
common
provision
in
appropriation
bills
and
is
not
the
clear
withdrawal
of
the
tucker
act
remedy
that
we've
required.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then,
if
i
own
some
land
with
a
stream
flowing
through
it
and
the
corps
of
engineers
goes
on
that
land
and
builds
a
dam
and
diverts
the
water,
i
don't
have
a
tucker...
an
inverse
condemnation
action
if
it
turns
out
that
action
of
the
corps
of
engineers
was
not
authorized
by
congress?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
berger.
mr.
martin,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
tucker
act,
mr.
martin,
and
whether
it's
available,
how
do
you
deal
with
the
hooe
case
that
is
relied
on
by
mr.
berger?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
martin.
mr.
dunleavy,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
like
saying
if
my
aunt
were
a
man,
she'd
be
my
uncle.
[laughter]
the
icc
didn't
order
the
railroad
to
keep
running.
saying
the
railroad
could
have
continued
using
it
for
rail
purposes
so
you
really
haven't
lost
anything.
in
fact,
they
didn't,
but
they
might
have.
even
though
you
have
a
deed
that
says
if
we
stop
using
it
for
rail
purposes
it's
yours,
you
say,
well,
you
haven't
lost
anything
because,
yeah,
they
have
stopped
using
it
for
rail
purposes.
but
they
might
not
have.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we're
talking
as
much
about
the
relationship
between
the
railroad
and
the
people
from
whom
they
bought
the
rights
of
way,
as
we
are
between
the
railroads
and
the
government,
aren't
we?
the
railroads
did
have
to
go
out
and
condemn
this
property.
and
i
guess
some
of
them
got
fee
interest
and
i
guess
some
of
them
got
only
easement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
might
be
the
law
of
the
state
of
vermont,
in
which
case
i
suppose
there
would
be
no
taking
here.
but
certainly
we
can't
speak
for
the
law
of
50
states
on
this
subject.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
those
didn't
really
deal
with
the
takings
problem,
did
they?
those
dealt
with
the
authority
of
congress
to
regulate
the
railroads,
were
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
some
of
the
navigational
servitude
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there...
in
there
they
do
deal
with
the
question
of
taking.
they
say
that
under
some
circumstances
what
you
had
was
not
something
that
was
really
a
property
right
so
there
was
no
taking.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dunleavy.
mr.
berger,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
berger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
brennan.
