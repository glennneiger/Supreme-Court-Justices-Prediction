justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
first
of
the
cases
is
no.
88-1076,
preseault
versus
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
it
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
the
constitutionality
of
what
is
styled
a
federal
rails-to-trails
statute.
that
is
a
statute
under
which
unused
railroad
rights
of
way
are
converted
into
recreational
trails
notwithstanding
whatever
revisionary
property
interest
exist
under
state
law.
petitioners
contend
that
the
statue
violates
both
the
fifth
amendment
takings
clause
and
the
commerce
clause.
we
find
it
unnecessary
to
evaluate
the
merits
of
the
taking
claim
because
we
hold
that
even
if
the
rails-to-trails
statute
gives
rise
to
a
taking,
compensation
is
available
to
petitioners
under
the
tucker
act
and
the
requirements
of
the
fifth
amendment
are
therefore
satisfied.
we
also
hold
that
the
statute
is
a
valid
exercise
of
congressional
power
under
the
commerce
clause.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
justice
oâ€™connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
and
justice
kennedy
join.
