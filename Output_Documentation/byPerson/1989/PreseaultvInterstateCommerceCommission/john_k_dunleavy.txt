mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
on
behalf
of
my
client,
the
state
of
vermont,
and
its
fellows
respondents,
the
city
of
burlington
and
vermont
railway,
i
urge
this
court
in
the
event
it
finds
petitioner's
taking
claim
right
for
review
to
hold
that
the
petitioners
are
not
deprived
of
any
property
interest
by
section
1247(d).
in
essence,
we
submit
to
the
court
that
section
1247(d)
takes
nothing
and
changes
nothing.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
we
do,
your
honor.
it
leaves
the
petitioners
just
where
they
would
be
if
the
icc
had
ordered
the
railroad
to
keep
running.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
well,
we
think
that--
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
--we
think,
your
honor,
that
the
rail
banking
is
itself
a
legitimate
railroad
regulatory
function.
i
think
one
of
the
basic
differences
between
our
view
and
that
taken
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
they
characterize
the
transactions
by
which
these
rights
of
ways
were
assembled
as
just
a
series
of
private
transactions.
that
is
really
at
odds
with
the
history
of
how
the
railroads
were
built.
they
were
built
and
operated
in
an
atmosphere...
atmosphere
of
pervasive
government
regulation.
the
rights
of
way
were
assembled
by
public
service
corporations
that
had
the
power
of
eminent
domain,
certainly
one
of
the
most
far-reaching
powers
that
the
government
can
delegate
to
a
private
corporation.
the
railroads,
from
the
very
beginning,
it
was
understood
that
they
would
be
regulated
by
governmental
authority,
either
the
states
or,
as
has
indeed
in
more
recent
years
become
predominant,
the
federal
government.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
well,
your
honor,
i
think
this
goes
to
the
point
that,
as
was
held
by
the
vermont
supreme
court
in
the
fitzgerald
case
in
1980
and
by
this
court
in
louisville
and
nashville
v.
mottley
in
1911,
that
when
parties
enter
into
transactions
with
a
railroad
corporation
which
is
subject
to
regulation
by
congress
under
the
commerce
clause
those
parties
are
chargeable
with
knowledge
that
that
regulation
can
have
an
effect
on
the
behavior
of
the
railroad
in
the
future.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
well,
we
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
commerce
clause
has
always
been
there.
congress
may
not...
it
didn't
establish
the
interstate
commerce
commission
until
1888.
it
didn't
start
to
regulate
abandonments
until
1920.
but
when
it
did
start
to
regulate
abandonments
in
1920,
there
were
no
grandfather
clauses
for
railroads
that
were
constructed
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
then
i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
particular--
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
--i
think
that
particular
state's
policy
would
have
to
yield
to
the
supremacy
clause.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
the--
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
--the
action
of
the
federal
government,
although
it
could
not
obviously
have
been
specifically
predicted,
is
occurring
in
an
atmosphere
where
the
possibility
of
government
regulation
under
the
commerce
clause
has
always
existed.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
not
always,
your
honor.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
not
always,
your
honor.
however,
in
a
situation
where
we
are
talking
about
a
railroad
that
was
of
indisputably
interstate
character
from
its
very
inception--
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
--i
think
clearly
they
can.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
i
think,
your
honor,
probably
the
whole
series
of
cases.
first,
colorado
v.
united
states
in
1926,
which
recognized...
its
a
seminal
case
on
the
icc's
abandonment
authority.
more
recently
chicago
and
northwestern
v.
kalo
in
1981.
the
fact
that
icc--
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
--they
go
to
the
issue
of...
congressional
authority
under
the
commerce
clause.
i
think
some
of
the...
colorado
v.
u.s.
i
think
was
addressed
to--
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
--well,
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
situation
is
strongly
analogous.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
the
rationale
used
there
is
that
although
the
state
of
title
or
the
condition
of
title
may
vary
from
state
to
state,
and
in
fact
may
be
unknown,
what
is
clear
is
that
the
property
interest
of
reparian
owners
were
subject
to
a
dominant
public
servitude
from
the
beginning.
and
as
long
as
the
action
of
congress
takes
place
pursuant
to
that
servitude,
it
does
not
result
in
a
taking.
and
i
might...
this
is
not
a
rare
situation.
it's
something
that
we
encounter
in
a
daily
basis
on
vermont...
in
vermont.
one
of
our
principal
state
highways
is
u.s.
route
7
which
was...
sections
of
it
were
laid
out
in
the
1790s,
early
1800s.
obviously,
the
property
owners
involved
in
a
condemnation
in
1795
did
not
anticipate
the
presence
of
80,000
pound
motor
trucks,
power
lines,
fiber
optic
lines,
sewers,
guard
rails,
but
they
did
understand
that
their
land
was
being
appropriated
to
a
dominant
public
servitude
and
that
the
exact
use
of
that
would
vary
depending
with
changing
public
needs
and
also
with
actions
of
future
governmental
authority
in
regulating
the
use
of
that--
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
--well,
this--
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
--well,--
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
--justice
scalia--
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
--i
think
there
are
two
different
issues
there.
one
is,
of
course,
the
issue
or
vermont
law
which
was
not
reached
by
the
second
circuit.
it
is,
incidentally,
our
position
that
vermont
law
in
effect
equates
highways
with
railroads
and
permits
a
variety
of
public
uses.
but
i
think
the
point
that
is
immediately
presented
in
this
case
is
the
commerce
clause
regulation
of
railroads.
and
i
don't
think
one
needs
to--
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
--well,
i
think
the...
we
don't
argue
that
the
commerce
clause
displaces
the
fifth
amendment.
i
think
the
court's
decisions
on
that
are
clear.
however,
as
in
the
navigational
servitude
cases,
if
the
governmental
action
that
is
being
reviewed
is
occurring
pursuant
to
a
servitude
to
which
the
property
has
always
been
subject,
there
is
no
additional
taking
even
though
the
exact
use
of
it
may
not
have
been
specifically
foreseen.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
the
property
was
acquired
in
1899
under
condemnation
powers
of--
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
--the
vermont
legislature
delegated
to
the
railroad.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
but,
justice
o'connor,
the
record
in
this
case
is
illustrative.
the
statute
provided
that
it
was
for
a
public
use.
the
legislature
reserved
the
right
to
pass
amendatory
legislation
and
the
general
statutes
in
effect
at
that
time
even
provided
that
the
state
could
acquire
the
right
of
way
for
public
ownership.
so
the
idea
of
the
rigid
static
approach
just--
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
--excuse
me?
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
acquire
it
from
the
railroad.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
no,
they
would
have
to
pay
the
railroad,
but
they--
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
--yes,
it
would
require
that.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
i
think
in
conclusion
i
would
urge
the
court
to
hold
that
any
icc
action
under
section
1247(b)
is
not
materially
different
from
other
types
of
icc
action
affecting
railroad
abandonments.
the
only
thing
that
is
different
here
is
that
the
section
1247(d)
shifts
the
burden
of
rail
corridor
preservation
from
the
carriers
to
the
trail
sponsor.
congress
could
have
taken
the
heavy-handed
approach
that
said
simply,
we're
going
to
preserve
all
rail
corridors
and
we're
going
to
make
the
rail
carriers
bear
the
expense
of
that.
but
obviously
they
made
this
decision
and
this
is,
of
course,
quite
consistent
with
the
general
tenor
of
deregulation
over
the
past
few
years
that
they
would
not
do
that
and
that
in
effect
this
is
a
subsidy
that
transfers
the
expense
to
the
trail
sponsors.
it
is,
nonetheless,
a
railroad
purpose.
and
the
fact
that
the
burden--
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
--the
statute
requires
them
to
maintain
the
right
of
way
and
to
acknowledge
that
it's
subject
to
resumption
of
railroad
purposes.
i
don't
think
there
is
anything...
any
specific
regulation.
in
this
particular
instance,
the
lease
requires
them
to
maintain
it
and
the
icc
acknowledged
that
fact
in
its
decision.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
we
submit
that
the
rule
urged
by
petitioners
is
not
only
impractical
but
analytically
unsound
in
that
it
ignores
the
role
of
federal
regulation
under
the
commerce
clause
as
an
integral
part
of
the
burden
of
railroading
for
which
the
petitioners'
predecessors
in
interest
were
fully
compensated
in
1899.
thank
you.
mr.
john
k.
dunleavy
well,
contrary,
your
honor,
to
the
petitioners'
suggestion,
i
think
the
record
is
clear
that
they
had
heard
of
the
commerce
clause
in
vermont
in
the
19th
century.
thank
you.
