mr.
michael
m.
berger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
a
congressional
intent
to
preempt
state
real
property
law
throughout
the
country
and
in
so
doing
transform
private
property
into
public
recreational
hiking
and
biking
trails.
this
morning
i
would
like
to
address
key
elements
of
the
two
fundamental
issues
in
this
case.
first,
the
invalidity
of
this
statute
under
the
fifth
amendment,
examining
both
the
second
circuit's
broad
holding
that
under
no
set
of
facts
could
this
statute
ever
be
a
taking
of
property,
and
then
discussing
the
inability
of
the
claims
court
to
provide
compensation
for
any
taking
which
might
occur
because
of
the
strict
congressional
prohibition
on
the
expenditure
of
funds
which
were
not
appropriated
for
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
second,
i
would
like
to
discuss
the
invalidity
of
this
statute
as
a
commerce
clause
regulatory
measure
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
interstate
commerce
commission
cannot
approve
the
conversion
of
an
abandoned
railroad
right
of
way
to
a
recreational
hiking
or
biking
trail
until
after
it
first
determines
that
there
is
no
future
railroad
need
for
the
particular
right
of
way
in
question.
i
would
like
to
turn
first,
then,
to
the
fifth
amendment
problems
in
this
case.
first,
what
the
statute
does
is
clearly
to
override
and
change
settled
state
law.
the
reason,
in
fact,
why
this
statute
was
enacted
in
1983
as
an
amendment
to
the
national
trails
act
was
that
trail
groups
had
tried
to
transform
abandoned
railroad
rights
of
way
into
recreational
trails
before
that
and
found
themselves
confronted
by
state
courts
which
would
not
permit
it.
the
reason
that
the
state
courts
would
not
permit
it
is
that
what
the
railroads
acquired,
usually
in
the
1800s,
was
an
easement
for
railroad
right
of
way
purposes.
and
under
settled
state
law
in
virtually
every
stated
in
this
nation,
once
the
railroad
stopped
using
the
right
of
way
for
railroad
purposes,
for
running
trains,
the
easement
would
vanish
and
the
underlying
fee
title
owner
would
be
entitled
to
full
use,
enjoyment,
and
possession
of
the
property.
so
that
state
courts
were
not,
based
on
that
body
of
law,
permitting
the
transformation
of
abandoned
rights
of
way
into
some
other
use
because
the
railroad
in
a
very
classic
sense
owned
nothing
and
therefore
could
transfer
nothing.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
the
major--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--i
believe
it
does
work
into
the
calculus,
justice
o'connor.
the
way
that
it
works
in
is
that
it's
been
consistently
held
both
by
this
court
and
by
the
vermont
supreme
court
that
until
the
interstate
commerce
commission
declares
an
abandonment
of
a
railroad
right
of
way
there
is
no
room
for
the
state
law
to
come
into
effect.
state
law,
until
that
point,
is
preempted
by
the
supremacy
clause.
and
my
clients
have
no
quarrel
with
that
state
of
affairs
where
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
exercising
its
expertise
on
the
need
for
rail
transportation
and
the
need
for
particular
rights
of
way,
determines
whether
the
abandonment
of
a
right
of
way
is
appropriate
in
a
particular
case.
once
there
is
an
abandonment,
however,
this
court's
opinions
are
likewise
clear
that
state
law
then
takes
over
and
controls
and
the
icc
and
the
federal
determinations
are
out
of
the
picture
and--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--the
way
that
that
works,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
before
the
icc
considers
whether
to
approve
the
negotiations
between
a
railroad
and
either
a
state
and
local
agency
or
a
recognized
trail
organization
to
transform
this
right
of
way
into
a
recreational
right
of
way
from
a
full-blown
transportation
right
of
way,
the
icc
first
has
to
determine
that
it
is
appropriate
for
the
railroad
to
abandon
railroad
usage
of
this
right
of
way
and
that
there
is
neither
present
nor
future
public
railroad
need
for
the
right
of
way.
that's
in
section
10903,
49
usc,
and
the
statute
is
very
clear.
the
icc
is
also
very
clear
on
that.
they
said
earlier
this
year
that
in
every
trails
case
before
they
reach
the
trail
question
they
will
already
have
decided
that
the
public
use
does
not
require
continued
railroad
usage
and
permits
the
railroad
to
fully
abandon
the
railroad
usage.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
that
is
certainly
the
other
question
in
this
case,
and
i'd
be
happy
to
address
that
since
your
honor
is
interested
in
it.
the
tucker
act,
of
course...
and
i
must
confess
i
find
it
strange
standing
here
arguing
that
there
is
no
right
on
behalf
of
my
clients
to
recover
compensation
and
find
the
solicitor
general
arguing,
oh,
yes,
they
should
be
getting
money
for
this.
the...
analyzing
the
tucker
act
question
gets
us
into
the
issue
of
what
action
congress
authorized
the
federal
government
to
take.
and
it
may
get
a
little
bit
technical,
but
this
court
in
ruckelshaus
v.
monsanto,
in
the
regional
rail
reorganization
act
cases
most
recently,
concluded
that
the
tucker
act
and
a
suit
for
compensation
in
the
claims
court
is
available
for
authorized
governmental
activity
and
only
for
authorized
governmental
activity.
if
it's
not
authorized,
then
this
court
and
the
claims
court
treat
it
as
a
tort
and
that's
not
available
for
recompense
under
the
tucker
act.
so,
we
have
to
examine
the
statute
in
this
case
to
determine
what
is
it
that
congress
authorized
anybody
to
do
under
this
statute.
and
what
we
find
is
that
congress
authorized
the
conversion
of
abandoned
railroad
rights
of
way
into
recreational
hiking
and
biking
trails
if
that
could
be
done
without
the
expenditure
of
federal
money
unless
congress
had
specifically
appropriated
money
for
this
program
in
advance
of
the
acquisition.
that's
in
section
101
of
this
statute,
and
it
is
as
clear
an
expression
of
congressional
attempt
to
control
expense
as
i've
ever
seen.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
it--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--it's
on
page
18
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
what
the
statute
says,
and
i'll
be
happy
to
read
it
for
the
record
and
for
the
court,
is
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
this
act,
authority
to
enter
into
contracts
and
to
make
payments
under
this
act
shall
be
effective
only
to
such
extent
or
in
such
amounts
as
are
provided
in
advance
in
appropriations
acts.
"
what
the
intent
of
congress
was
in
doing
this
was
to
create
essentially
a
voluntary
program
that
would
result
in
no
liability
to
the
federal
government
if
voluntary
agreements
could
be
worked
out
among
the
parties
that
they
thought
were
involved
in
these
proceedings.
the
problem
is
that
the
way
that
the
statute
is
set
up,
the
way
that
the
icc
administers
it,
the
people
who
own
the
underlying
fee
interest
in
these
rights
of
way
are
not
even
consulted,
let
alone
brought
into
the
picture.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
your
honor,
i
recognize
the
solicitor
general
has
argued
that
position.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
we
need
to
do
is
to
look
at
what
this
court
has
done
with
similar
provisions
in
the
past
and
with
congressional
restrictions
on
expenditures.
the
classic
case
is
the
case
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
called
hooe
v.
united
states,
a
case
this
court
decided
sometime
in
the
'20s,
i
believe,
but
was
relied
on
this
by
court
in
the
regional
rail
reorganization
act
cases
a
decade
ago
to
describe
and
illustrate
what
this
court
meant
by
authorized
congressional
action.
what
happened
in
hooe
was
that
the
congress
had
created
the
civil
service
commission,
authorized
it
to
both
exist
and
rent
quarters.
and
then
it
appropriated
a
sum
of
money
for
it
to
rent
those
quarters.
the
commission
went
out
and
rented
quarters
but
instead
of
renting
$4,000
worth
or
space
like
congress
had
told
it
to
do,
the
commission
had
a
$6,000
appetite.
when
the
landlord
accepted
the
rent
from
the
commission,
didn't
complain
about
it,
never
sued
over
the
next
couple
of
years
to
throw
the
commission
out
of
the
space
that
wasn't
being
paid
for,
the
landlord
sued
in
the
claims
court
and
thought
that
he
had
either
an
implied
contract
from
the
government
to
pay
for
this
extra
space
which
was
being
occupied
or
he
had
a
constitutional
claim
for
a
taking
of
his
property
without
payment
of
compensation.
what
this
court
said
was,
analyzing
it
under
the
tucker
act,
when
congress
said
you
could
have
$4,000
to
rent
space,
that's
what
congress
meant.
and
congress
did
not
authorize
the
occupancy
of
any
space
beyond
what
$4,000
would
buy.
therefore,
the
occupation
of
additional
space
by
an
agency
of
the
federal
government
was
unauthorized
governmental
activity
and
at
best
was
a
tort
that
was
not
compensate...
compensable
in
the
claims
court
either
as
an
implied
contract
or
as
a
constitutional
remedy
for
a
taking
of
property
by
the
government.
this
was
not
authorized
governmental
conduct.
and,
as
i
said,
when
this
court
decided
the
regional
rail
reorganization
act
cases
a
decade
or
so
ago
and
examined
some
of
the
early
precursors
to
this
reorganization
of
the
transportation
statutes,
it
quoted
from
the
hooe
case
with
approval
on
just
what
is
authorized
governmental
action
and
what
is
not.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
your
honor,
that's
what
this
court
has
said.
candidly,
i'm
not
all
comfortable
with
some
of
those
opinions
but
i
think
that
they
are
there.
and
as
i
say,
as
recently
as
the
regional
rail
cases
this
court
quotes
that
line
of
authority...
with
approval...
saying
that
in
effect
has
carved
out
a
branch
of
actions
which
the
court
says
are
not
actions
of
the
government
but
are
actions
by
government
officials
unauthorized
by
congress,
and
the
remedy
for
those
actions
is
not
in
the
claims
court.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
construe
it
only
as
applying
to
that.
i
construe
it
as
applying
across
the
board
to
takings
as
well
as
to
all
of
the
other--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--and
other
needs
by--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--certainly
it
could
be
given
some
effect.
i
can't
quarrel
with
that.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute,
as
written,
doesn't
lend
itself
to
that
sort
of
an
interpretation.
it's
a
broadly
written
statute
which,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
clear
indication
of
what
the
slim
legislative
history
in
this
case
reflects.
and
that
is
that
what
congress
wanted
to
do
was
to
create
these
trails
if
it
could
do
so
without
spending
money.
if
it
had
to
spend
money,
i
don't
think
congress
was
interested
in
this--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--well,
justice
o'connor,
i
certainly
think
it
would
have
to
be
with
a
very
different
approach
than
the
one
that
the
second
circuit
took
because
what
the
second
circuit
said
was
that
under
no
circumstances
do
we
have
a
taking
here
which
anybody
could
remedy.
so
that
if
the
court
were
to
agree
that
there
is
a
tucker
act
remedy
available
here,
there
would
certainly
have
to
be
some
dealing
with
that
issue
and
a
clear
expression
from
the
court
that
that
in
fact
is
what
the
underlying
fee
property
owners
in
these
trail
conversions
are
supposed
to
be
doing
and--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--well,
it's
been
cited
to
the
court
but
there
certainly
has
been
no
determination--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--in
this
case.
both
the
icc
and
the
second
circuit
simply
assumed
that
mr.
and
mrs.
preseault
had
the
interest
that
they
claimed,
that
there
would
be
an
interference
with
it,
but
that
it
did
not
present
a
fifth
amendment
problem.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
no,
your
honor.
that's
an
entirely
different
situation.
what
we
would
have
there,
justice
kennedy,
is
an
application
of
the
existing
regulatory
scheme
as
it
is
intended
to
operate
and
as
the
fee
owners
underlying
these
rail
easements
understand
it
to
operate.
and
that
is
that
the
icc
determines
whether
in
a
particular
case
abandonment
of
the
right
of
way
is
appropriate.
please
recall
that
what
we
have
in
this
case,
however,
is
something
which
is
wholly
different.
if
the
icc
decided
there
would
be
no
abandonment,
then
the
tracks,
the
ties,
the
bridges,
the
trestles,
they
all
remain
in
place,
and
the
railroad
is
responsible
for
maintaining
them
if
it
wants
to
hold
on
to
that
possibility
of
reactivating
the
rail
line
in
25
years.
what
we
have
in
a
trails
act
conversion
is
that
the
abandonment
is
in
fact
approved.
what
the
icc
says
is
we
don't
need
this
property
for
railroad
use
anymore,
you
may
go
forth,
tear
up
the
tracks--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--the
statute
is
very
clear
that
the
icc
in
authorizing
abandonment
must
consider
whether
there
is
any
future
railroad
need
for
this
property,
and
if
it
finds
that
there
is,
it
must
deny
the
abandonment.
in
this
case,
of
course--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--i
suppose
they
could
do
that,
your
honor,
and
i'm
sure
in
some
cases
that
in
fact
happens.
whether
it
happens
in
cases
where
they
owned
only
a
right
of
way
for
railroad
purposes,
i
sincerely
doubt.
i
think
where
you
have
that
situation
you
would
find
it
where
the
railroad
had
bought
fee
title
to
the
right
of
way
area
and
wanted
to
clear
its
tracks
off.
when
the
icc
authorizes
abandonment,
it
authorizes
full
abandonment.
when
it
authorizes
a
discontinuance
in
service,
the
tracks,
ties,
trestles,
bridges
all
remain
in
place
for
reactivation.
what
we
have
here
in
this
situation
is
somewhat
of
a...
a
different
angle
because
the
railroad
in
question
never
asked
anybody
for
permission
to
stop
running
along
this
route.
they
simply
stopped
14
years
ago,
tore
up
the
ties
and
tracks
and
put
them
to
other
use,
and
when
mr.
and
mrs.
preseault
decided
that
they
had
had
enough
and
they
wanted
to
clear
their
title
to
the
land
and
they
went
to
the
icc
to
ask
the
icc
to
declare
a
de
facto
abandonment
here,
the
railroad
stepped
in
and
said,
oh,
yes,
by
the
way,
why
don't
you
approve
what
we
did
ten
years
ago.
the
situation
is
a
little
off
the
norm
factually,
but
all
of
those
facts
are
really
sort
of
only
in
broad
brush
in
the
record
here
because
no
court
has
ever
examined
what
the
facts
are
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--i
honestly
don't,
justice
scalia.
all
i
can
tell
you
is
that
the...
what
the
record
does
reflect
is
that
approximately
3,000
miles
of
right
of
way
are
being
abandoned
every
year
and
that
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
trail
organizations
wanted
to
get
congress
involved
in
this
and
why
there
was
such
a
nationwide
interest,
because
this
is
happening
in
many
states
around
the
country.
but
at
3,000
miles
a
year,
some
of
this
land
is
quite
valuable.
the
case
that's
before
the
court
today
involves
a
right
of
way
that
runs
essentially
along
the
lakefront
in
burlington,
vermont.
it
is
quite
expensive
land.
the--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--it
is
the
more
common,
as
i
understand
what
has
happened
in
these
cases,
your
honor.
the
railroads
in
many
cases...
in
many
states,
rather,
including
vermont,
were
essentially
forbidden
either
by
statute
or
by
case
law
from
acquiring
anything
other
than
an
easement
for
right
of
way
purposes.
and
even
where
they
weren't,
they
elected
to
acquire
the
lesser
estate
in
the
land
or
the
property
owners
at
the
time
elected
to
retain
some
interest
in
case
railroad
usage
should
cease
at
some
future
point.
that
way
they
would
be
able
to
reclaim
and
reuse
what
was
left.
but
it
is
a
substantial
problem,
if
in
fact
there
has
to
be
payment,
which
gets
us
back
into
the
skimpy
legislative
history
of
this
program
where
the
congressional
budget
office
examined
the
rails-to-trails
program
and
the
other
amendments
to
the
trails
act
in
1983
and
concluded,
with
the
concurrence
of
the
house
committee
that
examined
it,
that
the
funding
required
for
all
of
these
amendments
would
be,
in
their
words,
insignificant.
and
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
almost
any
value
you
placed
upon
3,000
miles
of
right
of
way
every
year
is
going
to
be
something
more
than
insignificant
even
in
the
context
of
determining
the
federal
budget.
what
we've
got
here
is
a
program
that
could
in
fact
result
in
substantial
judgments.
we
have
a
statute
whereby
congress
said
it
didn't
want
to
spend
money
unless
it
approved
the
expenditure
of
that
money
in
advance
in
order
to
keep
some
control
over
what
those
potential
federal
expenditures
might
be.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
the
act,
in
fact,
would
have
no
application
at
all
if
it
were
confined
to
cases
in
which
the
railroad
owns
the
fee,
justice
kennedy.
it
was
designed
to
operate
and
needed
to
operate
only
in
those
situations
where
the
railroad
owned
an
easement,
subject
to
reversion.
the
point
being,
and
the
icc's
reports
bear
this
out,
that
where
the
railroad
owns
fee
title,
the
railroad
has
always
been
free
to
transfer
its
interest
to
a
state
or
local
government
or
a
trail
organization
for
any
use
that
it
wanted
to.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
the
statute
says
it
encourages
the
icc
to
do
that.
in
practice
what
happens
is
that
the
icc
simply
holds
its
abandonment
hearings.
if
during
the
proceedings
up...
leading
up
to
abandonment
some
state
or
local
government
agency
or
a
recognized
trail
group
files
papers
with
the
icc
indicating
an
interest
in
acquiring
the
property
to
operate
a
trail
on,
then
the
icc
grants
the
railroad
and
that
organization
180
days
after
the
determination
that
an
abandonment
is
appropriate
in
order
to
see
whether
they
can
negotiate
voluntarily
any
transfer
of
use
to
a
recreational
trail.
the
icc
has
clearly
said
that
its
function
in
this
process
is
purely
ministerial,
to
provide
this
brief
time
period
for
negotiations.
and
if
either
of
those
parties
to
the
negotiation,
either
the
railroad
or
the
trail
proponents
on
the
other
hand,
do
not
voluntarily
wish
for
whatever
reason
to
consummate
an
agreement,
the
icc
has
no
authority
to
compel
an
agreement
or
even
if
you
listen
to
their
words,
to
lean
very
hard
on
people
to
convince
them
that
that's
what
they
ought
to
be
doing.
it's
a
purely
ministerial
icc
action
to
facilitate
voluntary
agreement
between
the
railroads--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--that
is
the
icc's
only
role
here,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
yes.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
in
a
reversionary
situation,
justice
scalia,
what
the
icc
does
is
to
first
rule
that
the
railroad
may
abandon
the
right
of
way--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--and
then
if
some
agency
has
indicated
interest
in
transforming
the
right
of
way
into
a
recreational
trail,
the
icc
issues
one
of
two
documents.
either
what
it
calls
a
certificate
of
interim
trail
use
or
abandonment,
or
a
notice
of
interim
trail
use
or
abandonment.
it
grants
the
parties
180
days
to
negotiate.
and
if
they
reach
agreement,
then
they
reach
agreement,
and
it's
transformed
into
a
recreational
trail.
if
they
don't
reach
agreement,
then
that
certificate
automatically,
without
further
icc
action,
transforms
into
a
complete
certificate
of
abandonment
and
the
railroad
goes
on
its
way.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
justice
stevens,
the
railroads
i'm
sure
have
thought
this
was
a
wonderful
idea.
they
are
in
the
non-fee
situation
in
the
easement
situation,
selling
something
that
they
were
willing
to
simply
walk
away
from.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
in
some
cases
it
is,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
since
what
we
have
is
two
government
agencies,
i'm
not
sure
whether
there
was
consideration
paid.
in
the
more
standard
situation
where
you
have
a
private
railroad
negotiating,
the
records
are
clear
that
the
railroads
are
in
fact
being
paid
for
the
transfer
of
this
interest,
whereas
the
underlying
fee
owners
are
receiving
nothing.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
if
the
court
has
further
inquiry,
i'd
be
happy
to
respond.
otherwise,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
touch
briefly
on
the
question
raised
by
the
solicitor
general--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--we
are
seeking
invalidation
of
the
statute,
justice
white.
that
is
our
belief...
that
the
statute,
as
written,
cannot
constitutionally
stand.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
both
the
second
circuit
and
the
icc
need
to
be
reversed
because
they
were
operating
under
the
assumption
that
this
was
a
valid
statute
which
authorized
this
sort
of
a
transmogrification
of
private
property
into
public
property
without
even
consulting
the
property
owners.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
once
that's
done,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
we're
going
to
have
to
go
back
to
court.
my
clients
began
this
litigation,
as
the
record
shows,
as
a
quiet
title
litigation
in
the
vermont
state
courts.
they
were
unable
to
reach
the
merits
of
that
action
because
the
vermont
supreme
court
said
you
first
have
to
get
the
icc
to
sign
off
on
its
jurisdiction.
so
we
came
to
the
icc
to
try
to
get
the
icc
to
sign
off
and
what
they
did
was
to
convert
the
property
into
a
bike
trail
for
the
city
of
burlington.
if
we
can
get
the
appropriate
ruling
from
this
court
which
will
free
us
of
those
constraints
placed
by
both
the
second
circuit
and
the
icc,
then
we'll
be
able
to
find
out
under
vermont
law--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--what
we
have.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
if
they
had
reached
that
issue
and
made
that
decision,
the
case
wouldn't
be
here.
i'd
have
been
sort
of
startled
had
they
done
that,
given
what
i
know
of
vermont
law.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
think,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
i
don't
believe
that's
here.
what
both
the--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--that
is
my
understanding,
justice
scalia,
of
the
posture
of
this
case.
that
both
the
icc
and
the
second
circuit
made
that
assumption
and
based
their
rulings
on
the
assumption.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
if
the
court
wished
to
take
that
action,
of
course,
that--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--perhaps
they
would
be
delayed,
your
honor,
rather
than
avoided,
if
that
were
done.
and
the--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--well,
that's
where
we
were
before
and
that's
why
we
need
the
icc's--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--ruling
on
whether
there
is
an
abandonment
or
not.
mr.
michael
m.
berger
the
icc
has
effectively
done
that,
your
honor,
subject
only
to
this
trails
act
conversion
which
takes
place
after
they
decide
that
abandonment
is
appropriate.
as
they
say,
in
every
trails
act
case
they
first
decide
that
they
don't
need
this
property
for
railroad
use.
then
they
reach
that
issue.
so,
the
icc
has
reached
that
question--
mr.
michael
m.
berger
--thank
you.
