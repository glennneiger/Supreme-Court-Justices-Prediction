justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
said
until
the
icc
issues
a
certificate
of
abandonment,
the
railway
property
remains
subject
to
the
icc's
jurisdiction,
and
state
law
may
not
cause
a
reverter
of
the
property.
and
it
said
the
vermont
supreme
court
recognized
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
no
reverter
until
there
is
an
abandonment.
that's
what
it
seems
to
me
the
court
of
appeals
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
we're
reviewing
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
doesn't
the...
doesn't
the
court
of
appeals
have
power
to
review
whether
or
not
the
icc
has
the
authority
to
refuse
to
issue
a
certificate
of
abandonment?
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
so
how
do
you
go
about
that?
why
did
it
have
the
authority
to
refuse
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
--issue
the
certificate
of
abandonment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
refused
to
consider
the
constitutionality
of
it,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
therefore
there
is
a...
therefore
the
icc's
decision
has
to
be
turned
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
some
point
you
can't
win
unless
and
until
you
show
that
some
property
has
been...
that
your
client
has
a
property
interest.
justice
byron
r.
white
--we
wouldn't
be
facing
any...
much
of
a
problem
here
if
it
had
been
decided
in
vermont
that
your
client
didn't
have
a
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
but
we
still...
if
the
vermont
supreme
court
said
that
no
reversionary
interest
arises
until
there
is...
until
the
icc
has
issued
a
certificate
of
abandonment--
