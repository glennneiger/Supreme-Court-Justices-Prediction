justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
fee
situation
as
opposed
to
the
reversionary
situation,
does
the
commission
show
any
interest
in
the
consideration
that
the
railroad
might
receive
in
connection
with
the
transaction?
i
assume
these
must
be
fairly
profitable
for
the
railroads
in
the
fee
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
non-fee
reversionary
situation
is
consideration
paid
to
the
railroad
by
the
trail
people
or
the
transferees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
may
be
the
general
test.
but,
you
know,
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
about
this
case
is
you'd
have
to
wonder
if
congress
would
have
enacted
this
particular
statute
if
they
would
have
thought
they
were
incurring
a
very--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--substantial
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statute
seems
to
be
structured
in
a
way
with
this
concept
of
railroad
banking
which
is
somewhat
artificial--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
would
think
because
i
guess
most
of
these
right
of
ways
are
not
going
to
be
used
for
future
railroad...
it
looks
like
it
was
a
devise
to
avoid
financial
responsibility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
would
think
it
would
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yeah.
they
might
buy
the
second
circuit's
rationale.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it
would
be
the
united
states'
interest
to
know
as
promptly
as
possible
whether
this
would
be
considered
a
taking.
and
i
understand
that
the
interest--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--pardon
me?
whether...
assuming
there
is
a
reversionary
interest...
and
we
don't
really
know
that
yet--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
i
understood
the
second
circuit
to
say
we
don't
reach
that
question.
but...
but
if
there
were
one...
and
this
is
kind
of
a
test
case
for
a
whole
lot
of
other
cases...
i...
i
understand
your
arguing
the
law,
but
i
would
think
that
the
united
states
would
have
a
great
interest
knowing
as
soon
as
possible
whether
they
have
this
financial
obligation
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
regulations
or
rules
that
tell
the
trail
sponsor
what
kind
of
steps
he
must
take
to
preserve
it
for
rail
purposes?
supposing
they
start
building
walls
up
and
down
and
change
it
totally?
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
rail
sponsor
from
doing
anything
that
would
make
it
effective
in
the--
