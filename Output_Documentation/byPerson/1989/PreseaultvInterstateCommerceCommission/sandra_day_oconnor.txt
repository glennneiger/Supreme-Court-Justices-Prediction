mr.
nance...
excuse
me...
mr.
berger,
is
it
possible
that
the
state
law
that
applies
to
define
the
property
interest
of
your
clients
would
take
into
account
the
federal
determinations
of
public
purpose
or
railway
use?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
possible
that
the
state
law
determination
would
look
back
at
the
federal
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
here,
of
course,
they
may
take
the
position
that
there
still
has
been
no
abandonment
because
of
the
ultimate
reserved
potential
use.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
you
are
correct
so
far,
i
suppose
it's
arguable
that
you
still
have
a
tucker
act
remedy
for
your
clients
to
get
compensation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general
and
think
you
do
have
a
tucker
act
remedy?
what
do
we
do
in
this
case?
affirm
the
judgment
on
a
different
ground?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
also
don't
know
what
the
vermont
law
is
as
yet,
do
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
the
argument
they
make
is
that
the
amendments
to
the
appropriations
act
withdraw
that
authority--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--when
there
are
no
funds.
how
do
you
deal
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it
says
authority
to
enter
contracts
shall
be
effective
only
to
the
extent
or
in
such
amounts
as
are
provided
in
advance
by
appropriation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
congress
also
said
in
this
act
in
section
1247(d)
that
interim
use...
the
rail-for-trail
interim
use...
shall
not
be
treated
for
any
rule
of
law
as
an
abandonment
of
the
use
of
such
right
of
way
for
railroad
purposes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
is
that
an
attempt
to
foreclose
any
claim,
even
a
tucker
act
claim?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
seems
like
a
direct
attempt
to
avoid
exactly
this
situation
of
a
potential
tucker
act
claim
for
a
taking.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
do
agree
that
state
law
ultimately
will
determine
the
extent
and
nature
of
the
petitioners'
interest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
this
case
you
would--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--say
vermont
law
should
determine?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
but
suppose
that
under
a
given
state
law...
forget
vermont
for
a
minute...
under
a
given
state
law
the
state
would
recognize
a
reversionary
interest
despite
the
fact
that
the
icc
had
said
we're
going
to
put
this
under
rails
for
trails.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
isn't
that
a
taking
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
commerce--
--well,
i
mean,
why
doesn't
the
policy
have
to
yield
to
the
fifth
amendment
takings
clause?
i
just
don't
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
under
state
law
a
reversionary
interest
would
be
recognized
and
the
federal
government
has
somehow
legislated
and
acted
so
as
to
take
that
reversionary
interest,
why
isn't
compensation
required?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
by
acting
under
the
commerce
clause
the
federal
government
can
avoid
always
having
any
takings
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
can
put
somebody
in
physical
possession
of
the
reversionary
interest--
--not
always.
--and
there's
no
taking
because
it's
under
the
commerce
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
can
do
it
for
railroads?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
an
amazing
argument.
what's
your
closest
authority
for
this
amazing
argument
in
this
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
this
property...
the
easement
was
acquired
many
years
ago
for
the
purpose
of
putting
on
the
railroad,
that
it
required
acquisition
of
the
easement.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
exactly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
without
paying
the
railroad
the
value
of
what
was
taken?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
takings
clause
would
require
that?
