mr.
berger,
do
you
have
any
idea
how...
how
expensive
a
pig
in
the
poke
this
statute
would
have
been
if...
if
indeed
it's
to
be
interpreted
the
way
the
government
says
as
simply
authorizing
the
taking
of
land
and
we'll
pay
the
bill
later
when
it's
presented?
do
you
have
any
idea
how
much--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
much
money
you're
talking
about
for
all
these
rights
of
ways
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
you
know
what
percentage
of
those...
well,
i'm
sure
you
don't...
what
percentage
contain
a
reversionary
interest?
is
that
more
common
or
more
unusual?
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
for
this
type
of
land
what?
what
does
the
icc
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
in
a
reversionary
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
icc--
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
say
the
1983
amendments?
justice
antonin
scalia
amendments
to
the
trails
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
the
whole
program
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
1983
program.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
effectively
this
provision
is
contained
in
the
act
that
we
have
before
us.
it's
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
provision
is
just
not
an
amendment
to
that
act
that
was
adopted
later.
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--part
and
parcel
of
the
whole
package.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
martin,
would
you
tell
me
what
you
think
this
provision
does
mean
if
it
doesn't
coyer
the
situation
of
action
taken
under
the
act
which...
which
must
be
compensated
for?
what
does
the
provision
cover
when
it
says,
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision
authority
to
make
payments
under
this
act
shall
be
effective
only
to
the
extent
and
in
such
amounts
as
are
provided
in
advance
in
appropriations
act?
"
you
mean
to
make
payments
that
the
act
names
in
dollar
amounts?
are
there
payments
that
are
named
in
the
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
gave
money
figures
for
other
purposes?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
read
under
this
act
to
mean
to
make
payments
in
amounts
specifically
specified
under
this
act,
not
to
make
payments
required
under
this
act?
i
mean,
you'll
agree
that
if
there
is
a
taking,
the
payment
is
required
by
reason
of
this
act,
not
by
reason
of
the
tucker
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
that's
not
very
appealing
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
even
though
you
say
for
railroad
purposes,
it
doesn't
mean
for...
it
means
for
any
purposes.
that's
equivalent
to
giving
a
highway
easement?
do
you
think
your
state
could...
could
use
those
highway
easements
for
amusement
parks
in
the
future?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
don't
care
whether
it's...
you
know,
it's
a
cart
or
a
truck,
it's
still
a
highway.
but
how
is
that
comparable
to
saying
that
when
a
property
owner
gives
a...
gives
an
easement
saying
so
long
as
it
is
used
for
railroad
purposes.
what...
what
does
it
mean
if
it
doesn't
mean
so
long
as
it's
used
for
railroad
purposes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
not
for
a
bike
trail
or
a
hiking
path?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
an
amusement
park?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
doubt
that
when
the
person
gives
an
easement
he
knows
that
the
federal
government
is
going
to
determine
the
nature
of
that
railroad,
whether
it
can
run,
whether
it
can't
run,
whether
the
easement
has
to
be
abandoned.
and
i'll
even
be
willing
to
concede,
if
you
like,
that
he
knows
that
the
federal
government
might
pass
an
act
like
this
that
says
in
the
future
that
is
going
to
be
used
for
a
bike
path.
but
he
doesn't
know
that
in
the
future
the
icc
is
going
to
be
able
to
override
the
fifth
amendment
by
saying
in
the
future
that's
going
to
be
used
for
a
bike
path
even
though
we
have
no
right
to
do
it
and
we're
not
going
to
pay
you.
the
issue
here,
it
seems
to
me,
is
not
whether
the
icc
has
authority.
does
anybody
contest
that
the
icc
has
authority
to
do
this
if
it
wants
to
with
payment?
the
only
issue
is
whether
it
overrides
the
fifth
amendment.
and
what
case
do
you
have
that
shows
that
the
icc
can
displace
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
don't
have
to...
really
have
to
decide
whether
your
client
has
a
property
interest
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
we
don't
really
have
to
decide
vermont
law
at
all.
we
can
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
purposes
of
this
case
we
assume
that
he
has
a
property
interest.
