justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
this
case
the
prohibition
against
expenditures
of
the
money
may
have
referred
to
expenditures
other
than
expenditures
for
takings,
i.e.,
staff
to
negotiate
these
easements
and
so
forth.
i
don't
think
you
necessarily
can
construe
this
statute
as
applying
only
to
payments
for
takings.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
my
point
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
language,
it
seems
to
me,
can
be
given
some
effect
and
still
allow
a
tucker
act
claim.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose...
suppose
there
is
a
property
with
a
railroad
easement
on
it
and
a
reversion,
the
reversion
to
take
effect
when
the
easement
is
no
longer
used
for
railroad
purposes,
and
the
icc
says,
we're
pretty
sure
that
this
route
will
be
used
in
25
years
and
therefore
we
do
not
allow
an
abandonment.
is
that
a
taking
of
the
property?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
including
future
railroad
use,
based
on
what
you've
told
us
earlier
that
the
statute
requires?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
railroads
ever
remove
tracks
and
trestles
and
ties
but
keep
the
right
of
way
because
of
the
possibility
of
future
use,
i.e.,
that
they'd
then
lay
down
new,
more
modern
tracks
and
so
forth?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
the
act
would
have
substantial
effect
if
it
were
confined
to
the
cases
in
which
the
railroad
does
own
the
fee.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
doesn't
this
statute
set
forth
a
policy
to
encourage
the
icc
to
work
with
the
railroads
to
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
we
were
to
find
that
this
act
does
effect
a
taking,
if
there
is
a
reversionary
interest--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
suppose
that
taking
of
reversionary
interests
amount
to
$20
million
a
year.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
consistent
with
the
congressional
intent
and
with
the
purpose
of
this
act
for
the
government
of
the
united
states
to
argue
that
the
claims
court
should
dole
out
$20
million
a
year
when
the
congress
thought
it
wouldn't
cost
a
dime?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
curious
evolution
of
federalism
that
a
state
would
be
before
us
arguing
that
under
the
commerce
clause
the
federal
government
can
take
property
rights
that
a
state
could
not
itself
take.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
we
might
want
to
avoid
dealing
with
some
of
these
issues
by
certifying
the
question
to
the
vermont
supreme
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
could
avoid
all
sorts
of
constitutional
arguments.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
no.
not
if
the
vermont
court
said
there
is
no
property
interest
here,
the
reversion
doesn't
ripen
until
there
is
an
abandonment.
