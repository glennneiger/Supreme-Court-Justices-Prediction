mr.
brian
j.
martin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
i
would
like
to
respond
to
justice
kennedy's
last
question.
the
statute
does
apply
and
has
meaning
in
the
fee
simple
situation
and
the
railroad's
incentive
in
that
type
of
case
would
be
to
not
abandon
the
railroad
right
of
way
because
once
it
is
abandoned,
the
icc
grants
a
certificate
of
abandonment.
if
20
years
later
the
railroad
wants
to
resume
service,
they
would
have
to
go
through
the
initial
application
under
10903
of
the
interstate
commerce
act
for
constructing
a
railroad
and
getting
permission
to
run
a
railroad,
which
involves
a
more
lengthy
process.
under
this
scheme,
if
they
resume
service
in
the
future,
even
in
the
fee
simple
situation,
all
they
would
have
to
do
is
notify
the
commission.
so,
the
statute
applies
to
all
railroad
rights
of
way.
it
has
incentives
to
apply
in
every
type
of
situation.
the
court
could
affirm
the
decision
of
the
icc,
and
this
is
an
action
for
judicial
review,
on
any
of
three
grounds.
we
urge
the
court
to
affirm
on
the
tucker
act
ground,
that
even
if
there
is
a
taking,
there
is
an
available
remedy
for
compensation,
which
is
all
the
constitution
requires,
and
that
remedy
is
the
tucker
act.
the
two
other
possible
grounds
would
be
under
vermont
law
or,
as
the
second
circuit
held,
the
statute
may
never
result
in
a
taking
in
either...
in
any
case,
in
any
conceivable
case.
we
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
resolve
the
case
under
vermont
law
for
essentially
three
reasons.
in
the
first
place,
the
commission
did
not
look
to
vermont
law,
did
not
resolve
this
case
on
the
basis
of
vermont
law,
and
this
is--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--no,
it
didn't.
it
held
that
the
statute
may
never
result
in
the
taking
in
any
case.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
right.
the
vermont
supreme
court
would
not
issue
an
opinion
on
the
title
as
long
as
the
icc
retained
jurisdiction
over
the
right
of
way
if
it
had
not
issued--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--well,
if
it
held...
if
it
gave
its
views
of
vermont
law,
if...
if
that's
an
interpretation
of
vermont
law,
so
be
it.
but
the
icc
did
not
rest
its
decision
on
vermont
law.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
you're
also
reviewing
a
decision
of
an
agency.
this
is
an
action
for
judicial
review.
and
under
sec
against
chenery,
the
court
generally
confines
its
review
to
the
explanation
given
by
the
agency
for
its
decision.
and
the
agency
does
not
want
to
get
into
the
business
of
deciding
title
questions
under
state
law.
the
agency
believes
that
the
tucker
act
is
available
if
there
is
a
plausible
or
compensable--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--certainly.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
well,--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
icc
acted
in
accordance
with
its
authority
under
section
8(d)
of
the
trails
act.
under
that
statute,
the
icc--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--it
did...
the
icc
has
expressed
its
opinion
that
it's
constitutional
because
there
is
an
available
remedy,
the
tucker
act,
for
compensation.
it
did
not
express
an
opinion
on
whether
or
not
there
is
a
taking
in
this
particular
case,
a
taking
of
property.
whether
or
not
there
is,
it's
still
constitutional
because
the
government
of
the
united
states
will
pay
if
you
file
and
prove
your
case
under
the
tucker
act.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
the
hooe
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
government's
action
must
be
authorized.
well,
the
icc's
decision
is
authorized.
it's
explicitly
authorized
by
section
8(d)
of
the
trails
act.
therefore,
the...
question
comes
down
to
is
the
tucker
act
available?
if
it
is,
then
the
united
states
will
pay
for
the
icc's
action.
so
it's
another
way
to
rephrase
the
central
question,
is
the
tucker
act
available.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
exactly.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
well,
that's
clearly...
their
main
argument
is
that
section
101
of
the
1983
amendments
is
an
unambiguous
withdrawal
of
the
tucker
act
remedy.
and
that's
the
test,
the
test
under
the
regional
rail
cases
in
monsanto
is
that
it
must
be
an
unambiguous
withdrawal
of
the
tucker
act
remedy.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
yes.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
to
the
trails
act.
the
trails
act
was
passed
in
1968.
in
1983
they
amended
it
with
trails
purposes
and
railroad
purposes.
so
we're
talking
about
section
8(d)
of
the
trails
act
which
was
added
by
the
1983
amendments.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
the
rails-to-trails
program
is
a
1983
program.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
that's
right.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
no.
it's--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--it's
an
uncodified
provision
of
the
1983
amendments,
and
the
1983
amendments
is
the
rails-to-trails
scheme.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
it
is
not
an
unambiguous
switch
to
the
tucker
act
remedy,
however,
for
two
reasons.
the
provision
says
that
any
payment
under
the
1983
amendments
must
be
made
in
accordance
with
an
appropriations
law.
we
think,
in
the
first
place,
that
a
payment
under
the
fifth
amendment
for
a
takings
claim
could
not
be
a
payment
under
the
1983
amendments.
the
1983
amendments
have--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--the
icc
has
entered
into
no
contract
in
this
case.
so
the...
provision
they're
relying
on
is
the
authority
to
make
payment.
they're
saying
that
the
government
has
no
authority
to
make
a
payment
under
the
tucker
act.
we
think
that
101
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
tucker
act.
it
has
to
do
with
payments
made
under
the
1983
amendments.
and
those
amendments
did
a
lot
of
things.
they
designated
new
scenic
trails,
authorized
expenditures
for
markers
for
trails
and
acquisition
of
other
lands.
that's
what
101
deals
with.
also,
101
restates
the
constitutional
command
found
in
article
i,
section
9.
no
payments
may
be
made
without
an
appropriation
of
congress.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
uh-huh.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
uh-huh.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
i
think
it
is
consistent,
certainly
under
the
principles
for
reconciling
the
tucker
act
and
other
statutes,
as
this
court's
announced
in
monsanto.
it's
consistent
for
the
following
reasons.
when
we
first...
finish
answering
justice
o'connor's
question
which
also
applies
to
your
question...
congress
has
appropriated
money
for
takings.
there
is
a
permanent
standing
appropriation,
31
usc
1304,
to
pay
inverse
condemnation
claims,
to
pay
tucker
act
claims.
we're
informed
maybe
the
united
states
pays
perhaps
$25
million
a
year
for
inverse
condemnation
claims
under
statutes
such
as
the
national
wild
and
scenic
rivers
act
and
mining
statutes,
various
statutes.
water
project
acts,
agricultural
statutes.
in
all
those
cases,
congress
legislated
against
the
background
of
the
tucker
act
with
the
knowledge
that
takings
claims
would
be
resolved
by
the
claims
court.
i
think
in
1983
congress
did
not
focus
on
whether
or
not
there
would
be
a
takings.
that's
why
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history.
that's
the
same
thing--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--uh-huh.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
no.
that
is
an
attempt
to
override
state
law,
which
gives
rise
to
plausible
takings
claims.
without
that
provision,
once
the
railroad
ceased
operating
an
active
railroad
and
turned
it
into
a
bike
path,
under
state
law
there
might
be--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--it
was
a
direct
attempt
to
make
sure
that
there
would
be
available
bike
paths.
it's
not
in
reference
to
the
tucker
act
or
available
compensation.
i
don't
think
congress
thought
about
a
taking,
and
i
don't
know
how
many
takings
there
will
be.
the
statute
has
been
in
effect
for
six
years;
there's
not
been
one
claim
filed
under
the
tucker
act
in
the
claims
court.
if
there
are...
i
mean,
many
of
these
railroad
rights
of
way
are
held
in
fee;
others
are
held
by
easements
broad
enough
to
cover
another
use.
and
to
answer
your
question
of
earlier
on,
many
state
laws
have
developed
to
the
point
to
encourage
this
type
of
conversion
themselves.
so
there
may
be
a
state
law
taking.
i
don't
know.
but
there
would
not
be
a
federal
law
taking.
that's
why
we
don't
know
how
much
the
government
would
be
liable
in
a
claims
court,
but
that's
what
the
claims
court
is
for
and
that's
what
the
judgment
to
fund
a
permanent
appropriation
is
for.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
yes.
there
are
a
number...
the
1983
amendments
covered
a
number
of
areas
that
designated
new
scenic
trails,
designated
markers.
it
authorized
expenditures.
it
gave
money
figures.
it
authorized
amounts
but
it
was
not
an
appropriations
law.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
for
other
purposes--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--it
gave
money
figures.
for
acquiring
certain
trails
as
part
of
the
national
trails
system.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
by
reason
of
this
act
and
by
reason
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
i
mean,
it's
probably
more
natural
to
say
it's
required
by
the
fifth
amendment
than
by
this
act.
that's
the
way
the
courts
describe
takings
claims,
as
founded
upon
the
constitution.
but
even
if
this
101
would
apply
to
a
takings
claim,
the
requirement
is
an
appropriations
law.
now,
in
many
cases,
many
expenditures
under
the
act,
i
don't
know
if
the
funds
were
appropriated
to
acquire
all
this
land
or
to
buy
the
scenic
markers
and
the
like.
that
would...
that
requires
a
separate
bill,
of
course.
but
there
is
an
appropriation
to
pay
for
takings
claims.
so,
the
two
statutes
can
be
read
consistently.
and
the
court
need
not
struggle
too
much.
and,
of
course,
the
test
is
is
there
an
unambiguous
withdrawal.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
exactly.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
we
wondered
about
that
too.
and
congress
has
a
history
of
paying
for
this
type
of
thing.
the--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--uh-huh.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
and
it
may
work
if
state--
[laughter]
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--if
state
law...
state
law
may
have
developed
to
the
point
where
they
defer
to
the
icc's
abandonment
authority,
whatever
that
is.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
right.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
this
particular
case
would
be
considered--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--right.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
well,
there
are
so
many
different
hypothetical
cases
that...
that
resolving
one
particular
case
under
vermont
law
and
under
a
particular
right
of
way
would
not
help
the
united
states
that
much.
a
holding
under
the
tucker
act
would.
that
would
mean
the
icc
will
continue
its
business
and
we
would
litigate
takings
claims
in
the
claims
court
where
we
always
do.
there
we
would
examine
the
interests,
we'd
examine
state
law,
we
would
examine
the
federal
overlay
and
the
like.
so
that's
the
interests
of
the
united
states.
i
wish
we
could
know...
resolve
them
all
in
one
case
but
we
don't
think
that
we
can.
the
commerce
clause
argument
i
think
is
just
a
variation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
i
think
in
this
case
that's
true.
there
are
some
rights
of
ways
which
are
granted
under
federal
statutes,
so
federal
law
would
have
something
to
say
with
it.
and
there
is
also
possible
argument
that
any
interests
acquired
since
1983
would
have
been
taken
subject
to
the
federal
statute
we're
talking
about
today.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
that's
right.
thank
you.
