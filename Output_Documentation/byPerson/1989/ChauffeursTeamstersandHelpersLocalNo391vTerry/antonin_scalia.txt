mr.
james,
we're
not
talking
about
any
tort-like
recovery
here,
are
we?
are
we
only
talking
about
giving
to
the
union
member
a
fixed
monetary
sum
that
would
have
been
his
but
for
the
action
of
the
union,
or
are
we
talking
about
some
smart
money
against
the
union
or
some
tort-like--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
know,
but
is
it...
well,
but
to
make
it
really
analogous
to
those
trust
actions
don't
you
have
to
say
that
what
this
individual
is
getting
is
precisely
what
the
union
would
have
obtained
had
it
acted...
would
have
obtained
on
his
behalf
had
it
acted
properly?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
no
element
of
it
is...
is
a
sort
of
tortious
recovery
against
the
union.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
does
making
whole
consist
of?
does
it
consist
of
the...
the
employee's
pain
and
suffering,
his
emotional
upset
at
not...
any
of
those
elements
ever
included?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
only
consists
of
what
he
would
have
gotten
from
the
employer
had
the
union
acted...
acted
properly?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
give
me
an
example
of...
of
where
discretion
would
be
exercised
not
to...
not
to
give
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you
think
that
in
a...
in
a
duty
of
fair
representation
case
you
could
similarly
not...
not
award
any
relief
against...
against
the
union
on
the
basis
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
very
true,
but
the
only...
the
only
element
of
the
union's
role
at
issue
in
this
case
is
its...
is
its
obligation
fairly
to
represent
its
employees.
justice
antonin
scalia
--sometimes
the
trustee
has
to
play
a
role
as
lawyer...
i
mean,
when
he
has
a
claim
on
behalf
of
the
trust
against
someone
that
he
fails
to
prosecute,
either
by
prosecuting
it
himself
if
he's
a
lawyer,
or
hiring
a
lawyer,
you
have
a
cause
of
action
against
the
trustee,
but
it's
purely
an
equitable
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
well
be,
but
you'd
still...
the
decision
of
whether
to
prosecute
or
not
is
a
decision
of
the
trustee
and
he'd
be...
he'd
be
suable
in
equity.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
lawyer
did
a
bad
job
in
prosecuting
this
suit,
i
guess
that...
you
might
have
a
malpractice
action
against
him,
although
i'm
not
sure
that
that
wouldn't
have
to
be
brought
in
equity
too.
but
the
problem
here
is
not
that
he
was
a
bad
lawyer.
the
problem
is
he
didn't
bring
a
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you...
you
mentioned
at
the
outset
that
part
of
your
claim
includes
moving
expenses.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
do
they
consist
of?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
would
have
been
moved
anyway.
i
mean,
how
can
you
get
both
the
wages
and
the
moving
expenses?
aren't
the
two
inconsistent?
if
you
would
have
gotten
the
wages,
you
would
have
incurred
the
moving
expenses.
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you,
mr.
elliot.
mr.
james,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
