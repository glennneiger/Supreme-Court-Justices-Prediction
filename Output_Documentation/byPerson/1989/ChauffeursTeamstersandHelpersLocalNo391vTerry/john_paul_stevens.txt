yes,
but
is...
aren't
those
cases
in
which,
had
the
trustee
acted
properly
in
the
first
instance,
the
trustee
would
have
recovered
money
damages
in
a
jury
trial
from
the...
from
the
third
party?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
beneficiary
couldn't.
but
i'm
assuming
a
case
in
which
the
third
party
caused
some
injury
to
the
trust,
embezzled
some
money
or
something
like
that,
for
which
the
trustee,
suing
on
behalf
of
the
trust,
would
have
had
a
remedy
at
law.
there
would
be
such--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
would
be
something
like...
sort
of
like
a
derivative
suit
where
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
that
the
corporation
might
have
a
remedy
at
law
and
the
shareholder
in...
before
the
merger
of
law
and
equity,
and
all
the
rest,
the
shareholder
could
have
had,
you
know,
had
an
equitable
proceeding
which
would
have
brought
something
comparable
to
the
damages
that
you
describe
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
i
know
perfectly
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
but
there
is
an
analogy
in
this
sense.
that
the
member
of
the
labor
union
may
not
directly
sue
the
employer
because
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
there.
so
he
has
to
really
basically...
basically
has
to
rely
on
the
union
as
the
intermediary
to
process
grievances
and
all
of
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
one
question,
mr.
james?
i'm
just
not...
just
to
show
my
ignorance.
but,
just
as
a
general
practice
in
this
kind
of
litigation,
have
there
been
a
fair
number
of
jury
trials
or...
are
these
cases
often
tried
to
juries?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
different...
different
views
among
the
circuits.
