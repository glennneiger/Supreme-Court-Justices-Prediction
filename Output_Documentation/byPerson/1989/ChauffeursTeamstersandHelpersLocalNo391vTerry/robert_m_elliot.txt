mr.
robert
m.
elliot
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
there
are
legal
issues
and
remedies
involved
in
this
case
which
must
be
tried
before
a
jury.
if
there
are,
this
court
has
said
in
its
past
decisions,
that
the
seventh
amendment
applies
and
that
my
clients,
or
respondents,
are
entitled
to
a
jury
trial.
now,
in
response...
or
in
his
argument,
the
petitioner
states,
or
tries
to
wrap
the
entire
action
in
a
trust
cloak,
so
to
speak,
and
tries
to
say
that
because
this
action
has
some
resemblance
to
a
trust,
that
that
analogy
should
pervade
the
entire
analysis
and
go
off
over
to
the
second
prong
of
the
ross
test.
and,
therefore,
since
there
maybe
some
resemblance
to
a
trust,
that
the
remedy
sought
in
this
case
should
be
considered
trust
remedy.
we
contend
that
that
analogy
does
not
fit
for
a
number
of
reasons.
it's
important
to
remember
at
the
outset
that
in
this
case
are
talking
at
this
point
in
time
about
an
action
against
the
union
alone.
the
company
is
bankrupt
and
we
have
an
action
against
the
union
saying
that
the
union
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation
and
as
a
result,
a
direct
result
of
that
breach,
we
have
lost
the
opportunity
to
earn
wages.
compensatory...
traditional
compensatory
monetary
relief.
in...
i
would
like
to
begin
with--
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
--our
damage
will
be...
damages
will
be
measured
by
what
these
respondents
would
have
made
in...
in
their
wages
if
they--
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
--if
they
had
been
successful
in
arbitration.
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
at
this
point
there
are
no
other
damages
involved.
there
are
some
moving
expenses
which
may
classify
as
compensatory
relief
as
well.
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
i
think
the
answer
should
be
the
same.
but
perhaps
it's
not
quite
as
clear.
in
a
case
against
the
union,
this
more
clearly
can
be
analogized
to
a
legal
malpractice
case
because
we
have
no
company
to
pay
the
damages
and
we're
going
against
the
union,
and
that's
where
the
focus
is.
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
well,
that...
one
side
of
the
vaca
standards
would
be
satisfied
by
a
breach
of
contract
issue.
and
there
is
clearly
a
legal
issue
there.
the--
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
--the
only
way
it
changes...
i
don't
think
it
really
changes
the
constitutional
analysis.
but
it
does
change
the
analogy
to
some
extent
because
since
we
are
suing
the
union
only
in
this
case
at
this
point
in
time
as
a
representative,
then
it's
more
analogous
to
a
legal
malpractice
case
where
you
are
suing
the
lawyer
for
failing
to
represent
you
before
a
court
or
an
arbitration
panel.
and
our
damages
all
flow
in
this
case,
at
this
point
in
time,
from
the
breach
of
the
union
agent
in
failing
to
represent
us.
and
since
we
are
not
suing
the
company
at
this
time,
our
damages
are
not
flowing
from
the
actual
breach
of
contract.
i
would
like
to
set
out
some
of
the
facts
before
i
get
too
far
along.
but
before
i
do
so,
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind,
especially
in
considering
this
trust
analogy,
the
various
roles
that
a
union
plays
as
an
agent
of
its
members.
it's
not
always
in
this,
quote,
"trustee's
discretionary
role".
obviously,
as
a
negotiator
in
negotiating
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
a
union
is
playing
a
role
that
requires
expertise
and
requires
a
great
deal
of
discretion
in
considering
all
aspects
of
the
labor
management
relationship.
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
that's
my
point,
your
honor.
my
point
is
that
in
this
case
we're
not
talking
about
a
great
discretionary
duty.
we're
talking
about
an
absolute
duty
to
these
union
members
to
represent
them
on
a
grievance,
which
is
a
duty
much
more
akin
to
the
duty
of
a
lawyer
than
it
is
to
the
duty
of
a
trustee.
the
facts
bear
this
out.
the
essence
of
our
case
is
discrimination.
the
change
of
operation
procedure
was
designed
to
allow
my
clients
the
right
to
follow
their
work
to
winston-salem.
at
the
time
they
followed
their
work
they
were
supposed
to
have
some
seniority
preferences
because
they
were
following
their
work,
theoretically.
the
order
of
recalls
and
layoffs
after
that
were
in
direct
violation
of
that
procedure
which
had
been
devised
by
the
collective
bargaining
procedure.
at
that
time
we
have
alleged
that
the
union,
in
direct
discrimination
or
blatant
discrimination
against
my
clients,
sided
with
the
locals,
the
local
inactive
people
who
had
been
off
the
board,
to
try
to
bring
them
back
on
the
board,
at
which
time
they
would
dovetail
in
my
clients
seniority.
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
the...
the
active
employment.
the
active
board
in
this
case
would
be
the
list
of
truck
drivers
who
were
actually
getting
calls.
according
to
the
change
of
operations
procedure,
my
clients
were
supposed
to
have
seniority
over
the
people
who
were
actively
working...
i
mean,
over
the
people
who
were
not
actively
working,
regardless
of
their
continuous
company
seniority
when
they
came
in.
we
have
contended
that
the
union
in
this
case
discriminated,
that
they
sided
with
the
locals
to
try
to
get
the
locals
back
on
the
board...
the
active
employment...
so
that
they
would
all
dovetail
and
my
clients
would
lose
their
rights.
that
was
the
first
aspect
of
our
case,
and
everything...
flowed
from
there.
then
the
first
decision
was
decided,
which
decided
exactly
that.
the
order
of
recalls
had
been
a
violation,
and
a
clear
violation,
of
the
change
of
operations
procedure
in
the
contract
even
though
the
union...
the
union
had
gone
along
with
that...
that
interpretation
and
that
order
of
recall.
and
the
grievance
committee
found
it
was
a
clear
violation.
a
week
later
the
union
and
the
company
got
together
and
decided
that
we
are
going
to
do
exactly
what
the
decision
said,
we're
calling
back
the...
the
foreign
drivers...
my
clients
who
were
laid
off
in
direct
violation
of
the
agreement.
we'll
call
them
back...
that's
30
drivers...
and
we're
going
to
lay
off
the
30
local
drivers
who
had
not
been
active.
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
well,
your
honor,
the
point
i'm
trying
to
get
to
is...
is
that
at
that
point
in
time
the
union
played
a
role
as
lawyer.
it
accepted
a
grievance
that
this
was
a
subterfuge
and
that
this
was
a
circumvention
of
the
decision.
and
from
then
on,
it
took
that
grievance
to
the
grievance
committee
and
we
say
acted
perfunctorily
in
representing
our
clients
on
that
grievance
because--
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
--i
think
in
that
case
the
trustee
would
have
to
get
a
lawyer,
and
the
trustee
would
not
be
acting
in
the
role
of
the
lawyer
but
in
the
role
of
a
client.
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
that...
that
is--
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
--he
did
bring
the
lawsuit,
your
honor.
he...
he
filed
a
grievance
on
my
clients'
behalf,
that
the
actions
of
the
company
and
the
union
a
week
after
the
first
decision
was
a
subterfuge.
and
that's
the
words
that
are
used.
it
had
circumvented
the
decision
because
it
had
just
turned
everything
right
where
it
was
before
the
decision
applied.
at
that
time
he
filed
the
grievance.
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
your
honor,
we're
not
trying
to
set
aside
anything
in
this
case.
we're
suing
the
union
directly
for--
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
--for
its
breach.
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
lawyer.
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
in
that
respect.
now,
you
know...
and
there
are
other...
there
are
certainly
other
characteristics
of
this
action
which
are
not
so
close
to
a
lawyer,
and
i'm
not
denying
that.
but
i'm
just
saying
that's
probably
the
best
common
law
analog
to
the
case
in
its
posture
before
the
court
at
this
time.
but
there
are
several
other
reasons
the
trust
analogy
does
not
fit.
trust,
as
i
understand
it,
was
created
by
the
courts
of
equity
because
courts
of
law
did
not
recognize
the
distinction
between
legal
and
beneficial
title.
therefore,
beneficiaries...
beneficiaries
had
no
rights
before
courts
of
law
and
the
re...
courts
of
equity
recognized
rights...
that
there
was
no
adequate
remedy
at
law.
so
these
trusts...
beneficiaries
had
to
go
to
courts
of
equity.
there's
no
property
in
this
case.
and
that
was
it...
an
absolute
essential
element
of
a
trust,
that
there
be
a
corpus.
now
the
petitioner
tries
to
argue
that
the
contract
rights
was
property
in
this
case.
but
i'd
contend
that
the
only
thing
about
this
case
that
resembles
the
trust
relationship
is
the
relationship
itself.
and
that
relationship
is
recognized
and
was
recognized
at
law
just
as
well
as
it
was
at
equity.
it's...
it's
the
confidential
relationship
between
these
parties.
it's
no
different
from
the
relationship
between
the
director
in
the
corporation
in
ross...
there's
no
difference
between
that
relationship
and
the
relationship
we
have
here.
and
if
the
only
thing
that
resembles
a
trust
is
the
relationship
which
was
also
recognized
at
law,
the
trust
analogy
loses...
loses
its
force,
its
persuasive
force.
that
relationship,
as
this
court
found
in
ross,
could
be
the
focus
of
an
illegal
action.
in
ross
the
case...
the
legal
issues
that
were
found
were
negligence
and
breach
of
contract
by
a
director
who
owed
a
fiduciary
duty
to
his
corporation.
another
issue
was
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
so,
the
union
membership...
the
union
member
relationship
in
this
case
does
not
magically
convert
this
action
to
a
trust
action
any
more
than
the
director's
relationship
did
in
ross.
even
beyond
the
derivative
stockholder
standing
issue,
the
relationship
itself
is
the
same.
going
to
the
second
part
of
the
ross
test,
the
nature
of
relief,
in
this
court's...
it's
clear
that
this
court
has
recognized
on
a
number
of
occasions
that,
generally
speaking,
monetary
relief
is
traditional
legal
relief
because
there
was
an
adequate
remedy
at
law.
and
that's
what
we
have
here
in
dfr
actions.
but
more
importantly,
when
this
court
has
been...
has
decided
cases
involving
statutory
rights
to
a
jury
trial,
the
court
has
looked
at
statutory
intent
on
the
specific
statute
at
issue,
such
as
title
vii
or
the
adea
in
the
lorillard
case.
we
contend
that
in
deciding
the
issue
in
this
case
there
is
no
statutory
intent
because
it's
a
judicial
action.
but
this
court
should
look
at
the
judicial
common
law,
the
federal
common
law
which
has
evolved
over
the
years
in
dfr
actions.
and
that...
the
number
of
decisions
decided
by
this
court
in
the
dfr...
301
dfr
area
indicates
that
this...
that
monetary
damages
is
a
form
of
legal
relief.
even
the
steele
case
said
that.
the
steele
decision,
while
saying
it
was
a
grant
of
power
to
act
on
behalf
of
another...
which
inferred
some
relationship
not
necessarily
trust,
steele
also
said
that
the
full
range
of
judicial
remedies
should
be
available
to
a
victim
of
the
breach
of
duty
of
fair
representation,
including
injunction
and
damages.
the
vaca
court
underscored
that
in
talking
about
the
compensation
principle.
the
faust
court,
while
striking
punitive
damages,
again
emphasized
the
compensation
principle
and
the
very
distinction
between
this
kind
of
action
and
the
action
before
the
nlrb
on
an
unfair
labor
practice.
that
this
type
of
action
that's
involved
is
focused
on
the
individual,
the
private
right
of
the
individual.
and
i
believe
this
court
underscored
that
principle
once
again
in
its
decision
yesterday
in
the
breininger
case,
that
there
are
two
different
types
of
actions,
two
different
sets...
at
least,
to
some
extent,
two
different
sets
of
policies
and
two
different
sets
of
rules
because
one
was
created
or
implied...
or
one
was
recognized
by
the
board
according
to
a
statute
and
the
other
was
recognized
by
this
court
and
implied...
developed
by
this
court.
and
in
the
faust
case
i
think
it
becomes
even
clearer
in
the
concurring
opinion
by
justice
blackmun.
justice
blackmun
stated,
along
with
three
other
members
of
this
court,
that
punitive
damages...
there
should
be
no
per
se
rule
against
punitive
damages
because
steele
recognized
the
full
range
of
judicial
remedies.
and
that
should
include
punitive
damages.
now,
this
court,
as
a
matter
of
federal
labor
policy,
the
majority
decided
to
strike
punitive
damages
at
least
in
that
kind
of
action.
but
the
fact
remains
that
while
limiting
the
range
of
remedies,
this
court
has
always
at
least
implicitly
recognized
that
we're
dealing
with
legal
relief.
and
for
that
reason,
this
case
is
very
distinguishable
from
the
title
vii
case
and
the
cases
under
the
nlra.
the
last
point
i'd
like
to
make
on
the
second
part
of
the
ross
test
is
that
the
other
theories
on
which
back
pay
in
various
types
of
actions
has
been
found
to
be
equitable
relief
has
to
do...
is
whether
it's
restitutionary,
whether
it's
ancillary
to
or
incidental
to
equitable
relief
or
whether
specific
performance.
as
justice
marshall
i
think
stated
in
curtis,
for
the
same
reason
restitution
was
not
an
appropriate
theory
in
that
case,
it's
not
in
this
case.
this...
this...
we're
not
trying
to
discourage
the
company
or
the
union
from
any
kind
of
unjust
enrichment.
we're
not
trying
to
follow
money.
we're
trying
to
seek
compensation
for
what
we've
lost.
in
conclusion,
we
contend
that
these
individuals
who've
alleged
that
their
union
sold
them
out
in
effect,
and
discriminated
against
them
in
favor
of
the
other
members,
have
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
this
case
which
presents
legal
issues
and
monetary
relief.
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
according
to
the
change
of
operations
procedure,
justice
scalia,
our
clients
were
moved
into
winston-salem.
the
company
picked
up
some
of
those
expenses
but
our
client
picked
up
the
rest
of
them
in
moving
their
family
and
reestablishing
themselves
in
a
new
location.
mr.
robert
m.
elliot
well,
that...
that's
correct.
there
is...
there
is
some
inconsistency
there.
we
have
asked
for
those
expenses.
at
this
point...
you
know,
even
in
view
of
the
district
court's
ruling
on
our
other
compensatory
relief,
those
claims
are
still
viable.
thank
you.
