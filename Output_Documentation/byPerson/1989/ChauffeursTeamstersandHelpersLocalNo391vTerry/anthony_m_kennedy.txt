if
the
employer
had
not
been
bankrupt
and
had
still
been
in
the
suit,
would
our
analytic
problem
here
today
be
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
how
it
changes
just
because
the
employer
is
either
here
or
not
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
an
attorney's
duty
is
the
standard
of
care.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
trustee
has
a
similar
duty.
he
really
wears
two
hats.
