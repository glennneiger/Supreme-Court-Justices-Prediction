we'll

argument
next
in

88-1719,
chauffeurs,
teamsters
and
helpers
v.
terry.
mr.
james.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
sort
of
a
remedy
would
the
chancellory
court
give
in
that
situation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
to
prevail
you
really
have
to
show
that
none
of
the
claims
in
the
case
are
triable
by
jury
under
the
seventh
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
really,
this
kind
of
hybrid
action
isn't
based
on
the
national
labor
relations
act
the
same
way
that
the
ada...
the
adea
is.
i
mean,
it
patterned
after
it...
by
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
all
we
held
in
faust
was
that
no
punitive
damages,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
certainly
didn't
find
that
ordinary
damages
would
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
james.
mr.
elliot,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
elliot.
the
case
is
submitted.
