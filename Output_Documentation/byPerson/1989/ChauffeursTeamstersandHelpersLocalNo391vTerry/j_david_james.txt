mr.
j.
david
james
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
a
case
where
an
employee
sues
his
union
alleging
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
whenever
he
seeks
also
some
type
of
monetary
damages,
which
in
this
case
are
the
back
pay.
mr.
j.
david
james
it
certainly
didn't
draw
the
crowd
that
the
first
one
did.
[laughter]
it
is,
however,
important
for
not
only
these
parties,
but
for
the
large
number
of
cases
that
this
raises.
we
contend
that
there
is
no
right
to
a
jury
trial
in
such
a
case,
and
we
do
that
based
upon
the
historical
analysis
that
this
court
has
set
forth
we
should
follow
in
seventh
amendment
questions.
we
have
to
go
to
the
seventh
amendment
because,
like
everybody
agrees,
there
is
no
statutory
right
to
a
jury
trial
and
so
the
question
turns
on
if
there
is
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
it
could
be
found
only
in
the
seventh
amendment.
the
first,
and
this
court
has
set
out
that
that's
a
two-pronged
test,
look
at
the
historical
analog
to
see
if
this
is
more
like
an
equitable
or
a
legal
action,
and
then
turn
to
the
more
important
issue,
what
are
the
types
of
remedies
asked
for
in
the
case,
the
nature
of
those
remedies
and
are
they
more
legal
or
equitable
in
nature.
we
say,
turning
to
the
first
prong,
that
this,
while
not
recognized
in...
at
the
time
the
constitution
and
the
seventh
amendment
was
enacted...
the
duty
of
fair
representation
action
was
not
recognized
then...
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
action
does
have
its
origin
in
the
traditions
of
equities
law
trust.
and
we
have
discussed
that
our
brief...
in
our
briefs
at
some
length,
how
the
union
in
a
duty
of
fair
representation
case
is
much
like
a
trustee
situation
that
was
found
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
seventh
amendment.
a
union,
like
a
trustee,
is
given
discretionary
power
to
be
exercised
for
the
benefit
of
certain
employees.
in
steele
v.
l&n
railroad,
this
court
recognized
that
the
union,
like
a
trustee,
must
act
on
behalf
of
these
employees
non-arbitrarily,
must
act
in
good
faith.
the
relationship
that
we
find
between
a
union
and
the
employees
that
it
represents
is
very
much
like
that
between
a
trustee
and
beneficiaries
that
it
represents.
the
union
has
broad
discretion,
just
like
a
trustee
has
broad
discretion.
the
trustee,
or
a
union,
can
represent
employees
or
beneficiaries
with
divergent,
even
conflicting
interests.
that's
unlike
the
lawyer/client
relationship
where
the
client
controls
and
tells
the
lawyer
what
he
has
to
do
and
can
withdraw,
have
other
counsel,
if
he
does
not
like
what
the
attorney
is
doing.
with
a
union,
an
employee
cannot
insist
that
the
union
take
any
specific
action.
it...
the
union,
like
a
trustee...
has
discretion
to
decide
itself
what
to
do.
and
as
long
as
it
stays
within
the
certain
bounds
allowed
by
the
courts
in
that
discretion,
the
employee
cannot
force
the
union,
just
like
a
beneficiary
could
not
force
a
trustee
to
take
any
particular
action.
thus,
we
say
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
action
is
very
similar
to
the
trust
action
which
was
found
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
seventh
amendment,
and
it's
clear
that
those
trust
actions
were
developed
solely
in
equity,
that
they
were
not
recognized
in
law
courts.
and
we
say
that,
therefore,
if
you
look
at
the
nature
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
action,
it
is
most
like
that
trust
analogy
and
it's
thus
equitable.
that's
particular
seen
in
the
sort
of
hybrid
action
that
we
have
here
where
a
union
is
sued
by
an
employee
who
claims
that
the
union
did
not
take
some
action
properly
and
at
the
same
time
the
employee
claims
the
company
that
it...
is
its
employer
also
acted
improperly.
that
is
very
similar
to
the
old
trust
actions
where
a...
an...
a
beneficiary
of
a
trust
would
say
the
trustee
should
have
taken
some
action
against
a
third
party
but...
and
it
was
an
abuse
of
its
discretion,
the
trustee's
discretion,
not
to
take
that
action.
and,
therefore,
in
equity
courts...
not
in
law
courts,
could
not
do
it
there...
but
in
equity
courts
the
beneficiary
would
go
in
and
say
to
the
court,
the
trustee
has
acted
improperly
in
not
taking
this
action
against
the
third
party,
and
the
third
party
has
acted
improperly.
give
me
a
remedy
against
them.
that
is
something
that
it
is
clear
could
not
be
done
in
law
courts.
mr.
j.
david
james
in
that
situation
it
was
not
unusual
for
the
equity
court
to
give
money
damages
as
a
remedy.
it
was...
they
could
give
the
traditional
equitable
remedies
also,
but
they
also
gave
money
damages
against
a
trustee.
and
we've
cited
some
cases
and
cited
some
authorities
about
that
so
that
if
actions
of
the
third
party
were
harmful
to
the
beneficiary,
caused
it
to
lose
some
money,
and
because
of
running
the
statute
of
limitations
or
some
reason
that
money
could
not
be
recovered
from
the
third
party,
it
could
be
recovered
from
the
trustee.
or,
it
could
be
recovered
from
both.
but,
in
any
case,
it
was
a
money
damage
recoverable
in
equity.
mr.
j.
david
james
no,
they
don't...
you
don't...
if
the
beneficiary
in
that
situation
wanted
to...
thought
that
the
trustee
had
not
acted
properly,
he
couldn't
go
to
the
law
court.
he
couldn't--
mr.
j.
david
james
--there
are
cases
where
the
trust
would
have
a
remedy
at
law,
yes.
mr.
j.
david
james
it's
not
like
a
derivative
suit.
mr.
j.
david
james
let
me
tell
you
why
i
think
it's
not
the
same.
mr.
j.
david
james
is
that
in
those
shareholder
derivative
suits
you
had
basically
the
shareholder
standing
in
the
shoes
of
the
corporation
asserting
the
corporation's
claim.
here,
this
is
not
a
claim
of
the
trustee.
these
are
rights
that
the
beneficiary
claims
it
has.
if...
if
there
is
a
recovery,
it
doesn't
go
to
the
corporation,
like
in
the
shareholder's
derivative
action.
it
goes
directly
to
the
beneficiary.
and
in
those
shareholder
derivative
actions,
they
came
about,
as
this
court
explained
in
ross
v.
bernhard,
because
of
procedural
problems
that
they
could
not
be
brought
in
the
law
court.
and
so...
but
that
procedural
problem
is
not
here.
the
law
courts
didn't
recognize
the
beneficiaries'
rights
at
all.
mr.
j.
david
james
but
he
doesn't
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
union
the
way
he
does
in
a
shareholder's
derivative
suit,
because
in
a
shareholder's
derivative
suit
he
stands
in
the
shoes
and
he
recovers
a
benefit
for
the
corporation.
here,
he
doesn't
stand
in
their
shoes.
he
recovers
a
benefit
for
himself
and
in
fact
can
recover
it
directly
from
the
union.
in
a
shareholder's
derivative
suit--
mr.
j.
david
james
--he
wasn't
getting
it
from
the
corporation.
that's
why
i
think
they
are
different.
and
because
the
shareholder's
derivative
suit
was
this
procedural
device
used
by
the
equity
courts
to
get
to
it...
that's
not
a
procedural
device
here.
this
is
just
a
pure
equity
claim
against...
against...
like
the
equity
claim
like
against
the
trustee.
mr.
j.
david
james
well,
i
don't
think
we're
talking
about
smart
money.
that
goes
to
the
second
prong
of
the
test
dealing
with
what
remedy
is
available.
i
think
in
this
case
that
it
is
not
a
fixed
set
sum
that
is
sought.
it
is
a
sum
that
the
court
in
its
discretion
can
decide
how
much
or
how
little
to
give.
mr.
j.
david
james
well,
i
think--
mr.
j.
david
james
--well,
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the...
the
duty
of
fair
representation
actions,
they
talk
in
terms
that
you
are
to
get
only
a
make
whole
relief.
you
are
not
to
get
something
beyond
what
would
make
that
employee
whole.
you
are
not
to
recover...
for
instance,
in
faust
you
do
not
recover
punitive
damages.
mr.
j.
david
james
i
would
say
that
it
does
not.
this
court
has
not
specifically
passed
on
that
issue,
but
i
would
say
that
it
does
not
include
those.
mr.
j.
david
james
and
it
may
include
some
additional
damages
for
legal
fees
and
things
like
that
to
make
him
whole.
what
he
had
to
spend
to
get
to...
to
get
to
that
position.
that's
what
i'm
talking
about...
about
make
whole
relief.
the
respondents
argue
that
beacon
theatres
and
dairy
queen
and
ross
v.
bernhard
do
say
that
these
are
legal
issues,
ultimate
legal
issues
and
that,
therefore,
this
is
a
legal
case.
i'd
say
that
those
cases
do
not
say
that.
they
say
that
if
there
are
purely
legal
claims
that
are
being
raised,
then
you
cannot
be
denied
your
right
to
jury
trial.
but
we're--
mr.
j.
david
james
--i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
they
are
legal
claims
triable
to
a
jury,
then...
that
those
would...
there
would
be
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
under
the
seventh
amendment
for
those.
but
we
assert
they
are
not,
these
legal
claims.
of
course,
there's
the
two
prongs.
the
first
prong
would
be
not
as
important
as
the
remedy
section,
but
we
think
that
under
that
first
prong
that
these
claims
are
purely
equitable
claims.
they
were
recognized
only
in
the
equity
courts
and
not
legal
claims
at
all.
there
are
some
factual
inquiries
that
are
found
both
in
legal
courts
and
equitable
courts.
but
when
this
issue
is
raised
in
the
equitable
court,
the
equitable
court
passed
on
those
factual
inquiries
as
the...
factor...
finders
of
fact.
and
it
was
because
the
claim
was
purely
an
equitable
claim
that
it
had
to
do
that.
therefore,
because
we
think
those
are
purely
equitable
issues,
we
do
believe
that
the
first
prong
of
the
test,
that
the
nature
of
the
claim
shows
that
there
is
no
right
to
a
jury
trial.
which
leads
us,
then,
to
the
second
prong
of
the
test
which,
of
course,
this
court
has
said
is
the
more
important,
which
is
the
nature
of
the
remedies.
the
only
remedy
sought
here,
which
the
plaintiffs
claim
is
legal
rather
than
equitable,
is
the
back
pay
remedy.
there
was
a
claim
made
for
punitive
damages,
emotional
distress
damages,
but
that
was
dismissed
by
the
trial
court.
those
claims
are
not
in
this...
found
that
those
were
not
appropriate
in
duty
of
fair
representation
cases,
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
courts.
mr.
j.
david
james
that's
correct.
i
don't
think
the
issues
are--
mr.
j.
david
james
--are
any
different
in
that
situation.
mr.
j.
david
james
no
jury
trial
there
either.
mr.
j.
david
james
you
have
to
show
the
same
breach
of
duty
in
that
case
that
you
do
if
you're
suing
the
union.
the
issues
are
identical
in
both
cases.
mr.
j.
david
james
i
believe
he
can.
mr.
j.
david
james
no.
that...
that
is
not
my
understanding.
if
he
is
a
beneficiary
and
he
is
suing
claiming
that
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
trustee
and
this
third
party
and
the
trustee
isn't
doing
what
he
wants,
he
cannot
go
into
the
law
courts
and
bring
that.
he
could
only
go
into
the
equity
courts
and
bring
that
action.
that's
my
understanding
as
it
was
back--
mr.
j.
david
james
--yes,
i
believe
it
does.
i
believe
since
the
issues
that
he
would
have
to
prove
in
both
the
suit
against
the
company
or
against
the
union,
or
both,
are
the
same,
then
the
same
rules
would
apply
across
the
board.
the
plain...
the
respondents
in
this
case
argue
that
the
back
pay
is
always
legal.
that
is,
upon
a
proof
of
a
breach
of
the
duty
that
there
is
an
automatic
and
mandatory
requirement
that
they
receive
this
back
pay.
we
say
that
that's
just
not
true,
that
there
is
a
discretionary
element.
when
they
cite
in
their
brief
a
quote
that
generally
at
equity,
money
judgments
were
allowed
only
when
ancillary
to
traditional
equity
relief,
we
say,
while
that's
generally
true,
it's
not
always
true,
and
we've
given
you
the
specific
example
in
the
trust
situation
where
money
damages
were
recovered.
and
that
was
recognized
by
this
court,
i
think,
in
curtis
v.
loether
where
it
says
that
just
because
it's
monetary
damages
you
don't
say
that
that
always
makes
it
legal
relief.
so
you
have
to
look
beyond
the
fact
that
it's
money
damages
and
look
at
those
money
damages
and
the
nature
of
those
damages
to
make
this
determination.
and
on
that
the
issue
is,
is
there
discretion
in
awarding
these
monetary
damages
or
is
there
not?
if
there's
no
discretion,
then
it's
a
legal
type
relief.
if
there
is
discretion,
it's
equitable.
i
think
the
respondents
in
their
brief
concede
that
that's
the
line,
that
that's
the
test
to
be
followed.
and
if
you
follow
that
test,
you
find
that
these...
there
is
this
discretionary
element
and
thus
these
are
equitable
type
remedies.
i
think
that
most
clearly
can
be
seen
by
comparing
the
duty
of
fair
representation
remedies
with
those
found...
found
in
title
vii.
when
you
find
title
vii,
you
find
that
those
remedies
are
based
upon
the
nlra,
the
national
labor
relations
act,
that
there
is
a
discretionary
element
in
this
damages.
this
court
has
held
that
there
is
that
discretionary
element.
mr.
j.
david
james
in
this
particular
kind
of
duty
of
fair
representation
case
you
certainly
do
have
to
prove
that
the
employer--
mr.
j.
david
james
--had
breached
the
contract.
mr.
j.
david
james
relief.
mr.
j.
david
james
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
david
james
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
david
james
my
understanding
of
the
breach--
mr.
j.
david
james
--well,
my
reading
of
the
cases
says
that
you
have
to
prove
both
of
those
things
in
this
sort
of
situation
before--
mr.
j.
david
james
--you
could
recover.
mr.
j.
david
james
relief.
mr.
j.
david
james
that's
correct.
back,
just
a
minute,
to
the
title
vii
where
this
court
has
held
that
those
title
vii
remedies
are
discretionary
because
they're
based
on
the
nlra,
and
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
remedies
are
discretionary.
in
phelps
dodge,
this
court
has
said
that
they're
not
to
be
mechanically
complied
with,
but
are
entrusted
to
the
discretion
of
the
nlrb.
likewise,
the
duty
of
fair
representation
remedies
are
derived
from
the
national
labor
relations
act.
this
court
has
held
that
the
remedies
in
duty
of
fair
representation
cases
must
effectuate
the
policies
under
the
labor
act,
just
like
in
title
vii.
the
remedies
in
title
vii
are
make
whole
remedies.
that's
what
you
talked
about
in
albermarle
paper.
here
they're
make
whole
remedies.
mr.
j.
david
james
well,
you
talk
in
faust,
though,
that
the
remedial
policy...
the
remedies
given
under...
for
duty
of
fair
representation
breaches...
must
effectuate
the
policies
espoused
by
the
act.
and
i
think
that
that,
sort
of
by
implication,
does
the
same
thing
you
found
in
title
vii.
mr.
j.
david
james
yes,
but
in
getting
to
that
position
you
did
talk
about
how
the
remedial
policies...
remedies
available
for
dfr,
duty
of
fair
representation
cases,
must
be
such
that
effectuate
the
policies
underlying
the
act.
and
you
found
that
punitive
damages
did
not
effectuate
those
policies
in
that
case.
mr.
j.
david
james
it
wasn't
presented
in
that
case.
no,
judge,
it
has
not.
the--
mr.
j.
david
james
--well,
there's
a...
there's
a
case
cited
in
our
brief
called
navigation...
american
navigation,
or
something
like
that.
it's
an
nlrb
case.
and
in
that
case,
they
found
that
the
employer
had
violated...
had
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
but
did
not
award
back
pay
remedies
to
the
employee
because
the
employee
in
the
midst
of
the
compliance
proceedings
had
lied,
had
said,
well,
we
didn't
work
here
or
did
work
here.
had
lied
about
what
money
it
had
earned.
and
so
the
board
said,
we're
going
to
exercise
our
discretion.
we're
going
to
deny
you
back
pay
relief
in
that
situation.
mr.
j.
david
james
i
believe
that's
true.
if
you
look
at
our
brief,
we
talk
at
length
about
how
the
parties
in
these
agreements
really
negotiate
for
a
decision
by
an
arbitrator
and
give
an
arbitrator
wide
discretion
as
to
what
relief
is
given.
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
for
an
employee
who
is
discharged
to
go
to
arbitration
and
be
found
that
the
company
has
improperly
discharged
it.
but
then
be
placed
back
at
work
without
back
pay.
it
is
not
at
all
unusual
to
have
that
sort
of
remedy
come
in
an
arbitration
proceeding.
if
the
idea
is
to
make
whole
the
employee,
not
give
him
a
windfall,
then
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
what
were
the
possible
remedies
he
could
get
in
an
arbitrator's
decision
but
for
this
dfr
breach.
and
if
that's
true,
then
there
is
this
wide
range
of
discretion
given
to
arbitrators
that
i
think
carries
over
into
the
dfr
area
as
well.
and
because
you
have
that
wide
range
of
discretion
which
is
applicable
not
only
to
the
arbitrator's
decision,
not
only
applicable
for
the
board,
but
also
by
the
courts
in
the
duty
of
fair
representation
area,
the
remedy,
the
nature
of
the
remedy,
is
an
equitable
remedy
and
not
a
legal
remedy.
when
you
take
that
prong,
the
stronger
of
the
two
prongs,
and
it
clearly
says
that
the
remedies
are
equitable,
and
attach
it
to
the
first
prong
which
says
that
the
nature
of
the
action
was
basically
an
equitable...
like
an
equitable...
not
exactly
the
same,
but
like
the
old
trust
action...
then
i
conclude
that
the
action
here,
the
duty
of
fair
representation
action
in
this
sort
of
hybrid
situation,
is
an
equitable
action,
does
not
call
for
a
jury
trial
under
the
seventh
amendment,
and
that
the
district
court
was
incorrect
below
when
they
denied
our
motion
to
strike
their
jury
trial
demand.
mr.
j.
david
james
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
there
often
have
been
jury
trials
in
these
areas
in
the
past.
mr.
j.
david
james
and,
as
you
would
see
from
the
cases
cited,
it's
slowly
building
through
the
circuit.
some
say
yes,
some
say
no.
mr.
j.
david
james
that's
right.
mr.
j.
david
james
if
you
have
no
further
questions,
i'll
just
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
thank
you.
mr.
j.
david
james
we
did
not
seek
to
have
that
claim
for
moving
expenses
struck
at
the
same
time
we
did
emotional
distress
damages
and
punitive
damages.
in
hindsight,
we
should
have.
it
was
just
one
of
those
things.
we
never
could
understand
that
claim,
and
we
always
thought
it
was
inconsistent.
they
never
said
it
once
before,
and
so
we
didn't
make
that
motion
at
that
time.
but
i
think
he's
right,
it
is
inconsistent.
i've
never
understood.
there's
no
contract
breach
about
that.
they
got
what
the
contract
was...
required
about
the
moving
expenses,
and
so
i've
always
ignored
that
in
this
case.
i
do
want
to
say
that
we
think
that
the
trust
analogy
is
much
more
apt
than
the
legal
malpractice
analogy
principally
because
of
the
discretion
given
the
union
to
act
on
behalf
of
these
employees.
an
attorney
does
not
have
that
discretion.
it...
an
attorney
cannot
represent
conflicting
views.
a
union
does
do
that
all
the
time
and
so
did
a
trustee
who
had
beneficiaries
with
conflicting
interests,
directly
conflicting.
and
that's
why
we
say
that
the
trust
analogy
is
more
apt
in
this
case
than
is
that
legal
malpractice
action.
in
fact,
a
union
doesn't
have
any
duty
to
file
the
grievance.
if
it
files
it,
it
doesn't
have
to
take
it
to
arbitration.
it
can
even
refuse
to
take
something
to
arbitration
because
it's
too
costly
if
in
its
exercise
of
discretion
yet
in
good
faith
determines
that
for
the
best
interests
of
everyone
in
that
group
this
grievance
should
not
be
taken
to
arbitration.
an
attorney
doesn't
have
that.
he
can't
make
that
choice.
he's
specifically
prohibited
from
making
that--
mr.
j.
david
james
--that's
correct.
mr.
j.
david
james
the
trustee's
duty
is
somewhat
different
than...
than
the...
than
the
attorney's.
i've
seen
someplace...
some
people
call
it
the
standard
of
conduct
rather
than
the
standard
of
care.
that
doesn't
help
me
a
whole
lot
to
understand
the
difference.
but
with
a
trustee
and
with
a
union,
they
have
this
discretion...
discretion
of
whether
they
should
bring
this
claim
or
not.
if
a
client
comes
to
an
attorney
and
employs
and
attorney
and
says,
i
want
you
to
bring
this
claim,
and
the
attorney
just
doesn't,
well,
he
breaches
his
standard
of
care.
he
can't
make
that
decision.
the
union
can
make
that
decision.
the
trustee
can
make
that
decision.
that's
why
we
think
that
analogy
is
more
apt.
it's
also...
the
rights
of
the
employee
in
this
case
are
not
equal
to
simple
contract
rights
against
the
employer.
the
employee
must
rely
upon
the
union,
like
a
beneficiary
must
rely
upon
the
trustee.
and
the
rights
the
employees
have
are
like
the
rights
beneficiaries
have.
that
is,
they
come
from
this
trust
relationship.
all
of
that
leads
us
to
conclude
that
this
is
more
analogous
to
the
trust
situation.
finally,
just
one
point.
in
talking
about
whether
the...
he
mentioned
in
ross
how
there
was
a
claim
of
a
breach
of
fiduciary
duty
there.
this
court
specifically
reserved
the
question
and
did
not
say
that...
whether
that
had
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
that
issue
or
not.
the
only
issues
in
ross
that
it
found
it...
was
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
were
the
clearly
legal
issues.
and
as
we've
said,
these
are
not
those
clearly
legal
issues.
thank
you
very
much.
