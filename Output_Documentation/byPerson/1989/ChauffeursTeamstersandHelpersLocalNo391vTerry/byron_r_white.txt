xxx
suit
solely
against
the
employer?
suppose
there
was
a
breach
of
duty
by
the
union
and
the
employee
thinks
that
the
employer
breached
the
contract
but
i
don't
want
to
sue
the
union,
i'm
just
going
to
sue
the
employer.
and
if
he
can
prove
a
breach
of
duty
by
the
union,
the
employer
must
respond.
justice
byron
r.
white
then...
then--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
you
think
that
no
jury
trial
then
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
of
the...
because
you
have
to
prove
a
breach
of
trust
first?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i...
i
thought
in
trust
law
that
if
the...
if
the...
if
the
beneficiary
thinks
the
trustee
hasn't
acted
properly
and
hasn't
collected
something
from
some
third
party
he
asks
the
trustee
to
sue
and
the
trustee
doesn't...
says
no,
and
he
goes
and
sues
the
third
party
directly.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
he
gets
a
jury
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
the
same
thing
applies
here,
therefore,
even
if
he
sued
the
employer
alone?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
in
a
suit
against
the
union
alone
to
prove
a
breach
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
the
employer
breached
a
contract.
you
just
have
to
prove
that
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
yeah,
you're--
justice
byron
r.
white
--going
to
have
to
prove...
you're
going
to
have
to
prove
the
employer
breached
it
in
order
to
get...
to
get
any--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
get
the
damages...
to
get
back
pay--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
can
prove
the
duty,
breach
of
the
duty,
without
proving
the
breach
by
the
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
if...
but
if
it's...
but
if
it's
a...
if
it's
a
case
that
should
be
then
taken
to
arbitration,
the
union...
and
the
union
doesn't
take
it,
the
union's
breached
its
duty,
whether
you...
whether
it
turns
out
that
an
arbitrator
would
have
held
for
the
employee
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
can--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
you're
going
to
have
to
prove
the
breach
by
the
employer
to
get--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
get
the
kind
of
relief
you
want.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
much
are
you
going
to
ask
for?
how
are
you
going
to
measure
your
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
back
pay.
essentially
back
pay.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
no...
no
other
damages
and
no
punitive
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
this
got
to
do
with
the
issue
we've
got
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
the
employer
was
entitled,
under
his
contract,
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
the
employer
was
entitled
to
rely
on
the
decision
of
the
arbitrator
or
the
arbitrating...
whoever
it
was
that
decided
the
grievance...
unless
the
union
breached
its
duty.
and
if
the
union
breached
its
duty,
then
the
employer
could
not
rely
on
his...
could
not
rely
on
the
board's
decision.
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
you
say
that
that
a...
if
you're
going
to
set
aside
a
contract,
isn't
that
sort
of
an
equitable
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
yeah.
i
know.
but
the
employer...
to
stick
the
employer,
you've
got
to
prove
a
breach
by
the
union
and
you
say
that...
that
the
union's
duty
is...
should
not
be
analogized
at
all
to
a
trust
operation,
to
a
trustee.
it
should
be
analogized
to
a...
to
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
a
lawyer.
