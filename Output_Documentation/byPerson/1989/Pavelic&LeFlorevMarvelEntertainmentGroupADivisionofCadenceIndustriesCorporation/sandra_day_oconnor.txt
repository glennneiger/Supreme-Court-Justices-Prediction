justice
o'connor
well,
aren't
most
pleadings
signed
smith
&
jones
law
firm
by
so-and-so
attorney?
justice
o'connor
and
you
don't
think
that
the
attorney
represents
thereby
that
he
represents,
or
she
represents,
that
law
firm
and
is
authorized
to
sign
it
on
behalf,
not
only
of
the
attorney,
but
for
the
firm?
justice
o'connor
so
the
rule
could
be
interpreted,
if
you
followed
ordinary
agency
principles,
i
suppose,
to
bring
the
firm
in
as
well.
justice
o'connor
--well,
i
thought
he
suggested
there
could
be,
but
under
the
inherent
authority
of
the
court,
just
not
under
the
terms
of
rule
11
as
it
is
presently
written.
