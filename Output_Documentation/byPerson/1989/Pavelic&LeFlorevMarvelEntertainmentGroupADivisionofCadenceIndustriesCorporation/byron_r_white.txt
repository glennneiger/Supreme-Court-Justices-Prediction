well,
this
sanction
was
imposed
under
rule
11,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
and
rule
11
requires
that
a...
an
individual
sign.
justice
white
and
it
says
that
the
court
may
impose
a
sanction
on
the
person
who
signed
it.
justice
white
could,
could
i
ask...
let's
assume
we
agree
with
you,
and
the
sanction
is
limited
to
being
imposed
on
the
person
who
signed
the...
under
state
law
could
the
sanction
be
collected
from
the
partnership?
justice
white
because
of
the
rule
or
because
of
state
law?
do
you
think
the
rule
would
say
that
it,
that
it
preempts
the
liability
of
the
partnership
for
the
obligations
of
one
of
its
partners?
justice
white
oh
no,
you
can't
go
against
the...
let's
just
assume
the
individual
partner
who
is
sanctioned
is
just...
is
just
judgment
proof,
which
is
true,
i
suppose,
of
some
attorneys.
[laughter]
and...
but
then
the...
then
the
resort
is
to
the
partnership.
justice
white
under
ordinary
state
law,
the
partnership
would
be
liable
for
an
obligation
of
its
limited
partners
incurred
in
the
course
of
the
partnership
business.
