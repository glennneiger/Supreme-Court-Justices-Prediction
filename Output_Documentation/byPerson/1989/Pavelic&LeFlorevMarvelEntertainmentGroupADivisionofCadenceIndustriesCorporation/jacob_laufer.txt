mr.
jacob
laufer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
a
petition
of
certiorari
through
a
view
of
decision
of
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
interpretation
of
rule
11
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
more,
specifically,
whether
under
rule
11
a
district
court
is
empowered
to
impose
sanctions
not
only
upon
the
attorney
who
signs
a
paper
or
pleading
that
offends
the
rule,
but
the
district
court...
whether
the
district
court
may
also
impose
sanctions
upon
the
law
firm
or
law
partnership
or
employer
of
such
an
attorney
who
has
signed
such
a
pleading.
now,
the
context
in
which
this
has
arisen
is
a
case
in
which,
after
trial,
the
district
court
imposed
significant
monetary
sanctions.
the
sanctions
were
predicated
upon
a
factual
claim.
that
factual
claim
is
referred
throughout
as
the
facsimile
claim.
that
claim
appeared
very
early
in
the
litigation
in
the
amended
complaint.
it
was
used...
it
was
used
at,
at
another
point
in
the
litigation
to
defeat
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
the
respondents
had
filed,
and
that
claim
was
ultimately
abandoned
and
withdrawn
immediately
prior
to
the
trial.
the
district
court
found
that
while
that
claim
had
not
been
interposed
in
bad
faith,
that
claim
had
not
been
researched
adequately
in
terms
of
its
factual
foundation
by
the
attorney,
and
accordingly
determined
that
sanctions
were
appropriate.
the
district
court,
in
terms
of
the
attorney
sanctions,
created
basically
two
categories
of
attorney
sanction.
the
first
attorney
sanction
was
against
the
signer
himself,
and
that
was
for
the
first
half,
this
is
after...
finally
after
a
hearing
on...
or
an
argument
under
rule
60(b).
the
court
found
that
during
the
first
half
of
the
litigation,
the
signer
basically
stood
alone,
and,
and
imposed
those
sanctions
against
him.
the
court
found
that
thereafter,
during
the
approximate
midpoint
of
the
litigation,
the
signer
of
the
pleading
had
formed
a
firm,
which
is
now
the
petitioner
before
this
court
of
pavelic
&
leflore,
and
according...
accordingly
apportioned
half
of
the
sanctions,
the
latter
half
of
the
sanctions,
against
both
&
leflore.
the
issue
came
up
before
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
and
that
court
determined,
based
upon
its
view
of
the
purpose
of
rule
11,
that
it
was
appropriate
that
sanctions
could
be
imposed
by
the
district
court,
presumptively
it,
it
indicated,
because
that
would,
in
the
view
of
the
second
circuit
court
of
appeals,
promote
the
purpose
of
rule
11
in
the
sense,
the
court
felt,
that
law
firms
and
employers
would
be
motivated
by
this
presumption
that
the
second
circuit
was
creating
to
monitor
more,
more
specifically
and
with,
with
greater
vigor
the
pleadings
that
were
signed
by
all
of
its
attorneys.
and
accordingly,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
created
this
rule,
which
we
submit
is
without
textural
foundation.
we
claim
that
the
district
court
did
not
have
the
power
under
this
case
to
impose
sanctions
upon
pavelic
&
leflore,
upon
the
petitioner.
in
order
to
reach
that
conclusion,
your
honors,
we
go
first
and
principally
to
the
words
of
rule
11.
the
words
of
rule
11
indicate,
first,
that
insofar
as
attorneys
are
concerned
in
the
case
of
represented
parties,
a,
a
pleading
or
any
paper
that
is
to
be
considered
by
a
district
court
must
be
signed
by
at
least
one
attorney
of
record
in
his
individual
name,
and
that
attorney
must
give
his
address.
and
it
go...
goes
on
from
there.
but
the,
the,
the
rule
itself
specifically
requires
that
an
attorney
who
signs
the
pleading
sign
in
his
individual
name.
incidentally,
your
honors,
this
has
been
the
course
of
rule
11
since
the
very
inception
of
rule
11,
when
it
was
first
promulgated
in
1938.
there
was
a
very
early
district
court
decision
in
which
there
was
a
united
states
against
american
surety,
where
a,
a
signature
appeared,
a,
a
firm
of
attorneys
by
so
and
so,
a
member
of
the
firm,
and
there
was
actually
a
motion
to
strike
that
motion.
and
the
district
court,
in,
in
reading
rule
11
back
50
years
ago,
said
we
know
this,
this
is
a
signature
of
an
individual
attorney,
we
know
who
this
attorney
is,
he
is
front
and
center
before
us
and
he
is
strictly
responsible,
and
he
has
therefore
complied
with
rule
11
as
it
was
then
created
and
as
it
now
exists,
i
would
submit,
your
honors.
following
this
requirement
within
the
rule,
that
an
attorney
in
his
individual
name
sign
such
a
pleading,
the,
the
rule
explains
what
that
signature
means.
that
rule
is
a
certificate,
a
certificate
being
a
written
assurance,
a
written
representation
by
the
signer
of
the
pleading,
that
the
signer
has
read
the
pleading,
that
the
signer
warrants
that
the
pleading
meets
the
factual
and
legal
requirements
that
are
set
out
in
the
rule,
meaning
a
factual,
a
factual
inquiry
that
is
reasonable
under
all
of
the
circumstances,
a
legal
inquiry
that
is
reasonable
under
all
of
the
circumstances.
the
signer
further
warrants
that
the,
the
pleading
is
not
interposed
for
any
improper
purpose
and
some
of
those
purposes,
improper
purposes,
are
articulated
within
the
rule.
and
then
we
come
to
the
operative
language
of
the
rule
itself,
and
the
operative
language
of
the
rule
says
that
upon
finding
a
violation,
if
a
violation
is
found,
the
district
court
shall
impose
upon
the
person
who
signed
it,
that
is
the
person,
the
attorney
of
record
in
his
individual
name
who
has
signed
it,
who
has
given
his
address--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--i
assume
that
that
is
implicit.
the,
the
signer
has,
is
retained
by
a
client.
the
signer
is
retained
by
a
client--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--implicitly,
i
believe
he
does,
in
the
sense
that
anytime
someone
uses--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--well,
your
honor,
the
rule
rejects
a
firm's
name.
the
rule
rejects
a
firm's
name.
the
rule
does
not
permit
the
signing
of
a
pleading
in
the
name
smith
&
jones,
being
the
name
of
a
law
partnership.
the
rule
requires
that
an
individual
person
sign
it.
the
rule--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--they
are
indeed.
mr.
jacob
laufer
that
is
surely
implicit
within
an
attorney's
signature
that,
that...
that
indicates
that
that
attorney
is--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
is
not
so,
because
i
believe,
first,
we
have
the
language
of
the
rule.
an
attorney
of
record,
at
least
one
of
attorney
of
record,
in
his
individual
name,
in
that
attorney's
individual
name.
we
come
to
the
antecedent
of
the
rule.
we
see
how
we
come
by
this
rule.
the
antecedent
of
this
rule
is
rule
11
of
1938.
and
rule
11
of
1938
did
not
encompass
an
attorney
and
a
party
the
way
this
rule
structurally
and
grammatically
must
encompass.
it
encompassed
an
attorney.
and
it
indicated
that
the
attorney
warranted
that
he
read
it,
that
he
was,
was,
was
satisfied
and
was
making
the
certification
to
the
court.
the
advisory
committee's
notes
indicate
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
advisory
committee
that,
that
the
rule
continue
in
its
application
to
anyone
who
signs
a
pleading.
the
test
that
the
district
courts
are
exhorted
by
the
advisory
committee
notes
to,
to
use
in
ascertaining
whether
the
tests
of
the
rule
have
been
met
deal
with
the
signer's
conduct,
the
attorney
who
signed
it,
the
person
who
signed
it.
i
believe
that
while
it
is
indeed
true
that
the
law
firm
is
or
are
the
attorneys
for
a
particular
party,
that
is
without
question,
but
for
purposes
of
the
rule,
that
person
who
was
called
to
task,
who
makes
a
written
assurance
to
the
court,
a,
a,
a
representation
to
the
court
for
which
that
person
is
sanctioned
or
punished,
is
one
particular
person.
there
are
references
in
the
advisory
committee
notes
to
other
attorneys,
but
the
only
such
reference
has
to
do
with
testing
the
signer's
conduct,
meaning
whether
or
not
the
signer...
what
the
signer
did
was
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
may
depend
on
whether
that
signed
relied
upon
another
member
of
the
bar.
so
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
rule
does
not...
does
not
give,
give,
give
latitude
to
be
interpreted,
i
would
submit,
that
the
signature
of
the
signer
in
his
individual
name
is
the
signature
of
a
law
firm.
i,
i
could
not
understand
the
rule
under
other
circumstances.
and
frankly,
if
i
might
suggest,
your
honor,
that
that
is
not
terribly
distinct
perhaps
even
from
the
rule
of
this
court,
rule
33.2,
which,
which
requires
that
the
counsel
of
record
before
this
court
be
an
individual
member
of
the
bar
of
this
court,
and
that
a,
a,
a
law
firm
may
not
be
the
counsel
of
record.
now
the
law
firm
are
the
attorneys,
without
question.
many
such
lawyers
who
are
counsel
of
record
before
this
court
are
members
of,
of
law
firms.
but
the
law
firm
is
not
the
counsel
of
record,
nor,
i,
i,
i
submit,
is
the
law
firm
the
attorney
of
record,
as
contemplated
by
the
plain
language
of
rule
11.
as
i
have
indicated,
the
structure
of
rule
11,
the
grammar
of
rule
11,
all
militate
very
strongly
in
favor
of
this
interpretation,
and
indeed
i
would
submit
they
militate
conclusively
in
favor
of
this
interpretation
that
i
am
urging
upon
this
court.
confirmation,
of
course,
is,
is
found
i
believe
if
we
go
beyond
the
actual
language
of
the
rule
itself,
if
we
go
to
the
advisory
committee
notes.
again,
the
entire
focus
is
riveted,
it's
purely
riveted
to
an
individual
attorney,
who
makes
a
promise
to
the
court
and
who
is
held
accountable.
under
the
earlier
version
of
the
rule,
under
rule
11
of
1938,
the
accountability
was
in
terms
purely
of
a
disciplinary
action.
and
as
the
advisory
committee
notes
indicate,
there
was
some
reluctance
on
the
part
of
courts
to,
to,
to
use
disciplinary
action.
there
was
confusion
regarding
the
circumstances
that
might
trigger
it,
and,
and,
and,
and
as
well--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--no,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
district
court
would
most
surely
not
be
powerless.
i
think
those
two
attorneys,
those
two
hypothetical
partners
that
your
honor
has,
has
referred
to,
would
be
shocked
to
learn
that
the
district
court's
arm
reaches
far
beyond
rule
11,
that
conduct
of
that
sort
would
be
clearly,
under
any
set
of
circumstances,
bad-faith
conduct,
and
the
district
court
can
surely
discipline--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--under
its
inherent...
under
its
inherent
powers,
as
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
roadway
express
case
and
a
whole
series
of
other
cases.
rule
11
does
not
signify
the
outer
boundaries
of
the
reach
and
power
of
the
district
court
to
deal
with
abuses
and
to
deal
with...
to
deal
with
bad
faith
conduct
or
wrong
conduct
that
is
directed
at
a
district
court--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--there
was
no
bad
faith
here,
justice
stevens.
mr.
jacob
laufer
justice
stevens,
in,
in
the
roadway
express
case,
in
my
reading
of
it,
i
believe
it
is
clear,
at
least
to
me,
from
the
language
of,
of
this
court,
that
before
a
court
can,
can
invoke
its
inherent
authorities
to
sanction,
to
sanction
an
attorney,
there
must
be
a
finding
of
conduct
that
either
constitutes
or
is
tantamount
to
bad
faith.
that
is
my
reading,
and
that
is
what
the
commentators
have
read,
based
upon
roadway
express.
mr.
jacob
laufer
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
laufer
yes,
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
jacob
laufer
yes,
indeed,
your
honor.
and
that
is
really
the
core
of
our
contention,
because
the
law
firm
is
not
the
person
who
signed
it,
is
not
the
individual
who
signed
it--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--i
would
submit
that
it
could
not.
i
would
contend--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--i
believe
that's
so,
and
i
believe
it
may
do
that
in
several
different
ways,
if
i
may,
your
honor.
i
believe
a
sanction
is
a
punishment,
if
i
may
respond.
a
sanction
is
a
punishment.
a
person
who
is
brought
before
a
court
on
a,
on
a,
on
a
rule
11
violation
is,
is
deserving
of
some
sanction,
is
deserving
of
some
punishment.
it
is
within
the
district
court's
discretion
to
say
that...
what
that
punishment
is
to
be,
whether
it
be
a
disciplinary
referral
to
a
bar
committee,
or
whether
it
be
this
type
of
sanction,
the
imposition
of
a
monetary
fine
or
an
order
to
pay
the
other
attorney's,
the
other
party's
reasonable
attorney's
expenses.
a
state
law,
a
state
law
that
would
say
that
this
person
who
is
deserving
of
sanction
need
not
be
sanctioned,
and
that
the
party
who
is
entitled
to
recover
this
award
is
entitled
merely
to
go
against
the
partnership
or
to
go
against
other
partners
within
the
firm--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--i
would
think
that
in
a
circumstance
where
the
signing
attorney
is
judgment
proof,
i
would
wonder
whether
this
is
an
appropriate
sanction.
i
would
wonder
whether
a
sanction
that
is
illusory,
in
the
sense
o,
off
something
that
could
not
have
an
impact
upon
the
person
who
needs
to
be
punished
or
is
deserving
of
being
punished,
i
wonder
whether
in
the
circumstances
that
is
an
appropriate
sanction.
mr.
jacob
laufer
what
your
honor,
i
believe,
is
referring
to
malpractice
and
the
like,
yes,
yes
indeed,
sir.
under...
under
circumstances...
under,
under
circumstances
where
a
third
party
is
suing
a
law
firm
or
suing
a
partner,
based
upon
some
wrong
doing
that
the
partner
has
done
or
is
determined
to
have
done,
in
that
sort
of
a
circumstance
the,
the
state
goal,
the
operation
of,
of
the
rules
of
partnership
are,
are
calculated
to
make
whole,
to
make
whole
the
person
who
has
been
harmed.
that
is
the
focus.
the
focus
of
rule
11,
as
the
advisory
committee
notes
indicate
and
as
the
language
of
the
rule
really
indicates
to
me,
the
focus
of
rule
11
is
to
punish
and
to
deter,
and,
and,
and--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
jacob
laufer
that
is
so,
your
honor.
the
sanction--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--that
would
be
so,
your
honor.
that
would
be
so.
it's
a
sanction,
it,
it,
it's
a
sanction;
it
is
a
punishment.
now,
the
test,
regarding
the
objective
test,
if,
if...
is,
is,
is
a
function
of,
of
the
reality,
is
a
function
of
the
experience
of
40
years
under
the
old
rule
38
and
under
the
old
rule
11
that
was
enacted
or
promulgated
during
1938.
and
it
was
found
that
too
many
attorneys
were
escaping
through
just
precisely
that
escape
valve
that
was
available,
and
too
many
judges
i
guess
were
willing
to
be
forgiving
in
the
circumstances.
and
it
was
determined
that
it
was
necessary,
in
order
to
make
the
rule
more
effective,
to,
to,
to
turn
to
an
objective
standing.
mr.
jacob
laufer
your
honor,
the
problem...
the
problem
that
the
rule
was
calculated
to
address,
if
one
looks
at
the
advisory
committee
notes,
is
the
problem
of
frivolous
pleadings,
is
the
problem
of
dilatory
practices
and
the
like.
the,
the...
as
a
result
of
that
certain,
certain
functional
changes
were,
were
inserted
into
the
rule,
among
them
this
objective
test.
but
they
were
sanctions
to
begin
with.
the
punishment
under
the
old
rule
was
a
disciplinary
action.
the
punishment
under
the
new
rule
is
a
sanction.
the,
the
advisory
committee
notes
indicate
that
among
the
means
that
the
advisory
committee
has
used
in
order
to
promote
the
goal
of
the
rule,
which
is
deterrence
and
not
fee
shifting,
was
an,
an
entitlement
to
the
district
court
to
impose
fee
shifting
in
appropriate
circumstances.
but
i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
it
is
not
a
fee-shifting
rule.
it
is
not
a
rule
that
changes
the
substance
of
american
law.
it
is
a
rule
that
is
calculated
to
deter
conduct.
mr.
jacob
laufer
the
practical
difference,
your
honor,
is,
i
would
submit,
that
the
court
is
without
power
to
impose
that
sanction
upon
the
firm,
under
the
rule
and
under
its
inherent
powers.
the
practical
difference
is
that
that
firm
is
accepting
a
sanction;
that
firm
is
now
rebuked,
is
now
sanctioned,
which
in
itself
carries
a
stigma,
which
the
rule
doesn't
impose
upon
the
firm,
in
fairness.
mr.
jacob
laufer
the
firm
could
do
that.
i
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
a
firm--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--i,
i
wonder.
i
don't...
happily,
i
don't
have
first
hand
experience,
your
honor,
and,
and
i,
i
suppose
that
on
occasions
it
happens,
yes.
but
that
is
not
because
that
firm
is
rebuked;
that
is
not
because
that
firm
is
sanctioned.
if
the
firm
wishes
to
come
forward
on
behalf
of
one
of
its
members
it
may
do
so.
frankly,
i
think
it...
i
think
it
is
ill
advised
for
a
firm
to
do
that.
mr.
jacob
laufer
the
firm
represents
a
party,
but
the
firm
is
not
attorney
of
record
for
purposes
of
rule
11.
mr.
jacob
laufer
justice
marshall,
that
is
a
difficult...
question
for
me
to
answer
in
the
abstract.
without
question,
the
client--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--without
question,
if
i
might
try
to
answer
it,
justice
marshall,
without
question
the
firm
is
involved
in
the
litigation.
without
question
the
firm's
resources
are
being
used,
the
firm's
partner,
the
partner's
time
is
indeed
the
firm's
time,
arguably;
but
it
is
not
the
firm
that
has
made
a
representation
to
the
court.
it
is
not
the
firm
that
is
wrong
in
court--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--yes,
because
the
rule
rejects...
the
rule
rejects
that
partnership
responsibility.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
i
might
say,
there
is
a
memorandum...
there
is
a
memorandum
which
i
submit
makes
very
clear
what
it
would
seem
to
me
would
be
obvious
in
the
other
circumstance,
even
in
the
absence
of
such
a
memorandum,
and
that
is
the
memorandum
from,
judge
mansfield
and,
and
professor
miller
which
is
quoted
in
our
brief,
and
that
makes
very
plain
what,
what
otherwise
appears
within
the
rule
itself.
the
rule
has,
has
been
intended,
has
been
promulgated
to
deal
in
a
certain
way
with
a
certain
problem.
the
way
the
dual...
rule
deals
with
that
problem
is
by
turning
each,
each
litigation
paper
into
an
oath,
an
oath
of
an
individual.
by,
by
requiring
that
that
attorney
make
a
promise
to
the
court,
even
if
that
attorney
is
a
junior
attorney,
and
the
problem
that
is
posited
in
that
memorandum,
what
if
a
senior
attorney
and
a
junior
attorney
are
both
involved
in
the
preparation
of
a
paper
or
of
a
pleading--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--and
that
is...
that
is
the
system
of
the
rule,
and
i
think
it
is
appropriate.
i
think
it
is
appropriate.
the,
the
promulgators
of
the
rule,
the,
the
advisory
committee
felt
that
the
most
appropriate
way
to
deal
with
this
problem
of
dilatory
pleadings,
of
avoiding
diffusion
of
responsibility,
which
has
been
referred
to
in
connection
with
the
1938
rule,
to
take
one
human
being
and
put
that
one
human
being
forward,
and
make
that
one
human
being
responsible.
lower
courts
have,
have
rejected--
mr.
jacob
laufer
--i
think
this
is
an
evolving
issue.
the
record
reflects
that
the
insurer
in
our
case
has
rejected
coverage,
has
disclaimed
coverage.
i
think
in,
in
the
first
instance
i
think
that
would
be
the
instinct
of
many
insurers,
because
the
sanction
is
a
penalty,
is
a
punishment,
and
it
would
be
against
public
policy,
really,
to
buy
insurance
that
in
the
event
you
do
wrong,
and
wrong
a
court
and
misrepresent
to
a
court,
that
you
will
be
held
harmless
by
an
insurance
carrier.
that
is,
that
is
the
state
of
the
situation
insofar
as
i,
i
know
it.
it
could
evolve,
and
i
don't
know
where
it
would
evolve.
the
partnership
theory...
the
partnership
theory
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
espoused
is
not
even
in
and
of
itself
a
pure
partnership
theory.
the
court
of
appeals
has
indicated
that
in
its
view,
given
general
traditional
partnership
principles,
in
the
ordinary
circumstance,
an
attorney
who
is
a
member
of
a
firm
who
signs
on
behalf
of
that
firm
is
thereby
binding
its...
his
firm
or
her
firm
to
sanctions.
but
it
said,
it
left
open
the
unusual
circumstance,
where
perhaps
partnership
principles
might
not
apply
in
a
given
set
of
circumstances.
i
would
submit,
your
honors,
that
this
is
legislation,
really.
it...
it's
pure
legislation.
it
is
a
policy
determination.
it
is
a
determination
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
more
is
to
be
gained
by
promoting
the
incentive
of
firms
to
monitor
their
attorneys.
i
would
submit
that
an
equally
cogent
argument
could
be
made
that
firms
have
every
incentive,
nevertheless,
to
monitor
the
pleadings
of
their
parties...
of,
of
their
attorneys
who
sign
pleadings.
after
all,
it
is
a
shame,
and
notwithstanding
that,
a
firm
we
submit
ought
not
and
is
not
sanctioned
when
the
newspaper
coverage,
as
inevitably
is
there
within
the
legal
community
and
sometimes
within
the
general
press,
the
law
firm's
name
inevitably
appears,
that
if
so
and
so
of
this
firm
who
has
been
sanctioned...
and
i
think
that
what
is
being
given
up.
and
this
is
a
legislative
toss
up,
it
is
a
give
up
in,
in
terms
of
the
second
circuit's
determination,
which
i
think
is
almost
a
legislative
one.
i
think
it
is
a
legislative
one.
what
is
being
given
up
is
that
precision,
is
that
precision
of
responsibility
that
is
called
for
by
the
rule,
that
recognition
by
that
person
who
is,
who
is
sitting
with
a
pen,
who
is...
who
the
rule
seeks
to
deter,
and
the
knowledge
of
that
person,
that
person's
individual
assets,
that
person's
individual
reputation,
individual
standing
at
the
bar,
are
what...
are,
are
what
are
responsible
here
and
what
are
called
into
question.
and
that
person
is
thereby
chastened,
that
person
is
thereby
made
to
think
twice
or
three
times
before
that
person
signs
such
a
piece
of
paper,
and
that
is
what
would
be
given
up
in
the,
in
the
legislative
toss
up,
really,
that
the
second
circuit
has,
has
accomplished
by,
by
rewriting
the
rule,
i
would
submit.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would...
i
would
ask
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jacob
laufer
thank
you.
just
one
sentence,
your
honor,
if
i
might.
mr.
jacob
laufer
the
argument
that
respondents
are
making
is
an
argument
for
a
different
rule
11,
for
the
wisdom
of
a
different
rule
11,
and
i
submit
that
we
must
deal
with
the
rule
as
it
now
exists,
as
it
has
been
promulgated.
nothing
further,
your
honor.
