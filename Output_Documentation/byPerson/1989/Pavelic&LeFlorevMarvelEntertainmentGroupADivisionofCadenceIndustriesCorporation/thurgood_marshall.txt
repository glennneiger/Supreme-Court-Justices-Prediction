doesn't
the
signer
also
say
that
he
is
authorized
to
put
the
name
down?
justice
marshall
no,
that
the
signer
is
authorized
to
use
the
firm's
name
and
to
sign
on
behalf
of
the
firm.
doesn't
he
say
that?
justice
marshall
well,
what
more
do
we
need?
what
more
do
we
need?
justice
marshall
well,
what
happens,
as
a
practical
matter,
if
a
judge
says
you
did
wrong
and
i
am
going
to
penalize
you,
and
i
am
going
to
fine
you
11,000.
or,
the
judge
says
i
find
you,
the
same
problem
and
all,
and
i
am
going
to
fine
you
1,000
and
the
firm
1...
10,000.
now,
what
is
the
practical
difference?
justice
marshall
but
the,
the
firm
usually
pays
the
debts
of
the
partner,
don't
they,
if
it
is
incurred
in
litigation?
justice
marshall
they
usually
do,
don't
they?
justice
marshall
is
the
firm
in
the
litigation
or
not?
justice
marshall
but
is...
my
question
was
is
the
firm
in
the
litigation?
justice
marshall
not
for
me.
justice
marshall
the
firm...
the
firm
authorized
the
partner
to
sign
its
name
to
the
firm.
the
firm
authorized
that.
and
you
say
the
firm
has
no
responsibility
for
that.
