chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-791,
pavelic
&
leflore
v.
marvel
entertainment
group.
mr.
laufer,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
suppose
no
one
would
suggest
that
if
an
appearing
lawyer
before
a
court
were
held
in
contempt
and
ordered
jailed,
and
he
absconds,
that
one
of
his
partners
could
be
required
to
come
in
and
serve
the
contempt
sentence.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
laufer.
mr.
arnoff,
we
will
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
arnoff,
rule
56
of
course
deals
with
summary
judgments.
and
rule
56(g)
talks
about
affidavits
and
summary
judgment
proceedings
that
are
filed
for
the
purpose
of
delay.
and
at
the
end
of
it,
it
says
that
when
the
court
finds
that
is
the
case,
any
offending
party
or
attorney
may
be
adjudged
guilty
of
contempt.
now,
would
you
say
that
rule
allowed
the
firm
for
which
the
attorney
worked
to
be
judged
guilty
of
contempt?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
wouldn't
partnership
principles
apply
there,
the
way
the
second
circuit
saw
to
apply
them
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
district
court
in
a
rule
56
summary
judgment
action
says
i
hold
you
in
contempt
and
fine
you
$1,000,
and
i
fine
the
law
firm
$<one
thousand>
[=
1,000],
too.
that
wouldn't
do,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
is
that
different
from
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
the
district
court
in
the
rule
56(g)
proceedings
said
i,
i
find
these,
these...
delaying
tactics
have
incurred
$1,000
of
attorneys
fees
unwarranted
for
the
other
side,
and
so
i
am
fining...
i'm
fining
you
$1,000
and
holding
you
in
contempt.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
it
is
not
shifted
from
one
litigant
to
another
in
my
hypothesis.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
arnoff,
is
it
your
contention
that
judge
sweet
in
the
district
court
fixed
the
amount
of
these
sanctions
in
terms
of
attorneys'
fees
that
the
conduct
had
caused
other
parties
to
occur?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
certainly
wasn't
inexpensive
for
the
partnership.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
arnoff,
your
time
has
expired.
do
you
have
any
rebuttal,
mr.
laufer?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
speak
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-791,
pavelic
&
leflore
versus
marvel
entertainment
group
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
