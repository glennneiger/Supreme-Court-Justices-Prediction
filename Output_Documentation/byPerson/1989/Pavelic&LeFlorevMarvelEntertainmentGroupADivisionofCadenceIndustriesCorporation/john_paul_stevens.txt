justice
stevens
well,
if
you
agree
to
that,
why
doesn't
there
inherent
power
here?
justice
stevens
well,
would
you
think
the
inherent
power
of
a
court
is
defined
by
bad
faith?
i
believe
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
is
to
give
an
appropriate
sanction
in
an
appropriate
case,
and
that
the
only
way
to
get
an
appropriate
sanction
is
to...
is
to...
is
to
impose
it
on
the
partnership.
what's...
i
don't
see
how
this
is
different
than
justice
kennedy's
case.
justice
stevens
i
suppose
the
tougher
case
is
the
one
that
the
court
below
referred
to.
we
have
a
national
law
firm
that
employs
local
counsel
and
the
national
law
firm
spends
many,
many,
many
hours
on
some
elaborate
document,
has
local
counsel
file
it
and
sign
it.
it
would
generally
be
a
waste
of
time
for
that
lawyer
to
do
all
the
research
and
so
forth.
but
yet
the
local
counsel
takes
full
responsibility
under
your
view?
justice
stevens
do
you
know
if
this
sort
of
payment
is
covered
by
most
malpractice
policies?
justice
stevens
no,
but
you've
got
to
assume
though
that
the
person
who
signs
it
is
a
lawyer,
even
if
he's
just
out
of
law
school
and
just
passed
the
bar,
takes
responsibility
if
he
or
she
puts
his
name
on
that
paper.
and
you,
you
cannot,
it
seems
to
me,
persuade
me
that,
because
a
senior
partner
told
him
to
do
it,
that
that
is
a
defense.
because
he
has
got
individual
responsibilities.
justice
stevens
well,
the
point
of
the
rule
is
that
whoever
signs
it
better
be
knowledgeable
about
the
case.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
does
rule
11
impose
any
supervisory
obligations
on
anyone
who
does
not
sign
the
pleading?
does
the
rule
impose
any
such...
maybe
good
practice
does,
all
sorts
of
reasons
why
they
should
supervise,
but
does
rule--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
factual
question?
i
know
in
your
brief
that...
describing
the
case
you
point
out,
that
some
of
the
critical
papers
were
filed...
signed
by
the
firm's
name
by
the
individual
lawyer.
is
that
true
of
all
of
the
papers
that
gave
rise
to
the
sanctions?
justice
stevens
so
are
you...
are
you
in
effect
arguing
that
maybe
the
rule
required
an
individual's
signature,
but
in
fact
the
person
who
signed
the
pleadings,
in
this
case,
the
person
was
the
firm,
signing
by
the
individual
partner,
and
therefore,
the
language
of
the
rule
reads
on...
the
discipline
can
be
imposed
on
the
person
who
signs
the
pleadings,
and
that
is
the
partnership.
justice
stevens
even
though
it
didn't...
the
partnership
didn't
have
to
do
it
that
way.
justice
stevens
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
there
are
two
different
arguments
you
might
make.
that
in
all
cases
an
individual...
when
an
individual
signs
you
can
impose
liability
on
the
principal
or
the
firm.
or,
more
narrowly,
you
might
be
arguing
that
in
those
cases
in
which
the
person
who
signs
the
pleading
is
the
firm,
signing
by
an
individual,
then
the
firm
is
itself
liable.
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
that's
a
harder
argument
to
make
in
the
terms
of
the
language
of
the
rule
than
the
other
argument
when
you
say,
in
fact,
the
person
who
signed...
because
the
court
upon
motion
shall
impose
upon
the
person
who
signed
it
sanctions.
and
if
you
are
saying
the
person
who
signed
it
is
the
firm,
because
it
says
a
and
b
by
a,
then
it
seems
to
me
you,
you
fit
into
the
language
of
the
rule
more
nicely.
justice
stevens
well,
that
is
true,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that--
justice
stevens
--but
that
might
not
be
true
if
they
hadn't
said
pavelic
and
whatever
it
was
by
so
and
so.
well,
anyway,
go
ahead.
i,
i
understand
your
position.
