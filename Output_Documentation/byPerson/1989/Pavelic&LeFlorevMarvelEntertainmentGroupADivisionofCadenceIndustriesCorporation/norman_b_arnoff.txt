mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address
the
question
put
by
justice
white
to
my
colleague
at
the
new
york
bar
and
my
adversary.
and
in
essence,
the
question
was
doesn't
the
language
of
the
rule
precisely
and
specifically
talk
about
the
person
who
signed
the
pleadings,
motions
or
other
paper?
title
28,
the
united
states
code
1691,
says
that
all
writs
of
the
court
must
be
signed
by
the
clerk.
it
is
my
understanding
of
the
practice
in
the
southern
and
eastern
district
of
new
york,
and
i
believe
in
this
court,
that
writs
of
the
court
may
be
signed
by
deputies
under
the
authorization
of
the
clerk,
and
that
that
does
not
undermine
the
official
nature
of
the
document.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
but
analogously,
justice
kennedy,
when
a
law
partner
in
the
course
of
partnership
activity,
with
the
authority
of
his
partners,
in
a
litigation
such
as
this,
which
was
a
four-year
litigation
involving
substantial
discovery,
a
very
serious
allegation
of
forgery
against
another
lawyer
who
served
honorably
a
client
for
13
years,
when
he
signs
his
name,
in
essence,
his
signature
is
the
act
of
the
partnership.
and
all
the
more
so
when
the
signature
on
the
pleading
reads
pavelic
&
leflore,
by
ray
l.
leflore.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
justice
scalia,--
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
--i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
the
attorney
of
record,
and
by
custom
and
usage
in
the
southern
and
eastern
district
of
new
york
is
the
law
firm,
can
only
sign
through
a
member
of
the
firm--
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
--as
was
done
in
this
particular
case.
there
was
an
explicit--
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
--it
requires
strict
accountability.
but
that
doesn't
say
sole
accountability
or
sole
liability.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
yes.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
in
the
firm,
yes.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
yes.
and
that
specifically...
that
was
specifically
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
your
honor
alighted
on
the
potential
sharp
practice
that
could
develop
by
a
silent,
unscrupulous
senior
partner
directing
a
junior
partner
or
a
junior
associate
to
sign
a
frivolous
pleading
and
destroy
the
vitality
and
the
deterrent
orientation
of
the
rule.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
and
that's,
and
that's
what
the
advisors'
comments
noted.
that
if
the
junior
is
most
knowledgeable
about
the
case
he
should
sign
the
pleading.
if
the
senior
is
most
knowledgeable
about
the
case,
he
should
sign
the
pleading.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
yes,
and
has
strict
accountability.
but
that
does
not
mean,
as
the
petitioner
suggests,
that
the
law
firm
is
relieved
of
its
obligation
to
supervise,
to
check,
or
to--
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
--the
text...
the
text
does
not.
but
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
contending
for
a
blanket
rule
that
under
any
set
of
facts,
under
any
set
of
circumstances,
there
would
not
be
law
firm
liability.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
yes,
your
honor,
but
we
suggest
that
rule
11
is
a
development,
is
an
incremental
development
of
the
inherent
powers
of
the
court,
including
the
power
to
regulate
practice,
including
the
disciplining
of
attorneys.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
no.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
yes.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
yes.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
no,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
a
material
difference
between
shifting
the
reasonable
litigation
expenses
caused
by
abusive
litigation
practices
and
holding
a
law
firm...
a
lawyer
in
contempt
and
then
holding
the
rest
of
his
law
firm
vicariously
in
contempt.
the
amendment
to
the
rule
in
1983
specifically
talked
about
a
broad
range
of
sanctions.
all
that
is
before
the
court
in
this
particular
case
is
whether
the
law
firm,
in
an
appropriate
case
as
this
one
was,
should
absorb
the
reasonable
litigation
expenses
that
were
incurred
as
a
result
of
the
defense
against
these
frivolous
papers
and
the
forgery
claim
against
the
respondents.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
because
we
are
specifically
focused
on
the
reasonable
litigation
expenses,
one
of
the
range
of
circumstances,
one
of
the
range
of
sanctions...
contemplated
by
rule
11.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
well,
does,
does
the
funds
go
into
the
court
or
to
the
treasury,
or
does
it...
is
it
shifted
from
the...
one
litigant
to
another?
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
well,
i
think
due
process
considerations
would
apply,
and
the
due
process,
the
format
of
due
process
is
suited
for
the
particular
case.
i
think
there
is
a
material
difference
between
the
exercise
of
the
contempt
power
or
referring
an
attorney
to
disciplinary
grievance
committee,
and
the
shifting
of
reasonable
litigation
expenses,
which
is
the
specific
and
limited
focus
of
this
particular
case.
this
court,
in
1958,
in
the
case
of
societe
international
v.
rogers.
in
a
specific
sanction
context
dealing
with
the
casual
use
of
the
words
refusal
and
failure
in
rule
37,
held
that
the
language
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
should
not
be
interpreted
with
too
fine
a
literalism
so
as
to
preclude
a
district
court
from
doing,
from
framing
an
order
to
the
particular
case.
we
contend
that
the
sanctions
in
this
case,
the
reasonable
litigation
sanctions,
were
within
the
court's
discretion
to
fit
to
the
particular
case.
the
rule
provides
that
sanctions,
economic
sanctions,
may
be
allocated
between
client
and
lawyer
to
fit
the
particular
case.
so
may
they
under
the...
within
the
contemplation
and
in
the
intent
of
the
advisors,
be
allocated
between
the
law
firm
and
the
wrongful...
the
wronged...
the
party
that
committed
the
wrong.
the
advisors
talk
about
giving
consideration
to
the
actual
and
presumed
knowledge
of
the
violator.
rather
than
the
two
questions
presented
by
the
petitioner
law
firm,
the
issue
before
this
court,
i
believe,
should
be
better
stated
as
follows:
should
this
court
adopt
a
blanket
rule
of
national
practice
for
the
united
states
district
courts
that,
on
any
set
of
facts,
a
law
firm
will
not
be
held
liable
for
the
reasonable
litigation
expenses
caused
by
the
rule
11
violation
of
one
of
its
members
or
associates.
we
say
definitively
no.
the
uniform
rule
pressed
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case
would
frustrate
the
rule's
deterrent
purposes
and
tie
the
district
court's
hands
in
tailoring
sanctions.
petitioner
law
firm's
interpretation
will
not
dispel
apprehensions
that
efforts
to
obtain
enforcement
will
be
fruitless
by
ensuring
that
the
rule
will
be
applied
when
properly
invoked.
the
case
comes
before
your
honors
as
a
result
of
a
conflict
between
the
fifth
circuit's
holding
in
robinson
versus
national
cash
register
and
the
second
circuit's
holding.
i
believe
a
comparative
analysis
of
those
two
specific
cases
will
justify
your
honors
in
affirming
the
judgment
below,
that
in
this
case,
sanctions
were
appropriate
to
be
imposed
upon
the
law
firm.
there
is
no
direct
conflict
in
one
sense
between
the
two
cases.
both
cases
stand
for
the
proposition
that
liability
under
rule
11
derives
from
the
signature.
the
difference
is
in
robinson
the
signature
limited
liability,
and
the
law
firm
was
held
that
it
could
not
place
its
signature
on
a
piece...
on
a
court
paper
to
constitute
a
rule
11
certificate.
the
robinson
case
interpreted
signature
literally
to
mean
only
the
lawyer
who
manually
wrote
his
name.
the
second
circuit
in
the
calloway
case,
recognized
that
the
law
firm
could
sign
a
pleading
by
one
of
its
members
and
that
the
signature
of
the
individual
member
was
a
partnership
act.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
no.
in,
in
appropriate
cases
the--
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
it
is
mandatory
once
a
violation
is
found
that
a
sanction
be
imposed.
but
the
district
courts
have
the
discretion
to
deal
flexibly
with
a
violation,
to
tailor
the
sanctions
to
the
particular
case.
and
the
rule...
the
advisors
notes
goes
on
to
say
that
consideration
should
be
given
as
to
the
state
of
the
presumed
knowledge
of
the,
of
the,
of
the
violators,
their
actual
knowledge,
and
other
circumstances.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
yes,
your
honor.
he,
one,
assessed
the
total
amount
of
the
sanctions
predicated
on
one
share
of
what
was
caused
to
one
of
the
litigants
in
terms
of
counsel
fees;
the
aggregate
litigation
expenses
were
$900,000.
he
assessed
that
to
be
$200,000.
he
did
not
shift
the
entire
cost
of
$<nine
hundred
thousand>
[=
900,000].
he
operated
within
the
appropriate
discretion
and
i
think
the
intent
of
the
advisors
that
the
least-onerous
sanction
under
the
circumstances
should
be
appropriated
to,
to
satisfy
the
deterrent
orientation
of
the,
of
the
rule.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
the
partnership,
justice
stevens,
was
formed
in
october
1984.
a
number
of
frivolous
papers
were
signed
individually
prior
to
that
by
ray
leflore
and
by
a
previous
law
firm,
leflore
&
eagan.
subsequent
to
october
1984,
all
papers,
including
those
found
by
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
to
have
been
in
violation
of
the
rule,
were
signed
pavelic
&
leflore
by
ray
leflore.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
yes.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
well,
i--
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
--justice
stevens,
we
are
arguing
here
that
the
firm
explicitly
signed
by
the
appearance
of
the
signature,
pavelic
&
leflore
by
ray
leflore.
equally,
if
the
signature
was
merely
ray
l.
leflore,
as
it
was
in
the
fifth
circuit
where
it
was
by
david
black
in
the
robinson
case,
the
signature
of
the
individual
is
a
partnership
act.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
justice
stevens,
i
know
of
no
way
that
a
legal
entity,
a
corporation
or
a
partnership
can
sign
a
document
other
than
through
an
agent.
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
terminology--
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
--the
person
who
signed,
would
mean
a
legal
person
as
well
as
a
natural
person,
a
human
being.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
we,
we,
we
would
argue
in
support
of
both
propositions.
i
believe
i
have
the
easier
case
because
of
the
explicit
signature.
the
principal
challenge--
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
--justice
scalia,
later
on
in
the
language
of
the
rule,
and
i
believe
that
portion
that
deals
with
the
imposition
of
sanctions,
the
specific
terminology
is
the
person
who
signed.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
we
would
also
argue
that
this
rule
should
be
interpreted
in
the
light
and
consistent
with
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
1.
not
strictly,
not
too
literally,
not
semantically,
but
in
order
to
secure
the
just,
inexpensive
and...
determination
of
every
action.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
no,
but
it
was...
and
it
certainly
wasn't
inexpensive
for
the
defendants
in
this
case,
and
particularly,
my
client
who
was
a
lawyer
of
good
standing
who
was
accused
of
forging
a
document
and
who
went
through
four
years
of,
of,
of
litigation,
in
respect
to...
and
not
only
was
his
name
involved
but
also
his
potential...
economic
liability.
the
principal
challenge
to
the
interpretation
of
the
second
circuit
by
the
petitioner
in
reliance
on
the
fifth
circuit
case
of
robinson
versus
national
cash
register
is
that
the
second
circuit
violated
the
plain
meaning
of
the
rule
and
thereby
legislated.
but
both
courts,
your
honors,
could
not
discern
a
plain
meaning
to
the...
rule.
both
courts
had
to
resort
to
policy
considerations.
the
second
circuit
at,
at
the...
in
the
petition,
page
60a,
makes
a
reference
that
the...
of
a
lack
of
plain
meaning,
and
specifically,
the
fifth
circuit
at
808
fed
second
1128
held
it
is
unclear,
however,
whether
rule
11
sanctions
can
only
be
imposed
on
an
attorney
who
actually
signs
a
document
or
whether
sanctions
can
also
be
imposed
on
an
attorney
who
did
not
sign
the
document
deemed
to
violate
rule
11
but
who
made
an
appearance
in
the
suit.
the
fifth
circuit
emphasized
the...
their
concern
about
satellite
litigation,
and
that
if
a
non-signer
was
held
liable
they
would
have
to
enquire
into
the
relative
culpability
of
attorneys.
the
second
circuit
emphasized
deterrence
and
the
internal
monitoring
that
was
necessary
and
should
be
necessary
to
avoid
frivolous
filings.
we
respectfully
contend
that
the
fifth
circuit
interpretation
weakened
the
prime
objective
and
orientation
of
the
rule
deterrence.
the
example
i
gave
before,
which
i
believe
should
be
restated
and
restated,
is
the
silent
partner
instructing
the
junior
or
associate
to
sign
the
frivolous
paper.
it
is
a
potential
for
sharp
practice.
the
fifth
circuit,
moreover,
was
unrealistic
in
encouraging
multiple
participants
in
preparation
of
one
legal
document
all
to
sign.
i
don't
think
that
will
happen.
the
second
circuit
applied
the
advisors'
comments:
the
district
court
retains
the
necessary
flexibility
to
deal
appropriately
with
violations
of
the
rule.
it
has
discretion
to
tailor
sanctions
to
the
particular
facts
of
the
case
with
which
it
should
be
well
acquainted.
this
was
a
built-in
safeguard.
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest,
contrary
to
the
argument
of
the
petitioner,
that
the
second
circuit
legislated
the
adoption
of
partnership
law.
that
there
is
a
material
difference
between
the...
the
traditional
application
of
partnership
law
and
the
formulation,
the
flexible
formulation
in
the
second...
of
the
second
circuit
in
this
particular
case.
as
i
understand
partnership
law,
in
the
course
of
the
partnership
and
with
the
authority
of
the
partners,
if
a
fraudulent
misrepresentation
is
made
upon
a
third
party,
the
partnership
is
liable.
in
terms
of
the,
the
formulation
of
the
second
circuit,
the
exceptional
circumstances,
if
there
was
a
fraud
on
the
partnership,
if
there
was
a
showing
of
an
internal
monitoring
system,
and
if
the
partnership
could
not
reasonably
detect
by
its
supervisory
mechanisms
the,
the
fraud,
the,
the
frivolous
filing,
then
it
would
be
appropriate
to
relieve
the
partnership
and
impose
the
full
weight
of
the
sanction
on
the
individual
wrongdoer.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
true.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
you
should
come
out
differently
for
the
partnership.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
because
the,
the
prime
purpose
of
the
rule
is
deterrence.
it...
a
secondary
purpose
is
compensation.
if
the
partnership
can
show
that
they
had
an
internal
monitoring
system
and
they
did
their
job,
and
they
supervise,
and
they
could
not
by
reasonable
means
have
discovered
this,
then
the
rule,
which
is
basically
an
equitable
rule,
should
relieve
the
partnership.
mr.
norman
b.
arnoff
justice
scalia,
if,
if
the
individual
lawyer
could
show
that
he
conducted
a
pre-filing
inquiry,
that
a
reasonably
competent
lawyer
could
conclude
the
bonafides
of
the
legal
claim,
he
would
be
able
to
exonerate
himself
from
the...
imposition
of
a
rule
11
finding.
but
what
i
am
saying
in
this
particular
case,
assume
that
there
was
a
violation.
in
the
ordinary
typical
case,
as
this
case
was,
traditional
partnership
principles
should
apply.
but
if
the,
the
partnership
came
back,
as
they
did
not
do
in
this
case,
and
showed
there
were
exceptional
circumstances,
showed
they
weren't...
that
there...
that
there
was
concealment
or
fraud,
showed
that
they
had
a
monitoring
system,
equitably,
they
should
not
have
to
incur
a
sanction.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
second
circuit
legislated,
nor
did
they
exercise
in
a
raw
fashion,
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
which
has
always
been
a
power
