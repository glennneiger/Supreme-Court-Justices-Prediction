justice
kennedy
and
suppose
you
had
an
aggravated
case
in
which
two
senior
partners
said
well,
this
pleading
is
marginal,
we
might
get
in
trouble
with
it,
let's
just
have
the
junior
associates
sign
it.
that
wasn't
this
case,
but
suppose
you
had
that
case?
would
the
district
court
be
powerless
under
the
rules
to
impose
any
sanctions
on
the
law
firm?
would
it
just
have
to
resort
to
state
disciplinary
procedures?
justice
kennedy
under
what...
under
what
rule?
justice
kennedy
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
rule
that
says
it
is
a
punishment
or
that
is
punitive,
and
in
fact,
the
sanction
is
an
objective
one.
the,
the
sanction,
the
test
for
whether
or
not
the
sanction
should
be
imposed
is
objective.
justice
kennedy
so
the,
the
pure
heart
and
the
empty
head
are
not
a
defense.
justice
kennedy
which
indicates
to
me
that
it
is
not
a
punishment,
that
it
is
a
liability
that
we
impose
in
order
to
make
the
party
that
is
injured
whole.
justice
kennedy
well,
of
course,
it
is
under
seal
of
the
court
that...
the
statute
also
says
it
shall
be
under
seal
of
the
court.
justice
kennedy
but
that
can
be
an
associate
as
well
as
a
partner,
i
take
it?
justice
kennedy
do
you
say
it
is
mandatory
that
the
court
impose
the
fine
on
the
law...
law
firm?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
the
rule
is
phrased
in
mandatory
language.
justice
kennedy
what,
what
is
there
in
the
rule
that
gives
discretion?
