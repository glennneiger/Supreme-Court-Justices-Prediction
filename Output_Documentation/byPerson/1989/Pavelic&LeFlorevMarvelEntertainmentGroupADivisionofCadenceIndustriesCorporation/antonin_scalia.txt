justice
scalia
if
you
are
going
to
apply
agency
principles
to
the
second
half
of
the
rule,
why
don't
you
apply
it
to
the
first
half?
so,
when
it
says
that
every
pleading
shall
be
signed
by
at
least
one
attorney
of
record
in
the
attorney's
individual
name,
i
suppose
i
could
have
somebody
else
sign
it
for
me
in
my
individual
name,
right?
could
i
do
that?
you
apply
the
same
agency
principle,
right,
qui,
qui,
qui
facet
per
allium
facet
per
se,
you
know.
justice
scalia
you,
you
wouldn't
allow
that
to
happen
for
the
first
section,
would
you?
doesn't
that
mean
i
have
to
sign
it?
justice
scalia
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
so,
so
you--
justice
scalia
--you
think
when
the
rule
says
in
the
attorney's
individual
name,
that
means
the
law
firm's
name?
justice
scalia
doesn't
a
lawyer
have
to
sign
a
federal
pleading
in
his
individual
name?
justice
scalia
all
right.
can
he
have
someone
else
do
it
for
him?
justice
scalia
in
order
to
decide
this
case,
do
we
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
you
can
get
the
law
firm
under
some
other
basis
than
rule
11?
justice
scalia
wasn't
it...
it
rested
below
on
rule
11,
didn't
it?
justice
scalia
so,
if
we
think
you
can't
do
it
under
rule
11,
that
is
the
end
of
the
case.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
you
know,
elsewhere
the
rule
reads
the
signature
of
an
attorney
or
party.
it
doesn't
say
person.
the
signature
of
an
attorney
or
party
constitutes
a
certificate
by
the
signer.
i
mean,
the
whole
rule
seems
to
be
focussing
on
the
individual.
now,
there
is
no
way
to
say...
you
could
say
the
firm
is
a
person,
right,
a
juridical
person,
but
you
could
not...
hardly
say
it
is
a
juridical
attorney.
it
says
the
signature
of
an
attorney
or
party
constitutes
a--
justice
scalia
--well,
that
is
so,
but
i
am
talking
about
the
rule
as
a
whole
seems
to
be
focusing
on
an
individual
attorney.
justice
scalia
why
is
that?
the
individual
wrongdoer
doesn't
get
off
if
it's...
if
he
could
show
the
same
thing.
right?
rule
11
will
be
imposed
upon
the
individual,
even
if
he
comes
forward
with
such
excuses
as
that,
right?
it
doesn't
require
bad
faith
on
his
part.
justice
scalia
so
why
should
you...
why
should
you
come
out
any
differently
for
the
partnership,
if
the
partnership
is
covered
by
the
rule?
justice
scalia
why?
justice
scalia
although
it
wouldn't
relieve
the
individual,
even
if
he
came
forward
and
showed
i
had
a
monitoring
system,
i
had
the
investigators
who
did
all
this
check
it
out,
my
secretaries
checked
it
out,
it
really
wasn't
my
fault.
and
you
would
say
hey,
that
is
tough
luck,
rule
11
is
rule
11.
it
is
an
absolute
liability,
isn't
it,
for
him?
but
you're
saying
not
for
the
partnership.
why?
why
would
you
make
a
difference
between
an
innocent
partnership
and
an
innocent
individual
lawyer?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit.
it
is
one
of
the
few
textual
construction
cases
that
is
easy
to
describe,
if
not
to
decide.
the
complaint
and
the
other
papers
filed
on
behalf
of
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
were
found
to
contain
allegations
that
had
no
basis
in
fact
and
had
not
been
investigated
sufficiently
by
counsel.
consequently,
the
district
court
imposed
monetary
sanctions
under
rule
11
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
requiring
money
to
be
paid
to
the
defendant
who
had
incurred
expenses
because
of
these
unsupported
allegations.
the
court
imposed
those
sanctions
not
only
against
the
individual
lawyer
who
would
sign
the
papers
but
also
against
that
lawyer’s
firm.
the
law
firm
unsuccessfully
argued
to
the
district
court
and
on
appeal
to
the
second
circuit
that
the
only
proper
object
of
the
sanctions
was
the
individual
lawyer.
rule
11
reads
in
part
as
follows:
"every
pleading
motion
and
other
paper
of
a
party
represented
by
an
attorney
shall
be
signed
by
at
least
one
attorney
of
record
in
the
attorney’s
individual
name
whose
address
shall
be
stated.
a
party
not
represented
by
an
attorney
shall
sign
the
party’s
pleading,
motion,
or
other
paper,
and
state
the
party’s
address.
the
signature
of
an
attorney
or
party
constitutes
a
certificate
by
the
signer
that
the
signer
has
read
the
pleading,
motion,
or
other
paper
that
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge,
information,
and
belief
it
is
well-grounded
in
fact
and
is
warranted
by
existing
law
and
is
not
interposed
for
any
improper
purpose
such
as
to
harass
or
cause
unnecessary
delay.
if
a
pleading
motion
or
other
paper
is
not
signed,
it
shall
be
stricken."
and
finally,
here
is
the
provision
at
issue
here,
"if
a
pleading,
motion,
or
other
paper
is
signed
in
violation
of
this
rule,
the
court
upon
motion
or
upon
its
own
initiative
shall
impose
upon
the
person
who
signed
it
a
represented
party
or
both
an
appropriate
sanction."
we
hold
contrary
to
the
view
of
the
second
circuit
here
that
the
phrase
“the
person
who
signed
it”
in
the
last
sentence
refers
only
to
the
individual
signing
lawyer.
we
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
text
conveys
this
just
as
the
requirement
of
signature
is
imposed
personally
upon
the
individual
attorney,
so
is
the
sanction.
its
purpose
is
to
bring
home
to
the
individual
signer
his
personal
non-delegable
responsibility.
it
may
well
be
that
in
some
cases,
the
firm
will
be
more
solvent
than
the
individual
attorney,
but
the
purpose
of
these
provisions
is
sanction
and
not
compensation.
it
is
arguable
perhaps
that
it
would
more
effectively
deter
misconduct
to
impose
sanctions
on
both
an
attorney
and
his
firm,
but
we
do
not
think
the
text
of
the
rule
can
fairly
be
read
that
way
and
it
is
our
job
to
apply
that
text,
not
to
improve
upon
it.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit
is
reversed
on
this
point
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
