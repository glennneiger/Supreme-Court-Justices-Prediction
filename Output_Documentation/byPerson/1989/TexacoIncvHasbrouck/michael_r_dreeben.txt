mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
that
a
supplier's
use
of
a
functional
discount
constitutes
price
discrimination
when
the
wholesaler
passes
on
a
portion
of
the
discount
to
retailers.
the
supplier
cannot
show
that
the
functional
discount
is
cost
based,
and
the
retailers
who
buy
from
the
wholesaler
compete
with
other
retailers
who
buy
directly
from
the
supplier.
the
united
states
and
the
federal
trade
commission
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
should
be
rejected.
a
supplier
should
not
be
held
liable
for
the
independent
pricing
decisions
made
by
a
wholesaler
who
receives
a
legitimate
functional
discount.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
your
honor.
the
interpretation
of
the
language
of
the
robinson-patman
act
that's
in
question
here
is
section
2(a),
which,
as
you
read,
provides
that
it's
unlawful
for
a
person
engaged
in
commerce
to
discriminate
in
price
where
the
effect
of
such
discrimination
may
be
substantially
to
lessen
competition
and
to
cause
the
competitive
effects
described
in
the
statute.
we
believe
that
the...
the
word
and
the
language
of
the
statute
that
should
be
interpreted
here
are
the
effect
language.
the
question
is
whether
a
discrimination
between
a
wholesaler
and
a
retailer
in
a
legitimate
functional
discount
causes
the
requisite
anticompetitive
effect
described
in
the
statute.
the
federal
trade
commission
believes
that
it
does
not
because
the
primary
purpose
of
a
functional
discount
is
to
shift
distribution
functions
from
a
supplier
to
a
middleman
who
assists
in
getting
the
goods
to
market.
the
interpretation
of
the
language
effect
is
that...
is
the
identical
interpretation
given
by
the
1955
report
of
the
attorney
general's
national
committee
to
study
the
antitrust
laws.
that
committee
also
took
a
look
at
these
issues
and
felt
that
the
appropriate
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
to
look
to
the
word
"effect"
and
to
hold
that
a
legitimate
functional
discount
does
not
cause
the
requisite
anticompetitive
effects.
there
are
two
reasons
primarily--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
your
honor.
the...
the
interpretation
of
legitimate
functional
discount
that
we
bring
to
those
words
involves
three
elements.
the
first
is
that
the
wholesaler
is
not
in
fact
competing
with
retailers
for--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--as
to
the
early
marketing
period
in
which
dompier
was
selling
to
independent
retailers,
we
believe
that
he
does.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
as
to
the
latter
period,
we
believe
that
he
does
not.
he
integrated
vertically--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
federal
trade
commission
hasn't
taken
a
position
on
that,
but
i
believe--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--under...
under
the
test
that
we
proposed,
the
discount,
once
dompier
is
performing
the
retail
functions,
would
disqualify
him
from
the
discount.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
stevens,
we
do
believe
that
as
to
part
of
the
liability
period--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
instructions
to
the
jury,
justice
stevens,
did
not
isolate
any
point
at
which
dompier
was
selling
only
to
retailers
for
purposes
of
damages
and
instruct
the
jury
that...
that
it
should
not
impose
damages
unless
it
concluded
that
the
function--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
the
instructions
that
were
given
were
extraordinarily
vague
on
the
point
and
that
there--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
the
instruction
to
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
believe
that
if
the
combination
of
jury
instructions
18
and
23(a)
would
permit
the
imposition
of
liability
on
dompier
for
the
time
when
he
sold
to
retailers
even
when
the
discount
that
he
received
which
occasioned
the
price
discrimination
was,
in
our
view,
a
legitimate
functional
discount,
and
since
the
jury
wasn't
told
to
exclude
that
portion
of
damages,
to
that
extent
the
judgment
is
infirm.
the
second--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
o'connor,
to
clarify
our
position--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--at
the
petition
stage,
the
question
was
whether
this
court's
review
was
warranted,
and
we
believed
that
the
ultimate
importance
of
the
issue
that
is
raised
by
petitioner
to
the
judgment
in
this
case
is
somewhat
minor
because
the
damages
period
ran
from
1972
to
1981,
and
the
portion
of
that
period
during
which
we
believe
dompier's
discount
was
lawful
was
only
a
very
early
part
of
the
period.
notwithstanding
that,
the
jury
was
not
given
any
way
to
break
out
the
lawful
period
from
the
unlawful
period,
and
thus,
we
believe
on
remand,
the
court
of
appeals
might
conclude
that
the
entire
period
is
tainted.
this
court
might
also
reach
that
judgment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
defendant
objected
to
the
instructions
that
were
given--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
stevens,
i'm
not
aware
that
they
proposed
a
specific
instruction
that
said
you
have
to
look
at
the
discount--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
yes,
the
defendant
did
object
to
having
any
liability
imposed
on
it
for
that
period,
but
it
didn't
request
an
instruction
to
the
jury
to
make
that
determination.
it
simply
said
the
jury
shouldn't
be
given
that
information
to
decide.
at
the
cert
stage,
we
also--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
they
would
matter.
they
would
bear,
your
honor,
on
the
question
of
whether
the
discount
was
indeed
a
legitimate
functional
discount.
we
think
that
in
addition
to
a
requirement
that
the
wholesaler
and
the
retailer
not
compete,
there
is
also
a
requirement
that
the
wholesaler
have
to
be
performing
some
functions
that
are
characteristic
of
a
wholesaler,
such
as
distributing
the
product,
absorbing
credit
risks,
actually
searching
out
customers
to
sell
to
on
resale,
and
that
that
inquiry
is
a
qualitative
kind
of
judgment
that
is
made,
could
be
made
by
a
court
in
the
summary
judgment
context
and
would
not
be
difficult
to
administer.
but
once
it's
determined
that
in
fact
a
wholesaler
is
receiving
a
functional
discount,
we
don't
believe
that
there
should
be
a
further
inquiry
that
requires
the
supplier
to
justify
that
discount
based
on
the
costs
incurred
by
the
wholesaler.
we
think
that
would
be
completely
impracticable.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
there
are
two
reasons,
justice
scalia.
the
first
is
that
there
is
the
independent
decision
of
the
wholesaler
which
the
supplier
cannot
control.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's
not
quite
the
same
as...
as
the
case
that
this
court
confronted
in
falls
city
v.
vanco,
where
there,
in
fact,
were
two
different
prices
given
to
people
at
the
same
functional
level.
it's
different
when
you
give
a
cheaper
price
to
a
wholesaler.
that's
the
only
way
the
wholesaler
can
be
in
business.
but
more
fundamentally,
we
think
the
word
"effect"
has
to
be
read
in
light
of
the
purposes
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
congress
passed
this
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
multi-leveled
distribution
systems.
wholesalers
were
the
very
persons
who
came
forward
and
requested
the
act
in
the
first
place.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we're
relying
on
an
interpretation
of
the
language
that
would
construe
it
in
light
of
congress'
purposes,
which
is
pretty
much
the
way
this
court
has
handled
a
number
of
robinson-patman
issues
in
the
past.
the
language
of
the
statute
has
been
recognized
to
be
somewhat
inexact,
and
in
order
to
give
effect
to
what
congress
intended,
the
court
has...
has
taken
a
close
look
at
the
precise
types
of
pricing
arrangements.
now
a
discount
to
a
wholesaler
being
exactly
what
congress
wanted
to
foster
and
preserve
multi-layered
distribution
systems,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
that
intent
to
then
give
effect
the
kind
of
reading
that
was
given
to
it
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
to
the
extent
that
congress
took
a
look
at
that
issue,
it
did
not
prescribe
any
kind
of
a
test
that
would
be
workable.
it
would
not
be
a
workable
test
for
suppliers
to
have
to
investigate
the
cost
of
their
wholesalers.
wholesale
discounts
are
set
with
the
aggregate...
i
see
that
my
time
is
up.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
your
honor.
wholesale
discounts
are
set
in
the
aggregate
looking
at
the
average
cost
that
a
supplier
is
going
to
face
looking
at
a
number
of
different
wholesalers
who
he
deals
with
over
a
long
period
of
time.
the
ninth
circuit's
test
really
requires
an
ongoing
adjustment
of
the
wholesale
discount
as
the
wholesaler
becomes
more
efficient.
so
to
the
extent
that
the
wholesaler
decides
to
become
price
aggressive
or
more
efficient
in...
in
performing
his
distribution
function,
the
ninth
circuit
would
require
that
the
wholesale
discount
be
contracted,
and
then
you
would
have
wholesale
discounts
that
varied
between
every
different
wholesaler,
and
you
would
be
right
back
in
the
situation
of
price
discrimination
between
wholesalers,
which
is
something
that
the
act
also
prohibits.
