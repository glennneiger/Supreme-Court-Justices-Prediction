mr.
robert
h.
whaley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
divert
from
my
prepared
remarks
for
a
moment
to
answer
a
couple
of
questions
i
think
were
important
that
were
asked
by
the
justices.
first,
there
is
no
instruction
before
this
court
that
you
are
asked
to
rule
should
have
been
given
and
was
not
given.
the
only
objection
to
the
instruction
that
permitted
damages
to
be
awarded
for
the
pass-on
of
a
discount
to
the
retail
level
was
instruction
18.
texaco
proposed
an
instruction
that
was
virtually
identical
to
that
instruction,
and
it's
attached
to
our
brief.
texaco's
only
objection
to
that
instruction
was
based
upon
proximate
cause.
justice
o'connor,
you
asked
about
instruction
20
and
whether
there
was
a
proper
objection
in
23(a).
you
were
told
by
texaco
that
they
objected
to
23(a)
and
that
is
before
the
court.
that
is
not
true.
if
you
go
to
the
transcript
of
the
testimony
at
pages
3156
through
3158,
you
will
find
that
the
day
before,
texaco
had
proposed
a
factual
functional
discount
instruction
that
the...
that
the
jury
should
be
given
to
review
the
functional
discount
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
next
day...
the
court
the
day
before
refused
to
give
that
instruction.
the
next
day
the
court
wrote
its
own
instruction,
and
it
became
23(a).
i
asked
the
court
not
to
give
the
instruction
unless
texaco
wanted
it
to
be
given
because
it
would
just
create
error
if
they
didn't
want
it.
it
would
be
unnecessary.
the
judge
then
asked
texaco
on
the
next
page...
we're
now
looking
at
3156
through
3158...
whether
or
not
that
instruction
should
be
given.
this
is
what
the
court
said.
coming
back
to
the
court's
proposed
instruction,
then--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--the
record,
your
honor.
it's
not
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
no,
sir.
the
record
is
downstairs.
the
question
was
asked
whether
that...
that
instruction,
the
court's
instruction
23(a),
should
be
given.
the
court
said,
coming
back
to
the
court's
proposed
instruction,
even
though
texaco
does
not
agree
with
the
language,
what
is
texaco's
position
as
to
whether
or
not
it
should
or
should
not
be
given.
texaco
replied
that
they
reserve
their
objection
to
the
instruction
had
not
been
given
the
day
before.
so
without
waiving
the
argument
as
to
that
prior
instruction,
i
would
prefer
that
this
instruction
be
given
rather
than
no
instruction.
there
is
no
instruction
here.
you
are
being
asked
to
grant
an
immunity
as
a
matter
of
law
that
congress
didn't
grant
to
assail
to
a
purchaser
that
texaco
denominates
as
a
wholesaler
regardless
of
the
impact
on
the
retail
level
of
competition.
this
immunity
has
never
been
extended
by
the
court
in
the
past.
this
court
is
loathe
to
grant
immunities
to
antitrust
statutes.
it
typically
looks
at
the
language
of
the
statute
to
see
if
the
violation
fits
within
the
statutory
language.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
yes,
your
honor.
there's
at
least
two.
perkins
v.
standard
oil,
this
court
considered
a
varied
distribution
circumstance
that's
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
that's
the
closest.
a
lower
court
in
ftc
v.
standard
oil
took
the
same
position.
i
might
tell
the
court
that
the
ftc
has
not
been
consistent
in
its
position
on
this
type
of
injury.
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
robinson-patman
amendments,
that
ftc
took
the
position
that
mere
pricing
at
wholesale
versus
retail
versus
the
jobber
level
was
unlawful
unless
it
was
cost-justified
because
it
could
impact
competition.
you
will
find
those
cases
in
south
bend
bake
company
v.
ftc
in
the
1920s.
the
ftc
took
the
exact
same
position
in
1941
when
it
sued
standard
oil.
it
has
taken
the
same
position
in
the
doubleday
case,
saying
that
a
functional
discount
must
be
viewed
under
the
statutory
language,
does
it
impact
competition?
in
the
mueller
case,
it
held
that
a
functional
discount
was
not
immune
as
a
matter
of
law
because
it
could
be
abused.
in
the
latest
boise
cascade
case
the
ninth
circuit
said...
excuse
me.
the
ftc
said
that
a
functional
discount
should
be
reviewed
by
the
cost
justification
language
of
the
statute.
if
this
court
is
disposed
to
consider
whether
or
not
a
12(b)(6)
type
motion
could
be
made
in
these
circumstances,
it
should
look
at
the
evidence
in
this
case
of
what
type
"legitimate
functional
discount"
was
allegedly
involved.
for
instance,
texaco's
president
said
in
a
letter
that
the
distributors
such
as
mr.
dompier
had
shed
their
wholesaler
functions
and
were
no
longer
performing
those
functions,
and
they
were
not
using
them
in
the
distribution
process
itself.
he
said,
the
president
of
texaco,
that
the
magnitude
of
that
discount
which
was
not
being
used
was
causing
dramatic
shifts
of
sales
from
the
two
classes
of
trade
we
have
in
conflict
right
here;
and
he
said
that
it
was
threatening
the
viability
of
thousands
of
texaco
retailers.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
he
said
that
this
trend
had
begun
in
several
years--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--yes,
ma'am,
the
letter
was--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
was
a
factual
issue
in
the...
in
the
district
court--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--the
district
court
never
had
to
enter
a
finding
on
that
because
the
jury
considered
that.
the
evidence
was
that
dompier
was
retailing
since
about
1969
through
two
stations
known
as
red
carpet
where
his
father
set
the
price
at
both
retail
and
wholesale,
and
that
was
a...
that
was
a
highly
protested
issue.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
you
certainly
can't
accept
it
as
to
gull
oil
company.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
no,
ma'am.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
i
believe
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
outcome
of
this
case,
but
i--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--you
can
if
you
so
desire.
i
believe
it
was
a
factual
issue
that
was
highly
contested.
the...
there
was
a
contention
that...
that...
that
red
carpet
was
not
a...
a
retail
outlet,
and
it
was
obvious
that
from
the
evidence
that
it
was
completely
controlled
by
dompier,
and
he
set
the
price
at
the
retail
pump.
gull
distributed
it
at
retail
throughout
the
period
of
time
from
1972
until
1981.
the...
the
evidence
also
showed
that
texaco's
vice
president--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--yes.
we
contended
that
gull--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--well,
i
don't
believe
you
can
from
the
evidence.
i
believe
it
was
a
jury
issue.
she
asked
me
what
the
district
judge
did,
and
it...
it
was
not
a
judge-tried
case.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
and
so
i
believe
from
the
evidence
that
went
to
the
jury
that
the
jury
could
properly,
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out,
have
concluded
that
dompier
and
gull
were
retailing
throughout
the
case,
and
they
were.
red
carpet
was
owned
solely
by
mr.
dompier.
he
said
that--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--that's
correct.
i
don't
believe
you
can.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
well,
i
don't
know.
there
was
no
specific
finding
with
respect
to
red
carpet
or
any
of
the
stations.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
there
were
no
interrogatories.
there
were
none
asked
for.
now,
there's
no
issue
up
here
about
special
interrogatories.
when
determining
whether
congress
would
have
wanted
to
exempt
this,
this
type
of
conduct,
you
should
consider
this.
in
the
evidence
in
this
case,
texaco's
own
market
study
showed
that
the
entire
discount,
the
4
cent
discount,
was
being
passed
on
by
some
wholesalers,
and
they
were
only
taking
their
wholesale
profit
from
the
hauling
allowance;
that
the
hauling
allowance
alone
that
was
given
separate
from
the
discount
was
sufficient
for
them
to
take
a
wholesale
profit.
query
whether
congress
ever
would
have
contended
or
suggested
that
that
type
of
discount
would
be
immune
from
scrutiny
by
this
court.
we
know
that
the...
the
storage
facilities
of
dompier
oil
company
were
smaller
than
the
storage
facilities
of
the
plaintiffs'
own
stations.
there
was
no
bulk
storage
that
was
used
in
the
distribution
of
gasoline.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
your
honor,
i
believe
he
is.
i
believe
the
only
thing
you
can
say
that
he
is
doing
at
wholesale
is
he
is
technically
selling
the
product,
but
he...
he's
being
paid
for
the
delivery
separately,
and
he's
performing
no
other
function.
in
fact,
the
functions
are...
are
totally
meaningless
in
this
transaction.
this
discount
was
not
cost-justified,
although
texaco
asserted
that...
that
defense.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
by
the...
the
statutory
defense
that
if...
if
a
discount
takes
into
account
the
seller's
cost,
then
it's
cost-justified.
they
were
unable
to
do
that.
they
were
unable
to
show
their
competitors
required
them
to
do
it,
that
they
were
meeting
the
competitive
offer
of
exxon
or
shell
or
someone
else.
and
there
is
a
substantial
injury
to
competition;
that
is,
the
economic
viability
of
thousands
of
stations
were
admittedly
affected
by
this.
given
that
posture,
it
is...
it
seems
to
me
beyond
dispute
that
a
court
could
not
say
that
you
would
consider
that
type
of
discount
as
a
matter
of
law
would
be
immune
from
scrutiny
by
this
court.
the
robinson-patman
act's
language
prescribes
by
its
very
terms
this
type
of
discount,
this
type
of
price
difference.
this
court
in
morton
salt
in
1947
said
that
congress'
intention
that
they...
that
they...
that
congress
considered
it
an
evil
that
large
purchasers
could
get
discounts
merely
because
of
their
size
over
small
retail
purchasers,
and
they
prescribed
such
price
differences
unless
they
were
cost-justified
under
the
statute
or
meeting
competition.
this
court
later,
in
henry
broch
and
fred
meyer,
said
that
it
was
congress'
intention
to
outlaw
all
devices
by
which
larger
purchasers
could
get
better
prices.
in
this
case,
texaco
is
submitting
to
the
court
that
it
has
come
up
with
a
device
that
will
work;
and
that
is,
it
can
favor
large
retail
purchasers
by
calling
the
discount
a
legitimate
functional
discount.
in
this
case,
the
court
will
find
the
evidence,
in
fact,
involved
texaco
in
the
very
effort
to
have
this
discount
reach
the
retail
level.
texaco
in
the
early
1970s
wanted
to
begin
to
supply
a
high
volume
market
in
spokane
and
elsewhere.
they
knew
from
their
own
records
that
it
could
not
be
done
by
anyone
who
was
paying
retail
tank
wagon,
which
our
clients
were
paying.
that
retail
tank
wagon
was...
in
spokane
was
the
highest
traditionally
posted
retail
tank
wagon
in
town.
how
did
they
go
about
doing--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--the...
the
knowledge
element
is...
is
being
addressed,
your
honor,
one,
because
texaco
is
saying
they
have
a
12(b)(6)
defense,
and
i'm
showing
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
secondly,
where
they
say
that
they
should
be
immune
from
the
independent
decision
of
an
intervening
buyer,
i
want
to
show
that
they
were
involved
in
that
decision.
they
knew
about
it.
they
intended
to
start
supplying
a
volume
market;
and
thereby
to
suggest
that
it
is
somehow
an
intervening
independent
decision--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--it
goes
to
show
that
this
court
should
not
grant
an
immunity
as
a
matter
of
law
because
in
this...
on
the
facts
of
this
case
you
have
a
seller
that
was
intentionally
trying
to
serve
a
market
by
secretly
giving
discounts.
it's
not
necessary
for
liability,
but
it
seems
to
me
it
is
if
you
were...
the
united
states
has
not
given
you
any
other
rules
you
should
put
in
here
except
absolute
immunity,
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
this
record
would
never
justify
immunity
because
you
had
a
seller
that
in
fact
was
intentionally
trying
to
get
this
price
to
large
chain
buyers.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
the
statute
doesn't
require
that
for
liability,
your
honor,
no.
it
only
requires
a
price
difference
that
affects
competition.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
justice
scalia,
the
way
i
read
our
brief
was
that
we
specifically
said
this
did
not
involve
general
wholesale
discounts,
that
it...
that
it
was
not'
the
case
that
had
been
presented--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--it's...
your
honor,
it
would
take
me
some
time
to
dig
it
out
of
the
respondent's
petition.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
yes.
we...
we
contended
that
there
was
a
basic
sham,
that
the
discount
was
just
a
conduit
to...
to
get
a
lower
price
to
the...
to
the
retail
class
of
trade.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
yes,
your
honor.
the...
even
if
that's
not
true,
the
only
defense
that
texaco
has...
has
suggested
to
you--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--even
if
the
mere
resale
of
a
product
would
say
someone
is
a
wholesaler.
in
other
words,
if
you
accept
the
government's
position,
the
functions
make
no
difference.
if
he
has
resold
the
product,
he's
a
wholesaler.
and
so
we...
we
said
that
what
he
was
doing
was
no
more
than
being
a
conduit,
but
if
you
accept
that
proposition
that
if
you
have
resold
the
product
you're
a
wholesaler,
then
you
must
consider
whether
that
as
a
matter
of
a
law
gives
you
an
immunity.
and
it
does
not.
and
that,
it
seemed
to
us,
was
the
question
you
granted
certiorari
on,
was
whether
a
wholesale
discount
that...
that
was
immune
as
a
matter
of
law
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
discount
was
justified
under
the
statute
or
whether
an
impact
of
competition.
in
this
case,
the
very
evil
that
congress
was
attempting
to
remedy
occurred.
large
chains
in
1971
in
spokane
in
the
spokane...
in
the
texaco
brand
received
lower
prices.
their
sales
soared
270
percent.
the
sales
at
the
stations
operated
by
my
clients
declined.
old,
favored
customers
who
purchased
business
volumes
of
gasoline
a
day
testified
that
they
stopped
doing
business
with
our
clients
because
of
the
price
difference.
that
information
was
put
on
by
10
or
15
witnesses.
an
example
was
a
man
named
leo
green
that
had
a
produce
company,
and
he
had
eight
or
ten
vehicles
that
he
was
using
one
of
my
clients
for.
he
stopped
buying
gasoline
there
because
of
a
3
to
5
cent
price
difference
between
the
stations
that
mr.
dompier
supplied
and
my
clients.
the
stations
supplied
by
mr.
dompier,
if
you
assume
he
was
a
wholesaler,
got
a
3.5
cent
discount
off
of
retail
tank
wagon,
and
when
they
opened
in
1971
the
price
was.7
of
a
cent
above
my
clients'
cost.
the
consequences
were
obvious.
by
the
end
of
the
damage
period,
eight
of
my
clients
were
out
of
business.
the
only
person
selling
texaco
gas
today
is
the
john
dompier
oil
company
of
spokane.
texaco
defended
this
case
as
a
matter
of
fact.
they...
they...
they
put
up
three
factual
defenses:
cost
justification;
meeting
competition,
both
of
which
were
rejected;
and
that
the
discount
did
not
affect
competition
because
the
services
would
have
eaten
up
the
discount.
they
were
all
rejected
by
the
jury.
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
if
one
needs
to
get
to
it,
clearly
supports
liability
in
this
case.
the
congress
was
asked
by
specific
language
to
exempt
discounts
based
upon
the
level
of
resale,
wholesaler,
wholesaler,
retailer,
retailer
and
rejected
it
in
the
1936--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--the
ninth
circuit
was
faced
with
this
argument.
texaco
could
not
justify
its
discount
based
upon
its
own
costs.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
it
could
not
justify
its
discount
based
upon
meeting
competition.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
and
it
could
not
justify
its
discount
on
the
basis
that
it
didn't
impact
competition
at
the
customer
level.
so
texaco
then
said
that,
well,
the
discount
was
eaten
up
by
the
cost
of...
to
the
favored
purchaser
and,
therefore,
it
didn't
affect
competition.
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
would
be
a
factual
matter
if
that
were
true,
and
you
didn't
prove
it
because
the
costs
that
you
say
would
have
been
eaten
up
were
not
performed.
there
was
nothing
there.
and
so
texaco
sort
of
created
this
issue
by
suggesting
that
factually
a
functional
discount
would
not
affect
competition.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
i
believe
this,
your
honor,
that...
that
the
determination
of
what
a
legitimate
functional
discount
is,
the
only
thing
being
presented
to
this
court
is
what
is
it
not,
and
it's...
it's
been
said
to
you
that
it's
not
a
discount
that
is
based
upon
the
buyer's
cost.
and
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
say
it
was
based
on
the
buyer's
cost.
they're
just
saying
that
if
that's
how
you
define
it,
you
didn't
prove
it.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
you
mean
would
basing
it
on
the
wholesaler's
cost
require
you
to--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--if...
if
you
are
not
justifying
a
discount
under
the
statute...
and
that
is,
you
couldn't
cost
justify,
you
weren't
meeting
competition,
then
all
you'd
be
trying
to
do
is
say,
well,
it
didn't
affect
competition
between
the
favored
and
disfavored
purchaser
or
their
customers,
and
the
inquiry
then
would
be,
what
costs
did
the
purchaser
have
that
would
have
eliminated
the
impact
on
competition.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
yes.
what
was
it
that
caused
you
to
give
him
this
discount
that...
that
you
contend
would
mean
that
it
does
not
impact
competition.
the
issue
has
not
been
really
given
to
you
as
to
what
is
a
legitimate
functional
discount,
at
least
by
the
government
or
by
texaco,
and
i
don't
believe
you
have
to
reach
that
because
of
a
narrow
issue
that
the
united
states
said
was
here,
which
is
the
knowing
passing
on
of
this
discount.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
no,
your
honor.
at
least
there's
two...
two
stages
you
have
to
get
through
before
you
get
there.
if...
if
texaco
had
a
difference
in
cost
of
dealing
with
the
wholesaler
of
4
cents
and
they
based
their
price
on
that,
then
if
he
was
able
to
pass
it
on
there'd
be
no
liability.
in
other
words,
if
he's
more
efficient
than
texaco,
then
there
is
no
liability
for
that...
that
discount
whatsoever.
if
competition
requires
them
to
do
that,
if
exxon
says
we're
giving
our
distributors
that
and
we'll
take
this
one
away
from
you,
then
there's
not
any
liability
even
if
it's
passed
on.
it's
only
when
they
give
a
discount
that
exceeds
their
own
cost
of
doing
the...
the
function
and
now
they're
paying
for
something
different
that
this
problem
could
ever
arise,
and
that
would
only--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--i...
i
would
not
say
it's
actionable,
your
honor.
it
may
result
in
an
inquiry.
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff
to
show
that
it
impacted
competition
and
then
show
that
it
proximately
caused
damage
to
him
is...
is
substantial.
that's
why
you
don't
see
any
of
these
cases
since
perkins
v.
standard
oil
in
1969.
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff
to
show
that
that
discount
impacted
competition
and
then
that
there
were
damage
is
extraordinary.
summary
judgments
are
given
routinely
on
that
basis.
the...
if
you
reach
the
issue
of
what
is
a
legitimate
functional
discount,
it
certainly
isn't
one
such
as
here
that...
that
the
defendant
admits
that
the
functions
were
not
performed
at
all.
the
amicus
brief
filed
by
35
states
tells
you
that
it's
cost-justified,
that
that
is
a
legitimate
functional
discount.
they
say
it's
administratively
easy
to
administer,
requires
no
sherman
act
problems,
and
that
would
be
what
is
a
legitimate
functional
discount.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
yes,
sir.
on
the
statutory
proviso
that
it
was
cost-justified,
it...
it's
legitimate.
the
texaco
wholesalers
who
were
the
ones
that
were
getting
the
discount
in
this
case
surprisingly
filed
a
brief
saying
the
same
thing;
and
that
is,
that
they
felt
that
the
only
functional
discount
that
was
valid
was
one
that
was
based
upon
the
savings
to
texaco
by
dealing
with
them;
that
anything
else
would
not
be
a
valid
functional
discount.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
if
the...
if
the
supplier
gave
a
price
difference
and
was
trying
to
justify
it
in
some
action,
the
wholesalers
say
that
their
defense
would
be
their
own
cost.
they
would
know
their
own
costs
of
distribution.
their
cost
savings
would
be
available
to
them.
they
could
easily
put
that
forward.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
well,
that
is
the...
the
statutory
harbor
for
a...
a
seller,
which
is
cost
justification
of
meeting
competition.
and
again,
they've
got
even
a
much
bigger
calm
water,
and
that
is
the
area
of
does
it
impact
competition.
it's
very
difficult
to
prove.
for
instance,
mr.
calvani
says
that
a
legitimate
functional
discount
is
cost-justified
plus
a
reasonable
profit.
if
that's
what
a
legitimate
functional
discount
is,
it
doesn't
apply
to
this
case,
but
if
that's
what
it
is,
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
prove
any
injury
of
meeting
competition...
excuse
me,
injury
to
yourself
or
to
competition
by
that
type
of
functional
discount.
texaco
and
the
government
are
contending
that
any
functional
discount,
25
cents,
50
cents,
is
legitimate.
if
the
court
finds
that
the...
as
a
matter
of
law
you
cannot
excuse
the
price
difference
in
this
case;
the
damages
in
this
case,
and
the
other
questions
upon
which
certiorari
were
granted,
really
fall
as
well.
the...
the
damage...
damages
sought
by
the
plaintiffs
were
only
those
damages
that
were
caused
to
them
by
the
discount
that
was
passed
through.
and
if
you
look
at
the
record,
there
was
a
period
of
time
when
mr.
dompier
at
the
encouragement
of
texaco
bought
these
stations,
and
the
method
he'd
use
was
to
raise
the
price
to
them
until
they
paid
retail
tank
wagon.
they
couldn't
compete
on
the
volume
level,
and
then
he
bought
them.
in
that
circumstance,
we
claim
no
damage
when
the
price
reduction
was
reduced
to
nothing
because
it
wasn't
being
passed
through
the
retail
level.
the
final
portion
of
the
damage
claim
that
was
challenged
by
texaco
pertained
to
how
did
this
court
mean
that
competition...
excuse
me,
that
a
violation-free
environment
would
be
tested.
in
j.
truett
payne,
you
said
that
a
plaintiff
can
recover
those
damages
that
they
would
have
not
suffered
had
there
been
no
violation;
in
other
words,
the
lost
sales
and
profits
they
would
have
had
had
there
been
no
violation
in
the
market.
texaco
had
a
number
of
ways
that
it
considered
eliminating
the...
the
violation,
one
of
which
was
to
raise
the
wholesaler's
price
some,
one
of
which
was
to
lower
the
retail
price
some,
and
one
is
to
do
a
combination
of
the
two.
the
jury
was
merely
given
a
number
of
calculations
based
upon
texaco's
own
methods
of
eliminating
the--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--no,
your
honor,
unless
it's
cost-justified.
this
court
rejected
that
specifically
in
morton
salt.
in
that
case,
they
tried
to
justify
the
discounts
because
the...
the
chains
were
buying
an
awful
lot
of...
of
salt,
and
this
court
specifically
and
congress
said
that's
not
a
good
enough
reason
to
discriminate
against
a
smaller
seller.
if
the
smaller
seller,
if
you
have
cost
savings
in
dealing
with
the...
the
volume
buyer,
then
it's
okay.
in
conclusion,
under
the
first
issue
that
you
granted
certiorari
on,
i
don't
believe
you
can
reverse
this
verdict
without
finding
as
a
matter
of
law
that
a
legitimate
functional
discount
is
not
judged
by
any
facts.
it's
merely
judged
by
the
fact
that
it's
given
to
someone
that's
nominated
a
wholesaler
regardless
of
the
functions
that
have
been
performed.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
i
would
contend
that
it's
violated
even
if
the--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--the
court
could
do
that,
but
it
would
be
inconsistent--
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
--with
the
court's
own
opinion
in
the
fred
meyer
v.
ftc,
and
that
is
where
you
had
a
promotional
allowance
that
was
given
to
a
retailer
but
not
a
wholesaler
that
was
then,
this
court
said
that
you
could
not
avoid
the
prescriptions
of
the
robinson-patman
act
merely
because
the
wholesaler
and
the
retailer
didn't
compete
with
each
other.
that
would
certainly
give
a
huge
loophole,
it
would
be
a
truck
through
which
one
could
drive
to
avoid
the
robinson-patman
act.
where
you
wanted
to
sell
to
a
retailer
at
a
lower
price,
all
you
would
need
to
do
is
put
another
link
in
the
chain
and
sell
at
a
lower
price
to
that
link
and
have
it
passed
on.
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
perkins
v.
perkins.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
yes,
sir.
in
conclusion,
as
i
said,
the
robinson-patman
act's
language
and
its
legislative
history
and
its
policy
were
designed
to
protect
the
small
retailer
such
as
i
represent
in
this
case.
the
legitimate
functional
discount
has
to
be
viewed
by
the
statutory
language
of
either
cost
justification
meeting
competition
or
effect
on
competition
and
injury.
it
cannot
be
given
a
per
se
immunity.
the
other
issues
involved
in
the
case
really
fall
if
that
issue
falls.
the
morton
salt
argument
has
not
been
properly
preserved.
if
it
had
been
properly
preserved,
it's
a
proper
statement
of
the
law
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
this
verdict,
after
two
trials,
two
trips
to
the
ninth
circuit,
a
petition
for
certiorari
here
that
was
denied
nine
years
ago,
and
this
current
petition
should
stand.
texaco's
defenses
were
nothing
but
a
flimsy
piece
of
paper,
and
this
court
should
not
accept
them.
mr.
robert
h.
whaley
thank
you.
