mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
below
held
texaco
liable
for
violation
of
2a
of
the
robinson-patman
act
for
engaging
in
an
age-old
practice,
indeed
one
which
is
economically
necessary,
of
selling
to
wholesalers
at
a
lower
price
than
it
sold
to
retailers
on
the
condition...
on
two
conditions:
one,
that
the
wholesale
discount
was
not
calibrated
just
to
meet
the
wholesaler's
cost
of
wholesaling;
and--
two,
that
the
wholesaler,
who
was
an
independent
business
entity,
made
an
independent
decision
to
pass
some
of
that
discount
on
to
its
retailers;
i.e.,
it
sold
its
retailers
at
a
price
that
was
different
from
texaco's
direct
sale
to
its
retailers.
the
plaintiffs
who
recovered
damages
for
this
are
12
retail
service
stations
in
spokane,
washington.
they
were
awarded
treble
damages
during
a
period
january
1972
through
april
1981,
based
on
texaco's
sales
to
dompier
oil
company,
a
wholesaler,
at
a
higher
price
than
it
sold
directly
to
the
plaintiff
retailers.
the
record
shows
that
dompier
purchased
gasoline
from
texaco
at
the
standard
wholesale
discount
off
the
retail
tank
wagon
price
that
texaco
gave
to
all
its
wholesalers
in
the
washington
and
oregon
territory.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
well,
the
record
indicates
that
there
were
two
wholesalers
in
spokane
and
a
substantial
number
throughout
the
states.
i
don't
know
the
exact
number,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
there
was
a
nonbranded
wholesaler
in
spokane
and
one
branded
wholesaler.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
no,
your
honor.
dompier,
which
is
the
wholesaler
at
issue
here,
during
part
of
the
period
of
damages,
sold
only
at
wholesale.
during
part
of
the
period
and
a
later
period
it
sold
both
at
wholesale
and
at
retail.
your
honor,
the
way
the
damages
were
advanced
by
the
plaintiffs
here
is
they
took
four
retail
stations
in
spokane,
and
the
damages
were
based
exclusively
on
the
effect
of
the
consumer
sales
from
these
four
stations
as
they
affected
the
plaintiff
stations.
those
four
were
all
dompier-supplied
stations.
the
record
is
clear
that
during
the
beginning
of
the
damage
period,
from
january
1972
through
july
'74,
each
of
those
four
stations
was
an
independent
retailer,
had
no
direct
relationship
with
dompier,
and
dompier
bought
and
then
made
an
independent
price
decision
to
sell
to
those
four
retail
stations.
they,
in
turn,
made
an
independent
price
decision
as
to
what
price
to
charge
the
consumer.
so
that
for
part
of
the
damage
period,
dompier
acted
exclusively
as
a
wholesaler
and
not
a
retailer,
and
the
only
damages
claimed
by
plaintiffs
for
that
part
of
the
damage
period
were
the
sales
from
dompier
to
these
four
stations.
that
is
why
the
district
court,
in
footnote
4
of
its
opinion,
specifically
said
prior
to
1974
dompier
oil
company
did
not
operate
any
retail
stations
but
as
a
distributor
sold
texaco
gasoline
to
retail
stations.
now,
your
honor--
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
--no,
your
honor.
the
issue
for
the
time
when
dompier
was
acting
as
a...
both
a
wholesaler
and
a
retailer
is
an
issue
that's
been
much
debated
within
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
courts
of
appeals
which
has
been
recently
discussed
in
judge
starr's
opinion
in
boise
cascade.
it
goes
back
to
the
ftc's
opinions
in
doubleday
and
mueller,
and
it's
a
question
of
when...
when
an
entity
is
performing
both
functions,
what
kind
of
a
discount
or
what
kind
of
a
lower
price
can
the
supplier
give?
does
it
have
to
cover
only
the
retail
functions?
can
it...
can
it
give
the
wholesale
discount
for
all
sales
even
though
some
of
them
are
on
retail?
that's
an
issue
that
is
being
much
debated
in
the
lower
courts
and
the
trade
commission
now
which
would
have
to
be
resolved
as
to
the
period
subsequent
to
1974.
but
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court
because
that
wasn't
addressed
in
the
ninth
circuit
opinion.
that
would
have
to
be
an
issue
that
the
lower
courts
would
have
to
deal
with
on
remand
if
the
ninth
circuit
decision
is
reversed.
the
issue
that
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
presents
to
this
court,
because
that's
the
way
the
case
was
tried
and
that's
the
way
the
record
that
clearly
is
the
part
of
the
damage
period
is
directly
assailed
to
an
entity
dompier
is
exclusively
a
wholesaler
and
makes
an
independent
decision
to
sell
to
its
retailers
at
a
certain
price.
that
is
the
issue
before
the
court,
and
that's
the
issue
we
suggest
the
ninth
circuit
departed
from
logic
and
economics
and
precedent
when
it
said
that
alone
is
sufficient
to
create
a
liability
under
section
2a.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
yes.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
that's
correct.
that's
the
standard
morton
salt
instruction.
what
my
client
did
object
to,
your
honor,
was
instruction
23(a)
which
converted
the
morton
salt
inference
as
it
was
enunciated
by
this
court
in
morton
salt
into
a
very
different
inference
because
instruction
23(a)
told
the
jury
that
dompier,
in
effect,
would
be
in
competition
with
the
plaintiffs
if
any
of
dompier's
customers
were
in
competition
with
the
plaintiffs.
so
when
you
take
instruction
20
and
23(a)
together,
what
the
jury
was
instructed
is
that
the
discriminatory
price,
the
price
difference
between
dompier
as
a
wholesaler
and
the
plaintiffs
as
a
retailer
itself
and
alone
would
justify
the
morton
salt
inference
because
dompier's
customers,
not
dompier,
was
in
competition
with
the
plaintiffs.
now
it's
our
position...
and,
of
course,
the
ninth
circuit
dealt
with
the
morton
salt
inference
rather
extensively
in
its
opinion,
and
it's
our
position,
your
honor,
that
that
is
a
misapplication
of
the
morton
salt
inference.
in
effect,
what
that
does
is
convert
a
traditional
time-honored,
economically
required
policy
of
selling
to
a
wholesaler
at
a
lower
price
than
a
retailer
into
an
automatic
inference
that
that
in
itself
effects
competition
at
the
retail
level,
whereas
morton
salt,
of
course,
was
a
sale
by
a
seller
to
two
competing
buyers
who
were
competing
with
each
other.
now
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
it's
self-evident
that
if
over
a
substantial
period
of
time
a
seller
is
selling
to
two
competing
buyers
at
substantially
different
prices
that
that
is
going
to
affect
the
competition
between
them.
it's
wholly
different,
as
the
ninth
circuit
did
in
this
case,
and
as
the
jury
instructions
required
the
jury
to
do,
to
say
that
when
a
wholesaler...
when
a
retailer,
a
supplier
sells
to
a
wholesaler
at
one
price
and
a
retailer
at
a
lower
price,
that
that
in
itself
said
that
it
self-evidently
is
going
to
affect
competition
between
the
wholesalers,
retailers
and
the
direct
buying
retail.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
there
are
two
parts
of
the
robinson-patman
act
language
that
don't
apply
in
this
instance,
your
honor.
one
is,
as
you
pointed
out,
it
has
to
be
the
person,
i.e.
texaco,
has
to
discriminate
in
price.
it's
our
position
that
this
is
not
a
discrimination
because,
when
you
charge
different
prices
to
people
at
different
levels
of
the
distribution
chain,
that
is
not
a
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
the
robinson-patman
act.
our
second
argument--
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
--well,
justice
stevens,
i'm
sure
that
you're
aware,
the
principal
authority
you're
dealing
with
at
this
point
is
this
court's
opinion
in
anheuser-busch,
which
is
its
opinion
by
justice
warren
quite
some
time
ago
which
has
discouraged
lower
courts
from
applying
this
literally.
it's
our
position
in
this
case
that
anheuser-busch,
while
it
has
language
in
it
that
says
a
difference
is
a
discrimination,
is
totally
distinguishable
from
this
case
and
shouldn't
be
applied--
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
--well,
"customers
or
either
of
them"
is
a
different
issue,
your
honor.
under
the
robinson-patman
act,
as
i
was
saying
to
chief
justice
rehnquist,
there
are
two
requirements
and
the
language
of
the
act
before
it
applies.
one
is
there
has
to
be
a
discrimination.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
the
second,
that
discrimination
has
to
affect
competition.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
that's
where
the
"customers
of
either"
come
in.
it
can
affect
competition
of
the
customers
of
either.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
there
are
two
reasons
why
we
say
that
this
practice
doesn't
come
under
the
language.
one
is
discrimination,
and
the
other
is
it's
not
the
discrimination
between
the
wholesaler
and
the
retailer
that
has
the
effect
on
competition
down
at
the
lower
level.
in
a
case
like
this,
where
you
have
different
prices
at
different
levels
and
you
have
an
independent
wholesaler,
it's
that
separate
decision
by
the
independent
wholesaler
what
to
charge
his
retailers
that
it
causes
the
impact
on
competition.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
where
it
would
be
violated?
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
at
the
second
level?
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
well,
your
honor,
it
is
our
position
that
where
you...
where
you
have
a
difference
in
price
it's
not
between
people
of
the
same
level,
two
wholesalers
or
two
retailers,
but
if
people
in
different
distribution
levels--
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
--it
does
not
violate
the
standard.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
if
there
was
a
sham
or
a
pass-on
agreement
or
a
supplier
set
up
a
wholesaler
and
required
him
to
pass
on
or
it
was
a
phony
situation
where
he
was
using
that
to
pass
on--
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
knowledge
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case
based
on
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
and...
and
the
instructions
below.
beyond
that,
it's
our
position
that
knowledge
is
irrelevant
to
this
issue
and
is
not
of
material
fact
because
knowledge
doesn't
add
anything.
if
the
difference
at
the
two
levels
is
not
a
discrimination,
then
knowledge
is
irrelevant,
and
if
it
is
the
independent
decision
of
the
wholesaler
that
causes
the
effect
on
competition,
knowledge
that
the
wholesaler
is
going
to
do
that
on
behalf
of
the
supplier
is
also
irrelevant.
another
way
to
answer
that
question,
your
honor,
is
to
ask,
what
could
the
supplier
do
if
it
has
a
dual
channel
distribution
system
and
it
is
selling
to
a
wholesaler
at
a
price
that
presumably
covers
his
cost
and
provides
for
a
profit
and
that
wholesaler
is
aggressive
and
either
is
taking
lower
margins
than
other
wholesalers
or
is
willing
for
a
period
of
time
to
try
to
expand
its
business
and
is
selling
by
passing
on
the
discount.
given
the
facts
like
this
situation,
where
the
wholesaler
is
an
independent
entity
and
the
supplier
is
not
engaging
in
vertical
price
maintenance
and
the
wholesaler
has
the
right
to
make
those
decisions,
knowledge
doesn't
help
the
supplier
at
all.
there's
nothing
the
supplier
can
do
to
prevent
that
other
than
to
cut
out
the
wholesalers
or
cut
out
the
retailers,
which
is
not
what
this
statute
is
designed
to
bring
about.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
well,
there
might
be.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
that
it's
relevant
to
this.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
yes,
that's
right.
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
yes.
when
a
supplier
sells
to
a
wholesaler,
it
sets
that...
that
price
presumably
based
on
what
it
has
to
pay
in
a
competitive
market
to
get
the
wholesaler
to
do
the
work,
plus
it
has
to
add
enough
on
so
the
wholesaler
will
have
a
profit
which
will
encourage
the
wholesaler
to
carry
out
those
functions.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
well,
your
honor--
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
--your
honor,
again,
in
this
case
the
damages
are
based
solely
on
the
activities
of
dompier.
there's
no
question
that
until
the
middle
of
1974
dompier
was
exclusively
a
wholesaler.
we
know
he
was
a
wholesaler.
subsequently,
he
was
both
a
wholesaler
and
a
retailer.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
no.
that
is
what
the
d.c.
circuit
has
been
grappling
with
in
boise
cascade,
that
one
has
to
separate
out
the
wholesale
and
the
retail
functions
and
make
a
determination
as
to
what
kind
of
price
discounts
can
be
given
overall
for
each
one.
but
that
is
clearly
not
our
case
in
the
period
through
the
middle
of
1974,
and
since
the
plaintiffs'
damage
evidence
consisted
of
a
single
damage
number
for
each
plaintiff
through
the
entire
period,
and
there
was
no
evidence
presented
or
no
way
the
jury
or
anybody
else
could
break
out
the
damage
during
various
subsets
of
this
period,
necessarily
part
of
the
damages
that
the
jury
found
was
for
this
period
from
january
1972
through
july
of
1974,
and
necessarily
that
depended
on
a
legal
conclusion
that
it
was
a
violation
of
the
act
for
texaco
to
sell
to
dompier
exclusively
as
a
wholesaler.
therefore,
if
that
proposition
of
law
that
the
ninth
circuit
enunciated
is
incorrect,
this...
this
judgment
has
to
be
reversed.
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
m.
fishbein
to
get
to
justice
stevens'
earlier
question
about
the
premise
of
this
case,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
undisputed
that
the
only
damages
on
which
the
plaintiffs
have
asserted
bases
for
damages
are
the
sales
by
four
stations
which
are
supplied
exclusively
by
dompier.
therefore,
if
the
sales
to
dompier
are
not
illegal,
the
damages
for
the
early
damage
period
for
the
middle
of
1974
cannot
stand.
since
the
damage
evidence
was
presented
from
a
whole
period
without
breakout,
the
entire
judgment
cannot
stand
if
the
sales
to
dompier
solely
as
a
wholesaler
as
an...
who
independently
then
sold
to
his
retailers,
it
did
not
violate
the
robinson-patman
act.
in
terms
of
the
post-1974
period,
we
do
not
agree
that
it
is
automatically
unlawful
for
a
supplier
to
give
a
wholesale
discount
to
someone
at
the
lower
level
who
operates
both
as
a
wholesaler
and
a
retailer.
the
case
was
not
presented
to
the
jury
or
tried
on
that
basis.
mr.
whaley,
in
his
arguments
to
the
jury
at
the
close,
said
specifically...
it's
cited
in
our
brief...
it
doesn't
matter
if
dompier
operated
these
stations
directly
or
was
selling
to
them
independently.
he
had
the
same
theory,
which
was
if
there's
a
pass-through,
there's
a
violation.
therefore,
the
jury
was
never
instructed,
the
court
never
dealt
with
the,
the
district
court
in
the
ninth
circuit
never
discussed
the
boise
cascade
issue
which
that
would
deal
with,
and
the
case
has
to
be
remanded
for
that
reason.
finally,
what's
really
at
stake
here
is
the
fact
that
anytime
a
supplier
deals
with
wholesalers
and
retails
in
a
dual
channel
of
distribution,
it
must
charge
a
high...
a
lower
price
to
the
wholesaler;
otherwise,
the
wholesaler
will
not
be
in
business.
it
cannot
monitor
the
costs
of
the
wholesaler.
the
reason
for
the
wholesale
discount
is
not
to
compensate
for
any
particular
functions.
it's
a
market
idea.
it's
a
free
market.
it's
the
supplier's
concept
of
what
he
has
to
pay
to
the
wholesaler
to
induce
the
wholesaler
to
engage
in
those
functions
and
up
to
the
point
where
the
wholesaler
is
giving
value.
there's
no
way
of
getting
around
that.
