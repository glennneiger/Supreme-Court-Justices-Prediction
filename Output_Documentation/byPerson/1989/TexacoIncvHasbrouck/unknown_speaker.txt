unknown
speaker
mr.
fishbein,
how
many
wholesalers
were
there
in
the
territory?
unknown
speaker
but
does
the
record
show
there
were
any
others
in
the
same
competitive
market?
unknown
speaker
so
there
are...
there
are
two?
unknown
speaker
that...
that
set
the
standard.
and
both
of
them
also
sold
at
retail,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
would...
would
you
concede
liability
for
the
time
when
dompier
was
acting
as
a
retailer?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fishbein,
i
think
i
understand
that
the
jury
was
given
an
instruction
at
trial,
number
20,
which
told
the
jury
that
it
could
infer
the
likelihood
of
injury
to
competition
from
evidence
that
texaco
had
discriminated
in
price
in
the
sale
of
gasoline
between
different
purchasers
who
were
in
competition
with
each
other
and
that
the
price
difference
was
substantial
and
it
lasted
for
a
substantial
period
of
time,
the
so-called
morton
salt
type
instruction.
unknown
speaker
you
may...
your
client
did
not
object
to
that
instruction,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
fishbein,
the
robinson-patman
act
does
prohibit
discrimination
in
price
between
different
purchasers
of
commodities
of
like
grade
and
quality.
now
what
was
it
about
this
case
that
prevented
that
language
from
applying
to
your
client?
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
you
think
there's...
is
there
something
then
invidious
in
the
notion
that
the
word
"discriminate"
conveys?
certainly,
ordinarily
"discriminate"
means
to
differentiate.
your
honor,
in
an
oft-quoted
statement
by
representative
utterbach,
who
was
the
conference
sponsor
of
the
robinson-patman
act,
he
pointed
out
that
discrimination
means
a
difference
or
a
differentiation
only
in
those
circumstances
where
the
two
people
being
differentiated
have
some
reason
or
some
justification
to
be
treated
the
same.
any
difference
doesn't
automatically
mean
a
discrimination.
the
normal
english
language
use
of
discrimination
seems
to
us
to
mean
something
more
than
just
a
difference.
it
means
a
difference
in
a
circumstance
where
you
would
expect
or
require
equal
treatment.
now
that's
certainly
true
when
you
have
a
supplier
selling
to
two
buyers
who
are
at
the
same
level
in
competing
with
each
other.
we
suggest
it's
certainly
not
true
where
you
have
a
supplier
selling
on
one
hand
to
a
wholesaler,
on
the
other
hand
to
a
retailer
who
are
at
two
different
levels.
mr.
fishbein,
how
many
courts
have
adopted
this
theory
that
you're...
it's
not
a
discrimination?
i
know
that
everybody's
heard
congressman
utterbach's
comment
for
50
years,
but
what...
what's
the
principal
judicial
decision
that
says
a
mere
price
difference
is
not
a
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand
you
can
distinguish
all
or
most
of
these
cases,
but
i
was
just
wondering.
most
of...
most...
most
of
the
cases
seem
to
say
a
price
differential
is
a...
is
a
discrimination
but
it's
not
unlawful
unless
it
has
the
adverse
impact
on
competition
at
either
the
first,
second
or
third
level.
and
you...
and
why
aren't
you
also
troubled
by
the
language,
"customers
or
either
of
them"?
unknown
speaker
correct.
unknown
speaker
correct.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
case
in
which
the
statute
would
be
violated
at
the
second
level?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
where
you
have
substantial
price
difference
between
the
prices
charged
to
a
wholesaler
and
a
retailer,
could
that
ever
adversely
affect
competition
between
the
two
customers
or
customers
of
either...
either
of
them?
unknown
speaker
you
say
if
they're
different...
different
functional
levels,
it
never
violates
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
what
if
there
was
an
agreement,
pass-on
agreement?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about...
what
about
knowledge
over
a
long
period
that
the
pass-on
was
being
given?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
you
could
also
say
there's
an
independent
retailer?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
an
independent
retailer
might
not
pass
it
on.
unknown
speaker
he
might
prefer
a
profit.
unknown
speaker
mr.
fishbein,
how
do
we
know
who's
a
wholesaler
and
who's
a
retailer?
unknown
speaker
and
certainly
in
this
case
there
was
some...
i
guess
gull
and
dompier
were
doing
both?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
if
we
had
that
subsequent
situation
in
front
of
us,
how
do
you
distinguish?
i
mean,
your
rule
couldn't
apply.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
fishbein.
mr.
dreeben.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
is
this
some
sentence
or
paragraph
of
the
robinson-patman
act
that
the
federal
trade
commission
has
interpreted
to
reach
this
conclusion?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
identify
a
legitimate
functional
discount?
unknown
speaker
did
the
wholesaler
here
satisfy
that
test?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
what
about
the
latter
period?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
there
was
a
violation
of
law
during
the
latter
period?
unknown
speaker
but
under
your
test,
would--
unknown
speaker
--so
you
agree
that
at
least
as
to
liability
for
a
part
of
the
period,
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed?
unknown
speaker
and
specifically
what
error
was
made
in
the
trial
court,
in
your
view,
if
any?
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
view
there
was
a...
a
necessary
instruction
was
omitted,
or
was
there
any
error
in
the
instructions
that
were
given?
unknown
speaker
was
any
of
the
instructions,
in
your
view,
erroneous?
unknown
speaker
which
one?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
at
the
petition
stage,
i
thought
the
brief
of
the
solicitor
general
said
they
thought
that
they
were
acting
as
retailers
during
that
early
period,
and
the
position
taken
by
the
solicitor
general
in
the
brief
at
that
stage
is
quite
different
than
what
it
is
now.
unknown
speaker
i
would
appreciate
it
if
you
would.
unknown
speaker
did
the...
did
the
defendant
tender
instruction
which
would
have
required
them
to
break
out
those
two
periods?
unknown
speaker
no,
that's
not
my
question.
unknown
speaker
there's
a
material
legal
difference
between
the
two
periods
of
time.
unknown
speaker
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
size
of
the
discount
and
its
duration
and
effects
would
ever
matter?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
you...
you
answered
the
chief
justice,
but...
i
mean,
you
said
it
but
i
don't
understand
why
it's
so.
you
say
that
the
word
"effect"
of
such
a
discrimination,
you
say
that
it
has
no
effect
of
injuring
the
customers
of...
why
doesn't
it
have
an
effect
of
injuring
the
customers
of
the
seller
if
you
sell
it
to
a
wholesaler
at
a
lower
price
who
can
thereafter
sell
it
at
a
lower
price
to
other
customers
of
his
who
compete
with
customers
of
yours?
unknown
speaker
that's...
that's
the
same
case
when
you...
when
you
sell
it
to
two
individual
people
who
then
resell.
i
mean,
that
happens
often.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
relying
on
the
language
then.
you're
just
telling
me,
you
know,
effect
doesn't
mean
effect.
unknown
speaker
maybe...
maybe
congress
only
wanted
to
foster
such
discounts
to
the
extent
that
the
discounts
take
into
account
the
function
that
the
distribution
system
performs,
which
means
to
the
extent
that
they're
properly
price
based.
unknown
speaker
finish
answering
the
question.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
whaley,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
whaley?
unknown
speaker
not
the
appendix?
unknown
speaker
xxx
that
you
rely
on
especially
for
your
position?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
closest?
unknown
speaker
was
that
after
'74?
unknown
speaker
the
letter
was
after
1974?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
is
it
true
that
the
district
court
found
that
dompier
was
selling
only
as
a
wholesaler
prior
to
july
'74?
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
the
finding
of
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
can
we
accept
it
as
a
fact
that
they
were
acting
only
as
wholesalers
during
that
interval
of--
unknown
speaker
--based
on
this
record?
unknown
speaker
dompier?
unknown
speaker
well,
be
that
as
it
may,
may
we
accept
that
as
a
given
in
our
resolution
of
it?
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
i'm
just
a
little
unclear
to
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor.
do
you
say
that
the
question
whether
the...
if
it
was
a
mixed
function
for
both
gull
and
dompier
was...
there
was...
there
was
a
dispute
between
the
parties
on
that
issue
for
the
entire
period?
unknown
speaker
then...
then
doesn't
your
answer
have
to
be
that
no,
we
cannot
assume
there
was
a
period
in
which
it
was
exclusively
a
wholesaler?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
so
that
we
cannot
accept
as
a
fact
the
essential
predicate
of
your
opponent's
argument
is
what--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
jury
made
no
finding
on
it,
and
the
district
judge
didn't...
didn't
assume
that
the
jury
made
a
finding
on
it?
unknown
speaker
there
were
no
interrogatories.
unknown
speaker
aren't
you
saying
this
is...
that
this
is
just
sort
of
a
sham
wholesaler?
unknown
speaker
cost-justified
by
what?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose...
suppose
that
you
did
show
that?
to
what
legal
theory
does
that
go?
knowledge
isn't
required,
is
it,
for
a
violation
here?
unknown
speaker
well...
well...
well,
how
do
you
formulate
the
legal
theory
that
makes
that
inquiry
relevant?
what
do
we...
what
do
we...
what
does
that
go
to
show?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
is
there
anything
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
justifies
that?
unknown
speaker
xxx
ask
you
about
what
you
were
saying
before
about...
about
whether
these
people
were
wholesalers
or
not.
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
we're
concerned
about
here
certainly
discussed
the
case
as
though
it
involved
a
case
of
sales
to
wholesalers.
we
recognize
that
generally
selling
at
different
prices
to
customers
who
at
different
levels
of
distribution...
who
are
at
different
levels
will
not
constitute
a
violation,
blah
blah
blah,
and
then
they
go
on
to
analyze
that.
the
question
presented
by
your
opponent
in
this
case
was
whether
the
robinson-patman
act
is
violated
by
selling
to
wholesalers
at
a
lower
price.
your
opposition
to
that
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
as...
as
i
read
it,
did
not
come
in
and
say
this
is
not
a
case
involving
sales
to
wholesalers,
and
now
you're
raising
this...
this
issue
for
the
first
time
here,
as
far
as
i
can
understand
it,
telling
us
that
we...
we
have
before
us
a
case
quite
different
from
what
we...
what
we
thought
we
had.
unknown
speaker
general
wholesale
discounts,
but
i...
i'd
like
to
know
the
part
of
it
where
you
say
that
these
individuals
who
got
the
discounts
were
not
wholesalers.
i
don't
see
it.
unknown
speaker
are
you
sure
it's
in
there?
unknown
speaker
contended
that
in
your
response,
your
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
even
if
what's
not
true?
unknown
speaker
mr.
whaley,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
can't
seem
to
find
it
in
the
opinion
right
now,
but
there
was
a
good
deal
of
argument
to
the
effect
that
the
rule
the
ninth
circuit
laid
down,
or
seemed
to
be
laying
down,
was
that
one
of
the
important
elements
of
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
the
discount
was
justified
by
the
costs
of
the
wholesaler,
not
the
costs
of
the
seller,
and
that...
that
in
order
to
show
that
it
was
unlawful,
the
plaintiff
had
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
wholesaler's
cost
somehow
didn't
justify
it.
do
you...
first
of
all,
do
you
agree
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
either
said
or
held;
and
secondly,
do
you
think
that's
correct?
what
relevance,
of
any,
is
the...
are
the
costs
of
the
wholesaler?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
whether...
whether
texaco
created
it
or
you
created
it,
do
you
think
it
is...
that
the
ninth
circuit,
there
are
portions
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
that
can
be
read
to
indicate
that
that
is
a
relevant
test
in
determining
whether
a
functional
discount
is
lawful
or
not?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
is
that
the
same
as
basing
it
on
the
wholesaler's
cost...
the
same
thing
as
inquiring
about
what
services
the
wholesaler
performs?
unknown
speaker
no.
would...
would
you
be
saying
the
same
thing
if
you
say
that,
well,
to
justify
the
discount
you
have
to
at
least
show
what
services
the
wholesaler
performed?
unknown
speaker
and
which...
and
i
suppose
to
figure
his
costs
you'd
have
to
figure
out
what
he
was
doing?
unknown
speaker
what
functions
he
was
performing
in
the
distribution
chain.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
suppose
in
your
position
the...
any
functional,
any
discount
to
a
wholesaler
that
is
passed
on
that
affects
competition
is
going
to
be
actionable.
unknown
speaker
unless
they
can
cost
justify
within
the
means
of
the
statute
or
meet...
or
prove
you
have
to
meet
competition,
any
discount
that
is
passed
on
is
actionable.
unknown
speaker
well,
costs
justified
in
that
sense
would
be
relying
on
the
language
of
the
statutory
proviso,
then,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
something
that
would
have
to
be
proved
in
every
case,
the
amount
of
the...
the
amount
of
the
savings
to
the
supplier?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
could
put
it
forward.
one
might
question
how
easily.
unknown
speaker
is
a...
is
a
discount
for
a
wholesaler
ever
justified
just
because
he
buys
a
lot
of
volume
at
discount?
unknown
speaker
xxx
on
who
isn't
competing
with
the
plaintiff.
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
would,
but
the...
the
position
to
reverse...
you,
you
could
just
say
if
it's
given
to
someone
who
isn't
competing
with
the
plaintiff,
then
there's
no
violation.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
in
perkins.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
whaley.
unknown
speaker
mr.
fishbein,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
