mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mark
howlett
brought
an
action
under
title
42,
section
1983,
the
federal
civil
rights
act
of
1873.
the
defendants
were
the
school
board
of
pinellas
county,
florida
and
designated
officials
of
that
school
board.
the
action
charged
two
offenses:
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
due
process
clause
and
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
allegation
with
respect
to
the
fourth
amendment
was
that
the
assistant
principal
of
the
high
school
at
which
mark
howlett
was
a
student
broke
into
his
automobile
while
the
automobile
was
lawfully
parked
on
the
school
ground.
the
second
charge
of...
of
violation
of
due
process
was
that
in
the
ensuing
suspension,
which
he
received
for
five
days,
the
due
process,
as
ordained
by
this
court,
was
not
granted.
the
circuit
court
of
pinellas
county,
florida
is
a
court
of
general
jurisdiction
in
which
this
action
was
brought.
the
circuit
court
of
pinellas
county
dismissed
the
action
on
two
grounds.
the
first
ground
was
that
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
state
of
florida
barred
the
action.
the
second
ground
was
that
the
administrative
remedies
had
not
been
exhausted.
on
appeal,
the
district
court
of
appeals
of
the
second
district
of
florida
affirmed
on
the
first
ground
and
did
not
reach
the
second
ground,
the
first
ground
being
that
there
was
a
want
of
jurisdiction
because
of
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
school
board.
under
florida
law,
the
school
board
is
immune
from
suit.
the
question
presented,
therefore,
is
whether
or
not
the
school
board
is
immune
under
federal
law.
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
with
one
justice
dissenting,
denied
review,
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
the
first
question
to
be
addressed
is
simply
the
fact
that
the
broad
ground
on
which
the
district
court
of
appeal
of
florida
affirmed
the
dismissal
is,
as
a
matter
of
law,
incorrect.
namely,
that
whether
or
not
jurisdiction
exists
when
a
state
court
exercises
or
attempts
to
exercise
jurisdiction
under
1983
is
solely
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
that
because
we
think
there's
an
intermediate
ground
in
which
this
court
has
taken
the
position
that
where
the
suit
brought
on
a
federal
claim
is
a
claim
which
is
within
a
class
of
claims
that
the
state
customarily
exercises
jurisdiction
over.
then,
even
without
addressing
the
question
of
whether
the
state
would
have
to
do
it
by
direction
of
congress,
they
would
have
to
do
it
simply
because
it
is
within
a
class
of
claims
which
the
state
does
entertain.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
not
against
the
state
of
florida,
your
honor,
because
one
of
the
distinctions
to
be
made
is
that
although
the
school
board
is
immune
from
suit
under
florida
law,
it
is
not
immune
from
suit
under
the
rulings
of
this
court
under
1983.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
if
your
honor
please,
going
back
to
claflin
against
houseman,
an
1876
case
in
which
justice
bradley
rendered
the
opinion
of
the
court,
the
claim
there
was
based
on
a...
an
assignment
in
bankruptcy.
the
state
court
refused
to
entertain
it
on
the
ground
that
the
assignment
in
bankruptcy
was
solely
a
matter
of
federal
law.
in
a
rather
elaborate
opinion,
justice
bradley
explained
that
because
of
the
dual
nature
of
our
court
system
and
the
dual
nature
of
the
laws
of
this
country,
that
it...
the
state
court
was
required
to
entertain
the
action,
an
assignment
in
bankruptcy,
because
it
routinely
handled
assignments
in
other
matters.
in
other
words,
the
mere
fact
that
it
was
an
assignment
from
federal
law
was
not
a
reason
to
deny
the
claim.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
florida,
your
honor,
has
a
general
statute
which
abolishes
or
waives
the
statutory
immunity
of
the
state
and
its
agencies
in
all
tort
claims
except
tort
claims
involving
so-called
discretion
or
discretionary
acts.
it...
there
have
been
a
number
of
rulings,
including
a
ruling
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
that
this
general
waiver
of
tort
liability
does
not
extend
to
constitutional
torts
under
1983.
and
thus,
we
have
the
juxtaposition
which
your
honor
is
inquiring
about,
a
general
release
of
authority,
a
general
waiver
with
respect
to
torts,
but
as
to
constitutional
torts,
no
waiver.
that's
the...
that's
the
general
set-up.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
not
by...
not
in
the
legislature.
there
are
one
or
two
cases
where
the
florida
supreme
court
has
ruled
that
a
denial
of
due
process
can
be
of
such
a
nature
that
even
though
there
is
no
provision
under
state
law,
it
simply
will
not
be
allowed.
one
other
point
i'd
like
to
make,
your
honor,
in
connection
with
that,
is
that
in
owen
against
the
city
of
independence
this
court
established
the
rule
that
there
is
no
discretion
to
violate
the
constitution.
and
so
anticipating
the
argument
in
the...
which
we
have
received
in
the
brief
from
the
opposition,
one
of
the
arguments
is
that
the
discretionary...
the
discretionary
exception
to
the
waiver
covers
this
case.
we
maintain
that
it
does
not
because
of
this
court's
position
in
owen,
simply
that
it's
not
constitutionally
permissible
to
violate
the
constitution.
therefore,
there
cannot
be
any
discretion
in
that
area.
consequently,
the
general
waiver
also
has
to
include
this
class
of
cases
unless
there
is
going
to
be
a
discrimination
against
federal
law.
another
case
illustrating
the
same
point
is
mondou
against
new
york,
a
1912
case,
under
the
federal
employees
liability
act.
there
the
state
of
new
york
refused
to
enforce
the
fela
simply
because
it
was
contrary
to
the
policy
of
the
state
of
new
york.
this
said
that...
this
court
said
that
any
exception
to
enforcement
must
depend
on
some
outside
reason.
it
may
not
depend
on
simply
a
dislike
of
the
cause
of
action.
in
mcknett
against
san
francisco
and...
st.
louis
and
san
francisco
railway,
a
1984
decision
written
by
justice
brandeis,
the
operative
provisions
of
the
law
there...
of
the
law
of
alabama
there
were
that
a
proceeding
which
existed
under
the
common
law
or
under
statute
law
could
be
brought
in
the
courts
of
general
jurisdiction
of
alabama.
but
the
fela
could
not
be
brought
because
it
was
under
federal
law
and
the
express
language
of
the
alabama
statute
did
not
include
a
claim
based
on
federal
law.
in
reversing
the
case,
justice
brandeis
said
that
the
question
of
jurisdiction,
although
originally
a
matter
of
state
concern,
is
ultimately
a
question
of
federal
concern.
and
if
the
only
reason
the
similar
claim
is
not
enforced
is
simply
because
it
is
a
claim
based
on
federal
law,
that
distinction
cannot
be
observed.
and
the
court
must
entertain
that
claim
along
with
the
other
claims.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
well,
that's
not
the
sense
in
which
it's
used
in
florida,
your
honor.
there
are
a
great
many
cases,
in
amicus
brief
in
particular,
in
which
it's
pointed
out
that
any
exercise
of...
of
discretion
such
as
an
executive
decision,
where
to
put
a
traffic
light,
a
policeman's
failure
to
make
an
arrest
which
ultimately
resulted
in
a
crime
by
the
person
not
arrested...
all
of
those
things
involving
discretion
and
the
exercise
of
official
duties
generally
are
said
to
be
discretionary
and
consequently
not
waived.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
there
is
a--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--there
is
a
distinction,
your
honor,
between
making
a
mistake
and
violating
the
constitution.
that's
our
position.
for
example,
a
decision
that
he
had
authority
to
change
the
hours
of
the
school
or
that
he
had
authority
to
change...
to
put
the
car
in
a
different
parking
lot,
are
all
discretionary
matters.
but
he
did
not
have
discretion
to
violate
the
constitution
by
breaking
into
the
automobile
when
it
was
lawfully
parked
and
locked
and
there
was
not
danger
that
he
was
going
to
run
away
or
anything
like
that.
it
was...
the
violation
is
of
the
reasonable--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
no.
the
facts
were
that
the
car
was
lawfully
parked
in
lot
where
it
had
been
lawfully
parked
in
lot
before.
apparently,
there
was
a
desire
to
drive
a
construction
truck
through
that
area
and
the
assistant
principal
was
contacted
and
it
was
decided
that
it
was
necessary
to
move
the
car.
our
position
is
that
that
did
not
give
him
authority
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment
by
making
an
unreasonable
breaking
in
of
the
car.
he
had
alternatives,
and
i
think
that's
what
your
honor
is
suggesting.
if
you
say,
for
example,
did
he
have
time
to
get
a
warrant--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--because
he--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--i
don't
think
i've
changed
that,
your
honor.
the...
if
there...
if--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--if,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
there
was
some
reasonable
action
that
could
be
taken,
that
was
the
action
which
the
statute...
or
which
the
fourth
amendment
required.
that
is
a
factual
matter.
it's
our
position
that
there
were
ample
actions
that
he
could
have
taken
without
breaking
into
the
car.
therefore,
the
breaking
in
was
unreasonable,
and
therefore,
it
was
a
violation.
we
don't
deny
he
had
a
choice,
but
the
choice
he
made
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
we
did
not.
under
florida
law,
a...
a
granting
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
is
error
if
it...
if
it
can
be
reversed
on
any
ground.
and
we
did
not
pursue
those
separate
matters.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
we
do
know
and
they
will.
yes.
there
is
an
abundant
law
that
the...
that
the
sovereign
immunity
claim
here
extends--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
it's
our
opinion
that
such
a
distinction
could
have
been
made
with
the
court
in
this
case.
but
it
was
not
and
we
did
not
pursue
that
aspect
of
it.
we
pursued
what
we
thought
was
the
central
concern.
that
is
to
say,
the
claim
of
sovereign
immunity
against
the
school
board.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
no.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
no,
and
i--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--and
if
i...
if
i
gave
that
impression,
that
is
not
our
position.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
our
position
is
that
where
there
is
a
distinction,
as
there
is
in
this
case,
between
liability
under
1983
and
immunity
under
the
state
law,
1983
controls.
the
question
of
immunity
under
1983
is
a
federal
question
and
that
of
course
was
settled
in
martinez.
here,
the
court
on
the
ground
that
we
particularly
attack,
said
the
school
board
was
not
liable
because
under
florida
law
it
was
not
liable,
and
that
was
the
end
of
the
matter.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
we
wouldn't
say
it
on
this
basis,
your
honor.
we
would
have
to
make
it
on
a
different
basis,
simply
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
congress
to
make
it
enforceable
in
state
courts
regardless.
our
position
here
is,
as
i
said
earlier,
i
believe
is
an
intermediate
position.
once
the
state
is
under...
undertaken
to
grant
jurisdiction
or
entertain
a
claim
of
the
class
of
claims--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--in
this
case,
tort
claims,
of
which
the
federal
claim
is
itself
a
member,
then
it
may
not
refuse
to
entertain
that
claim
merely
because
it's
a
federal
claim.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
no,
it
would
not
if
you
mean
in
his
official
capacity.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
it
would
not.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
we
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
is...
the
reason
that
i
enunciated
a
little
earlier,
the
fact
that
there
is
no
discretion
to
violate
the
constitution
and
the
only
exception
to
the
waiver
is
the
discretionary
exception,
though
we
think
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
cannot
be
brought
within
the
discretionary--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--no.
it's
not,
your
honor.
the
reason
the
suit
could
not
be
brought
against
the
school
board
or
against
the
superintendent
in
his
official
capacity
is
because
they
are
immune
from
suit
in
their
official
capacities.
if
they
were
not
immune,
then
the
question
would
arise
as
to
whether
the
act
was
discretionary.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
we
say
that
it
couldn't
be
discretionary--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
that
is
correct.
we
also
take
the
position
that
under
federal
law
sovereign
immunity
is
just
one
more
example
of
an
immunity
claim
which
can
be
brought
or
asserted
under
1983.
and
we,
of
course,
take
the
further
position
that
it
cannot
be
maintained.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
the
tort
we
were
seeking
to
redress
was
intentional.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
if
it
were,
it
would
clearly
fall.
we
would--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--that's
really
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
is
the
reason
i
stated,
that
there
is
no...
there
is
no
authority
to
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
we
don't
think
it's
neutral
if
the
only
effect
of
it
is
to
preclude
the
assertion
of
a
federal
claim
which
is--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--that's
true.
that's
true.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
simply
because
under...
under
this
court's
decision
as
in
owen,
it
is
not
permissible
to
violate
the
constitution.
and
both
of
these
examples
are
intentional.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
we
could.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
it's...
we
felt
it
was
desirable
to
explore
this
area
and
to
make
1983
available
in
state
court.
it
was
a
deliberate
decision
to
raise
this
question.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
that's
true,
and
that
was
discussed
with
the
client,
and
we
explained
to
him
what
we
thought
we
could
do
with
this
case.
and
he
was
in
accord
with
that.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
well,
as
your
honor
knows
the
eleventh
amendment
has
two--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--has
two...
two
steps
removed--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
we
argue
it
that
way.
the
eleventh
amendment
is
two
steps
removed.
the
first
is
that
we're
in
state
court.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
and
the
second
is
as
result
of
this
court's
recent
decision
in
will,
the
state
in
its
agencies
are
immune
in
any
event.
and
this
court
said
that
in
doyle
against
the
mt.
healthy
city
school
board,
in
which
it
also
said
that
a
school
board
was
more
like
a
county
and
a
municipality,
and
for
that
reason,
the
liability
carries
over.
we
simply
seek
to
enforce
that
liability
in
state
court
rather
than
in
federal
court.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
gardner
w.

mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
1983.
this
court
has
over
a--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--over
a
period
of
time
this
court
has
recognized
many
immunities
under
1983:
executive
immunity
in
tenney
against
brandhove,
judicial
immunity
in
ray
against
pierson.
that's
the
only
two
that
occur
to
me
immediately,
but
there
are
any
number...
in
fact
i
have
a--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--a
list
of
them
here.
scheuer
against
rhodes
was
executive
immunity.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
well,
we
start
with
the
proposition
that
1983
on
its
face
shows
no
immunities.
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
are
a
number
of
common
law
immunities
which
are
built...
which
congress
presumably
built
into
1983.
one
of
them
is
not
the
immunity
of
school
boards.
so
we
therefore
say
that
1983
controls
this
case
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
extending
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
now,
i'm
not
sure
i--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
we
say
1983
forbids
it.
it's
up
to
the
state
of
florida
initially
as
to
what
of
its
agencies
or
creatures
it
will
grant
immunity.
and
the
state
of
florida
has
done
so.
our
position
is
that
under
1983
only
those
immunities
which
this
court
has
recognized
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
apply
in
state
court.
and
one
of
those
is
not
the
immunity
of
school
boards.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
therefore,
the
school
boards
are
not
immune
under
federal
law
even
though
they
are
immune
under
state
law.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
fourth
case
that
i
would
have
cited
in
this
court's
line
of
what
we
call
intermediate
cases
where
there
is
an
entertaining
in
the
state
court
of
a
similar
cause
of
action
is
testa.
and
testa
was
a
decision
written
in
1947
by
justice
black
and
it,
i
think,
contains
important
language
on
the
question
on
which
we're
thrashing
around
here
about
jurisdiction.
in
testa,
justice
black
said
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
how
you
characterize
the
defense.
whether
you
put
it
on
jurisdictional
grounds
or
was
done
in
testa,
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
government
was
a
foreign
sovereign
and,
therefore,
the
state
of
rhode
island
would
not
enforce
a
foreign
penal
statute.
the...
justice
black
answered
that
by
saying
from
the
federal
viewpoint
how
you
characterize
it
is
immaterial.
the
question
is
do
you
have
a
federal
cause
of
action
which,
had
it
not
been
federal
rather
than
state,
would
have
been
enforced.
and
the
answer
was
yes.
rhode
island
had
a
similar
statute.
the
other
argument
in
that
connection
is
a
slight
misapplication
of
the
idea
of
the
neutral
rule,
that
if
a...
this
claim
should
be
barred
because
the
court
does
not
otherwise
entertain
this
type
of
claim.
the
question
is
whether
it
entertains
the
class
of
claims,
which
it
does.
it
entertains
tort
claims.
therefore,
under
the
authorities
i
cited,
the
fact
that
it
wants
to
eliminate
the
federal
claim
means
it's
doing
it
only
on
a
federal--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--it
wouldn't
work
because
once
florida
creates
a
class
as
the...
justice
brandeis
said,
the
alabama
courts,
the
courts
of
general
jurisdiction,
they
can
entertain
these
claims,
it
must
entertain
this
claim
and
not
discriminate
merely
because
it's
federal.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
that's
precisely
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
where--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--it's...
if
we--
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
--you
cannot
define
it
simply
as
the
class
which
is
excluded.
it
has
to
be
defined
as
membership
in
a
class
which
is
recognized
and
enforced.
mr.
gardner
w.
beckett,
jr.
that's
correct
and
we
think
that
there
is
guidance
from
this
court
on
that
point.
the
other
argument
that
we
have
in
our
brief
which
this
court
i
think
would
be
interested
in
is
the
so-called
half-loaf
argument.
it's
quite
clear
from
such
cases
as
maine
against
thiboutot
and
felder
that
once
the
state
courts
entertain
a
1983
action,
they
may
not
give
a
half
loaf.
and
in
effect,
that's
what
they
are
doing
in
this
case.
they
say
we
will
entertain
it,
but
we
won't
entertain
it
against
the
school
board.
the
question
is
when
you
entertain
it,
must
you
bring
with
the
federal
cause
of
action
all
of
the
baggage
that
it
has.
and
that
answer
to
that
is
yes
and
in
this
case
the
liability
of
the
school
board
is
established
by
this
court's
decision
in
doyle
against
the
mt.
healthy
school
board.
