justice
stevens
may
i
ask
about
the
jurisdictional
character?
is
it
a
jurisdictional
defect
that
the
school
board
itself
could
waive?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
the
school
board...
the
school
board
answered
and
the
judgment
was
entered
against
it
and
then
three
years
later
they
could
come
in
and
vacate
the
judgment
on
the
ground
that
they
really
didn't
have
authority
to
waive
jurisdiction?
justice
stevens
it's
even
more
jurisdictional
than
the
eleventh
amendment
would
be
in
a
case
involve...
brought
in
the
federal
case?
i
mean,
it's
strict
rule
of
jurisdiction
in
here?
justice
stevens
which
case
do
think
most
strongly
supports
that
proposition
that...
by
the
florida
supreme
court?
justice
stevens
but
is
there
supreme
court
of
florida
authority
for
the
proposition
that--
justice
stevens
--but
has
the
supreme
court
of
florida
spoken
on
the
point
that
you're
relying
so
heavily
on?
justice
stevens
so
you're
relying
on
intermediate
court
opinions?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
strongest
supreme
court
of
florida
authority
that
you
have
for
the
basic
proposition
that
this
is
a
jurisdictional
matter
and
not
something
that
can
be
waived?
justice
stevens
no,
you
don't.
if
you
haven't
got
it
yet,
why--
justice
stevens
--i...
the
opinion
before
us
in
this
case
is
not
quite
as
clear
as
you
suggest
it
is,
i
don't
think.
justice
stevens
again,
what
is
the
strongest
supreme
court
of
florida
opinion
supporting
that
proposition?
justice
stevens
well,
the
one
you
said
it's
definitely
a
jurisdictional
defect.
justice
stevens
i
have
been
inquiring
about
supreme
court
opinions--
justice
stevens
--and
i
guess
there
really
aren't
any
right
on
point,
are
there?
justice
stevens
let
me
just
get
one
other
thing
clear
in
my
mind
that,
had
this
case
been
brought
in
the
federal
court,
your
defense
would
not
be
valid
in
federal
court.
you
agree
with
that,
don't
you?
justice
stevens
your
reason
for
saying
this
is
not
discrimination
against
the
federal
cause
of
action
is
because
you
say
comparable
claims
in
the
state
court
would
also
be
dismissed?
justice
stevens
and
you...
you
mean
it's
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that
even
if
they
didn't...
if
they
answered
and
they
went
to
trial
and
they
got
a
judgment
entered
against
them
and
then
five
years
later
they
could
come
in
and
set
aside
the
judgment,
it
that...
that
strict
sense?
justice
stevens
you
think
that's
clear
from
the
florida
cases.
justice
stevens
but
your...
your
position
is
that
it
wouldn't
matter.
it
would
still...
even
if
it
were
jurisdictional
in
a
lesser
sense
of
jurisdiction,
it
could
be
waived
as
eleventh
amendment
jurisdiction.
justice
stevens
i'm
still
not
quite
clear
on
why
the
jurisdictional
argument
makes
a
difference
from
justice
scalia's
example
of,
say,
a
$10,000
ceiling
on
recovery.
that
would
be
equally
nondiscriminatory.
now,
why
would
one
raise
a
different
federal
question
than
the
other?
justice
stevens
but,
i
mean,
in
his
example
was
the
state
statute
purportedly
says
no
state
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
enter
a
judgment
in
excess
of
$10,000.
justice
stevens
i
guess
the
thing
i
don't
understand
is
why
it's
a
closer
question
from
your
point
of
view.
justice
stevens
well,
would
this
be
a
different
case
if
in
addition
to
the
school
board
they
also
had
the
police
department
so
there
were
two
defendants,
so
they
entertained
the
action
but
the
question
whether
they
can
bring
it
against
a
particular
defendant.
why...
would
that
make
it
different?
there
would
be
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
claim
but
no
jurisdiction
to
enter
judgment
against
the
school
board.
justice
stevens
i
don't
see--
justice
stevens
--why
that's
different
from
lacking
jurisdiction
to
enter
an
$11,000
judgment.
i
just
don't
quite...
i
just
don't
follow
the
argument.
i
guess
maybe
i'm
thick.
justice
stevens
i
think
your
view
would
say
that
they
could...
they
could
also
immunize
parole
board
officials,
too,
from
parole
release
decisions.
justice
stevens
divest
them
of
jurisdiction
over
the
kind
of
claim
that
was
asserted
in
martinez.
justice
stevens
well,
that
case,
of
course,
it
did.
that
was
a
state
statute
applied
to
state...
state
cases
just
like
federal
cases.
i
think
you're
saying
martinez
is
wrong.
justice
stevens
altogether.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it
also
quoted
from
a
seventh
circuit
opinion
which
is
somewhat
inconsistent
with
your
argument.
[laughter]
