justice
scalia
mr.
beckett,
could
i
ask--
--the
other
end.
yeah.
could
i
ask
you
to
come
back
to
this...
this
discretionary
point.
florida
law
says,
and
you
agree,
that
a
tort
claim
will
not
lie
under
its
waiver
of
sovereignty
with
respect
to
discretionary
acts,
and
your
response
is
that
there
is
no
discretion
to
violate
the
constitution.
well,
is
that
what
florida
means
by...
by
discretion?
i
mean,
i
assume
that
there
is
no
discretion
to
commit
any
tort
in
that
sense.
justice
scalia
well,
why...
why
isn't
there
some
discretion
involved
here
on
the
part
of
the
principal
as
to
whether
he
had
authority
to
make
the
examination
of
the
car
that
he
did
and
as
to
whether
the
procedures
that
were
provided
in
the
hearings
were
adequate?
why
isn't
there
some
discretionary--
justice
scalia
--judgment
implied
in
that?
justice
scalia
didn't
he
have
some
discretion
to
decide
whether
there
was
danger
that
it
was
going...
going
to
be
taken
before...
before
he
could
get
a
warrant
and
before
proper
investigation
could
be
made?
justice
scalia
didn't
somebody
have
to
make
that
decision?
justice
scalia
well,
you're
making
a
quite
different
argument
though
now.
now
you're
making
the
argument
that
in
the
facts
of
this
case
there
was
no
discretion
involved.
but
the--
justice
scalia
--but
your
initial
argument
was
that
no
violation
of
section
1983
could
come
within
florida's
discretionary
exception
because
there
is
simply
never
any
discretion
to
violate
the
constitution.
that's
a
much
broader
argument.
justice
scalia
well,
you
haven't
changed
it
but
your
not
defending
it
either.
you're
defending
a
quite
different
proposition.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
the...
the
discretionary
exception
is
the
reason
that
an
ordinary
tort
suit
was
not
have
been
bringable
in
florida?
is
the...
is
the
discretionary
exception
the
reason
you
responded
to
the
chief
justice
the
way
you
did,
that
the
suit
could
not
be
brought?
justice
scalia
well--
justice
scalia
well,
suppose
instead
a
florida
statute
says
that
no
florida
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
render
judgment
against...
against
a
state
agency
or
officer
in
his
official
capacity
for
more
than
$10,000?
justice
scalia
that's
the
way
it
phrased...
it's
phrased.
would
there
then
be
a
$10,000
limit
on...
on
1983
recovery?
justice
scalia
why?
justice
scalia
mr.
rothfeld,
just
out
of
curiosity,
why
would
a
plaintiff
want
to
get
into
state
courts
rather
than
federal
courts,
outside
of
docket
problems,
you
know,
backlog
problems?
justice
scalia
that
just
all
depends
upon
how
you
want
to
define
the
class.
justice
scalia
don't
say
it's
precisely
correct.
it
means
that
your
point
doesn't
mean
anything.
justice
scalia
i
mean...
you...
you...
you
can
define
the
class
as
prison
officials
or
you
can
define
the
class
as
tort
claims.
