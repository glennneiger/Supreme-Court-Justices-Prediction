mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
fundamentally
about
the
power
of
the
states
to
establish
and
limit
the
jurisdiction
of
their
own
courts,
and
there
is
a
single
dispositive
question
here:
whether
a
state
court
must
entertain
a
section
1983
when
it
lacks
jurisdiction
to
do
so
under
state
law
and
when
it
also
lacks
jurisdiction
to
entertain
analogous
actions
that
are
based
on
state
law.
and
here
i
must
disagree
with
the
reading
of
florida
law
that
mr.
beckett
presented
to
you
when
he
said
that
there
was
discrimination
between
state
and
federal
claims.
it
is
clear
in
this
case
that
this
district
court
of
appeal
didn't
entertain
petitioner's
1983
action.
it
simply
concluded
that
because
the
school
board,
respondent,
has
a
common
law
immunity,
an
action
against
it
simply
will
not
lie
at
all
in
state
court.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
it
is
clearly
a
lack
of
jurisdiction
in
the
state
courts.
under
florida
law,
sovereign
immunity
is
grounded
in
the
state
constitution
and
under
that
law
of
florida,
as
in
most
states,
sovereign
immunity
entirely
divests
the
court
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
it
said
this
action
will
not
lie,
and
it
went
on
to
say--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
petitioner
was
asking
the
florida
courts
to
recognize
an
action
under
federal
law
that
are
not...
it
does
not
otherwise
recognized.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
yes,
they
do.
we
agree
that
state
courts
routinely
entertain
actions
against
local...
against
officials
where
sovereign
immunity
is
not
a
jurisdictional
bar.
i
think
that
clearly
in
our
view
what
the
court
was
doing
here
was
applying
the
subject
matter
jurisdictional
bar
that
is
created
by
sovereign
immunity
rules.
i
think
that
there
is
no
question.
i
don't
understand
petitioner
to
disagree.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
let
me
say
as
a
preliminary
matter,
i
think
petitioner
is
not
well
placed
to
make
his
argument
about
discrimination
here
because
he
did
not
make
it
to
the
state
courts,
which
could
have
authoritatively
settled
it.
before
the
state
courts,
he
argued
simply
that
the
florida
law
of
sovereign
immunity
was
irrelevant
in
this
case.
he,
therefore,
did
not
argue
discrimination.
he
did
not
even
argue,
for
that
matter,
that
the
waiver
was
broad
enough
to
permit
his
claim
to
proceed.
and
the
district
court
of
appeal
therefore
explicitly
said
it
was
not
addressing
the
scope
of
the
waiver.
because
petitioner
didn't
present
the
argument
to
the
state
court...
they
could
have
authoritatively
settled
it
and
solved
this
court
the
problem
of
investigating
a
complex
area
of
florida
law...
he
shouldn't
be
heard
to
complain
about
that
now.
beyond
that,
the
district
court
of
appeal
clearly
decided
this
case
on
the
understanding
that
analogous
claims,
claims
analogous
to
petitioner's
based
on
state
law,
would
be
barred.
the
court
said
explicitly
that
petitioner
was
asking
the
state
court
to...
the
state
to
open
its
courts
to
federal
claims
that
the
state
does
not
otherwise
recognize.
and
in
this
very
case,
petitioner
asserted
claims
based
on
the
florida
constitution,
along
with
his
1983
action.
both
sets
of
those
claims
were
dismissed
which
seemed
to
me
fairly
persuasive
evidence
that
the
florida
courts
do
not
discriminate
against
claims
based
on
whether
they
are
state
or
federal.
beyond
that,
if
the
court
were
to
look
beyond
the
decision
below
to
florida
law
more
broadly,
it
would
find,
i
think,
that
florida's
waiver
is
not
discriminatory.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
the
opinion
on
this
point
is...
is
clear
that...
and,
again,
quoting
that
petitioner
is
asking
florida
to
recognize
federal
actions
that
the
state
does
not
otherwise
recognize.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
clear
conclusion
on
the
part
of
the
district
court
of
appeal
that
there
is
no
discrimination.
i
think
that
conclusion
by
the
state
court
about
the
meaning
of
its
state
law
should
be
dispositive
here
in
this
court.
if
there
is
any
doubt
on
the
point...
i
mean,
the
briefs
cite
an
enormous
number
of
opinions
from
the
florida
courts
dismissing
actions
brought
against
the
state
or
its
political
subdivisions
involving
circumstances
quite
similar
to
this.
i
mean,
if
the
court
has
doubt
about
the
scope
of
florida
law,
i
think
the
solution
would
be
to
send
the
decision
back
to
the
florida
courts
to
determine
whether
discrimination
exists,
if
the
court
thinks
that
that's
a
dispositive
factor.
but,
again,
i
think
that
the
decision
below
rests...
gives
the
court
ample
ground
to
conclude
that
florida
courts
do
not
view
discrimination
to
exist.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i...
i
think
that
the
language
that
florida
courts
have
focused
on
is
a
portion
that
makes
the
state
liable
in
circumstances
in
which
a
priva
party
would
be
liable
and
the
florida
courts
have
interpreted
that,
as
we
read
their
decisions,
to
exclude
an
area
of
governmental
activity
from
liability.
now,
mr.
beckett
said
it's
discretionary
activity
and
not
governmental
activity.
but
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
you
can't
sue
a
city
for
law
enforcement,
public
safety--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--one
can
sue
a
city
for
certain
types
of
property
damage,
negligent
property
damage--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
the
line
draw
by
the
florida
courts
is
very
similar
to
the
traditional
distinction
between
governmental
and
proprietary
actions
and
an
action
taken
by
a
city
employee
which
is
said
to
make
the
city
liable,
which
is
of
a
sort
that
the
florida
courts
would
characterize
as
governmental,
as
i
think
the
action
in
this
case
is,
simply
will
not
give
rise
to
liability.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
against
an
individual
police
officer,
yes,
who
is
not
protected
by--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no.
i
would
think
not
because
that
is
related
to
governmental
activities.
it
is
an...
an
intentional
violation
of...
well,
i
should
say...
stick
with
the
line
that
the
florida
courts
have
drawn.
and
i
therefore
think
an
action
would
not
lie.
and
again
in
this
case,
petitioner
asserted
both
state
and
federal
claims
as
the
basis
for
his
complaint.
both
were...
were
dismissed,
which,
again,
seem
to
me
fairly
persuasive
evidence
that
this
type
of
claim
is
not
cognizable
when
based
on
state
law
in
the
state
courts.
again,
that
was
clearly
the
view
of
the
state
court
in
this
case.
and
i
think
that
you
should
be
held
to
be
dispositive
of
the
meaning
of
state
law.
this
sort
of
evenhanded,
nondiscriminatory
application
of
the
jurisdictional
rule
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
the
court
has
dealt
with
before,
and
i
think
it's
the
sort
of
thing
that
the
court
has
indicated
clearly
is
not
a
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
the
court
has
addressed
in
a
variety
of
settings
similar
to
this
the
obligations
that
the
supremacy
clause
imposes
on
state
courts
to
enforce
federal
statutes.
and
it
has
routinely
made
clear
that
jurisdictional
bars
in
the
state...
in
the
laws
of
the
states
to
consideration
of
federal
actions
are
valid
to
permit
state
courts
to
dismiss
those
actions.
the
court
has
said
repeatedly,
for
example,
most
recently
in
its
decision
this
term
in
tafflin
v.
levitt,
that
state
courts
may
entertain
federal
actions
when
they
have
jurisdiction
to
do
so
under
their
state
law
and
when
congress
hasn't
vested
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts.
the
court
has
indicated
several
times
in
the
cases
that
petitioner
cites
in
testa
and
mcknett
and
mondou
that
state
courts
must
entertain
federal
actions
if
they
have
jurisdiction
to
do
so
under
their
state
law,
and
if
they
entertain
analogous
state
law
claims.
and
at
the
same
time,
the
court
has
held
repeatedly
in
cases
like
douglas
and
mayfield
and
herb
v.
pitcairn
that
states
are
not
obligated
to
disregard
evenhanded
limitations
on
their
jurisdiction
simply
because
a
claim
that's
presented
to
them
is
federal.
the
douglas
case
presents
a
good
example
of
this
principle
in
operation.
it
was
a
suit
brought
in
state
court
under
a
federal
statute,
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
it
was
brought
by
a
foreign...
by
a
nonresident
plaintiff
against
a
foreign
corporation
defendant.
it
was
dismissed
by
the
state
court
applying
a
state
rule
that
gave
its
courts
discretion
to
refuse
jurisdiction
over
actions
by
foreign
plaintiffs
against
foreign
defendants.
this
court
upheld
that
rule
as
a
valid
excuse
for
the
denial
of
jurisdiction,
even
though
it
precluded
the
state
court
from
hearing
a
federal
action
that
had
been
created
by
congress.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
douglas
v.
new
hampshire
and
new
york
railway.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
is
cited
in
amicus
brief
for
the
national
association
of
counties.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
national--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--for
the
national
association
of
counties.
and
it
is
discussed
in
the
other
briefs
as
well.
together,
i
think
all
of
these
lines
of
cases,
which
are
discussed
by
petitioner
in
his
brief,
set
out
a
consistent
reading
of
the
supremacy
clause.
they
preclude
states
from
picking
and
choosing
federal
statutes
to
enforce
because
they
don't
like
some
of
them.
they
preclude
states
from
discriminating
against
federal
law
for
gerrymandering
their
rules
in
a
way
that
discriminates
against
federal
claims.
but
at
the
same
time,
they
permit
states
to
create
neutral
jurisdictional
rules
to
shape
their
courts
when
those
rules
are
applied
evenhandedly
to
state
and
to
federal
claims.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i...
the
court
has
discussed
these
cases
in
jurisdictional
terms,
and
that's
why
we
are
emphasizing
jurisdiction
here.
i
mean,
in
the
mayfield,
another
one
of
the
cases
that
follows
from
douglas,
and
the
court
said...
and,
again,
quoting
from
the
court's
opinion
that...
that
when
the
state
denies
resort
to
its
courts
for
reasons
of
local
policy
and
applies
that
policy
impartially,
that
is
valid.
the
court
didn't
explicitly
hedge
that
in
terms
of
jurisdiction
and
i'm
not
sure,
therefore,
it's
necessary
to
do
so.
but
the
reason
i
think
that
it's
useful
to
view
this
case
in
jurisdictional
terms
is
not
only
because
the
florida
courts
clearly
view
sovereign
immunity
as
jurisdictional,
but
because
as
a
matter
of
intent
of
congress
in
writing
a
statute
like
1983,
i
think
it
seems
to
us
quite
clear
that
congress
did
not
have
it
in
mind
to
override
neutral
jurisdictional
limitations
on
powers
of
state
courts
to
entertain
claims.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
more...
much
more
difficult
case
than
this
one,
justice
scalia.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that
the
analysis
that
the
court
has
used
in
cases
like
this...
and
let
me
set
out
a
range
of
cases
which
are
i
think
are...
are
instructive.
in
cases
like
felder
and
martinez,
which
petitioner
relies
upon,
where
federal
courts
entertained
actions
under
1983,
under
any
federal
statute,
issue
in
that
case
is
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute.
the
elements
of
the
cause
of
action,
the
defenses
to
the
statute,
are
federal
questions.
and
felder
is
a
good
example
of
that.
the
procedural
rule
there
was
essentially
an
exhaustion
of
remedies
requirement.
the
court
said
congress
addressed
that
in
1983
and
excluded
exhaustion
as
a
element
of
the
action.
therefore,
the
state's
requirement
in
that
action,
its
attempt
to
modify
the
1983
action,
is
preempted.
the
question
in
a
case
like
that
is
one
of
congressional
intent,
as
in
any
preemption
analysis.
i
think
that
this
case,
a
jurisdictional...
a
classic
jurisdictional
case
presents
a
very
different
sort
of
question.
a
cause
of
action
is
not
typically
understood
to
preempt
a
limitation
on
the
jurisdiction
of
courts
or
to
conflict
with
the
limitation
on
the
jurisdiction
of
courts.
and
i
think,
again,
cases
like
douglas
and
mayfield
and
herb
against
pitcairn
show
that
in
this
setting,
where
there
are
state
jurisdictional
limitations
and
a
federal
action,
the
action
typically
takes
the
state
courts
as
it
finds
them.
now,
the
case
that
you
hypothesize
is
sort
of
a
middle
case
between
those
two
sets
of
principles.
it's
a...
it's
a
case
where
the
state
entertains
the
1983
action.
and
it
entertains
analogous
state
law
actions.
and
i
think
the
question
of
whether
congress
would
have
wanted
to
preempt
the
limitation
that
you
describe,
even
though
it's...
it's
made
by
the
court...
by
the
state
in
jurisdictional
terms,
would
be
a
more
difficult
question
than
the
one
here.
now,
my...
my
answer
would
be
congress
should
not
be
deemed
to
have
wanted
to
override
jurisdictional
limitations
of
that
sort,
and
however
the
court
wants
to
cabin
the
jurisdiction
of
its
courts,
that
should
be
dispositive.
but
again,
that
is
a
closer
question
than
this
one.
there
is
no
question
that
this
sort
of
sovereign
immunity
limitation
has
always
been
regarded
as
jurisdictional,
prior
to
the
ratification
of
the
constitution.
so
there
is
not
question
here
of
the
courts--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--apparently
not.
there
is...
there
is
some--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--my...
my
understanding
of
the
most
recent
florida
law
is
that
the
waiver
is
not
possible.
there
is
long-standing
florida
authority
that
the
legislature
must
waive
sovereign
immunity
of--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that...
that
is
reflective
of
the
most
recent
law
in
florida.
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
there
was
a
recent
case
of
the
florida
district
court
of
appeal
and
i
am
afraid
i
can't
give
you
the
name.
i'll
be
happy
to--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--the
supreme
court
of
florida
has
recently
denied
to
answer
a
certified
question
on
that
point
by
a
state
court--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--not
to
my
knowledge.
although
i...
i
am
not...
i'm
not--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i'm
not
relying
on
the...
absence
of
the
an
ability
to
waive.
i
am
relying
on
the
fact
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--offhand,
your
honor,
i
can't
cite
you
a
case.
i'll
be
happy,
as
i
say,
to...
to
inform--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
no,
we
cite
a
number
of
cases
in
our...
in
the
briefs
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
it
is...
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
florida
courts
do
regard
sovereign
immunity
as
a
defect
in
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
the
eleventh
amendment
is
as
well
regarded
as
a
defect
and
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
question
is
that
can
be
raised
at
any
time?
or--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
that
one
case
that
is
cited
in
the
briefs
in
this
case
is
schmauss
v.
snoll,
which
is
an
actually
an
intermediate
court
opinion
of
florida--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i...
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
the
intermediate
court
opinions
establish
florida
law
for
purposes
of
this
court,
for
the
purposes
of
the
federal
court
determining
what
florida
law
means.
i
think
that
what
the
views
of
what
an
intermediate
florida
court
are--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--yes.
that's
right.
the
state
jurisdiction--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
this,
again,
is
cited
in
the
amicus
briefs
in
the
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it's
the
strongest
case
that...
that
is
cited
in
the
briefs
in
this
case.
i
think
there
are
a
great
many
cases.
another
case
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
in
this
case
is
one
called
kaisner
v.
kolb.
i
think
that
there
is
no
disputing
the
proposition.
i
am
sorry
that
i
can't
cite
a
case
from
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
but
i
am
sure
that
the
supreme
court
has
recognized
that.
in
the
hill
case,
which
is
a
case
from
the
supreme
court
of
florida,
which
the
district
court
of
appeal
relied
on
in
this
case,
i
think
there
are
strong
indications
that
it
is
jurisdictional.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
amicus
brief
for
the
national
association
of
counties,
as
well
as
other...
other
clients.
i
think,
again,
to
return
justice
stevens,
lest
there
be
any
doubt
on
this
point,
i
think
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
florida
courts
regard
the
absence
of
subject
of...
well,
regard
sovereign
immunity
as
establishing
a
jurisdictional
defect
which
goes
to
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts.
i
think
that
petitioner
does
not
take
issue
with
that
proposition.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
my
understanding
of
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that...
as
i
say,
the
latest
authority
in
florida
establishes
that
proposition.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that
is
absolutely...
is
absolutely
right.
i
mean,
our
position...
i
mean,
the
question
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
whether
the
state
has
to
entertain
the
claim
in
the
first
instance.
and
if
it
does
not
entertain
analogous
state
law
claims,
as
it
does
not,
we
think
it
shouldn't...
it
isn't...
under
no
federal
obligation,
constitutional
or
statutory,
to
entertain
the
claim
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i...
i
think
that
the
question
is
whether
congress
has
wanted
to
set
aside
a
limitation
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the...
of
the
court
simply
by
enacting
a
cause
of
action
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no.
i...
i...
that...
that's
correct
justice
stevens.
and
my
answer
to
justice
scalia
ultimately
was
that
although
it
was
a
closer
question
for
the
reasons
i
stated,
i
think
that
that
would
be
a
valid
bar
on
the
jurisdiction--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
a
closer
question
i
think
only
because
since
the
state
court
is
entertaining
the
action,
the
question
of
whether
congress
would
have
wanted
to
sweep
away
limitations
on
that
action--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
the
court
would
be
open
to
adjudicate
the
claim
as
it
is
against
the
individual,
but
not
against
a
party
as
to
whom
it
lacks
jurisdiction...
as
to
whom
a
judgment
cannot
run
because
of
it
lacks
jurisdiction
to
enter
a
judgment
against
that
party.
because
it--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--lacks
jurisdiction
to
entertain--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
let
me...
let
me
move
away
from
that
hypothetical
because
i
think
the
case
here
is
a
clear
one
because,
as
i
said,
there
is
no
doubt
that
sovereign
immunity
not
only
is
viewed
in
florida
as
being
jurisdictional
but
that
it
is...
historically,
traditionally
been
viewed
in
all
jurisdictions
as
going
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
so
that...
i
mean,
there
is
no
question
here,
again,
of
the
states
playing
semantic
games
with
its
statutes
to
frustrate
federal
actions.
this
is
a
long-standing...
long-standing
immunity
lack
of
authority
in
the
state
courts,
which
is
grounded
in
the
florida
constitution.
and
it
seems
highly
unlikely
that...
well,
i
should
say
answer...
make
two
points.
it
seems
(a)
highly
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
wanted
to
sweep
away
such
a
jurisdictional
limitation
simply
by
enacting
a
cause
of
action,
as
it
did
in
1983.
and,
secondly,
the
supremacy
clause
clearly
under
this
court's
precedence
of
its
own
force
does
not
impose
an
obligation
on
the
state
courts
to
entertain
actions
under
those
circumstances.
and
let
me
address
the
meaning
of
1983
in
particular
because
that's
something
that
petitioner
i
think
sort
of
runs
away
from
and...
and
for
a
very
good
reason.
it
is
quite
clear
that
when
congress
enacted
1983,
it
was
not
intending
to
impose
special
burdens
on
the
state
courts
or
force
litigation
into
the
state
courts.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
in
her
opinion
in
felder,
when
the
statute
was
originally
enacted
it
vested
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts.
and
while
that
exclusivity
has
been
stripped
away
during
the
course
of
routine
housekeeping
revisions
of
the
judicial
code
in
subsequent
years,
there
is
no
indication
in
the
language
of
1983,
or
any
other
federal
statute
or
in
any
of
the
legislative
history,
that
congress
intended
to
force
litigation
into
the
state
courts.
to
the
contrary,
i
think
it
is
established
beyond
any
dispute,
the
statute
was
enacted
precisely
because
congress
mistrusted
the
state
courts,
because
congress
wanted
to
create
a
federal
court
remedy
for
deprivations
of
constitutional
rights.
and
the
court
has
said
over
and
over,
it
has
become
almost
a
truism
that
congress
constituted
the
federal
courts
the
primary
vehicles
for
enforcing
section
1983.
it
seems
very
hard
to
believe
that
a
statute
written
with
that
goal
in
mind
was
designed
to
impose
a
special,
unusual
obligation
on
state
courts
to
disregard
the
neutral
limitations
on
their
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if...
if...
if
the
courts
where
closed
in
actions
against
prison
officials,
based
on
state
law
as
well
as
on
federal
law
so
that
clearly
analogous
claims
were
being
excluded
and
there
were
no...
there
was
no
sign
that
the
state
meant
to
discriminate
against
federal
claims,
i
would
think
that
would
be
a
valid
limitation
on
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
that's
right.
and
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
requirement
that
the
state
not
exclude
analogous
claims,
as
the
court
has
said
in
cases
like
testa
and
mondou,
the
cases
that
petitioner
relies
upon,
is
to--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
would
think
not,
your
honor,
if
the...
in
the
martinez
v.
california
case,
there
was
a
similar
limitation
on
state
claims--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
would
think
they
could
vest
their
courts
of
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
if
it
is
done
evenhandedly,
if
it
applies
to
state
law
claims
as
well,
i
would
think
that
it...
they
could.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no.
i
am
not,
your
honor,
and
let
me
be
clear
on
why
i
am
not
and
this
goes
to
my
response
to
justice
scalia.
perhaps
i
didn't
make
that
clear.
i
think
that
when...
when
the
state
court
entertains
an
action...
when
it
entertains
a
federal
action
as
it
did
in
martinez,
it
had
jurisdiction
to
do
so
and
there
was
no
question
about
that,
the
state
is
obligated
to
analyze
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute
in
federal
terms.
the
elements
of
the
statute
and
the
defenses
to
statute
are
federal
questions.
in
martinez
itself,
the
court,
while
holding
as
you
say,
that
the
state
immunity
rule
was
inapplicable
in
a
1983
action,
also
expressly
reserved
the
question
whether
states
could
exclude
1983
claims
altogether--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--and
suggested
in...
in
its
discussion
that
the
test
there
was
whether
analogous
claims
based
on
state
law
were
excluded,
citing
to
testa
v.
katt.
and
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--to
that
point,
i
can't
speak,
your
honor.
but
i
think
that
the
seventh
circuit
citation
went
directly
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
defense
in
an
action
entertained
in
state
court
would
be
a
federal
question
or
a
state
question.
and
again,
i
think
that
is
analyzed
in
standard
preemptions
terms
of
congressional
intent.
since
it
is
a
federal
question,
what
the
federal
statute
needs,
the
question
of
whether
any
defense
or
any
modification
of
the
cause
of
action
or
procedural
exhaustion
requirement
or
whatever
is
valid
must
be
a
federal
question,
and
it
turns
on
what
congress
meant
when
it
wrote
the
statute.
the
precedent
question
of
whether
or
not
the
case
can
get
into
state
court
in
the
first
place
is
a
different
question.
if
congress
had
wanted
in
1983,
not
only
to
create
a
cause
of
action,
open
to
the
same
extent
that
state
court
causes
of
action
are,
but
had
also
wanted
to
override
limitations
on
state
court
jurisdiction,
it
would
in
terms
have
said
so.
it
would
have
said
state
courts
must
entertain
these
actions,
notwithstanding
limitations
on
your
jurisdiction.
but
it
plainly...
plainly
didn't
do
any
such
thing,
in
fact,
as
i
said
when
i
wrote
the
statute,
it
vested
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court.
so
petitioner,
i
think,
is
forced
to
fall
back
on
some
much
more
general
proposition
that
jurisdictional
barriers
to
federal
claims
are
never
valid
when
they
are
served
in
the
state
court.
the
court
has
already
rejected
that
proposition.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
would
think
outside
of
those
problems,
it
is
not
clear
to
me,
your
honor,
since
as
i
have
been
stating
the
elements
of
the
claim
are
entirely
identical
whether
in
state
or
federal
court.
i
mean,
there
are
always
an
element
of
the
forum
shopping
when
there
are...
when
there's
concurrent
jurisdiction
and
two
courts
are
open.
but
beyond
that
i
can't...
mr.
beckett
will
have
to
give
you
a
response
to
that.
i
should
add,
finally,
that
the
fact
that
congress
did
not
vest
jurisdiction
in
the
state
courts
suggests
the
balance
of
interest
that
the
court
should
bear
in
mind
when
it
decides
this
case.
it
would
be
an
extraordinarily
intrusive
thing
for
congress
to
require
state
courts
to
entertain
claims
when
they
lack
jurisdiction
to
do
so.
it
has
been
a
fundamental
prerogative
of
the
sovereign
to
determine
what
courts
are...
what
claims
are
heard
in
the
sovereign's
own
courts
and
for
congress
to
set
that
aside
would
be
a
rather
surprising
thing.
and
i
think
the
court
would
look
for
a
clear
express
that
congress
had
that
in
mind
in
writing
the
statute
like
1983.
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance
of
interest,
there
is
not
much...
the
federal...
federal
interest
here
is
relatively
unsubstantial.
federal
courts
are
open
to
entertain
actions
like
this.
under
1983
in
particular,
the
federal
courts
were
made
the
primary
vehicles
for
entertaining
actions
like
this,
and
it
should
not
be
the
law,
i
think,
that
a
statute
like
1983
overrides
neutral
limitation
on
the
jurisdiction
of
state
courts.
and
that
is
not
the
law.
just
two
months
ago
in
its
tafflin
decision
the
court
said
that
state
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
federal
claims
whenever
by
their
own
constitution
they
have
power
to
do
so.
