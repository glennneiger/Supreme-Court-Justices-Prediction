justice

do
you...
do
you
know
whether
florida
courts
will
entertain
1983
actions
against
individual
officers
in
their
individual
capacity?
justice
white
so
in
this...
in
this
case
you
say
that
even
if...
even
if
under
florida
law
the
case
against
the
officials
in
their
official
capacity
should
have
been
dismissed,
in
other
cases
they
entertain
the
suits
in
the
individual
capacity.
justice
white
there's...
that
they
refuse
to
entertain
1983
actions
entirely--
justice
white
--or
you
can't
really
say
that--
justice
white
--they...
they
are--
justice
white
--no.
justice
white
well,
you
wouldn't...
you
wouldn't
say
that
if...
if
florida
had
never
waived
any
of
its
sovereign
immunity
for
ordinary
torts
or
any
other
set
of
torts,
you
wouldn't
say
that
florida
had
to
entertain
1983
suits
would
you?
justice
white
tort
claims...
tort
claims.
justice
white
--they're
immune,
but
you
mean
that...
you
mean
they
were
protected
by
sovereign
immunity.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
i
read
your...
i
read
your
brief
as
suggesting
a
state
may
not...
may
not
make
itself
or
its...
may
not
make
its
agencies
or
this
local...
the
counties
and
cities
immune...
give
them
sovereign
immunity
because
the
eleventh
amendment
doesn't
give
them
sovereign
immunity.
justice
white
well,
i
know
but--
justice
white
--you
do
argue
that
in
your
brief,
don't
you?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
what
law
do
you
think...
you
say
that...
one
of
your
arguments
is
that
the
scope
of
immunity
defense
under
1983
is
governed
by
federal
law.
justice
white
what
federal
law
determines
the--
justice
white
--immunity
in
this
case?
justice
white
well,
tell
me
how
it
solves
this
problem.
justice
white
well,
go
ahead,
go
ahead.
justice
white
well,
how
does
1983
help
you
in
this
case
in...
in
establishing
the
limits
of
immunity?
justice
white
on
that
basis...
on
that
basis
florida
just
hasn't
any
business
extending
sovereign
immunity
to
cities
or
its
school
boards.
that
seems
to
be
your
argument.
justice
white
yes,
or
giving
sovereign
immunity
to...
or
providing
that
cities
may
not
be
sued
for
constitutional
torts
in
their...
in
the
state
courts.
justice
white
you
say
1983
forbids
that.
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
tell
me
how
you
define
the
extent
of
the
sovereign
immunity
that
is
waived,
because
the
statute...
it's
the
statute
that
waives,
isn't
it?
justice
white
and
it
says
that
there's
a
waiver
in
all
actions
in
tort
for
money
damages
against
the
state
or
its
agents
or
subdivisions
for
injury
or
loss
of
property,
personal
injury
or
death
caused
by
the
negligent
or
the
wrongful
act
or
emission.
justice
white
you
mean...
you
mean...
you
just...
you
just
can't
sue
a
city
for
damage
to
your
property?
justice
white
i
didn't...
well...
for
damage
to
your
property?
justice
white
or
intentional
property
damage.
justice
white
can
they...
can
you...
under...
can
you
bring
a
suit
under
florida
law
against
a
police
officer
for
beating
up...
beating
up
a
prisoner?
justice
white
well,
how
about
suing
the
city
for
that?
how
about
suing
the
city
for
the
act...
for
that
conduct
of
the
police
officer?
justice
white
mr.
rothfeld,
suppose...
suppose
florida
said
our
courts
are
closed
to
any
kind
of
tort
suits
against
prison
officials
or
guards.
we
just
don't
want
suits
to
be
brought
in
our
courts,
and
we
close
our
courts
to
those
kinds
of
suits.
but
they
don't
close
the
courts
to
suits
against
policeman.
justice
white
even
though
they
entertain
similar
suits
against
all
other
officials.
justice
white
do
you
think
there
might
be
an
equal
protection
issue?
justice
white
xxx
example
of
florida
attempting
to
immunize
from
suit
only
prison
officials
just
wouldn't
work.
