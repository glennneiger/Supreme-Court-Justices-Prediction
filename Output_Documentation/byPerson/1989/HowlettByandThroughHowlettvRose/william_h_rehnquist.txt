chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
88...
pardon
me,
89-5383,
mark
howlett
v.
scott
rose.
mr.
beckett.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
beckett,
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
another
way
of
presenting...
of
phrasing
the
question
is
whether
a
state
court
has
to
entertain
an
action
brought
under
section
1983?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
your...
your
position
is
that
the
state
entertains
claims
just
like
this
against
the
state
of
florida,
but
it
doesn't
entertain
a
claim
against...
under
section
1983?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so
what
are
the
other
claims
just
like
this
that
are
so
similar
that
florida
entertains
that...
that
this
should
be
entertained
too?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
what
are
the
kinds
of
claims
that
florida
courts
routinely
handle
that
would
cover
this
sort
of
claim?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
a
waiver
as
to
torts
which
were
claimed
to
be
violations
of
the
state
constitution?
have
the
florida
courts
spoken
on
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
would
a...
would
a
florida
state
court
have
entertained
a
tort
suit
by
your
client
against
scott
rose
as
superintendent
of
schools
for
pinellas
county
simply
based
on
a
violation
of
state
tort
duty?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so
why...
isn't
fair
to
say
that
florida
is
treating
both
claims
based
on
the
federal
constitution
on
state
tort
law
the
same
here?
they're
not
allowing
them
against
this
particular
entity
in
its
official
capacity?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
beckett.
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
the
name
of
that
case,
mr.
rothfeld?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
it...
is
it
cited
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
amicus
brief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
only
one?
chief
justice
rehnquist
should...
should
it
really
be
based
on
the
question
of
whether
the
state
courts
have
jurisdiction
of...
of
these
other
actions?
i
mean,
what...
what
if
a
state
says,
you
know,
this...
our
courts
are
courts
of
general
jurisdiction.
they
have
jurisdiction
of
almost
any
action
that
could
be
brought.
but
there
is
a
defense
of
sovereign
immunity
available
to
various
state
agencies
and
governmental
agencies
if
you're
filing
a
claim
for...
under
a
state
law
for
a
tort.
and
we
think
the
same
sort
of
rule
should
be
applicable
if
you're
bringing
an
action
under
section
1983.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is...
is
the
case
you
refer
to
in
your
colloquy
with
justice
stevens,
schmauss
against
snoll,
is
that
cited
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that
you
regard
as
the
strongest
case
from
the
district
court
of
appeal
on
this
question
of
jurisdictional?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
mr.
beckett,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
about
membership
in
a
class
of
lawsuit
defendants?
you
know,
it
really
just
depends
of
what
level
of
generality
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
beckett.
the
case
is
submitted.
