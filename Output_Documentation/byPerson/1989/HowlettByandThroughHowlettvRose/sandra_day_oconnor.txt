justice
o'connor
mr.
beckett,
did
you
raise
in...
in
the
courts
below
the
question
whether
the
complaint
against
the
officials
in
their
individual
capacity
had
been
dismissed?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
beckett,
if
a
state
decided
to
waive
its
sovereign
immunity,
let's
say
only
for
intentional
torts
of
any
kind,
do
you
think
that
you
would
be
entitled
to
bring
an
action
in
state
court
based
on
section
1983
for
that
kind
of
a
tort?
justice
o'connor
yes,
let's
assume
that.
justice
o'connor
well,
you
don't
think
then
that
there
could
be
any
room
for
saying
that
a
neutral
state
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
to
a
limited
extent
can
be
upheld
even
though
it's
based
on
section
1983
in
state
court?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
that
certainly
isn't
a
discriminatory
kind
of
statute,
is
it...
that
kind
of
waiver?
there's...
the
kind
that
we're
discussing
doesn't
discriminate
against
federal
claims.
it's
neutrally
applicable
to
both
state
and
federal
claims.
justice
o'connor
well,
that
isn't
the
only
effect.
by
assumption,
it
would
preclude
a
state
court
action
based
on
an
intentional...
i
mean,
it
would
waive
it
for
intentional
torts
only.
justice
o'connor
and
why
isn't
that
neutral?
justice
o'connor
well,
of
course,
you
could
file
your
suit
in
federal
court,
could
you
not?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
well,
its
language,
mr.
rothfeld,
did
say
an
action
pursuant
to
section
1983
will
not
lie
in
state
courts.
now
what
is
the
nature
of
the
disability?
justice
o'connor
but
the
court
below
didn't
really
say
we
lack
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
it
said
we
don't
entertain
section
1983
suits.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
state
courts
in
florida
have
jurisdiction
over
any
section
1983
claims?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
is
the
extent
of
the
waiver
in
florida?
is
it
a
waiver
as
to
all
but
discretionary
torts?
justice
o'connor
well,
we're
not
very
well
equipped
to
do
that
here.
what
do
we
do
faced
with
an
opinion
couched
in
this
language?
