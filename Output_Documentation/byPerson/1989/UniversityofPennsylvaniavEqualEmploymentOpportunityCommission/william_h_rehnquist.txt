chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
on
no.
88-493,
the
university
of
pennsylvania
v.
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission.
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--conceded
the
university's
right
to
determine
who
may
teach.
right
according
to
what?
state
law
or--
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
really
language
from
our
cases
where
you're
talking
about
a
state
university,
where
you're
talking
about
the
state
infringing
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
is
really
no
holding
of
this
court
that
says
that
professors
are
any
freer
from
state
infringement
than
any
other
type
of
people
who
might
have
freedom
of
speech
infringed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
this
serious
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
of
course--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
what--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--excuse
me.
go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
case
is...
is
the
best
from
this
court
supporting
a
proposition
that
universities
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
determine
who
should
teach?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
best
one?
i
don't
need
all
four.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
wouldn't...
wouldn't
your
concerns
be
partially
satisfied
at
least,
mr.
lee,
by
the
adoption
of
some
sort
of
a
privilege
such
as
attorney/client
that
perhaps
qualified
the
general
rule
of
oklahoma
press
v.
walling?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
but
the
attorney/client
privilege
doesn't
depend
on
any
concept
that
the
attorney/client
relationship
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--might
like
to
know
what
it
means.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
general
starr.
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
you're
really
giving
up
something.
now,
maybe
it's
not
very
much.
but
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
believe
that
one
is
going
to
be
as
candid
when
you
know
that
the
person
that
you're
reviewing
is
going
to
see
the
thing
as
when
you're
not.
it's
been
well-said
that
all
comparisons
are
invidious,
and
that's
certainly
true
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
the
government
retreating
at
all
from
the
rule
of
oklahoma
press
against
walling,
which
certainly
doesn't
talk
about
any
sort
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
review
for
subpoenas
but
speaks
in
terms
of
if
it's
reasonably
thought
to
be
relevant,
that's
the
end
of
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
an
impermissible
purpose?
what?
being
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
or
something?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
it's
a
public
university.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
only
argument
you
have
in
the
district
court
is
that
it's
burdensome
and
most
district
judges
reject
that.
at
least,
they
did
when
i
practiced.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
justice
powell's
opinion
was
a
one-person
opinion
in
branzburg.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
distinguished
public--
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
mr.
lee,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
the
case
is
submitted.
