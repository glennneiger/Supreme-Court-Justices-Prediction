mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
very
narrow
because
of
the
facts
out
of
which
it
arises
and
the
way
the
third
circuit
decided
it.
professor
rosalie
tung,
contending
that
her
denial
of
tenure
by
the
university
of
pennsylvania's
wharton
school
of
business
was
based
on
gender
and
national
origin
discrimination,
filed
a
claim
with
the
eeoc
which
initiated
an
investigation
and
eventually
issued
a
subpoena.
among
the
items
sought
by
that
subpoena
are
confidential
peer
review
materials
in
ms.
tung's
file
and
also
the
files
of
five
male
candidates.
the
university
supplied
all
of
the
documents
sought
by
the
eeoc
except
for
the
peer
review
materials.
as
to
those,
it
concluded
that
its
ability
in
the
future
to
obtain
confidential,
candid
evaluations
indispensable
to
its
tenure
determination
would
be
impaired
if
expectations
of
confidentiality
were
breached.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
they
basically
fall
in
two
categories,
justice
white.
one
is
both
outside
and
inside
evaluations
of
the
candidate's
work
that
are
made
by
colleagues.
some
within
the
wharton
school
and
some
from
business
schools
in
other
parts
of
the
country.
and
the
others
are
the
deliberative
materials
similar
to
a
confidential
conference
held
in
any
context,
in
which
the
persons
responsible
for
making
the
tenure
determination
meet,
discuss,
as
the
minutes
of
those
kinds
of
meetings.
the
third
circuit
conceded
that
disclosure
would
infringe
the
university's
right
to
determine
who
may
teach.
and
both
the
third
circuit
and
the
government
here--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
its
interest
in
deciding
who
may
teach,
which
we
contend...
well,
and
really
the
government
concedes,
that
it
is
first
amendment
based.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
at
least...
for
what,
now?
over
30
years
the
court
has
acknowledged
that
academic
freedom
is
based
in
the
first
amendment.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
that's
probably
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
in...
well
keyishian
might
be
a
holding.
there
have
been
four
instances
in
which
the
court
has
dealt
with
the
issue,
and
in
each
instance
there
has
been...
the
court
has
said
that
the
first
amendment
does
include
academic
freedom
and
that
academic
freedom
includes
the
right
to
determine
who
may
teach.
now,
to
be
sure,
this
is
the
first
case
that
has
squarely
raised
that
question.
but
at
the
very
least...
at
the
very
least...
it
must
be
agreed,
as
i
think
it
is
on
all
sides,
that
there
are...
that
it
is
a
serious
constitutional
issue.
and
as
a
consequence,
as
the
cases
comes
before
this
court,
there
are
two
elements
to
the
issue.
the
fist
is
did
congress
really
intend
to
give
to
the
eeoc
a
completely
unlimited,
unqualified,
absolutist
right
to
all
peer
review
materials,
notwithstanding
any
absence
of
a
particularized
showing
on
the
part
of
government
that
it
really
needs
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
it
should
be
noted,
justice
o'connor,
that
there
is
no
dispute
that
these
issues...
that
these
matters
are
relevant.
and
so
that's
the
question.
is
relevance
the
only
showing
that
must
be
made?
but
i
want
to
nail
down
the
extreme
nature
of...
and
therefore...
of
the
third
circuit's
holding,
and,
therefore,
the
narrow
nature
of
the
issue
that
this
court
is
being
required
to
pass
on
today.
at
the
very
least,
there
is
a
serious
constitutional
question
here,
so
that
in
deciding
whether--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
is
this,
justice...
mr.
chief
justice.
in
order
to
carry
out
what
we
contend
and
actually
what
this
court
has
said
on
four
occasions
is
a
first
amendment-based
right
of
academic
freedom,
and
particularly
its
component
of
who
may
teach,
it
is
essential
that
the
university
have
available
to
it
those
materials
that
will
enable
it
to
carry
out...
to
carry
out
that
determination.
i
would
invite
your
attention
in
that
respect
to
the
briefs
that
have
been
filed
by
the
association...
american
association
of
university
professors
and
the
american
council
on
education.
in
the
event
that...
well,
in
the
event
that
the
university
does
not
have
available
to
it
these
confidential
peer
review
materials,
then
there
would
be
substituted
in
its
place
a
substitute
system
which
would
rely
on
informal
communications
and
in
which
merit
would
be
replaced
by
influence
and
connections.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
four
cases.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
best
one
i
would
say
is
probably
keyishian
because
it's
a
holding.
but
it
in
turn
builds
on
justice
frankfurter's
earlier
dictum
that
the
court
has
repeated
on
four
occasions
that
the
right
to
determine
who
may
teach
is
an
aspect
of
first
amendment
freedom
that
is
protected...
well,
that
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
and,
in
a
sense,
the
best
case,
though
it
does
not
specifically--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--excuse
me?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it...
it
would
be
those
who
are
responsible
for
determining
the
academic
affairs
of
the
university.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
faculty
senate?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
state
senate?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
would
be
a
harder
case,
but,
yes,
in
that
instance
it...
it--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
would
be
a
harder
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
would
be
a
harder
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--in
the
event--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--in
the
event
that
you
had
those
kinds
of
determinations
that
are
central
to
the
operation
of
the
academic
mission
of
the
university
being
operated,
as
it
never
has,
by
someone
in
government,
then
it
is
that
entity
that
would
enjoy
the
first
amendment
freedom,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is...
well,
what
you're
posing
for
me,
of
course,
is
a
hypothetical
that
so
far
as
i
know
exists
in
no
place.
but
the
proper
framework
for
analysis
under
standard
first
amendment
principles
established
by
this
court
is
that
when
government...
the
only
government
in
this
case
is
the
united
states
of
america,
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission,
who
seeks
access
to
these
confidential
peer
review
materials.
and
when
the
government
seeks
to
infringe
upon
a
constitutionally-protected
right,
then
government
must
show
that
that
is
supported
by
a
compelling
state
interest
narrowly
tailored
to
the
achievement
of
that
compelling
state
interest.
it
happens
that
throughout
our
universities
today
those
rights
are
exercised.
peer
review,
tenure
determinations
are
made
by
universities.
and
i
want
to
stress
that
there
are
two
bases
on
which
the
court
can
find
that
those
are
entitled
to
some
level
of
protection,
that
there
has
to
be
at
least
some
kind
of
a
showing...
some
kind
of
a
showing...
that
the
government
really
needs
these
materials.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
fully
concede--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--there
is
no
question
that
the
right
to
be
free
from
discrimination
is
very
important.
and
there
is
no
question
that
these
documents
are
highly
relevant
to
that
issue.
but
we're
not
the
ones
who
are
advocating
an
absolutist
point
of
view
that
that's
the
only
thing
that
you
take
into
account.
we
are
the
ones
who
are
advocating
that
the
government's
side
of
the
balance
scale,
if
you
will,
is
not
permanently
nailed
to
the
floor.
that
you
have
to
take
into
account
something
on
both
sides
of
the
balance
scale.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no.
what
congress
did
when
it
enacted
title
vii
was
to
determine
that
title
vii
would
be
applicable
to
universities.
and
the
government
makes
a
great
deal
out
of
that
proposition
that
title
vii
is
applicable
to
universities.
we
fully
concede
that.
but
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
the
issue
is
not
whether
congress
intended
to
make
title
vii
applicable
to
universities.
it
is,
rather,
whether
congress
intended
to
give
the
eeoc
access
to
peer
review
materials.
and
on
that
particular
issue,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
indicates
that
congress
even
thought
about
the
issue.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
justice
kennedy,
i'm
not
aware
of
any
practice
in
any
other
context,
employment
context,
that
is
analogous
to
the
one
that
has
developed
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
the
determination
of
who
may
teach.
in
the
industrial
context,
in
any
other
context,
those
decisions
are
made
not
by
peers,
not
by
colleagues,
but
by
supervisors.
and
what
we
have
here
is
something
very
analogous
to
recommendations
that
you
get
when
you
hire
law
clerks,
and
i
guess
that's
the
closest
analogy
that
i
can
think
of.
it
just
doesn't
work
that
way
in
other
contexts.
and
what
we
have
here--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--really,
not
all
of
them.
not
all
of
them.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and...
and
that
is
the
point,
justice
blackmun
and
justice
o'connor.
that's
what
you
would
get
if
those
letters
were
made
public.
and
that's
what
we
fear
here.
there
just
is
no
analogy
to
what
is
at
stake
here.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
justice
blackmun,
you
would
be
far
more
aware
of
how
that
one
works
than
i
am.
but
i
will
tell
you...
and
this
is
developed
in
our
brief...
that
in
the
medical
context,
state
laws
as
a
matter
of...
state
laws
generally
protect
those
kinds
of
medical
peer
review
evaluations.
and
that
may
be
another
one
that
comes
fairly
close
to
what
we're
talking
about
here.
in
any
event--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--uh-huh.
it
really
cuts
in
two
directions,
justice
kennedy.
what
you
say
is
correct.
there
is
some
resiliency
to
it.
and
that
is
why
in
the
event
that
what
were
adopted
is
what
we're
advocating,
not
an
absolutist
test
on
our
side
but
a
qualified
privilege
such
as
the
seventh
circuit
has
adopted,
or
a
balancing
test
such
as
the
second
circuit
has
adopted,
so
that
people
who
give
these
evaluations
will
know
that
there
will
not
be
routine
disclosure
but
that
in
the
event
a
court,
after
careful
consideration
determines
that
the
case
is
strong
enough
that
it
needs
to
be...
that
it
needs
to
be
disclosed,
then
i
think
people
will
continue
to
give
those
assurances
or
to
give
those
evaluations
in
that
kind
of
context.
but
i
will
tell
you...
and
this
is
not
just
my
own
point
of
view.
it
is
substantiated
by
the
association
of
american
university...
the
american
association
of
university
professors,
the
aaup,
the
american
council
on
education
and
two
very
prominent
educators...
and
all
these
are
referred
to
in
the
briefs...
david
reisman
and
paul
mishkin.
if
what
you
have
is
the
third
circuit's
view
becoming
the
national
law
on
this
subject,
then
there
is
going
to
develop
in
place
of
this
confidentiality-based
objective
system...
there
is
going
to
have
to
be
some
kind
of
a
replacement
system
for
evaluation.
as
professor
reisman
said,
it's
going
to
be
the
informal
telephone
call
that
will
replace
the
confidential
peer
review
evaluation,
and
merit
and
objectivity
will
be
replaced
by
informality
and
connections.
instead
of
equality
being
the
governing
standard,
it
will
be,
in
its
place,
favoritism
and
informal
relationships.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
as
you
well
know,
justice
scalia,
there
are
in
my
profession
a
few
cowards.
but
that
isn't
the
principal
reason
that
we're
concerned
here.
confidentiality
is
just
as
important
in
the
academic
setting,
and
the
need
to
keep
certain
kinds
of
communications
confidential
is
just
as
important
in
the
academic
setting
as
it
is
in
the
governmental
setting.
the
same
kind
of
thing
that
led
this
court
in
united
states
v.
nixon
to
announce
that
there
was
a
confidential
privilege
for
communications
among
government
servants.
and
it's
not
just
a
matter
of--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
and
if...
if...
yes,
that
is
true
that
that
has--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
but
what
it
does
not
apply
to,
justice
scalia,
is
certain
kinds
of
relationships
that
in
their
very
nature,
in
their
very
nature,
require
confidentiality
in
order
to
function.
this
court
requires
that
certain
relationships,
certain
communications
be
kept
confidential.
the
same
is
true
of
congress
and
the
same
is
true
of
the
executive
branch
and
the
freedom
of
information
act
does
not
apply
to
this.
and
i
want
to
make
the
point
that
it
is
more
than
just...
than
just
weakness.
if
a
is
asked
to
express
a
view
about
b,
and
particularly
to
compare
b
with
c
and
d,
and
that
information...
and
it
is
perfectly
candid,
perfectly
open...
and
then
that
is
disclosed,
that
affects
a's
relationship
for
the
rest
of
his
professional
career
not
only
with
b
but
also
with
c
and
with
d.
what
i
want
to
bring
you
back
to
is
the
proposition
why...
what
is
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
balance
scale?
the
government
says
that
if
anything
other
than
its
absolutist
point
of
view
is
brought
into
play,
then
it
will
impede
its
enforcement
efforts.
my
answer
to
that
is
that
the
government
need
not
speculate
about
what
the
effect
would
be
of
some
kind
of
a
balancing
test
because
for
the
best
part
of
this
decade
the
government
has
had
experience
in
two
circuits,
the
second
and
the
seventh,
which
are
the
home
of
hundreds
of
colleges
and
universities
with
this
kind
of
a
system.
it
need
not
speculate
as
to
what
the
effect
of
that
kind
of
a
system
would
be.
it
knows,
and
it
isn't
telling,
notwithstanding
several
invitations
that
we
have
given
them,
as
to
what
their
experience
has
been.
if
it
had
really
caused
problems,
then
the
government
would
not
have
opposed
certiorari
twice--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
yes,
it
would.
that's
all
we're...
and
that's
why
i
say
it's
very
narrow.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
you
need
not
reach
that
first
amendment
issue
in
order
to
adopt
that.
this
court
has
the
ultimate
authority
under
the
rules
of
evidence
to
say
what
the
rules
of
evidence
are.
and
if
you
prefer
not
to
base
it
on
the
first
amendment,
then
that,
of
course,
is
a...
is
a...
is
a
alternative
that
this
court
can
certainly
take.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
it
could
be
done,
justice
white,
by
construing
title
vii
and
no
one
takes
title
vii
literally
at
its
literal
language
because
if
title
vii
did
entitle
the
government
to
all
relevant
evidence,
then
that
would
include
privileged
material
and
even
the
government
concedes
that
that
is
not
the
case.
that's
one
round.
another
is
to
say
that
you
construe
these
statutes
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
serious
constitutional
questions,
and,
at
the
very
least,
the
court
would
have
some
explaining
to
do
as
to
what
it
really
meant
when
on
four
separate
occasions
it
did
say
that
academic
freedom
is
based
in
the...
in
the
first
amendment.
finally,
it
could
be
done
simply
as
a
matter
of
a
rule
of
evidence.
but
all
that
needs
to
be
done
to
reverse
the
third
circuit
is
to
say
that
on
any
one
of
those
bases
the
government's
side
of
the
balance
scale
is
not
permanently
nailed
to
the
floor,
that
something
counts
on
our
side.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
here's
what
i
believe
should
be
done,
justice
white.
and
as
i
understand
it,
this
is
the
way
it
works,
from
my
reading
of
the
notre
dame
case
and
the
gray
case.
here
i
think
is
the
way
it
works.
the
first
thing
they
do
is
to...
the
first
thing
that
they
would
do
is
to
look
at
the
complaint
on
its
face
and
the
complaint
on
its
face
says
such
things
as
that
wharton
is
not
interested
in
china-related
research
and
that
there
had
been
some
sexual
harassment.
those
kinds
of
claims
can
be
investigated
without
ever
getting
into
confidential
materials.
and
then
there
are
other
investigations
that
the
court...
that
the
eeoc
could
make
with
materials
that
are
non-peer
review,
that
are
available
to
it.
all
we're
really
asking
is...
at
some
point
in
time
the
government
is
going
to
have
to
examine
the
materials
that
it
already
has
that
we
have
given
them
and
materials...
non-peer
review
materials
that
we
have
already
given
them--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--under
the
seventh
circuit's
view
it's
a
particularized
showing
of
need.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
it
means...
i
think
it
means
that
they
have
to
say...
that
they
have
to
show
that
the
materials,
the
non-privileged
materials--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
at
least...
all
you
have
to
do
to
avoid...
to
reverse
the
third
circuit
is
any
kind
of
a
showing.
but
i
would--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yeah,
all
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
all
right.
[laughter]
mr.
rex
e.
lee
not
ever
university
in
this
country
does.
in
my
opinion,
justice
blackmun,
it
is
the
majority
and
certainly
among
the...
well,
it
is
the
majority.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
a
long-standing
practice
that
really
is
rooted
in
academic
freedom.
there
is
a
classic
statement
on
tenure
that
has
been
issued
by
the
aaup,
which
incidentally
is
the
organization
whose
principal
responsibility
is
the
care
of
all
interests
of
university
professors.
and
the
interests
of
university
professors
are
on
both
sides,
and
the
way
they
balance
that
is
by
saying
that
tenure
should
continue,
that
confidential
peer
review
materials
should
be
protected
unless
some
kind
of
a
threshold
showing
can
be
made
i
think
basically
of
need.
inadequacy
of
other
materials
that
are
non-privileged
for
the
government's
purpose.
and
only
on
those--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--only
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
no
question
about
that.
and
there
may
very
well
be...
there
will
be
instances
under
our
test
in
which
these
do
have
to
be
disclosed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
probably
so.
but
we
would
like
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--we
would
like
that
decision...
no.
but
we
would
like
that
decision
to
be
made
by
a
judge
with
us
having
an
opportunity
to
say,
but,
look,
we
can
supply
these
other
materials
for
you.
what
is
it
that
you
want?
we
can
supply
these
other
materials
for
you
that
may
be
sufficient.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
would.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
certainly
would.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
also
part
of
who
may
teach.
i'd
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
agree.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
it
is
they
for
whom
i
am
speaking.
thank
you.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
now
very
apparent
just
how
narrow
this
case
is.
we
have
been
given
assurances
as
to
the
eeoc's
procedure,
how
they
do
not
come
with
a
blunderbuss
and
how
they
first
carefully
examine.
that
is
not
at
all
our
experience.
but
the
important
point
is
that
the
eeoc's
procedures
and
whether
they
are
adequate
and
whether
they
really
do
give
protection
or
not
is
now
at
issue.
under
the
third
circuit's
holding,
that
is
not
at
issue;
it's
irrelevant.
this
case
must
be
reversed
so
that
the
third
circuit
can
consider
exactly
that
issue.
it
has
been
conceded
that
confidentiality
is
a
value,
but
it
is
asserted
that
it
is
trumped
here.
all
that
we
are
asking
is
that
the
inevitable
and
irrevocable
holder
of
the
trump
card
is
not
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission.
what
happened
in
the
gray
case,
to
which
the
solicitor
general
pointed
with
pride,
is
exactly
what
we're
asking
here.
not
that
our
final
day
on
these
important
issues
be
our
adversary,
but
that
it
be...
that
it
be
a
court.
look
at
what
happened
to
poor
little
franklin
&
marshall,
and
this
is
why
redaction...
redaction
may
be
the
answer
in
some
instances.
it
is
one
of
several
factors
that
ought
to
enter
into
the
balance
scale.
but
in
the
case
of
franklin
&
marshall,
also
in
the
third
circuit,
what
the
eeoc
asked
for...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
