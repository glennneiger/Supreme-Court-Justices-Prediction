justice
scalia
excuse
me.
who
has
this
right?
i
mean,
what
if...
what
if
a
state
runs
the
university
and
it
says
we
think
all
hirings
in
the
university
are
going
to
be
made
by
a
committee
of
the
senate,
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
i
guess
somebody
has
a
right
to
say
who
may
teach,
but
does
it
have
to
be
the
faculty?
is
that--
justice
scalia
--so
it
could
be
the
senate?
you
could
have
a
committee
of
the
senate--
justice
scalia
--no.
the
senate.
the
senate
of
the
state.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
i
suppose
you
could
have
the
governor
decide.
justice
scalia
why?
justice
scalia
that's
my
problem.
why?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
what
is
the
principle
that...
that
members
of
a
faculty
have
a
constitutional
right
to...
to...
well,
replicate
themselves--
justice
scalia
--like
amoeba
or
what?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
so
the
government
has
a
first
amendment
right.
that's
phenomenal.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that,
mr.
lee?
are
academics
so...
so
cowardly
that
they
won't
say
openly
what...
what
they're
willing
to
say
confidentially?
i
mean,
isn't
there
something
in
fact
unattractive
about
a
system
in
which
the
applicant
for
a
job
is
given
it
or
denied
it
on
the
basis
of
statements
that
he
never...
he
never
learns?
he
doesn't...
doesn't
know
why
the
trap
door
has
been
pulled,
he's
just
gone?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
but
while
you're
talking
about
an
analogy
to
the
executive
branch,
didn't
we
go
through
this
in
the
executive
branch
a
number
of
years
ago
when
all
executive
agencies
that
get
recommendations
with
regard
to
potential
hirees
send
notices
to
people
whose
advice
is
asked
about
the
qualifications
telling
them
that
this
may
be
made
public?
isn't
it
true
that
that
material
can
be
made...
can
be
received
by
the
individual
under
the
freedom
of
information
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
hasn't
destroyed
the
executive
branch.
justice
scalia
are
you
arguing
that
this
applies
only
to
tenure
review
decisions?
why...
why
don't
the
same
principles
apply
to
the
initial
hiring
of--
justice
scalia
--an
academic?
they
would?
justice
scalia
so
it's
not
just...
not
just--
justice
scalia
--it's
all...
all
decisions
on
hiring
or
tenure
made
by
academic--
justice
scalia
which
colleges
are
those?
is
there
any
indication
of
who
they
are?
justice
scalia
just
give
me
a
few
of
the
best
known.
i'm...
you
know--
justice
scalia
--you
hope.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
general
starr,
many
years
ago...
and
we've
held
it
for
many
years...
that
there
are
no
limitations
on
government
investigatory
requests
except
that
they
have
to
be
relevant
to
the...
to
a
subject.
maybe
those
decisions,
which
go
back
well
before
the
administrative
procedure
act,
maybe
we
ought
to
reconsider
them.
why
can't
an
investigatory
request
be
arbitrary
and
capricious--
justice
scalia
--the
way
some
other...
i
mean,
even
if
it
is
marginally
relevant,
why
can't
it
be
arbitrary
or
capricious
and
therefore
be--
justice
scalia
--subject
to
review
under
the
apa?
justice
scalia
well,
but
arbitrary
and
capricious
means
more
than
just
improper
motive.
it
means
your
modus
may
be
very
good
but
you've
gone
too
far,
it's
absolutely
unreasonable.
and
i
think
that's
essentially
what...
what
mr.
lee
is
arguing
here,
that
it's
unreasonable
in
this
context
to
ask
for
this
kind
of
information
when
you
have
no
reason
to
believe
there's
any
offense
on
the
basis
of
all
the
other
information.
justice
scalia
i
think
you've
changed
your
answer
to
me
then.
you
would
not
be
willing
to
have
the
administrative
procedure
act
standard
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
apply
to
investigatory
requests.
justice
scalia
well,
that
standard
goes
well
beyond
bad,
bad
motive.
justice
scalia
general
starr,
can
i
talk
about
the
slippery
slope
argument
that
the...
that
the
government
makes
that
if
you
do
it
for
academics,
you've
got
to
do
it
for
everybody,
there's
really
no
basis
for
drawing
the
line
here.
can
you
think
of
any
other
group
where...
the
point
made
by
the
petitioners
here
is
that
this
is
a
different
field,
that
it's
an
area
where
the
people
who
make
the
recommendations
are
part
of
a
unit
that's
a
very
close
association.
the
people
who
say
my
colleague
deserves
it
or
doesn't
deserve
it
have
to
live
with
that
colleague
in
a
very
close
academic
association
for
life
tenure.
scary
thought.
[laughter]
now,
isn't...
isn't
that...
isn't
that...
isn't
that
different
from
any
other
situation
you
can
think
of?
justice
scalia
the
inquiry
is,
but
not
the...
not
the
collection
of
information
to
pursue
the
inquiry.
as
a
policy
matter,
i'd
feel
a
lot
more
comfortable,
general
starr
if
you
could
say...
but
i
gather
from
your
argument
that
you
can't...
that
the
eeoc
does
not
automatically
request
all
of
these
things
whenever
there
is
a
complaint
filed
by
an
academic.
so
that
in
effect
an
academic
can
say
to
the...
to
the
faculty,
you
promote
me
or...
whether
i
deserve
it
or
not
and
whether
there
is
any
hint
or
discrimination
or
not,
you're
going
to
have
to
disclose
all
the
peer
review
reports
about
me.
justice
scalia
which
is
a
distinguished
public
institution.
