justice
john
paul
stevens
general
starr,
that
provision
you
read,
really
that
doesn't
say
anything
except
you've
got
to
try
and
get
it
informally.
if
you
ask
for
it
over
and
over
again
and
they
keep
saying
no,
then
you
go
ahead
and
get
through
the
subpoena.
that's
all
that
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you're
basing...
as
i
understand
you,
what
you're
saying
is
if
you
go
about
in
an
orderly
and
polite
way
requesting
peer
review
reports
and
they
keep
saying,
we're
not
going
to
give
them
to
you,
and
you
keep
saying
we
need
them
in
order
to
make
a
full
investigation,
you're
going
to
issue
the
subpoena
and
you
have
an
unencumbered
right
to
have
the
subpoena
complied
with.
justice
stevens
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
you
tried
with
other
relevant
information
to
prove
the
charge.
justice
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
not
an
unreasonable
construction
of
the
problem
to
say
that
the
information
that's
most
relevant
in
a
case
like
this
is
the
confidential
information
upon
which
the
decision
was
made,
so
you're
almost
always
going
to
want
it
and
ask
for
it.
i
mean,
i'm
not
saying
that's
wrong,
but
it
seems
to
be
a
perfectly
normal
enforcement
practice.
