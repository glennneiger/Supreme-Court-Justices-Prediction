some--
[laughter]
justice
blackmun
mr.
lee,
what
about
in
the
medical
field?
letters
of
recommendations
as
to
the
physician's
being
given
staff
privileges
at
a
hospital?
justice
harry

blackmun
mr.
lee,
educate
me
a
little
bit.
where
did
the
concept
of
tenure
come
from
and
how
widespread
is
its
use?
does
every
university
in
this
country
use
the
tenure
plan?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
now,
you
are
a
president
of
a
university,
i
take
it?
it's
employed
at--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--is
it
imposed...
by
what?
by
the
faculty?
justice
blackmun
and
certainly
the--
justice
blackmun
--and
certainly
the
denial
of
tenure
can...
can
ruin
a
career,
can
it
not?
justice
blackmun
[inaudible]
if
somebody
says,
well,
i've
looked
around
and
i
can't
find
any
other
material,
i
have
to
have
this
or
i'm
out
of
court,
is
that
enough?
justice
blackmun
you
might
even
say
that
about
the
exclusionary
rule,
can't
you?
justice
blackmun
general
starr,--
justice
blackmun
--some
reference
is
made,
though,
to
the
university
of
pennsylvania
being
a
public
institution.
it
is
not
such
in
the
way
of
the
state
supplying
funds
to
the
university.
am
i
not
correct
in
that?
justice
blackmun
it's
a
private
institution
in
that
respect?
justice
blackmun
as
distinguished
from
penn
state?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
second
case
is
no.
88-493,
the
university
of
pennsylvania
against
the
equal
employment
opportunity
commission.
this
case,
coming
to
us
from
the
third
circuit,
concerns
academic
tenure.
associate
professor
rosalie
tung
was
denied
tenure
by
the
university
of
pennsylvania,
and
she
filed
a
charge
with
the
eeoc
alleging
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
and
sex
and
national
origin
in
violation
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act.
in
the
course
of
its
investigation,
the
commission
issued
a
subpoena
seeking
from
the
university
the
professorâ€™s
tenure
review
file
and
the
tenure
files
of
five
male
faculty
members
identified
as
having
received
more
favorable
treatment
than
tung.
the
issue
is
whether
this
tenure
file
material
need
not
be
produced
in
response
to
the
subpoena.
the
eeoc
successfully
sought
enforcement
by
the
district
court.
the
third
circuit
affirmed
and
rejected
claims
that
policy
considerations
and
first
amendment
principles
of
academic
freedom
required
a
qualified
privilege
or
the
adaption
of
balancing
approach
that
would
require
the
commission
to
demonstrate
some
particularized
need
to
obtain
peer
review
materials.
this
obviously
is
rather
a
sensitive
situation
in
the
halls
of
academia,
but
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
below.
a
university
does
not
enjoy
a
special
privilege
beyond
a
showing
of
mere
relevance
before
peer
review
materials
pertinent
to
charges
of
discrimination
in
tenure
decisions
are
disclosed
to
the
eeoc.
and
this
decision,
too,
is
unanimous.
