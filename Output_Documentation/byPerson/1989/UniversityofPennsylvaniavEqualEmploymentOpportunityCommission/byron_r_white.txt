peer
review
materials
are--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
really
want
to
just
construe
title
vii.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'll...
well
what
would
be
enough
for
the
government
to...
for
the
eeoc
to
show
or
for
the
plaintiff
to
show--
justice
byron
r.
white
--how
would
they
ever
make
that
showing?
justice
white
what...
what
level
of...
what
threshold
does
the
plaintiff
have
to...
have
to
surpass
to
get
these
materials?
justice
white
what
does
that
mean?
justice
white
is
it
probable
cause...
the
probable
cause
standard?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
don't--
justice
white
that's
easy.
justice
white
you
say
they
furnish
information,
but
do
they
furnish
the
materials?
justice
white
i
know,
but--
justice
white
--let's
just
take
any--
justice
white
--actually
furnish
the
written
materials--
justice
white
--they
just
don't
summarize
it
or
just
say,
now
here
was
really
the
reason?
do
they
disclose
who
said
what?
justice
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
mention
before
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
--yes.
justice
white
could
i
ask,
why
do
they
need
the
names
of
the
people
who
have
furnished
these
opinions?
justice
white
xxx
address
that?
justice
white
no,
but
are
you
addressing
it
in
your
argument?
have
you
been
addressing
it?
are
you
making
the
argument
that
you
need
all
this
material?
justice
white
including
names?
justice
white
you
aren't
really
suggesting
that
it's
necessary
for
the
commission
to
cross
some
threshold--
justice
white
--other
than
relevance?
justice
white
now,
you
don't
want
us
to
say
as
long
as--
--while
the
commission
sits.
as
long
as--
[laughter]
as
long
as
the
commission
continues
to...
to
say
they
have
to
make...
to
show
some
special
need,
they
may
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
if...
that
if
the
commission
just
dropped
this
case
and
issued
a
right
to
sue
letter
and
there
was
a
suit
that
if
this
privilege
is
available,
discovery...
she
could
not
discover
these
materials.
justice
white
on
what
basis
did
the
court
of
appeals
remand
on
the
redaction
issue?
why
did
they
think
there
was
a
case
for
a
redaction
perhaps?
was
it
sort
of
a
first
amendment
concern
or--
justice
white
--it
was
sort
of
an
evidentiary
thing?
justice
white
well,
in
a
non-title
vii
case
the
professor
is
denied
tenure
and
he
sues
and
claims
that
he's
been
denied
tenure
because
his
membership
in
some
party.
and
he
wants
the
peer
review
materials.
so
i
think
the
issue...
it
does
involve
the
world
of
ideas,
i
suppose.
justice
white
well,
he
claims
he--
justice
white
--he
claims
he's
been
denied
tenure
because
of
his
membership
in
some
party.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
win
this
case,
i
would
think
the...
wouldn't
you
think
that
the
plaintiff...
this
scorched-earth
plaintiff
would
be
able
to
discover
the
peer
review
materials?
justice
white
i
know.
but
you
say
there's
no...
these
materials
just
aren't
protected
by
any
kind
of
a
privilege.
