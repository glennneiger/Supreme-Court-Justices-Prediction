mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
view,
four
broad
considerations
should
guide
this
court's
analysis
in
this
case.
the
first
is
that
privileges,
although
fostering
important
relationships,
also
stand
as
obstacles
to
the
ascertainment
of
truth.
justice
stewart
put
it
very
well
in
trammel
against
the
united
states.
there,
in
his
separate
opinion,
he
said
any
rule
that
impedes
the
discovery
of
truth
impedes
as
well
the
doing
of
justice.
and
thus
this
court
has
been--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
could
indeed,
and
this
court
has
recognized
any
number
of
exceptions
to
that
rule
by
virtue
of
the
concerns
about
impediments
to
the
ascertainment
of
truth.
but
the
court,
justice
blackmun,
has
been
reluctant
to
recognize
privileges
that
have
not
enjoyed
the
sanction
of
law.
second,
the
recognition
of
privileges
is
a
well-established
function
of
the
judiciary.
we
do
not
quarrel
with
that.
but
in
our
view,
the
court
should
not,
respectfully,
engage
in
that
exercise
in
this
context.
the
context
of
a
comprehensive
congressional
regime
embodied
in
title
vii
and
in
which
congress
made
a
policy
choice
with
respect
to
the
coverage
of
colleges
and
universities
in
the
face
of
expressions
of
concern
about
academic
freedom
much
in
the
nature
of
what
we
have
heard
this
morning.
that
is
especially
so.
the
factor
counseling
restraint
is
very
powerful,
whereas
here
there
is
no
effort
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
impose
any
sort
of
orthodoxy
of
ideas.
rather,
the
government
is
seeking
to
vindicate
a
powerful
national
interest
in
the
eradication
of
invidious
discrimination.
third,
the
need
for
confidentiality,
which
has
been
so
vigorously
advanced
before
you,
is
by
no
means
crystal
clear.
as
evidenced
by
the
practices
of
many
colleges
and
universities,
reflected
in
the
bednash
study
that
is
described
at
pages
31
and
32
of
our
brief.
any
number
of
colleges
and
universities
follow
a
very
different
vision,
a
vision
of
basic
human
dignity,
of
treating
all
individuals
in
the
intellectual
community
with
dignity,
including
describing
for
them
why
the
trap
door
has
opened.
fourth,
and
final--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--they
are
not
identified
in
our
brief,
but
they
run
a
fairly
substantial
gamut,
as
we
describe
at
pages
31
and
32,
approximately
20
percent
of
the
surveyed
colleges,
approximately
100
colleges
and
universities
responded
to
the
survey
do
provide
information
either
with
respect
to
inside
peer
reviewers
or
outside
peer
reviewers.
we
don't
quarrel
with--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
am
unable
to
give
you
specific
names
and
verses.
a
number
of
these
colleges,
indeed,
were
protected
in
terms
of
confidentiality,
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
study.
[laughter]
that,
however,
does
not
intrude
into
my
argument.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
hope
you
will
be
convinced
that
my
confidence
is
well-founded.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
a
substantial
percentage,
not
the
majority--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--a
substantial
percentage--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--furnish
the
materials--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
they
disclose
everything.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
they
disclose
everything.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
confidentiality
is
of
value.
we
don't
question
that.
that
value
is
trumped
here
by
congress'
visitation
to
this
subject,
its
determination
in
1972
to
eliminate
an
exemption
that
colleges
and
universities
had
previously
enjoyed
by
reasons,
among
other
things,
of
concerns
about
academic
freedom.
but
in
extending
title
vii's
coverage
in
1972,
congress
was
acting
not
just
on
the
basis
of
the
nation's
moral
commitment
to
eliminate
invidious
discrimination,
but
out
of
the
congress'
express
concern
with
discrimination
in
higher
education,
discrimination
that
was
especially
difficult
in
terms
of
the
barriers
being
placed
before
women
and
before
blacks
and
other
minorities.
and
that
is
why
congress
saw
fit,
over
the
objections
of
those
who
said
this
will
curtail
academic
freedom,
the
confidentiality
process
that
has
been
previously
enjoyed
and
has
characterized
the
tenure
review
process,
that
will
all
come
to
an
end.
and
the
congress
acted
in
the
face
of
those
very
concerns
and
extended
title
vii's
coverage.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
i
was
deflected.
thank
you,
justice
white.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
proposed
qualified
privilege
that
we
have
heard
here,
or
the
balancing
test...
we've
been
told
that
they
will
be
happy
with
either...
will,
i
think
in
all
likelihood
from
what
we
have
heard
this
morning,
produce
evermore
of
the
wasteful
unproductive
preliminary
kinds
of
litigation
that
besets
an
already
overcrowded
federal
system.
in
the
gray
case,
the
second
circuit
case,
is
a
prime
example
of
there...
that.
there
the
district
court
fashioned
a
balancing
test,
applied
the
balancing
test
after
engage...
after
the
parties
had
engaged
in
discovery,
concluded
that
the
private
civil
rights
plaintiff
there
did
not
in
fact
need
these
materials.
the
case
went
upstairs
at
foley
square.
the
case
was
fully
briefed,
fully
argued,
and
the
second
circuit
unanimously
disagreed.
it
said,
no,
we
strike
the
balance
differently.
and
yet
the
benefits
that
would
accrue
to
the
academy
from
this
sort
of
regime
that
mr.
lee
is
urging
upon
you
are
quite
marginal.
this
information,
when
we're
talking
about
a
commission
investigation,
will
not
atypically
need
to
be
turned
over
to
the
commission
anyway.
in
fact,
it's
clear
in
this
case
and
this
kind
of
case
that
the
commission
must
have
this
information
in
order
to
do
its
job,
and
the
amici
seem
to
realize
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
they
need
the
names...
pardon
me.
let
me
make
one
preliminary
point,
if
i
may.
that
is,
the
third
circuit
has
left
open
on
remand
the
subject
of
redaction.
so
this
court
need
not
in
fact
address
that
point.
the
commission,
however,
as
a--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i'm
happy
to
address
it
in
response
to
the
question.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
our
argument
is
indeed
that
we
need
unencumbered
access
to
it.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
including
names.
we
need
to
know
names,
among
other
things,
to
determine
whether
the
appropriate
procedures
were
followed,
whether
the
same
kinds
of
procedures
were
followed
with
respect
to
professor
tung
as
were
followed
in
other
instances.
it
is
very
easy...
we
are
advised
it
is
very
easy
to
skew
a
tenure
review
process
by
determining
who
will
be
the
reviewers.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--oh,
i
think
it
could.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
it
could.
i
think
that
the
commission's
subpoena
enforcement
power
is
in
fact
subject
to
fourth
amendment
review,
determining
whether
this
is
unduly
burdensome,
unduly
oppressive.
it's
certainly,
with
respect
to
arbitrariness
and
caprice,
is
in
fact
subject
to
any
kind
of
allegation
that
the
inquiry,
the
investigation
by
the
commission,
is
being
undertaken
from
improper
motive.
that's
well-established
in
the
law
and
we
don't
quarrel
with
it.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
but
that
is
not
so
at
all,
with
all
due
respect.
in
fact,
to
the
contrary.
let
us
walk
back
and
see
what
happened
in
this
case.
very
briefly,
professor
tung
files
her
charge.
her
charge
has
any
number
of
highly
specific
allegations.
the
commission
then
undertakes
an
investigation
which
consumed
a
year.
it
was
only
at
the
conclusion
of
that
year-long
investigation,
including
meeting
with
the
university,
receiving
documents
that
the
university
provided,
that
the
commission
decided
at
the
district
director
level
that
it
needed
this
information
in
order
to
determine
whether
in
fact
there
was
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
professor
tung
had
been
the
victim
of
discrimination.
that
determination
was
made
here.
that
is
consistent
with
the
eeoc's
compliance
manual.
we
are
being
told
that
we
are
engaged
in
wide
open
casual
inquiries
which
would
in
fact
sound
in
the
nature
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
conduct
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--we
have
not
cross-petitioned
with
respect
to
the
third
circuit's
determination,
not
that
there
should
be
redaction
but
that
redaction
is
open
for
litigation
at
the
district
court.
and
we
would
urge
this
court
not
to
in
fact
interfere
with
that
process.
that
we
will
in
fact
will
have
to
in
fact
determine,
based
upon
our
analysis
of
this
file,
whether
we
under
the
circumstances
in
the
third
circuit
will
litigate
in
favor
of
unencumbered
access.
but
we
think
the
presumptive
rule
must
be
what
congress
intended,
which
is
unencumbered
access.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
am
not
retreating
at
all.
what
i
sought
to
clarify
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
was
that,
as
i
understand
the
law,
a
government
subpoena
is
under
existing
law
subject
to
challenge
not
only
on
relevancy
grounds
but
on
fourth
amendment
grounds
and
on
grounds
that
it
is
motivated
by
an
impermissible
purpose.
that
is
the
extent
to
which
i
would
agree
that
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no.
an
improper
motive
on
the
part
of
the
government
agency
to
harass,
to
act
vexatiously,
arbitrarily
against
a
subject
on
subpoena.
singling
someone
out
arbitrarily
for
some
improper
motivation.
i
was
going
to
say
that
in--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i'm
not
sure
that
the
issue--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
haven't
taken
this
through
an
apa
analysis.
i'm
not
at
all
sure
that
the
issuance
of
a
subpoena
sounds
in
the
nature
of
agency
action.
it
may
very
well
be.
i
have
not,
frankly,
thought
that
through
as
to
whether
this
would
be
subject
to
apa
review.
they
haven't
sought
that.
that
isn't
what's
being
argued
before
you
at
all.
but
what
i
do
know
is
that
there
are
certain
limitations,
in
response
to
your
earlier
question,
going
beyond
relevancy
that
in
fact
settled
law
would
permit
a
district
court
to
inquire
into.
i
wanted
to
give
the
court
assurance
that
this
is
not
casual
routine
disclosure
that's
being
requested.
the
eeoc
compliance
manual
is
quite
clear
that
the
commission
has
the
authority
that
congress
gave
it...
section
710
of
title
vii...
to
issue
subpoenas
to
obtain
access
to
evidence.
but
here's
the
operative
language,
a
subpoena
should
be
issued
only
after
all
other
means
of
eliciting
information
have
failed.
this
is
not
private
litigation.
this
is
not
litigation
mounted
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
with
its
very
generous
discovery
provision...
provisions.
this
is
litigation
under
a
subpoena
that
has
been
issued
by
an
agency
that
congress
established
with
the
specific
mission
of
investigating
charges
of
invidious
discrimination.
now,
mr.
lee--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
is
a
restraint.
this
is
an...
justice
stevens,
i
don't
over-argue
the
point.
the
point
is
a
very
simple
one.
that
this
is
an
orderly
process
in
which
the
commission
is
called
upon
by
its
own
procedures
to
engage
in.
it
engaged
in
that
orderly
process
here.
this
is
not
the
wide
open--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--absolutely.
absolutely.
my
point
is
narrow--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that's
quite
right.
my
point
is
that
the
commission's
standards,
unlike
a
private
plaintiff,
are
that
it
must
have
determined
that
it
needs
this
information.
that's
not
what
the
statute
imposes
upon
it.
it
gives
it
a
right,
as
we
read
the
operative
statue...
709(a)
speaks
very
broadly
in
terms
of
what
we
see
as
a
right
of
unencumbered
access,
subject,
obviously,
to
existing
privileges.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
agree
that
it's
normal
enforcement
practice.
the
comfort
i
can
give
to
those
members,
if
any,
of
the
court
who
are
concerned
in
this
respect
is
that
if
the
nature
of
the
defense...
if
the
nature
of
the
defense
is
that
this
individual
was
denied
tenure
on
grounds
of
misconduct,
on
grounds
of
dereliction
of
duty,
it
may
very
well
be
that
in
certain
circumstances...
and
we
saw
that
in
chief
judge
franklin
waters'
opinion
in
the
arkansas
case...
that
there
may
be
circumstances
where
it
would
not
indeed
be
necessary
and
perhaps
not
even
relevant.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
not
at
all.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct.
the
assurance
i'm
giving
the
court
is
this.
we
are
suggesting
to
the
court--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--indeed
not.
our
view
of
what
congress
has
provided
in
title
vii
is
a
right
of
access
to
any
evidence
that
is
relevant.
it
is
clearly
relevant
here.
it
is
powerfully
relevant
here
in
light
of
the
steps
that
the
commission
has
taken.
what
you're
being
urged
to
do
is
a
policy
matter...
we
are
involved
in
two
things.
we
are
talking
about
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
are
also
being
told
that
there
are
profound
first
amendment
interests
at
stake.
what
i
am
urging
upon
the
court
is
that
in
this
context
of
a
commission
inquiry,
as
opposed
to
those
concerns
that
might
be
generated
in
private
litigation,
there
are
constraints
in
which
the
commission
operates
and
that,
combined
with
the
powerful
right
of
access
given
to
the
commission
by
congress,
counsels
very
powerfully
it
seems
to
us
in
favor
of
affirmance
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
certainly
can't
think
of
an
exact
parallel.
i
have
to
concede
that,
that
this
is
not
exactly
like
the
newsroom.
the
argument
that's
being
advanced,
though,
is
because
of
what
is
not
our
particular
governance.
it
is
the
fact
that
we
should
be
shielded
by
the
mantle
of
the
first
amendment
from...
from
a
congressionally
authorized
and
indeed
mandated...
because
the
commission
is
obliged
to
investigate
charges
of
discrimination...
that
in
fact
a
decision
was
not
made
on
academic
grounds.
what
dr.
tung
is
telling
the
commission...
and
she
has
convinced
the
commission
that
it
must
go
forward
with
her
investigation...
is
that
she
was
denied
tenure
by
virtue
of
invidious
discrimination.
and
she
was
very
specific
in
her
charges,
identifying
a
specific
person
as
leading
the
effort
to
deny
her
tenure
in
the
face
of
a
favorable
vote
by
her
faculty
department...
by
her
department,
by
her
colleagues
in
the
department.
i
will
not
suggest
to
the
court,
however,
that
newsrooms
are
governed
in
precisely
in
the
same
way.
but
i
don't
think
that
should
give
the
court
pause.
what
the
court
has
been
urged
is
to
create
a
special
haven
by
virtue
of
the
historic
method
of
governance
of
universities
and
thereby
prevent
the
commission
from
discharging
its
duties
effectively.
and
that,
i
think,
the
court
should
not
do.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
quite
right.
if
the
privilege
were
available,
she
would
not
be
able
to
discover
these
materials.
we
would
urge,
justice
white,
the
court
to
consider
this
case
on
its
facts,
as
the
court
has
done
in
privilege
cases.
in
upjohn,
in
the
ewing
case,
in
the
horowitz
case,
the
court
has
been
very
cautious
in
proceeding
step
by
step.
i
don't
think
your
ruling
in
this
case...
the
court's
ruling...
need
go
any
farther
than
determining
the
commission's
right
of
access
as
opposed
to
the
right
of
access
of
private
litigants.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
was
broadly
stated
confidentiality
concerns
that
there
might
not
in
fact
be
a
need
for
this.
it
was--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--certainly
leaving
it
opened
for
evidence
to
be
adduced
as
to
whether
in
fact
the
commission
needed
this
information.
we
think
that
is
unfortunate,
but
we
are
prepared
to
litigate
that.
we
did
not
cross-petition.
there
are
several
points
i
want
to
make
with
respect
to
what
is
underlying
the
arguments
that
have
been
advanced
before
you.
and
that
is
academic
freedom.
this
inquiry
into
the
university's
decision-making
process
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
world
of
ideas.
this
is
not
sweezy
against
new
hampshire,
a
governmental
inquiry
into
what
was
being
said
in
the
lecture
room.
it
is
not
keyishian
v.
the
board
of
regents
where
the
court
was
concerned
with
a
governmental
effort
to
cast,
in
the
court's
words,
a
pall
of
orthodoxy
over
the
classroom.
there
is
no
effort
to
ferret
out
associations,
which
has
so
troubled
this
court
over
recent
decades.
shelton
against
tucker,
bates
against
little
rock;
the
great
cases,
naacp
v.
alabama;
in
the
political
setting,
buckley
against
valeo.
this
is
not
that.
as
the
fifth
circuit
stated
so
forcefully
in
the
in
re
dinnan
case,
there
is
no
attempt
by
the
government
in
discrimination
cases
to
suppress
ideas.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
certainly
could,
depending
on
the
grounds
of
the
university's
decision
and
on
what
the
charge
of...
what
the
allegation
is.
that
would
sound--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--on
the
nature
of
a
first
amendment
violation.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
right.
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
and
in
fact,
it
seems--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--at
a
public...
precisely.
that's
right.
i
assume
that
in
fact
this
was,
in
the
hypothetical,
a
state
university.
with
respect
to
the
university's
right
to
determine
who
will
teach,
which
is
one
of
the
academic
freedoms
that
justice
frankfurter
identified
in
his
concurring
opinion,
that
right,
too,
is
not
upon
analysis
genuinely
implicated
by
this
subpoena.
the
commission
is
certainly
not
telling
the
university
of
pennsylvania
and
the
wharton
school
who
they
may
promote.
the
governmental
inquiry
is
very
narrow,
it's
surgically
precise
and
it
relates
to
interests
of
compelling
importance
to
the
nation.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
a
case
can
be
washed
out
by
the
commission
at
any
point.
it
can
wash
out
a
complaint,
a
charge
that
is
filed,
at
the
moment
it
interviews
the
charging
party
and
concludes
that
she
is
incredible,
not
worthy
of
belief,
it
can
wash
out.
there
will
be
no
automatic
access.
in
fact,
the
commission's
records
show
that
with
respect
to
the
substantial
number
of
tenure
charges,
of
tenure-related
charges
of
discrimination
in
recent
years,
there
have
been
a
grand
total
of
three
subpoenas
issue
two
of
which
have
been
issued
to
the
university
of
pennsylvania.
the
commission
does
not
in
fact
engage
in
a
scorched-earth
litigation
policy.
it
is
charged
by
congress
to
carry
out
its
mission
in
order--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
certainly
would
cover
that.
i
would
urge
the
court,
for
reasons
already
stated,
not
to
deal
with
the
scorched-earth
case
here.
this
is
not
that
case.
the
commission
has
not
been
accused,
at
least
fairly,
of
engaging
in
a
scorched-earth
litigation
policy.
it
does
not
do
so,
and,
in
fact,
to
do
so
would
be
in
violation
of
its
own
compliance
manual.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
once
the
private
plaintiff,
justice
white,
is
proceeding
under
the
federal
rules,
then
there
is
an
enormous
amount
of
latitude
that
is
given
to
federal
district
judges
in
governing
the
conduct
of
the
litigation,
just--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
don't
think
the
court
should
address
that
issue
here.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
all
respect,
this
court
has
said
time
and
again,
including
a
very
instructive
opinion
by
justice
powell
in
branzburg
against
hays,
noting
that
district
courts
do
not
have
to
blind
themselves
to
the
sensitivity,
the
potential
sensitivity
of
litigation,
and
can
govern
the
litigation
appropriately.
that
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--quite
right.
but
i
read
it
with
great
respect.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
[laughter]
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
quite
right.
it
is
a
private
institution.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it's
a
very
distinguished
private
institution.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
quite
right.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i...
readily
i
accept.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
final
thing
that
i
want
to
leave
with
the
court
is
that
the
extent
of
this
intrusion
is
narrow.
this
is
not
a
blunderbuss
subpoena.
i
thank
the
court.
