--well,
mr.
lee,
that
certainly
is
a
weak
sort
of
a
first
amendment
interest
and
wouldn't
the
same
interest
extend
to
employees
of
a
newspaper
or
a
public
advocacy
organization
or
to
a
wide
range
of
employees?
it
strikes
me
as
a
rather
minimal
first
amendment
interest,
if
it
is
such.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
they're
relevant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
showing
of
relevance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
need.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
go
ahead,
chief
justice.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
lee,
the...
the
interest
on
the
other
side
in
this
case
of
a...
a
faculty
member
to
be
considered
for
tenure
without
the
impermissible
consideration
of
race
or
gender
seems
to
be
a
much
more
direct
constitutional
right
that
we're
talking
about.
what
about
the...
the
employee's
constitutional
rights
here?
justice
o'connor
and
certainly
these...
these
evaluations
on
which
the
tenure
decision
is
based
are
of
critical
importance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
can't
imagine
anything
that
would
be
more
relevant
than
an
examination
of
those
tenure
evaluation
letters.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
didn't
congress
do
that
when
it
enacted
title
vii?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
we
get
are
all
letters
saying
they're
wonderful.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
starr...
general
starr,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
third
circuit
certainly
thought
at
least
that
furnishing
the
names
might
not
be
as
relevant
and
not
as
necessary
and
that
that
could
be
redacted.
now,
it
seems
to
me
there
ought
to
be
perhaps
some
residual
power
in
the
court
to
determine
the
degree
of
relevance
and
perhaps
to
redact
names
if
it
thought
that
wasn't
essential.
