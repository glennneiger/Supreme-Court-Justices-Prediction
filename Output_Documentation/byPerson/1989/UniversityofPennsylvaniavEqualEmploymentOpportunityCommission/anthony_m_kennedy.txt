justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
mr.
lee,
despite
your
welcome
assurances
that
this
is
a
narrow
issue,
i
just
can't
see
it
that
way.
as
justice
o'connor's
first
question
indicated,
what
about
the
right
of
the
press
to
hire
the
reporter
that
it
wants
or
the
editor
that
it
wants,
or
the
movie
producer
to
hire
the
screen
writer
that
it
wants?
all
of
those
are
very,
very
close
to
protected
first
amendment
expression,
core
first
amendment
expression.
and
the
congress
hasn't
made
any
special
rules
for
them
either.
so,
the
principle
you're
asking
us
to
establish,
i
respectfully
suggest,
is
one
of
vast
scope.
it's
not
a
narrow
issue
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
lee,
that
the
very
fact
that
the
tenure
system
is
recognized
and
established
gives
it
a
certain
institutional
strength
that
can
resist
any
pressures
that
a
contrary
holding
might
have...
holding
contrary
to
your
position.
whereas,
if
we
spread
it
to
the
newspaper
world
and
so
forth,
there
might
be
a
tendency
for
newspaper
people
to
be
very
cautious
about
recommendations.
but
the
very
fact
that
it's
established
seems
to
me
to
cut
somewhat
against
you.
there
is
a
resiliency
here,
an
ability
to
adopt.
justice
kennedy
--mr.
lee,
just
one
more
point.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
not
a
question
where
we
have
the
first
amendment
on
one
side
and
employment
policies
on
the
other
because
a
person
from
a
racial
minority
or
a
woman
on
a
faculty
where
men
are
not
represented
has
her
own
very
strong
first
amendment
right
in
participating
in
this
principle...
in
this
privilege
of
academic
freedom
that
you're
defending.
justice
kennedy
so
it
seems
to
me
that
they
also
have
a
first
amendment
right.
justice
kennedy
but,
counsel,
some...
some
plaintiffs
do...
there
have
been
any
number
of
suits
in
the
district
courts
where
teachers
who
are
denied
tenure
or
appointment
do
follow
a
scorched-earth
policy.
and
the
privilege
argument
mr.
lee
is
advancing
to
us
would
cover
that.
