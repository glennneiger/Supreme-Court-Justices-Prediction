we'll

argument
next
in
number

kansas
and
missouri
v.
utilicorp
united,
inc.--
mr.
greenan.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
greenan,
you
say
the
100
percent
pass-on
is
required
from
the
wellhead
to
the
burner.
you're
saying,
then,
i
take
it,
the
utility
corp...
utility
commission
in
the
state
must
require
that
a
utility
pass
on
all
of
the
cost?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
is
that
a
federal
rule?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
it
were
just
a
state
rule,
i
suppose
some
states
might
have
it
and
some
states
might
not.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
what
you
are
speaking
then
is...
from
wellhead
to
burner,
is
true
of
residential
consumers
in
kansas
and
missouri?
chief
justice
rehnquist
40
states--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--by
virtue
of
the
rulings
of
public
utility
commissions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
voluntary
dismissal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
as
to
the
consumers
in
eastern
kansas
that
you
are...
were
they
served
by
a
utility
which
would
have
had
a
claim,
but
the
utility--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--simply
didn't
bring
a
lawsuit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
is
just
federal,
what
you
are
referring
to
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
greenan.
mr.
finch.
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
the
parens
patriae
amendment
to
the
antitrust
laws,
mr.
finch,
bar
a
claim
by
individual
consumers?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
finch.
mr.
robbins.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
won't
those
same
difficulties
stand
in
the
way
of
the
utilities'
recovering
lost
profits?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
robbins.
mr.
greenan,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
greenan.
the
case
is
submitted.
