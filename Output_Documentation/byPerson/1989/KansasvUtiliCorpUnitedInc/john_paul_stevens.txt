justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
there?
is
it
clear
that
treble
damages
will
all
go
to
the
end-users
if
they
prevail?
has
that
ever
been
decided
by--
justice
stevens
--so
how
can--
justice
stevens
--well,
it
seems
to
me
it's
an
unresolved
question,
what
happens
to
the
two-thirds
profit
in
treble
damage
litigation.
justice
stevens
but
even
in
the
residential
consumer,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
there
are
some
people
who
turn
the
thermostat
down
and
have
to
buy
an
extra
sweater.
justice
stevens
and
there
is
no
way
they
can
recover
for
that
sweater.
justice
stevens
does
the
mechanism
also
work
for
price
decreases?
justice
stevens
of
course,
if
we
don't
decide
that
question
the
case
doesn't
mean
very
much,
does
it?
justice
stevens
if
we
do
not
decide
the
4(c)
issue,
there
is
not
much
to
this
lawsuit,
as
far
as
for
long-run
precedential
purposes.
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
if
we
leave
out
in
the...
if
we
rule
the
way
you
recommend
that
we
rule,
and
don't
decide
the
4(c)
question,
you
are
going
to
have
this
same
problem
come
up
again
in
the
next
lawsuit.
