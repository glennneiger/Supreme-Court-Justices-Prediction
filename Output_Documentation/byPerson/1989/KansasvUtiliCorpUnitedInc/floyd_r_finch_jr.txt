mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
must
disagree
with
mr.
greenan
about
a
number
of
issues,
first
about
what
the
issue
of
federal
antitrust
policy
is
before
the
court
today.
the
issue
as
we
see
it
is
whether
this
court
will
continue
to
consolidate
antitrust
damage
claims
in
an
injured
direct
purchaser,
or
whether
it
will
cloud
the
clear
direct
purchaser
rule
of
illinois
brick
by
creating
a
regulated
utility
exception.
there
is
no
need,
we
submit,
in
this
case
to
change
the
direct
purchaser
rule,
which
has
been
clear
since
1968
at
least,
because
in
this
case
we
have
over
85
percent
of
the
antitrust
damages
being
pursued
by
kpl,
which
has
over
75
percent
of
the
damage
claims,
by
utilicorp,
with
about
5
percent,
and
by
the
other
municipal
utilities
which
are
represented,
properly
so,
we
contend--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--well,
justice
o'connor,
if
i
may,
it's
not
true
that
100
percent
is
passed
on
to
the
customers.
it
simply
isn't
true,
and
that's
one
point--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--if
it
were,
then,
i
submit
that
this
is
the
perfect
case
not
to
make
an
exception,
because
you
would
have
a
utility
regulatory
commission
that
can
force
those
overcharges
to
be
passed
on
to
the
people
who
actually
paid
them.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
they
can
be
identified--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--it
is
different,
but
i
must
point
out
that
there
is
no
precise
identification.
i
must
disagree
with
mr.
greenan
on
that
score.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
because
the
utility
bills
do
not
reflect
all
of
the
overcharge,
justice
o'connor.
first,
utilicorp
uses
natural
gas
itself.
it
is
a
direct
purchaser.
it
uses
it
to
heat
its
facilities,
and
it
uses
it
in
peaking
units
where
it
generates
electricity.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
we
know
that
the
consumers
ultimately
paid
a
majority...
by
the
consumers,
i
mean
all
consumers.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes,
justice
white,
we
do
know
that.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
well,
we--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--at
the
close
of
discovery
in
the
summer
of
1989
our
experts
were
finally
able
to
determine
the
amount
of
the
overcharge.
the
suit
was
filed
in
1984,
and
it
took
approximately
five
years
for
that
determination
to
be
made.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes.
indeed
it
was
made.
but
one
thing
that
hasn't
been
made,
justice
white,
is
a
determination,
an
actual
factual
determination
that
100
percent
of
the
overcharge
was
passed
on
to
all
of
the
customers.
that
was
assumed
in
the
tenth
circuit
opinion.
the
district
court
did
not
find
that,
and
there
has
never
been
a
finding
on
that
in
this
case.
in
fact,
i
would
submit
that
there...
that
not
100
percent
of
the
overcharges
were
passed
on,
but
some
lesser
number.
there
are,
for
example,
line
losses,
in
that
when
you
have
pipes
running
all
over
the
countryside,
gas
leaks
out.
and
it
doesn't
get
billed
to
consumers.
utilicorp
pays
for
the
natural
gas
when
it...
at
the
wellhead
when
it
purchases
gas.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
well,
it
could
be
determined,
justice
white.
it
has
not
been
determined
in
this
case.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
well,
i
submit
it
would
not
be
easy.
the
purchased-gas
adjustment
clauses
are
based
on
estimates,
and
what
happens
is
that
on
a
particular
day
the
supplier
announces
that
in
30
days
its
price
is
going
to
go
up
to
x
amount
per
mcf,
the
word
you're
looking
for,
a
thousand
cubic
feet.
and
the
court...
the
company
then
estimates
how
much
its
gas
cost
per
customer,
per
customer
class
will
have
to
go
up.
but
those
are
only
estimates.
and
there
has
to
be
an
additional
procedure
that
is
gone
through
later
in
the
year
where
you
try
to
true
that
up.
and
i
will
certainly
agree
that
there
is
an
effort
to
true
it
up,
to
make
it
the
same.
but
it
is
not
something
that
was
determinable
at
the
time
this
litigation
was
started.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes,
justice
white,
in
fact--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--yes.
there
will
have
to
be
some
sort
of
a
determination
made
at
that
point,
or
at
least
a
reasonable
estimate.
but
i
think
the
point
is--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--if
you
were
to
look
at
each
individual
customer
[inaudible]--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--and
then...
but
i
guess
my
point
is,
justice
o'connor,
that
there
is
a
damage
to
utilicorp.
it
is
an
injured
direct
purchaser.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
have
never
suggested
that
residential
customers,
and
indeed
industrial
and
commercial
customers,
were
not
damaged
to
some
extent
by
defendant's
action.
that
is
why
i
go
back
to
my
original
point,
the
question
is
of
antitrust
policy.
do
you
want
to
continue,
as
in
illinois
brick,
concentrating
the
damage
recovery
in
one
party,
so
that
that
party
will
have
the
greatest
incentive
to
sue,
so
that
you
will
minimize
the
complexities
that
we
have
been
talking
about
here.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
justice
kennedy,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
from
which
that
could
be
determined.
it
was
assumed
by
the
trial
court,
and
there
could
have
been
discovery
on
it.
i
can
give
you
an
idea
that
you
are
correct
that
it
would
be
a
relatively
small
number,
that
most
of
the
overcharges
were
then
passed
on
to
the
customers.
but
you
get
into
a
problem
of
allocation.
remember,
we
are
talking
about
a
preliminary
question
here
of,
not
quite
standing,
but
antitrust
injury.
and
the
way
we
got
into
this
was
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
case
we
filed
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
against
not
the
states,
but
against
the
defendants
on
the
pass-on
defense.
because
the
defendants
were
saying
you
don't
have
a
right
to
recover
anything
in
this
case.
and
so,
instead
of
having
us
litigate
the
issue
of
allocation
which
you
have
raised,
and
try
to
determine
well,
utilicorp
has
got
2
percent
of
the
total
overcharges,
whatever
that
number
may
be,
the
district
court
quite
properly
concluded,
under
the
doctrine
of
illinois
brick,
that
there
should
just
be...
an
antitrust
damage
claim
should
be
concentrated
in
the
direct
purchaser.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes,
justice
scalia?
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
justice
scalia,
that
is
a
substantial
number.
in
the
case
of
kpl
it
is
over
$15
million,
according
to
the
experts.
in
the
case
of
utilicorp
it
is
over
$4
million
of
lost
margin
damages.
now,
that
does
not
include
whatever
additional
damages
the
utility
suffered
by
paying
more
for
gas
that
they
did
not
resell
to
consumers.
but
it
is
a
substantial
number.
and
though
the
states
make
much
of
our
incentive
to
bring
this
case,
in
fact
it
was
kpl,
the
first
direct
purchaser,
who
brought
the
lawsuit
in
1984.
and
it
wasn't
until
several
months
later
that
the
states
of
missouri
and
kansas
did
join
in
the
suit.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
treble
damages
and
protecting
our
market,
justice
scalia.
because,
as
you
point
out,
if
you
are
a
residential
home
owner,
for
example,
and
you
put
more
insulation
in
your
attic,
we
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
sell
you
as
much
gas
in
the
future.
it's
not
just
an
immediate
downturn
because
we
have
been
able
to
sell
you
gas
in
the
past
and
we'll
get
that
back,
because
we
have
lost
market
for
the
long
term.
and
that
is
particularly
also
true
for
the
commercial
and
industrial
customers.
if
a
home
owner
goes
out
and
installs
a
wood
burning
fireplace
in
his
house
and
starts
burning
a
lot
of
wood,
that
is
demand
loss
to
us.
that
is
a
loss
to
our
margin
permanently.
now,
mr.
greenan
suggested
that
we
could
go
back
to
the
utility
commissions
and
try
to
get
some
of
this
margin
back.
but
in
fact
utilicorp,
particularly
the
missouri
public
service
division,
did
not
have
a
rate
case
between
1983
and
1988,
the
major
portion
of
the
damage
period.
and
we
do
believe
that
the
company
suffered
substantial
damages,
and
it
was
certainly
enough
to
cause
us
to
bring
this
suit.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes,
they
would.
and
i
guess
the
question
is
what
incentive
is
enough,
and
what
level
of
complexity
and
what
level
of
expense
is
enough.
mr.
greenan
pointed
out
that
utilicorp
dropped
out
of
the
case
for
a
while.
i
wasn't
privy
to
that
decision;
i
don't
know
why
it
was
made.
but
i
suggest
that
part
of
the
reason
may
well
have
been
the
concern
that
you
just
raised,
justice
o'connor,
that
when
you
don't
know
how
much
of
it
you
are
going
to
be
allowed
to
recover,
and
when
you
know
there
is
going
to
be
tremendous
expense
right
up
front
in
the
litigation,
litigating
about
whether
you
can
even
be
involved
in
the
case,
that
is
a
tremendous
disincentive
that
this
court
frowned
upon
in
illinois
brick,
and
should
continue
to
frown
upon,
we
submit.
the
question
that
justice
scalia
raised
about
who
recovers
for
the
industrial
and
commercial
customers
should
be
a
significant
one
on
the
court's
mind,
for,
after
all,
there
is
some
inconsistency
here
in
the
states'
position.
they
say
well,
when
it
comes
to
residential
customers,
we
or
the
consumers
themselves,
can
sue.
but
when
it
comes
to
industrial
and
commercial
customers,
then
the
utilities
can
sue.
as
justice
posner
suggested,
because
perhaps
the
utilities
ate
some
of
the
overcharges,
didn't
pass
along
all
the
overcharges.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
industrial
and
commercial
customers
of
these
two
parties,
utilicorp
and
kpl,
have
not
sued,
probably,
i
would
submit,
in
reliance
upon
illinois
brick
and
the
fact
that
they
would
be
entitled
under
the
utility
regulatory
scheme
to
get
back
a
large
part
of
their
damages.
so
we
have
a
question
of
equity
and
justice
here
for
those
customers
whose
claims
would
now
be
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
it
does
not,
as
i
read
it,
justice
rehnquist,
bar
a
claim
by
individual
consumers,
but
the
states,
when
they
file
their
lawsuit,
are
supposed
to
have
given
individual
consumers
notice
so
they
could
opt
out.
in
fact
that
has
never
been
done
in
this
case,
even
though
the
states
filed
their
claims
back
in
1985
and
1986.
so
we
don't
know,
if
there
was
such
a
notice
given,
how
many
consumers
might
well
choose
to
opt
out
and
pursue
their
own
litigation.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
want
to
point
out,
if
you...
if
the
court
would
like
to
discuss
the
argument
that
section
4(c)
allows
the
state
attorneys
general
to
bring
this
case,
that
it
was
not
raised
in
the
court
below.
it
was
not
presented
in
the
certiorari
petition
before
this
court.
moreover,
i
would
suggest
the
court
has
already
rejected
that
argument
in
footnote
14
of
illinois
brick.
indeed
it
would
be
an
odd
statutory
construction,
if
section
4(c)
is
based
on
section
4,
to
have
a
rule
like
in
illinois
brick,
that
an
indirect
purchaser
cannot
sue
under
section
4,
but
under
section
4(c)
a
state
may
sue
on
behalf
of
that
indirect
purchaser.
and
indeed,
the
statute
doesn't
make
any
sense
that
way,
for
if
you
allow
a
consumer
to
opt
out
under
section
4(c),
but
you
don't
give
him
the
right
to
sue
under
section
4,
it's
just
internally
inconsistent.
apparently
there
was
the
assumption
of
some
congressman
in
1976
that
illinois
brick
might
have
come
out
the
other
way.
but
i
think
the
states
have
recognized,
by
their
efforts
to
go
back
to
congress
and
get
illinois
brick
changed,
that
in
fact
congress
did
not
authorize
in
section
4(c)
parens
patriae
suits
on
behalf
of
indirect
purchasers.
surely
the
proof
that
congress
has
not
acted
shows
there
is
no
strong
sentiment
in
congress
for
changing
the
direct
purchaser
rule
that
this
court
enunciated
in
illinois
brick.
in
this
case,
i
contend
that
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws
is...
are
best
served
by
concentrating
the
recovery
in
the
direct
purchaser,
instead
of
splintering
the
recovery
among
industrial
customers,
commercial
customers,
the
state
attorney
generals
or
any
consumers
who
may
bring
their
own
cases.
the
incentive
should
be
maximized,
so
the
deterrent
will
be
maximized.
i
point
out
that
one
of
the
concerns
in
illinois
brick
was
that
the
direct
purchaser
should
have
the
best
knowledge,
and
that
is...
does
appear
to
be
what
happened
in
this
case,
in
that
the
kansas
power
and
light
company,
the
direct
purchaser,
did
the
investigation
and
filed
the
antitrust
suit,
and
the
states,
and
for
that
matter
utilicorp,
piggybacked
in
on
kpl's
work
product.
i
point
out
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
utilities
have
gotten
it
right.
they
have
sued
for
treble
damages
to
protect
their
market,
and
to
some
extent,
i
suppose,
out
of
a
sense
of
public
service
duty
that
a
public
service
commission
has.
but
if
this
court
were
to
take
away
50
to
95
percent
of
this
recovery,
i
would
ask
how
much
of
an
enthusiastic
plaintiff
will
a
utility
be
the
next
time
around,
the
next
time
there's
an
antitrust
case.
i
would
submit
that
the
ruling
of
the
tenth
circuit
should
be
upheld.
