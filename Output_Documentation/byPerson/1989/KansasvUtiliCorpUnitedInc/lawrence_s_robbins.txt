mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
with
respect,
i
believe
mr.
greenan
has
misformulated
the
question
before
the
court.
the
rule
of
illinois
brick
is
not
that
the
direct
purchaser
is
the
proper
party
to
sue
unless
it
is
easy
to
demonstrate
that
there
has
been
no
absorption
of
the
overcharge.
the
rule
in
illinois
brick
is
as
follows,
that
with
a
cost-plus
contract
the
purchaser
is
insulated
from
any
decrease
in
its
sales
as
a
result
of
attempting
to
pass
on
the
overcharge,
because
its
customer
is
committed
to
buying
a
fixed
quantity,
regardless
of
price.
even
if
it
were
the
case
that
the
regulatory
framework
in
which
this
case
comes
before
the
court
solved
the
problem
of
apportionment,
that
would
only
be
the
tip
of
the
iceberg.
illinois
brick
is
not
simply
about
the
apportionment
of
overcharges.
instead,
illinois
brick
and
hanover
shoe
stem
from
a
longer
tradition
in
which
this
court
has
uniformly
held
that
an
injured
direct
purchaser
is
entitled
to
sue
for
the
entire
overcharge,
regardless
of
whether
and
to
what
extent
that
direct
purchaser
passes
on
the
overcharge
to
its
customers.
it
is
that
tradition
that
hanover
shoe
and
illinois
brick
dealt
with
when
it
adverted
to
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
a
cost-plus
exception.
now,
one
thing
is
perfectly
clear.
if
there
is
a
cost-plus
exception,
it
does
not
cover
this
case,
because,
as
petitioners
freely
concede,
the
direct
purchaser
in
this
case
was
injured.
it
suffered
the
loss
of
profits
as
a
result
of
having
to
pass
on
an
overcharge,
to
whatever
extent
it
did,
to
its
customers.
and
so,
what
is
clear
beyond,
i
think,
contradiction,
is
that
if
there
is
to
be
an
exception
to
cover
this
case,
it
will
be
a
new
exception,
an
exception
that
departs
from
the
tradition
that
has
always
held
that
an
injured
direct
purchaser,
injured
in
any
form,
injured
by
the
overcharge
or
injured
by
lost
profits,
and
lost
profits
are
not
contravened
in
this
case,
is
entitled
to
sue
for
the
entire
overcharge.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
and
keep
it.
now,
it
seems
to
me,
justice
white,
and
this
returns
also
to
the
question
justice
o'connor
raised
before:
is
this
a
windfall.
well,
in
one
sense
i
suppose
it
is
a
windfall,
but
it
was
a
windfall
that
this
court
recognized
and
anticipated
the
possibility
of
in
illinois
brick,
recognizing
that
it
may
well
be
the
case
that
some
indirect
purchasers
who
suffered
an
injury
may
not
be
compensated.
but
that
was
anticipated
for
a
reason,
anticipated
because
the
court
concluded,
as
it
had
in
hanover
shoe,
that
locating
and
maximizing
the
incentive
in
the
direct
purchaser
is
the
best
policy
for
the
antitrust
laws,
seeking
the
maximum
deterrence
at
the
most
efficient
price.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
the
language,
to
be
sure,
justice
o'connor,
is
quite
sweeping.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
but
that
was
equally
true,
i
might
suggest,
in
associated
general
contractors,
where
the
court
took
that
issue
on
directly
and
said
that
there
are
a
variety
of
limiting
principles
that
have
always
been
used
to
constrain
what
would
otherwise
be
the
sweeping
embrace
of
section
4.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think
the
answer
is
yes,
it's
possible.
it
is
not,
however,
easy.
it
will
be
possible
after
litigation
about
the
very
issues
that
concerned
the
court
in
illinois
brick.
in
the
first
place,
it
will
not
be
easy
to
decide
even
the
question
of
apportionment
that
is
supposedly
solved
by
the
regulatory
frame
work.
and,
by
the
way,
that
is
the
only
policy
that
is
solved
at
all.
so
if
it
doesn't
even
solve
that
problem
free
of
litigation,
it
hasn't
done
very
much.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
it
is
not
hard
to
say
that,
but
it
won't
be
correct.
and
it
may
not
be
correct
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
you
are
going
to
have
litigation
about
whether
the
regulation
in
fact
requires
the
utility
to
pass
it
on.
these
parties
are
in
dispute
about
that
very
question.
the...
the
pja
clauses
throughout
the
states
may
be
different.
they
may
be
hard
to
read.
and
you
are
going
to
have
litigation
about
whether
it
is
even
required.
you
will
then
have
litigation
about
whether
it
has
been
complied
with.
what
looks
like
a
dollar-for-dollar
pass-through
may
be
nothing
more
than
the
postponement
of
the
rate
increase
that
would
have
come
about
anyway,
a
concern
which
this
court
expressly
identified
in
hanover
shoe.
what
looks
like
a
pass-through
may
be
an
increase
for
other
reasons.
but
even
if
they
had
solved
the
apportionment
problem,
and
they
haven't...
they
haven't
solved
it
with
the
ease
that
hanover
shoe
requires,
you
then
have
a
variety
of
other
problems
that
they
haven't
come
close
to
solving,
and
indeed
in
some
respects
have
made
worse.
the
complication
of
litigation.
it
is
not
going
to
go
away,
it
is
going
to
come
back
fourfold.
it's
going
to
come
back
because
you
are
going
to
increase
the
number
of
litigants
in
court.
you
are
going
to
increase
the
kinds
of
damages
they
are
seeking.
the
indirect
purchasers
will
seek
the
overcharge.
the
direct
purchasers
will
sue
either
for
the
lost
profits
and,
as
petitioners
have
conceded
this
morning,
some
portion
of
the
overcharge
for
unrepresented
customers
that
the
state's
parens
patriae
can't...
can't
represent.
lost
profits
are
very
hard
to
calculate,
because
they
require
you
to
prove
the
overcharge,
and
then
calculate
the
effect
of
the
overcharge
on
the
demand
curve,
how
inelastic
or
elastic
is
the
demand,
the
very
thing
this
court
wanted
to
get
away
from
in
illinois
brick.
as
a
consequence
of
the
proliferation
of
parties
and
the
complication
of
the
damage
theories,
you
will
do
a
couple
of
other
things.
you'll
reduce
the
incentives
on
direct
purchasers--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
in
our
view,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
direct
purchasers
are
in
that
lawsuit
alone
they
may
attempt
to
seek
both
kinds
of
damages.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
because
the
overcharge
will
always
be
greater
than,
or
at
worst
equal
to,
the
lost
profits,
they
will
tend
in
the
aggregate
to
seek
only
the
overcharge.
and
as
a
result,
the
more
complicated
inquiry
for
lost
profits
will
in
the
main
wash
away.
there
will
also
not
be
competing
claims
for
the
same
total
recovery,
a
concern
that
this
court
articulated
in
arc
america.
you
will
not
have
two
or
more
categories
of
plaintiffs
suing
over
a
common
federal
pot
under
section
4.
and
that
competing
claim,
and
the
proliferation
of
theories
and
parties
that
will
inevitably
ensue,
and
only
gets
worse
under
petitioners'
theory,
is
what
is
going
to
ultimately
dilute
the
intended
incentive
on
the
direct
purchasers
to
sue.
what
is
more,
finally,
i
think,
if
you
open
the
door
the
crack
that
they
seek
this
morning,
there
will
be
many
more
exceptions
brought
to
your
doorstep.
if
today
it's
100
percent
regulation,
tomorrow
it
will
be
a
95
percent
regulation,
because
in
theory
there
is
no
greater
reason
why
the
95
percent
pass-through
plaintiffs
shouldn't
be
in
court
as
well.
and
it
is
precisely
that
concern,
i
suggest,
that
caused
this
court
to
hesitate
to
even
say
whether
there
is
any
cost-plus
exception
at
all.
in
each
of
the
court's
cases
the
suggestion
has
been
that
there
might
be
such
an
exception.
and
i
think
that
hesitation
makes
a
good
deal
of
sense,
because
in
a
case
in
which
it's
not
required
to
reach
that
result,
it
ought
not
to
be
reached.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no.
i
think
it
is
not
here.
it
was
not
in
the
question
presented,
it
was
not
resolved
below,
and
it
is
not
for
this
court
to
decide.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
we
think
that
this
court
resolved
the
question
and
resolved
it
correctly
in
footnote
14
of
illinois
brick.
and
we
think
that
the
same
answer
on
that...
on...
on
the
merits,
if
appropriate,
should
apply
here.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
am
sorry,
justice?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
there
is
still
the
claim,
which
we
think
is
mistaken,
that
section
4
and
the
suggested
cost-plus
exception
is
sufficient
to
cover
this
case
even
if
4(c)
isn't
recurred
to.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
may,
with
a
party
that
has
chosen
to
rely
on
4(c),
and
at
that
time
i
suspect
our
answer
will
be
the
same
as
to
the
4(c)
question.
but
that's
not
here,
and
i
think
for
good
reason.
now,
it
may
be
that
in
the
end
petitioners'
clients
bore
some
or
most
of
the
overcharge.
and
it
may
also
be
that
the
regulatory
framework
alleviates
to
some
extent
some,
but
hardly
all,
of
the
concerns
in
illinois
brick.
but
this
court
has
anticipated
such
possibilities
and
has
refused
to
carve
out
an
exception
for
particular
markets.
it
has
discouraged
that
venture
at
every
turn.
there
is
every
reason
to
do
so
this
morning.
