justice
white
so
you
say
that
you
can
concede
easily
that
the...
both
the
utility
and
the
consumer
has
been
hurt,
but
at
least
you
know
for
sure,
because
the
law
requires
the
pass-on,
exactly
how
much
the
consumer
has
been
hurt.
justice
white
now,
you
wouldn't...
you
wouldn't...
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
the
law
did
not
require
the
pass-on?
justice
white
because
then
you
really
would
get
into
a
real
bog,
wouldn't
you?
justice
white
your
opposition
suggests
that
if
the
utility
recovers,
makes
the
entire
recovery,
that
it
would
have
to
pass
on
to
the
consumer
the
windfall.
justice
white
i
know.
i
know,
but
i
would
suppose...
do
you
agree
that
they
would
have
to?
justice
white
but
if
it
is,
then
there
would
be
the
problem
right
there
of
separating
out
the
two
injuries.
justice
white
well,
it
wouldn't
be
any
problem
at
all
if
you
know
precisely
how
much
was
passed
on.
justice
white
but
if
they
would...
but
if...
even
assuming
that
they
would
do
that,
why
then,
then
the
assumption
is
that
you
can
identify
easily
how
much
was
passed
on.
justice
white
but
the
problem
isn't
all
that
easy,
because
you
don't
know
what
the
[inaudible]
is.
until
you
have
a
lawsuit.
justice
white
you
don't
know
how
much
the
price
went
up.
justice
white
that
may
be,
but
who's
going
to...
who's
going
to
take
on
that
job
of
proving
the
conspiracy
and
the
result
on
competition?
justice
white
and
as
you...
you
say
that
a
group
of
consumers
could
bring
the
same
suit
you
could,
and
they
would
not
be
barred
by
illinois
brick?
justice
white
well,
what
do
you
mean
that
it
was
required
by
law
to
pass
it
on?
justice
white
because
they
have
to...
to
set
their
rate
they
have
to
tell--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
and
you
have
identified
the
statutory
requirement
in
your--
justice
white
--okay.
justice
white
so
you
can
identify
them?
justice
white
which
is
completely
different
from
the
illinois
brick
type
of
case.
justice
white
well,
it
may
be
that
100
percent
of
the
damages
aren't
passed
on,
but
you
know
to
the...
you
know
the
extent
to
which
the
consumer
has
been
damaged.
justice
white
you
know
that
the...
that
because
the
price
to
the
utility
went
up,
that
the
price
to
the
consumer
went
up
also,
to
some
extent.
justice
white
and
you
know
precisely
how
much.
justice
white
once
you
find
out
what
the...
what
the
price
would
have
been.
justice
white
but
you
made
it.
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
you
know,
you
determined
after
five
years
that
if
it
hadn't
been
for
this
conspiracy
the
price
would
have
been
lower.
justice
white
and
so
let's
assume
that
it
would
have
been
a
dollar
lower
per
whatever
kind
of
a
unit
you
are
talking
about.
now,
you
say
that
a
hundred...
that
it
is
not
clear
in
this
record
that
100
percent
of
that
dollar
was
passed
on
to
the
consumer?
justice
white
but
you
do
know
how
much
of
it
was.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
wouldn't
it
be
easy
to
do?
justice
white
well,
how
would
it
ever
be
determinable
later
if
you
say
that...
let's
assume
you
recover
from
the
pipeline
x
million
dollars,
and
you
say
that
you
know
that
some
of
it
was
passed
on.
and
you
say
the
utility
commission
could
force
you
to
pass
on
to
the
consumer
part
of
your
recovery.
justice
white
well,
wouldn't
you
have
to
then
determine
how
much
it
was?
justice
white
do
you
think
the
4(c)
issue
is
here
properly?
justice
white
and
you
don't
have
any
view
on
it
anyway,
or
do
you?
justice
white
xxx
the
answer
to
4(c),
i
suppose,
is
that
if...
is
that
the
consumer
under
illinois
brick
hasn't
suffered
any
injury.
justice
white
well,
what
does...
what
does
4(c)
authorize?
justice
white
well,
they
can...
they
can
attempt
to
recover
the
damages
that
the
indirect
purchasers
couldn't
recover
themselves.
but
if
the
indirect
purchasers
can't
recover
any
damages,
what
good
is
parens
patriae
action?
justice
white
to
recover
what?
justice
white
well,
you
have
to
say
both
indirect
and
direct,
but
that
isn't
what
it
says.
