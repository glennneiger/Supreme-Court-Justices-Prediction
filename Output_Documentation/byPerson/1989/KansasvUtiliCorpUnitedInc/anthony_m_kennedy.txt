justice
kennedy
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
give
us
an
idea
of
the
percentage
of
these...
of
the
total
damages
that
were
absorbed
by
the
utility
directly?
when
you
talk
about
some
of
the
gas
being
lost
in
the
pipeline,
and
the
fact
that
you
have
to
heat
your
own
facilities.
i
am
thinking
de
minimis,
but
is
there
some
way
you
can
give
me
an
estimate
of
what
percentage
of
the
damages
were
absorbed
by
the
utility
itself?
justice
kennedy
you
say
they
are
supposed
to
give
notice.
under
the
statute?
