justice
scalia
yes,
but
that...
but
that
return,
as
i
understand
it,
unless
these
rate-making
bodies
operate
quite
differently
from
what
i
am
familiar
with,
that
rate
is
established
now
for
next
year.
justice
scalia
isn't
that
right?
so
next
year,
if
i
end
up
selling
more
gas
than
the
state
really
expected
me
to
sell,
i
keep
the
difference.
right?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
the
effect
of
regulatory
lag
is
that
if
i
sell
more
gas
i
get
the...
now,
the
state
will
get
back
at
me
the
next
time
we
have
a
rate
making,
right,
and
they
will
cut
it
back
down.
but
i
get
a
profit
on
the
basis
of
selling
more
gas
than
the
state
expected
me
to
sell.
and
i
lose
money
by
selling
less
gas
than
the
state
expected
me
to
sell.
justice
scalia
well,
but
life
is
in
the
short
run.
we
are
just
talking
annual
profits
here.
justice
scalia
in
the
future.
justice
scalia
in
the
future.
but
it
has
lost
the
money
for
the
past
if...
if
its
volume
of
sales
has
gone
down
because
its
rates
have
been
higher.
justice
scalia
oh,
i...
i
agree
with
that.
justice
scalia
but
it
does
not
demonstrate...
you
answered
justice
o'connor
by
saying
that
the
illinois
brick
theory
was
if
you
can
be
sure
that
the
intermediate
purchaser
has
not
been
harmed
it's...
it's
okay
to
apply
illinois
brick.
but
we
can't
be
sure
that
the
intermediate
purchaser
here
has
not
been
harmed,
can
we?
justice
scalia
but
he
does
absorb
some
of
the...
of
the
overcharge,
does
he
not,
if
he
loses
sales
by
reason
of
the
overcharge?
if
he
is
selling
a
product
that
not
as
many
people
buy,
and
therefore
he
loses
some
of
the
profit
he
would
otherwise
have
made.
justice
scalia
well,
if
everybody
else
ends
up
winning
these
cases,
i
assume
that
the
regulating
authority
could
make
that
utility
pay
dearly
for
not...
for
not
having
brought
a
suit,
and
simply
say
you'll...
you'll
not
be
allowed
to
charge
as
much
next
time
around,
in
order
that
the
consumers
whose
money
you
have
frittered
away
can
be
made
whole.
justice
scalia
but
why?
it
would
be
considered
not
sound
business
practices.
you
have
been
running
a
sloppy
operation,
not
bringing
suits
for
money
that
you're
entitled
to.
justice
scalia
mr.
greenan,
what
does
the
state
do
with
the
money?
you
sue
as
parens
patriae,
do
you
get
it
back
to
the
actual
people
who
were
overcharged,
or
does
it
go
into
the
general
state
funds?
what...
what
happens
to
it?
justice
scalia
either
one.
justice
scalia
which
wouldn't
necessarily
be
rate
payers.
justice
scalia
and
anybody
that
has
moved
out
of
the
state
since
these
overcharges
were
made,
they
are
just
out
of
luck,
i
guess,
if
they
have
moved
to
new
jersey?
justice
scalia
what
happens
to
the
commercial
purchasers,
mr.
greenan?
you
say
that
this
is
just
residential
purchasers.
what
about
the
overcharges
made
that
were
passed
through
to
commercial
purchasers?
how...
what
happens
to
that
if
you
win
this
case?
justice
scalia
could
they
bring
suits
on
their
own,
not
relying
on
the
state's
parens
patriae?
justice
scalia
what
if
i
am
an
individual
commercial
purchaser
that
doesn't
have
that
capacity?
why
shouldn't
i
be
able
to
sue?
justice
scalia
i
don't
either.
justice
scalia
mr.
finch--
justice
scalia
--you
say
that
it
is
likely
to
have
been
minimal,
the
amount
of
the
overcharge
that
was
passed
on.
is
it
likely
to
have
been
minimal
the
damage
suffered
by
the
utilities,
which
would
include
the
amount
of
the
overcharge
that
wasn't
passed
on
plus
other
damages,
such
as
their
loss
of
additional
sales
that
might
have
been
made
because
of
the
commercial
users
who
are
convertible
and
switch
to
some
other
fuel,
and...
and
the
residential
users,
if
one
could
ever
figure
that
out,
who
put
on
sweaters?
justice
scalia
what
is
in
it
for
you
if
you
have
to
pass
it
on
to
the
consumers?
