justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
they
could
just
turn
the
register
down
and
be
a
little
colder
in
the
winter
and
a
little
hotter
in
the
summer.
justice
o'connor
and
might
affect
the
total
usage.
justice
o'connor
so
this
isn't
a
fixed
quantity
contract.
justice
o'connor
and
the
language,
at
least
in
illinois
brick,
referred
to
a
fixed
quantity
pass
through.
justice
o'connor
so
you
propose
that...
that
the
court
find
an
additional
exception
in--
justice
o'connor
--do
you
think
we
could
be
assured
that
the
residential
consumers
would
have
the
same
incentive
to
sue
that
the
court
found
was
important
in
illinois
brick
for
the...
in
this
case,
direct
purchasers,
the
utilities?
justice
o'connor
but
there
would
be
a
general
concern
by
the
court
if
we
are
to
articulate
a
general
rule.
is
there
any
empirical
indication
that
these
indirect
purchasers--
justice
o'connor
--would
vigorously
pursue?
justice
o'connor
i
guess
you
can
read
it
off
the
utility
bills
to
the--
justice
o'connor
--residential
consumer.
justice
o'connor
well,
we
have
no
indication
here
that
the
states
would
have
brought
the
lawsuit
on
their
own.
didn't
they
come
in
after
the
fact--
justice
o'connor
--after
the
utilities
had
filed
the
suit,
and
kind
of
piggybacked
on
their
suit?
justice
o'connor
do
we
know,
does
the
record
disclose
what
would
happen
to
the
recovery,
if
any,
if
the
states
were
allowed
to
proceed?
justice
o'connor
which
could
be
either,
keep
it
or
not.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
does
seem
to
be
pretty
much
a
windfall
to
the
utilities,
when
100
percent
of
it
is
passed
on
to
the
customers.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
it
were?
justice
o'connor
why
can't
you
read
it
off
the
utility
bills?
the
increase.
justice
o'connor
well,
then
at
the
end
of
the
year
when
the
utility
does
make
these
final
adjustments
on
the
customers'
bills,
you
can
look
at
the
bill
and
see
how
much
the
overcharge
was.
justice
o'connor
yes.
that's
possible
to
do.
it's
there.
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
that
is
a
separate
question.
admittedly
there
is
some
damage,
i
suppose,
to
the
utility
corporation
itself.
and
there
are
also
damages,
if
you
want
to
look
at
it
that
way,
by
the
reduction
in
demand
from
the
customers.
those
could
be
established,
i
suppose,
based
on
averages.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
finch,
even
if
we
agreed
with
the
states
that
in
this...
under
these
circumstances
the
residential
consumer
should
be
entitled
to
recover
the
pass-through,
the
utility
still
would
have
suffered
substantial
damage,
according
to
you,
and
still
would
have
an
incentive
to
be
in
this
suit.
justice
o'connor
of
course,
the
language
of
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
doesn't
make
the
distinction
the
court
has
made
in
hanover
shoe
and
illinois
brick.
this
is
just
a
court-created
doctrine.
justice
o'connor
it
is.
justice
o'connor
but
i
guess
the
real
question
is
whether,
in
a
case
like
this,
the
fundamental
concerns
that
motivated
the
court
in
illinois
brick
would
be
met
by
permitting
the
residential
consumers
to
sue.
justice
o'connor
you
can
separate
out
the
damages
that
they
suffered
by
the...
by
the
pass-through
of
the
overcharges.
it
is
possible
to
do
that
in
this
kind
of
case.
justice
o'connor
how
difficult
is
it
to
look
at
the
utility
bills
after
the
fact
and
say
that's
how
much
the
residential
consumers
had
to
pay
that
they
shouldn't
have
paid?
