mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
principal
question
before
the
court
this
morning
is
whether
or
not
the
rule
that
has
been
set
forth
in
hanover
shoe
v.
united
shoe
machinery,
and
in
illinois
brick
v.
illinois,
that
gives
the
claim
for
overcharges
in
an
antitrust
case
to
the
direct
purchaser
is
entirely
without
exception.
in
this
instance
we
are
talking
about
an
antitrust
case
involving
the
sale
of
natural
gas
by
regulated
utilities
from
the
wellheads
in
wyoming
to
residential
consumers
in
the
states
of
kansas
and
missouri.
we
have
a
situation
where
formal
cost-plus
pricing
is
the
rule.
we
have
an
extensive
system
of
federal
and
state
regulation
that
requires
a
100
percent
pass-on
of
any
increase
or
decrease
in
the
cost
of
natural
gas
from
the
wellhead
to
the
burner
tip.
we
have
in
place
a
contract
in
the
form
of
a
purchased-gas
adjustment
mechanism,
which
provides
that
that
pass-on
shall
be
complete
and
that
it
shall
be
immediate.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
yes,
your
honor.
the
purchased-gas
adjustment
mechanism
is
set
forth
at
tab
3
of
the
addendum
to
the
joint
brief
that
was
filed
in
the
tenth
circuit,
and
it
does...
it
is...
does
mandate
that
it
shall
be
passed
on.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
that
is
a
state
rule.
it
is
also
contained
in
the
purchased-gas
adjustment
mechanism
promulgated
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
no.
in
this
instance
the...
the
interstate
pipeline
is
regulated
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
their
purchased-gas
adjustment
mechanism
requires
a
pass
through.
in
this
particular
instance
the
states
of
kansas
and
missouri
are...
the
local
utility
distributors
are
regulated
by
their
state
commissions,
and
there
are
purchased-gas
adjustment
mechanisms
on
the
state
level
that
have
that
same
requirement.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
i
believe
that
it
is
established
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus,
the
state
of
illinois,
your
honor,
that
those
are
present
in
40
states.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
40
states.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
one
particular
item
of
interest
in
this
case
is
that
the
states
are
proceeding
parens
patriae
pursuant
to
15
u.s.c.
15(c),
and
in
that
instance
that
they
are
representing
residential
consumers
who
are
natural
persons
in
their
non-business
capacity.
these
residential
consumers,
the
record
is
clear,
do
not
have
the
ability
to
switch
to
alternative
fuels,
at
least
in
the
short
term.
they
have
in
place
their
heating
plants,
their
natural
gas
furnaces.
and
in
order
for
them
to
make
a
switch
to
an
alternative
type
of
fuel
it
would
be
necessary
to
change
to
some
other
type
of
heating
and
to
go
through--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--certainly.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
think
we
have
to
concede
that
that
in
fact
has
happened.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
it
is
not
a
fixed
quantity
contract.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
that
is
correct.
the
reference
in
illinois
brick
was
to
cost
plus
a
fixed
quantity.
the
reference--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--no,
i
think,
your
honor,
it
is
the
same
exception.
what...
the
way
the
court
described
it
in
illinois
brick
was
that
it
was
a
situation
where
it
would
be
easy
to
demonstrate
that
the
direct
purchaser
had
not
absorbed
any
part
of
the
overcharge,
but
that
it
had
been
passed
on.
and
in
that
instance
the
regulation
that
we
have
in
place
here
operates
exactly
as
does
a
cost-plus
fixed
quantity
contract.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
i
think
yes.
one
of
the
concerns
of
illinois
brick
was
that
there
be
vigorous
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws.
in
this
situation
we
have
the
attorneys
general
asking
permission
to
proceed
parens
patriae
on
behalf
of
the
residential
consumers,
so
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
concern.
we
have
chief
law
enforcement
officers--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--i
think
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
let's
put
them
side
by
side
with
the
utility.
what
we
have
to
understand
is
that
in
the
regulated
industry
the
utility
is
not
really
making
a
profit
on
buying
and
selling
natural
gas.
it
is
not
a
product
that
it
receives,
marks
up
and
passes
on.
rather,
it
carries
it
through
from
the
point
of
origin
to
the
consumer.
as
the...
testimony
of
mr.
david
black,
who
was
the
senior
vice
president
and
general
counsel
for
one
of
the
utilities
says,
we
merely
perform
a
transportation
service.
we
take
title
to
the
gas
for
the
few
hours
that
it
requires
for
us
to
get
it
from
the
wellhead
to
the
burner
tip,
and
then
we
charge
them
penny
for
penny,
dollar
for
dollar,
whatever
the
cost
is
to
us,
and
that
is
shown
forth
on
their
bill.
now,
if
that
is
the
situation,
the
utility
then
does
not
earn
a
profit
on
the
sale
of
natural
gas.
a
utility
makes
its
money
by
a
guaranteed
rate
of
return
on
its
invested
capital.
it
is
allowed
to
earn
so
much
to
return
that
investment,
and
so
much
by
way
of
a
return
on
the
investment.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
in
the
short
run,
that
is
true,
justice--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--that...
that
situation
is
unaffected
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
point
that
i
was
making
was
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
as
to
what
was
the
incentive
here.
and
your
honor
i
think
just
pointed
it
out
well.
in
the
rate-making
case,
the
rates
are
established
based
upon
what
level
of
sales
is
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
that
guaranteed
rate
of
return.
and
as
you
have
observed,
if
the
utility
sells
more
gas
than
it
had
expected,
it
keeps
that.
if
it
sells
less
gas
than
that
it
does
not
achieve
its
rate
of
return.
so
what
does
it
do?
it
goes
back
to
the
utility
commission
and
it
files
a
new
rate
case,
and
it
says
that
our
historic
sales
are
now
below
what
we
had
before.
we
need
a
higher
percentage--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--in
order
to
get
the
rate
of
return.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
exactly.
and
that
is
what
judge
posner,
in
the
panhandle
eastern
case,
said
was
a
lost
profits
damage
that
was
for
sales
that
were
not
made,
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
overcharge
for
the
sales
that
were
made
and
were
passed
on.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
okay.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
i
don't
believe
that
illinois
brick
says
that
you
can
be
sure
that
the
intermediate
purchaser
not
be
harmed.
what
illinois
brick
does
say
is
that
we
do
not
want
to
get
involved
in
the
questions
as
to
output
determinations
and
price
determinations
that
exist
in
the
real
world,
as
distinguished
from
the
economist's
model.
we
are
not
going
to
get
involved
in
the
interplay
of
supply
and
demand
forces
as
to
what
affect
prices.
but
illinois
brick
itself
said
if
it
can
be
easily
demonstrated
that
the
overcharge...
that
the
direct
purchaser
did
not
absorb
the
overcharge,
then
it
might
be
that
there
would
be
an
allowance
of
a
recovery
by
the
indirect
purchaser.
and
that
was
reaffirmed
by
the
court
recently
in
the
observations
that
were
made
in
california
v.
arc
america.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
he
loses
some
of
the
profit.
he
does
not
pay
any
of
the
overcharge.
and
that
is
the
point,
i
think,
the
real
point
of
distinction.
we
are
looking
at
several
things
with
illinois
brick.
we
want
vigorous
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
laws.
we
also
want
to
see,
if
it
is
possible,
that
the
people
who
were
injured
are
compensated.
in
this
particular
instance
there
is
no
difficulty
in
demonstrating
from
wellhead
to
burner
tip
that
that
overcharge
went
down
the
line
and
was
paid
by
the
people
at
the
end
of
the
line.
now,
if
the
utility
lost
profits
because
of
a
decline
in
sales,
then
that
is
a
claim
which
the
utility
has
and
which
the
utility
can
make.
this
court
has
never
been
concerned
with
whether
there
were
multiple
parties
in
antitrust
litigation.
this
court
has
never
said
that
we
are
going
to
only
allow
claims
for
overcharges,
or
that
we
are
only
going
to
allow
claims
for
lost
profits.
going
back
to
bigelow
and
storey
parchment,
all
of
the
seminal
cases
on
damages,
the
court
has
recognized
that
there
can
be
claims
for
lost
profits,
that
there
can
be
claims
for
decrease
in...
or
increase
in
the
amount
of
operating
costs,
that
there
can
be
claims
for
loss
of
investments,
and
all
of
these
are
separate
and
distinct
claims.
in
this
particular
instance,
justice
scalia,
the
proof
will
not
change
one
iota
by
giving
the
claim
to
the
residential
consumer.
the
utility
will
still
have
to
make
its
claims
and
make
its
proof
with
regard
to
those
lost
sales.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
no,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--yes.
we...
we
in
no
way,
your
honor,
are...
are
trying
to
deviate
from
what
the
court's
reasoning
was
in
illinois
brick.
we
have
here
a
mandated
pass-on
where,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
it's
easy
to
prove
that
the
direct
purchaser
did
not
absorb
the
overcharge.
and
in
that
instance
illinois
brick,
and
indeed
in
the
various
cases
that
the
court
has
referred
to
illinois
brick
since
then,
recognized
that
this
might
be
an
appropriate
situation.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
utilicorp
concedes
that,
your
honor.
the
government
says
that
they
can't
concede.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
i
think
that
is
a
question
that
is
up
to
the
various
regulatory
bodies.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
if...
if...
that
would
be
a
problem
on
the
administrative
level
if--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--we...
and
we
do
know,
of
course,
precisely
how
much
is
passed
on.
the...
the
question
of
what
the
regulatory
agencies
are
going
to
do
when
that
is
before
them
is
one
that
we
can
only
speculate
on.
the
government
chose
to
speculate
on
it
in
its
brief--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--certainly.
certainly.
you
can
identify
easily
how
much
was
passed
on
in
this
instance
without
a
doubt.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
you
can
read
it
off
the
utility
bills.
you
can
read
it--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--right.
there
are
forms,
referred
to
as
form
2s,
that
are
filed
with
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission
that
shows
how
much
the
pipeline
passed
on.
there
are
filings
that
are
made
by
the
local
utility
districts
of
the
various
state
regulators...
regulators
that
show
the
volumes
to
each
class
of
customer
and
the
prices
to
each
class
of
customer.
now,
one
major
problem
that
we
have
here
in
this
question
of
vigorous
enforcement
is
that
the
utilities
who
brought
this
litigation
do
not
represent
all
of
the
consumers
who
purchase
natural
gas
that
was
involved
in
this
alleged
illegal
price
fix.
we
have
a
significant
number
of
consumers,
some
50,000,
maybe
as
much
as
20
percent
of
the
gas
consumers
in
eastern
kansas,
who
purchased
from
utilities
other
than
the
ones
that
chose
to
bring
these
lawsuits.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
three
months
later.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
i
would
say
piggybacking
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
we
filed
three
months
after
the
first
case
was
filed.
the
first
case
was
filed
in
april
of
1985.
the
state
case
was
filed
in
july
of
1985,
i
believe.
utilicorp,
the
utility
that
is
here
before
the
court,
filed
their
case
in
1985,
dismissed
it
in
1986,
for
what
reason
only
they
can
tell
us--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--voluntary
dismissal.
and
then
asked
and
received
permission
to
file
again
in
october
of
1987,
very
shortly
before
these
motions
for
summary
judgment
were
brought.
now,
the
defendants
in
the
litigation
claim
that
their
claims,
the
claims
of
utilicorp,
are
time
barred.
and
indeed
it
appears
that
they
do
have
very
significant
statute
of
limitations
problems.
so
relying
upon
the
utilities
here
means,
first
of
all,
that
there
are
any
number
of
consumers
that
are
not
represented
by
the
utilities.
and
secondly,
if
it
is
the
utility
utilicorp
that
has
this
claim,
rather
than
the
attorneys
general
as
parens
patriae,
those
claims
may
well
be
time
barred.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
yes,
your
honor.
it's
union
natural
gas,
and
i
believe
it
is
at
tab
2
or
3
of
the
addendum
to
our
joint
brief.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
but
why?
but
why
would
the--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--but
why,
your
honor,
should
i,
the
utility,
bring
this
suit
when
you
are
going
to
make
me
disgorge,
if
that
is
the
situation?
why
should
i...
why
should
i
bring
this
suit
if
in
fact
it
is
going
to
go
back
to
the...
to
the
end-user?
after
all,
we
just
perform
a
transportation
service.
we
just
bring
this
stuff
down--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--it
has
never
been
decided.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
the
government
says...
the
government
says
we
don't
concede
that
a
regulator
would
make
them
give
up
the
double
and
triple
damages.
i
suggest
to
the
court
then
in...
in
an
instance
where
they
have
had
a
pass
through
dollar
for
dollar,
where
they
have
the
guaranteed
rate
of
return
so
that
they
can
come
back
to
have
their
rates
adjusted
within
a
short
period
of
time,
that
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
any
regulators
are
going
to
let
them
keep
that,
because
it
will
be
a
total
windfall
that
should
have
gone
to
the
people
that
paid
for
the
natural
gas.
but
we
don't
know.
it's...
it's
up
to
the
regulators.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
well,
those
two
alternatives
exist
under
15
u.s.c.
15(d),
i
believe,
your
honor...
or
15(a).
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
either
one.
either
that
it
goes
back
to
the
people,
or
that
it
goes
into
the
state
general
fund
for
the
benefit
of
everyone.
in
this--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--would
not
necessarily
be
rate
payers.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
probably,
if
they
have
moved
to
new
jersey.
but
the
most
likely
thing--
[laughter]
rather
than
some
other
state.
but
the
most
likely
thing
in
this
instance
is
that
because
these
people
who
do
now
still
live
within
kansas
or
missouri
and
purchase
natural
gas
within
those
states
are
known
and
can
be
identified,
that
the
recovery,
whatever
it
may
be,
can
be
returned
to
them,
either
in
the
form
of
dollars
or
in
the
form
of
reduced
charges
for
natural
gas
purchased
down
the
line.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
all
the
record
shows,
your
honor,
is
what
the
authority
is
under
the
parens
patriae
statutes.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
could
be
either.
yes,
could
be
either,
your
honor.
i
am
just
saying
that
the
most
likely,
because
of
the
easiness
with
which
to
identify
them.
and
i
believe
that
that
is
up
to
the
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
if
we
win
this
case,
your
honor,
that
belongs
to
the
utilities,
because
the
commercial
purchasers
are
neither
natural
persons
in
the
ordinary
sense,
and
they
are
businesses
which
doesn't
allow
parens
patriae
recovery.
but
also--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--they
could,
your
honor,
they
could,
but
i
think
they
would
be
faced
with
judge
posner's
reading,
judge
posner's
reasoning
as
to
why
he
would
only
allow
it
to
the
residential
consumers.
and
that
is
because
in
the
commercial
and
industrial
area
there
is
a
significant
number
of
users
that
have
the
ability
to
switch
to
alternative
fuels,
that
have
the
capacity
by
flicking
a
switch
to
go
from
oil
to
gas,
let's
say,
or
from
electricity
to
gas.
and
that
ability
creates
the
interplay
of
supply
and
demand
which
does
not
exist
at
the
residential
level,
and
which
was
the
reason
why
judge
posner
said
i
would
not
allow
it
for--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--i
see
no
reason
to
distinguish,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
i
see
no
reason
to
distinguish.
in
that
instance
it
is
easy
to
demonstrate
that
the
utility
did
not
absorb
the
overcharge.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
that's
right.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
there
is
no
way
that
they
can
recover
for
that
sweater,
right.
but
the
cost
of
new
insulation,
the
cost
of
putting
in
storm
windows,
all
of
the
things
that
has
followed
this
tremendous
increase
in
the
price
of
fuel,
there
is
no
way
to
recover
for
those.
all
we
are
talking
about
is
the
overcharge.
all
we
are
talking
about
is
can
we
trace
that
overcharge
and
know
exactly
where
it
went.
if
we
can,
and
we
can,
then
it
is
easy
to
demonstrate.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
until
we
have
a
lawsuit,
right.
but
that...
that
doesn't
change--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--no,
but
that
is
true
in
any
case,
your
honor.
that
is--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--in
this
particular
instance
it
is
the
attorneys
general
acting
parens
patriae
in
the
actions
that
they
have
brought.
we
have
to
prove
what
the
allegedly
illegal
price
was
at
the...
at
the
wellhead,
and
we
have
to
prove
what
the
but-for
price
would
be
if
they
had
been
competing.
but
that
remains
unchanged.
whether...
that
problem
of
proof
exists
whether
utilicorp
has
to
do
it
or
whether
the
state
has
to
do
it.
the
amount
of
the
overcharge
in
every
instance,
in
every
instance,
is
going
to
be
one
that
is
litigated
and
proved,
unless
somebody
comes
in
and
says
we
overcharged
them
x...
x
amount
of
money.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
as
long
as
it's
easy
to
demonstrate,
your
honor,
it's
easy
to
demonstrate
that
that
overcharge
did
not
rest
with
the
first
purchaser.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
the
federal...
the
purchased-gas
adjustment
mechanisms
which
are
in
force
on
the
federal
and
state
level
require
this
pass-on.
and
they
are
mandatory.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
rates.
it's...
it's
an
immediate...
i
am
glad
that
you've
mentioned
this,
your
honor,
because
it
is
entirely
different
from
rates.
every
time
the
cost
of
natural
gas
goes
up
by
one-tenth
of
one
cent
per
mcf,
that
is
one
mil--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--the
purchased-gas
adjustment
mechanism
goes
into
effect.
the
utility
raises...
is...
the
pipeline
raises
its
price
to
the
local
utility.
the
local
utility
raises
its
price
to
the
burner
tip
users.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
we
have,
at
tab
3,
your
honor,
set
forth
the
purchased-gas
adjustment
mechanism.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
and
more
than
that,
it
is
immediate
in
this
sense,
that
the
local
utility
district
reports
to
the
pipeline
each
month,
after
it
has
received
the
gas
and
delivered
it,
what
its
volumes
have
been
that
it
delivered
to
each
of
its
class
of
customers.
and
it
is
then,
and
only
then,
that
it
is
billed
for
that
gas
by
the
pipeline,
after
it
has
made
delivery.
so
it
is...
it
acts
immediately
that
the
local
utility
is
billed
and
it
bills...
it
bills
the
end-user.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
yes.
the
purchased-gas
adjustment
mechanism
works
both
ways,
your
honor.
any
increase
or
decrease
in
the
price
of
natural
gas,
in
the
level
of
one
mil
per
mcf
in
the
purchased-gas
adjustment
mechanism.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
yes,
your
honor.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal,
except
to
point
out
that
there
is
the
other
issue
that
was
raised
on
the
briefs,
with
regard
to
15
u.s.c.
section
4(c),
and
i
would
like
to
rely
on
what
was
said
in
the
briefs
in
connection
with
that.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
it
should
be
clear
that
the
fact-specific
arguments
that
utilicorp
has
made
are
not
before
this
court.
this
action
is
here
based
upon
summary
judgment
motions
brought
by
utilicorp
which
were
decided
before
discovery
was
well
underway.
the
court
below
assumed
that
there
was
a
perfect
and
provable
100
percent
pass-on,
and
that
is
the
facts
that
are
before
the
court
today.
justice
o'connor,
i
agree
that
you
can
look
at
the
utility
customer's
bill
and
determine
what
amount
they
had
been
charged
for
what
amount
of
gas.
fortunately,
in
the
parens
patriae
situation
that
is
not
necessary,
because
the
statute
clearly
provides
that
the
attorneys
general
may
aggregate
those
claims
to
make
them
easily
provable
so
that
individual
consumers
do
not
have
to
come
in
and
prove
that.
that
procedural
device
was
specifically
spelled
out.
when
the
government
says
that
clearly
the
court
was
relying
upon
a
rule
without
deviation
that
the
direct
purchaser
recover,
it
ignores
hanover
shoe,
it
ignores
illinois
brick,
it
ignores
the
discussions
that
this
court
has
had
with
regard
to
this
rule
since
then.
note
12
in
illinois
brick,
referring
to
the
pass-on
defense
which
the
court
recognized
in
hanover
shoe,
said
that
they
recognize
that
because
the
preexisting
cost-plus
contract
makes
the
normally
complicated
task
of
demonstrating
that
the
overcharge
had
not
been
absorbed...
excuse
me,
makes
easy
the
normally
complicated
task
of
demonstrating
that
the
overcharge
had
not
been
absorbed
by
the
direct
purchaser.
that
is
the
law
of
illinois
brick.
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about
here.
this
particular
situation
is
one
that
the
court
has
always
recognized,
that
the...
would
exist.
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
the
4(c)
question
is
here,
your
honor,
we
have
to
admit
that
it
was
not
argued
below.
but
i
think
that
justice
stevens
has...
has
put
his
finger
on
it,
that
the...
that
the
complaints
were
brought
pursuant
to
4(c).
only
4(c)
permits--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--the
answer
to
4(c)...
under
illinois
brick,
i
don't
believe
the
court
specifically
addressed
that,
your
honor.
under
illinois
brick
what
the
court
said
is
that
you
can--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--i
think
if
one
looks
at
the
legislative
history
with
regard
to
the
bills
that
were
passed,
that
it
was
clearly
the
intent
of
congress
that
4(c)
allow
the
attorneys
general
to
proceed
parens
patriae
on
behalf
of
consumers,
indirect
as
well
as
direct.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
clear
intent
of
4(c)
is
demonstrated
by
the
legislative
history
that
is
set
forth,
particularly
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus,
the
national
council
of...
or
national
league
of
state
legislatures,
demonstrates
that
congress
intended
that
4(c)
provided
a
separate
cause
of
action
for
the
attorneys
general
to
proceed
on
behalf
of
consumers--
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
--to
recover
damages
under
the
antitrust
laws,
both
indirect
and
direct.
mr.
thomas
j.
greenan
it
does
not
say
that
in
so
many
terms,
no,
your
honor.
we
have
to
look
to
the
legislative
history.
i
think
that
the
cases
of
this
court
clearly
demonstrate
that
the
united
states
is
in
error
when
it
says
that
the
court
has
always
assumed
only
the
direct
purchaser.
in
the
very
next
term
after
hanover
shoe,
this
court
examined
a
question
in
perkins
v.
standard
oil
and
followed
a
claim
down
through
several
levels
in
a
chain
of
distribution
to
allow
perkins
to
have
standing
to
proceed
with
that
claim
in
that
action.
here,
as
the
court
recently
said
in
the
arc
america
case,
if
it
is
easy
to
prove
the
extent
to
which
the
overcharge
has
been
passed
on
to
the
indirect
purchaser,
then
this
court...
the
phrasing
in
that
was
might
allow
an
exception.
we
believe
that
this
court
should
recognize
that
this
exception
is
within
the
language
set
forth
in
illinois
brick,
and
that
an
affirmance
of
illinois
brick
would
require--
