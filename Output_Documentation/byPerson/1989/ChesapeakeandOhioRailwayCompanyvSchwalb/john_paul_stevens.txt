justice

--the
issue
is
whether
he's
an
employee
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
isn't
it?
the
status
test
is
whether
he's
an
employee.
justice

paul
stevens
but
the
difference,
i
suppose,
is
they
were
engaged
in
work
that
one
could
say
was
part
of
the
loading
or
unloading
operation,
as
opposed
to
people
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
loading
operation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i...
i'm
not
suggesting
it's
necessarily
right,
but
one
could...
could
draw
a
distinction
between
that
kind
of
work
and
merely
repairing
or
maintaining
equipment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
that.
you...
you're
absolutely
right.
