thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
cases
require
only
that
this
court
confirm
the
integral
part
standard
it
has
already
establish
and
confirm
that
the
standard
applies
to
cover
the
employees
here.
the
standard
is
dictated
both
by
the
language
and
by
the
objectives
of
the
longshore
act.
the
department
of
labor
has
consistently
adopted
this
interpretation
of
the
act.
the
courts
of
appeals
have
uniformly
applied
the
same
test.
the
result
has
been
reliable
compensation
for
all
injuries,
no
matter
their
size,
received
by
workers
loading
cargo
on
the
waterfront.
i
would
like
to
review
how
both
the
language
and
the
objectives
of
the
longshore
act
direct
an
integral
part
standard,
but
first,
to
clarify.
the
integral
part
standard
is
a
broad
standard
based
on
the
types
of
work
that
congress
specified
to
be
covered
by
the
longshore
act.
it
is
capable
of
disposing
of
the
majority
of
status-based
disputes
that
come
up
under
the
act.
under
it,
a
worker
is
covered
if
his
work
is
necessary
to
keep
a
loading
operation
going.
justice
o'connor,
you
asked
about
what
principles
would
limit
the
application
of
the
test.
foremost,
the
test...
a
worker
must
be
doing
that
is
essential
to
the
mechanics
of
loading.
so,
if
there
is
a
chef
in
a
cafeteria
on
a
situs,
the
chef
would
not
be
covered
under
this
act.
that
might
be
convenient
for
the
workers,
but
it's
not
necessary.
secondly,
just
in
a
pragmatic
sense,
the
1984
amendments
act
as
an
outer
boundary.
it
is
clear...
the
courts
have
a
clear
signal
that
workers
on
those
categories
are
too
tenuously
related
to
the
work
of
loading
to
be
covered
by
the
act.
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
though,
the...
the
function
of
the
status
provision
is
to
select
for
a
type
of
work,
and
some
types
of
work...
the
logic
of
the
status
provision
includes
workers
who
are
outside
the
geographical
location
of
the
situs
test.
so
that
someone
who
is
mining
steel,
or
mining
metal
that
will
be
used
in
the
ship-loading
equipment,
would
be
covered
by
the
logic
of
the
test,
but
the
fact
is
that
that
person
is
never
going
to
be
on
the
situs.
that
is,
the
situs
and
the
status
test
work
in
tandem
to
select
sort
of
the
intersection
of
two
groups
of
workers
who
are
covered
by
the
act.
and...
finally,
i
would...
i
would
say
that
the
status
provision
does
select
most
workers
on
the
waterfront,
and
that
is
the
point
of
the
longshore
act,
is
to
cover
those
workers.
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
it
would
depend
on
how
often
the
worker
was
on
the
situs.
if
a
worker
is
regularly
sent
there
once
a
week
or
once
a
month,
that
worker
would
be
covered
by
the
longshore
act,
if
he
then
goes
and
does
work
on
the
situs
that
is
essential
for
the
loading
process.
i
think
that
we
wouldn't
push
a
position
that
someone
who
is,
fortuitously,
once
a
year
or
once
every
five
years,
on
the
situs,
would
be
covered.
but
if
it's
a
regular
assignment,
so
that
they
regularly
do
go
to
the
situs,
they
would
be
covered.
the
language
of
the
status
provision
indicates
in
two
ways
that
it
was
meant
to
cut
broadly
and
functionally.
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
the
language
of
the
situs
provision
is
at
903(a)
and
it
acts
to
cover
all
workers
who
are
injured
on
navigable
waters
and
then--
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
--i'm
sorry,
which?
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
no.
you
would
have
to
be
injured
on
the
situs
and
you
would
have
to
be
performing
a...
a
job
that
was
integral
to
the
loading.
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
what
i
meant...
the
case
that
i
thought
you
were
posing
was,
somebody
who
repairs
the
trunnion
rollers
in
downtown
norfolk
or
somewhere
else,
or
who
mines
the
metal,
if
that
person
fortuitously
comes
onto
a
situs
provision
and
to
the
situs--
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
--they
would
not
be
covered.
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
but
it...
it's
the
work...
the
work
has
to
be
going
on,
on
the
situs.
the
worker
must
be
doing
work
that's
essential
to
the
loading
process
on
the
situs.
i
think
the
language
of
the
status
provision
supports
this.
did
i...
did
i
make
myself
clear?
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
if...
if
the
delivery...
i
think
that
that
worker
would
qualify
in
the
sense
that
he
was
delivering...
his
delivery
was
a
regular
job
on
the
situs,
he
would
qualify.
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
that's
right.
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
my
understanding
of
the...
of
the
situs
provision
is
that
it...
it
would
select
for
employees
who
were
working
who
met
the
status
provision.
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
well,
that's
right.
i
mean,
he
has
to
work
for
an
employer
who
is...
who--
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
--yes,
that's
right.
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
i
think
that--
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
--well,
i...
i'm
willing
to
accept
that
case.
i'm
willing
to
accept
that
case.
i...
i
wasn't--
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
--i
would
accept
that...
that
position.
i
think
that
it...
it's
not
a
situation
that's
likely
to
occur
very
often,
and
the
great
majority
of
people
are
going
to
be
on
the
situs.
if
i
could
move
to
the
language
of
the
provision,
congress
specified
that
longshoring
was
covered,
but
it
didn't
stop
there.
it
added
that
those
engaged
in
longshoring
operations
were
also
covered.
if
longshoremen
load
and
they're
covered
by
the
word
longshoremen,
"then
there
would
be
no
point
to
the
phrase,
longshoring
operations.
"
that
phrase
must
refer
to
a
larger
group,
and
i
would
suggest
the
natural
reading
is
maintenance
and
repair
people.
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
i
would.
ms.
christine
a.
desan-husson
well,
i
think
there
are
a
number
of...
of
categories
that
it
would
be
hard
to
specify
in
the
act.
the
second
feature
of
the
language
that
i
think
is
worth
noting
is
that
congress
defined
coverage
by
establish...
establishing
as
a
universe
of
workers
that
were
covered
all
those
that
were
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
that
is,
it
used
a
term
which,
as
the
court
made
clear
in
perini,
had
been
given
a
broad
meaning
before
1972.
then,
making
explicit
that
the
list
was
not
exhaustive,
it
specified
the
named
categories
of
workers
who
were
engaged
in
maritime
employment...
that
is,
longshorers,
et
cetera.
it
then
repeated
the
functions
of
those
workers
in
the
situs
provision.
attention
to
the
objectives
of
the
statute
makes
it
even
clearer
that
congress
wrote
broadly
and
functionally
when
it
wrote
the
status
provision.
it
wrote
functionally
because
it
was
responding...
it
was
reforming
a
system
in
which
injury
had
depended
only
on
the
location...
in
which
recovery
had
depended
only
on
the
location
of
an
injury.
it
wrote
broadly
because
it
did
not
want
the
new
line
to
become
as
arbitrary
as
the
old
line.
it
needed
a
flexible
line
to
make
account...
make
allowance
for
new
technology.
in
this
case,
the
loading
operation
is
almost
wholly
automated,
so
that
if
technology
reduces
manual
functions,
a
line
that
would...
would
cover
longshorers
would
have
to
cover
those
who
are
doing
maintenance
and
repair,
if
it
wasn't
to
be
quite
arbitrary
and
only
cover
the
people
who
flipped
the
switch
as
opposed
to
the
people
who
repaired
the
switch.
second,
congress
wanted
a
simple,
rational
standard
that
would
cover
all
who
were
on
the
waterfront.
it
therefore
declined
to
import
distinctions
like
the
point
of
rest
that
the
court
rejected
in
pfeiffer
and
in
northeast
marine
terminal.
a
rational
coverage
of
all
those
engaged
in
longshoring
operations
would
cover
those
who
were
working
with
the
same
equipment
and
were
exposed
to
the
same
hazards,
and
those
who
should...
should
merit
the
same
compensation
whether
they
are
repairing
the
equipment
or
operating
it.
