justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
was
all
they
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
else
did
they
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
but
did
they
have
any
other
duties,
other
than...
other
than
this
integral
part
of
the
loading
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
injury
was...
all
of
them
were
in
the
process
of
performing
their
loading
duties?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
this
is...
it
would
not
satisfy
the
situs
requirement.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
that's
just
on
the
situs
at
the
time
of
the
injury,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
this
man
that
justice
scalia
talks
about
worked
downtown
364
days
out
of
the
year
but
came
down
on
november
1st
and
had
an
accident,
he'd
be
covered?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
your
position
though,
is
it
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well...
what
is
episodic,
once
a
week?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
once
a
month?
justice
byron
r.
white
that...
that
is
your
position?
if
he
spends...
spends
two
and
a
half
percent
of
his
time
on
the
situs,
he's
covered?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
your
approach,
then,
would
any
of
the
railroad's
employees
engaged
in
this
operation
be
covered
by
the
longshoreman's
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
any
others
that
were
moving
this
coal
from
the
car
to
the
ship.
were
any
of
them?
would
any
of
them
be
covered?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
just
turn
on
who
employed
them,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
saying
none
of
the
railroad
employees
moving
this
coal
to
the
ship
would
be
covered
by
the
longshoreman's
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
one
that
would
be
covered.
justice
byron
r.
white
wasn't
this
movement
from...
from
the
railroad
car
to
the
ship
continuous,
when
the
conveyer
belt
ran
from
the
car
to
the
ship?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
stop
anywhere.
it
just
went.
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
sort
of
like
that
chute
that
you
just
mentioned.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
then...
suppose
the
railroad
said
we
don't
want
to
do
this
with
our
own
employees.
we're
going
to
hire
a
longshoreman
to
move
this
coal.
we'll
deliver
the
cars
to
the
site
and
the
longshoremen
run
the
conveyer,
furnish
the
conveyer
belt,
run
it
under
the
ship.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
they...
would
they
be
covered
under
the
longshoremen's
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
i've
just
told
you
what
it
was.
they
arrive
at...
the
cars
arrive
at
the
yard,
on
the
railroad,
at
the
siding,
and
the
longshoremen
move
this...
stevedoring
outfit
just
moves
the
coal
onto
the
ship,
by
the
same
conveyer
belts.
would
they
be
covered?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
if
you
have
doubts
about
that,
why,
i
don't
know
why
you
don't
have
the
same
doubts
about
the
railroad
employees.
i
just
say
the
railroad
company
hires
a
stevedoring
company
to
move
this
coal
from
ship...
from
car
to
ship,
just
exactly
the
way
it
was
being
moved
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
first
opinion
is
issued
in
two
companion
cases,
chesapeake
and
ohio
railway
company
against
schwalb,
and
northfork
and
western
railway
company
against
goode.
the
judgments
of
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
in
these
cases
are
reversed
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk.
justice
blackmun
while
joining
the
opinion
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
he
is
joined
by
justices
marshall
and
oâ€™connor.
justice
stevens
concurs
in
the
judgment
and
has
filed
an
opinion
to
that
effect.
