mr.
prince,
the
limits
of
this
so-called
functional
relationship
test
that
you
propose
aren't
entirely
clear.
in
a
sense,
all
employees
at
the
maritime
situs
might
be
said
to
contribute
to
the
loading
process.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
has...
the
test
you
propose
has
the
disadvantage
of
forcing
the
courts,
in
a
case-by-case
basis,
to
determine
how
essential
and
how
integral
the
work
is
to
the
loading
process.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
problem
of
the
occasional
visit
to
the
situs
and
the
injury
occurring
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
it
has
to
do
with
whether
he's
a
maritime
employee?
that's
right.
and
then--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wilcox,
do
you
recognize
that
most
of
the
federal
courts
considering
these
questions
have
adopted
the
test
that
the
solicitor
general's
office
suggests,
rather
than
the
one
adopted
by
the
supreme
court
of
virginia?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
perini
had
language
in
it
rejecting
the
test
adopted
by
the
virginia
supreme
court,
didn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wilcox,
do
you
think
we
owe
any
deference
to
the
interpretation
of
the
act
by
the
department
of
labor
that's
charged
with
administering
it?
