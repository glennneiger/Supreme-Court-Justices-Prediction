mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
we
appear
before
you
this
afternoon
on
behalf
of
nancy
schwalb,
william
mcglone
and
robert
goode,
three
railroad
workers
who
were
injured
while
they
were
on
the
job.
we
do
not
agree
that
these
workers
were
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
these
three
railroad
employees
are
covered
for
their
work-related
injuries
by
the
federal
employers'
liability
act,
which
was
passed
in
1908
to
benefit
railroad
workers,
or
by
the
longshore
and
harborworkers'
compensation
act,
which
was
originally
enacted
in
1927
to
provide
benefits
for
longshore
and
harborworkers
not
covered
by
state
workers'
compensation
statutes.
we
suggest
that
a
review
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
longshore
act
and
the
amendments
to
that
act
in
1972,
together
with
a
review
of
this
court's
decisions
since
the
enactment
of
the
1972
amendments
to
the
longshore
act,
will
cause
you
to
decide
that
these
railroad
workers
should
be
treated
as
railroad
workers
and
not
as
longshore
and
harborworkers.
your
decision
here
today
will
not
affect
longshore
and
harborworkers.
it
will
only
apply
to
a
limited
number
of
railroad
workers.
nancy...
nancy
schwalb
and
william
mcglone
held
jobs
as
laborers
at
the
chesapeake
&
ohio
railway
company.
they
performed
housekeeping
and
janitorial
services
in
offices,
in
shops,
in
bathrooms,
locker
rooms
and
at
other
places
situated
on
the
railroad's
pier
and
adjacent
property
in
newport
news,
virginia.
schwalb
was
hurt
in
a
fall
as
she
was
walking
along
a
catwalk.
william
mcglone
was
hurt
while
clearing
away
coal
beneath
a
conveyor
belt.
robert
goode
is
employed
by
the
norfolk
&
western
railway
company
as
a
machinist.
a
machinist
is
railroad
language
for
a
mechanic.
he
repairs
railroad
equipment.
on
the
day
he
was
hurt,
he
was
assigned
to
inspect
and
repair
if
necessary
a
retarder
on
the
southside
dumper
at
the
lambert
point
yard.
as
mentioned
earlier,
a
retarder
is
a
breaking
system
that
stops
railroad
cars.
retarders
are
common
and
located
throughout
the
railroad
system.
the
retarder
is
attached
to
a
larger
piece
of
railroad
equipment
called
a
dumper.
railroad
cars
are
moved
onto
the
dumper,
held
in
place
by
the
retarders,
which
are
the
breaking
system,
and
then
they
are
rotated
to
unload
the
railroad
cars
by
turning
them
upside
down.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
not
those
that
were
engaged
in
these
functions
here.
now,
they
conceivably
could
be--
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
--your
honor,
it
depends
on
where
you
draw
the
line.
we
would
suggest
that
these
railroad
employees
were,
and
especially
bobby
goode,
was
involved
in
unloading
a
railroad
car,
which
is...
he
could
be
doing
that
at
any
location...
or,
he
was
repairing
a
piece
of
equipment
that
unloads
a
railroad
car,
and
he
could
be
doing
that
at
any
location
throughout
the
railroad
system
where
they
have
retarders.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
well,
he
unloaded
it
onto
a
system
of
conveyer
belts,
which
we
would
suggest,
and
we
argued
in
our
brief,
that
those
conveyer
belts,
once
the
coal
is
unloaded
onto
the
belt,
they
could
take
the
coal
to
a
power
plant
or
a
steel
mill
or
any
other
type
of
facility
that
uses
a
lot
of
coal.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
eventually
it
got
to
a
ship.
yes,
sir,
it
did.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
it
had
to
go
through
a
system,
sir,
where
it...
the
direction
of
the
coal
actually
changed,
and
up
until
that
time
it's
our
position
that
he
could
have
been
involved
in
just
merely
unloading
a
railroad
car.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
again,
it
depends
on
where
the
conveyer
belt
is
located
and
where
the--
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
--it
goes
to
the
question
of
what
is
the
situs,
what
is
the
location
here,
which
is
part
of
the
statute.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
i
would
have
to
maintain
the
same
thing.
it
could
be
going
somewhere
else,
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
well,
originally,
that's
what
the
act
said.
you
had
to
be
out
over
the
water.
then
it
was
amended
to
include
other
harbor
and
longshore
workers
that
were
on
the
landward
side
by
the
amendments
in
1972.
but
you
do
have
to
focus
on
what
these
workers
were
doing
at
the
time
they
were
injured,
and
what
their
occupation
is.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
if
it
did,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
they'd
be
covered
by
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
no,
sir.
once...
once
it
gets
into
the
actual
loading
process--
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
--well,
if
for
example...
and
i
know
there's
a...
there's
a
federal
case
law,
the
harmon
case.
he
was
a
railroad
employee
who
was
working
in
a
funnel
system
that
actually
down-loaded
the
cargo
right
into
the
hold
of
the
ship.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
it
did
in
the
sense
that
it
went--
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
--that's
right,
but
it--
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
--well,
if
you
follow
that,
if
it...
the
railroad
then
could
make
the
same
argument,
your
honor.
if
it
took
the...
from
the
point
a
railroad
car
was
loaded
at
the
wine...
mines
in
west
virginia
and
went
all
the
way,
without
interruption,
and
without
stopping,
and
was
then
loaded
onto
a
ship,
the
same
argument
would
apply.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
your
honor,
my
understanding
is
that,
in
fact,
is
what's
happened.
most
of
this
has
been
contracted
out,
in
that
area.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
again,
you
have
to
focus
on
what
they're
doing.
what
is
their
job?
and
i
+/?
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
--they
would
be
covered
from
the
point
that
it's
actually
being
loaded
onto
the
ships.
i
guess
my
distinction
is...
is
not
as
clear
as
it
could
be,
and
it
points
out
the
problems
of
the...
where
the
coverage
starts
and
stops.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
i
understand
your
question,
your
honor,
and
it
depends...
for
example,
in
robert
goode's
case
you
would
have
to
examine
what
those
individuals
were
working
on
at
the
time.
if
they
are
"longshoremen",
that
would
be
because
they
maybe
belong
to
a
longshore
union
or
something,
but
they
may
be
required
to
work
on
railroading
equipment,
and
that's
the
problem
we
have
here
today.
the...
the...
in
goode's
case,
he
was
working
on
railroading
equipment.
now,
it's
a
matter
of
definition.
was
he
working
on
a
piece
of
equipment
that
is
involved
in
the
essential
elements
of
loading
a
ship,
or
is
he
involved
in
working
on
a
piece
of
equipment
that
is...
in...
part
of
the
essential
elements
of
unloading
a
railroad
car?
it
does
become
a
question
of
definition,
and
you
have
to
look
and
see
what...
what
his
actual
occupation
was.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
that's
true
to
some
extent,
but
i
believe
that
if
the
court
reviews
the
cases...
for
example,
in
the
dravo
case,
which
is
a
3rd
circuit
case,
it's
very
similar
to
the
situation
for
mcglone
and
schwalb.
that
involved
a...
a
laborer,
a
person
who
was
involved
in
clean-up
activities
similar
to
what
schwalb
and
mcglone
were
doing,
and
in
that
case,
3rd
circuit,
they
have...
they
have
indicated
that
the
longshore
harborworkers
compensation
act
does
not
apply.
they
haven't
extended
it.
it's
not
uniform
as
to
where
all
the
circuits
stand
on
this
case.
the
virginia
supreme
court
in
the
white
decision
relied
on
the
weyerhauser
case,
which
was
a
9th
circuit
case,
which
has
not
been
overruled,
and
that,
again,
limits
the
expansion
of
the
longshore
coverage.
if
we
have
to
examine
the
legislative
intent
of
the
congress
when
the
act
was
amended
in
1972.
this
court
has
reviewed
that
intent,
both
in
the
caputo
decision
and
later
in
the
perini
decision,
which
was
director
v....
office
of
workers
compensation
v.
perini.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
it
may
have,
but
it
did
review
the
purposes
of
expansion,
or
the
amendments,
and
as
your
honor
well
recalls,
having
written
the
opinion,
the
purposes
were
to
expand
coverage,
to
extend
it
to
longshoring
workers
and
it
recognized
the
changing
nature
of
the
industry.
because
of
containerization
a
lot
of
the
work
had
moved
from
the
ship
and
onto
the
land,
and
there...
but
there
were
three
main
groups
that
were
interested
in
amending
that
longshore
act,
and
this
was
indicated
first
in
the
caputo
decision
and
then
later
reexamined
in
the
perini
case.
they
involved
three
groups.
the
first
of
the
groups
were
the
ship
owners,
who
did
not
want
to
be
sued
on
a
seaworthiness
doctrine
by
the
longshore
workers.
the
second
were
the
employers
of
the
longshore
workers,
who
had...
under
a
judicially
created
doctrine
had
to
indemnify
the
ship
owners,
and
the
third
group
were
the
workers
themselves,
who
wanted
to
have
an
improvement
in
their
benefits.
and
the
problem
here
was
the
benefits
under
the
federal
statute
were
ordinarily
superior
to
the
benefits
under
the
state
workers'
compensation
statutes,
and
one
of
the
purposes
for
amending
the
act
and
expanding
the
coverage
was
to
permit
these
longshore
and
harborworkers
to
enjoy
improved
benefits
under
the
federal
statute.
now,
in
the
case
we
have
here,
we
think
it's
important
to
note
that
all
three
of
these
workers
are
railroad
workers.
none
of
them
filed
an
action
to
be
brought
within
the
coverage
of
the
longshore
and
harborworkers
compensation
act.
this
is...
in
all
the
other
cases
this
court
has
reviewed,
it
was
individuals
who
filed
for
their
claims
under
the
longshore
act--
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
--no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it's
optional.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
well,
because
if
the
purpose
for
amending
the
act
was
to
improve
their
benefits,
these
workers
here,
these
railroad
workers,
all...
already
have
a
perfectly
suitable
source
of
compensation
through
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
it's
not
optional.
i
mean,
they
have
a
method.
for
the
last
80
years,
they've
had
a
way
to
file
for
claims
when
they're
hurt
on
the
job,
and
that's
through
the
fela.
and
we
don't
suggest
that
it's
optional,
but
they
already
have
an
adequate
remedy
that's
provided
to
them
through
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
well,
as...
as
the
court's
well
aware
by
the
questions
here
this
afternoon,
the
question
of
coverage
and
who
it
applies
to
and
who
it
doesn't
apply
to
is...
provokes
lots
of
questions,
and
we
would
suggest
that
the
intent
of
the
congress
was
to
expand
the
coverage
to
benefit
workers.
and
it
was
never
intended
to
expand
it
to
apply
to
railroad
workers
because,
if
one
of
the
reasons
to
amend
the
act
was
to
improve
benefits,
that
certainly
isn't
the
case
here
today,
where
the
railroad--
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
--yes
sir,
i
did,
and
if
you
look
at
what
he's
actually
doing
at
the
time
he's
hurt,
he's
loading
a
ship,
and
that's...
fits
within
the
definition
of
the
status
test.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
yes
sir,
that's
correct,
and
the
court
here
this
afternoon
could
make
a
policy
decision
that
there's
already
an
act
sufficient
and
adequate
for
railroad
workers
and
rule
as...
draw
an
arbitrary
bright
line
as
to
who
the
act
applies
to
and
who
it
doesn't
apply
to.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir.
but
there
was
a
previous
decision
of
this
court
that
drew
such
a
bright
line,
and
that
was
in
southern
pacific
v.
jensen
way
back
in
1917.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
no,
i'm
not.
[laughter]
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
although
we
didn't...
sir,
we
didn't
mention
in
our
brief,
but
if
you
look
at
the
specific
language
in
the
act
in
33
u.s.c.a.
section
902(3),
which
contains
what
an
employee's--
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
--i'm...
from
the
joint
appendix
on
page
47.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
47,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
it
just...
it
occurred
to
me,
we
didn't
mention
it
in
our
brief,
but
there
are
specific
exclusions
from
the
coverage
and
in
section
902(3)(d),
individuals
who
are
one,
employed...
are
employed
by
suppliers,
transporters
or
vendors...
now,
is
a
railroad
a
transporter?
they
may
be
specifically
excluded
by
the
language
of
the
act.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
there...
there's
a
further
requirement
that
they
have
to
be
subject
to
the
coverage
of
some
state
workers'
compensation
law.
but
the
point
is
that
the...
if
the
intention
of
congress
was
to
provide
benefits
or
to
exclude
others
where
it
would
improve
their
benefits
when
they
amended
the
act,
it
certainly
doesn't
accomplish
that
purpose
here,
today.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir?
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
yes,
sir.
it
does
have
language
that
says--
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
--no,
they
cannot.
the
longshore
act
contains
language
that
it
is
the
exclusive
remedy
if
they
are
covered
by
the
act.
we
just
simply
argue
that
they're
not
covered
by
the
act.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
well,
certainly
we
ask
the
court
to
consider
what
they've
put
forward
here
this
afternoon,
but
we
essentially
argue
that
they're
wrong,
that
there
was
never
an
intention
to
cover
these
types
of
employees,
and
if
one
of
the
goals
is
to
clarify
where
coverage
starts
and
where
coverage
ends,
it's...
with
the
language
of
the
statute
as
we
have
it,
it's
not
going
to...
it's
always
going
to
be
taken
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
you
can't...
you
don't
fall
within
it
necessarily
or
not.
you
have
to
examine
what
the
individual
worker
was
doing
when
they
got
hurt.
in
the
pfeiffer
case,
decided
in
1969,
the
court
here
again
reviewed
the
legislative
history
of
this
area
of
the
law
and
noted
that
the
seven...
the
1972
amendments
to
the
longshore
act
added
a
second
test.
well,
that's
the
status
test.
in
that
opinion,
it
was
noted
that
an
earlier
decision,
the
caputo
decision,
had
specifically
rejected
a
point
of
rest
theory.
we
suggest
that
what
the
railroad
is
arguing
here
today
is
asking
the
court
to
readopt
a
point
of
rest
theory.
the
point
of
rest
theory
was
based
on
cargo
being
off-loaded
from
a
ship.
it
came
to
rest
at
some
point
where
it
was
no
longer
moving
on
the
shore,
and
that
was
where
the
longshoring
activity
stopped
and
some
other
activity
began.
in
the
caputo
decision,
that
theory
was
specifically
rejected.
we
suggest
that
the
railroad
here
today
is
asking
the
court
to
readopt
a
similar
type
of
theory,
only
in
the
converse.
that
is,
the
coal
is
mined
in
the
mountains
and
is
brought
by
the
railroad
car
down...
cars
down
to
the
railroad
yard
in
norfolk,
where
the
railroad
cars
stop,
and
then
at
some
point
the
cars
are
then
assembled
for
moving
onto
the
ships.
now,
we
would
suggest
that
that...
if
that
is
where
the
longshoring
activity
starts,
that
would
be
readopting
a
theory
that
has
been
specifically
been
rejected
here.
again,
you
have
to
focus
on
what
these
employees
were
doing
at
the
time
and
what
their
jobs
were...
at
the
time
they
were
hurt,
and
what
their
jobs
were.
they
were
railroad
employees.
they
did
not
handle
cargo.
they
did
not
unload
ships.
they
did
not
load
ships.
in
fact,
for
schwalb
and
mcglone,
they
were
specifically
prohibited
from
handling
the
cargo
and
placing
it
back
on
the
conveyer
belts.
it's
also
the...
in
mr.
mcglone's
case,
it's
particular...
particularly
important
because
he
was
injured
in
a
place
where...
the
same
place
where
he
was
injured
in
this
case
a
year
before.
he
suffered
an
injury
on
the
job,
working
as
a
laborer
in
the
same
location,
and
the
railroad
adjusted
that
case
under
the
fela.
he
made
a
claim
under
the
fela
and
it
was
settled.
it's
part
of
the
record
here.
a
year
later,
in
1983,
he
suffered
another
injury
doing
the
same
job
in
the
same
location,
working
the
same
area,
with
the
same
duties,
and
now
the
railroad
denies
his
fela
claim
and
asserts
that
he's
not
covered
by
that,
and
we
would
suggest
that
nothing
has
changed.
what
has
changed?
the
act
was
amended
in
1972.
the...
this
court
decided
the
caputo
case
in
1977,
the
four...
pfeiffer
case
in
1979,
and
here,
mcglone
gets
hurt
in
1982
and
his
case
is
settled
under
fela.
a
year
later,
he
gets
hurt
doing
the
same
sort
of
thing
and
the
claim
is
denied,
based
on
jurisdictional
coverage.
the
only
difference,
the
only
distinction
of
these
two
situations
is,
in
the
second
case
he
suffered
a
very
serious
injury
and
his
arm
has
been
permanently
disabled
and
disfigured.
he's
permanently
disabled
from
returning
the
railroad
work,
and
the
only
difference
is
the
severity
of
his
injury.
now,
we
suggest
that
what
the
railroad
has
done
is
made
an
administrative
decision
that
it's
cheaper
to
handle
the
case,
or
adjust
the
case,
through
the
longshore
act,
rather
than
through
the
fela.
and,
of
course,
this
would
be
a
way
of
handling
the
case
we
again
would
state
the
congress
never
intended
the...
to
apply
to
these
type
of
workers.
we
would
further
assert
that
if
what
the
goal
of
the
railroad
would
be
would
be
to
have
a
long...
a
worker's
compensation
act
for
railroad
employees--
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
--yes,
sir,
i
did.
mr.
bruce
a.
wilcox
well,
your
honor,
would...
the...
and...
i...
the
point
is
that
it's
an
expansion
of
a
workers
comp
statute,
and
traditionally
there
has
been
never
a
workers
comp
statute
for
railroad
workers
and
if
that's
what's
sought
here,
we
suggest
that
should
be
handled
legislatively
rather
than
expanded
judicially.
we
urge
that
the
court
remember
what
job
goode
was
performing
when
he
was
hurt.
he
was
the
mechanic.
he
was
repairing
the
railroad
equipment.
he
was
repairing
a
retarder,
which
is
part
of
the
braking
system.
he
was
not
loading
a
ship;
he
was
not
unloading
a
ship.
he
was
working
on
a
piece
of
railroad
equipment.
this
issue
of
what
constitutes
maritime
employment
was
most
recently
before
this
court
in
herb's
welding
v.
gray
in
1985.
gray
was
a
welder
who
worked
on
an
off-shore
drilling
platform
off
the
louisiana
coast.
when
he
was
hurt
doing
a
welding
job,
be
filed
a
claim
for
benefits
under
the
longshore
act.
this
court
held
that
he
was
not
entitled
to
benefits
because
he
was
not
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
the
opinion
reviewed
both
the
situs
and
the
status
requirements
for
coverage
under
the
act
and
concluded
that
congress'
purpose
when
the
longshore
act
was
amended
was
to
cover
those
workers
on
a
covered
situs
who
were
involved
in
the
essential
elements
of
the
loading
or
unloading
or
construction
of
vessels.
the
court
held
that
gray...
gray's
welding
was
far
removed
from
such
traditional
longshoring
activities
and
it
was,
therefore,
not
covered.
reviewing
the
expansion
of
the
definition
of
the
situs
test
and
the
addition
in
the
amended
act
of
the
status
test,
the
court
recognized
the
intended
limitations
of
coverage,
and
it
stated,
"congress
did
not
seek
to
cover
all
those
who
breathe
salt
air.
"
there
is
a
limit
to
the
coverage.
the
pfeiffer
case
stated
that
the
maritime
employment
requirement
is
an
occupational
test
that
focuses
on
loading
and
unloading.
the
amendments
were
not
meant
to
cover
employees
not
engaged
in
loading,
unloading,
repairing
or
building
a
vessel,
just
because
they
are
injured
in
an
area
adjoining
navigable
waters
used
for
such
activity.
we
urge
the
court
here
to
follow
these
precedents.
none
of
these
railroad
workers
were
engaged
in
essential
elements
of
loading
or
unloading
a
vessel.
none
of
them
handled
the
cargo.
they
were
performing
traditional
railroad
functions
and
were
not
engaged
in
maritime
employment.
thank
you.
