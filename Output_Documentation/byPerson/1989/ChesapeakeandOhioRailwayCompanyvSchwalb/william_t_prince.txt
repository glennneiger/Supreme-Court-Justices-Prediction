mr.
william
t.
prince
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
workers
who
maintain
and
repair
ship-loading
equipment
at
a
waterfront
situs
are
engaged
in
longshoring
operations
and
therefore
are
covered
by
the
longshore
and
harborworkers'
compensation
act.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
says
they're
not.
the...
when
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
was
first
faced
with
the
identical
issue,
there
were
very
few
federal
reported
cases
that
gave
any
guidance
at
all,
and
that
was
in
1977
and
the
case
was
ralph
white
against
the
norfolk
&
western
railway
company.
in
this
case,
the
three
cases
that
are
now
before
the
court,
the
three
employees,
like
ralph
white,
were
engaged
in
the
maintenance
and
repair
of
longshore
equipment.
each
brought
a...
a
claim
against
the
railway
company
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act
claiming
damages
caused
by
employer
negligence.
in
each
of
the
cases,
the
railway
company
gained
dismissal
on
the
ground
that
the
employees
were
engaged
in
longshoring
operations
and
that
their
exclusive
remedy
was
under
the
longshore
act.
that
was
the
exact
situation
that
prevailed
in
1977
in
the
ralph
white
case,
and
if
i
may,
the
ralph
white
case
is
important
in
this
context.
ralph
white
was
an
electrician
who
worked
on
the
piers
in
norfolk
at
lambert's
point.
his
work
was
the
repair
and
the
maintenance
of...
of
the
apparatus...
excuse
me,
the
electrical
apparatus...
that
was
used
to
run
to
coal
loading
machinery
at
lambert's
point.
not
only
did
ralph
white
repair
the
machinery
that
kept
the
operation
going,
but
he
actually
went
on
board
ships
and,
on
some
occasions,
he
actually
worked
on
scaffolding
attached
to
the
piers
oh...
over
the
navigable
waters.
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
held
in
1977
that
ralph
white
was
not
engaged
in
longshoring
operations
because
he
did
not
manually
handle
cargo,
or
he
did
not
actually
operate
the
machinery
that
kept
the...
the
operation
going.
now,
that
was
in
1977.
by
mid-1980,
nearly
all
of
the
circuit
court
judges
in
virginia
who
had
the
same,
or
nearly
the
same
issue
come
before
them,
had
stopped
following
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
in
its
ralph
white
case
and
had
started
following
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
northeast
terminal
v.
caputo
and
pfeiffer
v.
ford,
and
especially
the
opinions
of
the
federal
circuit
courts
of
appeal,
especially
the
4th
circuit,
and
the
benefits
review
board
opinions
which
were
interpreting
this
court's
opinions
in
caputo
and
pfeiffer.
the
court
in
caputo
said
that
congress
intended
expanded
coverage,
and
in
pfeiffer
you
said
that
congress
intended
a
simple,
uniform
standard
of
coverage.
by
mid-1980,
the
federal
circuits
and
the
benefits
review
board
had
worked
out,
following
caputo
and
ford,
a...
essentially
consistent
interpretation
that
was
uniform
and
simple
in
factual
situations
like
this.
but
in
1988,
when
these
three
cases
reached
the
supreme
court
of
virginia,
the
court...
the
virginia
court...
rejected
the
reasoning
of
the
federal
courts
and
rejected
the
reasoning
of
the
many
decisions
of
the
benefits
review
board
and
specifically
reapplied
its
reasoning
in
the
ralph
white
case,
holding
that
these
three
employees
were,
in
effect,
janitors
and
were
not
involved
in
longshoring
operations.
let
me
tell
you
for
a
few
minutes
about
what
these
three
employees
did.
they
were...
two
were
employed
by
the
c&o
railway,
which
is
now
csx
transportation,
and
one
was
employed
by
norfolk
&
western.
nancy
schwalb
and
william
mcglone
worked
for
the
coal
loading
facility
at
c&o
at
newport
news,
and
they
were
engaged
in
cleaning
the
equipment
that
was
used
in
the
coal
loading
operation.
the
operation
at
both
facilities
is
the
picking
up
of
these
coal
cars,
turning
them
upside
down,
dumping
the
coal
into
the
hoppers,
from
which
they
get
onto
belts
and
go
onto
the
ship
loaders.
now,
the
two
employees
working
in
newport
news
had
the
job
of
cleaning
the...
what...
what
are
known
as
the
trunnion
rollers.
these...
these
are
rollers
upon
which
these
dumpers
move,
and
in
the
dumping
operation
coal
unavoidably
falls
and
collects
around
those
trunnion
rollers
and
if
that
coal
is
not
cleaned
away,
then
the
operation
will...
will
come
to
a
stop.
they
also
were
involved
in
cleaning
coal
that
had
come
off
the
belts
and
were...
was
accumulating
under
the
belts.
now
the
two
circuit
court
judges...
the
two
virginia
circuit
court
judges...
who
heard
the
jurisdictional
evidence
both
found
that
the
work
that
nancy
schwalb
and
william
mcglone
were
doing
was
essential
to
the
coal
loading
operation,
and
that
if
it
was
not
done,
that
operation
would
come
to
a
halt.
now,
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
in
its
decision
in
this
case
actually
accepts
that
finding
and
stated
in
its
opinion
that,
if
the
work
was
not
done,
the
dumpers
would
malfunction
and
the
conveyer
belts
would
become
damaged
and
the
work
would
be
interfered
with.
nevertheless,
the
supreme
court,
accepting
the
fact
that
this
work
was
essential
and
would
cause
the...
the
coal
loading
to
stop
if
it
were
not
done,
said
that
it
was
construing
this
court's
opinion
in
the
caputo
case
and
that
this
court
in
the
caputo
case
was
saying
that
if
an
employee
did
not
actually
handle
cargo,
then
he
was
not
engaged
in
maritime
employment
or
longshoring
operations.
mr.
william
t.
prince
thank
you.
your
honors,
i
was
saying
just
before
the
luncheon
recess
that
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
had
acknowledged
in
its
opinion
that
the
coal
loading
process
would
come
to
a
stop
if
the
work
was
not
done
that
schwalb
and
mcglone
were
doing.
and
then
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
said
that
it
was
construing
your
opinion
in
caputo
and
said
that
that
opinion
held
that
employees
who
were
not
actually
handling
cargo
were
not
involved
in
the
essential
elements
of
longshoring
operations
and,
therefore,
these
employers
were
not
covered
by
the
act.
it
is
also
noteworthy
that
in
the
caputo
case,
you
said
that
an
employee
who
was
not
involved
in
the
ongoing
process
of
loading
was
not
covered.
the
virginia
supreme
court
specifically
stated
that
it
would
not
adopt
an
ongoing
process
test.
the
third
employee,
the
one
whose
case--
mr.
william
t.
prince
--no,
your
honor.
actually,
i
think
the...
what
you
have
said
in
the
pfeiffer
and
ford
cases,
that
an
employee
who
is
involved
in
an
integral
part
of
the
loading
process
is
covered,
also,
the
term
has
been
used,
"essential
elements".
so
any
employee
who
plays
even
a
small
part
of
an
integral
part
is
covered,
and
these
employees
are
all
engaged
in
the
repair
and
maintenance
of
equipment
which
would
come
to
a
halt
if
not
done.
mr.
william
t.
prince
an
integral
part
of
the
loading
operation...
of
the
longshoring.
what
we
are
looking
at
is
longshoring
operations.
the
loading
of
coal
in
this
instance,
or
the
movement
of
cargo
from
land
transportation
to
ship.
mr.
william
t.
prince
even
if,
parttime,
they
swept
out
the
office.
you
have
said
that
in
your
earlier
cases,
that
if
an
employee
is
covered
for
some
part
of
his
work,
or
her
work,
then
that
employee
is
covered
for
all
of
their
work.
mr.
william
t.
prince
if
it
was
limited
to
cleaning
out
the
fallen
coal,
because
it
was
a...
it
was--
mr.
william
t.
prince
--that
would
be
enough,
because
it
was
a
factual
finding
that,
if
that
coal
was
not
cleaned
out
from
under
the
conveyer
belts,
the
conveyer
belts
would
be
damaged
and
would
interfere
with
the
loading
so
it
was
essential
to
get
that
coal
cleaned,
and
therefore,
those
employees
are
involved
in
the
longshoring
operations.
mr.
william
t.
prince
no,
that
was
not
all
they
did,
your
honor.
mr.
william
t.
prince
one
of
the
other
employees...
well,
they...
one
of
the
employees
at
the
time
of
injury...
and
of
course
the
time
of
injury
is
not
the
test,
but
one
of
the
employees,
mrs.
schwalb,
at
the
time
of
injury,
was
cleaning
out
coal
from
the
trunnion
rollers,
which
was
necessary
to
allow
the
dumpers
to
operate.
mr.
william
t.
prince
they
did
some
amount
of
cleaning
of
bathrooms
and
of
offices.
mr.
william
t.
prince
that...
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
t.
prince
not
schwalb
and
mcglone,
but
the
third
employee,
robert
goode,
actually
worked
up
on
the
dumper.
and
at
the
time
of
his
injury--
in
fact,
the
circuit
judge
who
heard
the
jurisdictional
evidence
in
that
case
found
that
the
overwhelming
amount
of
his
time
was...
was
done
in
the
maintenance
of
ship-loading
equipment.
he
was
a
pier
machinist.
now,
at
the
time
of
his
injury,
he
was
repairing
a
retarder,
which
is
a
piece
of
equipment
up
on
the
dumper
that
is
used
to
bring
the
cars
to
a
stop
when
they
get
to
the
position
where
they
are
to
be
dumped,
and
the
repairs
that
he
did
in
fact
brought
a
stop
to
the
operation.
repairs
had
to
be
done...
the
repairs
could
not
be
done
while
the
coal
was
being
loaded
and
the
work
stopped.
mr.
william
t.
prince
your
honor,
they
all
brought
one.
that
is
how
this
came
on.
each
one
of
them
brought
federal
employer
liability
act
claims,
and
the
railway
company
in
each
case
moved
to
dismiss
on
the
ground
that
the
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
because
the
exclusive
remedy
was
under
the
longshore
act.
mr.
william
t.
prince
they
would
most
likely
be
greater.
it...
it's
the
difference
between
a
negligence
action
and
a
compensation
remedy.
mr.
william
t.
prince
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
william
t.
prince
your
honor,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
be
a
test
of
how
essential.
i
think
the
factual
determination
is,
is
it
essential,
or
is
it
an
integral
part
of
the
loading?
there
comes
a
point
where
land
transportation
ends
and
everything
thereafter
is
the
movement
of
the
cargo
toward
the
ship
and
onto
the
ship.
all
of
that
effort...
the
movement
of
the
coal
once
land
transportation
ends...
is
an
integral
part.
as...
as
this
court
said
in
the
ford
case,
anyone
who
is
involved
in
a
portion
of
the
work
is
involved
in
an
integral
part
of
it,
and
in...
and
in
fact,
there
would
be
probably
no
worker
who
would
be
involved
in
all
of
it,
not
in...
in
today's
modernization
of
this
equipment.
everyone
is
involved
only
in
a
part
of
it.
mr.
william
t.
prince
so
i
don't
think,
your
honor--
mr.
william
t.
prince
under
the
rulings
of
the
pfeiffer
and
caputo,
if
he
spends
part
of
his
time
in
repairing
ship-loading
equipment,
he
would
be
covered
all
the
time.
mr.
william
t.
prince
--he
wouldn't...
oh,
i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
william
t.
prince
he
would
not
be
on
the
situs.
right,
he
would
not
be
on
the
situs.
he
would
not
meet
the
situs--
mr.
william
t.
prince
--on
the
situs,
and
there
was
no
question
in
this
case
that
all
three
employees
were
on...
on
a
statutory
situs
at
the
time.
so,
yes,
they
have
got
to
be
on
the
situs,
and
the
employer--
mr.
william
t.
prince
--at
the
time
of
the
injury.
mr.
william
t.
prince
that's
a
hard
question.
mr.
william
t.
prince
i
think
there
could
be,
as
the...
i
think
it's
the
9th
circuit,
in
one
case
referred
to
an
employee's
presence
on
the
waterfront,
or
on
the
situs,
as
episodic,
and
i
guess
there
could
be
an
episodic
presence
in
the
situs
that
would
exclude
that
particular
worker.
mr.
william
t.
prince
no...
rarely.
extremely
rare.
one
of
the
circuits
found--
mr.
william
t.
prince
--that
an
employee
who
spent
two
and
a
half
percent
of
his
time
on
the
situs
was
covered.
mr.
william
t.
prince
that
would
be...
yes.
i
think...
excuse
me.
mr.
william
t.
prince
if
a
timekeeper
were
merely
an
office
worker
he
would
be
excluded
by
statute,
but
if
he
were
out
in
the
area
where
the
work
was
being
done,
if
he
was
involved
in...
in
getting
the
cargo
moved,
he
would
be
covered.
the
1984
amendment
specifically
excluded
office
workers.
and
i
might
say
that
there
was
an
amendment
offered
in
1981
that
would
exclude
workers
who
were
engaged
in
repairing
and
maintaining
ship-loading
equipment
and
that
amendment
was
dropped
before
the
1984
amendments
were
enacted.
your
honor,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
william
t.
prince
i
would
like
to
respond
to
justice
stevens
as
to
why
not...
congress
may
not
have
excluded
people
who
repair
and
maintain
equipment.
in
the
pfeiffer
case,
the
worker
ford,
was
a
warehouseman
and
the
worker
bryant
was
a
cotton
header.
both
of
those
men
were
involved
in
intermediate
steps
of
loading
and
unloading.
they
were
not
the
final
step
or
the
first
step,
and
they
were
not
excluded
by
statute,
but
the
court
found
that
they
were...
that
they
were
not
covered
or
excluded
by
statute,
no
mention,
and
the
court
found
that
they
were
covered,
and
this
court
on
the
question
of--
mr.
william
t.
prince
--this
court
said
they
were
involved
in
intermediate
steps.
mr.
william
t.
prince
in
the
loading
or
unloading
operation.
mr.
william
t.
prince
the...
all
the
circuits
have
held
that.
