chief

integral
part
of

very
well,
mr.

we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
unloaded
it
into
a
ship,
didn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
suggesting
that
its
optional?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that
relevant,
that
none
of
them
filed
claims?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
we
should
disregard
the
language
of
the
statute
and
go
back
and
see
whether
the
sponsors,
or
so
to
speak,
the
lobbyists,
have
this
in
mind?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
fellow
you
spoke
about
who
was
actually
pouring
coal
into
the
hold
of
the
ship
and
was
a
rail...
railroad
worker?
i
thought
you
said
that
was
the
case
of
a
railroad
worker
who
would
be
covered?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
all
railroad
workers
aren't
excluded,
even
though
any
of
them
could
sue
under
the
fela?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
suggesting
we
repeat
that,
are
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
page?
are
you
reading
from
a
page
of
the
record?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
page?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wilcox.
mr.
prince,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
prince.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist

opinions
of
the
