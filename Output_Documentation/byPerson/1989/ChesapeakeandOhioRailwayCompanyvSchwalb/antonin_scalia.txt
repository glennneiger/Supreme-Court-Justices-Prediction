what
about
a
machinist--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
prince,
what
about
a
machinist
who...
who
works
for
the
railroad
only
in
downtown
norfolk
who...
who
repairs,
among
other
things,
one
of
these
trunnions
that's
essential
for
the
movement
of
coal?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
add
to
your
test
not
just
that
it
be
essential,
or
an
integral
part
of
the
loading
process,
but
that
it
be
done
on
the
site?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
very
nice
of
you
to
say
that
you
wouldn't
press
that...
that
argument,
but
how
could
you
avoid
pressing
that
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
light
of
the
fact
that
all
the
situs
provision
says
is,
if
you're
injured
there.
i
mean,
it's...
it's
nice
of
you
to
say
well,
we
wouldn't
press
it
if
he's
just
there
and
happens
to
be
injured
there,
but
that's
how
it
reads,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
right.
but
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
we're
talking
about
somebody
who...
who
repairs
trunnions
and
once
in
two
years
he
happens
to
go
there
to
deliver
the
trunnion
he's
repaired
and
gets
injured,
and
you're
saying
well,
we
wouldn't
press
the
applicability
of
the
situs
provision.
well,
it's
not...
it's
not
up
to
you
to
press
it.
it
seems
to
me
the
language
of
it
would
say
it
applies,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
and
i
think
you're
disagreeing
with
mr.
prince,
if...
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
i
think
he
would
say
that
even
a
worker
who
repairs
the
trunnions
down
town,
if
he
comes
up
and,
you
know,
delivers
them
once
a
month
and
gets
injured--
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he's
an
employee,
if
he
does
it...
if
he
does
work
essential
to
the
loading
operation
downtown,
isn't
he?
he
has
to
be
injured
on
the
situs,
but
does
the
situs
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
he's
an
employee
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
work
for
the
railroad.
he's...
that's
an
employer.
the
term
"employee"
means
any
person
engaged
in
maritime
employment,
including
various
things,
and
the
question
is
whether
repairing
and
maintaining
loading
equipment
is
maritime
employment,
and
the
answer,
according
to
you,
is
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it's
essential.
it
seems
to
me
if
you
do
it
in
new
york
it's
still
maritime
employment,
and
then
you
have
to
be...
you
have
to
be
injured
on...
on
the
situs.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what's
so
horrible
about
that?
i
mean,
just...
just
accept
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
the
only
consistent
position
you
can
take?
if
you
define
the
term
"maritime
employment"
by
the
character
of
the
work
the
person
does,
and
you
say
the
character
of
work
maintaining
and
repairing
equipment
is
maritime
employment,
it
doesn't
matter
where
he
does
it,
it's
maritime
employment,
and
the...
the
situs
requirement
merely
is
a
requirement
that
says
the
injury
must
occur
on
a
situs.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
it's
maritime
employment
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
a
natural
way
you
would
describe
maintenance
and
repair,
too,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
wanted
to
deliberately
cover
maintenance
and
repair
people,
you
don't
think
you'd
might
mention
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
the
people
that
were
operating
the
conveyer
belt,
too.
so
those
people
wouldn't
be
included,
right?
because
the
conveyer
belt
could
have
been
going
to
a
power
plant
instead
of
to
a
ship,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
know
where
it
was
located.
but
it
could
have
been
going
into
a
power
plant,
so
you
could
make
the
same
argument.
so
all
of
the
employees,
not
only
who
repair
the
conveyer
belt,
but
even
those
who
operated
the
conveyer
belt
shouldn't
be
covered,
because
it
could
have
been
going
somewhere
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
i
know
what
it
goes
to,
but
what's
your
answer
about
the
people
who
are
operating
the
conveyer
belt?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
leaves
you
nobody.
who...
who
is
covered?
i
mean,
do
you
have
to
be
standing
on
the
ship?
justice
antonin
scalia
we...
we
can
make
that
policy
decision?
i
thought
we
were
trying
to
interpret
a
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wilcox,
we're
dealing
with
a
statute
that
feels
it
necessary
to
specifically
except
from
the
term
"employee"
under
the
act,
individuals
who
are,
one,
employed
by
suppliers,
transporters
or
vendors;
two,
are
temporarily
doing
business;
and,
three,
are
not
engaged
in
work
normally
performed
by
employees
of
that
employer
under
this
chapter,
and...
and
a
lot
of
other
specific
exceptions,
which
would
be
unnecessary
if
your
interpretation
of
the
act
were
the
interpretation
that
congress
accepted
and
intended.
for
instance,
the
exception
for
individuals
employed
exclusively
to
perform
office,
clerical,
secretarial,
security
or
data
processing
work.
if
your
interpretation
were
accepted,
you
wouldn't
need
that
exception.
it'd...
it'd
be
a
meaningless,
senseless
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
has
to
meet
the
other
two...
the
other
requirements.
justice
antonin
scalia
two,
are
temporarily
doing
business
on
the
premises,
and
three,
are
not
engaged
in
work
normally
performed
by
employees
of
that
employer
under
this
chapter,
and
here,
this
is
work
normally
performed
by
employees
of
that
employer.
justice
antonin
scalia
sometimes
the
laws
that
congress
writes
don't
completely
do
what
you
hope
they'll
do,
but
the
law
is
there.
i
mean--
--mr.
wilcox?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wilcox,
i
thought
you
gave
up
that
argument?
i
mean,
you
keep
saying
it,
but
you
acknowledged
in
response
to
justice
stevens
that
you
cannot
argue
that
no
railroad
workers
were
covered.
didn't
you
answer
that
in
response
to
justice...?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then,
you're
not
saying
that
congress
did
not
intend
railroad
workers
to
be
covered.
it
clearly
did.
we're
just
arguing
over
what
railroad
workers
will
be
covered.
isn't
that
right?
