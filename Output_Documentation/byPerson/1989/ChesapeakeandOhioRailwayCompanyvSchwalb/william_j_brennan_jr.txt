even
though,
in
this
instance,
it
were
limited
to
cleaning
the...
the
fallen
coal?
where
you
told
us
that--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--that
would
be
enough
to
bring
them
within
coverage?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
did
they
do
any
repair
work
on
damaged
equipment
or
anything?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
incidentally,
did
any
of
the
three
employees
bring
a...
a
federal
employer
liability
act
suit?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
whereas
damages,
i
gather,
under
the
fela
are
likely
to
be
greater
than
the
compensation
under
the
longshore
act?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
what
about
a
timekeeper
working
on
the
situs?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
if
there's
coverage
under
the
longshore
act,
that's
the
only
remedy,
isn't
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
your
clients
could
not
have
causes
of
action
both
under
the
fela
and
the
longshore
act.
