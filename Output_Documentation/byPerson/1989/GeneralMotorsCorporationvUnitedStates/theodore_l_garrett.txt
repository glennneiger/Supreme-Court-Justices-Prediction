mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
central
issues
concerning
the
adoption
and
the
enforcement
of
state
air
control
regulations
under
the
clean
air
act.
the
question
presented
is,
in
a
case
where
a
state
has
revised
its
regulations,
whether
epa
may
bring
a
suit
to
enforce
the
original
unrevised
regulations
and
to
collect
penalties
without
first
complying
with
its
statutory
duty
to
act
to
approve
or
disapprove
the
revision.
we
request
that
the
decision
below
be
reversed
because
it
allows
epa
to
veto
state
regulatory
choices
through
an
enforcement
mechanism
without
following
the
procedures
and
requirements
of
the
statute.
we
submit
that
this
procedure
epa
is
following
creates
a
regulatory
limbo
which
frustrates
the
efforts
of
states
and
companies
to
respond
to
changing
conditions.
now,
i
want
to
clarify
at
the
outset
that
our
point
is
not
simply
that
epa
took
too
long
in
acting
on
the
revision
in
question
here.
our
point
is
a
more
fundamental
one
than
that.
we
submit
that
congress
established
a
very
careful
sequence
in
the
statute,
first,
for
the
state
promulgation
of
state
implementation
plans
and
revisions
to
those
plans,
secondly,
for
limited
and
timely
epa
review
of
those
plans
and,
only
after
that,
for
enforcement.
we
submit
that
by
skipping
that
second
step,
the
limited
and
timely
review,
epa
has
put
the
cart
before
the
horse,
if
you
will.
now,
in
this
case,
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
gave
general
motors
an
extension
of
time,
from
1985
to
1987,
1987
being
the
attainment
deadline
in
the
clean
air
act
that's
relevant
here
and,
indeed,
it
was
the
deadline
for
all
of
massachusetts,
as
granted
by
epa.
the
purpose
of
the
extension
was
to
allow
general
motors
to
replace
an
older
painting
facility
that
it
had
in
framingham,
massachusetts
and
instead
to
build
a
new
more
modern
facility
with
substantially
lower
emissions.
epa
had
previously
approved
similar
extensions
of
time
through
state
plan
revisions
for
other
companies
in
1984
and
1985,
and
the
agency
did
so
pursuant
to
a
policy
that
it
had
announced
in
1981.
in
this
particular
case,
epa
waited
while
general
motors
built
its
plant.
it
completed
the
new
facility
at
great
expense
in
july
of
1987,
and
then
when
the
new
facility
was
built
and
the
old
facility
was
shut
down,
epa
filed
a
lawsuit
in
august
of
1987
to
collect
penalties
for
the
period
of
time
during
which
the
company
had
operated
the
old
paint
shop.
it
did
so
without
taking
any
action...
any
final
action
on
a
revision.
now,
we
submit
that
general
motors
should
have
been
entitled
to
comply
with
the
commonwealth's
revision
and
should
have
not
been
penalized
for
doing
so
until
epa
took
action
on
the
revision.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
are
you
referring
to
section
110(d)
of
the
statute,
your
honor?
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
your
honor,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
government's
argument
with
respect
to
that
section
proves
a
little
bit
too
much,
and
it's
somewhat
a
mechanical
and
artificial
reading
of
the
statute.
and
the
reason
we
say
that
is
because
it
does
not
deal
with
epa's
corresponding
duty
under
the
statute
to
comply
with
its
obligations
to
review
a
plan
in
a
timely
way.
we
submit
that
the
congress--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--we
disagree
on
that
point,
your
honor.
but
there's
a
more
fundamental
point
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize.
i
think
that
there
can
be
no
doubt
under
the
statute,
because
it
uses
the
word
epa
has
a
duty
to
act
on
the
plan
and
plan
revisions.
and
we're
saying
that
epa
has
breached
that
duty
act.
whether
it's
four
months
or
a
reasonable
time--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--they
should
be
acting
before
they
bring
lawsuits.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
the...
if
you're
referring
to
subsection
(a)(3),
that
section
deals
entirely
with
revisions,
and
we
believe--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--the
language
of
the
statute,
i
think,
your
honor,
we
have
to
be
careful
not
to
try
to
parse
it
a
little
bit
too
fine
but
to
look
to
the
overall
intent
of
it.
in
our
reply
brief
we
pointed
out
one
example
where
epa
does
not
interpret
the
language
to
refer
only
to
the
requirements
of
the
plan.
and
in
particular
the
first
sentence
of
section
(a)(2)
states
that
the
administrator
may
approve
or
disapprove
a
plan
or
a
portion
of
a
plan.
there
is
no
reference
to
a
portion
of
a
plan
in
section
(3)(a).
but
yet
the
administrator
in
the
public
service
case
has
said
congress
basically
intended
these
two
provisions
to
work
the
same
way
and
the
administrator
has
the
same
obligations
and
responsibilities
under
(a)(2)
as
it
does
under
(a)(3).
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
our
view,
your
honor,
is
that
the
language
is
intended
to
be
a
provision
of
incorporation,
and
it's
plain,
to
us
anyway,
that
congress
intended
to
incorporate
all
of
(a)(2)
into
(a)(3).
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
i
really
don't.
i
think
it's
a
very
strained
reading
for
the
government
to
say
that
every
provision
of
(a)(2)
is
incorporated
in
(a)(3)
with
the
exception
of
the
four-month
rule.
and
if
you
go
word
by
word
almost
to
see
what
provisions
the
government
believes
are
incorporated
and
which
are
not,
they
believe
that
everything
is
incorporated
except
the
four-month
rule.
i
don't
think
that
there's
any
indication
in
the
statute
that
congress
intended
to
carve
out
that
one
provision.
and
we
think
that
all
of
the
lower
courts
and
all
of
the
amici
that
have
filed
briefs
with
this
court
are
correct
in
assuming
that
congress
intended
that.
and
we
think
that
the
proof
of
the
pudding
is
section
110(g)
of
the
act,
which
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief
requires
epa
to
comply
with
the
plan
revisions...
to
act
on
certain
plan
revisions,
quote,
(a)(3).
but
again--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
the
only
reference
that's
logical
is
the
required
period
for
epa
to
act
on
the
revisions
under
section
(a)(3).
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
statute
does--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--again,
your
honor,
there's
some
distinctions
that
could
be
made.
i
think
that
the
government
argues
that
plans
are
never
required
after
the
original
plans
and,
therefore,
that
can't
apply.
i
think--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--it
assumes
that
congress
really
didn't
intend
that
there
be
prompt
action
on
revisions
and
that
revisions
somehow
were
less
important
than
the
original
plans.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
let's
assume--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--let's
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
four-month
provision
is
not
applicable
and
that
epa's
duty
is
to
act
within
a
reasonable
time.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
what
that
leads
to
is
this,
your
honor,
and
this
is
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
a
moment
ago.
under
the
court's
decision
in
the
train
v.
nrdc
case,
epa
must
approve
a
revision
if
it
satisfies
the
basic
requirements
of
the
statute.
and
what
epa
has
done
here
is
that
they've
invented
a
new
option.
what
they
do
is
they
exercise
a
pocket
veto
by
ignoring
a
revision
while
bringing
a
suit
to
enforce
the
old
plan.
this,
in
effect,
disapproves
the
revision
without
any
of
the
restrictions
on
epa
authority
that
are
in
the
statute.
and
indeed,
it
provides
incentives
for
epa
to
delay
further
in
order
to
advance
its
enforcement
action.
now,
by
proceeding
in
this
way,
it
seems
to
us,
that
epa
is
leaving
the
states
and
industry
in
a
regulatory
limbo.
it
undercuts
state
efforts
to
develop
and
enforce
revised
plans
for
improved
control
strategies.
it
removes
any
incentives
that
industry
would
have
to
accept
and
implement
revisions
that
would
make
progress.
and
we
submit
that
these
consequences
are
totally
inconsistent
with
the
goals
of
the
act,
and
they
are
inconsistent
with
the
basic
obligation
that
epa
has
in
the
statute
where
it
says
the
administrator
shall
approve
any
revision.
and
even
if
it's
not
four
months,
even
if
it's
a
reasonable
time,
he's
obligated
to
approve
that
revision
if
it
meets
the
basic
requirements
of
the
act
because
the
states
have
the
primarily
role
in
establishing
a
mission
limitations.
and
by
exercising
this
pocket
veto
what
the
agency
is
doing
is
writing
the
states
out
of
the
statute
and
saying
we're
going
to
ignore
what
you
do
and
we're
going
to
bring
enforcement
action
to
enforce
our
choices
and
not
yours.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
that
was
the
remedy
that
the
court
of
appeals
suggested...
or,
at
least
one
of
the
two
remedies
that
the
court
of
appeals
suggested,
your
honor.
and
we
respectfully
suggest
that
that's
not
very
meaningful.
let's
think
about
what
would
be
involved
in
doing
that.
under
the
government's
approach,
the
district
court
would
be
required
to
consider
whether
the
revised
plan
was,
quote,
"clearly
approvable
or
clearly
not
approvable.
"
and
it
would
be
doing
so
well
before
the
agency
itself
had
acted.
for
example,
in
the
cyanamid
case
which
we
rely
on
heavily
in
our
briefs,
that
was
a
1982
plan
revision.
the
court
of
appeals
handed
down
its
decision
in
1987
after
a
full
round
of
administrative
proceedings
concerning
the
amount
of
the
penalty.
to
this
day
there's
been
no
final
decision
by
epa
on
that
sip
revision.
it
seems
to
us
that
this
approach
of
requiring
a
district
court
judge
to
make
a
decision
as
to
whether
a
plan
was
clearly
approvable
or
not
really
turns
notions
of
primary
jurisdiction
on
their
head.
the
agency
should
be
making
that
determination
first.
and
that's
the
basic
problem
that
we've
got.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
that--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--that's
quite
right,
your
honor.
and
that's
not
our
position,
by
the
way.
and
let
me
try
to
make
it
clear
if
i
haven't.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
no,
your
honor,
we
go
a
step
further
than
that.
our
position
is
that
epa
has
a
fundamental
duty
under
the
statute
to
first
act
on
the
revision,
up
or
down,
before
it
brings
an
enforcement
action.
and
we're
not
going
to
ask
the
district
courts
to
look
at
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
time
on
the
four-month
rule.
we
think
that
the
four-month
rule
is
very
important
because
it
underscores
the
urgency
of
epa
to
act,
but
there
can
be
no
question
to
us
that
the
statute
imposes
a
mandatory
duty
on
epa
to
act
on
those
plans
and
that
they
should
be
prohibited
from
bringing
an
enforcement
action.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
yes,
your
honor.
during
that
period
of
time
epa
should
be
making
a
neutral,
unbiased
decision
on
whether
that
plan--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--was
approvable
or
not.
it
shouldn't
be...
they
shouldn't
be
rushing
to
court
to
enforce
a
regulation
when
there
hasn't
been
a...
determination
made
under
the
statute
as
to
what
regulation
ought
to
be
enforced.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
your
honor,
there
is
not
a
particular
provision
in
the
sense
of
language
saying
that
epa
may
not
bring
an
enforcement
action.
however,
we
suggest
that...
several
things.
that
the
mandatory
in
the
language
in
the
statute
saying
that
they
are
obligated
to
approve,
the
language
in
the
statute
saying
in
several
places...
in
the
preamble
to
the
case
and
to
the
statute
in
the
declaration
of
findings
and
purpose...
that
the
prevention
and
control
of
pollution
at
its
source
is
the
primarily
responsibility
of
the
state
and
local
governments,
and
in
section
7407(a)
which
says
that
each
state
shall
have
the
primary
responsibility
for
assuring
air
quality
within
its
entire
geographic
area.
the
states
don't
have
that
authority
if
epa
is
allowed
to
just
ignore
state
plans,
pick
and
choose
among
revisions
and
original
plans,
and
if
it
prefers
the
original
plan
rather
than
the
revision
for
any
reason
or
no
reason
at
all,
without
following
the
statutory
procedures,
to
just
go
ahead
and
enforce
the
original
plan.
we
submit
that
that
is
so
contrary
to
the
fundamental
workings
of
the
statute
that
this
court
should
devise
a
remedy
to
deal
with
that
situation.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
the...
to
some
extent,
your
honor,
the
revision
certainly
would
be
enforceable
in
state
court.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
we
believe
so,
your
honor.
in
fact--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--yes,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--the
clean
air
act...
the
way
it's
structured,
your
honor,
requires
that
before
a
state
submits
a
plan
to
epa
that
it
be
adopted
as
a
matter
of
state
law
and
they
be
able
to
show
epa
at
the
time
that
it's
submitted
that
it's
been
promulgated
and
enforced.
and
the
states
go
through
substantial
procedures
of
their
own
to
establish
these
revisions.
they're
required
by
statute
to
have
public
hearings.
and
in
this
case
massachusetts
did
have
hearings.
the
public
was
invited;
the
american
lung
association
appeared
and
did
not
object
to
the
revision.
epa
had
advance
notice
of
this.
these
revisions
aren't
a
surprise.
epa
had
been
talking
to
the
commonwealth
about
this;
they
appeared
at
the
hearings.
they
had
some
technical
comments,
but
they
did
not
object.
massachusetts
believed
that
it
satisfied
all
of
its
concerns,
and
after
considering
all
of
the
concerns
of
interested
parties
and
the
public,
the
state
decided
that
it
was
in
the
best
interest
of
the
citizens
of
the
state
to
go
ahead
with
this
revision,
to
allow
general
motors
to
build
a
more
modern,
lower
emission
facility
and
extend
the
deadline
to
the
statutory
deadline
that
epa
had
already
approved.
we
submit
that--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--yes,
and
that's
very
puzzling,
your
honor.
we
would
urge
the
court
to
look
at
the
brief
filed
by
the
national
governors'
association.
we
think
that
it's
much
more
representative
of
the
views
of
state
and
local
officials
concerning
these
issues.
the
massachusetts
brief
is
frankly
puzzling
and
incomprehensible
to
us.
the...
i
can
elaborate
some
more,
if
you'd
like.
[laughter]
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
the...
massachusetts
certainly
believed,
and
still
believes
that
the
plan
revision
involved
was
in
the
public
interest,
and
i
would
on
that
point
urge
the
court
to
look
at
the
1987
comments
by
the
state
of
massachusetts
that
we've
lodged
with
the
clerk
of
the
court.
when
epa
had
eventually
proposed
to
disapprove
the
plan,
the
state
of
massachusetts
filed
very
vigorous
comments
with
epa
saying
that
this
is
a
good
revision
and
your
concerns
are
unwarranted.
we
want
this
approved.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
certainly,
your
honor.
we
have
two
responses
to
that.
one
is
that
we
and
the
government
disagree
on
the
interpretation
of
that
language
of
110(g).
we
believe
that
that
was
an
emergency
provision
that
was
designed
to
deal
with
imminent
plant
closings
and
in
a
situation
where
the
state
really
couldn't
even
afford
to
wait
the
four
months.
so
what
congress
did
was
allow
the
states
the
authority
to,
in
those
situations,
suspend
immediately
without
waiting
for
the
four-month
period
to...
to--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--well,
eventually
epa
would,
but
during
the--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--oh,
yes.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
we
would
urge
the
court
to
not
read
section
110(g)
as
an
exclusive
remedy,
basically,
which
is
our
second
provision.
there
are
a
number
of
provisions
in
the
statute,
110(g),
110(f),
that
provide
for
special
relief.
in
fact,
the
train
case,
which
we
rely
very
heavily
on,
involved
just
that
kind
of
an
issue.
there
was
a
provision
for
certain
kinds
of
variances
in
the
statute
that
the
state
of
georgia
wanted
to
provide.
but
the
state
of
georgia
wanted
to
do
it
by
a
sip
revision
rather
than
using
110(f).
and
they
said
that
that
was
the
exclusive
provision
in
the
statute.
if
you
could
do
it
by
a
sip
revision,
why
have
a
sip
revision?
and
this
court
held
no,
that
the
sip
revisions
are
the
basic
mechanism
under
the
act
for
states
to
make
these
kinds
of
choices.
and
the
fact
that
congress
may
have
provided
some
particular
remedies
doesn't
make
them
exclusive.
so
we
would
say
that
the
fact
that
section
110(g)
of
the
statute
is
there
doesn't
at
all
conflict
with
the
remedy
that
we're
urging.
in
fact,
in
some
way
we
think
that
since
congress
never
thought
about
this
problem,
it
supports
it.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
the
very
first
plans
under
the
clean
air
act?
i
think,
quite
frankly,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--no.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
i
think
that
the...
my
impression
is
that
when
we're
talking
about
the
original
70
clean
air
act,
that
the
states
were
trying
to
get
the
plans
into
epa
in
a
hurry,
that
epa
tried
to
act
in
four
months.
i
don't
believe
they
acted
in
four
months
in
every
case.
and
eventually
epa
ended
up
approving
and
disapproving
the
various
plans.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
that's
correct.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
that's
right.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
and
the
reason
is--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
that's
right,
although
as
a
practical
matter
that
situation
would
virtually
never
arise.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
yes.
under
the
statute
they're
required
to
give
30
days'
notice.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
and
then
they
can
bring
an
enforcement
action
if
violations
occur
beyond
the
30th
day.
so
the
likelihood
of
that
hypothetical
would
ever
arise
and
a
suit
would
be
filed
within
the
four
months
is
quite
remote.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
that's
right.
what
we're
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
the
company
needs
someplace
to
look
as
to
its
compliance
obligations.
and
in
a
situation
where
the
state--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--well,
if
it's--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--it's
hard
in
two
respects.
if
you
believe
that
state
choices
are
really
supposed
to
have
primacy
under
the
statute,
and
indeed
the
state
can
go
into
state
court
and
enforce
the
revision
against
the
company,
we
think
that
it's
fundamentally
unfair
to
put
a
company
in
that
position
of
being
subject
to
conflicting
obligations--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--what
we're
saying...
now,
the
cyanamid
court
actually
adopted
a
slightly
different
approach.
they
said
you
could
start
the
clock
running
after
the
four
months.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
our
position
is
that
the
company
should
look
to
state
law
and
be
expected
to
follow
what
the
state
adopted
after
public
hearings
until
epa
makes
a
decision
one
way
or
the
other,
because
epa
is
in
a
state
of
neutrality
at
that
point
and
the
company
ought
to
be
able
to
assume--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
other
alternative
which
would
allow
epa
in
effect
to
veto
state
plans
that
are
very
well
considered
plans
adopted
after
public
hearings
and
by
the
entity
of
government
that
congress
really
entrusted
to
make
these
decisions,
would
basically
switch
the
presumption...
it
would
be...
you'd
have
a
situation
where
all
state
plans
are
presumed
disapproved
under
the
statute
even
though
epa
had
not
made
any
showing
that
there
were
any
grounds
for
such
disapproval.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
the
fifth
circuit
approach
is
the
approach
that
comes
closest
to
our
position,
yes.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--with...
with
one
small
qualification.
if
there
are
common
elements
of
the
two...
in
other--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--words,
if
the
original
plan
says
a
plus
b
and
they've
been
revised--
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
--and
the
plan
says
a
plus
c
and
it's
intended
that
there
is
some
separate
element,
yes,
certainly
the
agency
can
enforce
under
that
circumstance.
but
basically
where
there's...
to
the
extent
that
there's
a
revision,
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
states
can
enforce
the
revision
and
epa
should
be
barred
from
enforcement.
and
that
bar
serves
as
a
salutary
purpose.
it
serves
to
encourage
the
agency
to
act
promptly
so
that
there
can
be
a
consensus
between
the
federal
and
state
governments
as
to
what
should
be
enforced.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
theodore
l.
garrett
just
a
few
brief
points,
your
honor.
in
response
to
the
last
point
concerning
emergencies,
it
should
be
understood
that
our
position
is
that
epa
does
have
authority
under
a
separate
provision
of
the
statute
to
deal
with
those,
and
we
would
not
claim
a
bar
to
deal
with
those
kinds
of
emergencies.
our
request
for
a
bar
only
deals
with
state
implementation
plans.
with
respect
to
the
commingling
point
and
mr.
wallace's
comments
about
the
government
policy
with
respect
to
the
negotiations
of
a
dco,
the
negotiations
were
simply
that
the
government
wanted
gm
to
pay
penalties
as
a
price
for
getting
the
sip
revision.
they
weren't
asking
gm
to
make
any
other
improvements
or
do
anything
else.
they
had
just
changed
their
policies
on
whether
or
not
sip
revisions
could
be
allowed
for
these
purposes
as
a
revision
or
whether
a
dco
with
penalties
was
the
appropriate
remedy.
and
i
would
urge
the
court
to
look
at
the
hannish
memo...
it's
a
may
1986
memorandum
by
an
epa
official
that
we've
lodged
with
the
court.
it
demonstrates
the
moving
target
problem
in
our
brief.
mr.
wallace
said
that
the
cyanamid
remedy,
or
the
temporary
bar
on
enforcement
is
an
extreme
remedy.
well,
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
mandamus
remedy,
or
the
first
circuit's
remedies,
are
much
more
intrusive
and
extreme
than
the
remedy
that
we
propose.
