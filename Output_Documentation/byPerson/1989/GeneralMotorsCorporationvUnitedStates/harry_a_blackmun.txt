justice
blackmun
on
the
other
hand,
massachusetts,
your
commonwealth,
is
opposing
you
here,
isn't
it?
justice
blackmun
i'd
like
to
some
elaboration
on
one
point,
mr.--
--i'm
only
pointing
out
that
your
own...
the
state
involved
is
on
the
other
side.
justice
blackmun
maybe,
again,
mr.
wallace,
we're
dealing
with
very
bad
draftsmanship
in
congress.
it's
not
the
first
time.
