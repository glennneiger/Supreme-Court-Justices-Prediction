mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
preface
my
remarks
by
pointing
out
that
the
time
limitations
that
were
specified
in
the
act
in
1970
in
order
to
get
the
states
to
make
prompt
submissions
and
epa
to
move
on
them
within
four
months
were
designed
to
get
into
place
protections
of
the
public
health
which
were
not
yet
in
place
under
the
previous
versions
of
the
clean
air
act.
and
enforcement
authority
was
included
in
the
1970
act
so
that
these
protections
of
the
public
health
of
the
breathing
public
would
be
in
place
and
enforceable.
the
enforcement
authority
was
given
both
to
the
epa
and
to
citizen
suits,
and
citizen
suits
could
also
be
brought
by
the
states
under
the
definition
of
who
is
a
person
in
the
act
who
can
bring
a
citizens'
suit.
but
the
primary
enforcement
authority
was
in
the
epa.
in
order
to
bring
a
citizens'
suit,
the
epa
first
must
be
notified
and
the
citizen
suit
can
proceed
only
if
the
epa
has
not
brought
a
suit
and
is
not
diligently
prosecuting
it.
so
that
petitioner's
submission
at
oral
argument
would
turn
around
the
explicit
priorities
of
the
enforcement
provisions
as
well
as
undermine
the
basic
purpose
of
what
after
all
was
entitled
the
clean
air
act,
which
was
to
get
protections
for
the
breathing
public
in
place.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
absolutely.
that
is
part
of
our
submission,
that
it
is
a
duty
imposed
by
the
administrative
procedure
act
in--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
think
the
court
of
appeals
reached
the
correct
answer,
which
is,
yes,
with
two
qualifications.
one
is
that
in
determining
what
penalties,
if
any,
are
appropriate,
all
of
these
questions
of
the
equities
of
the
particular
case
will
be
taken
into
account
in
the
penalty
proceeding.
and
the
other
is
that
mandamus
actions
do
lie
to
get
the
epa
to
act.
but
i
must
point
out
that
in
this
case
the
epa
has
disapproved
this
proposed
revision,
so
that
it
is
not
exactly
petitioner's
situation
that
is
posed
in
the
hypothetical.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
a
case
is
pending
now
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
in
which
petitioner
is
challenging
the
disapproval.
we
recount
that
in
our
brief.
so
i'd
like
now
to
point
out
that
if
we
analyze
petitioner's
claim
and
the
american
cyanamid
rule
adopted
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
relation
to
the
statute
that
is
before
the
court,
the
extraordinary
lack
of
legal
footing
for
this
claim
is
revealed.
and
our
analysis
proceeds
in
five
short
steps,
which
i
can
summarize
very
briefly.
the
first
is
that
it
is
undisputed
and
cannot
be
disputed
under
this
court's
decision
in
train
that
petitioner's
legal
obligation
under
the
statute
is
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
a
sip
that
is
in
place.
that's
what
the
court
held
in
train.
and
here
the
sip
was
adopted...
the
state
implementation
plan
was
adopted
by
massachusetts
and
approved
by
epa
to
address
massachusetts'
very
serious
ozone
problem.
two,
the
act
explicitly
confers
authority
on
the
government
to
bring
an
enforcement
suit
against
a
source
of
emissions
for
failure
to
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
sip.
now,
number
three--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--a
suit
could
be
brought.
there
is
enforcement
authority.
the
act
is
concerned
with
damage
to
the
public
health
that
occurs--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
although,
as
a
matter
of
enforcement
policy,
epa
does
not
ordinarily
bring
such
suits.
we've
pointed
that
out
in
footnote
32
of
our
brief
on
page
29
and
explained
the
enforcement
policy
that
epa
has
been
following.
now,
to
return
to
my
brief
analysis
here--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--epa
even
testified
in
the
state
proceedings
that
it
had
doubts
about
it.
and
there
was
considerable
communication
between
the
state
and
federal
authorities,
as
there
should
be.
this
is
an
act
that
contemplates
cooperation
between
the
state
and
federal
authorities.
of
course,
epa
could
not
state
a
concluded
view
in
the
state
proceedings,
but
it
did
certainly
indicate
its
doubts.
and
it
urged
the
state
authorities
to
pursue
the
course
they
did,
which
was
to
try
to
negotiated
a
so-called
delayed
compliance
order,
which
would
have
required
general
motors
before
making
this
major
technological
change
to
take
some
steps
to
improve
the
emissions
situation
as
it
was
existing.
it
would
have
set
up
a
schedule
of
improvements.
but
those
negotiations
failed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
or
the
scheme--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--even
if
we
thought
it
appropriate
to
prosecute
everybody,
it
would
be
hard
to
devote
the
resources
to
that
endeavor.
and
the
scheme
congress
adopted
is
one
which
does
not
remove
prosecutorial
discretion
and
still
confers
the
responsibility
to
pass
on
these
proposed
revisions.
and
we
think
of
it
the
other
way
around.
if
somebody
is
making
satisfactory
progress,
that's
not
the
place
to
devote
our
limited
enforcement
resources,
even
though
the
progress
may
not
be
ideal
and
there
might
actually
be
legal
liability.
it's
just
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
in
this
little
analysis
i
thought
i
would
mention
these
three
more
points.
number
three,
the
petitioner
is
asking
the
courts
to
erect
a
bar
to
the
exercise
of
the
government's
explicit
enforcement
authority
even
though
no
such
bar
appears
in
the
text
of
the
statute
itself
or
is
adverted
to
in
any
way
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
nothing
is
pointed
to
that
shows
that
it
was
at
all
contemplated
by
congress
in
enacting
it.
and
at
least
the
american
cyanamid
court...
and
petitioner
hasn't
totally
renounced
it...
that
court
based
this
judicially
created
enforcement
bar
on
epa's
failure
to
complete
regulatory
action
on
a
proposed
sip
revision
within
a
four-month
period
supposedly
required
by
the
statute
even
though
that
alleged
four-month
requirement
also
does
not
appear
in
the
text
of
the
statute
and
is
not
adverted
to
in
any
way
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute.
and
my
fifth
point
in
this
brief
analysis
is
that
petitioner
seeks
to
justify
its
proposed
judicial
building
of
inference
on
inference
here
to
supersede
the
statutory
text
on
the
ground
that
otherwise
the
act's
overall
policy
of
state
and
federal
cooperation
will
be
distorted
to
the
prejudice
of
the
states.
and
yet
massachusetts,
the
state
whose
interests
are
involved
here,
joined
by
12
other
states,
has
filed
a
brief
in
this
court
stating,
for
very
cogent
reasons...
and
i
commend
this
brief
to
the
court's
attention...
that
their
interests
are
better
served
by
the
government's
ability
to
enforce
the
act
according
to
its
terms.
and
it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
brief
was
earlier
filed,
and
i
think
the
massachusetts
brief
which
was
filed
along
with
ours
as
a
bottom-side
brief
took
into
account
that
submission
and
improved
on
it
considerably.
the...
the
chief
problem
that
we
have
with
the
national
governors'
association
brief
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--is...
well,
it
goes
part
way.
it
says
there
should
be
no
enforcement
bar,
but
it
assigns...
it
would
have
the
court
assign
to
the
district
court
in
the
penalty
proceeding--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
entire
authority
that
the
act
places
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
reviewing
epa's
action
in
disapproving
a
proposed
sip.
it
equates
the
role
of
the
reviewing
court
reviewing
administrative
action
under
this
court's
decision
in
harrison
against
ppg
industries,
with
the
proper
role
of
the
district
court
in
one
of
these
enforcement
proceedings.
so,
i
would
have
to
commend
the
massachusetts
brief
as
the
better
reasoned
of
the
two
briefs,
with
all
respect.
now,
in
developing
a
couple
of
these
points
briefly,
there
is
a
sixth
point
that
i
hope
to
make,
and
that
is
that
even
if
it
would
ever
be
appropriate
for
courts
to
erect
an
enforcement
bar
in
the
circumstances
i
have
outlined,
it
would
not
be
appropriate
here,
in
this
act
it
would
be
a
misfit
that
would
be
out
of
phase
with
other
provisions
and
policies
of
the
act.
now--
--well,
on
that
point,
it
is
true
that
section
110(g)
creates
just
such
an
enforcement
bar
in
a
particular
situation.
so
it's
not
a
totally
wild
suggestion.
it...
it
is...
it
is
the
fact
that
an
enforcement
bar
in
limited
circumstances
has
been
provided
by
congress
in
the
act
which,
under
this
court's
jurisprudence,
cuts
more
in
our
favor
than
against
our
point
because
it
shows
that
congress,
when
it
thought
it
was
appropriate,
knew
how
to
draft
an
enforcement
bar,
did
draft
an
enforcement
bar--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we...
we
have
addressed
that
in
our
brief
to
the
best
of
our
ability.
we--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
suggest
that
the
way
that
provision
evolved
may
be
an
explanation
of
why
there
was
a
reference
to
a
required
four-month
period.
the
provision
was
dealing
entirely
with
this
temporary
emergency
suspension
authority
that
it...
it
deals
with
and
that
was
the
focus
of
congressional
attention.
and
the
conclusion
that
we
have
come
to
is
that
it
contemplates
that
in
those
situations
epa
should
act
within
four
months.
but
it
does
not
in
terms
impose
a
four-month
requirement
nor
is
there
a
requirement
elsewhere
imposed
in
the
act,
nor
was
it
adopted
at
the
time
the
1970
provisions
that
petitioner
is
relying
on
were
adopted.
so,
this
is
a...
a...
something
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
they
can
shed
light
on
one
another.
and
we
have
attempted
to
reconcile
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
in
a
way
that
will
help
them
to
fit
together.
there
is
legislative
consideration
now
of
further
amendments
to
the
act,
and
while--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
certainly
would.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
there
should
be
no
enforcement
bar
nonetheless.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
are
entirely
content
with
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
even
though
we
think
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
saying--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
hesitated
because
of
that.
but
even
though
they
have
all
said
the
emperor
is
draped
in
that,
we
cannot
find
it
in
the
statute.
we
don't--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--think
it
makes--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--much
sense.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it...
it
remains
the
same
as
the
first
circuit's
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
see...
well,
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
question
in
the
penalty
phase
is
whether
there
was
unreasonable
delay
by
epa
to
the
prejudice
of...
the
company
and
how
that
should
be
taken
into
account.
and
the...
the
four-month
interpretation
is
largely
beside
the
point.
to
some
extent
it
may
mean
that
four
months
is
by
definition
not
unreasonable,
if
the
statute
has
specified
a
four-month
period.
but
we
think
it
can
be
distracting
because
it's
not
there,
it's
impractical.
there
were
very
plausible
reasons
for
congress
to
make
a
difference
between
the
time
for
acting
on
the
initial
submissions
and
the
time
for
acting
on
proposed
revisions.
and
we
don't
think
that
distraction
should
be
part
of
this
court's
analysis.
there's
certain--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we...
we
take
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--as
a
guide
that
in
the
situation
when
the
state
brings
to
our
attention
that
it's
a
temporary
emergency
suspension-type
of
situation,
where
the
governor
is
at
least
contemplating
invoking
that
authority,
that
epa
is
supposed
to
act
within
four
months.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
can
then
suspend
it
for
four
months.
as
we
read
that
statute,
that
is
after
the
four-month
period
within...
in
which
it
is
pending
before
epa.
that
statute
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
on
the
very
first
page
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
and
the
governor's
authority--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--after
the
little
inset
part--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
says,
which
the
administrator
has
not
approved
or
disapproved
under
this
section
within
the
required
four-month
period.
so
it
seems
to
us
plain
on
the
face
of
it
that
the
governor's
suspension
authority
arises
if
the
administrator
has
not
approved
or
disapproved
within
four
months.
and
it
just
doesn't
precede
that.
and
that
is
why
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
that
this
provision
in
1977
indicated
that
congress
thought
no
enforcement
bar
would
otherwise
be
available
and
congress
had
to
provide
a
limited
enforcement
bar
for
this
situation
of
the
temporary
emergency
suspensions.
and
even
there
where
they
thought
an
enforcement
bar
would
be
warranted,
they
limited
it
to
a
four-month
suspension.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
in
interpreting
the
act
as
not
otherwise
allowing
the
courts
to
impose
an
enforcement
bar,
it
was
reconciling
the
'77
amendments
with
the
'70
act.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
really
understated
it
because
otherwise
the
'77
amendment
would
be
that
the
temporary
emergency
suspensions
would
have
only
a
four-month
enforcement
bar
and
other
proposed
revisions
would
have
an
indefinite
enforcement
bar.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
think...
yes.
the
answer
is
yes
and
we
think
that
it
evolved
because
there
was
a
requirement
at
one
time
in
the
house
version
of
that
bill
in
1977.
and
there
may
not
have
been
an
adjustment
in
the
statutory
language.
but
that
has
to
be
surmise
on
anyone's
part.
the
background
of
the...
of
the
consideration
of
that
amendment
would
suggest
why
it
may
be
worded
that
way,
mr.
justice.
and
that's
the
best
we
can
say
about
it.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
mr.
justice,
i
thought
we
were
quite
clearly
saying
that
the
four-month
requirement
does
not
apply
and
would
be
impractical
to
try
to
apply--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--if...
if--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
don't
believe
it
applies
to
us,
and
that
is
our
submission
to
this
court.
we're
not,
in
our
view,
violating
the
statute.
it
certainly
is
not
an
express
requirement
of
the
statute,
and
we've
explained
in
some
detail
in
our
brief
why
the
notice
and
comment
procedure
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
the
difficulties
in
making
the
scientific
determinations
that
must
precede
the
proposed
approval
or
disapproval
that's
to
be
published
to
institute
the
notice
and
comment
procedure,
the
fact
that
methodologies
vary
so
much
among
the
states
that
it's
often
necessary
for
both
the
epa
regional
office
and
for
the
national
staff
to
be
involved
because
of--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we're...
we're
doing
the
best
we
can,
but
we...
we--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we're...
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
are
other
obligations
under
the
act,
substantive
obligations
in
the
way
we're
to
handle
these
proposed
revisions,
which
have
to
be
reconciled
with
whatever
time
limit
the
courts
might
think
is
the
statutory
guide
to
regulatory
action.
i...
i...
i
will
say
that
this
question
is
getting
explicit
consideration
in
the
current
amendments,
which
are
still
in
an
early
stage.
but
the
senate
committee,
the
senate
environment
committee,
has
reported
out
a
bill
which
is
now
on
the
floor
of
the
senate.
that
bill
is
s.
1630,
and
for
the
first
time
it
explicitly
does
have
a
time
limitation
for
epa's
consideration
of
proposed
revisions,
and
it's
12
months--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in...
in
the
bill
as
it
now
exists.
and
there
is
another
provision--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
there
is
another
provision
that
relates
to
the
issue
of
this
case,
and
i
will
read
that
sentence
to
the
court.
it
is...
says,
"notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
this
act,
each
provision
of
such
implementation
plan
and
each
permanent
effect
under
such
plan
shall
remain
in
effect
and
shall
be
enforced
under
this
act
until
a
revision
of
such
plan
is
approved
by
the
administrator
or
a
plan
as
promulgated
by
the
administrator
under
subsection
(f).
"
where
he
has
to
promulgate
a
federal
plan.
so,
in
addition
to
the
12-month
requirement,
the
bill,
as
it's
now
pending,
repudiates
the
american
cyanamid
rule
even
in
the
context
of
a
12-month
benchmark.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i...
i'm--
[laughter]
--just
pointing
out
that
congress
is
dealing
with...
with
the
question
explicitly
now,
and
it
perhaps
corroborates
our
point
that
our
interpretation
of
the
present
act
is
not
so
implausible
that
the
courts
would
be
justified
in
reading
into
it
two
provisions
that
are
not
there,
one
a
four-month
requirement
and
the
other
an
enforcement
bar.
since
neither
the
legislative
history
nor
the
text
of
the
act
would
support
the
erection
of
those
requirements
by
the
courts,
the
only
possible
justification
would
be
that
the
act
would
be
so
implausible
without
them
that
the
courts
have
to
feel
themselves
under
a
duty
to
impose
them.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
not...
not
the
first
time.
congress
has
many
responsibilities,
just
as
the
epa
does
and
others
in
the
government
do.
now,
i
want
to
point
out
in
the
very
limited
time
that
i
have
a
very
important
point
made
in
the
massachusetts
brief,
if
i
may,
which
is
footnote
13
on
page
23
of
that
brief,
which
is
the
most
cogent
point
that
has
been
made
in
response
to
the
attempt
to
distinguish
this
court's
decision
in
brock
against
pierce
county
on
the
ground
that
here
the
enforcement
authority
would
be
barred
only
temporarily
and
can
be
regained
after
epa
takes
action
on
the
proposed
revision.
and
massachusetts
and
the
sister
states
point
out
very
properly
that
the
act
applies
to
a
large
variety
of
problems,
including
some
that
endanger
human
health,
such
as
the
carbon-monoxide
problem,
where
hourly
measurements
have
been
required,
that
temporary
suspensions
would
be...
of
enforcement
authority
would
be
an
extreme
misfit
in
this
act
dealing
with
very
serious
problems
of
public
health.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
still
and
all,
we're
talking
about
interpreting
an
act
that
applies
to
a
variety
of
emissions,
some
of
which
are
much
more
serious
in
their
short-term
effects
than
others,
and
mistakes
are
made
in
these
submissions,
and
mistakes
that
can
have
serious
consequences.
the
citizens'
suit
provision
is
another
one
that--
