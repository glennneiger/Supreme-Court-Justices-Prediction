justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
garrett,
the
statute,
does
it
not,
makes
the
terms
of
the
original
plan
enforceable
until
a
revision
is
approved,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
o'connor
well,
of
course,
the
sg
takes
the
position
that
there
is
no
four-month
deadline
requirement
for
action
on
proposed
revisions.
and
i
suppose
you
would
be
first
to
acknowledge
that
the
language
of
the
statutory
provisions
could
be
interpreted
as
the
solicitor
general
suggests,
as
not
requiring
revisions
to
be
approved
within
four
months.
justice
o'connor
well--
justice
o'connor
--but
the...
the
language
of
the
statute
dealing
with
the
four
months
says
the
administrator
shall
within
four
months
after
the
date
required
for
submission
of
a
plan
under
paragraph
1.
now,
that
doesn't
appear
to
refer
to
any
revisions.
justice
o'connor
but
(a)(3)
says
that
the
administrator
will
approve
any
revision
if
he
determines
that
it
meets
the
requirements
of
paragraph
2.
not
that
he
meets
the
requirements
by
acting,
but
that
the
plan
meets
the
requirements.
justice
o'connor
well,
i...
i
guess
my
question
is
specifically
whether
you
would
acknowledge
that
the
language
of
the
statute
could
be
read
as
the
solicitor
general
says
it
should
be
read.
justice
o'connor
but
it
could
be
read
otherwise?
justice
o'connor
no?
justice
o'connor
well,
in
circumstances
as
in
this
case,
who
should
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
revision
meets
the
requirements
and
therefore
has
to
be
approved?
could
that
be
established
as
a
matter
of
defense
by
your
client
if
an
enforcement
action
is
brought
based
on
the
original
plan?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
garrett,
what
language
in
the
statute
would
you
point
to
to
support
that
view
that
that's
a
requirement
and
that
the
epa
may
not
resort
to
enforcement
actions?
is
there
any
particular
provision?
justice
o'connor
well,
they...
they
can
enforce
neither
the
original
plan,
because
there's
a
revision
pending,
nor
the
revised
plan,
because
that
hasn't
yet
been
approved.
so
it's...
it's
just
a
free-for-all
during...
during
the
period
while
the
revision
is
pending.
you
can't
enforce
anything.
all
the
rules
are
gone.
is
that...
is
that
the
regime
that...
that
would
follow?
justice
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
would
you
agree
that
the
epa
is
required
to
act
within
a
reasonable
time
on
proposed
revisions?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
is
a
company
to
do
if
the
epa
does
not
act
on
a
proposed
revision
and
when
the
facts
show
that
the
revision
clearly
meets
the
standards
of
the
act
and
must
be
approved
ultimately?
now,
that's...
that's
the
alleged
position
that
the
petitioner
is
in.
and
whether
or
not
it's
true,
let's
assume
that's
true.
then
should
the
epa
be
able
to,
under
those
circumstances,
continue
to
enforce
the
older
plan?
