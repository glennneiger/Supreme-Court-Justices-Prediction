justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
about
the
interplay
between
the
state
and
the
federal
authority?
if
you
focus
on
section
110(g),
which
provides...
gives
the
governor
the
power
to
suspend
enforcement
if
he
makes
the
finding
that
it's
necessary
to
prevent
the
closing
of
a
plant
and
so
forth.
it
seems
to
me
that
extra
precaution
there
would
be
totally
unnecessary
in
view...
if
your
view
of
the
basic
statutory
scheme
is
correct,
that
the
state
could
accomplish
it
without
that
planning.
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
that
portion.
justice
stevens
no,
but
they
would
then
have
to
at
least
make...
make
the
finding
that
they
approved
the
revision,
just
as
they
do
in
an
ordinary
revision
situation.
justice
stevens
no,
not
the
epa.
i'm
talking
that
the
governor
would,
the
state
would.
justice
stevens
so
why
couldn't...
but
if
they've
done
that,
and
then
your
basic
view
of
the
state
authority
prevailed,
why
would
they
need
to
make
any
other
finding
because
that
in
itself
would
become
the
law
until
epa
acted?
justice
stevens
well,
you
say
it
knew
how
to
draft
it,
but
what
was
it
saying
when
it
talked
about
the
required
four-month
period
in
that
very
section?
justice
stevens
how
good
was
its
draftsmanship?
justice
stevens
which
suggests
to
me
that
you
don't
think
it
was
very
good
draftsmanship.
that's
my
very
point.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
well,
even
if
they're
not
all
adopted
at
the
same
time,
they're
all
part
of
the
same
statute
now.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
they're
only
temporary
enforcement
after
the
state
has
said,
we
think
it's
perfectly
safe
to
do
it.
justice
stevens
so
then
emergency
you're
talking
is
rather
unlikely
to
arise.
