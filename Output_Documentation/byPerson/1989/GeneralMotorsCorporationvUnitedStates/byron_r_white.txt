justice
white
mr.
garrett,
what
is
the...
what
happens
when
an
original
plan
is
submitted
and
the
epa
doesn't
comply
with
the
express
four-month
requirement
for
approval
or
disapproval?
justice
white
does
the
plan
then
become
effective--
justice
white
--just...
just
by
default?
justice
white
but
the
plan
doesn't
automatically
go
into
effect
after
four
months?
justice
white
well,
i
don't
think
your...
i
take
it
your
position
is
that...
that
when
the
revision
is
submitted
and
it
is...
it
is...
say,
it
isn't
approved
or
disapproved
within
four
months
but
finally
it
is
disapproved,
then,
i
take
it,
the
company
has
to
comply
with
the
original
plan
from
there
on.
justice
white
from
there
on?
justice
white
but
you
say
that
they...
until
then
they
may
not
be
fined--
justice
white
--for
their
noncompliance?
justice
white
meanwhile.
justice
white
and
that's
true
even
if
they
act
within
four
months?
suppose
they
act
within
four
months
and
disapprove,
and
you
say
they
nevertheless
may
not
be
fined
for
the...
for
their
noncompliance
with
the
original
plan
up
till
then?
justice
white
well,
that's
your
position
anyway.
justice
white
uh-huh.
justice
white
well,
it
is...
well,
it's
not
unlikely
that
they...
that
they'll
take
longer
than
four
months,
obviously.
and
once
they...
once...
even
though
they
disapprove
and
then
you
have
to
comply
from
then
on
with
the
original
plan,
you
say
they
may
not
fine
you
for
the...
for
the
period
up
until
disapproval?
justice
white
well,
but
that's
not...
that's
not
very
hard,
i
wouldn't
think,
until
the
plan...
until
the
revision
is
approved--
justice
white
--you've
been
under
an
obligation.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
your
position
is
that...
let's
assume
there
was
an
express
four
months
limit
for
a
revision
and
let's
say
that
epa
had
never
exceeded
four
months,
you
say
that...
that
the
company
should
be
able
to
assume
that
the
revision
will
be
approved
at
least
within
that
four-month
period,
because
you...
you
say
you're...
you
just
don't
have...
you're
excused
from
compliance
with
the
original
plan
for...
for
up
till
four
months.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
your
position
is--
justice
white
--but
the
statute
requires
before...
before
a
state
plan
goes
into
effect
originally,
or
a
revision,
the
statute
requires
approval.
justice
white
so
you...
you
say
the...
the
court
of
appeals
didn't...
didn't
go
far
enough?
justice
white
yeah.
you
think
another
court
of
appeals
has
got
the
best
of
it?
what
is
it,
the
fifth
circuit
or--
justice
white
xxx
in
that
regard,
suppose
the
epa
approves
a
revision
and...
but
meanwhile,
obviously,
the...
the...
or,
it
so
happens
that
the
company
has
not
been
living
up
to
the
unrevised
plan,
to
the
original
one,
can
you
then
fine
the
company
for
that
period
up
till
approval
of
the
revision?
justice
white
so
your
answer
to
the
question
is
yes?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
what
do
you
have?
about
three
more
to
go?
justice
white
xxx
national
governors'
association
position?
justice
white
well,
it
doesn't
agree
with
you.
that's
one
problem.
[laughter]
justice
white
yeah?
justice
white
it
wouldn't
make
any...
i...
it
wouldn't...
wouldn't
your
position
be
exactly
the
same
if
there
was
an
express
four
months
provision
for
approval
of
a
plan?
justice
white
so--
justice
white
--exactly.
justice
white
well,
every
court
of
appeals
has
implied
a
four-month
period,
contrary
to
your
view.
justice
white
well,
yes,
but--
justice
white
--your
position--
justice
white
--your
position
remains
the
same
on
enforcement.
justice
white
then,
if
it
does,
i
don't
know
why
you
are...
you
lie
down
for
the
court
of
appeals'
view
that...
that
your
enforcement
power
really
is
limited
by
the
discretion
of
a
judge
to
keep
you
from
fining
this
company
if
it
makes
certain
determinations.
