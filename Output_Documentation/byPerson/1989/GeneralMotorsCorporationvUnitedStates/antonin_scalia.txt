justice
scalia
it
says...
it
says
the
required
period,
what
four-month
period
has
been
required.
justice
scalia
but
that's...
that's
a
required
period
after
the...
the
sips
must
be
submitted.
that
was
four
months
after
the
act
was
originally
passed...
after
the
date
that
the
act
required
states
to
submit
plans.
and
as
the
act
originally
passed,
it
said
four
months
after
that
date
the
administrator
must
have
acted
on
those
plans.
justice
scalia
that
is
the
only
required
four-month
period.
four
months...
not
after
the
plans
were
filed.
the
plans
could
have
been
filed
before
that...
that
period,
couldn't
they?
they
could
have
been
filed
right
after
the
act
was
passed.
so
the
four-month
period
might
indeed
have
been...
i
don't
know
when
the
act
was
passed,
it
might
have
been
an
eight-month
period.
it
was
four
months
after
the
plans
were
required
to
be
filed,
not
four
months
after
they
were
filed.
justice
scalia
it
makes
sense
to
me.
why
isn't
that
true?
justice
scalia
no.
it
just
assumes
that
congress...
that
congress
for
prompt
action
relied
upon
the
administrative
procedure
act
which...
which
assures
prompt
action
in
all
other
areas.
justice
scalia
and
the
four-month
provision
was
just
to
get
this
act
off
and
running
really
fast.
that's
all.
justice
scalia
good.
i
was
going
to
ask
you
what...
what
you
think
that
leads
to.
justice
scalia
the
problem,
mr.
garrett,
is
once
you
abandon
the
form...
well,
you
haven't
abandoned
it.
but
once
you
assume
i
don't
agree
with...
with
your
four-month
clear
line,
industry
isn't
helped
very
much
by
simply
adopting
a
reasonable
time
rule
and
say
that
after
a
reasonable
time
for
approval
has
elapsed
the
industry
is
thereafter
excused
from...
from
complying
with
the
original
sip
and...
and
can
act
as
though
the
revised
sip
has
been
approved.
justice
scalia
reasonable
time
will
vary
enormously
from...
from
one
case
to
another.
the
agency
says
it
goes
from
something
like
three
months
to...
what,
18
at
the
outside?
something
like--
justice
scalia
--no,
i
know
it's
not
your
primary
position.
but...
but
you...
you...
but
you
offered
it
as
a
fallback
position.
that
even
if...
even
if
we
don't
agree
with
your
four-month
clear
line,
still
in
all,
the
agency
had
an
obligation
to
act
within
a
reasonable
time.
and
at
least
after
that
reasonable
time
elapses,
the
same
consequences
should
ensue.
that
is,
that
the
company
should
be
able
to
comply
with
the
revised
plan
rather
than
the
original
plan.
justice
scalia
even
before
the
four
months
expires?
justice
scalia
i
see.
i
see
what
you're
saying.
justice
scalia
oh,
it
would?
it
would?
justice
scalia
you
know,
all...
all
these
revisions
are
not
going
to
be
in
your
client's
favor.
what
if
a
state
adopts...
proposes
a
revised
plan
that
tightens
the
environmental
restrictions?
the
regime
you're
arguing
for
is
that
the
state
can
impose
upon...
upon
industry
those...
those
additional
restrictions
even
though
they
haven't
been
approved
by
epa?
justice
scalia
wow,
that's...
that's
high
risk.
justice
scalia
--it
is...
it
is
the
consequence
of
your
position,
if
i
understand
it,
that
during
the
period
that...
that
a
revision
is
pending
the
federal
government
cannot
enforce
anything?
it
can
neither
enforce
the
old
plan
nor
the
revised
plan.
it
must
rely
entirely
upon
the
states
for...
upon
the
state
for
enforcement?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
of
course,
the
company
here
had
no
real
reason
to
think
that
that
policy
would
apply
because
fairly
early
on,
as
i
recall,
there
was
indication
that
epa
would
oppose
this...
this
revision
anyway.
justice
scalia
in
a
way,
mr.
wallace,
your
position
would
be
better
for
purposes
of
this
case
if
you
didn't
have
that
humane
enforcement
policy.
that
is
to
say,
if
it
was
your
policy
to
go
after
lawbreakers
whether
or
not
the
manner
in
which
they
were
breaking
the
law
was
later
approved,
because
it
seems
to
me
one
of
the
strongest
arguments
that
general
motors
has
here
is
that
your
attitude
towards
the
revision
will...
will
be
affected
by
the
fact
that
you
bring
a
prosecution.
while
the
revision
is
pending,
you...
you
come
into
court
to
prosecute
somebody
for
violating
it,
it's
very
difficult
later
to
say,
yeah,
it
was
a
good
idea
after
all,
they
were
violating
what
was
a
stupid
law
and...
and...
you
know,
you're
not
inclined
to
approve
the
submission.
justice
scalia
now,
that
wouldn't
be
a
problem
if
you
prosecuted
everybody
anyway,
see?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
mr.
wallace,
could
you
explain
to
me
again
what...
what
effect
you
do
give
to...
to
the...
to
the
reference
to
the
required
four-month
period
in
(g)(1)?
what
effect
do
you
give
to
that?
justice
scalia
you
say
that--
justice
scalia
--and
the
suspension
only
lasts
within...
for
four
months?
justice
scalia
(1)(a),
right.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
mr.
wallace,
i'm...
i'm
a
little
surprised
that
the
government
is
so
lackadaisical
about,
you
know,
whether
it's
four
months
or
who
cares
whether
it's
a
four-month
requirement
or
not.
you're
clearly
not
even
trying
to
meet
the
four-month
requirement.
i
mean,
if
it's
a
provision
of
law,
you
should
be
breaking
your
back
to
meet
it.
but
you
come
in
here
and
say,
well,
you
know,
maybe
it's
four
months,
maybe
it
isn't
four
months,
what
do
we
care.
justice
scalia
but
you
said
you're
perfectly
content
to
accept
a
lower
court's
decision
on
that
and
all
the
other
courts
of
appeals
which
have
said
you're
supposed
to
be
acting
within
four
months.
justice
scalia
i
would
think
that
that's...
that's
the
part
of
this
case
you
should
be
most
upset
with.
if
you...
if
i
conveyed
that
impression,
i...
i
did
not
mean
to
convey
that
impression.
we
are
not
content
to
accept
that
reading
of
the
statute.
it
happens
to
be
immaterial
to
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
which
we're
defending,
which
is
that
no
enforcement
bar
should
apply
and
that
the
question
in
the
penalty
phase
is
whether
epa
delayed
unreasonably
in
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case.
the
case,
as
gm
charges...
it
is
really
true
that
epa
is
not
even
trying
to
comply
with
the
four-month
period.
justice
scalia
but...
but,
mr.
wallace,
you
say
it's
not
part
of
the
statute,
but
it
is
a
part
of
the
statute
as
construed
by
several
courts
of
appeals,
which
normally
creates
some
kind
of
a
duty
to
comply.
justice
scalia
no,
you're
not.
you're
not
even
trying
to
do
it
within
four
months.
justice
scalia
you're
not
even
trying.
partly
because
you
know
it
can't
be
done,
but...
but--
[laughter]
justice
scalia
well,
maybe
it's
very--
justice
scalia
--well--
justice
scalia
--is
this
bill
drafted
by
the
same
guy
that
put
in
the
required
four-month
period?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
by
way
of
anticipatory
subsequent
legislative
history?
