justice
kennedy
so...
so
that
it
cannot
be
considered
by
the
jury
as
a
mitigating
factor.
let's
just
get
this
very
clear.
justice
kennedy
in
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical
there
are
three
different
possible
mitigating
factors
that
the
jury
discusses.
each
one
has
one
juror
object
to
it.
as
of
that
point
a
conscientious
jury,
following
the
laws
of
north
carolina,
cannot
consider
any
one
of
those
as
a
mitigating
factor
under
north
carolina
law.
correct?
justice
kennedy
the
problem
with
that
is,
it
seems
to
me,
is
there
really,
as
justice
stevens'
earlier
question
pointed
out,
two
aspects
to
mitigation.
one
is,
did
the
historical
fact
exist.
was
he
drunk?
did
he
have
mental
retardation?
as
to
that,
i
can
see
that
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
by
a
unanimous
jury
may
be
relevant.
but
the
next
question
is
whether
or
not,
as
a
matter
of
judgment,
this
should
bear
on
the
sentence.
and
it
seems
to
me,
that
if
you
require
unanimity
as
to
that
before
any
juror
may
consider
it,
that
you
are
violating
the
rule
we
set
forth
in
mills.
justice
kennedy
well,
of
course
i
was
talking
initially
about
mills.
it...
it
seems
to
me
you
may
be
right,
as
an
abstract
matter,
that
symmetry
is...
is
an
appropriate
goal,
and
that
what
is
fair
for
the
state
is
fair
for
the
defendant.
but
i
think
we
did
not
follow
that
principle
in
mills.
justice
kennedy
but...
but
that
is
your
system,
too.
if
one
juror
says
in
these
circumstances
i
do
not
consider
mental
capacity
to
be
a
mitigating
factor,
the
conscientious
jury
may
not
consider
that
as
mitigating
circumstance.
and
that
is
exactly
what
you've
described.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
was
speaking
in
a
hypothetical
case.
if
one
juror
could
have
prevented
that
from
being
considered
by
all
the
rest
of
the
jurors.
justice
kennedy
counsel,
with
reference
to
justice
white's
last
question,
north
carolina
has
never
contended,
has
it,
that
there
must
be
unanimity
only
as
to
the
historical
fact,
but
that
thereafter
jurors
can
weigh
or
weigh...
not
weigh
on
an
individual
basis.
they've
never
contended
that,
have
they?
justice
kennedy
and
is...
does
the
north
carolina
supreme
court's
decision
explicitly
come
to
grips
with
this
and
say
that
unanimity
is
required
for
both?
