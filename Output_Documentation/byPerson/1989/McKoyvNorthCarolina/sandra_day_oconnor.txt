so,
in
your
view,
if
the
jurors
had
to
be
unanimous
either
to
find
or
to
reject
mitigating
circumstances,
you
would
find
no
objection?
justice
o'connor
and
what
if
they
can't
agree?
then
under
that
system
what
happens?
justice
o'connor
mrs.
byers,
if
the
mills
case
applies
here,
how
do
you
distinguish
the
north
carolina
scheme?
justice
o'connor
what
happens
in
north
carolina
if
one
out
of
12
jurors
finds
no
mitigating
circumstances
proven?
justice
o'connor
so,
that
would
result,
if
there
is
an
aggravating
circumstance,
in
an
instruction
that
tells
the
jury
to
impose
the
death
sentence?
justice
o'connor
and
you
say
that
was
absent
in
maryland.
justice
o'connor
mrs.
byers--
--how
is
your...
excuse
me--
--go
ahead.
well...
what
if
the
jury...
all
the
jurors
think
that
there
is
some
mitigating
circumstance,
but
they
don't
agree
unanimously
on
what
it
is.
they
have
different
reasons.
some
think
age,
some
think
mental
capacity,
some
think
different
things.
now,
under
the
north
carolina
system,
none
of
the
mitigating
evidence
could
be
given
effect
then.
is
that
correct?
justice
o'connor
well,
and
they...
as
i
have
posited
to
you,
that
they
all
find
there
is
some
mitigating
circumstance,
but
they
disagree
on
what
it
would
be.
justice
o'connor
how
do
they
give
effect
to
that
if
they
think
that
the
defendant
should
not
be
given
the
death
penalty?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
there
is
no
mitigating
circumstance
found,
and
there
is
an
aggravating
circumstance
found?
how
are
they
instructed?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
asked
you
what
happened
if
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstances--
justice
o'connor
--found
by
unanimous
jury.
justice
o'connor
yes,
but,
apparently
the
jury
is
instructed
that
if
there
are
no
mitigating
circumstances
and
there
are
aggravating
circumstances,
that
they
still
have
to
determine
whether
those
aggravating
circumstances
are
sufficiently
substantial
to
justify
giving
the
death
penalty.
there
is
another
layer
of
decision.
