mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
the
court
on
certiorari
for
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina
to
review
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina's
decision
affirming
dock
mckoy's
death
sentence.
this
case
is
about
the
penalty
phase
instructions
in
that
trial,
and
whether
those
instructions
violated
the
eighth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
at
the
penalty
phase
trial
in
that
case,
the
court
instructed
the
jury
that
it
must
be
unanimous
to
find
a
mitigating
circumstance,
and
that
if
the
jury
was
not
unanimous
on
a
particular
circumstance
it
should
answer
that
issue
no.
further,
the
court
offered
no
instruction
to
the
jury
at
the
penalty
phase
urging
them
to
try
to
agree
if
there
were
any
disagreements,
initial
disagreements,
about
a
mitigating
circumstance.
thus,
the
question
that
divided
this
court
in
mills
is
not
present
here.
the
state
concedes,
and
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
held,
that
the
instructions
in
this
case
would
require
12
jurors
to
find
mitigation,
but
only
one
to
reject
it.
north
carolina,
after
mills,
is
the
only
jurisdiction
in
the
united
states
where
this
method
of
finding
and
excluding
mitigation
is
still
allowed.
in
mills
this
court
applied
a
well
established
rule.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
well,
maryland
previously
used
this
method,
and--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--i
think
they
were
the
only
ones.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
no,
it
is
not.
it
is
simply
our
position
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to
allow
one
juror
to
preclude
the
rest
of
the
jurors
from
considering
mitigating
circumstances
at...
at
the
penalty,
at
the
final
sentencing
stage.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
i,
frankly,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
i
know
this
court
is
considering
that
question.
we're...
there
is
a
burden
of
proof
in
north
carolina
on
the
defendant.
it
is
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
which
we
have
not
contested
in
this
case.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
we...
we
are
not
disagreeing
in
this
case,
no
sir.
there...
there
is...
was
a
burden
in
this
case,
and
that
is
not
the
subject
of
our
complaint.
our
complaint
is
that...
is
that
that
question
can
be
resolved
by
one
juror
for
the
other
12,
as
it
was
in
mills.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
no,
i
think
it
may
be
addressed
to
the
entire
jury,
your
honor,
but
then
the
entire
jury
has
to
find
that
fact
truly
unanimously.
the...
the
system
that
we
have
here
is...
as
i
understood
the
dissent
in
mills,
for
example,
the...
the
dissenters
in
mills
understood
mills
to
have
a
scheme
where
the
jury
had
to
be
unanimous
to
find
or
to
reject
mitigation.
in
other
words,
they
had
to
agree
about
whether
a
mitigating
fact
either
existed...
it
was
either
true
or
it
was
not
true.
they
had
to
agree.
and
on
that
basis
the
dissenters
felt
that
that
was
a
constitutional
instruction
in
the
constitutional
scheme.
in
the
north
carolina
scheme,
on
the
other
hand,
and
as
i
think
the...
the
court
in
the
mills
decision
held
the
maryland
scheme,
they
interpret
it
to
mean
that
12
jurors
were
required
to
find
that
a
mitigating
circumstance
was
present,
but
only
one
juror
could
upset
that
mitigating
circumstance...
that
is,
to
unfind
it
or
to
reject
that
mitigating
circumstance.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
and
it's
that
one-way
unanimity
that
was
the
problem
in...
in
mills,
i
think,
and
is...
is
clearly,
there
is
no
debate
about
it,
the
problem
in
north
carolina.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
that
is
exactly
right,
i
think,
and
that's--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
it's...
it's
even
handed
in
a
certain
sense,
but
in...
in
one
sense
you're
letting
some
defendants
in
some
trials
get
arbitrary
life
sentences
perhaps
because
the
jury
can...
one
juror
can
reject
aggravation
for
whatever
reason.
it
is
unreviewable.
and
that--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--well,
if
the
state...
i
think
that's
up
to
the
state
as
to
exactly
how
they
found.
the
state
may
decide
that
they
should
be
unanimous,
but
it
should
be
true
unanimity.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
well,
my
complaint,
and...
and
the
complaint
in
mills,
was
not
so
much
about
unanimity.
it
was
about
the
fact
that
it
could
be
rejected
by
one
juror.
in
every
other
way
that
we
consider
unanimity,
unanimity
is
when
everybody
agrees,
that
is
we
all
agree
that
a
fact
is
found
or
we
all
agree
that
a
fact
is
not
found.
that's...
that's
the
problem
in
this
case.
it
was
the
same
problem
that
existed
in
mills.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
well,
if...
if...
if
the
jury...
if
all
12
don't
agree
that
the
appropriate
judgment
is
not
guilty,
then
it
is
a
hung
jury.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--and
again,
our,
your
honor,
our
problem,
the
unconstitutionality
in
north
carolina,
does
not
have
to
do
with
requiring
the
jury
to
be
unanimous
to
find
mitigation.
it
is
allowing
them
to
reject
that
mitigation
by
only
one
juror.
and
i
think
the
examples
that
were
given
in
mills
v.
maryland
really
illustrate
the
problem
that
also
exists
in
north
carolina.
in
mills
v.
maryland
the
two
hypotheticals
that
were
suggested
there
was
that
11
jurors
could
believe
that
there
was
mitigation
in
the
case,
be
convinced
of
it
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
your
honor,
and
yet
one
juror
could
say
i
am
not
convinced
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
further,
those
11
jurors,
if
they
were
allowed
to
consider
that
mitigation,
would
have
found
that
life
was
the
appropriate
decision
in
this
case.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
agree
that
they
can
require
proof
of
a
mitigating
circumstance
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
but
i
don't
agree--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--that's
right.
but
at
that
point...
the
question
is
what
do
you
do
at
that
point
where
there
is
disagreement.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
it
hasn't
been
proved
yet,
and
it
hasn't
been,
i
would
say,
disproved
yet.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
they
haven't
convinced
all
12
at
that
point,
but
they
don't
lose,
your
honor.
in
a...
in
a
criminal
case
where
the
state
has
the
burden,
if
they
convince
11
people
by
a...
by
whatever
the
standard
is,
that
the
defendant
is
guilty,
and
one
doesn't
agree,
the
result
is
not
an
acquittal.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
the
result
is...
is
that
the
defendant
gets
a
new
trial,
there
is
a
hung
jury
or
whatever
happens.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
that
is
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
and
that's--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--it
is
perfectly
parallel,
but
it
is
also
perfectly
arbitrary.
i
think,
and
as
i
was...
i
was
trying
to
answer
this
question
earlier--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--yes,
they
are.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
your
honor,
as...
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
as
to
the
nonstatutory
mitigating
circumstances
which
may
be
considered,
and
also
as
to
the
statutory
mitigating
circumstance
of
age
that
was
submitted
in
this
case,
the
jury
did
have
to
find
two
things.
so
that,
in
this
case,
different
from
mills,
there
are
really
two
layers
of
possible
arbitrary
action
by
the
jury.
all
12
jurors
could
agree
that
a
fact
is
proven...
they...
so
that
the
defendant
has...
has
made
his
burden
of
proof
on
the
question
of
fact,
and
11
of
them
could
find
that
it
is
extremely
mitigating.
and
in
fact,
so
mitigating
that
they
would
impose
a
life
sentence
if
they
could
consider
that
evidence.
but
one
juror
can
find,
in
the
jury
room,
in
secret,
that
that
circumstance,
to
his
mind,
is
not
mitigating.
and
on
that
basis,
the
evidence...
the
jury
has
to
decide
the
case
without
considering
that
evidence.
and
that
can
be
so
even
though
that
12th
juror
might
believe
there
is
some
other
mitigating
circumstance
in
the
case
upon
which
basis
that
juror
would
vote
for
life.
but
because
that
is
not
unanimous,
all
12,
if
they
were
allowed
to
consider
the
mitigation
each
of
the
12
believes,
would
vote
for
life.
but
because
of
the
unanimity
requirement
none
of
them
would
be
able
to
consider
that
mitigation.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--the
difference
is,
your
honor,
is
that
in
this
case
when
jurors
disagree,
the
11
have
to
look
at
the
case
from
that
point
on
through
the
eyes
of...
of
the
one.
that...
that's
the
difference.
if
they
could
disagree
and
then
bring
that
down
to
the
final
sentencing
stage
and
say
well,
we
disagree
as
to
the
basis,
but
we'll
talk
about
it,
and
here
is
what
we
think
the
appropriate
sentence
is
in
the
case,
after
being
directed
through
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstance.
that
is
the
scheme
that
the
vast
majority
of
states,
i
believe,
have.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
only--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--only
if
those
11
decide
to
join
that
one
and
say
yes,
it's
second
degree
murder.
only
if
they
do
that.
now,
if
you
have
a
system
that
requires
the
jury
to
be
unanimous
as
to
all
the
points,
then
there's
going
to
be
give
and
take,
and
one
may
convince
the
other
11.
but
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
a
much
different
case
than
the
case
where
one
can
take
a
position,
he
has
no
duty
or
no
interest
in
trying
to
convince
the
other
11
that
his
position
is
correct.
he
can
just
black
ball,
he
can
just
literally
prevent
them
from
considering
that
mitigation
at
the
sentencing
stage
without
any
convincing.
if
we
had
a
true
unanimity
system
in
north
carolina
then
i
think
it
would
be
like
the
system
that
the
dissenters
approved
in
mills.
but
the
problem
is--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
but
because
north
carolina...
and
i
don't
believe
the
system
for
deciding
aggravation
is
a
reliable
one
either.
because
we
have
a
system
that
in
some
cases
would
allow
one
juror
to
black
ball
aggravation
in
some
cases,
and
therefore
that
defendant
might
get
a
life
sentence
who
doesn't
deserve
it.
i
don't
think
the
cure
for
that
is
to
allow
black
ball
of
mitigation
in
another
case,
in
dock
mckoy's
case,
and...
and
allow
a
defendant
to
get
a
death
sentence
in
a
case
where
it
is
not
appropriate.
you
know,
the...
the
requirement
that
the
jury
be
unanimous
as
to
aggravation
and
the
requirement
that
the
jury
be
unanimous
as
to
mitigation
was
a
decision
that
is
not
in
our
statute;
it
was
a
decision
that
was
made
by
the
north
carolina
supreme
court.
it
is
essentially
judicial
gloss
on
our
statute;
it
is
not
required
by
the
statute.
they...
they
simply
made
the
decision
in
kirkley,
back
in
1983,
that
that
would
be
the
appropriate
way
to
go.
the
problem
with
it,
though,
as
shown
in
mills,
decided
by
this
court,
is
that
it
allows
preclusion
of
mitigation.
it
could
allow
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
despite
the
existence
of
factors
which
would
call
for
a
lesser
penalty.
that
was
exactly
the
problem
that
was
seen
in
mills,
decided
last
term--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--well,
i
think
there
are
problems
with
even
having
a
majority
system,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
you
are
correct.
the
three
things
that
i
think
can
be...
can
be
done--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--is
one,
you
have
true
unanimity.
unanimity
both
ways,
which
is
the
way
the
dissenters
in
mills
interpreted
the
statute
in...
in
maryland.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
there
would
be
no
preclusion
in
that
instance,
because
all...
all
12
jurors,
they
would
have
thought
it
out
and
agreed
as
to
what
was...
whether
a
fact
was
true
or
not.
it
seems
to
me
that
if--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--under
that
system
there
would
be
a
hung
jury,
and
i
should
add
that
in
north
carolina
where
the
jury
can't
agree
the...
the
legislature
has
decided
that
that
defendant
should
get
a
life
sentence.
maryland
also
used
to
have
this
same
statutory
scheme.
they
thought
better
of
it
and
changed
it
so
that
now
in
maryland
if
there
is
a
hung
jury
they
go
back
and
have
another
sentencing
hearing.
if
the
state
is
concerned
about
reliability
and
concerned
to
the
extent
that
they
think
that
unanimity
is
required
for
a
finding
of
mitigating
circumstances,
then
there's
a...
there's
a
certain
cost
to
that,
i
think,
in
efficiency.
there
are
going
to
be
more
hung
juries
if
you
have
true
unanimity.
but
our
point
is
simply
if
it
is
very
important,
for
instance
for
this
jury
to
decide
whether
dock
mckoy
had
a
mental
disturbance
at
the
time
that
this
crime
occurred...
well,
it's
important,
the
jury's
decision
that
that
is
true
is
important,
but
the
jury's
decision
that
that
is
not
true
is
equally
important.
because
what
they
are
deciding
is
not
merely
that
a
burden
has
not
been
met.
they
are
deciding
dock
mckoy's
life
without
consideration
of
any
mental
disturbance
in
the
case.
so
i
think
there
should
be
equal
concern
for
reliability
in
the
decision
that
that
mitigating
circumstance
is
not
present.
it...
it
seems
to
me
all
together
arbitrary
to
allow
one
juror
to
dictate
to
the
other
11
that...
that
fact,
that
question
of
fact,
and
that
all
12
should
either
have
to
agree.
or
there
is
another
suggestion
that
would
be
more
efficient,
and
that
is
to
allow...
continue
to
direct
the
jurors
to
the
mitigating
circumstances,
even
let
the
jurors
vote
on
the
mitigating
circumstances,
but
those
jurors
who
do
not
command
a
unanimous
verdict
on
a
mitigating
circumstance
can
simply
consider
that
in
steps
3
and
4.
in
other
words,
just
simply
allow
those
jurors
to
consider
the
mitigation
that
those
jurors
would
find,
those
11
jurors
would
find,
allow
them
to
consider
it
at
the
final
sentencing
stage.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
you
lose
nothing
in
reliability,
and
in
fact
i
think
that
is
a
more
reliable
determination.
i
think
that
determination
about...
about
the
defendant,
where
11
of
the
12
jurors
agree
on
the
fact,
is
much
more
reliable
than
a
determination
where
only
one
of
12
agree.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
6...
17,
now,
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--that
is...
that
is
really
the
second
layer
of
arbitrariness
that
exists
in
the
north
carolina
system
that
did
not
exist
in...
in
the
maryland
system,
as
least
as
i
read
footnote
8
in...
in
the
mills
decision,
where
all
the
jury
was
deciding
in
the
maryland
case
is...
was
whether
the
fact
was
proven
or
not.
and
if
they
couldn't
agree,
then
it
was...
the
fact
was
out
of
the
case.
but
in
this
case
a
juror
can
do
exactly
what
the
judge
did
in
skipper,
for
example.
he
can
decide
that
some
piece
of
evidence,
some
non
statutory
mitigating
circumstance,
is
not
relevant
in
his
mind.
but
instead
of
being
done
out
in
open
court
where
every,
where
it
will
be
recorded
by
a
trained
judge
and
where
we
can
review
it
and
decide
that
in
fact
that
judge
made
an
error,
all
we
have
is
a...
is
a
jury
sheet
that
says
the
answer
is
no.
we
don't
know
if
it
was
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
or
on
the
basis
of
the
law.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that,
if
anything,
these
jury
sentencing
states,
like
maryland
and
like
north
carolina,
we
should
be
more
careful
with
the
scheme
so
as
not
to
allow
this
sort
of
preclusion,
because
it's
essentially
unreviewable.
if
we
have
a
scheme
that
allows
it,
there
is
no
way
to
prove
it
after
the
fact.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
and
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--no,
the
constitution
does
not
require
it.
i
think,
in
fact,
north
carolina's
system
is
a
lot
more
elaborate
than
it
needs
to
be,
but
elaborate...
being
elaborate
and
being
formal
is
not
the
same
as
being
fair
and
being...
being
more
careful
about
the
defendant's
rights.
and
i
think
the
way
the
north
carolina
system
can
work
is
an
example
of
that
fact.
in
fact,
the
statute
itself
does
not
even
require
any
formal
findings
of
mitigation.
again
that
was
decided
by
our
north
carolina
supreme
court.
you
could
simply
find
an
aggravating
circumstance,
narrow
the
case,
ask
the
jury
to
consider
the
mitigation,
and
then
go
on
and
make
your
ultimate
decisions.
the
problem
with
the
north
carolina--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--that
is
right,
your
honor.
that...
and
that
would
be
one
reason
to
perhaps
have
another
scheme.
but
i
think
a
scheme
that
allowed
the...
either
required
the
jury
to
be
unanimous
all
the
way
or
a
scheme
that
said
where
you
are
not
unanimous,
those
jurors
can
bring
it
down,
it
seems
to
me
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
in
reviewing
the
case
would
be
interested
to
know,
for
example,
that
they
were
11
to
one
in
favor
of
one
mitigator
that
they
didn't
consider.
and
that
they
were
nine
to
three
in
favor
of
another
mitigator
that
they
didn't
consider.
that
would
just
be
additional
information.
so,
if
the
concern
is
for
better
recordkeeping,
then...
then...
then
that
could
certainly
be
accomplished
by--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--i
think
it's
a
question
of
law,
your
honor.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
there
are
some
enumerated
mitigating
factors.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
there
is
no
enclosed
list,
there
are
some
enumerated,
and
then
there
are
additional
nonstatutory
mitigators--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--no,
your
honor--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--the
way
that
maryland
changed
its
sentencing
scheme,
even
before
mills
was
decided,
to
allow...
if
it
is
just
one
juror,
let
that
one
juror
bring
it
down
and
consider
it
in
the
ultimate
sentencing
phase.
and
then
there
would
be
no
exclusion.
in
other
words,
you
don't
have
to
require
unanimity
both
ways,
that
is
not
the
only
way
the
constitution
can
be
satisfied.
another
way
the
constitution
could
be
satisfied
would
be
to
allow
the
jurors
to
vote
on
mitigation,
and
then
those
that
don't
have
a
unanimous
verdict,
those
jurors
can
still
consider
that
mitigation
at
the
ultimate
sentencing
phase.
in
other
words,
it
doesn't...
and
as
i...
as
i
said
to
the
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
that
you
even
have
to
have
formal
findings
of
mitigation
at
all
to
have
a
constitutional
sentencing
scheme,
but
what
you
can't
have,
what
mills
held
last
term
you
can't
have,
is
a
scheme
that
allows
the
preclusion
of
mitigation
by
as
few
as
one
juror
for
all
the
rest.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is...
and
as
the
court
said,
was
the
height
of
arbitrariness.
you
know,
if...
if
we
look
back
at
the
lockett
cases,
if...
if
we're
making
a
decision
as
to
who
is
better
to
make
a
decision
about
whether
a
circumstance
is
mitigating,
for
example,
we
won't
let
a
judge
do
it
for
the...
for
the
jury.
the...
the...
the...
a
single
hold-out
juror,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
worst
possible
person,
if
you
are
thinking
of
all
the
decision
makers.
we
won't
let
the
legislature
do
it.
a
single
hold-out
juror,
it
seems,
is
the
worst
possible
decision
maker
to
be
in
the
position
to
make
that
decision.
if...
if
there
are
no
further
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
thank
you
very
much,
chief
justice.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
no,
they
have
not.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
they
acknowledge
the
fact
that,
as
to
the
nonstatutory
mitigators
and
also
the
statutory
mitigator
of
age,
the
jury
has
to
find
two
things,
as
this
jury
was
explicitly
instructed,
that
it
is
a
fact,
number
one,
and
that
it
is
mitigating,
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
you
will,
number
two.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
well,
i
think
if,
for
instance--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--okay.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
if
11
jurors
believe
he
was
intoxicated,
and
that
it's
an
important
mitigator
and--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--my
answer
is
yes.
my
answer
is
yes,
with
an
explanation,
your
honor,
as
they
say
in
district
court.
my...
your
honor,
if
11
believe
that
he
was
intoxicated
and
that's
important,
and
only
one
believes
that
he
is
not
intoxicated,
i
think
that
it
is
a
less
reliable
and
more
arbitrary
to
decide
the
case
as
if
the
defendant
were
not
intoxicated.
if
i
have
to
choose
between
how
that
fact
is
going
to
be
decided
in
that
case,
i
think
if
we
decide
on
the
basis
of
the
one
juror's
vote
instead
of
the
11,
that
is
less
reliable.
so,
my
answer
is
yes.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
if
11
believe
that
the...
the
defendant's
age
is
mitigating,
and
only
one
doesn't--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--i
would
still...
i
think
that's
what
was
held
in...
in
mills,
your
honor,
that
allowing
one
juror
to
decide
for
the
11...
other
11...
because
in
mills,
this
second
level
was
not
there.
in
mills
they
were
only
finding
facts.
the
jury
was
only
finding
facts--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--yes.
and
this
court
held,
in...
in
mills,
that
that
was
the
height
of
arbitrariness,
to
let
one
person
essentially
veto
facts
for
the
others.
i
did
want
to--
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
--well,
i
would
say...
my
personal
belief
is
no,
that
still
wouldn't
be
constitutional,
because
they
could
be
preclusion,
but
it
is
seven
times
less
arbitrary
than
the
system
we
have
in
north
carolina
now.
as
to
the
question
about
what
the
jury
does
with
question
4,
justice,
i
wanted
to
be
sure
and
point
out
that
in
north
carolina
it
is
very
clear
in
question
4
the
only
thing
that
jury
can
consider
is
the
mitigating
circumstances
that
were
found,
not
the
whole
case.
they
are
not
doing
a...
a
review
of
the
entire
case.
on
page
73
of
the
joint
appendix,
at
the
top
of
the
page,
the
north
carolina
supreme
court
says
it
then
allows
the
jury
to
consider
only
that
evidence
which
is
relevant,
which
in
north
carolina's
definition
of
the
word
is
that
evidence
which
the
jury
has
unanimously
found,
in
sentencing
the
defendant.
mr.
malcolm
ray
hunter,
jr.
that
is
true.
there
is
another
layer,
but
it
is
only
a
reconsideration
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
that
were
found,
plus
if
any
mitigating
circumstances
were
found,
consideration
of
those.
this
court
has
never
held
that
because
we
are
very
solicitous
about
the
consideration
of
aggravation,
for
instance
in
sumner
and
roberts
are
two
cases
that...
that
occur
to
me,
we
have
never
held
that
because,
no
matter
how
narrowly
we...
we...
we
treat
aggravation,
that
that
excuses
the
exclusion
of
mitigating
evidence.
that's,
i
think,
the
lockett
doctrine
which
was
violated
in
mills,
your
honor,
and
again
in
this
case.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
