justice
stevens
so
that
if
the
fact
is
proved,
there
is
no
issue
about
whether
it
was
aggravating.
but
in
the
mitigating
circumstance
category
there
are
two
things
the
defendant
must
prove:
one,
that
the
fact
exists,
and,
two,
that
it
is
mitigating.
so
they
are
not
parallel.
justice
stevens
mr.
hunter,
you
keep
emphasizing
agree
on
the
fact.
but
am
i
not
correct
that,
say...
how...
how
young...
what
is
the
youngest
age
at
which
a
person
can
be
executed
in
north
carolina?
justice
stevens
well,
supposing
there
is
uncontradicted
evidence
that
the
defendant
was
17
years
old,
and
all
12
agree
to
that
fact,
and
one
of
the
12
says
that
may
be
true,
but
i
don't
think
that
is
any
mitigation.
i
think
a
17-year
old
should
be
treated
the
same
as
a
30-year
old,
so
i
don't
consider
it
mitigating.
now
that
means,
as
i
understand
it,
the
other
11
may
not
treat
it
as
mitigating.
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
is
much
more
significant
than
the
question
of
whether
they
disagree
on
whether
he
is
17
or
not.
justice
stevens
mr.
hunter,
do
you
think
that
the
question
whether
an
age
of
16
is
a
mitigating
factor
or
not
is
a
question
of
law
or
a
question
of
fact?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
tell
me,
what
if...
what
if...
i
mean,
we're
dealing
with
a
situation
where
there
are
no
enumerated
mitigating
factors
in
the
law,
right?
justice
stevens
may
i
question
you
a
moment
about
the
distinction,
because,
supposing
you
have
a
case
in
which
if
you
just
look
at
the
aggravating
side
you
feel
quite
confident
the
jury
would
say
this
is
a
sufficiently
serious
crime
that
it
justifies
the
death
penalty.
but
if
the
jury
were
to
consider
the
fact
that
the
defendant
was
16
years
old
and
had
military
service,
say...
or
maybe
he
couldn't
do
that
if
he
was
just
16...
but
say
two
or
three
factors
like
that,
and...
and
if
they
were
in
the
balance
there
would
be
great
doubt
about
whether
there
would,
the
aggravating
would
outweigh
the
mitigating.
in
such
a
case,
as
i
understand
it,
if
one
juror
agrees
that
the
facts
exists
but
the...
thinks
they
have
no
mitigating
significance,
that
juror
can
require
the
others
not
to
consider
them,
and
therefore
requires
the
death
penalty
be
imposed.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
i
am
assuming
you
satisfy
issue
four
if
you
don't
consider
mitigating
circumstances.
justice
stevens
but
that
is
not
sufficient
if
they
were
to
consider
youth,
military
service,
the
fact
he
was
intoxicated,
three
or
four
things
like
that,
but
one
juror
says
i
don't
care
about
those
things,
i
don't
consider
it
mitigating,
even
though
i
agree
all
those
facts
are
correct.
that
juror
will
therefore
cause
the
death
penalty
to
be
imposed,
if
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
age
is
one
of
them.
justice
stevens
well,
you
always
have
some
age.
you
always
have
some
age.
and
a
juror
can
say
i
don't
think
that
age
is
mitigating.
you
don't
always
get
mitigating...
maybe
he's
35
years
old.
justice
stevens
and
everybody
agrees
on
his
age...
but
the
only
issue
is
whether
that
age
is
a
mitigating
factor
or
not.
justice
stevens
well,
suppose
the
significant,
no
significant
past...
criminal
history.
supposing
he
has
three
speeding
tickets.
one
juror
could
say
that
is
significant.
the
other
11
could
say
that
is
silly;
that's
not
significant.
but
if
one
thinks
it
is
significant,
that
cannot
be
counted
as
a
mitigating
circumstance.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
on
the
mitigating
side,
the
lockett
case
imposes
a
duty
on
the
state
to
allow
its
jurors
to
consider
all
mitigating
circumstances.
and
how
can
you
reconcile
that
case
with
a
system
which
allows
one
juror
to
say
age
and
significant
history
and
so
forth
can't
be
considered?
justice
stevens
you
have
to
use
the
words
may
not
consider.
it
says
the
jury
must
be
able
to
consider
it.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
ask
you
one
question
there.
you
say
you
have
the
same
result
in
every
county
in
every
trial.
in
this
case,
the
defendant
was
65
and
he
asked
the
jury
to
find
that
was
mitigating,
and
they
didn't,
so
65
is
not
a
mitigating
circumstance
in
this
trial.
is
it
not
possible
that
another
65-year
old
defendant,
in
another
county,
might
persuade
the
jury
that
that's
mitigating?
justice
stevens
no,
but
i'm
just
saying
it's
possible,
is
it
not?
justice
stevens
and
it
would
not
violate
any
north
carolina
rule.
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
the
fact
that
this
jury
so
found
in
this
case
will
have
any
impact
whatsoever
on
another
trial.
the
other
jury
won't
even
know
about
this
one,
will
it?
justice
stevens
well,
the
standard,
as
i
understand
it,
is
if
one
juror
thinks
it
is
not
mitigating,
it
is
not
mitigating.
that
is
the
standard.
justice
stevens
that's
right.
he...
he
only
convinced
11
of
them,
but
he
might
convince
12
in
the
next
case.
that
is
what,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
this
enhances
uniformity.
under
your
system,
as
i
understand
it,
the
defendant
would
have
to
convince
all
12
that...
that
a
bizarre
factor
like
the
fact
that
he
is
65,
or
60,
or
53,
is
mitigating.
