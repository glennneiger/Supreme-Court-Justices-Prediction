justice
scalia
excuse
me,
what...
what
do
you
mean
is
still
allowed?
did
some
states
previously
use
this
method?
justice
scalia
well,
maybe,
right.
justice
scalia
one...
one
could--
justice
scalia
--of
course,
one...
one
could
upset
an
aggravating
circumstance
in
north
carolina
as
well,
couldn't
it?
justice
scalia
so
why
isn't
that
even
handed
enough?
justice
scalia
you
think
that
is
bad
too.
you
think
maybe...
maybe
aggravating
circumstances
should
just
be
majority...
majority
vote.
justice
scalia
hung
jury.
well,
if
they
convince
11
that
there
are
aggravating
circumstance
and
they
don't
convince
one
that
there
is
an
aggravating
circumstance,
they
haven't
carried
their
burden,
and
the
result
in
north
carolina
is
that
the
defendant
cannot
be
given
death.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
he
gets
a
life
sentence
instead.
justice
scalia
so
this
is
perfectly
parallel.
justice
scalia
or
is
it
perfectly
parallel?
let
me
interrupt
there
a
minute.
in
the
aggravating
circumstance
category,
the
aggravating
circumstances
are
statutorily
defined,
are
they
not?
justice
scalia
this
happens
all
the
time
with
respect
to
subissues
that
are...
that...
that
are
within
one
major
issue.
even
on
the
issue
of
guilt.
you
might
have...
you
might
have
11
jurors
who
believe
that...
that
the
defendant
was
there
at...
the
scene,
one
who
doesn't
believe
he
was
at
the
scene.
perhaps
all
12
believe
that
if
he
was
at
the
scene
he
pulled
the
trigger.
you...
you
have
an
odd
result,
since
only...
they
all
believe
he
pulled
the
trigger,
since
only
one
of
them
believed
he
wasn't
there,
even
the
one
that...
every...
everybody's
vote
is...
is
distorted
when
you
have
subissues
like
this.
that
happens
all
the
time.
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
why
this
is
such...
such
an
extraordinary
thing.
justice
scalia
but...
but
very
often,
if...
if
you
need
one
additional
element
for
first
degree
murder,
for
example,
only
one
juror
believes
that
that
element
does
not
exist,
all
of
the
other
11
therefore
have
to
regard
the
rest
of
the
case
as
a
second
degree
case--
justice
scalia
--and
proceed
on
that
basis.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
but
that...
that
argument
would
apply
to
aggravating
circumstances
as
well,
necessarily.
justice
scalia
now,
how...
how
would
a
majority
vote
solve
this
problem?
i
mean,
you...
you
could
still
have
the
same
kind
of
extortion
on
the
part
of
one
juror
if
you...
if
you
say
only
a
majority
has
to
find
both
aggravation
and
mitigation,
and
the
jury
is
split
six-six.
what
incentive
is
there
for
any
of
the
six
to
change
their
mind?
they...
they
know
that
if
they
don't
change
their
mind
there
is
no
aggravation
found.
justice
scalia
we
can't
run
a
legal
system;
there
are
problems
with
everything.
justice
scalia
right.
and
perhaps
constitutionally
there
can't
be
a
closed
list
of
mitigating
factors.
justice
scalia
and
you
expect
a
jury
to
be
unanimous
in...
some
cases,
that
in
the
whole
scope
of
whatever
might
be
considered
mitigating
by
anybody
in
the
world,
none
exists
in
this
case.
that
is
the
kind
of
unanimity
factor
you
think
the
constitution
requires
the
jury
in
north
carolina
to
be
asked.
justice
scalia
all
it
takes
is
one
juror
who
thinks
that...
that
one
thing...
i
don't
know...
one
thing
is
a
mitigating
factor
which
nobody
else
in
the
world
conceives
of.
justice
scalia
he
possibly
could,
but
he
would
have
to
convince
all
12.
justice
scalia
whereas
under
the
system
urged
by...
by
the
petitioner
here,
if
he
convinces
just
one
that
the
fact
that
he
is
53
should
be
mitigating,
that
alone
will
justify
that
juror
in
using
that
factor
to
prevent
the
others
from
imposing
the
death
penalty.
justice
scalia
and
your
point
is
that
that
seems
much
more
bizarre.
