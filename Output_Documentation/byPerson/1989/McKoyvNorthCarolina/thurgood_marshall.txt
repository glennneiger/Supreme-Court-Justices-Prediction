ms.
byers,--
justice
marshall
--is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
show
that
this
juror
did
give
reasons?
justice
marshall
the
juror
that
wouldn't
go
along.
justice
marshall
is
there
any
way
of
having
that
known?
justice
marshall
of
course
not.
justice
marshall
would
you
have
a
problem
if
a
juror,
when
he
walked
into
jury
room,
said
i
am
not
going
on
this
mitigating
business?
is
there
anything
you
could
do
about
that?
justice
marshall
is
there
anything
anybody
could
do
about
that
in
north
carolina?
justice
marshall
well,
if
a
juror
violates
his
oath,
what
can
you
do
about
it,
if
he
does
it
in
the
jury
room?
justice
marshall
wait
a
minute.
then
you
agree
that
if
one
juror,
one
juror
can
stop
that
mitigating
evidence
without
giving
a
reason.
justice
marshall
well,
why
do
you
need
the
word
theoretical?
give
me
a
reason
where
they
can.
