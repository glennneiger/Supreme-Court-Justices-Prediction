h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
88-5909,
dock
mckoy,
jr.
v.
north
carolina.
mr.
hunter.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
hunter,
is
it
your
position
that
the
constitution
requires
the
state
to
prove
lack
of
mitigating
circumstances?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
do
feel
that
the
state
may
say
to
the
defendant,
you
bear
the
burden
as
to
the
existence
of
mitigating
circumstances?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
don't...
you
don't
disagree
with,
at
least
in
your
position
here,
that
north
carolina
may
place
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
defendant
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
to
show
mitigating
circumstance?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
it...
it
does
seem
to
me,
perhaps
i
am
wrong,
that
there
is
a
certain
inconsistency
if
you
say
that
the
state
may
place
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
prove
it,
but...
but
then
you
say
the
question
should
be
addressed
to
each
juror.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
so
the
party
that
carries
the
burden
of
the
proof
loses
at
that...
the
party
that
has
to
carry
the
burden
of
proof
ordinarily
we
would
say
loses
at
that
point.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
constitution
requires
that
it
be
a
set
of
questions
and
answers,
rather
than
a
judge's
charge
to
the
jury
outlining
the
steps
they
should
go
through,
and
then
just
a
verdict
of
death
or
life?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
no
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you
had
a
system
without
any
findings,
where
the
judge
just
charged
on
all
the
points
and
the
jury
came
back
with
a
simple
verdict
of
either
death
or
life,
you...
wouldn't
have
the
basis
for
review
that
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
hunter.
mrs.
byers.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
byers.
mr.
hunter,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
it
comes
out
seven
to
five?
are
you...
are
you
going
to
let
seven
people
veto
facts
for
the
other
five?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hunter.
the
case
is
submitted.
