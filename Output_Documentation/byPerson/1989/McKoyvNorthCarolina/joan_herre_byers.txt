mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
here,
as
in
several
other
cases
now
before
this
court,
deals
with
the
state's
right
to
have
a
sentencer
rationally
assess
evidence,
or
plead
for
life
sentence
instead
of
death.
mckoy
versus
north
carolina
specifically
involves
whether
a
state
may
hold
the
defendant
to
a
burden
of
proving
his
mitigation
with
a
reasonable
certainty
to
the
entire
sentencing
body,
the
jury.
in
north
carolina,
just
as
aggravating
factors
must
be
found
by
all
jurors
or
they
are
considered
not
to
exist,
north
carolina
has
made
the
policy
determination
to
have
symmetry,
so
that
likewise
the
mitigation
must
be
found
by
all
jurors,
or
it
likewise
does
not
exist.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
justice
o'connor,
i
do
not
read
the
mills
case
as
holding
that
this
type
of
system
is
per
se
bad.
i
understood
mills
to
be
concerned
with
the
issue
of
ambiguous
jury
instructions
in
a
very
different
system,
a
system
where
the
no
vote
by
one
juror
on
mitigation
could
force
a
death
penalty
without
any
kind
of
further
consideration
of
the
appropriateness
of
the
death
penalty
by
the
rest
of
the
jury.
this
is
not
present
in
north
carolina.
one
juror
in
north
carolina
can,
at
best,
say
that
mitigation...
that...
that...
that
juror
does
not
find
that
mitigation
exists
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
one
juror
in
north
carolina
cannot
mandate
a
death
sentence.
i
think
that
is
a
significant
difference,
because
just
as
there
is
no
one
way
to
reach--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--if
one
juror,
pursuant
to
their
instructions,
finds
that
the
evidence
does
not
rise
to
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
after
deliberation
does
not,
cannot
agree,
then
the
mitigation
is
deemed
insufficiently
reliably
proved
and
does
not
exist.
however,
that--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--no,
justice
o'connor.
there
is
yet
one
more
step,
where
the
jury
must
determine
unanimously
and
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
the
aggravating
factor
found
by
the
jury...
or
factors
found
by
the
jury
to
exist,
is
sufficiently
substantial
to
warrant
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
in
this
case.
so
the
jury
still
has
that
vehicle
through
which
to
give
their
reasoned,
moral
response,
and
determine
whether
or
not,
given
the
substantiality
of
the
aggravating
factor,
death
is
in
fact
appropriate
in
this
case.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
yes,
in
maryland
the
failure
to
find
mitigation
mechanistically
forces
a
sentence
of
death.
the
jury
cannot
even
vote
about
whether
they
consider
the
aggravating
sufficiently
substantial.
in
maryland
the
statute
ends
with
the
weighing
process
and
does
not
go
on
to
that
fourth
step.
north
carolina
is
unique,
or
almost
unique,
among
the
states
in
having
this
type
of
step.
therefore,
we
feel
that
this
kind
of
burden
of
proof
does
not
raise
any
of
the
dangers
of
arbitrariness
which
possibly
could
have
resulted
from
a
maryland
burden
of
proof
of
this
type.
so,
for
that
reason
alone
we
find
it,
a
difference.
further,
north
carolina,
as
a
matter
of
state
policy
unlike
maryland,
has
determined,
as
a
matter
of
our
state
law,
that
evidence
ceases
to
be
used
in
the
balancing
process
once
it
is
found
insufficiently
reliable
to
support
a
mitigating
factor.
and,
as
justice
blackmun
noted
in
footnote
7,
the
maryland
court
had
taken
the
opposite
tack
on
that,
so
we
say
that
this
is
another
state
law
rule
which
does
distinguish
these
cases.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
well,
again,
no,
your
honor.
we
have
a
specific...
an
absolutely
specific
statutory
instruction
in
our
issue
4.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
oh,
okay.
i
apologize.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
no,
you
do
not
understand
our
system
totally
correctly,
then,
sir.
justice
stevens,
the
north
carolina
statute
sets
out
eight
specific
mitigating
factors,
much
like
maryland
did.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
and...
age
is
one
of
them.
and
if
they
are
found
to
exist,
they
must
be
given
mitigating
effect,
that
is--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--well--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--that
is
probably
the
only
one
of
the
statutory
mitigating
circumstances
where
we
could
even
talk
about
the--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--that's
correct,
but
again
it
is
an
issue
of
a
burden
of
persuasion
and
the
defendant
has
not
reached
it,
and
he
carries
it,
just
as
we
carry
the
burden
of
proving
that
aggravating
factors
exist
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
to
all
12
of
the
jurors,
or
they
don't
exist.
and
again,
here
we
also
have
the
same
kind
of
line
drawing
you
have
in
mitigation,
because
we
have
the
especially
heinous,
atrocious
or
cruel
aggravating
circumstance
which
also
brings
into...
to
bear
a
mixed
issue
of
fact
and...
and
law.
so,
this
is
not
just
on
the
mitigating
side,
necessarily,
where
these...
these
lines
are
drawn.
likewise--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--if
it
please
the
court,
i
believe
this
is
not
a
lockett
problem.
lockett,
eddings,
hitchcock,
skipper,
penry,
all
deal
with
exclusion
of
types
of
evidence
or
limitation
on
the
ability
to
give
the
proved
mitigation
full
effect.
that
is
not
what
we
have
here.
we
are
simply
dealing
with
a
vehicle
by
which
this
mitigation
is
proved.
we
do
not
in
any
way
in
north
carolina
limit
what
the
jury
can
hear,
what
can
be
put
in
beyond
the...
the
wildest
realm
of
just
the
ordinary
evidentiary
requirements.
the
only
thing
that
north
carolina
does,
and
we
believe
properly
does,
is
we
require
the
defendant
to
prove
his
mitigating
factors
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
whole
jury
so
that
we
can
have
an
understanding
and
a
belief
that
the
evidence
in
mitigation,
like
the
aggravation
in
aggravation,
is
reliably
proven.
and
we
believe
this
is
different
from
lockett.
lockett
dealt
with
a
jury
not
being
allowed
to
hear
certain
types
of
evidence
or
give
any
consideration
to
types
of
evidence.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
there
is
full
consideration
with
our
jury.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
i
would...
well,
obviously,
under
the
north
carolina
system,
all
must
agree
as
to
the
presence
of
the
various
ones.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
under
those--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--well,
again,
justice
o'connor,
the
sentencer
here
is
the
jury,
not
the
jurors.
and
if
the
entire
jury
is
not
convinced
of
these
factors
in
mitigation,
then
it
ought
not
use
them
in
its
weighing
and
balancing
process.
now,
the--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--it...
it--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--that
is
correct,
because,
again,
there
was
full
consideration
of
the
evidence
which
supports
these
factors,
and
if
the
defendant
has
not
carried
his
burden
of
proving
these
factors
to
this
jury,
then
it
ought
not
use
them
in
the
balancing
against
those
aggravating
factors
which--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--again,
your
honor,
i
would
come
back
with
the
fact
that
the...
it's
not
each
juror;
it
is
the
jury
that
is
the
sentencer.
and
we
put
the
same
type
of
burden,
in
fact
more
heinous
burden,
on
the
state
to
prove
the
aggravation,
which
also
calls
into
question
not
only
historical
facts,
but
judgments.
and
if
we
are
going
to
have
symmetry,
if
we're
going
to
have
balancing
where
the
sentencers
are
balancing
off
the
same
sheet,
or
using
the
same
factors,
then
we
have
to
have
this
type
of
rule.
and,
again,
we
believe
that
we
have
not
violated
lockett
because
there
is
full
consideration--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--and,
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
suggest
that...
that
mills
did
not
go
that
far.
and
further,
i
think
one
of
the
problems
in
mills
was
that,
unlike
north
carolina,
the
danger
of
having
an
otherwise
reasonable
burden
of
proof
is
that
suddenly
the
jury
was
faced
with
a
fact
where
the
decision
was
taken
entirely
out
of
their
hands
and
they
could
not
give
any
type
of...
reasoned
approach,
or
discretion,
to
giving
the
death
penalty.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
no...
no...
that...
that
is
not
correct,
justice
kennedy.
if
that
factor,
if
a
mental
capacity
is
found,
it
is
one
of
our
statutory
mitigating
factors,
and
it
must
be
given
effect.
and
in
fact,
it
was
given
in...
effect
in
this
case
under
the
capacity
to
appreciate
the
criminality
if
his
conduct
was
impaired.
so,
again,
as
to
the
statutory
mitigating
factors,
it...
it
was
given
full
effect
here.
the--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--yes,
that's
true.
but,
by
the
same
token,
one
juror
can
force
the
aggravating
factors
not
to
be
found.
we
must
prove
it
to
all
jurors
unanimously
and
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
or
those
factors
do
not
exist.
mitigating
factors,
the
defendant
merely
carries
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
that
is
hardly
an
onerous
standard.
then...
and
then
we
go
to
the
balancing.
if
all
12
do
not
agree
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
mitigating
factors
found
are
insufficient
to
outweigh
the
aggravating
factors
found,
again,
a...
a
life
sentence
is
forced
by
that
one
juror.
indeed,
at
the
balancing
stage
there
is
a
presumption
of
life,
since
it
goes
to
the
state
to
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the...
that
the
aggravating
factors
really
do
outweigh
that...
that
mitigation.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
then
we
go
to...
then
we
go
to
issue
4
of
the
instructions,
and
on
page
14
of
the
joint
appendix,
or
page
14
and
15
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
jury
is
told
to
"unanimously
find
beyond
reasonable
doubt
that
the
aggravating
circumstance
found
by
you
is
or
are
sufficiently
substantial
to
call
for
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
"
and
again,
they
are
to
look
at
this
in
light
of
the
case.
they
are
to
find
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
they're
told
an
aggravating...
circumstance,
may
exist
in
a
particular
case
and
still
not
be
sufficiently
substantial
to
call
for
the
death
penalty.
therefore,
it
is
not
enough
for
the
state
to
prove
from
the
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
existence
of
one
or
more
aggravating
circumstances.
it
must
still...
also
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--and
when
there
are
no
mitigating
circumstances--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--then...
then
the
jury
still
must
determine
in
that
fourth
issue
whether
the
aggravating
factors
found
are
sufficiently
substantial
to
warrant
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
and
they
are
specifically
told
the
mere
fact
of
finding
an
aggravating
factor
does
not
mandate
death.
they
still
have
to
find
that
death
is
deserved
in
this
case.
and
they
look
at
it
in
light
of
the
case,
and
not
in
light
of...
you
know,
in
any
kind
of
abstract
form.
they
don't
just
say
heinous,
atrocious
or
cruel;
that
sounds
bad
to
me,
therefore
death.
they
are
to
look
at
it
under
the
facts
of
that
case
and
in
light
of
the
case.
the...
as...
as
i
said,
the
burden
of
proof
that
we
place
upon
the
defendants
to
prove
their
mitigation
is
not
onerous.
and
it's
an
easy
one,
it
is
one
traditionally
placed
on
defendants
to
prove
matters,
particularly
within
their
own
knowledge.
it
is
suggested
that
there
is
a
hold-out
juror;
this
has
been
the
hypotheticals.
there
clearly
was
no
hold-out
juror
here,
since
two
matters
in
mitigation
were
found
unanimously.
so,
the
issue
of
the
hold-out
juror
precluding
all
mitigation
and
forcing
a
death
sentence
simply
does
not
exist
in
this
case.
further,
the...
i
think
what
this
court
needs
to
look
at
is
the
risk
of
arbitrary
action.
and
in
looking
at
that,
your
other
cases
would
suggest
that
the
danger
of
the
hold-out
juror
is
more
illusory
than
real.
this
court,
in
johnson
v.
louisiana
and
several
other
cases,
have
looked
to
the
fact
that
jurors
take
the
responsibility
seriously
and
deliberate
together.
there
is...
so
there
is
no
real
issue
of
one
not
listening
to
the
12,
or
we
certainly
can't
assume
that
on
a...
on
an
empty
record
such
as
this.
further,
through
the...
through
the
use
of
voir
dire,
cause
and
preemptories,
full
instructions
on
the
burdens
and
how
to
find
the
individual
factors
in
mitigation,
reminders
to
the
jury
to
deliberate
together,
something
which
was
done
in
this
case,--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--yes.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
that
the...
that
the
jury
gave
reasons?
ms.
joan
herre
byers
there...
there's
no
showing
in
this...
record
that
there
was
a
juror
that
wouldn't
go
along.
there
is
no
showing
at
all
that
there
was
any
problem
whatsoever.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
well--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--i
would...
i
would
not
be
sure,
your
honor.
i
would
think
that
if
there
is
a
substantial
problem
within
the
jury
that
there
would
start
being
notes
coming
out--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--well,
there's
nothing,
of
course,
that
i
can
do
about
that,
except--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--well,
yes,
sir.
the
other
12...
the
other
11
could
refuse
to
go
along
with
the
rest
of
the
process.
i
think
that
we
can't
presume
that
we
have
this
type
of
arbitrary
jury
action.
jurors
are
assumed
to
follow
their
oaths,
and
part
of
the
requirement--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--you
can
do
nothing
about
it
in
the
jury
room
if
someone
violates
their
oath,
but
i
would...
i
would
think
that
this
court
has--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--one
juror...
theoretically
one
juror
could
stop
mitigating
evidence
without
giving
a
reason,
but
i
think
that
it
takes--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--well,
when
i
say
theoretically,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
dynamics
of
the
jury
system
suggest
that
that
is
simply
not
the
way
jurors
behave,
and
i
believe
that
this
court
has
written
a
series
of
opinions
that
say
that
the
jurors
are
presumed
to
follow
their
oaths,
and
are
presumed
to
act
in
a
responsible
manner,
johnson
v.
louisiana,
and
the
oregon
case
that
i
can't
pronounce
the
first
name
of.
the...
but
again,
you
have
so
many
issues
along
the
way
to
winnow
out
those
irresponsible
jurors.
you
have
the
use
of
wide-ranging
voir
dire,
which
was
done
in
this
case.
all
jurors
agreed
that
they
could
understand
and
give
attention
to
ideas
of...
of
mental
problems.
if...
you
get
full
instructions
on
how
they
are
to
behave.
and
indeed,
this
case,
i
think,
your
honor,
exemplifies
the
remoteness
of
the
concern
you
brought
out,
because
here
two
factors
were
found.
so
they
were
clearly
no
hold-out
jurors.
the
state
has
a
significant
stake
in
having
the
type
of
line-drawing
that
we
have
in
this
case,
and
one
of
the
things
that
is
important
to
our
system
are...
and
promotes
its
rationality,
is
we
have
a
searching
proportionality
review,
and
the
listing
of
this
mitigating
evidence
helps
us
with
this
proportionality
review.
our
court
looks
not
only
to
the
aggravating
factors
found
in
determining
whether
this
is
a
proportionate
sentence,
but
they
also
look
to
all
of
the
issues
found
in
mitigation.
indeed,
this
is
probably
why
they
started
urging
us
to
keep
these
findings,
so
that
they
could
look
to
the
cases
where
life
was
found,
as
well
as
the
cases
where
death
was
returned,
to
ensure
that
this
case
fell
within
that
core
of
cases,
more
appropriately
life
or
more
appropriately
death.
the
issue
of
unanimity
is
important
because
burdens
on
the
defendant,
as
well
as
on
the
state,
tend
to
force
the
jury
at
both
places
to
follow
channeling,
follow
reliable
standards.
so
that...
so
that
those
people
who
get
life,
and
those
people
who
get
death,
get
that
in
accordance
with
rules,
as
opposed
to
a
free-floating
whimsy.
the
failure
to
allow
the
state
to
allow
burdens
of
proof
will...
in
mitigation
as
well
as
aggravation,
will
really
open
one
end
of
the
sentencing
equation
to
complete
open-endedness,
complete...
complete
arbitrary...
it...
what
could
be
complete
arbitrariness.
the
eighth
amendment
has
never
said
that
its
goal
was
the
minimum
number
of
death
sentences
possible,
but
rather,
to
the
extent
we
can,
the
issues
that
we're
trying
to
deal
with
by
these
sentences...
by
these...
these
evidentiary
rules,
are
to
ensure
that
one
person
doesn't
get
the
death
penalty
on
the
same
basis
that
another
person
would,
trying
to
bring
rationality
into
the
system.
the
jury,
after
hearing
an
individual's
evidence,
by
having
this...
this
standard,
and
if
we
are
going
to
have
aggravation
found
by
this
standard,
the
need
for
symmetry
is
such
that
we
do
need
this
type
of
rule,
the
jury,
after
hearing
an
individual's
evidence,
will
have
a
standard
to
follow
in
assessing
the
evidence's
believability.
and
so
while
each
jury
of
necessity
will
hear
the
different
evidence
that
each
defendant
presents,
the...
the
uniqueness
of
his
circumstances
which
he
brings
forth
in...
in
suggestion
of
a
sentence
less
than
death.
nevertheless,
we
have
in
north
carolina,
a...
a
belief
and
an
appreciation
that
jury
to
jury,
county
to
county,
defendant
to
defendant,
the
same
standards
are
being
used.
this
reliability,
this
rationality
in
the
process,
the
systemwide
rationality
is
a
very
important
thing
to
the
north
carolina
jury
system.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
i
know
of
no
case
where
a
65-year
old
has
convinced
them
that
that
is--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--it's
possible--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--it
would
not
violate
any
north
carolina
rule,
but
again,
giving
these
types
of
standards
to
the
jury
in
finding
these
mitigating
factors
helps
eliminate
the
arbitrariness
inherent
in
having
different
juries
determining
different
cases.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
well,
no,
they
won't.
but
again,
they'll
be
using
the
same
mechanisms
to
reach
the
end,
so
they
will
be
gauging
the...
the
worthiness
of
the
evidence
by
the
same
standards.
and
we
think
that
that
is
a
very
important
part
of
what
we
consider
to
be
a
systemwide
reliability.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
i
think
it
is
more
that
the...
that
the
defendant
has
not
proved
to
the
entire
jury
and--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--that
is
correct.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
that
is
right.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
well,
that...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
to
take
that--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--that
is
right.
and
we...
we
basically,
when
we
have
people
weighing
and
things
like
that,
we
want
them
using
the
same
list,
both
in
aggravation
and
mitigation.
there
is
no
real
principled
way...
the
unanimity
requirement
forces
people
to
gauge
the
weight
and
worthiness
of
this
evidence
as
they
go
through
the
deliberative
process.
we
are
concerned
that
telling
every
juror
that
they
can
find
what
they
want
will
cause
us
simply
to
have
laundry
lists
of
mitigation,
and
where
it
will
simply
not
have
so
much
a
jury
verdict,
and
that
is
after
all
the
sentencer,
as
a
consensus,
a...
a
listing
of
what
everyone
thought
they
believed
to
be
mitigating.
the...
the
jury
is
the
cross-section
of
the
community.
they
are
the
community's
voice.
we
believe
that
what
the
entire
cross
section
of
the
community
does
not
believe
as
mitigating
should
not
be
found
to
be
mitigating,
because
they
are,
after
all,
the
expression
of
the
community's
voice.
this
court
has
said
that
there
is
really
no
one
right
way
to
reach
a
sentencing
decision.
spaziano
and
pulley,
and
many
other
cases,
have
emphasized
that
everyone
has
a
different
way
of
doing
things.
north
carolina's
system
meets
all
of
the
eighth
amendment
concerns.
we
narrow
the
class
of
death-eligible
defendants,
we
allow
all
mitigating
factors
to
be
fully
considered,
as
they
are
necessarily
considered
when
the...
the
decision
is
made
whether
in
fact
mitigating
factors
are
found.
there
is
weighing,
and
even
beyond
weighing,
we
go
further
and
require
the
jury
to
still
determine,
even
if
the
aggravating
outweigh
the
mitigating,
that
it
is
really
sufficiently
substantial
to
warrant
imposition
in
this
death...
in
that
particular
case.
this
is
more
than
the
constitution
requires.
we
believe
that
our
system
provides
a
rational
basis,
a
systemwide
reliability,
and
part
and
parcel
of
that
is
our
mitigating--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--well,
the...
the
statutory--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--well,
of
course
that
is
not
the
system
we
have
before
us
here,
or
even
the
one
that
was
suggested.
and
certainly
wasn't
the
one
that
was--
ms.
joan
herre
byers
--we
require
unanimity
as
to
the
existence
of
the
fact
and
as
to
the
eight
mitigating
factors.
the
legislature
has
already
told
us
those
are
mitigating,
so
there
is
no
judgment
made
on
that.
ms.
joan
herre
byers
as
to
the
others,
we
say
that
the
jury
also
unanimously
should
determine
that,
since
the
jury
is
the
sentencer,
is
the
cross-section
of
the
community,
and
we
believe
the
whole
cross-section
of
the
community
should
also
believe
that
that
in
fact
mitigates.
thank
you.
