justice
white
well,
why...
why
shouldn't
that
be
the
same
rule
about
a
mitigating
circumstance?
how
are
you
going
to
prove
something
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
if
you
only
get
11
votes?
you
haven't
proved
it
any
more
than
you
have
proved
an
aggravating
circumstance
if
you
only
get
11
votes.
justice
white
well,
you
don't
need
a
unanimous
vote
to
acquit
somebody
in
a
criminal
trial.
all
you
need
is
a...
failure
to
have
12
people
vote
for
guilt.
justice
white
well?
justice
white
then
you
don't
need...
well,
that
may
be
so.
that
may
be
so,
but
you
don't
need
a...
but,
you...
you
have
to...
if
you
are
going
to
prove
something,
by
any
normal
understanding,
you
say
that
the
jury
has
to
be
unanimous.
unless
there
is
some
rule
of
less
than
unanimous.
justice
white
sure.
justice
white
so
you
just
don't
think
that
they
have
to...
that
they
should
be
able
to
require
proof
of
a
mitigating
circumstance
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
justice
white
well,
you
haven't
proved
it
if
only
11
people
vote
for
it.
justice
white
well,
you
haven't
proved
it.
justice
white
could...
couldn't
you
live
with
the
notion
that
you
will
make...
you
will
require
a
unanimous
verdict
for
historical
facts,
like
age,
or
whether
he
was
drunk,
or
things
like
that.
but
if...
if
the
jury
says
we
unanimously
find
that
these
facts
exist,
wouldn't
you
let...
would
you
also
have
to
require
that
the
jury,
to
a
man
or
to
a
woman,
believes
that
that
fact
is
mitigating?
justice
white
couldn't...
couldn't
you
live
with
letting
each
juror
give
what
significance
to
a...
an
established
fact,
that
it
wants
to?
justice
white
well,
why
is
that
the
system?
don't
you
require...
you
require
unanimity
both
as
to
the
existence
of
the
fact
and
whether
it's
mitigating.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
well
you...
you
say
that
it
is
unconstitutional
to...
to
require
the
jury
to
unanimously
find
and...
what
a
person...
what
age
a
person
is.
justice
white
suppose,
well...
say
it
is
intoxication.
justice
white
say
there
was
a
dispute
on
a
fact
as
to
whether
the
person
was
intoxicated
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
now,
is
it
unconstitutional
in
your
view
to
require
that
fact,
if
it
is
going
to
be
considered
in
mitigation,
to
be
unanimously
found?
justice
white
so
your
answer
is
yes.
it
is
unconstitutional.
justice
white
what
about
age?
what
if
there
is
an
argument
about
how
old
the
person
is?
justice
white
no,
no.
there
is
a
fight
over...
there
is
a
dispute
as
to
how
old
he
is.
and
that
has
happened
in
this
court,
by
the
way.
is
that...
is
it
wrong
then
to--
justice
white
--historical
facts,
yes.
