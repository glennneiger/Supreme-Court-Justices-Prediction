justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
just
to
get
it
straightened
out
in
my...
in
states
of
course
you
have
a
lot
of
cities
you
can
sue,
municipal
corporations.
do
we
have
separate
municipal
corporations
in
the
territory
of
guam
that
are
subject--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
local
villages
or
towns
have
police
forces,
you
say?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
only
governmental
entity
that
has
a
police
force
that
can
engage
in
the
kind
of
conduct
we
are
talking
about
is
the
territory
itself?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
somewhat
different
from
the
situation
in
most
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
were
there
other
courts
besides
the
courts
that
you
have
just
described
in
the
territories
on
the
continental...
on
the
north
american
continent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
courts,
in
your
view,
were
supposed
to
enforce
1983
in
the
territories?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
ones
that
you
have
just
described?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
why
wouldn't
they
also
be
brought
in
the
similar
courts
in
guam?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
the
source
of
the
cause
of
action
where
immunity
was
upheld
in
that
case?
i
don't
remember
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
what
was
the
cause
of
action
which
was
defeated
by
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
that
was
a
claim
based
on
the
territorial
law
that
was
sought
to
be
enforced?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
claim
that
there
would
be
immunity
in
guam
from
a
suit,
say,
by
a
resident
of
hawaii
for
negligence
committed
by
an
agent
of
guam
in
hawaii?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
not
be
sovereign
immunity
there.
i'm
asking
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--then
they
had
nevada
against
hall.
you
don't
question
the
continuing
validity
of
nevada
against
hall,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
you
don't
claim
that
guam
has
a
greater
immunity
than
nevada
claimed
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
your
emphasis
is
so
much
on
the
courts,
i
don't
know
if
it
will
be
possible
or
not,
but
if
the
plaintiff
could
get
jurisdiction
over
guam
by
some
form
of
process
and
sue
them
in
the
federal
court
in
hawaii...
would
the
hawaiian...
the
federal
district
court
in
hawaii
have
jurisdiction
over
such
a
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
your...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
your
immunity
has
much
to
do
with
the
court
in
which
the
action
is
brought.
that
is
what
i...
i
am
puzzled
about
so
much
reliance
on
the
nature
of
the
tribunal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
we
thought
congress
had
meant
to
include
guam
as
a
person,
that
would
be
a
fairly
strong
overriding
policy,
wouldn't
it?
if
we...
because
your
argument
is
making
that
assumption
now,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
congress
had
specifically
intended
guam
to
be
treated
as
a
person,
you
would
still
say
there
is
a
sovereign
immunity
defense?
