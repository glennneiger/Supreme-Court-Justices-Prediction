mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
territory
of
guam
is
liable
for
deprivations
of
civil
rights.
to
answer
that
question
the
court
must
address
one,
possibly
two
other
questions.
the
first
of
these
is
whether
the
territory
is
a
person
for
the
purpose
of
the
civil
rights
act,
and
if
it
is,
whether
there
is
some
other
form
of
sovereign
immunity
which
may
protect
the
territory
from
liability.
any
analysis
of
the
word
person
in
the
dictionary
act
must
begin
with
the
dictionary
act.
the
dictionary
act,
passed
only
months
before
the
civil
rights
act
in
1871,
defined
persons
to
include
bodies
politic
and
corporate.
this
court
has
ruled
in
puerto
rico
v.
shell
that
the
territory
of
puerto
rico
was
indeed
a
body
politic,
and
the
third
circuit
has
held
that
the
territory
of
the
virgin
islands
was
a
body
politic
as
well.
indeed,
if
we
examine
the
nature
of
the
territory
and
the
self-government
invested
in
the
territory
by
the
organic
act
we
will
find,
i
think,
that...
that
it
makes
sense
to
conclude
that
territory
is
indeed
a
body
politic.
there
are
free
elections
in
the
territory.
the
citizens
of
the
territory
elect
their
local
representatives
and
congressmen
and
a
non-voting
delegate
to
congress.
indeed,
there
are
also
local
courts,
and
a
quite
vibrant
and
active
democracy
exists
in
guam.
there
has
been
some
suggestion,
however,
that
the
dictionary
act
is
not
applicable
in
defining,
or
at
least
has
been
somewhat
diminished
in
defining
the
word
person.
the
first
basis
on
which
this
has
been
suggested
is
the
fact
that
the
1871
act
was
taken
from
the
1866
civil
rights
act,
specifically
section
2.
however,
congress,
in
the
intervening
period,
did
pass
the
civil
rights
act,
and
that
is
persuasive
evidence
that
congress
intended
to
apply
that
definition
to
the
word
person
in
section
1983.
respondents
have
argued
that
the
1874
revision
and
recodification
of
laws,
and
the
repeal
and
reenactment
of
the
dictionary
act,
somehow
overrides
this
court's
finding
in
monell
that
indeed
the
dictionary
act
is
applicable
to
this
term.
i
would
also
suggest
that
the
1874
congress
could
not
have
effected
the
intentions
of
the
1871
congress
when
it
passed
section
1983.
the
second
factor
this
court
relied
upon
in
monell
and
finding
municipalities
to
be
persons
were
the
broad
construction
and
remedial
nature
of
section
1983.
i
would
suggest
that
these
same
principles
apply
to
include
the
territory
within
the
meaning
of
the
word
person.
section
1983
is
to
be
given
as
broad
a
construction
as
possible,
and
technical
definitions
should
not
be
used
to
exclude
any
body
politic
from
the
term
person
in
section
1983.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
well,
maybe
that
is
overstating
it
just
a
bit.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
well,
the
broadest
construction
consistent
with
the
terms
used.
i
think
the
court's
intention
was
to
not
hang
the
liability
or
applicability
of
section
1983
upon
some
technical
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
i
think
there
is
an
argument
to
be
made
for
that.
however,
in
will,
and
i
think
the
substance
of
will
is
that
the
interest
of
federalism
in
the
eleventh
amendment
override
that
broad
construction.
indeed,
it
makes
sense
that
congress
would
not
intend,
given
the
context
of
the
act,
that
states
would
be
liable
under...
states
would
be
persons
for
the
purpose
of
section
1983
given
their
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
and
the
petitioners
would
submit
that
that
is
indeed
the
overriding
considerations
this
court
employed
in
will,
in
holding
that
states
were
not
persons,
that
they
are
given
a
special
respect
and
special
sovereignty
by
the
constitution
and
the
federalist
system.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
the
rule
of
construction
i
think
justice
white
is
referring
to
is
that
person
does
not
ordinarily
include
the
sovereign.
however,
that
is
not
a
hard-and-fast
rule,
as
this
court
ruled
in
omaha,
in
wilson
v.
the
omaha
tribes.
the
court
must
examine
the
purpose
and
context,
as
well
as
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
congress
would
never,
and
has
never
indeed,
considered
any
territory
to
be
a
sovereign.
congress
is
the
plenary
sovereign
over
any
territory,
and
certainly
over
guam.
i
suggest
then,
that
given
that
context
and
given
that
understanding
of
congress,--
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
--they
have
sovereign
immunity
from
territorial...
from
acts
arising
on
the
territorial
law
in
territorial
courts.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
polyblank
that
the
logical
and
practical--
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
i'm
saying
that
it
is
illogical
to
consider
that
congress
would
have
intended
to
immunize
a
territory,
which
is
a
creature
of
federal
law,
from
an
act
of
federal
law.
the
logic
of
polyblank
is
that
the
territory
itself
creates
the
rights
which
flow
to
the
citizens
of
the
territory.
therefore,
it
is
immune.
that's
the
explicit
language.
i
would
suggest
that
there,
that
any
immunity
from
the
federal
law
must
be
a
matter
of
congressional
intent.
and
there
is
no
tradition
of
immunity
from
federal
law
in
territories,
because
they
are
indeed
creations
of
federal
law.
it's
internally
inconsistent.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
because
this
acts
on
the
color
of...
district
of
columbia
law
were
not
included
in...
in
the...
in
1983
at
that
time,
and
this
court
held
that
district...
properly
so,
that
the
district
of
columbia
is
neither
a
state
or
a
territory.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
i
think
that's
some
evidence,
although
the
cases
obviously
are
not
consistent
in
that
regard.
states
are
included
in
section
1983,
yet
they
are
not
persons.
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
has
held
the
district
of
columbia
liable
under
the
civil
rights
act,
and
i
think
that
is
appropriate.
i
think
the
distinguishing
factor
is
the
eleventh
amendment
and
federalism.
i
think
it
is
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
which
set
states
apart
from
territories
or
municipalities.
and
i
think
that
can
be
drawn
also
from
the
conclusion
in
monell
that
section
1983
applies
to
all
entities
which
are
not
parts
of
the
state
for
eleventh
amendment
purposes.
and
the
history
of
this
court's
decisions
imply
that
distinction,
imply
the
eleventh
amendment
as
being
an
important
factor
in
the
interpretation
of
section
1983
and
governmental
liability.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
no,
i
believe
this
court
should
be
bound
by
that
act.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
no,
territories
are
bodies
politic,
as
this
court
has
held
in
puerto
rico
v.
shell.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
the
1871
version,
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
it
said
corporations
and
partnerships
were
substituted
for--
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
--no,
that
was
passed
later.
the
court
also
has
relied
in
making
determinations
of
governmental
liability
under
section
1983
on
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
but
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
did
not
base
any
of
its
decisions
on
the
specific
legislative
history
of
section
1983.
indeed,
there
was
only
one,
one
mention
of
specific
instance
of
the
understanding
that
a
city
would
be
liable
under
section
1983
in
the
specific
legislative
history
of
that
act.
i
think
that
the
court
has
taken
the
term
person
and
found
the
legislative
intent
within
the
definition
of
that
term.
it
would
seem
to
me
that,
given
the
historical
context
of
the
civil
rights
act,
that
congress
would
have
intended
it
to
ply...
apply
in
territories
as
well,
and
to
territories.
this
is
a
reconstructionary
act.
indeed
slavery
in
the
territories
had
been
something
that
was
heatedly
debated
both
prior
to
the
civil
war
and
after
it.
witness
the
missouri
compromise.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
well,
given
the...
given
the
constitutional
immunity
which
this
court
relied
on...
on...
in
will,
i
think
there
is
ample
basis
for
the
court's
decision
in
will.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
right.
and
i
think
in
perceiving
that
intent
this
court
applied
two
standards
that
apply
only
to
eleventh
amendment
suits,
specifically
that
indeed
the
eleventh
amendment
applies
only
to
states,
and
that
congress
would
have
made...
would
have
clearly
expressed
its
intention
to
alter
the
constitutional
balance.
now,
that
balance
is
not
at
issue
here.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
there
is
no
question
that
states
were
the
main
focus
of
the
debates
on
reconstruction.
but
i
would
also
note
that
congress
would
not
intend
to
apply
a
remedy
such
as
the
civil
rights
act
in
states,
and
provide
a
haven
for
bigots
and
ku
klux
klan
and
what
have
you
in
territories
by
failing
to
apply
the
act
there.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
no.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
well,
if...
if
section
1983
were
not
construed
to
apply
in
territories,
and
i
suggest--
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
--which
might
not
be
too
hard.
[laughter]
the
second
issue
that
this
court
must
face
if
it
determines
that
territories
are
persons
is
the
issue
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
i
think
we
have
touched
on
that
already.
this
court
has
never
held
any
governmental
entity
to
be
immune
from
the
federal
civil
rights
act,
other
than
states
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
and
indeed,
when
it
has
held
such
an
immunity
existed
with
respect
to
individuals,
it
has
found
only
immunities
which
were
well
grounded
in
reason
and
history.
there
is
no
immunity
for
federal
action
in
a
territory...
against
a
territory.
the
territories,
as
i
stated
before,
are
acts
of
congress,
given
the
powers...
given
their
powers
by
congress,
and
there
has
not
been
one
case
cited
to
this
court
or
in
any
brief
which
would
demonstrate
an
immunity
to
a
claim
brought
under
federal
law
with
respect
to
a
territory.
i
think
the
third
circuit's
reasoning
in
frett,
in
ocasio
is
also
appropriate
for
consideration.
congress
would
not
have
applied
a
bill
of
rights,
and
specifically
extended
the
fourteenth
and
fifth
amendments
to
the
territory,
and
at
the
same
time
intended
to
keep
the
territories
immune
from
actions
brought
pursuant
to
section
1983,
if
indeed
the
territories
are
persons.
by
way
of
conclusion
i
would
just
like
to
add
perhaps
a
practical
point,
that
the
territory
needs
this
remedy.
the
people
of
the
territory
need
to
have
a
sense
that
their
civil
rights
are
secure.
there
is
no
effective
remedy
under
section
1983
when
the
only
person
you
can
sue
is
an
$8.00
an
hour
police
officer.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
no.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
i
think
they
are
in
the
same
position,
frankly.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
the
states
are
the
entities
that
have
the
favored
position.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
there
are
local
villages,
but
the
only
village
officer
is
what...
is
a
mayor,
and
he
essentially
has
no
power.
they
don't
run
any
of
the
police
force
[inaudible].
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
no,
they
don't.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
another
important
point.
the
government
of
guam
is
almost
an
overwhelming
power.
they
license
cars,
license
businesses,
run
the
only
police
force,
run
the
only
hospital,
provide
telephone
service,
provide
electrical
service,
provide
water.
and
without
an
effective
remedy
against
an
entity
of
such
great
magnitude,
i
suggest
that
it
is
going
to
be
a
difficult
task
to
instill
american
traditions
of
democracy
and
liberty
in
the
territories.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time,
please.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
thank
you,
your
honor.
this
court
stated
in
polyblank
that
the
sovereign
is
exempt
from
suit
not
because
of
any
formal
conception
or
obsolete
theory,
but
on
the
logical
and
practical
ground
that
there
can
be
no
legal
right
as
against
the
authority
that
makes
the
law
on
which
the
right
depends.
i
think
it's
clear
that
it
was
the
intention
of
the
court,
and
the
only
tradition
of
immunity
with
respect
to
territories
is
for
acts
arising
under
territorial
law.
i
think
amicus
has
a
problem.
it
says
on
one
hand
that
guam
is
sovereign
enough,
has
enough
self-government
to
be
treated
for
a
state...
as
a
state
for
section
1983
purposes.
however,
when
this
argument
is
raised,
that
it
is
not
an
immunity
which
extends
to
acts
under
federal
law,
amicus
says
well,
it
is
not
really
a
separate
sovereign.
and
i
think
that
points
up
the
reasoning
of
this
court's
prior
decisions
concerning
section
1983
in
the
eleventh
amendment,
specifically
that
it
is...
the
eleventh
amendment
had
always...
has
always
played
an
enormous
role
in
determining
governmental
liability
under
section
1983.
indeed,
the
court
did
not
hold
in
monell
that
simply
cities
are
liable.
it
said
that
arms
of
the
state,
arms...
entities
which
are
not
arms
of
the
state
for
eleventh
amendment
purposes,
is
liable.
i
will
suggest
that
there
will
be
no
finding,
if
we
review
the
legislative
history,
of
any
comment
in
that
regard.
but
that
is
the
conclusion
that
the
court
drew
from
the
use
of
the
word
person
and
the
legislative
context
of
the
act.
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
maintain
that
as
a...
as
at
least
a
guide
or
a
consideration,
as
the
court
said
in
will,
in
determining
the
scope
of
section
1983.
with
respect
to
respondent's
point
that
initially
the
only
courts
existing
in
territories
were
federal
courts,
i
will
suggest
that
in
1871
or
1874
congress
was
well
aware
that
the
territories
were
going
to
become
states,
and
at
some
point
state
courts
would
be
established
in
what
would
become
states,
formerly
territories.
i'd
suggest,
then,
that
that
in
no
way
diminishes
the
court's
point
in
will
that
the
purpose...
one
of
the
purposes
of
section
1983
was
to
provide
a
federal
forum
for
vindication
of
civil
rights.
much
has
also
been
made
of
the
1874
revision
of
the
dictionary
act.
but
the
more
specific
and
applicable
revision
was
to
section
1983,
declaring
that
acts
under
color
of
territoriel
law
were
now
subject
to
liability.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
correct.
but
there
is
some
intention
demonstrated--
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
r.
siegel
against
a
person.
but
it
was...
there
was
a
clear
intention
to
apply
whatever
the
original
scope
of
the
word
person
was
in
1871,
because
that
is
the
congress
that
passed
the
law,
to
territories.
thank
you
very
much.
