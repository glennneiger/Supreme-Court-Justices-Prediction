justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
also
comes
to
us
from
the
ninth
circuit.
the
issue
is
whether
the
territory
of
guam
and
its
officials
are
subject
to
suit
under
a
statute
known
as
42
u.s.c.
section
1983.
the
district
court
dismissed
claims
asserted
under
that
statute,
and
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
also
affirm,
and
we
hold
that
“neither
the
territory
nor
any
of
its
officers
acting
in
their
official
capacities
is
a
person”
under
the
statute.
justice
scalia
joins
the
opinion
except
for
part
2b;
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
justice
marshall.
justice
kennedy
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
this
case.
