mr.
john
patrick
mason
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
whether
the
government
of
guam
is
liable
under
section
1983
is
a
question
of
congressional
intent.
what
did
congress
intend
concerning
the
territories
in
1874,
not
1871,
but
1874,
when
territories
were
added
to
the
1871
civil
rights
act,
and
what
did
congress
intend
in
guam's
organic
act?
now,
petitioners
would
disregard
guam's
mandate
for
self-government
in
its
organic
act,
and
petitioners
would
avoid
the
intent
of
congress
to
allow
the
people
of
guam,
through
their
duly
elected
legislators,
to
balance
the
interests
of
private
litigants
and
the
goals
of
public
government.
one
of
the
first
things
you
can
look
at
is
the
purpose
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1874.
a
major
purpose
was
to
provide
a
federal
forum
to
enforce
fourteenth
amendment
rights.
local
officials
in
the
states
either
would
not
or
could
not
grant
the
citizens
the
equal
protection,
due
processes
and
privileges
and
immunities
guaranteed
by
the
fourteenth
amendment.
however,
in
territories
the
situation
is
different.
and
i
think
there
is
some
confusion
here
about
the
courts
of
the
territories,
because
the
territories
had
congress...
congress
established
the
courts
in
the
territories,
and
congress...
or
the
president
appointed
the
judges
that
presided
over
those
courts
in
the
territories.
in...
you
can
see
in
the
1874
revision
and
consolidation
of
the
federal
laws,
the
provisions
common
to
all
territories,
it
indicates
that
under
federal
law
the
congress
had
a
supreme
court
in
each
territory
with
three
judges
who
were
appointed
by
the
president.
and
then
the
territories
were
divided
into
three
judicial
districts.
and
one
of
those
judges,
then,
would
preside
in
that
judicial
district.
and
then
the
courts
in
those
districts
would...
the
judges
in
those
districts
would
hold
court
"for
the
purpose
of
hearing
and
determining
all
matters
and
cases,
except
those
which
united
states
is
a
party.
"
so
these
were
courts
appointed
by
congress,
or
created
by
congress,
and
these
were
judges
appointed
by
the
president.
and
if
a
1983
action
was
to
be
brought
in
the
territories,
it
would
be
brought
in
those
courts.
so,
we
didn't
have
the
same
situation
as
we
had
in
the
states,
where
they
needed
to
provide
a
federal
forum.
in
fact,
the
courts
of
the
territories
were,
in
the
sense
that
they
were
created
for
the
territories
by
the
federal
government
with
judges
appointed
by
the
president,
a
federal
forum.
so
that
purpose
really
doesn't
apply
in
the
territories
as
it
did
in
the
states.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
yes.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
there
were
justice
of
the
peace
courts
and
probate
courts,
but
if
you
look
at
the
provisions--
mr.
john
patrick
mason
--that
would
be
brought
in
the
district
court
of
the
territory
in
1874.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
yes.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
well,
on
guam...
okay,
the
situation
was
on
guam,
in
1950
when
congress
gave
guam
self-government
under
the
organic
act,
they
created
the
district
court
of
guam,
and
it
was
the
same.
that
district
court
had
all
jurisdiction,
but
then
they
allowed
the
legislature
of
guam
to
create
such
other
courts
as
it
decided.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
and
so,
one
year
later
the
legislature
created
well,
basically
the
island
court.
but
it...
at
that
point
it
left
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
for
most
felony
cases
and
for
cases...
civil
cases
above
$2,000.
so,
there
again,
if
you
had
a
civil
rights
action
at
that
time
brought
in
a
court
of
guam
it
would
be
brought
in
the
district
court
unless
it
was
less
than
$2,000.
but,
so...
but
in
18...
in
1974
then
the
legislature
went
ahead
and
created
the
superior
court
of
guam,
which
at
that
time
then
actions
under
federal
law
were
brought
in
the
district
court
and
actions
under
local
law
were
brought
in
the
superior
court
of
guam.
but
the
appeals
from
this
superior
court
still
go
to
the
district
court
of
guam
before,
and
then
to
the
ninth
circuit.
so
district
court
of
guam
still
has
that
jurisdiction.
but
in
1874,
if
we
look
at
the
intent
of
the
congress
when
it
added
territories,
you
can
see
that
at
that
time...
what
they
were
trying
to
get
at
that
a
federal
forum
did
exist
in
the
territories
at
that
time.
the
situation
on
guam
that
happened
in
1974
didn't
apply
to
the
territories
at
that
time.
another
important
thing,
of
course,
in
deciding
what
the
intent
of
congress
was
is
the
common
law
sovereign
immunity
that
existed
in
the
territories.
and
this
court
has
held
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
override
established
common
law
defenses
and
immunities
without
specific
language
to
the
contrary.
in
1874
the
territories
had
an
established
tradition
of
immunity
from
suit
without
its
consent,
and
this
court
so
held
in
the
kawananakoa
case.
and
in
fact
in
that
case
this
court
specifically
rejected
the
argument
that
was
made
that
territories
are
like
municipal
corporations.
and
the
court
held
that
the
territories
had
immunity
by
the
nature
of
the
type
of
government
that
was
created
in
their
organic
act.
and
then
in
the
rosaly
case
in
1913,
this
court
then
applied
that
reasoning
to
the
unincorporated
territories.
there
were,
of
course,
only
incorporated
territories
in
1874,
but
the
reasoning
was
applied
to
the
unincorporated
territories,
which
guam
is,
in
1913
by
this
court.
now,
petitioners
argue
that
kawananakoa
and
rosaly
don't
apply,
because
that
means
there
is
only
sovereign
immunity
in
the
local
courts
under
local
law.
well,
what
that
overlooks,
of
course,
as
i
talked
about
a
minute
ago,
is
the
nature
of
the
court
system
in
the
territories.
and
in
fact
these
congressionally
created
courts
were
the
local
courts,
although
they
were
created
by
congress.
and
they
were
to
hear
all
matters
and
cases,
and
that
would
include
19...
section
1983
actions.
and
also,
kawananakoa
was
a...
the
action
where
immunity
was
held...
was
upheld
was
actually
brought
in
one
of
those
congressionally
created
courts,
and
the
immunity
was
upheld.
and
also,
kawananakoa
cites
with
approval
three
prior
territory
cases,
which
are
wisconsin
v.
doty,
langford
v.
king,
and
fisk
v.
cuthbert.
and
there
again,
those
were
cases
in
which
immunity
was
upheld
and
the
courts
in
which
the
cases
were
brought
were
these
congressionally
created
territorial
courts.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
what
were
the
courts?
mr.
john
patrick
mason
okay,
the
cause
of
action...
or
causes
of
action...
the
langford
case
was
a
writ
of
mandate
to
enforce...
force
the
county
treasurer
to
accept
a
writ
in
payment
of
taxes.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
yes.
i
think
all
three...
all
three
of
those
cases
were
based
on
territorial
law.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
no,
i
don't
think
there
would
be.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
well,
the--
mr.
john
patrick
mason
--well,
no,
if
the
action--
mr.
john
patrick
mason
--no,
i
don't
think
that
is
necessarily
true,
no.
not
at
all.
but
as
to
laws,
again,
the
jurisdiction
of
these
courts
was
for
all
cases
that
were
brought
in
the
territory.
and
so
when
local...
when
federal
laws
are
created
and
made
specifically
applicable
to
the
territory,
then
they
are
basically
a
law
of
the
territory,
if
congress
makes
them
applicable.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
well,
it
would
depend
on
guam's
immunity.
i
think,
so
it
would
depend--
mr.
john
patrick
mason
--the
reason
i
am
bringing
up
the
courts
is
that
they
claim
because...
that
these
are...
that
these
courts
are
somehow
courts
of
a
separate
sovereign,
and
therefore
the
common
law
immunity
doesn't
apply,
the
common
law
immunity
which
was
incorporated
in
the
1871
civil
rights
act,
it
doesn't
apply.
but
what
we're
saying
is
it
does
apply
in
those
very
courts.
and
those
very
courts
were
the
ones
in
which
the
kawananakoa
case
was
brought.
the
other
thing
we
can
look
at,
and
this
is...
this
is...
specifically
is
the
definition
of
the
word
person.
we
can
look
at
the
act
itself.
and
i
think
again
there
was
some
confusion
because
territories
were
not
in
the
act
in
1871.
it
was
only
prohibitions
for
persons
acting
under
color
of
state
law.
it
wasn't
until
1874
that
territories
were
added.
and
in
1874,
when
territories
were
added,
that
was,
in
that
same
act,
was
when
the
dictionary
act
was
changed.
and
it
was
changed
from
bodies
corporate,
or
politic
and
corporate
to
partnerships
and
corporations.
therefore,
in
that
same
act...
and
the
reason
for
the
change
was
stated
by
the
committee,
was
so
that
the...
a
drafter
of
a
federal
statute
would
not
have
to
take
care
to
exclude
states,
territories,
foreign
governments
and
the
like
from
the
definition.
so
here,
when
territories
are
specifically
added,
the
definition
under
federal
law
does
not
include
territories.
another
indication
of
congressional
intent
in
both
1874,
and
this
has
to
do
with
guam
also,
is...
and
an
indication
that
the
federal...
the
congress
is
really
treating
territories
like
states,
was
the
provision
that
was
in
the
organic
acts
of
the
territories
at
the
time.
and
this
is
in
the
provisions
common
to
all
territories,
it
is
stated
that
the
constitution
and
all
laws
of
the
united
states
which
are
not
locally
inapplicable,
of
course
18...
section
1983
had
been
made
locally
applicable
in
1874,
those
which
are
not
locally
inapplicable
shall
have
the
same
force
and
effect
in
the
organized
territories
as
elsewhere
in
the
united
states.
so
those
laws
were
to
have
the
same
force
and
effect.
then
on
guam
in
1968
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
specifically
added
to
the
organic
act
and
those
rights
that
were
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
when
the
congress
added
that
provision
it
specifically
stated
in
that
same
amendment
the
provisions,
and
that
would
include
those
provisions
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
shall
have
the
same
force
and
effect
as
in
the
united
states
or
in
any
state
of
the
united
states.
it
went
on
to
say
in
that
same
amendment
all
laws
of
congress
in
the
guam
legislature
inconsistent
with
this
are
repealed
to
the
extent
of
their
inconsistency.
so
i
think
that
this
indicates
that
the
residents
of
guam,
like
the
residents
of
the
states,
in
section
1983
action
were
to
have
the
same
rights.
they
were
to
have
rights
against
individuals
who
violated
their
constitutional
rights.
but
it
did
not
provide
for
damages
against
the
territory
governments,
just
like
it
didn't
in
the
states.
now,
if
we...
another
indication,
of
course,
is
the
role
in
1874
that
the
federal
government
played
in
financing
this...
the
territories.
at
that
time
there
were,
under
the
provisions
common
to
all
territories,
there
were
direct
appropriations
by
congress
to
the
territories.
and
they
paid
the
expenses
of
the
legislature
and
government
appointed
officials,
and
there
was
even
a
direct
appropriation,
a
contingency
expense
for
the
territory
of
washington
of
$1,500
and
of
$1,000
for
the
other
territories
then
existing.
and
because
of
the
direct
financial
role
that
congress
played,
it's
doubtful
that
they
would
intend
to
incur
liability
for
the
territories
without
specifically
saying
so.
now,
the
other
indication
of
intent,
we
go
to
the
organic
act
of
guam.
and
when
congress
exercised
its
plenary
control
and
created
the
government
of
guam
in
1950,
it
created
one
of
those
entities
it
had
under
kawananakoa:
common
law
sovereign
immunity.
we
have
to
remember,
before
1950,
if
you
brought
a
suit
against
the
administering
body
of
the
territory
of
guam,
you
brought
it
against
the
navy.
so
it
was
a
suit
against
the
department
of
the
navy.
it
wasn't
until
1950
that
the
government
of
guam
was
created.
and
they
created
one
of
those
bodies
in
the
tradition
of
the
territories
that
had
common
law
sovereign
immunity
with
separate
branches
of
government
with
separate
powers.
but
there
was
a
question
then
even
whether
you
could
sue
the
government
of
guam,
even
if
they
consented.
so
in
1959
the
congress
corrected
that.
and
in
corrected
that,
they
gave...
stated
clearly
in
the
situations
in
which
immunity
would
be
waived.
they
said
that
the
government
of
guam
could
be
sued
with
the
consent
of
the
legislature
evidenced
by
enacted
law
in
contract
and
in
tort.
and
the
assistant
secretary
of
the
interior
submitted
a
letter
with
the
bill
when
it
went
before
the
congress,
and
he
indicated
in
there
the
purpose
was
to
allow
the
officials,
or
the
elected
officials
of
the
territory
to
determine
when
the
best
interests
of
the
territory
would
be
served,
you
know,
by
balancing
private
litigants
against
public
goals
of
government.
now,
the
guam
legislature
has
struck
the
balance
under
which
authority
they
were
given
by
congress,
and
they
have
allowed
negligence
actions
against
the
government
with
a
maximum
of
$100,000
for
wrongful
death
and
$300,000
for
personal
injury.
the
petitioners'
claim
would
allow
unlimited
damages
for
intentional
torts
under
section
1983.
now,
this
would
negate
the
intent
of
congress
and
negate
the
intent
of
guam's
duly
elected
officials.
therefore,
we
feel
that
since
the
intent
of
congress,
at
least
in
1959,
it
is
explicitly
clear
with
respect
to
torts,
and
it
says
we
are
going
to
let
the
guam
legislature
balance
the
interests
in
this,
in
cases
of
tort.
and
the
guam
legislature
has
done
that--
mr.
john
patrick
mason
--well,
it...
what
it
does,
it
gives
an
intent
of
congress
in
creating
this
entity
called
the
government
of
guam.
i
don't
think
it
amends
everything...
anything.
it
just...
it
says
how...
how
this
would
apply.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
well,
i
think
there
is
two
indications
of
congressional
intent.
there
is
what
happened
with
the
territories
in
1874,
you
can
look
at
that,
and
then
as
to
guam
specifically
as
to
congressional
intent,
you
have
to
look
at
the...
because
guam
didn't
exist
of
course
then.
you
have
to--
mr.
john
patrick
mason
--well,
i
think--
mr.
john
patrick
mason
--well,
i
think
it
is
an
indication
of
how...
what
liability
congress
intended
to
create
for
the
government
of
guam,
where
they
had
not
specifically
stated
there
was
liability.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
well,
since
this
is--
mr.
john
patrick
mason
--no.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
well,
as
to
guam
it
shows
what
congress...
the
law
that
congress
made,
and
that
it's...
the
1874
act's
applicability,
you
have
to
look
at
the
two
to
determine
congressional...
congress
could
have
said
in
18...
in
1959,
the
territory
of
guam
shall
be
liable
for
section
1983
suits.
and,
you
know,
you
can
say
did
that
amend
the
law
or
not.
it
just
made
them
specifically
liable.
but
what
they
did
say
is,
in
tort,
we
are
going
to
let
the
guam
legislature
say
whether
there
is
liability.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
that
was
in
1890...
1898,
in
the
treaty
of
paris.
it
was
guam,
puerto
rico--
mr.
john
patrick
mason
--yes.
yes.
and
at
that
time
guam
was
placed
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
navy,
and
it
continued
that
way
until
1950.
and
basically
the
naval
governor
had
total
authority
on
guam,
administrative
authority.
it
wasn't
until
1950
that
guam
was
able
to
obtain
self-government,
in
1950.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
well,
there
wasn't...
puerto
rico
obtained
self-government
a
lot
sooner
than
that.
mr.
john
patrick
mason
yes.
guam
waited
50
years.
i
don't
think
puerto
rico
waited
nearly
that
long.
and
so
we
would
ask
this
court
then
to
uphold
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
that
guam
is
not
subject
to
liability
under
section
1983.
thank
you.
