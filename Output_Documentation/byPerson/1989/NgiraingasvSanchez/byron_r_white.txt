well,...
sort
of
a
standard
rule
of
construction
that
if
you,
if
you
intend
to
include
a
sovereign
or
a
state
you
ought
to
say
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
territories
are
just
subject
to
tort
suits
despite
the
territorial
legislature
saying
they
are
immune?
they
have
sovereign
immunity,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
they
have
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a
long-standing
tradition,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
1983
wasn't...
didn't
have
to
respect
that
kind
of
immunity.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
original
form
of
the
dictionary
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
as
amended,
what
did
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that
we
shouldn't
even
look
at
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
people
who
were
doing
the
violating
wouldn't
be
immune
in
their
individual
capacity.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
not
really
a
haven,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about...
what
about
the
people
of
the
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
should
give
the
people
in
the
territory
favored
position
as
compared
to
the
people
of
the
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
use
that
to
interpret
1983
as
amended
in
1874?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
we
should
use...
we
should
refer
to
this
action
in
1959
to
interpret
the
1974
as
amended
1983...
the
1874.
