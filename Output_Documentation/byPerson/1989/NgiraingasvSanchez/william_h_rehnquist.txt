chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-1281,
alex
ngiraingas
v.
francisco
sanchez.
mr.
siegel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
court
literally
say
in
monell
that
section
1983
was
to
give...
to
be
given
the
broadest
possible
construction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
a
strange
view,
certainly.
why
on
earth
would
you
give
anything
the
broadest
possible
construction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
broadest
possible
construction,
i
suppose,
would
include
states.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
our
decision
in
district
of
columbia
v.
carter?
you
know,
certainly
the
district
of
columbia
was
a
creature
of
federal
law,
too,
but
we
said
that
1983
as
enacted
didn't
cover
it,
didn't
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereas
you
say
that
guam
would
be
a
territory.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
would
have
to
flee
to
the
territory
and
then
be
elected
to
some
office,
wouldn't
they?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
territorial
legislature
could
give
the
people
everything
that
section
1983
can
give
them,
can't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
the...
the
legislature
doesn't
realize
that
the
people
need
this
remedy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
siegel.
mr.
mason.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
did
the
united
states
acquire
dominion
over
guam?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
end
of
the
spanish-american
war.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mason.
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
siegel,
you
have
14
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
against
a
person.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
siegel.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-1281,
ngiraingas
against
sanchez
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
