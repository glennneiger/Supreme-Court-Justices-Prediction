on
that
line
of
reasoning
they
probably
would
have
wanted
it
to
apply
to
the
states
as
well,
in
fact
especially.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
a
decision
not
based
on
immunity,
but
based
on
the...
the
perceived
intent
of
the
congress
at
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
it
is
much
more
likely
that
the
reconstruction
congress
would
have
been,
would
have
been
more
concerned
about
states
than
it
would
have
been...
about
constitutional
violations
by
states
than
it
would
have
been
about
constitutional
violations
by
territories
that
are
subject
to
the
complete
control
of
the
federal
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
congressional
intent
as
to
what
this
statute
means.
you
could,
you
can
consider
the
20th
century
action
to
be
indication
of
what
congress
believed
1983
meant.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
congress
might
have
believed
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
liability
it
thought
it
was
creating.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
saying
that
the
act
that
created
guam
amends
1983
insofar
as
guam
is
concerned,
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
then
all
you
are
saying
is
that
that
shows
what
congress
thought
the
law
was
in
19...
in
the
1950s.
justice

the
years,
wasn't
it,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
sooner,
but
for
quite
a
time
there
was
a
naval
governor
there.
