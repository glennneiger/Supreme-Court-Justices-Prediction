mr.
james
a.
feldman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that,
for
the
reasons
given
in
our
brief,
first,
guam
is
not
a
person
for
purposes
of
section
1983,
and
second,
guam
is
entitled
to
assert
sovereign
immunity
as
a
defense
to
this
suit.
in
other
words,
because
guam
is
a
self-governing
entity
much
like
states,
it
is
entitled
to
be
treated
as
a
state
would
be
treated
for
purposes
of
1983.
i
would
like
to
make
three
major
points
this
afternoon,
other...
among
those
that
are
made
in
our
brief.
first,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
guam
is
to
be
considered
a
person,
there
is
direct
and
rather
conclusive
evidence
that
the
congress
that
added
the
words
1874
did
not
intend
to
include
territories
within
the
scope
of
the
word
person.
and,
in
addition,
that
that
congress
did
intend
that
states
and
territories
be
treated
alike
for
purposes
of
section
1983.
second,
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
19...
that
section
1983
was
not
intended
to
override
well
accepted
common
law
notions
of
immunities
and
defenses.
in
1874,
in
fact
both
in
1874
and
before
and
after
that
date,
the
idea
of
territorial
sovereign
immunity
was
well
accepted
in
our
law.
congress
would
therefore
not
have
expected
that
a
territory
would
be
liable
under
section
1983,
and
under
this
court's
reasoning
in
will
and
a
whole
line
of
other
cases,
did
not
intend
to
make
a
territory
liable
under
section
1983.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
don't
believe
there
is.
for
one
thing,
in
1874
when
this
congress
acted,
there
was
no
such
distinction
in
the
law.
but,
in
any
event,
when
that
distinction
came
into
the
law
just
after
the
turn
of
the
century,
it
was
primarily
for
purposes
of
determining
which
constitutional
rights
apply
to
a
territory.
it
was
not
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
sovereign
immunity
applied
to
a
territory.
and,
indeed,
when...
as
has
already
been
pointed
out,
when
the
court
reached
those
issues
in
the
hawaii
case,
hawaii
was
an
incorporated
territory,
i
believe
at
the
time,
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
entitled
to
the
sovereign
immunity.
and
when
the
court
reached
it
in
puerto
rico,
which
was
not
an
incorporated
territory,
the
court
held
the
same
thing.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think,
as
a
general
matter,
the
arguments
that
we
have
advanced
in
support
of
guam's
immunity
in
this
case
would
apply
to
the
other
territories,
if
it
is
a
self-governing
entity.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
bit
more
difficult
a
case
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
the
district...
the
statute,
as
it
reads
now,
includes
states,
territories
and
the
district
of
columbia.
now,
states
and
territories
are
categories
of
entities,
but
the
district
of
columbia
is
an
individual
unit.
there
is
only
one
of
them.
and
that
possibly
may
indicate
that
the
district
of
columbia
after
all
does
have
a
sui
generis
quality.
but
in
any
event,
the
relevant
congressional
intent
with
respect
to
the
district
of
columbia
was
that
of
the
1979
congress
that
added
the
district
of
columbia
to
the
statute.
and
that
congress
was
acting
in
a
rather
different
legal
environment
than
were
the
reconstruction
congresses
in
the
1870s.
therefore,
in
short,
i
don't...
i
think
you
would
have
to
look
specifically
at
that
action
to
determine
the
status
of
the
district
of
columbia.
but
insofar
as
the
district
of
columbia
is
a
fully
self-governing
entity,
and
congress
intended
to
make
it
such,
i
think
many
of
our
arguments
would
apply
to
the
district
of
columbia.
it...
my
third
point...
well,
my
third
point
i
wanted
to
make
today
was
that
with
respect
to
sovereign
immunity
issues,
there
is
no
substantial
dispute
that
guam
is,
as
a
general
matter,
entitled
to
assert
sovereign
immunity,
both
as
a
result
of
the
organic
acts
and
as
a
result
of
the
long-established
tradition
of
territorial
common
law
sovereign
immunity.
petitioner
asserts,
however,
that
guam
is
not
entitled
to
assert
its
sovereign
immunity
in
the
courts
of
a
separate
sovereign
or
in
cases
arising
under
the
laws
of
a
separate
sovereign.
now,
in
fact,
guam
is
not
an
entirely
separate
sovereign
from
the
united
states.
but
even
if
it
were
seen
as
a
separate
sovereign,
the
law
has
been
fairly
clear
since
the
very
early
years
of
this
country,
and
you
could
look
at
judge...
at
chief
justice
marshall's
decision
in
the
schooner
exchange
case,
that
a
sovereign
that
is
entitled
to
assert
immunity
is
entitled
to
do
so
both
in
its
own
courts
and
in
the
courts
of
the
united
states,
and
both
with
respect
to
causes
of
action
arising
under
its
own
laws
and
under
those
arising
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
would...
you
don't...
i
would
suggest
you
don't.
it
really...
the
sovereign
immunity
issue
arises...
was
not
passed
on
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
arises
only
if
the
court
were
to
determine,
contrary
to
our
argument,
that
guam
were
a
person.
then
it...
you...
it...
the
issue
of
sovereign
immunity
would
have
to
be
confronted
by
someone.
it
could
be
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals,
but
it
has
been
fully
briefed
here
and
this
court
could
choose
to
decide
it
also.
with
respect
to
the
dictionary
act,
i
think
most
of
the
important
points
have
been
made.
it
was
the
18...
the
very
same
congress,
in
fact
in
the
very
same
piece
of
legislation
that
added
the
word
"or
territory"
to
the
statute.
it
was
that
very
same
congress
at
the
same
time
that
changed
the
dictionary
act.
now,
although
we
don't
have
any
specific
commentary
relating
to
the
addition
of
the
word
"or
territory",
we
do
have
specific
commentary
cited
in
the
brief
of
respondent
for
the
meaning
of
the
word
person
at
that
time.
and
the
revision
commission
indicated
both,
that
the
word
person
should
not
ordinarily
apply
to
states,
territories
or
foreign
governments,
and
that
that
why...
that
was
why
it
was
recommending
the
change
in
the
dictionary
act.
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
relevant
both
because
it
establishes
that
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
include
territories
within
the
scope
of
the
word
person,
and
because
that
congress
intended
that
states
and
territories
be
treated
alike
for
purposes
of
section
1983.
there
is
no
indication
of
any
contrary
congressional
intent
about
this
issue,
and
indeed,
this
revision
commission
note
is
in
full
accord
with
the
statement
in
will
that
the
word
person
does
not
ordinarily
include
the
sovereign.
in
fact,
it
applies...
it
supplies
conclusive
evidence
that
that
congress
felt
that
those
entities
entitled
to
sovereign
immunity,
states,
territories
and
foreign
governments,
were
not...
were
not
generally
intended
to
be
encompassed
within
the
word
person.
with
respect
to
the...
with
respect
to
the
sovereign...
a
second
basis
for
holding
that
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
include
territories
within
the
scope
of
the
word
person,
is
the
long
history
of
sovereign
immunity
that
is
cited
in
the
briefs
and
that
has
been
discussed.
i
would
point
out,
in
addition
to
that,
that
having
decided...
made...
having
decided
the
will
case
the
way
the
court
did,
the
evidence
that
congress
intended
states
and
territories
to
be
treated
the
same
for
this
statute,
and
in
fact
that
the
court
had
in
the
past
and
has
in
the
past
treated
territories
and
states
as
a
general
matter
of
common
law
sovereign
immunity
in
identical
fashion,
would
suggest
that
the
same
result
should
be
reached
here
as
was
reached
in
the
will
state...
will
case.
it
would
be
odd
to
say
that
the
congress
that
was
interested
in
protecting
civil
rights
in
the
southern
states
in
the
1870s
intended
that
section
1983
apply
with
greater
force
to
territories
than
to
states,
when
the
addition
of
territories
to
the
statute
was,
after
all,
just
an
afterthought
on
congress'
part,
made
three
years
later,
and
was
not...
the
focus
of
congress's
intention,
of
course,
at
that
time
was
on
enforcement
of
constitutional
rights
in
the
states.
with
respect
to
the
sovereign
immunity
issue,
if
the
court
were
to
reach
it,
the...
i
don't
think,
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
before,
that
nevada
v.
hall
establishes
that
guam
could
not...
that
guam
sovereign
immunity
should
not
be
recognized.
nevada
v.
hall
recognized
the
long
tradition
of
comity,
and
recognized
that
the
general
rule
is
that
sovereign
immunity
would
be
recognized
in
the
courts
of
a
different
sovereign.
of
course,
in
the
case
of
nevada
v.
hall,
california
had
specific
reasons
of
policy
relating
to
california's
own
lack
of
sovereign
immunity
that
it
asserts
itself,
and
also
the
fact
that
nevada...
what
was
at
issue
in
the
case
was
a
car
driven
by
someone
from
nevada
in
california,
not
to
apply
sovereign
immunity.
i
don't
think
in
this
case
there
is
any
overriding
policy
concerning
the
application
of
sovereign
immunity.
in
fact,
all
of
the
considerations
are
that
this
court
and
congress--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--if--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
congress
may
have
intended
that
guam
be
treated
as
a
person.
first
of
all,
i
think
the
two
issues
of
sovereign
immunity
and
as
treatment
as
a
person
are
independent.
the
court
said
that,
i
think
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
in
the
will
case,
and
it
said
that
a
number
of
other
times.
in
fact,
in
the
pre-will
cases
where
the
court
held,
for
instance
in
alabama
v.
pugh,
that
a
state
could
be
sued
only
with
its
consent,
it
must
have
been
assuming
at
that
point
that
even
if
a
state
were
a
person
it
would
still
be
entitled
to
a
sovereign
immunity
defense.
and
therefore
it
could
waive
it.
so
i
think
that
they
are
two
independent
issues.
in
addition,
that
would
have
some
bite.
guam
has
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
for
some
purposes,
as
was
pointed
out,
and
guam
could
waive
its...
might
waive
sovereign
immunity
in
such
a
way
as
to
bring
it
within
section
1983,
even
though
it
might
assert
sovereign
immunity
in
other
cases.
