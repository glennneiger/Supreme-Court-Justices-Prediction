ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
here...
here
is
the
retroactivity
of
caldwell
v.
mississippi
to
sawyer's
case.
caldwell
v.
mississippi
cannot
be
applied
retroactively
because
it
is
a
new
rule
of
law
and
it
fits
within...
it
does
not
fit
within
the
second
exception
of
teague
v.
lane.
caldwell
is
a
new
rule
of
law
because
it
extended
the
eighth
amendment
to
an
area
formerly
regulated
by
due
process
and
by
state
law.
before
1985,
no
case
had
addressed
prosecutorial
argument
in
the
light
of
the
eighth
amendment.
prosecutorial
argument
had
always
been
dealt
with
under...
due
process
analysis
or
under
state
law
analysis.
the
prior
cases
of...
from
furman
to
1985
from
this
court
dealt
with
the
eighth
amendment
as
applied
to
procedures
by
which
states
would
impose
a
death
penalty
and
dealt
with
substantive
issues
which
should
go
before
the
jury,
such
as
aggravating
circumstances;
mitigating
circumstances,
jury
instructions
and
things
that
the
court
would
tell
the
jury.
but
never
before
had
argument,
mere
argument,
been
raised
to
the
level
of
the
eighth
amendment
until
caldwell.
now,
we
know
from
this
court,
most
recently
in
boyde
v.
california,
that
argument
is
considered
different
from
jury
instruction
and
evidence,
that
a
jury
is
told
that
they
are
not
to
rest
their
verdict
on
argument
that
mere
argument.
their
verdict
is
to
rest
on
evidence
and
on
jury
instructions.
and
so,
when
we
talk
about
argument,
we
are
talking
about
a
different
entity
from
what
the
cases
had
dealt
with
prior
to
caldwell.
and
there
is
no
federal
case
law
to
have
predicted
or
dictated
the
outcome
in
caldwell
which
applied
the
eighth
amendment
to
prosecutorial
argument.
and
we
know
that
from
caldwell
itself.
if
we
look
at
the
caldwell
opinion,
justice
marshall
used
donnelly
as
a
comparison,
but
then
he
used
state
law
cases
and
the
development
of
analysis
on
prosecutorial
argument
in
the
state
law.
plus,
he
used
the
ada
standards.
but
there
was
no
federal
case
law
for
him
to
use
that
dictated
the
outcome
in
caldwell.
also,
if
we
look
to
the
various
circuits,
such
as
the
tenth
circuit
and
the
fifth
circuit,
the
federal
analysis
up
until
1985
of
prosecutorial
argument
was
under
the
due
process
clause.
even
in
sawyer's
brief
they
cite
no
cases,
no
federal
cases,
which
could
have
predicted
sawyer's
outcome.
nevertheless,
this
court
has
just
recently
told
us
in
butler
v.
mckellar
that
when
we
look
at
a
case
on
federal
habeas,
that
it
is
sounder
to
apply
the
law
that
was
in
place
at
the
time
that
the
conviction
became
final.
sawyer's
conviction
became
final
in
july
of
1983.
in
july
of
1983,
this
court
issued
two
very
critical
opinions
that
are
applicable
to
caldwell
and
sawyer.
that
is,
california
v.
ramos
and
maggio
v.
williams.
now,
california
v.
ramos
is
the
case
where
this
court
sanctioned
the
california
statute
that
okayed
the
governor...
the
information
that
the
governor
could
commute
a
sentence
of
life
in
prison.
this
court
said
that
that
was
not--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--exactly,
and
that
it
was
not
an
arbitrary
factor.
i...
a
state
court
could
have
assumed
that
post-conviction...
in
1983
that
it
was
okay
to
give
the
jury
information
on
post-conviction
procedures.
in
fact,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
caldwell
used
ramos
as
a
reason
to
affirm
that
death
penalty.
it
was
a
four-four
decision.
and
the
four-member
plurality
used
ramos.
the
four--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--oh,
no.
in
caldwell,
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
it
was
a
four-four
decision.
and
the
four
dissenting
justices
did
not
quarrel
with
the
use
of
caldwell.
they
dissented
based
on
state
law.
the
second
case
is
maggio
v.
williams.
and
that
was
the
case
out
of
louisiana
where
the
prosecutor
did
tell
the
jury
about
the
mandatory
statute
that
mandates
an
automatic
direct
appellate
review
of
death
penalty
cases.
he
used...
and
he
used
that
statute
to
tell
the...
to
urge
the
jury
to
vote
for
the
death
penalty.
when
this
court
reviewed
it,
it
issued
a
per
curiam
opinion
and
said
of
the
four
issues
on
that
case,
the
contentions
warrant
little
discussion.
but
in
the
per
curiam
opinion
this
court
did
review...
briefly
review
the
issues,
and
in
response
it
acknowledged
that
the
district
court
had
viewed
the
improper
prosecutorial
arguments
under
the
donnelly...
under
the
donnelly
due
process
and...
despite
the
fact
that
this
could
have
been
dismissed
for
abuse
of
the
writ.
so,
in
1983
this
court
could
have
applied
the
eighth
amendment
to
prosecutorial
argument
and
it
did
not.
and
between
1983
and
1985,
there
were
no
federal
cases
which
predicted
the
outcome
in
caldwell.
and
that's
my
basic
premise
for
arguing
that
caldwell
is
a
new
rule
of
law
if
you
look
at
the
precedents
out
of
this
court
and
out
of
the
federal
circuits
around
the
country
up
until
1985.
the
petitioner
urges
this
court
to
rely
on
the
development
of
the
jurisprudence
in
various
states
in
order
to
say
that
caldwell
is
not
a
new
rule.
if
this
court
would
rely
on
state
court
jurisprudence
developed
based
on
state
law
in
order
to
say
that
caldwell
is
an
old
rule,
that
would
in
itself
would
be
a
new
rule
for
this
court
and
would
be
inapplicable
to
sawyer
here
on
collateral
review.
because
this
court
as...
most
recently
as
dugger
v.
adams,
said
that
the
availability
of
a
claim
under
state
law
does
not
establish
a
claim
that
was
available
under
the
u.s.
constitution.
and
i
submit
to
you
that
the...
all
of
the
state
cases
that
the
petitioner
does
cite
address
improper
argument
based
on
state
law
or
based
on
no
argument
at
all.
that
some
of
the
cases
just
merely
say
this
argument
was
improper
and
they
vacate
the
sentence
or
reverse
the
conviction.
so
that
the
state
law...
if
this
court
says
caldwell
is
an
old
rule
because
of
state
law
jurisprudence,
that
in
itself
would
be
a
new
rule
and
would
be
not
available
to
sawyer
here
on
collateral
review.
i
also
think
that
petitioner
is
misguided
in
using
butler
v.
mckellar
as
a
guidance
that
that
discussion
of
state
cases
in
butler
supports
their
view
of
caldwell
being
an
old
rule.
in
butler
v.
mckellar
this
court
used
the
state
court's
interpretation
of
edwards
v.
arizona.
so,
what
we
have
are
state
courts
interpreting
federal
constitutional
law
and
coming
to
opposite
conclusions.
and
this
court
felt
that
then
robertson
would
be
a
new
law.
but
what
petitioner
has
in
her
brief
are
state
courts
interpreting
state
law
and
coming
to
either
similar
conclusions
or
opposite.
but
what
we
don't
have
for
caldwell
purposes--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--that's
so,
your
honor.
but
those
cases
were
decided
under
a
due
process
analysis,
and
they
were
not
decided--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--under
an
eight
amendment--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--no.
nevertheless,
i
argue
to
this
court
that
this
does
not
qualify
as
a
second
exception,
that
it
is
not
a
watershed
rule
which
implicates
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
trial.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
your
honor,
i
don't...
this
case
here
does
not
rise...
arise
to
the
level
of...
the
argument
here
does
not
rise
to
a
caldwell
violation
level
if
we...
if
you
look
at
the
entire
record.
but--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--i
can...
i
do...
caldwell
is
not
a
watershed
rule.
the
watershed
rules
are
right
to
counsel,
right
to
due
process,
right
to
present
a
defense
and
the
right
to
a
fair
and
an
accurate
trial.
a
fair
trial
not
produced
by
mob
violence.
an
accurate
trial
not
based
on
perjured
testimony.
when
we
look
at
the
sentencing
hearing--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--i
think
a
watershed
rule
has
to
be
essential
to
the
reliability
of
the
outcome
of
that
trial
and
without
which
we
feel
like
you
would
not
have
a
reliable
verdict.
and
my
argument
is
that
a
caldwell...
you...
it's
an
enhancement.
you
could
have
a
caldwell
violation
and
still
have
a
reliable
verdict.
if
i
don't
give
a
defendant
a
right
to
counsel,
then
i
call
into
question
the
reliability
of
that
verdict.
if
i
don't
allow
a
defendant
to
put
forth
a
defense,
the
reliability
of
that
verdict
is
totally
unacceptable.
but
a
caldwell...
you
could
have
a
caldwell
violation
and
still
have
a
reliable
verdict.
it's
an
enhancement.
caldwell
is
a
prophylactic
rule
that
enhances
the
reliability.
it's
a
prophylactic
rule
that
reduces
the
risk
of
unreliability,
where
as
the
right
to
due
process
is...
ensures
the
risk
of
reliability.
a
watershed
rule
is
a
positive
statement
which
ensures
the
risk...
ensures
the
reliability
of
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
caldwell
is
a
prophylactic
rule
that
does
not...
that
reduces
the
risk
of
the
reliability
of
the
trial.
i
liken
it
to
hearsay.
i
think
that
the
hearsay
rule
is
a
good
analogy,
because
in
the
hearsay
rule
we
do
not
let
evidence
in
that
is...
that
has
questionable
reliability.
and
what
is
the
point
of
excluding
hearsay
evidence
but
to
reduce
the
risk
of
an
unreliable
verdict.
and
yet,
we
have
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule.
when
evidence
has
a
high
indicia
of
reliability,
we
allow
it
into...
in
front
of
the
jury,
such
as
business
records.
well,
caldwell
is
the
same
sort
of
rule
designed
to
reduce
the
risk
of
unreliability.
there
could
be
exceptions
to
caldwell.
in
fact,
ramos
gives
us
a
type
of
an
exception
to
a
caldwell-type
comment,
that
we
can
tell
the
jury
something
about
post-conviction
procedures.
when,
in
fact,
we
could--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--it
stands...
you
cannot
mislead
the
jury.
the
information
may
be
improper,
but
it
has
to...
caldwell
says
it
has
to
mislead
the
jury.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
so,
you
have
two
things--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
i
think
caldwell
would
not
necessarily
prohibit
it.
i
think
we
could
give
jurors
accurate
information
regarding
post-conviction
procedures.
and
perhaps--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--probably
not.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
exactly.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
exactly.
i
submit
to
you--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--no,
caldwell
addresses
was
the
jury
misled
as
to
its
role
as
sentencer.
and
i
submit
to
you
one
other
idea
that
could
lead
us
to
a
conclusion
that
caldwell
does
not
fit
within
the
second
exception
and
that
is,
we
could
eliminate
argument
from
the
sentencing
hearing.
eliminate
the
argument,
then
you
wouldn't
even
need
a
caldwell
and
you
could
still
suppose
that
these...
or
believe
that
the
sentencing
hearing,
after
all
the
evidence
is
submitted,
then
we
just
send
the
jury
away
to
make
a
determination
without
argument.
and
that
sentencing
hearing
could
be
still
reliable
even
without
argument.
so--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--yes.
yes.
[laughter]
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
i
do
not
think
this
jury
was
misled.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
i
would
not
condone
some
of
the
things
the
prosecution
said.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
yes,
i
would
agree
that--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--some
of
it
was
misleading.
if
this
court
decides
to
do
a
merits
analysis,
i
have...
i
think
we
have
to
remember
that
several
courts,
including...
five
courts
reviewed
the
merits
of
this
case
and
found
that
this
jury
was
not
misled.
the
louisiana
supreme
court
did
review
this
case
on
direct
review.
under
rule
28,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
is
mandated
to
review
all
sentencing
hearings
for
passion,
prejudice
and
arbitrary
factors.
and
the
supreme
court
did
review
this,
although
it
did
not
address
these
remarks,
in
1982.
that
same
year
the
louisiana
supreme
court
did
reverse
two
other
cases
for
improper
prosecutorial
argument.
so,
i
submit
to
you
that
this
louisiana
supreme
court
in
1982
did
look
at
these
arguments.
in
fact,
it
did
address
on
its
own
the
prosecutor's
reference
to
pardon.
and
in
louisiana,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
made
it
clear
that
in
the
death
sentencing
hearing,
it
is
not
necessary
even
for
the
prosecutor
to
object.
they
will
look
at
anything
and
comb
the
sentencing
hearing
for
any
passion,
prejudice
or
arbitrary
offenses.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
yes,
i
do.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
i'm
sorry.
that
the
defense
counsel
does
not
even
have
to
object
in
order
for
them
to
review
what
they
consider
would
be
passion,
prejudice
or
arbitrary
factors.
so--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--because
it
did
not
rise
to
the
height
of
a...
well,
what
we
call
now
as
a
caldwell
violation.
because
i
think
that
when
you
look
at
the
context
in
which
it
was
said
that
these
remarks
are
not
so
offensive
as
to
reduce...
diminish
the
jury's
sense
of
responsibility.
i
think
the
jurors
were
well
educated
from
the
voir
dire,
from
the
judge's
instructions.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
yes,
i
am.
i
think
that
when
you
look
at
the
comments
they
were
said
in...
in
a
string.
none
of
them
were
focused.
these
comments
were
not
focused.
they
were
said
in
the
midst
of
an
argument.
they
were
said...
references,
brief
references.
no
one
was
told
this
would
be
reviewed.
it
was
said
in
a
string
of
references
in
order
to
encourage
the
jurors
to
believe
that
people
would
support
them
no
matter
what
they
did,
to
alleviate
some
of
their
personal
guilt
for
having
to
make
this
decision.
but
the
prosecutor
did
even
undermine
his
own
statements
by
saying...
so
that
i
contend
that
the
prosecutor
gave
conflicting
remarks.
the
prosecutor
said
things
like
the
decision
is
your
hands.
it
is
a
difficult
decision.
you
will
decide.
so,
i
think
he
undermined
his
own
remarks
that
are
complained
of
here
today.
also,
it's
very
important
that
the
court
did
not
re-enforce
this
argument,
that
the
court
told
these
jurors
before
the
penalty
phase,
that
you...
that
this
will
be
a
binding
recommendation.
the
court
said,
"the
jury
in
a
capital
case
is
given
authority
to
make
a
binding
recommendation
to
the
trial
judge
as
to
the
sentence
that
should
be
imposed.
"
and
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
entire
context
in
which
these
remarks
were
said
and
remember
that
the
judge's
instructions
at
the
end
of
the
guilt
phase,
at
the
end
of
the
penalty
phase,
all
encouraged
the
jurors
to
take
their
role
seriously
and
emphasized
that
they
would
determine,
that
it
was
their
decision
to
make.
and
i
don't
think
that
these
jurors
were
misled
by
the
brief
innocuous
comments
that
this
prosecutor
said.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
no,
i
would
not
agree
to
that.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
in
the
en
banc
opinion,
we
have...
the...
they
review
the
case
for
prejudice
and,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
the
opinion
says,
"if
sawyer
were
able
to
show
actual
prejudice,
he
would
be
able
to
proceed
under
the
more
general
fundamental
fairness
standard
of
donnelly.
"
"yet,
sawyer
has
not
contended
that
such
prejudice
exists
here
and
we,
after
a
thorough
review
of
the
record,
can
find
none.
"
and
i
submit
to
you,
if
they
can
find
no
prejudice
under
donnelly,
then
certainly
they
did
not
find
a
prejudice
under
caldwell,
and
that
we
have
the
panel
decision
which
found
two
to
one
there
was
no
prejudice
under
caldwell.
we
have
a
district
court
judge
found
no
prejudice
under
donnelly
or
caldwell.
and
i
think
there
have
been
plenty...
then
we
have
the
district...
state
district
court
judge
which
found
no
prejudice.
ms.

pendergast
my
understanding
would
be
the
same
as
the
fifth
circuit.
that
it
would
be
like
a...
an
intertwining
of
a
donnelly
fundamental
fairness
error...
i
mean...
excuse
me...
a
fundamental
fairness
analysis
to
decide...
like
where
you
could...
would
compare
the
facts
of
donnelly
and
the
facts
of
caldwell
with
the
facts
of
this
case
and
to
see
if
there
would
be
a
caldwell-type
error.
does
it
reach
to
the
level
of
the
objectionable
elements
of
caldwell?
and
then,
if
it
does...
then,
if
it
does
reach
that
level,
then
we
have
to
have
a
reversal.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
right.
that's
how
i
understand
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
and
i
am
urging
this
court
to
affirm
the
fifth
circuit
opinion.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
excuse
me,
your
honor,
would
you--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--i
think
the
new
aspect
of
the
caldwell
rule
is
the
application
of
eighth
amendment
to
argument,
prosecutorial
argument,
which
is...
it's
such
a
different
entity,
never
would
we
have--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--exactly.
i
think
it's
the
fact
that--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--it's
essential...
it
incorporates
donnelly.
it
incorporates
donnelly
to
decide
if
there
is--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--but
the
new
rule
part
is
that
we
have
never
before
raised
argument
of
counsel
to
the
level
of
an
eighth
amendment
violation.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
exactly.
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
the
test
would
be
different--
ms.
dorothy
a.
pendergast
--my
position
is
that
the
test
is
different
for
an
eighth
amendment
violation,
and
that
we
go
to...
once
we
find
that
there
is
this
error,
then
there
is
no
test
for
prejudice
and
that
would
be
the
difference
in
a
caldwell.
specifically...
and
that's
what
makes
caldwell
a
new
rule,
because
the
eighth
amendment
demands
a
heightened
scrutiny
and
the
reliability
that
this
sentence
of
death
is
the
appropriate
sentence
for
this
defendant
in
these
circumstances
for
this
crime.
