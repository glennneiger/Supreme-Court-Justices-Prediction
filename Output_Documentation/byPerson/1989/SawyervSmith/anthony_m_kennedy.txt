justice
kennedy
was
the
donnelly
case
relied
upon
in
the
proceedings
in
the
louisiana
court
on
direct
review?
justice
kennedy
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
any
of
our
cases
in
the
capital
sentencing
area
in
recent
years
that
are
not
fundamental?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
as
you
look
back
over
our
jurisprudence,
it
seems
to
me
that
most
of
them
would
fit
within
the
guidelines
you've
just
suggested.
and
if
that's
so,
teague's
a
dead
letter.
justice
kennedy
in...
in
this
case
to...
to
affirm
the
conviction?
justice
kennedy
and...
and
in
your
view,
is
that
the
new
aspect
of
the...
of
caldwell
rule?
justice
kennedy
in
your
view,
is...
is
that
the
new
aspect
of
the
caldwell
rule?
justice
kennedy
you
mean
it's
simply...
it's
simply
the...
the...
the
constitutional
source
of
the
rule,
but
not
its
application?
justice
kennedy
in
application
it's
essentially
the
same
as
donnelly?
justice
kennedy
well,
that
sounds
to
me
like
an
old
rule.
