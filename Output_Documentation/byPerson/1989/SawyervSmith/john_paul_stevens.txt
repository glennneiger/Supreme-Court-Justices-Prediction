stevens
you
don't
think
that...
well,
that
isn't
the
question
i
asked.
maybe
the
jury
wasn't
because
of
the
instructions
that
came
in
later.
but
the
argument
itself
was
misleading,
would
you
not
agree?
justice
stevens
i
know
you
wouldn't
condone
it,
but
would
you
agree
it
was
misleading?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
