ms.
hancock--
justice
blackmun
--was
the
claim
you're
advancing
now
ever
raised
in
the
state
courts?
justice
blackmun
so,
you
feel
that
the...
any
requirement
of
raising
the
point
on
the
state
side
first
has
been
satisfied?
justice
blackmun
i
know
it
hasn't.
justice
blackmun
i'm
a
little
surprised
the
state
hasn't
raised
it,
but
apparently
they
don't
want
to
rely
on
it.
justice
blackmun
well,
that
has
to
be
your
argument,
of
course.
and
yet
it
is
ironic,
isn't
it,
that
today
the
rule
would
be
the
other
way?
and
here's
a
capital
case.
justice
blackmun
well,
i
have
looked
at
the
entire
record,
and
i
think
i
disagree
with
you
mildly
on
that
one.
justice
blackmun
would
you
agree
that
every
judge
on
the
fifth
circuit
felt
there
was
a
caldwell
violation?
justice
blackmun
and
explain
it
for
me.
