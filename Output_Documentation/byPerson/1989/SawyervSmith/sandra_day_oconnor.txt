justice
o'connor
--ms.
hancock,
i...
i
take
it
you
concede
that
all
the
cases
that
you
say
foreshadowed
caldwell
were
indeed
state
law
cases.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
were
there
any
cases
or
do
you
cite
any
cases
that
relied
on
the
eighth
amendment
as
a
ground
for
the
result
reached
in
caldwell?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
hancock,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
address
the
effect
of
this
court's
per
curiam
in
maggio
against
williams,
decided
in
1983,
in
which
the
court
summarily
rejected
a
claim
just
like
this.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
makes
it
very
hard
to
say
that
caldwell
is
not
a
new
rule
in...
at
least
in...
in
the
view
of
this
court.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
you
say
that
every
capital
sentencing
procedure
that
reduces
the
risk
of
an
unreliable
determination
falls
within
the
second
example?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
does
seem
your
argument
would
sweep--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
a
great
many
of
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
the
criminal
procedure
rulings
and
i
think
that
has
to
be
a
matter
of
concern.
and,
in
any
event,
in
this
particular
area,
you
certainly...
a
defendant
can
fall
back
on
the
donnelly
due
process
claim
if
something
is
truly
fundamentally
unfair.
isn't
that
true?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
all
of
that
lends
support
to
the
notion
that
it's
certainly
articulated
a
new
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
pendergast,
there
certainly
is
an
impressive
array
of
cases
from
state
courts
showing
a
long
history
of
condemnation
of
false
and
misleading
prosecutorial
arguments
that
diminish
the
jury's
sense
of
responsibility.
isn't
that
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--does
it
indicate
that
at
least
the
caldwell
rule
comes
close
to
being
essential
to
fundamentally
fair
proceedings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
tend
to
say
that
a
rule
essential
to
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
proceeding
could
be
a
watershed
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
do
you
suppose
here
it
was
that
the
state
court
did
not
give
relief
to
the
defendant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
are...
you
are
making
the
argument
that
even
assuming
it
would
rise
to
the
level
of
a
caldwell
violation
in
our
view,
that
the
defendant
should
not
get
relief?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
means
the
rule
isn't
the
same,
that
just
labelling
it
eighth
amendment
isn't
the
answer.
that,
in
fact,
the
test
is
different.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
your
position?
