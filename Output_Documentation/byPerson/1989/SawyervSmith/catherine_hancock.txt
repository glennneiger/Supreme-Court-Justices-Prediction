ms.
catherine
hancock
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
the
petitioner,
robert
sawyer,
and
i'll
be
reserving
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
robert
sawyer
is
here
today
seeking
a
resentencing
hearing
as
a
remedy
for
his
prosecutor's
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment
which
occurred
when
the
prosecutor
made
repeated
references
during
closing
argument
to
the
fact
that
the
jury's
decision
was
not
final,
was
reviewable
and
ultimately
would
be
corrected
on
appeal.
robert
sawyer
was
on
the
verge
of
receiving
the
relief
for
the
caldwell
violation
in
his
case
from
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
en
banc
when
teague
v.
lane
was
decided,
and
the
question
of
caldwell's
retroactivity
was
raised.
we
submit
that
this
court
should
find
that
caldwell
does
apply
retroactively
to
this
case
under
teague
and
that
the
court
should
grant
a
re-sentencing
hearing,
because
the
caldwell
violation
in
this
case
was
worse
than
in
the
caldwell
case
itself.
here,
for
example,
there
were
four
episodes
of
repeated
argument.
it
appears
almost
to
be
calculated
argument.
ms.
catherine
hancock
your
honor,
in
caldwell
the
context
was
that
the
prosecutor
stood
up
in
response
to
defense
counsel
and
said,
what
the
defense
counsel's
telling
you
is
not
true,
it's
automatically
reviewable,
your
decision
is
not
final.
your
honor
is
correct
that
following
those
statements,
the
judge
did
affirm
the
truth
of
what
the
prosecutor
was
saying.
so,
it
was
a
combined
violation.
ms.
catherine
hancock
no,
your
honor.
ms.
catherine
hancock
no,
your
honor,
defense
counsel
did
not
object.
in
this
case,
the
caldwell
violations
are
revealed
on
page
3
and
4
of
our
brief
where
we
cite
from
the
transcript
of
a
closing
argument.
specifically,
the
messages
came
across
as
follows.
the
jury
was
told,
you
yourself
will
not
be
sentencing
robert
sawyer
to
the
electric
chair.
what
you
are
saying
to
this
court,
to
any
appellate
court,
to
the
supreme
court
of
this
state,
to
the
supreme
court
possibly
of
the
united
states,
is
that
you
are
of
the
opinion
that
this
is
the
type
of
crime
that
deserves
the
penalty.
it
is
merely
a
recommendation.
in
the
second
episode
of
argument,
the
prosecutor
said,
you
are
the
people
who
are
going
to
take
the
initial
step
and
only
the
initial
step.
all
you
are
saying
to
all
the
judges
who
are
going
to
review
this
case
is
that
this
man
could
be
prosecuted.
no
more,
nor
less.
finally,
your
honor,
in
the
third
episode
of
argument,
the
prosecutor
reached
the
level
described
in
the
caldwell
dissent
where
the
court
in
dissent
said...
the
dissenter
said,
if
you
go
so
far
as
to
tell
the
jury
that
the
appellate
court's
going
to
correct
them
if
they're
wrong,
then
that
is
the
most
severe
kind
of
violation
imaginable.
and
even
the
dissent
was
willing
to
recognize
that
kind
of
statement
would
violate
the
constitution.
it
was
in
this
third
episode
where
the
prosecutor
said,
don't
feel
like
you're
the
one.
it
is
very
easy
for
defense
lawyers
to
make
each
and
every
one
of
you
feel
like
you
are
pulling
the
switch.
that
is
not
so.
it
is
not
so,
and
if
you
are
wrong
in
your
decision,
believe
me...
believe
me,
there
will
be
others
who
will
be
behind
you
to
either
agree
with
you
or
to
say
you
are
wrong.
finally,
the
last
words
the
jury
heard
from
the
prosecutor
in
the
second
rebuttal
closing
argument
were
as
follows:
i
ask
that
you
recommend
because
all
you
are
doing
is
making
a
recommendation.
i
ask
that
you
recommend
to
this
court
and
to
any
other
court
that
reviews
robert
sawyer's
case
that,
as
a
jury,
you
recommend
death
penalty.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
situation
where
caldwell's
elements
are
met
and
an
important
starting
point
for
understanding
why
caldwell
is
old
law
and
is,
therefore,
retroactive
is
to
look
at
those
caldwell
elements.
it
is
also
important
to
recognize
there
are
times
when
this
court
sits...
often,
i
suppose...
to
decide
constitutional
conflicts.
there
are
also
times,
more
rare,
when
this
court
sits
to
ratify
what
state
courts
perceived
to
be
constitutional
requirements.
caldwell
is
a
ratification
case.
ms.
catherine
hancock
counsel
in
the
ramos
decision...
but
this
court
noted
that
in
looking
at
state
court
cases
in
the
death
penalty
context,
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
discern
whether
those
cases
are
based
on
state
law
that
is
a
narrow
kind
of
state
law
or
state
law
that
is
informed
by
federal
principles.
your
honor,
we
believe
that
it
should
be
sufficient
under
this
court's
decisions
on
retroactivity,
sufficient
evidence
should
be
provided
by
state
court
decisions
that
are
informed
by
federal
principles,
that
those
courts
were
indeed--
ms.
catherine
hancock
--i
can...
the
georgia
and
the
louisiana
cases
do
cite
eighth
amendment
cases
in
their
decisions,
as
does
the
mississippi
court.
the
mississippi
court
cites
ramos,
for
example.
the
georgia
and
louisiana
states
describe
what
they
believe
to
be
their
standard
of
review,
which
is
they
have
to
look
for
arbitrary
factors
under
the...
mandate
in
gregg.
your
honor,
it
should
not
be
surprising
that
in
the
late
'70s
and
the
early
'80s
state
courts
were
writing
the
kinds
of
opinions
they
were
in
these
cases.
perhaps
today
one
might
look
for
a
different
pattern
or
demand
a
different
pattern.
but
with
regard
to
the
caldwell
problem,
there
was
a
rich
tradition
of
pre-furman
death
penalty
law.
thus,
any
state
court
in
the
late
'70s
or
early
'80s
would
not
only
be
looking
to
this
court's
eighth
amendment
decisions
but
would
naturally
as
a
source
of
first
resort
being...
rely
on
those
pre-furman
decisions.
one
has
to
think
about
how
state
courts
write
death
penalty
decisions
in
order
to
understand
why
it
would
be
so
natural
for
them
to
rely
on
what
is
essentially
state
court
decision
making
with
many
different
sources
being
used,
including
eighth
amendment.
but
not
exclusively
the
eighth
amendment
and
not
just
treating
it
as
though
there
were
no
solution
to
this
problem
other
than
purely
the
eighth
amendment.
ms.
catherine
hancock
yes?
ms.
catherine
hancock
it
was
not
raised
in
the
state
direct
appeal
where
petitioner
was
represented
by
different
counsel,
your
honor.
it
was
raised
in
state
post-conviction
claim
5
of
our
habeas
petition.
it
was
rejected
when
the
supreme
court
denied
our
writ
by
a
vote
of
four
to
three
without
opinion...
the
louisiana
supreme
court.
ms.
catherine
hancock
yes,
the
state
has
not
argued.
ms.
catherine
hancock
yes.
right.
the
state
v.
willie,
and
other
louisiana
cases,
affirm
the
louisiana
court's
willingness
to
entertain--
ms.
catherine
hancock
--yes,
the
louisiana
law
appears
clearly
to
find...
to
not
use
any
kind
of
procedural
default
doctrine
in
this
area
of
the
law,
your
honor.
ms.
catherine
hancock
not
to
my
recollection,
your
honor.
in
order--
ms.
catherine
hancock
--yes?
ms.
catherine
hancock
your
honor,
the
lines
of
authority
we
rely
on...
and
please
tell
me
if
this
is
not
responsive...
but
the
lines
of
authority
we
rely
on
are
two.
the
compulsion
coming
down
upon
the
state
courts
is
coming
from
zant
v.
stephens,
the
ramos
decision,
decisions
which
focus
on
the
unacceptability
of
false
information.
it's
not
a
question
of
the
jury
relying
on
somebody,
one
actor
or
another,
but
false
information
being
interjected
into
the
jury's
deliberations.
and
that
false
information
was
clearly
something
a
state
court
would
have
regarded
as
unacceptable.
those
decisions
suggest
that
false
information
makes
it...
would
make
a
jury's
verdict
unreliable.
then
we
have
a
second
line.
the
caldwell
problem
stands
where
two
doctrines...
where
two
lines
of
authority
converge.
that
second
line
is
the
lockett
and
eddings
cases
which
suggest
that
a
sentencer,
namely
the
jury
here,
cannot
be
precluded
from
considering
mitigating
evidence
fully,
as
is
their
responsibility.
so,
it
is
those
two
lines
of
authority
upon
which
we
rely.
in
looking
at
the
substance
of
the
caldwell
rule,
it
is
important
to
note
that
it
is
a
narrow
one.
it
is
a
narrow
rule
for
a
rare
problem.
it
is
the
rare
prosecutor
who
engages
in
argument,
such
as
the
argument
that
one
finds
in
this
case
which
was
clearly
prohibited
under
aba
standards.
indeed,
if
this
court
were
to
look
at
grants
of
caldwell
relief
since
caldwell
and
before
caldwell,
this
court
would
find
that
it
is
the
rare
prosecutor
who
engages
in
this
error.
the
narrow
rule
that
is
created
to
solve
this
narrow
problem
is
as
follows.
the
statements
must
be
false
and
misleading.
the
statements
need
to
refer
to
the
non-finality
of
the
jury's
verdict,
to
go
to
the
heart
of
the
jury's
function
to
talk
about
the
jury's
decision-making
power
not
being
final.
a
highly
specialized
kind
of
argument.
third,
and
perhaps
most
important,
those
statements
must
be
focused,
unambiguous
and
strong.
and,
finally,
they
must
uncorrected.
it
is
possible
that
if
they...
if
they
are
corrected,
that...
that
even
these
kinds
of
statements
will
be
regarded
as
ones
which
have
been
taken
care
of.
if
one
thinks
about
the
narrow
contours
of
the
rule,
several
features
of
caldwell
are
revealed.
it
is...
caldwell
error,
this
is...
highly
damaging.
a
prejudicial...
a
prejudice
test
is
in
effect
built
into
the
rule
itself,
unlike
other
rules.
ms.
catherine
hancock
your
honor,
defense
counsel
in
this
case,
as
the
record
shows,
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
in
its
panel
opinion
revealed--
ms.
catherine
hancock
--yes,
that's
right,
but
not
this
part
of
it.
ms.
catherine
hancock
no,
i
merely
want
to
illustrate
the
answer
to
your
honor's
question,
which
i
could
directly
answer
better
by
saying
that--
ms.
catherine
hancock
--the
defense
lawyer
was
not
competent,
your
honor.
he
was
only
out
of
law
school
a
few
years.
he
was
unqualified
under
state
law
to
represent
mr.
sawyer.
he
waived
his
guilt-phase
closing
argument.
he
made
a
one-page
closing
argument
at
the
sentencing
phase.
your
honor,
this
court
is
not
here
today
to
decide
the--
ms.
catherine
hancock
--well,
your
honor,
it
may
surprise
you,
but
state
cases
before
caldwell
did
sometimes
involve
this
fact
pattern
where
a
prosecutor
would
make
these
misleading
statements.
no
objection
would
happen.
the
state
courts
would
condemn
the
error
and
reverse.
this
is
not
a
aberrational
or
exceptional
case.
and
in
this
case,
your
honor,
there
can
be
no
fear
of
sandbagging
or
of
strategy.
the
record
shows
plainly
that
this
was
a
young
inexperienced
lawyer
who
made
many
mistakes
and
this
was
one
of
them.
now,
if
you
think
about
the
features
of
the
caldwell
rule,
false
and
misleading,
focused,
unambiguous
and
strong,
relating
to
the
jury's
responsibility,
highly
damaging,
clearly
this
is
error
that
is
avoidable.
error
like
this
is
not
something
prosecutors
will
stray
into,
bump
into
in
the
heat
of
argument.
this
prosecutor
went
over
into
that
forbidden
zone
and
stayed
there.
and--
ms.
catherine
hancock
--yes--
ms.
catherine
hancock
--well,
counsel...
i
mean,
your
honor,
an
answer
to
that
question
is
provided
by
a
glance
at
the
district
court's
opinion
in
that
case.
if
you
look
at
the
district
court's
opinion
what
you
discover
is
the
counsel
in
that
case
made
a
donnelly
claim.
in
other
words,
the
argument
in
that
particular
case
was
very
specifically
that
it
was
unfair,
that
it
was
inflammatory,
that
he
made
statements
that
were
not
allowed
to
be
made
under
the
scope
of
state
law,
the
code
of
criminal
procedure.
and
he
added...
blended,
if
you
will...
the
kind
of
inarticulate
seed
of
a
caldwell
claim
by
saying,
well,
and
it
also
lessened
the
jury's
responsibility.
then
that
particular
claim
was
abused,
but
the
district
court
went
ahead
and
considered
it.
and
this
court
held
in
the
per
curiam
opinion
that
it
was
really
too
late
for
this
counsel
to
be
bringing
up
another
claim
which
had
been
abused
and,
moveover,
the
district
court
acted
properly
in
relying
on
donnelly,
as
he
did.
and
i
believe
the
district
court
did
act
properly
because
that's
the
way
the
counsel
painted
it.
it
would
not
be
appropriate
to
allow
counsel
to...
to
make
a
claim
that
was
really
not
made.
it
was
justice
stevens
in
concurrence,
who
acting
as
perhaps
defense
counsel,
might
have
or
should
have,
noticed
the...
the
seeds
of
a
caldwell
error,
which
in
fact
was
at
that
time
well
established
under
all
these
state
court
precedents,
was
something
that
would
be
condemned.
when
faced
with
the
narrow
problem
of
caldwell
error,
state
courts
responded
in
the
pre-furman
era
and
in
the
post-furman
era
responded
dramatically
by
condemning
these
kinds
of
arguments.
they
used
the
same
reasoning
that
was
later
adopted
as
caldwell
itself.
after
furman,
state
courts,
mostly
in
the
south,
gave
the
same
answer.
they
would
not
tolerate
this
kind
of
argument
in
a
capital
case.
we
have
georgia
and
south
carolina
in
1975...
pardon
me,
north
carolina.
we
have
south
carolina
and
louisiana
in
1970
and
1980.
maryland,
mississippi,
kentucky,
oklahoma,
more
and
more
states
join
this
group.
and
these
states,
in
their
opinions,
relied
on
pre-furman
death
penalty
law
logically,
as
well
as
on
eighth
amendment
principles.
they
had
two
sources
driving
them
toward
the
caldwell
rule.
if
you
are
wondering
how
one
can
tell
when
state
court
decisions
are
informed
by
federal
principles,
we
would
suggest
two
indicia
which
might
be
persuasive.
first,
when
state
courts
actually
cite
directly
eighth
amendment
precedence,
that
suggests
that
they
are
cognizant
of
the
eighth
amendment
principles
and
taking
them
into
account
and
believe
that
they
support
the
result.
and
further,
and
most
intriguingly,
the
use
of
these
state
court
cases
that
were
decided
before
caldwell,
when
they
come
after
caldwell,
they
are
treated
interchangeably
with
the
caldwell
opinion
by
the
states.
it's
unusual,
i
would
submit,
for
a
state
to
treat
its
own
decisions
as
though
they
were
illustrations
of
a
problem
that
was
made
up
of
eighth
amendment
law
unless
they
really
believe
that
those
were
the...
equal
in
significance,
the
same
kind
of
decision,
the
same
kind
of
law.
your
honor,
with
regard
to
caldwell,
some
of
the
characteristics
which
explain
why
caldwell
is
old
law
also
suggest
strongly
that
caldwell
belongs
in
that
small
catalogue
of
rights
under
teague
which
deserve
retroactive
application
as
bedrock
rights.
while
it
is...
may
usually
be
true
that
teague's
second
exception
was
reserved
for
rights
which
are
new,
in
fact,
it's
perfectly
possible
that
a
right
that
is
very
old
may
also
be
fundamental
enough
for
teague.
and
we
submit
there
are
two
main
reasons
that
caldwell
should
belong
in
this
bedrock
rights
category,
as
the
aba
has
suggested
and
as
we
argue.
first,
teague
did
establish
some
guidelines
for
bedrock
rights.
those
guidelines
reveal
that
this
court
will
look
to
see
whether
a
right
has
emerged
over
the
years.
caldwell
is
one
of
those
rare
eighth
amendment
rights
which
did
emerge
and
there
was
a
powerful
state
consensus
supporting
it.
second,
teague's
guidelines
focus
on
a
few
cases,
cases
that
the
teague
court
suggest
belong
in
the
category,
and
caldwell
is
similar
to
those
kinds
of
cases,
such
as
the
mooney
case.
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
the
teague
opinion
stressed
with
regard
to
bedrock
rights
the
significance
of
the
liability
and
accuracy
as
the
sort
of
the
touchstone
of
the
bedrock-right
category.
ms.
catherine
hancock
well,
your
honor,
that's
a
tough
question
since
you've
decided
many
cases
and
this
is
the
first
case
to
raise
this
question.
ms.
catherine
hancock
i
think,
on
the
contrary,
your
honor,
that
teague
is
not
at
all
a
dead
letter,
that
teague's
demands
are
quite
difficult
to
meet.
and
there
are
examples
of
rights
which
this
court
might
well
find
to
be
important,
something
that
is
necessary
to
a
capital
sentencing
process,
but
not
going
to
the
heart
of
reliability.
and--
ms.
catherine
hancock
--your
honor,
that's
a
very
difficult
question
to
answer
because
whenever
this
court
writes
eighth
amendment
opinions
upholding
defendant's
rights,
it
is
common
for
that
to
be
said
about
the
right,
that
they
reduce
the
risk
of
unreliability.
however,
that
means
that
if
the
question
to
your
honor's
question
is
yes,
then
you
have,
and
i
have
just
accepted,
a
per
se...
shall
we
say
carte
blanche...
validation
of
all
eighth
amendment
rights
into
teague.
and
i
don't
think
that
either
teague
or
penry
suggests
that
sweeping
categorical
judgments
based
on
one
line
in
an
opinion
would
be
enough.
our
position
here
is
much
narrower
today.
we
would
suggest
that...
that
the
teague
inquiry
should
be
conducted
a
case
at
a
time.
and
one
really
has
to
think
about
the
eighth
amendment
right
in
question.
what
does
it
do?
what
function
does
it
serve?
how
close
is
it--
ms.
catherine
hancock
--oh--
ms.
catherine
hancock
--well--
ms.
catherine
hancock
--yes.
let
me
address
your
honor's
first
observation
and
then
speak
about
donnelly.
your
first
observation,
may
i
answer
and
say
that
we
are
not
making
a
sweeping
argument.
we
are
not
seeking
to
have
the
words
reliability
in
an
opinion
be
the
touchstone
to
a
teague
solution.
rather,
we
are
arguing
that
caldwell
is
almost
unique,
one
of
a
small
number
of
possible
cases,
because
it
has
these
features.
it
has
already
emerged
right
out
of
skipper.
one
can
think
of
other
examples
recently.
those
rights
are
not
as
ancient
as
caldwell.
finding
1877
support
for
some
of
this
court's
eighth
amendment
rights
is
not
automatically
going
to
happen.
with
regard
to
donnelly,
your
honor,
donnelly
was
really
the
case
that
distracted
and
misled
the
fifth
circuit
majority
blow.
and
yet...
and
it
is
true
that
donnelly
and
caldwell
do
overlap.
there
are
defendants
who
will
be
able
to
make
claims
under
both
categories.
however,
the
cases
deal
with
vastly
different
problems.
donnelly
relied
on
the...
so
in
fact
the
trial
as
to
violate
due
process
standard,
which
was
not
unique
to
closing
argument.
that
was
the
standard
of
this
court
used
again
and
again
for
due
process
violations
with
regard
to
jury
instructions,
the
admission
of
evidence.
it
was
the
garden
variety
due
process
expression
of
the
test
that
this
court
uses
whenever
an
error
is
committed
and
the
impact
of
that
error
needs
to
be
weighed
in
light
of
the
entire
case.
a
donnelly
situation
involving
a
prosecutor,
your
honor,
can
happen
in
any
case.
the
prosecutor
can
stray
into
an
error,
talk
about
something
outside
the
record,
say
something
bad
about
the
defendant,
and
surely
the
due
process
test
is
appropriate
for
that
kind
of
error
for
the
same
reason
it
fits
all
other
traditional
errors
in
all
criminal
cases.
the
caldwell
test
is
for
a
different
problem,
a
problem
that
is
avoidable,
a
rare
error,
and
the
caldwell
test
has
a
special
prejudice
component
built
into
it.
it
must
be
false
and
misleading,
focused,
unambiguous
and
strong,
et
cetera.
ms.
catherine
hancock
no,
your
honor,
superficially
one
might
think
that
that
is
the
case.
but
interestingly
enough,
donnelly
was
not
the
basis
for
analysis
that
state
courts
used
when
they
were
perceiving
the
caldwell
error.
in
other
words,
donnelly
is
a
fair
trial
standard.
by
the
time
furman
came
down...
and
surely
after
gregg
and
in
lockett
and
eddings
and
all
the
other
eighth
amendment
precedence
upon
which
we
rely...
donnelly
standard
is
not
in
use.
and
the
state
courts
are
properly
not
even
considering
it.
your
honor,
we
submit
that
the
fifth
circuit
might
very
well...
the
majority
might
very
well
have
thought
of
donnelly
itself
because
they
seem
to
decide
donnelly
claims
commonly
coming
up
out
of
state
courts.
whereas
the
caldwell
problem
only
comes
along
every
once
in
awhile.
state
courts
perceived
that
donnelly
and
caldwell
treated
very
different
problems
and
required
very
different
solutions.
thank
you,
your
honor,
i'll
speak
later.
ms.
catherine
hancock
first,
your
honor,
the...
the
date
of
final
conviction
is
this
case
was
april
2nd,
1984.
the
fifth
circuit
unanimously
treated
that
as
the
date
properly
under
teague.
that
was
the
date
cert.
was
denied.
the
state
here
suggests
that
the
date
should
be
july.
if
that
were
to
be
true,
this
court
would
have
to
hold
that
when
cert.
is
granted
and
a
judgment
is
vacated,
that's
not
a...
somehow
that's
a
final
conviction.
teague
sensibly
uses
the
cert.
denied
date,
because
it
provides
a
bright-line
boundary
for
the
last
opportunity
for
review
of
federal
questions
following
a
state
appeal.
now,
ramos
was
decided
the
same
day
that
the
conviction
was
final.
second,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
darden
case
in
a
footnote
recognized
the
dramatic
difference
between
caldwell
error
and
donnelly
error.
this
court
established
a
wall
between
the
two
doctrines,
recognizing
the
unique
aspects
of
caldwell.
essentially
the
state's
argument
would
do
away
with
that
wall,
would
blend
back
by
various
means
the
donnelly
analysis
into
a
caldwell
inquiry,
whether
by
modifying
the
correction
standard
or
by
other
means.
the
fifth
circuit
made
a
mistake
that
really
was
based
on
its
belief
that
caldwell
added
something
to
donnelly.
with
all
due
respect
for
the
fifth
circuit
majority,
caldwell
dealt
with
a
problem
that
was
an
old
capital
sentencing
problem.
donnelly
dealt
with
a
problem
that
was
a
generic,
fair
trial,
every
kind
of
case
problem
and
when
caldwell
came
down,
it
ratified
and
echoed
the
consensus
of
what
the
rule
should
be
for
this
old
capital
sentencing
problem.
thus,
caldwell
didn't
add
something
to
donnelly.
it
reinforced
a
particular
line
of
thought
about
a
particular
problem,
and
it
was
really
in
some
ways
a
coincidence
that
the
two
cases
dealt
with
closing
argument.
finally,
your
honor,
on
the
merits
we
submit
that
we
have
met
the
caldwell
standard,
the
caldwell
formula,
which
is
strict
and
demanding,
that
we
are
similar
to
those
rare
cases
where
relief
has
been
granted.
and
we
seek
to
have
this
court
reaffirm
caldwell,
reaffirm
that
wall
between
the
doctrines
and
grant
a
re-sentencing
hearing
where
a
verdict
may
be
determined
by
a
jury
that
is
not
misled
about
its
sentencing
responsibilities.
thank
you.
