chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
89-5809,
sawyer
against
smith.
ms.
hancock,
we
will
wait
just
a
minute
until
the
court
clears,
very
well
ms.
hancock,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in...
in
caldwell
the
bad
statements
came
from
a
judge,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
here
did
the
judge
say
anything?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
defense
counsel
object
to
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if...
if
this
was
so
highly
damaging,
ms.
hancock,
why
didn't
the
defense
lawyer
object
when
it
was
made?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--which
has
been
superseded,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
the...
the
panel
opinion
remains
dispositive
of
the
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
don't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
but
you
would
think
if
this
is
such
a
terribly
damaging
thing,
even
a
relatively
unskilled
lawyer
would
object
to
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
hancock.
ms.
pendergast,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we...
we
said
it
didn't
violate
the
federal
constitution.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
does...
does
caldwell
stand
for
anything
more
than
the
proposition
that
the
information
may
not
be
misleading?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--so
if
you
want
to
bring
something
under
the
head
of
caldwell,
i
would...
i
would
think
you
would
have
to
show
that
the
information
is...
is
inaccurate
or
false.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so
that
if
one
refers
to...
to
some
further
proceeding,
and
there
is
such
a
further
proceeding,
that
information
would...
would
not
be
prohibited
by
caldwell?
chief
justice
rehnquist
at
least...
if
there
was
any
constitutional
objection
to
it,
it
would
not
be
because
of
a
caldwell
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
for
the
defense
counsel
to
object,
don't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
just
said
prosecutor.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
your
understanding
of
the
difference
between
the
prejudice
inquiry
under
donnelly
and
under
caldwell?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
there
is...
if
it
reaches
that
level,
as
you
understand
it,
then
there
isn't
a
further
inquiry
as
to
prejudice?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
isn't
a
new
consequence
of
caldwell
that
if
there
is
a
caldwell
violation,
there
is
no
further
prejudice
inquiry.
if
there
is...
in
donnelly
there
is
a
prejudice
inquiry.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
pendergast.
ms.
hancock,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
pendergast.
the
case
is...
oh,
pardon
me,
ms.
hancock.
the
case
is
submitted.
