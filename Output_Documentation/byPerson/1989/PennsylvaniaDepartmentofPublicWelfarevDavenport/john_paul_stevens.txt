is
there
any
case
law
supporting
your
position?
justice
stevens
but
there
is
some
to
the
contrary.
is
there
case
law
to
the
contrary
in
pennsylvania?

xxx
preferences?
justice
stevens
mr.
searles,
before
you
get
into
your
argument,
could
you
help
me
out
on
one...
this
is
not
a
bankruptcy,
this
is
a
chapter
13,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
it
reads
more
like
a
reorganization.
justice
stevens
now,
what
is
the
difference
between
the...
your
client's
obligation
under
the
plan
of...
whatever
the
plan
he
had
was,
and
his
obligation
had
there
been
no
plan?
he
did
have
an
obligation
to
pay
it
even
under
the
plan,
didn't
he?
justice
stevens
yeah,
well,
what--
justice
stevens
--well,
why
d...
why
doesn't
the
state
get
paid
in
full
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
but
if
they
had
filed
a
claim,
wouldn't
they
have
been
paid
in
full?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
but
if,
for
example,
this
was
the
only
debt
he
had...
or
assuming
its
a
debt
for...
i
don't
suppose
they
would
approve
of
the
plan
if...
if
it
was
just
a
means
to
get
rid
of
this
one
obligation,
would
they?
it
would
either
be
a
bankruptcy
case
or
nothing,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
isn't
there
a
good
faith
requirement?
justice
stevens
isn't
there
a
good
faith
requirement?
justice
stevens
well,
if
his...
if
his
filings
were
correct...
i'm
sorry
i
shouldn't...
if
his
filings
were
correct,
he
really
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
pay
this
money
anyway
then,
would
he?
justice
stevens
on
the
schedule.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
there
is
a
big
difference
it
seems
to
me,
because
if
in
many
of
these
cases
the
only
substantial
debt
is
the
one
for
restitution
or
something
like
that,--
justice
stevens
--i
see.
justice
stevens
i
see.
and
in
those
cases...
if
it...
if
it
were,
as
i
supposed,
the
main
obligation
was
the
restitution,
then
they
simply
wouldn't
get
in
bankruptcy
court
at
all,
is
what
would
happen
if
the
states
win.
justice
stevens
no,
if
the
states
win
in
this...
in
this
case.
then
in
cases
where
the
main
obligation
of
the...
of
the
bankrupt
or
the
debtor
is
the
restitution
obligation,
there
would
be
no
point
in
going
into
bankruptcy
court.
so
you
just
wouldn't
have
these
bankruptcy
proceedings.
justice
stevens
but
you
say
that
that
really
is
not
the
fact.
that
there's
lots
of
these
in
which
there's
an
ongoing
obligation
on
a
car
or
a
house
or
something.
justice
stevens
i
see.
