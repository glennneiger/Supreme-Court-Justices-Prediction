chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
89-156,
pennsylvania
department
of
public
welfare
v.
edward
j.
davenport.
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--because
there
is
no
contemporary
consideration
paid
for
each
of
the
installments,
is
that
why
it
is
voidable?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
can
ask
him
in
conference.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
asking
you
now.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
it's
not
all
debts
that
are
preferences.
i
mean
if
a
payment
is
made
on
a
debt
within
90
days,
the
reason
it's
a
preference
is
because
there's
nothing
exchanged
for
the
time.
it's
a
pre-existing
debt.
isn't
that
the
reason?
chief
justice
rehnquist
as
a
matter
of
fact,
mr.
cohen,
in
pennsylvania
is
restitution
often
imposed
as
the
only
criminal
sanction
or
is
it
usually
accompanied
by
a
fine
or
a...
or
a
criminal
sentence?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
if...
if
the
third
circuit
view
prevails,
the
pennsylvania
criminal
court
would
have
difficulty
revoking
probation
for
failure
to
pay
the
restitution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why...
why
would
ability
to
pay
be
critical
in
deciding
whether
or
not
because
the...
it's
dischargeable
in
bankruptcy,
you
could
nonetheless
revoke
probation
for
failure
to
pay
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
okay.
but
that's
a
totally
different
line
of
cases
from...
from
the
bankruptcy
aspect.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
there
was
a
determination
that
the
defendant
did
have
the
ability
to
pay,
but
nonetheless
the
third
circuit's
view
is
upheld
here
and
we
say
this
is
a
debt
dischargeable
in
bankruptcy.
do
you
think
the
pennsylvania
criminal
court
could
revoke
probation
for
failure
to
pay
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--yes,
you
may,
mr.
cohen.
mr.
searles.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
searles,
if
the
third
circuit
view
is
upheld
here,
do
you
think
that
a
pennsylvania
criminal
court
could
revoke
this
particular
respondents'
probation
for
failure
to
make
the
restitution
payment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
wouldn't
see
the
federal
bankruptcy
code
as
a
bar
to
revocation
of
probation
in
the
latter
situation.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
are...
you
know,
the
last
clause
is
almost
meaningless
so
far
as
i
can
tell.
if
federal
law
prevents
the
revocation
of
probation
after
the
debt
has
been
discharged
in
bankruptcy,
why
say
let
state
courts
decide
according
to
state
law?
it's
being
controlled
by
federal
law,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
the
state
court
have
any
option
if
the
federal
defense
is
a
good
one?
you
don't
just
say,
well,
let
them
decide
it
for
themselves.
i
mean,
they
have
to
give
controlling
federal
law
the
nod
don't
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
are...
what
are
the
advantages
for
a
debtor
of
taking
chapter
7
over
chapter
13?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
take
it
the
requirement
for
regular
income
is
not
terribly
demanding
under
chapter
13,
if
social
security
alone
is
enough.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
would
be
enough...
i
take
it
it
was
deemed
enough
in
this
case
to
pay
10
percent?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but...
as
between
the
pre-code
situation
and
the
post-code
situation,
the
state
and
the
restitution
victim
i
take
it
would
prefer
the
pre-code
situation
were...
it
was
not...
it
was
not
includible
or
allowable,
but
is
also
dischargeable.
you
just
didn't
touch
it.
isn't
that
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
you
may
well
be
right
as
to
that's
what
congress
has
said.
but
certainly
it's
not
any
advantage
to
the
potential
recipient
of
restitution
to
have
had
that
done.
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
would
be
in
this
particular
case
10
percent?
chief
justice
rehnquist
less?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
and
that
may
well
be
congress'
decision.
my
only
point
is
it
should
not
be
painted
as
a
benefit
to
the
recipient
of
restitution
as
opposed
to
the
pre-code
situation.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
there
a
great
deal
of
conflict
during
the
80
years
of
the
previous
regime,
from
1898
to
1978?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
but
then
the
answer
to
justice
white's
question
isn't
that
the
states
are
mistaken,
but
the
states
are
not
mistaken,
but
congress
has
chosen
to
another
concern
rather
than
the
one
they
have--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
it
hasn't
just
expressed
its
concern.
it's
laid
down
a
rule
of
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
searles.
mr.
cohen,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cohen.
the
case
is
submitted.
