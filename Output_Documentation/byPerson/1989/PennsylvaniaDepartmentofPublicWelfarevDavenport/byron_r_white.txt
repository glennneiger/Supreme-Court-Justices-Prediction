justice
white
well,
what's
the
language
that's
involved
here?
what's
the
claim?
what
makes
it...
why
is
it
claimed
to
be
dischargeable?
because
it
is
said
to
be
a
debt?
justice
white
well,--
justice
white
--so
why
don't
we
have
to...
aren't
you
going
to
have
to
tell
us
what
a
debt
is
or
isn't?
justice
white
and
it
isn't...
it
isn't...
it's...
i
suppose
he
is
supposed
to
pay
it,
isn't
he.
justice
white
well,
he's
suppose
to
pay
it,
isn't
he?
justice
white
and
if
he
doesn't,
he'll
be
in
jail.
justice
white
that's
right.
justice
white
that's
right.
justice
white
i
suppose
that
wouldn't
make...
make
it
a
debt
that
was
dischargeable.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
wouldn't...
wouldn't
you
say
that
this
bankrupt
owed
the...
the...
is
it
the
state,
the
city...
the...
pennsylvania...
is
it
the
state
that
we
are
talking
about?
justice
white
didn't
the
bankruptor
owe
them
some
money?
justice
white
no,
no,
no.
no.
just...
from
the
moment
he...
he
committed
a
fraud
he
owed
them
some
money
didn't
he?
justice
white
and
couldn't
he
have
listed
that
as
a
debt
that
he
owed
to--
justice
white
--he
did
do
that
and
why
isn't
that
debt
dischargeable?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
isn't
that
debt
dischargeable?
he
lists
this
as
is
a
debt.
i
defrauded
the
department
and
i
owe
them
some
money
and
he
lists
it
as
a
debt.
now
isn't
that
dischargeable?
justice
white
but
the
restitution
order...
isn't
it
measured
by
what
the
fellow
took
from
somebody
else?
justice
white
wasn't
it
here?
justice
white
i
suppose
that
he
could
have
been
convicted
for
some
fraud
but
he
might
just
have
independently
paid
the
money
back
to
the...
to
the
city
or
to
the
department
of
welfare.
justice
white
he
might
have
done
that
and
still
been
convicted
mightn't
he?
justice
white
but
there
certainly
wouldn't
be
any
restitution
order.
justice
white
then
why
should
there
be
if
his
debt
has
been
discharged?
justice
white
but
suppose
it
didn't.
suppose...
suppose
the
discharge
is
first
and
the
criminal
proceeding
second?
justice
white
you
don't
think
you
could?
justice
white
if
you
went
in
and
said
this
is
a
debt--
justice
white
--that's
owed?
justice
white
--if
this
restitution
order
is
considered
a
debt,
do
you
lose?
justice
white
there
is
no
way
of
saying
that
the...
that
the
restitution
order
is
not
dischargeable
under
the
provisions
of
the
code?
justice
white
but
by
the
same
token
then
you
say
you
shouldn't
use
(a)(7)
to
show
that
this
is
a
debt
because
this--
justice
white
what
percentage
of
payment
did
this
plan
call
for?
justice
white
10
percent?
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
criminal
fines
would
be
discharged?
justice
white
when
he...
when
the...
the
13...
chapter
13
proceeding
was
filed,
he
did
list
his
debt
to
the
department,
didn't
he?
justice
white
but
the
department
never
filed
a
claim.
justice
white
i
take
it
they're
not
about
to
get
paid
what
they
are
entitled
to.
justice
white
they're
not
being
paid
in
full.
justice
white
all
you
mean
is
that
they
are
entitled
to...
they're
entitled
to
be
paid
whatever
the
plans
calls
them...
calls
for
them
to
get
paid.
justice
white
well,
i
take
it...
i
take
it
there
are
quite
a
number
of
states
filed
in
this
case
amicus
who
don't
think
your
position
is
very
beneficial
to
them.
justice
white
you
mean
all
these
states,
they
don't
know
a
thing
about
bankruptcy?
justice
white
well,
i
think
that
they...
they
must
think
that
if
their
restitution
order
is
not
dischargeable,
it
can...
it
can
be
used
to
collect
this
money
for
over...
for
years.
justice
white
which
the
states
don't
like
very
well.
justice
white
you
mean
they're
going
to
be...
they're
going
to
be...
get
as
much
as
they
can
this
way
anyway.
justice
white
well,
the
claims
under
7
aren't
going
to
be
dischargeable.
justice
white
the
debt
is
listed
and
if
you're
right,
your
debt
wouldn't
be
dischargeable,
but
meanwhile
you
could
get
your
1
percent
if
you
filed
a
claim.
justice
white
well,
it
might
be--
justice
white
--20
the
next
time.
