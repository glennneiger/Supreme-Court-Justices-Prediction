justice
scalia
restitution
for
something
that
he
doesn't
owe?
justice
scalia
mr.
cohen,
you
say
there
has
to
be
some...
some
indication
in
the
statute...
clear
indication,
or
whatever
terminology
you
use.
why
isn't
there?
i
mean
claim
is
defined...
is
defined...
well,
debt...
debt
means
liability
on
a
claim.
claim
means
right
to
payment
essentially.
and
then
you
have
section
523(a)(7)
which
makes
it
very
clear
that...
that
a
debt
includes
a
fine,
penalty
or
forfeiture.
it
says
that...
that
a
discharge
will
not
discharge
an
individual
from
any
debt
to
the
extent
such
debt
is
for
a
fine,
penalty,
or
forfeiture.
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
congress
thinks
that
a
fine,
penalty
or
forfeiture,
criminal
though
it
be,
is
a
debt.
justice
scalia
because
it
said
it
did
not
exclude
it.
right?
justice
scalia
well,
i
don't
care
about
the
question,
i'm
talking
about
the
text.
to
the
extent...
the
text
says
to
the
extent
such
debt
is
for
a
fine,
penalty
or
forfeiture.
and
you're
telling
us
that
that
language
is
meaningless
because
a
debt
can
never
be
for
a
fine,
penalty
or
forfeiture.
justice
scalia
i...
i...
i've
heard
of
a
civil
penalty
in
a
civil
forfeiture.
i
must
say
i've
never
heard
of
a
civil
fine.
a
civil
fine.
i
thought
a
fine
was
always
a
criminal
exaction.
i
mean,
we're
just
talking
about
words
here,
but
that's--
justice
scalia
--what
our
statutes
happen
to
be
written
in.
may
i
ask
on
the...
on
your
view
under...
in
pennsylvania.
supposing
you
have
the
same
judgment
you've
got
here
and
you
call
it
criminal
restitution
and
the
person
who
owes
the
money
dies.
would
you
be
able
to
recover
from...
and
say
there's
plenty
of
money
in
the
estate...
could
you
recover
on
the
claim
from
the
estate?
from
the
decedent's
estate?
justice
scalia
excise
me.
but
would
that
also
be
the
case...
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
this
is
a
restitution
order
or
just
a
plain...
plain
fine?
suppose
it
was
just
a...
just
a
fine.
it
doesn't
go
ultimately
to
the
victim
at
all?
it
just
goes
into
the
state
treasury?
justice
scalia
but
my...
my
point
is
a
fine
would
also
be
voidable
you
would
say
if
we
accept
the--
justice
scalia
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
answer
because
the
first
part
sort
of
read
out
the
last
part.
you'd...
you'd
say
it
would
be...
it
would
not
be
permissible
under
the
bankruptcy
law
insofar
as
it's
an
attempt
to
collect
a
debt.
but
it
is
an
attempt
to
collect
a
debt.
the
state
court
says,
i
don't
care
if
it's
been
discharged,
you
either
pay
it
up
or
your
probation
is
revoked.
justice
scalia
do
you
consider
that
an
attempt
to
collect
a
debt?
that's...
that's
what
we're
asking.
can
a
state
court
say
either
pay
up
or
your
probation
is
revoked?
justice
scalia
if
state
law
provides
that,
is
it
allowable
under
federal
law?
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
can
you...
can
you
explain
to
me
why...
why
you...
you
say
that
523(a)(7)
does
mean
when
it
says
fine,
penalty
or
forfeiture...
under
your
theory
it
means
both
civil
and
criminal.
right?
justice
scalia
why...
why...
why
did
congress
not
apply
that
to
chapter
13?
just
an
accident
or
what?
justice
scalia
what
is
the
limit?
justice
scalia
well,
all
the
horrible
results
that
you
say
would
ensue
if
we
agreed
with
the
states
that
conflict
between
state
collection
and
federal
law.
why
don't
those
same
consequences
arise
under
chapter
7
and
chapter
11
anyway?
and
is
it...
why
would
it
be
more
horrible
under
chapter
13?
justice
scalia
well,
that
may
well
be,
but
you're
still
going
to
have
conflict
between
the...
between,
you
know,
the
federal
policy
and
the--
justice
scalia
--yeah,
but
what
does
the
state
do?
the
state
says
i...
i
want
it
all.
justice
scalia
well,
i
know
they
would
pass
through.
but
when
the...
what
happens
when
the
court
is
about
to
distribute
all
of
this
stuff
to
other
people,
the
state
is
standing
there
saying
what
a
minute,
i...
you
know,
i
want
a--
justice
scalia
--i
see.
okay.
justice
scalia
the
priority
section...
the
priority
section
does
cover.
justice
scalia
i
see.
okay.
justice
scalia
they're
approvable?
justice
scalia
they're
approvable
as
debts?
justice
scalia
allowable.
yes.
justice
scalia
yeah.
