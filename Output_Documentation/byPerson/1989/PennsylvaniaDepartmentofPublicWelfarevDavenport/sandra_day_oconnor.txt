justice
o'connor
mr.
cohen,
were
criminal
monetary
sanctions
considered
debts
in
pre-code
chapter
13-type
proceedings?
justice
o'connor
were
they
dischargeable?
justice
o'connor
are
there
cases
that
you
cite
holding
that
criminal
monetary
sanctions
were
nondischargeable?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
if
someone
qualifies
for
bankruptcy,
that's
pretty
good
evidence
that
they
don't
have
the
ability
to
pay.
justice
o'connor
did
the
state
file
any
claim
here--
justice
o'connor
--for
the
underlying
obligation?
