mr.
walter
w.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
in
enacting
the
bankruptcy
code
of
1978
intended
that
a
criminal
convicted
of
welfare
fraud
and
sentenced
to
pay
restitution
as
a
condition
of
probation
in
a
state
court
can
walk
out
of
the
state
courthouse
and
into
the
federal
courthouse
to
have
the
judge's
criminal
restitution
order
wiped
out
in
a
bankruptcy
process.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
not
in
dispute.
the
defendants
in
september
of
1986
entered
guilty
pleas.
they
were
sentenced
to
pay
restitution
in
the
amount
of
$4,145
at
the
rate
of
$208
per
defendant
per
month
payable
to
the
county
probation
department.
a
period
of
months
passed.
they
failed
to
pay
and
they
then
proceeded
in
a
chapter
13
bankruptcy
filing.
the
probation
department
of
the
county
filed
a
previolation
notice
and
subsequently
held
a
hearing
and
then
the
bankruptcy
court
instituted
an
adversary
proceeding
at
the
instance
of
the
respondents
and
an
order
was
entered
discharging
the
state
court
restitution
sentence
as
a
debt.
that
decision
was
reversed
by
the
judge
in
the
eastern
district
based
upon
this
court's
reasoning
in
kelly
v.
robinson.
but
the
third
circuit
in
a
two-to-one
decision
reversed
and
the
order
of
discharge
stood,
cert
was
granted
by
this
court
to
address
the
question
of
whether
a
restitution
order
is
a
debt
that
is
dischargeable
in
a
chapter
13
bankruptcy
proceeding.
it
is
petitioners'
position
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
void
a
lawful
state
court
criminal
sentence
in
any
way
through
the
bankruptcy
process
or
in
particular
here
through
a
chapter
13
proceeding.
to
have
done
so
would
have
trampled
on
the
principles
of
federalism
in
comity
that
this
court
in
1971
in
younger
v.
harris
discussed
so
thoroughly
where
the
court
recognized
the
fundamental
policy
in
our
system
of
government
against
federal
interference
with
state
criminal
prosecutions.
further,
the
language
of
the
bankruptcy
code
does
not
clearly
spell
out
that
criminal
court
orders
of
this
nature
are
to
be
voided
through
discharge
in
a
chapter
13
proceeding.
additionally,
there
was
a
string
of
pre-code
cases
going
back
as
far
as
the
case
of
in
re
moore
in
kentucky
bankruptcy
court
in
1901
where
courts
refused
to
discharge
criminal
restitution
sentences.
that
is
very
important
under
the
test
that
the
supreme
court
set
forth
in
the
midlantic
case
and
the
court
said
that
if
congress
intends
for
legislation
to
change
the
interpretation
of
a
judicially-created
concept,
it
makes
that
intent
specific.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
they
were
not,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
the
criminal
court
orders
were
not...
they
were
dischargeable,
but
under
the
definition
of
debt.
i'm
sorry,
they
were
not
dischargeable.
but
under
the
definition
of
debt,
which
was
a
much
narrower
definition
at
that
time,
they
did
not
fall
under
that
definition.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
yes,
your
honor,
and
in
re
moore
is
one
of
them.
but
it's...
it's
a
whole
string
of
cases
cited
in
our
brief
that
stands
for
that
proposition.
in
the
ron
pair
enterprises
case,
this
court
also
said
that
we
must
look
very
carefully
to
its
clear
expression
of
congressional
intent
when
there
is
a
clear
conflict
with
state
and
federal
laws
of
great
importance.
here
the
conflict
is
between
the
bankruptcy
code
and
the
criminal
laws
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania.
in
kelly
v.
robinson,
this
court
said
you
must
look
to...
one
must
look
to
the
whole
law.
and
if
we
do
that,
we
find
no
solid
specific
evidence
of
any
congressional
intent
to
change
that
pre-code
law
to
allow
for
discharge
of
criminal
sentences.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
because
it
is
said
to
be
a
debt.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
a
debt
is
defined
as
a
liability
on
a
claim.
a
claim
is
a
right
to
payment--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--a
debt
is
a
liability
on
a
claim
and
claim
is
a
right
to
payment.
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
no
right
to
payment
when
you
have
a
situation
of
the
probation
department
essentially
being
the
payee
after
a
criminal
court
judge
has
ordered
that
a
sentence
of
restitution
be
imposed
as
a
condition
of
probation.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
your
honor,
it
is
a
sentence.
it's
not
a
debt.
he
must
pay
it--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--he
is
suppose
to
pay
it
if
he
is
to
follow
the
sentencing--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--that's
correct,
if
he
has
the
ability
to
pay
it.
under
bearden
v.
georgia
the
court
very
properly
clearly
held
that
you
cannot
send
somebody
to
jail.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
we
don't
have
debtor's
prisons.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
you
can't
send
somebody
to
jail
if
they
cannot
afford
to
pay
it.
but
a
sanction
of
going
to
jail
does
not
give
the
victim
in
this
case,
the
pennsylvania
department
of
public
welfare,
any
right
to
collect
the
money.
this
is
not
a
civil
judgment
order,
in
other
words.
it
is
a
criminal
sentence.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
yes,
your
honor,
but
a
criminal
restitution
sentence...
and
this
is
specifically
in
pennsylvania,
but
i
don't
think
that
we're
asking
this
court
to
just
hold
for
pennsylvania
obviously...
but
specifically
in
the
pennsylvania
statute,
a
restitution
order
for
welfare
fraud
can
continue
even
beyond
the
term
of
possible
sentence
for
the
underlying
crime,
which
in
this
case
was
seven
years.
so
that
the
probation
order
and
the
restitution
order
can
continue
far
beyond
the
three-year
period
of
consideration
for
the
issue
of
what
is
available
for
the
creditors
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
the
department
would
be
able
to
proceed
to
recoup
if
the
individuals
are
still
on
welfare.
there
is
no
process
in
pennsylvania--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--it's
an
exercise
of
recoupment
for
the
money
that
was
taken,
but
that
is--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--not
under
the
criminal
court
order,
your
honor.
only
in
a
separate
process,
which
is
not
the
process
before
the
court.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
they
have
to
proceed
civilly.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
the
welfare
department
does
not
recoup
on
the
basis
of
the
criminal
restitution
order.
so
there--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--it
proceeds
by
going
into
court
and
seeking
a
civil
judgment
for
the
money
unlawfully
paid.
and
the
standards
that
the
department
uses
are...
are
the
standard
basically
for
proceeding
civilly
as
opposed
to
criminally
is
a
lower
standard.
if
they
are
proceeding
criminally,
they
are
looking
at
the
intent.
they
are
looking
at
the
prior
history,
the
intent
of
the
individuals
involved
and
if
they
determine
that
it
is
risen
to
the
level
of
a
criminal
prosecution,
then
they
prosecute
criminally.
but
the
restitution
order
of
the
court
is
a
sentence
of
the
court.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
if
it
were
in
a
civil
proceeding.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
if
this
court
had
a
civil
judgment
order
in
front
of
it.
but
what
this
court
has
is
a
criminal
sentence
from
another
court,
a
court
that
is
enforcing
the
criminal
laws
of
the
state,
a
court
that
is
making
a
judgment
of
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
sentencing
process.
and
it
is
our
position,
which
we
advance
of
course
in
the
briefs,
that
the
purpose
of
a
restitution
sentence
is
the
same
as
any
other
sentence.
it
is
for
purposes
of
rehabilitation
of
the
defendant.
it
is
for
deterrence,
retribution,
punishment,
but
it
is
not
to
collect
the
debt
that
is
owed.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
your
honor,
there
are
some
states
that
in
fact
have
in
the
criminal
statute
a
civil
process
to
enact
a...
to
proceed
civilly
toward
a
civil
judgment.
but
it
is
still
our
position
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
set
up
in
the
bankruptcy
process,
a
method
that
people
convicted
of
crimes
can
escape
from
their
sentence.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
the
department
of
public
welfare
paying
out--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--as
a
result
of
the
sentence--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--that's
correct.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
he
did
do
that.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
because
that
is
different
from
the
criminal
sentence
itself.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
oh,
because...
that
process
and
what
the
court
did
here
was
to
actually
end
up
with
$120
paid
out
to
the
creditors
and
said
that
that
was
one
of
the
debts...
one
of
many
debts
that
was
dischargeable.
but
we
are
not
looking
at
a
civil
judgment
or
a
civil
claim.
we
are
looking
a
criminal
court
sentence.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
it
can
be.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
and
in
this
case
it
was.
but
at
the
same
time
a
restitution
order
can
be
entered
and
has
been
entered
in
pennsylvania
in
1987
in
5,000
cases
measured
not
by
the
total
loss,
but
by
some
judgment
as
to
what
in
terms
of
rehabilitation
of
the
defendant,
what
amount
of
money
would
indicate
to
that
defendant
that
he
or
she
is
paying
back
money
for
something
that
he
or
she
did
wrongly.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
to
the
state.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
that
would
be
possible.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
that's
correct
under
those
circumstances,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
the
restitution
order
came
before
any
proceeding
in
bankruptcy.
the
restitution
order
was
a
valid
order.
if
he
were
to
challenge
that
order,
that
should
be
challenged
through
the
state
court
process.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
i
still
don't
think
it
matters,
your
honor,
because
i
think
that--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--it
is
our
position
that
they
do.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
restitution
for
something
that
the
bankruptcy
court
has
said
that
he
doesn't
owe
but
that
the
criminal
court
judge
can
still
say
is
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
in
the
judgment
made
by
the
state
legislature.
and
that's
why
in
this
discussion
i
think
we
are
pointing
out
the
whole
problem
of
did
congress
of
the
united
states
intend
to
limit
the
authority
of
a
state
court
judge
or
to
wipe
out
the
sentence
of
a
state
court
judge
where
the
judge
is
enforcing
the
laws
of
the
commonwealth,
laws
that
the
state
legislature
are
suppose
to
be
able
to
enact
to
protect
the
citizens
and
laws,
in
fact
in
this
instance,
that
this
court
in
bowen
v.
roy
indicated
were
important
laws...
the
ability
of
the
state
to
police
welfare
fraud.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
and--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--your
honor,
in
kelly
v.
robinson
this
court
did
act
based
upon
that
section
of
the
bankruptcy
code
and
acted
to
uphold
the
restitution
order
basically
in
that
connecticut
case.
but
the
issue
of
whether
a
sentence--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--it
said
to
the
extent
that
it
is
a
debt
it
is
not
dischargeable.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
they
didn't
reach--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
no,
your
honor.
i...
i
would
say
in
response
directly
to
your
question
that
the
fine,
penalty
or
forfeiture
that
the
congress
is
speaking
of
there
is
a
civil
fine,
penalty
or
forfeiture,
not
a
criminal
fine,
penalty
or
forfeiture.
there
is
no
discussion...
and
that's
why
we
are
standing
here
talking
about
congressional
intent...
there
is
no
discussion
of
criminal
fines,
penalty,
or
forfeiture.
in
fact,
the
congress
said
that
the
bankruptcy
laws
are
not
to
be
a
have
for
criminal
offenders.
the
bankruptcy
laws
are
intended
to
protect
honest
debtors
attempting,
when
they
are
financially
overextended,
to
have
a
fresh
start
and
not
to
protect
criminal
offenders.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
that's
the
case.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
because--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--i
think
it
is
a--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--it
is
a
sentence
to
the...
to
the
individual.
it
is
not
a
debt
that
would
be
owed
from
the
estate.
if
it
were
a
civil
judgment,
then
that
would
be
different.
now,
there
is
some
case
law
to
the
contrary
on
that.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
no,
your
honor.
not
that
i
am
aware
of.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
no.
in
kelly
v.
robinson
this
court...
justice
powell,
in
fact,
writing
for
the
majority
quoted
justice
powell
writing
for
the
descent
in
tva
v.
hill,
the
snaildarter
case,
and
he
said...
this
was
in
the
majority
opinion...
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
discharge
state
criminal
sentences,
we
can
be
certain
that
there
would
have
been
hearings,
testimony,
and
debate
concerning
consequences
so
likely
to
arouse
public
outrage.
in
other
congressional
acts,
such
as
the
victim
and
witness
protection
act
of
1982,
congress
very
clearly
intended
to
highlight
restitution
as
a
criminal
sanction.
in
the
financial
institutions
reform,
recovery
and
enforcement
act
of
1989,
congress
showed
its
intent
again
that
restitution
be
a
sanction
in
the
savings
and
loan
scandals.
in
the
automatic
stay
provision
which
is
where
the...
during
the
course
of
the
debate
on
the
automatic
stay,
where
the
congress
indicated
that
the
bankruptcy
laws...
and
they
didn't
just
the
automatic
stay
provision,
they
said
the
bankruptcy
laws
are
not
intended
to
be
a
haven
for
criminal
offenders.
and
that
section...
it
would
be
contradictory
to
then
allow
an
offender
to
escape
a
sentence
if
in
fact
there
is
an
exception
to
a
stay
to
allow
criminal
proceedings
to
commence
or
to
continue.
in
the
preferential
transfer
provisions,
which
weighed
transfers
for
the
benefit
of
a
creditor
on
account
of
a
debt
owed
within
90
days...
in
that
situation,
under
the
ruling
of
the
third
circuit,
the
criminal
restitution
order
is
a
debt
and
the
department
of
public
welfare
here
is
a
creditor,
the
department
would
have
to
pay
back
the
money.
they
would
have
to
refund
the
restitution
payments
made
under
the
state
court
judge's
order.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
because
it
would
be
within
the
90-day
period
and
a
preference,
a
debt,
would
have
to
be
paid
back.
so,
the
issue
of
federalism...
the
issue
of
the--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
that
is
different
because
a
restitution
order...
well,
i
guess
a
fine
would
still
be
a
sentence.
so
i
suppose
that
would
be
correct.
it
would
be
the
same.
a
restitution
order
being
a
sentence,
the
fine
being
the
sentence.
but
the
greater
concern
here--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--if
you
accept
the
position
of
the
third
circuit.
so
what
the--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--no,
because
under
what
justice
scalia
would
be
saying--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--it
was
a
debt.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
it
was...
it
is
a
debt.
that
would
be
why.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
that's
correct
and
it's
money
that
otherwise
should
be
available
to
all
of
the
creditors
in
the
context
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
i'm
sorry,
i
thought
justice
scalia
was
not
focused
on
the
preferential
transfer
provision,
but
on
the
underlying
issue
before
the
court.
the
whole
question
of
the
role
of
the
federal
government
vis-a-vis
role
of
the
state
government,
the
issues
raised
by
this
court
in
younger
v.
harris
lead
to
an
infringement
on
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
if
the
federal
court
can
determine
that
a
criminal
court
judge
cannot
take
into
consideration
all
of
the
factors,
all
of
the
sanction
alternatives
that
are
left
available
to
the
court
in
a
criminal
sentence
and
decide
what
is
the
most
appropriate
sentence
to
rehabilitate,
to
protect
the
people
and
to
punish
the
offender.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
in
this
case,
for
example,
your
honor,
it
was
a
condition
of
probation
imposed
along
with
court
costs
so
that
court
costs
were
separate
from
the
restitution
order
which
was
a
condition
of
the
probation
sentence
of
one
year.
but
it
can
be
imposed
in
a
variety
of
different
ways.
it
was,
as
i
mentioned,
5,000
times
it
was
imposed
as
a
sentence
or
as
a
condition
of
probation,
but
in
many
of
those
instance
it
was
a--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--it
would
have
difficulty.
i
think
that
they
could
still
do
that,
but
the
problem
would
be
they
could
only
do
that
once
there
was
a
determination
at
the
time
that
the
court
was
proceeding
to
the
probation
hearing
that
the
person
had
the
ability
to
pay.
now
in
the
discussion...
in
the
oral
argument--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--because
you
can't...
under
bearden
v.
georgia,
state
court
or
federal
court
cannot
revoke
probation
without
making
that
determination
of
the
ability
of
the
defendant--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--that's
correct.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
no,
i
don't
think
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
but
i
think
that
what
that
then
does
in
the
future
is
set
up
a
system
where
people
convicted
of
welfare
fraud
would
go
to
prison.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
i
thought
the--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--if
he
wants
to
rely
on
the
discharge,
he
goes
to
jail.
even
under
that
circumstance,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
then
we
create
a
system
that
does
not
give
the
proper
balance
between
what
the
bankruptcy
court
can
do
and
what
the
criminal
court
trial
judge
can
do.
so
i
think
that
judges
will,
faced
with
a
decision
by
this
court
upholding
the
third
circuit,
they
will
sentence
people
initially
to
prison.
and
the
whole
restitution
process,
the
whole
victim's
rights
movement
that
has
grown
so
strongly
in
the
'80s
as
a
part
of
the
criminal
justice
system,
will
take
a
large
step
backwards.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
we
lose
this
case.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
no,
not
at
all,
because
the
523(a)(7)
applies
to
chapter
7
but
not
to
chapter
13
bankruptcies
under
section
1328(a).
so
we
have
to
rise
or
fall
on
the
question
of
whether
a
restitution
order
is
a
sentence
or
is
a
debt.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
i...
i
would
say
that.
yes,
your
honor.
and
may
i
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time?
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
let
me
just
call
the
court's
attention
to
the
joint
appendix
page
14a
and
15a
which
sets
forth
the
plan
to
indicate
that
the
payment
in
this
case
was
1
percent
to
the
creditors
and
not
even
10
percent.
thank
you.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
no,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
no,
the
claim
was
listed
in
the
plan,
but
the
state...
and
i
think
that
that
indicates
the
state
prosecutors
have
a
order
of
a
court
and
we
believe
it
would
be
unseemly
for
the
prosecutor
to
have
to
go
in
to
enforce
a
criminal
court
judge's
sentence
in
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
that's
only
1
percent,
your
honor,
of
a
judge's--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--order
on
the--
mr.
walter
w.
cohen
--of
a
commission
of
a
crime.
