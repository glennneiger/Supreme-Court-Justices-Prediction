mr.
david
a.
searles
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
david
a.
searles
your
honor,
i
think
it
depends
whether
the
restitution
order
is
an
independent
component
of
the
criminal
sentence
or
whether
it's
a
condition
of
probation.
in
this
case
it
was
originally
a
condition
of
probation,
but
the
probation
has
expired.
all
that
remains
is
the
order
to
pay
restitution.
and
if
the
criminal
court
were
to
try
to
compel
payment
of
the
restitution
after
discharge,
i
think
that
would
be
inappropriate
under
section
524,
under
the
statutory
injunction
against
collecting
discharged
debts.
if
there
were
still
a
condition
of
probation
and
the
restitution
had
been
discharged,
then
i
think
the
answer
would
depend
on
state
law,
which
is
could
the
state
court
judge
modify
or
revoke
probation
when
the
original
conditions
of
probation
have
proved
impossible
or
infeasible.
mr.
david
a.
searles
it
would
be
a
bar
insofar
as
in
an
attempt
to
collect
money
that
had
been
discharged...
a
debt
that
had
been
discharged.
but
i
think
the
answer
would
be
up
to
the
state
courts
to
determine
on
a
case-to-case
basis
which
is,
depending
on
state
law,
having
to
do
with
an
original
condition
of
probation
having
become
infeasible.
what
does
that
leave
the
state
court
judge
to
do?
mr.
david
a.
searles
i
think
what--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--i
think
that--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--i
think
that
524
would
bar
that.
mr.
david
a.
searles
that's...
court...
the
congress'
statutory
injunction
against
collection
of
a
discharged
debt.
but
i
think
what
the
defendant
in
that
case
would
do
would
be
to
go
to
state
court,
present
his
thorough
law
defense.
as
the
third
circuit
has
held
in
the
davis
case,
we
can
presume
that
state
courts
are
going
to
uphold
federal
law
defenses
and
let
the
state
court
decide
that
based
on
state
law.
mr.
david
a.
searles
that
would
be
the
defense,
that
federal
law
precludes
collection
of
the
debt.
mr.
david
a.
searles
i
believe
that's
true.
mr.
david
a.
searles
yes,
it
is.
mr.
david
a.
searles
yes.
mr.
david
a.
searles
yes.
mr.
david
a.
searles
what
a
debtor
in
a
chapter
13
does
is...
is
sets
forth
what
his
disposable
income
is
and
proposes
that
be
paid
to
the
trustee
on
a
periodic
basis
and
the
trustee
takes
that
money
and
pays
it
to
the
various
creditors
who
have
filed
claims.
mr.
david
a.
searles
they
did
not
file
a
claim.
mr.
david
a.
searles
they
would
not
have
been
paid
in
full.
they
would
have
been
paid
to
the
extent
that
the
debtor
could
afford
it--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--based
on
the
bankruptcy
judge's
determination
of
what
he
could
afford.
mr.
david
a.
searles
well,
i
think
bankruptcy
courts
have...
have
the
power
to
dismiss
bankruptcies
or
deny
confirmation
of
bankruptcy
plans
if
they
feel,
based
on
all
the
circumstances
that
exist--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--that
it's
not
a
proper--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--that
doesn't
meet
the
good
faith
requirement.
the
state
didn't
even
come
to
court
to
object
on
that
ground
or
any
other
ground.
if
they--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--this
called
for
a
very
low
percentage.
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
it
was.
mr.
david
a.
searles
it
may
have
been
lower
than
10
percent.
mr.
david
a.
searles
the
davenport's
only
income
was
social
security
disability
benefits.
after
all
their
expenses
they
had
left
over
a
very
small
amount
and
that's
what
was
proposed
to
pay
into
the
plan.
mr.
david
a.
searles
after
the
bankruptcy?
mr.
david
a.
searles
after
the
bankruptcy,
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
pay.
mr.
david
a.
searles
in
fact,
that's
what
happened.
during
the
bankruptcy
when
there
was
motion
to
revoke
probation,
the
davenports
voluntarily
went
back
to
state
court.
we
did
not
try
to
restrain
the
state
court
from
proceeding,
and
the
davenports
appeared
and
they
testified
about
their
inability
to
pay,
and
the
state
court
judge
found
that
there
was
inability
to
pay,
denied
the
motion
to
revoke
probation,
and
the
probationary
period
expired.
there
was...
there
was
no
interference
with
the
state
court
system
here.
but
their
main
intention--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
searles
i
think
it
has
to
do
with
the
purposes
of
chapter
13,
which
is,
instead
of
liquidating
your
property
and
distributing
the
non-exempt
assets
to
your
creditors,
which
is
what
you
do
in
7,
a
13
is
a
means
to
keep
property
and
pay
your
creditors
to
the
extent
that
you
are
able
to.
so
it's
a
broader
discharge
in
a
chapter
13
because
the
result
in
most
cases
is
going
to
be
that
all
the
debtor's
disposable
income
is
going
to
committed
to
the
plan
and
paid
to
the
creditors.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
creditors
don't
get
100
percent,
well,
congress
has
made
a
decision
that
debts
are
not
going
to
hang
over
the
debtors
head
ad
infinitum
and
at
that
point
they
receive
a
discharge.
so
what
congress
has
done
is
provide
for
a
broader
discharge
in
some
chapter
13
cases,
the
ones
that
are
completed
under
1328(a),
and
provide
for
a
discharge
of
all
debts
listed
with
two
exceptions.
one
of
them
being
long-term
debts
and
the
other
being
alimony
and
support.
but
all
the
5...
the
other
523(a)
exceptions
in
chapter
7
were
not...
were
specifically
not
incorporated
into
1328(a).
mr.
david
a.
searles
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
searles
a
debtor
who
perhaps
didn't
have...
couldn't
meet
the
eligibility
requirements
of
chapter
13,
who
didn't
have
regular
income,
or
who
had
more
debts
than
he
can
have
under
chapter
13,
might
be
forced
to
liquidate
rather
than
to
reorganize.
mr.
david
a.
searles
it
has
to
be
regular.
but
it
also
has
to
be
enough
to
pay
the
claims
that
are
filed
in
accordance
with
the
priority
scheme
set
up
by
the...
by
the
court.
mr.
david
a.
searles
it
was
deemed
enough...
i'm
not
sure
what
the
percentage
was,
but
yes,
it
was
deemed
enough.
the
trustee
reviewed
the
plan,
recommended
confirmation
of
the
court,
and
the
court
confirmed.
no
creditor
came
into
court
to
object
and
both
the
petitioners
in
this
case
had
prior
notice
of
the
bankruptcy
well
before
the
confirmation
deadline
for
objecting.
they
didn't
file
proofs
of
claim
and
they
did
not
object.
our
main
contention
is
that
it...
restitution
is
a
right
to
payment
under
the
code
because
there
is
a
state
court
order
requiring
the
davenports
to
pay
the
money
and
the
state
order
is
pursuant
to
a
state
court
statute
mandating
repayment
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
the
state
court
judge
had
no
flexibility
in
imposing
a
sentence.
he
had
to
order
restitution
in
these
kinds
of
cases
and
the
restitution
is
enforceable
through
contempt
proceedings
or
in
some
states,
by
civil
actions.
and
under
any
common
sense
reading
of
the
term,
the
relationship
between
the
parties
here
is
one
that
created
a
right
to
payment
on
behalf
of
the
petitioners.
mr.
david
a.
searles
yes,
he
did.
mr.
david
a.
searles
that's
correct.
besides
the
definition
of
claim
in
section
101,
there
are
two
other
sections
of
the
code
which
treat
restitution
as
a
debt.
one
is
523(a)(7),
which
refers
to
debts
that
are
fines,
penalties,
and
forfeitures,
which
represents
congress'
codification
of
the
pre-code
judicial
exception
to
dischargeability
of
criminal
and
civil
penalties.
congress
has
now
upheld
that
those
exception...
congress
has...
excuse
me...
written
the
law
in
a
way
that
preserves
those
exception
to
discharge
in
chapter
7,
chapter
12,
some
chapter
11
and
some
chapter
13
cases.
so
the
fact
that
they
acted
expressly
to
protect
those
debts
in
some
cases
but
not
others
indicates
that
they
did
consider
them
debts.
and,
as
i
said,
that
they
incorporated
those
exceptions
in
13
for
some
kinds
of
debts
but
not
others,
including
fine,
penalty
and
forfeiture,
that
also
indicates
that
it
was
a
debt.
another
section
of
the
code,
which
is
726,
provides
for
distribution
of
the
property
of
the
estate
in
payment
of
fines,
penalties,
and
forfeitures.
the
same
phrase
from
523(a)(7).
and
also
fines,
penalties,
and
forfeitures
was
the
title
heading
of
a
chapter
in
the
crimes
code
at
the
time
the
bankruptcy
code
was
enacted,
which
is
another
indication
that
congress
meant
to
include
criminal
penalties
as
well.
by
providing
for
distribution
on
fines,
penalties,
and
forfeitures,
which
wasn't
the
case
under
the
act...
because
these
kinds
of
claims
were
not
allowable,
were
not
entitled
to
share
in
the
distribution
of
the
estate...
congress
has
shown
it's
intention
that
these
are
debts
that
should
be
paid.
and
there's
very
good
reason
for
including
them
in
distribution,
because
if
they
weren't
included,
the
entire
estate
could
be
liquidated
and
distributed
without
any
payment
to
the
restitution
victim.
and
this,
we
submit,
would
not
make
any
sense
because
in
some
cases
that
distribution
might
represent
the
victim's
best
chance
of
recovering
any
money.
mr.
david
a.
searles
that
is
right.
it
would...
it
would
pass
through
the
bankruptcy
and
remain
owing
after
the
bankruptcy
was
over.
mr.
david
a.
searles
but
what
congress
has
said
now
is
that
these
are
claims
that
are
to
be
paid
through
the
distribution
of
the
bankruptcy
estate.
mr.
david
a.
searles
well,
but
this
time...
this
time
they
get
paid
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
estate
that
has
assets
in
it.
mr.
david
a.
searles
or--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--whatever
it
was.
but
congress
has
made
a
decision
that
they
should
get...
they
should
share
equally
in
the
estate
with
other
creditors.
mr.
david
a.
searles
well,
i
think
it
represents
congress'
intent
that
all
creditors
share
equally.
just
because
you
have
a
restitution
order
shouldn't
give
you
preferential
treatment
over
other
possible
victims
of
crimes
or
serious
torts
who
have
not
obtained
restitution
orders.
if
fines
and
penalties
were
not
included
in
distribution,
this
would
set
up
a
conflict
between
the
federal
courts
and
the
state
courts
over
the
administration
of
the
debtor's
assets.
and
by
giving
bankruptcy
court
sole
jurisdiction
over
the
debtor's
estate
in
section
1334(d)
of
title
28
congress
has
expressed
its
intention
that
it's
the
federal...
for
the
bankruptcy
court,
a
single
forum,
that
administers
the
debtor's
affairs.
mr.
david
a.
searles
i'm
not
aware
of
any
cases
discusses
that,
but
it
appears
to
me
that
there
could
have
been
conflict
because
the
debtor's
estate
was
being
distributed
without
the
holder
of
the
penalty
or
forfeiture
claim
getting
any
money--
finally,
if
you
look
outside
the
bankruptcy
law,
at
the
federal
crimes
code,
there
is
a
section
in
there
that
shows
that
congress
obviously
intended
criminal
fines
to
be
debts,
which
is
section
3613(f)
of
title
18
which
was
amended
in
1984
to
make
federal
criminal
fines
nondischargeable
in
any
bankruptcy.
there
would
be
no
point
in
congress
writing
that
exception
unless
they
thought
fines
were
debts
in
the
first
place.
and
when
congress
did
take
this
step
to
accept
federal
criminal
fines,
it
did
not
do
so
for
state
criminal
fines.
the
petitioners
throughout
the
case
have
raised
policy
concerns
which
they
believe
support
the
notion
that
restitution
should
not
be
considered
a
debt.
what
they
fail
to
focus
on
is
that
their
concerns
are
already
met
and
already
addressed
in
chapter
13.
chapter
13
is
basically
a
new
system
for
consumer
debt
and
it's
singular
in
its
approach.
unlike
old
chapter
13,
or
chapter
11,
a
debtor
can
now
reorganize
his
affairs
as
long
as
he
meets
certain
guidelines
set
forth
in
the
code.
he
no
longer
needs
affirmative
voting
approval
from
his
creditors.
what
congress
has
done
in
chapter
13
has
been
to
balance
the
rights
of
the
debtor
and
the
creditors,
and
to
establish
guidelines
that
are
designed
to
ensure
that
the
creditors
get
fair
and
equal
treatment.
they
suggest
that
chapter
13
can
be
used
as
a
vehicle
for
criminals
to
escape
the
consequences
of
their
act.
and
this
is
simply
not
the
case.
many
criminal
defendants
would
not
be
eligible
for
chapter
13.
there
is
a
ceiling
on
the
amount
of
debt
you
can
have
to
be
eligible.
and
defendants
who
have
been
assessed
large
penalties
for
convictions
for
insider
trading
or
toxic
torts,
or
defrauding
savings
and
loans,
they
will
not
be
eligible
to
use
chapter
13.
mr.
david
a.
searles
it's
$100,000
of
unsecured
debt.
anyone
penalized
above
that
would
not
be
eligible
for
chapter
13.
in
addition,
a
debtor
must
have
regular
income
and
the
bankruptcy
filing
must
be
in
good
faith.
and
bankruptcy
courts
have
not
hesitated
to
dismiss
bankruptcies
or
deny
confirmations
of
plans
where
they
felt
the
circumstances
warranted
it.
beyond
the
restrictions
on
debtors,
congress
has
given
a
number
of
rights
to
creditors
to
assure
that
they
can
demand
and
assure
that
a
debtor
cannot
use
a
13
to
avoid
debts
which
he
can't
afford
to
pay.
the
creditors
can
come
into
court,
scrutinize
the
debtor's
income
and
expenses,
demand
that
all
disposable
income
is
being
paid
into
the
plan.
they
can
demand
to
receive
at
least
as
much
as
they
would
receive
in
chapter
7
liquidation,
and
they
can
object
to
confirmation
if
they
feel
that
the
plan
isn't
paying
them
what
they
are
entitled
to.
in
other
words
chapter
13
has
already
provided
petitioners
here
with
all--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--they
are
not
going
to
be
paid...
in
this
case,
it
depends--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--well,
if
they
felt
that
was
a
valid
objection,
they
could
come
to
court
and
make
it
and
it
would
be
up
to
the
judge
to
decide
whether
the
plan
comported
with
the
code.
mr.
david
a.
searles
assuming
the
plan
is
a
confirmable
plan.
if
there
are
problems
with
the
plan,
they
are
entitled
to
object
and
bring
that
to
the
attention
to
of
the
court.
the
petitioners
in
this
case
did
not...
chose
not
to
exercise
any
of
these
rights
that
congress
has
given
them.
but
if
their
argument
is
accepted
and
restitution
is
declared
to
be
something
other
than
a
debt,
the
result
is
going
to
frustrate
fundamental
bankruptcy
policy
because
it's
going
to
result
in
preferential
treatment
for
some
creditors
over
others.
including,
as
i
said
before,
perhaps
other
victims
of
crimes
or
serious
torts
who
had
not
obtained
restitution
orders
and
who,
in
some
people's
eyes,
may
have
more
sympathetic
claims.
it
would
also
result
in
a
conflict
between
the
state
court
system
and
the
federal
court
or
the
administration
of
the
debtor's
property
where
congress
has
already
expressed
its
intention
that
that
property
be
administered
through
a
single
forum,
which
is
the
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
david
a.
searles
i
think
that
results
from
their
misunderstanding
of
the
nature
of
chapter
13.
mr.
david
a.
searles
they
may
know
something,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
believe
they
understand
the
purpose
of
chapter
13,
and
the
rights
that
they
have
in
chapter
13.
what
the
petitioners
have--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--i
think
that's
what
they...
that's
true.
but
i
think
what
congress
has
decided
is
that
at
some
point
your
debts
do
not
any
long
hang
over
your
head.
and,
to
that
extent,
if
there
is
a
conflict
between
those
two
systems,
that's
a
result
of
what
congress
has
decided
when
they
wrote
chapter
13.
and
if
congress
feels
that's
wrong,
that's
up
to
congress
to
change.
mr.
david
a.
searles
there
are
some
cases
where
there
is
a
conflict
and
that's
right,
congress
has
expressed
its
concern.
but
there
are
many
other
cases
which
they
failed
to--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
searles
but
i
think
if
the
states
understood
the
nature
of
chapter
13
and
their
rights
there
to
compel
the
debtor
to
pay
as
much
as
they
can,
the
states
wouldn't
object
as
vociferously.
mr.
david
a.
searles
in
many
chapter
13s
they
would
be
paid
as
much
as
they
would
get
absent
the
bankruptcy.
that's
correct,
and
they
have
the
right
to
assure
that
that
happens.
mr.
david
a.
searles
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
case.
we
had
three
companion...
two
companion
cases
to
this
one
before
the
third
circuit
dismissed
the
other
two
and
those
bankruptcies
were
filed
primarily
by
the
debtors
to
cure
the
mortgage
arrears
on
their
homes.
the
restitution
debt
was
an
incidental
debt--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--that
was
included
in
their...
in
their
statement.
and
many
of
the
chapter
13
consumer
bankruptcies,
if
not
most,
have
to
deal
with
the
debtor
trying
to
keep
a
house
or
a
car
that
they
need
to
go
to
work
so
that
they
can
continue
to
pay
their
debts.
mr.
david
a.
searles
if
the
states
went
to
court?
mr.
david
a.
searles
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
searles
the
vast
majority
of
consumer
chapter
13
plans
are
designed
to...
to
prevent
foreclosure
of
homes
primarily
because
it's...
it's
something
that
really
wasn't
available
prior
to
chapter
13.
mr.
david
a.
searles
because
you
stop
foreclosure,
pay
the
arrears
at
the
rate
that
you
can
afford
and
then
pick
up
your
payments
and
life
goes
on.
mr.
david
a.
searles
well,
a
chapter
7
isn't
designed
to
help
a
debtor
maintain
his
home.
chapter
7
is--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--well,
in
a
chapter
7,
if
there's
assets
to
be
distributed,
it's
going
to
be
done
through
the
bankruptcy
court
and
the
parties,
such
as
petitioners,
who
have
claims
for
these
kinds
of
obligations
must
share
in
the
distribution.
mr.
david
a.
searles
absent
the
bankruptcy,
in
some
cases
the
state
may
not
be
able
to
have
it
all.
under
bearden
and
similar...
similar
law.
mr.
david
a.
searles
that's
correct.
they
would
pass...
they
would
pass
through.
mr.
david
a.
searles
well,
in
a
chapter
7,
the
state
would
get
what
it's
entitled
to
under
the
priority
sections
of
the
code,
but
the
debt
would
pass
through--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--and
the
state
would
still
have
the
ability
to--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--yes.
they...
they're
included.
mr.
david
a.
searles
they
have
726(a)(4).
they
have--
mr.
david
a.
searles
--yes.
mr.
david
a.
searles
yes.
they're
allowable.
mr.
david
a.
searles
before
they
were
not
allowable.
they
couldn't
share
in
the
estate.
mr.
david
a.
searles
now
they
can.
that's
correct.
and
also
throughout
the
case
what
petitioners
have
argued
is
that
how
chapter
13
unduly
interferes
with
state
court
proceedings.
but
as
i
was
explaining
before,
the...
that...
the
fallacy
of
that
argument
is
proved
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
while
the
bankruptcy
was
pending,
the
state
was
free
to
file
a
motion
to
revoke
probation,
which
they
did.
there
was
not
effort
to
restrain
the
state
court
from
proceeding.
the
davenports
voluntarily
appeared
there
and
testified
on
the
issue,
which
was
whether
they
had
the
ability
to
pay,
whether
they
had
violated
probation.
the
state
court
judge,
completely
unimpeded
by
the
federal
court,
denied
the
motion
to
revoke
probation,
decided
that
the
davenports
had
done
what
they
were
suppose
to
have
done
under
the
law.
probation
expired.
the
state
judge's
power
to
rule
is
completely
unaffected
by
the
bankruptcy
and
in
most
cases,
if
the
third
circuit's
ruling
is...
is
affirmed,
that
is
not
going...
the
result
is
not
going
to
affect
the
powers
of
state
court
judges.
and
the
reason
that
there
is
no
undue
interference
in
state
court
proceedings
is
that
the
underlying
goal
of
the
13
and
the
restitution
is
substantially
similar,
which
is
that
the
debtor
pay
the
restitution
order
to
the
best
of
his
ability.
that
is
what
the
davenports
intended
to
do
through
their
bankruptcy
and
the
state
court
judge
found
nothing
to
the
contrary.
in
conclusion,
what
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
treating
restitution
as
a
debt
is
consistent
with
the
plain
language
of
the
code
and
with
federal
bankruptcy
policy
that
a
debtor
deal
with
all
his
legal
obligations
in
one
form
and
that
the
creditors
receive
equal
treatment.
congress
has
designed
chapter
13
in
such
a
way
that
the
legitimate
rights
of
creditors
are
protected
and
they
have
the
tools
necessary
to
protect
their
interests
if
they
choose
to
utilize
them.
although
petitioners
expressed
fear
of
interference
in
state
court
proceedings,
that
fear
is
just
not
justified.
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
tension
between
the
two
court
systems,
that
arises
from
the
bankruptcy
clause
in
the
constitution
as
implemented
by
the
code.
if
there
is
a
difference
balance
to
be
struck,
it's
up
to
the
legislature
to
decide
that
and
not
to
the
judiciary.
we
request
that
the
decision
below
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
