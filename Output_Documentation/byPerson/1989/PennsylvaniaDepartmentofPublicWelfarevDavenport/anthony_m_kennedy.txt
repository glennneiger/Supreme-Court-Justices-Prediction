justice
kennedy
does
the
probation...
does
the
welfare
department
have
a
right
of
setoff
against
future
payments
for
the
nonpayment
of
the
fine?
justice
kennedy
well,
that's...
that's...
that's
exercising
a
right...
a
right
of
payment,
i
take
it.
justice
kennedy
well,
you
call
it...
you
call
it
recoupment.
justice
kennedy
well,
what
do
they
have
to
do
in
order
to
recoup
other
than
just
read
the
court
order?
justice
kennedy
and
how
do...
how
do
they
do
that?
justice
kennedy
how
it
does
it
proceed
civilly?
justice
kennedy
so
the
recoupment
can
only
be
after
a
civil
proceeding?
justice
kennedy
if
you
had
a
state
where
the
welfare
department
could
recoup
simply
based
on
the
criminal
judgment,
would
the
debt
be...
would
the
transaction
be
a
debt
in
those
states?
justice
kennedy
well,
the
question
is
does...
does
the
pennsylvania
criminal
court
have
authority
to
impose
the
restitution
order
even
if
the
debt
has
been
discharged.
justice
kennedy
well,
they
didn't
reach
the
question.
they
really
didn't
reach
the
question.
justice
kennedy
all
right.
justice
kennedy
can
you--
justice
kennedy
--well,
why
is
that
if...
if
the
defendant
wishes
to
avoid
incarceration
and
he
can
come
up
with
the
money
to
pay,
he
just
pays
it
despite
the
fact
there's
been
a
discharge.
justice
kennedy
he
has
his
choice.
he
goes
to
jail
or
he
pays.
but
if
it
is--
