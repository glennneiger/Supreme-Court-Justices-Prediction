mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
prior
to
1982,
usa
petroleum
was
quite
content
with
conditions
in
the
gasoline
market.
according
to
its
complaint,
the
major
oil
companies
did
not
compete
on
the
basis
of
price
but,
instead,
advertised
heavily
and
offered
extras
like
credit
cards,
clean
stations
and
attendants
to
pump
gas,
check
the
oil
and
wipe
the
windshield.
they
left
price
competition
on
the
basis
of
the
bottomline
price
at
the
pump
to
the
independents
like
usa.
in
1982,
arco
changed
its
strategy.
it
saw
what
the
independents
were
doing,
said
two
can
play
that
game,
and
embarked
on
a
campaign
to
lower
the
price
consumers
would
have
to
pay
for
arco
gasoline.
the
campaign
was
successful.
arco
increased
its
market
share,
while
usa
lost
sales
and
profits
to
the
newly
competitive
arco
dealers.
now
the
crux
of
usa's
complaint
is
that
arco
lowered
its
prices
by
forcing
the
arco
dealers
to
do
so;
but
so
far
as
the
antitrust
laws
are
concerned,
any
coercion
of
arco
dealers
by
arco
is
none
of
usa's
business.
the
dealers
can
stand
up
and
sue
arco.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
reason
that
this
court
has
identified
in
albrecht
for
finding
this
practice
illegal
is
the
coercion
on
the
dealers.
it
doesn't
look
to
the
level
of
the
particular
price.
it
has
said
that
it
is
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
because
the
antitrust
injury
inquiry
looks
to
whether
the
injury
flows
from
the
reason
the
particular
restraint
is
unlawful.
the
reason
the
restraint
is
unlawful
is
because
it
limits
the
freedom
of
the
dealers,
because
it
may
prevent
some
of
them
from
surviving,
because
it
may
prevent
some
of
them
from
offering
additional
services
to
consumers.
all
those
were
the
reasons
identified
in
albrecht.
that's
the
reason
this
is
illegal.
the
one
who
suffers
those
injuries
can
bring
suit,
and
that's
the
coerced
dealers.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--maybe
it
would
be
better
if
you
looked
at
the
price
by
itself
and
the
antitrust
violation.
the
violation,
the
reason
this
is
illegal,
is
the
coercion.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
the
price
that
arco
dealers
were...
at
which
they
were
selling
their
gasoline.
the
case
comes
to
this
court
on
the
assumption
that
no
predatory
pricing
is
involved.
the
price
is
a
lawful
price,
and
usa's
complaint
is
that
they're
forced
to
compete
against
that
lawful
price.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that's
precisely
correct,
and
that's
why
in
an
agreement
case,
horizontal
conspiracy
to
fix
prices,
we
don't
look
to
what
level
the
price
is.
it's
the
agreement
that
is
the
evil.
that's
why
the
particular
violation
is
met.
you
don't
look
to
the
level
of
the
prices.
so,
too,
here--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it...
it
is
two
groups.
the
person...
the
person
who
agreed
can
sue,
and
cases
are
brought
by
co-conspirators.
and
consumers,
the
ultimate
beneficiaries
of
the
antitrust
laws,
as
this
court
made
clear
in
the
reiter
case,
they
always
have...
suffer
antitrust
injury.
and,
in
fact,
as
a
theoretical
matter
i
think
consumers
could
sue
in
this
case,
although
it
would
be
hard
to
establish
damages,
consumers
who,
for
example,
preferred
credit
cards
and
additional
services.
but
it
is
the
dealers
who
have
in
the
past
brought
vertical
maximum
price
fixing
cases
to
this
court.
that
was
true
in
kiefer-stewart.
it
was
true
in
albrecht.
for
that
matter,
it's
true
in
the
other
vertical
restraint
cases
such
as
monsanto
and
sharp.
in
contrast,
the
ninth
circuit
majority
below
did
not,
and
usa
cannot,
point
to
a
single
case
in
which
the
court
has
allowed
a
competitor
of
the
coerced
dealer
to
bring
suit
complaining
about
the
coercion
his
rival
faces.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
have
argued
in
the
past,
your
honor,
to
this
court
that
these
types
of
agreements
should
be
evaluated
under
a
rule
of
reason
in
particular
cases
and
not
a
per
se
rule,
but
we
do
not
submit
that
albrecht
should
be
reconsidered
in
this
case.
it...
it
is
a
particularly
inappropriate
vehicle
for
such
reconsideration
because
the
court
has
to
reach
the
antitrust
injury
requirement
whether
the
violation
is
per
se
illegal
or
illegal
under
a
rule
of
reason.
and
that's
why
we
think
the
per
se
label
makes
absolutely
no
difference
whether
the
violation
is
per
se
illegal
or
illegal
under
a
rule
of
reason.
and
that's
why
we
think
the
per
se
label
makes
absolutely
no
difference
to
a
resolution
of
the
antitrust
injury
question.
the
per
se
label
goes
to
the
substantive
violation
under
the
sherman
act.
the
antitrust
injury
inquiry
goes
to
the
question
of
who
can
sue
to
remedy
that
violation,
in
this
case
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
per
se
violations
of
the
antitrust
laws
are
not
somehow
more
sinister
or
evil
than
rule
of
reason
violations.
the
per
se
label
simply
goes
to
the
evidentiary
showing
that
the
plaintiff
must
carry.
so
there
is
no
sound
policy
reason
for
making
an
exception
to
the
antitrust
injury
requirement
in
per
se
cases.
we
think
that
matsushita
made
clear
that
there
was
no
such
exception.
that
case
involved
horizontal
price
fixing
paradigm,
per
se
illegality,
and
yet
the
court
still
went
through
the
brunswick
antitrust
injury
analysis.
the
approach
of
the
majority
below,
we
think,
would
render
the
antitrust
injury
requirement
superfluous.
it
would,
for
example,
lead
to
a
different
result
in
cases
this
court
has
already
decided.
for
example,
in
cargill
the
allegation
was
that
a
merger
violated
the
antitrust
laws
and
that
the
merged
entity
would
be
able
to
lower
prices,
heightening
the
competition
faced
by
the
plaintiff.
the
court
nonetheless
held
there
was
no
antitrust
injury.
the
ninth
circuit
test
asks
whether
competition
in
a
market
has
been
affected,
and
if
you
are
a
competitor
then
you
have
standing.
applying
that
test
to
cargill
would
lead
to
a
different
result.
the
ninth
circuit's
approach,
as
judge
alarcon
noted
in
dissent,
really
reduces
simply
to
a
cause
in
fact
test.
but,
as
the
court
made
clear
in
brunswick,
there's
more
to
the
antitrust
injury
requirement
than
that.
the
bottom
line
here
is
that
usa
petroleum
liked
it
a
lot
better
when
it
did
not
have
to
compete
with
arco
dealers
on
the
basis
of
price
at
the
pump.
now
if
those
new
lower
prices
that
consumers
like
so
much
are
the
result
of
illegal
coercion
of
the
arco
dealers,
those
dealers
can
sue;
but
usa
petroleum,
a
competitor
of
those
dealers,
should
not
be
permitted
a
reward
of
treble
damages--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
believe
so,
your
honor,
with...
with
one--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
certainly
if
there
were...
if
there
were...
if
this--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
the
antitrust
injury
requirement
does
apply
in
horizontal
cases.
both
brunswick
and
cargill
were
horizontal
cases.
the
one
caveat
in
those
cases,
which
i
think
makes
this
easier,
is
that
it's
difficult
to
find
the
suitable
plaintiff.
here,
we
have
the
dealers
who
can
sue.
in
the
horizontal
case,
the
only
plaintiff,
i
think,
is
the
consumer
who
may,
at
least
in
the
short
term,
suffer
no
injury
at
all,
as
he
has
lower
prices.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
certainly
the
dealers
could...
could
sue
in
the
case
where
the
alleged
horizontal
agreement
is
at
the...
at
the
supplier
level.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
predatory
pricing
argument
would
be
more
credible
in
that
case,
although
i...
i
think
that
few
commentators
think
even
50
percent
of
the
market
is
enough
to
have
a
dangerous--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
the
absence
of
predatory
pricing,
there
is
no
antitrust
injury
other
than
by
the
coerced--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--again,
assuming
no
predatory
pricing,
which
is--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
the
answer
is
still
the
same.
