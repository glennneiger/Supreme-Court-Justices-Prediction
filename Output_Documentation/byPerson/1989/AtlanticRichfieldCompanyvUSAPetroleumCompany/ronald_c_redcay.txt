mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
this
case
creates
a
new
private
antitrust
cause
of
action
on
behalf
of
competitors,
the
least-favored
class
of
antitrust
plaintiff
to
challenge
price
cutting,
which
is
the
essence
of
competition,
and
without
requiring
the
competitor
to
prove
that
below
prices
pose
any
credible
threat
of
injury
to
the
consumer
interests
that
are
the
primary
concern
of
the
antitrust
laws.
specifically,
the
ninth
circuit
decision
permits
a
competitor
to
recover
profits
and
sales
lost
as
a
result
of
increased
competition
from
low
prices
imposed
on
its
rivals
by
vertical
maximum
price
fixing.
the
error
in
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
that
it
permits
an
antitrust
recovery
simply
because
a
plaintiff's
injury
is
causally
linked
to
an
antitrust
violation
without
requiring
a
determination
whether
the
injury
reflects
the
reasons
why
the
defendant's
conduct
violates
the
antitrust
laws
or
whether
allowing
such
a
recovery
would
be
inimical
to
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws.
as
was
also
true
of
the
competitor
claims
in
brunswick
and
in
cargill,
the
antitrust
recovery
sought
here
would
be
inimical
to
the
purposes
of
those
laws.
now
the
procedural
history
and
the
facts
are
rather
straightforward
and
are,
in
all
material
respects,
undisputed.
usa
filed
this
lawsuit
to
challenge
arco's
1982
marketing
program
designed
to
appeal
to
price-conscious
consumers.
at
that
time,
arco
decided
to
convert
its
marketing
strategy
from
one
of
higher
prices
for
more
service
and
credit
to
lower
prices
with
less
service
and
hopefully
larger
volumes.
arco,
in
effect,
emulated
a
marketing
strategy
that
theretofore
had
been
employed
mostly
by
the
independent
refiners.
arco
also
at
that
time
engaged
in
many
measures
to
cut
the
costs
of
refining
and
distributing
gasoline,
allowing
it
to
lower
its
wholesale
and
retail
prices.
the
resulting
lower
prices
both
at
arco-owned
and
operated
stations
and
at
independently
owned
and
operated
arco
brand
stations
were
tremendously
successful
in
attracting
new
customers,
and
the
market
share
of
arco
brand
gasoline
increased
from
approximately
12
percent
to
around
15
to
16
percent
in
a
little
over
a
year.
as
i
said,
it
was
this
increased
competition
that
led
usa
to
file
this
lawsuit.
usa's
complaint
alleges
a
broad
brush
attack
on
arco's
marketing
program.
usa
in
fact
alleged
that
arco's
changes
in
marketing
techniques
had
actually
caused
it
to
enter
an
entirely
distinct
market,
the
discount
gasoline
market,
of
which
usa
said
arco
already
had
a
45
percent
market
share.
usa
then
alleged
that
arco
was
attempting
to
monopolize
this
market
through
predatory
pricing
in
violation
of
sherman
act
section
2.
now
usa
also
alleged
sherman
act
section
1
price
fixing
because
much
of
the
gasoline
of
arco
that
was
sold
in
competition
with
usa
was
sold
not
by
arco
directly
but,
rather,
by
arco
independently-owned
arco
dealers
who
competed
with
usa.
usa
needed
section
1
in
order
to
hold
arco
responsible
for
the
low
prices
of
these
arco
dealers
because,
otherwise,
usa's
injury
was
too
remote
to
confer
standing
in
usa
to
challenge
the
allegedly
predatory
arco
prices.
usa,
therefore,
alleged
that
arco
had
coerced
its
dealers
to
pass
along
these
price
cuts
to
consumers
through
threatened
revocation
of
discounts,
reductions
of
supply
and
termination
of
franchises.
after
arco
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
both
sherman
act
counts,
usa
abandoned
its
discount
market
allegations
and
its
predatory
pricing
case.
it
dismissed
its
section
2
claim,
and
it
eschewed
any
intention
of
proving
predatory
pricing
in
support
of
its
section
1
claim.
and
usa
made
abundantly
clear
in
opposing
the
summary
judgment
motion
at
issue
here
that
it
was
not
going
to
prove
predatory
pricing
but,
rather,
that
all
it
needed
to
prove
was
that
arco
had
engaged
in
vertical
maximum
price
fixing
in
violation
of
section
1
and
that
price
fixing
was
the
cause,
in
fact,
of
usa's
injury.
now
this
contention,
which
is...
which
is
set
out
most
clearly
in
usa's
statement
of
genuine
issues
in
opposition
to
arco's
summary
judgment
motion,
framed
the
antitrust
injury
issue
that
the
district
court
decided
adverse
to
usa
and
which
the
ninth
circuit
then
decided
in
usa's
favor.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
what
is
clear
as
it
comes
to
your
honors
is
that
there...
there
was
vertical
maximum
price
fixing
assumed
here
and
that
usa
was
injured
as
a
result
of
the
low
pricing
that
resulted
from
the
vertical
maximum
price
fixing.
what
is
not--
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
--what
is
not--
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
--it...
by
coercive
agreement.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
what
is
alleged
in
the
complaint
is
that
arco
used
coercion
to
cause
those
dealers
to
succumb
to
that
coercion
and
charge
prices
lower
than
the
dealers
otherwise
would
have
charged
but
for
their...
but
for
the
coercion
and
their
succumbing
to
the
coercion,
which
in
fact
is--
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
--under...
under...
it
is
an
agreement...
it
is
a
combination
conspiracy
in
violation
of
section
1.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
yes.
this
is
a...
this
is
a
case
like
brunswick
and
cargill
and
other
antitrust
cases--
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
--for
purposes
of
deciding
this
issue,
there
was
an
assumption
of
a
section
1
violation.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
the
problem
is
with
the
contention
and
that
theory
with
these
two
facts
undisputed
doesn't
pass
muster
under
either
of
the
two
standards
set
forth
in
brunswick
for
determining
antitrust
injury,
each
of
which
serves
an
important
antitrust
policy
of
avoiding
overdeterrence
by
making
sure
that
the
treble...
the
scope
of
the
treble
damage
remedy
that
is...
that
is
imposed
on
any
particular
violation
be
related
to
the
fact...
that
which
makes
the
conduct
unlawful.
usa's
claim
fails
at
the
threshold
level
because
its
lost
profits
and
sales
are
not
the
type
of
injury
that
the
rule
against
vertical
maximum
price
fixing
was
intended
to
prevent.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
i
think
albrecht
obviously
is
the
court's...
court's
articulation
that...
that
a
coercive
vertical
maximum
price-fixing
agreement
is,
per
se,
illegal.
albrecht
does
not
deal
with
or
address
the
particular
antitrust
injury
issue
that
is
presented
here.
i
think
that
the
way
albrecht
bears
on
the
issue
is
to
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
this
court
most
recently
reaffirmed
in
sharp
that
vertical
maximum
price
fixing
involved
an
agreement
to
force
the
dealer
to
adhere
to
a
specific
price.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
that
albrecht,
which
of
course
did
involve
a
claim
by
a
coerced
dealer,
or
there
it
was
a
coerced
distributor
of
newspapers,
is
perfectly
consistent
with
our
position.
our
view
is
that
because
it
is
the
coercion
that
makes
vertical
maximum
price
fixing
unlawful,
that
is
the,
to
use
the
words
of
brunswick,
that
is
the
vat.
the
coercion
is
the
vat
which
makes
the
conduct
unlawful,
and
as
a
result
of
that
the
coerced
dealer,
such
as
the
plaintiff
in
albrecht,
certainly
satisfies
the
threshold
brunswick
standard,
and
the
coerced
dealer
is
a
proper
private
plaintiff
to
bring
this
kind
of
a
cause
of
action,
and
that...
we
take
no
issue
with
either
the
per
se
rule
or
the
antitrust
injury
of
the
coerced
dealer.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
that's...
if
the
dealer
was
suing,
what
we
would
have
to
do
is
defend
the
case--
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
--we
would...
we
would...
what
we
would
do,
your
honor,
is
to
prove
that...
that
arco
didn't
engage
in
coercive
price
fixing.
but
we're
here
on
a
summary
judgment
because
the
wrong
plaintiff
is
here.
usa,
in
effect,
if
i
can...
if
i
can
make
it
this
way,
usa
is
attempting
to
usurp
a
rule
that
this
court
has
created
to
protect
the
coerced
dealer's
pricing
discretion
and
is
trying
to
apply
it
to
a
wholly
different
injury
that's
never
been
identified
in
any
of
this
court's
opinion
as
a
reason
for
imposing
illegality.
another
way
of
looking
at
it
is
that
usa
is
taking
a
square
peg,
its
claim
as
a
competitor
of
a
coerced
dealer,
and
is
trying
to
put
it
into
a
round
hole
the...
that
rule
against
vertical
maximum
price
fixing.
now
brunswick
is
intended
to
prevent
just
that
kind
of
a
squeeze,
allowing
only
the
round
hole,
the
coerced
dealer's
claim,
like
the
plaintiff
in
albrecht,
into
the
round
hole
in
order
not
to
divorce
the
private
antitrust
remedy
from
the
purposes
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
if
i
were...
if
i
were
sitting--
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
--i
find
more...
when
i
read
the
opinions
in
albrecht,
i
will
say
that
i
find
more
persuasive
justice
harlan's
dissent,
and
i
do
believe
that
in
light
of
gte
v.
sylvania
and
matsushita
and
cargill
and
more
recent
decisions
of
the
court,
i
think
that
if
the
question
of
albrecht
were
squarely
presented,
that
i
think
that
albrecht
should
be
overruled
and
that
the
vertical
maximum
price
fixing
should
turn
on
the
rule
of
reason
and
not
a
per
se
rule.
but
i...
i
have
the
comfort
of
not
being
here
arguing
that
particular
issue
today.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
well,
the
interesting
thing
is
that--
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
--certainly.
in
fact,
it
is
my
position
that
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
vertical
maximum
price
fixing
is
to
be
judged
under
a
per
se
rule
or
a
rule
of
reason
is
irrelevant
to
the
antitrust
injury
issue
that's
presented
here.
under
a
per
se
rule,
the
anti...
the
procompetitive
effects
of
price
ceilings
that
result
from
vertical
maximum
price
fixing
are
ignored
for
purposes
of
determining
illegality
because
those
procompetitive
effects
are
presumably
by
law
ignored...
they're
outweighed
by
the
anticompetitive
effects
on
the
coerced
dealer.
under
a
rule
of
reason,
the
procompetitive
effects
must
be
balanced
against
the
anticompetitive
effects
to
determine
if
the
conduct
is
unreasonable
and,
therefore,
illegal.
what
is
important
for
antitrust
injury
purposes,
however,
is
that
under
either
of
those
scenarios,
the
effects
on
competitors
of
the
coerced
dealers
are
procompetitive
by
definition;
and,
therefore,
it
really
doesn't
matter
to
me
whether
you
apply
a
rule
of
reason
or
a
per
se
rule.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
well,
what
is
alleged
here
is...
is--
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
--right.
assuming
there
is
a
price-fixing
agreement,
then
obviously
arco
has
violated
the
law,
and
arco
is
subject
to
all
the...
all
the
sanctions
that
are
available,
criminal
sanctions
as
well
as
civil
sanctions
by
the
class
of
plaintiffs
against...
for
whom
the
rule
is
designed
to
protect.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
that...
that's
correct.
but
what
is
involved
here
isn't
drawing
agreements.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
correct.
and
the
problem
i...
the
problem
in
arguing
any
standing
or
antitrust
injury
issue
is
that
one
assumes
the
violation.
we
obviously
dispute
that
any
violation
occurred,
but...
but
what
you
need
for
purposes
of
standing
or
antitrust
injury
or
these
doctrines
that
are
designed
to
identify
who
may
properly
bring
a
claim,
you
need
some
issue
that
will
be
available
to
summary
adjudication
and
to
quick
determination.
and
so--
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
--correct.
but
what
is
involved...
the
problem
we
have
here
is
a
case
where
the
evidence
is
highly
ambiguous.
what
arco
wanted
to
do,
as
i
indicated
in
my
statement
of
facts,
was
it
wanted
to
lower
its
gasoline
prices.
it
wanted
to
become
more
competitive.
and
because
it
distributes
through
independent
dealers,
it
had...
it
was
in
a
situation
where
it
had
to
come
up
with
a
situation
to
get
those
prices
down
to
dealers.
and
so
it
lowered...
it
lowered
the
wholesale
price,
but
that's
about
all
it
could
do,
and
then
it
tried
to
persuade,
as
the
courts
have
made
very
clear
that
arco
can
engage
in
exposition,
persuasion
and
argument
to
get
its
dealers
to
lower
the
prices.
and
we
believe
that's
all
arco
did,
that's
all
arco's
people
were
counseled
to
do.
the
question
we
will
have
to
try
if
we
ever
have
to
try
it
is
whether
that
exposition,
persuasion
and
argument
went
over
the
line
and
went
into
coercion.
we
don't
believe
it
did,
but
in
any
event
we
certainly
don't
believe
that,
as
i
said,
the
square
peg
should
be
allowed
to
recover
because,
otherwise,
arco
would
be
responsible
in
treble
damages
not
only
to
all
the
dealers
they
allegedly
coerced
but
to
usa,
to
shell,
to
mobil,
to
chevron.
and
it's
that
kind
of
broad
exposure
which
rules
like
brunswick
are
designed
to
prevent.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
that...
that
the
dealer
would
have
the
ability
to
challenge
that
but
not
a
competitor
of
the
dealer.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
that...
and
that's
correct,
and
that...
that
is
the
reason
for
making
those
illegal,
but
it
is
not
a
reason
for
allowing
any
particular
plaintiff
who
might
be
able
to
say
that
he
was
injured
as
a
cause
in
fact
of
that
to
be
able
to
recover
treble
damages,
which
is
a
very
potent
remedy.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
the...
the
only
reason
that
i
care
and
i
take
the
position
is
because
albrecht
is
on
the
books,
and
i
think
as
long
as
albrecht
is
on
the
books
that
would
be
a
more
difficult
case.
and
i
was...
i
was...
i'm
not
arguing
to
overrule
albrecht.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
there's...
there
are
two
different
articulations
in
brunswick.
one
is
the...
if
whether
or
not
the
conduct
is
that
which
the
law
is
intended
to
prevent;
and
the
other
is
whether
or
not
consumer
welfare
is
injured.
i
think
in...
in
your
case,
justice
scalia,
your...
if
both
of
them
are
required,
then
you're
right.
i...
we
have
an
easier
case
because
i
think
here
our...
our
defense
satisfies
both
of
those
standards.
thank
you.
mr.
ronald
c.
redcay
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
begin
with
the
case
that
mr.
blecher
says
is
controlling,
and
that's
matsushita.
matsushita
was
a
horizontal
price-fixing
case
in
violation
of
sherman
act
section
1,
but
the
plaintiffs
in
that
case
did
not
even...
and
obviously
the
plaintiffs
were
injured
as
a
result
of
the
alleged
horizontal
price
fixing.
but
the
plaintiffs
there
didn't
contend
that
they
could...
they
could
recover
simply
by
showing
a
price
fixing
agreement
and
cause,
in
fact,
injury.
they
recognized
that
they
needed
to
prove
a
horizontal
conspiracy
to
engage
in
predatory
pricing,
and
this
court
wrote
a
landmark
opinion
addressing
when
you
can
have
predatory
pricing
and
when
you
cannot
because
all
parties,
including
the
court,
recognized
that
only
such
a
conspiracy
could
cause
the
plaintiffs
there
cognizable
injury.
and
what
the
court
said
in
that
case
and
then
reaffirmed
in
cargill
was
that...
that
the
only
time
you
can
have
an
antitrust
recovery
is
where
the
competitors'
and
consumers'
interests
are
coincident,
and
those
interests
are
only
coincident
when
the
low
prices
pose
the
kind
of
danger
of
obtaining
the
power
that
can
ultimately
lead
to
higher
prices.
so
i
think
that
matsushita
also
is
a
controlling
case,
and
i
think
it
supports
our
position.
