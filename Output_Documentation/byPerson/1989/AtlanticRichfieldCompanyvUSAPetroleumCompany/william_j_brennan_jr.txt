justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
petitioner,
atlantic
richfield
company
an
integrated
oil
company,
increased
its
retail
gasoline
sales
and
market
share
by
encouraging
the
dealers
to
match
the
prices
of
independents
such
as
respondent,
usa
petroleum
company
which
competes
directly
with
the
dealers
of
petitioner
at
the
retail.
when
usa’s
sales
dropped,
usa
sued
the
petitioner,
atlantic,
in
the
district
court
charging
that
this
was
a
vertical
maximum
price
fixing
scheme
that
constituted
a
conspiracy
in
restraint
of
trade
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
district
court,
however,
granted
summary
judgment
to
arco
holding
that
usa
could
not
satisfy
the
anti-trust
injury
requirement
for
purposes
of
a
private
damages
suit
under
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
because
it
was
unable
to
show
what
arco’s
prices
were
predatory.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
holding
that
injuries
resulting
from
a
vertical
non-predatory
maximum
price
fixing
agreement
could
constitute
anti-trust
injury.
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
a
vertical
maximum
price
fixing
conspiracy
to
be
in
violation
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act
must
result
in
predatory
pricing
to
cause
a
competitor
anti-trust
injury.
justice
stevens
joined
by
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
