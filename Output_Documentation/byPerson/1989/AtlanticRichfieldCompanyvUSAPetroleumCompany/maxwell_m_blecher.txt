mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
has
been
presented
with
four
distinct
analytical
approaches
to
resolving
this
question
of
antitrust
injury,
and
before
i
deal
with
those
four
analytical
approaches
i'd
like
briefly
to
place
the
litigation
in
its
proper
context,
which
i
don't
believe
mr.
redcay,
in
fairness,
has
done.
what's
alleged
in
the
complaint
and
what's
assumed
to
be
the
factual
predicate
for
the
appeal
process
through
the
ninth
circuit
and
here
is
that
arco
organized
and
enforced
a
vertical
price-fixing
combination
with
its
dealers
to
eliminate
the
independent
segment
of
the
gasoline
selling
market
by
setting
a
price
either
below
the
market
level
or
below
some
standard,
of
course,
which
was
not
set
out
with
specificity
in
the
complaint.
that's
what
they
were
charged
with.
now,
arco--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--i
withdrew,
mr.
chief
justice,
my
claim
of
section
2
under
the
sherman
act.
it
is
absolutely
incorrect,
and
i
invite
the
court's
attention
respectfully
to
the
transcript
of
the
argument
before
district
judge
gray
in
october
of
1986
where
we
told
him
it
wasn't
necessary
to
reach
the
question
of
predation
because
if
they
applied
this
court's
decision
in
matsushita
it
was
only
necessary
in
a
section
1
case
that
we
show
the
level
of
price
to
be
below
the
prevailing
market
price.
but
there's
no
place
where
we
ever
withdrew
the
claim
of
predatory
price
which
is
alleged
in
the
complaint,
as
distinct
from
the
entire
requisite
elements
of
monopolization.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
don't
believe
that's
true
because
i
believe
if
you
look
at
the
decision
of
judge
gray
which
is
in
the
petition--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--the
ninth
circuit
was
responding
to
judge
gray's
opinion.
what
judge
gray
found
was
that
we
failed
to
prove
a
properly
defined
relevant
market
in
which
there
was
a
dangerous
probability
of
monopolization.
in
light
of
those
facts,
he
concluded
that
we
could
not
establish
the
requisite
antitrust
injury.
that's
what
he
found,
and
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit,
as
a
shorthand
expression
in
my
view,
was
talking
about
predation.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes.
well,
now
we
get
into
the
semantic
question
of
what
becomes
predatory.
i
told
the
district
court
and
we
told
the
ninth
circuit,
and
i
believe
the
predicate
of
their
decision
was
that
we
were
talking
about
setting
a
price
below
the
market
level.
but
at
not
time
did
we
actually
say
we
can't
prove
price
predation
by
a...
by
a
below
cost
standard.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
am
defending
the
ninth
circuit,
and
i'm--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--the
point
is--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--let's
assume
no
predation.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
absolutely.
by
setting
the
price
below
the
market
level.
that's
where
we're
coming
at.
now...
now
arco's
response
to
this...
there's
four
separate
responses,
and
let's
take
them
in
some
order.
arco
is
the
party
to
the
case.
what
they
say
is
required
is
that
we
prove
full
monopolization.
in
their
view,
we
have
to
prove
a
dangerous
probability
of...
successful
monopolization
achieved
by
pricing
below
some
appropriate
level
of
cost.
now
that's
impossible
to
square
with
this
court's
decision
in
copperweld,
because
in
copperweld
the
court
said
plainly,
unequivocally,
whatever
the
requirements
of
section
1
are,
they
don't
involve
monopolization
under
section
2.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
but...
but
i
submit
to
you
that
you
can't
possibly
reread...
rewrite
section
1
to
include
the
elements
of
monopolization
under
section
2
under
the
rubric
or
guise
that
this
is
antitrust
injury.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
they're
saying
we
have
standing,
i
think,
justice
scalia.
i
think
they're
saying
we
don't
have...
haven't
shown
antitrust
injury
unless
we
take
the
simple
price-fixing
combination
under
section
1
and
under
the
rubric
of
antitrust
injury
prove
each
required
element
of
section
2,
which
is
the
low
cost
pricing
and
a
dangerous
probability
of
monopolization.
now
by
doing
that,
they
use
the
rubric
or
the
guise
of
antitrust
injury
and
they
reconvert
this
violation
into
a
section
2
violation.
that's
why
we
abandoned
the
section
2
violation,
because
we
couldn't
prove
a
relevant
market
in
a
dangerous
probability
monopolization.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
that's
totally
illogical
because
if
the
antitrust
laws
have
the
solicitude,
as
this
court
has
frequently
said,
it
should
be
for
interbrand
competition.
here
is
a
case
in
which
resell
price
maintenance
has
been
used
as
a
vehicle
to
distort
interbrand
competition,
and--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--i
believe
it
is,
your
honors.
i
read...
sharp
made
no
distinction
when
it
talked
about
vertical
resale
price
maintenance.
it
equated,
as
i
read
it,
dr.
miles
on
the
one
hand,
which
has
traditionally
been
treated
as
a
minimum
case,
with
albrecht
on
the
other
and
made
no
distinction
and
said
both
facilitate
cartelization
and
both
remain,
per
se,
illegal.
so
i
don't...
i
don't
recognize...
i
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
recognize
a
distinction.
but
my
point
is
arco's
argument
would
require
us
to
prove
under
a
guise
after
you
find
an
antitrust
violation
that
is,
per
se,
illegal.
arco
comes
along
and
says
to
prove
antitrust
injury
you
now
have
to
prove
a
dangerous
probability
monopolization,
thereby
engrafting
the
requirements
of
section
2
into
a
simple
section
1
case.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
possibly
square
that
with
cargill
or
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
treble
damage
action
in
doing
that.
now,
the
newspapers
in
their
amicus
brief
have
a
different
solution.
they
want
you
to
repeal
albrecht,
and
they
want
to
adapt
a
rule
of
reason.
i
must
say
that's
a
more
reasonable
position
than
arco's,
but
it's
wrong
for
the
reasons
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
expressed
most
recently
in
sharp,
just
before
that
in
the
324
liquor
case
involving
duffy,
and
before
that
in
a
sweeping
discussion
about
the...
about
the
vice
of
price
fixing
in
the
maricopa
county
case.
i
don't
think
we're
ready
yet,
and
that
after...
after
nearly
100
years
of
rejecting
low
fixed
prices
as
procompetitive,
i
don't
think
we're
yet
ready
to
abandon
the
per
se
rule
that
all
price
fixing
should
be
condemned.
now,
the
government
has
a
fourth
approach--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--excuse
me,
the
third
approach.
excuse
me.
the
government
has
offered
a
third
approach,
and
that
third
approach
is
that
we
don't
need...
they
don't
endorse
arco's
position
that
we
need
to
prove
the
elements
of
monopolization.
and,
of
course,
i
want
to
repeat
the
reason
we
voluntarily
withdrew
the
monopoly
claims,
because
of
the
recognition
that
we
could
not
prove
the
dangerous
probability
of
monopolization
in
any
properly
defined
relevant
market.
now
that
comes
back
to
become,
in
arco's
view
and
in
judge
gray's
view,
the
basis
for
dismissal
of
the
section
1
case.
that's
totally
illogical
and
fails
to
recognize
the
time
honored
distinction
between
sherman
1
and
sherman
2.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
the
u.s.
position
is
that
we
don't
have
to
prove
the
full...
panoply
of
facts
necessary
to
show
a
section
2
violation.
we
simply
have
to
show
that
the
price
is
below
cost,
and
in
that
argument
the
government
presumes
that
there
is
some
level
of
conspiratorial
or
combined
vertical
price
fixing
that's
good.
it
leaves
open
the
question
of
whether
albrecht
and
sharp
survive
as
condemning
all
vertical
price
fixing,
and
it
ignores
the
language
of
matsushita,
which
is
the
argument
we
made
to
judge
gray,
and
the
argument
we
made
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
argument
that
i
respectfully
make
here.
i
believe
the
court--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--i
believe
my
answer
to
that
is
that
if
any...
if
the
court
has
solicited
about
the
true
interbrand
effect
of
price
fixing,
the
distortion
of
the...
of
the...
of
the
marketplace
in
terms
of
interbrand
competition,
our
client
should
be
the
favored
plaintiff
to
bring
this
kind
of
case,
not
the
dealer.
the
dealer
is
at
least
a
co-conspirator.
the
dealer,
his
limitation
and
the
limitation
of
albrecht
is
that
it
applies
only
to
intrabrand
competition.
but
in
this
circumstance,
usa
is
alleging
a
restraint
in
the
interbrand
market,
and
as
a
consequence
to
that
it
ought
to
be
the
favored
plaintiff.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes,
but
not
if
they're
arrived
at
by
a
grievant.
we're
not
against
low
prices,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
that's
true,
but
by
agreement,
not
by
the
marketplace.
we're
totally
willing
to
accept
what
happened
in
the
marketplace,
and
let
me
give
you
just
some
illustrations
of
what
arco
could
do.
it
could
simply
lower
the
price
to
its
dealers,
the
wholesale
price
and
hope
that
some
of
that
gets
passed
on
into
the
marketplace.
it
could
lower
the
price
of
its
vertically
integrated
stations
that
it
owns
and
hope
that
has
an
effect
on
depressing
price.
it
could
lower
dealer
rents
and
hope
that
that
loosens
up
the
market.
but
what
they
can't
do,
consistent
with
the
edicts
of
this
court,
is
sit
down
with
their
dealers
or
coerce
them
by
one
means
or
another
and
organize
a
price-fixing
conspiracy
that,
to
me,
has
all
the
earmarks
of
the
parke-davis
case.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
but
then
who?
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
ask
the
question
respectfully.
then
who?
the
government
doesn't
think
this
is
a
violation.
they
think
it's
good.
the
dealers
are
not
the
ones
likely
to
sue
because
it...
we
don't
even
know
that
that
they
have
sustained
any
damage.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes,
because
he
was
terminated.
but
if
a
dealer
is
not
terminated
and
arco
maintains
their
margin
of
profit,
they
may
not
even
have
a
respectable
compensable
damage
claim.
so
why
would
we
want
to
rely
on
the
dealers
to
bring
this
case?
and
their
concern,
as
i
suggest
to
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
much
narrower.
they're
concerned
only
with
the
price
of
arco
stations.
our
client
and
others
similarly
situated
want
to
be
accorded
the
right
to
attack
this
kind
of
conduct
because
it
affects
competition--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--absolutely.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
absolutely.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
they
did.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
they...
we
likely
wouldn't
have
been,
but
that
doesn't
mean,
justice
white,
that...
that
arco
is
without
some
means
to
force
lower
prices--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--to
try
to
force
lower
forces
by
legitimate
tactics.
why
should
there
be
solicitude
when
counsel
gets
up
and
acknowledges
that
they
engaged
in
an
organized
plan
to
break
the
sherman
act?
why
should
anybody
have
any
solicitude
about
who
gets
to
collect
here
as
long
as--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--no.
i'm
saying
that
this
plaintiff
is
certainly
within
the
penumbra
of
protection
of
a
law
which
says
you
shouldn't
fix
prices
because
you
distort
markets
by
doing
that,
and
we
operate
within
that
market,
and
we
were
directly
injured
by
it,
and
it
seems
to
me
to
stand
antitrust
injury
on
its
head
to
say
that
you
inject
into
the
analysis
questions
of
predation
or
questions
of
section
2
law.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
then
we'd
have
a
section
2
case,
justice
kennedy.
and
then
the
arguments
that
copperweld
talk
about,
about
stricter
scrutiny,
would
justifiably
apply.
i
totally
agree
that
section
2
conduct
requires
greater
scrutiny
than
section
1
conduct.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
if
they
were
totally
vertically
integrated,
we'd
be
talking
section
2
law,
and
we'd
be
talking
monopolization.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
that
is
correct.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
think
that's
correct.
and
then
we'd
be
talking
section
2.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
think
that's
right.
that's
why
we
gave
up
the
section
2
case,
was
the
recognition
that
we
could
not
carve
out
a
properly
defined
relevant
market,
and
in
the
properly
defined
relevant
market
there
was
no
dangerous
probability
of
monopolization.
that's
why
we
gave
up.
now
those
concessions
somehow
now
become
engrafted
upon
what
we
have
to
prove
to
win
under
section
1.
i
have
to
say
to
you
in
all
candor
that's
ridiculous
to
say
section
1
is
now
become
section
2.
what
difference
is
there?
and
that's
what
we
argue.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
then
i'd
just
bring
a
discrimination
case.
[laughter]
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
of...
of
course.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
of
course,
but
then
you've
got
to
define
what
it
is
that
price
fixing
does
in
the
marketplace,
and
what
price
fixing
does
is
it
distorts
the
market.
vertical
price
fixing
eliminates
all
retail
competition.
if
our
plaintiff
is
a
participant
in
that
market
by
anybody's
standards,
even
the
dissent
in
mccready,
we're
a
participant
in
a
market
which
was...
in
which
injury
was
inflicted,
and
we
do
have
standing,
and
the
injury
that
we
sustain
is
antitrust
injury.
there
can't
be
any
question
about
that.
it's
only
when
you
begin
to
engraft
these
additional
requirements
on
it
that
distort
the
meaning
of
brunswick
that
has
given,
if
you
will
give
me
the
liberty
to
tell
you,
it's
given
district
judges
a
license
to
toss
antitrust
cases
out
by
the
right
and
left
flank.
and
that's
the--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--the
fourth
one
is
our
position,
your
honor,
which
is
really
your
position,
the
position
of
this
court
in
matsushita.
in
matsushita,
the
court
said
in
footnote
8
that
unlike
section
2
which
requires...
apparently
requires
some
below
cost
standard,
some
standard
of
pricing
below
an
appropriate
level
of
cost
which
has
yet
to
be
defined,
section
1
is
violated
by
an
agreement
to
price
to
eliminate
a
competitor
if
the
price
is
either
below
the
cost
standard
or
below
the
prevailing
market
price.
now
that's
precisely
what
we
alleged
in
this
complaint,
precisely
what
the
district
judge
found
was
unacceptable.
it
is
exactly
what
we
believe
the
majority
of
the
ninth
circuit
said
was
acceptable--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--absolutely.
that
was
the
predicate.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
think
that--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--i
think,
justice
stevens,
they
appreciated
that
when
they
set
up
the
factual
predicate
at
the
beginning
of
the
decision
and
at
859
f.
2d
696
the
majority
says,
"usa
complains
that
it
has
suffered
financial
losses
and
is
being
driven
out
of
the
market
by
arco's
illegal
price
fixing."
"this
is
the
type
of
injury
that
the
antitrust
laws
were
meant
to
prevent."
yes.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
the
allegation
was
they
intended
to
drive
the
price-cutting
independent
segment
of
the
market
out
of
business.
that
was
the
allegation,
and
we
are
in
that
class
of
price-cutting
independents,
and
that's
what
i
believe
was
the
factual
predicate
that's
set
up
at
the
outset
of
the
opinion,
and
i
believe--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--yes.
i
think
what
the
district
court
said
unequivocally
in
a
very
short
statement
was
that
if
we
could
not
prove
the
requisite
elements
of
monopolization
we
couldn't
show
antitrust
standing
because
the
ninth
circuit
accepted
the
argument
that
the
agreement
to
fix
low
prices
was
procompetitive
and,
therefore,
the
only
way
it
crosses
the
line
and
becomes
anticompetitive
is
when
there's
a
threat
of
monopolization.
and
what
that
does
is
it
sets
up
a
totally
separate
analytical
approach
to
antitrust
injury.
on
the
one
hand,
we've
already
proven
a
per
se
violation
from
which...
which
means
that
there's
presumed
anticompetitive
effects.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
and
now...
now
the
district
court
comes
along
and
says
that
isn't
enough;
you
can't
rely
on
that
anticompetitive
effect.
over
here
under
the
rubric
of
antitrust
injury
you've
got
to
prove
it
all
over
again,
and
what
i'm
going
to
make
you
prove
now
is
that
there
was
a
dangerous
probability
of
monopolization.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes.
the
program,
the
contention,
the
allegation
is
that
it
was
aimed
at...
at
the
independent
segment,
that
arco
wanted--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--i
don't
know
that...
that
it
would
be
a
defense
if,
in
fact,
they
engaged
in
the
same
conduct
against
independents.
what
we
say
is
they...
they
selected--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--i
think
you've
got
a
fact
controversy.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
yes.
they
zoned
the
market
and
went...
targeted
the
independents,
and
those
are
the
places
they
took
the
price
down
to
below
market
where
we
couldn't
survive.
that
was
the
program.
in
a
nutshell,
that's
the
way
it
was
alleged
and
understood,
and
it's
in
that
context
that
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
says,
well,
if
that's
what
you're
alleging
and
they
took
the
price
under
the
market,
you
don't
need
to
show
it's
predatory
because
that
complies
with
the
first
leg
of
this
court's
statement
in
footnote
8
in
matsushita
which
says
that
if
there's
a
conspiracy
to
drive
people
out
of
business
by
charging
a
price
below
the
market
level,
that's...
that's
antitrust
injury,
and
you
said
it
point
blank.
and
i...
and
i
must
wonder...
i
must
wonder
why
we're
here,
then,
because
this
case
falls
squarely
within
the
first
clause
of
the
matsushita
statement
of
antitrust
injury.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
well,
i...
i
can't...
i
can't
substitute
myself
for
judges
reinhardt
and
nelson,
but
i'll
tell
you
what
i
think
is
on
their
head.
i
think
that
the
seventh
circuit
in
jack
walter
and
indiana
grocery
said
that
there
can
be
good
price
fixing.
i
shocked
by
judge
posner's
statement,
more
or
less
repeated
by
judge
flaum,
that
price
fixing
can
be
procompetitive;
it's
a
legitimate
competitive
weapon.
and
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
wanted
to
say
to
the
extent
that
you're
citing
seventh
circuit
law
that
says
price
fixing
can
be
good,
we
reject
it;
until
the
supreme
court
tells
us
otherwise,
all
price
fixing
across
the
board
is
bad.
now,
it
was
a
gratuity
in
that
sense.
it
was
a
gratuity
in
that
sense,
but
that's
the
case
they
relied
on.
and
if
you
look
back
at
judge
gray's
decision,
the
only
case
he
really
cites
for
this
proposition
to...
to
throw
us
out
is
jack
walter.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
no,
i
think
they
had
to
get
over
the
seventh
circuit's
statement
that
predatory
pricing
was
required
in
order
to
accept
if
you...
if
you
define
predatory
as
some
measure
of
cost.
i
think
they
had
to
get
around
that
to...
to
say
that
we
could
win
by
showing
a
below
market
price,
which
is
what
we
alleged
and
claimed
we
were
going
to
be
able
to
prove.
now,
there's
been
some
comment,
justice
o'connor
and
others,
on
albrecht.
i...
this
isn't
the
case
to
overrule
albrecht,
and
i
don't
believe
albrecht
should
be
overruled,
but
i
submit
to
you
if
it
is
and
we
go
to
a
rule
of
reason
test,
we
subsume
the
arguments
that
arco
has
made
by
a
rule
of
reason
analysis;
and
we
certainly
have
to
get
affirmed,
because
all
that
would
say
is
instead
of
having
a
presumption
of
illegality
under...
under
the
per
se
rule,
that
we
would
have
to
prove
the
actual
anticompetitive
effect
of
the
planned
program.
and
if
we
did
that
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
fact
finder,
once
again
the
injury,
antitrust
injury,
to
this
plaintiff
would
flow
from
that
determination
of
antitrust...
anticompetitive
effect.
what
i'm
telling
you
is
that
there
is
no
separate
analytical--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--the
elimination
of
a
subset
of
sellers
who
offered
price
competitive
and
the
elimination
of
price
competition
at
the
retail
level.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
absolutely.
and
if
we
prove
that,
even
if
albrecht
were
out
the
window,
it
wouldn't
really
make
any
difference
at
this
level.
it
would
simply
mean
that
we'd
have
a
longer,
more
arduous
trial
with
a
lot
more
jury
instructions.
but
if
we
were
to
persuade
the
finder
of
fact
that
there
was
an
anticompetitive
effect,
the
injury
of
which
we're
complaining
flows
inexorably
from
that.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
and
therefore,
we
don't
have
a
different
standard
of
antitrust
injury,
whether
it's
per
se
or
rule
of
reason.
but--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--if
done
by
combination--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--by
unilateral
conduct,
not
by
combination.
i
can
hardly
see
this
court
saying
to
industry
we'll
let
you
get
together
to
knock
your
weak
competitors
out
of
business.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
of
course,
there
would
still
be
a
combination,
and
the
only
difference
then
is
we'd
have
to
prove
what
the
actual
marketplace
effect
was,
and
then...
and
if
the
elimination
of
the
competitors
is
deemed
to
have
an
actual
or
prospective
anticompetitive
effect,
we
could
win.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
i
must
respectfully
suggest
that
engrafting
section
2
under
section
1
eliminates.
what
you've
just
said
is
there
can't
be
a
conspiracy
to
restrain
trade
that
isn't
the
equivalent
of
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize.
i...
i...
i
would
think
that's
not
analytically
correct.
there
can
be
something
that
restrains
trade
and
affects
competition
but
not
in
the
way
that's
likely
to
produce
monopoly
power.
the
whole
purpose
of
section
1
was
to
stop
those
kinds
of
activities
before
they
reach
the
apex
of
monopolization
under
section
2.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
the
accepted
facts,
justice
stevens,
because
there's
no
record
except
the
complaint,
really--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--the
alleged
and
accepted
facts
for
this
purpose
is
that
we
lost
sales
and
profits
as
a
consequence
and
closed
stations
as
a
consequence
of
our
inability
to
charge
a
price
as
low
as
arco
was
charging.
arco
was
charging
at
retail
less
than
what
it
costs
us--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--i
think
we
have
a
dollar
damage
number,
but
i
can't
frankly
remember
what
it
is.
it's
very--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--it's
very
substantial,
and
the
company
was
forced
to
constrict
itself
during
this
period.
and
the
record
is
clear,
and
the
undisputed
fact
are
that...
that
literally
dozens
of
independent
marketers
and
refiners
went
out
of
business
as
a
consequence
of
this,
and
many
others
shifted
their
operations
from
independent
to
the
arco
flag.
so
the
effect
of
this
in
the
marketplace,
at
least
in
california,
was
very
substantial,
which
is
why
i
believe,
justice
scalia,
we
can
show
anticompetitive
effect
wholly
apart
from
the
elements
of
monopolization.
this
has
had
a
very
significant
effect
on
the
marketplace,
and
what
i
want
to
suggest
to
you
is
if
in
any
way
you
condone
this,
in
any
way
you
say
this
cannot
be
reached
by
people
directly
in
the...
the
target
of
and
within
the
impact
zone,
i
think
you
can
reasonably
expect
that
chevron
and
mobil
and
shell
are
not
going
to
sit
still
as
they
have
on
the
sidelines
probably
in
obedience
to
this
court's
decisions.
i
think
they're
going
to
join
the
fray
and
sign
up
their
dealers,
and
what
we're
going
to
have
is
a
cartelized
industry
which
will
facilitate
some
kind
of
horizontal
price
movement.
and
down
the
road,
no
one
will
know
whether
they're
raising
the
price
or
lowering
the
price
because
there
won't
be
a
market
price.
there
won't
be
the
interplay
of
retailers
now
uncontrolled
that
we
see
setting
a
market
price
today.
it
will
be
eliminated.
and
so
there's
an
enormous
danger
here
to
sanction
this
kind
of
approach
to
vertical
price
fixing.
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
well,
they
do--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--well,
they...
i
didn't
say
that,
and
i
think
that
question--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--no.
i
don't
know
that
the
persuasion/coercion
distinction
has
yet
been
endorsed
by
this
court,
and
there's,
i
believe,
a
difference--
mr.
maxwell
m.
blecher
--mainly
at
the
expense
of
the
independents,
justice
stevens.
i
think
the
evidence
will
show
mainly
at
the
expense
of
the
independents,
most
of
whom
are
gone
and
in
the
graveyard.
this
program
worked
beautifully.
it
accomplished
exactly
what
they
wanted
it
to
do.
well,
it's
for
all
those
reasons
that
i
think
that
matsushita
and
the
standard
that...
that
i
believe
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
applied,
which
is
that...
that...
that
we
need
only
establish
to
show
antitrust
injury
a
price
below
the
market
level.
we
don't
need
to
prove
monopolization,
and
we
don't
need
to
prove
predation.
and
a
below
cost
sense
is
all
that
ought
to
be
required.
