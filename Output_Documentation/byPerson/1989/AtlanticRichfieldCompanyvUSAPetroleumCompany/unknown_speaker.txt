unknown
speaker
well,
as
it...
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
is
it
conceded
or
clear
that
usa
was
injured
and
was
injured
by
the
agreement
on
maximum
prices?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--that...
that
is...
well,
then,
maximum
price
fixing
by
agreement.
unknown
speaker
well,
the...
the
nonowned
stations,
there
was
an
agreement,
wasn't
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
that's
tantamount
to
an...
i
mean
it
should
be
treated
the
same
as
an
agreement?
unknown
speaker
yes.
all
right,
then.
unknown
speaker
so
there
was
a
section
1
violation?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
redcay,
how...
how
do
you
think
the
albrecht
decision
bears
on
this
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
if
you
have
to
look
for
a...
an
antitrust
injury,
as
you
claim,
that
you
are
somehow
altering
the
per
se
rule
under
albrecht,
whether
you
say
so
or
not.
unknown
speaker
so
you
wouldn't
be
here,
i
take
it,
if
the
dealer
was
suing?
unknown
speaker
you'd
have
to
get
albrecht
overruled
or
some...
and
some
others.
unknown
speaker
mr.
redcay,
reference
is
made
to
albrecht.
do
you
think
that
case
was
correctly
decided?
don't
be
afraid.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
justice
white
won't
mind.
go
ahead.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
see,
i
was
on
the
eighth
circuit
when
albrecht
was
reversed,
but
i
didn't
sit
on
the
panel.
unknown
speaker
xxx
if
we
don't
overrule
albrecht?
unknown
speaker
if
arco
could
have
predicted
that
consequence,
and
that
apparently
is
the
consequence
that
occurred,
does
that
mean
that
it
was
entitled
as
a
matter,
say,
of
business
judgment
and
legal
ethics
to
enter
into
the
agreements
that
it
did?
unknown
speaker
assume...
assume
a
price-fixing
agreement.
unknown
speaker
and
i
assume
their
attorneys
could
not
participate
in...
ethically
in
drawing
the
agreements?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's...
let's
assume
they
were
in
agreement.
unknown
speaker
but
as
i
understand
the
law,
sitting
in
the
corporate
board
room,
arco
should
not
have
engaged
in
this
conduct
if,
in
fact,
it
constituted
an
agreement
to
fix
maximum...
maximum
prices.
unknown
speaker
xxx
if,
as
justice
kennedy
suggests,
if
arco
had
just
said
would
you
like
to
be
a
dealer;
yeah;
well,
here,
sign
up,
and
here's
an
agreement
that
expressly
says
don't
sell
for
any
higher
price.
there
were
express
price-fixing
agreements,
you...
then
you
would
be
arguing
the
same
thing,
i
suppose?
unknown
speaker
mr.
redcay--
--but...
but
there's
a
lot
of
things
you
can
do
alone
but
not
by
agreement.
unknown
speaker
mr.
redcay,
it
seems
to
me
you
may...
you
may
be
understating
the
effect
of
our
agreeing
with
your
argument.
you
say
that's
no
doubt
that
the
coerced
dealers
would...
would
have
a
cause
of
action.
you
say
that
coercion
of
the
dealers
is
the
evil
at
which
the
antitrust
law
is
directed.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that's
true
at
all.
you're...
you're
relying
on
the
language
of...
of
brunswick
that
says
that
loss
must
be
the
type
that
the
antitrust
laws
were
intended
to
prevent
and
that
flows
from
that
which
makes
the
defendant's
acts
unlawful.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
minimum
price
fixing...
or
maximum
price
fixing
is
unlawful,
the
loss
it's
intended
to
prevent
is...
is
obtaining
control
of
the
market
and
therefore
being...
thereafter
being
able
to
raise
the
prices.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
antitrust
law
is
addressed
against
the
coercion
of
retailers.
who
cares
if
retailers
are
coerced?
unknown
speaker
i...
i
think
the
logic
of
your
theory
might
have
to
lead
us
to
say
that
there
is
no
cause
of
action
on
the
part
of
anybody
except
a
consumer
who
is
ultimately
harmed
by
the
market
monopolization
that
this
maximum
price
fixing
produces.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
redcay.
mr.
roberts.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's...
may
i
ask
right
there
the
same...
really
the
same
question
justice
scalia
asked,
i
suppose.
but
if
the
ultimate
test
is
whether
there
is
adverse
effect
on
competition
within
the
market
as
a
whole,
how
would
a
dealer
have
standing
to
make
the
argument?
couldn't...
couldn't
you...
couldn't
arco
defend
on
the
same
ground,
well,
the
market
as
a
whole
is
much
more
competitive
this
way,
it's
too
bad
that
you're
hurt?
unknown
speaker
but
that
may
be
so,
but
do
you
think
there
is
antitrust
injury
in
the
sense
the
term
is
used
in
brunswick
and
other
cases
if
the
suit
had
been
brought
by
a
dealer?
would
there
be
antitrust
injury?
unknown
speaker
in
reality,
though,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
definition
of
a...
of
the
violation,
not
a
definition...
not
a
description
of
the
injury.
that's
just
like
saying
that
the...
the
evil
in
minimum
price
fixing
is
prescribing
a
minimum
price.
that's
not
the
evil.
that's
the
violation.
the
evil
is
harming
consumer
welfare.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
the
evil
or
the
violation
is
coercing
the
dealers,
and
the
evil
is
how
that
disrupts
the
market.
unknown
speaker
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
an
agreement.
you
could
say
there's
nothing
wrong
with
everybody
charging
a
price.
the
evil
is
the
agreement,
not
the
harm
that
it
causes
to
anybody
but
the
agreement
in
a...
in
a
run
of
the
mine
sherman
act
violation.
the
agreement
is
what
makes
that
invalid.
coercion
is
what
makes
this
invalid.
but
neither
agreement
nor
coercion
is
the
evil
against
which
the
law
is
directed,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
xxx
is
agreed.
is
that
where
your
logic
would
lead?
unknown
speaker
is
it
the
government's
position
that
these
kind
of
agreements
are
beneficial
for
the
economy?
unknown
speaker
mr.
roberts,
would--
--[inaudible]
would
make
the
same
argument
is
there
was
horizontal
agreement
to...
among
two
competitors
of...
arco's...
one
of
arco's
competitors?
unknown
speaker
that...
and
that
they
agreed
that...
with
each
other
that
they
would
have
their
dealers
charge
no
more
than
a
certain
price?
unknown
speaker
and
the
result
was
that,
same
here.
they
were...
the
prices
were
lowered,
and
usa
got
hurt.
so
it's
irrelevant
to
you
that
these
maximum
prices
were
set
by
agreement,
either
vertically
or
horizontally?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
couldn't
the
dealers
sue
in
those
cases,
too?
unknown
speaker
right.
may
i
ask
you
this?
what
if
the...
what
if
arco
had
50
percent
of
the
market
instead
of
15
percent?
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
unknown
speaker
i'm
curious
to
know.
i
understand
it.
assuming
no
predatory
price,
i'm
just
curious
to
know
what
the
government's
position
would
be
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
70
percent
of
the
market?
unknown
speaker
you'd
say
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
blecher,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but
you
ultimately
withdrew
your
claim
of
predatory
pricing,
did
you
not?
unknown
speaker
let
me
call
your
attention
to
page
25a
of
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
which...
and
which
is
the
beginning
of
part
iv
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion.
in
the
second
sentence
there
it
says,
"we
are
asked
to
determine
whether
a
retail
competitor
suffers
antitrust
injury
in
the
form
of
lost
profits
as
a
result
of
a
nonpredatory
maximum
vertical
price-fixing
agreement."
i
would
think
the
ninth
circuit
certainly
understood
that
you
have
predatory
pricing
[inaudible].
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
not
judge
gray's
opinion.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
certainly
say
they're
considering
it
on
the
assumption
that
the
pricing
is
non-predatory.
they
say
that
in
so
many
words.
and
they
found
for
you
even
though...
even
though
they
assumed
or
held
or...
thought
that
predatory
pricing
was
[inaudible].
unknown
speaker
but
you
aren't
defending
the
ninth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
[inaudible]
unknown
speaker
[inaudible]
unknown
speaker
are
you
still
saying
[inaudible]?
unknown
speaker
wait.
they...
they
say
you
have
to
prove
it.
they
don't
say
that
anybody
has
to
prove
it
in
order
to
establish
a
violation
of
section
1.
their
point
is
in
order
for
your
client
to
sue,
that's
what
needs
to
be
proven.
unknown
speaker
they
are
not
saying
that
there's
no
violation
of
section
1.
they're
saying
there
may
well
be
a
violation
of
section
1
but
you
have
no
standing
to
complain
about
it.
unknown
speaker
it's
only
thus
converted
when
your
client
sues.
they
assert
that
had
the...
had
the
coerced
dealers
sued,
they
could
have...
they
could
have
recovered
under
section
1.
unknown
speaker
what
sort
of
resale
price...
you
think
resale
price
maintenance
is
minimum
fixing
as
well
as
maximum
fixing?
unknown
speaker
[inaudible]
unknown
speaker
xxx
u.s.
position?
unknown
speaker
mr.
blecher,
once
again,
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
they...
they
assert
that
that
kind
of
price
fixing
is
good.
they...
i
think
their
argument
would
assert
that
it
is
still
bad,
or
at
least
until
we
overrule
prior
case
law.
however,
it
is
not
the
kind
of
badness
that
your
client
can
complain
about,
other
people
can
complaint
about--
unknown
speaker
--aren't
low
prices
generally
thought
to
be
good
for
the
consumer?
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
but...
but
you...
you're
claiming
damages
because
you
lost
sales
from
somebody
who
was
selling
lower
than
you
were.
unknown
speaker
well...
well,
one
can
accept
that
what
they
did
with
their
dealers
was
illegal
and
still
not
feel
that
your
client
should
be
able
to
sue
for
it
when
the
result
was
to
lower
prices.
unknown
speaker
the
dealer--
unknown
speaker
--a
dealer
sued
in
albrecht.
unknown
speaker
xxx
absent...
absent
the
agreement
that
dealers
would
have...
would
have
acted
differently?
unknown
speaker
they
would
have
priced
their
product
differently?
unknown
speaker
and
you--
unknown
speaker
--think
you
would
have
been
hurt
because
of
the
way
you
were.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
arguing
for
a
prophylactic
rule?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if...
if
texaco
were
completely
and
vertically
integrated,
it
could
have
done
this,
i
take
it,
if
it
owned...
if
it
owned
a
retail--
unknown
speaker
--what
wouldn't
be
a
section
1?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
wouldn't
be
section
1.
unknown
speaker
they
could
have...
if
they
were
totally
integrated,
they
could
have
charged
these
very
same
prices
that
were...
that
this
conspiracy,
as
you
call
it,
resulted
in
without
violating
section
1.
unknown
speaker
but
we
wouldn't
be
talking
about
a
violation
of
section
2
with
only
15
percent
of
the
market.
unknown
speaker
only...
only
for
you,
mr.
blecher.
not
for
everybody.
[laughter]
it's...
it's
just
not--
unknown
speaker
--but
it's
not
fair
to
describe
our
cases,
is
it,
as
you
did
earlier,
to
say
who
cares,
you
know,
who
sues,
there's
been
a
section
1
violation?
i
mean,
as
brunswick
indicates,
we
do
care
who
sues.
it's
not
an
"any
stick
to
beat
a
dog."
approach
in
the
antitrust
laws.
unknown
speaker
it
has
to
be
someone
who's
been
injured
by
the
kind
of
evil
that
the
law...
was
meant
to...
to
affect.
unknown
speaker
have
you
given
us
your
fourth--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
interrupt
there,
mr.
blecher,
because
this
is,
it
seems
to
me,
a
little
different
twist
on
the
case.
i
thought
the
ninth
circuit
assumed
the
agreement
was
simply
an
agreement
to
fix
maximum
prices.
you
are
now
describing
the
agreement
as
an
agreement
to
drive
your
client
out
of
business.
unknown
speaker
did
the
ninth
circuit
rely
on
that
fact?
i
mean,
it's
quite
clear.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
very
different
case.
if
they
have
a
marketwide
policy
of
saying
the
dealer
can't
charge
more
than
so
many
cents
a
gallon,
that's
one
case.
it's
another
case
if
the
policy
is
wherever
your
stations
are
next
door
to...
to
usa's
stations
you
cut
the
price--
unknown
speaker
--and
therefore
in
order
to
drive
them
out
of
business.
you
think
it's
the
latter
case?
unknown
speaker
it's
quite
different
to
say
they're
being
driven
out
of
the
market
as
a
result
of
a
marketwide
program
on
the
one
hand
and
being
driven
out
of
the
market
as
a
result
of
a
program
specifically
intended
to
drive
the
particular
competitor
out
of
business.
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
that
when
the
district
court
found,
as
i
think
it
did,
at
least
according
to
the
court
of
appeals,
that
there
was
no
predatory
pricing,
the
prices
were
not
predatory,
that
would
not
cover
pricing
directed
at
particular
competitors?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understand,
but--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
your...
is
it
your
theory
of
the
case
that
there
was
a
not
a
marketwide
program
here
but
one
that
only
operated
in
the
areas
in
which
there
were
independent
competitors?
unknown
speaker
and
so
there
would
be
a
defense
if
they
could
prove...
in
your
view,
then,
it
would
be
a
defense
if
they
could
prove
that
the
same
program
was
followed
even
in
the
segments
of
the
market
where
there
was
no
independent
competition?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
would
be
pretty
hard
to
say
it's
selective
conduct
if
it
wasn't
selective.
unknown
speaker
but
your
theory
is...
is
that
it
was
selective.
unknown
speaker
not
merely
that
it
was
[inaudible].
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
if
you're
right,
mr.
blecher,
why
did
the
court
of
appeals,
do
you
think,
discuss
at
such
length
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
in
the
jack
walters
&
sons
v.
morton
building,
and
say
they
disagreed
with
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you
would
think
that
if
the
ninth
circuit
saw
your
case
as
you
saw
it,
they
would
have
said,
you
know,
what
the
seventh
circuit
said
doesn't
apply
here
because
it
was
a
conspiracy
to
drive
plaintiffs
out
of
business.
unknown
speaker
what
anticompetitive...
under
rule
of
reason,
what
anticompetitive
effect
would
you
prove?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
the
ultimate
effect
of...
of
the
action?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
answer?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the...
the
elimination
of
sellers
who
were
charging
higher
prices
is
an
anticompetitive
effect?
unknown
speaker
when
there
is
no...
when
there
is
no
monopolization
or
attempt
to
monopolize,
just
the
elimination
of...
of...
of
people
who
were
charging
more?
i
thought
that
happens
every
day.
i
thought
that's
good
competition.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you're
assuming
no
per
se.
we're
in
a
non-per
se
environment
now,
so
that
the--
--but
there
would
still
be
a
combination?
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
saying
is
i
don't
see
how
it
can
unless
you
have
the
material
for
a
section
2
case.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
what
the...
what
your
view...
what
do
the
undisputed
facts
show
with
respect
to
the
impact
of
this
program
on
your
client?
what...
what
change
in
its
market
share--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
unknown
speaker
did...
do
you
allege
how...
how
significant
the
impact
was
on
your
business?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
didn't
go
down
from
6
percent
to
2
percent?
unknown
speaker
if
it's...
if
it's
so
easy
to
do
all
that
and
it's
such
an
obvious
consequence,
you
would
think
that
they'd
