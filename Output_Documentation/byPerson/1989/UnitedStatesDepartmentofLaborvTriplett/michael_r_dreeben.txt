mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
is
whether
the
system
for
awarding
attorney's
fees
in
the
federal
black
lung
program
violates
the
due
process
clause
by
denying
claimants
access
to
counsel.
we
believe
that
the
holding
below,
that
the
fee
system
is
unconstitutional,
is
wrong
for
two
basic
reasons.
first,
there
is
no
adequate
showing
that
meritorious
black
lung
claims
are
being
lost
because
of
the
attorney's
fee
system;
or
even
that
attorneys
are
unavailable
for
vast
numbers
of
claimants.
second,
evaluated
under
the
mathews
v.
eldridge
test,
the
black
lung
system
does
not
deny
claimants
fundamental
fairness.
the
black
lung
program
is
a
unique
federal
effort
to
pay
disability
benefits
to
eligible
coal
miners
and
their
survivors.
under
the
program,
hundreds
of
thousands
of
miners
have
been
paid
benefits.
the
fee
regulations
are
designed
to
protect
claimants
by
ensuring
that
no
claimant
must
bear
his
own
attorney's
fees
in
a
contested
case.
they
also
provide
that
no
fee
will
be
charged
if
the
applicant
does
not
succeed
in
obtaining
benefits.
these
provisions
serve
the
goals
of
maximizing
the
use
of
funds
for
the
benefit
of
claimants,
and
relieving
claimants
of
the
responsibility
of
paying
fees,
win
or
lose.
any
system
of
fee
regulation
will
discourage
some
attorneys
from
participating.
but
in
the
context
of
this
disability
program,
in
which
fee
regulation
is
designed
to
protect
claimants,
and
where
changes
to
the
fee
system
will
impair
other
important
government
interests,
we
believe
the
congress
and
the
department
of
labor
must
have
considerable
flexibility
to
structure
appropriate
procedures.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
this
is
a
state
attorney
disciplinary
proceeding,
in
which
the
respondent
collected
fees
that
were
not
approved
by
the
department
of
labor.
and
the
west
virginia
committee
on
legal
ethics
commenced
a
disciplinary
proceeding
based
on
the
violation
of--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
decision
binds
the
department
of
labor,
except
as
to
respondent.
it
does
have
the
effect
of
res
judicata
as
to
mr.
triplett.
and
in
that
sense
the
united
states
is
bound.
but
i
think
the
more
fundamental
interest
that
caused
us
to
bring
to
the
court
here
is
that
the
decision
below,
by
holding
that
the
fees
are
unconstitutional,
the
system
for
awarding
fees,
casts
a
cloud
over
the
legitimacy
of
the
program.
and
we
believe
that
the
department
of
labor
has
an
interest
in
establishing
that
its
program
is
operated
constitutionally
and
does
not
violate
any
due
process
interests.
we
are
also
concerned
that
this
decision
may
encourage
lawyers
in
west
virginia
and
in
other
states
to
violate
the
department
of
labor's
fee
regulations,
believing
that
they
can
do
that
with
impunity.
and
to
a
certain
extent,
that
may
be
true,
because
the
department
of
labor
does
not
have
an
established
mechanism
to
police
the
attorneys
who
practice
before
it
and
to
ensure
that
they
comply
with
the
fee
regulations.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
we
don't
think
the
government
has
a
standing
problem.
the
department
of
labor's
interest
here
is
in
establishing
that
its
fee
system
is
constitutional.
and
to
the
extent
that
it's
bound
against
respondent
by
virtue
of
having
participated
in
this
case
as
a
party,
it
clearly
has
the
standing
of
an
aggrieved
party
to
bring
the
case
here.
but
in
any
event,
there
is
another
petitioner
in
this
court,
the
committee
on
legal
ethics
has
filed
its
own
petition.
it
has
an
interest
in
continuing
to
enforce
its
disciplinary
rules
against
respondent.
and
the
sole
reason
given
by
the
court
below
for
not
enforcing
its
own
disciplinary
rules
was
its
belief
that
the
fee
system
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
court,
when
it
issued
its
initial
opinion,
invited
the
department
of
labor
to
intervene
in
the
proceeding
as
a
party,
either
to
seek
rehearing
or
to
file
a
petition
in
this
court.
and
the
department
of
labor
did
intervene.
it
had
a
limited
amount
of
time
to
supplement
the
record,
and
it
did
that.
and
it
filed
a
petition
for
a
rehearing,
which
was
denied.
and
subsequent
to
that
we
filed
a
petition
in
this
court,
as
did
the
committee
on
legal
ethics.
we
don't
actually
believe
the
court
need
to
reach
the
standing
question
as
to
the
government
in
this
case,
because
the
presence
of
the
committee
on
legal
ethics
as
a
petitioner
satisfies
any
possible
standing
concerns
from
[inaudible].
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
believed
that
it
wasn't
going
to
enforce
the
disciplinary
rules
here,
but
the
committee
on
legal
ethics
has
brought
a
petition
to
this
court,
and
it
does
continue
to
assert
an
interest
in
enforcing
the
disciplinary
rules
against
respondent.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
we
believe
that
we
have
independent
standing
as
well,
because--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--only
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
committee
on
legal
ethics
does
not
have
standing
so
that
the
case
is
not
properly
in
this
court,
unless
the
department
of
labor
does.
we
believe
that
either
of
those
grounds
would
furnish
an
adequate
basis
for
a
decision
in
this
court.
turning
to
the
constitutional
question--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
justice
stevens.
the
department
actually
doesn't
have
machinery
set
up
to
bring
its
own
enforcement
proceedings
against
lawyers.
it
really
does
rely
on
state
bar
organizations
like
the
committee
on
legal
ethics
to
enforce
its
regulations
through
the
enforcement
of
their
own
disciplinary--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
wouldn't
say
that
there
would
be
no
remedy.
there
would
be
possibly
a
criminal
remedy
if
there
were
fraud
involved.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there...
there
is
a
limited
amount
of
machinery
built
into
the
current
system
that
the
department
of
labor
might
be
able
to
draw
upon
to
discipline
attorneys
or
to
preclude
them
from
representing
claimants
in
the
future.
it
doesn't
have
a...
an
adequate
disciplinary
mechanism,
because
its
primary
function
is
really
to
adjudicate
black
lung
claims
and
to
pay
beneficiaries,
not
to
police
attorneys.
now
the
rules
are
there,
but
it's
been
the
long-standing
practice
of
the
department,
which
it's
found
satisfactory,
to
rely
on
state
committees
on
legal
ethics
to
enforce
unlawful
fee
arrangements.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
my
understanding,
justice
stevens.
i
don't
think
that
this
has
been
a
major
problem
in
the
sense
that
there
has
been
hundreds
of
cases
that
the
department
of
labor
becomes
aware
of
in
which
people
ignore
the
fee
regulations,
and
the
department
doesn't
do
anything.
i
think
cases
like
this
serve
a
deterrent
function,
and
most
attorneys
probably
are
not
going
to
deliberately
flout
rules
that
they
know
are
valid.
however,
there
has
been
something
of
a
problem
in
the
black
lung
area,
particularly
since
this
case,
because
some
attorneys
have
notified
the
department
that
they
believe
that
the
regulations
are
no
longer
valid
and
they
intend
to
charge
contingent
fees
and
to
collect
25
percent
of
back
benefits.
and
that
does
directly
infringe
upon
the
policy
that
supports
the
fee
regulations.
we
believe
that
the
attorney's
fee
system
is
constitutional
if
evaluated
under
the
mathews
v.
eldridge
test,
which
the
court
below
purported
to
apply
but
we
believe
applied
incorrectly.
i'd
like
to
note
at
the
outset
that
it's
notable
that
this
decision
rests
upon
an
extraordinarily
frail
factual
record.
there
is
very
little
in
the
record,
other...
to
talk
about
how
the
fee
system
actually
affects
the
incentives
of
attorneys,
other
than
the
affidavits
of
a
relatively
small
number
of
attorneys,
and
some
selective
citations
from
congressional
testimony.
we
do
not
believe
that
that
is
a
sufficient
record
to
support
a
finding
of
unconstitutionality
in
dealing
with
a
large-scale
benefits
program
like
the
one
at
issue
here.
now,
we
also
believe
that
it's
inappropriate
for
a
court
to
determine
on
such
a
small
record
that
the
department
has
not
acted
in
good
faith
to
develop
adequate
procedures.
but,
regardless
of
the
criticisms
of
the
record,
we
also
think
that
the
court
went
seriously
astray
in
applying
the
analysis
directed
under
mathews
v.
eldridge.
there
are
two
important
government
interests
that
are
served
by
the
fee
regulations.
the
first
is
that
benefits
go
for
the
benefit
of
a
qualified
claimant,
or
an
applicant's
survivor,
so
that
the
money
that
the
government
devotes
to
this
program
serves
for
the
support
of
coal
miners
and
their
survivors
and
doesn't,
in
effect,
turn
into
a
lawyers'
relief
act,
in
which
substantial
amounts
of
the
benefits
are
diverted
to
attorneys.
there
is
also
a
secondary
motive
underlying
the
fee
regulation
of
ensuring
that
claimants
do
not
make
improvident
agreements
with
attorneys.
and
for
that
reason
there
is
an
approval
requirement
even
when
claimants
do
bear
their
own
fees,
which
they
do
if
a
case
is
not
contested.
there
is
a
second
important
government
interest
that
i
believe
the
court
overlooked,
and
that
is
the
following.
once
congress
determined
to
protect
claimants
by
shifting
fees
to
the
losing
party,
the
responsible
operator
or
the
trust
fund,
the
government
has
a
substantial
interest
in
assuring
that
the
system
under
which
that
party
must
pay
the
fees
determines
the
fees
fairly.
in
other
words,
it's
not
appropriate
that
the
fees
would
be
paid
before
a
benefits
award
is
final,
because
in
that
event
the
attorneys
may
collect
the
money
that
subsequently
has
to
be
repaid,
and
this
could
prove
difficult
as
a
practical
matter.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
that's
actually
raised
that,
justice
stevens.
but
i
think
we
would
take
the
position
that
that
kind
of
consultation,
preliminary
to
a
benefits
application,
could
not
be
compensated
without
approval
from
the
appropriate
agency.
and
if
no
claim
were
actually
filed,
i
believe
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
attorney
legitimately
to
charge.
one
important
aspect--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
government
interest
that
justifies
that
prohibition
is
in
having
a
program
that
offers
to
claimants
and
their
survivors
the
opportunity
to
apply
without
having
any
risk
of
paying
attorney's
fees
at
all.
there
is
no
reason
why
a
claimant
who
is
not
going
to
receive
a
benefit
under
this
program
pay
attorney's
fees
in
order
to
find
that
out.
that
at
least,
i
believe,
is
the
theory
underlying
the
total
prohibition
of
any
attorney's
fees,
unless
the
claimant
actually
prevails.
and
so
for
that...
that
purpose
actually
helps
claimants,
because
they
can
go
to
an
appropriate
social
security
office
or
department
of
labor
office
and
receive
a
claims
information
form
that
tells
them
here
are
the
basic
criteria
in
the
program.
it
provides
that
you
will
have
an
attorney
and
you
won't
have
to
pay
if
you
prevail
and
it's
not
contested.
and
i
think
that
that's
a
substantial
government
interest
to
be
able
to
offer
in
a
disability
program
of
this
type
that
was
designed
to
reach
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people,
many
of
whom
may
have
no
idea
whether
they
actually
do
have
a
valid
claim,
but
might
be
willing
to
pay
two,
three,
four
or
$500
dollars
to
find
that
out,
and
would
thereby
just
lose
that
money.
i
was
saying
that
there
is
a
second
government
interest
in
this
program,
and
that
is
to
ensure
that
if
fees
are
to
be
borne
by
the
losing
party,
they
are
determined
fairly.
and
that
support
is
in
the
requirement
that
no
fees
are
paid
until
a
benefits
award
is
final.
it
also
supports
the
method
of
determining
fees
in
this
case,
which
does
not
permit
great
multipliers.
it
does
account,
i
would
like
to
stress,
for
both
the
delay
factor
and
the
risk
of
loss
factor
that
were
very
heavily
relied
on
by
the
court
below.
the
way
in
which
the
longshore
act
and
the
black
lung
benefits
act
account
for
these
two
factors
is
by
assuming
that
the
hourly
rate
of
attorneys
practicing
in
this
field
takes
those
matters
into
account.
attorneys
have
argued
in
various
papers
filed
with
the
government
that
these
methods
are
not
adequate
to
provide
sufficient
compensation.
but
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
is
the
statute
does
call
for
the
payment
of
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee.
the
department
of
labor
has
interpreted
that
to
include
a
risk
of
loss
component.
and
the
attorneys
who
are
dissatisfied
with
the
exact
way
in
which
that's
been
applied
can
continue
to
litigate
that,
and
can
attempt
to
obtain
a
larger
benefits
award...
or
a
larger
award
of
attorney's
fees
if
they
believe
it's
justified
by
the
statutory
criteria.
but
any
system
of
awarding
fees
that
is
in
a
sense
contingent,
which
is
this
one,
will
have
the
effect
of
forcing
attorneys
to
be
somewhat
selective
in
the
cases
that
they
take.
and
we
do
not
think
that
the...
the
way
in
which
the
department
of
labor
has
applied
this
program
has
denied
all
incentives
for
attorneys
to
take
on
cases
that,
after
evaluation,
appear
reasonably
meritorious.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
not
sure,
justice
stevens,
whether
it
would
or
wouldn't.
it
would...
the...
it
would
depend
upon
a
rather
particularized
analysis
of
exactly
what
is
at
stake
in
each
type
of
program.
what
makes
this
program
special
is
that
it
is
a
federal
disability
benefits
program
in
which
the
government
is
prepared
to
come
up
with
money
to
pay
people
who
satisfy
these
statutory
criteria.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
i
think
that
the...
the...
the
flexibility
that...
that
is
warranted
when
the...
when
the...
the
individual
interest
at
stake
is
a
disability
benefit,
is
somewhat
greater
than
in
some
of
the
other
areas
that...
that
could
be
identified,
perhaps
a
federal
torts
claims
act
suit,
or
a
constitutional
rights
suit.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
there
isn't,
justice
scalia.
but
the
analysis,
i
think,
would
be
the
same
as
it
is
in
this
case.
one
would
look
at
the
three
factors
identified
under
mathews
v.
eldridge
and
try
to
determine
whether
a
fundamentally
fair
proceeding
can
be
achieved
if--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the...
the
question
of
whether
applicants
have
a
protected
property
interest
under
the
due
process
clause
was
noted
in
the
opinion
below
and
it's
noted
in
our
brief.
but
we
don't
think
that
the
court
need
to
decide
in
this
case
any
more
than
it
needed
to
decide
it
in
the
walters
case.
there
is
at
least
one
beneficiary
in
this
case
who
is
actually
awarded
benefits,
and
a...
a
hearing
was
to
be
held
to
be
determine
whether
the
operator's
challenge
to
that
award
would
be
sustained
or
rejected.
and
in
that
context
we
think
that
under
this
court's
cases
there
is
a
protected
due...
property
interest
that
would
require
appropriate
procedures.
and
because
the
court
below--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
yes.
the...
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i...
i
think
that
there
is
a
liberty
interest
that
could
be
asserted
in
that
context,
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
lends
any
additional
weight
to
the
kind
of
claim
that's
being
pressed
in
this
case
on
behalf
of
black
lung
claimants.
it
might
have
a
different
significance
in
some
other
context.
but
here
the
primary
aim
is
to
obtain
benefits
the
congress
provided
under
an
entitlement
program
to
make
up
for
the
fact
that
states
were
not
really
adequately
affording
benefits
for
this
particular
occupational
disease.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i...
i
think
that's
essentially
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
i
think
that
that
actually
makes
some
sense
in
this...
in
this
program.
the...
the
typical
beneficiary
is
not
someone
who
has
a
vast
amount
of
resources.
it's
probably
also
not
the
kind
of
person
who
is
terribly
sophisticated
in
legal
matters.
and
congress
can
take
into
consideration
in
that
particular
type
of
situation
that
there
is
a
danger
of
exploitation.
and
it
want...
if
it
wants
to
avoid
that
danger
of
exploitation
it
sets
up
a
fee
system
in
which
the
beneficiary
doesn't
pay
fees
at
the
outset.
the
program
is,
in
essence,
contingent,
and
the
lawyer
does
have
to
undertake
the
initial
analysis
of
the
case
without
the
benefit
of
being
paid.
but
that
is
not
very
unusual
in
a
personal
injury
context.
in
fact
i
would
suggest
that
it's
the
norm
in
any
area
that's
a
contingent
area.
the
lawyer
evaluates
the
case
up
front
to
try
to
decide
whether
there
is
a
sufficient
amount
of
merit
to
the
case
to
make
it
reasonable
for
him
to
go
forward,
or
for
her
to
go
forward.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i...
i
don't
think
so,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
the
statute
there
was
quite
explicit,
that...
that
there
was
a
$10
cap
on
fees
in
any
context.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
i
think
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
this
program
should
be
dealt
with
in
the
same
sense.
that
is,
that
the
attorney's
fees
regulations
apply
to
preliminary
consultations
just
as
much
as
to
pressing
the
actual
benefits
claim.
otherwise
they
would
really
fail
over
their
fundamental
purpose
of
making
sure
that
the
claimants
had
the
opportunity
to
participate
in
this
program
without
the
risk
that
they
would
lose
money
if
their
claim
did
not
succeed
by
virtue
of
having
to
pay
an
attorney.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
our...
i
would
like
to
say
at
the
outset,
of
course,
that
we
don't
think
that's
been
shown
in
this
case.
but
if
there
were
some
showing
that
the
fee
system
actually
was
preventing
people
from
getting
counsel,
we
still
think
that
this
program
would
be
constitutional
as
applied.
the
reason
is
that
the
department
of
labor
has
taken
some
significant
steps
to
ensure
that
even
if
a
claimant
does
not
have
counsel
he
has
a
fair
opportunity
to
press
his
benefits
claim.
and
we
do
not
think
that
the
risk
of
a
loss
without
an
attorney
is
so
significant
in
the
context
of
this
program
that
the
fee
system
should
be
invalidated
and
the
government
interests
supported
be
denied
in
order
to
allow
some
people
to
get
lawyers.
the
program
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--your
assumption,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
people
would
not
pursue
the
claim--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--pro
se
at
all?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
again,
i
would
note
that
there
isn't
a
showing
of
that's
happening.
that
would
be
a
different
case
and
perhaps
a
harder
case,
because
it
might
suggest
that
in
some
sense
the
program
is
so
inhospitable
to
pro
se
claimants
that
they
refuse
to
participate.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i'm
not
really
sure
what
constitutional
provision
would
be
involved.
the
first
question
would
be
whether
the
court
was
prepared
to
say
that
someone
who
has
a...
someone
who
was
an
applicant
has
a
protected
property
interest.
we
would
dispute
that,
and
if
that
contention
prevailed
then
there
would
be
no
constitutional
issue,
other
than
either
a
first
amendment
or
some
sort
of
a
liberty
issue
in
consulting
counsel,
and
it's
not
clear
to
me
that
either
of
those
interests
would
be
sufficient
to
determine
that
this
program
is
unconstitutional.
this
is,
after
all,
a
program
in
which
congress
is
attempting
to
supplement
financial
benefits
for
a
certain
category
of
workers,
and
it
sets
up
a
program
which
it
believes
is
fair.
and
unless
there's
a
showing
that
it's
fundamentally
unfair
to
people
who
proceed
pro
se,
the
decision
of
some
individuals
not
to
proceed
pro
se
probably
would
not
be
a
ground
[inaudible].
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
provide
counsel.
this
isn't
a
case
like
gideon
v.
wainwright,
or
lassiter
v.
department
of
social
services.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
but
in
walters,
the
court
noted
that
the
program
at
issue
in
goldberg
didn't
have
a
policy
against
prohibiting
the
welfare
applicant
from
dividing
his
check
with
the
lawyer,
and
that
policy
is
very
clearly
present
here,
just
as
it
was
present
in
walters,
and
thus
there
has
to
be
some
sort
of
a
weighing
process
to
determine
whether
the
program
becomes
fundamentally
unfair
if
somebody
does
not
have
free
and
unrestrained
access
to
lawyers.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
there
would
be
constitutional
authority
to
prohibit
counsel,
provided
that
the
procedure
itself
is
designed
to
operate
without
lawyers,
which
was
the
case
in
the
walters
decision.
it
really
is
not
the
case
here
to
the
extent
that
the
department
of
labor
actually
wants
lawyers
out
of
the
system.
it
doesn't
want
lawyers
out
of
the
system.
what
it
does
is
provide
what
it
believes
is
fair
compensation
for
lawyers,
and
it
provides
a
procedure
where,
if
somebody
does
not
proceed
with
a
lawyer,
they
still
have
a
fair
chance
to
establish
their
claim.
and
it
balances
various
factors.
it
tries
to
ensure
that
government
money
is
essentially
applied
to
the
benefit
of
beneficiaries,
it
tries
to
ensure
that
claimants
don't
squander
their
fees
consulting
attorneys
when
they
don't
have
a
valid
claim.
and
we
think
that
congress
really
needs
to
have
a
considerable
amount
of
latitude
to
structure
these
types
of
programs
within
the
general
bounds
of
fairness.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
would
be
a
much
harder
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
would
really
depend
on
whether
in
analyzing
the
specific
procedures
that
claimants
without
counsel
could
get
a
fair
hearing.
i
think
it's
possible.
i
think
the
closer
that
you
move
to
a
pure
adjudicatory
model
and
you
unbalance
the
scales
by
allowing
one
side
to
have
lawyers
and
the
other
side
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
government
does
pay
a
substantial
number
of
awards.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes,
it
is.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
as
to
that
category,
of
course,
the
government
isn't
paying
but
it
still
does
provide
a
variety
of
protections
for
claimants.
the
initial
stage
of
the
process
is
not
adversarial.
it's
a
claims
examiner
which
helps.
then
the
alj
proceeding
is
really
not
like
a
proceeding
in
court.
obviously,
evidentiary
rules
don't
apply,
and
the
aljs
do
take
some
steps
to
assist
the
pro
se
claimants.
and
finally,
the
benefits
review
board
reviews
with
particular
care
any
case
brought
up
by
a
pro
se
claimant.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
a
certain
category
of
cases
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
that
is
sufficient
in
this
case.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
low
approval
rate
in
the
program
as
it's
currently
structured
is
not
an
accident.
congress
was
aware
when
it
tightened
the
eligibility
criteria
in
1981
that
there
would,
indeed,
be
a
low
approval
rate,
and
there
is
no
showing
in
this
record
or
anywhere
else
that
i'm
aware
of
that
that
low
approval
rate
flows
from
the
presence
or
absence
of
counsel
in
a
particular
case.
the
respondent
has
relied
quite
heavily
on
the
affidavit
of
ms.
denney.
i
would
only
suggest
that
affidavit
indicates
that
there
is
a
higher
rate
of
representation
than
respondent
would
have
one
believe,
and
the
burden
in
this
case
was
not
on
the
department
of
labor
to
establish
the
constitutionality
of
its
program.
the
burden
was
on
whoever
challenged
it
to
establish
that
it
was
not
constitutional.
and,
finally,
the
regulation
that
governs
fees,
we
believe,
is
consistent
with
the
statute
and
can
be
applied
consistently
to
provide
a
sufficient
incentive
for
lawyers
to
come
into
the
system.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
the
agency
construes
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
to
include
a
component
for
risk
of
loss
and
for
delay.
there's
going
to
be
some
fighting
about
how
you
determine
those
two
factors,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
department
would
agree
with
some
of
the
proposals
that
have
been
made
to
it
to
give
a
multiplier
of
two,
three,
four,
five
or
six
because
of
the
contingency
factor.
in
any
area
where
there's
a
contingency
factor
lawyers
are
going
to
be
selective,
but
i
think
that's
a
good
thing,
not
a
bad
thing,
and
the
regulation
is
adequate
to
provide
a
sufficient
fee,
we
believe.
and
if
the
lawyers
disagree,
they
can
litigate
that
issue.
thank
you.
