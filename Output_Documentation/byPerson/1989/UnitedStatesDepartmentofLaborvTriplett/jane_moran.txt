ms.
jane
moran
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
a
very
interesting
thing
happened
in
this
case
when
it
was
in
front
of
the
west
virginia
supreme
court.
as
you've
been
told,
the
department
was
given
the
opportunity
to
petition
for
a
rehearing,
which
they
did,
and
they
filed
a
motion
asking
to
be
allowed
to
supplement
the
record,
which
was
granted.
now,
one
would
assume
that
the
department
at
this
point
would
put
together
the
very
strongest
evidence
that
they
had
to
convince
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
that
their
findings
were
incorrect.
included
in
the
evidence
that
they
presented
was
an
affidavit
by
their
own
chief
administrative
law
judge,
nahum
litt,
and
that
affidavit
is
interesting
both
because
of
its
brevity
and
because
of
the
limits
of
its
scope.
it
does
not
challenge
the
findings
of
the
court
that
too
many
pro
se
claimants
are
being
forced
to
proceed
without
counsel.
it
does
not
challenge
the
assertions
in
the
briefs
below
that
only
12
attorneys
in
the
entire
state
of
west
virginia
will
take
these
cases
on
a
regular
basis.
in
fact,
he
goes
into
some
detail
explaining
the
very
unusual
efforts
that
are
being
made
by
his
administrative
law
judges
to
help
people
to
find
the
counsel
that
will
take
these
cases.
the
reason
for
this
can
be
found
in
his
testimony
before
the
congressional
subcommittee
on
government
operations
in
june
of
1985.
judge
litt
was
asked
at
that
time
what
could
be
done
about
all
these
attorneys
complaints
about
delays,
meaning
delays
in
processing
of
claims,
delays
in
processing
fee
petitions.
judge
litt
responded,
and
i
quote,
"i
have
not
addressed
what
other
avenues
might
be
explored
that
would
change
that
and
provide
for
better
representation."
"one
of
the
fears
i
certainly
intend
to
stress
is
if
you
go
to
a
larger
and
larger
number
of
cases
being
tried
in
a
given
year
with
a
finite
number
of
attorneys
who
are
willing
to
take
these
cases,
that
we
will
end
up
with
more
and
more
claimants
being
pro
se,
and
being
poorly
represented
in
an
ever-increasing
complex
area
of
law."
this
was
in
june
of
1985,
and
the
department
of
labor
now
tells
the
court
that
they
have
never
kept
any
statistics
that
would
tell
them
how
often
people
are
represented
in
front
of
the
administrative
law
judges.
ms.
jane
moran
these
figures
that
i'm
giving
you
statistics.
but
even
if
we
could,
can't
congress
make
the
judgment
that
even
though
a
large
number
of
people
might
not
be
able
to
get
counsel,
in
our
judgment
it's
worth
it
to
enable
more
funds
to
be
dispensed
to
those
who
are
seriously
enough
harmed
that
they
have
enough
incentive
on
their
own,
without
having
to
get
counsel,
to
go...
to
go
and
make
claims?
why
would
that
be
an
unreasonable
judgment?
it
all
comes
out
of
the
same
pot.
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
first
of
all
i
don't
think
congress
has
made
that
judgment.
i
don't
think
it's
that
clear.
i
think
congress
has
indicated
some
very
serious
concern
about
this,
and
they
continue
to
have
hearings
on
the
question
of
attorney's
fees
and
the
sufficiency
of
attorney's
fees
and
the
availability
of
counsel.
ms.
jane
moran
well,
your
honor,
i
mean
no
disrespect
when
i
say
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
figure
out
why
congress
does
much
of
what
they
do,
and
it's
now,
your
honor?
ms.
jane
moran
these
are
in
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
by
the
department
of
labor
to
the
west
virginia
supreme
court.
ms.
jane
moran
they
made
findings
of
fact,
your
honor,
based
on
the
affidavits
of
the
attorneys
which
were
submitted
to
the
court,
the
testimony
that
had
been
given
in
the
ethics
hearing,
two
congressional
hearings
in
which...
i
believe
there
was
eight
attorneys
testified.
judge
litt
testified.
ms.
jane
moran
no,
as
it's
applied,
your
honor.
ms.
jane
moran
as
it's
applied
in
this
case
and
generally
in
west
virginia,
that
the
fee
structure--
ms.
jane
moran
--no,
they
did
not.
ms.
jane
moran
it
arises
out
of
mr.
triplett's
failure
to
comply
with
the
department
of
labor
regulation,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jane
moran
well,
the
regulation
does
not
set
the
fee,
no.
there
is
no--
ms.
jane
moran
--standard
fee.
that
is
determined...
when
an
attorney
applies
for
fees,
he
must...
he
must--
ms.
jane
moran
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
ms.
jane
moran
the
regulation.
ms.
jane
moran
yes,
and
that's
why
i
argue,
your
honor,
that
the--
ms.
jane
moran
--i
argue...
yes,
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
intent
of
the
black
lung
law.
ms.
jane
moran
i
say
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
intent
of
the
law,
and
that
the
effect
of
it
is
to
prevent
people
with
good
claims
from
getting
an
attorney.
ms.
jane
moran
let
me
say,
your
honor,
one
of
the
positions
that
the
department
of
labor
has
taken
is
that
we
are
holding
out
for
straight
contingency
fees
with
no
regulation.
that
is
not
our
position.
it
has
never
been
our
position.
we
think
that
regulation
is
appropriate.
we
have...
the
first
thing
that
i
am
asking
this
court
today
is
to
support
the
west
virginia
court
in
their...
in
their
finding
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
it
is
applied.
however,
we
have
other
suggestions
that
we
would
make.
ms.
jane
moran
i
think...
i
must
say
it
is
not
supported
by
the
statute,
because
i
think
it's
effect
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute
and
with
the
intents
of
the
statute.
ms.
jane
moran
well,
your
honor,
i
have...
i
would
say
in
response
to
that,
that
we
now
have
in
excess
of
a
96
percent
denial
rate
on
initial
application,
and
after
three
levels
of
appeal
we
only
add
1
percent
to
that.
i
think
that
we
have
to
ask
whether
congress
put
this
whole
system
together
for
4
percent
of
the
people
who
are
applying
for
benefits
to
be
able
to
qualify,
and
that
one
of
the
problems
is,
these
cases
come
down
again
and
again.
ms.
jane
moran
no,
your
honor,
i'm
saying--
ms.
jane
moran
--i'm
saying
that
they're
denied.
that
there
are
more
than
96
percent
of
the
cases
denied
at
the
initial
level.
ms.
jane
moran
that's
correct.
ms.
jane
moran
there
is
only
1
percent
added
to
that.
there
is
an
overall
denial
rate
of
5
percent...
of
95
percent.
ms.
jane
moran
no,
your
honor.
that...
i
was
trying
to
break
down
this
figure--
ms.
jane
moran
--i
don't
have
that
figure,
your
honor.
the
only
people
who
have
those
figures
are
the
department
of
labor,
and
the
only
figures
that
we
have
available
are
the
findings
of
miss
denney,
and
what
miss
denney's
figures
come
down
to
is
that
she
looked
at
800...
well,
if
i
may
go
back.
she
found
that
77.1
percent
in
over
a
year
after
being
filed
with
the
administrative
law
judges
have
gone
nowhere,
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
figure
of
representation
on
that
77.1
percent
would
be
the
most
informative
figure
for
this
court.
ms.
jane
moran
your
honor,
they
are
not
reasonable
for
the
amount
of
work
that
is
entailed,
for
the
level
of
expertise
that
is
involved
and
for
the
delay
in
receiving
fees.
ms.
jane
moran
but,
your
honor,
what...
how
do
we
determine
the
fee
for
the
affidavit
before
the
supreme
court
saying...
from
the
attorney
saying
that
he
has
been
owed
$30,000
in
fees
for
upwards
to
ten
years,
for
close
to
ten
years?
ms.
jane
moran
well,
your
honor,
i
believe,
based
on
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court
that
when
we
find
that,
whether
it's
the
fee
or
whether
it's
the
handling,
the
processing
of
the
fee,
if
generally
the
effect
of
this
is
to
be
inadequate,
then
the
regulation
is
improper.
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
intent
of
getting
these
benefits
to
worthy
recipients.
ms.
jane
moran
if
i
may,
your
honor,
the
other
problem
along
with
the
actual
dollar
amount
of
the
fee
are
the
inordinate
delays
in
waiting
for
them,
the
fact
that
the
attorney
who
tells
us
he's
owed
$30,000
in
fees
is
not
going
to
receive
one
cent
of
interest
on
those
fees.
there
is
a
procedure
that
requires
the
attorney
to
submit
a
petition
at
each
level.
at
first
at
the
deputy
commissioner,
at
the
alj,
the
benefit
review
board...
each
one
of
those
persons
who
determine
that
fee
may
come
up
with
a
different
level.
therefore,
it
is
impossible
to
predict
what
fee
is
going
to
be
paid.
ms.
jane
moran
well,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
agency
and
to
this
court,
i
don't
that
the
department
of
labor
administrative
law
judges
or
the
deputy
commissioners
are
going
to
provide
for
fees
for
the
lack
of
interest.
they
are
going
to
take
the
position
that
nobody
is
telling
them
that
they
have
to
pay
interest.
ms.
jane
moran
well--
ms.
jane
moran
--your
honor,
i
have
taken
them
to
court
in
the
vehicle
that
i
had
to
work
with.
ms.
jane
moran
you're
talking
about
my
client
now,
your
honor?
ms.
jane
moran
in
fact,
my
client
has
returned
every
cent
of
fees
that
he
received.
ms.
jane
moran
that's
correct,
until...
until--
ms.
jane
moran
--well,
i...
i
think
we
could
compare
what
happens--
ms.
jane
moran
--oh,
yes,
your
honor.
the
litigation
over
attorney's
fees
and...
and
the
affidavits
that
were
submitted
to--
ms.
jane
moran
--yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
jane
moran
i
don't
know
whether
i
can
absolutely
balance
the
two--
ms.
jane
moran
--but
the
affidavits
that
were
submitted
to
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
show
that
there
are
considerable
periods
of
time
of
waiting
after
the
fee
is
approved.
ms.
jane
moran
that's
right.
that's
correct.
ms.
jane
moran
well,
the
language
of
the
regulation
directly
applies
to
the...
the
necessity
to
submit
fee
applications
to
different
bodies,
to
different
judicial
bodies
and...
and
as
is
explained
in
the
affidavit,
one
of
the
things
that
happens
is
you
present
a
petition
to
the
deputy
commissioner.
the
file
is
in
the
administrative
law
judge's
office,
and
it
takes
two
years
to
get
from
the
administrative
law
judge's
office
back
down
to
the
deputy
commissioner.
this
is
specifically
what
is
described
in
the
affidavits.
ms.
jane
moran
well,
i...
i'm
not
arguing
with
the...
with
the
reasonable
attorney's
fees,
your
honor.
i'm
arguing
with
the
method
that
one
must
use
to
attach
the--
ms.
jane
moran
--to
require
the
department's
consent?
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
find
some
kind
of
regulation
to
be
inconsistent.
ms.
jane
moran
the
regulation
is
that
they
have
created
a
very
cumbersome
manner
of
us
collecting
the
fees
which
adds
a
great
deal
of
time
to
the...
to
the
time
involved
for
processing,
and
also
that
when...
when
this
is
applied,
that
a
reasonable
fee
becomes
less
reasonable
when
you
have
to
wait
ten
years
for
it.
ms.
jane
moran
no,
no,
they're
not...
no,
your
honor,
they
do
not
argue
that
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
they
argue
that
it
is
unconstitutional
as
applied.
i
mean,
that's
their
position,
that
it
is
unconstitutional
as
applied.
ms.
jane
moran
and
as
generally
applied
in
the
state
of
west
virginia.
ms.
jane
moran
i
would
say
the
regulation
that
is
between
the
two,
between
the
statute
and
the
application,
and...
and
that
is
what
we're
attacking...
is
that
the
regulation
creates
such
a
cumbersome
way
of...
of
proceeding.
i...
i--
ms.
jane
moran
--i
am
claiming
that
the...
the
regulation
is
an
unconstitutional
application
of
the
statute.
ms.
jane
moran
well,
it
is
unconstitutional,
your
honor,
in
that
the
method
in
which
it's
applied
prohibits
people
access
to
counsel
to
represent
them
in
their
claims.
of
the
23
percent
that
ms.
denney
found
an
indication
of
an
award
or
a
denial
of
benefits,
she
tells
us
that
claimants
with
counsel
had
a
better
than
two-to-one
chance
of
winning
as
compared
to
those
who
did
not
have
counsel.
every
piece
of
evidence
that
was
in
front
of
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
indicates
that
there
is
a
serious
problem
in
the
availability
of
counsel.
in
addition,
in
our
brief
we
cite
a
law
review
article
by
alan
prunty
and
mark
solomons.
alan
prunty
is
the
head
of
the
administrative...
the
administrative
head
of
the
black
lung
division
of
jackson
&
kelly,
which
is
a
law
firm
in
charleston
that
represents
more
responsible
operators
than
any
other
law
firm
in
the
country.
mr.
solomons
was
with
the
department
of
labor
from
1983
until
1980
and
has
appeared
many
times
in
front
of
this
court.
both
mr.
prunty
and
mr.
solomons
concur
with
the
findings
of
the
west
virginia
supreme
court.
they
recognize
this
as
a
real
and
a
widespread
problem,
and
their
article
says
it
will
not
be
resolved
until
there
is
some
accommodation
in
the
attorney
fee
structure.
probably
the
single
most
important
failing
in
ms.
denney's
statistics--
ms.
jane
moran
--i
seek
from
this
court--
ms.
jane
moran
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
asking
that.
i
think
that
appropriately
that
is
to
be
done
by
the
department
of
labor.
however,
if
we
have
suggestions
i
am
asking
that
this
court
uphold
the
west
virginia
supreme
court's
ruling
that
it
is
unconstitutional
in
its
application.
ms.
jane
moran
no.
and
i
think--
ms.
jane
moran
--i
think
that's
a
very
important
point
for
me
to
make
if
i
have
failed
to
do
it,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
the
position
that
the
department
of
labor
is
taking,
that
we
are...
we
are
asking
for
an
absolute
bar
of
regulation.
we
are
not.
we
do
not
find
it
inappropriate
that
there
is
some
form
of
regulation,
and
the
amicus
brief
supports
us
in
that.
ms.
jane
moran
that's...
that's
not
my
only
complaint,
your
honor.
i
am
also
complaining
that
the
system
is
so
burdensome
that
it
is
a
disincentive
to
attorneys
to
take
the
cases.
ms.
jane
moran
--along
with
the
actual
dollar
fee.
ms.
jane
moran
your
honor,
i
think
what
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
says
is
that
it...
it's
more
complex
than
that,
that
he
was...
that
he
was
asked
to
seek
approval
of
a
fee
which
is
being
controlled
in
an
unconstitutional
manner.
i
think...
i
think
the
supreme...
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
finds
that
it
is
a
rather
complex
system
that
he
was
being
asked
to
follow.
it's
not...
the...
i
don't
think
the
supreme
court
has
said
that
it
an
absolute
bar
on
regulation.
one
thing
that
it
is
very
important
to
communicate
to
the
court
that
is...
that
was
missing
from
ms.
denney's
figures
is
the
picture
of
representation
on
the
other
side,
which
has
always
been
an
important
factor
to
this
court
in
determining
due
process
issues.
in
fact,
the
benefit
trust
fund
is
always
represented
by
the
solicitor
general's
office.
it
is
virtually
unheard
of
for
an
identified
responsible
operator
to
appear
unrepresented.
these
claims...
the
actuarial
tables
cited
in
our
brief
show
that
these
claims
are
worth
$150,000
over
the
lifetime
of
the
coal
miner
and
his
family,
and
responsible
operators
are--
ms.
jane
moran
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
jane
moran
that's
correct.
ms.
jane
moran
well,
i
think
at
the
very
beginning,
your
honor,
they
were
using
the
same
system
that
we
use
now
with
social
security
which...
it
requires
regulation.
it
requires
fee
approval.
but
the
understanding
was
that
the
attorneys
could
get
up
to
25
percent
of
the
back
benefits.
when
they
went
from--
ms.
jane
moran
--they
were
applying
the
system
that
is
used
by
the
social
security
system,
yes.
ms.
jane
moran
and
also,
a
thing
that
has
to
be
considered
in
evaluating
that,
your
honor,
is
like
the
walters
va
system.
at
that
time
it
was
a
user-friendly
system.
the
approval
rates
were
very
high,
and
it...
the
government...
the
representatives
of
the
government
were
obliged
to
help
people
with
their
claims.
in
fact,
counsel
for
the
department
of
labor...
it...
there
is
regulation
in
the
black
lung
regulations
that
provide
for
appointment
of
counsel.
and
at
one
point
the
department
of
labor
did
provide
counsel
for
claimants
to
represent
an
initial
award
when
it
was
being
challenged
by
the
responsible
operator,
which
it
is
90
percent
of
the
time.
they
also...
the
department
of
labor
also
provided
informal
conferences,
as
the
social
security
administration
does,
to
work
with
people
and
to
help
unrepresented
people
put
their
claims
together.
both
of
those
practices
have
been
discontinued
without
any
explanation.
there's...
i
would
contend
that
this
is
a
clear
recognition
on
the
part
of
the
department
that
people
need
help.
the
department
of
labor
argues
that
we
should
use
fundamental
fairness,
and
i
would
go
along
with
that.
that's
fine.
goldberg
and
mathews
tell
us
that
it
is...
fundamental
fairness
is
a
procedure
that
is
tailored
to
the
capacities
and
circumstances
of
those
to
be
heard
to
ensure
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard.
the
department
of
labor
argues
we
can't
provide
for
better
representation
of
claimants
because
it
will
cost
money
and
because
it
will
make
the
process
more
adversarial.
in
other
words,
if
we
ensure
that
claimants
are
as
well
represented
as
the
operators
and
the
trust
fund,
there's
a
real
danger
that
eligible
miners
who
are
now
being
lost
in
the
morass
are,
in
fact,
going
to
be
able
to
successfully
pursue
their
claim
and
they're
going
to
demand
benefits.
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
found
that
this
was
an
unconstitutional
kind
of
fiscal
responsibility
which
is
denying
the
benefits
that
congress
has
promised
to
sick
old
coal
miners
who,
by
the
way,
the
department
of
labor
tells
us
three-quarters
of
the
claimants
never
attended
high
school.
so,
we
have
the...
these
sick
old
coal
miners
with
less
than
a
grade
school
education
defending
their
claims
against
highly
paid,
skillful
experts
in
the
field
of
black
lung
law.
it
is
not
surprising
that
we
only
have
a
5
percent
approval
rate
at
this
time.
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
found
that
this
was
unacceptable
and
cannot
be
tolerated.
thank
you.
