unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
this
case
comes
to
us
in
a
rather
peculiar
posture,
does
it
not?
this
was
not
an
enforcement
proceeding
brought
by
the
department
of
labor
below--
unknown
speaker
--against
some
lawyer
who
accepted
unapproved
fees.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
that
decision
doesn't
bind
the
united
states,
in
any
event,
if
it
chose
to
enforce
it
some
other
way?
unknown
speaker
do
you...
do
you
think
the
government
has
any
standing
problem
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
how
did
you
get
to
be
a
party
below?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
dreeben,
the
committee
on
legal
ethics
has
virtually
indicated
that
it
doesn't
care
one
way
or
the
other.
i
mean,
if
there
is
a...
a
federal
law
that
is
valid,
they're
willing
to
enforce
it.
if
there
isn't,
they're
not
going
to.
i...
i
don't
see
that
they're...
they
have
a
real
interest
at
stake
here
by
virtue
of
what
they're
saying.
unknown
speaker
so
what...
what
business
have
you
got
in
taking
up
their
cause?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
we
mustn't
reach
your
standing...
the
question
of
your
standing?
unknown
speaker
may...
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question
in
these
preliminary
matters?
is
there
any
enforcement
proceeding
pending,
or
has
the
department
indicated
any
desire
to
bring
an
enforcement
proceeding
against
this
lawyer?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
if
a
lawyer
just,
without
regard
to
local
discipline,
just
went
ahead
and
ignored
the
regulations
and
charged
people
fees
that
the
department
didn't
approve
and
all,
there
would
be
no
remedy,
other
than...
other
than
ethical
remedy?
unknown
speaker
no,
assume
no
fraud;
just
assume
they...
they
think
it's
a
bad
statute
and
the
people
are
entitled
to
representation,
and
they're
willing
to
work
for
a
black
lung
claimant
if
they
get
paid.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
also,
is...
is
that
also
the
practice
under
the
longshoremen's
act,
which
i
guess
is
the
basis
for...
for
this
procedure,
that
they...
they
don't
really
enforce
the
provision,
other
than
relying
on
local
bar
associations?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
preliminary
question?
what
is
the
impact
of
the
regulations
on
the
situation
in
which
a
potential
claimant
would
like
to
consult
an
attorney
about
whether
or
not
he
has
a
valid
claim
that
he'd
like
to
pursue?
may
he
do
that
and
pay
the
attorney
for
that
advice?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
government
interest
that
justifies
that
prohibition?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this
question?
supposing
the
government
would
advance
the
same
interest
in
all
other
claims
against
the
government
for
which
attorneys
fees
can
be
recovered
if
the
plaintiff
is
successful...
civil
rights
claims
of
one
kind
or
another
and
claims
against
the
government...
would
you
think
that
would
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
government
has
to
come
up
with
money
to
pay
people
whose
constitutional
rights
are
violated
if
they
sue
them
[inaudible].
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
they
have
to
budget
for
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
i...
i
thought
the
government's
position
was
that
there
is
no...
no
constitutional
obligation
to
provide
attorney's
fees
anyway.
and
i
assume
there
is
no
constitutional
obligation
to
provide
attorney's
fees
for
1983
actions
either.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
part
of
your
argument
was
that
mathews
doesn't
even
apply
anyway
because
this
is
not
the
taking
away
of
a...
that...
that
it...
it
is
not
a
mathews
kind
of
a
benefit.
didn't
the
government
make
that
argument
here?
unknown
speaker
to...
to
take
the
benefit
away
from
the
person--
unknown
speaker
--but
isn't
there
also
a
liberty
interest
involved,
if
just
any
ordinary
citizen
wants
to
talk
to
a
lawyer
about
the
possibility
of
suing
somebody,
and
the...
and
there's
a
category
of
cases
that
you
are
saying
the
government
could
say,
no,
you
can't
do
that
if
you
have
to
pay
him.
the
only
way
you
can
consult
a
lawyer
is
if
he's
willing
to
do
it
for
free.
and
you
can
say
that
in
the
black
lung
area,
but
you're
not
so
sure
about
it
in
the
civil
rights
area.
but
is...
isn't
there...
that
possibly
of
some
constitutional
significance,
that
just
the
ordinary
citizen's
desire
to...
to
get
advice?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
isn't
there
also
another
interest?
i
mean
of
course
if
you
file
a
claim
you
want
to
get
the
benefit,
but...
but
most
situations,
before
somebody
gets
involved
in
a
lawsuit,
the
person
wants
to
know
whether
all
the...
the
turmoil
that's
associated
with
litigation
is
worth
the
trouble.
and
you...
you
just
don't
like
to
have
people
blithely
going
ahead
and
suing.
sometimes
they
need...
need
good
advice
on
whether
it's
worth
the...
the
mental
anguish
and
all
the
other
difficulties
and
burdens
associated
with
litigation
to
get
involved
in
it.
and
what
you're
saying,
in
effect,
is
that
that
decision
on
whether
to
assume
that
cost
of
prosecuting
a
claim
must
be
made
without
the
benefit
of
counsel,
unless
counsel
is
willing
to
work
for
nothing.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
in
that
respect,
is
this
program
any
different
from
the
veterans'
administration
program
that
we've
upheld?
that
is
to
say,
would
they
have
allowed
the
lawyers
to
charge
fees
for
initial
consultation?
unknown
speaker
for
everything.
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
it
were
shown,
counsel,
that
in
a
significant
number
of
cases,
a
meritorious
claim
was
not
prosecuted
because
the
fee
schedule
was
unreasonably
restrictive
or
unreasonably
low.
what
would
be
your
position
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
part
of
my
hypothetical
was
that
a
significant
number
of
meritorious
claims
were
not
prosecuted
as
a
result
of
the
low
fee
schedule
or
restrictive
fee
schedule.
and
i
think
your
answer
was,
oh
well,
the
act
allows
those
claims
to
be
prosecuted
anyway.
but
you
then
took
away
one
of
my
factual
predicates.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
what
would
be...
what
would
be
the
grounds
for
the
constitutional
objection,
the
first
amendment
ground
that
you
were
barred
from
seeking
an
entitlement?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the...
do
you
think
there's
a...
justice
scalia
brought
this
up.
do
you
think
there's
a
constitutional
right
for
the
government
to
pay
for
counsel
and
before...
in
a
hearing
to
determine
the
entitlement
to
benefits?
do
you
think
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
counsel
in
this
case?
i...
i...
perhaps
there
is,
as
in
goldberg,
if
the
party
wants
to
hire
one,
you
have
to
permit
the
counsel.
but
is
there
a
constitutional
right
to
provide
counsel?
unknown
speaker
well
goldberg...
goldberg
said
that
the
government
doesn't
need
to
provide
counsel
in
a
pre-termination
hearing--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
the
claimant
has
the
right
to--
unknown
speaker
--hire
his
own.
unknown
speaker
but
weren't
you
suggesting,
in
answer
to
my
and
several
other
questions,
that
there
is
constitutional
authority
to
prohibit
counsel?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
think
that
latitude
would
go
to
the
extent
that
where
the
defendants
can
have
lawyers,
as
i
guess
they
can
here,
the
government
could
say
that
those
interests
would
best
be
served
by
flatly
prohibiting
lawyers
for
all
claimants
because
they'll
get
a
fair
hearing,
the
tribunals
will
look
out
for
their
interests,
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
well,
sure
it
would
be
a
harder
case,
but
what
do
you
think
about
the...
outcome
of
that
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
we
do
have
an
adjudicatory
model
here,
unlike
the
veterans
system,
because
the
government
doesn't
pay
the
awards
here,
and
the
people
who
do
have
their
own
lawyers.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
not
in
one
category.
isn't
one
category
entirely
financed
by
the
operators?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
directing
my
question
to
that
category.
unknown
speaker
and
the
question
is
whether
all
of
that
is
sufficient
if,
say,
one
side
can
have
a
lawyer
but
the
other
side
can't.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
would
be
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
dreeben.
ms.
moran?
unknown
speaker
ms.
moran,
i
don't...
it
seems
to
me
that...
i
don't
know
that
we
can
very
well
tell
how
many
people
are
not
being
represented
on
the
basis
of
scattered
indications
by
judge
litt
or
anybody
else
if
there
are
no
impossible
for
me
to
predict
whether
they
are
going
to
do
the
things
that
i
think
they
should
do.
and
our
problem
right
now,
which
has
been
recognized
by
the
west
virginia
supreme
court,
is
that
we
have
many
black
lung
claimants
with
good
claims
that
are
being
lost
because
of
the
manner
in
which
the
law
is
being
applied
by
the
department
of
labor.
the
briefs
would
have
this
court
believe
that
92
percent
of
the
black
lung
claimants
are
being
represented.
this
figure
is
grossly
misleading,
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
look
very
closely
at
the
source
of
these
figures.
the
department
tells
us
that
they
have
never
kept
any
statistics
on
this,
so
in
december
of
1988
they
had
their
employee,
miss
denney,
go
to
the
administrative
law
judge's
office,
and
she
reviewed
approximately
3,700
files
which
had
been
docketed
with
the
administrative
law
judge's
office
in
fiscal
1987.
in
december
of
1988,
she
found
that
77.1
percent
of
those
cases
had
been
either
dismissed,
remanded,
or
she
found
no
decision
there.
in
december.
this
is
one
year...
over
one
year--
--now,
where
do
we
find
this,
counsel?
this
is
in
the
record
of
the
supreme
court...
the
state
supreme
court?
unknown
speaker
so
if
what
you
say
is
correct,
why
do
we
have
any
reason
to
believe
that
congress
won't
change?
and
they're
in
a
much
better
position
than
we
are
to
figure
out
whether
people
who
should
be
represented
aren't?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you,
the
supreme
court
made
some
of
its
own
findings
of
fact
at
the
appellate
level
in
the
state
system?
unknown
speaker
is
your
challenge
to
the
statute
a
facial
challenge?
unknown
speaker
as
it's
applied
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
did
the
department
of
labor
in
the
state
supreme
court
ask
the
case
be
remanded
to
the
trial
court
for
further
findings?
unknown
speaker
this
all
arises
out
of
a
department
of
labor
regulation,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
regulation
is
what
sets
the
fee,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
sets--
unknown
speaker
--is
it
the
regulation
that
sets
consent?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
to
have...
does
the
regulation
or
does
the
statute
say
that
you
need
consent
to
have
a--
unknown
speaker
--well,
isn't
that
what's
at
issue
here?
unknown
speaker
you
must
argue
that
the
regulation
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
there's
no
basis
for
the
department
of
labor
to
construe
the
statute
the
way
it
has
under
its
regulation,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
it's
just
irrational
to
construe
the
statute
in
this
way,
that
there's
no
other
way
to
construe
the
statute
other
than
what
you
urge?
unknown
speaker
ordinarily,
we
wouldn't
get
to
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
until...
if
you're
arguing
that
the
regulation
isn't
supported
by
the
statute.
and
if
you
were
to
accept
that--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
have
anything
more
to
say
on
that
subject?
i
mean,
ordinarily
we
give
a
considerable
deference
to
the
views
of
a
department
to
whom
congress
has
confided
the
administration
of
the
act
as
to
regulation.
unknown
speaker
i
think
maybe
they're
very...
maybe
they're
very
generous
at
the
first
level.
i
mean,
that
would
explain
it
as
well
as
anything
else.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
this
is
a
benefits
program.
i
assume
that
labor
regards
this
as
a
benefits
program.
unknown
speaker
at
the
initial
stage?
unknown
speaker
what
were
you
saying
about
the
appeals?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
the
96
percent
that
are
denied
have
counsel.
unknown
speaker
what
percent
of
that?
unknown
speaker
miss
moran,
i
guess
they
aren't
allowing
reasonable
fees
then.
i
mean,
if
they
are
not...
if
lawyers
are
not
coming
into
the
system,
the
fees
being
allowed
are
not
reasonable.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
don't
have
any
argument
with
the
agency
over
that.
they
say
that
they're
supposed
to
be
giving
out
reasonable
fees.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
should
be
litigating
is
before
the
agency
whether
they
are
giving
out
high
enough
fees.
but
the...
i
mean,
the
system
can
work
so
long
as
they
give
high
enough
fees,
isn't
that
right?
there's
nothing
inherently
bad
about
the
system.
unknown
speaker
well,
however
you
determine
it,
it
doesn't
render
the
statute
unconstitutional.
it
just
means
the
agency
is
not
giving
high
enough
fees
to
bring
lawyers
into
the
system.
isn't
that
your
basic
complaint?
unknown
speaker
the
regulation
says
reasonable
fees.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
what's
the
matter
is
that
in
each
case
enough
fee
is
not
being
given,
and
the
lawyers
should
litigate
to
get
more
fees.
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the
solution.
every
time
an
agency
doesn't
live
up
to
its
regulation,
we
don't
strike
the
regulation
down.
we
say
you
have
to
live
up
to
it.
unknown
speaker
if
he's
not
getting
interest,
he
should
get
higher
fees.
i
think
a
fee
without
interest
should
be
higher
than
a
fee
that
draws
interest
until
the
time
it's
paid,
and
that
argument
should
be
made
to
the
agency.
unknown
speaker
take
them
to
court.
unknown
speaker
and
you
will
get
a
judge
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
say
this
is
arbitrary
and
capricious
action.
you
have
a
regulation
that
says
reasonable
fees.
you
are
not
paying
reasonable
fees.
unknown
speaker
when
would...
when
would
this
lawyer
who...
who
didn't
get
consent
of
the
agency,
when
would
he
get
paid,
if
he
won?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
know,
but
here...
here's
a
lawyer
who
says
i
should
be
free
from
this
consent
requirement.
i
should
be
able
to
make
my
own
deal
with
a
particular
client.
so,
he
says
he...
he...
establishes...
he...
he
makes
a
contingency
arrangement
with
them.
now,
he
isn't
going
to
get
paid
until
there's
a
final
decision,
is
he?
unknown
speaker
and
so
the...
that's
going
to
be
considerably
delayed,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
would
he
be
paid
any
sooner
than
he
would
be
under
the...
under
the--
unknown
speaker
--it
takes
as
long
after
the
final
decision--
unknown
speaker
--to...
to
litigate
attorneys
fees
as
it
did
to
get
the
liability
judgment,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
he
isn't
going
to
get
paid
at
all
if
he
doesn't
win?
unknown
speaker
but
how
does...
how
does
that
bear
on
the
validity
of
the
regulation?
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
there
is
anything
in
the
language
of
the
regulation
that
imposes
that
delay.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
it
hard
to
say
that
the
regulation
that
calls
for
the
payment
of
reasonable
attorney's
fees,
isn't
it
hard
to
say
that's
inconsistent
with
the
statute?
what...
what
should
the
regulation
say?
unknown
speaker
and
is
there
any...
do
you
think
there's
any...
anything
inconsistent
with
the
statute
to
require
consent
for
a
private
agreement?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
what's
wrong
with
this
regulation?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
you...
you
really
don't
argue
on
the
same
basis,
then,
as
the
supreme
court
of
west
virginia
did
or...
the...
it's
holding
was
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
you're
really
not
arguing
that?
unknown
speaker
well...
what...
what's
the...
what's
the
difference?
you...
the...
you
mean
it
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
mr.
triplett?
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
what's
the
difference
between
saying
a
statute
is
unconstitutional
as
generally
applied
in
the
state
of
west
virginia
and
saying
it's
unconstitutional
in
toto?
unknown
speaker
are
you...
are
you
claiming
that
the
statute
is...
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there
is...
do
you
really
need
to
say
that
the...
if
the
regulation
doesn't
conform
to
the
statute,
i
would
think
say
it...
it's
not
supported
by
the
statute.
it's
not
authorized
by
the
statute
rather
than
it's
an
unconstitutional
application
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me,
ms....
ms.
moran,
if
some
accommodation
in
the
fee
structure...
what
do
you
seek
from
this
court?
unknown
speaker
do
you
want
us
to
write
a
whole
new
structure
or...
or--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
wait.
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
in
order
for
the
individual
who's
been...
who...
who's
been
charged
with
practicing
unlawfully,
in
order
for
him
to
vindicate
himself
against
that
charge,
we
would
have
to
strike
down
that...
we
would
have
to
say
under
no
circumstances
is
it
valid
to
prevent
a
lawyer
from
charging
a
fee
that
isn't
approved
by
the
agency.
don't
we
have
to
find
that
that
provision
could
not
under
any
reasonable
system
be
left
in
place?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
have
to
say
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
this
lawyer
win,
then,
if
it's
okay
to
prevent
him
from
charging
a
fee
that
isn't
approved
by
the
agency?
if
your
only
complaint
is
the
agency
is
not
approving
high
enough
fees,
he
loses.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
don't
you
have
to
establish--
unknown
speaker
--that
it's
burdensome
in
the
specific
respect
that
it
requires
a
lawyer
to
get
his
fee
approved
by
the
agency?
that
is...
that
is
what
this
lawyer
was
charged
of...
charged
with.
that's
the
provision
he
violated.
if
you
don't
establish
that
that
provision
is
unconstitutional,
is...
could
not
be
there
in
any
good
system,
then
it
seems
to
me
he
was
properly--
unknown
speaker
--ms.
moran,
may
i
ask
one...
may
i
ask
one
other
background
fact?
unknown
speaker
these
claims,
as
i
remember
during
a
period
before
'73
or
4
sometime,
were
administered
by
hew
rather
than
the
secretary
of
labor
and
the
government
picked
up
the
tab.
unknown
speaker
did
the
hew
have
the
same
rules
about
attorney's
fees
that
labor
does?
unknown
speaker
so,
it
was
the
social
security
system
rather
than
the...
than
this
particular
labor--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
moran.
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
am
i
correct
that
the
agency
concedes
that
the
rate
has
to
be
high
enough
to
allow
for
the
contingency?
