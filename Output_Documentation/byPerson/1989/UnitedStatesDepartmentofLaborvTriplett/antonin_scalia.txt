justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
appeals
of
west
virginia.
it
concerns
the
black
lung
benefits
act
which
prohibits
attorneys
from
receiving
fees
for
representing
claimants
except
as
those
fees
are
approved
by
the
department
of
labor.
the
department’s
regulations
invalidate
all
contractual
fee
agreements.
respondent
is
an
attorney
who
represented
claimants
on
a
contingent
fee
basis
and
he
collected
those
fees
without
the
requisite
approval.
the
committee
on
legal
ethics
of
the
state
bar
recommended
that
respondent
be
suspended,
but
the
west
virginia
supreme
court
of
appeals
denied
enforcement
ruling
that
the
prohibition
on
receipt
of
contingency
fees
violated
the
claimant’s
due
process
rights
by
denying
them
access
to
counsel.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
we
first
conclude
that
petitioner,
committee
on
legal
ethics,
has
standing
and
that
respondent
has
third
party
standing
to
raise
his
client’s
due
process
claims.
on
the
merits,
we
find
that
respondent
has
failed
to
prove
that
the
scheme
he
challenges
made
attorneys
unavailable
to
his
prospective
clients
at
the
time
he
violated
the
act.

two
