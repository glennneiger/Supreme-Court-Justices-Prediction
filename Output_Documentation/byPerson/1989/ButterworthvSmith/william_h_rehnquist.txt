we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-1993,
robert
a.
butterworth
v.
michael
smith.
mr.
waas.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
see
that,
i
don't
see
that
it
necessarily
is.
i
wouldn't
have
read
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion
to
say
that
the
florida
statute
was
invalid
insofar
as
it
prohibited
the
revelation
of
the
questions
asked
to
the
witness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose...
supposing
the
florida
statute
had
been
held
invalid
by
the
eleventh
circuit
only
insofar
as
it
prevented
a
witness
from
disclosing
his
own
testimony,
but
it
also
said
that
the
witness,
in
disclosing
his
own
testimony,
could
not
do
it
in
question
and
answer
form.
that
the
only
thing
the
witness
could
do
would
be
either
to
repeat
his
answers
or
to
give
a
paraphrase
of
his
testimony.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice
stevens
asked
you
to
give
him
a
hypothetical.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
--but
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
strike
down
that
part
of
the
statute.
that
isn't
the
witness'
own
testimony.
that's
something
he
learned
as
a
result
of
being
in
the
grand
jury...
the
grand
jury
room.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
whole
law
is
devoted
to
putting
parameters
around
things.
what
you're
saying
in
effect
is
that
although
there
is
no
evil
involved
in
situation
a,
there
would
be
involved
in
situation
b,
and
therefore
you
are
entitled
to
prohibit
both
of
them.
but
that
isn't
our
first
amendment
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
waas,
that
the
position
you
contend
for
really
has
a
potential
for
abuse.
a
district
attorney
could
summon
someone
before
the
grand
jury
who
is
about
to
blow
the
whistle
on
some
governmental
operation
and
in
effect
seal
his
lips,
wouldn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
your
only
quarrel
then
with
the
eleventh
circuit's
disposition
of
this
case
is
that
you're
afraid
its
disposition
would
allow
the
release
not
only
of
the
answers
of
a
witness
in
the
grand
jury
but
the
questions
as
well?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
let's
not
get
into
these
vague
abstractions.
what
else
does
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
forbid
you
to
do
that
you
want
to
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
said
what
else,
other
than
what
we
have
just
talked
about,
does
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
forbid
you
to
do
which
you
want
to
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
this
is
a
very
general
response,
mr.
waas.
i
was
hoping
for
something
more
specific.
where...
you
say
that
the
grand...
that
the
witness
is
perfectly
free
to
give
the
substance
of
his
testimony
elsewhere.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
you're
afraid
of
is
that
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
will
not
only
allow
that,
but
it
will
allow
disclosure
of
a
transcript
which
would
show
questions
as
well
as
answers.
now,
what
else
is
there
in
addition
to
that?
now
think
before
you
answer
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you're
not
going
to
protect
the
innocent
accused
if
the
guy
goes
out
and
says
the
same
thing
as
he
has
said
before
the
grand
jury.
the
same
names
will
be
in
that
disclosure
as
were
disclosed
to
the
grand
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
you're
saying
is
if
the
grand
jury
door
is
open
only
as
far
as
the
eleventh
circuit
opened
it,
it
necessarily
is
going
to
be
all
the
way
open.
and
all
of
our
cases
suggest
that
isn't
true.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
waas.
mr.
thomas.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
one
learn
things
from
the
questions
that
are
asked
you?
by
having
your
memory
stimulated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
it
that
you
can't
do
under
the
interpretation
of
the
florida
statute
that
we
now
have
before
us
from
your
opponent,
of
the
things
you
just
said?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
thomas.
mr.
waas,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waas.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
butterworth
against
smith.
in
this
case,
the
respondent,
michael
smith,
was
a
reporter
who
obtained
information
relevant
to
alleged
improprieties
committed
by
the
state
attorney’s
office
in
the
sheriff’s
department
in
the
charlotte
county,
florida.
it
was
then
called
before
a
special
grand
jury
which
had
been
convened
to
investigate
the
allegation.
at
the
time
he
testified,
he
was
warned
by
florida
officials
not
to
reveal
his
testimony
in
any
manner
since
he
could
be
found
criminally
liable
for
violating
a
florida
law
which
prohibits
a
grand
jury
witness
from
ever
disclosing
the
content,
gist,
or
import
of
testimony
given
before
that
body.
after
the
investigation
ended,
smith
set
out
to
publish
a
news
story
about
the
subject
matter
of
the
investigation
and
he
sued
the
state
of
florida
seeking
a
declaration
that
the
florida
law,
which
i
have
mentioned,
violated
the
first
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
held
that
this
florida
law
was
unconstitutional
to
the
extent
that
it
prohibits
a
witness
from
speaking
about
his
testimony
after
a
grand
jury
investigation
has
terminated.
we
granted
certiorari
to
review
this
judgment
and
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
florida’s
interest
in
prohibiting
a
grand
jury
witness
from
disclosing
his
own
testimony
after
an
investigation
has
ended
are
insufficient
to
overcome
smith’s
first
amendment
right
to
make
a
truthful
statement
of
information
he
acquired
outside
the
grand
jury
room.
accordingly,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
decision
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
