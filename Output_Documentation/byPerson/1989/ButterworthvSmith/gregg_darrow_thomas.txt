mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
almost
four
years
ago
mike
smith
was
compelled
to
do
what
citizens
in
our
society
should
rarely
be
compelled
to
do.
he
was
compelled
to
remain
silent,
silent
about
information
he
had
personally
gathered,
lawfully,
by
himself,
and
then
surrendered
to
the
grand
jury.
silent
not
for--
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
--your
honor,
the
problem
with
that
is--
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
--your
honor,
certainly
that
is
true,
but
also
the
problem
with
the
ability
to
put
into
column
a
what
he
learned
or
knew
before
the
grand
jury
and
what
he
learned
as
a
result
of
the
grand
jury,
and
differentiate
that
so
he
is
not
prosecuted
criminally
for
his
speech.
the
problem
is,
he
goes
into
a
grand
jury
proceeding
and
he
may
be
there
for
several
hours.
when
he
leaves
the
grand
jury
he
may
not
be
able
to
say
well,
what
i
learned
as
a
result
of
that
is
a,
and
what
i
knew
when
i
went
in
is
b.
so--
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
--yes,
your
honor.
there
are
certainly
things
he
learned
from
the
questions
they
were
asking.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
well,
certainly,
your
honor.
also
by
the
tone
of
the
question
or
the
import
of
it.
where
the
question
was
going.
i
mean,
it
may
indicate
that
the
grand
jury
was
interested
in
something
here.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
yes,
your
honor,
he
does
want
to
reveal
the
questions
too.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
your
honor,
certainly
if
that
was
the
case
that
statute
would
be
grossly
unconstitutional.
here
there
is
intent
by
the
state
to
limit
what
the
statute
means
in
one
point
and
then
broaden
it
in
another.
i
think
the
breadth
is
at
the
point
where
the
state
says
what
covers
the
identities
of
grand
jurors.
how
could...
how
could
the
testimony,
content
or
import
of
it,
ever
cover
the
identities
of
grand
jurors?
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
your
honor,
there
is
no
definitive
interpretation
of
the
statute
in
florida
state
court.
they
have
asserted
that
the
statute
means
more
than
that
in
this
proceeding
below.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
yes,
your
honor,
that
is,
by
the
breadth
that
i
just
mentioned,
the
identities
of
the
grand
jurors
and
comments
made.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
your
honor,
that
is
definitely
contrary
to
the
assertion
that
they
made
in
their
briefs.
unless
i
have
misread
them
now
for
the
two
and
a
half
years
we
have
been
in
this
litigation,
i
thought
that
the
state
had
always
contended
that
the
identities
of
the
grand
jurors
were
important
factors
in
this
case.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
yes,
your
honor,
i
did.
and
i
guess
i
am
a
little
bit
baffled
by
it.
it's
a
concession
that
i
think
is
appropriate
given
the
nature
of
the
statute.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
and
the
answers,
your
honor,
and
the
ability
to
say
i
testified.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
yes,
your
honor,
but
he
will
not
concede
the
fact
that
a
person
can
say
i
testified
before
the
grand
jury
to
the
following.
it's...
if
he
compartmentalizes
it...
that...
you
say
i
testified
before
the
grand
jury,
and
then
later
you
say
what
the
substance
of
your
testimony
is.
here
it
is
vitally
significant
that
a
witness
before
a
grand
jury
at
some
time
be
able
to
say
i
testified
to
the
grand
jury
the
following.
if
i
can
give
your
honors
a
hypothetical
of
that.
let's
suppose
a
victim
to
a
violent
crime
appeared
before
a
grand
jury.
she
testified
as
to
the
identity
of
her
assailant
unequivocally.
there
was
no
true
bill
returned,
and
later
she
found
out
that
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury
was
the
nephew
of
the
assailant.
that
person,
in
our
society,
should
be
able
to
stand
up
at
some
point
and
say
i
testified
before
the
grand
jury.
i
told
them
who
the
assailant
was.
they
refused
to
indict,
and
it
was
because
there
was
a
conflict
of
interest
between
the
foreman
and
the
assailant.
that
sort
of
speech
is,
as
your
honors
have
recognized
in
cases
like
wood
v.
georgia,
absolutely
critical.
in
1962,
i
believe
you
said
in
wood
v.
georgia,
that
the
grand
jury
does
not
function
in
a
vacuum.
it
is
not
an
isolated
body,
but
rather
an
institution
about
which
people
should
speak
and
speak
often.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
i
testified,
your
honor,
that...
and
identified
the
assailant
who
was.
it's
the
combination
of
those,
your
honor,
that
the
state
finds
offensive.
you
can
release
the
information,
the
state
concedes
that.
but
you
just
can't
put
the
label
i
testified
on
it.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
your
honor,
as
a
former
law
clerk,
i
know
the
oath.
but
i
don't
think
that...
there
there's
probably
not
a
compelling
need.
this
institution
functions
in,
and
it
functions
at
times
in
a
secret
sense,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
occasional
leaks
that
occur
from
this
court
diminish
the
court,
just
as
it
wouldn't
diminish
the
value
of
the
grand
jury
proceeding
in
florida.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
your
honor,
i
think
there
is
a
problem
with
a
general
rule,
and
especially
if
it
is
a
permanent
and
absolute
ban
on
speech
like
this
one.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
well,
your
honor,
just
like--
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
--your
honor,
grand
jurors
are
in
a
totally
different
setting
than
mr.
smith.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
mr.
smith
comes
into
this
proceeding
having
the
information
that
is
requested.
the
grand
juror
comes
as
essentially
a
clean
slate.
the
grand
juror
is
essentially
the
functionary
of
the
state.
he
is
the
prosecutor,
as
a
citizen
prosecutor,
to
decide
what...
whether
someone
should
be
indicted.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
--your
honor,
the
sting
that
that
has
is
that
it's
someone
inside
the
grand
jury
itself.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
your
honor,
it
does,
and
that
is
why
this
court
can
restrict
the
first
amendment
speech
to
a
grand
juror
to
a
much
greater
extent
than
it
can
to
a
witness.
the
witness
in
the
grand--
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
--well,
i
thought
the
most
credible
speech
here,
your
honor,
would
be
the
witness,
the
victim.
the
grand
juror
would
be
someone
who
would
have
heard
that.
moreover,
your
honor--
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
--your
honor,
i
think
because
the
grand
juror
hears
all
the
testimony.
it
hears
not
only
mr.
smith's
testimony,
but
hears
every
other
witness,
and
it
deliberates
on
it.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
grand
jury
and
the
secrecy
attendant
to
it
is
the
secrecy
of
the
body
itself,
the
deliberative
process,
the
decision-making
process,
the
voting
proces,
and
not
the
witnesses
who
come
from
the
outside.
essentially
here
mr.
smith
comes
before
this
grand
jury
and
reveals
all
the
information
that
he
knew.
he
does
so
and
provides
the
grand
jury
with
all
that
information
which
was
essential.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
your
honors'
decision
i
think
in
branzburg
v.
hayes
decided
that
question,
your
honor,
almost
16
years
ago.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
no,
your
honor.
i
think
the
state
has
an
interest
in
him
revealing
his
testimony.
i
think
that,
as
this
court
said
in
branzburg,
you
need
every
man's
testimony.
the
fact
that
mr.
smith
was
a
reporter,
you've
gotten
his
testimony
in
this
case.
but
now
the
attempt
to
throw
an
enormous
shroud
of
secrecy
over
that,
i
think
that's
what's
offensive
in
this
case
and
distinguishes
it
markedly
from
the
situation
in
branzburg.
if
we
look
at
the
justification--
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
--your
honor,
if
the
person
that
you
are
speaking
of
is
a
member
of
government
and
has
acquired
information
as
a
government
employee,
then
i
think
that
a
greater
degree
of
breadth
of
secrecy
could
be
imposed.
but
here,
when
you
have
a
citizen
who
has
essentially
hailed
from
the
street,
gathered
his
information
not
in
a
governmental
or
security
defense
environment,
but
just
he
viewed
something
happening,
or
as
a
reporter
he
gathered
the
information
as
any
reporter
would,
and
then
to
silence
him
is
the
offensive
part
of
this
statute.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
well,
your
honor,
the
problem
is...
with
general
rules...
is
here
the
chilling
effect
is
substantial
in
its
breadth.
your
honors
have
traditionally
said
in
first
amendment
cases
that
there
needs
to
be
a
narrow
tailoring.
there
needs
to
be
some
attempt
by
the
legislature
to
pick
out
individual
items
which
are
critical
to
the
compelling
interest
of
the
state
or
the
state's
interest
of
the
highest
order.
here
the
state
makes
no
effort
to
do
that,
to
disseminate
what
it
is
that
is
critical
to
the
release
of
grand
jury
information.
they
didn't
draft
a
statute
that
said
you
shall
not
release
the
target
of
a
grand
jury
investigation
until
that
person
is
released.
they
attempted
to
silence
all
speech,
and
i
think
that
the
possibilities
for
abuse
in
this
area
are
substantial,
and
they
are
particularly
so
not
only
because
mr.
smith
is
a
citizen,
but
because
he
is
a
reporter.
certainly
that
distinction
here
is
not
determinative
of
your
decision.
but
if
mr.
smith
is
engaged
in
investigative
reporting,
finds
out
all
sorts
of
information
and
hasn't
published
it,
is
brought
before
a
grand
jury
and
then
given,
as
your
honors
have
said,
the
light
tap
on
the
shoulder
of
the
prosecutor
on
the
way
out,
saying
don't
reveal
any
of
this
information,
it
is
particularly
problematic.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
no,
your
honor,
the
same
first
amendment
privilege
here
would
apply
equally.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
your
honor,
i
think
that
puts
us
right
in
the
middle
of
landmark
communications
sort
of
territory
and
not
in
the
situation
that
we're
in
now.
certainly
the
release
by
the
witness
to
another
person
is
landmark
communications
and
your
decisions
in
daily
mail.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
your
honor,
certainly
they
make
arrest
prior
to
the
indictment,
but
i
think
this
court
affirmed,
i
think
it's
called
worrell
newspapers
v.
westhafer,
you
affirmed
a
seventh
circuit
decision,
although
you
didn't
ride
on
it,
where
there
was
a
statute
that
permitted...
that
prohibited
anyone
from
revealing
the
fact
that
a
sealed
indictment
had
been
returned
against
an
individual.
the
state's
interest
there,
and
indiana
asserted,
was
that
until
the
information...
until
the
defendant
was
in
custody
there
was
a
problem
about
the
release
of
that
information.
this
court
said
that
publication
about
that
was
offensive
to
the
first
amendment.
so,
even
if
the
state
interest
asserted
was
simply
an
interest
that
you
couldn't
speak
about
it
until
the
targeted
defendant
was
arrested
might
not
be
substantial
under
your
honor's
previous
decisions.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
your
honor,
i
don't
think
i'd
concede
that.
i
think
the
eleventh
circuit,
judge
vance,
decided
exactly
what
they
needed
to.
we
were
in
a
situation
where
it
was
after
the
period
of
time
that
the
grand
jury--
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
--yes,
your
honor.
my
position
is
that
while
the
grand
jury
is
going,
this
court
would
have
to
establish
a
compelling
need
to
silence
a
witness,
even
during
the
term
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
your
honor,
i
think
he
should
certainly
be
able
to
publish
what
he
learned.
this
statute
doesn't
prohibit
that,
and
besides
that,
your
honor,
he
is
an
incidental
party
to
the
grand
jury.
if
the
grand
jury
knows
that
that's
the
rule,
as
i
am
sure
they
do
in
the
federal
system,
they
restrict
their
speech
not
to
reveal
information
which
is
of
vital
importance.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
yes,
your
honor,
and
that's--
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
certainly
the
way
it
is
in
the
federal
system.
if
we
look
for
the
last
44
years,
since
1946,
this
court
and
37
other
states
have
permitted
a
witness
to
leave
the
grand
jury
room
and
immediately
essentially
give
a
press
conference
on
the
courthouse
steps.
federal
courts
and
federal
prosecutors
prosecute
such
things
as
rico
violations
and
national
security
matters
and
the
most
egregious
and
heinous
of
crimes,
and
they
do
it
all
with
the
witness
free
to
speak.
the
commentators,
legal
commentators
or
federal
prosecutors
or
judiciary
have
made
no
move,
and
i
don't
think
there
is
anything
pending
before
your
honors
to--
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
no,
your
honor.
as
with
justice
kennedy's
question,
those
people
inside
the
grand
jury
room,
hearing
all
the
testimony
and
motivating
the
progress
of
the
grand
jury,
are
in
distinctly
different
situations
than
the
witness
who
comes
outside
and
gives
information.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
i
do.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
the
way
common
law
is.
and
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
history,
the
history
is
interesting
because
it
does
not
indicate
a
need
to
silence
the
individual
citizen.
the
integrity
and
secrecy
of
the
grand
jury
has
always
been
focused
on
the
deliberative
process
and
the
voting
process,
and
not
the
individual
witness
coming
from
the
outside.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
it's
she,
your
honor.
it's
judge
kovacovich
in
the
middle
district.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
i
think
the
construction
by
the
district
judge
was
very
broad.
it
went
beyond
the
state's
more
limited
position
that's
taken
here.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
your
honor,
i'm
not
certain
whether
they
did
or
not,
and
i
think
that
the
state's
position
here
is
refined
after
reading
your
honors
decision
in
seattle
times
v.
rhinehart
where
you
unequivocally
said
that
if
you
gained
it
from
some
other
source
there
is
no
way
that
you
could
ever
prohibit
it.
mr.
gregg
darrow
thomas
yes,
your
honor,
the
eleventh
circuit
decision
is
ambiguous,
and
i
take
it
to
mean
that
you
can
simply
talk
about
everything
that
happened
in
that
proceeding.
your
honor,
if
you
look,
interestingly,
at
rule
6(e),
it
has
language
which
is
totally
different
than
the
florida
statute.
it
says...
it
identifies
all
the
individuals
and
then
it
says
"shall
not
disclose
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury.
"
well,
that's...
that's
twice,
three
times
as
broad
as
florida
is.
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury
include
questions,
answers,
comments
by
grand
jurors,
statements
by
prosecutors,
evidence
produced.
it's
the
whole
gamut.
and
in
fact
what
florida
has
tried
to
do
is
focus
specifically
on
testimony
and
not
that
broader
purview.
in
conclusion,
your
honors,
i
believe
only
in
the
most
extraordinary
circumstances
should
the
state
be
permitted
to
silence
its
citizens.
this
is
particularly
true
when
the
citizen
is
hailed
from
the
street
by
subpoena
and
forced
to
surrender
information
lawfully
possessed
by
him.
the
constitution
does
not
permit
the
state
to
interrogate
its
unwilling
witnesses
and
then
silence
them.
and
as
justice
white
said
in
branzburg,
we
do
not
expect
courts
will
forget
the
grand
juries
must
operate
within
the
limits
of
the
first
amendment.
thank
you,
your
honor.
