justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
then--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
he
disclose
the
fact
he
testified?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
the
man
in
this
case
get
on
a
news
broadcast
and
say
i
testified
before
the
grand
jury
yesterday.
they
are
investigating
mayor
so
and
so.
i
think
mayor
so
and
so
is
a
crook
because
i
saw
him
do
x,
y
and
z.
period.
that's
all
he
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
perfectly
all
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
that's
the
case,
what
is
the
state
interest...
i'm
sorry,
if
your
answer
to
me
is
correct,
what
is
the
state
interest
in
saying
that's
all
right,
but
it
suddenly
implicates
a
great
state
interest
if
he
adds
the
words
"and
i
so
testified
yesterday"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
this
doesn't
identify...
just
this
particular
case.
what
is
the
state
interest
in
my
hypothetical?
how
can
it
possibly
hurt,
one
hurt
more
than
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
give
me
a
hypothetical
in
which
the
witness'
description
of
his
own
testimony
would
imperil,
after
the
grand
jury
investigation
is
over,
would
imperil
the...
would
be
contrary
to
the
policy
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
he
listen
to
all
the
other
witnesses
testify?
he
doesn't
listen
to
anybody
testify
except
himself.
but
some
grand
juror
says
did
you
see
joe
smith
there,
and
joe
smith
is
the
man
who
might
get
killed
if
he
is
identified.
he
says
yes,
i
saw
him,
he
was
there
on
the
scene
of
the
crime.
so
he
gets
on
the
radio
the
next
day
and
he
doesn't
say
he
testified,
he
says
you
know,
joe
smith
was
at
the
scene
of
the
crime.
and
maybe...
won't
that
kill
joe
smith
just
as
much
as
saying
and
i
so
testified?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
if
any...
may
i
ask...
two
questions
really.
has
anyone...
any
witness
ever
been
prosecuted
under
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
has
the
statute
ever
been
construed
by
the
florida
supreme
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
it
involve
a
witness?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
it
involve
a...
a
disclosure
by
a
witness
or
by
an...
some
of
the
other
people?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because,
you
know,
i
didn't
realize
it
before,
but
as
i
read
the
statute
one
could
interpret
it
as
not
even
applying
to
witnesses.
if...
it
has
a
list
of
kinds
of
people
who
appear
before
a
grand
jury
and
any
other
similar--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
it
doesn't
really...
and
one
could
read
it
as
just
not
even
imposing
any
prohibition
against
witnesses.
i
know
the
eleventh
circuit
didn't
so
construe
it,
and
we
are
probably
bound
by
that
construction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
been
given
by
the
eleventh
circuit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
no
florida
judge--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
no
florida
judge,
no
state
judges
have
ever
applied
it
to
witnesses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
to
go
back
to
the
question
that
your
opponent
was
asked
at
the
beginning
of
the
argument
about
whether
the
statute
applies
to
the
content
of
testimony
when
the...
when
the
former
witness
doesn't
say
"and
i
so
testified",
but
just
talks.
what
was
the...
i
just
looked
again
at
the
district
court
opinion,
and
he
seems
to
have
read
the
statute
as
prohibiting
disclosure
of
the
content
even
if
there
was
no
reference
to
the
testimony...
the
fact
that
it
was
in
testimony.
was
that
the
way
it
was
construed
in
the
district
court?
because
he
talks
about
it
as
a
severe
infringement
on
rights
under
the
first
amendment,
and
that
is
why
i
read
it
that
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
did
the
state
take
that
position
in
the
district
court,
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
even
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
somewhat
ambiguous
on
that
point.
that's
why
a
number
of
us
asked
that
very
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
there's
a
big
state
interest
in
protecting
the
witness
in
many
cases,
and
lots
of
times
a
witness
isn't
going
to
tell.
and
if
you
put
the
prohibition
on
everybody
else,
that
protects
the
witness.
just
because
the
witness
decides
to
open
the
door
doesn't
mean
you
ought
to
let
everybody
else
open
the
door.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
certainly
it
is,
because
if
the
witness
fears
for
his
life,
he
is
not
going
to
disclose.
and
the
only
way
to
protect
that
is
to
say
nobody
else
can
disclose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
nobody
is
questioning
the
validity
of
the
statute
as
applied
to
grand
jurors,
court
reporters,
stenographers,
everyone
else.
the
only
question
is
whether
a
witness
can
take
this
risk
if
he
wants
to.
