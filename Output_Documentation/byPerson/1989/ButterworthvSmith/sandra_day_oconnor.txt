justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
waas,
i
suppose
that
that
could
be
said
of
federal
investigations
for
violation
of
federal
laws
in
florida.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
federal
rule
on
disclosure
of
grand
jury
testimony
is
not
as
broad
as
you
describe
florida's
as
being,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
indeed,
application
of
the
federal
rule
in
the
state
of
florida
would
not
prohibit
what
mr.
smith
proposes
to
do.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet
the,
the
public
interest
is
the
same.
so
i...
your
argument
is
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
follow.
what
provision
of
the
statute
would
prohibit
the
witness
from
revealing
identities
of
grand
jurors,
for
example,
or
what
the
witness
saw
there,
other
than
testimony
or
evidence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
talking
about
florida's
statute
now.
what
provision
of
your...
i
don't
even
know
what
the
statute
means.
it
doesn't
appear
to
me,
testually,
to
mean
either
what
you
say
it
does
or
what
your
opponent
says
it
does.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
wouldn't
prohibit
disclosure
of
the
identity
of
the
grand
jurors?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
it
isn't
testimony
it
doesn't
prohibit
it.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if...
if
you
regard
those
questions
as
testimony,
i
mean,
that's
your
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
said...
mr.
waas
said
here
this
afternoon
that
the
statute
did
not
prohibit
mr.
smith
from
saying
who
the
identities
of
the
grand
jurors
were
if
he
knew
them.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
didn't
you
hear
his
response
this
afternoon
to
my
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
are
we
arguing
about
here?
the
right
of
your
client
to
disclose
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
him
before
the
grand
jury,
and
that's
all?
no,
and
the
answers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
to
the
extent...
well,
i
thought
mr.
waas
said
that
he
could
reveal,
under
the
statute,
that
he
had
been
called
to
testify
before
the
grand
jury?
