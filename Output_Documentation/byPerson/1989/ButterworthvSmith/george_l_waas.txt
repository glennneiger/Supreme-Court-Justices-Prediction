mr.
george
l.
waas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
florida
believes
that
any
disclosure
of
grand
jury
proceedings
necessarily
compromises
or
breaches
security.
florida
has
made
a
policy
choice
in
recognition
of
this
matter,
a
policy
decision
to
structure
its
criminal
justice
system
in
such
a
way
so
as
to
permanently
bar
witnesses
and
other
participants
in
the
grand
jury
process
from
ever
disclosing
testimony
or
evidence
given
to
the
panel
in
the
absence
of
a
court
order.
although
florida's
choice
differs
from
that
of
the
majority
of
the
other
states,
and
indeed
of
the
federal
government,
this
does
not
mean
that
florida
is
constitutionally
prohibited
from
making
the
policy
choices
that
it
makes--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
eleventh
circuit
found
the
statute
unconstitutional
insofar
as
it
applies
to
a
witness
disclosing
his
own
testimony
after
the
completion
of
an
investigation.
the
difficulty
with
that
decision
is
that
it
conflicts
with
the
recognition
by
this
court
and
others
that
the
interests
justifying
grand
jury
secrecy,
while
reduced
when
an
investigation
is
completed,
are
not
eviscerated.
they
remain
whole
and
viable.
mr.
george
l.
waas
your
honor,
the
interests
are
numerous,
and
they
are
borne
of
those
general
interests
that
are
cited
on
pages
12
and
13
of
our
brief,
as
well
as
by
this
court
in
the
douglas
oil
case,
with
these
specific
additions.
florida
is
a
capital
punishment
state.
there
is
no
statute
of
limitations
with
respect
to
capital
punishment
in
florida.
therefore,
an
investigation
that
is
begun
during
one
term
of
the
grand
jury
and
concluded
during
that
term
may
be
picked
up
months
or
years
later,
based
upon
newly
discovered
evidence.
mr.
george
l.
waas
because
if
a
witness
may
reveal
his
own
testimony,
he
will
be
able
to
also
implicate
the
questions
that
are
asked.
that's
part
of
the
testimony,
the
answers
in
the
abstract
would
not
be
sufficient--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--your
honor,
when
we
talk
about
testimony,
that
word
has
a
certain
common
understanding,
and
that
is
when
you
look
at
a
transcript
of
testimony
what
you
see
are
the
questions
asked
and
the
answers
returned.
you
cannot
siphon
out
the
questions
from
the
answers.
indeed,
if
mr.
smith
here
were
to
have
obtained
a
transcript
of
his
testimony,
it
would
not
have
simply
said
in
the
transcript
that
which
he
was
responding
to.
it
would
include
the
questions
as
well.
mr.
george
l.
waas
your
honor,
the
difficulty
with
that
as
i
see
it
is
that
it
begins
to
enter
into
legislative
determinations.
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
first
amendment,
which
is
the
basis
of
the
eleventh
circuit's
decision
and
the
basis
for
the
claim
made
by
mr.
smith
here,
is
not
susceptible,
necessarily,
to
a
turning
on
or
turning
off
like
a
water
faucet.
the
first
amendment
flows
with
respect
to
participants
and
cannot
be
cut
off
at
the
point
of
limiting
any
disclosure
solely
to
testimonial
matters.
it's
not
so
much
mr.
smith's
testimony
that
is
involved.
it
is
the
testimony
of
grand
jury
witnesses.
mr.
george
l.
waas
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
mr.
george
l.
waas
and
that,
i
believe,
points
out
a
misconception
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
prohibits
mr.
smith
or
any
grand
jury
witness
from
disclosing
the
information
that
that
witness
had
going
into
the
grand
jury
room.
it...
the
statute
doesn't
say
that
he
is
prohibited
from
disclosing
what
he
knew
going
in
or
what
he
knew
coming
out.
he
is
free
to
disclose
the
facts
of
his
investigation.
he
is
free
to
criticize,
to
cajole,
to
condemn
the
grand
jury
system,
its
members,
its
process.
mr.
george
l.
waas
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
george
l.
waas
he
can
disclose
the
fact
that
he
was
called
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
george
l.
waas
no
problem
with
either
one
of
those
questions,
your
honor.
mr.
george
l.
waas
that
is
correct,
for
this
reason.
what
the
statute
addresses
is
what
goes
on
within
the
grand
jury
room.
people
are
free
to
conjecture
as
to
what
the
grand
jury
is
investigating.
but
once
you
identify--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--for
this
reason,
your
honor.
once
you
begin
to
reveal
what
goes
on
within
the
grand
jury
walls,
identity
of
names,
of
potential
witnesses,
of
confidential
informants
are--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--your
honor,
your
hypothetical
may
involve...
in
the
skeletal
posture
of
the
questions
it
is
quite
possible
that
with
respect
to
that
case
there
would
be
no
triggering
of
the
interest.
mr.
george
l.
waas
but,
as
the
cases
which
we
recite
in
our
reply
brief
demonstrate,
the
fact
of
the
absence
of
any
vitality
of
the
interest
justifying
grand
jury
secrecy
in
a
particular
case
doesn't
mean
that
the
interests
don't
exist
to
the
point
of
overcoming
a
first
amendment
claim.
mr.
george
l.
waas
yes,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
as
i
said
earlier--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--yes.
let
us
assume
that
in
the
course
of
his
representation
the
grand
jury
were
to
ask,
with
respect
to
a
confidential
informant
whose
name,
if
disclosed,
would
implicate
that
confidential
informant
to
the
point
of
risking
his
life.
let's
assume
that
happens.
with
respect
to
mr.
smith's
testimony,
he
is
now
free,
as
he
represents
in
his
pleadings
both
below
and
here,
to
not
only
disclose
his
own
testimony,
but
matters
which
he
learns
while
before
the
grand
jury.
and
if
he
is
making
a
first
amendment--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--but,
your
honor,
what
has
happened
in
that
case
is
that
at
that
point,
because
he
has
now
learned
about
another
person's
testimony,
if
he
were
to
reveal
that
he
would
be
knowingly
revealing
grand
jury
testimony.
mr.
george
l.
waas
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
the
difficulty,
though,
is,
as
i
said
earlier,
putting
parameters
around
a
first
amendment
claim.
mr.
george
l.
waas
your
honor,
as
i
understand
it,
with
respect
to
those
cases
involving
the
former
cia
agent
and
those
cases
involving
opportunities
to
engage
in
first
amendment
activities
on
political...
on
military
bases,
this
court
said,
as
i
understand
this,
that
even
though
the
interests
were
not
demonstrated
to
be
viable
in
those
cases,
the
interests
of
protecting
national
security
and
protecting
military
secrets
were
enough
to
overcome
the
first
amendment
claims
in
those
cases,
even
though
those
interests
were
not
real
and
demonstrated
for
those
particular
cases.
mr.
george
l.
waas
your
honor,
i
understand
that,
and
i
am
not
suggesting
that
there
may
not
be
alternative
policy
choices
available.
and
perhaps
a
particular
policy
choice
made
by
a
given
state
may
not
be
the
best
choice.
but
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
first
amendment
right
for
mr.
smith
to
disclose--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--i
understand
that,
and
i
am
just
trying
to
point
out
that
with
respect
to
the
first
amendment
posture
of
the
case,
when
you
are
talking
about
the
vitality
of
those
interests
and
apply
them
to
particularized
efforts
to
disclose
what
has
become
grand
jury
information
by
virtue
of
its
having
been
imparted,
then
the
question
becomes
whether
it
is
more
feasible
for
a
state
to
protect
its
own
interests
by
prohibiting
public
dissemination
or
disclosure
of
that
which
the
grand
jury
is
considering
and
undertaking.
you
see,
once
you
identify
the
fact
of
the
grand
jury's
having
received
certain
information,
then
conjecture
and
speculation
that
is
generally
available
with
respect
to
particularly
media
coverage
of
grand
jury
proceedings
goes
by
the
board.
there
has
to
be
some
way
to
retain
the
vitality
of
grand
jury
proceedings
specifically
when
we
are
dealing
with,
as
is
flcrida's
situation,
a
state
that
is
unique
geographically.
i
am
not
prepared
to
argue
to
this
court
that
the
other
49
states
don't
have
their
own
uniqueness,
they
do.
but
florida's
geography
means
that
the
types
of
issues
that
are
presented
to
a
state
grand
jury
involve
matters
of
international
consideration,
drug
trafficking,--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--that
is
correct.
mr.
george
l.
waas
no,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
george
l.
waas
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
federal
rule
would
permit
witnesses
to
disclose,
upon
leaving
the
grand
jury
room,
unless
a
protective
order
was
entered.
mr.
george
l.
waas
with
respect
to
your...
the
first
question
that
you
asked
with
respect
to
the
federal
rule,
you
are
quite
correct.
but--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--your
honor,
the
statute
prohibits
disclosure
of
testimony
and
evidence
given
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
george
l.
waas
if...
if,
within
the
context
of
questions
asked
by
a
grand
juror,
the
identity
of
the
grand
jurors
is
disclosed,
then,
because
it
is
testimony,
to
that
extent--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--the
statute
itself
does
not
address
identity
of
grand
jurors.
it
does
address
questions
asked
by
the
grand
jurors,
comments
made--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--yes,
your
honor.
yes.
because
it
comprises
the
common
understanding
of
what
constitutes
testimony.
if
mr.
smith,
as
i
said
earlier,
were
to
ask
for
a
copy
of
this
transcript,
he
would
not
only
get
the
answers,
he
would
get
the
questions
and
the
answers
returned
to
those
questions.
mr.
george
l.
waas
quite
possibly.
the...
the
question
with
respect
to
identity
of
grand
jurors
is
not
addressed
in
the
statute.
but
where
the
questions
asked
by
a
grand
juror
and
the
grand
juror
is
identified,
or
by
virtue
of
the
witness
having
knowledge
of
the
grand
juror
from
previous
experiences,
by
coupling
that
information
and
then
going
forth
and
disclosing
that,
you
will
not
only
have
identified
the
grand
juror,
but
the
questions
asked
by
the
grand
juror.
and
the
effect
on
future
grand
jurors
is
demonstrated
by
this
court's
recognition
of
the
interests
justifying
secrecy
set
out
in
the
douglas
oil
cases
and
in
other
cases.
mr.
george
l.
waas
as
i
understand
it,
the
common
law
pertaining
to
grand
juries
did
not
preclude
witnesses
from
testifying.
however,
witnesses
who
were
given
oaths
were
bound
by
their
oaths
of
secrecy.
and
indeed,
in
the
landmark
case,
this
court
in
a
footnote
recognized
that
with
respect
to
participants
an
oath
of
secrecy
can
be
administered
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
the
confidentiality
of
those
proceedings.
and
the
footnote,
footnote
12
of
that
case,
specifically
cites
to
the
florida
judicial
qualifications
commission.
now,
it
is
my
position
that
if
the
state,
or
any
entity
of
the
state
that
conducts
investigations,
may
impose
an
oath
of
secrecy
to
protect
the
internal
security
of
its
operations
and
functions,
then
surely
a
state
can
enact
a
statute
that
serves
the
same
purpose.
this
statute
here
has
the
effect
of
imposing
an
oath
of
secrecy,
and
we
have
by
testimony
the
fact
that--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--that
is
correct.
mr.
george
l.
waas
i
am
not
so
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
george
l.
waas
i
believe
that
any
of
these
kinds
of
statutes,
where
a
particular
type
of
investigation
is
underway,
be
it
a
judicial
qualifications
commission
or
an
ethics
commission
or
an
elections
commission,
and
there
is
an
oath
that
the...
that
the
witness
will
not
divulge
that
which
he
testified
to
before
the
forum,
still
has
the
substance
of
that
information
which
is
free
to
be
disclosed
because
it
comes
from
alternative
sources,
which
this
court
is
most
sensitive
to.
and
the
fact
that
the
alternative
sources
are
those
sources
independent
of
the
grand
jury
or
the
judicial
qualifications
commission
allows
that
person
to
freely
disclose
what
he
or
she
has
gathered,
so
long
as
what
is
not
disclosed
is
the
fact
that
that
information
was
imparted
to
the
governing
body.
mr.
george
l.
waas
your
honor,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
other
secrecy
standard
imposed
other
than
the
one
that
is
indicated
here,
and
that's
that
a
witness
cannot
disclose
what
he
tells
the
grand
jury.
mr.
george
l.
waas
under
common
law
a
witness
was
free
to
disclose.
there
was
no
prohibition.
but
i
believe
that
there
was
an
oath
of
secrecy
that
operated
to
that
effect.
mr.
george
l.
waas
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
would
be
imposed
in
all
instances.
but
there
was
no
regulation
in
effect.
mr.
george
l.
waas
the
oaths
of
secrecy?
mr.
george
l.
waas
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure,
but
i
do
know
that
the
oaths
now
don't
have
a
time
frame
established.
and
that's
because
investigations
do
carry
forth.
they
don't
necessarily--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
george
l.
waas
no,
your
honor.
and
again,
that
goes
to
my
response
earlier.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
precludes
mr.
smith
or
any
witness
from
disclosing
the
knowledge
that
he
had
going
into
the
grand
jury
room.
he
is
free
to
unearth
and
disclose
corruption,
government
misconduct--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--that,
and
the
interests
that
surround
grand
jury
secrecy
generally.
mr.
george
l.
waas
your
honor,
the
problem
with
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--yes.
mr.
george
l.
waas
it...
it
forbids
the
state
from
being
able
to
assure,
on
a
continuing
permanent
basis,
that
what
is
disclosed
by
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury
remain
before
the
grand
jury.
it's...
it's
the
opening
the
door
to
the
grand
jury
room.
mr.
george
l.
waas
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
l.
waas
when
the
information
that
is
imparted
contains
names
of
persons
who
may
be
proven
innocent,
that
is
subject
to
disclosure
before
the
grand
jury
now.
so
the
prospect
of
not
being
able
to
protect
the
innocent
accused
is
vitalized.
mr.
george
l.
waas
but
if
it's
disclosed
to
the
grand
jury
it
identifies
potential
targets,
it
identifies
potential
witnesses
that...
whose
identity
may
not
have
been
previously
disclosed.
you
see,
once...
the
substance
of
the
information
may
be
published,
and
the
fact
that
a
person
testifies
before
a
grand
jury
may
be
published.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
at
that
point
the
grand
jury
is
in
possession
of
information
which
operates
to
target
potential
defendants,
identify
potential
informants,
identify
existing
informants,
subject
the
grand
jurors
to
the
type
of
scrutiny
with
respect
to
their
questions.
all
of
these
interests
begin
to
ripple
out
once
the
door
to
the
grand
jury
room
is
opened.
mr.
george
l.
waas
your
honor,
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
takes
away
that
which
is
available
under
the
rule...
under
the
federal
rule
upon
which
mr.
smith
seeks
to
model
florida's
law,
and
that
is
the
ability
to
impose
any
kind
of
post-testimony
protective
order.
the
eleventh
circuit
doesn't
address
that.
it
says
when
the
investigation
ends.
it
doesn't
say
when
the
investigation
ends.
it
doesn't
take
into
account
that
investigations
carry
over
months,
even
years,
beyond
the
term
of
court.
see,
that's
really
the
problem
with
the
eleventh
circuit
opinion.
it
tends
to
decompartmentalize
grand
jury
proceedings.
and
we
are
suggesting,
and
our
witnesses
demonstrate,
that
grand
jury
proceedings
are
not
decompartmentalized
or
compartmentalized,
but
flow
from
term
to
term
to
term.
and
if
at
the
end
of
a
grand
jury
investigation
a
prosecuting
attorney
announces
that
this
investigation
is
over
and
the
witness
goes
forth
and
holds
a
press
conference,
and
the
next
witness
comes
in
and,
by
virtue
of
that
witness'
disclosures,
the
prosecuting
attorney
or
the
grand
jury
change
their
mind
and
want
the
investigation
to
proceed
further,
the
cat
could
be
out
of
the
bag.
and
these
interests
are
not
interests
that
are
speculative,
because
our
experience
and
our
knowledge
teach
us
that
if
certain
events
occur,
certain
consequences
are
going
to
follow.
and
that's
why
i
believe
that
the
appropriate
test
is
the
one
enunciated
in
seattle
times,
as
embellished
in
the
albertini
case.
and
that
is,
whether
the
regulation
furthers
important
or
significant
government
interest
which
will
be
achieved--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--less
effectively
absent
the
regulation.
mr.
george
l.
waas
i
am
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor.
mr.
george
l.
waas
i
believe
there
has
been...
there
is
one
case
cited
in
our
reply
brief
which
addresses
what
this
statute
means.
and
it
says--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--excuse
me?
mr.
george
l.
waas
i
believe
it
was
in
a...
in
a
generalized
discussion.
i
don't
believe
it
involved--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--or
any
other
person,
i
believe
it
says.
mr.
george
l.
waas
yes,
your
honor.
the
interpretation
that
has
been
given
is
that
any
other
person
means
witnesses.
mr.
george
l.
waas
that
is
correct.
mr.
george
l.
waas
and
the
district
court
as
well.
mr.
george
l.
waas
no,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
florida
courts
applying
it.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
george
l.
waas
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
appears
from
the
argument
pressed
by
mr.
smith
that
there
are
now
categories
of
participants,
and
depending
upon
the
categorization
of
participants,
different
rights
ought
to
flow.
i
don't
read
landmark,
particularly
the
commentary
in
one
of
the
early
footnotes
that
specifically
identify
witnesses
as
participants,
as
creating
a
classification
of
participants
separate
and
apart
from
the
others.
in
fact,
without
witnesses,
i
dare
say
the
other
participants
in
the
grand
jury
process
would
have
little
if
anything
to
do.
witnesses
lie
at
the
heart
of
the
grand
jury
process.
and
i
don't
believe
that
there
ought
to
be
a
categorization
of
witnesses,
either
witnesses
from
other
participants
or
a
distinction
between
subpoenaed
witnesses
and
voluntarily
appearing
witnesses.
with
respect
to
the
federal
system,
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
even
though
the
federal
government
has
made
a
particular
policy
choice,
that
doesn't
mean
that
that
represents
the
most
effective
choice
as
viewed
from
other
or
by
other
jurisdictions.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
establishes
that
the
choices
made
by
the
other
states
and
the
one
made
by
the
federal
government
are
more
effective
or
as
effective
than
the
choice
made
by
the
state
of
florida.
with
respect
to
the
identification
of
testimony,
once
it
is
identified
as
to
what
testimony
is
revealed
before
the
grand
jury,
we
at
that
point
know
what
the
specifics
of
the
investigation
undertaken
by
the
grand
jury
are.
it's
no
longer
subject
to
conjecture
or
speculation.
it
is
subject
now
to
public
knowledge.
and
the
effect
of
that,
the
state
of
florida
has
determined,
weighs
more
heavily
with
respect
to
preserving
the
interest
of
the
criminal
justice
system
than
any
putative
first
amendment
claim
may
weigh
with
respect
to
mr.
smith
and
other
witnesses.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--yes,
your
honor,
that's
my
point.
that's
my
point.
and
that
is
once
the
door
is
open
on
a
first
amendment
ground--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--that
may
be
true,
except
that
in
the
first
amendment
context
it
is
not
so
much
who
is
doing
the
disclosure,
but
what
is
disclosed.
that's--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--that
is
correct.
but
if
that
witness'
name
happens
to
be
uttered
by
a
member
of
the
grand
jury,
and
the
reporter
witness--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--that's
correct.
that's
the
issue
here.
mr.
george
l.
waas
if,
five
years
later,
he
is
called
to
testify,
he
would
not
be
able
to
disclose
the
fact
that
he
testified
before
the
grand
jury
with
respect
to
the
testimony
that
he
imparts
to
the
grand
jury.
mr.
george
l.
waas
well,
your
honor,
if
you're
looking
at
a
time
constraint--
mr.
george
l.
waas
--thank
you,
your
honor.
