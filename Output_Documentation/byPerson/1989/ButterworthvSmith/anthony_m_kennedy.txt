justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
the
state
could
just
say
juror
number
1,
juror
number
2.
i
mean,
the
grand
jurors
don't
usually
say
good
afternoon,
my
name
is
so
and
so.
they
don't
say
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
wasn't
it
imposed
just
for
the
life
of
the
grand
jury?
was
it
imposed
just
for
the
life
of
the
grand
jury
or
forever
and
ever?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
certainly
it
didn't
survive
trial,
did
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
statute,
as
i
understand
it,
is
in
perpetuity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
with
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
was
given
to
us
by
the
petitioners'
attorney,
that
you...
a
witness
can
disclose
the
substance
of
his
testimony,
not
by
reference
to
the
fact
that
it's
testimony,
but
he
can
tell
everything
that
he
knows
independently
by
the
transaction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
has
it,
has
the
state
ever
argued
to
the
contrary
before
a
florida
state
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
state
has?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
grand
jurors
be
forbidden
from
disclosing
the
testimony?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
your
same
hypothetical.
somebody
else
on
the
jury
says
we
heard
this
testimony
and
they
didn't
indict
because
the
foreman
was
a
cousin
of
the
witness.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
same
horrible
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
doesn't
that
make
it
all
the
more
credible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
restrict
the
most
credible
speech
and
not
the
least
credible
speech?
i
thought
it
was
the
opposite.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we're
quibbling
about
the
hypothetical.
i
still
am
not
sure
why
it
is
that
you
draw
the
line
between
the
grand
juror
and
the
witness.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
you
had
three
witnesses,
they
could
all
testify,
but
not
the
grand
juror?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
state's
interest
in
preventing
targets
from
becoming
fugitives
substantially
satisfied
because
in
many
cases
they
make
the
arrest
before
the
indictment,
before
the
grand
jury
proceeding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
any
indication
that
that
oath
survived
the
term
of
the
grand
jury?
