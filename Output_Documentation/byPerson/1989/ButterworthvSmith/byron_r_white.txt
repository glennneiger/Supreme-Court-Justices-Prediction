justice
byron
r.
white
isn't...
wasn't
your
policy
overturned
solely
with
respect
to
a
witness
disclosing
his
own
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
which...
which,
as
applied
to
a
witness
revealing
his
own
testimony,
what
is
the
state's
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
why
prevent
a
witness
from
revealing
his
own
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
you
can't
say
that
you
are
really
trying
to
protect
the
life
of
the...
of
this
fellow
who
wants
to
reveal
his
own
testimony.
if
he
wants
to
protect
himself
he
can
by
being
quiet.
but
i
suppose
that
if
he
is
asked
in
the
grand
jury
room
and
he
testifies
to
a
certain
fact,
and
he
is
asked
well,
where
did
you...
how
do
you
know
this?
then
he
says
john
jones
told
me.
now,
he
is
then
identifying
some
other
people
that
know
maybe
some
critical
facts
that
some
other
people
wouldn't
like
him
to
testify
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
was
trying
to
give
you...
i
was
trying
to
give
you
an
example
where
your...
that
would
defend
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you...
don't
you
agree
that,
or
do
you,
that
your
client
wants
to
reveal
not
only
his
testimony
but
the
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
a
reporter...
your
client
is
a
reporter?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
gives
his
testimony
and
he...
the
grand
jury...
the
state
wants
to
know
where
he
got
his
information.
he
says
well,
i
have
confidential
informants.
and
the
issue
is
government
corruption.
and
he
has
information
that
he
believes,
he
has
used
this
informant
in
the
past
and
he
is
found
to
be
reliable,
but
he
won't...
say
who
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
just
want
to
know
what
your...
do
you
think
the
state
has
an
interest
then
in
not
having
him
reveal
his
testimony?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
make
a
distinction
between
the
reporter
and
the...
any
other
citizen,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
your
reporter
finds...
knows
that
there
was
a
witness
who
testified
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
talks
to
him,
the
witness
should
be
able
to
tell
the
reporter
that,
without
violating
this
statute
you
think,
that
yes,
i
testified
and
here
is
what
i
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
then
that
you
wouldn't
object
to
preventing
your
client
from
publishing
this
story
while
the
grand
jury
was
still
in
session?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
your
position?
do
you
have
a
position
on
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about...
what's
your
position
about
your
client
publishing
what
he
learned
before
the
grand
jury,
if
he
did
learn
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
can...
after...
i
take
it
that
you
would
say
that
even
during...
when
the
grand
jury
is
still
in
session,
if
he
knows
who
a
witness
is
or
has
been
before
the
grand
jury,
he
can
talk
to
that
witness
and
that
witness,
as
you
say,
is
free
to,
you
think,
to
talk
during...
and
so
your
client
learns
that
testimony
and
he
publishes
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
either
during
the
grand
jury
or
after
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
witness
might
be
able
to
do
that,
but
you
wouldn't
contend
that
the
prosecutor--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
the
reporter.
