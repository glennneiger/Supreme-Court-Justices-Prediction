justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waas,
suppose...
suppose
the
witness
does
not
preface
his
disclosure
with
this
is
what
i
testified
to.
he
just...
he
just
tells
somebody
or
he
prints
in
a
newspaper
story
the
very
same
thing
which
he
knew,
which
he
happened
to
testify
to
before
the
grand
jury.
so
there
is
no
indication
on
the
face
of
it
that
that
is
what
he
said.
does
that
violate
your
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waas,
what
was
the
rule
about
grand
jury
secrecy
at
the
time
the
first
amendment
was
adopted?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it
doesn't.
but
it
doesn't.
that
oath
of
secrecy
you
are
talking
about
referred
to
in
the
footnote--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
meant
you
would
not
disclose
that
information
to
anybody,
didn't
it?
that
just
didn't
mean
you
would
not
go
up
to
somebody
and
say
not
only
is
this
the
fact,
but
i
testified
to
it.
didn't
that
oath
mean
you
couldn't
go
out
and
tell
people
that
same
information?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
how
i
interpret
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
was
no
general
prohibition.
i
mean,
that's
a
case-by-case
determination
by
the
grand
jury,
that
secrecy
is
needful
in
this
particular
case.
was
it
ever
the
practice
to
have
simply
an
across-the-board
rule
of
secrecy,
such
as
you
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
asking
was
that
the
situation
at
common
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
would
always
be
imposed,
or
which
was
imposed
case
by
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
i
thought
we
just
went
over
that.
i...
i
thought
that
he
could
have
disclosed
whatever
he
wanted
to
disclose,
except
the
fact
that
he
disclosed
it
to
the
grand
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
what
this
whole
fight
is
about.
your
client
wants
to
be
able
to
say
not
only
is
all
this
true,
but
i
told
it
to
the
grand
jury.
that...
that's
what
has
brought
you
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
he
learned
from
the
questions
that
people
asked
him?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
a
minute.
was
that
a
yes...
excuse
me.
was
that
a
yes
to
that
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
agree
with
that
interpretation
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
rules
of
court
governing
what
our
law
clerks
can
generally
disclose,
and
it's
darn
little.
and
there
are,
i
suppose,
professional
sanctions
that
might
be
imposed
should
a
law
clerk
violate
the
confidence
of
the
court.
now,
i
can't
really
say
that
every
single
item
of
information
that
that
general
policy
of
confidentiality
covers
would
harm
the
court
if
it
were
disclosed,
but
we
have
a
general
rule.
now,
i'm
sure
that
nothing
very
significant
is
withheld
by
that,
but
is
it
your
contention
that
we
would
have
to
justify
case
by
case
every
instance
in
which
a
law
clerk
is
prohibited
from
disclosing
the
confidential
doings
of
the
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
so
you
would
extend
the
same
rule
to
here,
then,
i
gather,
that
each
individual
restriction
has
to
be
justified.
we
just
can't
have
a
general
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
better
be
very
careful
then.
i...
i
see
this
case
in
a
new
light.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
confidential
advice
to
the
president?
suppose
congress
wants
to
find
out
what
one
of
the
president's
closest
advisors
counseled
him?
i
thought
there
was
a
privilege
for
that.
does
that
privilege
have
to
be
examined
item
of
information
by
item
of
information,
or
can
you
just
say
it's
all
privileged,
similar
to
what
florida
has
done
with
the
grand
jury
testimony?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
that
the
interest
may
be
different,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
we're
constrained
by
our
first
amendment
law
to
apply
a
piece-by-piece
approach
as
you
are
urging
upon
us.
that
if...
if
the
state
cannot
demonstrate
that
this
particular
item
of
information
would
damage
the
grand
jury,
then
that
is
no
good.
and
then
we
move
on
to
the
next
piece
of
information.
if
that
wouldn't
damage
the
grand
jury
then
that
is
no
good.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
possible
to
have
a
reasonable
general
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
waas,
what
did
it
mean
in
1791,
or
do
you
know
what
the
common
law
was?
do
you
agree
with...
i'm
sorry,
mr.
thomas.
do
you
agree
with
mr.
waas
as
to
what
the
situation
was
at
common
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is,
you
could...
you
could
disclose
everything
unless
you
were
put
under
oath?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
if
we
said
that
the
witness
can
say
that
he
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
and
he
said
thus
and
so,
there
would
be
very
little
reason
for
florida
to
prohibit
anybody
else
from
saying
that
he
appeared
before
the
grand
jury
and
said
thus
and
so.
i
mean,
the
rest
of
section
905.27
wouldn't
make
must
sense.
it
says
a
grand
juror,
state
attorney,
nobody
else
can
disclose
the
testimony.
but
if
you
let
the
witness
himself
go
out
and
say
this
is
what
i
testified,
why
should
you
prevent
anybody
else
from--
