that
was
an
express
assignment
of
the
right
to
renew?
justice
white
and
if
the
author
hadn't
died,
could
the
assignee
have
exercised
that
right
or
would
the
author
have
had
to
do
so?
justice
white
so
this
case
would
be
the
same,
in
your
view,
if
he
had...
never
had
assigned
the
renewal
right?
justice
white
well,
even
if
he
had
assigned
it,
you
couldn't
exercise
it.
justice
white
well,
what
if
he
didn't
renew
it?
justice
white
xxx
even
if
he
assigned...
even
though
he
had
assigned,
if
he
had
lived,
could
you
have
forced
him
to
renew?
justice
white
and
you
couldn't
force
his
statutory
successor
to
renew...
i
mean,
his
executor?
justice
white
well,
you
couldn't
do
it,
could
you?
justice
white
an
assignee
could
have
gone
in
and--
justice
white
--so
even
if...
so
he
could
not
have
even...
if
he'd
of
lived
he
couldn't
have
prevented
you
from
renewing
it
in
his
name?
justice
white
what
do
you
mean
no?
he
couldn't?
justice
white
well,
he's
just
contrary.
justice
white
if
the
copyright
holder
who
made
the
assignment
had
renewed,
you
say
that
he
could
not
interfere
with
your
plan,
if
he
had
lived?
justice
white
is
that...
do
you
derive
that
directly
from
the
act
or
is
that
a
judicial--
justice
white
--well,
i
know.
but
that's
just
a...
the
assignment
does
not
expire.
is
that
just
a
judicial
decision?
justice
white
and
that
assignment
is
an
assignment?
justice
white
well,
what
about
our
later
decision...
which
one
is
it...
miller?
justice
white
and
it...
what
if
assignment
isn't
an
assignment;
it's
just
an
expectancy?
justice
white
what
if
he
assigned
to
what...
in
that
case,
what
did
he
assign?
justice
white
including
the
renewal?
justice
white
to
the
publisher?
justice
white
but
who...
all
he
had
was
the
assignment.
he
didn't
have
a...
he
didn't
have
another
copyright
[inaudible].
justice
white
to
get
a
copyright
on
rear
window,
did
all
you
have
to
do
is
just
make
the
film
and
present
it
for
a
copyright?
justice
white
and
do
you
have
to
demonstrate
that...
in
getting
your
copyright
that
you
have
those
permissions?
justice
white
the
copyright
office
doesn't
really
care
about
that
at
all.
justice
white
do
you
agree
that
if
the
author
had
lived
and
refused
to
renew,
that
the
copyright
could
have
been
renewed
in
his
name?
justice
white
and
how
about
if
he
dies
and
the
executor
refuses
to
renew?
do
you
think
he
could
be...
then
you
could
renew
in
the
author's
name?
justice
white
no.
no
privity
of
contract.
he's
just
an
executor.
justice
white
because
it's
already
the...
the
renewal
assignment
is
already
a
dead
letter,
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
at
least
the
executor
isn't
bound
by
it.
justice
white
but
the
renewal
is...
it
just
expired.
the
renewal
assignment
just
expires,
i
guess,
with
the
death,
is
that
right?
justice
white
well,
it
must
not
mean
anything
unless
you
could
go
ahead
and
renew
in
the
author's
name
unless,
if
the
executor
refused.
but
you
say
you
couldn't.
justice
white
well,
didn't
it
even...
the
dissent
in
miller
agree
that
a
widow
and
children
would
take
precedence
over
the
assignee
of
the
renewal
term?
justice
white
and
that
was
the
dissent's
point?
justice
white
but
is
that
still
the
case,
that
widows
and
children
are
especially
protected?
justice
white
so
assignees
have
always
had
the
risk
of
being
upstaged
by
a
widower
or
children?
justice
white
xxx
the
office
created
by
statute?
justice
white
what
is
he
supposed...
what
is
he
supposed
to
know
about
the
substantive
meaning
of
the
copyright
act?
justice
white
he
isn't
entitled
to
issue
regulations
about
what
the
statute
means,
does
he?
