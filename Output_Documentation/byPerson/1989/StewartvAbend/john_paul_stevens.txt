justice
stevens
but
he
could
use
any
of
the
new
matter
that
was
incorporated
in
the
hitchcock
movie?
justice
stevens
no.
he'd
have
to
make
an
entirely
new
motion
picture
of
that.
justice
stevens
and
he
couldn't
infringe
those
additions
to
the
story?
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
a
question
here?
justice
stevens
supposing...
instead
of
giving
a
right
to
just
the
derivative
work
of
motion
pictures
there
had
been
an
assignment
of
all
rights
in
the
copyright.
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument?
justice
stevens
so
you
relied
primarily
on
the
fact
that
you
did
create
a
new
work
before
the
first
copyright
term
expired?
justice
stevens
well,
then,
if
that's
the
case,
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
you've
got
a
copyright
on
the
derivative
work?
justice
stevens
i
know
you
couldn't
get
it.
but
in
order
to
maintain
your
position
today,
supposing
you
had
not
copyrighted
the
derivative
work.
would
your
right
to
use
what
was
given
to
you
survive?
justice
stevens
but
the
right
the
copyright
gives
you
is
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
your
new
matter,
and
you
still
have
that
right.
justice
stevens
but
i'm
suggesting
that
normally
you
can
either
use
it
or
not
use
it
at
your
will,
as
long
as
nobody
can
interfere
with
your
right.
but
your
right
to
exclude
others
doesn't
necessarily
carry
with
it
a
right
to
use
it
yourself
is
what
i'm
saying.
justice
stevens
but
you
still
have...
i
think
justice
stevens
was
saying
you
still
have
the
value
of
that
new
copyright
that's
come
into
existence.
let's
suppose
that
the
original
short-story
writer
or
his
successors
want
to
do
a
remake
of
the
movie,
rear
window.
they'd
have
to
come
to
you
and
pay
you
in
order
to
do
that
remake.
justice
stevens
mr.
anderson,
can
i
interrupt
you
for
a
second?
justice
stevens
you're...
it's
true,
i
suppose
that...
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
i'm
concerned
about
the
effect
of
your
rule
on
the
author's
ability
to
make
a
favorable
marketing
of
his
creative
work
when
his
lifetime
is...
one
doesn't
know
how
long
he's
going
to
live.
say
five
years
before
the
expiration
of
the
first
patent
the
motion
picture
company
says:
we
want
to
spend
$100
million
making
this
gigantic
epic
with
your
story.
is
there
some
way
you
can
guarantee
that
we
can
have
more
than
five
years
in
which
to
recoup
our
investment?
you'd
have
to
say
no,
wouldn't
you?
justice
stevens
well,
say
it's
done,
you
know,
just
the
year
before
the
27th
year.
justice
stevens
well,
of
course,
they
made
it
at
a
time
when
they
thought
the
rohauer
rule
was
the
right
rule.
justice
stevens
i
suppose
the
other
side
of
this
is
that
maybe
these
all
did
turn
out
well,
but
there's
also
been
some
motion
picture
companies
that
have
gone
bankrupt
over
the
years.
justice
stevens
for
this
reason.
but
you
also
don't
know
how
many
deals
might
have
been
turned
down
because
of
this
concern.
the
fact
that
they
made
some
transactions
doesn't
mean
that
there
weren't
some
that
were
turned
down
for...
because
of...
because
it's
certainly
an
obvious
risk
of
some
importance.
justice
stevens
mr.
anderson,
before
you
get
into
all
those
other
works,
do
you
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
on
remedy,
that
you
have
no
right
to
an
injunction?
justice
stevens
i'm
very
interested
in
whether
you
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit's
view.
justice
stevens
you
do
not
agree.
justice
stevens
you
don't
think
the
remedy
is
limited
to
just
some
kind
of
statutory
damages
or
royalties?
you
think
you
could
actually
enjoin
the
production
to--
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
that.
that's
how
you
include
the
videotapes,
because
you
said
he
has
the
right
to--
justice
stevens
--but
what
if...
what
if
he
hadn't
produced
anything?
you
had
the
right
to
produce
a
lot
of
things
by
the
original
range
of
things.
justice
stevens
well,
then,
why
can
you
produce
videotapes?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
the
point.
they
are
a
copy.
