mr.
louis
p.
petrich
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
for
copyright
infringement
requires
the
court
to
reconcile
a
conflict
between
two
competing
copyrights
conferred
under
the
same
section,
section
24,
of
the
1909
copyright
act.
on
the
same
essential
facts
of
this
case,
both
the
second
and
the
ninth
circuits
have
reached
very
different
accommodations
of
these
interests.
in
this
case,
in
1942,
a
short
story
named,
or
entitled
rear
window,
was
first
written
and
copyrighted
by
cornell
woolrich
in
1942.
in
1953,
the
actor
jimmy
stewart
and
the
director,
alfred
hitchcock,
teamed
up
to
form
a
production
company
to
make
a
motion
picture
based
in
part
on
that
short
story.
they
obtained
a
prior
assignment
from
the
author
of
the
short
story,
which
gave
them
the
right
to
make
all
motion
picture
versions
of
the
short
story,
and
to
continue
to
exhibit
those
motion
picture
versions
throughout
the
life
of
the
original
or
initial
term
of
copyright
obtained
by
the
short
story
author,
as
well
as
any
renewal
term
of
that
author.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
yes,
your
honor.
it's
reproduced
in
the--
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
--it
has
always
been
the
law
that
only
the
statutory
successor
named
in
the
statute
may
exercise
the
right.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
no.
if
he
had
not
assigned
the
renewal
right,
we
would
not
claim
that
we
had
a
right
to
use
the
work
during
his
renewal
term.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
we
could
not
renew.
the
law
provides
that
only
the
people
named
in
the
statute
may
actually
renew
it.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
well,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
if
he
did
not
renew
it,
the
underlying
story
would
have
gone
into
the
public
domain
and
anyone
could
use
the
story.
in
1954,
the
film
company
created
a
motion
picture
based
on
the
story,
adding
new
characters,
new
incidents
and
new
dialogue.
that
motion
picture
was
separately
copyrighted
under
section
7
of
the
1909
act.
in
1968,
the
author
of
the
short
story
died
and
his
copyright
was
renewed
the
following
year
by
his
executor
and
became
effective
in
1970.
in
1982,
the
owners
of
the
film
copyright
renewed
their
copyright
under
section...
the
same
section
24.
and
now
jimmy
stewart
and
alfred
hitchcock's
estate
own
90
percent
of
the
film
copyright.
in
1983,
relying
on
a
decision
of
the
second
circuit,
the
film
was
re-released
as
a
part
of
a
five-film
retrospective
of
alfred
hitchcock
films,
many
of
which
included
the
talents
of
jimmy
stewart.
mr.
abend,
the
respondent
here,
in
the
meantime,
had
acquired
rights
from
the
executor
of
the
short
story
author
and
he
brought
this
claim,
contending
that
the
death
of
the
author
before
renewal,
as
well
as
the
renewal
by
the
executor,
operated
as
a
matter
of
copyright
law
and
policy
to
terminate
any
rights
that
the
films
owners
had
to
continue
using
their
film.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
well,
he's
listed
as
a
literary
researcher.
he
has
testified
that
he
buys
these
rights
for
himself
and
for
clients.
the
district
court,
in
this
case,
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
defendants,
relying
upon
the
1977
decision
of
judge
friendly
in
the
rohauer
case,
which
judge
friendly
described
as
a
case
of
first
impression
on
this
issue.
a
ninth
circuit
panel,
by
a
split
decision,
reversed
the
district
court's
summary
judgment
in
this
case,
and
so
we
are
here.
both
circuits,
however,
it's
important
to
note,
acknowledge
that
a
reconciliation
of
these
competing
copyrights
was
required.
i
will
plan
to
explain
why
the
second
circuit's
accommodation
of
these
competing
interests
best
resolves
the
competing
copyright
interests
and
policies,
and
why
the
ninth
circuit's
accommodation
in
this
case
was
flawed
and
will
result
in
a
defeating
of
the
policies
and
purposes
of
the
copyright
act.
under
the
second
circuit's
approach
as
to
the
prior
work...
when
the
prior
author
dies
and
his
statutory
successor
renews
the
copyright,
the
court
would
effect
the
second-chance
policy
of
section
24
in
favor
of
authors
by
providing
that
all
of
the
rights
given
to
the
derivative
work
owner
lapse
or
revert
and
go
back
to
the
statutory
successor
of
the
prior
work,
with
one
important
exception.
the
owner
of
the
derivative
work
would
continue
to
have
the
right
to
exploit
that
derivative
work
which
was
made
under
license
during
the
first
term
and
authorized
by
section
7
and
would
only
be
able
to
continue
to
exploit
that
work
according
to
the
limits
placed
on
him
or
her
by
that
original
assignment.
this
effecting
of
the
policy
actually
gives
the
statutory
successor
even
more
than
what
the
author
would
have
had
had
he
survived
and
renewed
because,
under
the
decision
of
this
court
in
fred
fisher,
if
the
author
had
lived
three
more
months
and
had
renewed
the
copyright
in
this
case,
as
the
assignment
that
he
previously
had
given,
would
have
given
the
movie
owners
the
rights
to
continue
to
distribute
the
movie
but,
more
importantly,
to
make
additional
motion
pictures.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
we
could
not
force
him
to
renew.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
no.
but
there
was
a
policy
under
the
copyright
that
the
copyright
office
had:
that
others
could
go
in
and
renew
in
the
name
of
the
statutory
successor.
but
you
had
to
be
careful
to
be
sure
that
you
renewed
in
the
name
of
the
author
if
he
was
alive.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
i
think
we
could.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
yes,
we
could.
we
would
have
had
a
power
of
attorney
to
do
so.
in
fact,
some
courts
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
power
of
attorney
was
even
implied
by
the
prior
assignment.
but
the
renewal
had
to
be
in
the
name
of
that
statutory
successor
or
the
author
if--
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
--no.
no,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
he
could
not
have
prevented
us
from
renewing.
and
of
course,
why
would
he
because
he
would
lose
all
of
the
other
rights
he
would
have
under
the
contract.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
well,
that
could
happen.
now,
as
to
derivative
work,
the
second
circuit
came
to
a
conclusion
that
the
court
would
effect
the
section
7
and
24
rights
granted
to
the
derivative
works
authors
by
allowing
them
simply
to
continue
to
use
that
work
which
they
had
created
under
license
during
the
first
term.
but
it's
important
to
note
that
there
were
limitations.
this
was
only
applicable
in
a
case
where
the
derivative
work
had
been
made
under
license
and
had
been
made
during
the
first
term
of
the
prior
work's
author.
secondly,
they
would
lose
the
right
to
exercise
any
other
rights
under
the
assignment,
such
as
rights
of
exclusivity
to
prevent
others
from
making
motion
pictures,
and
they
would
also
lose
the
right
to
make
additional
motion
pictures
of
their
own
into
the
second
term.
and
finally,
they
would
remain
subject
to
all
of
the
specific
limitations
that
were
placed
upon
them
in
the
original
assignment.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
could
i
have
that
again?
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
right.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
absolutely.
he's
the
only
one
in
the
world
who
could
make
new
movies
based
on
that
short
story
now.
he
has
all
of
those
rights.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
no,
your
honor.
because
that
is
still
subject
to
copyright--
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
--well,
that--
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
now,
he's
the
entire
owner.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
--the
problem
is
that
only
a
part
of
the
short
story
was
used
in
the
film.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
right.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
he
could
make
a
literal
version
of
the
short
story
and
have
no
problem
from
us.
there's
nothing
we
could
do
about
it.
our
short...
our
film
is
a
revision
or
an
augmentation
of
his
short
story.
we've
added
the
grace
kelly
character
and
the
thelma
ritter
character
in
the
film--
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
--he
could
not
use
the
new
matter
that
was
added
by
us.
that's
under
rohauer,
which
is
the
second
circuit
decision.
any
payments
that
might
be
due
under
the
assignment,
any
screen
credits
that
might
be
due
under
the
assignment
would
all
still
have
to
be
made
to
the
statutory
successor.
and
as
i
have
said,
any
limitations,
such
as
limitations
on
the
territories
or
the
time
in
which
the
film
can
be
shown...
they
would
still
be
binding.
and
in
fact
this
would
be
the
same...
the
derivative
work
owner
in
that
case
would
be
in
the
same
place
as
a
derivative
work
owner
would
be
today
under
the
1976
act,
if
someone
had
exercised
the
statutory
termination
right
and
the
statutory
exception
would
come
into
play.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
well,
professor
nimmer
hasn't
liked
it,
but
he
also
was
counsel
for
the
writers
guild
at
one
time.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
correct.
that
the
writers
guild
had...
i'm
sorry.
the
copyright
registrar
has,
although
the
registrar
has
also
said
that
this
is
a
matter
which
is
confusing
and
needs
some
clarification,
which
is
our
position.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
that's
not
altogether
clear,
your
honor,
because
there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that...
or
the
legislative
history,
that
show
that
the
1909
act
intended
to
discriminate
in
favor
of
one
set
of
authors
against
another
set
of
authors.
in
fact,
the
record
only
shows
that
there
was
a
debate
about
whether
derivative
works
ought
to
be...
ought
to
have
a
shorter
term
and
expire
at
the
time
of
the
underlying
author's
term.
and
that
was
given
up,
and
instead,
all
the
copyrights,
derivative
or
otherwise,
were
given
the
same
term.
and
their
rights
all
derive
under
section
24.
they
both
are
given
two
terms
of
28
years.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
if
he
had
lived,
he
would
have
or
we
would
have
had
the
assignment
he
had
given
us,
which
would
give
us
the
assigned
right
to
make--
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
--oh,
no.
no.
that
was
from
the
assignment
itself.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
that...
that's
based
on
the
decision
of
this
court
in
1943,
the
fred
fisher
case.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
so
that
congress
intended
for
authors
to
have
the
right
to
assign
their
interests,
including
their
renewal
interest.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
miller
music.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
in
miller
music,
where
you
had
a
competition
between
an
author
on
one
side
and
a
mere
publisher
on
the
other,
it
said
that
the
clear
intent
of
congress
was
that
the
author's
successors...
in
this
case
the
author
is
dead...
the
author's
successors
ought
to
get
the
new
renewal
and
they
ought
to
get
the
renewal
term
of
the--
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
--apparently,
the
entire
term,
all
the
copyrights--
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
--including
the
renewal.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
that's
right.
the
difference
we
say
is
that,
in
this
case,
we
don't
have
author
versus
user.
we
have
author
versus
author.
congress
intended
for
all
of
the
authors
to
be
able
to
exercise
their
rights
under
section
24
and
gave
all
authors,
equally,
two
terms.
and
gave
all
authors
that
same
second
chance.
and
they
had
to
know
that
if
they
were
going
to
have
overlapping
copyrights
because
there
were
going
to
be
works
that
were
derivative
of
other
existing
work,
that
there
were
going
to
be
overlaps.
and
they
made
no
provision
at
all...
no
specific
provision
at
all
to
say
that
they
wanted
some
sort
of
a
reversion
that
would
prevent
the
copyright
holder
in
the
derivative-work
situation
to
have
a
shorter
term
of
enjoyment
of
his
copyright.
in
this
case,
if
mr.
abend
was
right,
that
the
copyright
and
the
film
would
have
run
from
1954
to
1970,
and
that
he
couldn't...
then
the
movie...
hitchcock
and
stewart
couldn't
use
it.
and
they
couldn't
use
it
for
another
28
years,
and
perhaps--
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
--well,
the
ninth
circuit
expressed
the
view
that,
while
they
understood
that
there
were
important
policy
reasons
for
reconciling
these
conflicting
interests,
they
chose
not
to
bring
those
policy
interests
into
play
until
the
remedies
portion
of
the
analysis.
and
we
think
that's
where
they
made
the...
the
very
grave
mistake.
they
started
their
reconciliation
at
the...
after
they
decided
that
they
would
favor
one
set
of
authors
over
another
set
of
authors
and
hold
that
the
work
was
an
infringement.
from
in
1970...
for
at
least
another
28
years
they
would
treat
the
use
of
the
film
copyright
as
an
infringement.
and
they
said:
that
won't
hurt
anybody
because
people
will
just
make
new
arrangements.
but
there
are
reasons
why
they
won't.
first
of
all,
in
a...
in
the
usual
copyright
infringement
case,
an
injunction
is
the
usual
remedy.
so
that
gives
tremendous
leverage
to
the
owner
of
the
original
copyright
or
the
underlying
copyright.
and
there's
a
great
danger
we
think
here
that
undermines
copyright
policy
because
if
someone
in
the
position
of
a
short-story
owner
has
too
much
leverage,
he
is
using
the
monopoly
power
congress
gave
him
in
the...
for
his
short
story...
not
to
just
reap
the
benefits
of
his
short
story.
he's
not
coming
to
us
and
telling
us
he
wants
to
make
a
new
movie.
he's
coming
to
us
and
saying:
i
want
what
you
make
on
your
movie
and
on
the
new
matter
that
you
have
put
into
your
movie.
that's
what
he
wants
to
do.
that's
the
game.
and
there
are
reasons
to
believe
that,
for
example,
speculators
that
get
into
this
field
will
refuse
to
give
consent.
they
have
reasons
not
to
give
consent.
first
of
all,
they
have
a
comparatively
low
investment.
the
plaintiff,
in
this
case,
bought
his
rights
for
$650.00.
well,
when
he
negotiates
with
somebody
who
has
spent
$2
million
to
make
and
to
release
a
motion
picture,
he
has
considerable
leverage
in
deciding
how
long
he's
willing
to
negotiate.
secondly,
the
person
who
takes
over
the
rights
of
the
underlying
copyright
has
other
rights
to
exploit
in
the
meantime.
he
doesn't
have
to
sit
around
and
negotiate
with
the
movie
owner
or
the
other
derivative
work
owner.
he
can...
he
gets
to
go
back
and
exploit
all
the
rights
that
the
author
originally
had,
in
the
meantime.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
yes.
it
wouldn't
be
any
different
if
he
had
given
us
all
rights
of
copyright.
we
still,
under
the
second
circuit
view,
we'd
only
be
left
with
those
rights
we
had
actually
exercised.
if
we
had
made
a
movie,
then
we
could
continue
using
the
movie.
this
is
the
same
solution
that
congress
came
up
with
under
the
1976
act.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
entirely.
we
have
no
position...
we
have
no
position
without
it.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
yes.
we
couldn't
get
a
copyright
without
the
original
owner's
consent.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
i
don't
think
so
because
we
rely
entirely
on
the
fact
that
we
have
a
copyright
which
was...
gives
us
rights
under
section
24
of
the
old
law.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
well,
if
we
had
not
gotten
a
copyright
we
couldn't
exclude
others
from
using
our
new
matter.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
oh,
i
understand
that.
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you...
what
gives
us
the
problem
here
is...
that
congress
apparently
was
thinking
of
giving
some...
giving
all
copyright
owners
a
so-called
second
chance.
but
they
weren't
thinking
necessarily
of
this
situation.
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to
show
that.
and
so,
if
you
just
think
about
one
copyright
and
you
say,
all
right,
after
the
person
dies
it
reverts
and
goes
back.
what's
the
harm?
well,
that's
all
right.
but
you
have
harm
here
because
there
have
been
other
copyrights
that
have
come
into
existence
in
the
meantime,
and
congress
specifically
intended
that
they
would
have
the
58
years
of
enjoyment.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
no,
your
honor.
because
they
can
avoid
us
by
simply
not
using
that
which
we
added
to
the
film.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
no.
because
we
don't
have
the
right
to
exploit
our
own
work.
what
good
is
the
work--
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
--well,
yes.
and...
you're
right,
it
doesn't
give
us
the
right
to
exploit
our
own
work.
what
i
was
trying
to
explain
is
that,
because
congress
wanted
us
to
have
the
right,
this
copyright,
this
valuable
right,
it
is
implicit
in
that
that
the
congress
did
not
want
the
so-called
second-chance
policy
to
operate
in
a
way
that
would
benefit
one
author
at
the
expense
of
the
other
author,
wouldn't
want
to
cut
off
our
enjoyment
of
our
copyrights
simply
because
it
was
going
to,
in
one
case,
give
the
second
chance
to
the
original
author.
we
have...
we
are
now
in
our
second
term.
we
are
now
in
the
term
where
we're
supposed
to
be
getting
our
second
chance,
and
i
disagree
with
you,
justice
scalia.
the
right
to
exclude
someone
from
using
a
grace
kelly
character
is
not
a
very
valuable
right.
in
fact
the
record
shows,
in
this
case,
that
mr.
abend
went
out
and
made
a
deal
with
home
box
office
to
make
a
new
film
based
upon
the
short
story
without
our
characters.
so
nothing
stops
him
from
going
ahead
and
making
new
works
without
us.
and
the--
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
--yes,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
we
have
to
get
the
consent
of
any
prior
work
that
we
are
using:
music,
story,
graphics,
whatever.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
no,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
no.
they're
just
not
set
up
administratively
to
determine
those
things.
in
any
motion
picture
there
could
conceivably
be
dozens
of
works
that
are
used
in
the
motion
picture.
in
fact
every
motion
picture
today
would
probably
see
two
or
three
and
maybe
as
many
as
ten
licensed
songs,
and
they
had
to
get
permission.
and
all
of
those
songs
are
like
little
ticking
bombs
under
this
reversion
theory.
any
one
or
two
of
them
can
go
off,
and
now
you
can't
use
that
song
in
the
movie
after
the
death
of
the
composer
and
the
renewal
by
his
statutory
successor.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
sure.
but,
for
example,
you
can't...
if
you
want
to
make
a
picture
about
the
1960s
and
you
want
to
use
the
music
that
was
popular
in
the
1960s,
you
don't
always
have
that
choice.
and
so
you
use
licensed
music.
i
think
we've
said
in
our
reply
brief
that
mca
universal
did
about
250
hours
of
television
in
a
couple
of
year
periods
and
they
used
400
licensed
songs.
and
one
of
the...
as
i
was
going
to
say
earlier,
one
of
the
problems
with
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
is,
if
it
is
followed,
is
it
will
mean
that
the
works
from
1962
to
1978,
which
have
not
yet
been
renewed
and
are
subject
to
renewal
and
are
subject
to
reversion,
people
will
have
no
interest
in
wanting
to
use
them
because
they
don't
know
what
will
happen
at
the
time
of
renewal.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
but
under
the
ninth
circuit
view,
he
can't
give
away
the
right
to
use
that
work
in
the
future.
and,
therefore,
he's
giving
you
grief.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
correct.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
that's
correct.
so
you
don't
know
and
you
don't
always
have
a
way
to
buy
around
that
problem...
for
example,
in
this
case.
there's
no
way
that
jimmy
stewart
and
hitchcock
could
buy
from
mr.
woolrich's
executor
because
they
don't
know
who
his
executor's
going
to
be
until
he
dies,
and
until
we
know
what
the
will
says.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
we
rely
on
the
fact
that
congress
in
section
7
gave
derivative
works
the
same
standing
as
copyrights,
as
all
other
copyrights.
and
in
fact,
when
we
use
these
terms,
i
think
we
tend
to
make
too
much
of
the
labels.
mr.
woolrich's
work,
for
all
we
know,
could
be
a
derivative
work...
derivative
in
turn
of
something
before
it.
this
is
a
relative
term.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
but
the
right
to
enjoy
it.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
exactly.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
we
need
the
right
to
renewal
because
the
original
owner,
when
he
has
to
give
us
consent
to
make
the
work
in
the
first
place,
at
that
time,
he
can
put
any
restriction
on
us
he
wants.
and
at
that
time
it's
negotiated,
as
to
what
restrictions
or
time
limitations
or
territorial
limitations
one
may
give.
your
honor,
i
think
i
see
my
time
is
just
about
up.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
for
rebuttal.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
wanted
to
comment
on
the
fact...
answer
the
question
raised
by
counsel
about
where
rohauer
ends.
it
ends
precisely
where
the
present
statute
ends.
if
the
statutory
successor
takes
over,
the
derivative
work
owner
may
only
continue
to
exploit
the
existing
work
to
the
extent
that
he
was
given
the
right
to
do
so
by
the
original
arrangement.
it
would...
following
the
second
circuit--
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
--that's
right.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
if
we
had
not
produced
the
film,
we
would
have
nothing.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
because
they're
simply
a
version
of
the
film;
they're
just
a
copy.
it
is--
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
but
they
are
just
additional
copies.
i
mean,
there
is
no
reason...
if
you're
going
to
allow
us
to
use
the
film,
there's
no
reason
to
make
us
take
one
print
around
from
each
theater.
we
have...
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
reasonable
that
we
have
a
right
to
make
enough
copies
that
they
could
be
marketable
in
the
way
that
the
product
is
usually
marketed.
mr.
louis
p.
petrich
i
would
hope
not.
and
certainly,
that's
not
the...
what
congress
thought
was
a
reasonable
result
in
1976,
although
i'm
not
by
any
means
saying
that
what
the
congress
did
in
1976
has
to
govern
what
is
done
here.
in
fact
i
should
point
out
that
counsel
is
wrong.
in
our
brief,
at
page
41,
we
say
that
the
fair-use
issue
is
determined
by
the
1976
act
because
the
conduct
which
gives
rise
to
the
fair
use
all
occurred
after
1976.
but
the
renewal
issue
and
the
effect
of
the
death
of
the
original
author
and
the
renewal
by
the
executor
all
took
place
before
1976.
there's
no
way
that
the
1976
act
could
determine
the
effect
of
that
1970
renewal.
and
it's
not
reasonable
to
say
that
mr.
woolrich
didn't
get
fairly
compensated.
there's
no
record
of
that.
all
that's
in
the
record
is
that
he
sold
five
short
stories
to
people
who
were
willing
to
take
a
chance
that
they
might
use
some
of
them
in
a
film
someday,
and
that
he
got
a
payment
of
$9,200,
which
in
1987
was
worth
something
between
$50,000
and
$100,000.
it
was
entirely
up
to
him
whether
or
not
he
wanted
to
take
that
as
a
lump
sum.
and
for
all
we
know,
he
put
it
in
real
estate
and
it
came
out
better
for
him.
but
it...
i
just...
it's
not
reasonable
to
look
backwards
and
try
to
second-guess
what
made
mr.
woolrich
happy
in
1945.
as
far
as
the
special
expertise
of
the
registrar
and
professor
nimmer,
i
want
to
point
out
that
in
1960
the
registrar
said
that
the...
that
she
thought
it
looked
like,
in
the
case
where
a
work...
or
the
first
term
of
copyright
had
expired
by
agreement,
maybe
you
couldn't
use
that
work
any
longer.
and
she
cited
it
for
that...
the
ricordi
case...
not
this
court's
decision
in
miller
music,
which
had
come
out
earlier
in
the
year,
in
which
she
cited
ellsworth
throughout
her
study.
she
relied,
not
at
all,
on
the
miller
music
case.
and
professor
nimmer,
who
wrote
the
treatise
on
this,
from
1963
to
1977
said
not
a
word
about
miller
music
as
being
the
guide
in
this
case.
he,
too,
relied
on
the
ricordi
case,
which
judge
friendly
pointed
out
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
and
in
fact
the
re-reading
of
the
district
court's
decision
in
ricordi
will
show
that
paramount
pictures,
in
that
case,
who
was...
in
the
case
of
mr.
abend,
conceded
that
the
owner
of
the
opera
had
the
right
to
continue
performing
the
opera...
had
the
right
to
grant
new
rights.
