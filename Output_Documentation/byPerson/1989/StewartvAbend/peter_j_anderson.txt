mr.
peter
j.
anderson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
action
arises
under
the
copyright
act
of
1976,
not
the
copyright
act
of
1909.
petitioners
conceded
as
much
in
their
opening
brief
at
page
41,
where
they
state
that,
"the
infringement
action
here
arises
from
conduct
occurring
after
january
1st,
1978,
and
is
thus
governed
by
the
1976
copyright
act.
"
mr.
petrich
has
stated
that
the
renewal
copyright
in
the
film
rear
window
was
created
under
section
24.
that
copyright
was
claimed
in
1982
by
the
successors
to
the
creator
of
the
film,
patron,
inc.
as
a
result,
that
renewal
copyright
was
created
under
section
304(a)
of
the
copyright
act
of
1976.
mr.
petrich
has
told
the
court
that
what
he
wants,
and
what
rohauer
does,
is
to
give
the
same
exception
that
subpart
(c)
of
section
304
gives
to
derivative
works.
that's
the
exception
that
was
created
under
the
1976
act
to
allow
continued
use
of
the
underlying
basic
materials
added
or
elaborated
upon
in
a
motion
picture.
this
is
the
problem
with
mr.
petrich's
position:
his
renewal
copyright...
his
client's
renewal
copyright
was
created
under
section
304(a),
which
contains
no
right
to
continue
distribution
of
the
film.
he
nevertheless
asks
for
the
court
to
imply
that
the
exception
provided
in
subpart
(c)
also
applies
in
subpart
(a).
we
believe
that
since
this...
the
issues
arise
under
the
1976
copyright
act
and
since
that
act
reenacts
section
24,
that
the
court
is
now
bound
by
its
decision
in
miller
music.
below,
at
the
ninth
circuit,
the
petitioners
asked
or
suggested
to
the
court
that
this
court
would
reconsider
miller
music.
now
they
suggest
to
this
court
that
the
court
should
put
a
gloss
on
miller
music.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
it's
been
the
law
of
the
united
states
for
the
last
30
years.
it
was
also
a
natural
corollary
to
this
court's
decision
in
1943
in
fred
fisher.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
but
it's
not
actually
clear
that
this
would
be
an
extension
of
miller
music
beyond
its
facts.
in
miller
music,
the
court
had
a
publisher
before
it,
a
publisher
of
music,
and
it's
clearly...
it
has
been
the
practice,
as
this
court
noted
in
mills
music
v.
snyder,
and
as
the
screen...
excuse
me,
the
songwriters
guild
and
the
registrar
of
copyrights
note
in
their
amicus
briefs,
that
it
has
been
the
practice
for
a
publisher
to
authorize
derivative
works
based
upon
a
grant
of,
for
instance,
the
rights
to
the
words
for
a
song.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
implicitly
there
were.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
yes,
your
honor.
but
as
the
ninth
circuit
noted,
if
miller
music
holds,
as
it
does,
that
a
grant
of
the
entire
renewal
term
is
completely
void
and
unenforceable
against
the
statutory
successor
of
the
dead
author,
then
it
would
be
frankly
hard
to
figure
out
how
you
could
then
say
that
the
grant
of
some
rights
would
be
nevertheless
enforced
against
a
statutory
successor.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
your
honor,
we
think
it
would
actually
be
a
complete
undercutting
of
miller
because
of
the
practical
fact
that's...
publishers
of
music
don't
just
get
the
copyrights
in
a
completed
song.
they
get
the
copyrights
in
words;
they
get
the
copyrights
in
lyrics.
they
put
these
things
together.
sometimes
they'll
commission
or
employ
someone
to
add
the
words
to
existing
music
or
whatever.
but
they're
always
dealing
with
derivative
works.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
yes,
your
honor.
the
copyright
could
have
been
renewed
in
his
name,
if
he
had
refused.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
if
there
was
privity
of
contract
between
the
executor
and
the
party
compelling--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--no.
that...
and
that
is
this
court's
holding
in
miller
music.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
well,
the
renewal
assignment
is
not
a
dead
letter.
it
is
merely
the
assignment
of
an
expectancy,
as
the
court
stated
in
miller
music.
it's
not
invalid;
it
just
never
came
into
existence.
the
renewal
expectancy
was...
what
the
author--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--no.
the
executor
is
not
bound;
neither
is
any
of
the
other
statutory
successors
who
don't
have
a
contract
with
the
person
who
is--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--it's
worthless.
in
miller
music
the
court
specifically
said
it's
not
invalid.
it's
just
a
contingency
that
never
came
into
fruition.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
well,
i'm
not
too
sure
i
understand.
but
my
point
is
simply
this.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
register
of
copyrights
will
accept
a
claim
for
renewal,
even
if
it
is
not
signed
by
the
author.
if,
in
this
instance,
the
petitioners'
client,
or
the
petitioners
rather...
excuse
me...
had
taken
a
renewal
in
the
name
of
the
executor
of
mr.
woolrich's
estate,
and
taken
that
to
the
register
of
copyrights,
we
would
have
filed
an
action
to
have
that
set
aside
because
they
had
no
standing,
and
because
the
executor
had
not
in
fact
agreed
to
convey
the
renewal
copyright
in
the
story.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
the
fred
fisher
case?
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
there
is,
your
honor.
and
as
this
court
i'm
sure
is
aware,
there
has
been
a
fair
amount
of
comment
that
the
fred
fisher
case
undercut
the
policy
that
the
miller
music
case
actually
gave
effect
to.
and
that
policy
was
that
the
author
or
his
successors
were
to
have
a
second
chance
at
controlling
the
work.
in
fred
fisher
what
the
court
said
was
that
the
person
who
obtained
the
renewal
copyright
did
not
have
a
copyright
right
to
continue
using
the
work,
but
they
had
a
contract
right.
and
since
1943
that's
been
interpreted
to
mean
that
if
the
author
does
not
live
to
renew
and
there's
no
contract
right
with
the
author's
statutory
successors,
then
in
those
instances
the
policy
of
a
second
chance
is
fulfilled.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
absolutely.
and
that
is--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--well,
there
is
a
second
policy
that's
been
recited,
and
it's
interesting
the
petitioners
elevate
it
to
the
primary
policy.
if
you
read
the
legislative
history,
there
was
a
concern
that
if
a
work
was
not
being
used,
and
it
didn't
matter
to
the
author,
then
it
should
go
into
the
public
domain.
and
so
the
28-year
term
was
a
lapsing
device.
if
no
one
bothered
to
sign
a
piece
of
paper
and
give
it
to
the
register
of
copyrights,
the
work
went
into
the
public
domain.
that,
i
believe,
a
fair
reading
of
the
history
will
reveal
is...
was
a
secondary
concern,
that
the
primary
concern
was
giving
an
author
a
second
chance,
which
goes
back
to
the
statutes
enacted
in
the
19th
century.
the--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--actually
i
think,
your
honor,
that
a
careful
reading
of
fred
fisher,
first
of
all,
recites
the
statements
in
the
house
report
60-2222,
that
authors
were
often
making
unremunerative
transfers
because
of
their
unability...
or
the
inability,
rather,
to
evaluate
when
they
first
created
a
work
its
public
appeal.
and
so
they
were
in
the
situation
where,
either
because
they
were
just
starting
out
and
not
established,
or
they
didn't
know
if
the
work
was
going
to
be
a
success
or
not,
that
they
were
transferring
it
for
a
relatively
small
amount
of
money.
that
discussion
is
repeated
in
fred
fisher.
the
court
does
go
on
to
say
that
since
the
1909
act
specifically
allows
for
assignment
of
interest
and
copyright,
that
the
court
should
not
presume
that
such
interests
are
unenforceable
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
because
to
do
so
might
prevent
an
author
who
finds
himself
in
dire
straights
from
granting
rights
to
the
second
term.
i
would
note
once
again,
though,
that
we
are
under
the
1976
act
and
enacting...
reenacting
section
304...
or
excuse
me,
section
24
as
section
304(a)
and
in
abrogating
fred
fisher,
by
making
the
determination
right
wholly
inalienable,
the
legislature
noted
or...
excuse
me,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
again
wanted
to
focus
on
giving
the
author
a
second
chance
to
control
his
work.
if
that
was
not
the
sole
purpose
under
the
1909
act,
it
is
clearly
the
sole
purpose
under
the
1976
act.
the
lapsing
and
going
into
the
public
domain
does
not
apply
since
an
author
must
affirmatively
terminate
the
rights,
and
otherwise
his
copyright
would
continue
for
the
full
term
of
copyright.
the
petitioners
say
that
this
is
a
problem
because
it's
an
author
versus
author
instead
of
author
versus
user.
and
i
think
that
highlights
a
little
bit
of
confusion
that
has
run
throughout
petitioners'
briefs...
the
dissent
abend
and
in
mr.
engel's
article.
the
sole
authority
cited
by
petitioners
prior
to
1976,
asserting
that
the
abend
rule
was
not
actually
the
law.
and
this
confusion
is
that...
is
the
confusion
between
the
derivative
work
on
the
one
hand
and
the
matter
protectable
by
the
derivative
copyright.
it
is
easy
for
petitioners
to
throw
up
their
hands
and
say
that
they
can't
use
the
film.
they
are
not
entitled,
necessarily,
under
the
copyright
act
to
use
the
film.
their
protection
is
in
the
new
matter
that
they
have
added.
to
the
extent
that
they
want
protection.
a
second
chance
to
use
the
matter
that
they
took
from
the
story...
they're
a
user.
they
didn't
create
the
story.
and
although
it
was
never
briefed
and
it
was
never
an
issue
because
we
did
not
move
for
an
injunction,
we
did
not
try
to
show
irreparable
injury,
the
fact
that
the
film
has
its
genesis
in
this
story
was
accepted.
we
have
not
gone
through
and
shown
the
court
the
extent
to
which
the
film
takes
from
the
story.
just
as
one
example--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--absolutely.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
yeah.
you
would
have
to
say
no.
the
statute
doesn't
allow
it,
but
it's
not
necessarily
a
practical
problem.
films
are
made
because
of
the
anticipation
of
getting
a
revenue...
generating
a
revenue
in
the
short
term.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
films
are
often
also
delayed
for
quite
a
period
of
time
before
they
actually
are
released.
it's
not
unusual
for
the
negotiations
for
rights,
the
negotiations
for
cast
to
take
nine
or
ten
years.
one
interesting
example
that
was
raised
in
petitioners
brief
was
singing
in
the
rain.
singing
in
the
rain
was
a
1952
film
that
employs
material,
words
and
music,
from
the
1929
copyright...
1929
plus
28
means
that
they
were
in
fact
facing
five
years
left
in
the
original
term
of
the
song...
well,
of
the
words
in
the
lyrics...
two
copyrights,
actually.
they
nevertheless
made
singing
in
the
rain.
in
our
case,
interestingly
enough,
paramount
paid--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--that's
not
accurate,
your
honor.
in
1952,
when
singing
in
the
rain
was
made,
that
was
one
year
after
g.
ricordi
was
decided.
g.
ricordi,
which
is
a
second
circuit
decision,
said
that
a
derivative
copyright
conveys
no
rights
in
the
underlying
work
and
that
once
the
license
was
terminated
or
once
there
was
no
license,
you
couldn't
continue
to
use
the
puccini
opera.
it
was
also
after
fitch
v.
shubert,
another
case
where
an
operatic
could
not
be
used
because
there
was
neither
a
copyright
right
or
a
contract
right.
it
was
after
the
1925
statement
by
mr.
dewolf
in
his
treatise
that...
of
our
exact
problem.
that
if
the
author
dies
before
renewal,
mr.
dewolf
stated
that
then
the
statutory
successors
could
come
in
and
bring
an
action
for
infringement,
if
they
continued
to
distribute
the
existing
work,
the
existing
movie.
and
the
motion
picture
association
of
america,
in
their
brief
as
amicus
curiae
in
desylva,
they
cite
mr.
dewolf
as
a
preeminent
authority
of
the
time.
and
by
the
way,
that
brief
was
authored
by
mr.
nimmer.
mr.
nimmer,
who,
petitioners'
counsel
states
has
represented
authors
has
also
represented
studios.
that
was
the
view
of
the
law.
in
1955,
mr.
bricker,
in-house
counsel
to
universal
studios,
said
exactly
the
same
thing.
so
it's
absolutely
clear
that
this
was
the
view
of
the
studios.
the--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
to
the
extent
that
petitioners
are
claiming
a
lack
of
fairness
in
this
result,
then
i
think
it
is
something
that
the
court
should
consider.
in
fact,
i
believe
in
fred
fisher
the
court
talked
about
industry
practices;
in
desylva
they
talked
about
industry
practices.
in
some
instances--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--and
that
was
my
second
point,
your
honor.
thank
you.
that
the...
that
movies
are
made
in
contemplation
of
the
risk
that
continued
rights
to
distribute
the
film
are
going
to
evaporate.
singing
in
the
rain
was
five
years.
if
i
could
get
back
to
the
paramount
example.
paramount
pictures
paid
for
the
production
of
the
rear--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--i
know
of
no,
and
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
of
a
motion
picture
company
that
went
bankrupt
because
of
this
issue.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
i
understand
the
court's
point,
and
i
would
again
note
that
universal,
which
is
the
subsidiary
of
petitioner
mca,
never
came
up
with
a
single
instance
of
deadlock.
clearly,
if
anyone
can
do
it
universal
can
do
it.
the
amicus,
who
are
all
the
other
major
production
companies
except
disney,
which
is
not
joined
in
the
petition
before
this
court,
no
one
has
been
able
to
come
up
with
any
evidence
that
a
film
evaporated
because
of
this
specter
of
copyright
death.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
yes,
your
honor.
the
point,
as
i
understood
it,
in
the
dissent
to
miller
music
was
that
that
rule
should
not
be
extended
to
executors.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
still
the
case
under
the
inalienable
termination
rights.
and
it
is,
again,
extended
to
authors
who
survive.
authors,
widows
and
children
can
come
in
and
terminate
a--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--yes.
absolutely.
that
goes
back
even
before
fred
fisher.
and
fred
fisher,
although
it
has
been
criticized,
was
accurately
precicted
by
the
majority
of
the
commentators.
the...
if
i
could
just
make
the
one
point
about
paramount.
paramount
pictures
paid
for
the
production
of
the
rear
window
film...
never
got
the
copyright
in
the
film,
because
what
it
did
was
it
advanced
the
production
costs
so
that
it
could
be
made
in
the
name
of
patron.
patron
then
got
the
copyright.
and
what
paramount
got
was
the
right
to
distribute
the
film
for
eight
years.
so
here
you
have
a
motion
picture
company
that
had
the
absolute--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--from
patron.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
yes,
your
honor.
it's
a
relatively
common
practice
nowadays.
so
paramount
when...
made
this
investment
through
patron
but
knowing
that
it
would
have
no
right
at
all
to
exploit
the
film
past
eight
years.
an
agreement
was
reached
where
that
was
extended,
but
initially
they
were
limited
to
an
eight-year
term.
so
the
concept
that
a
derivative
work
might
not
be
made
employing
existing
materials
because
of
risks
that
might
come
up
in
four
or
five,
eight
years,
simply
is
not
borne
out
by
the
facts
or
the
historical
record.
and
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
what's
more
likely
to
happen,
and
i
believe
it
will
happen
with
the
supposed
conflict
between
pre-'78
and
post-'78
works,
is
that
you'll
get
the
works
used
but
the
price
is
going
to
reflect
the
risk.
and
of
course,
that's
always
been
the
case.
and
in
fact
that's
one
of
the
problems
with
the
rohauer
decision.
the
price
paid
to
mr.
woolrich
for
the
renewal
rights
reflected
the
risk
that
they
would
never
vest.
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
rohauer,
the
studios,
who
have
never
paid
for
the
rights
from
the
statutory
successors
and
never
paid
consideration
that
was
equal
to
a
vested
right
to
continue
to
use,
would
nevertheless
get
a
vested
right.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
the
petitioners
and
the
motion
picture
studios
who
filed
their
amicus
brief
claimed
that
they
had
relied
on
rohauer
for
the
11
years
and
that
that
should
be
a
fact
that
the
court
should
consider.
now,
the
court
did
deny
cert,
in
rohauer,
and
we
think
that
the
court
should
have
a
free
hand
to
rule
on
the
issue
on
the
merits
instead
of
what
may
have
happened
over
the
last
11
years.
but
the
points
i
would...
the
more
obvious
reasons
why
they
could
not
have...
reasonably...
i'm
sorry...
reasonably
relied
on
the
rohauer
decision
was
that
within
two
years
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
said
that
rohauer
was
unconvincing
and
did
everything
except
knock
it
off
the
books
in
the
ninth
circuit.
the...
also,
furthermore--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--yes,
your
honor.
but
it
sure
put
the
studios
on
notice
that
if
this
issue
came
up
in
the
ninth
circuit,
what
happened--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--exactly.
professor
nimmer
immediately
called
the
rohauer
decision
plainly
wrong
and
said
that
he
doubted
that
other
courts
might
follow
it.
but
on
also--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--my
point
is
the
weight
that
the
studios
give
mr.
nimmer.
and
that
weight
was--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--your
honor,
it's
a
treatise;
it's
a
commentary.
and
i'm
not
saying
that
it
binds
this
court.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
but
i
am
saying
that
for
the
studios
to
say
that
they
reasonably
relied
on
rohauer,
when
the
premier
authority
in
the
field
said
that
it
was
plainly
wrong,
i
think
that
someone
should
think
twice
about
how
much
reliance
they
actually
did
put
on
rohauer.
furthermore,
rohauer
involved
the
showing
of
a
preexisting
print
that
was
made...
they
made
one
videotape
copy
and
then
showed
that
preexisting
print
over
a
public
television
station.
what
the
petitioners
have
done
here
is
made
several
thousand
new
35-millimeter
print
versions
of
the
film,
and
made
several
hundred
thousand
new
videotape
copies.
each
time
they
made
a
new
copy
that
was
an
infringement
of
a
separate
and
different
right
than
the
one
that
was
involved
in
rohauer.
so
to
say
that
the
studios
could
reasonably
rely
on
rohauer,
which
was
referred
to
as
unconvincing
within
two
years
by
the
ninth
circuit...
by
the
way,
also
in
1977
in
the
register's
report,
it
called
rohauer
one
of
the
biggest
surprises
under
the
1909
act.
when
you
have
the
register
saying
it's
a
surprise;
when
you
have
rohauer
carefully
noting
that
only
one
videotape
was
made
and
it
was
a
preexisting
print,
for
the
studios
then
to
march
out
boldly
making
thousands
and
thousands
of
new
copies,
distributing
works
in
videotape
form
and
otherwise
going
far
beyond
rohauer,
then
i
think
that
their
just...
their
reliance
on
rohauer
is
clearly
not
justified.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
registrar
of
copyrights
put
it
very
well.
the
only
caveat
i
would
add,
though,
is
that
there's
that
one
language
which
petitioners
have
tried
to
find
shelter
in...
that
it's
a
confusing
area
of
the
law.
and
if
i
might
just
explain
a
little.
there
is
no
doubt
that
some
provisions
of
the
renewal...
excuse
me...
some
of
the
renewal
provisions
are
confusing.
it
wasn't
until
within
the
last
year
that
a
district
court
squarely
dealt
with
the
issue
of
what
happens
if
an
author,
at
the
beginning
of
the
27th
year,
renews
the
copyright
and
then
dies
and
then
someone
else
comes
in...
his
statutory
successor.
so
there...
it's
clear...
and
that
i
think
was
the
kind
of
uncertainty
that
was
left
open
to
construction.
and--
but
as
far
as
this
issue
goes,
i
think
the
registrar
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
when,
in
the
brief,
they
say
that
this
case
presents
a
straightforward
interpretation
of
fred
fisher
and
miller
music.
the
petitioners'
counsel
has
attempted
to
explain
rohauer,
or
to
justify
it
by
saying
that
what
it
does
is
it
gives
effect
to
the
consent
of
the
author.
and
the
problem...
and
it
limits
the
new
uses,
or
the
continued
use
to
that
consent.
well,
there
are
several
problems
with
that.
and
the
first
one
is
that
you
can
read
rohauer
and
you
will
never
find
the
court
itself
expressing
that
opinion.
that
is
the
general
interpretation
of
rohauer
because
that
is
all
that
the
defendant
wanted.
however,
in
petitioners'...
at
the
district
court
level,
petitioners,
in
one
of
their
memorandums,
which
appears
as
docket
number
101
at
page
19.
they--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
copyright
act
provides
that
the
administrative
functions
will
be
exercised
by
the
registrar
of
copyrights.
i
believe
that
section
is--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--your
honor,
i
think
the
registrar
is
the
person...
or
is
the
person
who
is
in
charge
of
the
administration
of
the
copyright
act.
for
one,
has
to
decide--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--they
do
issue
guidelines
or
the
registrar's
compendium
of
practice
whether
that
is
a
"regulation"--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--since
they
have,
i
sure
hope
they
are,
but
i...
frankly,
i
can't
answer
that
question.
it
was
not
something
that
was
either
raised
in
petitioners'
reply
or
otherwise.
they
have...
the
registrar
has
nevertheless
appeared
and
has
nevertheless
urged
affirmance
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision.
the
point
that
i
was
about
to
make
was
that
in
the
district
court,
the
petitioners
said
that
there
was
no
limit
in
rohauer
that
prevented
the
petitioners
from
making
remakes
of
their...
of
their
film.
when
we
came
back
and
said
that
that
would...
has
blown
rohauer
completely
into...
into
new
abuses,
they
back-pedaled
and
said:
well,
what
rohauer
was
really
trying
to
effect
was
limiting
the
new
uses
to
the
scope
of
the
consent
that
was
given
by
the
author.
and
there
are
some
substantial
problems
with
that.
mr.
woolrich
consented
to...
if
mr.
woolrich
consented
to
remakes,
why
is
it
that
petitioners
can't
make
remakes,
if
the
point
of
rohauer
is
that
it
gives
effect
to
his
consent?
if,
as
petitioners
now
state,
that
it's
limited
by
the
extent
to
which
they
exercised
their
rights...
well,
they
never
exercised
the
right
to
make
videotape
copies.
but
now
they've
made
millions
of
dollars
exploiting
videotape
copies.
so
it's
very,
very
difficult
to
find
out
intellectually
where
rohauer
ends
and
where
you...
what
effect
you
give
to
the
consent
of
the
author,
assuming
that
you
want
to
give
any
effect
to
it
in
light
of
the
court's
holding
in
miller
music.
the...
excuse
me.
the
other
problem
with
rohauer
is
that
it
gives
no
compensation
at
all
to
the
owners
of
the
statutory...
the
owners
of
the
renewal
copyrights
and
books.
the
petitioners
have
said
that
my
client
received
the
rights
to
the
renewal
copyright
for
$650.00.
the
actual
transaction
was
that
he
was
going
to
share
with
the
trust...
excuse
me...
created
by
mr.
woolrich's
will,
10
percent
of
all
monies
generated.
this
is
a
transaction
that
chase
manhattan
bank
handled
as
the
trustee...
that
they're
very
happy
with.
and
there's
been
no
claim
of
overreaching
from
them,
although
petitioners
would
like
to
make
that
claim
here.
the
main
point
that
i
would
like
to
make,
though,
is
that
this
is
not
a
case
between
jimmy
stewart...
although
it's
a
case
between
jimmy
stewart
and
mr.
abend,
it
is
not
an
issue
solely
between
them,
that
this
case
will
have
far-reaching
effects.
the
vast
majority
of
the
renewal
copyrights
are
owned
by
the
children
and
the
widows
of
authors
who
had
films
made
based
upon
their
books.
and
the
question
is,
will
they
participate
in
the
profits
that
are
generated,
directly
attributable
to
the
use
of
the
stories
and
novels
in
the
second
term
of
copyright,
what
the
petitioners
claim
is
an
entitlement
to
a
second
chance
to
use
their
film.
as
i've
noted,
they're
confusing
the
use
of
the
film
with
the
use
of
the
new
matter.
what
they're
really
asking
for
is
a
second
chance
to
impose
the
bad
bargain
that
the
author
made
on
his
statutory
successors.
here
is
mr.
abend;
in
another
case
it's
going
to
be
the
next
of
kin
of
the
woman
who
wrote
gone
with
the
wind
or
the
sound
of
music
or
dr.
zhivago.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
well,
your
honor,
the
problem
that
i
have
with
that
is...
first
of
all,
we
didn't
ask
for
an
injunction
before
that
appeal
went
up.
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
well,
i
do
not
agree--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--as
to
our
case
for
the
simple
reason...
for
instance,
the
court
says
that
we
haven't
made
a
showing
of
irreparable
injury.
we
never
were
required
to
because
we
did
not
move
for
a
preliminary
injunction
and
we
did
not
move
for
a
temporary
injunction.
we
did
not
ask
for
a
summary
judgment.
in
total,
we
asked
only
for
a
summary
judgment
because--
mr.
peter
j.
anderson
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
court
properly
said...
the
ninth
circuit
properly
said
that
injunctive
relief
has
always
been
discretionary.
and
i
think
that
the
amount
of
new
matter
that
is
included
in
a
derivative
work
is
one
of
the
factors
that
the
court
could
consider
in
a
proper
court...
in
a
proper
case,
after
a
full
briefing
and
with
all
the
evidence,
that
a
court
might
say
that
an
injunction
is
an
improper
remedy.
