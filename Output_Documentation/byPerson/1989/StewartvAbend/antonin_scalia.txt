oh,
no.
but
they
want
to
have
grace
kelly
and
all
of
that.
they
want
to
do
it.
it's
essentially
the
same
plot
from
the
movie.
they
don't
want
a
new
movie;
they
want
a
remake
of
rear
window.
they'd
have
to
come
to
you
and
pay,
right?
so
that
you
would
have
the
full
value
of
the
renewal
copyright...
of
your
copyright,
the
right
to
exclude
them.
justice
scalia
but
that's
not
what
a
copyright
gives
you.
justice
scalia
mr.
petrich,
let's
assume.
let's
stipulate
that
that's
a
very
bad
disposition.
the
question
remains
whether
that
is
the
disposition
that
congress
enacted.
what
is
the
text
of
the
statute
that
you
rely
upon
to
say
that
it
is
not?
justice
scalia
so
that
it
ultimately
gets
back
to
your
contention
that
the
same
standing,
as
all
other
copyrighted
works,
includes
not
only
the
right
to
exclude
people--
justice
scalia
--but
the
right
to
use
yourself.
justice
scalia
okay.
well,
i
don't
why
then
you
even
need
an
assignment
of
the
renewal.
there's
still
two
copyrights
and--
justice
scalia
you
know,
it
also
goes
to
show,
i
would
assume,
whether
the
skies
will
fall
if
we
continue
what
they
have
assumed
to
be
the
rule.
