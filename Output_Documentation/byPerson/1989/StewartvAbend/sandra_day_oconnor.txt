justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
petrich,
i
gather
that
the
rohauer
decision
has
certainly
not
been
unanimously
acclaimed
in
the
scholarly
community,
one
might
say.
justice
o'connor
and
the
registrar
of
copyrights,
i
guess,
has
filed
something
indicating--
justice
o'connor
--well,
perhaps
that's
up
to
congress.
but
congress
created
this
unusual
scheme,
and
apparently
with
the
idea
of
letting
the
original
artists
or
author
benefit
from
whatever
enhancement
has
developed
by
virtue
of
use
of
the
derivative
works
in
the
interim.
justice
o'connor
unless
they
reached
an
agreement
with
the
respondents
to
allow
for
the
use
at
some
compensation.
justice
o'connor
well,
now
under
the
work
made-for-hire-arrangement,
presumably
the
motion
picture
industry
can
solve
some
of
these
problems.
justice
o'connor
well,
they
will,
depending
on
the
price
that
they
negotiate
for
them.
i
mean
i...
frankly,
my
guess
is
that
there
isn't...
there
isn't
a
way
that
the
author
can
get
a
lot
of
money
without
negotiating
with
somebody
who's
made
the
derivative
work.
justice
o'connor
not
until
within
a
year
of--
justice
o'connor
--the
renewal.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
raises
an
issue
of
copyright
law.
the
author
of
a
preexisting
work
may
assign
to
another
the
right
to
use
the
preexisting
work
in
a
derivative
work.
in
this
case,
the
author
of
a
preexisting
work,
a
story,
agreed
to
the
production
of
a
derivative
work
and
agreed
to
assign
the
rights
and
the
renewal
term
of
the
preexisting
work
to
the
petitioner.
the
petitioner
then
incorporated
the
preexisting
work
into
a
derivative
work
a
movie
called
"rear
window".
the
author
of
the
preexisting
work
however
died
before
the
commencement
of
the
renewal
period.
this
case
requires
us
to
decide
whether
the
owner
of
the
derivative
work
infringe
the
rights
of
the
successor
owner
of
the
preexisting
work
by
the
continued
distribution
and
publication
of
the
derivative
work
during
the
renewal
term
of
the
preexisting
work.
we
must
also
decide
whether
the
derivative
work
owner’s
use
of
the
preexisting
work
constitutes
a
fair
use
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
copyright
law.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
owner
of
the
derivative
work
infringes
the
rights
of
the
successor
owner
of
the
preexisting
work
by
distribution
and
publication
of
the
work
during
the
renewal
term
where
the
successor
owner
has
not
granted
permission
for
use
of
the
work
during
the
renewal
term.
our
decision
follows
our
previous
decision
in
miller
music
corporation
against
daniels.
we
also
hold
that
petitioner’s
use
of
the
preexisting
work
does
not
constitute
a
fair
use
of
the
work.
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
is,
therefore,
affirmed.
justice
white
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
which
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
justice
scalia
have
joined.
