chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
stewart
v.
abend.
mr.
petrich.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
abend
is
an
agent?
chief
justice
rehnquist
under
the
second
circuit's
view,
the
owner
of
the
woolrich
copyright
could
make
another
movie
based
on
it,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
under
the
second
circuit's
view...
supposing
mr.
abend,
who
i
understand
owns
the
woolrich
short
story--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--could
he
not
now
make
another
movie
based
on
that
short
story?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
petrich.
mr.
anderson,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
decided
by
a
very
closely
divided
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
but
the
fact
that
it's
a
statutory
decision
is
based
on
a
decision
by
a
closely
divided
court...
is
not
a
basis
certainly
in
itself
for
overruling
it.
but
it's
certainly
also
a
reason
perhaps
not
to
extend
it
beyond
its
facts.
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
weren't
two
copyrights
involved
in
miller,
were
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
there
were
not
expressly.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
an
extension
of
miller.
chief
justice
rehnquist
isn't
there
some
tension,
as
lawyers
say,
between
the
fielding
case
and
the
miller
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
sorry.
fred
fisher.
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
policy
can
be
defeated
by
the
author
assigning
the
renewal
right
in
advance
of
its
exercise?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
in
effect
that...
you
know,
if
you
say
the
entire
policy
is
to
give
authors
a
second
chance,
fielding
does
not
carry
that
out...
or
rather
fisher.
so
there
must
be
some
other
policy
involved
in
the
act.
chief
justice
rehnquist
certainly
one
can
read
the
fielding
opinion
and
not
have...
i'm
sorry,
the
fisher
opinion,
and
not
get
the
feeling
that
that
was
the
primary
purpose
of
the
copyright.
there
are
several
comments
in
the
opinion
about
the
fact
that
we
can't
import
into
the
law
a
chance
to
give
impecunious
authors
a
second
chance,
when
congress
hasn't
put
it
there.
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
that
make
it
binding
on
the
courts,
that
it
was
the
view
of
the
studios?
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
from
who
did
paramount
get
the
right
to
distribute
the
film
for
eight
years
from?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
patron?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
did
the
studios
pay
no
attention
to
rohauer
after
it
came
down,
when
it
was
the
only
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
the
field?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
all
that
would
do
was
create
a
conflict.
i
mean...
the
ninth
circuit
isn't
superior,
even
in
california.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
might
go
the
other
way.
chief
justice
rehnquist
wait.
how
much
weight
should
we
give
to
a
professor,
admittedly
a...
respected
authority
in
the
field,
calling
a
decision
wrong?
chief
justice
rehnquist
to
what
extent
does
that
bind
this
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
hope
you're
not.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
the
registrar
authorized
to
appear
in
court
on
his
own,
without
appearing
through
the
solicitor
general?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
anderson.
mr.
petrich,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
have
to
take
one
book
around
from
one
bookstore
to
another.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
petrich.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-2102,
stewart
against
abend
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
