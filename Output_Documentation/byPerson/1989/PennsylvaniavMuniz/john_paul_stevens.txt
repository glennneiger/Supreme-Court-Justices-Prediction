justice
stevens
mr.
eakin,
may
i
ask
you,
are
these
regular...
is
this
the
routine
that's
followed
with
everyone?
justice
stevens
is
it
pursuant
to
regulation,
or
is
it
just
this
particular
police
department
that
does
this?
justice
stevens
you
said
they
always
do
it
the
same
just
by
custom,
not
by...
no
written
regulation
requires
this
procedure?
justice
stevens
what
would
happen
if
a...
if
an
individual
said
i
won't
do
it?
justice
stevens
does
he...
does
he...
does
he
violate
any
law
if
he
says
i
will
not
recite
the
alphabet
or
i
will
not
tell
you
my
sixth
birthday?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this
question?
you...
you
did
have
in
this
case
the
fact
he
refused
to
take
the...
the
one
test.
you
can
use
the
eye
movements,
and
you
can
use
the
staggering
down
the
line.
do
you
really
need
the
rest
of
the
evidence?
it
seems
to
me...
it
almost
sounds
cumulative
to
me
here
that
what
we're
fighting
about.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
too:
if
the
issue
were
not
whether
the
man
was
intoxicated,
but
say
it
was
in
a
different
kind
of
criminal
proceeding
and
the
issue
were
whether
he
was
mentally
competent
to
stand
trial,
or
mentally
competent
to
receive
the
death
penalty,
or
something
like
that,
would
you
say
you
could
perform
these
tests
without
giving
him
warning?
justice
stevens
why?
isn't
it
the
same
issue?
i
mean,
the
question
is
whether
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
protects
him
from
making
these
verbal
statements.
i
don't
know
why
the
nature
of
the
proceeding
should
matter.
justice
stevens
sometimes
that's
true,
but
you
could
also
have
a
case
where
you
just
want
to
find
out
how
his
mind
works
when
he's
asked
to
recite
the
alphabet
and
when
he's
asked
about
his
sixth
birthday
and
that
sort
of
thing,
i
would
think.
i
don't
know.
justice
stevens
suppose...
suppose
the
issue
is
whether
or
not...
or
one
of
the
issues
in
the
case
is
whether
or
not
he
can
speak
spanish,
and
the
police
officers
start
talking
to
him
in
spanish
to
see
if
he
responds.
can
they
ask
him,
do
you
speak
spanish?
justice
stevens
may
i...
may
i
question
that,
mr.
maffett?
it
seems
to
me
when
you
talk
about
the
contents
of
the
mind,
you
can
think
of
it
as
a
warehouse,
the
contents
of
which
are
all
sorts
of
information,
data,
facts
and
the
like.
and
there's
a
separate
question
is
how
well
the
machinery
in
the
warehouse
is
working,
and
that
is,
does
it,
if
you're
asked
to
recite
the
alphabet
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
how
is
the
mind
functioning,
how
is
the
nervous
system
functioning.
why
is
that
different
from
justice
white's
example
asking
him
to
walk?
that
tells
you
how
the
nervous
system
functions.
it
doesn't
reveal
any
of
the
material
that's
stored
in
the
warehouse.
i
think
contents
of
the
mind
means
something's
stored
there,
not
how
it
works.
justice
stevens
well,
sure,
but
it
might
be
a
function
of...
but
i
don't
know
how
that
advances
the
argument.
justice
stevens
well,
it's
from
his
mind
but
he's
showing
how
his
mind
works.
it
works
in
a
way
that
the
law
says
is
an
element
of
the
crime.
justice
stevens
that
conclusion
rested
in
part
on
how
the
mind
worked
and
in
part
on
the
facts
that
were
revealed
during
the
discussion
with
the
psychiatrist.
both
aspects
were
there.
