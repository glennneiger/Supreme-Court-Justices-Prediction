justice
kennedy
well,
would
he
have
a
right
to
refuse
to
answer
that
question?
he
says
i
refuse
to
answer
that
question.
justice
kennedy
well,
could
you
then
put
in
evidence
the
fact
that
he
refused
to
do
the
birthday
calculation?
justice
kennedy
well,
so
then
he
doesn't
have
the
right
to...
to...
to
refuse
to
decline
on
fifth
amendment
grounds,
at
least.
justice
kennedy
no,
he
has...
under
your
view
he
has
no
self-incrimination
right
not
to
answer
that
question,
because
if
you
say
that
he
does
then
you
can't
introduce
his
refusal
into
evidence.
justice
kennedy
no.
the
question
is
a
simple
one,
whether
or
not
he
has
a
fifth
amendment
right
to
decline
to
answer
the
question.
justice
kennedy
and
his
answer,
in
your
view,
is
not
used
to
incriminate
him,
based
on
his
knowledge?
justice
kennedy
how
do
you
know
spanish?
do
you
learn
it
in
your
arm?
no,
of
course
you
learn
it
in
your
mind,
don't
you?
justice
kennedy
suppose
this
defendant
is
very
nervous,
and
he...
what
he
does
is,
he
takes
his
existing
age
and
he
subtracts
six,
and
then
he
takes
that
number
and
subtracts
it
from
today's
date,
and
he
comes
out
wrong
either
because
he
doesn't
quite
do
it
right,
or
because
he
misses
a
month.
he
uses
years
and
he
has
a
late
birthday.
still
admissible
in
evidence?
justice
kennedy
would
he
have
to
get
onto
the
stand
to
explain
how
he
did
it
and
why
he
made
the
mistake?
justice
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
it's
qualitatively
different,
because
you're
asking
him
to
perform
a
mental
feat
that
requires
verbal
articulation,
and
that's
what
the
fifth
amendment
is
designed
to
protect
against.
