chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
89-213,
pennsylvania
v.
muniz.
mr.
eakin,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
just
as
he
doesn't,
i
suppose,
in
your
view,
to
refuse
to
walk
a
line?
chief
justice
rehnquist
although
neither
one
can
actually
be
compelled
in
a
police
station.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
eakin.
mr.
maffett,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
about
if
after
he
stopped
they
asked
him
to
walk
a
line?
chief
justice
rehnquist
supposing
he
was
in
custody
or
he
had
been
arrested
and
they
then
ask
him
to
walk
a
line?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
is
the
result
of
walking
the
line
admissible
if
he
has
not
previously
been
given
miranda
warnings?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
may
not
be,
but
i'm
very
interested
in
your
answer
to
the
question.
chief
justice
rehnquist
because
it
discloses
what
you
refer
to
as
the
contents
of
his
mind?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you...
do
you
regard
that
as
a
satisfactorily
precise
phrase,
disclosing
the
contents
of
one's
mind?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
voice
exemplar
cases
and
the
handwriting
sample
cases?
why
do
they
not
disclose
the
contents
of
one's
mind?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
does
take
brain
activity
to
produce
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
there's
certainly
an
intention
to
convey
an
idea.
is
that
what
you
mean
by
an
intention
to
convey--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
what
if...
what
if...
what
if
you
ask
me
to
give
a
writing
sample,
and
i
write
"the
quick
brown
fox
jumped
over
the
lazy
dog?
"
now
i'm
there
communicating
an
idea,
am
i
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the
handwriting
sample
cases
depend
upon
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
told
what
to
write,
which
is
all
right,
or
said
write
anything
you
want,
which
is
not
all
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and...
and--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--for
the
same
reason
that
walking...
that
an
ability
to
walk
a
line
would
be
inadmissible
in
your
view?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
let's
just
take
the
typical
situation
where
he's
told
to
walk
a
line,
shown
how,
and
in
the
view
of
the
police,
doesn't
succeed.
and
you
say
you
have
a...
a
video
and
audio
of
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
doing...
he's...
the
police
simply
say
you
didn't
walk
a
straight
line.
and
the
video
confirms
that
he
didn't
walk
a
straight
line.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
should
that
make
any
difference,
when
we're
talking
about
the
availability
of
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
because
the
cases
have
said
identification
in
this
sense
is
not
testimonial.
not
that
it's
not
an
element
of
the...
not
that
it's
not
helpful
in
getting
the
person
convicted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
if...
if
we
know
that
a
person
with
a
certain
kind
of
handwriting
forged
this
check,
and
it
turns
out
that
you
have...
required
by
the
grand
jury
to
give
a
handwriting
example,
or
have
that
kind
of
handwriting,
that
is
very
obviously
a
link
in
the
prosecution's
case
against
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
if...
if
it
were
testimonial,
you
would
surely
have
a
right
to
object.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you...
you
say
the
difference
in
it
is
whether
it's
just
a
link
in
the
case
as
opposed
to
the
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
he
didn't
think
that
the
tests
he
was
given
had
some
bearing
on
whether
he
would
be
held?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
could
just
as
well
have
meant
he
thought
the
police
would
not
distort
the
results,
they
would
be
even-handed,
not
that
they
weren't
doing
anything
to
build
a
case
against
him.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
cumberland
county
just
to
the
west
of
dauphin
county?
you
say
you
practice
in
cumberland
county,
but
your
office
i
see
is
in
harrisburg.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
maffett.
mr.
eakin,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
eakin.
the
case
is
submitted.
