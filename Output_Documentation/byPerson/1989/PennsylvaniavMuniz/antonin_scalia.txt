justice
scalia
mr.
eakin,
there
is
this
difference
between
this
case
and
the
other
nontestimonial
cases
that
you
talk
about.
it
seems
to
me
you're
quite
correct
that
the
content
of
his
mind
is
not
the
object
of
the
enterprise.
it's
not
the
end
that
is
sought.
but
it
is
the
means,
and
in
these
other
cases...
that
is,
because
of
the
current
content
of
his
mind
you
know
that
he's
drunk.
you
don't
want
to
introduce
the
content
of
his
mind,
but
the
means
of
showing
that
he's
drunk
is
finding
out
the
current
content
of
his
mind.
wouldn't
you
acknowledge
that
difference,
and
that
that's
quite
different
from
walking
a
line
or
being
compelled
to
give
a
handwriting
exemplar
or
a
voice
sample
or
anything
like
that?
justice
scalia
you
don't
acknowledge
that?
weren't
you
trying
to
find
out
the
content
of
his
mind?
in
his
mind,
did
he
know
what
his
sixth
birthday
was?
justice
scalia
how
do
you
show
it?
you
show
it
by
asking
the
content
of
his
mind,
and
the
content
of
his
mind
proves
that
his
mind's
not
working
right.
isn't
that
the
same...
isn't
that
the
same
when
he
can't
walk
the
line?
justice
scalia
i
don't
consider
walking
a
line
the
content
of
the
mind.
that
may
be
a
function
of
the
brain,
but
when
we
talk
about
the
content
of
the
mind
you
mean
ideas,
you
mean
concepts.
that's
what
the
fifth
amendment
is
about.
justice
scalia
this
is
the
only
kind
of
a
situation
i
know
of
in
which
you
are...
to
be
sure,
you
don't
want
the
content
for
its
own
sake,
but
you
do
want
the
content
of
the
mind
as
a
means
of
showing
something
else,
and
that
differs
from
all
these
other
testimonial
situations,
it
seems
to
me,
or
nontestimonial
situations.
justice
scalia
you
can
give
me
another
case
where
we
have
used
the
content
of
the
mind
in
the
sense
of
ideas.
justice
scalia
that's
his
ability
to
move
his
lips.
you
give
him
a
paper
to
read.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
ideas
in
his
mind.
you
give
him
a
paper
to
read,
and
he
can't
move
his
lips.
it's
physical,
just
as
the
way
he
can't
move
his
feet.
but
in
order
to
find
that
he
can't
think
correctly,
you
must
know
what
the
content
of
his
mind
is,
what
idea
he
has
in
there,
so
you
ask
him
this
question.
now,
maybe
it's
okay,
but
it's
different
from
all
of
the
other
testimonial
cases
that
i
know
of.
justice
scalia
it's
not...
i
mean,
it's
physical,
but
a
mind
is
a
physical
thing.
the
reason
he
doesn't
walk
the
line
is
not
because
there's
something
wrong
with
his
foot,
it's
because
it's
something
wrong
with
his
mind.
justice
scalia
it
means
the
inability
of
his
mind.
it
shows
how
is
mind
is
working.
justice
scalia
but
you...
you...
you
wouldn't
limit
your...
your...
you
know,
the
constitution,
just
to
mention
it,
does...
does
say
that...
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
compelling
a
person
in
a
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
to
be
a
witness.
don't
you
think
that...
that
sort
of
focuses
on...
on
ideas,
on
the
conveying
of
not...
not,
you
know,
whether
your
mind
can
control
your
foot
or
not,
but
thoughts
and
ideas?
witnesses
do?
justice
scalia
yeah,
but
you're
now
saying
that
might
have
been
a
mistake.
i
mean,
you're
carrying
your
position
to
the
point
that...
that
even
where
what
he
says
does
not
disclose
thoughts
in
his
mind,
but
even
if
it
just
discloses
whether
his
mind
can
control
anything,
that
that
might...
might
be
bad.
justice
scalia
i'm
sure.
justice
scalia
and
i...
i
don't
know
that
that's
right.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
i
guess
in
the
same
way
you
can
say
when
you
give
a
voice
exemplar,
you're
trying
to
communicate
my
voice
sounds
like
this.
i
mean,
in
that
sense,
everything's
a
communication
of...
of
something
in
your
mind.
justice
scalia
communicating
my
voice
sounds
like
this
as
much
as
your
client
would
be
communicating,
you
know,
i
can
control
my
feet.
