justice
o'connor
well,
now
one
of...
one
of
the
questions
asked
at
the
processing
stage
was,
i
believe,
what
was
the
date
of
your
sixth
birthday.
justice
o'connor
now,
is
that
some
kind
of
a
routine
question
that's
asked
whenever
the
police
think
someone
might
have
been
drinking?
justice
o'connor
well,
wouldn't
the...
the
information
given
in
the
response
be
relevant
on
the
question
of
whether
the
person
had
been
drinking
or
not?
justice
o'connor
so
it
could
be
testimonial?
justice
o'connor
but
whether
he
responds
accurately
or
not
is
relevant?
justice
o'connor
and
you
would
propose
to
offer
it
and
use
that
against
him?
justice
o'connor
why
isn't
that
a
form
of
interrogation?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
is
to
get
evidence
to
use
against
the
person
to
establish
whether
they've
been
drinking
or
not.
justice
o'connor
it's
quite
unlike
asking
the
person
for
an
address
and
a
driver's
license.
justice
o'connor
that's
because
the
fifth
amendment
is
concerned
with
testimonial
communication.
that's
why
we're
concerned
and
that's
why
there
might
be
a
difference.
justice
o'connor
don't
you
think
the
question
is
one
that
the
police
would
reasonably
expect
would
result
in
an
incriminating
response
under
these
circumstances?
justice
o'connor
there
was
every
indication
this
person
had
been
drinking.
there
were
lots
of
indications
he'd
been
drinking...
staggering
around
and
slurred
speech
and
what
have
you...
so
they
knew
when
they
asked
that
birthday
question
it
was
likely
to
give
an
incriminating
response.
justice
o'connor
but
that's
not
an
interrogation.
justice
o'connor
and
this
is.
justice
o'connor
how
do
you
define
"testimonial"?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
about
asking
the
person
the
name
and
address?
justice
o'connor
so
you
think
here
every
single
question
that
was
put
to
this...
to
your
client
was
interrogation,
and
miranda
warnings
were
required
before
even
asking
the
name
and
address?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
you
would
take
the
position
that
it
was
required
at
roadside
as
well,
that
nothing
could
be
asked--
justice
o'connor
--before
giving
miranda
warning.
justice
o'connor
so
would
it
be
all
right
here
to
ask
the
defendant
to
recite
the
alphabet?
justice
o'connor
no.
it's
just
like
being
given
a
sentence
to
write.
