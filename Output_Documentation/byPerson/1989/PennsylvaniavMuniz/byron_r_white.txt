justice
white
is
there
any
challenge
in
this
case
to...
i...
i
guess
there
is...
to
the
introducing
the
videotape
of
the
physical
tests?
justice
white
well,
how
about
in
this
case,
in
this
case?
justice
white
well,
in...
in...
so
the...
the...
the
demonstration
that
he
couldn't
walk
a
straight
line,
that
shows
what
the
effect
of
alcohol
is
on
his
physical
coordination,
i
suppose?
justice
white
what
about
this
eye
test?
who...
you
can't
see
that
on
video,
can
you?
justice
white
and
is
that
what
happened
in
this
case?
justice
white
and
what
does
that
show?
justice
white
and
is
that
supposed
to
show
that
he
was
drinking?
justice
white
had
been
drinking?
justice
white
so
it
shows...
shows
the
alcohol,
the
effect
of
alcohol
on
his
eye
movement?
justice
white
just
like
you...
you
say
the...
the
birthday
question
shows
the
effect
of
alcohol
on
his
mind?
justice
white
was
he
asked
to
recite
the
alphabet?
justice
white
doesn't
it
come
from
the
brain?
justice
white
didn't
they
explain
the
test
to
him?
they
explained
the
breathalyzer
test?
justice
white
and
they
say,
do
you
understand?
justice
white
and
he
says
no,
i
don't
understand,
and
they
have
a
big
long
talk
about
it?
justice
white
now,
you
say
that
that
is
all
just
spontaneous?
justice
white
well,
it
says,
do
you
understand?
justice
white
well,
isn't
that
interrogation?
justice
white
that
may
be.
that
may
be,
but
the
question
is
about
the
statements
he
made
in
response.
justice
white
but
it
was
testimonial
evidence.
justice
white
wasn't
it?
justice
white
wasn't
it...
the
result
testimonial?
justice
white
what
words
do
they
use
when
they
ask
them
to
walk
the
line?
do
they
say,
will
you
do
it?
or,
please
walk
the
line?
what
do
they
say?
what
are
the
words?
justice
white
he
kept
saying
the
reason
i
can't
is
because
i've
had
too
much
to
drink?
justice
white
well,
you
don't
need
to
forego
the
physical
evidence.
the
question
is,
whether
the...
whether
the
statements
are
admissible,
as
well
as
the
physical
evidence.
justice
white
what
is
the...
how
much
damage
do
you
suppose
that
would...
would
be
done
to
the
program
if
you
had
to
give
miranda
warnings
as
soon
as
you
got
him
to...
to
the
station
house?
justice
white
well,
is
that...
that...
is...
is
that
all...
is
that...
you
just
have
that
one
instance,
or
is
there...
is
there
some--
justice
white
--is
the...
is
the...
is
the
experience...
is
it
the
experience
in
your
state
that...
that
successful
prosecution
of
drunk
driving
cases
is
really
difficult...
very
difficult?
justice
white
he
stopped
him,
didn't
he?
justice
white
he
stopped
him,
didn't
he?
justice
white
so
they
stopped
him?
justice
white
well,
on
that
basis
i...
i
would
suppose
that
if
you
ask
him
what's
his...
what's
your
age
and
he
answers
and
he
slurs,
you
could
use...
you
could
use
the
information
he
gave
you,
how
old
you
are,
but
you
couldn't
show
on
videotape
or
have
the...
have
the
audio
part
showing
that
he
slurred
because
that
shows
how
he's
speaking,
how
his
mind
is
letting
his
tongue
work.
justice
white
so
you
could
get
a
voice
exemplar
except
that
it
couldn't
include
a
slurring?
justice
white
so
the
slurring
is
inadmissible,
in
your
view?
the
fact
that
he
talks
in
a
slurred
manner
is
inadmissible
without
miranda
warnings?
justice
white
is
that
admissible,
in
your
view,
how...
how
he
walked
that
line?
is
that
admissible?
justice
white
well,
use
the
video.
justice
white
you
really...
you
really
think
that
there
was
a
finding
that
these
were
actually
compelled,
or
just
that
there
was...
it
was
equivalent
to
in...
in-custody
interrogation
that
would
demand
miranda
warnings?
justice
white
all
of...
all
the...
all
the...
all
that
would
needed
to
have
happened,
as
i
understand
it,
was
that
the
miranda
warnings
should
have
been
given
first?
justice
white
did
you
object
to
introducing
what
happened
at
the
roadside?
justice
white
so,
anything
that...
any
of
the
tests
there
were
admissable?
justice
white
xxx
statements
during
the
testing,
the
so-called
voluntary
statements
during
the
testing?
he...
could
he
have
possibly
have
thought
that
he
had
to
say
those
things?
justice
white
the
audio
of
all
of
that
was
excluded,
wasn't
it?
