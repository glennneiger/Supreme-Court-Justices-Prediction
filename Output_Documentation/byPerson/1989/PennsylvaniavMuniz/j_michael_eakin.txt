mr.
j.
michael
eakin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
we
have
a
drunk
driving
suspect,
inocencio
muniz,
who
was
legitimately
in
custody,
and
that
is
not
at
issue.
what
is
at
issue
is
what
the
police
did
with
mr.
muniz
once
they
lawfully
had
him
in
custody.
what
they
did
is
what
they
do
with
the
large
majority
of
drunk
driving
cases,
which
now
number
of
1,000
a
year
in
cumberland
county,
pennsylvania.
they
took
him
to
one
of
the
central
booking
stations
that
have
been
set
up
and
there
turned
him
over
to
several
processing
agents,
employees
of
the
county
whose
job
it
is
to
do
nothing
but
process
drunk
driving
suspects.
what
they
did
was
a
multi-step
function,
all
of
it
on
videotape.
they
bring
the
individual
into
the
room,
ask
him
some
routine
booking
questions,
his
name,
his
address,
his
social
security
number
and
such.
they
then
follow
that
with
several
sobriety
tests.
they
first
at
this
point
ask
him
to
try
to
calculate
the
date
of
his
sixth
birthday.
they
ask
him
to
walk
a
line,
nine
steps.
they
ask
him
to
balance
himself
on
one
leg
while
counting
to
30,
and
they
conduct
the
horizontal
gaze
nystagmus
test
which
measures
the
effect
of
alcohol
on
the
function
of
the
eye.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
well,
this
is
the
county,
which
encompasses
probably
state
police,
several
military
installations
and
20-odd
local
departments.
the
county
agents
do
it,
and
they
always
do
it
the
same.
the
latter
three
of
the
field
tests
are
what
are
called
the
standard
field
sobriety
tests.
they're
the
ones
that
are
recommended
by
the
national
highway
traffic
safety--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--no,
sir,
not
by
law
or
regulation.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
well,
the
law,
we
feel,
would
allow
the
police
to
compel
them
to
do
it,
but
practically
speaking
there
is
no
way
you
can
compel
a
person
to
walk
a
line
and
get
any
useful
information.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
no,
sir.
what
happens
is
that
the
videotape
which
is
available
would
indicate
the
circumstances
of
the
refusal,
and
so
the
refusal
may
come
into
evidence.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
but
there's
no
penalty,
excepting
the
breath
test,
which
is
the...
the
stage
of
the
process
that
follows
these
sobriety
tests
is
the
breath
test.
the
individual
is
advised
that
under
pennsylvania
law
there
is
an
implied
consent.
you
have
the
breath
test
here.
if
you
refuse
to
take
it,
you
will
lose
your
license
for
an
additional
year's
time,
regardless
of
the
conviction
or
lack
of
conviction
on
the
underlying
drunk
driving
case.
in
this
case,
mr.
muniz
made
several
statements
while
that
was
being
explained
to
him,
as
is
required
by
pennsylvania
law.
he
refused
the
test
eventually.
at
that
point
he
was
taken
again
to
another
table.
he
was
given
his
warnings
under
the
miranda
decision,
and
then
for
the
first
time
was
asked
specific
questions
aimed
at
his
drinking,
where
he
was
drinking,
what
he
had
to
drink,
where
he
was
coming
from.
the
test
in
this
case
or
the
issue
that
is
to
be
resolved,
we
submit,
is
the
distinction
between
those
latter
questions,
which
are
clearly
aimed
at
gaining
testimonial
evidence
from
the
accused,
and
everything
that
went
before,
which
was
gained
or
aimed
at
gaining
physical
evidence,
demonstrable
evidence.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
it
was
asked
routinely
in
cumberland
county
at
the
time.
since
the
decision
by
the
superior
court
it
has
not
been
asked,
but
it
was
at
that
time.
it
is
asked
at
the
conclusion
of
the
routine
booking
questions
and
immediately
before
the
horizontal
gaze
nystagmus
test.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
yes.
we
submit
it
would
be,
just
as
the--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--no,
no,
ma'am,
i
don't
believe
it...
it...
it
would
be
testimonial.
it
is
another
sobriety
test.
it
is
not
aimed
at
determining
the
truth
of
the
answer,
the
date
of
his
sixth
birthday.
what
it's
aimed
at--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--that's
correct.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
we
would
use
it
to
show
the
physiological
effect
that
alcohol
has
had
on
that
man's
brain,
not
to
elicit
the
contents
of
his
mind.
the
brain
controls
the
tongue--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--because
the
goal
is
not
to
achieve
testimonial
evidence.
it
is
not
to
achieve--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--that's
correct,
just
as
walking
the
line--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--that's
correct,
but
it
is
also
unlike
asking
him
how
much
did
you
have
to
drink.
what
it
is
designed
to
show
is
that
alcohol
has
affected
this
man's
brain
to
the
point
that
he
cannot
do
basic
calculations.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
i
suggest
he
probably
would,
just
as
he
can
refuse
to
answer
any
question.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
we
would
submit
you
can,
because
it
is
not
aimed
at
testimonial--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--what
he
has...
he
has
no
right
to
be
warned
of
the
consequences
of
refusal.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
as
a
practical...
perhaps
i'm
speaking
more
as
a
practical
matter
than
anything
else,
because
to...
to
compel
someone
in
that
circumstance
is...
is
practically
impossible
without
intervention--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--we
would
suggest
he
does
not
have
a
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
right.
we
have
the
right
to
compel
but,
practically
speaking,
no
ability
to
compel.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
in
this
case,
the
pennsylvania
supreme...
superior
court
merely
suppressed
the
audio
portion.
in
subsequent
cases
of
theirs,
they
have
said
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
force
the
defendant
to
choose
between
a
video
without
audio
and,
therefore,
have
suppressed
the
entire--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--in
this
case
it
was
merely
the
audio
that
was
suppressed.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
well,
to
a
degree
it
does.
in
this
specific
case,
his
explanations
as
to
why
he
could
not
walk
the
line
were
certainly
relevant.
if
we
have
the
right
to
ask
him
to
walk
the
line,
i
suggest
his
responses
to
that
request
or
that
demand
are
just
as
relevant
as
the
actual
walking
of
the
line
itself,
and
there
shouldn't
be
a
distinction
between
his
oral
refusal
to
do
this
test--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--you
can,
yes.
we've
had
experts
who
testify.
the
camera
zooms
in
such
that
the
face
of
the
accused--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--yes.
yes,
your
honor,
and
it
shows
the
eye--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--it
shows
the
eye
tracking
a
stimulus,
which
in
this
case
was
a
pencil,
from
side
to
side
slowly--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
that's
correct.
it
is...
the
question
is
not
aimed
at
getting
the
truthful...
what
is...
how
old
were
you
in
such
and
such
a
year.
it's
aimed
to
show
that
the
mind
is
affected,
not
the
contents
of
the
mind
but
the
brain
being
affected
by
alcohol.
the
brain
does
a
lot
of
things.
it
controls
your
feet
when
you
walk
the
line.
it
controls
your
tongue
when
you
go
to
talk.
that's
why
slurred
speech
is
one
of
the
classic
indicia
that...
that
defense
counsel
say,
well,
he
didn't
have
slurred
speech
when...
when
the
policeman
doesn't
hear
it.
it's
that
classic.
but
it's
because
the
brain
is
affected
by
alcohol,
not
the
tongue
itself.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
it
may
be,
your
honor,
but
the
goal
of
the
testing
is
to
establish
a
routine
that
gives
the
best
possible
evidence
to
the
finder
of
fact,
and
the
three
standard
tests
developed
by
the
highway
safety
council
are
ones
that
have
statistically
been
shown
to
correlate
to
a
very
high
degree
to
persons
over
the
legal
limit.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
i
think
that
would
have
to
be
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
the
case
i
think
of
is
the
estelle
case,
where
the
psychiatrist
in
that
case
was
using
the
substance
of
what
was
related
to
him
rather
than
forming
conclusions
without
regard
to
the
substance
of
it.
if
here
we
are
to
introduce,
for
the
truth
of
what
is
said,
his
response,
that's
different,
and
i
think
in
the
mental
health
cases
and
insanity
defenses
that--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--i
think
in
those
cases,
your
honor,
it
would
be
proper,
because
again,
it's
not
testimonial
in
nature,
it's
demonstrative
in
nature.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
in
that
case,
i
believe
it
would
be
proper
because
you're
not
asking
for
a
specific
fact
in
his
mind,
but
merely
a--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--it
would
be
to
incriminate
him,
but
not
because
of
the
contents
of
his
mind,
just
as
in
the
dionisio
case,
where--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--the
ability
to
speak
spanish
certainly
is
contained
in
the
mind,
but
if
the
court,
as
you
have,
have
allowed
us
to
take
voice
exemplars,
or
to
speak
at
a
line-up,
the
language
in
which
you
speak
is
equally
as
nonintrusive.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
i'd
suggest
it's
admissible,
but
certainly
the
weight
of
it
is
something
that
is
always--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--the
same
as
he
can
get
on
the
stand
to
explain
why
he
didn't
walk
the
line
properly
or
balance
properly,
or
anything
else,
he
can
get
on
to
explain
why--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--well,
the
cases
have
clearly
stated
that
if
the
purpose
is
to
get
the
contents
of
the
mind,
that's
one
thing,
but
the
processes
of
the
brain
in
being
able
to
do
basic
math
or
recite
the
alphabet
or
things
that
are
not
in
and
of
themselves
indicative
of
the
contents
of
the
mind
of
an
individual
relative
to
what
they're
looking
for,
that
is
different
and
ought
to
be
maintained
as
different.
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
an
oral
manifestation
rather
than
a
physical
should
not
matter.
we
don't
have
them
walk
the
line--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--there
might
be
a--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--only
in
the
same
level
as
they
would
expect
it--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--just
as
they
knew
when
he
would
walk
the
line
he
was
likely
to
incriminate
himself
in
that
manner,
but
not
in
a
testimonial
sense.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
it's
not
an
interrogation--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--it's
not
because
it's
not
testimonial;
it
is
physical.
it
is
demonstrative.
but
the
inability
to
count
to
six
is,
i
suggest,
the
same
as
the
inability
to
walk
six
steps.
the
function
affected
is
the
brain.
we're
not
asking
him
to
disclose
any
information
about
it.
the
fact
that
he
is
more
likely
to
say
something
incriminating
or
not
should
not
inhibit
the
police
in
gathering
physical
evidence,
which
i
suggest
this
is,
just
as
much
as
walking
the
line
is.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
no,
not
in
this
case.
again,
this
case
was
after
the
bruder
case
in
pennsylvania
which
at
the
time
said
that
was
improper
because
the
contents
of
the
alphabet
were
testimony,
which
i
suggest
they're
not.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
no,
i
don't--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--no,
sir.
we're
trying
to
show
that
his
physiological
ability
to
calculate
was
affected,
but
not--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--i'd
suggest
it
is
the
same.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
it
all
comes
from
the
brain,
and
what
we're
trying
to
show
is
not
how
old
he
was,
what
year
he
was
six...
that's
the
content
of
the
mind...
but
it's
the
inability
to
arrive
at
that
conclusion,
which
is
a
process
of
the
brain,
that
is
affected
by
alcohol.
the
judgment
driving
down
the
road
is
impaired
by
the
alcohol,
and
you
cannot
determine
is
this
your
street
or
not?
is
this
a
place
i
can
make
a
u-turn
or
not?
it's
not
introduced
to
show
what
the
street
is,
proper
or
improper.
it's
to
show
that
the
function
is
impaired.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
that's
correct.
facts.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
well,
i
certainly
respect
that
distinction
if
you
see
one,
your
honor,
but
i--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--again,
i
fall
back,
as
justice
white
says,
that
taking
nine
steps
physically,
taking
nine
steps
mentally,
neither
discloses
facts
that
that
individual
knows.
if
we'd
have
asked
him,
as
we
did
after
rights,
were
you
drinking,
that's
a
fact
in
his
mind.
that
is
his
ability...
if
he
slurs
his
words
in
answering,
that
is
not
testimonial.
it's
relevant,
but
it's
not
testimonial.
it's
not
the
contents
of
his
mind.
it's
not
the
extortion
of
information
from
him;
it's
the
extortion
of
is
ability
to
think,
not
what
he
thinks.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
well,
it
is
different
in
that
sense,
i
agree,
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
test
is
an
oral
one
rather
than
a
physical
one,
strictly
physical,
is
not
the
basis
for
the
court's
distinction
between
testimonial
and
demonstrative
evidence...
it
never
has
been,
i'd
suggest
never
should
be.
the
fact
that
no
fact
is
disclosed
here
is
significant.
the
purpose
for
this
information
is
not
to
show
the
date
of
his
sixth
birthday.
the
superior
court
in
this
case
felt
that
the
routine
questions
were
certainly
all
right.
we
had
the
right
to
ask
the
individual
to
submit
to
a
routine
sobriety
test
of
a
physical
nature.
they
said,
however,
at
some
point
during
the
latter,
mr.
muniz'
responses
became
communicative
in
nature
and
therefore
miranda
came
in
the
side
door
and
should
have
been
given
to
him
at
the
outset.
i
think
the
record
is
clear
that
these
were
spontaneous
remarks
made
in
response
to
his
instructions.
they
were
honest,
they
were
on
videotape,
they
were
not
coercive,
and
the
fact
that
he
merely
said
something
in
response
that
is
incriminating
in
itself
does
not
mean
that--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--they
explained
every
test
to
him,
and
his
responses--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--that's
correct.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
well,
it
is
not
the
result
of
interrogation,
even
if
it
is
his
testimony.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
well,
i
suppose
it's...
if
it
is
interrogation,
it
is
certainly
fairer
interrogation
than
having
the
test
run
and
then
having
him
complain
that
he
did
not
understand
and
that's
why
he
didn't
do
it,
particularly
in
this
case,
where
spanish
is
in
fact
the
gentleman's
first
language,
english
his
second
language.
it's
certainly
reasonable
for
the
police
to
ask
him,
do
you
understand,
just
as
they
do
when
they
give
him--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--no,
it
is
not
aimed
at
gaining
testimonial
evidence,
again.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
well,
the
result...
if
it
is--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--if
he
expressed
confusion--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--the
result
was
testimonial.
but
the...
it
is
not
interrogation
because
it's
not
designed
to
get
that.
nor
is
it
reasonably
likely
to
get
that.
the
mere
fact
that
intoxicated
people
might
be
more
inclined
to
spill
the
beans
on
themselves
than
a
sober
person
doesn't
give
them
a
greater
or
a
different
rule.
it
doesn't
cause
the
police
to
have
to
be
giving
them
different
warnings
or...
or
rights
than
they
give
the
sober
person.
if
the
burglar
with
a
distinctive
limp
is
made
to
walk
the
line
for
witnesses,
and
the
drunk
is
made
to
walk
the
line
for
all
of
us
on
videotape,
i'd
suggest
the
standard
is
the
same.
and
just
because
the
drunk
is
more
likely
to
say
something
incriminating
during
his
processing
is
not--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--it's...
well,
they
ask
them
to
come
to
the
end,
and
say,
i'm
going
to
indicate
to
you
now
how
i
want
you
to
do
this.
please
stand
there
until
i
show
you.
and
then
the
officer
demonstrates,
with
three
or
four
steps,
how
he
wants
to
do
it.
mr.
muniz,
in
this
case,
kept
talking
during
the
instructions.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
no,
he
didn't
say
that.
[laughter]
he
said
that
at
roadside.
but
in
this
case,
he
indicated
that
he
couldn't
do
it.
he
could
do
it
at
his
home,
but
he
couldn't
do
it
here.
he
couldn't
take
the
test
now,
the
breath
test,
but
he'd
be
happy
to
take
it
in
a
couple
of
hours.
he
said
many
things
that
were
certainly
incriminating.
but
they
weren't
the
response
asked
for
by
the
police,
and
i'd
suggest
it
caused
the
police
to
forego
gathering
legitimate
physical
evidence
because
it's
a
drunk
and
he
might
say
something--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--that's
correct.
but,
again,
if
someone
confesses
during
the
gathering
of
legitimate
testimonial...
or
legitimate
demonstrative
evidence,
i
suggest
there's
no
purpose
served
by
excluding
that
confession
or
incriminating
statement
any
more
than
if
it
was
during
a
lineup
and
he
blurts
out,
during
a
search
warrant
and
he
blurts
it
out
or
routine
sobriety
testing
and
he
blurts
it
out.
i
suggest--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--i
think
the
damage
is
shown
by
the
thompson
case
in
pennsylvania,
one
of
the
superior
court's
line
of
cases,
where
they
did,
in
response
to
the
decision
in
this
case,
give
miranda
warnings
at
the
outset.
the
accused
then
became,
in
the
words
of
the
court,
obscene
and
belligerent
when
he
refused
to
cooperate
with
these
physical
tests,
because
they
had
just
told
him
he
had
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
have
a
lawyer
present.
and
he
didn't
want
to
do
that
without
his
lawyer
present.
he
became
obscene
and
belligerent
and
the
court
ended
up
suppressing
the
entire
tape.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
that's
one
instance
that's
found
its
way
to
the
appellate
courts.
i
suggest
to
you,
where...
where
you
tell
them
you
have
the
right
to
remain
silent
and
have
a
lawyer
present,
you
suspect
them
of
being
intoxicated
in
the
first
place.
to...
to
expect
that
to
do
anything
but
confuse
the
individual
is...
is
just
not
realistic.
it
serves
no
purpose.
it
protects
no
one.
it
does
hamper
the
gathering
of
legitimate
physical
evidence.
and
i
think
would
be
a
totally
intolerable
rule,
given
the
desire
we
all
have--
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
--not
with
the
booking
cases.
we
have
more
than
tripled
our
prosecution
rate
in
conjunction
with
these
centers.
police
are
more
likely
to
cooperate
in
bringing
the
person
in.
the
citizenry
accepts
it.
the
case
is
on
videotape.
and
that's
a
two-edged
sword
sometimes,
but...
but
it's
there.
and
i
think
the
truth-finding
process
is
served
by
it.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
pennsylvania
has
a
per
se
rule
if
the
test
is
over
a.10.
so
if
we
have
the
test,
that
often
resolves
the
case.
not
always,
but
often.
in
this
case
we
had
no
test,
and
everything
else
becomes
the
crux
of
the
case.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
oh,
yes.
yes,
sir.
unless
there
are
other
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remaining
time.
mr.
j.
michael
eakin
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
suggest
that
what
the
court's
being
asked
to
do
by
mr.
maffett
is
to
extend
miranda
to
cover
situations
of
custodial
sobriety
testing
that
it's
not
designed
for,
and
that
instead
of
the
contrary,
trying
to
devise
a
set
of
rights
that
an
intoxicated
suspect
will
understand
that
tells
him
he
has
a
right
to
remain
silent
except
you've
got
to
do
these
tests,
would
be
completely
unworkable.
because
the
tests
are
designed
to
get
physical,
demonstrative
evidence
and
that's
all
they're
designed
to
get,
i
suggest
that
the
present
law
covers
that
and
covers
it
quite
clearly,
and
miranda
warnings
should
not
be
extended
to
apply
to
this
situation.
unless
the
court
has
other
questions,
i'll
forego
the
rest
of
my
time.
