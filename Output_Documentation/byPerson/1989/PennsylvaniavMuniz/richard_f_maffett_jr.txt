mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
a
distinction
must
be
drawn
in
this
case
because
of
the
crime
involved.
driving
under
the
influence
is
a
unique
offense
in
the
sense
that
the
state
of
the
mind
of
the
defendant
is
actually
an
element
of
the
offense.
the
commonwealth
must
prove
for
a
conviction
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
to
a
degree
that
makes
the
person
incapable
of
safe
driving.
"under
the
influence
of
alcohol"
is
defined
by
the
pennsylvania
courts
as
to
include
any
mental
or
physical
condition
as
a
result
of
drinking
that
either
makes
the
person
unfit
to
drive
or
substantially
impairs
judgment,
clearness
of
intellect
or
normal
faculties
essential
for
safe
driving.
and
pennsylvania
courts
have
defined
"substantial
impairment"
to
be
diminution
or
enfeeblement
in
ability
to
exercise
judgment,
to
deliberate
or
to
react
prudently
to
changed
circumstances.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
i
would
define
"testimonial"
as
anything
that
would
disclose
the
contents
of
someone's
mind
either
directly...
either
a
direct
confession
or
the
inferences...
inferences
from
the
words
themselves.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
well,
in
some
circumstances
the
name
and
address
may
not
be
testimonial.
it
may
be
considered...
i
would
submit
it
would
be
testimonial
because
it
discloses
the
contents
of
the
mind.
sometimes
it
would
not
be
interrogation
because
it
would
be
found
to
be
incident
to
normal
arrest
and
custody.
however,
in
the
drunk
driving
situation
where
practically
anything
can
disclose
the
contents
of
the
mind
and
can
be
expected
to
produce
an
incriminating
response
that...
that
then
even
asking
the
name
and
address
without
being...
without
giving
the
miranda
warnings
would
be
considered
interrogation.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
especially
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
your
honor,
because
not
only
had
the
police
officer
obtained
this
information
at
roadside,
but
the
booking
officer
had
obtained
this
information
before
they
went
on
videotape.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
well,
at
roadside--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--at
roadside
he
would
not
yet
be
in
custody,
and
the
very
first
thing
the
officer
normally
does
as
he
begins
his
investigation
would
be
your
name,
address,
driver's
license--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--excuse
me?
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
the
man
was
at
the
side
of
the
road,
and
the
police
officer
stopped,
and
then
he
pulled
off
and
the
officer
stopped
him.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
yes.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
if
he
has
not
yet
been
arrested,
he
wouldn't
be
in
custody,
and
this
court's
decision
in
berkemer
would
control
and--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--is
that
permissible?
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
that's
not
the
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
i
think...
i
think
that
under
some
circumstances
that
could
also
be
testimonial;
if,
for
example,
it
discloses
the
man's
inability
to
follow
instructions.
and
one
of
the
key
parts
of
the...
of
the
coordination
tests,
according
to
the
national
highway
traffic
safety
administration
instructions,
is
one
of
the
key
scoring
points
is
can
this
man
follow
directions.
so
that
if
his
walking
the
straight
line,
if
he
can't
do
that
because
he
can't
follow
the
directions
or
he
can't
remember
the
test,
that,
yes,
that
can
be
testimonial,
also.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
yes.
it
discloses
his
inability
to
reason.
it
discloses
his
inability
to
remember,
his
intellect.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
well,
not
exactly,
and
it's...
it's
hard
to
come
up
with
a
precise
phrase
because
the
other
cases
don't
deal
exactly
with
this
issue.
the
only
issue
that
i
can
see
close
is
the
insanity
situation.
most
other
cases,
how...
whether
or
not
i
can
reason
doesn't
really
come
into
whether
or
not
the
crime
can
be
proven.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
in
those
cases,
the
person
who
is
giving
the
sample
is
not
trying
to
communicate
anything
to
the
person
he's
giving
the
sample
to,
nor
are
the...
are
the
law
enforcement
authorities
attempting
to
get
communication.
they
simply
want
the
physical
aspect,
the
normal
sound
of
the
voice,
the
normal
way
the
handwriting
is
written
so
that
there's
no
communication.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
it
takes
some
brain
activity.
i
think
in
past
decisions
of
this
court,
the
court
has
found
it
to
be
so
minimal
as
to
be
not
considered
because
it's
no
conscious
thought,
and
there's
no...
although
there's
brain
activity,
there's
no
intention
to
communicate.
there's--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--convey.
yes,
i'm
sorry.
there's
no
intention
to
convey
an
idea,
and
the
times
that
samples
like
this
have
been
allowed
has
always
been
a
situation
where
it
was
for
identity,
not
for
elements
of
the
crime.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
that's
right,
and
i
do
not
think
that,
under
my
understanding
of
this
court's
past
decisions,
that
that
would
not
be
permissible
because
that
discloses
rather
than
you
giving
me
a
sentence,
"the
quick
brown
fox
jumps
over
the
log.
"
to
write,
and
i
write
what
you
tell
me
to
write.
if
you
pick
what
you
write
and
you
decide
how
to
spell
it
and
what
you
pick,
then
that
does
disclose
the
mental
thought
process.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
i
would
submit
that's
correct.
both
united
states
v.
wade
and
dionisio
and
gilbert
all
involve
situations
where
the
person
who
gave
the
sample
was
given
something
and
said
write
this,
speak
this.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
it
would
not
because
it
would
involve
his
intellectual
capacity
to
put
the
letters
together,
to
remember
what
comes
after
b.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
except
that
if
he
forgets
how
to
write
the
sentence,
he
can
look
on
the
paper
and
see
it
to
write
it.
in
fact,
there's
a
case,
united
states
v.
campbell,
which
is
the
court
of
appeals...
it's
not
this
circuit...
which
where
the
individual
had
to
spell
the
exemplar,
where
the
exemplar
was
dictated
to
them
but
they
had
to
pick
the
spelling,
that
that
was
found
to
be
testimonial
because
the
person
conveyed
the
contents
of
his
thought
process,
this
is
how
i
spell...
how
i
spell
the
word.
and
so
similarly,
if
you
are
asked
to
recite
the
abcs,
again
that's
not
this
case,
but
if
you're
asked
to
recite
the
abcs
and
you
have
to
pick
what
comes
after
d
and
how
many
letters
are
there,
that
that
discloses
exactly
what
the
fifth
amendment
was
intended
to
protect.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
the...
but
the
function
of
the
mind
is
an
element
of...
of
this
offense,
and
by
asking
the
man
to--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--well,
but
by
asking
the
man
to
calculate
the
date
of
his
sixth
birthday,
unlike
walking
the
straight
line,
he
then
is
disclosing
information
that
incriminates
him
from
his
mouth,
from
his
thought
process
as
opposed
to
his--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--that's
correct,
and
i
would
argue
that
that
is
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment.
this
court
in
estelle
v.
smith,
in
that
case
the
psychiatrist
took
what
the
man
said
to
him
and...
and
decided
that
that
man's
mind
worked
in
such
a
way
that
he
was
dangerous
to
society
and
deserved
the
death
penalty,
and
this--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--yes.
well,
this
case
to
a
certain
extent
has
the...
has
the
same
thing
because
the...
the
inability
to
calculate
the
sixth
birthday
or
to
get
your
age
right
reveals
how
mr.
muniz's
mind
worked,
i
would
submit,
in
similar
fashion.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
i
would
agree,
your
honor,
and
part
of
the
problem
is
that
sometimes
you
have
a
combination
of
testimonial--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--well,
part
of
the
problem
particularly
in
a
situation
where
the
intoxication
is
the
crime,
you
get
a
situation
where
you
have
a
mixture
of
physical
and
testimonial
in
the
same
thing.
you
have
a
mixture
of
the
physical
part
of
the...
the
control
of
the
tongue
with
the
thoughts
of
the
mind,
and
it's...
it's
something
that,
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
you
can't
cut
the
line.
you
can't
exclude
the
testimonial
part.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
i
would
submit
that
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
again,
that's
not
the
situation
here,
but--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--well,
again,
inability
to
walk
a
line...
the
problem
becomes
that
there
are
both
physical
and
testimonial
aspects.
there
are
the
aspects
that
show
the
diminished
ability
to
reason.
and
there
are
aspects
that
show
diminished
ability
to
walk.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
that's--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--is...
is
his
inability
to
do
it,
that
he
doesn't
follow
the--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--does
it
perfect,
but
falls
off
the
line.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
that
would
be
much
closer
to
strictly
physical,
and
so,
would
be...
would
be
permitted.
because
that's...
that's
more
towards
the
exemplar
situation,
where
you
are
looking
at
a
person's
normal
gait,
normal
voice.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
that...
that's
true.
however,
if
he's
walking
the
line,
it
primarily
would
show
his
inability
to
control
his
physical
features.
it
depends--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--that...
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
yes
and...
and
ideas
are
involved
in
this
case.
again,
this
case
doesn't
involve...
we
didn't
challenge
the
physical
coordination
tests.
we're...
we're...
we
merely
challenged
the
responses
that
mr.
muniz
made,
as
far
as
walking
the
straight
line
and
the
one-leg
stand.
we
didn't
make
any
challenge
to
those
items.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
i
think
that
you...
you'd
have
to
go
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
if
it
would--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--well,
if...
because,
if
it's...
you
get
the
combination
of
the
physical
and
testimonial
and
unless...
if
i
think
of
a
specific
instance,
then
i
can
say,
well,
i...
i
believe
this
to
be
physical
or
testimonial.
but
the...
the
ideas...
the...
when
mr.
muniz
tries
to
walk
a
straight
line,
or
when
mr.
muniz
tried
to
answer
these
questions,
he
was
trying
to
convey
the
idea
to
the
booking
center
personnel,
i'm
not
drunk.
i'm...
i'm
all
right.
i
didn't
commit
a
crime.
that's
the
idea
he's
trying
to
convey.
the
commonwealth,
in
trying
to...
to
show
these
things,
is
trying
to
convey
the...
the
impression
he
is
drunk,
he
has
committed
a
crime.
so
that
there
is
an
idea,
even
in
the...
even
when
he
tries
to
walk
the
straight
like,
he...
he's
trying
to
communicate,
i'm
okay.
i...
i
haven't
had
too
much
to
drink.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
well--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--but
with
the
voice...
with
the
voice
exemplar,
again,
the
individual
is
merely
asked
to...
to
repeat
a...
a
phrase
or
a
sentence,
or
whatever
it
is.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
well,
the
exemplar
cases
have
always
been
for
the
identity
of
the
person,
rather
than
the...
the
elements
of
the
crime
itself.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
because
identification
is
not...
the...
the
physical
identification...
as
justice
scalia
said,
the
fifth
amendment...
the
fifth
amendment
protects
the
person
from
being
a
witness
against
themselves.
identification
doesn't
make...
doesn't
normally
make
that
person
a
witness
against
himself.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
but...
but
if
you
identify
me,
that
doesn't
help
you
to
convict
me.
it
helps
you
to
convict
me
in
the
sense
that
you
may
know
who
the
suspect
is.
but
the
police...
the
law
enforcement
authorities
still
must
take
and
develop
their
evidence
on
their
own
and
make
their
case,
as
opposed
to
having
me
participate
in
making
their
case.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
it--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--it...
it
is
a
link
in
the
case,
but...
but
it's
not
the
case.
it...
it,
again,
may
provide
the
identity
of
the
individual.
it
would
have
to--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--well...
and
a
person's
identity
is
always
a
link
in
the
case,
because
even
if
you
have
really
strong
proof,
if
you
don't
have
the...
who
the...
if
you
can't
prove
who
it
was,
you
don't
have
a
case.
but
you
don't
have...
but
identity
doesn't
help
prove
the
elements
of
the
crime.
for...
for
example,
this
court,
in,
i
believe,
california
v.
byers,
said
that
an
individual
had
to
stop...
had
to
stop
after
he
had
an
accident
and
stay
there.
and
he
was...
by
staying
there,
he
was
divulging
his
identity.
but
that
this...
it
didn't
help
the
commonwealth
prove
their
case,
because
they
still
had
to
prove
that
he
had
committed
some
criminal
violation.
there
were
other
parts
to
the
opinion.
i...
i
agree,
but
that's
my
understanding
of
the
difference
between
identity
and...
and
actually
helping
convict
yourself.
the...
there
can
be
no
question
that
calculating
the
sixth
birthday
or
the
other
things
that
mr.
muniz
was
asked
to
do,
again,
show
either
his
ability
to
recall
or
reason
or
his
inability
to
do
that,
and
his
clearness
of
intellect,
judgment
and
mental
state.
the
fact
that...
that
he
didn't
direct...
in
other
words,
that
the
commonwealth
didn't
want
to
use
his...
the
date
of
his
sixth
birthday
for
the
actual
proof
of
when
the
date
of
his
sixth
birthday
is,
is
of
no
moment,
as
this
court
decided
in
estelle
v.
smith.
the
impressions,
inferences,
from
what
was
said
can
be...
can
be
just
as
protected
and
just
as
testimonial
as...
as
the
direct
words.
the...
it
cannot
be
argued
in
this
case
that
any
of
mr.
muniz'
responses
were
voluntary.
the
superior
court
found,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
both
that
the
utterances
were
clearly
compelled,
and
that
none
of
them
were
voluntary.
and
furthermore,
where
a
defendant
is
in
custody
and
he
hasn't
been
given
his
miranda
warnings,
there
is
a
presumption
of
compulsion.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
there
was
a
finding
that
his--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--that...
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
perhaps
i
misspoke.
there
was
a
finding
that
his...
his
comments
were
not...
were
prompted.
in
other
words,
they
were
either
in
response
to
direct
questions
or
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
booking
officer,
not
so
much
that
they
were
compelled
in
that
sense.
but
this
court
has
in
the
past
held
that
where
a
defendant
is
questioned
in
custody
and
without
miranda
warnings,
that
he...
that
there
is
that
presumption
of
compulsion.
this
can...
again,
these...
the...
the
occurrences
in
this
case
can't
be
argued
to
be
tantamount
to
merely
attendant...
normally
attendant
to
arrest
and
custody,
because
it
goes
far
beyond
what
normally
happens,
and
what
this
court
has
found
to
be
attendant
to
arrest
and
custody.
this
is
a
situation
far
beyond
fingerprinting
or
photographing
or
a
blood
or
a
breath
test.
this
was
an
investigative
process.
the...
the
booking
center
process
itself
is
designed
to
gather
evidence.
you
have
a
situation
where
not
only
is
the
defendant
separated
from
the
public,
he's
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
police
department.
only
drunk
driving
suspects
are
taken
to
these
booking
centers.
the
defendant
is
not
asked,
would
you
like
to
take
some
coordination
tests?
he
has
said,
now...
now,
we're
going
to
give
you
some
tests.
would
you
come
over
here?
there
are
lines
painted
on
the
floor.
it
is
well
lit.
the
videotape
and
breath
machines
are
in
place.
he
is
given
these
physical
sobriety
tests
as
part
of
the
investigation.
he's...
the
petitioner,
in
their
brief,
said
that,
as
far
as
the
implied
consent
law,
that
that
was
somehow
to
be
fair
to
the
defendant,
to
make
sure
that
he
understood.
but
pennsylvania
law
currently
is
that
for
a
valid
test
or
a
valid
refusal
to
be
admitted
into
evidence,
they
don't
need
to
show
that
the
defendant
understood
what
he
was
told
about
the
implied
consent
law.
or
that
his
choice
in
either
taking
the
test
or
not
taking
the
test
was
knowing
and
voluntary.
they
merely
have
to
show
that
they
told...
that
it
was
a
legitimate
arrest.
they
asked
him
to
take
the
test.
and
that
they
told
him
what
the
consequences
would
be
if
he
refused.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
no,
i
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
that...
that's
correct.
because
he
was
not
arrested
until
he
was
placed
in
the
police
car
and...
and
actually
placed
under
arrest.
a
case
that
can
be
analogized
to
this
case
was...
was
the
court
of
appeals
case
of
united
states
v.
hinckley.
it
involved
the
assassination
of...
or
attempted
assassination
of
president
reagan.
now
the
fbi
took
mr.
hinckley
in
for
about
20
or
25
minutes,
asked
him
questions
concerning
where
his
parents
lived,
his
address,
did
he
have
girlfriends,
where
did
he
work,
how
far
had
he
gone
in
school,
those
sorts
of
things.
it
was
nothing
even
as
overt
as
this
case,
because
it
didn't
have
directly
to
do
with
the
elements
of
the
offense
that
he
was
charged
with.
but
the
court
found
that
since
the
agents
were
aware
that
there
was
a
likelihood
that
there
would
be
an
insanity
defense,
the
responses
were
inadmissible,
because
it
was
reasonably
likely
to...
or
the...
the
fbi
was
aware
that
there
questions
were
reasonably
likely
to
lead
to
an
incriminating
response.
and
that's
the...
exactly
the
situation
in
this
case,
or
it's
pretty
close.
because
you
have
the
officer
at
roadside
who
has
testified
that
he
observes
odor
of
alcohol,
bloodshot
eyes,
poor
coordination,
trouble
producing
license
and
registration.
in
fact,
he
told
him
to
stay
at
the
side
of
the
road
until
he
sobered
up.
according
to
the
officer,
practically
every
contact
at
the
side
of
the
road
produced
some
sort
of
an
incriminating
response.
and
from
that
point
on,
law
enforcement
certainly
should
have
known
that...
that
whatever
they
asked
mr.
muniz
was
likely
to
illicit
an
incriminating
response.
and
then,
more
of
the
same
at
the
booking
center.
he...
he
can't
even
give
them
his
address.
he
has
to
look
at
his
wallet.
he
gets
his
age
wrong.
this
is
all
before
the
sixth
birthday
question.
is
it
reasonably
likely
to
expect
that
a...
that
a
drunk
driving
suspect
on
being
asked
to
perform
these
field
sobriety
tests,
when
he
can't
do
them,
will
provide
some
sort
of
an
explanation
which
will
end
up
being
incriminating?
if
the
procedure
in
this
case
is
not
construed
by
this
court
to
be
interrogation,
i
would
argue
that
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
would
be
substantially
eroded.
you
can't
expect
a
defendant
who
is
upset
by
the
arrest
itself,
without
counsel,
he
does
not
know
of
his
right
not
to
have
the
conversation,
to
make
a
choice
based
on
the
consequences
of
these
seemingly
innocent
questions
and
instructions.
because
the
questions,
on
their
face,
to
the
defendant,
are...
are
statistical,
and
may
be...
may
seem
to
him
to
be
to
ensure
he
understood,
without
being
told
that
he
has
a
right
to
remain
silent,
or
that
whatever
he
says
might
be
used
against
him,
he
has
no
way
to
know
that
he
doesn't
have
to
answer
and
that
his
responses
may
be
used
later
at
trial
to
convict
him.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
well,
i
think
most
of
the
statements
during
the
testing
were...
again,
he
was
trying
to
show,
to
communicate
that
he
was
not
intoxicated,
because
he
said
things
like,
"i
can't
walk
this
way
even
when
i'm
at
home.
"
or
"i
can't
walk
this
way
even
when
i'm
at
work.
"
"i
can't...
my
legs
are
not
so
good.
"
so
there
were
things
that
he
was
trying
to
explain
why
he
couldn't
do
the
tests
that
they
asked
him
to
do.
in
fact,
on
the
video--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--yes,
it
was.
yes.
at
one
point
on
the
video
he
even
said...
he
was
told,
well,
we'll
read
you
your
miranda
warnings
later,
and
he
said
something
to
the
effect
of,
"i
know
you
people
are
pretty
fair
about
it.
"
i
mean,
he
was
relying
on
them
to
be
fair
with
him
in
their
investigation.
he
had
no
idea
that
what
they
were
doing
was
gathering
evidence,
from
what
he
said,
to
convict
him.
and
this
would
not,
if
you--
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
--he
may
have,
but
as
far
as
his
words,
i
can't
tell
you.
he
wouldn't
know
without
being
told
that...
and
especially
his
statement,
"i
know
you
people
will
be
pretty
fair
about
it.
"
is
an
illustration
that
he
thought
that
something
else
was
going
on,
other
than
getting
evidence.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
i
suppose
that's
another
fair
inference.
this...
if
the
court
were
to
sustain
the
pennsylvania
superior
court
it
would
not
appreciably
affect
the
way
these
booking
procedures
are
done.
the
defendant
can
still
be
asked
his
name
and
his
address
and
any
other
biographical
information
that
they
need,
but
if
they
don't
read
him
his
rights,
they
just
can't
use
that
part
in
evidence,
and
i
would
argue
that
as
far
as
whether
or
not
it
would
make
any
difference
if
you
did
read
the
man
his
rights
at
the
beginning,
that
in
fact
it
would
not.
it's
been
my
practice
in
cumberland
county
since
the
time
of
this
decision
that
now,
in
fact,
they
do
read
him
his
rights
as
soon
as
the
man
comes
to
the
police
station
and
again,
just
from
my
practice,
it
doesn't
make
any...
hasn't
made
any
difference
on
whether
the
people
say
something
or
not.
mr.
richard
f.
maffett,
jr.
they're
very
close.
they're
within...
across
the
river
is
cumberland
county
from
dauphin.
lastly,
the
advantage
of
miranda
has
always
been
its
clarity...
it's
bright
line.
the
police,
the
prosecutors,
the
lower
courts,
know
what
must
be
done
for
questioning
and
under
what
circumstances
statements
are
admissible.
if
you
make
an
exception
to
the
facts
for
this
case,
it's
going
to
lead
to
a
lot
of
litigation.
the
end
result
would
be
an
elaborate
set
of
rules
and
exceptions
and
distinctions,
and
nobody...
not
the
police,
not
the
prosecutors,
not
the
courts...
are
going
to
know
with
any
certainty
as
to
any
particular
situation
whether
or
not
the
interrogation
is
permissible.
if
you
allow
the
kind
of
conduct
or
questioning
or
the
process
that
occurred
here,
you
put
a
premium
on
the
police
devising
these
indirect
interrogation
methods,
these
tricky
things
of
the
sixth
birthday
question
and
other
similar
indirect
questions.
because
the...
what
happened
at
the
booking
center
is
actually...
if...
it
actually
incriminated
and
was
just
as
deadly
to
mr.
muniz
as
if
he'd
have
been
asked,
"are
you
drunk",
if
for
all
intents
and
purposes
his
responses
said,
"i
am
drunk".
and
i
would
argue
that
because
the
utterances
disclosed
the
contents
of
his
mind,
his
reasoning
ability,
that
they
were
testimonial
and
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment,
and
since
he
was
subject
to
interrogation
without
miranda
warnings,
that
the
audio
portion
of
the
videotape
was
correctly
ruled
inadmissible.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i'll
sit
down.
