justice
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
a
second,
mr.
grant?
why
in
godfrey...
what
was
the
standard
that
you
understand
was
applied
to
decide
that
the...
georgia's
narrowing
construction
had
not
been
followed?
i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
the...
what
you're
saying
the
difference
between
godfrey
and
this
case
is.
i'm
not
sure
i...
i...
i
may
have
lost
you.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
as
to
the
second
point...
is
what
i'm
most
interest
in.
justice
stevens
well,
i
thought
the...
i
thought...
i'm...
i...
it's
kind
of
a
confusing
opinion.
but
i
thought
they
in
effect
had
said
that
the...
a
proper
reading
of
the
narrowed
definition
was
not
applied
here.
i'm...
i'm
stating
it
backwards.
that
the
facts
here
don't
fit
the
narrowed
definition.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question,
mr.
grant?
in
the
later
case,
contrary
to
this
one,
the
ninth
circuit
said
the
circumstance
is...
is
void
on
it's
face,
or
something,
didn't
it?
that
it's
too
broad?
justice
stevens
now,
if...
i'm
not
saying
we
should...
but
if
we
should
agree
with...
have
that
same
view,
what
do
we
do
with
this
case?
do
we...
are
we
bound
sort
of
by
the
law
of
the
case
that
we
must
assume
this
is
a
valid
aggravating
circumstance
even
if
we
don't
think
it
is?
justice
stevens
but
it's...
it
would
be
sort
of...
if
this
is
the
sole
aggravating
circumstance
and
if
we're
convinced,
based
on
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
in
the
other
case
that
it's
an
invalid
circumstance,
i
find
it
rather
difficult
to
say
we
should
execute
this
man.
justice
stevens
you
see?
justice
stevens
right.
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
just...
i'm
really...
it's
kind
of
hard
to
divorce
them
completely
in
thinking
about
this.
i'm
just
trying
to
be
candid
with
you.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
well,
assume
they
not
only
ruled
against
you
but
they
thought
it
was
covered
by
godfrey
or
something
like
that
so
it
wasn't
a
new
rule.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
and,
of
course,
you
say
it's
wrong
too.
i
mean,
you
say
this
circumstance
is...
is
proper?
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
but
that
wouldn't
expand
the
relief
for
this
particular
individual.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
he's
either
got...
may
i
ask,
your--
justice
stevens
--yes.
may
i
ask...
your
opponent
in
effect
says
you
never
do
tell
us
what
the
standard
is.
and...
can
you
state
the
standard
and
are
there
any
objective
requirements
for
this
particular
standard?
justice
stevens
is
there
any
one
fact
that
must--
justice
stevens
--well,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
criticizing
you
for
it.
i'm
just
asking
you
are
you
able
to
state
the
standard.
justice
stevens
can
you
tell
us
one...
one
requirement
that
must
be
met?
justice
stevens
i
don't
have
the
gretzler
case
in
front
of
me.
justice
stevens
can
you
state
the
standard?
justice
stevens
now,
is
either
one
of
those...
is
either
one
of
those
sufficient?
justice
stevens
does
that
mean...
we
had
a
case
that
i
was
thinking
about
during
the
argument
in
which
the
murderer
was
upset
about
what
the
victim
had
done
to
his
sister
and
he
participated
in
a
brutal
killing
and
there
was...
when
the
killing
took
place,
he
in
effect
said,
you
got
what
you
deserved.
would
that
satisfy
the
standard?
was
a...
is
a
revenge
killing
always
a
relish
factor?
justice
stevens
what...
what
revenge
killings
would
and
what
would
not
comply
with
the
relish
factor?
justice
stevens
and
is
that
climbing
on
top
to
finish
the
job
off...
is
that
the
gratuitous
violence
where
he--
justice
stevens
--thought
it
was--
justice
stevens
--what?
justice
stevens
what
is
the
gratuitous
violence?
justice
stevens
when
does
it
become
gratuitous
is
what
i'm
trying
to
figure.
justice
stevens
is
it
when
it's
no
longer
necessary
to
kill?
justice
stevens
when
she
did
that
was
the
victim
already
dead?
justice
stevens
i
thought
the
lower
court
said
that
what
happened
after
she
died
didn't
count.
justice
stevens
yeah.
