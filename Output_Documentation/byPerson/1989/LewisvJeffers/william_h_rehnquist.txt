chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-189,
samuel
a.
lewis
v.
jimmy
wayne
jeffers.
mr.
grant,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
suppose
it
would
be
reviewable
under
the
jackson
against
virginia
standard
at...
at
any
rate
if
it
were
argued
that
there
were
no...
no
juror
could
possibly
or
no
court
could
possibly
find
him
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
didn't
the
ninth
circuit
in
reaching
that
conclusion
take
into
consideration
other
arizona
cases
in
which
the
death
penalty
had
not
been
imposed?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
grant.
mr.
liebman,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this...
this
is
the
point
on
which
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
against
your
client?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
did...
it
did
make
one
favorable
ruling
to
the
state.
what
was
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
a-24.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're...
you're
attributing
an
extraordinarily
jesuitical
approach
to
judge
canby,
i
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that...
that
isn't
the
language.
you're...
you're
not
using
the
words
that
you
just
quoted
from.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
capable
of...
it
does
not
answer
the
question
whether
the
arizona
statute
was
constitutionally
applied
to
jeffers
in
this
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i'm
not
sure
we're
not
spending
a
disproportionate
amount
of
time,
considering
each
side
has
half
an
hour,
on
an
interpretation
of
what
the
lower
court
meant.
that's
up
to
you...
not
entirely
up
to
you
because
you
have
to
answer
questions.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
you...
are
you
talking
about
a
case-by-case
analysis
of
each
case
to
see
whether
the
aggravating
circumstance
was...
quote...
constitutional
or
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that's
basically
the
way
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
has
defined
for
state
law
purposes
that
term
in
its
capital
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
you
find
another
adjective
than
heinous
to
modify
by
that
adverb
or--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
liebman.
mr.
grant,
you
have
ten
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
grant.
the
case
is
submitted.
