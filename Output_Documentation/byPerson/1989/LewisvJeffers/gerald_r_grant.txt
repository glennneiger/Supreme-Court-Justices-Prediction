mr.
gerald
r.
grant
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
capital
case
is
what
standard
of
review
should
a
federal
habeas
court
apply
in
reviewing
a
state
court's
finding
that
an
aggravating
circumstance
exists.
it's
our
position
that
once
the
federal
habeas
court
has
examined
the
aggravating
circumstance
and
determined
that
the
state
court
has
adopted
a
proper
narrowing
construction
of
it,
that
the
state
court
finding
that
the
aggravating
circumstance
exists
is
not
generally
subject
to
federal
review.
only
in
those
instances
where
the
finding
is
so
unprincipled
or
arbitrary
as
to
somehow
violate
the
constitution
should
that
finding
be
reviewed
by
a
federal
habeas
court.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
that's
an
additional
standard
that
the
dissent
in
the
ninth
circuit
recognized.
it's
also
a
standard
we've
mentioned
in
our
briefs.
however,
our
one
problem
with
that
is
that
we
do
not,
and
this
court
has
not,
equated
aggravating
circumstances
with
findings
of
guilt.
the
jackson
standard
does
apply
to
standard
of
guilts...
findings
of
guilt,
and
for
that
reason
we
would
prefer
the
standard
stated
in
barclay
which
is
the...
so
unprincipled
or
arbitrary.
briefly,
in
this
case
the
arizona
trial
court
found
two
aggravating
circumstances
in
mr.
jeffers'
case.
he
found
that
in
committing
the
murder
he
created
a
grave
risk
of
death
to
others.
he
also
found
that
the
murder
was
committed
in
an
especially
heinous,
cruel
or
depraved
fashion.
in
the
arizona
state
supreme
court's
independent
review
of
this
case,
it
set
aside
the
first
aggravating
circumstance,
the
grave
risk
of
death.
and
with
regard
to
the
second,
it
set
aside
the
cruelty
portion
of
it.
it
found
that
cruelty
had
not
been
shown
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it,
however,
affirmed
the
finding
that
he
had
committed
the
murder
in
an
especially
heinous
and...
and
depraved
fashion.
mr.
jeffers
then
petitioned
for
cert.
to
this
court.
cert.
was
denied.
he
then
subsequently
filed
a
federal
habeas
corpus
petition.
in
that
petition
he
made
a
number
of
attacks
on
his...
on
his
sentencing.
two
of
those
attacks
were
that
the
cruel,
heinous
or
depraved
aggravating
circumstance
was
void
on
its
face,
and,
secondly,
that
it
was
void
as
applied
to
him.
the
district
court
ruled
against
him
on
both.
he
then
went
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit...
with
regard
to
the
first
question,
the
ninth
circuit,
relying
on
its
prior
decision
in
chaney,
found
that
the
circumstance
was
not
void
on
its
face.
it
then
went
on
to
address
the
question
he
had
presented,
essentially
that
it
was
void
as
applied
to
him.
the
ninth
circuit
concluded,
after
reviewing
some
arizona
cases,
that
the
evidence
presented
did
not
meet
arizona's
definition
of
cruel,
heinous
or
depraved,
the
narrowing
decision...
the
narrowing
construction
that
they
had
previously
found
had
been
made
by
the
arizona
supreme
court.
it's
our
position
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
essentially
did,
and
what
respondent
is
asking
this
court
to
do,
is
to
allow
federal
habeas
courts
to
act
as
a
third
sentencer.
our
position
that's
not
the...
not
the
responsibility--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--my
interpretation
of
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
was
they
first
looked
at
arizona's
definition
of
cruel,
heinous
or
depraved.
they
said,
yes,
this
is
properly
narrowed.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
they
then
looked
at
the
facts
and
they
accepted
the
facts...
the
historical
facts--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--concerning
what
mr.
jeffers
had
done.
they
accepted
those
as
correct.
they
then
made
their
own
determination
of
whether
those
facts
met
the
standard.
in
essence,
what
they
did
was
resentence
mr.
jeffers.
they
made
their
own
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
these
factors...
this
evidence,
excuse
me,
met
the
definition
of
the
factor.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
they
looked
at...
they
looked
at
six
cases.
essentially
they
all
dealt
with
the
cruel,
heinous
or
depraved
circumstance,
and
i
believe
four
of
them...
four
of
the
decisions
were
ones
in
which
the
state
supreme
court
had
found
that
the
circumstance
did
not
apply.
again...
and
essentially
what
they
did,
besides
acting
as
a
third
level
of
sentencer,
was
to
conduct
a
proportionality
review.
they
compared
this
case
with
various
other
arizona
cases.
our
position
is
that
under
pulley
versus
harris
that
sort
of
proportionality
review
is
not
constitutionally
required
and
it
should
not
have
been
done.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
my
position
is
that...
is
that
once
the
determination
has
been
made
that
the
circumstance
has
been
narrowly
defined.
the
actual
finding
that
the
circumstance
exists
is
not
subject
to
federal
review
unless
that
finding
is
simply
so
unprincipled
or
arbitrary
as
to
somehow
violate
the
constitution.
and
that
test
i
take
from
the
plurality
opinion
in
barclay.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
barclay,
barclay
versus
florida.
our
basic
position
is
that
since
furman
this
court's
consideration
in
death
penalty
cases
has
been
that
states
should
narrow
the
class
of
people
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
and
that
this
court...
and
that
state
courts
should
guide
and
minimize,
but
not
eliminate,
the
discretion
of
the
sentencing
authority.
the
two
main
decisions
that
i
think
are
relevant
here
from
this
court
are
godfrey
and
maynard.
neither
of
those
support
the
action
taken
by
the
ninth
circuit.
neither
of
those
dictate
the
result
that
the
respondent
would
like
from
this
court.
the
problem
in
godfrey
and
what
caused
this
court
to
reverse
godfrey's
death
sentence
was
not
that
this
court
found
that
godfrey's
conduct
was
somehow
less
atrocious...
i
believe
was
the
language
in
godfrey...
than
that
of
other
people
in
georgia.
the
problem
in
godfrey
was
that
georgia
had
adopted
a
narrowing
construction
of
their
aggravating
circumstance,
which
is
similar
to
arizona's.
i
believe
they
used
the
word
atrocious
rather
than...
than
heinous
and
depraved.
this
court
recognized
that...
that
georgia
had
done
that,
they
had
adopted
a
narrowing
construction.
the
problem
with
godfrey,
however,
was
that
the
jury
who
sentenced
mr.
godfrey
was
not
instructed
in
accordance
with
that
narrowing
definition,
and,
therefore,
their
finding
that
the
circumstance
existed
was
subject
to
uncontrolled
discretion.
and,
secondly,
on
review
by
the
state
supreme
court
of
georgia,
the
state
supreme
court
also
failed
to
apply
their
own
narrowing
construction
of
the
aggravating
circumstance.
because
of
those
two
things,
this
court
concluded
that
the
danger
of
excessive
discretion
in
an
unchanneled
sentencing
decision
was
too
great
and
therefore
reversed
mr.
godfrey's
death
sentence.
in
maynard,
which
followed
godfrey,
the
problem
again
was
not...
or,
the
reason
for
the
holding
was
not
that
mr.
maynard's
conduct
was
somehow
less
atrocious
or
less
heinous
than
that
of
anyone
else
in
oklahoma.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
well,
i
think
the
difference
is,
simply
by
looking
at
the
record
this
court
could
determine,
number
one,
that
the
jury
who
sentenced
godfrey
were
not
instructed
on
the
meaning,
the
narrowing
construction--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--of
the
meaning
of
the
aggravating
circumstance.
there
wasn't
any
instruction
to
the
jury.
secondly,
this
court
could
determine
by
reviewing
the
georgia
supreme
court's
review
of
mr.
godfrey's
situation,
that
the
georgia
supreme
court
had
not
adopted...
or,
had
not
applied
that
definition.
the
distinction
here
is
that,
first
of
all,
we
have
judge
sentencing
in
arizona,
not
jury
sentencing.
the
judge
is
presumed
to
know
the
law.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
as
to
the
second
point,
you
can
look
at
the
arizona
state
supreme
court's
opinion
and
you
can
see...
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
at,
i
believe,
page
69
and
following...
that
they
refer
to
the
narrow
definition
and
they
then
proceed
to
apply
it
to
mr.
jeffers'
case.
the
only...
the
difference
here
is
that
the
federal
court
went
beyond
those
questions,
whether
or
not
there
is
a
definition,
whether
or
not
the
definition
is
narrow,
and
whether
or
not
the
definition
was
applied
by
the
state
supreme
court.
those
are
the
considerations
that
this
court
talked
about
in
godfrey
and
maynard.
it
went
beyond
those
three
and
essentially
substituted
its
own
judgment
as
to
what
the
appropriate
sentence
should
be.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
think
that's
what
they
said.
but
i
think
the
effect
of
that
is
we've
looked
at
these
facts
and
we
don't
think
this
murder
is
especially
heinous
and
depraved.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
correct.
they
said...
they
acknowledged
that
arizona
had
applied
the
definition.
they
simply
disagreed
with
the
result
that
arizona
had
reached
in
applying
that
definition.
it's
our
position
that
that
final
step,
disagreeing
with
the
result,
is
not
a
federal
question
subject
to
review
in
habeas
cases
unless
that
finding
is
somehow
so
unprincipled
or
arbitrary.
respondent's
position
and,
by
extension,
that
taken
by
the
ninth
circuit,
essentially
would
open
almost
every
step
of
a
state
court's
sentencing
process
in
capital
cases
to
federal
review.
there
is
no
logical
reason
why
respondent's
position
and
that
taken
by
the
ninth
circuit
could
not
be
extended
to
allow
a
federal
habeas
court
to
in
effect
find
mitigation
that
the
state
court
had
rejected,
to
allow
a
federal
court
to
in
effect
find
that
mitigation,
which
the
state
court
had
found
was
insubstantial
and
insufficient,
was
substantial
to
call
for
a
leniency,
was
indeed
sufficiently
substantial
to
call
for
a
leniency.
all
of
these
things,
the
state
would
submit,
are
simply
beyond
the
power
of
the
federal
habeas
court
and
are
things
that
the
federal
court
should
not
be
doing.
respondent's
position
also
asks
this
court
to...
and
their
answering
brief
demonstrates
that
fairly
well...
wants
this
court
to
conduct
a
wide
ranging,
case-by-case
comparison
of
arizona
cases
and
in
effect
any
other
state.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
don't
have
a
major
problem
with
the
jackson
standard.
my
only
problem
is
the
reservation
that
aggravating
circumstances
are
not
equated
with
the
finding
of
guilt.
i
certainly
think
the--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--in
a
jackson-type
standard--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--to
a
certain
extent
we're...
we're
discussing
semantics.
i
think
the
jackson
standard
and
this...
and
this
principle...
unprincipled
or
arbitrary
standard
could
be
read--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
jackson
standard
is...
is
something...
as
long
as
the
distinction
between
aggravation
and
finding
of
guilt
is
maintained,
i
think
the
jackson
standard
is
appropriate
because
it
pays
deference
to
the
state
court
finding,
which
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
did
not
do
under
any
standard.
my
position
is
that
the
barclay
standard
would
perhaps
pay
a
little
more--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
disagree
with
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
in
that
respect.
i
think...
again,
the
ninth
circuit
was
presented
with
two
questions.
the
circumstance
is
overbroad
on
its
face.
when
it
dealt
with
that
question,
it--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--resolved
it
against--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--petitioner.
it
then
went
on
to...
to
discuss
whether
or
not
it
was
applied
properly
here.
i
mean,
that...
on
that
question,
it
ruled
against
the
state.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
don't...
i
don't
think
they
went
that
far.
i
think
all
they
said
was
under
these
facts...
these
facts
cannot
be
plugged
into
that
definition
and
maintain
a
narrowing
construction
as
to
mr.
jeffers.
i
don't
think
they
related
it
back
to
the
first
question
and...
and
somehow
undermined
what
they
had
done
with
respect
to
that.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
yes.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
well,
my
first
answer
would
be
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case,
although
respondent
disagrees
with
me.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
well,
my
second
response--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--then
would
be,
first
of
all,
that
issue
is
before
this
court
in
walton,
which--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--assuming...
assuming
the
court
ruled
against
the
state's
position
in
walton--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--the
question
would
then
become
under
teague
and
penry
whether
or
not
that
rule,
whatever
rule
it
is
that
the
court
adopts,--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--if
it
is
not
a
new
rule
under
the
penry
and
teague
analysis,
it
could
be
applied
to
this
case.
my
position
would
be
that
it
is
a
new
rule,--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--it's
not
dictated
by
maynard
and
it's
not
dictated
by
godfrey.
it
goes
beyond
what
two...
two
cases
authorize.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
correct.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
but
assuming,
as
your
hypothetical
was--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--that...
that
this
court
were
to
rule
against
us
on
that
point,
that
would
be
my
response.
my
position
is
that
indeed
arizona
has
adopted
a
narrowing
construction
of
the--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--of
the
circumstance.
getting
back
to
the
comments
i
made
regarding
this
court's
general
holding
since
furman,
the
need
for
narrowing
the
class
and
restricting
sentencing
discretion
in
capital
cases,
i
think
if
you
examine
the
arizona
sentencing
scheme,
you'll
see
that
arizona
has
done
just
that.
first
of
all,
arizona
provides
for
sentencing
by
a
judge,
rather
than
by
a
jury,
which
this
court
has
noted
on
some
occasions
should
provide
for
more
consistent
reasoned
application
of
the
death
penalty.
arizona
also
requires
the
sentencing
judge
to
make
written
findings
to
file
a
special
verdict
so
that
the
appellate
court
can
review
what
it
is
that
the...
that
the
trial
court
based
its
death
sentencing
decision
on.
arizona
also
requires
that
the
aggravating
circumstance
which
qualify
a
defendant
for
the
death
penalty
must
be
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
arizona
further
provides
for
automatic
appeal
in
every
death
penalty
case.
the
arizona
supreme
court
conducts
an
independent
review
of
the
evidence
concerning
both
aggravation
and
mitigation.
it
does
not
defer
to
the
trial
court's
finding;
it
makes
its
own
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
the
evidence
is
sufficient
to
meet
the
aggravating
circumstance
or
the
mitigating
circumstance.
and,
also,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
the
arizona
supreme
court
conducts
a
proportionality
review
in
which
it
compares
the
sentence
imposed
in
the
case
before
it
with
those
in
other
cases.
that
proportionality
review
is
done
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
not
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
as
pulley
makes
clear,
one
problem
with
that
sort
of
proportionality
review
being
done
by
a
federal
court
is
that
the
federal
court...
this
court
or
any
other
federal
court...
is
not
going
to
have
the
same
access
to
the
record
in
the
other
death
penalty
cases
from
the
state
that
the
arizona
supreme
court
will.
the
arizona
supreme
court
will
have
those
records
before
it,
will
have
the
transcripts,
will
have
the
sentencing
decisions,
and
can
make
a
much
more
informed
and
complete
analysis
than
a
federal
court
could
do
attempting
to
make
a
proportionality
review.
with
respect
to
what
happened
in
this
case,
our
position
is
that
the
standard
applied
is
a
constitutionally
narrow
one,
that
the
facts
fit
plainly
within
that
definition,
and
in
fact
fit
within
the
core
of
that
definition.
it's
our
position
that
the
ninth
circuit,
instead
of
acting
as
a
federal
reviewing
court,
essentially
acted
as
another
sentencing
court.
in
doing
so,
it
exceeded
its
authority
and
this
court
should
correct
the
mistake,
set
aside
that
finding
by
the
ninth
circuit,
and
reinstate
the
death
penalty
for
mr.
jeffers.
unless
the
court
has
additional
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
thank
you,
your
honor.
respondent
here
in
his
argument,
as
he
has
done
in
his
answering
brief,
essentially
is
attempting
to
resurrect
an
issue
the
ninth
circuit
decided
against
him
that
he
failed
to
ask
the
ninth
circuit
to
rehear
and
that
he
failed
to
cross-petition
for
cert.
on
in
this
case.
going
back
to
the
ninth
circuit,
there
were
two
arguments
raised
by
respondent
there.
one,
that
(f)(6),
the
cruel,
heinous
or
depraved
aggravating
circumstance
was
unconstitutionally
vague
on
its
face.
the
second,
that
it
was
unconstitutionally
vague
as
applied
to
him.
i
think
those
two
questions
can
be
more
accurately
phrased
in
the
following
manner.
one,
arizona
has
not
adopted
a
narrowing
construction
of
the
cruel,
heinous
or
depraved
aggravating
circumstance.
that
is
his,
on-its-face
argument.
the
as
applied
argument
essentially
is...
what
it
boils
down
to
is
the
evidence
here
doesn't
support
the
finding.
i
think
it's
plain
that
if
you
look
at
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
here,
that
they
ruled
against
respondent
on
the
first
question...
again,
page
a-24
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
cert...
"his
argument
that
the
statute
is
void
on
its
face
is
foreclosed
by
our
decision
in
chaney.
"
if
you
look
at
what
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
chaney,
which
is
801
f.
2d
1191
at
page
1195,
they
stated...
first
of
all,
they
said...
they
said
what
mr.
chaney
was
claiming,
which
is
the
exact
same
thing
that
mr.
jeffers
was
claiming
in
the
ninth
circuit.
he
was
challenging
(f)(6)
on
its
face
and
in
its
application.
the
ninth
circuit
went
on
to
state
in
chaney,
which
is
the
decision
that
in
jeffers
the
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
found
foreclosed
that
first
question...
they
stated,
"the
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
on
is
face.
"
"although
the
statutory
language
is
broad,
as
any
murder
could
be
considered
cruel,
heinous
or
depraved,
the
arizona
supreme
court
need
not
construe
the
statute
openendedly.
"
they
then
went
on
to
say...
and
this
is
all
at
page
1195
of
the
chaney
decision...
"the
arizona
supreme
court
appears
to
have
sufficiently
channeled
sentencing
discretion
to
prevent
arbitrary
and
capricious
capital
sentencing
decisions.
"
"the
court
has
defined
each
of
the
factors
set
forth
in
section
13-703(f)(6).
"
which
is
the
cruel,
heinous
or
depraved.
they
then
cited
gretzler
and
referred
to
the
gretzler
definitions.
and
they
went
on
to
say...
and
this
sentence
is
left
out
of
the
decision
in
adamson
at
page
1038,
which
respondent
referred
to...
this
sentence
is
left
out
of
that
decision.
"these
definitions
have
been
applied
consistently.
"
that
was
the
holding
in
chaney.
that
is
why
in
jeffers
the
panel
of
the
ninth
circuit
found
that
that
on
its
face
issue
was
foreclosed.
it
was
decided
against
respondent.
he
did
not
move
for
a
hearing.
in
fact,
in
response
to
our
petition
for
a
hearing
on
the
second
issue...
the
as
applied
issue...
and
this
is
in
his
response
to
petition
for
a
hearing
with
suggestion
for
a
hearing
en
banc
at
page
4...
respondent
acknowledged
that
that
first
issue
had
been
decided
against
him.
in
effect,
he
argued
that
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
here
was
really
not
a
significant
one,
it
did
not
throw
out
the
entire
(f)(6)
circumstance.
he
acknowledged
that
it
had
been
decided
against
him.
it's
our
position,
plainly,
that
that
issue
is
not
before
this
court.
the
only
issue
before
this
court
is
the
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
type
claim,
the
on
its...
what
he
terms
the
on
its
face
claim.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
he
won
below
on
the
second
issue.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
would
have
two
responses
to
that.
one
would
be
rule...
this
court's
rule
14.1(a)
which
states
that
the
statement
of
any
question
presented
will
be
deemed
to
comprise
every
subsidiary
question
fairly
included
therein.
my
response
would
be
the
as
applied
question
is
included
within
the
on
its
face
question,
not
vice
versa.
if
we
were
here
on
the...
on
the
as
applied,
or
the
narrowing
construction
issue,
we
could
get
to
the
second
issue.
but
we're
here
only
on
the
second
issue
and,
therefore,
we
can't
get
to
the
first.
it's
not
included
therein.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
my
second
response
would
be...
and
the
name
of
the
case
doesn't
jump
to
my
mind
at
the
moment,
but
it's
cited
in
the
answering
brief...
essentially
respondent's
position
is
that
he
can
defend
the
judgment
below
on
any
grounds
available
to
him.
the
logic
of
that
would...
would
to
me
mean
that
he
can
defend
it
on
any
of
the
sentencing
attacks
that
he
made
below,
which
were
decided
against
him,
and
even
those
which
were
not
decided.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
rule
on
all
of
its
sentencing
attacks.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
well,
my
second
response
then
would
be
he
can...
and,
according
to
that
case
which
he
cited
in
his
brief,
he
can
decide
it...
he
can
defend
it
on
that
ground
so
long
as
it
does
not
expand
the
relief.
if
you
get
to
that
first
question.
my
position
is
that
it
expands
the
relief.
the
relief
granted
in
this
case
was
that
mr.
jeffers'
death
penalty
was
set
aside.
if
you
get
to
the
first
question,
the
on
its
face
of
the
narrowing
construction,
it
would
expand
the
relief
by
essentially
throwing
out
the
entire
(f)(6)
circumstance,
which
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
do
here.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
correct.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
it
would
expand
it
for
other
cases
because
the
ninth
circuit
would
apply
it
there.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
well--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--first,
as
to
why
i
didn't
state
the
standard.
number
one
is
because
it
is
not
within
the...
within
the
question
presented.
our...
our
position
is--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--well,
i
think
the
standard
is--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
think
the
standard
is
stated
in
the
gretzler
case,
which
i
referred
to
in
my
reply
brief.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
the
first
two--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--the
first
two
examples,
as
mr.
liebman
stated,
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
essentially
first
looked
to
the
dictionary
definitions
of
the
terms.
it
then
went
on
in
the
gretzler
case
to
provide
a
number
of
examples.
the
first
two
of
those
are
relishing
the
murder
and
excessive
or
gratuitous
violence.
and
our
position
is
that
under
the
evidence
presented
here
mr.
jeffers--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
think
yes.
i
think--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--i
don't
think
it
is
always,
but
i
think
what
you
have
here
went
beyond
a
simple
statement
of
you
got
what
you
deserved.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
i
would
think
a
situation
where
the
defendant
after
injecting
his
victim
with
heroin,
an
overdose
of
heroin,
and
finding
that
that
wasn't
sufficient
to
kill
her,
after
he
makes
statements
to
another
person
in
the
room
that
he's
given
her
enough
heroin
to
kill
a
horse
and
that
the
bitch
won't
die,
where
he
then
climbs
on
top
of
the
victim,
who
is
unconscious
lying
on
a
bed--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--that's
getting
to
it.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
that's
getting
to
it.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
we're
not
there
yet.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
the
gratuitous
violence...
he
then,
after
climbing
on
top
of
her,
choked
her
with
a
belt.
when
that
wasn't
sufficient,
he
choked
her
with
his
hands.
he
then--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--at
that
stage.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
at
that
stage
he
eventually
he...
i
believe
at
that
point
the
evidence
shows
that
ms.
chaney
was
dead.
he
then
forced
doris
van
der
veer,
who
was
also
present,
to
get
on
top
of
her...
of
the
victim
herself,
inject
her
with
additional
heroin
and
he
photographed
her
while
doing
so.
he
then
got
back
up
on
top
of--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--yes.
he
then
got
back
on
top
of
ms.
chaney
himself
and
began
striking
her
in
the
face,
which
caused
bleeding,
according
to
the
evidence.
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
the
lower
court
only
stated
that
with
respect
to
ms.
jeffers'
conduct
in
disposing
of
the
body
three
days
later.
it
did
not
state
that
with
respect
to
the...
to
the
conduct
that
he
engaged
in
right
at
the
time
and
immediately
after
death.
and
what
he
did,
as
he
was
striking
her
in
the
face,
was
to
state,
"this
one
is
for",
and
he
named
a
number
of
names--
mr.
gerald
r.
grant
--of
people
who
he
felt
that
ms.
chaney
had
informed
on.
i
think
that
sort
of
conduct
clearly
falls
within
those
first
two
gretzler
definitions,
which
i
submit
would
be
the
core
of
the
gretzler
definitions.
respondent's
basic
position
with
respect
to
the
adamson-type
issue
is
that
the
only
definition
that
can
be
upheld
is
that
which
allows
for
no
discretion.
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
stated
that.
and
in...
in
pulley
it's
plainly
stated
that
in
state
capital
sentencing
procedures
there
will
be
some
anomalies.
but
so
long
as
the
discretion
is
limited
to
a
constitutional
extent,
the
sentencing
scheme
will
survive.
additionally,
mr.
liebman
referred...
again,
getting
back
to
that
type
of
gretzler
definition...
he
attempted
to
tie
it
to
a
finding
of
torture
and
in
effect
stated
that
if...
if
we
could
tie
it
to
that,
that
would
be
sufficient.
i
think
this
court
rejected
specifically
that
type
of
argument
in
maynard.
this
court
stated
in
maynard
that
we
are
not
stating
that
merely
because...
merely
tying
it
to
such
a
finding
as
torture
would
be
the
only
constitutionally
sufficient
way
in
which
it
could
be
defined.
thank
you,
your
honors.
