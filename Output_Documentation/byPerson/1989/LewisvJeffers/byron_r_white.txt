justice
white
what
do
you
think
its
holding
was
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
white
uh-huh.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
under
the
narrow
definition?
justice
white
well,
tell
me...
tell
me
again
why...
why
a...
why
you
think
that
the
jackson-type
review
to
a...
where...
where
it's
been
found
either
in
the
trial
court
or
the...
by
the
appellate
court
that
an
aggravating
circumstance
exists.
now,
that
means
you
know
what
the
aggravating
circumstance
is
defined
as
and
if
it...
it's
an
application
of
that
definition
of
the
facts.
justice
white
well,
that's
true.
justice
white
well,
what's...
what's
the
difference
between
the
jackson-type
standard
and
what
you're
promoting?
justice
white
because
a
lot
of
people...
a
lot
of
people,
including
some
maybe
around
here,
thought
there
was
going
to
be
a
terrific
terrible
result
from
jackson.
but
that
hasn't
proved
to
be
the
case,
has
it?
justice
white
i
thought
the
court
went
on
to
say
that
because
the...
because
on
these
facts
the
circumstance
doesn't
exist...
i
thought
they
concluded
that
the
circumstance
therefore,
as
defined,
wasn't...
wasn't
sufficiently...
well,
it
wasn't...
as
applied
in
the
courts,
it
was
sort
of
a
crazy
quit.
it
was
just...
you
could...
it
was...
it
was
just
an
arbitrary
system.
justice
white
it
said
no.
justice
white
yeah.
justice
white
and
i
thought
it...
i
meant
to
say
that
if
the
arizona
court
thought
that
on
these
facts
that
circumstance
existed,
the
whole
system...
or,
that
whole
aggravating
circumstance
wasn't
adequate
to
avoid
an
arbitrary
system.
justice
white
well,
yes,
but
on
a-25
it
says
that...
it
says
that
in
chaney
the
court
held
that...
"the
arizona
supreme
court
appears
to
have
sufficiently
channeled
sentencing
discretion
to
prevent
arbitrary
and
capricious
capital
sentencing
decisions.
"
justice
white
we
stated
in
chaney
that--
justice
white
--uh-huh.
justice
white
was
that
the
same
panel?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be
a
later
interpretation
of
what
they
thought
they
said
in
chaney,
but
we're...
we're
reviewing
this
case.
justice
white
we're
reviewing
this
case.
justice
white
well,
what
if...
what
if
the...
the...
what
if
the
court
says
here
is
a
series
of
things
that
will
show
that
something
is
depraved...
that
the
killing
was
depraved.
but
there
could
be
a
lot
of
other
circumstances.
and
it
turns
in
out
in
a
lot
of
cases
there
are
a
lot
of
other
circumstances.
but
in
this
particular
case
suppose
the
court
says,
here
is
why
this
is
depraved...
a,
b...
and
they
apply
this
open-ended
definition
as
though
it
had
a
closed-in.
justice
white
and
in
application
here
is...
so,
shouldn't
the
question
be
whether
the
factors
that
they
used
in
concluding
that
this
was
a
depraved
murder
are
valid?
justice
white
well,
i
asked
you
the
question--
justice
white
--yes?
justice
white
well,
you
might...
you
might
say
that
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
cases
that
this
definition
they're
applying
is
just
sort
of...
all
it
amounts
to
is
saying
especially
depraved.
justice
white
that's
what
kind
of
an
argument
you
make.
but
in
my
example
if
they
said
a,
b,
and...
there's
no
question
that
that
would
indicate
depravity.
justice
white
yeah.
right.
justice
white
yes.
but
not
here?
justice
white
well,
i
know.
but
he's
a
respondent.
why
can't
he
defend
the
judgment,
as
justice
blackmun
asks?
justice
white
yeah,
but
at
least
he
can
defend
it
on
a...
on
a
ground
that
was
raised
below
and
it
was
decided
against
him.
