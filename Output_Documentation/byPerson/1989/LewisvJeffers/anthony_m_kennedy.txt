justice
kennedy
if...
if
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
had
in
effect
said
exactly
what
the
ninth
circuit
said,
i
take
it
we'd
have
jurisdiction
on
direct
review
to
reverse
them
under
your
theory?
justice
kennedy
let's
say...
let's
say
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
was
really
written
by
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
in
this
case,
i
take
it
under
your
theory
we'd
have
jurisdiction
on
direct
review
if...
assuming
we
granted
cert....
to
reverse
them.
justice
kennedy
you
have
to
say
to
say
that
for
your
theory
of
the
case,
i
take
it.
justice
kennedy
well,
i'll
look
at
the
case
again.
i...
i
had
thought
that
the
ninth
circuit
accepted
the
statute
as
setting
forth
a
proper
standard
and
accepted
the
cases
as
setting
forth
the
proper
standard
but
said
that
they...
that
they
can't
be
applied
here.
justice
kennedy
fine.
justice
kennedy
where
are
you
reading?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
want
you
to
get
there,
but
jut
before
you
do...
in
other
words,
you're
going
to
interpret
that
as
saying
we
imposed
a
sentence
on
chaney
under
a
statute
that
was
not
constitutional?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
still
don't
see
how
you're
helped
because
i
think
you're
going
to
go
to
a...
the
first
paragraph
on
a-26.
justice
kennedy
isn't
that
where
you
were
going
to
take
us
on
this
same
point?
justice
kennedy
applied
to
jeffers
in
this
case.
