mr.
james
s.
liebman
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issues
in
this
case
have
narrowed
considerably
as
a
result
of
the
briefing
and
particularly
the
argument
here.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
clear
that
both
parties
agree
that
there
are
two
questions,
constitutional
questions,
that
the
court
has
to
address
in
a
case
such
a
this
one,
and
it's
also
clear
that
the
parties
agree
on
the
standards
that
apply
to
both
of
those
two
questions.
what
they
disagree
about
is
the
answer
to
the
first
of
those
questions.
the
first
question
is
whether
or
not
arizona's
definition...
arizona
has
a
definition
of
its
especially
heinous
and
depraved
aggravating
circumstance
that
satisfied
the
eighth
amendment
rule
of
furman
versus
georgia,
that
it
narrowed
the
class
of
death-eligible
first-degree
murderers
on
the
basis
of
an
objective
principle.
that
question
entails
an
inquiry,
as
in
both
godfrey
and
maynard,
into
first
whether
or
not
the
state
has
defined
its
aggravating
circumstance
in
a
constitutional
manner,
and,
secondly,
whether
it
has
applied
a
constitutional
definition
in
the
particular
case.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
no,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
rule
against
mr.
jeffers
on
either
of
those
aspects
of
the
maynard
and
godfrey
rule.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
that
ruling
was
that
the
statute...
and
it
says
statute
repeatedly...
the
statute
on
its
face
was
not
unconstitutional,
and
it
cites
gregg.
that's
exactly
the
ruling
this
court
made
in
gregg,
which
was
that
the
reason
the
statute
isn't
unconstitutional
on
its
face
is
it
is,
as
the
ninth
circuit
said,
capable
of
constitutional
definition
and
application.
the
question
it
set
aside
was
are
we
going
to
throw
out
the
arizona
statute
lock,
stock
and
barrel?
and
it
said
no,
we're
going
to
see
if
in
the
definition
of
that
statute
and
in
the
application
of
that
statute
it
was
rendered
constitutional
before
we're
going
to
throw
the
whole
thing
out.
and
it
concluded
that
it
was
not
constitutional.
the
state
has
said
that
that
narrowing
requirement
is
met.
in
fact,
the
state
began
its
argument
by
saying
once
the
state
has
adopted
a
proper
narrowing
construction...
that's
the
critical
premise...
then
you
go
on
to
its
second
question.
well,
we
are
challenging
that
premise,
and
the
reason
we
challenge
that
premise
is
that
the
state
has
never
told
us
what
the
narrowing
principle
is.
there
is
no
statement
of
that
in
the
state's
briefs
and
the
state
did
not
make
that
statement
during
the
course
of
its
argument.
we
don't
know
what
that
narrowing
principle
is,
and
it's
the
absence
of
that
principle
that
renders
the
arizona
definition
as
applied
in
this
case
unconstitutional.
and
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--if
the
supreme
court
of
arizona
said--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--absolutely,
because
it
would
have
been
decided
on
the--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--yes,
but
i
think
that
there's
no
question
but
that
what
the
ninth
circuit
intended
to
do
here
was
to
extract
a
standard.
if
you
look
at
footnotes
9
and
10
and
the
text
accompanying
them
in
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
very
clearly
says
over
and
over
again
what
we're
doing
in
this
case
is
trying
to
extract
a
standard
and
then
looking
at
the
constitutionality
of
that
standard.
if
arizona
had
done
the
same
thing,
said,
well,
here's
our
standard,
we
decide
that
it's
constitutional
or
we
decide
that
it's
unconstitutional,
this
court
could
review
it
because
the
federal
question
would
be
preserved
in
the
case
and
would
be
available
for
review
here.
i
think
it's--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that's
not
a
fair
reading
of
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
and
i
would
like
to
take
the
court
through
that--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--because
it
seems
to
be
an
important
point.
i
think
this...
the
passage
that
we're
talking
about
is
on
24
through
26
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert.
petition.
the
first
passage
of
this
is
really
at
the
top
of
24,
it's
the
first
full
sentence
after
the
citation
there,
his,
mr.
jeffers's,
argument
that
the
statute...
the
statute...
is
void
on
its
face
is
foreclosed
by
our
decision
in
chaney.
you
can't
throw
out
the
statute
because
chaney
said
the
statute
was
okay.
why
did
chaney
say
that?
that's
the
next
sentence.
there,
we
rejected
a
similar
challenge
to
the
same
statute,
pointing
out
that
although
the
statutory
language
is
broad,
as
any
murder
could
be
cruel,
heinous
or
depraved,
the
arizona
supreme
court
need
not
construe
the
statute
open-endedly.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
i'm
sorry.
it's
on
page
24
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert.
petition.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
a-24.
so,
first
of
all,
it
says
we're
going
to
look
at
the
statute.
does
the
statute
pass
constitutional
muster?
no,
it
doesn't.
but
we're
not
going
to
throw
it
out
because
it's
capable
of
constitutional
construction.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
your
honor,
first
of
all,
you
changed
a
word
there,
and
i
think
it's
an
important
word.
you
said
it
held.
all
it
says
is,
"in
chaney,
we"--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--that
it
appears.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
then
it
goes
on
to
give
in
the
next
sentence...
i
think
it's
important,
your
honor,
because
in
the
next
sentence
they
do
say
the
holding
of
chaney...
the
holding
of
chaney
is
that
the
application
in
that
case
was
constitutional.
and
then
you
go
on
to
what
i
think
is
the
critical
passage,
it's
the
first
sentence,
full
sentence,
in
the
first
paragraph
that
begins
on
the
next
page.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
no.
what
i
interpret
the...
the
ninth
circuit
to
be
doing
here
is
to
be
doing
exactly
the
same
thing
with
regard
to
the...
the
definition
that
arizona
uses
that
it
was
doing
with
regard
to
the
statute.
it
said,
we
don't
know
whether
the
statute
is
constitutional.
we're
going
to
have
to
look
for
the
construction
of
it.
we
don't
know
if
the
definition
is
constitutional
because
it
will
only
become
clear
if
it's
constitutional
or
not
in
the
application--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
no,
your
honor,
and
there's
a
very
good
reason
why
i
don't
think
i
am
doing
that.
and
that
is
that
the
ninth
circuit
in
adamson,
which
was
decided
several
months
after
this
case...
at
the
end
of
the
discussion
of
heinous
and
depraved
there
said,
in
order
to
find
in
adamson
that
the
definition
in
arizona
is
unconstitutional
of
heinous
and
depraved,
do
we
have
to
overrule
any
cases
that
this
court
has
already
decided?
and
the
answer
it
gave
was
no.
at
page
1038
of
the
adamson
decision
they
said
there
is
no
prior
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
finds
the
definition
to
be
constitutional.
it
then
goes
on
to
look
at
the
chaney
case.
and
it
says
all
that
chaney
says
is...
and
it
quotes
the
portion
that
justice
white
read
to
me,
underlines
the
word
appears,
and
said
that
word
was
simply--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--it
was
an
en
banc
court.
on
this
point
it
was
without
dissent
and
one
of
the
judges
who
sat
and
signed--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--the
adamson
decision
also
signed
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
this
case,
in
the
panel
case,
judge
pregerson.
so
essentially
what
you're...
if
the
state's
reading
is
correct,
that
the
ninth
circuit
decided
that
the
definition
was
constitutional,
it
would
require
this
court
to
believe
that
judge
pregerson
decided
that
in
this
case
and
a
few
months
later
signed
on
to
another
decision
in
which
he
said
that
there
was
no
ninth
circuit
case--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--but,
your
honor,
we're
reviewing--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--excuse
me.
but
we're
reviewing
the
identical
language
that
this
court
used.
all
it
did
is
say--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--uh-huh.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
yes,
it
was.
and
if
i
could,
it
states
that
while
chaney
establishes
that
the
arizona
statute
is
not
void
on
its
face,
and
is
capable
of
constitutional
application,
it
naturally
doesn't
answer
the
question
of
whether
the
arizona
statute
was
constitutionally
applied.
the
critical
passage
there--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--to
jeffers
in
this
case.
but
the
critical
passage
is
"is
not
void
on
its
face
and
is
capable
of
constitutional
application.
"
that
refers--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
let
me--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--right.
if
i
could,
though,
your
honor,
what
it
says
is,
while
chaney
establishes...
it's
going
to
tell
us
what
chaney
established.
chaney
establishes
that
the
arizona
statute...
not
the
definition...
the
statute...
is
not
void
on
its
face.
and
the
next
clause
is,
"is
capable
of
constitutional
application".
then
it
says,
we've
got
to
determine
whether
it
was
applied
constitutionally,
and
it
goes
on
to
do
that
in
the
rest
of
the
decision.
if
i
could
just
give
you
another
explanation
here
of
why
i
think
this
has
to
be
the
proper
reading.
if
you
look
at
page
36
of
this
same
opinion
that
we're
reading,
the
court
goes
on
to
say
it
looks
at
the
varied
gretzler
standard.
that
is,
the
arizona
definition
of
heinous
and
depraved.
the
gretzler
standard
is
that
you've
got
to
have
a
case
that
convinces
the
sentencer
that
based
on
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
there's
something
about
that
case
that...
quote...
sets
the
case
apart
from
the
norm,
that
makes
it
unusually
especially
heinous
of
depraved.
that's
the
arizona
definition.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
you
may
be
right,
your
honor.
let
me
move
on
because
i
think
that
the
important
point
here
is
whether
or
not
mr.
jeffers
can
rely
upon
the
adamson
or
the
maynard
analysis
in
this
case
whatever
the
ninth
circuit
did.
i
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
did
rely
upon
this
ground.
but
it
doesn't
matter.
there
are
two
reasons
that
i
want
to
stress
to
the
court
why
this
issue
is
here
in
this
court.
the
first
issue
is
it
is
included
within
the
question
presented.
now,
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
federal
court
may
set
aside
a
state
court's
finding
of
an
aggravating
circumstance
in
a
capital
case
without
applying
a
standard
that
requires
some
deference
to
the
state
court's
finding.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
if
the
aggravating
circumstance,
as
applied
in
the
case...
as
defined
and
applied
in
the
case,
is
constitutional,
you
do
defer.
but
if
it
is
not
constitutional,
you
don't
defer.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
no.
your
honor,
i'm
not
talking
about
that
at
all.
i
think
that
the
process
by
which
you
go
about
assessing
that
question
is
laid
out
very
clearly
in
godfrey
and
maynard,
and
that's
exactly
what
i
want
to
turn
to
now,
to
go
through
the
godfrey/maynard
analysis
as
applied
to
this
case
and
show
why
it
requires
the
result...
the
judgment
that
was
granted
below.
godfrey
and
maynard
proceed
according
to
a
fourstep
process.
that
process
indicates
that
the
heinous
and
depraved
interpretation
by
the
arizona
courts
and
application
in
this
case
is
unconstitutional.
the
first
step
says
you
look
at
the
words
of
the
statute
and
you
see
if
the
words
of
the
statute
are
capable
of
narrowing.
most
aggravating
circumstances
are
going
to
win
at
that
point
and
you
would
never
get
beyond
that
point
with
95...
99
percent
of
the
aggravating
circumstances.
the
problem
is
that
as
a
result
of
the
joint
decisions
in
godfrey
and
maynard,
godfrey
knocked
out
depravity
and
maynard
knocked
out
heinousness
as
on
their
face
sufficient.
so
you've
got
to
go
to
the
next
question.
was
the
problem
with
those
words
cured
at
the
trial
court
level?
if
it
was
cured
at
the
trial
court
level,
again,
that
would
be
the
end
of
the
case.
but
there's
no
argument
here
that
it
was
cured
at
the
trial
level
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
all
the
trial
judge
did
here
was
to
recite
the
words
of
the
statute,
heinous
and
depraved.
those
words
don't
suffice
on
their
own.
secondly,
the
only
instructions
that
we
can
assume
that
the
trial
court
used
in
this
case
were
the
instructions
given
to
it
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
prior
decisions.
and
the
only
explanation
or
definition
that
existed
as
of
1980
in
arizona
as
to
what
heinous
and
depraved
meant
was
that
the
dictionary
synonyms
were
used.
that
was
the
only
definition
existing
at
the
time.
those
dictionary
synonyms
are
that
heinous
is
defined
as
grossly
bad
or
shocking
evil,
and
depraved
is
defined
as
marked
by
deterioration.
we
know
that
those
synonyms
as
a
substitute
do
not
constitutionally
suffice
because
this
court
held
that
they
don't
in
maynard
because
those
same
dictionary
synonyms
from
webster's
third
international
were
read
to
the
jury
in
the
maynard
case
at
the
trial
level.
so,
the
trial
definition
is
precisely
the
same
in
both
cases
and
it's
constitutionally
insufficient.
then
you
get
to
the
third
step
of
both
godfrey
and
maynard.
and
that
step
says
look
at
the
constitutionality
of
the
definition
that
the
state
supreme
court
has
used.
and
that's
what
i
want
to
go
immediately
because
it's
the
heart
of
the
analysis
here
and
that
is
the
gretzler
definition.
gretzler
is
cited
in
both
of
the
briefs,
all
of
the
briefs,
saying
that's
the
standard.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
and
gretzler
begins...
it's
a
five-step
process.
it
begins
by
reciting
once
again
the
dictionary
definitions.
the
next
thing
it
does
is
to
say
there's
some
factors
that
we've
looked
at
in
the
past
in
looking
at
whether
those
definitions
are
met,
and
it
lists
some
factors.
they
include
such
things
as
whether
the
violence
in
the
case
was
gratuitous,
whether
there
was
relish,
and
whether
the
killing
was
senseless.
then,
the
third
step
of
the
process
is
the
critical
one.
the
court
states
its
standard
at
page
12
of
gretzler.
and
there
it
says
that
the
court
will
reverse
a
finding
that
the
crime
was
committed
in
an
especially
heinous
or
depraved
manner
only...
quote...
where
the
circumstance...
or,
where
no
circumstances,
such
as
the
specific
factors
discussed
above,
separate
the
crime
from
the
norm
of
first-degree
murder.
and
the
court
has
made
clear,
not
only
because
it
said
it
three
times
in
gretzler,
but
in
numerous
cases
afterwards,
that
those
five
factors
that
it
set
out
do
not
need
to
be
present.
you
can
find
heinous
and
depraved
if
some
factor
beyond
those
five
is
present.
and,
indeed,
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
a
number
of
cases
has
found
heinous
and
depraved
present
without
finding
any
of
the
gretzler
factors
that
were
specifically
mentioned
because
it's
factors
such
as
those
that
are
critical.
it's
also
critical
that
those
factors
don't
control
the
outcome.
what
controls
the
outcome
is
whether
looking
at
those
factors
and
those
definitions
the
court
decides
that
there's
something
about
the
case
that
sets
the
crime
apart
from
the
norm
of
first-degree
murder.
and
that
norm
has
never
been
defined.
so,
therefore,
there
are
a
number
of
cases
as
well
in
which
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
found
the
gretzler
factors
present
but
nonetheless
said
that's
not
a
heinous
and
depraved
case
because
those
factors
or
no
other
factors
set
it
apart
from
the
norm.
by
the
way,
the
court
has
used
a
number
of
alternative
phrases.
but
they're
all
to
the
same
effect.
elsewhere
it
has
said
that
the
case
is
heinous
and
depraved
under
the
circumstance
if
it
is
more
heinous
or
depraved
than
the
usual
first-degree
murder.
sometimes
the
phrase
is
that
the
case
is...
quote...
particularly
disturbing.
or,
oftentimes
it
simply
says
the
case
has
to
be
especially
heinous
or
especially
depraved
and
it
underlines
especially.
the
next
step
in
the
gretzler
procedure
is
to
say,
well,
how
are
sentencers
supposed
to
know
whether
the
violence
in
a
case
is
sufficiently
gratuitous,
for
example,
to
suffice,
or
how
are
sentencers
to
go
about
identifying
factors
such
as
but
in
addition
to
the
factors
that
gretzler
listed.
and
it
says
very
clearly
the
courts
are
to
look
and
see
whether
there
are
any
additional
circumstances
so
as
to
set
the
crime
apart
from
the
usual
or
the
norm.
it
is
clear
in
arizona,
as
a
result
of
gretzler
and
as
a
result
of
all
other
cases,
that
the
standard
is
you
look
at
all
of
the
factors,
such
as
those
listed
in
gretzler,
but
not
by
any
means
limited
to
them...
and
the
court
has
added
since
then
about
20
additional
factors...
and
you
ask
whether
any
of
those
factors,
or
something
else
in
the
case,
adds
up
to
something
additional
that
makes
this
case
especially
bad.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
right.
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
mr.
jeffers
case.
in
other
words,
the
next
step
in
the
godfrey/maynard
analysis
is
to
see
whether
that
same
kind
of
definition
was
applied
in
the
particular
case.
and,
again,
there's
no
dispute.
gretzler
was
applied
in
this
case.
gretzler
was
decided
about
three
weeks
before
mr.
jeffers'
case.
gretzler
is
cited
numerous
times
in
jeffers'
case
and
his
case
follows
the
same
protocol.
first,
it
says
look
at
the
dictionary
synonyms.
then
it
says
you
look
at
the
various
factors
in
the
case,
and
it
quotes
about
nine
or
ten
such
factors.
and
it
says
that
it
finds
that
this
case
does
satisfy
the
factor
because
there
are...
quote...
additional
circumstances
that
distinguished
the
murder
from
the
usual
or
the
norm
of
first-degree
murders.
it
applies
the
gretzler
standard.
most
importantly
i
think,
for
your
purposes
here...
for
our
purposes,
it
goes
at
the
very
end
of
the
discussion
of
heinous
and
depraved
and
it
confronts
mr.
jeffers'
argument
under
godfrey
that
the
arizona
definition
was
unconstitutional
for
lack
of
a
narrowing
construction.
and
the
court
says
we
do
have
a
narrowing
construction.
that
construction
is...
and
this
is
how
we
satisfy
the
requirements
of
godfrey...
that
construction
is...
and
i
quote...
it
says
that
the
case
has
to
be...
has
to
stand
apart
from
the
norm
and
the
killing
has
to
be
especially
heinous
and
especially
depraved.
again,
the
especially
underlined.
so,
again,
it's
clear
that
that
same
standard
extracted
from
gretzler
was
applied
in
mr.
jeffers'
case.
that
standard
from
gretzler
applied
in
mr.
jeffers'
case
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
identical
to
the
standard
that
oklahoma
used
in
the
maynard
case,
and
it
has
the
exact
same
two
defects
that
this
court
identified
in
the
maynard
case
in
unanimously
overturning
the
oklahoma
construction.
the
first
problem
is
that
the
standard
used
in
arizona
is
a
totality
of
the
circumstances
approach.
there
is
no
objective
factor
that
must
be
present
for
the
murder
to
satisfy
the--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--well,
you're
suggesting--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
i
think
you're
suggesting
sort
of
the
reverse
of
godfrey.
godfrey
said
we've
got
an
okay
standard--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--okay.
and
let
me
try
and
answer
it.
that...
in...
in...
if
you
had
a
case
in
which
that
kind
of
thing
happened
that
you
have
hypothesized,
i
think
it
might
be
possible
to
save
an
application
from
an
otherwise
unconstitutional
definition.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
the
answer
is
yes.
but
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
and
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
for
that.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
that's
right.
mr.
james
s.
liebman
well,
your
honor,
i...
if
i
take
your
hypothetical--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--i'm
saying
that
you...
you
could
save...
you
could
save
it
in...
in
that
way
in
an
individual
case.
but--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--that's
the
process
that
oklahoma
is
now
going
through
in
looking
at
case
after
case
in
the
wake
of
maynard
and
saving
some
cases
and
not
savings
others
because
it's
finding
that
there
were
factors
in
those
cases.
but
that's
not
this
case,
your
honor,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
we
obviously
have
to
take
the
arizona
supreme
court
at
its
word
here,
and
its
word
is
that
it
followed
the
gretzler
standard
and
it
didn't
rely
on
any
one
or
two
factors
that
are
set.
it
looked
to
see
whether
in
its
subjective
judgment
the
facts
of
the
case
as
a
whole
set
it
apart
from
the
norm.
the
second
thing
is
the
only
two
factors
that
one
could
point
to
are
these
words
"relish"
and
"gratuitous
violence".
those
words
don't
have
any
more
content
than
the
words
"heinous"
and
"depraved",
and,
therefore,
even
if
you
could
have
a
case
where
there
were
just
two
factors
and
those
factors
would
be
enough,
it
couldn't
be
where
those
factors
are
equally
as
unconstitutional
as
heinous
and
depraved.
the
second
and
final
point
that
i
want
to
make
here
is
really
the
point
that
justice
white
suggested
in
his
question,
and
that
is
that
if
you
have
a
standard
that
uses
a
definitional
strategy
that
says
we're
going
to
define,
looking
at
this
totality
of
the
circumstances,
a
qualifying
case...
a
heinous
and
depraved
case...
as
one
in
which
we
look
at
it
all
and
we
say
it's
especially
bad,
this
court
said
quite
clearly
in
maynard
that
that
kind
of
an
approach
is
unconstitutional.
the
court
actually
said...
it
explicitly
ruled
in
maynard
that
the
requirement
that
the
crime
be...
quote...
more
than
just
heinous,
does
not
satisfy
the
eighth
amendment
because
it
does
not
in
the
words
of
maynard
inform
sentencers
of
what
they
must
find
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
if
i
might,
it
seems
to
me
what
the
standard
in
maynard
is...
is
that
you
can't
just
have
an
adjective
and
an
adverb.
you've
got
to
have
a
noun
or
a
verb
to
go
with
it.
especially
what?
abnormally
what?
unusually
what?
and
that
what--
mr.
james
s.
liebman
--if
you
had
another
phrase...
instead
of
heinous
if
you
had
some
core
definition
that
has,
as
justice
white
i
think
put
it
in
jurek,
that
has
a
common
sense
core
of
meaning...
for
example,
torture,
or,
for
example,
an
intent
to
inflict
great
harm.
those
are
concepts.
or
kidnapping
or
killing
a
police
officer,
all
of
the
other
aggravating
circumstance
have
that
common
core
of
meaning.
but
the
words
heinous
and
depraved
don't
have
that
common
core
and
no
matter
how
many
"especialies"
or
"particularlies"
you
put
in
front
of
them,
you
don't
give
the
content
that
this
court
required
in
furman
to
make
it
constitutional.
that
was
the
problem
that
this
court
found
in
maynard,
that
indeed
in
oklahoma
they
had
said,
we
are
going
to
look
at
the
manner
of
the
killing
and
we're
going
to
look
at
the
attitude
of
the
killer
and
we're
going
to
see
if
those
factors,
when
we
look
at
them,
make
this
case
especially
bad.
and
this
court
said
you
can't
do
that,
you
need
to
say
what
it
is,
what
that
factor
is,
or
what
those
factors
are
that
make
it
bad
and
that
have
that
common
sense
core
of
meaning.
and
that
common
sense
core
doesn't
exist
here.
just
to
answer
one
of
the
questions
that
the...
was
raised
in
the
first
argument
here.
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
conduct
proportionality
review
in
this
case,
and
i
don't
think
that
proportionality
review
would
be
appropriate
in
a
constitutional
review
of
an
aggravating
circumstance.
it
was
very
clear
about
why
it
looked
at
those
cases,
and
it
looked
at
cases...
and
it's
more
than
six...
it
quoted
about
12
cases
because
it
also
looked
at
the
ones
that
are
discussed
in
gretzler.
and
it
said,
we
can't
find
the
definition
that
arizona
has
given
to
be
constitutional
on
its
face,
but
let's
see
if
we
can
look
at
cases
and
extract
from
those
cases
a
better
definition,
a
definition
that
would
save
the
statute.
and
that's
why
it
looked
at
those
cases.
however,
when
it
looked
at
those
cases,
it
said,
you
cannot
extract
a
definition
from
those
cases
that
both
saves
the
constitutionality
of
the
standard
by
providing
a
principal
means
to
separate
death
from
life
cases
and
that
applies
to
this
case.
there's
simply
no
definition
that
you
could
extract.
so,
it's
not
proportionality
review
at
all.
it
is
simply
a
look
to
the
cases
to
see
if
you
can
save
an
otherwise
unconstitutional
statute
and
definition
by
looking
to
the
cases
and
finding
in
the
application,
as
reflected
in
those
cases,
a
definition
that
would
be
constitutional
and
would
save
the
application.
but
because
the
court
found
that
the
line
had
not,
as
it
put,
been
made
clear...
that
line
between
a
special
and
usual
depravity,
as
it
said...
since
that
line
hadn't
been
made
clear
in
mr.
jeffers'
case
and
you
couldn't
find
a
line
that
applied
from
the
other
cases,
you
had
to
find
that
as
applied
in
this
case
it
was
unconstitutional.
it
seems
to
me
then,
in
conclusion,
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
both
godfrey
and
maynard's
use
of
godfrey
in
that
case.
arizona's
construction
of
the
especially
heinous
and
depraved
circumstance
stands
on
exactly
the
same
footing
as
oklahoma's.
it
is
open-ended
and
there
is
no
common
sense
core
of
meaning
to
it.
for
those
reasons,
mr.
jeffers...
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
should
be
affirmed,
that
mr.
jeffers'
death
sentence
is
unconstitutional,
both
as
the
definition
of
that
circumstance
has
been
given
in
the
definition,
and
as
it
was
applied
in
this
case.
