justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
ask
this.
we
are
talking
about,
you...
everyone
concedes,
i
take
it,
that
an
expenditure
in
election,
direct
expenditure
is
speech.
it
is
speech
we
are
talking
about,
an
expenditure--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
i
take
it
that
the
state
must
establish
a
compelling
interest
to
restrict
that
speech?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
the
means
be
narrowly
tailored.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
then
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
justice
scalia's
question
indicates
that
you
have
to
give
a
specific
reason
why
a
corporation
of
that
type
presents
more
a
danger
than
donald
trump,
and
i
didn't
really
hear
the
answer
to
that
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
has
to
be
answered
in
the
terms
of
a
compelling
interest
that
is
narrowly
tailored.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
not
an
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
not
an
interest,
that
is
just
a
rationale,
that's
just
a
rationale
for
the
legislative
exercise
of
power.
that
is
not
an
interest.
an
interest
is
an
evil
that
has
to
be
corrected.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
have
just
been
put...
you've
just
been
put
a
hypothetical
where
that
is
not
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
but...
that
does
not
sound
to
me...
that
does
not
sound
to
me
like
a
compelling
interest,
and
it
does
not
sound
to
me
like
scrutiny.
that
is
just
legislative
deference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
i
understand...
as
i
understand
this
statute,
if
a
candidate
smith
has
been
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan,
the
aclu
cannot
take
out
an
advertisement
explaining
that
fact
and
asking
people
to
vote
for
jones.
or
am
i
incorrect?
can
the
aclu
do
that,
the
aclu
being
a
nonprofit
corporation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
a
nonprofit
corporation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
find
it
very
hard
to
see
that,
the
fact
that
they
can
make
this
expenditure
through
a
fund
in
any
way
really
mitigates
the
evil,
but
it
certainly
does
diminish
the
message.
i
am
not
interested
in
what
a
pac
says,
i
am
interested
in
what
the
aclu
says.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
you
would
think
that
the
legislature
could
prohibit
the
nonprofit
corporation
from
publishing
a
journal
then,
the
ama
monthly
journal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
corporations
can
be
regulated,
if
there
is
too
much
speech,
if
that
is
an
evil,
why
can't
the
state
prohibit
the
american
medical
association
from
publishing
its
monthly
journal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
saying...
you're
saying
that
corporations
have
too
much
power,
that
there
is
too
much
speech,
that
this
is
an
evil,
the
corporations
gather
great
deals
of
money,
that
they
are
created
by
the
state.
therefore,
we
give
legislative
deference.
all
of
those
arguments
can
be
made
to
support
the
proposition
that
the
ama
journal,
that
the
aclu
newsletter,
ought
to
be
regulated
by
the
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
are
talking
about
a
matter
of
principle.
and
we
are
asking
you
to
tell
us
what
the
evil
is
in
the
speech
that
nonprofit
corporations
present
in
election
campaigns.
and
all
of
the
comments
you
have
made
so
far
would
equally
support
the
proposition
that
you
can
prohibit
the
publication
of
their
monthly
newspaper,
or
prohibit
them
from
giving
to
churches,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
or
that
you
can
require
them
to
give
to
one
party
and
not
to
the
other.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
aclu?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
people
give
money
to
the
aclu
for
economic
benefit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
you
read
the
amicus
briefs
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
aclu
has
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
this
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
you
read
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
don't
they
indicate
in
that
case
that
they
take
corporate
contributions,
and
therefore
they
do
not
qualify
under
the
third
prong
of
the
test
that
we
set
forth
in
the
massachusetts
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
have
any
reason
to
doubt
that
what
they've
said
is
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
then
the
aclu
doesn't
qualify
under
that
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
it
communicate
the
ratings?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
one
candidate
was
rated
on
a
scale
of
one
to...
or
zero
to
ten,
and
he
was
rated
at
ten
and
the...
his
opponent
was
regulated
at
one,
then
that
would
obviously
be
interpreted
as
support
if
you
communicated
the
rating?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
summary
in
the
record
or
in
the
trial
courts
finding
as
to
the
number
of
unincorporated
union
associations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
are
incorporated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
you
can
point
to
to
establish
that,
or
do
we
just
take
judicial
notice
of
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
means
that
your
speech
is
restricted.
