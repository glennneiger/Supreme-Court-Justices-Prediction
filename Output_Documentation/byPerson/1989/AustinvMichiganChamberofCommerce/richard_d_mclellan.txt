mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
michigan
state
chamber
of
commerce
is
a
nonprofit
michigan
membership
corporation.
it
was
organized
in
1959
for
the
specific
purpose
of
promoting
economic
development
and
the
preservation
and
enhancement
of
the
american
enterprise
system.
both
the
purpose
and
the
activities
of
the
state
chamber
of
commerce
are
ideological.
the
state
chamber
lobbies
in
the
state
capital
on
legislation,
it
is
actively
involved
in
ballot
question
campaigns
and
referenda
in
the
state,
it
educates
its
members
and
the
public
with
respect
to
public
policy
issues.
it
maintains
a
separate
segregated
fund
for
the
purpose
of
making
political
contributions
to
candidates,
and
it
rates
candidates
on
a
job
provider
index.
but
the
state
chamber
of
commerce
does
not
communicate
its
views
to
the
general
public
with
respect
to
candidates
because
section
54
of
the
michigan
campaign
finance
act
makes
it
a
felony
for
such
commun...
for
the
chamber
to
engage
in
such
communications.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
it
cannot.
not
if
those
are
in
any
way
in
support
of
or
opposition
to
the
election
of
a
candidate.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
if
the
purpose
was...
and
i
am
assuming
that
the
purpose
would
be
to
influence
the
general
public.
they
do
not
publish
ratings
as
a
general
educational
matter.
their
purpose
in
speaking
is
ideological
and
it
is
designed
to
influence
the
election
or
defeat
of
candidates.
importantly
though,
the
michigan
campaign
finance
act
is
different
from
the
federal
election
campaign
act.
the
michigan
act,
which
was
adopted
in
1976,
prohibits
only
corporate
speech.
unincorporated
labor
organization
speech
is
unregulated.
in
fact--
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
--yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
the...
yes.
we
have
briefed,
and
we
brought
the
case
originally
on
both
first
amendment
and
equal
protection,
it
was
briefed
and
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
have
briefed
it
here.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
they
did
not.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
because
the
court
of
appeals
found
for
us
on
the
first
amendment--
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
--they
did
not
need
to
go
to
the
equal
protection.
we
point
this
out,
the
disparate
treatment
between
corporations
and
unincorporated
unions,
for
two
reasons.
the
primary
reason
that,
in
michigan
the
political
marketplace
is
largely
characterized
by
the
contest
between
the
forces
of
organized
labor
and
business.
and
the
michigan
law,
because
it
treats
the
michigan
chamber
of
commerce
differently
than
its
primary
adversaries,
which
were
identified
in
the
trial
as
the
united
auto
workers
and
the
afl-cio,
this
disparate
treatment
creates
an...
a
disadvantage
to
the
michigan
state
chamber
of
commerce
in
carrying
out
its
purposes,
which
is
to
be
a
political
and
ideological
organization
within
the
state
of
michigan.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
it
may
be
important
in
your
analysis,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
this
case,
because
mr.
caruso
and
the
state
have
argued
that
the
amassing
of
wealth
is
the
important
state
interest.
and
unions,
particularly
the
major
labor
organizations
in
the
state
of
michigan,
are
able,
because
of
their
size
and
their
broad
membership
base
and
the
special
advantages
that
they
have
under
the
law,
to
amass
substantial
wealth.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
in
michigan,
unlike
the
federal
law,
they
use
their
general
union
treasury
funds
for--
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
--political
purposes.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
both
direct
contributions
and
independent
expenditures.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
they
do
for
federal
law
purposes.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
yes.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
there
is
not
any
finding
there,
your
honor.
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
that
i
recall
was
that
there
are
22
michigan
unions
that
are
incorporated,
including
the
michigan
education
association,
which--
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
--are
incorporated.
most
other
large
unions
are
unincorporated.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
i
think
you
take
judicial
notice
of
that.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
there
is
not
in
the
michigan
campaign
finance
act,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
they,
members
do
have
the
rights--
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
--this
court
has
recognized
that,
in,
that
there
are
other
laws
that
protect
union
members.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
no,
they
are
not.
there
are
federal
restrictions
on
them.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
yes.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
it
would.
a
member
of
a
union
would
be
able
to
assert
his
or
her
constitutional
interests.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
yes.
my
understanding
is
that
unions
that
are
contesting
it
have
that
opportunity.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
under
the
present
system
we
are
able
to
lobby
on
legislative
issues,
participate
in
ballot
question
campaigns.
we
are
not
able
to
articulate
the
connection
between
a
particular
issue
and
a
particular
candidate.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
yes.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
correct.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
correct.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
the
primary
operational
reason
is
that
pacs
have
a
significant,
negative
image
in
the
public.
and
the
state
chamber
of
commerce,
as
was
submitted
in
court,
has
a
very
strong
reputation,
the
state
chamber
of
commerce.
and
to
be
able
to
speak
with
your
own
voice,
with
your
own
name
on
the
bottom
of
the
advertisement,
that
this
is
the
view
of
the
state
chamber
of
commerce--
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
--the
michigan
state
chamber
of
commerce,
every
member,
corporate
or
individual,
must
subscribe
to
the
objectives
of
the
state
chamber.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
no,
and
they
may
not.
in
fact
they,
it
is
a
diverse
membership.
there
is
a,
it
is
a
widely
diverse
membership,
in
size
and
function
of
business--
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
--that
is
right.
we
don't
want
to
have
to--
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
--we
don't
want
to
go
through
the
same--
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
--that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
our
speech
is
restricted.
if
we
have
to
use
that
mechanism,
there
are
substantial
burdens
that
we
would
be
faced--
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
--yes,
the
same
argument
can
be
made,
and
we
would
make
it.
we
would
make
it
particularly
in
this
sense.
in
this
case,
in
michigan
under
the
michigan
law,
there
has
been
no
showing
of
any
state
interest
that
would
restrict
independent
expenditures
generally.
there
was
no
legislative
findings
dealing
with
independent
expenditures.
there
was
no
evidence
submitted
at
the
trial
that
would
suggest
that
there
is
something
inherently
corrupting
or
potentially
corrupting
by
corporate
independent
expenditures
generally.
so,
in
answer
to
your
question,
yes.
we
do
not
think
that
that
is
a
significant
distinction.
however,
this
has
been
addressed
by
the
court
and
we
are,
and
i
am
responding
to
that
analysis.
this
is
the
first
time
this
court
has
considered
the
constitutionality
of
a
state
law
that
bans
independent
expenditures
in
the...
with
regard
to
a
candidate,
by
an
ideological
corporation
that
has
business
corporation
members.
and
we
suggest
that
the
analysis
that
this
court
has
made
with
respect
to
independent
expenditures
generally
is
equally
applicable
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
we
are
incorporated
in
the
michigan
nonprofit
corporation
act,
that
permits
a
corporation
be
organized
for
any
lawful
purpose.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that...
that
we
would
argue
that
the
first
amendment
would
permit
that
person...
again,
you
would
still
have
to
do
the
analysis
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
sufficient
reason
for
the
state
to
restrict
them.
even
in
the
case
where
they
create--
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
--yes,
i
think
so.
i
think
that
clearly
the
state
laws
provide
a
structure
for
the
operation
of
that
corporation
and
might
well
require
that.
this
is
a
prohibition
on
the
speech,
and
i
think
that
there
may
well
be
other
steps
that
would
be
appropriate
by
the
state.
let
me
just,
a
final
point
here.
i
repeat
again
that
from
our
view,
in
this
case
the
state
utterly
failed
to
prove
a
state
interest
that
would
permit
the
imposition
of
the
substantial
ban
on
corporate
speakers;
that
independent
expenditures
in
michigan
on
the
record
in
this
case
are
not
corrupt;
that,
in
addition,
this
speech
is
valuable
by
the
michigan
state
chamber
of
commerce,
its
political
adversaries,
by
other
ideological
groups,
corporate
and
unincorporated;
that
there
is
a
value
here
that
should
be
recognized
by
this
court
and
by
the
michigan
legislature
and
that
is
to
inform
the
public,
to
have
a
diversity
of
views
and
to
reflect
a
true
competition
of
ideas
and
the
free
market
basically
in
ideas.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
properly
interpreted
the
decisions
of
this
court.
we
think
that
its
decision
was
consistent
with
prior
decisions.
it
was
fair,
and
will
assure
ideological
groups
the
opportunity
to--
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
--i
believe
an
ideological
group...
it
does...
it
is
an
ideological
group.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
no,
i
do
not
think
it,
general
motors
is
an
ideological
group.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
no,
simply
because
they
are
organized
for
a
different
purpose.
i
think
that
you
can
identify
those
groups
that
have
organized
themselves
to
primarily
advocate
ideas,
not
all
necessarily
political
ideas,
but
they
are
ideological
in
that
sense.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
yes.
some
health
care
groups,
other
groups
may
not
be
ideological.
certainly,
i
think
that
they
would
be
supporting
it,
their
purpose
would
not
be
ideological.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
in
general,
trade
associations,
i
think,
are
organized
for
largely
public
policy
and
ideological
purposes.
mr.
richard
d.
mclellan
would
be.
civic
action
organizations,
like
the
aclu,
naacp,
are
the
more
common
examples
of
ideological
groups.
but
the
state
chamber
of
commerce,
trade
associations,
environmental
groups,
are
equally
ideological
in
that
sense.
the
fact,
from
our
perspective,
that
they,
that
the
chamber
represents
business
interests
does
not
make
it
any
less
ideological.
the
issues
in
which
they
are
involved
are
ideological.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
argument.
thank
you.
