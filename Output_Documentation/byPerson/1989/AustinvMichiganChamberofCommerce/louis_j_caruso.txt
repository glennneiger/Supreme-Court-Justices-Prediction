mr.
louis
j.
caruso
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
provision
in
the
michigan
campaign
finance
act
that
prohibits
independent
expenditures
from
being
made
in
candidate
elections
from
the
general
treasuries
of
corporations
is
constitutionally
permissible.
the
michigan
chamber
of
commerce,
a
nonprofit
membership
corporation,
contends
that
it
violates
the
first
and
fourteenth
amendments.
the
district
court,
the
trial
court,
sustained
the
validity
of
the
act
and
disagreed
with
the
chamber.
the
court
of
appeals,
sixth
circuit,
reversed,
holding
that
as
applied
to
the
chamber,
the
provision
violates
the
chamber's
first
amendment
free
speech
rights.
this
court
has
said
in
earlier
cases
that
the
government's
interest
in
regulating
the
activity
of...
political
activity
of
corporations
are
sufficiently
important
to
justify
such
regulations
when
the
means
are
closely
drawn.
the
prevention
of
corruption
and
the
appearance
of
corruption
in
the
electoral
process
by
a
legislative
scheme
aimed
in
part
at
corporations
reflects
a
legislative
judgment
that
the
special
characteristics
of
a
corporation
require
particularly
careful
regulation
and
should
be
given
considerable
deference
by
the
court.
it
is
michigan's
position
that
the
potential
danger
from
corporate
independent
expenditures
in
connection
with
candidate
elections
poses
a
sufficient
compelling
interest
that
permits
michigan
to
regulate
those
corporations
that
do
not
fall
within
the
exception
set
out
by
this
court
in
federal
election
commission
v.
massachusetts
citizens
for
life,
that
the
chamber
is
unlike
that
corporation
the
court
dealt
with
in
mcfl
and
may
be
regulated.
now,
i
am
not
unmindful
that
in
buckley
and
in
national
conservative
political
action
cases,
that
the
court
struck
down
independent
limitations
on
independent
expenditures.
however,
in
buckley,
the
court
dealt
with
individuals
and
groups,
and
not
with
corporations.
and
in
the
ncpac
case,
the
spending
limits
applied
to
any
group,
association,
as
well
as
corporations,
all
impermissibly,
as
the
court
said,
lumped
together.
the
court
found
the
regulation
in
ncpac
over
inclusive,
and
not
narrowly
drawn.
and
the
group
at
which
the
regulation
was
aimed
was
not
regulated...
historically
was
not
regulated
to
justify
deference
by
the
court
to
legislative
judgment
in
that
case,
as
the
court
had
done
in
national
right
to
work
case
when
it
permitted
inclusion
of
nonprofit
corporations
in
the
legislative
regulatory
scheme
to
stand.
here
the
prohibition
applies
only
to
corporations.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
labor
unions--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--justice
o'connor,
labor
unions
are
not
excluded
as
such.
they
are
not
included
when
you
read
the
particular
language.
if
a
labor
union
is
incorporated,
it
is
included.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
there
are
22
major
labor
unions
in
the
state
of
michigan
incorporated,
including
the
mea,
and
they
are
included.
and
with
respect
to
not
including
them
expressly,
whether
they
are
incorporated
or
not
incorporated,
this
court
has
said
many
times
we
defer
to
legislative
judgment
as
to
those
entities
that
require
regulation.
there
may
be
some
entities
that
pose
the
same
problem
and
the
same
potential
threat
to
the
electoral
process
as
do
corporations,
but
we
defer
to
the
legislative
judgment
in
this
area,
and
that,
and
perhaps
at
some
particular
time
the
legislature
may
see
fit
to
include
labor
unions,
labor
unions
if
they
are
not
incorporated,
but
they
have
not
done
so
at
this
time.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
well,
the
court
has
viewed
that
political
corporations,
that
corporations
are
given
by
state
authorities
certain
benefits
by
virtue
of
the
corporate
form.
they
are
given
certain
benefits
in
respect
of
liability,
certain
benefits
in
respect
of
taxes,
certain
benefits
in
respect
of
perpetual
life.
and
what
this
court
has
seen
in
the
past,
that
that...
the
legislature
has
seen
this
and
has
provided
against
their
taking
advantage
of
that...
those
particular
advantages
given
to
corporations
and
turning
them
into
an
advantage
in
the
electoral
process
and
in
the
political
arena.
now,
the
court
has
said
that
the
legislature's
judgment
in
this
area
is
one
that
we
will
defer
to.
now,
with
respect
to
an
individual,
for
example,
doctors--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--yes,
that
is
correct,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
and
the
means
are
to
be
narrowly
tailored,
that
is
correct.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
well,
the
thing
of
it
is--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--the
compelling
interest
is
the
fact
that
they
have
been
given
certain
advantages
by
the
state
legislature
for
other
purposes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
well,
it's
the
fact,
the
fact--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--the
evil
is
the
fact
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
are
incorporated,
corporations,
they
gain
an
advantage,
and
they
are
able
to
amass
great
wealth
in
the
economic
sphere--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--not
in
the
family
corporation
case,
that
is
true.
but
in
the
traditional
corporations
it
is
true.
now,
the
fact
that
a
family
corporation,
as
compared
to
a
large
corporation,
do
not
have
equal
funds.
nevertheless,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
according
to
the
decision
in
mcfl.
this
court
said
the
big
corporations
as
well
as
those
less
fortunate
are
nevertheless...
may
come
within
the
prohibition
because
we
refer...
defer
to
the
legislative
judgment.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--that
is,
the
fact
is
that
the
evil
is
a
potential
corruption
of
injecting
monies
that
have
been
generated
through
the
corporate
process
in
the
economic
sphere
to
effect
an
equal...
to
unequal
a
playing
field
in
the
political
arena.
and
this
is
what
the...
what
is
aimed
at.
now,
historically,
corporations
have
been
regulated.
for
example,
in
michigan
historically
they
have
been
regulated
since
1913,
and
they
have
been
regulated
to
begin
with
with
the,
first
was
the
corrupt
practices
act
since
1913.
and
it
was
not
until
1976
that
the
campaign
finance
act
as
we
know
it
today,
came
along.
and
for
the
first
time
the
legislature
included
within
the
prohibition
independent
expenditures.
here...
heretofore,
the
impediment
of
the
prohibition
related
only
to
contributions.
but
in
1976
they
added
independent
expenditures.
and
at
the
same
time
they
did
that
they
permitted
corporations
to
establish
separate
segregated
funds
by
using
corporate
monies.
they
also--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--the
aclu?
i
don't
know
whether
they
are--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--nonprofit
corporation.
if
they
do
not
come
within
the
exception
that
has
been
cast
by
this
court
in
mcfl
i
would
say
that
that
prohibition,
yes,
unless
they
did
it
through
a
segregated
fund.
now,
the
fact
is
that
there
are--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--the
thing
of
it
is,
the
segregated
fund,
they
can
do
this,
simply
because
the
money
contributed
to
a
segregated
fund
is
money
given
for
political
purposes.
it
is
given,
in
michigan
it
is
restricted
to...
in
a
membership
corporation,
to
the
members,
to
the
officers...
and
to
the
officials
who
occupy
a
managerial
position.
with
respect
to
profit
corporations,
it
is
similarly
limited
to
stockholders,
employees
who
have
managerial
positions
and
the
officers
of
that
corporation.
and
the
fund
is
given
voluntarily,
it
is
given
for
specific
purposes,
for
political
activity.
now,
if
we
are
permitting
these
corporations
to
use
funds
that
have
been
generated
for
another
purpose
into
the
political
arena,
we
are
causing
what
the,
this
court
has,
what
the
legislature
believes
to
be
a
potential
threat
to
the
economic
market,
or
to
the
political
marketplace,
and
causing
an
unfair
advantage
to
corporations
over
private
parties.
i
would
respect--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--there
is
a
media
exception,
but
that
media
exception,
justice
o'connor,
has
to
do
specifically
with
news
stories,
commentaries,
editorials,
and
the
regular
course
of
publication
and
broadcasting.
so,
if
they
are
incorporated
and
it
is
a
news
media,
they
may
sell
those
magazines.
but
what--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--that
is
correct.
they
may
be
able
to
do
that.
but
what
they
cannot
do,
they
are
not
excluded
from
the
act,
but
if
they
are
incorporated
and
a
newspaper
wants
to
pay
for
an
ad
in
another
newspaper,
or
pay
for
an
ad
through
some
broadcasting
station,
i
think
they
would
be
precluded
by
this
statute
because
the
exception
only
applies
to
news
stories,
commentaries,
editorials
and
the
regular
course
of
business.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
pardon?
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
well,
the
fact
is
that--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--well,
i
couldn't
put
it
that
quite
way.
we
mistrust
too
much
speech,
but
the
thing
of
it
is
they
get--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--they
get
speech,
they
are
able
to
get
a
great
deal
of
speech,
and
perhaps
very
effective
speech,
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
state
has
given
them
an
advantage
to
develop...
to
acquire
these
monies,
limited
liability
and
so
forth,
and
then...
and
put...
and
direct
this
thing
toward
the,
in
the
electoral
process,
which...
which
the
legislature
has
seen
for
many
years
to
prohibit
and
which
this
court
says
that
they
will
defer
to
that
judgment,
even
though
they
recognize...
and
they
said
this...
and
you
said
this
in
mcfl,
even
though
you
recognize
there
are
other
entities
that
perhaps
pose
as
much
a
danger
or
a
greater
danger
than
corporations
do.
but
nevertheless,
if
the
fact
is
that
the--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--that
is
right.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
well,
the
thing
of
it
is,
here
again,
insofar
as
making
contributions
is
concerned
and
independent
expenditures
is
concerned,
in
today's
society
i
don't
see
the
effect
being
any
different.
in
other
words,
this
court
has
prohibited
in
the
past
contributions
by
corporations,
but
they
have
not
reached
and
answered
the
question
on
independent
expenditures.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
pardon?
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
independent
expenditures,
i
believe,
today,
with
the
political
consultants,
they
abound
in
the
states,
and
with
the
sophisticated
news
media
we
have
today,
electronic
systems
that
we
have,
i
think
that
money,
independent
expenditures
can
be
very
skillfully
manipulated
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
be
just
as
much
a
benefit
to
that
candidate
and...
as
contributions.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
pardon?
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
the
evil
is
that
they
get
talked
at
too
much
by...
because
money
has
been
made
available.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
it's
more
than
just
a
bribe.
heretofore
it
was
considered...
contributions
were
outlawed
on
the
basis
that
there
is
a
quid
pro...
a
quid
pro
quo,
in
other
words,
an
exchange,
which
doesn't
exist
in
independent
expenditures
perhaps.
i
think
that
it
does.
nevertheless,
the
fact
is
that
the
corporations
have
an
unfair
advantage
in
the
marketplace
because
they
are
in
a
position
of
generating
monies,
they
are
in
a
position
of
not
being
subjected
to
the
liability
that
individuals
are
and
these
other
entities
are,
and
the
legislature
has
historically
regulated
corporations
for
so
many
years.
and
the
whole,
sole
reason
they
regulating
these
corporations
for
so
many
years
is
simply
because
they
do
occupy
that
special
position
and
the
advantages
given
to
these
corporations
by
the
legislature.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
why,
i
suppose
it
can.
i
don't
think
that
the
michigan
campaign
finance
act
prohibits
that.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
michigan
campaign
finance
act
permits
corporations
to
make
direct
expenditures
and
contributions
without
limit
to
ballot
questions.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
to
one
party
and
not
to
another?
i
wouldn't
think
so.
i
don't
think
they
should
be
permitted
to
contribute
to
any
party.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
to
do...
to
say
what?
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
don't
believe
they
can
prohibit
that.
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
the
issue
here,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--but
not
in...
in
candidate
elections
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
not
anything
other
than
candidate
elections.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
don't
know
of
anything
like
that
being
in
the
campaign
finance
act.
here
again
i
say
that
the
evil
is
that
they
are...
they
have
members,
people
involved
in
corporations,
they
give
money
to
corporations,
they
invest
money
in
corporations,
not
for
the
purposes
of
becoming
involved
in
the
political
process.
they
become...
the
purposes
they
give
money
to
the
corporations
for
the
most
part
is
for
economic
benefit.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
the
aclu,
that
is--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--and
here
again,
as
i
say,
the
aclu
may
well
come
within
the
exception
of
the
mcfl
decision.
in
other
words,
if
it
is
a
politically,
if
it
is
a
political
action
group
and
it
is
an
ideological
group--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--pardon?
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes,
they
have.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
if
that
is
the
case,
if
that
is
correct,
then
i
suggest--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--no,
i
have
no,
no--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--then
i
would
say
that...
i
would
say
that
the
aclu,
if
they
take
corporate
contributions,
if
they
get
involved
in
the
electoral
process,
they
are
a
conduit
for
these
corporations
to
put
money
into
the
electoral
process.
and
that
is
the
thing
that
congress
doesn't
want
to
happen,
that
is
the
thing
that
the
michigan
legislature
does
not
want
to
happen.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
yes.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
it's
totally
different
than
general
motors.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
pardon?
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
the
michigan
chamber
of
commerce,
i
would
say,
looking
at
it
on
a
spectrum,
the
chamber...
the
general
motors
at
one
end
and
mcfl,
that
type
of
corporation
at
the
other,
the
chamber
comes
some
place
in
between,
and
we
suggest
closer
to
general
motors
than
the
mcfl.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
they
have
been
established
by
business
corporations,
they
have
an
8,000
membership,
75
percent
of
those
members
are
business
corporations,
and
they
pay
dues,
they
pay
substantial
dues.
they
have
a
very
sound
membership
base,
and
a
very
sound
financial
resource
to
draw
on.
that
definitely
can
become
a
conduit
with
respect
to
the
political
process.
with
respect
to
mcfl,
the
case
this
court
dealt
with
earlier,
there
was
no
possibility
that
they
could
become
a
conduit
for
political
expenditures.
they
absolutely
refused
to
accept
any
money
from
business
corporations.
and
there
wasn't
any
threat
that
they
posed
to
the
electoral
process
whatsoever.
that
is
not
so
here
with
respect
to
general
motors...
i
mean
to
the
chamber
of
commerce.
now,
the
chamber
of
commerce
has
very
effectively
set
up
the
segregated
funds.
they
have
a
segregated
fund,
and
they
have
had
since
it
has
been
authorized
in
1976
by
the
michigan
legislature,
and
they
have
developed
kits
for
the
local
branches
to
use.
they
are
effectively
in
the
political
process,
but
through
the
separate
segregated
funds.
so
those
monies
that
are
used
by
the
separate,
by
the
chamber
through
the
separate
segregated
fund,
are
monies
given
for
political
purposes
and
not
for
some
other
purpose.
there
are
so
many
people
that,
corporations
and
business
entities,
that
join
general
motors
for
many
benefits,
and
they
may
not
want
to
associate
themselves
in
any
kind
of
political
activity.
but
if
they
are
permitted
to
make
independent
expenditures,
they
have
no
choice
in
the
matter,
because
they
face
too
many
disincentives
to
leave
the
chamber,
unlike
some
other
companies.
but
at
any
rate,
the
chamber
is
in
a
situation
where
they
can
have
a
serious
impact
on
the
political
process.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
well,
if
that
is
the
way
you
want
to
cast
it,
justice
scalia,
a
lot
of
speech,
i
suppose
that
is
true.
but
it
is--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--pardon?
i
didn't...
i'm
sorry--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--they
have
a
very,
their
presence,
a
corporations
presence
in
the
political
marketplace
is
very
formidable.
just
the
very
presence
is
formidable.
to
think
that
they
are
in
to
advocate
the
election
of
a
particular
candidate,
aside
from
the
fact
that
they
have,
some
of
these
business
corporations
generate
a
great
deal
of
money
that
they
can
inject
into
the
electoral
process,
i
say,
causing
an
unbalanced
playing
field.
they
nevertheless
are...
for
the
most
part
they
are
well
organized
and
they
can
turn
this
advantage
that
they
have
into
very
serious
problems
with
the--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--that
is
exactly
right.
as
i
have
mentioned
earlier,
justice,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
these
monies
that
are
put
in
by
the
stockholders
by
way
of
investments
is
for
economic
benefit
and
economic
gain,
to
earn
profits.
and
they
certainly
do
not
anticipate
those
monies
being
used
in
the...
to...
in
the
electoral
process
to
urge
the
election
of
a
particular
candidate.
and
they
have
free
speech
rights.
their
free
speech
rights
might
be
violated
by
the
fact
that
the
corporation
is
going
out
and
spending
monies
that
has
been
put
in
for
other
purposes.
they
may
not
want
this
candidate
elected
for
their
own
particular
reasons.
and
yet
their
monies
that
go
in
for
another
purpose
are
being
used
to
elect
some
other
candidate.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
any
corporation
within
the
state
of
michigan.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
think
it
is
any
corporation
doing
business
in
the
state
of
michigan,
and
that
may
include
corporations
incorporated
elsewhere,
that
is
true.
i
can't
answer
that.
but
in
any
event,
as
i
say,
the...
this
legislature...
this
court
has
historically
deferred
to
legislative
judgment
in
the
regulation
of
the
political
process
where
corporations
are
concerned.
they
have
perceived
that
there
is
a
potential
danger
and
a
potential
threat
to
the...
to
the
electoral
marketplace,
and
that
they,
that
deference
should
be
given
to
the
regulation.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
i
have
two
points
to
make,
and
the
first--
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
--the
first
point
i
would
like
to
make,
and
that
has
to
do
with
contributions
and
independent
expenditures,
and
the
difference
between
the
two.
this
court
has
said
that
contributions...
the
restriction
against
contributions
is
valid.
they
haven't
dealt
with
the
independent
expenditure
prohibition
in
term
of
corporations.
but
i
want
to
point
out
something
here.
there
is
a
difference
between
the
federal
statute
this
court
has
dealt
with
on
independent
expenditure
and
that
with
the...
and
that
set
forth
in
the
michigan
campaign
finance
act.
the
federal
statute
is
much
more
restrictive
than
the
state
statute
is.
in
the
federal
statute,
it
says
without
cooperation
or
consultation
with
any
candidate.
that
is
the
federal
statute.
but
the
state
statute
simply
says
is
not
made
at
the
direction
or
under
the
control
of,
which
simply
means
in
the
state
of
michigan,
on
independent
expenditures,
a
corporation
could
have
dialogue
with
a
candidate
and
say,
look,
i
am
going
to
take
out
these
ads
in
this
newspaper.
if
you
are
going
to
spend
money
there,
spend
it
some
place
else,
we
will
help
you
there.
in
the
federal
statute
you
cannot
do
that.
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
in
the
state
statute
you
can.
pardon?
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
pardon?
mr.
louis
j.
caruso
well,
even
the
feds,
even
the
federal
election
commission
takes
the
position
that
independent
expenditures
are...
should
be...
is
prohibited,
and
it
is
a
valid
prohibition.
one
other
thing
i
wanted
to
mention,
and
that
is
what
this
court
stated
in
national
right
to
work
at
210.
and
that
says
while
section
41b
restricts
the
solicitation
of
corporations
and
labor
unions
without
great
financial
resources,
as
well
as
those
fortunately
situated,
we
accept
congress'
judgment
that
is
it
the
potential
for
such
influence
that
demands
regulation.
nor
will
we
second-guess
a
legislative
determination
as
to
need
for
a
prophylactic
measure
where
corruption
is
the
evil
field...
feared.
differing
structures
and
purposes
of
different
entities
may
require
different
forms
of
regulltion
in
order
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
electoral
process.
and
i
mention
that
in
response
to
the
arguments
that
have
been
made
here
with
respect
to
labor
unions.
