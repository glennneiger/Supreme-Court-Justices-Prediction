you
suggest
that
there
are
no
limitations,
legal
limitations
on
how
much...
how
unions
can
use
their
funds
for
political
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
members
certainly
have
remedies,
don't
they--
justice
byron
r.
white
--under
the
federal
labor
laws.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
unions
really
aren't
all
that
free
to
just
use
their
amassed
wealth
to,
for
political
purposes,
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
unions
nowadays
usually
have
a
mechanism
for
that,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
of
course
you
want
to
be
able
to
use
your
accumulated
funds
from
dues,
you
don't
want
to
have
to
go
back
to
anybody.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
you
are
going
to
set
up
a
fund,
you
are
going
to
have
to
go
raise
some
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
may
not
be
able
to
raise
it
from
everybody,
because
they
don't
agree
with
you.
