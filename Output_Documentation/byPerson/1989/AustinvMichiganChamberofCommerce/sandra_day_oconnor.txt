do
they
not
pose
some
of
the
same
dangers

mr.
caruso,
there
is
some
kind
of
a
media
exception
in
the
statute.
can
the
corporation,
under
the
statute,
publish
something
that
would
include
some
candidate
endorsement
and
sell
it
as
a
magazine
or
distribute
it,
and
fall
under
the
media
exception?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
they
publish
something,
they
can
editorially
endorse
a
candidate.
