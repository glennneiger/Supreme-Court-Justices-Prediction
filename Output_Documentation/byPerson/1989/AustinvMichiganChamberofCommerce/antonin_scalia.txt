general
caruso,
why
is
there
a
greater
risk
to
the
political
process
from
an
independent
political
expenditure
by
a
family
corporation,
closely
held
corporation,
eight
family
members,
and
they
want
to
spend
the
corporation's
money
for
a
particular
candidate
whom
they
think
will
favor
their
business.
that...
that
is
prohibited
by
this.
but
if
donald
trump
wants
to
come
in
and
spend
as
much
money
as
he
likes,
that
is
perfectly
all
right.
why
wouldn't
it
make
much
more
sense,
if
you
are
worried
about
the
problem,
to
establish
an
amount
of
money
as
the
criterion?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
that
distort
the
electoral
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
that
distort
the
electoral
process?
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
what
the
evil
being
driven
at
here
is.
when
it
is
a
contribution
to
the
candidate
you
can
say,
well,
some
candidates
just
have
too
much
money
at
their
disposal.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
here
the
only
evil,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
there
will
be
too
much
speech
on
one
side
of
the
issue,
funded
by
vast
amounts
of
money.
is
that
right?
we
mistrust
too
much
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
danger
of
what?
it
depends
on
what
the
danger
is.
if
you
are
giving
the
money
directly
to
a
candidate
there
is
a
much
greater
danger
of
subverting
the
political
process
by
getting
some
commitments
from
that
candidate
that
you
wouldn't
otherwise...
that
you
have
no
entitlement
to.
but
here
we
are
talking
about
whether
a
corporation,
just
like
a
private
individual,
can
go
out
and
express
to
the
public
that
corporation's
view,
with,
i
assume,
indication
that
this
is
the
view
of
general
motors.
i
mean,
your
election
law
requires
that...
that
identification
be
given
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
you
think
that
is
a
threat
to
the
democratic
process,
that
the
state
is
going
to
be
swept
away
by
ads
signed
by
general
motors,
or
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
quite
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
people
are
getting
too
much
information.
that's
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
people
get
too
much...
they
get
talked
at
too
much.
that
is
an
evil.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
care
why.
what
is
the
evil
in
being
talked
at
too
much?
i
mean,
i
understand
the
evil
of
giving
money
directly
to
a
candidate.
it
is
close,
you
know,
could
be
very
close
to
a
bribe.
but
this
is
not
giving
money
to
a
candidate,
it
is
just
talking.
and
you
are
saying
that
that
is
an
evil.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
from
giving
contributions
to
religious
charities,
to
religions?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
it
prohibit
corporations
from
contributing
to
one
party
but
not
to
another?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
which
you
mean
a
lot
of
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
no
other
thing
that
you
are
directing
this
narrowly
at
except
that
they'll
have
too
much
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
there
is
no
other
element
of
a
corporation
that
accounts
for
the
legislature's
restriction
here,
except
the
fact
that
they
will
have
a
lot
of...
of
political
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
this
law
apply
only
to
michigan
corporations?
it
applies
to
all
corporations,
doesn't
it?
it
applies
to
all
corporations,
in
and
out
of
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
policy
you
are
just
defending
there,
i
mean,
that
is
a
sensible
policy
for
the
michigan
legislature
to
require
for
michigan
corporations,
i
suppose,
if
it
doesn't
want
the
shareholders
of
michigan
corporations
to
accept
unanimously...
use
any...
use
any
money
for
political
purposes.
i
can
understand
that.
but
they
are
imposing
this
upon
other
states
who
think
that
shareholders
generally
don't
mind
their
money
being
used
by
the
corporation
for
a
purpose
that
it
considers
valid
to
its
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
organization,
so
long
as
it
doesn't
endorse
a
particular
candidate,
wouldn't
violate
the
law,
or
seek
to
favor
a
particular
candidate.
you
could
still
campaign
with
respect
to
issues
as
much
as
you
like,
is
that
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
but
you
could...
you
could
publicize
the
issue
statewide
to
the
electorate,
not
just
lobby
in
the
legislature,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
you
don't
identify
it
with
a
candidate.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mclellan,
do
you
think
the
case
would
be
any
different
if
this
were
a
law
that
were
a
corporation
law,
that
is
michigan
made
the
judgment,
we
think
that
someone
who
takes
part
in
the
kind
of
an
economic
unit
that
we
want
to
allow
to
be
created
under
michigan
corporation
law,
should
never
be
bound
through
his
participation
in
that
unit
to
support
with
his
funds
a
particular
candidate.
are
you
incorporated
in
michigan,
by
the
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
michigan
made
that
judgment.
you
know,
we
set
up
this
economic
kind
of
a
unit
called
a
corporation.
we
don't
think
that
anybody
who
joins
it
ought
to
have
political
views
attributed
to
him,
and
therefore
corporations
incorporated
in
michigan
can't
endorse
a
particular
candidate.
would
that
be
any
different
as
far
as
the
argument
you
are
making
before
us
is
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
reason
is
we
don't
want
people
to...
people's
money
to
be
used
to
endorse
a
candidate
that
they
don't
like.
what
if
the
state
corporation
law
said
that
certain
types
of,
as
they
do,
certain
types
of
votes
have
to
be
passed
by
more
than
just
50
percent
of
the
shareholders.
suppose
that
it
said
to
endorse
a
particular
candidate
you
need
unanimous
shareholder
consent.
would
that
be
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
ought
to
fix
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
ought
to
fix
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
you
ought
to
fix
that.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
a
justification,
saying
therefore
we
have
to
prevent
corporations
from
making
any
contributions
at
all.
you
should
fix
it
the
way
the
feds
fixed
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
will
summarize
part
of
my
separate
dissenting
opinion.
it
sets
forth
the
reasons
why
i
think
today’s
decision
the
parts
from
both
our
case
precedent
and
logic.
infinitely
more
important
than
that
however,
is
its
departure
from
long
accepted
premises
of
our
political
system
regarding
the
benevolence
that
can
be
expected
of
government
in
managing
the
arena
of
public
debate
and
the
danger
that
is
to
be
anticipated
from
powerful
private
institutions
that
compete
with
the
government
and
with
one
another
within
that
arena.
perhaps
the
michigan
law
before
us
which
prohibits
corporate
campaign
speech
on
behalf
of
the
candidate,
perhaps
it
has
an
unqualifiedly
noble
objective
mainly
to
equalize
the
political
debate
by
preventing
disproportionate
expression
of
corporation’s
points
of
view,
the
governmental
abridgment
of
liberty
is
always
undertaken
with
the
very
best
of
announced
objectives.
the
premise
of
our
bill
of
rights,
however,
is
that
there
are
some
things
even
some
seemingly
desirable
things,
that
government
cannot
be
trusted
to
do.
the
very
first
of
these
is
establishing
the
restrictions
upon
speech
that
will
ensure
fair
political
debate.
the
incumbent
politician
who
says
he
welcomes
full
and
fair
debate
is
no
more
to
be
believed
than
the
entrenched
monopolist
who
says
he
welcomes
full
and
fair
competition.
perhaps
the
michigan
legislature
was
genuinely
trying
to
assure
a
balanced
presentation
of
political
views.
on
the
other
hand,
perhaps
it
was
trying
to
give
unincorporated
unions
not
in
substantial
force
in
michigan
political
advantage
over
major
employers,
or
perhaps
it
was
trying
to
ensure
a
balanced
presentation
because
it
knows
that
with
evenly
balanced
speech
incumbent
office
holders
generally
win.
the
fundamental
approach
of
the
first
amendment,
i
had
always
thought,
was
to
assume
the
worst
and
to
rule
the
regulation
of
political
speech
for
fairness
sake
simply
out
of
bounds.
what
about
the
special
element
of
corporate
wealth,
what
would
the
founders
of
our
constitution
have
thought
of
that?
they
would
have
endorsed,
i
think,
what
tocqueville
wrote
in
1835.
he
wrote,
"when
the
members
of
an
aristocratic
community
adapt
a
new
opinion
or
conceive
a
new
sentiment,
they
give
it
a
station
as
it
were
beside
themselves
upon
the
lofty
platform
where
they
stand
and
opinions
or
sentiments
so
conspicuous
to
the
eyes
of
the
multitude
are
easily
introduced
into
the
minds
or
hearts
of
all
around.
in
democratic
countries,
the
governing
power
alone
is
naturally
in
a
condition
to
act
in
this
manner,
but
it
is
easy
to
see
that
its
action
is
always
inadequate
and
often
dangerous."
governments,
therefore,
should
not
be
the
only
active
powers.
associations
ought
in
democratic
nations
to
stand
in
lieu
of
those
powerful
private
individuals
whom
the
equality
of
conditions
has
swept
away.
while
tocqueville
was
discussing
in
that
passion
in
that
passage
of
the
circulation
of
ideas,
in
general,
what
he
wrote
is
also
true
of
candidate
endorsements
in
particular.
to
eliminate
voluntary
associations
not
only
including
powerful
ones
but
especially
including
powerful
ones
from
the
public
debate
is
either
to
augment
the
always
dominant
power
of
government
or
to
furhter
impoverish
the
public
debate.
the
case
at
hand
is
a
good
enough
example.
why
should
the
michigan
voters
in
the
93rd
house
district
be
deprived
of
the
information
that
private
associations
owning
and
operating
a
vast
percentage
of
the
industry
of
the
state
and
implying
a
large
number
of
its
citizens
believe
that
the
election
of
a
particular
candidate
is
important
to
their
prosperity?
contrary
to
the
court’s
suggestion
today,
the
same
point
cannot
effectively
be
made
through
corporate
pacts
to
which
individuals
may
voluntarily
contribute.
it
is
important
to
the
message
that
it
represents
the
views
of
michigan’s
leading
corporations
as
corporations
occupying
what
tocqueville
called
the
"lofty
platform"
that
they
do
within
the
economic
life
of
the
state,
not
just
the
views
of
some
other
voluntary
associations
to
which
some
of
the
corporation’s
shareholders
may
belong.
despite
all
the
talk
in
today’s
opinion
about
corruption
and
the
appearance
of
corruption,
evils
that
are
not
significantly
implicated
and
that
can
be
avoided
in
many
other
ways,
it
is
entirely
obvious
that
the
object
of
the
law
we
have
approved
today
is
not
to
prevent
wrongdoing,
but
to
prevent
speech.
since
those
private
associations
known
as
corporations
have
so
much
money,
they
will
speak
so
much
more
and
their
views
will
be
given
inordinate
prominence
in
election
campaigns.
this
is
not
an
argument
that
our
democratic
traditions
allow
either
with
respect
to
individuals
associated
in
corporations,
nor
with
respect
to
other
categories
of
individuals
whose
speech
maybe
unduly
extensive
because
they
are
rich
or
unduly
persuasive
because
they
are
movie
stars
or
unduly
respected
because
they
are
clergymen.
the
premise
of
our
system
is
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
too
much
speech,
that
the
people
are
not
foolish
but
intelligent
and
will
separate
the
wheat
from
the
chaff.
as
conceded
in
lincoln’s
aphorism
about
fooling
all
of
the
people
some
of
the
time,
that
premise
will
not
invariably
accord
with
reality,
but
it
will
assuredly
do
so
much
more
frequently
than
the
premise
the
court
today
embraces,
that
a
healthy
democratic
system
can
survive
the
legislative
power
to
prescribe
how
much
political
speech
is
too
much,
who
may
speak
and
who
may
not.
for
these
reasons,
i
dissent.
