isn't
it
true
that
the
aclu
is
a
membership,
nonprofit
corporation?
justice

marshall
that
is
a
little
different
from
general
motors,
isn't
it?
justice
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
section
54(1)
of
the
michigan
campaign
finance
act
which
prohibits
corporations
from
using
corporate
treasury
funds
for
independent
political
happenings
in
state
candidate
elections
is
constitutional.
this
restriction
serves
the
compelling
state
interest
of
eliminating
the
coercive
effects
of
the
political
marketplace
of
great
amounts
of
wealth
that
are
accountable
to
the
income
of
the
corporate
report.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed.
justice
brennan
and
stevens
have
each
filed
concurring
opinions;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
oâ€™connor
and
scalia
have
joined.
