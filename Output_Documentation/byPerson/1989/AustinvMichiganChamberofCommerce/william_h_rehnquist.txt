chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
afternoon
in
number
88-1569,
richard
h.
austin
v.
the
michigan
chamber
of
commerce.
mr.
caruso.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
it
compare
with
the
michigan
chamber
of
commerce?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
a
nonprofit
membership
corporation
on
the
one
hand,
versus
a
profit-making
corporation
like
general
motors
on
the
other.
how
about
the
michigan
chamber
of
commerce,
which
is
the
corporation
involved
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what,
isn't
one
of
the
reasons
you
are
urging
why
corporations
like
this
were
treated
differently,
or
could
be
treated
differently
from
individuals,
was
that
the
stockholders
of
the
member
corporations
could
find
their
funds
put
to
uses
that
they
had
not
intended?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
caruso.
mr.
mclellan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
point
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
equal
protection
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
did
the
court
of
appeals
pass
on
equal
protection?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
explanation
of
why
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
did
not
need
to
reach
the
equal--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
all
we
ordinarily
require
to
reject
an
equal
protection
claim
is
some
sort
of
rational
basis,
and
isn't
it
enough
that
the
unions
are
unincorporated,
they
don't
have
the
freedom
from
liability
that
the
corporation
has?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
mclellan.
mr.
caruso,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
three
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
caruso.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-1569,
austin
versus
michigan
chamber
of
commerce
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
