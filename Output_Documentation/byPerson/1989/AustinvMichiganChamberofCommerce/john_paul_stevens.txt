do
they
do
that
through
their
own
funds,
or
do
they
set
up
separate
funds
for
doing
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
don't
have--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--they
don't
have
political
action
committees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
just
for
federal
elections.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
would
apply
to
the
use
of
funds
in
state
elections.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
can
make
all
the
arguments
you
want
to
your
own
membership
in
connection
with
soliciting
funds
for
your
political
action
fund?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
then
is
free
to
spend
the
money--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why
is
that?
i
am
a
little
interested
in
the
difference
between...
why
is
it
so
important
that
you're
not,
that
you
be
free
to
operate
without
going
through
the
fund
that
the
statute
provides
for,
the
separate
fund?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
problem
is
that
when
you
speak
with
your
own
voice
you
purport
to
represent
8,000
members
who
all
agree
on
your,
what
you
are
saying.
whereas
when
you
go
through
the
fund
you
are
sure
that
everybody
who
contributed
to
the
fund
authorizes
you
to
speak
in
that
way.
isn't
there
that
potential
misunderstanding
of...
i
mean,
that
is
why
it
is
stronger
speech
when
it
purports
to
represent
all
8,000
members,
even
though
they
haven't
all
contributed
to
the
fund.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
they
don't
all
have
to
vote
for
the
same
candidates
for
office.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
only
restricted,
but
if
it
weren't
restricted
it
might
be
misleading,
too.
what
difference
does
it
make
in
your
argument
that
you
speak
for
a
nonprofit
corporation?
can't
the
same
arguments
you
are
making
be
made
for
corporations
that
are
in
business
for
profit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
enquire,
what
do
you
mean
by
an
ideological
group?
i
can
understand
it
in
a
sort
of
a
single
issue
group
where
there
is
just
one
issue,
such
as
right
to
life
or
something
like
it,
very
clear
what,
that
they
all
have
the
same
approach
to
the
problem.
but
one
of
the
points
you
made
earlier
was
the
chamber
of
commerce,
by
its
very
nature,
is
very
diverse
in
the
various
interests
it
represents.
and,
sure,
everybody
is
in
favor
of
democracy
and
against
crime
or
something
like
that,
but
do
you
call
that...
is
that
enough
to
make
it
an
ideological
group?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
general
motors
be
an
ideological
group,
because
all
the
shareholders
want
to
make
money
and
believe
in
free
enterprise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
simply
because
they
are
a
profit-making
corporation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
there
be
any
nonprofit
or
membership
corporation,
i
guess
you
call
it
in
michigan,
that
would
not
be
an
ideological
group
within
your
concept?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
a
trade
association,
the
automobile
manufacturers
association,
or
something
like
that,
who
seek
to
promote
the
welfare
of
the
automobile
industry?
justice
john
paul
stevens
trade
associations
would
be
included
in--
