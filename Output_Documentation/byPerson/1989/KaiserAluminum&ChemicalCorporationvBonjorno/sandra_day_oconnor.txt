what
is
the
effect
of
the
appeal?
does
that
mean
that
the
right
to
post-judgment
interest
is
not
vested
during
the
appeal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
regardless
of
the
appeal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
congress
meant
that
it
would
apply
to
judgments
becoming
final
after
that
date.
true,
the
judgment
was
entered
earlier,
but
it
didn't
become
final
until
after
the
effective
date
of
the
new
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
no.
it
makes
the
date
from
which
it
runs
clearly
go
back,
but
it
perhaps
means
that
the
rate
of
interest
will
attach
according
to
when
the
judgment
became
final.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
are
two
cases
which
come
to
the
court
in
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
they
require
us
to
decide
the
applicable
rate
of
post-judgment
interest
and
the
date
from
which
that
interest
should
be
calculated
under
the
federal
post-judgment
interest
statute.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
requires
the
rate
of
post-judgment
interest
be
fixed
as
of
the
date
of
the
entry
of
the
judgment.
we
also
hold
that
post-judgment
interest
should
not
be
calculated
from
the
date
of
a
damages
judgment
which
was
set
aside
as
not
supported
by
the
evidence.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
has
affirmed
in
part,
reversed
in
part,
and
the
cases
are
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
white
has
filed
a
separate
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
which
justices
brennan,
marshall,
and
blackmun
have
joined.
