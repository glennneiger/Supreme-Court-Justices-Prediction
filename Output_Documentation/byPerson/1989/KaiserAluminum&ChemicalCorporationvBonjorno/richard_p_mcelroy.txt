mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
ask
the
court
to
reverse
a
decision
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
applying
the
post-judgment
interest
amendments
in
1982
retroactive
to
a
judgment
entered
against
kaiser
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
those
amendments.
the
decision
conflicts
with
prior
decisions
of
the
second
court...
fifth,
sixth,
seventh
and
ninth
circuits.
it
conflicts
with
six
years
of
prior
practice
within
the
third
circuit.
it
conflicts
with
the
practice
in
the
first
circuit.
and
it
conflicts
with
the
interpretation
given
to
the
statute
by
the
administrative
office
of
the
united
states
courts,
which
has
been
charge
with
the
obligation
of
administering
that
statute
by
congress.
the
petition
also
raises
the
question
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erroneously
ruled
that
judgment
can
run
from
the
date
of
verdict,
as
opposed
to
the
date
of
the
entry
of
judgment,
as
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
mandates.
this
case
comes
to
this
court
as
a
collateral
proceeding
for
an
award
of
interest
in
an
antitrust
case.
the
plaintiff
ultimately
prevailed
on
the
theory
of
liability
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act,
and
recovered
a
judgment
for
treble
damages
in
the
amount
of
$9.6
million.
that
judgment
was
originally
entered
on
december
4,
1981.
however,
the
judgment
was
vacated
on
kaiser's
motion
for
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict,
and
on
appeal,
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
directed
that
the
judgment
be
reinstated.
after
this
court
denied
certiorari,
with
justice
white
dissenting,
the
judgment
was
reinstated
on
july
2,
1986,
and
kaiser
paid
the
judgment
in
full
the
next
day.
the
plaintiffs
then
asked
the
district
court
for
an
award
of
interest
on
that
judgment.
that
proceeding
took
on
more
complications
than
normally
would
occur
for
the
calculation
of
interest,
which
should
be,
under
normal
circumstances,
a
simple
task.
it
was
complicated
by
the
procedural
history
of
the
case,
but
also
by
the
fact
that
after
the
original
entry
of
judgment
on
december
4,
1981,
congress,
on
april
2,
1982,
enacted
the
federal
courts
improvement
act,
which,
among
other
things,
amended
the
post-judgment
interest
statute
in
section
1961
by
changing
the
rates
of
interest
applicable
to
judgments
in
federal
court.
under
the
prior
statute,
interest
carried...
judgments
carried
interest
at
state
law
rates.
and
under
the
amendment,
interest
was
keyed
to
treasury
bill
rates,
which
are
auctioned
from
time
to
time,
and
therefore
change.
the
plaintiffs
asked
the
district
court
to
award
interest
from
august
22
of
1979,
not
the
date
of
the
judgment
on
december
4,
1981.
the
august
22,
1979
date
was
the
date
that
a
prior
judgment
had
been
entered,
but
which
had
been
vacated
by
the
district
court
because
the
district
court
found
that
plaintiffs
had
failed
to
prove
its
case
for
damages.
it
found
that
the
verdict
that
underlie
that
judgment
was
the
product
of
speculation
and
conjecture.
it
vacated
the
judgment.
it
was
never
reinstated,
and
there
was
never
an
appeal
taken
from
that
judgment.
kaiser
asked
the
court
to
award
interest
from
july
2,
1986,
the
date
that
the
judgment
was
entered
on
remand
from
the
court
of
appeals.
we
argued,
in
the
alternative,
that
the
court
could
award
interest
from
december
4,
1981,
the
original
judgment
date,
but
that
if
it
did
so,
the
interest
that
it
carried
should
be
at
the
interest
under
the
prior
statute
rather
than
by
the
amendment.
the
district
court
held,
however,
that
interest
shall
run
from
the
date
of
verdict,
which
was
december
2,
1981,
rather
than
from
the
date
of
judgment.
it
found
itself
bound
by
prior
third
circuit
precedent
in
that
regard.
the
court
also
ruled
that
it
would
not
apply
the
amendments...
retroactively,
because
to
do
so
would
result
in
manifest
injustice
to
kaiser
and
would
be
contrary
to
legislative
intent.
a
divided
panel
of
the
third
circuit
reversed
the
retroactivity
holding
of
the
district
court,
but
affirmed
the
remainder
of
the
opinion,
and
this
court
granted
certiorari.
this
case
presents
a
question
of
statutory
construction,
and
as
a
result
of
that,
congressional
intent
is
the
first
inquiry
of
this
court.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
precisely,
in
determining
legislative
intent,
your
honor,
the
first
question
is
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute,
as
i
said,
was
part
of
the
federal
courts
improvement
act.
in
section
402
of
that
act,
congress
expressly
stated
that
unless
otherwise
specified,
the
provisions
of
the
act
shall
take
effect
on
october
1,
1982,
six
months
after
the
date
of
the
enactment
of
the
statute.
this
court
has,
on
at
least
three
prior
occasions,
found
that
the
existence
of
an
effective
date,
and
a
delayed
effective
date
in
particular,
is
evidence
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
statute
to
apply
retroactively.
and,
in
fact,
it
makes
sense,
because
if
congress
had
intended
that
judgments
entered
prior
to
the
effective
date,
and
even
prior
to
the
enactment
date,
were
to
be
governed
by
the
amendment,
there
would
be
simply
no
reason
whatsoever
to
delay
the
effective
date
for
six
months.
congress
even
stated
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
reason
that
it
was
delaying
the
effective
date
was
to
permit
a
transition
period
for
the
bar
and
the
business
community
to
become
familiar
with
its
terms.
again,
a
purpose
that
would
be
wholly
meaningless
if
it
were
to
be
applied
to
judgments
entered
two,
three
years
prior
to
the
date
of
the
amendment.
in
addition,
when
congress
wanted
this
act
to
apply
to
pending
cases,
it
knew
exactly
how
to
do
so.
in
section
403
of
the
act,
under
the
title
effect
on
pending
cases,
there
is
not
one
reference
to
the
amendment
to
the
post-judgment
interest
statute.
there
are,
however,
other
provisions
of
the
act
which
congress
wanted
to
have
an
effect
on
pending
cases,
and
it
knew
how
to
express
its
intent
in
that
regard.
finally,
the
statutory
scheme
that
congress
adopted
under
the
act,
and
which
carries
forward
the
statutory
scheme
under
the
prior
statute,
is
to
award
interest
as
of
the
date
of
the
entry
of
judgment.
once
judgment
is
entered,
interest
remains
constant
throughout
post
trial,
post
judgment
proceedings,
through
appeals,
until
the
judgment
is
paid.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
the
right
to
post-judgment
interest
vests
as
of
the
date
of
the
entry
of
judgment.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
well,
it
is...
it
is
no
doubt
true
that
if
the
judgment
is
overturned
there
is
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
pay
the
judgment.
but
the
subject
matter
of
this
statute
is
the
rate
of
interest.
and
the
rate
of
interest
is
set
as
of
the
date
of
entry
of
judgment,
and
does
not
change,
no
matter
what
happens.
the
mere
fact
that
the
obligation
is
extinguished
by
the
fact
that
the
court
overturns
the
judgment
should
not...
does
not
change
that
rate.
and
it
is...
and,
what
i
was
going
to
say,
your
honor,
was
that
congress
quite
purposely
chose
that,
because
it
had
a
very
substantial
countervailing
concern
about
the
reliance
interest
of
defendants.
it
wanted
defendants
to
be
able
to
know
what
the
financial
impact
would
be
on
the
exercise
of
their
post
judgment
remedies.
and
to...
under
those
circumstances
it
is
implausible,
i
suggest,
to
ascribe
to
congress
an
intent
that
it
would
change
the
post-judgment
interest
on
a
judgment
entered
prior
to
its
effective
date
by
retroactive
application
of
the
law.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
yes,
your
honor,
because
of
the
way
the
statute
is
set
up.
as
i--
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
--the
post-judgment
interest
indeed
ran
after
the
date.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
because
it
frustrates
the
reliance
interests
of
defendants
in
knowing
what
their
financial
obligation
is
going
to
be
once
they
embark
on
the
process
of
seeking
to
overturn
the
judgment
against
them.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
well,
they
did
in
fact
intend
that
the
t-bill
rate
would
apply
after
that
date,
but
only
to
judgments
entered
after
that
date.
as
i...
as
i
stated,
the
statutory
language
is
interest
shall
be
calculated
from
the
date
of
the
entry
of
judgment.
at
that
time,
the
interest
is
set
for
all
time.
it,
once...
and,
it's
at
that
date,
the
date
of
the
entry
of
judgment,
that
defendants
are
relying
on
what
their
financial
obligations
are
going
to
be.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
if
the
statute
said
that
interest
runs
from
the
date
of
a
final
judgment,
i
agree
that
we
don't
have
a
question
of
retroactivity
here--
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
--oh,
i
don't...
i
think
that
is
clearly
contrary
to
the
express
language
of
the
statute,
your
honor.
the
rate
of
interest
attaches
as
of
the
date
of
the
entry
of
judgment,
and
it
makes
no
difference,
under
the
statutory
scheme,
what
happens
after
the
entry
of
judgment.
it
will
be
at
that
rate,
and
it
doesn't
change.
and
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
perversion
of
the
congressional
intent
to
say
that
we
are
going
to
determine
what
the
rate
is
as
of
a
particular
later
time,
when
congress
has
expressly
said
it
will
apply
as
of,
and
be
calculated
as
of,
the
date
of
the
entry
of
judgment.
that
that
is
the
proper
construction
of
the
statute
is
further
reinforced,
in
our
view,
by
the
way
in
which
the
administrative
office
of
the
united
states
courts
has
interpreted
the
statute.
under
the
amendment,
congress
has
charged
the
administrative
office
with
the
obligation
of
informing
federal
judges
of
the
appropriate
rates
of
interest
that
judgments
will
carry
in
federal
court.
on
july
27,
1982,
the
administrative
office
issued
a
memorandum
to
all
of
the
federal
judges
in
response
to
several
questions
addressed
to
the
office,
and
stated
that,
in
their
view,
the
statute
should
not
be
interpreted
to
apply
to
judgments
entered
prior
to
the
effective
date
of
the
act.
as
a
result
of
that,
the
practice
in
most
of
the
circuits
has
been
just
that.
there
has
been
reliance
on
that
memorandum,
and
despite
the
fact
that
six
or
seven--
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
--i
am
arguing
that
it
is
entitled
to
be
given
weight,
because
of
the
fact,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
congress
has
set
up
a
system
pursuant
to
which
it,
the
administrative
office,
has
an
obligation
to
inform
the
judiciary
of
what
the
rates
of
interest
are
on
judgments.
in
doing
so,
it
per
force
must
interpret
the
statute
to
determine
how
to
calculate
interest
under
the
scheme
that
congress
has
set
forth.
congress
has
stated
the
judiciary
shall
rely
on
what
the
administrative
office
says.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
it
is
the
last
sentence
of
the
statute.
and
congress
has
expressly
set
that
forth.
under
that
circumstance
it
is
entitled
to
be
given
some
weight,
but
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
not
only
didn't
give
it
deference,
it
doesn't...
not
even
deal
with
what
the
administrative
office
does.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
it
was
definitely
argued,
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
absence
of
legislative
intent,
the
court
has
before
it
two
competing
presumptions
of
statutory
construction.
under
the
court's
decision
in
bradley
v.
richmond
school
board,
the
court
has
said
that
courts
are
to
apply
the
law
in
effect
at
the
time
that
they
render
the
decision,
unless
to
do
so
will
result
in
manifest
injustice.
last
term
this
court
reaffirmed
the
long-standing
principle
of
statutory
construction
that
statutory
enactments
will
not
be
construed
retroactively
unless
their
language
requires
that
result.
the
courts
below
have
applied
the
bradley
standard
to
this
issue.
the
district
and
the
court
of
appeals
also
applied
the
bradley
standard,
and
we
believe
that
it
was
seriously
flawed
in
its
analysis.
and
i
would
like
to
go
through
that
at
this
point,
because
obviously
if
the
court
were
to
find,
to
agree
with
us,
that
its
analysis
was
flawed,
it
does
not
have
to
deal
with
the
additional
issue
of
these
competing
presumptions.
under
bradley,
this
court
stated
that
courts
must
look
to
three
factors
to
determine
whether
or
not
manifest
injustice
exists.
the
nature
of
the
parties,
the
nature
of
their
rights,
and
to
evaluate
the
impact
that
the
change
of
law
has
on
those
rights.
the
first
element,
the
nature
of
the
parties,
simply
requires
the
court
to
identify
whether
they
are
private
parties,
and
that
their
private
interests
are
at
stake
by
the
retroactive
application
of
the
statute.
this
factor
derives
from
chief
justice
marshall's
language
in
the
schooner
peggy
case,
that
courts
ought
to
struggle
hard
against
a
retroactive
construction
in
cases...
in
private
cases
between
private
individuals.
chief
justice
marshall
went
on
to
say,
however,
that
if
the
statute
touches
upon
a
matter
of
great
national
concern...
in
that
case
it
was
a
treaty
between
france
and
the
united
states...
if
a
statute
touches
upon
a
matter
of
great
national
concern,
then
the
private
interests
of
private
parties
should
give
way
to
that
national
interest.
in
applying
the
bradley
and
schooner
peggy
principles
to
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
acknowledged
that
this
was
private
individuals
involved
in
this
case,
but
then
stated
that
because
the
underlying
merits
claim
was
an
antitrust
case,
that
it
took
on
a
matter
of
public
interest,
and
therefore
there
was
no
impediment
to
the
retroactive
application
of
the
post-judgment
interest
statute.
we
believe
that
the
court
identified
the
wrong
statute.
if
a
statute
is
to
apply
retroactively
because
it
involves
a
matter
of
great
national
concern,
then
it
is
the
post-judgment
interest
statute
that
the
court
should
have
looked
to
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
involves
a
matter
of
great
national
concern,
thereby
justifying
retroactive
application
of
the
statute.
it
has
not
been
seriously,
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
has
not
been
contended
at
all
by
anybody
here,
that
the
post-judgment
interest
statute
involves
the
matter
of
great
national
concern.
the
second
bradley...
standard
was
the
nature
of
the
rights.
the
court
of
appeals
again
identified
the
wrong
thing.
it
said
that
the
plaintiff's
right
to
receive
interest
was
not
mature
and
unconditional
because
there
had
been
no
final
judgment.
and
therefore
there
was
no
impediment
to
the
retroactive
application
of
the
statute.
but
the
change
in
law
did
not
affect
the
right
to
recover.
the
change
in
law
affect...
affected
the
rate
that
would
be
applied
to
the
judgment.
and
the
rate,
as
i
have
indicated,
was
fixed
and
became
mature
and
unconditional
when
the
judgment
was
entered.
moreover,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
determining
manifest
injustice
you
should
attempt
to
identify
the
interests
that
are
adversely
affected
by
the
statute.
clearly
it
was
not
the
plaintiff's
interests
that
were
adversely
affected
by
the...
the
retroactive
application
of
this
statute,
but
it
was
the...
it
was
kaiser's
rights
to
a
certain...
to
pay...
kaiser's
obligation
to
pay
at
6
percent,
kaiser's
reliance
interest
on
that
being
the
rate
of
interest
that
would
be
applied
to
that
judgment.
once
having
identified
the
appropriate
rights,
having
fixed
as
of
the
date
of
the
entry
of
judgment,
it
is
clear
that
those
rights,
and
the
obligation
that
the
statute
imposed,
was
mature
and
unconditional.
the
third
bradley
factor
involves
the
analysis
of
the
impact
of
the
change
in
law.
in
this
case
it
was
a
$7
million
impact.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
the
once
the
law
was
changed
it
was
not
an
unforeseen
circumtance,
and
not
an
unforeseen
obligation,
that
kaiser
would
have
to
pay
a
higher
rate
of
interest,
because
the
state
may
be
applied
retroactively
to
the
judgment.
we...
this
is
circular
reasoning,
and
it
is
a
misconstruction
of
bradley.
in
bradley,
which
involved
the
statute
that
was
changed
which
awarded
attorneys'
fees
in
a
school
desegregation
case,
what
the
court
focused
in...
xx,
was
the
fact
that
there
were
two
independent
grounds
for
the
award
of
attorneys'
fees
in
school
desegregation
cases,
separate
and
apart
from
the
change
in
law
in
that
case.
therefore,
the
court
held,
that
even
as,
from
the
beginning
of
the
case
when
the
complaint
was
filed,
it
was
not
an
unforeseen
obligation
that
the
school
board
would
have
to
pay
attorneys'
fees
to
the
plaintiff,
even
though
that
statute
did
not
come
into
existence
until
after
the
entry
of
final
judgment
in
that
case.
that's
simply
not
this
case.
therefore,
the
court
of
appeals
picked
the
wrong
statute,
it
identified
the
wrong
rights
and
misapplied
the
impact
standard
of
bradley.
and
for
that
reason
the
judgment
should
be
reversed.
but
in
any
event
we
suggest
that
the
bradley
standard
of
statutory
construction
ought
to
be
reconsidered
by
the
court.
the
bowen
presumption
that
the
statutes
are...
will
not
be
construed
to
apply
retroactively
unless
their
language
requires
that
result,
in
our
view
is
a
better
standard.
the
manifest
injustice
standard,
although
if
all
of...
all
of
the
courts
applied
it
in
the
proper
fashion
and
applied
it
equally
would
have
the
same
impact,
the
reality
of
it
is
that
judges
do
often
disagree
as
to
whether
or
not
manifest
injustice
exists
in
a
particular
case.
and
you
need
look
no
further
than
this
case
in
order
to
find
proof
of
that.
two
judges
found
that
it
would
be
manifestly
unjust
to
apply
this
statute
retroactively
to
kaiser,
and
two
judges
held
that
it
would
not
be
manifestly
unjust.
and
precise--
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
--absolutely,
your
honor.
absolutely.
and
precisely
the
same
factual
situation,
a
judgment
under
the
antitrust
laws,
a
unanimous
panel
in
the
third
circuit
in
litton
v.
at&t,
found
that
it
would
be
manifestly
unjust
to
apply
the
statute
against
at&t
in
that
case.
it
simply
points
out
the
fact
that
the
manifest
injustice
standard
results
in
inconsistent
and
often
conflicting
statutory
obligations.
moreover,
the
standard
invites
constant
relitigation
of
the
same
question.
it
invites
a
case
by
case
analysis
of
statutory
construction,
which
i
believe
is
not
an
appropriate
one.
and
finally,
and
perhaps
most
importantly,
the
manifest
injustice
standard,
because
of
its
inconsistency
and
unpredictability,
defeats
the
reliance
interest
that
defendant...
that
parties
have
in
knowing
the
law
and
being
able
to
ascertain
whether
the
obligations
of
law
apply
to
them.
the
second
question
presented
is
whether
the
court
erroneously
adopted
the
date
of
verdict
as
the
date
to
begin
the
running
of
interest
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
the
date
of
verdict.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
the
statutory
language
is
interest
shall
be
calculated--
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
--i
don't
believe...
it
was
definitely
dealt
with,
because
of
prior...
and
i
think
the
court
cites
to
the
poleto
decision,
indicated
that,
and
the
poleto
decision
in
the
third
circuit
was
the
precedent
on
which
the
district
court
relied
in
choosing
the
verdict
date.
there
was
not
a
great
deal
of
litigation
over
this
issue--
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
--i
don't
believe
that
the
case,
the
issue...
the
issue
was
raised,
in
the
sense
that
we
were
arguing
for
july
2,
1981
judgment
date.
we
had
argued
that
an
appropriate
alternative
to
that
was
december
4,
1981,
as
an
appropriate
date.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
i...
i--
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
--the
difference
between
verdict
and
judgment
date,
i
do
not
believe
that
that
was
briefed.
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
well,
if
i
can
suggest--
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
--if
i
can,
by
way
of
explanation
as
to
perhaps
why
that
wasn't
briefed,
obviously
two
days
of
interest
doesn't
mean
a
great
deal.
but
what
happened
was,
after
the
decision
the
plaintiffs
raised
a
theory
of
construction
of
the
statute
with
respect
to
whether
the
auction
date,
or
the
settlement
date,
was
the
appropriate
date
on
which
the
interest
rates
changed
under
the
t-bill
calculation.
and
what
happened
was
that
under
their
novel
theory
of
interpreting
the
statute,
the
interest
rate
was
14
percent
rather
than
11
percent,
as
of
december
2.
and
on
december
3,
it
changed,
even
they
would
agree,
to
11
percent.
so
that,
at
least
potentially,
and
that
issue
still
is
out
there,
and
hasn't
been
decided,
potentially
that
issue,
the
difference
between
december
2
and
december
4,
is
a
$4
million
question.
and
obviously,
it's
a
matter
of
great
concern
to
us.
and
if
we
had
known
of
the
theory
that
they
were
going
to
advance,
we
certainly
would
have
briefed
the
argument...
briefed
the
issue
in
particular.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
rule
58
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure--
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
--says,
mandates
that
judgments
shall
be
entered
forthwith.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
that
means
as
soon
as
possible,
i
would
presume.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
well,
there
had
to
be
a
delay
in
this
case,
i
believe,
your
honor,
because
there
were
interrogatories.
there
was
not
a
general
verdict.
there
were
interrogatories
returned
by
the
jury,
the
court
had
to
approve
a
forum
of
judgment
order.
and
not
only
that,
because
the
judgment
required
trebling,
it
had
to
account
for
that
as
well.
so
there
had
to
be
a
short
delay.
i
think
that
the
judgment
was
entered
in
this
case
as
promptly
as
possible.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
you're
testing
my
memory
now,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
you're
right,
i
should.
i
will
say
wednesday,
but
i
am
not
sure.
i
think
it
was
the
same
week.
it
was
not
over
a
weekend
or
anything
like
that.
we
think
that
the
congress,
in
delaying
the
effective
date
of
the
statute,
meant
that
it
was
not
to
apply
retroactively.
we
think
that
the
majority
of
the
circuits
are
correct
in
not
applying
it
retroactively,
and
we
believe
that
the
minority
view
of
the
third
and
eighth
circuits
is
wrong.
we
urge
that
the
court
reverse
the
decision.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
p.
mcelroy
chief
justice
rehnquist
noted
that
this
was
complicated,
and
if
there
is
any
area
that
should
be
uncomplicated,
it
is
the
interest
that
judgment
should
carry,
so
that
we
avoid
prolonging
litigation
that
is
prolonged
already
forever.
justice
scalia
was
quite
right
that
the
billings
case
was
a
pre-judgment
interest
case,
that
that
case
involved
delay
damages
that
would
be
part
of
the
recovery
by
the
government
for
delinquent
taxes.
but
seven
years
later
this
court...
this
court
stated,
in
pierce
v.
united
states,
that
there
is
no
common
law
for
post-judgment
interest,
and
that
in
the
absence
of
statute,
interest...
excuse
me,
judgments
will
not
carry
interest.
rule
37
and
section
1961
have
to
be
read
in
harmony
with
one
another.
there
is
no
question
that
this...
the
interest
that
is
sought
to
be
recovered
in
this
case,
is
on
a
district
court
judgment,
not
on
a
court
of
appeals
judgment.
for
that
reason
we
think
that
the
court
below's
judgment
ought
to
be
reversed.
thank
you.
