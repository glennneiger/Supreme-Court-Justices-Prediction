chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-1595,
kaiser
aluminum
&
chemical
v.
joseph
a.
bonjorno,
and
vice
versa.
mr.
mcelroy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
the
language
of
the
statute
might
be
the
first
inquiry.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
unfortunately
for
you,
one
of
the
judges
was
on
the
district
court
that
ruled
your--
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
difference
there
is
because
of
fluctuations
in
the
rate
paid
on
t-bills?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
ought
to
remember
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcelroy.
mr.
reath,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we're
talking
about
a
fairly
technical
statute.
it's
talking
about
what
rate
of
interest
shall
be
and
when
it
shall
run
from.
i
don't
see
why
the
determination
of
liability,
without
a
judgment
entered,
should
be
critical,
when
the
statute
itself
conditions
the
new
rate
on
the
entry
of
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
argue
that
in
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
even
mention
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
under
your
calculation
of
this,
the
award,
of
a
rate
even
higher
than
t-bills.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can...
but
you
can
say
the
same
thing,
that
so
long
as
the
statute
provided
for
interest
at
state
core
rates,
which
were
often
5
and
6
percents,
a
defendant
had
an
advantage
to
appeal.
i
mean,
that
was
the
regime
for
a
long
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here
there
is
a
statute
on
the
subject.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
congress
did
not
mean
that
it
should
be
governed
at
the
time
of
entering
the
district
court
in
the
most
recent
enactment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
your
position
been
sustained
by
any
court
of
appeals
since
the
enactment
of
the
federal
interest
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
interest
statute
only
went
into
effect
seven
years
ago.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
what
point,
under
your
theory,
mr.
reath,
do
you
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
prescribed
this
other
interest
rate?
the
most
recent
appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so...
but
it
should
have
been
in
the
1984
proceeding
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
interest
was
fixed
at
the
rate
you
set?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
was
that
ultimately
decided
by
the
district
court
on
remand,
the
point
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
at
what
point,
in
your
view,
should
this
higher
rate
of
interest
begin...
have
begun
to
run?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
should
run
from
1986?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
my
question
is
when
should
it
have
begun
to
run?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
rule...
rule
37
says
if
the
judgment
is
affirmed
the
interest
provided
for
in
the
district
court
statute
is
the
rate
of
interest.
if
it
is
reversed
or
modified,
then
the
court
of
appeals
can
provide.
it
doesn't
make
much
sense,
does
it,
to
say
that
if
the
judgment
is
upheld
you
get
one
rate
of
interest
from
the
time
it
runs;
if
it
is
reversed
or
modified
you
get
a
different
rate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
isn't
the
necessary
result
of
the
language?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
rule
37,
though.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
sure
does.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
your
answer
to
the
question
that
there
are
two
different
provisions
in
the
very
rule
you
rely
on?
one
provides
that
interest
at
the
statutory
rate
if
the
judgment
is
affirmed,
the
other...
you
are
saying
a
different
rate
if...
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
very
strange
result.
and
you
have
to
go
outside
the
rule,
i
take
it,
to
show
why
the
rule
doesn't
obtain.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
provision
of
law
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
is
that
enacted
into
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we
should
read
unless
otherwise
provided
by
law
as
unless
otherwise
provided
by
law,
including
federal
common
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
reath.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
mcelroy,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcelroy.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-1595,
kaiser
aluminum
and
chemical
corporation
verus
bonjorno
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
