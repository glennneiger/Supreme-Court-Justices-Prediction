justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
not
asserting
that
the
administrative
office
of
the
u.s.
court
is
entitled
to
deference
on
this,
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
in
this
statute,
that
it
is
the
administrative
office
who
will
notify
all
of
the
courts
what
the
t-bill
rate
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
reath,
can
i
ask
you
about
that?
i
thought
that
billings
case
did
not
involve
interest
on
the
judgment,
but
it
involved
interest
as
an
added
penalty
for
failure
to
pay
the
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
federal
tax
statutes
do
provide
that
if
you
don't
pay
the
tax
you
are
subject
to
the
amount
of
the
tax
plus
interest
for
your
failure
to
pay
the
tax.
and
i
had
thought
that
that
is
what
billings
involved.
you
think
not;
you
think
it
involves
interest
on
the
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
billings...
mr.
reath,
here
is
what
billings,
the
case
you
rely
upon,
is
establishing
this
power
says
in
part.
delinquent
taxes
do
not
bear
interest,
unless
it
is
expressly
so
provided
by
statute,
but
it
is
competent
for
the
legislature
to
prescribe
the
payment
of
interest
as
a
penalty
for
delay
in
the
payment
of
taxes
and
to
regulate
its
rate.
and
the
case
goes
on
to
discuss
the
issue
of
whether,
not
you
get
interest
after
the
judgment
for
the
government,
but
whether
the
government
was
entitled
to
interests
from
the
date
the
tax
was
not
paid.
it
is
part
of
the
judgment,
not
interest
on
the
judgment.
so
do
you
have
any
other
cases
where,
that
might
support
your...
what
you
are
arguing
to
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
power
of
the
court
to
simply
prescribe
whatever
that
interest
might
properly
be.
