do
you,
do
you
think
it
is
applying
the
statute
retroactively
to
apply
it
to
the
period
of
time
after
the
statute
becomes
effective?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's...
after
the...
the
post-judgment
interest
ran
after
the
date
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
why
shouldn't
it
run
at
the
t-bill
rate,
for
that
period
at
least?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say...
you
say
that
congress
specifically
made
a,
made
the
effective
date,
they
postponed
the
effective
date
of
the
statute
to
october
1,
'82.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
argue
from
that
that
they
certainly
therefore
didn't
intend
the
t-bill
rate
to
apply
before
that
date.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
after
that
date?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
made
a
lot
of...
i
take
it
you
think
it
made
an
awful
lot
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
rate
changed...
the
rate
changed
after,
between
july
1
and,
or
between
december
2
and
december
4.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't...
do
they...
is
it
normally
assumed
that
a
judgment
should
be
entered
on
the
day
of
the
verdict?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
says
promptly?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
that
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
like
the
day
the
jury...
the
verdict
comes
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
day
of
the
week
did
it
come
in?
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
you
on
the...
on
this
market
rate.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
ever
a
judgment
entered
on
the
liability
verdict,
separate
from
the
first--
justice
byron
r.
white
--judgment
for
damages?
