mr.
mcelroy,
may
i
interrupt
you
before
you
get
into
that
argument?
i
notice
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
they
refer
to
december
2,
1981
as
the
judgment
date,
which
is,
as
i
know,
erroneous.
that
is
the
verdict
date.
and
i
don't
find
anybody
in
the
court
of
appeals
even
noticing
that
this
issue
was
in
the
case,
the
difference
between
verdict
and
judgment.
and
i
am
just
wondering
if
you
really
identified
and
argued
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
difference
between
the
two
days.
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
there
any
is
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
where
in
the
papers
before
us
do
we
find
that
argument
that
you
made?
i
couldn't
find
that
you
raised
them...
if
you
tell
me,
then,
i'm
sure
you
did,
but
i...
i
couldn't
find
it
in
the
record
myself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
just
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
notes,
maybe
i
mis-show
that
the
1979
judgment
was
for
$5,445,000.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
was
changed
to
the
extent
that
you
got
it
increased
a
couple
of
years
later
to
$9.5
million.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
it
is
not
correct
that
you
are
asking
for
interest
on
the
$5.4
million,
are
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
reath,
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--supposing
we
didn't
have
such
large
sums
involved,
we
just
had
an
ordinary
personal
injury
case
where
you
have
a
separate
trial
and
liability,
and
then
you
follow
it
with
a
separate
trial
on
damages.
is
it
your
view
that
the
rule
should
always
be
that
the
interest
runs
from
the
date
of
the
liability
verdict?
