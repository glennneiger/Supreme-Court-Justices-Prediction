mr.
henry
t.
reath
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
wrong,
your
honors,
that
someone
should
be
able
to
delay
for
14
years
full
restitution
from
the
date
they
destroyed
another's
business,
lose
every
appeal
in
the
courts,
and
still
end
up
having
the
jury's
award
against
them
reduced
by
two
thirds,
and
the
cost
of
their
long
and
losing
defenses
subsidized
by
the
winning
and
wronged
party.
yet
that
is
precisely
what
the
defendant
petitioner
seeks
at
the
hands
of
this
court.
that,
your
honors,
is
not
right.
it
is
wrong.
and
my
task
is
to
try
to
point
out
to
your
honors
how
this
court
can,
and
why
it
should,
set
that
wrong
right.
the
issue
in
this
case,
your
honors,
is
who
is
entitled
to
some
$18.6
million,
which
is
the
undisputed
value
of
the
cost
of
money
to
this
defendant
from
1979,
when
the
liability
verdict
was
first
entered
against
him,
and
never
thereafter
disturbed.
and
from
1979
on
that
is
the
only
finding
of
liability,
and
the
1981
recalculation
was
based
solely
on
the
1980...
on
the
1979
judgment.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
that
is
correct.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes,
sir.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
absolutely
not.
we
are
asking...
your
honor,
our
position
is,
and
i
think
we
have
set
it
forth
in
our
briefs,
and
i
think
the
justice
of
the
case
demands
it,
and
that
is
that
once
you
find
that
there
has
been
liability,
once
you
find
that
this
defendant,
through
willful,
intentional
and
predatory
acts,
destroyed
the
small
business
of
these
plaintiffs
and
drove
them
out
of
business
and
caused
them
harm.
that
was
decided
in
1979.
and
it
was
never
reversed.
they
tried
to
get
it
reversed,
they
tried
to
get
it
changed.
it
was
never
reversed.
what
the
lower
court
did
was
to
say
there
will
be
a
new
trial
limited
to
damages.
and
then
the
new
trial
came.
the
reason
for
the
two-and-a-half-year
delay
between
the
first
trial
and
the
second
trial
was
the
fact
that
unfortunately
the
district
court
judge
sat
on
the
case
for
that
long
period
trying
to
make
up
her
mind
as
to
whether--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--your
honor,
if
i
may,
and
what
i
would
like
to
take
my
time
to
do...
i
want
to
answer
any
questions
the
court
has
about
mr.
mcelroy's
presentation,
but,
as
you
know,
there
are
cross-petitions
here,
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute,
the
1961
statute,
does
not
apply
in
this
case.
that
this
court
and
the
courts
of
appeals,
under
rule
37
of
federal
rules...
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
not
only
has
the
obligation...
has
the
right,
but
the
obligation
to
give,
at
the
time
it
renders
its
opinion,
appropriate
instructions
with
respect
to
interest.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
absolutely,
we
did.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
i
know
that,
your
honor.
i
can
show...
we
argued
it
extensively.
the
briefs
were
extensive.
and
i
am
totally...
i
just
cannot
understand
how
they
dismissed
the
point
with
a...
with
a
single
line.
but
we
argued
it
most
vigorously.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
excuse
me,
sir?
no,
we
did
not.
we
just
felt
that
this
issue
would
have
to
come
on
to
this
court.
in
point
of
fact,
we
took
the
position,
and
your
honors
will
recall
this
from
the
petitions
for
certiorari,
we
took
the
position
that
we
would
be
willing
to
accept
the
treasury
bill
rate.
we
didn't
think
it
was
right,
we
didn't
think
it
was
enough,
but
this
case
has
been
going
on
for
15
years.
these
clients
that
i
represent
have
invested
their
time,
their
businesses,
their
personal
lives,
in
the
last
15
years
trying
to
work
this
thing
out.
they
were
willing
to
sign
off
at
that
point.
kaiser,
on
the
other
hand,
said
no,
they
wanted
to
petition
for
the
appeal,
in
which
event
we
said
well,
if
they
are
going
to
appeal,
we
want
to
appeal
also.
and
the
issue
that
i
would
like
to
focus
on,
if
i
may,
your
honor,
is
this.
if
you
recognize
that
what
the
fundamental
purposes
of
interest
are,
the
fundamental
purpose
of
interest,
we
have
set
them
forth
in
our
brief,
and
they
are
fourfold.
one,
to
preserve
the
value
of
the
award
against
it
diminution
over
time.
secondly,
to
disgorge
the
unjust
enrichment
that
flows
to
the
defendant
from
holding
on
and
having
the
use
of
the
plaintiff's
money.
the
third
is
to
vindicate
the
public
policy
considerations
of
the
congress
in
the
sense
that
when
a...
an
award
is
made
and
a
treble
damage
award
is
made
in
an
antitrust
case,
that
that
award
should
be
preserved
and
it
shouldn't
be
devalued.
and
the
fourth,
and
i
think
the
fourth,
justice
rehnquist...
mr.
chief
justice,
is
probably
one
of
the
most
important
of
all
facing
the
administration
of
this
court,
it
is
to
ensure
that
a
defendant,
by
appealing,
will
not
be
unjustly
enriched.
now,
what
we
have
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
by
virtue
of
the
fact
of
these
appeals
and
the
delay
and
the
ultimate
bringing
this
case
to
final
judgment,
you
have
the
defendant
gaining
at
market
rate
$18.6
million.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
no,
sir,
of
market
rate,
sir.
that,
and
they
do
not
dispute,
they
do
not
dispute
that
their
cost
of
money
throughout
this
period
was
market
rate.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
your
honor,
where
you
have,
and
i
think
that
is
the
very
reason
to
come
back
to
rule
37,
where
you
have
a
situation
such
as
the
present
case,
where
you
have
long,
extended
appeals--
if
your
honors
would
take
a
look
at
the
time
chart
that
we
attached
to
our
brief,
and
i
think
we
asked
the
court
to
take
a
look
at
it,
your
honors
will
see
there
that
there
is
an
incredibly
long
time
period
over
which
this
case
was
hanging
on
appeal.
now,
what
rule
37
says
is
that
where
the
court...
reinstates,
where
the
court
reinstates
an
earlier
judgment,
it
shall
give
appropriate
instructions
with
respect
to
interest.
now,
we
say,
and
we
have
cited
significant
authority
from
this
court,
that...
that
instructions
with
respect
to
interest
includes
not
only
the
time
period,
but
also
includes
the
rate.
the
question
of
what
is
fair
and
appropriate
under
the
circumstances.
for
example,
if
i
may
cite,
and
we
cite
it
in
our
brief,
your
honors,
the
case
of
young
v.
godbe,
one
of
the
earliest
supreme
court
decision
cases
on
the
question
of
interest,
decided
in
1872,
and
there,
in
a
unanimous
opinion
by
mr.
justice
davis
for
the
court,
had
to
decide
whether
or
not
the
court
had
the
power
to
award
a
rate
of
interest
where
there
was
no
statute
or
any
authority
for
them
to
do
so.
and
what
the
court
said,
it
was
a
case
involving
the
territory
of
utah,
and
what
the
court
there
said
was
this.
if
there
is
no
statute
on
the
subject,
interest
will
be
allowed
by
way
of
damages
for
unreasonably
withholding
payment
of
an
overdue
assessment.
the
rate
must
be
reasonable,
and
conform
to
the
custom
which
obtains
in
the
community
in
dealings
of
this
character.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
your
honor,
there
is
a
statute,
but
very
specifically,
that
statute
does
not
apply
to
judgments
and
orders
of
the
court
of
appeals.
under--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
congress
never
intended...
the
congress
never
intended
that
the...
that
either
this
court
or
the
court
of
appeals'
power
to
award
appropriate
interest
would
be
foreclosed
by
the
federal
interest
statute,
which
is
intended
for
routine
federal
district
court
judgments.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
absolutely.
oh,
you
mean
on
the
question
of
the
right
to
award
fair
market?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor,
that
it
has
been
raised.
and
one
of
the
reasons
it
hasn't
been
raised
is
because
over
time,
and
we
point
this
out
in
our
case...
in
our
briefs,
over
time
the...
for
a
long,
long
time
in
history,
both
the
t-bill
rate
and
the
federal
interest
rate,
the
6
percent
traditional
legal
rate
of
interest,
was
in
point
of
fact
above
the
so-called
market
rate.
it
has
only
been
within
the
last
10
years
or
so
when
we
have
seen
this
astronomic
increase
in
the
market
rate
that
this
question
has
become
much
more
significant.
now,
in
this
case,
your
honor--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--the
amendment.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
the
1982
amendment
to
1961.
but,
your
honor,
again
i
come
back
to
the
point
that
we
have
stressed
in
our
brief.
that
there
is
a
history
which
this
court
has
recognized,
going
back
to
the
original
judiciary
act
of
1789,
and
followed
through
in
cases
like
young
v.
godbe,
and
finally
in
the
billings
case,
which
i
would
like
to
refer
to
in
a
moment,
where
it
has
been
recognized
over
and
over
and
over
again
that
courts
of
appeals
and
this
court
are
not
bound
by
the
routine...
statute
for
awards
in
the
federal
district
court.
and
what
you
have
here
is
that
the
federal
court
obviously
made
a
serious
mistake.
the
federal
court
made
a
mistake
when
it
set
aside
the
$9.5
million
verdict,
tried
to
cut
it
in
half.
we
had
to
appeal
that.
we
went
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
reversed,
that
was
a
finding
that
there
was
liability,
that
the
liability
was
based
on
the
events
that
were
crystallized
in
the
1989
finding,
in
the
1989--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--excuse
me,
in
the
1979,
the
1979
finding.
and
that,
under
those
circumstances,
the
court
had
to
consider,
under
rule
37,
what
was
fair
and
appropriate
under
the
circumstances.
and
thus
the
question
of
appropriate
interest,
as
was
so
in
any
number
of
these
other
cases
that
we
have
cited,
the
question
was
does
the
court
itself
have
power,
does
the
court
have
to
look
to
a
delegation
from
the
congress.
and
let
me
read
to
you,
if
i
may,
sir,
from
the
billings
case,
which
justice
blackmun,
your
honor,
will
remember,
because
you
cited
that
in
the
ralston
purina
decision
that
you
had
when
you
were
sitting
on
the
eighth
circuit.
and...
let
me
find
it
here,
here
it
is,
in
billings.
in
billings,
your
honors...
billings
was
a
case
where
the
court
had
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was...
whether
or
not
interest
would
run
on
the
failure
to
pay
taxes.
and
the
failure
to
pay
taxes
backdated
a
number
of
years
until
the
final
decision
in
the
supreme
court.
and
the
two
questions
the
court
had
to
consider
was
one,
whether
or
not
there
would
be
interest,
whether
or
not
you
could
have...
whether
the
taxes
were
properly
imposed.
and
secondly
whether
interest
would
run.
and
there
the
court
held
that
both
you
could
collect
the
delinquent
taxes,
and
going
back
to
the
date
when
the
delinquent
taxes
were
first
due,
interest
would
also
run
from
that
date.
now,
there
was
no
specific
statute
that
would
have
covered
the
situation.
and
here
is
what
the
court
said.
thus
as
to
the
necessity
for
a
statute,
it
was
long
ago
here
decided,
and
i
am
referring
to
this
court,
in
view
of
the
true
conception
of
interest,
that
a
statute
was
not
necessary
to
compel
its
payment
where,
in
accordance
with
the
principles
of
equity
and
justice
in
the
enforcement
of
an
obligation
interest
should
be
allowed.
now,
that
was
precisely
the
situation
that
justice
blackmun
was
faced
with
when
he
was
on
the
eighth
circuit,
where,
in
the
ralston
purina
case,
it
was
a
case
where
the
defendant
had
won
on
a
counter-claim
in
the
first
instance.
the
case
went
up
to
the
appellate
court.
the
appellate
court
reversed,
sent
it
back
for
a
new
trial.
on
a
new
trial
the
defendant
again
won.
so
if
this
was
the
first
time
they
had
a
formal
judgment,
the
earlier
judgment
had
been
taken
away.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
no,
sir.
oh...
no.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
that
is
not
my
understanding
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
i
think
it
was,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
was
the
issue
that
the
court
had
to
concern
itself
with.
and
what
the
court
was
saying
was
we
do
not
have
to
look
to
a
federal,
we
do
not
have
to
look
to
a
statute.
now,
in
point
of
fact,
as
i
said
before,
i
was
going
to
refer
to
it,
and
i
will
refer
to
it
now,
your
honor,
the...
here
it
is...
28
u.s.
1961,
the
very
interest
statute
we
are
talking
about,
provides
specifically,
in
section
c(4),
this
section
shall
not
be
construed
to
affect
the
interest
on
any
judgment
of
any
court
not
specified
in
this
section.
now--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--your
honor,
in
1984,
when
the
court
reversed
and
reinstated
the
earlier
judgment,
we
could
not...
the
mandate
wasn't
going
down
because
kaiser
decided
that
they
wanted
to
appeal
it.
and
therefore
the
moment
that
it
came
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
1986,
when...
as
soon
as
the
case
came
back
from
this
court
in
1986
to
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
issue
its
mandate,
we
went
to
the
court
and
said
under
rule
37,
please
give
appropriate
instructions
with
respect
to
the
allowance
of
interest.
and
at
that
point
they
then...
then
a
stipulation
was
reached
between
the
parties
that
rather
than
have
that
issue
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals,
it
would
be
decided
in
the
first
instance
by
the
lower
court.
so
in
effect
the
lower
court
was
acting
as
an
agent
for
the
court
of
appeals
in
deciding
the
allowance
of
interest
under
rule
37.
so
that...
and
that
is
how
this
case
came
before
this
court.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
what
happened...
in
1986,
when
the
case
came
back
from
this
court
to
the
court
of
appeals,
that
is
when
the
issue
was
first
presented,
because...
and
that
is
what
the
court
below
found
in
its
opinion.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
that
is
right.
and,
respectfully,
your
honor,
they
were
wrong.
your
honor,
when
you
realize
that
the
value
to
this
defendant,
the
difference
between
the
t-bill
rate
and
market
rate
in
this
case,
over
the
full
period
that
interest
should
run,
is
more
than
$8
million.
now,
that
means
that
if
this
court
rules
that
it
doesn't
have
the
power,
it
doesn't
have
the
power
to
tell
the
court
of
appeals
that
it
has
the
power
to
award...
appropriate
proper
interest,
the
result
is
that
by
taking
these
appeals,
this
defendant
will
have,
as
a
bare
minimum,
saved
itself
$8
million,
merely
by
the
delay
of
time,
because
that
was
the
value
to
them
on
the
use
of
our
money.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
your
honor,
it
begins
to
run,
whatever
rate
of
interest
begins,
and
it
is
determined,
and
that
is
why...
it
should
be
when
the
final
decision
is
made
that
you
are
entitled
to
win.
it
wasn't
until
1986
that
we
had
any
right
at
all
to
any
interest.
and
that
is
the
reason,
among
other
things,
that--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--no,
sir,
you
deal
with--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--oh,
it
should
begin
to
run
as
of
the
date
of
the
judgment.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
the
1979
judgment
of
liability.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
your
honor,
there
is
another
provision
in
the
statute
that...
no,
i
don't
think
it
does,
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
that
is
not
the
necessary
result,
because
there
is
another
section
of
the
rule,
which
is
section
1912,
which
awards--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--no,
sir.
that
is
the
counterpart
of
37,
which
is
rule
38.
now,
38...
that,
there
are
three...
it
gets
complicated
because--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--it
gets
complicated
not
because
of
me,
your
honor,
but
because
of
the
overlapping,
the
overlapping
issues,
your
honor,
between
rules
of
court
and
the
statutes.
but
the
fact
comes
back
to
the
very
fundamental.
the
fundamental
issue,
it
seems
to
me,
in
this
case
is
does
or
does
not
a
court
of
appeals--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--your
honor,
the
first
sentence,
and
i
am
indebted
to
mr.
mazo
for
pointing
this
out,
first
sentence
of
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
rule
37
says
unless
otherwise
provided
by
law.
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
in
either
situation,
if
you
can
show
that
there
is
a
long,
extended
period,
an
unconscionable
benefit
flowing
to
the
defendant
from
the
result
of
a
long
period
of
delay,
that
the
appellate
court
would
have,
and
should
have,
the
power
to
right
that
wrong
and--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--the
provision
of
the
law
which
says
what
are
the
purposes
and
fundamental
reasons
for...
of
interest.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
that
is,
that
has,
is
part
of
the
federal
common
law
that
has
been
adopted
and
recognized
by
this
court.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
i
think
that
is
a
reasonable
and
permissible
interpretation
to
make,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
question...
the
question
here
is
does
the
power...
does
the
court
of
appeals
have
the
power
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
awards
that
come
out
of
its
court.
now,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
here
was
a
jury
which
said,
one
jury
said
this
defendant
was...
had
his
business
destroyed.
it
was
put
out
of
business.
it
is
entitler
to
be
compensated.
another
jury
said
it
is
to
be
compensated
in
the
amount
of
$9.5
million.
now,
the
question
is,
is
the
court
powerless
today
to
say
you
don't
get
the
$9.5
million
because
you...
they
have
been
deprived
of
the
use
of
the
money.
if
our...
if
the
market
rate
theory
prevails,
your
honor,
the
amount
of
interest
that
is
owed
is
$18.6
million,
the
amount
of
the
verdict
is
$9.5
million,
the
total
amount,
the
total
amount
of
the
claim
is
$28
million.
that
is
what
the
$9.5
million
in
1979
is
worth
today.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
other
cases
to
support
post-judgment
interest?
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
young
v.
godbe,
your
honor,
is
another
example.
that's
a
case
where
there
was
no
statute,
the
court
said
there
was
no
statute,
said
that
we
have
the
inherent
power.
the
same...
so
that,
if
i
may,
i
think
my
time
is
about
up,
i
would
like
to
just
get
back
again
to
say
two
points.
one,
there
cannot
be
any
issue
of
retroactivity
in
this
case,
because
the
right
to
interest
did
not
vest,
it
did
not
become
a
reality
until
1984
at
the
earliest,
and
1986
at
the
latest.
we
could
not
go
to
the
bank,
we
could
not
recover
a
cent
of
interest.
under
those
circumstances,
if
you
are
going
to
look
to
a
bradley
kind
of
analysis,
obviously,
as
the
lower
court
found,
bradley
would
say
you
apply
current
law,
unless
the
three
factors
are
met.
the
court
below
analyzed
those
and
pointed
out
why
they
don't
apply.
and
for
kaiser
to
come
in
and
say
that
there
is
an
elephant...
element
of
manifest
injustice
here,
where
they
knew,
your
honor,
in
1979,
when
the
congress...
the
first
attempted
effort
to
correct
the
disparity
between
state
rates
and
federal
rates
came
in
a
recommendation
from
president
carter
in
1979
in
february.
and
what
the
court
said
there
was
this.
we
can't...
excuse
me,
sir?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
no.
this
was
president
carter
to
the
senate,
stated...
stated
to
the
senate
that
the
time
would
come
that
1961
should
be
changed,
because
of
the
great
disparity
between
state
rates
and
true
market
rates.
and
what
they
point
out
there
was
that
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
court
has
to
be
so
concerned
about
this
issue
is
because
you
cannot
provide
an
incentive
for
delay
by
permitting
one
defendant
to
delay,
and
he
pays...
his
cost
of
money
is
up
here
at
market,
and
he
pays
a
submarket
rate,
and
he
uses
the
difference
between
the
two
to
subsidize
the
cost
of
his
appeal.
in
this
case,
i
come
back
to
the
point
we
xx
earlier,
kaiser
has
benefitted
to
the
extent
of
$18.6
million
from
the,
from
having
the
use
of
our
money--
mr.
henry
t.
reath
--since
1979.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes,
your
honor,
and
that
was
precisely
what
happened
in
the
mascuilli
case
which
we
cite
out
of
the
third
circuit.
and
i
think
what
was
said
in
that
case
is
particularly
germane
to
this
issue,
because
there
the
court
had
a
long
period
of
time
between
the
liability
and
the
final
award,
and
it
said...
the
court
said
this,
the
lower
court,
which
was
affirmed
by
the
third
circuit.
plaintiff
became
entitled
to
interest
as
of
the
day
the
final
judgment
on
liability
was
tendered
in
1968.
it
would
be
inequitable
to
impose
the
costs
associated
with
the
use
of
money
on
her
rather
than
on
the
defendant,
whose
wrongful
conduct
resulted
in
the
invocation
of
the
judicial
process,
and
who
had
the
use
of
the
money
during
the
pendency
of
those
various
appeals.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
in
this
case?
mr.
henry
t.
reath
in
this
case?
yes,
there
was.
there
was
a
judgment,
and
then
the
judgment
was
set,
put
aside
by
the
lower
court
and
was
never
reinstated.
it
should
have
been.
mr.
henry
t.
reath
yes,
your
honor.
