unknown
speaker
and
now
is--
--are
you
saying
you
could
right
now
go
back
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
have
your
claim
considered
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
with...
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
know
how
to
apply
texas
law
properly,
i
would
think.
unknown
speaker
so
do
you
suggest
we
vacate
and
remand?
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
be
raising
in
the
state
court
arguments
that
you
have
not
raised
previously
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
no.
as
to
the
procedural
bar.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
we
have
jurisdiction
if
you
haven't
argued
it
to
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
did
the...
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
you
were
procedurally
barred
in
this
case.
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--and
you're
saying
that
subsequent
developments
in
texas
law
after
they
ruled
would
lead
anybody
to
say
that
you're
no
longer
procedurally
barred?
unknown
speaker
well,
surely
the
fifth
circuit
is
better...
in
a
better
position
to
know
than
we
are
whether
there's
been
a
change
in
the
law
of
the
texas
procedural
bar.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--was
penry...
was
penry
after
the
court
of
appeals'--
unknown
speaker
--decision
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
penry
then
is
really
the
key
to
why
this
situation
has
changed.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
know
what
the
court
of
appeals
would
say
if
it
had
an
issue
like
this
before
it
now.
unknown
speaker
the
fifth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
but
they
haven't
had
any
chance
to
say
that
again
since
penry?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
the
state
argue
abuse
of
the
writ
for
your
not
arguing
this
sooner
or--
unknown
speaker
--well,
even
if
you--
unknown
speaker
--even
if
you're
right,
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
teague
on
the
penry
claim,
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
penry
decided
it
wasn't
a
new
rule.
i
mean,
it
was
applying
existing
law,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
a
retroactivity
decision
at
all.
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
question
of
determining
that
that
was
the
existing
state
of
the
law.
unknown
speaker
now,
your
cert.
petition
didn't
raise
this
procedural
question?
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
certain
irony...
a
certain
irony
in
your
argument
if
what
you're
saying
is
that
you
would
argue
to
the
texas
court
that
penry
was
a
change
in
the
law.
and
yet
we
held
in
penry
that
it
was
not
a
change
in
the
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean,
state...
state
law
is
not
governed
by
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
why
should
you
be
excused
from
raising
the
federal
constitutional
claim
or
why
should
your
client
be
excused
from
failing
to
raise
the
federal
constitutional
claim
that
would
have...
that
would
have
been
a
winner
under
penry?
unknown
speaker
well,
penry
raised
it,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
how
did
he
have
enough
foresight
to
raise
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
in...
as
we...
you
say
that
teague
was
no
problem
because
penry
was
old
law,
anybody
should
have
known
it.
yeah.
unknown
speaker
but
our
cases
have
said
that
futility
is
no
reason
for
failing
to
object.
unknown
speaker
then
you're...
you're
really
saying
it
would
have
been
futile
to
take
that
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals.
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
futility
described
in
our
cases
where
we're
talking
about
wainwright
against
sykes.
unknown
speaker
just
the
fact
that
you
don't
think
the
highest
court
of
the
state
would
have
accepted
your
argument
doesn't
mean
you're...
you're
excused
from
making
it.
unknown
speaker
just
as
you
haven't.
unknown
speaker
after
penry
it
was
clear
that
that
was
wrong?
unknown
speaker
and...
and
you
didn't
go
back
to
state
court--
unknown
speaker
--once...
once
it
was
clear
that
it
was--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
your...
your
argument
about
that
has
been
eroded.
you
keep
relying
on
the
state
law
ground.
but
the
adequacy
of
the
procedural
default
rule
is
a
federal
question.
unknown
speaker
and
if...
if,
as
a
federal
matter,
this
constitutional
rule
of
penry
was
perfectly
foreseeable,
i
don't
know
why
the
state,
if
it
wanted
to,
couldn't
rely...
couldn't
insist
that
you
raise
it
in
the
trial
court.
if
there
is
some
state
law
basis
for
saying,
well,
we
don't
want
to
enforce
this
rule
any
more,
why,
they
don't
have
to.
but
i
don't
know
why...
why
is
as
a
federal
constitutional
matter
this
rule
isn't...
isn't
an
adequate
one.
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't--
unknown
speaker
--we
don't
know
that
you're
right
about
your...
your
state
law
rule,
do
we?
unknown
speaker
that
should
be
[inaudible]
court
of
appeals
to...
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
can't...
we
can't
remand
it
to
them.
unknown
speaker
there
is
also
a
procedure
to
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
look
at
it
in
the
first
instance
since
there--
unknown
speaker
--has
been
a
decision--
unknown
speaker
--since
then
that
you
claim
makes
a
difference.
unknown
speaker
no.
there's
been
a
decision
here
that...
that
might
have--
unknown
speaker
--might
lead
to
a
different
result
than
the
court
of
appeals--
unknown
speaker
--well,
then
it
would
have
to...
we'd
have
to
wait
for
them.
then
it
would
have
to
come
back
here.
unknown
speaker
and
the
court
of
appeals
might
solve
it
all
for
you.
unknown
speaker
why
are
they--
unknown
speaker
--why
are
they
waiting?
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
you
say
that
there
is
a
state
law
rule.
there
must
not
be
if
they're
waiting.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
we
shall
wait
for
them.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
we
certainly
have
waited
long
enough
in
this.
unknown
speaker
mr.
burr--
unknown
speaker
--can
i
ask
you...
you're
describing,
and
let's
assume
it
does
exist...
a
state
law
rule
which
says
that
even
though
you
should
know
enough
from
supreme
court
cases
to
raise
the
issue,
nonetheless,
if
we
have
been
erroneous
enough
to
reject
that
claim
in
the
past,
you
don't
have
to
raise
it
before
us.
right?
that's--
unknown
speaker
--yeah.
unknown
speaker
now,
you--
unknown
speaker
--you
would
acknowledge
that
had
your
client
sought
a
direct
appeal
from
the
decision
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
we
would
have
rejected
it
because
the
federal
issue
had
not
been
preserved
below,
right?
but
you're
saying
that
when
he
next
goes
into
federal
habeas
we
should
entertain
the
same
issue.
unknown
speaker
why?
but
i
think
you
are.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
we
would
have
rejected
it.
we
would
have
said
it's...
it's
old
law,
you
should
have
raised
it
below,
wouldn't
we?
isn't
that
what
we
would
have
said?
unknown
speaker
so
we
would
have
said
you...
we
won't
entertain
it
since
you
didn't
raise
it
below.
unknown
speaker
we
wouldn't
say
that?
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
that
if
the
federal
court...
if...
if
the
state
court
would
have
entertained
it,
we
would...
we
would
entertain
it
even
though
we
thought
it
was
old
law?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
xxx
file
a
new
petition
for
collateral
relief
in
texas.
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
say
if
the...
if
the
texas
court,
different
from
what
you
think...
how
you
think
it
would
answer,
came
back
and
said,
well,
the...
there
was
no
good
excuse
for
not
raising
the
issue
at
the
time
and
we
haven't
changed
our
mind?
unknown
speaker
then...
then
would
we...
would
you
be
in
a
position
to
have
us
say
that
it
was
not
an
adequate
statement
of--
unknown
speaker
--what
are
you
doing
to...
what
are
you
talking...
cause
for
what
now?
unknown
speaker
cause
for
what?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
burr.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
walt,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
walt--
unknown
speaker
--both
you
and
mr.
burr
have
referred
to...
is
it
a
texas
decision
in
ex
parte
chambers?
is
that
what
you're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
when...
when
was
it
decided?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
the
fifth
circuit,
though,
would
have
had
chambers
when
it
decided
the
present
case,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
but
it
didn't
have
penry
then?
unknown
speaker
to...
to
what
extent
did
selvage
concede
that
there
had
been
procedural
default?
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
in
a
pleading
filed
with
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
possibility
that
that
is
the
situation
in
texas?
unknown
speaker
these
are
decisions
of
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals?
unknown
speaker
since
penry?
unknown
speaker
and
so
in
circumstances
similar
to
this
case,
they
imposed
the
procedural
bar
despite
penry?
unknown
speaker
is
the
pending
case...
i
believe
it's
called
harvey...
on
all
fours
with
those
case...
cases?
unknown
speaker
is
that
case
still
pending
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's...
if
it's
already
been...
if
the
same
issue
has
already
been
decided
in
two
other
cases,
why
are
they
holding
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
you've
said
that
since
penry
they've
just...
they've
imposed
the
procedural
bar
despite
penry
in
cases
just
like
this.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
that
if
the
previous
cases
were
controlling,
you'd
think
that
harvey
would
just
be
immediately
issued.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
other
cases
you
just
mentioned--
unknown
speaker
--since
penry?
unknown
speaker
what's...
what's
the
name?
unknown
speaker
and...
and...
procedural
bar
was--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
was
since
penry?
unknown
speaker
and
what's
the
other
case
you
mentioned?
unknown
speaker
were
there...
were
there
opinions
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
and
pastor
and
woods
both
unpublished?
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
petition
for
cert.
in
wood?
unknown
speaker
well,
did
he
raise...
that
was
long
before
penry?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
well,
all
right.
on
direct
appeal
it
was
before
penry?
unknown
speaker
is
it...
is
it
100
percent
certain
that
if
we
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
that
for
present
purposes
we'll
assume
that
the
court
below
figured
out
the
texas
court
correctly,
what
the
texas
rule
was
about
default?
is
it
100
percent
certain
that
if
that
is
wrong,
this
defendant
can
go
back
into
the
texas
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
problem
is
how
to
apply
that
in
the
capital
sentencing
context.
how
does
that
point--
unknown
speaker
--that's
the
difficulty.
