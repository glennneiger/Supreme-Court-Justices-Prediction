mr.
richard
h.
burr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
in
the
case
of
johnny
paul
penry,
the
jury
that
sentenced
john
selvage
to
death
did
so
without
being
able
to
consider
or
give
effect
to
the
mitigating
circumstances
he
proffered.
unlike
penry's
lawyers,
however,
john
selvage's
lawyers
did
not
object
to
this
constitutional
defect
in
his
sentencing
proceeding.
as
a
result,
when
the
pre-penry
claims
in
both
of
these
cases
got
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
texas,
in
the
penry
case
the
court
denied
the
claim
on
the
merits,
and
in
mr.
selvage's
case
the
court
denied
the
claim
on
the
basis
of
the
procedural
default
at
trial,
the
failure
to
object.
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
whether
the
court
of
criminal
appeals'
ruling
should
prevent
the
federal
habeas
courts
from
deciding
the
merits
of
mr.
selvage's
penry
claim.
when
this
question
was
first
presented
to
this
court
in
mr.
selvage's
cert.
petition
which
was
filed
back
in
march
of
1988,
no
issue
was
raised
concerning
the
adequacy
of
the
state
procedural
ruling.
since
that
time,
however...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
15
months
after
that
time...
when
this
court
announced
its
decision
in
penry
at
the
end
of
june
1989,
and
as
a
result
of
the
penry
decision,
there
is
now
no
state
ground
barring
review
of
the
merits
of
the
claim.
accordingly,
in
the
time
since
the
question
was
first
presented
in
our
cert.
petition
to
the
court,
a
new
threshold
question
has
arisen:
whether
the
default
ruling
in
the
state
courts
is
now
based
on
an
adequate
state
ground.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
your
honor,
we
believe
that
if
texas
law
is
applied
properly,
we
could
do
that.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
i
would
suspect
they
would.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
court
is
in
a
position,
because
of
the
clarity
of
texas
law
and
because
of
the
posture
in
which
this
case
is
in...
we
are
here
on
a
federal
habeas
proceeding
with
the
merits
not
having
been
reached
because
of
the
default
ruling...
this
court
certainly
has
the
power,
and,
indeed,
has
usually
given
itself
the
obligation
to
determine
whether
the
procedural
ruling
is
an
adequate
state
ruling.
the
court
could
look
at
state
law,
determine...
and
we
would
ask
that
the
court
do
this...
that
the
ruling
is
no
longer
an
adequate
state
ground
and
hold
that
there
is
no
default
which
bars
consideration
of
claim.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
not
as
to
the
merits
we
would
not.
the
merits
were
presented
in
the
state
court.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
we
would.
the
reason
for
that--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--justice
kennedy,
the
reason
for
that
is
this.
the
procedural
rules
in
texas
at
the
time
that
the
penry
case
was
decided,
as
a
result
of
those
rules
excused
the
procedural
default
at
trial.
for
that
reason,
the...
the
ruling
of
the
federal
courts,
which
was
based
on
that
default,
is
now
no
longer,
we
submit,
an
adequate
ruling
because
there
is
no
default.
so,
as
a
matter
of
federal
habeas
procedure,
we
are
here
on
a
federal
habeas
petition
on
a
defaulted
claim.
there
is
certainly
a
federal
interest
in
deciding
whether
there
is
still
a
viable
state
ground
for
this
decision.
if
not...
and
we
submit
this
court
is
empowered
and
certainly
because
of
the
state
of
texas
law
ought
to
go
ahead
and
decide
the
issue.
if
there
is
no
default,
then
the
merits
ought
to
be
determined
in
the
federal
proceeding.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
subsequent
developments
from
this
court's
decision
and
how
that
dovetails
with
texas
law.
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
your
honor...
excuse
me...
i
don't
think
so
for
a
couple
of
reason.
the
rules
of
state
law
which
are
applicable
here,
we
submit,
are
plain
and
unequivocal.
if
there
was
any
doubt
so
that
deference
to
the
lower
federal
courts
who
are
closer
to
the
state
law
might
be
or
benefit,
then
i
would
certainly
agree
with
you.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
but
there
is
no
ambiguity--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--yes.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
yes,
it
was.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
penry
is
the
triggering
event.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
the
fifth
circuit
or
the
court
of
criminal
appeals?
mr.
richard
h.
burr
the
fifth
circuit,
we
would
certainly
argue,
that
they
ought
to
do
as
this
court
should
do,
that
they
should
find
that
there
is
no
longer
an
adequate
state
ground
on
the
basis
of
texas
procedural
rules.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
they
have
not.
not
to
my
knowledge.
certainly
not
in
our
case,
and
to
my
knowledge,
they
have
not
had
that
opportunity
in
any
other
case.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
the
state
did
argue
abuse
of
the
writ
in
the
federal
district
court
and
in
the
fifth
circuit.
it
has
not
argued
that
before
this
court.
so
my
guess
is
that...
i
certainly
don't
want
to
suggest
something
to
the
state,
but--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--it
probably
would.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
your
honor,
teague,
as
the
court
knows
in
penry,
the
penry
decision
was
held
to
be
retroactive,
so
there
would
be
no
teague
problem
in
terms
of
retroactivity.
the
penry
rule
would
apply
because
penry
itself
decided
that
the
rule
would
be
retroactively
applied.
so,
there
is
no
teague
problem.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
yes,
justice
o'connor,
that's--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--no,
no.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
that's
correct.
so
it's
my
understanding
under
the
principles
of
teague
and...
and
other
cases
addressing
retroactivity
that,
because
it's
not
a
new
rule
of
law,
persons
like
mr.
selvage
could
have
the
benefit
of
the
penry
substantive
ruling.
let
me
review,
if
i
could,
for
just
a--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--it
did
not,
justice
o'connor,
for
one
reason.
at
the
time
that
we
filed
our
petition,
which
was
back
in
march
of
1988,
neither
franklin
had
been
decided
nor
penry.
and
until
actually
penry
was
decided,
the
state
procedural
rule
which
forgives
a
prior
failure
to
object
was
not
triggered.
it...
it
was
triggered
only
by
this
court's
ruling
at
the
end
of
last
june
in
penry.
let
me
describe
that
procedural
rule
for
a
moment,
if
i
could.
it
is
probably
most
often
quoted
from
a
case
called
ex
parte
chambers.
the
court
has
formulated
the
rule
in
chambers
as
follows,
and
i
quote.
"a
defendant
has
not
waived
his
right
to
assert
a
constitutional
violation
by
failing
to
object
at
trial
if
at
the
time
of
his
trial
the
right
had
not
been
recognized.
"
now,
that
rule
has
been
applied
according
to,
we
submit,
four
parameters.
first
of
all,
the
court
has
made
plain
that
it
applies
if
a
supervening
subsequent
decision
of
this
court
recognizes
a
claim
which
at
the
time
of
trial
would
have
been
novel...
novel
in
the
sense
of
reed
v.
ross...
that
the
constitutional
theories
and
principles
were
simply
not
available
to
put
the
claim
together.
that
is
not
our
case.
the
second
parameter
where
chambers
forgives
a
prior
default
is
that
if
the
claim
is,
as
the
state
courts
put
it,
futile.
and
what
the
state
courts
in
texas
mean
by
futile
is
that
the
tools
were
there
to
make
the
claim.
it
had
been
made
on
all
the
constitutional
grounds
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
categorically
rejected.
at
that
point
texas
law
does
not
require
that
a
defendant
continue
raising
claims
that
it
has
categorically
rejected
with
no
new
theory
available.
in
that
situation...
indeed,
that
was
the
situation
in
which
the
chambers
case
was
decided...
it
involved
the
smith
v.
estelle
error
where
prior
to
smith
v.
estelle
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
categorically
rejected
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
claims
based
upon
psychiatric
testimony
concerning
future
dangerousness.
after
smith
v.
estelle
came
down,
in
chambers
in
a
state
habeas
proceeding
in
a
case
which
had
not
raised
this
issue
at
trial,
the
court
granted
relief,
holding
that
smith
v.
estelle
was
the
precise
kind
of
change
in
law
from
this
court
which
triggers
this
exception
to
the
procedural
default--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--certainly
from
the
perspective
of
state
law,
justice
rehnquist,
it
was
a
change.
up
until
penry--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--no.
not
at
all.
from
the
perspective
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals'
application
of
the
eighth
amendment,
they
had
been
up
until
penry...
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
had
categorically
rejected
every
eighth
amendment
argument.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
well,
your
honor,
it
would
have
been
a
winner
under
penry
after
penry.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
penry
did.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
a
handful
of
lawyers
did
keep
raising
this
claim,
both
in
the
texas
courts
and
in
federal
habeas.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the...
the
reconciliation
between
the
teague
aspect
of
penry
and
the
argument
we're
making
here
is
this.
as
the
majority
recognized
in
penry,
the
principles
embodied
in
jurek,
woodson
and
lockett
were
the
principles
which
controlled
the
ruling
in
penry.
and
for
that
reason
there
was
no
evolution
of
legal
principle.
there
was
simply
an
application
of
those
principles
to
the
peculiar
factual
situation
of
penry's
case.
so,
for
that
reason
it
was
not
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
law.
now,
at
the
time
of
trial...
indeed,
well
before
trial...
after
this
court's
opinion
in
jurek,
trial
lawyers
in
texas
began
complaining
that
the
texas
scheme
precluded
the
consideration
of
mitigating
circumstances.
when
those
circumstances
were
not
relevant
in
a
mitigating
way
to
the
special
issues,
they
didn't
get
considered.
that
claim
was
raised
in
numerous
angles,
through
numerous
angles.
every
time
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
who,
when
it
heard
that
claim,
rejected
it
saying...
distinguishing
it
indeed
on
its
reading
of
jurek
and
woodson
and
later
on
its
reading
of
lockett.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
your
honor,
let--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--let
me
separate
the
two
concepts
of
futility
because
there
is
a
concept
in
state
law
that
is
quite
well
recognized,
and
it
is
the
concept
that
under
the
state
law
rule,
the
chambers
rule,
where
a
constitutional--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--sure.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
let...
let
me
address
that,
then,
squarely.
it
really
gets
us
to
the
cause
argument,
but
i'm
happy
to
go
there.
our
argument
on
cause
asks
the
court
to
consider
whether
there
is
a
third
kind
of
cause.
not
the
same
as
futility
described
in
engle
v.
isaac,
and
not
the
same
as
novelty
described
in
reed
v.
ross.
there
is
no
question
this
is
not
a
novel
claim.
the
constitutional
principles
were
available.
so
the
question
is
how
is
our
situation
different
from
the
situation
described
in
engle
v.
isaac.
we
submit
it's
different
for
a
number
of
reasons.
in
engle
v.
isaac
the
petitioner
at
trial
did
not
raise
a
claim
because
of
his
view
that
state
law
rulings
based
on
state
law
were
dead
against
it.
indeed,
after
the
state
law
rulings...
the
last
state
law
ruling
on
the
issue...
two
cases
from
this
court
had
been
decided,
the
winship
case
and
mullaney
v.
wilbur,
which
called
into
serious
question
the
continuing
validity
of
the
state
law
ruling.
mr.
isaac
did
not
go
back
to
the
state
courts
and
present
those
new
constitutional
arguments
based
on
cases
from
this
court,
indeed,
based
on
cases
litigating
from
those
principles
in
other
state
and
federal
courts.
he
did
not
go
back
to
the
state
courts.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
just
as
i
haven't.
but
for
quite
a
different
reason.
for
quite
a
different
reason.
and
that
is
how
we
distinguish
ourselves
from
the
kind
of
futility
that
the
court
recognized
in
engle.
what
the
court
recognized
in
engle
is
that
there
is
reason
to
go
back
to
the
state
courts
if
there
is
some
new
light
to
be
shed
on
prior
state
rulings.
certainly
there
was
new
light
in
the
situation
of
mr.
isaac.
there
were
two
decisions
from
this
court
and
there
were
a
number
of
decisions
from
lower
state
courts
and
federal
courts.
in
our
case
there
was
nothing
of
the
sort.
what
happened
by
the
time
of
mr.
selvage's
trial,
which
occurred
in
february
of
1980,
was
that
the...
what
became
the
penry
claim,
the
pre-penry
defect
in
the
statute,
for
lack
of
a
better
term...
had
been
presented
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in...
under
every
conceivable...
on
every
conceivable
basis,
eighth
amendment
basis.
the
argument
had
been
made
that
the
defines...
that
the
terms
of
the
special
issues
were
not
defined
enough
to
allow
consideration
of
mitigation.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
no.
the
argument
was
made
that
mental
illness
which,
as
the
court
recognized,
like
the
mental
retardation
of
henry,
has
an
aggravating
side
and
a
mitigating
side,
only
got
consideration
as
aggravation.
an
argument
was
made,
well,
if...
if
all
the
special
issues
are
answered
yes,
there
still
may
be
mitigating
evidence
that
leads
the
jury
to
think
life
is
the
appropriate
sentence.
and
finally,
the
last
theory
that
was
presented
was,
look,
at
the
very
least
the
jury
ought
to
be
given
a
kind
of
a
soft
nullification
instruction.
they
ought
to
be
told
that
in
answering
the
special
issues
if
you
think
mitigation
should
lead
to
a
life
sentence,
you
can
answer
them
no.
and
on
every...
in
every
one
of
those
decisions
the
court
relied
on
jurek
and
woodson
and
in
the
last...
last
couple
of
decisions,
lockett,
saying,
our
job
here
is
to
guide
discretion.
and
we
let
all
relevant
mitigating
evidence
in,
but
it
has
to
relate
to
these
three
special
issues.
and
if
it
doesn't
relate
to
them,
then
you're
asking
us
to
unguide
discretion.
some
of
the
justices
on
this
court
saw
that
as
the
problem
in
the
penry
case,
and
that
is
the
view
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
had.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
well,
your
honor,
we
were--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--in
this
court
and
had
been
in
this
court
for
15
months
at
that
time.
there...
there
probably
is
no
legal
barrier
to
mr.
selvage
going
back
into
state
court
right
now.
the
constitutional
and
federal
habeas
problem
with
that
is
that
mr....
mr.
selvage
has
had
a
ruling
in
federal
habeas
that
his
claim
cannot
be
reached
on
the
merits.
we
believe,
and
believe
without
any
hesitance,
that
the
state
law
basis
for
that
default
has
now
been
eroded,
that
we
should
be
able
to
gain
relief
on
the
merits
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
justice
white,
you've
described
the
state
law
rule
quite
well.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
courts...
the
texas
courts
have
said
when
a
claim
is
recognized
on
its
constitutional
theories,
presented
to
us,
and
we
reject
it,
you
don't
have
to
keep
raising
it.
if...
if...
in
fact,
you
don't
have
to
object
at
trial
anymore.
if...
if
subsequently
the
supreme
court
say
we
were
wrong,
you
may
come
back
into
state
court.
now,
the
reason
that
presents
a
federal
habeas
procedure
question
is
that
that
very
rule
now
triggered
by
penry
erodes
the
adequacy
of
the
state
law
ruling
in
this
case.
and
so
the
federal
question--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--the
adequacy
question--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--your
honor,
the
state
has
presented
no...
no
argument
that
i've
been
able
to
discern
that
speaks--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--that
is
certainly
a...
well,
i...
i
think
that
the
appropriate
result
here
would
be
to
ask
the
question
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
texas
for
this
reason.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
there...
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
a
certification
procedure
for
this
court
certifying
a
question
to
it.
indeed,
prior
to
the
briefing
in
this
case
we
asked
the
court
do
that,
not
because
we
though
there
was
any
lack
of
clarity
in
state
law,
but
because
we
thought
this
court
might
prefer
to
have
the
state
court
decide
its
procedural
rule
first.
the
court
declined
to
do
that.
but
there
is...
and
it's
discussed
by
both
parties
in
the
motion
for
certification
papers...
there
is
a
procedure
for
certifying
a
question
from
this
court.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
certainly.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
certainly.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
in
the
fifth
circuit?
mr.
richard
h.
burr
that--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--there's
no
question
about
that.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
from
the
perspective
of...
of
judicial
economy
and,
i
believe,
fairness,
the...
the
better
procedure
would
be
if
there
is
any
question
about
state
law,
for
this
court
to
ask
the
state
courts
directly
that
question.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--i
don't
believe
that
the
delay
would
be
very
long
because
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
a
case
before
it
right
now
raising
the
very
same
issue.
the
case
of
harvey
ervin,
ex
parte
ervin.
the
case
has
been
briefed.
it
was
argued
in
mid-september,
and
it
is
awaiting
decision.
i
believe
it
is
awaiting
decision,
awaiting
this
court.
i
believe
that
it
is
a
question
of
after
ualphonse
that...
that
has
developed
by
the
cert.
grant
here.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
so
i
don't
think
it
would
be
much
of
a
delay.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
your
honor,
i...
i
don't
know.
my
guess
is--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--no.
i...
i
don't
know
if
they're
waiting.
they
have
not
decided
the
case.
that's
speculation
on
my
part.
if
they
wait,
it
would
probably
be
a
political
decision
to
wait
and
not
a
legal--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--that
is
certainly
an
option.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
the
thing
that's
important...
i...
i
think
what
you...
what
you've
suggested
does
have
some
crucial
significance.
this
question
ought
to
be
resolved
one
way
or
the
other,
up
or
down,
before
the...
the
questions
of
cause
and
miscarriage
of
justice
should
be
addressed.
because
if
it
is
resolved,
as
we
say
it
should,
then
this
court
need
not
in
this
case
look
at
questions
of
cause
and
miscarriage
of
justice,
because
there
won't
be
a
state
law
ruling
barring
relief
in
federal...
or
barring
a
merits
decision
in
federal
court.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
yes.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
in
order
to
preserve--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--the
client's
right--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--to
relief
later.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
no.
i
think
there's...
there's--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--there's
no
difference
for
this
reason.
if
a
direct
appeal
were...
or
a
cert.
petition...
had
been
taken
from
the
direct
appeal--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--if
penry
had
intervened,
then
we
would
have
been
making
the
same
argument
to
this
court
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
if...
from
this
court's
ruling
as
a
federal
court
imbued
with
the
retroactivity
framework,
it
is
old
law.
but--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--i
don't
think
so
because--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--if...
if
the
issue
had...
there
is
a
question,
i
think,
about
whether
the
issue
had
been
presented
on
the
direct
appeal.
if
the
issue
had
been
presented
in
the
direct
appeals
and
rejected
because
it
had
not
been...
there
had
been
no
objection
at
trial,
then
the
case
would
have
come
here
in
the
very
same
posture
on
the
basis
of
the
state
courts'
resting
their
decision
on
a
state
procedural
rule.
then
the
question
of
the
adequacy
of
the
state
rule
would
have
been
a
question,
a
federal
question,
for
this
court
to
look
at,
just
as
it
is
now.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
if
the
state
court's
reason
for
not
entertaining
it
was
its
state
procedural
rule--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--as
i
believe
we're
both
agreeing
it
would
have
been--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--and
if
under
the
state
procedural
rule
the
penry
decision
had
had
the
effect
we
say...
that
is,
it
had
forgiven
the
default
essentially...
then
this
court
should
be
in
a
position
and
should
decide
that
the
state
ground
of
decision
in
the
state
courts
is
no
longer
adequate,
that
it
has
been
eroded
by
the
very
operation
of
state
law.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
that
is...
that
is
the
argument.
now,
justice
rehnquist...
i'm
sorry...
one...
to...
to
get
back
to
a
question
that
i
think
you
were
asking
as
to
why
we
shouldn't
go
back
to
the
fifth
circuit,
there's
another
reason.
if
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
or
if,
indeed,
the
fifth
circuit,
if
it
were
asked
to
decide
this
question,
said,
no,
that
penry
doesn't
trigger
this
exception
to
the
default
rule
and
we...
and
we
then
have
a
ruling
that
there
is
an
adequate
state
ground
for
the
default,
we
then
would
be
in
a
position
to
get
to
cause
and
miscarriage
of
justice.
this
court
has
already
indicated
by
its--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--well,
no...
not...
i'm
saying
if...
if
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
or
if
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
the
default
has
not
been
forgiven
as
a
result
of
penry
and
we
still
are
in
a
default
posture
and
there's
been
a
definitive
resolution,
that
we
still
are
defaulted
after
penry,
then
the
questions
that
the
court
has
already
said
it
wants
to
address...
that
is,
the
question
of
cause
in
this
context
and
the
question
of
miscarriage
of
justice...
ought
be
addressed.
all
we're
saying
is
that
before
we
get
into
those
thorny
and
difficult
questions,
let's
be
sure
it's
not
an
academic
exercise.
that's
all.
and
we
think
that
the
most
efficient
and
fairest
way
to
do
that
is
either
to
simply
wait
and
let
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
take
its
course
or
to
ask
them
through
the
certification
procedure
how
does
the
ruling
in
penry,
if
at
all,
affect
your
ruling
of
procedural
default
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
if...
if
that
is
so,
then--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--i
think
we
would
be
in
a
position
to
argue
that
it
was
not
consistently
and...
and
appropriately
applied,
as
it
had
been
before.
but
that
is
a
question
that
i
think
should
be
reserved
for
another
day.
if
i
could
just
say
a
couple
of
more
words
about
cause,
then
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
if
we
get
to
the
cause
question
now,
i
think
it
is
terribly
important
for
the
court
to...
to--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
state
procedural
ground
is
an
adequate
one,
and
the
court
appropriately
gets
to
the
question
of
cause
and
miscarriage
of
justice--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--cause
for
the
default.
mr.
richard
h.
burr
a
cause
under
wainwright
v.
sykes.
we
think
the
court
needs
to
take
close...
make
close
scrutiny
of
what
we
say
is
a
third
kind
of
cause.
again,
it's
related
to
the
novelty
cause
exception,
and
it
is
related
to
engle
v.
isaac
futility.
but
it
is
a
distinctly
different
creature.
it
is
a
creature
defined
by
the
very
reasons
that
justice
o'connor
said
in
engle
v.
isaac.
futility,
as
defined
there,
was
a
cause.
and
that
is
there
was
some
reason
to
go
back
to
the
state
courts
with
a
federal
argument.
the
reason
was
because
of
rulings
of
this
court,
rulings
of
other
federal
courts,
rulings
of
other
state
courts
or
other
grounds
of
state
law.
there
was
some
reason
to
go
back
into
state
court
and
to
shine
some
new
light
on
an
old
question
and
ask
the
court
to
reconsider
that
question.
at
the
time
of
trial
of
john
selvage
that
could
not
have
been
done.
that
was
february
of
1980.
at
that
point,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
texas
had
rejected
every
conceivable
constitutional
challenge
to
this
defect
in
the
texas
scheme.
it
had
rejected
it
on
the
basis
of
its
reading
of
this
court's
decisions...
jurek,
woodson,
and
lockett.
there
was
nothing
else
anywhere
else
to
utilize
to
go
back
to
that
court
and
say,
please
look
at
this
again.
there
were
no
other
federal
court
decisions.
there
were
no
decisions
from
other
jurisdictions
because
nobody...
no
other
jurisdiction
had
a
statute
like
texas.
there
was
simply
nothing
counsel
could
do.
counsel
would
be
put
in
the
position...
and
this
is
really
what
the
state's
argument
suggests...
counsel
would
have
been
put
in
the
position
of
going
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
and
saying,
i
want
you
to
reconsider
my
challenge
to
the
preclusion
of
mitigation
consideration
at
trial
because
you're
wrong.
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
say,
well,
we...
we
disagree
with
your
analysis
of
jurek,
woodson
and
lockett
and--
mr.
richard
h.
burr
--thank
you.
