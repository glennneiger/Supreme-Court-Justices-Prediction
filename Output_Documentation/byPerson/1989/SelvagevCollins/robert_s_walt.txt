mr.
robert
s.
walt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
april
1st,
1980,
johnny
paul
penry
presented
mitigating
evidence
he
perceived
had
value
beyond
the
scope
of
texas'
special
issues.
accordingly,
he
objected
to
the
charge
in
compliance
with
state
procedure
and
requested
a
special
instruction
to
allow
the
jury
to
consider
that
mitigating
evidence
beyond
the
scope
of
the
special
issues.
less
than
two
months
earlier
john
selvage
presented
evidence
to
the...
to
his
jury.
mr.
selvage
did
not
request
any
special
instruction.
ten
years
later,
after
direct
appeal,
after
two
rounds
of
state
and
federal
habeas
corpus,
mr.
selvage
now
comes
before
this
court
and
perceives...
perceiving
mitigating
value
beyond
his...
of
his
evidence
beyond
the
special
issues
and
asks
to
be
afforded
the
same
rule
that
was
afforded
johnny
penry.
johnny
penry
complied
with
state
procedure,
preserved
his
error
and
obtained
relief
from
this
court.
john
selvage,
who
had
no
such
respect
for
state
procedure,
should
not
receive
the
same
treatment.
selvage,
though
raising
on
certiorari
a
question
of
whether
his
procedural
default
was...
should
be
excused
for
cause
or
in
fact
even
if
his
procedural
default
is...
there
is
no
cause,
that
the
default
would
result
in
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice.
that's
what
he
raised
on
certiorari.
he
now
comes
before
the
court
and
claims
that
in
fact
he
is
entitled
to
an
additional
claim...
to
review
of
an
additional
claim,
and
that
is
whether
a
procedural
default
exists
at
all.
i
was
listening
to
mr.
burr.
mr.
burr
was
referring
to
the
ex
parte
chambers
case.
there
are
two
matters
which
i
would
like
to
just
briefly
discuss
with
the
court
as...
as
to
chambers.
first,
when
he
applied
for
a
stay
of
execution
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district,
houston
division,
in
his
application
for
a
stay
he
acknowledged
that
the
procedural
bar
was...
was
properly
imposed,
but
he
cited
the
justice
brennan's
dissent
in
the
streetman
v.
lynaugh
case
in
which
justice
brennan
said
franklin
is
pending
before
us,
franklin
if...
if
he
receives
relief,
would
constitute
a
new
rule.
now,
i
submit
to
the
court
that
ex
parte
chambers
existed
prior
to
his
commencement
of
even
state
collateral
review.
and
if
he
perceived
that
what
mr.
franklin
would
receive
would
have
been
a
new
rule,
then
he
was
obligated
at
all
times
to
have
presented
that
claim
both
in...
both
in
the
lower
federal
courts
and,
in
fact,
in
the
state
courts.
he
failed
to--
mr.
robert
s.
walt
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
yes,
your
honor.
ex
parte
chambers
is
a
case...
and
briefly
it
is
discussed
in
both--
mr.
robert
s.
walt
--oh,
boy.
your
honor,
i
believe
it
was
decided
in
1985.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
chambers
stands
for
the
proposition
that
a
novel
claim...
and
state
law
defines
novelty...
will
in
fact
be
excused,
failure
to
object.
and
chambers
relies
on
prior
state
precedent.
so
that
is
not
exclusively
constitutional.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
certainly,
if
it
had
been
raised.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
it
didn't
have
penry,
your
honor,
but
it
did
have...
it
did
have
the
idea
that
franklin
was
pending
before
the
court.
and,
in
fact,
the
court
recognized
that
franklin...
the
reason
it
excused
abuse,
to
be
exact,
is
the
fact
that
they
stated
they
would
be
blind,
that
the
potential
for
a
new
rule
was
present
in...
in...
with
the
franklin
case
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
he
conceded...
the
first
time
on
his
application
for
his
stay
of
execution,
he
stated,
in
fact,
that
the
default
was
properly
imposed,
but
that
it
would
now
be...
it
would
subsequently
be
excused
under
this
court's
novelty...
under
this
court's
novelty
exception
under
reed
v.
ross
because
of...
franklin
would
announce
a
new
rule.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
no,
your
honor.
it
was
with
the
pleading
filed
with
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
texas,
the
district
court
below.
in
ex
parte
chambers
the
court
recognized,
as
i
stated,
a
novelty
exception.
and
that
is
exclusively
a
matter
of
state
law.
i
believe
this
court
has
stated
in
smith
v.
murray
that,
of
course,
the
states
are
always
free
to
rethink
their
positions,
and
we
believe
that
the
proper
consideration
of
this
matter
should
be
to
address
whether
the...
as
this
court
should...
address
rather
whether
the
federal
court
below...
both
the
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals...
properly
applied
federal
law.
not
what...
not
to
speculate
what
state
law
would
be
in
the
future.
mr.
selvage
is
obviously
free
to
go
back
into
state
court
and
obtain
relief
if
in
fact
ex
parte
chambers
is
the
white
horse
case
that
he
claims
it
is.
i
would
also
suggest
that
ex
parte
chambers
is
simply
not
that
type
of
case,
and
there
are
two
reasons.
first
off,
as...
as
mr.
burr
correctly
states,
the
ervin
case...
and
i
believe
there
are
approximately
three
other
cases,
including
walter
bell
which
was
up
before
this
court
in
which
the
state
had
previously
imposed
a
procedural
bar...
those
cases
are
pending
before
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
if
in
fact
penry
dictates
a
new
rule
under
state...
a
novel
rule
under
state
law,
then
of
course
mr.
ervin,
mr.
bell
and
the
others
would
have
already
received
relief.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
possibility.
and
the
reason
i
don't
think
there's
any
possibility,
your
honor,
is
because
we
have
had
two
cases
subsequent
to
penry's
decision,
and
that
would
be
ex
parte
pastor,
ex
parte
billy
joe
woods,
in
which
procedural
bars
were
in
fact
imposed
in
the...
to
back
up.
in
the
state
procedure
the
trial
court
makes
findings
of...
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
and
then
they
would
be
forwarded
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
would
either
reject
or
accept
the
findings,
or
it
can
just
deny
relief
without
accepting
the
findings.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
they
were
both
decisions
of
the
texas
court
of--
mr.
robert
s.
walt
--pardon
me?
since
penry,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
identical,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
harvey
ervin
is
a
different
case.
walter
bell
might
be
on
all
fours.
harvey
ervin
definitely
is
not
on
all
fours
because
ervin
was
tried
prior
to
lockett.
so
lockett
very
well
may
have
been...
may
be
the...
the
cutoff
point
as
far
as...
as
far
as
state
procedure.
xxx
bell
is
the
same
case?
i
believe
walter
bell...
and
i
apologize
to
the
court--
mr.
robert
s.
walt
--it
is
being...
it
is
being
held
essentially
while
the
pending--
mr.
robert
s.
walt
--i...
i
think
mr.
burr
might
have
hit
it
on
the
head,
that
ever
since
penry
where--
mr.
robert
s.
walt
--i
believe
that
there...
i
believe...
i
cannot
speak
for
the
court.
i
would
suggest
some
possibility
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
is...
is,
of
course,
waiting
for
this
court's
pronouncement
as
to
what
constitutes
novelty
or
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
for--
mr.
robert
s.
walt
--it
certainly,
if
the
ex
parte
chambers
were
controlling,
i
think
that
they
would
have
immediately
issued--
mr.
robert
s.
walt
--the
other
two
cases--
mr.
robert
s.
walt
--james
emory
pastor
was
executed
and--
mr.
robert
s.
walt
--james
emory
pastor,
p-a-s-t-o-r.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
procedural
bar
there
were...
it
was
procedural
bar
and
alternatively
on
the
merits
just
as...
as
this
case
was,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
that
was
subsequent
to
penry.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
the
other
was
a
billy
joe
woods.
that
case
has
never
made
it
into
the
federal
system.
i
believe
that
he
has
gone--
mr.
robert
s.
walt
--the
opinions
were
entered
but
they
are
not...
they
are
unpublished
opinions.
that's...
that's
quite
common
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
pastor
is,
although
this
court
probably
has
a
copy
of
the
pastor
opinion
and
the
pastor
findings.
because
of
the
pending
executions
we
do
in
fact
forward
those
to
the
court,
to
your--
mr.
robert
s.
walt
--no.
not
off...
not
off
state
collateral
review,
your
honor.
there
was
a
petition
for
certiorari
in
woods
but
it
was
off
direct
appeal.
it
did
not
raise
this
issue.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
no,
billy
woods
was
not
that
long
before...
well,
it
was
before
penry.
i
don't
know
if
it
was
long--
mr.
robert
s.
walt
--yes.
yes.
but
the
issue
was
not
raised
on
direct
appeal.
focusing--
mr.
robert
s.
walt
--absolutely.
there
is
no...
there
really
is
no
viable
abuse
of
the
writ
posture.
and,
in
fact,
if
there
is
any
abuse
of
the
writ
concept
in
the
texas
courts
in
capital
cases,
it
would
certainly
be
excused
by
the
fact
that...
if
he
is
correct,
that
this
is
a
change
in
the
law,
then
he
would
be
certainly
free
to
go
back
into
state
court.
there
is
no...
there
is
nothing
to
stop
that.
mr.
penry...
oh,
excuse
me,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
selvage
asserts
that
cause
exists
for
his
procedural
default.
as
this
court
noted...
as
some
of
the
questions
that
i've
heard
noted,
lockett
v.
ohio
clearly
predated
mr.
penry...
or,
mr.
selvage's
trial.
this
court's
opinion
in
penry
dictates
the
result
on...
as
far
as
whether
there
is
novelty
for
his
procedural
bar.
clearly,
a
claim
that
is
dictated
by
precedent
that
exists
prior
to
the
trial,
a
person
can
never
claim
novelty
as
an
exception
to
the
procedural
default.
selvage
asserts
that
his
default
involves
a
claim
of
basic
trial
process...
pardon
me.
excuse
me,
i'd
like
to
back
up
for
a
moment.
the
concept
of
futility...
and
this
is
nothing
more
than
futility...
has
been
firmly
established
that
that
cannot
constitute
cause
for
a
procedural
default.
it
was
established
in
engle;
it
was
reaffirmed
in
smith
v.
murray.
it
was...
and
particularly
in
smith
v.
murray.
i
believe
that
that
is
probably
more
on
point
than
would
be
even
engle.
in
smith
v.
murray,
it
was
a
constitutional
claim
that
was
presented
to
the
state
courts.
and
that
was
whether
there
was
a
violation...
or
the
defaulting
claim
was
one
of
whether
there
was
an
estelle
v.
smith
error
for...
in
having
the
psychiatrist
testify
in
violation
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment.
in
that
case,
specifically,
the...
this
court
found
that
that
claim
had
been
percolating
and
that
even
though
the
state
court...
even
though
counsel
could
reasonably
have
concluded
that
the
state
court
would
never
have
granted
him
relief,
the
fact
remains
that
the
tools
were
available
for
him
to
formulate
a
constitutional
challenge.
there
simply
is
no
difference
in
this
case.
in
this
case,
for
instance,
mr.
selvage
suggests
that
the
state
rule
foreclosed
consideration
of
the
claim.
if
one
looks
at
the
existence
of
the
state...
of
the
state
law
at
the
time,
there
could
be
nothing
further
than
the
truth.
the
claim...
most
of
the
cases
that
mr.
selvage
cites
involve
not
as
applied
constitutional
challenge
but,
rather,
facial
challenges.
in
each
of
the
cases,
even
though
they
state
that
mitigating
evidence
couldn't
be
considered,
it
was
in
the
abstract,
stating
that
because
the
concepts
of
deliberate...
the
"deliberately"
was
not
defined,
for
instance;
therefore,
it
was
somehow...
somehow
might
have
allowed
in
the
abstract
the...
that
mitigating
evidence
could
not
be
considered.
in...
in
none
of
those
cases
did...
did
the
petitioner...
or
did
the
appellant
state
that
he
presented
mitigating
evidence
which
could
not
be
considered.
as
i
understand
the
difference
between
"as
applied"
and
"facial
challenges",
is
a
person...
especially
in
the
penry
context,
it
would
be
the
idea
that
i
have
mitigating
evidence;
it
cannot
be
considered.
certainly,
none
of
those
cases
stand
for
that
proposition.
the
one
case
that
does
stand
for
the
proposition
is
quinones
v.
state.
quinones
was
decided
one
month
prior
to
selvage's
trial.
quinones
had
not
sought,
and
this
court
had
not
ruled
on
certiorari
by
the
time
selvage's
trial
resulted.
even
if
the
court
were
to
somehow
adopt
any
concept
of
foreclosure
one
case
subsequent
to
lockett...
and
no
determination
of
certiorari
by
this
court
could
hardly
constitute
foreclosure.
this
court
has...
turning
to
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice...
this
court
has
recognized
that
principles
of
finality
underlying
the
procedural
default
obviously
have
to
give
way
where
such
fundamental
miscarriages
have
resulted.
the
case
of
carrier...
murray
v.
carrier
first
addressed
the
question
of
what
constituted
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice.
in
previous
cases,
both
in
engle...
in
engle
and
in
fact
carrier,
they
rejected
the
concept
that
there
would
be
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice...
this
court
rejected
the
concept
that
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
would
constitute
an
undermining
of
the
fact...
reliability
of
the
fact-finding
process.
it
rejected
the
concept
that
if...
that
the
error
impacted
on
fundamental...
the
fundamental
fairness
of
the
trial.
this
court
stated
that
that
was
nothing
more
than
the...
a
restatement
of
the
prejudice
prong
of
sykes.
the
one
thread
that
runs
through
the...
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
regard
to
the...
in
regard
to
what
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
is,
is
that
whatever
happens,
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
must
be
a
far
narrower
focus
than
whatever
would
constitute
cause
under...
under
wainwright
v.
sykes.
to
have
any...
any
larger
focus
than
that,
or
the
same
focus,
would
in
fact
undermine
the
cause
and
prejudice
standard.
therefore,
this
court
adopted
the
concept
that
there
would
be
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
only
in
the
event
that
a
defendant
could
show
that
the
error
probably
resulted
in
the
conviction
of
a
person
who
was
actually
innocent.
the
court
specifically--
mr.
robert
s.
walt
--absolutely.
mr.
robert
s.
walt
and
this
court
has...
this
court
has,
of
course,
encountered
that
problem,
has
expressed
a...
a...
a
problem
with
it.
how
to...
how
to
translate
actual
innocence
into
the
concept...
into
the
concept
of
capital
sentencing.
the...
the...
this
court
was
undoubtedly...
undoubtedly
aware
of
the
problem
that
resulted
from
the
fact
that
we
have
used
the
concepts
of
guilt
and
innocence
and
translated
it,
which
is
a...
a
question
of
historical
fact...
and
translated
those
into
the
concept
of
a
largely...
of
a
profoundly
moral
question
of
whether
somebody
should...
should
live
or
should
die.
now,
this
court
has,
of
course,
decided
that
certain
classes
of
persons
are
not
eligible
for
a
death
sentence.
persons
who
are
under
the
age
of
16.
persons
who
are...
persons
who
would
fit
within
the
enmund
or
tison
rule.
those
people
are...
and...
and...
those
people
are
not
eligible
for
sentence
and
obviously
a
defendant
who...
those
would
be
historical
facts
that
a
court
could
conclude.
so
if,
of
course,
penry,
alleged
penry
error
resulted
in
the
exclusion
of
evidence
that
would
establish
that,
we
could
of
course
demonstrate
that
a
person
was
actually
innocent
or
the
death
sentence
in
that
regard.
amicus
for
the
state
suggest
that
this
court
should
go
no
further
and
just
avoid
entering
the
subjective
morass
of
morality
which
would
inevitably
result
from
this
court
adopting,
particularly
the
rule
of
that
mr.
selvage
suggests,
any
concept
that
somehow
he
deserves...
that
a
federal
court,
years
after
the
fact,
would
state
that
he
deserves
the
death
penalty,
number
one,
in
my
opinion,
it
would...
would
do
nothing
more
than
restate
what
the
prejudice
prong
of...
of
strickland
v.
washington
is
since
in
effect
of
assistance
of
counsel
is
in
fact
a
standard
for
cause
to
excuse
a
procedural
default.
to
repeat
nothing
more
than
the
prejudice
standard
of
strickland
would
in
fact
negate
in
effect
of
assistance
of
counsel
as
cause
for
a
procedural
default.
since
this
court
obviously
intends...
or,
certainly
appears
to
want
to
have
a
far
narrower
focus
than
that
which
constitutes
cause,
it
necessarily
has
to
be
a
greater...
a
narrower
inquiry
than
whether
a
person
deserves
a
death
sentence.
moreover,
to
say
that
he...
to
have
a
habeas
court
ten...
in
this
case,
ten
years
later,
decide
what...
whether
a
person
deserves
a
death
sentence
is...
is
nothing
more
than
to
ask
for
de
novo
fact-finding
on
a
moral
question
when
the
court
has
neither
heard
the
evidence,
viewed
the
evidence,
viewed
the
demeanor
of
the
witnessed
who
testified;
and,
in
fact,
would
amount
to...
would
amount
to
nothing
more
than
a
habeas
court
imposing
its
moral
judgment
on...
on
fact-finders
who
very
well
may
never
have
possessed
the
identical
moral
judgment.
thus,
the
state
has
suggested
a
standard
which
would...
which
would,
i
think,
narrow
the
discretion...
so
narrow
the
discretion
of
the...
of
the
habeas
court
reviewing
for
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
and
actual
innocence
of
the
death
penalty.
and
that
would
be
to
revise
the
jackson
v.
virginia
standard
so
that...
to
force
the
habeas
court
to
look
through
the
eyes
of
a
rational
juror.
if
the
jury
were
properly
instructed,
if
it
were
presented
with
the
evidence,
would
that
jury...
would
a
jury...
or
could
a
habeas
court
conclude
that
no
rational
juror
would
have
reached
the
same
result,
that
being
a
death
sentence?
we
fell
that
adopting
that
standard,
if
a
standard
is
to
be
adopted
at
all...
and
i'm...
i...
we
agree
entirely
with
amicus
that
we
should
probably
stop
at
the...
whether
they
fit
within
an
excluded
class
of
the
death
penalty...
but
if
this
court
is
to
adopt
a
standard,
it
must
take
pains
to
avoid
the...
the
idea
of
imposing
moral
judgment
years
after
the
fact...
upon...
upon
the
proper...
the
proper
vehicle...
the
proper
fact-finders
which
would
be,
of
course,
the
jury
or
a
judge
in
a--
to
adopt
mr.
selvage's
rule,
the
court
would
do...
pardon
me.
in...
i
would
wish
to
close
at
this
point
and
i
would
ask
the
court
to
recall
that
it
has
taken
great
strides
to
ensure
the
reliability...
or
assure...
ensure
the
preeminence
of
a
trial
and
the
direct
appeal
process.
it's
commenced
with
wainwright
v.
sykes,
it
concluded
at
this
point
in
teague
v.
lane.
to
adopt...
to
adopt
selvage's
proposal
as
to
what
constitutes
cause
would
be
nothing
more
than
to
allow
selvage
to
do
what
penry
could
not
do,
and
that
would
be
a
de
facto
overruling
or
jurek
v.
texas.
to
adopt
his
concept
of
actual
innocence
would
do
nothing
more
than
ask...
than
render
a
trial
as
a
preliminary
hearing,
at
which...
a
preliminary
hearing
to
be
reviewed
years
later
de
novo
by
a
federal
habeas
judge
who
neither
heard
nor
viewed
the
evidence
and
would
be
imposing
his
moral
judgment
upon
the
proper
fact-finders.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we
ask
that
the
matter
be
affirmed
and
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
be
affirmed.
