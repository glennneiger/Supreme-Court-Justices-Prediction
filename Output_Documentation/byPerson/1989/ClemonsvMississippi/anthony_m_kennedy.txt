justice
kennedy
all
right,
then
it
is
all
the
more
plausible
to
read
the
opinion
that
way,
correct?
justice
kennedy
and,
if
the
mississippi
court
does
not
meet
the
chapman
standard,
or
if
we
disagree
with
the
harmless
error
analysis,
then
the
case
has
to
be
reversed,
correct?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
just
conceded
that
a
plausible
way
to
read
the
opinion
is
to
say
there
is
no
reweighing,
that
it
is
just
harmless
error.
and
i
say
if
you
are
wrong
on
harmless
error,
then
it
has
to
be
reversed.
right?
