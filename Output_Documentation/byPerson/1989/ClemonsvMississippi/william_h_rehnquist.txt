chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-6873,
chandler
clemons
v.
mississippi.
mr.
resnick,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
the
court
must
do
more
than
that,
in
order
for...
you
say
they
didn't
really
reweigh.
but
do
you
think
they
should
devote
several
paragraphs
to
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
if
they
say
they
have
the
authority
under
state
law
to
reweigh,
or
they
do
in
fact
reweigh,
that
concludes
that
question,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
the
case
be
different
here,
constitutionally,
in
your
view,
if
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
had
said
in
its
opinion
we
have
the
authority
to
reweigh
these
factors,
and
we
now
reweigh
them
and
find
that
the
result
is
justified?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the...
no
matter,
even
if
they
had
said
what
i
just
said
in
this
opinion,
you
would
say,
citing
the
earlier
opinions
in
which
they
have
said
we
don't
have
authority
to
find
fact,
that
they
were
simply
mistaken
as
to
their
authority
under
state
law
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why...
why
is
that
unconstitutional?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
resnick,
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi,
towards
the
end
of
the
majority
opinion
at
page
49
of
the
joint
appendix,
says
that
mississippi
law
holds
one
invalidating...
one
invalidated
aggravating
circumstance
will
not
suffice
to
overturn
a
death
penalty
where
one
or
more
valid
aggravating
circumstances
remain.
now,
we
have
to
take
that
as
mississippi
law,
do
we
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
under
the
federal
constitution.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
why,
again,
is
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
we
have
certainly
held
in
other
cases,
in
spaziano,
that
the
jury
is
not
a
necessary
part
of
the
sentencing
phase
of
a
death
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
cabana
we
said
an
appellate
court
could
make
findings
in
connection
with
sentencing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
is
that...
why
is
one
type
permissible
and
the
other
not,
under
the
federal
constitution?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
any
court
that
reweighs,
like
the
florida
court,
is
going
to
make
some
sort
of
a
moral
judgment.
that
is
made
by
the
supreme
court
of
florida.
so
long
as
you
allow
reweighing
on
appeal,
the
appellate
court
is
going
to
make
some
sort
of
a
moral
judgment,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
resnick.
mr.
white,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
white.
mr.
resnick,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
one
thing
puzzles
me,
you
say
that
the
mississippi
court
can't
review
facts,
but
on
page
50
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
in
every
capital
case,
i
gather,
complies
with
the
provision
of
the
mississippi
code
that
requires
it
to
make
an
independent
finding
that
the
punishment
of
death
is
not
too
great
when
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
are
weighed
against
each
other,
and
the
death
penalty
will
not
wantonly
or
freakishly
be
imposed.
how
can
they
make
that
finding
without
reviewing
facts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
resnick.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-6873,
clemons
against
mississippi
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
