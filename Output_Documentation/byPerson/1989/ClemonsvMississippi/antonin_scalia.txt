justice
scalia
mr.
resnick,
why
is
that
a
question
of
fact?
i
thought
it
was
a
question
of
community
sense
or
sentiment,
or
something.
but
why
is
whether
the
aggravating
outweighs
the
mitigating,
is
that
a
question
of
fact,
do
you
think
that
that
is
what
the
mississippi
court
was
referring
to
when
it
said
it
can't
determine
facts?
justice
scalia
was
there
a
factual
issue
as
to...
as
to
any
of
the
mitigating
circumstances
or
the
aggravating
circumstances?
justice
scalia
yes.
what,
what
factual
issues
were--
justice
scalia
--you
mean
it
makes
the
findings,
it
doesn't
recite
the
findings.
justice
scalia
can
you
explain
how
they
can
do
that
reweighing
without
having
any
fact-finding
power?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
you
can't
reweigh
unless
you
know
what
mitigating
circumstances
there
are,
and
they
have
no
idea
what
mitigating
circumstances
the
jury
found.
justice
scalia
is
it
clear
that
the
rebalancing
that
the
mississippi
court
made
here
was
a
rebalancing
without
taking
into
account
the
heinous
and
aggravating
circumstances
factor?
justice
scalia
that
is
what
i
find
confusing.
if
they
had
just
said,
you
know,
their
thing
reads
mississippi...
considering
that
mississippi
law
holds
one
invalid
aggravating
circumstance
will
not
suffice
to
overturn
a
death
penalty,
and
that
doesn't
trouble
me,
because
it
won't
suffice;
it
is
not
sufficient
where
one
or
more
remains.
had
it
then
gone
on
to
say
and
considering
that
this,
that
this...
what
was
the
other
aggravating
circumstance,
that
this
was...
killing
occurred
in
the
commission
of
a
robbery
and
was
committed
for
pecuniary
gain--
justice
scalia
--then
i
would
think
they
were
balancing
without
the
heinous
factor.
but
that
is
not
what
they
say.
they
go
on
to
say
and
considering
the
brutal
and
torturous
facts
surrounding
the
murder
of
arthur
shorter.
that
sounds
as
though
they
are
doing
the
balancing
still
taking
into
account
the
heinous
factor.
doesn't
that
trouble
you?
justice
scalia
but
that
is
not
the
one
remaining
aggravating
factor
that
they
are
balancing,
supposedly.
justice
scalia
so
what
relevance--
