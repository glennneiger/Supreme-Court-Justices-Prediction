mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
of
course,
the
issue
is
very
clear
here,
whether
the
mississippi
supreme
court
can
interpret
its
own
laws,
as
i
think
that
this
court
has
said
many
times
that
it
can,
to
allow
it
to
affirm
a
death
case
or
sentence
where
there
is
the
presence
of
one
aggravating
circumstance
that
is
invalid.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that
has
been
most
recently
graphically
pointed
out
in
the
remand
in
johnson
v.
mississippi.
there
they
also
found,
and...
in
the
state
cited
in
my
brief,
they
found
the
other
two
remaining
aggravating
circumstances
were
the
avoidance
of
lawful
arrest
and
heinous,
atrocious
and
cruel.
the
court
looked
at
that
again
and
said
although
there
remains
one
aggravating
circumstance
that
is
not
invalid,
that
of
the
to
avoid
lawful
arrest,
because
of
the
problems
with
heinous,
atrocious
and
cruel,
we
will...
and
then
the
invalidity
of
the
one
that
this
court
set
aside,
the
prior
conviction
that
was
overturned,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
said
we
cannot,
with
the
invalidity
of
two,
with
this
one
remaining,
we
cannot
say
that
it,
what
the
jury
would
have
done
at
that
time.
but
we...
we
reaffirm--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
automatic
rule
in
effect
here.
i
mean,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--no.
i
mean,
i
don't
read
the
opinion
that
way.
i
mean,
it
seems...
i
guess
when
it
says
the
invalidity
of
one
will
not
disturb
a
sentence
of
death,
they
do
look
at
that,
that
aggravating
circumstance
though,
and--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
they
said
it
in
this
particular
opinion.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
that,
with
the
expression
on
page
50
of
the
joint
appendix,
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
saying
that,
using
a
harmless
error
analysis,
really,
we
likewise
are
of
the
opinion
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
jury's
verdict
would
have
been
the
same
without,
with
or
without
the
especially
heinous,
atrocious,
cruel
aggravating
circumstance.
i
think
they
have
applied
a
harmless
error
analysis
to
this
case.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
meeting
the
chapman
standard.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
they
did
not
refer
to
it,
but
i
think--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--just
the
citing,
the
citing
of
chapman?
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
other
than
the
fact
that
they
have
said
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
you
may
come
to
that
conclusion.
i
think
that
is
what
we
have
to
rely
on
that
they
did
so.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
i
think...
i
think
that
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
harmless
error
and
reweighing.
this
court
has
approached
that--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
unless...
unless
there
is
the
reweighing.
i
mean,
that--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
i
would
have
to
agree
with
you
there,
i
guess,
in
that
situation.
if
the
mississippi
supreme
court's
rule
does
not
meet
a
harmless...
the
chapman
standard
there
on
that
point,
i
think
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
relied
on
several
bases
here.
and
the
one
not
granted...
the
cert
was
not
granted
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
they
could
apply
a
limiting
construction
of
heinous,
atrocious
and
cruel
after
the
appellate
stage,
as
is
indicated
in
godfrey,
and
say
this,
the
sentence
here.
as...
and
they
go
through
that
analysis
also
in
this
particular
case.
the...
of
course,
the
cases
that
we
rely
on
are
those
that
are
most
evident,
that
of
zant,
barclay
and
goode--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--i
think
that
they
have,
the
court
has
not
found
the
presence
of
an
invalid,
or
an
aggravating
circumstance
not
supported
by
the
evidence,
prior
to
that
time.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
but
the--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--no,
the...
there
is
a
long
line
of
precedent
in
mississippi
of
the
court
stating
that...
arguendo
saying
that
the
challenge
has
been
made
and
they
say,
they
address
the,
make
the
analysis
of
saying
but
even
if
this
was
invalid--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--yes,
right.
they
have
gone
through
that.
it
only
takes
one
aggravating
circumstance
in
mississippi
to
support
a
death
penalty.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
right.
they
cite
for
all
the
way
back
to
the
beginning,
where
it
was
first
stated,
in
evans
v.
state
in
'82,
where
that
first
came
in,
and
they
were
talking...
in
fact,
the
very
same
aggravating
circumstance
here,
they
said
that
the
challenge
was
made
to
the
heinous,
atrocious
and
cruel
aggravating
circumstance
at
that
point.
and
they
said
that
they
went
through
an
analysis
and
said
that
it
was
all
right,
but
even
if
it
wasn't,
there
is
only
one
aggravating
circumstance--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
they
probably...
the
analysis
that
they
take
there...
i
mean,
they
look
at
it
under
a,
i
think,
a
harmless
error
or
reweighing--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
that
is
similar
to
the
one
in
clausen
on
sentencing,
i
guess,
in
some
regards.
that's...
may
even
be
suggested
by
barclay
and
zant,
both.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that
would
be
correct
there.
of
course,
the
mississippi
statute
differs
from
both
florida
and
georgia
in
the
respect
that
it
is
like
texas
on
the
front
end.
that
there,
you
have
to
commit
a
specific
crime,
one
of
eight
enumerated
crimes,
to
even
be
charged
with
capital
murder
in
mississippi.
it
is
not--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--right.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no,
it
is
not.
barclay
and
goode
were
both--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--weighing
states...
in
florida,
where
it
was
a
weighing
state.
and
mississippi,
the
instructions
here,
and
also
they
have...
in
addition,
the
jury,
much
like
the
argument
previous
to
this,
the
jury
has
to
go
additionally--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--that
seems
to
be
right,
the
way
i
read
zant,
that
the
court
can
look
at
that
again--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
and
i
think
that
the...
and
the
decisions
of
this
court
since
that
time
have
tended
to
obliterate
the
distinction,
especially
the
opinion
in
franklin,
between
weighing
and
non-weighing
states
there,
in
that
regard.
franklin
has
talked
about
that
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
difference.
even
in
georgia,
where
the
aggravating
circumstance
takes
you
across
that
threshold,
and
then
they
can
consider
everything
that
they,
that
can
be
put
in
in
georgia,
there
is,
the
jury
does
something
with
all
of
that.
at
that
point
it
is
a
weighing
process
there
with
the
jury,
at
that
point.
and
in
any
harmless
error
analysis,
i
think,
there
is
an
amount
of
weighing
by
the
appellate
court
when
the
harmless
error
analysis
is
used.
in
addition
to
the
weighing
process
in
mississippi,
of
course,
there
is
always,
as
the
instruction
in
this
case,
the
jury
then
has
to
make
a
determination
that
the
death
penalty
is
appropriate
in
this
case.
this,
of
course...
the
evidence
underlying
this
aggravating
circumstance
that
is
vague
because
of
the
instruction,
was
certainly
admissible
in
all
respects.
so
we
have
a
similar
situation
that
we
have
in
barclay,
zant
and
goode,
where
the
evidence
that
went
to
the
jury
was
certainly
admissible
for
all
respects
before
the
jury.
it
is
just
how
the
jury
was
to
apply
that
that
we
have
problems
with
here.
the
fifth
circuit,
as
justice
white
mentioned
a
while
ago,
the
fifth
circuit
has
approved
this
in
several
cases.
in
fact,
in
one
case,
instead
of...
it
went
ahead
and
made
the
analysis
of
itself,
and
held
that
this
aggravating
circumstance
did
not...
the
invalidity
of
this
aggravating
circumstance
did
not
require
reversal
of
the
case,
and
affirmed,
and
that
was
in
stringer
v.
jackson,
and
affirmed
a
death
penalty
sentence
there
on
the
federal
level.
so,
the
fifth
circuit
has
recognized
mississippi
law
and
upheld
it
in
several
situations,
edwards
v.
skargy,
and
in
the
latest,
of
course,
is
stringer
v.
jackson.
the
other
circuits
that
have
looked
at
this,
the
eighth
and
the
tenth
and
the
eleventh,
have
all
agreed.
the
ninth
circuit
for
a
while
had
agreed,
and
i
think
with
the
ruling
in
adamson
v.
ricketts
they
have,
the
en
banc
ruling,
has
changed
that.
the
new
shafer
ruling
had
been
before
that,
and
had
adopted
a,
this,
the
zant
type
analysis.
the...
of
course
the
court
has
said,
in
satterwhite,
that
the...
that
it
held
that
a
state
supreme
court
can,
or
appellate
court
can
apply
harmless
error
analysis
to
capital
sentencing
errors.
and
of
course,
this
culminates
in
a
line
of
adamson...
adams,
franklin
and
penry,
that
there
is
not
really
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
weighing
states
and
non-weighing
states.
so
we
contend
that
the
satterwhite
harmless
error
analysis
should
apply
in
this
case.
the
invitation
was
there
in
maynard,
in
the
concluding
paragraphs
of
maynard,
the...
this
court
invited
the
courts
to
reconsider,
and
it
said
that
it
was
for
the
states
to
determine
what
effect
an
invalid
aggravating
circumstance
would
have
on
a
death
sentence.
they...
the
point
being
in
there,
in
maynard,
was
that
the
federal
appellate
court
was
not
to
do
what
the
state
supreme
court
would
not
do
at
that
time.
of
course,
the
arizona
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
changed
its
standpoint
at
that
time,
and
now
follows
much
the
same
as
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
by
affirming
if
there
are
invalid
aggravating
circumstances,
after
a
reconsideration.
the
mississippi
statute,
of
course,
does
require
jury
sentencing
at
the
initial
situation.
but
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
interpreted
that
it
can
review
and
affirm
a
death
penalty
case
even
though
there
is
an
invalid
circumstance.
and
we
would
submit
that
that
is...
is
a
matter
of
state
law,
an
interpretation
of
state
law
in
that
regard.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
dispute
the
fact
that--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
i...
the
first
respect
of
that,
i
would
dispute
the
fact
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
ever
said
that
it
cannot.
it
says
that
it
is
a
difficult
task,
but
it
has
never
said
that
it
cannot
find
facts,
because
it
does
find
facts
and
substitutes
its
own
factual
finding
sometimes
for
lower
court
factual
findings,
occasionally.
here,
i
think
they
look
at
the
record.
they
take
the
totality
of
it,
and
i
think
they
say,
as
a
given,
say
that
they
found
all
of
these
mitigating
factors,
and
they
look
at
it
again
and
consider
the
situation,
and
then
do
a...
their
analysis
that
way.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no,
they
could
not
have
imposed
a
sentence
themselves.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
it
is,
but
that's...
the
sentence
has
already
imposed.
they
are
only
correcting
any
errors
in
that
sentence
at
that
point,
if
that's--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
maybe
it
is
a
combination
of
all
of
it.
i
think
they
look
at
it
as
a
reweighing
and
a
harmless
error
situation
there,
both,
if
they
are
at
all
separate
in
the
long
run
there.
but,
as
long
as
the
information
that
goes
to
the
jury,
in
the
concurrence
in
barclay,
as
long
as
the
federal
constitution
does
not
bar
introduction
of
the
evidence
underlying
those
aggravating
factors,
it
does
not
require
the
death
penalty
be
set
aside.
there...
the
existence
or
non-existence
of
mitigating
factors
is
one
of
those
things
that
the
court
considered
in
affirming
in
barclay,
and
the
balance
struck...
i
mean,
can
the
court
look
at
that
and
balance
those
issues
again.
and
the
court,
i
think,
clearly
said
that
in...
in
barclay
and
goode
both,
that
they
could
do
that,
that
the
state
courts
could
do
that.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
don't
know
that
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
they
did
that,
since
they
did
say
that,
as
an
alternative
ground,
that
they
were
applying
it,
their
own
limiting
construction
in
finding
this...
the...
that
this
was
a
properly
submitted
thing
also--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--right.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
i
think...
i
think
that
those
are,
maybe
a
separate
analysis.
because
that
is...
that
is
clearly
properly
before
the
jury.
that
was
admitted
during
the
brutal
facts
of
the
crime,
or
admitted
during
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no.
i
agree.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
of
course,
then
they
go
on,
on
the
next
page,
talking
about
the,
it
is
not
too
great
when
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
are
weighed
against
each
other,
and
the
death
penalty
will
not
be
wantonly
or
freakishly
imposed.
that's
that...
the
additional
ground
in
both
zant
and
barclay
that
the
court
has
relied
on,
not
just
the
fact
that
the
issue,
or
the
evidence
that
went
to
the
jury
was
not
inadmissible.
the
other
is
the
mandatory
appellate
review
that
is
performed
by
the
states,
and
i
think
that's...
for
the
wantonness
and
freakishness
in
proportionality,
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
does
perform.
and,
as
i
think
we
go
on
to
say,
that
the...
in
this
case,
contrary
to
petitioner's
view,
heinous,
atrocious
and
cruel
is
not
per
se
unconstitutional,
as
long
as
it
is
approached
with
the
proper
instructing
devices.
and
we
do
contend
that
the
limiting
construction
was
applied
in
this
case.
thank
you.
