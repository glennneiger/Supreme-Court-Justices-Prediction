justice
stevens
may...
before
you
get
on,
may
i...
may
i
ask
you
one
question.
the
critical
paragraph
on
page
49
does
seem
to
list
a
number
of
different
grounds
for
the
decision,
that
they
have
placed
a
limiting
construction
on
their...
their
the
[inaudible]
circumstance.
and
then
the
second
one,
the
chief
justice
referred
to
this
earlier,
that
mississippi
law
holds
one
invalid
aggravating
circumstance
will
not
suffice
to
overturn
a
death
penalty
where
one
or
more
valid
aggravating
circumstances
remains.
now,
you
say
that
is
inconsistent
with
johnson,
which
it
clearly
is.
but
is
it,
is
there
any
case
prior
to
johnson,
which
is
later
than
this
one,
where
they
failed
to
follow
that
rule?
i
would
have
read
that
as
kind
of
a
rule
of
law.
in
mississippi,
if
you've
got
one
aggravating
circumstance,
we'll
affirm.
was
there
law,
up
to
johnson,
consistent
with
that
interpretation?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
then
why
would
they...
well
then,
why
would
they
have
said
this
if
there's
no
precedent
for
this
statement.
they
just
pulled
it
out
of
the
air
then,
i
guess?
justice
stevens
i
see.
as
long
as
there
is
one
valid
sort
of--
justice
stevens
--i
see.
mr.
white,
on
page
45,
earlier
in
the
opinion,
it
looks
to
me,
there,
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
says
the
same
thing
that
we
are
talking
about
and
there
they
do
seem
to
cite
a
number
of
mississippi
cases
for
the
proposition.
justice
stevens
may
i
then
follow
up
with
this
question
if
we
put
johnson
to
one
side,
because
i
agree
with
you,
that
seems
to
be
inconsistent...
and
assume
this
was
the
sole
ground
of
decision
for
just
a
moment,
that
is
not
true,
there
are
multiple
grounds,
but
if
they
had
relied
on
that
ground
alone,
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
constitutionally
tenable
position
for
the
state
court
to
take?
that
regardless
of
what
else
is
involved
in
the
case,
as
long
as
there
is
one
aggravating
circumstance
properly
found
in
the
record,
we
will
uphold
the
death
penalty.
justice
stevens
but
they
have
kind
of
a
per
se
harmless
error
analysis
is
what
it
amounts
to.
justice
stevens
yeah.
mississippi's...
under
the
statute,
mississippi
is
a
weighing
state.
you
weigh
aggravating
against
mitigating.
justice
stevens
if
they
reweigh,
isn't
that
the
function
you
perform
when
you
are
doing
the
sentencing?
and
i
think
you
say
in
your
own
brief,
they
could
not
impose
a
sentence
themselves.
justice
stevens
and
isn't
the
reweighing
necessarily
a
part
of
the
process
of
sentencing?
justice
stevens
i
can
understand
your
saying
that
it
is
harmless
error,
after
they
study
it
all
the
way
through,
but
i
really
am
a
little,
little
uncertain...
i
am
not
sure
i
exactly
capture
your
position
on
what
the
reweighing
process
is.
it
isn't
a
way
of
finding
that
there
was
no
error,
because
they
only
do
it
after
they
decide
there
was
some
error.
justice
stevens
and
it
isn't
a
sentencing
itself,
because
they
have
no
power
to
do
that.
and
it
isn't
a
finding
of
harmless
error.
so
i
am
really
not
quite
sure
what
it
is.
