mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
appeal,
petitioner
contends
that
the
decision
of
the
miss...
the
mississippi
supreme
court's
decision
to
save
petitioner's
sentence
of
death
from
constitutional
error
violates
his
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
have
a
jury
weigh
and
balance
permissible
aggravating
circumstances
against
the
mitigating
circumstances,
as
required
by
state
law,
and
violates
his
eighth
amendment
right
to
have
the
lawful
sentencing
authority
consider
and
give
effect
to
his
evidence
in
mitigation.
mr.
clemons
was
convicted
of
capital
murder
for
his
involvement
with
two
others
in
a
felony
murder
in
mississippi.
following
the
conviction,
the
court
held
a
sentencing
hearing,
and
at
this
hearing
mr.
clemons
offered
substantial
evidence
in
mitigation
that
was
sufficient
to
support
findings
of
a
number
of
statutory
and
non-statutory
mitigating
circumstances
under
mississippi
law.
these
mitigating
circumstances
included
the
youth
of
the
defendant...
mr.
clemons
had
just
turned
18
at
the
time
of
the
offense;
his
expression
of
remorse
at
trial;
his
substance
abuse,
both
chronic
and
at
the
time
of
the
crime;
organic
brain
damage
sufficient
to
impair
his
judgment;
his
chances
of
benefitting
from
a
rehabilitation
program
while
incarcerated,
and
his
lack
of
any
prior
criminal
history.
the
prosecution
did
not
offer
any
additional
evidence
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
choosing
instead
to
argue
the
evidence
that
was
presented
at
the
guilt
trial
in
support
of
the
two
aggravating
circumstances
that
were
submitted
to
the
jury
by
the
court.
those
two
aggravating
circumstances
were
the
robbery
and
the
especially
heinous,
atrocious
or
cruel
aggravating
circumstance.
the
trial
court
did
not
provide
the
jury,
in
giving
the
instructions,
any
limiting
construction
of
the
especially
heinous
aggravating
circumstance.
no
definition
whatsoever
of
those
terms
were
given
to
the
jury
as
they
considered
the
capital
sentencing
determination
in
this
case.
in
closing
argument,
the
prosecution
focused
virtually
exclusively
on
the
especially
heinous
aggravating
circumstance
in
urging
the
jury
to
impose
a
death
penalty.
after
deliberating
overnight,
the
jury
in
fact
returned
a
verdict
of
death,
and
in
particular
the
jury
specifically
rejected
the
prosecution's
trial
theory
that
mr.
clemons
actually
killed,
or
even
intended
to
kill,
the
victim.
the
jury
expressly
found
that
mr.
clemons
contemplated
lethal
force.
the
jury
found
both
aggravating
circumstances
to
exist,
and
found
that
the
mitigating
circumstances
were
insufficient
to
outweigh
the
two
aggravating
circumstances.
while
mr.
clemons'
appeal
was
appending
to
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
this
court
decided
maynard
v.
cartwright.
in
light
of
this
development,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
requested
supplemental
briefs
on
the
issue
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
especially
heinous
aggravating
circumstance
in
mississippi.
the
bottom
line
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court's
opinion
in
this
case
is
that
the
invalidity
of
an
aggravating
circumstance
will
not
suffice
to
overturn
a
sentence
of
death,
as
long
as
a
single
valid
aggravating
circumstance
remains.
the
state
contends
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
could
employ
two
methods,
two
alternative
methods,
to
reach
this
result.
first,
the
state
contends,
or
claims,
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
may
independently
reweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances
against
the
mitigating
circumstances
in
an
effort
to
cure
the
constitutional
error
in
this
case.
second,
the
state
has
also
contended
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
may
apply
a
zant
v.
stephens
analysis
to
the
facts
of
this
case
to
show
that
the
jury's
consideration
of
the
especially
heinous
aggravating
circumstance
was
harmless.
it
is
petitioner's
contention
that
neither
alternative
is
constitutionally
sufficient
to
save
the
penalty
of
death
in
this
case.
first,
there
is
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
actually
reweighed
in
a
meaningful
fashion
the
one
remaining
aggravating
circumstance,
that
is
the
robbery,
against
the
mitigating
circumstances
to
eliminate
the
constitutional
error
in
this
case.
the
only
hint,
the
only
hint
of
reweighing
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
comes
in
the
proportionality
review
section
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court's
opinion
below,
that
is
at
the
joint
appendix
page
50.
in
that
section,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
wrote,
in
our
opinion,
after
a
review
of
those
cases
coming
before
this
court
and
comparing
them
to
the
present
case,
the
punishment
of
death
is
not
too
great,
when
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
are
weighed
against
each
other,
and
the
penalty
will
not
be
wantonly
or
freakishly
imposed
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
your
honor,
it's
petitioner's
contention
in
this
case
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
does
not
have
the
authority
under
state
law
to
reweigh,
and--
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
--your
honor,
the
only
reweighing,
it
is
petitioner's...
the
reweighing
that
was
spoken
of
in
the
proportionality
review
section
of
the
opinion
speaks
only
to
proportionality.
in
other
words,
when
the
circumstances,
or
the
balance
struck
in
this
particular
case
was
compared
to
the
balance
struck
in
other
cases
in
mississippi,
the
court
found
that
this
case
was
not
disproportionate.
what
i
am
suggesting,
what
petitioner
is
suggesting,
is
that
the
court
cannot
eliminate
the
constitutional
error
in
this
case,
and
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
never
said
that
it
has
the
ability
to
reweigh.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
text
of
the
opinion,
the
court
specifically
stated,
when
reviewing
the
sufficiency
of
the
jury's
finding
in
aggravation
and
the
balance
that
was
struck,
that
they
are
bound
by
the
jury's
determination.
that
appears
in
the
opinion.
they
are
bound
by
the
factual
findings
of
the
jury,
suggesting
that
you
do...
they
do
not
undertake
a
reweighing,
an
independent
reweighing
of
the
evidence,
as,
for
example,
this
court
noticed
in
barclay
and
in
goode.
the
florida
courts
have
a
different
procedure.
under
those
procedure...
under
florida
procedure,
the
trial
court,
the
sentencing
authority,
makes
findings
of
fact,
both
in
aggravation
and
in
mitigation,
and
justifies
those
findings
of
fact
by
their
review
of
the
record.
and
then
the
case
goes
up
on
appeal.
in
this
case,
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
when
it
receives
the
case
on
appeal,
does
not
have
any
findings
of
fact
on
the
issue
of
mitigation.
the
only
findings
of
fact
are
made
in
aggravation
in
mississippi.
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
no,
your
honor.
the
reason
being
is
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
time
and
time
and
time
again
said
specifically
that
it
will
not
find
facts.
it
may
have
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
--i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
they
were
mistaken
as
to
their
authority
under
state
law
in
connection
with
their
ability
to
look
at
the
balance
struck
in
this
case
and
compare
it
as
part
of
a
proportionality
review
with
other
cases.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
and
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
said,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
that
they
cannot
find
facts.
in
other--
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
--what
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
referred
to
in
this
case
and
other
cases,
is
that
it
will
not
find
facts
on
appeals.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
said
that
they
lack
the
practical
ability
to
find
fact,
and
that
chances
of
error
of
any
factual
finding--
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
--in
this
case?
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
well,
for
example,
mr.
clemons
testified
in
his
own
defense
at
this
case,
and
part
of
his
testimony
was
offered
in
mitigation,
his
expression
of
remorse,
his
background.
the
jury,
which
is
the
only
lawful
sentencing
authority
in
mississippi,
could
accept
or
completely
reject
that
testimony
on
the
basis
of
its
credibility.
it
could
assign
a
relative
weight
to
it.
there
were
a
number
of
factual
issues.
a
psychologist
testified
as
to
mr.
chandler's...
chandler
clemons'
background.
once
again,
the
jury
could
accept
or
reject
all
of
that
testimony.
so
that
when
the
jury
makes
its
decision,
the
decision-making
process
in
mississippi,
it
makes
certain
specific
findings
in
aggravation,
it
makes
findings
in
mitigation,
and
then,
according
to
the
instructions
in
this
case,
weighs
the
two.
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
it
doesn't...
i
am
sorry.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
problem
is
that
there
are
no
express
written
findings
in
mitigation.
those
are
subsumed
within
the
weighing
process.
and
there
is
evidence
in
this
case
from
which
the
jury
could
find
mitigating
circumstances,
because
evidence
was
presented
sufficient
to
give
the
jury
the
ability
to
weigh
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
what
the...
excuse
me,
your
honor.
what
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
is
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
after
reading
maynard,
the
court
there
distinguished
maynard
on
the
basis
that
in--
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
--what
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
is
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
from
time
to
time,
in
dicta...
it
was
never
the
holding
of
the
court,
because
they
had
always
found
that
the
specially
heinous
aggravating
circumstance
was
found...
in
dicta
has
said
where
one
aggravating
circumstance,
or
more
aggravating
circumstances,
is
invalid,
either
under
state
law
or
under
the
federal
constitution,
a
remaining
valid
aggravating
circumstance
will
be
sufficient
to
uphold
the
death
penalties.
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
that
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
said,
and
it
is
petitioner's
contention...
i
am
sorry;
excuse
me.
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
it's
petitioner's
contention
that
when
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
applied
this
rule,
in
other
words,
where
one
aggravating
circumstance
does
not
outweigh...
or,
excuse
me,
where
one
aggravating
circumstance,
or
insufficient
or
invalid
aggravating
circumstance,
will
not
outweigh...
i
am
sorry,
will
not
invalidate
the
death
sentence,
it's
petitioner's
contention
that
this
is
being
applied
in
a
mechanical
fashion.
it
is
an
automatic
rule
of
affirmance.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
the
mississippi...
and
in
the
other
cases
cited
by
the
fifth
circuit,
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
not
made
any
particularized
analysis
of
prejudicial
effect
on
the
jury,
or
any
effect
on
the
jury.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
said
that
it
will
affirm
the
death
penalty
where
there
are
sufficient
aggravating
circumstances
remaining.
the
problem
here--
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
--the
problem
is...
is
that...
the
constitutional
problem
here
is
that,
in
this
case,
and
under
the
mississippi
statutory
scheme,
aggravating
circumstances
play
a
very
important
role
in
guiding
the
discretion
of
the
jury.
unlike
the
georgia
scheme,
which
was
before
this
court
in
zant,
the
aggravating
circumstances,
in
this
case
the
jury
was
instructed
to
consider
two,
the
label
of
aggravating
circumstance
sticks
with
the
jury
throughout
their
consideration.
in
this
case
they
considered
one
aggravating
circumstance,
in
exact
language
of
the
especially
heinous
circumstance
in
oklahoma,
that
this
court
has
already
declared
unconstitutional.
one
of
the
two
factors
upon
which
the
jury
could
predicate
a
death
sentence,
has
been
declared
unconstitutional,
because
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
arbitrariness
under
the
eighth
amendment.
in
this
case
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
the
jury
relied
upon
this
aggravating
circumstance
in
coming
to
its
conclusion
that
death
is
the
punishment
that
should
be
imposed
in
this
case.
the
prosecution
obviously
thought
that
this
was
its
strong
point.
it
argued
the
especially
heinous
aggravating
circumstance
virtually
to
the
exclusion
of
the
robbery
circumstance,
in
urging
the
jury
to
come
to
a
death
sentence.
moreover,
in
arguing
the
especially
heinous
aggravating
circumstance,
the
prosecution
used
the
broad,
and
exploited
the
broad
nature
of
the
especially
heinous
aggravating
circumstance
as
a
vehicle
to
put
before
the
jury
evidence
of
personal
sympathetic
characteristics
of
the
victim.
the
prosecution
argued,
as
a
reason
to
impose
the
death
penalty
under
the
especially
heinous
rubric,
the
fact
that
the
victim
was
an
honest
person,
that
he
was
law
abiding,
he
was
a
good
person,
worked
hard,
educated.
indeed,
the
prosecution
stated
that
this
victim
would
have
done
more,
and
would
have
accomplished
a
lot
more
in
life,
if
it
were
not
for
the
senseless,
heinous,
atrocious
and
cruel
murder.
this
is
precisely
the
reason
why
an
automatic
rule
of
affirmance,
without
any
particularized
analysis
as
to
prejudicial
effect,
is
unconstitutional.
it
does
not
say--
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
--the
federal
harmless
error
analysis?
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
the
court
did
state
in
its
opinion
that
it
found
that
the
same
result
would
occur
had
the
jury
not
considered
the
especially
heinous
aggravating
circumstance,
and
they
found
that
beyond
reasonable
doubt.
so
the
answer
to
the
question
is
yes.
however,
what
we
are
asking
this
court
to
do,
since
this
is
a
federal
question
with
constitutional
error
here,
is
to
reexamine
that
conclusion.
if
one
looks
at
the
circumstances
presented
in
this
case
and
compares
them
to
those
in
johnson,
in
johnson
v.
mississippi,
decided
last
term,
in
chapman,
in
satterwhite,
and
the
factors
that
this
court
relied
on,
in
particular
in
satterwhite,
to
determine
whether
or
not
something
was
harmless
error
under
a
federal
standard,
we
have
the
same
type
of
factors
present.
in
this
case,
as
in
chapman,
satterwhite
and
johnson,
the
especially
heinous
aggravating
circumstance
was
argued;
it
became
the
centerpiece
of
the
prosecution's
argument
to
the
jury.
the
especially
heinous
aggravating
circumstance
was
the
vehicle
for
introducing
the
victim
evidence.
the...
this
is
a
case,
this
is
not
a
case
such
as
those
in
florida
where
there
is
zero
mitigation
or
no
mitigation.
there
is
substantial
mitigation
in
this
case.
the
defendant's
youth,
his
expression
of
remorse,
the
brain
damage.
and
moreover,
the
fact
that
the
jury
found
that
he
was
not
the
actual
killer.
the
jury
rejected
that
proposition,
even
though
that
was
the
premise
of
the
prosecution's
trial
theory.
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
that's
correct,
as
long
as
that
harmless
error
analysis
was
consistent
with
this
court's
expression
of
that
standard
in
the
cases
such
as
satterwhite
and
johnson
and
chapman,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
--your
honor,
i
can't
come
to
that
conclusion
for
one
particular
reason.
it's
that
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
--your
honor,
the
problem
with
reweighing,
the
constitutional
problem
with
reweighing,
is
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
already
professed
the
fact
that
it
is
practically
incapable
of
finding
fact.
and...
let
me...
let
me
start
over
by
saying
what
is
involved
in
the
decision
to
impose
death
in
mississippi.
as
i
stated
earlier,
aggravating
circumstances
must
be
found.
mitigating
circumstances,
to
the
extent
evidence
was
submitted,
must
be
found.
a
decision
must
be
made
by
the
sentencing
authority
as
to
the
relative
weights
for
both
the
aggravating
and
the
mitigating
circumstances,
and
they
must
be
weighed.
the
sentencing
authority,
which
is
the
jury
in
mississippi,
must
be
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
unanimously
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
do
indeed
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances.
the
problem--
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
--that
is
precisely
what
the
mississippi
supreme
court
is
expressing,
and
it
is
petitioner's
contention
that
that
construction
of
its
own
law
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
correct.
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
mr.
clemons
is
asserting
before
this
court
a
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
have
the
jury
make
the
particular
findings
that
death
is
the
appropriate
punishment
in
this
case.
if--
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
--in...
that's
correct.
in
spaziano
this
court
did
hold
there
is
no
constitutional
right
to
have
a
jury
just
make
that
question.
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
it
must
be
somebody
at
the
trial
level.
spaziano
does
not
say
that
an
appellate
court
may
make
the
particular
findings
that
death
is
an

of

that

mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
because
in
this
case
what
we
are
asking
the
sentencing
authority
to
do
is
to
make
a
moral
judgment
and
factual
finding
with
respect
to
multiple
issues,
with
respect
to
multiple
issues
in
aggravation.
the...
excuse
me,
in
mitigation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
that's
correct,
as
long
as
it
is
a
well-informed
judgment.
for
example,
the
courts
in
florida
may
reweigh
because
they
have
findings
in
mitigation
and
aggravation,
and
the
trial
court's
justification
for
making
those
factual
findings.
and,
as
the
court
expressed
in
its
per
curiam
opinion
in
goode,
and
in
the
[inaudible]
opinion
in
barclay,
there
was
nothing
wrong
with
the
florida
supreme
court
reweighing
the
findings
the
aggravation
and
the
findings
in
mitigation.
in
this
particular
case
we
have
no
findings
in
mitigation
for
the
mississippi
supreme
court
to
reweigh.
that
court
itself
has
professed
an
inability
to
make
factual
determinations.
it
has
said
itself
that
any
factual
findings
they
may
make,
the
chances
of
error
are
infinitely
greater
than
had
those
same
factual
findings
been
made
by
a
jury
that
had
heard
the
evidence
and
seen
the
argument.
in
addition,
this
court
also
stated
in
caldwell,
in
the
opinion
in
caldwell,
that
the
consideration,
when
this
court
enunciated
the
right,
or
developed
the
right
of
a
defendant
to
have
mitigating
evidence
considered,
it
was
contemplated
that
that
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence
would
occur
among
those
who
were
before
the
court,
who
saw
the
witnesses
testify,
heard
the
evidence
and
heard
the
arguments
of
counsel.
that
would
not
be
the
case
if
the
mississippi
supreme
court
were
independently
to
make
its
own
factual
findings
in
mitigation,
assess
relative
weights
to
the
aggravating
and
the
mitigating
and
then
reweigh
themselves.
they
don't
have
the
practical
ability
to
do
that,
and
they
have
professed
that
themselves
on
a
number
of
occasions.
the
essence
of
petitioner's
argument
is
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
cannot
apply
an
automatic
rule
of
affirmance
to
federal
constitutional
error.
that
is,
federal
constitutional
error
is,
of
course,
a
federal
question,
and
that
this
court
has
the
power
and
jurisdiction
to
review
mississippi's
determination
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
any
prejudicial
effect
upon
the
jury.
even
in
zant
v.
stephens,
this
court
did
not
end
its
analysis
with
the
discussion
of
the
structure
of
the
georgia
sentencing
scheme.
it
went
on
to
determine
whether
the
error
in
that
case,
and
once
again
it
was
a
vague
invalid
aggravating
circumstance,
whether
the...
that
vague
aggravating
circumstance
may
have
had
an
effect
upon
the
jury.
there,
the
evidence
was
properly
before
the
jury,
the
evidence
of
the
prior
conviction
was
before
the
jury.
so
zant
v.
stephens
doesn't
compel
a
rule
of
automatic
affirmance.
the
court
still
looked
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
unconstitutional
factor
had
an
effect
upon
the
jury.
and
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
not
done
that
in
this
case.
it
should
not
be
forgotten
that
the
function
of
an
aggravating
circumstance
in
mississippi
sticks
with
the
jury
throughout
their
deliberation
process.
that,
in
contrast
to
cases
such
as
zant,
that
aggravating
circumstances,
and
the
instructions
in
this
case,
placed
a
particular
emphasis
on
the
role
of
the
aggravating
circumstances
in
the
jury's
ultimate
decision.
the...
so
that,
in
this
case,
the
aggravating
circumstance
channel
and
guide
the
jury's
discretion
in
coming
to
their
conclusion.
and
in
this
case
federal
constitutional
error
tainted
that
process
and
left
the
balance
unskewed.
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
s.
resnick
your
honor,
there
is
a
history
to
that,
that
provision,
because
that
question
occurred
to
me.
this
language,
in
the
further
review
opinion,
predates
the
1977
statute
in
mississippi.
before
1977,
there
was
a...
and
let
me
back
track.
prior
to
1977,
there
was
a
statute
in
mississippi
that
required
a
mandatory
death
sentence.
in
jackson
v.
state,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
construed
their
statute
so
as
to
make
it
constitutional.
and
based
upon
this
court's
opinion
in
gregg
and
in
proffitt,
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
in
the
absence
of
any
specific
statutory
prohibition,
gave
themselves
the
authority,
construed
their
statute
to
give
them
the
authority,
that
existing
statute
to
give
them
the
authority
that
they
could
undertake
this
type
of
analysis.
since
1977,
when
the...
when
the
mississippi
legislature
and
the
people
of
mississippi
committed
the
death
sentence
determination
to
the
jury,
this
language
has
appeared
almost
as
if
in
boilerplate
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court's
opinions
from
time
to
time.
but
the
history
of
it
dates
back
to
a
time
when
the
mississippi
supreme
court
did
not
have,
there
was
no
statutory
prohibition
against
it,
undertaking
some
sort
of
proportionality
reweighing
to
compare
the
balance
in
this
case
against
the
other
cases
that
come
before
it.
but
that
doesn't...
that
does
not
cure
the
constitutional
error.
the
state
has
conceded
that
the
weighing
here,
and
of
course
this
is
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
in
the
plural,
that
if
indeed
there
was
a
reweighing
here,
what
the
court
did
was
include
the
very
unconstitutional
factor
that
it
was
trying
to
cure.
that's
no
cure
at
all.
in
barclay
v.
florida,
one
of
the
principles
that
this
court
relied
upon
in
affirming
the
death
sentence,
was
that
the
florida
supreme
court
does
not
apply
its
harmless
error
analysis
in
an
automatic
or
mechanical
fashion,
but
rather
upholds
death
sentences
on
the
basis
of
this
analysis
only
when
it
actually
finds
that
the
error
is
harmless.
that
was
crucial
to
this
court's
opinion
in
barclay.
i
would
urge
the
court
to
take
a
look
at
the
case
decided
at
footnote
6
in
the
state's
opinion,
page
31.
a
reading
of
that...
those
opinions
will
show
that
what
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
done,
although,
as
the
state
agrees,
that
is
all
dicta
in
the
sense
that
it
wasn't
necessary
to
the
opinion
because
they
affirmed
the
especially
heinous
aggravating
circumstance
in
any
event,
what
they
have
done
is
automatically
affirm,
that
one
remaining
aggravating
circumstance
is
sufficient,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that,
for
example
in
this
case,
it
undercuts
half
of
the
state's
case
at
the
death
penalty
phase.
in
conclusion,
petitioner
requests
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
mississippi,
and
vacate
the
death
sentence.
thank
you.
