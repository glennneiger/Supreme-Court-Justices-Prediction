justice
white
well,
the
fifth
circuit
seems
to
agree
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
the
authority
under
state
law
to
do
just
what
it
did
in
this
case,
the
skargy
case,
it
seems
to
say
so.
justice
white
i
know
that,
but
this
was
no
more
than
a...
before
maynard
the
mississippi
courts
were
doing
this,
and
the
fifth
circuit
has
more
than
once
seemed
to
recognize
it
as
a
practice
under
mississippi
law.
justice
white
well,
it
said
that
mississippi...
mississippi
law
is
clear,
that
one
invalid
aggravating
circumstance
will
not
suffice
to
a
return.
that
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
said.
justice
white
there
was
a
mississippi
judge
on
the
panel.
justice
white
well,
if
it
went,
if
it
really
carried
that
out
in
detail
it
would
be
probably
exactly
what
they
would
do
if
they
expressly
reweighed.
justice
white
well,
it
may
be
they
would
have
had
to
do
more
on
the
harmless
error
than
they
would
just
by
reweighing.
justice
white
and,
unless
somebody
does
the
weighing,
they
aren't
following
the
statute.
and
if
the
mississippi
court
is
saying
this
is
just
a
rule
of
law,
we
don't
have...
if
we
invalidate
two
of
three
aggravating
circumstances,
but
nevertheless
affirm,
without
going
through
a
weighing
process
or
even
saying
the
aggravating
circumstance
nevertheless
outweighs
the
mitigating,
they
are
then
seemingly
disregarding
their
own
statute
that
is
still
the
law
in
mississippi.
justice
white
but
zant
was
about
georgia,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
and
that
is
not
a
weighing
state.
justice
white
mississippi
is.
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
in
georgia,
the...
a
rule
of
law
is
proffered,
if
there
is
one
aggravating
circumstance,
even
though
there
are
two
others
invalidated.
is
that
zant?
justice
white
the
difference
in
mississippi
is
that
it
is
a
weighing
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
vacate
and
remand
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
in
this
case.
justices
brennan
and
blackmun
have
each
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part;
justices
brennan,
marshall,
and
stevens
join
justice
blackmunâ€™s
opinion.
