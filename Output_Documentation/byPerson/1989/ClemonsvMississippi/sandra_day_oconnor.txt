justice
o'connor
mr.
resnick,
did
the
court
employ
also
a
harmless
error
analysis,
do
you
think,
in
its
opinion?
justice
o'connor
that
met
the
chapman
standard.
i
assume
it
was
a
state
standard,
but
one
meeting
perhaps
the
chapman
standard.
justice
o'connor
well,
you
don't
take
the
position
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
could
not
apply
a
harmless
error
standard
to
a
sentencing
error,
do
you?
justice
o'connor
does
it
have
just
a
flat,
automatic
rule,
so
long
as
one
aggravating
circumstance
remains,
it
will
affirm
a
death
penalty?
justice
o'connor
no?
justice
o'connor
but
does
it
have
an
automatic
rule
that
if
there
are
two
aggravating
circumstances,
and
one
drops
out,
that
it
will
affirm--
justice
o'connor
--you
don't
read
the
opinion
as
suggesting
that's
its
rule,
then?
justice
o'connor
do
they
say
that
in
the
opinion
anywhere?
did
i
miss
it?
justice
o'connor
meeting
the
chapman
standard?
justice
o'connor
did
they
refer
to
that?
justice
o'connor
how
would
we
know
that
it
did,
because
it
isn't
set
forth,
is
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
factors
are
not
set
forth
expressly
in
the
opinion,
so
how
do
we
know
they
followed
the
chapman--
