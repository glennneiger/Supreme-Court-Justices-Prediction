justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
this
case
coming
to
us
from
the
eleventh
circuit
concern
so-called
voluntary
admissions
to
a
florida
state
mental
hospital.
in
a
sense,
it
is
related
to
the
washington
against
harper
decision
announced
this
morning
by
justice
kennedy.
the
respondent
signed
forms
requesting
the
admission
and
treatment
at
the
hospital,
and
this
was
an
apparent
compliance
with
state
statutes,
but
after
his
release
he
brought
this
action
under
1983,
a
federal
statute,
against
petitioners
who
were
physicians
and
staff
members
of
the
hospital
on
the
ground
that
they
had
deprived
him
of
his
liberty
without
due
process
of
law.
the
complaint
alleged
that
they
violated
state
law
by
admitting
burch
as
a
voluntary
patient
when
they
knew
or
should
have
known
that
he
was
incompetent
to
give
informed
consent
and
that
their
failure
to
initiate
florida’s
involuntary
placement
procedure
denied
him
constitutionally
guaranteed
procedural
safeguards.
the
district
court
granted
the
defendant’s
motion
to
dismiss
under
cases
holding
that
a
depravation
of
a
protected
interest
caused
by
a
state
employee’s
random
and
unauthorized
conduct
does
not
give
rise
to
such
a
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
remanded.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
the
complaint
was
sufficient
to
state
a
claim
under
1983
for
violation
of
the
plaintiff’s
procedural
due
process
rights.
the
case
is
to
which
the
district
court
relied
to,
do
not
preclude
respondent’s
claim.
it
is
foreseeable
that
persons
requesting
treatment
might
be
incapable
of
informed
consent.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
the
chief
justice
and
justices
scalia
and
kennedy.
