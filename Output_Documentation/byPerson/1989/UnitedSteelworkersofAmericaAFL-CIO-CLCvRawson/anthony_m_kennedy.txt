suppose
that,
take
it
a
step
further.
the
contract
says
explicitly
the
union
shall
have
no
duty
to
inspect
the
mine.
this
is
solely
the
duty
of
the
employer.
the
union
then,
on
its
own,
tells
the
employees
we
have
inspected
mine
shaft
number
12
and
find
it
safe.
and
they
are
negligent
in
that
and
people
are
injured.
cause
of
action
there
against
the
union?
justice
kennedy
you
know
what
the
idaho
tort
law
is.
the
idaho
tort
law
is
there,
in
the
situation
i
put,
that
there
be
a
cause
of
action
for
negligence.
justice
kennedy
is
it
somehow
displaced
by
federal
law?
justice
kennedy
in
my
situation,
my
hypothetical,
i
want
you
to
stipulate
that
the
union
was
negligent
in
what
they
did.
would
there
be
a
federal
cause
of
action?
justice
kennedy
--so
in
effect
you
are
arguing
for
a
federal
immunity?
justice
kennedy
you
say
that
there
is
only
duty
of
fair
representation,
and
that
it
doesn't
include
that,
and
it's
not
state
law--
justice
kennedy
--but
you're
telling
us
that
it
doesn't.
justice
kennedy
i
take
it
that
includes
some
reliance
on
the
part
of
the
injured
party?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
under
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical,
if
you
have
some...
and
justice
stevens',
if
you
have
some
independent
volunteer
that
goes
down
there
and
makes
an
inspection,
that
person
is
liable
(a)
if
it
is
negligently
done
and
(b)
if
the
injured
party
reasonably
relies
on
it.
isn't
that
the
theory
of
the
idaho
court,
or
is
it?
