and
there
would
be
a
federal
cause
of
action.
justice

this
isn't
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
though.
it's
a
tort
arising
out
of
an
activity
that
it
was
performing
in
the
conduct
of
its
duty
of
fair...
we're
not
saying
that
the
union
has
violated
its
contractual
obligations
at
all.
we're...
your
thesis
is
if
a
tort
arises
out
of
its
either
express
contractual
performance,
or
out
of
any
other
aspect
of
its
trying
to
make
the
employer
accountable
for
the
relations
with
the
workers,
that
tort
is
excluded
from
state
law.
it's
a
separate
tort.
it's
not
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
now,
does
that
tort
exist
under
federal
law
or
not?
justice
scalia
there
is
just
no
such
tort.
all
you
have
is--
justice
scalia
as
i
understand
it
they
didn't
find
a
duty
to
inspect.
they
found
a
duty
to
inspect
carefully.
that
is
to
say,
if
you
do
inspect
you
have
a
duty
to
inspect
carefully.
but
they
didn't
find
a
duty
to
inspect,
did
they?
justice
scalia
then
i
really
don't
understand
the
case.
i
thought
what
the
idaho
court
was
saying
was
that
if
you
choose
to
inspect,
though
you
have
no
duty
to,
you
have
to
do
it
carefully.
which
is,
you
know,
sort
of
old
tort
law.
but
you
are
saying
that
that
is
not
what
they
said.
justice
scalia
they
said
there
was
a
duty
to
inspect.
justice
scalia
it
is
crucial
to
the
idaho
law
that
it
be
for
the
benefit
of
another,
right?
i
mean,
if...
if
the
people
who
did
inspecting
were
insurance
underwriters,
and
the
only
reason
they
are
looking
for
it
is
to
see
whether
it
is
worth
taking
out
a
policy
on
this
mine,
they
would
not
acquire
any
obligation
to
the
miners
by
that
inspection,
i
assume.
right?
justice
scalia
for
the
miners.
justice
scalia
so
the
only
way
you
really
get
this
union
is
because
the
union
did
it
for
the
workers,
and
doesn't
that
really
get
you
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
the
only
reason
you
know
that
these
people
are
not
like
insurance
underwriters
is
because
they
are
the
bargaining
representatives
of
these
people.
doesn't
the
whole
tort
ultimately
rest
upon
their
bargaining
representative
capacity?
justice
scalia
the
conduct
for
the
benefit
of
the
other.
the
thing
is,
it
seems
to
me
you
don't
quite
reach
your
goal
unless
you
prove
that
the
unit
did
it...
did
it
for
the
benefit
of
the
employees.
and
the
only
way
you
prove
that
is
to
show
the
jury
that
this
is
their
union.
of
course
it
is
doing
it
for
their
benefit.
it
is
not
an
insurance
underwriter.
and
that
gets
you
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it
seems
to
me.
it
gets
you
into
the
relationship
of
the
union
as
the
collective
bargaining
representative
of
the
employees.
