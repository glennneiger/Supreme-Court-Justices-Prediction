justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question?
is
there
any
place
in
your
pleading,
other
than
paragraph
13
of
the
complaint,
where
you
set
forth
your
concept
of
what
the
state
law
cause
of
action
is?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
and
they
were
written
at
a
time
when
you
apparently
did
rely
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
as
creating
some
of
the
duty.
justice
stevens
at
least
they
appear
to
be,
that
they
undertook--
justice
stevens
--the
failure
is
you...
they
failed
to
require
fire
drills,
and
they
failed
to
require
personal
protective
equipment.
that
sort
of
thing.
failed
to...
i
take
it
those
would
be
failures
in
its
bargaining
capacity
to
get
the
company
to
do
those
things,
the
way
you
described
them
there.
justice
stevens
i
still...
it's
still
hard
for
me
to
understand...
somehow
or
other
before
you
can
find
a
tort
you
have
got
to
find
what
the
duty
was
that
was
assumed,
just
exactly
what
its
dimensions
were
that
you
alleged
were...
i
am
still...
and
the
idaho
supreme
court
really
is
not
very
helpful.
it
says
they,
they
assumed
a
duty
by
engaging
in
this
conduct.
but
their
description
would
cover
my
hypothetical
case,
but
you
don't
seem
to
go
that
far.
my...
of
trade
association
or
just
some
volunteer
making
an
inspection.
what...
what
is
your...
maybe
you
could
just
state
it
for
me.
what
do
you
think
that
the
union's
duty
was?
justice
stevens
and
how
it
arose.
justice
stevens
what
do
you
mean
by
an
actual
capacity?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
if
their
conduct
measures
their
duty,
they
obviously
did
what
the
conduct
shows.
you
are
in
fact
saying
they
failed
to
do
something
more.
justice
stevens
well,
say
they...
they
look
at
a
lot
of
things
and
they
acquire
some
information.
now
what...
don't
you
have
to
say
they
have
some
duty
to
report
what
they
found
to
someone?
or
what?
i...
i'm
still
not...
i
mean,
they
have
looked
at
it,
they
have
engaged
in
the
conduct.
and
then
you
are
saying
they've
got
a
duty
to
do
something
more.
justice
stevens
and
where
is...
what
is
the
source
of
that
duty?
justice
stevens
well,
but
if
they're...
they're
being
accompanied
by
management
personnel,
and
they
both
look
at
the
same
thing,
are
you
in
effect
saying
that
they
saw
something
that
management
didn't
see,
and
they
had
to
tell
management
about
what
they
saw?
is
that
what
you...
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
talk
about
a
duty
to
report
to
management
when
it
is
a
joint
inspection.
justice
stevens
well,
i
think
they,
i
think
they
agree
that
if
they
promise
to
inspect
they
have
a
contractual
duty
to
inspect.
justice
stevens
how
do
you
know
what
they
undertook
to
do,
in
the
way
you
use
undertake?
how
do
you
know
what
they
did
underground?
justice
stevens
don't
you
think
the
union...
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
union
undertook,
or
what
it
did
underground
was
what
it
bargained
the
employer
out
of
letting
them
do?
what
did
they
actually...
what
did
the
contract
actually
entitle
the
union
to
do
underground?
just
to
accompany
the
federal
inspectors?
i
mean
the...
what
did
they
bargain
for
and
get
in
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
justice
stevens
well,
just
attend.
what
were
they
supposed
to
do?
they
just
went
with
them?
justice
stevens
xxx
a
union
is
going
to
be
ill
advised
ever
to
bargain
the
employer
out
of
the
privilege
of
attending
an
inspection.
justice
stevens
you
think
there
is
a
competitive
market
out
there
for
unions.
justice
stevens
really?
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
in
your
complaint
you
alleged
that
the
union
misrepresented
its
safety
concern
and
its
expertise
to
the
rank
and
file,
and
i
think
there
was
a
fraud...
in
effect
a
fraud
claim.
am
i
correct
that
that
is
out
of
the
case
now,
that
the
summary
judgment
was
entered
against
you
on
the
fraud
part
of
the
case?
justice
stevens
so
that
you,
you
don't
rely
at
all
on
a
theory
of
the
union
making...
at
this
point
in
the
case,
making
misrepresentations
to
its
members
about
its
own
ability
to
conduct
inspections
or
the
success
it
has
had
in
inspecting,
or
anything
like
that?
justice
stevens
just
that
they
were
negligent
in
doing
the
inspection.
you
say
on
the
contract?
justice
stevens
conduct,
all
right.
