justice
white
suppose,
mr.
cohen,
the
contract
here
expressly
put
a...
placed
a
duty
on
the
union,
namely
that
the
union
did
promise
to
inspect
the
mine.
you
would
take
the
same
position
that,
that
although
there...
i
suppose
there
would
be
a
301
action
against
the
union?
but
does
it
also
owe
a
duty
of
fair
representation
to
carry
out
that
duty
correctly?
justice
white
well,
what
about,
what
about
my
question
now?
justice
white
suppose
the
union
undertakes,
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
to
inspect
the
mine?
justice
white
because
that
is
what
this
case
is.
the
state
court,
as
i
understand
it,
construed
this
contract
as
the
union
undertaking
a
duty
to
inspect.
justice
white
so,
let's
assume
that
is
right.
then
what
about...
what
about
preemption?
justice
white
what
would
be
your
primary
position
then?
justice
white
well,
why
not?
why
not?
didn't
the--
justice
white
--do
you
agree
that
the
idaho
supreme
court
interpreted
the
collective
bargaining
contract
to
put
a
duty
on
the
union--
justice
white
--to
inspect?
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--now,
suppose
we
accept
that?
justice
white
suppose
we
accept
that?
you
need
to
wait
until
justice
white
finishes
with
his
question
before
you
begin
your
response.
suppose...
suppose...
suppose
he...
we
accept
that
construction
of
the
contract?
then
what
is
your
primary
position?
justice
white
you're
just
not
answering
my
question.
justice
white
well,
so,
if
we,
suppose
we
agree
with
them.
justice
white
it
would
be
preempted
because
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation?
justice
white
not
because
it's...
it
would
be
a
301
action?
justice
white
well,
that
is
your
fallback
position,
isn't
it?
justice
white
excuse
me,
mr.
cohen.
justice
white
is
it
your
position,
then,
that
there
is
a
federal
common
law
of
torts
against
the
union
for
any...
any
negligence
in
its
assumed
exercise
of
bargaining
activities?
justice
white
you,
you
would
say
that
this
court,
that
this
suit
could
have
been
brought
in
federal
court,
then,
on
a
federal
theory
that
the
union,
through
its
actions,
assumed
the
obligation
to
inspect,
and
its...
its
breach
of
that
assumption
gives
rise
to
a
federal
cause
of
action?
justice
white
no,
no,
no.
this
hasn't...
this
is
not...
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
collective...
let's
assume
there
was
nothing
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
at
all
about
accompanying
mine
inspectors
or
anything
else.
but,
in
point
of
fact,
the
union
got
into
the
habit
of
going
around
with
the,
with
the
mine
inspectors,
and
indeed...
just
what
the
state
court
said
here.
justice
white
well,
i
know
that,
but
this...
it
happens--
justice
white
well,
didn't...
didn't
the
idaho
supreme
court
find
a
duty
on
the
union
to
inspect?
justice
white
and
didn't
they
base
that
on
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
their
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
justice
white
how
do
you
say
it's
no?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
where
did
they
find...
purport
to
find
the
duty
to
inspect?
justice
white
they
didn't
say
that
just
any
collective
bargaining
agent
for
miners
has
a
duty
to
inspect
a
mine.
justice
white
well,
then,
under
state
law.
so
where
did
they
get
it?
justice
white
what
undertaking?
justice
white
may
i
ask
then,
if...
if
instead
of
a
union
we
had
here
a
trade
association
which
was
interested
in
improving
mine
safety
throughout
its...
all
the
member
companies,
and
they
sent
a
committee
along,
to
go
along
with
the
routine
inspection
by
the
employer.
they
had
three
people
just
go
along,
they
want
to
see
what
the...
how
they
are
doing,
and
they
are
sloppy.
they
don't
find
anything
that
is
in
plain
sight
and
they
don't
report
anything.
would
they
assume
a
liability
under
idaho
law
to
the
people
who
were
later
injured
by
an
explosion?
justice
white
well,
i
am
asking...
i
think
justice
scalia
and
i
are
both
trying
to
find
out
what
the
source
of
the
duty
is.
and
i
thought
your
response
was
the
source
of
the
duty
is
the
fact
that
they
did
in
fact
inspect.
justice
white
but
is
that...
if
that
is
enough,
then
in
my
trade
association
example
they
would
have
the
same
duty.
justice
white
but
what,
what
elements
are
there?
they
are
sloppy.
i
mean,
in
my
hypothesis
they
have
the
proof,
they
have
got
the
consent
of
the
company
to
go
along
on
whatever
the
periodic
inspection
is,
and
they
see
a
lot
of
stuff
that
somebody
ought
to
recognize
as
being
very
dangerous,
but
they
don't
tell
anybody.
they
figure
we're
going
to
write
notes
about
it,
and
in
the
future
when
we
write
our
report
we'll
say
these
are
dangerous
practices,
but
we
don't
feel
we
have
any
responsibility
other
than
to
find
out
what
we
can
during
the
course
of
inspection.
does
the
very
fact
that
they
are
making
an
inspection
impose
a
duty
to
do
anything
with
the
knowledge
they
gain
thereby?
justice
white
you
mean...
you
don't
mean
undertaking
in
the
sense
of
a
promise.
it's
just,
you...
just
by
conduct
you
act
in
a
way
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
somebody.
justice
white
xxx
the
employer
shifted...
the
employer
pays
what
it's...
what
it
has
had
to
pay.
but
what
it
has
had
to
pay
is
limited
by
idaho
law.
justice
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
well,
it...
it
was
held
to
have...
it
has
a
duty,
and
it
paid
for
it.
justice
white
it's
strict
liability,
is
it?
justice
white
to
a
limited
extent.
justice
white
but...
idaho
law
is
that
absent
some
third
party
undertaking
to
inspect
for
the
employer,
the
liability
of
the
employer
is
all
the
injured
miners
can
look
to.
justice
white
suppose
we
agree
with
you
that
the
union's
duty
is
measured
by
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
and
suppose
the
case...
and
you
say
you
can
be
sued
on
that
duty,
under
that
duty,
and
that
federal
law
controls.
suppose
the
case
goes
forward,
do
you
think
that
the
plaintiff
could
prove
a
breach
of
duty
of
fair
representation
by
proving
merely
negligence?
justice
white
in
this
context,
what
would
breach
the
duty
in
carrying
out
whatever
the
collective
bargaining...
would
it
have
to
be
arbitrary
conduct?
justice
white
well,
what
else
besides
discrimination?
justice
white
what
does
that
mean?
you
mean
negligence
is
not
arbitrary?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
idaho
in
this
case
is
reversed.
the
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk
explains
the
reasons
for
our
judgment.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
he
is
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia.
