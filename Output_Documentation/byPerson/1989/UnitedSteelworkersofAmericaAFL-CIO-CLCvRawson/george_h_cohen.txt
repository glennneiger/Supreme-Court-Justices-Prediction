mr.
george
h.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
united
steelworkers
of
america
negotiated
a
collective
bargaining
provision
with
the
sunshine
mining
company
giving
the
union
the
right
to
accompany
a
state
inspector
in
his
state
mine
inspection,
and
as
well
to
accompany
a
company
representative,
the
safety
engineer,
in
periodic
tours
of
the
mine.
the
steelworkers
union
thereafter
exercised
that
right
which
was
provided
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
supreme
court
of
idaho
ruled
that
solely
by
virtue
of
having
exercised
that
right,
the
union
assumed
the
affirmative
duty
under
idaho
tort
law
to
exercise
due
care
in
inspecting,
and
made
it
clear
that
what
it
meant
by
that
was
that
the
union
had
an
obligation
to
detect
any
safety
hazards
that
could
have
or
should
have
been
detected
in
the
course
of
a
reasonable
inspection.
the
issue
presented
in
this
court
is
whether
the
idaho
state
tort
law
is
preempted
by
the
federal
duty
of
fair
representation
which
governs
the
union
in
the
conduct
of
its
functions
in
administering
and
enforcing
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
bring
to
this
court
a
case
that
has
gone
through
summary
judgment,
extensive
discovery
and
a
spectrum
of
undisputed
facts.
insofar
as
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
concerned,
that
agreement,
as
i
stated,
makes
clear
that
the
union
has
these
two
particular
roles
in
accompanying
the
state
mine
and
the
company
inspector.
the
contract
begins
by
referring
to
the
fact
that
the
company
will
continue
to
assume
its
responsibility
to
provide
a
safe
and
healthful
work
place.
the
company
then
agrees
to
provide
the
union
the
limited
role
that
i
have
just
described.
the
contract
does
not
provide
that
the
union
has
a
right
on
its
own
to
inspect
the
mine,
and
the
contract
does
not
provide
that
the
union
shall
be
entitled
to
correct
any
defects
or
deficiencies
that
might
be
noticed
during
the
course
of
either
of
these
types
of
inspections.
indeed,
the
limited
nature
of
the
union's
role
is
reflected
in
part
by
the
fact
that
the
union,
under
federal
law,
did
not
have
the
right
to
even
accompany
a
federal
inspector
during
the
federal
inspections
of
the
mine,
and
the
company
would
not
permit
the
union
to
do
so.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
with
two...
there
is
two
aspects
of
the
preemption
issue.
one
would
be
the
question
of
interpretation,
but
there
is
a
more
threshold
proposition,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
parenthetically,
as
we
have
argued
in
our
brief,
there
is
no
question
but
that
before
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
union
assumed
any
duty,
because
before
the
union...
unless
and
until
the
union
assumes
a
duty,
there
can
be
no
tort
liability.
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
any
assumption
of
a
duty
would
have
to
turn
on
an
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
would
go
to
the
question
of
whether
a
tort
was
committed
under
state
law.
we
have
a
threshold
proposition.
the
threshold
proposition--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--no.
the
more
precise
formulation,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
be
that
when
you
are
interpreting
it
you
must
apply
federal
law,
whether
you
are
a
state
court
or
a
federal
court.
yes,
we
do
rely
on
that
in
our
supplemental
position
that
under
no
circumstance
could
there
ever
have
been
a
duty
found
to
exist
here
on
the
union
to
inspect.
but
the...
but
the
basic
premise
and
the
focus
of
our
position
is
that
effort
by
the
state
of
idaho
to
impose
a
tort
law
obligation
on
the
union,
arising
out
of
the,
quote,
mr.
chief
justice...
however
the,
anyone
wants
to
frame
the
actual
conduct,
the
union
was
engaged
in
that
conduct
exclusively
because
it
was
the
collective
bargaining
agent.
it
had
obtained
a
provision
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
to
permit
it
to
do
the
accompanying,
and
it
was
actually
exercising
that
right
to
accompany
the
inspector.
here
we
were,
then--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--well,
the
case
that
supports
our
primary
position
is
vaca
v.
sipes,
for
the
basic
proposition
that
insofar
as
the
representational
function
of
processing
of
grievance
and
administering
the
grievance
arbitration
proceeding
is
concerned,
there
is
a
federal
duty.
the
federal
duty
was
designed
to
accommodate
all
the
competing
interests,
carefully
delimitated
what
that
federal
duty
would
be,
and
that
federal
duty
occupies
the
field.
it
is
the
exclusive
duty,
insofar
as,
and
i
think
this
is--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--yes
it
does.
vaca
says
insofar
as
the
union
is
administering
the
contract
through
the
grievance
arbitration
proceeding,
federal
law
governs.
and
the
square
holding
of
vaca
was
the
missouri
supreme
court's
attempt
to
apply
missouri
law
to
impose
a
duty
on
the
union
different
from
the
federal
duty
of
fair
representation
could
not
stand,
and
in
fact
was
held
not
to
be
applicable.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
i
think
i
would
respond
as
follows,
justice
white.
theoretically,
as
this
court
in
fact
recognized
in
i.b.e.w.
v.
hechler,
theoretically
the
union
could
assume
by
contract
duties
in
excess
of
what
the
traditional
kind
of
representational
service
is.
that
is
at
least
theoretically
possible.
i
think
the
court
would
understand
and
appreciate
that
is
a
very
unlikely
circumstance,
given
the
reality
of
collective
bargaining,
the
union
acting
for
and
on
behalf
of
people
in
that
unit,
exacting
promises
and
commitments
from
the
employer.
it
would
be
a
very
unusual
circumstance
to
believe
that
in
that
process
of
collective
bargaining,
the
consequence
would
be
that
the
union
would
assume
a
duty
which
was
then
enforceable
by
members
of
the
bargaining
unit.
however,
even
were
that
to
take
place,
we
would
have
to
look
at
that
collective
bargaining
agreement,
interpret
it
to
see
is
this
that
very
unusual
circumstance
where
employer
permitted
a
union
to
assume
that
kind
of
authority,
and
in
fact,
the
union
actually
assumed
it.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
your
question,
as
i
understood
it,
was
in
that--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--that
would
not,
obviously,
be
this
case.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
the
state--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--all
right,
now--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--our
position
would
basically
be
this
court
has
not
addressed
that
problem.
but
it
would
be...
it
would
be...
there
are
circumstances
and
factors
and
considerations
at
work
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
that
are
not
at
work
here.
because
let
me
say--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--because
the
argument
would
be,
mr.,
justice
white,
the
argument
would
be,
in
that
kind
of
a
situation
the
union
arguably
is
displacing
the
managerial
function
of
inspecting,
and
the
union
then
would
be
assuming
what
would
traditionally
be
an
employer
role.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
absolutely.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
absolutely.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
but
we...
but
in
fact--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--but,
in
fact--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--accepting
the
construction
of
the
contract
as
the
findings
were
made
here
was
that
all
the
union
did
was
accompany.
if
we
accept
it...
there
is
no
disputed
fact
as
to
what
the
union's
conduct
was,
justice
white.
it
was
accompany.
in
fact,
the
state--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--the
state
court
characterized
it
as
doing
more.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
if
we
did
more,
if
we
did
more
our
position
would
be
as
long
as
the
union
was
basically
performing
a
representational
function,
and
what
they
were
trying
to
do
was
influencing
the
way
the
employer
carried
out
its
safety
and
health
responsibility,
that
would
continue
to
be
preempted.
we
do
recognize,
however--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--yes,
yes.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
it
would...
it
would
be
preempted
because
it
was
essentially
a
duty
of
fair
representation
case.
but
i
am
not
denying
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
a
provision
could
be
agreed
to
that
somehow
would
create
some
kind
of
an
additional
301
claim
that
might
be
enforceable.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
yes.
it's
a
fallback
in
this
sense.
this
court,
earlier
this
term
in
the
breininger
case,
where
what
was
involved
was
a
hiring
hall,
and
the
union
said
after
all
what
we
are
really
doing
is
taking
over
a
managerial
function,
this
court
said
well,
the
reality
is
you
are
administering
a
safety...
a
provision
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
insofar
as
you
are
doing
that,
the
federal
duty
of
fair
representation
governs
your
conduct,
and
you
must
conduct
yourself
consistent
with
that
federal
duty.
now,
the...
as
i
said,
the
vaca
case
directly
addressed
the
question
where
there
was
one
particular
type
of
representational
activity
involved,
one
particular
activity,
namely,
the
grievance
process.
the,
our
analysis
of
the
federal
law
is
that
that
same
approach
is
equally
applicable,
as
long
as
you
have
an
exclusive
bargaining
agent
functioning,
administering
or
enforcing
a
provision
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
is
the
nature
of
the
conduct
that
was
being
sought
to
be
regulated
here.
no
matter
how
you
want
to
characterize
the
plaintiffs'
theory,
the
complaint
alleged
at
the
beginning,
the
union
undertook
to
act
as
an
accident
prevention
representative
and
to
enforce
the
safety
and
health
articles
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
the
union
performed
that
service
negligently.
that
was
the
focus
in
which
this
case
proceeded.
it
has
continued
to
proceed
as
the
basic
thrust
of
the
plaintiffs.
our
position
is
that
insofar
as
that
aspect
of
the
union's
conduct
is
concerned,
the
union
has
a
duty.
now,
when
this
court
and
the
basic
national
labor
policy
reviewed
the
question
of
how
do
you
accommodate
the
interests
of
individual
employees,
their
bargaining
representative,
and
the
company,
when
you
have
that
kind
of
conduct
taking
place.
and
the
line
that
was
drawn,
the
effort
to
accommodate
all
those
competing
interests,
which
comes
right
out
of
the
core
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
when
a
union
is
conducting
its
activities,
was
to
say
on
the
one
hand
the
union
is
going
to
be
the
exclusive
representative,
the
representative
of
everyone
in
that
unit.
but
with
that
extraordinary
grant
of
power
we
have
to
accommodate
the
interests
of
individual
employees
against
such
abuses.
and
the
balance
that
was
struck
was
designed
to
assure
on
the
one
hand
employees'
rights
would
be
protected,
but
on
the
other
hand
the
union
would
be
left
in
a
position
that
it
could
be
a
viable
collective
bargaining
representative
and
serve
the
interests
of
everyone
in
the
bargaining
unit.
and
out
of
that
combination
of
interests
and
concerns
came
the
federal
duty
of
fair
representation,
a
duty
which
says
the
union
must
act
fairly
to
all
the
people
in
the
unit,
that
it
must
exercise
its
discretion
in
complete
good
faith
and
with
honesty
of
purpose
and
that
it
cannot
engage
in
any
hostility
or
discrimination
against
anyone
or
treat
anyone
arbitrarily.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
yes.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
justice
scalia,
i
wouldn't
say
it
is
a
federal
common...
federal
common
law
of
torts.
we
would
say
that
by
virtue
of
having
this
authority
and
responsibility,
that
principle,
that
federal
law
principle
governs
the
manner
in
which
the
union
conducts
itself,
incidentally
a
principle
in
which
negligence
has
no
role.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
we
would
say
that
there
is
a
federal
claim
for
the
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
that
there
always
is
when
a
union
is
conducting
itself
and
administering
and
enforcing
a
provision
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
i
am
sure
you
can
appreciate,
justice
scalia,
that
the
union,
i
know
of
no
instance
where
a
company
would
have
allowed
a
union--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--to
engage
in
that.
but
were
that
to
be
the
case,
the
union
still
is
functioning
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
and
the
federal...
it
would
be
a
federal
cause
of
action,
but
that
would
be
the
only
cause
of
action
for
that
kind
of
conduct,
because
what
the
union
is
trying
to
do
in
that
circumstance
is
to
influence
the
manner
in
which
the
employer
is
providing,
is
satisfying
its
relationship
to
that
union.
now,
in
most
cases
if
there
was
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
obviously
that
would
be
the
union's
purpose,
to
try
to
monitor
the
way
the
employer
was
living
up
to
its
commitments,
and
certainly
to
be
in
a
position
to
try
to
influence
the
employer
in
the
manner
in
which
the
employer
was
carrying
out
its
responsibilities.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
absolutely
could
sue
via
common
law
action.
it
could,
the
duty
of
fair
representation
would
play
no
role
in
that
kind
of
a
circumstance.
and
precisely
because
the
duty
of
fair
representation
would
place
no
role,
we
aren't
in
a
unique
circumstance--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--yes,
but
i
want
to--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--our
position
is
you
have
to
look
to
the
nature
of
the
conduct
in
question.
driving
an
automobile,
how
the
local
union
preserves
its
personal
property.
those
are
areas
where
we
have
acknowledged
in
our
brief...
indeed
i
don't
think
it's
acknowledgement...
are
completely
outside
the
parameters
of
the
operation
of
the
federal
duty
of
fair
representation.
all
common
law
obligations
that
any
other
citizen
would
owe
are
owed
by
the
union.
but
in
a
sense,
chief
justice,
that
highlights
the
contrast
from
the
actual
situation
presented
here,
because
here
we're
in
that
very
unique
area
where
the
union
is
functioning
as
the
exclusive
agent,
as
the
administrator
of
the
safety
and
health
provision,
and
as
the
representative
of
everyone
in
that
mine,
designed
to
influence
the
way
in
which
the
employer
is
conducting
its--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--well,
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
there
was
a
misrepresentation
by
the
union,
and
whether
it
would
be
reasonable
for
anyone
to
rely
on
that
circumstance.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
i...
i
still
believe--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--in
that
situation,
i
think,
once
again,
we
are
in
the
area
where
you
have
at
least,
the
argument
would
at
least
be
you're
predominantly
involved
in
the
union's
conducting
its
exclusive
representative
status
and
providing
services
to
individuals.
i
know
that
the
line
can
move
further
along
depending
on
a
spectrum
of
facts
and
circumstances.
certainly,
where
a
contract's
involved
we
don't
have
that
problem.
but
i
think
we
would
at
least
have
the
basis
for
maintaining
the
argument
that
there
still
is
the
functioning
of
the
union
in
its
traditional
representative
status
that
is
at
work
there.
i
recognize
there
could
be
competing
considerations
in
that
regard,
but
there
are
no
competing
considerations
here,
as
we
say,
because
there
is
no
dispute
that...
the
only
reason
the
union
was
functioning
here
was
because
it
had
obtained
a
provision
in
the
agreement
which
gave
it
the
limited
right
that
it
had
to
accompany
the
inspector.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
insofar
as
a
federal
cause
of
action
is
concerned,
mere
negligence
or
bad
judgment
does
not
on
the
merits
make
out
a
claim
for
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
there
is
a
good
reason
for
that,
and
the
reason
is
the
policy
concern
that
you
want
to
give
the
union
a
wide
range
of
reasonableness
when
it
is
conducting
its
activities
and
having
to
make
the
judgment
that
it
has
to
make
as
the
bargaining
representative.
should
we
inspect.
how
do
we
inspect.
what
kind
of
collective
bargaining
protections
are
we
going
to
try
to
achieve
in
the
contract.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
i
don't
believe
it
does.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
i
am
certainly
not
aware
of
one
that
does
this,
but
we
are
still
back
to
our
fundamental
proposition.
no
matter
how
the
court
tried
to
characterize
the
duty
it
was
trying
to
place
on
the
union,
it's
the
act
or
conduct
sought
to
be
regulated
that
is
the
key
consideration.
and
whether
it
is
a
tort
under
one
state
law
or
another,
the
bottom
line
is,
we
believe,
that
insofar
as
the
union
is
conducting
itself
as
the
exclusive
bargaining
representative,
doing
the
services
to
protect
people
in
the
unit,
then
there
is
no
room
for
state
law
to
apply.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
not
a
federal
immunity--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--justice
kennedy,
the...
if
the
federal
duty
of
fair
representation
applies,
then
there
is
a
legal
standard--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--in
the
case
that
we
are
concerned
with,
we
have
a
federal
duty
of
fair
representation
that
is
at
work,
is
the
exclusive
duty
and
the
governing
duty
as
to
our
conduct,
and
the
plaintiffs
have
abstained
proceeding
on
that
basis.
they
didn't
plead
any
breach
of
the
federal
duty.
they
didn't,
they
disclaimed
ever
relying
on
it.
and
after
all
these
years
of
summary
judgment
proceeding,
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
that
was
good
judgment
because
they
could
not
make
out
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
now,
if
the
idaho
state
law
decision
were
to
stand,
in
essence
what
that
court
has
said
is
merely
by
accompanying
the
inspector
they
determined
that
we
assumed
an
affirmative
duty
to
inspect.
and
here
is
where
the
union
would
be
left
in
those
circumstances.
either
we
would
have
to
in
fact
achieve
the
right
to
inspect,
to
conduct
our
own
inspections,
a
right
i
might
add
that
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
we
would
ever
achieve
from
this
employer
or
perhaps
any
other
employer,
given
the
state
of
this
record
that
they
wouldn't
even
allow
us
to
accompany
the
federal
inspector.
so
we
would
either
have
to
do
that
so
that
we
could
have
in
fact
a
meaningful
inspection
right,
or
we
would
have
to
choose
not
to
participate
in
circumstances
where
what
the
union
did
was
make
the
following
judgment.
we
are
going
to
have
rank
and
file
employees
accompany
the
inspector.
we
are
going
to
use
the
union's
representative,
the
rank
and
file
employee
status,
as
a
means
of
communication
to
allow
the
miners
who
are
actually
on
the
job,
who
are
facing
possible
hazards,
to
notify,
to
communicate
with
the
union
so
in
fact
those
concerns
could
be
passed
on
to
the
inspector
or
the
company.
that
was
the
judgment
that
the
union
made
as
to
how
it
was
going
to
conduct
its
activities.
and
to
set
aside
that,
to
allow
the
state
law
to
function
in
these
circumstances,
would
in
those
circumstances
in
essence
undermine
the
union's
right
to
have
made
this
judgment,
a
right
which
is
at
the
heart
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
and
the
accommodations
that
have
been
made
when
you
have
the
three
parties
at
work,
namely
the
individual
employee,
the
union
and
the
company.
i
think
i
will
reserve
my
remaining
time,
chief
justice.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
want
to
just
remind
the
court
we
are
here
on
summary
judgment.
the
state
of
the
record
is
undisputed
in
the
following
regards.
firstly,
that
the
only
reason
the
union
was
actually
performing
and
the
basis
for
the
performance
of
its
functions
was
a
direct
result
of
article
ix,
the
safety
and
health
article
of
the
contract.
that
is
einar
pederson's
affidavit
in
joint
appendix
page
47a.
he
was
a
member
of
the
local
union
safety
committee.
thereafter,
the
actual
conduct
that
the
union
engaged
in
was
totally
consistent
with
the
limited
role
that
was
given
to
it
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
role
in
relevant
part
of
accompanying
these
inspectors.
there
is
absolutely
no
record
evidence
to
indicate
that
the
union
on
its
own
conducted
any
inspections
of
this
mine.
insofar
as
the
question
concerning
whether
the
union
assumed
any
of
the
employer's
responsibilities
to
provide
a
safe
and
healthful
work
place,
the
trial
court,
after
the
full
summary
judgment
proceedings,
found,
at
page
100a
of
the
appendix,
that
in
fact
the
union
did
not
assume
the
employer's
role
or
responsibility
for
safety
and
health
at
this
work
place.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
yes.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
well,
they
laid
out
the
undisputed
facts--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--and
then
the
conclusion,
mr.
chief
justice,
was
the
defendant
did
not
undertake
to
perform
the
safety
functions
owed
by
the
sunshine
mine
to
rank
and
file
employees.
and
then
they...
they--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--yes.
as
well
as
the
documentary
evidence
which
demonstrated
what
the
employer's
responsibility
was.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
no,
i
don't,
mr.
justice
white,
and
i
believe
the
substance
of
this
court's
holdings
in
fashioning
the
duty
of
fair
representation
were
designed
to
avoid
that,
the
mere
negligence
or
bad
judgments,
because
on
balance,
in
balancing
all
the
competing
interests
that
are
at
work
here
there
was
a
recognition
that
that
would
unduly
hamstring
the
manner
in
which
the
union
was
supposed
to
operate
under
our
federal
labor
relations
system.
mr.
george
h.
cohen
discriminatory
conduct,
refusing
to
look
at
a
problem
that
a
particular
employee
called
to
their
attention
because
of
the
individual's
union
or
non-union
membership,
because
of
any
internal
political
disagreement--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--arbitrary
conduct
is,
of
course--
mr.
george
h.
cohen
--well,
as
of
this
point
in
time
the
court
certainly
has
not
accepted
the
proposition
that
negligence
is
arbitrary,
yes.
