chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
89-322,
united
steelworkers
of
america
v.
tharon
rawson.
mr.
cohen?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
cohen,
if
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
are
clear,
although
they
give
the
union
very
little
authority,
and
perhaps
the
supreme
court
of
idaho
has
piled
on
a
lot
of
responsibility
commensurate
with
that
authority,
i
don't
know
that
that
goes
to
the
preemption
question.
the
preemption
question,
i
thought,
was
whether
the
court
would
have
to
interpret
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
don't
rely
on
the
interpretation
aspect?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you...
i
still
don't
think
you
have
answered
my
question.
do
you
rely
on
that
part
of
the
preemption
doctrine,
as
you
describe
it,
which
says
you
cannot
as
a
state
court
interpret
a
collective
bargaining
agreement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
what...
what
of
our
cases
supports
this,
what
you
are,
is
apparently
your
primary
position?
chief
justice
rehnquist
certainly
vaca
doesn't
say
it
is
the
exclusive
duty,
does
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
cohen,
take
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
a
step
further,
if
you
will.
supposing
that
the
union
officers...
you
don't
need
to
look
at
the
clock.
suppose
that
the
union
officers
were
on
their
way
to
inspect
the
mine
in
a
union-owned
car
ran
over
someone
negligently.
now,
would
there
be
any
question
what
the
plaintiff
in
that
case,
the
injured
person,
could
sue
in
the
idaho
state
courts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
so
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
really
played
no
part
in
justice
scalia's
hypothetical,
then
that
would
mean
that
that...
this...
that
action
too
would
be...
could
be
brought
in
state
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
your
position
is
contrary,
i
realize
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
cohen.
mr.
howard,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
howard.
mr.
cohen,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
say
the
trial
court
found
after
summary
judgment
proceedings.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ordinarily
trial
courts
don't
make
findings
of
fact
in
summary
judgment
proceedings.
how
did
this
happen?
chief
justice
rehnquist
undisputed
facts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the
trial
court
found
that
because
both
parties
agreed
that
it
was
correct,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cohen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-322,
united
steelsorkers
of
america
versus
rawson
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
