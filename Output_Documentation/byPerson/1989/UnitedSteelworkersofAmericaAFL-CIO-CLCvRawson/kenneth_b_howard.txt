mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
two
issues
that
have
been
raised
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
one
is
whether
or
not
the
idaho
common
law
is
preempted
by
301
in
this
particular
instance,
and
the
second
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
duty
of
fair
representation,
and
whether
that
is
the
only
duty,
the
sole
duty
that
the
union
owes
under
this
kind
of
a
circumstance.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
yes...
yes--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--yes
and
no.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
the
supreme
court
in
its...
it
had
three
opinions
on
this
particular
case.
if
you
read
all
of
the
opinions
there
is
discussion
in
those
opinions
about
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
but
after
the
case
was
remanded
to
the
idaho
supreme
court
and
it
reviewed
its
language
in
the
context
of
the
hechler
decision
by
this
court,
the
idaho
supreme
court
clearly
said
we
are
not
looking
to
and
don't
care
about
what
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
says.
that
is
not
important
in
establishing
whether
or
not
there
is
a
state-based
cause
of
action
established--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--the
duty
to--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--no,
clearly
not.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
the
duty
to
inspect
comes
from
the
undertaking
itself.
it
comes
from--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--the
undertaking
of
going
down
and
inspecting.
you
look
at
the
conduct,
at
the
actions
involved
in
the
inspecting.
had...
had
the
union,
under
idaho
law,
had
the
union
promised
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
for
instance,
to
inspect,
and
never
inspected,
there
would
be
no
cause
of
action
under
idaho
law.
idaho
law
does
not
recognize
a
breach
of
a
contract
by
failure
to
do
something
that
you
promised
to
do.
there
is
no
such
tort--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
they
did
find
a
duty
to
inspect
based
upon
the
facts
in
the
record
at
this
point
in
time.
obviously,
here,
we
have
not
had
a
trial
on
the
merits
yet.
we
are
addressing
this
case,
even
after
these
18
years,
based
upon
the
status
of
the
record.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
no.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
i
believe
that
they
said
if
we
can
prove,
if
the
plaintiffs
can
prove
that
there
was
in
fact
an
inspection
taking
place,
that
is
our
obligation,
then
there
is
a
duty
to
do
it
carefully.
yes,
there
is
a
duty
to
do
it
with
reasonable
care.
that
is
part
of
our
burden
of
proof
though,
is
to
show
the
undertaking
itself.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
i
am
sorry,
i
don't
understand.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
that's
correct.
i
believe
that
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
justice
stevens,
the
idaho
law
relating
to
this
subject
requires
certain
foundational
elements
be
proved
before
you
can
determine
whether
somebody
has
established
the
necessary
undertaking.
it
has
to
be
an
undertaking
under
either
323
or
324--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
if
the
inspection
rises
to
the
level
necessary
to
meet
the
elements
of
the
cause,
the
state
recognized
cause
of
action,
yes.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
to
the
extent
that
we
have
the
words
of
the
idaho
supreme
court,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
the
elements
that
were
asserted
at
the
time
that,
and
were
inferentially
but
not
specifically
adopted
by
the
idaho
supreme
court,
was
that
the
elements
that
are
contained
in
the
restatement
of
torts
324a.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
some
reliance
on
behalf
of
either
the
injured
party
or,
if
it
is
324...
or
excuse
me,
324a,
it
can
be
the
undertaking
that
is,
an
undertaking
taken
on
behalf
of
someone
else
for
the
protection
of
a
third
party.
there
you
can
have
the
reliance
of
either
the
third
party
or
the
person
who
you
undertook
the
reliance
for.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
justice
o'connor--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--the
duty
recognized
by
the
idaho
supreme
court
does
not
rely
at
all
upon
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
had
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
laid
down
certain
guidelines--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--that
is
correct.
it...
but--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--do
not...
we
do
not
take
that
position,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
not
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
by
an
examination
of
the
conduct
itself.
if,
for
instance,
we...
we
were
examining
the
conduct
of
the
union
in
this
particular
case
with
regard
to
an
inspection,
and
there
was
never
an
inspection
with
regard
to
a
certain
area
of
the
mine.
they
never
walked
into
it
but
they
did
inspect
a
different
area
of
the
mine,
but
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
said
you
should
inspect
the
whole
mine.
we
could
not
rely
upon
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
under
idaho
law.
also,
with
regard--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--those
are
two
of
the
elements
involved.
the
elements
also
involved...
it
has
to
be
an
undertaking
of
services
for
the
protection
of
another.
that
is
why
it
is
relevant
in
this
case,
particularly
with
regard
to
safety.
the
restatement
of
torts
is
not
just
talk
about
any
kind
of
undertaking,
it
talks
about
the
undertaking
of
services
for
the
protection
of
another,
and
it
has
to
then
either
increase
the
risk
of
harm
or
it
has
to
call
for
some
reliance
on
the
part
of
the
parties
involved.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
it
is
the
conduct
itself
which
is
the
focus
of
the
examination
under
the
idaho
law
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
justice
scalia,
yes,
absent
some
showing
that
they
undertook
for
that--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--right.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
justice
scalia,
i
don't
believe
that
it
does.
what
the
common
law
of
idaho
does
is
supply
that
same
kind
of
an
obligation
to
anyone.
it
isn't
just
a
union,
you
don't
just
have
to
go
back
to
the
union
undertaking
the
services
for
the
protection
of
another
on
behalf
of
the
employer.
if
the
union
nonetheless
has
that
obligation
or
takes
on
that
obligation
under
its
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
has
an
independent
duty,
a
parallel
duty,
if
you
will,
under
the
state
law,
then
the
state
law
does
provide
this
obligation.
the
state
law
doesn't
arise,
however,
unless
the
union
actively
engages
in
the
conduct
itself,
and
the
examination
of
the
conduct
yields
the
duty.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
i
don't
believe,
justice
scalia,
that
the
idaho
law
or
the
restatement
of
torts
requires
that
it
be
for
the
benefit
necessarily
of
the
union
members.
the
elements
are
that
the
services
are
services
to
another,
and
they
are
undertaken...
the
services
that
are
owed
by
a
third
person
for
the
protection
of
a
third
person.
now,
the
benefit
may,
may
in
fact
flow
to
the
employer
in
this
case,
who
is
having
part
of
its
obligation
as
an
employer
undertaken
by
the
union.
the
union
may
view
it,
and
even
the
union
members
may
view
it
in
fact
as
a
partial
benefit
to
them.
but
in
fact
the
employer
may
be
receiving
the
benefit,
so
i
am
not
sure
an
analysis
strictly
based
on
benefit
is
consistent
with
the
restatement
position.
we
look
at
whether
or
not
the
services
are
undertaken
for
the
benefit
of
another,
for
the
protection
of
another,
and
whether
or
not
those
services
are
owed
by
a
third
person.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
within
the
pleading
itself,
meaning
the--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--complaint,
not
the
interrogatories
and--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--no,
there
is
not.
that
is
the
extent
of
the
pleadings
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case,
i
think
are
the
ones
that
are
in
the
appendix--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--i
think--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--i
think,
justice
stevens,
that
they
were
written
at
a
time
when
the
basic
notice
pleadings
were
the
foundational
view
that
we
were
taking
in
this
particular
case.
we
had
established...
we
had
pled
that
there
was
a
duty
that
arose
under
state
law--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--no,
there
were
failures
in
terms
of
the
conduct
of
what
was
done
and
what
was
done
negligently
with
regard
to
this
particular
undertaking.
under
the
idaho
law,
if
we
cannot
prove
that
there
was
in
fact
conduct
which
was
undertaken
and
done
negligently,
we
lose
this
case
on
a
factual
basis.
we
do
not
carry
our
burden
of
proof.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
the
union,
by
actually
engaging
in
the
inspections,
by
going
underground
and
by
factually
addressing
issues
in
an
actual
capacity--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--going
underground,
making
the
inspections--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--for
the
purposes
of
an
inspection.
and
with
regard,
in
this
particular
case,
to
inspections
that
were
owed
in
part
by
the
employer.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
the
fact
that
the
employer
owes
a
fundamental
duty
to
provide
a
safe
place
for
its...
for
its
workers.
in
this
particular
case,
and
part
of
our
burden
of
proof
is,
at
the
time
of
trial,
to
show
that
this
undertaking
was
one
that
was
owed
by
another,
owed
by
the
employer.
so
the
duty
to
provide
a
reasonably
safe
place
to
work
has,
as
part
and
parcel
of
it,
a
duty
to
inspect
and
to
examine
the
premises,
and
to
determine
what
unsafe
conditions
may
exist
and
what
needs
to
corrected,
and
what
the
corrective
process
should
be.
to
the
extent
that
the
union
actually
engaged
in
that
conduct,
that
is
the
extent
of
the
duty
that
i
think
that
the
idaho
supreme
court
has
established
that
the
union
owes
in
this
case--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--no,
what
i
am
saying,
justice
stevens,
is
that
once
they
engage
in
that
duty,
then
they
have
to
do
it
in
a
reasonably
prudent
fashion.
they
have
to
exercise
due
care.
the
due
care
becomes
the
standard
with
which
they
discharge
that
duty.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
they
have
a
duty
to
do
something
with
that
information,
yes,
to
act--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--the
duty
just,
again,
is
to
act
with
regard
to
reasonable
care.
now,
what
reasonable
care
is
under
the
circumstances
of
this
particular
case
is
what
did
they
do
and
was
it
reasonable.
they
could
report
this
particular
deficiency,
whatever
it
may
be,
or
corrective
process,
to
management.
if
manage...
if
they
had
no
obligation
more
than
that,
and
that...
and
they
did
not
carry
out
that
reporting
aspect
of
it,
and
did
not
act
with
due
care
with
regard
to
that
reporting--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--but
there
may
be
a
number
of
things
that
you
see
underground,
maybe
jointly,
maybe
not,
but
the
obligation
then
is
to
carry
out
some
kind
of
an
activity
to
bring
those
deficiencies
to
the
attention
of
the
individual
who
has
the
ability
to
correct
them.
that
may
be
by
way
of
discussion.
that
may
be
by
way
of
reporting
through
a
committee
or
reporting
directly
to
some
supervisor
about
the
deficiency.
but
that
is
the
due
care
required
in
this
particular
case
is
that
to
the
extent
that
they
engaged
in
that
conduct,
they
must
do
it
with
due
care.
they
have
indicated
they
don't
have
that
duty
of
due
care
at
all.
all
they
have
is
a
duty
of
fair
representation,
and
that
fair
representation
duty
does
not
extend
to
due
care.
it
extends
only
to
the
extent
that
they--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--justice
white,
i
think
that...
at
least
my
reading
of
the
union's
position
is
that
to
the
extent
that
they
undertook
a
duty
to
inspect,
which
they
deny...
specifically
they
deny
that
they
inspected
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
we
have
to,
we
have
to
get...
glean
that
information
from
the
factual
circumstance
of
the
case.
that
is
to
call
witnesses
and
to
look
at
examination
of
records
to
find
out
what
they
did.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
the
position
which
the
union
has
taken,
and
i,
which
i
concur
in,
quite
frankly,
that
the
collective
bargaining
gave
them
by
way
of
rights
is
several
things.
to
attend
certain
visits
and
inspections
by
the
state
inspector
but
not
by
the
federal
inspector.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
that's
all,
that's
all
they
are
saying
they
had
to
do.
they
had
no
duty
to
inspect.
well,
what
do
you
think
they--
--i
believe
that
they
actually
undertook
an
inspection.
i
believe
that
the
proofs
in
this
case
show
that
they
actually
inspected
and
reported
deficiencies,
and
they
made
recommendations,
and
that
they
used
the
occasion
of
those
inspections
in
order
to
determine
dangerous
conditions
underground
and
try
and
achieve
some
corrective
process,
which
was
outside
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it
was
under
the
state
law
of
idaho.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
their
powers
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
we
don't
examine
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
at
all
to
find
out
what
they
could
have
done
or
what
they
should
have
done.
what
we
examine
is
their
actions
and
find
out
what
they
did
do,
and
did
they
in
fact
carry
that
out
in
a
reasonable
fashion.
and
the
answer
in
that
case
is...
in
this
particular
case
is
no.
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
they
had
set
up
a
joint
safety
committee
consisting
of
union
as
well
as
management
individuals.
and
they
would,
after
these
inspections,
go
back
and
visit
during
these
safety
meetings
for
the
purpose
of
exchanging
information
and
making
recommendations
for
corrective
action.
to
the
extent
that
they
engaged
in
that
activity,
regardless
of
what
the
union
provided,
or,
excuse
me,
regardless
of
what
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provided,
to
the
extent
that
they
engaged
in
the
activity,
the
reporting
those
deficiencies,
they
had
a
duty
to
do
it
in
a
reasonable
fashion.
and
that
is
all
that
the
idaho
law
says.
and
there
is
no
comparable
federal
law
with
regard
to
enforcing
that
kind
of
a
remedy.
the
union
has
taken
the
position
here
that
its
only
duty
is
that
of
fair
representation,
which
does
not...
never
raises
to
the
level
of
due
care.
it
simply
stops
at
having
a
duty
not
to
exercise
discriminatory
conduct
or
act
in
an
arbitrary
fashion.
in
this
particular
case
it's
odd
that
the
union
should
say
that
it
has
only
a
duty
of
fair
representation
because,
first,
in
order
to
have
a
duty
of
fair
representation
i
would
think
that
they
would
have
to
be
working
within
the
confines
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
our
position
is
that
they
were
not.
they
were
working
within
the
confines
of
duty...
duties
that
were
actually
undertaken
underground.
and
therefore
their
duty
is
one
of
due
care.
and
that
can't
be
described
by
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
which
only
reflects
upon
their
traditional
role
as
a
collective
bargaining
agent,
as
an
agent
or
an
entity
for
the
purposes
of
achieving
grievances.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
well,
justice
white,
i
don't
think
they
would
be
ill
advised
at
all.
i
think
the
reality
of
present
day
unionism
is
that,
like
any
other
economic
activity
in
our
country,
they
have
to
go
out
and
compete
for
members.
and
they
are
going
to
provide
the
best
possible
service.
if
the
federal
law
only
provides
that
that
service
never
accompanies,
or
never
reaches
the
level
of
reasonable
care,
then
they
won't
achieve
reasonable
care.
however,
if
the
state
law
is
there
to
protect
the
employees
with
regard
to
the
duty
of
reasonable
care,
then
everybody
will
engage
in
reasonable
care
and
we'll
have
a
safer
work
place.
mr.

mr.

that
is
correct.
the
fraud

is

mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
one
of
the
aspects
of
this
case
with
regard
to
the
duty
of
fair
representation
that
is
interesting
with
regard
to
the
union's
position
at
any
rate
is
that
there
are
a
number
of
developing
areas
where
unions
are
now
starting
to
engage
in
traditional
roles
which
had
heretofore
been
strictly
the
roles
of
employers.
unions
are
starting
to
own
businesses,
to
direct
businesses,
to
manage
businesses,
as
well
as
being
unions.
there
has
to
be
a
line
someplace
between
where
this
duty
of
fair
representation
stops
and
the
duty
of
due
care
that
may
be
owed
by
these
other
roles
which
the
union
is
engaging
in
begins.
and
that
is
exactly
the
demarcation,
the
line
that
is
drawn
in
part
by
this
state
law.
that
state
law
here
indicates
that
where
the
union
engages
in
an
activity,
where
it
actually
undertakes
an
activity
owed
by
another,
in
this
case
by
the
employer,
it
is
now
taking
on
a
partial
role
of
the
employer,
it
must
live
up
to
that
duty
of
care
which
the
employer
would
owe.
it
doesn't
have
a
lesser
duty
of
care,
and
can't
be
given
a
lesser
duty
of
care
with
regard
to
that
particular
aspect
of
its
undertaking,
or
it
would
do
violence
to
the
fact
that
here
we
have
a
duty
which
would
normally
be
owed
by
an
employer,
where
they
would
owe
due
care,
but
now,
because
the
employer
can
shift
it
to
the
union,
the
union
does
not
owe
the
due
care.
the
union
only
owes
a
different
duty,
and
that
is
to
avoid
discriminatory
or
arbitrary
conduct.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
but
even
under
idaho
law
the--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--well,
the
employer
has
a
right
under
idaho...
yes,
the
employer
has
a
right
under
idaho
law
to
retain--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--but
idaho
law--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--well--
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
--idaho
law
has...
the
workmen's
compensation
law
for
idaho
certainly
has
a
duty
owed
by
the
employer,
and
it
has
set
up
a
system
in
order
to...
in
exchange
for
the
duties
owed
by
the
employer
directly
in
the
employment
capacity,
to
a
statutory
scheme.
but
idaho
law
specifically
addresses
the
liability
of
third
parties
who
may
be
engaged
by
the
employer
within
that
employment
circumstance.
that
protection,
that
workmen's
comp
shield,
only
applies
to
the
immediate
employer.
it
does
not
apply
to
any
third
parties,
whether
they
are
supplying
machinery
or
supplying
goods
or
services
or
supplying
inspection
services.
and
the
idaho
court
has
long
acknowledged
that
the
remedies
available
through
the
comp
system
are
not
intended
through
the
employer
to
act
as
a
complete
source
of
remedies
for
injured
people
within
the
work
place,
that
there
are
other
sources
of
those
remedies.
and
the
comp
statute
specifically
recognizes
and
authorizes
that.
the
union
simply
falls,
in
this
particular
case,
into
the
same
category
that
anybody
would
who
was
engaging
in
inspection
activities
and
safety-related
activities
with
regard
to
working
individuals
in
the
work
place,
and
making
advices
to
the
employer.
to
the
extent
that
they
did
that
as
a
private
individual,
whether
under
a
contract
or
whether
under
some
other
kind
of
an
undertaking,
to
the
extent
that
they
did
that,
they
did
it
negligently.
mr.
kenneth
b.
howard
if
the...
that
is
correct.
if
there
are
no
other
third
parties
who
are
engaged
in
activity
which
contribute
to
the
loss,
then
the
workmen's
compensation
is
the
sole
remedy
which
would
be
available
to
the
employees.
thank
you.
