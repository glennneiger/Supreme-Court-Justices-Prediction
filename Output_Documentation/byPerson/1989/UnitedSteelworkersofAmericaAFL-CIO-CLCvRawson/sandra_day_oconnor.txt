justice
o'connor
well,
how
can
you
proceed
in
the
tort
action
in
idaho
without
establishing
or
relying
upon
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provision
regarding
the
union
participation
in
the
inspection?
justice
o'connor
won't
that
have
to
be
part
of
your
cause
of
action?
and
i
assume
it
will
be
part
of
the
defense
as
well,
to
try
to
show
the
reasonableness
of
any
reliance
and
the
extent
of
any
duty.
justice
o'connor
but
you
say
it
did
rely
on
a
restatement
view
of
this
type
of
tort
action.
justice
o'connor
so,
ultimately
there
is
going
to
have
to
be
some
kind
of
duty
established.
otherwise,
as
justice
stevens
suggests,
any
volunteer
going
along
on
an
inspection,
a
newspaper
reporter,
anybody,
would
become
automatically
liable.
and
you
surely
don't
take
that
position.
justice
o'connor
so
you
have
to
rely
on
the
nature
of
the
duty
created
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
don't
you?
