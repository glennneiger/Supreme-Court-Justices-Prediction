mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
meaning
of
the
term
child
support
payments
in
a
provision
of
the
statute
regarding
the
aid
to
families
with
dependent
children,
or
afdc
program.
under
that
provision,
the
first
$50
per
month
of
child
support
is
disregarded
or
not
counted
in
afdc
eligibility
and
assistance
determinations.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether,
as
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
has
determined,
the
term
child
support
payments
refers
to
payments
from
absent
parents,
and
does
not
include
social
security
child's
insurance
benefits,
or
whether,
as
respondents
contend
and
as
the
court
of
appeals
concluded,
the
term
means
not
only
payments
from
absent
parents,
but
also
social
security
child's
insurance
benefits.
we
believe
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
should
be
upheld
for
three
reasons.
first,
the
term
child
support
is
used
repeatedly
in
the
social
security
act
to
refer
to
payments
from
absent
parents.
indeed,
the
current
version
of
the
disregard,
as
it
was
amended
in
1988,
explicitly
refers
to
payments
by
the
absent
parent.
second,
the
legislative
history
and
background
of
the
afdc
program
reveal
a
consistent
emphasis
on
the
problem
of
obtaining
payments
from
absent
parents
and
the
only
prior
instance
of
a
child
support
disregard
as
part
of
that
emphasis.
it
is
reasonable
to
view
this
disregard
in
light
of
that
long
standing
emphasis.
third,
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
entitled
to
deference.
now,
a
few
words
of
background.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
it
does,
justice
white.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that
is
true.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
it...
it
is
a
term
of
art
within
the
statute.
if
you
look
at
title
iv
of
the
social
security
act,
and
the
afdc
program
is
iv-a
of
the
social
security
act,
there
is
an
entire
part
of
the
social
security
act,
title
iv-d,
that
is
addressed
to
child
support.
and
throughout
both
title
iv-a,
which
has
a
close
relationship
to
title
iv-d,
and
title
iv-d,
child
support
refers
to
payments
from
absent
parents.
now,
the
linchpin
of
the
relationship
between
title
iv-a
and
title
iv-d
is
the
requirement
that
has
been
in
the
afdc
program
since
1975,
that
an
afdc
recipient
assign
rights
to
child
support
to
the
state,
and
the
state
then
collects
them.
the
entire
iv-d
system,
as
it
relates
to
the
four...
as
it
relates
to
afdc
recipients,
hinges
on
that
assignment
of
rights.
and
so
it
is
reasonable
to
view
the
term
child
support
payments,
even
though
it
says
any
child
support
payments,
in
view
of
its
repeated
meaning
throughout
the
act.
that...
it's
important
to
understand
why
this
assignment
of
rights
developed
in
1975,
and
why
the
title
iv-d
program,
insofar
as
it
applies
to
afdc
recipients,
was
developed.
and
that
is
because
repeatedly
congress
has
identified
the
problem
of
obtaining
payments
from
absent
parents
as
one
of
the
chief
reasons
that
people
are
on
afdc,
and
that
problem
is
one
of
the
chief
obstacles
to
getting
people
off
of
afdc
and
on
the
road
to
self-sufficiency.
and
it...
it's
a
very
particular
defined
problem.
and
congress
has
tried
a
number
of
different
ways,
it
has
been
a
frustrating
problem
to
get
at
that
problem.
and
that
is
why
child
support
is
in
title
iv
to
begin
with.
and
so...
and
in
no
other
context
in
title
iv
of
the
social
security
act
is
it
applied
to
social
security
benefits.
let
me
give
you
some
examples.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
the
word
any
modifies
the
term
child
support,
and
we
believe
that
the--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
i
think
even
if
you
italicize
the
"any",
you
still
have
the
word
"child
support",
and
you
have
to
interpret
what
that
means.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
place
to
look
for
that
is
the
meaning
that
it
has
elsewhere
in
the
statute.
now,
it's
not
an
unusual
phenomenon
for
two
words
to
have
a
different
meaning
if
you
separate
them
than
they
have
together.
child
support:
does
it
support
children?
yes,
it
does.
but
there
was
a
recent
decision
in
the
d.c.
circuit
of
judge
ginsberg
addressing
the
freedom
of
information
act
that
talked
about
this
problem.
and
in
that
opinion
judge
ginsberg
discussed
the
fact
that
the
term
parking
ticket,
for
example,
has
a
particular
meaning.
but
if
you
separate
it
as
a
ticket
for
parking
it
could
mean
the
ticket
that
you
get
to
go
into
a
garage
that
allows
you
to
park
your
car
there.
and
it's
a
similar
situation
here,
that
the
term
child
support
has
a
particular
meaning
in
the
statute,
that
to
just
ask
well,
does
this
support
children
does
damage
to
that
meaning
that
it
has
in
the
other
provisions
of
the
social
security
act.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
there
is
a
disregard
in
certain
limited
circumstances,
justice
o'connor.
and
let
me
back
up
and
explain
the
secretary's
interpretation.
within
weeks
of
the
amendments
that
passed
this
disregard
initially
in
1984,
the
secretary
determined
that
they
should
apply
to
payments
from
absent
parents,
and
enumerated
the
payments
that
go
to
the
state
that
are
also
passed
through
to
the
family,
also
direct
support
payments
which
still
go
to
the
family
and
voluntary
support
payments.
subsequently,
the
secretary
has
determined
that
in
addition
to
those
categories
of
payments
from
absent
parents,
spousal
support
payments
in
limited
circumstances
get
the
disregard.
and
those
circumstances
are
basically
when
the
spousal
support
payments
are
from
an
absent
parent
and
are
linked
to
child
support
payments.
three
conditions
have
to
be
met
for
those
spousal
support
payments
to
be
collected
and
to
get
the
disregard.
first,
there
has
to
have
been
established
support
obligations
from
the
absent
parent
to
both
the
spouse
and
the
child.
second,
the
spouse
and
the
child
have
to
be
living
in
the
same
house.
and
third,
the
state
has
to
be
collecting
the
spouse's
support
along
with
the
child
support.
now,
in
the
secretary's
determination
that
those
spousal
support
payments
were
entitled
to
the
disregard,
he
cited
section
12
of
the
child
support
enforcement
amendments
of
1984.
that
was
the
provision
that
said
that
the
states
should
collect
spousal
support
payments
in
those
circumstances.
and
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision
is
clear
that
the
reason
for
that
is
because
in
those
limited
circumstances
the
spousal
support
can
be
seen
as
having
a
child
support
purpose.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that
is
true,
although
they
are
linked
so
closely
to
child
support
that
congress
has
determined
that
they
serve
a
child
support
purpose.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that
is
true,
with
this
important
difference,
justice
o'connor.
those
spousal
support
payments
are
coming
from
the
absent
parent.
the
absent
parent
has
repeatedly
been
identified
in
the
afdc
program
as
the
reason
people
are
on
afdc.
there
is
no
similar
history
with
title
ii
benefits,
and
it
comes
as
part
of
a
sustained
congressional
effort
to
get
that
absent
parent
to
fulfil
his
obligations.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
no,
they
don't,
justice
o'connor.
what
they
do
is
they
expressly
include
payments
from
absent
parents.
now,
title
ii
benefits
would
be
included
as
unearned
income,
and
there
would
be
no
authority
to
exclude...
to
give
them
the
disregard.
so,
by
the
fact
that
the
secretary
carefully
limited
the
payments
that
were
entitled
to
the
disregard
and
didn't
suggest
that
any
other
payments
might
be
entitled
to
them,
they
are
excluded
from
the
disregard.
and
in
some
ways
it
is
not
surprising
that
the
secretary
didn't,
because
in
no
other
context
has
social
security
benefits
ever
been
treated
as
child
support,
in
the
secretary's
administration
of
the
afdc
program,
of
the
child
support
program
under
title
iv-d
and
of
the
title
ii
child's
insurance
benefits
programs.
the
secretary
is
the
official
who
has
been
charged
by
congress
with
implementing
all
three
of
those
programs,
and
this
issue
of
treating
title
ii
benefits
as
child
support
had
simply
not
come
up,
because
it
was
so
different
from
the
way
that
child
support
is
treated
in
other
provisions.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that
is
the
term
the
statute
gives
to
them,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
that
is
correct.
now,
a
few
examples
of
the
use
of
child
support
in
other
context--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--in
title
ii,
in
42
u.s.c.,
let
me--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--pardon?
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
yes,
i
believe
it
is
the
heading,
justice
white.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
okay.
i
will
accept
that.
[laughter]
but
i
don't
think
that
the
critical
question
in
any
case
is
whether
they
are
called
child's
insurance
benefits.
the
critical
point
is
that
they
are
not
called
child
support,
and
they
are
not
called
that
in
title
ii,
and
they
are
not
called
that
in
title
iv.
and
in
title
iv,
in
the
afdc
program
since
1975,
it
has
been
a
requirement
for
the
state's
participation
in
the
afdc
program
that
the
state
administer
a
child
support
program
in
conformity
with
the
directions
of,
at
that
time,
the
secretary
of
health,
education,
and
welfare,
and
now
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services.
and
it
has
never
been
part
of
the
state's
obligation,
under
that
child
support
program,
to
include
title
ii
benefits.
they
are
not
treated
as
that
under
the
state's
program.
and
if
you
look
at
title
iv-d,
under
section
651,
for
example,
where
it
talks
about
the
purposes
of
the
section
for
which
federal
funds
are
authorized,
it
refers
to
obtaining
child
support,
and
it
refers
to
payments
from
absent
parents.
and
similarly
in
section
652,
which
talks
about
the
requirements
of
state
plans,
it
talks
about
child
support
and
it
talks
about
obtaining
payments
from
absent
parents.
and
in
section
658,
which
provides
federal
incentive
payments
to
the
states
based
on
the
effectiveness
of
their
child
support
program,
it
has
never
been
the
case
that
a
state
would
receive
incentives
based
on
the
payment
of
these
title
ii
benefits.
instead,
the
state
receives
it
on
payments
collected
under
the
plan,
under
the
child
support
plan.
now,
congress
clearly
knew
the
difference
between
title
ii
benefits
and
child
support
payments
when
it
passed
this
disregard.
in
the
legislative
history
when
the
family
income
requirement
was
proposed
by
the
senate,
and
that
requirement
required
including
siblings
of
an
afdc
child
in
the
household
for
the
first
time
in
the
afdc
unit,
the
senate
report
explicitly
refers
to
social
security
or
child
support
as
the
types,
as
among
the
types
of
income
that
would
now
be
included
that
had
been
excluded
in
the
past.
and
in
the
family
income
requirement
itself,
it
talks
about
benefits
provided
under
title
ii.
in
contrast,
in
the
disregard
provision
the
language
explicitly
refers
to
child
support
payments.
and
so
congress
clearly
was
drawing
a
distinction
between
the
two,
at
least
in
its...
at
least
in
its
usage.
i
would
also
suggest
that
the
1988
amendment
is
particularly
helpful.
the
judgment
here
is
prospective,
and
so
the
1988
amendment
is
directly
relevant
to
the
judgment
under
review.
in
the
1988
amendment,
first,
the
text
of
the
provision
explicitly
refers
to
payments
by
the
absent
parent,
and
contains
no
indication
that
it
is
intended
to
refer
to
child
support
payments
of
any
other
kind.
now,
the
1988
amendment
is
helpful
not
only
in
terms
of
the
text
of
the
provision,
but
it
is
also
helpful
in
terms
of
the
purpose
of
the
provision,
because
there
has
been
a
discussion
as
to
whether
the
purpose
of
the
provision,
of
the
disregard
provision,
should
be
viewed
as
having
the
same
incentive
purpose
of
obtaining
payments
from
absent
parents
and
trying
to
get
families
off
of
afdc,
or
whether
it
should
be
viewed
as
having
a
purpose,
either
solely
or
principally,
of
mitigating
the
hardship
of
the
family
income
requirement
and
the
inclusion
of
siblings
who
had
previously
been
excluded.
now
what
the
amendment
does
in
1988
is
it
says
that
a
payment
will
only
get
a
disregard
if
it
is
paid
when
it
is
due
by
the
absent
parent,
if
it
is
paid
in
a
timely
fashion
by
the
absent
parent.
now
that,
the
operation
of
that,
the
credit
only
to
timely
payments,
doesn't
make
sense
if
the
purpose
of
the
provision
is
to
mitigate
the
hardship
of
the
family
income
requirement,
because
if
the
sibling
had
been
excluded
before
the
family
income
requirement
and
the
payments
came
late,
that
sibling
would
still
get
the
payments.
but
if
the
purpose
is
to
add
incentives
to
try
to
get
the
absent
parent
in
the
position
of
making
regular,
timely
payments,
then
the
timeliness
requirement
makes
perfect
sense.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
that
is.
and
again,
it
is
perfectly
consistent
with
this
problem
that
has
been
identified
since
1950
by
congress,
of
trying
somehow
to
get
absent
parents
to
fulfil
their
obligations.
now,
there
has
been
a
suggestion
that
it
is
unfair
to
exclude
title
ii
benefits
when
these
other
child
support
payments
are
getting
the
payment...
are
getting
the
disregard.
and
i
think
it's
important--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--these
child
support
payments.
[laughter]
yes.
and
when
these,
now
the
emphasis
is
on
ii
child's
insurance
benefits
are
somehow
arbitrarily
being
excluded.
it
is
a
relatively
small
percentage
of
people
on
afdc
who
get
any
disregard,
and
the
disregard
does
mitigate
hardship.
it
is
very
important
to
these
needy
families.
but
the
great
majority
of
families
on
afdc
don't
get
a
disregard,
and
they
don't
have
any
hope
of
developing
a
stream
of
outside
income
at
all.
i
mean,
the
question
really
is
do
people
who
are
getting
the
title
ii
benefits,
do
they
get
the
disregard
that
goes
to
people
when
their
parents
make
a
payment,
when
their
absent
parents
make
a
payment,
or
not.
and
in
that
situation
they
are
much
more
like
the
great
majority
of
people
who
are
on
afdc
who
do
not
get
the
disregard.
now,
there
is
another
point
which
respondents
have
raised
which
is
that
the
plain
meaning
of
the
term...
of
the
statute
is
inconsistent
with
the
view
that
the
payments
only
refer
to
payments
from
absent
parents,
because
the
statute
refers
to
any
child
support
payments,
including
those
passed-through
by
the
state
under
the
pass-through
provision.
and
respondents
contend
that
if
the
provision
only
refers
to
payments
from
absent
parents,
then
it
is
only
referring
to
those
passed-through
by
the
state
under
the
pass-through
provision,
and
it
is
not
giving
any
meaning
to
the
"any
child
support
payment"
part
of
the
provision.
and
that
simply
isn't
so.
as
early
as
1981
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
informed
congress
that
there
was
a
kind
of
payment
known
as
direct
support
payments
that
were
going
directly
to
the
family,
despite
the
assignment
of
child
support
rights
to
the
state.
and
the
secretary
has
issued
three
regulations
to
deal
with
the
treatment
of
those
direct
payments.
and
those
are
payments
that
are
not
passed-through
by
the
state
under
the
pass-through
provision.
so
it
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
plain
meaning
to
interpret
child
support
payments
as
referring
to
payments
from
absent
parents.
it
refers
to
any
child
support
payments,
including
those
passed-through
by
the
state.
now,
as
we
discussed,
the
secretary
within
weeks
of
the
defra
amendment
determined
that
payments
from
absent
parents
of
various
kinds
were
entitled
to
the
disregard.
and
the
secretary
at
that
time
noted
that
payments
that
were
passed-through,
direct
payments,
and
voluntary
payments
were
entitled
to
the
disregard.
now,
respondents
have
raised
a
number
of
objections
to
that
interpretation
as
being
unreasonable,
because
if
the
statute
is
susceptible
to
more
than
one
reading,
then
the
secretary's
interpretation
should
prevail.
one
of
the
objections
that
respondents
have
raised
is
to
the
spousal...
the
inclusion
of
spousal
support
payments,
the
point
that
justice
o'connor
raised.
we
have
discussed
that
the
secretary
applied
it
to
those
in
the
limited
circumstances
in
which
they
served
a
child
support
purpose.
respondents
have
also
objected
to
the
inclusion
of
voluntary
support
payments.
it
is
important
to
distinguish
between
voluntary
support
payments
and
direct
support
payments.
voluntary
support
payments
are
those
payments
that
are
made
in
the
absence
of
a
legal
order
to
do
so
by
the
court.
they
can
either
be
made
directly
to
the
family
and
be
a
direct
payment,
or
they
can
be
made
to
the
state
and
be
a
part
of
the
payment
that
goes
through
the
state
system.
now,
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
for
the
secretary
to
apply
the
disregard
to
voluntary
payments,
because
those
payments
are
from
absent
parents.
so
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
with
that.
it
is
consistent
with
the
secretary's
interpretation,
and
it
is
also
consistent
with
the
secretary's
general
interpretation
that
the
term
child
support
in
this
provision
should
be
construed
first
in
light
of
the
meaning
that
it
is
given
in
other
provisions
of
title
iv-a
and
title
iv-d,
which
he
is
charged
with
administering,
and
second
that
it
should
be
interpreted
in
light
of
the
long-standing
emphasis
in
the
afdc
program
and
the
problem
of
obtaining
payments
from
absent
parents.
now,
there
was
one
prior
instance
of
a
child
support
disregard,
and
that
was
in
1975
amendments
as
part
of
congress'
overhaul
of
the
afdc
system.
congress
did
a
number
of
very
significant
things
in
1975
with
respect
to
child
support.
first,
the
requirements
that
we
discussed
earlier
that
an
afdc
recipient
assign
rights
to
child
support
to
the
state
was
passed
in
1975.
second,
the
requirement
that
a
state
which
participates
in
the
afdc
program
have
a
child
support
program
was
passed
in
1975.
and
the
entire
creation
of
the
child
support
system
under
title
iv-d
was
passed
in
1975.
and
as
one
aspect
of
that
systematic
attempt
to
get
at
this
problem
of
payments
from
absent
parents,
congress
passed
for
a
15-month
period
a
child
support
pass-through
and
disregard
provision.
under
that
provision,
the
first
40
percent
of
the
first
$50
per
month
of
support
payments
collected
from
the
absent
parent
were
passed
through
to
the
family
on
whose
behalf
they
were
collected.
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision
makes
clear
that
the
purpose
of
that
pass-through
and
disregard
was
an
incentive
purpose.
it
was
an
incentive
for
the
non,
for
the
custodial
parent
to
cooperate
in
obtaining
child
support
payments
from
the
absent
parent,
and
it
was
an
incentive
also
to
ensure
that
the
family
would
always
be
better
off
if
the
absent
parent
made
a
payment.
the
secretary,
in
interpreting
the
disregard,
has
specifically
referred
to
this
prior
example
of
the
disregard,
and
just
as
it
was
reasonable
for
the
secretary
to
interpret
the
language
and
the
emphasis
in
terms
of
the
general
long-standing
emphasis,
it
was
also
reasonable
for
the
secretary
to
interpret
this
specific
device
in
light
of
the
history
of
the
only
prior
example
as
well.
once
again,
i
would
just
point
out
that
the
secretary
is
the
official
charged
by
congress
with
administering
the
title
iv-a
afdc
program,
the
title
iv-d
child
support
program,
and
the
title
ii
child's
insurance
benefits
program.
his
interpretation
that
child
support
payments
mean
payments
from
absent
parents,
not
social
security
benefits,
is
reasonable
and
is
consistent
with
the
statute,
and
should
be
upheld.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
just
a
few
brief
points,
your
honor.
first,
in
view
of
the
question
about
whether
the
term
child's
insurance
benefits
is
in
the
statute,
at
37a
and
38a
of
the
petition
you
will
see
that
the
term
is
in
the
statute.
second,
respondents
mentioned
that
there
would
be
an
incentive
rationale
with
title
ii
benefits
as
well,
in
terms
of
trying
to
get
somebody
to
apply
for
title
ii
benefits,
and
so
forth.
and
i
would
just
point
that,
unlike
the
problem
of
payments
from
absent
parents,
there
is
no
long-standing
emphasis
of
this
problem,
this
incentive
problem
in
the
afdc
program,
there
is
no
sustained
congressional
effort
to
get
at
that
problem.
and
third,
just
to
clarify
one
point
in
justice
stevens'
questions,
earned
income
does
get
its
own
disregard
in
many
circumstances.
it
can
be
lost
if
somebody
doesn't
comply
with
certain
requirements,
but
it
does
get
its
own
disregard.
however,
there
are
many
categories
of
unearned
income
that
do
not
get
any
disregard
at
all.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
you
find
social
security
payments
and
child
support
payments
being
identified,
including
in
1984,
by
the
senate
as
categories
of
income...
principal
categories
of
income,
that
they
do
want
to
include
that
had
been
excluded.
it's...
they
are
given
as
examples
of
those.
now...
and
it
is
true
that
the
senate
had
been
pushing
for
it,
the
house
had
been
resisting
it,
and
it
does
come
in
conference
without
any
explanation
of
the
disregard
provision.
now,
respondents
suggest
that
that
means,
because
it
came
as
part
of
this
compromise
in
conference,
it
must
have
a
mitigation
purpose.
there
is
no
conference
report
explanation
to
that
effect,
and
it
is
possible
to
hypothesize
other
reasons.
to
give
one
example,
it
might
be
that
the
house
thought
that
a
child
support
disregard
was
a
very
good
idea
because
of
the
incentive
purpose
and
so
on,
but
it
is
costly.
it
is
turning
out
to
be
very
costly
to
the
program.
and
so
it
could
only
get
into
the
program
as
part
of
horse
trading
when
they
were
also
doing
a
major
cost-saving
initiative
that
the
senate
had
wanted
to
do,
and
it
was
part
of
a
kind
of
legislative
compromise
that
comes
out
of
conferences
all
the
time.
whether
the
reason
for
that
compromise
was
the
reason
that
respondents
suggest,
or
this
reason,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
to--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that's
right.
that
is
my
point,
is
that
the
senate,
with
the
family
income
requirement,
was
going
to
be
saving
costs,
and
so
then
the
house
had
been
resisting
that,
and
so
it
is
perfectly
plausible
to
think
that
the
house
said
okay,
if
we
are
going
to
give
you
this
savings,
which
is
estimated
to
be
$455
million
over
the
next
few
years,
we
think
this
program
is
a
good
idea.
it
won't
eat
up
all
of
that,
and
here
is
a
way
to
fund
it
in
part.
and
so
you
won't
get
your
$455
million
savings,
but
you'll
still
get
savings,
and
we'll
further
this
worthy
purpose.
there
is
no
explanation
in
the
reports
one
way
or
the
other,
but
what
there
is
is
the
statutory
term
iv
and
had
a
particular
history
in
congress'
attention
to
that
problem.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
it
would,
justice
scalia,
and
it
would
if
it
was
acknowledged
by
one
of
the
parents
to
be
support
payments.
the
reason
for
that
is
because
the
secretary's
interpretation
has
been
tied
to
the
assignment
provision
in
402(a)(26),
which
requires
the
assignment
of
rights
to
support
from
other
persons.
the
legislative
history
in
1975
makes
it
clear
that
that
is
addressed
to
child
support.
the
secretary's
interpretation
really
focuses
on
child
support
as
that
which
can
be
assigned
the
right
to
support.
and
the
secretary
has
interpreted
when
somebody
goes
on
afdc
and
they
assign
any
rights
to
support
from
their
payment,
from...
excuse
me,
from
their
parent,
when
the
parent
then
makes
a
payment,
that
is
part
of
what
has
been
assigned
to
the
state.
and
actually
the
person,
the
recipient
is
under
an
obligation
to
turn
that
over
to
the
state
and
get
it
into
the
iv-d
system.
that's
where,
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
before,
about
there
are
two
kinds
of
payments
from
absent
parents.
there
is
direct
payments
and
there
are
those
that
go
to
the
state.
voluntary
payments
can
be
either
one,
and
if
they
are
direct
payments
then
they
should
either
be
returned
to
the
state
or
there
is
another
procedure
to
deal
with
it.
but
the
reason
that
the
secretary
has
treated
voluntary
payments
in
that
way
is
because
they
would
be
within
the
assignment
of
rights
to
the
state
under
602(a)(26).
thank
you.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
the
payments
from
that
trust
fund
would
not
get
the
disregard.
