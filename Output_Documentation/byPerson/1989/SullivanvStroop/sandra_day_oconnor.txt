--mr.
sloan,
what
does
the
secretary
do
if
the
payments
come
in
as
spousal
maintenance?
is
there
a
disregard
applied?
justice
o'connor
although
there
they
are
not,
strictly
speaking,
child
support
payments,
i
guess.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
that
is
the
argument
being
made
for
the
title
ii
benefit
payments.
justice
o'connor
do
any
of
the
secretary's
regulations
expressly
exclude
the
title
ii
payments?
