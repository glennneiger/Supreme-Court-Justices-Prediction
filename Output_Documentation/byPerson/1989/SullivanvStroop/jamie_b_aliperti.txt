mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
have
heard
how
the
secretary
wants
to
carefully
limit
the
application
of
the
disregard
and
narrowly
construe
its
meaning.
he
has
tried
very
hard
to
read
the
word
"any"
out
of
this
statute.
congress
intended
the
$50
disregard
provision
to
broadly
apply
to
any
child
support
payments.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
but
that
is
exactly
what
title
ii
benefits
are.
they
are
payments
for
the
support
of
one's
child.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
well,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that...
that
the
title
ii
parents
are
absent.
as
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
in
his
brief,
two
thirds
of
the
parents
of
these
children,
of
all
the
payments
that
are
made
under
title
ii,
are
from
deceased
parents.
i
would
submit
that
you
can't
get
much
more
absent
than
that.
[laughter]
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
well,
the
government
may
write
the
checks,
but
the
checks
are
drawn
from
wages
which
the
parents,
which
working
parents
have
paid
into
the
trust
fund.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
parent
paid
into
the
fund,
and
that
by
virtue
of
the
work
credits
and
the
payments
which
the
parent
had
made...
paid
into
the
fund,
the
amount
of
the
payments
that
is
made
to
the
child
is
calculated.
it
is
a
more
indirect
means
of
support
than
a
living
parent
sending
support
payments
to
their
child,
but
it's
child
support
nonetheless.
congress,
by
the
language
it
chose
to
enact,
wanted
all
forms
of
child
support
to
be
afforded
the
disregard.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
that
would
not
be
child
support,
your
honor.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
because
it
would
not--
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
--it
would
not
be
coming
from
the
parent.
i
think
that's
a
key
part
of
the
ordinary
understanding
of
child
support,
is
that
it
generate
from
the
parent.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
well,
your
honor,
that's
part
of
the
ordinary
understanding
of
the
term
child
support,
is
support
by
a
parent
to
support
one's
child.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
that's
what
it
says
in
the
random
house
dictionary,
your
honor.
it
is
money
paid
for
the
care
of
one's
minor
child,
and
that
is
exactly
what
title
ii
payments
are.
they
are
nothing
less
than
that.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
well,
whether
or
not
the
payment
comes
indirectly
through
title
ii
or
directly
through
payments
out
of
a
parent's
wages
does
not
lessen
the
support
character
of
the
title
ii
payment.
they
are
all
forms
of
child
support.
and
congress
made
it
clear
that
they
wanted
all
forms
of
child
support,
any
child
support
payments,
to--
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
--we're
saying
it
does
mean
any.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
we're
saying
that
congress
intended
the
disregard--
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
--it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
child
support--
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
--we're...
we
are
contending
that
the
parent
does
pay
it,
it
is
just
indirectly
through
the
insurance
fund.
and
we
would
also
contend
that,
that
under
the
broad
meaning
of
child
support,
which
congress
intended
when
it
enacted
this
statutory
language,
that
payments
of
that
type,
which
are
set
up
by
a
parent
to
pay
for
the
support
and
maintenance
of
a
child,
are
child
support.
this
court
has
always
recognized
the
support
character
of
title
ii.
it
has
no
other
purpose
but
to
support
children.
that
is
the
whole
purpose
in
which
the
program
was
first
set
up
in
1939.
and
in
50
years
of
legislative
history,
it
made
clear
that
congress'
intention
in
setting
up
these
funds
was
to
support
children.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
well,
under
the
secretary's
scenario,
yes,
it
would
be,
because
it
would
be
a
voluntary
payment.
the
secretary
would
allow
voluntary
payments
to
receive
the
disregard,
even
though
no
obligation
has
been
established,
even
if
paternity
hasn't
been
established.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
we
would
say
that
there
is
no
question
under
title
ii,
because
in
order
for
a
child
to
be
eligible
for
title
ii,
that
child
must
apply
for
the
benefits
and
show
that
he
was
dependent
upon
the
parent
at
the
time
the
parent
died,
became
disabled
or
retired.
and
the
dependency
tests
which
are
set
out
in
the
statute
all
hark
back
either
to
a
past
legal
obligation
or
to
an
obligation
which
could
have
been
confirmed
legally
and
was
observed
in
fact.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
there
is
some
discrimination
between
child
insurance
payments
and
other
forms
of
child
support,
both
in
the
social
security
act--
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
--voluntary
payments
aren't
referred
to
as
child
insurance
payments,
your
honor.
they
are
just
referred
to
as
voluntary
payments
by
the
secretary's
regulations.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
that
is
the
term
that's...
that's
used,
your
honor.
your
honor,
we
would
submit,
of
course
there
are
differences
between
title
ii
payments
and
other
forms
of
child
support.
an
apple
is
much
different
from
a
pear,
but
they
are
all
fruit.
and
when
you
talk
about
a
statute
in
which
a
disregard
applies
to
any
child
support
payments,
all
forms
of
child
support
were
intended
to
be
included
in
that.
also,
if
one
looks
at
the
legislative
history
of
the
sibling
deeming
enactment,
which
we
contend
that
the
congress
enacted
the
$50
disregard
for
the
purpose
of
mitigating
the
very
harsh
effects
of
sibling
deeming,
which
affected
adc
families
with
title
ii
children
every
bit
as
much
as
families
with
children
receiving
other
forms
of
child
support.
in
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
it
is
clear
that
congress
was
concerned
about
the
effects
of
sibling
deeming
on
two
specific
classes
of
payments:
social
security
title
ii
payments
and
child
support
paid
by
absent
parents.
and
the
language
which
congress
enacted,
that
the
disregard
applied
to
any
child
support
payments,
was
to
encompass
both
of
those
types
of
payments
that
they
were
most
concerned
about
in
enacting
sibling
deeming.
now,
$50
may
seem
like
an
insignificant
sum,
but
for
a
virginia
adc
family
of
three,
receiving
a
maximum
allotment
of
$265
a
month,
the
additional
$50
from
the
disregard
represents
a
20
percent
increase
in
monthly
income.
and
that
can
make
the
difference
between
a
parent
paying
or
not
paying
a
utility
bill,
or
being
able
to
buy
shoes
for
their
children
or
not.
the...
which
is
exactly
in
the
same
situation
as
adc
parents
whose
only
form
of
support
coming
in
is
payments
from
a
living,
absent
parent.
the
fourth
circuit,
in...
in
affirming
the
position
of
the
respondents,
noted
that
it
was
irrational
to...
to
apply
the
mitigating
benefits
of
the
disregard
statute
only
to
payments
from
living
absent
parents,
and
not
to
apply
that
to
title
ii
recipients
who
suffered
just
as
much.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
well,
that
is
what
the
government
is
saying
now,
your
honor.
that
is
not
what
the
government--
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
--we
contend
that
that
is
not
the
purpose
behind
the
statute.
in
the
gilliard
case--
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
--no,
your
honor,
because
an
incentive
rationale
could
also
apply
to
title
ii
payments.
title
ii
payments
do
not
fall
on
a
child
automatically.
the
child
must
apply
for
the
benefits.
the
child
must
qualify
under
the
dependency
test.
many
times
paternity
must
be
established
as
a
threshold
before
the
parent
can
apply
on
behalf
of
the
child
for
the
title
ii.
if
there
is
an
incentive
element
lurking
in
this
disregard,
it
would
also
encourage
parents
to
establish
paternity
and
to
establish
support
obligations
so
that
they
can
get
the
title
ii
benefits.
the
government
told
this
court
three
years
ago,
in
the
gilliard
case,
that
the
reason
for
the
enactment
of
the
disregard
was
to
mitigate
the
harmful
effects
of
sibling
deeming.
significantly,
that
case
didn't
even
involve
title
ii.
that
case
involved
payments
by
living
absent
parents,
yet
the
government
did
not
even
mention
this
incentive
argument.
only
after
the
disregard's
applicability
to
title
ii
became
an
issue
did
the
secretary
come
forward
with
this
incentive
rationale.
and
we
contend
it
is
simply
an
ad
hoc
response
to
litigation.
it
is
not
why
the
disregard
was
enacted
in
the
first
place.
and
if
one
looks
at
the
path
of
enactment
of
the
disregard,
and...
it
is
clear
that
it
was
enacted
as
a
compromise
so
that
sibling
deeming
could
pass.
it
was
defeated
in...
in
the
house
twice
before
it
was
finally
enacted
in
1984.
and
the
conference
report
in
1984
was
added
by
the
senate
a
third
time
as
an
amendment
to
the
defra
statute
which
had
been
passed
by
the
house.
and
the
conference
report
stated,
"the
conference
agreement
follows
the
senate
amendment
with
the
following
modification,
a
monthly
disregard
of
$50
of
child
support
received
by
the
family
is
established.
"
i...
the
sibling
deeming
provision
and
the
disregard
provision
are
chronologically
and
conceptually
linked.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
no,
your
honor.
the
language
that
i
just
quoted
to
the
court
is
the
only
language
that
talks
about
the
disregard
at
all.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
we
have
to
make
an
inference
based
on
the
path
of
enactment
of
the
two
statutes.
but
it's
a
strong...
we
contend
it's
a
strong
inference,
and
there
is
no
inference
that
can
be
drawn
whatsoever
from
the
path
of
enactment
that
incentive
was
the
rationale.
congress
has
addressed
the
question
of
incentive
in
other
legislation.
just
40
days
after
it
enacted
defra,
congress
enacted
the
child
support
act
amendments
in
which
a
large
number
of
provisions
relating
to
the
collection
of
child
support
were
enacted.
it's...
it--
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
--in
conference
reports
in
prior
years,
in
'82
and
'83,
when
the
sibling
deeming
was
passed
by
the
senate
but
defeated
by
the
house,
there
was
much
discussion
about
sibling
deeming
being
especially
harsh
on
social
security
recipients--
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
--these
title
ii
payments
and
child
support
by
living
non-custodial
parents.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
yes,
your
honor.
it
would
appear
from
a
fair
reading
of
the
legislative
history
that
those
were
the
two
groups
that
congress
was
most
concerned
about,
and
why
sibling
deeming
did
not
pass
the
house
in
'82
and
'83.
and
then
there
were
no...
there
was
no
mention
of
the
disregard
in
any
prior
bill
before
congress.
it
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
the
'84
house-senate
conference
committee.
and
it
is
clear
that
it
was
a
compromise
in
order
to
get
sibling
deeming
passed.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
they
were
referring
specifically
to
the
child
dependent
payments,
payments
for
dependent
children.
and
by
the
language
of
the
enactment,
any
child
support
payments...
congress
wasn't
looking
to
disregard
any
other
kind
of
payments.
certainly
congress
wasn't
intending,
from
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
to
apply
disregard
to
spousal
support
payments,
which
the
secretary
does.
we
contend
that
it
is
highly
irrational
to
deny
the
disregard
to
a
payment
that
clearly
has
as
its
only
purpose
the
support
of
children,
and
then
apply
the
disregard
to
spousal
support
payments,
which
are
not
meant
to
support
children
at
all.
they
are
meant
to
support
the
spouse.
and
the
secretary
misstates
when
he
contends
that
the,
that
spousal
support
is
granted
the
disregard
only
if
it
is
inseparable
from
child
support.
in
practice,
if
spousal
support
payments
are
received,
and
no
child
support
payments
are
received,
even
if
they
are
clearly
differentiated,
that
spousal
support
payment
will
be
granted
the
disregard.
and
that
clearly
is
not
what
the
statute
plainly
says.
and
it
certainly
doesn't
comport
with
a
professed
narrow
reading
of
the
statute.
this
court
has
always
interpreted
the
word
"any"
to
signal
that
a
broad
construction
of...
of
a
provision
was
intended.
as
this
court
noted
in
the
united
states
v.
james,
given
the
broad
sweep
of
such
language,
it
requires
some
ingenuity
to
create
ambiguity.
yet,
as
shown
by
the
georgia
department
of
social
services'
administrative
decision
which
the
secretary
lodged
along
with
his
brief,
he
excludes
title
ii
by
a
professed
narrow
reading
of
the
statute.
now
i
would
like
to
quote
one
sentence
out
of
that
administrative
decision,
because
i
think
it
gets
to
the
nub
of
the
problem.
it
says
that
while
these
benefits
might
be
viewed
generally
as
child
support,
the
family
support
administration
reasonably
determined
that
they
did
not
fall
within
the
narrower
concept
of
the
act.
one
thing
is,
we
contend,
is
quite
clear.
and
that
is
that
congress
intended
a
broad
interpretation
of
this
statute.
they
could
not
have
used
clearer
language
for
that.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
well,
congress
could
have
said--
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
--congress
could
have
said
we
intend
this
to
apply
to
social
security
benefits
as
well
as
other
forms
of
child
support.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
but
they
said
any
child
support
payments.
the
secretary's
interpretation
can
only
be
found
to
be
plausible
and
reasonable
if
this
court
determines
that
title
ii
payments
are
not
payments
to
support
children
at
all.
and
that
runs
counter
to
the
entire
50-year
history
of
the
disregard,
of
the
title
ii
statutory
scheme,
and
what
this
court
has
said
on
numerous
occasions
in
prior
cases.
whether
or
not
the
payment
came
from
a
deceased
parent
or
from
a
retired
parent
or
from
a
disabled
parent,
in
all
three
of
those
instances
this
court
has
always
recognized
the
support
character
of
those
payments.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
the
reason
for
that,
your
honor,
is
that
we
contend
that
the
ordinary
meaning
of
child
support
does
not
include
payments
by
someone
other
than
the
parent
of
the
child,
not
from
an
uncle
or
from
a
friend
or
some
other
relative.
and
it--
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
--it
includes
insurance
payments
because
we
contend,
your
honor,
that
that
is
emanating
from
the
parent.
the
parent
either
set
up
the
insurance
fund
or
the
parent
paid
their
wages
into
the
fund.
the
government
has
made,
has
stated
on
numerous
occasions
in...
in
its
brief
that
the
government
is
paying
these
benefits,
but
the
government
is
not
paying
these
benefits.
the
central
feature
of
title
ii
is
that
the
parent
pays
into
the
trust
fund,
and
that
is
a
condition
precedent
for
the
payments
to
go
out
to
the
children.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
all
it
is
is
one
step
removed.
the
ordinary
meaning
doesn't
focus
on
the
source
of
the
payment,
your
honor.
the
ordinary
meaning
focuses
on
the
function
of
the
payment
and
its
purpose.
and
the
only
purpose
of
the
title
ii
payments
is
to
provide
support
to
children.
it
has
no
other
purpose.
there
is
no
secondary
purpose
or
secondary
function.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
the
source
being
the
parent,
again
the
payment
wouldn't
exist
if
the
parent
hadn't
been
making
payments
into
the
trust
fund,
and
if
that
child
had
not
been
dependent
upon
that
parent
at
the
time
that
the
parent
either
became
deceased
or
retired
or
disabled.
if
those
two
conditions
don't
exist,
that
child
does
not
qualify
for
title
ii.
mr.
jamie
b.
aliperti
yes,
your
honor,
and
we
can
only
speculate
as
to
why
congress
chose
to
apply
the
disregard
to
child
support
payments
rather
than
to
simply
any
income
of
the
child.
again,
the
legislative
history
does
show
that
there
were
two
specific
kinds
of
payments
that
congress
was
most
concerned
about.
also,
it
would
have
been
an
administrative
nightmare,
i
believe,
if
department
of
health
and
human
services
had
been
required
to
figure
out
which
families
had
previously
excluded
children
from
the
adc
assistance
unit,
and
were
therefore
affected
by
sibling
deeming
and
should
receive
the
benefits
of
the
disregard.
many
families
excluded
children
and
then
added
them
back,
and
then
excluded
them
again,
depending
upon
who
had
income
coming
in
at
the
time.
it
was
just
a
lot
easier
to
apply
a
blanket
disregard
to
any
child
support
payments,
which
would
encompass
the
two
groups
that
congress
was
most
concerned
about.
now,
again,
the
secretary,
in
his
1987
brief
in
the
gilliard
case,
offered
as
the
reason
for
the
disregard's
enactment
one
reason:
mitigation.
and
it
is
only
after
a
challenge
to
that
came
up
that
he
began
talking
about
incentives.
also,
the
secretary
refers
to
other
references
to
the
term
child
support
in
other
sections
of
the
social
security
act.
in
each
case
he
takes
that
term
out
of
context.
many
times
the
reference
is
neutral;
it
doesn't
give
us
any
insight
as
to
what
they
are
referring
to.
and
the
other
times,
when
it
is
referring
to
payments...
specific
payments
from
living,
absent
parents,
it
is
in
the
context
of
the
iv-d
system.
and
clearly,
if
you
are
talking
about
iv-d
payments,
you
can
only
be
talking
about
living,
absent
parent
payments,
because
that
is
the
only
kind
of
payments
that
can
be
funneled
through
the
iv-d
system.
again,
in
our
own
complaint
in
district
court,
we
offered...
we
differentiated
between
social
security
title
ii
payments
and
other
forms
of
child
support.
but
that
was
in
the
context
of
talking
about
the
effects
of
sibling
deeming,
and
it
would
be
natural
to
differentiate
in
that
regard.
congress
did
not
create
classes
of
child
support,
some
of
which
would
get
the
mitigating
effects
of
the
disregard
and
others
which
would
not.
all
child
support
payments,
any
child
support
payments
are
entitled
to
the
disregard
under
the
language
which
congress
itself
chose
to
enact.
and
we
contend
that
the
language
means
what
it
says,
that
if
there
is
a
payment
for
the
support
of
children,
coming
from
a
parent,
whatever
the
nature
of
that
payment,
that
payment
is
entitled
to
the
disregard.
i
would
want
to
close
by
talking
briefly
about
how
sibling
deeming
operates
vis-a-vis
the
disregard,
and
the
best
example
for
that
is
the
family
of
geneva
powers,
which
is
one
of
the
named
plaintiffs.
ms.
powers
had
a
family
of
four.
she
was
receiving
ssi
payments
of
$336
a
month
for
panic
attacks.
she
in
addition
was
receiving
$207
a
month
in
adc
for
her
daughters
nancy
and
loretta
powers,
who
she
had
by
her
ex-husband
roy
powers.
and
for
her
third
child,
crystal
mcclanahan,
who
was
by
her
deceased
husband
ralph
mcclanahan,
she
was
receiving
$254
a
month
in
title
ii.
now,
after
sibling
deeming
went
into
effect,
the...
and
crystal
mcclanahan
was
forced
into
the
assistance
unit,
the
$207
adc
check
was
reduced
to
$11.
now,
if
that
$254
check
had
been
from
a
living
ralph
mcclanahan
who
was
making
payments
pursuant
to
a
court
order,
the
powers
family
would
have
received
an
additional
$50
a
month
to
work
with.
but
simply
because
mr.
mcclanahan
was
deceased
and
the
payments
were
coming
through
title
ii,
even
though
the
function
and
the
purpose
of
the
payments
were
not
merely
similar
in
the
two
situations,
they
are
absolutely
identical,
but
no
disregard
for
ms.
powers.
we
contend
that
that
is
contrary
to
the
plain
language
that
congress
chose
to
enact.
it
is
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
the
disregard
statute.
and
it
is
contrary
to
50
years
of
legislative
history
and
opinions
of
this
court
construing
what
is
the
nature
of
title
ii.
thank
you,
your
honor.
