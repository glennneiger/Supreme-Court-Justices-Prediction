justice
stevens
is
there
any,
mr.
aliperti,
is
there
any
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
in
connection
with
the
conference
report
of
the
fact,
the
specific
fact
that
the
sibling
deeming
provision
would
encompass
children
who
were
receiving
social
security
benefits?
justice
stevens
it
is
really
subject
to--
justice
stevens
--what
i
am
wondering
is,
is
it
possible,
is
it
consistent
with
your
understanding
of
the
legislative
history
that
congress
just
didn't
really
think
about
this
problem?
and
i
don't
know
which
way
that
cuts,
but
that
they
thought...
of
course
the
inevitable
consequence
of
the
statute
was
that
it
would
require
inclusion
of
the
sibling
who
was
getting
social
security
benefits,
but
did
anybody
talk
about
that
being
one
of
the
things
that
would
happen
under
this
amendment?
justice
stevens
oh,
there
was.
justice
stevens
so
your
argument
is
that
that
indicates
that
the
opposition
in
'84
was
partially
based
on
the
effect
on
families
that
would
the
social
security...
have
social
security
beneficiaries
in
them.
justice
stevens
are
there
any
other
kinds
of
social
security
payments,
other
than
those
that
can
be
characterized
perhaps
as
child
support,
that
would
also
have
been
covered
by
their
concern?
justice
stevens
well,
they
could
have
used
clearer
language.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
they
could
have
said
including
social
security
benefits.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
let
me,
may
i
just
ask
this.
to
the
extent
that
you
rely
on
the
legislative
compromise
and
the
legislative
history
in
1984,
wouldn't
the
purpose
of
mitigating
the
hardship
of
the,
of
including
the
income
of
the
sibling
and
making
him
join
the
family
group
also
apply
to
people
who
are
receiving
money
from
a
grandparent
or
people...
children...
or
even
children
who
are
working
at
some
job
where
they
earn
a
few
dollars
a
week,
or
something
like
that?
wouldn't
the
purpose
still
apply
to
that
whole
category?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
mr.
sloan,
about
his
argument
that
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
from
'82
through
'84,
that
you
find
in
'82
and
'83
there
was
concern
about
the
sibling
deeming
program's
effect
on
title
ii
recipients
as
well
as
support
payments,
and
therefore
if
you
read
the
whole
legislative
history
as
a
package,
it
is
fair
to
assume
this
mitigation
purpose
motivated
his
clients
as
well
as
the
support
people.
what
do
you
say
about
that
argument?
justice
stevens
of
course,
the
disregard
would
add
costs
to
the
program.
