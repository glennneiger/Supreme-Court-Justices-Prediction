the
statute
does
say
any
child
support
payments.
justice
white
and
these
are
payments
to
a
child
or
for
the
child's
benefit.
justice
white
so,
what
do
you
do?
you
say
child
support
is
a
term
of
art,
or--
justice
white
where
are
these...
where
are
these
payments...
particular
payments
identified
as
child
insurance
payments?
justice
white
and
what
does
it
say?
does
it,
is
it
just
a
heading,
or
what?
justice
white
thanks
a
lot.
but
it's
also
in
the
text,
is
it
not?
i
think
you'll
find
that
it
is.
justice
white
these
other...
these
other
child
support
payments?
justice
white
xxx
it
seems
to
me,
then,
that
you
have
to
really
meet
the
argument
that
we
should
defer
to
the
secretary's
construction.
because
if
you
say
it
really
doesn't
mean
any--
justice
white
--well--
justice
white
--but
you
have
to
define
child
support
in
order
to
say
it
means
any.
justice
white
and
i
would
think
if
you
say
it
has
to
be
coming
from
a
parent,
i
would
think
that
would
be
proper,
or
at
least
within
the
ballpark
to
say
well,
that
really
means
child
support
from
a
parent
who
is
paying
it,
right
now,
that
writes
the
checks.
justice
white
suppose
a...
suppose
an
insured
divorced
person
during
his
lifetime
makes
payments
pursuant
to
a
court
order,
but
he
has
set
up
a
trust
fund,
and
he
has
gotten
rid
of
it
entirely.
and
he
says
upon
my
death,
pay
x
dollars
a
month
to
my
children.
justice
white
right.
