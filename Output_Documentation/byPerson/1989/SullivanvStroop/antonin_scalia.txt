justice
scalia
--mr.
sloan,
essentially
your
response
to
justice
white's
question,
the
statute
does
say
any
child
support
payments,
and
your
response
is
yes,
it
says
any
child
support
payments.
i
mean,
that's
really
the
argument
that
is
going
on,
isn't
it?
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--so
you
either
italicize
the
"any"
or
you
italicize
the
"child
support
payments"--
justice
scalia
timeliness
requirement
in
the
'88
amendments?
justice
scalia
that
also?
justice
scalia
but
if...
what
if
an
aunt
of
one
of
the
families
that
is
on
afdc
gives,
gives
some
money
to
the
mother
and
says
this...
this
is
to
support
your
child.
justice
scalia
why
not?
justice
scalia
your
definition
is
anything
that
supports
the
child.
justice
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
either
appealing
to
ordinary
understanding,
in
which
case
i
think
the
chief
justice's
description
is...
is
what
the
ordinary
understanding
is,
or
you're
appealing
to
the
literal
meaning
of
child
support,
in
which
case
your
answer
to
my
question
would
be...
would
be
the
opposite.
but
you're
trying
to
straddle
the
two,
you're
saying
it
isn't
really
ordinary
understanding,
but
on
the
other
hand
we
don't
mean
child
support
means
any
child
support,
not
really.
it's
only
child
support
coming
from
the
parent.
justice
scalia
if
you're
appealing
to
ordinary
understanding,
i
think
it
means--
justice
scalia
suppose
i
am
a
parent
that
has
no
legal
obligation
to
support
the
child;
there
has
been
a
divorce
and
the
wife
hasn't
gotten
any
child
support
payment
as
part
of
the
decree.
and
the
family
falls
on
hard
times
and
i
give
the
wife
some
money,
and
i
say
this
is
for
the
support
of
my
minor
child.
would
that
be
a
child
support
payment?
justice
scalia
what
about
you?
justice
scalia
but
you
yourself
don't...
don't
argue
that
any
payment
to
support
children
is
a
child
support
payment.
i
mean,
you
give
some
ordinary
meaning
to
it.
you
are
willing
to
acknowledge
that
the
payment
has
to
come
from
a
parent,
but
i...
why
not
go
all
the
way
and
say
that,
as
the
secretary
does,
and
say
that
we
usually
mean
by
a
child
support
payment
is...
is
a
payment
that
is
imposed
on
the
parent,
a
legal
obligation.
justice

xxx
include
insurance
payments,
the
ordinary
meaning?
justice
scalia
that
may
be,
but
i
still
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
the
ordinary
meaning
of
child
support
payment
is
a
payment
from
an
insurance
company.
and
that's...
that's
the
argument
that
you
are
making,
right?
that
that's
the
ordinary
meaning.
justice
scalia
mr.
sloan,
why
does
the
government...
why
does
the
government
include
voluntary
payments,
which
i
would
not
normally
consider
child
support
payments.
i
mean,
if
i
am
divorced
and
i
am
visiting
and
i
say,
you
know,
here
is
some
money
for
the
kid,
that
would
be...
that
would
come
under
the
exclusion?
