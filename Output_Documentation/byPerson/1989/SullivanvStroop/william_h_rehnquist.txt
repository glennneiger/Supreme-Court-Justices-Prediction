we'll
hear
argument
now
in
louis
w.
sullivan
v.
elizabeth
stroop.
mr.
sloan.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sloan.
mr.
aliperti.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
aliperti,
as
one
who
practiced
law
for
16
years
and
practiced
some
domestic
relations
law,
child
support
payments,
to
me,
speaking
only
for
myself,
is
almost
a
word
of
art.
it
means
the
payment
coming
from
an
absent
parent
for
the
support...
it
is
used
for
the
support
of
a
child.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it's
not
coming
from
an
absent
parent,
it's
coming
from
an
insurance
program.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
government
is
paying--
--the
government
is
paying.
the
government
writes
the
checks.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
the
same
as
if
you
had
a
private
insurance
policy.
you
could
say
in
a
very
theoretical
sense
that
the
insurance
company's
benefits
are
drawn
from
the
premiums
that
were
paid
it,
but
it's
not
true
in
any
literal
sense.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--certainly
the
intonation
from
that
definition
is
that
it
is
paid
by
the
person
who
is
responsible
for
the
minor
child.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
about
the
government's
argument
that
the
reason
for
the
distinction
is
to
encourage
the
absent
living
parents
to
keep
making
the
payments?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
about
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
if
it
were
the
purpose
behind
the
statute?
would
you
then
feel
it
satisfied
the
rational
basis
test?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
ordinary
meaning
certainly
does
focus
on
the
source,
i
think,
the
source
being
the
parent.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
aliperti.
mr.
sloan,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sloan.
the
case
is
submitted.
