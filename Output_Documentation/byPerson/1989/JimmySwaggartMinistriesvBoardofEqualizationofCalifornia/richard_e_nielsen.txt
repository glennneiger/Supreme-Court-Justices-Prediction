mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
i
start
addressing
points
i
would
like
to
make
today,
i
want
to
clarify
a
few
points
made
by
mr.
mcconnell.
the
record
does
show
that
the
items
taxed
in
these
matters
involve
a
quid
pro
quo.
on
page
178
of
the
joint
appendix...
171
on
the
joint
appendix,
their
witness
testified
that,
with
respect
to
donations
and
money
sent
in,
that
only
in
the
instance
when
money
was
sent
in
and
could
be
identified
to
a
book
or
a
tape
or
some
tangible
personal
property--
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
--starting
with
the
question
about
the
middle
of
the
page,
where
it
says
if
they
ask
for
the
item
and
you
know
the
price
of
the
item,
could
you
break
that
out.
the
response
was
if
they
use
the
order
form,
those
that
use
the
order
form
we
could.
so
the
evidence
is
that,
with
respect
to
their
internal
records,
they
have
segregated
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
from
donations.
the
next
question
was,
and
those
that
did
not
use
the
order
form,
what
was
the
procedure.
the
response
is,
the
procedure
that
the
organization
followed
was
that
it
was
charged
to
a
donation.
so
in
the
situation
where
they
were
not
clear
as
to
what
amount
was
being
given
for
tangible
personal
property,
they
charge
it
to
donation.
the
evidence
in
the
case
is
that
when
they
arrived
at
the
taxable
amounts
in
this
case,
they
only
went
to
the
items
that
were
directly
set
up
on
their
books
as
sales.
so
there
is
no
question
here
that
we
are
going
after
any
donations,
there
is
no--
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
--that
is
correct,
it's
a
matter
of
the
intent
of
the
parties,
your
honor.
in
this
case
there
were
advertisements,
there
were
order
forms.
the
order
forms
provided
that
if
you
wanted
three
tapes
for
$7,
you
sent
in
the
$7.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
that
was
another
point,
your
honor.
the
first
point
was
he,
there
was
a
question
about
quid
pro
quo,
and
he
said
there
necessarily
wasn't
any
evidence
of
that.
and
i
was
trying
to
point
out
there
was.
the
second
point,
there
was
a
question
as
to
whether
what
they
were
selling
exceeded
the
cost.
and
with
respect
to
that,
on
page
203
of
the
joint
appendix,
with
respect
to
the
answers
to
interrogatories
number
15,
they
indicated
the
factors
considered
in
determining
the
price,
number
9,
are
the
cost
of
the
item
and
the
prices
of
similar
items
in
the
marketplace.
they
also,
further
down
below,
said
amounts
given
away
were
never
significant.
over
on
page
204
near
the
bottom,
under--
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
--well,
i'm
following
in
on
page
204,
your
honor,
on
the
bottom
of
number
12,
it
says
with
respect
to
other
items,
that
prices...
the
last
phrase
is
prices
were
not
reduced
below
cost.
it
is
correct,
and
i
believe
there
is
other
testimony
that
i
can't
point
to
right
off
hand,
that
they
basically
said
the
tapes
usually
sold
for
$7
or
$8,
and
they
only
cost
about
$1
to
produce.
so,
i
think
the
record
indicates
there
is
a
profit.
but
that
is
not
the
key
in
this
case.
the
sales
tax
is
not
determinative
on
whether
a
profit
is
or
is
not
made.
sales
tax
applies
when
there
is
a
transfer
of
tangible
personal
property
for
a
consideration.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
that
is...
that
is
an
interesting
question,
because
i
believe
it
came
up
in
another
case
recently.
the
answer
to
that
is
it
depends
on
whether
there
is
a
transfer
of
tangible
personal
property
for
sale.
you've
got
to
look
at
the
definition
of
sale.
if
you
get
possession
of
that
candle,
then
that
would
be
a
taxable
sale.
but
generally,
i
think
the
example
you
are--
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
--i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
they
are
not.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
i
think
so.
california,
in
its
1946
watchtower
decision,
the
california
supreme
court
upheld
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
on
items
similar
to
those
in
question
here.
so,
i
believe
as
long
as
there
is
not
a
constitutional,
unconstitutional
burden,
such
as
a
flat
tax
or
differential
taxation
or
discrimination,
if
it
is
a
general
tax
that
applies
to
all
property
in
the
state
alike,
i
believe
it
could.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
i
personally
do
not.
the
board
of
equalization--
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
--the
candle
situation,
your
honor,
i
believe,
in
order
to
follow
up
on
the
other
question,
is
generally
in
that
situation.
you
go
in
and
you
put
the
money
into
the
receptacle
and
you
light
a
candle.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
there
is
no
transfer
of
property.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
--that
is
not
tangible
personal
property.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
no.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
no.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
because
you
are
not...
you
are
not
getting
possession
or
buying
property.
you
are
occupying
a
space.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
yes,
i
believe
an
occupancy
tax--
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
--a
general
occupancy
tax,
that
would
be
broad
enough
to
encompass
any
type
of
activity,
yes.
if
it
is
just
attending
a
religious
service--
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
--the
legislature
in
states
have
many
mean
of
raising
taxes,
and
i
believe
that
is
why
it
is
very
critical
in
this
case
that
you
have
to
look
that
this
is
a
general,
non-discriminatory
revenue-raising
tax.
it
is
broadly
based,
and
if
you
start
carving
out
exceptions,
you
are
basically,
you're
going
to
have
to
force
the
legislature
to
raise
the
rate
or
to
think
of
other
taxes.
the
question
presented--
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
--the
question
presented
is
whether
the
imposition
of
the
california
sales
tax
and
the
responsibility
to
collect
the
use
tax
on
a
religious
organization
concerning
its
sales
of
religious
materials
violates
the
first
amendment
free
exercise
rights.
california
sales
and
use
taxes
are
generally
applicable,
non-discriminatory
taxes,
imposed
when
there
is
a
sale
and
use
of
tangible
personal
property
in
the
state.
as
i
previously
pointed
out,
the
board
of
equalization
has
consistently
held
since
the
1930s,
when
the
sales
and
use
tax
was
enacted,
that
sale
of
tangible
personal
property
by
religious
organizations
are
not
immune
from
tax.
california
sales
and
use
taxes
place
no
prior
restraint
on
swaggart's
practice
of
religion,
nor
do
the
taxes
conflict
with
any
asserted
religious
belief
of
mr....
of
swaggart.
the
taxes
are
of
general
application
and
are
not
a
special
tax
on
religion.
swaggart
is
asking
this
court
to
do
what
it
has
held
state
legislatures
cannot
do,
create
an
exemption
based
solely
on
religious
grounds.
there
is
no--
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
--i
think
that
is
an
improper
distinction,
because
i
think
what
they
are
comparing
is
basically
apples
and
oranges.
what
they
are
saying
is
if
you
can't
give
a
subsidy
of
cash
or,
as
texas
monthly
held,
an
exemption,
therefore
you
can't
tax
them.
i
would
agree
to
the
extent
if
you
can't
have
a
special--
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
--if
you
can't
have
a
special
exemption,
you
also
cannot
have
a
special
tax
aimed
selectively
at
a
religion,
just
like
in
minneapolis
star
and
the
other
cases
where
you
have
differential
taxation
or
selective
taxation,
that
follows.
but,
if
you
have...
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that
if
you
have
a
general
exemption
for,
let's
say,
books,
and
if
there
are
religious
books,
that
that
would
not
violate
anything.
and
on
the
other
side,
if
you
have
a
general
tax,
which
is
what
we're
saying,
if
you
have
a
general
tax
that
applies
to
all
tangible
personal
property
in
the
state,
then
there
is
no
unconstitutional
problem
with
that.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
that
is
similar
to
distribution
of
books
to
schools
and
so
forth.
yes,
that
is
correct.
there
is
no
burden
on
california
to
demonstrate
that
its
sales
and
use
taxes
on
religious
materials
are
the
least
restrictive
means
of
achieving
a
compelling
state
interest.
swaggart
wants
this
court
to
extend
its
compelling
state
interest
test
to
situations
not
involving
coercion
or
prohibition
of
religious
beliefs
or
practices.
swaggart
urges
application
of
the
test
to
situations
involving
any
government
burden
rather
than
unconstitutional
burdens.
this
court
in
lyng,
and
most
recently
in
frazee,
held
that
the
compelling
state
interest
test
is
applicable
when
individuals
would
be
coerced
or
penalized
by
government
action
into
violating
their
religious
belief.
no
such
coercion
or
penalty
flows
from
the
application
of
the
california
sales
and
use
tax.
this
court
observed
in
lee
that
not
all
burdens
on
religion
are
unconstitutional,
and
in
murdock
that
religious
groups
are
not
free
from
all
financial
burdens
of
government.
recently
in
lyng
this
court
observed
that
only
government
action
that
prohibits
one
from
free
exercise
of
his
or
her
religion
is
subject
to
the
compelling
state
interest
test.
the
board
submits
that
the
california
sales
and
use
tax
does
not
prohibit
the
practice
of
religion.
the
taxes
in
question
are
not
fixed
in
amount,
but
are
related
to
the
realized
revenues;
they
are
minimal...
6
percent,
and
they
are
payable
after
the
sale
occurs.
there
is
no
cumulative
effect
of
the
taxes,
and
it
can
be
passed
on
to
the
seller.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
your
honor,
i
believe
the
court
has
addressed
that
in
minneapolis
star
and
in
some
other
cases
where
it
held
that
absent
differential
or
discriminatory
taxation,
the
concern...
the...
of
crippling
an
organization
is
addressed
basically
through
the
political
process.
i
believe,
if
you...
that
the
rate
in
and
of
itself,
although
high,
would
not
be
a
defect.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
there
is
not
only
no
evidence
in
the
record
about
that,
there
is
also
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
swaggart,
the
organization,
was
affected
in
how...
in
distributing...
except
for
the
argument
that
if
you
have
less
funds
you
can't
do
as
much
as
you
would
normally
do.
but
in
this
case
the
tax
can
be
passed
on.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
that's
with
respect
to
the
individual.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
i
believe
it
follows
that
obviously
when
you
make
a
decision,
anybody
who
makes
a
decision
to
buy
something
looks
at
the
price.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
yes.
on
that
point,
the
incidental
economic
impact
of
the
tax
may
make
it
more
costly
for
one
to
practice
his
or
her
religion,
but
it
has
no
tendency
to
coerce
swaggart
into
acting
contrary
to
any
asserted
religious
belief.
swaggart
below
challenged
the
taxes
on
the
basis
that
the
burden
caused
by
having
less
funds
available
after
paying
the
tax
unconstitutionally
burden
its
right
to
spread
the
gospel.
now
it
has
apparently
abandoned
this
ground,
and
even
concedes
that
taxes
on
alleged
secular
transactions
are
lawful,
even
if
they
result
in
less
funds.
also,
swaggart
recognized
that
it
does
not
have
to
absorb
the
taxes
in
question,
as
they
can
be
passed
on
to
the
buyer.
administrative
burden
has
now
been
emphasized
by
swaggart
as
the
unconstitutional
burden.
but
again
swaggart
fails
to
realize
that
said
burden
is
not
unconstitutional,
or
every
religious
organization's
compliance
with
the
government
regulation
or
tax
would
be
deemed
an
unconstitutional
heavy
burden.
such
compliance
is
deemed
a
substantial
burden
in
california's
broad
public
interest
in
having
a
uniform
and
comprehensive
general
revenue-raising
tax,
with
as
broad
a
base
as
possible,
would
constitute
a
compelling
state
interest.
california
sales
and
use
taxes
account
for
over
30
percent
of
the
state
revenue.
accommodation
of
religion
in
this
system
would
unduly
interfere
with
the
high
government
interest
as
a
myriad
of
forced
exceptions
would
compromise
the
system.
swaggart's
primary--
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
--well,
i
think
the
analogy
in
this
case
is
that
made
in
lee,
that
it
is
not...
the
impact
of
having
to
create
forced
exemptions,
whether
it
is
for
this
basis
or
for
other
basis,
will
hinder
the
system.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
well,
in
other
states
that
is
possibly
true,
but
in
california
it
has
held
since
1930
that
sales
of
all
tangible
personal
property,
except
those
carved
out
specifically
by
the
legislature,
are
taxable.
and
i
think
that
is
the
point
this
court
has
emphasized
in
dealing
with
states.
that
it
doesn't
want
to
start
getting
into
the
province
of
what
state
legislatures
should
or
should
not
do.
and
the
other
side
of
the
coin
is--
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
--that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
they
are
not
we...
california
makes
the
best
compliance
effort
as
possible
to
go
out
and
audit...
it
is
a
self-assessed
tax.
we
don't
have
an
auditor
to
go
out
and
look
at
every
taxpayer
to
see
that
something
is
being
done.
we
have
no...
we
have
rulings
that
have
held
that
transfers
of
tangible
personal
property,
which
would
include
that,
are
taxable.
and
absent
a
specific
case,
i
can
represent
that
i
am
not
aware
of
a
specific
case
where
that
has
come
up.
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
with
respect
to
that
specific
example,
from
my
own
personal
information,
being
a
roman
catholic,
is
usually
what
is
said
in
the
vestibule
of
the
church
is
the
literature
is
there
for
the
taking,
whether
you
leave
something
or
not.
and
in
a
situation
like
that,
where
the
intent,
again
getting
back
to
your
question
regarding
isn't
it
the
intent
of
the
parties
that
sort
of
determine
a
quid
pro
quo
and
so
forth,
the
same
thing
here.
the
intent
of
the
church
in
that
situation
is
to
let
someone
come
in
and
freely
take
that
pamphlet
or
brochure,
whatever,
irrespective
of
whether
there
is
a
transfer
of
money
or
not.
in
that
situation,
most
likely,
it
is
not
a
sale.
the
church
is
probably
a
consumer
of
that
property
and
swaggart
has
concede
that
when
you
buy
property
that
you
should
pay
tax
on
it
to
the
wine
maker,
or
to
whatever.
so
in
the
situation
i
think
you
are
referring
to,
your
honor,
is
that
it
is
probably
not
sale.
swaggart's
primary
administrative
burden
arguments
relate
to
determining
what
price
items
are
sold
for,
and
complying
with
a
potential
7,000
jurisdictions.
both
arguments
are
overstated
and
contradicted
by
the
evidence
in
the
record.
taking
the
last
point
first,
california
and
baton
rouge
are
the
only
ones
taking
swaggart's
sales.
so
this
risk
is
minimal.
and
if
it
ever
developed,
there
is
evidence
that
swaggart's
computer
system
could
be
programmed
to
handle
it.
swaggart's
other
concern
regarding
donations
versus
sales
is
likewise
overstated.
swaggart
was
able
to
ascertain
sales
amounts
for
the
period
in
question,
and
even
though
his
records
were
not
set
up
for
said
purpose.
certainly
for
the
future
the
evidence
indicates
that
swaggart
can
design
an
adequate
system
to
comply
for
reporting
purposes.
he
can
design
forms.
organizations
deal
with
this
problem
for
internal
revenue
service
purposes,
as
recognized
in
hernandez.
this
court
recognized
in
breard
that
the
fact
that
periodicals
were
sold
did
not
put
them
beyond
the
protection
of
the
first
amendment,
but
the
selling,
however,
brought
into
the
transaction
a
commercial
feature.
this
does
not
mean
that
religious
organizations
are
to
be
treated
as
commercial
businesses,
but
only
that
when
a
religious
organization
seeks
to
raise
funds
by
selling
tangible
personal
property,
it
may
become
subject
to
non-discriminating
general
revenue-raising
statutes
such
as
the
california
sales
and
use
tax
law.
swaggart
also
contends
that
another
administrative
burden
in
complying
with
the
sales
and
use
tax
laws
would
be
entanglement,
caused
allegedly
through
intrusive
monitoring,
on-site
investigations,
audits,
allegedly
all
touching
on
religious
matters
of
significance.
the
record
clearly
doesn't
support
this
and
neither
does
common
sense.
in
fact,
there
would
be
more
of
a
risk
of
improper
entanglement
if
an
exemption
based
solely
on
religious
grounds
is
mandated.
the
briefs
of
this
case
reflect
a
debate
of
what
is
and
isn't
religious,
and
what
is
and
isn't
core.
swaggart
has
conceded
that
tax
is
due
on
t-shirts,
mugs,
pens
and
other
items
that
it
says
"do
not
have
specific
religious
message
content.
"
should
courts
be
burdened
with
lawsuits
to
determine
what
items
are
core
or
contain
religious
message
content.
would
symbolic
items
qualify:
instrumental
music,
bumper
stickers,
making
such
determinations
would
clearly
involve
entanglement
concerns
under
the
first
amendment.
if
the
board
is
compelled
to
grant
exemptions
based
on
religious
content,
then
the
potential
for
discrimination
against
religious...
religions,
could
exist
due
to
administrative
decisions
as
to
what
is
or
isn't
religious.
this
potential
for
discrimination
has
been
disfavored
by
this
court,
especially
when
exercised
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
my
next
point
is
that
the
board's
position
is
not
inconsistent
with
murdock
and
follett,
as
asserted
by
swaggart
in
his
reply
brief.
it
is
correct
the
board
does
not
rely
on
the
privilege
analysis
undertaken
by
this
court
in
murdock,
because
it
was
effectively
overruled
by
this
court
in
complete
auto.
as
a
proper
analysis,
it
is
based
upon
the
nature
of
the
tax
rather
than
its
label.
contrary
to
swaggart's
assertion
in
his
reply
brief,
the
board
distinguishes
murdock
based
upon
the
difference
between
all
the
facts
in
that
case
from
those
present
in
this
case.
murdock
involved
a
special
occupation
tax,
a
flat
tax,
payable
in
advance,
unrelated
to
receipts
or
income
of
the
solicitor,
and
imposes
a
condition
to
solicit.
it
was
a
prior
restraint.
none
of
these
facts
exist
in
this
case.
as
this
court
observed
in
its
footnote
9
in
minneapolis
star,
a
generally
applicable
sales
tax
is
distinguishable
from
the
taxes
in
murdock
and
follett.
justice
brennan
in
texas
monthly
observed
that
the
sales
tax
there
was
equal
to
a
small
fraction
of
the
value
of
each
sale,
and
in
view
of
its
generality,
could
not
be
viewed
as
an
attempt
to
curtail
religious
activity.
my
final
point
concerns
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
swaggart
asserts
that
it
was
not
required
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies
regarding
nexus
because
the
california
courts
did
not
always
follow
said
rule.
swaggart
misstates
california
law
on
this
point.
sales
and
use
tax
matters,
this
court,
in
richfield
oil
corporation
v.
state
board
of
equalization,
a
1946
case,
recognized
the
jurisdictional
procedural
requirement
for
filing
a
claim
and
setting
forth
the
grounds
in
said
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
analysis
in
swaggart
below
clearly
states
california
law
on
the
issue
of
exhaustion.
california
sales
and
use
tax
law
achieves
a
religious
neutrality
in
its
application
because
sales
of
tangible
personal
property
are
subject
to
tax,
irrespective
of
the
contents
or
who
is
selling
or
who
is
buying
that
property.
swaggart
is
using
the
free
exercise
clause
as
a
sword
to
claim
an
exemption
that
it
does
not
mandate,
and
that
california
would
otherwise
be
prohibited
to
give
a
religious
organization
under
the
establishment
clause.
i
think
it
is
interesting
in
this
case
that
swaggart
concedes
that
the
individual
that
goes
to
a
bookstore
has
to
pay
tax,
to
a
commercial
bookstore,
or
i
guess
now
even
a
nonprofit
bookstore.
but
its
only
concerns
are
whether
swaggart
is
involved
in
the
transaction
or
not.
i
think
that
is
a
line
that
just
doesn't
seem
reasonable.
these...
as
pointed
out
by
one
of
the
judges,
when
someone
reads
a
book
or
buys
a
book,
is
he
not
doing
it
for
basically
the
same
purpose
when
he
is
buying
it
from
swaggart?
initially
in
their
brief
they
started
out
with
a
proposition
that
religious
organizations
are
exempt
from
tax.
then
throughout
their
brief
they
sort
of
moved
away
from
that
position
and
narrowed
it
down
to
only
when
they
sell
religious
material.
initially
they
started
this
case
saying
because
they
had
less
funds
that
was
a
burden,
but
they
concede
that
by
paying
other
secular
taxes
on
other
types
of
materials
that
they
use
they
have
less
funds--
mr.
richard
e.
nielsen
--that's
the
point.
unless
there
is
any
questions,
i
have
concluded.
