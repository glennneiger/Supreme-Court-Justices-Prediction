mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
walz
v.
tax
commission
this
court
observed
that
the
hazards
of
churches
supporting
government
are
hardly
less
in
their
potential
than
the
hazards
of
government
supporting
churches.
the
circumstances
of
this
case
bear
out
the
court's
warning.
the
tax
in
this
case
is
imposed
directly
on
the
most
central
and
protected
of
activities
by
religious
organizations,
namely
the
dissemination
of
religious
doctrine
and
worship.
at
issue
are
sermons
that
have
been
preached
from
the
pulpit
and
then
presented
both
in
printed
form
and
in
the
form
of
tapes,
religious
books,
such
as
the
life-changing
prayer
manual,
bible
study
aids,
religious
tracts,
religious
music,
both
instrumental
and
choral,
and
various
bibles
prepared
for
specific
purposes
by
the
ministries
for
the
use
of
its...
of
its
adherents.
california
is
the
first
state
to
assert
the
authority
to
tax
materials
of
this
sort.
since
the
1930s
and
'40s,
when
sales
and
use
taxes
came
into
widespread
use,
these
specifically
religious
activities
and
transactions
have
consistently
been
held
to
be
immune
from
taxation.
now,
in
part
this
is
because
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
trilogy
of
cases
in
murdock
v.
pennsylvania,
jones
v.
onelika,
and
follett
v.
mccormick,
which
held
that
the
dissemination
of
religious
materials
by
itinerant
and
other
evangelists
for
the
purpose
of
communicating
their
message
is
exempt
even
from
generally
applicable
taxes
on
other
commercial
vendors.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that
is
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
point
of
the
decisions
is
that
that
flat
license
tax
in
the
context
of
individual
itinerant
evangelists
amounted
to
a
very
serious
burden
on
their
ability
to
communicate
the
message.
it's
our
position,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
tax
in
this
case,
although
not
flat,
is
similarly
a
serious,
substantial
burden
on
the...
on
the
communication
of
the
materials
under
the
circumstances
today,
not--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--justice
o'connor,
the
tax
can
be
passed
on
to
the
purchaser.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
it
is
the
norm,
but,
justice
o'connor,
don't
get
me
wrong.
we
are
not
complaining
that
this,
that
the
religious
organization
itself
necessarily
has
to
pay
the
tax.
the
point
is
that
the
transaction,
the
dissemination
of
religious
materials,
is
itself
burdened,
discouraged,
inhibited
by
this
tax.
and
you
may
say
that
6
percent
is
not
a
lot--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--justice
o'connor,
the...
it's
almost
a
golden,
an
iron
rule
of
economics
that
when
the
price
of
something
is
increased
the
number
of
sales
are
going
to
go
down.
but,
in
addition
to
that,
the
very...
the
aspect
of
this
tax
that
makes
it
particularly
troubling
to
religious
organizations
is
not
so
much
the
6
percent,
or
6.5
or
7...
remember
there
are
three
different
rates
in
california,
but
the...
but
the
almost
impossible
administrative
difficulty
of
dealing
with
the
varying
and
changing
rates
of
tax
in
some
7,000
taxing
jurisdictions
around
the
country.
and
the
record
in
this
case
shows
that
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
that
kind
of
a
burden
is
something
that
only
the
largest
ministries
could
possibly
deal
with.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
two
reasons,
justice
scalia.
first
of
all,
when
an
ordinary
commercial
bookstore
is
selling
a
bible
simply
for
profit,
it
is
not
doing
so
for
the
purpose
of
communicating
a
particular
religious
philosophy.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that
may--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--the
constitutional
protection
here
has
to
do
with
the
longstanding
relationship
between
religious
institutions
and
the
government,
under
which
religious
institutions
are
both
immune
and
exempt
from
various
forms
of
regulation
and
taxation,
and
also
ineligible
for
subsidies
and
other
forms
of
support.
the
principle
here
is
that
the
government
must
leave
religious
organizations
alone
insofar
as
they
are
engaged
in
the
dissemination
of
religious
materials.
when
b.
dalton
sells
a
bible,
it
is
not...
it
is
not
part
of
that
tradition.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
think
it
would
be
a
mistake
for
this
court
to
try
to
paint
with
too
broad
a
brush.
various
taxes
have
very
different
impacts.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
what
i
mean
by
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
government
must
leave
the
churches
alone
in
their
dissemination
of
religious
doctrine
and
in
their
worship
activities.
i
don't
know
how,
ultimately,
a
property
tax
would
come
out
if
the
state
or
local
government
were
to...
were
to
abolish
the
exemptions
that
have
existed
throughout
our
constitutional
history,
but
this
court
in
follett,
and
in...
and
in
murdock,
indicated
that
there
might
well
be
a
distinction.
and
several
lower
courts
have
held
in
the
context
of
personal,
not
real,
property
taxes
that
there
is
a
distinction.
and
if
i
might
inform
the
court
of
the
distinction
that
those
courts
have
found,
there,
the
principle
is...
is
that
property
is
not
itself
a
religious
act,
that
the
free
exercise
clause
is
concerned
with
the
exercise
of
religion,
that
is,
the
actual
transmission
of
religious
doctrine
and
the
worship
of
religion.
property...
the
ownership
of
property
that
might
be
used
in
the
course
of
that
is
one
step
removed.
it
is
something
that
might
be
useful
for
the
exercise
of
religion,
maybe
even
necessary
in
some
cases,
but
it
is
not
the
act
of
religion
itself.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
first
of
all,
justice
scalia,
it
is
not
clear
that
there
is
a
quid
pro
quo
in
the
sense
that...
and
that
the
record
shows
that
it
is
a
policy
of
appellant
to
distribute
these
materials,
whether
they
receive
the
price
or
not.
but
the
other...
but
the
other
thing
to
consider
is
that
there
are
two
sides.
the
two
sides
of
this
transaction
are
on
the
one
hand
the
ministries,
which
is
trying
to
communicate
the
gospel
as
it
understands
it,
and
at
the
same
time
to
try
to
defray
the
cost
of
doing
so.
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
receiver
is
both
engaged
in
receiving
the
message
and
also
in
supporting
the
conveyance
of
this
message
to
further
believers
at
the
same
time.
the...
the
monetary
aspect
of
the
transaction
is
completely
tied
to
the...
to
the
communication
of
the
message.
as
this
court
quite
clearly
held
in
murdock,
the
fact
that
money
changes
hands
in
the
course
of
the
transaction
does
not
transform
this
religious
practice,
which
is
of
millennia,
literally
millennia
old,
into
a
purely
commercial
transaction.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
greater,
but
most
importantly,
very
different.
the
tax
that
was
upheld
in
lee
was
a
tax
upon
secular
employment
by
a
farmer,
by
farmers
working
in
agricultural
labor.
their
objection
to
the
tax
was
its
use.
they
objected
to
the
social
security
system
because
of
their
religious
tenets,
and
therefore
believed
that
they
should
not
have
to
pay
the
tax.
we
are
not
contending
that
there
is
anything
about
the
tenets
or
doctrines
of
the
ministries
that
entitle
them
to
an
exemption.
it
is
the
fact
of
being
a
religious
organization--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
separation
of
church
and
state
has
to
do
with
the
institutional
relationship
between
religious
organizations
and
government.
it
doesn't
hinge
upon
whether,
upon
the
particular
ecclesiology
or
view
of
church/state
relations
that
any
individual
church
organization
has.
it
goes
back
to
the
basic
principle
that
james
madison
advocated
and
that
this
court
has
come
back
to
in
case
after
case,
which
is
that
the
civil
jurisdiction
has
no
cognizance
over
the...
over
the
practice
of
religion.
and
that
is
going
to
hold
true
for
all
religions
and
not
just...
not
just
those
with
particular
tenets.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
i
think
that
a
general
sales
tax
can
be
imposed
upon
profit
making
corporations
in
the
sale
of
newspapers.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
ministries
is
a
nonprofit
organization,
and
so
in
the
technical
tax
sense
there
is
no
profit
at
all.
if
by
that
you
are
asking
whether
the
cost
of
the
materials
exceeds
the
revenue
directly
from
that...
the
record
is...
is
not
very
clear
on
the
point.
in
the
record,
however,
you
will
find
of
the
form
990,
the
federal
income
tax
returns
from
the
ministries,
which
indicate
that
insofar
as
you
are
looking
specifically
at
the...
at
the
pure
sales,
the
i'll
send
you
$10
and
you
send
me
a
sermon
tape,
that
kind
of
a
pure
sale,
that
in
fact
the
materials,
the
cost
of
the
materials
falls,
is,
greatly
exceeds
the
revenue
that
is
generated.
it
is
only
when
you
take
into
consideration
the
contributions
that
are
received
in
connection
with
the
distribution
of
these
materials
and
other
activities
of
the
ministries
that
this
is...
that
they
are
able
to
keep
their
heade
above
water.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
court...
i
was
in
a
sense
summarizing
the
court's
holdings.
in
breard
v.
alexandria,
the
court
confronted
the
question
of
sales
by
a
profit-making
magazine
distributor,
and
this
was
shortly,
this
was
just
ten
years
after
murdock,
and
the
court
distinguished
between
for
profit
businesses
and
non-commercial
businesses...
non-commercial
speakers
in
the
context
of
disseminating
their
messages.
i
don't
really
know
what
a
nonprofit
newspaper
would
be
like,
but
if,
for
example,
you
might
be
referring
to
a
political
organization
that
would
be
distributing,
let's
say
the
sierra
club
might
sell
a
book,
not
just
for
the
purpose
of
making
money
on
it,
but
because
it
contains
information
that
they
want
to
get
out
to
the
public,
i
think
that
is
a
difficult
question,
but--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--well,
it
is
difficult
because
the
sierra
club
is
not
a
religious
organization
and
there
is
no
requirement
of
separation
between
the
government
and
what
the
sierra
club
is
doing.
if
the
government
wanted
to
give
a
direct
subsidy
to
the
sierra
club
to
produce
and
disseminate
that
book,
the
constitution
would
not
be
offended.
the
government
is
permitted
to
subsidize
the
sierra
club's
dissemination
of
it
doctrine.
it
is
not
permitted--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--i
am
suggesting
that
it
probably
could,
and
that
the
difference
is
that...
is
that
a
religious
organization
is
any...
stands
in
a
different
footing.
a
religious
organization
may
not
be...
may
neither
be
subsidized,
nor
may
it
be
taxed,
for
the
dissemination
of
its
message.
whereas,
i
think
that
most
other
non-commercial
organizations
could.
whether
there
might
be
some
argument
under
the
free
speech
clause,
i
don't
know,
but
those
issues
are
not...
if
so,
those
issues
are
not
being
raised
here.
the
key,
the
key
point
that
i
would
like
to
emphasize
here
is
that
it
is
simply
not
the
case
in
our
constitutional
tradition
that
religious
organizations
are
to
be
treated
the
same
way
as
commercial
book
sellers,
or
even
as
other
nonprofit
organizations.
that
has
not
been
the
case
for
200
years,
and
the
reason
is
that
the
obligations
of
separation,
of
a
division
of
the
spheres
of
authority,
and
those
with
respect
to
religion
and
government,
that
that
has
been
kept,
that
has
been
kept
carefully
apart
by
the
first
amendment
and
by
the
practices
of
the
states
in
compliance
with
the
first
amendment
and
their
own
constitutions
in
the
years
since
then.
that
this
tradition
is
different
from
the
tradition
ascribed
to
commercial
businesses,
and
it
has
to
be
that
way.
because
the
government
is
able
to
regulate,
and
indeed
even
put
out
of
business,
an
ordinary
commercial
business.
other
than
any
limit,
any
remaining
tinges
of
substantive
due
process
that
there
might
be
in
the
economic
sphere,
essentially
the
government
can
do
what
it
wants
with
commercial
businesses.
the
same
thing
is
just
not
true
of
religious
organizations.
with
religious
organizations,
the...
the
requirement
of
the
constitution
is
that
the
government
keep
its
hands
off.
it
may
not
help
them;
it
cannot
assist
them
or
subsidize
them
when...
in
their
dissemination
of
religious
doctrine,
but
it
does
not
have
the
authority
to...
to
tax
them
or
to
regulate
them
in
those
areas.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that
is
right.
this
court
has
carefully--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--this
court
has
carefully
distinguished
between
various
forms
of
municipal
services
that
indirect...
that
provide
indirect
benefits
to
religious
organizations,
along
with
all
others,
and
direct
subsidies
of
cash,
even
when
those
direct
subsidies
of
cash
are
being
distributed
on
a...
on
a
general
and
completely
neutral
basis.
take,
for
example,
the
court's
recent
decision
in
bowen
against
kendrick,
in
which
religious
organizations
were
allowed
to
participate
in...
in
the
adolescent
family
life
act
programs.
but
this
court
held,
and
i
believe
rightly,
that
none
of
those
organizations
participating
in
that
could
be
permitted
to
use
any
of
that
money,
or
even
their
own
money
in
the
course
of
the
program,
to
disseminate
religious
doctrine
in
the
course
of
administering
that.
even
though...
even
though
secular
organizations
are
being
treated
perfectly
equally,
religious
organizations
are
under
a
special
constitutional
disability
to
use
government
funds
for
the...
for
the
dissemination
of
religious
doctrine.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
separation
is
a
two
way
street.
it
is
not
true
that
churches
are
only
separate
from
the
government
when
it
comes
to
subsidies.
they
are
also
separate
from
the
government
when
it
comes
to
the
government
calling
upon
them
to
support
the
government,
when
that
support
is
based
upon
their
spreading
of
the
gospel
as
they
understand
it.
it
is...
the...
a
religious
organizations
carrying
out
its
religious
function
may
not
be
used
as
an
occasion
for
fund
raising
by
the
state.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
well,
justice
stevens--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that
is
right,
but
subsidy
and
penalty
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin,
just
as
free
exercise
and
establishment
are
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
the
principle
is
one
of
separate
jurisdictions,
that...
and
i'm
going...
i'm
referring
now,
again,
to
james
madison's
original
formulation
of
this
theory
in
his
memorial
and
remonstrance,
which
this
court
has
referred
to
dozens
of
times
in
explicating
the,
the
religion
clauses.
the
point
is
that
the
civil
jurisdiction
does
not
have
authority
over
religion,
whether
to
subsidize
it
or
to...
or
to
penalize
it,
or
to
tax
it
or
to
regulate
it.
only,
the
only--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--i
do
not
deny
that
a
secular
wine
producer
who
produces
the
sacramental
wine
could
be
taxed--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--that
a
transaction
between
the
church
and
commercial
entities
is
subject
to
tax.
when
the
church
is
going
in...
is
dealing
with
profit-making,
non-religious
bodies,
that
transaction
is
not
an
exercise
of
religion.
when,
however,
a
ministry
is
providing
a
bible
to
one
of
its
believers,
even
if
it
is
receiving
money
in
return,
that
is
a...
that
is
the
exercise
of
religion,
and
that
is
what
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
most
important
point
here,
then,
is
that...
is
that
the
state's
simple
position
that
so
long
as
commercial
businesses
are
being
treated
the
same
way,
that
it
does
not...
that
their
tax
simply
doesn't
raise
a
constitutional
question,
i
think
has
to
be
rejected.
it
is
a
somewhat
more
difficult
question
whether,
once...
once
we
recognize
that
the
special
status
of
religious
organizations
in
their
carrying
out
of
religious
functions
requires
special
treatment,
whether
this
particular...
or
where
does
one
draw
the
line.
does
this
particular
side
of
transactions
warrant
constitutional
immunity?
and
it
is
here
where
i
think
justice
stevens'
question
is...
is
most
important,
because
our
position
is
not
that
religious
organizations
are
exempt
or
immune
from
taxation
with
respect
to
everything
that
they
do.
and
in
fact,
religion...
it
has
been
the
religious
community,
particularly
the
national
council
of
churches
and
the
united
states
catholic
bishops
conference,
which
has
insisted
in
the
federal
area
that
that...
that
that
is
intolerable
and
unconstitutional
a
claim.
churches
should
not
be
exempt
in
everything
that
they
do.
what
churches
should
be
exempt
in
is
their
actual
dissemination
of
religious
doctrine
and
their
carrying
on
of
worship
with
those
who
choose
to
receive
their
message
or
participate
in
their
worship
services.
and
it's
that
narrow
claim,
the
same
claim
that
was
upheld
in
murdock
and
jones
and
follett,
that
we
are
defending
here
today.
in
addition
to
this,
there
is
a
separate
ground
of
objection
that
we
have
to
the
imposition
of
tax
in
this
particular
case,
which
would
apply
even
if
the
court
were
not
to
conclude
that
religious
organizations
are
immune
from
taxation--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--the
distinction
is...
is
the
purpose
of
providing
this
thing,
this
tape,
to
spread
the
word
or
is
it
to
make
a
buck.
and
the
record
here
makes
it
very
clear--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--but
the
record
here
is
very
clear,
and
the
state
has
not
challenged
that
the
reason
why
the
ministries
is
distributing
these
materials
is
to
get
them
out
to
the
public.
that
is
the
whole
purpose
of
it.
now,
to
be
sure,
getting
the
word
out
requires...
requires
money,
just
as
it
required
money
in
murdock
and
jones
and
follett.
but
the...
but
this
ministry
is
not
in
the
business
to
make
money;
it
is
in
the
business
to
spread
the
bibles
and
the
religious
tracts
and
sermon
tapes
and
so
forth
to
people
who
are
interested
in
hearing
the
word.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
that
would
be
a
question
that
goes
to
income
tax
rather
than
sales
tax,
because
a
sales
tax
is
collected
on
the
whole--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--oh,
yes,
yes.
and
indeed
exempt
from
income
tax
under
the
federal
income
laws
as
well.
in
a
sense
what
i
am
suggesting
here
is
that
the
congress,
in
devising
its
federal
income
tax
laws,
is
essentially
drawing
the
line
that
the
first
amendment
had
already
drawn
at
a
constitutional
level,
when
the
federal
income
tax
code
taxes
churches
for
their
income
that
they
receive
in
the
course
of
businesses
that
are
not
related
to
their
religious
purposes,
but
exempts
them
from
the
income
that
they
receive
on
activities
that
are
related
to
their
exempt
purposes,
namely
the
carrying
out
of
their
religious
activities.
was
there...
did
i
cut
off
a
question?
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
your
honor,
the
record
is
quite
clear
as
to
each
and
every
one
of
these
items.
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
as
to
precisely
why
it
was
developed,
what
function
it
plays
in
the...
in
the
ministry,
and
that
the
purpose
of
all
of
this
is
to
spread
the
gospel.
now,
all
of
us
can
be
somewhat
cynical,
and
with
good
reason,
that
there
are
those
engaged
in
the
practice
of
religion
that
have,
that
do
that
for
their
own
private
purposes.
but
the
law
accounts
for
that
in
prosecution
such
as
we
have
seen
recently.
but,
unless
that
kind
of...
unless
we
are
going
to
say
that
all
religious
leaders
are
charlatans,
we
have
to
recognize
that
a
distinction...
has
to
be...
has
to
be
made.
and
if
there
is
a
suggestion
that
this
is
being
done
for
private
profit
rather
than
for
the
religious
purposes,
the
laws
of
every
state
allow
for
the
state
to
challenge
the
exemption
on
that
basis.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
the
record--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--your
honor,
the
record
shows
that
at
a
time--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--the
record
shows
that
at
a
time
when
the
annual
revenues
of
this
ministry
were
$28
million,
the
total...
the
total
compensation
for
all
officers
and
directors
was
$110,000.
and
jimmy
swaggart
himself
was
getting
a
salary
of
$20,000.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
reserved
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
points.
it
is
interesting
to
hear
my
friend
talk
about
california's
commitment
to
no
exemptions
from
its
sales
tax,
and
how
long
this
practice
has
been
in
effect.
i
have
here
the
sales
and
use
tax
law,
chapter
4
exemptions.
there
is
a
page
and
a
half
of
them,
beginning
with
gas,
electricity
and
water,
gold
monetized
bullions,
vessels,
ice,
bottled
water,
bracelets
commemorating
american
prisoners
of
war
and,
most
importantly,
newspapers
and
periodicals,
the
value
of
which
in
total
is
many
times
the
value
of
religious
materials.
the
state
is
evidently
engaged
in
riddling
its
tax
code
with
exemptions.
it
is
just
not
interested
in
the
free
exercise
of
religion.
however,
there
is
also
the
problem
that
perhaps
this
is
a
new-found
proposition.
my
friend
says
that
this
practice
of
the
state
of
taxing
religious
articles
goes
back
to
the
'30s
or
the
'40s,
but,
as
we
have
cited
in
our
brief,
the...
an
official
opinion
of
the
state
attorney
general
issued
in
1980
which
flatly
contradicts
that
proposition.
now,
i
gather
that
there
is
some
difference
of
opinion
between
the
board
of
equalization
and
the
state
attorney
general,
but
at
least
his
opinion,
upon
which
we
relied
during
the
tax
period,
would
seem
to
stand
as
some
kind
of
an
authoritative
statement
of
the
state's
position
on
this.
i
might
add
that
after
the
administrative
proceeding
in
this
case,
a
different
appellant
court
and
a
different
division
in
california,
and
the
institute
for
basic
youth
conflicts,
also
held
that
as
a
constitutional
matter
california
could
not
impose
a
sales
tax
on
religious
organizations
disseminating
religious
material.
so
this
is
not
such
a
long-standing
practice.
the
final
observation
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
i
don't
want
the
court
to
forget,
just
because
it
hasn't
been
a
subject
of
the
argument
today,
that
there
is
the
second
problem
of
the
chilling
effect
on
an
out-of-state
ministry
of
the
way
california
calculates
nexus.
because
under
the
commerce
and
due
process
clauses,
california
would
not
be
able
to
require
a
ministry
located
in
louisiana
to
pay
any
of
this
tax
at
all,
but
for
the
fact
that
the
ministries
conducts
occasional
worship
services,
evangelistic
crusades
within
the
state--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--it
was
presented
to
the
superior
court--
mr.
michael
w.
mcconnell
--and
it
did
not
pass
on
it.
no,
your
honor.
the
impact
here
is
quite
plain,
if
you,
if
you
are
conducting
a
national
ministry
and
you
have
mail
transactions
with
your
adherents
throughout
the
country,
you
had
better
not
go
and
conduct
any
worship
services
in
california.
it
could
be
a
very
costly
thing
to
do.
it
is
that
kind
of
chilling
effect
that
we
believe
that
the
free
exercise
clause
prohibits.
the
general
theme
of
my
friend's
presentation
is
his
statement,
and
i
quote,
"the
concern
of
crippling
a
religious
organization
is
left
to
the
political
process.
"
your
honors,
i
submit
that
that
is
not
true,
that
the
concern
for
crippling
religious
organizations
at
the
hands
of
the
state
was
this
very
subject
of
the
first
amendment.
thank
you.
