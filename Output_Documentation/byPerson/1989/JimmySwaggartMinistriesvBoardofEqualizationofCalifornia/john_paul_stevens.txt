justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
the
difference
between
the
two
that
one
is
prohibited
by
the
establishment
clause,
and
you
are
making
a
free
exercise
claim,
aren't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
the
subsidy
is
an
establishment
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
think
you
acknowledged
that
if
you
had
sales,
say
you
sell
sacramental
wine
or
vestments
or
something
like
that
to
a
church
organization
for
use
in
purely
religious
ceremonies,
i
don't
think
you
deny
that
a
tax
could
be
imposed
on
those,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
just
pursue
a
minute,
because
i
want
to
be
sure
i
thoroughly
understand
your
answer
to
my
previous
question.
the
sale
of
a
tape
recording
of
a
sermon
by
a
minister,
that
a
person
would
listen
to
sometime
later
at
his
or
her
leisure,
the
sales
transaction,
you
say,
is
the
same
as
if
the
person
were
attending?
what
is
the
dividing
line
between
a
commercial
transaction
and
a
religious
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
to
spread
the
word
and
to
get
the
money
for
the
religious
ministry,
both,
always,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--isn't
your
opponent
quite
right
that
that
is
an
iron
rule
of
economics?
you
cannot
raise
the
price
and
have
the
number
of
sales
be
precisely
the
same.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure.
and
that
even
a
small
increment
will
discourage
some
sales.
i
mean,
you
really
have
to
make
that
assumption,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
that
point,
may
i
just
ask
you,
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that
this
is
really
the
first
time
that
this
particular
kind
of
levy
has
been
imposed
by
a
state?
if
it
is,
it
is
kind
of
strange
to
say
it
is
going
to
destroy
your
revenue
resources
not
to
be
able
to
do
something
nobody
else
has
ever
done.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
his
point,
i
think
one
of
his
points
is
that
we
have
been
in
this
business
for
a
couple
hundred
years,
and
the
systems
have
gotten
along
perfectly
well
without
ever...
with
just
precisely
the
kind
of
exemption
he
is
asking
for
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
answer,
i
guess,
is
that
in
california
the
rule
has
always
been
the
same;
we
just
have
a
new
kind
of
religious
ministry
that
is
selling
articles
that
generate
this
kind
of
revenue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
what's
new,
not
the...
not
a
new
law.
