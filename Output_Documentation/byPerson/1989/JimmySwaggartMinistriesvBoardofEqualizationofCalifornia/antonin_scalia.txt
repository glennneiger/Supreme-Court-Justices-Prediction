justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mcconnell,
i
assume
that
there
is
no
more...
maybe
i
shouldn't
assume
it.
is
there
any
more
right
to
convey
a
religious
message
than
there
is
to
receive
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
held...
we
held
last
term,
if
i
recall
correctly,
that
a
state
not
only
could
impose
a
tax
upon
the
sale
of
bibles,
but
indeed
had
to
impose
a
tax
upon
the
sale
of
bibles
if
it
imposed
a
tax
upon
the
sale
of
other
books.
and
the
only
difference
in
that
case,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
seller
was
not
an
itinerant
or
non-itinerant
preacher,
but
was,
as
far
as
the
facts
of
the
case
were
involved,
a
regular
bookstore.
now,
why
wouldn't
that
violate
the
principle
you
are
urging
upon
us
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i
am
buying
it
for
that
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
acknowledged
that
i
have
as
much
right
to
receive
a
religious
message
as
someone
else
has
to
convey
it.
so
long
as
i
want
to
buy
it
for
my
own
religious
edification,
why
shouldn't
that
be
exempt
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't
you
say
the
same
thing
about
the
receipt
of
money?
this
is
just
a
tax
when
you
sell
religious
material,
not
when
you
distribute
it.
and
the
state
is
saying,
you
know,
if
you
want
to
proselytize
and
ask
for
contributions,
that
is
one
thing.
but
if
you
sell
something,
if
it
is
a
quid
pro
quo,
that
is
no
religious
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
really
true,
mr.
mcconnell,
and
maybe
there
are
those
of
us
who
think
some
of
the
cases
suggest
going
too
far
in
both
directions,
both
in
prohibiting
non-discriminatory
assistance
and
in...
and
in
prohibiting
non-discriminatory
taxation.
certainly,
a
municipality
can
station
policemen
in
front
of
a
church
on
a
sunday,
just
as
it
would
station
policemen
in
front
of
any
theater
that
is
having
a
major
opening.
it
can
provide
normal,
municipal
services
to,
even
for
purposes
that
are
directly
related
to
religious
worship,
just
as
it
can
provide
it
to
other
businesses.
indeed
it
must,
i...
i
would
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
can't
it
apply
a
non-discriminatory
tax
similarly?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
wait,
wait,
wait.
i
don't
think
that
that
at
all
establishes
what
you
want
it
to
establish.
all
this
establishes
is
that
where
they
had
a
fixed
price
for
the
book,
they
would
set
that
separately.
but
that
doesn't
at
all
speak
to
whether
the
person
who
paid
the
price
believed
he
was
making
a
donation
or
believed
he
was
engaging
in
a
strictly
commercial
exchange.
i
mean,
that...
that's
a
matter
of
intent
of
the
parties,
it
seems
to
me,
not
of
how
they
carry
it
on
their
books.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
first
one
prove?
i
don't
see
how
that
proves
that
they're
making
a
profit
on
it.
it
just
proves
how
much
we
choose
to
lose
depends
to
some
extent
upon,
you
know,
how
much
we
got
to
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
sales
of
literature
in
the
vestibules
of
churches.
they
just
have
books
up
there,
bibles,
tracts,
and
what
not,
and
they
have
little
prices
under
it,
you
know,
$2,
$1.50.
is
that
taxed?
you're
going
to
tell
me
you
have
no
reason
to
believe
it
is
not.
do
you
know
that
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
that
the
candles
are?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
leave
the
candle
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
buying
the
fire,
i
suppose,
aren't
you?
i
mean--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
buying
something,
i
suppose.
what
about
seats
in
synagogues
on
high
holy
days,
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
see.
it's
only
tangible
personal
property.
but
you
think
the
state
could
tax
that,
no
doubt?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
has
another
kind...
it
has
a
rental
tax.
anybody
who
rents
anything
has
to
pay--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
it
could?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
just
don't,
haven't
thought
of
that
tax
yet,
but
if
they
thought
of
it,
they
could
do
that.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
respond
to
mr.
mcconnell's
point
that
that
is
only
fair
because
it
works
that
way
in
the
other
direction?
the
state
of
california
wants
to
give
money
to
particular
organizations
that
do
good
things,
it
can,
but
it
can't
give
money
to
a
church
that
does
those
good
things
in
the
course
of
its
ministry.
i
mean,
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
state
can
tax
these
candles,
but
if
it
decides
it
is
going
to
have
a
candle
distribution
program
to
all
organizations
that
want
candles,
you
don't
have
any
doubt
that
it
couldn't
give
candles
to
a...
to
a
church
that
is
going
to
use
them
for
devotional
purposes.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
idea
in
any
case
that
no
person
who
would
otherwise
have
bought
one
of
these
bibles
or
tracts,
was
dissuaded...
would
be
dissuaded
by
the
additional
six
or
seven
percent?
justice
antonin
scalia
except
for
the
argument
that
the
higher
the
price
the
lower
the
number
of
purchases.
is
that
an
extraordinary
argument?
you
don't
challenge
the
iron--
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe,
but
you,
you
don't
know...
you
cannot
say
of
your
own
knowledge
that
in
fact
churches
that
sell
tracts
in
their
vestibules
or
that
sell
candles
or
other
things
have
been
paying
this
tax.
do
you
know
that
they
have?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
one
doesn't
have
to
pay
a
self-assessed
tax
one
believes
is
unconstitutional.
and
it
may
well
be
that
all
the
churches
in
california
have
been
proceeding
on
the
same
basis
that
mr.
swaggart
proceeded
on,
that
they
didn't
have
to
pay
for
these
things.
i
frankly
find
it,
you
know...
maybe
you
do
have
agents
who
walk
into
the
vestibules
of
churches
and
check
out
how
many
of
these
things
are
being
sold.
