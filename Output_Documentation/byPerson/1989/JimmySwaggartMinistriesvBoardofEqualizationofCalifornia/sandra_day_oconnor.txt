justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
mcconnell,
what
is
the
evidence
that
the
imposition
of
the
ordinary
sales
tax,
i
guess
it
is
around
6
percent,
would
burden
the
petitioner?
i
assume
the
tax
is
passed
on,
is
it
not,
to
the
purchaser?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
the
norm
in...
when
sales
tax
is
opposed...
imposed,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
any
indication
that
sales
are
reduced
by
virtue
of
the
imposition
of
the
tax?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
mcconnell,
the
court
certainly
sustained
in
lee
a
rather
substantial
burden
on
the
exercise
of
religion.
do
you
think
this
imposes
a
greater
burden
than
the
burden
in
lee,
which
the
court
upheld?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
would
be,
that
would
be
an
even
stronger
claim
than
yours,
would
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
a
general
sales
tax
can
be
imposed
on
the
sale
of
newspapers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
ministry
make
a
profit
on
any
of
the
items
it
sells?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
nielsen,
does
the
state
tax
also,
for
example,
the
sale
of
votive
candles
in
the
catholic
churches
in
california?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
california
taxing
these
things
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
california
can
levy
a
generally
applicable
property
tax
on
property
owned
by
religious
institutions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
the
rate
were
so
high
that
the
evidence
showed
it
prevented
some
adherents
of
the
faith
from
obtaining
religious
materials
they
wanted
for
their
worship?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
california.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
california’s
imposition
of
sales
and
use
tax
liability
on
a
religious
organization’s
sale
of
religious
materials
does
not
contravene
the
religion
clauses
of
the
first
amendment.
the
collection
on
payment
of
a
generally
applicable
sales
and
use
tax
does
not
violate
the
free
exercise
clause
because
such
a
tax
imposes
no
constitutionally
significant
burden
on
an
adherence
religious
practices
or
beliefs.
neither
does
such
a
tax
violate
the
establishment
clause
because
a
state
does
not
foster
excessive
entanglement
with
religion
simply
by
imposing
these
generally
applicable
administrative
and
record-keeping
duties
on
religious
organizations.
because
the
issue
is
not
decided
below,
we
do
not
reach
the
claims
that
imposition
of
the
tax
on
certain
mail
order
sales
violates
the
commerce
and
due
process
clauses.
the
judgment
of
the
california
court
of
appeal
is
affirmed
and
the
decision
of
this
court
is
unanimous.
