chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
88-1374,
jimmy
swaggart
ministries
v.
the
board
of
equalization
of
california.
mr.
mcconnell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
you
were
dealing
with
a
flat
license
tax,
were
you
not,
mr.
mcconnell?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
say,
mr.
mcconnell,
that
the
government
must
exempt
churches
from
real
property
taxation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
it
is
you
who
are
painting
with
a
broad
brush,
when
you
say
that
the
government
must
simply
stay
away
from
all
religions,
and
i
got
the
implication,
perhaps
not
tax
any
aspect
of
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcconnell,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
a
moment
ago,
or
perhaps
to
suggest,
that
the
government
could
not
tax
a
nonprofit
corporation
which
published
a
newspaper?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
difficult
about
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
haven't
yet
pointed
out
what
the...
you're
saying
where
the
difficulties
aren't.
where
is
the
difficulty?
why
can't
the
government,
if
it
taxes
all
other
sales
of
magazines,
tax
the
sales
of
a
nonprofit
corporation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mcconnell.
mr.
nielsen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nielsen,
you
referred
us
to
a
page
of
the
record.
now,
what
question
and
answer
are
you
talking
about
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
mr.
mcconnell's
point
was
that
the
cost
of
the
tapes
to
them
exceeded
the
sale
price,
not
that
it
was
a
donation,
but
just
that
they
didn't
charge
as
much
for
the
thing
as
it
cost
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
have
lost
all
along
the
line.
it
would
be
strange
if
they
didn't
change
their
argument,
wouldn't
it?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nielsen.
mr.
mcconnell,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
four
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcconnell.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-1374,
jimmy
swaggart
ministries
versus
board
of
equalization
of
california
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
