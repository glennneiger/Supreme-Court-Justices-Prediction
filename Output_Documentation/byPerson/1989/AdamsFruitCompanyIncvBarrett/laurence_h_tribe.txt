mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
expressly
created
and
rather
carefully
delimited
the
private
right
of
action
involved
in
this
case
after
hearing
some
quite
dramatic
testimony
about
actual
damages
in
a
disaster
in
blythe,
california
where
about
50
migrants
were
maimed
or
killed
in
the
crash
of
a
single
unsafe
vehicle.
now,
there
was
workers'
comp
available
there.
california
was
the
most
generous
of
the
states.
it
didn't
impress
congress.
maybe
they
made
a
mistake.
but
for
better
or
for
worse,
congress
indisputably
concluded
that
workers'
compensation
was
an
inadequate
remedy
and
the
house
report
makes
absolutely
plain
what
the
language
of
1854's
predecessor
made
plain
anyway.
that
was
that
they
thought
an
unfettered
federal
civil
remedy
was
indispensable
if
the
law
was
to
work--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--in
1983?
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
let
me
turn
to
that
then,
justice
o'connor.
it
seems
to
me
one
could
take
the
view
that
its
a
bad
fit,
that
congress
sometimes
makes
mistakes
and
that
it's
not
for
this
court
or
for
the
secretary
of
labor
to
rewrite
the
law.
i
think
that
would
be
the
correct
view.
but
i'm
not
so
sure
that
it
is
all
that
silly
a
fit
because
the
history
makes
absolutely
clear
what
was
going
on.
they
tried
in
1978
to
actually
make
workers'
compensation
the
exclusive
remedy
in
what
was
called
the
ireland
bill,
representative
ireland
of
florida.
and
the
language
of
that
provision
would
have
been
quite
explicit.
they
were
worried
not
just
about
being
hit
with
double
insurance
premiums
but
being
hit
with
double
liability
and
may
be
not
having
an
offset.
and
so
the
language
of
that
provision
specifically
talks
about
the
exclusive
remedy
provisions
of
state
workers'
comp
and
would
have
incorporated
that.
that
was
voted
down.
then--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
it
isn't,
justice
scalia.
i
know
they
say
that.
the
difference
is
that
it
contains
the
words...
the
specific
words
"exclusive
remedy
provisions
of
state
workers'
compensation.
"
and
says
that
it
shall
conform
with
that.
those
words,
exclusive
remedy--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
insurance
shall.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it's...
it's
quite
possible,
justice
scalia,
that
if
that
had
become
the
law,
they
would
have
then
argued
that
that
was
enough
for
congress
to
achieve
its
purpose,
and
i
think
then
congress
would
have,
perhaps,
made
a
mistake.
because
then
the
purpose
was
only
to
substitute,
not
just...
the
purpose
then
was
to
deal
with
premiums
and
double
liability.
but
there
is
an
obvious
purpose
to
the--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--okay.
and
then
i
will
try
to
get
back.
in
almost
every
state
their
are
minimum
insurance
requirements
for
vehicle
policies.
but
that
doesn't
meet
anyone's
belief
that
if
they
have
that
insurance,
and
they
are
told
you
needn't
get
anymore,
that
there
will
never
be
liability
over
and
above
it.
here
the
idea
was
that
as
business
enterprises,
agribusiness
should
have
the
freedom
to
decide
to
have
lower
premiums
and
to
gamble
on
an
occasional
big
payout,
which
is
what
would
happen
if
they
chose
to
rest
with
workers'
comp
as
the
exclusive
insurance
coverage
they
would
obtain.
if
the
whole
purpose
of
congress
was
as
suggested
by
petitioner,
namely,
a
kind
of
promise
to
the
employer
that
they
will
be
immune
from
any
uninsured
liability,
then
i
think
it
would
be
incomprehensible,
and
it
would
be
a
much
worse
fit,
because,
as
justice
stevens
points
out,
that's
not
what
farmers
get
here.
in,
let's
say,
the
14
states
where
there
is
no
workers'
compensation
for
migrants,
and
in
the
other
seven
states
where
migrants
are
almost
totally
excluded,
what
happens
is
that
if
an
employer
purchases
all
the
insurance
that
he
is
required
under
this
law
to
obtain...
and
he
is
required
under
the
law
and
the
regs
to
have
at
least
as
much
as
the
interstate
commerce
act
specifies...
he
still
is
exposed
to
liability
over
and
above
that.
it's
not
a
senseless
fit.
it
makes
perfect
sense
in
other
areas
of
the
law.
and
even
if
i
assume,
and
i
am
quite
prepared
to,
that
given
the
precise
wording
of
the
ireland
amendment,
it
too
wouldn't
have
really
achieved
the
extreme
purpose
of
subordinating
the
federal
liability
remedy
to
state
law.
that
amendment
was
rejected.
what
we
have
is
something
that
even
if
i
assume
it's
equivalent
was
at
most
the
ireland
amendment.
we
do
not,
however,
have
anything
in
the
statute
which
departs
from
the
normal
tradition
by
subordinating
the
federal
to
a
state
remedy.
now,
when
congress
wants
to
do
that,
it
does
it
in
very
specific
terms.
the
black
lung
act,
about
which
this
court
heard
argument
just
yesterday,
was
a
perfect
example.
that
gives
the
secretary
of
labor
the
role
of
administering
the
federal
payout,
the
federal
relief.
it's
not
done
through
judicial
action,
but
it's
done
through
the
secretary.
so,
he
has
some
business
there
and
there
would
be
a
way
to
enforce
any
rules
he
made
about
it
because
he
is
the
administrator.
and
then
it
tells
him...
the
act
of
congress
tells
him
to
relegate
the
mine
workers
to
state
workers'
compensation
if
he
finds
that
the
state...
the
state
system
provides
adequate
compensation.
when
congress
wants
to
do
that,
it
knows
how
to
do
it.
it
did
it
in
black
lung.
it
did
it
in
a
slightly
different
way,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act
and
in
the
war
hazards
compensation
act.
but
every
court
that
has
reviewed
a
federal
statute
which
does
not
incorporate
in
its
language
an
exclusive
state
remedy...
such
as,
for
example,
the
jones
act
or
the
longshoremen's
act...
has
understood
that
the
background
rule
against
which
congress
is
writing
is
a
rule
which
says
that
the
federal
remedy
that
you
provide
is
supplementary.
there
may
be
an
offset,
but
it
is
not
suppose
to
have
a
hole
carved
out
of
it
in
every
place
where
a
state
remedy
might
be
provided.
and
when
that
hole
is
carved,
as
it
was
in
the
black
lung
act,
it's
typically
carved
in
a
way
that
gives
the
secretary
the
responsibility
of
deciding
whether
the
state
remedy
to
which
the
worker
would
be
relegated
is
adequate.
it
would
be
extraordinary
to
decide
that
regardless
of
the
adequacy
or
inadequacy
of
state
workers'
compensation,
when
it
is
provided
then
the
federal
remedy
evaporates.
and
that
is
what
this
free-floating
regulation
says,
the
regulation,
which
is
untethered,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
to
any
responsibility
that
the
secretary
of
labor
has
in
administering
this
law,
completely
unhinged
from
any
of
his
functions
in
standard
setting
or
in
investigation
or
in
registration.
it
just
is
a
pronouncement.
that
regulation--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's...
that's
correct.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
would
otherwise...
and
that
really
is
an
anomaly,
i
think,
justice
stevens.
that
i
can't
make
a
lot
of
sense
out
of.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
to
that
extent,
congress
might
have
been
aware
that
that
was
part
of
what
would
happen
from
this
statute.
because,
you
see,
this
issue
that
the
regulation
addressed...
the
issue
of
the
relationship
between
the
federal
remedy
and
state
law...
was
not
one
that
congress
was
inattentive
to.
that
is,
in
some
instances
one
might
say
that
congress
simply
didn't
think
about
the
interaction
between
state
and
federal
law,
left
the
matter
ambiguous,
left
a
kind
of
gap
for
an
administrator
to
fill.
even
then,
it
seems
to
me,
that
under
this
court's
decisions
the
role
of
an
agency
in
filling
a
gap
is
limited
to
its
role
in
filling
gaps
about
what
it
administers,
what's
in
its
charge.
it's
not,
as
justice
scalia
referred
to
in
another
case,
junior
varsity--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
part
of
his
responsibility
under
1841.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
deciding
how
much
insurance
they
have
to
carry
does
not
involve
regulating
the
courts
in
their
remedial
jurisdiction.
it's
one
thing
to
say
to
the
secretary,
you
set
standards
about
safety
belts
and
about
insurance.
and
it's
quite
another
to
say,
you,
as
a
member
of
the
executive
branch,
tell
the
federal
judicial
branch
whether
to
award
actual
damages.
that
would
be
an
extraordinary
delegation
to
the
secretary.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
unlike
the
black
lung
law,
justice
stevens,
the
secretary's
responsibility
here
is
not
to
assure
that
the
economic
welfare
of
these
workers
is
adequately
cared
for.
that
was
the
reason
that
congress
specifically
took
the
economic
issue...
damages,
both
actual
and
statutory...
and
separated
that
completely
from
the
secretary's
enforcement
and
created
expressly
a
private
right
of
action.
the
secretary
sets
health
and
safety
standards.
and
it
is
true
that
he's
suppose
to
worry
about
whether
they
are
undue
burdens.
but
to
say
that
the
secretary's
responsibility
here
is,
in
the
large,
to
make
sure
that
some
system
is
put
in
place
that
best
meets
the
various
needs,
economic
and
otherwise,
of
the
migrants
would
be
an
extremely
broad
delegation
of
authority,
perhaps
constitutional,
but
nowhere
to
be
found
in
this
statute.
that
is,
in
this
statute
the
delegations
of
authority
are
very
specific.
1841(d)
delegates
to
the
secretary
of
labor
a
power,
and
indeed
a
duty,
by
the
effective
date
of
the
law
to
prescribe
what
it
calls
the
standards
required
for
implementing
this
section.
and
it
says
to
do
it
through
regulations
promulgated
in
accord
with
1861,
which
just
absorbs
the
administrative
procedures
act.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
of
course,
the
ability
to
go
into
federal
courts
in
these
circumstances
and
have
a
lawyer
appointed
for
you
is
quite
extraordinary.
and
congress
did
it
knowingly
after
being
regaled
with
rather
dismal
stories
of
how
migrants
are
badly
treated.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
congress
may
not
have
cared
about
them
quite
as
much.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
there
are--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
wouldn't
call
it...
maybe...
maybe
chevrolet,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
the...
the
fact
is
that
migrants
are
treated
differently
throughout
federal
law.
they're
not
entitled
to
the
protections
of
osha.
they're
not
entitled
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
they're
not
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
on
the
other
hand,
they
do
get
preferred
treatment
under
the
child
nutrition
act.
they
get
preferred
treatment
under
the
food
stamp
act.
they
get
preferred
treatment
under
the
job
training
act.
it
would
not
be
unusual
for
them
to
get
different
treatment
here.
and
in
any
event,
it's
not
different
treatment
that
necessarily
places
them...
i
must
suggest...
on
some
preferred
status.
that
is,
they
suffer
under
a
great
many
other
disabilities.
when
in
1982,
after
eight
years
of
the
original
cause
of
action,
congress
held
hearings
on
how
things
were
going,
contrary
to
the
assertion
of
the
petitioner,
it
was
not
difficult
to
find
cases
where
migrants
were
maimed
despite
the
private
cause
of
action.
there
were
116
cases
listed
in
the
september
1982
hearings
involving
personal
injuries
resulting
from
unsafe
vehicles,
some
of
them
overturning
and
migrants
drowning
in
two
feet
of
water.
and
in
those
cases...
about
a
third
of
them
actually
involved
personal
injury
claims...
the
reason
the
conditions
continued
to
be
bad...
and
this
is,
i
think,
crucial
to
understand
what
compromise
was
struck
in
'82...
was
that
under
the
old
law
you
could
only
sue
the
crew
leader,
the
transient
crew
leader,
or
the
farm
labor
contractor.
you
couldn't
go
after
the
agribusiness,
the
ultimate
employer.
and
because
you
couldn't,
it
was
very
difficult
to
obtain
judgments,
and
exploitation
continued.
at
the
same
time,
the
ultimate
employers
felt
quite
hassled
by
being
demeaned,
they
thought...
by
being
treated
as
though
they
were
just
fly-by-night
crew
leaders
and
forced
to
register.
so
the
compromise
was,
we
won't
make
you
register,
but
we
will
subject
you,
as
defendants,
to
this
crucial
private
cause
of
action
which
senator
hatch
who
introduced
it
in
the
senate
said
was
vital
and
said
that
there
was
an
assurance
of
full
actual
damages
in
every
case.
at
the
same
time,
we'll
also
give
something--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no...
no.
it
would
have
had
to
have
occurred
while
you
were
being
transported
to
the
farm.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
on
the
farm--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the...
the
crew
leader
drove
one
of
those
trucks
where
those
kids
drowned,
justice
scalia.
but
the
truck's
seats
were
not
even
attached
to
the
truck,
and
it
belonged
to
the
ultimate
farmer.
the
farmers
in
these
cases,
the
growers,
would
often
hide
behind
the
crew
leaders.
they
would
supply
an
old
dilapidated
van
without
seat
belts,
with
equipment
that
wasn't
tied
down,
and
under
normal
principles
of
law,
one
would
be
able
to
sue
them
as
the
ultimately
responsible
parties.
but
under
flcra
one
couldn't
do
that.
so
that
congress
broadened
the
cause
of
action,
so
one
could
reach
the
responsible
source.
but
then,
in
addition
to
allowing
the
ultimate
agribusiness
not
to
have
to
register,
it
put
a
cap
on
statutory
damages
of
$500,000,
on
cumulative
statutory
damages
in
any
class
action.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
we
think
an
offset
would
make
perfect
sense.
so
did
judge
robert
vance
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
he
said
that...
and
this
is
the
way
it's
handled
in
many
other
areas,
like
longshoremen's
and
others...
he
said
that
it
is
perfectly
appropriate
for
the
district
court
in
deciding
what
actual
damages
were
suffered
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
they
had
collected
something
like
$120,000
among
the...
among
the...
i
think
ten
of
them...
from
the
workers'
compensation
board.
we're
not
suggesting
anything
like
the
double
dipping
or
double
recovery
that
petitioner
suggests.
but
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
when
congress
goes
out
of
its
way
to
empower
a
group
of
workers,
not
by
giving
them
cadillacs,
by
giving
them
access
to
federal
court,
and
when
congress
expressly
says
that
they
can
collect
damages
in
that
federal
court,
it
is
not
up
to
the
secretary
of
labor
in
a
pronouncement
about
a
part
of
a
statute
that
he
doesn't
administer,
to
rewrite
what
congress
did.
and
indeed,
you
know,
as
i
think
about
it,
this
court
is
being
asked
to
rewrite,
not
only
awpa,
but
the
dol
regulation
itself.
because
if
i
hear
her
correctly,
ms.
kneeland
is
now
retreating
from
the
position
of
her
original
brief,
and
she
is
now
saying
that,
well,
perhaps
you
shouldn't
really
reinstate
what
the
district
court
did.
you
should
cut
it
down
the
middle...
she
describes
it
in
terms
of
setting
the
pendulum
right...
and
what
you
should
do
is
allow
the
suit
for
statutory
damages,
which
could
still
by
the
way,
be
more
than
was
covered
by
insurance,
could
still
cripple
the
farmer,
which
leaves
very
little
sense
in
their
reading
of
1841(c).
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
he
could
certainly
buy
both.
there
is
nothing
in
this
law
that
would
lead
any
farmer--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
congress
perhaps
entrapped
farmers
into
buying
too
little
insurance
and
that,
therefore,
this
court
should
find
some
way
in
the
language
of
this
statute--
mr.
laurence

mr.
laurence

--the
trap
for
the
unwary
theory
doesn't
make
me
bleed
a
lot
when
the
damages
are
made
available
only
when
after
a
full
trial
you've
proven
intentional
violation
of
awpa.
we're
not
talking
about
liability
that
strikes
from
the
blue.
we're
not
talking
about
no-fault.
we're
not
even
talking
about
negligence.
moreover,
these
are
sophisticated
people.
i
mean
agribusiness...
i
simply
cannot
believe
that
they
thought
that
this
law
which
says
not
a
word
about
eliminating
the
federal
cause
of
action--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
seems
to
me
very
implausible
that
the
secretary
thought
it
said
that.
the
secretary
thought
it
gave
him
power
to
promulgate
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
in
'82--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--in
'82,
justice
scalia.
in
'74
when
the
cause
of
action
was
put
in
place,
there
was
an
interesting
colloquy
between
the
head
of
wages
and
hours
in
labor
and
representative
ford,
essentially
the
patron
saint
of
the
migrant
worker
community
in
congress
since
1974,
in
which
the
department
of
labor
was
asked,
aren't
you
better
off
with
this
private
cause
of
action.
doesn't
it
take
some
of
the
burden
off
of
you?
and
at
that
point
landis
said,
you
know,
i
guess
you're
right.
there's
no
reason
for
labor
to
resist
having
this
private
cause
of
action.
it
does
make
it
somewhat
mysterious
why
the
regulation
was
promulgated,
but
not
so
mysterious
why
the
solicitor
general
is
not
here
and
why
the
department
of
labor
hasn't
defended
this
provision.
that
is,
this
is
not
something
that
relates
to
the
labor
department's
responsibilities.
if
this
regulation
is
disregarded
as
obviously
ultra
vires,
it
doesn't
interfere
with
any
day-to-day
responsibility
of
the
department
of
labor.
it
doesn't
increase
their
burdens
one
bit.
it
simply
carries
out
what
congress
chose
to
do.
and
in
this
statute,
congress
was
very
specific
about
the
relationships
between
federal
and
state
law.
it
said
that
state
law
would
not
be
fully
preempted,
because
1871
says
that
states
can
add
responsibilities
on
top
of
the
federal.
it
specifically
absorbed
one
defense
from
state
law.
namely,
if
you're
defined
as
a
labor
organization
under
state
law,
then
you
can't
be
sued
under
this
private
cause
of
action.
in
addition
to
that,
it
empowers
the
secretary
to
delegate
administrative
functions
to
state
agencies
in
section
1863.
but
it
says
that
the
secretary
of
labor
shall
not
delegate
rule-making
authority.
in
other
words,
awpa
clearly
spells
out
a
certain
model
of
cooperative
federalism.
and
that
model
bears
no
resemblance
to
the
wholesale
absorption
of
state
law
which
is
accomplished
by
this
regulation.
and
you
notice
not
only
is
the
solicitor
general
not
here,
the
state
of
florida
is
not
here.
florida,
like
other
states,
does
not
purport
to
treat
the
exclusivity
of
workers'
comp
as
bearing
on
your
right
to
recover
from
another
legal
system.
that
was
the
holding
of
a
supreme
court
of
florida
in
1970.
and
this
court,
in
the
context
of
the
full
faith
in
credit
clause,
reached
a
similar
conclusion
in
thomas
v.
washington
gas
light
in
1980.
that
is
perhaps
why
the
states
of
texas,
california
and
massachusetts,
which
are
the
only
states
this
court
has
heard
from,
have
basically
taken
the
position
that
what
the
secretary
of
labor
did
was
to
create
a
kind
of
hybrid
chimerical
contraption
which
had
no
resemblance
to
what
the
states
wanted
to,
and
which
in
fact
hijacked
the
states'
laws,
turned
them
to
a
purpose
the
states
didn't
have
in
mind.
they
weren't
trying
to
kick
people
out
of
federal
court.
so
the
current
posture
this
court
is
asked
to
accept
far
from
a
perfect
position
of
a
pendulum,
involves
righting
a
very
strange
hybrid
law,
that
would
not
be
recognized
as
florida's
choice,
or
as
congress'
choice
or
perhaps
even
as
the
choice
of
the
current
secretary
of
labor,
which
it
seems
to
me
is
not
a
federal
judicial
responsibility.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
that
theory--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--if
that
were
an
appropriate
policy
objective
for
a
court
to
pursue
in
construing
a
statute,
i
suppose
one
would
have
to
think
about
that
harder.
but
as
i
have
thought
about
it
so
far,
i
think
it
cuts
the
other
way.
their
examples
in
the
first
two
footnotes
of
their
reply
brief
where
they
talk
about
texas
and
florida,
somehow
suggest
that
states
really
are
going
to
be
pressured
one
way
or
the
other
by
the
change.
but
the
fact
is
that
texas,
which
they
give
as
their
initial
example,
has
come
before
this
court
in
its
amicus
brief
to
say
that
it
wants
to
have
the
supplementary
availability
of
federal
relief
for
migrant
workers.
now,
of
course,
if
the
federal
relief
is
withdrawn...
the
relief
that
congress
provided...
states
might
be
under
pressure
to
do
all
sorts
of
things.
but
that
would
be
a
reason
to
cut
back
for
the
secretary.
suppose
the
secretary
of
labor
said,
i
think
workers'
comp
is
great.
i
want
to
pressure
states
to
provide
it.
so
i
say
that
if
it's
a
small
farm
that's
the
defendant,
and
if
the
migrants
are
not
hurt
beyond
a
level
of
$20,000,
and
i'll
set
that
as
a
minimum,
the
federal
cause
of
action
should
be
eliminated.
that
would
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
the
states.
but
it
would
surely
be
beyond
his
authority
and
it
would
not
be
consistent
with
this
law.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
suppose
it
would.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
think
i'll--
