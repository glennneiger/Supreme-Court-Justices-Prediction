justice
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
receipt
of
workman's
compensation
benefits
under
state
law
does
not
preempt
actions
under
the
agricultural
workers
protection
act.
we,
therefore,
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
