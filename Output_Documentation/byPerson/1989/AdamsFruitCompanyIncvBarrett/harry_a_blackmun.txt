i
get
a
question
in?
justice
harry

blackmun
the
solicitor
general
has
not
filed
a
brief
amicus
in
this
case,
has
he?
justice

a.
blackmun

that
rather
strange
that
he
isn't
in
here
defending
the
regulation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
i
know
that,
but--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--it's
his
regulation
that's
under
fire
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun

i
take
it
you
are
defending
the
regulation.
justice
harry
a.
