justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
may
i
ask--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
on
the...
say
they
had
a
policy
of
insurance...
they
insured
for
$50,000,
say,
and
the
employee
had
a
$60,000
claim.
would
the
employee
be
limited
to
amount
of
the
policy
limits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
statute
doesn't
require
that,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well...
the
secretary's
regulations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
the
claim
then
was
for
$110,000?
could...
would
there...
would
he
be
limited
to
the
amount
that
the
insurance...
the
required
insurance
coverage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's...
that's
right,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
workmen's
compensation,
supposing
he
got...
the
workmen's
compensation
recovery
was
equal
to
what
the
insurance
would
have
been
if
the
employer
had
to
have
insurance,
but
since
he's
got
workmen's
comp
he
doesn't
need
the
insurance.
why
can't
he
get
more
in
one
context
if
he
can
in
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
they
can
get
above
and
beyond
the
liability
policy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
would
you
think
the
farmer
believes
that
if
he
buys
a
$100,000
policy,
that...
that's
the
extent
that
he
can
possibly
be
liable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tribe,
it
is
true,
though,
is
it
not,
that
the
available...
if
you
get
workmen's
compensation
coverage,
you
don't
have
to
have
any
insurance
coverage?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
federal
workmen's
compensation
coverage
in
a
particular
case
might
provide
a
recovery
of
much
less
than
the
limits
the
secretary
would
otherwise
provide?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
at
that
extent,
the
availability
of
the
state
remedy
cuts
back
on
some
of
the
federal
protection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
is
part
of
the
secretary's
responsibility
to
decide
how
much
insurance
people
have
to
carry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
think...
isn't
also
true
that
the
secretary
has
to
confront
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
farmers
may
not
be
solvent
enough
to
pay
these
very
large
judgments,
and
that
it
really
in
term...
practical
terms
is
trying
to
figure
out
how
best
to
get
the
money
to
the
injured
people,
and
that
figuring
in
the
normal
case,
insurance
coverage
would
be...
would
be
the
answer
or
workmen's
comp.--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there's
this...
when
you
say
rewriting
what
congress
did,
of
course,
the
question
is
what
did...
what
did
congress
do.
is
it
not...
from
the
farmer's
point
of
view,
is
it
not
possible
to
look
at
the
whole
package
and
say,
well,
they
want
me
to
protect
these
people
by
buying
insurance.
it
have
two
choices.
i
can
either
buy
ordinary
insurance,
in
which
event
i
am
liable
if
the...
if
the
policy
is
not
large
enough.
or
i
can
buy
workmen's
comp
insurance
in
which,
if
it's
like
it
normally
is,
that
will
give
me
full
protection.
wouldn't
the...
wouldn't
the
farmer
think
that
was
his
choice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
they
don't
want
to
have
spend
any
more
money
than
they
have
to,
obviously.
and
if
they
think
the
workmen's
compensation
will
(a)
be
the
better
remedy
for
the
worker
and
also
less
expensive
than
buying
both,
it
seems
to
me
its
a
possible
interpretation
of
what
of
congress
but
together.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
don't
like
to
construe--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--we
do
not
like
to
construe
the
statutes
as
traps
for
people
who
didn't
really
fully
understand
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
cannot
believe
they
thought
it
said
what
the
secretary
thought
it
said.
