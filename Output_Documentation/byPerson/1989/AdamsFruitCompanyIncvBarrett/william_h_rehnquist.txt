chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-2035,
adams
fruit
company
v.
ramsford
barrett.
ms.
kneeland.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--are
you
saying
there
should
be
some
sort
of
a
set-off
for
recovery
in
the
other
procedure
or
just
that
one
completely
precludes
the
other
insofar
as
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
you...
you
mean...
the
workmen...
that
florida
workmen's
compensation
is
included
in...
in
awpa?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean?
it's...
it's
a--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
what
about
1854(c)
or...
you
know--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
it
says
expressly
that
you
shall
have
a
private
right
of
action
and
that
a
court
who
finds
an
intentional
violation
can
award
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
it
really
is
quite
extraordinary
that
it
would
go
ahead
and
say
that
the
court...
not
a
commission,
but
a
court
can
award
damages.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when...
when
was
1841
put
in
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
1841
came
into
the
statute
in
1983
and
1854
came
in
1974?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
meaning
is
fairly
clear,
of
actual
damages.
it
suggests
no
punitive
damages,
but,
you
know,
pain
and
suffering,
doctor
bills
and
the
loss
of
income.
that
sort
of
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
kneeland,
your
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
mr.
tribe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
an
offset,
mr.
tribe?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-2035,
adams
fruit
company
versus
barrett
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
