--where
do
we
find
that?
whereabouts?
would
you
give
us--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
there
a
brief
where
we--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--can
refer
to
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
miss
kneeland,
i
thought--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
thought
this
section
only
dealt
with
whether
the
employer
had
to
have
an
insurance
policy
or
liability
bond?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
find
other
language
in
it
that
deals
with
something
other
than
whether
the
employer
has
to
furnish
an
insurance
policy
or
a
liability
bond?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
kneeland,
as
a
practical
matter,
how
much
would
premiums
escalate
to
provide
this
additional
coverage,
assuming
there's
an
offset
given
in
the
remedy--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
there
is
a
federal
cause
of
action
for
bodily
damages
and
assuming
you
get
an
offset
for
whatever
the
state
workmen's
comp
provided?
do
you
think
we
are
talking
about
some
enormous
increase
in
premium
cost?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--double--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--when
you
have
an
offset?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
tribe,
why...
why
do
you
think
congress
adopted
this
insurance
liability
provision?
it
is--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--yes.
it
is
curious
because
it
isn't
a
good
fit
under
your
theory.
