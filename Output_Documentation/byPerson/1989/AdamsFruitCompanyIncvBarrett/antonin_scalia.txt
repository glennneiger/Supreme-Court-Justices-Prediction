justice
antonin
scalia
do
you...
do
you
say
that
that
only
applies
to
automobile
accidents?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
section
entitled
motor
vehicle
safety?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that...
that's
where
congress
would
choose
to
express
the...
the
general
principle
that
its
monetary
remedies
are
supplanted
across
the
board
by
state
workmen's
compensation?
in
a
section
entitled
motor
vehicle
safety?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
is
wonderful,
but
we're
just...
we're
not
debating
that.
we're
just
debating
whether
it's
been
provided
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's...
that's
a
very
good
policy
perhaps,
but
has
it
been
provided?
do
you
think...
do
you
think,
ms.
kneeland,
that...
that
it
is
possible
for
congress
to
make
a
mistake?
does
congress
ever
make
a
mistake?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
because
i...
i
really
can't
figure
out
why
they
would
want
to
put
an
insurance
limit,
and
say
don't...
so
long
as
you
have
insurance
up
to
the
amount
of
your
workmen's
comp,--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
okay.
i
can't
see
why
else
they
might
want
to
do
it
except
the
reason
you're
giving.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
fact
is
that
they
have
done
nothing
in
the
statute
except
to
say
that
you
have
to
have
insurance.
now,
maybe
they
had
something
else
in
mind,
but
it
seems
to
me
they
didn't
do
it.
which
is
why
i
ask
whether
you
are
willing
to
concede
that
sometimes
congress
does
not
achieve
what
it...
what
it
meant
to
achieve.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
should
have
gotten
a
good
draftsman,
is
what
they
should
have
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
business
is
it
of
the
secretary?
i
mean,
usually
the
secretary
issues
regulation
for
matters
in
which
he
has
a
responsibility.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
responsibility
does
the
secretary
have
in
this
field
to
go
around
pronouncing
who
can
sue
in
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
regulations,
i
assume,
governing
the
individuals
who
were
subject
to
the
act
and
governing
the
officials
of
the
department
of
labor
who
implement
the
act.
but
regulations
governing
the
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
the
courts.
the
remedies
are
judicial
remedies
and
he's
issuing
a
regulation
saying
the
court
shall
provide
no
remedy
when
there
is
workmen's
comp.
that's
what
the
regulation
reads,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
not
arguing
about
the
scope
of
it
right
now.
i'm...
i'm
just...
just
questioning
what
business
the
secretary
had
to
stick
his
nose
into
this
matter.
we
defer
to
the
secretary's
regulations
within
the
scope
of
his
responsibility.
but
how
is
it
the
scope
of
his
responsibility
to
say
what
lawsuits
the
courts
will
entertain?
which
is
what
the
regulation
does,
does
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
effectively
says
you
can't
bring
a
suit
in
court,
if
you
have
workmen's
comp.--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay,
fine.
ms.
kneeland--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
right,
but
you're
not
answering
my
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
move
to
enforce
the
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
would
they...
how
would
they
move
to
enforce
the
regulation
if
they
wanted
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
tribe,
could
i
ask
about
that?
the
petitioner's
reply
brief
says
that
that
provision
was
just
like
this
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
shall
conform
with
it?
the
insurance?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i...
i
think
that's
significant,
that
every...
i'm
sorry,
you
haven't
answered
justice
o'connor.
why
don't
you
finish
with
justice
o'connor's
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
tribe,
you...
you
must
admit
the
result
that's
produced
is
counterintuitive
at
a
minimum.
you're
talking
about
workers
who
had
been
disadvantaged
workers.
they
had
been
sort
of
treated
as
second-class
workers,
migrants.
they
now
are
in
a
preferred
position.
had...
had
this
same
accident
on
this
farm
occurred
to
some
of
the
resident
farm
hands,
their
only
remedy
would
have
been
the
state
workmen's
compensation.
and
now
this
bill,
which
one
would
have
thought
was
at
most
intended
to
eliminate
the
disabilities
that
migrants
had
been
suffering,
places
them
in
a
preferred
position.
they
can
go
into
federal
courts
for
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
we...
we
don't
care
about
the
resident
farm
hands?
justice
antonin
scalia
workmen's
comp
is
okay
for
them
but
the...
but
the
migrants
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this
cadillac
treatment
in
federal
courts.
i
think
it's...
it's
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me,
you...
you
don't
get
the...
if...
if
there's
an...
that
accident
you
began
your
presentation
with,
was
that
an
accident
that
had
occurred
on
a
farm
or
was
that
an
accident
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
by
a
crew
leader.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
a
crew
leader,
not
by
a
private
farmer.
and...
and
most
of
the
other
instances
you
just
mentioned
as
to
how
many
there
were,
what
percentage
of
those
were...
were
trucks
that
were
being
driven
by
the
crew
leaders,
as
opposed
to
on
the
farm
of
the
individual?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
secretary,
it
should
be
added,
was
the
moving
force
behind
this
legislation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--this...
this
was
the
department's
bill.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
those
states
that
now
do
not
provide
workmen's
comp
coverage
for
migrant
workers
to
do
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
has
some
advantages
to
migrant
workers
beyond...
beyond
this...
this
field
we're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i...
i
suggest
it
just
as
an
explanation
of
what
congress
perhaps
had
in
mind,
not
that
the
secretary
could
achieve
it.
but
it
would
be...
it
would
be
an
intelligent
objective
of
congress.
