mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
an
auto
accident
in
which
a
group
of
migrant
workers
who
were
being
transported
to
the
fields,
at
which
time
the
van
in
which
they
were
being
transported
tipped
over
because
a
tire
blew
and
they
were
injured.
the
workers
were
compensated
through
workers'
compensation
benefits.
however,
after
that
point,
they
also
brought
suit
against
the
employer
based
on
allegations
that
the
employer
had
violated
safety
provisions
in
the
migrant
seasonal
agricultural
worker
protection
act,
which
is
sometimes
known
as
msawpa
or
awpa.
since
the
court
below
used
the
term
awpa,
that
is
the
one
i
will
use.
the
awpa
violations,
as
to
the
infractions
that
allegedly
caused
body...
bodily
injury
were
never
proved
because
the
case
was
resolved
in
the
middle
district
of
florida
by
way
of
a...
a
partial
summary
judgment.
the
middle
district
of
florida,
looking
at
the
incorporation
or
the
addition
of
the
workers'
compensation
remedy
into
the
act
and
the
department
of
labor's
regulation
making
that
the
exclusive
remedy
in
cases
of
bodily
injury,
the...
the
middle
district
gave
a
summary
judgment
to
adams
fruit
on
those
bodily
injury
claims,
as
well
as
the
claims
for
statutory
fines
and
injunctive
relief
in
that
area.
what
the
middle
district
did
then
is
swing
the
pendulum
in
one
direction
completely.
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
the
eleventh
circuit
swung
the
pendulum
back
completely
in
another
direction
and
reinstated
everything
to
the
migrant
workers,
not
simply
entitlement
to
sue
under
the
statute
to
enforce
the
safety
provisions
by
way
of
penalties
or
injunctive
relief,
but
also
to
make
workers'
compensation
only
the
first
step
in
a
two-step
process
where
they
could
stack
a
liability
claim
for
bodily
injury
damages
under
the
act
above
and
beyond
the
workers'
compensation
relief.
and
we
are
here
today
to
argue
the
narrow
issue
that
perhaps
both
courts
swung
too
far
in
either
direction,
and
this
court
should
make
the
pendulum
right
again.
the
narrow
issue,
as
i
said,
is
that
when
workers'
compensation
is
provided,
as
set
up
by
the
act
itself,
whether
awpa
intended
to
operate
workers'
compensation
as
it
normally
would
operate,
as
a
no-fault
recovery,
in
return
for
being
the
exclusive
remedy
for
bodily
injury
claims...
bi
claims
or
death.
our
position
in
this
court
is
that
we
are
not
advocating
to
this
court
that
the
migrant
workers
may
not
sue
to
get
penalties
or
injunctive
relief
under
the
statute.
we
are
simply
saying
that
the
bodily
injury
claims
were
recovered
by
way
of
workers'
compensation
and
that
is
not
part
of
a
two-step
remedy
that
can
be
stacked.
although
the
eleventh
circuit
framers--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--yes?
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
what
we
are
saying,
as
far
as
bodily
injury
claims
alone...
these
are
claims
for
medicals,
and
lost
wages
and
that...
that
which
is
in
the
field
of
bodily
injury
or
actual
damages...
that
is
taken
care
of
by
the
alternate
remedy
which
is
included
in
the
statute
of
workers'
compensation.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
yes,
it
is.
state
workers'
compensation
is
included
in
awpa.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
it
just
says
state,
any
state.
actually,
specifically
it's
section
1841
which
deals
with
the
cases
of
bodily
injury
or
death
for
workers
in
transit,
as
happened
in
this
case.
in
section
1841,
the
insurance
plans--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--1841(c),
in--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--yes.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
actually
set
out
in
full
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
the
appendix.
however,
it
would
also
be
here
in
the
brief
of
the
petitioner.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
32(a)
in
the
appendix?
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
yes,
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
and
1841(c)
is
the
only
part
of
the
statute
that
refers
to
cases
of
bodily
injury
or
death.
in
fact,
it
says...
and
i
am
paraphrasing,
you
can
read
along
with
me.
the
section
beforehand
requires
that
you
have
to
have
a
liability
bond
for
workers
in
transit.
however,
1841(c)
states
that
in
cases
of
bodily
injury
or
death,
that
if
an
employer
employs
migrant
and
seasonal
workers
under
state
workers'
compensation
law,
and
the
employer
does
provide
workers'...
coverage
in
the
case
of
bodily
injury
or
death,
then
no
liability
policy
is
required
if
the
workers
have
that
coverage.
on
the
other
hand,--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--what
we
are
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
that
was
the
logical
place
to
insert
it
into
the
statute--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--yes,
your
honor.
because
that--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--well,
your
honor,
that
was,
at
the
time,
the
major
concern
of
the
legislature,
the
department
of
labor
and
the
others
who
discussed
this,
that
they
wanted
to
make
sure
that
these
workers
who
are
in
transit,
because
migrant...
migratory...
most
of
the
accident
were
occurring...
and
there
is
a
national
safety
council
cited
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
american
farm
bureau
which
is
the
citation
for
this.
most
of
the
injuries--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--most
of
the
injuries
occurred
in--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--well,
your
honor,
that
section--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--well,
your
honor,
the
language
in
this
statute
refers
to
bodily
injury
claims.
what
it
does
is
allow
the
substitution
of
a
workers'
compensation
remedy
for
the
remedy
of
a
liability
policy.
and
it
seems
to
make
no
sense...
there
would
be
no
other
reason
for
the
statute
to
allow
the
substitution
of
that
remedy
for
the
liability
policy
unless
it
was
meant
to
be
the
comparable.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
yes?
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
yes,
your
honor.
1854(c)
sets
out
a
private
right
of
action
for
actual
damages
or
statutory
finds
or
injunctive
relief.
and
what
we
are
saying
is
that
private
right
of
action
is
not
destroyed
by
our
position.
our
position
is
simply
that
the
legislature,
the
department
of
labor,
the
drafters
of
the
statute,
allowed
for
an
alternative
form
of
obtaining
bodily
injury
damages
through
workers'
compensation.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
yes,
your
honor.
because
if
there
were
no
workers'
compensation
remedy
permitted,
the
worker
would
have
to
get
a
liability
bond
or
a
liability
policy
instead--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--did
i
say
employee?
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
i'm
sorry.
the
employer
would
have
to
obtain
a
liability
policy
or
bond.
in
which
case,
the
worker,
instead
of
getting
the
superior
remedy
of
workers'
compensation,
immediate
recovery,
and
not
having
the
burden
of
proving
a
violation
or
that
his
injuries
were
caused
by
a
violation,
would
have
his
workers'
compensation
remedy--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--whereas--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
policy
limits
are
100,
300,
or
100,
500--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--yes,
the
regulations
do.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
there's
a
regulation,
and
i'll
get
to
that
too.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
no,
your
honor.
but
in
such
case,
he
would
have
to
go
to
court
and
prove
to
a
court
of
law
that
he
is
entitled
anything
at
all,
even
the
first
penny.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
yes.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
well,
your
honor,
it
would
make
no
sense
for
this
reason.
if...
if
the
drafters
had
intended
him
to
get
above
and
beyond
workers'
compensation,
they
would
certainly
have
never
permitted
farmers
to
drop
their
liability
policies.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
what
they
have
done
is
given
the
farmers
an
alternative
and,
even
in
the
house
report,
stated
to
the
farmer,
this
is
all
that
is
necessary,
certainly
leading
every
farmer
to
believe
that
if
he
did
purchase
a
workers'
compensation
policy,
that
would
be
a
sufficient
remedy,
since
workers'
compensation
could
go
on
and
on--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--no,
your
honor.
but
the
act,
i
believe,
was
meant
to
encourage
workers
to...
otherwise
why
would
it
be
included
+/?
to
encourage
the
employers
to
include
workers'
compensation
and
elect
to
include
it
in...
in
states
where
it
is
elected...
elective...
and
not
to
oppose
the
legislature
in
states
where
it
is
not
elective
or
it
is
mandatory,
because
it
is
a
far
superior
remedy.
as
arthur
larson
pointed
out
in
his
very
scathing
review
of
the
eleventh
circuit
case
below,
workers'
compensation
is
not
a
remedy
that
you
pick
apart
and
you
offer
only
the
best
part
of
it,
and
you
take
away
the
other
part.
it's
a
remedy
that
has
two
sides
to
it,
as
though
it's
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
and
one
is
that
there
is
unlimited
workers'
compensation
for
the
person
who
needs
it.
it
goes
on
and
on
and
on
for
what
they
need,
until...
until
it's
determined
by
the
workers'
compensation
law
that
they
no
longer
need
it.
it
is
immediate.
they
don't
have
to
prove,
in
this
case,
that
the
employer
violated
anything,
or
that
the
violations
led
to
an
injury.
they
get
it
immediately,
and
they
get
it
across
the
board
for
any
job-related
injury
in
this
case.
it's
a
far
broader
and
better
remedy.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
well--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--congress
can
make
a
mistake,
your
honor.
but,
also,
congress--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--well,
this
bill
was
drafted--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--your
honor,
this--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--well,
i
would
say
this.
sometimes
congress
can
leave
a
statute
with
blanks.
sometimes
congress
can
leave
ambiguities
in
the
statute,
in
which
case,
and
in
this
case,
this
was
an
administrative
bill,
drafted
and
overseen
by
the
department
of
labor
who
got
the
parties
together,
worked
with
them
through
the
negotiations
for
18
months
on
a
daily
basis--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--well,
your
honor,
these
are
drafted
by
committees
and
groups
that
got
together
to
try
to
form
a
consensus
bill
to
please
everyone--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--well,
your
honor,
in
this
case
the...
the
language
of
the
statute
is...
is
perhaps
ambiguous,
in
which
case,
you
would
defer
to
the
department
of
labor's
contemporaneous
regulations,
which
were
passed
to...
which
were
passed
to
regulate
and
administer
this
bill.
and
in
this
case,
the
department
of
labor,
which...
this
was
a
department
of
labor
bill...
oversaw
everything,
worked
with
the
parties
for
18
months
before
they
gave
birth
to
this
bill,
which
was
a
very
long
gestation
period
by
any
means.
and
included
for
bodily
injury
and
death
a
substitute
remedy
which...
which
brought
in,
leveraged
in,
workers'
compensation
for
migrant
workers
for
anything
now...
falling
off
the
ladder,
being
plain
old
klutzy,
whatever...
brought
this
protection
into
the
act
for
them.
and...
and
perhaps
should
have,
but
did
not,
go
back
to
1854
and
modify
some
language.
well,
your
honor,
the
language
in
the...
in
1854
was
put
in
in
1974
with
no
comment.
never...
actual
damages
was
never
defined.
when
it
was
discussed
by
anyone
in
the
legislative
history,
it
was
discussed
in
the
context
of
recordkeeping
violations,
housing
standard
violations,
never
in
the
context
of
bodily
injury
claims.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
oh,
all
right.
well,
what
happen
was
flcra
was...
that's
the
farm
labor
contractor
registration
act...
was
universally
hated
and
repealed,
and
awpa
was
put
in.
it
was...
i
believe...
it
was
passed
in
december
of
'82
and
went
into
effect
in
april
of
'83.
it
was
a
brand
new
bill.
everyone
said
the
old
bill
didn't
work.
things
weren't
happening.
neither
side
was
getting
the
protections
that
were
necessary.
they
wanted
to
make
sure
everyone
was
more
fully
protected,
and
so
they
added
this
language
and
brought
in,
for
the
first
time,
workers'
compensation
as
an
alternate
remedy.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
by
a
different...
it
was
in
a
different
bill
and
under
a
different...
probably
section
or
provision
number.
but
back
in
1974,
the
house
and
senate
reports
both
refer
to
only
statutory
fines
and
equitable
relief,
nothing
about
actual
damages.
and
then
somewhere
along
the
line...
and
its
not
really
clear
where...
the
term
actual
damages
was
added
before
it
was
passed.
and
it
was
with
no
discussion;
it
was
just
added
at
that
time.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
you
would
need
that
language
because
in
many
cases
the
farmer
is
not
either
required
to
provide
comp
by
state
law
or
he
doesn't
elect
to
provide
comp,
in
which
case
he
would
only
have
a
liability
policy
and
the
farmer
would
have
to...
excuse
me,
the
farm
employee
would
have
to
go
to
court
and
bring
suit
for
these
actual
damages.
so
it's
necessary
that
that
language
is
left
within
the
statute
for
that
purpose.
but
we
are
also
saying
that
the
regulation
drafted
by
the
department
of
labor,
which
specifically
states
where
a
state
workers'
compensation
law
is
applicable
and
coverage
is
provided
for
migrant
and
seasonal
workers
by
the
employer,
workers'
compensation
benefits
are
the
exclusive
remedy
for
loss
under
this
act
in
the
case
of
bodily
injury
or
death.
in
other
words,
the
regulation
is
very
specific
that
it
is
only
in
the
case
of
loss
for
bodily
injury
or
death
that
workers'
compensation
would
be
exclusive--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--yes.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
well,
your
honor,
in
the...
in
the
first
place,
he
was
given,
under
several
sections
of
the
statute...
and
they
are
1861,
which
is
to
promulgate
rules
and
regulations
over
the
entire
statute,
and
1841(d)
specifically
for
safety...
health
and
safety
of
the
migrant
workers,
particularly
in
cases
like
this
where
you
have
workers
in
transit...
was
given
the
authority
to
draft
regulations
in
order
to
administer
this
statute.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
oh,
no,
your
honor.
not
regulations
governing
the
courts,
but
regulations
governing
the
remedies
that
were
provided
by
the
statute--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--no,
your
honor.
the
court
says
there
is
no
remedy
for
actual
damages
or
actually
bodily
injury
or
death
damages.
the
worker
can
still...
and
this
is
were
i
feel
both
courts
erred
in
not
seeing
what
the...
what
the
actual
plan
was
in
the
dovetailing
of
workers'
compensation
was...
was
that
for
bodily
injury
claims,
workers'
compensation
was
the
alternative
provided
to
the
worker.
in
cases
where
they
wanted
to
seek
through
the
courts
additional
remedies,
there
is
still
equitable
relief
or
statutory
penalties.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
well,
your
honor--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--no,
your
honor.
it
said
you
can't
bring
a
suit
in
court
for
your
bodily
injury
claim.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
all
right.
i...
i
may
not
be...
i
may
not
be
answering
your
question
completely,
so
i
will
try
again.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
the
statute...
if
the
statute
is
silent
or
ambiguous
on
this
issue,
then
the
department
of
labor
regulation
may
fill
the
gap.
and
since
they
were
there
and
they
were
the
ones
that
pushed
this
bill
through
and
got
the
people
together
and
were
involved
all
of
the
way,
you
would...
you
would
see
that
by
adding
workers'
compensation,
which
is
understood
by
everyone
to

ms.

kneeland
--all
right.
i'll
try
again.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
yes.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
no,
your
honor.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
well,
your
honor,
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
department
of
labor
is
a
party
to
the
suit.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
and...
yes...
and
your
honor--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--yes,
your
honor.
and
the
department
of
labor
has
never
attempted
to
withdraw
this
regulation
in
all
this
time,
nor
have
they
been
challenged
to
do
so
until
this
time.
the
adams
fruit
opinion
came
out
ten
months
ago,
and
the
department
of
labor
has
not
made
any
move
to
withdraw
its
regulation.
they
have
stood
by
their
regulation
this
entire
time,
and
they
may
believe
that
their
regulation
is
certainly
being
adequately
and
extremely
well
defended
today.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
yes.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
your
honor,
there
may
be
reasons
why
they
have
not
come
in
that
i
am
not
aware
of,
but
that
would
be
outside
of
this
record.
as
far
as
i
know,
they
have
made
no
move
in
any
way
to
withdraw
the
regulation
in
all
of
this
time
or
to
indicate
in
any
way
that
they
no
longer
stand
by
this
regulation.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
as...
as
far
as
i
know.
i...
i
don't
know
that
there
have
been
any
actions
in
that
regard
as
well
where
they
privately--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--i'm
not
sure
i
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
would
have
to...
i...
i'm
afraid
i
don't
know.
i
would
have
to
look
through
the
statute
again
and
see
if
there
is
some
way
that
they
could
move
to
enforce
their
own
regulation
in
the
courts.
i'm
not
certain.
i
would
try...
i
would
like
to
try
to
answer
the
question
that
i
was
unsuccessful
in
answering
the
first
time.
okay?
the...
the
argument
that
the
other
side
appears
to
make
is
that
the
department
of
labor
tried
to
sneak
this
regulation
through
and
that
no
one
noticed
it.
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
this
was
such
an
important
aspect
of
this
statute
to
the
migrant
worker
groups,
that
they
certainly
would
have
taken
note
of
this
regulation
when
it
first
came
out
and
was
published
in
summary
form
in
april
of
1983
and
also
where
it
was
published
in
what
would
be
its
interim
form
and
comments
were
requested
for
30
days.
there
were...
according
to
the
august
1983
federal
register,
there
was
no
opposition
recorded
or
no
comments
about
it
to
the...
to
the
extent
that
it
was
incorrect.
and
now...
all
along
for
18
months
migrant
workers'
groups
were
actively
involved
in
the
drafting
of
the
statute
and
actively
there
for
every
step
of
the
way
as
it
was
brought
together.
it
would
appear
that
and...
and
if
this
was
an
error
on
the
department
of
labor's
part,
or
something
beyond
the
scope
of
what
they
were
entitled
to
do,
that
would
have
certainly
raised
a...
a
tremendous
surge
of
opposition.
in
fact,
this
regulation
has
been
on
the
books
for
nearly
seven
years,
and
it
is
only
recently
that
someone
has
challenged
it.
i'm
sorry...
i
take
that
back.
the...
the
actual
regulation
has
only
been
challenged
once,
but
there
is
one
other
case,
the
roman
case,
where
actual
damages
where
attempted
to
be
recovered
in
addition
to
workers'
compensation.
what...
what
we're
trying
to
say
here
is
that
the...
the
drafters
had
a
purpose
for
putting
workers'
compensation
in
as
an
alterative.
and
it
certainly
would
not
have
been
telling
the
farmers
that
they
can
drop
their
liability
policies
and
count
on
their
workers'
compensation
because
i
don't
believe
they
would
have
meant
to
hang
the
farmer
out
to
dry
like
that.
they
certainly,
if
they
were...
if
this
was
meant
to
afford
additional
protections
to
the
migrant
worker
above
and
beyond
workers'
compensation,
they
could
have
required
comp,
if
it's
available,
and
a
liability
policy
above
and
beyond
that
to
compensate
the
workers
for
additional
damages
if
they
brought
claims
for
actual
damages
through
the
court.
however,
these
workers
are
not
deprived
of
their
remedy
under
1854.
they
can
sue
to
enforce
the
statute.
and
if
that
means
equitable
relief
or
penalties,
then...
then
so
be
it.
it
is
where
we
come
to
bodily
injury
claims
that
it
is
obvious
that
a
group
of
people
who
got
together
and
who
in...
in
flcra,
the
previous
bill,
had
never
permitted
the
substitution
of
workers'
compensation...
and
this
is
the
substitution
of
the
remedy...
determined
that
they
would
indeed
substitute
that
remedy.
and
what
we
have
now
are
workers,
migrant
workers,
who
are
compensated
across
the
board
immediately
for
their
injuries
in
all
phases
on
the
job,
anytime
they
are
hurt,
because
they
have
the
workers'
compensation
remedy
at
their
disposal.
well,
the
quid
pro
quo
of
that
is
that
the
farmer
wants
to
have
workers'
compensation
too.
he
wants
this
to
be
a
remedy,
an
alternate
remedy
obviously
under
awpa
because,
number
one,
he
would
not
be
brought
into
court
all
the
time.
even
if
he
proved
to
be
totally
void
of
committing
any
violations,
he
would
have
to
hire
an
attorney
and
go
to
court
and
so
on
and
so
forth,
and
we
have
what
amounts
to
a
federal
tort
suit
then,
above
and
beyond
every
workers'
compensations
claim.
we
have
19
states
where
the
employer
can
elect
workers'
compensation.
in,
i
believe
it's
15
of
the
states,
that's
part
of
the
statute,
and
in
four
other
states,
it
is
just
permitted.
nineteen
states
where
tomorrow
the
farm
employer
could
say,
well,
i
am
not
getting
anything
back
from
my
workers'
compensation
policies
and
paying
my
premiums.
i'm
going
to
have
to
go
out
now
and
purchase
a
liability
policy
in
addition,
even
though
i
have
been
told
that
this
is
all
we
needed.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
they
would--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--what
we're
talking
about,
your
honor,
is
double...
double
premiums,
one
in
a
workers'
compensation
arena
and
another
in
a
liability
arena.
and
many
of
the
migrant
workers
who...
excuse
me...
migrant
worker
employers
who
are
getting
both
will
feel
now
there
is
no
necessity
to
have
the
one,
since
they
can
just
get
the
other
if
they
are
going
to
be
sued
anyway.
they
probably
will
elect,
in
states
where
it's
elective,
elect
not
to
have
comp;
simply
get
a
liability
policy
that
will
cover
everything
and
pay
one
premium.
and
then
in
other
states
where
workers'
compensation
is
mandatory,
you
will
absolutely
have
pressure
from
the
farm
groups
on
the
legislature
to
say,
we
have
to
go
out
and
get
a
liability
policy
anyway.
economically,
we
would
be
paying
for
two
policies
just
because
this
is
mandatory
in
the
state.
let's...
let's...
give
us
the
election,
or
let's
drop
the
migrant
workers--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--i
don't
know--
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
--i
don't
know.
ms.
bonita
l.
kneeland
i
don't
know
that
offsets
are
ever
factored
in.
as
far
as
underwriting
insurance,
i
don't
know.
i
just
know
that
all
premiums
in
all
cases
now
are
escalating.
i've
seen
in
the
news...
it's
just...
it's
getting
to
be
a
greater
and
greater
problem.
but
what
we
would
like
to
say
is,
if
this
left,...
not
perhaps
eleventh
circuit
version
or
the
middle
district
version...
but
left
to
workers'
compensation
as
the
alternative
for
bodily
injury,
then
you
have
workers
who
are
so
much
better
protected
in
all
arenas
in
the
workplace,
all
areas.
and
you
would
not
have
the
pressure
brought
on
legislature,
such
as
florida,
to
eliminate
the
workers'
comp
requirement.
and
florida
eliminates
workers'
comp
requirements
whenever
pressure
is
brought
to
bear,
if
you
look
at
florida's
history.
right
now,
if
you
have
jones
act
coverage,
harbor
workers,
federal
employee
liability
act,
the
florida
compensation
statute
has
eliminated
workers'
compensation.
there
are
other
areas
where
it
has
done
similar
things.
your
honor...
honors,
we
would
say
that
the
superior
remedy--
