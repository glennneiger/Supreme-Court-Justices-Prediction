justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question?
if
this
case
had
arisen
prior
to
1924
when
your
client
was
not
an
american
citizen,
would
you
make
the
same
argument?
justice
stevens
but
is
that
true,
mr.
wilks,
if--
--justice
stevens
had
a
question
for
you,
mr.
wilks.
you're
too
fast
for
me,
mr.....
i
just
said
is
the
point
you're
making
valid
if
we...
first
of
all,
it
doesn't
apply
to
non-indian
residents
of
the
tribe,
in
other
words,
white...
white
american--
justice
stevens
--citizens
of
the
tribe.
and
with
respect
to
the
non-member
indian
residents,
two
questions.
is
the
problem
with
respect
to
them
any
different
than
it
is
with
the
non-indians
if
you
assume
that
there
would
be
state
jurisdiction
over
these
misdemeanors
under
the
mcbratney
line
of
reasoning?
justice
stevens
it,
itself,
did
some
manhandling.
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
the
gap
argument
that
you
make
is
really
the
same
gap
argument
that
the
government
made
in
oliphant.
justice
stevens
and
it
may
or
may
not
have
been
valid.
it
depends
on
how
one
anticipates
the
state
jurisdiction
might
fill
this
void.
justice
stevens
i
know
not
under
public
law
280,
that's
right,
but
under
the
line
of
reasoning
that
applied
in
mcbratney.
justice
stevens
mr.
wallace,
can
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment
on
the
rogers
case?
at
that
time
in
1846
when
the
court
talked
about
the
family
of
indians
including
both
members
and
non-members,
all
of
the
members
of
that
family
shared
the
characteristic
of
noncitizenship--
justice
stevens
--which
is
no
longer
true.
does
that
make
a
difference,
do
you
think?
because
now
the
family
of
indians,
if
you
construe
it
broadly,
includes
those
who
have
the
benefit
of
american
citizenship
as
well
as
those
who
do
not.
justice
stevens
but
it
makes
this
difference,
doesn't
it?
at
that
time
there
would
have
been
no
differential
treatment
between
the
litigant
in
this
case
and
other
citizens,
whereas
now,
in
order
to
sustain
your
position,
you
must
say
some
citizens
are
treated
differently
than
other
citizens.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
rationale
was
that
they
were...
there
were
characteristics
which
differentiated
them
from
other
citizens;
namely,
their
indian
status:
but
that
isn't
true
here.
