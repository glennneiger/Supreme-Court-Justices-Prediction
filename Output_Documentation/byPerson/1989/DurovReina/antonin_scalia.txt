justice
scalia
couldn't
one
say
that
what
indians,
what
all
indians
meant
in...
at
the
time
1152
was
adopted
is
not
necessarily
what
all
indians
means
today;
that
in
light
of
the
later
legislation
providing
for
enrollment
and
so
forth,
who
constitutes
an
indian
has
simply
been
changed?
that
would
solve
that
problem,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
on
any
theory,
you...
you
would
still
say...
when
you
say
it
means
a
member
of
the
tribe,
you
assert
an
enrolled
member
of
the
tribe,
don't
you?
isn't
that
what
you
mean
by
a
member
of
the
tribe?
justice
scalia
not
necessarily.
well,
then
you're...
then
you're
into
the
gap
again.
then
you're
into
the
gap
again.
if
it
includes
not
only
enrolled
members
of
the
tribe
but
unenrolled
members
of
the
tribe,
then
there's
going
to
be
at
least
that
gap,
isn't
there?
justice
scalia
enrolled
members.
justice
scalia
yes,
but
at
the
time
of
1152,
if
you
assert
that
indian
there
just
means
an
indian
of
that
tribe,
it
surely,
as
you
just
say,
doesn't
mean
an
enrolled
member
of
that
tribe
since
there
was
no
enrollment.
justice
scalia
it
must
mean
an
indian
who
by
blood
belonged
to
that
tribe.
justice
scalia
all
right.
justice
scalia
equivalent
to
the
definition
of
enrollment?
justice
scalia
well,
if
it
isn't
exactly
equivalent,
then
you're
going
to
have
the
void
of
jurisdiction.
justice
scalia
would
you
consider
that
a
treaty
obligation
or
a
treaty
right?
justice
scalia
well,
why?
justice
scalia
well,
you...
in
these
treaties,
the
united
states
was
given
by...
by
the
tribe
the
right
to
take
care
of
trials
of
non-members
of
the
tribe.
i
would
think
that
i
would
regard
that
as
a
benefit
that
the
united
states
had
under
those
treaties,
not
as
an
obligation
that
it
assumed.
justice
scalia
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying,
but
i...
but
it
seems
to
me
that
that
power
on
the
part
of
the
united
states,
i...
i
would
not
regard
that
as
an
obligation
of
the
united
states
which...
which
it
is
repudiating
in
the
statute
but,
rather,
as
a
right
of
the
united
states
which
it
is
permitted
to
give
up
by
the
statute
if
it
wants
to.
i
mean,
you...
you
look
upon
it
as
an
obligation.
i'm
not
sure
it
should
be
regarded
as
an
obligation
as
much
as
a
duty.
justice
scalia
as
a
right.
justice
scalia
they
told
the
tribes,
though,
you
can't...
you
cannot
try
members
of
other
tribes.
we'll
try
them.
justice
scalia
do
you
think
the
tribes
thought
that
the
u.s.
was
doing
them
a
favor
when
they
said
you
can't
try
members
of
other
tribes?
you
thought
that
that's
how
they
regarded
that,
as
an
obligation
of
the
united
states?
justice
scalia
mr.
wilks,
why
just--
justice
scalia
--mr.
wilks,
why
just
enrolled
indians?
why
do
you
just
limit
these
rights
that
you're
talking
about?
if
you're
appealing
to
the
rights
that
the
tribes
had
way
back
in
history,
how
can
you
limit
that
principle
to
just
enrolled
indians
from
other
tribes?
justice
scalia
are
there
laws,
mr.
wallace,
under
which
we
treat
unenrolled
indians
who
are
eligible
for
enrollment
but
have
chosen
not
to
enroll
the
same
as
enrolled
indians?
justice
scalia
--why
is
that
so?
i
mean,
there...
there...
there
are
more
white...
there
are
more
white
residents
on
the
reservation
who
are
not
subject
to
the
tribe
than
there
are
residents
of
other
kind
by
a...
by
a
good
deal.
