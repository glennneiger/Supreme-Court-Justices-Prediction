then
there
would
be
a
void.
justice
white
there
would
be,
wouldn't
there?
justice
white
why?
justice
white
exactly.
1152
and
1153
just
speak
of
indians.
justice
white
i
know,
but
it
certainly
isn't
defined
as
an
enrolled
indian.
justice
white
that's
really
allows
a
construction
of
the
federal
statute.
justice
white
and
if
you
can
construe
it
that
way,
you
might
be
able
to
construe
it
some
other
way.
justice
white
well,
then
he
would...
he
would
not
be
an
indian
with
respect...
in
the...
the--
justice
white
--he
would
not
be
considered
an
indian
even
though
he
was
just
because
he
wasn't
enrolled
and
that
he
had
opted
out.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
then...
then
he
be
subject
to
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
white
how
would
you
like
us
to
read
1152?
justice
white
but
what
about
an
enrolled
indian
who
says
i
want
out
and
i
opt
out
and
he's
no
longer
an
enrolled
member
and
doesn't
want
to
be?
what
about
1153?
he
would
still
be
an
indian,
wouldn't
he?
justice
white
could
your
client
be
charged
and
tried
and
tried
by
his
own
tribe
for
this
offense?
justice
white
so
if
you
win,
there
isn't
any
gap
at
all?
