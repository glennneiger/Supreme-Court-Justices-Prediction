mr.
richard
b.
wilks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
albert
duro
came
onto
the
salt
river
pima-maricopa
indian
community
reservation
with
his
girlfriend,
lived
with
her,
lived
with
her
there
for
three
and
a
half
months,
worked
for
the
picopa
construction
company,
a
wholly-owned
company
by
the
salt
river
pima-maricopa
indian
community,
subjected
himself
to
the
laws
of
the
community
by
committing
an
offense
under
the
laws
of
the
community
and
the
possession
of
alcohol
and
marijuana,
pled
guilty
to
the
charge
brought
by
the
community,
was
found
guilty
and
was
fined.
thereafter,
the
incident
of
the
firing
of
the
gun
took
place.
he
was
indicated
by
the
federal
grand
jury.
that
indictment
was
later
dismissed
with
prejudice,
and
he
was
charged
by
the
salt
river
community
in
that
offense
which
resulted
in
the
death
of
a
14-year-old
boy
who
was
a
member
of
the
gila
river
indian
community,
which
interestingly
enough,
is
also
a
community
made
up
of
pima
and
maricopa
indians.
the
young
boy
was
a
resident
of
the
maricopa...
of
the...
of
the
salt
river
pima-maricopa
indian
community.
the
issue
here,
i
think,
is
whether
the
jurisdiction
and
powers
of
the
salt
river
pima-maricopa
indian
community,
which
it
clearly
and
without
a
doubt
had
at
the
time
of
american
sovereignty,
that
is
to
try
and,
if
guilty...
found
guilty,
to
punish
offenders
against
its
law,
have
been
diminished
since
american
sovereignty,
either
by
incompatibility
with
the
nature
of
the
dependent
status
of
the
salt
river
indian
community,
or
by
explicit
federal
enactments.
there
have
been
no
explicit
federal
enactments
which,
i
would
submit,
limit
the
jurisdiction
of
the
community
in
regard
to
albert
duro
or
to
such
an
offender.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
i
don't
think
it
requires
an
equal
protection
analysis
in
this
case,
justice
o'connor.
the
civil
rights
equal
protection
provision
says
that
they
will
not
deny
equal
protection
to
anyone
within
its
jurisdiction.
non-indians
are
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
salt
river
community
court
since
oliphant
and,
assumably,
before
that.
so
there
is
not
a...
that
kind
of
invidious
distinction
can't
be
made.
the...
the
people
who
are
before
are
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
salt
river
court
are
all
indian
people,
and
by
that
it
must
be
clear
that
that
means
enrolled
members
of
federally
recognized
indian
tribes.
as
we
have
attempted
in
our
brief
to
point
out,
when
we
talk
about
enrolled
indians,
we're
talking
about
a
status
as
this
court
has
in
fisher
and
mancari
and
antelope.
we're
not
talking
about
an
ethnic
group;
indian
people
who
are
enrolled
members
of
tribes
can
indeed
opt
out
of
that
status
and
can
indeed--
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
--give
up
the
benefits
that
accrue
to
indian
people
under
federal
law
and
perhaps
gain
other
benefits,
as
mr.
duro
might
have,
had
he
not
been
a
member
of
a
federally
recognized
tribe.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
what
i
did
not
say,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
rights
that
the
tribes
had
before
american
sovereignty
have
as
to
criminal
jurisdiction
over
indians
has
remained
unchanged
through
history.
it
has
obviously
been
changed.
the...
that
whole
unit
of...
of...
of
jurisdical
powers
has
been
changed
by
federal
legislation
so
that,
under
the
major
crimes
act,
federal
jurisdiction
is
had
over
certain
kinds
of
enumerated
crimes.
under
the
indian
country
crimes
act
and
assimilated
crimes
act,
certain
acts
committed
by
indians
against
non-indians
are
in
federal
court
jurisdiction
to
the
exclusion
of
tribal
court
jurisdiction.
the...
the...
but...
but...
the
court
has
or
the
congress
has
defined
indians.
they've
defined
indians
in
the
indian
reorganization
act,
and
they've
defined
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our...
in
the
exhibits
in
our
brief,
they
defined
with
care
what
an
indian
is,
and
they've
defined
it
by
explaining
so
that
an
enrolled
indian
under
the
indian
reorganization
act
is
defined,
and
that's
the
limitation
of
it.
now
the
indian
reorganization
act
as
well
speaks
of
indian
by
blood
quantum.
i
think
that
is
not
a...
in
practice
something
which
still
exists
as
an
enrollment
characteristic
in
tribal
constitutions.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
i
don't
know
if
i'd
use
that
word,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
think
that
the
answer
is
yes,
and
i
think
that,
for
instance,
this
court,
in
morton
v.
mancari,
did
the
same
thing
or
recognized
that
principle
when
it
upheld
the
indian
preference
law
on
the
grounds
that
indian
employees
of
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
even
though
they
are
not
members
of
the
tribes
to
which
they
are
assigned,
would
benefit
those
tribes
in
their...
in
their
ability
to
govern
themselves.
so
that
fungibility,
if
the
word
is
fungibility,
i
think
is
there.
so
what
we
have
is
a
pattern
beginning
from
before
american
sovereignty,
a
pattern
where
there
have
been
changes,
there
have
been
restrictions
on
indian
jurisdiction,
tribal
court
jurisdiction.
and
this
court
and
the
executive
have
noted
from
time
to
time
what
those
restrictions
are
not,
because
if
you
have
a
whole
and
you've
taken
pieces
out
of
it
and
you've
said
this
is
in
federal
court,
you
leave
something.
and
what
has
been
left,
as
the
court
on
a
couple
of
occasions
has
said,
is
for
the...
for
the
indian
tribes
to
deal
with
these
questions.
so
that
in
rogers,
this
tribe
or
some
other
would
have
criminal
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
that's
correct;
and
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
wheeler
in
an...
in
the
unresolved
question
as
to
whether
if...
if
the
sovereignty,
if
the
jurisdiction
had
been
accorded
by
congress
to
the
tribes,
would
there
then
be
the
dual
jurisdictions.
yes,
if...
if
there
would
be
a
void
if...
if
the
petitioner
were
to
prevail
and
that
void
could
be
cured,
if
it
would
be
cured,
and
if
time
in
passing
killed
the
cure,
if
it
ever
occurred,
did
not
result
in
great
harm.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
it
could
not
be
totally
cured.
you're
right,
justice
kennedy.
it
could
not
be
cured,
so
that
the
cure
would
allow
this
court
to
rule
as
it
did
in
wheeler.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
i
think
there
would
not
be
a
void
if--
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
--i
think
there
would
not
be
a
void.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
because
the
individual
as
defined
was
not
an
enrolled
member
of
any
tribe,
of
any
indian
tribe,
and
there...
of
any
federally
recognized
indian
tribe,
and,
therefore,
could
be
dealt
with
either
in
federal
or
state
court,
depending
on
what
the
circumstances
are.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
i
have
some
difficulty
in
answering
that
definitively
because
of
the
50
percent
blood
quantum
in
the--
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
--yes,
and
i
think,
as
it
was
earlier
pointed
out,
indian
is
now
defined.
it
may
not
have
been
defined
at
the
time
of
the
first
passage
of--
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
--yes.
the
indian
is
a...
an
enrolled
member
of
a
federally
recognized
indian
tribe,
i
believe
is
the
definition,
the
one...
the
first
definition.
the
second
i
believe
is
a
person
who
may
be
enrolled,
a
child
perhaps
who
has
not
yet
been
enrolled;
and
the
third
is
the
blood...
more
than
50
percent
blood
quantum
definition.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
i...
i
think
that
they
probably
would
be,
but
i...
that
again...
again
is
not
something
that
has
been
determined.
it
seems
to
me
the
question
here
of
whether
there
has
been
a
loss
of
jurisdiction
since
american
sovereignty
over...
over
member
indians,
members
of
other
tribes,
has
to
in
the
end
deal
with
the
question
of
what
the
effect
of
not
having
jurisdiction
would
be,
what
the
effect
of
such
a
determination
would
be.
and
this
court
has
spoken
in...
in
brendale
and
has
spoken
in
wheeler
in
regards
to
what
i
would
view
as
a...
as
a
bottom
line
kind
of
test.
does
the
removal
of
jurisdiction
or
the
nonrecognition
of
tribal
jurisdiction
impact
to
the
significant
disadvantage
of
indian
tribes
so
that
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
carry
on
or
not
successfully
carry
on
as...
as
polities,
as
governmental
units.
and
i
think
the
answer
is,
as
you've
seen
from
the
brief
filed
by
the
native
american
rights
fund,
the
amicus
brief,
with
its
detail
of
what's
happening
now
in
indian
country,
that
the
large
numbers
of
indian
people
of
different
tribes
living
on
reservations
would
make
the
control
of...
of
criminal
activity
almost
impossible.
a
government,
an
indian
tribe
can't
exist
in
that
way,
and
i
think
the
brendale
test,
the
test
in
wheeler
and
antelope
covered
that.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
would
not
be...
we're
dealing
only
with
misdemeanors.
we
essentially
have
a
tautological
question.
you
don't
lose...
indian
tribes
don't
lose
their
initial
sovereignty,
initial
jurisdiction,
simply
because
it
disappears.
they
lose
it
because
it's
incompatible
with
the
dominant
sovereign,
and
they
lose
it
only
if
it
does
not
have
such
an
effect
upon
their
existence
as
will
tend
to...
to...
to
destroy
them,
terminate
indian
tribes.
and
i
would
suggest
in
this
situation
with
the
facts
that
we
all
know
exist
in
indian
country,
with
the
mobility
of
indian
people
and
the
many
indian
people
of
different
tribes
living
on
reservations
not
their
own,
that
the
effect
would
be
disastrous.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
that's
a
very
large
leap
of
faith.
i
would
not...
i
would
not
make
that
assumption.
mcbratney
has
just
been
manhandled
earlier
here.
mcbratney--
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
--to
some
extent.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
but
at
least
the
rationality
of
mcbratney
and
its
prodigy
dealt
with...
with
equal
footing,
with
questions
of
whether
there
was--
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
--implicit
amendment.
we
don't
have
any
of
that
here.
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
and
if
that
is
correct,
and
i...
i--
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
--it
was
not
valid,
i
think,
because
the
state
had
jurisdiction
at
the
time
of
oliphant,
and
the
state
does
not
now
have
jurisdiction.
the
state
of
arizona
has
never
adopted--
mr.
richard
b.
wilks
--mcbratney
line
of
reasoning
does
not
apply,
i
think.
