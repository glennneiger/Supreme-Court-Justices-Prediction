mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
submission
here
is
based
on
this
court's
analysis
in
the
oliphant
case.
here,
as
there,
there
has
been
no
express
divestiture
of
jurisdiction
in
the
tribe
by
either
treaty
or
statute.
some
reference
has
been
made
to
early
treaty
provisions
which
had
so-called
depredation
provisions.
those
provided
that,
rather
than
engage
in
warfare
with
other
tribes,
compensation
would
be
available
for
depredations
committed
by
members
of
other
tribes.
they
were
not
treaty
provisions
written
in
terms
of
conferring
criminal
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
government
to
prosecute
those
persons.
they
provided
either
for
an
arbitration
process
under
the
auspices
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
provide
compensation
for
such
depredations
or,
in
some
instances,
for
compensation
from
the
federal
treasury
in
return
for
the
indians'
agreement
not
to
engage
in
warfare
with
other
tribes
as
a
result
of
such
so-called
depredations.
so
there
has
been
no
express
divestiture
of
the
jurisdiction
here,
and
the
question
is
whether
its
retention
is
subject
to
an
implied
divestiture
because
it
would
be
incompatible
with
the
status
of
the
tribes
as
dependent
limited
sovereigns.
the
court
concluded
in
oliphant
that
there
was
such
an
implied
divestiture
because
of
the
long
historical
understanding
that
the
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
did
not
exist
and
because
the
federal
government
by
statute
had
assumed
jurisdiction
to
prosecute
those
offenses.
the
same
considerations
quite
clearly,
it
seems
to
us,
lead
to
the
opposite
conclusion
here.
from
1817
to
the
present,
the
federal
criminal
statutes
applicable
to
crimes
in
indian
country
have
contained
an
exception
for
crimes
by
indians
against
the
person
or
property
of
other
indians.
that
exception
was
authoritatively
interpreted
by
this
court
in
the
united
states
v.
rogers
back
in
1846.
it
was
the
version
that
has
been
carried
forward
ever
since,
and
we
have
quoted
the
applicable
language
on
page
12
of
our
brief,
and
the
exception
does
not
speak
of
members
of
a
tribe,
it
says,
but
of
the
race
generally
of
the
family
of
indians,
and
it
intended
to
leave
them
as
both
regarded
their
own
tribe
and
other
tribes
also
to
be
governed
by
indian
usages
and
customs.
that
was
not
an
obscure
opinion.
it
was
an
opinion
by
chief
justice
taney
for
a
unanimous
court.
it
is
not
a
lengthy
opinion
in
which
this
interpretation
might
be
overlooked.
the
opinion
is...
the
opinion
portion
of
the
opinion
is
only
four
printed
pages
in
the
united
states
reports,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
the
provision
has
been
reenacted
repeatedly,
interpreted
in
an
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
that
we
cite,
and
there
has
never
been
any
repudiation
of
that
interpretation
by
congress
as
it
has
carried
that
provision
forward.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
we
think
it
is
not
entirely
race
based
even
though
as
we
say
there
is
an
ancestral
element
included
in
it.
much
of
the
reason
that
there
is
commingling
of
members
of
various
tribes
on
the
reservations
today
is
because
benefits
are
made
available
by
the
federal
government
under
the
authority
of
morton
v.
mancari
and
other
decisions
of
this
court
to
members
of
tribes
regardless
of
whether
they're
members
of
the
home
tribe.
indian
health
services
are
available;
employment
preferences
are
available
both
in
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
and
in
tribal
enterprises.
this
has
encouraged
the
living
together
of
indians
and
the
identification
of
indians
as
tribal
persons
subject
to
some
unique
legal
relationships
based
on
their
history
and
on
the
constitution's
provision
in
article
1
that
congress
can
regulate
commerce
with
the
indian
tribes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
and
we
don't
think
that
does
make
a
difference.
there--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
was
the
question
before
this
court
in
united
states
v.
antelope,
and
the
court
unanimously
held
that
congress
justifiably
could
treat
members
of
indian
tribes
who
are
citizens
of
the
united
states
differently
from
other
citizens
with
respect
to
which
court
has
criminal
jurisdiction
over
them
and
the
punishment
to
which
they
are
subjected.
i
think
that
is
precisely
what
was
at
issue
in
the
antelope
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
it
is
true
here.
these
are
members
of
tribes.
these
are
enrolled
members
of
tribes
who
are
in
a
unique
relationship
with
the
federal
government
and
enjoy
certain
benefits
and
obligations
as
a
result
of
that,
and
it
changes
the
tribunals
that
have
jurisdiction
over
certain
offenses
that
they
may
commit.
it
is
very
similar
to
the
antelope
case
in
that
respect.
these
are
authorized
tribunals,
the
tribal
courts,
and
they
are
trying
citizens
of
the
united
states.
members
of
their
own
tribe
are
citizens
of
the
united
states.
and
we
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
jurisdictional
gap
of
any
kind.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
while
that
question
need
not
be
faced
in
this
case
because
we're
dealing
with
an
enrolled
member,
we
think
that
if...
if
a
person
is
eligible
for
enrollment
as
a
member
and
has
not
repudiated
membership
in
the
tribe,
that
that
person
should
be
treated
the
same
as
an
enrolled
member
for
these
purposes
just
as
someone
who
hasn't
registered
to
vote.
if
it's
just
a
formality
that
has
kept
someone
off
the
rolls,
that
would
not
be
a
repudiation
of
tribal
identification.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
does,
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
is
correct,
but
otherwise
you
would
get
into
a
peculiar
anomaly
with
respect
to
the
members
of
the
tribe
itself
who
are
resident
on
the
reservation,
some
of
whom
may
not
have
bothered
to
get
their
names
onto
the
tribal
rolls;
and
why
they
should
be
treated
differently
with
respect
to
the
tribal
court's
jurisdiction
is
not
apparent.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
duro
can
opt
out.
any
person
can
resign
his
membership
but
not
retroactive.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
and
i...
but
i...
i
added
and
he
has
not
repudiated
his
membership
in
the
tribe.
if
a
person
does
not
want
to
be
treated
as
a
tribal
member
but
wants
to
be
treated
as
any
other
citizen,
that
is
his
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
any
of
the
jurisdictional
statutes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
correct,
but
not
retroactively.
at
the
time
of
the
offense--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--or
even
or
to
state
jurisdiction
if
there
was
no
indian
involved
in
the
crime.
he
would
not--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there's
no
decision
of
this
court
on
the
subject,
but
i
think
the
logic
of
the
court's
decisions
are
assumed
in
the
19th
century
that
indians
are
all
members
of
tribes.
enrollment
is
something
that
came
much
later.
and
as
i
say,
in
this
case
enrollment
is
satisfied,
and
we
don't
have
to
face
up
to
that
problem.
either
way,
we
think
there
would
not
be
a
jurisdictional
gap,
but
we
think
that
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
court
would
extend
beyond
enrollment.
the
other
case--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
there
would
still
be
a
considerable
problem
when
the...
when
an
indian
was
involved
in
the
crime.
i
don't
see
how
the
state
would
have
jurisdiction
when
it
has
not--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--through
public
law
280,
and
that
would
require
a
reinterpretation
of
that
exception.
it
would
really
mean
that
the
rogers
interpretation
is
being
changed
by
the
court
even
though
congress
has
seen
fit
to
carry
forward
this
provision
and
has
never
questioned
that
interpretation.
the...
the
other
case
that
i
want
to
call
to
the
court's
attention
that
i
think
sheds
considerable
historical
light
on
this
was
the
interpretation
initially
of
the
major
crimes
act
provision
in
united
states
v.
kagama,
this
court's
1886
decision.
at
page
383
of
volume
118,
the
court
made
very
clear
that
it
was
reading
the
major
crimes
act
which
was
enacted
because
state
courts
did
not
have
jurisdiction
and
these
major
crimes
would
only
be
subject
to
tribal
courts,
and
they
were
worried
that
the
tribal
courts
would
not
deal
adequately
with
these
major
crimes.
and
the
court
ruled,
again
unanimously,
in
a
reasonably
concise
opinion,
that
the
fair
inference
is
that
the
offending
indian
shall
belong
to
that
or
some
other
tribe.
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
process
of
state
courts
within
the
reservation,
or
nor
would
the
operation
of
state
laws
upon
white
people
found
there.
it
was
quite
clear
that
the
state
courts
were
thought
not
to
have
jurisdiction
over
members
of
other
tribes.
its
effect
is
confined
to
the
acts
of
an
indian
of
some
tribe
of
a
criminal
character
committed
within
the
limits
of
the
reservation.
that
was
the
category
of
offenses
that
correspondingly
were
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
courts
and
where
congress
felt
that
for
major
crimes
the
tribal
court
should
not
be
relied
upon
but
they
still
were
being
relied
upon
for
the
minor
offenses,
the
minor
assaults,
domestic
violence,
disorderly
conduct,
the
same
offenses
on
which
we
continue
to
rely
upon
the
tribal
courts
to
keep
law
and
order
on
the
reservations.
and
this
case
is
of
great
practical
importance
to
the
ability
to
maintain
law
and
order
on
the
reservations.
we
have
been
striving--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--on
many
reservations
that
is
true,
and
those
are
the
reservations
where
other
enforcement
authorities
tend
to
be
more
available.
but
on
the
ones
where
it's
mostly
other
indians
who
are
residents,
there
isn't
much
else
to
rely
on.
