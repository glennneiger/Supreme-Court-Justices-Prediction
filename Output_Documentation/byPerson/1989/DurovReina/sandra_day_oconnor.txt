justice
o'connor
it
resulted
in
a
death?
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
if
you
were
to
prevail
here,
i
take
it
no
prosecution
for
the
discharge
of
the
firearm
would
be
possible
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
why
not?
justice
o'connor
well,
in
arizona
it
has
not,
of
course,
come
within
the
purview
of
public
law
280.
it
does
not
have
criminal
jurisdiction
for
offenses--
justice
o'connor
--so
that's
out.
justice
o'connor
all
right.
justice
o'connor
is
there
any
case
from
this
court
that
you
would
point
to
to
indicate
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
criminal
jurisdiction
here?
i
thought
we
took
it
as
a
given
that
the
state
did
not.
justice
o'connor
so
your
response
to
me
was
wrong.
you
do
not
assert
the
state
of
arizona
could
assert
jurisdiction
here?
justice
o'connor
no,
we're
talking
about
this
offense.
i...
i
thought
it
was
an...
a...
a
member
of
the
tribe
who
was
killed.
justice
o'connor
it's
a
non-indian
who
was
killed?
justice
o'connor
all
right.
now,
would
you
tell
me
so
that
i
understand
it,
please,
whether
you
assert
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
criminal
jurisdiction
over
the
offense,
if
any?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
federal
government
had
dismissed
the
suit,
and
the
solicitor
general
representing
the
federal
government
says
it
has
no
jurisdiction
over
this
offense.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
don't
know
about
liking
to.
the
concern
is
there
may
in
fact
be
a
void.
justice
o'connor
well,
the...
the
indian
civil
rights
act
gives
one
pause
when
if
that
requires
us
to
make
an
equal
protection
sort
of
analysis.
justice
o'connor
well,
now,
under
your
view,
mr.
wilks,
the
tribe
has
jurisdiction
over
any
enrolled
member
of
any
indian
tribe
if
the
offense
is
committed
by
that
member
on
the
reservation?
justice
o'connor
but
if
the
person
were
not
an
enrolled
member
and
yet
were
an
indian
living
on
the
reservation
but
not
of
that
tribe,
then
the
tribe
could
not
exercise?
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
under
federal
law
that
they
might
look
to
see
if
the
person
was
in
fact
of
indian
blood?
justice
o'connor
and
those
latter
two
people
wouldn't
be
covered
for
purposes
of
tribal
jurisdiction,
i
take
it?
justice
o'connor
the
problem...
go
ahead.
but
any
void
that
might
exist
wouldn't
be
a
void
with
respect
to
serious
crimes,
would
it?
justice
o'connor
but
mr.
wallace,
does
it
raise
equal
protection
concerns,
do
you
think,
that
kind
of
race-based
division?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
about
non-enrolled?
