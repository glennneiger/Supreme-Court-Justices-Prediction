justice
kennedy
did
the
ninth
circuit
adopt
the
context
rule
as
part
of
a
statutory
analysis?
how
did
it
purport
to
justify
the
context
rule?
justice
kennedy
did...
did...
did
it
purport
to
be
some
sort
of
a
constitutional
analysis?
justice
kennedy
and
how
was
that?
justice
kennedy
is
it
also
a
possibility
that
no
void
exists
because
we
interpret
the
exception
clause
of
1152
to
apply
to
tribal
members?
justice
kennedy
is
there...
is
there
any
precedent
that
would
allow
us...
would
we
have
to
go
contrary
to
our
precedence
to
do
that?
justice
kennedy
so
that
response
to
justice
scalia
indicates
that
it
would
be
difficult,
it
seems
to
me,
to
interpret
1152
to
avoid...
to
prevent
the
void?
justice
kennedy
well,
but...
but
how
can
you
do
that
consistently
with
what
you
just
told
justice
scalia?
justice
kennedy
because
we're
talking
about
the
word
"indian".
justice
kennedy
is
it
the
position
of
the...
of
your
opponents
that
duro
could
not
have
resigned
his
membership
in
his
tribe
and
thereby
avoided
jurisdiction?
justice
kennedy
and
that
would
make
him
a
non-indian?
justice
kennedy
aside
from
the
equal
protection
point,
do
you
argue
that
there
is
any
constitutional
problem
with
the
united
states
consenting
to
the
tribes
asserting
jurisdiction
over
duro?
justice
kennedy
what...
what
is
that
constitutional
argument?
justice
kennedy
but
what
is
the
constitutional
principle
that
would
be
violated
if
the
united
states
were
to
say
that
duro
could
be
tried
by
this
tribe?
justice
kennedy
do
you
have
any...
do
you
have
any
cases
on...
on
that...
for
that
proposition?
justice
kennedy
based
on...
based
on
that
analysis,
if...
if
we
were
to
find
that
there
was
a
void
here,
i
take
it
congress
couldn't
cure
it
by
giving
the
indian
tribes
additional
jurisdiction
without
then
laying
itself
open
to
the
charge
that
they're
surrendering
the
rights
of
citizens?
i
mean,
i
take
it
there's
a
difference
between
sovereignty
that
exists
in
the
indian
tribes
and
is
taken
on
the
one
hand
and
sovereignty
that
is
reconferred
or
regranted
by
the
united
states?
justice
kennedy
my...
my
suggestion
is
that
perhaps
it
could
not
be
cured.
justice
kennedy
under
that
line
of
reasoning,
i
take
it
that
duro
could
not
opt
out
his
indian
status?
justice
kennedy
well,
why,
if
you
say
he's
entitled,
if...
if
the
test
is
he's
entitled
to
enrollment?
justice
kennedy
mr.
wallace,
if...
if...
if
we
were
to
read
1153
to
mean
tribal
member
as
the
petitioners
here
wish
us
to,
should
we
read
the
exception
clause
in
1152
the
same
way
to
prevent
the
void
from
arising?
justice
kennedy
well,
the
federal
government...
the
federal
government--
