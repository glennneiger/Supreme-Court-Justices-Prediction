mr.
john
trebon
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
an
american
citizen
can
be
submitted
to
the
criminal
jurisdiction
of
an
indian
tribe
even
though
he
is
not
a
member
of
the
tribe
simply
because
he
or
she
is
an
indian;
or,
should
they
be
treated
like
mr.
oliphant
and
other
non-members
with
whom
they
are
similarly
situated.
albert
duro,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
is
a
california
indian.
he
is
a
member
of
the
torez-martinez
band
of
mission
indians.
he
was
raised
in
california
on
private
land
and
is
a
permanent
resident
of
the
state
of
california.
he
is
not
a
member
of,
nor
is
he
eligible
for
membership
in
the
salt
river
tribe,
who
is
the
respondent
in
this
case.
for
approximately
three
months
in
1984,
albert
duro
stayed
on
the
salt
river
reservation
with
his
girlfriend,
who
is
also
from
california.
during
june
of
1984,
a
firearm
discharged
and
accidentally
shot
a
14-year-old
boy
that
was
riding
a
bicycle
approximately
two
blocks
away,
undoubtedly
an
unfortunate
incident.
mr.
duro,
along
with
sean
lackey,
was
indicated
in
federal
court
for
first
degree
murder
relating
to
that
charge.
mr.
john
trebon
it
did
result
in
death,
justice
o'connor,
yes.
he
was
indicted
for
first
degree
murder,
and
after
the
case
was
in
federal
court
for
several
months,
it
was
dismissed
on
motion
of
the
government
and
dismissed
without
prejudice.
the
government
has
never
refiled
that
charge
against
mr.
duro.
two
days
after
the
case
was
dismissed
in
federal
court,
the
federal
marshals
turned
mr.
duro
over
to
the
salt
river
tribe.
he
was
charged
in
the
salt
river
tribe
with
discharge
of
firearms,
which
is
a
misdemeanor.
a
motion
to
dismiss
was
filed
by
mr.
duro
in
the
salt
river
tribe.
that
motion
was
denied
by
judge
manuel.
we
then
filed
a
habeas
corpus
petition
before
the
federal
district
court.
judge
copple,
who
the
court
may
remember
was
the
district
court
judge
involved
in
the
wheeler
decision
and
upheld
by
this
court,
issued
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
in
favor
of
mr.
duro.
that
was
appealed
by
the
respondent
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
ninth
circuit,
in
a
2-1
decision
with
judge
sneed
dissenting,
held
that
non-member
indians,
unlike
non-indians,
are
subject
to
the
criminal
jurisdiction
of
an
indian
tribe
if
they
have
significant
contacts
with
the
reservation;
not
if
the
crime
involves
significant
contacts
with
the
reservation
but
merely
whether
or
not
the
person
involved
has
significant
contacts
with
the
reservation.
mr.
john
trebon
it...
it
purported
to
justify
it
on
the
basis
that
the
tribe
had
an
interest
in
someone
over
whom
they
had
a
significant
contact.
the
significant
context
test,
as
far
as
i
can
see,
has
no
direct
relation
to
any
statute.
mr.
john
trebon
no,
it
did
not.
i
think,
with
all
due
respect
to
the
ninth
circuit,
it
was
a
rule
that
they
modeled
in
order
to
fit
the
problem
that
they
determined
to
exist
on
the
reservation.
mr.
john
trebon
well,
justice
o'connor,
we
don't
necessarily
feel
that
that
is
true.
in
fact--
mr.
john
trebon
--well,
first
of
all,
we
think
that
two
separate
sovereigns
could
fill
the
supposed
void
that
the
respondents
argue
exist.
the
state
government
could--
mr.
john
trebon
--you're
correct,
justice
o'connor.
that's
true.
mr.
john
trebon
that's
true.
mr.
john
trebon
but
the
state
of
arizona
continues
to
exercise
criminal
jurisdiction
for
crimes
committed
on
the
reservation
between
two
non-indians,
and
that
jurisdiction
exists
regardless
of
whether
or
not
it's
a
280
state.
the
same
analysis
that
allows
them
under
mcbratney
and
that
line
of
cases
to
have
jurisdiction
over
non-indians
would
similarly
allow
them
to
have
jurisdiction
over
non-member
indians.
in
fact--
mr.
john
trebon
--this
court
has
not
directly
focused
upon
that
issue
as
of
yet.
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression.
the
cases
that
i
would
point
the
court
to
would
be
not
only
the
mcbratney
line
of
cases
but
the
cases
ever
since
fletcher
v.
peck
through
brendale
involving
oliphant
and
wheeler
and
the
cases
that
follow
that
define
tribal
sovereignty
with
respect
to
its
own
members
in
the
state
interest
on
the
reservation
to
all
non-members,
not
simply
non-indians.
so
if
you
follow
that
line
of
reasoning,
the
mcbratney
rationale
could
easily
be
extended
to
cover
non-member
indians
on
the
reservation.
mr.
john
trebon
no,
i
would
think...
well,
yes.
the
non-member
indian...
no,
that
would
be
federal
court.
i'm
sorry,
chief
justice.
that's
exactly
right.
that
would
continue
to
be
in
federal
court
under
1152.
mr.
john
trebon
i
think
the
state
of
arizona
could
assert
jurisdiction
involving
an
offense
on
the
reservation--
mr.
john
trebon
--it
was
not.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
trebon
it's
a
non-member.
it
is
a
member
of
an
adjoining
tribe,
an
adjoining
reservation.
neither
phillip
fernando
brown,
who
was
the
young
child
that
was
accidentally
shot
in
this
case,
nor
albert
duro,
is
a
member
of
the
host
tribe.
mr.
john
trebon
let
me
say,
justice
o'connor,
i
cannot
answer
that
question
in
the
definitive
manner
now,
but
it
is
very
likely
that
the
state
of
arizona
could
have
jurisdiction
under
the
rationale
of
mcbratney.
it
is
also
possible
that
the
federal
government
could
have
jurisdiction
as
well.
mr.
john
trebon
that's
true.
i
think
that
the
respondent
and
the
government
would
like
to
create
a
void
in
this
case,
but
one
doesn't
actually
exist--
mr.
john
trebon
--the
government
said
the
same
thing
to
this
court
in
oliphant.
they
said
there
could
be
a
hiatus
created
if
you
did
not
grant
tribal
court's
jurisdiction
over
non-indians.
the
same
type
of
void
arguably
exists
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
void
could
be
filled
in
the
same
manner
that
it
was
filled
after
oliphant.
mr.
john
trebon
state
courts
exercise
jurisdiction
after
oliphant.
mr.
john
trebon
precisely.
that
would
erase
the
void
completely.
the
other
thing
i
guess
i
should
point
out
is
that--
mr.
john
trebon
--the
only
case
that
the
court
would
have
to
go
contrary
to
arguably
would
be
the
dicta
in
united
states
v.
rogers.
rogers
is
a
case
involving
a
non-indian
crime
against
a
non-indian
crime.
the
non-indian
argued
before
the
court
that
he
was
an
indian
because
he
was
adopted
into
the
membership
of
the
tribe,
and
this
court
held
that
you
may
become
a
member
but
you
can't
become
an
indian
simply
because
you're
adopted
by
the
tribe
as
a
member.
besides
that,
however,
there
is
great
authority
for
doing
exactly
that,
justice
kennedy,
for
finding
that
the
indian
on
indian
exception
1152
really
means
member
on
member,
and
the
basis
for
that
is
when
that
was
first
included
in
the
first
permanent
trade
in
the
intercourse
act
in
1834,
it
was
introduced
with
three
other
bills,
one
of
them
being
the
western
territory
bill.
it
was
within
the
contemplation
of
congress
at
that
time
that
the
western
territory
would
be
created.
that
bill
provided
that
there
would
be
a
confederacy
of
the
indian
tribes
that
would
handle
jurisdiction
involving
intra-tribal
offenses,
when
there
are
offenses
committed
by
one
member
against
the...
against
a
member
of
another
tribe.
so
that
was
the
understanding
in
the
indian
trade
in
the
intercourse
acts.
and
also,
treaties
generally
provided...
at
the
time
that
the
trade
intercourse
acts
were
passed,
treaties
generally
provided
that
the
government
would
assert
inter-tribal
jurisdiction.
the
united
states
agreed
to
keep
peace
among
the
various
tribes
and,
therefore,
exercised
inter-tribal
jurisdiction.
in
fact,
all
the
commentors,
prucha
and
clinton
and
erhart
and
the
commentors
in
our
brief
all
agree
that
the
indian...
the
indian
exception
1152
indeed
means
tribal
members.
it
does
not
mean
to
vest
the
tribes
with
crimes
involving
one
member
against
another
member
of
a
different
tribe.
the
other
thing
about
the
void...
i
think
the
void
is
an
interesting
aspect
of
this
case...
is
that
even
if
the
respondents
win,
there
will
still
be
a
void.
in
order
to
get
away
from
equal
protection
and
other
problems
in
this
case,
they
suggested
to
this
court
that
it
should
find
that
a
tribe
has
jurisdiction
over
enrolled
indians
of
any
federally
recognized
tribe.
that
would
mean
who
would
have
jurisdiction
over
non-enrolled
indians?
the
indian
on
the
indian
exception
was
passed
by
congress
before
there
was
ever
such
a
thing
as
enrolled
indians.
it
was
passed
in
1834,
but
there
was
no
enrolled
indians
till
1934
when
the
indian
reorganization
act
was
passed.
so
that's
certainly
not
what
congress
meant.
so
the
tribe
now
gets
jurisdiction
only
over
enrolled
members.
non-enrolled
indians
living
on
the
reservation
will
be
subject
to
no
one's
jurisdiction
either
within
the
analysis
of
the
respondent
and
the
government.
and
in
fact,
the
population
statistics
for
this
particular
reservation
show
that
non-enrolled
indians
are
about
as
great
on
the
reservation
in
number
as
non-member
enrolled
indians,
so
the
void
will
be
equal.
so
that's
not
a
solution
to
the
void
problem.
in
fact,
it's
interesting
to
point
out
in
terms
of
a
void
if
this--
mr.
john
trebon
--it
would
if
the
court
was
willing
to
change
the
definition
of
indian
as
generally
applied
to
federal
jurisdiction
since
indian
law
began.
the
federal
government,
we
submit,
does
not
exercise
jurisdiction
simply
over
an
enrolled
indian.
there
has
always
been
a
definition
for
indian
in
federal
law
involving
not
only
whether
or
not
someone's
enrolled
but
also
whether
or
not
someone's
an
indian
by
race.
the
indian
reorganization
act
provides
that
if
someone's
more
than
50
percent
indian
by
race,
he's
an
indian
for
federal
purposes.
the
custom
and
habits
of
a
person
have
also
been
looked
at
by
this
court
to
determine
whether
or
not
someone
is
an
indian.
so
we--
mr.
john
trebon
--i
think
that's
true,
unless
the
court
does
as
you
suggested,
justice
kennedy,
define
that
it
means
tribal
members.
and
there's
a
great
deal
of
legislative
history--
mr.
john
trebon
--well,
i
think
the
way
you
do
it--
mr.
john
trebon
--the
way
you
do
it,
i
believe,
is
not
to
find
that
you
redefine
the
term
"indian",
but
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
to
see
what
congress
meant.
in
this
case
it
was
passed
in
conjunction
with
the
western
territory
bill
which
tends
to
define
the
meaning
applied
to
the
terms
by
congress.
moreover,
this
court
in
united
states
v.
wheeler
looked
at
all
these
statutes
in--
mr.
john
trebon
--not
necessarily.
mr.
john
trebon
no.
we
would
submit
that
if
the
tribe
exercised
jurisdiction
only
over
its
own
members--
mr.
john
trebon
--however
the
tribe
defines
its
own
membership.
different
tribes,
i
think,
have
different
definitions
for
that.
mr.
john
trebon
that's
correct.
mr.
john
trebon
and
the
indian
who's
considered
a
member
by
the
tribe
itself.
mr.
john
trebon
that,
we
submit,
would...
would
be
the
end
of
tribal
jurisdiction
and
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in
any
non-member,
someone
who
isn't
affiliated
by
the
tribe,
who
doesn't
have
the
privileges
of
membership
and
who's
not
considered
a
member
by
the
tribe.
mr.
john
trebon
i
don't
believe
it's
exactly
equivalent
to
the
definition--
mr.
john
trebon
--well,
the
void,
in
fact,
in
this
case,
if
you
decide
that
the
tribe
has
jurisdiction
over
enrolled
indians,
it's
interesting
to
know
that
14
percent
of
the
pimas
and
16
percent
of
the
maricopas
in
this
case
are
not
enrolled.
so
the
tribe
is
apparently
arguing
we
want
jurisdiction
only
over
enrolled
members.
we're
willing
to
give
up
14
percent
of
our
own
pimas
and
16
percent
of
our
own
maricopas.
so
there's
another
void
created.
pimas
and
maricopas
won't
even
be
covered
by
that
definition,
not
all
of
them,
and
that
represents
approximately
6
percent
of
the
total
population
of
the
reservation
as
well.
so
it's
kind
of
interesting
in
order
to
get
non-member
indians
who
are
not
affiliated
with
the
tribe
that
they're
willing
to
give
up
indians
who
are,
simply
because
they're
not
enrolled.
we
believe
that
this
court
essentially
grappled
with
these
issues
and
answered
them
not
only
in
oliphant
but
also
in
wheeler.
in
wheeler,
this
court
construed
the
same
statutes,
the
same
language,
and
explicitly
stated...
wheeler
was
argued
two
days
apart
from
oliphant
and
decided
16
days
later,
and
in
that
case
the
court
explicitly
stated
that
tribes
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
non-members.
and
the
reasoning
of
those
cases,
i
think,
is
particularly
applicable
here.
the
court
reasoned
that
the
tribes
have
the
right
of
self-government.
the
right
of
self-government
not
only
involves
the
same
federal
interest
in
law
and
order
but
also
involves
the
interest
in
preserving
orderly
relations
among
their
members
and
the
traditions
and
mores
of
a
society,
and
that
those
traditions
and
mores
should
be
preserved
through
tribal
government,
through
self-government.
that
necessarily
excludes
people
who
are
not
associated
with
the
tribe
as
members.
they
do
not
share
that
language.
they
do
not
share
in
those
customs
and
traditions.
they
share
no
more
in
those
customs
and
traditions
than
mr.
oliphant.
mr....
mr.
duro
and
mr.
oliphant
are
indistinguishable
before
this
court
in
terms
of
their
ties
with
the
community,
their
contacts
with
the
community;
then
mr.
duro
and
mr.
oliphant
are
similar.
mr.
john
trebon
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
mr.
john
trebon
it
has.
the
thing...
oliphant
is
not
only
consistent
with
history,
and
in
this
case
we
submit
as
well
the
history
shows
that
tribes
historically
did
not
exercise
jurisdiction
over
non-members.
the
government
did.
the
federal
government,
to
keep
peace
among
the
various
tribes,
took
upon
it
that
jurisdiction
through
treaties.
especially
from
1825
forward,
they
consistently
exercised
that
jurisdiction.
the
other
thing
that's
consistent
about
oliphant
and
other
cases
before
this
court
is
that
it
agrees
with
the
definition
of
tribal
self-government,
that
tribes
have
always
had
the
right
to
determine
the
relation
among
their
own
members
but
not
otherwise.
that's
true
in
the
tax
cases.
the
state's
interest
stops
with
members.
the
state
can
tax
non-members
on
the
indian
reservation
to
the
same
extent
that
they
can
tax
non-indians.
the
infringement
against
the
tribe
stops
with
membership
there
as
well.
the
williams
v.
lee
infringement
test
has
been
applied
by
this
court
to
stop
with
membership;
it
is
the
bright
line
that
this
court
has
continuously
used
throughout
to
define
the
integrity
of
self-government
versus
the
interest
of
some
other
government.
the
interest
in
this
case
could
be
the
state
or
the
federal
government.
the
argument
for
the
federal
government
is
that
they
have,
through
treaties,
had
an
obligation
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
intratribal
offenses.
so
if
1152
is
construed
to
mean
something
other
than
membership
in
a
tribe,
then
the
united
states
is
allowed
to
abrogate
in
a
sense
its
treaty
obligations
with
numerous
tribes.
we
don't
believe
that
the
court
should
do
that.
and
of
course,
there's
a
strong
equal
protection
argument
here.
why
would
the
court
want
to
treat--
mr.
john
trebon
--treaty
obligation.
mr.
john
trebon
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
and
a
right
on
the
part
of
the
tribe.
mr.
john
trebon
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
you're
mistaken.
i
don't
think
the
treaties
provided
that
tribes
could
exercise
jurisdiction
over
intertribal
offenses.
it
provided
jurisdiction
over
intratribal
offenses.
it
generally
provided
the
united
states
with
exercise
jurisdiction
over
intratribal--
mr.
john
trebon
--at
the
time--
mr.
john
trebon
--at
the
time
that
those
treaties
were
negotiated,
the
united
states
undertook
what
i
would
call
an
obligation
in
order
to
prevent
indian
wars.
at
that
time,
of
course,
the
united
states
government
considered
tribal
customs
and
traditions
to
be
that
of
the
blood
avenger
between
tribes.
mr.
john
trebon
correct.
mr.
john
trebon
i
would
characterize
it
not
merely
as
a
favor,
your
honor,
but
as
an
obligation
of
the
united
states.
but
within
the
scope
of
oliphant
and
its
review
of
history,
i
would
argue
that
it's...
it's
through
tradition.
it's
the
backdrop
of
history
that
this
court
must
look
at
to
decide
this
issue,
and
the
backdrop
of
history
in
this
case
shows
that
the
united
states
exercised
that
power
the
same
way
that
it
exercised
the
obligation
or
the
favor,
whatever
you
call
it,
in
oliphant
over
non-indians.
and
i
suppose
that's
essentially
the
point
here.
why
would
we
want
to
treat
mr.
duro
any
differently
than
we
treated
mr.
oliphant?
what's
the
difference
between
them?
there's
only
one.
the
only
difference
between
them
is
that
one
is
an
indian
and
one
is
not.
it
is
a
distinction
based
merely
upon
race.
there's
no
other
social
reasons.
there's
no
other
void
reasons.
there's
no
other
reason
besides
treating
them
differently
except
that
one's
an
indian
and
one
is
not.
after
years
of
assimilation,
after
mr.
duro
has
become
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
we
submit
that
he
should
be
treated
equally
with
non-indians.
mr.
john
trebon
they
say
that
he
could
give
up
his
membership.
mr.
john
trebon
it
would
make
him
a
non-enrolled
indian.
i...
i
find
that
to
be
particularly
offensive
that
mr.
duro
would
have
to
give
up
the
last
formal
vestige
of
relationship
to
his
tribe
in
order
to
enjoy
equal
rights
with
all
other
citizens
that
are
not
members
of
the
tribe
that
are
simply
non-indians.
why
should
he
have
to
give
that...
why
should
he
have
to
give
up
membership
in
a
tribe
500
miles
away
to
enjoy
equal
rights
with
other
citizens
on
the
salt
river
reservation?
mr.
john
trebon
i
would
have
made
the
same
argument
but
for
two
reasons.
let
first
say
that
there's
a
very
good
argument
that
mr.
duro's
ancestors
were
citizens
to
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
hidalgo
or
at
least
entitled
to
citizen...
citizenship
rights;
therefore,
he...
his
people
could
have
been
a
citizen
in
1848.
but
to
answer
the
question
directly,
i
think
things
have
changed
now.
if
mr.
duro
would
have
been
treated
differently
because
he
was
a
ward
rather
than
a
citizen,
then
the...
but
i
think
that
difference
relates
more
to
the
federal
government's
treatment
more
than
the
treatment
by
another
tribe.
in
fact,
the
treaties
during
that
time
would
have
generally
given
the
united
states
the
role,
if
not
the
obligation
or
the
favor,
the
role
of
exercising
jurisdiction
over
those
offenses.
mr.
john
trebon
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
mr.
john
trebon
well,
the
indian
civil
rights
act
was
passed
and
applied
some
of
the
constitutional
protections
of
the
bill
of
rights
to
the
exercise
of
criminal
jurisdiction
by
indian
tribes
but
not
all.
it's
important
to
point
out
that
it
was
a
compromise,
that
it
allowed
traditions
and
customs
of
the
tribe
which
is
unique
to
each
tribe
to
be
applied.
mr.
john
trebon
number
one,
no
right
to
counsel.
indigents
do
not
have
a
right
to
counsel
in
tribal
court.
the
penalty
that
can
now
be
imposed
in
tribal
court
for
each
count
is
one
year.
no
right
to
counsel.
secondly
and
most
fundamentally,
i
would
argue,
is
that
by
the
tribal
constitutional
law,
no
one
but
a
tribal
member
can
sit
in
a
jury
in
tribal
court;
therefore,
mr.
duro,
his
ethnological
group
and
any
other
group
of
non-members
cannot
sit
on
tribal
juries
in
tribal
court.
and,
of
course,
the
fifth
amendment
grand
jury
requirement
doesn't
apply
to
indian
tribes
either.
and,
of
course,
other
constitutional
rights
that
are
outside
of
the
bill
of
rights
that
apply
are
generally
you
don't
have
the
right
to
vote.
the
consent
of
the
governed
notion
of
this
country...
you
don't
have
the
right
to
vote,
you
don't
have
the
right--
mr.
john
trebon
--nevada
v.
hall,
i
believe,
is
a
case
on
point
for
consent
of
the
governed.
but
generally,
the
democratic
ideals
in
this
country
is
that
there's...
kagama
says
there's
two
sovereigns
in
this
nation.
indian
tribes
are
considered
to
be
domestic
dependent
sovereigns.
united
states
citizens
are
not
generally
submitted...
unless
the
court
does
it
in
this
case...
they
are
not
generally
submitted
to
courts
that
are
not
established
under
the
constitution
that
are
not
afforded
the
bill
of
rights,
that
are
tried
by
forums
in
this
country
without
constitutional
protection.
and
if
this
court
decides
that
in
this
case,
it
will
be
doing
it
for
mr.
duro
even
though
there's
no
difference
between
him
and
mr.
oliphant,
absolutely
none.
in
fact,
i
think
that
history
will
show
that
especially
now
in
washington
where
that
case
arose
from
that
non-indians
are
much
more
integrated
into
some
indian
tribes
than
non-member
indians.
they're
married
to
bia
employees.
they
live
on
the
reservation.
they
own
fee
land
within
the
confines
of
a
reservation.
they
have
just
as
many
connections
as
a
non-member
indian.
if...
if
you
don't
find
an
equal
protection
violation,
per
se,
then
at
least
you
should
be
guided
by
notions
of
fair
treatment.
if
i
can,
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
trebon
thank
you.
there's
no
compelling
reason
for
this
court
to
add
another
crazy
patch
to
the
quiltwork
of
indian
law.
the
bright
line
that's
been
established
by
this
court
in
not
going
back
to
rogers
but
in
united
states
v.
wheeler
should
be
applied
here.
rogers
doesn't
control
this
case.
oliphant
and
wheeler
do,
but
not
just
language
in
those
cases.
the
rationale
of
those
cases
apply
here.
let
me
clear
up
some
confusion
i
may
have
caused.
we
are
suggesting
one
solution
is
to
read
1152
to
mean
member
on
member.
we
still
believe
that
1153,
the
major
crimes
act,
would
apply
to
any
indian
on
the
reservation.
heretofore,
that
has
not
meant
enrolled
member.
that
is
not
a
definition
as
congress
used...
has
used,
and
we
don't
believe
that
that
has
been
applied
in
the
past.
you'd
have
to
rewrite
all
the
federal
statutes
in
order
to
gain
this
argument
for
the
respondents
so
that
you
can
shift
one
void
to
another.
it's
clear,
i
think
the
court
can
see,
from
the
questioning
thus
far
there's
not...
you're
not
going
to
avoid
a
void
by
deciding
this
case
in
a
certain
way.
mr.
john
trebon
i
believe
1152...
and
just
not
my
opinion
but
the
legislative
history,
we
believe,
supports
that
it
should
be
member
on
member.
the
tribal
court
would
have
jurisdiction
over
member
on
member.
if
it's
a
non-member
crime,
it
goes
into
federal
court
or
into
state
court
if
they
can...
if
they
can
argue,
in
a
subsequent
case,
that
the
state
interest
is
great
enough
to
extend
the
mcbratney
line
of
cases.
mr.
john
trebon
of
course.
he's
an
indian
by
federal
definition.
if
he's
over...
if
he's
over
25
percent
indian
blood
under
some
definitions
he
is.
under
the
indian
reorganization
act,
if
he's
over
50
percent
blood,
he
is.
and
this
court
i
hope
is
not
going
to
create
an
incentive
for
enrolled
indians
to
disenfranchise
themselves
with
their
own
tribes
in
order
to
gain
equal
rights
with
other
citizens.
i
mean,
hopefully
we
get
back
to
the
position
sometime
in
this
case
that
mr.
duro
and
mr.
oliphant
are
exactly
the
same
except
for
one
fact:
one's
an
indian
and
one
is
not.
why
should
we
treat
them
differently?
this
court
in
the
united
states...
in
antelope
didn't
say
that
you
could.
indians
are
tried
under
1153
in
federal
court,
and
so
are
non-indians.
they're
both
accorded
the
same
rights.
there
was
no
racial
classification
created
in
antelope.
federal
jurisdiction
was
exercised
over
both.
here,
tribal
jurisdiction
would
be
exercised
over
one
group
but
not
another,
even
though
they're
generally
within
the
class
of
non-members
simply
because
one
is
an
indian
and
one
is
not.
the
analysis
is
pretty
cohesive
if
you
apply
the
same
rationale
that
you
used
in
wheeler,
that
you
used
in
oliphant,
that
you've
used
in
rice
v.
rehner,
that
you
use
in
the
tax
cases,
that
you
use
when
you
applied
the
williams
v.
lee
infringement
test.
in
all
cases,
the
same
rationale
applies
here,
and
tribal
government
is
preserved,
in
fact
greater
so,
because
the
tribe
can
still
continue
to
exercise
not
only
jurisdiction
over
its
own
members
but
they
can
apply
the
customs
and
traditions
and
mores
that
they
have
always
applied
in
tribal
court.
they
don't
have
to
have
the
bill
of
rights
applying
to
them.
we
don't
have
to
destroy
tribal
sovereignty
in
order
to
gain
jurisdiction
over
this
void.
mr.
john
trebon
very
good
argument
that
he
could.
tribes
have
always
exercised
personal
sovereignty,
not
territorial
sovereignty.
in
this
court,
the
ninth
circuit
in
settler
v.
lameer
and
even
the
cfr
regulations
provide
that
they
have
jurisdiction
beyond
their
boundaries--
mr.
john
trebon
--that's
true.
