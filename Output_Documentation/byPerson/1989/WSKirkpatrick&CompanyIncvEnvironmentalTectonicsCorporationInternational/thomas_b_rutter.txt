mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
good
morning,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
there
is
one
thing
that
is
very
clear
as
we
come
to
the
podium
it
is
that
despite
any
broad
statements
we
might
find
in
the
oetjen
or
ricaud
case,
or
in
any
of
the
other
cases,
the
mere
fact
that
the
conduct
of
foreign
relations
is
committed
by
the
constitution
to
the
executive
branch
does
not
mean
that
every
case
or
controversy
which
touches
foreign
relations
lies
beyond
judicial
cognizance.
and
that's
an
exact
quotation,
if
the
court
please,
from
mr.
justice
harlan's
opinion
for
this
court
in
the
sabbatino
case.
what
needs
to
be
done
here,
i
suggest,
is
to
decide
which
of
the
several
bases
that
are
available
for
affirmance
of
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
be
adopted.
and
i
mean
by
that
this.
the
case
can
be
affirmed
on
a
very
narrow
basis.
that
is,
by
saying
this
court's
decisions
in
sisal
sales
and
continental
ore,
which
i
discuss
in
my
brief,
squarely
rule
the
outcome
of
this
case.
those
cases
say
very
simply
and
succinctly
that
where
american
citizens
are
brought
before
an
american
court
for
acts
which
violate
american
law,
even
if
those
acts
have
the
tangential
involvement
of
a
foreign
government...
in
sisal
sales
it
being
the
country
of
mexico
and
the
state
of
yucatan
and
in
continental
ore
it
being
a
canadian
agent,
exporter
in
canada...
that
nonetheless,
notwithstanding
those
tangential
involvements
of
the
foreign
countries,
the
american
federal
courts
can,
will,
and
should
decide
those
cases.
likewise,
i
can
take
it
to
the
broadest
extreme.
i'll
pass
for
the
moment
the
proposition
that
there
is
no
act
of
state
involved
here,
which
i
have
briefed
in
some
length.
and
likewise
i'll
pass
the
proposition
that
sabbatino,
when
you
read
its
analysis
and
apply
the
underlying
premises
to
this
case,
that
you
find
that
sabbatino
says
this
case
goes
forward
and
so,
too,
our
past
commercial
activity
exception
which
i
think
applies,
and,
indeed,
the
motivation
against
validity
argument
which
is
sometimes
advanced
and
which
the
third
circuit
followed.
to
say
to
you
that
i
think
in
the
broadest
reach
of
this
case
this
court
is
presented
with
the
opportunity
to
now
say
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
if
it
means
anything,
means
merely
that
in
a
case
where
foreign
relations
are
involved,
the
court
will
invite
the
state
department
to
express
its
views,
and
if
in
that
first
time
in
the
history
of
the
united
states
of
america,
the
state
department
says,
stay
your
hand,
we
will
then,
as
a
matter
of
federal
jurisprudence,
make
the
determination
of
whether
we
should
stay
our
hand
applying
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
what
i
mean
by
that
last
statement
is
this.
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
which
is
now
25
years
old
as
defined
by
sabbatino,
but
which
is
much
older
than
that...
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
i
suggest
with
respect,
has
done
nothing
more
than
give
rise
to
a
cottage
industry
amongst
the
law
professors
and
the
law
commentators,
and
has
permitted
people
who
want
to
weep
crocodile
tears
for
places
like
the
country
of
nigeria
to
come
to
federal
court
and
say
we
ought
not
be
held
liable
for
our
wrongdoing
because
a
foreign
country
is
involved.
let
me
pause.
i
think
mr.
justice
stevens
put
his
finger
on
it
precisely.
this
case
would
not
be
here,
nor
would
we
be
without
our
verdict
and
judgment,
if
the
people
bribed
and
paid
off
had
been
an
american
company
or,
indeed,
if
it
had
been
an
american
government,
be
it
federal,
state
or
municipal.
the
act
of
state
doctrine
has
permitted
these
people...
and,
by
the
way,
the
depth
and
breadth
of
the
depravity
existing
in
terms
of
this
company
and
these
petitioners'
behavior
in
nigeria
is
set
forth
in
their
own
memoranda
on
pages
212
to
222
of
the
joint
appendix.
they
were
not
dealing
with
a
single
intermediary.
they
were
dealing
with
at
least
two.
and
this
went
on
for
over
a
year.
so
that
the
depth
and
breadth
of
what
occurred
here
is
amply
set
forth
in
the
record.
and
so,
too,
we
have
amply
set
forth
in
our
complaint,
paragraphs
39,
40,
and
41
of
the
complaint,
where
we
specifically
say,
but
for
this
conduct
in
nigeria,
and
in
london,
and
in
america,
by
these
petitioners,
we
would
have
had
this
contract.
we
would
have
had
the
profit.
therefore,
the
act
of
state
doctrine
has
simply
said
in
this
case
because
nigeria
is
involved,
these
petitioners,
these
wrongdoers,
get
some
special
benefit
which
would
not
exist
if
they
were
a
straight
american
corporation
or
american
government.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
no,
sir,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
number
one,
there
are
ample
cases,
as
you
know,
mr.
justice
stevens,
for
the
proposition
that
you
cannot
defend
an
antitrust
case
by
saying
you
are
one
too.
that
is
to
say,
you
cannot--
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
--it
is,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
first
answer
is
the
legal
answer
which
i've
suggested,
in
pari
delicto.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
well,
the
second
answer
is
that,
first
of
all,
how
will
they
prove
it.
but
more
importantly,
we
will
have
countervailing
evidence.
we
are
prepared
at
the
trial
of
the
case
to
go
forward
with
our
people
who
have
done
business
in
nigeria,
who
would
have
done
business
on
this
contract,
who
will
testify
au
contraire.
now,
that's
not
of
record,
mr.
justice
stevens,
but
i'd
represent
to
you
that
that
is
the
situation.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
that
may
be
so,
but
mr.
justice
stevens--
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
--i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
and
i
would
suggest
to
you,
sir,
that
it
really
makes
no
difference
when
you
look
at
what
the
republic
of
nigeria
has
done
in
response
to
my
request.
you
will
recall,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
as
it
appears
in
the
appendix,
i
asked
the
republic
of
nigeria,
through
its
ambassador,
to
take
a
position,
namely
that
we
could
go
forward
with
this
litigation.
they
have
not
responded.
that
suggests
to
me
that
that
answer
is
at
worst
neutral,
as
i
see
it
from
my
point
of
view
in
the
case.
it
is,
i
suggest
to
you,
a
positive
fact
in
my
case.
namely,
if
nigeria
seriously
didn't
want
to
have
the
corruption
in
a
previous
regime...
and
that,
too,
is
set
forth
in
our
appendix...
if
the
republic
of
nigeria
did
not
want
corruption
in
its
previous
regime
to
become
well
known,
they
would
by
now
have
stepped
forward
either
in
this
case
or
through
the
state
department
and
said,
please,
please
don't
disclose
to
the
whole
world
what's
going
on
in
nigeria.
therefore,
i
say
to
you,
mr.
justice
stevens,
that
their
suggested
defense
that
everybody
is
doing
it,
doing
it,
is
not
one
which
is
going
to
be,
(a)
admissible
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
(b)
will
not
fly
as
a
matter
of
fact.
and,
in
any
event,
it
is
not
something
worthy
of
consideration
by
this
court
in
deciding
whether
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
no,
mr.
justice
scalia,
i
obviously
did
not
say
what
i
intended
to
say
which
is--
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
--well,
if
you
look
at
the
last
few
pages
of
our
brief,
i
think
i've
said
it
there
at
greater
length
and
perhaps
with
greater
persuasion.
what
i
mean
to
say
is
this.
i
am
talking
in
terms
of
what
i
denominate
a
reverse
bernstein
rule,
which
is
to
say
that
rather
than
deal
with
a
straight
bernstein
exception,
which
has
been
adopted
by
some
members
of
this
court
and
by
lower
courts,
and
which
has
led
to
the
kind
of
criticism
that
mr.
brodsky
refers
to
from
mr.
justice
douglas,
what
i
am
saying
to
you
is
this,
and
i
think
it's
implicit
in
mr.
justice
white's
dissenting
opinion
in
sabbatino
and
other
cases
that
follow.
it's
simply
this.
the
court
or
the
litigants
notify
the
state
department
that
there
is
a...
quote...
act
of
state
issue
arising
in
this
case,
i.e.,
the
conduct
of
a
foreign
nation.
the
state
department
then
either
takes
a
position
or
not.
and
i'm
saying
to
you,
mr.
justice
scalia,
the
state
department,
so
far
as
my
research
shows,
has
never,
ever
stepped
up
and
said
to
a
court,
"don't
litigate
this
case".
the
most
they've
done
is
in
sabbatino
where
it's
a
no-comment
kind
of
letter.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
in
any
event,
sir,
my
proposed
procedure,
as
set
forth
in
the
brief
and
as
proposed
here
is
simply
this
on
the
over-arching
rule.
if
the
state
department
steps
forward
to
the
district
court
and
says,
you
ought
not
hear
this
case,
you
ought
to
pass
on
this
case,
you
should
defer
this
case
or
perhaps
even
dismiss
it,
the
court
then
responds
to
the
state
department
recommendation
either
by
accepting
it
or
rejecting
it,
subject
on
appeal
and
in
this
court
to
a
review
as
to
abuse
of
discretion.
that's
the
one
safeguard
that's
necessary
to
make
sure
that
the
state
department
is
not
playing
fast
and
loose.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
i
think
those
are
matters
remitted
to
the
executive
branch.
the
question
is
what
standard
should
the
court
apply
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
follow
the
suggestion.
for
example...
and
foolishly...
if
the
state
department
were
to
say,
please
don't
adjudicate
this
case
because
it
would
be
an
embarrassment
to
the
first
lady,
the
court
could
then
well
say,
well,
that's
not
a
very
good
reason
and
we
do
not
accept
that
reason.
if,
however,
the
state
department
says--
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
--may
i,
with
deference,
mr.
justice
kennedy,
disagree
with
that
because
the
political
issues
which
would
be
involved
in
the
state
department's
decision
in
whether
or
not
to
write
such
a
letter
are
not
matters
that
are
properly
within
the
purview
of
the
judiciary,
even
of
this
court.
all
this
court
can
do
is
to
say,
has
the
bernstein-type
representations
by
the
state
department
in
this
case
been
sufficient
in
order
for
the
court
to
properly
exercise
its
discretion
and
not
proceed?
i
would
be
candid
and
say
to
you
that
in
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
cases,
if
not
all
the
time,
the
answer
would
be
yes.
but
i
think
the
court
has
to,
in
deciding
how
to
handle
a
reverse
bernstein,
should
it
decide
to
take
that
course,
has
got
to
nonetheless
reserve
unto
itself
the
last
and
final
decision,
which
is
to
say
has
the
court
below
properly
conducted
itself
as
a
court,
after
we
have
the
representation
from
the
state
department.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
then
the
court
goes
ahead,
sir.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
no,
sir,
because,
again,
as
i've
said
to
mr.
justice
kennedy,
the
political
questions
that
would
be
involved
in
"embarrassment"--
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
--yes,
sir.
i
think
under
the
bernstein
exception,
or
under
any
other
careful
consideration
of
what
an
act
of
state
is
supposed
to
mean,
and
the
state
department
having
said
not
once
but
now
twice,
it
doesn't
matter
to
us,
please
feel
free
to
go
ahead,--
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
--even
if
it's
an
act
of
state,
yes
sir.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
there,
again,
sir,
i
suggest
that
given
the
proper
application
of
the
rule
that
the
case
goes
forward.
i'm
saying
to
you,
mr.
justice
white,
that
the
only
time
the
court
should
even
consider
staying
its
hand
is
when
the
state
department,
because
of
its
exercise
of
executive
powers
for
the
political
reasons
it
has
in
mind
says,
please
don't.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
absolutely.
but
i
say
it's
a
natural
corollary
of
your
opinion
in
sabbatino.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
well,--
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
--that's
exactly
right,
mr.
justice
white.
it
was
a
no
panel--
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
--but
let
me
remind
you
of
the
further
history
because
that
then
suggest
to
me
why
the
reworking
along
the
lines
i
have
suggested
is
necessary.
after
this
court
decided
sabbatino,
congress
passed
the
second
hickenlooper
amendment,
under
which
the
president
has
the
authority
to
step
up
in
any
expropriation
case
and
say,
please
do
not
hear
this
case.
they
have
never,
ever
exercised
that
authority.
in
fact,
when
sabbatino
went
back
to
the
lower
court,
the
state
department
declined
to
intervene.
so,
that's
one
of
the
reasons
i'm
suggesting
to
you,
in
line
with
perhaps
what
mr.
justice
scalia
suggested
in
asking
the
questions
of
mr.
brodsky,
i
think
it's
time
to
rethink
this
doctrine
and
turn
it
around
instead
of...
instead
of
making
all
of
these
lawsuits
in
this
court's
docket...
about
a
half
a
dozen
in
the
past
couple
of
years
on
petitions...
instead
of
having
these
lawsuits
around
and
law
review
professors
having
things
to
write
about,
let's
let
the
litigants
litigate
the
cases.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
absolutely,
mr.
justice--
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
--absolutely.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
i'm
doing
it,
sir,
because
i
have
said
that
there
are
several
levels
at
which
this
case
can
be
decided.
on
the
narrowest
ground,
as
i've
said
to
you,
under
sisal
sales
and
continental
ore,
i
win.
under
the
commercial
activity
exception,
i
prevail,
because
we
know
this
is
commercial
activity
by--
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
--yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
absolutely,
mr.
justice
white.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
but
as
you
said--
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
--absolutely
not.
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
it
may
embarrass--
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
--well,
it's
good
enough
for
my
purposes
to
satisfy
the
bernstein
exception,
hence
i
rely
upon
it,
mr.
justice
scalia.
but
it
is
the
fact
that
it
is
not
as
pellucid
as
one
might
desire.
but,
nonetheless,
as
you
pointed
out,
it
does
in
that
paragraph,
fulfill
the
bernstein
requirements.
and
now
judge
sofaer
has
done
it
again.
he's
given
us
another
letter
which
is
appended
to
the
solicitor
general's
brief
as
amicus
where
again
he
says,
whatever
weight
i
have
folks,
the
state
department
says
we
don't
mind.
that,
i
think,
as
mr.
justice
white
points
out,
is--
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
--well,
i...
in
deference--
mr.
thomas
b.
rutter
--mr.
justice
scalia,
i
think
what
he
says
is,
we
don't
mind,
but
please
don't
do
things
which
are
embarrassing
to
the
extent
you
can
avoid
it,
whatever
that
means.
in
any
event,
i
see
that
my
time
is
about
at
an
end.
unless
there
is
another
question
from
the
court,
i
would
simply
suggest
to
you,
as
i've
tried
to
suggest
in
the
response
to
mr.
justice
white,
we
can
solve
this
case
and
affirm
the
third
circuit,
as
we
properly
should,
on
any
of
several
levels.
i
invite
the
court
to
take
whichever
one
of
the
methods
which
i
have
suggested
in
my
brief
and
tried
to
suggest
to
you,
seems
most
appropriate.
however,
notwithstanding
mr.
justice
white's
suggestion,
i
don't
need
to
carry
the
burden.
as
a
lawyer
who
is
involved
in
federal
practice,
i
would
most
urge
this
court
to
consider...
to
consider...
redefining
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
thank
you
very
much
for
listening
to
me.
