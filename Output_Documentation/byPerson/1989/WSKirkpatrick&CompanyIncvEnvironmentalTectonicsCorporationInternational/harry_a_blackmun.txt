so
what
if...
so,
giving
all
the
deference
you
suggest
to
the
state
department's
letter
you
would
still
say
that...
that
the
court
should
make
an
independent
inquiry
as
to
whether
there
is
an
act...
the
act
of
state
doctrine
isn't
law.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--you
don't...
you're
not
taking
the
position
that
even
if
there
is
clearly
an
act
of
state
involved
in
this
case,
that
the
state
department
letter
should
determine
the
case?
