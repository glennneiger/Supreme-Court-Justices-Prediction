how
about
food
for
the
troops?
i
mean,
food
that's
going
to
be
used
by
the
army?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
stuff
wasn't
missiles.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
training...
training
equipment
for
pilots
of
the
sort--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
the
sort
that
commercial
airlines
might
well
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
brodsky,
why
do
you...
why
do
you...
you
know,
in
your
brief
and
also
in
your
oral
argument
you
asserted
that
the
letter
that
the
district
court
got
from...
from
judge
sofaer
was
very
ambiguous
and
unhelpful.
i
don't
think
it's
ambiguous
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
the
letter
says
very
clearly
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
does
not
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
answered
the
question
that,
you
know,
the
court
was
interested
in
squarely.
it
said
that
the
doctrine
only...
in
the
state
department's
view...
only
applies
to
the
inquiries
into
the
validity
of
foreign
government
acts,
not
into
the
background
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
rest
of
the
letter
said,
of
course
this
is
a
sensitive
case
and
be
careful.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
act
of
state
doctrine
it
was
dead
clear,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
apparently
the
solicitor
general
doesn't
agree
with
judge
sofaer.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
seem
to
have
been
copied
on
the
letter
either.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
a
lot
of
things
may.
that
doesn't
prove
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--lord
knows,
but
there
is
no
way
that
one
can
read
that
to
contradict
what
judge
sofaer
said
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
letter
quite
flatly,
which
is
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine...
whatever
else
may
apply...
the
act
of
state
doctrine
does
not
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
it
may
be
an
invitation
to
invent
some
new
doctrine,
which
invitation
you
may
be
accepting.
but
it
certainly...
it
certainly
does
not
speak
to
whether
it's
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
brodsky--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
of
our...
can
you
tell
us
which
of
our
cases
has
applied
the
act
of
state
doctrine
to
a
situation
in
which
the
validity
and
the
effectiveness
of
the
act
of
a
foreign
government
was
not
an
issue
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
it
is
invalid--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
nigerian
law
and
ineffective
internationally?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
that
if
the
plaintiff
can
show
that
the
contract
is
invalid,
the
plaintiff
would
lose
its
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
got
to
give
the
doctrine
a
new
name
then,
if
it
covers
this,
mr.
brodsky.
we'd
have
to
call
it
the
don't
embarrass
foreign
governments
doctrine,
or
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
misnomer
to
call
it
the
act
of
state
doctrine
then.
you're
saying
it
doesn't
matter
whether
there
is
an
act
of
state
involved
here,
it's
the
acceptance
of
bribery
by
state
officials,
contrary
to
state
law,
that
comes
under
the
act
of
state
doctrine
because
it
will
embarrass
our
diplomatic
relations
with
a
foreign
country.
we
ought
to
really
give
it
a
new
name
if
we
accept
your
theory.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
are
urging
upon
us
an
ancient
theory,
not
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
are
saying
it
comes
upon...
under
this
act
of
state
doctrine,
but
you
give
us
no
case
in
which
we've
ever
applied
it
to
anything
except
questioning
the
validity
of
an
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
to
protect
invasions
of
privacy.
but
that
doesn't
mean
you
can't
search
with
a
warrant.
i
mean,
yes,
the
act
of
state
doctrine
moves
toward
that
purpose
a
certain
step.
but
you're
saying
since
we've
moving
in
that
direction
we
go
all
the
way
and,
therefore,
anything
that
embarrasses
a
foreign
government,
not
just
calling
into
question
the
validity
of
its
acts...
anything
that
embarrasses
a
foreign
government
shouldn't
be
inquired
into.
that's
a
great
step
further
from
what
our--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rutter,
can
i
come
back
to
the
suggestion
you're
making
as
to
how
we
ought
to
handle
act
of
state
cases.
i
don't
remember
this
in
your
brief.
but
you're
suggesting
that
if
the
district
court
gets
a
representation
from
the
state
department
that
says,
go
right
ahead,
then,
in
reviewing
whether
that
district
court
correctly
applied
the
act
of
state
doctrine
or
not,
we
should
say
it
did
correctly
apply
it...
i'm
sorry...
it
did
correctly
not
apply
it
unless
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
ignore
the
state
department's
letter?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
i
didn't
hear
what
you
intended
me
to
hear,
i'll
put
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
they
knew
the
court
wouldn't
listen
to--
[laughter]
--for
nothing.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
even
have
a
very
good
bernstein
letter,
though.
i
mean,
this
isn't
a
letter
in
which
the
state
department
says,
go
right
ahead,
it's
not
going
to
embarrass
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
department
says,
go
right
ahead
because,
as
we
read
the
law,
the
act
of
state
doctrine
doesn't
apply.
now,
we
should
defer
to
the
state
department
as
to
whether
the
act
of
state
doctrine
applies
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
it
then
goes
on
to
say...
although
i've
got
to
admit
it's
going
to
embarrass
the
devil
out
of
us,
so
be
very
careful--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
seems
to
me
to
be
a
reverse
bernstein
letter.
i
don't
know
why
you
want
to
rely
on
that
letter.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
said,
we
do
mind,
but
as
we
read
the
law,
the
act
of
state
doctrine
doesn't
apply.
that's
how...
there's
no
other
way
to
read
that
letter.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
do
you
have
any
prior
case
that
supports
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
it
have
had
to?
wasn't...
wasn't
the
setting
aside
of
the
expropriation
at
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
third
circuit.
the
question
it
presents
is
whether
the
act
of
state
doctrine
bars
the
district
court
from
adjudicating
a
dispute
between
the
parties.
according
to
the
allegations
of
tectonics’
complaint,
kirkpatrick
company
and
tectonics
were
in
competition
for
a
particular
contract
form
the
republic
of
nigeria.
again,
according
to
those
allegations,
kirkpatrick
company
won
the
contract
by
bribing
certain
nigerian
officials.
tectonics
sued
kirkpatrick
company
certain
of
its
officers
and
others
under
various
federal
and
state
statutes
for
damages
from
the
loss
of
the
contract.
both
parties
agree
that
nigerian
law
prohibits
both
the
payment
and
the
receipt
of
such
bribes.
the
district
court
granted
petitioner’s
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
is
kirkpatrick’s
motion,
holding
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
barred
it
from
entertaining
a
cause
of
action
it
would
require
it
to
find
that
a
foreign
official’s
act
was
the
result
of
an
unlawful
motivation,
in
this
case,
the
receipt
of
bribes.
the
court
thought
that
such
a
finding
by
a
court
might
embarrass
the
executive
branch
in
its
dealings
with
the
republic
of
nigeria
and
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
which
was
designed
to
prevent
such
embarrassment
therefore,
barred
adjudication
of
the
dispute.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
disagreed
and
reversed
holding
that
there
was
nothing
in
this
case
to
indicate
the
judicial
inquiry
in
to
the
events
alleged
in
the
complaint
would,
in
any
way,
embarrass
the
conduct
of
foreign
relations
by
the
executive.
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
factual
predicate
for
the
application
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
absent
in
this
case.
nothing
in
the
present
suit
requires
a
court
to
declare
invalid
and
thus,
ineffective
as
a
rule
of
decision
the
official
act
of
a
foreign
sovereign.
it
is
not
enough
to
say
that
adjudication
of
the
dispute
might
cause
embarrassment
to
the
executive
in
conducting
affairs
with
the
republic
of
nigeria
that
such
a
concern
may
be
one
of
the
policies
underlying
the
act
of
state
doctrine
does
not
mean
that
the
doctrine
is
applicable
whenever
that
concern
is
implicated.
the
doctrine
is
not
a
rule
of
abstention
permitting
courts
to
refrain
from
adjudicating
controversies
whenever
to
do
so
would
cause
embarrassment
to
the
executive
branch
rather,
it
is
a
rule
of
decision
that
requires
courts
in
the
process
of
deciding
controversies
to
deem
valid
the
official
acts
of
foreign
sovereigns
performed
within
their
jurisdictions.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
is
affirmed
and
the
decision
is
unanimous.
