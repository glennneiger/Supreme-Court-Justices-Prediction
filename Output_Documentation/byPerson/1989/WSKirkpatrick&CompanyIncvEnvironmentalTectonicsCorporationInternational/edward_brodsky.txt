mr.
edward
brodsky
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
act
of
state
doctrine
bars
the
prosecution
by
the
plaintiff
of
this
action
which
we
say
that
it
does.
the
facts
are
as
follows.
in
1982
our
client,
w.s.
kirkpatrick
company,
entered
into
an
agreement
with
the
government
of
nigeria
to
supply
equipment
on
an
air
base,
a
military
air
base,
in
nigeria.
the
equipment
was
part
of...
was
to
be
used
in
an
aeromedical
center
in
nigeria
as
part
of
its
defense
program.
the
equipment
were
things
like
ejection
seats
for
jet
aircraft
and
centrifugal
machines
to
train
pilots.
in
connection
with
obtaining
this
contract
with
the
government
of
nigeria,
our
client
paid
an
intermediary,
not
an
official
of
the
government
of
nigeria...
our
client
paid
an
intermediary
an
amount
of
money
which,
pursuant
to
an
arrangement
with
the
intermediary,
was
to
be
used
as
bribes
to
officials
of
the
government
of
nigeria.
the
amount
of
money
paid
was
about
$1.7
million.
the
total
contract
price
was
about
$10
million.
in
1984,
our
company
was
indicted,
along
with
our
chief
executive
officer...
actually,
it
was
our
predecessor...
for
violating
the
foreign
corrupt
practices
act.
we
pleaded
guilty.
and
after
that,
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
brought
an
action
against
us
and
is
claiming
that
it
is
entitled
to
damages
because,
but
for
our
bribe,
it
would
have
obtained
the
contract.
it
is
suing
us
under
the
rico
statute,
under
the
robinson-patman
act,
and
it
is
suing
us
under
a
new
jersey
rico
statute.
it
is
not
suing
under
the
foreign
corrupt
practices
act.
the
district
court
agreed
with
our
position,
even
after
receiving
a
letter
from
the
legal
advisor
to
the
secretary
of
state.
that
letter
was
requested
by
the
district
court.
and
the
letter
that
was
received
by
the
district
court
was
kind
of
inconsistent,
internally
inconsistent.
one
the
one
hand,
it
said
that
the
state
department
had
no
objection
if
this
case
would
go
forward.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
it
also
said
that
discovery
in
this
case
might
seriously
affect...
that's
a
quote
from
the
letter...
might
seriously
affect
united
states
foreign
relations.
therefore,
the
district
court
said,
look,
i'm
not
a
member
of
the
state
department,
i'm
not
an
expert
in
foreign
relations
and
this
case
should
be
dismissed.
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
in
the
third
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
made
a
distinction
between
something
which
motivates
an
act
of
state...
namely,
in
this
case
we
say
the
act
of
state
is
the
awarding
of
the
contract
itself...
and
the
validity
of
a
contract.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
we
are
not
claiming...
we
disagree
with
this
position
of
the
court
of
appeals...
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
we
are
not
claiming
that
the
act
of
state
here,
namely
the
awarding
of
the
contract,
is
an
invalid
act.
we
are
simply
saying
that
the
contract
was
achieved
through
bad
motives,
through
a
bribe.
that
evidence
might
embarrass
the
government
of
nigeria
but
that,
the
court
of
appeals
says,
makes
no
difference.
it
makes
this
bright
line
distinction
between
motivation
and
validity.
when
the
court
of
appeals
did
that,
it
went
in
conflict
with
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
clayco
case
which
does
not
make
that
distinction.
and
that
case
we
say
on
the
facts
is
the
same
as
this
case
and,
therefore,
the
two
circuits
are
in
conflict.
first,
with
regard
to
the
motivation
validity
distinction.
in
the
first
place,
it
is
our
contention
here
that
in
order
for
the
plaintiff
to
prevail,
the
plaintiff
does
indeed
impinge
upon
the
validity
of
the
act
of
state
of
the
government
of
nigeria.
and
the
act
of
state
doctrine
says
that
the
courts
in
the
united
states
shall
not
examine
and
pass
judgment
upon
the
acts
of
foreign
governments.
now,
the
act
here...
the
act
of
state...
is
the
award
of
the
contract
and
what
the
plaintiff
is
saying
is
that
we
obtained
this
contract
through
the
payment
of
a
bribe;
we
obtained
this
contract,
they
say,
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
government
of
nigeria.
they
say
that
they
should
have
received
the
contract,
not
us.
and
in
doing
all
of
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
plaintiff
would
be
required
to
examine
the
procedures
of
the
award
of
the
contract
by
the
government
of
nigeria,
what
officials
get
involved
in
the
award
of
such
a
contract,
how
the
award
is
made.
the
complaint
in
this
case
doesn't
even
say
that
they
were
the
low
bidder.
they
do
say
elsewhere
in
the
record,
their
own
statement,
that
they
were
the
low
bidder.
but
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
or
anyplace
else
which
would
even
indicate
that
the
low
bidder
would
get
the
contract.
so,
what
they
would
be
doing
in
this
case
and
what
we
say
that
the
courts
in
the
united
states
should
not
be
doing,
is
examining
the
internal
workings
of
high
officials
in
the
government
of
nigeria
on
matters
which
directly
affect
the
government
of
nigeria
because
this
is
a
military
contract,
a
contract
that's
made
in
connection
with
the
air
force
of
the
government
of
nigeria.
mr.
edward
brodsky
no.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
would
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
but
this
is
more
than
examining
nigeria
law.
what
they
would
have
to
say
in
this
case...
this
court
would
have
to
say,
in
our
view...
is
that
the
contract
was
invalid.
it
was
made
for
the
wrong
purpose.
it
was
made
because
a
bribe
was
taken.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well,
that's
true
but
what
the
courts
do
not
do
is
to
say
that
when
the
foreign
government
entered
into
that
contract,
that
act,
that
contract
was
invalid.
mr.
edward
brodsky
oh,
yes.
yes,
indeed.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
don't
think
i
have
to
go
that
far
if
one
accepts
the
so-called
commercial
exception
to
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
but
i
say...
and,
indeed
again,
the
government
has
been
inconsistent
in
this
way
as
well...
even
the...
well,
first
of
all,
the
two
courts
below
say
that
the
commercial
exception
to
the
act
of
state
doctrine
would
not
apply
in
this
case.
the
solicitor
general,
in
his
amicus
brief
to
this
court,
said
the
same
thing.
now
the
solicitor
general...
yes...
seems
to
say...
seems
to
say,
because
even
the
brief
in
this
court
is
somewhat
inconsistent,
that
that
commercial
exception
would
apply.
but
i
do
not
believe
that
the
commercial
exception
to
the
act
of
state
doctrine
should
apply
in
this
case
because
we
weren't
dealing
with,
as
i
think
one
of
the
courts
said,
is
this
the
kind
of
an
agreement
that
a
company
ordinarily
would
enter
into
in
the
regular
course
of
commerce,
and
it's
not.
this
is
an
agreement
which
has
to
do
with
the
security
of
the
air
force,
the
military
of
the
government
of
nigeria.
if
anything
is
not
a
commercial
contract
which
would
come
within
the
commercial
exception,
such
as
we
had
in
the
dunhill
case
in
this
court...
it's
this
contract.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well,
in
my
view
it
would
not...
it
might
be
in
this
court's
view.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well,
yeah,
if
they
buy
fertilizer
for
a
farm.
i
think
if
there
is
a
commercial
exception,
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
it
would
apply
to.
yes,
i
would
think
so.
mr.
edward
brodsky
food
for
the
troops
gets
closer,
you
know,
as
a
fuzzy
area
as
far
as--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--no.
mr.
edward
brodsky
that's
correct.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well,
no.
not
ejection
seats.
not
centrifugal
force
machines
to
train
jet
pilots.
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
all
of
this
equipment
was
really
a
design
for
jet
aircraft--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--that's
used
in
warfare.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--yeah,
but
let's
look
at
the
rest
of
the
letter.
if
i
may--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--but
it
goes
further.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well,
it
was
dead
clear
in
the
sense
of
making
the
legal
distinction
which
the
state
department
makes
and
which
indeed
the
solicitor
general
says
is
wrong,
in
this
brief.
mr.
edward
brodsky
that
is
correct.
but--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--well,
we
told
him
what
the
position
was,
your
honor.
but
you
see
what
else
that
letter
says,
your
honor.
it
says
that
inquiries
into
the
motivation
and
validity
of
foreign
state's
actions
and
discovery
against
foreign
government
officials
may
seriously
affect
united
states
foreign
relations.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well,
if
i
may
answer
the
so
what--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--let
me
answer
the
so
what.
how
is
a
district
court
going
to
deal
with
that?
what
kind
of
rules
does
a
district
court
follow
when
the
district
court
judge
is
not
the
secretary
of
state;
he's
not
an
expert
in
foreign
relations?
mr.
edward
brodsky
well,
i
quite
agree
with
that
in
that
sense,
but
by
saying
that
it
doesn't
apply
and
in
the
same
breath
saying
to
the
district
court
judge
be
very
careful
because
there
are
foreign
policy
concerns
here
that
may
adversely
affect
the
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states,
what
we're
saying
is
that
although
his
conclusion
is...
he's
saying
to
the
district
court
and
later
to
this
court...
go
ahead
and
let
this
case
be
tried.
what
we're
saying
is
that
this
court
should
examine
that
very
closely
to
see
whether
or
not
in
its
judgment
this
case
should
be
tried.
not
to--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--well,
i...
look,
there's
no
dispute
about
what
the
letter
says.
the
secretary
of
state
says...
the
legal
advisor
to
the
secretary
of
state
says...
go
ahead
and
let
this
action
be
prosecuted,
which
goes
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
this
court
should
simply
listen,
without
itself
making
a
decision
or
having
rules
on
this
subject,
to
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
justice
douglas
in
the
citibank
case
said
that
to
do
that
would
make
this
court
nothing
more
than
an
errand
boy
with
respect
to
the
secretary
of
state,
nothing
more
than
an
errand
boy
for
the
secretary
of
state
to
decide
that
the
court,
rather
than
he,
should
decide
which
chestnuts
to
pull
out
of
the
fire
and
which
ones
to
leave
in
the
fire.
and
we
say
that
that...
that
rule,
if
you
will,
that
bernstein
exception...
while
the
secretary
of
state's
views,
we
would
agree,
should
be
considered
by
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
should
permit
an
action
like
this
to
proceed,
the
secretary
of
state's
view
should
not
be
the
final
word
on
the
subject.
the
final
word
on
the
subject
should
be
this
court's
views,
because
secretaries
of
states
come
and
go.
policies
change.
indeed,
the
very
policies,
arguments,
in
this
case
have
been,
we
say,
inconsistent.
when
the
plea
of
guilty
was
being
taken,
the
united
states
attorney
said
to
the
district
court...
and,
mind
you,
this
was
a
very
carefully
orchestrated
plea
of
guilty
in
this
sense
because
foreign
relations
sensibilities
were
very
important
to
the
government.
first
of
all,
the
indictment
itself
was
an
indictment
which
accused
us
of
paying
money
to
an
intermediary,
not
to
any
official
of
the
government
of
nigeria.
now,
the
government
which
is
charged
with
enforcing
the
foreign
corrupt
practices
act...
it
is
the
government
that
can
decide
what
kind
of
allegations
to
make
and
what
kind
of
allegations
not
to
make.
so
that,
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
government
very
carefully
decided
that
the
allegations
that
it
was
going
to
make
were
allegations
that
an
intermediary
receive
the
payment
rather
than
any
official
of
the
government
of
nigeria.
and
when
the
plea
of
guilty
was
being
taken,
the
united
states
attorney
was
very
careful
to
make
that
distinction
and
to
say
to
the
court
there
are
things
that
i
know
that
i
don't
want
to
reveal
to
the
court
because
of
what
may
happen
in
the
government
of
nigeria
as
a
result
of
this
prosecution.
mr.
edward
brodsky
yes?
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
don't
believe...
i
don't
believe
there
are
any.
and
we're
saying
that
that's
the
same
here
as
our
primary
argument.
i
mean,
we're
saying
that
this
case
is
not...
certainly
it's
different
on
the
facts,
but
it's
the
same
in
principle
to
sabbatino,
which
is
an
expropriation
case.
now,
this
is
a
government
contract
case.
but
what
we
are
saying
is
that,
inevitably,
the
proof
by
the
plaintiff
will
have
to
demonstrate
that
the
contract
that
we
entered
into
with
the
government
of
nigeria
was
an
invalid
contract.
so
we're
saying
it's
the
same
as
those
cases.
now...
in
other
words,
the
same
as--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--yes.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well,
i
think
that's
what
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
show
here.
in
other
words,
i
don't
think
that
the
two
concepts
can
live
together,
(a)
a
valid
contract
in
the
government
of
nigeria
but
(b)
coming
to
the
united
states
and
taking
out
profits...
indeed,
more
than
our
profits...
in
this
valid
contract
in
nigeria.
i
don't
think
you
can
say
it's
a
valid
contract
when
bribes
were
paid
to
get
that
contract
which
violated
nigerian
law,
at
least
the
stated
law.
now,
we
go
further
than
that,
and
that's
what
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
show
in
this
case.
that's
what
we
are
saying.
we
don't
think
the
two
concepts
can
live
together,
a
valid--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--no,
i
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i
think
that's
the
plaintiff's
theory.
i
don't
think
the
plaintiff
would
agree
in
this
court
that
he
has
to
go
that
far
as
to
show
it's
invalid.
but
that's
basically
what
he
has
to
show.
i
mean,
what
do
we
have
in
either
the
words
"validity"
and
"invalidity"
when
you
say
the
contract
is
valid
but
you
take
all
our
profits
away,
when
you
say
the
contract
was
valid
but
made
in
violation
of
nigerian
law,
i
think
you're
just
using
words
to
say
that
this
contract
is
invalid.
this
contract
has
no
validity
to
us
if
they
take
all
our
profits
away.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well,
you--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--that
is
correct.
but
what
else
is
going
on
here
is
that
they're
not
only
claiming
that
kind
of
a
violation...
they're
claiming
that
we
bribed
officials
to
get
this
contract.
they're
claiming
that
this
contract
was
made
in
violation
of
nigerian
law.
the
nigerian--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--i
don't
think
it
becomes
an
issue...
it
doesn't
become
important
in
those
cases.
mr.
edward
brodsky
oh,
because
the
contract
itself,
we
say,
is
the
act
of
state.
mr.
edward
brodsky
in
those
other
cases
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
contract
is
valid
or
invalid.
you
get
your
damages
and
nobody
argues
the--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--well,
because--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--well,
it
makes
a
difference
here
because
what
we
would
have
here
is
the
courts
in
the
united
states
examining
corruption
in
nigeria.
and
whether
you...
you
see,
i
want
to
make
the
second
argument
now.
whether
you
call
it
valid
or
invalid,
that
contract,
i
mean
our
position
is
the
same
as
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general
on
this
issue.
even
if
the
contract
is
valid,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
because
the
proof
is
really
the
important
thing
here
as
far
as
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
concerned.
the
proof
in
this
case,
whether
the
contract
is
valid
or
invalid,
will
be...
must
be
from
the
plaintiff's
point
of
view...
that
people
at
the
highest
level
of
government
in
nigeria
took
substantial
bribes
for
us
to
get
this
contract.
the
proof
also
will
be
because
it
will
be
part
of
the
defense,
that
not
only
did
they
take
bribes
in
this
case,
but
the
government
of
nigeria
lives
that
way.
you
get
a
contract
with
the
government
of
nigeria
by
paying
bribes
because
if
that's
true,
then
the
plaintiff
has
no
damages
in
this
case.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
proof
in
this
case
if
it
goes
ahead...
if
the
proof
in
this
case
shows
that
the
only
way
to
get
a
contract
with
the
government
of
nigeria
is
to
pay
a
bribe,
then
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
has
no
damages
because
it
couldn't
have
received
this
contract
without
paying
a
bribe.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well,
perhaps--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--your
honor,
if
i
win
this
case,
give
it
any
name
you
want
to.
no,
but
seriously--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
edward
brodsky
but
i
also...
you
also
don't
have
the
case,
your
honor,
not
to
this
date,
where
this
court
has
made
the
distinction
that
is
being
made
by
the
third
circuit
in
this
case.
that
is
the
distinction
between
embarrassment
and
validity.
this
court
has
never
made
that
distinction
yet.
so,
when
you
ask
me
for
a
case
on
that
subject,
we
don't
have
a
case
either
way.
in
that
sense,
if
you
disagree
with
my
first
argument
that
they
are
looking
at
the
validity
of
the
contract,
then
we
have
to
get
to
the
second
point,
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
this
court
will
indeed
make
that
distinction.
i
say,
and
the
solicitor
general
says,
that
there
should
be
no
distinction
because,
after
all,
when
you
look
at
the
purposes
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
it
really
doesn't
become
that
important
as
to
whether
or
not
you're
trying
to
declare
the
act
of
state
invalid.
the
real
important
thing
about
the
doctrine,
when
you
get
to
the
reason
for
it,
is
that
the
united
states
courts
will
be
looking
at
in
this
case
corruption
at
the
highest
level
of
the
government
of
nigeria.
that's
what
we're
trying
to
prevent
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well,
no,
i
think
the
case...
i
mean,
the
case
that
looks
this
way,
in
my
opinion,
is
the
sabbatino
case.
that
was
an
expropriation
case,
so
in
that
sense
distinguishable
on
the
facts.
but
when
you
look
at
sabbatino,
look
at
the
kind
of
allegations
that
the
claimant...
or
that
the
defendant
actually
in
that
case
was
making.
and
this
court
said
you
can't
hear
those
allegations.
things
like
property
was
being
taken,
discriminating
against
americans...
property
had
been
taken
by
the
government
of
cuba
without
just
compensation.
our
government
had--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--no,
the
court
did
not
make
that
analysis.
no,
it
did
not.
in
that
case
the
court
said
that,
because
it
was
an
act
of
state
that
was
the
end
of
it,
no
matter
what
else
might
flow
from
that.
but
i
look
at
the...
i
mean,
we're
not
just
using
those
words
in
the
abstract,
using
the
words
"act
of
state"
in
the
abstract.
the
purpose
is
what
i
am
looking
at
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
whether
it's
in
sabbatino
or
it's
in
any
of
the
other
cases
decided
by
this
court.
mr.
edward
brodsky
mr.
justice
scalia,
i
don't
go
that
far.
i
could...
i
could
perceive
of
situations
where
a
government
might
be
embarrassed
and
the
act
of
state
doctrine
would
not
apply.
but
not
this
case.
i
mean,
what
do
we
have
in
this
case?
corruption
at
the
highest
level
of
another
government.
and
that's
why
i
say
it
applies
in
this
case.
i
don't
take
the
position
that
every
time
a
different
government
might
be
embarrassed
you
don't
apply
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
mr.
edward
brodsky
i'm
not
sure
about
that,
your
honor.
it
seems
to
me
under
that...
because,
after
all,
what
we're
arguing
for
is
a
position
of
flexibility
for
the
courts
to
have.
what
we're
arguing
for
is
that
the
courts
should
consider--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--i
would
agree
with
that.
i'm
only
trying
to--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--that
if
somebody
in
the
united
states
violated
united
states
law
and
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
government
of
nigeria--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well,
i
would
think
if
there
were
people
in
high
office
in
the
united
states
that
were
violating
the
laws,
i
would
think
that
the
courts
would
certainly
want
to
get
into
that.
and
if--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--well,
because
we
have
different
concepts
as
far
as
that's
concerned.
we
don't
have
a
concept
involving
our
own
government
involving
the
act
of
state.
the
courts
in
the
united
states
look
at
what
the
government
does
and
it's
supposed
to
look
at
what
this
government
does,
but
not
the
government
of
nigeria
or
any
other
government.
that's
what
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is.
and
you
may
have--
mr.
edward
brodsky
--yes,
your
honor,
of
course.
that's
what
i
say
it
is,
your
honor.
of
course.
but,
i
mean,
what...
we
have
an
act
of
state
doctrine
in
the
first
place,
i
say,
so
that
the
kinds
of
things
that
might
be
adduced
in
a
case
like
this
will
not
be
adduced
in
american
courts.
i
see
that
i
have
a
short
time
remaining.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
edward
brodsky
well,
if
the
court
please,
first,
with
regard
to
the
second
letter
that
was
received
from
the
state
department,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
material
difference
between
the
two
letters.
the
second
letter
says
at
the
end,
the
legal
advisor
to
the
state
department
reminds
the
trial
court
to
exercise
appropriate
supervision
over
the
trial
process
so
as
to
limit
damage
to
foreign
sensibilities.
now,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
there
are
no
rules
for
a
district
court
to
follow
in
presiding
over
a
case
and
limiting
that
case
to
things
that
will
involve
foreign
sensibilities.
so,
for
that
reason,
and
all
the
other
reasons
that
i
have
given,
i
respectfully
suggest
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
should
apply
in
this
case.
thank
you.
