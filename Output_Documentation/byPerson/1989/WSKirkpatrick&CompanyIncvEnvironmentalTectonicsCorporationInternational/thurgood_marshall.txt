--mr.
brodsky,
imagine
a
case
where
there
were
allegations
of
corruption
in
high
officials
in
nigeria
and
the
united
states.
now,
courts
could
investigate
the
united
states
but
not
nigeria.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
need
any
flexibility
to
decide
whether
or
not
you
can
enforce
it
against
the
united
states
but
not
nigeria.
that
doesn't
take
flexibility.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
agree
with
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
not
what
i
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
there
were
two
groups
of
people
violating
the
law
together,
those
in
nigeria
in
high
office
and
those
in
the
united
states
in
high
office.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
why
not
nigeria?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
what
you
say
it
is.
