mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
supports
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
but
we
do
so
for
grounds...
on
reasons
that
are
narrower
than
those
that
the
court
of
appeals
itself
enunciated
and
also
those
that
have...
some
of
those
that
have
been
argued
by
respondent
in
this
court.
let
me
begin
by
addressing
the
threshold
question
of
whether
there
is
an
act
of
state
inquiry
required
in
this
case
or
not.
the
classic
or
traditional
formulation
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
is
that
it
applies
when
the
courts
are
called
to
question
or
inquire
into
the
validity
of
a
public
act
of
a
recognized
foreign
sovereign
within
its
own
territory.
in
terms
of
that
formulation,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
critical
inquiry
here
at
the
threshold
is
whether
this
case
will
involve
the
questioning
or
the
inquiring
into
the
validity
of
a
foreign
sovereign
act.
and,
more
precisely,
do
those
words
mean
only...
refer
only
to
a
direct
adjudication
of
the
legality
of
the
foreign
act
of
state,
which
appears
to
be
the
reading
that
respondent
implicitly
adopts
or
that
the
court
of
appeals
implicitly
adopted,
or
are
those
words
broad
and
flexible
enough
to
encompass
some
additional
types
of
cases
that
might
also
be
understood
as
inquiring
or
questioning
the
validity
of
a
foreign
act?
we
believe
that
this
case...
the
type
of
situation
of
this
case...
is
one
where
there
ought
to
be
an
act
of
state
inquiry.
that,
because
of
the
need
to
prove
causation
in
this
case,
the
case,
if
it
goes
forward,
could
establish
the
factual
predicate
which
would
establish
as
a
matter
of
nigerian
law
that
this
contract
is
either
void
or
voidable.
and
that
that
type
of
situation
sufficiently
implicates
the
general
policies
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine
that
at
least
an
inquiry
into
the
act
of
state
question
ought
to
be
undertaken.
second,
let
me
address
very
briefly
the
commercial
activities--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i
think
american
banana
at
least
provides
some
indirect
support
for
that,
justice
scalia.
remember,
in
that
case,
the
allegation
was
that
a
foreign
government,
costa
rica,
had
been
induced
by
an
american
company
to
engage
in
expropriate...
acts
of
essentially
expropriation
against
another
american
company.
it's
hard
to
read
the
case
as
saying
that
the
court,
if
it
head
the
case,
would
have
to
inquire
directly
into
the
legal
validity
of
the
acts
of
the
costa
rican
government,
but,
nevertheless,
this
court--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--no.
it
was
an
antitrust
action
brought
to
recover
damages
in
the
united
states
and
the
cause
of
the
damages
was
the
act
of
expropriation--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--but
the
defendant
who
was
alleged
to
have
violated
the
antitrust
laws
by
conspiracy
and
so
forth...
whether
their
conduct
was
legal
or
illegal
could
have
been
determined
without
determining
the
legality
of
the
expropriation
itself.
i
think
the
reaction
of
the
court
in
that
case
was
that
essentially
what
was
being
alleged
was
that
costa
rica
was
a
puppet
of
an
american
corporation
and
that
that
type
of
inquiry
was
of
sufficient...
had
sufficient
implications
for
the
conduct
of
america's
foreign
relations
that
such
an
inquiry
ought
not
to
be
permitted.
that
obviously
isn't
directly
parallel
to
this
case
and
the
two
are
obviously
distinguishable.
but
we
think
it
provides
at
least
some
inferential
support
for
the
proposition
that
the
narrowest
possible
reading
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine,
that
it
only
applies
where
there
is
a
direct
adjudication
of
illegality,
is
not
necessarily
one
that
this
court's
cases
require
that
it
adopt.
let
me
address
briefly
the
commercial
activities
exception.
we
agree
with
the
petitioners
that
this
act,
the
decision
to
enter
into
a
defense
procurement
act,
is
sufficiently
sovereign,
that
the
case
should
not,
by
that
reason
alone,
be
held
to
fall
within
the
commercial
activities
exception.
what
we
said
in
our
brief
was
that
it's
nevertheless
relevant
under
the
type
of
comity...
international
comity
analysis
that
the
court
has
undertaken
in
sabbatino
and
succeeding
cases,
that
the
relationship
the
parties
would
enter
into
once
this
decision
was
made
to
enter
into
the
contract
would
be
commercial
in
nature.
so,
for
example,
questions
about
breach
of
warranty,
questions
about
other
issues
that
might
come
up
in
the
governance
of
the
contractual
relationship
we
think,
for
example,
would
fall
into
the
commercial
exception
for
this
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
and
if
there
were
a
commercial
activities
exception
recognized,
would
presumably
also
those
questions
would
come
within
a
commercial
activities
exception
of
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
so,
because
the
relationship
that
would
be
entered
into
is
commercial,
we
think
that's
one
factor
that
the
court
could
weigh
under
a
comity
type
analysis
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
act
of
state
doctrine
precludes
giving
a
questioning...
or
not
giving
effect
to
the
act
of
a
foreign
sovereign.
i'd
also
like
to
speak,
if
i
could,
to
the
general
question
of
the
institutional
relationship
between
the
federal
courts
and
the
executive
branch
in
applying
the
act
of
state
doctrine.
it's
a
matter
that
this
court
has
not
spoken
to
in
an
opinion
enjoined
by
a
majority
of
the
court
and
is
also
of
some
considerable
institutional
interest
to
the
united
states.
the
position
that
we've
taken
in
our
brief
in
this
case
really
attempts
to
build
on
two
principles
that
we
think
there
is
a
fair
consensus
about
within
this
court's
opinions,
even
though
the
court
has
not
reached
a
concluded
view
about
them.
one
is
the
principle
that
the
courts,
of
course,
are
the
final
arbiters
of
question
of
law,
and
the
second
is
the
principle
that
the
executive
branch
ought
to
be
the
final
arbiter
of
questions
of
foreign
relations
and
foreign
policy.
and
the
way
we
propose
that
these
two
principles
can
be
reconciled
in
this
area
is
that
when
a
court
undertakes
an
act
of
state
inquiry
in
deciding
whether
or
not
the
act
of
state
doctrine
should
in
any
particular
case
preclude
examination
of
a
foreign
sovereign
act
that
any
questions
about
the
foreign
relations
impact,
about
sensitivities
of
foreign
governments,
about
the
consequences
for
ongoing
american
diplomatic
efforts,
that
those
questions
ought
to
be
referred
to
the
legal
advisor
of
the
state
department
through
the
justice
department
and
courts
should
give
the
very
greatest
deference
to
those
determinations.
but
that
the
legal
elements
of
the
doctrine,
including
the
threshold
questions
about
whether
it
is
or
is
not
an
act
of
state,
in
the
final
determination
after
the
courts
engaged
in
the
balancing
process
would,
of
course,
remain
for
the
courts
themselves.
we
think
that
this
reconciliation
is
one
that
is
consistent
with
all
this
court's
prior
opinions,
including
the
rejection
by
six
justices
in--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--we
think
the
court
should
not
question
the
foreign
policy
judgments.
and
to
the
extent
that
foreign
policy
judgments
are
a
very
important
element
in
the
calculus,
the
court
should
take
those
as
a
given.
but
other
elements
in
the
doctrine,
for
example,
the
question
of
whether
an
act
is
sufficiently
sovereign
to
trigger
the
act
of
state,
or
whether
or
not
the
act
took
place
within
the
territory
of
a
foreign
government,
those
questions--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--those
questions
are
the
kind,
of
course,
that
the
courts
could
determine
themselves.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
our
position
is
that
the
state
department
letter
is
not
a
trumping
device.
we
think
that
that's
the
reason
why
six
justices
primarily
rejected
the
bernstein
approach.
the
bernstein
approach
was
perceived
as
one
where
even
if
the
court
concluded
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
precludes
adjudication,
that
the
executive
could
come
in
and
say,
no,
we
want
you
to
go
ahead
anyway.
and
six
justices
in
the
first
national
city
case
thought
that
that
was
an
impermissible
relationship
between
the
executive
and
the
courts.
and
we
don't
question
that.
we
are
simply
suggesting
that
when
the
court
undertakes
the
sabbatino-type
analysis
looking
at
the
various
factors
in
the
case,
and
to
the
extent
that
those
factors
include
questions
like
what
will
be
the
impact
on
ongoing
diplomatic
efforts
of
the
executive,
that
it
should
refer
to
the
state
department
and
get
the
state
department's
views
on
those
questions.
in
this
particular
case,
there
were
two
letters,
as
has
been
noted.
the
letter
in
the
district
court
we
think
can
fairly
be
read
as
saying
that
there
would
be
no
adverse
impact
on
the
foreign
relations
of
the
united
states
if
the
case
goes
forward.
but
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
about
that,
we
think
that
reference
to
the
letter,
which
is
appended
to
our
brief,
should
resolve
it.
in
that
letter,
the
legal
advisor...
this
is
at
page
2(a)
of
the
appendix
in
our
brief...
states
quite
expressly
that
we
do
not
see
any
foreign
relations
obstacles
to
adjudication
of
this
case
on
the
merits
and
we
also
believe
that,
in
the
absence
of
a
representation
to
the
contrary,
the
courts
may
properly
assume
that
no
unacceptable
interference
with
u.s.
foreign
relations
will
occur
on
account
of
adjudication
of
like
cases.
so,
in
response
to
this
court's
grant
of
certiorari
the
state
department
has
undertaken
a
reevaluation
of
the
foreign
policy
implications
that
suits
of
this
type
present
and
has
determined
that,
as
a
general
matter
and
absent
a
representation
to
the
contrary,
we
do
not
see
sufficient
foreign
policy
obstacles
to
going
forward
and
considering
a
case
of
this
nature
on
the
merits.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
