well,
what
standards
does
the
state
department
follow
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
give
such
a
letter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
assuming
that
in
making
that
judgment
we're
saying
that
the
state
department
has
or
has
not
followed
an
appropriate
policy.
and
so
i
don't
think
it's
an
answer
for
you
to
say,
well,
the
state
department
can
do
whatever
it
wants.
i
assume
the
state
department
has
to
have
some
guidance
from
us
as
to
what
is
or
is
not
an
appropriate
answer.
