justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
state
department
says,
go
right
ahead?
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't...
the
court
then
doesn't
ask
any
questions?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
say
then
in
this
case
the...
the
case
is
over
because
you
have
a
representation
from
the
state
department
to
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
this
is...
even
if
this
is
an
act
of
state,
go
ahead.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
was
the
case
in
citibank.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
the
state
department
says,
sorry,
no
comment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a...
you
do
say,
then,
that
that
takes
a
reworking
of
our
past
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
was
the
sole
dissent.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
i
wouldn't
mind
reworking
it,
i
suppose.
[laughter]
but
it's
against
the
law.
it's
against
the
law
right
now
because
there
was
silence
in
sabbatino.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
went
ahead
and
held
that
the
act
of
state
doctrine
applied.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
certainly
are
making
an
argument
you
don't
need
to
make--
justice
byron
r.
white
--to
win
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
why
you'd
want
to
carry
a
big
load
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
just
on
the
bernstein
letter
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--just
on
the
state
department's
representation.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
matter
what
else
is
true.
