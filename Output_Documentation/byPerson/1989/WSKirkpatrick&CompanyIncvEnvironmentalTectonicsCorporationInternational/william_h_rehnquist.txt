chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
87-2066,
w.s.
kirkpatrick
&
company
versus
environmental
tectonics
corporation.
mr.
brodsky.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
of
state
doctrine
that
would
require
a
united
states
court
to
refrain
from
examining
nigerian
law--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
must
be
many
cases
in
which
one...
the
united
states
courts
will
examine
the
law
of
a
foreign
country
and
say
that
a
contract
was
or
was
not
valid
under
the
law
of
that
country.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
that
the
critical
factor
is
that
it
was
a
contract
by
the
government
of
nigeria?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
no
contract
entered
into
by
the
government
of
nigeria
could
be
examined
under
the
act
of
state
doctrine?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
if
nigeria...
if
the
nigerian
government
were
buying
fertilizer,
the
result
would
be
different
under
your
view
than
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
fertilizer
for
the
military,
but
fertilizer
for
farming.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
our
previous
act
of
state
doctrine
cases
don't
point
in
that
direction.
they
don't
suggest,
as
justice
scalia
said,
that
it
would
be
embarrassing
to
a
foreign
government
with
whom
we
have
friendly
relations
to
have
discovery
about
what
went
on
in
the
award
of
the
contract.
therefore,
the
court
shouldn't
hear
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
did
we
say
it
shouldn't
hear
it
because
it
might
embarrass
the
cuban
government?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
brodsky.
mr.
rutter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
rutter.
mr.
merrill,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
merrill.
mr.
brodsky,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
brodsky.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
87-2066,
kirkpatrick
and
company
versus
environmental
tectonics
corporation
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
