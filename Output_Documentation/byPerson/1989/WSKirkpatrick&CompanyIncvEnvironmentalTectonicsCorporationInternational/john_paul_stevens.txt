justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
that's
true
in
any
case
where
you're
suing
somebody
under
the
robinson-patman
act
or
under
lots
of
statutes.
you
take
away
the
defendant's
profits,
but
you
don't
set
aside
the
underlying
contract.
i
don't
understand
that
concept.
justice
john
paul
stevens
lots
of
times
you
recover
the
damages
that,
the
defendant...
the
profits
the
defendant
earned
out
of
a
contract
as
the
measure
of
damages
that
the
plaintiff
seeks
to
recover.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
is
that
any...
take
the
robinson-patman...
i
guess
one
of
their
counts
under
robinson-patman.
why
is
that
any
different
than
any
other
commercial
bribe
situation
where
you
say
the
purchasing
agent
was
paid
off
on
the
side
and
that
violates
a
lot
of
statutes?
you
don't
set
aside
the
underlying
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
is
it
important
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
does
it
make
a
difference
here--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
they
don't
have
to
prove
its
invalidity,
and
they
don't
think
they
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
rutter--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
is
correct
though,
isn't
it,
that
they
may
well
have
a
defense
that
you
wouldn't
have
had
the
contract
unless
you
were
willing
to
engage
in
the
same
kind
of
conduct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it's
not
in
pari
delicto.
it's
simply
that,
in
order
to
get
this
contract,
you
have
to
pay
off
the
officials
of
this
country.
that's
the
way
they've
done
business
for
a
long
time.
that's
the
way
the
french,
the
british,
and
all
the
other
countries
do
business
with
them
and
you
would
presume
you
would
have
to
have
done
the
same
thing.
it's
not
totally
unreasonable
to
assume
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
the
point.
it's
no
damages,
is
their
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
trying
to
predict
how
the
case
will
come
out.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
assume
that
the
inquiry
into
possible
corrupt
practices
in
this
government
may
be
broader
than
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
because
of
the
defense
they've
alleged
in
their
pleadings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
don't
know
if
that
makes
any
difference,
but
at
least
it's
certainly
something
we
have
to
think
about.
