justice
scalia
ms.
sogg,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
ohio
law?
suppose
a
young
woman
in
ohio
thinks
she
has
a
fatal
disease
and
wants
to
get
an
operation
which
she
thinks
is
necessary
to
eliminate
it,
and
let's
assume
her
parents
are
christian
scientists,
who
are
people
who
don't
believe
in...
in...
in
medical
procedures
of
that
sort.
under
ohio
law,
could
she...
and
she's
a
minor...
could
she
go...
go
into
a
medical
facility
and
get
that
operation
without
having
her
parents
notified?
justice
scalia
she
has...
she
has
a
right
to
do
it
without--
justice
scalia
--of
whatever
age?
justice
scalia
ms.
sogg,
i'm...
i'm...
i'm...
i...
you
went
by
me
on
the
mature
minor's
first
amendment
rights.
i...
i
don't...
the
fact
that
a
minor
is
mature
doesn't
make
the
minor
no
longer
a
minor,
does
it?
i
mean
for
first
amendment
purposes,
any...
any
more
than
anything
else?
justice
scalia
i
assume
a
parent,
even
a
parent
of
a
mature
minor,
can
prevent
that
minor
from
publishing
a
newspaper
if
the
parent
says
i
don't
want
you
to
public
the
newspaper,
no
matter
how
mature
the
minor
might
be--
justice
scalia
--isn't
that
so?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
we
are
talking
about
minors,
mature
or
not?
justice
scalia
rights
we
just
do
limit
at
18,
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--or
at
least
permit
the
parents
to
exercise
control
over.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
i'm
not
sure
you're
saying...
you're
saying
that
the...
that
the
child
may
be
able
to...
would
be
able
to
get
the
procedure
but
that
it
is
inevitable
that
the
parents
would
be
notified?
