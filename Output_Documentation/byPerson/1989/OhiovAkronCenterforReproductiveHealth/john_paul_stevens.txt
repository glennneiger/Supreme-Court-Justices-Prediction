justice
stevens
may
i
ask
about
the
notification?
is
this
the...
is
it
correct
that
the
notice
must
be
given
by
the
person
who
is
going
to
perform
the...
the
abortion?
justice
stevens
and
not
by
any...
what...
what
is
the
justification
for
that
limitation?
if
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
enable
the...
the
pregnant
minor
to
have
the
advice
and
counsel
of
the
parent,
what
difference
does
it
make
who
gives
the
notice?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
one
of
the
justifications
for
this
statute
is
to
give
the
physician
information
that
the
state
thinks
the
physician
needs?
justice
stevens
well,
if
the
physician
thought
the
information
was
necessary,
the
physician
could
always
call
up
and
ask
for
it;
that's
clear.
but
you're
saying
the
physician
must
do
it
even
if
the
physician
doesn't
think
the
information
is
necessary?
justice
stevens
the
protection
being
that
the
physician
might
not
realize
that
there
was
information
out
there
that
he
or
she
ought
to
get?
justice
stevens
well,
then,
is
that
one
of
the
factors
that
the
judge
has
to
take
into
account
in
the
bypass
procedure,
whether
there
is
need
for
the
transmittal
of
this
kind
of
information?
justice
stevens
well,
not
if
the...
not
if
there's
a
bypass
authorized?
justice
stevens
and
does
it...
how,
in
the
bypass
procedure,
do
you
protect
this
state
interest?
how
do
you
make
sure
that
the
doctor
gets
this
important
information?
justice
stevens
it's
just...
is
it
a
relevant
consideration
in
the
bypass
procedure?
does
the
judge
have
a
duty
to
make
some
kind
of
an
inquiry
into
the
need
for
this
kind
of
information?
justice
stevens
so
you're...
the
justification
for...
for
the
particular
procedure
that
ohio
has
is
not
just
to
enable
the
minor
and
the
parent
to
make
an
informed
decision,
but
also
to
be
sure
the
doctor
acts
wisely?
justice
stevens
well,
is
the
reason
for
the
parents'
participation
primarily
to
protect
the
minor's
health?
