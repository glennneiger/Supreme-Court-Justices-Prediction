chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
88-805,
ohio
v.
akron
center
for
reproductive
health.
ms.
eppler,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
eppler.
ms.
sogg,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
you
can
turn
the
lectern
down
if
you
want.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
would
be
quite
consistent
with
our
cases,
wouldn't
it,
to
say
that
the
state
may
encourage
people
to
come
for
drug
counseling,
suicidal
tendencies,
but
need
not
encourage
abortion
in
the
same
way?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
is
that,
ms.
sogg?
i
would
think
that
if
ohio
need
not
provide
a
bypass
procedure
at
all
under
the
federal
constitution,
it
wouldn't
make
much
difference
what
kind
of
a
one
it
actually
provides.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
entitlement
that
the
state
has
provided
here,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
property...
what
case
of
ours
do
you
think
comes
closest
to
say
that
the
state
has
provided
a
property
interest
by
enacting
this
procedure
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
sogg.
ms.
eppler,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
claiming
a
technical
battery
against
the
physician?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
eppler.
the
case
is
submitted.
