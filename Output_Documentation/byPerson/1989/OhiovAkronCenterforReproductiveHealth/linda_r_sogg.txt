either
that
or
grow.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
ohio
properly
determined
that
a
bypass
was
constitutionally
required
in
connection
with
its
parental
notification
statute.
but
although
ohio
claims
here
today
that
it
followed
the
constitutional
mandates
expressly
set
forth
by
this
court
in
bellotti,
the
fact
is
that
both
lower
courts
that
have
reviewed
the
statute
have
determined
properly
that
ohio
failed
miserably
to
implement
the
bellotti
standards
in
the
development
of
its
parental
notification
statute.
indeed,
what
ohio
has
accomplished
by
its
bypass
is
to
create
a
procedure
that
lulls
a
young,
vulnerable
minor
into
the
belief
that
her
rights
and
her
safety
will
be
protected,
and
then
stacks
the
decks
against
her.
the
ohio
bypass
stacks
the
decks
by
imposing
an
unprecedented
heightened
burden
of
proof,
a
clear
and
convincing
standard,
on
the
minor.
and
that
burden
of
proof
clearly
increases
the
chances
of
an
erroneous
and
harmful
outcome
for
her
when
she
comes
before
the
court
with
her
petition.
that
same
bypass
stacks
the
decks
against
the
minor
woman
by
creating
a
pleading
scheme
that
is
not
only
absolutely
contrary
to
the
intent
and
the
express
purpose
and
language
this
court
set
forth
in
bellotti,
but
that
is
misleading,
and
literally
encourages
an
erroneous
outcome
by
prohibiting
juvenile
judges
from
themselves
acting
in
conformity
with
bellotti
standards.
now
the
state
has
attempted
to
justify
before
and
has
again
today
asserted
as
a
justification
for
its
clear
and
convincing
standard,
burden
of
proof,
number
one,
that
this
is
not
a
state-initiated
proceeding.
that's
actually
incorrect.
the
fact
is
that
but
for
house
bill
319,
no
proceeding
would
be
necessary.
the
state
also
indicates
that
a
clear
and
convincing
burden
is
appropriate
in
this
circumstance
because
of
the
ex
parte
nature
of
the
proceeding,
and
because
parents
are
not
literally
there
to
dispute
their
daughter's
claim
of
maturity
or
best
interest.
in
the
first
instance,
the
very
purpose
of
this
bypass
proceeding
is
to
avoid
hostile
or
harmful
parental
involvement.
it
would
be
absurd;
it
would
be
a
legal
oxymoron
to
have
that
as
the
purpose
of
the
proceeding,
and
then
bemoan
the
fact
that
the
parents
are
not
present
to
be
involved
and
to
act
as
an
adversary
to
the
minor.
the
clear
and
convincing
standard,
furthermore,
goes
contrary
to
every
recent
case
decided
by
this
court
that
dealt
with
the
imposition
of
a
burden
of
proof,
where
that
burden
was
most
likely
to
deprive
an
individual
of
an
important
liberty
interest.
under
the
mathews
test
that
justice
o'connor
addressed
earlier,
it
is
clear
that
the
minor
has
the
private
liberty
interest,
and
a
substantial
interest
at
stake
in
this
proceeding.
and
i
think
we
can
safely
assume
that
this
young
woman
would
not
have
left
school
at
a
time
of
trauma
to
come
down
to
a
juvenile
court,
which
may
or
may
not
be
in
her
own
county
of
residence,
to
fill
out
these
forms
if
she
did
not
believe
deeply
and
strongly
that
she
needed
to
avoid
the
involvement
of
her
parents
in
this
important
decision.
having
done
so,
that
liberty
interest
should
not
be
the
subject
on
a
higher
burden
of
proof
risk
of
error,
but,
quite
the
contrary,
if
any
greater
burden
was
appropriate,
it
would
clearly
be
on
the
state
and
not
on
the
minor.
in
the
case
of
the
pleading
traps
as
they
were
characterized
by
the
sixth
circuit,
bellotti
could
not
be
more
clear
in
its
language
regarding
the
structure
of
the
hearing
at
which
a
minor
can
either
prove
her
maturity,
or
if
her
maturity
is
not
demonstrated
to
the
court,
that
the
court...
the
court
must
then
assess
whether
even
though
the
minor
is
not
mature
enough
to
make
her
own
informed
decision,
whether
or
not
that
abortion
is
still
in
her
best
interests.
most
often,
because
the
court
will
have
determined
that
there
has
been
a
history
or
a
pattern
of
abuse
of
that
minor,
ohio
in
setting
up
its
pleading
scheme
has
taken
that
structure
for
evaluation
from
the
judge
and
made
it
literally
russian
roulette
for
the
minor.
by
creating
pleading
forms
for
a
young
woman
unsophisticated,
unschooled
and
clearly--
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
--your
honor--
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
--most
probably
not,
your
honor,
at
the
point
that
the
complaint
is
filed.
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
it
would
appear
that
under
ohio
civil
rules,
if
a
lawyer,
once
appointed,
in
appearing
at
the
hearing
moved
the
court
for
such
an
amendment
it
would
be
possible.
however,
there
is
certainly
no
guarantee
that
the
court
would
grant
that
motion
and
allow
the
minor--
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
--that's
correct.
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
the
judge
would
have
that
discretion,
but--
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
--well,
the
view
that
it's
onerous,
your
honor,
is
based
on
the
view
that
there
is
no
justification
for
throwing
up
a
barricade
or
an
obstacle
to
a
minor
coming
into
the
court
and
being
able...
without
getting
a
lawyer
and
without
knowing
about
amendment,
be
able
to
present
her
case
in
a
meaningful
way
to
the
judge.
while
it
is
true
that
the
pleadings
could
be
amended,
what
we
are
doing
is
leaving
to
the
discretion
of
the
judge
the
issue
of
whether
he
or
she
is
going
to
respond,
and
it
is
exactly
that
kind
of
discretion
that
this
court
found
inappropriate
in
bellotti.
certainly
it
is
possible
to
cure
what
is
otherwise
an
unconstitutional
provision.
it
is
our
view,
however,
that
because
we
are
dealing
with
young
minors
and
because
the
stakes
are
high
for
them,
that
we
ought
not
to
take
those
risks,
that
the
law
ought
to
be
able
to
follow
the
lobby
because
nothing
is
accomplished
by
this
pleading
scheme.
if
the
state
had
a
reason,
an
argument,
to
say,
well,
yes,
we've
got
to
do
it
this
way...
it's
the
only
way
that
works,
it's
appropriate...
that
might
be
one
thing.
the
state
raises
no
such
claim
here.
they
have
not
made
any
attempt
to
justify
this
pleading
scheme.
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
yes,
mr.
justice,
she
can.
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
not
by
statutory
law,
your
honor,
but
ohio,
as
many
if
not
most
states
in
the
union,
have
case
law
that
establishes
what
is
known
as
the
mature
minor
rule,
and
that
permits
a
minor
to
give
consent
for
any
medical
procedure,
whether
emergency
or
not,
if
there
is
a
determination
that
that
minor
is
mature
enough
to
do
so.
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
actually,
of...
in
fact,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
cases
in
ohio
and...
and
elsewhere
tend
to
cluster
around
the
upper
teens
and
closer
to
the
age
of
emancipation,
but
the
fact
is
that
the
case
law
doesn't
indicate
any
specific
moment
in
time
chronologically
when
a
minor
can
take
advantage
of
the
mature
minor
rule.
now,
we're
all
aware
that
that
rule
is
for
the
protection
of
the
physician
and
of
course
part
of
our
concern
with
this
statute
has
been
the
protection
of
professionals...
physicians
in
the
state
of
ohio,
who,
should
they
make
a
slip
under
this
statute
and
perform
an
abortion
on
an
unemancipated
minor
without
notification,
for
any
number
of
reasons,
that
physician
would
be
subjected
to
criminal
penalties,
to
civil
penalties...
actually,
to
civil,
per
se,
liability,
and
to
the
loss
of
his
or
her
license
to
practice.
but
the
simple
answer
is
that
yes,
a
mature
minor
in
ohio
can
consent.
the
flip
side
of
that,
interestingly
enough,
is
that
ohio
has
really
singled
out
the
abortion
issue
for
notification,
because
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
under
ohio
law,
a
minor
who
goes
to
seek
medical
treatment
for
sexually
transmitted
diseases,
the
physician
is
prohibited
by
statute
from
notifying
a
parent.
in
the
same
way,
a
minor
who
seeks
treatment
for
drug
abuse
in
ohio,
the
physician
is
governed
by
a
similar
statute
that
prohibits
that
physician
from
notifying
a
parent
that
the
minor
has
sought
treatment
for
drug
abuse,
and
the
same
is
true,
of
course,
as
it
is
in
every
state
that
i
know
of,
that
a
minor
who
seeks
counseling
because
of
mental
health
and
suicidal
tendencies
is
given
absolute
confidentiality
for
any
treatment
they
receive
from
the
suicide
hotline.
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
appellees...
plaintiffs
have
never
disputed
the
fact
that
parents,
loving
parents,
can
play
an
important
role
in
the
guidance
of
vulnerable,
immature
children
who
benefit
from...
from
that
guidance,
and
have
recognized
that
this
court
has
indicated
that
certain
health
care
areas
ought
to
involve,
wherever
possible
and
appropriate,
a
loving,
supportive
parent.
this
same
court,
how...
however,
has
recognized,
in
cases
like
j.r./parham,
that
not
all
parents
are
loving,
and
in
the
intervening
year
since
matheson
and
parham
were
decided
by
this
court,
we
have
unfortunately
been
visited
by
too
many
stories,
too
many
statistics,
your
honor,
of
how
unloving
parents
can
be.
what
a
tragedy
that
this
country
has
the
type
of
parental
abuse
that
we
read
about
and
hear
about
on
a
daily
basis.
consequently,
although
we
have
agreed
that
loving
parents
ought
to
be
notified,
and
can
be
helpful
to
an
immature
minor
who
will
benefit
from
that
help,
we
have
heartily
disagreed
that
all
parents,
including
abusive
parents,
should
be
notified
and
thereby
place
a
minor
into
a
zone
of
danger
and
the
focus
of
this
court
has
repeatedly
been
on
providing
protections
for
minors
not
only
from
their...
for
their
parents'
involvement
but
from
their
parents'
abuse
as
well.
perhaps
no
issue
is
as
central
to
a
fair,
effective
and
meaningful
bypass
than
the
guarantee
of
anonymity.
the
ohio
statute
does
no
more
than
rhetorically
gloss
over
the
question
of
confidentiality,
and
the
folly
of
failing
to
provide
specific
guidelines
to
assure
anonymity
is
nowhere
better
illustrated
than
in
the
complaint
forms
promulgated
without
the
benefit
of
such
guidelines.
under
the
ohio
scheme,
a
minor
who
comes
to
court
must
sign
her
name
to
the
complaint,
and
if
she
has
no
attorney
with
her...
and
it's
fair
to
assume
that
most
young
women
will
not
come
accompanied
by
an
attorney...
she
must
also
provide
an
address
where
she
can
be
reached
during
the
course
of
the
court
proceeding,
an
address
which
presumably
would
be
a
home
address.
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
it
could
be,
certainly,
your
honor.
it
could
be
either
one.
that
minor
must
also,
no
less
than
four
times,
provide
the
names
of
her
parents
on
the
complaint
form.
the
state,
although
it
insists
that
it
has
provided
confidentiality,
makes
statements
that
ring
hollow
in
the
face
of
the
forms
that
the
minor
must
in
fact
deal
with
and,
indeed,
the
state
has
offered
no
justification
for
not
providing
in
the
statute
itself
specific
guidelines
to
be
followed
by
the
juvenile
court
in
order
to
guarantee
anonymity.
even
if
ohio's
bypass
was
not
so
obviously
defective,
house
bill
319
must
nevertheless
be
found
unconstitutional,
based
solely
on
the
requirement
that
the
physician
personally
notify
the
parent.
there
can
be
no
justification
whatsoever
for
requiring
a
highly
paid
professional
to
undertake
this
time-consuming
task
that
the
state
has
admitted
in
earlier
proceedings
is
merely
ministerial.
in
fact,
before
the
district
court
in
the
sixth
circuit,
the
state
made
no
claim
that
the
personal
notice
by
the
physician
was
to
effectuate
an
interest
in
the
health
of
the
minor.
that
claim,
that
justification,
has
only
just
arisen
before
this
court.
however,
the
state
does
not
explain
here
why
it
is
that
a
physician
interested
in
obtaining
information,
or
a
parent
interested
in
providing
information
to
a
physician,
cannot
do
so
following
the
actual
notification
by
some
other
competent
individual
such
as
a
nurse
or
a
counselor.
indeed,
to
ask
physicians
to
sit
down
with
telephone
books,
get
on
the
phone,
spend
hours
trying
to
locate
a
parent
at
home
or
at
work...
and
indeed
the
statute
says
if
you
can't
get
them
on
the
phone,
the
physician
is
required
to
personally
get
in
his
car
and
go
to
their
home
because
it
must
be
accomplished
personally.
to
ask
that,
on
the
speculative
justification
that
there
may
be
in
some
instance
some
medical
information
transmitted,
is
a
hollow
meritless
argument
because
that
information
can
always
be
transmitted,
and
in
the
case
of
a
mature
minor
presumably
can
be
transmitted
as
well
by
her
as
by
any
parent.
this
court
has
already
struck
down
a
similar
statute
in
akron
i
and
must
find
this
requirement
equally,
if
not
more,
offensive.
moreover,
even
if
this
court
should
hold
that
a
bypass
is
not
constitutionally
required
under
bellotti
standards,
the
fact
is
ohio
has
provided
such
a
bypass.
once
provided,
the
constitution
demands
that
the
bypass
procedure
be
fundamentally
fair.
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
the
fact
is,
your
honor,
that
this
court
has
held
in
cleveland
board
of
education
v.
loudermill,
in
goss
v.
lopez
and
in
a
number
of
other
cases
that
where
a
state
need
not
choose
to
create
an
entitlement,
it
can
choose
not
to
do
so.
however,
once
having
chosen
to
provide
that
entitlement,
that
procedure,
what
is
provided
must
be--
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
--the
state
has
provided
a
property
interest
for
the
minor
in
exercising
her
right
to
avoid
hostile
or
harmful
parental
involvement.
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
i
believe
goss
v.
lopez,
your
honor,
comes
the
closest.
it
also
dealt
with
minors
in
the
context
of
high
school
suspensions
and
as
a
former
high
school
principal,
i
can
tell
you
it's
a
case
we
all
knew
very
well.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
property
interest
for
the
minor
has
particular
significance
and
meaning
in
the
context
of
the
ohio
statute
because
the
consequences
of
the
bypass
being
unfair
and
unreliable
for
the
minor
are
lifelong
and
in
some
cases
can
be
disastrous.
consequently,
under
a
procedural
due
process
standard,
an
examination
of
house
bill
319
can
yield
but
one
conclusion,
and
that
is
the
bypass
fails
to
meet
even
the
most
minimal
rational
standard
of
review.
once
again,
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
our
burden
of
proof
in
this
case
can
hardly
be
said
to
provide
the
minor
with
a
meaningful
manner
of
exercising
her
right
to
an
exemption
as
that
right
is
granted
by
the
bypass.
certainly
the
pleading
traps
are
contrary
to
procedural
due
process
and
must
fail
under
that
test.
moreover,
the
expedition
flaws
in
the
statute
run
contrary
to
the
minor's
ability
to
get
a
fair
hearing
and
at
a
meaningful
time.
ohio
has
recognized
the
competence
of
mature
minors
and
has
expressed
that
competence
in
recognition
when
it
included
a
bypass
for
mature
minors
and
in
so
doing
acknowledged
that
a
mature
minor
woman
is
by
definition
a
woman
and
as
such
she
is
entitled
to
the
constitutional
right
of
privacy
extended
to
all
women
by
this
court.
forced
disclosure
in
any
context
and
by
any
means
for
that
woman
is
inarguably
a
substantial,
unjustifiable,
and
undue
burden
on
her
privacy
right,
a
burden
which
in
the
case
of
minors
dealing
with
a
parental
notification
law,
is
going
to
be
only
exacerbated
by
efforts
by
parents
to
interfere
with
the
minor
woman's
abortion
decision.
efforts
which
this
court
has
recognized
can
be
extremely
effective
where
minors
are
financially
dependent
or
susceptible
to
intimidation
as
was
the
case
with
the
plaintiff
in
our
case,
rachel
roe
who,
if
her
parents
had
been
notified,
faced
not
only
abuse,
but
faced
eviction
not
only
for
herself,
but
for
her
two-year-old
son
as
well.
nothing
in
this
court's
history
of
balancing
the
interests
of
parents
and
the
state
against
the
individual
liberties
guaranteed
to
minors
supports
the
conclusion
that
this
court
will
abandon
a
mature
minor's
privacy
right
any
more
than
it
will
abandon
a
minor's
first
amendment
right.
certainly
where
no
significant
or
compelling
interest
on
the
government's
part
justifies
such
an
abandonment,
this
court
will
not
subject
mature
minors
to
such
a
deprivation.
furthermore,
it
is
absurd
to
suggest
that
this
court
would
risk
the
physical
safety
of
immature
minor
women
without
some
overarching
justification,
and
surely
no
such
justification
exists
here.
for
young
women
like
rachel
roe,
our
discourse
this
morning
is
far
removed
from
their
need
for
confidentiality
or
their
fear
of
parental
retaliation
or
coercion.
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
that's
correct.
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
i...
i...
i
think
that--
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
--we
are
indeed.
i
think
we
limit...
and
the
court
has
been
willing
historically
to
limit...
the
rights
of
minors
in
recognition
of
their
minority
both
intellectually,
emotionally
and
chronologically.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
whether
we
look
at
tinker
or
these
cases,
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
more
mature
the
minor,
the
less
chronological
age
has
to
do
with
limiting
a
fundamental
right.
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
that's
correct.
ms.
linda
r.
sogg
that's
correct.
young
women
like
rachel
roe
welcome
the
support
of
loving
parents,
and
they
need
no
statute
to
seek
that
support,
but
they
are
counting
on
us
to
protect
their
personal
integrity
and
their
privacy
where
appropriate
and
to
protect
their
safety
wherever
possible.
we
cannot
and
we
must
not
let
them
down.
thank
you.
