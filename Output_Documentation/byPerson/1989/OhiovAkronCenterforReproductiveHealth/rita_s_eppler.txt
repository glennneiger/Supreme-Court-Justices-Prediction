ms.

s.
eppler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
presented
for
review
today
concerns
two
central
issues:
first,
does
ohio's
parental
notification
statute
as
facially
challenged
ensure
a
minor's
rights
to
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment;
and
second,
does
the
constitution
require
the
state
to
provide
a
bypass
procedure
for
a
pregnant
minor
seeking
to
avoid
parental
notification.
the
cardinal
principle
in
our
nation's
laws
is
that
states
are
entitled
to
enact
laws
designed
to
aid
parents
in
discharging
their
responsibilities
for
the
upbringing
of
their
children.
this
court
has
recognized
that
a
state
has
a
significant
interest
in
encouraging
an
unmarried
pregnant
minor
to
seek
the
help
and
advice
of
her
parents
in
making
the
grave
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
bear
a
child.
this
right
has
specifically
been
extended
to
permit
states
to
allow
parental
consent
for
a
minor
seeking
to
have
an
abortion
performed,
provided
that
an
expedient
and
confidential
alternative
to
consent
is
provided
for
a
mature
minor
or
a
minor
whose
best
interest
would
not
be
served.
if
the
state's
interests
are
strong
enough
to
justify
parental
consent,
certainly
they
are
strong
enough
to
support
also
parental
notification.
parents
can
provide
essential
medical
and
other
valuable
information
to
physicians,
including
information
about
medical
history,
psychological
history,
data
relevant
to
allergies,
drug
reactions,
past
diseases,
family
history.
this
information
may
not
always
be
available
to
the
minor
or,
if
available,
may
not
be
forthcoming
from
the
minor
if
she
believes
the
information
could
in
any
way
jeopardize
her
ability
to
have
the
abortion
performed.
in
addition,
informed
parents
are
in
a
position
to
provide
for
post-operative
type
of
complications
to
assure
that
there
is
proper
treatment
and
care
in
the
event
that
post-operative
complications
arise,
be
that
in
the...
in
the
nature
of
physical
complications
or
emotional.
ohio's
requirement
of
parental
notification
is
clearly
no
more
burdensome
than
a
consent
provision
and
balances
the
parents'
responsibility
for
the
upbringing
of
their
children
while
preserving
the
minor's
right
to
choose.
ohio
has
adopted
a
parental
notification
statute
that
contains
a
judicial
bypass
procedure
modeled
on
the
guidelines
provided
by
this
court
in
bellotti
ii.
while
the
lower
courts
have
acknowledged
that
ohio
has
the
right
and
the
authority
to
legislate
parental
involvement,
they
nonetheless
struck
down
ohio's
statute
based
on
judicially
manufactured
flaws.
in
a
facial
challenge
to
a
legislative
act,
this
court
has
given
clear
guidance
on
the
rules
of
statutory
construction.
the
challenger
must
establish
that
no
set
of
facts
or
circumstances
exist
under
which
the
act
would
be
considered
valid.
the
fact
that
the
statute
might
operate
unconstitutionally
under
some
conceivable
set
of
facts
or
circumstances
is
insufficient
to
render
a
statute
invalid
in
a
facial
challenge.
statutes
must
be
interpreted
in
a
manner
to
avoid
constitutional
difficulties
such
that
if
one
among
alternative
constructions
would
provide
for
an
unconstitutional
interpretation,
then
that
particular
interpretation
should
be
rejected
in
favor
of
another.
the
lower
courts
here
have
failed
to
adhere
to
these
fundamental
principles
of
statutory
construction
when
analyzing
ohio's
statute
presented
for
review.
specifically,
the
judicial
bypass
provisions
provide
a
framework
for
an
expedient
and
confidential
bypass
that
has,
in
fact,
an...
an
assurance
of
a
timely
resolution
of
the
minor's
petition
based
on
a
constructive
authorization
provision.
the
pleading
forms
allow
the
minor
to
put
into
issue
either
maturity
or
best
interest
but
do
not
compel
the
minor
to
plead
both
if
she
does
not
so
choose.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
your
honor,
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
proof
here
does,
in
fact,
provide
for
an
ability...
since
the
parents
are
not
going
to
be
represented
at
the
hearing,
the
state
has
decided
not
to
turn
this
into
an
adversarial
type
process,
so
the
state
is
not
represented,
and
there
needs
to
be
in
this
nonadversarial
ex
parte
type
of
proceeding
some
way
to
assure
a
reliable
result
in
the
outcome.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
yes,
your
honor.
when
analyzing
the
three-part
test
laid
out
in
mathews
v.
eldridge,
specifically
we
first
look
to
the
private
interest
affected.
in
this
instance,
it's
the
minor's
right
to
have
an
abortion
performed
without
notification
to
her
parent
and
not
simply
the
right
to
have
an
abortion
performed,
because
she
does
retain
her
right
to
choose
under
a
notification
statute.
secondly
is
the
question
of
who
bears
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
decision.
again,
in
an
ex
parte,
nonadversarial
process,
the
minor
here
is
the
only
party
and,
therefore,
is
the
only
party
that
can
bear
the
risk.
thirdly,
we
look
to
the
governmental
interest
or
the
state
interest
affected
here,
and
that
is
in
encouraging
a
pregnant
minor
to
seek
the
help
and
advice
of
her
parents
in
making
this
decision
and
in
protecting
the
minor's
health.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
your
honor,
it
is
the
state's
position
that
the
risk
can
only
here
be
borne
by
the
minor
since
she
is
the
only
party
involved,
based--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--your
honor,
the
minor
is
here
under
the
statute
represented
by
counsel
so
is
aided
in
her
presentation
before
the
court,
and
there
is
an
ability
to
present.
we
assume
the
evidence
will
go
forward
either
in
an
in-chambers
conference
or
in
a...
in
a
in
camera
type
of
proceeding
before
the
court
and
will
most
likely
simply
be
the
minor
presenting
her
evidence
with
her
counsel's
aid,
and
there
is
no
reason--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--your
honor,
it
is
the
definition
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
under
ohio
law
that
it's
more
than
a
mere
preponderance
but
not
to
the
extent
of
such
certainty
as
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
specifically,
the
ohio
case
is
analyzing
clear
and
convincing
to
say
it
does
not
mean
clear
and
unequivocable.
so
it's
clearly
simply
more
than
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
which,
in
the
state's
position,
is
reasonable
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
one
there
to
present
the
other
side
of
this
issue.
in
addition--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--your
honor,
i...
i
would
posit
that
the
minor
would
simply
be
able
to
tell
her
side
to
the
judge.
if
she
believes
she
is
sufficiently
mature,
most
likely
her
statements
alone
will
suffice,
and
if
the
judge--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--i
think
the
ability
to
answer
questions,
how
well
the
minor
is
able
to
articulate
what
her
particular
concerns
are
if
it
is
a
best
interest
question.
if
it's
maturity,
i
think
the
judge
in
many
instances
in
juvenile
proceedings
have
the
need
to
assess
maturity
level
to
determine
the
validity
of
a
minor's
claims
as
they
are
raised
before
the
juvenile
court.
so
this
would
not
be
anything
different
than
a
juvenile
judge
would
traditionally
be
required
to
analyze.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
your
honor,
specifically,
the
statute
provides
for
the
juvenile
level
to
be
heard
within
the
fifth...
by
the
fifth
business
day
but
as
soon
as
possible,
but
no
later
than
the
fifth
business
day.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
the
time?
your
honor,
since
this
is
a
facial
challenge
and
we
have
not
yet
had
the
opportunity
to
put
the
statute
into
play,
i
would
simply
be
speculating
to
answer
your
question.
my
assumption
is
that
the
hearings
would
be
rather
brief.
the
decision
based
on
the
evidence
presented
is
to
be
provided
immediately
at
the
conclusion
of
the
hearing
by
statute,
so
that
would
lend
credence
to
believe
that
the
hearing
would
be
fairly
brief
in
its
duration.
in
addition,
the
appellate
level
of
review
is
scheduled
to
take
place
within
nine
days
total,
four
days
for
filing
the
brief...
four
days
for
filing
the
appeal,
the
notice
of
appeal,
and
then
five
days
for
appellate
review
including
briefing,
oral
argument
and
disposition.
in
addition,
there
are
good
cause
provisions
that
allow
for
the
appellate
level
of
review
to
be
expedited
if
good
cause
is
shown.
consequently,
this
is
probably
one
of
the
most...
clearest
examples
of
the
lower
court's
overreaching.
what
they
did
is
take
a
nine-day
time
frame
at
appellate
level
of
review
and
turn
it
into
15
days
by
utilizing
a
hypothetical
situation
that
could
in
essence
only
occur
one
time
per
calendar
year
and
added
in
two
weekends
and
two
legal
holidays
to
turn
nine
days
into
15.
it
is
the
state's
position
here
that
the
20...
the
22-day
time
frame
arrived
at
for
determination
of
the
entire
level
of
review
would
in
fact
be
inappropriate.
but
even
assuming
that
the
22
days
is
correct,
the
statute
is
still
sufficiently
expeditious
to
comply
with
the
bellotti
ii
standards.
this
court
in
ashcroft
looked
to
something
akin
to
a
16
to
17-day
time
frame,
plus
an
undetermined
period
of
time
for
deliberation
and
decisionmaking
at
both
the
juvenile
and
appellate
levels
of
review
and
found
that
to
be
sufficiently...
sufficiently
expeditious.
in
addition,
the
ohio
statute
has
the
protection
of
a
constructive
authorization
provision
that
provides
for
the
minor
to
have
a
final
disposition
on
her
petition
despite
crowded
dockets
or
any
unforeseen
delays
or
problems
with
the
court.
disposition
on
the
minor's
petition
under
the
ohio
statute
cannot
be
delayed.
the
lower
courts
here
again
speculated
that
physicians
would
be
unwilling
to
perform
abortions
based
on
the
constructive
authorization
and
concluded
that
that
provision
was
an
undue
burden
on
the
minor's
rights.
this
type
of
speculation
again
has
no
place
in
a
facial
challenge
and
as
a
factual
matter
is
simply
incorrect.
the
ohio
courts
speak
through
their
journal.
there
is
no
reason
why
a
copy
of
the
complaint
coupled
with
the
journal
could
not
be
provided
to
a
physician
to
provide
tangible
proof
that
constructive
authorization
has
in
fact
taken
place.
in
addition,
since
the
minor
is
in
fact
represented
by
counsel
under
the
statute,
the...
the
ability
to
have
an
opportunity
to
confer
with
counsel
to
determine
that
the
constructive
authorization
has
taken
place
also
exists
for
the
physician.
so
to
assume
that
the
constructive
authorization
will
create
an
undue
burden
is
another
clear
example
of
the
lower
court's
failure
to
follow
this
court's
maxims
on
statutory
construction.
with
regard
to
the
statute's
provisions
and
the
ohio
ethics
laws
governing
the
conduct
of
court
employees,
they
both
combine
to
assure
the
confidentially
of
the
bypass
proceeding.
the
statute
specifically
prohibits
the
minor's
parents
from
being
notified
of
the
proceeding.
the
hearings
at
both
the
juvenile
and
appellate
levels
of
review
must
be
conducted
to
preserve
anonymity.
all
papers
and
records
at
both
the
juvenile
and
appellate
levels
of
review
are
specifically
to
be
kept
confidential,
and
are
exempt
from
the
ohio
public
records
law
that
would
allow
disclosure
to
the
public.
in
addition,
the
ohio
ethics
laws
subject
court
personnel
who
violate
the
confidentiality
of
these
proceedings
to
criminal
sanctions
and
fines,
including
imprisonment
as
well.
the
minor
here
is
required
to
sign
her
name
and
provide
an
address
where
she
can
be
reached
if
she
is
not
already
represented
by
counsel.
if
she
is
represented
by
counsel
she
need
not
provide
either
her
name
or
an
address
where
she
can
be
reached.
while
the
form
does
require
the
name
and
addresses
of
the
minor's
parents,
that
is
no
different
than
the
requirements
of
the...
of
the
consent
statute
that
was
examined
by
this
court
in
planned
parenthood
association
v.
ashcroft.
in
ashcroft,
while
the
minor
was
permitted
to
use
her
initials
and
had
the
ability
to
have
the
petition
signed
by
a
next
friend,
she
still
was
required
to
provide
the
name
and
address
of
her
parents.
the
ohio
statute
here
provides
a
proper
framework
to
preserve
the
confidentiality
of
the
proceedings.
the
lower
courts
here
have
failed
to
articulate
how
the
statute
would
endanger
the
anonymity
of
the
minor.
the
plaintiffs
here
irrationally
predict
that
court
personnel
facing
criminal
sanctions
will
cavalierly
disregard
the
minor's
rights.
this
type
of
speculation
and
prediction,
again,
have
no
place
in
a
facial
challenge.
ohio
has
taken
all
necessary
precautions
to
assure
the
minor's
confidentiality,
and
the
statute
provides
a
framework
to
fulfill
its
promise
not
to
disclose
the
minor's
identity
to
her
parents
or
to
the
public.
in
addition,
the
pleading
forms
allow
the
minor
to
file
a
complaint
containing
either
an
allegation
of
maturity
or
an
allegation
of
best
interest,
or
she
can
file
a
third
form
putting
both
into
issue.
but
the
minor
is
not
compelled
to
put
both
into
issue
if
she
so
chooses.
a
minor
here
has
the
opportunity
to
raise
both
claims
and,
in
fact,
on
the
third
form,
is
able
to
do
so.
under
bellotti
ii,
a
minor
specifically
is
not
compelled
to
put
both
claims
into
issue
against
her
will.
as
this
court
recognized
in
akron
v.
akron
center
for
reproductive
health,
and
in
ashcroft,
the
state
must
provide
an
alternative
procedure
whereby
the
minor
may
demonstrate
that
she
is
sufficiently
mature,
or
that
despite
her
immaturity,
the
abortion
would
be
in
her
best
interests.
the
minor
or
counsel
simply
must
indicate
which
claim
she
chooses
to
put
into
issue.
regardless
of
the
form
chosen,
the
minor
is
not
locked
into
that
choice.
in
addition,
there
are
extensive
procedural
safeguards
provided
for
in
the
statute
that
ensure
the
minors
opportunity
to
be
heard.
there
is
a
provision
for
appointed
counsel.
in
addition,
liberal
amendments
are
provided
for
in
both
the
ohio
juvenile
rules
of
procedures
and
the
ohio
civil
rules
of
procedure.
a
minor
would
be
permitted
to
amend
her
pleading
even
as
late
as
at
the
hearing,
if
that
was
in
fact
appropriate.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
yes,
your
honor.
that
was
a
question
that
was
addressed
by
the
lower
courts.
as
a
threshold
matter,
they
did
determine--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
it
is
the
state's
position
that
there
is
no
constitutional
mandate
to
a
bypass
procedure
in
a
notification
context.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
would
be
the
state's
position
that
there
is
no
constitutional
mandate
in
the
context
of
a
notification
statute
to
require
a
bypass
procedure.
however,
the
ohio
statute
does
contain
one,
and
is
in
fact
constitutional
as
it
is
presented
for
review
before
this
court.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
yes,
your
honor.
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
that
would
not
be
equally
constitutional
for
review.
but
again,
that
is
not
the
case
presented
for
review
from
ohio.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
your
honor,
specifically,
that
is
provided
for
the
physician
to
provide
notification
to
the
parent
to
properly
protect
the
minor's
health
interest
here.
it
is
the...
it
is
the
state's
position,
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
h.l.
v.
matheson,
that
adequate
medical
and
psychological
history
is
important
to
the
physician,
and
that
specifically
requiring
the
physician
to
obtain
the
information
from
a
parent
puts
that
physician
in
the
best
possible
position--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--yes,
your
honor,
to
allow
that
physician
to
maximize
information,
to--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--yes,
your
honor.
and
the
state's
interest
underlying
that
request
is
for
the
protection
of
the
minor's
health.
if--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
here,
specifically
involving
the
physician,
as
opposed
to
an
intermediary,
again,
protects
against
additional
delays
that
could
result
if
an
intermediary,
such
as
a
subordinate
or
the
alternative
provider
of
information
to
the
parent...
that
could
constitute
a
delay.
if
all
information
that
was
needed
was
not
initially
obtained
by
that
intermediary,
there
could
cause
a
need
for
multiple
conversations.
and
it
could
delay
the
proceeding,
and
the
minor's
health
could
be
put
at
risk.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
no,
your
honor,
because
in
each
instance
the
requirement
of
the
statute
does
have
the
physician
directly
communicating
with
the
parent.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
oh,
that...
yes,
your
honor
[inaudible].
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
i...
i
don't
believe
that
is
a
question
that
is
directly
addressed
by
the
bypass
procedure.
rather,
it
is--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--it
is
not
laid
out
for
in
the
statute,
your
honor.
it
would
be
the
state's
position
that
the
rationale
or
the
state
interest
underlying
the
need
for
direct
physician
involvement
would
be
present
for
any
child
that
is
going
to
have
the
abortion
performed,
because
that
child
would
not
be
in...
in
a
position
necessarily
to
have
all
the
information
that
would
be
relevant.
or,
the
state's
position
is
if
that
information
is
available,
the...
the
minor
may
not
be
forthcoming
with
it
if
she
believes
it
could
in
any
way
jeopardize
her
ability
to
have
the
abortion
performed.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
in
essence,
your
honor,
but
it
is
the
minor's
health
that
is
the
particular
state
interest
that
is
articulated.
it
is
the
fact
that
a...
an
informed
physician
will
be
able
to--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--and
encourage
parental
involvement
in
the
decision-making
of
the
minor;
both,
your
honor.
and
both
have
been
recognized
by
this
court
as
significant
interests
for
the
state
to
in
fact
protect.
in
addition,
the
lower
courts,
in
looking
at
the
physician
notification,
specifically
relied
on
akron
v.
akron
center
for
reproductive
health
to
conclude
that
physician
involvement
in
notification
was
unduly
burdensome.
akron
involved
a
municipal
ordinance
that
under
the
guise
of
informed
consent,
required
physicians
to
recite
a
litany
of
information
that
was
designed
to
deter
abortions.
this
court
concluded
that
the
information
was
in
fact
burdensome
and
involving
the
physician
did
not
directly
further
the
state's
interest
in
informed
consent.
the
ohio
provision
before
the
court
today,
however,
concerns
very
different
state
interest,
that
of
protecting
the
minor's
health
by
providing
information
to
the
physician
that
enhances
his
ability
to
provide
for
protection
of
the
minor's
health
and
exercise
his
best
medical
judgment.
the
direct
physician
involvement
here
does
enhance
the
state's
interest
and
does
permissibly
further
the
state's
legitimate
interest
here.
the
plaintiffs
and
the
district
court
have
presumed
that
physician
involvement
may
increase
the
cost
of
an
abortion.
there
is
no
basis
to
presume
any
increase
in
cost
will
result
from
this
typical
type
of
physician/patient
type
of
communication
to
a
minor's
parent.
to
assume
in
this
facial
challenge
that
minor's
reactions
will
be
to
increase
the
cost
to
a
minor
seeking
an
abortion
is
unsupported
in
this
record,
and
again,
improper
in
a
facial
challenge.
with
regard
to
the
balance
of
the
consideration
of
the
pleading
forums
provided
for
in
the
ohio
statute,
there
are
extensive
procedural
safeguards
to
ensure
the
minor's
opportunity
to
be
heard
here,
appointed
counsel
and
the
liberal
ability
to
amend,
in
the
juvenile
and
the
civil
rules,
provide
for
the
ability
in
this
ex
parte
hearing
to
preserve
the
best
interests
of
the
child
and
give
counsel
wide
latitude
to
amend
whenever
it's
necessary.
the
lower
courts
here,
again,
assumed
incorrectly
that
once
a
pleading
was
filed,
the
minor
would
not
be
permitted
to
amend,
and
would
be
limited
to
the
claims
raised
in
her
pleadings.
the
lower
courts
here
simply
again
have
failed...
have
failed
to
adhere
to
the
fundamental
principles
of
statutory
construction,
and
have
looked
for
difficulties,
rather
than
avoiding
them.
where
a
statute
requires
only
parental
notification
prior
to
an
abortion
performed
on
a
minor
under
the
due
process
clause,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
need
for
a
bypass
procedure
is
the
question
that
this
court
left
open
eight
years
ago
in
h.l.
v.
matheson.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
the
lower
courts
erroneously
have
assumed
that
notice
is
tantamount
to
consent,
and
that
they
have
analyzed
the
ohio
statute
under
the
requirements
laid
out
by
the
bellotti
test.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
you
are
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
the
state's
position
that
since
the
lower
courts
did
look
at
this
as...
as
a
threshold
matter,
that
it
is
an
alternative
ground
for
the
court
to
reach
if
they
so
choose.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
that
is
correct.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
when
reviewed
facially,
the
statute
here
presents
no
undue
burden.
the
ohio
legislature
has
drafted
a
statute
that
strikes
a
balance,
allowing
the
opportunity
for
parental
involvement
when
their
daughter
is
facing
possibly
the
most
serious
dilemma
of
her
young
life,
while
at
the
same
time
preserving
the
minor's
rights
to
choose.
we
would
respectfully
request
this
court
to
reverse
the
sixth
circuit
determination
and
find
the
ohio
statute
constitutional.
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
thank
you,
your
honor.
initially,
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
regarding
emergency
treatment
that
a
parent
might
oppose
for
religious
reasons,
the
state
of
ohio
clearly
does
take
a
contrary
position
to
that
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
the
state
of
ohio
believes
that
there
is
no
mature
minor
exception
recognized
in
ohio.
first
of
all,
under
the
scenario
that...
that
you
have
presented,
your
honor,
there
would
be
an
ability
for
the
appointment
of
a
guardian
ad
litem
for
temporary
custody
under
ohio
revised
code
2151,
and,
in
fact,
parents
would
then
be
required
to
go
to
court
to
determine
if
the
temporary
custody
of
their
child
should
be
withdrawn
to
permit
the
surgery
to
go
forward.
in
addition,
with
regard
to
general
standards,
in
the--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
through
the
juvenile
court
proceeding
prior
to
taking
temporary
custody
away
from
the
parent
under
all
situations,
there
would
be
a
requirement
of
parental
notification.
in
addition,
with
regard
to
the
general...
general
standards
in
the
medical
profession
that
would
govern,
there
would
be
a
need
for
consent
to
be
provided
by
a
parent
prior
to
any
invasive
medical
procedure
performed
on
a
minor.
as
evidence
of
this
fact
are
the
statutes
that
have
been
cited
to
for
specific
exceptions
provided
for
either
emergency
care
for
diagnosis
and
treatment
of
drug
and
alcohol
rehabilitation
and
treatment
and
for
sexually
transmitted
diseases.
these
exceptions
are,
in
fact,
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
requiring
parental
consent
prior
to
invasive
medical
procedures
being
performed
on
a
minor
within
the
state
of
ohio.
clearly,
the...
the
law
on
informed
consent
has...
has
evolved
a
great
deal
since
the
1956
case
that
i
believe
my
opponent
relies
on
and
cited
to
in
her
brief,
that
of
lacey
v.
laird.
and,
in
fact,
that
specific
case
dealt
with
an
18-year
old
who
was
requesting
elective
surgery
without
the
consent
of
her
parents.
that
was
at
a
time
when
the
age
of
majority
was
21
within
the
state
of
ohio,
and,
in
fact,
it
was
an
allegation
or
a
challenge
by
the
minor
claiming
a
technical
battery.
clearly,
the
law
has
evolved
considerably
since
that
time
period,
and
the
general--
ms.
rita
s.
eppler
--that
is
correct,
your
honor;
for
technical
battery,
assault
and
malpractice.
and
the
case
analyzed
the
question
of...
of
whether
or
not
that
physician
was
liable,
found
that
he
was
not
because
this
18-year
old
minor
was
sufficiently
mature
to
have
consented
to
the
procedure
of...
of
an
elective
nature,
and
also
found
that
the
parents
should
not
be
financially
responsible
for
a
procedure
that
was
elective
in
nature
or
non-necessary
and
one
that
they
had
not
already
consented
to.
in
addition,
with
regard
to
the
burden
of
proof
questions
raised,
there
is
no
question
but
that
the
private
interest
affected
here
should,
in
fact,
be
looked
at
as
this
court
similarly
did
in
parham
v.
j.r.--
under
the
mathews
interest,
there
was
again
a
liberty
interest
claimed
there,
and
the
state's
interest
there
was
found
to
be
inextricably
linked
with
the
parents'
interest
in
the
custody
and
the
obligations
for
the
welfare
and
the
health
of
the
child.
particularly
there,
the
conclusion
of
the
court
was
that
the
private
interest
at
stake
was
a
combination
of
both
the
child's
and
the
parents'
interest.
likewise
is
the
case
in
the
state
of
ohio
statute
presented
for
review.
with
regard
to
physician
notification,
my
opponent
has
indicated
that
the
physician
would
be
required
to
spend
hours
attempting
to
locate
parents.
that
simply
is
not
what
is
anticipated
by
the
ohio
statutory
scheme.
in
fact,
specifically
section
29...
2919.12(b)(2)
that
appears
at
page
49
to
50
in
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix,
would
show
otherwise.
there
is
an
ability
for
constructive
authorization...
or
constructive
notice...
excuse
me,
your
honors...
to
be
presented
by
certified
mail
and
ordinary
mail
to
be
sent,
and
that
that
would
be
sufficient
if
reasonable
efforts
fail
at
originally
notifying
the
parent
personally.
with
regard
to
my
opponent's
questions
raised
on
due
process
of
whether
the
statute
creates
any...
any
property
interest,
it
is
clearly
the
state's
position
that
there
can
be
no
claim
to
a
property
interest
in
a
benefit
or
foreign
individual
here
unless
there
is
more
than
an
abstract
right
or
a
unilateral
expectation.
there
must
in
fact
be
a
legitimate
claim
of
entitlement.
the
ohio
statute
here
creates
no
such
claim.
if
there
is
any
expectation
or
entitlement
created
whatsoever
by
the
statute,
it
would
be
for
a
parent
expecting
to
be
notified
that
a
child
was
being...
was,
in
fact,
going
to
have
an
abortion
performed,
not
to
the
contrary.
regardless,
even
if
this
court
does
find
any
type
of
a
property
interest
created
by
the
statute,
it
does,
in
fact,
provide
the
minor
with
notice
and
an
opportunity
for
a
meaningful
hearing
in
a
meaningful
manner
with
all
of
the
extensive
procedural
safeguards
that
are
provided
by
the
statute
including
appointed
counsel
and
the
ability
to
have
an
appellate
level
of
review
of
the
decision.
clearly,
it
should
be
kept
in
mind
that
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
comments
with
regard
to
the
particular
plaintiffs
at
issue
here
clearly
have
no
place
again
in
a
facial
challenge.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you,
your
honors.
