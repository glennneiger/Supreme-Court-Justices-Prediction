what
about
the
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard
that's
required?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
test
do
you
apply?
the
mathews/eldridge
test?
justice
o'connor
and
what
about
the
risk
of
erroneous
deprivation?
justice
o'connor
but
it
increases
the
risk
of
erroneous
deprivation
by
increasing
the
burden
of
proof,
of
course.
justice
o'connor
and
you
have
an
unsophisticated
minor,
presumably,
trying
to
handle
these
things.
what
kind
of
evidence
would
suffice?
justice
o'connor
and
what
evidence
would
suffice
to
meet
the
standard
of
clear
and
convincing?
justice
o'connor
ms.
eppler,
it
isn't
altogether
clear
to
me
why
that
question
has
to
be
decided,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
state
has
decided
to
have
a
bypass
procedure.
justice
o'connor
but
not
necessary--
justice
o'connor
--to
the
decision?
justice
o'connor
is
there
no
right
to
counsel,
here?
justice
o'connor
will
there
be
a
lawyer
under
the
scheme
who
can
address
the
pleading
question
on...
on
behalf
of
the
young
woman?
justice
o'connor
can
it
be
amended
after
it's
filed?
justice
o'connor
but
under
ohio
law,
normally
it
would
be
granted.
there
is
no
one
there
to
oppose
it,
right?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
it
just...
it
strikes
me
that
the
argument
is
a
bit
strained
that
the
pleading
requirement
is
particularly
onerous.
justice
o'connor
well,
not
necessarily.
maybe
it
could
be
the
physician's
address.
