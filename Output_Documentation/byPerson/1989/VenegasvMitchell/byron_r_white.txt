justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr....
there's
no
issue
in
this
case
about
what
the
defendant
would
have
to
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
the...
the
lodestar
amount
is
all
that
he
has
to
pay?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
the
district...
i
thought
the
district
court
really
only
made...
it
made
some
remarks
about
it
that
really
left
it
to
the
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
said
it
was
really
a
matter
of...
for
state
law
to
take
care
of,
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
the
validity
of
every
contract...
contingent
fee
contract
in
a
case
that's
tried
in
federal
court...
the
validity
of
that
contract
is
a
matter
of
federal
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
it
a
matter
of?
justice
byron
r.
white
with
reference
to
what
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
is
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
--federal
law
issue,
the
validity
of
that
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's...
let's
assume
that
this
contract
is
completely
valid
and
enforceable
in
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
this
case
had
been
tried
in
state
court,
the
contingency
fee
contract
would
have
been
enforceable
and
valid.
no
questions
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may...
that
may
be
so.
but
let's
just
assume
that
it
would
be
enforceable
in
state
court.
why
should
the...
what
basis
does
the
federal
court
have,
other
than
the
policy
of
the
civil
rights
statute,
to...
not
to
enforce
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
it
determines
it's
unreasonable,
it
won't
enforce
it.
so
it
is
a
question
of
enforceability.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
can
understand
the
court...
maybe
a
federal
court
saying,
well,
we've
got
this
matter
before
us,
we
might
as
well
deal
with
this
contingent
fee
contract,
but
then
saying
it's
a...
it's
a
matter
of
state
law
and
we'll
just...
we'll
find
out
what
the
state
law
is
and
then...
and
apply
state
law
to
it.
not
some
independent
federal
standard.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we've
never...
we've
never
held
that
contingency...
recognition
of
the
contingent
nature
of
the...
of
the
recovery
is
not
a
legitimate
factor
in
calculating
a
reasonable
fee.
we've
said
a
lot
of
things
about
it,
but
we've
never
said
that
1988
forbids
in
all
cases
the
recognition
of
the
contingence
nature
of
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
in
this
very
case,
i
understand
the
reasonable
fee
that
was
calculated
included
a
contingency
factor.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what...
what
was
left
open
with
respect
to
the
lien?
is
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
accept
the
notion
that
the...
that
in
setting
the
fee
in
this
case
that
the
defendant
had
to
pay
that
the
district
court
was...
was
indicating
that
this
is
the
kind
of...
if
i
award
this
kind
of
a
fee,
it
is
the
kind
of
a
fee
that
would
enable
the
plaintiff
in
this
kind
of
a
case
to
get
decent
counsel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
a
reasonable
fee
that
district
courts
are
supposed
to
award
are
fees
that
respond
to
the
marketplace
and
that
would
enable
civil
rights
plaintiffs
to
get
decent
counsel.
now,
i
suppose
that
this
fee
that
the
district
court
awarded
was
that
kind
of
a
fee
in
his
mind.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
nevertheless
went
ahead
and
said
the...
but
nevertheless
even
though...
even
though
a
fee
of
this
kind
would
have
been
plenty
enough...
good
enough
to
get
a...
get
counsel,
this
contract
means
that
the
lawyer
is
entitled
to
something
more.
justice
byron
r.
white
secondly,
we
affirm
unanimously
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
in
88-1725,
venegas
against
mitchell.
