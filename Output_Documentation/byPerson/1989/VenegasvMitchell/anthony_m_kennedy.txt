justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
we
held
that?
have
we
confirmed
that
authority
in
the
district
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
does
that
supervision
go
to
all
aspects
of
the
contract?
its...
its
validity,
its
execution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
he
have...
did
venegas
have
his
own
counsel
at
that
point,
or
was
he...
in
these
hearings
in
the
district
court?
that
is
to
say,
a
counsel
other
than
mitchell
to
represent
him
on
this
contingency
fee
inquiry?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
apparently
none
of
the
parties
make
any
objection
to
the
authority
of
the
district
court
to
make
this
determination
and
whatever
the
determination
is
with
respect
to
the
contingency
fee
contract
that
is
going
to
be
binding
on
all
the
parties
for
state
law
purposes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
that...
that...
that
assumes...
and
you
know
what
opposing
counsel's
going
to
say...
that
that
assumes
that
he
would
have
gotten
the
amount
regardless
of
hiring
this
attorney.
but
he
made
a
different
judgment.
he
hired
this
attorney
because
he
thought
he'd
increase
the
amount,
and
he
may
well
have
been
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are...
are
you
referring
to
the
language
where
we
said,
"thus
it
is
that
a
plaintiff's
recovery
will
not
be
reduced
by
what
he
must
pay
his
counsel?
"
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
word
there
is
"must".
you...
it
is
not
required
that
you
must
have
a
contingency
fee
contract.
you
must
pay
him
a
reasonable
fee.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
word
must
means
you
must
hire
an
attorney,
but
you...
it's
not...
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
you
must
execute
a
contingency
fee
contract.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
whole
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
heard
it
right.
including
the
reasonable
attorney's
fee?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--did
the
settlement
agreement
also
contemplate
that
there
will
be
no
further
state
law
issues
raised
in
any
state
proceeding?
