mr.
richard
m.
mosk
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
civil
rights
case
is
whether
respondent
mitchell,
an
attorney,
can
by
enforcing
a
contingent
fee
contract
require
petitioner
juan
francisco
venegas,
who
is
the
client
and
the
prevailing
party
in
the
civil
right
action,
to
pay
over
$800,000
in
attorney's
fees
when
the
court
awarded,
pursuant
to
section
1988,
fees
in
the
amount
to
the
then-attorneys
of
$102,000,
which
was
almost
twice
the
amount
of
the
lodestar
and
twice
the
amount
requested
and
which
included
a
contingency
enhancement
factor.
in
short,
the
issue
is
whether
1988
is
to
operate
as
a
fee-sharing
statute
or
a
fee-shifting
statute.
now,
prior
to
mitchell
the
case
had
been
pending
some
eight
years.
all
of
the
discovery
had
been
completed.
all
of
the
law
and
motion
materials,
including
summary
judgment
motions,
appeals
and
pre-trials
had
been
completed.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
there
is
no
issue...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
it
was
a
projected
short
trial.
indeed
the...
in
volume
i
of
the
transcript
mr.
mitchell
himself
anticipated
a
four-day
trial.
there
was
a
high
probability
of
a
large
recovery,
in
that
in
the
state
court
a
jury
had
awarded
a
million
dollars,
which
was
reversed
on
the
basis
of
sovereign
immunity,
which,
of
course,
was
a
defense
not
available
in
a
civil
rights
action.
mr.
mitchell
had
mr.
venegas
pay
him
a
$10,000
non-refundable
retainer.
that
meant
he
kept
it
win,
lose
or
draw.
and
had
him
sign
his
standard
contingent
fee
contract,
which
provided
for
40
percent
of
the
recovery
for
one
trial
only,
plus
he
would
keep
any
civil
rights
award
which
exceeded
that
amount.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
well,
it
was
a
printed
form
contract,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
that
would
be
the
assumption,
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
there's
no
evidence
to
that
effect
other
than
it
appears
to
be
a
printed
form
contract.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
well,
it
is
our
position
that
it
is...
it
is
unusual.
and
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
when
it
said
that
mr.
venegas
had
the
burden
of
showing
that
40
percent
contingency
was
unusual
in
a
civil
rights
action,
never
drew
that
distinction,
that
this
was
40
percent
for
one
trial
only.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
way
petitioner
venegas
construed
it,
which
was
not
unreasonable,
was
that
if
he
lost,
mr.
mitchell
would
not
have
to
do
the
trial...
do
the
appeal
without
extra
consideration.
but
that
in
order
to
effect
the
recovery,
he
had
to
do
the
appeal
and
undertake
the
recovery.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
that
would
be
the
reasonable
way
of
interpreting
it,
not
the
way
mr.
mitchell
interpreted
it,
however.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
well,
your
honor,
the
answer
is
no,
not
by
rule.
it
is
our...
the
ninth
circuit
has
indicated,
and
all
courts
have
indicated
that
courts
are
supposed
to
supervise...
there
is
no
specific
regulation.
and
indeed,
the
district
court
in
this
case
simply
said
that
as
a
matter
of
law
a...
in
a
civil
rights
case
a
contingent
fee
agreement
is
enforceable
even
if
it
exceeds
the
amount
of
the
court-awarded
fee.
and
the
only
other
thing
that
the
district
court
said
was...
and
i
quote...
"plaintiff
does
not
claim
that
he
did
not
read
the
agreement
before
signing
it.
"
and
that
was
the
sum
total
of
the
district
court's
findings
and
consideration
of...
of
this
fact.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
no,
your
honor,
other
than
to
say
that
all
contingent
fee
agreements,
and
especially
in
civil
rights
cases,
when
called
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
the
court
has
a
duty
to
exercise
supervisory
power
over
them,
as
they
have
done
in...
in
every
court
throughout
the
nation.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
no,
your
honor,
you
have
not.
although,
as
i
said,
all
of
the
cases
seem
to
say...
and
including
the
one
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case...
has
said
that
contingent
fee
contracts
are
subject
to
the
supervision
of
the
court.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
it
goes
to
its
fairness
and
to
the
circumstances
surrounding
it.
just
as
an
example,
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
in
footnote
7
said
that
a...
when
there's
a
civil
rights
action
the
plaintiff's
attorney
may
not
get
both
the
court
award...
the
statutory
fee
and
the
contingent
fee.
now,
there's
nothing
anywhere
that
says
he
can't.
why
not?
freedom
of
contract
under
respondent's
theory,
but
that
was
a
rule
which
they
laid
down
themselves.
they
also,
in
hamner
v.
rios,
established
certain
criteria
and
guidelines
which
we
submit
were
not
followed
at
all
because
in
this
particular
case
the
court
placed
the
burden
upon
mr.
venegas
to
show
that
the
contract
was
unreasonable.
and
secondly,
it
completely
ignored
the
factors
related
to
the
execution
of
the
agreement
and
the
great
disparity
between
the
amount
asked
for
and
the
amount
that
was
deemed
to
be
reasonable.
and
finally,
didn't
consider
the...
how...
considered
a
contract
reasonable
which
is
manifestly
unenforceable
both
under
state
and
federal
law
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
client...
that
the
attorney
had
withdrawn
prior
to
the
advent
of
the
contingency.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
at
a...
at
a
point
in
time
after
mr.
mitchell,
who
was
counsel
of
record,
filed
his
lien,
at
some
point
at
the
hearing
itself
another
counsel
had
to
be
hired
and
was
hired
and
did
present
written
argument,
yes.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
the
answer
is
nobody
objected
to
the...
to
the
determination
as
such.
whether
it's
binding
or
not
is
another
question.
it's
our--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--no.
the
district
court
blessed
the
contract
as
reasonable,
as
did
the
ninth
circuit.
now--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--well,
except
for
what
we
consider
is
that
the
first
bastion,
the
first
guard,
is
the
court
itself
in
which
the
attorney
appears,
in
which
all
the
facts
are
demonstrated.
at
that
point,
it
is
up
to
the
court,
it
seems
to
us,
to--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--no,
your
honor.
but
if
a
contract--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--it
is
a
matter
of
the
federal
court
determining
at
that
stage,
as
they
have
in
many,
many
cases--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--in
reference
to
federal
law.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
yes,
it's
a--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--in
a
federal...
well,
it's
not
the
question
so
much
as
the
validity;
it's
the
question
of
the
regulation
of
the
attorney
and
the
reasonableness
of
it.
it
is
true
that
if
this...
if
this
court
determines,
for
example,
that
the...
that
the
contract
is
mr.
venegas
will
still
have
the
opportunity
in
state
court
to
litigate
questions
such
as
fraud.
but
in
state
court
the
issue
will
not
necessarily
arise.
it
may
in
some
context
as
to
the
"reasonableness".
it
is
for
the
court
itself
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
contract
before
it
is
legal.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
yeah.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
except
for
the...
the...
except
for
the
fracasse
v.
brent
withdrawal
aspect.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
because...
it's
not
a
question
of
not
enforcing
it,
your
honor.
it's
a
question
of
the
court
basically
determining
whether
under
these
circumstances
it
is
reasonable
or
unreasonable
to--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--well,
it
is
a
question
of
enforceability,
yes.
but
by...
the
flip
side
of
that
is
that
in
these
section
1988
cases
the
courts
have
in
effect
enforced
the
agreements.
for
example,
in
several
of
the
cases
cited
by
the
respondent,
the
court
has
said...
has
required
the
client
to
pay
his
attorney
the
difference
between
the
court
award
and
the
contingent
fee.
therefore,
part
of
the
court's
function
is
not...
is
to
protect
the
attorney
and
also
to
protect
the
client.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
well,
all
we're
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
it's
the
first
line
of
defense
because
an
attorney,
as
an
officer
of
the
court
before
whom
he
or
she
appeared,
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
attorney,
for
example,
is...
is...
is
taking
undue
advantage
of
his
client.
for
example,
if
the...
if
the
contract
had
been--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--right.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that,
number
one,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
the
court
should
not
enforce
a
contract...
contingent
fee
contract
where
the
lawyer
has
withdrawn
prior
to
the
advent
of
the
contingency
because
that
is
a
matter
of
general
law.
our
next
argument
is
that
a
federal
court
should
not
bless
or
deem
a
contract
to
be
reasonable
if
it
violates
state
law,
which
it
did
here
also.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
in
the...
in
the
second
item
where
we
deal
with
the
question
of
the
enforceability
of
the
agreement
basically
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
we
did
not
highlight
each
and
every
fact
situation,
but
in
our
brief
certainly
we
raised
that
issue.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
the
first
question
presented
really
goes
to
the
court's
ability
to...
which
it
has
done
in
each
and
every
case...
to
basically
take
what's
a
skeletal
statute
and
carry
out
its
purposes
and
intent
by
a
number
of
rules,
which
has
been
referred
to
by
judge
posner
in
his
book
on
federal
courts
as
a
type
of
federal
common
law.
for
instance,
let
me
give
one
example.
there
is
nothing
in
section
1988
that
provides
a
different
statutory
guideline
as
between
prevailing
plaintiffs
and
prevailing
defendants.
not
a
word.
and
indeed,
there
are
a
number
of
statutes
which
statutorily
provide
for
such
a
distinction
between
the
standard
for
defendants
and
for
plaintiffs.
the...
the...
one
of
them
is
the
hart-scott-rodino
antitrust
act,
the
petroleum
marketing
act.
a
number
of
acts
have
that
specific
distinction.
nevertheless,
this
court
in
hughes
v.
roe
in
1980
judicially
enacted
that...
different
standards
on
the
grounds
that
it
carries
out
the
purposes
and
the
intent
of
the
statute.
now,
respondent
has
simply
said,
well,
what
about
all
these
other
fee
limitation
statutes?
congress
knows
how
to
say
it
or
do
it
and,
therefore,
they
didn't
do
it
in
this
case.
and
the
answer
to
that
is
that
those
fee
limitation
statutes
are
basically
dedicated
toward
protecting
a
particular
group
of
people,
coal
miners,
for
example.
they
also...
the
purpose
is
to
protect
the
federal
fisc
because
they
are
normally
federal
statutes,
and
in
some
instances
to
make
the
process
less
adversarial.
here
we
have
a
fee
shifting
contract
which
is
not
a
fee
limitation
at
all.
there
is
no
limitation
on
what
the
attorney
can
obtain.
basically,
the
only
limitation
is
what
the
court
deems
to
be
reasonable.
now,
the...
the
other
argument...
two
other
arguments
that
defendant...
respondent
has
made,
and
that
is,
this
just
involves
the
relationship
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendant
and
it
doesn't
involve
his
attorney.
that's
not
true.
the
statute
deals
with
attorney's
fees.
it
doesn't
provide
that
the
defendant
shall
pay
plaintiff
monies
which
he
can
then
use
to
pay
his
attorney.
it
deals
with
a
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
it
also...
it's
clear
that
congress
intended
that
the
recovery
not
be
reduced
by
what
the
plaintiff
must
pay
his...
his
attorney.
and
that's
stated
in
blanchard
v.
bergeron.
i
might
add
that
if
we
assume
that
congress
is
rational
and
that
they
act
on
the
basis
of...
of
case
law
as
it
exists,
back
in
1948
and
the
fair
labor
standards
case
the
second
circuit,
the
judges
hand
and
jerome
frank
enunciated
a
proposition
which
was
then
picked
up
by
the
third
circuit.
i
think
they
said
it
better
than
i
can
say
it.
and
it
said,
it
seems
to
us
too
clear
for
argument
that
congress
did
not
intend
the
court
to
fix
a
fee
sufficient
to
compensate
the
plaintiff's
attorney
for
all
his
services
and
to
permit
him
to
collect
an
additional
fee
from
his
client
under
a
private
agreement.
such
an
agreement...
such
an
arrangement
would
require
the
cooperation
of
the
court
in
the
frustration
of
congressional
purposes.
moreover,
in
this
case
the
fee,
by
contract,
belongs
to
the
attorney.
he
said
so.
and
finally,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
attorney
is
to
be
a
co-venturer
in
this
project,
he
should
have
the
same
risks,
and
the
risk
is
what
does
the
judge
determine
as
his
reasonable
fee.
he
should
also
have
the
risk,
parenthetically,
of
having
to
undergo
the
obligation
which
the
plaintiff
has
of
paying
the
defendant
in
the
event
that
the
defendant
is
the
prevailing
party.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
well,
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
if
you
look
at
the
fee
between
the
plaintiff
and
his
attorney
and
the
fee
between...
and
the
reasonable
fee
between
plaintiff
and
defendant,
there's
no
rational
distinction
between
the
two.
they
are
both
contingent.
they
both
have
the
delay
factor.
they're
both
based
on
the
loadstar
or
the
amount
of
time,
and
basically
the--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--well,
except
that...
that's
true,
your
honor.
it's
not
based
on
time
except
for
the
fact
that
i
think
that
there
has
to
be
some...
all
courts,
since
the
days
of
blackstone,
have
regulated
attorney/client
contracts,
and
they
have
to
be
reasonable.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
i
missed...
that...
i
did
misspeak
on
that...
that--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--one
element.
but
as
far
as
the...
as
far
as
the
contingency
element,
which...
which
some
have
said
distinguishes
the
two,
there
is
still
a
contingency
factor
in
the
1988
fee,
and
there
is
a--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--well--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--well,
it's
the
whole
ball
game
either
way.
i
mean,
unless
he
wins,
he's...
he
doesn't
have
any--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--but
he's...
but...
yes,
your
honor,
but
he's
better
off
with
the
1988
between
plaintiff
and
defendant
because
if
it's
a
low
amount,
he
gets
his
time
anyway.
he
is
better
off
normal
tort--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--the
only...
the...
in
this
case
he
gets
a
windfall,
a
windfall
which--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--well,
as
far
as
the
contract
aspect...
and
the
respondent
has
said
that,
a
contract's
a
contract.
but
the
fact
is...
is
between
an
attorney
and
a
client
a
contract
is
not
a
normal
commercial
contract.
a
contract
is
between
a
fiduciary,
between
a
fiduciary.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
it's
a
highly
regulated
contract.
in
this
very
case,
as
i've
pointed
out
in
footnote
7,
the
case
itself
in
the
ninth
circuit
says,
a
contract
where
he
bargains
for
both
is
unenforceable.
and
as
i
said,
since
the
days
of
blackstone,
contracts
which
were
deemed
to
be
champertous
or
barratry,
or
whatever,
have
all
been
deemed
to
be
unenforceable
by
the
courts.
and
in--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--well,
except
for
the
fact
that
the...
the
contract
is
contrary
to
the
legislative
purpose.
it
basically
violates
that
which
congress
intended,
which
was
that
the
plaintiff
remain
whole.
for
example,
in
this
particular--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--yes,
and
by...
and
the
way
they
did
that
was
to
say
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
where
there
are
simply
injunctive
relief
or
declaratory
relief,
or
low
recoveries,
such
as
mr.
blanchard
in
blanchard
v.
bergeron,
the
attorney
will
get
his
full
recovery.
but
if
you
look
at
the
distinction
between
mr.
blanchard
and...
and
our
case,
mr.
blanchard
suffers
a
little
bit
of
damages
at
the
hands
of
a
sheriff,
and
as
a
result,
he...
after
paying
his
attorney,
he's
made
whole.
mr.
venegas
spends
two
and
a
half
years
wrongfully
in
prison
and
he
gets...
he'll
be
lucky
to
get
60
percent
of
what
he
gets.
in
other
words,
it's
the
same
thing
as
if
you
had
a
$1,000
hospital
bill.
the
$1,000
hospital
bill
is
fully
paid
after
paying
your
attorney.
if
it's
a
$100,000
hospital
bill,
you
only
keep
40...
60
percent
of
it.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
well,
he
hired
an
attorney
and
he
got
this
amount,
and
the
fact
is
that
the
other
attorney...
you
know,
when
we
talk
about
the
marketplace,
and
i
know
justice
o'connor
in
an
opinion
written
for
the
court...
actually,
her
own
opinion
in
the
pennsylvania
and
delaware,
referred
to
the
marketplace.
the
market...
marketplace,
with
all
due
respect,
is
a
fiction.
the
marketplace
is
based
upon
a
monopoly
of
attorneys.
and
contingent
fee
agreements
are
basically
standard
form
contracts
of
adhesion.
there
is
no
broker
out
there
that
directs
you
to
the
appropriate
lawyer
at
the
cheapest
fee.
there
is
no
real
competition.
forty--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--well,
they're
trying
to--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--to
get
clients.
but
the
fact
that--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--there's
a
lot
of
lawyers
out
there.
but
the
fact
is
that,
as
the
respondent
has
pointed
out,
you
look
at
all
the
cases
and
they
all
say
40
percent.
and
the
fact
is
that
in
this
case
what
is
so
egregious
is
it
was
40
percent
after
everything
had
been
completed.
and
the
trial...
you
know,
it
was
not
at
the
beginning
when
he
walks
in
the
door.
it's
40
percent
after
all
the
discovery,
after
all
law
and
motion,
after--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--they
don't
have
to
do
that,
your
honor.
what
they've...
what
they've
provided
and
what
they've
said
in
the
legislative
history
is
the
purpose
of
it
is
that
a
plaintiff
in
a...
in
a
civil
rights
act
is
a
private
attorney
general;
he's
enforcing
the
law.
as
senator
kennedy,
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
says,
"you
don't
make
a
policeman
pay
to
enforce
the
law.
"
we
view
mr.
venegas
as
a
private
attorney
general.
sure,
he's
trying
to
be
made
whole.
but
the
fact
is
it's
different
than
a
tort
case,
as
you've...
as
was
said
in
rivera...
riverside
v.
rivera.
and,
as
a
result,
the
whole
object
was
that
he
didn't
have
to
pay
for
it.
it
was
the
defendant
that
had
to
pay
for
it.
and
what
the
court
has
done
is
saying,
all
right,
we're
not
going
to
make
the
defendant
pay
anything
that
a
plaintiff's
attorney
asks
for.
we're
not
going
to
shift
whatever
he
says.
now,
there's
only
other...
one
other
way
of
making
sure
that
plaintiff
venegas
is
made
whole,
and
that
is
to
say
that
the
attorney
can
only
charge
a
reasonable
fee.
i
might
add
that--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--what
we've...
that's
a
possibility,
but
i
would
like
to--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--because...
well,
many
of
the
quotes
which
we've
said...
which
we've
laid
out
in
our
brief
and
which...
and
in
this
court.
this
court
itself
specifically
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute...
in
blanchard
v.
bergeron...
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
ensure
that
the
plaintiff
was
made
whole
and
did
not
have
to
disgorge
a
portion
of
his
earnings
to
his...
to
his
counsel.
and
that's
what
jerome
frank
and
the
third
circuit
said
with
the
fs...
f...
fair
labor
standard
act
legislation
and--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--yes.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
well,
presumably
it's
an
enforceable...
must,
it
seemed
to
me,
to
be
an
enforceable
contract.
in
other
words,
i
don't
know
that
a
contract--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--well,
i
think--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--i
think
respondent's
position
is
that...
that
venegas
must
pay
him.
i
mean,
that's
what...
that's
what
he's
asking.
and
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
whatever
he
must
pay
him,
it
shouldn't...
his...
his
amount
should
not
be
reduced
by
that
amount.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
we
don't
have--
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
it
seems
to
me...
it
seems
to
us
that...
that
that...
once
having
determined
that
that's
reasonable,
a
plaintiff's
attorney
should
not
be
able
to
ask
for
what
is
unreasonable.
now,
it's
true
there
are
other...
there's
a
whole
range.
i
mean,
for
example,
it
could
have
been
one-seventeen
or
one...
by
the
way,
the
extra
$15,000
went
to
a
prior
attorney
who
is
now
suing
for
six
times
that
amount
in
state
court.
so
that
the
attorneys,
unfortunately,
are
not
satisfied
with
whatever
the
judges
are
pronouncing.
and
what
happens
is...
is
that,
unless
this
court
sets
down
some
standard,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
going
to
have
more
of
this
collateral
litigation
between
unfortunate
civil
rights
plaintiffs
and
their
attorneys.
and
finally,
in
connection
with
what
the
court
did
below,
they
placed
the
burden
on
venegas,
which
is
wrong;
they
ignored
the
circumstances
at
the
time,
which
was
an
inadequate
disclosure
of
the
availability
of
section
1988;
they
ignored
the
disparity;
and
they
deemed
reasonable
a
contract
with
is
manifestly
unenforceable
under
state
and
federal
law.
so,
for
all
these
reasons
we
believe
that,
number
one,
the
court
should
adopt
the
rule
that
section
1988
precludes
the
attorney
from
receiving
more
than
the
court-awarded
fee,
and
if
it
doesn't
emanate
from
section
1988,
it
emanates
from
what
this
court...
or
at
least
the
dissent
said
in
the
mallard
case,
and
the...
and
the
majority
opinion
did
not
indicate
to
the
contrary...
that
the
court
has
an
inherent
power
to
regulate
the
attorney,
a
special
relationship
regardless
of
whatever
a
statute
says.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
no,
your
honor.
the
only
thing
that
they
sent
back
was
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
could
have
a
lien
basically.
in
other
words,
whether
or
not
there
was
an
intention
to
have
a
statutory
lien.
mr.
richard
m.
mosk
well,
that
is
probably...
could
be
litigated
in
state
court.
but
we
believe
that
the
court...
the
first
step
should
be
question
of
reasonableness,
and
that
is
for
the
court.
if
the
court
decides
that
it
is...
it
can't
decide
that,
or
it
doesn't
decide
that
it's
unreasonable,
then
mr.
venegas
has
all
of
his
other
options.
thank
you.
