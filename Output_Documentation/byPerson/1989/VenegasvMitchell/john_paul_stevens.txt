justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that's
not
quite
right.
the...
the
contingent
fee
agreement
with
the
client
is
not
based
on
time
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there's
just
no
relationship
whatsoever
in
this
case
between
the
time
and
the
amount
of
the
fee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you've
got
$2,000
or
$3,000
an
hour,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
it's
a
difference
between
being
in
a
factor
and
being
the
standard.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
if
contingency
is
one
factor
in
the
reasonable
fee
determination
by
the
court,
but
it's
the
whole
ball
game
in
this...
in
the
contract.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
has
to
win,
but
in...
in
determining
the
amount
of
the
fee,
contingency
is
the
entire
standard
under
the
contract.
it's
merely
one
of
the
factors
in
the...
in
the
course
determination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
some
cases
yes,
some
cases
no.
he's
not
better
off
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
gets
what
he
bargained
for.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
that's
true...
i
mean,
this...
if
this
contract
is
unenforceable
for
the
reasons
that
it's...
it's
really
excessive,
one...
one
could
say,
that
has...
that
would
be
true
whether
or
not
there
was
a
1988
out
there.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
an
argument
that's
really
independent
of
your
statutory
argument,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
it
also
intended
that
the
plaintiff
be
able
to
get
lawyers
who
might
not
otherwise
take
the
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
miller,
could
you
help
me
on
the
facts
here.
i
am
a
little
fuzzy
on
them.
did
the
amount
of
the
reasonable
fee
that
was
charged
against
the
defendant...
i
guess
$75,000
on
account
of
your
client's
services...
did
that
enhance
the
total
amount
against
which
the
40
percent
contingency
was
computed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
did
he
disclose
the
contingent
arrangement
at
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
mind...
just
so
i
understand
it...
i'm
really
kind
of
dense,
i
think.
would
you
go
through
the
arithmetic
of
how
the
fee
was
computed
in
this
case?
first,
tell
me
what
the
gross
amount
recovered
was
in
dollars.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
that
exclusive
of
the
attorney's
fees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
how
much
is
added
to
that
for
the
attorney's
fee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
all
done
or
just
a
share
that's
attributable
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
other
words,
he's
getting
40
percent
of
half
of
that
because
his
client
got--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--his
other
lawyer
got
another...
the
other
half.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree...
i
don't
know
whether
it's
open
in
this
case
or
not...
that
it
would
be
within
the
power
of
a
district
judge
to
look
at
these
facts
and
say,
i
think
this
fee
is
so
far
above
what
the
reasonable
fee
computed
was
that
i
will
hold
it
at
least
partially
unenforceable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--answer
to
justice
o'connor
suggests
that
the
damages
really
should
have
only
been
a
million
dollars.
here
we...
he
recovered
$2
million.
i
think
we
have
to
assume
that
was
the
correct
measure
of
his
injury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
that's
often
true.
that
in
a
bargain...
contingent
fee
cases
there's
not
exactly
precise
equality
of
bargaining
power
when
the
contract
is
made.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
you
argued
earlier
about
the
flsa
cases
that
say
you
can't
have
both
the
statutory
award
and
the
contractual
award.
but
here
your
contract
in
effect
gave
you
the...
the
statutory
award...
i
mean,
the
contractual
award
plus
40
percent
of
the
statutory
award.
so
you
did
get...
you
didn't
get
just
one.
you
got
one
and...
one
and
four-tenths.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
you've
never
sought
it,
but
that's
what
the
contract
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
but
i'm
just
suggesting
there
is
some
tension
between
the
contract
in
this
case
and
that
principle
that
you
could
get
one
or
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
to
a
slight
degree.
yeah.
