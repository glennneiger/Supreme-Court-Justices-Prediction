we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
88-1725,
juan
francisco
venegas
v.
michael
mitchell.
mr.
mosk,
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mosk,
does
the
central
district...
that's
where
this
case
was
tried,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
any
policy
of
regulating
contingent
fees?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
haven't
made
any
independent
claim
here
that
the
contingent
fee
should
have
been
reviewed
the
way
all
contingent
fees
would
be,
regardless
of
a
civil
rights
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
first
of
those
arguments
isn't...
isn't
raised
in
your
petition
for
certiorari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
hope
you
will
devote
some
of
your
time...
and,
of
course,
your
ability
to
do
that
depends
on
questions
from
the
bench
as
well
as
your
own
schedule,
i
realize...
to
the
question
of...
the
first
question
presented.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you're
saying
that
congress
virtually
forbad
contingent
fees
if
you're
saying
that
the
plaintiff
must
always
be
made
whole.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
where...
where
on
earth
do
you
find
that
in
the...
in
section
1988,
or
in
anything
that
congress
said
at
that
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
ninth
circuit
send
back
to
the
district
court
the
question
of
whether
this
fee
was
valid
under
california
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
didn't
leave
open
the
validity
of
the
fee
under
california
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mosk.
mr.
miller,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
miller,
supposing
that
we
had
the
kind
of
contingent
fee
contract
that
your
client
had
here
and
there
had
been
an
award
of
$20,000
damages
and
a
hundred...
and
the
court
says,
we'll
give
you
$100,000
attorney's
fees
under
section
1988.
now,
how
would
that
amount...
you're
getting
a
total
of
$120,000
from
the
defendant.
how
would
that
be
divided
between
the
attorney
and
the
client
under
this
contract?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
40
percent
of
$120,000?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
that
the...
the
attorney
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
keep
the
$100,000?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if
there
was
no
arrangement
for
attorney's
fees
at
all
and
you
have
the
same
recover...
recovery,
$20,000
damages,
$100,000
attorney's
fees,
then
the
attorney
gets
the
$100,000?
exactly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
with
no
understanding
whatever
between
a
private
plaintiff
and
a
private
lawyer,
an
award
of
$100,000
attorney's
fees
does
not
presumptively
or
automatically
go
to
the
lawyer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
would
think
so
when
they
call
it
attorney's
fees.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
that
would
be
true
in
a
federal
fair
labor
standards
act
attorney's
fee,
every
other
kind
of
statutory
attorney's
fee,
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
could
apply
the
statutory
fee
against
the
contingent
fee
if
it
were...
if
the
statutory
fee
were
smaller,
i
suppose?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
the
case
is
submitted.
