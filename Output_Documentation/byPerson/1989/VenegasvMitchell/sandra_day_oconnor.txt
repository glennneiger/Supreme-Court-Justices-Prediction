well,
mr.
mosk,
i
thought
you
argued,
with
reference
to
the
third
question
raised
in
your
petition,
that
a
federal
court
in
a
civil
rights
case
should
not
uphold
a
contingent
fee
agreement
which
is
unenforceable
under
state
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
i
thought
your
argument
was
to
the
effect
that
the
federal
court
had
to
look
to
state
law
for
enforceability.
your
responses
to
justice
white's
questions
indicate
quite
the
reverse
this
morning.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
40
percent
of
what?
40
percent
of--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
amount
including
the
attorney's
fees
that
were
awarded?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
who
do
you
think
is
entitled
to
the
statutory
attorney's
fee?
the
client
or
the
lawyer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wow.
well,
your
position
certainly
prevents
the
plaintiff
from
being
fully
compensated,
which
has
to
be
one
of
the
goals
of
the
civil
rights
act.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
what
end?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
what
end?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
compensate
a
plaintiff
who
has
been
injured.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
did
the
petitioner
argue
in
the
courts
below
that
the
contingent
fee
agreement
was
unenforceable
as
a
matter
of
state
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
should
the
court
in
reviewing...
suppose
we
think
the
statute
doesn't
set
a
cap
but
that
the
district
court
does
have
an
obligation
to
review
the
reasonableness
of
the
fee
agreement,
should
the
court
not
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
this
case
didn't
settle,
that
a
reasonable
fee
was
paid,
and
that
a
40
percent
contingency
above
that
on
these
circumstances
seems
unwarranted
because
it
reduces
the
recovery
of
the
plaintiff
to
such
an
extent?
now,
does
anything
prevent
the
district
court
from
considering
those
things
and
reducing
the
so-called
contingent
fee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
district
court
here
even
talk
about
anything
with
regard
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
fees,
or
did
the
district
court
just
say,
well,
that
was
the
agreement
the
plaintiff
signed?
