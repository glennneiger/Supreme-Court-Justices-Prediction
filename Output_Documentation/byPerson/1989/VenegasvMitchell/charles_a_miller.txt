mr.
charles
a.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
questions
from
the
court
indicate,
the
central
question
in
this
case
is
whether
congress,
in
passing
section
1988,
intended
to
restrict
or
limit
in
any
way
the
amount
that
an
attorney
could
charge
his
client
in
a
civil
rights
case
and
specifically
whether
congress
intended
that
the
reasonable
fee
awarded
to
the
prevailing
party
is
the
limit
on
what
an
attorney
can
charge
that
prevailing
party
pursuant
to
its
own
fee
agreement.
the
position
that
the
petitioner
argues
in
this
case
would
prevent
an
attorney
from
enforcing
any
type
of
contract...
a
contingency
fee
contract,
as
in
this
case,
a
fixed-fee
contract
and
a
contract
based
on
an
hourly
rate
basis...
any
kind
of
contract
that
would
yield
a
fee
higher
than
the
amount
set
by
the
court
under
section
1988.
did
congress
intend
that
result
by
this
statute?
i
think
the
answer
to
that
has
to
be
no.
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
statute
indicates
that
congress
intended
any
such
intention
or
that
it
even
addressed
the
question,
for
section
1988
does
not
address
the
question
of
what
a
prevailing
party
may
voluntarily
pay
to
his
lawyer
in
a
civil
rights
case.
section
1988
deals
with
what
a
losing
party
must
pay
by
order
of
the
court
to
the
prevailing
party
as
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
in
a
civil
rights
case,
not...
it
is
not
what
may...
what
parties
voluntarily
contract
before
a
case
is
decided
to
pay
for
legal
services.
rather,
it
is
how
much
a
losing
party
involuntarily
may
be
taxed
by
the
court
as
an
additional
recovery
to
the
prevailing
party,
in
this
case
the
plaintiff,
to
assist
in
covering
the
attorney's
fee
or
costs
of
the
case
to
the
prevailing
party.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
it
did
not,
your
honor.
i
would
like--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--i
would
like
to
clarify--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--three
things
about
that.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
first
of
all,
contrary
to
what
petitioner
says...
and
i
don't
know
why
he
says
it...
mr.
mitchell,
the
attorney
here,
did
ask
the
court
for
an
enhancement
of
his
fee.
he
set
forth
his
hours.
the
lodestar
figure
was
$37,000,
and
he
asked
the
court
for
a
multiplier
of
two.
and
the
court
gave
him
a
multiplier
of
two.
so
he
got
$75,000.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
he
did.
his...
his
fee
application
disclosed
that
he
had
taken
the
case
on
a
contingency.
it
stated
that
he
had
received
a
small
retainer.
he
did
not
indicate
the
percentage
in
this
contingency
agreement.
but
the...
the
lawyer
for
the
city
of
long
beach
indicated
in
his
response
that
typically
contingency
fee
contracts
of
this
kind
provided
for
a
contingency
of
25
to
40
percent.
he
happened
to
say
that
to
the
court.
the
court,
if...
he
thought
it
was
interested,
could
well
have
asked
mr.
mitchell
and
i'm
sure
he
would
have
told
them.
but
he
told
them
it
was
a
contingent
arrangement.
the...
the
contract
that
mr.
mitchell
had
with
his
client
specifically
stated
that
any
recovery
under
section
1988
that
mitchell
got
would
be
offset
the
amount
of
the
contingency
fee.
so
that
in
no
event,
under
this
agreement,
could
mr.
mitchell
receive
more
than
40
percent.
and
the
$10,000
retainer
was
also
credited
against
the
40
percent.
so,
that's
the
most
he
could
have
received
and
would
receive
if
this
contract
is
enforced.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
of
the
gross
amount
of
the--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--that
question
hasn't
been
litigated
in
this
case,
but
i
believe
mr.
mitchell's
understanding
would
be
yes,
it
would
be
40
percent
of
the
gross
amount
recovered
by
the
plaintiff
in
this
case.
he's
only--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--that
would
be
correct,
your
honor.
that's
right.
it
would
be
40
percent
of
the
gross
amount
recovered
by
the
plaintiff.
it
would
also
include,
had
it
not
been
waived
by
the--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
the
client
is
entitled
to
the
attorney's
fees
and
i
think
that's
what
this
court
held
in
evans
v.
jeff
d..
that
holding
has...
is
very
pertinent
to
this
case
because
it
makes
the...
the
need
for
an
enforceable
fee
contract
all
that
much
more
important
to
lawyers
who
are
going
to
represent
civil
rights
plaintiffs.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
don't
think
that.
i
don't
think
the
policy
of
the
statute
is
that
the
lawyer
wouldn't
share
in
the
attorney's
fee
payment.
i
think
the
understanding
of
the
statute
and
the
contemplation
is
that
in
the
normal
case
the
attorney
will
get
the
attorney's
fee
awarded
by
the
court,
depending
on
what
his
agreement
is
with
the...
his
client.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
answer
that
in
two
parts.
first
of
all,
the
goal
of
the
civil
rights
act,
as
stated
by
this
court
in
the
blanchard
case,
was
to
make...
section
1988...
was
to
make
sure
that
competent
counsel
are
available
to
handle
civil
rights
plaintiffs'
cases.
and
that's
been
said
by
this
court
repeatedly.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
pardon
me?
mr.
charles
a.
miller
to
the
end
that
these
clients--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--correct.
and
to
allow
these
people,
most
of
whom,
according
to
legislative
history,
have
cases
that
are
not
high-money
cases,
to
obtain
the
kind
of
counsel
that
plaintiffs
in
other
situations
are
able
to
get.
it
was
an
effort
to
equate
the
civil
rights
plaintiffs
and
to
give
then
the
wherewithal
to
pursue
their
cases
in
court,
even
though
those
cases
didn't...
normally
didn't
have
large
monetary
prospects.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i...
i
believe
under
this
contract
that
the
attorney
would
have
been
entitled
to
40
percent.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
yeah...
48...
four
times...
$48,000
in
that
case.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
he
would
not
be
entitled
to
the
entire
amount
of
the
attorney's
fees--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
now,
i...
and
i'm
saying...
i'm
catching
myself
here
because
i
can
imagine
the
next
question.
you
could
have
a
contract,
i
suppose,
in
which
an
attorney
provided
that
i'll
get
40
percent
or
the
court-awarded
fee,
whichever
is
greater.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
could
imagine
such
a
contract.
and
then
the
answer
to
your
question,
under
the
contract
would
be
different.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
i...
i
don't
think
that's
clear
at
all,
your
honor.
to
me
this
court's
holding
in
the
blanchard
case,
together
with
the
holding
in
the
jeff
d.
case,
indicates
that
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
goes
to
the
client,
it's
his
entitlement
under
the
statute.
now,
it's
normally
anticipated
that
that
award
is
for
the
purpose
of
compensating
an
attorney.
but,
if,
for
example,
the
attorney
has
a
fee
contract
with
his
client
that
would
yield
him
less
than
the
amount
established
by
the
court,
i
don't
think
it
follows
that
the
attorney
is
entitled
to
that
amount.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
to--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--absolutely
if
the
contract
doesn't
provide
for
it.
and
i
don't
know
why
it
should.
and
this
court
has
made
very
clear--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--not
necessarily.
i
don't
think
the
court
said
that
and
i
don't
think--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--it
necessarily
follows
in
there--
--but,
gee,
it
was
the
lawyer
that
was
suing
in
the
case
as
i--
--no.
you've...
you've
held
that
the
court
may
award
attorney's
fees
to
the
prevailing
plaintiff
in
the
situation
where
there
is
no
obligation
by
the
prevailing
party
to
pay
anything
to
his
lawyer.
that's
the
blum
case,
where
the
public
interest
firm
brought
the
case.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
now...
i
mean,
you
say
presumptively.
i
think
that
most
courts
presume
or
anticipate
that
the
amount
will
be
paid
to
a
lawyer.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
the
statute
uses
the
word
attorney's
fees,
but
it
says--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--judge
kelleher
spoke
to
this
in
fact
in
his
own
opinion
in
this
case
and
said
how...
this
is
a
vexing
issue.
he
was
about
to
attend
a
seminar
at
that
time
being
given
by
some
second
circuit
judges
to
discuss
this
issue:
what
happens
to
attorney's
fees
when
they're
awarded;
do
they
go
to
the
lawyers?
but
i
think
that
the
position
that
we've
advocated
here
is,
and
consistent
with
this
court's
holdings,
is
that
the
statute
provides
attorney's
fees
to
the
plaintiff.
if
the
plaintiff
has
a
fee
arrangement
with
his
lawyer
under
which
the
lawyer
will
be
compensated
in
some
different
manner
than
provided
for
through
the
award
from
the
court...
higher
or
lower...
that's
what
the
attorney
gets.
and
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
unreasonable
or
unfair
to
either
party.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
he
did,
your
honor.
he
presented
a
state
law
ground
for
not
enforcing
this
agreement
and
it
was
dealt
with
in
judge
kelleher's
opinion,
and
judge
kelleher
considered
it
and
rejected
it.
and
it's
in
his
opinion
that's
in
the...
attached
as
the
appendix
to
the
cert.
petition.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
that...
your
honor,
in
fact,
it
was
those
questions
that
were
left
open.
the
questions
as
to
whether
the
attorney
in
this
case,
mr.
mitchell,
was
entitled
to
a
lien
for
his
claim.
that
issue
has
since
become
moot,
and
it's
become
moot
because
subsequent
to
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
merits
of
the
case
the
plaintiff,
mr.
venegas,
entered
into
a
settlement
agreement
and
that
settlement
agreement
established
an
escrow
account
for
the
amount
of
fee
in
dispute
here
and
it
sits
in
escrow
awaiting
the
final
judgment
as
to
who's
entitled
to
the
attorney's
fees.
so,
it
made
the
issue
of
lien
moot,
and
all
parties
have
agreed
to
that.
so
those...
there
will
be
no
need
to
remand
those
issues
to
the
state
court
for
consideration.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
don't
think
the
settlement
agreement
spoke
to
that,
your
honor.
but
we
have
serious
doubts
as
to
whether
there
are
any
state
law
issues
that
can
appropriately
be
raised
at
this
point
if
this
court
affirms
the
decision
below.
in
the
district
court
the
plaintiff,
mr.
venegas,
represented
by
mr.
bromberg
as
his
counsel...
and
i
should
say
how
he
got
to
mr.
bromberg
by
the
way.
he
got
to
mr.
bromberg
because
mr.
mitchell,
when
he
proposed
to
take
the
appeal,
said
to
his
client,
"you
should
seek
independent
counsel
on
my
proposal
for
handling
your
appeal.
"
mr.
venegas
did
so.
he
consulted
mr.
bromberg.
they
concluded
that
they
should
not
accept
mr.
mitchell's
proposal
for
handling
the
appeal
and
instead
mr.
bromberg
agreed
to
handle
it
himself.
and
he,
thereafter,
represented
mr.
venegas
and
he
represented
mr.
venegas
in
the
trial
court
on
the
question
of
the
enforceability
of
the
contingent
fee
contract.
and
he
made...
advanced
a
number
of
arguments
why
it
shouldn't
be
enforced.
it's
unreasonable,
it's
excessive,
it
violates
state
law.
they
were
all
considered
by
judge
kelleher
pursuant
to
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
a
case
called
hamner
v.
rios.
and
that
court
sets
forth
a
rather
broad
standard
for
lower
courts
to
follow
in
assessing
the
reasonableness
of
attorney's
private
fee
arrangements
in
civil
rights
cases.
and
judge
kelleher
cited
that
case,
referred
to
the
standards,
indicated
that
he
had
a
broad
discretion
to
apply,
then
considered
the
arguments
that
had
been
advanced
by
the...
mr.
venegas,
including
the
claim
that
it
was
a
windfall.
and
judge
kelleher,
who
had
seen
the
trial...
he
saw
the
job
that
the
attorney,
mr.
mitchell,
had
done
and
knew
the
facts
of
the
case...
concluded
that
this
was
a
reasonable
agreement
and
ought
to
be
enforced.
and
the
ninth
circuit
sustained
that.
so
we
don't
see
that
there's
anything
left
to
be
decided
on
the
issue
of
the
enforceability
of
the
contract
if
this
court
affirms
the
decision
below.
if
that
occurs,
mr.
mitchell
is
entitled
to
the
sum
that
his
contract
provides
him.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
think
it
was
$2,080,000,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
that
was
exclusive
of
the
attorney's
fees.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
the
attorney
fee
award
was
$117,000.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
that's
the
total
amount
awarded.
and
i
will
say
to
you,
your
honor,
at
this
point
that,
although
i
answered
your
questions
to
the
best
of
my
ability,
mr.
mitchell
has
not
in
fact
claimed
more
than
40
percent
of
$2,080,000.
but
i
answered
your
questions
as
to
his
entitlement
of
the
contract.
but
he's
only
claimed
at
this
point,
and
only
will
claim,
40
percent
of
$2,080,000
for
himself
and
his
colleague,
mr.
cochran.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
yes--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--that's
right.
mr.
mitchell
would
receive...
i
can't
do
this...
it's
slightly
over
$400,000,
minus
the
retainer
he's
already
received.
then
the
balance
is
what
he
would...
he's
entitled
to
under
this
contract.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
he
had
that
power
and
i
think
that
power
was
invoked
and
judge
kelleher
thought
about
that
issue
and
decided
that
it
shouldn't
be
reduced.
but
he
did
have
the
power
to
do
it.
i
think
that
is
more
or
less
inherent
in
the
power
of
a
federal
court
and
any...
i
agree
with
mr.
mosk
on
that
point.
that's
an
inherent
power
of
a
court
in
a
supervisory
role
over
attorneys.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--i
think,
your
honor,
that's
a
tricky
question.
i
think
the
answer
is
basically
it
should
be
the
enforcement
of
state
law.
he
should
apply
the
state
ethical
standards
applicable,
in
this
case,
in
california.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
agreed.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
the
only
qualification
i'll
make
to
this
is
that
in
the
ninth
circuit
decision
hamner
v.
rios
which
told
the
district
courts
to
make
this
broad
inquiry,
one
of
the
factors
to
be
taken
into
account
was
whether
enforcement
of
the
lawyer's
contract
would
be
consistent
with
the
policies
of
the
federal
civil
rights
laws.
that
strikes
me
as
a
kind
of
a
federal
question
over
and
above
the
normal
state
law
ethical
questions.
perhaps
it's
embodied
in
california
state
law,
but
i
say
it's...
that's
why
it's
a
tricky
question.
to
that
extent,
in
a
civil
rights
case
the
determination
by
the
district
judge
may
be
more
than
a
purely
state
law
ethics
question.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
as
i
said,
i
think
you
would
read
the
state
law
as
to
embrace
such
a
concept--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--in
the
appropriate
case.
and
if
so,
then
i
think
you
can
say
in
all
aspects
he
is
applying
the
same
approach
that
would
be
applied
by
a
superior
court
judge
in
a
state
law
proceeding.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
absolutely.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
may
i
say,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
that
issue,
because
the
issue
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
cases
was
raised
for
the
first
time
in
the
reply
brief,
and
i
hadn't
had
occasion
to
consider
those
before.
we
did
some
research
on
those
because
it
didn't
sound
right,
what
i
saw
in
the
brief.
and
sure
enough,
what
we
found
is...
and
i
won't
belabor
this...
that
those
cases
themselves,
and
the
later
cases
that
have
discussed
them,
stand
for
the
proposition
which
we
advance.
and
that
is
that
it's
inappropriate
in
a
case...
in
that
instance,
the
fair
labor
standards
situation...
for
an
attorney
to
recover
both
the
statutory
fee
and
his
contingent
fee
under
his
contract
and
that
an
attorney
should
be
satisfied
with
a
single
fee.
and
i'll
just
cite
to
the
court
the
two
cases
that
the
court
may
wish
to
review
on
this
issue.
houser
v.
matson,
447
f.
2nd
860,
and
hayden
v.
bowen,
a
fifth
circuit
case,
404
f.
2nd
682,
and
cert.
was
denied
in
that
case.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
think
what
these
cases
stand
for
is
that
an
attorney
must
apply
the
statutory
fee
against
his
contractual
arrangement.
that
is
what
mr.
mitchell's
contract
provides,
by
the
way.
i
think
mr.
mitchell
felt
that
california
ethics
law
would
require
that.
most
of
the
appellate
court
cases
that
have
dealt
with
this
subject
have
said
this,
that
ought
to
be
the
rule.
the
lawyer
can't
get
both.
and
we're
not
seeking
both
in
this
case,
and
don't
advocate
that
anyone
is
entitled
to
both.
but
we
are
advocating
that
the
lawyer
is
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
his
contract
if
he
carries
out
his
bargain
and
wins
the
case
and
secures
the
result
sought
by
the
plaintiff
when
he
entered
into
a--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--i'm
not...
i...
i'm
not
sure
how
to
answer
the
question,
your
honor,
because
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
the
gist
of
it.
the...
the--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--i
think
that's
right.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
correct,
your
honor.
and
if
a
civil
rights
lawyer
felt
confident
and
knew
that
in
taking
one
of
these
cases...
not
necessarily
one
that
would
have
this
much
damages,
but
any
civil
rights
case...
that
he...
that
if
his
client
prevailed,
he
would
receive
a
statutory
fee
from
the
court,
that
he
would...
might
be
satisfied.
but
unfortunately
that's
not
the
situation
today.
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
evans
v.
jeff
d.
most
civil
rights
plaintiffs'
lawyers
in
most
cases
are
at
grave
risk
of
receiving
no
fee
whatsoever,
despite
their
efforts
on
the
clients'
behalf
and
successful
efforts.
and
that's
because
the
vast
majority
of
civil
rights
cases
settle,
as
the
vast
majority
of
all
cases
do.
and
cities
and
municipalities
who
are
usually
the
defendants,
have
caught
on
to
the
way...
the
fact
that
the
way
you
settle
these
cases
is
to
get
the
plaintiff
to
waive
attorney's
fees
under
the
statute,
particularly
a
case
that's
been
complex
and
long-standing
and
where
the
fees
promise
to
be
fairly
substantial.
so
an
attorney,
in
a
civil
rights
context,
is
at
great
risk
now,
as
mitch...
and
mr.
mitchell
has
been
the
victim
of
this
on
several
occasions,
as
our
brief
shows,
doing
a
lot
of
work,
achieving
the
essential
results
sought
by
the
plaintiff,
or
his
client,
and
then
having
a
settlement
made
in
which
a
condition
of
settlement
is
that
his
fee
is
waived.
of
course,
in
that
situation,
particularly
where
the
defendant
offers
the
client
essentially
the
relief
sought,
subject
only
to
fee-waiver,
an
ethical
lawyer
like
mr.
mitchell
is
in
a
tough
bind.
he
can't
tell
his
lawyer
not
to
accept
the
settlement
just
because
he's
not
being
paid
his
fee.
so
he
counsels
acceptance
of
a
settlement
that
achieves
the
law...
the
client's
basic
objectives
and
in
the
process
talks
himself
out
of
his
statutory
based
fee.
now,
unless
he's
got
some
protection
under
a
lawyer's
fee
contract,
he's
going
to
be
out
in
the
cold,
and
that's
why
civil
rights
plaintiffs'
lawyers
are
going
to
be
discouraged
from
taking
these
cases
unless
the
right
to
contract,
as
in
this
case,
is
sustained.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
i'd
like
to
answer
the
question
this
way,
justice
o'connor.
nothing
prevents
the
district
court
from
considering
that.
that's
an
appropriate
consideration.
in
this
case,
consideration
of
that
would
be
as
follows,
i
think,
because
fortunately
as...
unlike
other
cases,
we
have
sort
of
a
benchmark
here
as
to
what
the
client's
loss
was.
and
the
petitioner
himself
has
said
he
had
a
state
court
antecedent
proceeding
in
which
he
was
awarded
damages
of
a
million
dollars,
which
was
reversed
on
state
law
grounds.
and
says
the
petitioner,
this
case
was
easy.
he
already
knew
he
had
a
million
dollar
suit
here,
and
all
mr.
mitchell
had
to
do
was
try
it
and
collect
a
millon
dollars.
in
this
case...
it
wasn't
that
easy,
by
the
way,
for
reasons
i'll
come
to.
but
in
this
case
mr.
mitchell
secured
a
judgment
of
$2
million.
venegas
went
out
and
got
the
best
he
could
find,
and
it
produced
a
result
twice
what
the
so-called
benchmark
was.
so,
even
after
you
deduct
the
40
percent
mr.
mitchell
and
his
colleague
are
entitled
under...
to
under
their
contract,
the
client
here
has
been
made
more
than
whole
by
any
sort
of
generalized
benchmark
standard
one
can
look
at.
so,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
is
what
the
plaintiff
has
tendered
here,
certainly
it's
not
unreasonable
to
enforce
the
contract.
he
got
the
benefit
of
his
bargain.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
no.
the
district
court
addressed
the
issue
presented
to
them
as
to
whether
the
recovery
to
the
lawyers
would
constitute
a
windfall...
he
used
that
term
in
his
opinion...
and
he
said
it
would
not
be.
now,
he
didn't
write
a
12-page
opinion
on
the
subject,
but
he
saw
the
trial,
he
knew
the
background,
he's
an
experienced
judge.
and
he
concluded
that
it
was
a
fair...
he
knew
about
the
state
court
judgment,
i'm
sure,
before.
obviously
he
knew
about
that.
and
he--
mr.
charles
a.
miller
--not
a
windfall.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
what...
what
this
tells
you
is
that
in
cases
like
this
where
the
special
damages
were
very
small
and
the
entire...
virtually
the
entire
judgment
was
general
damages...
is
that
there
is
a
wide
range
of
what's
appropriate
recovery
in
cases
like
this.
and
how
much
a
plaintiff
is
going
to
recover
in
a
case
of
this
kind
is
highly
dependent
on
the
skill
of
his
lawyer.
in
this
case,
mr.
venegas
went
for
the
best.
he
got
the
best.
he
got
the...
he
got
the
result
that
one
hopes...
no
guarantee,
but
he
hopes
for
when
he
goes
for
the
best.
and
now
that
he
got
the
result
he
wanted
and
he
got
the
full
benefit
of
that
bargain,
he
wants
to
renege
on
it
as
far
as
paying
the
fellow
who
did
it
for
him.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
up
to
now
mr.
mitchell
has
never
sought
that.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
you
asked
about
that
and
i
tried
to
answer
it
fairly
as
to
what
how
i
thought
the
contract
could
be
interpreted.
the
contract
says
the
gross
amount
recovered.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
to
a...
to
that
slight
degree,
yes.
mr.
charles
a.
miller
the...
my
time
is
about
up,
but
i'd
just
like
to
come
back
to
the
basic
point
that
started
this
dispute
and
which
is
the
principal
issue
presented
in
the
cert.
petition.
and
that
is
did
congress
provide,
as
it
could
have,
that
there
should
be
limitations
on
the
enforceability
of
fee
contracts
when
they
exceed
the
amount
awarded
under
the
1988
provision?
congress
has
shown
its
ability
to
do
that
in
a
variety
of
situations
when
it
has
wanted
to
do
so.
but
i
would
like
to
leave
with
the
sort
of
the
fountainhead
case
in
this
area
that
started
all
of
this
to
begin
with,
the
alyeska
case,
which
is
the
case
that
led
the
congress
to
enact
section
1988.
and
there,
in
rejecting
the
notion
that
the
court
should
on
its
own
conclude
to
award
plaintiff's
attorney's
fees
in
successful
civil
rights
cases,
justice
white's
opinion
for
the
court
said
that
that
approach
would
make...
i'm
quoting
now...
would
make
major
inroads
on
a
policy
matter
that
congress
has
reserved
for
itself.
and
in
rejecting
the
rule
in
that
case
that
had
been
adopted
by
the
court
below,
this
court
said
that
the
law
concerning
attorney's
fees,
"is
deeply
rooted
in
our
history
and
in
congressional
policy.
"
"that
it
is
not
for
us
to
invade
the
legislature's
province
by
redistributing
litigation
costs
in
the
manner
suggested
by
respondents.
"
i
submit
to
the
court
that
that's
what's
being
asked
in
this
case.
that
the
petitioners
here
are
asking
this
court
to
invade
the
legislative
province
and
to
redistribute
litigation
costs
in
the
manner
in
this
case
quite
favorable
to
the
prevailing
plaintiff
who
has
secured
the
benefit
of
his
bargain.
this
plaintiff
actually
concedes
a
role
for
these
private
contracts.
in
his
brief
he
says,
well,
when
they
settle,
then
maybe...
and
part
of
the
settlement
is
waiver
of
the
attorney's
fees
under
section
1988...
then
perhaps
an
attorney
can
enforce
his
private
contract.
well,
if
you
can
enforce--
