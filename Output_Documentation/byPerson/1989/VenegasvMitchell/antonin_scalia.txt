do
we
know
that
that
was
his
standard
form
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
including
the
one
trial
limitation?
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
it...
it's
a--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it...
it
has
been
asserted
that
that's
unusual,
that
that
particular
feature
is
unusual
in
contingent
fee
contracts.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
is...
is
that
the
right
way
to
interpret?
i
wondered
the
same.
i
would
interpret
one
trial
to
mean,
you
know,
if
it's
a
hung
jury,
i
don't
do
a
second
trial.
but
if
i
win,
i'll...
you
know,
i'll
defend
the
verdict.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mosk,
is...
this
argument
you're
making
assume...
it
seems
to
me
it
assumes
that...
that
a
reasonable
attorney's
fee
is
one
single
number
and
that
there
couldn't
be
a
whole
bunch
of
reasonable
attorney's
fees
that
vary
enormously
in
amount.
so,
one
might
say
that
the
fee
awarded
by
the
court
here
was
a
reasonable
fee,
and
one
might
also
say
that
the...
that
the
40
percent
contract
agreement
provided
for
a
reasonable
fee.
i
mean,
there's
a
vast
range
of
reasonableness.
why
couldn't
congress
have
intended
that
it's
up
to
the
court,
the
court
will
pick
a
reasonable
fee
that
will
be
awarded
to...
to
counsel
so
that
plaintiff
doesn't
have
to
pay
it.
but
if...
if
plaintiff
has
contractually
obligated
himself
to
pay
more,
that's
something
congress
didn't...
didn't
address.
justice
antonin
scalia
these
lawyers
are
just...
that...
that
you
see
advertised
on
television
and
in
the
newspapers,
they're
just
throwing
their
money
away?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
which
suggests
that
there
is
a
market,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
true,
it's
true
for
everybody,
i
mean,
and
i...
and
i
suppose
we
shouldn't
allow
any
contingent
fees
and
should
award
all
reasonable
fees.
why
should
we
think
that
congress
believes
that
somehow
1988
plaintiffs
are
some
particularly
dull-witted
class
that
they
alone
among
all
litigants
have
to
be
protected
from
hiring
what
they
think
is
a
better
lawyer
and
agreeing
to
give
him
more
than
the
statute
would
otherwise
provide?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it
also
shows
that
your
contract,
to
the
extent
that
it
seeks
to
shave
away
40
percent
of
that,
as
you've
just
said
it
does,
contravenes
the
policy
of
the
statute,
which
is
to
give
the
client
the
full
amount
of
reasonable
attorney's
fees.
and
you're
saying
he
won't
get
that;
he'll
lose
40
percent
of
it
through
my
fee
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
then...
but
then
our
whole...
we...
we
have
held
under...
under
this
statute
that
even
though
the...
the
attorney's
agreement
provides
for
less
than
what
the
court
determines
to
be
a
reasonable
fee,
a
reasonable
fee
will
still
be
awarded...
more
than
what
the
contract
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying
that...
that
what
happens
to
that
excess
over
the
contract
amount
does
not
go
to
the
lawyer?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
very
strange
holding
we
made
then.
i...
i
thought...
i
thought
when
we
said
that,
that
the
money
was
going
to
go
to
the
lawyer.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
out
of
good
will...
they
assume
out
of
good
will
it's
going
to
be
paid
over,
you
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if...
and
in...
in
exercising
it
that's
purely
a
federal
power?
does...
does
the
district
judge
have
to
say,
well,
a
state
court
would
allow
it,
and
therefore
i
must.
justice
antonin
scalia
or,
could
he
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
otherwise
you're
going
to
have
to
write
in
the
contract
whether
you're
proposing
to
sue
in
federal
court
or
state
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
state...
the
state
would
have
to
take
that
into
account
as
well.
