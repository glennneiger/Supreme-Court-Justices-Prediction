justice
scalia
in
what
respect
was
the
governing
language
here
different
from
the
language
of
the
executive
order,
the
flrc--
justice
scalia
--you
think
conditions
of
employment,
which
is
used
in
the
statute,
is
a
narrower
term
than
working
conditions?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
conditions
of
employment
is
less
likely
to
include
wages
than
working
conditions?
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
a...
a
condition
of
employment
might
well
be
what
you
get
paid
for
the
employment,
but
i
don't
think
that
what
you
get
paid
for
employment
would
normally
be
called
a
working
condition.
justice
scalia
were
the
teachers
here,
the
unions,
asserting
that...
that
they
were
entitled
to
wages
that
were
not
comparable?
i
mean,
comparable
wages
doesn't
seem
to
me
a
very
precise
term
and
then
there's...
there's
a
lot
of
room
for
bargaining
while
still
remaining
within
the...
the
playpen
of
comparability,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
scalia
are
they
admitted
not
to
be
comparable?
justice
scalia
all
right.
justice
scalia
still
in
all,
comparable
isn't
identical
and
you
might
say
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
more
in
light
of
greater
distance
to
travel
to
get
to
this
school
as
opposed
to
those
schools
or
some
other
things,
wouldn't
that
be
considered--
justice
scalia
--still
comparable?
justice
scalia
so
why
can't
you
bargain
over
it
under
this
statute?
justice
scalia
well,
congress
should
have
said
precisely
then,
you
know,
shall
not
comparable
to...
shall
be...
shall
be
those
prescribed
by.
it
didn't
say
that.
it
said
comparable
to.
justice
scalia
those
decisions
can
be
arbitrary
and
capricious,
as
far
as
we--
justice
scalia
more
than
de
minimis
in
other
words?
justice
scalia
is
it
your
understanding
that
when
they
asked
you
to...
to
show
that
no
benefits
would
come
from
it,
they
were
talking
about
non-economic
benefits?
justice
scalia
you
are
in
control
of
your
budget
so
long
as
you
have
high
employee
morale?
is
that
the...
is
that
the
theory
of
that?
justice
scalia
now,
cost/benefit
analysis
takes
account
of
intangibles.
justice
scalia
the
word
"budget"
does
not.
justice
scalia
you
need
fewer
teachers
and
therefore
wouldn't
have
to
spend
as
much.
justice
scalia
it's
conceivable.
justice
scalia
is
it...
is
it
only
the
intangibles
that
have
that
economic
effect
that
the
authority
is...
is
willing
to
take
into
account?
justice
scalia
but,
if
an
intangible
has
no
economic
effect,
then
it's
irrelevant.
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
how
so?
justice
scalia
how...
how
can
an
intangible
that
has
no
economic
effect
have
any
impact
on
whether
the
agency's
budget
is
going
to
be
affected
or
not?
justice
scalia
you
didn't
answer
my
question.
tell
me
how...
how
it
can
affect
whether
the
agency's
budget
is
going
to
have
to
go
up
or
not,
if
it
does
not
have
a
demonstrable
economic
impact.
justice
scalia
let
me...
let
me
ask
it
as
a
question.
can
it
possibly
have
any
effect
on
whether
the
budget
goes
up
or
down
if
it
has
no
economic
impact?
justice
scalia
the
benefit.
if
it's
a
benefit
that
has
no
economic
impact,
can
it
possibly
affect
whether
the
budget
goes
up
or
down?
justice
scalia
i
think
you
can
answer
the
question
yes
or
no.
you
think
it
can?
justice
scalia
i'm
just...
just
talking
about
the
intangibles.
can
an
intangible
affect
the
budget
if
it
has
no
economic
impact?
justice
scalia
i
think
so.
justice
scalia
but
the
authority
is
saying,
nonetheless,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
that
you
somehow
must
weight
those
non-economic
intangibles
and
offset
them
against
this
budget
provision
here.
justice
scalia
but
that...
but
that
executive
order
is
not
dealing
with
a
statute
that
uses
the
word
budget.
this
agency
is
said
to
have
to
be
in
control
of
its
budget.
not
in
control
of
the
general
good
done
by
the
agency,
but
in
control
of
its
budget
in
particular.
that's
talking
about
money.
justice
scalia
it's
a
case
for
another
day
if...
if
the
way
the
authority
is
defending
its...
its
position
on
this
budget
point
is
by
saying
the
agency
has
to
take
into
account
non-economic
factors.
i
think
that's
a
question
for
today.
that's...
that's
the
theory
the
authority
is
using,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
scalia
but
i
don't
understand
what
you
just
said,
that
cost
alone
cannot
require
it
to
go
to
the
budget
process
and
ask
for
more
money.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
cost
alone,
it
has
to...
it
has
to
spend
another
million
dollars
for
teachers'
salaries--
justice
scalia
--and
you're
telling
me
that
alone
will
not
require
it
go
to
the
budget
process
unless
there
is
an
offsetting
economic
benefit.
justice
scalia
they
are
all
economic
benefits.
those
are
all--
justice
scalia
--economic
benefits.
justice
scalia
more
than...
more
than
not
ruled
out.
you've
required
the
employer
to
show
that
no
offsetting
benefits,
including
non-economic
benefits,
justify
the
act.
justice
scalia
mr.
persina,
could
you
satisfy
my
curiosity
as
to
who
the
impasse
panel
is.
who
appoints
them?
justice
scalia
the
president
does.
justice
scalia
is
it
a
full-time
job?
it's--
justice
scalia
--it
is
not.
justice
scalia
mr.
persina,
as
i
understand
it,
the
authority
puts
the
burden
on
the
federal
employer
to--
justice
scalia
--to
negate
any
benefits.
is
that...
is
that--
justice
scalia
--not...
not
for
the
union
to
show
that
there
will
be
benefits
that
will
compensate
against
the
increase...
taxing
on
the
budget,
but
for
the
employer
to
prove
that
there
aren't.
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
i
would...
i
would
stop
hectoring
you
on
this
if...
if
you
would
say
that
when
the
agency
says
the
employer
must
show
the
benefits
do
not
offset
cost,
the
agency
means
economic
benefits
do
not
outset
the
cost.
but
you...
you
cannot
say
that,
can
you?
justice
scalia
humphries
executor
v.
united
states
is
the
answer,
right?
justice
scalia
humphries
executor
v.
united
states.
justice
scalia
but
some--
