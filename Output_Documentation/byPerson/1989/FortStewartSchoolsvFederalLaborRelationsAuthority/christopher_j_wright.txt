mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
army
operates
schools
for
the
dependents
of
personnel
stationed
at
fort
stewart,
georgia.
this
case
arose
when
the
union
that
represents
the
teachers
at
those
schools
made
a
number
of
proposals
relating
to
wages
and
fringe
benefits,
including
a
proposal
to
increase
wages
across
the
board
by
13.5
percent.
the
army
refused
to
negotiate,
relying
on
various
provisions
of
the
federal
labor
management
relations
statute
and
on
a
statute
and
a
regulation
specifically
directed
to
the
dependents'
schools.
the
flra
held
that
the
proposals
are
negotiable
in
a
divided
opinion,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
we
believe
that
the
army's
refusal
to
bargain
is
justified
for
three
reasons.
first,
congress
did
not
make
wages
negotiable
in
the
federal
sector.
second,
it
instead
gave
agency
management
control
of
agency
budgets.
and
third,
the
salaries
of
teachers
at
the
dependents'
schools
are
to
be
set
by
comparison
with
the
salaries
of
teachers
at
the
local
public
schools.
before
i
discuss
those
three
reasons,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
it
is
undisputed
that
the
vast
majority
of
federal
employees
may
not
bargain
about
pay.
the
pay
of
most
federal
employees
is
set
by
the
general
schedule
and
such
employees,
about
a
million
and
a
half
in
all,
are
paid
what
congress
says
in
the
general
schedule
they
are
paid.
the
flra
has
changed
its
position
with
respect
to
another
large
group
of
employees--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--it...
it
works
that
way.
we...
we...
it
is
undisputed
we
think
for
three
reasons.
a...
there
is
nothing
in
the
act
that
says
general
schedule
employees
cannot
bargain
about
wages
in
so
many
words.
however,
the
portion
of
the
act
that
makes...
that
mandates
bargaining,
says
that
bargaining
is
not
permitted
where
a
matter
is
specifically
provided
by
federal
statute.
that
is
section
7109(a)(14)(c).
in
addition,
section
7117
provides
that
a
proposal
cannot
be
in
conflict
with
a
federal
law,
and
a...
and
a
proposal
to
pay
someone
differently
than
what
congress
has
set
in
the
federal
schedule
would
be
contrary
to
law.
both
the
union
and
the
flra
would
agree
with
that
i
believe.
they
would
not
agree
with
our
third
point
that
the
management
rights
provision
which
gives
management
control
of
the
agency
budget
also
means
that...
that
the
pay
of
general
schedule
employees
can't
be
set
by
statute.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
correct.
we...
we
think
that
they
are
in
many
ways
similar
to
prevailing
rate
employees.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
was
similar
in
some
ways.
the
language
was
not
identical.
it
did
provide...
it
provided
for
bargaining
over
working
conditions.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the
flrc,
the
flra's
predecessor,
did
hold
in
two
cases
that
pay
was
negotiable.
and
you've
gone
to
the
strongest
point
in
their
case,
so
let
me...
let
me
address
it
right
now.
as
the
d.c.
circuit
stated
in
its
excellent
opinion
in
the
overseas
schools
case,
we
believe
that
the
practice
under
the
flrc
and
the
executive
order
regime
has
been
superseded
by
the
flra,
for
the
reasons
the
d.c.
circuit
gave
and
the
reasons
i
will
give
in
the
bulk
of
my
argument.
namely,
that
the
language
congress
used,
the
statements
it
made
in
the
legislative
history,
and
its
reservation
to
management
of
control
of
the
budget
confirm
that
congress
did
not
want
bargaining
over
wages
under
the
federal
service
labor
management
relations
statute.
i'd
like
to
make
two
other
points
with
respect
to
the
flrc
decisions.
first,
whether
wages
were
working
conditions
was
not
raised
in
either
of
those
cases.
the
flrc
never
specifically
decided
that
issue.
second,
it's
clear
that
congress
was
not
aware
of
those
two
decisions.
in
fact,
senator
sasser
told
the
senate
that,
under
the
flrc...
the
flrc
had
held
that
under
the
executive
order
regime
that
wages
are
not
negotiable.
now,
normally
congress
does
intend
to
carry
forward
prior
practice.
but
we
think
that
it
intends
to
carry
forward
the
prior
practice
as
it
understands
it.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
don't...
i
don't
know
any
example
of
a
case
quite
like
this
one
where
a
senator
specifically
said
that
pay
is
not
negotiable
under
the
flrc
cases.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it's
possible.
our
primary
answer
would
be,
as
the
d.c.
circuit
stated,
that
we
think
for
the
majority
of
the
reasons
i
will
try
to
give
that
congress
didn't
want
wages
to
be
negotiable
under
the...
under
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--it
did
not
specifically
refer
to
conditions
of
employment.
the
act
now
says
that
conditions
of
employment
are
negotiable.
it...
it
defines
it
to
include
personnel
policies,
practices
and
matters
affecting
working
conditions.
but...
but
it...
but
the
executive
order
simply
referred
to
working
conditions.
now,
conditions
of
employment,
we
think
are...
are
important
because
in
the...
in
the
nlra
congress
made
wages,
hours
and
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
negotiable.
it
specifically
said
wages
are
negotiable.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
we
think
the
different
term--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
they
are
obviously
very
similar.
my
point
in
mentioning
it--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
in
this
case,
of
course,
it's...
conditions
of
employment
are
defined
to
include
matters
affecting
working
conditions.
so
congress
has
used
somewhat
a
different
language
here.
what
we
think
is
most
important
is
looking
at
both
the
nlra
and
the
postal
reorganization
act.
the
two
times
congress
has
made
wages
negotiable,
it
has
said
so
specifically.
the
postal
reorganization
act
to
our
mind
is
actually
the
most
analogous
statute
because
it
also
affects
federal
employees
and
because
the
committees
here
that
drafted
the
bill...
the
house
committee
was
the
committee
on
the
postal
service
and
the
civil
service.
in
the
postal
reorganization
act
in
1971
congress
made
wages,
hours
and
conditions
of
employment...
i'm
sorry...
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions
negotiable.
it
specifically
said,
as
it
said
in
the...
in
the
nlra,
that
wages
are
negotiable.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
we
agree,
as
we
tried
to
explain
in
our
reply
brief,
that
basically
our
position
would
be
in
accord
with
justice
stewart's
statements
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
the
fibreboard
case.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
as
justice
stewart
explained,
and
as
the
d.c.
circuit
explained,
the...
the
first
impression
you
would
get
from
that
language
is
that
congress
was
talking
about
the
physical
conditions
of
work.
safety--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that's
true.
we
think
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
because
we
think
that
after
this
court
uses
the
traditional
tools
of
statutory
construction,
as
this
court
said
was
appropriate
in
the
chevron
case
involving
deference,
that
the
court
will
be
left
with
the
impression,
like
four
courts
of
appeals,
that
the
statute...
clearly
that
congress
in
the
statute
clearly
did
not
mean
to
wait...
to
make
wages
negotiable.
as
i
have
said--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes.
once
one
looks
at
what
congress
has
done
in
other
statutes,
what
the
congressmen
said
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
what
congress
did
in
the
budget
right
in
the
statute--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
your
honor,
i
am
sorry
to
hear
that.
[laughter]
but
as
i
say,
the
majority
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
agreed
with
our
position,
even
though
they've
recognized
that
the
flra
is
entitled
to
deference.
i
might
add
that
the
flra
is
entitled
to
deference
with
respect
to
its
interpretation
of
the
federal
labor
management
law.
it
is
not
entitled
to
deference
with
respect
to
its
interpretation
of
the
dependents'
school
statute.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
would
be
a
better
case
for
us
were
that
the
case.
but
those
are
the
three
situations
were
congress
has
made
matters
bargainable.
the
two
times
it
has
made
wages
bargainable,
it
has
said
wages.
the
postal
reorganization
act
was
very
much
on
congress'
mind
in...
in
enacting
this
statute.
congressman
udall,
who
authored
the
compromise
that
was
enacted,
specifically
contrasted
the
practice
under
the
postal
reorganization
act
to
what...
the
practice
under
his
bill.
and
he
assured
his
colleagues
that
pay
would
not
be
negotiable
under
this
statute,
saying
that
the
bargainability
of
wages
for
the
postal
employees
had
been
very
troublesome.
in
addition,
two
proposals
were
made
to
congress
to
make
wages
negotiable.
congressman
ford
proposed
a
bill
that
would
have
made
wages
generally
negotiable,
and
congressman
heftel
introduced
a
more
limited
proposal
that
would
have
made
pay
negotiable
so
far
as
consonant
with
the
law
and
regulation.
neither
of
these
proposals
were
enacted.
they
were
both
rejected,
and
we
think
that
that
is
significant.
another--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes.
yes.
that's...
we...
we
think
that
in
that
statute,
in
a
nutshell,
section
241
and
subsection
(a)
says
that
these
schools
are
to
be
comparable
to
schools
in
the
states
where
they
are
located.
subsection
(e)
says
that
the
per-pupil
costs
of
the
dependents'
schools
shall
not
exceed,
so
far
as
practicable,
the
per-pupil
costs
at
the
local
public
schools.
now,
the
army
has
interpreted
that
reasonably,
in
our
view,
to
mean
that
if
you
are
going
to
offer
comparable
education
at
a
comparable
per-pupil
cost,
you
have
to
pay
teachers
comparably.
teachers
are,
after
all,
the
most
important
component
in
many
educational--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes.
that
that's
our
third
argument
in
this
case.
it's
independent
ground
for
overturning
the
decisions
below.
we
think
it's--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
[laughter]
it's...
it's
our
narrowest
argument.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
in
fact,
the
proposals
do
not
purport
to
be
comparable.
they
are
not
comparable.
the--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--the...
i
don't
know
if
they
would
admit
that
they
are
not,
but--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--the
salary
schedules
at
these
schools
are
actually
set
quite
specifically.
there's
a
sheet
of
paper
and
across
the
top
there
are
four
categories:
bachelor's
degree,
master's
degree,
special
ed
degree,
and
doctorate.
then
down
the
other
side
there's
years
of
experience.
and
so,
if
you
have
a
special
ed
decree...
degree
and
11
years
of
experience,
you
find
out
that
you
get
a
certain
amount
of
money
and
that's...
that's
the
way
these
things
are
done.
so
they're--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
and...
and--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
it
seems
to
us
that
that
sort
of
throws
congress'
commands
out
the
window.
the...
the
couple
of
hundred
dollars
here
and
there
would
still
be
comparable.
simply
untying
the
wages
at
the
dependents'
schools
from
the
wages
at
the
local
schools--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--and
they
need
to
be
comparable.
we...
we
think
the
army
has...
in
fact,
per-pupil
costs
have
to
be
comparable
and...
and
congress
recognized
that
you
couldn't
have
identical
per-pupil
costs.
the
army
would
have
to
make
sure
that
it
had,
you
know,
so
many
teachers
with
doctorates
and
five
years
of
experience
if
all
costs
were
to
be--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--the
statute
says
that
the
education
has
to
be
comparable
and
that
the
per-public
costs
have
to
be
comparable.
it
is
the
regulation
that
says
that
salaries
schedules
have
to
be
comparable.
i'd
like
to
make
one
other
point
with
respect
to
our...
our
primary
contention,
our
contention
that
wages
are
not
negotiable.
this
statute
is
different
from
the
private
sector
in
that,
if
a
matter
is
negotiable,
the
federal
service
impasses
panel
can
impose
a
proposal
on
an
agency
over
its
objection.
so,
in
this
case,
if
the
flra
prevails,
the
salaries
of
dependents'
school's
teachers
could
ultimately
be
set
by
arbitrators
rather
than
by
the
agency.
we
think,
especially
in
that
circumstance,
if
congress
wanted
not
only
to
make
wages
negotiable
but
to
allow
a
system
where
they
might
ultimately
be
set
by...
outside
the
agency,
it
surely
would
have
said
so
in
the
statute.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it's
an
agency
within
the
flra,
and
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
flra
has
a
semi-permanent
panel
of
members
of
the
impasses
panel,
but
that
they
also...
that
the
impasses
panel
itself
relies
very
heavily
on
the
federal
mediation
service.
and
it
in
turn
sends
many
matters
to
arbitrators
under
the
federal
mediation
service.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
not
that
i
know
of.
the
flra
reviews
grievance
decisions
by
arbitrators,
but
i
do
not
understand
that
they
review
impasse
panel
decisions.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
they
certainly
can.
let
me
make
one
other
point
with
respect
to
our
argument
that
wages
aren't
conditions
of
employment,
and...
and
that
is
that
after
the
ford
and
heftel
proposals
were
rejected,
congressman
after
congressman
got
up
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
assured
their
colleagues
that
wages
weren't
negotiable.
and...
and
we
think
that
that
reinforces
our
conclusion.
in
addition,
on
our
second
argument
that
the
budget
right
gives
agencies
control
of
the
budget,
the
first
thing
i
would
like
to
say
with
respect
to
that
is
that
the...
the
budget
right,
which
says
that
nothing
in
the...
in
the
civil
service
reform
act
shall
affect
the
authority
of
agency
management
to
determine
the
budget
of
the
agency
reinforces
our
first
position.
we
think
that
it
would
be
contradictory
for
congress
to
state
simultaneously
that
management
has
control
of
the
budget
but
wages
are
on
the
bargaining
table.
since
wages
could
ultimately
be
set
by
arbitration--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--no,
it
is
not
our
position.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we...
we
would
certainly
allow
that
something
that
had
a
relatively
de
minimis
impact
on
the
budget
would...
would
not
be
negotiable.
the
flra
has
gone
to
the
other
extreme.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
if
it
would...
if
it
would
be
so
large
as
to
interfere
with
the
agency's
budget,
yes,
it
is
our
position
that
it
becomes
nonbargainable.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
it
would
be
for
the
flra
to
determine
ultimately
what
that
standard
might
be.
whether
it
would
be
more
than
de
minimis
or
would
have
to
substantial
has
simply
not
been
litigated
to
this
point.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
the
flra
has--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--placed
the
burden
on...
on
management--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--not
only
to
show
the
costs
of
the
proposal...
and
here
it
seems
to
us
a
cost
of
a
13.5
percent
pay
increase
seeks...
speaks
for
itself.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
which,
of
course,
we're
not
prepared...
we're
not
about
to
announce
before
a
negotiations--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--the...
the...
in
this
particular
school
year
the
agency
gave
the
teachers
a
6
percent
pay
raise
and
then
in
the
middle
of
the
year
gave
them...
i
think
it
was
a
6.8
percent
pay
raise...
and
then
in
the
middle
of
the
year
gave
them
another
4
percent.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
in
this
particular
year.
but
we
think
that
this
proposal
here
calls
in...
calls
into
question
the
entire
agency
budget,
the
largest
item
in
the
agency's
budget.
and
it
obviously,
therefore,
deprives
the
agency
of
control
over
its
budget.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
they
also
wanted
us
to
prove
that
the
benefits
that
flowed
from
the
union
proposal
wouldn't
outweigh
the
costs.
in
other
words,
they
put
the
burden
on
management
of
proving
the
benefits
that
would
flow
from
the
union
proposal.
now,
we
don't
know
what
benefits
might
flow
from
this
proposal.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no.
certainly
not
in
every
case.
if...
if
it
were
totally
unclear,
if
it
weren't
something
like
a
13.5
percent
increase,
it
might
well
be
reasonable.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
i
believe
so
because
what
they...
near
as
we
can
tell,
they
seemed
to
think
that
an
across
the
board
pay
increase
would
improve
employee
morale
and
that
would
be
the
compensating
benefit
here
that
would
outweigh
the
costs
of
the
13.5
percent
proposal.
now,
i
suppose
employee
morale
improving
might
cut
down
on
turnover
and
ultimately
lead
to
some
monetary
saving.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i
think
that's
the
other
side's
position.
the
heart
of
the
problem
with
the
flra's
test
on
the
budget,
i'd
like
to
say,
is
made
clear
on
page
15
of
its
brief
where
it
says
cost
doesn't
matter.
more
specifically,
it
says
that
the
cost
of
a
proposal
alone
is
an
insufficient
basis
to
find
interference
with
the
statute's
budget
right.
in
the
nrc
case,
which
this
court...
which
is
pending
before
the
court
right
now,
a
20
percent
pay
raise
was
proposed,
which
would
cost
the
agency
$32
million
annually.
the
cost
of
that
proposal
alone
doesn't
rule
it
out
under
flra's
agency...
under
the
flra's
budget
test.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i'd
like
to
make
just
a
few
points.
first,
with
respect
to
the
first
issue
as
to
whether
wages
are
negotiable
conditions
of
employment,
i
believe
justice
white
pointed
out
that
it
appears
that
the
flra's
position
is
that
congress
deliberately
left
wages
out
of
the...
out
of
the
statute.
it
knew
that
97
percent
of
the
employees
couldn't
bargain
about
wages,
and
so
it
took
wages
out
of
the
statute.
we
think
that
rather
than...
that
this
court
would
have
to
engraft
wages
into
the
statute
to...
to
write
an
opinion
going
the
other
way.
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history
on
that
issue,
no
one
ever
said
on
the
floor
of
congress
that
employees,
like
these
teachers,
could
bargain
about
pay.
with
respect
to
the
other
statutes
that
have
been
mentioned,
not
one
of
those
makes
wages
negotiable
without
saying
wages
are
negotiable.
on
the
budget
point,
as
i
understand
the
discussion
that
went
on,
the
flra's
position
is
not
only
that
intangibles
might
outweigh
the
costs
but
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
of
course,
our
primary
argument
is
that
weighing
costs
and
benefits
is
the
heart
of
the
budget-making
process.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that
congress
has
reserved
the
budget-making
process--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we...
we
think
that
any...
any
proposal
that
calls
into
account
the
salaries
of
the
schools--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
our
position
is
that
salaries
are
just...
are
just
off
the
negotiating
table.
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
in
your
example,
justice
stevens,
we've
already...
the
army
has
already
lost
control
of
the
budget
process.
it's
taken
into
account
the
negotiability,
a
demand
that
would
be
made--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--it's
not
impossible.
our
position
is
that
opening
the
wages
of
teachers
at
schools
to
negotiation,
will...
will
deprive
the
management
of
control
of
the...
of
the
school's
budget.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
even
in
that
unlikely
event,
which
is
not
presented
here.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
