chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
no.
89-65,
fort
stewart
schools
v.
federal
labor
relations
authority.
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
wright,
with
respect
to
that
first
category
of
employees,
is
bargaining
over
their
wages
specifically
excluded
by
the
act,
by
the
flra?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how...
how
much
weight
would
we
ordinarily
give
to
the
action
of
congress
in
1935
says
wages
are
to
be
bargained
about
under
the
nlra?
congress
in
1971
says
they
are
to
be
bargained
about
in
the
postal
service
act.
then
congress
comes
along
seven
years
after
in
'78
and
says
conditions
of
employment.
it
seems
to
me
that
inference
is
not
as
strong,
or
as
if
you
are
talking
about
the
same
statute
where
congress
says
one
thing
in
one
section
and
uses
a
different
phrase
in
another
section.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
any
review
authorized
of
a
decision
of
the
impasse
panel?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
mr.
persina.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
it...
would
that
showing
have
to
discount
not
only
the
economic
benefit
of...
but
the
tangible
economic
benefit
for
the
agency
but
also
the
kind
of
intangible,
such
as
employee
morale
factor?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
persina,
what's
your
answer
to
the
solicitor
general's
contention
that
in
the
postal
service
reorganization
act
in
'71
the
statute
dealing
with
what
was
bargainable
specifically
said
wages;
the
nlra
specifically
said
wages.
this
statute
just
says
conditions
of
employment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
those
decisions...
is
it
like
baseball
free
agency
where
the
panel
has
to
pick
either
one
proposal
or
the
other,
or
can
it
come
up
with
a...
can
it
say...
can
it
say
either
your
proposal
is...
has
to
be
accepted
or
your
proposal
can
be
rejected?
or
can
it
have
some
sort
of
a
compromise?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
persina.
mr.
wright,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
the
case
is
submitted.
