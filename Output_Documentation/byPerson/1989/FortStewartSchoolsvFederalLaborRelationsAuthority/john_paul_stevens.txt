justice
stevens
well,
you
are
talking
about
regulations
not
the
statute
now,
aren't
you?
the
statute
just
says
that
the
education
has
to
comparable.
justice
stevens
how
is
the
federal
services
impasses
panel
appointed?
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
manner
of
its
appointment.
justice
stevens
--but,
mr.
wright,
it
is...
it
is
not
your
position,
is
it,
that
all
proposals
must
be
cost-free?
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
excuse
me.
is
it
your
position
that
any
proposal
over
a
matter
that
is
otherwise
bargainable,
becomes
nonbargainable
if
it
would
cost
a
lot
of
money?
justice
stevens
and
who
has
the
burden
on
the
issue
on
the
budget?
justice
stevens
says
you
do.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
well,
it
doesn't
really
because
what's
really
at
issue
is
the
difference
between
13.5
and
what
you
were
prepared
to
give
anyway.
justice
stevens
well,
there
is
something
in
the
papers
that
suggests
you...
you
did
indicate
a
willingness
to
give
something
like
10
or
11
percent,
didn't
you?
justice
stevens
so
the
difference
between
13.5
and
10.8
or
whatever
it
is,
is
really
what
is
the
impact
on
the
budget
that
would
otherwise
have
been--
justice
stevens
--well,
but
as
i
understood
the
flra,
they
took
the
position
that
you
had
the
burden
of
explaining
just
to
what
extent
it
impacted
on
the
budget.
and
if
was...
if
it
looked
substantial,
they
were
prepared
to
listen
to
you.
justice
stevens
well,
sometimes
you
might.
i
mean...
i
don't
know.
but
is
it...
but
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
in
every
case
it's
unreasonable
to
ask
management
to
explain
its
understanding
of
what
impact
this
would
have
on
the
budget?
justice
stevens
is
it...
is
it
correct
that
their
decisions
are
nonreviewable?
justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
there,
mr.
wright?
it's
true
that
is
what
they
have
argued
today,
but
i'm
not
sure
their
opinion
in
this
case
relies
on
the
possibility
of
intangible
benefits.
i
think
one
can
say
that
in
this
case
they
said
that
you
failed
in
two
respects.
one,
that
you
don't
show
tangible
benefits
and,
two,
that
you
didn't
even
show
the
impact
on
the
budget
itself.
justice
stevens
well,
that
may
be
but--
justice
stevens
--but
don't
you
have
to
respond
to
the
argument
that
at
least
you've
got
to
show
that
it
has
a
50
cent
impact
on
the
budget?
and
you
didn't
even
show
that.
and
we
don't
know
it
to
be
true
simply
because
its
13.5
percent
because
you
might
have
prepared
a
budget
that
considered
the
contingency
of
a
20
percent
increase.
we
don't
know
what
your
budget
was.
justice
stevens
but
what
if
you
had
previously
determined
in
your
own
budget
that
you'd
sent
to
the
commander-in-chief
of
the
army,
or
whoever
it
would
go
to,
that
you...
you
think
the
union
is
going
make
an
outrageous
demand
because
all
the
local
schools
have
gone
up
20
percent,
so
we'd
better
budget
for
20
percent,
even
though
we
may
not
have
to
pay
it?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
your...
and
your
budget
argument...
just
confining
it
to
the
budget
argument,
how
can
you
could
say
on
that
hypothetical
there
would
be
any
impact
on
the
budget?
justice
stevens
but
what
if...
no,
say
that
it's
not
negotiable.
suppose
they
just
decided
as
a
matter
of
policy
they
think
these
teachers
ought
to
be
increased
even
more
than
the
union
later
demanded,
and
they
budgeted
that
amount?
that's
not
impossible.
justice
stevens
even
if
they
ask
for
less
than
you
had
budgeted?
