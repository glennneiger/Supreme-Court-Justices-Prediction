mr.
william
e.
persina
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
authority's
holding
in
this
case,
affirmed
by
a
unanimous
court
of
appeals,
stands
on
three
eminently
reasonable
points.
first,
that
the
compensation
paid
to
a
federal
employee
for
work
performed
constitutes
an
aspect
of
that
employee's
work
relationship
with
his
or
her
employer.
indeed,
compensation
is
probably
the
primary
condition
upon
which
the
employment
relationship
is
initiated
and
maintained.
so
for
the
relative
handful
of
federal
employees,
such
as
those
in
this
case,
whose
compensation
is
not
established
in
statute,
compensation
is
a
mandatory
bargaining
subject
under
the
federal
sector
labor
law.
the
authorities
second
point
is
that
simply
because
a
bargaining
proposal
entails
an
initial
or
facial
cost,
that
is
not
enough
of
a
reason
in
itself
to
conclude
that
implementation
of
the
proposal
will
interfere
with
the
agency's
budget
right.
rather,
that
agency
employer
must
show
that
the
real
cost
impact
of
that
proposal,
after
its
compensating
benefits
are
taken
into
account,
will
require
the
agency
to
seek
more
money
through
the
budget
process
to
conduct
its
affairs
than
it
had
originally
determined
was
necessary.
and
that
is
a
showing
that
the
employer
agency
in
this
case
has
not
made.
mr.
william
e.
persina
well,
as
mr.
wright
indicated,
some
of
the
intangibles
will
very
frequently
be
able
to
be
converted
into
tangibles.
really,
the
analysis
is
little
more
than
the
familiar
cost/benefit
analysis
that
is
a
commonly
used
tool
both
inside
and
outside
the
government
for
management
planning.
mr.
william
e.
persina
yes,
it
does.
mr.
william
e.
persina
well,
but
the
point
here
is
whether
or
not
the
cost
impact
of
the
proposals
will
be
sufficient
to
offset.
now,
certainly
some
of
these
intangibles,
we
think,
for
instance...
and
morale
i
think
is
a
good
example.
if
employee
morale
is
good,
that
can
logically--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
that's
a
possibility.
mr.
william
e.
persina
there
would
be...
there
would
be
reduced
turnover.
mr.
william
e.
persina
well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
mix
of
intangibles
and...
and
best
estimates
as
to
how
those
intangibles
would
convert
into
monetary
figures.
but,
no,
even--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--no.
i
think
an
intangible
may
be
taken
into
account
by
the
authority
in
its
compensating
benefits
analysis.
mr.
william
e.
persina
i
don't
think
it
has
to--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
i
think
is
an
intangible
that
may
not
be
reducible
to
a
specific
dollar
and
cent
term.
but
there
can
be
some
general
basis,
such
as
morale,
and
think
that
is
a
good
example,
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
bad
morale.
for
instance,
if
this
employer
and
come
in
and
say--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
again,
i
think
that
it
would
be
largely
a
question
of
how
those
intangibles--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--if
the
proposal
does
or
the
benefit
does?
mr.
william
e.
persina
i
think
that
would
be
an
aspect
of
the
employer's
compensating
benefits
analysis--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--i
think
it
is
possible
that
taking
the
collection
of
tangibles
and
intangibles
together,
it
can
be
assessed
whether
this
proposal--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--that
would
be
very
difficult
to
say
that
it
did.
mr.
william
e.
persina
but
i
think
that
there--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
i
think
it
would
probably
be
very
much
like
the
cost/benefit
analysis
that's
called
for
in
executive
order
12221
which
places
on
regulatory
agencies
of
the
government
the
requirement
to
engage
in
cost/benefit
analysis
when
they
regulate
an
industry,
and
that
specifically
identifies--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
it
really
is
more
of
a
question
to
be
worked
out
as
agencies
make
the
showing
that
is
required
here.
and
habit...
i
think
it
is
a
case
for
another
day
to
see
how
it
is
the
authority
treats
those
issues.
what
we
have
here
is
the--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
test
is
reasonable
as
an
implementation
of
the
competing
interests
of
the
statute.
on
the
one
hand
it
does
recognize
the
employers'
allegations,
or
the
ability
of
an
employer
to
allege
that
the
real
cost
impact
of
the
proposal,
after
the
compensating
benefits
are
considered,
may
require
the
agency
to
seek
more
money
to
run
its
operations
than
it
had
originally
determine
was
necessary.
but
on
the
other
hand
it
recognizes
that
cost
alone,
or
a
cost
consequence
alone,
cannot
be
said
to
require
that
agency
to
go
to
the
budget
process
and...
and
seek
more
money.
it
really
requires
a
consideration
of
all
of
those
benefits
and
debits
of
the
proposal.
and
i
think
that's
a
reasonable--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
for
instance,
let's
take
the
proposals
in
this
case--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--but--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
no.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
that
because
what
i
am
saying
is
that
it's
not
known
whether
that
step
is
necessary
until
it
is
know
whether
a
pay
increase
will
reduce
the
turnover
problem
that
this
agency
has,
will
reduce
recruitment
costs,
will
reduce
new
employee
training,
things
like
that.
and
there
are
also
grievance--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
think--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--i
would
think...
well,
all
i'm
trying
to
get
across
here,
i
think,
is
that
i
think
primarily
the
economic
issues
are
going
to
be
the
primary
issues
in
compensating
benefits
analysis.
but
the
authority
has
not
ruled
out
the
showing
or
the
ability
of
an
agency
employer
to
show
intangibles
as
well.
but
i
think
that--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
i
think
what...
as
i
remember
in
the
wright-patterson
test,
the
types
of
compensating
benefits
in
volume
2
of
flra
deal
with
such
things
as
grievance
filing
rates,
productivity,
and
i
believe
morale
may
be
mentioned
as
one
of
the
compensating
benefits
factors.
but
i
think
the
state
of
the
law
right
now
is
the
authority
has
not
ruled
it
out.
it
would
take
that
showing,
if...
if
the
employer
suggested
it.
i
don't
think
the
offset
need
be
a
dollar
and
cent
exact
figure
as
far
as
requiring
the
agency
to
show
that.
an
agency
that
shows
that
there's
enough
of
a
chance,
that
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
money
that
will
be
needed
or
a
significant
amount
of
money
that
would
be
needed
to
be
obtained
in
addition
to
what
they
thought
they
need
to
run
the
schools,
i
would
think
would
win
their
compensating
benefits
analysis.
but
we
don't
even
have
an
employer
here
who
is
attempting
to
make
any
showing
on
that
issue.
and
i
think
what
we
really
have
here
is
the
reasonableness
of
the
test.
and
how
the
authority
treats
things
like
intangible
benefits
of
a
proposal
as
opposed
to
tangible,
i
think
really
remains
to
be
seen
over
time
when
some
agency
employers
start
trying
to
meet
the
test
on
its
terms
rather
than
attacking
it.
we
think
it's
a
reasonable
test
that's
entitled
to
a
chance,
and
no
agency
employer
has
done
that
yet.
so,
i
think
that's
where
the
state
of
the
law
is
on
the
issue
now.
mr.
william
e.
persina
well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
those
laws,
the
postal
reorganization
act
and
the
nlra,
congress
manifestly
wanted
to
make
pay
negotiable
for
all
employees
who
were
covered
under
that
law.
under
the
federal
sector
statute,
the
situation
is
very
different.
congress
manifestly
wanted
to
make
pay
non-negotiable
for
the
overwhelming
majority
of
federal
employees
but
had
no
concern
with
the
relatively
few
pockets
of
federal
employees
who
are
free
to
negotiate
their
wages
because
congress
has
not...
has
chosen
not
to
set
them
through
legislation.
really,
for
this
sort
of
reason,
we
think
it
highly
inappropriate
to
be
considering
these
other
laws
with
their
different
purposes,
their
different
policies,
their
different
employee
coverage
and
particularly
their
different
policies
as
to
the
negotiability
of--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
a
congress
that
was
looking
to
make
wages
non-negotiable
for
97
percent
of
the
federal
work
force
would
not
normally
include
wages
as
something
that
could
be
bargained
and
then
take
it
out
through
7103(a)(14)(c)
by
saying
that
matters
specifically
established
in
statute
are
nonnegotiable.
i
think
if
i
were
a
congress
that
wanted
to
make
pay
non-negotiable
for
97
percent
of
the
employees
to
be
covered
under
the
statute,
but
didn't
have
a
concern
with
the
few
small
groups
of
employees
who
could
negotiate
their
wages
because
the
congress
chooses
not
to
set
them,
i
would
write
the
law
in
just
the
way
that
the
statute
is
written
to
allow--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
it
does
not
include
wages
because
of
the
operation
of
the
statutory
exclusion
from
the
substantive
definition.
it
does
not
exclude
wages
because
of
the
substantive
definition
itself.
and
that
is
a
large
part
of
our
point
here.
yes,
indeed,
congress
did
seek
to
make
pay
nonnegotiable
for
the
great
majority
of
federal
employees,
but
it
did
it
in
7103(a)(14)(c),
not
in
the
substantive
definition.
the
term
personnel
policies,
practices
and
matters
affecting
working
conditions
clearly
fits
wages.
all
three
of
those
categories,
we
think,
eminently
cover
wages.
indeed,
we
think
a
claim
that
the
main
quid
for
working...
the
quo
for
working,
is
compensation.
and
we
think
that
is
plain
in
terms
of
just
looking
at
an
employee
who
is
dissatisfied
with
his
or
her
pay.
that
employee
will
seek
to
sever
that
employment
relationship.
so
pay
can
go
to
the
very
existence
of
the
employment
relationship
itself.
and,
indeed,
we
think
it's
a
major
failing
of
the
schools'
case
here,
that
they
have
offered
us
no
workable
theory
whatsoever
for
why
it
is
that
compensation
does
not
constitute
personnel
policies,
practices
and
matters
affecting
working
conditions.
but
the
strength
of
that
point,
that
compensation
is
a
condition
of
employment
in
this
case
for
these
employees,
is
supported
not
just
by
the
plain
language
of
the
definition
itself.
it
is
also
supported
by
the
executive
order
practice
that
took
place
prior
to
the
statute.
both
executive
orders
10988
and
11491
delineated
the
scope
of
bargain
subjects
by
saying
that
personnel
policies
and
practices
and
matters
affecting
working
conditions
were
within
the
scope
of
the
bargaining
obligation.
and
that
language
is
obviously
virtually
identical
in
all
significant
respects
to
the
definition
of
conditions
of
employment
here.
and
really,
contrary
to
my
brother
wright's
remarks
earlier
in
the
argument
that
the
executive
orders
did
not
reference
conditions
of
employment,
in
the
preambles
to
both
those
executive
orders,
congress
did
just
that.
it
said
that
employees
should
be
able
to
work...
to
negotiate
on
the
conditions
of
their
employment.
in
section
11(a)
of
the
executive
orders
it
then
said
that
personnel
policies
and
practices
and
matters
affecting
working
conditions
were
proper
bargaining
subjects.
so
we
think
it
plain
that
congress
was
looking
in
the
statute
to
carry
over
that
executive
order
practice.
and
i
would
also
indicate
that
in
the
federal
labor
relations
council's
merchant
marine
decision,
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
congress
did
explicitly
say
that
compensation...
or
the
council,
rather,
said
that
compensation
is
a
personnel
policy
and
practice
and
matter
affecting
working
conditions.
and
the
only
way
under
the
executive
orders
that
compensation
was
made
non-negotiable,
was
through
its
being
established
in
legislation
and
that
is
precisely
the
system
that
congress
carried
over
under
the
statute.
so
the
situation
in
federal
sector
labor
relations
at
the
time
that
congress
considered
the
statute
was
clear.
compensation
did
constitute
personnel
policies,
practices
and
matters
affecting
working
conditions
and
was
only
non-negotiable
if
it
was
established
through
legislation.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
which
shows
that
congress
wanted
to
change
that
situation.
in
fact,
there
are
a
number
of
indicators
that
congress
wanted
to
maintain
just
that
state
of
affairs
under
the
statute,
both
in
its
language...
in
its
choice
of
language
in
the
statute
and
the
debates
that
took
place.
as
to
the
language,
we've
already
seen.
congress
adopted
the
same
substantive
parameters
for
the
bargaining
relationship
and
it
made
pay
non-negotiable
for
most
employees
by...
by
inserting
the
proviso
that
matters
specifically
established
in
federal
statute
are
non-negotiable.
that's
just
the
way
it
was
done
under
the
executive
orders.
and
i
would
also
point
to
section
7135(b)
of
the
statute
where
congress
said
that
it
wanted,
among
other
things,
the
decisions
of
the
federal
labor
relations
council
to
continue
in
effect
or
until
changed
by
the
statute
itself
or
through
decisions
of
the
flra.
and
neither
of
those
events
have
occurred.
so
we
think
it
plain
that
congress'
treatment
of
the
executive
order
practice
makes
it
clear
that
it
intended
to
carry
that
practice
over.
but
the
debates
among
the
key
legislators
in
the
bill
also
support
that
conclusion.
the
legislators...
and
among
them
i
am
speaking
of
congressmen
clay,
ford,
udall
and
collins,
who
are
among
some
of
the
most
important
figures
in
the
enactment
of
the
statute...
all
said
and
made
clear
their
understanding
that
compensation
would
not
be
negotiable
under
the
statute
because
it
would
be
set
by
legislation
of
the
congress.
and
we
have
cited
these
passages
on
pages
28
and
29
of
our
brief.
and
these
remarks
must
form
our
backdrop
for
the
selected
excerpts
from
the
legislative
history
that
the
schools
rely
on
so
heavily
here,
where
legislators
would
simply
say
that
pay
would
be
non-negotiable
without
specifying
how
that
result
would
be
achieved.
and
yet
that
is
the
key
inquiry
for
the
legislative
history.
how
is
that
result
to
be
achieved?
and
as
i've
indicated,
we
think
it
plain
that
the
only
intent
for
those
remarks
can
be
to
make
it
non-negotiable
through
operation
of
legislation.
and
i
can
state
this
conclusion
with
a
very
sound
foundation,
and
that
is
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
because
if
congress
really
meant
by
those
remarks
that
it
wanted
to
pay...
make
pay
non-negotiable
as
a
subject
matter
per
se,
it
would
have
said
so
in
the
statute.
and
yet
we
will
look
long
and
hard
in
that
law
before
we
will
find
an
express
exclusion
of
pay
matters.
rather,
what
we
see
is,
well,
the
authority's
view
of
the
legislative
history
and
that
is
that
pay
is
made
non-negotiable
to
the
extent,
considerable
as
it
is,
that
congress
wanted
to
control
that
matter
through
legislation.
so
it
is
the
authority's
view
of
the
legislative
history
that
finds
voice
in
the
language
of
the
statute
and
not
the
schools'.
and
for
that
reason
we
think
the
authority's
view
should
be
affirmed.

employees
and
officials.
mr.
william
e.
persina
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
panel
decisions
are
reviewable
indirectly
for
sufficiency
with
law.
and
the
d.c.
circuit
has
so
held,
among
other
circuits
i
believe.
if
an
agency
employer
believes
their
panel
decision
is
contrary
to
law,
it
can
refuse
to
comply
with
that
panel
decision,
take
an
unfair
labor
practice
which
the
authority
would
resolve,
and
the
authority's
unfair
labor
practice
ruling
would
be
reviewed
in
an
appropriate
circuit
court
of
appeals.
so
there
is
indirect
review.
counsel
prison
locals
v.
brewer
is
the
primary
case
which
talks
about
that.
that
is
in
volume
735
f.
2d,
although
the
page
number
is
forgotten
to
me
at
the
moment.
but
we
would
also
note,
while
we
are
talking
about
the
panel,
there
is
at
least
one
case
that
i
know
of
where,
for
merchant
marine
academy
instructors,
the
panel
had
a
bargaining
pay...
an
impasse
in
bargaining
that
dealt
with
setting
pay.
and
the...
this
is
a
merchant
marine
case
where
the
panel
went
with
the
employer's
point
of
view.
that
is
the
one
we
know
of
where
salary
rates
themselves
were
the
primary
focus
of
the
impasse.
again,
these
don't
come
up
very
often
for
the
panel,
because
pay
is
non-negotiable
for
so
many
employees.
but
they
ruled
for
the
employer
in
that
case.
and
we
think
that
the
notion
that
the
panel
is
some
rogue
body
that
is
off
doing
irrational
things
and
can't
be
reviewed
is
simply
wrong.
they
have
demonstrated
responsible
conduct
in
this
area,
and
their
decisions
are
subject
to
review.
so
the--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
your
honor,
under
the
plain
language
of
section
7119
it
can
take
any
action
it
deems
necessary
to
resolve
an
impasse
and
that
could
include...
and
the
panel
has
frequently
not
adopted
either
the
employer
or
the
union,
but
has
developed
some
third
course.
in
concluding
on
the
conditions
of
employment
point,
i
would
just
like
to
note
briefly
concerning
these...
this
battle
over
the
outside
statutes
that
we
seem
to
be
engaged
in
here,
inappropriate
as
it
is,
we
think.
nonetheless,
we
think
these
outside
laws
are
very
much
supportive
of
our
case.
the
national
labor
relations
act
expressly
equates
wages
with
conditions
of
employment.
we
would
also
prefer
to
look
closer
to
home
for
the
statute.
that
is,
the
senior
executive
service
act,
which
again
expressly
equates
compensation
with
conditions
of
employments,
as
we've
pointed
out
in
our
brief.
the
senior
executive
service
law
is
another
title
of
the
civil
service
reform
act,
title
iv,
the
authority
is
under
title
vii.
and
here
in
the
reform
act
itself
is
congress'
recognition
that
compensation
is
a
form
of
a
condition
of
employment.
so
if
we
are
to
engage
in
this...
this
debate
about
what
do
outside
law
show,
we
think,
if
anything,
it's
supportive.
but
the
real
point,
we
think,
on
conditions
of
employment,
is
to
look
at
our
statute.
that's
the
statute
that's
before
us
and
that
statute
defines
the
very
term
that
we
are
seeking
to
construe
and
apply
here.
and
it
does
it
in
a
way
that
clearly
encompasses
compensation.
and
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
matter.
i
would
just
like
to
conclude
on
the
condition
of
employment
point
by
being
so
presumptuous,
i
think,
as
to
suggest
to
this
court
what
kind
of
opinion
it
would
have
to
write
in
order
to
grant
the
schools'
position
here.
first
of
all,
it
would
have
to
explain
why
it
is
that
compensation
is
not
a
personnel
policy,
practice
or
matter
affecting
working
conditions.
failing
that,
it
would
have
to
engraft
under
the
statute
an
exception
for
pay
which
is
not
in
the
law.
it
would
also
have
to
explain
why
it
is
that
the
key
legislators
in
the
statute
kept
saying
that
pay
would
be
non-negotiable
because
it
would
be
regulated
through
legislation.
and
the
court
would
also
have
to
identify
exactly
where
it
is
in
the
legislative
history
that
the...
that
the
congress
decided
that
it
did
not
want
to
carry
over
the
executive
order
practice.
that
is
a
very
daunting
task,
i
would
suggest.
we
think
that
it
is
a
task
that
need
not
be
confronted
because
the--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--it
would
be
very
interesting,
challenging,
and
i
would
enjoy
reading
it--
[laughter]
--very
much,
needless
to
say,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
persina
certainly.
but
the
task
need
not
be
faced
because
the
right
view
of
this
case
on
this
issue
is
the
authority's
point.
i'd
like
to
now
turn
to
the
budget
issue
and
that
test
that
we
consider
here,
whether
the
union's
proposals
constitute
or
entail
significant
and
unavoidable
costs
that
are
not
offset
by
compensating
benefits.
and
this
analysis
is
called
for
under
the
authority's
long-established
budget
test
for
determining
when
a
proposal
interferes
with
the
budget
right.
i
do
want
to
stress
again
the
reasonableness
of
this
test
is
an
accommodation.
many
of
the
bargaining
proposals
entail
a
facial
or
initial
cost,
and
that
reason
is...
cannot
be
enough
in
itself
to
find
that
proposal
to
be
non-negotiable.
and
indeed,
we
think
it--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--your
honor--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
your
honor,
i
can
think
of
little
to
add
beyond
what
i
already
have.
but
i
do
think
that
many
of
the
intangibles
have
a
tangible
outlet
and
that
we
cannot
separate
the
intangible
from
the
tangible
because
so
often
they
will
relate.
and,
again,
i
would
stress
that
the
authority
has
at
no
time
indicated
that
it
is
seeking
an
exact
dollar
and
cent
offset
as
an
accounting
certainty
in
order
to
satisfy
the
test.
but
i
do
think
that
the
particulars
of
the
administration
of
the
test,
as
far
as
how
intangibles
and
tangibles
are
married
up
by
the
authority,
is...
is
one
that
the
authority
is
entitled
to
develop
through
case
law
as
agency
employers
seek
to
comply
with
the
test,
which
this
one
and
others
have
not
done.
but
the
test...
to
do
otherwise,
we
think...
to
do
otherwise
in
a
compensating
benefits
analysis
would
restrict
the
scope
of
bargaining
so
severely
under
the
statute
that
congress
could
not
have
intended
that.
mr.
william
e.
persina
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
e.
persina
well,
to
negate...
to
negate
the
costs--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
yes,
your
honor.
the
burden
is
placed
on
the
employer,
and
i
think
its
properly
placed,
at
least
as
an
initial
matter,
for
two
very
good
reasons.
number
one,
it
is
the
employer
who
is
asserting
the
right.
number
two,
it
is
the
employer
who
knows
best
what
its
operation
is
all
about
and
what
sort
of
effects
a
particular
bargaining
proposal
will
have
on
that
operation
as
a
cost
matter.
and
again,
i
come
back
to
this
sort
of
analysis
as
being
something
that
is
not
at
all,
or
should
not
be
at
all,
alien
to...
to
agency
employers.
so
we
don't
think
that
the
burden
is
inappropriately
placed.
what
the...
what
the
employer
must
show
is
that
the
benefits
do
not
offset
the
costs.
and
again,
that
is
a
matter
that
is...
we
think
should
be
within
the
ability
of
agency
managers
to
do.
i
would
assume
they
do
it
in
the
absence
of
a
compensating
benefits
test
for
a
particular
course
of
action
they
may
have
under
consideration.
mr.
william
e.
persina
well,
your
honor,
i
cannot
say
that
the
authority
has
ever
addressed
whether
it
will
look
at
only
economic
benefits,
or
it
will
look
at
economic
and
intangible
benefits.
i
would
really
refer...
the
authority's
spoken
word
on
this
is
in
the
wright-patterson
test
where
it
gives
examples
of
compensating
benefits.
mr.
william
e.
persina
it's
not
the
first
time
the
question's
been
asked,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
persina
well,
congress,
when
it
decided
to
regulate
labor
relations
affairs
in
the
federal
government,
set
up
an
independent
establishment
in
the
executive
branch--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--the
authority,
to
adjudicate
matters
between
the
private
party,
unions--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--and
a
governmental
agency
in
its
capacity
as
an
employer.
mr.
william
e.
persina
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
william
e.
persina
well,
i
believe
that
is
the
case.
i...
there
is
a...
there
is
a
supreme
court
case
and
i
do
not
have
the
cite
at
my
fingertips--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--which
says
so
long
as
there
is
a
private
party
in
the
litigation,
then
all
of
the
elements
of...
of--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--well,
the
authority
does
have
specific
authority
to
represent
itself
in
the
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
william
e.
persina
we
do
not
have
that
authority
to
represent
ourselves
in
this
court
by
statute,
although
when
the
interests
of
the
solicitor
general's
office
and
those
of
the
authority
are
at
odds,
the
solicitor
general's
office
has
delegated
to
the
authority
that
responsibility
and
it
is
as
a--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--it
is--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--case-by-case
giving
consent
is
the
practice
that
has
developed.
the
authority
by
letter,
requests,
delegation--
mr.
william
e.
persina
--from
the
solicitor
general's
office,
and
that
delegation
is
given
in
writing.
mr.
william
e.
persina
which
was
true
in
this
case.
mr.
william
e.
persina
as
a
final
matter,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
issue
of
section
241
and
the
agency
regulation
which
purports
to
implement
that
statutory
section.
and
here
we
deal
with
the
authority's
compelling
need
criterion
as
to
whether
the
regulation
is
a
nondiscretionary
implementation
of
a
statutory
mandate.
in
other
words,
is
this
regulation
the
only
regulation
that
can
be
written
to
be
consistent
with
the
statute?
and
we
submit
that
it
clearly
is
not,
that
the
regulation
is
an
exercise
of
discretion
by
this
agency
and
therefore
cannot
bar
bargaining
under
the
federal
sector
labor
statute.
even
a
cursory
examination
of
section
241
reveals
that
it
does
not
require
identity
of
compensation
between
section
6
schools
and
local
schools.
rather,
section
241
sets
two
goals.
the
first
is
of
comparable
education
quality
to
local
schools,
and
the
second
is
that
that
education
be
provided
at
a
comparable
cost
or
equivalent
cost
to
local
schools.
overall
per-pupil
costs,
i
would
stress.
but
it
is
clear
that
this
section
does
not
restrict
the
discretion
of
how
the
agency
goes
about
meeting
those
bottom-line
statutory
goals.
under
section
241
these
schools
have
the
discretion
to
bargain
on
these
pay
proposals
and
still
to
meet
those
goals.
schools
can
configure
their
costs
over
the
various
aspects
of
providing
an
education
in
a
variety
of
different
ways,
and
no
one
way
can
be
said
to
provide
a
better
education
than
any
other
way.
it
would
simply
be
a
different
approach
to
the
problem
of
providing
a
quality
education
to
students.
for
example
in
this
case,
section
6
schools
could
seek
to
teach
math
through...
in
order
to
implement
these
proposals,
could
teach
math
by
hiring
more
master's
degree
teachers.
and
because,
if
they...
if
there
were
salary
increases
in
the
schools,
then
they
would
be
attracting
more
highly-qualified
people
to
teach
in
the
schools.
and
therefore,
they
could
teach
with
higher
quality
people
but
be
teaching
may
be
with
pencil
and
paper
instead
of
having
bachelor's
degree
teachers,
which
would
teach
with
electronic
calculators.
those
choices
under--
i
notice
that
my
time
has
expired.
