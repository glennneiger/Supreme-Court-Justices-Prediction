justice
o'connor
mr.
wright,
the...
the
employees
whose
wages
are
at
issue
here
are
not
employees
where
federal
law
sets
their
wage,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
o'connor
and
before
this
statute
was
enacted,
there
was
an
executive
order
that
provided
substantially
similar
provisions?
justice
o'connor
and
under
the
former
executive
order,
would
the
bargaining
proposal
here
have
been
upheld?
justice
o'connor
well,
don't
we
assume
they
understand?
when
have
we
gone
around
examining
whether
the
congressmen
have
the
read
cases?
justice
o'connor
but
that
comment
could
reflect
the
generality
of
the
fact
that
most
federal
employees
are...
are...
their
salaries
are
set
by
law.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
wright,
on
conditions
of
employment,
does
it
include,
in
your
view,
more
than
physical
working
conditions?
justice
o'connor
why
do
you
think
that
a
condition
of
employment
might
not
be
the
wage
that's
paid?
justice
o'connor
well
it
isn't...
the
term
isn't
self-explanatory.
justice
o'connor
then
why
wouldn't
we
defer
to
the
agency's
interpretation
of
it,
the
flra?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
is
difficult
to
think
that
you
place
an
economic
value
on
some
of
the
intangibles,
such
as
morale,
to
try
to
see
whether
in
fact
the
agency
has
to
increase
its
budget
to
pay
for
the
cost.
i
think--
justice
o'connor
--i
think
the
flra
position
on
that
requires
a
little
more
explanation
than
you've
given.
