justice
white
well,
have
you
been
authorized
to
represent
him?
justice
white
yeah.
justice
white
i'm
referring
to--
--simmons
is
the
guy
that--
--well,
what
is...
what
is
mr.
whitmore's
standing
to
even
be
here?
justice
white
was
he...
was
he
competent
to
waive
any
appeal
or--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
but
you
say
whitmore
has
got
a
separate
interest?
justice
white
xxx
just
any...
any
person...
any
member
of
the
public
can
come
in
and
say
simmons'
waiver
was
invalid
and
therefore
i
want
to
appeal
his
case.
justice
white
so
the
fact
that...
so
the
fact
that
the
waiver,
you
say,
is
questionable
really
doesn't
add
anything
to
whitmore's
standing,
is
it?
justice
white
well,
what
if...
what
if
there
isn't
mandatory
appeal?
how
would
that...
how
do
the
other
states
handle
this
when,
if
it
ever
happens,
the...
the
condemned
person
doesn't
want
to
appeal.
do
they
just...
don't
they
just
appoint
a
lawyer--
justice
white
--for
him?
justice
white
that
doesn't
mean
that
any
third
person,
cellmate
or
otherwise,
could
come
in
and
appeal
it.
justice
white
well,
i--
justice
white
--i
know,
but
that
doesn't
help.
having
a
mandatory
appeal
doesn't
help
whitmore
very
much.
justice
white
well,
i'm
just
saying
it
doesn't
help
him
very
much.
even
if
there...
there
were
a
mandatory
appeal,
he
wouldn't
have
any
more
standing
to
exercise
that
right
to
appeal.
justice
white
you
would
be--
justice
white
xxx
willing?
or
did
he
say,
"i
want
to
waive"?
is
that
it?
justice
white
and
he
doesn't
want...
and
he
turns
down
any...
has
he
turned
down
any
kind
of
representation
by
anybody
else?
justice
white
and
has
he
purported
to
forbid
mr.
whitmore
to
represent
him?
justice
white
i...
was
this
briefed?
did
he
file
a
brief
in
this
case?
justice
white
and
has
he...
has
he
read
that
brief?
justice
white
how
about
a
public
defender
who
says,
i
want
to
go
ahead
and
talk
to
this
inmate?
justice
white
oh,
no.
no.
that
isn't--
justice
white
--it's
on
the
standing
argument.
take
justice
stevens'
question.
here
is
a
public
defender
that
represented
him
all
up
and
down
the
line
in
the...
in
the
proceedings
and
he
shows
up
at
the
prison
and
he
finds
out
that
the
fellow
is
in
a
dungeon
and
they
won't
let...
and
they
won't
let
him
talk
to
him.
justice
white
could
he
get
into
court?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
say
that...
you
say
that
if
this
fellow
changed
his
mind
an
hour
before
his
execution
was
scheduled,
he'd
get
an
appeal.
justice
white
well,
then
the
public
defender
wants
to
be
able
to
talk
to
him
up
till
the
minute
of
the
execution
and
the
people...
and
the
prison
says,
sorry,
the
fellow's
waived
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
