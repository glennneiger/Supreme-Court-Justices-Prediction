why
isn't
that
hypothetical?
you...
you...
you
had
just
finished
saying
that
the
injury
has
to
be
something
more
than
hypothetical.
why
isn't
it
hypothetical
that
your...
that
your
client
will
get
his
conviction
set
aside
and
be
tried
again?
justice
scalia
well,
i
assume
the
difference
between
future
and
hypothetical
is
sort
of
the
difference
between
standing
under
a
chandelier
whose...
whose
connection
has
broken
and
is...
is...
is
in
the
process
of
descending
on
your
head.
that's
a
future
injury.
and
a
hypothetical
injury
would
be
standing
under
a
chandelier
that
is
perfectly
well-attached
to
the
ceiling.
now,
why
isn't
your
client
in
the
latter
case?
justice
scalia
in
the
latter
situation?
there
is
nothing
happening...
about
to
happen
to
him.
it
all
depends
on
his
getting
his
conviction
set
aside.
that's
purely
hypothetical
that
it'll
do
that.
if
and
when
it's
aside,
then
i
suppose
you
can
say
it's...
it's
sure
that
mr.
simmons'
case
will
be
left
out
of
the
pool.
that's
in
the
future
to
be
sure,
but
not
hypothetical.
at
this
stage
it's
still
hypothetical,
though,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
mr.
allen,
could
i
ask
you...
assuming
that
you
have
standing,
do
you
know
any
case
where
we've
allowed
someone
who
would...
assuming
he
would
be
injured
by
something
that
occurred
at
the
trial
level,
we've
allowed
someone
not
to
intervene
down
there
but
to
bring
an
appeal
here
on
the
basis
of
that
standing?
i
mean,
i...
i
would
think
that
if
i
sit
out
a
proceeding
in
the
district
court
that
might
affect
me,
i'm
out
of
luck.
i
can't
then
come
in
at
the
court
of
appeals
level
and
say
i
want
to
appeal
that.
now,
maybe
i
can
bring
a
separate
lawsuit...
maybe
i
can
bring
a
separate
lawsuit
to
set
aside
that
district
court
judgment,
but
this...
this
seems
to
me
a
very
strange
procedure.
assuming
you...
assuming
there
is
a
real
interest
here
that
would
confer
standing,
does
it...
does
it
enable
you
to
sort
of
jump
into
a
lawsuit,
in
the
middle
of
it,
and
appeal
a...
appeal
a
suit
that
hasn't
otherwise
been
appealed?
justice
scalia
he
wasn't
asserting
his
own
standing.
he
was...
he
was
asserting
the
standing
of
the...
of
the
convicted
person
himself,
wasn't
he?
wasn't
he
just
trying
to
come
in
as
next
friend?
justice
scalia
so
that's
quite
different
from
what
you're
trying
to
do
here.
justice
scalia
let
me
ask
you
one
question,
if
i
might,
counsel.
justice
scalia
it's
running
through
my
mind.
supposing
the
case
were
different
and
that
this
man
had...
did
not
have
clear
access
to
the
courts...
and
you
demonstrate
that
he
did
have
access
to
the
courts.
but,
say,
you
had
a
case
in
which
an
allegation
by
a
stranger
like
the
petitioner
here
came
in
and
said,
my
only
relationship
with
him
is
i'm
in
the
same
death
row
that
he's
in
and
i'd
like
to
have
standing
to
assert
on
his
behalf
a
claim
that
he's
been
denied
access
to
the
courts
because
he's
been
kept
in
a
dungeon
without
being
able
to
get
to
a
lawyer
or
something
of
that
kind.
would
he
have
standing
then?
