justice
kennedy
well,
you're
not
arguing
that
the
simmons'
waiver
was
invalid,
are
you?
justice
kennedy
--in
the...
the
contingency
i
think
the
remote
contingency
that
whitmore
is
retried
and
sentenced
to
death
again...
couldn't
he
at
that
time
argue
that
it's
the
state's
burden
to
show
that
his
sentence
is
proportional
and
the
state
has
in
effect,
by
its
own
procedures,
denied
him
the
right
to
have
a
pool
of
cases
and
just
put
the
burden
on
the
state.
justice
kennedy
well,
but
i
mean,
if
by
the
state's
own
actions
that
independent
review
is
somehow
inadequate,
it
seems
to
me
that
whitmore
again
has
no
injury
because
then
he's
going
to
be
able
to
raise
the
very
contention
that
you
say
he
can't
make.
justice
kennedy
he...
he
wouldn't
have
an
injury
because
he
tells
the
state
that
you
have
to
show
that
my
death
penalty
is
proportional
and
you
can't
do
it.
so
you're
not
being
injured
by
what's
happening
here.
justice
kennedy
well,
but
we're
talking
about
whitmore's
injury
by
hypothesis.
justice
kennedy
he
has
appointed
counsel
now?
justice
kennedy
or
retained
counsel.
justice
kennedy
do...
do
we
know
that
that
retained
counsel
will
remain
with
him
throughout
the
period
during
which
the
sentence
is
being
executed,
up
to
the
last
hour?
justice
kennedy
if
he
does,
what's
the
state
of
preparation
of
the
trial
transcript?
justice
kennedy
what...
what
does
the
transcript
consist
of?
or,
what's
the
record
of
the
trial
consist
of?
of
recorded
notes
or
reporter's
notes?
justice
kennedy
well,
you're
not
at
all
disturbed
that
there's
no
extant
record
of
this
trial?
