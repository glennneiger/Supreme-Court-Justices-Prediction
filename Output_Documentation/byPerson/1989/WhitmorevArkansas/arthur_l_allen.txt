mr.
arthur
l.
allen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
february
10th
of
1989
ronald
gene
simmons
was
convicted
of
capital
murder
and
sentenced
to
death
by
a
lethal
injection
in
the
state
of
arkansas.
his
execution
date
was
set
for
march
16th
of
1989,
approximately
five
weeks
after
his
conviction.
mr.
simmons
expressed
a
desire
that
no
appeal
be
taken
in
his
case
and
that
the
sentence
of
the
jury
be
carried
out
as
ordered.
there
was
an
intervention
filed,
as
had
been
done
in
a
previous
sentence
of
death
rendered
against
mr.
simmons
in
the
earlier
case
which
we've
called
in
our
brief
simmons
i
for
clarity.
the
arkansas
supreme
court
ruled
upon
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
a
mandatory
appellate
review
in
a
death
penalty
case.
with
a
rather
cursory
look
at
some
of
the
opinions
of
this
court,
notably
gregg
v.
georgia,
jurek
v.
texas,
proffitt
v.
florida,
the
arkansas
supreme
court
found
no
constitutional
requirement
of
an
appellate
review.
and
that
trial
and
conviction
occurred
in
1988.
the
trial
in
february
of
'89
had
no
appellate
record
made,
no...
or
no
transcript
prepared
for
appellate
review.
there
was,
in
accordance
with
ruling
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court,
a
hearing
held
in
the
trial
court
level
to
determine
mr.
simmons'
competency
to
waive
appellate
review.
he
was
examined
by
a
psychiatrist
at
the
arkansas
state
hospital
and
was
determined
to
be
competent
to
make
that
waiver.
although
in
a
later
hearing
there
was
some
reservation
expressed
by
the
examining
psychiatrist
concerning
some
more
recent
expressions
from
mr.
simmons
that
may
have
expressed
a
degree
of
mental
disorder,
neither
the
trial
court
nor
the
reviewing
court
on
appeal
found
these
to
be
significant
enough
to
make
his
waiver
involuntary.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
your
honor,
his
standing
is
predicated
upon
several
things.
in
the
state
of
arkansas,
although
not
constitutionally
required
to
do
so,
our
supreme
court
has
committed
itself
since
the
1970s
to
a
system
of
comparative
review
in
death
penalty
cases.
in
other
words,
they
have
taken
the
issue
that
this
court
looked
in
pulley
v.
harris
and
made
it
a
part
of
state
law
to
say
that
in
each
death
penalty
case
they
will
review
that
individual's
crime
against
other
capital
cases
in
the
state
of
arkansas.
in
this
instance,
the
state
has
not
put
mr.
simmons'
conviction
and
the
attendant
facts
within
that
data
pool
that
mr.
whitmore
is
to
be
compared
against.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
it
has...
it
has
been
affirmed
on
direct
appeal.
it
has
been
affirmed
in
state
post-conviction
proceedings,
which
have
now
been
abolished
in
the
state
of
arkansas,
at...
and
is
currently
in
federal
habeas.
at
the
state
post-conviction
stage,
the
state
of
arkansas
in
its
briefs
conceded
that
mr.
whitmore
was
entitled
to
a
hearing.
not
a
concession
as
to
the
merits,
but
a
concession
as
to
a
hearing
on
several
grounds
in
his
case.
mr.
whitmore's
position
is
unlike
all
other
citizens
of
the
state.
he
has
a
particular
concrete
injury.
if
he,
as
a
member
of
that
much
smaller
subset
of
people
facing
the
possibility
of
a
trial,
is
again
convicted,
then
mr.
simmons--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--no,
sir.
if
he
obtains
a
new
trial
and
is
again
convicted.
of
course,
the
state...
and
this
is
what
the
respondent
has
largely
argued
as
their
position...
is
that
mr.
whitmore
does
not
have
standing.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
mr.
whitmore?
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
are
you
referring
to
mr.
whitmore,
sir?
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
mr.
whitmore,
under
the
standing,
of
course,
to
reach
the
article
iii
case
for
controversy,
has
to
show
an
injury.
and
of
course,
as
the
cases
here
have
held,
with
perhaps
not--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--mr.
simmons?
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
on
the
record
before
this
court
i
cannot
seriously
dispute
competency
as
it
relates
to
mental
competency.
competency,
though,
is
a
two-part
question.
one
is,
of
course...
or,
a
part
of
that
question
is
his
mental
competency.
despite
some
reservation
from--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--yes,
sir.
he
has
a
separate
interest.
now,
concededly
i...
i
cannot
present
to
this
court
that
it
is
overwhelming,
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
proper
test
to
apply
is
the
one
of
justice
brennan's
comments
in
his
dissent
to
valley
forge,
which
is
that
the
dividing
line
should
be
no
injury
and
some
injury
rather
than
asking
the
court
to
get
into
weighing
and
assessing
the
total
weight
of
the
injury.
to
reach
standing
he
needs
to
show
a
personal
injury
to
himself.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
well,
your
honor,
again--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--it
cannot
be
a
hypothetical
or--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--oh,
i
don't
think
the
court
used
that
expression.
one
expression
what
was
used
in
a
slightly
earlier
case,
the
scrap
case,
was
that
a
mere
trifle
may
be
sufficient.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
and,
of
course--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--your
honor,
the
difference
there
is
the
difference
between
future
or
threatened
injury
and
hypothetical.
hypothetical
assumes
all
facts,
whereas...
and
again,
the
court
has
in
a
number
of
decisions,
including
o'shea,
and
in
fact
in
a
footnote
to
valley
forge,
looked
at
threatened
injury.
so,
it's
clear
that
the
injury
can
be
a
future
injury.
that's
mr.
whitmore's
personal
interest
in
this.
there
are
other
reasons,
as
cited
in
the
brief,
for
allowing
standing
to
mr.
whitmore.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
because--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--no,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
it's
not
hypothetical.
it
is
perhaps
slight.
but
there
is
a
threatened
injury
to
mr.
whitmore
of
a
right
asserted
to
him
by
the
state
of
arkansas.
however
slight
that
may
be,
whether
in
fact
the
court
might
consider
it
to
be
a
trifle.
within
the
context
of
eighth
amendment
death
penalty
considerations,
virtually
anything
that
influences
the
ultimate
decision
to
impose
a
penalty
of
death
should
not
be
considered
merely
trifling
or
even
hypothetical.
the
other
reasons
for
standing
as
regards
mr.
whitmore
again
go
back...
to
look
at
earlier
cases
of
this
court.
a
part
of
the
ability
to
proceed
in
behalf
of
a
third
person
is
the
adequacy
or
inadequacy
of
the
waiver
made.
as
the
arkansas
court's
opinion,
as
set
out
in
the
joint
appendix
shows,
they
used
the
rees
v.
peyton
test,
which
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
competency
to
stand
trial,
to
waive
a
jury.
what
they
did
not
look
at
was
the
adequacy
of
how
knowingly
and
intelligently
mr.
simmons
has
made
this
wavier.
who,
for
example,
has
said
to
him:
you
may
not
be
eligible
for
the
death
penalty?
the
only
advice
he
has
had
as
regards
to
this
case
is
the
advice
of
the
trial
counsel
who
have
adamantly
and
vigorously
advocated
that
their
own
client
be
put
to
death,
who
have
filed
as
respondent
briefs
in
this
court
statements
which
say
that
they
are
not
familiar
enough
with
the
death
penalty
laws
in
the
state
of
arkansas
to
present
that
issue
as
opposed
to
the
attorney
general
for
the
state
of
arkansas.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
i
seriously
question
the
validity
of
that
waiver
under
those
circumstances.
the
advice
that
he
has
had
in
this
case,
distinguishing
it
from
his
earlier
conviction...
no
one
other
than
the
trial
counsel
have
advised
him
as
to
trial
errors.
now,
the
trial
judge,
based
upon
representations
made
by
trial
counsel,
has
advised
him
of
potential
error.
now,
in
simmons
i,
the
earlier
case
that
was
tried
in
1988,
it
went
into
federal
habeas.
the
federal
district
court
appointed
an
independent
attorney,
ordered
a
transcript
to
be
prepared...
and,
in
fact,
i
think
had
to
threaten
the
court
reporter
with
contempt
to
get
a
transcript
prepared.
there
was
then
a
lengthy
report
filed
with
the
federal
court
outlining
various
potential
errors.
and,
in
fact,
that
independent
report
on
the
first
conviction
showed
at
least
seven
grounds
of
reversible
error,
one
of
which
would
have
negated
the
death
penalty.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
your
honor,
this
court
has
only
addressed
waivers
in
death
penalty
context
after
they
have
reached
habeas...
with
the
exception
of
gilmore,
which
we
have
yet
to
discuss.
but
this
court
has
never
discussed
it
in
the
context
of
waiving
a
direct
first
appellate
review.
you
have
looked
at
it
in
collateral
proceedings,
post-conviction
and
federal
habeas,
wherein
the
harm
that
we
are
seeking
to
redress
here
did
not
occur
because
there
had
been
an
appellate
review.
the
probably
best
analogy
for
another
reason
to
grant
standing
is
a
review
of
this
court's
cases
in
the
area
of
the
first
amendment,
the
heightened
interest
that
the
court
has
shown.
for
example,
from
cases
going
back
through
raines,
through
naacp
v.
alabama,
griswold,
eisenstadt,
the
court
has
not
hesitated
to
allow...
i
shouldn't
say
has
not
hesitated
because
not
all
opinions
have
been
unanimous...
but
certainly
the
gist
and
the
thrust
of
this
is
that
the
rights
of
third
parties
may
in
fact
be
asserted.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
yes,
sir.
i
would.
and,
of
course,
to
reach
that
point,
to
take
it
out
of
the
realm
of
the
hypothetical,
there
has
to
be
an
injury,
which
is
what
we
are
alleging
on
behalf
of
mr.
whitmore.
and
the
court
has
again--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--your
honor,
as
much,
perhaps,
as
i
would
like
to
advocate
that,
i
think
this
court's
decisions
are
uniform
in
showing
that
generalized
grievances
are
redressable
through
the
political
front
rather
than
through
the
judicial
front.
that
almost--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--it
does...
it,
of
itself,
doesn't
add
anything
more
to
his
standing.
in
other
words,
his
injury
is
the
first
threshold
that
has
to
be
addressed.
but
in
the
presence
of...
again,
to
use
phrases
from
the
cases...
weighty
countervailing
policies,
which
there
can
hardly
be,
even
with
the
importance
of
the
first
amendment,
a
weightier
issue
than
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
that
the
standing
requirement,
that
threshold
requirement,
may
in
fact
be
lowered
almost
on
a
balancing
basis.
the
importance
of
the
interest,
the
lowering
of
that
first
threshold
question.
that--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--there
is
a
strange...
or
an
appearance
of
strangeness
here,
your
honor,
because
of
the
absence
of
simmons
i
from
being
with
this.
in
simmons
i,
the
intervenor
was
a
catholic
priest,
father
franz,
who
filed
at
the
trial
court
level
to
appeal
and
to
order
a
transcript
prepared.
the
trial
court
dismissed
that
appeal
at
the
trial
court
level
and
refused
to
have
a
transcript
prepared
even
though
that
intervenor
was,
as
i
understand
it,
prepared
to
pay
for
the
transcript.
so--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--yes.
and
that's--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--well,
that's
the
reason
i
believe
that
franz
v.
state
failed
on
its
face,
is
that
it
did
not
express
more
than
a
generalized
grievance
over
a
constitutional
defect.
that's
what
distinguishes
mr.
whitmore's
position,
is
that
rather
than
a
generalized
grievance
saying
the
state
of
arkansas,
nor
any
other
state,
should
execute
an
individual
who
has
not
had
the
full
continuum
of
rights
guaranteed
under
the
eighth
amendment.
the
state
would
ask
that
the
appeals
process
be
looked
at
as
a
separate
and
discrete
part
of
the
process.
you
go
to
trial
and
from
whatever
happens
through
that
point
on
is
separate.
that's,
i
believe,
not
a
correct
position
in
the
context
of
death
penalty
cases,
partially
because
death
is
in
fact
different.
it's
entitled
to
higher
safeguards,
to
perhaps
unique
procedures
to
ensure
that
it's
not
unfairly
imposed;
that...
excuse
me...
that
it
relates
to
appropriate
penalties
for
certain
crimes,
as
in
coker,
for
example;
that
it
only
is
imposed
on
deserving
defendants,
as
in
jurek
v.
texas;
that
mitigation
is
allowed
in
its
full
scope...
lockett,
skipper.
and
the
importance...
the
constitutional
importance
of
the
appellate
review
has
been
addressed
in
a
number
of
cases
in
this
court...
that...
i
won't
go
back
through
that
argument
at
any
length.
as
early
as
gregg,
of
course,
the
court
has
said
that
the
presence
of
a
mandatory
appeal
was
an
important
component
of
allowing
a
state's
death
penalty
statute
to
stand.
more
recently,
the
court
has
looked
at
other
statutes
and
has
upheld
them
in
part
based
upon
the
presence
of
that
mandatory
appeal
feature.
arkansas,
of
course,
is
the
only
one
of
37
states
that
impose
the
death
penalty
that
do
not
have
this
requirement
of
a
non-waiverable
death
penalty,
either
by
statute
or
by
case
law.
even
the
state
of
utah
that
carried
out
the
execution
of
mr.
gilmore
amended
its
laws
within
six
months
after
that
execution
so
that
it
could
not
be
carried
out
today
in
utah
without
mandatory
appellate
review.
the...
excuse
me...
the
absence
of
that
feature
renders
the
arkansas
death
penalty
statute
unconstitutional,
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
mr.
simmons.
mr.
simmons
and
the
state
of
arkansas
will
assert
some
right
to
personal
autonomy,
that
mr.
simmons'
wishes
should
be
respected.
the
problem
with
that
is
that
we're
dealing
with
something
or
right
that
also
exists
for
the
benefit
of
society
as
a
whole.
we're--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
yes,
sir.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
no.
but,
of
course,
that
would
not
be
necessary
in
any
of
those
36
states
since--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--they
have
a
procedure
in
place.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
your
honor,
it
only...
that
feature
of
it
goes
to
the
weight
of
the
countervailing
policy,
which
in
turn
affects
the
threshold
of
injury
that
mr.
whitmore
must
show
in
this
court
to
achieve
his
standing.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
if
there
were
a
mandatory
appeal,
of
course,
your
honor--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--we
would
not
be...
be
before
the
court
on
this
issue.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
arkansas
does
not
place
the
burden
in
that
regard
upon
either
the
state
or
the
convicted.
they
do
an
independent
review
themselves.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
your
honor,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
a
matter
of
him
not
having
an
injury,
but
it
would
be
a
matter
of
could
he
address
it
in
another
forum
at
that
time.
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
of
course,
at
that
time
mr.
simmons
would
have
been
long
since
executed.
that
might--
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
--yes,
sir.
and
that
might
at
that
point
be
more
closely
attuned
to
the
hypothetical
question
that
justice
scalia
raised.
mr.
simmons
gone,
no
longer
in
the
picture,
was
he
hypothetically
harmed?
that,
at
that
point,
might
become
hypothetical.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
may
i
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
arthur
l.
allen
very
briefly.
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
it
bothers
me
very
much,
your
honor,
particularly
when
that
answer
is
related
back
to
an
earlier
statement
of
the
attorney
general
that
there
were
seven
issues
presented
that
might
have
successfully
set
aside
the
death
penalty.
there
were
that
many
issues
presented
in
simmons
i.
respondent
has
said
there
were
that
many
in
simmons
ii.
what
that
is
saying
is
that
this
may
in
fact
be
a
person
who
is
not
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
under
the
law.
and
respondent
is
not
bothered
with
that.
the
question
of
retained
counsel...
and
coming
back
to
the
adequacy
of
that
waiver...
and
i
believe
mr.
justice
kennedy
asked
about
whether
counsel
would
stay
on
the
case.
there
is
no
indication
of
that.
in
fact,
there
has
been
some
published
comments
made
recently
that
would
suggest
they
probably
will
not,
other
than
perhaps
a
book
deal
coming
through
on
this.
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
page
17
of
those
counsel's
respondent's
brief
only
to
give
the
court
a
feel
for
the
representation
that
mr.
simmons
received
at
his
trial.
the
counsel
in
there
who
speak
of
penumbras
emanating
from
the
third
amendment
in
cases
from
this
court,
who,
as
i
said
a
moment
ago,
on
that
same
page
indicated
that
they
were
not
familiar
enough
with
the
death
penalty
procedures
in
the
state
of
arkansas
to
present...
to
present
argument
on
that
point
in
this
court.
thank
you.
