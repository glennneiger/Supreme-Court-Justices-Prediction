justice
stevens
would
any
person...
just
a
citizen
of
arkansas
who
says,
we
don't
really
like
having
the
state
behave
in
this
fashion...
would
any...
would
anybody
have
standing
to
bring
that
matter
to
the
attention
of
a
federal
court?
justice
stevens
the
only
thing
i
am
suggesting,
counsel,
is
that
perhaps
you're
right
on
the
merits
with
the
waiver
and
all
the
rest
of
it,
but
the
standing
position
could
be
quite
extreme
in
some...
in
some
cases,
i
think.
justice
stevens
of
course,
maybe
that
doesn't
mean
that
it
isn't...
it
isn't--
justice
stevens
--yeah.
justice
stevens
yeah.
