chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
88-7146,
jonas
whitmore
v.
arkansas.
mr.
allen.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
allen,
you
represent
jonas
whitmore
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
is
mr.
whitmore's
standing
before
this
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
hasn't
mr.
whitmore's
conviction
already
been
affirmed?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
mean?
you
mean
if
he's
convicted
of
a
second
capital
murder?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
of
some
substance.
not
just
a
trivial
thing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
certainly,
that
was...
that
was
the
rule
of
valley
forge,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
but
i
mean,
even
if
it's
actual
it
has
to
be
something
beyond
a
mere
peppercorn,
so
to
speak.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
your
claim
here
is
that
although
your
client
has
already
had
his
conviction
affirmed
and
the
proportionality
review
conducted
by
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
he...
and
has
lost
in
state
post-conviction
remedies,
he
is
now
in
federal
habeas
and
he
might
obtain
a
new
trial
there
and
then
he
would
go
through
the
proceeding
again
and
would
be
affected
by
the
fact
that
mr.
simmons'
capital
case
was
not
in
the
pool
from
which
a
proportionality
review
is
convicted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
any
case
from
our
court
require
that
extensive
a
proceeding
as
you've
just
described
in
order
that
a
waiver
be
deemed
competent?
chief
justice
rehnquist
by
someone
who
himself
has
standing,
who
himself
has
suffered
an
injury.
chief
justice
rehnquist
wouldn't
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
you
may,
mr.
allen.
general
clark.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you...
thank
you,
general
clark.
mr.
allen,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
allen.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
whitmore
against
arkansas.
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
jonas
whitmore,
sought
to
intervene
in
a
proceeding
in
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
to
challenge
the
murder
convictions
and
death
sentence
of
another
man,
ronald
gene
simmons.
after
simmons
had
been
tried
and
sentenced,
he
declared
that
he
wanted
to
forego
any
appellate
review.
the
trial
court
conducted
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
it
decided
that
simmons
was
competent
to
waive
any
rights
available
to
him.
the
supreme
court
of
arkansas
affirmed
that
decision.
whitmore,
who
was
also
an
inmate
on
death
row,
moved
to
intervene
in
the
state
supreme
court
in
order
to
pursue
simmons
appeal
but
the
supreme
court
denied
his
motion.
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide
whether
whitmore
has
standing
to
seek
relief
in
this
court
and
if
so,
whether
the
eighth
amendment
requires
arkansas
to
carryout
an
appellate
review
of
smimons
since
before
going
through
with
the
execution.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
whitmore
does
not
have
standing
in
this
court.
he
has
not
sustained
injury
in
fact
sufficient
to
establish
an
article
iii
case
or
controversy,
because
any
harm
to
whitmore
caused
by
simmons'
failure
to
appeal
is
purely
speculative,
nor
we
hold
that
whitmore
have
standing
to
proceed
as
what
is
called
the
"next
friend"
of
simmons.
standing
in
that
capacity
is
not
available
whereas
here,
an
evidentiary
hearing
shows
that
the
defendant
has
given
a
knowing,
intelligent,
involuntary
waiver
of
his
right
to
proceed
and
has
access
to
court
as
otherwise
impaired.
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
therefore
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
brennan
has
joined.
