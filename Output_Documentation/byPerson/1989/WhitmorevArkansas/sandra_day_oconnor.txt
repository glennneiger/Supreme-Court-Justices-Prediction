justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
we
don't
have
to
even
get
to
that
point
if
there's
no
standing
here.
justice
o'connor
so
probably
that's
the
first
thing
we
look
at,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
he
would
have
standing
if
he
were
here
in
a
situation
where
his
own
proportionality
review
had
not
been
conducted
yet?
justice
o'connor
isn't
that
case
on
appeal
now
in
the
eighth--
justice
o'connor
--circuit?
