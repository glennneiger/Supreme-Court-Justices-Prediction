mr.
j.
steven
clark
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
state
of
arkansas
in
this
case
is
simple
and
direct.
first
of
all,
jonas
whitmore,
the
petitioner,
does
not
present
this
court
a
case
in
controversy,
as
required
under
article
iii,
section
2
of
the
constitution,
simply
because
ronald
gene
simmons
is
not
a
minor.
as
to
the
issue
of
his
competency,
he
has
been
found
competent
by
trial
counsel
and
also
by
counsel
who...
psychiatry...
a
psychiatrist
who
examined
him
on
behalf
of
his
own
retained
counsel.
he
has
never
used
incompetency
as
a
defense.
he
pled
not
guilty
in
either
simmons
i
and
simmons
ii.
and,
thirdly,
the
protected
right
that
jonas
whitmore
so
allegedly
advances
to
this
court,
or
the
right
that
should
be
protected
by
this
court
that
gives
him
standing,
is
one
that
clearly
is
speculative
or
conjecture
or
hypothetical
because,
as
you
have
heard,
in
his
conviction
for
a
capital
offense
he
was
sentenced
to
die
by
injection.
he
had
a
direct
appeal.
in
that
direct
appeal
there
was
a
proportionality
review
made
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
in
its
opinion,
it
told
us
specifically
how
it
did
that.
it
contrasted
jonas
whitmore
against
other
death
row
inmates
who
were
guilty
of
crimes
similar
to
his.
he
took
the
life
of
one
individual
in
a
robbery.
his
proportionality
study
was
against
two
other
death
row
inmates,
mr.
woodward
and
mr.
fretwell,
who
also
took
one
life
in
the
perpetration
of
a
robbery.
they
did
not
contrast
him
against
a
mass
murderer,
but
they
contrasted
him
against
someone
on
death
row
who
received
the
penalty
of
death
similar
to
the
circumstances
in
the
case
in
which
it
was
imposed
against
him.
i
submit
to
you
that
simply
what
we
have
here
after
the
post-conviction
relief
was
denied
was
a
situation
where
mr.
whitmore
is
before
this
court
for
the
reason
that
he
would
love
to
frustrate
the
death
penalty
process
in
arkansas
because
by
frustrating
it
he
slows
its
implementation
against
him.
but
he
has
no
standing
here,
none
whatsoever.
he
has
not
alleged
or
articulated
one
fact
that
shows
that
he
has
any
particular
legal
interest
that
is
at
risk
or
at
jeopardy
by
the
state
going
forward
with
the
execution
of
ronald
gene
simmons.
but,
secondly,
if
this
court
should
find
for
some
reason
that
there
is
standing
in
this
case,
i
further
submit
to
you
that
the
state
of
arkansas'
death
penalty
procedures
are
constitutional
and
are
not
violative
of
the
eighth
amendment,
and
we
do
not
impose
the
penalty
of
death
in
an
arbitrary,
capricious
or
freakish
manner.
this
court
has
said
since
the
trilogy
of
cases
of
proffitt
and
jurek
and
gregg
that
when
you
decided
the
case
in
spaziano
that
there
was
not
one
right
way...
you
didn't
single
out
that
there
was
one
right
way
to
have
the
death
penalty
process
applied.
you
further
said
in
pulley
that
when
you
looked
at
this
process
you
looked
at
the
whole
of
the
process.
i
submit
to
you
that
the
arkansas
death
penalty
procedures
provide
more
than
adequate
safeguards
to
ensure
that
there
is
no
arbitrary
or
capricious
application
of
this
penalty
of
death
by
simply
providing
the
following.
first,
in
arkansas
you
can
only
have
the
penalty
of
death
imply...
applied
against
you
by
a
jury.
you
cannot
come
forward
and
plead
guilty
and
have
that
penalty
applied
by
a
sitting
trial
judge.
only
by
a
jury.
in
our
bifurcated
system,
in
terms
of
death
penalty
cases,
we
must
first
adjudicate
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
then
we
move
to
the
sentencing
phase.
additional
safeguards
that
we
find
there
are
these.
first
of
all,
the
state
must
prove
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
one
of
seven
aggravating
circumstances,
and
the
jury
must
unanimously
concur
in
that
and
sign
that
they
are
of
that
opinion.
we
are
bound
by
strict
rules
of
evidence
in
that
phase
of
the
sentencing.
secondly,
in
that
sentencing
phase,
the
defendant
is
allowed
to
offer
any
evidence
of
mitigation
that
he
would
like
to
offer
against
the
state's
aggravating
circumstance.
he
is
not
bound
by
strict
rules
of
evidence.
and
the
jury
must
conclude,
again
unanimously,
that
the
aggravation
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
outweighs
the
mitigation.
thirdly,
the
state
of
arkansas
then
is
required
to
prove
to
that
same
jury
that
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
only
proper
punishment
that
can
be
assessed
is
the
penalty
of
death,
having
a
jury
instructed
that
they
are
permitted
to
impose
the
sentence
of
life
without
parole.
meeting
all
of
that
burden,
there
is
one
additional
safeguard
in
the
arkansas
death
penalty
procedures,
and
that
is
one
that
simply
says
that
the
trial
judge,
after
hearing...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
thirty-two
people
on
death
row,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
there
was
one,
but
her
case
was
overturned
and
she's
now
serving
life
without
parole.
there
are
32
males
on
death
row,
11
of
which
are
black,
and
the
remainder
are
white
or
hispanic.
the
final
safeguard,
though,
in
the
instance
of
a
death
penalty
procedure
in
arkansas
is
that
once
the
trial
judge
hears
the
implementation
of
the
sentence,
the
trial
judge
on
his
own
motion
can
set
aside
the
penalty
of
death
and
order
the
penalty
of
life
without
parole.
and
so
i'll
simply
say
to
you
that
those
safeguards
rise
to
a
standard
that
ensures
that
the
eighth
amendment
is
not
violated
in
the
sense
that
it
is
arbitrarily
or
capriciously
applied
or
in
some
freakish
fashion.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
justice
o'connor,
i
agree.
if
there
is
no
standing,
you
do
not
need
to
get
to
those
issues,
and
i
submit
there
is
no
standing.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor.
i
submit
that
that
is
the
first
thing
you
look
at.
in
this
instance,
jonas
whitmore
has
failed
to
give
this
court
any
indication
that
he
has
standing
by
decisions
that
you
have
articulated.
simply,
he
has
no
right
to
be
protected.
it
is
purely
speculative
that
at
some
point
in
the
future
in
his
petition
at
habeas
where
he
alleges
a
state
of
incompetence
that
he
might...
he
might...
get
a
court
to
set
that
aside
and
get
a
new
trial
in
arkansas
and
not
have
a
proportionality
review
that
includes
simmons.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
i
think
in
the
instance
of
jonas
whitmore,
had
he
not
taken
a
direct
appeal
at
this
point,
he
still
would
not
have
standing
before
this
court
because
the
proportionality
review
process
in
arkansas
is
one
that
has
never
been
articulated
by
rule
by
our
arkansas
supreme
court,
though...
or
mandated
by
a
public
policy
from
the
legislature.
the
court
simply
says
we
do
this
and
doesn't
outline
for
us
the
practice
in
which
or
the
procedure
in
which
they
do
conduct
this
review
independently
and
on
their
own.
there
is
nothing
to
ensure,
even
if
he
had
not
taken
a
direct
appeal
that,
when
they
contrasted
the
proportionality
review
with
jonas
whitmore,
that
they
would
include
the
crimes
involving
ronald
gene
simmons.
we
do
know,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
when
he
did
take
it
to
direct
appeal
they
contrasted
him
by
stated
public
opinion
against
people
who
were
guilty
of
similar
types
of
crimes,
robbery
and
murder.
not
those
involved
in
crimes
in
which
he
took
the
deaths
of
16
individuals,
which
took
place
over
a
24
or
48-hour
period.
so,
our
supreme
court
at
least
has
given
us
some
insight
to
say
they
contrast
people
on
death
row
with
similar
type
crimes,
although
there
is
not
an
articulated
procedure.
thirdly,
i
would
say
to
this
court,
if
there
is
some
troublesome
issue
to
this
court
concerning
waiver,
i
submit
to
you
that
there
has
been
a
clearly
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
and
that
the
standard
is
actually
higher
than
that
in
arkansas,
which
is
additional
safeguards
in
the
application
of
the
penalty
of
death.
please
understand
that
after
simmons
i
was
decided
and
mr.
simmons
said,
"i
want
to
die",
his
case
did
go
forward
to
the
arkansas
supreme
court,
advanced
by
father
franz
as
next
friend,
and
the
arkansas
supreme
court
found
no
standing.
and,
in
fact,
that
case
went
forward
on
habeas
to
the
united
states
district
court,
eastern
district
of
arkansas,
and
judge
isley
found
no
standing.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
on
appeal
to
the
eighth
circuit.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
it
is.
it's
on
appeal
to
the
eighth
circuit.
being
stayed,
waiting
the
decision
of
the
court
in
this
case.
but
in
the
issuance
of
waiver,
when
the
first
decision
was
made
in
simmons,
the
arkansas
supreme
court
articulated
a
new
rule.
it
said
in
the
instance
of
waiving
the
right
of
appeal...
and
the
right
of
appeal
is
automatic
in
arkansas
and
if
ronald
gene
simmons
changed
his
mind
this
very
day,
appeal
would
move
forward.
if
he
changed
his
mind
the
hour
before
his
execution,
an
appeal
would
move
forward.
but
it
said...
you
know,
it's
not
just
knowing
an
intelligent
waiver
that's
enough.
it
must
also
be
the
appreciation
of
the
difference
between
life
and
death.
so,
in
simmons
ii
it
was
a
two-pronged
standard
that
was
applied.
and
to
ask
whether
mr.
simmons
actually
knowingly
and
intelligently
waived,
the
transcript
of
the
record
indicates
his
trial
counsel
pointed
out
seven
issues
for
which
he
could
potentially
be
successful
on
appeal.
each
one
separately,
distinctly
given
to
him.
he
answered
he
was
willing
to
waive.
in
the
conclusion
of
that
evidence,
which
included
speedy
trial,
double
jeopardy,
suppression
of
a
search,
separation...
severance
of
trials,
court-appointed
counsel
versus
retained
counsel,
a
whole
series
of--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--he
said,
"i
want
to
waive".
i
understand--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor.
he
has
simply
said
at
the
conclusion
of
both
of
his
two
trials,
"i
am
willing
to
accept
the
verdict.
"
"i
believe
in
the
penalty
of
death.
"
"i
think
it
is
just
and
proper
in
my
case,
and
i
ask
no
one,
no
one,
to
come
forward
to
try
to
intervene,
delay
or
stop
this
process.
"
mr.
j.
steven
clark
he
has
indicated
in
letters
that
are
not
a
part
of
the
record,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--yes,
your
honor,
he
did.
he
describes
mr.
whitmore
and
others
as
interlopers
in
a
decision
that
he
has
a
right
to
make.
he
is
not,
in
that
brief
and
in
other
documents
we've
seen
before
that
he
has
published,
that
he
indicates
that
he
is
not
pleased
that
anyone
is
trying
to
frustrate
this
process
for
him.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
your
honor,
he
has
read
the
briefs.
in
the
instance
of
the
seven
issues,
though,
that
were
brought
to
mr.
simmons'
attention
in
simmons
ii,
the
case
at
bar,
the
trial
judge
even
went
further
than
his
own
counsel,
and
his
own
counsel
did
have
affidavit
of
record
saying
they
had
encouraged
him
repeatedly
to
appeal.
the
trial
counsel
said,
"please,
mr.
simmons,
understand
so
i
know
that
you're
making
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver...
please
understand,
all
you
have
to
do
is
decide
one
of
these
issues
is
worthy
of
appeal
and
your
sentence
of
death
will
be
stayed
for
weeks
or
months
or
years,
or
perhaps
longer
than
the
lives
of
all
of
us
collectively
in
this
courtroom.
"
and
he
said,
"i
understand
that.
"
"i
waive.
"
and
then
he
simply
said
to
him,
"mr.
simmons,
understand,
the
state
is
sincere
about
this...
the
implementation
of
this
penalty
of
death.
"
"if
you
waive
and
do
not
appeal,
you
will
die.
"
he
accepted
all
of
that.
and
so
there
is
clearly
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
in
this
instance.
so
this
case,
i
think,
fails
from
the
petitioner's
standpoint
for
several
reasons.
but
the
first
and
most
important
is
he
has
no
standing.
jonas
whitmore
has
no
right
to
be
here
in
this
courtroom
today
because
he
has
no
standing.
he's
advanced
no
issue
of
a
legally
protected
interest
that
needs
to
be
guarded
by
this
court.
but,
secondly,
even
if
he
did,
the
death
penalty
procedures
in
arkansas
don't
violate
the
eighth
amendment.
clearly,
they
rise
to
a
level
to
afford
the
protection
to
ensure
there
is
no
arbitrary,
capricious
or
freakish
application
of
this
penalty
in
our
state.
and
so
i
submit
to
you
for
all
those
reasons
that
this
court
should
affirm
the
decision
of
the
arkansas
supreme
court.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
sir,
justice
stevens.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
no,
your
honor,
i
think
not.
i
think
in
the
instance
of
this
third
person
that
you've
used
as
the
hypothetical,
who
really
is
quite
similar
to
jonas
whitmore...
the
only
similarity
between
ronald
gene
simmons
and
jonas
whitmore
is
they
both
are
death
row
inmates
and
reside
in
the
state
of
arkansas.
that
if
he
said,
well,
he's
been
denied
a
fundamental
safeguard
in
the
process,
he's
been
kept
in
a
dungeon,
i
don't
think
that
third
person
has
the
standing
that
this
court
requires
to
create
a
case
of
controversy.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
in
your
hypothetical,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
i
think
no.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
justice
white,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no
also.
the
fact
that
a
public
defender
would
like
to
speak
to
this
death
row
inmate
who
desires
to
die,
who
has
knowingly
and
intelligently
waived
his
right
to
appeal--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
well,--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--in
the
instance...
if,
in
your
hypothetical
the
defendant
is
sentenced
to
die
and
has
decided
to
accept
that
sentence
and
done
so
knowingly
and
intelligently
and
waived
such
and
with
the
standard
of
arkansas
with
the
appreciation
between
life
and
death,
though
represented
by
a
public
defender
through
the
entire
process,
and
then
the
public
defender
shows
up
to
the
department
of
corrections
and
finds
he's
in
the
hole,
if
you
will,
and
is
not
permitted
to
talk
to
him,
i
don't
think
that
public
defender
has
standing
to
raise
this
issue.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
well,
in
the
instance,
your
honor,
i
think
in
terms
of
the
waiver.
i
submit
to
you
that
it's
the
position
of
the
state
of
arkansas,
once
waived,
as
the
case
is
now
with
ronald
gene
simmons,
that's
not
absolute.
that's
not...
it
is
revokable.
he
revoke
that
up
until
the
hour
before
his
execution.
that
revocation,
obviously,
your
honor,
comes
upon
a
knowledge
and
understanding
on
his
own.
i
don't
think
that
constitutionally
is
predicated
on
the
right
to
give
him
particular
access
to
a
public
defender
or
other
counsel.
your
hypothetical
is
distinct
from
the
case
at
bar
because
in
this
instance
mr.
simmons
has
retained
counsel,
and
they
were
to
be
present
the
night
of
his...
what
would
have
been
his
execution
on
march
the
16th...
march
the
15th.
they
were
there
that
night
in
1989
before
this
court
stayed
that
execution.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
justice
stevens,
i--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--i've
asked
myself
that
question
and
there
is
the
potential
that
you
can
create,
certainly
in
hypothetical--
mr.
j.
steven
clark
--and
it
seems
grossly
extreme.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
but
in
the
instances,
i
think
this
court
is
bound
by
that
standing
provision
of
the
constitution.
and
in
this
instance,
this
petitioner
woefully
is
inadequate
in
his
ability
to
rise
to
the
level
to
show
standing.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
he
has
retained
counsel,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
we
knew
in
the
instance
of
the
first
case.
i
can't
tell
you...
it...
assuming
the
practice
is
what
it
was
the
first
time,
justice
kennedy,
in
order
to
ensure
that
retained
counsel
was
at
the
prison
at
the
point
where
the
execution
would
take
place,
my
office
was
prepared
to
drive
counsel
from
their
residence
some
150
miles
to
the
prison
so
they
would
be
there.
in
addition,
there
were
other
safeguards
added
to
ensure...
in
consultation
with
my
governor,
governor
clinton,
that
we
could
ensure
right
up
to
the
last
minute
because
counsel
was
there,
if
he
changed
his
mind
and
had
access
to
his
counsel,
he
could
say,
i
change
my
mind,
and
it
would
stop.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
in
simmons
ii
there
is
no
trial
transcript.
we
would
have
to
stay
the
execution
back
with
the
governor.
we
would
have
to
then
file
petition
for
belated
appeal,
order
the
transcript
and
move
forward
that
way.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
the
reporter's
note.
yes,
justice
kennedy.
the
simmons
ii
trial,
which
involves
the
14
deaths,
is
the
court
reporter's
transcript...
records,
but
not
transcribed.
there
is
in
simmons
ii
the
transcribed
record
of
the
knowing
and
voluntary
waiver
of
the
right
to
appeal.
mr.
j.
steven
clark
i
am
not
disturbed
by
that
at
all,
justice
kennedy.
the
fact
that
i
know
that
in
the
instance
of
the
waiver,
the
knowing
waiver,
that
mr.
simmons
was
given
ample
opportunity
to
discuss
specifically
deficiencies
in
the
state's
case.
he
had
been
given
that
private
consultation
by
his
retained
counsel.
he
had
been
given
that
consultation
advise
once
again
in
a
hearing
conducted
by
the
trial
court.
and
that
was
reviewed
one
more
time
by
the
arkansas
supreme
court,
in
which
specific
points
for
appeal
were
enumerated.
and
he
said,
"i
knowingly
and
intelligently
waive".
that
does
not
trouble
me
whatsoever.
i
think
in
this
instance
that
a
criminal
defendant
in
the
process
who
can
make
a
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver,
and
with
the
additional
standard
from
arkansas
with
the
appreciation
of
the
difference
between
life
and
death,
can
take
that
action.
i
ask--
