mr.
richard
p.
weishaupt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
admittedly--
mr.
richard
p.
weishaupt
--thank
you.
the
question
in
this
case
is
simply
whether
the
admittedly
disparate
treatment
afforded
children
is
consistent
with
the
language
passed
by
congress.
congress,
as
mr.
kneedler
correctly
pointed
out,
required
that
children
were
to
be
treated
in
such
a
way
that
if
they
had
an
impairment
or
combination
of
impairments
of
comparable
severity
to
that
which
would
disable
an
adult,
then
they
would
be
found
disabled.
it
is
our
belief,
and
it
is
adequate...
amply
supported
by
the
record,
that
that
is
simply
not
the
case,
that
the
secretary
frequently
has
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
dealing
with
children
who
have
impairments
that
combine
a
number
of
different
factors,
or
that
are
not
on
the
list...
on
the
very
short
list
that
the
secretary
has.
mr.
richard
p.
weishaupt
yes.
mr.
richard
p.
weishaupt
the
secretary's
interpretation,
as
promulgated
by
ruling
83-19,
which
is
the
only
thing
on
paper
that
addresses
the
question
of
equivalence,
quite
simply
states
that
functional
consequences
are
not
to
be
determined.
to
quote
briefly
from
that
ruling,
at
joint
appendix
page
240,
"the
functional
consequences
of
impairments,
irrespective
of
their
nature
or
extent,
cannot
justify
a
determination
of
equivalence.
"
and
that,
quite
frankly,
is
at
the
heart
of
this
case.
the
secretary
does
not
have
an
adequate
means
with
which
to
address
the
difficult
cases.
yes,
it
is
true
that
many
retarded
children
do
quality
for
disability
benefits
because
their
retardation
meets
the
listing.
but
the
problem
is
those
children
who
have
a
combination
of
impairments,
or
who
have
a
rare
disease,
that
simply
does
not
come
on
the
listing
or
that
have
an
atypical
amount
of
functional
loss.
the
secretary's
argument
seems
to
be,
at
least
insofar
as
the
listings
incorporate
function,
it
seems
to
be
that
the
listings
represent
the
secretary's
estimate
of
the
typical
impact
of
an
impairment
upon
the
typical
case.
but
that
is
not
the
way
that
the
social
security
act
is
supposed
to
function.
the
social
security
act
is
supposed
to
function
in
order
to
make
case-by-case
determinations
of
each
individual,
not
only
looking
at
that
child
as
an
individual
and
matching
his
findings
up
with
the
listings,
but
also
to
determine
how
those
impairments
actually
affect
that
particular
child,
what
that
child
can
do
and
what
that
child
cannot
do.
i
think
a
good
illustration
of
the
problems
that
the
secretary
has
with
more
rare
diseases
is
found
in
the
wilkinson
case,
which
is...
which
is
cited
in
both
our
briefs.
in
that
case
the
child
there
suffered
from
a
rare
liver
disorder
that
meant
that
he
swelled
up
at
night,
that
he
ran
fevers
three
or
four
times
a
week,
that
he
constantly
cried,
he
couldn't
leave
the
house;
he
was
allergic
to
all
standard
food.
but
the,
that
particular
rare
liver
disease
was
not
on
the
listing.
he
was
also,
as
a
result
of
the
toxic
chemicals
that
were
thrown
off
by
his
liver,
slightly
retarded.
the
secretary's
defense
of
that
case
was
that
the
closest
listing
was
the
mental
retardation
listing,
and
since
his
retardation
didn't
yield
him
an
iq
of
under
69,
that
he
simply
was
not
disabled.
there
is
no
doubt
that
an
adult
in
that
case
would
get
a
very
different
examination.
mr.
richard
p.
weishaupt
that
would
go
a
long
way
toward
resolving
the
problems
that
we
have
with
the
secretary's
approach.
the
remaining
problem
would
be
that
the
listings
for
children
are
modeled
to
reflect
exactly
the
same
degree
of
impairment
that
is
used
for
adults,
in
that
process
that
is
used
for
adults.
the
problem
with
that
is
that
for...
the
listings
do
not
represent
the
inability
to
perform
substantial
gainful
activity,
they
represent
a
much
higher
cut,
a
cut
that
allows
the
secretary
to
make
presumptive
determinations
for
the
people
who
are
so
impaired
that
there
is
just
no
question
that
they
can't
perform
substantial
gainful
activity.
in
fact,
the
secretary,
with
an
express
delegation
of
authority
from
congress,
has
set
the
listings
at
the
level
that
is
used
for
determining
disability
among
disabled
widows.
disabled
widows
are
found
to
be
disabled
if
they
cannot
perform
any
gainful
activity,
which,
according
to
the
legislative
history
of
that
provision,
is
to
be
a
much
more
stringent
test
than
the
test
used
for
workers
both
in
the
title
ii
program,
and
in
the
ssi
title
xvi
program
that
was
modeled
on
that
title
ii
program.
a
number
of
courts,
including
the
court
in
willowford
v.
harris,
have
criticized
the
mechanical
results
that
sometimes
occur
from
using
a
listings-only
approach
for
widows.
but
whatever
may
be
the
shortcomings
of
that
approach
for
widows,
congress
clearly
did
not
say
that
children
shall
be
found
disabled
if
they
have
an
impairment
of
comparable
severity
to
that
which
would
render
a
widow
disabled
under
the
standard
in
the
act.
and
those
were
the
two
standards
of
disability
that
were
in
the
act
at
the
time
of
original
passage.
on
the
one
hand
you
had
the
inability
to
engage
in
substantial
gainful
activity,
which
was
the
test
for
workers,
and
then
there
was
also
the
test
for
disabled
widows,
which
was
the
inability
to
perform
any
gainful
activity
under
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary
to
so
determine.
congress
meant
to
help
children.
all
of
the
brief
legislative
history
of
the
original
ssi
act
showed
that
there
was
grave
concern
for
what
congress
called
among
the
most
disadvantaged
of
young
children...
of
all
americans.
and
the
secretary's
approach
of
conflating
the
process
for
children
and
adults...
i
am
sorry,
for
children
and
disabled
widows,
into
one
test,
which
is
seen
throughout
his
regulations
and
clarifying
rulings,
is
simply
inconsistent
with
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
kneedler
made
the
suggestion
that
many
of
the
adults
who
qualify
at
step
5
do
so
because
they
have
adverse
vocational
factors:
they
are
approaching
advanced
age,
they
are
poorly
educated.
that
is
true.
however,
20,
fully
25
percent
of
all
the
qualifying
adults,
according
to
the
secretary's
figures,
quality
because
they...
at
that
step
5,
because
they
have
either
a
medical
or
a
medical/vocational
set
of
problems
that
renders
them
disabled.
it
is
very
clear
from
the
secretary's
regulations
and
the
cases
in
this
court,
that
a
person
with
no
adverse
vocational
factors,
a
young
person,
well
educated,
with
job
training,
could
quality
as
disabled
even
if
he
or
she
did
not
meet
the
listings.
that
is
what
the
city
of
new
york
case
was
all
about,
where
apparently
there
was
some
subregulatory
documents
that
gave
the
impression
that
if
a
younger
worker
had
a
mental
impairment
that
left
him
extremely
disturbed,
but
he
did
not
meet
all
of
the
criteria
of
the
listing,
social
security
was
assuming
that
the
fact
that
he
didn't
meet
the
listing
meant
that
he
must
therefore
be
able
to
perform
substantial
gainful
activity.
that
position
was
renounced
by
the
secretary
after
being
criticized
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals.
and
in
this
court,
the
secretary
only
addressed
himself
to
the
question
of
remedy.
mr.
richard
p.
weishaupt
yes,
but
the
secretary
does
not
take
a
functional
approach.
rather,
he
takes
a...
an
approach
that
compares
the
child's
listings
to
one...
problems
to
one
of
57
listings.
mr.
richard
p.
weishaupt
i
think
by
looking
carefully
at
the
wording
that
actually
exists
in
ruling
83-19,
which
states
that
functional
impairments
cannot
be
looked
at
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
that
someone
has
a
impairment
that
rises
to
listing
level,
which
in
and
of
itself
is
a
more
difficult
test
than
an
adult
would
ever
be
put
through.
but
even
putting
that
aside,
justice
scalia,
the
secretary
does
not
allow
a
child
with
atypical
symptomatology
to
show
that
even
though
he
doesn't
meet
a,
b
and
c,
that
his
impairments
are
so
severe
in
a
and
b
that
he
should
be
found
to
be
disabled.
that
is
why
we
find
the
secretary's
practice
of
awarding
benefits
on
children's
eighteenth
birthday,
because
when
they
reach
18,
then
they
can
be
looked
at
with
a...
in
a
holistic
functional
approach,
and
then
they
can
be
awarded
benefits.
mr.
richard
p.
weishaupt
the
secretary
will
allow
an
equivalence
finding
to
be
made
in
the
circumstances
where
a
child
has
a
combination
of
impairments
that
together
yield
the
signs,
symptoms
and
laboratory
data
that
are
necessary
to
meet
one
of
the
listings.
so,
in
other
words,
if
the
child
with
the
rare
liver
disorder
also
had
an
iq
of
69
or
below,
yes,
he
would
be
found
to
meet
the
listings.
and
if...
and
he
would
be
found
to
meet
the
listings.
however,
in
a
situation
where
the...
where
the
combination
of
impairments
can't
provide
the
kind
of
test
scores
that
are
necessary
because
they
are
so
disparate...
we
cite...
one
of
the
amici
cites
in
their
brief,
a
child
with
severe
hypertension,
asthma
and
obesity,
and
there
is
just
no
link
up
of,
in
terms
of
the
symptoms.
each
set
of
symptoms
is
distinct,
and
they
don't
cross
over
into
other
listings.
that
child
has
no
where
to
turn,
because
the
secretary
clearly
states
in
that
ruling,
83-19,
that
it
is
forbidden
to
make
an
overall
assessment
of
function
and
try
to
figure
out
what
level
of
function
is
suggested
by
a
listing
and--
mr.
richard
p.
weishaupt
--no,
although
the
brief
of
the
ama
and
the
american
academy--
mr.
richard
p.
weishaupt
--no,
it
relies
on
their
knowledge
to
state
that
children
frequently
suffer
from
a
wider
array
of
disabilities,
and
frequently
have
more
combinations.
however,
the
class
of
children,
if
you
will,
who
suffer
from
that
wide
array
is
probably
not
large
in
absolute
terms,
but
it
is
significant
for
those
children
who
are
denied
ssi
benefits.
the
ssi
children's
program
only
awards
benefits
to
a
quarter
of
a
million
children,
and
approximately
100,000
claims
are
made
each
year,
50,000
of
which
are
turned
down,
and
50,000
of
which
are
granted.
of
that
50,000
that
are
turned
down,
some
number,
the
record
does
not
reflect
what,
of
those
children
suffer
from
a
combination
of
impairments,
like
the
cases
cited
in
the
amicus
briefs,
that
defy
evaluation
under
the
secretary's
approach.
for
many
children
the
listings
approach
works
adequately.
but
it
is
those
children
who
don't,
who
need
a
case
by
case
adjudication,
for
which
we
claim
that
it
is
important
for
the
secretary
to
have
a
system
with
the
flexibility
to
provide
that,
just
as
he
has
a
system
to
provide
that
kind
of
flexibility
for
adults.
mr.
richard
p.
weishaupt
no,
although
joseph
love
suffered
from
a
combination
of
mental
retardation
and
emotional
disorders,
failed
third
grade
three
times,
eventually
was
found
to
be
so
disturbed
that
he
could
not
even
be
in
a
classroom
with
other
emotionally
disturbed
children.
he
was
found
not
to
be
disabled
because
one
of
the
criteria
in
the
secretary's
mental
health
listings
for
children
looks
at
self-care
skills.
and
since
joseph
helped
his
mother
with
the
dishes
once
in
a
while,
that
was
found
to
be
adequate
self-care
skills
so
that
he
didn't
rise
to
that
level.
but
the
fact
that
he
couldn't
even
achieve
an
education
in
a
forum
particularly
designed
for
his
particular
needs
was
irrelevance
under
the
secretary's
formula.
we
are
not
saying
that
all
of
these
determinations
are
easy,
but
that
is
why
the
secretary
is
delegated
authority
to
make
individualized
determinations.
and
we
submit
that
as
long
as
the
standard
is
one
of
comparable
severity,
that
he
can't
do
it
in
a
way
that
is
so
markedly
different
and
markedly
inferior
from
that
for
adults.
mr.
richard
p.
weishaupt
yes,
but
it
is
only
used
in
that
case
to
deny.
what
was
not
done
was
to
determine
whether
there
were
other
functional
deficits
in
other
areas
that
were
significant
enough
to
outweigh
the
fact
that
he
could
do
the
dishes,
even
though
he
couldn't
even
interact
with
other
children.
so,
when...
and
in
fact,
joseph
love
was
subsequently
found
to
be
disabled,
when
his
symptoms
dipped,
although
there
is
still
a
question
of
that
period
when
he
was
helping
his
mother
wash
the
dishes,
whether
he
was
disabled.
so
what
we
are
saying
is
that
we...
the
secretary
violates
the
statute
by
not
being
able
to
allow
his
adjudicators
to
look
at
overall
function.
not
necessarily
that
looking
at
function
is
automatically
going
to
qualify
someone
as
disabled,
but
rather
that
one
needs
to
look
at
the
overall
function,
just
as
one
does
for
adults,
to
avoid
mechanical
results.
to
avoid
assuming
that
because
the
typical
effects
of
a
particular
impairment
are
as
they
are
in
the
listings,
that
they
may
not
actually
take
place
or
affect
an
individual
in
quite
that
typical
way.
that
a
child
may
not
respond
to
medicine
the
same
way
that
another
child
does,
that
he
may
experience
pain,
that
he
may
have
a
whole
plethora
of
functional
problems
that
are
fair
game
for
adults
to
attempt
to
use
to
show
that
they
are
disabled.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
will
conclude
my
remarks.
thank
you.
