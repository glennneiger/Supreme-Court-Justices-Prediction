justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
case
is
here
from
the
third
circuit,
concerns
supplemental
security
income
benefits
for
children.
the
social
security
act
authorizes
this
for
a
child
who
suffers
from
an
impairment
of
“comparable
severity”
to
one
that
would
render
an
adult
disabled.
an
adult
is
disabled
if
he
is
prevented
from
engaging
in
any
substantial
gainful
activity.
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
has
created
a
five-step
test
to
determine
adult
disability
that
the
third
step,
a
claimant
may
be
found
to
be
disabled
if
medical
evidence
matches
or
is
equal
to
anyone
of
at
number
of
listed
impairments.
if
this
does
not
work
for
the
adult
claimant,
he
still
may
qualify
at
the
fourth
and
fifth
steps.
in
contrast,
the
secretary’s
test
for
a
child
claimant
ends
with
what
he
equates
to
the
adult’s
third
step.
the
respondent
child
here
was
denied
benefits
and
brought
a
class
action
challenging
the
child
disability
regulations.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
secretary.
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
that
judgment
for
it
found
the
regulatory
scheme
inconsistent
with
the
act.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
agree
that
the
child
disability
regulations
are
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
statement
of
comparable
severity
and
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
judgment.
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
and
is
joined
therein
by
the
chief
justice.
