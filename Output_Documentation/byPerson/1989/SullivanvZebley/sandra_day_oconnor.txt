mr.
kneedler--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--isn't
a
functional
evaluation
often
a
necessary
predicate
to
making
a
medical
diagnosis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
it
makes
it
to
the
list.
but,
i
guess
you
would
acknowledge
that
there
are
children
with
impairments
that
aren't
on
any
of
the
secretary's
lists.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if...
if
it
were
an
adult
being
considered
for
disability
benefits,
steps
4
and
5
of
the
evaluation
appear
to
catch
some
severe
impairments
that
aren't
on
the
listings
for
adults.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
understand,
but
would
you
agree
with
me
that
those
steps,
for
adults,
appear
to
pick
up
some
people
who
aren't
on
the
lists?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
is
it
that
the
secretary
has
done,
beyond
part
b
listing,
to
ensure
that
children's
impairments,
of
comparable
severity
to
an
adult,
are
handled
properly?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it
sounds
like
all
the
secretary
has
done
is
to
make
the
part
b
listing,
which
admittedly
doesn't
include
some
major
diseases,
as
i
understand
it,
things
like
down
syndrome
and
cystic
fibrosis
and
heaven
knows
what
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kneedler,
the
respondents
say
that
the
secretary
has
interpreted
regulation
83-19,
or
applied
it,
in
such
a
way
that
it
just
doesn't
consider
functional
impairment.
and
i
understood
from
your
brief
the
secretary
is
considering
changing
it
or
clarifying
it
or
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
indicates
to
me
maybe
there
is
a
problem
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
mr.
weishaupt,
the...
mr.
kneedler
says
that
the
equivalence
determination
takes
care
of
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
think
you
better
address
yourself
to
that,
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
that
the
equivalence
determination
allows
consideration
of
the
functional
impact
of
even
multiple
conditions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
the
secretary
took
out
the
language
there,
in
that
regulation
83-19,
so
that
a
medical...
a
medical
equivalency
determination
also
looked
to
functional
impairment,
would
there
be
anything
left
of
your
case?
