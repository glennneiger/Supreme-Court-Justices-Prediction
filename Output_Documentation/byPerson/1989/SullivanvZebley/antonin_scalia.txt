mr.
kneedler,
i...
this...
this
exchange
is
bringing
out
what
has
puzzled
me.
you
say
it
is
an
impairment
comparable
to
one
that
would
render
an
adult
disabled.
but
what
you
have
just
demonstrated
is
that
that
is
not
an
absolute.
it
depends
on
the
adult.
which
adult
are
you
using
for
your
comparability
analysis
here?
an
adult
who
has
a
lot
of
skills,
or
an
adult
who
has
little
skills?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
using
a
middle
aged
adult
as
your
standard,
or
an
elderly
adult?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that
statement
you
have
just
quoted?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
so
that
may
show
that
other
people
are
misinterpreting
the
regulation
as
well,
but
i
suppose
it
shows,
at
least,
the
secretary
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
the
secretary
explains
that,
counsel,
by
saying
that
for
an
adult
like
that,
a
young
adult
like
that,
the
statute
provides
a
clear
criterion:
the
ability
to
work.
it
provides
no
such
criterion
for
a
child.
and
therefore
you
have
to
resort,
the
secretary
says,
to
comparable
severity,
which
is
what
the
statute
says,
which
in
turn
forces
you
to
look
to
particular
functional
disabilities
and
see
if
the
child
has
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
how
we
resolve
that.
you
say
he
doesn't,
and
he
say...
he
says
he
does,
and
points
to
language
that...
obviously
allows
them
to
use
functional
considerations.
how
are
we
to
resolve
that
dispute?
justice
antonin
scalia
once
again,
there
is
just
a
flat
disagreement
as
to
what...
i
guess
what
the
fact
is
on
that.
mr.
kneedler
has
just
told
us
quite
the
opposite
of
what
you
said.
that
if
the
child
has
a,
b...
a,
b
and
c,
no
single
one
of
which
rises
to
the
proper
level,
the
combination
of
the
three
nonetheless,
on
the
basis
of
the
functional
results
of
the
three,
would
suffice.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
the
regulation...
mr.
kneedler,
you
are
treating
this
as
though
the
question
whether
a
regulation
can
be
stricken
on
its
face
is
the
same
as
whether
a
law
can
be
stricken
on
its
face
as
unconstitutional,
and
the
test
there
is
whether
in
any
of
its
applications
it
could
be
constitutional.
surely
the
test
for
regulation
is
not
whether
in
any
of
its
applications
it
can
be
valid.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
valid
in
all
of
its
applications
as
written,
at
least.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
it
has
to
be,
at
least
theoretically...
on
its
face
it
must
theoretically
be
able
to
lead
to
the
right
result
in
all
cases,
isn't
that
right?
