mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals,
in
this
nationwide
class
action,
invalidated
the
central
regulatory
requirement
that
has
governed
eligibility
for
children's
disability
benefits
since
the
outset
of
the
supplemental
security
income
program
in
1974.
the
regulation
at
issue
provides
that
in
order
to
qualify
for
benefits
a
child
must
have
an
impairment
or
a
combination
of
impairments
that
is
included
in
the
listing
of
impairments
in
the
regulations,
or
is
equal
in
severity
to
a
listed
impairment.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
for
four
reasons
in
invalidating
these
regulations
on
their
face.
first,
the
regulation
respondents
challenge
is
supported
in
a
number
of
respects
by
the
text
and
legislative
nistory
of
the
definition
of
disability
in
title
xvi.
second,
the
regulation
requiring
that
a
children's
impairment
meet
or
equal
a
listed
impairment
was
adopted
in
1974
at
the
outset
of
the
ssi
program.
it
therefore
represents
a
contemporaneous
interpretation
of
the
act
by
those
charged
with
its
initial
implementation,
and
a
consistent
and
long-standing
interpretation
of
the
act
as
well.
third,
congress
ratified
this
regulatory
requirement
that
respondents
challenge
in
1976,
soon
after
the
ssi
program
got
underway.
specifically,
in
the
1976
unemployment
compensation
amendments,
congress
directed
the
secretary
to
publish
the
objective
criteria
that
he
was
then
developing
internally
to
implement
the
regulation,
and
to
use
those
criteria
to
determine
disability.
and
the
special
part
b
listing
of
impairments
utilized
for
children
were
issued
the
following
year,
pursuant
to
that
statutory
directive
and
special
delegation
of
legislative
rule-making
authority.
and
fourth,
the
secretary's
regulatory
approach
adheres
to
the
functional
orientation
of
the
social
security
disability
programs.
the
part
a
listing,
which
children
can
also
qualify
under,
is
principally
applicable,
or
was
designed
for
adults,
and
it
identifies
those
impairments
which
the
secretary
has
determined
would
render
an
adult
unable
to
work,
which
is
itself
obviously
a
functional
predicate
for
the
listing.
the
part
b
listing
has
the
same
thrust.
in
1974,
in
fleshing
out
the
statutory
standard
of
comparable
severity,
the
secretary,
after
a
two
year
study
in
the
initial
implementation
of
the
ssi
child's
program,
with
the
aid
of
physicians
and
other
experts,
identified
those
impairments
that
have
an
impact
on
a
child's
growth
and
development
that
is
comparable
to
the
effect
that
an
impairment
has
on
an
adult's
ability
to
work.
therefore,
the
part
b
listing
carries
forward
the
functional
orientation
of
the
act.
furthermore,
some
of
the
specific
listings
under
part
b
require
a
further
and
explicit
consideration
of
functional
aspects.
for
example,
and
of
particular
relevance
in
this
case,
is...
are
the
mental
impairment
listings.
for
example,
the
mental
retardation,
under
which
respondent
zebley
and
respondent
raushi
were
evaluated,
specifically
provides
for
consideration
of
functional
aspects.
i
call
the
court's
attention
in
this
respect
to
page
233
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
the
mental
retardation
listing
is
included.
i
am
informed
by
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
that
40
percent
of
the
children
who
are
found
disabled
are
found
disabled
because
of
mental
retardation.
and
listing
12...
112.05
identifies
the
qualifying
standards
as,
in
the
alternative,
achievement
of
only
those
developmental
milestones
generally
acquired
by
children
no
more
than
one-half
the
child's
chronological
age,
and
iq
of
59
or
less,
or
an
iq
of
60
to
69,
inclusive,
and
in
addition
a
physical
or
other
mental
impairment
imposing
additional
and
significant
restriction
of
function
or
developmental
progression.
this
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
page.
so,
it
seems
to
us
particularly
odd
in
this
case
that
the
claim
would
be
leveled
that
the
special
part
b
listing
is
not
faithful
to
the
functional
orientation
of
the
act,
both
because
functional
standards
are
imbedded
in
the
listings
themselves,
as
the
secretary
specifically
announced
when
the
part
b
listing
was
adopted
in
1976,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
the
way
in
which
this
program
is
implemented,
in
fact,
provides
for
a
functional
assessment
in
many
circumstances.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there
may
be...
there
may
be
children
who
aren't
on
the
list,
but
that
doesn't...
i
mean,
there
are
two
points
about
that.
one
is,
of
the...
if
the
impair...
if
the
specific
impairment
is
not
listed,
if
the
specific
criteria
for
the
impairment
are
not
listed,
the
child
can
still
establish
that
he
meets
the
level
of
severity
set
forth
in
the
listings
by
showing
that
he...
that
his
particular
impairment
equals
a
listed
impairment.
and
in
determining
that,
in
matching
something
to
the
listings,
what
the
decision-maker
has
to
do
is
look
for
the
medical
signs
and
findings
and
symptoms
of
the
impairment.
one
of
those
findings
are
functional,
would
be
the
functional
limitation
imposed
on
the
child
as
a
result
of
his
impairment.
if
those
functional
limitations
match
the
level
of
severity
in
the
listing,
he
will
be
found
eligible.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
principal
thrust
of
steps
4
and
5,
step
4
is
if
the
person
can
do
his
past
work
he
is
not
disabled,
and
that
would...
we'll
put
that
to
one
side.
but
step
5,
what
step
5
provides
for
is
the
determination
of
whether
the
individual
can
do
other
work
that
exists
in
the
national
economy,
taking
into
account
his
residual
functional
capacity
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
may
pick
up
some
people,
but
this
gets
to
the
point
i
was
going
to
make.
the
reason
that
a...
that
an
adult
would
be
found
disabled
at
step
5
would
typically
be,
not
because
of
the
severity
of
his
impairment
standing
alone,
but
because
he,
in
addition,
has
an
adverse
non-medical
factor,
a...
an
adverse
vocational
factor.
he
is
of
advanced
age,
he
is
of
poor
education
or
he
has
poor
job
training.
congress
specifically
provided,
in
paragraph
(b)
of
the
statutory
provision
here,
for
those
vocational
factors
to
be
considered
in
the
case
of
an
adult.
it
did
not
include
a
similar
list
of
non-medical
factors
for
children.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
what
the...
what
the...
it
is
the
part
b
listing--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
to
that,
justice
o'connor,
i...
the
respondents
and
some
of
the
amici,
i
think,
have
a
misapprehension
about
the
way
the
listing
works.
the
listing
is
not
a
listing
of
diseases.
it
is
a
listing
of
mental
and
physical
impairments.
the
statutory
term
is
mental
and
physical
impairment.
and
what
the
listings
do
is
go
body
system
by
body
system
and
identify
impairments
to
the
body
system.
for
example,
the
ability
to
move
a
limb,
or
the...
or
mental
impairments,
cognitive
or
emotional,
or
other...
other
disorders.
what
the
listings
do
is
identify
impairments
in
the
body
system.
any
one
impairment
might
be
due
to
a
variety
of
different
diseases.
for
example,
down
syndrome,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
down
syndrome
children
are
typically
quite
mentally
retarded,
and
the
experience,
as
we
point
out
in
our
supplemental
brief,
with
down
syndrome
is
most
down
syndrome
children
are
found
disabled
because
they
meet
the
mental
retardation
listing.
and
if
the
down
syndrome
child
would
have
other
disorders
associated
with
that,
such
as
a
digestive
problem
or
something
of
that
sort,
then
you
would
look
to
that
body
system
listing
to
see
whether
the
effect
of
the
impairment
on
that
body
system
renders
him
disabled.
so,
the
fact
that
a
particular
disease
is
not
listed
as
such
under
the
listings
is
really
beside
the
point.
and
again,
the
statutory
definition
of
disability
for
an
adult
refers
to
an
individual
who
has
a
physical
or
mental
impairment,
that
he
is
unable
to
engage
in
substantial
gainful
activity
by
reason
of
a
physical
or
mental
impairment,
which
is
the
effect
on
the
body's
ability
to
perform,
not
the
medical
diagnosis
of
a
particular
disease.
and
for
children,
i...
in
further
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
for
children
the
statutory
standard
in
the
parenthetical
at
the
end
of
the
statute...
of
the
statutory
definition
of
disability
is
for
a
child
with
a
mental
or
physical
impairment
of
comparable
severity.
in
other
words,
for
adults
the
standard
of
disability
is
defined
in
terms
of...
the
ultimate
question
is
ability
to
work.
is
the
adult
unable
to
perform
substantial
gainful
activity
by
reason
of
his
impairment.
in
other
words,
the
ultimate
question
is
that
by...
unable
to
work
by
reason
of
impairment,
the
disability
to
work.
for
children,
though,
the
statutory
standard
is
the
impairment
of
comparable
severity.
that
phrase
does
not
focus
on
the
end
result
of
whether
the
child
can
work.
the
phrase
comparable
severity
instead
focuses
on
the
severity
of
the
impairment.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is
not
irrelevant
in
terms
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
in
terms
of
measuring,
in
terms
of
ascertaining
what
the
phrase
comparable
severity
means,
what
the
secretary
did
was
to
look
at
what
is
comparable
in
children
to
performing
substantial
gainful
activity
in
adults.
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
in
the
preamble
to
the
'77
regulations,
what
the
secretary
has
explained
is
that
in
children
the
primary
life
activity
isn't
work,
as
it
is
for
adults,
but
it's
development
and
growth.
and
therefore
the
secretary
identified
in
the...
in
the
special
listing
for
children
the
impairments
that
have
an
effect
on
development
and
growth
in
children
that
is
comparable
to
the
effect
on
the
ability
to
perform
substantial
gainful
activity
in
adults.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
for
example,
the
part
a
listing
for
adults
identifies
impairments
that
the
secretary
has
determined
would
render
an
adult
unable
to
work.
and
that
is
itself
a
functional...
even
though...
even
though
the
measurement
of
the
severity
of
the
impairment
could
be
described
as
a
medical
measurement,
and
that
is
the
way
in
which
it's
typically
referred
to,
it
does
take
into
account
functional
impacts.
the
measurement
of
severity,
in
other
words,
is
done
in
terms
of
its
functional
impact.
for
an
adult,
the
ability
to
work.
for
a
child,
the
level
of
severity
is
measured
in
these
other
ways,
in
terms
of
the
child's
ability--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
it...
yes,
i
think
it...
i
hesitate...
yes,
i
think
it
is
misstating
the
issue.
children,
there
is
an
individualized
determination
for
children.
children
are
in
a
position
to
show
that
they
have
an
impairment,
their
own
medical
condition,
based
on
their
individualized
showing
of
what
their
impairment
is,
that
is
included
in
the
listings,
or,
if
not
included
in
the
listings,
that
it
is
equal
in
severity
to
a
listed
impairment.
and
that
is
the
individualized
determination.
what
the
secretary
has
done
in
the
listings,
though,
is
to
say...
the
statutory
phrase
comparable
severity
is
very
general,
and
what
congress...
what
the
secretary
did,
pursuant
to
congressional
authority,
is
to
try
to
give
content
to
that
standard
of
comparable
severity.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
possible,
but...
it's
possible
that
he
might,
but
it
seems...
there
are
two
reasons
for
that.
one
is
that
the
over
18,
the
touchstone
of
the
disability
program
is
ability
to
work,
and
thus
at
age
18
the
decision-maker
would
look
at
the
child's
ability
to
work.
and
in
looking
at
that
question,
not
simply...
not
only
look
at
the
severity
of
the
impairment,
but
other
non-medical,
the
vocational
factors.
a
child,
the
child
may
have
no
significant
education--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
the
impairment
is
the
same,
yes,
but
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
reason,
there
is
comparability
in
the
severity
of
the
impairment.
in
the
hypothetical
you
gave
me,
the
severity
of
the
impairment
is
the
same
in
the
two
examples.
the
statutory
standard
is
comparable
severity,
which,
you
look
at
the
severity
of
the
two
impairments.
for
the
hypothetical
person
you
are
describing,
it
would
often
be
the
case,
i
think,
that
the
reason
the
person
would
become
disabled
at
age
18
is
because
you
then
take
into
account
the
additional
non-medical
factors,
the
vocational
factors.
there
is
age,
education,
and
work
experience.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
well,
what
i
said
was
you
don't
read
it
out
of
the
statute
in
the
sense
that,
in
deciding
what
is
comparable
severity.
the
touchstone
is
comparable
severity
to
an
impairment
that
would
render
an
adult
disabled.
in
the
example
that
you
are
giving,
and
i
think
in
most
of
the
cases
involving
adults
who
are
found
disabled
at
step
5,
it
isn't
the
impairment
alone
that
renders
them
disabled.
it
is
the
impairment
plus
an
adverse
vocational
factor.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
your
question
highlights
the
difficulties
with
respondents
position.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
comparable,
the
touchstone
is
the
part
a
listings,
which
would
render
adults
generally
disabled.
in
other
words,
it
would
render
an
adult
disabled
on
medical
grounds
alone--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--excluding
a
functional
assessment.
the...
an
adult
who
might
be
found
disabled
not
on
the
basis
of
impairment
alone,
but
on
the
basis
of
his
advanced
age
or
inadequate
job
training
or
education,
that
is
not
a
person...
his
impairment...
his
impairment
may
not
be
of
comparable
severity,
would
not
be.
because
the
listings
are
intended
to
match
comparable
severity
of
children's
disability,
or
children's
impairments
and
adults.
it
is
when
you
go
beyond
that,
and
typically
the
adult
would
be
found
disabled
for
some
other
reason.
so
it
is
not...
it
is
not
an
impairment
that
you
could
confidently
conclude
in
that
situation
would
render
an
adult
disabled,
on
the
basis
of
the
impairment
alone.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's...
it's
conceivable.
i
mean,
the
progression...
the
progression
would
contemplate
that
that
should
happen.
but
the
way
the
listings
and
step
5
interact,
step...
the
listings
are
intended
to
identify
those
impairments
that
would
enable
you
to
conclude
that
the
person
is
disabled
solely
because
of
his--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--his
impairment.
the
latter
steps
are
designed
to
factor
in
the
age,
education
and
work
experience.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but,
the
combination
of
the
impairments
can
also
be
considered,
in
fact
is
required
to
be
considered,
at
step
3
of
the
listing
as
well.
in
other
words,
if
a
child
has
two
impairments,
no
one
of
which
meets
or
equals
the
listing
standing
alone,
then
the
decision-maker
has
to
look
at
those
impairments
in
combination
and
look
at
their
effect--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
are...
in
particular,
i
am
referring
to
ssr
83-19,
which
is
included
at
page
239
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
also,
that
interprets
a
regulation,
which
is
cite,
to
the
court,
20
c.f.r.
416.926,
which
is
medical
equivalence.
and
that...
paragraph
a
of
that
regulation
says,
and
this
is
not
in
the
record,
but
it
says
if
you
have
more
than
one
impairment,
and
none
of
them
meets
or
equals
a
listed
impairment,
we
will
review
the
symptoms,
signs
and
laboratory
findings
about
your
impairments
to
determine
whether
the
combination
of
your
impairments
is
medically
equal
to
any
listed
impairment.
so
the
regulation
requires
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
what
that
means
is
medically--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
way
it
works
is
you...
the
ultimate
inquiry
is
whether
the
combination
of
your
impairments
rises
to
the
level
of
severity
of
impairments
set
forth
in
the
listings
in
general
terms--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
what...
if
it
doesn't...
what
the
decision-maker
does
is
look
at
the
combination
of
impairments
and
compare
it
to
the
impairment
that
is
most
similar.
you
look
at
what
expression
of
impairments
predominates,
is
it
mental
retardation
with
maybe
secondary
physical
problems
or
vice
versa.
depending
on
which
one
predominates,
you
look
at
that
listing,
and
then
you
take
into
account
additional
functional
limitations
imposed
by
the
second...
the
additional
or
the
multiple
impairments
and
see
whether
they
rise
to
the
level
of
impairment
severity
set
forth
in
the
listing.
because,
again,
the
statutory
touchstone
is
comparable
severity,
the
severity
of
the
impairment,
not
residual
functional
capacity,
what
the
individual
can
do
despite
his
impairment.
so
the
listings
specifically
do
take
into
account
the
concern
you
are
raising,
of
multiple
impairments.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
clarifying
it.
let
me...
let
me
explain
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think
it
is
a
problem
in
respondents'
misconstruction.
respondents'
allegation
is
not
as
to
the
secretary's
practice.
as
i
understand
their
argument
in
the
citations
in
the
brief,
it
is
entirely
based
on
what
they
perceive
to
be
the
language
of
the
regulation,
which
they
say
precludes
consideration
of
functional
impair...
functional
limitations
resulting
from
an
impairment,
in
deciding
whether
something
equals
the
listings.
the
secretary
does
not
construe
his
own
interpretive
ruling
in
that
way,
and
under
udall
v.
tallman
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
ssr
83-19
is
entitled
to
very
substantial
deference.
and,
after
all,
83-19
is
itself
an
interpretive
ruling
that
interprets
the
regulation,
which
does
provide
for
an
equivalency
determination.
but
beyond
that,
i
mean,
several
factors
point
out
that
respondents
are
incorrect
in
assuming
that
the
secretary
has
read
his
own
regulation
to
bar
consideration
of
functional
impact.
for...
we
discuss
both
these
things
in
the
supplemental
brief
that
we
filed
last
wednesday.
in
the
typescript
version,
in
footnote
6,
we
cite
the...
a
passage
from
the
physicians'
training
manual,
which
is
sent
out
to
the
physicians
in
the
field
who
are
specifically
charged
with
making
a
determination
of
whether
a
child's
impairment
equals
the
listing.
and
this
instruction
pertains
to
adults,
but
the
point
i
am
going
to
make
pertains
to
children
as
well.
it
says
medical
equivalency
permits
a
physician
to
arrive
at
a
judgment
that
the
findings,
although
not
exactly
mis...
matching
the
listed
criteria,
have
the
same
effect
as
a
listed
impairment
with
regard
to
inability
to
perform
work-related
activities.
for
a
child
the
concept
would
be
that,
in
deciding
equivalency,
you
can
see
whether
the
child's
impairment,
although
not
listed,
has
the
same
impact
on
his
ability
to
perform
the
sorts
of
functions
to
which
that
body
system
relates
as
a
listed
impairment.
and
the
other
point
i
would
make,
that
we
also
point
out
in
our
supplemental
brief,
is
that
the...
secretary,
through
ssa,
undertook
a
study
of
the
child's
disability
program
this
year.
and
the
preliminary
results
of
that
study,
requested
by
the
senate
finance
committee
in
its
consideration
of
pending
legislation,
evaluated
and
discovered
certain
areas
where
the
secretary
thought
that
there...
that
there
should
be
additional
attention
to
making
sure
that
adjudicators
are
fully
complying
with
the
listings.
and
one
of
the
areas
in
which
the
study
described
areas
in
the
men...
area
of
mental
impairments,
was
that
as
to
those
that
were
found
not
to
equal
the
listing,
erroneously,
they
were
almost
exclusively
based
on
the
failure
to
consider
how
all
documented
impairments
combined
to
affect
the
child's
overall
functional
capacity.
so
the
secretary,
in
evaluating
decisionmaking
by
lower...
by...
in
the
sample
of
cases
that
were
obtained,
specifically
reaffirmed
the
idea
that
this...
that
the
equivalency
concept
is
not
construed
or
applied.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
this
is
at
page
7
of
the
typescript
version
of
our...
of
our
supplemental
brief,
i
am
sorry,
that
we
filed
on
november
22.
that
quotation--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
error
rate
for
mental
impairments
was
only
10
percent.
now,
one
hopes
that
it
could
be
brought
down
from
that,
but
in
the
review
of
the
cases
the
secretary
determined
that
90
percent
of
the
denials
were
correctly
decided.
now,
it...
i
don't
think
there
is
any
indication
that
adjudicators
generally,
and
respondents
haven't
pointed
to
any,
that
adjudicators
generally
believe
that
functional...
functionally
related
consequences
can't
be
taken
into
account
in
the
equals
area.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
do
have
several
things
i
wanted
to
say.
first
of
all,
this
class
action
was
brought
as
a
facial
challenge
to
the
requirement
that
a
child
show
that
his
impairment
meets
or
equals
the
listing.
as
we
have
shown,
that
requirement
was
established
in
1974,
it
was
ratified
by
congress
in
1976,
and
it
has
been
in
place
ever
since.
particular
disagreements
about
the
way
the
listing
might
be
applied
in
a
particular
case,
and
whether
one
child
should
be
granted
or
denied
under
that...
under
the
listing,
are
simply
not
properly
before
the
court
in
a
class
action.
and,
for
example,
the
particular
way
in
which
the
equivalency
concept
might
be
applied
in
this
case,
or
one
situation
or
another,
is
not
before
the
court.
but
with
reference
to
the
equivalency--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
question...
this
suit
was
brought
to
challenge
the
requirement
that
a
child
must
meet
or
equal
the
listings--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--not
what...
not
what
the
content
of
the
listings
themselves
was.
and
this
is
a
suit
to
challenge
the
meet
or
equals
requirement
which
has
been
in
the
regulations
for
a
long
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we
just
can't
tell
on
this
record,
on
the
basis
of
the
record
of
this,
of
a
hypothetical
member
of
a
class
who
might
have
one
disorder
or
not,
first
of
all
whether
he
would
be
found
disabled.
i
mean,
as
i
have
explained,
if
the
severity
of
his
impairment
is
equal
in
severity
to
one
that
is
listed,
he
would
be
found
disabled.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
i
think
the
parenthetical
is...
explains
what
this
sentence
is
about.
what
the
secretary
is
saying
is
we
don't
decide
children's
cases
on
the
basis
of
the
residual
functional
capacity.
in
other
words,
what
a
child
can
do
despite
his
impairment.
that
is
what
you
do
for
an
adult.
for
an
adult
you
look
at
the
impairment
itself.
it's
really
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
instead
of
looking
at
what
he
still
has
left,
you
look
at
what
has
been
taken
away
from
him
by
virtue
of
his
impairment.
you
match
that
impair...
that
impairment
to
the
listings.
and
in
deciding
whether
the
impairment
is
severe
enough--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--you
match
the
combined
effect
of
the
impairments,
as--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--to
the
one
that
is
most
near,
most
nearly
applicable.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
that
is
not
to
say
that
you
disregard
the
other
aspects,
but
you
check
to
see
whether
the
child's
impairment
has...
whether
his
impairment
has
a
similar
functional
impact
on
him
that
the
listed
impairment
has
on
a
child
who
has
that
impairment.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
at
all.
it
has
to
be...
it
has
to
be
the
content
of
the
regulation
has
to
be,
as
we
have
explained,
manifestly
contrary
to
the
act,
that
the
secretary
can't
even
proceed
in
this
manner.
and
that,
if
the
regulation
is
misapplied
in
a
particular
case,
that
is
not
a
proper
subject
for
a
class
action
lawsuit
such
as
this.
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well
then
a
claimant
who
wants
to
make
that
claim
could
make
that
in
his
own
individual
suit.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
at
all.
and
we're
here--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
and,
for
example,
if
the
court
were
to
conclude,
contrary
to
our
interpretation
and
contrary
to
respondents'
own
best
interests,
that
the
83-19
does
not
allow
for
consideration
of
functional
impact,
the
proper
course
would
be...
would
be
to
invalidate
that
ruling
in
a
proper
case.
as
we
say,
we
don't
think
that's
here,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
as
respondents--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
and
the...
theoretically
it
can
here,
because
the
only
regulatory
requirement
at
issue
is
whether
the
child
can
meet
or
equals...
equal
the
listings.
that
is
theoretically
possible
of
meeting
the
statutory
standard
of
comparable
severity.
if,
in
a
particular
case,
the
listings
themselves
are
inadequately
applied,
then
that
is
something
to
be
taken
up
elsewhere.
but
as
to
the
regulation
being
challenged,
that...
it's
valid
in
all
its
applications.
thank
you.
