so,
under
your
view,
the
phrase,
with
reference
to
adults,
unable
to
engage
in
any
substantial
gainful
activity,
is
just
irrelevant
with
respect
to
the
child?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
reading
it
out
of
the
statute
as
to
the
child?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
under
your
interpretation
that's
a
functional
analysis
that
is
comparable
to
the
functional
analysis
that
you
engage
in
in
determining
substantial
gainful...
substantial
gainful
activity
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
still
not
clear
to
me,
if
you
don't
read
it,
that
phrase,
any
substantial
gainful
activity,
out
of
the
statute,
why
is
it
that
you
require
a
hearing
as
to
an
adult,
or
an
individualized
determination,
whereas
you
don't
with
the
child.
or
is
that
misstating
the
issue?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
there
be
a
case
where
a
17-and-a-half-year-old
could
not
obtain
benefits,
but
then
upon
reaching
18
he
could?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
the
disease...
if
the
disease
and
the
impairment
is
the
same--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--how
is
it
that
at
age
17
and
a
half
you
don't
obtain
the
benefit
and
at
18
plus
you
do?
how...
how
can
you
say
that,
based
on
that
result,
the...
there
is
comparability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
you
said
that
you
have
to
take
that
into
account
anyway,
because
you
are
not
reading
that
out
of
the
statute
as
to
children.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
when
the
secretary
found
that
his
ability
to
help
his
mother
entered
into
the
equation,
isn't
that
the
very
functional
kind
of
analysis
that
you
insist
ought
to
be
made?
