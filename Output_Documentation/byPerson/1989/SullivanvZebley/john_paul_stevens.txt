i
think
i
understand.
mr....
let
me
just
clear
up
one
thing
in
my
mind,
mr.
kneedler.
in
step
5,
in
the
adult
situation,
as
you
describe
it,
you
often
rely
on
non-medical
factors,
that
are...
poor
job
training
or
age
or
something
like
that.
but
is
it
not
possible,
in
step
five
for
adults,
that
the
determination
could
be
based
entirely
on
medical
factors,
none
of
which
itself
was
sufficient
under
the
listings
on...
in
step
3.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
they
also,
it
seems
to
me,
factor
in
the
possibility
that
there
is
a
combination
of
three
or
four
factors,
none
of
which
in
itself
is
sufficient
to
meet
the
standards
on
the
step
3
list.
and
i
am
not
quite
sure
how
you
take
care
of
that
problem
in
the
non-adult
situation,
where
you
have
these
categories,
which
i
see...
12
categories,
or
whatever
they
are,
and
perhaps
the
child
would
not
satisfy
any
one
standard,
but
conceivably
a
combination
of
just
being
short
on
three
or
four
of
them,
would
be
comparable
to
the
step
5
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
regulation,
what
part
of
the
regulation
requires
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
medically
equal
to
any
listed
impairment.
but
see,
my
hypothesis
is
that
none
of
them
would
be
medically
equal
to
the
particular
standard--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--for
the
skeletal
system,
or
the
mental
system,
whatever
it
is.
but
you
nevertheless...
it
seems
to
me...
well,
maybe
i
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
my
hypothesis
is
that
it
wouldn't.
it
wouldn't
meet
any
one
of
the
separate
standards.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
then
follow
that
child
could
never
be
termed
permanently
disabled?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
it
before
the
court,
if
there
are
members
of
the
class
who
would
fit
the
description
of
your
adversary?
why
isn't...
why
isn't
a
class
representative
entitled
to
make
those
arguments?
i'm
not
quite...
i
don't
quite
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
if
there
are
members
of
the
class,
i
gather...
i
don't
have
the
definition
of
the
class
in
front,
it
would
include
this
person
in
the...
wilkinson
case,
or
whatever
it
was
that
he
referred
to,
why
can't
the
argument
be
made
that
that
requirement
is
invalid
as
applied
to
some
members
of
the
class?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
if
it
is
equal
to
one
that
is
listed,
but
looking
at
page
240
of
the
regulation,
where
you
called
our
attention
to
paragraph
3
on
239,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
would
be
people
who
would
have...
it
would
be
people
under
18,
who
would
have
total
disability
but
not
meet
one
of
the
standards.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you
specifically
say
the
functional
consequence
of
the
impairments,
i.e.,
rfc,
irrespective
of
their
nature
or
extent,
cannot
justify
a
determination
of
equivalence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
match
one
of
the
impairments
to
the...
you
match
to
one--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--to
only
one
of
the
listings.
