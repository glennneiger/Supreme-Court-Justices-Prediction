what
were
the
specific
items
that
were
disapproved?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
something
have
to
do
with
labels?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
does
granting
an
exemption
require
anything
to
be
collected?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
you
exempt
it
then
he
doesn't
have
any
obligations.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
nevertheless...
nevertheless,
the
exemption
didn't
require
the
collection
or
reporting
of
any
information.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
said
sorry,
fred,
you
don't
have
to
do
any
of
that
collecting--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
did
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
to
the
extent
it
wasn't
exempt,
i
am
sure
it
imposed
paperwork
requirements.
but
to
the
extent
it
was
exempt,
it
lessened
the
requirement.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
omb,
in
terms
of
carrying
out
its
function
of
reviewing
and
improving
information
collection
requests,
say
by
the
way,
you
haven't
requested
enough
information?
justice
byron
r.
white
and--
justice
byron
r.
white
--including
whether
the
information
will
have
practical
utility
for
the
agency.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
and
yet
this
information
is
given
to
other
people.
justice
byron
r.
white
having
it
disseminated.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
to
its
employees.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it,
omb
here
on
the
exemption
said
they
disapprove
the
exemptions
because
the
exemptions
didn't
go
far
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
you
shouldn't
have
required
all
these
labels
in
certain
areas,
even
if
you
thought
they
should.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
about
all
that
was
in
this
redo
ordered
by
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you
say
these
regulations
were
simply
policy
judgments
by
the
agency.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
omb
shouldn't
have
disagreed
with
them.
why
was
it...
why
was
it...
how
did
it
ever
get
over
to
the
omb?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
scared
to
death?
they
just--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
know,
but
if
you
are
right
they
shouldn't
have
sent
them
over
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
anything
in
there
that
the
omb
had
any
business
passing
on
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
tell
me
about
the
labels.
where
does
that,
where
do
those
fit
in
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
recordkeeping,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they...
osha
determines
that
this
kind
of
a
label
is
necessary
to
safeguard
an
employee.
omb
can
say:
not
required
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
that
is
what
it
said.
it
said
it
doesn't
go
far,
it
doesn't
go
far...
you
should
have
exempted
some
other
labeling
requirements.
