we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-1434,
elizabeth
dole
v.
united
steelworkers
of
america.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
page
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you
now,
mr.
minear?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can't
follow
you.
well,
mr.
minear,
certainly
the
language
though
does
seem
to
speak
in
terms
of
things
furnished
to
an
agency
or
collection
by
an
agency.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
gold.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
do
you
agree
that
omb
is
entitled
to
a
certain
amount
of
deference
in
its
construction
of
the
provisions
of
the
act
that
are
critical
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
true
of
all
agencies.
there
isn't
a
single
agency
that
doesn't
have
limited
jurisdiction
and
not
have
a
limited
function.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gold,
the
government's
petition
phrases
the
question,
the
last
four
lines,
as
whether
the
paperwork
reduction
act's
review
process
applies
to
agency
regulations
developed
as
a
part
of
the
agency's
statutory
mission
that
require
regulated
entities
to
collect
information
for
disclosure
of
third
parties.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that,
that
question
suggests
that
the
actual
arbitrary
and
capricious
review
of
particular
standards
isn't
before
us
now,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
we...
we
were
to
reject
both
of
what
you
call
its
independent
grounds,
that
we
would
say
that
the
pra
as
construed
by
omb
does
cover
furnishing
of
information
of
third
parties,
and
that
it
can
have
something
to
do
with
the
substantive
affairs
of
the
agency.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
still
would
not
mean
that
we
were
holding
omb's
agency,
regulations
on
these
particular
cases,
that
we
were
upholding
them,
would
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gold.
mr.
minear,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
the
case
is
submitted.
