mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
paperwork
reduction
act
requires
omb
to
review
agency
information
collection
requests
to
determine
whether
they
are
necessary
for
the
proper
performance
of
the
agency's
functions.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
review
process
applies
to
the
secretary
of
labor's
hazard
communication
standard,
which
requires
employers
to
compile
and
maintain
chemical
hazard
information
for
disclosure
to
their
employees.
i
would
like
to
being
by
explaining
how
this
issue
has
arisen.
i
will
then
explain
why
the
government
believes
that
the
hazard
communication
standard
is
subject
to
paperwork
review.
the
secretary
first
published
a
hazard
communication
standard
in
1983.
that
standard,
which
applied
only
to
the
manufacturing
sector
of
the
economy,
directed
covered
employers
to
develop
written
hazard
communication
programs,
to
compile
and
maintain
material
safety
data
sheets,
to
ensure
that
chemical
containers
are
properly
labeled
and
to
provide
their
employers
with
training
concerning
workplace
chemical
hazards.
omb
conducted
a
paperwork
review
of
that
standard
and
approved
it
in
full.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
rejected
a
number
of
judicial
challenges
to
the
1983
standard
in
the
decision
known
as
steelworkers
i.
the
court
took
the
additional
step
of
ordering
the
secretary
to
consider
extension
of
the
standard
to
the
entire
economy.
the
secretary
commenced
a
new
rule
making
to
consider
that
matter.
respondents
then
initiated
a
contempt
action,
arguing
that
the
secretary
was
obligated
to
make
that
decision
on
the
existing
record.
the
third
circuit
agreed
in
the
decision
known
as
steelworkers
ii,
and
the
court
threatened
the
secretary
with
contempt
sanctions
unless
she
issued
a
final
decision
within
60
days.
the
secretary
complied
with
that
order,
and
on
august
24,
1987
issued
a
revised
hazard
communication
standard
covering
both
the
manufacturing
and
non-manufacturing
sectors
of
the
economy.
he
also
transmitted
the
revised
standard
to
omb
for
paperwork
review.
omb
solicited
comments
and
conducted
a
public
hearing
on
the
revised
standard.
based
on
that
record
omb
disapproved
the
paperwork
requirements
associated
with
three
provisions
of
the
standard.
respondents
then
initiated
a
new
contempt
action,
arguing
that
the
secretary's
submission
of
the
standard
to
omb
violated
the
court's
previous
orders,
because
omb
lacked
authority
to
review
the
pertinent
provisions.
the
court
agreed
and
invalidated
omb's
disapproval.
the
court
acknowledged
that
omb
is
required
to
review
information
collection
requests,
but
it
concluded
that
the
provisions
at
issue
are
insulated
from
omb
authority
because
they
embody
policy...
substantive
policy
decision
making,
and
because
they
do
not
require
the
collection
of
information.
the
government
seeks
reversal
of
that
decision.
as
i
stated
at
the
outset,
the
paperwork
reduction
act
requires
omb
to
review
information
collection
requests.
we
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
concluding
that
the
disapproved
provisions
of
the
hazard
communication
standard
do
not
contain
such
requests.
we
start
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
paperwork
reduction
act
defines
an
information
collection
request
as,
among
other
things,
a
reporting
or
recordkeeping
requirement,
collection
of
information
requirement,
or
other
similar
method
calling
for
the
collection
of
information.
the
disapproved
provisions,
which
required
employers
to
compile,
maintain
and
disclose
chemical
hazard
information,
clearly
fall
within
that
definition.
for
example,
the
three
disapproved
provisions
which
specify
an
employer's
obligations
with
respect
to
multi-employer
worksites,
fda
approved
drugs
and
consumer
products,
all
require
employers
to
compile
and
maintain
material
safety
data
sheets
in
various
circumstances.
thus,
the
disapproved
provisions
plainly
impose
recordkeeping
requirements.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
there
are
three
disapproved
provisions.
the
first
provide...
applied
to
multi-employer
worksites,
and
it
required
that
the
material
safety
data
sheets
be
either
collected
at
the
worksite
at
a
centralized
location,
or
that
each
employer
at
the
worksite
transfer
his
material
safety
data
sheets
to
other
employers.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
other...
the
next
disapproved
provision
was
fda-approved
drugs.
this
would
require,
for
instance,
it
requires
that
a...
for
instance
a
hospital
pharmacy,
comply
with
the
hazard
communications
standard.
so
that,
for
instance,
a
hospital
pharmacist,
in
addition
to
having
to
package
inserts
that
he
would
normally
use
in
evaluating
the
drugs,
would
also
have
to
compile
and
maintain
a
material
safety
data
sheet
for
each
of
those
drugs,
with
the
exception
of
pills
or
tablets.
the
third
provision--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--there
are
no...
all
of...
two
of
these
provisions
are
involved
here.
the
fda-approved
drug
provision
and
the
consumer
products
are
general
exemptions
from
the...
limited
exemptions
from
the
general
requirements
of
the
hazard
communication--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
specifies
what
the
particular
employer's
obligations
might
be.
for
instance,
this
exemption--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
it
was
not
a
complete
exemption,
it
was
only
a
partial
exemption
dealing
with
these
provisions.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
omb--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--omb's
objection
was
that
this
exemption
did
not
go
far
enough,
and
by
not
going
far
enough,
imposed
paperwork
requirements
on
various
regulated
employers.
so
in
that
sense
it
certainly
does
impose
the
hazard
communication--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it...
omb's
position
was
that
the
limited
nature
of
the
exemption
subjected
employers
to
paperwork
burdens.
in
this
case...
let's
take
the
example
of
the
hospital
pharmacist.
under
this
exemption--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--and
omb's
position
was
that
the
exemption
did
not
go
far
enough.
and
that
is
why
it
disapproved
that
provision.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
the
definition
for
collection
of
information.
what
i
quoted
to
you
was
the
definition
for
an
information
collection
request.
the
reason
that...
it
might
be
most
helpful
to
turn
to
the
addendum,
which
has
all
of
these
materials
collected.
omb's
basic
responsibility
is
set
forth
in
section
3504--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--this
is
at
page
3(a)
of
the
statutory
addendum
in
our
brief.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
okay.
section...
subsection
(c)
of
3504
says
the
information
collection
request
clearance
and
other
paperwork
control
functions
of
the
director
shall
include--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--this
is
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
reviewing
and
improving...
and
approving
information
collection
requests
proposed
by
agencies.
we
then
turn
to
the
definition
of
an
information
collection
request,
which
is...
appears
on
page
2
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
the
term
information
collection
request
means
a
written
report
form,
application
form,
schedule,
questionnaire,
reporting
or
recordkeeping
requirement,
collection
of
information
requirement
or
other
similar
method.
it
is
that
latter
portion
that
i
quoted.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
calling
for
the
collection
of
information.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
through
the
use
of
written
report--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--because
the
agency
is
the
party
that
is
making
the
request
that
the
information
be
collected.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
in
referring
to
that,
the
collection
of
information
doesn't
specify
who
the
information
is
sent
to.
it
only
specifies
who
is
making
the
request
here
for
obtaining
or
soliciting
facts
and
opinions.
and
you
note,
for
instance--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
and
what
the
secretary...
and
if
you
continue
reading
on,
i
think
my
point
is
clear.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
through
the
use
of
written
report
forms,
application
forms,
schedules,
questionnaires,
reporting
or
recordkeeping
requirements.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
what
there,
we
submit,
is
being
imposed
here
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--or
that
it
will
be
disclosed
to
the
public.
if
the...
this
provision--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--does
not
specify
who
ultimately
obtains
the...
information
or
where
it
would
be
kept.
and
in
terms
of
recordkeeping
that
also
is
defined,
if
we
turn
to
the
next
page,
to
2(a),
section
17,
the
term
recordkeeping
requirement
means
a
requirement
imposed
by
an
agency
on
persons
to
maintain
specified
records.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
this
is
on
page
2(a),
about
two-thirds
of
the
way
down,
definition
number
17.
and
again,
there
term
recordkeeping--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it's...
well,
i
think
there
is
a
couple
of
responses
to
that.
first
of
all
it
obviously
includes
recordkeeping
requirements.
nothing
is
transmitted
to
an
agency
in
the
course
of
a
recordkeeping
requirement.
rather,
a
party
must
compile
the
records
and
maintain
them.
and
that
in
fact
is
emphasized
by
the
definition
number
17
of
recordkeeping
requirements.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
question
would
be
whether
the
party...
now,
there
are
certain
exemptions--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
but
the
question
would
be
does
the
employer
have
to
gather
or
maintain
information.
now,
in
the
case...
suppose
for
instance
it
was
an
nlrb
publication,
a
notice
to
employers.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
employer
in
that
situation
doesn't
have
to
gather
any
information;
he
simply
has
to
post
it.
so
that
most
likely,
under
the
omb
regulations,
would
not
be
covered.
in
any
case,
most
litigation
matters
are
not
covered.
there
are
separate
exceptions
that
deal...
exemptions
that
deal
with
litigation
matters.
but
our
basic
point
and
the
way
that
omb
applies
this
statute
is
to
look
to
whether
the
party
who
is
subject
to
a
requirement
has
to
gather,
obtain
or
maintain
information.
that
is
the
gist
of
the
requirement
for
an
information
collection
request.
and
if
there
is
an
information
collection
request,
and
under
3504(c),
the
information
collection
request
is
subject
to
omb
review.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
and
so,
for
instance,
a...
control
number
would
have
been
required
and
was
obtained
for
the
regulation,
hazard
communication
standard.
it
does
contain
a
control
number.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
would
be
on...
in
this
case
it
is
on
the
regulation.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it's
a
form
or
a
questionnaire,
for
instance,
it
would
be
on
those
forms
or
questionnaires.
the
notion
of
the
control
number--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no.
a
control
number
is
applied
to
the
instrument
that
requires
the
collection
of
information;
in
this
case
it
is
the
regulation.
and
that
is...
the
purpose
of
the
control
number
is
to
allow
a
person...
among
other
things,
to
allow
a
person
to
determine
whether
omb
has
reviewed
the
information
collection
request.
and
so
a
party
would
look
to
the...
the
regulation
itself,
identify
the
control
number,
and
that
would
verify
that
omb
had
in
fact
reviewed
it.
now,
omb's
implementing
regulations,
which
the
third
circuit
did
not
even
acknowledge,
compels
the
same
result
that
i
have
described
here.
they
state
that
an
information
collection
request
includes
any
requirement
or
request
for
persons
to
obtain,
maintain,
retain,
report
or
publicly
disclose
information.
thus,
omb's
regulations
clearly
contemplate
the
provisions
at
issue
here
would
be
subject
to
omb
review.
respondents
argue
that
the
paper--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
am
afraid
i
don't
follow
that
question.
could
you
repeat
that?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
think,
to
clarify
this,
the
regulation,
in
terms
of
identifying
what
is
an
information
collection
request,
one
could
look
at
the
hazard
communication
itself
as
being
a
general
information
collection
request.
its
general
purpose
is,
as
stated
in
its
very
first
paragraph,
is
to
require
parties
to
compile
and
maintain
and
disclose
information.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
so,
i
think
that
that
is...
that
is
appropriate,
to
view
that
the
hazard
communication
standard
itself,
as
an
information
collection
request.
but
it
also
can
be
viewed
as
consisting
of
a
number
of
different
discrete
information
collection
requests
itself.
now,
omb
will
only
try
to
carve
out
objections
to
those
paperwork
requirements
that
it
finds
objectionable.
and
for
that
reason
it
disapproved
these
exemptions
on
the
basis
that
they
weren't
broad
enough.
it's,
another
way
of
looking
at
this
problem--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--or
more
specifically,
it
disapproved
the
paperwork
requirements
of
that
substantive
requirement.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
as
i
was
saying
before,
the
respondents
principal
argument
here
is
that
the
paperwork
reduction
act
should
apply
only
to
information
collection
requests
that
require
submission
of
information
directly
to
the
government.
but
as
i
have
pointed
out,
that
would
exclude
recordkeeping
requirements,
which
is
one
of
the
main
sources
of
coverage
of
the
paperwork
reduction
act,
and
which
was,
in
fact,
a
major
impetus
for
the
passage
of
this
act.
one
of
the
principal
concerns
of
the
sponsors
was
to
clarify
that
the
predecessor
act,
the
federal
reports
act,
did
in
fact
cover
recordkeeping
requirements,
and
those
would
be
subject
to
omb
review.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
first
we
disagree
with
that,
because
i
think
that
the
act
has
no
express
provision,
nothing
in
the
text
suggests
concretely
that
regular
recordkeeping
requirements
that
have,
would
not
be
viewed
by
the
government,
would
be
covered.
the
definition
of
recordkeeping
requirement
describes
any
recordkeeping
requirement...
any
requirement
that
a
person
maintains
specified
records.
omb
has
clarified
that
in
its
regualtions
to
indicate
that
in
fact
it
does
include
records
that
are
simply
maintained
for...
by
an
individual,
and
are
not
reviewed
by
the
government.
in
any
event,
the
records
that
are
maintained
here
are
reviewed
by
osha.
for
instance,
the
multi-employer
worksite
provision
requires
that
the
parties...
prepare
a
written
hazard
communication
program
describing
how
the
hazard
communication
program
would
apply
in
multi-employer
worksites.
that
written
form
must
be
on
the
site
when
an
osha
inspector
comes
to
visit
and
inspect.
and
that's
one
of
the
ways
in
which
he
insures
compliance,
by
the
fact
that
there
is
a
written
report,
the
written
hazard
communication
program,
that
describes
his
obligations
and
how
he
is
fulfilling
them.
so,
in
fact,
the
only
difference
between
the
osha
situation
and
the
sec
situation
is
that,
in
osha...
in
the
osha
case
the
osha
inspector
goes
to
the
plant,
while
in
the
case
of
the
sec
inspection,
the
materials
are
mailed
to
the
sec
office
in
washington.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
that
would
not
be,
for
two
reasons.
the
first
reason
is,
under
omb's
regulations,
disclosures
of
that
nature,
that
do
not
require
the
compilation
of
information
by
the
individual,
regulated
individual,
are
not
subject
to
omb
review.
the
regulations
state
that.
also,
i
think
that
it
might
be
exempt
under
one
of
the
litigation
exemptions
that
are
contained
in
3502.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
believe
that
sec
believes
that
there
is
coverage
across
the
board.
and
in
fact
there
is
a
recent,
the
sec
recently
issued
a
regulation
and
requested
paperwork
review
and
submitted
it
for
paperwork
review.
this
involved
municipal
securities,
and
in
the
case
of
municipal
securities
nothing
is
filed
with
the
sec.
these...
and
official
information
is
provided
to
a
broker,
and
the
sec
required
that
the
information
be
disseminated
more
broadly.
it
did
seek
review,
paperwork
review
of
that,
and
its
view
is
that
that
is
substantive
paperwork
review.
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
question
whether
it
could
do
that,
because
its
primary
purpose
is
to
determine
whether
the
information
that
is
requested
is
necessary
for
the
proper
performance
of
the
functions
of
its...
of
the
agency.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
so
in
the
context--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
right,
but
nevertheless,
practical
utility
can...
the
government...
the
question
of
practical
utility
turns
on
whether
the
agency
is
able
to
use
the
information
effectively.
the
agency
in
this
case,
osha,
is
using
this
information
by
disseminating
it
to
its...
to
the
public,
and
thereby
fulfilling
one
of
its
requirements--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--or
having
it
disseminated.
and
what
respondents
have
really
asked
for
is
a
distinction
here
between
the
situation
where
an
employer
is
required
to
send
the
information
to
government
and
the
government
disseminates
it,
or
the
situation
where
the
government,
or
the
government
simply
requires
the
individual
to
bear
the
more
onerous
burden
of
disseminating
the
information
directly
to
the
public.
and
we
submit
there
is
no
basis
for
any
distinction.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
or
to
its
employees,
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
burden...
the
number
of
burden
hours
are
calculated
based
on
the
burden
that
is
borne
by
the
individual
who
is
regulated
under
the...
under
the
hazard
communication
standard.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
but
i
don't--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--if
that
was
applied
literally
it
would
simply
mean
the
cost
of
actually
mailing
these
documents
to
the
agency,
and
that
certainly
can't
be
what
it
means.
omb
has
issued
a
clarifying
regulation
on
this
as
well
and
indicates
that
it
is
also
the
burden...
the
burdens
associated
with
public
disclosure.
and
those
can
be
very
substantial
burdens.
i
think
our
petition
points
out
that
they
can
be
up
to
250
million
burden
hours
per
year
in
the
way
that
omb
calculates
these
matters.
in
any
event,
those
calculations
are
conducted
by
the
agency,
which
is
given
a
prescription
by
omb--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i,
in
terms
of...
my
position
is
that
the
omb
regulation
properly
interprets
burden.
but
regardless
of
the
interpretation
of
burden,
the
question
here
is
whether
this
is
an
information
collection
request.
and
we
submit
that
it
certainly
is.
now,
the
definition
of
burden,
the
omb
regulation
specifies
a
broader
calculus
for
making
that
calculation
beyond
what
was
stated
simply
in
the
definition
of
burden,
and
i
think
it
bears
that...
that
interpretation.
we
submit
that
the
court
also
erred
in
this
case
in
holding
that
the
paperwork
reduction
act
does
not
give
omb
authority
to
overrule
an
agency's
determination
of
the
kinds
of
disclosure
needed
to
accomplish
its
substantive
policies.
the
act
expressly
grants
omb
exactly
that
authority.
section
3504(c)
states
that
omb
information
request
clearance
functions
shall
include
determining
whether
the
collection
of
information
by
an
agency
is
necessary
for
the
proper
performance
of
the
functions
of
the
agency,
including
whether
the
information
will
have
practical
utility.
section
3508
uses
the
same
language
to
describe
the
standard
that
omb
must
employ
in
reviewing
information
collection
requests.
thus,
the
act
plainly
authorizes,
and
indeed
requires,
that
omb
to
determine
whether
an
agency's
proposed
collection
of
information
requirements
are
necessary
to
accomplish
the
agency's
functions.
i
believe
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
no,
your
honor,
i
disagree.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
the
standard
for
review
is
set
forth
in
3504(c).
the
information
collection
request
clearance
and
other
paperwork
control
functions
of
the
director
shall
include
reviewing
and
approving
information
collection
requests
proposed
by
agencies.
conducting
that
review,
the
standard
is
then
set
forth
in
3508.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
before
approving
a
proposed
information
collection
request,
the
director
shall
determine
whether
the
collection
of
information
by
an
agency
is
necessary
for
the
proper
performance
of
the
functions
of
the
agency,
including
whether
the
information
will
have
practical
utility.
that
is
the
standard
that
is
applied.
3504(c)
sets
forth
the
requirement
that
agencies
submit
information
collection
requests
to
omb.
omb
then
reviews
it
under
that
standard.
now,
the
term
burden
is
used
elsewhere
in
the
statute,
but
it
is
not
used
in
the
operative
provisions
that
are
at
issue
here.
the
question
here...
i'd
like
to
remind
the
court,
is
the
authority
of
omb
to
review
the
hazard
communication
standard.
that
is
the
issue
that
is
presented.
and
these
are
the
provisions
that
determine
that
authority.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
in
part
because
the
parties
raised
in
their--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
because
the
party
had
raised
this
in
their
brief
in
opposition,
and
we
wanted
to
have
all
of
the
relevant
provisions
at
the
court's
fingertips.
but
it
doesn't
enter
into
the
question
that's
presented
here.
respondents
put
great
reliance
on
all
of
this
inferential
support
for
their
position,
but
the
question
here
is
whether
this
is
an
information
collection
request.
that
is
the
standard
for
determining
whether
the
matter
is
subject
to
omb
review.
and
in
conducting
the
review,
again
the
question
is
whether
it
is
necessary
for
the
proper
performance
of
the
functions
of
the
agency.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
right.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
or
just
a
recordkeeping
requirement.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
frankly
do
not
know.
i
think
that
might
be
an
oversight.
that
might
be
an
oversight.
but
then
again--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
it
is
only
indirect
support,
your
honor.
again,
the
question
here...
is
there
any
doubt
in
the
court's
mind
that
there
are
recordkeeping
requirements
that
are
being
imposed
here?
that
a
pharmacist
who
has
to
collect
10,000
material
safety
data
sheets
and
maintain
them
on
the
premises
is
keeping
a
record?
and
the
question
here
is
whether
the
information
collection
request
is
subject
to
review.
the
information
collection
request
here
is
the
recordkeeping
requirement,
among
a
number
of
other
things.
i
think,
again
i
would
like
to
focus
the
court's
attention
that
the
question
here
is
on
omb's
authority
to
review
the
hazard
communication
standard.
now,
there
has
been
some
confusion
that
has
been
created
about
the
ultimate
decision
here.
this
is
not
an
apa
action
to
review
omb's
decision
in
this
case.
this
came
up
as
a
contempt
action,
and
in
fact
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
even
had
the
record
that
omb
had
compiled
in
making
its
decision.
so,
really
the
only
issue
that
is
presented
here
is
the
question
of
the
authority
of
the
agency.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
other
ground
here
that
the
party
has
raised
is
this
question,
section
3518(e),
which
states
that
nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
be
interpreted
as
increasing
or
decreasing
omb's
authority
with
respect
to
an
agency's
substantive
policies
and
programs.
there
are
some
key
things
that
a
court
must
focus
on
in
this.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
this
issue,
about
whether--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
i
do
agree
that
that
is
before
it.
in
fact
we
briefed
it
extensively.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
and
our
point
with
respect
to
that
is
that
the
information...
again
this
is
a
qualification
on
the
court's...
on
omb's
authority.
but
what
it
states
is
that
nothing
shall
be
interpreted
as
increasing
or
decreasing
omb's
authority.
now,
if
you
refer
to
the
federal
reports
act
and
it's,
the
paperwork
reduction
act's
predecessor,
section
3506,
it
employed
the
very
same
standard
for
reviewing
whether
an
information...
whether
an
information
collection
request
should
go
forward,
whether
it
is
necessary
for
the
proper
performance
of
the
function
of
the
agency.
what
i
think
3518(e)
indicates
is
there
has
simply
been
no
change
in
the
standard
of
review
that
omb
subjects
these
information
collection
requests
to.
now,
the
expansion,
or
the
scope
of
an
information
collection
request
has
been
clarified
to
include
recordkeeping
requirements.
that
was
one
of
the
chief
purposes
of
the
act,
to
clarify
that
recordkeeping
requirements
would
be
subject
to
omb
review.
but
all
3518(e)
does
is
indicate
that
as
an
interpretive
matter
nothing
except
express...
omb
has
the
powers
that
are
expressly
given
here.
and
that
includes
the
express
power
to
determine
whether
a
matter
is
necessary
for
the
proper
functioning
of
the
agency.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
only--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--they
are,
primarily
the
concerns
here
are
recordkeeping,
although
there
is
also
disclosure.
the
court's
ruling
was
that
none
of
this
would
be
subject
to
omb
review.
we
indicated
that
omb
in
fact
reviews
labels
as
well
as
other
matters,
insofar
as
they
require
a
party
to
compile
and
maintain
information.
for
instance,
if
you
have
to
prepare
a
nutrition
label
in
the
fda
context--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--what
omb
applies
is
the
standard--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
that
is
in
part
right,
your
honor.
but
remember,
omb
employs
this...
looks
at
the
standard
that
the
agency
employs
in
making
its
determinations.
it
looks
to
what
the
agency's
mission
is,
as
set
forth
in
the
statutes.
and
then
it
takes
a
look
at
whether
the
agency
has
in
fact
met
that
requirement.
this
is
simply
a
matter
of
interagency
review,
to
review...
to
prevent
duplication
of
efforts,
to
make
sure
that,
for
instance,
fda
is
not
doing
something
that
conflicts
with
what
osha
is
doing.
and
it
makes
perfect
sense
that
a
centralized
agency
in
the
government
should
be
able
to
review
these
matters
before
they
come
to
the
court
for
the
court's
review.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
we
think
that
omb
does
have
that
authority
to
review
other
agencies
actions
here
with
respect
to
whether
they
are
collecting
information
that
is
necessary
for
the
performance
of
their
function.
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
