m.

i
take
it
that
a
control
number
is
required
for
every
information
request?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
if
the
regulations
here
had
been
approved,
the
control
number
would
simply
be
on
the
information
request?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
all
of
the
documents...
that
the
employers
had
to
assemble
pursuant
to
this
regulation,
they
would
not
have
had
to
have
a
control
number
even
if
they
had
been
approved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
did
the
agency
measure...
omb
measure
the
burden
in
this
case?
did
it
measure
the
burden
imposed
by
making
all
of
these
records,
or
is
there
no
burden
because
the
agency
doesn't
receive
anything
back?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
though
the
statute
says
the
burden
means
the
time
and
effort...
that's
3502(3):
the
term
burden
means
the
time,
effort
and
financial
resources
expended
by
persons
to
provide
information
to
a
federal
agency.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
i
take
it
this
is
your
same
argument,
that
this
is
all
information
being
provided
to
the
agency?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
it
your
position
that
the
burden
in
this
case
is
measured
by
all
of
the
hours
taken
to
compile
the
documents
by
the
employers,
and
that
that
is
all
information
provided
to
a
federal
agency?
