mr.
minear,
you
went
through
the
statutory
language
a
little
fast
for
me,
to
tell
you
the
truth,
on
the
collection
of
information.
are
you
relying
on
the
statutory
provision
that
is
quoted
at
page
3
of
your
brief
when
you
say
collection
of
information?
because
you
left
out
a
good
deal
of
text,
and
i
have
a
little
trouble--
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
the
statute
or
is
this...
this
is
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says
calling
for
the
collection
of
information,
is
what
it
ends
with.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
that
is
defined
with
the...
in
the
statutory
provision
on
page
3
of
your
brief,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
defined
as
collection
of
information,
the
obtaining
or
soliciting
of
facts
or
opinions
by
an
agency.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
is
this
by
an
agency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
how
is
the
collecting
by
an
agency,
because
your...
the
information
collection
request
refers
to...
to
collection
of
information.
and
as
i
understand
the
definition
of
collection
of
information,
it
refers
to
collection
of
information
by
agencies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that
isn't
right.
the
obtaining
of
facts,
soliciting
facts
or
information
is
by
an
agency.
justice
john
paul
stevens
through
the
use
of
written
report
forms.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
a
record...
requirement
of
keeping
records
so
that
the
agency
will
be
able
to
get
the
information
it
wants.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
what
it
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
minear,
their
point
is,
i
think,
that
it
covers
recordkeeping
requirements
that,
when
the
records
are
kept
for
inspection
by
the
government
to
carry
out
its
law
enforcement
responsibilities,
like
opa
used
to
require
business
to
keep
all
sorts
of
records.
that's
the
kind
of
thing
they
wanted
to
be
sure...
it
wasn't
to
keep,
to
have
records
for
investigation
or
inspection
by
third
parties,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
the
labor
board
entered
an
order
saying
there
was
unfair
labor
practice
and
required
that
notices
be
posted
to
the
employees
telling
them
that
steps
had
been
taken
to
comply.
is
that
subject
to
omb
review?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about...
the
sec,
i
notice
in
the
legislative,
had
a
lot
of
interest
in
it...
i
take
it
registration
statements
would
be
subject
to
this
requirement.
what
about
prospectuses
that
are
sent
out
to
potential
purchasers
of
securities
and
the
like?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
agree
that
both
grounds
for
the
court
of
appeal
decision
are
before
us,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand,
but
do
you
agree
that
issue
is
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
the
3518(e).
