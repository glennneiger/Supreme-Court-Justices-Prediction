mr.
minear,
before
you
go
further,
i
share
justice
white's
confusion
as
to...
as
to
how
this
exception
can
be
possibly
held
to
be
imposing
any
requirement.
is
there
any
way
that
this
case
can
be
viewed
as
involving
the
regulation
to
which
the
exception
is
an
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
the
regulation
requiring
the...
the
maintaining
of
these
records
and
the
giving
of
this
information,
that
is...
is
the
gravamen
of
the
government
activity
that...
that
the
parties
are
complaining
about,
not
the
exception
to
that.
is
there
any
way
that
we
can
regard
this
case
as
involving
the
principle
regulation,
rather
than
merely
the
scope
of
the
exception
from
the
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
why
isn't
that
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
disapprove
the
exemption,
it
disapproved
the
substantive
portion
of
the
rule
to
which
the
exemption
applied.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
procedural
status
of
the
case
permits
us
to
view
it
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
those
are
old
cases,
mr.
gold.
i
really
don't
know
that
in
any
modern
cases
we
have
really
tried
to
draw
that
old
line
that
agencies
are
entitled
to
no
deference
when
they
are
deciding
their
own
jurisdiction.
those
are
oldies
and
baddies.
i
don't
really
think
we've...
we
have
used--
justice
antonin
scalia
--every
time,
as
the
chief
justice
suggested,
every
question
that
comes
up
is
a
question
of
the
agency's
authority.
does
the
agency
have
authority
to
do
this?
it
is
always
deciding
its
jurisdiction.
so,
you
know,
to
say
that
you
can't,
you
can't
give
it
deference
when
it
is
deciding
its
jurisdiction
is
to
say
that
you
can't
give
it
deference,
period.
it
has
no
jurisdiction
to
act
unlawfully.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
really
before
us,
though,
that
issue,
is
it?
i
mean,
do
we
have
to
decide
whether,
assuming
omb
has
the
authority
to
review
these
things,
its
review
was
arbitrary
or
capricious?
that
is
not
here,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gold,
you
did...
you
did
make
this
argument
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
too,
so
we
couldn't
get
rid
of
it
on
some
procedural
nicety,
i
suppose?
justice
antonin
scalia
"most
adequately"
is
a...
is
a
strange
phrase,
isn't
it.
i
mean,
you
could
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
know,
but
what
does
it
mean?
"most
certainly"
would
make
your
case
easily,
but
"most
adequately"
you
might
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
know,
it
is
the
best-balanced
provision
around,
and
that
would
justify
what
omb
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
looking
at
the
definitions
here,
and
the
one
that
jumps
out
at
me
is
the
definition
of
burden.
it
is
central
to
the
whole
operation
of
this
omb
process
that
they
have
to
determine
whether
the
burden
is
excessive
in
relation
to
the
benefits
that
the
government
is
going
to
get
out
of
this
thing.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
essential?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
the
word
burden
is
not...
why
was
the
definition
of
burden
printed
in
your
addendum
if
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
provisions
at
issue
in
the
case
before
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
to
confuse
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
all
right.
at
least
it
requires
this,
that
the
agency
has
to
submit
to
the
director
an
estimate
of
the
burden
that
will
result
from
the
information
collection
request,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
would
the
government
require
the
agency
to
sub...
if,
if
an
information
request
includes
what
you
say
it
does,
a
request
that
you
give
information
to
somebody
else--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
just
a
recordkeeping
requirement.
why
would
they
limit
the
burden
that
the
agency
has
to
tell
omb
about
to
the
following:
the
term
burden
means
the
time,
effort
or
financial
resources
expended
by
persons
to
provide
information
to
a
federal
agency.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
either
an
oversight
or
it's
support
for
mr.
gold's
interpretation.
it
could
be
either
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
go
to
the
scope
of
the
reviewing
authority
anyway.
i
mean,
that
same
problem
arises
if
you
say
that
all
that
omb
can
review
is
requests
for
information
to
be
provided
to
the
agency.
you
still
get
into
the
same
kind
of
a
problem,
don't
you,
of
omb
second
guessing
the
agency
as
to
what
is
necessary?
