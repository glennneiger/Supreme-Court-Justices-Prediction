justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
other
case
is
88-143,
dole
verus
the
united
steel
workers.
the
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit.
among
the
regulatory
tools
available
to
government
agencies
charged
with
protecting
public
health
and
safety
are
rules
which
require
regulated
entities
and
disclose
information
directly
to
employees,
consumers,
or
others.
the
disclosure
rules
protect
by
providing
access
to
information
about
what
dangers
exist,
and
how
these
dangers
can
be
avoided.
today
we
decide
whether
the
office
of
management
and
budget
has
the
authority
under
the
paperwork
reduction
act
of
1980
to
review
such
regulations.
we
hold
that
the
paperwork
reduction
act
does
not
give
the
office
of
management
and
budget
the
authority
to
review
and
control
agency
regulations
mandating
disclosure
by
regulated
entities
directly
to
third
parties
and
therefore,
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
dissents
and
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
has
joined.
