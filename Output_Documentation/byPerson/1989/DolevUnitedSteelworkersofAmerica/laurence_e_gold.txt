mr.
laurence
e.
gold
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
mr.
minear
indicated
at
the
end,
but
only
at
the
end
of
his
argument,
we
believe
there
are
two
questions
here
and
that
the
ruling
below
rests
on
two
grounds.
the
first
question
is
whether
the
hazard
communication
standard,
and
in
particular
the
aspects
of
the
standard
disproved
by
omb,
are
information
collection
requests.
the
second
is
whether
omb
acted
properly,
taking
into
account
the
entirety
of
the
paperwork
reduction
act,
and
most
particularly
the
portions
of
the
act
that
we
reproduce
on
page
39
of
our
brief,
which
state
that
the
authority
of
omb
shall
be
exercised
consistent
with
applicable
law
and
that
nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
be
interpreted
as
increasing
or
decreasing
the
authority
of
omb
with
respect
to
the
substantive
policies
and
programs
of
departments,
agencies
and
offices,
acted
properly
in
disapproving
these
provisions.
our
basic
position,
which
has
been
foreshadowed
by
the
discussion
thus
far,
is
that
when
congress
talked
about
information
collection
requests,
as
the
language
of
the
statute
persuasively
indicates,
congress
was
talking
about
the
collection
of
information
by
the
government
and
for
the
government
use.
the
indications
are
numerous
in
this
regard
and
we
lay
out
the
basic
points
at
pages
24
and
25
of
our
brief.
first
of
all,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
this
statute
has
to
do
with
alleviating
certain
burdens
on
private
parties,
and
the
burdens
are
defined
as
the
time,
effort
or
financial
resources
expended
by
persons
to
provide
information
to
a
federal
agency.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
we...
we
think
that
they
are
entitled
to
a
certain
amount
of
deference,
but
you
get
into
the
question
which
is
one
which
is...
we
well
understand
a
difficult
one,
whether
omb
is
moving
into
an
area
that
was
never
intended
by
congress
to
be
regulated.
this
is
an
issue
that
has
proved
perplexing
to
the
court.
the
proposition
that
an
agency
of
limited
jurisdiction,
which
is
given
a
limited
function,
can
expand
that
function--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--and
there
are
line...
there
are
these
line-drawing
questions
which
we
think
are
inherent
in
the
point
you've
just
articulated,
and
that
there
is
a
threshold
question
every
time
an
agency
asks
for
deference.
is
the
agency
attempting
to
move
into
an
area
which
congress
didn't
permit
the
agency
to
enter
at
all.
i
mean,
this
is
a
problem,
and
we
quote
the
cases
which
have
been
particularly
acute
in
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
in
cases
like
insurance
agents,
the
court
said
that
the
issue
of
whether
the
agency
could
regulate
the
economic
weapons
of
parties
when
they
were
engaged
in
collective
bargaining
was,
i
think
i
have
the
quote
right,
simply
not
a
question
that
was
given
to
the
agency
to
ask
and
answer.
and
noted
quickly
that
where
the
question
is
one
that
was
given
to
ask,
then
deference
is
appropriate.
so--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--we
think
they
are
oldies
and
goodies.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
plainly
it
has
no
jurisdiction
to
act
unlawfully.
and
i
do
think
that
there
is
a
problem
in
speaking
in
metaphors
of
this
kind,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
isn't
a
basic
kernel
of
truth.
there
is,
it
seems
to
us,
quite
a
paradox
in
saying
that
if
the
agency
wants
to
aggrandize
its
authority
and
congress
has
provided
for
judicial
review,
the
judiciary
is
to
accept
that
aggrandizing
step
if
it
is
reasonable.
there
are
other
areas
where
there...
where
it's
quite
plain
that
the
question
arises
in
the
interstices
of
the
statute
within
an
area
that
is
the
agency's
where
that
problem
just
doesn't
arise.
but,
for
the
purpose
of
this
discussion,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
two
alternatives.
we
grasp
at
both
of
them.
first
is
that
this
isn't
the
kind
of
issue,
when
you
look
at
the
entire
statute,
in
which
omb
is
entitled
to
deference.
secondly,
there
is
a
limit
in
deference,
and
omb,
giving
it
deference,
deserves
to
lose
this
case.
it
does
seem,
to
us,
for
the
reasons
i
was
starting
to
develop
and
that
have
been
noted
by
various
members
of
the
court,
that
there
isn't
a
word
in
this
statute
which
pushes
towards
the
conclusion
that
congress
intended
to
cover
as
an
information
collection
requirement
materials
which,
as
a
substantive
matter
a
has
to
provide
to
b
for
b's
protection,
as
opposed
to
materials
which,
as
the
statute
says
again
and
again
are
provided
to
the
government
for
its
use
either
in
policy
making
or
law
making
or
in
law
enforcement.
the
definition
of
burden,
the
use
of
the
term
collection
by
an
agency
in
the
critical
definition,
collection
of
information
requirement,
and
the
entire
point
of
the
exercise,
which
is
to
determine
whether
the
information
has
practical
utility,
which
is
defined
to
mean
the
ability
of
an
agent...
of
an
agency
to
use
information
it
collects,
particularly
the
capability
to
process
such
information
in
a
timely
and
useful
fashion.
every
part
of
the
statute
most
fairly
read
speaks
to
the
question
which,
not
surprisingly
the
legislative
history
shows
was
the
only
question
posed
to
congress,
namely,
should
there
be
a
system
of
rationalizing
and
assuring
that
the
bureaucracy's
appetite
for
information
for
its
own
use,
particularly
in
the
planning
stage,
should
be
reviewed
and
should
be
subject
to
efficiency
and
other
rationality
controls.
efficiency
and
rationality
controls
by
an
agency,
namely
omb,
which
has
an
overall
management
function
for
the
government,
and
which
has
no
particular
parochial
interest
in
the
information
at
hand.
and
we
have
no
doubt
that
the
paperwork
reduction
act,
in
those
terms,
in
its
efficiency
terms
in
assuring
that
agencies
only
ask
for
what
they
can
use
and
demonstrate
that
what
they
are
asking
for
can
be,
as
the
statute
so
strongly
indicates,
can
be
processed
and
assimilated
in
a
rational
way.
not
surprisingly,
omb's
spokesman
at
the
hearings,
and
this
on
page
26
of
our
brief,
said
no
one
questions
the
basic
need
of
the
for
information
to
plan,
make
policy
decisions,
operate
and
evaluate
programs,
and
perform
necessary
research.
the
question
is
rather,
how
much
information
is
essential.
so
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
planning,
programmatic
type
of
effort.
there
is
not
a
word,
despite
the
fact
that
there
are
a
myriad
of
labeling
requirements
and
myriad
of
other
regulatory
requirements
concerning
the
provision
of
information
to
third
parties
in
the
legislative
history
concerning
these
very
different
types
of
regulations.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
the
kind
of
materials
you
have
here,
and
the
issue
you
have
here,
is
different
from
the
kind
of
issue
that
was
discussed
at
great
length
in
the
legislative
history
and
that
is
adverted
to
in
the
little,
literal
language
of
the
statute
in
three
different
respects.
if
an
agency
wishes
to
seek
information
for
its
own
use,
the
inquiry,
when
the
matter
is
reviewed
by
omb,
as
i
have
indicated,
is
is
more
information
better.
can
you
use
this
information?
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it?
how
will
you
process
it?
how...
what
are
your
people
doing
now?
how
is
this
going
to
work?
in
contrast,
in
the
situation
that
we
have
here,
the
hazard
communication
standard,
the
agency,
under
a
particular
statute,
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act,
and
in
particular
its
section
6(b)(5)
and
6(b)(7),
face
the
question
of
how
do
you
reduce
the
risks
in
operating
circumstances
of
handling
hazardous
chemicals.
and
the
result
was
a
determination
that
we
are
not
going
to
ban
the
use
of
these
chemicals,
we're
not
going
to
regulate
how
they
are
used,
what
processes
they
are
used
by.
but
rather,
we
are
going
to
take
what
seems
to
us
on
any
account
to
be
a
far
more
passive
form
of
regulation.
we
are
going
to
require
that
if
you
act
to
circulate
these
potentially
hazardous
chemicals
in
interstate
commerce,
you
have
to
advise
people
what
the
chemicals
are,
what
effects
they
may
have,
how
they
can
adversely
effect
individuals,
and
how
they
can
be
safely
used.
and
in
those
terms
the
comparison
here
is
entirely
different
from
the
kind
of
comparison
you
do
between
more
information
and
less
information
in
a
normal
collection
of
information,
or
in
collection
of
information
covered
by
this
statute.
because
the
comparison
is
the
burden
on
chemical
manufacturers,
the
economy,
downstream
employers,
of
having...
commanding
control
regulation
or
process
regulation,
versus
the
kind
of
burden
imposed
here.
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
which
instructs
omb
how
to
do
that
kind
of
job,
or
which
indicates
that
congress
thought
that
that
kind
of
job
was
the
kind
of
job
that
omb
should
be
doing.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
correct.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
correct.
it
was
really
invalidating
the
underlying
substantive
requirement
that
was
left
when
osha
was
finished.
in
other
words,
to
talk
about
the
substance
of
these
exemptions,
osha
said
that,
with
regard
to
drugs,
if
the
drug
was
in
its
final
form
you
didn't
have
to
provide
additional
information,
training
and
so
on.
but
if
it
wasn't,
given
the
fact
that
particularly
in
hospitals
the
people
who
were
handling
the
materials
were
faced
with
quite
different
hazards,
then
the
ultimate
consumer
would
be...
that
you
did
have
to
provide
these
hazard
warnings.
omb
said
if
it
is
covered
by
fda
we
don't
care,
at
least
outside
the
manufacturing
sector.
the
rationality
of
what
omb
did
here
wouldn't
survive,
so
far
as
at
least
we
can
understand
it,
any
form
of
review.
but
they
said
in
the
manufacturing
sector,
it's
all
right
to
protect
people
in
the
way
that
osha
did.
but
outside
the
manufacturing
sector,
and
hospitals
are
outside
the
manufacturing
sector,
it
is
not
all
right
to
protect
people
with
these
added
warnings.
the
reason,
the
reason
is
known
to
omb
but
can't
be
found
in
its
documents.
then,
with
regard
to
consumer
products,
omb
said
that
there
was
no
need
to
provide
the
particular
information
that
osha
had
required
because
the
products
were
subject
to
review
by
the
consumer
product
safety
commission.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
it
seems
to
us
that
it
is
here.
the
government
is
the
master
of
its
own
petition,
but
as
i
indicated
when
we
began,
the
two...
in
the
court
below
they
gave
two
grounds.
ground
number
one
was
that
this
kind
of
requirement
is
not
an
information
collection
request,
because
it
is
for
the
use
of
third
parties.
ground
number
two
is
that,
in
light
of
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
product...
the
paperwork
reduction
act,
which
i
have
noted
in
3504(a)
and
3518(e)--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
the
only
thing
i
can't
figure
out
of
that,
chief
justice,
is
that
on
that
view,
this
petition
ought
to
be
dismissed
and
we
ought
to
win.
because,
as
i
said,
the
court
below
gave
two
grounds.
and
the
second
ground--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--if...
i...
i
don't
understand
what
the
government
is
about
in
this,
and
they've
saved
time
for
rebuttal,
i
leave
it
to
them.
we
pointed
out
in
the
brief
in
opposition
that...
and
this
is
not
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
that
the
lower
court
used,
but
we
pointed
out
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
we
point
it
out
again
in
our
brief,
that
the
court
below
invalidated
what
omb
did
on
two
grounds.
if
only
one
of
those
grounds
is
here,
unless
there
is
some
theory
that
once
the
court
below
has
told
that
ground
one
is
unsound,
even
though
the
two
grounds
were
in
the
alternative,
something
will
change,
that
there
ought
to
be
a
remand,
we
don't
understand
what...
what
is
going
on
here.
but
we
believe
that
the
court
below
is
right
on
both
its
independent
grounds,
and
that's--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
i
presume,
to
deal
with
the
second
of
these
two
questions,
you
would
have
to
confront
our
arguments
that
omb
disregarded
the
substantive
policies
and
programs
of
the
statute,
and
therefore
acted
improperly
in
this
case.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes.
that
is
part
of
construing
what
the
paperwork
reduction
act
is
about.
i
mean,
the
government
says
on
this
part
of
the
case,
that
the
paperwork
reduction
act
says
that
the
omb
director
can
review
paperwork
collection
requests
to
determine
whether
they
are
necessary
for
the
proper
performance
of
the
functions
of
the
agency.
that
is
the
statutory
language.
a
question
that
was
confronted
by
the
court
below,
that
we
raised
that
was
confronted
by
the
court
below,
and
that
as
we
read
the
opinion
in
the
petition
appendix
at
8a,
decided
in
our
favor,
is
that
in
determining
what
is
necessary
for
the
performance
of
the
functions
of
the
agency,
omb
has
to
take
account
of
and
conform
to
the
substantive
requirements
in
this
instance
of
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act.
and
that
omb
did
not
do
so
in
this
case.
and
that
that
is
demonstrable.
not
only,
as
i
have
indicated,
is
it
hard
to
find
a
scintilla
of
reason
in
what
omb
did
in
terms
of
the
lines
it
drew,
but
much
more
to
the
point,
as
i
started
to
note,
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act
sets
out
a
highly
protective
standard
with
regard
to
the
balance
between
employer
financial
interests
and
employee
safety
and
health
interests.
this
court
has
put
it,
in
american
textile
manufacturers,
which
is
at
452
u.s.,
that
section
6(b)(5)
of
osha
directs
the
secretary
to
issue
the
standard
that
most
adequately
assures
that
no
employee
will
suffer
material
impairment
of
health,
limited
only
by
the
extent
to
which
this
is
capable
of
being
done.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
we
tried
to--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--prevent
that.
and
we
make
the
argument
starting
at
page
39
through
to
the
conclusion
of
our
brief
on
the
merits.
and
our
basic
point
on
this
is
that
if
indeed
this
is
a
collection
of
information
request,
that
at
least
where
the
statute
is
as
plain
and
clear
as
this
statute
is,
omb
cannot,
in
the
guise
of
determining
whether
something
is
necessary
for
the
performance
of
the
function
of
the
agency,
rewrite
the
balance
in
a
way
which
is
entirely
different
from
the
underlying
substantive
statute.
that
just
reads
out
of
the
paperwork
reduction
act
itself
the
provision
that
in
carrying
out
its
functions
it
has
to
respect
the
substantive
policies
and
programs.
and
here
it
is
absolutely
manifest,
for
the
reasons
that
we
develop,
that
omb
applied
a
completely
different
standard
in
determining
what
ought
to
be
promulgated
to
employees
than
the
osh
act
mandates.
the
conclusion
with
regard
to
this
multi-employer
worksite
issue
at
omb
was
that
osha
is
wrong
that
employees
need
or
will
use
this
information.
employers
will
have
difficulty
coordinating
the
provision
of
the
information.
they
may
have
to
have
multiple
file
cabinets,
and
therefore
osha
should
go
do
it
again.
well,
that
is
fine
if
you
don't
have
an
act
that
says
that
the
secretary
of
labor
is
supposed
to
set
a
standard
that
"most
adequately"
assures
that
no
employee
will
suffer
impairment
of
health,
and
in
which,
as
this
court
said,
congress
itself
defined
the
basic
relationship
between
cost
and
benefits
by
placing
the
benefit
of
worker
health
above
all
other
considerations.
with
regard
to
the--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--it's
a
statutory
phrase.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
there's
a
feasibility--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i
doubt
that
it
would,
even
if
this
court
hadn't
already
construed
the
language,
because
the
secretary
of
labor
had
raised,
had
come
to
the
opposite
conclusion
on
what
"most
adequately"
assures.
and
if
we
are
going
to
have
deference,
the
deference
there
goes
to
the
secretary
of
labor,
unless
you
are
going
to
read
out
the
provision
that
these...
that
the
paperwork
reduction
act
doesn't
increase
omb's
authority
and
is
not
to
be
used
to
trench
on
the
substantive
policies
and
programs.
now,
obviously
there
are
some
limits
here,
and
we
note
them.
but
when
you
are
talking
about
an
express
provision
of
the
underlying
statute,
and
omb
says
we
strike
the
calculus
differently
than
you
do,
this
isn't
a
question
of
whether
you
can
use
the
information
as
an
efficiency,
but
rather
it
is
our
determination
about
what
the
underlying
act
requires,
what
these
employees
really
need.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
i
apologize,
justice.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
it
got
over
to
omb
because
these
agencies,
out
of--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yes.
out
of
a
concern
for
their
budgets.
this
is
the
office
of
management
and
budget.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well,
we
believe
that
they
shouldn't
have
sent
them
over
at
all,
but
as--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--we
believe
not.
we
believe
not.
we
believe
that
the
third
circuit
was
right
on
both
its
first
ground
and
its
second
ground.
but
even
if
we
are
wrong
on
the
first
and
it
should
have
gone
over
to
omb--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--then
omb
went
beyond
its
limited
charted,
because
it
got
into
the
question
of
what
this
statute,
what
the
underlying
substantive
statute,
the
occupational
safety
and
health
act,
requires
employers
to
provide
employees.
and
let
me
make
one
other
point
about
that
if
i
could.
omb
got
into
the
question
not
of
what
information
should
be
collected,
or
even
what
information
should
be
retained,
but
what
information
should
be
disseminated
by
an
employer
to
a
third
party.
there's
absolutely
nothing
in
this
statute
about
that.
