justice
white
well,
it
may...
they
may
be
different,
but
i
am
not
sure
which
way
it
leans.
it
may...
you
say
it
prevents
the
private
mandatory
injunction
and
permits
the...
i
would
think
you
could
argue
that
it
is
just
the
reverse.
justice
white
all
you're
saying
is
it
is
prohibitory
relief
to...
you
just,
you
enjoin
the
continuance
of
the
patent
pool.
justice
white
well,
that
is
just
a
play
on
words,
isn't
it?
can't
you
enjoin
the
continuance
of
the
combined
operation
of
these
two
stores?
justice
white
well,
a
year
after
a
merger
takes
place,
a
plaintiff
who
thinks
he
has
been
hurt
by
the
merger
that
he
thinks
violated
antitrust
laws
can
sue
and
get
some
damages,
i
suppose,
if
he
can
prove
antitrust
injury.
justice
white
and
i
suppose
then
that
the
day
after
the
merger
there
is
or
was
threatened
loss
or
injury.
justice
white
and
you
say
that
he
can't
get
an
injunction...
he
can't
sue
to
get
an
injunction
the
day
after
the
merger
on
account
of
the
threatened
loss
or
injury?
justice
white
well,
can't
he...
i
take
it
you
say
though
that
even
though
he
can
prove
the
day
after
the
merger
that
he
is
really
threatened
with
loss
or
injury,
you
cannot
avoid...
you
cannot
get
an
injunction
to
avoid
that
loss
or
injury
by
getting
a
divestiture
order.
justice
white
loss
or
injury.
justice
white
you
have
to
wait
to
get
hurt.
justice
white
you
must
wait
to
be
put
out
of
business.
justice
white
well,
why,
you
do
have
to
wait.
you
can't
get
an
injunction,
because
this
merger
is
going
to
do
exactly
what
you
fear.
and
a
year
later
you
can
get
all
the
money
you
want
for
being
put
out
of
business.
but
you
cannot
get
an
injunction
against
it.
justice
white
well...
well
on
that
basis
you
will
say,
on
that
basis
you
would
say
the
merger
just
isn't
illegal,
unless
you
get
some
other
injury.
justice
white
well,
you...
i
would
think
if,
even
a
year
later
then,
that
he
would
have
some
trouble
recovering,
unless
he
proves
some
special
practices
that
occurred
from
the
merger.
justice
white
how
was
it
acquired?
justice
white
what
was
it
here?
justice
white
what
was
it
here?
how
was...
how
did
this
merger
take
place?
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
not
on
the
floor.
how
about
in
the
senate?
justice
white
well,
so
much
the
better
maybe.
[laughter]
justice
white
you're
perfectly
content
with
saying
that
it
is
a
reasonable
reading
of
section
15
to
say
that
government
can
get
an
injunction
requiring
divestiture?
justice
white
well,
but
do
you
have
to
say
it
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
language.
justice
white
so
you
think
the
big
debate
was
just
a
lot
of
hot
air
before
the
congress
about
whether
private
parties
should
have
the
power
to
dissolve
a
combination?
justice
white
well,
you
could
say
well
that's
a
prohibitory
injunction,
continuing
to
have
the
combination.
justice
white
to
dissolve
a
monopoly.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be...
that
may
be
the
case,
but
if
you
say
that
section
16
doesn't
give
authority
to
dissolve
a
trust,
how
come
it
gives
authority
to
order
divestiture
that's
in...
that
violates
section
7?
