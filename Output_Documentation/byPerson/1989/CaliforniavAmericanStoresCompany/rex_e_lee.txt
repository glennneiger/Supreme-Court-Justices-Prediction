mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
just
very
briefly
with
respect
to
what
issue
is
before
this
court,
i
think
that
the
second
question
presented,
fairly
read,
does
not
include
anything
other
than
what
the
second
question
presented
says,
which
is
whether
a
preliminary
injunction
preserving
the
possibility
of
divestiture
is
authorized
by
section
16.
it
says
nothing
about
any
hold
separate
agreement.
the
brief
appears
to
acknowledge
the
correctness
of
the
ninth
circuit's
ruling
on
that
aspect
of
the
case.
and
then,
justice
scalia,
it
is
in
footnote
1,
and
the
way
it
is
raised
is,
was
this
final
under
delaware
law.
and
if
there
is
anything
on
which
this
court
did
not
grant
certiorari
it
was
to
decide
who
was
right
as
a
matter
of
delaware
law.
now,
the
case
really
boils
down
to
a
simple
matter
of
statutory
interpretation.
the
petitioner
is
quite
right
in
this
respect.
that
in
1914
congress
expanded
the
package
of
remedies
available
to
private
plaintiffs
to
include
equitable
relief.
and
in
that
respect
their
relief
is
the
same
as
that
of
the
federal
government.
but
the
further
proposition,
that
private
remedies
were
to
be
identical
to
those
of
the
federal
government,
is
rejected
by
the
statute
on
its
face
and
by
every
rule
of
statutory
interpretation
that
is
applicable
here.
if
the
package
of
private
remedies
were
identical,
then
why
two
separate
sections?
and
why
separate
language
in
each
of
the
sections?
now,
we
are
told
that
the
reason
is
that
the
government
must...
doesn't
need
to
show
any
injury,
and
that
is
just
flat
wrong.
these
are,
as
mr....
as
mr.
horn
has
pointed
out--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--but
it
does
have
to
show
some
kind
of
injury.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
but
i
would
observe,
justice
stevens,
that
if
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
separate
language,
then
it
is
strange...
it's
a
strange
way
to
express
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
but
there
is.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
difference
is
this.
the
difference
is
this,
and
we
did,
in
fact,
with
respect,
quote
section
15.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
oh,
i
apologize.
yes,
we
did
not
quote
the
whole
section.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
guess
it
was
just
because
we
were
up
against
the
page
limits.
i
wondered
about
the
same
thing,
but--
the
crucial
language...
the
crucial
language
in
section
15
does
need
to
be
noted,
and
that
it
is,
that
it
is
proceedings
in
equity,
and
that
is
quite
different
from
the
language--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--as
opposed
to,
on
the
other
hand,
injunctive
relief,
and
then
there
are
two
important
qualifiers.
one
is
threatened
loss
or
damage,
which
does
not
appear
in
section
15,
and...
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say...
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
but
the
language
really
goes
beyond
just
requiring
that
he
show
antitrust
injury.
this
is
the
language
that
is
just
an
insuperable
obstacle,
in
my
view,
for
the
petitioner--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
in
16,
and
it
is
printed
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
it
is
the
end
of
the
relevant
language:
"when
and
under
the
same
conditions
and
principles
as
injunctive
relief
against
threatened
conduct
that
will
cause
loss
or
damage
is
granted
by
courts
of
equity.
"
conduct.
that's
what
the
private
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
enjoin.
not
structure.
not
status.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
just
the
fact
that
the
difference
in
language--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
what
it
talks
about
is
equitable
proceedings
or
equitable
relief.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
except
that
the
mandatory-prohibitory
distinction
also
looks
toward
a
difference
between
conduct,
behavior,
things
that
people
do,
on
the
one
hand,
and
structure
on
the
other,
referring
back
to
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
about
the
corporation
that
has
been
in
existence.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
which
i
intend
to
get
to
in
just
a
moment,
it
is
full
of
examples.
the
rogers...
the
rogers-carlin
exchange,
the
floyd-untermeyer
exchange,
about
the
difference
between
on
the
one
hand
prohibiting
conduct,
things
that
may
happen
in
the
future.
and
they
specifically
refer
to
why
not
give
them
a
mandatory
injunction;
they
don't
have
it
now.
that
is
in
the
rogers
exchange.
on
the
one
hand,
and
structure,
and
structure
on
the
other.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
let
me
say
two
things
in
that
respect,
justice
stevens.
the
first
is
we
think
that
there
is
jurisdiction
to
dissolve
a
patent
pool,
that
you
can
do
that
with
a
prohibitory
injunction.
certainly
there
is
nothing
in
the
zenith
case,
and
certainly
nothing
in
the
silver
case,
that
would
reject
that.
the
second
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
this
distinction
between
prohibitory
and
mandatory
is
part
of
a
larger
distinction
that
is
really
the
one
that
is
the
ultimate
distinction
in
this
case,
between
conduct
on
the
one
hand
and
structure
on
the
other.
and
the
one
thing
that
is
undeniable
is
that
in
section
16
congress
referred
to
threatened
conduct
that
will
cause
loss
or
damage.
now,
the
only
answer,
the
only
answer
that
the
petitioner
has
to
that
language
is
that
what
they
really
meant
to
do
by
that
provision
was
to
incorporate
the
familiar...
requirement
of
the
familiar
restriction
that
you
have
to
show
that
you
are
going
to
suffer
injury
that
is
not...
that
is
not
redressable
by...
excuse
me,
for
which
there
is
no
other
adequate
remedy.
and
i
have
two
responses
to
that.
in
the
first
place,
that
just
isn't
what
the...
that
is
the
only
language,
that
is
the
only
explanation
they
have
for
that
threatened
conduct
language.
and
that
just
isn't
what
it
says.
if
congress
had
intended
by
that
language
to
prohibit...
to
incorporate
the
familiar
equitable
requirement
of
inadequate
other
remedy,
then
congress
would
surely...
would
have
said
so.
the
language
it
used,
threatened
conduct
that
will
cause
loss
or
damage,
just
doesn't
say
that.
moreover,
by
its
express
language,
section
16
does
incorporate
the
entire
package
of
equitable
remedies,
by
this
language:
"when
and
under
the
same
conditions
as
injunctive
relief
against
threatened
conduct
is
granted
by
courts
of
equity.
"
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me.
i
guess
i
misunderstood
your
honor
when
you
said
the
dissolution
of
the
pool,
as
opposed
to...
i
think,
while
that
is
not
this
case,
i
think
that
the
dissolution
of
the
pool,
the
actual
dissolution
of
the
pool,
as
opposed
to
what
the
ninth
circuit
referred
to
as
symptomatic
relief
prevented
the
individual
acts
from
occurring,
could
well
be.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
cannot
see
any
instance
in
which
prohibitory
relief
would
not
be
adequate
to
prevent
any
offenses--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--by
a
patent
pool.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
right.
that's
right,
and
any
acts--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--the
ninth
circuit
has
acknowledged
that
there
is
the
power
to
enjoin
the
actual
acts,
the
symptomatic
relief.
but
what
you
can't
do,
and
where
it
really
makes
a
difference,
is
in
the
merger
case.
i
don't
think
it
does
in
the
patent
pool
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
the
merger
case,
to
actually
dissolve
the
structure
itself.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
you
simply
prohibit--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
exactly.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
as
far
as...
well,
i
think
that
is
different.
in
the
case
of
the
patent
pool
you
simply
prohibit
the
future
enforcement.
now,
insofar
as
voting
the
stock
is
concerned,
i
think
in
most
instances
that
could
also
be
handled
through
a
prohibitory
injunction.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
pretty
close
to
divestiture.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course
he
can.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
and
those
also
can
be--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
he
can
get
an
injunction
to
sue
against
threatened
loss
of
injury,
and
he
can
sue
on
account
of
conduct.
but
the
distinction
that
is
drawn--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--by...
strictly
from
the
existence
of
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--of
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
and
if
there
is
one
thing
that
comes
shining
through
the
legislative
history,
and
i--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--not
wait
to
be
put
out
of
business,
but
wait
for--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--what
you
can
get
an
injunction
against
is
specific
practices,
such
as
improper
pricing,
perhaps
even
undue
concentration
in
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
am
not
sure
i
understand.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
justice
white--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--then...
then
it
would
have
been...
then
they
would
have
been
enjoining
conduct.
they
would
have
been
enjoining
an
act,
which
was
the
act
of
going
ahead.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
think
both
of
them,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
helpful,
and
the
conduct-structure
distinction
is
one
that
is
most
clearly
demonstrated
not
only
by
the
language,
because
it
does
talk
about
conduct,
but
also
by
the
legislative
history.
time
after
time
this
very
point
was
made
in
the
course
of
the
legislative
history.
probably
the
most
noted
example
was
the
exchange
between
messrs.
floyd
and
untermeyer,
in
which
mr.
floyd,
who
was
one
of
the
three
sponsors
of
the
bill,
said
we
did
not
intend
by
section
16
to
give
the
individual
the
same
power
to
bring
a
suit
to
dissolve
the
corporation
that
the
government
has.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
the
argument
that
our
opponents
make,
justice
o'connor.
i
submit
that
a
careful
and
objective
reading
of
not
only
the
legislative
history
but
what
was
happening
in
the
country
at
the
time,
just
completely
dispels
that
proposition.
there
are
so
many
evidences
that
the
word
that
was
used
at
that
time
for
any...
in
justice
brandeis'...
mr.
brandeis'
words
at
that
time,
change
in
the
status
of
the
corporation
was
dissolution.
the
most
frequent
example
that
the
legislators
used
in
referring
to
what
they
meant
by
dissolution
was
the
standard
oil
case.
and
in
the
standard
oil
case,
and
i
am
reading
now
from
pages
78
and
79,
the
language
is
very
clear.
it
commanded,
referring
to
the
district
court,
the
dissolution
of
the
combination.
dissolution.
and
therefore
in
effect
directed
the
transfer
by
the
new
jersey
corporation
back
to
the
stockholders
of
the
various
subsidiary
corporations.
what
they
did
in
the
standard
oil
case
was
a
classic
example
of
divestiture.
they
referred
to
it
as
dissolution.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
was
responding
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the
distinction
between
dissolution
and
divestiture.
and
the
point
is
that
dissolution
is
the
word
that
was
used
at
that
time
to
describe
any
kind
of
change
of
status.
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--possibly,
except
that
though...
the
only
difference
was
the
scale.
one
was
simply
larger
than
the
other.
and
i
think
any
doubt
on
that
subject
is
laid
to
rest
by
what
is
probably
the
closest
case
to
being
on
point
that
we
have,
which
is,
to
be
sure,
a
second
circuit
case,
but
i
offer
it
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
it
was
the
cambria
steel
case
written
by
judge
hand
a
short
time
after
the
clayton
act
was
passed,
and
it
involved
a
case
that
in
no
respect
is
distinguishable
from
this
one.
cambria
steel
was
a
small
steel
company
that
had
been
acquired
by
bethlehem.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i'm
not
sure
that
the
opinion
discloses
that,
justice
white,
whether
it
by
stock
or
asset
acquisition.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
how
did...
oh,
in
this
case
it
was
a
stock
acquisition.
minority
shareholders
of
the
cambria
company,
in
the
language
of
the
court,
sought
to
unravel
the
transaction
and
restore
to
the
cambria
company...
here
is
the
answer,
the
assets
so
taken,
so
it
was
an
asset
acquisition.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
what
judge
hand
said
was
that
this
simply
wasn't
an
injunction
suit
within
the
scope
of
section
16.
he
says,
and
i
quote,
the
suit
at
bar,
whatever
it
is,
is
not
a
suit
for
an
injunction.
indeed
it
is
really
a
suit
for
the
dissolution
of
a
monopoly
pro
tanto.
and
then
this
line:
"i
cannot
suppose
that
anyone
would
argue
that
a
private
suit
for
dissolution
would
lie
under
section
16
of
the
clayton
act.
"
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
justice
o'connor,
and
let
me
say
a
couple
of
things
in
that
respect.
the
first--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--oh,
i
have
no...
yes,
i
really
do
think
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind.
now,
whether
it
was
good
policy
or
not
is
a
debate
that
has
raged
from
1914
through
1975,
the
hart-scott-rodino
act.
brandeis
was
solidly
on
one
side
and
senator
nelson
solidly
on
the
other.
it
is
not
an
easy
policy
question.
and
as
you
can
see
from
the
amicus
briefs
that
have
been
filed
here,
it
involves
complex
issues
not
only
of
antitrust
policy,
but
labor
as
well.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
is
exactly
what
congress
intended.
and
i
would
simply
invite
the
court
to
those
exchanges
between
a
variety
of
people,
not
only
floyd-untermeyer
but
also
the
brandeis-carlin
exchange.
once
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--this
was
in
hearings.
once
the--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--on
the
senate
side
there
were
no
hearings,
justice
white.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
one
thing
that
happened
on
the
senate
side
that
is
significant
is
the
introduction
of
this
reed
amendment,
which
clearly
would
have
given
the...
excuse
me,
would
have
given
the
states
the
power
that
they
seek
here,
and
the
reed
amendment
was
rejected.
let
me
just
mention
briefly,
let
me
just
mention
briefly
the...
the
statement
by
mr.
brandeis.
the
clayton
act
was
a
major
initiative
of
the
wilson
administration.
and
this
boston
lawyer,
louis
d.
brandeis,
appeared
on
behalf
of
the
wilson
administration.
and
at
this
time
the
exchange
with
messrs.
carlin...
excuse
me,
with
messrs.
untermeyer
and
rogers
had
already
occurred,
in
which
they
had
said
you
ought
to
give
more.
and
specifically
would
it
not
have
helped
you
if
you
could
have
brought
suit
for
the
dissolution
of
the
trust?
this
section
only
gives
you
injunctive
relief.
and
then
mr.
carlin
said
to
mr.
brandeis
it
has
been
suggested
to
us
that
we
ought
to
give
the
individual
the
right
to
file
a
bill
in
equity
for
the
dissolution
of
one
of
these
combinations,
the
same
right
which
the
government
now
has.
and
here
was
the
response
by
mr.
brandeis:
"it
seems
to
me
that
the
right
to
change
the
status,
which
is
the
right
of
dissolution,
is
a
right
which
ought
to
be
exercised
only
by
the
government,
although
the
right
for
full
redress
against
future
wrongs
is
a
right
which
every
individual
ought
to
enjoy.
"
now,
a
couple
or
three
points.
one
is
that
this
statement,
like
judge
hand's,
shows,
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
that
the
word
that
they
used
in
those
days
was
dissolution,
and
indeed,
in
the
second
dupont
case,
this
court
observed
just
exactly
that.
that
dissolution
and
divestiture
are
largely
interchangeable.
they
have
been
over
the
years,
and
we
so
regard
them.
the
second
point,
and
even
more
important,
is
that
regardless
of
whether
you
call
it
dissolution
or
divestiture
or
anything
else,
it
is
the
change
in
status
that
we
are
talking
about.
and
there
is
no
question
that
there
is
a
difference
in
that
respect
between
what
the
federal
government
can
do
and
what
everyone
else
can
do.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
of
course.
of
course
the
government
can,
under--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--of
course
i
do.
of
course
i
do.
and
it
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
language,
because
the
language
is
not
only
broader,
but
even
more
important,
it
is
not
limited...
it
does
not
have
in
it
the
word
conduct.
and
you
do
not
have
behind
it
the
kind
of
legislative
history
that
you
have
here.
again,
i
repeat,
it
was
a
debate
that
raged,
it
was
an
intense
debate.
should
we...
one
of
the
metaphors
that
was
used
was
grinding
the
poor
defendant
between
the
upper
and
the
nether
millstones
of
the
federal
enforcement
on
the
one
hand,
and
then
once
he
finished
with
that,
then
he
has
to
go
through
another
gauntlet.
there
is
no
question
they
knew
what
they
were
doing.
and
what
they
were
doing
was
exactly
what
these
various
congressmen
responded
to
these
new
york
lawyers,
that
they
weren't
going
to
give
them:
the
same
relief
that
the
government
had.
that,
in
opposition
our
opponents
refer
to
one
legis...
one
piece
of
legislative
history
in
which
senator
nelson
did
use
the
words
same
relief.
what
he
was
really
saying
was
same
injunctive
relief.
in
fact,
those
were
his
exact
words.
the
same
injunctive
relief.
senator
nelson
in
fact
did
not
take
the
position,
and
he
knew
that
the
relief
was
not
the
same.
in
any
event
the
argument
proves
too
much
because
no
one
contends
that
the
two
are
the
same.
if
they
were
the
same,
then
the
states
would
have
criminal
prosecutorial
authority,
which
they
don't
have.
and
later
on,
in
connection
with
another
statute...
excuse
me,
with
another
section
of
the
statute,
senator
nelson,
who
would
have
liked
private
individuals
to
have
had
this
broad
remedy,
made
that
precise
point.
doesn't
it
strike
you,
he
said,
as
a
bit
unfair
that
section
16,
to
which
he
specifically
refers,
gives
this
right
of
injunctive
relief,
but
only
the
federal
government
has
the
broader
powers.
just
a
word
about
the
relevance
of
hart-scott-rodino.
it
was
an
amendment
to
the
clayton
act,
and
as
a
consequence
the
legislative,
the
legislative
history
of
the
hart-scott-rodino
act,
under
this
court's
decision
in
bell
v.
new
jersey,
is
persuasive.
by
that
time
we
were
using
the
word
divestiture
in
our
lexicon,
in
1976,
and
there
was
a
proposal
that
state
attorneys
general
be
given
this
divestiture
remedy.
and
chairman
rodino,
who
of
course
was
one
of
the
sponsors
of
hart-scott
rodino,
said
in
the
clearest
words
which
the
english
language
is
capable,
the
state
attorneys
general
should
not
be
authorized
to
file
parens
patriae
suits
seeking
divestiture.
now,
my
opponent's
answer
to
that,
his
only
answer,
is
that
chairman
rodino's
views
were
really
rejected
later
on
by
senator
hart.
the
citation
that
they
give
simply
do
not
support
that
proposition.
senator
hart
was
not
saying
anything
at
all
about
divestiture.
what
he
said
was
that
the
courts,
that
the
states
do
have
the
authority
to
bring
parens
patriae
suits,
and
that
that
is
sufficient
and
cites
in
support
georgia
v.
pennsylvania
railroad.
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
georgia
v.
pennsylvania
railroad.
it
is
a
decision
by
this
court,
and
of
course
obviously,
if
it
had
resolved
the
divestiture
issue,
then
we
would
not
be
in
this
court,
because
it
would
be
dispositive.
all
it
said
was
that
the
states
do
have
the
authority
to
bring
parens
patriae
suits.
that
is
what
senator
hart
said
was
sufficient.
he
did
not
say
anything
about
divestiture.
and
the
only
statement
on
that
comes
from
chairman
rodino.
just
one
final
point.
this
case
does
not
implicate
any
issues
of
federalism.
the
policy
issues
for
the
state
of
california
are
of
course
to
be
resolved
by
the
california
legislature.
and
if
the
california
legislature
really
wants
its
own
attorney
general
to
have
this
kind
of
power,
then
it
should
be
for
the
california
legislature
to
make
the
judgment.
those
are
just
as
difficult
policy
issues
today
as
they
were
in
1914,
as
they
were
in
1976,
but
they
should
be
resolved
in
the
initial
instance
by
the
california
legislature
and
not
by
the
attorney
general.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
questions
i
have
nothing
further.
