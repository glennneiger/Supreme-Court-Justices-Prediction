so,
in
light
of
your
answer
that
the
period
of
time
that
elapses
is
irrelevant,
i
take
it
then
it
is
unimportant,
other
than
for
the
way
it
may
bear
on
the
equities
and
the
court's
discretion,
it
is
unimportant
that
the
operational
aspects
of
this
merger
had
not
taken
effect?
justice
kennedy
well,
how
does
that
aspect
of
your
argument
work?
you
are
asking
us
to
see
whether
a
merger
has
been
completed
operationally?
we
don't
look
to
the
delaware
law?
justice
kennedy
well,
it
controls
when
the
merger
was
effective.
if,
by
hypothesis,
we
are,
we
do
draw
a
line
between
post
and
pre-merger
filings,
then
isn't
it
delaware
law
that
controls?
justice
kennedy
suppose
there
had
been
no
hold
separate
order,
but
the
operational
aspects
of
the
merger
just
hadn't
taken
effect
yet?
would
there
still
be
authority
of
the
court
to
order
a
divestiture?
justice
kennedy
so
what
is
it
that
we
look
to?
whether
or
not
the
operational
aspects
of
the
merger
have
been
completed?
justice
kennedy
but
i
am
asking,
assuming
we
disagree
with
you
on
that
point.
justice
kennedy
is
there
any
authority
to
guide
us
in
that
area?
