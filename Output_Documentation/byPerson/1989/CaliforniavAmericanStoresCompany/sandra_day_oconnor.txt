justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
horn,
i
guess
the
argument
made
by
the
other
side
in
part
is
that
at
the
time
congress
considered
this
question
and
adopted
the
statute
we
are
asked
to
examine,
that
there
was
generally
regarded
that
there
was
a
distinction
between
prohibitory
injunctive
relief
and
injunctive
relief
that
required
mandatory
action,
the
so-called
affirmative
injunction.
and
their
argument
is
that
congress
had
in
mind
only
providing
prohibitory
injunctive
relief.
now,
how
do
you
respond
to
that
argument?
justice
o'connor
now,
mr.
horn,
the...
the
order
here
was
one
to
hold
and
operate
the
stores
separately,
in
effect.
now,
that
is
some
kind
of
divestiture
order
in
your
view?
justice
o'connor
well,
they
argue
that
the
language
of
the
statute,
of
course,
is
that
the
relief
can
be
obtained
against
threatened
loss
or
damages.
justice
o'connor
which
could
be
interpreted
as
looking
to
the
future.
justice
o'connor
mr.
horn,
what
if
the
merger...
a
merger
has
taken
place
and
years
later
a
private
plaintiff
comes
in
and
seeks
divestiture?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
are
the
standards
in
your
view
for
the
private
plaintiff
to
get
a
divestiture
order?
justice
o'connor
as
opposed
to
injunctive
relief.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
private
plaintiff
has
to
show
antitrust
injury,
i
suppose.
justice
o'connor
you
are
reading
at
16
now?
justice
o'connor
well,
there
is
a
distinction,
perhaps,
between
dissolution
and
other
divestiture
orders,
and
maybe,
maybe
you
have
put
your
finger
on
what
it
was
that
really
bothered
the
legislators.
but
perhaps
it
didn't
bother
them
that
there
would
be
an
order
of
the
type
involved
in
this
case.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
lee,
in
your
view
the
acquisition
of
control
that
would
amount
to
an
antitrust
violation
of
another
company,
if
it
has
been
completed,
could
never
be
attacked
in
court
by
a
private
plaintiff
or
by
the
state
acting
under
the
same
statute,
if
it
has
already
occurred.
justice
o'connor
and,
of
course,
most
of
these
things
are
handled
before
the
state
or
a
private
person
would
know
it
is
going
to
take
place.
so
you
would
just
cut
off
that
remedy
all
together.
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
is
what
congress
had
in
mind?
