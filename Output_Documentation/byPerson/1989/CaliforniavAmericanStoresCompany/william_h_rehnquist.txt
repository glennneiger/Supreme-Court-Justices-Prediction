chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-258,
california
v.
american
stores
company.
mr.
horn.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
question
you
raised
in
your
certiorari
petition
is
whether
divestiture
is
within
the
provision
for
injunctive
relief
in
clayton
act
section
16.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we...
you
petitioned
on
two
questions,
but
i
had
thought
we
only
granted
on
the
first
question.
am
i
wrong
on
that?
the
only
question
you
have
in
your
brief
on
the
merits
is
divestiture
being
a
form
of
injunctive
relief.
chief
justice
rehnquist
one
of
the
arguments
that
the
respondents
make
is
that
section
15,
giving
authority
to
the
federal
government,
is
cast
in
different
and
they
say
broader
language
than
section
16.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
your
suggestion
is
that...
what
was
congress'
purpose
in
putting
the
authority
of
the
federal
government
in
different
language
than
that
of
the
private
people?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
horn.
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
rehnquist
could
the
state
have
gotten
an
injunction,
a
prohibitory
injunction
before
the
merger
took
place?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
some
of
these
distinctions
are
really
a
little
bit
evanescent,
i
think.
as
someone
has
pointed
out
from
the
bench,
i
forget
who,
a
distinction
between
a
prohibitory
and
a
mandatory
injunction
can
frequently
be
reversed
just
by
changing
the...
changing
the
syntax.
and
your
difference
is
between
conduct
and
structure.
one
may
be
enjoined,
the
other
not?
i
think
that's
a
rather...
blurred
at
the
edges
at
least,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
was
a
massive
divestiture
in
standard
oil.
it
wasn't
just
divesting
of
one
acquisition.
there
were
just
a
number
of
other
companies
involved,
weren't
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
my
point
was
that
one
could
have
described
the
standard
oil
decree
as
dissolution
without
feeling
it
would
necessarily
embrace
a
much
smaller
divestiture.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
mr.
horn,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
horn.
the
case
is
submitted.
