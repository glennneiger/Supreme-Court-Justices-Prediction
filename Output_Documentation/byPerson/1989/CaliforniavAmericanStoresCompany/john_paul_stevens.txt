justice
stevens
let
me,
before
you
leave
this
preliminary
point,
you
did
preserve
a
second
question
in
your
cert.
petition
which
i
thought
raised
the
question
whether,
on
its
own
merits,
the
whole
separate
order
could
be
sustained.
you
do,
you
ask...
your
second
question
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
by
reversing
the
preliminary
injunction
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
which,
it
seems
to
me
the
question
whether
the
whole
separate
order
itself
would
be
a
valid
form
of
relief,
even
if
you
could
not
get
divestiture,
is
still
before
us.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
lee,
the
government
doesn't
have
to
show
injury
to
itself.
justice
stevens
but
it
doesn't
have
to
show...
it
doesn't
have
the
standing
problem
that
a
private
litigant
has.
justice
stevens
but
you
know,
the
separate
language,
it
was
interesting
to
me
that
neither
side
quoted
section
15
in
the
brief.
and
i
suppose
the
reason
is
that
there
isn't
that
much
difference
between
the
two
sections.
justice
stevens
section
15
talks
about
prevent
and
restrain
also.
justice
stevens
not
the
whole
section.
justice
stevens
you
just
quote
the
jurisdictional
language.
go
ahead
anyway.
justice
stevens
the
language
is
to
prevent
and
restrain.
justice
stevens
and
you
think
that
clearly
authorizes
a
mandatory
injunction?
justice
stevens
but
the
relief
that
can
be
granted
is
to
prevent
and
restrain.
justice
stevens
and
that
is
the
language
you
say
clearly
differentiates
one
section
from
the
other,
and
one
allows
mandatory
and
the
other
does
not.
justice
stevens
well,
but
does
that
mean
there
is
no
jurisdiction
to
dissolve
a
patent
pool,
for
example,
or
to
require
the
stock
exchange
to
change
its
regulations
and
require
fair
hearings
and
that
sort
of
thing?
justice
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
you.
the
threatened
conduct,
what
is
the
threatened
conduct
that
would
justify
a
dissolution
of
a
patent
pool?
why
is
that
different
than
the
dissolution
of
a
business
enterprise?
justice
stevens
well,
what
is
your
position...
i
am
not
really
sure
i
understand
you.
what
is
your
position,
does
a
federal
court
having
an
antitrust
violation
having
been
proved
and
thinking
it
is
necessary,
one,
say
in
a
patent
case
to
dissolve
a
patent
pool,
or
in
a
motion
picture
case
to
set
up
competitive
bidding
instead
of
having
clearances,
does
the
court
have
the
power
to
do
that
or
not?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
not
an
answer
to
my
question.
justice
stevens
what
about
an
injunction
against
continuing
to
vote
the
stock
of
the
subsidiary?
justice
stevens
you
could.
you're
saying
that
would
be
a
permissible
form
of
relief
to
say
that
you
may
not
appoint
the
managers
or
vote
the
stock
in
the
acquired
company?
that
is
pretty
close
to
divestiture.
