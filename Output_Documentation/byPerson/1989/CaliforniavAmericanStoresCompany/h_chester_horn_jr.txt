mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
section
16
of
the
clayton
act
prohibits
a
district
court
from
decreeing
divestiture
of
a
supermarket
chain
in
california
acquired
in
violation
of
the
clayton
act.
the
issue
arises
from
the
attempt
of
the
american
stores
company,
the
parent
to
alpha
beta,
the
fourth
largest
supermarket
chain
in
california,
to
acquire
lucky
stores,
inc.,
the
largest
supermarket
chain
in
california,
the
acknowledged
low-price
leader,
for
the
purpose
of
merging
those
two
supermarket
chains
into
one
dominant
firm
controlling
25
percent
of
every
consumer
grocery
dollar
spent
by
california
consumers.
the
district
court
below
found
that
that
merger
almost
certainly
violates
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
the
district
court
found
that
that
merger
almost
certainly
threatens
irreparable
harm
to
california
consumers
in
the
form
of
several
hundred
million
dollars
per
year
in...
higher
grocery
bills
that
the
california
customers
will
pay
if
this
merger
is
allowed
to
be
completed.
the
district
court
therefore
entered
a
preliminary
injunction
which
it
found
necessary
to
preserve
the
remedy
of
divestiture
and
other
possible
relief
to
prevent
that
harm
from
occurring
if
it
found,
following
a
trial,
that
indeed
this
merger
does
violate
section
7
of
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
affirmed
both
sets
of
findings
by
the
district
court.
it
affirmed
the
finding
that
this
merger
likely
violates
section
7.
it
affirmed
the
district
court's
finding
that
this
merger
threatens
the
precise
harm
that
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
was
designed
to
prevent.
and
it
affirmed
the
district
court's
finding
that
california
had
made
an
adequate
showing
justifying
preliminary
injunctive
relief
on
the
record
before
it,
which
is
the
record
before
this
court.
but,
the
court
of
appeals
held,
based
on
its
prior
decision
in
itt,
that
the
preliminary
injunction
was
overly
broad,
solely
because
the
remedy
of
divestiture
is
not
available,
a
conclusion
it
reached
based
not
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
based
not
on
the
overriding
purpose
of
section
16
of
the
act
and
based
on
none
of
the
policies
underlying
the
substantive
provisions
under
the
act.
rather,
the
ninth
circuit
concluded,
based
on
a
fragment
of
the
legislative
history
which
was...
it
was
presented
with,
that
congress
did
not
intend
solely
to
provide
the
divestiture
remedy
to
private
litigants.
we
think
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
fundamentally
misinterprets
the
approach
prescribed
by
this
court
in
cases
like
porter
v.
warner
holding.
the
inquiry
ought
not
to
be
did
congress
intend
to
prohibit
a
particular
form
of
relief.
the
question
is,
by
granting
the
injunctive
powers
for
the
courts
to
remedy
antitrust
violations,
is
there
a
clear
and
valid
command
by
the
congress
to
preclude
that
relief.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
we
agree
with
american
stores
that
in
1914
the
distinction
between
prohibitory
and
mandatory
injunctive
relief
was
well
understood
by
the
congress.
and
if
congress
had
intended
to
limit
private
litigants
to
prohibitory
injunctive
relief
it
would
have
said
so
clearly
in
the
statute.
that
is
not
what
it
did.
it
provided
the
full
scope
of
the
injunctive
relief
to
prevent...
to
prevent
threatened
loss
or
damage
by
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
that
is
a
long
way
from
incorporating
a
distinction
between
prohibitory
and
mandatory
injunctive
relief.
and,
by
the
way,
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
ground
its
decision
on
that
distinction.
that
is
american
stores'
argument
to
support
the
ninth
circuit
rule.
the...
that
distinction
is
not
supportable
by
the
language
of
section
16.
i
think--
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
--well,
we
don't
think
so.
we
think
this
is...
the
order
that
was
crafted
by
the
district
court
is
a
straightforward
prohibitory
preliminary
injunction
maintaining
the
status
quo
and
preserving
the
possibility
of
all
available
remedies
following
a
trial.
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
--it
does
preserve
the
divestiture.
i
mean,
we
don't
dispute
that.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
i
disagree.
the
district
court
could
order,
following
a
trial,
a
permanent
hold
separate
of
these
two
supermarket
chains.
that
is
a
permanent
injunction
which
would
fall
squarely
within
even
american
stores'
reading
of
section
16.
it
would
be
prohibitory
only,
would
order
the
american
stores
to
operate
its
firms
independently
of
one
another,
and,
for
the
reasons
that
we
argued
in
the
district
court,
while
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
complete
relief,
we
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
effective
relief,
it
would
nonetheless
have
the
tendency
over
the
long
run
to
provide
some
relief
from
the
injury
threatened
by
this
merger.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
that
is
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
and
that
is
the
issue
that
we
present
because
we
do
agree
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
district
court's
preliminary
injunction
was
to
preserve
the
divestiture
remedy,
and
we
believe
that
the
divestiture
remedy
falls
squarely
within
the
authorizing
language
of
section
16
of
the
clayton
act.
and
i
would
like
to
turn
to
that.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
i
think
we
can
fairly
assume
that
because
of
the
district
court's
discussion
of
the
effect
of
the
federal
trade
commission's
hold
separate
order
from
its
tentative
consent
agreement
and
final
approval,
because
judge
kenyon
said
in
his
opinion
that
he
was...
it
would
be
a
matter
of
verbal
calisthenics
to
call
this
a
completed
merger
which
could
not
be
prevented
by
effective
injunctive
relief
at
the
permanent
injunction
stage
following
trial.
and
it
seems
clear
to
me
that
he
thought
he
had
the
power
to
order
the
sale
of
the
acquired
firm
if
he
felt,
at
the
conclusion
of
a
trial,
that
that
was
necessarily
effective
relief.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
i
think
that
is
right.
the
question
of
whether
a
permanent
injunction
ordering
the
permanent
holding
separate
of
these
two
firms
by
american
stores
would
be
an
available
remedy
following
trial
is
one
of
the
issues
we
presented...
is
still
before
you,
and
we
believe--
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
--i
understand
that,
justice
rehnquist,
but
the
petition
presented
two
questions.
the
order
from
the
court
granting
that
petition
granted
it
and
did
not
indicate
a
limitation
to
only
the
first.
in
the
brief
on
the
merits
we
did
recast
the
principal
issue
that
we
think
must
be
decided
in
this
case.
we
did
not
intend
to
discard,
and
our
reply
brief
preserves,
the
second
question
as
well.
turning
to
the
language
of
the
statute,
the
vehicle
congress
chose
in
1914
to
supplement
the
government
enforcement
effort
under
the
anti...
nation's
antitrust
laws--
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
--well,
if
anyone
was
misled
we
certainly
apologize.
that
was
not
our
intent,
either
to
mislead
or
to
indicate
that
that
issue
was
not
still
before
the
court.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
it's...
that
it
is
also
an
issue
which
is
fairly
subsumed
even
with
the
divestiture
issue
which
we
did
discuss,
because
the
ninth
circuit,
in
its
opinion
in
this
case,
concluded
that
even
the
preliminary
injunction
mandating
a
temporary
hold
separate
also
amounted
to
divestiture
under--
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
--well,
i
think
all
of
the
principles
which
we
will...
which
we
did
argue
and
are
arguing
today,
that
divestiture
is
available
or
applicable
to
the
indivestiture
portion
of
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
below
and
in
itt.
turning
to
the
language
of
section
16,
congress
provided
to
private
citizens
and
the
states
the
right
to
secure
injunctive
relief
against
threatened
loss
or
damage
by
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
we
believe
this
language
is
clear
and
that
each
of
the
three
elements
is
plainly
present
in
this
case.
first,
california
sought
in
its
complaint
and
the
district
court
found
that
divestiture
might
be
necessary
to
remedy
the
harm
threatened
by
this
merger.
secondly,
california
showed
and
the
district
court
found
that
divestiture
was
a
form
of
injunctive
relief
within
the
meaning
of
section
16
that
would
prevent
the
very
threatened
loss
that
section
7
was
designed
to
prevent.
and
third,
california
showed
and
the
court
found
that
the
injury
threatened
by
this
merger
was
that...
that
this
merger
was
a
violation
to
antitrust
laws
and
threatened
the
precise
injury
which
section
7
was
designed
to
prevent.
now,
in
light
of
american
stores'
argument
referred
to
by
justice
o'connor,
it
is
especially
important
to
note
two
things
about
section
16.
first,
congress
did
not
limit
section
16
relief
to
prohibitory
injunctions.
second,
congress
did
not
limit
the
section
16
to
injunctive
relief
directed
only
at
threatened
violations.
rather,
congress
was
focusing
on
injury
to
businesses
and
the
consumers
of
this
nation.
and
it
was
focusing
on
that
injury
whether
from
violations
which
were
completed
or
ongoing
or
would
occur
in
the
future.
and
there
is
not
a
hint
in
the
language
or
the
history
of
section
16
that
congress
intended
to
limit
that
statute
to
only
future
violations
of
one
of
the
substantive
provisions.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
clearly
it
does
look
to
the
future,
because
it
is
the
future
injury,
but
it
is
not
limited
to
injury
which
flows
only
from
future
acts
or
from
future
violations,
which
is
the
next
step
of
american
stores'
argument.
and
we
think
it
is
especially
important
to
note
that
congress
went
out
of
its
way
to
specifically
authorize
private
litigants
under
section
16
to
enforce
section
7
of
the
clayton
act.
that
is
important
because
in
1914
there
was
no
hart-scott-rodino
act.
there
was
no
securities
exchange
act
by
which
private
litigants
would
learn
in
advance
that
persons
were
about
to
make
acquisitions
which
would
violate
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
threaten
them
with
injury.
private
litigants
would
only
learn
about
mergers
violating
section
7
when
they
began
to
feel
its
effect,
long
after
the
stock
had
been
purchased.
and
congress
could
not
have
intended
to
provide
a
remedy
which
would
be
wholly
superfluous
to
the
very
provision
of
the
section
7
that
it
was
asking
section...
private
litigants
to
enforce.
a
more
natural
reading
of
the
statute
does
focus
on
the
threatened
injury
that
individuals
face
from
completed
violations,
or
irrespective
of
whether
the
violation
is
complete
or
not.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
my
first
response
is
that
it
is
not
broader
language.
if
anything,
section
15
of
the
act
is
the
language
which
speaks
of
preventive
language,
restraining
violations,
preventing
violations.
it
is
language
which
lends
itself
readily
to
the
suggestion
that
it
is
directed
only
at
future
violations.
but
for
100
years
this
court
has
recognized
that
that
statute
authorizes
the
government
to
seek,
and
the
district
courts
to
order,
the
relief
directed
at
completed
violations
and
affirmative
structural
relief.
section--
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
--the
principal
reason
for
it
is
because
section
16,
by
conferring
a
private
remedy,
needed
to
import
a
standing
limit,
and
that
is
why
we
have
threatened
injury.
it
is
a
standing
limit
which
the
government
has
never
been
required
to
show
for
it,
to
establish
its
rights
to
secure
relief
against
antitrust
violations.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly,
if
i
may,
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
clayton
act,
since
that
is
where
the
ninth
circuit
and
american
stores'
grounds
what
i
think
is
the
heart
of
its
argument
in
this
case.
we
know
that
congress,
in
1914,
knew
that
section
15
of
the
clayton
act...
or
the
sherman
act
predecessor,
had
given
the
government
the
right
to
both
prohibitory
and
mandatory
relief,
and
specifically
the
remedy
of
dissolution.
and
we
also
know,
by
careful
reading
of
the
debates
on
the
final
conference
bill
in
both
the
senate
and
the
house
in
1914,
that
those
two
bodies
were
told
by
the
floor
managers
of
this
bill
that
it
provided
the
very
same
remedies
under
section
16
that
the
congress
was
providing
to
the
government
in
section
15.
we
know
that
representative
webb
in
the
house
told
the
house
in
the
final
conference
debate
that
this
bill
was
as
strong
in
civil
remedies
as
it
could
be
made.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
that
cannot
be
true
if
the
most
effective
remedy
for
violations
of
section
7
was
not
being
provided.
we
think
it
is
clear
from
those
debates
on
the
conference
bill
that
the
full
scope
of
the
injunctive
powers
of
the
courts
was
conferred
on
the
courts
by
section
16.
the
only
portion
of
the
legislative
history--
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
--i
think...
i
think
that
the
answer
is
there
would
be
a
cause
of
action,
but
whether...
the
question
whether
it
could
survive
the
challenges
that
would
be
made
under
recognized
equitable
principles
such
as
laches,
clean
hands
and
the
rest,
would
be
extraordinarily
difficult
in
that
case.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
well,
if
the
specific
individual
bringing
that
suit
20
years
later
could
show
that
he
first
began
to
feel
the
effects
of
the
behavior
that
that
merger
conferred
on
the
offending
firm,
then
i
think
he
would
be
entitled
to
bring
the
case
at
that
time.
if
that
person
could
only
show
that
he
had
begun
to
feel
the
effects
20
years
ago,
and
sat
on
his
rights
for
20
years,
then
i
think
he
is
going
to
have
a
difficult
case
indeed.
but
that
does
not
go
to
the
availability
of
a
cause
of
action.
it
simply
goes
to
how
the
equitable
principles
would
be
applied
by
courts
to
address
it.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
i
don't
think
it
is
necessary,
but
i
happen
to
agree
that
that
is
correct.
it's
not--
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
--the
acquisition
has
happened.
but
the
injury
that
it
threatens
and
that
it
causes
is
continuing
and
continuing.
and
that
is
what
this
district
court
found.
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
found.
and
there
is
nothing
to
suggest,
in
the
language
of
section
16,
that
we
must
establish
an
ongoing
violation.
what
we
must
establish
is
that
there
is
ongoing
injury.
and
that
is
what
we
have
shown.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
read
the
statute
that
way,
justice
scalia,
with
respect.
the
statute
directs
district
courts
to
prevent
injury
caused
by
violations.
now,
i
agree
that
that
statute
can
be
and
should
be
read
to
give
the
district
courts
power
to
unwind
an
illegal
act
after
it
occurred
if
that's
the
effective
way
to
prevent
injury.
but
section
16
has
commanded
the
district
courts
to
design
relief
effective
to
prevent
injury
which
flows
from
violations,
and
it
matters
not
whether
they
are
completed,
past,
ongoing
or
threatened.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
i
think
it
is
unimportant
to
the
specific
question
whether
a
district
court
has
the
power
to
decree
divestiture.
i
think
it
is
not
unimportant
if
the
court
decides
to,
which
we
oppose,
but
if
the
court
were
to
buy
into
the
distinction
between
prohibitory
and
mandatory.
then
i
think
that
the
failure
to
bequeath
the
operational
aspects
of
the
merger
makes
the
availability
of
a
permanent
hold
separate
still
an
important
question.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
no,
i
don't
think
you
do
look
to
the
delaware
law.
i
don't
think
delaware
law
can
control
the
question
of
the
availability
of
relief
under
section
16.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy,
because
the
only
thing
that
the
delaware
law
did
was
it
enabled
american...
the
short
form
merger
provision
under
the
delaware
law
did
was
it
enabled
american
stores
to
acquire
the
stock
which
had
not
been
tendered
by
the
lucky
shareholders.
that
is
what
the
short
form
merger
provision
does.
and
the
hold
separate
order
was
entered
in
place
long
before...
or
not
long
before,
but
before
that
merger
law
was
activated
by
american
stores.
and
the
hold
separate
order
required
the
operational
separation
of
these
two
firms,
and
that
order
was
still
in
place
when
the
preliminary
injunction
was
entered.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
a
permanent
injunction
restricting
the
completion
of
what
the
whole
purpose
of
this
merger
was
the
integration
of
the
two
firms,
and
that
is
what
the
district
court
found
would
confer
on
american
stores
the
power
to
charge
higher
prices.
if
that
is
correct,
and
we
think
this
court
is
bound
by
those
findings,
then
a
permanent
order
separating
the
two
firms
is
available
relief.
in
conclusion--
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
well,
in
the
question
of
whether
divestiture
is
available,
i
think
that
is
not
a
relevant
inquiry.
i
think
that
if
we
are
addressing
whether
divestiture
is
available,
the
question
is
does
section
16
authorize
it.
we
believe
it
does,
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
even
the
operational
aspect
has
been
completed.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
then
i
think
they
would
have
had
to
have
complete
the
operational
aspects
in
order
to
preclude
us
from
divestiture.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
authority
which
has
specifically
addressed
that
question.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
highlight
one
important
feature
of
american
stores'
argument.
there
is
more
at
stake
in
this
case
than
section
7
or
the
availability
of
divestiture
in
this
case,
because
its
proposed
distinction
between
the
availability
of
prohibitory
and
mandatory
relief
under
section
16,
if
that
is
what
this
court
were
to
decide,
would
have
a
severe
impact
on
enforcement
of
all
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
antitrust
laws,
not
just
this
case
or
just
section
7.
it
would
require
this
court,
for
example,
to
conclude
that
a
person
facing
injury
from
the
inability
to
have
access
to
a
central
facilities
controlled
by
a
monopolist,
in
cases
like
otter
tail
or
associated
press,
is
entitled
to
no
relief
to
redress
that
injury.
it
would
require
the
court
to
conclude,
for
example,
that
persons
facing
ongoing
injury
from
violations
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act,
in
cases
like
zenith
and
silver,
are
not
entitled
to
affirmative
relief
to
redress
the
injury
that
they
face
from
those
violations.
this
court
has
rejected
those
arguments
in
zenith,
hazeltine,
otter
tail
and
associated
press,
and
we
think
they
must
be
rejected
here.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
then
i
think
that
is
very
much
like
the
itt
case,
which
was
the
genesis
of
this
rule.
and
i
think
that
the
private
plaintiff
would
have
a
cause
of
action
and
would
have
a
very
difficult
burden
perhaps
of
establish...
of
meeting
the
equitable
principles,
or
overcoming
the
equitable
principles
of
laches
and
the
rest,
which
would
entitle
him
to
specific--
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
--i
think
the
standards
are
whether
or
not
divestiture
is
the
relief
necessary
to
prevent
the
harm
caused
by
the
violation.
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
violation
is
completed
or
not.
the
question
is
is
it
necessary
to
prevent
the
injury.
the
district
court
below
found
in
this
case
that
it
was.
and
that
is
why
he
entered
the
injunction
preserving
the
divestiture
remedy.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining--
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
--i'll
be
glad
to
do
that.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
thank
you.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
scalia,
in
response
to
the
question
you
asked
me,
we
refer
to
the
second
issue
at
footnote
1
of
our
reply
brief,
because
that
footnote
discusses
whether
or
not
this
court
can...
must
reverse
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
below,
even
if
it
agrees
with
american
stores,
because
the
preliminary
injunction
which
judge
kenyon
entered
is
indisputably
prohibitory
and
it
preserves
an
indisputably
prohibitory
permanent
relief
of
a
permanent
hold
separate
order.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
in
response
to
several
questions
from
several
justices,
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
american
stores
agrees
that
this
court
has
decided,
in
cases
like
zenith
and
silver,
that
affirmative
injunctive
relief
is
available
under
section
16
of
the
clayton
act.
and
if
they
are
not
willing
to
go
quite
that
far,
they
clearly
agree
that
whatever
that
relief
was
it
could
be
characterized
as
prohibitory.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
is
just
like
those
cases
in
that
respect.
the
district
court
below,
following
a
trial,
could
readily
frame
a
prohibitory
injunction
prohibiting
american
stores
from
holding
the
stock
of
lucky
or
the
assets
of
lucky
acquired
in
violation
of
section
16
of
the
clayton
act.
it
is
probably
worth
remembering
here
that
when
this
court
decided
united
states
v.
dupont
one
of
the
things
that
this
court
noted
is
that
indeed
section
7
does
prohibit
not
only
the
acquisition
but
the
continued
holding
of
assets
acquired
in
violation
of
section
7,
and
that
is
how
the
decree
in
the
second
dupont
decision
was
actually
framed.
and...
so
the
difference
between
prohibitory
relief
and
mandatory
relief
is
not
going
to
get
american
stores
very
far
down
the
road.
and
it's
a
debate
which
really
ought
to
be
beside
the
point
under
section
16.
section
16
asks
the
district
court
to
prevent
injuries
that
face
individuals
and
businesses
from
violations--
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
that
was
a
lot
of
hot
air
at
all,
justice
white.
the
debate
which
american
stores
refers
to--
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
--but
the
debate
in
the
congress
in
the
early
stages
of
the
hearings
before
the
clayton
subcommittee
did
not
speak
to
the
difference
between
prohibitory
and
mandatory
relief,
except
with
a
minor
exchange
where
he
was
urging
that
mandatory
relief
ought
to
be
available.
and
it
is
important
to
note
about
those
early
exchanges
that
they
were
discussing
a
much
different
bill
than
was
ultimately
introduced
into
the
congress
and
passed
by
that
congress.
section
13
of
the
bill
that
was
being
discussed
in
those
exchanges
between
representatives
floyd
and
carlin
and
those
witnesses
was
going
to
amend
the
sherman
act.
and
it
was
not
going
to
add
the
new
substantive
provision
which
is
found
in
section
7,
which
was
ultimately
added
by
the
congress.
that
debate
focusses
on
a
proposed
amendment
giving
private
litigants
the
right
to
seek
injunctive
relief
against
the
trusts,
the
restraints
of
trade
violations
under
section
1
and
section
2.
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
and
that
is
precisely
right.
and
that
is
what,
that
is
what
mr.
brandeis
was
saying.
he
was
saying
that
the
ability
to
attack
these
nationwide
trusts,
like
the
ones
which
congress
was
so
upset
about
in
the
decrees
in
standard
oil
and
american
tobacco,
that
kind
of
attack
really
belonged
in
the
hands
of
the
federal
government.
but
no
one
at
that
point
was
yet
debating
what
relief
was
available
to
enforce
section
7
of
the
clayton
act,
because
that
bill
was
a
separate
bill
which
was
not
being
discussed
and
would
not
have
involved
section
13.
the
separate
bill
was
going
to
add
a
whole
new
provision
of
law
not
in
the
sherman
act,
creating
this
new
substantive
liability.
now,
it
is
important,
i
think,
to
again
remember
that
the
bill
that
ultimately
came
out
of
the
congress
now--
mr.
h.
chester
horn,
jr.
--i
don't
say
that
section
16
doesn't
give
authority
to
violate
the
trust.
i
say
that
congress
changed
its
mind
from
the
early
debate
in
february
of
1914
to
the
debate
on
the
conference
bill
when
senators
nelson
and
shields
made
it
so
perfectly
clear.
