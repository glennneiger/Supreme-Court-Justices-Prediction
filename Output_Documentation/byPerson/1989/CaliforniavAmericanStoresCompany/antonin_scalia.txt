justice
scalia
but
that
order
has
no
purpose
unless
the
court
has
the
power
to
order
divestiture.
i...
surely
you
acknowledge
that
that...
that
that
order
is
beyond
the
proper
discretion
of
the
court
if
the
court
cannot
order
divestiture.
right?
i
mean
it...
it
assumes
that
if
everything
comes
out
a
certain
way,
the
court
will
order
divestiture.
justice
scalia
and
has
no
other
purpose.
justice
scalia
do
we
know
that
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
the
district
court
had
in
mind?
justice
scalia
don't
you
think
you
should
have
done
that
in
your
first
brief,
just
out
of
courtesy
to
the
respondents
so
they
could
have
had
a
shot
at
it,
too?
i
mean
if,
you
know,
if
you
were
going
to
convert
this
into...
into
an
argument
over
a
permanent
hold
separate,
i
would
have
liked
to
hear
what
the
respondents
had
to
say
in
writing
on
the
point
too.
i
frankly
had
thought
that
that
was
out
of
the
case.
justice
scalia
you
don't
mention
it
in
your
statement
of
the
question
presented,
and
you
don't
mention
it
in
your...
in
your
principal
brief.
what...
what
else
is
one
to
think?
justice
scalia
i
agree
it
is
subsumed,
but
to
say
it
is
subsumed
is
not
to
say
it
need
not
be
argued.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
mr.
horn,
suppose...
suppose
an
acquisition
had
occurred
20
years
ago
that
forms
a
new
corporation
that
would
be
in
violation
of
the
clayton
act.
would
there
be
a
cause
of
action
for
divestiture
this...
at
20
years
later?
justice
scalia
well,
it's
a
monopolized
market.
i
mean,
it
turns
out
that
in
fact
there
is
not
as
much
competition
as
there
might
have
been
had
that
merger
not
occurred
20
years
ago.
justice
scalia
but
you
are
obliged
to
argue,
in
order
to
sustain
your
case,
that
whenever
there
is
an
acquisition
that
violates
the
act,
it
is
a
continuing
violation
that
extends
indefinitely
into
the
future.
because...
because
the
language
of
section
16
is
not
just
injunctive
relief
against
threatened
loss,
but
it's
injunctive
relief
against
threatened
loss
by
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
so
your
position
is
the
acquisition
is
not
the
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
your
position
is
the
continuing
operation
of
the
acquired
firm
jointly
is
a
continuing,
perpetual
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
that
is
necessary
to
your
case,
right?
justice
scalia
why
isn't
it
necessary?
i
mean,
that's
how
the
provision
reads.
it's
a
threatened
loss
or
damage
by
a
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
now,
if
you
say
the
only
violation
here
is
the...
is
the
acquisition,
that
is
past.
it
is
not
a
threatened
violation;
it
has
happened.
justice
scalia
you,
you
think
that
what
the
court
under
section
16
is
supposed
to
enjoin
is
not
the
violation
but
the
loss?
does
a
court
enjoin
loss?
that
is
very
strange.
i...
you
know,
i
would
read
section
16
to
say
what
it
provides
for
is
an
injunction
against
violation.
and
the
violation
is
the
acquisition.
justice
scalia
mr.
horn,
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time
looking
for
it,
but
when
you
get
back
up
will
you
tell
me
where
in
your
reply
brief
you
preserve
the,
or
you
argue
the
point
about
a
hold
separate?
i,
i
can't
find
it
at
a
quick
look.
justice
scalia
yes,
but
mr.
lee,
you
rely
heavily
on
a
distinction
between
prohibitory
and
mandatory
injunctions.
and
what
is
the
language
in
section
15
that
authorizes
a
mandatory
injunction
in
your
view?
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
where--
justice
scalia
--with
a
patent
pool,
mr.
lee,
isn't
there
a
continuing
agreement,
which
is
what
the...
you
know,
what
the
sherman
act
and
the
clayton
act
are
ultimately
directed
against.
combinations
and
agreements.
isn't
there
a
continuing
agreement
to
leave
the
patents
in
a
pool?
justice
scalia
that
is
the
violation.
and
that
violation
can
be
enjoined.
justice
scalia
but
when
there
has
been
an
acquisition
of
a
company,
there's
no
further
agreement
that
is
keeping
that
acquisition
in
effect.
well,
what
about--
--it's
in
effect
as
a
matter
of
property.
justice
scalia
very
subtle.
justice
scalia
that's
a
very
subtle
way
of
making
the
argument.
