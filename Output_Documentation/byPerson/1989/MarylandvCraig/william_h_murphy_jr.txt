mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
mr.
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
where
we
have
the
possibility
of
either
good
trauma
or
bad
trauma.
let
me
explain,
if
i
may.
bad
trauma
would
come
if
the
child
had
been
abused
and
the
defendant
were
guilty.
good
trauma
would
come
if
the
defendant
were
innocent
and
the
child
were
prevaricating,
fantasizing
or
being
coached.
query:
can
we
dispense
with
good
trauma
on
the
testimony
of
an
unlicensed
social
worker
such
that
there
is
no
possibility
that
the
presence
of
mrs.
craig
could
have
caused
that
child
to
jump
in
her
lap
or
to
say,
ms.
craig,
i'm
sorry,
i
know
you
didn't
do
anything,
or
to
have
a
demeanor
such
that
in
her
presence
the
jury
would
have
said
not
guilty,
we
don't
believe
the
child.
it
is
too
much
of
a
price
to
pay
that
what
my
brother
concedes
is
the
most
important
part
of
the
fact-finding
process,
face-to-face
confrontation,
be
stripped
away
on
the
theoretical
possibility
(a)
that
a
child
could
not
testify,
and
(b)
on
the
undemonstrated
fact
that
that
is
so.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
it
depends
on
what
the
beginning
assumption
is
for
the
process.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
if
the
defendant
is
innocent,
for
example,
it
requires
the
absolute
face-to-face
confrontation
to
help
bring
that
out.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
number
one,
the
proximity
of
the
witness
to
the
defendant.
this
is
especially
true
when
there
is
a
close
relationship
with
the
defendant
and
the
witness.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
yes.
in
other
words,
there
to
be
some
actual
face-to-face
opportunity
between
the
witness
and
the
defendant.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
i
don't
believe
so,
no.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
no,
i
don't,
not
that
part
of
what
they
said.
there's
much
that
they
said
that
i
agree
with,
but
not
that
part.
number
two--
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
--your
honor--
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
--yes,
it
is,
and
i
will
explain
why.
we
could
not
tell
from
the
test
developed
by
the
maryland
statute
or
the
procedure
followed
by
the
trial
judge
pretrial
the
basis
for
that
trauma.
that
trauma
may
very
well,
as
the
state
suggests,
be
from
the
fact
of
abuse.
on
the
other
hand,
it
could
be
because
that
child
was
so
chastened
by
the
presence
of
the
defendant
that
she
was
not
willing
to
give
false
testimony
in
the
defendant's
presence.
and
if
it
is
the
latter,
a
socially
desirable
result
has
been
reached.
if
it
is
the
former,
a
socially
undesirable
result
has
been
reached.
but
all
constitutional
rights
have
costs,
and
this
is
a
cost,
lest
we
throw
out
the
good
with
the
bad.
we
take
the
position
that
there
was
much
more
to
the
right
of
confrontation
than
was
permitted
in
this
case.
for
example,
the
jury
was
not
permitted,
because
of
the
way
that
the
cameras
were
focused
on
the
child,
to
see
whether
or
not
the
child
was
looking
to
the
prosecutor
for
guidance
as
to
how
to
answer
a
particular
question
or
whether
or
not
the--
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
any
such
objections
were
made.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
would
not
have
been
counsel's
right
to
object
if
the
child
looked
at
the
prosecutor
subtlely
or
if
the
prosecutor--
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
--on
the
other
hand,
though,
your
honor,
if
the
child
were
reacting
to
the
accused's
presence,
that
full
reaction
would
be
present
in
front
of
the
fact-finder.
there
was
no
opportunity
in
this
kind
of
encounter
for
the
child
to
react,
nor
was
the
judge
there.
many
children
will
respond
truthfully
when
they
see
the
black
robe.
they
have
an
equal
terror,
as
i
feel,
when
they
confront
the
judiciary--
[laughter]
--and
this
may
have
prophylactically
caused
the
child
to
change
her
entire
testimony.
that
was
gone.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
the
record
is
not
clear
about
that.
the
record
is
clear
that
the
child
was
brought
to
the...
and
this
came
out
in
the
motion
for
new
trial...
the
child
was
brought
to
the
courtroom
to
have
a
look
around,
a
procedure
which
i
think
is
good
but
no
substitute
for
having
to
determine
then
and
there
in
the
presence
of
a
black
robe
how
to
talk,
what
to
say,
whether
to
lie,
whether
not
to
lie.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
absolutely
not.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
that
is
correct,
nor
would
the
jury,
nor
would
co-counsel
sitting
next
to
ms.
craig,
nor
would
ms.
craig.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
that's
an...
that's
an
excellent
question,
your
honor,
because
he
would
not
be
able
to
rule.
he
would
not
know
firsthand
the
facts.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
that's
right.
and,
of
course,
if
the
cameraman
were
a
pro-prosecution
person,
he'd
corroborate
the
prosecutor.
and
so
there
would
be
no
way,
justice
o'connor,
that
if
counsel
made
an
objection
that
the
trial
judge
would
be
able
to
accurately
rule
on
firsthand
knowledge.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
in
this
case,
no.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
integrally
related
to
the
issue,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
any
balancing,
in
fact,
occurred
when
this
child
was
put
in
a
separate
room
away
from
the
court,
away
from
the
jury,
away
from
the
defendant.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
if
the
defendant
is
innocent
and
the
presence
of
the
child
could
have...
or
rather,
the
presence
of
the
defendant
before
the
child
could
have
provoked
the
kind
of
response
consistent
with
innocence,
the
truth-seeking
function
of
the
trial
has
been
ruined.
it's
like
going
into
exploratory
surgery,
if
it
pleases
the
court.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
if
i
can
make
an
analogy,
justice
o'connor,
we're
about
to
have
exploratory
surgery.
we
know
there's
a
tumor.
we
don't
know
where
it
is,
how
it's
implicated
with
other
organs
or
veins.
and
before
the
surgery
someone
takes
one
of
my
surgical
instruments
away.
he
takes
the
clamp.
i
might
be
able
to
say
in
advance,
if
i
knew
everything
that
was
going
to
happen,
that
that
clamp
wouldn't
be
necessary.
but
if
i
were
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
or
that
surgery
and
i
needed
that
clamp
and
i
didn't
have
it,
that
patient
would
bleed
to
death.
ms.
craig
didn't
have
the
clamp,
and
we
can't
say
that
had
she
had
the
clamp
the
result
would
have
been
the
same.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
if
that
were
so--
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
--there
have
been
conflicting
studies
about
the
impact
of
child
testimony.
unfortunately,
these
studies
are
flawed
the
way
that
the
state's
argument
is
flawed.
they
all
proceed
from
the
assumption
of
guilt,
and
no
one
has
studied
the
impact
of
good
trauma,
that
is,
the
trauma
that
comes
from
activating
the
child's
conscience
when
an
innocent
person
is
involved.
and
so...
and
to
answer
the
second
part
of
your
question,
i
would
think
that
whether
or
not
it
would
be
advantageous
to
a
cross-examiner
would
be
the
judgment
of
the
defense
lawyer
rather
than
the
judgment
of
the
court.
in
this
case
ms.
craig's
lawyer
adjudged
that
it
was
not
to
his
advantage.
he
did
not
want
this
procedure,
and
he
objected
to
it
fully
and
completely
all
the
way
down
the
line.
and
so
what
we
have
here
is--
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
--well--
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
--the...
the
question
remains,
then,
are
we
experimenting
at
the
expense
of
ms.
craig's
rights,
given
that
there
is
no
authority
in
support
of
the
experiment,
and
if
we
were
to
find
authority
later
which
said
it
was
a
bad
experiment,
what
happens
to
mrs.
craig?
and
so,
again,
all
of
these
discussions
and
questions
are
flawed
because
they
are
based
on
the
assumption
of
guilt
and
that
guilt
caused
trauma.
but
what
about
the
trauma
that
the
defendant
who
is
innocent
ought
to
have
the
right
to
inflict
because
he
is
innocent,
the
trauma
that
causes
the
child
to
back
away
from
previous
out-of-court
statements
or
direct
testimony?
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
we
can
look
at
200
years
of
jurisprudence
where,
on
occasion,
things
like
that
have
happened.
i
agree
that
we
cannot
predict
in
a
given
case
what
will
happen.
i
agree
that
a
social
worker
without
a
license
cannot
predict
whether
a
child
can
testify
or
not
or
the
impact
of
that
trauma.
it
is
because
we
cannot
predict
that
this
is
a
bad
experiment.
what
if
we
made
the
prediction
and
in
the
courtroom
where
there
was
a
chance
to
confront
there
was
recantation,
despite
our
prediction?
that
15-year
sentence
would
be
gone.
justice
would
have
been
done.
the
truth-seeking
function
of
the
courtroom
would
have
been
served.
it
is
not
served
when
we
made
an
assumption
of
guilt,
and
we
make
an
assumption
of
trauma
based
on
guilt
because
we
defeat
the
purpose
of
having
a
trial.
the
trial
is
to
winnow
the
innocent
from
the
guilty.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
i
agree.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
my
mother,
who
was
present,
and
my
father
who
is
a
member
of
this
court
who
argued
here
in
1952,
have
both
had
the
experience
with
me,
of
frightening
me
into
the
truth,
and
i
am
sure
that
they
would
not
dispense
with
that.
and
i
am
also
sure
that
there
is
an
analogy
that
can
be
made
with
people
who
have
close
relationships
with
children
who
are
then
accused
for
god
knows
what
reason.
those
people
have
the
ability
by
their
presence
to
confront
the
child
and
frighten
them
into
the
truth.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
yes.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
that's
asking
me
whether
i
prefer
the
devil
or
the
deep
blue
sea.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
which
kind
of
poison
would
i
ingest?
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
well,
i'd
reject
them
both,
your
honor,
and
that's--
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
--the
only
fair
answer
i
could
give
you.
[laughter]
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
yes,
i'd
prefer
the
slower-acting
poison
to
that
quick
fix.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
and,
your
honor,
i
think
much
of
that,
although
said
somewhat
in
jest,
is
true.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
no,
i
think
the
firmly
rooted
historically
acceptable
exceptions
ought
to
stay
with
us
because
they
deal
with
discrete
instances
of
reliability,
not
the
testimony
of
a
basically
unreliable
child...
and,
by
the
way,
the
younger
the
child,
the
more
the
child
needs
to
be
protected.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
well,
i'm
afraid
of
experimental
justice,
and--
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
--at...
at
a
great
cost
to
innocent
people.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
oh,
not
at
all.
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
when
an
experiment
is
tried
which
unnecessarily
takes
away
the
right
of
an
innocent
person
to
traumatize
a
witness
into
telling
the
truth
that
that's
too
much
of
a
cost
for
us
to
pay.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
on
the
other
hand,
many
cases
will
not
be
prosecuted
because
the
prospect
of
testifying
face
to
face
falsely
against
an
accused
will
be
too
much
for
a
child
witness
or
an
adult
to
bear.
constitutional
rights
have
some
costs,
and
one
of
those
costs
is
that
in
order
to
exhort
one
interest,
we
must
diminish
the
impact
of
another.
and
the
truth-finding
function
of
the
courtroom
is
the
highest
of
all
trial
interests.
although
there
are
times
we
dispense
with
it,
we
usually
do
that
in
the
interest
of
making
the
procedure
as
a
whole
even
more
fair.
but
to
deprive
a
defendant
of
one
of
the
fundamental
tools...
in
many
cases
the
most
important
tool...
to...
to
cause
a
witness
to
react
in
a
way
a
jury
might
find
incredible
is
taking
far
too
much.
i
doubt
if
thomas
jefferson
would
have
accepted
such
a...
a
radical
revision
of
our
trial
procedures.
and
incidentally,
child
abuse
cases
were
known
back
then.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
well,
let
me
pick
a
better
one.
[laughter]
let
me
pick
a
better
one.
i
think
one
of
the
framers
who
was
an
expert
would
have
known...
and,
indeed,
one
didn't
have
to
be
an
expert
to
know
that
face-to-face
confrontation
since
the
days
of
susanna
and
the
elder
or
earlier
works.
it
really
does.
susanna
would
be
in
the
lost
and
found
had
it
not
been
for
david's
insistence
that
the
pharisees
be
confronted
directly
with
their
accusations.
and
so
history
is
replete
with...
with...
with...
with
times
when
the
fact-finder
was
going
to
decide
against
the
accused
only
to
be
turned
around
when
there
was
a
full
and
fair
confrontation.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
your
honor,
you're
right.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
i
am
defending
three-quarters
of
the
judgment
below.
they
agreed
with
us
on
three
out
of
the
four
questions.
i
defend
those.
but
where
the
court
said
that
the
statute
was
constitutional
and
that
exceptions
to
the
rule
of
face-to-face
confrontation
could
be
made,
no,
i
do
not
defend
that
holding.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
yes.
i...
i...
i
support
that.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
i
do
not
support
that.
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
that...
that...
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
incidentally,
the
balancing
that...
assuming
for
the
aske
of
discussion
that
this
court
decides
that
the
right
is
not
absolute.
the
balancing
that
the
sixth
amendment
requires
was
not
made
in
this
case.
no
discussion
at
all,
no
consideration
at
all
was
made
about
whether
two-way
television
would
have
been
acceptable
to
the
psychologists
or
to
the
social
worker
in
this
case
as
an
alternative
to
one-way.
and
there
at
least
the
child
would
have
had
some
opportunity
to
see
through
the
camera
at
the
face
of
the
defendant.
we
don't
know
whether
the
child
would
have
reacted
to
that
as
fantasy
or
whether
he
would
have
had
the
same
emotional
impact
that
face-to-face,
in-the-flesh
confrontation
would
have
had,
but
it
would
certainly
have
been
better
than
eliminating...
stripping
the
right
that
miss
craig
had
to
be
seen
by
the
child.
and
so
because
maryland
didn't
attempt
even
to
balance
that
interest,
the
judgment
ought
to
be
reversed,
because
we
cannot
take
away
any
more
of
mrs.
craig's
sixth
amendment
rights
than
is
necessary
on
a
fact-specific
basis
to
protect
that--
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
--only
that
part
of
the
judgment
which
we--
mr.
william
h.
murphy,
jr.
--that
is
correct,
judge.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
have
concluded
my
presentation.
