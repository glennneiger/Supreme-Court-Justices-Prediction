justice
white
but
each...
each
psychiatrist
just
testified
about
a
single
child
or--
justice
white
--but
did
they
all
testify
about
all
the
children?
justice
white
so
it
sounds
like
there
was
only
one...
one
expert
for
each
child,
is
that
it?
justice
white
okay.
justice
white
all
right.
thank
you.
justice
white
well,
which
is
it...
which
is
it...
which
is
it,
just
the
trauma,
or
is
it,
as
you
suggested
a
minute
ago,
the
functional
unavailability?
justice
white
well,
suppose
there's
plenty
of
trauma
but
you
could
not
conclude
that
there
was
functional
unavailability?
justice
white
well,
what's
so
unusual...
what's
so
bad
about
what
the...
your
court
of
appeals
did,
it
said
that
if
you
want
to...
if
you
want
to
avoid
having
the
child
testify
in
the
courtroom,
you
ought
to...
you
ought
to
test
it
out...
test
them
out
ahead
of
time.
justice
white
well,
yeah.
it
may
be...
it
may
be
that
there'd
be
a
lot
of
trauma,
but
it
may
be
that
they
could
testify.
justice
white
and
all
you
talked
about
is
that
what
you're
trying
to
avoid
would...
would
be...
would
happen
in
the
dry
run,
but
you're...
you're
really
after
more
than
just
avoiding
trauma.
justice
white
all
right.
what
if
there
is
a
severe
emotional
distress
but,
nevertheless,
they...
they
could
testify?
justice
white
well,
why
not...
why
not
test
that
out
ahead
of
time?
justice
white
i
know,
but
you
don't...
you
don't
want
to...
you
just
seem
to
me
to
concede
that...
that
severe
emotional
distress
would
not
be
enough
to
excuse
the...
to
excuse
them
from
testifying
in
the
courtroom.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
exactly.
so
severe
emotional
distress
is
not
enough.
you've
got
to
have
functional
unavailability.
justice
white
you're
familiar
with
the
case
that's
going
to
follow
yours?
justice
white
idaho
against
wright?
justice
white
which
would
you
prefer,
the
maryland
procedure
or
the
idaho
procedure?
justice
white
exactly
right.
[laughter]
you're
quite
right.
quite
right.
which
would
you
like?
which
would
you
prefer?
justice
white
exactly,
exactly.
justice
white
i
know.
justice
white
i
know.
but
suppose...
suppose
we
agreed
with
idaho
in
the
next
case.
i
would
suppose
you
would
rather
go
with
the
maryland
procedure.
justice
white
exactly,
exactly,
exactly.
justice
white
functional,
but...
i...
i
take
it
that
you...
you
don't
think
there's
room
for
much
hearsay
at
all
in
a
criminal
trial.
justice
white
well,
the
maryland
court
would
prevent...
would
permit
a
new
trial?
justice
white
well...
but
would
permit...
would
permit
a...
would
permit
a
trial
with
these
witnesses
if
the
procedure
that
the
court
specified
was
followed?
justice
white
i
know
you
don't,
but
the...
but,
of
course,
you
didn't
cross...
you
didn't
cross
there.
