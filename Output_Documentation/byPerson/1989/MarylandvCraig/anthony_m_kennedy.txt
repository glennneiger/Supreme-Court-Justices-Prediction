justice
kennedy
was
the
defense
objection
simply
to
not
having
the
child
in
the
courtroom,
or
did
the
defense
make
the
supplemental
objection
that
it
wanted
the
child
at
least
present
in
the
videotaped
room...
in
the
videotaping
room?
justice
kennedy
did
the
child
see
the
judge
before
the
videotaping
began?
justice
kennedy
well,
you're
proceeding
on
the
assumption
that
veracity,
credibility
is
always
better
tested
with
the
child
witness
when
that
child
witness
is
in
a
big
courtroom
facing
the
defendant
and
the
judge.
and
i
think
you're
correct
that
that
is
the
thrust
of
our
jurisprudence.
but
is
there
any
modern
studies
which
bear
you
out
or
which
discuss
this?
i...
i
should
think
that
some
trial
attorneys
would
find
it
much
easier
to
cross-examine
a...
to
cross-examine
the
child
in
an
environment
where
very
few
people
are
present
and
where
just
the
camera
is
present.
justice
kennedy
have
there
been
any
studies
on
that?
justice
kennedy
well,
of
course,
you're
asking
us
to
make
an
assumption
that
in
all
or
most
cases
the
truth-seeking
function
is
better
served...
and
i'm
just
pointing
out
that
i...
i
don't
believe
there
is...
that's
necessarily
borne
out
by
modern
scholarship
with
respect
to
videotape.
justice
kennedy
i
agree
that
the
thrust
of
the
jurisprudence
in
on
your
side.
justice
kennedy
well,
of
course,
again,
there's
an
assumption
that
trauma
will
bring
out...
bring
out
the
truth.
it
may
be
that...
that
trauma
will
reinforce
the
child
in...
in
a
fabrication.
i...
i
know
of
no
evidence
for
one
proposition
over
the
other.
justice
kennedy
was
that
the
same
day?
justice
kennedy
did
the
judge
swear
the
child?
justice
kennedy
in
the
presence
of
the
judge?
justice
kennedy
--except
that
you
can
see
the
reaction
of
the
witness...
of
the
defendant
as
she
watches
the
testimony
unfold.
the
jury
can
watch
the
defendant's
reaction.
