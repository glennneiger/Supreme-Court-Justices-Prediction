justice
stevens
general
curran,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
maryland
statute?
justice
stevens
if
the,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
in
her
question,
the
test
seems
to
be
whether
the
child
could
testify
in
the
courtroom
rather
than
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant,
and
if
there
were
a
finding
that
the
child
could
not
testify
in
the
courtroom
and
had
to
testify
in
a...
over
tv,
and
if
the
defendant
had
represented
herself
rather
than
having
counsel,
would
the
proceeding
have
gone
forward
in
the...
by
television
with
the
defendant
confronting
the
child
and
doing
the
cross-examination
herself?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
clarify
one
thing.
under
the
statute,
the
judge
is
not
in
the
room
with
the
witness,
is
he?
justice
stevens
so
the
judge
wouldn't
be
able
to
observe
what
exactly
or
how
the
prosecutor
was
behaving?
justice
stevens
how...
how
under
that
procedure
would
the
judge
rule
on
an
objection
such
as
justice
o'connor
has
suggested?
say
he
objected
to
nodding
his
head.
what
would...
how
would
the
judge
rule
on
it?
justice
stevens
say
the
prosecutor
denied
that
he
did
it.
how
would
the
judge
know?
