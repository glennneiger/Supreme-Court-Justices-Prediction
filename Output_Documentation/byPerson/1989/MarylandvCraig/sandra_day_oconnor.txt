justice
o'connor
general
curran,
i
thought
that
the...
the
trial
court
finding
was
made
in
accordance
with
the
language
of
the
statute
in
maryland,
that
the
testimony
of
each
of
the
children
in
a
courtroom
would
result
in
the
child
suffering
serious
emotional
distress,
and
that
the
children
could
not
reasonably
communicate
in
a
courtroom?
now
that
was
the
finding
that
was
made?
justice
o'connor
all
right.
now,
is...
is
it
necessary
that
the
focus
be
on
whether
the
children
could
testify
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
may
well
be,
but
was
that
the
finding
of
the
trial
court?
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
there
may
well
have
been
evidence
in
the
record
that
would
have
permitted
the
trial
judge
to
make
a
different
finding,
but
it's
not
the
finding
the
trial
judge
made,
is
it?
justice
o'connor
does
that
mean
we
must
affirm
the
judgment?
justice
o'connor
well,
but
you
don't
want
us
to
make
that
finding,
that
the
trial
court
should
have
made,
do
you?
justice
o'connor
now,
the
court
below
ordered
a
new
trial.
do
you
think
that
the
court,
under
maryland
law,
might
have
sent
it
back
to
the
trial
court
to
consider
whether
the
trial
court
would
make
a
different
finding?
justice
o'connor
well,
general
curran,
i
suppose
it's
possible
that
a
rape
victim,
as
justice
scalia
mentions,
or
even
a
victim
of
some
mafia-type
crime,
and
an
adult,
could
be
so
terrified
to
testify
that
it
would
be...
perhaps
the
same
finding
could
be
made.
would
you
think
a
state
could,
under
those
circumstances,
adopt
a
similar
rule?
justice
o'connor
or
an
elderly
crime
victim.
justice
o'connor
i'm
just
asking
you
whether
you
think
the
confrontation
clause
would
preclude
a
state
rule
to
protect
such
adult
witnesses?
justice
o'connor
the
functional--
justice
o'connor
--unavailable?
justice
o'connor
well,
were
any
objections
made
by
the
defense
counsel
to
any
action
by
the
prosecutor
when
the
witness
was
questioned?
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
reflect
that
the
defense
counsel
said
now,
your
honor,
i
object,
the
prosecutor
is
nodding
the
head
to
indicate
what
the
child
should
answer?
was
there
anything
like
that?
justice
o'connor
no.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
counsel
could
surely
object
if
the
prosecutor
were
by
conduct
trying
to
indicate
to
the
child
how
the
child
should
respond.
justice
o'connor
were
there
other
people
in
the
court...
in...
in
the
room
with
the
child
when
she
testified
who
can
themselves
testify
if
it
became
necessary--
justice
o'connor
--because
this
is
certainly
off
on
a
strange
tack
now
that's
far
removed
from
the
issue
here,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
assuming
that
a
trial
court
is
able
to
make
a
specific,
a
case-specific
finding
that
the
child
witness
cannot
testify
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant,
how
is
the
truth-seeking
function
impeded
there?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
the
evidence,
for
example,
shows
that
the
child
witness'
testimony
might
be
more
reliable
in
the
absence
of
the
defendant's
immediate
presence
and
there
is,
after
all,
the
right
of
cross-examination,
which
we
have
always
thought
was
crucial
in
terms
of
reaching
the
truth,
the
witness
is
still
under
oath,
the
jury
and
the
defendant
still
see
the
witness
in
a
very
direct
way
on
the
screen.
now,
under
those
circumstances
isn't
it...
isn't
the
truth-seeking
function
still
attained?
justice
o'connor
mr.
murphy,
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
don't
defend
the
judgment
of
the
maryland
court,
that
you
would
never
permit
under
any
finding
the
procedure
that
maryland
has
devised
for
youths?
justice
o'connor
so
you're
not
defending
the
judgment
below?
justice
o'connor
you
argued
that--
--you
don't
mean
that...
you
don't
mean
that
the
judgment
of
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed,
do
you?
