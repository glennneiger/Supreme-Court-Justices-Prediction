chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-478,
maryland
against
sandra
ann
craig.
general
curran.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
this
was
presented
live
to
the...
in
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
general
curran.
mr.
murphy,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
murphy,
what...
what
do
you
think
the
sixth
amendment
confrontation
clause
requires
in
a
case
like
this
where
you've
got
small
children
as
witnesses?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i'm
asking
you
what
you
think
our
law
requires.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well...
where
we're
talking
about
a
confrontation
clause
requirement
in
the
context
of
a
trial
where
the
defendant
is,
of
course,
attended
by
the
presumption
of
innocence.
will
you
tell
me
what
you
think
the
requirements
of
the
confrontation
clause
are
in
a
situation
like
this?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
proximity
in
the
courtroom?
chief
justice
rehnquist
can
that
never
be
dispensed
with?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
don't
agree,
then,
with
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
your...
your
position
is
that
if
one
of
these
child
witnesses
has
been
put
through
the
procedure
stated
by
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
and
is
given
a
trial
run
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant,
the
witness
is
functionally
unable
to
testify,
that's...
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
that
that
witness
will
not
be
heard
from?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
your
position?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
those...
those...
those
instances
of
historical
exceptions
to
the
hearsay
rule
didn't
devolve
all
at
one
time.
they
evolved
exception
by
exception
over
a
period
of
time.
what
you're
saying
is
that
no
more
may...
may
there
be
any
evolution.
we
freeze
everything
the
way
it
was
at
a
certain
time.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
hearsay...
the
hearsay
rule
in
its
evolution
over
the
centuries
was
experimental.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
are
you
saying
that
the
entire
rules
of
evidence
should
be
frozen
as
of
1787?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
your...
your...
your
position
is
that
these
kind
of
crimes
that
are
involved
here
simply
in
many
cases
will
not
be
prosecuted
because
the
rules
of
evidence
will
be
too
strict
to
ever
allow
the
witnesses
who
know
most
about
the
thing
to
tell
their
version
to
the
jury.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
think
thomas
jefferson
was
an
expert
on
trial
procedure?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you...
you
have
to
cross-appeal
to...
to
obtain
that
result.
all
you
can
argue
for
here
is
an
affirmance.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
murphy.
mr.
curran,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
curran.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
