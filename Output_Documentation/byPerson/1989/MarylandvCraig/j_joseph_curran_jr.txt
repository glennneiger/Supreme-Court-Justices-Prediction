mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
this
morning
is:
was
sandra
craig
denied
her
right
of
confrontation
when
our
trial
judge
allowed
four
child
victim
witnesses,
aged
four,
five
and
six,
to
testify
at
the
trial
by
way
of
a
one-way
closed
circuit
television,
a
procedure
that
had
been
authorized
by
the
maryland
statute?
or
was
the
right
to
confront
satisfied
because
the
children,
who
were
determined
to
be
functionally
unavailable,
testified
under
oath,
were
the
subject
of
unrestricted
cross-examination
and
were
able
to
be
seen
by
the
judge
and
the
jury
on
the
monitors
as
to
their
credibility
and
reliability?
permit
me,
if
i
might,
share
with
you
the
facts
in
our
case.
in
the
fall
of
1986
mrs.
craig
was
charged
with
several
counts...
several
instances
of
sexual
and
physical
child
abuse.
prior
to
the
trial,
in
march
of
1987,
the
trial
court
held
a
two-day
motion
hearing
on
whether
or
not
the
section
of
our
statute
should
be
implemented
permitting
the
use
of
the
one-way
closed
circuit
television.
at
that
two-day
hearing,
five
separate
experts
were
called
who
testified
in
child-specific
detail
as
to
their
recommendations
and
their
opinions
as
to
whether
the
children
would
be
able
to
testify
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant,
or
whether
they
would
be
better
able
to
testify
out
of
the
presence
of
the
defendant,
by
way
of
our
procedure.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
no,
justice,
there
were
five
different
experts.
and
i
might
add
there
were
psychologists,
child
therapists--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--no,
sir,
only
those
children
that
they
had
under
therapy
for
several
weeks...
several
months.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
well,
in
truth,
one
expert
had
three
children.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
another
had
two.
and
the
others
had,
as
i
recall,
one
each.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
but
no
one
had...
had
everyone.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
in
truth,
justice
o'connor,
if
you
will
review
the
joint
appendix,
you
will
find
that
each
of
the
five
experts,
when
testifying
about
their
respective
child
patient,
testified
with
specificity
that
it
was
the
presence
of
mrs.
craig
that
they
were
seriously
emotionally
distressed
by.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
the
trial
court,
justice,
as
you
rightly
observe,
did
in
fact
track
the
exact
words
of
the
statute--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--and
found
that
the
children
testifying
in
the
courtroom
were
deemed
by
may
to
be
seriously
emotionally
distressed.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
i
conclude
you
are
right,
justice
o'connor.
but
i
want
to
emphasize--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--no,
but
i...
yes.
no...
no,
i
don't
want
to
affirm
the
judgment.
no,
excuse
me.
[laughter]
i
want
to
invite
you
to
review
the
entire
testimony
of
all
of
the
experts,
both
on
direct
and
cross--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--well,
i
suggest
to
you,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
trial
judge
conclusion
was
based
solely
on
the
testimony
of
the
experts
that
talked
solely
about
mrs.
craig,
and
not
about
the
courtroom.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
that
is
not
necessary
in
our
opinion.
we...
we
believe,
and
state
in
our
brief,
that
the
court
below
made
a
misreading
of
your
decision
in
coy,
requiring,
in
their
belief,
that
coy,
before
permitting
our
section
9102
to
be
implemented,
would
require
that
there
be
a
face-to-face
confrontation
between
the
victim
and
the
defendant,
either
in
person
or
by
the
two-way
television,
before
you
could
use
that
procedure.
we
disagree.
we...
we
believe
very
strongly
that
the
court
below
has
simply
misread
your
finding
in
coy.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
the
defense
objection,
which
was
continuing,
i
will
tell
you,
justice
kennedy,
was
that
the
children,
out
of
the
presence
of
the
defendant,
violated
her
sixth
amendment
right
to
confront
the
accuser.
and
our
procedure,
once
the
court
heard
from
the
expert
witnesses,
permitted
the
children
to
be
seen
out
of
the
courtroom
in
the
judge's
chambers,
and
i'll
just
share
with
you
briefly
the
procedure,
in
the
judge's
chambers
was
the
child
witness,
was
the
prosecutor,
was
the
defense
attorney,
who
was
permitted
to
do
all
the
cross-examination
that
was
desired,
and
of
course
the
tv
technician
person.
out
in
the
courtroom
was
the
judge,
the
jury
and
the
defendant
with
her
counsel,
and
there
were
the
two
tv
monitors
in
which
the
jury
and
the
other
spectators
and
the
defendant
could
see--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--yes,
justice.
this
was
as
it
happened.
it
was
live
as
the
witness
was
cross-examined
or
examined.
and
there
was
the
audio
in
which
the
judge
and
the
jury
could
hear
and
could
at
the
same
time
see
the
actual
presentation.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
it
could
have
been
a
videotape.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
our
procedure--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--justice,
it
was
a
picture
of
the
child's
face
and
upper
body.
it
did
not
show
the
other
part
of
the
judge's
chambers.
nor
did
it
show
the
prosecutor
or
the
defendant's
attorney.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
the
jury
only
observed
on
the
monitors
the
child--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--and
heard,
justice
scalia,
heard,
of
course,
the
questions
from
mr.
kolodner
or
from
kate
o'donnell,
the
prosecutor
who
was
present.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
the
available
punishment
was
15
years.
the
punishment
in
this
case
was
10
years.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
in
truth,
justice,
none
were
psychiatrists.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
dr.
sweeney
was
a
licensed
psychologist,
who
had
worked
for
a
period
of
time
at
the
johns
hopkins
division
of
psychiatry,
but
she
was
indeed
a
psychologist.
the
others
were
licensed
social
workers,
and
one
was
a
child
therapist.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
with
all
due
respect,
justice,
the...
the
facts
will
also
demonstrate
that
there
was
in
addition
to
the
child
testifying
as
to
what
happened
to
her,
there
was
the
testimony
of
dr.
charles
shubin,
a
child
clinical
pediatrician
who
documented
physical
findings
of
scarring
in
the
private
areas
of
these
children,
and
that
was
not--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--it
was
based
on
the
testimony
before
judge
kane,
the
trial
judge,
that
this
expert
witness
who
he
qualified
based
on
weeks...
20...
the
record
will
show
in
some
cases
20
therapy
visits
and
in
another
case
36
visits.
so
you're
not
talking
about
an
isolated
visit.
you're
talking
about
a
long
continuum
of...
of
therapy,
and
they
stated
in
one
case
the
child
would
regress
if
has...
have
to
face
this
particular
defendant
after
they
had
taken
this
therapy.
bear
in
mind,
justice,
they
were
four,
five
and
six
years
of
age
at
the
time
they
were
called,
and--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--we're
asking
the
court
to
determine
was
the
confrontation
right
that
all
of
us
have
under
the
sixth
amendment,
the
guarantee
of
a
fair
trial,
was
that
satisfied
by
this
procedure,
bearing
in
mind
the
jury
saw
the
child
take
the
solemn
oath,
the
jury
saw
and
heard
the
extensive
cross-examination,
and
the
jury
could
assess
the
child's
facial
expressions
and
responses.
so
the
only
thing
that
was
absent
was
the
physical
presence
of
a
child
sitting
in
the
courtroom
several
feet
away.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
and
the--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--our
position
in
that
regard,
justice
scalia,
is
that
there
was
this
finding
based
on
this
testimony
that
the
children
were
unavailable.
they
were
functionally
unavailable
as
we
talked
about
in
the
roberts
case,
and
if
there
is,
in
fact,
testimony
that's
unavailable...
and,
of
course,
in
our
case
if
the
testimony
is
unavailable,
there
is
no
evidence,
there
is
no
truth-determining
faction
or
function
for
the
jury
to
determine,
and
there's
no
trial.
that's
our
dilemma.
absent
these
procedures
where
there
can
be
a
careful
analysis
of
the
expert
testimony
and
if
believed...
now
bear
in
mind
there
was
no
request
to
have
other
experts,
i
might
add,
justice
scalia.
there
was...
there
was
our
experts...
and
the
judge
was
satisfied
that,
based
on
the
testimony,
these
children
were
seriously...
would
be
seriously
emotionally
distressed
such
that
they
could
not
reasonably
communicate...
i.e.,
unavailable,
i.e.,
no
evidence,
no
truth-seeking
determination
and
no
trial
in
our
case.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
i'm
sorry.
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
our
statute
does
not
permit
that,
your
honor.
if
the
defendant
chose
to
represent
herself,
then
we
could
not
use
section
9102,
and
that's...
that's
spelled
out
in
the
statute.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
we...
we
can
only
use
it
when
there's
counsel
involved
and
only
use
it
when
there
has
been
a
finding
of
functional
unavailability.
the
court
verdict
was
in.
several
months
later
there
was
a
motion
for
new
trial,
at
which
time
this
whole
issue
was
argued
again
before
judge
kane.
judge
kane
again
had
the
opportunity
to
reexamine
all
of
the
evidence
that
had
come
forward...
the
competency
hearing
that
he
conducted
when
he
saw
the
children,
all
of
the
expert
testimony,
the
dr.
shubin
testimony,
other
witnesses
who
confirmed
statements
made
by
the
children...
and
held
that...
in
hindsight
he
reaffirmed
his
position
that
the
use
of
the
statute
in
this
circumstance
was
permitted
and
was
appropriate.
our
court
of
special
appeals
affirmed
that
decision.
our
court
of
appeals,
our
highest
court,
reversed,
and
they
reversed,
justices,
on
the
basis
of,
as
they
read
your
decision
in
coy:
"we
find
that
the
trial
court
did
not
reach
that
high
threshold
required
by
coy.
"
and
that's
where
we
differ,
and
that's
where
we
part
because
we...
we
do
not
believe
that
this
court
established
a
high
threshold
requiring
that
before
we
could
use
our
section
or
any
of
the
other
states
who
have
joined
us
can
use
their
respective
sessions,
they've
got
to
have
the
face-to-face
confrontation
between
the
defendant
and
the
victim
or
the
televised
face
to
face.
i
suggest
to
you,
justices,
that
that
would
be
illogical
to
require
the
very
trauma
to
be
experienced
that
we
in
maryland
are
trying
to
eliminate,
and
this
is
what
the
court,
if
upheld,
would
require
us
in
maryland
to
do.
try
first
to
see
if
the
young
children
who
are
deemed
by
experts
to
be
potentially
seriously
emotionally
distressed,
try
first
to
see
if
they
can
confront
the
defendant.
if
they
are
distressed
and
break
down,
then
go
to
the
two-way
television
procedure.
if
they
are
again
distressed
and
break
down,
then
and
finally
then,
you
can
use
the--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--it
is
the
plain
meaning,
justice
white,
of
the
term
"serious
emotional
distress"
such
that
one
cannot
reasonably
communicate.
i
respectfully
suggest
that
is
functional
unavailability.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
well,
then...
then,
as
again...
and
our
statutes
quite
candidly
permit
the
use
of
this
for
any
person
17
and
under.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
like
a
dry
run.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
but,
your
honor,
if...
if
we
are
correct--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--we
don't
want
to
cause
the
serious
emotional
distress.
we
want
to
protect
children--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--well,
then,
if...
if
they're
severe...
if
the
experts
say
there
will
be
serious
emotional
distress
but
they
will
not...
they
still
will
be
able
to
reasonably
communicate,
well,
then,
they
have
to,
sadly,
go
in
court.
actually--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--because
we
think
it
would
be
illogical
if
we're
trying
to
protect
children
from
this
serious
emotional
distress
to
make
them
incur
the
very
thing
we're
trying
to
protect
them
from.
that's
where
we
differ
very
strongly
with
our
court
of
appeals.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
serious...
well,
our
statute,
in
all
candor,
justice
white,
requires
the
finding
of
serious
emotional
distress
such
that--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--they
cannot
reasonably
communicate.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
that
would
be
correct,
justice.
you'd
have
to
have
the
functional
unavailability
as
we
talked
in,
i
believe,
the
roberts
analysis.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
that
is
not
a
maryland
statute,
justice
scalia.
however--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--the
criteria,
is
there
a
compelling
public
policy?
and
we
argue,
and
i
hope
that
the
court
will
agree,
there
is
this
compelling
public
policy
not
only
in
maryland
but
indeed
across
this
country,
that
children
can
be,
as
the
court
has
in
the
past
in
other
cases
dealing
with
the
disposition
of...
distributing
of
pornography,
child
labor
laws,
juvenile
court
systems,
we
always
tend
to
support
and
protect
children
differently
from...
from
adults,
because
an
adult
can...
an
adult...
with
all
due
respect,
an
adult
rape
victim
who
may
be
traumatized
by
this
experience
i
believe
is
better
equipped
to
understand
that
in
that
courtroom
setting
that
individual
who
did
that
bad
thing
cannot
attack
her.
we
had
testimony
from
these
experts,
one
in
particular,
that
asked
the
police,
please
keep
this
person
away
from
me.
they...
they
were
in
fear.
read
that...
they
were
in
fear
for
their
lives,
the
lives
of
their
parents.
they
were
told
never
to
tell,
and
when
you
tell
this
to
a
person
who
is
four
years
of
age
and
five
years
of
age,
that
makes
an
indelible
imprint
and
thus
we
believe
there
is
a
difference.
now,
if--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
we
don't--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--or
perhaps
a
retarded
person.
i...
i
know
what...
where
you're
heading,
and
i
would
be
sympathetic
with
that,
but
that
is
not
now
a
demonstrated--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--i
believe
the
state,
maryland
in
our
child
case
by
our
statute,
or
any
other
state
who
ever
attempts
to
have
something
other
than
the
preferable
face
to
face,
must
demonstrate
by
testimony,
reliability,
and
they
must
demonstrate
the
unavailability
of
that
particular
person,
and
if
they're
unavailable--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--functional
unavailability--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--in
our
case,
or
functionally
unavailability
in
the...
in
the
case
of
the
rape
victim
or
the
elderly
person.
yes,
justice,
i
would
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to...
if
there
is
a
demonstrated,
compelling
public
policy.
now,
of
course,
in
our
case
we
say
we
can
document
our
compelling
public
policy,
and
i
would
invite,
insofar
as
the
truthfulness
of
the
children,
i
would
invite
for
your
review
the
american
psychological
association
amicus
which
was
kind
enough
to
be
delivered
and
which
takes
neither
side,
but
it
spells
out
very
clearly
what
these
experts
find
to
be
the
difficulties
suffered
by
children
in
a
stressful
situation.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
i...
justice,
i
don't
recall
the
word
"impossible".
i--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--they--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--well--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--i
understand,
justice.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
i
agree,
justice.
the
testament
of
these
experts
talked
about,
they
would
curl
up
and
would
not
talk,
so
i...
that
would
be...
in
fact
that
was
the
main
witness
would...
so
that
would
be...
although
they
didn't
use
the
word
"impossible",
if
one
would
curl
up
and
not
talk.
with
jesse
smith,
another
youngster,
similar
types
of
words.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
they
never
preliminarily
put
them
in
a
room
with
the
defendant
and
physically
saw
that
they
would
decompensate.
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
no
sir,
they
did
not.
they
did
not--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--well,
by
that...
i'm
sorry,
justice.
before
they
used
9102,
they
did
not,
as
our
court
of
appeals
suggests
coy
required,
they
did
not
require
the
victim
to
confront,
face
to
face--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--well,
that's
a
very
compelling
scenario,
and
it's
not,
of
course,
covered
by
our
particular
case.
but
again,
i
would
invite
that
there
may
well
be
other
instances,
based
on
the
roberts
suggestion,
that
if
you
find
what
is
a
functional
unavailability,
if
we're
looking
for
truth...
and
that's
really
what
we're
trying...
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
a
fair
trial
to
the
defendant,
and
indeed
a
fair
trial
to
the
state.
if
we're
looking
for
truth,
we've
got
to
get
the
evidence
in,
and
that's
why
we've
permitted
any
number
of
times--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--yes,
justice,
but
we
are
permitting
hearsay
to
come
in
if
it
is
firmly
rooted
in
our
jurisprudence
or
if
you
can
demonstrate
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
trier
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
source
of
truthfulness,
and
we
believe--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--i
concede
see
that
is
the
most
effective
way,
and
i
concede
that's
the
preferable,
but
for
the
four
or
five-year-old
child
who
simply
can't
do
that.
absent
their
testimony--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--no,
justice,
what
we...
we
want
the
child
to
be
able
to
tell
her
story
and
for
the
jury
to
hear
the
truth
of
what
happened,
and
if
the
only
way
she
can
do
that
is
by
being
permitted
in
a
narrow
sense
just
to
be
in
another
room,
under
oath,
cross-examination
and
the
jury
sees
her,
that's
far
preferable
than
permitting
in
some
hearsay
testimony
where
there
is
none
of
those.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time,
sir.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
i
would
like
to
respond,
if
i
might,
to
justice
kennedy.
prior
to
the
videotaping,
justice,
there
was
the
competency
hearing
in
which
the
child...
each
of
the
children
did
visit
the
judge's
chamber
with
the
judge
and
there
was
the
dialogue
between
the
judge
and
the
child
to
ascertain
that
the
child
was
competent
to
then
go
into
the
videotape
hearing.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
oh,
immediately
preceding
the
taping
by
moments.
the
judge
then
left
to
go
out
on
the
bench.
the
child
remained
in
the--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--i
believe,
justice,
that
was
done
by
the
clerk,
but
i...
the
questioning
was--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--i
do
not
recall
that,
sir.
i
think
it
was
done
by
the
clerk,
and
it
might
have
been
when
the
judge
was
already
on
the
bench.
we
respectfully
disagree
with
the
respondent
that
one
should
freeze
in
time
from
this
day
forth
the...
the
years
and
decades
of
exceptions
that
have
been
rightfully
granted
under
the
hearsay
rule.
in
truth,
we
could
have
a
situation
where
an
excited
utterance
of
this
child
might
be
permitted
in
as
deemed
to
be
reliable,
but
we
suggest
that
better
for
the
defendant
to
have
the
even
more
reliable
opportunity
to
see
the
child
live,
under
oath,
with
extensive
cross-examination
and
the
jury
to
assess
the
reliability
and
credibility.
we
believe,
justices,
that
the
other
day
has--
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
--no,
sir.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
the
jury
in
our
procedure
is
in
the
same
room
as
the
defendant,
yes.
mr.
j.
joseph
curran,
jr.
oh
yes...
yes,
justice.
we
believe,
sir,
that
the
other
day
that
has
been
referred
to
in
coy
has
arrived.
there
is
this
compelling
state
interest,
and
indeed
a
genuine,
compelling
national
interest,
that...
that
this
type
of
procedure,
the
number...
sadly,
the
number
of
child
abuse
cases
is
rising.
maryland
and
other
states
are
trying
to
respond
with
a
legitimate
procedure.
we
have
a
procedure
which
we
generally
believe--
