justice
marshall
mr.
attorney
general,
does
your
test...
your
evidence
from
these
experts,
their
testimony,
did
they
say
that
it
was
impossible
for
this
child
to
testify?
i
didn't
see
that
word
any
place.
justice
marshall
well,
weren't
you
obliged
to
go
that
far--
justice
marshall
--before
you
put
somebody
in
jail
for
15
years?
justice
marshall
you
talk
about
the
trauma
for
the
child.
15
years
in
prison,
there's
a
little
bit
of
trauma,
too.
justice
marshall
but
they
never
made
any
effort
to
find
out.
justice
marshall
do
you
need
the
word
"preliminarily"
in
there?
they
never
did
it.
justice
marshall
so
you
don't
need
the
word
"preliminarily".
justice
marshall
what
would
you
do
with
an
adult
with
a
mental
age
of
five?
