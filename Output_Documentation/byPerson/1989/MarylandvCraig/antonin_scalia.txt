justice
scalia
general
curran,
of
course
it
wouldn't
matter
if
it
was
live
or
not.
i
mean,
it
could
have
been
videotaped.
it
would
have
looked
exactly
the
same
to
the
jury.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
you
can't
tell
when
you're
looking
at
it.
they
are
really
just
electronic
dots
on
a...
on
a
screen.
justice
scalia
so
it
could
have
been
a
movie
taken
two
years
ago.
justice
scalia
and
so
when
you
say
live--
justice
scalia
--how
was
the
camera
set
up?
did
it
do
a
closeup
the
way
a
juror
can
look
at
the
back
and
forth
between
the
person
answering...
asking
the
question
and
the...
and
the
child
giving
the
answer,
to
see
whether
the
person
is,
by
gesture,
by...
by
expression,
coaxing
the
child?
justice
scalia
you
couldn't
tell
what...
what
the
prosecutor
was
eliciting
from
the
child
by
much
of
the
testimony
in...
in
this
case
concerning
the
suggestibility
of
children,
so
as...
that
that...
the
suggestions
can
be
made
by
all
sorts
of
subtle
manners
in...
in
the
person
answering
the
question?
the
jury
could
not
observe
any
of
that
in
this?
justice
scalia
just
the
face
of
the
child?
justice
scalia
so
it
isn't...
how...
what
was
the
punishment
for
the
offense
here?
justice
scalia
but
for
15
years
possible
in
jail,
mrs.
craig,
just
on
the
saying
of
one...
you
say
they
were
not
even
all
psychiatrists.
they...
they--
justice
scalia
--none--
justice
scalia
--and
on
the
basis
of
no
more
than
the
judgment
of
one
licensed
social
worker,
this
woman
could
be
sent
to
jail
for
15
years
on
the
basis
of
testimony
of
a
child
that
she
never
even
had
the
opportunity
to
be
in
the
room
with
when
the
child
said
that
testimony,
to
look
at
the
child
or
if
she
wanted
to
personally
conduct
cross-examination
to
ask
that
child,
you
know,
child,
did
i
really
do
this
to
you.
on
the
basis
of
one
licensed
social
worker,
she
has
been
deprived
of
that?
justice
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
that
evidence.
i
mean,
that's
other
evidence.
we're
just
talking
about
the
testimony
of
the
child,
whether
that
should
have
been
admissible
or
whether
the
woman
should
have
been
able
to
confront
the
child.
that's
all
we're
talking
about.
you
say
it
was
just
on
the
basis
of
a
licensed
social
worker
that
said
that
the
child
would
be
too
upset?
justice
scalia
i
understand
that,
and
that's
something
of
an
emotional
trauma.
but
this
woman
is
going
to
jail
for
15
years.
i
mean,
if
you...
if
you
weigh
the
possible
emotional
trauma
to
the
child
against
a
15-year
jail
sentence,
is
it...
is
it...
is
it
hard
to
come...
come
to
the
conclusion
which
way
you
should
go?
justice
scalia
and
the
presence
of
the
defendant.
justice
scalia
and
the
ability
of
counsel...
if
the
defendant
wanted
to
ask
the
questions
herself
to
ask
the
child
questions,
or
counsel
to
say,
you
know,
there...
there
is
mrs.
craig,
your
mother,
did
she
really
do
those
things.
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
think
that
that
isn't
important.
justice
scalia
emotional
distress
actually
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
except
that
that's
the
reason
for
the
functional
disability.
it
could
be
some
other
reason.
i
mean,
we
don't
protect
witnesses
from
emotional
distress.
a
child
is...
is
no
more
emotionally
distressed
than
a...
than
a
fully
adult
rape...
rape
victim.
is...
is
that
the
next
step
that
maryland
is
going
to
take,
to
protect
rape
victims
from
emotional
distress
by
also
allowing
them
not
to
testify
and--
justice
scalia
--emotional
distress
is
not
the
criterion.
it's
unavailability.
justice
scalia
well,
but
we're
not
looking
for
truth
at
any
cost.
we
exclude
a
whole
lot
of
things
because
the
chances
are
it's
true,
but
it's
just
not
close
enough
to
be
true
that
we'll
keep
it
out.
i
mean,
it...
isn't
the
first
rule
of
our
criminal
trials,
like
the
hippocratic
oath,
first
do
no
harm?
don't
put
away
for
15
years
someone
who
doesn't
belong
there?
and
you
don't
take
chances
as
to
whether--
justice
scalia
--but
isn't
the
best
way
for
the
trier
of
fact
to
look
at
the
witness
and
look
at
the
witness'
reaction
to
the
questions
and
the
questioner's
attitudes,
the
expressions
of
the
questioners,
and
to
see
the
way
the
witness
interacts
with
the
defendant
that
is
supposed
to
have
done
this
harm
to
the
witness?
isn't
that
the
most
effective
way
to...
to
determine
the
truth?
justice
scalia
it's
still
the
most
effective
if
the
child
in
fact
weighs
it
and
says,
hi,
mommy.
then
you
know
that
the
child...
all
of
this
has
been
suggested.
wouldn't
that
be
enormously
effective
in
the
trial,
if
the
child
comes
into
the
courtroom
and
says,
hi,
mommy?
there's
not
even
been
an
opportunity
for
that
in
this
trial,
just
on
the
basis
of
a
social
worker
who
says
no,
the
child
would
curl
up
into
a
ball.
you
want
to
put
away
somebody
for
15
years
on...
on
that
prediction?
justice
scalia
mr.
murphy,
we
don't
really
know
that
even
adults
appear
to
testify...
that
the
truth
process
is
served
by
having
adults
testify
in...
in
front
of
black
robes,
as
you
put
it.
it
might
indeed
be
better,
for
all
we
know,
to
videotape
them
at
home
sitting
in
their
easy
chair
in
a
more
natural
environment.
but
what
we
do
know
is
that
sometimes...
sometimes...
often
enough...
that
it
serves
the
truth-serving
function.
they...
they...
they
get
frightened
by...
into
telling
the
truth
by
seeing
black
robes,
and
isn't
that
enough
to
support
your
case?
you...
you
don't
have
to
prove
that
it
always
does
it
or
even
that
it
usually
does
it.
justice
scalia
just
that
it
sometimes
does
it,
i
thought.
i
thought
that
that's
the
assumption
we
operated
under.
justice
scalia
again,
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
it
was
live
or
not.
justice
scalia
it
would
be
just
as
effective
if
it
was
a
videotape,
as
far
as
the
jury--
justice
scalia
that
would
be
the
case
with
a
videotape,
too?
