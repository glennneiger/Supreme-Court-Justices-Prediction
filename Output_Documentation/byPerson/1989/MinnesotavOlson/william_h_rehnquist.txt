ms.
peek.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
peek,
may
not
the
factor
that
he
was
never
left
alone
have
some
bearing
on
what
authority
the
people
who
owned
the
house
wanted
him
to
have?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
peek.
mr.
marzen?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
marzen.
mr.
bruder?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
refer
to
him
as
an
overnight
guest,
mr.
bruder.
was
he
given
a
bed
to
sleep
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was
the
living
room
a
place
where
he,
and
he
alone,
had
dominion,
so
to
speak?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
not
quite
like
the
case,
then,
where
one
goes
to
someone's
house
to
visit
and
they
say,
here's
your
room
and
here
are
your
towels
and
so
forth,
and
you're
given
at
least
a
room
over
which
you
have
some
dominion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
really
generalize
that
much
about
an
overnight
house
guest,
that
you
have
the
run
of
the
house?
i
have
certainly
visited
in
people's
homes
where
i
didn't
feel
i
had
the
run
of
the
house.
i...
haven't
you
had
a
similar
experience?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
you
think
that
a
common
experience
is
much
more
like
yours
than
like
mine?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
relationship
here?
i
don't
mean
necessarily,
you
know,
blood
or
marital
relations,
but
factual
relationship
here
between
the
defendant
and
the
people
who
owned
the
house?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
we
could
decide
the
exigent
circumstances
question
on
the
same
basis
that
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
did?
i.e.,
assume
there
was
probable
cause
without
deciding
it,
and
then
remand
to
the
supreme
court
of
minnesota
to
see
whether
there
was
probable
cause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bruder.
ms.
peek,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
peek.
the
case
is
submitted.
