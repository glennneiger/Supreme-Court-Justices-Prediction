well,
doesn't
an
ordinary
house
guest
have
some
expectation
that
he
won't
be
bothered
by
strangers
while
within
the
home?
isn't
there
some
reasonable
expectation
there,
when
i'm
a
guest
in
someone
else's
home?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
isn't
it
a
reasonable
one,
one
that
society
is
prepared
to
accept?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
we
need
some
fairly
clear
rules
for
the
police,
things
that
aren't
so
fact
specific?
how's
the
policeman
going
to
know
the
length
of
the
visit,
or
whether
a
key
has
been
given,
or
who
has
given
permission?
i
mean,
why
shouldn't
we
try
to
craft
and
follow
fairly
simple
rules
to
govern
the
police
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you're
certainly
not
asking
us
to
craft
one
here.
it's
very
fact-specific
and
very
complex.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why,
here,
shouldn't
the
police
go'
get
a
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
it
was
sunday.
it
was
a
"never
on
sunday"
rule,
apparently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
thought...
i
thought
the
minnesota
supreme
court
concluded
that
the
respondent
had
the
right
to
exclude
others.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
we
bound
by
that
determination,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
we
normally
accept
determinations
of
that
type
by
state
courts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
marzen,
do
most
jurisdictions
today
have
provisions
for
getting
search
warrants
by
telephone?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
why...
why
are
you
saying
it
inevitably
would
take
hours
to
get
the
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
using
the
telephonic
procedure?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
bruder,
the
state
also
argues
there
were
exigent
circumstances.
did
you
intend
to
address
that
issue?
