justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
peek,
your
answer
is,
it
doesn't
matter,
does
it?
the
police
are
breaking
the
law.
the
only
thing
we're
arguing
about...
there's
no
doubt
that
they
violated
the
constitution.
the
question
we
are
arguing
about
today
is,
have
they
violated
your
right
as
well
as
his
right?
it's
clear
that
they're
violating
the
right
of
the
person
who
owns
the
premises.
the
only
question
is,
whether
they,
in
addition,
are
violating
any
right
of
the
guest,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
predictability
has
nothing
to
do
with
this.
the...
the
police
don't...
the
police
are
in
the
wrong
no
matter
what,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
clearly
violated
somebody's
constitutional
right.
the
only
thing
we're
arguing
about
is
whether
they've
violated
the
guests
as
well
as
what
they
clearly
have
violated...
the
owners.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
police
predictability
is
really
out
of
the
case.
well,
except
for
the
fact
that
they
know
this
man
isn't
the
owner,
and
they
don't
care
if
they
violate
the
owner's
constitutional
rights
because
they're
not
worried
about
introducing
any
evidence
against
him.
they
don't
even
care
about
this...
the
guy
they're
looking
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
quite
so,
and
in...
in
a
way
a
vague
and
unpredictable
rule
is
even
better,
right,
isn't
it,
because
then
they
can
never
be
sure
that
even
though
they're
violating
the
constitution
there
will
be
no
harmful
consequence
following
from
it?
we
should
really
have
a
very,
very
unpredictable
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
peek,
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying.
is
it
your
position
that
if
somebody
knocked
at
the
door
and
the
person
said,
"i
want
to
come
in",
that
he
would
have
had
to
let
them
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
he's
the
only
one
home
and
somebody,
some
stranger
knocks
on
the
door
and
says
hi,
i
was
just
passing
by.
i
thought
i'd
like
to
walk
around
and
see
what
this
apartment
looks
like.
do
you
think
he
would
have
had
to
say
hey,
i
have
no
right
to
exclude
anybody?
do
you
really
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
all
depends
on
the
accident
about
whether
he
happened
to
have
been
left
alone?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
hamper
law
enforcement,
because
as
you've
before,
the
police
should
not
have
gone
in,
right,
on
the
assumption
that
there
were
no
exigent--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
but
on
the
assumption
that
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances,
you
concede
that
the
police
should
not
have
gone
in,
if
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
whatever
we
say
about
this
rule
about
who
can
assert
the
right
of
privacy
here,
it's
not
going
to
hamper
law
enforcement.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
okay.
that's
it.
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
am
not
sure
that
they
are
flip
sides
of
the
same
coin.
i
may
have
a
right
to
admit
without
having
a
right
to
exclude,
which
is
always
the
case
where
there
is
joint
occupancy.
i
have
a
right
to
admit...
and
let's
assume
i...
i'm
leasing
an
apartment
jointly
with
a
friend.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
a
right
to
admit
my
guests.
he
has
a
right
to
admit
his
guests.
i
don't
have
a
right
to
exclude
his
guests,
and
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
exclude
mine.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
right
to
admit
does
not...
i
mean,
that's
the
point.
you're
saying
the
right
to
admit
is
just
the
flip
side
of
the
right
to
exclude,
and
it
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
any
fourth
amendment
claim,
it's
the
particular
fourth
amendment
claim
that
your
home
has
been
invaded.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
should
it
make
any
difference
whether
you're
transient
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's...
let's
assume
you're...
you're
in
the
same...
you
know,
the
friend's
house
that
you
say
you
occasionally
stay
at.
you're
just
there
for
dinner.
why...
why
should
your
expectation
that
you
won't
be
burst
in
upon
be
any
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
you've
been
given
the
run
of
the
place,
if
the
person
said
mi
casa
es
su
casa,
and
really
meant
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you'd
be
all
right.
you'd
have
the
whole
run
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
we
changed
it
and
just
added
the
one
qualifier,
that
you
have
to
have
had
a
key
which
you
were
permitted
to
use
generally
and
not
for
the
one
specific
purpose
that
your
cleaning
woman
is
allowed
to
use
it...
that
is,
to
come
in
and
clean.
justice
antonin
scalia
surely,
when
you
give
somebody
a
key
and
say
here,
the
apartment
is
yours,
it
means
the
apartment's
yours.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the
first...
we've
gone
over
it
again
and
again.
it
doesn't
matter.
they
shouldn't
have
gone
in,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay?
