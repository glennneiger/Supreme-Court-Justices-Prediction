what
if
you
had
a
teenager
home
with
the
parent,
would
the
teenager...
and
the
parent
says
come
on
in,
would
that
mean
the
teenager
has
no
privacy
interest
in
the
home?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then,
why
is
that
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
would
have
to
answer
justice
scalia
saying
even
if
he
were
all
alone
he
couldn't
have
said
no.
don't
you
have
to
look
at
it
as
though
this
person
were
the
only
person
answering
the
door?
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
concede
that
he
had
standing
when
he
was
alone,
wouldn't
he
have
had
precisely
the
same
privacy
interest
just
because
someone
he
is
familiar
with
is
present?
why
does
that
lessen
his
privacy
interest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
position
on
whether
he
could
have
refused
to
let
somebody
in
if
he'd
been
there
alone?
don't
you
agree
he
had
that
authority?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
position
with
regard
to
his
privacy
interest
had
he
been
alone?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
marzen,
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
one
thing.
assume
they
did
not
have
probable
cause
at
the
time
of
the
entry.
would
the
exigent
circumstance
doctrine
have
defended...
to
justify
the
entry?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
is
your
position
there
was
probable
cause
at
the
time
of
the
entry,
but
arguably
not
before
the
phone
call?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
your
flip
side
argument
suggests
that
we
should
analyze
this
as
though
he's
the
only
person
with
an
interest
to
be
examined.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
that's
true--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what's
your
answer
to
the
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
position,
mr.
bruder?
was
there
or
was
there
not
probable
cause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
was
not.
so
you
don't
claim
they
should
have
gotten
a
warrant
earlier,
then.
they
couldn't
have,
obviously.
