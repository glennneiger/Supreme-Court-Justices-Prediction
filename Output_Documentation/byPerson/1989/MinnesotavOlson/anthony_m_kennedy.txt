justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
what's
at
issue
here
is
a
statement
that
was
given
at
the
police
station?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
at
the
time
that
he
was
at
the
police
station,
was
there
not
probable
cause
to
hold
the
prisoner?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
how
is
it
that
this
statement
is
really
related
to
what
occurred
in
the
dwelling
in
any
event?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
there
would
have
been
a
right,
i
take
it,
to
let
him
go
for
30
seconds
and
re-arrest
him
after
he
got
outside
of
the
dwelling.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
no
right
to
be
free
from
custody
once
they
are
in
the
station
house
just
because
there
has
been
an
unlawful
entry
in
the
dwelling,
is
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
is
no
right
to
an
immediate
release
at
the
station
house,
a
release
from
custody,
merely
because
there
has
been
an
unlawful
entry
into
the
dwelling,
even
assuming
the
entry
to
the
dwelling
was
unlawful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
why
is
it
that
we
really
have
to
reach
this
issue?
why
isn't
this
just
an
admissible
statement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
the
exigent
circumstances.
but
just
on...
on
the
right
of
the
police
to
enter
the
dwelling,
justice
o'connor
indicates
that
the
rule
you
argue
is
fact
specific,
and
i
might
add
it's
all
post
hoc.
you
don't
know
about
the
key,
and
how
long
he's
been
there,
and
whether
he
has
the
right
to
exclude
guests
until
after
he
is
arrested
and
it
comes
out
in
suppression,
so
it's
a
very
unworkable
rule,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
forgetting
exigent
circumstances
for
the
moment,
is
it
not
your
position
that
the
police
can
arrest
a
person
in
a
dwelling
if
that
person
has
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
there?
that's
your
position,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
they
were
right,
was
there
not...
did
they
not
have
the
authority
to
enter
the
home
and
make
the
arrest,
or
do
you
concede
that
they
were
violating
the
rights
of
the
owner
of
this
home?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
doesn't
bother
you
that
all
of
this
inquiry
is
post
hoc,
consisting
of
facts
that
the
police
will
never
know
one
way
or
the
other
until
after
the
arrest
has
been
made?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
why
don't
we
just
enact
a
rule
to
that
effect?
if
that's
what
you
want,
that's
what
you
get.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
then
we'll
enforce
the
rule
by
saying
that
if
you
don't
have
a
warrant
it's
an
illegal
arrest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
forget
exigent
circumstances
for
the
moment.
i
mean,
if
you're
saying
that
what
we
want
the
police
to
assume
that
they
must
always
have
warrant,
absent
exigent
circumstances,
then
why
don't
we
just
enact
that
as
the
rule?
that's
what
exclusionary
rules
are
for.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
a
cornered...
what's
a
cornered
felon?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
police
come
out
with
their
sirens
and
their
lights
blaring,
is
he
then
cornered,
because
the
police
have
let
him
know
that
they're
there?
