mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
beginning
my
argument
today:
i'd
like
to
respond
briefly
to
a
question
that
was
raised
by
justice
o'connor
with
respect
to
the
telephone
search
warrant.
the
only
testimony
with
respect
to
the
time
involved
in
obtaining
a
warrant
i
believe
appears
at
page
130
of
the
transcript.
it
is
in
response
to
my
questioning
and
it
is
dealing
with
an
arrest
warrant.
there
was
never
any
testimony
directly
from
detective
deconcini
with
respect
to
the
time
necessary
to
obtain
a
search
warrant.
that
aside,
the
seminal
issue
before
the
court
today
is
whether
an
overnight
guest
can
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
sufficient
to
invoke
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment.
respondent's
position
is
that
an
overnight
house
guest
can,
and
does,
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
which
this
society,
through
custom
and
practice,
is
prepared
to
honor.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
no,
your
honor.
the
testimony
is
that
he
slept
in
the
living
room.
whether
he
slept
on
the
couch
or
the
floor,
i
don't
recall
if
the
record
indicates
that.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
i
believe
the
living
room
was
a
common
area.
i
think
there
was
some
testimony
that
they
had
had
common
activities
there
the
night
before
and
that
he
and
another
house
guest
had
stayed
in
the
living
room
that
particular
night.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
well,
in
some
ways,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
exactly
like
that.
it
depends
on
the
size
of
the
house,
and
i
don't
think
that
we
can
qualify
somebody's
right
to
invoke
the
fourth
amendment
based
on
the
size
of
the
dwelling
that
he
resides
in.
from
personal
experience,
i
can
tell
you
that
the
last
time
i
had
an
overnight
house
guest,
it
was
my
former
roommate
from
california
and
he
slept
in
the
living
room
because
we
don't
have
a
spare
room
for
him.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
mere
fact
that
he
doesn't
have
a
bedroom
that
they
made
available
to
him
doesn't
necessarily
impact
on
his
right
to
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
dwelling
that
society
is
willing
to
honor.
typically
speaking,
an
overnight
house
guest
is
somewhat
different
from
a
mere
transitory
visitor.
an
overnight
house
guest
is
treated
as
more
akin
to
a
member
of
the
family.
he
has
a
right
to
go
throughout
the
common
areas
of
the
house,
to
go
into
the
kitchen,
to
go
into
adjacent
areas,
areas
that
a
mere
transitory
visitor
might
not
normally
be
expected
to
stay
at.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
i
hate
to
disagree
with
the
chief
justice
of
the
united
states,
but
no,
your
honor,
i
have
not
had
that
experience.
[laughter]
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
i
would
suggest,
trying
to
get
out
of
this
as
diplomatically
as
i
can,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
common
experience
has
to
take
in
all
gambits
of
society,
large
houses
as
well
as
small
houses,
and
that
there
are
certainly
situations,
and
quite
common
circumstances
in
this
country,
where
an
overnight
house
guest
may
not
have
an
area
segregated
to
them,
but
nonetheless
has,
in
essence,
rights
that
are
akin
to
members
of
the
household
and
in
those
circumstances
it's
our
position
that
that
house
guest
has
a
reasonable
expectation--
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
--he
did
indeed,
your
honor.
he
had
an
extra
suit
of
clothing.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
i
think
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
by
which
they
arrive
at
the
house.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
he
stayed
there
one
night.
he
was
there
approximately
a
day
and
a
half
before
his
arrest,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
he
was
a
day
and
a
half,
your
honor,
and
he
did
also
testify
at
the
pretrial
suppression
hearing
that
he
had
no
other
place
to
reside
and
he
intended
to
stay
there.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
i
don't
give
up
to...
well,
your
honor,
the
fact
is,
unfortunately
he
was
arrested
before
he
could
stay
there
more
than
one
night--
[laughter]
but
there
was
testimony...
there
was
testimony
before
the...
at
the
suppression
hearing
that
indicated
that
he
intended
to
stay
there
for
an
indeterminate
future.
unfortunately,
in
the
interim
the
police
decided--
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
--yes,
your
honor.
both
mrs.
bergstrom
and
her
daughter
julie,
who
had
given
him
permission
to
stay
at
the
house,
indicated
that
as
far
as
they
were
concerned
he
was
welcome
to
stay
for
the
indeterminate
future.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
no,
but
my
position
is
that
one
night
gives
him
enough
standing,
so
to
speak,
to
come
before
this
court
and
avail
himself
of
his
fourth
amendment
privilege.
in
challenging
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
decision,
both
the
petitioner's
counsel
and
the
solicitor
general
emphasize
the
fact
that
the
respondent
did
not
have
a
formal
tenancy
interest
or
an
ownership
interest
in
the
duplex
where
he
was
arrested,
and
while
those
might
certainly
be
factors,
i
don't
believe
that
they're
wholly
determinative
factors.
in
jones
and
rakas
and
in
katz,
this
court
repeatedly
rejected
the
notion
that
concepts
of
property
law
control
an
individual's
right
to
assert
a
fourth
amendment
claim.
nonetheless,
the
solicitor
general
in
particular
argues
that
an
individual
does
not
have
sufficient
right
to
assert
a
fourth
amendment
claim
unless
he
has
some
type
of
property
interest
or
quasi-property
interest
in
the
dwelling
where
he
was
arrested.
that
particular
model
is
not--
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
--i
believe
that
the...
what
the
solicitor
general
is
in
essence
arguing
is
that
unless
it's
your
home
or
your
tenancy,
you
don't
have
a
right
to
object
to
your
arrest
in
that
particular
dwelling,
and
that
particular
model
does
not
work
very
well
based
on
the
common
sense
living
arrangements
that
we
have
in
society.
we
have
to
recognize
the
simple
fact
is
that
couples
choose
to
cohabit,
that
individuals
take
on
roommates
to
share
rental
tenancies,
and
that
friends
may
briefly
reside
with
one
another
for
a
day
or
longer.
and
in
each
of
those
models,
to
some
degree
the
person
coming
into
the
living
situation
has
to
subordinate
his
or
her
right
to
exclude
others
to
that...
to
the
desires
of
the
people
that
they're
with
at
the
time,
and
under
the
solicitor
general's
model,
that
would
suggest
that
those
individuals'
privacy
expectation
should
be
swept
aside.
i'd
suggest
that
that...
that
is
unsupported.
our
position
is
that
where
an
individual
is
claiming
fourth
amendment
protection
and
is
part
of
a
sufficiently
small
and
intimate
group
sharing
living
quarters,
that
he
or
she
has
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
should
be
recognized
by
this
court.
that
particular
expression
will
not
extend
fourth
amendment
protection
beyond
its
reasonable
scope.
for
example,
it's
not
going
to
suggest
that
everyone
living
in
a
homeless
shelter
has
a
right
to
invoke
the
cloak
of
the
fourth
amendment,
because
that
is
neither
a
small,
a
private
nor
an
intimate
setting.
similarly,
it
will
not
necessarily
extend
it
to
persons
who
are
casual
or
transitory
guests
who
are
there
for
a
very
brief
duration,
but
it
will
preserve
the
respondent's
cloak
of
fourth
amendment
protection.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
your
honor,
i--
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
--i
would
welcome
the
court
holding
that,
but
realistically
i
think
that
the
difference
is
that
when
you're
there
for
dinner,
again,
it
deals
with
the
freedom
that
you're
given
over
the
premises.
when
you're
an
overnight
house
guest,
if
you
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night,
you
go
into
the
kitchen,
you
fix
yourself
a
snack,
you
may
go
into
the
living
room
and
watch
tv
if
you're
restless
and
can't
sleep.
when
you're
a
visitor
for
dinner,
your
use
of
the
premises
is
basically
restricted
to
the
dining
room,
to
the
den
if
you
have
an
after-dinner
drink,
in
essence--
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
i
think
that
that
would
obviously
be
a
very
fact-specific
circumstance,
and
i
don't
know
if
this
court,
in
laying
down
broader
holdings,
can
necessarily
articulate
that
in
any
sort
of
a
general
standard,
but
i
certainly
think
that
that
would
be,
you
know,
a
foreseeable
result
if
that
were
the
circumstance.
however,
obviously
we
have
to
be
concerned
about
the...
you
know,
the...
whether
or
not
that
is
in
fact
something
that's
commonly
found
in
the
situation
where
you
do
have
a
transitory
visitor,
or
something
that's
just
derived
solely
for
the
purpose
of
invoking
a
fourth
amendment
claim
for
a
person's
self-interest.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
they
were
friends.
julie
bergstrom
was
a
friend
of
robert
olson,
and
robert
olson
was
also
acquainted
with
the
mother,
louann
bergstrom.
both
of
them
gave
him
permission
to
stay
there,
and
he
intended
to
stay
for
the
indeterminate
future.
contrary
to
the
claims
advanced
by
petitioner,
exclusive,
or
even
primary
control
of
a
given
area,
i
believe
has
never
been
regarded
as
a
prerequisite
for
the
assertion
of
fourth
amendment
rights.
in
particular,
in
jones
v.
united
states,
this
court
recognized
that
jones
had
standing
to
contest
the
search
even
though
his
interest
in
the
property
was
subordinate
to
that
of
his
friend
evans,
and
although
the
petitioner
argues
mightily
to
the
contrary,
i
believe
this
case
amounts...
by
the
prosecution
amounts
to
a
direct
attack
on
the
factual
holding
of
jones
v.
united
states,
as
subsequently
limited
by
rakas,
and
only
by
expressly
overturning
jones
can
this
court
overrule
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
the
minnesota
supreme
court
at
great
length
expressly
relied
on
jones
v.
united
states
in
making
its
determination.
the
factual
circumstances
of
jones
are
that
jones,
on
the
day
of
the
incident
in
question,
admitted
himself
with
a
key,
had
a
suit
and
a
shirt
at
the
apartment,
that
his
home
was
elsewhere,
that
he
paid
nothing
for
the
use
of
the
apartment,
and
that
he'd
slept
there
for
but
a
single
night.
the
only
distinguishing
factor
between
this
case
and
jones
is
that
jones
had
possession
of
a
key.
and
while
that
was
certainly
one
of
the
factors
examined
by
the
court
in
that
decision,
i
don't
think
that
it
can
be
elevated
to
the
sort
of
crucible
level
that
the
state
would
suggest.
for
example,
if
possession
of
a
key
was
wholly
determinative,
it
could
lead
to
bizarre
and
absurd
results.
the
cleaning
woman
who
comes
in
and
cleans
my
house
every
other
week
has...
has
a
key
to
the
premises,
and
since
she's
there
during
work
hours,
she
has
exclusive
dominion
and
control
over
the
premises,
and
under
the
model
constructed
by
the
solicitor
general
and
by
the
petitioner,
my
cleaning
woman
would
presumably
have
a
greater
privacy
expectation
than
would
mr.
olson
at
the
home
of
his
friends.
and
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
an
untenable
result
from
this
model,
and
that
accordingly
it
should
be
rejected.
i
think
that
consequently--
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
--your
honor,
i
think
there
are
some--
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
--your
honor,
i
think
there
are
several
problems
with
that.
first
of
all,
it's
not
going
to
give
any
guidance
to
the
police
officers
because
they're
not
going
to
know
whether
or
not
the
individual
involved
has
a
key.
second,
it
elevates--
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
--right.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
well,
the
second
problem
is
that
it
to
some
degree
supplants
privacy
expectations
for
a
mechanistic
concept,
and
it
evaluates...
it
makes
standing
from
fourth
amendment
purposes
basically
a
luck
of
the
draw
situation.
if
you
happen
to
be
let
alone
and
have
a
key,
you
have
standing,
but
if
you
don't,
because
your
guest
is...
your
host
is
showing
you
around
town
for
the
entire
duration
of
your
stay,
you
don't
have
standing,
and
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
particularly
sensible
result.
so
i'd
say
that
at
least
from
those
two
measures,
there
are
significant
problems
with
giving
the
key
that
kind
of
primacy
importance,
and
i'd
add
that
because
mr.
olson,
in
contrast
to
mr.
jones,
indicated
that
he
intended
to
stay
at
this
particular
dwelling
for
the
indeterminate
future,
that
any
attempt
to
reverse
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
decision
is
implicitly
an
attack
on
the
remaining
validity
of
jones
v.
united
states.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
i
will
do
so
right
now,
justice
o'connor.
assuming
that
the
court
affirms
the
respondent's
right
to
challenge
his
warrantless
arrest,
that
seizure
under
payton
and
under
welsh
is
presumptively
unlawful
unless
accompanied
by
exigent
circumstances.
generally,
the
type
of
urgent
need
that
constitutes
exigent
circumstances
is
some
sort
of
demonstrable
danger
to
the
public
or
the
police
which
will
be
minimized
by
a
warrantless
arrest,
and
it's
the
state's
burden
to
come
forward
with
proof
that
there
was
an
exigent
circumstance
here.
at
the
outset,
let
me
point
out
that
i'm
not
certain
that
this
is
a
very
good
case
for
this
court
to
decide
whether
or
not
exigent
circumstances
existed,
because
the
solicitor
general
and
the
petitioner
both
agree
that
one
of
the
prerequisites
for
the
determination
of
an
exigency
is
that
there
be
probable
cause
at
the
time
of
the
respondent's
arrest.
in
its
decision,
the
minnesota
supreme
court
expressly
decide...
determined
that
they
would
not
decide
the
probable
cause
issue
but
simply
assume
that
probable
cause
existed
for
the
purpose
of
answering
his
constitutional
challenges
and
ultimately
reversed
his
conviction.
accordingly,
if
this
court
wishes
to
look
at
exigent
circumstances,
i
think
that
the
appropriate
resolution
here
would
be
to
remand
it...
remand
this
decision
back
to
the
minnesota
supreme
court
with
instructions
to
determine
whether
or
not
probable
cause
in
fact
existed.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
my
position
is
there
was
not
probable
cause,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
my
position
is,
your
honor,
there
was
not
probable
cause,
and
even
assuming
there
was
probable
cause,
as
did
the
minnesota
supreme
court,
that
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances
that
warranted
my
client's
arrest.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
i
think
that
would
be
very
difficult
for
this
court
to
do,
because
in...
yes,
your
honor.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes.
you
could
assume
for
the
purposes
of
this
opinion
that
there
was
probable
cause,
but
ultimately
remand
it
back
to
the
state
court
to
determine
whether
in
fact
that
was
the
case.
what
i
ask
you
to
do,
obviously,
is
to
simply
affirm
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
that's
correct.
you'd
have
to
make
two
decisions,
your
honor.
first,
you'd
have
to
decide
that
my
client
had
standing,
and
second
you'd
have
to
decide
that
there
were
exigent
circumstances.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
your
honor,
that
was...
the
state
never
made
that
claim.
it
was
argued
at
the
trial
court
level,
and
i
was
furiously
flipping
through
my
trial
court
memorandum.
i
relied
on
dunaway
v.
new
york,
which
is
a
1979
decision
of
this
court,
to
suggest
that
if
his
arrest
was
unlawful
that
the
statement
that
he
made
was
the
fruit
of
that
arrest.
it
was
never
contested
by
the
state
throughout
the
proceeding,
so
i
submit
that
it's...
it's
not
an
issue
that's
before
this
court.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
i'm
a
little
troubled
by
the
question,
because
from
the
construct
that
i
began
this
defense
at,
it
was
with
the
notion
that
mr.
olson
simply
had
no
other
place
to
reside,
so
that
an
arrest
warrant
would
probably
be
the
appropriate
one,
because
this
is
as
close
as
he
had
to
a
dwelling.
but
upon
reflection
and
upon
reading
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
and
upon
rereading
steagald,
i
think
perhaps
a
search
warrant
may
have
been
the
appropriate
warrant
for
the
police
to
procure.
but
then
it
doesn't--
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
that
is...
that
is
correct.
mr.
glenn
p.
bruder
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
the
finding
that
all
that
would
be
needed
in
this
case
is
an
arrest
warrant.
i
began
the
defense
with
the
assumption
that
all
that
was
necessary
was
an
arrest
warrant.
however,
even
if
a
search
warrant
was
necessary,
that
doesn't
very
well...
that
doesn't
very
much
help
the
state's
claims
as
far
as
exigent
circumstances,
because
their
entire
position
in
this
proceeding
is
that
an
arrest
warrant
is
very
difficult
to
get
it
and
a
search
warrant
is
very
easy
to
get.
so
if
all
that
was
necessary
was
a
search
warrant,
it
would
have
been
very
easy
for
them
to
get
one
to
arrest
my
client.
certainly
on
the
day
before
the
police
were
able
to
obtain
one
in
a
relatively
brief
period
of
time.
as
far
as
the
state's
argument
is
concerned
that
an
arrest
warrant
was
more
difficult
to
obtain,
they're
very
hard-pressed
to
come
forward
with
any
proof
of
that,
your
honor,
because
they
made
no
effort
to
obtain
one.
indeed,
the
investigating
detective
testified
that
in
his
20
years
as
a
police
officer,
he'd
never
before
tried
to
obtain
an
arrest
warrant
on
a
weekend.
so
there
is
nothing
before
this
court
that
suggests
that
respondent's
arrest
would
have
been
delayed,
if
the
police
would
have
simply
taken
the
step
of
approaching
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate
and
requesting
some
type
of
warrant
be
issued.
more
than
that,
i
would
suggest
that
it's
basically
conjectural
to
believe
that
the
respondent
was
armed
at...
when
the
police
made
the
decision
to
arrest
him.
certainly
the
crime
involved
was
a
grave
one.
i'm
not
about
to
deny
that.
but
at
the
time
he
fled
from
the
police,
the
respondent
was
observed
to
be
unarmed,
and
even
the
police
anonymous
tipster
made
no
allegation
that
the
respondent
was
armed.
in
essence,
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
whereas
the
prosecution
and
the
solicitor
general
hope
to
define
exigent
circumstances,
it
will
in
effect
strike
away
at
the
heart
of
payton
v.
new
york.
the
solicitor
general
comes
in
here
and
says
that
whenever
a
dangerous
felon
is
known
to
be...
knows
that
he's
cornered
by
the
police,
the
police
have
a
right
to
go
in
and
arrest
him
without
making
the
presumption...
without
going
before
a
judge
and
attempting
to
obtain
a
warrant.
but
consider
the
implications
of
that.
in
this
case,
the
police
called
up
the
respondent
and
said,
come
out
and
surrender
yourself
to
us,
and
when
he
refused
to
do
that,
they
used
that
as
an
exigency
to
suggest,
having
done
that,
now
that
he
knows
we're
here,
we
can
come
in
and
arrest
him,
rather
than
simply
trying
to
go
before
a
judge
at
the
outset
and
obtaining
a
warrant
to
authorize
to
authorize
the
respondent's
arrest.
if
exigency
is
defined
as
the
solicitor
general
hopes
to
define
it,
there
will
be
no
situation...
absolutely
no
situation...
where
an
arrest
warrant
will
be
required
for
a
felon,
because
in
every
instance,
the
prosecution
will
be
able
to
establish
an
exigency
simply
based
on
a
phone
call
demanding
that
the
suspect
surrender
himself
voluntarily.
and
if
he
refuses
to
cooperate,
then
there's
an
exigency
and
they
can
go
in
and
make
an
arrest.
that
will
in
essence
sweep
away
most
of
the
protection
offered
by
the
fourth
amendment,
at
least
in
an
arrest
context.
i
would
like
to
briefly
conclude
by
mentioning
something
to
the
court
that
occurred
to
me
as
i
was
rather
nervously
preparing
for
this
argument
yesterday.
it's
almost
exactly
two
years
ago
that
i
stood
before
a
jury
and
that
i
told
that
jury
that
they
had
a
young
man's
future
in
their
live...
in
their
hands.
well,
this
court's
decision
will
still
have
an
immediate
impact
on
rob
olson's
future.
this
case
is
now
about
something
more
than
rob
olson.
it's
about
us.
it's
about
what
authority
our
constitution
gives
to
police
officers.
it's
about
who
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment,
and
it's
about
the
judiciary's
role
in
supervising
the
police
exercise
of
their
authority.
i
submit
to
this
court,
the
fourth
amendment
protects
and
cloaks
me
when
i
travel
to
california
later
this
spring
and
stay
with
my
friend
and
former
roommate.
i
suggest
that
it
cloaks
my
friends
and
associates
who
have
come
to
watch
me
make
this
argument
and
are
staying
with
their
friends
in
virginia,
and
i
contend
that
it
protects
petitioner's
counsel
when
she
visits
the
home
of
her
own
parents.
i
suggest
and
suspect
that
each
one
of
us
has
a
privacy
expectation
in
these
living
arrangements,
and
i
suggest
that
it
is
one
that
our
society
is
prepared
to
honor,
and
that
i
ask
that
this
court
recognize
in
its
decision.
thank
you.
