well,
what
did
the...
what
did
one
of
the
owners
say
about
this
matter?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
his
host
indicate
that
he
could
have
stayed
longer?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't
need
to
go
that
far.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
wouldn't...
we
wouldn't
do
that
unless
we
decided
that
there
were
exigent
circumstances.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
ever
suggested
in
this
case,
or
ever...
did
the
state
ever...
ever
make
the
claim
that
this
statement
that
the
after
arrest
was
not
a
fruit
of
the
illegal
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
you
agree
that
a
search
warrant
would
have
been
necessary
to
effect
this
arrest?
an
arrest
warrant
would
not
have
sufficed,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wonder
if
that's...
is
that
really
right?
what
you're
saying
is
that
he
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
but
the
owner
of
a
house,
if
you
want
to
go
arrest
him
in
his
house,
all
you
need
is
an
arrest
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
why
wouldn't
you...
all
you'd
need
is
an
arrest
warrant,
insofar
as
your
client
is
concerned?
justice
byron
r.
white
third,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court
in
minnesota
against
olson.
justices
stevens
and
kennedy
have
filed
concurring
opinions,
and
the
chief
justice
and
justice
blackmun
have
noted
their
dissent.
