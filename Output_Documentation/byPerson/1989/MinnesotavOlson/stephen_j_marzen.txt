mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
exigent
circumstances
justified
the
entry
of
the
bergstroms'
unit
in
order
to
search
for
olson
because
olson
was
a
dangerous
suspect
who
knew
that
he
had
been
cornered
by
police.
in
dealing
with
cornered
felons,
the
police
should
be
allowed
to
move
in
fast
and
in
force,
before
the
suspect
is
able
to
have
time
to
think
of
dangerous
countermeasures,
such
as
evidence
destruction--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--for
purposes
of
this
case
we
have
a
very
narrow
definition,
which
is
one
who
was
actually
tipped
off,
who
knew
that
the
police
were
on
to
him.
one
could
construe
it
a
bit
more
broadly,
as
we
would,
and
say
that
felons
who
the
police
can
reasonably
anticipate
will
discover
that
the
police
are
on
to
them--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--the
next
step
in
the
inquiry,
of
course,
as
respondent
argues,
is
that
there
was
in
fact
no
exigency
here
because
it
was
manufactured
by
police.
there
is
an
insinuation
in
that
that
it
was
improper,
what
the
police
did,
in
telephoning
the
bergstroms'
residence,
in
talking
to
julie
bergstrom
and
in
having
respondent
olson
overhear
that
conversation.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
manufacturing
of
exigent
circumstances,
justice
kennedy.
the
homicide
detective
had
every
reason
to
call
upstairs
to
the
unit
to
confirm
that
olson
was
in
fact
present.
prior
to
that
telephone
call,
the
only
information
that
he
had
that
olson
was
in
fact
upstairs
was
the
uncorroborated
tip
from
the
occupant
of
the
lower
unit
that
said
that
olson
had
returned.
that
may
well
not
have
been
sufficient
probable
cause
to
justify
going
out
for
a
search
warrant
to
search
the
bergstroms'
unit
for
olson.
in
any
event,
the
homicide
detective
was
certainly
reasonable
in
not
pushing
the
limits
of
probable
cause
and
either
trying
to
go
in
or
get
a
search
warrant
on
that
basis.
the
only
alternative
to
calling
upstairs,
in
fact,
would
have
been
to
mount
an
impromptu
stakeout
to
try
to
find
out...
to
try
to
hold...
preserve
the
status
quo.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
no.
my
understanding
of
exigent
circumstances
is
that
you
need
probable
cause
and
the
urgent
need
or
emergency
situation
in
order
to
make
that--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--arguably
not
before
the
phone
call,
so
that
is
why
he
needed
to
call
up.
in
fact,
you
could
see
that
without
any
basis,
other
than
someone
saying
that,
by
the
way,
in
the
apartment
next
door
there's
a
dangerous
felon,
you
wouldn't
want
the
police,
in
the
ordinary
run
of
the
situation,
to
go
into
homes
on
that
basis.
in
this
case,
there's
arguably
a
little
bit
more,
because
the
police
had
talked
to
the
occupant
of
the
lower
unit
before,
and
what
she
said
was
corroborated
by
what
the
telephone
tipster
said.
so
there's
arguably
a
little
more
corroboration
there.
but
i
think
the
police...
the
homicide
detective
was...
was
justified
in
not
pushing
that
probable
cause
to
the
limits.
if
the
detective
had
not
called
inside,
he
would
have
had
to
mount
an
impromptu
stakeout.
that
was
not
reasonable,
because
the
detective
could
reasonably
anticipate
that
olson
would
have
discovered
it.
there
were
eight
uniformed
police
officers
in
marked
patrol
cars
outside
the
unit.
the
odds
were
overwhelmingly
likely
that
olson,
a
fugitive
from
justice
and
on
notice
that
the
police
were
after
him
because
he
had
just
escaped
from
them
the
morning
before,
would
have
peeked
outside
and
discovered
the
stakeout.
in
that
event,
you
would
have...
all
the
dangerous
things
would
have
happened
of
evidence
taking,
armed
resistance...
or
evidence
destruction,
excuse
me...
or
hostage
taking,
or
armed
resistance.
nor
should,
i
think
the
loan
homicide
detective
on
duty
that
saturday
and
sunday
be
faulted
for
failing'
to
seek
an
arrest
warrant,
because
the
police
did
not
plan
the
arrest
of
olson
at
any
home.
even
if
the
police
thought
that
olson
would
return
to
the
bergstroms'
unit
for
some
reason,
an
arrest
warrant
would
not
have
been
sufficient
to
justify
the
intrusion
on
the
bergstroms'
privacy.
they
would
have
needed
a
search
warrant
to
search
for
olson
under
steagald
v.
united
states.
and
again,
there
would
not
have
been
probable
cause
to
obtain
that
warrant
at
least
until
the
occupant
of
the
lower
unit
had
called
detective...
the
homicide
detective
at
the
police
station
at
2:30
p.m.,
at
which
time,
of
course,
it
was
too
late
to
have
the
couple
of
hours
it
would
have
taken
to
get
a
search
warrant,
enter
the
bergstroms'
unit,
and
find
olson
in
that
case.
therefore,
we
submit
that
in
this
circumstance
where
the
police
reasonably
believed
that
respondent
olson
was
armed,
that
he
was
implicated
in
a
violent
crime...
you
know,
felony
murder,
for
which
he
was
convicted...
and
knew
that
the
police
were
within
moments
of
surrounding
him
and
getting
him,
that
exigent
circumstance
justified
the
immediate
entry.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes,
justice
o'connor,
they
do,
and
minnesota
in
fact
has
that
availability.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
well,
detective
deconcini
actually
testified,
i
believe
it
was
on
either
116
or
118
of
the
record,
that
even
during
the
normal
business
hours
of
8:00
to
4:00
it
takes
an
hour
or
two
to
get
a
warrant.
in
this
case,
i
think
there
was
only--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--he
spoke
generally.
there's
no
specific
information
in
the
suppression
hearing
transcript
about
specifically
how
long
it
would
take
to
get
a
telephone
warrant.
in
this
case,
even
if
it
was
during
normal
business
hours
and
they
had
the
telephone
warrant
available,
the
only
time
there
was
was
the
time
between
the
homicide
detective
at
the
station
got
the
phone
call
from
the
occupant
of
the
lower
unit
to
the
time
that
he...
the
police
officers
actually
converged
on
the
scene.
that
was
an
extremely
short
amount
of
time,
and
no
one,
not
even
respondent,
has
contended
that
in
that
short
time
frame
there
would
have
been
time
to
get
a
warrant
by
any
means,
including
by
telephone.
even
if
exigent
circumstances
did
not
exist
in
this
case,
we
would
submit
that
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
be
applied,
because
olson,
as
an
overnight
guest
in
the
bergstroms'
unit,
did
not
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
the
legal
standard
for
defining
an
expectation
of
privacy,
in
our
view,
should
be
principally
determined
by
whether
the
defendant
had
a
right
to
exclude.
rather
than
revisit
the
reasons
in
our
brief
why
we
maintain
that
that
is
supported
by
history
in
the
text
of
the
fourth
amendment,
i
would
like
to
address
the
principal
argument
by
respondent,
which
is
that
the
right
to
exclude
test
is
simply
inadministerable.
in
our
view
of
this
court's
cases,
that
would
not
be
the
case.
in
fact,
the
court
already
applies
the
right
to
exclude
test,
in...
at
least
as
we
view
it,
in
determining
whether
parties
can
consent
to
a
search.
consent,
or
a
right
to
admit,
is
really
just
the
corollary
or
converse
of
a
right
to
exclude.
put
another
way,
consenting
to
a
search
is
just
another
way
of
saying
that
a
person
has
waived
his
or
her
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
so
that
in
adopting
the
government's
submission,
it
would
be...
all
the
cases
interpreting
consent
searches
would
apply
to
this
case
as
well.
there
is
a
whole
body
of
case
law.
the
right
to
exclude
test
is
also
easier
to
apply
even
in
consent
doctrine
in
joint
control
situations.
because
no
one
has
consented
in
a
case
like
this
one
where
police
think
that
they
have
exigent
circumstances
to
enter,
everyone
who
could
have
consented
to
the
search
has
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
uh-huh.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
well,
in
the
absence
of
the
other
co-tenant
or
occupant
you
have
a...
you
clearly
have
the
right
to
admit
and
exclude.
in
a
joint
control
situation
where...
you
would
also
have
the
right
to
admit
his
guests,
too.
the
only
question
that
arises
in
the
case
law
is
if
you
are
both
present
and
one
says
that
i
want
to
admit
person
x
and
the
other
co-tenant
says
i
want
to
exclude
person
x,
then
you
get
into
a
difficult
situation
of
whose
consent
trumps
another's
but--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--well,
if
you...
for
just
purposes
of
a
thought
experiment,
eliminated
the
other
persons
there,
they
have
a
right
to
admit
or
exclude
on
their...
i
guess
i
don't
fully
understand
the
question
in
that
you
do
have
a
right
to
admit
and
exclude.
it
can
be
subject
to
or
conditioned
by
rights
of
other
people
who
use
the
property,
but
one
doesn't
have
to
get
into
those
sticky
things
for
purposes
of
determining
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy.
because
no
one
has
been
asked
to
admit
a
certain
person
on
the
property,
they
all
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
yes,
and--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--my
answer
to
your
question--
mr.
stephen
j.
marzen
--my
answer
to
the
question
you
gave
my
co-counsel
is
that
olson
would
not...
if
a
stranger
knocked
at
the
door,
olson
would
not
have
had
any
right
to
admit
that
person
and
therefore
would
have
had
no
right
to
exclude
him
or
her
either.
if
a
door-to-door
salesman
had
dropped
by,
or
a
motor
cycle
gang,
or
whomever,
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
allow
them
in
the
house,
no
more
than
if
you
had
a
baby
sitter,
or
a
plumber,
or
anyone
else
working
on
your
home,
that
you
have
given
them
some
part
of
your
right
to
admit
and
exclude
people
so
that
they
can
have
other
parties
on
the
premises.
this
is
not
to
say
that
you
may
not
have...
as
your
agent
you
may
have
told
your
baby
sitter
or
someone
that
you
would
expect
the
plumber
to
come
by
and,
you
know,
they
would
be
able
to
admit
the
person
to
that
extent,
but
they
do
not
have
any
of
your
rights
that
they
are
exercising.
if
the
bergstroms
had
left
olson
at
their
house
while
they
went
to
church
on
sunday
morning,
olson
would
not
have
been
allowed
to
let
people
in.
thank
you.
