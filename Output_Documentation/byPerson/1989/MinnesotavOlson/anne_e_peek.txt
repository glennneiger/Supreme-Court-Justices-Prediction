ms.
anne
e.
peek
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
critical
and
recurring
issues
under
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
u.s.
constitution.
first,
when
does
an
overnight
visitor
have
a
sufficient
expectation
of
privacy
in
a
house
to
enable
him
to
challenge
his
arrest
there?
the
state
contends
that
merely
hiding
overnight
in
a
place
with
permission
of
the
owners
is
not
enough
to
create
a
privacy
expectation.
and
secondly,
is
flight
of
a
dangerous
felon
believed
to
be
armed
an
exigent
circumstance
which
justifies
a
warrantless
arrest?
the
state
contends
that
it
is.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
that's
correct.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
well,
the
respondent
is
claiming
that
his
arrest
was
illegal
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
that
his
statement
was
a
fruit
of
the
illegal
arrest.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
i
suppose
that's
true,
your
honor.
the
state,
however,
has
never--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
ms.
anne
e.
peek
i
suppose
that's
true,
your
honor.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
well,
the
state,
of
course,
has
always
felt
that
this
is
an
admissible
statement
because
the
arrest
was
legal,
and
we've
never
really
argued--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--no.
it
was
never
argued
below
and
we've
never
argued
it
through
the
process,
your
honor.
it's
also
the
state's
position
that
this
court
would
not
need
to
reach
the
exigent
circumstances
issue
if
it
ruled
that
the
respondent
did
not
have
privacy
interest
in
the
home,
also,
and
that's
been
the
state's
main
contention
all
along.
respondent
was
a
getaway
driver
involved
with
his
co-defendant
in
an
armed
robbery
of
a
gas
station
and
the
cold-blooded
murder
of
the
gas
station
attendant.
was
respondent's
temporary
hideout
his
home?
it's
clear
that
a
person
has
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
privacy
in
one's
own
home.
it's
also
clear
that
one
can
have
a
constitutionally
protected
right
to
privacy
in
a
place
other
than
one's
home
under
certain
circumstances.
this
case
is
about
when.
this
court
has
stated--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--i
think
there's
some
expectation,
although
whether
it's--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--well,
i
think
it
depends
on
all
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
certainly,
if
a
visitor...
for
instance
a
relative,
if
i
stay
in
my
parents'
home
for
a
period
of
time,
i
would
have
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
that
home.
however,
if
i
were
just
a
casual
visitor
to
the
home,
my
expectation
of
privacy
would
be
much
less.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
i
agree
with
you
that
a
simple
rule
would
be
nice.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
well,
i
have
two
responses
to
that.
one
is
that
i
think
that
we
probably
don't
want
the
policeman
to
be
making
standing
decisions,
that
in
fact
what
we
would
want
in
the
society
is
for
policemen
to
be
concerned
with
public
safety
issues
and--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--the
police
in
this
case
didn't
get
a
warrant
because
they
felt
that--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--i
think
if
this
case
had
occurred
on
the
weekday
that
they
would
have
done
the
same
thing.
they
were
faced
with
a
murderer,
someone
who
they
felt
was
dangerous,
someone
who
they
felt
was
armed--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--well,
presumptively,
if
the
police
are
entering
the
home
they
want
them
to
get
a
warrant,
that's
right,
but
if--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--well,
that's
correct.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
well,
presumptively
they
should
get
a
warrant
if
they're
going
into
a
private
home.
later--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--well,
that
is...
that
is
the
crux
of
the
issue
in
this
case.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
well,
i
don't
think
they
felt
that
they
were
violating
anyone's
rights
because
they
felt
they
had
exigent
circumstances
to
make
the
warrant--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--no,
no.
what
we've
been
saying
all
along
is
that...
that
we
want
the
policemen
to
concern
themselves
not
with
standing
but
with
probable
cause
and
with
exigent
circumstances
and
the
other
things
that
they
need
to
decide,
and
that
they
should
try
to
proceed
legally
based
on
those
facts.
later,
a
judge
can
decide
whether
or
not
they
were
right,
and
whether
or
not
whose
rights
were--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--well,
the
state
has
never
conceded.
it
hasn't
been
an
issue,
because
there's
been
no
evidence
against
the
owners
and
the
owners
haven't
raised
it.
the
issue
all
along
has
been
the
defendant's
rights,
and
so
the
state
has
never
conceded
that
the
arrest
was
illegal,
but
if
the
arrest
was
illegal,
the
issue
is,
whose
rights
were
violated?
i
think--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
our
position
has
been
that
societal...
the
societal...
public
policy
would
indicate
that
we
do
not
want
policemen
to
make
arrests
based...
to
make
entries
based
on
whether
or
not
someone
has
standing.
we
want
them
to
presumptively
get
a
warrant
if
they
need
to,
and
if
they
don't
need
to
they
go
in,
and
later
they
find
out
who's
in
the
house
and
who
has
interest
and
later
the
court
can
sort
out
who
has
standing
to
object
to
whatever
happens.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
i
don't
think...
i
think
the
problem
is
it's
very
difficult
to...
to
formulate
a
simple
rule
in
this
case.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
i
would
like
to,
if
i
could,
briefly
summarize
why
the
state
should
win
in
both
issues.
with
respect
to
the
privacy
issue,
respondent
has
the
burden
of
proof
to
show
that
he
had
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
duplex.
however,
he
was
not
the
owner,
he
was
not
related
to
the
owner,
he
had
no
key,
he
stayed
there
one
night,
he
had
no
possessions
there
other
than
a
few
clothes,
he
had
no
toothbrush,
he'd
never
slept
there
before,
he
was
never
left
alone
there,
there
was
no
area
designated
for
his
exclusive
use,
and
he
had
no
right
to
exclude
others.
the
most
that
can
be
said
for
respondent
is
that
he
was--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--the
minnesota
supreme
court
did
not
make
a
finding
that
he
had
a
right
to
exclude.
what
it
merely
did
was
state
what
it
said
the
record
said.
however,
the
record
in
fact
did
not
say
that.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
it's
not
a
factual
finding
that's
due
deference
from
this
court.
it
was
merely
a
statement
of
what
the
record
revealed.
if
the
record
is
not
in
fact...
that's
not
in
fact
what
the
record
does
show.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
i
quote
from
the
record:
"and
if
somebody
came
over
to
see
mr.
olson,
did
he
have
your
permission
to
admit
them
or
refuse
to
admit
them?
"
louann
bergstrom
answered,
"i
don't
know.
"
"it
was
never
discussed.
"
question:
"had
somebody
come
over
to
visit
mr.
olson,
would
you
have
allowed
him
to
decide
if
that
person
would
visit
with
him?
"
answer:
"if
i
saw
no
reason
not
to.
"
we
would
contend,
your
honor,
that
that
is
not
the
type
of
right
to
exclude
that
this
court
has
required
in
its
numerous
cases
on
right...
right
to
privacy.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
if
he
and
mrs.
bergstrom
were
in
the
home
and--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--he
may
or
may
not
have
had
the
right
to
exclude
in
that
circumstance,
but
in
this
case
he
was
never
left
alone
so
he
never
had
an
opportunity
to
do
that.
he
was
never...
unlike
jones,
in
the
jones
case,
who
had
a
key
and
who
was
left
alone
in
the
duplex,
he
therefore
could
let
people
in
and
out.
olson
never
had...
he
was
never
left
alone
there,
and
that's...
that's
real
important.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
well,
i
think
it
depends
on
all
the
facts
and
circumstances.
in
this
case--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--no,
not
necessarily.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
well,
we're
saying
that...
that
olson
had
basically
nothing
but
legitimate--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--when
you
are
in
someone
else's
home,
your
right
to
exclude
will
always
be
subservient
to
the
owner's--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--and
certainly
as
long
as
the
owner
is
there.
had
olson
been
left
alone
there,
we
might
have
a
different
case.
we
are
not
saying
that
for
sure
that
the
answer
would
be
different--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--it
has
to
do
with
the
control
that
he
has
of
the
apartment.
in
this
case,
he
was
given
no
express
and
had
no
implied
authority
to
exclude
or--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
anne
e.
peek
i
think
if
he'd
been
alone
that
would
have
been
a
factor
that
would
have
been
in
his
favor.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
all
the
rest
of
the
factors
to
determine
whether
it's
reasonable...
a
reasonable
expectation
that
he
would
have
the
right
to
exclude.
it's
the
state's
position
that
the
right
to
exclude
is
not
the
only
factor
that
should
be
looked
at.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
i
think
that's
true,
your
honor.
certainly,
when
i
give
a
visitor
a
key,
or
i
say,
"make
yourself
at
home;
we're
leaving
for
several
hours.
"
that
type
of
thing
confers
more
authority
and
raises
your
expectation
with
respect
to
your
privacy
in
that
home.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
no,
your
honor,
because
i
think
in
every
case
we
want
the...
we
want
policemen
to
assume
that
the
defendant
has
standing.
we
want
police
to
not
enter
homes
unless
they
have
a
warrant,
unless
they
have
exigent
circumstances
or
some
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement.
we
don't
want
them
to
decide
whether
to
enter
a
home
or
not--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--a
rule
to
that
effect,
that
is
the
rule,
but
presumptively
they
must
have
a
warrant
if
they
enter
a
private
home.
later--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--well,
subject
to
the
exceptions
of
the
warrant
requirement,
in
this
case,
exigent
circumstances
was
the--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--well,
i
think
that
is
the
rule.
that
is
the
rule.
with
respect
to
standing,
the
decision
is
when
the
cops
make
a
mistake
as
to
the
rule,
if
they
violate
the
fourth
amendment,
which
we
do
not
concede
that
they
did
in
this
case,
the
issue
then
is
whose
rights
were
violated?
and
in
this
case
the
state's
contending
that
while
the
bergstroms'
rights,
if
that
arrest
was
illegal,
may
have
been
violated,
the
respondent's
rights
were
not,
because
all
he
could
show
was
legitimately
on
the
premises,
and
that
this
court
has
expressly
rejected
that
as
a
basis
for
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
rakas
case,
and
i
think
subsequent
cases
have
reaffirmed
that
holding.
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
mention
the
exigent
circumstances
case.
it's
the
state's
position
that
the
entry
was
not
illegal
because
respondent
was
armed...
was
dangerous,
believed
to
be
armed,
and
had
been
in
continuous
flight
since
the
crime
had
been
committed,
and
under
those
circumstances...
the
exigent
circumstances...
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement
would
apply.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
not
unusual.
felons
sought
by
police
frequently
do
not
return
to
their
homes
but
hide
out
briefly
with
a
friend,
or
succession
of
friends
to
elude
police.
under
the
minnesota
supreme
court's
holding,
wherever
a
felon
hides
out
overnight
is
his
home
for
fourth
amendment
purposes,
as
long
as
he
has
permission
to
be
there.
to
broaden
fourth
amendment
protection
to
persons
like
respondent
who
have
such
a
tenuous
connection
to
a
place
is
to
severely
hamper
law
enforcement
without
creating
any
meaningful
privacy
protection
increase.
while
felons
deserve
privacy
protection
in
their
homes,
they
should
not
be
allowed
to
use
the
fourth
amendment
as
a
shield
to
escape
apprehension
wherever
they
flea.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
we
do
not
concede
that
the
police
should
not
have
gone
in.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
that's
correct.
ms.
anne
e.
peek
sure
it
is,
because
defendant's...
evidence
taken
out
of
defendant's...
will
not...
his
confession
will
be
suppressed
and
his--
ms.
anne
e.
peek
--he
will
not
be
allowed
to...
the
state
will
not
be
able
to
prosecute
him
for
crimes.
clearly,
the
social
cost
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
such
that
we
have
to
balance
the
law
enforcement
interest
and
the
privacy
interest.
when
the
privacy
interests
are
so
thin,
as
they
are
in
this
case,
the
balance
must
shift
to
law
enforcement.
if
i
may
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal?
ms.
anne
e.
peek
your
honor,
it's
not
the
state's
position
that
mr.
bruder's
privacy
expectations
will
be
eliminated
by...
when
he
stays
with
a
friend.
not
all
guests
have
no
expectation
of
privacy.
it's
important,
however,
to
realize
what
the
facts
were
in
this
case.
in
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
he
slept
on
the
floor.
there
was
no
evidence
that
he'd
been
given
the
run
of
the
place.
although
he
said
that
he
had
permission
to
stay
indefinitely,
the
bergstroms
testified
that
he
asked
if
he
could
stay
a
couple
of
days,
and
louann
bergstrom
testified
that
he
could
stay
until
she
asked
him
to
leave.
he
could
have
been
evicted
at
any
point.
that,
i
think,
is
different
than
the
situation
when
you
stay
at
a
relative's
home,
or
you
stay
at
a
friend's
for
a
specific
length
of
time.
in
this
case,
furthermore,
the
bergstroms
were
asked:
"miss
bergstrom,
counsel
just
said
that
mr.
olson
was
living
there.
"
"was
he
living
there?
"
answer:
"no,
he
wasn't
living
there.
"
"he
stayed
there
one
night.
"
moreover,
it's
true
that
police
bear
a
heavy
burden
when
attempting
to
demonstrate
an
urgent
need
for
a
warrantless
home
entry
arrest...
to
arrest.
such
an
urgent
need
is
shown,
however,
when
police
must
prevent
an
armed
suspect,
wanted
for
murder,
from
escaping
into
the
community.
we
ask
that
this
court
reverse
the
holding
of
the
minnesota
supreme
court.
