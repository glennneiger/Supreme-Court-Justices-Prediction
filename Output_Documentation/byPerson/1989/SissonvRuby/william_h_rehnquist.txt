we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-2041,
everett
sisson
v.
burton
ruby.
mr.
marwedel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
a
kind
of
a
marina,
or
was
it
just
a
single
dock?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
when
you
use
the
term
yacht,
mr.
marwedel,
do
you
mean
something
fairly
specific?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
when
you
say
other,
it
damaged
other
yachts,
you
mean
boats
of
similar
size,
or
much
smaller
size?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
difference
between
a
yacht
and
a
sailboat?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
how
do
we,
very
briefly,
define
a
yacht?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
over
26
feet.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
go
right
down
to
a
rowboat?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
you
have
an
outboard
motor
on
the
rowboat.
is
that...
is
that
clearly
a
vessel?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
you
are
on
an
inland
lake
in
northern
michigan
or
wisconsin
or
minnesota,
and
the
lake
has
no
connection
with
the
river
or
sea
or
anything,
just
say
it's
10
square
miles.
now
is
that
admiralty
jurisdiction?
you're
running
an
outboard
motorboat
on
an
inland
lake?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
said
a
moment
ago,
i
thought,
that
even
an
outboard
on
a
rowboat
on
an
inland
lake
is
not
admiralty
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
depend
on
the...
it
is
a
vessel,
but
it
is
not
on
navigable
water?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
marwedel.
mr.
kopka.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
except
that
the
torts
are
taking
place
on
navigable
water.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then
the
seventh
circuit
would
say
even
though
this
yacht
had
moved
away
from
the
dock,
it
was
not
subject
to
admiralty
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
it
is
not
an
admiralty
jurisdiction
as
it
backs
away
from
the
dock,
unless
there's
a
fire
in
the
washer-dryer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
when
you
require
a
potentially
disruptive
impact
on
maritime
commerce,
you
are
in
effect
saying
that
until
that
happens
the...
the
ship
isn't
in
admiralty
jurisdiction.
yet
you
really
have
to
know
before
that,
don't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
potentially
disruptive
impact
here?
is
it
the
damage
from
the
fire?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
test
is
whether
this
particular
vessel,
if
something
bad
happened
to
it,
would
have
a
potentially
disruptive
impact?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kopka.
mr.
marwedel,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
marwedel.
the
case
is
submitted.
