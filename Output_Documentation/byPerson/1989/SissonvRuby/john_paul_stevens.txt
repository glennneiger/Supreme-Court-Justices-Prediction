anything
in
motion...
supposing
a
pleasure
craft
is
not
moored
as
securely
as
it
should
be,
and
the
ropes
break
in
a
storm
and
it
then
bumps
into
another
boat.
is
that
in
navigation
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
about
your
anecdote.
you...
this...
the
michigan
city
harbor,
i
guess,
they
send
boats
out
and
they
do
fishing.
maybe
that's
not
in
the
record.
and
i
suppose
george
washington
might
have
seen
some
indians
in
canoes
who
were
doing
some
fishing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
would
your
test
apply
to
a
large
pleasure
boat,
then,
used
for
illegal
commercial
activity?
smuggling
drugs
into
the
country,
for
example.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
they
are,
are
they
required
by
statute
to
be
enrolled,
or
is
it
a
voluntary
matter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
is
to
facilitate
the
transfer
of
title
when
you
sell
the
boat,
isn't
it?
