and
if
it
is
navigable
and
you
have
a
smaller
craft,
say
an
outboard
motor
or
a
small
cruiser,
maybe
12-14
feet
long,
and
they
are
pulling
a
water
skier
and
they
run
into
another
water
skier,
and
there
is
serious
personal
injury,
would
the...
under
your
theory
would
the
liability
limitation
act
apply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
the
injured
skier's
recovery
is
limited
to
the
value
of
the
vessel?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
your...
under
your
theory,
what
would
be
the
result
of
my
case?
under
the
theory
you
are
arguing
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
the
only
person
driving
was
the
owner
of
the
vessel,
and
he
injured
somebody
else
that
was
water
skiing,
the
limitation
of
liability
act
would
apply
under
your
submission?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
said
there
is
very
little
chance
he
would
prevail.
let's
have
navigable
water,
a
vessel,
injures
a
water
skier,
invokes
liability
of
limitation
act.
is
there
some
other
way
the
water
skier
can
recover
for
more
than
the
value
of
the
boat
by
alleging
some
other
cause
of
action,
like
negligence
or
something?
was
that
the
purport
of
your
answer
to
me
that
he
might
not
be
successful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
if
the
vessel
is
worth
$12,500,
the
most
the
water
skier
can
recover
is
$12,500?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
there
be
any
principled
basis
for
our
giving
a
more
restrictive
application
to
the
limitation
of
liability
act
than
to
the
jurisdictional
sections,
1333
and
the
extension
act?
