mr.
marwedel,
if
we
were
looking
just
at
section
1333
and
the
question
of
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
courts,
without
regard
for
the
moment
to
whether
the
limitation
of
liability
act
enlarges
at
all
that
jurisdiction,
is
a
traditional
maritime
activity
also
required,
do
you
suppose,
for
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
your
answer
is
yes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
traditional
maritime
activity
is
part
of
the
requirement.
it
isn't
enough
to
have
navigable
water
and
situs.
it
has
to
be
a
traditional
maritime
activity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
we
think--
--you
say...
you
say
without
regard
to
the
limitation
act,
it
is
enough
for
admiralty
jurisdiction
if
there
is
a
vessel
and
if
there
is
navigable
water?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
does
seem
to
go
beyond
the
test
articulated
in
foremost
and
executive
jet
of
anything
having
a
significant
relationship
to
a
traditional
maritime
activity.
it
extends
beyond
that
and
is
more
restrictive,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
appears
to
be
more
restrictive,
and
it's
hard
for
me
to
know
why
a
pleasure
craft
which
is
moored
or
docked
some
place
couldn't
likewise
be
significantly
related
to
a
traditional
maritime
activity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
we
just
did
here
to
the
language
of
this
court's
more
recent
opinions
in
foremost
and
executive
jet,
to
the
effect
that
if
the
activity
has
a
significant
relationship
to
significant...
to
traditional
maritime
activity,
that
is
enough
for
admiralty
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
well,
that
position
is
one
which
mr.
marwedel
says
would
result
in
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
courts
in
this
case,
that
there
needn't
be
movement
of
the
vessel
for
it
to
have
a
significant
relationship
to
traditional
maritime
activity.
is
that
the
point
of
difference,
then?
is
that
what
it
all
boils
down
to?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
movement
or
non-movement.
