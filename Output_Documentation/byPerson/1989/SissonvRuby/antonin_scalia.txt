justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
regulates
mix
masters
too.
i
mean,
you
don't
need
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
for
the
government
to
adopt
safety
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
it
place
these
suits
in
admiralty
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
sort
of
with
you
up
until
the
time
where
you
expressed
doubt
about
a
rowboat.
why
wouldn't
a
rowboat
be
a
vessel?
i
don't
understand
why
you
hesitate.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
applies
whether
the
accident
occurs
on
an
inland
lake
or
not?
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
the
government
says
not.
the
government
says
that
your
theory
produces
different
results,
as
i
recall,
depending
upon
whether
the
water
skier
is
on
the
mississippi
river
or
on
some
land-locked...
land-locked
lake
in
wisconsin.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is...
it
is
your
position
in
this
case,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
however,
that
it
really
doesn't
matter,
that
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
this
is
traditional
maritime
activity
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
the
limitation
act
applies
beyond
admiralty.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what...
does
that
mean
a
corporation
can't
have
privity
and
knowledge?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
a
pleasure
craft
can
affect
commerce
when
it
is
docked
just
as
well
as
when
it
is
moving,
as
the
fire
here
showed.
any...
any
commercial
vessels
that
happened
to
be
on
that
dock
would
have...
would
have
been
effected
by
this
fire,
just
as
any
commercial
vessels
out
in
the
river
or
the
lake
would
have
been
affected
had
the
sailboat
been
moving,
or
had
the
pleasure
boat
been
moving.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that,
but
it
could
have
been.
unless
you
consider
the
head
fishing
boats
to
be
commercial
boats.
are
you
sure
they
are
not
commercial?
justice
antonin
scalia
no...
no
fishing
craft
that
took
out
people
for
daily
fishing
trips?
justice
antonin
scalia
neither
the
constitutional
provision
nor
any
of
the
statutes
modifies
the
word
maritime
by
commercial...
by
the
adjective
commercial.
where
do
you
get
it
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
did
handel
write
his
water
music
for?
was
this
a
commercial
thing
going
down
the
thames,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
believe
that
people
haven't
been
using
the
waterways
for
recreation
for
a
long
time.
you
tell
me
we
just
invented
this,
this
is
a
modern
creation.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
just
make
up
another
adjective.
it
has
to
be
a
lawful
commercial
activity.
i
mean,
you
made
up
the
first
one,
make
up
a
second
one.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
isn't
just
movement.
it
would
also
be
a
traditional
maritime
activity
if
it
occurred
in
the
washer-dryer
unit
on
a
commercial
barge.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
be
more...
i
understand
it
is
not
your
test,
but
the
seventh
circuit,
but
this
potentially
disruptive
effect
on
maritime
commerce.
i
guess
you
would
apply
that
test
where...
where
the
pleasure
craft
is
stationary,
and...
and
the
seventh
circuit
would
apply
it
where
it
is
both
stationary
and
moving?
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
even...
well
even
if
this
fire...
if
the
fire
had
occurred
at
a
commercial
dock.
i
mean,
let's
assume
it's
a
dock
where
there
is
some
pleasure
craft
but
also
commercial
boats.
that
wouldn't
be
a
potentially
disruptive
impact?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
say
the
same
when
it
is
moving
out
in
the...
out
in
the
open
water.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you...
but
you
have
just
told
me
that
where
you
burn
down
the
dock
at
which
commercial
vessels
are
docked
it
doesn't
matter.
i
don't
see
how
that
is
any...
any
better.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
little
inconsistency
there,
isn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
if
there
is
inconsistency
in
treatment
between
pleasure
boats
on
inland
waters
and
pleasure
boats
on
navigable
waters,
there's
also
inconsistency
anyway
between
commercial
boats
in
the
two.
isn't
that
right?
i
mean,
i
assume
you
have
commercial
boats
on
inland...
some
inland
waters.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
are
not
subject
to
admiralty
jurisdiction?
