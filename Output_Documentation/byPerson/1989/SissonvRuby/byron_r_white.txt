is
a
sea
plane
a
vessel?
justice
byron
r.
white
like
if
it
is
taxiing
away
to
make
a
take
off?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
use
it
as
a
basis
for
jurisdiction
of
the
admiralty
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
at
least
it
applies
to
navigable
waters,
you
would
submit?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
there
is
a
vessel.
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
you
use...
suppose
you
are
entitled
to
use
the
limitations
act
in
this
case.
how
about
prevailing
under
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
might
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
think
the
seventh
circuit
would
hold
that
if
this
vessel
were
a
commercial
vessel
and
was
tied
up
at
a
dock
and
had
this
fire,
that
there
would
be
admiralty
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet,
because
this
is
not
a
commercial
vessel,
it...
it
is
not
within...
admiralty
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
under
the
seventh
circuit
test
if
the
yacht
were
just
backing
out
of
the...
backing
away
from
the...
from
the
dock
or
the
pier,
and
the
fire
broke
out
and
there
was
a
lot
of
damage,
it...
it
would
be
within
admiralty
jurisdiction
because
it
would
be
moving.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
if
the
engines
were
just
started
it
would
be
in
navigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
the
boat
for
hire
tied
up
at
the
same
marina.
justice
byron
r.
white

he
might
lose
under
the
limitation
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
confine
richardson
to
its
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
run
into
a
bridge.
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals'
decision?
you
are,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
agree
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
if
the,
if
this
yacht
had
been
just
backing
away
from
its
moorings,
that
would
have
been
navigation
and
admiralty
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
do
you
really
intend
to
say
that
pleasure
craft
shouldn't
be
covered
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you...
how
do
you...
what
principal
distinction
do
you,
can
you
draw
between
a
commercial
craft
that
is
just
sitting
at
a
dock
and
catches
fire,
like
this
one
did,
and
a
pleasure
craft
that
catches
fire,
if
the
test
is
in
navigation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
neither
one
of
them
is
technically
in
navigation
in
the
sense
that
it
isn't...
neither
one
of
them
is
moving.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no,
but
on
that
basis
you
should
enquire
about
a
pleasure
craft
if
it
is
moving
it
isn't
engaged
in
a
commercial
activity.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but,
all
of
a
sudden
it
is
covered
by
admiralty
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
circuit
said...
the
seventh
circuit
test
is
that
if
the
commercial...
if
the
pleasure
craft
is
moving,
there
is
your
admiralty
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there's...
there's
admiralty
jurisdiction
with
a
commercial
craft
even
if
it
isn't
moving.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
commercial
requirement
is
only,
i
take
it
is
only
relevant,
really,
to
a
commercial
ship
that
is
tied
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
because
otherwise
anything
that
is
in
motion
on
navigable
waters
is
covered.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
just
backing
out...
backing
away
from
the
pier
and
the
fire
took
place,
there
is
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
it
started
in
this
washer-dryer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
it's
movement,
as
just...
that's
it,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't.
as
soon
as
it
starts
away
from
the
dock,
whether
there
is
commerce
or
not,
there
is
admiralty
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
i...
sometimes
you
see
it
and
sometimes
you
don't.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
earlier
in
your
submission
all
this
yacht
had
to
be
was
in
motion
and
there
would
be
admiralty
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
that's
what
you
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
then,
if
on
this
yacht...
this
yacht
is
out
in
the
lake,
out
in
the
lake
and
there's
an
accident
on
the
boat,
and
somebody...
a
crew
man
is
injured.
now,
does
that...
is
that
injury
within
admiralty
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
even...
even
under
your
submission
that
would
not
be
covered.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
and
i
am
certain
it
wouldn't
under
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
at
sea,
where
the
pleasure
boats
just
aren't
within...
just
because
they
are
at
sea
aren't
within
admiralty
jurisdiction.
