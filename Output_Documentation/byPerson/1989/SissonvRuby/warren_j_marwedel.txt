mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
september
of
1985
the
petitioner
was
doing
what
all
sailors
have
to
do,
performing
maintenance
on
his
boat.
his
boat
was
docked,
what
we
regard
a
traditional
maritime
activity,
in
a
navigable
waterway
michigan...
in
michigan
city,
indiana,
at
a
pleasure
boating
dock.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
it's
a
marina
that
is
in
part
of
the
harbor
of
michigan
city.
they
have
allocated
part
of
the
harbor...
it
used
to
be
a
commercial
harbor,
part
of
it
now
has
municipal
docks
operated
as
a
marina
for
pleasure
craft,
six-pack
fishing
boats,
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
well,
they
are
commercial
in
the
sense
of
i
may
own
a
boat,
and
if
i
have
a
fishing
license
i
can
take
out
six
people
to
fish
on
lake
michigan,
and
i
charge
them
a
fee
for
taking
them
out.
not
in
the
sense
of
a
commercial
boat
that
brings
it
in
for
restaurants
and
that
sort
of
thing.
that
night
a
fire
broke
out
on
the
boat,
which
has
been
classified
as
one
of
the
main
perils
of
a
boat,
and
it
totally
destroyed
mr.
sisson's
yacht
and
did
considerable
damage
to
other
yachts,
as
well
as
to
marina
property.
a
limitation
of
liability
petition
was
filed
in
the
u.s.
district
court
in
chicago--
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
--it
is
a
56-foot
hatteras
inboard,
twin
screw
motor
yacht,
which
can
be
used
for
cruising
throughout
the
great
lakes.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
yes.
in
fact
the
petitioner's...
or
the
respondents'
yacht
was
of
similar
size.
there
were
some
smaller
yachts,
sailboats,
everything
from
another
56-foot
yacht
to
a
small
sailboat.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
well,
they
are
all
yachts.
i
am
only
describing
the
size.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
well,
i
think
a
yacht...
well,
i
am
a
sailor,
and
generally
we
refer
to
a
yacht
as
something
over
26
feet.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
there
is
no
rule,
but
it's
just
a
term
we
use.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
petition
for
limitation
of
liability
on
the
grounds
there
was
no
subject
matter
admiralty
jurisdiction.
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
courts
is
derived
from
article
3
of
the
constitution
and
the
judicial
power.
it
confers
on
the
courts
the
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction.
today
those
two
terms
are
used
synonymously,
but
in
past
times,
in
colonial
times
and
in
european
times,
the
admiralty
law
generally
dealt
with
just
the
sea,
the
navigable
waters.
the
maritime
law
dealt
with
matters
of
contract,
maritime
liens,
finance,
that
sort
of
thing.
they
have
been
combined
in
article
3
into
one
judicial
power.
in
colonial
times,
as
well
as
in
the...
basically
the
first
180,
190
years
of
this
country,
the
tests
for
admiralty
jurisdiction
was
generally
the
situs
test.
if
the...
if
the
accident
took
place,
or
the
tort
took
place
on
a
navigable
waterway,
it
has
since
been
extended
to
the
great
lakes,
the
western
rivers,
then
you
had
admiralty
jurisdiction.
this
court
had
a
problem
with
that...
with
that
test
the
way
it
had
been
described
in
executive
jet,
where
a
small
commercial
aircraft,
in
taking
off,
struck
some
birds,
essentially
crashed
and
skidded
into
the
water.
the
owners
of
the
aircraft
sued
the
airport
under
admiralty
jurisdiction.
we
believe
that
the
court
rightly
ruled
there
was
no
admiralty
jurisdiction.
but
the
reason
that
we
think
should
have
been
used
is
there
was
no
vessel
involved.
if
you
review
the
tort
cases
in
the
first
180
years
of
admiralty
jurisdiction,
the
facts
disclose
you
have
a
vessel
involved.
it
is
not
just
the
situs.
it
is
not
just
the
navigable
water.
it
takes
both.
and
obviously
an
airplane--
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
--it
can
be,
and
under
the
rules
of
the
road,
if
a
sea
plane
is
operating
on
the
water
as
a
vessel
it
must
comply
with
the
rules
of
a
vessel.
it
has
the
same
navigation
lights,
it
must
follow
the
same
rules
of
the
road.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
that
still
is
under
the
rules
of
the
road.
if
that
sea
plane
just
drops
out
of
the
sky
and
falls
into
the
water,
we
may
have
a
different
result.
that
may
be
the
executive
jet.
it's
a
fortuitous
incident
that
it
landed
in
the
water.
i
think
if
the
focus
is
on
the
vessel,
and
the
u.s.
code
1
u.s.c.
section
3
describes
a
vessel
as
a
water
craft
or
other
contrivance
used
or
capable
of
being
used
as
a
means
of
transportation
on
the
water.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
it
could.
there
are
obviously
situations
that
you
will
get
to
where
you
will
question.
a
rowboat
is...
may
be...
questionable.
but
a
lifeboat
is
a
rowboat,
and
there
are...
a
rowboat
has
to
follow
the
rules
of
the
road.
rowboats
or
lifeboats
have
certain
regulations
on
the
recreational
boating
act.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
yes.
it
is
if
it's
a
water
craft
or
it's
a
contrivance
that
is
designed
for
transportation
on
the
water.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
the
way
the
courts
have
construed
admiralty
jurisdiction,
no,
it
would
not.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
because
it
is
water
that
is
solely
with
the
boundaries
of
the
state.
it
is
not
connected
with
interstate
transportation.
however,
i
think
the
judicial
power
could
extend
that
far
if
the
court
wanted
to.
we
are
not
asking
it
to
in
this
case,
but
i
think
the
judicial
power
for
admiralty
is
different
from
the
commerce
power,
or
the
commerce
clause.
and
if
the
court
saw
fit
to
extent
it,
it
could.
the
federal
government,
in
enacting
the
recreational
boating
act,
has
regulations
for
the
operation
of
boats
and
for
safety
equipment
of
boats,
and
it
just
says
water
in
the
statute.
it
doesn't
restrict
it
to
navigable
waters.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
you
don't...
you
don't
have
to--
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
--you
don't
have
to.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
well,
you
get
to
a
point...
you
get
to
a
point
in...
in...
in
these
types
of
craft
where
you
can
get
to
a
personal
flotation
device.
now,
a
rowboat
i
don't
have
a
problem
with.
then
you
get
to
maybe
a
styrofoam
raft
that
has
a
couple
of
oars
on
it.
i
would
consider
that
to
be
a
personal
flotation
device,
the
way
a
life
jacket
would
be...
or
water
wings.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
well,
because
we
don't
have
a
navigable
water.
the
test--
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
--correct.
i...
i
contend
that
you
need
both.
you
need
a
navigable
water...
for
the
traditional
maritime
activity
that
has
been
exercised
by
this
court,
you
need
a
navigable
waterway
and
you
need
a
vessel.
you
need
those
two
things.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
the
limitation
of--
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
--the
limitation
act
is
slightly
different
from
the
general
maritime,
because
it...
nowhere
in
that
statute
does
it
require
a
navigable
water.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
the
owner
of
the
vessel
is
entitled
to
limit.
the
water
skier
would
not
be.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
it
would
apply.
he
would
have
his
chance
in
court,
although
i
would
admit
that
if
he
is
driving
the
boat
and
there
was
an
error
on
his
part,
there
would
be
very
little
chance
of
his
prevailing
on
his
limitation
action.
but
he
would
be
entitled
to
use
the
limitation
act.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
yes.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
well,
thus
far--
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
--we
are
not
contending,
for
the
purposes
of
our
case,
that
the
limitation
act
does
apply
in
an
inland
lake.
i
am
only
pointing
out
that
there
is
no
language
in
the
statute
that
restricts
it
to
navigable
waters.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
yes.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
and
if
there
is
a
vessel.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
no,
no.
the
limitation
act
would
be
a
defense
to
all
claims
that
would
be
brought.
all
i
am
saying--
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
--only
if
the
vessel
owner
is
able
to
prevail.
i'm
saying
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
the
vessel
owner
to
prevail--
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
--where
he
is
driving
the
boat.
for
example,
if
the
vessel
owner
makes
a
sharp
turn,
causing
the
water
skier
to
have
an
accident,
so
that
it's
operational
negligence
on
behalf
of
the
owner,
who
is
the
operator
as
well,
under
the
provisions
of
the
limitation
act
he
couldn't
limit,
because
he
has
privity
and
knowledge
of
the
proximate
cause
of
the
accident.
but
he
has
an
opportunity
to
at
least
present
his
case
in
the
limitation
action
in
federal
court.
now,
if
the
accident
were
caused
by
some
other...
some
other
reason
that
was
not
within
his
privity
and
knowledge,
for
example
he
is
going
along
in
clear
open
waters
and
there
is
an
underwater
obstruction
that
caused
his
vessel
to
veer
off,
then
he
would
be
entitled
to
limit,
because
it
was
not
within
his
privity
and
knowledge.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
well,
in
this
particular
case
we
have
a--
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
--we
would
hope
to
prevail.
what
we
have
to
do
is
establish--
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
--but
we
might
not.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
it
goes
to
what
the
proximate
cause
of
the
accident
was
and
did
we
have
privity
and
knowledge
of
that
proximate
cause.
in
our
brief
we
use
the
analogy
of
the
automobile.
if
i
am
driving
the
automobile,
or
i
am
driving
the
boat,
and
i
cause
the
accident,
i
may
be
able
to
get
into
court
under
the
limitation
act,
but
i
am
probably
going
to
lose.
however,
if
i
lend
my
boat
to
somebody
else,
or
lend
my
car
to
somebody
else,
and
it
is
their
negligence
that
causes
the
accident,
i,
as
the
owner,
would
be
entitled
to
limit.
the
driver
of
the
boat
would
not.
so
that
the
injured
party
would
have
a
claim
against
the
driver
of
the
boat.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
this
was
first
articulated
in
the
executive
jet
decision
and
then
again
in
the
foremost
decision.
and
it's
our
contention
that
the
operation
of
a
vessel,
as
defined
by
the
statute,
is
the
most
traditional
maritime
activity.
the
eighth
circuit,
subsequent
to
executive
jet--
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
--yes.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
that's
what
the
test
has
been
subsequent
to
executive
jet
and
foremost.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
i
accept
it,
except
as
to
how
that
is
defined.
and
that
is
what
has
caused
the
lower
courts
so
much
confusion.
the
seventh
circuit
essentially
restricted
it
to
navigation,
but
that's
not
all
vessels
do.
a
vessel
can
be
in
navigation
without
actually
moving
through
the
water.
as
long
as
it
is
fit,
manned
and
it
is
ready
to
go,
it
is
in
navigation
until
such
time--
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
--yes.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
basically
that
is
correct.
but
this
court
in
foremost
indicated
that
the
commercial
activity
of
the
vessel
wasn't
the
test.
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
admiralty
courts
in
colonial
times
was
to
control
the
water,
whatever
moved
on
the
water.
these...
to
look
at
just
a
commercial
nexus,
you
would
have
to
look
at
what
is
going
on
in
this
vessel.
what
if
the
next
morning
we
were
going
to...
the
system
was
going
to
take
out
six
fishermen,
and
charge
them
all
$100
apiece
to
go
fishing?
we
would
wind
up
having
to
have
a
mini
trial
for
every
case
to
determine
what
the
traditional
maritime
activity
was.
and
that's
why
we
feel
that
the
operation
of
a
vessel,
whatever
a
vessel
does
on
the
water,
is
a
traditional
maritime
activity
by
definition.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
correct.
as
long
as
there...
it's
a
vessel.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
additionally.
beyond
admiralty,
the
limitation
act
would
also
give
you
jurisdiction.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
yes.
we
get
the
same
result
with
that
test
in
executive
jet,
and
we
get
the
same
result
with
that
test
in
foremost.
it...
we
would
not
disturb
any
of
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
going
back
and
looking
at
all
of
them,
involve
a
navigable
water
and
a
vessel.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
because
it
was
moving.
and
i
think
that
is
starting
to
split
hairs.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
yes.
well,
i
don't
know
with
what
their...
i
would
assume
that
they
are
looking
at
movement
through
the
water.
but
if
that
becomes
a
test,
you
have
a
problem
with
all
sorts
of
vessels
that
are
not
pleasure
craft,
but
not
commercial
vessels.
you
have
government
vessels,
you
have
from
the
federal
government,
the
state
governments,
the
city
governments.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
exactly.
and
you
could
have
a
fire
that
would
do
damage
to
all
sorts
of
different
types
of
boats
and
have
all
sorts
of
different
types
of
jurisdiction.
and
i
think
for
uniformity
on
the
navigable
waters
that
the
test
of
a
vessel
in
navigable
water
is
sufficient
to
keep
out
the...
if
it's
not
a
vessel
it
is
probably
not
a
traditional
maritime
activity,
but
there
may
be
some.
the
sea
plane,
for
example,
is
a
bridge
between
the
vessel
and
the
airplane,
so
at
some
point
it
is
a
traditional
maritime
activity
if
it
is
operating
as
a
vessel.
if
it
is
flying
in
the
air
it
is
not.
we
also
feel
that
our
test
is
in
agreement
with
what
congress
has
done
in
the
extension
act,
where
they
extend
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
to
vessels,
without
describing
the
type
of
vessel,
on
navigable
waters.
it's
consistent
with
the
wording
in
the
limitation
act
which
refers
to
vessels.
and
again,
we
don't
feel
that
it
would
cause
this
court
to
have
to
overrule
any
prior
decisions,
so
that
roughly
200
years
of
maritime
jurisprudence
would
stay
intact
with
our
definition.
the
limitation
act
provides
a
separate,
as
i
have
already
indicated,
a
separate
basis
of
jurisdiction.
we
feel
that
that
was
confirmed
in
the
richardson
v.
harmon
case,
and
it
has
been
confirmed
again
in
the
supplemental
rules
that
were
propounded
by
this
court,
the
supplemental
admiralty
rules,
which
conferred
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
court
to
hear
limitation
of
liability
cases.
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
just
a
couple
of
points
that
i
wanted
to
make
clear.
i
believe
that
the
law
is
very
clear
that
a
corporation
can
be
found
to
have
privity
and
knowledge
of
the
proximate
cause
of
an
accident,
and
that
a
corporation
could
not
limit,
as
happened
in
the
seventh
circuit,
or
the
district
court,
rather,
in
in
re
amoco
kadiz,
where
the
amoco
corporation
was
found
to
have
privity
and
knowledge
and
not
able
to
use
the
limitation...
or
have
limitation
for
the
oil
spill.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
that
was
before
judge
magar
in
chicago,
the
district
court.
second,
we
are
not
urging
that
the
limitation
action
statute
be
applied
on
inland
lakes.
i
was
only
pointing
out
that
the
statute...
the
words
in
the
statute
and
in
the
supplemental
admiralty
rules
don't
require
navigable
waters.
they
don't
use
the
phrase;
they
just
use
water.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
you
do,
for
example
lake
geneva
in
wisconsin
has
a
sightseeing
boat
that
also
carries
the
u.s.
mail
and
picks
people
up
from
the
train
station
and
takes
them
around
the
lake
and
there
are
four
drop
off
points.
that
is
a
lake
that
is
wholly
within
the
state
of
wisconsin.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
as
far
as
i
know
that's
never
been
determined
by
anyone.
the
issue
hasn't
come
up.
i
had
one,
but
it
got
settled.
secondly,
phenix,
we
feel,
was
out
of
step
with
richardson
and
butler
and
hamilton.
phenix
was
a
case
where
it's
really
form
over
substance.
the
court
found
there
was
no
jurisdiction
under
the
limitation
action
because
of
the
place
that
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
this
has
been
subsequently
corrected
in
the
supplemental
rule
f,
paragraph
9,
which
allows
the
limitation
action
to
be
filed
where
the
vessel
is,
where
the
owner
has
been
sued,
where
the
vessel
has
been
arrested,
or
any
other
district
court.
at
the
time
of
phenix
there
were
the
admiralty
rules
that
were
more
restrictive
as
to
venue,
so
that
in
a
sense
the
venue
became
jurisdictional,
that
the
lawsuit
then
had
to
be
filed
someplace
else
but
not
in
the
court
that
was
addressing
the
phenix
case.
recreational
boats
are
a
matter
of
federal
concern,
and
congress
has
passed
many
regulations
concerning
the
operation,
safety,
fire
fighting,
life
saving,
et
cetera,
for
the
pleasure
craft.
in
fact,
46
u.s.c.,
under
the
recreational
boating
act,
preempts
state
law
on
the
regulation
and
operation
of
boats.
it
will
allow
state
law
to
have
the
same
requirement
that
the
federal
law
requires,
but
no
more.
the
u.s.
coast
guard
has
a
life-saving
station
at
michigan
city
which
was
right
next
to
this
marina.
if
there
has
to
be
an
impact
on
commerce,
we
have
a
fire
in
the
middle
of
the
night.
as
i
understand
the
people
that
were
awakened,
sleeping
on
their
boats,
was
immediately
to
get
their
boats
out
of
the
way,
to
get
away
from
the
flames.
there
was
an
oil
line
that
went...
a
gasoline
line
that
went
right
under
the
dock
in
front
of
our
boats.
people
were
afraid
that
that
was
going
to
blow
up.
if
the
fire
had
spread
it
could
have
gone
right
to
the
coast
guard
station,
which
is
situated
literally
at
the
end
of
this
dock,
and
that
provides
the
life
saving
for
commercial
as
well
as
recreational
craft.
that
coast
guard
station
also
supervises
the
navigational
aids
in
that
part
of
the
lake.
as
far
as
the
number
of...
of
boats,
recreational
boats
that
we
have
now
or
in
the
time
of
washington,
the
boats
that
were
registered
in
washington's
time,
i
assume,
because
there
was
a
statute,
were
registered
with
the
u.s.
government,
as
mr.
sisson's
boat
was.
it
was
enrolled
under
the
laws
of
the
united
states
with
the
u.s.
coast
guard.
today
we
have
statistics
that
go
beyond
the
vessels
that
are
enrolled,
your...
usually
your
rowboat
or
your
small
sailboat
are
not
enrolled
with
the
coast
guard,
but
large
vessels
such
as
this
are.
this
is
a
boat
that
is
designed,
as
any
commercial
ship
is,
for
people
to
literally
live
on.
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
in
most
instances
it
is
a
voluntary
matter.
you
get
to
a
certain
size
and
use,
i
am
not
that
familiar
with
the
statute,
but
you
get
to
the
point
where
you
have
to.
also,
when
you--
mr.
warren
j.
marwedel
--correct.
and
most
lending
institutions,
boats
of
this
size
are...
usually
you
borrow
money
to
buy
a
boat
of
this
size,
so
the
lending
institutions
require
that
you
have
this
type
of
enrollment.
we
also
get...
if
we
are
going
to
look
at
commerce,
which
is
not
set
out
in
any
of
the
statutes,
and
in
the
history
of
the
admiralty
side
of
the
court,
commerce
was
not
the
issue.
commerce
is
mentioned
as
the
underpinning
originally
for
the
limitation
act,
which
has
been
amended
many
times
in
the
last
century
and
in
this
century.
congress
has
never
amended
it
to
include
congress.
it
includes
pleasure
craft,
in
spite
of
lower
courts
suggesting
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
should
not
be
extended
to
pleasure
craft.
congress
has
never
amended
out
the
inclusion
of
all
vessels
on
all
waters.
but
what
is
commerce?
these
boats
now
are...
are
built
all
over
the
country.
we
see
them
go
down
our
highways.
there
is
not
admiralty
jurisdiction
yet,
but
they
are
in
the
stream
of
commerce.
they
are
bought
and
sold,
they
are
insured,
they
buy
fuel,
they
pay
taxes.
people
hire
crew
members
to
work
on
pleasure
craft.
mr.
trump's
yacht's
got
a
crew
that
is
paid.
that
is
a
very
large
yacht,
but
it
is
still
a
pleasure
craft.
i
would
suggest
that
all
of
these
boats
are
part
of...
part
of
commerce.
we
are
a
changing
society.
we
are
becoming
a
service
society,
we
are
becoming
a
society
that
has
a
lot
of
recreation.
it
is
big
business
in
this
country.
and
it
is
using
the
natural
resource,
the
resource
that
the
admiralty
courts
used
to
supervise.
the
commercial
court,
which
you
will
find
still
in
europe...
there
used
to
be
a
distinction
where
matters
that
happened
on
the
water
involving
vessels
were
handled
in
the
admiralty
court.
matters
involving
loss
of
cargo,
liens,
contracts,
bills
of
lading,
were
handled
in
a
commercial
court.
in
this
country
it
is
all
combined
together.
i
submit
that
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
under
the
constitution
extends
to
navigable
waters
for
all
purposes.
it
has
been
traditionally
used
and
extended
to
vessels
operating
on
navigable
waters.
we
submit
that
our
vessel
was
in
fact
in
navigation,
although
it
was
not
navigating
through
the
water.
it
was
crewed,
it
was
manned,
it
was
ready
to
go.
that
it
is
a
vessel,
it
is
on
a
navigable
water,
it
should
be
covered
by
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
and
we
ask
that
the
court
reverse
the
seventh
circuit.
