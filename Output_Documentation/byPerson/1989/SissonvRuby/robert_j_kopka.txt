mr.
robert
j.
kopka
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
the
respondent.
with
respect
to
the
facts
as
stated
by
the
petitioner,
i
would
only
add
that
after
the
occurrence
the
petitioner's
yacht
was
worth
$800
in
salvage
value.
the
fire
caused
$275,000
worth
of
damage
to
the
other
boats
and
to
the
municipal
marina,
and
what
petitioner
is
seeking
to
do
is
to
limit
his
liability
for
$275,000
worth
of
damage
to
$800.
we
believe
that
there
are
two
issues
addressed
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
he
may
lose
under
the
limitation
act.
however,
the
description
provided
to
the
court
of
what
is
privity
and
knowledge
was
somewhat
inaccurate.
privity
and
knowledge
is
not
the
same
as
negligence.
and
a
common
law
action
under
state
law
for
negligence
is
something
different
than
proving
privity
and
knowledge.
for
example--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--an
owner
of
a
vessel...
counsel
gave
an
example
of
an
owner
of
a
vessel
versus
an
owner
of
a
car.
an
owner
of
a
vessel
may
have
no
privity
and
knowledge,
although
his
employee
is
negligent
or
is...
has
privity
and
knowledge
which
gives
rise
to
the
occurrence,
whereas
under
common
law
or
state
tort
law,
one
might
have
vicarious
liability
for
the
actions
of
an
employee.
so
you
have
a
difference
in
applying
the
admiralty
law
when
you
have
an
employee
who
is
either
negligent
or
has
privity
and
knowledge,
as
compared
to
on
the
land,
where
you
would
have
vicarious
liability
by
operation
of
state
law.
i
think
that
there
are--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
a
corporation
would
not
have
privity
and
knowledge
in...
in
the
admiralty
context,
and
would
then
be,
the
limitation
of
liability
would
be
available
notwithstanding
the
privity
and
knowledge
issue.
another
issue
which
was
raised
by
counsel
which
i
think
is
a
problem
for
counsel
is
this.
counsel
claims
that
the
limitation
of
liability
act
doesn't
say
anything
about
navigable
waterway.
and
that
issue
was
raised
in
several
courts
below
and
it
was
rejected.
but
what
counsel
would
urge
this
court
to
do
is
to
allow
application
of
the
limitation
of
liability
act
even
on
non-navigable
waterways,
such
as
inland
lakes.
and
by
doing
so,
under
counsel's
argument,
there
would
be
admiralty
jurisdiction
to
every
body
of
water,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
is
navigable
or
non-navigable,
by
virtue
of
the
limitation
of
liability
act.
this
wasn't
the
intent
of
congress
in
drafting
the
limitation
of
liability
act.
in
fact,
this
court
early
on
stated
that
the
limitation
of
liability
act
is
a
part
of
the
general
maritime
laws.
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
requirements
of
general
admiralty
jurisdiction
should
be
applied
to
the
limitation
of
liability
act,
just
as
it's
applied
to
every
other
general
admiralty
case
coming
before
the
federal
courts.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
the
admiral...
admiralty
courts
of
the
united
states
have
a
certain
expertise
and
interest
in
matters
which
are
strictly
admiralty.
and
what
has
happened
in
the
recent...
past,
is
that
with
a
proliferation
of
pleasure
craft
upon
the
waterways,
the
federal
courts
are
being
confronted
with
common
law,
garden
variety
tort
cases
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
traditional
maritime
activity
which
this
court
required
for
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
executive
jet
case.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
no.
i
think
that
the
jurisdictional
aspects
are
the
same.
in
other
words,
the
limitation
of
liability
act,
being
a
part
of
the
general
admiralty
laws,
should
apply
similarly.
the
only
other
restriction
would
be
the
language
of
the
act
itself.
and,
accordingly,
one
of
the
issues
that
was
asked
of
us
to
brief
was
the
issue
of
the
case
of
richardson
v.
harmon.
counsel
mentioned,
by
the
way,
that
there
are
no
cases
which
would
be
disturbed
by
counsel's
vessel
test,
and
i
point
out
that
in
re
phenix,
the
case
preceding
richardson
v.
harmon,
indeed
involved
a
vessel,
and
yet
this
supreme
court
found
that
there
was
no
admiralty
jurisdiction
at
that
time.
we
believe
that
the
richardson
case
does
not
hold
broadly
that
there
is
a
separate
species
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
under
the
limitation
of
liability
act.
we
believe
that
if
the
supreme
court
in
richardson
had
intended
a
separate
species
or
a
separate
vehicle
to
obtain
jurisdiction
through
the
federal
courts
it
would
have
said
so.
it
did
not.
instead
it
construed
section...
what
is
now
called
section
189
of
the
limitation
of
liability
act,
to
include
damage
which
occurs
to
structures
upon
the
land,
whereas
prior
to
the
enactment
of
section
189,
such
damage
was
not
covered
under
section
189...
or
under
the
limitation
of
liability
act.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
i
would
confine--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--that's
correct.
which,
of
course,
has
been
codified
in
the
extension
of
admiralty
act.
however,
i
would
like
to
address
the
possibility
that
this
court
would
see
richardson
more
broadly
than
that.
and
if
this
court
does
construe
richardson
to
supply
a
vehicle
for
federal
admiralty
jurisdiction,
even
when
the
other
requirements
of
federal
jurisdiction
are
absent,
meaning
today
that
there
is
no
navigable
water
location,
or
that
there
is
no
significant
contact
to
traditional
maritime
activity,
then
richardson
should
be
reconsidered
in
light
of
what
has
occurred
in
modern
day.
and
that
is
what
i
have
previously
mentioned,
which
is
the
proliferation
of
pleasure
craft,
and
accordingly,
the
proliferation
of
common
variety
torts
being
litigated
in
an
admiralty
court
which
has
no
interest
in
those
torts.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
indeed.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
i
do.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
i
think
that
there
would--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--no,
we
are
not
taking
the
position
that
pleasure
craft
should
not
be
covered
at
all,
because,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
foremost
case,
a
collision
between
two
pleasure
craft
may
have
a
significant
impact
upon
maritime
commerce.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
the
test
would
be
a
two-fold
test,
your
honor.
the
first
inquiry...
pardon
me.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
no,
but
if
you
have
a
commercial
maritime
activity,
and
i
would
suggest
that
a
commercial
craft,
even
docked,
is
engaged
in
a
commercial
maritime
activity.
for
example
a
tanker
which
is
docked
and
is
either
being
loaded
with
cargo
or
cargo
is
being
loaded
off
of--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--correct.
the
difference
is--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--and
the
reason
is
because
the
federal
government
and
the
federal
judiciary
have
an
interest
in
protecting
commercial
navigation.
and
because
two
pleasure...
even
pleasure
craft
in
navigation
may
have
a
significant
impact
upon
the
commercial
activity,
or
the
commercial
navigation,
that
would
be
governed--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--the
seventh
circuit--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
commerce
is
the
key
element
which
provides
the
foundation
for
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
first
of
all,
there
were
no
commercial
vessels
on
this
dock,
but--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
were
any
commercial
vessels
on
this
particular
dock.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
that,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
however,
let
me
respond
to
your
point,
which
is
that
a
pleasure
yacht
may
have
an
impact
upon
commercial
activity
if
it
is...
even
if
it
is
docked.
and
my
response
to
that
is
as
follows.
that
the
decisions
of
this
court
in
executive
jet
and
in
foremost,
and
the
sisson
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit,
instructs
the
district
courts
to
look
at
the
wrong,
what
they
call
the
wrong.
and
i
would
call
that
the
offending
vessel,
meaning
the
vessel
where
the
fire
started,
or
the
vessel
which
causes
the
collision,
or
the
vessel
which...
on
which
the
tort
occurs.
and
by
focusing
upon
the
wrong,
we
recognize
that
the
purpose
of
federal
case
law
is
to
affect
the
conduct
of
parties
engaged
in
everyday
activities,
for
example,
navigation
through
navigable
waterways.
in
an
instance
where
a
pleasure
craft
may
have
an
impact
upon
commercial
activity,
although
it
is
not
in
navigation,
there
would
be
no
federal
interest
in
the
conduct
of
that
particular
pleasure
craft,
even
though
it
may
have
an
effect
upon
commercial
navigation,
so
that
there
would
be
no
federal
jurisdiction.
which
is
not
to
suggest
that
there
wouldn't
be
jurisdiction
under
the
state
courts.
there
clearly
would.
and
for
any
tort
committed
by
that
pleasure
craft,
there
would
be
jurisdiction
for
any
potential
state
tort
law
liability,
and
it
may
very
well
be
that
federal
standards
are
admissible
in
the
federal...
in
the
state
law--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--that
is
correct.
that
is
how
i
understand
the
seventh
circuit's
decision,
which
is
i
think
consistent
with--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--anything
in
motion
would
be
covered,
and
if
it
was
any
effect
at
all
on
commercial
activity,
there
would
be
no
principled
basis
upon
which
to
draw
a
line.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
i
would
say
that
it
is.
i
would
suggest
that
navigation
is
any
movement
through
a
body
of
water.
and,
accordingly,
that
would
be
navigation
without
a
pilot,
i
suppose.
the
seventh
circuit's
test,
i
think,
is
a
principled
approach,
because
it
recognizes
the
foundation
upon
which
admiralty
law
is
based.
and
that
foundation
is
commerce.
there
is
a
balance
which
must
be
done
by
this
court,
and
that
is
the
balance
between
the
federal
interest
in
regulating
maritime
commerce,
and
the
states'
rights
to
adjudicate
common
law
tort
liability.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
i
don't
think
so.
i
would
suggest
that
it
defines
what
foremost--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--if
the
pleasure
craft
which
is
moored
or
docked
is
in
any
way
involved
in
a
commercial
maritime
activity
itself,
then
even
under
the
seventh
circuit's
decision,
it
would
provide
the
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction.
so
we
are
only
dealing
with
the
subsection
of
pleasure
craft
which
are
not
themselves
involved
in
commercial
maritime
activity.
and
the
question
that
the
seventh
circuit
answered
is
in
what
cases,
in
what
types
of
situation,
in
what
principled
approach
will
we
apply
to
answer
the
question
of
when
pleasure
craft,
non-commercially
related,
should
provide
the
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction,
when
would
they
have
the
significant
maritime
activity.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
well,
to
start
out,
it
comes
from
this
court's
decisions
in
executive
jet
and
foremost.
but
the
reasons
for
the
addition
of
this,
what
we
call
the
nexus
test,
were
laid
out
in
executive
jet
and
foremost.
and
the
reason
is
that
when
those
statutes
and
when
the
constitution
was
drafted
there
was
no
concept
of
anything
other
than
commercial
activity
upon
the
navigable
waterways.
we
recite
in
our
briefs
some
statistics--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--at
the
time
that
we
were
talking
about
the
navigable
waterways,
which
at
the
time
were
waterways
subject
to
the
tides.
so
we
would
be
dealing
with
essentially
international
commerce.
even
when
the
waterways
subject
to
admiralty
jurisdiction
were
redefined
to
include
navigable
waterways
in
the
united
states,
we
are
talking
about
commercial
activity
upon
those
waterways.
and--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--it
is...
this
is
a
modern
creation
which
this
court
invented
in
1973,
but
i
will,
if
i
may
be
permitted
an
anecdote,
i
was
at
mount
vernon
yesterday
and
i
was
standing
where
george
washington's
porch
is,
and
i
saw
literally
hundreds
of
pleasure
craft.
and
i
recognized
that
george
washington
couldn't
have
seen
anything
like
that
in
his
day.
my
suggestion
is
that,
and
the
statistics
which
we
supplied
in
our
brief
suggest,
that
at
the
turn
of
this
century
there
weren't
more
than
1,000
pleasure
craft
in
these
united
states,
whereas
in
1987
there
were
estimated
to
be
17
million
pleasure
craft
upon
the
united
states.
so
the
question
of
when
the
federal
government
will
have
jurisdiction
over
a
common
law
tort,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
commercial
activity,
wasn't
foreseeable
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
drafted.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
that
may
be
the
case.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
that's
true.
i
don't
know,
to
answer
your
question,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
know
of
any
cases
that
really
address
the
question
of
common
law
torts
on
pleasure
craft,
and
whether
they
apply
to
the
federal
admiralty
jurisdiction,
until
the
relatively
recent
past,
other
than
those
cases
in
which
the
limitation
of
liability
act
was
sought
to
be
imposed.
and
in
those
cases
the
limitation
of
liability
act
in
phenix
did
not
provide,
according
to
this
court,
a
separate
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction.
only
in
richardson
v.
harmon,
which
is
one
case
somewhat
different
from
all
of
the
other
cases
decided
under
the
limitation
of
liability
act,
did
this
court
grant
federal
admiralty
jurisdiction.
and
i
suggest
that
under
the
aegis
of,
and
the
test
laid
down
by
the
executive
jet
and
the
foremost
cases,
that
richardson
v.
harmon
would
not
apply
today,
because
the
nexus
requirement,
the
requirement
that
there
be
a
significant
connection
to...
traditional
maritime
activity,
would
not
be
applied
to
a...
to
a
non
traditional
and
a
common
law,
garden
variety
tort.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
interesting
question.
i
wonder
whether...
i
question
whether
smuggling
drugs
is
a
commercial
activity,
and
i
suppose
that
it
may...
it
may
be.
although
this
would
point
out,
i
suppose,
the
injustice
of
permitting
a
limitation
of
liability
act
in
such
a
situation.
[laughter]
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
the
requirement
that
there
be
a
commercial
activity
is
not
one,
i
don't
think,
with
respect,
justice
scalia,
which
was
made
up.
i
think
that
it
was
a
recognition
that
commercial
activity
is
the
foundation
upon
which
admiralty
jurisdiction
applies,
and
with
respect
to
states'
rights
to
adjudicate
garden
variety
torts,
torts
which
do
not
have
any
basis,
in
which
the
federal
judiciary
doesn't
have
any
special
interest.
what
this
court
recognized
in
foremost--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--yes,
but
the
question
of
whether
admiralty
jurisdiction
applies
to
anything
occurring
on
navigable
waterway
was
addressed
by
executive
jet
and
rejected.
and
i
would
submit
that
my
esteemed
opponent's
recommendation
that
jurisdiction
apply
to
anything
on
navigable
waterway
upon
a
vessel
is
really
a
return
to
the
days
prior
to
executive
jet
when
any
occurrence
upon
a
navigable
waterway
would...
would
permit
federal
admiralty
jurisdiction.
i
think--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--i
fully
support
that
position,
and
i
suggest
that--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--i
believe
it
does.
it
boils
down--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--i
think
it
boils
down
to
something
a
little
bit
broader
than
movement
or
non-movement,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
it
boils
down
to
a
definition
of
traditional
maritime
activity.
and
what
mr.
marwedel
would
suggest
in
this
case
is
that
a
fire
which
started
in
a
washer-dryer
unit
is
traditional
maritime
activity,
just
because
it
happened
to
be
upon
a
yacht
which
was
docked.
if
that
fire
had
started
in
a
washer-dryer
unit
in
a
mobile
home,
there
wouldn't
be
any
question
of
traditional
maritime
activity.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
because
there
was--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--because
there
would
be
a
significant
impact,
and
only
if
there
is
a
significant
impact.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
that's
right.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
that
is
correct.
and
again,
the
reason
is
because
commerce
is
the
key
which
is
the
foundation
to
federal
expertise.
what
is
the
reason--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--correct.
but
the
reason
that
navigation
is
one
basis
of
federal
admiralty
jurisdiction--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--i
think
you
see
it
in
every
case,
justice.
i
think
that
you
see
it
any
time
you
have
navigation.
and
the
reason
is
because
any
navigation
upon
navigable
waterways
may
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
commercial
activity
on
those
waterways.
what
the
seventh
circuit
required
was
both
navigation
and
a
potentially
disruptive
impact
upon
maritime
commerce.
so
that
any
navigation
by
itself,
in
the
absence
of
an
impact
or
a
potential
impact
on
maritime
commerce,
would
not
serve
to
provide
a
basis
for
admiralty
jurisdiction.
the
reason
for
that,
again,
is
a
recognition--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--that's
correct.
what
the
seventh
circuit
said
was
that
in
order...
if
you
have
a
non-commercial
vessel
you
must
find
both
that
the
tort
involves
navigation
and
a
potentially
disruptive
impact
upon
maritime
commerce.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
well,
i
would
go
further
than
that,
and
say
unless
there
is
a
potentially
disruptive
impact
upon
maritime
commerce.
because
only
with
a
potentially
disruptive
impact
upon
maritime
commerce
is
the
federal
interest
in...
in
protecting
maritime
commerce
arise.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
you
have
to
know
before...
the
potential--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--it...
it
was
the
damage
which
may
arise
as
a
result
of
the
fire.
the
seventh
circuit
provided
an
example
in
its
decision.
the
example
it
provided
was
that
if
the
fire
spread
across
oil-covered
water
and
blocked
a
channel
which
was
used
by
commercial
vessels,
then
that
would
be
a
potentially
disruptive
impact
upon
maritime
commerce.
but
in
another
situation
where
it
was
simply
backing
out
of
a
dock,
there
were
nothing
but
pleasure
boats
in
the
area,
there
was
no
potential
disruption--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--that
is
not...
that
is
not--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--but
that
is
not
the
position
that
the
seventh
circuit
took.
i
would
take
the
position
that
all
it
has
to
be
is
in
motion.
the
seventh
circuit
took
a
more...
a
more
restrictive
approach.
the
seventh
circuit
took
the
approach
that
it
has
to
be
both
in
motion
and
have
a
potentially
disruptive
impact
upon
maritime
commerce.
i
would
restrict
it
to
navigation
any
time
it's
in
motion,
because
in
the
foremost
decision,
which
this
court
rendered
in
1983,
there
really
was
no
discussion
of
a
potentially
disruptive
impact
on
maritime
commerce
in
the
facts
of
that
case,
although
this
court
did
say
in
that
case
that
navigation
would
provide
a
basis
of
federal
admiralty
jurisdiction
because
of
the
potentially
disruptive
impact
that
a
collision
between
two
pleasure
craft
may
have
on
maritime
commerce.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
that
is
the
seventh
circuit's
test.
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
i
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
an
accident
on
a
boat
is
no
different
than
an
accident
in
a
home
or
an
accident
in
a
store.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
it
would
not
be
covered,
and--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--but
that's
correct.
and
even
under
my
submission
it
would
not.
and
the
reason
that
it
would
not
is
because
the
wrong
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
it
was
involved
in
navigation,
unless
the
facts
indicated
that
it
was.
we
have
a
case
currently
pending
in
the
ninth
circuit
in
which
the
plaintiff
slipped
and
fell
upon
a
pleasure
boat
which
happened
to
be
docked.
the
limitation
of
liability
act
was
asserted
by
the--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--no.
i
would
suggest
that
the
concept
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
is
not
geographic.
and
i
think
that
that
was
recognized
by
this
court
in
executive
jet,
that
geographic
jurisdiction
under
the
federal
courts
really
doesn't
exist.
it
is
more
constitutional
jurisdiction.
so
that
it
is
concurrent
with
the
state's
geography,
and
yet
it
arises
only
when
a
federal
interest
is...
is
impacted.
and
in
this...
in
this
case
i
was
going
to
say
the
federal
interest
is
maritime
commerce.
it
is
now
and
it
has
been
since
the
day
of
the
constitution.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
no.
i
would
not
apply
it
when
the
pleasure
craft
is
stationary,
because
when
a
pleasure
craft
is
stationary
it,
it
being
the
offending
vessel,
then
it
would
have
no
impact...
no
potentially
disruptive
impact
upon
maritime
commerce,
even
involve
navigation.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
that,
i
suppose,
would
be
a
potentially
disruptive
impact.
however,
the
offending
vessel
being
a
pleasure
craft,
there
again
would
be
no
federal
interest
in
regulating
the
conduct
of
that
offending
vessel.
the
purpose,
it
seems
to
me,
of
case
law
is
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
individuals
involved
in
activities.
the
individual
in
that
scenario
would
be
an
owner
of
a
pleasure
craft.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
but
out
in
the
open
water
you
have
the
peril
of
a
collision
between
two
pleasure
craft,
or
a
collision
between
a
pleasure
craft
and
a
commercial
vessel,
and
the
immediate
impact
upon
commerce
moving
through
the
waterway.
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
well,
let
me
suggest--
mr.
robert
j.
kopka
--let
me
suggest
this.
in
the
scenario
that
you
gave,
i
would
suggest
that
the
first
test
of
the
seventh
circuit
would
apply,
that
is,
whether
the
activity
involves
commercial
maritime
activity.
and
in
a
dock,
even
if
it
is
one
pleasure
boat
among
many
commercial
boats,
then
that
in
and
itself,
may
involve
commercial
maritime
activity.
so
that
we
are
talking
now
about
the
first
test
as
opposed
to
the
second
test.
you
are
correct
that
the
second
test,
in
my
suggestion,
would
not
apply.
however,
the
first
test,
that
a
commercial
maritime
activity
may
be
impacted,
would
permit
federal
admiralty
jurisdiction
in
that
scenario.
the
scenario
where
federal
admiralty
jurisdiction
would
not
be
permitted
is
where
the
dock
had
only
pleasure
craft
or
pleasure
craft
which
were
not
involved
in
maritime
commercial
activity
and
did
not
involve
navigation.
with
five
minutes
remaining,
i
would
like
to
address
the
other
issue,
which
is
the
question
of
whether
foremost...
pardon
me,
whether
richardson
v.
harmon
provides
a
separate
species
of
federal
admiralty
jurisdiction,
as
is
suggested
by
the
petitioner.
petitioner
would
have
this
court
read
foremost
to
apply
federal
admiralty
jurisdiction
even
when
the
tests
that
we
have
been
discussing,
the
situs
test
and
the
nexus
test,
are
absent.
and
there
is
no
basis,
either
in
the
law
or
in
the
constitution,
for
applying
federal
admiralty
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
the
limitation
of
liability
act.
there
is
nothing
in
the
limitation
of
liability
act
which
provides
a
separate
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction.
there
is
nothing
in
the
section
189,
the
amendment
to
the
limitation
of
liability
act,
which
provides
a
separate
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction.
and
richardson
v.
harmon,
to
the
extent
that
it
is
construed
to
provide
such
a
basis,
is
out
of
step
with
the
other
cases
of
this
court,
such
as
in
re
phenix
and
the
foremost
case.
and
since
the
advent
of
the
nexus
test
in
1973
and
again
in
1983,
that
test
should
be
applied
to
any
cause
of
action
under
the
limitation
of
liability
act,
notwithstanding
the
decision
in
richards
v.
harmon.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
pray
for
an
affirmance.
thank
you.
