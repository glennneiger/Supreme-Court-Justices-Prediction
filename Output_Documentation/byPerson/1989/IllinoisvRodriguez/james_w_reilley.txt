mr.
james
w.
reilley
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
chicago
police
made
the
physical
entry
without
a
search
warrant
into
mr.
rodriguez's
apartment--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--without
a
search
warrant.
without
a
search
warrant.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
not
to
arrest
him,
no.
but
they
could
not
have
gone
in
to
arrest
him.
they
could
have
knocked
on
the
door
and
if
he
answered
the
door,
they
could
have
arrested
him
at
the
door.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
the
hill
case--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--no,
they
did
not.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
that's
correct.
but
when
they
did
enter
the
apartment
without
a
search
warrant,
with
the
key...
and
we're
going
to
talk
about
the
consent...
that
did
trigger
the
fourth
amendment
and
it
obviously
calls
them
for
the
question
of
whether
the
search
ensuing
entry
was
reasonable
or
whether
it
feel
in
one
of
the
carefully
delineated
exceptions
to
the
warrant
or
arrest
warrant
requirement.
in
this
case,
the
government
chooses
to
argue
that
it
was
based
upon
consent,
which
would
require
voluntary
consent
by
a
person
having
common
authority
over
the
premises.
and
i
think
it's
obvious
in
this
case
that
the
common
authority
or
actual
authority
of
gail
fisher
did
not
exist.
consent
is
really
a
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right,
and
as
we
have
been
instructed
in
matlock,
the
normal
situation
of
a
consent
would
be
the
defendant
himself
consenting.
in
matlock,
it
would
be
a
third-party
consent,
which
is
what
we
have
here.
so
it
would
require
the
police
to
ask
more
questions
to
determine
if
the
third-party
consenting
has
actual
common
authority
over
the
premises
to
be
searched.
in
this
case,
the
consent
or
purported
consent
took
place
off
the
premises,
not
at
the
residence
where
the
ultimate
arrest
and
search
took
place.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
while
she
was
living
there?
mr.
james
w.
reilley
that
question,
of
course,
really
not
in
the
record
because
we
don't
know
when
she
moved
out.
well,
we
know
she
moved
out
on
july
1,
1985.
prior
to
that
if
she
had
been
living
there,
and
mr.
rodriguez
had
given
her
whatever
authority
it
was
he
gave
her,
then
perhaps
she
could
have
consented
in
a
limited
fashion.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
she
had
a
key
for
a
while
and
then
the
record
reflects,
i
believe
as
justice
scalia
stated,
that
she
did
indicate
she
stole
it
and
the
reason
she
stole
it
is
so
she
could
get
out
of
the
apartment
during
the
times
when
they
had
arguments.
apparently
he
would
lock
her
in
from
the
inside.
so
she
did
have
a
key,
but
the
key
alone...
the
key
without
common
actual
authority
is
no
different
than
a
sledgehammer.
if
she
has
a
key
but
has
no
authority
to
enter
the
premises
for
any
purpose
or
for
all
purposes,
it
might
as
well
have
been
a
sledgehammer
and
not
a
key.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
yes,
sir.
that's
correct.
the
key,
however,
would
dictate
along
with
the
scenario
of
what
happened
at
the
scene
of
the
confrontation
with
the
police
about
the
battery
that
more
questions
should
have
been
asked.
as
the
record
reflects--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--well,
i
think
what
your
honor...
you're
suggesting,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
if
she
lied
to
them...
because
we
now
know
that
the
facts
dictate
she
did
not...
if
she
lied
to
the
police
and
carefully
structured
her
lie
so
that
the
police
actually
thought
she
lived...
of
course,
her
answers
were
different
at
the
scene...
she
said
"i
used
to
live
there".
but
if
she
had
not
said
that
at
all
and
had
lied
completely,
i
think
that
would
be
the
one
rare
exception
that
doesn't
exist
and
that
i
don't
believe
would
happen
more
often
than
maybe
once
every
20
years.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
but
the
police
would
not--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--well,
if
the...
if
the
lies
took
place
at
her
mother's
house,
dorothy
jackson,
and
not
at
mr.
rodriguez's
house,
i
still
think
the
police
would
be
required
to
go
further
because
she's
not
there.
they
would
have
to
ask,
well,
why
are
you
here?
your
children
are
here.
why
are
your
children
here?
obviously
she
was
hostile
in
this
case,
as
opposed
to
matlock.
she
was
hostile.
she
had
been
beaten
up.
she
had
bruises
on
her
face.
and
i
think
the
hostility
of
that
confrontation
would
dictate
that
the
police
should
go
even
further.
in
matlock,
there
was
no
hostility.
it
was
on
the
premises.
the
girlfriend
of
mr.
matlock
came
to
the
door
in
a
bathrobe,
as
the
court
will
recall,
with
a
baby
in
her
hand
and
said,
i
live
upstairs
with
him
and
we
slept
there
last
night,
held
herself
out
as
his
wife
on
occasion.
there
is
not
question
that
was
in
fact
common,
actual
authority.
but
the...
the
lie
situation,
if...
again,
given
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
the
police
would
still
have
to
go
further
into
it
to
determine
whether
she
was
lying
or
whether
this
was
the
truth.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
yes,
that's
correct,
justice--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--that's
correct.
the
actual
authority.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
what
i'm
suggesting
is
the...
justice
o'connor--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--no.
i...
i
didn't
say
that.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
what
i'm
saying...
illinois
courts...
when
the
determination
was
made
later,
not
on
the
scene,
that
in
fact
that
was
a
lie,
the
illinois
courts
have
and
consistently
applied
the
doctrine
of
actual
authority.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
yes,
it
is,
and
always
has
been.
but
i...
i...
i
think
the
only
circumstance
where
one
could
at
least
suggest
that
they
understand
why
the
police
acted
the
way
they
did
is
if
someone
does
lie.
of
course,
that
is
not
the
case
before
us.
there
is
no
indication
she
lied.
and
i
would
like
to...
by
the
way,
justice
marshall
had
asked
the...
whether
the
language
was
in
the
transcript
that
she
stated
she
used
to
live
there.
i
filed
a
supplemental
record
with
this
court
which
was
allowed
and
which
was
the
preliminary
hearing
that
took
place
september
11,
1985,
about
two
months
after
the
incident.
in
that
transcript
officer
entress
states
when
asked
the
question,
"did
you
ask
her
where
she
lived.
"
he
stated...
quote...
"she
stated
she
used
to
live
there.
"
that's
in
the
supplemental
record,
page
16.
later
on,
a
year
later
at
the
suppression
hearing,
officer
entress
was
again
on
the
stand
and
stated
in
response
to
the
same
question,
"she
stated
to
me
she
had
been
living
there.
"
that's
on
the
joint
appendix,
page
10.
i
impeached
him
with
that
testimony
and
he
did
indicate
in
questioning
that,
yes,
he
did
say
that
a
year
before
when
his
memory
was
better
of
what
she
said.
i
think,
however,
that
both
of
those
statements
imply
that
she
didn't
live
there.
one
may
be
stronger
than
the
other,
and
i
suggest
that
the
first
one
is
the
correct
one.
but
in
any
event,
they
didn't
ask
further
questions
like
where
do
you
live
today.
they
never
did
do
that.
but
that
is
in
the
record.
again
i
would
like
to
go
to
the...
to
the
scene
of
what
occurred
when
dorothy
jackson
called
the
police.
dorothy
jackson,
of
course,
being
also
a
deputy
sheriff
as
we
learned.
the
police
arrived
at
about
2:30
in
the
afternoon
on
a
friday.
it's
not
a
court
holiday.
the
courts
are
open.
judges
are
available.
prosecutors
are
available.
and
upon
arrival,
officer
tenza,
who
did
not
testify
in
these
proceedings,
is
a
beat
officer
in
a
uniform
and
he
questions
dorothy
jackson
and
gail
fisher
for
a
few
moments
and
then
calls
a
tactical
team
as
a
backup.
tactical
officers,
among
other
chores,
are
drug
investigators.
they
come
to
the
scene
and
speak
to
her
and
i
think
this...
this
is
an
important
thing
to
note...
that
the
whole
conversation
between
officers
entress
and
gutierrez,
the
two
tactical
officers,
and
gail
fisher
and
her
mother
lasted
between
five
and
ten
minutes.
now,
if
we
are
going
to
talk
about
reasonable
police
behavior,
it
would
seem
that
if
the
conversation
only
lasted
five
to
ten
minutes
and
they
had
to
discuss
the
battery,
where
the
battery
took
place,
and
then,
as
the
court
will
note,
they
brought
up
the
question
of
drugs.
and
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
battery
arrest
was
not
the
reason
that
those
two
officers
came
there.
something
happened
in
the
conversation
with
dorothy
jackson,
the
mother,
and
gail
fisher.
we
know
that
now
because
dorothy
jackson
testified.
the
police
said,
"i
heard
about
rodriguez
before.
"
"isn't
he
involved
in
drugs?
"
and
then
entress
asked
gail
fisher,
"doesn't
he
have
drugs
in
the
house?
"
i
think
he
used
a
foul
word
and
she
didn't
want
to
repeat
that
word
but
she
used
the
word
drugs.
didn't
he
have
drugs
in
the
house?
officer
entress,
curiously
enough,
answers
that
gail
fisher
did
not
respond.
but
dorothy
jackson,
the
mother,
the
police
officer
mother,
says,
no,
my
daughter
said
yes
he
has
drugs
in
the
house,
and
i
concurred
and
suggested
that
there
were.
now,
i...
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
at
that
point
we
now
have
a
battery
situation,
but
now
it
has
arisen
to
officers'
appearance
that
there
may
be
drugs
here.
i
suggest
that
if
they
had
pursued...
at
this
point
they
still
don't
have
authority...
they're
more
concerned
about
that...
they're
not
questioning
any
further
with
regard...
during
that
five
to
ten
minutes.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
even
officer
entress
made
a
statement,
and
i--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--yes.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
this
argument,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
directed
at
the
fact
that
the
police
officers
did
not
do
the
necessary
work
they
should
have
done
in
a
nonexigent
circumstance
on
the
scene
to
obtain
valid
actual
authority
to
consent.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
yes.
so,
all
right.
if
the...
if
there...
if
they
concede,
which
they
obviously
do,
and
all
the
lower
courts
have
found
no
actual
authority
existed,
my
suggestion
is
that
the
circumstances
here
and
what
the
police
were
doing
do
not
even
give
rise
to
the
question
that
they
reasonably
believed
authority
existed,
because
they
weren't
concentrating
on
that.
they...
they
didn't
ask
the
right
questions.
it
would
have
been
in
a
situation
where
there
was
no
reason
to
rush,
it
was
three-and-a-half
hours
later
that
they
arrived
there.
the
record
reflects
this
beating
took
place
at
11:00
n
the
morning,
by
one
of
the
officers,
and
this
is
now
2:30.
so
there's
no...
there's
no
exigency,
there's
no
danger
of
flight.
in
fact,
she
said
rodriguez
is
asleep
in
the
apartment.
they
could
have
spent
another
five
or
ten
minutes
asking
the
right
questions.
and
then
they...
if
they
got
lies,
then,
of
course,
the
illinois
courts
would
not
approve
that,
but
they
could
have
found
out
probably
that
gail
fisher
would
have
said
no,
i
don't
live
there,
i
moved
out
three
weeks
ago.
and
if
they
had
inquired
of
that,
then
they
would
not
have
gone
in
with
any
type
of
consent
and
they
could
have
gone
and
done
what
they
should
have
done
and
that
is
to
either
arrest
him
at
the
door,
obtain
an
arrest
warrant,
or
if
they
pursued
the
line
of
questioning
regarding
the
drugs,
i
suggest
that
under
gates,
they
perhaps
could
have
applied
for
a
search
warrant
and
with
the
totality
test
of
gates
perhaps
would
have
gotten
it.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
i'm
sorry,
justice
white.
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
well,
according
to
the
record
she
testified
that
between
three
to
five
times
during
that
three-week
period,
she
had
gone
over
there
and
came
home
late
at
night
according
to
her
mother--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--yes.
yes.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
that
she
did
stay
there
sometimes.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
the
fact
that
she
was
beaten
up
would
indicate,
at
best,
that
she
was
there.
she
was
perhaps
a
visitor.
we
know
that
if
she
was
beaten
up
there
she
was
a
visitor
or
a
guest
or
an
invitee
but
not
necessarily
a
person
with
common
authority
for
general
purposes
to
search.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
they
were
still
friendly.
there's
no
question
about
that,
friendly
to
the
extent
that
he
beat
up
as
often
as
he
did.
but
she
was
there
and
she
came
home
and
i
recalled
she
said
to
her
mother,
"we
have
to
talk".
the
suggestion,
by
the
way,
in
one
of
the
briefs
for
the
government
that
she
was
hysterical
is
simply
not
supported
by
any
of
the
evidence
in
the
record
because
there's
no
evidence
of
it
at
all.
she
was
calmly
there
talking
to
her
mother,
who
called
the
police,
and
then
the
police
arrived.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
there's
no
question
in
our
minds
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
the...
the
crossing
of
the
threshold
of
that
door
without
any
authority
at
all
is
certainly
not
a
reasonable
reliance
authority
by
these
officers.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
well,
i
think
your
honor
is
asking
whether
or
not
the
exclusionary
rule
should
apply
in
this
circumstance.
i
would
suggest
that
the
cases
that
we
have
been
instructed
by
this
court
suggest
that
under
leon
or
under
maryland
v.
garrison
that
[inaudible]--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--it
should
apply
in
this
case.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
i
don't
what
other
ground
except
what
the
government--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--under
leon?
all
right.
the...
i
would
suggest
that
the
purpose
of
the
rule,
as
this
court
has
said,
is
to
deter
unlawful
police
conduct.
i
cannot
think
of
a
more
precise
case--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--for
this
is
the...
this
is
the
rule--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--the
government,
as
far
as
i
know,
has
never
raised
that
issue
whether
leon
applies.
the
lower
court...
in
the
trial
court,
as
i...
as
i
recollect
for
certain,
the
government
argued
that
there
was
actual
authority.
and
then,
we,
of
course,
argued
that
there
was
not
and
that
the
illinois
law
is
clear
on
that
point.
it
was
judge
schreier
in
his
comments
inviting
counsel
for
both
sides
to
discuss
whether
the
doctrine
of
apparent
authority,
using
that
word
loosely
perhaps--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--but
apparent
authority
applies
or
whether
there
should
be
some
exception
to
that.
he
ruled
that
there
was
not.
he
didn't
get
into
leon
or
any
exception.
the
appellate
court,
the
intermediate
court,
in
an
unpublished
opinion,
did
not
discuss
the
leon
exception.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
they
did
not.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
they
did
not.
it
was
not
mentioned,
and
the
court
cited--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--it
was
not.
the
appellate
court
cited
matlock
and
cited
perhaps
six
or
seven
illinois
state
court
cases
on
the
subject
of
actual
authority.
so
the
issue
of
leon
was
never
raised
at
any
level.
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
distinguish,
as
the
solicitor
talked
about,
maryland
v.
garrison.
as
this
court
is
aware,
garrison
involved
a
search
warrant,
where
the
police
had
done
an
extensive
investigation
prior
to
obtaining
the
search
warrant
to
determine
who
resided
on
the
third
floor
of
that
building.
they
went
to
the
building
itself
and
checked
the
description
of
the
building,
which
matched
the
informant's.
they
went
to
the
gas
and
electric
company
to
see
if
there
was
anyone
other
than
mcwebb,
the
proposed
defendant,
living
on
the
third
floor.
they
got
a
negative
answer.
they
checked
with
police
records
and
found
that
the
address
and
physical
description
matched
the
description
of
the
informant.
this
is
the
work
that
they
did.
when
the
warrant
was
executed,
of
course,
we
know
that
they
found
two
apartments
on
the
third
floor
and
then
made
a
mistake.
i
suggest
that
that's
relevant
here
because
the
officers
here
had
certainly
ample
time
to
not
only
ask
the
right
questions,
but
to
do
a
little
further
checking.
they
could
have...
they
could
have
checked
when
they
got
over
there
to
see
if...
who
was
on
the
doorbell.
they
could
have
asked
the
landlord,
perhaps,
who
was
on
the
lease.
i
mean...
or
make
a
phone
call
or
ask
the
right
questions.
they
had
the
opportunity
to
ask
the
mother,
who
moved
her
daughter
out
three
weeks
before...
and
her
children
out.
and
judge
schreier
found
that
to
be
very
convincing...
that
her
children
were
present
at
all
times...
in
fact
were
there
that
morning.
dorothy
jackson
had
to
have
a
friend
come
over
to
babysit
the
two
young
children
while
she
and
gail
fisher
were
told
by
the
police
to
go
back
to
mr.
rodriguez's
apartment.
if
she
wanted
to
press
charges
for
battery,
she
had
open
the
door
with
the
key.
she
was
misled
and
told
that.
that,
of
course,
was
not
true.
they
did
not
need
her
for
that
purpose.
if
they
wanted
to
arrest
him
for
battery,
which
they
certainly
could
have,
there
would
have
been
a
different
way
to
do
it
and
a
proper
way
to
do
it.
either
by,
under
hill,
knocking,
when
answers
to
arrest
him.
or
obtaining
an
arrest
warrant,
which
was
certainly
proper.
or
even
under
illinois
law,
they
could
have
sent
him
a
summons
in
the
mail
to
appear
in
court
for
at
that
time
a
misdemeanor.
and
i
note
that
no
felony
battery
charge
was
ever
filed
against
him.
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
in
payton
the
court
stated
that
the
magistrate's
determination
of
probably
cause
will
protect
the
citizen
from
the
zealous
officer.
i
suggest
these
were
zealous
officers
but
the
pretext
of
their
going
to
rodriguez's
apartment
was
to
look
for
drugs.
the
record
certainly
supports
that
assumption.
and
again,
i
suggest
that
if
they
wanted
to
that,
they
could
have
avoided
all
of
this
problem
we
have
now
with
this
case.
and
they
could
have
obtained,
or
at
least
attempted
to
obtain
a
search
warrant,
if
they
had
pursued
it
correctly.
and
i
am
certain
that
that
warrant
probably
would
have
been
upheld.
i
hypothetically
suggest
to
you
that
if
the...
gail
fisher
had
been
charged
with
possession
of
the
cocaine
in
this
house
and
the
marijuana,
and
she
moved
to
suppress
the
evidence,
that
the
government
would
be
standing
here
suggesting
to
you
that
she
didn't
have
standing
to
object
to
that
search
because
under
the
facts
as
we
know,
she
probably
did
not.
she
didn't
live
there.
she
had
a
key,
but
again,
the
key
without
authority
is
meaningless.
and
i
would
suggest
that
no
general
authority
for
common
purposes
that
she
probably
would
not
have
standing,
and
i
believe
standing
is
a
mirror
of
consent.
the
same
elements
would
apply,
in
my
judgment.
judge
schreier
specifically
found
that...
and
i
think
these
findings
are
important,
they
were
upheld
by
our
intermediate
appellate
court
and,
of
course,
the
illinois
supreme
court
refused
to
review
it...
that
gail
fisher
was
not
a
usual
resident,
let
alone
an
exclusive
resident;
that
she
was
rather
infrequent
a
visitor,
a
guest
or
an
invitee;
that
she
did
not
contribute
to
the
rent;
that
she
was
not
on
the
lease...
the
fact
of
her
having
the
key
was
not
a
substantial
piece
of
information
to
judge
schreier;
that
she
was
not
allowed
to
be
in
the
apartment
when
he
was
not
there;
that
she
was
like
a
guest
who
only
had
access
to
the
apartment
when
the
host
was
present.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
yes.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
well,
i
think
he
was...
obviously,
he
was
discussing
it
in
terms
of
illinois
law
and
he
so
stated.
that
is
for
sure.
but
i
think
the
factual
findings
are
things
that,
in
addition
to
his
feeling
about
illinois
law,
he's
also
indicating
what
the
police
officers
didn't
do,
what
they
didn't
learn
from
this.
they
could
have
found
out
some
of
these
things.
maybe
not
in
precise
a
detail
as
a
lawyer
or
a
judge
may
ask,
but
certainly,
the
collective
judgment
of
those
officers
had
to
be
at
least
20
to
25
years
of
experience.
and
if
we're
going
to
take
out
the
buffer
of
a...
in
leon,
of
a
judge
signing
a
warrant
or
the
buffer
in
krull
of
a
legislature
passing
an
ordinance,
then
we
certainly
must
adopt
some
standard
that
the
police
should
not
go
below
in
terms
of
asking
the
right
questions.
they
certainly
didn't
ask
any
questions
in
this
case,
which
would
bring
them
to...
even
be
able
to
argue
to
this
court
that
they
had
a
reasonable
belief
that
there
was
authority,
especially
in
view
of
the
red
flags
that
were
noted
to
them
at
the
scene.
the
hostility,
the
beating,
off
the
premises
where
she
allegedly
consented,
the
fact
that
she
said
"i
used
to
live
there",
her
children
being
present,
her
clothing
being
present.
all
those
red
flags
and
the
police
didn't
inquire.
i
can't
believe
they
could
stand
here
and
suggest
to
this
court
that
they
had
a
reasonable
belief
based
upon
reasonable
conduct.
their
conduct
was
not
reasonable.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
they
didn't
inquire
about
the
belongings
at
the
scene.
mr.
james
w.
reilley
no.
in
fact,
the--
mr.
james
w.
reilley
--it
came
out
at
the
hearing,
justice
white,
that
she
had
some
of
her
heavy
belongings...
her
stove,
her
refrigerator,
whatever...
where
left
there
either
on
loan
or
being
stored.
but
the
court
didn't
feel
in
its
findings
that
that
was
even
important.
judge
schreier
made
no
findings
concerning
that.
he
was
more,
i
think,
concerned
with
the
fact
that
she
moved
her
children
out
and
her
clothing.
i
would
suggest
that
the
doctrine
of
suppression
should
apply
here
because
the
officers'
conduct,
the
standard
that
the
state
suggests,
simply
would
not
apply
to
this
set
of
circumstances.
the
police
did
not
act
in
any
reasonable
good
faith
and
their
conduct
would
seem
to
be
a
direct
affront
to
the
fourth
amendment.
it
would
seem
that
suppression
here
would
be
direct
to
the
police,
would
be
a
direct
line
from
washington
to
the
police
departments,
who
certainly
are
educated
by
prosecutors.
they
have
seminars.
they
knew
about
consent
because
they
asked
for
it
in
this
case,
or
at
least
thought
they
were
asking
for
it.
so
they
must
have
know
about
the
schneckloth
case,
or
maybe
not
the
name,
but
they
knew
the
doctrine.
so
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
theories
of
this
court
get
down
to
the
police
on
the
street.
and
if
suppression
is
upheld
in
this
case,
they'll
learn
that
the
next
time
they
have
a
situation
like
this,
they
should
ask
the
right
questions
and
perhaps
later
on
some
other
rule
might
apply.
i
would
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
uphold
the
decision
of
the
illinois
appellate
court.
