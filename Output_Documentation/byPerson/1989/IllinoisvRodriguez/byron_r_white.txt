well,
is
it
just
a
leon
sort
of
approach?
justice
byron
r.
white
good
faith
belief?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
leon
ever
relied
on
at
all
by
the
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
she
had
just
been
beaten
up
the
night
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
that
very
day
in
that
apartment.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
some
suggestion
that
they
didn't
have
probable
cause
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
mean
if
they
didn't
have
probable
cause,
they
had
no
business
going
in
the
house
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
they
went
there...
they
went
there
to
arrest
the
man.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
thought
they
had
probable
cause,
and
i
guess
they
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
a
warrant
in
order
to
make
the
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
search
warrant
to
go
in
and
arrest
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
they--
justice
byron
r.
white
--they
didn't
need
a
search
warrant
to
go
in...
go
in
the
apartment
to
arrest
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
why
they
went
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the...
do
you
think
that
the
lady's
consent
would
have
been
adequate
while
she
was
living
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-huh.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
she
did
have
the
key...
she
did
have
the
key
for
a
while
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
doing
there
that
day?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
she
has
moved
out,
what
was
she
doing
over
there
that
day?
i
suppose
that's...
that
is
a
fact
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
she
testified
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
--wasn't
that...
just
the
fact
that
she
had
been
beaten
up
in
that
apartment
that
day,
wasn't
that
something,
a
fact
that
the
officers
were
entitled
to
consider
about
her
in...
in
terms
of
her
authority?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it's
just
a
fact.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we're
going...
i...
i
take
it
this
discussion
goes
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
it
was...
suppose
we
agree
with
you
that
it
was,
does
that
determine
the
admissibility?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
does
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
that
issue
still
open?
let's
suppose
we
agree
with
you
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
is
the
case
over
or
is
admissibility
still
to
be
considered
on
some
other
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
leon.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
my--
justice
byron
r.
white
--that
isn't
my
question,
whether
leon
should
apply.
but
is
the...
is
the
issue
of
whether
leon
applies
still
open?
has
that
ever
been
determined
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
state
argue
leon--
justice
byron
r.
white
--in
the
appellate
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
argued
in
the
trial
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
police
know
at
the
site
or
at
the
scene
that
some
of
her
belongings
were
still
in
the
apartment?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
they
know
it?
did
she
ever
suggest
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
this...
this
just
came
out
at
the
suppression
hearing?
