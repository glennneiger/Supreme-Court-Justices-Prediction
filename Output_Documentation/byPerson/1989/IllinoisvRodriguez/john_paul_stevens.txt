justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
that
in
the
trial
court,
but
how
about
the
appellate
court?
did
they
rely
on
leon
in
the
appellate
court
and
argue
for
an
exception
from
the
exclusionary
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
also
in
your
questions
presented
you
just
make
a
fourth
amendment
argument.
you
don't
make
a
good
faith
exclusion
from...
from
the
exclusionary
rule--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
your
questions
presented.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
a
valid
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which,
as
you
pointed
out
with
justice
scalia,
is
a
very
different
question
from
whether
it's
a
leon-type
exception
from
the
exclusionary
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
know.
in
your
brief
you
argued
something--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
didn't
preserve
in
the
cert.
petition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
what
extent
in
your
view
do
the
police
have
a
duty
of
inquiry
in
order
to
support
the
reasonableness
of
their
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
this
case,
do
you
think
the
police
officer
had
any
duty
to
ask
the
young
lady
if
she
lived
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
do
you
think
they
had
any
duty
to
ask
her
if
she
lived
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wonder
if
that's
right,
mr.
reilley,
as
a
matter
of
illinois
law.
wasn't
the
rule
in
the
shambley
case
in
those
subsequent
cases
that
they
always
inquired
into
the
actual
authority...
the
person...
usually
those
are
husband
and
wife
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
are
a
lot
of
times
where
the
wife
gave
consent
and
they
always
asked
whether
she
had
authority
to
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
i'm...
i'm
just
wondering
whether
you're
correct
in
saying
that
the
illinois
courts
in
these
cases
would
have...
would
have
allowed
the
entry
based
on
falsehoods
told
by
the
wife
or
the...
or
the
woman
who
lived
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they've
always
said
actual
authority
is
the
rule
in
illinois.
