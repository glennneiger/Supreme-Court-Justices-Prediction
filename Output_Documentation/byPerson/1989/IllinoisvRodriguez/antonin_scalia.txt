it
has
to
be
more
than
an
objective
test
of
what
they
knew
at
the
time.
i
mean,
suppose
they...
they
meet
somebody
walking
along
the
street
who
says,
you
know,
i'd...
i'd
like...
i
give
you
permission
to
go
into
my
house
over
there...
and
that's
all
he
tells
him...
my
house
over
there.
on
the
basis
of
all
that
they
objectively
know,
that's
his
house.
i
mean,
they
have
no
reason
to
think
it's
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
enough
to
let
them
go
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
just
what
they
know.
it's...
it's...
they
do
have
some
positive
obligation
to
make
inquiry,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we...
we
have
two
different
questions
here,
i
suppose.
apparent
authority,
if
we
adopt
that,
means
that
there
has
been
no
fourth
amendment
violation
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
other
doctrine
of
good
faith
would
mean
that
there
has
been
but
the
evidence
just
won't
be
excluded.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
might
not
we
want
to
have
a
much
higher
standard
for
the
one
than
for
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
say
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
there
is
no
fourth
amendment
violation
at
all.
why
shouldn't
we
say
it's
up
to
the
police
to
make
substantial
inquiry
in
order
to...
to
justifiably
go
into
an
apartment?
but
even
if
they
don't
make
that
much
inquiry,
if
they
were
operating
in
good
faith
and
they
do
go
in
wrongfully,
we
might
let
the
evidence
come
in
in
a
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
i
feel
much
different
about
your
apparent
authority
argument
than
i
do
about
your
good
faith
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
there
is
real
apparent
authority?
are
you
talking
real
apparent
authority
as
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--commonly
understood
in
the
common
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
for
ordinary
apparent
authority
you'd
need
more
than
that.
nobody
has
apparent
authority
to
act
with
respect
to
my
property
unless
i
have
given
that
person
the
apparent
authority.
now,
in
this
case
if
the
defendant
had
given
his
key
to
the
woman,
then
i
might...
i
might
agree
with
you
that
he
had
clothed
her
with
apparent
authority.
but
she
stole
the
key.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
shouldn't
be...
be
tagged
with...
with
somebody
acting
on
my
behalf
or
with
apparent
authority
unless
i
have...
it's
my
fault
for
giving
that
person
apparent
authority.
now,
where
was...
where
was
the
fault
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
well.
i
thought
her
last
story
was
that
she
took
it
off
the
dresser.
it
was
his
key
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i'll
take
the
last
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
what
other
cases
do
we
have
where...
where
reasonableness
of...
of...
of
proceeding
without
a
warrant
or
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
and
seizure
is
determined
not
on
the
basis
of
objective
fact
reasonableness
but
just
on
the
basis
of
mental
impression
reasonableness?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
position
you're
taking
is
that
they
could
have
gone
in
there
without
probable
cause.
they
could
have
gone
in
there
just
because
they
wanted
to
look
around
the
apartment.
justice
antonin
scalia
since
she...
since
she
let
them
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
on
these
facts,
if
they...
even
if...
even
if
there
hadn't
been
the
beating...
the
beating
is
really
quite
irrelevant,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so
without
the
beating,
if
they
just
wanted
to
snoop
around
the
apartment,
so
long
as
what
happened
here
happened,
they
would
have
been
able
to
go
in
and
look
all
around.
