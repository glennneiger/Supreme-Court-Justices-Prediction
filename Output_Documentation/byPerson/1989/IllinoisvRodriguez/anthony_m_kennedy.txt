anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
still
not
clear
to
me.
are...
are
you
relying
on
apparent
authority
as
we
use
it
in
agency
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
it's
apparent...
it's
an
apparent
authority
doctrine
for
fourth
amendment
search
purposes
that
is
quite
divorced
from
agency
law
purposes,
i
take
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
certainly
different
from
the
standpoint
of
the
objective
appearances
to
the
officer.
