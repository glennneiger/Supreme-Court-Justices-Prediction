mr.
joseph
claps
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
brought
before
this
court
on
the
state
of
illinois'
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
illinois
appellate
court,
first
judicial
district,
third
division.
this
matter
involves
the
consensual
entry
into
an
apartment
by
the
chicago
police
to
effectuate
the
immediate
arrest
of
edward
rodriguez
for
a
brutal,
aggravated
battery.
in
the
course
of
the
arrest
controlled
substances
were
found
which
were
later
suppressed
by
the
trial
court.
illinois
asks
this
court
to
find
that
the
court
below
committed
error
when
it
affirmed
the
trial
court's
suppression
of
evidence
by
failing
to
recognize
that
a
police
officer's
reasonable
reliance
on
a
third
party's
apparent
authority
to
allow
consensual
entry
is
a
valid
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement.
in
this
case,
the
police
arrived
at
3554
south
wolcott
in
chicago,
which
was
the
home
of
dorothy
johnson,
the
stepmother
of
gail
fisher.
the
police
found
at
that
location
the
victim
of
a
brutal,
aggravated
battery.
they
saw
her
jaw
swollen,
her
jaw
distorted,
black
eye
and
bruises
on
her
neck.
they
learned
from
this
victim
that
the
assailant
in
this
matter,
ed
rodriguez,
was
at
an
apartment
that
she
described
as
"our
apartment".
she
further
told
the
police
that
this
aggravated
battery
had
occurred
that
day
in
that
apartment
that
she
described
as
"our".
she
went
on
to
tell
the
police
that
she
would
sign
complaints
for
aggravated
battery
and
allow
the
officers
to
enter
that
apartment
to
effectuate
the
arrest
of
ed
rodriguez.
she
indicated
to
the
police
officers
that
she
would
allow
them
to
enter
through
the
use
of
a
key
that
she
described
as
"my
key".
she
also
told
the
officers
that
items
of
her
personal
ownership...
furniture,
stove,
a
refrigerator
and
other
personal
property...
was
still
present
in
that
apartment.
mr.
joseph
claps
that
specific
problem...
that
specific
question
was
not
directly
asked.
i
believe
in
the
record
that's
before
you
the
police
officer
indicated
that
based,
on
what
he
asked
her
and
her
statements
in
describing
the
apartment
as
"our"
and
"their",
that
it
was
his
belief
that
she
was
still
living
there.
that,
coupled
with
the
fact
that
the
victim
told
the
police
officer--
mr.
joseph
claps
--he
didn't
ask
that
specific
question.
mr.
joseph
claps
he
had
said
that...
he
described
what
she
said
as
using
the
words
she
"had
been
living
there".
mr.
joseph
claps
we
believe
that
the
test
should
be
an
objective
test
of
what
the
police
officers
knew
and
should
have
known
in
light
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
at
the
time.
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
joseph
claps
--they
have...
they
cannot
proceed
on
the
fact
that
ignorance
is
bliss.
i
think
that's
primarily
the
ruling
in
stoner
v.
california.
you
can't
ignore
the
fact
that
a
person
who
is
a
motel
clerk
does
not
have
the
ability
to
gain...
to
give
entry
into
an
apartment.
but
in
this
case,
i
don't
believe
we
have
ignorance
is
bliss.
in
this
case
the
victim,
whose
jaw
we
later
found
was
broken,
certainly
was
distorted
and
extended,
the
victim
of
a
brutal,
aggravated
battery,
indicated
to
the
police
that
this
had
just
occurred
in
an
apartment
that
she
described
as
"our
apartment".
and
so
it
was
reasonable
under
the
information
given
to
the
police,
including
the
fact
that
most
of
her
belongings
were
still
in
that
apartment,
that
we
don't
have
in
this
case
a
situation
where
ignorance
is
bliss.
it
is
certainly
has
to
be
a
test...
an
objective
test
of
what
the
police
knew
at
the
time.
so--
mr.
joseph
claps
--well--
mr.
joseph
claps
--in
that
particular
fact...
situation,
justice,
i
would
say
no.
and
what
i'm
talking
about--
mr.
joseph
claps
--yes,
they
do.
the
apparent
authority
doctrine,
which,
by
the
way,
is
utilized
by
the
majority
of
courts,
state
and
federal,
that
have
reviewed
it...
it's...
it's
clearly
a
test
that's
been
working
in
other
parts
of
the
county.
illinois
is
in
the
minority
in
terms
of
rejecting
the
apparent
authority.
but
it's...
it's...
in
terms
of
your
question,
if
i...
if
i
was
standing
in
a
doorway
of
an
apartment
and
i
told
you...
the
police...
that
this
was
my
apartment,
showed
them
a
lease,
showed
them
identification,
all
which
turned
out
to
be
false,
that
certainly
shouldn't
be
held
against
the
police.
they
have...
you
have
to
review
in
terms
of
what
they
knew
or
should
have
known
in
light
of
the
facts
and
circumstances.
mr.
joseph
claps
that's
true.
mr.
joseph
claps
that's
true.
mr.
joseph
claps
how
much
higher
standard
for
the--
mr.
joseph
claps
--for
the
intrusion?
mr.
joseph
claps
it
would
necessarily--
mr.
joseph
claps
--i...
i
understand.
the...
the...
when
i
say
the
objective
test
in
terms
of
reasonableness
in
light
of
all
the
facts
and
circumstances,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
police
could
carelessly
accept
someone
walking
down
the
street
who
says,
that's
my
car
or
that's
my
apartment,
go
ahead
and
search
it.
it
has
to
be
reviewed
in
light
of
practical
terms.
mr.
joseph
claps
no,
what
i'm
talking
about--
mr.
joseph
claps
--no,
what
i
am
talking
about...
it
should
not
be
a
test...
the
police
officer
shouldn't
involve
in
guessing
games.
we
shouldn't
evaluate
what
they
do
with
the
time
in
light
of
complicated
marital
or
property
rights.
it's
not
that.
but
it's
a
test
that
this
court
has
used
in
all
warrantless
searches.
what
did
the
police
know
at
the
time
to
base
their
decision
on?
and
where
in
this
case
you
have
the
victim
of
an
aggravated
battery
who...
the
aggravated
battery
occurred
at
this
apartment
and
she
has
a
key,
and
she
has
told
the
police
that
that's
where
she
lives--
mr.
joseph
claps
--but
i--
mr.
joseph
claps
--well,
i
don't
think
that
the
record's
clear
as
to
how
she
obtained
the
key,
and
i
think
the
record
shows
that
even
the
trial
court
was
not...
did
not
make
a
finding
as
to
when
and
how
she
obtained
the
key
because
there
was
a...
even
a
change
in
testimony
by
gail
fisher
as
to
how
she
obtained
the
fee...
the
key.
mr.
joseph
claps
that
was...
that
was
her
last
story.
mr.
joseph
claps
well,
we
don't
always
take
the
last
one.
but--
mr.
joseph
claps
--justice,
there
was
some
testimony...
the
first
testimony
by
the
police
officer
where
he
characterized
it
as
"used".
but
when...
during
the
suppression
hearing,
the
police
officer
said
that
she...
her...
his
recollection
was
that
she
"had
been
living
there"
and
it
was
his,
belief
based
on
what
she
told
him,
that
she
was
residing--
mr.
joseph
claps
--at
that
residence.
mr.
joseph
claps
i
wouldn't
suggest
there
were
two
different
stories.
i
think
it
was
a
characterization
that
the
police
officer
used.
mr.
joseph
claps
the
rule
should
be
that...
that
the
police
believed
at
the
time
that
they
made
the
intrusion
that
that
person
had
authority.
yes.
mr.
joseph
claps
but...
and
the
policeman--
mr.
joseph
claps
--is
going
to
testify
and
the
person
who
gave
the
consent.
mr.
joseph
claps
he
said
that--
mr.
joseph
claps
--she
had
been
living
there,
which
was,
by
the
way,
corroborated
by
the
stepmother
in
this
case,
dorothy
johnson.
she
also
testified
that
she
believed
that
her
stepdaughter
was
living
at
that
apartment,
not
with
her.
mr.
joseph
claps
gail
fisher
or
dorothy
johnson?
mr.
joseph
claps
gail
fisher
or
dorothy
johnson?
mr.
joseph
claps
dorothy
johnson,
the
stepmother.
i
don't
think
it
is
apparent
that
she
said
whatever
the
police
wanted.
she
was
the
stepmother
of
the
victim.
that's
the
information
that
she
said
she
heard--
mr.
joseph
claps
--she
has
some
interest.
it
was
her
stepdaughter.
mr.
joseph
claps
so
did
gail
fisher
who,
depending
on
what
point
in
time
we're
talking
about,
was
either
living
with
him
or
not.
mr.
joseph
claps
well,
it's
our
position
that,
again,
that
was
a
characterization
and
it
wasn't
a
past
tense;
it
was
a
present
tense.
mr.
joseph
claps
i'm
not
sure
that
the
record's
clear
that
that's
what
she
said.
mr.
joseph
claps
the
police
officer's
testimony
was
that
she
had
been
living
there.
mr.
joseph
claps
yes.
mr.
joseph
claps
it
may
not
be.
mr.
joseph
claps
it...
it
does
not.
mr.
joseph
claps
it
shows
u-s-e-d.
that's
the
word
that's
printed
in
the
transcript.
she
used--
mr.
joseph
claps
--it
might,
but
when
the
police
officer...
that
was
the
testimony
at
the
preliminary
hearing
and
the
motion
to
suppress.
when
confronted
with
that
different
language,
the
police
officer
said
that
it
was
his
recollection
that
she
said
she
had
been
living
there.
she
didn't
use
the
word
"used".
it
was
his
word.
mr.
joseph
claps
ordinarily.
yes.
mr.
joseph
claps
no,
i
can't.
no.
it
would
be
past.
the
fact
that
consents
are
well
established
has
been
the
ruling
of
this
court
since
the
case
in
schneckloth
v.
bustamonte.
what
the
illinois
courts
fail
to
accept
in
apparent
authority
is
the
exact
issue
that
was
left
open
by
this
court
in
the
matlock
case.
what
the
police
need
to
be
able
to
use
when
deciding
an
issue
on
consent
is
some
practical
use
that
they
can
have
to
make
a
decision.
the
police
have
a
right
to
know
whether
their
conduct
is
going
to
violate
the
constitution
or
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
claps
no.
it's
a...
it's
an
objective
test,
a
reasonableness
standard
based
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
and
the
reasons
why
the
police
acted
the
way
they
did,
the
same
type
of
test
that's
utilized
in
all
warrantless
search
situations
by
the--
mr.
joseph
claps
--yes.
mr.
joseph
claps
well,
you
begin
with--
mr.
joseph
claps
--you
begin
with
the...
the
cases
that
this
court
has
found
in
hill
v.
california
and
maryland
v.
garrison.
a
mistake
of
fact
should
not
be
held
against
the
police
in
terms
of
a
fourth
amendment
violation
when
it's
done
in
good
faith.
in
terms
of
the
exclusionary
rule
being
invoked
in
this
case,
then
we're
talking
about
leon
and
illinois
v.--
mr.
joseph
claps
--yes.
it
was.
and
in
fact
in
the
trial
court,
the
state
did
argue
that,
notwithstanding
everything
else,
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
be
invoked
in
this
case
because
there
is
no
police
misconduct
to
deter.
mr.
joseph
claps
well,
but
the...
the--
mr.
joseph
claps
--the
appellate
court
opinion
was
not
published
but
they
relied
on
the
trial
court.
the
appellate
court
said
the
trial
court
was
right
in
rejecting
apparent
authority
based
on
matlock.
mr.
joseph
claps
well,
we
state--
mr.
joseph
claps
--we
state
in
our
question
that
the
good
faith
actions
of
the
police
officers
to
accept
apparent
authority--
mr.
joseph
claps
--the
warrant
requirement.
mr.
joseph
claps
that's
right.
mr.
joseph
claps
in
the
cert.
petition.
but
in
our
brief--
mr.
joseph
claps
--yes.
mr.
joseph
claps
in
the
cert.
petition.
that's
correct.
i
would
like
to
remain...
keep
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
joseph
claps
yes,
justice...
chief
justice.
mr.
joseph
claps
i
want
to
first
say
that
the
statement
by
counsel,
although
i'm
sure
it
wasn't
on
purpose,
is
not
correct
about
what
was
argued
before
the
trial
judge
in
the
suppression
hearing.
and
although
it's
not
in
the
joint
appendix,
i
believe
it
is
in
the
record
that
the
court
has
on
page
137,
the
assistant
state's
attorney,
gibbons,
in
arguing
to
the
judge
said,
"in
that
case,
judge,
the
reason
for
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
in
such
instances
of
good
faith
relied
upon
the
police...
relied
upon
by
the
police,
it
would
do
little
in
terms
of
deterring
this
conduct
and
future
protections
afforded
by
the
fourth
amendment.
"
and
he
goes
on
to
cite
united
states
v.
leon
and
massachusetts
v.
sheppard.
so
the
exclusionary
concept
was
argued
before
the
trial
judge
and
it
was
in
our
appellate
brief...
not
leon,
but
we
cited
united
states
v.
calandra
and
stated
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
not
be
served
by
the
suppression
of
evidence.
so
we
did
make
that
argument
in
the
appellate
court
and
the
trial
court.
and
although
we
didn't
put
it
directly
in
the
question
for
review
in
the
cert.
petition,
we
did
in
the
body
of
the
cert.
petition
cite
leon
and
argue
that
its
the...
invoke
the
exclusionary
rule
would
not...
would
not
be
a
purpose
here
to
deter
any
police
misconduct.
and
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
it
would
deter
police
misconduct,
i
think
is
not
true.
where
they
reasonably,
under
the
circumstances...
an
objective
test
in
a
balancing...
where
they
act
based
on
the
information
before
them,
the
fourth
amendment
should
not
be
invoked.
it's
not
true
that
the
police
officers
were
not
aware
that
she
had
property
there.
in
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
entress,
he
said
she
told
him
that
her
items
of
personnel...
personal
property
were
still
there.
and
in
terms
of
what
counsel
argues
to
you
about
the
reverse
of
this
case...
that
is,
a
privacy
interest
by
gail
fisher.
she
would
have
a
privacy
interest.
you
don't
have
just
have
one
place,
one
premise,
one
piece
of
property
that
you
an
invoke
a
privacy
interest
in
and
therefore
seek
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment.
it
is
very
possible
that...
in
fact,
i
believe
it's
true
that
gail
fisher
would
have
had
a
privacy
interest
in
that
apartment
on
california
avenue
to
have
sought
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment,
just
as
she
would
perhaps
in
the
apartment
that
she
was
staying
in.
she
was...
there
was
testimony
she
at
that
apartment
every
day.
she
stayed
there
a
few
nights,
but
she
was
there
every
single
day.
if
there
was
anybody
that
was
excluded
from
that
apartment
during
the
time
period,
it
was
her
children,
not
her.
so
her
privacy
interest
was
still
there,
and
if
she
had
a
privacy
interest
there,
then
certainly
under
the
cases
that
this
court
have
found,
she
would
have
the
ability
to
give
consent
or
at
least,
in
terms
of
the
police
conduct,
for
them
to
rely
on
her
permission,
her
consent
to
allow
the
entry
for
the
arrest.
this
isn't
a
case
about
drugs.
this
is
a
case
about
the
police
acting
immediately
to
arrest
a
person
who
committed
a
brutal,
aggravated
battery,
and
what
was
found
incident
to
that
lawful
entry
should
not
be
suppressed.
