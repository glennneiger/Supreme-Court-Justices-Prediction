chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-2018,
illinois
v.
edward
rodriguez.
mr.
claps.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ordinarily
i...
it's
hard
to
imagine
someone
saying
"i
use
to
live
there".
it's
very
easy
to
imagine
them
saying
"i
used
to
live
there".
what...
what
does
the...
does
the
transcript
show
one
thing
or
the
other
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
it
show
the
word
u-s-e
somewhere?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that...
isn't
that
the
natural
way
to
read
that
expression?
i
used
to,
meaning
i
did
but
i
don't
anymore?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
so,
he
may
have
a
different
recollection
at
some
other
time.
but
ordinarily,
if...
if
one
actually
says
i
used
to
it
means
something
happened
in
the
past.
you
would
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
fact,
not
just...
can
you
think
of
any
exception
to
the
proposition
that
when
you
say
"i
used
to",
it
in
means
in
the
past?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
claps.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
reilley.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
reilley--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
this
part
of
your
argument
devoted
to
the
proposition
that,
assuming
that
apparent
authority
or
reasonable
belief
objectively
is
enough,
that
wasn't
present
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
the...
the
petitioner
is
really
contending
that
there
was
actually
authority
to
consent.
i
mean,
the
proposition
they
raise
in
their
petition
for
certiorari
is
good
faith
reliance
on
a
third-party's
apparent
authority.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
judge
schreier
was
discussing
the
thing
in
terms
of
actual
authority,
wasn't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
that's
all
illinois
law
allowed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
if...
if
we
were
to
find
that
this
apparent
authority...
or
hill,
garrison,
that
sort
of
thing
that
you
have
been
discussing...
maybe
these
facts
would
have
different
significance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
reilley.
mr.
claps,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
claps.
the
case
is
submitted.
