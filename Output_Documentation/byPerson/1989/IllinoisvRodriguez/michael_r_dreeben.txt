mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
search
that
is
supported
by
the
reasonable
appearance
of
consent
based
on
objective
facts
is
a
reasonable
search
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
that
rule
follows
from
this
court's
decisions
in
hill
v.
california
and
maryland
v.
garrison
which,
accept
the
proposition
that
reasonable
mistakes
of
fact
in
the
course
of
making
arrests
and
executing
warrants
do
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
and
the
rule
serves
and
is
supported
by
two
principle
considerations.
first,
requiring
the
police
to
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
consent
is
present,
based
on
objective
facts,
cabins
the
actions
of
police
officers
so
that
arbitrary
actions
and
intrusions
of
rights
will
not
occur.
the
police
must
have
a
reasonable
basis
based
on
objective
facts
in
order
to
satisfy
this
rule.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
stevens,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
police
should
have
a
mandatory
duty
of
inquiry
in
each
case.
each
case
should
be
judged
on
it's
particular
facts,
based
on
the
facts
that
are
available
to
the
police
when
they
make
their
decision.
in
an
ambiguous
situation
where
no
reasonable
police
officer
could
assume
that
consent
is
present
without
asking
further
clarifying
questions,
then
i
think
there
would
be
a
duty
for
the
police
officers
to
clarify
the
situation
by
asking
some
appropriate
questions.
this
shouldn't
entail,
however,
a
requirement
that
the
police
trace
down
drivers'
licenses,
look
up
real
estate
records
and
otherwise
engage
in
elaborate
investigation
that
would
essentially
thwart
the
police's
reliance
on
consents.
these
kinds
of
consent
searches
develop
on
a
day-to-day
basis
with
frequency
when
the
police
are
out
on
a
beat
and
are
dealing
with
situations
that
are
presented
to
them.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
the
police
officers
acted
quite
reasonably.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
i
don't
think
that
they
did,
justice
stevens.
and
the
reason
that
they
didn't
have
a
specific
duty
to
ask
that
particular
question
is
that
they
were
summoned
to
the
scene
of
what
they
understood
was
a
battery
victim.
they
spoke
with
a
woman.
they
learned
that
she
had
been
beaten
by
her
boyfriend
at
an
apartment
that
they...
she
described
as
"our
apartment".
there's
testimony
that
she
said
that
many
of
her
things
were
there.
it's
not
clear
in
connection
with
what
question
she
made
that
response.
but
she
said
that
she
had
a
key
to
the
apartment,
and
she
would
let
the
police
officers
in.
this
must
be
a
situation
that
police
officers
around
the
country
face
hundreds
of
times
every
day.
it's
unfortunate,
but
it
is
true
that
there
are
many
domestic
situations
like
this
in
which
a
battered
spouse
or
a
battered
companion
seeks
the
help
of
the
police
and
seeks
the
police
to
place
the
perpetrator
under
arrest.
and
the
police
in
this
case
were
presented
with
that
kind
of
a
model,
that
kind
of
a
framework.
i
think
it--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
it
would
be
fully
appropriate
for
this
court
to
hold
that
appropriate
inquiry
is
necessary
when
the
facts
are
ambiguous
and
clarification
is
what
a
reasonable
police
officer
would
do.
to
establish
a
prophylactic
rule,
a
miranda-type
rule,
that
the
police
officers
must
ask
this
list
of
questions
or
the
search,
based
on
consent,
is
invalid,
i
don't
think
is
necessary
to
protect
fourth
amendment
rights
and
i
don't
think
it
would
be
an
appropriate
implementation
of
the
fourth
amendment
in
this
context.
in
schneckloth
v.
bustamonte
this
court
avoided
a
warning
requirement
which
would
have
insisted
that
the
police
inform
people
that
they
have
the
right
to
decline
to
consent
to
a
search.
and
the
major
rationale
of
refusing
to
apply
that
kind
of
a
warning
requirement
is
that
it
would
essentially
frustrate
the
validity
of
the
police
being
able
to
act
on
consents.
these
just
aren't
the
type
of
searches
that...
that
come
about
in
a
structure
kind
of
environment,
where
a
police
officer
will
routinely
think
of
pulling
out
a
card
and
reading
a
list
of
questions.
but
that's
not
to
suggest
that
in
an
appropriate
case,
questions
wouldn't
be
appropriate.
it
is
not,
for
example,
our
position
that
a
neighbor
who
has
a
key
to
let
in...
you
know,
to
water
the
plants
while
someone
is
away
could
call
the
police
up
and
consent
to
a
search
and
the
police
would
have
absolutely
no
duty
or
responsibility--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--to
find
out
a
little
bit.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
marshall,
i
don't
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
i
think
in
that
situation,
justice
marshall,
it
probably
would
be
appropriate.
the
only
federal
case--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
this
is
not
the
same
case
because
there
is
a
context
involved
here.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
this
case
the
victim
of
the
battery
described
the
apartment
as
being
her
apartment
and
she
produced
a
key.
she
brought
the
police
officers
to
the
apartment
and
she
let
them
in.
this
would
have
readily
fit
in
with
a
reasonable
understanding--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
there...
there's...
i
would
like
to
clarify
the
record
for--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
this
case
i
do
not
think
it
was
required
for
the
police
to
ask,
but
i
think
that
is
a
question
that
the
illinois
courts--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
not
if
they
don't
have
a
reasonable
basis
for
doing
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
question
that
arose
as
to
whether
the
transcript
reflects
that
the
police
testified
that
she
used
to
live
there--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
testimony
reflects
that
the
police
understood
her
to
say
that
she
had
been
living
there
and
she
had
a
key
and
she
would
let
them
in.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
illinois
courts
did
not
reach
that
finding.
and
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
the
question
is
whether
a
reasonable
belief
by
the
police
officers
would
have
justified
the
entry,
not
whether
in
fact
on
the
facts
of
this
case--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--she
had
been
beaten
up
that
very
day.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
that's
correct.
we--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
would
suggest
that
this
is
based
on
objective
fact.
it's
based
on
all
the
facts
that
are
known
to
the
officers
or
that
they
should
have
known.
but
i
believe
that
it's
quite
clear
that
in
an
exigent
circumstances
case,
for
example,
the
test
is
whether
the
police
have
reason
to
believe
that
going
into
a
house
is
needed
to
preserve
safety
or
to
preserve
evidence.
if
in
fact
it
turned
out
that
they
heard
screams
inside
the
house
and
it
was
coming
from
a
television
set,
i
don't
think
that
that
would
invalidate
an
entry
that
was
otherwise
properly
based
on
probable
cause
and
exigent
circumstances.
again,
in
maryland
v.
garrison,
this
court
asked
the
question
whether
a
warrant
that
permitted
entry
into
one
house
but
not
another,
but
was
inadvertently
executed
by
entering
the
second
house,
was
a
valid
entry
and
the
court
held
that
it
was
a
valid
entry
because
in
the
process
of
executing
a
warrant
the
officers
will
make
reasonable
mistakes
and,
provided
that
the
mistake
that
they
make
is
reasonable,
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
offended.
we
think
that
that
is
a
preferable
rule
to
holding
that
some
sort
of
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
would
be
extended
and
should
cover
this
case.
the
major
reason
is
that
police
officers
do
want
to
and
do
try
to
comply
with
the
fourth
amendment
as
they
are
instructed
it
applies
to
them.
if
this
court
should
hold
that
the
reasonable
appearance
of
authority
is
not
sufficient,
responsible
police
officers
and
their
supervisors
will
be
forced
to
instruct
their
officers:
no
matter
how
reasonable
it
appears
to
you
on
the
street
to
accept
a
consent
and
go
in
and
take
care
of
enforcing
the
criminal
laws
as
you
see
them,
you
should
hesitate
and
perhaps
you
should
come
back
and
discuss
with
us,
perhaps
you
should
go
through
and
wait
to
see
whether
probable
cause
develops
and
whether
you
can
get
a
warrant.
and
that
would
be
quite
a
substantial
disruption
of
law
enforcement--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
think,
justice
white,
in
this
case
they--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
think,
justice
white,
an
entry
based
on
consent
of
someone
who
has
authority
to
do
it
or--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
i
believe
that
they
had
properly
a
probable
cause
to
arrest
him
and
they
believe
that
they
had
the
authority
to
enter
the
house,
because
the
person
who--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
because
it
was
a
consensual
entry
based
on
the
authority
of
one
who
appeared
to
have
the
ability
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
provided--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
certainly
not
a
necessary
pre-condition--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
see
that
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
