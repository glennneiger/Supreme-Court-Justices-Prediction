justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
officers
ask
her
if
she
was
currently
living
in
the
apartment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
he
didn't
ask
that
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
under
some
apparent
authority
doctrine
that
there
would
be
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
police
if
there
is
any
ambiguity
present
to
ask
appropriate
questions
to
determine
the
basis
of
the
person's
assumption
of
authority?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can
they
proceed
on
the
assumption
that
ignorance
is
bliss
or
do
they
have
some
obligation
to
inquire?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
would
have
been
pretty
simple
for
them
to
ask
a
few
more
questions,
wouldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you're
asking
for
an
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement
which
is
something
paramount
in
the
fourth
amendment
requirements.
it
seems
to
me
you're
suggesting
that
we
just
open
the
door
wide
without
any
corresponding
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
police
to
make
reasonable
inquiry.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
more
questions
had
been
asked
and
she
had
been
asked
by
the
police
whether
she
was
living
there
at
the
time
and
had
authority
to
enter
and
allow
others
to
enter,
and
she
said
yes,
yes,
yes,
i...
that's
where
i
live
and
i
have
that
authority,
would
it
be
all
right
then
for
the
police
to
enter?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
police
could--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--act
on
the
basis
of...
of
that
kind
of
information
if
it
were
objectively
reasonable.
