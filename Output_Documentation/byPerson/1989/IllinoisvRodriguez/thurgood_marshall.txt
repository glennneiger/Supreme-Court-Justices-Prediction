justice
thurgood
marshall
didn't
she
say
she
used
to
live
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
there
were--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--two
different
stories
then,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
doesn't
the
police...
didn't
the
police
require
to
show
present
apparent
authority
as
contrasted
to
she
used
to
live
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
policeman
is
going
to
justify
it
as
best
he
can.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
that
account--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--could
that
account
for
the
fact
that
later
on
he
said
she
testified
that
she
lived
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
couldn't
that,
counselor?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
obviously,
she
said
whatever
the
police
asked
her
to
say.
don't
you
gather
that
from
reading
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
witness
you're
relying
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
she
had
an
interest
in
the
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
some
part
it
says
"i
used
to
live
there".
i
used
to.
how
long
ago
was
the
used
to?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
she
said
she
used
to
live
there
at
one
time.
she
said
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
didn't
the--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--it
was
testimony
that
she
did
say
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
there's
a...
it's
not
a
clear-cut
point.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
counsel--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--i
have
a
hypothetical.
the
police
come
up
to
a
guy...
man
standing
outside
of
a
door
and
says,
we
want
to
go
in
there
and
lock
up
somebody
and
see
if
there's
any
dope
in
there,
is
it
okay
with
you?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you
let
me
finish?
he
says
is
it
okay
with
you?
you
say...
and
he
says,
yes.
you
say
he's
not
obliged
to
ask
any
questions?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
is
the
same
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
right.
well,
the
man
was
beaten
up
and
he
asks
them,
can
i
go
in
there.
is
that
enough,
the
fact
that
he
was
beaten
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
she
said
she
used
to
live
there.
was
that
a
question
that
was
asked
of
her?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
it
your
position
that
the
police
shouldn't
have
such
a
question?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
the
police
can
just
walk
in
wherever
they
want
to
walk
in?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they're
going
to
get
killed
one
of
these
days.
justice
thurgood
marshall
she
said
she
didn't.
she
inherently
said
she
didn't
live
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
meant
she
didn't
live
there
then.
