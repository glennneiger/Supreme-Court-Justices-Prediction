ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
from
the
illinois
appellate
court
which
upheld
the
suppression
of
defendant's
murder
confession
on
the
miranda
grounds.
the
ruling
precludes
the
use
of
undercover
agents
to
in
any
way
question
incarcerated
suspects
concerning
criminal
offenses
that
they
may
have
committed
and
it
ironically
arises
on
facts
which
affirmatively
establish
that
defendant
perkins
in
this
case
perceived
no
pressures
whatsoever
to
speak
when
making
his
incriminating
statements,
but,
rather,
he
was
simply
killing
time
with
boastful
admissions
to
those
whom
he
believed
to
be
co-conspirators
in
a
jail
break.
after
detailing
how
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination
is
seriously
threatened
whenever
a
suspect
is
subjected
to
the
inherently
compelling
pressures
of
custodial
interrogation,
this
court
in
miranda
developed
prophylactic
warnings
and
rules
to
provide
practical
reinforcement
for
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
however,
because
the
miranda
safeguards
of
a
protective
fifth
amendment,
and
because
they
markedly
decrease
the
number
of
wholly-reliable
statements
that
are
available
to
law
enforcement
for
both
investigation
and
prosecution
purposes,
this
court
has
characterized
those
safeguards
as
extraordinary
and
has
consistently
refused
to
apply
them
outside
the
context
of
the
inherently
compelling
custodial
interrogations
for
which
they
were
designed.
the
miranda's
principal
concern
was
that
mutually
reinforcing
manifestations
of
police
dominance
arising
from
custodial
interrogation
will
inevitably
exert
significant
pressures
on
an
accused
to
speak.
this
concern
is
entirely
inapposite
to
undercover
elicitation
statements.
a
suspect
who
is
in
immediate
and
non-transit
control
of
a
non-governmental
authority
who
also
at
the
same
makes
its
interest
at
eliciting
a
statement
apparent,
might
naturally
believe
that
he
has
no
right
to
speak
because
the...
the
authorities'
power
to
eventually
get
what
it
wants
is
immediately
suggested
by
its
power
of
restraint.
and
even
if
the
subject
is
not
subjected
to
any
further
incarceration,
additional
incarceration,
above
and
beyond
that
of
general
incarceration
itself,
other
potential
pressures
remain
because
the
suspect
will
still...
the
inmate
will
still
understand
that
speaking
will
accommodate
an
inquiring
government
that
not
only
has
the
proven
power
of
incarceration
but
also
has
future
control
over
his
physical
environment,
his
prosecution
and
other
aspects
of
his
life.
now,
where
a
suspect
doesn't
know
that
he's
encountering
a
governmental
agent,
he
can
feel
absolutely
none
of
these
pressures,
and
any
concern
in
miranda
for
perceived
governmental
domination
by
the
questioner
which
could
even
conceivably
be
reinforced
by
the
governmental's
power
of
incarceration
is
dispelled
by
the
deception
itself.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
clearly
the
due
process
clause
test
for
that
would
be
available
in
the--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--this
court
has
never
held
the
fifth
amendment
to
specifically
apply.
in
hoffa
the
court
assumed
that
the
fifth
amendment
applies
in
undercover
contacts.
this
court
has
never
specifically
held
the
fifth
amendment
to
apply
in
the
undercover
context.
but
the
due
process
test
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
fifth
amendment.
so,
the
due
process
clause
for
certain
would
be
available
to
remedy
that.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
for
compelled...
the
privilege
against
self--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--self-incrimination.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
oh,
of
course.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
of
course.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
there's
nothing
in
the
record--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--there's
nothing
in
the
record
to
indicate
whether
a
lawyer
was
appointed
or
not.
the
defendant
perkins
had
not
yet
appeared
before
the
court.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
correct.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
he
first
appeared
on
that...
the...
this
questioning
took
place
on
a
sunday
evening
and
he
appeared
on
monday
morning
for
the
first
time
on
the
aggravated
battery
charge,
and
it
was
at
that
time--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--that
he
was
arrested
for
the
murder.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
not
only
miranda's
concern
for
governmental
domination
doesn't
exist
in
undercover
context,
and
the
goal
of
deception
further
renders
under...
other
forms
of
pressure
less
likely
since
neither
the
undercover
agent
nor
identified
police
personnel
are
going
to
act
in
a
manner
that
would
risk
disclosure
of
their
identity.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
correct.
he...
the...
agency
parisi--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--was
an
undercover
police
officer
and
then
charlton
was--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--there's
no
reason
to...
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case
there
is
really
no
difference
between
the
way
agent
parisi
was
acting
and
the
way
informant
charlton
was
acting.
there's...
that
the...
focus
has
got
to
be
on
the
perceptions
of
the
suspect,
and
the
suspect...
if
the
suspect
doesn't
believe...
perceive
that
someone
is
a
governmental
agent,
then
it
makes
no
difference
if
he
really
is
a
police
officer
or
just
an
informant,
like
informant
charlton
in
this
case.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
no,
your
honor.
not
if
they--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--well,
the
informer
in
this
case
was
clearly--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
yes.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
your
honor,
we...
it's
not
our
position
that
the
fifth...
either
the
fifth
amendment
or
due
process
clause
could
have
conceivably
been
violated,
and
certainly
even...
even
miranda,
of
course,
has
not
been
violated
here
because
the
suspect,
defendant
perkins,
in
no
way
could
perceive
the
governmental
dominance,
the...
in
his
speaking
with
agent
parisi
and
informant
charlton.
there
was
no...
there's
no
purpose
for...
reason
to
apply
miranda
in
this
context
and
most
certainly
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
has
not
been
violated
vis-a-vis
either
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
due
process
clause.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
there
could
be
situations
where
trickery
amounts
to
coercion.
my
point
is
that
in
your
normal
everyday
undercover
situation
the
deception
itself
is
going
to
actually
take
away
the
coercion
that...
that
the
police
domination
type
coercion
that
miranda
was
concerned
with.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
there...
trickery
can
constitute...
it
would
be
trick
and
not
merely
trickery.
for
the
most
part,
trickery
will
never
come
close
to
any
kind...
even
present
pressure.
and,
again,
in
this...
the
undercover
context
here
the
very
trickery
of
not
allowing
the
suspect
to
know
that
you
are
acting
as
a
governmental...
governmental
agent...
that
very
trickery
takes
away
all
of
the
concerns
that
miranda
had
for
police
domination.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
certainly
not,
and
hoffa
made
that
clear.
in
hoffa,
which
was
not...
did
not
occur
in
the
prison...
but
this
court
stated
that
because
an
undercover
agent
was
involved,
there
was
absolutely
no
potential
for
coercion
at
all.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
because
afterwards--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--well,
when...
after
the...
after
the
questioning
occurred
in
this
case
on
a
sunday
evening
and
he
went
to
court.
then
he
was
charged
with
the
murder
to
which
he
had
confessed
the
evening
before.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
they
gave
him
his
miranda
rights
because--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--at
that
point
he
was
having
an
encounter
with
the
police
officer.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
yes.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
there's
the...
miranda
has
never
been
applied
outside
the
context
for
which
it
was
designed,
and
this
case
certainly...
and
any
undercover
case...
does
not
present
those
inherently
compelling
circumstances
that
require
the
prophylactic
miranda
warning.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
the
conditions
in
miranda
were...
were...
you
had...
you
have...
miranda
contemplated
a
police
officer
interrogating
a
suspect
in
custody
and
there
is...
there
is
a
potential
interplay
there
between
the
perception
of
the
suspect
in
terms
of
the
government...
the
governmental
power
of
incarceration
and
the
governmental
power--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--over
future
events
which
there
is
that
very
distinct
interplay
that
does--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--not
exist
in--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--but
he
didn't
perceive
the
government's
power--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--it
was
a
jail.
but
where
the
suspect
doesn't
perceive
that
he's
being
incarcerated
by...
where
he
doesn't
perceive
a
connection
between
the
governmental
power
of
his
questioner
and
the
government's
power
of
incarceration,
then
there's
no
interplay.
and
without
that
interplay
miranda
is
wholly
unnecessary.
the
entire
basis
of
miranda
is
to
provide...
was
to
give
directions--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--yes,
but
it--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--of
course,
and
we
are--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--we
aren't
disputing
the
fact
that
the
defendant
perkins
in
this
case
was
incarcerated.
the
question
is
whether
he
was...
whether
he
was
in
custody
for
purposes
of
miranda,
interrogated
for
purposes
of
miranda
and
whether
in
general
he
was
subjected
to
any
kind
of--
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
--the
difference
is
the
suspect
was
able
to...
that
in
miranda,
miranda
contemplated
the
situation
where
the
police
officer
is
a
known
police
officer...
is
interrogating
a
suspect.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
absolutely.
a
world
of
difference.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
the...
the
difference
is
that
when
a
suspect
doesn't
perceive
that
he's
speaking
to
a
governmental
agent
then
the...
those
pressures
that
miranda
was
talking
about,
the
pressures
of
police
domination,
can't
occur.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
because...
because
interrogation
is
not
sufficient.
it's
clear
that...
that
it's
not
an
inherently...
although
it
does
create
pressures
for
a...
for
an
individual
to
go
into
the
police
station
and
speak
with
the
police
officer.
that's
going
to
always
create
pressure.
but
it's
not
the
type
of
inherently
compelling
pressure
that
miranda
is
talking
about.
i
mean,
that's
why
miranda
also
requires,
and
this
court
has
subsequently
interpreted
miranda
to
require
both
custody
and
interrogation.
the...
the...
the...
the
only
risk
of
pressure
that
is...
necessarily
accompanies
undercover
questioning
in
the
jailhouse
arises
from
the
psychological...
that...
that
was
noted
by
this
court
in
henry...
the
psychological
need
to
reach
for
aid
when
a
person
is
in
confinement.
now,
even
in
the
sixth
amendment
context
where
the
very
concern
of...
is
interference
with
an
indicted
suspect's
right
to
protection
from
his
own
ignorance
in
confrontations
with
the
government.
even
there,
this
court
in
coleman
v.
wilson
held
it
permissible
for
an
undercover
cellmate
to
be
placed
in
a
cell
to
act
as
a
listening
post.
now,
for
an
undercover
agent
to
further
guide
that
conversation
by
crafty
questioning
would
establish
a
confrontation
in
which
the
suspect's
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
would
be
violated...
would
be...
clearly
have
been
circumvented.
but
that
same
conduct,
this
guiding
of
the
conversation
which
occurred
in
this
present
case,
can't...
doesn't
place
any
pressure
whatsoever
on
the
suspect
and
much
less
the
inherently
compelling
pressures
that
were
contemplated
by
miranda.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
marcia
l.
friedl
well,
your
honors,
if
there
aren't
any
questions,
for
all
the
reasons
presented
by
the
state
of
illinois
and
by
the
solicitor
general's
office,
we
request
that
the
illinois
appellate
court's
extension
of
miranda
be
reversed.
