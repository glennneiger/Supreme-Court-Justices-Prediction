mr.
dan
w.
evers
he's
a
government
agent.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
represent
the
respondent,
lloyd
perkins,
in
this
case.
we
come
before
this
court
today
requesting
your
honors
to
affirm
the
judgments
of
the
courts
below.
the
judgment
of
the
appellate
court
of
illinois,
fifth
judicial
district,
which
affirmed
the
order
of
the
circuit
court
of
st.
clair
county
suppressing
statements
made
by
my
client,
lloyd
perkins,
to
the
undercover
agent,
john
parisi.
it
is
our
contention
that
the
well-settled
law
and
principles
of
miranda
apply
to
this
case.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
our
closest
case?
mr.
dan
w.
evers
i
believe
almost
every
miranda
case
decided
by
this
court--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--in
terms
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
i
would
have
to
say
mathis,
followed
by
united
states
v.
henry.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
it
makes
any
difference
because
the
fifth
amendment
is
not
only
a
right
to
the
people,
but
a
limitation
upon
the
government
and
it's
directed
as
a
limitation
to
the
government--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--government,
and--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--it's
a
prophylactic
rule
against
coercive
governmental
action.
in
our
case
here
we
will
contend,
and
we
do
contend,
that
there
is
governmental
action
which
can
be
coercive.
and
that
coercion
is
found
in
the
trickery,
deceit,
cajoling
or
the
ruse
used
by
the
undercover
agent
here,
john
parisi.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
well,
i
would
suggest
that
trickery
and
deceit
is
a
subspecies
of
coercion.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
well,
in--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--terms
of
how
you
present
the
trickery,
i
think
that
it
can
be
coercion
because
if--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--the
form
of
the
trickery
can
lead
towards
the
coercion
by
compelling
the
person
to
believe
that
he
has
to
do
something
when
his
free
will
would
not
so
incline
him
to
do.
i
believe
that
you're
looking
at
coercion
as
merely
physical
force.
i
would
suggest
that
coercion
can
be
psychological
and
mental
force
also.
i
believe
that
it's
important
to
look
at
this
case
in
terms
of
what
the
procedural
posture
of
it
is
and
what
happened
in
the
courts
below
because
the
facts
of
the
case
are
this.
the
defendant
lloyd
perkins
was
charged
with
murder
in
the
circuit
court
of
st.
clair
county.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
he
filed--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--that's
belleville,
east
st.
louis.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
no,
your
honor.
mt.
vernon
is
jefferson
county
and
it's
several
miles
to
the
east.
after
the
charge
was
made,
the
defendant
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
the
confession.
a
hearing
was
held
before
the
circuit
court
of
st.
clair
county
at
which
evidence
was
presented.
this
evidence
is
the
facts
upon
which
the
circuit
court
based
its
decision.
its
decision
was
to
take
those
facts
and
apply
the
settled
law
of
miranda
to
it
and
conclude
whether
miranda
had
been
violated
or
whether
it
had
not
been
violated.
the
circuit
court
determined
as
a
factual
matter
that
miranda
had
been
violated.
it
concluded
that
the
defendant
was
in
custody,
he
was
in
jail.
it
concluded
that
he'd
been
interrogated
or
questioned.
parisi
and
charlton
specifically
questioned
the
defendant,
lloyd
perkins.
and
it
concluded
that
parisi
and
charlton
were
law
enforcement
agents
and
they
initiated
that
questioning.
those
are
the
facts
found
by
the
circuit
court.
when
the
state
filed
the
notice
of
appeal
from
that
decision,
it
went
to
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
and
in
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
the
state
had
to
bear
the
burden
of
showing
that
those
factual
determinations
were
incorrect,
were
manifestly
erroneous.
the
decision
of
the
appellate
court
of
illinois
is
nothing
more
than
a
statement
that
those
facts
were
not
manifestly
erroneous.
and
i
would
suggest
that
before
this
court...
after
the
state
loss
in
the
fifth
district
appellate
court,
a
petition
for
leave
to
appeal
to
the
illinois
supreme
court,
and
that
court
denied
leave
to
appeal
and
the
state
brought
this
cert
petition
which
this
court
grated...
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
also
look
at
what
happened
below
as
findings
of
fact
which
need
to
be
given
due
deference
because
they
are
not
manifestly
erroneous.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
i
would
agree
that
miranda--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--would
not
apply
for
the
very
important
reason--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--miranda
would
not
apply
to
the
hotel
situation--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--because
he
is
not
in
custody.
he
is
where
he
can
leave.
he
is
where
he
has
control
to
get
up
and
leave
whenever
he
wants.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
but
i
believe
the
key
difference
is
that
in
a
jail
he
is
in
a
police-dominated,
police-controlled,
government
institution
that--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--would
keep
him
from--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--i
would
not
say
that,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
jails
are
different.
jails
are
where
people
are
incarcerated,
they're
deprived
of
their
liberty,
and
the
government
has
an
obligation
to
treat
them
with
due
respect
towards
constitutional
principles.
and
one
of
those
principles,
i
would
suggest,
is
that
they
not
be
compelled
to
be
witnesses
against
themselves
and--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--against
their
free
will.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
i
would,
your
honor.
in
line
with
this
discussion,
i
would
like
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
case
does
not
involve
a
non-custodial
setting.
and
i
believe
that's
important
because
i
believe
the
jail
setting
is
the
most
important
point.
this...
this
case
does
not
involve
simply
an
informant
who
hears
something
in
the
jail
and
then
goes
tells
the
government.
this
case
involves
a
specific
designed
plan
to
elicit
incriminating
remarks
from
the
defendant,
lloyd
perkins.
and
this
is
not
just
something
that
was
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
by
the
police.
this
is
a
thought-out
plan
to
get
at
lloyd
perkins.
it's
been
thought
out
for
several
weeks.
and
when
they
discovered
that
he
was
at
the
montgomery
county
jail
in
which
he
was
incarcerated
at
the
time
for
aggravated
battery,
they
made
the
specific
decision
to
get
agent
parisi.
and
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
plain
holding
of
miranda,
you
will
see
that
this
case
falls
squarely
within
the
plain
holding
of
miranda
in
which
your
honors
stated
that
these
confessions
or
statements
cannot
be
used
unless
there
is
demonstrated
a
knowing
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
it's
not
that
they
were
not
able
to
go
and
talk
to
the
defendant
lloyd
perkins.
they
were
able
to
go
and
talk
to
him.
it's
that
they
were
not
able
to
use
that
information
unless
they
got
a
valid
voluntary
waiver.
i
don't
think
the
state
would
contend
at
all
that
if
a
uniform
police
officer
went
to
lloyd
perkins
in
his
cell
and
said,
i
want
to
talk
to
you,
that
he
had
to
give
miranda
to
the
defendant.
we
see
no
difference
between
the
uniformed
police
officer
and
the
undercover
agent.
they
are
both
agents,
law
enforcement
agents
of
the
state.
they
both
have
to
follow
the
dictates
of
miranda.
under
miranda
there
has
to
be
questioning
or
interrogation.
i
would
suggest
to
this
court
that
that
is
amply
demonstrated
by
the
record.
what
happened
is
that
charlton
and
parisi
went
to
lloyd
perkins,
spun
this
tale
and
then
started
asking
him
questions
specifically
designed
to
grab
the
information
that
they
wanted.
they
did
not
sit
around
and
just
talk
about
the
weather
or
talk
about
anything
that
was
of
no
consequence
and
lloyd
perkins
blurted
this
out.
they
talked
about
and
they
questioned
specifically
to
get
to
what
they
wanted.
and
when
lloyd
perkins
might
become
quiet,
they
would
chime
in
and
ask
another
question
designed
specifically
to
bring
something
else
out,
something
to
be
more
incriminating.
and,
of
course,
miranda
is
concerned
with
their
being
a
law
enforcement
agent
involved.
it's
not
just
the
fifth
amendment
that
is
important
because
there
was
questioning
and
there
was
custody.
it's
important
because
there's
a
governmental
agent
involved,
not
some
private
citizen.
the
key
concern
in
miranda
is
that
the
government
has
to
be
circumscribed
in
its
conduct
towards
its
citizens.
here
we
definitely
do
have
a
law
enforcement
agent.
he
was
an
undercover
agent
in
the
narcotics
trade.
he
was
a
police
officer,
and
he
was
sworn
to
uphold
the
laws
of
the
state
of
illinois
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
the
former
department
of
corrections
inmate,
charlton...
by
this
time
he
had
become
a
law
enforcement
agent
because
he
was
working
hand-in-hand
with
the
police.
he
was
following
the
dictates
and
plans
of
the
police
and
his
only
purpose
within
this
ruse
was
to
trick
and
cajole
lloyd
perkins
into
the
confidence
of
agent
parisi.
we
would
also
suggest
that
the
concerns
of
the
court
in
miranda,
concerns
that
powered
the
decision
of
that
court,
are
present
in
this
case.
in
miranda
this
court
was
concerned
about
trickery.
it
was
concerned
about
deceit.
it
was
concerned
about
the
police-dominated
atmosphere
of
custody
and
jails.
in
miranda
this
court
talked
about
the
psychological
ploys
that
could
be
employed
and
was
very
concerned
about
the
psychological
coercion
exerted
by
the
environment
in
custody.
to
touch
upon
a
concern
of
justice
marshall
a
little
while
ago,
if
this
case
is
ripped
out
from
the
cover
of
miranda,
then
you
will
simply
have
the
police
circumventing
miranda
by
using
undercover
agents
in
the
old
mutt
and
jeff
technique
in
which
now,
instead
of
jeff
being
the
good
cop,
he
has
become
the
good
companion,
the
good
inmate,
while
mutt
is
the
terrifying
police
officer
who
sets
up
and
produces
the
mental
coercion
in
the
defendant,
in
the
accused,
in
which
he
becomes
susceptible
to
the
ploys
and
trickery
of
the
undercover
agent.
if
this
court
removes
the
protections
of
miranda
from
these
situations,
then
you
will
simply
have
the
forms
of
psychological
coercion
being
moved
into
this
arena.
finally,
i'd
like
to
note
that
this
court
has
noted
that
this
is
a
factual
matter.
in
patterson
v.
illinois,
this
court
noted
that
surreptitious
conversations
between
an
undercover
police
agent
could
be
interrogation
under
miranda
and
miranda
would
apply.
under
footnote
9
of
patterson,
the
issue
is
not
whether
miranda
applies.
the
issue
is
the
factual
question
of
whether
there
is
custody,
whether
there
is
interrogation
and
whether
there
is
a
police
officer.
we
have
all
three
elements
in
this
case.
and
that's
what
this
court
has
to
focus
upon,
is
those
three
elements
of
miranda.
custody,
interrogation
and
questioning,
and
the
law
enforcement
officer
initiating
that
questioning.
consequently,
if
your
honors
do
not
have
any
other
questions--
mr.
dan
w.
evers
--charlton?
mr.
dan
w.
evers
in
my
view
it
would
not
because
under
my
view
of
the
case
charlton
is
a
law
enforcement
agent
by
this.
he
is
acting
under
the
authority
and
orders
of
the
police.
if
you're
asking
whether
the
undercover
agent
is
sitting
around
with
somebody
who
was
not
working
with
him
and
he
just
listened
to
a
conversation
between
those
two,
i
would
say
that
would
be
different,
that
there
was
no
interrogation
between
the
police
officer,
the
law
enforcement
agent,
and
these
two
inmates.
i
think
that
would
be
the
difference
between
a
listening
post
and
an
interrogator.
mr.
dan
w.
evers
consequently,
your
honors,
we
would
ask
that
you
affirm
the
judgments
below
and
affirm
the
suppression
of
the
statements.
