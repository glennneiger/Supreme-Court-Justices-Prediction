well,
we
know
you're
a
government
agent.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you--
--but
it's...
but
it's
not
true.
i
recommend
you
to
the
nearest
english
dictionary.
[laughter]
it's
the
difference
between
the
con
man
who
tricks
you
out
of
the
money
and
somebody
who
says,
give
me
your
money
or
i'll
break
your
leg.
i
mean,
you
don't
see
the
difference
between
those
two?
you
consider
both
of
those
to
be...
to
be
coercion?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
one--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
one
case
you
give
your
money
over
voluntarily.
in
the
other
case
it's
exacted
under...
under
threat
of
harm.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
evers,
if
trickery
is
just
as
bad
as...
as...
as
what...
what
we
normally
call
coercion,
why...
why
should
miranda
only
apply
to
trickery
when...
when
the
person
tricked
is
in
custody?
why...
why
isn't
it
just...
why
isn't
the
trickery
just
as
offensive,
and
why
isn't
there
just
as
much
coercion,
if
you
want
to
call
trickery
coercion
+/?
if
parisi
had...
had
approached
your
client
in
the
hotel
room
instead
of
in
jail,
would
you
apply
miranda
to
that
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
would...
would
not
apply?
would
not
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he's
being
tricked.
that's
just
to
say
that
he
isn't
being
coerced.
but
he's
being
tricked
just
as
much.
you
say
trickery
is
coercion.
he's
being
tricked
just
as
much
whether
he's
tricked
in
the
jail
or
out
of
the
jail.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
was
tricked.
he
wasn't
coerced,
he
was
tricked.
but
you
say
that's
enough,
tricking
is
enough.
but
it
seems
to
me
it
follows
from...
from
what
you
want
us
to...
to
hold
here
that
you
should
apply
miranda
everywhere
when...
when
there
is
trickery.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
it's
worse--
justice
antonin
scalia
--worse
to
be
tricked
in
my
home
than
i
do
in
jail.
i
would...
i
would
get
much
more
annoyed
at
a
government
that
comes
to
my
house
and
tricks
me
than...
than
one
that
tricks
me
when
i'm...
when
i'm
in
the
police
custody.
you
just
feel
differently
about
it?
