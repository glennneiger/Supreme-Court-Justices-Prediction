well,
ms.
friedl,
now,
if
the
undercover
agent
had
physically
beaten
the
prisoner
up
in
order
to
obtain
the
information,
do
you
think
the
fifth
amendment
might
preclude
the
use
of
that
information?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
fifth
amendment
would
preclude
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
there
is
a
concern
in
the
fifth
amendment
for
voluntariness,
isn't
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
if
the
undercover
agent
beat
it
out
of
him,
it
might
be
considered
compulsion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
was
there
a
lawyer
appointed
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--for
the
defendant
in
the
aggravated
battery
charge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
had
been
no
initial
appearance
for
the
aggravated
battery--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--when
this
occurred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
see.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
trickery
can
ever
amount
to
coercion?
