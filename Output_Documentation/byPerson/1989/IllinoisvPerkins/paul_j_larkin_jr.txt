mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but
the
question
is
are
you
going
to
interrogate
me.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
my
colleague
has
pointed
out,
the
police
practice
at
issue
in
this
case
is
categorically
different
from
the
one
that
the
court
addressed
in
miranda.
miranda
addressed
and
was
primarily
concerned
with
the
classic
police
stationhouse
interrogation.
and
the
later
cases
have
also
been
concerned
with
the
functional
equivalent
of
that...
interrogation
in
the
squad
car
or
at
the
scene
of
the
crime
after
a
person
has
been
arrested
and
handcuffed.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
mathis
involved
the
situation
in
which
the
person
was
in
custody
and
questioned
by
a
known
government
agent.
it's
the
latter
fact
that
is
absent
here.
now,
we've
also
taken
the
view
in
point
a
in
our
brief
that
the
mere
fact
that
someone
is
in
jail
does
not
automatically
mean
he
must
be
given
miranda
warnings
because
the
context
in
which
there
is
some
type
of
questioning
should
also
be
considered.
but
in
this
case
the
primary
difference
between
the
factual
situation
we
have
and
what
you
had
in
mathis
was
this
was
an
undercover
agent.
as
my
colleague
has
pointed
out,
that
really
distinguishes
this
case
greatly.
in
fact,
the
fact
that
respondent
was
in
jail
was
really
significant
in
this
case
for
only
two
reasons.
one,
it
allowed
the
police
to
find
him.
after
all,
the
police
tried
to
put
charlton
and
respondent
together
outside
of
jail,
at
a
motel,
in
order
to
find
out
if
respondent
was
responsible
for
the
stevenson
murder,
but
respondent
was
nowhere
to
be
found.
they
found
him
in
a
jail
and
then
they
had
to
try
something
else.
secondly,
the
fact
that
respondent
was
in
jail
meant
that
officer
parisi
could
approach
him
with
a
phony
escape
plan
rather
than
use
some
other
type
of
ruse,
such
as
the
ruse
they
would
have
used
if
they
had
found
respondent
at
the
motel.
but
the
fact
that
he
was
in
jail
did
not
in
any
way
coerce
him
into
confessing.
look
at
the
case
from
his
perspective
and
look
at
the
setting
in
which
he
found
himself.
did
respondent
confess
in
order
to
avoid
having
the
book
thrown
at
him
by
a
known
police
officer?
no.
respondent
thought
he
was
hatching
an
escape
plot
with
two
fellow
prisoners.
did
respondent
confess
because
he
believed
that
the
agent
had
some
authority
to
force
him
to
confess?
respondent
confessed
because
he
believed
that
the
agent
was
in
fact
vito
bianco,
a
fellow
hit
man,
who
could
be
trusted
with
respondent's
secret.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
would...
it
would
depend
because
it's...
it's
the
part
of
your
hypo
that
would
have
to
be
elaborated.
if
you
don't
have
any
real
break,
unlike
here
where
you
really
do,
then,
as
a
practical
matter,
you
could
say
that
some
of
the
intimidating
presence
of
the
police
officer
would
immediately
carry
over.
i
mean,
for
example,
if
they
brought
a
police
officer
disguised
as
a
reporter
in
immediately
after
the
defendant--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
those
are
two
different--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yeah.
they're
two
different
hypos
and
i
would
give
different
answers
to
each
one.
i
would
say
that
miranda
wouldn't
apply
to
either
one,
but
the
latter
one,
with
the
priest,
would
violate
due
process.
not
the
newspaper
reporter.
and
so
for
purposes
of
this
case,
they
would...
since
this
involves
only
miranda,
they
would
be
treated
the
same.
there's
no
intimidating
presence
there.
i
mean,
in
that
sort
of
circumstance,
unlike...
you
know,
unlike
this
case--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
it
would
be
a
violation
of
due
process
because
it
would
be...
it
would
fit
within
one
half
of
the
two
concerns
the
court
has
in
confession
cases.
one
half
on
the
due
process
is
whether
or
not
the
police
practice
is
likely
to
elicit
a
false
confession.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
this
fits
in
the
second
half--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--which
is
whether
or
not
the
practice
is
one
that
is
offensive
to
civilized
standards
of
decency.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
there
are...
one,
dealing
with
someone
who's
about
to
commit
a
crime
isn't
one
that
society
is
unwilling
to
allow
the
police
to
do.
it's
an
essential
part
of
law
enforcement.
it's
like
sending
in
an
undercover
officer
to...
to
purchase
narcotics
in
a
crack
house.
in
the
case
of
a
priest,
society,
i
think,
is
unwilling
to
allow
the
police
to
do
that
because
it
may
prey
on
a
person's
peculiar
sensibilities.
it's
one
that,
you
know,
society
has
always
recognized.
that's
why,
for
example,
society
generally
would,
i
guess,
recognize
a
communication
in
confidence
in
that
context.
but
communications,
like
the
ones
here
that
are
designed
to
put
together
an
escape
plot
and
to
beat
up
an
elderly
prison
guard
in
the
process,
don't
even
remotely
fall
into
that
for
the
circumstance.
so
i
don't
think
society
would
put
this
type
of
practice
that
we
have
here
out
of
bounds.
in
fact,
but
for
the
fact
that
this
was
a
jail
cell--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
it--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--it
doesn't
turn
on
the
fact
that
he
agreed
to...
to
beat
up
a
prison
guard.
what
it
does,
i
think,
is
add
a
little
context
to
what
happened.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
coloring
is
important.
i
mean,
after
all,
the
reason
for
having
a
police
officer
there
is
a
big
distinction,
a
crucial
one,
we
believe...
is
that
it
was
essential
to
miranda
that
the
suspect
would
know
that
the
person
sitting
across
the
table
from
him
in
a
police
interrogation
room
was
a
police
officer.
the
police
officer
is
the
one
who
holds
the
suspect's
fate
in
his
hands.
the
police
officer
is
the
one
who
may
instill
in
the
suspect
the
belief
that
unless
he
confesses
he'll
never
be
released,
or
that
if
he
is
silent
and
stands
on
his
rights,
he
is
likely
to
pay
a
very
dear
price
for
it.
so
there...
that...
these
sort
of
facts
are
important.
and
undercover
officer,
by
definition,
can't
use
the
fact
that
he's
a
police
officer
as
a
means
of
intimidation.
an
undercover
officer
obviously
can't
threaten
someone
who
is
already
in
jail
when
the
officer
is
posing
as
a
fellow
prisoner,
with
having
the
authority
to
keep
that
other
person
in
custody
until
he
confesses.
the
only
weapon
open
to
an
undercover
officer
is
guile.
and
that,
as
the
court
has
recognized
in
cases
such
as
hoffa,
in
cases
such
as
atchley,
in
cases
such
as
frazier
v.
cupp--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
this--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
at
the...
at
that
level
that
doesn't
distinguish
this
case
from
atchley.
it--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
in
atchley--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--hoffa
was
not
but
atchley
was.
atchley
was
questioned
by
an
undercover,
by
an
insurance
agent
who
was
wired.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
atchley
was
in
prison
and
he
was
questioned
by--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes.
prison
or
jail.
he
was
questioned
by
an
insurance--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
no.
i
didn't
say
hoffa.
i
said
atchley.
in--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
i
agree.
there's
that
difference
between
this
case
and
hoffa.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
because--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
promise
i
won't
bring
it
up
again.
[laughter]
but
that...
that
sort
of
fact...
even
though
i
won't
mention
the
name
of
the
case...
is...
is
crucial
to
looking
at
this
sort
of
problem.
as
we've
explained
in
our
brief
and
as
the
state
has
explained
in
its
brief
and
at
oral
argument,
the
fact
is
really
that
he
was
not
subject
to
a
custodial
interrogation,
which
is
a
concept.
it's
not
simply
custody,
it's
not
simply
an
interrogation
in
its
entire
concept.
this
scenario
here
doesn't
engage
the
types
of
concerns
that
gave
rise
to
miranda,
and
obviously
it
can't
be
regulated
by
the
same
ground-rules
without
simply
forbidding
it
altogether.
for
the
reasons
we've
given
in
our
brief
and
that
i've
tried
to
summarize
here,
because
this
is
not
the
same
type
of
setting
and
can't
be
regulated
in
the
same
way,
the
police
shouldn't
be
made
to
try
to
act
in
the
same
way.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
