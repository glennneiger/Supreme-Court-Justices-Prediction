mr.
larkin,
let
me
give
you
another
hypothetical.
supposing
he's
in
the
interrogation
room
and
they
brought
in
a
police
officer
and
they
passed
him
off
as
a
newspaper
reporter.
so
this
newspaper
reporter,
he
wants
to
interview
you
for
some
future
story,
and
they
sold
him
a
bill
of
goods
in
selling
the
book
rights,
or
something,
to
his
story.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
no.
i
say
before
any
of
that
happens.
so,
there's...
there's
no...
no...
they
just...
he's
in
custody.
the
only...
he's,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
custody
but
he's
not
been
threatened
in
any
way
or
no
intimidating
circumstances
other
than
the
fact
that
he's
in
custody,
just
as
this
man
is
in
custody.
and
you
just...
instead
of
using
a
fellow
inmate,
you
just
use
somebody
dressed
up
as
a
reporter
or
a...
or
a...
how
about
a
priest?
and
say
he's...
come
in
and
say,
i'd
like
you
to
tell
me
what
really
happened.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
police...
a
police
officer
dressed
as
a
priest,
i
mean.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
is
the...
why
is
the
priest...
phony
priest
a
violation
of
due
process?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that
certainly
wouldn't
elicit
false
confessions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
is
that
so
offensive?
i
mean,
why
is
that
any
more
offensive
than
sending
in
another
fellow
saying,
i
want
to...
let's
go
out
and
escape
together?
i
mean,
why...
i
don't
know
why
a
phony
priest
is
any
more
offensive
than
a
phony
prison
break.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
summarize
it.
your...
your
basic
position
is
this
is
not
a
miranda
case,
this
is
a
due
process
case,
and
there's
nothing
offensive
about
the
practice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
just
one
question,
if
i
may.
would
the
case
be
different
in
your
view
if
the
law
enforcement
officer
said
nothing
and
the
other
inmate
did
all
the
questioning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
have
the
names
in
my--
