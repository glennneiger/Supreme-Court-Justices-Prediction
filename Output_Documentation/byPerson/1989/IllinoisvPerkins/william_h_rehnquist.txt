we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-1972,
illinois
v.
lloyd
perkins.
ms.
friedl,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
you...
i
would
have
answered
that
question
from
justice
o'connor
perhaps
a
little
differently.
do
you
think
trickery
is
a
subspecies
of
coercion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
trickery
might
pose
other
questions.
but
it
certainly
doesn't...
it
isn't
the
same
thing
as
coercion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
friedl.
mr.
evers.
no,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
larkin.
i
should
have
resorted
back
to
my
chart.
i'm
sorry.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
your...
yeah,
okay.
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
now
it's
your
turn,
mr.
evers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
coercion...
if
you
look
up
coercion
in
the
dictionary,
it
means
something
quite
different
from
trickery
or
ruse
or
deceit.
coercion
means,
you
know,
overwhelming
the
person
with
the
threat
of
government
force
in
some
way.
trickery
or
deceit
may
have
equally
significant
consequences
for
his
decision,
but
they're...
they're
not
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
evers.
ms.
friedl,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
friedl.
the
case
is
submitted.
