just
one
point.
this
man
wasn't
an
undercover
agent,
he
was
a
policeman,
wasn't
he?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
there
a
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
don't
you
draw
a
line
between
policemen
and
undercover
agents?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
don't
see
any
difference
between
a
policeman
and
an
informer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
thought...
i
thought
a
policeman
represented
the
state,
officially
sworn
to
duty,
and
an
informer
was
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that...
is
that
correct?
that
a
policeman
represents
the
state
as
an
officer
of
the
state,
sworn
as
an
officer
of
the
state
to
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
is
that
correct?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
this
man
was
sworn
to
uphold
the
constitution
of
the
united
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
violated
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
did
they
give
this
man
miranda
rights
afterwards?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
mean,
if
they
didn't
have
to
give
them
before,
why...
what...
what
period
was
there
when
they
decided
they
gave
him
miranda
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
they
gave
him
miranda
rights?
justice
thurgood
marshall
after.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
gave
him
miranda
rights
after
he
was
brought
to
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
case
that
supports
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
was
the
difference
between
the
conditions
in
miranda
and
the
conditions
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--power
of
incarceration
was
the
same
in
both,
wasn't
it?
he
was
in
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn't...
it
wasn't
the
same
jail,
but
it
was
a
jail.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
in...
in
case
you
don't
know
it,
incarceration
is
incarceration.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
are
in
jail--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and
i
don't...
i
don't
know
of
any
difference.
jails
are
jails.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
was
the
difference
between
the
interrogation
here
and
in
miranda?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any...
is
there
any
difference
between
the
known
police
officer
and
the
unknown
police
officer?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that...
well,
what
is
the
other
difference?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
did
they
insist
that
he
be
in
custody
in
miranda?
justice
thurgood
marshall
there
was
another
difference
in
hoffa.
hoffa
was
not
in
custody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
say
it's
the
same
as
hoffa?
justice
thurgood
marshall
just
ignore
the
fact
that
hoffa
was
not
in
custody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
in
custody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
was
in
prison?
justice
thurgood
marshall
hoffa
was
in
his
office
in
his
home.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i'm
talking
about
hoffa.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
do
you
keep
bringing
it
up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
promise
not
to
bring
it
up
again?
