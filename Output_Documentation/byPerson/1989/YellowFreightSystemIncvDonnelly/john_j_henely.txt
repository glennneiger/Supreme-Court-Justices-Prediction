mr.
john
j.
henely
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
because
of
the...
the
test
or
the
principle
announced
in
gulf...
gulf
offshore
and
recently,
five
weeks
ago,
in
taflin,
namely
that
three-prong
approach,
does
the
statute
itself
express
that
state
court
shall
not
have
jurisdiction,
which
we
don't
have
here,
and
then,
secondly,
a
look
at
legislative
intent
and,
thirdly,
a
look
at
the
nature
of
the
federal
law
and
whether
or
not
it's
incompatible
with
being
heard
by
the
state
courts,
i
have
to
address
what
counsel
for
yellow
freight
calls
the
touchstone
of
their
argument,
namely
that
there
is
legislative
intent
here
from
the
congressional
debates
that
the
sovereign
power
of
state
courts
to
hear
federal
cases,
which
is
rooted
in
our
federal
system,
is
removed
by
an
examination
of
intent
from
what
certain
senators
or
congressmen
said
or
didn't
say
in
a
bill
such
as
title
vii,
which,
frankly,
was...
it
was
amended
87
times
in
83
days.
later
on
i
have
some
problem
with
that
analysis,
but
i
must
face
it
head-on.
if
there
was
any
mention
in
the
legislative
history
of
state
courts...
and
there
are
none,
it's
all...
it's
always
federal
courts,
federal
judiciary...
my
position
would
be
more
difficult
because
it
would
at
least
evince
some
debate
on
the
issue
that
we
are
here
on,
whether
or
not
we
intend,
congress,
by
enacting
title
vii
to
oust
or
divest
the
state
courts
from
hearing
these
claims.
mr.
john
j.
henely
in
the...
in
the
legislative
history?
mr.
john
j.
henely
oh,
most
certainly.
mr.
john
j.
henely
oh,
that's...
that's
another
way
of
putting
it.
reasonable
men
may
differ,
as
they
have
certainly
throughout
the
federal
courts
in
deciding
this
issue,
as
to
whether
that's
enough,
but...
and
that's
one
of
the
problems
of
looking
at
it.
mr.
john
j.
henely
well,
and
then
you'd
have
to
say,
well,
whether
it
was
a
proponent
or
an
opponent
it's
a
problem
area.
at
any
rate,
my
point
in
this
area
is
very
simply
that
there's
no
record
in
all
of
the
congressional
talk
about
this
bill
that
there
was
a...
a
consideration
of
the
issue
shall
we
not
let
these
cases
be
filed
in
the
state
courts.
i
frankly
don't
think
they
thought
about
it
or
talked
about
it.
mr.
john
j.
henely
yes,
justice--
mr.
john
j.
henely
--yes.
mr.
john
j.
henely
they
read
into--
mr.
john
j.
henely
--the
legislative
history
what
they
wanted
to.
valenzuela
never
ever
looks
at
incompatibility;
it
only
looks
at
legislative
history.
judge
bower
in
easterbrook
in
the
seventh
circuit
looked
at
legislative
history
and
came
up
with
a
different
conclusion,
as
did
judge
layton
in
the
district
court.
i
think
that's
the
problem
with
legislative
intent
in
the
context
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
as...
as
a
test.
mr.
john
j.
henely
well,
congress
certainly
has
the
power
to
tag
on
procedural
provisions
to
any
enactment.
there
is
talk
in
the
legislative
history
of
a
federal
court
backlog
of
19
or
20
months
at
the
time
in
1964.
i
think
the
answer
is
they
were
concerned
about
long
delays
for
both
plaintiffs
and
claimed-against
defendants--
mr.
john
j.
henely
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
john
j.
henely
well,
it...
it
may
be
eventually,
if
this
court
holds
concurrent
jurisdiction,
that
an
issue
will
arise
sometime
in
the
future
that
state
courts
in
hearing
title
vii
cases
must
expedite
them
as
the
statute
states.
a
possible
future
issue.
at
any
rate,
the
legislative
history
is
not
a
one-way
street
in
this
regard.
this
court
made
some
observations
in
the
kremer
decision
which
indicates
concurrent
state
court
jurisdiction.
for
example,
one
of
the
original
proposals
in
the
title
vii
debates
was
that
those
states...
and
at
the
time
half
of
the
states
had
their
own
fair
employment
practices
laws...
those
states
which
had
fep
laws,
the
jurisdiction
of
title
vii
would
not
apply
to
them.
it
follows
from
that
that
if
that
were
the
enactment
of
title
vii,
certainly
there
would
be...
have
to
be
concurrent
state
court
jurisdiction
with
regard
to
fair
employment
practices
laws.
there
are
statements
with
regard
to...
by
senator
humphrey
that
this
employment
of
title
vii
here
is
to
implement
and
broaden
rather
than
supplant
the
existing
state
court
laws
and
procedures
for
adjudicating
employment
practices
complaints.
the
language
and
the
set-up
of...
of
the
statute
itself,
with
the
interplay
between
eeoc
and
the
involvement
of
state
court
agencies
right
in
the
statute,
in
my
view,
suggests
an
attempt
to
involve
the
states.
and
if
we're
going
to
involve
the
states,
it
makes
sense
to
involve
the
judicial
power
of
the
states
as
well.
at
any
rate,
i
think
that,
depending
on
what
one
is
looking
for
in
the
legislative
history
of
title
vii,
one
may
find
support
that
there
is
an
implication
one
way
or
another.
mr.
john
j.
henely
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
you
mean
through
the
attorney
general?
mr.
john
j.
henely
i
don't
believe
so.
what
i
want
to
talk
about
briefly
is
the
idea
of...
of
taflin
so
recently
decided
by
this
court,
issues
very,
very
close
to
this
one,
involved.
it
is
suggested
that
one
of
the
implications
from
the
fact
that
congress
put
procedural
requirements
in
title
vii,
mentioning
appeals
to
federal
courts,
mentioning
injunctions,
mentioning
expedited
assignment
to
a
district
court
judge
or,
if
he
can't
hear
it,
then
to
a
magistrate.
there
were
issues
in...
in
the
rico
taflin
case
regarding
procedures...
nationwide
service,
venue,
et
cetera...
which
certainly
were
not
a
stumbling
block
to
a
finding
that
since
congress
has
not
excluded
the
state
courts
from
jurisdiction
under
rico,
state
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction.
going
back
to
claflin,
hundred-year-ago
decision,
but
the
reading
of
it
makes
some
sense.
mr.
justice
bradley,
in
deciding
an
issue
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
arising
out
of
the
bankruptcy
laws
of
1867,
relies
very
heavily
on
alexander
hamilton's
number
82
federalist.
that
was
written
one
year
before
the
judicial
act,
and
hamilton
sets
forth
his
ideas
of
federalism
as
applied
to
the
judicial
power
and
concurrent
jurisdiction.
and
hamilton
says
that,
because
of
the
supremacy
clause,
the
federal
courts...
the
federal
legislature,
congress,
can
exclude
state
court
jurisdiction
basically
in
two
ways.
one,
by
just
expressing
it
in
the
statute
or,
secondly,
by
implication
arising
out
of
an
incompatibility
with
the
federal
enactment
and
its
being
decided
with
state
courts.
he
makes
no
mention
of
taking
a
look
at
legislative
intent
by
way
of
history,
maybe
just
because
it
was
brand
new.
but
mr.
justice
bradley
in
claflin
does
not
suggest
that
a
look
at
legislative
history
gives
us
a
clear
answer
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
incompatibility.
and
in
reviewing
this
issue
and
the
work
involved,
in...
in
having
a
principle
upon
which
we're
going
to
decide
whether
or
not
in
future
cases
there
is
exclusive
jurisdiction
or
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction,
and
in
looking
at
the
fact
that
the
federal
courts
who
have
decided
the
question
in
this
case
have
had
different
opinions
on
it,
reasonable
men
can
differ
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
unmistakable
implication
in
the
legislative
intent
not
expressed
in
the
statute.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
if
there
is
a
look
at
legislative
intent,
it
must
be
tied
into
the
basis
for
it.
what
is
the
basis
of
congress
intending
to
remove
state
court
jurisdiction?
what
is
the
reason?
the
answer
has
to
be
that
there
is
some
basic
incompatibility
between
our
federal
enactment
here,
this
law,
and
it
being
decided
by
state
courts.
one
of
the
district
courts
who
held
concurrent
jurisdiction
in
here
in
indiana
sent
a
law
clerk
to
look
through
55
titles
of
the
federal
code
and
found
out
that
72
times
congress
had
expressly
divested
states
from
concurrent
jurisdiction.
they...
they
know
how
to
do
it.
there's
no
question
about
it.
my
final
point
is
that
if
concurrent--
mr.
john
j.
henely
--no.
mr.
john
j.
henely
no,
no.
not
at
all.
i...
i
submit
that...
that--
mr.
john
j.
henely
--i
follow
alexander
hamilton.
mr.
john
j.
henely
that
was
not
my
point.
i
believe
that
courts
must
look
at
the
incompatibility
issue.
i
don't
think
a
look
at
legislative
intent
is
determinative
or
decisive
without
coupling
it
to
the
rationale,
the
basis,
which
has
to
be
incompatibility.
my
final
suggestion
is
that
absolutely
no
harm
is
done
to
the
federal
purpose
of
title
vii
or
to
the
parties
in
any
title
vii
issue
if
state
court
concurrent
jurisdiction
is
found.
a
plaintiff
may
choose
federal
court.
or,
if
he
chooses
state
court,
a
defendant
may
remove.
any
peculiarly
strategic
advantages
of
the
federal
court
are
preserved
to
either
plaintiff
or
defendant
under
concurrent
jurisdiction,
whereas,
if
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
found,
we
have
problems
because
of
preclusion,
that
if
issues
of
discrimination
are
adjudicated
by
a
state
court,
the
federal
courts
will
apply
res
judicata
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
in
the
state
court
the
plaintiff
could
not
have
title
vii
as
the
basis
of
his
complaint.
for
all
of
those
reasons,
i
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
seventh
circuit.
thank
you
very
much.
