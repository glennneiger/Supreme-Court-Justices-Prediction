justice
white
well,
you
don't
suggest
that
there
would
have
to
be
some
express
mention
of
state
courts,
do
you?
justice
white
uh-huh.
justice
white
you
do?
well,
what
if
the
legislative
history...
assuming
legislative
history
could
get
the
job
done
in
the
first
place,
what
if
the
legislative...
it
was
clear
that
everybody
said,
these
suits
may
only
be
brought...
may
be
brought
only
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
the
legislative
history
is
equivalent
to
that
kind
of
a
statement,
that
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
they
really
meant
to
have
these
suits
brought
only
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
white
has
the
united
states
appeared
in
any
of
these
court
of
appeals
cases
and
expressed
its
opinion
on--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
are
you
suggesting
then
that
we
just
hold
that
the
law
either...
on
its
face
must
exclude
state
court
jurisdiction--
justice
white
--or
that
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction?
justice
white
well,
i
would
think--
justice
white
--that
might
be...
that
might
be
one
suggestion
you
might
make.
justice
white
well,
this
plaintiff
chose
the
state
court,
didn't
it?
justice
white
well,
so
there
will
be
some
that
will
forego
the
advantages
of
the
federal
court,
or
try
to.
justice
white
well,
you
really
have
to
gather
something
out
of
the
legislative
history
other
than
a
desire
to
make...
to
make
a...
the
federal
courts
available
to
a
plaintiff
and
to
have
an
expeditious
procedure
available
for
the
plaintiff
in
the
federal
courts.
you
have
to
go
on
and
say
that...
that
that's
the
only
judicial
system
that
the
plaintiff
may
choose.
justice
white
did
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
decided
for
your
position,
did
they...
did
they
rely
exclusively
on
the
legislative
history
or
did
they
find
some
incompatibility?
justice
white
and
those
were
thought
to
be
incompatible
with
state--
justice
white
--jurisdiction?
justice
white
well,
actually,
incompatibility
would
just...
itself
just
be
evidence
of
congressional
intent,
wouldn't
it?
