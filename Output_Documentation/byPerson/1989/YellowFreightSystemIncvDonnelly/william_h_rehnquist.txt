chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-431,
yellow
freight
system,
inc.
v.
colleen
donnelly.
mr.
pasek.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i...
i
think
we've
had
cases,
haven't
we,
mr.
pasek,
where
the
congressional
enactment
will
talk
about
authorizing
a
suit
in
the
united
states
district
court
and
we've
said
that
that
is
not
sufficiently
negativing
the
idea
of
state
court
jurisdiction.
it
seems
to
me
where
someone
is
talking
about
the
rules
of
evidence
that
are
going
to
govern,
they
say,
well,
sure,
it's
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
they're
contemplating
suits
in
the
federal
district
court.
but
under
our
cases,
i
don't
think
that's
enough
to
exclude
state
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
your
view,
mr.
pasek,
supposing
that
congress
wanted
to
specify
the
appeal
procedure
in
federal
courts,
what
more
should
it
have
done
to
indicate
that...
if
it
were
of
the
mind
that
state
courts
should
have
jurisdiction,
too?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
we've...
we've
said
in
our
cases
on
this
issue,
have
we
not,
that
the
granting
of
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
district
courts
is
not
sufficient
to
show
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
should
specifying
appeal
from
the
federal
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
be
any
different
than
the
granting
of
federal
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
for
that
purpose?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
pasek.
mr.
henely.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
henely.
do
you
have
rebuttal,
mr.
pasek?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pasek.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
89-431,

verus
donnelly
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
