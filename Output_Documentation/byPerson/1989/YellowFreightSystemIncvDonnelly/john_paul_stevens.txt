justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
respondent
filed
a
complaint
in
a
state
court,
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county,
alleging
that
the
petitioner
had
discriminated
against
her
because
she
is
a
woman
in
violation
of
the
illinois
human
rights
act
and
also
title
vii
of
the
federal
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
petitioner
removed
the
case
to
federal
court
and
moved
to
dismiss
arguing
in
part
that
the
complainant
in
state
court
could
not
toll
a
statute
of
limitations
for
a
title
vii
claim
because
the
state
courts
have
no
jurisdiction
over
title
vii
claims.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
today,
we
hold
that
the
state
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
with
federal
courts
over
title
vii
claims.
the
text
of
the
act
does
not
provide
for
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
further
although
the
legislative
history
and
procedural
provisions
of
the
act
suggest
strongly
that
congress
may
have
assumed
that
all
title
vii
claims
would
be
brought
in
a
federal
court.
these
factors
do
not
overcome
the
strong
presumption
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
federal
actions
by
state
courts.
accordingly,
the
judgment
below
is
affirmed.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
