mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
federal
courts
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
claims
arising
under
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
as
amended.
the
proceedings
here
began
with
a
complaint
filed
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
under
the
illinois
human
rights
act.
because
there
was
no
attempt
made
to
exhaust
administrative
remedies
under
illinois
law,
yellow
freight
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
that
complaint
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
and
the
plaintiff
sought
leave
to
amend.
an
agreed
order
was
entered
under
which
the
state
law
complaint
was
dismissed
with
prejudice
and
the
motion
for
leave
to
amend
was
continued.
five
days
later
yellow
freight
filed
a
removal
petition
and
the
federal
district
court
eventually
granted
leave
to
amend.
yellow
freight
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss,
arguing
that
any
filing
by
colleen
donnelly
was
ineffective
because
federal
courts
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
title
vii
claims.
the
parties
have
agreed
in
this
case
that
the
law
governing
this
was
set
forth
by
the
court
in
gulf
offshore
and
recently
reapplied
by
the
court
in
its
taflin
decision,
that
the
presumption
in
favor
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
is
a
rebuttable
one
and
that
it
may
be
rebutted
either
explicitly
or
implicitly,
explicitly
by
statutory
directive,
which
is
not
present
in
this
case,
or
from
the
unmistakable
implication
from
legislative
history,
or
by
demonstration
of
a
clear
incompatibility
between
state
court
jurisdiction
and
the
federal
interest.
we
submit
that
the
touchstone
for
this
inquiry
is
congressional
intent
and
that
the
court
must
examine
facts
such
as
the
language
structure
and
legislative
history
of
the
act
in
order
to
determine
whether
congress
intended
to
confer
exclusive
jurisdiction
on
federal
courts.
when
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
was
adopted,
it
was
against
a
background
of
debate
over
state's
rights,
and
the
compromise
model
which
congress
eventually
settled
on
initiated
with
a
model
patterned
after
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
had
cease
and
desist
powers
and
which
would
have
provided
for
appeals
to
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
and
no
resort
at
all
to
the
trial
courts
of
general
jurisdiction.
under
such
a
model,
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
the
garner
case,
there
would
have
been
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
over
those
claims.
thus,
it
is
not
surprising
that
when
the
promoters
of
the
bill
accepted
a
compromise
of
private
suits
for
title
vii
violations,
they
presumed
that
those
suits
would
be
brought
in
the
federal
district
court.
there
is
thus
no
reference
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
new
rights
which
were
being
created
would
be
enforceable
in
the
state
courts,
and
it
was
the
common
understanding
that
the
enforcement
was
to
be
in
the
federal
courts.
representative
mccollouch,
for
example,
who
was
the
ranking
republican
on
the
judiciary
committee,
noted
that
there
were
several
members
of
the
committee
who
preferred
that
the
ultimate
determination
of
discrimination
rests
with
the
federal
judiciary.
the
clark
case
interpretative
memorandum
provided--
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
--excuse
me?
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
yes,
sir.
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
but
in
either
case,
it's
the
federal
authorities
who
will
be
making
the
decision
under
the
statute.
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
the
statement
was
not
made
in
that
context.
the
statement
was
made
against
the
context
of
whether
there
would
be
administrative
cease
and
desist.
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
well,
the...
it
is
consistent
with
a
whole
series
of
other
comments
made
by
the
supporters
of
the
legislation,
the
court
model,
that
consistently
used
reference
to
the
federal
courts.
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
there
is
no
discussion
whatsoever
about
any
role
for
the
state
courts.
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
when
the
congress
talks
about,
as
senator
cotton
said,
that
the
process
will
lead
to
one
place,
the
door
of
the
federal
court,
he
was
by
implication
excluding
the
door
of
the
state
court
from
resolving
those
cases.
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
in
this
case
there
was
explicit
consideration
of
the
role
of
the
states
in
dealing
with
employment
discrimination
claims.
and
as
congress
was
clear
to
point
out,
the
state
role
was
limited
to
state
enforcement
of
state
law
under
the
deferral
process
established
in
section
706(c).
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
deferral
process
congress
established
if
you
were
to
say
that
the
plaintiff
would
be
required
to
pursue
remedies
under
state
or
local
law
for
60
days,
then
that
process
is
to
be
shifted
over
to
the
federal
equal
employment
opportunity
commission
for
at
least
180
days,
following
which
the
aggrieved
individual
could
then
file
suit
presumably
in
the
state
court,
if
that
were
the
case.
there
would
be
no
reason
to
prohibit
the
state
officials
initially
from
hearing
the
federal
claim
if
congress
intended
that
these
claims
could
be
brought
in
the
state
court
in
the
first
instance.
there
was
in
the
1972
legislative
history,
again,
repeated
discussion
about
the
role
of
the
federal
courts
in
language
which
we
submit
leaves
it
unmistakable
that
congress
presumed
that
the
federal
courts
would
have
exclusive
jurisdiction.
in
the
house,
representative
erlenborn
offered
the
amendment
for
a
court
enforcement
model,
and
in
distinguishing
between
the
procedures
that
would
apply
in
the
administrative
context
versus
the
court
enforcement
model,
he
said
that
the
rules
of
evidence,
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
that
apply
in
the
courts,
the
federal
district
courts,
as
"my
bill
would
require
any
case
to
be
tried
there,
those
general
rules
of
evidence
do
not
necessarily
apply
in
administrative
hearings.
"
had
congress
intended
that
any
courts
could
have
heard
those
cases,
there
would
have
been
no
reason
for
him
to
state
that
his
bill
would
require
the
cases
to
be
heard
in
federal
district
courts
as
opposed
to
simply
courts.
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
i
agree
that
the
mere
grant
of
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
courts
is
not
sufficient.
but
congress
went
beyond
that
mere
grant
of
jurisdiction
through
these
types
of
pronouncements
by
stating,
for
example,
as
speaker
albert
said
characterizing
representative
erlenborn's
position,
that
the
protection
of
the
principles
of
justice
require
that
these
cases
be
heard
only
in
the
federal
courts.
he
could
have
said
only
in
the
courts
as
opposed
to
administrative
agencies.
representative
mccollouch
discussing
the
injunction
power
stated
that
the
erlenborn
substitute
would
allow
only
as
federal
court
to
issue
such
an
injunction.
on
the
senate
side,
you
have
the
same
sort
of
considerations.
when
senator
dominick
repeatedly
offered
his
court
enforcement
amendment,
he
repeatedly
referred
to
the
district
courts
where,
under
the
dominick
amendment,
suits
would
have
to
be
filed.
he
stated
on
the
second
consideration
of
the
dominick
amendment
that
his
amendment
would
"vest
adjudicatory
power
where
it
belongs
in
impartial
judges
shielded.
"
by...
shielded
"from
political
winds
by
life
tenure.
"
that
does
not
apply
to
the
state
court
judicial
system.
and
specifically
he
stated
that
we
would
be
distributing
the
power
to
enforce
this
law
to
93
district
courts
with
398
district
judges.
i
submit
that's
about
as
precise
as
you
can
expect
someone
to
be
that
the
intention
was
that
these
cases
be
brought
in
the
federal
district
courts.
you
couple
those
legislative
assertions
with
the
carefully
ordered
sequential
procedure
that
i
referred
to
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question
and
it
would
be
inconceivable
to
think
that
the
sponsors
of
this
legislation
who
had
agreed
to
the
compromise,
were
presuming
that
state
courts
had
any
role
in
the
enforcement.
this
is
reinforced
by
several
procedural
mechanisms
which
congress
built
into
the
statute
which
have
application
only
in
the
federal
courts.
and
as
this
court
suggests
in
its
taflin
decision,
the
inclusion
of
such
provisions
is
a
suggestion
that
congress
did
intend
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction.
start,
for
example,
with
the
provisions
of
section
706(j)
which
provide
that
any
civil
action
under
this
section
shall
be
subject
to
appeal
as
provided
in
sections
1291
and
1292
of
title
28.
now,
that
provision
applies
only
to
the
cases
that
can
be
taken
to
the
federal
courts
of
appeals,
and
those
are
only
cases
which
arise
out
of
the
federal
district
courts
or
thorough
the
administrative
agencies.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
in
which
congress
has
specified
specific
reference
to
sections
1291
and
1292
which
involve
concurrent
jurisdiction.
the
seventh
circuit
characterized
that
as
merely
a
grant
of
jurisdiction.
if
that
were
so,
it
would
be
an
unnecessary
statement
by
congress.
and
further,
sections
1291
and
1292
carry
some
important
baggage
with
them
over
what
constitutes
an
appealable
order.
that
might
be
very
different
under
state
court
systems
under
which
a
number
of
orders
which
would
be
characterized
as
interlocutory
and
not
appealable
by
this
court
could
be
appealed
directly
in
a
state
court
system,
thereby
staying
proceedings
and
thereby
interfering
with
the
congressional
goal
of
seeking
the
rapid
adjudication
of
these
cases.
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
if
it
had
not
included
the
reference
to
1291
and
1292,
that
would
be
some
indication
that
the...
well,
reverse
that.
if
congress
had
said
nothing
in
the
legislative
discussion,
if
the
sequential
procedure
were
not
present
and
if
the
procedural
mechanisms
which
are
unique
to
the
federal
system
were
not
present,
we
wouldn't
be
here
because
there
would
be
no
basis
to
argue
that
the
gulf
offshore
standards
have
been
met.
but
by
including
the
reference
to
1291
and
1292,
we
submit
that
that's
a
strong
indication
that
congress
intended
these
cases
to
be
brought
only
in
the
federal
courts
because
you
would
not
have
cases
appealed
from
the
state
court
system
to
the
federal
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
it's
an
unusual
procedure
by
congress
to
specify
that
the
appeal
is
to
be
taken
pursuant
to
sections
1291
and
1292.
i'm
only
aware
of
a
few
instances
in
which
congress
has
ever
done
that,
and
all
of
those
statutes
are
ones
in
which
congress
has
at
the
same
time
set
forth
that
the
jurisdiction
is
to
be
exclusively
federal.
for
example,
you
have
that
in
the
natural
gas
act,
you
have
that
in
the
federal
power
act
and
in
the
connelly
hot
oil
act.
i
believe
those
are
the
only
examples
i
could
find
in
which,
other
than
title
vii,
the
congress
has
specified
the
1291
and
1292
procedure.
in
addition,
you
have
the
federal
interest
in
uniformity
which
might
be
compromised
here
because
of
the
possible
litigation
of
these
claims
in
the
state
courts.
congress
was
clear
to
spell
out
that
the
injunctive
relief
would
be
issued
pursuant
to
rule
65.
rule
65
contains
with
it
specified
procedures
which
protect
the
interests
of
the
respondents
as
well
as
the
persons
claiming
to
be
aggrieved
and
there
may
not
be
an
analog
in
the
state
court
system
for
the
grant
of
injunctive
relief.
therefore,
you
could
have
a
system
under
which
restraining
orders
would
be
granted
or
denied
and
the
result
would
depend
not
on
the
case
but
simply
upon
which
the
court
the...
the
action
had
been
brought.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
legislative
history
whatsoever
to
suggest
that
congress
was
attempting
to
regulate
the
procedures
of
the
state
courts
when
it
included
these
provisions
in
the
statute.
similarly,
there
are
provisions
of
the
statute
dealing
with
the
time
table
of
the
cases,
the
assignment
to
individual
judges,
the
expedition
of
proceedings,
the
use
of
magistrates
pursuant
to
rule
53,
under
which
congress
carefully
prescribed
certain
procedures
to
apply.
now,
those
procedures
were
part
of
the
compromise
that
congress
settled
on.
a
number
of
those
procedures
came
in
with
the
final
consideration
of
the
dominick
amendment
where
senator
dominick
stated,
"despite
voluminous
rhetoric
to
the
contrary,
my
convictions
that
u.s.
district
court
enforcement
provides
employees
and
potential
employees
with
the
fairest,
most
effective
redress
of
their
grievances
remains
unshaken.
"
the
biggest
argument
against
court
enforcement
at
the
time
was
the
delay,
and
senator
dominick
sought
to
remedy
that
and
to
assuage
the
opponents
of
the
court
enforcement
system
by
incorporating
the
procedural
provisions,
such
as
assigning
the
case
to
an
individual
district
court
judge
for
an
expedited
hearing.
now,
the
compromise
between
the
proponents
of
the
court
enforcement
and
the
cease
and
desist
models
is
an
essential
part
of
this
legislation.
if
you
say,
as
the
seventh
circuit
did,
that
these
provisions
simply
do
not
apply
if
the
case
is
brought
in
a
state
court,
then
you
in
effect
remove
the
compromises
that
congress
specifically
built
into
the
statute.
your
honor,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
first,
with
regard
to
taflin,
this
court
recognized
that
congress
could
proceed,
assuming
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction.
and
given
the
start
with
the
nlrb
model
and
then
the
move
to
the
trial
court
litigation
model
without
any
mention
of
the
state
courts,
we
submit
it
shows
just
that
assumption.
the
involvement
of
the
states
that
mr.
henely
talked
about
was
specifically
worked
out
by
the
reference
to
state
agencies,
but
it
was
under
state
law
where
the
states
were
to
have
any
role.
in
section
706(c)
congress
specifically
talks
about
resort
to
the
states,
the
initially
instituting
a
proceeding
with
the
state
or
local
agency
under
state
law,
not
under
federal
law.
where
congress
wanted
the
states
to
be
involved
with
this
statute,
which
touched
so
deeply
on
issues
of
state
rights
versus
federal
rights,
it
knew
how
to
provide
for
it.
you...
you
asked
the
question,
your
honors,
about
whether
or
not
the
united
states
had
ever
taken
a
position
on
this
issue,
and
indeed
it
has,
before
this
court.
in
united
states
v.
minnick,
the
solicitor
general
filed
a
brief
with
this
court
in
1981
arguing
in
favor
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
federal
courts
to
hear
title
vii
claims.
finally,
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
preclusion,
i'm
surprised
that
a
plaintiff
would
be
in
favor
of
having
concurrent
jurisdiction
because
it
is
a
nearly
universal
rule,
as
justice
kennedy
noted
in
his
eichman
case
on
the
ninth
circuit,
a
nearly
universal
principle
that
preclusion
will
apply
only
if
the
first
court
rendering
the
decision
had
jurisdiction
over
the
second
claim.
so
that
if
you
have
concurrent
jurisdiction,
a
plaintiff
could
indeed
be
claim-precluded,
having
litigated
in
the
state
court.
if
you
have
a--
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
--yes,
she
did.
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
the
determination
will
then
of
course
be
made
as
a
basis
of
state
law,
what...
what
preclusion
the
state
would
provide.
and
congress
was
careful
here
and
concerned
that,
because
of
its
distrust
of
the
states
in
this
area
that
the
reference
to
the
states
was
through
the
administrative
procedure
and
was
for
a
very
narrow
period
of
time.
and
i
would
submit
that--
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
--that's
correct.
yes.
and
where
there
is
that
exclusive
jurisdiction,
then
the
plaintiff
will
not
be
claim
precluded.
now,
the
plaintiff
could
still
be
issue
precluded,
as
this
court
held
in
kremer.
the
result
of
that
case
was
no
discrimination
and...
and
the
court
was...
was
required
to
dismiss
based
upon
the
new
york
state
proceedings
affirmed
by
a
state
court.
but
if...
if
there
is
a
concurrent
jurisdiction,
then
the
plaintiffs
presumably
would
be
precluded
more.
finally,
your
honors,
with
respect
to
that
issue,
there
will
be
parallel
litigation
and
there
will
be
parallel
litigation
whether
you
choose
to
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
or
exclusively
federal
jurisdiction
because
at
the
state
level
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
states...
i
believe
all
except
three...
have
adopted
statutes
which
contain
discrimination
provisions
and
discrimination
remedies.
the
overwhelming
majority
of
those
states
provide
for
jurisdiction
through
a
cease
and
desist
type
administrative
agency
similar
to
the
national
labor
relations
board.
so,
if
you
say
that
plaintiffs
can
bring
their
claims
in
state
courts,
there
can
then
be
a
title
vii
claim
proceeding
in
the
state
court
and
a
parallel
proceeding
under
the
state
administrative
law,
where
the
state
administrative
agency
has
no
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
title
vii
claim.
the
advantage,
consistent
with
the
congressional
intent
of
providing
for
exclusive
jurisdiction,
is
that
the
states
can
serve
federalism's
interests
by
trying
to
resolve
the
discrimination
complaints
under
state
law
and
the
federal
claims
can
be
heard
in
federal
court
where,
under
the
dominick
amendment,
the
claims
were
required
to
be
heard.
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
well,
the
valenzuela
case
drew
also
upon
the
statutory
provisions
calling
for
the
expedited
proceedings,
the
assignment
of
a
single
judge,
the
application
of
rule
65
standards,
appeals
to
be
handled
under
section
1291
and
1292.
those
are
explicitly
dealt
with
in
the
valenzuela
opinion.
the
other
courts
of
appeals--
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
--well,
they--
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
--they
were,
i
would
submit,
both
incompatible
with
state
jurisdiction
and
evidence
of
the
congressional
intent
because
you
are
then
left
with
the
position
of
whether
or
not
to
force
the
states
to
realign
their
court
administration
system
to
accommodate
the
procedures
that
were
an
essential
part
of
the
compromise
that
congress
reached.
the
general
principle
has
always
been
that
while
states
are
required
to
provide
a
forum
for
federal
rights,
the
state
courts
can
arrange
their
court
systems
and
their
judicial
administration
as
they
see
fit.
mr.
jeffrey
ivan
pasek
i
believe
that
it
would,
yes.
now,
you
would
also
have
incompatibility
in
the
sense
that
you
have,
for
example,
under
the
national
labor
relations
act,
where
it
would
be
incompatible
to
allow
a
state
court
to
hear
a
claim
which
even
the
federal
district
courts
were
not
able
to
hear.
thank
you.
