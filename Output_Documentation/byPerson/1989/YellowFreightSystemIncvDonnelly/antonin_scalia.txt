justice
scalia
or
with
the
federal
judiciary?
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--it
depends
on
how
you

judiciary
as

was
in
the
context
of
a
discussion
of
whether
there
would
be
enforcement
in
the

or

the
federal

that
the
context
in

think
the
ultimate
determination
should
be
made
by
the
federal
judiciary,
not
by
the
administrative
agency.
so
it
really
doesn't
say
much
