justice
o'connor
--well,
mr.
pasek,
it's
true
that
the
legislative
history
contains
many
references
to
the
supposed
federal
court
jurisdiction,
but
does
it
contain
anywhere
a
discussion
of
the
possible
role
of
state
courts?
justice
o'connor
so
it's
a
little
hard
to
say
that
it
meets
the
gulfshore...
gulf
offshore
requirement
that
there
be
an
unmistakable
implication
of
federal
jurisdiction
exclusively.
justice
o'connor
well,
but
the
thrust
of
gulf
offshore's
comments
was
that
it
has
to
be
an
unmistakable
implication,
and
it
looks
to
me
like
that's
hard
to
make
out
here.
true,
there's
lots
of
discussion
of
federal
court
involvement
but
just
nothing
to
say
unmistakably
that
state
court
jurisdiction
is
precluded.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
henely,
a
good
many
federal
courts
have
held
that
the
federal
courts
do
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
these
cases.
justice
o'connor
there
is
language
to
that
effect
in
dicta
and
opinions
of
this
court.
now,
are
all
those
courts
and
all
those
statements
just
wrong?
justice
o'connor
did
they
misread
the
legislative
history
or--
justice
o'connor
well,
why
would
congress
have
provided
for
expedited
procedures
in
these
cases
in
federal
courts
and
other
provisions
that
apply
specifically
to
these
claims
in
federal
courts
if
they
intended
state
court
jurisdiction
to
be
concurrent?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
a
good
many
state
courts
have
long
delays,
don't
they?
justice
o'connor
and
so
if
jurisdiction
were
to
lie
there
would
congress
have
intended,
do
you
think,
that
the
cases
be
heard
there?
