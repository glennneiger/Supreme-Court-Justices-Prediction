mr.
nicholas
spaeth
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
members
of
the
court,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
a
special
privilege
for
me
to
be
here
because
it
is
only
two
ways
shy
of
the
state
of
north
dakota's
hundredth
birthday.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state,
in
an
effort
to
prevent
bootlegging
of
liquor
from
military
enclaves,
may
impose
a
requirement
on
the
suppliers
of
that
liquor
to
the
bases
that
requires
them
to
put
a
label
on
each
bottle
destined
for
the
military
enclave
indicating
it
is
to
be
consumed
only
on
the
base.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
if
you
buy
it
from
a
local
distributor,
that
is
correct.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
correct,
and
pay
the
tax.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
we
don't
have
a
bootlegging
problem
with
that,
because
there
isn't
a
price
differential.
and
that
is
in
fact--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--that
is
correct.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
correct.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
correct.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
correct,
because
the
taxes
have
been
paid.
and--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--to
prevent
bootlegging
of
the
liquor
off
the
base.
there
is
a
price
differential
between
liquor
sold
on
the
base
and
off
the
base,
because
off-the-base
liquor
sales
are
subject
to
the
distribution
system
and
the
state
taxation.
on-base
sales
are
not.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
well,
if
i
can
confine
myself
to
answer
your
question,
first
of
all,
solely
to
the
record.
in
north
dakota
the
state
treasury
became
aware
of
liquor
being
shipped
off
base
and
used
by
people
off
the
premises
and
being
distributed
to
other
individuals
who
are
not
authorized
to
have
it.
in
the
state
of
hawaii
one
enterprising
person
managed
to
get
enough
liquor
off
the
base
to
actually
supply
a
complete
liquor
store
within
hawaii.
in
the
state
of
washington,
enough
liquor
was
shipped
to
one
particular
military
enclave
where,
if
it
were
to
be
consumed
on
base,
each
individual
would
have
had
to
consume
five
bottles
per
day,
every
day
of
the
year.
and
anyone
who
has
ever
been
around--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--well,
anybody
who
has
been
around
military
bases
knows
that
there
is
a
little
bit
of
drinking
that
goes
on,
but
i
think
that
is
more
than...
than
its
share.
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
regulation
is
designed
to
do.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
no,
it
does
not.
there
is,
however,
of
course,
a
chronological
link
because
once
the
labeling
requirement
went
into
effect,
several
suppliers
indicated
that
they
would
prefer
to
supply
through
the
regular
distribution
system.
others
said
that
they
would
go
ahead
and
supply
it
anyway,
and
others
said
we
are
going
to
supply
it,
but
it
is
going
to
cost
you
more.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
would
be
certainly
more
problematical
then,
because
that
would
be
an
effort
to
directly
regulate
within
the
military
enclave,
and
prior
cases
of
this
court
have
not
allowed
states
that
kind
of
discretion.
although
this
is
a
special
case
in
the
sense
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
interacts
in
this
particular
situation.
so
although
the
court
hasn't
tread
on
that
ground
before,
it
would
be
a,
certainly
a
more
difficult
case
for
me
were
i
to
argue
that.
i
brought
some
labels
with
me
so
that
the
court
could
see
what
they
are.
these
are
16
labels.
they
are
crack-and-peel
kind
of
labels,
like
bumper
stickers.
peel
them
off
and
then
you
affix
them
to
the
bottle
like
that.
they
cost
about
three
cents
or
five
cents,
in
that
range,
to
produce.
the
state
generates
no
revenue
from
them--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--no,
you
can't.
i
don't
know--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--my
apologies
to
the
marshal.
i
don't
think
i
can.
[laughter]
but
if
there
is
anybody
who
has
ever
participated
in
a
political
campaign
knows,
as
i
have,
the
worst...
the
hardest
thing
to
get
people
to
put
on,
or
to
identify
with
you,
is
a
bumper
sticker,
because
it
is
very
difficult
to
get
off.
and
the
same
thing
here.
you
can't
tear
it
off
without
leaving
at
least
part
of
it
on.
and
that
is
why
this
particular
kind
of
label
was
chosen
for
this
purpose.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
no.
excuse
me,
yes,
i
do
take
the
position
it
is
not
a
burdensome
requirement.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
well,
that
wouldn't
help
us
with
respect
to
identifying
liquor
that
is
sold
on
the
base
versus
liquor
that
might
be
brought
in
from
minnesota.
in
other
words,
it
is
possible,
in
a
border
state
like
north
dakota,
that
liquor
could
wind
up
in
the
state
that
was
purchased
in
minnesota.
and
while
the
position
you...
offer
just
has
some
merit,
it
wouldn't
enable
us
to
distinguish
liquor
brought
in
from
minnesota
or
montana
or
south
dakota
from
liquor
that
was
brought
off
the
bases,
where
tax
was
not
collected.
so,
i
don't
think
approaching
it
the
reverse
way
would
help
us.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
it
is
not
a
problem
because
the
prices
are
roughly
equivalent,
because
again
they
go
through
their
regular
state
distribution
system
and
taxes
are
collected
on
that
liquor.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
i
am
sorry,
justice
stevens.
i
don't
quite
understand
your
question,
but
i'll
try
to
answer
it.
there
is
a
substantial
price
difference
between
liquor
sold
on
the
bases
in
north
dakota--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--and
liquor
sold
in
north
dakota,
in
minnesota,
in
montana
and
in
south
dakota.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
correct.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
right.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
the
difficulty
we
have,
though,
is
one
of
the
two
military
enclaves
we
are
talking
about
here
is
located
in
grand
forks,
north
dakota,
and
i
am
not...
i
don't
know
your
familiarity
with
north
dakota
geography,
but
that
sits
squarely
on
the
border
with
minnesota.
and
we
would
have
liquor
in
north
dakota
from
minnesota,
and
we'd
have
lots
of
it,
because
of
sales
or
whatever
features
that
may
cause
people
to
purchase
across
the...
the
border.
so
there
still
is
a
bootlegging
problem
that
is
dealt
with
by
using
these
labels.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
no,
there
are
not.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
only
the
federal
tax
stamp
exists
on
both
north
dakota
and
minnesota
liquor.
and
so
we
do
have
an
identification
problem.
in
any
event,
if
you
look
at
it
simply
from
the
standpoint
of
practicalities,
this
is
probably
the
least
intrusive
thing
the
state
of
north
dakota
could
have
done
to
deal
with
what
it
perceived
to
be
a
major
problem.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
i
think
it
is
a
rather
extravagant
estimate.
i
mean,
the
labels
themselves
only
cost
a
couple
of
pennies
each.
and
unless
their
labor
costs
are
enormous,
it
is
hard
to
believe
it
would
cost
that
much
money
to
affix
these
labels.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
correct.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
right,
although
both
sides
stipulated
to
most
of
the
essential
facts
in
this
case.
so
it...
it's
really
not
a
case
where
there
is
a
real
quibble
over
the
factual
record.
it
is
rather
the
inferences
to
be
drawn
from
the
factual
record.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
correct.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
and,
it
could
be,
in
some
sense
of
the
word,
because
obviously
the
federal
government
is
arguing
that
it
is
extremely
burdensome
to
comply
with
this
requirement,
and
the
state
is
arguing
to
the
contrary.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that's
correct.
it
could
account
for
some
of
that
cost
to
go,
again--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--unless
the
states
got
together
and
agreed
on
a
sample
labeling
procedure,
that
is
correct.
the
state
doesn't
attempt,
of
course,
to
regulate
sales
on
the
base
in
any
other
way.
none
of
this
liquor
is
taxed.
the
bases
operate
at
different
hours
than
liquor
stores
within
the
state,
and
sell
to
any
classes,
individuals,
it
wants
to
on
the
base,
and
at
different
ages.
you
can
buy
liquor
on
the
air
force
bases
in
north
dakota
when
you
are
18.
you
have
to
wait
until
you
are
21
within
the
state.
the
state
believed
it
had
the
authority
to
impose
this
labeling
requirement
because
of
its
inherent
police
powers,
and
also
because
of
its
core
powers
within
the
twenty-first
amendment.
indeed
we
thought
in
doing
this
we
were
doing
exactly
what
this
court
suggested
that
we
do
in
united
states
v.
mississippi
tax
commission,
when
the
court
alluded
to
the
fact
that
the
states
were
free,
of
course,
to
regulate
the
shipments
of
liquor
en
route
to
bases
in
order
to
prevent
diversion.
but
notwithstanding
what
we
thought
to
be
a
fairly
innocuous
regulation,
and
our
belief
that
it
was
firmly
rooted
in
prior
cases
of
this
court,
the
federal
government
chose
to
challenge
it.
and
as
the
court
has
already
noted,
the
eighth
circuit
overturned
the
regulations
on
a
two
to
one
vote.
the
court
of
appeals
found
the
regulation
invalid,
i
believe,
because
it
mischaracterized
it.
it
saw
the
regulation
as
a
direct
effort
to
regulate
sales
of
liquor
on
the
base,
and
that
is
clearly
not
the
case.
the
regulation
only
applies
to
the
suppliers.
it
is
really
like
a
host
of
other
state
regulations
that
indirectly
affect
federal
procurement:
safety
regulations,
minimum
wage
regulations,
environmental
regulations,
even
the
highway
speed
limit.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
right.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
correct.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
right,
because
the
tax
will
be--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--that
assumes
that
they
are
going
to
go
through
the
distribution
network,
and
many
of
the
stores--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--that
is
correct.
but
of
course,
they
are
free
to
label
it
and
the
air
force
is
free
to
buy,
of
course,
from
whomever
it
wants.
there
is
no
requirement
for
the
air
force
purchase
through
the
distribution
system.
and
many
suppliers
will
supply
the
liquor
with
the
sticker
on
it,
and
that...
the
record
does
show
that.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
correct.
but
that
is
because--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--well,
it
is
a
difference,
but
it
is
a
discrimination
in
favor
of
the
federal
government,
because
every
other
distributor
has
to
pay
the
tax
and
go
through
the
whole
distribution
network,
be
licensed
and
be
bonded.
it
is
exactly
like
the
situation
this
court
endorsed
in
united
states
v.
washington,
where
the
state
of
washington
imposed
a
tax
on
federal
contractors
that
was
different
than
the
tax
imposed
on
other
contractors
within
the
state.
the
tax
was
lower.
and
this
court
said
there
was
no
problem
with
that.
that
is
constitutional
because
you
are
not
discriminating
against
the
federal
government.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
because
it
doesn't
require...
we
are
not
attempting
to
tax
the
distributor
or
the
supplier
or
purveyor
of
liquor
to
the
base.
the
tax
isn't
collected;
the
suppliers
don't
have
to
go
through
the
state
distribution
system.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
they
just
have
to
label.
it
is
far
less
onerous
than
what
other
distributors
have
to
do
within
the
state.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
go
which
route?
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
i
don't
think
that
the
state
could
require
the
federal
enclaves
to
buy
it
through
the
distribution
system,
but
i
do
think
the
state,
if
it
wanted
to,
could
tax
those
suppliers
before
they
sell
the
liquor
to
the
base.
indeed,
the
court
in
the
united
states
v.
mississippi
said
the
states
could
do
that,
and
in
the
case
i
just
cited
to
you,
united
states
v.
the
state
of
washington,
the
court
said
you
could
do
that.
you
could
tax
contractors
or
suppliers
to
the
federal
government,
as
long
as
you
don't
do
it
in
a
discriminatory
way.
we
are
doing
far
less
than
that
here--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--well,
they
are
in
state,
though,
for
the
purpose
of
doing
business,
in
the
sense
that
they
are
selling
to
locations
within
the
state.
i
mean,
that,
just
as
sears
and
roebuck
is
in
the
state
in
the
sense
that
it
sells
within
the
state.
and
i
don't
think
it
is
any
different
than
situations
this
court
has
endorsed
in
other
cases.
the
court
of
appeals
also
thought
in
this
case
that
there
might
be
federal
preemption.
it
relied
on
a
statute
that
requires
the
federal
government
to
purchase
liquor
from
the
most
competitive
source,
price
and
other
factors
considered,
and
a
regulation
that
basically
parroted
the
statute.
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
see
how
that
could
be
preemption.
first
of
all,
there
is
no
express
statement
in
either
the
statute
or
regulation
that
any
state
rules
or
regulations
are
preempted.
certainly
this
is
not
an
area
where
congress
has
occupied
the
field,
indeed
the
twenty-first
amendment
would
arguably
prevent
that.
and
third,
there
is
no
frustration
of
the
federal
purchasing
objection
here.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
correct.
that
is
precisely
what
congress
intended.
and,
obviously,
it
is
our
position,
what
the
state
of
north
dakota
does
here
doesn't
interfere
in
any
way
with
what
congress
intended,
because--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--that
is
right.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
right,
and
they
are
free...
the
bases
are
free
to
buy
from
whatever
source
they
want.
and
the
only
thing
that
north
dakota
requires
is
this
little
label
to
be
affixed
to
those
bottles.
so
again,
it
is
difficult
to
see
where
the
preemption
comes
here,
given
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
regulation,
and
i
doubt
very
much
if
that
is
what
congress
intended
to
do
when
it
enacted
this
particular
legislation.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
yes,
justice
blackmun.
i
don't
think
it
applies.
in
paul
we
are
dealing
with
a
situation
where
california
had
a
minimum
price
law
with
respect
to
milk.
and,
obviously,
any
time
you
set
a
minimum
that
tends
to
be
where
the
price
falls,
if
you
understand
the
marketing
in
milk.
and
that
totally
frustrated
the
federal
objective
of
buying
from
the
most
competitive
source
available,
because
every
quart
of
milk
sold
in
california
was
priced
at
exactly
the
same
price.
that's
not
the
situation
here.
we
are
not
attempting
to
fix
the
price
of
liquor
that
is
sold
on
the
base.
all
we
are
doing
is
imposing
a
requirement
that
according
to
the
federal
government
raises
its
cost
of
buying.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
right,
bootlegging
of
liquor
within
the
state.
we
think
what
we
did
here
was
probably
the
least
intrusive
thing
we
could
have
done,
and
the
case
is
important
in
north
dakota,
and
in
other
states
as
you
might
guess
from
the
volume
of
amicus
support
for
the
state.
we
also
felt
we
did
what
the
court
invited
us
to
do
in
prior
cases
dealing
with
this
area.
and,
if
the
state
can't
do
this,
i
am
not
sure
what
we
can
do
to
prevent
bootlegging.
and
it
is
for
that
reason
i
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
before,
below,
and
reinstate
the
regulation--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--being
supplied
to
the
base?
lots.
there
are
very
large
enclaves,
they
have...
there
are
very
large
air
force
bases.
both
have
bombers
and
missiles,
and
there
are
something
like
10,000
people
on
each
base.
in
addition
to
that,
of
course,
there
are
a
host
of
other
people
who
are
eligible
to
buy,
retirees,
dependents.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that's
right.
and
they
do
also
restore,
or
bestow
honorary
privileges
on
others.
i
have
honorary
privileges
at
the
minot
air
force
base,
for
example.
i
can
go
up
there
and
drink,
too.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
it
cuts
both
ways.
if
i
want
to
bootleg
too--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--well,
the
state
of
minnesota's
economy
is
doing
so
much
better
than
ours
these
days
that
i
have
no
sympathy
whatsoever
for
it.
notwithstanding
the
problems
the
vikings
have
been
having
lately.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
yes.
i
think
i
misstated
myself,
justice
scalia.
we
probably
could--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--enforce
some
sort
of
tax,
and
that
would
lessen
the
price
differential
and
help
alleviate
the
bootlegging.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
but
perhaps
not
cure
it
because
the
military
enjoys
a
tremendous
purchasing
advantage
as
well
because
of
the
volumes
it
buys.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
thank
you.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
i
think
the
court
understands
the
case,
but
i
thought
i
would
follow
up
on
a
couple
of
points
that
came
up
and
perhaps
the
court
is
also
in
doubt
about
the
answer.
the
labels,
which
i
showed
to
you
before,
are
fairly
effective
because
of
their
bright
color
in
identifying
someone
who
is
accumulating
large
quantities
of
liquor
for
bootlegging,
and
they
are
subject,
in
that
case,
to--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--no.
if
they
want
to,
if
they
are
going
to
bootleg
it
off
the
base
this
isn't
going
to
help.
and
it
is
not
going
to
help
in
typical
situations
where
someone
takes
one
or
two
bottles
off
the
base.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
it
depends
on...
on
how
we
find
them.
if
we
found
someone
with
simply
one
or
two
bottles,
we'd...
we
would
not
prosecute.
my
office--
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
--there
could
be.
if
we
were
to
prove
that
that
person
took...
intended
then
to
redistribute
it
or
resell
it,
that
would
be
in
violation
of
a
host
of
state
laws
which
impose
criminal
penalties
as
well
as
civil
penalties.
the
criminal
penalty
is
a
class
a
misdemeanor.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
that
is
correct.
we
would
have
to
prove,
of
course,
in
the
case
of
a
single
bottle,
that
they
intended
to
do
that,
and
undoubtedly
we
wouldn't
prosecute
in
that
case.
but
that
is
not
what
we
are
concerned
about.
we
are
concerned
more
with
the
situation
where
its
large
quantities
being
moved
off
base,
and
we
can
identify
them
through
the
use
of
these
labels.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
no,
we
don't
have
a
possession
rule.
but
we
do
have
a
rule,
a
law
that
prohibits
possession
with
intent
to
resell.
and
that
is
what
we're,
that
is
what
our
regulations
are
designed
to
do.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
i
don't
know
if
it
is
substantial,
but
it
is
more
than
three
cents
a
bottle.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
i
don't
know,
i
don't
buy
it
by
the
case,
but
it
could
be
more
burdensome.
[laughter]
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
yes.
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
no,
there
is
no
labeling
requirement.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
some
states
do,
but
many
states
do
not.
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
the
last
point
i
wanted
to
address,
and
then
if
there
are
any
questions
i
will
answer
them,
is
the
dispute
we
are
having
with
the
government
about
whether
we
could
tax
or
not.
and
i
know
the
court
doesn't
like
to
listen
to
quotes,
but
if
you
look
at
your
case
united
states
v.
mississippi
state
tax
commission,
421
u.s.
at
613-614,
the
court
does
say
that
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
leads
to
the
extraordinary
conclusion
that
the
amendment
abolished
federal
immunity
with
respect
to
sales,
but
it
does,
certainly
does
not
say
anything...
excuse
me,
i
am
misreading
it.
there
is
the
ability
to
tax,
and
i
think,
you
know,
that
is
clear
based
on
a
whole
line
of
cases
that
this
court
has
declared.
are
there
any
more
questions?
mr.
nicholas
spaeth
thank
you.
