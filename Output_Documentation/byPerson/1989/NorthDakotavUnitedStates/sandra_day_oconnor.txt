justice
o'connor
well,
what's
the
purpose
of
the
north
dakota
requirement?
justice
o'connor
what
sorts
of
diversions
constitute
the
evil
or
the
problem?
justice
o'connor
does
the
record
show
that
the
labeling
requirement
is
what
caused
the
out
of
state
suppliers
to
stop
supplying
liquor
to
the
government?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
you
could
require
the
federal
government
to
affix
the
labels?
justice
o'connor
could
the
state
impose
a
general
sales
or
use
tax
on
these
sales?
