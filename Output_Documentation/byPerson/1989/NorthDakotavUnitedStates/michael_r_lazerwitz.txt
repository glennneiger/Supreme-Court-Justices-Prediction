mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
military's
procurement
of
alcoholic
beverages
has
generated
its
share
of
controversy
ever
since
the
congress,
in
1802,
included
one
gill,
which
is
four
ounces,
of
rum,
whiskey
or
brandy
in
a
soldier's
daily
ration.
before
this
court
today
the
issue
is
whether
the
federal
government,
consistent
with
federal
law,
may
remain
free
to
purchase
its
alcoholic
beverages
for
resale
in
military
base
clubs
and
package
stores
from
the
most
convenient
and
inexpensive
sources,
regardless
of
whether
those
sources
are
located
in
a
base's
home
state.
in
our
view
the
states
regulations
are
constitutionally
invalid
for
three
principal
reasons.
first,
congress
has
made
clear
in
section
2488
of
title
10
that
the
military
must
remain
free
to
buy
its
alcoholic
beverages
at
the
lowest
available
price,
regardless
of
where
the
suppliers
and/or
distillers
are
located.
here
the
record
shows
that
north
dakota's
regulatory
efforts
conflict
with
this
federal
scheme,
actually
thwart
it,
and
thus
violate
the
supremacy
clause.
the
regulations
would
in
effect
require
the
military
to
obtain
its
liquor
for
its
north
dakota
facilities
from
less
competitive
in-state
sources,
and
on
this
record,
at
an
increased
annual
cost
of
more
than
$200,000.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
that
is
clearly
an
issue
of
fact,
and
in
this
case
there
was
an
uncontroverted
affidavit
from
kim
keltz,
that
would
be
found
at
the
joint
appendix
25
to
28,
and
she...
her
affidavit
stated
that
these
regulations
would
in
effect
require
the
government
to
pay
more
money.
and
the
reason
isn't
that
hard
to
find.
she
testified
that--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes.
and
the
reason
isn't...
isn't
that
difficult.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
ms.
keltz's
affidavit,
she
testified
or
explained
that
five
of
our
prime
source
suppliers
said,
in
light
of
these
regulations,
we
are
no
longer
going
to
sell
directly
to
you.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no,
we
don't.
the
record
doesn't
say
that.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court,
in
the
liquor
business,
with
both
liquor
that
is
manufactured,
distilled,
in
this
country
and
out
of
the
country,
there
are
exclusive
distributors.
you
can
only
buy,
for
example--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--the
only
record
support,
or
the
record
that
bears
on
this
aspect,
is
in
the
kim
keltz
affidavit,
and
that
is
not
contradicted.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
the
affidavit
further
states...
no,
it
doesn't,
that
is
clear.
but
the
affidavit
further
states
that
because
of
these
prime
source
suppliers
would
no
longer
sell
us
liquor,
we
would
have
to
buy
those
supplies
from
the
in-state
sources,
the
distributors.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
in
that
respect,
if
in
fact
every
state
in
the
country
had
one
of
these...
had
a
labeling
requirement,
yes.
we
would
have
a
much
different
case.
but
there
is
a
second
aspect
to
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
whether
the
government
would
want
to.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
the
government--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--the
government,
at
least
in
the
liquor
field,
the
government...
there
are
only
certain
entities
that
sell
particular
brands.
that's
the
problem
here,
one
of
the
problems.
but
there
is
a
second
aspect--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
the
whole
point
of
these
enterprises
on
military
bases,
they
are
twofold.
one
is
to
provide
a
service
to
the
servicemen.
and
another...
and
in
providing
a
service
you
have
to
provide
those
products
that
the
consumers
demand.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
there
is
a
second
aspect
to
this
case
that's
equally
important
in
terms
of
its
constitutional
invalidity.
and
that
is,
look
at
the
regulations
themselves.
the
state
tells
you
it
cannot
regulate
the
military's
procurement
practices,
but
that
is
precisely
what
it
is
regulations
seek
to
accomplish.
and
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
state
is
not
at
liberty
to
take
that
step.
and
the
final
problem
with
these
regulations
is
that
since
the
state
is
otherwise
engaging
in
regulation
over
the
military's
procurement
practices,
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
those
circumstances,
doesn't
save
the
state's
regulations
from
constitutional
invalidity.
at
the
outset,
justice
scalia
mentioned
before,
well,
what
can
a
state
do
if
there
is
this
problem.
seven
states
in
this
country
actually
use
the
most
efficient
method,
which
is
a
tax
stamp
system.
the
state
could
require
all
licensed
wholesalers
in
the
state
to
affix
tax
stamps,
which
would
actually
be
seals
on
the
bottle,
on
every
bottle
of
liquor
that
they
sell.
the
state
could
then
readily
determine
whether
any
retailer,
or
any
other
person
for
that
matter,
were
selling
untaxed
liquor.
and
in
that
respect,
the
states
that
do
that...
minnesota
in
fact
doesn't
do
that
if
that
is
at
all
relevant,
but
in
that
respect
there
would
be
no
burden
on
the
federal
government
whatsoever,
and
how
the
federal
government
went
about
buying
its
liquor
wouldn't
affect
the
efficiency
of
that
system.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
he
says
that,
we
don't
know.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
the...
there
is
no
doubt
that
because
this
case
was
decided
on
cross
motions
for
summary
judgment
the
record
is
quite
minimal.
but
we
have...
there
is
more
here
than
just--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--there
are
allegations--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--that
is
true.
and
there
is
another
aspect
to
this
case.
in
terms
of
the
diversion
of
liquor,
and
the
government
again,
because
of
the
limited
record,
will
assume
that
there
is
a
problem.
and
the
problem
is,
as
mr.
spaeth
said,
bootlegging,
the
sale...
the
resale
of
untaxed
liquor.
assuming
that's
a
problem,
liquor
on
military
bases,
whether
it
is
bought
from
out-of-state
sources
or
whether
bought
from
licensed
wholesalers
in
the
state,
will
always
be
cheaper
from
liquor
off
the
base
in
north
dakota.
and
that
is
not
only
because
of
the
source,
but
because
liquor
sold
to
the
servicemen
on
the
base
is
not
subject
to
a
retail
tax.
therefore,
under
the
state's
own
terms,
there
is
always
going
to
be
the
potential...
potential
for
diversion,
of
bootlegging,
from
the
liquor
on
the
base.
but
what
happens
here,
the
state
doesn't
impose
any
labeling
requirement
for
liquor
sold
from
the
local
wholesalers.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
not
that
i
know
of,
although
the
military,
the
department
of
defense,
has
a
specific
regulation
telling
the
servicemen
that
you
cannot...
we
will
sell
you
the
liquor
on
the
base,
but
if
you
take
it
off
the
base
you
are
subject
to
state
law.
and
they
are
certainly
told
and
it's
enforced,
not
to
resell
this
to
unauthorized
personnel.
you
and
your
wife
can
have
a
drink,
but
you
can't
sell
it
to
your
buddy
off
the
base,
or
to
anyone
else.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
oh,
of
course
not.
we
could
easily
do
it,
but
there,
but
the
state
can't
tell
us
to
do
it.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
and
the
state
has
told
us
in
its
brief
that
it
can't
tell
us
to
do
it.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
actually,
no.
in
this
case
we
couldn't,
because
the
state
regulation,
as
explained
to
the
distillers,
requires
them
to
put
the
label
on
before
it
comes
into
the
state.
and
that
is
what
scared
off
the
distillers
and
the
suppliers.
if
in
fact
the
regulation
were
any
liquor...
i
mean,
the
problem
with
the
state,
the
state's
difficulty
is,
if
they
want
us
to
put
the
label
on
once
it
gets
into
the
state,
they
can't
tell
us
to
do
that.
and
it
also
won't
accomplish
what
in
fact
is
going
on
here,
which
is
to
change
the
way
the
military
buys
its
liquor.
and
that's...
that
is
our
second
point.
it
is
not
simply
the
problem
with
the
increased
cost.
what
the
state
is
doing
here
is
the
paul
case,
is
the
leslie
miller
case,
is
the
public
utilities
commission
case.
it
doesn't
matter
that
the
regulation
by
its
terms
doesn't
apply
directly
to
us.
in
fact,
this
regulation
is
even
worse
than
the
regulations
at
issue
in
those
cases
because
those
cases,
in
leslie
miller,
paul,
and
the
public
utilities
commission
cases,
those
were
general
regulations
that
applied
to
anyone,
any
firm.
and
there,
those
firms
got
caught
up
in
the
net
because
they
did
business
with
the
government.
this
regulation,
on
its
face,
tells
us
who
it
is
seeking
to
regulate.
it
is
seeking
to
regulate
the
transaction
between
the
federal
government
and
its
suppliers.
it
is
limited
just
to
the
people
that
do
business
with
us.
so,
a
fortiori
it
is
even
more
suspect
in
terms
of
those
cases.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
they
could
not.
that
is
the
mississippi
case,
the
mississippi
cases.
and
so
i
disagree
with
mr.
spaeth
when
he
suggests
that
he...
they
could
readily
do
this
another
way.
if
they...
if
the
state
wants
to
increase
local
tax
revenue
they
cannot
do
that
at
the
expense
of
the
government's
procurement
of
liquor.
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
held
in
the
two
mississippi
tax
cases.
what...
my
point
at
the
beginning
with
the
problem,
we...
this
case
is
not
about
the
united
states
trying
to
disable
north
dakota
or
any
other
state
from
policing
a
legitimate
problem.
but
there
are
ways
to
do
it
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
interfering
with
what
states
can't
do,
and
that
is
regulate
military
procurement.
in
terms
of
the
dollars,
the
practical
effects
are
we
wouldn't
bring
lawsuits
if
the
dollars
didn't
matter.
but
here
the
legislative
record,
and
i
mentioned
before
title...
section
2488,
congress
considered
all
these...
this
precise
matter.
congress
has
told
the
military,
look,
we
want
you
to
buy
beer
and
wine
for
the
bases
only
from
in-state.
but
when
it
comes
to
liquor,
we
want
you
to
buy
it
from
wherever
you
can
get
it
at
the
cheapest
to
save
money.
and
we
need
the
money
because
congress
doesn't
fund
what
the
profits
of
these
sales
go
for.
and
it
is
things
like
child
care
centers,
libraries,
photo
labs,
bowling
alleys,
the
things
on
the
military
bases
that
are
for
the
servicemen's
benefit.
and
so
this
is
important
in
that
respect.
this
money
is
important.
going
back
to
the
suggestion
that
is
made
in
the
brief,
and
it
was
mentioned
here,
that
perhaps
the
military
can
just
absorb
the
cost;
we
could
just
raise
our
prices
if
it
costs
us
more
to
buy
liquor.
in
fact,
there
is
a
department
of
defense
regulation
in
deference
to
states
and
local...
and
other
local
liquor
sale...
entities,
we
will
not
sell
liquor
below
10
percent
of
the
shelf
price
in
any
local
market.
so,
the
military
works
with
an
effective
10
percent
profit
margin.
obviously
we
can't
sell
above
the
local
price,
one,
because
it
makes
no
economic
sense
and,
two,
the
entity
that
runs
these
shops
now,
the
army
and
air
force
exchange
service,
by
regulation,
its
mission
is
to
provide
cheaper
goods
to
servicemen.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
oh,
i
don't
want
to
downplay
the
competitive
advantages
of
military
procurement,
but
i
just
don't
want
to
leave
the
court
with
the
impression
that
we
had
a
simple
option
of
just
raising
prices.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
the
military
got
very
smart.
it
used
to
buy
liquor,
a
lot
of
liquor,
in-state
from
the
distributors
and
paid
the
additional
mark
up
that
is
the
result
of
the
local
tax.
well,
the
military
became
smarter,
and
said
look,
if
we
can
buy
this
in
bulk
quantities
we
are
going
to
save
a
lot
of
money,
and
that
is
what
the
military
does.
and
it
saves
a
lot
of
money.
and
regulations
like
this,
that
effectively
take
out
certain
source
suppliers
of
a
market,
affects
us.
and
it
ruins
the
way
we
do
our
business.
and
that
is
the
problem.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
no,
we
don't,
justice
stevens,
and
there
are
some
practical
concerns.
one
is,
we
have
rules,
and
we
don't
want...
and
military
bases
are
in
communities
and
in
states,
and
the
last
thing
the
military
wants
is
for
state
governments
to
yell
and
complain
that
the
military
is
running
a
bootleg
operation,
because
that
is
going
to
affect
how
it
does
its
business.
it
makes...
it's
no...
it
doesn't
make
any
business
sense--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
the--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
the
example
in
hawaii
was,
i
believe
it
is
hawaii,
it
is
so
silly,
but
the
money,
the
liquor
was
stolen
from
the
military.
i
mean,
there
are
instances
where
people,
the
truckers,
stop
off
at
a
highway
before
getting
to
the
base
and
sell
the
liquor.
now
that
is,
we
don't
like
that
either.
that
is
something
we
call
in
the
fbi
about.
there
is
no
doubt
that
there
is
always
going
to
be
the
chance
of
someone
buying
liquor
on
the
base
for
$9,
and
it
sells
in
the
local
store
for
$11,
becoming
an
enterprising
serviceman
and
sell
it
to
his
buddy
for
$10.
that
is,
that
is
always
going
happen.
and
what
we
do,
and
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
suggested,
and
i
think
there
is
a
lot
of
sense
to
it,
he
said
instead
of
litigating
these
things,
and
instead
of
thinking
up
ways
to
try
to
travel
through
the
cases
and
spend
all
these
years
litigating,
why
don't
we
just
cooperate.
and
there
are
ways
to
cooperate
without
litigating
something
like
this.
and
the
fact
that
the
military,
by
its
regulations,
says
look,
we
will
cooperate
with
state
authorities.
we
don't
want
bootlegging;
it
is
not
in
our
interest.
we...
and
there
are
also
other
things
the
military
can
do.
if,
in
fact,
someone
is
known
to
be
a
bootlegger...
that's
sort
of
an
odd
word,
but
his
privileges
can
be
lifted.
he
can
certainly
be
punished
by
the
military
if
he
is
a
serviceman
if
he
is
breaking--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
i
think
the
way
the
regulations
are
set
up,
they
don't,
they
could
care
less.
because
in
fact--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
i--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
one
curious
aspect
of
this
case,
and
i
am
not
sure
it's
my
province
to
get
into,
but
the
only,
if
you
read
north
dakota's
laws,
there
is
no
law
that
says
it's
illegal
to
consume
liquor
off
the
base.
the
only
law
cited
in
this
case,
and
it
is
actually
by
the
amicus
briefs,
is
that
provision
of
the
administrative
code
saying
that
all
liquor
imported
into
the
state
must
be
imported
through
a
licensed
wholesaler.
now,
the
state
tells
us
that
it
is
illegal
for
a
serviceman
to
have
untaxed
liquor
off
base.
we
can't
dispute
that,
if
that
is
what
the
state
is
now
saying.
but
there
are
no
penalties
if--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--the
labeling
would
be...
no,
it
is
an
incomplete
way,
and
it
is
an
incomplete
way
for
the
reason
i
gave
before.
the
state
doesn't
require
any
labeling
for
those...
we
do
buy,
just
for
the
court's
information,
in
north
dakota
we
do
buy
some
liquor
from
in-state
sources.
we
don't
buy
all
of
it
from
our
warehouse,
it
is
not
all
shipped
to
our
warehouse.
and
so
the
reason
it
is
an
ineffective
requirement
is
there
is
no
label
on
those...
on
those,
first
of
all,
on
the
beer
and
wine.
there
is
no
label
on
the
beer
and
wine.
and
it
is
always
going
to
be
cheaper
on
the
base.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
the
servicemen
are
told--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--we
tell
the
servicemen
that
we'll
sell
it
to
you,
but
if
you
take
it
off
the
base
you
are
subject
to
state
law.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
oh,
sure,
or--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
and
also...
i
mean,
the
example
cited
in
washington
where
someone
was
essentially
selling
to
another
liquor
store.
you
could...
a
state
liquor
inspector
could
walk
through
a
liquor
store,
go
through
the
inventory
and
say
well,
there
is
no
label
on
this,
where
did
you
get
it
from?
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
it
certainly...
anyone
who
knows
the
liquor
business
would
know
that
you
would.
and
i'll...
i
can
explain
to
the
court...
i
mean,
this
is
the
reason,
and
justice
kennedy
alluded
to
it
before.
the
labels,
of
course,
are
so
innocuous
looking
and
they
are
so
cheap,
but
it's
breaking
down
the
packaging.
a
lot
of
liquor
comes
directly
from
overseas.
it
is
packaged
overseas.
if
the...
if
the
distiller,
it's
actually
the
importer,
has
to
break
down
the
liquor
once
it
comes
here...
he
doesn't
care
about
the
labels.
it's
the
labor
of
doing
this,
instead
of
the
way
he
normally
does
his
business
is
just
ship
it
to
whichever
state
or
ever
local
distributor
he
is
going
to.
and
so
i
don't
think
it
takes
any
leap
of
faith
to
understand
why
five
of
our
prime
source
distributors
said
we
are
not
going
to
do
business
with
you
any
more.
and
one
said
well,
we'll
still
do
business
but
we
are
going
to
raise
our
prices.
and
another
curious
aspect
of
the
case
is
we
will...
the
distributors
and
why
they
don't
file
their
amicus
brief,
or
why
they
are
not
here,
we
are
going
to
still
buy
their
liquor.
we
are
still
going
to
be
buying
johnnie
walker
black
from
somerset
importers;
we're
just
not
going
to
be
buying
it
directly
from
the
shop.
we're
going
to
be
buying
it
from
somerset
importers
outlets
in
north
dakota.
so
somerset
importers
says
fine
with
us.
and
that
is
the
problem,
because
under
federal
law
the
price
differential
from
a
distiller
to
a
local
importer
is
uniform.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
at
times
i
did,
but
i
don't
think...
the
government
can
stand
on
its
own
briefs
and
its
own
arguments.
just
one
final
point
because
the
state
does
rely
principally
on
the
twenty-first
amendment.
again,
we
have
no
quarrels
with
the
idea
that
the
state
can
take
all
sorts
of
measures
to
police
trafficking
of
liquor
within
their
borders.
but
that
is
not
this
case
because,
even
as
mr.
spaeth
suggested,
what
they
really
concerned
is
what
happens
on
the
base.
and
that
is
not
something
the
twenty-first
amendment
gives
them
the
authority
to
do.
off
the
base,
that's
a
different
matter.
but
on
the
base
and
the
federal
procurement
is
something
that
they
can't
do,
and
those
are
the
mississippi
cases.
so,
no
further
questions.
thank
you.
