justice
scalia
general
spaeth,
you
say
it
is
like
a
lot
of
other
state
regulation.
well,
in
one
significant
respect
it
differs
from
other
state
regulation,
and
that
is
it
explicitly
applies
only
to
sellers
to
the
united
states
government.
justice
scalia
that
is
a
big
difference.
justice
scalia
well,
how
does
this,
how
does
this
in
favor
of
the
government
in
any
respect?
justice
scalia
they
just
have
to
label.
justice
scalia
do
you
think
you
could
do
that,
you
could
go
the
other
route?
justice
scalia
re...
impose
the
tax,
require
the
base
to
buy
it
from
your...
require
the
federal
enclaves
to
buy
it
through
the
distributor
system?
justice
scalia
general
spaeth,
i
didn't
understand
the
last
statement
you
made.
you
said
if
we
don't
let
you
do
this
you
don't
under...
you
don't
know
what
you
can
do.
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that
you
could...
you
could
readily
impose
a
sales
tax
on
the
sales
at
the
base.
justice
scalia
readily.
justice
scalia
--i
mean,
i
assume
they
would
want
to
find
all
liquor
that
hasn't
paid
the
state
tax,
whether
it
is
federal
liquor
or
non-federal
liquor.
so,
the
system
you
suggest
would...
would
be
even
better
than
the
system
that
north
dakota
has
applied.
it
will
enable
you
to
identify
not
only
the
bootleg
federal
liquor,
but
the
bootleg
minnesota
liquor.
justice
scalia
and
you...
that
is
a
10
percent
profit
margin,
assuming
you
had
to
pay
the
same
rent
for
stores
and
everything
else.
i
mean,
you're
leaving
out
of
that
the
fact
that
you
are
not
only
selling
lower,
but
you
have...
you
have
fewer
costs.
justice
scalia
well,
i
guess
the
state
wants
to
be
able
to
identify
these
bottles
off
base,
if
they
should
come
across
a
cache
of
liquor
in
a
barn.
justice
scalia
for
example,
say
ah
ha,
this
is
untaxed
liquor,
i
see
these
little
orange
labels
on
it
which
you
can't
get
off.
i
assume
that
that
is
the
purpose
of
it,
isn't
it,
to
identify
the
bottles--
