justice
kennedy
can
you
peel
it
off
the
podium
there?
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
do
you
take
the
position
that
it
is
not
a
burdensome
requirement?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
why
couldn't
the
state
just
require
all
of
the
liquor
sold
in
its
stores
to
have
the
sticker
that
it
was
sold
in
the
stores?
and
then
the
federal
government
would
not
be
impeded
and
you
could
accomplish
your
goal.
justice
kennedy
does
the
state
have
any
regulatory
interest
in
liquor
brought
in
from
minnesota?
doesn't
it
have
the
same
regulatory
interest,
or
is
the
tax...
or
is
that
not
a
problem
because
the
price
is
high?
justice
kennedy
i...
i
take
it
the
$20
a
case
figure
could
include
also
the
substantial
cost
of
having
to
keep
separate
inventories
in
the
warehouse
of
the
stickered
and
the
non-stickered
liquor.
because
the
stickers
are
put
on,
i
assume,
before
it
is
put
in
the
box
and
well
before
it
is
shipped.
justice
kennedy
and
of
course,
if
your
view
prevails,
you
can
have
every
state
requiring
stickers
and
then
the
distiller
would
have
to
keep
49
separate
inventories.
justice
kennedy
is
that
true
if
the
supplier...
that's
not
true
if
the
suppliers
are
out
of
state.
justice
kennedy
--well,
i
suppose
it
is
also
not
implausible
to
assume
that
the
sticker
requirement
is
so
burdensome
that
you
will
have
to
buy
through
the
local
wholesaler.
justice
kennedy
--well,
is
it...
what
is
the
penalty
for
possessing
liquor
in
north
dakota
which
has
not
been
purchased
through
a
wholesaler?
justice
kennedy
well,
is
there
a
violation?
justice
kennedy
so
the
penalties
we
are
talking
about
is
possession
of
liquor
for
resale?
