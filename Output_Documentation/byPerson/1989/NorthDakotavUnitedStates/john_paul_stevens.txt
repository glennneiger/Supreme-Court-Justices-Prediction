can
they
be...
may
i
just
ask,
you're
worrying
about
the...
having
somebody...
an
officer
buy
so
much
liquor
he
could
open
his
own
liquor
store,
he
could
peel
off
these
labels
pretty
easily,
couldn't
he?
justice
stevens
well,
what
you
are
saying
is
you
don't
need
the
stickers
because
the
market
takes
the
place
of
it
there.
i
don't
understand...
now
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
the
hypothetical.
if
you...
if
you
required
labels
on
all
liquor
that
was
sold
through
your
own
distributors,
that
would
take
care
of
all
the
problem,
because
it
is
too
expensive
to
bring
it
in
from
minnesota.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
there
is
no
similar
price
differential
between
the
minnesota
liquor
and
the
north
dakota
liquor.
justice
stevens
and
therefore,
if
you
required
all
north
dakota
wholesalers
and
retailers
to
spend
the
three
cents
for
these
stickers
on
their
liquor,
anything
that
didn't
have
it
would
either
be
from
minnesota
or
from
the
base.
justice
stevens
and
presumably,
it
wouldn't
be
from
minnesota
because
it
doesn't
save
any
money
to
get
it
from
minnesota.
so
you
would
then
identify
the
base
liquor
because
it
wouldn't
have
a
sticker
on
it.
justice
stevens
i'm
really,
i
don't...
aren't
there
minnesota
tax
stamps
on
the
minnesota
liquor?
justice
stevens
there
are
not.
justice
stevens
excuse
me,
as
far
as
the
minnesota
liquor
is
concerned,
i
assume
it
is
a
violation
of
the
states
law
to
bring
in
untaxed
liquor,
untaxed
by
north
dakota,
whether
it
is
taxed
by
another
state
or
not.
can
you--
justice
stevens
i
suppose
that
also
there
is
probably
not
as
high
a
mark
up
on
the
base
either.
but,
mr.
lazerwitz,
has
the
federal
government
ever
required
the
bases
to
label
the
stuff,
or
to
require
the
supplier
to
but
a
base
on
it...
a
label
on
it
indicating
it
is
tax-free
liquor?
justice
stevens
no,
but
you
can
take
it
home.
would
it
be
impossible
for
the
federal
government
to
affix
the...
spend
the
three
cents
and
fixing
these
labels
on.
justice
stevens
the
state
can't
make
you
do
it.
justice
stevens
but
you
could
presumably
satisfy...
if
you
were
willing
to
go
to
that
burden,
you
could
probably
get
the
liquor.
if
the
supplier
won't
sell
it
because
of
the
burden,
you
could
probably
get
it
by
paying
a
three
cents
a
bottle.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it
is
also
true,
i
suppose,
that
they...
to
the
extent
that
there
is
liquor
bootlegged
off
the
base
in
large
volumes,
you
get
the
benefit
of
that
by
increased
sales
and
increased
profit
to
support
your
day
care
centers.
justice
stevens
so
you
actually
have
a
financial
interest
in
having
the
state
law
violated,
in
the
way
they
are
complaining
about
it.
justice
stevens
it
may
not,
but
if
its,
if
the
figures
he
has
given
us
are
correct--
justice
stevens
--it
is
apparently
a
serious
problem
that
the
commander
of
the
base
should
have
been
able
to
see
was
going
on
out
there.
justice
stevens
--general
spaeth,
i
had
two
questions.
first,
in
view
of
the
colloquy
with
your
adversary,
and
you
mentioned
this,
three
cents
a
label,
it
is
fairly
clear,
is
it
not,
that
if
the
wholesaler
has
to
un,
open
up
all
these
cartons
and
stick
the
labels
on
individual
bottles,
it
is
a
substantial
burden
in
labeling.
justice
stevens
it
is
a
lot
more
if
you
have
to
open...
i
mean
just
opening
a
liquor
case
takes
a
little
work,
you
know,
and
it's...
and
then
getting
each
bottle--
justice
stevens
--and
so
that
is
what
we
are
talking
about,
is
that?
justice
stevens
and
the
second
thing,
is
there...
maybe
you
have
answered
it,
i
just
wasn't
entirely
clear.
does
north
dakota
require
any
kind
of
stamp
on
the
bottle
on
which
the
tax
is
paid?
is
there
anything...
evidence
it
does?
justice
stevens
don't
many
states
do
that?
justice
stevens
yeah.
