justice
white
well,
that
isn't
all
the
law
says,
is
it?
you
can
avoid
putting
that
label
on
if
you
do
something
else.
justice
white
oh
yeah,
yeah.
[laughter]
justice
white
all
right,
all
right.
justice
white
well,
why
would
that...
don't
you
want
to
keep
the...
you
don't
want...
you
can't
even
use
the
liquor
off
the
base--
justice
white
--under
this
law.
justice
white
but
if
you...
if
it
is
bought
from
a
local
distributor--
justice
white
--you
may
take
it
off
the
base.
justice
white
xxx
i
gather,
if
the...
if
you
don't
comply
with
the
labeling,
then
you
have
to
be...
work
through
the
state
wholesalers--
justice
white
--and
you
have
to
pay
the
tax,
and
inevitably,
the
price
of
liquor
then
delivered
to
the
base
will
go
up.
justice
white
every
bottle
will
be...
will
cost
more.
justice
white
and
in
the
long
run
the
people
on
the
base
will
be
paying
the
same
price
as...
as
people
pay
off
the
base
at
local
stores.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
they
don't
label
they
go
through
that.
justice
white
xxx
liquor
at
the
lowest
prices
available.
justice
white
no
matter
what
the
price
is,
it
is
the
lowest
price
that
is
available.
justice
white
to
cure
a
danger
to
your
own
economy.
justice
white
but
not
cure
it.
justice
white
suppose
that
all
suppliers
would
go
ahead
and
put
the
labels
on
with
the
inevitable
result
that
the
price
would
go
up.
if
that
were
the
case,
there
would
be
no
interference
with
getting
the
lowest
competitive
price.
justice
white
but
somebody
has
to
be,
some
suppliers
have
to
say
no,
and
the
base
would
want
to...
nevertheless,
to
purchase
from
those
suppliers.
we
don't
even
know
whether
they
would
want
to
continue
to
purchase
from
them
if
they
had
to
pay
this
higher
price.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
they
would
say
okay,
so
long,
friend.
if
you
don't
want
to
sell
under
this
basis,
why,
that's...
take
your
business
some
place
else.
justice
white
you
don't
need
to
have
a...
you
don't
need
to
have
a
full
line
of
whiskey
to
make--
justice
white
--we
are
arguing
about
something
that
really
there
are
no
findings
about,
so--
justice
white
who's
supposed
to
read
these
labels,
do
you
suppose?
who
does
the
state
want
to
read
those
labels?
justice
white
yeah,
but
they...
so,
do
they
think
this
is
really
going
to
be
an
effective
way
of
curing
their
problem?
because,
after
all...
all
the
label
does
is
repeat
what
is
in
the
military
law--
justice
white
--don't
sell
off
the
base,
don't
use
off
the
base.
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
there...
i
would
think,
i
would
think
if
this...
putting
on
this
label
is
not
an
effective
way
of
curing
the
problem
they
want
to
cure,
that
you
would
argue
that.
do
you
think
this
is...
let's
assume
there
is
a
problem.
do
you
think
the
labeling
is
an
effective
way
of
curing
it?
justice
white
but
for
the
state
to
think
this
is
going
to
cure
their
problem,
somebody
has
to
read
the
label
and
say
gee,
i
had
better
obey
what
this
label
says.
justice
white
but
that
is
no
different
than
what
the
military
already
requires.
justice
white
but
you
don't
think
it
is
going
to
add...
be
a
deterrent
effect
to...
i
mean,
somebody
reads
that
label
and
says
i
should--
justice
white
isn't
there
some
rule
you're
not
supposed
to
be
in
possession
of
untaxed
liquor
in--
