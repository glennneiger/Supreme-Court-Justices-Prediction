chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-926,
north
dakota
versus
the
united
states.
general
speath,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
supposed
to
tax
our
credibility?
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
general
spaeth,
one
of
the
affidavits
submitted
on
behalf
of
the
government
indicated
that
one
out-of-state
wholesaler
said
he
was
going
to
have
to
raise
his
price
something
like
$20
a
case
if
this
requirement
went
into
effect.
are
there
more
costs
connected
with
it,
the
putting
on
the
label,
than
we
might
guess,
or
is
this
just
a
rather
extravagant
estimate,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question.
the
posture
of
the
case
is
that
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
state;
the
eighth
circuit
reversed
and
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
united
states.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
if
there
were
any
triable
issue
in
fact
in
the
case,
both
courts
were
wrong,
in
effect.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
think
there
is
a
disagreement
among
you
as
to
whether
there
is
a
"burden"
or
not.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
i
am
not
so
sure
that
isn't
a
factual
question.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
one
gets
the
impression,
general
spaeth,
from
reading
about
what
congress
did,
that
the
intent
was
to
require
the
bases
to
purchase
locally
when
they
are
talking
about
beer
and
wine,
but
to
allow
liquor
to
come
in
from
out
of
state
as
well
as
locally,
and
be
competitive,
when
you
are
talking
about
hard
liquor.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
spaeth.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lazerwitz.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
now...
but
that
is
basically
an
issue
of
fact,
don't
you
think,
mr.
lazerwitz?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
these
regulations
would
require
the
government
to
pay
more
money?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
more
money
than
what?
but...
i
don't
see
how
that
is
dispositive
of
a
basic
factual
question.
if...
supposing
out-of-state
suppliers
required
to
put
on
this
sticker
if,
what
mr....
general
spaeth,
says
is
true,
they
cost
three
cents,
they
will
have
to
pass
that
along
to
the
purchasers.
but
i
don't
see,
so
long
as
the
other
state
shippers
are
willing
to
keep
shipping
to
these
bases
and
simply
add
on
the
cost
of
this,
i
don't
see
how
the
government
plan
for,
you
know,
competitive
purchasing,
is
defeated.
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay,
but
do
we
know
how
many
source
suppliers
you
had?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that
proves
five
wouldn't
do
it.
if
there
were
20
suppliers,
maybe
five
not
doing
it
would
make
no
difference.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
is
this
all
in
the
record?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you...
but,
you're
defending
a
summary
judgment
on
the
basis
of
a
statement
that
five
out-of-state
suppliers
said
they
would
no
longer
supply.
the
record
doesn't
say
how
many
potential
out-of-state
suppliers
there
were.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
they
wouldn't--
--but
general
spaeth
says
that
doesn't
work
at
grand
forks
because
it
is
on
the
border.
minnesota
doesn't
require
a
tax
stamp,
so
you
can't
tell.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
is
one
of
the
many
things
we
don't
know
in
this
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
feel
you
may
need
amicus
briefs
to
win
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazerwitz.
general
spaeth,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you
general
spaeth.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
