mr.
carroll,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
is
it
your...
you
are
basically
saying
that
under
the
board's
rule
the
union
always
wins?
and,
as
i
understand
it
though,
under
your
rule,
if
the
company
hires
one
more
than
50
percent
of
the
unit,
the
company
will
always
win?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
actually
say
who
is
right,
but
isn't
that
fairly
accurate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
how
can
the
board
win
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
will
win
the
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
supposing
they
file
a
refusal
to
bargain
charge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
am
saying
any
such
case
you
would
win
by
hiring
one
more
than
half
of
the
bargaining
unit,
under
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
in
your...
which
i
am
saying
in
every
case
will
be
that
51
percent
of
the
members
of
the
bargaining
unit
are
replacements
workers,
and
it
is
rational
to
assume
they
are
anti-union.
that's
the
whole
case,
and
you
win.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
right,
and
then...
because
the
employer
doesn't
have
anything
else
to
go
on,
and
that
is
sufficient
to
establish
a
good
faith
doubt.
i
am
not
suggesting,
maybe
you
are
right,
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
either
one
rule
or
the
other.
