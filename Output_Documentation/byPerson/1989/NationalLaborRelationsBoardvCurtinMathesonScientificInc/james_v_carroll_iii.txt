mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
perhaps
the
most
glaring
defect
in
the
board's
station
kkhi
rule
is
its
failure
to
come
to
grips
with
the
evidence
in
this
case
that
curtin
matheson
hired
a
new
work
force
of
permanent
replacement
employees
who
never,
by
word
or
deed,
have
expressed
any
interest
whatsoever
in
the
incumbent
union.
this,
coupled
with
the
inherent
conflict,
which
the
board
has
recognized
for
decades
to
exist
in
this
situation,
condemns
as
irrational
the
board's
position
in
this
case.
as
justice
scalia
observed
in
the,
in
one
of
the
cases
in
our
brief,
leveld
wholesale,
the
board
acknowledged
that
the
replacement
employees
may
reasonably
foresee
that,
if
the
union
is
successful,
they
are
going
to
be
fired
to
make
room
for
the
returning
strikers.
this
is
a
general
proposition
which
the
board
accepts.
it
is
not
a
fact-finding
in
a
specific
case,
it
is
a
given.
it
is
an
industrial
reality
that
we
deal
with
in
these
situations.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
well,
your
honor,
that
is
true,
and
the
board
cites
two
cases,
it
services
and
stormer,
in
its
brief,
footnote
12.
those
cases
were
decided
during
the
pennco
rule
reign,
not
during
the
rule
in
question
before
this
court.
those
cases
were
decided
in
'82
and
'84,
respectively.
and
this
decision
emanated
in
1987,
three
years
later.
that...
those
cases
do
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
board's
present
application
of
this
rule
represents
a
reasoned
evaluation
of
evidence,
because
a
different
rule
pertained
then.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
your
honor,
in
the
first
place,
the
station
kkhi
rule
is
a
rule
that
pertains
both
to
prestrike
end
situations,
in
other
words
withdrawals
of
recognition
which
occur
during
the
strike.
and
in
roughly
half
of
the
cases
decided
since
station
kkhi
that
has
been
the
case;
the
rule
is
applied
in
those
circumstances.
so
that...
so
that
whether
or
not
in
the
future
at
some
point
in
time
the
parties
may
kiss
and
make
up
is
really
not
relevant
to
an
understanding
of
the
board's
role
for
the
kkhi
rule.
and
in
any
case
you--
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
--absolutely,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
fair
to
ask
the
question.
i
wish
the
employer
could.
the
board
imposes
a
rule,
the
no
polling
rule,
which,
in
direct
response
to
your
question,
justice
white--
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
--that
is
correct,
and
we
think
that
is--
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
--the
question
is
whether
they
want
this
particular
union.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
the
incumbent
union.
exactly.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
and
in
truth,
and
in
fact,
the
board's
so-called
no
presumption
rule
is
not
a
no
presumption
rule
at
all.
the
way
the
rule
works,
and
we
submit
the
only
way
that
it
can
work
under
these
circumstances,
is
for
a
choice
to
be
made
by
the
board
as
to
the
initial
way
in
which
it
is
going
to
evaluate
replacement
evidence.
you
can
either,
as
the
board
does,
assume
that
replacement
employees
support
the
union,
unless
the
union...
unless
the
company
proves
otherwise.
and
that
is
the
way
this
rule
works,
has
worked
since
the
pennco
case.
or
you
must
assume,
as
the
employer
contends,
and
as
the
fifth
circuit
found,
that
replacement
employees
will
not
support
the
union,
unless
the
union
or
the
board
establishes
facts
which
dispel
that
reasonable
doubt
that
the
employer
professes.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
your
honor--
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
--well,
as
i
read
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion,
it
did
rely
on
professor
gorman's
statement
from
his
treatise,
which
merely
reflected
the
25-year
history
of
the
board's
dealing
with
this
evidence.
then
the
fifth
circuit
went
on
to
say
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
find
the
employer
could
reasonably
doubt
that
replacement
employees
support
the
union.
and
that
was
the
real
holding
of
the
court.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
justice
o'connor,
i
believe,
as
i
was
saying
earlier,
there
are
really
only
one,
only
two
choices
for
the
board
when
replacements
are
hired.
the
board
approaches
the
question
of
determining
good
faith
doubt
based
on
a
numerical
evaluation.
and
this
is
right,
because
the
doubt
has
to
run
as
to
a
majority
of
the
employees,
not
merely
as
to
some
of
the
employees.
the
board
begins
by
aggregating
cross-overs,
there
were
five
in
our
case;
strikers,
there
were
19
in
our
case;
and
replacement
employees,
25
in
our
case,
for
a
total
of
49.
they
start
from
the
premise
that
we
must
prove
doubt
as
to
25,
that
is
a
simple
majority
of
the
49.
the
board
then
analyzes
the
evidence,
piece
by
piece,
and
as
to
any
employee
with
respect
to
whom
the
employer
has
established
fair
doubt,
that
name
is
removed
from
the
union
support
column
and
put
into
the
good
faith
doubt
column.
piece
by
piece,
employee
by
employee,
the
board
goes
through
this
process.
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
board
determines
whether
or
not
fair
doubt
has
been
raised
with
respect
to
a
majority.
in
this
case,
the
cms
case,
at
page
34a...
excuse
me,
page
75...
page
34a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix,
where
we
find
the
cms
case
reprinted,
the
board
found
that
the
employer
had
only
raised
a
doubt
as
to
six
of
49.
you
see,
that
because
49
remains
the
denominator
in
this
case,
and
we
must
bring
into
doubt
25,
there
is
an
operative
presumption
that
these
people
support
the
union,
unless
we
produce
evidence
sufficient
to
bring
those
people
into
doubt.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
well,
undoubtedly
they
would,
mr.
chief
justice.
but,
in
celanese
the
board
ordained,
after
a
careful
balancing
of
the
competing
interests,
that
the
good
faith
doubt
test
was
in
and
of
itself
an
adequate
rebuttal
to
the
presumption
of
continuing
majority.
there
is
no
overlay.
the
board...
the
board
overworks
the
continuing
presumption
in
this
case,
because
it
applies
it
twice.
it
applies
it
as
the
board
did
in
celanese,
to
articulate
the
dual
standard,
minority
in
fact,
good
faith
doubt.
but
then
the
board
brings
that
presumption
of
continuing
majority
across
the
line
again,
and
applies
it
as
an
evidentiary
yard
stick
to
discount
and
to
disqualify
evidence
offered
by
the
employer
to
establish
doubt,
and
therein
lies
the
problem.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
your
honor--
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
--we
argue
two,
for
two
results.
position
a
is
that
in
all
cases
where
replacements
are
hired,
an
employer
may
reasonably
doubt
that
the
replacements
support
the
union,
unless
the
board
or
the
union
comes
forward
with
evidence
which
tends
to
undermine
that
doubt.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
well,
i
would
not
make
that
argument,
no,
sir.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
and
specifically
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
where
the
persons
were
hired
during
the
course
of
the
strike,
and
recognition
was
withdrawn
at
the
time
that
the
union
requested
reinstatement,
a
few
days
after
that
time.
certainly
there
is
nothing
that
has
happened
in
the
intervening
several
days
which
would
dispel
the,
we
believe
the
required
evaluation
of
this
evidence.
that
based
upon
the
replacement
employees'
knowledge
that
the
incumbent
union
seeks
their
ouster
and
is
going
to
try
to
get
them
fired
in
order
to
make
room
for
the
returning
strikers,
that
no
rational
replacement
under
those
circumstances--
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
--the
board
has
a
rule...
our
second
position,
position
b,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
board's
rule
forecloses
the
evidentiary
weight
of
this
evidence.
because
the
board
now
ordains...
this,
by
the
way,
is
not
included
in
my
brief,
and
i
want
to
bring
to
the
court's
attention
three
cases.
they
are
all
cited
in
our
briefs,
but
not
for
this
proposition.
since
station
kkhi
was
decided,
and
since
the
cms
case
was
decided,
three
cases
have
been
decided
by
the
board.
now,
i
am
not
talking
about
aljs,
administrative
law
judges,
but
by
the
board
itself,
in
which
the
board
has
now
articulated
the
standard
under
the
kkhi
rule
to
be
the
employer
must
prove
that
the
replacement
employees...
excuse
me,
must
prove
the
replacement
employees'
expressed
desires
to
repudiate
the
union.
and
that
is
a
quote,
expressed
desires
to
repudiate
the
union.
that
formulation
of
the
evidentiary
burden
we
now
have,
in
order
to
be
able
to
rely
upon
evidence
that
replacement
employees--
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
--it
is
not,
and
all
i
can
do
is
ask
the
court
please
to...
review
those
authorities,
because
they
are
there
for
the
world
to
see.
in
fact--

mr.
james
v.

tile,
terrazo

is
a
case--
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
--of
the
nlrb's
opinion,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief.
all
of
the
parties,
or,
excuse
me,
all
of
the
two
amici
and
we,
cite
these
three
cases.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
you
will
find
the
citations
in
the
table
of
cases
of
several
of
the
briefs,
your
honor.

carroll,
iii
tube
craft,
at
footnote
2.
and
johns-manville,
at
about
page
5
in
the
slip
opinion.
in
each
of
those
cases
the
board
says
that,
as
a
consequence
of
the
kkhi
rule,
the
employer
must
prove
the
expressed
desires
of
the
replacements
to
repudiate
the
union.
in
footnote
12
of
the
board's
reply
brief,
it
says,
in
trying...
in
answering
the
15
pages
we
wrote
on
the
reasons
why
the
station
kka...
kkhi
test
abolishes
the
good
faith
doubt
test,
they
have
three
sentences.
one
of
those
sentences
says,
the
good
faith
doubt
test
is
alive
and
well,
and
it
is
different
from
the
minority
in
fact
test
because
it
admits
circumstantial
evidence.
and
i
ask
the
court
to
consider
whether
the
test
articulated
by
the
board,
expressed
desires
to
repudiate
the
union,
it
sounds
like
a
circumstantial
evidence
test.
it
is
not,
it
is
manifestly
not
a
circumstantial
evidence
test.
it
only
is
satisfied
by
direct
evidence.
and
this
is
the
board's
standard.
now,
inexplicably,
after
having
explained
its
standard
in
that
fashion,
the
board
goes
on
to
talk
about
the
evidence
in
those
cases,
but
it
always
comes
to
the
same
conclusion.
regardless
of
whether
there
is
violence,
regardless
of
whether
there
are
hostile
bargaining
demands
to
fire
the
replacements,
the
board
always
finds
that
there
is
inadequate
basis
for
good
faith
doubt.
and
we
submit
that
the
board
has
in
effect
emasculated
the
good
faith
doubt
standard.
it
professes
to
hold
to
that
standard.
it
proclaims
that
that
standard
governs
these
cases,
but
in
fact
the
board
does
not
apply
the
standard.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
it
may
or
may
not
be,
your
honor.
it
would
be
for
this
court
to
decide.
but
the
law
is
clear,
in
atchison,
topeka
&
santa
fe
railroad
case,
for
instance,
holds
that
if
the
board
is
going
to
depart
from
its
prior
norms
it
must
so
state.
it
must
advise
the
court
that
it
is
departing
from
the
prior
rule,
and
it
must
provide
its
reasons.
it
must
articulate
its
reasons,
so
that
you
can
do
your
supervisory
jobs
of
determining
whether
the
court's
decision...
the
board's
decision
is
both
rational
and
consistent
with
the
act.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
absolutely.
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
and
in
1951,
when
celanese
was
adopted,
the
board
struck
a
careful
balance
that
took
into
account
the
fact
that
we
may
have
a
new
group
of
employees...
in
that
case
there
were
108
replacements
hired...
a
new
group
of
employees
who...
who
have
a
right
as
a
consequence
of
being
the
majority
in
the
work
force,
to
say
whether
bargaining
will
occur
with
the
incumbent
union,
with
a
separate
union
of
their
own
choosing
to
which
the
loyalty
runs.
in
other
words,
the
new
union
would
have
its
loyalties
to
the
replacement
employees,
not
to
the
strikers,
which
is
certainly
most
probable
as
to
those
two
choices,
or
to
choose
to
remain
union
free,
which
is
the
choice
guaranteed
to
the
majority
under
section
7
of
the
act.
it
expressly
recognizes
that
the
majority
has
the
right
to
choose
to
refrain
from
collective
bargaining
if
that
is
its
wish,
and
this
court's
decision
in
international
ladies'
garment
workers'
union,
decided
in
1961,
so
holds.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
well,
that's
an
argument
that
the
board
makes.
this
is
the
doomsday
scenario.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not,
because
all--
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
--well,
the
union
can
win.
the
good
faith
doubt
test,
as
established
in
celanese,
took
account
of
the
fact
that
the
board
may...
excuse
me,
the
employer
may,
although
having
a
good
faith
doubt,
simply
be
incorrect.
the
union
may
have
its
majority.
and
in
that
case
the
board,
excuse
me,
the
union
need
do
nothing
more
than
proceed
to
the
nlrb,
file
a
petition
for
an
election,
i
am
sure
the
board,
with
the
due
regard
that
it
is
giving
to
the
rights
of
the
union
in
this
circumstance,
will
conduct
an
immediate
election,
and
it
should.
i
don't
see
why
it
should
take
any
more
than
a
few
days,
a
week
maybe,
determine
whether
or
not
the
majority
wants
the
union.
if
they
do,
the
union
is
reinstated,
the
bargaining
obligation
resumes,
the
parties
move
on
down
the
road--
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
--well,
there
wouldn't
be
one,
your
honor,
because
if
the
union
files
a
petition
for
an
election
to
resolve
this
question
once
and
for
all,
there
would
be
no
need
for
an
unfair
labor
practice
case.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
well,
if
they
did
that,
and...
it
would
act
as
a
blocking
charge
to
prevent
the
election.
but
that
is
within
the
board's...
excuse
me,
within
the--
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
--no,
justice
stevens,
because
the
union
should
and
would
remain
as
bargaining
agent,
if
it
continues
to
be
supported
by
a
majority.
the
only
thing
it
needs
to
do
is
file
a
petition,
have
an
election
and
resolve
the
issue.
and
there
is
no
permanency
to
a
breach
in
bargaining
on
the
basis
of
a
withdrawal
of
recognition
if
that
is
true,
that
is
to
say,
if
the
union
has
its
majority.
if
it
doesn't
have
its
majority,
of
course,
then
it
shouldn't
serve
as
bargaining
agent,
and
that
is
what
the
decisions
of
this
court
have
held
for
decades.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
absolutely,
it
would
be.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
if
we
could
get
it.
but
of
course
the
employer
cannot--
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
--no,
he
must
be
able
to
present
evidence
that
was
at
hand.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
the
board's
present
practice
is
not
to
allow
the
so-called
shifting
burden
doctrine.
but,
justice
white,
back
to
your
initial
question,
the
employer
is
required
to
proffer
the
evidence
that
was
before
it
on
the
withdrawal
of
recognition
date
which
supports
its
professed
good
faith
doubt.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
it
is
reasonable
for
the
employer
to
doubt
that
they
support
the
union.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
there's
a
big
difference
there,
your
honor,
but
yes,
that
is
the
bottom
line.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
well,
it
is
one
rule
or
the
other,
justice
stevens,
but
the
result
is
not
that
the
union
loses
its
bargaining
agency
necessarily.
because
once
the
employer
proffers
its
doubt...
it
doesn't
have
to
occur,
and
it
doesn't
occur
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
case.
i
mean,
the
union
can
call
up
and
say
okay,
you
are
withdrawing
recognition.
why?
the
employer
says
we've
got...
as
you
well
know,
we
have
hired
a
new
work
force
of
replacement
employees.
fine.
i
am
going
down
to
the
board
to
petition
for
an
election.
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
that
doesn't
work
just
fine
and
dandy.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
then
we
will
know
for
sure
whether
the
union
in
fact
has
majority
support
or
whether
it
doesn't.
and
then
we
won't
be
concerned
about
whether
we
have
denied
one
party
or
the
other
bargaining
rights
properly
or
improperly.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
well,
i...
first
of
all,
i
differ
with
that
view
as
to
what,
whether
that
is
a
good
policy,
given
that
we
have
a
new
majority
in
the
work
force
whose
section
7
rights
should
be
taken
into
account,
and
they
are
not
being
taken
into
account
under
the
board's
present
rule,
because
the
board
rules
in
all
cases
that
replacement
employees
simply
cannot
be
found
to...
doubt...
to
oppose
the
union,
based
on
the
way
it
is
applying
this
rule.
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
that
is
correct.
i--
mr.
james
v.
carroll,
iii
--there
may
be,
your
honor,
but
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
the
recognition
was
withdrawn
immediately
after
the
union
had
requested
reinstatement
for
the
employees.
and
this
is...
the
board
would
have
it
that
this
is
not
the
same
as
a
demand
for
ouster
of
the
strike...
of
the
replacements,
but
i
am
not
sure
they
saw
it
that
way.
now,
the
evidence
in
this
case
wasn't
litigated
on
that
standard,
because
we
litigated
this
case
under
the
pennco
rule
back
in
1980.
nine
years
ago
this
case
was
tried
before
the
alj,
at
a
time
when
the
pennco
rule
was
being
followed.
and
the
board
presumed,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
replacement
employees
support
the
union.
so
we
weren't
concerned
with
such
niceties
as
this
in
this
particular
trial.
i
don't
doubt
that
the
board
chose
this
case
to
bring
up
to
this
court
because
it
does
present
circumstances
that
are
more
benign
from
the
standpoint
of
withdrawal
of
recognition
than
many
others,
like
the
cases
which
we
have
cited
in
our
brief.
the
board,
at
footnote
4
of
its
reply
brief,
acknowledges
that
in
the
mid-1970s
it
began
to
turn
away
from
its
previous
view
that
replacement
employees
are
undoubtedly
opposed
to
the
union.
and
that
is
what
it...
those
are
the
words
used
in
the
reply
brief.
but
the
station
kkhi
case
states
that,
at
page
65a
it's
reproduced
in
the
petitioner's
appendix,
states
to
the
contrary.
the
board
denies,
in
station
kkhi,
its
25-year
history
of
operating
pursuant
to
this
rule.
at
page
65a
the
poard
writes,
after
discussing
the
peoples
gas
case,
we
continued
to
refrain
from
adopting
any
presumptions
regarding
the
pro
or
anti-union
sympathies
of
permanent
replacements.
and
that
is
flatly
wrong.
the
board
in
kkhi
denied
its
history
of
operating
pursuant
to
this
rule
for
25
years.
and
as
a
consequence,
of
course,
the
board
did
not
explain,
so
that
the
court
could
assess
this
history
and
experience,
what
was
wrong
with
the
rule,
if
anything,
during
that
25-year
period.
what
happened
during
that
period
to
cause
the
board
to
say
now
that
there
might
be
stonewalling
of
negotiations
and
the
like.
the
board
offers
no
explanation
whatsoever
regarding
the
history
of
the
application
of
the
rule
before
the
board.
and
further,
the
board
compounds
its
error
when
it,
at
page
75a
of
the
joint
appendix...
excuse
me,
the
petitioner's
appendix,
the
board
offers
its
policy
support
for
the
rule,
and
it
says
that
to
accept
the
gorman
presumption
would
disrupt
the
balance
of
competing
economic
weapons
long
established
in
strike
situations.
that's
simply
incorrect.
the
balance
of
competing
economic
weapons
has
been
struck,
or
was
struck,
for
25
years,
precisely
the
way
the
fifth
circuit
struck
it
in
this
case.
i
believe,
for
these
reasons
alone,
that
is
the
board's
denial
of
its
25
year
history
of
operating
under
the
rule
and
its
positioning
or
supporting
its
policy
grounds
on
the
idea
that
to
accept
the
gorman
presumption
would
disrupt
the
balance
of
competing
economic
weapons
long
established,
for
these
reasons
alone
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
to
find
the
board's
decision
in
kkhi
was
rational.
the
board's
explanation
that
an
employer
may
stonewall
negotiations
and
hire
replacements
and,
in
effect,
kick
the
union
out
by
this
vehicle,
is
also
not
supported
by
any
findings
or...
in
fact
that
is
post
hoc
rationalization.
the
board,
in
station
kkhi,
made
no
reference
to
those
possibilities,
and
certainly
brought
to
the
court's
attention
no
examples
of
that
kind
of
problem
in
the
25
years
when
the
presumption
of
continuing
majority
held
sway.
but
moreover,
in
our
case
there
certainly
were
no
allegations
of
any
such
misconduct.
and
the
board
has
ample
remedial
authority
in
the
act
to
deal
with
any
situations
of
that
kind.
section
8(a)(5)
requires
good-faith
bargaining.
section
8(d)
defines
good-faith
bargaining
to
include
meeting
at
reasonable
times.
you
can't
stonewall
negotiations.
there
are
concepts
in
the
labor
act
as
found
by
the
board
which
prevent
so-called
circus
bargaining,
where
the
employers
engage
in
bargaining
which
is
not
designed
to
reach
agreement.
all
of
these
provisions
of
the
act
can
come
into
play
to
prevent
an
employer
from
doing
what
the
board
says
could
occur
if
the
gorman
presumption
is
credited.
but
probably
the
most...
one
of
the
most
devastating
points
which
undercuts
the
board's
station
kkhi
rule
is
its
inconsistency
with
not
only
this
inherent
conflict
which
exists
between
strike
replacements
and
the
incumbent
union,
but
the
board's
position
in
the
service
electric
line
of
cases.
in
that
line
of
cases,
we
cite
this
line
in
our
brief,
as
does
the
chamber,
the
chamber
devotes
an
entire
section
to
this
particular
argument,
under
service
electric,
because
of
this
inherent
conflict,
the
board
has
ruled
that
the
union
cannot
represent
the
replacement
employees
during
the
strike,
because
it
has
a
conflict
of
interest.
it
would
like
to
get
them
fired.
in
fact,
it
is
the
union's
goal,
the
board
reasons,
to
get
them
fired.
and
because
of
this
inherent
conflict
the
board
cannot
represent
the
replacement
interest,
replacement
employees
during
the
strike.
and
yet,
the
board
would
suggest
that
the
replacement
employees
want
this
union
to
represent
them.
fatally
inconsistent
positions.
and
the
board
offers
no
explanation
to
reconcile
these
divergent
views.
and
because
of
that
failure
to
reconcile
its
position
in
the
service
electric
line
of
cases
with
its
position
in
station
kkhi,
this
court
does
not
owe
deference
to
the
board's
decision.
likewise,
the
fansteel
line
of
cases,
which
is
a
case
from
this
court
in
1938,
and
the
board
argues
that
because
it
is
so
old
it
doesn't
apply
here.
but
the
board
itself
has
applied
that
case
all
the
way
down
through
the
'70s
in
the
beacon
upholstery
case.
in
these
cases,
the
board
holds
that
it
is
proper
for
an
employer
to
withdraw
recognition
when
he
hires
permanent
replacements
for
strikers
who
have
been
lawfully
discharged.
and
one
wonders
what
the...
what
conceivable
difference
it
could
make
if
the...
if
the
strikers
on
the
one
hand
are
discharged
and
the
replacements
are
brought
in
for
them,
or
whether
the
strikers
are
on
strike
awaiting
reinstatement.
indeed,
i
suggest
that
because
the
replacements
are
on...
excuse
me,
the
strikers
are
on
strike
and
awaiting
reinstatement,
there
is
far
more
reason
to
believe
that,
from
the
replacement
standpoint,
they
are
more
concerned
about
having
the
incumbent
union
bring
these
people
back
than
they
would
be
in
the
case
where
the
strikers
have
been
lawfully
discharged.
and,
again,
the
board
offers
no
explanation
for
these
inconsistent
results
in
its
station
kkhi
decision.
and
for
these
reasons,
again,
the
board's
decision
is
entitled
to
no
deference.
but
it's
primary
policy
ground,
that
is,
the
doomsday
scenario
that
it
posits,
that
once
the
employer
hires
a
sufficient
number
of
replacements
to
outnumber
the
strikers
and
cross-overs,
the
employer
may
withdraw
recognition
and
therefore
disrupt
bargaining
stability.
that
argument
overstates
the
proposition,
because
all
the
union
needs
to
do
is
elect...
rather
than
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
and
become
mired
in
years
of
litigation,
all
it
has
to
do
is
file
its
petition
for
an
election.
the
board,
the
union
only
needs
30
percent
support
in
which
to
do
so.
i
am
sure
the
board
could
very
promptly
convene
an
election,
determine
the
question
whether
the
replacement
employees
want
the
union,
and
if
they
do,
then
the
bargaining
obligation
attaches
and,
indeed,
the
union
has
one
year
of
protection,
because
of
the
one
year
certification
rule
which
we
heard
discussed
here
today,
within
which
to
operate
without
fear
of
loss
of
majority.
there
simply
is
no
terminal
point
to
bargaining
as
a
consequence
of
an
employer
raising
a
good
faith
doubt.
and
we
believe
that
the
board's
statements
to
the
court
to
the
contrary
are
unfounded.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
relinquish
the
balance
of
my
time.
