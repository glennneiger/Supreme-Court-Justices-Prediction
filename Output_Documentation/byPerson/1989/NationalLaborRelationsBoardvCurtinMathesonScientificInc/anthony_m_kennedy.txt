justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
am
i
correct
that
in
no
event
may
that
election
be
held
within
12
months
of
the
previous
election,
or
is
that
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then
maybe
the
unions
who
filed
the
amicus
brief
are
correct
in
saying
that
there
should
just
be
a
12-month
period
during
which
the
union
represents
the
employees,
period.
is
there
anything
really
adverse
to
allowing
the
union
to
represent
the
employees,
whether
or
not
the
majority
then
supports
the
union,
given
vaca
v.
sikes
and
the
duty
of
the
union
to
protect
the
interests
of
the
employees
at
all
times?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
what
about
just,
if
it
were
just
limited
to
a
12-month
period?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
shapiro,
are
you
saying
that
the
board
in
this
case
has
the
option
under
the
statute
of
either
adopting
its
most
recent
presumption
or
its
present
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
most
recent
presumption
was
a
presumption
of
support.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
it
have
the
option
of
going
back
to
that
presumption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
guess
another
way
to
frame
my
question
is,
is
it
the
government's
position
that
this
is
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
act,
or
that
the
board
has
some
choices?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
should
the
board
be
given
deference
in
its
choices,
when
it
has
changed
180
degrees
in
its
interpretation
of
the
act?
they
had
a
presumption
one
way
and
then
a
presumption
in
the
other
way.
are
they
entitled
to
deference
in
light
of
that
administrative
history
of
interpretation?
