chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
88-1685,
the
national
labor
relations
board
v.
curtin
matheson
scientific,
inc.--
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
shapiro,
you
said
in
your
brief
and
you
mentioned
here
as
well,
that
the
board
has
decided,
that
the
policy
reasons
for
keeping
the
union
in
place
are
not
dissipated
by
reason
of
the
strike
and
replacement.
that
may
well
be,
but
that's
an
evolution
of
its
perception
as
to
what
the
law
should
be,
not
an
evolution
of
its
perception
as
to
what
the
facts
are.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
board
has
that
new
policy
perception
it
could
abandon
its...
its
current
rule
that
the
employer
need
not
continue
to
recognize
the
union
if
he
has
a
reasonable
doubt.
either
adopt
the
procedure
that
justice
kennedy
was
talking
about
or
adopt
some
other
procedure.
but
i
don't
see
how
the
board...
the
board
can
prescribe
facts.
it
can
prescribe
law,
but
not
facts.
it
seems
to
me
that
replacement
of
strikers
either
creates
a
reasonable
doubt
or
it
doesn't
create
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
if
the
board
says
no
it
doesn't
make
it
any
less
true.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
mr.
shapiro,
that
might
be
a
reason
for
abolishing
the
good
faith
doubt
rule,
which
would
justify
an
employer
from
withdrawing
recognition,
but
i
don't
see
it's
an...
it's
a
reason
for
restricting
the
factual
inquiry,
if
the
good
faith
doubt
rule
does
exist.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
carroll,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
gathered
from
mr.
shapiro's
presentation
that
the
board
would
not
agree
with
your
statement,
mr.
carroll,
that
they
find
a
number
of
different
situations
and
they
say
it
is
not
always
true.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
the
board
would
say
that's
the
operation
of
the
underlying
presumption
of
continuing
majority
support.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
board
tomorrow
were
to
simply
abolish
the
good
faith
doubt
test?
would
that
be
beyond
its
power?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
there
are
some
limits
upon
the
court's
ability
to
require
an
employer
to
continue
to
bargain
with
a
union
that
there
is
no
reasonable
basis
to
believe
is
the
choice
of
the
employees.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
carroll.
mr.
shapiro,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
mr.
shapiro,
if
the
board
excludes
a
lot
of
what
would
otherwise
be
normal
ways
of
proving
a
fact,
to
refuse
to
adopt
a
presumption
can
be
much
more
important
than
if
there
were
lots
of
other
ways
of
proving
facts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-1685,
national
labor
relations
board
versus
curtin
matheson
scientific,
inc.
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
