mr.
david
l.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
of
the
issue
of
this
case
may
be
simply
stated.
on
july
20,
1979,
four
days
after
the
end
of
an
economic
strike,
the
employer
withdrew
recognition
from
the
duly
certified
union.
at
that
time,
the
bargaining
unit
consisted
of
49
employees;
25
of
these
employees
were
permanent
replacements
who
had
been
hired
by
the
employer
during
the
economic
strike,
and
who
had
crossed
the
picket
line
to
get
to
work.
the
national
labor
relations
board
said
that
that
fact,
coupled
with
certain
other
facts...
i.e.,
the
record...
did
not
suffice
to
create
an
objective
basis
to
establish
a
good
faith
doubt
on
the
employer's
part
that
the
union
still
enjoyed
majority
support.
therefore,
the
withdrawal
of
recognition
was
an
unfair
labor
practice,
a
failure
to
bargain
in
good
faith
under
section
8(a)(5).
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
denied
enforcement
of
this
order.
the
key
to
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
was
its
determination
that
the
board
was
required
to
adopt
the
so-called
gorman
presumption,
that
it
was
compelled
to
infer
that
the
permanent
replacements
who
had
been
hired
during
the
strike
would
not...
did
not
and
would
not
support
the
union,
that
therefore
there
was
a
sufficient
objective
basis
to
support
the
employer's
withdrawal
of
recognition.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
your
honor,
i
think
two
things
are
clear.
one
is
that
the
board
does
not
exclude
that
evidence
as
irrelevant.
it
is
part
of
the
situation
on
which
the
board
makes
its
judgment.
and
there
are
indeed
cases
where
that
factor
along
with
other
significant
factors
have
counted.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--the
fact
that
replacements
have
been
hired?
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
think
it
is
a
relevant
fact,
and
that
in
certain
circumstances
it
may
well
make
a
difference,
but
that
it
has--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--well,
there
is,
at
the
moment,
i
think,
an
ongoing
dialogue
between
the
board
and
the
courts
of
appeals
on
exactly
what
is
required.
two
significant
cases
during
the
1980s
were
the
it
services
case
and
the
stormer
case
in
the
board,
in
which
there
had
been
significant
number
of
permanent
replacements
hired.
some
of
those
replacements
had
individually
expressed
opposition
to
the
union.
there
had
been
a
significant
amount
of
violence
on
the
picket
line.
there
had
been
insistent
union
demands
that
the
replacements
be
themselves
fired
and
that
the
strikers
be
reinstated.
there...
those
were
situations
in
which
the
board
held
that
a
good
faith
doubt
had
been
established.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
your
honor,
i
think
i
would
like
to
do
two
things
in
response
to
that
question.
first
of
all,
to
note
that
it
is
not
always
true
that
unions
are
demanding
right
up
to
the
point
that
recognition
be
withdrawn,
that
the
replacements
themselves
be
discharged.
i...
indeed
of
the
dold
case,
which
is
one
of
the
cases
recently
decided
by
the
board.
at
the
time
the
employer
withdrew
recognition
from
the
union,
the
union
had
acknowledged
that,
i
think,
something
like
170
of
the
200
replacements
were
entitled
to
the
jobs,
were
not
to
be
replaced.
so
that
situation
varies
from
case
to
case.
in
this
case
there
is
no
record
whatever
of
a
union
demand
that
the
replacements
be
fired.
there
was
simply
an
offer
to
return
to
work,
an
unconditional
offer
to
return
to
work.
but
i
think
there
is--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
think
they
would
have
liked
that.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
in
many
situations,
as
judge
williams
pointed
out
in
the
dissent
below,
the
accommodation
that
is
reached
is
for
the
employer
to
take
back
many
or
most
of
the
strikers,
although
some
have
been
gone...
may
have
gone
on
to
other
jobs,
to
take
back
many
or
most
of
the
strikers,
but
to
retain
many
or
most
of
the
replacements,
and
then
to
rely
on
a
process
of
attrition,
if
the
business
is
not
expanding,
to
bring
the
work
complement
back
to
what
it
was.
those
situations
do
vary
from
case
to
case
and
from
strike
to
strike.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
your
honor,
i
don't...
but
the
question
here,
i
think,
is
not
whether
a
board
decision
to
adopt
a
presumption
of
this
kind
is
correct
and
entitled
to
deference.
the
question
is
whether
the
board's
decision,
for
both
reasons
of
policy
and
what
it
regards
as
industrial
realities,
that,
to
regard
such
a
presumption
as
required,
is
reasonable
and
entitled
to
deference.
i
think
perhaps
it
is
the...
the
good
faith
doubt
test
is
absolutely
critical,
i
think,
to
an
understanding
of
this
case.
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
what
the
nature
of
that
good
faith
doubt
test
is
and
how
it
originated.
the
act
itself
imposes
an
obligation
on
employers
to
recognize
a
duly
certified
union
that
has
won
an
election.
the
act
makes
it
clear
that
that
obligation
ceases
if
there
is
a
decertification
election,
at
which
time
the
union
loses
its
majority
support.
the
act,
however,
says
nothing
about
whether
there
are
circumstances
in
which
an
employer
may
lawfully
and
unilaterally,
without
an
election,
withdraw
recognition
from
the
union.
so
the
board,
over
a
period
of
some
50
years,
has
considered
the
question
whether
there
are
circumstances
in
which
an
employer
may
lawfully,
unilaterally,
without
an
election,
withdraw
recognition
from
a
duly
certified
union.
the
board
has
said
that
there
are
such
circumstances,
but
that
in
the
interests
of
industrial
peace,
continuity
of
labor
relations
and
stability,
an
employer
may
not
do
so
if
the
union,
the
employer
and
the
bargaining
unit
still
exist,
may
not
do
so
during
the
first
year
after
certification,
may
not
do
so
during
the
normal
term
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
may
not
do
so
at
other
times,
unless
the
employer
may...
can
establish,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
the
union
has
lost
its
majority
or
that
there
is
a
sufficient
objective
basis
for
a
good
faith
doubt.
now,
that
last
rule
is
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
rebuttable
presumption
of
continuing
majority
support.
that
has
been
in
existence
for
over
50
years,
and
which
the
courts,
the
lower
courts
and
this
court,
have
unanimously
endorsed.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
your
honor,
i
was
backtracking
to
the
underlying
rule
that
said
that...
that
still
says
that
an
employer
may
withdraw
recognition
only
if
he
can
establish
that
the
union
no
longer
has
a
majority,
or
that
there
is
a
sufficient
objective
basis
for
a
good
faith
doubt.
now--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--until--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes.
until--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--until
the
mid-1970s.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
until
the
mid-1970s.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
the
board's
decision--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--that
they
support
the
union?
no.
there
is
not
strong
empirical
evidence
that
replacements
uniformly
or
as
a
general
rule
support
the
union.
but
what
the
board
was
saying
is
that
they
had
seen
a
wide
variety
of
cases
over
the
years
involving
very
different
situations
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
the
strike,
in
terms
of
the
degree
of
hostility
between
the
union
and
the
replacements,
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
the
picket
line,
in
terms
of
the
kinds
of
demands
the
unions
were
making.
justice
white,
i
think
that
the
position
of
the
board
from
the
very
beginning
has
been,
indeed
going
back
to
1939
and
'40,
that
the
existence
of
employee
turnover
is
not
in
itself
sufficient
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
continued
majority
support.
what
the
board
did
in
the
mid-1970s
was--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--a
kind
of
personnel
turnover,
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
what
the
board
had
consistently
said
was
that
the
policy
reasons
that
underlie
the
presumption
of
continued
majority
support
are
not
dissipated
as
a
result
of
employee
turnover.
now,
with
respect
to--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--there
is
a
disagreement
between
the
board
and
the
courts
of
appeals
on
the
basis
on
which
an
employee
can
conduct
a
specific
poll
with
respect
to
employee
preference.
but
what
an
employer
can
do,
and
the
board
agrees
on
that,
is
to
talk
to
workers,
including
replacements,
about
the
general
conditions
of
employment,
something
that
the
employer
did
do
here,
indeed
talked
to
15
of
the
replacements,
and
only
one
of
them
indicated
that
he
did
not
support
the
union
as
his
representative.
so
that
the
board,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--this
was
a
general
discussion
about
working
conditions
and
about
the
nature
of
the
job.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
the
board's
rule
is
that
an
employer
may
not
conduct
a
poll
under
conditions
in
which
it
does
not
have--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--not
supposed
to
conduct
a
poll
of
an
individual
worker.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
the
basis
for
the
board's
rule,
it
was,
i
think,
fully
explained
this
year
in
the
texas
petrochemical
case.
this
is
an
issue
in
which
the
board
and
the
courts
of
appeals
have
differed.
but
the
board's
rule,
which
says
that
you
cannot
poll
the
employees
in
situations
where
you
don't
have
a
sufficient
basis
to
petition
for
an
election,
is
based
on
its
view
that
it
should
not
be
easier
for
the
employer
to
conduct
an
informal
election,
with
all
the
potential
disruptions
that
that
involves,
than
it
would
be
for
the
board
to
conduct
a
formal
election,
where
it
consists...
insists
on
a
substantial
showing
of--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--on
the
present
record,
the
board
would
not
have
ordered
an
election.
because
the
board's
rule
essentially
is
that
an
election
may
be
held,
a
decertification
election,
either
on
the
petition
of
30...
30
percent
of
the
employees,
and
no
such
petition
was
filed
here,
or
on
an
employer
petition
when
there
is
a
sufficient
objective
basis
to
raise
a
good
faith
doubt.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
of
the
previous
election
or
the
previous
certification,
yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
think
the
union's
proposal
in
this
case,
the
amicus
brief,
is
a
stronger
proposal,
which
would
be
to
eliminate
altogether
the
ability
of
the
employer
to
withdraw
recognition
unilaterally.
so
that--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--well,
of
course
the
union
proposal
is
much
stronger
than
that.
and
i
would
say
limiting
the
union's
ability
to
represent
the
employees
to
a
12-month
period
would
go
against
the
indication
of
the
act
that
the
union
is
normally
entitled
to
continue
representing
the
employees
until
and
unless
they
lose
a
decertification
election.
and
the
act
also
makes
it
clear
that
decertification
elections
are
not
to
be
held
without
a
substantial
showing.
the...
the--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
what
has
happened
over
the
past
10
to
15
years
is
that,
first
of
all,
the
problem
came
to
the
fore
in
the
1970s.
there
had
been
occasional
cases
before
that
in
which
permanent
replacements
had
been
hired
constituting
50
percent
or
more
of
the
work
force.
the
board
had
developed
the
rule
that
that
was
sufficient
to
show
the
existence
of
a
good
faith
doubt.
i
think
those
cases
began
to
multiply
in
the
mid-1970s.
the
variety
of
those
cases
began
to
be
revealed;
the
underlying
policy
considerations
became
clearer.
and
in
the
course
of
that
development
the
board
articulated,
in
cases
like
pennco
back
in
1980
and
kkhi
more
recently,
both
empirical
and
policy
grounds
for
refusing
to
draw
the
inference
on
the
basis
of
the
hiring
of
permanent
replacements
alone.
the
board
had
seen
a
variety
of
situations
in
which
permanent
replacements
were
hired.
some
of
them,
like
it
services
and
stormer,
involved
considerable
violence,
involved
significant
union
demands
for
firing
of
the
replacements,
involved
other
factors
that
indicated
strongly
to
the
board
that
a
good
faith
doubt
had
been
shown.
cases,
however,
arose
in
which
there
were
no
other
facts
at
all,
in
which,
in
some
of
those
cases,
the
replacements
themselves
were
union
members.
in
which,
as
in
this
case,
there
was
very
little
activity
on
the
picket
line,
which
dwindled
practically
to
nothing,
in
which
the
employer
withdrew
recognition
not
during
the
period
of
the
strike,
but
four
days
after
the
strike
was
over.
in
which
union
demands,
if
they
were
made
at
all
for
firing
the
replacements,
were
made
only
in
terms
of
an
offer
of
the
strikers
to
return
to
work.
cases
in
which
union
had
long
since
demand...
abandoned
any
demand
for
firing
of
all
or
most
of
the
replacements.
and
so,
having
seen
this
wide
variety
of
cases,
and
having
considered
the
policy
reasons,
which
i
think
are
very
significant
in
this
case,
the
board
said
that
its
growing
understanding
of
both,
led
it
not
to
form
any
presumption.
and
that
what--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--well,
i
think
there--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--but,
to
the
extent
that
a
significant
number
of
cases
are
involved
in
which
permanent
replacements
are
strongly
opposed
to
the
union,
one
would
expect...
and
where
those
permanent
replacements
constitute
a
significant
percentage
of
the
work
force,
as
they
do
here,
one
would
expect
a
significant
number
of
decertification
petitions
coming
from
those
employees,
followed
by
elections
in
which,
in
fact,
union
was
rejected.
to
my
knowledge,
although
i
don't
have
the
statistics,
since
the
amendment
of
the
taft-hartley
act
in
1959,
such
elections
have
not
routinely
been
held.
what
has
happened
instead
is
that,
as
soon
as
enough
replacements
come
on
the
job,
the
employer
will
try
to
withdraw
recognition
on
the
basis
of
that
fact
alone.
and
i
think
the
board,
in
both
the
pennco
case
and
the
kkhi
case,
has
pointed
to
the
very
adverse
policy
effects
of
that
kind
of
a
decision.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
it's
situation--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
think
the
employees
can
be
expected
to
protect
their
own
interests,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
what
is
happening
here,
and
what
has
happened
in
many
cases
of
this
kind,
is
that
the
employee
is...
the
employer
is
putting
itself
forward
as
the
protector
of
the
employee
interest,
not
waiting
for
the
employees,
who
the
act
and
the
board
assumes
can
protect
themselves.
the
employee
is
putting
itself
forward
as
the
protector
of
the
employees'
interests.
this
court,
i
think,
has
continually
expect...
expressed--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--your
honor,
i
think
the
board
should
and
does
have
several
options,
one
of
which
is
to
curtail
much
more
drastically
than
it
has
done
the
employer's
ability
to
withdraw
recognition
unilaterally
without
a
decertification
election.
indeed,
it
may
well
be
that
the
board
could
eliminate
that
ability
entirely
as
a
matter
of
its
authority
under
the
act.
the
board
has
not
chosen
to
do
that,
because
it
might
well
lead
to
situations
where
unions
have
in
fact
significantly
lost
support,
and
yet
employers
are
obligated
to
continue
to
bargain.
so
the
union...
the
board
has
continued
with
its
existing
rule,
which
does
acknowledge
that
an
employer
can
withdraw
if
he
can
make
either
a
showing
of
loss
or
sufficient
basis
to
establish
a
good
faith
doubt.
i
don't
think
the
court
should
insist
that
the
board
must
go
the
whole
way
and
abolish
the
good
faith
doubt
test,
rather
than,
as
it
has
done,
to
set
up
a
rigorous
standard
under
which
that
good
faith
doubt
is
established.
the
policy
reasons--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--the
most
recent
presumption,
you
mean--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--that
existed
until--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
think
that
the
question
whether
a
presumption
of
the
kind
that
the
board
followed
until
the
mid-1970s,
whether
that
is
within
the
board's
power,
and
of
course
is
not
the
question
here,
but
i
think
a
very
strong
argument
could
be
made
that
a
board
decision
to
adopt
such
a
presumption
would
be
valid
and
should
be
sustained
by--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--we
believe
very
strongly
that
the
board
has
a
range
of
choices.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
don't
think
it
switched
from
one
presumption
to
another,
your
honor.
the
underlying
presumption,
which
i
tried
to
state
at
the
beginning,
has
always
been
the
presumption
of
continuing
majority
support.
that
has
never
changed.
until
the
mid-1970s
the
board
did
in
fact
presume
that...
that
permanent
replacements
did
not
support
the
union.
the
board
abandoned
that
presumption
in
the
mid-1970s,
and
has
abandoned
it
ever
since.
it
has
not
adopted
a
contrary
presumption.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
it
should
defer
to
the
board's
refusal
to
adopt...
to
return
to
its
former
presumption.
there
is
no
operative
presumption
with
respect
to
replacements
as
such.
the
policy
reasons
for
that
are
rooted
in
the
board's
conviction
that
if
such
a
presumption
were
adopted,
it
would
be
far
too
easy
for
employers
to
bargain
to
impasse,
to
precipitate
a
strike,
to
hire
enough
replacements
to
justify
the
withdrawal
of
recognition,
and
then
to
leave
the
employees
without
representation
at
the
most
critical
period
of
labor
relations,
during
an
economic
strike
as
it
is
coming
to
an
end,
and
in
trying
to
deal
with
its
aftermath.
it
is
for
that
reason
that
the
board
has
insisted
on
a
more
substantial
showing.
and
there
are
cases,
justice
o'connor,
to
return
to
your
question
at
the
outset,
in
which
the
board
has
held
that
such
a
showing
has
been
made
even
though
there
has
been
no
actual
head
count
of
employees.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor,
absolutely.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes.
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
compelling
the
board
to
adopt
the
presumption.
the
question
on
remand,
if
this
court
reverses,
is
whether
the
facts
of
this
case,
including
the
hiring
of
permanent
replacements,
constitutes
sufficient
objective
evidence
to
support
a
good
faith
doubt.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
point
i
think
is
very
important
to
stress.
that
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
the
board
must
consider
as
relevant
the
hiring
of
replacements
during
an
economic
strike,
nor
is
it
the
question
of
how
much
probative
weight
that
fact
may
be
entitled
to,
along
with
other
facts.
those
questions
are
the
subject
of
an
ongoing
dialogue
now
between
the
board
and
the
courts
of
appeals
in
cases
like
manville
and
bickerstaff.
the
question
in
this
case
is
much
narrower.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
court
may
properly
require
the
board
to
adopt
the
gorman
presumption.
the
question
whether
the
board
is
required
to
infer
that
a
permanent
replacement
hired
during
an
economic
strike
is
by
virtue
of
that
fact
alone
opposed
to
the
union.
therefore,
if
50
percent
or
more
of
the
employees
in
a
unit
meet
that
category--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--your
honor,
the
board
has
adhered
to
the
good
faith
test,
although
i
think,
as
several
members
of
the
court
have
suggested,
it
may
not
have
to.
but
it
has
adhered
to
that
test
in
the
light
of
a
rigorous
standard
of
proof.
it
does
accept
objective
circumstantial
evidence
of
non
support.
it
does
not
insist
on
a
head
count
of
employees
showing
that
50
percent
or
more
are
opposed
to
the
union.
how
much--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--that
question
of
what
is
a
sufficient
objective
basis
to
create
a
good
faith
doubt,
which
is
a
rule
that
the
board
itself
has
created,
is
itself
a
question
of
law
in
which,
we
submit,
the
board's
judgment
is
entitled
to
deference.
thank
you.
