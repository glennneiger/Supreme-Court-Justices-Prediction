justice
marshall
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
acted
within
its
discretion
in
refusing
to
admit
a
presumption
that
board’s
replacements
refuse
and
are
opposed
to
the
striking
union.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed.
the
chief
justice
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion;
justice
scalia
had
filed
a
separate
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
o’connor
and
justice
kennedy
have
joined.
