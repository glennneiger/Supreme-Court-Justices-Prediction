well,
it
couldn't
have
existed
for
50
years,
if
the
board's
old
rule
used
to
be
that
if
the
bargaining
unit
now
contains
a
majority
of
replacements,
that
that
establishes
a
good
faith
doubt.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
the
board
used
to
say
that
if
a
majority
of
the
bargaining
unit
consists
of
replacements
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--there
is
a
good
faith
doubt?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
rebuts
the
presumption.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
see
in
your
footnote
in
your
brief
you
say
the
board's
current
position
is
based
on
its
evolving
understanding
of
industrial
reality.
now,
have
they
had
some
really...
experience
with
the
fact
that
these
replacements
just
love
the
union?
or
that
they
want
to
join
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
they
claim
that
they
have
had
that
experience
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
categorize
replacements
during
the
strike
as
sort
of
personnel
turnover?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
remarkable
type
of
turnover.
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me,
how
do
you
suppose
the
employer
would
establish
some
objective
evidence?
is
he
permitted
to
go
around
and
poll
the
workers?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
he...
he
was
just
saying
how
do
you
like
it
here
and
things
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
he
is
not
supposed
to
say
are
you
in
favor
of
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he's
not
even
supposed
to
ask
one
worker,
is
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
poll...
he
can't
even
poll
one
person.
well,
if
this
is
a
factual
question,
what
is
the
basis
for
the
board's
rule
preventing
employer
inquiry?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if...
i
suppose
the
board
then
would
say
the
employer
would
not
be...
he
might
be...
he
might
petition
for
an
election,
but
the
board,
without
any
more
evidence
than
he
has
got,
wouldn't
order
a
new
election,
would
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
from
the
fact
that
the
union
would
like
to
get
the
replacements
replaced,
that
if
they
aren't
replaced,
the
replacements
that
are
going
to
stay
on
would
not
vote
for
the
union.
let's
assume
that
the
employer...
let's
assume
there
was
an
election.
i
think
it
is
probably
conceivable,
maybe
even
reasonable
to
think
that
the
replacements
would
vote
to
have
a
union
represent
them,
as
long
as
they've
still
got
their
job.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
don't
you
think
it
is
fair
to
ask
well,
would
the
replacements
like
to
have
the...
have
a
union
representation,
as
long
as
they
have
got
their
jobs?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
the...
but
the
board
refuses
to
infer,
just
from
the
fact
that
they
are
replacements,
that
they
would
not
vote
for
a
union.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
they...
i
don't
know,
that--
--is
that
correct,
mr.
carroll?
i
thought
that
the
board
is
assuming
that
they
will
vote
for
this
union.
is
that
all
that
the
issue
is,
whether
the
new
employees
want
a
union,
or
is
it
whether
they
want
this
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
thought.
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
an
unfair
labor
practice
proceeding,
evidence
of
the
actual
preferences
of
the
members
of
the
bargaining
unit
would
not
be
allowed,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
really?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
let's,
let's
assume
that
the
union
files
a
refusal
to
bargain
charge,
where
they
are
the
certified
bargaining
agent,
and
the
employer
won't
bargain
with
us.
and
the
employer
says
i
have
a
good
faith
doubt,
and
furthermore,
i'll
prove
it.
and
he
wants...
he
wants
to
put
in
evidence
of
the
actual
preferences
of
the
members
of
the
bargaining
unit,
and
he
wants
to
call
them,
every
one
of
them.
he
won't
be
allowed
to
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also
the
union...
union
would
not
have
to
prove
that
it
does
have
a
majority
in
such
proceeding.
