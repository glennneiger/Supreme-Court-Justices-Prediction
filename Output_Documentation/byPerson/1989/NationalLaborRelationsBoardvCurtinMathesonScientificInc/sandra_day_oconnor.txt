mr.
shapiro,
do
you
think
that
the
board
could
have
given
any
evidentiary
value
to
the
fact
that
it
was
replacement
workers
who
were
working?
maybe
not
required
to.
do
you
think
the
board
could
give
some
evidentiary
weight
to
that
fact?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it
should
count
for
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
else
is
necessary?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
there
a
difference
between
having
no
presumption
and
allowing
a
reviewing
court
to
consider
as
some
evidentiary
inference
the
fact
of
replacement
workers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
a
difference
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
carroll,
did
the
court
below
articulate
a
presumption,
do
you
think,
that
the
board
has
to
consider
that
the
replacements
workers
will
not
support
this
union?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
it...
or,
is
it
open
to
treat
it
as
an
evidentiary
inference,
if
it
is
justified?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
there
does
seem
to
be
a
difference
in
whether
there
has
to
be
a
presumption
one
way
or
another,
and
what
will
suffice
for
meeting
a
burden
of
proof
by
a
preponderance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
carroll,
that's
not
what
mr.
shapiro
said
today,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
footnote
2
of
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
a
page
in
a
particular
brief
that
is
filed
in
this
case
where
we
find
the
citation?
