mr.
shapiro,
i
can
under...
it
is
the
board's
rule
that
a
good
faith
doubt
suffices.
now,
i
can
understand
the
board
saying
we
no
longer
want
that
rule.
but
the
board
has
adhered
to
that
rule,
that
a
good
faith
doubt
suffices.
that
is
a
matter
of
law.
but
i
don't
see
how
whether
or
not
a
good
faith
doubt
reasonably
must
be
thought
to
exist
is
a
question
of
law.
i
mean,
it's
a
question
of
fact.
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
when
you
have
a
union
striking,
demanding
that
their
people
be
brought
back
and
that
the
scabs,
which
they
refer
to
them
as,
that
the
employer
has
hired,
be
dismissed,
it
seems...
how
can
you
possibly
say
that
the
employer
doesn't
have
a
good
faith
doubt
whether
these
scabs
want
to
join
the
union?
it
boggles
the
mind.
if
you
want
to
abolish
the
good
faith
doubt
rule,
that
is
one
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
wanted
their
members
rehired,
didn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
very
hard
to
get
your
members
rehired
if
the
people
that
have
been
brought
in
to
replace
them
are
not
told
to
leave.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
very
much.
in
fact,
the
board
itself
has
said,
hasn't
it,
that
"strike
replacements"
can
reasonably
foresee
that
if
the
union
is
successful
the
strikers
will
return
to
work
and
the
strike
replacements
will
be
out
of
a
job.
isn't
that
the...
you're
talking
about
the
existence
of
a
reasonable
doubt
on
the
part
of
the
employer.
this
involves
probabilities,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
agree
there
is
a
wide
variety
of
cases.
did
the
board
do
any
assessment
of
what
percentage
of
this
wide
variety
of
cases
the
hired
strike
breakers
favored
the
union?
did
they
do
any
assessment
of
that?
do
they
find
out
in
this
wide
variety
of
cases,
90
percent
didn't
favor
the
union,
or
40
percent,
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
simply
to
point
to
a
wide
variety
of
cases
is
just
not
very
intellectually
satisfying.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
the
board
is
relying
on
the
fact
that
a
strike
breaker,
who
was
already
in
enough
trouble
with
the
union
and
the
people
on
the
picket
line,
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
first
thing
he
does...
that
he
does
not,
as
soon
as
he
gets
on
the
job,
immediately
file
a
petition
to
decertify
the
union?
sort
of
sticking
his
thumb
in
the
union's
eye.
not
only
breaking
the
strike,
but
seeking
to
decertify
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
carroll,
are
you
arguing
for
a
presumption,
or
are
you
arguing
for
the
ability
of
the
employer
to
say
that
in
a
particular
case
the
fact
that
these
are
re-hires
from
a
strike
can
be
taken
into
account
to
determine
that
there
is
a
reasonable
doubt?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
do
you
say
it
must
always
lead
to
the
conclusion
of
reasonable
doubt?
justice
antonin
scalia
two
years
after
the
strike
is
over,
and
two
years
after
the
replacements
have
been
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
you
are
not
saying
that
it's...
that
it's
a
uniform
presumption.
you're
just
saying
that
one
may,
in
the
proper
circumstances,
conclude
from
the
re-hiring,
or
from
the
replacement.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
we're
talking
about
presumptions
here.
i
think
we
may
be
talking
about
the
fact
that
you
assert
that
the
rehiring...
that
the
hiring
of
a
strike
breaker
may
be
considered
relevant.
and
the
board
seems
to
be
saying
it
may
not
be
considered
relevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
tell
us
which
ones
they
are.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
not
serve
the
board's
policy
of
industrial
peace,
which
it
has
decided
is
better
served
by
leaving
the
current
union
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
again,
mr.
carroll,
though,
you...
it
seems
to
me
you
responded
to
justice
stevens'
question
a
little
too
categorically.
you're
not
saying
that
it
is
automatic.
i
mean,
you
answered
my
question
saying
that
if
two
years
have
gone
by
you
would
not
apply
the
presumption.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
may
be
some
other
circumstances.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shapiro,
the
question
is
not
whether
in
fact
these
employees
support
the
union
or
not.
that
is
not
the
question
under
the
board's
law.
the
question
under
the
board's
law
is
whether
the
employer
in
fact
has
a
reasonable
belief
that
they
do
not
support
the
union.
that
is
a
quite
different
question.
and
whether
you
can
use
it
as
a
presumption
for
the
one
is
quite
different
as
to
whether
it
necessarily
indicates
the
other.
it
is
very
hard
to
say
that
an
employer
who
replaces
a
striking
force
does
not
have
a
reasonable
belief
that
the
replacement
people
don't
want
to
be
in
the
union,
that
particular
one.
