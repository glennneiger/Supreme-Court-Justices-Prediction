justice
white
do...
do
you
agree
that
if
he
had
made
it
clear
that
it
could
be
used
only
for
so-called
impeachment--
justice
white
--it
would
have
been
all
right?
justice
white
so,
there
isn't
any
instruction
that
you
can
think
of
that
would
have
cured
this?
justice
white
well,
but
the
illinois
supreme
court
apparently
thought
that
there
would
have
been
error,
and
real
error,
if...
unless
there
was
an
instruction
that
the
evidence
could
be
used
only
for
impeachment
purposes.
justice
white
yes,
but
they
can't...
they
can't
anticipate
that
they
would...
they
can't
manufacture
the
opportunity
to
use
it.
the
way
the
illinois
court
put
it,
the...
the
evidence
you
want
to
contradict
would
have
to
be
brought
out
on
direct
examination
of
the
defense
witness.
justice
white
so,
that
the
officer...
the
prosecution
isn't
permitted
to...
to
bring
this
statement
out
that
would
justify
introducing
this
illegally
seized
evidence
on
cross-examination.
justice
white
it's
the
defense
that
is
offering
this
statement
that
is
contradicted
by
illegally
seized
evidence.
justice
white
well,
usually,
i
wouldn't...
i
wouldn't
suppose
the
officers
really
know
when
they
see
something
like...
like
this
that
it's...
they
don't
know
how
critical
it
might
be
to
their
case.
they
don't
know
whether...
many
times,
if...
if
evidence
they
seize
is
excluded
they
haven't
got
any
case
left.
justice
white
so
they're
taking
a
terrific
risk.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
we're
talking
about
evidence
here...
illegally
seized
evidence.
justice
white
if
you
had
to
make
your
case
without
that
evidence--
justice
white
those
fruits,
you
might
have
independently...
might
independently
come...
come
by,
if
you
hadn't
committed
the
illegality.
you
might
have
that
evidence
from
some
other
source.
justice
white
i
guess
it
wasn't
a
question;
it
was
a
statement.
just
say
yes,
it
was...
it
as
[inaudible],
even
though--
[laughter]
may
i
ask
another
question?
isn't
the...
if
we're
just
looking
for
a
bright
line,
and
maybe
it
isn't
the
best
bright
line,
isn't
the
bright
line
between
impeachment
and
substantive
evidence
equally
bright?
i
mean,
you...
you
could
draw
the
line
that
the
dissenters
would
have
drawn
in
this
case.
justice
white
so,
you
wouldn't
see
the
necessity
for
the
limitations
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
put
on
the
use
of
this
evidence...
two
of
them?
two
of
them.
justice
white
you
would
let...
you
would
let
the...
let
the
inconsistent
evidence
come
out
on
cross-examination
of
the
witness
and
then
use
the
illegal...
illegal
evidence
in
rebuttal?
justice
white
what...
what
was
behind
the
supreme
court's
statement
that
you
couldn't
use
in
rebuttal
any
of
the
defendant's
prior
statements
that
amounted
to
a
confession?
justice
white
what...
what's--
justice
white
--well,
that
would
almost
rule
out
most
of
the
statements
that
are
taken
in
violation
of
miranda,
i
suppose.
justice
white
we
don't
have
a
confession
in
this
case,
anyway.
justice
white
but
you
do
have
a
statement...
a
very
relevant
statement
that
the
prosecution
wants
to
use
to
prove
its
case.
a
statement
"i
dyed
my
hair
the
day
after
the
incident.
"
is
pretty
close.
that's
fairly
incriminating,
i
think.
justice
white
well,
of
course,
they
could
have...
the
police
i
suppose
could
have
found
out
what
color
his
hair
had
been.
