justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
the
impeachment
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
have
permits
the
prosecution
in
a
criminal
proceeding
to
introduce
evidence
illegally
obtained
from
the
defendant
to
impeach
the
defendant’s
own
testimony
if
he
takes
the
stand.
the
illinois
supreme
court
extended
this
exception,
in
this
case,
to
permit
the
prosecution
to
introduce
evidence
illegally
obtained
from
the
defendant
to
impeach
the
testimony
not
only
of
the
defendant
who
takes
the
stand,
but
also
of
other
witnesses
who
testify
for
the
defense
whether
or
not
the
defendant
takes
the
stand.
the
supreme
court
reasoned
that
in
order
to
deter
the
defendant
from
engaging
in
perjury
by
proxy,
the
impeachment
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
ought
to
be
expanded.
we
reverse.
we
hold
that
this
extension
is
inconsistent
with
a
balance
of
values
underlying
our
previous
applications
of
the
exclusionary
rule
expansion
of
the
exceptions
would
significantly
weaken
the
exclusionary
rules
to
deter
effect
and
police
misconduct
by
enhancing
the
expected
value
to
the
prosecution
of
an
illegally
obtained
evidence
by
deterring
defendants
from
calling
witnesses
in
the
first
place
and
thereby
keeping
exculpatory
evidence
from
the
jury.
when
police
officers
confront
opportunities
to
obtain
illegal
evidence,
excluding
such
evidence
from
only
the
prosecution’s
case
in
chief,
would
lead
officer
with
little
to
lose
and
much
to
gain
by
overstepping
the
constitutional
limits
on
evidence
gathered.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion
filed
this
day
with
the
clerk.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
kennedy
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
o’connor
and
scalia
have
joined.
