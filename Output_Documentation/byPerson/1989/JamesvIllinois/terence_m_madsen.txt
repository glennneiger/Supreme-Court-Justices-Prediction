mr.
terence
m.
madsen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
your
honors,
it
was
nearly
20
years
ago,
in
harris,
this
court
said
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
deterrent
effect
from
the
exclusionary...
exclusionary
rule,
sufficient
deterrence
flows
when
the
evidence
becomes
unavailable
for
the
state's
case
in
chief.
the
solicitor
general,
writing
as
amicus
for
the
state
in
this
case,
has
suggested
that
this
case
is
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
this
court
to
draw
that
as
the
bright
line,
and
your
honors,
the
people
of
illinois
agree
with
that
position.
your
honors,
there
are
two
steps
to
draw
that
line
that
must
be
taken.
first,
it's
the
step
from
direct
examination
of
the
defendant
to
direct
examination
of
a
witness
and
then
to
cross-examination
of
a
witness,
and
then
there's
also
the
related
step
of...
the
step
of
impeachment
to
rebuttal
evidence,
and,
your
honors,
in
terms
of
deterrent
effect,
those
steps
the
state
proposes
are
very,
very
small
steps.
your
honors,
look
to
a
policeman
trying
to
make
the
decision
whether
to
cross
the
threshold
or
not,
whether
to
ask
the
question
or
not.
he
doesn't
know
what
the
answer
is,
and...
but
he
does
know...
he
probably
doesn't
know
what
the
answer
is
going
to
be
or
what
he's
going
to
find,
but
what
does
he
know?
he
knows
that
whatever
he
gets
is
going
to
be
lost
to
him
for
the
case
in
chief
if
he
doesn't
take
the
time
to
do
it
right.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
virtually...
virtually
any
evidence
could
come
in
that
would
rebut--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--as
long...
your
honor,
it
would
be
as
long
as...
as
long
as
we
stayed
with...
with
conflict
only
and
not
required
the
contradiction
requirement
of
the
illinois
supreme
court,
which
is
another
consideration.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
you
would
have
to...
you
would
have
to
know...
you
would
have
to
know--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--without
the
protection
of
the
rule.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
your
question.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
your
honors,
i
don't...
it...
it
is
a
bright
line
and
it's
a
line
that
the
state
could
live
with,
but
i
don't
think,
when
it
comes
to
deterrent
ends,
and
we're
trying
to...
we're
drawing
the
line...
in
exclusionary
terms
and
drawing
the
line
for
deterrent
ends
and
what
it
means
to
the
police
officer,
if
we're
trying
to
deter
police
officers,
it
makes
no...
there's
no
sense
to
draw
the
line
there.
the...
the
incremental
difference
for
discouraging
the
police
officer
at
that
point
is...
is
too
small
for
the
cost
of...
to
the
truth-seeking
process.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
your
honor,
i
see...
i
see...
i
do
not
see
the
necessity
for
them.
i
do
see
the
reasons
for
those--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--i
would.
in
the
interest
of
the
truch-seeking
process,
i
would.
i
recognize,
however,
your
honor,
that
there
is
some
function
of...
of
not...
there
is
an
argument
to
be
made
that...
of
not
allowing
the
police...
or
the
prosecutor
to
do
that
which
the
police
officer
could
not
do
to
set
up,
to
bring
in
the
evidence,
but
we've
already
more
or
less
resolved
that
in
havens,
and
i
don't
think
it's
a
serious--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--your
honor--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--i
don't
know
what's
behind
that
and
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
requirement
that...
that's...
that
in
any
way
would...
in
fact,
that
would
be
perhaps
the
biggest
assault
to
the
truth-finding
process,
to
not
let
the...
not
let
the...
to
put
on
the
evidence
to
conflict
with,
"i
did
it".
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
it
would.
it
would,
your
honor,
and
that's...
i
think,
clearly,
that's
an
exception
that
illinois
has
adopted
that
i
have
to
live
with
but
you
should
not
make
the
rest
of
the
country
live
with
if
you
reach
that
point.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
it
is
harder
to...
to
extend
it
into
a
miranda
situation.
i
agree
with
that.
it's
more
difficult.
still,
the...
the
incentive
there
for
the...
the
police
officer
to
say,
we'll
lose
the
confession
and
possibly
the
fruits,
would
be...
would
still
be
a
great
risk
for
him
and
it's
a
risk
that
there's
no
incentive
to
take,
your
honors,
until
the
policeman
has
a
convincing
case.
when...
when
you
talk
of
what
the
officer
knows
is...
his
evidence
is
lost
for
his
case
in
chief.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
but
this
evidence--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--at
the
time
he
asked
the
questions.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because
at
the
take
time
he
asked
the
question
here,
he
didn't
even
have
enough
evidence
for
probable
cause,
let
alone
to
take
the
trial
to
begin
to
assert
guilt.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
your
honors,
for...
a
police
officer
will
take...
will
get
eventually
to
take
the
stand,
if
a
defendant
now
presents
conflicting
evidence
in
his
case
in
chief
or
conflicting
evidence
on
his
cross-examination.
the
police
officer
will
get
to
take
the
stand
and
if...
if
we
extend
here
to
direct...
and
i
think
certainly,
your
honors,
what...
what
a
defense
witness...
or,
what
a
defendant
does
through
a
witness
is
clearly
attributable
to
him.
the
court
cannot
allow
a
defendant
to
use
a
witness
to
say
the
things
that
it
will
not
allow
him
to
say
himself.
and
what
the
police
officer
knows
now
is
he...
he'll
eventually
take
the
stand
if
the
contradiction
comes
in
and
he'll
say,
defendant
had
the
gun,
or
told
me
he
had
the
gun,
or
i
found
the
gun
on
defendant.
well,
your
honors,
from
a
police
officer's
point
of
view,
the
people
submit,
it
really
makes
little
difference
to
them
whether
at
the
point
of...
after
the
state's
case
in
chief,
after
the
directed
verdict's
been
passed,
after
there's
sufficient
evidence
for
guilt,
whether
they
get
to
take
the
stand
and
tell
the
jury,
he
had
the
gun,
and
the
jury
was
later
instructed
that
this
is
impeachment,
or
they
get
to
tell
the
jury
he
had
the
gun,
and
the
jury
is
later
instructed
this
is
a
rebuttal.
to
that
police
officer,
when
he's
standing
on
that
threshold
making
the
decision,
it's
not
going
to
make
much
difference
to
him.
it's
not
the
kind
of
analysis
he's
going
to
undertake.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
see,
your
honor,
i
think
for
the
bulk,
though...
and
as
the
court
recognized
in
harris,
for
the
bulk
of
police
work,
a
policeman's
job
building
a
case
is
to
gather
evidence,
and
it's
to
gather
admissible
evidence,
and
to
say--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--you're
speaking--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--you're
speaking
of
extending
past
the
situation
here
to
miranda.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
yes.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
well,
they
don't...
they...
they
would
be
able
to
use
it
to
rebut
whatever...
what
was...
was
inconsistent
with
it.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
but,
your
honor,
putting...
giving
the
officer
the...
taking
away
the
evidence
from
the
officer,
from
the
case
in
chief,
and
making
whatever
it
is...
whatever
the
evidence
is
that
he's
going
to
get,
it's
got
to
be
unimportant
enough
that
he's
willing
to
sacrifice
it
for
the
case
in
chief
and--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--he
wouldn't
have
it...
he
wouldn't
have
it
anyway,
but
the
defendant
also...
or,
if
he
did
eventually
have
it
the
defendant
wouldn't
be
able
to
put
on,
under
the
shield
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
that
evidence,
and
that's
what...
that's
what
the
offset
here
is,
and
we
can't
say
that
where...
where...
to
the
extent
the
policemen
want
to
reach
that
little
beyond
what
they
need
for
their
case
in
chief,
or...
there's
no
incentive.
there's
really
no
incentive,
unless
you
have
a
very
strong
case
and
you're
lazy,
to
go
after...
to
not
do
it
right,
and
it's
not
correct
to
presume
that
the
police
will
not
do
it
right.
your
honors,
the
people...
the...
the
state
could
live,
as
it
were,
with
the...
with
the
extension
of
this
case
to
direct
evidence,
and
if
it
is
direct
evidence
we
recognize
that
there...
that
assures...
there
are
safeguards
that
assures
the
defendants'
using
this
shield--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--i
guess
they
sought...
well,
your
honor,
remember,
too,
a
lot
of
the
dissent,
there
is
this
impeachment
question
and
what
exactly
the
nature
of
this
evidence
is.
but...
but,
your
honors,
there
is
no
reason
that...
that
petitioner
can
espouse
that
this
court
should
allow
a
defendant
to
say
to
a
witness
that
which
he
cannot
say
through
himself,
at
a
bare
minimum.
there
is
no
reason
for
that.
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
address
very
briefly
the
question
of
impeachment
and
what
the
nature
of
this
evidence
is.
your
honors,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
this
is
impeachment
because
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
said
its
impeachment.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
i
understand
that,
your
honor--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--and
through
the
state's
briefs
in
the
courts
below,
the
state
at...
at
one
point
interchanged
impeachment
and
rebuttal,
but
clearly,
in
the
state's
reply
brief...
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
made
clear...
that
they
were
trying
to
get
the
court
to
accept
the
theory
of
rebuttal
evidence
in
this
case.
and
if
this
is
in
fact
impeachment,
then
it
does
change
the...
the
entire
posture
of
what
we're
trying
to
deal
with
here.
but
i
believe,
your
honors,
that
you
could
recognize--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--i
think,
as
a
matter
of...
of
what
the
illinois
supreme
court's
done
with
state
law,
i
don't
know
how
you
can
call
it
something
else.
i
think
you
can
say
that
it's
not
what
you...
i
think
you
can
say
that
it's
not
what
you
had
in
mind
in
the
walder
line
of
cases,
that
use,
and
i
think
that
you
can
say
that
you
wouldn't
call
it
impeachment
and
i'm
not
sure
that
other
jurisdictions
would
call
it
impeachment,
and
i
don't
know
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
would
do
with
it
again
under
the
same
circumstances.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
your
honor,
i...
i
agree.
i'm
not
sure
there
are
many
jurisdictions...
i'm
not
sure
there's
another
jurisdiction
that
would
say
this
is
impeachment
in
this
particular...
in
this
particular
instance,
but
my
court
has
told
me
it's
impeachment
and
i
suppose
that
if
you
say
well,
to
the
extent
that
he
said
it,
it
may
tend
to
discredit
her,
just
that
he
at
some
earlier
point
said
it.
you
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
believe
him.
now,
if...
if
you
didn't
believe
him,
impeachment
would
fail.
but
you
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
believe
him
to
call
into
question
her
credibility.
but
that's...
that's
the
only
approach
we've
been
able
to
see
to
even
begin
to
support
this
as
impeachment,
but
i
don't
see
how
this
court
can
interfere
with
what
the...
the
state
of
illinois
has...
has
called...
but
the
label
makes
no
difference.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
we've
not.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
it
is.
to
my
knowledge...
to
my
recollection,
your
honor.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
i
think,
your
honor,
that's
the
point.
what
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
labeled
this
for
purposes
of
illinois
evidentiary
law
is
a
different
question
from
what...
what
you
need
to
face,
and
i
think
that's
an
easy
way
to
address
that
question,
and
i
think,
your
honors,
that
if
you
take
that
approach
to
this
question,
then
that
will
give
you
the
solution
and
avoid
the
business
of,
there's...
if
you
look
at
this
as
impeachment
and
try
and
address
it
from
that,
there's
a
waiver
of
the
first
instruction,
there's
two
harmless
error
analyses
in
this
opinion,
and
the
much
easier
course
to
take
would
be
that
course.
your
honors,
illinois
asks
you
to
accept--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--rebuttal.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
rebuttal.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
to
the
extent
that
it's
proper
for
rebuttal.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
it's
just...
it's
just
as
damaging
either
way,
and
it's
just
as
damaging
whether
it
comes
from
the
mouth
of
the
defendant
or
from
the
mouth
of
one
of
his
witnesses,
and
i
submit
either
on
cross
or
direct,
but
certainly
on
direct.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
not...
he...
he
loses...
not...
your
honor...
he
loses
it...
he
does
not
lose
it
any...
you've
already
made
that
determination,
your
honors,
in
walder
and
harris.
i
guess...
i
guess
if
we
say
he
does,
that
the
determination
has
already
been
made,
and
in
balancing
the
exclusionary
rule
the...
you've
already
decided
that
the
deterrent
ends
of
that
aren't
well
met
by...
by
allowing
that
to
happen.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
no,
i'm
afraid
you
were
in
dissent,
your
honor.
i'm
afraid...
i'm
sorry,
i'm
speaking
of
you
collectively.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
that's
true,
your
honor.
you
can't...
you
can't
put
on
a
second
case
in
chief.
it
has
to
be
related
to
what
the
defendant
puts
on.
but
all
we
do
is,
we
have
protection
of
this
evidence
and
we
move...
all
we're
doing
is
shifting...
making
the
person
whose...
whose
court
it
is
in,
as...
as
we
say,
responsible
for
the
use
of...
for
how
that
evidence
comes
in
or
not.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
it
will,
but
if
the
confession
were
properly
admitted...
it
were
legally
taken,
there...
the
confession
would
be
there.
it's
not
a
question
of
voluntary--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--your
honor,
could
i
ask...
if
you're
talking
in
terms
of
"i
did
it"--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--then
that's
different
also
from
a
statement
like
the
one
in
this
case...
i
had
brown
hair.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
and
that
would
be...
while
that
is
the
one
thing
that
would
make
it
difficult
for
him
to
put
on
evidence
against,
that
also
is
the
highest
price
we
pay
for
the
exclusionary
rule,
because
that's
"i
did
it",
and
then
allowing
the
evidence
to
put
in...
the
defendant
to
put
in
evidence
that
thwarts
the
truth-seeking
process
that
"i
did
it"
and
that's
the
highest
price...
price
we
pay,
and...
and
it's
too
high
on
the
speculation
that
police
are
not
going
to
take
the
time
to
do
it
right
to
get...
to
get
the
statement
that's
admissible
in
the
first
place.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
it's
not
a
confession
case.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
it
is
incriminating
that
he
dyed
his
hair
the
day
after
the
incident
and
it's
certainly
important
to
the
case.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
well
that's...
thank
you,
your
honor.
thank
you,
your
honor.
your
honors--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--i'm
not
sure
that
it
was
necessary
to
do
it,
but
it
added
nothing
to
the
statement.
obviously,
if
he
was
there
and
he
said
he
had--
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
--but
he
had
had
his
hair
changed
there,
that
he
went
there
to
get
his
hair
changed.
it
shows
that
he
said
he
had.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
at
least...
at
least
that.
your
honor,
as
far
as
the
policeman
is
concerned,
the
evidence
is
lost
if
he
loses
it,
unless
the
defendant
does
something
to
allow
it
to
come
back
in,
and
a
policeman
is
not
in
a
position
to
try
to
work
out
the
legalities
that
the
seven
judges
below,
or
the
seven...
ten
judges
below,
and
you,
and
judge
pincham
in
the
trial
court,
are
trying
to
make
when
they're
trying
to
decide
whether
to
cross
the
threshold
or
whether
to
ask
the
question,
and
your
honors,
i
submit
that
an
order
from
the
chief
is
going
to
be,
gather
admissible
evidence,
and
that's
the
point
that
this
court
should
work
from.
your
honors,
it's
for
all
these
reasons
that
the
people
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
mr.
terence
m.
madsen
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
may
have
aided
their
probable
cause
argument,
but
that's
the
point.
they
didn't
do
that,
among
other
things.
the
evidence
is
not
set
out,
but
the
arrest
was
based
on...
two
boys
on
the
street
came
by
and
said,
we
heard
rumors
that
romeo,
who
the
police
said
was
the
petitioner's
nickname,
may
have
done
this.
and
based
on
that,
they
went
and
picked
him
up.
i
think
it's
pretty
clear,
as
the
trial
court
found,
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
here
and
the
police
couldn't
have
believed
that
they
had
probable
cause.
so
this...
i
think
this
rule
would
both
encourage
carelessness,
but
i
think
it
would
also
encourage
deliberate
violations
of
fourth
amendment
rights.
as...
as
far
as,
again,
whether
a
police
officer
has
to
sit
down
and
think
this
through,
i
don't
think
that's
true.
i
think
the
message
will
be
that
the
restrictions
on
the
use
of
this
kind
of
evidence
have
been
greatly
relaxed.
it's...
it'll
be
valuable
to
us
to
get
it,
so
if
you
can't
get
it
another
way,
and
especially,
as
in
this
case,
if
the
prospect
of
having
independent
evidence
is
very
high,
where
you
know
you
have
several
eyewitnesses,
then
i
think
that
the...
the
deterrent,
or
the
incentive,
is
there
and
i
think
i'll
close
with
that,
unless
the
court
has
any
other
questions.
