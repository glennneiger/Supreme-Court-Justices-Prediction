justice
kennedy
well,
why
is
it
any
different
than
havens?
havens
was
the
t-shirt
case.
justice
kennedy
where
the
defendant
has
assisted
his
accomplice
by
cutting
up
his
t-shirt
to
make
an
extra
pocket
in
the...
in
the
drug
courier
and
then
he
puts
the
torn-up
t-shirt
in
his
own
luggage.
how
can
you
possibly
say
that
in...
in
that
case,
it
was
used
only
for
impeachment,
and
that
in
this
case,
it
cannot...
the
statement
cannot
be
used
only
for
impeachment?
i
don't
understand
the
difference
in
the...
in
the
case.
justice
kennedy
right.
physical
evidence
is
more...
is
more
difficult,
isn't
it?
the
t-shirt's
there
for
the
jury
to
see.
they're
staring
at
it.
justice
kennedy
no,
but
it's
accompanied...
it's
accompanied
by
an
assertion
of
the
police
officer
that
the
t-shirt
was
found
in
the
luggage.
justice
kennedy
what
you're
telling
us
that
you
can't
distinguish
the
two.
i'm
saying,
how
could
you
distinguish
the
two
in
havens.
justice
kennedy
so,
you're
saying
havens
is
wrong?
justice
kennedy
well,
in
fact
here
there
was
the
additional
statement
that
he
went
to
the
beauty
parlor
in
order
to
change
his
hair
color.
was
it
necessary
to
introduce
that?
justice
kennedy
well,
it
showed
a
guilty
mind.
justice
kennedy
it
showed
it
was
voluntary.
nobody
threw
him
into
the
chair
and
started
changing
his
hair
color,
right?
