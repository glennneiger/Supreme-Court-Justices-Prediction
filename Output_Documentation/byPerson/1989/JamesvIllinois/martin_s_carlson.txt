mr.
martin
s.
carlson
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
statements
obtained
from
a
defendant
as
a
result
of
an
arrest
made
without
probable
cause
may
be
used
substantively
as
an
admission
to
rebut
the
testimony
of
a
defense
witness.
mr.
james,
the
petitioner,
was
found
guilty
of
murder
and
attempted
murder
arising
out
of
a
shooting
incident
in
chicago.
and
the
following
day,
the
day
after
the
shooting,
he
was
arrested
by
two
police
officers
with...
without
a
warrant
and
taken
to
a
squad
car
where
he
was
questioned
concerning
the
color
of
his
hair.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
well,
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
was
that
he
was
discovered
under
a
hair
dryer.
his
statement
to
the
police,
which
the
trial
court
excluded
as
having
been
the
fruit
of
the
unlawful
arrest,
his
oral
statement
was
to
the
effect
that
he
was
there
to
get
his
hair
dyed
black
and
curled.
at
trial
the
state
presented
five
members
of
the
group
who
were
with
the
deceased
and
the
other
shooting
victim.
they
were
all
friends
and
they
all
identified
petitioner
as
having
been
the...
the
third
man
in
the
other
group
and
the
one
who
was
the
shooter.
they
also
all
testified
that
at
the
time
of
the
shooting--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--yes,
sir.
they
also
testified
that
at
the
time
of
the
shooting
petitioner
was
wearing
what
they
called
a
butter-style
hair...
hair
which
is
a
slicked
back
hair,
reddish-brown
in
color.
that
was
the
substance
of
the
state's
case,
was
the
eyewitness
testimony.
for
the
defense,
in
addition
to
presenting
a
police
officer
who
had
interviewed
some
of
the
eye
witnesses
and
who
related
certain
prior
inconsistent
statements,
petitioner
called
a
friend
of
the
family
named
jewel
henderson,
who
testified
that
on
the
day
of
the...
shooting
she
had
taken
petitioner
to
a
high
school
to
transfer,
to
pick
up
his
transcripts
and
to
register
at
another
high
school
and
on
that
day
his
hair
was,
in
fact,
black
and
among
other
things
he
was
not
wearing
an
earring,
also.
that
was
also
testified
to
by
the
state's
other
eyewitnesses.
at
this
point,
the
prosecution
asked
the
court,
or
announced
to
the
court
that
it
wished
to
use
petitioner's
suppressed
statements
for
the
purpose
of,
as
it
was
erroneously
called,
impeaching
or
rebutting
miss
henderson's
testimony.
defense
counsel
objected
on
fourth
amendment
grounds,
calling,
of
course,
attention
to
the
fact
that
this
court's
decisions
had
only
allowed
the
use
of
tainted
evidence
to
impeach
the
testimony
of
the
defendant
himself.
the
trial
court
rejected
that
argument
but
did
hold
a
voluntariness
hearing
at
which
the
two
arresting
officers
testified,
and
having
found
the
statements
to
have
been
voluntary,
the
court
ruled
that
they
could
be
used,
as
he
put
it,
to
impeach
and
rebut
miss
henderson's
testimony.
thereafter,
officer...
officer
glynn,
one
of
the
arresting
officers
testified
and
related,
in
essence
that
in
the
squad
car
he
asked
the
defendant
what
his
hair
color
was
the
day
before
and
mr.
james
responded
that
it
was
reddishbrown
and
combed
straight
back.
later,
approximately
two
hours,
i
believe,
at
the
police
station,
he
was
interrogated
again
and
at
that
point,
he
reiterated
that
the
color
was
brown
and
he
also
was
asked
what...
what
he
was
doing
at
the
beauty
parlor,
and
according
to
the
detective
respondent...
or
petitioner
stated
he
was
there
to
get
his
hair
dyed
black
and
curled
to
change
his
appearance,
and
all
of
those
statements
were...
were
used...
were
presented
to
the
jury
in
rebuttal.
counsel
for
petitioner
requested
a
limiting
instruction
to
the
effect
that
these
statements
could
not
be
used
as
evidence
of
guilt,
but
only
as
bearing
on
the
credibility
of
miss
henderson.
the
trial
court
refused
the
written
instruction
tendered
by
the
defense
but
did
give
an
oral
instruction
which
in
effect
said
that
this
testimony
was
offered
to
prove
that
his
hair
was
black...
i'm
sorry,
was
red.
on
appeal
the
illinois
appellate
court
reversed
primarily
based
on--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--it
definitely
was
not
limiting.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
definitely.
i
could...
he
didn't
mention
the
word
"impeaching",
but
the
instruction
read,
it's
"offered
for
the
purpose
of
impeaching
the
testimony
of
miss
henderson,
who
stated
to
you
that
the
defendant's
hair
was
black.
"
but
then
it
continued,
"this
evidence
is
offered
to
refute
and
rebut
that
testimony,
that
it
was
not
black,
but
it
was
red,
at
the
point
the
officer
said
the
defendant
told
him
it
was
red.
"
i
mean
that's
just
saying,
in
effect--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--no,
our
position
is--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--that
it
would
be
impossible,
that
even
the
instruction
tendered
by
defense
counsel
could
not
have
done
the
job.
this
kind
of
impeachment,
if
you
will,
is
really
rebuttal.
it
is
designed
to
disprove--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--that...
that
would
not...
that
would
have
solved
the
problem
of
it
being
used
for
its
assertive
value.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
well,
no.
i
believe
we
would
have
still
been
here,
because
i
think
the...
the
instruction
intended
by
defense
counsel
was
a
really
totally
damage
control,
or
last
resort.
his
objection
was
to
the
admission
of
the
statement,
and
when
the
court
repeatedly
overruled
that
objection,
which
was
made
several
times
during
lengthy
hearings,
he
said
well
then,
at
least
you've
got
to
give
me
a
limiting
instruction.
but
i
don't
believe
that,
given
the...
the
logical
basis
of
this
kind
of
impeachment,
of...
of
contradiction,
that
you
can
tell
a
jury
that
a
witness
will
be
discredited
unless
you
also
tell
them
that
they've
to
believe
the
truth
of
the
matter
asserted
in
the
impeaching
or
rebutting
evidence.
so,
our...
our
position
is
that
you
can
no
way
you
can
logically,
or...
or...
or
give
an
instruction
to
the
jury
that
would
make
any
sense
as
a
matter
of
logic,
that
they
could
follow
and
that
that
could
be
effective
in
preventing--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--well,
i
think
if
you
just
said
impeach,
i'm
not
sure
the
jury
would
understand
that.
i
think
if--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--to
discredit
or
to...
as
it
bears
on
the
credibility
of
the
witness,
is
the
general
one
in
illinois.
well
the
problem
with
that
is
that
it
will
bear
on
the
credibility
only
if
they
believe
the
defendant's
statement
is
true,
if
they
believe
it
for
its
substantive
value.
so,
to
say
that
they
can
consider
it
only
for
a
purpose
that
is
nonsubstantive,
but
when
it's...
when
it's
obvious
that
purpose
requires
substantive
use,
like
i
say,
is
logically...
it
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
as
the...
the
dissenting
opinions
in
the
illinois
supreme
court...
i
think
the
problem
in
the
illinois
supreme
court,
was
their
failure
to
recognize
the
majority
opinion,
that
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
contradiction,
not
self-contradiction.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
certainly,
but
the
problem
is,
what
does
have
constitutional
magnitude
is
whether
unlawfully
seized
evidence
is
being
used
to
prove
a
defendant's
guilt...
as
substantive
evidence
of
guilt.
this
court
has
never,
outside
of
the
good-faith
cases,
has
never
allowed
at
trial
evidence
obtained
unlawfully
from...
from
a
defendant
to
be
used
to
prove
his
guilt.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
no,
they
did...
did
not,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
no,
but
that
was
the
alternative
argument
that
we
had
made.
what
they
held
was,
there
is
no
error
in
admitting
the
statements
and
that
any
error
in
the
limiting
instructions
or
in
the
closing
argument
was
harmless.
but
their...
their...
their
basic
holding
was
that
there
was
no
error
in
admitting
the
statements
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
no.
no,
again,
they
did
not
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
admission
of
the
statements
was
harmless.
they
only
said
that,
assuming
that
was
proper,
any
error
in
limiting
instructions
or
closing
argument
was
harmless.
the
illinois
appellate
court
did
address
that
question.
they
held
that
it
was...
i'll
say
not
harmless
there
in
their
opinion,
but
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
address
that
question.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
yes,
but
i
think
that's,
again,
it's
our
position
and
i
think
the
position
of
the
dissenting
position
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
was
that
the
majority
overlooked
the
fact
that
there...
this
is
not
like
the
case
you
had
in
havens
or
walder
or
harris...
or
harris.
that
you
could
not
use...
you
could
not
impeach
by
contradiction
and
not
use
it
for
its
assertive
value.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
it
isn't
as
clear
cut
in
the
case
of
physical
evidence
as
it
is
in
the
case
of
unlawfully
obtained
statements.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
but
it's
not
assertive.
it's,
at
most,
circumstantial.
furthermore,
i
think
that
the
real
impeachment
in
havens--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--right,
but
that...
that
was
not
a
direct
proof
of
the
fact
that
he
was
involved
in
the
cocaine...
it
was
a
bit
of
evidence,
and
yes,
it
could
be
used
substantively--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--well,
this
court
did,
but
i...
i
think--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--no,
i'm
saying
that
havens
was
predicated
on
the
assumption
that
the
instruction
in
that
case
could
effectively
tell
the
jury
not
to
use
it
as
evidence
of
guilt.
i
mean,
the
court
held
that
the
evidence
was
not
admissible
as
substantive
evidence
of
guilt.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
no,
that's
true,
there...
there
have
been--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--well,
i
think--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--well,
the
court
in
this
case
thought
that
the
instruction
given
by
the
trial
court...
the
oral
instruction,
in
conjunction,
if...
and
they
didn't
even
acknowledge
that
it
may
have
been
erroneous...
in
conjunction
with
the
standard
illinois
instruction
on
impeachment
by
self-contradiction
was
adequate,
and
that...
if...
if...
they
said
if
it
wasn't,
it
was
harmless.
but
getting
back
to
the
issue
of
physical
evidence,
i
think,
again,
that...
that...
it...
it's
not
as
clear-cut.
i
can't
deny
that.
but
i
don't
think...
it
will
be
a
rare
case,
i
think,
indeed,
when
you...
when
you
would
be
able
to
impeach
a
defense
witness
with
physical
evidence.
it's
hard
to
conceive
in
the
abstract
of
a
case
where
physical
evidence
could
somehow
be
inconsistent
with
something
that
a
defense
witness
said
as
opposed
to
what
a
defendant
might
have
said,
because
generally
it
is
seized
from
the
defendant,
from
his
premises
or
whatever,
and
oftentimes
it
just
won't
be
there.
it
just
won't
be
relevant
to
their
testimony.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
well,
our
position
is
that
the
danger,
or
what's
wrong
with
that
is
the...
is
the
deterrent
function
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
that
it
would
add
significant
incentive
to
the
police
to
make
a
lot
more
arrests.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
well,
this
was
a
fourth
amendment
case.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
well,
i...
i...
i
think
that
based
on...
as
this
court
always
has,
it's
based
its...
its
determinations
on
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
and
its
assumptions
on
police
conduct,
and
here
we're
dealing
with
the
core...
the
center
of
the
officer's
attention
is,
his
zone
of
primary
interest,
the
criminal
trial.
it
seems
to
me
that,
as
this
court
held
in
brown
and
dunaway
in
the
unlawful
arrest
statement
cases,
that
there
is
indeed
a
need
to
deter
seizures
for
investigation,
seizures
on
bare
suspicion,
which
i
think
is
what
we
had
here.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
well,
our...
our
position
is,
that...
that's
what
we...
that
as
the
law
now
stands,
the
vast
majority
of
authority
is
that
you
can
only
use
tainted
statements
to
impeach
the
defendant's
own
testimony.
now,
granted...
granted
that
there
will
always
be
the
deterrent
of
the
bar
in
chief,
but
if...
if
the
state...
if
the
officers
feel
that...
that
they
would
be
able
to
have
independent
evidence
to
get
past
the
restricted
finding,
i
think
the
value
to
them
of...
of,
under
this
new
rule
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
would
be--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--that...
that's
correct,
the
illinois
supreme
court--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--that's
true,
but--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--i
think,
again,
if
the
police
are
seeking
an
admission
and
they've
got
a
broad
admission,
it
would
be
virtually
impossible
for
the
defendant
to
put
on
any
kind
of
a
defense
without
being
inconsistent.
i
mean,
that...
that's...
that's
the
incentive,
and...
and
in
addition,
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
it's
not
only
the
use
of
the
evidence
that
would
be
of
value,
it's...
the
actual
use...
it's
the
fact
that
the
police
would
see
it
as
a
means
of...
of
tying
the
defendant's
hands
and
enhancing
the
chances
of
convictions
by
deterring
the
defense
from
putting
any...
any
evidence
on
at
all,
and--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--there's
no
question
about
it
that
any
time
you
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
you
are
not
furthering
the
goal
of
truth.
the
question
always
is,
are
you
furthering
the
goal
of--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--well,
the
fourth
amendment
interests
here.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
that's
true,
but
i
think
in
the
case
of--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--well,
not
in
the
case
of
statements.
i
think,
generally
speaking,
a
defendant's
statements
are
not
generally
essential
to
the
state's
case
in
chief,
certainly.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
well,
i'm
talking
about
legally
obtained
statements.
it
would
also
apply
to
physical
evidence,
but
again,
i
think
that
would
be
a
much
more
unusual
situation
where
that
would
ever
come
about.
but
in...
in
this
very
case,
the
police
officers
knew
when
they
took
mr.
james
into
custody
that
there
were
several
eye
witnesses
to
the
offense
and
that
if
they
ever...
if
they
ever
found
the
right
person
they
would
probably
get
identifications
and
they
wouldn't
need
the
statement.
and
the
first...
the
first
question
they
asked
him,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
was
what
was
the
color
of
his
hair,
and
i
think
that
was
clearly...
they...
they
were
trying
to
get
statements
that
would
conform
to
what
they
knew
of
the
offense
already.
the
danger
is
that...
we
don't
maintain
that
the
police
would
have
to
think
specifically
about
what
possible
specific
testimony
might
be
given
that
it
might
be
useful
for.
it's
just
the
overall
message
that
if...
if
you
adopt
this
rule,
that
now
we
can
use
unlawfully
obtained
statement
or
physical
evidence,
i...
i
suppose
would
apply
to
miranda
violations
as
well,
whenever
the
defendant
puts
on
any
kind
of
inconsistent
evidence
in
his
defense.
and
again,
it's
not
based
on
a
right
to
do
so,
but
if
the
police
perceive
a
value
to
it
i
think
that's,
as
this
court
has
held,
you
look
at
the
common
sense
assumptions
on
their
behavior.
furthermore,
i...
i
think
one
further
ramification
of
this
rule
is
if
the
court
does
approve
the...
use...
the
substantive
use
in
rebuttal
i
don't
see
how
that
could
not
apply
to
the
defendant's
own
testimony
and
therefore
that
under
the...
the
requirement
of
harris
and
havens
that
there
be
written
instructions,
i
don't
think
it
would
any
longer
really
apply.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
that's
right,
you're
using
it
for
rebuttal
for
proof
of...
of
facts
in
the
case.
so
again,
the
expansion
of
the
use
of
unlawfully
obtained
evidence,
both
in
terms
of
who
it
will
apply
to
and
also
its
use,
i
think
is
not
a
small
step
here,
it's
a
major
step
and
i
think
is...
is...
is
one
this
court
should...
should
not
sanction.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
unless
there
are
any
further
questions.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
i
don't
know
if
i
misunderstood
justice
scalia's
comments
on...
on...
he
saw
the
danger
more
in
terms
of
miranda
than
in
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment,
but
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
is
really
a
derivative
miranda.
this
was
an
unlawful
arrest
for
the
purposes
of
interrogation,
so
that
it
was
getting
him...
it
was...
the
arrest
was
the
vehicle
by
which
the
police
could
then
obtain
the
statement
that
they
would
lose
without...
without
the...
having
done
the
illegality.
so,
i
think
in
the
case
of
physical
evidence
perhaps
that's
correct,
but
certainly
in
the
case
of
dunaway-type
violations,
where
it's
an
investigative
arrest
for
the
purpose
of
interrogation,
i
think
that
the
incentive
is
definitely
there.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
that's
correct.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
well,
i
think
the...
the
trial
itself
was
not
that--
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
--it
was
delayed
in
the
appellate
court...
it
took
the
appellate
court,
i
believe
over
a
year,
or
a
year
and
a
half,
to
decide
the
case
after
oral
argument
and
for
them
to
explain
it.
mr.
martin
s.
carlson
they're
not
that
bad.
they're
bad,
but
not
that
bad.
this
was
unusual.
