chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-6075,
darryl
james
v.
illinois.
we'll
wait
just
a
moment,
mr.
carlson.
very
well,
mr.
carlson,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
carlson,
could
you
slow
down
a
little
bit?
i
think
some
of
us
are
having
a
little
trouble
understanding
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think...
mr.
carlson,
do
you
think
the
trial
court's
oral
instruction
was
or
was
not
the
equivalent
of
an
instruction
to
use
it
only
for
determining
credibility?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
it
was...
the...
the
trial
court
allowed
it,
in
its
instruction,
to
be
used
for,
in
effect,
rebuttal,
to
be
considered
substantively?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
at...
at
least
you
would
have
a
different
question
here,
if
that
instruction
had
been
than,
in
your
view,
you
have
now?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that
an
instruction
saying
that
the
defendant's
statements
were
introduced
only
to
impeach
the
defense
witness'
testimony
would...
would
have,
what,
made
no
sense?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
say
to
discredit.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
of
course,
those
aren't
constitutional
principles
themselves,
you
know,
the
law
of
evidence
and
the
circumstances
under
which
you
can
impeach
a
witness
and
what...
what
they
generally
don't
have
any
constitutional
basis.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
carlson,
i
suppose
it's
evident
to
you
that
beginning
with
the
walder
case
in
1947,
the
harris
case
in
1971,
the
havens
case
sometime
in
early
'80s,
the
court
has
gradually
expanded
the
use
that
has
been
permitted
of
this
sort
of
statement.
and
what
great
difference
does
it
make,
other
than
another
step
of
expansion,
if
we
were
to
say
here
that
so
long
as
the
government
doesn't
use
it
in
its
case
in
chief,
it's
perfectly
permissible
to
use
it
substantively?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do...
do...
do...
do
you
think
fewer
miranda
warnings
would
be
given
if...
if...
if
that
rule
came
from
this
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
few...
fewer...
fewer...
less
attention...
less
attention
paid
to
the
law
regarding
searches
and
seizures?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
why...
why
would
it
be
inadequate
deterrence
to
say
that
it
extends
only
to
the
government's
case
in
chief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
if...
if
the
goal
of
a
criminal
trial
is
to
try
to
find
the
truth,
certainly
this
would
enhance
that
goal.
chief
justice
rehnquist
some
other
value.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
it
wouldn't,
because
you're
not
using
it
just
for
impeachment
any
longer.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
carlson.
mr.
madsen?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there's
a
great
body
of
evidentiary
law
that
says,
you
know,
if
you
call
a
witness
to
contradict
another
witness,
that
that
is
not
impeachment.
you
know,
if...
if...
if...
if...
you're
talking
here
not
about
the
statement
of
a
defendant
but
the
statement
of
another
witness
and
you
called
that
witness
to
the
stand,
you...
you
would
not
allow...
you...
you
can't
impeach
a
witness
on
a
collateral
matter,
they
say,
so
that
the
testimony
of
the
second
witness
has
to
be
material
to
the...
to
the
issues
being
considered
by
the
jury,
which
this
would
qualify
as.
but
i
think
very
few
jurisdictions
would
say
that
was
impeachment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
doesn't
rebuttal
itself
have
some
limitations
in
most
states?
that
is,
it
has
to
be
a...
a
response
to
something
adduced
by
the
defense.
the
case...
the
state
can't
just
sandbag
its
case
in
chief
and
decide
to
suddenly
complement
that
at
rebuttal.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
presumably
the
state
isn't
going
to
be
interested
in
any
statements
that
aren't
incriminating.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
madsen.
mr.
carlson,
you
have
ten
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
carlson.
the
case
is
submitted.
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-6075,
james
versus
illinois
will
be
announced
by
justice
brennan.
