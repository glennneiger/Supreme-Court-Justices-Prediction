justice
scalia
i...
i
must
say,
what...
what
you
say
about
the
negligible
effect
on
deterrence
is
a...
is
a
lot
truer
with
respect
to
fourth
amendment
violations
than
with
respect
to...
confessions
unlawfully
obtained.
it
seems
to
me
the
police
officer
knows
very
well
that
if
he...
if
he
asks
the
person
under
arrest,
does
he...
does
he
want
a
lawyer,
and
tells
him
you
don't
have
to
answer
any
questions
if
you
have
a
lawyer,
he
knows
doggone
well
that
as
soon
as
he
gets
a
lawyer
the
lawyer's
going
to
tell
him,
don't
answer
any
questions.
so
he
has
nothing
to
lose.
trick...
trick
him
out
of
a
confession
right
away.
you
wouldn't
get
a
confession
if
you
did
it
right
so
why
not
do
it...
do
it
this
way?
what...
what's
to
lose?
isn't
that
the
reality
of
the
thing?
i
mean,
the
fourth
amendment
is...
is
something
different,
but
as
far
as...
as
far
as
confessions
go--
justice
scalia
but
at
least
when
you're
dealing
with
a
confession,
that
is
always
going
to
relate
to
whatever
the
defendant
puts
on,
because
whatever
he
puts
on,
it...
it
will
go
to
establish
the
point
that
he
did
not
commit
the
crime,
and
if
you
have
a
confession
that
will
always
be
able
to
come
in,
as
far
as
relevance
is
concerned,
isn't
that
right?
as
far
as
being
properly
in
response
to
what
was
in
the
case
in
chief?
wouldn't
a
confession
always
come
in?
justice
scalia
no,
i
understand;
it...
it...
it
doesn't
blow
your
case
away,
but
just
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question...
in
fourth
amendment
violations
i
can
understand
how
very
often
you
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
something
in
unless
he
had
specifically
said
that
the...
the
t-shirt
wasn't
in
the
luggage
and
you
show
it
was
in
the
luggage,
or
something
like
that.
but
as
far
as
a
confession
is
concerned,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the...
if
the
defendant
puts
on
any
kind
of
a
defense,
you're
going
to
be
able
to
respond
by
introducing
his
confession.
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
okay.
you're
right.
i...
i'm
talking
about
the
"i
did
it"
confession.
