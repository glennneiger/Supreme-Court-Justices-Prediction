justice
stevens
mr.
madsen,
does
that
really
make
any
difference
if...
if
the
defendant
puts
in
a
defense?
that
would
make
a
big
difference,
of
course,
if
the
defendant
doesn't
put
on
any
defense,
but
if
you
have
any
substantive
evidence
that
tends
to
prove
guilt,
would
it
not
always
be
admittable...
admissible
on
rebuttal
if
he
put
on
some
defense
of
alibi,
or
just...
any
defense,
if
you
draw
the
bright
line?
justice
stevens
so
that
your
bright
line
would
just
really
give
effect
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
only
in
those
cases
in
which
no...
the
defendant
didn't
put
on
a
defense.
justice
stevens
--you'd
have
to
have
a
prima
facie
case
without
that
evidence,
right.
you
would
have
to
know
that
you
would
have
to
put
the
case
in
as...
as
the
evidence
existed
and
without
the
protection
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
and
also,
you
can't...
on
your
case
in
chief
you
not
only
can't
use
that
evidence,
but
you
can't
use
any
of
its
fruits
on
your
case
in
chief,
right?
justice
stevens
--that's
certainly
not
true
in
this
case.
there
was
something
like
four
or
five
eyewitnesses,
weren't
there?
weren't
there
several
eyewitnesses
here?
justice
stevens
yes,
and
this
evidence,
he
had
nothing
to
lose
by
asking
him
everything
he
could
think
of,
did
he?
justice
stevens
at
the
time
of
the
particular
violation
we're
talking
about
here,
there's
every
incentive,
it
seems
to
me,
that
if
he
can
get
the
defendant
in
a
place
where
he'll
talk,
to
try
and
talk
to
him
as
much
as
he
could.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
no,
but
isn't
it...
you
have
people
who
run
the
police
department.
isn't
the
chief
of
police
going
to
say,
in
these
situations,
always
get
the
statement
because
we
might
be
able
to
prevent
the
man
from
putting
on
a
defense,
because
we've
got
a
rebuttal.
i
mean,
you
know,
you
have
certain
procedures
you
follow
and
i
would
think
the
standard
operating
procedure
would
be,
get
every
statement
you
can,
because
that
will
frustrate
any
false
defenses
the
man
wants
to
offer.
now,
maybe
that's
good
from
a
truth-seeking
point
of
view,
but
i
don't
think
it's
correct
to
say
it
wouldn't
be
in
the
prosecutor's
interest
to
have
such
police
procedures
established.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
what
you're
saying
is
this
which
has
formerly
been
considered
generally
inadmissible
except
for
the
very
narrow
exception
of
impeachment,
now
will
always
be
admissible
if
a
defendant
puts
in
a
case,
and
that's
a
pretty
broad
category
of
situations
and
i
think
it's
broad
enough
so
that
i
would
think
police
departments
around
the
country
would
modify
their
procedures.
justice
stevens
i
certainly
would,
if
i
was
running
the
police
department.
justice
stevens
extending
it...
no.
extending
it
to...
this
is
an
oral
statement
case,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
the
police
have
gotten
an
illegal
oral
statement
and
i
don't
know
why
the
police
officer
shouldn't
do
that
as
standard
operating
practice
if
they
know
they
can
use
it
to
rebut
any
defense
a
defendant
was
going
to
put
on.
justice
stevens
well,
anything
that
tends
to
prove
innocence,
that
would
be
rebutted
by
this...
by
the
statement.
justice
stevens
but
if
he
doesn't
do
the
questioning,
he
wouldn't
have
it
anyway.
you're...
well--
justice
stevens
--well,
i
can't
help
but
interrupt
with
this
one
thought
about
what
the
state
can
live
with.
it's
of
interest
to
me
that
two
of
the
three
dissenting
justices
were
former
state's
attorneys
of
cook
county,
if
i
remember
correctly...
justice
stamos
and
justice
ward.
so,
i
guess
they
thought
the
state
could
live
with
the
rule
they
advocated.
justice
stevens
isn't
the
question
whether
it's
impeachment
within
the
meaning
of
the
exception
or
the
exclusionary
rule
really
a
federal
question
rather
than--
justice
stevens
i
have
two
very
quick
questions,
if
i
may.
did
you
say
that
judge
pincham
tried
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
other
question
i
had
is
how...
is
this
a
typical
period
of
time
from
trial
in
1983
to
now,
on
direct
review?
does
it
take
that
long
in
illinois?
justice
stevens
you
know
it
was
pending
in
the
court
of...
the
appellate
court
for
about
three
years?
justice
stevens
are
things
that...
i'm
just
wondering
if
things
are
that
bad.
this
is
an
awful
long
time
to
get
a
case
here
on
direct
review.
