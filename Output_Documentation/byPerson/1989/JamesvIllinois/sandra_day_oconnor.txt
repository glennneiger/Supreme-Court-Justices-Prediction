justice
o'connor
he
was
arrested
in
his
mother's
beauty
salon
while
he
was
having
his
hair
dyed
and
reshaped?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
conclude
that
that
was
error.
justice
o'connor
and
thought
it
was
harmless?
justice
o'connor
but
if
it
was
error,
it
was
harmless?
justice
o'connor
well,
none
of
our
cases,
though,
have
ever
said
that
there
has
to
be
an
element
of
self-contradiction
in
order
to
have
evidence
that
undermines
credibility
of
a
witness.
that
would
be
a
very
strange
rule
and
while
we've
had
cases
that
have
involved
self-contradiction,
i
don't
think
you
can
find
in
them
any
statement
that
that's
the
only
way
that
credibility
of
a
witness
can
be
undermined,
can
you?
justice
o'connor
so
let's
suppose
that
that's
a
perfectly
legitimate
way
of
undermining
the
credibility
of
a
witness,
to
introduce
rebuttal
evidence
of
this
kind.
justice
o'connor
then
the
question
becomes
whether
it
must
be
accompanied
by
an
instruction
so
that
it's...
it's
limited
in
its
use
to
that
purpose.
as
to
that
question,
i
guess
the
illinois
court,
as
i
understood
it,
thought
it
would
be
harmless.
justice
o'connor
it's
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
view
it
that
way,
counsel.
it
appears
to
me
to
be
some
kind
of
rebuttal
evidence--
justice
o'connor
--introduced
to
undermine
the
credibility
of
the
witness.
justice
o'connor
well,
let's
suppose
we
don't
think
it
is.
