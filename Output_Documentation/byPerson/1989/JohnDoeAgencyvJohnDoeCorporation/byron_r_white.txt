mr.
kneedler,
there's
another
requirement
for
this
exemption,
and
namely
it
has
to
interfere,
be
reasonably
understood
to
interfere
with
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
if
these
documents
had
been
requested
before
any
investigation
had
been
started,
it
would
be
awfully
hard
to
say
it
was
interfering
with
the
investigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
was
the
reasonable...
what
was
the
reasonable
possibility
of
interference
with
an
investigation
here?
the,
the
requesting
party
must
have
had
copies
of
them
already.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
were
the,
they
were
the...
they
were
the
parties
to
the
correspondence,
initially.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
involved
more
documents
than
just
the
initial
correspondence?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
isn't
the...
that
certainly
isn't
the
interpretation
the
court
of
appeals
embraced.
the
court
of
appeals
said
they
either
had
to
be
initially
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes,
when
they
were
first
created.
do
you
defend
that
rationale?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
certainly
eliminates
this
construction
that
you
just
said
was
one
possible
reading
of
the
rule.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
addressed
the...
the
requirement
as
to...
of
the
documents
being
compiled.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
the
decision
the
court
of
appeals
was
reviewing.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
something
is
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here
is
a
section
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
is
headed
up,
application
of
foia
subsection
(b)(7).
and
it
goes
right
ahead
and
concludes
that
the
(b)(7)
is
not
available.
justice
byron
r.
white
hold
it
there.
that
unless
they
were
compiled
at...
eight,
eight
years
ago
for
some
law
enforcement
purposes,
they
couldn't
be
compiled
later
for
that
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
says
that...
that
a
government
entity
cannot
withhold
materials
requested
under
foia
on
the
ground
that
materials
that
were
not
investigatory
records
when
compiled
have
since
acquired
investigative
significance.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
so
say...
you
suggest
that
if
the
records
show
that
the
fbi
requested
these
records
and
said
to
the
agency,
please
find
these
records,
we
think
they
might
be
relevant,
and
the
agency
says
well,
here
they
are,
and
the
fbi
says
they
are
relevant,
send
them
over,
you
would
say
there
is
then
evidence
of,
of
their
being
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
all
of
that
happened
then
the
compilation
requirement
would
be
satisfied?
