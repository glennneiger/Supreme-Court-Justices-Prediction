versus

mr.

chief

william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
know
anything
about
how
the
parties
all
got
this
john
doe
denomination
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
directed--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
everybody
be
designated
as
a
john
doe?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
approach,
though,
don't
we
run
into
something
of
an
ante
litem
motem
problem?
i
mean,
can
the...
the
government
just
undertake
this
compilation
after
it
knows
that
the
documents
are
going
to
be
requested?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
eisenberg.
would
you
enlighten
us,
mr.
eisenberg,
what
you
know
about
the
designation
requirement
of
john
does
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
name
of
your
client?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
think
litigation
in
federal
courts
under
foia
is
a
matter
of,
of
public...
public
notice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
but,
but
you
have
no
objection
to
the
disclosure
of
the
name
of
the
company
now?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
assuming
that
all
happened,
though,
the
way
you
said,
and
i
don't
doubt
it,
mr.
eisenberg,
how,
how
does
that
advance
your
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
is
the
question
presented
in
their
petition
for
certiorari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
court
of
appeals
passed
on
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
did
pass
on
the
exemption
7.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
eisenberg,
in
your
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
your
reasons
for
denying
the
writ...
you
give
three
reasons:
there
is
no
conflict
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
facts
here
are
unique
because
the
records
were
eight
years
old
and
the
decision
faithfully
adheres
to
the
language
of
the
statute's
legislative
history.
now,
our
cases
require
that
if
you
are
going
to
make
a
point
that
we
can't
reach
the
question
presented
by
the,
by
the
petitioner,
you
must
make
it
in
your
brief
in
opposition
or
it
is
deemed
waived.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
really
an
argument...
that,
that
is
your
argument
on
the
merits
really,
why,
why
the
government
shouldn't
prevail
in
its
interpretation
of
rule
7.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
you
are
defending
against
the
question
presented
in
the
petition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
eisenberg,
it
is
your
position
that
if
these
records
were
originally
engendered,
or
to
use
some
word
other
than
compiled,--
[laughter]
--put
together,
by
dcaa
eight
years
ago,
and
clearly,
at
that
time,
they
were
not
for
law
enforcement
purposes,
they
can
never
later
attain
the
status
of
being
compiled
for
law
enforcement's
purposes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could,
could
an
agency
that
is
not
engaged
in
law
enforcement
compile
documents
which
later
would
be
said
to
be
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes
because
the
fbi
or
some
other
law
enforcement
agency
needs
them
to
prosecute
someone?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it,
it
could...
you
don't
rule
it
out...
you
don't
rule
it
out
in
the
abstract?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
eisenberg.
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
