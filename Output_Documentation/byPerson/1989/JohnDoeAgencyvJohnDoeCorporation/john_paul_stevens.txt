mr.
kneedler,
do
you
think
the
district
judge
made
the
findings
that
there
was...
that
you
asked
for,
in
regard
to
subsection
a,
b,
or
c?
is
there
a
finding
that
the
records
could
reasonably
be...
a
disclosure
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
interfere
with
enforcement
proceedings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
does
that
mean
in
practical
terms?
how
could
the
disclosure
of
these
records
interfere
with
the
grand
jury
proceedings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
don't
have
that...
danger
here,
do
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
eisenberg,
i
don't
think
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion.
they
say
the
documents
were
compiled
in
'78
by
this
agency,
seven
years
before
any
law
enforcement
agency
got
involved.
and
then
it
says,
they
were
thus
not
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes
within
the
meaning...
they,
they
say
that
is
enough
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
that's
not.
they
were
thus
not
(b)(7).
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
were
not
compiled
by
anybody
is
what
their
holding
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
but
their
reasoning
is
that
since
they
were
compiled
by
a
non
law
enforcement
agency
for
a
non-law
enforcement
purpose,
and
that'
all
the
record
shows,
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game.
that's
what
they
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
if
you
read
it
that
broadly
really...
your
reading
is
that
records
or
information
in
the
possession
of
a
law
enforcement
agency
if
it
meets
any
other--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand,
but
as
long
as
it
is
in
the
possession
of
an
agency
and
meets
some...
any
of
the
six
other
requirements,
you
would
say
it
had
been
compiled.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
compiled
means
in
possession
of,
i
think
in
your,
your
definition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
your
view,
could
anything
in
the
possession
of
the
agency
for
law
enforcement
purposes
that
meets
these
requirements
not
be
compiled
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
