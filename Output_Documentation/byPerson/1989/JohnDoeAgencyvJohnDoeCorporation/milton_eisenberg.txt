mr.
milton
eisenberg
your
honor,
we,
the
corporation,
requested
that
the
records
be
sealed
after
an
affidavit
was
filed
by
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
which...
a
public
affidavit
in
the
foia
case,
which
disclosed
for
the
first
time,
by
name,
the
subject
of
a
grand
jury
investigation.
and
because
we
didn't
know
what
was
going
to
come
after
that
affidavit...
it
turns
out
that
is
the
only
affidavit
on
the
facts
ever
submitted
in
this
case.
but
because
we
didn't
know
what
was
coming
next,
we
asked
under
rule
6(e),
that
the
records
in
the
case
be
placed
under
seal.
we
did
not
ask
for
this
designation
of
the
caption,
and
have
never
thought
it
made
any
difference
whether
the
defendant
agencies
are
identified
by
their
name
or
by
some
john
doe
reference--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--we
do...
we
do
not,
since
the
government
has
also
just
volunteered
that
the
grand
jury
investigation
is
continuing,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
client's...
the
subject
of
the
investigation's
name
should
be
identified
in
the
caption
or
in--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--your
honor,
i
don't
want
to
make
an
issue
of
this
because,
in
fact,
this
is
a
public
corporation
which
has
disclosed
in
numerous
sec
filings
all
of
the
details
with
respect
to
this
investigation
of
which
it
is
aware.
from
documents
like
the
affidavit
in
this
case,
there
is
no
secret
of
who
the
corporation
is
and...
but
the
reason...
i
just
want
the
court
to
understand
that
the
only
reason
we
had
for
requesting
that
the...
any
portion
of
the
case
be
kept
in
confidence
was
because
the
initial
affidavit
for
the
first
time
disclosed
the
name,
by
name,
that
this
corporation
was
under
grand
jury
investigation
and
under
rule
6,
there's
specific
provision
for
placing
under
seal
matters
affecting
the
grand
jury.
mr.
milton
eisenberg
your
honor,
we...
the,
the
name
of
the
company
has
been
disclosed
in
the
media.
it
has
been
disclosed--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--in
sec
proceedings.
i--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--yes,
i
have
no
objection
to
the
court
amending
the
caption,
if
it
finds
that
more
efficient
or
useful
in
the
court's
discussion
of
the
case
or
decision
in
the
case.
mr.
milton
eisenberg
yes,
your
honor,
but
there
are...
there
are
quite
a
few
of
them
already,
i
believe.
we
have
wandered
somewhat
from
the
record
in
this
case
in
the
course
of
the
government's
presentation
of
the
facts.
i
would
like
to
emphasize,
as
i
just
have,
that
there
is
only
one
affidavit
on
the
facts
in
the
record
in
this
case.
and
it
appears
on
page
60
and
61
of
the
joint
appendix.
it's
an
affidavit
submitted
by
an
assistant
united
states
attorney,
named
sean
o'shea,
who
was
the
grand
jury
attorney.
and
it
states
all
the
facts
that
were
in
this
record
when
the
district
court
made
its
decision
and
when
the
court
of
appeals
made
its
decision,
with
one
qualification.
there
were
a
number
of
exhibits
attached
to
the
government's
answer
to
the
complaint,
which
are
also
in
the
record.
and
all
that
he
says
about
the
facts
is
that
the
documents
in
this
case
were
removed
from
the
dcaa
by
the
fbi
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
them
to
a
grand
jury,
that
the
documents
were
compiled
by
the
dcaa.
there
is
no
statement
in
this
affidavit
or
in
any
subsequent
affidavit
that
they
were
ever
compiled
by
the
fbi
or
recompiled
by
the
fbi,
or
that
they
were
compiled
by
the
dcaa
for
any
law
enforcement
purpose.
it
is
clear
from
the
affidavit
that
they
were
compiled
in
the
normal
routine
of
the
agency's
performance
of
its
oversight
functions,
in
this
case,
reviewing
contractor
charging
practices
under
government
defense
contracts.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
this
affidavit
or
in
any
other
affidavit
that
the
dcaa
was
cooperating
in
a
law
enforcement
investigation
with
the
fbi
at
any
time.
what
the
record
establishes,
and
this
now
is
mainly
through
the
exhibits
and
some
affidavits
that
were
submitted
after
the
court
decisions
in
connection
with
stay
motions
and
the
like,
is
that
these
documents
were
generated
in
1978
by
the
dcaa
in
connection
with
one
of
these
routine
government
contract
audits,
that
they
were
in
the
dcaa's
files
for
eight
years
after
that,
in
fact
in
dead
storage.
the
first
response
to
the
request
to
the
dcaa
for
the
documents
is
give
us
more
time
to
locate
them;
they
are
very
old.
obviously,
they
were
not
being
used
for
any
law
enforcement
purpose
at
that
time.
they
were
used
for
archival
purposes.
they
were
sitting
in
the
dead
files
of
the
dcaa.
there
is
no
suggestion
any
place
in
this
record
that
at
any
time
after
they
were
retrieved
from
dead
storage
and
withheld
from
the
requestor,
the
corporation,
that
they
assumed
a
law
enforcement
purposes
in
the
dcaa's
possession.
what
the
dcaa
said
when
they
denied
production
of
the
documents
was
the
fbi,
in
fact
an
assistant
united
states
attorney,
whom
they
designate
by
name,
mr.
milton,
has
directed
us
to
withhold
these
documents.
therefore,
we
can't
give
them
to
you.
and
in
a
later...
and,
and
there
is
in
the
record
the
letter
from
the
dcaa
to
the
same
assistant
u.s.
attorney,
in
which
they
say
to
the
u.s.
attorney,
since
you
have
now
directed
us
to
withhold
these
documents
and
you
have
possession
of
them,
will
you
handle
this
appeal
that
the
corporation
is
filing.
no
indication
of
any
cooperation,
joint
effort,
consultation.
this
was
the
fbi
saying
to
the
dcaa,
don't
comply
with
this
foia
request.
we
don't
want
you
to
give
any
of
these
documents
to
this
corporation,
and
then
seizing
them
from
the
dcaa
and
saying,
in
the
affidavit
they
filed,
we
are
going
to
present
them
to
a
grand
jury;
therefore
for
that
reason,
because
these
are
going
to
be
grand
jury
materials,
you
should
not
disclose
them
to
this
corporation.
that
is--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--i,
i
think
it,
it,
it
should
be
decisive,
your
honor,
because
the
critical
time
in
any
case
for
determining
whether
documents
have
been
compiled
for
a
law
enforcement
purpose
has
to
be
the
time
the
documents
are
requested
or,
at
least,
the
time
when
the
request
is
denied
by
the
agency.
mr.
milton
eisenberg
well,
then,
it's...
it's
the
very
differences,
your
honor,
between
exemption
1
and
exemption
7,
that
i
think
make
it
clear
why
that
should
not
be
the
case
under
exemption
7.
under
exemption
1,
which
applies
to
documents
relating
to
national
security,
the
exemption
incorporates
by
reference
an
executive
order.
the
classification
of
documents
depends
on
what
the
executive
order
permits
and
provides
for.
those
documents
contain
state
secrets.
it
makes
no
difference
to
their
status
when
or
for
what
purpose
they
were
generated,
or
where
they
are
located.
mr.
milton
eisenberg
yes,
your
honor,
but
the--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--that
is
all,
al
true,
your
honor,
under
exemption
1,
but
the
reason
for
it
is
that
the
executive
order
incorporated
specifically
into
the
statutory
exemption
provides
that
documents
may
be
classified
or
reclassified
after
a
request
is
made
under
foia.
mr.
milton
eisenberg
i...
i'm
not
sure
that
the
ten-day
period
is
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
documents
should,
at
some
point
after
the
request,
be
compiled,
but--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--yes,
yes.
your
honor,
that
such
interpretation
could
be
placed
on
it.
but
nothing
happened
here
within
that
ten-day
period
to
suggest
that--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--your
honor,
i
not
only
defend
it,
i
defend
it
happily
and
heartily,
but
that
is--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--your
honor,
we
have
to
put
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
its
proper
context,
and
that
depends
on
the
posture
of
the
case
when
it
was
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
government
did
not
present
any
exemption
7
argument
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
government's
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
that
exemption
3
protected
these
documents
from
disclosure,
because
rule
6(e)
is
a
statute
for
exemption
e
purposes.
and
because
these
are
now
grand
jury
documents,
exemption
3
is
the
exemption
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
focus
on
in
determining
whether
they
should
be
withheld.
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
mr.
milton
eisenberg
your
honor,
it
addressed
it
because
the
district
court,
without
making
any
determination
that
these
documents
had
ever
been
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes,
relied
on
exemption
7
for
his
conclusion
that
their
disclosure
would
interfere
with
the
grand
jury
proceedings.
mr.
milton
eisenberg
it,
it
reviewed
that
decision,
your
honor,
but
i
think
in
fairness--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--well,
let
me,
let
me...
i
want
to
make
a
full
response
to
the
court's
question,
because
that
is
a
decision
the
court
must
decide,
this
court
must
decide,
whether
to
affirm
or
reverse.
the
government,
relying
on
exemption
3
in
the
court
of
appeals,
could
make
all
of
the
same
arguments
for
not
disclosing
these
documents
because
they
were
grand
jury
materials,
without
having
to
meet
any
threshold
requirement.
and
since
they
had
made
no
record
in
the
trial
court
and
there
was
no
record
in
the
court
of
appeals
suggesting
remotely
any
of
the
things
that
have
been
suggested
in
the
supreme
court
as
the
factual
basis
for
such
a
determination,
the,
the
government
had
a
way
of
defending
the
withholding
of
the
documents
that
avoided
entirely
the
issue
that
justice
white
has
directed
attention
to:
whether
they
were
compiled
for
law
enforcement.
having
made
that
tactical
decision
and
lost
on
the
exemption
7
justification
advance
in
the...
i'm
sorry,
lost
on
the
exemption
3
justification
advanced
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
don't
think
that
adds
any
weight
to
the
argument...
to
the
attempt
now
to
relitigate
the
same
factual
issue,
whether,
because
these
documents
were
presented
to
a
grand
jury,
we
should
now
focus
on
exemption
7.
they
didn't
rely
on
exemption
7
in
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--yes,
your
honor,
and
we--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--no,
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
pass
on
it.
mr.
milton
eisenberg
oh,
it
considers
exemption
7,
your
honor,
in
this
context:
it
says
that
the
trial
court
relied
on
exemption
7.
the
trial
court
did
not
make
any
determination,
any
finding,
with
regard
to
whether
the
records
were
compiled.
that
finding
is
essential
for
exemption
7
to
have
any
application.
obviously,
in
this
case,
they
weren't
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
they
were
eight
years
old.
they
were
compiled
prior
to
and
independently
of
any
law
enforcement
investigation.
they
were
in
the
dead
files
of
the
dcaa
when
they
were
requested.
they
were
not
taken
by
the
fbi
or
for
presentation
for
any
purpose
until
after
that
request--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--we,
we're
not
suggesting
that
you
can't
reach
the
point,
your
honor.
we
are
suggesting
only
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
make
the
broad
ruling
that
justice
white--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
am
giving
you
the
reason
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave.
the
reason
the
court
of
appeals
gave
is
that
the
only
evidence
in
this
record
is
that
these
documents
were
compiled
by
the
dcaa.
that
no
record
exists
for
any
finding
that
they
were
subsequently
or
at
any
other
time
compiled
or
recompiled--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--no,
your
honor,
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
on
that
subject
is
that
merely
taking
records
that
are
not
exempt
under
any
of
the
statutory
exemptions
in
the
freedom
of
information
act
and
co-mingling
them
with
a
investigative
file
was
not
a
basis
for
saying
that
those
non-exempt
records
had
acquired
the
exemption
that
applied
to
other
records
in
that
exempt
file.
in
so
stating,
all
the,
all
the
court
of
appeals
was
doing,
in
judge
winter's
opinion
was
paraphrasing
this
court's
decisions
in
abramson
and...
and
robbins.
it
was
not
making
new
law.
mr.
milton
eisenberg
yes,
your
honor,
and
it
goes
on
to
quote
the
robbins
and
abramson
language
construing
the
same
compiled-for-law-enforcement-purposes
language.
mr.
milton
eisenberg
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
our
argument
on
the--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--that,
that's
right.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
the
court
can't
reach
the
question.
we
are
suggesting
that
on
the
record
in
this
case
there
is
only
one
answer
to
that
question.
and
the
answer
is
that
on
the
record
in
this
case,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
that
these
documents
were
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes
by
the
dcaa
or
thereafter
by
any
other
agency.
the--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--if,
if
that
happened,
if
the
fbi
initiated
the
request
because
it
had
some
reason
to
believe
that,
i
would
not
say
that
merely
removing
otherwise
non-exempt
files
would--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--no,
your
honor.
that
would
not
be
a
compilation.
that
would
be
taking
files
from
one
place
and
relocating
them
to
another
place.
let
me...
let
me
give
you--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--well,
the,
the
government
cited
us
to
webster's
new
collegiate
dictionary
for
what
it
claimed
were
the
ordinary
meanings
of
the
term
to
compile.
none
of
the
definitions
they
cited
included
to
seize,
to
transfer,
to
take
custody
of,
to
remove
or
to
co-mingle.
and
none
of
the
definitions--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--not
in
webster's.
they
did
find
in
the
third...
in
the
reply
brief,
which
we
have
not
been
able
to
respond
to,
they
did
find
the
third
definition
in
random
house,
the
definition
of
compile
as
meaning
gathering,
for
which
the
example
given
is
the
example
justice
scalia
suggests.
compiling
data,
that
is
the
example
given.
random
house
says
that
the
definitions
in
its
dictionary
are
listed
in
a
prescribed
order.
the
ordinary
usage
of
the
term
is
listed
first,
in
speech
or
in
any
other
usage.
and
the
more
rare,
archaic,
technical
usages
are
listed
thereafter.
this
is
the
third
or
fourth
usages.
and
it...
and
it,
it's
compiling
data
that
is
the
example.
it
is
not
simply
relocating
documents
from
one
place
to
another
place.
they
could...
the,
the
congress
could
have
said
gathered
up,
it
could
have
said
used
for
law
enforcement
purpose,
it
could
have
said
obtained
for
law
enforcement...
there
are
so...
obtained
for
law
enforcement
purpose.
there
are
so
many
words
it
could
have
used.
but
it
chose
one
that
has
a
very
precise
meaning,
i
have
discovered
since
this
case
was
briefed,
in
all
of
the
dictionaries
we
have
consulted.
and
it
is
not
the
equivalent
of
what
the
fbi
did
in
this
case,
whether
they
did
it
on
their
own
initiative,
in
consultation
with,
or
because
they
wanted
to
thwart
the
corporation's
access
to
these
records.
mr.
milton
eisenberg
no,
your
honor,
that...
that's...
there
is
some
law
to
that
effect,
but
that
position
is
not
the
position
we
have
taken
in
our
brief.
because
within
the...
there
are
cases
like
crowell
&
moring,
for
example,
in
which
the
audit
report
itself
is
the
impetus
for
the
law
enforcement
investigation.
and
it
is
still
within
the
agency's
possession
and
control.
obviously,
that
is
a
totally
different
situation
than
that
in
which
the
documents
are
not
being
used
at
any
time
by
the
agency
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
so
i
am
not
saying
that
there
has
to
be
an
fbi
removal
in
order
for
all
agency
documents
to
meet
the
threshold
requirement.
mr.
milton
eisenberg
well,
i...
it...
it's
very
hard
to
deal
with
that
in
the
abstract,
without
specific
facts
and
documents--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--but
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rule
it
out
in
the
abstract;
we
do
not
rule
it
out
in
the
abstract.
but
in
this
case,
there
is
no
evidence
that
that
ever
happened.
and
based
on--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--i...
i
it's
entirely...
consistent.
let
me--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
justice
kennedy,
in
finding
that
these
documents
were
compiled
by
the
dcaa
for
non-law
enforcement
purposes.
it
does
not
say
that,
because
of
that,
they
either
could
subsequently
or
could
not
subsequently
be
recompiled
by
any
other
agency,
including
the
dcaa,
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
what
they
say
is
that
there
is
no
evidence,
there
is
no
record
in
this
case,
there
is
no
argument
in
this
case,
there
is
no
issue
in
this
case
as
to
whether
that
happened,
because
the
government
never
asserted
that.
mr.
milton
eisenberg
by
that
agency,
the
dcaa.
that
is
the
finding
that
they
are
making.
mr.
milton
eisenberg
your
honor,
if
it
has--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--and
that
is
why
i
think
context
and
posture
is
so
important.
there
was
no
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
government--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--that
they'd
been,
so
the
court--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--on
this
record,
in
light
of
these
arguments
and
the
government's
position
in
the
court
of
appeals,
yes.
not
for
all
purposes,
under
all
circumstances,
in
other
cases
where
a
different
record
is
made.
mr.
milton
eisenberg
i,
i,
i...
i'm
honored--
mr.
milton
eisenberg
--your
honor,
i
am
honored
to
be
here
at
the
first
argument
of
the
first
day
of
the
court's
new
term,
but
i
have
no
idea
why
this
case
should
lead
off
the
court's
new
term.
[laughter]
it
has
no
significance
on
the
record
in
this
case
as
the
construction
of
these
key
words.
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
the
government
demeans
professor
howe's
compilation
of
the
holmes-laski
letters
in
his
famous
work
by
comparing
it
to
what
the
fbi
did
in
this
case
when
it
removed
custody
of
these
documents
from
the
dcaa.
but
let
us,
let
us
assume
for
a
moment
that
instead
of
publishing
this
historic
work,
what
professor
howe
did
was
this:
he
learned
that
someone
else
was
on
the
trail
of
justice
holmes'
letters.
so
first,
he
directed
justice
holmes
not
to
disclose
them
to
someone
else
or
anybody
else.
and
then
he
appeared
in
justice
holmes'
chambers
and
removed
the
letters
from
justice
holmes
so
that
no
member
of
the
public
could
thereafter
have
access
to
them.
we
might
call
such
high-handed
conduct
by
many
names,
but
i
don't
think
any
of
them
would
be
compilation.
without
sugarcoating
it,
that
is
just
what
the
fbi
did
in
this
case.
by
doing
that,
they
thwarted
the
administrative
process
in
this...
in
all
foia
cases,
and
they
did
it
without
any
of
the
justifications
in
an
executive
order,
such
as
apply
to
exemption
1
cases,
which
specifically
authorize
that
kind
of
process.
after
an
foia
request
is
filed,
by
the
explicit
terms
of
the
executive
order,
a
document
may
be
classified
or
reclassified.
that
is
not
the
case
with
respect
to
any
of
the
other
exemptions,
and
the
fact
that
they
had
to
say
in
an
executive
order
documents
can
be
classified
or
reclassified.
this...
there
is
nothing
about
compiling
or
recompiling
in
exemption
7
means
that...
if
they
had
just
said
classified,
they
would
not
have
assumed
that
classify
meant
classified
or
reclassified.
you
wouldn't
have
to
use
both
words
if
the
government's
interpretation
of
exemption
7
have
merit.
if
i
may
borrow
a
phrase
from
the
government's
reply
brief,
it
would
trivialize
exemption
7's
threshold
test,
to
equate
the
conduct
in
this
case
with
the
compilation
of
information
or
records
for
law
enforcement
purpose.
despite
the
focus
on
semantics
and
grammar
in
briefs,
the
argument
between
the
corporation
and
the
government
is
not
just
over
words.
what
the
government
really
is
concerned
about
is
the
ability
of
the
subject...
of
a
subject
of
an
investigation
to
obtain
any
information,
any
evidence
that
might
be
useful
to
the
subject
of
the
investigation
which
he
could
not
obtain
prior
to
or
unless
he
is
indicted
under
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
it's
because
of
those
provisions
in
exemption
7
that
the
president
vetoed
the
1974
bill,
that
the
attorney
general
testified,
strenuously
opposed
it,
and
the
fbi
was
apoplectic.
prosecutors
much
prefer
a
system
under
which
they
can
carry
on
their
investigations
with
two,
three
or,
in
this
case,
over
four
years,
this
investigation,
we
are
told,
has
been
in
progress,
while
the
subjects
are
on
standby,
and
then
make
whatever
disclosures
the
federal
rules
permit
in
the
70
days
between
arraignment
and
trial,
and
as
close
to
trial
as
they
can
make
it
in
any
particular
case.
as
north
v.
walsh,
which
we
discussed
in
our
supplemental
brief,
points
out,
the
department
of
justice
has,
in
fact,
again
proposed
an
amendment
which
would
prohibit
use
of
the
foia
as
a
discovery
device.
but
congress
has
not
adopted
that
amendment.
and
what
it
adopted,
over
the
strenuous
objections
of
the
department
of
justice
in
1974,
which
is
language
which
contains
no
such
limitation.
having
failed
before
congress,
the
government
would
like
an
interpretation
of
exemption
7's
threshold
requirement
from
this
court
that
would
nullify
its
significance.
but
to
prevail
in
this
case
the
government
must
stretch
the
facts
beyond
recognition,
write
its
own
dictionaries
and
rules
of
grammar,
and
convince
the
court
to
rewrite
the
language
of
the
statute
and
its
legislative
history,
since,
in
our
view,
there
is
also
no
record
in
this
case.
