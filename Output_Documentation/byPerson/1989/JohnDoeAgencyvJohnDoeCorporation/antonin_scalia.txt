justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
it
is
a
very
strange
result,
isn't
it,
that
had
the
agency
complied
with
the
request
before
consulting
with
the
fbi,
or
had
it
decided
not
to
consult,
the
document
would
have
been
openly
available
to
the
public.
right?
or,
had
the
request
be...
been
made
before
the
fbi
decided
to
compile
the
documents,
that...
anybody
could
have
gotten
the
documents?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
documents
hadn't
been
compiled
for
that
criminal
investigation,
according
to
your
theory.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
at
any
time
before
that,
the
very
same
document
could
have
gotten
out,
so
that
this,
this
person
was
just
a
couple
of
days
too
late,
perhaps?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
agency
consulted
the
fbi.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
it
had
been
asked
for
the
day
before
the
investigation
was
complete...
was,
was
begun,
then
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
same
document
could
have
been
obtained?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
the
document
just
changes
its
character
from,
from
having,
you
know,
been
compiled.
and
you
say
compiled
means
gathered
and
assembled?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
the
only
thing
it
can
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i
say
he
compiled
a
wonderful
pitching
record,
you
know,
a
particular
athlete
compiled
a
wonderful
pitching
record.
do
you
think
that
would
describe
his...
i
don't
know,
getting...
cutting
out
of
newspapers--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
a
lot
of
pitching
records
of
other
pitchers
and,
and
gathering
them
all
together?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
means
he
produced
it,
right,
didn't
he?
he
accomplished
it
himself.
can't
it
bear
that
meaning?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
this
exchange.
are
you
asserting
that
in
addition
to
meeting...
to
meeting
d,
you
have
to
meet
a?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
have
to
show
that
these
documents
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
interfere
with
enforcement
proceedings.
you
wouldn't
have
to
show
that,
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
the
one
you
are
arguing
applied:
d.
that
is
what
we're
arguing
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
you
are
not
arguing...
well,
for
that
you
don't
have
to
show
it
was
compiled,
do
you?
you
don't
have
to
show
that
it
was
compiled
by
a
criminal
law
enforcement
authority.
a
doesn't
require
compilation
by
a
criminal
law
enforcement
authority.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
what
are
we
arguing
about
this
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
show
the
direction
or
strategy
of
the...
of
the
investigation
unless
you
were
foolish
enough
to
tell
the
person
when
the
person
got
them
that
these
had
been
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
if
you
didn't
tell
them
that
they
were
part
of
the
investigation
file
the
person
wouldn't
have
any
more
reason
to
believe
that
this
was
part
of
the
investigation
than
any
other
document
received
under
foia.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe,
but
it
wouldn't,
wouldn't
indicate
the
direction
of
the
investigation.
you
don't
know
whether
the
investigators--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
so,
but
so,
so
would
any
foia...
any
foia
request.
so
every
document
that
you
turn
over
fits,
fits
the
definition
of
a,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
i
am
still
interested
in
the
word
compiled
now.
the
prologue
to
7
speaks
of
records
compiled,
but
later
on
7(d)
uses
the
same
terminology,
it
says
in
the
case
of
a
record
compiled.
now,
under
the
freedom
of
information
act,
a
record
can
mean
a
single
document,
can't
it,
a
single...
unlike
files,
it
means
a
single
piece
of
paper
is
a
record.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it
could
mean
a
single
piece
of
paper,
too,
couldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
how
do
you
compile
a
single
piece
of
paper,
except
in
the
sense
that
i
used
the
word
compile?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
mean
produced.
why
wouldn't
that
be
in
accord?
if,
if
you
interpret
compile
the
way
you
just
have,
would
you...
would
you
say
that
a
document
that
is
exempt
under
7(d)
would
lose
its
status
after
the
investigation
is
terminated
and
the
compilation
is
broken
up?
justice
antonin
scalia
i,
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
don't
know
how
you
could
extend
the
extension
beyond
the
break-up
of
the
criminal
investigation
if
the
only
thing
that
causes
it
to
be
a
record
compiled
is
the
gathering
together
of
it
for
a
criminal
investigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
you
are
shooting
yourself
in
the
foot.
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
we
have
a
lot
of
cases
called
john
doe
v.
john
doe
it
will
be
hard
to
refer
to
them,
you
know.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that
so?
it
is
certainly
not
the
case
for
classified
documents,
for
example.
it
is
well
established
that
you
can
classify
a
document
after
the
request
is
made
and
then
decline
the
request
on
the
basis
that
it
is
classified.
why
should
this
be
any
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
just
because
something
is
classifiable
under
the
executive
order
does
not
mean
that
it
is
classified.
many
things
that
are
classifiable
are
not
classified.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
right?
and
you
acknowledge
that
you
can
classify
them
after
the
foia
request
and
then
deny
the
request,
saying
this
is
a
classified
document.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
good
deal
less
significant
than
we
thought
it
was,
i
suppose,
when
we
granted
cert--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we
are
just
reviewing
whether
they
were,
indeed,
gathered,
right?
you
are
willing
to
say
you
can
gather
them;
they
just
weren't
gathered
here.
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
under
your
theory,
an
agency
could
issue,
the
fbi
could
issue
a
notice
to
all
agencies
in
the
government
saying
x
corporation
is
under
investigation,
we
are
interested
in
what
kind
of...
what
kind
of...
foia
documents
this
corporation
is
trying
to
get
in,
in
anticipating
defense
of
this
suit.
therefore,
whenever
you
get
a
foia
request
from
this
corporation
let
us
know
and
we
want
to,
we
want
to
see
the
document,
because
it
is
relevant
to
our
investigation.
