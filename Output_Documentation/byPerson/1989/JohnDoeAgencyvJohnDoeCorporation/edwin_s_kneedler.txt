mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
interpretation
of
the
law
enforcement
exemption
to
the
freedom
of
information
act.
that
exemption,
exemption
7,
provides
that
the
act
"does
not
apply
to
matters
that
are
records
or
information
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
"
if
the
production
of
the
records
or
information
would
produce
any
one
of
six
enumerated
harms.
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
the
importance
of
the
public
and
private
interests
that
are
protected
by
exemption
7,
in
robbins
tire,
in
abramson
and
in
reporters
committee.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
was
the
proceeding...
the
court
of
appeals
granted
a
motion
for
the
proceedings
on
appeal
to
proceed
under
seal,
and
as
a
result
of
that,
the...
the...
we
have...
we
have
continued
to
comply
with
the,
with
the
requirement
that
the
agencies
be
referred
to
as
john
doe
agency
and
john
doe
government
agency.
we
have...
we
have
no
objection
to
disclosing
the
names
of
the
agencies.
we
have
just
continued
under
that
practice
because
that
was
the
order
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
or...
or...
under
seal...
under
seal,
so
that...
at
least
with
the
names
under
seal,
so
that
the
public
would
not
know.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
as
i
have
said,
the
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
the
importance
of
these
law
enforcement
interests,
and
after
abramson
was
decided,
congress
in
fact
built
upon
abramson
and
expanded
the
coverage
of
exemption
7,
to
ensure
that
law
enforcement
information
would
be
protected
irrespective
of
the
format
in
which
it
was
collected.
foremost
among
the
purposes
of
exemption
7,
as
this
court
and
congress
have
repeatedly
stated,
was
to
protect
the
government's
case
from
interference.
the
circumstances
of
this
case
well
illustrate
the
importance
of
exemption
7
in
this
regard.
the
freedom
of
information
act
request
was
submitted
in
the
context
of
an
ongoing
grand
jury
proceeding.
it
was
submitted
by
a
target
of
that
investigation,
and
the
district
court
specifically
found
that
the...
this...
that
production
of
the
documents
would
jeopardize
the
proceedings.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
documents
were
compiled
after
the
request
was
made,
but
in
our
view
they
were...
they
were
compiled...
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes;
they
were
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes
before
the
request
was
denied.
the
sequence
of
events
was
that
the
freedom
of
information
act...
the...
the
grand
jury...
or
the
criminal
investigation
began
in
1985.
there
was
a
subpoena
in
1986,
in
february,
to
the
corporation.
as
a
result
of
that,
the
corporation
alerted
to
the
investigation
and
filed
a
foia
request
in
september
of
1986
with
the
john
doe
agency,
the
auditing
agency
involved
in
the
case.
that
agency
consulted
with
the
law
enforcement
agency
involved
in
the
case,
and
on
the
advice
of
that
law
enforcement
agency,
denied
the
request
on
november
18.
and
then
on
november
20th,
the
documents
deemed
responsive
to
the
foia
request
were
transferred
from
the
first
agency
to
the
second
agency.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i...
i
think...
i
think
most...
in
the
sense
that
the
statute
uses
the
term
compilation,
i
think
that
once
the,
the
department
of
justice,
in
this...
in
the
course
of
this
consultation
said
yes,
indeed,
these
documents
are
relevant
to
our
investigation,
we
want
them,
and
don't
disclose
them,
we
think
at
that
point
the
records
were,
were
gathered
together
or
incorporated--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
are
several
senses
in
which
they
could
be.
i...
i
think...
i
think
the
initial
sense--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
the
court
doesn't
have
to
adopt
that...
the
court
doesn't
have
to
go
that
far
in
this
case
because
the
records
were
subsequently
transphysically
transferred
to
the
second
agency,
and
they
are
included
in
a
larger
collection
of
documents
that
the
second
agency
has.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
or,
or
gather
them,
take,
take
them
together.
that,
that
would
be
one
possible
construction,
i
suppose,
of,
of
the
act.
and
here
that
was
done,
because
the
second
agency
gathered
the
documents,
put
them...
put
them
in
its
files,
which
concededly,
its
files
concededly--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i,
i
don't
think
that...
i
don't
think
that
construction
would
be...
would
fit
with
the
sense
of
the
statute.
this
isn't
a
situation
in
which
there...
in
which
there
should
be
a
race
to
the
documents
in
the
sense
of
who
has
a
prior
lien
on
them,
or
something
like
that.
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--excuse
me,
when?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
when.
well,
in
our...
it
is
our
view
that
they
were
compiled
at
the
time
that
the
second
agency,
through
the...
speaking
through
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
said
yes,
those
documents
are
included
in
the
subject
matter
of
our
investigation.
after
the
first
agency
consulted
with
the
second
agency.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
uh,
yes.
uh--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
uh
yes,
that
is...
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
dca...
dcaa
retrieved
the
documents
from
its
files
and
at
that...
consulted
with
the
fbi,
and
the
fbi
said
yes,
those
documents
are
relevant
to
the...
to
the
investigation.
at
that
point,
the
documents
took
on
the
status
of
being
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
in
our
view,
the
statute
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
we
think
that
they
were
compiled
even
before
that.
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
that,
that
question
in
this
case
because
in
any
event
by
the
time
the
district
court
was
asked
to
act
in
this
case
the
documents
had
been
transferred.
at
that
point,
at
the
very
least,
they
were...
they
had
the
status
of
being
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes
in
the
files
of
the
second
agency,
and
they
were
no...
they
wouldn't
have
been
improperly
withheld
at
that
point
because
the
information
they
contained
was
compiled
by...
by
the
second
agency.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
as...
as
long
as,
as
long
as
the
documents
become
protected
at
any
period
of
time,
the...
the
exemption
applies.
and
that...
and...
and
by
the
same
token,
if
the
exemption
doesn't
apply
after
a
certain
period
of
time.
for
example
under
exemption
7,
if
a
grand
jury
investigation
terminates,
then
under
exemption
7(a)
that
exemption
would
no
longer
apply,
because
the
documents
are...
would
no
longer
be
serving
the
purpose
for...
for
which
they
were
gathered
in
a
pending
proceeding.
so,
what...
what
we
are
saying
is
that...
is
that...
an
investigation
is
a
dynamic
thing.
and
on...
at
this
case
the
investigation
came
in,
or
the
foia
request
came
in
right
in
the
middle,
or
actually
fairly
early
in
the
investigation.
and
it's...
it's
not
necessarily
true
that
the
investigating
agency
would
have
all
of
the
information
yet
in
hand.
and
in
fact
in
this
case,
the
foia
request
may
well
have
alerted
the
agency
to
particular
documents
in
its
possession
that
were
relevant
to
the
investigation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
they...
because,
to,
to
bring
them
promptly
within
the
control
of
the
fbi
because
they
were
relevant
to
the
ongoing
investigation.
the...
both
the...
the...
the
agency
that
had
them
and
the
fbi
acted
responsibly.
the...
the
two
agencies
work,
work
as
a
team
in
an
investigation
like
this.
the
fbi
doesn't
have
the
expertise,
uh,
uh,
with
the
details
of
every
program
in
which
fraud
or
corruption
might
arise,
and
so
the
fbi
has
to
rely
on
the
expertise
of
the
other
agencies,
in,
in
this
case
the
auditing
agency.
the
auditing
agency
said
we
want
to
tell
you
we
have
relevant
information;
and
the
fbi
says
you're
right,
it
does,
please...
please
give
it
to
us
and
we'll
send
somebody
over
for
it.
and
it
was
done
contemporaneously
with
the
denial
of
the
foia
request.
and...
i,
i
should
point
out
that
after
the
corporation
appealed
the
denial
by
the,
the
dcaa
through
its
procedures,
that
agency
stated
that
the
request
was
being
denied
because
the
records
were
under
the
control
and
possession
of
the
fbi.
and
that
acknowledging--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well...
but
there's
no
suggestion
that
this
was
done
to,
to
avoid
complying
with
the
foia
request.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
uh,
i
am
not
aware
of
any...
i
mean,
that,
that
argument...
that
argument
could
be
made,
but
not
for,
not
for...
not
for
any
devious
purpose
at
all.
the
records
became...
came,
came
to
the
attention
of
the
investigators,
they
concluded
they
were
relevant
and
properly
included
them
within
the...
within
the
investigative
file.
now,
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
the...
i'm
informed
that
the
investigation
is,
is
still
pending,
although
all
of
the
documents
at
issue
here
were
submitted
to
the...
to
the
grand
jury
after...
after
they
were
received
by,
by
the
agency.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
uh,
yes--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
no.
in
this
case...
in
this
case,
that
makes
it
especially
vivid
that
the
exemption
is,
is
invoked.
but
under,
under
established
case
law,
once
an
audit
or,
or
an...
or
a
monitoring
becomes
focused
on
possible
wrongdoing
in
a,
in
a
specific
context,
that
becomes
an
investigation.
and
that
may
well
occur
by,
by
an
auditing
agency.
therefore,
i...
i
would
just
like
to
urge
the
court
not,
not
to
suggest,
because
it
wasn't
challenged
in
this
case,
that
the
audit
was
not...
did
not
have
law
enforcement
purposes.
that
is
not
to
suggest
that
every
audit
conducted
by
this
agency
doesn't
have
law
enforcement--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it,
it
was
not,
because
i
think
if
the...
again
that
makes
it
vivid,
but
if...
but,
but
even,
even
if,
even
if
the
dcaa
had
never...
had
never
consulted
with
the
fbi,
that...
after
it
retrieved
the
documents,
looked
at
them
and
said
we
know
these
are
relevant
to
this
ongoing
investigation,
and
denied
it
on
that
ground
and
then
transferred
them
to
the
fbi,
the
same
result
would
obtain
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
was
consultation
between
the
two.
the
record
doesn't
disclose
who,
who...
who
originated
the
idea
or
the
decision
to
withhold
them.
but
the
denial
letter
says
that
on
the
direction
and
advise
of
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
the
records
were
denied.
but
that
is
consistent
with
the
relationship
of
the
two
agencies
in
a
law
enforcement
situation.
under
title
28
the
attorney
general
is
given
control
over
criminal
investigations.
section
533
directs
the
attorney
general
to
appoint
officials
to...
investigate
and
prosecute
crimes
against
the
united
states;
the
u.s.
attorneys
have
that
responsibility.
and
under
section
516,
the
department
of
justice
is
given
responsibility
to
litigate
cases
involving
the
united
states...
including
securing
evidence.
so
those
statutory
provisions
at
least
mean
that
when
there
is
a
criminal
investigation
going
on,
that
it
is
entirely
proper
that
the
justice
department
be
consulted
and
that
the
justice
department
have
at
least
a
primary
say
in
whether
the
documents
should
be
withheld.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
maybe...
maybe
i
misspoke,
but
at
the
time...
at,
at
the
time
the
request
came
in,
there
was
already
a
criminal
investigation
going
on.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
at
the
time
the
request
came
in,
but
at
the
time
it
was
retrieved,
and,
and
its
relevance
to
the
investigation
was,
was
identified,
at
that
point
the
agency
categorized
it
and
included
it
within
the...
within
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i...
i
think
what...
presumably,
whenever
it
was
requested,
at
least
after
the
criminal
investigation
was
initiated,
whenever
it
was
requested
and
had
been
retrieved
by
the
agency,
the
same
result
would
have
followed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
no,
as
i,
as
i...
as
i
say,
that
happened
in
this
case
and
that
makes...
that
makes
it
clear,
but
if
the
agency
on
its
own
said
this
is
relevant
to
an
ongoing
investigation,
law
enforcement
investigation,
of
this
corporation,
and
says...
and
this
had
to
do
with
cost
overcharges
in
a
particular
year,
and
they
retrieved
the
records
and
looked
at
them
and
say--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
at,
at
least
if
an
investigation
was
not
begun
before
there
was
a
response.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
means
gathered,
gathered
together,
assembled--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
can
mean...
well,
it...
i
suppose
it
could
mean
shuffling
documents
together
in
a
file.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
no,
no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
no,
what
i...
and
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
could
bear
that
meaning,
but,
but
looking
at
it
in
the
context
of,
of
what
foia
is,
is
aimed
at,
which
is...
which
is,
i
think,
the,
the
important
thing,
these,
these
were
records
that
were
categorized
by
both
the
fbi
and
dcaa
as
being
relevant
to
the
law
enforcement
investigation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
and
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
so,
so
under,
under...
under
either
that
specific
requirement
of
7(a)
or
the
threshold--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
we
don't
know
what
it
had...
we
don't
know
what
it
had
copies
of.
a
lot
of...
a
lot
of
the
documents--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
true,
but,
but
in
the...
a
lot
of
the
documents,
a
very
substantial
amount
of
the
documents
in
a
case
such
as
this
by
an
auditing
agency
like
dcaa,
are...
all,
all
of
the
audit
work
papers
that
the
agency
itself
generates.
it
could
involve,
in,
in,
in
a
typical
case
it
could
involve
interviews
with
witnesses,
it
could
involve--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--oh,
absolutely.
and
the
initial
correspondence
is
in
the
record.
the...
the
respondent
has
the
initial
correspondence.
he
is
just
trying
to
look
behind
at
the
information
that
he
doesn't
have.
if
he
already
had
these
documents
he
wouldn't
be
requesting...
it
wouldn't
be
requested.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
no,
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
one
of
the
other
exemptions--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
we
are
arguing
principally
a
here,
not
d.
we
are
arguing
interference
with
the...
with
the
ongoing
investigation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
by
a
criminal
law
enforcement
authority,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
the,
the
threshold,
it,
it
has...
the,
the...
all
of
exemption
7
has
an
additional
threshold,
which
is
that
the
act
doesn't
apply
to
records
or
information
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
and
then
each
of
the
subparagraphs
follows.
there
is
separate
requirement
for
a
law
enforcement
investigation
agency.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
that's...
that's
true.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
and
the
protection
against
any,
any
suggestion
of,
of
overreaching
or
abuse
is
to
check
to
see
whether
the
particular
record
or
information
satisfies
one
of
the
substantive
of
harms
that
congress
was
concerned
about.
in,
in...
in
abramson
this
court
said,
in,
in
construing
this
exact
compiled-for-law-enforcement-purposes
provision,
said
it
is
critical
that
the
compiled-for-law-enforcement
requirement
be
construed
to
avoid
the
release
of
information
that
would
produce
the
undesirable
result
specified.
and...
in
other
words,
the
court
said
that
the
exemption
has
to
be
construed
in
a
coherent
manner,
so
that,
so
that
information
the
congress
was
especially
concerned
about
wouldn't
fall
between
the
cracks.
and
i
think
it
is
significant
in
this
regard
that
congress
in
1986,
after
abramson,
amended
exemption
7(a)
and,
and...
to
provide
not
simply
that
records
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes,
but
also
information
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes,
could
be
withheld.
and
it
was
the
absence
of
the
word
information
that
was
of
significance
to
the
dissenters
in
abramson
because
the
act
at
that
point
only
referred
to
records.
and
in
fact
the
pertinent
senate
report,
as
this
court
recognized
in,
in
reporters
committee,
was
one
prepared
in
1983,
specifically
endorses
abram...
abramson
and
says
that
these
amendments
which
were
intended
to
ease
the
burden
of
law
enforcement
agencies
were
"intended
to
ensure
that
sensitive
law
enforcement
information
is
protected
under
exemption
7
regardless
of
the
particular
format
or
record
in
which...
in
which
the
record
is
maintained.
"
so,
it
is
obvious
that
congress
was
endorsing
the
view
that
this
court
took
in
abramson,
that
it
is
necessary
to
focus
on
whether
the
information
that
is
at
issue
would
produce,
as
long
as
it
is
categorized
or
identified
for
law
enforcement
purposes,
would
produce
one
of
the
six
enumerated
harms.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
that
is
what
i
was
attempting
to
say.
that
the
addition
of
the
word
information...
the
absence
of
the
word
information
was
of
particular
relevance
to
the
dissenters
in
abramson,
as
i
read
those
opinions,
and
congress
expanded
the
definition
specifically
to
include
information.
and
here,
there
is,
is
no
doubt
that
the
information
contained
in
these
records
is
now
compiled
by
the
fbi.
now,
copies
of
several...
of
some
pages
of
the
documents
were
retained
by
dcaa
when
the
entire
batch
was
sent
to
the
fbi,
but
that
doesn't
detract
from
the
fact
that
the
information
has
the
status
of
being
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
what
the
district
court
said
was
that
the...
that
the...
that
production
of
the
records
or
information
would
jeopardize,
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
jeopardize
the
grand
jury
investigation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
i
think...
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think...
i
think
by
grand
jury
investigation
the
district
court
meant
the
entire
investigation
under
the
control
of
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
which
included
the
submission
of
these,
these
documents
to
the
grand
jury.
i
mean,
these
documents
were
submitted
some
time
ago,
the
investigation
is
ongoing,
and
the
vaughn
index
and
interrogatories
that
were
prepared
in
this
case
were
submitted
under,
under
seal.
they
are
filed
with
the
clerk
of
this
court.
that...
the
vaughn
index
explains
in
considerable
detail
how
the
disclosure
of
these
records
would
interfere
with
the,
with
the
investigation.
and
this
court
in,
in
other
contexts
has
recognized
a
number
of
ways
in
which
that
might
happen.
in,
in
robbins
tire,
for
example
with
witness
statements,
the
court
recognized
that
premature
disclosure
of
witness
statements
could
lead
to
intimidation
or
correction
of
the
stories
of
witnesses.
the
disclosure
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
mean,
i
can't...
yes,
i,
i...
there...
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
in
a
public
affidavit
in,
in
support
of
a
stay
did
say
that
the...
that
the
records
might
disclose
the
identities
of
witnesses,
and
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
witnesses'
testimonies...
witnesses'
testimony
could
be
coached
in
a
way
that
would
interfere
with
an
investigation.
the
disclosure
of
the
records
would
also
show
the
direction
and,
and
strategy
of
the
investigation.
it
would
show
what
documents
the
government
had
and,
perhaps
more
significantly,
what
it
didn't
have.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
in
the
typical
case,
precisely
because
the
fbi
and
dcaa
do
work
as
a
team,
or
the
fbi
and
whatever
agency
work
as
a
team,
the
requestor
could
reasonably
expect
that
the...
that
the
records
in
the
hands
of
one
of
the
agencies
either
are
or
soon
will
be
part
of
the...
part
of
the
investigation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
would
show
what
records--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
government
had
at
its,
its
disposal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
that
has
been
one
of
the
principal
purposes
of
protecting
what...
of
exemption
7(a),
which
is
designed
to
prevent
premature
discovery,
as
was
particularly
recognized
in,
in
robbins
tire...
discovery
that
precedes
the
time
that
it
is
provided
for
under
the
rules
of
the
applicable
proceeding.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
not
necessarily
a
single
piece
of
paper.
it
could
mean
a
document
which
would
have
a
number
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
could
mean,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i,
i,
i
think
that's
one
of
the...
the...
that's
a
good
example
of
why
the
word
compiled
has
to
be
given
a
meaning
that
comports
with
the
overall
purposes
of
the
statute,
which
is
that
once
a
particular
document
has
become
the
subject
matter
or
included
in
the
subject
matter
of
the
investigation,
that
it
is
compiled.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
not...
when,
when
you're
speaking...
when
you're
speaking
of
a
confidential
source,
which
is
what
d
does,
that
protection
extends...
in
fact,
it
is
one
of
the
principal
purposes.
it
has
to
extend
beyond
the
time
of
the
investigation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but,
but
one
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--d
will
terminate
as
soon
as
the
compilation
is
eliminated.
no,
the
investigation
terminates,
but
under
this
court's
decision
in
abramson,
once
the
documents
are
originally...
or
become
compiled,
attain
the
status
of
being
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes,
at
that
point,
they
continue
their
protection
even
beyond
that
point,
and
it
is
critical
that
they
do
so.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
compiled
and
filed?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
in
many
cases
there
may
not
be
any.
i
think
the
work...
word...
i
think
the
word
filed--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--uh,
i'm,
i'm
not
sure
why
they
did.
i
think
compiled
has
a...
compiled
has
a
broader
connotation
that
suggests
the
categorization
of
the
records,
rather
than
the
physical
act
of
putting
them
in
a
file.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
respondent
asked
for
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
uh,
uh,
yes,
i,
i
think
it
does.
i,
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
specifically
recall.
i
think
it
was
the
respondent.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
have
no
objection
to,
to
lifting
it,
and,
and,
we
never
have,
particularly
with
respect
to
our,
our
agencies.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we
have
no...
we
have
no
objection
to
disclosing
the
names
of,
of
the
particular
agencies.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
we...
i
don't
think
we
asked
for
the...
i
could
be
wrong,
but
i
don't
think
we
asked
for
the,
for
the
protection
of
the,
of
the
two
agencies,
because
we
would
not
normally
care
about
the...
about
the
disclosure
of
the
identity
agencies.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you.
there
are
several
points
i'd
like
to
bring
to
the...
to
the
court's
attention
in,
in
the
discussion
that
is
focused
on
the
word
compiled.
i
think
it
is
important
to
understand
what
congress
was
driving
at
and
what
it...
what
the
responsible
agencies
understood
congress
to
be
driving
at.
because,
as
this
court
said
in
abramson,
exemption
7
is,
is
an
exemption
of
substance
and
not
one
of
technicalities.
the
first...
the
first
thing
i
want
to
point
out
is
a
passage
from
the
attorney
general's
memorandum,
page
6
of
the
attorney
general's
memorandum
on
the
1974
amendments
to
foia,
which
is
discussed
in
the
district
court's
opinion
in
hatcher,
which
is
discussed
in
the
briefs,
and
it's
the
same
page
of
the
attorney
general's
memorandum
that
was
discussed
by
this
court
in
footnote
5
of
abramson.
and
there
the
court
says...
or
there
the
attorney
general,
in
explaining
the
recently
enacted...
amendments,
states
that
although
ordinarily
records
used
in
monitoring
agencies
would
not...
or
activities,
would
not
be
covered
by
exemption
7,
it
then
continues
to
say
except
where
the
purpose
for
which
the
records
are
held
and
used
by
the
agency
becomes
substantially
violation
oriented,
i.e.,
becomes
refocused
on
preventing,
discovering
or
applying
sanctions
against
non-compliance
with
federal
statutes
or
regulations.
so
here
we
have
a
contemporaneous
construction
of
the
statute
by
the
attorney
general
in
a
memorandum
that
this
court
has
relied
upon
and
agencies
have
relied
on
ever
since,
saying
that
the
status
of
records,
once
they
become
refocused
on
a...
on
an
exemption,
is
relevant.
the
second
thing
is,
in
the
legislative
history
senator
philip
hart
of
michigan,
who
was
the
sponsor
of
the
amendment,
described
the
threshold
in
the
same
sort
of
pragmatic
terms
in
the
same
passage,
another
portion
of
which
the
court
discussed
in
robbins
tire.
the...
senator
hart
said
that
the
amendment
is
broadly
written,
but
he
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
material
cannot
be
exempt
merely
because
it
can
be
categorized,
he
used
that
word,
as
an
investigatory
file.
you
also
have
to
prove
one
of
the
six
harms.
but
he
did
use
the
word
categorized,
which
is
exactly
the
concept
that
we
are
trying
to...
explain
is
what
the...
what
the
amendment
refers
to.
and
then
he
says
in
broad
terms,
the
amendment...
the
exemption
would
apply
whenever
the
government's
case
in
court,
a
concrete
prospective
law
enforcement
proceeding,
would
be
harmed
by
the
premature
release
of
evidence
or
information
not
in
the
possession
of
known
or--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
has...
it
has...
it
has
to
be
focused
on
a
particular,
under,
under
7(a)
it
would
have
to
be
focused
on
a
particular
law
enforcement
proceeding
or
investigation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it,
it
would
have
to
be...
it
would
have
to
be
in
the
possession
for
law
enforcement
purposes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
other
words,
in,
in
dcaa
they
would
have
a
lot
of
information
but
once
it
becomes
refocused--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
doesn't...
well,
compiled,
compiled,
compiled
means--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
there...
there,
there
also
has
to
be
an
affirmative
designation
or
selection
of
the
document,
or
listing,
identification
of
the
document
as
germane
to
the
law
enforcement
investigation.
and
that,
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here
in
response
during
the
ten-day
period
when
the
agency
had
to
decide
whether
to
release
it
or,
or
keep
it.
it
concluded
that
it
was
relevant
to
the
investigation.
so
that
is
the
length
that
is
necessary.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
it...
it...
it's...
first
of
all,
a
court
may
be
able
to
examine
those
facts
and
see
whether
it
is
sufficiently
relevant
to
a
concrete,
focused
investigation.
and
secondly,
the
harms
that
exemption
7
are
designed
to
protect
against
is
the
principal
protection
against
an
overbroad
application
of
the
exemption.
