mr.
kneedler,
at
the
time
the
request
was
made
here,
had
the
documents
in
your
view
been
compiled
or
were
they
compiled
after
the
request
was
made?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
constituted
the
compilation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
request
by
the
agency
to
withhold
them
constitutes
a
compilation,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
what
you
are
asking
us
to
adopt
as
the
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
one
could
take
the
position
that
you
have
to
physically
assemble
the
documents
somehow,
i
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
depending
upon
the
timing.
now,
you
could
read
the
statute
as
meaning
they
have
to
be
compiled
when
the
request
is
made,
i
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
see.
i
thought
it
always
had
to
be
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--plus,
it
has
to
meet
a,
b,
c,
or
d.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
eisenberg,
doesn't
the
statute
for
exemption
7
give
the
agency
a
ten-day
period,
which
can
be
expanded
if
needed,
in
order
to
respond
and
in
order
to
determine
whether
the
records
should
be
compiled
for
law
enforcement
purposes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
is
an
interpretation
one
could
place
upon
the
statute,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
shouldn't
we
give
the
word
compiled
its
ordinary
meaning,
which
certainly
could
encompass
gathering
up
and
assembling
some
records
and
sending
them
over
to
the
fbi?
i,
i
mean,
that
would
certainly
be
a
plain,
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
compiled.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
to
gather
up
and
assemble?
