justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
sort
of
general
question?
do
you...
you
apply
the
same
theory
to
criminal
jurisdiction?
unless
the
man
committed
the
crime
in
the
state
he
can't
be
apprehended
when
he
goes
through
and
then
extradited?
justice
stevens
say...
say
somebody
commits
a
crime
in
nevada
and
they
send
out
an
all
points
bulletin
and
he's
hitchhiking
through
new
mexico
and...
but
he's
not...
doesn't
intend
to
stay
there,
had
no
contacts
at
all
whatsoever,
but
they
arrest
him
and
extradite
him.
i
guess
that...
you'd
have
no
power
to
do
that.
justice
stevens
but
you--
justice
stevens
--well,
forum
nonconvenience
allows
that.
they
can
shift
the
lawsuit
back.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
the
only
way
you
get
jurisdiction
over
him
is
in
the
gotcha
theory.
justice
stevens
that's
right.
you--
justice
stevens
--but
your
power
to
do
it
is
based
entirely
on
the
fact
that
he's...
he
happens
to
be
passing
through
the
state.
justice
stevens
i
don't
know
why
that's
any
more
unfair
than--
justice
stevens
--or
any
less
unfair
than
what
you
say.
justice
stevens
well,
that's
true.
but--
justice
stevens
--there's
a
legal
proceeding
in
the
state
of
arrest,
namely,
the
extradition
hearing
and
he
might
conceivably
win
there.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
i
don't
know
why
he--
justice
stevens
--i
don't
know
why
the
criminal--
justice
stevens
--defendant
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
have
his
motion
granted
also
on
your
theory.
i
don't
know
why...
because
the
only
thing...
the
only
basis
for
jurisdiction
over
him
is
he
happened
to
be
there.
well,
anyway,
that's
a
different
case,
i
guess.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
stronger
case
than...
well,
anyway,
go
ahead.
