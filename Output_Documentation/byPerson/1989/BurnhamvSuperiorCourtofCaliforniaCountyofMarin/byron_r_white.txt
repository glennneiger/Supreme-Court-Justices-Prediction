well,
the
minimum
contacts
really...
test,
though,
really
developed
on
when
is
service
outside
the
state
satisfactory.
justice
white
and
international
shoe
i
thought
seemed
to
recognize
the
validity
of
the
so-called
gotcha.

xxx
pennoyer
was
irrational.
justice
white
well,
i
don't
know.
it
seemed
to
recognize
pennoyer.
it
didn't
overturn...
overturn
pennoyer.
justice
white
do
you
think...
do
you
think
we
really...
this
case
really...
is
it
really
necessary
in
this
case
for
us
to
decide
this
issue?
it
seems...
isn't
it
open...
isn't
the
issue
open
as
whether
there
were
plenty
of
contacts
here
anyway
besides
just
presence?
justice
white
but
here's
a...
but
it
said
in
light
of
the
evidence
presented
to
the
trial
court,
the
petitioner's...
within
california
was
for
the
dual
purposes
of
visitation
and
conducting
business
activities.
justice
white
so
the
imposition
of
personal
jurisdiction
in
this
case
will
not
affect...
will
not
act
to
discourage
parental
visitation.
justice
white
i
understand.
justice
white
but
nevertheless--
justice
white
--we...
we
judge
this
case...
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
he
wasn't
just
there;
he
was
there
conducting
business.
justice
white
well,
maybe
we
don't
have--
justice
white
--to
hold
that,
but
i
don't...
if
that
was...
if
that's
the
case--
justice
white
--maybe
we
made
a
mistake
granting
the
case.
justice
white
i
suppose
if
all
that
the
wife
wanted
to
do
was
to
change
custody,
she
could
have
served
him
out
of
state.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
xxx.
justice
white
so,
we've
been
stuck
with
these
examples
for
a
long
time?
justice
white
well,
the
end
result
of
this
approach
is
the
state
ought
to
be
able
to
serve
him
anywhere.
justice
white
so
you
think...
you
think
he
could
have
been
served
in
new
york?
justice
white
under
a
long-arm
statute.
justice
white
but
is
that
issue
open
to
us
in
this
case?
justice
white
is
that
issue
open
to
us
in
this
case?
justice
white
but
the
rationale
of
the
court
below
was
personal
presence
is
enough.
that's
all.
justice
white
and
you're
arguing
that
that's
an
alternative
ground
for--
justice
white
--but
it
was
raised
below?
