justice
scalia
mr.
sherman--
justice
scalia
--this
sort
of
points
out...
points
up
one
of
the
problems
with...
with
abandoning
the
gotcha
test.
one
of
the
nice
things
about
the
gotcha
test
was
that
it
made
very
simple
the
preliminary
question
of
jurisdiction,
which
ought
to
be
simple,
it
being
a
preliminary
question.
it's
very
silly
to
have
to
litigate
about
that
and
what
you're
saying
is
by
abandoning
the
gotcha
test
we're
going
to
have
to
look
in
every
single
case
to
see
whether
the
individual
is
not
only
served...
or...
or
the
state
courts
will...
not
only
whether
the
individual
was
served
there
but
whether
the
suit
pertains
to
his
presence
there
and
so
forth.
it's
a
big
deal.
justice
scalia
but
for
200
years--
justice
scalia
it's
clear
that
one
way
you...
you
can
place
the
jurisdiction
in
the
case
just
beyond
doubt
is
you
serve
the
individual
in
the
jurisdiction.
i
mean,
yeah,
there
are
a
lot
of
refinements
as
to
other
ways
that
you
may
get
him,
but
up
until
now
you
have
known
that.
one
way
to
be
sure,
you
serve
him.
justice
scalia
that...
that
would
be
gone?
justice
scalia
mr.
sherman,
if...
if
we
can't
look
to
500
years,
or
however
long
it
is
of...
of
the
common
law
as
to
what,
you
know,
fundamental
fairness
requires...
we
can't
really
on
that...
and
we
can't
even
rely
on
the
american
law
institute,
where...
where
do
we
search--
justice
scalia
--for
this...
for
this
principle
of
what
fundamental
fairness
requires?
justice
scalia
but
this
is
a
contact.
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--physical
presence
is
a
contact.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
everything
is
a
contact
of
sorts.
justice
scalia
and
our...
our
tradition
would
seem
to
show
that
it's...
that
it's
enough
of
a
contact.
justice
scalia
why
not?
justice
scalia
i
assume
that
the
state...
the
state
supreme
courts
can
deem
it
outmoded
as
far
as
their
states
are
concerned
or
the
state
legislatures.
justice
scalia
right?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
right.
justice
scalia
but
what...
what
is...
what
is
consistent
with
due
process
under
the
federal
constitution?
i
mean,
we...
we...
we
might
decide
that
this
has
been
around
for
too
long
for
us
to
say
that
it
isn't
in
accordance
with
due
process,
whereas
the
state
supreme
courts,
i
assume,
would
be
freer
than
we
were.
justice
scalia
well,
they'd
have
no
choice
if
we
did.
justice
scalia
what
about...
what
about
state
legislatures?
justice
scalia
well,
then...
then
how
do
we
know
this
is
inconsistent
with
fundamental
principles
of
fairness
if
the
state...
state
courts
haven't
thought
so...
and
they
certainly
could
do
it
under
state
law.
they're...
they're
not
bound
by
us
on
that.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
i
think
they
could
say,
as
a
matter
of
our
state
constitution,
we
don't
think
it's...
it's
appropriate,
right?
and
the
state
legislatures
could
certainly
decline
to
exercise
this
kind
of
offensive
jurisdiction.
and
how
many
state
legislatures
have
abandoned
it?
justice
scalia
nobody.
justice
scalia
they're
not
bound
by
pennoyer.
we
didn't
say
that
states
must
exercise
this
jurisdiction.
we
just
said
that
they
may
exercise
this
jurisdiction.
justice
scalia
that
it's
constitutional
if
they
choose
to
do
it.
justice
scalia
and
it's
constitutional
if
they
choose
not
to
do
it,
too.
justice
scalia
you're...
you're
not
disagreeing
then
with
your...
with
your
opponent
here.
you
say
we
should
just
look
at
each
case
and
decide
whether
it's
fair
or
not.
that's
what
you
want
us
to
do
in
this
case.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
if
that's
the
invitation,
frankly,
i
don't
think
the
mere
fact
that...
that
this
person
happened
to
be
there
to
see
his
daughter...
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
very
fair.
justice
scalia
well,
maybe
we
should
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals
to...
to
decide
whether...
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
purport
to
decide
it
on
a
totality
of
fairness
basis,
did
it?
justice
scalia
no?
justice
scalia
then
it--
justice
scalia
--but
you're
saying
it
isn't.
you're
saying
it's--
justice
scalia
--the
totality
of
everything.
justice
scalia
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
you
either
want
us
to
decide
it
on
the
basis
that
presence
is
enough,
and
we
either
decide
it
or
don't
decide
it
on
that
basis,
or
else
you
say
it
isn't
necessarily
enough
and
we
ought
to
remand
it
to
the
court
of
appeals.
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can...
how
you
can
have
it
both
ways.
justice
scalia
mr.
devereaux,
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
cert.
and
on
which
i
thought
we
had...
we
had
granted
cert.
and
what
i
thought
we
were
here
to
decide
or
what
you
were
here
for
us
to
decide,
is
this:
is
service
of
process
on
a
nonresident
defendant
while
he
is
physically
present
in
the
forum
state
a
sufficient
basis
by
itself
for
the
exercise
of
personal
jurisdiction.
now,
you
are
inviting
us
to
decide
it
not
on...
this
case
not
on
this
ground,
but
to
decide
whether
in
the
particular
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
particular
controversy
there
was
enough
contact.
frankly,
that's
not
an
issue
that's
of
sufficient
national
importance
to
have...
to
have
warranted
the
attention
that
this
court
has
given
to
this
case.
i
thought
what
we
accepted
cert.
on
was
whether
physical
presence
alone
is
enough.
justice
scalia
do
you
think
the
state
has
physical
power
of
somebody
flying
overhead
in
an
airplane?
justice
scalia
physical
power
over
that--
justice
scalia
--over
that
person?
