mr.
richard
sherman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
here
is
whether
a
state
can
exercise
personal
jurisdiction
over
a
nonresident
defendant
who
was
personally
served
while
present
in
the
state
if
that
defendant
does
not
otherwise
have
sufficient
contacts
with
the
state
to
satisfy
the
minimum
contacts
test
announced
in
international
shoe.
the
issue
arises
in
the
following
context.
the
parties
lived
virtually
all
their
married
lives
in
new
jersey.
the
split
up
in
1987.
they
had
two
children
about
ages
2
and
8
at
the
time,
and
they
entered
into
a
marital
settlement
agreement
resolving
everything
in
new
jersey.
the
wife
then
moved
to
california
with
the
children,
as
planned,
and
husband
filed
for
dissolution
in
new
jersey
and
asked
the
court
to
incorporate
their
marital
settlement
agreement.
before
he
served
mrs.
burnham
with
his
petition,
she
filed
an
action
in
california
for
legal
separation
and
filed
him
after
he
brought
the
children
back
from
visiting
with
them
to
her
home
in
mill
valley,
california.
mr.
burnham
moved
to
quash
service
arguing
that
he
did
not
have
sufficient
minimum
contacts
under
kulko,
international
shoe
and
similar
cases
and
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
shaffer
v.
heitner
the
fact
that
he
was
served
in
california
was
no
longer
relevant
at
all.
the
trial
court
initially
agreed
with
mr.
burnham
and
granted
his
motion,
in
part
holding
that
there
were
not
sufficient
minimum
contacts
and
there
was
no
personal
jurisdiction.
it
reconsidered
that
order
when
mrs.
burnham's
attorney
convinced
it
that
the
fact
that
he
was
served
in
the
forum
was
sufficient
and
that
notwithstanding
what
this
court
held
in
shaffer
and
the
language
in
shaffer,
personal
service
is
still
sufficient.
the
court
of
appeal
denied
the
petition
for
a
writ
in
a
decision
which,
again,
said
that
shaffer,
the
language
in
shaffer,
had
not
changed
the
traditional
rule...
it
goes
by
the
nickname
of
transient
jurisdiction.
it
relied
on
cases
such
as
the
supreme
court's
case
in
nevada,
cariaga
which
had
said
this
court
has
never
directly
held
that
transient
jurisdiction
is
no
good
so
we
will
apply
it
until
we
are
instructed
otherwise.
we're
here
today
to
ask
you
to
instruct
the
courts
of
this
land
otherwise,
to
give
effect
to
what
the
court
said
in
shaffer,
that
personal
jurisdiction
in
all
cases
must
be
tested
by
the
minimum
contacts
test.
now,
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
although
the
doctrine
is
often
called
transient
jurisdiction
or
sometimes,
more
colorfully,
gotcha
jurisdiction,
what's
really
at
issue
is
not
whether
the
defendant
is
passing
through
momentarily.
what's
at
issue
is
whether
the
fact
of
service
on
a
defendant
while
he
is
in
the
forum
is
alone
sufficient.
the
traditional
view
that
it
was
founded
on
the
notion
that...
what
jurisdiction
is
all
about,
what
personal
jurisdiction
is
all
about
is
whether
the
state
has
power
over
the
defendant,
physical
power
over
the
defendant.
and
it
does,
according
to
the
traditional
view,
when
a
defendant
is
within
its
boundaries.
that
view
was
long
criticized
by
the
commentators
and
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
international
shoe
and
then
again
in
shaffer.
that
power,
physical
power
over
the
defendant
is
not
fundamentally
the
basis
for
the
exercise
of
state
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
sherman
well--
mr.
richard
sherman
--i
think
not,
your
honor.
and
it's
important
to
distinguish--
mr.
richard
sherman
--that...
that--
mr.
richard
sherman
--on
that...
on
those
facts,
yes.
if
he
were
just
passing
through
momentarily,
say,
stopping
over
on
his
way
to
hawaii,
not
conducting
any
business
or--
mr.
richard
sherman
--classically
flying
over--
mr.
richard
sherman
--right.
mr.
richard
sherman
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
sherman
but
the
question
that
your
hypothetical
poses
is
what
kinds
of
contacts
would
be
sufficient
under
the
minimum
contacts
test
for
somebody
who
was
not
in
the
state
very
long.
and
the
answer
to
that
would
depend
upon
applying
the
minimum
contacts
test
and
typically
the
cause
of
action
has
to
be
related
to
or
rise
out
of
contacts
that
the
defendant
has.
and
in
your
example,
for
instance,
if
somebody
is...
is
in
the
state
transacting
some
business,
even
though
they
are
there
very
briefly,
if
there
is
a
cause
of
action
that
the
plaintiff
has
against
that
defendant
that
arises
out
of
his
transacting
that
business,
there's
no
question
that
under
the
minimum
contacts
test--
mr.
richard
sherman
--there
would
be
a
restriction.
mr.
richard
sherman
well,
your
honor,
if
there
were
no
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
constitution
and
we
didn't
have
to
worry
about
due
process
and
we're
looking
for
an
easy
test,
then
that
might
be
an
easy
test
that
a
court
would
want
to--
mr.
richard
sherman
--well,
that's
true.
it's
been
around
for
a
long
time.
but
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
was
around
for
a
long
time
too
and
this
court
said
in
shaffer
that
it
was
fundamentally
unfair
and
did
not
comport
with
the
fourteenth
amendment
and,
notwithstanding
its
lineage,
it
was
consigned
to
the
dustbin
of
judicial
history.
mr.
richard
sherman
i
think
what
most
people
would
think
is
if
you're
within
the
borders
of
the
state,
you're
subject
to
the
power,
if
you
will,
of
the
state.
if
you
do
something
in
the
state
that's
wrong,
they
can
arrest
you.
if
you're
injured,
you
can
go
to
the
hospital
and
get
treated.
and
if
a
cause
of
action
arises
out
of
those
activities,
i
think
a
defendant
could
rightfully
expect
to
be
sued
on
them.
but
if
you
are
in
the
state
for
reasons
which
do
not
give
rise
to
the
cause
of
action
that
is
sued
on,
then
i
don't
think
you
would
expect
to
be
subject
to
a
lawsuit
over
them,
which
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
sherman
that's
true.
and
i
think
the
interesting--
mr.
richard
sherman
--well,
i
think
there's
kind
of
been
a
mistaken
understanding
of
what
that
phrase
meant.
the
courts...
not
this
court
because
it
hasn't
addressed
it,
obviously,
but
the
state
courts
that
have
addressed
it...
have
looked
at
international
shoe
and
have
said
if...
the
language
there,
if
the
defendant
be
not
present
in
the
forum.
but
the
issue
is
not
if
the
defendant
be
not
present
in
the
form.
it's
if
the
defendant
be
not
served
while
present
in
the
forum.
if
i
have...
say
i'm...
i'm
a
plaintiff
and
i...
in
new
york
i
enter
into
a
contract
with
two
defendants
in
new
york
and
those
two
defendants
then
decide
to
take
a
trip
to
hawaii
and
they
both
got
to
hawaii
contemplating
a
two-week
trip.
and
there's
a
dispute
between
us
that
arose
in
new
york
over
the
validity
of
that
contract
and
i
decide
to
sue
them
in
new
york.
so
i
file
a
lawsuit
in
new
york
and
i
get
my
process
server
to
go
to
hawaii
and
i
serve
one
of
them
who
has
been
there
for
a
week
and
then...
i'm
sorry,
i
want
this
lawsuit
to
be
in
hawaii,
not
in
new
york.
i
serve
them...
one
of
them
in
hawaii
who
has
been
there
for
a
week
and
he
calls
the
other
fellow
and
he
says,
the
process
server
is
here,
you'd
better
leave,
and
that
person
leaves
a
week
later.
he's
been
there
twice
as
long
and
has
twice
as
many
contacts,
he's
not
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
hawaii.
but
the
first
fellow
is
because
the
process
server
happened
to
catch
him.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
an
irrational
result.
mr.
richard
sherman
well,
that's
correct.
i
think
this
court
said
as
much
in
international
shoe
and
then
in
shaffer.
mr.
richard
sherman
i
think
it
overturned
the
theoretical
underpinning
of
pennoyer
when
it
said
that
power
was
no
longer
the
basis
of
jurisdiction.
it's
true
that
was
in
the
context
of
out-of-state
defendants,
but
the
reasoning
of
the
decision
was
to
reject
the
notion
that
power
was
the
basis
of
jurisdiction.
that's
why
you
can
get
jurisdiction
over
out-of-state
defendants
after
international
shoe,
because
power
is
not
the
basis
for
jurisdiction.
if
power
is
not
the
basis
for
jurisdiction,
then
the
fact
that
you
physically
get
power
over
the
defendant
no
longer
can
be
the
basis
for
jurisdiction
either.
but
going
back
to
the
question--
mr.
richard
sherman
--i
really
do
not
know
enough
about
criminal
law--
mr.
richard
sherman
--well,
i
don't
know
enough
about
criminal
law
to
give
the
best
answer
to
that.
mr.
richard
sherman
but
my
off-the-cuff
answer
would
be
that
although
the
state
may
have
the
power,
because
it's
given
the
right
to
do
so
by
this
court,
to
arrest
the
defendant
and
to
ship
him
back
to
the
other
state,
extradite
him,
that
the
analogy
in
the
civil
case
would
be
that
if
the
defendant
is
served
in
the
law...
in
the
forum,
that
the
state
then
can
shift
the
lawsuit...
should
shift
the
lawsuit
back
to
the
original--
mr.
richard
sherman
--but...
well,
but
the
extradition
is
mandatory,
is
it
not,
in
your
hypothetical?
it
has
to
go
back
to
be
tried
in
the
state
where
he
was
from,
where
he
committed
the
act.
mr.
richard
sherman
no.
the
only
way
you
get
jurisdiction
over
him
in
a
criminal
case
is
you
actually
arrest
him.
mr.
richard
sherman
but
the
purpose
of
arresting
him--
mr.
richard
sherman
--that's
true,
but--
mr.
richard
sherman
--but
the--
mr.
richard
sherman
--but
the
consequence
of
your
hypothetical
is
that
the
defendant
winds
up
being
tried
in
the
state
of
origin.
mr.
richard
sherman
and
the
analogy--
mr.
richard
sherman
--well,
but
in
the
civil
case
the
analogy
would
be
there's
a
civil
proceeding
in
california
and
he
is
served
in
california
and
then
he
makes
his
motion
to
quash
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
and
it's
granted,
and
the
case
then
goes
back
to
new
jersey.
mr.
richard
sherman
because
he
doesn't
have
sufficient--
mr.
richard
sherman
--contacts--
mr.
richard
sherman
--there's
no
more
i
can
say
about
that.
i'd
like
to
advert
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
for
a
moment
about
a
bright-line
rule
and
point
out
that
things
are
(a)
not
so
simple
even
under
pennoyer
because
even
under
pennoyer,
with
respect
to
out-of-state
defendants,
in
order
to
allow
there
to
be
jurisdiction
over
out-of-state
defendants
all
kinds
of
fictions
and
exceptions
were
created
in...
post-pennoyer,
like
in
hess.
i
mean,
if
you
drive
in
the
state,
you
would
priorly
consent
that
the
registrar
of
motor
vehicles
is
your
agent
for
service
of
process.
i
mean,
there
are
all
kinds
of
exceptions
that
were
created.
it
was
not
simple
prior...
under
the
pennoyer
regime.
now,
if
it
were--
mr.
richard
sherman
--well--
mr.
richard
sherman
--that's
true.
the
second...
second
part
of
my
answer
to
your
question
is
that
in
stanley
v.
illinois
and
in
shaffer
this
court
said
that
due
process
should
not
be
sacrificed
for
the
sake
of
simplicity,
that
the
cost
is
too
high.
and
justice
marshall
in
shaffer
said
that
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction,
traditional
though
it
may
be,
and
easy
to
apply
though
it
may
be,
is
not
consistent
with
fundamental
notions
of
due
process.
and
the
fact
that
it's
easy
and
simple
and
eliminates
cost
is
not
sufficient
for
constitutional
scrutiny.
mr.
richard
sherman
i
think
there
are
several
problems
with
it.
it's
obviously
somewhat
of
an
improvement
over
the
traditional
rule
because
it
allows
for
exceptions.
however,
i
think
there
are
three
things
wrong
with
it.
the
first
is
that
it
starts
from
the
notion
that
the
service--
mr.
richard
sherman
--there
is
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
sherman
that's
right.
and
the
basis
for
that,
i
believe,
is
that
the
restaters
were
unwilling
to
give
up
the
notion
that
jurisdiction
is
fundamentally
based
on
power.
mr.
richard
sherman
that's
true.
but
in
order
to
accept
it
jurisprudentially
i
think
this
court
would
have
to
say
that
its
prior
decisions
which
indicated
that
jurisdiction
is
not
fundamentally
based
upon
power
are
incorrect,
that
in
one
sense
jurisdiction
is
to
be
continually
based
upon
power
although
the
defendant
can
then
show
reasons
why
it
shouldn't
be
exercised...
then
jurisdiction
will
not
be
exercised.
mr.
richard
sherman
well,
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeal
opinion,
which
you
are
reviewing,
refused
to
issue
a
petition...
refused
to
grant
the
petition
for
writ
of
mandate
and
compel
the
trial
court
to
quash
the
service
because
it
held
that
service
on
the
defendant
while
he
is
present
in
the
forum
is
still
a
basis
for
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
sherman
that's
correct.
that
is--
mr.
richard
sherman
--that's
correct.
your
honor,
the
reason
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
is
it
was
responding
to
our
argument--
mr.
richard
sherman
--as
to...
so--
mr.
richard
sherman
--it
was
not--
mr.
richard
sherman
--that's
true.
that's
true.
but
the
court
of
appeal
opinion
was
not
upholding
jurisdiction
on
the
ground
that
he
was
conducting
business.
mr.
richard
sherman
and
it
couldn't
have--
mr.
richard
sherman
--it
doesn't
say
that--
mr.
richard
sherman
--it
doesn't
say
that
jurisdiction
was
being
upheld
on
the
ground
that
he
has
sufficient
contacts
under
the
minimum
contacts
test,
and
it
couldn't
have
because
it
was
quite
obvious
that
the
trial
court
did
not
ground
jurisdiction
on
that
basis,
and
it
couldn't
have
because
under
california
law
and
under
this
court's
decisions
there
are
insufficient
contacts
as
a
matter
of
law
to
uphold
jurisdiction
here
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
doing
business
in
a
state
only
gives
rise
to
jurisdiction
under
the
traditional
test,
if
that's
what
the
court
thought
it
was
applying,
or
if
that's
what
this
court
wanted
to
apply,
for
causes
of
action
arising
out
of
that
business.
and
the
cause
of
action
here
does
not
arise
out
of
the
business
that
mr.
burnham
did
in
california.
the
wife
is
seeking
to
invalidate
a
marital
settlement
agreement
that
she
executed
in
new
jersey.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
husband's
contacts
in
california.
secondly,
california
has
held
in
modlin
v.
superior
court,
which
is
in
our
briefs,
that
if
a
person,
a
father,
combines
coming
to
a
state
to
visit
his
children
with
doing
some
business,
the
combination
of
those
do
not
meet
the
minimum
contacts
test.
that's
modlin
v.
superior
court,
176
cal.
app.
3d
1176.
so,
the
court
of
appeal--
mr.
richard
sherman
--that's
correct
because
under
the
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act
you
don't
need
personal
jurisdiction--
mr.
richard
sherman
--over
the
defendant
in
order
to
adjudicate
status
of
the
children.
but
the
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act
explicitly
says
that
you
don't
then
litigate
support
issues.
mr.
richard
sherman
the
minimum
contacts--
mr.
richard
sherman
--you
just...
you
just
apply
the
minimum
contacts
test
across
the
board.
mr.
richard
sherman
well--
mr.
richard
sherman
--that's
true.
that's
true.
mr.
richard
sherman
that's
true.
and
i--
mr.
richard
sherman
--no,
because--
mr.
richard
sherman
--because
the
tradition
does
not
found
jurisdiction
on
the
fact
that
a
person
is
present.
it
founds
jurisdiction
on
the
fact
that,
while
present,
the
person
is
served.
now,
you
can
do
away
with
the
gotcha
theory
of
jurisdiction
and
still
say
that
if
a
person
is
present
in
the
state,
he
has
a
contact
with
the
state.
there's
no
question
about
that.
the
question
is
what
significance
does
his
contact
have
in
assessing
whether
or
not
the
minimum
contacts
test
of
international
shoe
is
met.
mr.
richard
sherman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
thinking
about
this
matter
over
the
lunch
hour
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
ought
to
say
that
we're
really
not
asking
this
court
to
do
anything
very
radical.
although
it's
true
that
the
doctrine
of
transient
jurisdiction
has
been
around
for
a
long
time,
there
has
been
an
evolution
in
the
law
which
has
pointed
in
the
direction
of
abolishing
it.
in
fact,
in
shaffer
at
page
213
the
court
said,
"we
therefore
conclude
that
all
assertions
of
state
court
jurisdiction
must
be
evaluated
according
to
the
standards
set
forth
in
international
shoe.
"
that's
been
quoted
very
often.
however,
there's
a
footnote
to
that
sentence
which
has
not
been
quoted
very
often,
and
it
says,
"it
would
not
be
fruitful
for
us
to
reexamine
the
facts
of
cases
decided
on
the
rationales
of
pennoyer
and
harris
to
determine
whether
jurisdiction
might
be
sustained
under
the
standards
we
adopt
today.
"
"to
the
extent
that
prior
decisions
are
inconsistent
with
this
standard,
they
are
overruled.
"
so,
already
in
shaffer
the
court
had
recognized
that
the
law
was
moving
in
the
direction
of
being
concerned
with
fundamental
fairness.
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
old
rule
coming
out
of
pennoyer,
it
perhaps
was
fair
in
1877
to
say
that,
since
you
can't
get
service
on
the
defendant
outside
the
jurisdiction,
if
you're
lucky
enough
to
catch
him
in
the
jurisdiction,
well,
you've
gotten
him
and
you've
got
jurisdiction
over
him.
but
after
international
shoe
liberalized
the
degree
to
which
you
could
get
jurisdiction
over
the
defendant
by
service
outside
the
forum,
the
rationale
for
saying
that
you
can
get
jurisdiction
over
him
by
serving
him
in
the
forum
was
totally
undercut.
therefore,
if
you
abolish
the
doctrine
of
transient
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
all
you're
doing
is
kind
of
completing
a
trio
of
cases
that
started
with
international
shoe,
shaffer
and
now
this
case.
unless
you
do
something
to
the
doctrine
of
transient
jurisdiction,
we're
stuck
with
cases
like
grace
v.
macarthur
where
you're
served
if
you're
flying
over
and
have
no
contacts.
you're
stuck
with
cases
where
the
defendant
comes
into
the
forum
and
just
steps
over
the
line
and
is
served
with
a
piece
of
paper.
you're
stuck
with
cases
where
somebody
is
on
the
way
to
hawaii
and
the
plane
lands
in
san
francisco
airport
and
they're
served
and
have
no
other
contacts
with
san
francisco.
none
of
those
things
would
seem
to
comport
with
fundamental
notions
of
fair
play
and
substantial
justice.
mr.
richard
sherman
that's
true.
but
the
point
of
those
examples
is
that
if
you
don't
do
anything
to
the
doctrine
of
transient
jurisdiction,
that's
where
the
law
will
be
left.
so
i
urge
the
court
to
keep
the
case--
mr.
richard
sherman
--that's
true.
it
has
been
there.
that's
why
grace
was
decided
the
way
it
was.
but
the
reason
it
was
there--
mr.
richard
sherman
--that's
true.
and
the
time
has
come
to
liberate
us
from
them
and
to
make
sure
that
they
don't
happen
again.
that
was
the
whole
point
of
international
shoe
and
shaffer.
we
were
stuck
with
the
doctrine
of
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
for
a
long
time.
but
it
finally
was
recognized
that
it
was
outmoded
and
it
was
no
longer
necessary
and
the
court
abolished
it.
mr.
richard
sherman
well--
mr.
richard
sherman
--this
court
presides
over
the
area
of
personal
jurisdiction
because
it
interprets
what
is
consistent
with
the
fundamental
due
process--
mr.
richard
sherman
--protections
that
defendants
have.
mr.
richard
sherman
well,
the
problem
i
see
with
that
is
the
state
supreme
courts
have
been
loath
to
overturn
the
doctrine
precisely
because
this
court
has
not.
i
mean,
you
have--
mr.
richard
sherman
--well,
that's...
that's
true.
on
the
other
hand,
it
doesn't
seem
as
if
any
state
court,
high
court,
has
been
willing
to,
as
judge
goldberg
said
so
colorfully
in
mordelt,
to
ferry
the
rule
across
the
river
styx
without
instructions
from
this
court.
so,
nobody
seems
to
be
willing
to
take
that
step
because
they
feel
bound
by
pennoyer
v.
neff.
mr.
richard
sherman
i
don't
know
of
any
legislature
that
has
seen
fit
to...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they've
all
gone
the
other
way,
as
california
has,
and
enacted
a
long-arm
statute
that
says
we
have
jurisdiction
if
it's
consistent
with
the
constitution.
and
this
court
tells
states
what's
consistent
with
the
constitution.
mr.
richard
sherman
well--
mr.
richard
sherman
--not
to
my
knowledge
any.
mr.
richard
sherman
but
there
is--
mr.
richard
sherman
--that's
true.
but
i
think
the
more
fundamental
question
is
that
the
reason
that
they
don't
do
it
is
because
they
perceive
that
they're
bound
by
pennoyer.
they
don't
perceive,
i
think,
that
they
have
the
freedom
to
do
it.
because
if
you
read
all
of
the
state
court
decisions,
they
all
look
to
this
court
and
say,
well,
what
has
the
supreme
court
ruled?
mr.
richard
sherman
that
it's
constitutional
if
they
choose
to
do
it.
mr.
richard
sherman
and
they
have--
mr.
richard
sherman
--and
they
have
statutes
which
say
they
may
exercise
jurisdiction
to
the
full
extent
permitted
by
the
constitution.
there's...
there
are
two
additional
reasons
why...
coming
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question
earlier
today...
why
i
think
the
court
should
not
adopt
the
restatement
view
if
the
court
is
willing
to
abolish
the
pure
form
of
transient
jurisdiction
which
makes
everything
turn
on
service.
the
first
is
that
it
would
accomplish
a
shift
in
the
burden.
traditionally
it's
the
plaintiff...
when
the
defendant
objects
to
jurisdiction,
it's
the
plaintiff
that
has
the
burden
of
establishing
a
basis
for
jurisdiction.
this
would
put
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
disprove
why...
to
prove
why
there
should
not
be
jurisdiction.
and
that
would
be
an
incentive
for
plaintiffs
to
lure
defendants
to
the
state
and
to
serve
them,
as
happened
in
this
case,
in
a
way
that
would
interfere
with
other
interests.
and
i
think
it
would
be
better
if
there
was
one
standard
that
is
consistently
applied
in
making
the
plaintiff
establish
jurisdiction.
secondly,
if
you
do
the
restatement
view,
the
restatement
says
jurisdiction
is
served
in
the
forum
unless
otherwise
unreasonable.
this
court
would
then
have
to
begin
a
process
of
deciding
numerous
cases
to
define
the
parameters
of
what's
reasonable
and
unreasonable
under
the
restatement
test.
there's
already
a
body
of
law
from
this
court
under
the
minimum
contacts
test
defining
what's
reasonable
and
unreasonable,
and
it
would
be
much
simpler
for
everybody
if
that
body
of
law
was
just
engrafted
on
to
all
assertions
of
state
court
jurisdiction.
finally,
i
close
my
opening
comments
this
afternoon
by
saying
that
if
the
court
determines
that
the
rule
has
been
around
so
long
that
we
should
keep
it
even
though
it
may
have
unfair
results,
it
shouldn't
be
applied
in
a
case
where
somebody
is
served
in
the
state
while
they're
visiting
their
children,
which
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
fundamentally
that
in
asahi
this
court...
and
in
world-wide
volkswagen
this
court
made
clear
that
one
of
the
things
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
state
is
exercising
jurisdiction
consistent
with
the
constitution
is
the
degree
to
which
it
impacts
upon
the
shared
substance
and
policies
of
the
states.
i
don't
think
it's
beyond
question
that
the
share
and
substantive
policy
of
the
states
in
the
area
of
child
custody
visitation
is
to
encourage
families
of
divorce
to
maintain
contact
between
parents
and
the
children
after
the
divorce.
that
policy
will
be
impacted
adversely
by
allowing
transient
jurisdiction
in
a
case
where
somebody
is
served
while
they're
visiting
their
children.
therefore,
if
the
court
does
not
totally
abolish
the
rule
and
if
the
court
does
not
accept
the
restatement
formulation,
or
even
if
it
does,
one
of
the
things
that
it
should
say,
it's
unreasonable
to
allow
jurisdiction
to
be
predicated
upon
service
on
somebody
who
is
in
the
state
when
they're
seeing
their
children.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
richard
sherman
yes.
i
think
that
counsel
kind
of
concedes
that
grace
v.
macarthur
is
unfair.
it
offends
our
traditional
notions
of
what's
fair.
the
next
step
is
to
say
that
that
means
that
since
it's
a
question
of
fairness,
it
has
to
be
fact-specific
to
each
case.
and
that's
the
nature
of
due
process.
that's
the
nature
of
the
inquiry
into
due
process.
it
has
to
be,
and
that
is
why
in
kulko
the
court
said
in
this
area
the
grays
predominate.
and
they
have
to
because
otherwise,
if
you're
stuck
with
this
absolute
notion
that
physical
power
is
what
jurisdiction
is
about,
then
you're
stuck
with
grace
v.
macarthur
and
nobody
seriously
defends
that.
mr.
richard
sherman
well--
mr.
richard
sherman
--well,
if
the--
mr.
richard
sherman
--if
the
territory
of
the
state
extends
to
the
air
space,
then
apparently
they
do.
but
it's
not,
as
i
started
to
say
before
the
lunch
bell
rang,
it's
not
because
they're
present
in
the
state;
it's
because
they
were
served
while
present
in
the
state.
you
see,
service
while
present
is
what
accomplished
transient
jurisdiction.
i'm
not
contending
that
if
somebody
is
present
in
the
state
that
should
not
be
counted
in
the
minimum
contacts
analysis.
if
a
person
is
present,
he
has
a
contact.
but
then
he's
only
subject
to
specific
jurisdiction
for
causes
of
action
relating
to
his
presence.
if
he
is
served
under
the
traditional
rule,
he's
subject
to
general
jurisdiction
for
anything,
and
that's
what
makes
it
unfair.
with
respect
to
the
options
open
to
this
court,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeal
clearly
decided
this
case
on
the
bounds...
grounds
of
transient
jurisdiction
being
okay.
i
think
that
issue
is
directly
presented
here
by
virtue
of
the
petition
for
cert.
and
the
court
of
appeal
opinion.
in
shaffer
v.
heitner,
when
this
court
rejected
quasi
in
rem
jurisdiction
even
though
the
delaware
court
had
not
reviewed
the
matter
of
well,
but
are
there
minimum
contacts,
the
court
went
on
to
do
so,
concluded
not
and
reversed.
i
think
that's
what
the
court
should
do
here.
but
at
worst
for
husband,
the
court
should
abolish
the
doctrine
of
transient
jurisdiction
in
its
pure
form,
and
then,
if
it
adopts
the
restatement
analysis
or
if
it
replaces
it
with
minimum
contacts,
at
worse
for
husband,
simply
remand
that
part
of
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeal
to
consider
whether,
now
that
it
can't
base
it
simply
on
service
while
present
in
the
forum,
what
should
it
do?
i'm
quite
confident
that
under
california
law
it
will
reach
the
result
which
it
reached
in
this
case.
