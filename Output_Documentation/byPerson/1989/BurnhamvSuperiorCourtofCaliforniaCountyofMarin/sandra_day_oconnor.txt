justice
o'connor
mr.
sherman,
even
if
you
are
correct
that
some
minimum
contact
is
necessary
for
personal
jurisdiction,
wouldn't
the
transitory
presence
within
the
state
of
someone
meet
that
test--
justice
o'connor
--in
a
good
many
instances?
justice
o'connor
i
would
have
thought
so
and
that
perhaps
someone
who
voluntarily
enters
a
state
to
transact
some
business
or
to
visit
there
might
well
meet
whatever
minimum
contacts
are--
justice
o'connor
--required.
justice
o'connor
well--
justice
o'connor
--yes.
you
have
a
different
situation
is
someone
is
flying
over
the
state,
overhead--
justice
o'connor
--and
is
served
in
mid-air
than
you
do
with
someone
in
your
client's--
justice
o'connor
--position.
justice
o'connor
mr.
sherman,
what
do
you
think
of
the
amended
restatement
version
of
when
jurisdiction
applies?
justice
o'connor
that
there
is
jurisdiction?
justice
o'connor
it
starts
from
that
premise?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
struck
me
as
maybe
a
pretty
good
statement
of
what
the
rule
might
be.
that
unless...
that
jurisdiction
does
attach
unless
it's
just
too
attenuated.
and
the
notes
refer
to
special
circumstances
which
might
include
the
criminal
case
where
otherwise
there
will
be
no
opportunity
to
arrest
the
defendant.
justice
o'connor
well,
none
of
those
things
are
involved
here
either.
justice
o'connor
mr.
devereaux,
in
your
view,
however,
it
would
also
be
sufficient
if
the
petitioner
had
been
served
while
flying
across...
over
california
in
an
airplane.
justice
o'connor
how
about
someone
who
has
to
change
planes
in
an
airport
to
get
to
another
destination
and
is
served
while
changing
planes?
justice
o'connor
no.
we
know
that.
justice
o'connor
but
i
thought
your
power
theory
would
resolve
those
rather
unpleasant
questions.
justice
o'connor
and
that's
the
theory
you
espouse.
justice
o'connor
no?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
is
that
different
from
the
restatement
approach?
justice
o'connor
yeah,
but
i'm
sorry
to
hear--
--yeah,
but
then
you--
--you
say--
--just
a
minute.
okay.
then...
then
you
give
up
a
certain
element
of
certainty
in
the
due
process
standard
of
pennoyer
that
justice
scalia
referred
to
in
his
question
to
you...
to
your
opponent,
that
every...
in...
every
jurisdictional
inquiry
is
going
to
be
kind
of
an
ad
hoc
fact-specific
one,
isn't
it?
