89-44,
dennis
burnham
v.
the
superior
court
of
california.

we'll
resume
there
at

we'll
resume
the
argument
in
burnham
against
superior
court.
mr.
sherman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
there's...
there's
a
certain
builtin
pressure,
i
suppose,
from
the
bar
in
every
state
that
at
least
we
want
to
be
able
to
serve
as
many
people
as
can
be
served
in
another
state.
so,
i
would
think
that
the
chances
of
legislatures
substantially
restricting
the
jurisdiction
of
state
courts
on
their
own
are
probably
not
great.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sherman.
mr.
devereaux.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
devereaux.
mr.
sherman,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sherman.
the
case
is
submitted.
