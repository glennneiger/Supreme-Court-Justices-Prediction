mr.
james
o.
devereaux
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
opinions
issued
by
this
court
over
the
last
45
years,
starting
with
international
shoe,
there
has
been
a
clear
trend
toward
relaxing
limits
on
state
court
jurisdiction.
as
justice
white
observed
in
his
opinion
in
world-wide
volkswagen
v.
woodson,
this
relaxation
is
largely
attributable
to
the
fundamental
transformation
of
american
society
that
has
taken
place
and
which
has
been
accelerated
in
the
last
few
years.
it
is
ironic
that
in
this
case,
today
as
we
stand
on
the
threshold
of
the
21st
century
at
a
time
when
technological
progress
in
travel
and
communication
has
resulted
in
a
shrinking
of
our
planet
to
the
size
of
a
global
village,
and
at
a
time
when
the
citizens
of
this
country,
more
than
at
any
other
time
in
our
history,
are
more
likely
to
travel
across
state
borders
with
ease
and
with
increasing
frequency,
the
petitioner
is
arguing
for
a
retraction
of
the
permissible
reach
of
state
jurisdiction
and
a
categorical
rule
that
presence
within
the
boundaries
of
a...
of
the
forum
state
should
no
longer
provide
the
basis
for
the
exercise
of
state
jurisdiction
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
well,
i
don't
believe
that
this
case
is
limited
to
the
mere
fact
that
this
particular
defendant
was
served
within
the
state
of
california.
that
is
a
fact
in
this
case,
but
under
all
the
facts
in
this
case
in
a
period
of
less
than
two
and
a
half
years,
from
october
of
1987
until
today,
this
particular
defendant/husband
has
been
physically
present
in
california
more
than
20
times.
this
is
simply
not
a
case
of
transient
presence.
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
i
think--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--to
be
perfectly
honest,
i
do
think
that
that
would
be
a
reasonable
rule
because
under
this
case
the
fact
is--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
the...
my
understanding
of
the
particular
facts
in
this
case
are
that
this
husband
not
only
was
served
personally
in
mill
valley,
california
in
january
of
1988,
but
was
also
served
by
substituted
service,
not
personal
service,
in
new
jersey,
and
that
the
service
in
new
jersey
complied
with
new
jersey
requirements
relating
to
substitute
of
service.
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
that
is
correct.
i
do
think
it's
important
to
point
out,
however,
that
while
the
argument
was
presented
to
both
the
superior
court
and
the
court
of
appeal
in
california,
that
in
addition
to
actual
physical
service
in
california,
the
contacts
here,
the
connection
here,
is...
is
sufficient
disclosure--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--yes,
i
am.
and...
and
what
i
feel
i
should
point
out
is
that
the
california
courts
did
not
reject
that
argument.
they
simply
felt
they
didn't
need
to
address
it
because
they
were
able
to
resolve
the
case
on
the
basis
of
service.
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
it
was
raised
below
in
each
of
the
courts.
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
no.
that
really
is
not
my
position.
i...
i
personally
don't
believe
that
the
facts
of
grace
v.
macarthur
are
reasonable
and
in
that
case
did
not
lead
to
a
just
result.
so
that
i
am
not
arguing
in
favor
of...
of
those
facts.
i'm
not
really
addressing
a
whole--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--well,
those
facts
are
not
the
facts
in
this
case.
i
would
have--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--i
would
have
a
harder
time
justifying
jurisdiction
based
on
those
facts,
but
i
happily
don't
have
to
specifically
address
those
facts
in
this
case
because
here
we
have
not
only
the
husband's
repeated--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--i
believe
that
the
power
theory
would
resolve
those.
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
no.
the
theory--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--that
i
espouse
is
that
the
exercise
of
state
court
jurisdiction
in
each
case
must
be
fair
and
reasonable
under
the
standards
of
international
shoe
and
that
that
is
the
effect
in
this
case,
that
the
exercise--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--i
don't...
i
think
the
restatement...
the
revised
restatement
approach
sets
forth
an
eminently
reasonable
approach
to
resolving
this
problem.
and
i
think
that
what
this
case
really
does
not
call
for
is
a
sweeping
pronouncement
by
this
court
abolishing
the
presence
rule
of
jurisdiction
for
all
cases.
the
presence
rule,
as
the
restatement
has
reformulated
it,
is
eminently
reasonable
because
it
says
present...
presence
continues
to
be
a
proper
basis
for
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
as
long
as,
under
all
the
facts
and
circumstances,
it's
not
unreasonable
to--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--well,
i
think
that,
as
the
court
pointed
out
most
recently
in
1984
in
burger
king,
the
physical
presence
of
the
defendant
in
the
state
can
in
fact
enhance
the
affiliation
of
the
defendant
with
that
state
and
can
enhance
the
foreseeability
of
being
sued
in
that
state.
and
i
don't
see
anything
inherently
unfair
about
pinning
jurisdiction
on
the
fact
that
the
defendant
in
this
day
and
age
where
people
do
in
fact
travel
across
state
borders
regularly
is
found
within
the
state
and
therefore
is...
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
that
state.
this
court
has--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--well,
i
think
that...
i
think
that--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--this
person
didn't
just
happen
to
be
there
to
see
his
daughter,
however.
this
person
comes
to
california
regularly;
he
has
acknowledged
in
papers
that
he's
filed
in
the
california
courts
that
he
does
in
fact--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--no,
it
did
not.
it
didn't
reach
that
issue--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--because
it
felt--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--that
the
presence
rule
continued
to
be
the
law
in
this
country,
and
i
believe--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--no,
i'm
saying--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--no,
no,
no.
i'm
saying
that
it
is
and
that
it
ought
to
continue
to
be,
and
that
if
ever
this
court
or
any
other
court
is
presented
with
a
particular
factual
situation
where
it
leads
to
an
unfair
result,
that
is
the
time--
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
--well,
then
my
position
is
that
this
court
should
say
that
the
law
has
been
that
presence
is
sufficient
and
should
continue
to
say
that.
it
is
true
that
there
is
an
alternative
basis,
if
the
court
chooses
not
to
do
that,
to
uphold
this
decision.
and
that
is,
by
pointing
out
that
the
contacts
here...
the
connection
here
is
significant.
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
that
state
courts
always
have
the
right
to
decline
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction.
and
in
fact,
probably
the
most
relevant
case
where
that
occurred
was
kulko,
where
in
fact
the
california
courts
did
decline
to
exercise
jurisdiction
and
this
court
upheld
that
judgment
on
their
part.
in
this
case
and
in
kulko,
of
course
you
did
not
have
the
actual
presence
of
the
defendant,
and
that
is
a
major
distinguishing
factor
between
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
facts
of
that
case.
but
there
are
additional
important
differences
as
well
between
this
case
and
the
facts
in
kulko.
and
perhaps
the
most
important
of
those
are
the
fact
that
here
both
california
and
new
jersey
have
carefully
considered
the
propriety
of
those
respective
states
assuming
jurisdiction
in
this
matter
not
only
on
the
superior
court
level
but
on
every
level
of
the
state
judicial
system
in
both
states.
and
there
is
no
conflict
between
the
decisions
of
those
two
states.
they
both
came
to
consistent
conclusions
that
california
is
an
appropriate
state
to
assume
jurisdiction
in
this
case
under
the
circumstances.
in
addition
to
that,
and
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
husband
was
not
physically
present
within
california
in
kulko,
here
you
have
more
substantial
contacts,
more
substantial
connection
between
the
defendant/husband
and
the
state.
and
on
that
basis,
i
think
that
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
is
eminently
reasonable.
in
addition
to
all
of
those
factors,
here
you
have
california
being
the
state
of
domicile
of
the
wife
and
the
children.
i
think
that
the
decisions
issued
by
this
court
in
recent
years,
starting
with
kulko
and
continuing
with
world-wide
volkswagen
and
burger
king
and
keeton
and
asahi
metal
industries,
may
reveal
a
shift
in
the
analytical
approach
that
the
court
is
taking
toward
the
question
of
fairness
and
substantial
justice,
a
shift
in
favor
of
evaluating
the
various
interests
and
the
other
factors
that
are
involved
in
the
case.
and
particularly
in
a
family
law
case,
the
fact
of
domicile
of
one
of
the
spouses
and
the
children,
the
interests
of
the
state
of
domicile
in
the
litigation
in
the
subject
matter
of
the
case
is
an
extremely
important
factor
to
be
taken
into
consideration.
mr.
james
o.
devereaux
well,
justice
scalia,
i,
of
course,
can't
speak
to
the
reasons
for
the
court's
granting
cert.
in
this
case.
that
is
an
important
issue
and
i
am
not
trying
to
persuade
the
court
to
avoid
deciding
that
issue.
i
believe
that
the
court
should
uphold
the
decision
on
that
basis.
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
this
case
also
provides
an
opportunity,
should
the
court
desire
to
take
the
opportunity,
to
decide
the
case
on
alternative
grounds
as
well,
one
of
which
is
the
question
of
sufficient
connection
or
contacts,
another
of
which
is
an
evaluation
of
california's
interest
as
a
state
of
domicile
and
the
interests
of
the
wife
and
children
in
this
case.
the
court,
of
course,
has
no
obligation
to
decide
those
issues
and
can
limit
its
decision
to
the
issue
of
the
continued
viability
of
the
presence
basis.
but
the...
the
case
does
involve...
commend
itself
to
these
additional
alternative
grounds,
should
the
court
desire
to
address
them
because
they
were
raised
below
in
the
state
courts
and
have
been
preserved.
they
are
in
the
record,
and
depending
upon
the
approach
that
the
court
would
like
to
take,
those
issues
are
available
for
a
decision.
but
if
the
court
desires
to
limit
its
decision
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
presence
of
the
defendant
within
the
state
and
service
of
process
upon
him
while
he
was
present
continues
to
be
a
sufficient
jurisdictional
basis,
then
my
position
is
that
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
it
has
not
only
been...
that
principle
has
not
only
been
established
in
pennoyer
v.
neff,
but
it
has
in
fact
been
acknowledge
by
this
court
in
more
modern
decisions,
including
international
shoe,
where
the
court
expressly
acknowledged
that
the
minimum
contacts
analysis
related
to
service
outside
the
state
where
the
defendant
was
not
present
but
at
least
by
implication
recognized
that
if
a
defendant
is
present
within
the
state,
that
is
a
valid
jurisdictional
basis.
the
o'neill
v.
new
york
case
was
also
an
application
of
the
presence
rule
where
the
court
clearly
said,
the
defendant
being
present
in
florida,
florida
had
jurisdiction
over
him.
so
that
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
based
on
the
precedent
established
by
this
court
in
more
than
one
case
over
the
last
100-plus
years,
an
upholding
of
the
judgment
of
the
california
courts
can
be
accomplished
simply
by
recognizing
that
the
rule
continues
to
be
in
effect.
and
i
think
it's
particularly
significant
that
when
the
commentators
argued
that
shaffer
v.
heitner
required
at
least
a
reevaluation
of
the
presence
rule,
if
not
an
outright
abolishing
of
it,
the
american
law
institute
did
reexamine
that
rule
and
concluded
that
it
was
not
appropriate
to
abolish
the
rule
but
instead
retained
the
rule
in
a
slightly
modified
version.
and
i
think
this
is
an
indication
that
the
presence
rule
is
valid,
it's
not
unfair
and
unreasonable
and
it
does
lend
certainty
and
predictability
to
the
jurisdictional
equation.
so,
to
the
extent
that
this
court
wants
to
limit
its
decision
to
that
narrow
issue,
i
would
urge
the
court
to
uphold
the
judgment
of
the
california
courts.
thank
you
very
much.
