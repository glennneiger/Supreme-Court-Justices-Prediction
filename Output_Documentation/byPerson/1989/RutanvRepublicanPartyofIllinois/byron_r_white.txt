r.
white
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
face
right
up
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
they
decide
that
even
if
it
was
it's
perfectly
okay
with...
didn't
they
say
that
this
preference
is
only...
is
limited
to
certain
categories?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
it
say
it

r.
white
and
you
can't,
and
you
couldn't
get
a
job
without...
with
being
cleared
politically.
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
others?
justice

sponsorship?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
the
allegation.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no,
but
they
are
alleging
a
partisan
test
with
respect
to
these
particular
people.
and
these
are
the
people
who
are
before
the
court.
they
didn't
have
the
sponsorship.
justice
byron
r.
white
although
some
other
people
may
not
have
been
discriminated
against,
these
people
were,
weren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean...
maybe
that's
the
wrong
word,
but
the...
but
nevertheless
they
weren't
hired
because
they
didn't
have
republican
connections.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
it...
that's
the
way
it
is
alleged.
that's
what
is
alleged.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
was
alleged
here
that
is
exactly
what--
justice
byron
r.
white
--whether
it's
a
hiring
or
a
promotion
or
what.

xxx
make
much
difference;
they
both
are
qualified,
as
long
as
the
choice
is
made
to
pick
the
well-qualified
republican.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
it
wouldn't...
your
case
would
be
just
as
good
on...
your
constitutional
argument
if
they
were
equally
qualified.
