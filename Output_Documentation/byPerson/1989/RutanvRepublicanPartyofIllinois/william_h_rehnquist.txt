we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
88-1872,
cynthia
rutan
v.
republican
party
of
illinois,
and
a
companion
case.
ms.
leahy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
there
any
new
hires
or
potential
new
hires
who
are
parties
to
this
action,
people
who
are
not
already
in
state
employment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
had
never
been
employed
by
the
state
before?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
contention
is
that
we
should
expand
our
rulings
in
branti
and
elrod,
to
extend
them
to
the
hiring
process?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
the
hiring.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
branti
and
elrod,
the
opinions
point
out
in
both
cases
that
those
people
were
already
within
the
government
employment
system,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
two-party
system
suggests
the
outs
will
get
their
turn
and
they
will
do
the
same
thing
to
the...
for
their
supporters,
that
the
ins
did
this
time.
i
mean,
there
is
a
cycle
involved.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
in
buckley
the
facts
were
that
anyone
who
contributed
was
required
to
have
a
fairly
detailed
summary
and
so
forth.
here,
the
person,
the
inquiry
is
made
only
when
the
person
seeks
a
job.
it
isn't
the
government
inquiring
on
their
own
as
to
what
they
have
done.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
something
in
the
record
that
indicates
the
party
did
look
into
that
sort
of
a
thing,
whether
you
were
opposed
to
one
faction
of
the
party?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
leahy.
mr.
sullivan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
with
respect
to
the
individuals
involved
here,
aren't
the
allegations
that
each
of
them
failed
to
either
get
a
promotion
or
a
transfer
or
a
rehire,
and
it
was
because
they
could
not
produce
any
evidence
of
whatever
you
call
it,
loyalty
to
the
republican
party.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
someone
applies
for
a
transfer
and
they
are
denied
the
transfer,
you
really
wouldn't
expect
further
retaliation,
would
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
a
part
of
the
reason
too,
mr.
sullivan,
you
want
to
be
able
to
have
each
party
get
people
to
serve
as
poll
watchers
and
election
judges
and
challengers,
the
very
gritty
kind
of
work
at
various
elections.
and
the
way
you
get
them
to
do
that
is
promise
them...
you
can't
promise
them
they
are
going
to
be
secretary
of
state
or
attorney
general.
you
promise
them
they'll
be
a
bailiff's
assistant
or
something
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sullivan.
ms.
leahy,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
leahy.
the
case
is
submitted.
