mrs.
leahy,
some,
in
fact
quite
a
few
political
scientists,
think
that
political
parties
are
important,
too,
for
the
democratic
process,
and
think
that
the
ability
of
people
to
get
jobs,
the
spoils
system
if
you
want
to
put
it
that
way,
is
important
to
maintaining
the
viability
of
at
least
the
kind
of
political
party
system
we
have
had,
a
two-party
system
instead
of
multiple
splinter
parties.
why
isn't
that
a
sufficient
state
interest,
perhaps
not
to
overcome
firing
somebody
who
is
already
in
a
job
and
putting
that
person
on
the
street,
but
a
sufficient...
sufficient
interest
to
say
we
will
hire
the
people
who
supported
us
for
office?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
don't
want
to
reward
all
those
who
are
politically
active.
they
want
to
reward
those
people
who
have
worked
for
that
party.
i
mean,
it's
not
new.
that
has
been
done
right
in
this
country
for
many,
many
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
think
andrew
jackson
maybe
did
it
to
a
far
greater
extent.
i...
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
we...
we've
done
it
in
another
context,
though.
in
affirmative
action
cases
we
have
indicated
that
there
is
a
difference
between
race-based
determinations
for
purposes
of
hiring
and
race-based
determinations
for
purposes
of
firing.
haven't
we
said
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
we
would
make
a
distinction
under
title
vii
if
an
employer
had
an
affirmative
action
program
for
one
purpose
versus
for
another
purpose?
that
wouldn't
involve
remedy.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
we
would
treat
an
employer
who
did...
who
fired
people
on
the
basis
of
racial
preferences
the
same
as
we
treat
an
employer
who
hired
people
on
that
basis?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
don't
really
inquire
into
your...
your
philosophical
views.
i
mean,
you...
they
just
want
to
know
whether
you
are
republican.
they
don't
care
what
you
think
about
any
national
or
international
issue,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
which
is...
which
is
another
thing
that
this
kind
of
a
system
does.
it
blurs
the,
what
would
otherwise
be
a
very
sharp
distinction
between
the
two
parties.
people
will
tend
to
go
into
one
or
the
other
in
order
to
get
a
job.
and
the
parties
become
less...
less
philosophical.
which,
again,
some
political
scientists
think
is
a
good
thing,
so
that
you
don't
have
a
pendulum
swing
from
one
extreme
to
another
whenever...
whenever
the
party
in
power
changes.
why
isn't
that
also
a
good
state
interest
that
would
justify--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i...
many
think
the
genius
of
the
two-party
system
is
that
it
reduces
extremes,
it
reduces
robust
debates,
so
that
you
don't
go
from
capitalism
to
socialism
overnight.
it
doesn't
make
that
much
difference
if
you
put
in
another
party,
because
a
lot
of
the
people
in
the
party
are
just
there
for
the
jobs
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
clear
that
there
are
no
philosophical
or
political
views
that
are
inquired
into,
simply
party
affiliation.
if
you
voted
as
a
republican
it
doesn't
matter
if
you,
you
have
a
picture
of
franklin
roosevelt
on
your
wall
and
believe
in
everything
he
stood
for.
right?
it
is
just
whether
you
voted
as
a
republican.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
but
that's...
that's
a
different
point.
that's
a
different
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
the
point
that
this
is
not
a
partisan,
i
mean,
even
taking
into
account
the
friendship,
it
seems
to
me
it's
still
a
very
partisan
thing.
it
doesn't
help
you
to
be
a
friend
of
a
democrat,
does
it?
i
mean,
it
isn't
friendship,
it's
friendship
with
a
republican.
i
still
consider
that
partisan.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
is
the
big
republican.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
do
run
a
lawsuit
now
under
elrod
when
they
make
a
hiring
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry,
a
firing
decision.
but
you
say
that's...
that's
not
likely
to
be
as
numerous
as
promotions,
transfers,
hiring.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
ought
to
tighten
it
up
a
little;
it's
too
loose.
it's
not
doing
the
job
you
want
it
to
do.
