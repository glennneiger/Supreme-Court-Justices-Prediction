mrs.
leahy,
illinois
has
a
civil
service
system?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
was...
there
was
an
executive
order--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
imposed
a
hiring
freeze
back
in
1980?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
that
freeze
still
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
did
the
freeze
in
effect
impose
a
new
system
of
determining
promotions
and
transfers
and
hires?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
the
freeze,
the
text
of
the
freeze
just
said
we
won't
have
any
more
hiring.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
had
the
civil
service
system
been
in
effect,
there
would
not...
you
wouldn't
be
here.
it
would
operate
to
disregard
these
considerations
that
you
say
are
used
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
know
how
many
states
do
not
have
a
civil
service
system
now
for
nonpolicy-making
employees?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mrs.
leahy,
would
you
tell
me
whether
all
the
plaintiffs
who
were
before
the
district
court
are
still
on
the
case
and
before
us
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
every
category--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
represented
before
us
now.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
promotion,
rehire,--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--recall
from
layoff.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
transfer,
and
new
hire.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then
they
are
not
before
us.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mrs.
leahy,
you
concede
that
if
the
position
were
a
policy-making
one
that
patronage
considerations
could
survive
the
first
amendment
challenge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
sullivan,
were
all
of
the
named
plaintiffs
here
processed
through
that
civil
service
system
and
tested
and
examined
and
rated
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they
were
included
in
the
list
of
eligibles
for
promotion,
transfer,
et
cetera?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we're
here
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
am
just
trying
to
find
out
whether
they
all
were
tested
and
processed
through
the
civil
service
system.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
think
that
interest
can
be
served
by
the
partisan
appointment
that
goes
on
for
policy-making
employees?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
you
have
to
acknowledge
that
is
some
kind
of
a
burden
on
the
right
of
political
association
of
the
employee,
that
system
you
describe.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
does
that
in
some
fashion.
