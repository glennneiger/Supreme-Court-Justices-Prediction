justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
to
be
clear,
the
civil
service
system
just
had
the
governor's
order
superimposed
upon
it.
it
was
not
suspended?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
for
the
plaintiffs
here,
the
civil
service
system
was
still
operating
in
that
it
had
examinations
and
it
had
a
list
of
qualified
people?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
we
were
to
disagree
with
you
on
that
point.
suppose
that
we
were
to
conclude
that
this
does
support
the
two-party
system.
would
you
then
have
no
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
would
concede
that
that
is
a
compelling
interest
protecting
the
two-party
system?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
then
on
the
first
prong
of
the
analysis
it
is
just
a
question
of
whether
or
not
we
agree
with
your
characterization
that
it
helps
out
one
party
only.
because
if
we...
if
we
disagree
with
that
and
say
it
helps
both
parties,
or
helps
preserve
the
two-party
system,
then
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest.
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
want
us
then
to
decide
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
illinois
system
does
coerce
political
activities
and
political
beliefs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
thought
that...
that
the
opposite
was
your
point.
you
are
justifying
it
by
saying
that
it
encourages
party
activity
in
those
that
are
partisanship--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
how...
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
it
either
coerces
party
membership
and
party
activity
or
it
doesn't.
which
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
am
not
talking
about
who
is
benefit
and
who
is
hurt.
i
am
asking
about
the
proposition
whether
or
not
this
is
coercive
of
a
person's
political
beliefs
and
political
expression
and
political
participation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
i
don't
see
how
it
serves
the
interest
that
you
have
been
claiming
in
the
first
half
of
the
argument
that
it
does,
that
it
promotes
party...
that
it
promotes
the
party--
--you
ought
to
tighten
it
up
a
little.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
so
then
you
want
us
to
decide
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
this
is
coercive
of
political
beliefs
and
political
expression.
