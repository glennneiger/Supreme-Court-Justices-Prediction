ms.
mary
lee
leahy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
complaint
in
this
case
alleges
that
the
governor's
office
of
personnel
controls
the
filling
of
all
employment
positions
in
departments
and
agencies
under
the
jurisdiction
of
the
governor...
that
is,
promotions,
transfers,
recalls
from
layoff
and
actual
hire.
political
affiliation
is
the
decisive
factor
in
filling
these
positions.
in
making
its
decision,
the
governor's
office
uses
the
county
republican
parties.
the
applicant...
and
by
applicant
i
am
including
not
just
someone
applying
for
hire,
but
applicant
for
promotion,
transfer,
recall
from
layoff...
the
applicant
voting
record
in
the
primary
is
reviewed,
as
are
contributions
to
the
party
and
actual
support
of
the
party.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
19--
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
your
honor,
i
believe
that
this...
yes,
a
new
system
imposed
on
the
civil
service
system.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
unless
i
approve
it,
or
someone
that
i
delegate
that
authority
to
approves
it.
that
was
the
gist
of
the
governor's
executive
order.
and
that
is
exactly
what
has
happened.
their
power
to
approve
the
filling
of
any
of
these
positions
has
been
delegated
to
the
governor's
office
of
personnel,
and
they
decide
the
filling
of
these
positions.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
your
honor,
we
believe,
and
we
quoted
in
our
brief,
certain
appellate
court
rulings
in
illinois
that
talked
about
the
purpose
of
the
civil
service
system.
we
believe
that
had
that
been
operating
as
we
believe
it
ought
to,
no,
we
would
not
be
here,
because
these
constitutional
issues
would
not
have
been
raised.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
the
precise
number.
the
overwhelming
majority
do,
your
honor.
we
have
looked
at
certain
states.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
decision
now
is
made
by
the
governor's
office
of
personnel.
and
as
we
point
out,
unless
the
form,
which
is
found
at
page
7
of
our
brief,
unless
that
sponsorship
of
the
individual
person
makes
its
way
to
the
governor's
office
of
personnel,
they
do
not
even
get
in
that
pool
to
be
considered.
as
we
have
alleged,
both
ms.
rutan
and
mr.
taylor
should
have
received
the
promotion
had
the
civil
service
system
been
working,
because
they
were
more
qualified
than
the
people
who
did
receive
those
promotions.
but
without
that
sponsorship
they
do
not
get
in
the
pool
to
be
considered.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
that
is
the
same
thing,
your
honor.
representative
winchester
wrote
to
petitioner
moore,
who
was
trying
to
get
a
job
in
the
department
of
corrections,
and
he
said
you
have
to
get
the
endorsement
of
the
county
party
before
your
name
can
be
referred
to
the
governor's
office.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
yes,
your
honor,
petitioner
moore.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
he
was
seeking
positions
within
the
department
of
corrections.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
i
would
use
the
word
extend,
but
i
am
asking
the
court
to
apply
those
same
principles
of
law,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
your
honor,
i
believe
that
this
court
has
not
made
any
distinction
in
applicants'
first
amendment
rights
in
other
contexts.
for
example,
torcaso
v.
watkins.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
but
i
think
the
only
thing
that
the
court
could
decide
were
the
facts
that
were
before
the
court
at
that
time,
and
those
were
discharges.
your
honor,
that
is
precisely
the
question
that
is
before
this
court,
as
to
whether
those
factors
that
were
constitutionally
impermissible
in
branti
and
elrod
are
constitutionally
impermissible
in
the
benefits
of
employment
we
are
talking
about
here.
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
those
claiming
recall
from
layoff,
that
they
were
not
recalled
from
layoff
when
they
should
have
been
due
to
their
political
affiliation,
should
be
remanded
under
elrod
and
branti.
the
court
then
held
that
as
to
petitioners
rutan
and
taylor,
their
denial
of
promotion
and
denial
of
transfer
should
be
remanded
to
see
if
it
reached
the
level
of
constructive
discharge.
and
then
the
court
outright
held
there
was
no
cause
of
action
whatsoever
for
the
man
seeking
the
job.
we
have
approached
this
case
in
the
traditional
first
amendment
analysis,
and
the
respondents
have
failed
to
do
that.
before
going
into
that
analysis,
i
would
like
to
point
out
a
few
things
that
i
think
are
important.
the
first
is
that
there
is
no
dispute
that
a
person
has
the
right
not
to
affiliate
with
a
particular
party
and
has
the
right
not
to
support
a
particular
candidate
or
to
support
particular
beliefs
under
the
first
amendment,
that
that
is
protected
activity.
there
also
has
been
no
suggestion
at
any
point
along
the
way
that
the
jobs
in
question
in
this
case
fall
under
branti,
that
is,
the
confidential
policy
making
exception
which
was
first
talked
about
in
elrod
and
then
further
delineated
in
branti.
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
admitted
that
what
had
happened
to
the
petitioners
and
cross-respondents
was
coercive.
the
respondents
have
used
the
words
intrusive.
and
yet,
throughout
this
litigation
from
the
very
beginning
the
respondents
have
offered
no
compelling
reason
as
to
why
such
coercion,
or
such
intrusion,
should
be
allowed
to
exist.
if
we
go
back
to
the
traditional
first
amendment
analysis,
we
start
with
the
conduct
in
question.
the
conduct
in
question
in
this
case
is
the
right
not
to
affiliate
or
not
to
associate
or
not
to
support
particular
political
ideas.
and
that
is
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
the
very
coercion
that
this
court
found
existed
in
elrod
exists
in
this
case.
the
purpose
of
this
system
is
to
force
the
person
to
affiliate
with
the
party
by
voting
in
the
primary,
or
to
contribute
money
or
to
do
volunteer
work
if
they
wish
to
get
the
promotion
or
the
transfer
or
the
job
itself.
the
sponsorship
that
was
found
to
be
offensive
in
branti
is
present
in
this
case.
the
form
used
in
sangamon
county
requires
the
recommendation
or
endorsement
of
the
precinct
committeemen.
these
actions
are
substantial.
jobs
are
important
to
people
promotions
are
important
to
people.
being
able
to
get
a
job
in
your
chosen
field
is
important.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
your
honor,
i
am
beginning
with
your
premise
that
it
is
important
to
have
a
stable
two-party
system.
i
believe
that
this
system
is
designed
not
to
support
the
two-party
system,
but
to
preserve
and
protect
the
one
party.
if...
if
there
were
a
state
interest
in
rewarding
those
who
were
politically
active,
then
these
jobs
ought
to
be
open
equally
to
all
of
those
who
are
politically
active.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
to
a
far
less
extent,
your
honor,
but
that
is
not--
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
--your
honor,
that
is
why
i
said
i
accepted
the
premise
that
it
is
the
two-party
system.
this
system
is
not
designed
to
promote
that.
it
is
designed
to
preserve
and
increase
the
strength
of
the
incumbent
party.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
well,
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
that
there
is
a
cycle
involved,
or
how
short
that
cycle
has
to
be.
i
do
not
think
that
the
first
amendment
gives
the
majority
the
right
to
trample
on
the
rights
of
the
minority
just
because
they
happen
to
be
in
power
for
a
particular
period
of
time.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
no,
your
honor,
if
you
find
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest,
and
that
it
is
served
by...
that
it
is
this
preservation
or
promotion
of
the
two-party
system,
then
you
have
to
move
to
the
third
prong
of
the
first
amendment
analysis,
which
is--
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
--yes,
your
honor,
i
think
protecting
the
stable
two-party
system
is.
i
would
point
out--
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
i
misunderstood
your
question.
i
think
then
you
would
have
to
look
at
whether
or
not
in
those
states
which
have
civil
service
protection
and
do
not
take
political
factors
into
consideration
in
hiring,
you
would
have
to
look
there
to
see
if
there
has
been
any
effect
on
the
two-party
system.
i
don't
believe
that
the
federal
system,
or
those
states
that
have
a
true
civil
service
system
in
hiring,
that
the
two-party
system
has
been
damaged
in
any
way.
i
would
submit
that
this
system...
the
flip
side
of
the
coin
can
be
that
this
system
so
turns
people
off
from
participation
in
political
activity
that
it
damages
that
system.
take
a
person
who
comes
out
of
college
with
a
degree
in
sociology
and
wants
to
be
a
case
worker
in
the
department
of
children
and
family
services,
and
then
finds
out
that
this
is
the
system
by
which
he
will
get
that
job.
i
think
that
could
damage
political
participation
as
much
or
more
than
any
type
of
promotion
of
the
system
that
has
gotten
by
hiring
those
who
are
politically
favored.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
yes
they
are,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
that
is
right,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
recall
from
layoff,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
transfer.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
did
not
seek
cert.
on
the
recall
from
layoff,
mr.
o'brien
and
mr.
standefer.
but--
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
--the
cross-petition
was
granted
in
regard
to
them,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
one
point
about,
about
the
hiring
and
the
significance
of
that.
i
do
not
believe
that
this
court
has
ever
made
any
distinction
between
the
applicant
and
those
who
are
incumbent.
the
torcaso
case,
keyishian,
perry,
can
certainly
be
viewed
as
an
applicant
because
this
court
held
even
if
he
had
no
right,
no
expectation
of
continuing
employment,
that
if
he
were
not
given
a
year's
teaching
contract
because
of
exercise
of
his
first
amendment
rights,
he
had
stated
a
cause
of
action.
this
court
recently
addressed
the
applicant
for
unemployment
compensation
benefits
in
frazee
and
in
hobbie,
and
again
found
no
distinction
between...
no
distinction
in
regard
to
first
amendment
rights.
we
believe
that--
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
--yes,
your
honor,
if
you
are
referring
to
wygant
and
its
prodigy.
but
i
would
point
out
there,
your
honor,
as
we
did
in
our
reply
brief,
that
that
comparison
was
only
done
at
the
third
stage
of
that
first
amendment
and
our
fourteenth
amendment
analysis.
and
that
was
when
you
were
looking
at
the
remedy
to
be
imposed.
i
think
there
was
an
uncomfortable
choice
before
this
court.
somebody
was
going
to
have
to
be
hurt,
and
the
court
admitted
that
both
were
intrusive,
firing
and
the
hiring,
but
the
court
found
one
to
be
less
intrusive.
but
that
was
at
the
remedy
stage,
your
honor.
that
is
not
where
we
are
in
this
case.
we
are
not...
there
is
not
an
uncomfortable
choice
before
this
court
as
to
which
category
of
persons
to
hurt.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
i
think
it
then
would
depend
on
the
purpose
of
the
affirmative
action
program,
because
the
affirmative
action
program
is
to
remedy
a
prior
wrong.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
yes,
your
honor,
if
we
are
not
to
the
remedy
stage
of
the
matter.
we
contend
that
the
state
has
the
obligation
to
be
neutral
when
granting
the
type
of
benefits
that
are
at
stake
in
this
case.
one
last
thing
about
the
hiring.
so
many
areas
of
public
employment...
public
employment
has
become
such
a
large
employer.
so
many
of
those
areas
are
strictly
public
employment.
law
enforcement,
conservation,
corrections,
regulation
of
certain
industries.
the
seventh
circuit
has
effectively
cut
off
hundreds
of
people
from
seeking
to
work
in
those
chosen
professions.
the
important
factor
is
that
no
reason
has
been
given
for
taking
into
account
or
consideration
the
person's
political
affiliation
when
denying
them
these
benefits.
what
is
the
reason
that
the
state
should
even
inquire
into
the
political
affiliation
of
the
person
who
seeks
to
be
a
prison
guard,
or
the
person
who
wants
to
be
recalled
to
his
position
as
dietary
manager,
or
the
person
who
seeks
a
promotion
as
a
lead
worker
on
an
equipment
crew
on
the
state
highway?
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor,
under
branti.
that
has
never
been
in
dispute
in
this
case.
these
positions
simply
do
not
fall
under
that
category.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
one
thing
about
the
political
participation.
in
buckley
v.
valeo
this
court
said
that
sweeping
inquiries
into
protected
areas
discouraged
the
citizens
from
exercising
the
rights
protected
by
the
constitution.
as
the
court
knows
that
case
dealt
with
regulation
of
election
expenditures,
ethics
and
so
on.
we
think
that
is
true
in
this
case,
that
the
detailed
inquiry
made
into
these
peoples'
lives
about
their
political
affiliation,
will
discourage
their
participation
from
that.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
they
inquire
into
how
you
voted
in
the
primary,
every
two
years
from
1978
on,
and
even
under
certain
circumstances,
if
you
weren't
old
enough
to
vote
in
those
primaries,
how
your
parents
voted
in
the
primaries.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
if
you
define
being
a
republican
by
having
voted
in
the
primary
and
given
money
and
worked
for
the
party,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
open
and
robust
debate
on
the
issues
is
discouraged
by
this
system,
and
that
that
is
what
is
healthy
for
the
two-party
system.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
but,
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
if
you
go
to
the
federal
government
and
you
go
to
those
states
that
enforce
a
true
civil
service
system
without
considering
these
factors,
the
party
has
not
been
any
different
in
that
regard.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
no,
your
honor.
let's
take
the
contributions
for
a
moment.
the
contributions
to
the
party
or
its
candidate
are
traced,
and
therefore
the
support
of
a
particular
idea...
say
there
is
a
faction
in
the
party
in
illinois
that
is
on
outs
with
the
incumbent
faction
of
that
party.
that
would
lead
to
a
review
of
the
philosophical
beliefs
of
the
individual
person
seeking
the
state
benefit.
the
fact
he
contributed
to
one
candidate
in
the
republican
primary
over
the
other.
so
i
think
it
goes
beyond
that,
your
honor,
when
you
are
looking
at
work
and
at
contributions,
because
those,
as
we
have
alleged,
could
be
for
candidates
as
opposed
to
the
party
itself.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
your
honor,
the
complaint
alleges
that
the
contributions,
the
financial
support
to
candidates
or
to
the
party
is
taken
into
consideration.
as
to
whether...
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
a
particular
person,
there
was
a
primary
battle
that
contributions
were
made
to
one
and
not
to
the
other.
no,
your
honor,
we
are
here
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
may
it
please
the
court:
i
believe
the
complaint,
read
fairly
to
the
petitioners
and
cross-respondents,
clearly
makes
the
point
that
what
happened
to
these
people
happened
because
they
did
not
support
the
incumbent
party.
we
have
clearly
met
the
standard
that
would
be
required
under
mt.
healthy
that
political
consideration
be
a
substantial
or
motivating
factor.
i
would
like
to
make
just
a
couple
of
comments
about
the
state
civil
service
system.
in
terms
of
the
test
being
administered
and
the
grades
being
given,
yes,
that
is
in
place.
but
as
we
pled
in
our
complaint,
it
is
not
the
department
or
agency
that
is
making
the
decision
about
filling
these
position.
it
is
the
governor's
office
of
personnel.
and
they
superimpose,
then,
on
those
who
meet
the
minimal
qualifications
the
requirement
of
sponsorship.
ms.

lee

no,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
specifically
pled,
that
petitioners
rutan
and
taylor
were
more
qualified
than
who
was
chosen.
ms.
mary
lee
leahy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that's
the
decisive
factor.
just
a
couple
of
comments
about
an
increase
in
litigation.
we
submit
that
under
the
rule
of
law
that
we
seek
there
would
be
less
likelihood
of
that,
because
what
we
are
asking
for
is
a
clear
rule,
thou
shalt
not,
except
in
policy-making
positions.
that
is
a
rule
that
can
be
clearly
understood
by
the
employer.
if
there
is
not
political
hiring
and
if
the
office
is
administered
in
an
even-handed
manner,
there
isn't
going
to
be
litigation.
we
have
looked
at
the
circuits,
the
second,
the
third,
the
eleventh
and
the
d.c.
circuits
that
have
adopted
this
kind
of
rule
of
law,
and
there
has
not
been
that
increase
in
litigation.
we
submit
that
the
possibilities
are
far
more
in
the
area
of
race
or
sex
discrimination,
and
yet
no
one
would
suggest
to
this
court,
at
least
i
hope
not,
that,
if
a
person
is
denied
a
job
because
of
their
sex
or
because
of
their
race,
that
they
have
not
stated
a
cause
of
action.
the
possibility
is
far
more
in
terms
of
litigation
in
those
two
areas
than
it
is
in
this
area.
we
submit
that
the
state
of
law
as
it
is
under
the
seventh
circuit
requires
far
more
litigation.
the
seventh
circuit
has
held
that
you
do
have
a
cause
of
action
if
you
are
harassed
for
your
political
affiliation,
but
you
only
have
a
cause
of
action
for
failure
to
promote
if
it
reaches
the
level
of
constructive
discharge.
but
in
the
harassment
claim
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
level
of
constructive
discharge.
that
is
asking
the
courts
to
litigate
not
only
the
protected
right,
but
then
does
it
reach
the
level
of
constructive
discharge.
it
does
not
give
sound
guidance
to
the
employer
who
has
to
make
the
decision.
we
are
asking
this
court
to
hold
that
political
affiliation,
which
was
considered
constitutionally
impermissible
in
discharge,
that
those
factors
are
constitutionally
impermissible
in
denial
of
these
very
important
public
benefits.
the
court
has
repeatedly...
it
was
explained
in
perry,
in
elrod,
in
branti.
the
principles
were
reaffirmed
in
connick,
they
were
reaffirmed
in
mcpherson
v.
rankin.
those
principles
of
law
are
good,
and
they
should
apply
in
this
case.
the
state
may
not
deny
a
benefit,
these
benefits,
for
constitutionally
impermissible
reasons.
thank
you.
