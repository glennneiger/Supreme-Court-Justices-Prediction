mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
by
reframing
the
issue
as
stated
by
mrs.
leahy,
and
as
contained
in
the
complaint
which
judge
baker
dismissed
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
en
banc
affirmed.
the
alleged
system
is
not
a
strictly
partisan
political
system.
the
system
in
illinois
that
is
alleged
in
this
complaint
is
consistent
with
the
illinois
personnel
code,
which
justice
o'connor
asked
about.
that
code
was
and
still
is
in
operation.
under
that
personnel
code,
any
applicant
for
a
job,
promotion,
transfer
or...
not
rehire,
but
job,
promotion
or
transfer
must
be
tested
and
evaluated,
evaluated
by
superiors
in
case
of
promotions,
tested
by
the
applicable
agency
in
case
of
a
new
hire.
with
respect
to
new
hires,
the
personnel
code
requires
that
the
persons
who
take
the
test
are
listed
in
a
group
from
the
highest-ranking
group,
or
they
can...
you
can
take
the
three
highest
on
the
list
of...
passed
the
test.
and
promotions
must
be
made
from
a
list
of
qualified
employees.
all
of
the
people
who
were
hired
or
promoted
under
the
system
alleged
in
the
complaint
qualified
under
the
illinois
personnel
code,
and
it
is
not
alleged
to
the
contrary.
but
the
code
allows
play.
there
is
play
in
the
code
within
those
qualified
people.
and
what
it
allows
is
that
the
persons
who
are
at
the
heads
of
the
department
or
the
hiring
authority
may
select
among
those
qualified,
persons
who
are
recommended,
persons
who
are
political
supporters,
or
persons
who
are
friends
of
those
who
recommend
and
are
political
supporters,
so
that
we
start
out
with
the
underlying
proposition
that
the
illinois
personnel
code
is
not
in
anyway
defeated
or
diminished
by
this
system
and
that
no
one
who
is
not
qualified
for
a
job
or
a
promotion
has
been
hired
or
promoted.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
yes,
they
were.
all
but
moore
were
already
employed.
and
in
fact...
but
the
answer
is
yes,
and
moore
was
tested.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
yes.
and
indeed,
justice
o'connor,
two
of
the
plaintiffs,
o'brien
and
standefer,
who
are
here
complaining
about
the
system,
got
jobs
under
the
system.
standefer
was
hired,
i
think
it
was
1984,
after
this
system
was
in
place,
and
claims
that
he
voted
only
in
the
democratic
primary.
and
o'brien,
after
a
layoff
which
had
nothing
to
do
with
politics,
a
layoff
he
does
not
complain
about,
was
rehired,
he
says
after
he
obtained
the
support
of
the
republican
county
chairman,
but
he
does
not
say
he
changed
his
political
affiliation.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
yes.
but,
i'm
telling
you
what
you--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--the
answer
is
yes.
so
that
this
complaint
alleges,
and
i
think
if
your
honors
were
to
look
at
paragraph...
i
think
it's
11(f)
of
the
complaint,
at,
which
is
in
the
brief
in
opposition
record
appendix
7,
they
allege
that
in
making
hiring
decisions,
and
this
is
within--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--all
right.
it's
in
the
orange
brief
in
opposition,
and
it
is
in
the
appendix
ra-7.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
it
looks
orange
to
me.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
okay.
it's
11(f).
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
11(f).
and
here
is
the
allegation.
and
that
this...
also,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
at
the
beginning
it
says
that
the
hiring
decisions
are
substantially
motivated
by
political
considerations.
it
is
not
a
strict
test;
it
is
what
consideration
is
given
to
this
favored
class,
the
ones--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--we
would
defend
such
a
system.
it
is
not
the
systems
here.
governor
thompson
i
think
would
not
subscribe
to
such
a
system.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
your
honor,
this
system...
i
want
to
make
it
clear,
justice
stevens,
this
system
permits
the
hiring
of
democrats.
and
two
of
the
people
here
in
the
complaint--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--well,
that
may
be,
but
if
you
look
at
11(f)--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--i
think
that
if
it
were
a
strict
political
test
it
would
be
a
more
difficult
case
for
us,
and
we
do
not
have
that
case.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
no,
i
think
that
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
this
was
a
loose
system
of
friendships
and
political
consideration,
and
not
a
strict...
the
loyalty
oath
to
the
republican
party
test.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
no,
your
honor.
they--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--yes,
they
said...
they
said
with
respect
to
new
hires
you
may
take
these
friendship
and
political
connections
into
consideration
among
qualified
candidates,
as
did
judge
baker.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
actually
it
is
not.
but
because,
if
you
look
at
paragraph
11(f),
justice
white,
you
will
see
that
the
categories
that
they
allege
here
are...
for
example,
or
is
sponsored
by
a
member
of
the
illinois
general
assembly
who
is
deemed
to
be
a
friend
or
supporter
of
defendant
thompson.
now,
the
illinois
general
assembly
for
years
has
been
controlled
by
the
democrats.
and
mr....
governor
thompson
has
many
friends
in
the
illinois
general
assembly
who
he
needs
to
get
his
program
through
who
are
democrats.
this
system
permits
the
hiring
of
democrats
as
well
as
republicans,
and
indeed
the
hiring
of
people
who
have
no
political
affiliation
whatsoever.
it
talks
about
friends
of
a
republican.
that
person
could
be
a
democrat;
it
could
be
one
with
no
political
affiliation
whatever.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
they
lack
the
connection
or
sponsorship
of
such
a
person.
that
is
correct.
except
that
two
of
them,
as
i
pointed
out
before,
o'brien
and
standefer,
were
hired
under
this
system.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
moore
was
not
hired,
and
ms.
rutan
was
not
promoted.
mr.
taylor
was
not
transferred.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
they
claim
that
it...
they
allege--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--that
is
the
allegation,
that
they
failed
to
have
the
adequate
sponsorship.
they
do
not
allege
that
the
persons
that
were
hired
or
promoted
instead
of
them
were
not
qualified
under
the
personnel
code,
and
indeed
they
were
qualified
under
the
personnel
code.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
there
is
a...
there
may
be
a
relationship
between
friendship
and
ability,
and
in--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--well,
if
you
know
a
person
and
know
his
qualifications,
it
is
often
better
than
to
employ
a
stranger.
i
think
that
is
a
matter
of
common--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--well,
these...
it
may
be
that
there
would
be
none
if
you
don't
know
anything--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
often
they
are
very
unfriendly.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
that
is
right.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
i
am
not
sure
i
understand--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--oh,
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
so,
because
it--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--well,
it
demonstrates
what
happens
to
be
the
fact,
that
you
do
not
have
to
be
a
republican
under
this
system
to
get
hired.
if...
a
friend
of
a
republican
can
be
a
democrat.
he
can
be
somebody
with
no
political
connection
whatsoever.
they
are
not
alleging
a
strict
partisan
test
in
this
case,
nor
could
they.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
that
is...
that
is
right,
your
honor,
and
we
are
saying
that
this
system--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--no,
your
honor,
i
think
not.
what
is
happening--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--i
think
that
that...
you
could
look
at
it
that
way--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--what
we
say
is
that
others
were
hired
instead,
or
promoted.
all
right?
and
that
there
is
a
major
difference
between
not
getting
the
job
and
being
fired
or
retaliated
against,
such
as
what
happened...
such
as
happened
in
the
branti
case
and
the
elrod
case.
or
in
these
other
cases,
such
as
keyishian
and
perry
against
sindermann
and
those
cases.
in--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
yes,
that
is
true.
and...
or
a
friend
of
a
member
of
the
general
assembly
who
is
deemed
to
be
a
friend
of
the
governor.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
that's
right.
i
agree
with
what
you're
saying,
justice
scalia.
the
point
i
want
to
make
is,
however,
that
you...
there
is
no
allegation
here
that
any
of
these
people
was
retaliated
against
or
demoted
for
his,
or
his
or
her
job
diminished
in
any
way
owing
to
their
lack
of
sponsorship
or
because
they
were
a
democrat
or
voted
in
the
democratic
primary.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
well,
that
person
had
been
in
that
job
in
that
county
for
years,
your
honor,
so,
it
wasn't
alleged
that
somebody
else
got
a
transfer
into
that
county.
he
applied
for
a
transfer,
he
had
been
working
in,
whether
it
was
schuyler
or
fulton
county,
for
many
years,
and
wanted
to
move
over
to
the
other
county.
he
was
denied
that
transfer.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
yes,
i
am
sure
there
are.
i'm
sure
there
are.
both
republicans
and
democrats.
in
any
event,
your
honors,
we
believe
and
submit
to
you
that
there
is
a
major
distinction
between
the...
in
the
hiring
context,
which
plaintiff
moore
has
here,
and
in
the
lack
of
promotion,
which
ms.
rutan
has
here,
between
the
kind
of
situation
where
you
had
in
elrod
where
the
political...
system
caused
the
person
to
be
fired,
or
in
many
of
these
other
cases
where
the
person
was
demoted
when
the
new
party
came
into
office.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
i
think
it
would
be,
your
honor,
in
light
of
the
countervailing
state
interest,
but--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--which...
well,
which
are
that
to
engender
activity
and
support
in
the
two
parties,
to
have
increased
participation
in
the
political
process,
an
incentive
to
those
employees
to
do
well
who
have
supported
the
party,
and
to
provide
good
representatives
of
the
incumbent
party,
and--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--well,
your
honor,
in
many
respects
the
people
who
are
in
the
jobs
that
are
lower
than
the
policy
making
are
the
ones
who
the
public
deals
with,
and
that...
those
are
the
ones
that
have
the
interaction
with
the
public
and
who
the
incumbent
administration
will
be
judged
by.
and
it
is
not
unusual,
it
seems
to
us,
that
the
incumbent
administration
would
want
to
have
persons
who
support
them
rather
than
their
opponents
out
there
dealing
with
the
public.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
yes,
your
honor,
that...
that
is
another
consideration
that
is
there,
and
the
activity
in
the
party
between
the
elections
is
another
important
thing
here
that
is
served
by
this
system.
another
factor
i
think
that's
important
to
consider,
although
it
is
not
dispositive,
i
don't
think
any
of
these
points
is
dispositive,
but
i
think
to
look
at
the
history
of
the
united
states
and
to
see
that
any
one
of
the
state
legislatures
that
wishes
to
impose
a
strict
civil
service
system,
take
a
test,
the
top
one
gets
the
job,
they
are
all
free
to
do
that.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
well,
perhaps
that
is
so,
perhaps
it
isn't
so.
but
isn't
it
up
to
each
state
and
each
mosquito
abatement
district
and
each
county
and
each
village
to
decide
that
for
themselves
and
to--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--i
think
the
history
is
very
well
defined;
it's
all
in
the
books.
thomas
jefferson
apparent...
according
to
the
books
i
have
read,
was
one
of
the
leaders
in
the
hiring
of
his
political
supporters,
and
for
good
reason,
for
obvious
reasons.
and
i
am
not
talking,
justice
stevens,
about
the
secretary
of
state.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
there
is...
there
is
lots
of
things--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--all
right,
i
am
talking
about
today,
and
i
say
that
under
the
system
that
we
have
in...
take
illinois
today.
illinois
today,
of
the
five
state
offices
that
are
elected,
three
are
in
the
hands
of
democrats
and
two...
one...
of
the
four,
one
is
in
the
hands
of
the
republicans.
now,
the
illinois
general
assembly,
which
is
controlled
by
the
democrats,
could
at
any
time...
the
democratic...
if
they
didn't
like
this
system
could
introduce
a
statute
to
change
it
and
to
change
this
personnel
code
to
say
of
those
three
top
applicants
you
must
take
the
one
that
tested
the
highest.
they
have
not
sought
or
seen
fit
to
do
so.
the
question
then
is
does
the
first
amendment
require
a
strict
civil
service
system
that
cannot
take
any
consideration
into
political
factors
or
friendship
factors.
and
it
is
our
submission
to
your
honors
that
it
does
not.
that
it
has
never
been
thought
to
do
so,
and
it
does
not.
and
to
suggest
that
every
time
one
of
these
local
governments
made
an
employment
decision
that
they
were
risking
a
federal
lawsuit
is
going
very
far
and
would
be
most
disruptive
of
the
local
governments
and
the
operation
of
the
local
governments,
which
ought
to
be
left
to
those--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--a
firing.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
well,
when
you
have
a
firing
you
have
a
specific
person
who
has
been
retaliated
against.
when
you
have
a
promotion
you
can
have
four
or
five
people
that
submit
their
applications
for
the
promotion.
each
feels
he's
the...
he
or
she
is
the
best
qualified.
similarly
with
respect
to
a
job.
you
have,
you
can
have
multiple
applicants
for
that
job.
each
of
them
can
say
i
wasn't
picked
because
i
was
not
a
friend
of
a
republican,
or
something
like
that.
so
there
you
are.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
we
say,
justice
white--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--right,
and
we...
just
to
face
right
up
to
that,
we
say
that
that
is
not
a
basis
for
claiming
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
right.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
right.
so
long
as
the
personnel
code
has
been
followed,
the
person
is
qualified
for
the
job,
and
so
long
as
there
is
no
retaliation,
there
is
no
adverse
action
taken
against
anyone.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
well,
we--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--we
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
burden
of
the...
as
you,
when
you
compare
the
subtle
expectations
in
a
job,
which
the
court
in
the
wygant
case
and
the
johnson
case
for
example
looked
at,
and
compare
that
to
the...
the
person
who
is
seeking
a
job
and
doesn't
get
the
job,
he
is
in
no
different...
he
or
she
is
in
no
different
position
than
when
he
started.
or
the
promotion.
ms.
rutan
still
has
the
job
she
had.
those
interests
are
not
sufficient
when
weighed
against
the
other
interests,
the
countervailing
interests,
to
require
that
first
amendment
exclude
all
political
and
friendship
considerations
from
these
decisions.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
no,
your
honor,
and
it
is
not--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--it
does
in
some.
it
does
in
some.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
well,
your
honor,
in...
this
system
will
benefit...
will
benefit
both
democrats
and
republicans--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--i...
i
do
not
think
it
is.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
pardon
me?
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
what
i
am
trying
to
say
is
that
i
think
it
works
both
ways.
it
does
give
benefits
to
those
who
support
the
incumbent
party,
and
it
also--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--i
am
not,
your
honor,
and
i
was
about
to
say
that...
that
it
also...
this
system
also
can
work
to
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
in
the
other
side
of
the
political
aisle,
the
democrats
can
get
hired
under
this
system,
as
two
of
these
plaintiffs
have.
so,
they
weren't
coerced
in
their
beliefs
in
any
way.
and...
but
whatever,
however
you
want
to
characterize
this
system,
you
are
talking
about
the
incidental...
the
incidental
effect
on
someone
who
is
not
selected
for
promotion
or
hire.
not
someone
who
has
been
fired
or
demoted,
or
whose
job
has
been
diminished
in
the
slightest
by
the
incumbent
administration.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
well,
we...
no,
there
is--
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
--it
is,
i
think
the
number
60,000
jobs
was
used.
however,
there
are
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
cut
across
this.
so
the
number
is
not
in
the
record,
justice
stevens.
mr.
thomas
p.
sullivan
mr.
chief
justice,
if
the
members
of
the
court
have
no
other
questions,
that
is
our
submission.
