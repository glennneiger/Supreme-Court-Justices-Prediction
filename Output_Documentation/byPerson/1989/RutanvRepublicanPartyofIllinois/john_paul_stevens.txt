justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sullivan,
would
it
make
any
difference?
supposing
they
had
a
strict
test,
would
you
defend
it?
if
you
cannot...
say
the
governor
put
out
an
order
you
cannot
be
promoted
unless
you
agree
to
vote
republican
next
year.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not,
if
he
believes
in
the
patronage
system?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
have
to
acknowledge
you
get
a
head
start
if
you
are
republican,
i
think,
don't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
isn't
the
legal
issue
the
same
whether
it
is
just
a
head
start
or
a
flat
qualification?
that
is
what
i'm...
well,
i'm
puzzled
by
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
there
are
a
lot
of
employees
who
are
unhappy,
i
suppose,
because
they
have
been
in
the
same
job
for
years
without
any
opportunity
to
go
elsewhere.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sullivan,
do
you
think
that
distinction
is
strong
enough
to
support
a
statute
that
said
no
prison
guard
shall
be
hired
who
are
not
republicans?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
what
do
you
say,
mr.
sullivan,
to
your
opponents
argument
that
a
lot
of
them
have
done
that
and
the
two-party
system
has
survived
quite
well
in
those
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
judge
ripple
made
the
suggestion
that
we
might
understand
these
issues
a
lot
more
if
we
had
a
full
hearing
at
which
the
parties
could
develop
their
evidence
and
show
how
valuable
the
system
is.
i
don't
know,
maybe
you're
dead
right.
maybe
you
won't
get
any
prison
guards
if
they
don't
agree
to
vote
republican.
i
just
don't
know.
he
thought
you
ought
to
have
a
hearing
on
it,
but
you
think
we
can
all...
we
can
take
judicial
notice
of
all
this
history.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
sullivan,
do
we
know
how
many
people
are
affected
by
this
practice
in
illinois?
justice
john
paul
stevens
nonpolicy-making,
nonconfidential
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
