mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
illinois
code
of
professional
responsibility
prohibits
attorneys
from
holding
themselves
out
as
being
either
certified
or
a
specialist.
the
policy
supporting
this
prohibition
is
that
illinois
does
not
recognize
or
sanction
any
certification
or
specialization
process.
therefore--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--the
state
does
not
do
it,
your
honor.
doctors...
the
medical
profession...
are
allowed
to
hold
themselves
out
as
being
specialists
or
board
certified.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
they
do
not
regulate
it,
though
it
is
our
argument
that
if
the
state
chose
to
regulate
those
board
certifications,
it
would
be
with...
it
would
be
within
their
authority
to
do
so.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
yes.
like
in
r.m.
j,
an
attorney
can
list
the
court
where
he
is
admitted
to
practice.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
well,
your
honor,
because
this
court
sets
the
qualifications--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--well,
they
would
be
allowed
to
say
that
they
were
admitted
in
the
court--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--to
practice
and...
and--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--i
obviously
think
that
it's
less
misleading
than
this
particular
letterhead.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
there's
three
reasons
why
petitioner's
letterhead
is
misleading.
the
first
and
most
obvious
reason
it's
misleading
is
that
to
the
reader
petitioner's
statement
implies
that
his
certification
is
sanctioned
by
the
state
or
a
governmental
authority
when
there
is
no
question
on
the
record
that
it
is
not.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
your
honor,
we...
we
believe
there's
three
reasons
why
it's
misleading.
the
first,
that
it
implies
sanction.
the
second,
that
it
impinges
upon
the
inherent
authority
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
to
set
qualifications
for
the
practice
of
law
in
illinois.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
third
reason
is
that
on
this
record
petitioner's
claim
is
an
unverifiable
claim
as
to
the
quality
of
services
he
provides.
petitioner
in
his
reply
brief
even
admits
or
argues
that
a
disclaimer
in
this
case
would
be
highly
burdensome,
and
it
is
our
argument
that
a
disclaimer
that
would
have
to
be
created
to
vitiate
the
three
components
of
why
petitioner's
statement
is
misleading
would
have
to
be
so
long,
so
detailed
as
to
be
even--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--more
confusing
to
the
public.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
well,
the
unverifiable
claim
on
this
record,
your
honor,
is
that
before
the
illinois
court
the
various
amicus
who
filed
briefs
on
behalf
of
petitioner
and
petitioner
all
stated
that
there
were
different
qualifications.
each
one
had
a
different
set
of--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--we
believe
that
it's
irrelevant
one
way
or
another
whether
it's
a
reputable
organization.
we
believe
the
important
focus
is
on
the
terms
themselves:
certified
and
specialist.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
i
don't
know
if
it
would
be
more
or
less
but
in
the
case
of
the
medical
profession
research
shows
that
the
medical
profession
has
been
certifying
specialists,
board
certifying
physicians,
for
40
to
50
years.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
well,
in...
in
the
comments
to
our
rule,
the
legislative
history,
our
court
sets
forth
that
some
day
the
court
may
see
fit
to
implement
a
certification
or
specialization
program
in
illinois.
obviously,
the
opinion
in
this
case
is
indicative
of
the
fact
that
the
court
does
not
feel
that
now
is
the
time
to
implement
a
certification
process.
we
argue
that
it's
within
the
inherent
authority
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
to
decide
when
it
is
appropriate
to
join
the
11
other
states
who
have
their
own
certification
processes.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
and
trademark.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
in
those
cases,
your
honor,
the
attorneys
who
practice
in
those
areas
are
now
allowed
to
use
the
inherently
misleading
terms
"certified"
and
"specialist".
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
i'll
go
directly
to
the
rule.
and
a
lawyer
admitted
to
practice
before
the
united
states
patent
and
trademark
office
may
use
a
designation
patents,
patent
attorney,
patent
lawyer
or
registered
patent
attorney,
or
any
combination
of
those
terms
on
his
letterhead.
a
lawyer
engaged
in
the
trademark
practice
may
use
the
designation
trademarks,
trademark
attorney
or
trademark
lawyer
or
a
combination
of
those
terms.
and
a
lawyer
engaged
in
the
admiralty
practice
may
use
the
designation
admiralty,
proctor
in
admiralty
or
admiralty
lawyer
or
a
combination
of
those
terms.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
we
believe
that
an
attorney
could
indicate
that
he
was
a
civil
trial
advocate
or
a
civil
trial
attorney,
because
that
statement
would
not
be
misleading
for
the
three
reasons
that
we've
set
out.
that
does
not
imply
state
sanction,
that
doesn't
set
a
qualification
for
the
practice
of
law.
in
other
words,
a
reader
could
not
look
at
that
statement
and
think,
but
for
that
certification
the
attorney
could
not
practice
in
that
area
of
the
law.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
that's
correct.
and
also
because
though
a
reader
might
infer
a
term
of
quality
or
a
certain
quality
because
of
that
statement
that
would
be
readily
verifiable.
all
attorneys
in
illinois--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--all
attorneys
in
illinois
are
presumed
to
be
competent
to
handle
matters
in
which
they
are
retained
to
represent
a
client.
factually,
if
an
attorney...
and
we
cited
in
our
brief
the
case
of
zimmerman
from
new
york
where
they
determined
the...
the
new
york
court
determined
that
an
attorney
who
held
himself
out
as
available
to
practice
and
was
experienced
in
25
areas
of
law
was--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--it
would
truly
be
a
question
of
fact,
though,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
he
was
a
civil
trial
advocate.
i
believe
that
would
be
something
that
a
hearing
board
in
a
preliminary
disciplinary
matter
could
determine
factually
whether
or
not--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--if--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--if
a
problem
arose
and
it
came
to
the
attention
of
the
administrator
of
the
commission
and
a
disciplinary
investigation
was
instituted
against
the
attorney,
yes,
we
would
determine
on
a
case-by-case
basis
whether
or
not
that
attorney
was
qualified
as
a
civil
trial
advocate
and
whether
his
statement
was--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
for,
again,
the
inherently
misleading
nature
of
any
certification
or
specialization
term.
a
specialization--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--that's
correct.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
again,
that
would
be
a
factual
determination.
and
just
as
an
example,
i
would
again
point
to
the
zimmerman
case,
where--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--but
if
that
was
misleading
to
the
public,
which
is
based
on
the
facts
of
the
situation,
that
an
attorney...
an
attorney
who
was
just
admitted
to
the
practice
of
the
bar
very
well
may
be
competent
to
be
a
civil
trial
advocate
in
some
situations.
but
in
order
to
take
a
case,
in
order
to
represent
a
client,
the
code...
our
code...
requires
that
the
attorney
be
competent
to
handle
that
matter.
and
if
he's--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--well,
it
requires
but
it...
all
attorneys
who
are
presumed
to
act
ethically
at
al
times
are
presumed
to
be
competent
to
handle
the
matters
where
they
are
retained.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
again,
because
of
the
inherently
misleading
nature
of
his
statement
for
the
reasons
that
we
set
forth.
and
especially
on
the--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--that's
correct.
the
reader...
and
this
is
not
just...
this
was
a
finding
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
but
it
was
supported
by
an
aba
study
that
found
that
the
terms
"certified"
and
"specialist"
themselves
have
acquired
a
secondary
meaning
to
the
public.
the
public
cannot
differentiate
between
terms
"certified"
and
"specialist"
and
the
term
"licensed",
the
term
"licensed",
which
means
sanctioned
by
an
official
entity.
"certified"
and
"specialist",
especially
on
this
record--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--that's
correct.
and
that
was
the
finding
of
both
the
illinois
court
and
the
aba
in
their
report.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
in
fact,
though,
in
this
case
we
have
argued
that
one
of
the
things
that
a
reader
might
imply
from
petitioner's
statement
is
that
the
national
board
was
recognized
by
the
state.
also,
especially
when
you
look
at
this
record,
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts.
you
have
to
look
at
petitioner's
letterhead.
specifically,
on
his
letterhead
he
has
the
name
of
his
law
office,
his
address,
his
phone
number,
and
to
the
left
in
the
same
size
print
he
lists
his
name,
then
he
lists
his
certification
claim.
and
then,
without
any
spacing,
he
places
the
words
"licensed"
and
he
places
the
three
states--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--and
in
this
case
he
is--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--but
i
don't
believe--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--your
honor,
that
the
public
would
be
sophisticated
enough
to
determine
the
true
meaning.
now,
we
as
lawyers,
we
know
that
illinois
does
not
recognize
his
certification
or
specialization
process.
but
the
reader
to
the
public...
or,
the
reader
in
the
public,
would
not
realize
that
that
claim
is
not--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--i
don't
really
understand
your
question,
your
honor.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
well,
they
would
be
misled
to
believe
that
the
state
has
certified
this
attorney
to
be
better
qualified.
he
has
attained
a
special
qualification
in
order
to
practice
in
the
area
of
civil
advocacy.
they
would
be
led
to
believe
in
an
unrealistic--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--an
unrealistic
expectation
would
be
raised
in
the
reader
that
this
attorney,
because
of
his
special
qualifications,
will
do
better
for
my
case
regardless
of
what
the
outcome--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--the
state--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--we
would
still
argue,
though,
that
the
terms
are
just
inherently
misleading
to
the
reader
regardless
of
how
there
would
be
any
disclaimer
to
them.
and
any
disclaimer
that
would
be
created
would
be
so
burdensome
and
confusing
as
to
even
confuse
the
public
even
more
than
petitioner's
statement
on
its
face.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
could
i
explain
what
the
term
advocacy
means?
just
simply
that--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--of
the
population
that
would
understand?
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
i
wouldn't
want
to
hazard
a
guess,
your
honor,
but
i
think
if
you
use
a
normal
standard
of
a
person
who
has,
let's
say,
the
median
intelligence,
they
very
well
may
have
some
idea.
but
i
would
say
that
a
large
segment
of
the...
of
the
population
would
not
even
know
what
the
term
advocacy
meant.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
because
he's
holding
himself
out
as
civil
trial.
i
believe
that
people
would
understand
that
he
was
a
trial
attorney.
i
think
most
people,
the
majority
of
people
would
understand
the
word
trial.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
but
again,
you
would
still
have
the
inherently
misleading
component
of
his
statement
in
that
the
public
would
be
led
to
believe
that
the
state
sanctioned
his
claim.
the
public
would
be
led
to
believe--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--and
that
the
state
has
sanctioned
his
claim
of
being
an
expert--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--well,
your
honor,
obviously
we
would
disagree
with
that.
in
this
case
we
believe,
for
the
reasons
that
we
set
forth,
the
fact
that
it
implies
state
sanction.
again,
state
or
governmental
sanction.
secondly,
that
it
sets
a
qualification.
and
i
really
haven't
explained
the
setting
the
qualification.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
that
came
up
when
we
argued
the
matter
before
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
and
there
is
a
written
examination
that
is
given
in
relation
to
this
test.
one
of
the
justices,
though,
on
the
court
asked
counsel
for
petitioner
the
question,
"how
do
we
know
that
the
janitor
doesn't
come
in
during
the
middle
of
the
test
and
give
all
the
applicants
the
answers
to
the
test?
"
the
attorney
responded,
"well,
your
honor,
i
guess
you
wouldn't
know
that
because
the
test
is
given
in
massachusetts
and
in
other
areas.
"
and
justice
stamos
said,
"that's
exactly
my
point,
counsel,
that
when
we
give
the
illinois
bar
examination
which
sets
the
qualification
for
the
practice
of
law
in
illinois,
we
know
that
the
janitor
doesn't
come
in
and
give
the
answers
because
the
test
is
given
under
our
authority,
by
our
agents,
and
we
control
the
entire
process.
"
in
this
case,
with
private
bar
group
associations...
and
especially
on
this
record...
how
is
the
illinois
court
ever
to
determine
what
the
real
qualifications
are
to
receive
this
certification
and
especially--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--first
of
all,
in
response
to
your
question--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--your
honor,
we
believe
that
it's...
this
court
has
held
in
the
goldfarb
decision
that
the
states
have
a
compelling
interest
in
regulating
the
profession
of
law
within
their
boundaries.
this
is
especially
true
because
attorneys--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--well,
your
honor,
it
would...
first
of
all,
the
hearing
would
have
to
be...
in
this
case,
let's
take,
for
example,
the
national
board
is
located
in
residence...
whatever
that
means...
in
boston,
massachusetts.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
it
very
well
may
be
possible
that
you
could
do
that.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
your
honor,
it
would--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--that's
correct
because
we
believe
until
the
state
recognizes,
sanction...
sanctions,
a
certification
process
or
a
specialization
process
which
we
believe
is
the--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--well,
in
the
comments
to
the
rules
the
state
does
say
that
in
the
future
we
very
well
may
find
that
it
is
appropriate
to
have
a
certification--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--or
specialization
process.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
depending
on
what
the...
no,
because
when
the
state
sanctioned
a
claim
of
certification
or
specialization,
that
would
vitiate
the
misleading
nature
of
the
statement.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
an
example,
your
honor,
is
the
two
supreme
courts,
minnesota
and
alabama,
who,
through
contested
proceedings,
have
allowed
attorneys
to
hold
themselves
out
as
being
certified
by
the
national
board
found
they
struck
down
essentially
the
same
rule
that
we
have
here.
in
both
those
cases,
the
courts
did
not
automatically
say
that
attorneys
from
this
day
forward
can
hold
themselves
out
as
being
certified
by
the
national
board.
the
court
said
that
we
direct
that
the
buyer
in
those
states
create
a
process
for
recognizing
these
certifications,
and,
in
fact,
i
assume
have
hearings
to
determine
whether
or
not
these...
these
boards
are--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--well,
that
shows,
though,
that
this
certification...
this
board
certification
here
was
still
inherently
misleading
until
the
court
set
in
motion
a
sanctioning
process
for
those
certifications
or
for
those
boards
to
obtain.
we,
in
this
case,
again
fall
back
to
our
three
arguments
why
we
believe
that
it's
misleading.
one,
it
sets
state
sanction;
secondly,
it
implies--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--the
authority
of
the
court.
thanks.
[laughter]
i
was
looking
at
the
third
trying
to
say
the
second.
and,
finally,
that
it
is
an
unverifiable
claim
of
quality,
especially
to
the
general
public.
this
is
not
dry
cleaning
or,
as
the
attorney
for
the
ftc
said,
oranges.
there
is
a
tremendous
difference
between
oranges
and
providing
legal
services.
there's
a
tremendous
difference
between
providing
legal
services
and
the
medical
profession.
we
believe
in
this
situation
that
these
misleading
statements
can
be
prohibited
for
the
three
reasons
that
we
have
stated.
the
history
of
advertising
in
illinois
shows
that
the
court
was
highly
concerned
with
the
free
flow
of
nonmisleading
commercial
information
to
the
public.
also,
attorneys
were
given
a
wide
range
of
opportunity
to
advertise.
the
rules
relating
to
advertising
are
set
forth
in
our
brief,
and
they
show
that
the
illinois
court
has
given
attorneys
in
illinois
every
opportunity
to
advertise
in
every
medium.
the
only
real
restriction
is
that
their
advertising
not
be
misleading.
in
this
case
we
ask
that
this
court
affirm
the
well-reasoned,
thoughtful
and
well-analyzed
decision
of
the
illinois
court
that
petitioner's
letterhead,
the
statement
on
his
letterhead,
is
misleading.
in
this
case,
your
honor,
petitioner's...
and
i
feel
that
i
must
mention
these...
has
also
raised
two
other
issues.
the
first
being
that
petitioner's
statement
is
not
commercial
speech.
we
have
two
short
arguments
on
this
point.
the
first
argument
is
that
petitioner
has
waived
this
argument.
petitioner
did
not
raise
this
issue
at
any
time
below.
during
five
levels
of
review
petitioner
never
mentioned
that
his
speech
was
not
commercial
speech.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
well,
in
fact,
petitioner
urged
the
lower
levels
to
consider
his
speech
as
being
commercial
in
nature
by
defending
his
statement
by
using
precedents
developed
by
this
court
in
commercial
speech
cases.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
in
response
to
his
arguments
in
response
to
his
defense
that
his
statements
under
the
attorney
advertising
decisions
of
this
court
were
proper
we
did,
yes,
retort
that
these
decisions
do
apply
in
this...
in
this
situation
because
we
believe
that
it's
obvious
that
even
if
this
court
finds
that
petitioner
hasn't
waived
this
argument,
there
is
no
question
that
petitioner's
statement
is
commercial
speech.
petitioner's
definition
that
statements
which
explicitly
propose
a
commercial
transaction
are
commercial
speech
is
meritless.
this
court's
decisions
hold
that
statements
which
explicitly
and
implicitly
propose
a
commercial
transaction
constitute
commercial
speech.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
well,
the
record
shows--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--no,
your
honor.
the
record
shows
that
petitioner
uses
this
letterhead
during
the
ordinary
course
of
his
practice
of
law
and
that
he
sends
his
letterhead
out
to
clients,
past
and
present,
and
other
attorneys
who
he
admitted
refer
a
majority
of
his
business
to
him.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
well,
or
their
clients
who
the
lawyer
says:
here's
this
letterhead;
this
is
the
guy
i
think
you
should
hire.
finally,
petitioner
makes
two
arguments
that
the
illinois
court's
prohibition
of
his
statements
violates
the
equal
protection
clause.
again,
i
will
refer
the
court
to
our
brief
to
these
arguments.
we
feel
that
there
is
a
rational
basis--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--following
your
hypothetical,
your
honor,
it
may
be
possible.
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
still,
though,
what
the
inherently
misleading
terms
"certified"
and
"specialist"
to
the
public,
and
the
public's
unsophistication
concerning
delivery--
mr.
william
f.
moran,
iii
--of
legal
services,
we
believe
that
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
create
an
effective
disclaimer
in
this
case.
in
summary
of
our
argument,
the
rules
in
question
clearly
advance
the
state's
substantial
interest
in
providing
the
free
flow
of
commercial
information
to
consumers
of
legal
services.
in
reading
the
rules,
the
comments
to
the
rules,
the
legislative
history
and
the
opinion,
it
is
clear
that
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
takes
seriously
its
responsibility
to
regulate
the
practice
of
law
in
illinois
and
to
protect
the
public
from
misleading
information.
the
illinois
court's
finding
that
petitioner's
statement
is
misleading
is
supported
by
thoughtful
well-reasoned
analysis.
the
policy
supporting
the
court's
rule
is
sound.
petitioner's
statement
can
constitutionally
be
prohibited.
we
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
lower
court's
decision.
thank
you.
