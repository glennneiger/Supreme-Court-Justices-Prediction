justice
antonin
scalia
but,
as
you've
said,
mr.
ennis,
that's...
that's
really
just
incidental.
i
mean,
the
principle
you're
arguing
for
is
that
even
if
that
weren't
all
true,
the
state's
absolute
ban
would
not
be
any
good.
they...
it
would
be
up
to
the
state
to
show
that
this
was
not
a
reputable
organization,
isn't
that...
that's
your
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
you...
what
would
you
do
if...
if
mr.
peel
put
on
his
letterhead...
instead
of
certified
by
this
organization
it
just
says
on
the
letterhead
"the
best
in
legal
representation;
new
improved
lawyering?
"
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
test?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
would
have
to
show
case
by
case
that
this
individual
is
not
the
best...
isn't
providing
the
best
in
lawyering?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
says
he's
the
best
lawyer
in
sangamon
county.
you
think
that's
not
verifiable?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
says
that
in
their
opinion
i'm
a
good
lawyer.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
a
second-hand
opinion
is
better
than
a
first-hand
opinion.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
case.
that's
pretty
tough.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
not
dealing
with
light
bulbs
here.
you're...
you're
dealing
with
the
process
of
justice
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
a
special
responsibility
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
simply
because
you
can
allow
any
organization
to
certify
something...
good
housekeeping
or
united
labs,
or
whatever
else
for
light
bulbs...
it
doesn't
mean
you
have
to
do
it
for
the
process
of
justice,
for
which
counselor
are...
are
members
of
the
bar
of
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
all...
all
you
tell
me
the
state
can
look
to
is
whether
you
have
one
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
just
a
matter
of
complexity,
it's
a
matter
of
it
being
part
of
the
process
of
justice
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
other
courts
are
charged
with
meting
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
it's
a...
it's
a
lie,
but
at
least
it's
constitutional?
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
think
that's
very
true
when
you
said
certified...
certified
trial
specialist.
yes,
i
think
the
public
would
think
that
means
certified
by
the
state.
but
when
you
say,
you
know,
certified
by
milton
berle
or
certified
by
somebody
in
particular,
why
does
that
necessarily
indicate
the
state?
i
mean,
that's
just
not
plausible.
it's
just
not
plausible.
you...
you're
not
arguing,
are
you...
it
might
be
a
plausible
argument
to
say
that
the
public
might
believe
that
any
organization
mentioned
as
being
the
certifier
has
been
reviewed
by
the
state
of
illinois.
maybe
that's
plausible.
but
that
isn't...
that
isn't
your
argument,
is
it?
and
that
isn't
what
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
relied
on.
they
didn't
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
public
would
think
that
illinois,
like
a
lot
of
other
states,
or
11
other
states,
has
actually
examined
this...
this
association
to
see
whether
they're
worthy
of
certifying.
that...
but
that
isn't
your
point,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
just...
what
is
the...
supposing
a...
a
substantial
number
of
readers
mistakenly
think
there
was
some
kind
of
an
illinois
approval
of
the
organization
when
there
wasn't?
what
harm?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ennis,
i've
been
thinking
about
your
assertion
that
the
source
of
confusion
said
to
exist
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
is
that
they
think
that
certified
means
certified
by
illinois.
i
don't
think
that's
what
the
court
said.
i
think
all
the
court
said
is
when
you
say
certified
by
the
nbta
the
average
person
would
think
that
that
is
a
permission
to
practice,
that
the
nbta
is
somehow
an
official
organization.
the
supreme
court
doesn't
say
that
they'll
think
that
constitutes
illinois
approval.
but
when
you
say
nbta>
["]
and
then
under
that
"licensed
by
the
state
of
illinois.
"
i
think
the...
the...
the
unsophisticated
person
reading
that
might
well
think
that...
that
indeed
the
more
important
thing
is
that
you're
certified
by
nbta,
which
is,
for
all
they
know,
some
official
organization.
why
isn't
that
correct?
