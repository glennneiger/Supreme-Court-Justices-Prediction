well,
what
if
it
isn't
a
bogus
organization
but
some
little
two-bit
club
that
the
lawyer
truthfully
says
he
belongs
to
and
they've
recognized
him
and
given
him
some
certificate?
that's
fine,
i
take
it.
and--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
state
has
to
permit
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
does
an
average
consumer
know
anything
at
all
about
this
organization?
they're
not
even
listed
in
the
telephone
directory
in
some
cities.
and
how
is
the
average
person
to
have
any
feeling
at
all
about
what
that
organization
represents?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
ennis,
what
does
the
certification
here
tell
the
consumer?
does
it
tell
the
consumer
that
the
lawyer
has
had
a
good
win/loss
record
in
cases
in
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
do
you
think
the
average
non-law-trained
person
would
think
that
it
might
indicate
or
might
encompass?
specialized
training
or--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--win/loss
or
lots
of
experience?
what
is
it--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--we're...
we're
to
think
that
that
means?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
illinois
does,
however,
permit
lawyers
to
disclose
their
specialization
in
some
areas...
patent,
admiralty
and
what's
the
other?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
trademark.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
are
they
allowed
to
do
in
those
areas?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
a
lawyer
who
is
engaged
primarily
in
civil
litigation
practice
cannot
so
indicate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
illinois
would
permit
that,
although
it
isn't
expressly
allowed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
would
it
be
readily
verifiable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if...
if
the
lawyer
chose
to
engage
in
a
civil
litigation
practice
and
so
indicated
on
the
letterhead,
and
the
lawyer
in
fact
was
newly
admitted
to
practice
and
had
had
only
a
trial
or
two
before
doing
this,
illinois
would
nonetheless
permit
that
chosen
designation
on
the
letterhead?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
that
what
illinois
does?
is
it...
is
it
set
up
to
examine
those
claims
individually
and
determine
the
extent
to
which
the
attorney
has
in
fact
had--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--trial
experience?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
say
it
is
too
burdensome
to
do
that
with
regard
to
this
organization's
certification
even
though
you're
perfectly
willing
to
do
it
in
the
other
instance?
