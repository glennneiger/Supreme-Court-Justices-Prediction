justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
we
know
that?
that
it's
highly
respected?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
is
all
in
the
record,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
uh-huh.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
state
recognize
it
as
a...
as
an
organization
that
certifies
specialists?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
it
really
does
make
a
lot
of
difference,
contrary
to
what
you
said
earlier,
what
kind
of
an
organization
this
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
seem
to
say
it
does
make
a
lot
of
difference.
it
has
to
provide...
this
statement
has
to
provide
meaningful
information.
and
i
take
it
from
what
you've
said
in
your
answers
that
whether
it
provides
meaningful
information
or
not
depends
on
what
kind
of
an
organization
it
is.
this
two-bit
club?
no.
but
this
group,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if--
justice
byron
r.
white
--if
this
is
commercial
speech.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
this
is
commercial
speech
that
these...
that
he's
putting
out?
is
your
rule
of
applying
a
narrower...
or
the
requirement
that
they
use
a
less-restrictive
means
is
that
really...
will
that
really
get
you
very
far
if
it's
[inaudible].
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
commercial
speech?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
what
is...
what
he...
what
he
says.
he
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
organization.
he
just
says
that
i'm
certified
by
so
and
so
and
so
and
so.
and
i
thought
you
said
a
while
ago
that
if
he
put
on
his
letterhead
that
i've
been
certified
by
this
little
club
that
no
one
ever
heard
of
that,
as
applied,
this
blanket
ban
would
be
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
it
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
he
could
put
on...
he
could...
he
could
put
on
his
letterhead
that...
that
he
had
been
certified
by
some
club
that
no
one
had
ever
heard
of
and
he
could
use
it...
and
he
could
say
you
cannot
keep
me
from
doing
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--because--
justice
byron
r.
white
--now,
wait
a
minute.
you
cannot
get...
you
cannot
make
me...
you
cannot
keep
me
from
doing
this
under
this
blanket
ban.
as
applied
to
me
even,
this
ban
is
bad.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what...
yeah,
but
what's
your
view?
what's
your
view
of
how
he
would
come
out
if
he
put
on
his
letterhead
that
this
little
club
name
that
no
one
ever
heard
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so,
it's
just
overbroad
is
it,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
you
seem
to
say
that
if
the...
if
the
state
sorted
groups
out
and
said
here
are
the
groups
that
we
recognize
and
here
are
the
groups
that
we
don't,
that
they
could...
that
they
could
do
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
don't
you
go
ahead.
maybe
i
can
follow
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
you...
even
if
you've
just
been
admitted
for
a
day
and
have
never
been
in
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
facts
for
determination...
i
mean,
it's
true,
he
won't
do
anything
but
civil
litigation.
that's
his
intention,
and
it's
hard
to
disprove
that,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
presumed
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about...
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
say
"ever"
what's
wrong
with...
what's
wrong
with
doing
what
you
say
the
bar
does
often?
that
you
go
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
and
you
say,
well,
this
is
misleading.
well,
how
do
you
know
it's
misleading?
why
shouldn't
you
have
a
hearing
and
say,
well,
is
this...
is
this
claim
of
some
kind
of
a
specialty
or
expertise
misleading
and
why
couldn't
you
determine
that
this
organization
is
really
a
pretty
high-class
organization
that
actually
tests
people's
qualifications
before
they
certify
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
hearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's...
what's
wrong
with
the
suggestion
that
you
could
really
tell
what
kind
of
an
organization
this
is
that
did
the
certifying
in
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
might
be
hard
but
i...
just
on
the
merits
of
the
hearing
do
you
think
you
could
conclude
that
this
organization
is
a
perfectly
legitimate
high-class
organization
that
really
has
high
standards
for
admission?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
you
had
the
hearing
and
you
said,
you
cannot
be
certified
by
this
organization
unless
you've
had
lots
of
experience
and
you're
highly
qualified?
what
if
you
made
that...
had
that
conclusion
after
a
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
this
man
could
still
be
prevented
from
putting
it
on
his
letterhead?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
state
isn't
about
to
do
that,
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though--
justice
byron
r.
white
--even
though
indicating
that
some
special
expertise
might
be
inherently
misleading?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
a
hearing
that
showed
this
organization
really
was...
really
had
high
standards
might
do
the
same?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
wrong
with
that...
what's
wrong
with
that
result
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
your
second
one
is
that
it
impinges
on
the
authority
of
the
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
anybody
say
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
did
the
state
ever
argue
that
the
standards
governing
commercial
speech
be
applied
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
that
the
only
way
the
state
claimed
this
was
misleading
was
that
it
implied
a...
approval
by
the
state
that
this
was...
organization
was
sanctioned
by
the
state
or
this
certification
was
sanctioned
by
the
state.
and
suppose,
as
i
think
you
probably
agree,
that
that
could
be
negated,
that
inference
by
a...
something
on
the
letterhead
to
the
contrary.
would
you
think
the
state
would
be
required
to
use
that
means
to
cure
the
problem
rather
than
this
blanket
ban?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be
possible.
do
you
think
the
state
is
required
to...
in
this
commercial
speech
area
to
use
that...
that
less
intrusive
way
of
curing
the
problem?
