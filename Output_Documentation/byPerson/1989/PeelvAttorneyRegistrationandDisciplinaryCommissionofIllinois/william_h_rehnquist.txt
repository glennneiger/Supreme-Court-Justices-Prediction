chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
no.
89-1775,
gary
peel
v.
the
attorney
registration
and
disciplinary
commission
of
illinois.
mr.
ennis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
of
your
case,
mr.
ennis,
depends
on
the
stature
of
this
particular
organization?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
it
were
the
sangamon
county
trial
lawyers'
association
with
a
membership
of
about
six
in
rotating
musical
chairs,
that
would
still
be
true,
so
long
as
the
statement
were
not
false?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that's
a
simple
step,
mr.
ennis.
but
actually,
that
could
involve
a
fairly
substantial
commitment
of
resources
on
the
part
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
ennis.
mr.
marzen,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
marzen,
how
would
this
particular
certification
on
mr.
peel's
letterhead
help
consumers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that
would...
that
a
lay
person
would
understand
the
significance
of
that
certification?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
would
have
pretty
well
killed
the
usefulness
of
the...
of
the
letterhead,
too,
wouldn't
it?
perhaps
you
say
that
illinois
should
be
pleased
with
that
result.
if
you...
i
mean,
are
you
really
winning
much
for
mr.
peel
if
you
say
he
can
put
this
on
but
after
it
the
state
can
require
him
to
put
it,
this
is
not
a
certification
by
the
state
and
it
does
not
import
any
claim
of
expertise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
you
said--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
the
state
could
require
not
only
the
disclaimer
but
that
this
does
not
imply
any
claim
of
expertise.
what's
your
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
that
you
didn't
say
it
or
no
that
you
wish
you
hadn't
said
it?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
moran.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
excuse
me.
does
illinois
allow
you
to
say
practice
limited
to
civil
litigation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
does
allow
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
moran.
mr.
ennis,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
ennis.
the
case
is
submitted.
