but
that's
not
true,
is
it?
it...
it
does
imply
a
claim
of
expertise.
i
mean,
that...
now
we're...
now
we're
just
saying
that
the
state
can
impose
something
that
isn't
true.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
you
say
the
state
should
not
be
allowed
to
require
a
disclaimer
as
to
this
ad?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
where
do
we
come
out
here?
that
the
state
of
illinois
in
your
view
could
not
constitutionally
require
a
disclaimer
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i...
i--
--i
thought
you
said
it
would
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
a
question
as
to
whether
it's
appropriate.
it's
whether
or
not
it's
permitted.
