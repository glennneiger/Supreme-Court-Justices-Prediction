justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one...
one?
does
the
state
permit
a
member
of
the
bar
to
list
on
his
letterhead
that
he's
a
member
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
bar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
think
that's
perhaps
more
misleading
than
this...
this...
particular--
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
that
imply
that
they've
been
here
a
lot
and
argued
a
lot
of
cases
and
we
know
them
very
well?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
think
that's
more
or
less
misleading
than
this
particular
letterhead?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what's
misleading
about
this
letterhead?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course
that
could,
as
your
opponent
just
suggested,
easily
be
corrected
by
saying
not
a
government
organization
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
they
can't
set
unconstitutional
qualifications,
can
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
unverifiable
point--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
there
any
distinction
between
this
and
the...
and
the
board
certification
in
the
medical
fields
that
justice
blackmun
asked
about?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose
they've
changed
over
the
time.
but
there
isn't
really
any
doubt
about
the
fact
that
this
is
a
pretty
reputable
organization,
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
again,
going
back
to
the
medical
because...
do
you
think
that
this
is
less
verifiable
than
the
number
of
examinations
a
particular
specialist
in
some
medical
field
might
have
had?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
how...
but
how
can
these
people
ever
get
started?
that's...
that's
one
of
the
arguments
your
opponents
made.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
doesn't
that
presumption
cover
this
lawyer
insofar
as
he
represents
he's
a
competent
lawyer
able
to
try
civil
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
he
thinks
the
average
reader
will
think
that
he's
specially
certified
by
illinois
even
though
it
doesn't
say
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
public
in
illinois
can't
make
that
distinction
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
omitted
the
words
by
the...
certified
trial
specialist
by
the
national
board
of
trial
advocacy.
and
after
that,
the
licensed
by
the
three
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
that
when
he
says
civil
trial
specialist...
i
mean,
certified
by
the
national
board
of
trial
advocacy,
the
reader
will
think
he
was
certified
by
some
illinois
organization?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
great
harm
would
come
if
the...
if
the
uninformed
reader
thought
the
organization
had
been
certified
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
when
it
hadn't.
it
had
been
certified
by
somebody
and
perhaps
looked
at
a
lot
more
closely
than
the
illinois
supreme
court
looks
at
all
these
lawyers
who
get
this
presumption?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
exactly
what
he
has.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
not
the
better
for
my
case.
he
does
in
fact
have
all
these
extra
qualifications,
though.
he's
had
a
lot
of
trials,
he's
passed
a
lot
of
exams,
and
this
is
an
organization
which
encourages
people
to
take
this
training
so
they
can
make
a
truthful
representation
that
they
have
extra
training.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the...
if
the
reader
thinks,
well,
perhaps
illinois
sponsored
it,
and
that's
wrong,
the
essential
message
is
still
absolutely
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
this
letter
was
written
to
your
organization,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
didn't
promote...
isn't
that
what
the...
the
only
thing
in
the
record
is
he
wrote
to
the
disciplinary
commission.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
and
so
part
of
the
misleading
public
were
other
lawyers
who
were
also
terribly
confused
by
this.
