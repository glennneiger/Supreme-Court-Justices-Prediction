mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
letterhead
contains
the
truthful
and
verifiable
statement
of
fact
that
he
has
been
certified
as
a
civil
trial
specialist
by
the
national
board
of
trial
advocacy,
a
highly
respected
organization
of
judges
and
lawyers
whose
certification
program
has
been
endorsed
by
the--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
record
that
the
national
board
of
trial
advocacy
is
a
reputable
and
nonbogus
organization.
it
is
sponsored
by
seven
national
organizations,
including
the
national
district
attorneys'
association,
the
association
of
trial
lawyers
of
america.
on
its
governing
board
sit
many
judges,
including
judges
in--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--this
is
in
the
record
below.
yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
there
is
no
dispute
about
that
fact.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
state
does
not
recognize
any
organizations
to
certify
specialists.
in
the
hearing
below,
the
state
took
the
position
that
it
was
not
going
to
argue
one
way
or
another
about
whether
the
national
board
of
trial
advocacy
provided
meaningful
information
or
not.
the
state
was
willing
to
assume
that
the
national
board
of
trial
advocacy
certification
did
provide
meaningful
information
to
consumers.
nevertheless,
the
state
thought
that
in
order
to
prevent
bogus
organizations
from
springing
up,
the
state
needed
to
have
a
complete
categorical
ban,
a
prophylactic
rule
which
prohibited
all
statements
of
certification.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
it
does
not
matter
at
all
because
this
court's
decisions
made
clear,
beginning
with
r.m.
j
and
followed
in
shapero
and
zauderer,
that
the
states
cannot
place
an
absolute
ban
on
potentially
misleading
speech.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
we
do
not
quarrel
with
the
ability
of
the
state
to
regulate,
to
make
sure
that
statements
by
certifying
organizations
do
provide
significant
and
meaningful
information
to
consumers.
the
state
could
adopt
a
regulatory
scheme
and
could
prohibit
statements
about
certification
by
bogus
organizations.
that
is
not
this
case.
illinois
has
not
tried
to
distinguish
between
bogus
organizations
and
meaningful
organizations.
illinois
has
attempted
to
prohibit--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
think
that
the
same
test
would
apply
but
in
that
circumstance
application
of
the
test
may
permit
the
state
to
ban
statements
of
certification
by
that
particular
organization
on
the
ground--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--on
the
ground
that
those
statements
of
certification
do
not
provide
significant
or
meaningful
information
to
consumers
and
are
potentially
deceptive
and
cannot
be
proved--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
as
the
ftc
will
argue
as
amicus,
petitioner's
statement,
like
statements
like
physicians
that
they
are
board
certified,
does
provide
meaningful
and
relevant
information
to
consumers.
consumers,
if
they
want,
can
go
to
the
trouble
to
find
out
what
being
a
board
certified--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor...
justice
white,
i
think
if
the
state
had
a
regulatory
process,
it
would
make
a
lot
of
difference
whether--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
our
position
is,
and
i
think
it
is
the
same
test,
the
same
rule
this
court
applied
unanimously
in
r&j
and
later
in
shapero
and
zauderer,
that
the
state
cannot
have
a
blanket
prohibition
on
potentially
misleading
speech,
as
a
speech
by
a
bogus
organization
might
be,
if
there
are
regulatory
mechanisms
which
could
eliminate
the
deception.
here
there
are
at
least
four,
and
maybe
five,
simple
and
reasonable
regulatory
mechanisms
that
illinois
could
use
to
eliminate
any
potential
for
deception
by
bogus
organizations.
first,
illinois
could
itself
on
an
ad
hoc
basis
approve
certifying
organizations
as
meeting
its
standards
for
what
provides
meaningful
information.
second,
illinois
could--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
rehnquist,
it
certainly
could
provide...
require
some
commitment
of
resources,
but
less,
i
think,
than
the
administrative
burden
this
court
has
already
upheld
in
the
other
attorney
advertising
cases.
in
zauderer
and
in
shapero
this
court
upheld
requirements
and
suggested
that
in
order
to
regulate
potentially
misleading
speech
the
state
could
require
filings
of
all
speech
with
the
state
and
then
on
a
case-by-case
basis
the
state
could
make
a
decision
about
whether
that
particular
speech
was
or
was
not
misleading.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that
is
a
greater--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
white?
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
hope
so
because
i'm
relying
principally
on
your
opinion
for
the
court
in
zauderer,
which
was
a
commercial
speech
case,
which
squarely
ruled
that
states
cannot
prohibit
potentially
misleading
information
if
reasonable
regulatory
measures
would
suffice
to
cure
the
deception.
zauderer--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
we
argue
in
our
briefs
that
this
speech
should
be
categorized
as
fully
protected
speech
rather
than
commercial
speech.
but
because
this
case
can
and
should
be
decided
on
the
narrower
ground
that
even
if
it
is
commercial
speech
it
cannot
be
categorically
prohibited,
i
will
rely
on
the
arguments
in
our
brief
to
support
the
broader
ground.
let
me
make
clear
that
illinois
has
not
argued
that
its
prophylactic
ban
is
a
reasonable
accommodation
between
first
amendment
interests
and
the
state's
interests.
instead,
illinois
has
argued
that
no
accommodation
is
necessary
because
there
is
no
first
amendment
interest
to
be
protected.
that
argument
is
based
solely
on
the
conclusory
assertion,
without
any
support
in
the
record,
that
all
statements
of
certification
or
specialization
will
inevitably
and
necessarily
mislead
consumers.
but
as
the
federal
trade
commission
will
argue
as
amicus,
petitioner's
statement,
like
the
statements
by
physicians
that
they
are
board
certified,
provides
relevant
and
meaningful
information
that
will
promote
informed
consumer
decisions.
petitioner's
statement,
according
to
the
ftc,
is
not
even
potentially
misleading,
and
even
if
it
were,
there
are
numerous
reasonable
regulatory
measures
that
would
eliminate
any
potential
for
deception.
and
illinois
has
not
even
bothered
to
consider
those
regulatory
measures,
much
less
prove
that
they
would
not
suffice.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
not
at
all.
and
that
is
a
quite
different
situation.
a
good
win/loss
record,
a
statement
about
a
good
win/loss
record,
might
imply
success,
that
the
attorney
will
be
able
to
be
successful
for
the
client.
this
is
not
that
at
all.
a
statement
of
certification--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think
that
the--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
average
person
might
reasonably
think
that
certification
by
the
national
board
of
trial
advocacy
would
imply
something
about
experience
in
civil
trials
and
a
knowledge
of
basic
procedures
in
civil
trials,
which
is
exactly
what
nbta
certification
does.
in
order
to
be
certified
by
nbta,
as
the
minnesota
supreme
court
ruled,
nbta
certification
is
based
upon
a
rigorous
and
exacting
set
of
requirements
which
require
proof
of
five
years
of
practice
in
civil
trials,
including
at
least
30
percent
concentration
in
each
year
in
civil
trials;
lead
counsel
in
15
completed
trials,
including
five
jury
trials
and
at
least
45
full
trials
days;
lead
counsel
in
an
additional
45
litigated
matters;
45
hours
of
continuing
legal
education
in
civil
trial
practice
in
the
previous
three
years;
confidential
peer
review
by
both
judges
and
lawyers
of
the
attorney's
trial
abilities;
a
substantial
trial
brief;
and
a
day-long
written
examination
which
tests
knowledge
of
evidence,
ethics,
substantive
and
procedural
law
and
trial
tactics.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
same
test
would
apply.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
same
test.
but
under
that
test,
the
statement
has--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--that's
not
exactly
my
answer,
justice
scalia.
that
is
a
different
factual
circumstance
from
this
case
because
it's
a
statement
of
opinion.
"i
am
the
best
lawyer
in
the
east
coast.
"
is
a
statement
of
opinion.
it
is
not
verifiable.
a
statement
by
peel
that
he
has
been
certified
by
the
national
board
of
trial
advocacy
is
a
statement
of
fact.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no,
i
think
it's
certainly
not
verifiable,
your
honor.
i'm
sure
that
some
other
lawyers
in
sangamon
county
would
disagree
with
that
assessment.
it's
a
very
different
circumstance
to
say
a
statement
of
opinion,
"i'm
the
best
lawyer
in
the
universe.
"
on
the
one
hand
and
say,
"as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
have
been
certified
by
a
highly
reputable
organization.
"
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
which
says
that--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--it's
not
just...
it's
not
just
their
opinion.
it's
not
an
ad
hoc
basis,
justice
scalia.
nbta
certification
is
based
upon
a
rigorous
set
of
preexisting
standards
and
qualifications.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
that--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
believe
that
a
blanket
ban
is
never
acceptable
in
this
circumstance.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
that
is
not
necessarily
correct
because
this
court's
opinions
made
clear
that
[inaudible].
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
my...
my
view
is
that
that
statement
could
not
be
banned
if
the
justification
for
the
ban
is
a
prophylactic
ban
that
all
such
statements
must
be
banned.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
it's
not
just
overbroad
because
it
applies
to
peel.
he's
not
arguing--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--about
the
rights
of
other
people
and
saying
that
his
speech
would
not
be
protected
but
the
rights
of
others
would.
he
is
arguing
that
his
speech
itself
is
constitutionally
protected
because
it
provides
meaningful
information.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
but
i
didn't
quite
follow
that,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
let
me...
let
me
point
out
that
the
three
ways
in
which
illinois
claims
that
petitioner's
speech
could
be
misleading
are
not
self-evident
and
they
are
not
based
on
any
empirical
evidence,
any
study,
or
any
expert
opinion
that
that
speech
would
be
misleading.
illinois
first
suggests
that
a
statement
of
certification
will
imply
that
the
state
itself
has
certified
or
has
endorsed
the
certification.
but
as
the
ftc
will
argue,
it
is
implausible
to
believe
that
consumers
will
think
certification
by
the
national
board
of
trial
advocacy
is
certification
by
the
state
of
illinois.
furthermore,
even
if
there
were
evidence
that
petitioner's
statement
was
potentially
misleading
in
that
way,
there
are
many
simple
regulatory
measures
to
cure
that
misleading
statement.
first
is
a
simple
requirement
for
a
disclaimer.
illinois
could
require
attorneys
to
say
on
their
letterheads
that
certification
does
not
mean
or
imply
certification
or
approval
by
the
state.
second,
there
could
be
ad
hoc
approval
of
certifying
organizations.
third,
there
could
be
approval
of
certifying
organizations
pursuant
to
preexisting
standards
and
criteria
that
illinois
would
find
to
be
meaningful.
fourth,
there
could
be
case-by-case
review
of
all
such
statements,
as
this
court
found
would
be
a
reasonable
regulatory
burden
in
zauderer
and
in
shapero.
and
finally,
the
states
themselves
could
engage
in
certification
of
attorneys,
as
11
states
have
done.
under
nbta
requirements,
if
a
state
provides
itself
for
certification
of
attorneys,
nbta
will
not
certify
an
attorney
until
the
attorney
has
first
been
certified
by
that
state.
in
all
these
ways
the
entirely
speculative
fears
of
illinois
could
be
cured
through
reasonable
regulatory
measures.
with
respect
to
the
burden
point
that
you
raised,
justice
rehnquist,
let
me
simply
say
that
in
zauderer
the
court
said,
quote,
"our
recent
decisions
involving
commercial
speech
have
been
grounded
in
the
faith
that
the
free
flow
of
commercial
information
is
valuable
enough
to
justify
imposing
on
would-be
regulators
the
costs
of
distinguishing
the
truthful
from
the
false,
the
helpful
from
the
misleading
and
the
harmless
from
the
harmful.
"
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
i
think,
your
honor,
that
so
long
as
the
state
has
not
bothered
to
distinguish
at
all
between
the
harmful
and
the
harmless,
the
answer
would
be
yes,
the
state
would
be
relegated
to
a
case-by-case
approach.
so--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--but
our
argument
is
that
the
state
could
adopt
reasonable
regulatory
mechanisms
to
review
that
kind
of
speech
as
well
as
this
kind
of
speech,
which
is
a
very
different
kind
of
speech.
the
state
in
illinois
has
not
bothered
to
do
that.
and
as
this
court's
decisions
made
clear,
illinois
cannot
impose
a
prophylactic
ban
on
useful
speech
simply
to,
quote,
"spare
itself
the
trouble"
of
distinguishing
between
the
harmful
and
the
harmless.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
in
response
to
questions
from
justice
o'connor
and
justice
white,
the
state
acknowledged
that
illinois
does
not
have
a
blanket
rule
which
prohibits
attorneys
from
saying
they
concentrate
their
practice
in
civil
trials,
even
though
there
is
no
objective
standard
in
illinois
for
what
concentrate
means.
instead,
illinois
reviews
those
claims
under
a
different
rule,
rule
2101,
which
prohibits
any
misleading
claim
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
that
is
exactly
the
rule
we
are
arguing
for
here.
there
is
no
more
justification
for
a
blanket
ban
on
this
statement
than
there
is
for
a
blanket
ban
on
statements
that
illinois...
in
illinois
that
attorneys
concentrate
their
practice.
to
the
contrary.
concentrate
means
something.
in
nbta
certification
it
means
the
attorney
has
spent
at
least
30
percent
of
his
time
in
the
previous
five
years
in
civil
trials.
justice
kennedy
asked
a
question
about--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--first,
your
honor,
that
speculation.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
there
is
that
potential
for
deception.
even
if
there
were
such
evidence,
that
also
could
be
cured
by
a
simple
requirement
of
a
disclaimer
statement
or
by
the
other
regulatory
measures
we
have
addressed.
so,
as
in
zauderer,
because
the
potentially
misleading
statement
can
be
cured
through
regulation,
a
prophylactic
ban
is
impermissible.
justice
kennedy
raised
a
question
about
expertise.
in
zauderer
the
court
ruled
that
states,
quote,
"may
not
prevent
an
attorney
from
making
accurate
statements
of
fact
regarding--
"
