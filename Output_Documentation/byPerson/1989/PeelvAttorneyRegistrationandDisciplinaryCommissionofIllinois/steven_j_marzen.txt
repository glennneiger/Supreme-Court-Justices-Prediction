mr.
steven
j.
marzen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
behalf
of
the
federal
trade
commission
i'd
like
to
make
two
submissions
this
morning.
first,
that
mr.
peel's
certification
claim,
and
other
claims
like
it,
are
valuable
commercial
speech.
and
second,
that
certification
claims
cannot
be
entirely
prohibited
by
the
state
on
the
record
in
this
case.
first,
information
about
lawyer
certification
is
valuable
commercial
speech.
the
first
amendment
protects
commercial
speech
on
the
theory
that
it
performs
a
valuable
function
in
allocating
resources
in
a
free-market
economy.
among
other
things,
such
information
helps
consumers
pick
out
desirable
goods
and
services.
the
first
amendment
theory,
as
applied
to
this
case,
would
indicate
that
information
about
lawyer
certification
would
help
consumers
pick
out
lawyers
who
are
particularly
competent
to
handle
their
particular
problems.
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
well,
if
a
consumer
had
a
problem
that
involved
litigation,
they
could
look
for
someone
who
is
certified
as
a
civil
trial
specialist
by
the
national
board
of
trial
advocacy,
in
comparison
to
another
practitioner
who
didn't
have
any
certification
or
also
didn't,
through
looking
at
martindale-hubbell
or
something
else...
didn't
have
any
indication
that
he
had
courtroom
experience
for
example.
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
a
lay
person
certainly
isn't
going
to
know
that
nbta
certification
means
all
the
specific
things
that
are
required
to
get
the
certification.
he's
not
going
to
know
that
it
requires
15
trials,
five
jury
trials
or
a
minimum
of
45
days
trial
experience.
at
the
same
time,
the
vast
majority
of
people
in
this
courtroom
probably
wouldn't
know
what
tests
a
product
had
to
go
through
to
get
an
underwriter's
laboratory
certification.
he
or
she
will
know,
however,
that
the
certification
implies
that
the
attorney
has
passed
some
tests,
some
tests
with
bite,
that
are
related
to
the
subject
area
of
the
certification.
and
that's...
that's
the
sort
of
implied
claim
that
a
certification
statement
makes.
and
in
that
case
it's
true.
i
detected
in
the
questions
posed
to
previous
counsel
some
limits
as
to
what...
or
some
questions
as
to
what
is
left
for
the
states
if
you
recognize
the
ability
of
an
attorney
to
say
that
i'm
a
certified
civil
trial
specialist,
or
any
other
certification
claim.
and
in
the
federal
trade
commission's
view,
substantial
leeway
is
left
within
a
wide
zone
of
reasonableness
for
states
to
continue
regulating.
within
the
certification
area,
for
example,
if
the
organization
had
a
musical
chairs
requirement
or
just
had
the
requirement
that
one
pay
a
certain
fee,
a
state
could
of
course
prohibit
that
in
their
entirety.
the
reason...
the
theory
would
be
that
those
claims
do
not...
or
that
the
requirements
of
the
certification
organization
have
no
relationship
at
all
to
the
implied
claim
the
consumer
would
read
from
the
certification.
in
addition,
depending
on
what
the
state
reasonably
finds
the
reasonable
consumer
to
understand
the
claim
to
be,
the
state
could
prohibit
claims
by
certification
organizations
with
insufficient
requirements.
for
example,
in
this
case
if
the
state
of
illinois
had
found
that
a
reasonable
consumer
assumes
that
a
civil
trial
specialist
has
at
least
tried
one
case,
they
could
forbid
organizations
from...
or
forbid
people
from
making
claims
that
they
are
certified
as
a
civil
trial
specialist
by
an
organization
that
didn't
have
those
particular
requirements.
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
excuse
me?
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
well,
what
one
has
to
realize
is
that
this
is
sort
of
a
dynamic
process.
there
were...
there
was
a
time
in
the
medical
profession
and
in...
in
certain
products
where
they
were
just
starting
certification.
and
in
those
cases,
consumers
did
not...
you
know,
the
certification
took
more
and
more
meaning
over
time.
for
instance,
the
sunkist
grower's
association...
you
know,
who
knew...
who
knew
what
sunkist
meant
when
it
first
started
out?
it
was
a
group
of
people,
you
know,
growing
oranges.
over
time,
though,
it
became--
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
--that's--
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
--absolutely
true
and
the
legal
services--
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
--no.
it
depends
on
what
the
assumption
of
reasonable
consumers
are.
for
example,
if
one...
over
time
there
may
be
more
and
more
state
certification
and
certification
by
more
and
more
private
entities.
just
as
in
the
medical
profession,
you
may
evolve
towards
higher
and
higher
standards.
unless
you
allow
the
process
to
get
started,
however,
you're
never
going
to
reach
that
higher
goal.
there's
no
question
but
that
you're
correct
that
legal
services
are
far
more
complex,
and
claims
that
you
wouldn't
allow
in
the
areas
of
products,
for
example,
would
not
be
allowed
in
terms
of
legal
services.
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
i
understand
that
it's
part
of
the
process
of
justice,
but
in
fact
allowing
people
to...
to
announce
and
to
disseminate
information
about
certification
is
in
the
very
highest
traditions
of
the
standards
of
the
bar
in
maintaining
and
improving
the
quality
of
advocacy
and
all
other
forms
of
service.
as
the
study
cited
on
page
2
of
our
brief
in
this
case
indicate,
more
than
90
percent
of
the
people
who
suffered
serious
property
damage,
employment
discrimination
or
had
problems
with
their
landlords,
don't
go
see
a
lawyer.
those
exact
same
studies
reveal
that
the
principal
barrier
is
because
people
don't
know
that
there
is
a
particular...
can't
find
a
particular
lawyer
who
they
feel
is
competent
to
deal
with
the
problem.
that
same...
another
study
cited
in
that...
our...
our
same
ftc
submission
indicates
that
in
certain
copy
tests
with
276
individuals,
that
when
you
give
them
information
about
professional
qualifications
they...
the
intentions
to
go
out
and
obtain
legal
services
increases.
justice
is
a
very,
very
important
goal.
but
the
information
that
is...
that
would
be
disseminated
as
a
result
of
this
case
is
in...
would
actually
help
promote
justice.
it
would
help
people
who
have
serious
legal
problems
vindicate
public
and
private
rights.
and
that
is
a
significant
interest
weighing
in
the
balance
on
the
other
side.
the
state,
of
course,
has
substantial
leeway
to
prohibit
false
or
misleading
claims
but
it's
not
necessary
to
reach...
to
have
a
prophylactic
ban
to
do
so.
in
fact,
in
this
particular
case
the
state
of
illinois
had
already
means
to
achieve
all
of
its
goals
with...
with
far
less
intrusion
on
first
amendment
costs.
specifically,
the
claims
of
the
state
of
illinois
are
that
someone
reading
gary
peel's
certification
statement
and
any
other
certification
statement
would
think
that
there
was
an
implied
claim
of
either
state
sponsorship
or
an
implied
claim
that
gary
peel
is
a
superior
trial
lawyer.
if
those
claims
are
accurate,
which
we
disagree
for
the
reasons
in
our
brief
and
i
can
elaborate
on,
the
state
of
illinois
could
have
had
a
prophylactic
disclaimer
saying
that
certification
is
not
by
the
state
and
infers
no
claim
of
expertise.
that
would
have
cured
any
potential
confusion
or
deception,
and
it
would
have
not
trenched
nearly
on
the
first
amendment
interests
that--
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
--not
as
much
as
i'd
like,
justice
rehnquist.
it's
better
than
a
flat
ban
on
any
certification
statements
and
it
would
probably
require
the
attorney
to
make
the
certification
information
useful
to
specify
more
about
what
the
standards
of
the
certifying
organization
were.
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
that's...
we...
okay.
the
two
points
i
would
make
is
that
it's
less
intrusive.
we
would...
i
entirely
agree
with
your
point,
though,
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
the
state
should
not
be
allowed
to
require
a
disclaimer.
disclaimers
are
extremely
valuable
when
there
is
some
potential--
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
--yes.
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
no.
not
at
all.
[laughter]
it's
not
a
lie
at
all.
the
express
statement
in
this
case
is:
i
have
been
certified
as
a
civil
trial
specialist
by
the
nbta.
that
is
absolutely
true.
there
are
implied
claims,
however,
which
may
or
may
not
be
intentionally
made
that
could
be
confusing
or
deceptive.
when
one
is
dealing
with
such
implied
claims,
the
experience
of
the
federal
trade
commission
is
that
you
can
address
an
implied
claim
by
an
express
statement
that
is...
an
express
statement
that
that
is
not
what
i
meant.
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
i
would
not
think
that
a
disclaimer
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
okay.
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
we...
the...
on
behalf
of
the
federal
trade
commission,
a
disclaimer
would
not
be
permitted
by
the
constitution
in
this
case.
my...
my
initial
claim
was
directed
to
the
fact
that
the
state
had
lesser
intrusive
measures
that
it...
that
it
could
have
considered--
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
--that
would
have
entirely
remedied
what
it
had--
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
--my
answer
is
no.
the
state--
mr.
steven
j.
marzen
--the
latter,
justice
rehnquist.
[laughter]
