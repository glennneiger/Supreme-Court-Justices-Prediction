justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
am
i
correct,
mr.
daubman,
that
even
if
you
had
no
classes
that
related
to
scuba
diving
or
athletics
you
would
still
maintain
that
a
scuba
club
would
be
non...
would
be...
would
not
make...
not
convert
the
school
into
a
limited
public
forum,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
your
test
was
a
little...
was
one
that,
if
the
school
could
sponsor
the
activity
as
a
curriculum
activity,
that
it
would
be
all
right
to
have
a
club,
even
though
it
didn't
have
a
class.
for
example,
supposing
you
had
a
french
club,
but
you
had
no
french
classes.
would
you
say
that
would
make
it
a...
bring
the
act
into
play?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
your
view.
i'm
not
asking
you
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
the
reasons?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
there's
no
foreign
language
department...
let
me
push
you...
but
you
still
want
to
have
a
french
class
on
the
theory
that
it's
the
kind
of
activity
a
school
can
sponsor
without
getting
into
all
these
sensitive
issues?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
may
i
ask
you
a
question?
supposing
they
have
a
course
in
government
and
that
it
would
be
related
to
government
to
have
a
young
democrats
club
or
a
young
republicans
or
a
young
communist
club,
would
you
say
that
those
could
be...
and
membership
confined
to
those
who
wanted
to
advocate
joining
that
particular
group
and
supporting
its
policies,
would
that
be
curriculum
related?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
said
they
weren't
going
to
do
that,
i
know.
but
my
question
is,
suppose
they
did?
would
that
be
curriculum
related,
under
your
definition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
suggesting,
in
other
words,
that
congress
intended
to
allow
that
kind
of
latitude
in
the
clubs
and
not
allow
the
religious
groups
to
meet?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
isn't
it
true
that
one
of
the
costs
of
having
a
noncurriculum-related
club
is
that
you
must
allow
not
merely
religious
groups
but
political
groups?
the
ku
klux
klan,
perhaps,
and
advocacy
of
free
use
of
drugs
and
things
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
have
a
chess
club,
the
price
you
pay
for
that
is,
you
must
let
all
these
other
groups
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
a
chess
club
is
noncurriculum
related?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
but
you
would
not
say
that
any
of
the
groups
in
the
category
that
advocate
particular
points
of
view
are
curriculum
related,
would
you,
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
can
put
anything
on
the
curriculum,
under
that
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
you
indicated
that
the
democrat
or
republican
club
would
be
noncurriculum
related
because
it's
adversarial.
i
don't
see
why
that
follows.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
in
your
brief
i
thought
you
endorsed
the
test
that
congressman
goodling
advocated,
and
he's
quoted
on
page
70
and
71
of
your
brief.
you
seem
to
have
walked
away
from
that.
or...
what
is...
i
don't
really
understand
whether
you're
still
advocating
that
position
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
first
there's
a
subject
matter
of
the
meeting
of
the
type
which
a
public
school
could
sponsor.
now,
obviously
it
couldn't
sponsor
republican
points
of
view
to
the
exclusion
of
other
points
of
view,
so
that
would
take
them
out.
and
the
second
test
was...
was
does
the
school
or
school
teacher
require,
or
directly
encourage,
student
participation
in
that
activity,
and
obviously,
again,
a
public
school
couldn't
encourage
people
to
vote
republican.
but
that
test
would
take
care
of
this
hypothetical,
but
you
seem
to
have
abandoned
that.
whereas,
it
would
take
care
of
things
like
the
chess
club
and
stuff
that
isn't
very
controversial.
it
would
draw
a
line
between
advocacy
groups
that
would
require
you
to
open
the
door
to
other
points
of
view
and
those
that
are
obviously
neutral
and
perfectly
proper
for
a
school
to
sponsor.
but
you
seem
to
have
abandoned
that
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
that
test
solve
most
of
these
hypotheticals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
school
does
not
teach
any
physical
education
courses
at
all.
would
a
football
team
be
required...
trigger
the
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
they
said
no,
but
in
terms
of
just
looking
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
why
wouldn't
it
or
would
it?
what
is
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
you
don't
have
coaches.
you
just
have
a
faculty
sponsor
who
referees
the
games.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
act
could
or...
obviously,
it
could--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know.
what
you're
saying
is
congress
wanted
the
schools
to
make
the
choice
between
clubs
of
this
character
and
opening
it
up
to
things
like
sponsoring
drugs
and
ku
klux
klan
and
political
advocacy
and
all
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that's
the
price,
is
it
not,
if
you...
if
you
become
a
public
forum.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
if
you...
if
you
say
it's
a
limited
public
forum,
that's
the
consequence.
all
these
other
groups
must
also
have
access
to
the
school
facilities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
your
view
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
not
the
use,
just
the...
advocating
change
in
the
law
to
make
it
permissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
also
true
that
the
school
policy
had
been
rather
clear
that
they
would
not
permit
a
young
republican
or
a
young
democrats
club
to
be
formed,
so
there
was...
probably
nobody
would
bother
to
apply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
would
be
an
impermissible
educational
decision
to
say
we
would
rather
have
none
of
these
groups
at
all
and
if
we
have
to
abolish
all
clubs,
we'll
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me...
let
me
just
take
it
one
step
further.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
government
identifies
four
clubs
that
they
say
make
it
a
limited
club.
supposing
after
the
case
is
decided
and
you
win
and
the
government's
position
is
upheld,
they
say
well,
we'll
cancel
those
four
clubs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
permissible
under
the
act,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
also
these
other
groups
we've
talked
about
also
have
the
same
right,
like
the
ku
klux
klan
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
congress
was
motivated
by
treating
all
of
them
equally
with
one...
one
another.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
find
in
the
legislative
history
a
predominant
interest
in
the
religious
groups?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
find
in
the
legislative
history
a
predominant
interest
in
protecting
the
religious
groups?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
can't
be
the
spending
power,
because
there
is
no...
no
remedy
of
the
cut
off
of
funds
here.
it
has
to
be
the
latter,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr....
mr.
solicitor
general,
then
you
say
a
football
team
would
do
it
if
there's
no
athletic
program?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
i
mean
your
reading
of
the
statute,
what
would
that
do?
i
know
congress
didn't
think
that;
that's
perfectly
clear.
but
under
your
reading
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
you
had
a
bright
line
test
for
reading
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
have
an
awful
lot
of
meetings
to
do
before
they
can
play.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
that
different
from...
why
is
that
different
from
chess?
why
is
that
different
from
chess?
you've
got
no
athletic
program,
you've
got
no
chess
program
in
your
regular
class.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
formal
classes,
no
curriculum...
no
athletic
curriculum.
and
no
physical
education
courses.
no
physical
education
classes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
xxx.
was
it
might
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
your
test,
the
literal
one,
the
same
one,
and
if
you
don't
have
a
french
class
but
you
have
a
french
club,
that
triggers
the
act,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
is
that
legislative
history
sufficient,
in
your
view,
to
overcome
the
plain
language
of
the
act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
the
chess
club?
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
the
colloquy
on
the
chess
club
was
much
more
ambiguous
than
you
portrayed
it,
between
senator
gorton
and
senator
hatfield.
