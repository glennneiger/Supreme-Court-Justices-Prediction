justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
daubman,
one
of
your
clubs
involves
helping
handicapped
children.
wasn't
that
one
of
the
clubs
which
you
related
to
your
curriculum
because
you
said
that
it's
part
of
the
responsibility...
there
is
no
class
in
that.
it
was
just
a
means
of
teaching
community
responsibility,
as
i
recall.
isn't
that
your
justification?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
that's
for
the
club...
for
a
club
to
be
entitled
to
be
admitted
under
the
act,
it
has
to
be
student
initiated,
but
i
don't
read
the
act
anywhere
as
saying
that
for
purposes
of
the
test
of
the
act,
of
whether
you're
a
limited
forum,
the
club
has
to
be
student
initiated.
where
does
it
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
says
"a
public
secondary
school
has
a
limited
open
forum
whenever
such
school
grants
an
offering
to
or
opportunity
for
one
or
more
noncurriculum-related
student
groups.
"
it
does
not
say
student
initiated.
it
says
student
initiated
later,
when
it
describes
the
type
of
club
that
is
entitled
to
plead
the
benefit
of
the
act.
that
has
to
be
student-initiated,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
any
act,
whether
it's...
any
club,
whether
it's
initiated
by
the
school
itself
or
by
a
student,
triggers
the
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
make
this
point
in
your
briefs?
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
about
the
chess
club?
what...
how
is
that
curriculum
related?
that
is
related
to
math,
as
i
recall.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that
the
federal
statute
prohibits
that.
that...
that's
why
i
didn't
understand
your
sponsor
argument.
you're
saying
since...
since
the
state
requires
a
faculty
sponsor
for
all
these
other
groups,
and
since
it
can't
provide
the
same
kind
of
a
faculty
sponsor
for
these
groups,
perhaps
because
of
establishment
reasons,
therefore
it
doesn't
have
to
comply
with
the
act.
but
i
don't...
i
think
the
act
overrides
your
ability
to
simply
say,
every
student
group
will
have
a
faculty
sponsor.
where...
why
do
you
think
you
have
a
right
to
do
that,
any
more
than
you
have
a
right
to
say
every
student
group
shall
have
no
more
than
30
people?
the
act
wouldn't
permit
you
to
exclude
a
religious
group
that
has
50
people
on
the
basis
that
we
don't
have
any
student
groups
with
more
than
30
people,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
because
you
had
a...
because
you
had
sponsors?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
it
takes
to
make
it
faculty
related,
is
that
you
have
a
sponsor
on
the
faculty
who
directs
the
group,
and
the
group
can
be
engaged
in
any
subject
whatever.
i
mean,
pick
whatever
you
want.
if
you
think
chess
is
faculty
related,
i
hesitate
to
suggest
something
that
might
not
be.
but
pick
something
that
you
think
is
and...
and
put
a
faculty
sponsor
in
charge
of
it.
it
would
then
be
curriculum
related?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
daubman,
i...
tell
me
if
i'm
correct,
that
i
think
that
you're
using
the
term
"curriculum"
to
mean
not
just
the
formal
courses
that
are
taught
in
the
school.
am
i
correct
in
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
you
are
saying
that
anything
becomes
part
of
the
school's
curriculum
if
the
school
wants
to
teach
it,
even
if
the
school
wants
to
teach
it
only
through
these
extracurricular
activities...
so-called
extracurricular.
i
mean,
that's
sort
of
a
contradiction
in
terms.
you're
saying
that
the
curriculum
includes
the
noncurriculum.
justice
antonin
scalia
basically.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
[laughter]
i
think
most
of
us
who
use
the
term
"curriculum"
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
doesn't
require...
doesn't
permit
you
to
apply
that
limiting
factor.
it
says
if
you
have
a
limited
public
forum,
which
it
doesn't
define
as
a
public
forum
that
admits
controversial
clubs.
it
just
says
if
you
have
a
limited
public
forum
you
have
to
admit
all
sorts
of
clubs,
including
controversial
clubs.
justice
antonin
scalia
justice
white
doesn't
think
much
of
legislative
history,
mr.
sekulow.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sekulow,
but
you
would
make
this
exception
to
your
curriculum
related...
you
would
consider
it
to
be
part
of
the
curriculum
if
the
student...
if
the
school
is
devoting
a
substantial
amount
of
its
resources
specifically
to
running
or
directing
the
club?
for
instance,
if
it
doesn't
have
a
music
course
but
has
a
school
band
and
pays
a
conductor
of
the
school
band?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
other
groups
may
have
been
included,
the
ku
klux
klan
and...
and
whatever,
because
of
our
establishment
clause
jurisprudence
suggesting
that
you
cannot
accommodate
religion
without
accommodating
everybody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
moral
formation
is
part
of
your
school...
what
the
schools
try
to
teach
as
well
and...
and
i
suppose
religious
groups
are
as
closely
related
to
moral
formation
as
your...
your
helping
the
handicapped
club
is
to
sensitivity
or
whatever
you...
whatever
value
you
said
was
being
taught
by
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then
if
you
allowed
the
one,
you
should
have
been
allowing
the
other.
