could
teachers
at
different
schools
take
different
positions
about
whether
or
not
the
chess
club
is
curriculum
related?
suppose
you
have
two
identical
schools,
two
identical
chess
clubs,
but
one
math
teacher
says
well,
i
think
this
is
curriculum
related
and
the
other
says
it
isn't.
are
we
bound
by
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
i'm
asking
is,
what
is
the
test
for
a
curriculum-related
club?
is
it
what
the
faculty
thinks,
or
what
this
court
thinks?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
did
he
make
findings
of
fact?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
he
make
findings
of
fact
that
all
the
clubs
were
curriculum
related?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
test
could
two
math
professors
at
two
different
schools
disagree
as
to
whether
or
not
a
chess
course
was
directly
related,
assuming
their
textbook
is
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i'm
not
sure.
so...
so,
you're
saying
that
as...
as...
as
a
matter
of
law
chess
clubs
are
directly
related
to
the
math
curriculum?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
if
a
math
professor
disagrees
with
that?
