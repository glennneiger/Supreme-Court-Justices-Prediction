justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't
know.
this...
do
you
think...
what
is
the
standard
of
review
on
this
issue?
do
you
think
it's
a
factual
determination?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
if
it's
a...
it
has
to
be
clearly
erroneous
to
overturn
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
what
the
eighth
circuit
did.
didn't
even
say
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
would
be
arguing
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
would
be
arguing
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i'm
not...
are
you
sure
it's
a
factual
determination
that's
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
this
issue
is
open
to
de
novo
review
by
the
court
of
appeals,
i
would
suppose
they
know
more
about
what's
curriculum
related
in
omaha
than...
is
this
in
omaha?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
omaha
than
we
do.
i
would
suppose
we
might
just
accept
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
about
this
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
define...
purport
to
state
a
standard
for
deciding.
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
interrupt?
what
do
you
think
the
test
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
justice
kennedy
asked
you
awhile
ago...
i
think
i...
i'm
afraid
i
interrupted
before
you
could
really
answer
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
fact.
in
fact,
so
it's--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
is
truly?
what
is
truly?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
know...
you
don't
know
whether
there's
been
a
lot
of
people
that
applied
who...
do
you
know
who's
applied?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
isn't
it
also--
--sounds
unsafe.
justice
byron
r.
white
sounds
unsafe.
justice
byron
r.
white
you...
the...
you...
you
win
this
case
and
they
close
down
the
club
system,
and
you
suggest
that
they
constitutionally
could
not
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
keep
your
group
off
the
campus?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
there's
a
constitutional
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
--that's
a
different
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
unrelated.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
just
restates...
that
isn't
very
illuminating.
you've
just...
all
you've
done
is
put
in
the
word
"direct".
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
is
it
just
going
to
be
a
formal
thing
because
a
logic
is
sort
of
a...
an
extension
of
the
mathematics
course?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
logic?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
teach
logic
in
the
school,
and
the
best
way...
one
of
the
best...
one
of
the...
one
of
the
ways
of
stirring
up
interest
in
it
is
a
chess
club.
justice
byron
r.
white
mathematics?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
act
doesn't
list
chess
clubs
or
anything
like
that.
that's
just
legislative
history.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
still
haven't
given
me
much
help
on...
what
is
your
standard?
the
only
thing
you've
said
so
far
is
that
it
has
to
be
sort
of
a
direct
relationship,
and
then
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
you're
bound
by
the
legislative
history.
justice
byron
r.
white
i've
been
reading
subversive
literature.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're...
the
more
you
spell
this
out,
the
more
it
sounds
like
the
court
of
appeals
missed
the
boat.
i
don't
read
anything
like
that
in
the
court
of
appeals
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
there
isn't
any.
there
isn't
any.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
we
arrive
at
some...
which
it
sounds
like
we
have
to,
or
might,
anyway,
some
definition
of
that
"curriculum
related".
don't
you
think
we
ought
to
remand
to
see
if
the...
have
the
court
of
appeals
apply
it,
which
it
never
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
get
credit
or
anything
else.
that's
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
gather
if
you...
you
say
there
has
to
be
some
connection
with
some
particular
part
of
the
curriculum.
i
suppose
that
would
vary
then
from
semester
to
semester
as
to
whether
the
french
club
was
or
wasn't
within
the
act,
or
whether
some
of
these
other
things
would--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
every
year?
or
every
year?
