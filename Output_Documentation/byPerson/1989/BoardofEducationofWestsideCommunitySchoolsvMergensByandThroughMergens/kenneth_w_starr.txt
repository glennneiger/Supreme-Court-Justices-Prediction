mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
view
of
the
united
states,
careful
study
of
this
statute
and
of
the
record
compiled
by
the
congress
in
the
course
of
considering,
of
vigorously
debating
and
enacting
this
measure,
reveals
two
overriding
concerns
or
values.
the
value
of
fairness
and
evenhandedness,
of
equality,
in
the
treatment
of
public
secondary
school
students.
and
the
value
of
liberty,
especially
first
amendment
the
liberties
assured
to
all
of
our
citizens,
those
who
are
deeply
religious
and
those
who
are
not.
as
one
of
the
co-sponsors
of
this
overwhelmingly
bipartisan
measure,
senator
leahy
of
vermont
put
it,
this
bill
makes
an
important
statement
about
ideas.
it
says
that
ideas
are
sacred
to
americans,
whether
or
not
they
concern
religion.
it
says
that
student-initiated
religious
groups
have
the
same
rights
to
meet
on
school
property
during
noninstructional
time
as
any
other
groups.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
certainly
groups
cannot
be
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--of
treating
them
equally,
subject
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
i
think
the
primary
thrust
was
to
protect
religious
liberty,
because
the
problem
that
presented
itself
to
congress
was
one
of
discrimination
that
was
visited
on
the
heads
of
students
who
wanted
to
participate
in
religious
discussion.
it
is
quite
clear,
it
could
not
be
clearer,
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
eliminate
discrimination
against
students
who
were
religious
and
who
wanted
to
engage
in
religious
discussion
voluntarily.
i
quite
agree
with
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
bill
was
originally
drafted
so
as
to
provided
protection
only
to
religious
groups.
there
was
concern
that,
by
virtue
of
constitutional
interpretations
of
this
court
and
other
courts,
the
statute
should
speak
neutrally,
to
include
political,
philosophical
and
other
grounds.
i
hasten
to
add,
however,
that
congress
was
quite
clear
with
respect
to
the
authority
of
schools
to
maintain
order
and
discipline.
subsection
f
of
section
4071
was
inserted
for
the
very
purpose
of
achieving
tinker
kinds
of
concerns
with
respect
to
disruption.
this
measure
was
not
only
intended
to
eliminate
discrimination,
but
it
was
intended
to
achieve
a
sensitive
balancing,
a
sensitive
balancing
of
rights,
and
what
was
recognized
to
be
a
very
difficult
and
sensitive
area
for
the
country.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
believe
its
authority
derives
under
the
spending
powers
of
article
1,
section
8,
and
also
by
virtue
of
the
statement
with
respect
to
any
number
of
members
of
the
house
and
the
senate,
its
authority
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
eliminate
discrimination.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
however,
justice
stevens,
that
the
congress
saw
fit
to
apply
this
statute
only
to
schools
that
receive
federal
financial
assistance,
i
suppose
if
we
had
a
grove
city
kind,
as
it
were,
of
public
school
system
that
eschewed
any
federal
funds,
this
would
not
apply.
although
i
would
think
that
under
this
court's
decisions
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
there
might
very
well
be
power
to
reach
that
school
[inaudible].
but
congress
saw
fit
not
to
exercise
the
entirety
of
its
power
in
that
respect.
the
discussion
has
been
not
about
congress'
purposes
and
intentions
and
motives
at
all,
but
rather
with
respect
to
the
meaning
of
curriculum
related.
there
are
three
reasons
why
we
would
urge
to
the
court
not
to
embrace
the
school
district's
open-ended
approach.
we
believe,
first,
that
its
approach
is
quite
inconsistent
with
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
curriculum.
the
word
curriculum
means
the
aggregate
of
courses...
courses
offered
by
the
institution.
it
was
that
common
meaning,
secondly,
that
one
most
readily
discerns
in
reading
the
legislative
history.
in
particular,
the
description
by
senator
hatfield,
one
of
the
co-sponsors
of
the
senate,
who
described
curriculum-related
clubs
as
those
that
are,
in
effect,
extensions
of
the
classroom.
and
by
the
express
admission
at
trial
of
the
principal
of
westside
high
school,
dr.
findley,
peer
advocates...
it
was
discussed
at
trial;
it
was
the
subject
of
testimony
at
trial.
at
page
277
of
the
trial
transcript,
dr.
findley
stated
that
peer
advocates
was
not
related
to
any
course
at
westside.
that,
in
our
view,
is
sufficient
to
trigger
the
act.
third,
the
school
board's
approach--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
don't
think
congress
contemplated
that
if
we're
guided
by
the
legislative
history--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
believe
that
is
a
matter
of
considerable
confusion.
i
would
not--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--if...
if...
i
were...
if
i
were
interpreting
this
statute,
i
would
say
it
would
not,
because,
justice
stevens,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
rather
odd
to
describe
the
school
football
team
as
a
student
group
wishing
to
conduct
a
meeting.
that's
not--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--they
certainly
have
meetings--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
it's
not
the
ordinary
way.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
if
there
is
no
athletic
program
at
all--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
then
it
might
very
well
be.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
might
very
well
be.
it
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
is
certainly
clear
that
congress
was
focusing
on
what
the
course
work
was.
however,
it
also
was
mindful
of
the
fact
that
there
is
a
history
of
competitive
athletics...
and
i
think
it's
quite
clear
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
did
view
the
athletic
teams
as
not
creating
a
limited
open
forum.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
i
don't
think
that
the
plain
language,
with
respect
to
a
student
group
wishing
to
conduct
a
meeting,
is
crystal
clear
with
respect
to
the
football
team.
i
think
it
is
clear
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--to
the
history
of
student
activities
in
the
united
states.
there
is
considerable
testimony
at
trial
that
student
activities
were
in
fact
student
initiated.
i'm
not
sure
that
football
teams
have
that
same
history.
they
may.
but
the
history
of
student
activities
is
that
students
coming
together
in
school
wanted
to
pursue
areas
and
activities
of
interest
to
the
students;
administrators
were
resistant
to
that.
and
ultimately,
in
the
fullness
of
time,
school
administrators
began
permitting
students
to
pursue
their
interests
just
as
westside
and
other
high
schools
across
the
country
have
seen
fit
to
do
here.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
believe
that
the
course
would
have
to
be
offered
every
single
semester.
but
it
would
have
to
relate
to
course
work.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
might
not
even
have
to
be
offered
every
year.
but
it
does
seem
to
me,
in
light
of
congress'
use
of
the
term
curriculum
and
its
discussion
of
any
number
of
groups...
the
chess
club,
which
does
exist
at
westside
was
considered
the
quintessential
noncurriculum-related
club,
even
though
it
obvious--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--quite
right.
justice
stevens,
i
completely
agree.
in
fact,
senator
gorton
conducted
extremely
skillful
cross
examination
of
senator
hatfield.
it
will
be
recalled
that
senator
gorton
thought
that
the
act
would
be
much
clearer
if
you
eliminated
political
and
philosophical
and
made
it
quite
clear
that
all
you
were
trying
to
protect
were
religious
groups
by
virtue
of
the
discrimination
that
was
being
visited
upon
religious
students.
i
thank
the
court.
