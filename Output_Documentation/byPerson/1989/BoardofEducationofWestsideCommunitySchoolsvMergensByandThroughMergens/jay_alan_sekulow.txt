mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
students
of
westside
high
school
who
desire
to
form
a
student-initiated,
student-led
and
voluntary
bible
club
do
acknowledge
that
the
school
officials
have
important
and
oftentime
delicate
functions
to
perform
with
regard
to
the
operation
of
schools
under
their
control.
however,
these
concerns
do
not
justify
the
prohibition
of
these
students'
bible
club
from
the
westside
high
school
campus.
at
issue
at
westside
high
school,
and
what
is
before
the
court
today
is
whether
one
or
more
noncurriculum-related
clubs
existed,
which
would
then
trigger
congress'
equal
access
act.
the
peer
advocates
club,
which
was
discussed
at
trial,
was
an
admission
by
the
principal
himself
that
that
particular
club
was
not
related
to
any
of
the
curriculum
activities
of
westside
high
school.
the
pretrial
stipulation
that
was
discussed
by
the
petitioners'
attorney
related
to
ten
clubs
that
were
designated
to
be
discussed.
however,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
that
same
stipulation
did
not
state
that
they
would...
that
the
respondents
would
in
any
way
not
challenge
other
club
activities.
the
school
officials
themselves
have
set
forth,
if
you
will,
the
way
in
which
to
make
the
determination
of
whether
a
particular
club
is
related
to
the
curriculum.
and
our
test
for
whether
the
act
would
be
triggered
would
be
whether
there
is
a
direct
relationship
between
the
club
and
a
core
curriculum
course
or
a
curriculum
course.
for
instance,
in
defining
the
clubs,
as
it
has
in
its...
in
the
joint
appendix
there
is
a
listing
of
the
various
student
groups
and
student
clubs
that
meet
at
westside
high
school.
one
of
the
clubs,
distributive
education
club,
is
listed
by
the
schools
as,
in
fact,
an
extension
of
the
course
in
distributive
education.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
congress
discussed
that
and
in
the
legislative
history
addressed
that
also.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
think
in
fact
that
the
existence
of
the
football
team
with
no
physical
education
still
could
have
the...
the...
the
relationship
which
would
not
trigger
the
act
because
of
the...
the
coaches
being
involved
to
the...
such
a
extent,
the
paid
salary
of--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--oh,
i
think
then
in
that
situation
that
the
act
could
apply,
in
fact.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
it
would
apply,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
and
the
reason
that
i
think
congress
in
looking
at
that
issue,
and
what
they
were
looking
at
is
more
of
the
typical
situation
where
the
school
has
the
football
team
and
the
team's
a
little
bit
different
than
the
clubs.
also,
the
act
does
not--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--no,
we're--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--my
response
to
that
is
this,
your
honor,
that
congress
wanted
to
eliminate
invidious
discrimination
against
religious
and
political
speech.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
for
instance,
i
would
not
think
that
a
club
for--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--not
with
relate
to
a
group
that
would
be
advocating
drug
use
and
drug
abuse.
i
would
say
no.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
because
that
is...
congress
addressed
that
in
the
act
and
stated
at...
under
section
d,
number
5
that
to
sanction
meetings
that
are
otherwise
unlawful
and
a
group
that
was
promoting
the
use--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--that
would
be
covered
by
the
act.
that
would...
that
is
the
price...
that's
the
price
of
freedom
and
what...
in
fact,
one
of
the
early
cases
involving
the
implementation
of
the
equal
access
act
involved
political
speech:
student
coalition
for
peace.
they
wanted
to
form
a
group
to
discuss
nuclear
freezing,
and
they
were
denied
access,
and
they,
in
fact,
utilized
the
equal
access
act,
and
the
third
circuit
did,
in
fact,
grant
them
equal
access.
but
what
the
act
also
does,
and
as
the
petitioners
have
conceded
today,
we're
not...
and
i
think
the
act
really
does
protect
this...
congress
did
not
ask
the
schools
to
surrender
control
to
the
facilities.
they
did
not
say,
if
you
will,
open
the
door
for
the
parade
of
horribles.
for
instance,
in
1969
this
court
in
the
tinker
decision
allowed
certain
expressions
of
speech
to
take
place
on...
on
the
high
school
campuses,
and
there's
yet
to
be
that
real
parade
of
horribles.
now,
congress
was
concerned
about
groups
going
over
the
line,
if
you
will,
and
what
i
mean
by
the
line,
it's
advocating
illegal
activity
and
things
like
that.
and
congress
was
specific,
number
one,
adopted
the
test
that
this
court
enunciated
in
tinker
in
saying
that
any
type
of
group
or
organization
that
would
be
materially
disruptive
or
interfere
with
other
students'
right
to
learn
would,
in
fact,
not
have
to
take
place
in
the
school.
also,
going
further
than
what
was
really
addressed
in
tinker,
and
different
as
well,
congress
sought
to
make
sure
that
school
administrators,
as
the
petitioners
in
fact
have
stated,
would
be
entitled
to
protect
the
well-being
of
students
under
their
control.
and
i
want
to
state
here
that
the
only
club
that
has
been
denied
access
based
on
the
content
of
the
speech
in
this
particular
case
has
been
the
proposed
bible
club
which
was
to
meet--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--there
was
statements...
and
actually
that
was
addressed,
your
honor,
in
the
lower
court,
and
what
was
discussed
there
was
there
was
a
club
that
was
going
to...
a
soccer
club
was
actually
going
to
be
formed,
and
there
was
a
lack
of
student
interest
involved.
and
there
was
a
dungeons
and
dragons
club
proposed
which
was
denied,
not
based
on
content,
but
based
on
safety
concerns
that
the
school
administration
had
with
regard
to
allowing
that
particular
club
to
exist.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
it
does
sound
unsafe,
yes.
[laughter]
we
agree
that
that
could
have
been
an
unsafe...
an
unsafe
club.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
well,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
however,
that's...
as
justice
scalia
stated,
that's
specifically
what
the
equal
access
act
and...
granted,
some
of
their
policies,
many
of
their
policies,
were
before
the
adoption
of
the
act.
but
i
would
find
it
very
difficult
to
have...
i'm
frankly
perplexed
by
a
school
not
allowing
a
young
democrat
and
a
young
republican
club
to
meet
on
campus.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
i
do.
i
think
that's
when
this
court
would
have
to
intervene
because
if
that
was--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
that's
exactly
what
the
school
board
in
this
particular
case
has
stated
they
would
do.
that
if,
in
fact--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--they
have
the
right
to...
there's
nothing
in
the
act
that
prohibits
them
from
closing
down
the
club
forum.
there
would
be
constitutional
issues
implicated
at
that
point,
as
we've
stated
in
our
brief.
one
of
our
concerns
is,
in
fact,
that
the
school
board
has
stated
that
in
the
event
this
court
or
a
court
were
to
determine
that
under
the
equal
access
act
a
limited
open
forum
were
to
exist,
that
they
would
recommend
to
the
school
board
that
the
clubs
be
cancelled.
now,
does
the--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--absolutely,
your
honor.
there's
no
question
that
the
schools
have
to...
do
not
have
to
allow
any
type
of
extracurricular
activity.
we
take
it
a
step
further,
and
one
of
the
concerns
that
we
expressed
in
our
brief
is
that
there
are
other
constitutional
implications
here,
but
under
the
act
they
certainly
have
that
type
of
discretion
to
absolutely
close
down
the
forum
if
they
so
elect.
yes,
your
honor?
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
no,
your
honor.
they
could
close
down
the
club
system
absolutely.
what
they
could
not--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--keep
my
group
off
the
campus
in
this
context,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
and
that
is
this:
the
school
board,
and
the
testimony
at
trial
stated
clearly,
and
it's...
it's
really
unequivocal
that
informal
meetings
on
a
regular
basis,
even
so
far
as
meeting
at
lunch
on
a
regular
basis
with
a
bible
open
and
discussing
the
bible
or
these
students
discussing
each
other's
spiritual
concerns
that
they
had
or
religious
concerns
that
they
had
or
religious
viewpoints,
if
that
was
done
on
a
regular
basis
during
lunch,
not
any
kind
of
extracurricular
activity
period,
that
they
would
prohibit
that
activity.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
that
they...
yes.
their
position
is
that
at
westside
high
school
they
desire...
the
rationale
they
gave
was
to
present
a
balanced
view,
and
that
allowing
this
type
of
speech
activity
would
not
present
a
balanced
view.
and
therefore...
i'm
not
trying
to
argue
their
position,
obviously...
that
they
would
not
have
to
allow
a
group
that
would
advocate
a
position.
however,
it's
interesting
that
no
particular
group,
no
particular
discussions
took
place
with
what
exactly...
prior
to
the
denial,
what
exactly
these
students
intended
to
do.
and
what
they
wanted
to
do
was
read
the
bible,
pray
and
encourage
one
another
with
regard
to
the
issues
that
they're
going
to
face
at
westside
high
school
on
a
daily
basis.
for
instance,
and
as
the
petitioners
stated,
the
school
is...
does
have
controversial
discussions
on
topics
ranging
from
abortion
to
homosexuality
to
drug
abuse.
but
what
they've
really
done
is
deny
these
students
the
right,
even
outside
of
the
particular
club
forum
here,
to
meet
on
a
regular
basis
during
lunch
to
discuss
those
concerns.
but
under--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--some
of
them,
yes.
many
times
they
were
in
class
with
a
teacher
present.
however,
planned
parenthood
came
in
for
an
open
module
section,
and
sometimes,
as
the
testimony
stated,
sometimes
the
teacher
was
there
and
sometimes
the
teacher
wasn't.
and
we're
not
saying
that
the
school
has
to
surrender
its
control
of
allowing
controversial
subjects
to
be
discussed
in
class.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
these
students
in
nature
of
30
other
clubs
existing
at
westside
high
school,
many
of
which
on
their
face
are
not
related
to
the
curriculum
as
they...
really
to
take
the
position
that
anything
that
relates
to
the
missions
and
goals
is
thereby
curriculum
related
and,
therefore,
it
does
not
trigger
the
act
really
does,
as
it
was
pointed
out
earlier,
circumvent
exactly
what
congress
was
trying
to
prohibit.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
your
honor,
my
test
is
simple,
and
that
is,
is
the
particular
club
directly
related
to
the
class
and--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--your
honor,
i
think...
i'd...
i...
i
would
say
this.
i
do
believe
it
does
provide
a
barrier
or
a...
a...
a
standard,
if
you
will,
because
the
clubs
listed
by
the
school
in
their
listing
of
student
organizations
without
even
dealing
with
the
equal
access
act
had
no
difficulty
deciding
which
clubs
were
extensions
of
the
curriculum
and
those
that
were
not.
in
a...
for
instance,
as
i
stated
earlier,
the
distributive
education
class
is
listed
as
an
extension
of
the
distributive
education
course.
however,
the
chess
club
is
listed
as
a
club
for
students
interested
in
chess,
and
the
interact
is
listed
as
a
club--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
don't
think
you
could
take
it
that--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--your
honor,
i
don't
think--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--your
honor,
number
one,
in
this
particular
class...
club
setting
in
the
class
function
there
is
no
class
in
logic.
there
was
a--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--thee
was
a
mathematics
class,
but
that...
the
chess
club,
for
instance,
was
exactly
what
congress
was...
one
of
the
clubs
frequently
discussed
in
reviewing
the
act,
the
history
of
the
act,
that
would
trigger
the
existence
of
a
noncurriculum
club,
therefore
the
limited
open
forum
under
the
act.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
would
defer
to
congress
on
that,
and
i
would
say
that
in
that
particular
situation
since
the
chess
club
did
come
up
fairly
frequently
in
the
debates
going
back
and
forth,
that
that
would
trigger
the
act.
if
we
look
at
one--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--no,
they're
not.
i
would...
i
know
i
would
not
say
that
they
were
directly
related
to
the
math
curriculum.
that's
in
fact
the
opposite
of
what
i
would
say,
that
the
chess
club
is
the...
one
of
the
main
bases
upon
which
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
uses
the
example
triggering
noncurriculum
related
at
this
particular
school.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
would
think
so
because
even
if
the
math
professor
would
disagree,
i
think...
i
believe
that
that
would
still
present
the
same
problem,
and
that
is
if,
in
fact,
we
take
a
posture...
if
this
court
were
to
take
a
posture
that
anything
related
to
the
missions
and
goals,
which
is
what
the
district
court
stated,
which
the
eighth
circuit
rejected
entirely,
would
circumvent
the
act.
the
act
would
become
a
nullity
really
by
administrative
fiat,
if
you
will.
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
that's
correct,
your
honor,
the
act
does
not.
but
what
the
act
does
show
is
that...
and
in
fact
i
think
you
can
even
draw
an
analogy
to
the
directly
related
test--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--no,
your
honor,
absolutely
not.
what
i'm
saying
is
this,
and
let
me
do
this
by
example.
for
instance--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i've
heard
that.
[laughter]
there
are
other
members
of
the
court
that
don't,
as
well.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
oh,
you
have?
[laughter]
our
position
would
be,
your
honor,
that
the
best
way
to
take
a
look
at
it
was
one
of
the
examples
that
the
court
addressed
to
the
petitioners
in
the...
during
their
argument,
and
that
is,
what
if
there's
no
french
class,
but
there
is
a
french
club?
here...
especially,
no
form
of
french,
or
any
type
of
foreign
activities.
what
congress
meant
by
curriculum
related
in
that
context,
and
why
i
do
use
the
term,
"directly
related
to
curriculum"
is,
when
you
have
the
situation
where
you've
got
a
french
class
and
a
french
club,
or
latin
class
and
a
latin
club,
but
you
cannot...
i
think
the
line
is
easy
to
draw,
your
honor,
or
not
impossible
to
draw,
when
you
have
a
situation
where
the
school
administrators
acknowledge
and
admit
that
a
pure
advocate
club
exists
and
they
state
on
the
record
it
does
not
relate
to
curriculum.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
your
honor,
that
that
would
be
a
part
of
the
school's
curriculum,
that
credit
would
be
given.
i'm
not--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes.
in
that
type
of
situation,
i
think
then
you
have...
that
argument
could
be
made.
what
we
have
in
this
particular
case
is
a
whole
listing
of
clubs
that
do
not
address
the
directly
related,
or
even
come
close
to
it.
for
instance,
in
addition
to
the
peer
advocates,
which
is
acknowledged
not
to
be
related
to
curriculum
by
the
principal
himself,
we
have
the
interact
club,
which
is
an
affiliate
of
rotary
international,
and
there
isn't
a
view
being
espoused
there,
and
that
club...
the
school's
only
basis
to
tie
that
into
curriculum
related
would
be
in
fact
whether
there
was
an
overall
interest
in
the
missions
and
goals
of
the
particular
school--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--well,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
response,
your
honor,
was
twofold.
number
one,
that
the
definition
of
noncurriculum
related
that
the
district
court
approved
and
that
the
school
utilized
totally
circumvents
the
act.
now,
there
is
not
a
great
deal
of
discussion
in
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion
with
regard
to
the
various
tests.
they
did
state
that
there
was
a
chess
club--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--well,
they
stated
that
the
chess
club,
for
instance,
was
not
related
to
curriculum
as
well
as
other
clubs,
and
they
did
not
spell
out
what
those
other
clubs
were.
so
that's
clear,
but
as
i
was
saying--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
they,
in
effect,
applied
more
of
the
directly-related
test
because
of
their
statements
with
regard
to
chess
club
and
as
it
related
to
the
logic
situation
in
the
district
court.
for
instance,
the
judge...
judge
beam
stated
that
the
logic
club
would...
be
a
growth
out
of
the
math
club,
but
there
is
no
direct
tie-in.
the
logic
club,
for
instance,
doesn't
even
really
function
in
that
fashion,
and
i
think
what
the
district
court...
or
the
court
of
appeals
was
concerned
with
was
the
administrative
deference
that
was
being
paid
to
the
school
officials
in
their
interpretation
of
what,
in
fact,
curriculum
related
meant.
that
the
equal
access
act,
if
you
will,
becomes
a
nullity.
that
anything
that's
related
to
missions
and
goals,
which
was
the
test
that
was
decided
by
judge
beam
in
the
lower
court.
and
i
think
the
eighth
circuit
specifically,
albeit
not
as
detailed
as
we
would
like,
rejected
that
proposal
by
stating
that
the
chess
club,
as
well
as
other
curriculum
clubs,
were
in
fact
not
related
to
curriculum
and
therefore
the
equal
access
act
would
have
applied.
and
in
the
context
of
this
particular
forum,
with
the
30
other
clubs
there's
a...
and
again,
in
the
joint
appendix,
if
we're
looking
for
the
test,
the
school
officials
had
no
trouble
in
doing...
in
implementing
the
test
in
this
context.
their
own
listing
of
clubs
does
state,
for
instance,
that
the
band
club
is
a
part
of
the
curriculum
of
band.
so
these
types
of
delineations
are
made
all
the
times.
what
we're
saying
is
that
educators
and
school
officials
should
be
given
deference
with
regard
to
setting
forth
what
their
curriculum
is,
but
if
in
fact
they're
going
to
allow
student-initiated
clubs,
which
this
club
does...
the
school
does,
that
they,
then,
if
a
noncurriculum-related
club
does
exist,
they
in
fact
have
to
open
that
forum
up
under
the
act.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
your
honor,
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
may
i
respond?
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
thank
you,
chief
justice.
in
that
particular
situation,
i
think
it
would
have
to
go
beyond
just
expending
resources.
there
would
have
to
be
something
more
where
there
was
instruction
going
on,
or
else
in
fact
it
would
just
not
be
more
than,
if
you
will,
another
club.
that
there
would
have
to
be
something
during
the
curriculum
where
academic
credit
was
given,
supervision
of
a
teacher
and
these
types
of
things.
thank
you,
your
honor.
