mr.
allen
e.
daubman
this
case
presents
issues
central
to
the
operation
of
co-curricular
activities
in
the
public
secondary
schools
in
this
country.
of
critical
importance
in
that
regard,
obviously,
is
the
equal
access
act,
which
was
enacted
by
congress
in
the
fall
of
1984.
the
act
basically
provides
that
a
school
which
conducts,
or
has
a
limited
open
forum,
may
not
deny
access
to
that
forum
on
the
basis
of
the
political,
philosophical
or
religious
content
of
speech.
in
that
regard,
the
congress
defined
"limited
open
forum"
to
mean
when
a
school
district
grants
an
opportunity
for
one
or
more
noncurriculum-related
student
groups
to
meet
on
school
premises
during
noninstructional
time.
it
is
that
statutory
framework
which
causes
difficulty
in
school
districts
in
trying
to
comply
with
the
act
and
meet
their
educational
obligations.
the
equal
access
act,
as
we
see
it,
basically
balances
three
concerns:
certainly
the
free
speech
rights
of
students
in
our
public
schools;
certainly
also
it
balances
a
concern
of
nonestablishment
of
religion;
and
certainly
also
it
affords
deference
to
school
officials,
affords
them
the
autonomy
and
discretion
to
make
educational
decisions.
in
that
context,
we
urge
the
court
to
interpret
the
act,
interpret
noncurriculum-related,
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
act,
to
encompass
a
situation
which
is
not
found
at
westside
high
school.
all
of
the
student
clubs
and
organizations
at
westside
high
school
were
under,
by
school
board
policy,
the
direct
control
and
supervision
of
the
administration
and
shall
have
a
faculty
sponsor.
the
record
is
replete
with
testimony
that
the
school
officials
maintained
an
active
role
in
practice,
in
determining
the
goals
and
objectives
of
student
clubs
and
organizations
and
the
manner
in
which
those
clubs
and
organizations
operated
in
their
school.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
the
act
basically
provides
that
a
school
district
that
has
a
safe
harbor
provision,
which
basically
provides
that
a
school
district
does
not
have
to
provide
a
faculty
sponsor,
but
if
it
does
so
in
terms
of
a
role
of
a
monitor,
that
that
is
permitted
under
the
act.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
yes.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
that
is
correct.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
the
sponsor
for
the
scuba
club,
in
our
particular
case
there
were
really...
there
was
a
faculty
sponsor
that
was
subject
to
the
direction
of
the
administration.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
what...
the
problem
presented
is
that
we
did
not
have
a
forum
at
the
high
school
and
therefore
not
a
forum
under
the
equal
access
act
which
provided
for
custodial
sponsors,
but
rather
provided
for
active
participation.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
the
district
court
found
otherwise.
the
court
below
reversed
that--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--that's
correct.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
and
in
that
regard--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
but
what
our
school
district
does
have...
what
our
high
school
does
have
is
an
extensive
physical
education
curriculum,
mandated
at
least
in
part
by
state
educational
guidelines
and
the
school
district
felt
that
the
scuba
diving
club,
called
subsurfers
in
our
school,
was
certainly
related
to
that...
the
regular
curriculum
offerings,
to
no
lesser
extent,
other
than
the
degree
of
participation,
than
other
athletic
endeavors
that
are
maintained
as
co-curricular
activities,
whether
that
be
organized
sports
teams
or
intramural
competition...
all
of
those
activities.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
that's
not
entirely
correct.
the...
if
there
were
no
physical
education
classes
at
the
school
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
that
that
was
one
of
the
educational
objectives
of
the
school,
and
therefore
the
scuba
diving
club
related
to
that.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--it
would
not--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--under
my
view,
it
would
not
bring
the
act
into
play.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
the
absence
of
a
french
class
does
not
mean
the
absence
of
foreign
language
department.
there
are
many
education--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--if
the
club's
object...
goals
and
objectives
were
instruction
or
discourse
regarding
the
french
language,
then
i
would
agree
with
you.
if
it
was
to...
if
the
goals
and
objectives
of
that
club,
as
developed
through
the
faculty
sponsor
and
the
administration,
dealt
with
french
culture
or
french
history,
then
there
would
be,
i
think,
quite
a
strong
relationship
to
the
european
studies
programs.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
well,
the
name
of
the
club,
or
the
activity,
is
peer
advocates.
first
of
all,
that
was
something
that
was
initiated
by
a
teacher
as
opposed
by
a
student
and
would
therefore
fall
outside
the
act.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
because
the
act
talks
about
clubs
that
are
student
initiated.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
it...
what
it
says
is
that
the
act
provides
that
student...
that
it
applies
to
student
initiated
clubs.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
quite
apart
from
that,
with
respect
to
peer
advocates,
the
situation
presented
there...
two
points:
first
of
all,
that
was...
purposes
of
the
pretrial
stipulation,
in
terms
of
what
clubs
were
going
to
be
determined
to
be
at
issue
as
to
whether
they
were
noncurriculum-related
for
purposes
this...
of
this
lawsuit,
was
raised
for
the
first
time
on
appeal
in
the
briefs.
it
was
not
something
that
was
tried
to
the
trial
court
and
i
don't
believe
it
was
even
argued
in
the
eighth
circuit,
but
discussed
for
the
first
time
in
briefs
on
appeal
here.
therefore
we
did
not
have
any
opportunity,
certainly,
at
trial
or
otherwise,
to
respond
to
that.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
yes,
it
is,
and
logical
thought
processes
that
are
associated
with
that.
the
history
of
the
chess
club
at
the
high
school,
as
shown
by
the
record
in
this
case,
was
something
that
was
conducted
in
the
math...
before
it
was
a
club,
was
conducted
in
the
math
resource
room
at
the
urging,
and
being
allowed
by
the
head
of
the
math
department
because
of
his
feeling
that
it...
those
who
participated
actively
in
chess
became,
and
continue
to
be,
better
math
students.
in
the
math
resource
room
that
became
disruptive,
and
for
that
reason
it
was
relegated
to
a
club
situation--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--what
we
are
bound
by
is
the
record
presented
in
this
case.
in
terms
of
our
factual
record,
that
was
undisputed.
the
testimony--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--ultimately,
it
is
what
this
court
thinks,
sir.
[laughter]
but
with
respect
to--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--i
think
the...
i
think
it
is
a
factual
determination.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
xx
eighth
circuit--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
we've
urged
that
point.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
i'm
sorry?
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
i
am
arguing
that.
[laughter]
what
we
have
is
the
eighth
circuit--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--what
the
equal
access
act
provided,
quite
clearly,
is
that
there
was
a
broad
discretion
granted
to
school
officials.
the
legislative
history
is...
is
full
of
references
to
that.
congress
did
not
choose
to
define
what
constitutes
noncurriculum-related.
to
do
so
would
be
tantamount
to
establishing
a
national
definition
of
curriculum.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
yes,
it
is.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
well,
certainly
the
district
court
judge
knows
more
about
what's
going
on
and
what's
curriculum
related
in
omaha
than
the
eighth
circuit
does.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
at
the
trial
level?
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
yes,
and
those
were
not
really
discussed
in
the
eighth
circuit
opinion.
the
eighth
circuit
basically
looked
at
some
references
in
the
legislative
history,
saw
a
chess
club
as
in
one
part
of
the
legislative
history
being
characterized
by
one
senator
as
noncurriculum
related--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--at
the
trial
level,
yes.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
yes,
it
was.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
that
is
correct.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
that's
right.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
that's
correct.
what
the
equal
access
act
does,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
is
balance
those
three
concerns.
it
is
very
difficult
for
certainly
this
court
and
much
more
certainly
for
school
officials
to
determine
on
a
case-by-case
basis
how
close
a
relationship
one
needs
for
a
particular
club
activity
as
it
relates
to
one
or
more
particular
regular
courses
that
are
offered
by
the
school.
what
was
done
in
this
case,
or
what
our
practice
had
been
at
westside
high
school
for
several
years
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
equal
access
act,
was
to
treat
and
run
the
co-curricular
student
clubs
as
part
of
the
educational
program
of
the
school.
that
is
to
be,
i
think,
very
clearly
distinguished
from
the
type
of
club
activities
which
were
permitted
in
widmar
v.
vincent.
their
access
to
school
facilities
for
purposes
of
student
meetings
was
allowed,
but
at
no
time
did
the
university
in
that
case
exercise
control
over
those
student
clubs
and
activities.
our
high
school
setting
is
much
different.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
what
the
act
does
is
provides
a
definitional
framework
for
when
you
have
a
limited
open
forum
triggering
the
applicability
of
that
act,
and
it
is
our
contention
that
we
did
not
have
a
limited
open
forum
under
the
terms
of
that
act.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
primarily
because
we
had...
we
did
not
have
noncurriculum-related
student
groups.
the
fact
of
a
faculty
sponsor
and
the
control
exercised
by
that
sponsor,
as
well
as
the
supervision
of
that
sponsor
and
the
answering
to,
by
that
sponsor,
to
the
administration,
i
think
clearly
shows
that
we
did
not
have
a
situation
where
simple
access
to
building
premises
was
allowed,
but
rather
there
was
active
sponsorship
and
involvement
by
the
school
district.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
what
we
are
urging
is
that
the
definition
of
curriculum-relatedness
really
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
the
school
officials
have
chosen
to
do
with
the
co-curricular
activities.
they
have
chosen
to
treat
that
as
part
of
their
curricular
offerings
of
the
school,
part
of
the
educational
program
offered
by
the
school.
the
equal
access
act
i
don't
think
goes
that
far.
i
don't
think
it
touches
that
far.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
i
think
that
certainly
that
risk
is
present.
you
have
a
situation--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--i
think
congress
intended...
i
know
congress
intended
that
what
ought
to
be
done
in
terms
of
the
school
district's
response
to
the
equal
access
act
is
to
allow
school
districts
in
their
discretion
to
make
educational
decisions
as
to
what
academic
and
co-curricular
programs
they're
going
to
sponsor.
if
a
school
district
were
to
just
blatantly
say
no,
everything
we
do
here
is
curriculum
related,
therefore
the
act
doesn't
apply,
i
think
our
trial
courts
are
well
able
to
see
a
sham
when
one
exists.
our
trial
court
in
this
particular
case
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
exploring
that
issue,
and
there
was
a
great
deal
of
testimony
regarding
the
curricular
nature--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--the
eighth
circuit
disagreed
with
the
trial
court
in
interpretation
of
the
equal
access
act.
it
did
not
have
any
detail
on
its
opinion
as
to
a
discussion
of
what
constitutes
curriculum
related
or
not.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
it
gave
no
guidance.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
i
think
the
test
is--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--the
test,
i
think...
and
again,
balancing...
keeping
in
mind
the
three
concerns
that
the
equal
access
act
addressed:
free
speech
rights,
nonestablishment
of
religion
and
school
district
discretion,
the
correct,
and
i
think
most
proper
way
to
interpret
the
act
to
satisfy
those
three
concerns,
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
co-curricular
activity
student
clubs,
whatever
you
want
to
call
them,
do
in
fact
relate
to
the
curriculum
of
the
high
school
and
the
school
district
officials--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--in
fact,
and
if
school
district
officials,
in
doing...
in
structuring
their
co-curricular
activities
in
student
clubs,
treat
it
truly
as
co-curricular,
treat
it
truly
as
part
of
the
educational
program
that
it
offers,
as
the
trial
court
found--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--in
fact.
a
nonsham.
not,
as
suggested
earlier--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--one
of
the
other
basic
educational
choices
that
westside
community
schools
made,
again
long
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
equal
access
act--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--again,
we
don't...
keeping
in
mind
we
don't
have
adversary
clubs.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
no.
the
clubs...
political
clubs
that
you
mentioned--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--sure,
and
it's
those
adversarial
types
of
clubs--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--well,
if
the
chess
club
is--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--that's
correct.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
it
depends
on
the
curriculum
or
the...
what
the
school
district'
done.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
well,
and
that's
what
congress
did.
congress...
curriculum
for
one
school
district
is
not
the
same
for
another
school
district.
it's
not
the
same
today
as
it
is
ten
years
from
now.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
that
is
correct.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
no.
i--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--well,
i
wouldn't
phrase
it
that
way,
obviously.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
well,
and
i
think
as
pointed
out
in
the
briefs
of
the
respondent
and
the
government,
the
dictionaries
do
it
that
way,
too,
but
the
testimony
at
trial,
from
the
students'
own
expert
witness,
defines
"curriculum"
in
the
same
manner
that
was
defined
by,
or
used
by
our
administration,
long
before
passage
of
the
act.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
no.
i'm...
that
isn't...
if
i
said
that,
it
isn't
what
i
meant.
what...
what
we
have
is,
if
you
have
a...
excuse
me...
if
you
have
a
club
system...
you
know,
co-curricular
clubs
that
do
have...
that
are
noncurriculum
related
under
the
act,
then
certainly
the
governmental
clubs
that
was...
that
were
mentioned
earlier
would
fall
under
the
terms
of
the
act,
and
they
would
have
to
be
allowed
as
well.
in
our
school
district
we
do
not
have
adversarial
clubs.
one
of
the
things
testified
to
at
trial
and,
in
practice,
was
in
existence
again
long
before
the
passage
of
the
act
is
that
adversarial
clubs
that
advocate
a
particular
point
of
view
are
not
allowed
in
the
school.
the
school
district
did
not...
does
not...
lend
its
name
to
advocating
a
particular
view.
not
that
controversial
subjects
are
shied
away
from,
by
any
means.
it's
just
that
they
are
dealt
with--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--the
problem
there
is,
again,
that
those
clubs
are
expressing
a
particular
point
of
view.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
it's
a
limiting
factor
in
terms
of
the
operation
of
our
club
structure
is
all
i'm
saying.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
the
position
being?
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
i've
not
abandoned
that
argument,
your
honor,
but
that,
representative
goodling's
test,
if
you
will,
as
well
as
other
things
suggested
in
the
legislative
history--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--it
does.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.

the
test
proposed
by
the
respondents
and
by
the
government
is
contrary
to
the
act
and
is
educationally
unworkable.
to
suggest
that
having
students
work
with
the
handicapped
at
school,
our
regular
ed
students,
so
they
can
learn
to
be
sensitive
to
the
handicapped
to
characterize
that
as
noncurriculum
related,
but
to
say
that
a
football
team,
even
in
the
absence
of
a
physical
education
program
at
the
high
school
is
curriculum
related
creates
unworkable
and--
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
--that's
correct.
mr.
allen
e.
daubman
again,
the
act
isn't
triggered
unless
we
have
noncurriculum
related.
what
the
school
has
chosen
to
do
is
in
structuring
their
co-curricular
activities
is
those
groups
that
advocate
a
particular
point
of
view
are
not
included
in
the
curricular
or
co-curricular
activities
of
the
school.
and
that
was
not
the
case
with
the
club
that
was
requested
in
this
case.
another
example
of
the
unworkability
of
the
test
advocated
by
the
other
side,
photography
club,
which
was
identified
as
a
suspect
club
in
this
case
was
alternatively
taught.
photography
was,
as
a
club
or
as
a
class,
depending
upon
the
availability
of
a
state-certified
teacher
who
could
teach
photography.
to
suggest
that
we
cannot
have...
that
we
create
a
limited
open
forum
by
having
a
photography
club
when
a
state-certified
teacher
is
unavailable
to
teach
it
as
a
regular
class
i
think
presents
an
unworkable
problem,
a
dilemma
that
school
districts
would
not
be
able
to
work
with.
service
clubs
also
indicated
by
the
legislative
history
to
perhaps
in
some
circumstances
be
noncurriculum
related.
in
our
school
district
the
record
is
clear
that
service
clubs
in
many
of
those...
in
the
sociology
class
activities
with
service
clubs
could
constitute...
in
some
cases
required
over
the
years,
in
other
cases
could
be
used
as
extra
credit
in
some
of
the
sociology
classes.
again,
to
say
that
a
particular
type
of
club
is
noncurriculum
related
for
all
purposes
i
think
really
stifles
the
efforts
of
educators
to
deal
with
curriculum
issues
as
they're
constantly
being
called
upon
to
do,
in
structuring
a
program
that
is
relevant
and
provides
educational
benefit
to
its
students.
thank
you,
your
honor.
