you're
arguing
now,
mr.
daubman,
that
the
high
school
did
not
have
a
limited
open
forum,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
are
you
asking
us
to
construe
the
equal
access
act
to
reach
that
conclusion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
would
certainly...
that
would
certainly...
your
construction
would
certainly
enable
any
school
district
that
felt
like
it
to
totally
avoid
the
equal
access
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that's
what
congress
intended?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
eighth
circuit
disagreed
with
the
trial
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
your
view,
mr.
daubman,
supposing
that
a
school,
perhaps
not
westside,
but
some
similar
school,
said
we're
going
to
have
republican
and
democratic
clubs
as
extensions
of
the
curriculum,
as
extensions
of
the
civics
class.
now,
if
that
were
upheld,
that
wouldn't
give
way
to
any
other
noncurricular
clubs,
would
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
should
that
be
a
limiting
factor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
daubman.
mr.
sekulow?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
agree
that
could
be
done
under
the
equal
access
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
school
board--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
school
board
say...
say
why
they
would
close
down
the
clubs
if
this
case
went
against
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
were
these
discussions
held
about,
you
know,
abortion,
homosexuality?
is
that
in
class?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sekulow.
general
starr,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
starr,
is
the
authority
of
congress
in
this
case
derived
from
its
control
over
funds?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
mr.
daubman,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
daubman.
the
case
is
submitted.
