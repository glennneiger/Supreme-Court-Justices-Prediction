o'connor
well,
mr.
daubman,
is
there
some
provision
in
the
federal
act
that
at
least
with
regard
to
clubs
covered
by
the
act
would
limit
the
participation
of
the
faculty
sponsor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
goes
further
and
says
the
sponsor
will
act
as
no
more
than
a
custodian,
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
the
faculty
sponsor
will
not
be
active?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
suppose
the
act
would
be
applied
so
as
to
limit
the
participation
of
the
sponsor
for
the
scuba
class,
for
example...
the
scuba
club?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
just
asking
whether
the
federal
act
would
apply
across
the
board
to
all
clubs
covered
by
the
act,
whether
they
are
religious
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that
the
type
of
participation
you've
been
describing
would
not
be
permitted
under
the
federal
act
by
the
faculty
sponsor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
the
court
below
found
that
you
did
have
a
forum.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we're
talking
about
the
present
situation.
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
does
the
school
have
classes
in
the
regularly
offered
courses
for
credit
in
scuba
and
in
chess?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
subject
has
to
be
taught
in
a
regular
class,
in
essence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
in
the
math
class
some
time
were
devoted
to
teaching
chess,
then
it's
curriculum
related?
