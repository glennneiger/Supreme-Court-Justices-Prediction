justice
stevens
may
i
stop
you
there.
why
is
it
limited
to
that?
you
said
it's
a
derivative
liability.
it
arises
because
the
insurance
company
has
issued
a
policy
to
somebody
who
would
otherwise
be
liable.
why
doesn't
that
apply
equally
in
workmen's
compensation
or
fire
insurance
or
automobile
insurance?
why
limit
it
to
negligence
cases?
justice
stevens
you...
you
would
apply
it
to
a
fire
insurance
policy?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
so,
it's
insurance
that
insures
the
insured
against
liability
to
an
approximate
point--
justice
stevens
--which
is
exactly
what
workmen's
compensation
is.
justice
stevens
well,
would
you
agree
that
in
most
states
if
the...
if
the
employee
had
the
option
between
suing
the
employer
or
the
insurance
company,
it
would
be
a
direct
action?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
stevens
well,
then,
why
does
it
stop
being
a
direction
action
because
it's
the
legislature
of
texas
rather
than
the
plaintiff
who
makes
the
decision
that
you
shall
always
sue
the
insurance
company?
justice
stevens
is
that
true
if...
if
the
insurance
policy
had
lapsed
or
if,
in
fact,
there
was
no
insurance
or
sometimes
the
insurer...
is
the
employer
scot-free
then?
justice
stevens
but
he
has
no
liability
under
the
texas
workmens'
compensation
statute
if
he
fails
to
insure?
justice
stevens
but
supposing
he's
not
negligent?
because
workmens'
compensation
applies
even
in
the
absence
of
negligence.
then
it
would
be
wise.
of
course,
he...
he...
i
suppose
the
employer
would
risk
criminal
responsibilities
or
something
like
that.
but
to
just
falsely
represent
that
they
have
insurance
coverage--
justice
stevens
--i
see.
justice
stevens
and
for
that
reason
it's
not
a
direct
action?
justice
stevens
what
kind
of
an
action
is
it?
justice
stevens
it's
not
an
indirect
action,
is
it?
justice
stevens
you
don't
know
what
kind
of
an
action
it
is.
it
is
not
indirect,
and
it's
not
direct.
it's
something
else.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
jung,
in
the
area
of
negligence
insurance
coverage
and
the
like,
are
there
cases
resolving
this
by
or
against
question
where
an
insurance
company
might
have
brought
suit
against
the
prospective
plaintiff
and
the
insured
to
determine
whether
there
was
coverage
or
something
like
that?
justice
stevens
did
they
say
it
was
not
a
direct
action
or
it
wasn't
by
the
insurance
company?
justice
stevens
yeah,
i
understand.
justice
stevens
well,
of
course,
congress
decided
that
wasn't
all
that
important
in
negligence
cases.
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
saying...
i'm
talking
about
the--
justice
stevens
--where
the
direct
action
statute
clearly
applies.
they
decided
that
the
prejudice
to
the
fact
that
the
insurance
company
was
out
of
state
wasn't
sufficient
to
justify
federal
jurisdiction.
justice
stevens
and
they
thought
this
was
not
the
kind
of
litigation
that
belongs...
that
belongs
in
federal
court.
justice
stevens
of
course,
in
these
cases,
i
suppose,
the
prejudice
against
the
insurance
company
is
not
to
much
because
it's
out
of
state.
it's
because
it
is
an
insurance
company.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask?
you
said
earlier
about
the
rights
of
the
employee.
as
i
understand
from
your
opponent,
the
employer...
it's
really
entirely
up
to
the
employer
whether
there
shall
be
coverage
for
the
employee
because
the
employer
is
totally
free
to
just
not
buy
any
insurance
and
just,
in
effect,
opt
out
of
the
program
completely.
justice
stevens
so,
the
employee
really
has
no
right
to
be
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
yeah.
mr.
fults,
i
don't
understand
what
your
point
is.
is
your
point
that
this
statute
covers
only
workmen's
compensation
cases
and
all
workmen's
compensation
cases?
is
that
your
point?
justice
stevens
well,
maybe
the
employee
does
have
that
right
because
if
it's
not...
if,
taking
justice
kennedy's
point,
if
it's
not
a
contract
of
liability
of
insurance,
then
the
proviso
doesn't
apply,
and
they
could
just
go
on
in
federal
court.
justice
stevens
the
sixth
circuit
relied
on
the
by
language,
by
or
against
point,
and
the
direct
action
point.
justice
stevens
but
not
on
the...
what
the
words
liability
insurance
mean.
justice
stevens
of
course,
i
suppose
if
we
agree
with
your
opponent
on
the
ultimate
outcome,
i
suppose
we
could
straighten
that
out,
couldn't
we,
and
open
the
door
to
both.
say
that...
in
other
words,
if
we
bought
his
third
argument...
he
didn't
really
press
it
in
oral
argument,
the
one
justice
kennedy's
referring
to...
that
would
eliminate
the
disparity
in
the
opportunity
to
get
in
federal
court.
justice
stevens
federal
judges
will
have
more
business,
too.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
sixth
circuit
case
which
i
frankly
haven't
read
yet.
does
the...
what
state
statute
was
involved
in
that
case?
justice
stevens
does
tennessee
have
the
same
peculiarities
as
the
texas
statute?
justice
stevens
for
example,
in
tennessee
would
the
employer
be
liable?
justice
stevens
to
the
extent
there
are
differences
between
the
two
states,
you
would
have
thought
the
sixth
circuit
might
have
decided
the
way
the
fifth
did
and
vice
versa,
isn't
that
right,
that
the...
the...
under
that
statute
there's
a
stronger
case
for
the...
for
your
side
of
it,
your
side
of
the
case.
justice
stevens
see,
it
would
seem
in
that
case
you
would
pretty
clearly
have
had
a
direct
action,
but
maybe
you
don't.
maybe
it
wasn't
by
the
right
party.
does
anyone
ever
argue
that
the
action
really
commences
when
the
employee
files
the
claim,
and
at
that
stage
it's
an
action
against
the
insurance
company...
it's
just
a
continuation
of
that
action?
justice
stevens
mr.
jung,
lots
of
your...
a
major
part
of
your
argument
really
is
unique
to
texas,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
so,
if
we...
we
could
agree
with
you
without
resolving
the
conflict,
couldn't
we?
justice
stevens
it
certainly
was
no
part
of
the
justification
for
the
sixth
circuit's
decision,
which
we
thought...
with
which
we
thought
there
was
a
conflict?
justice
stevens
not
important
enough
for
the
fifth
circuit,
but
important
enough
for
us?
