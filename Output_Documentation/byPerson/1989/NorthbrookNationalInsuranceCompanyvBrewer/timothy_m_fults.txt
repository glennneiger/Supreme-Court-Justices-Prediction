mr.
timothy
m.
fults
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
for
determination
before
the
court
today
is
one
of
construction
and
one
of
interpretation...
construction
and
interpretation,
of
course,
of
the
direction
action
proviso
to
section
1332.
it
is
the
respondents'
contention
that
fifth
circuit's
construction
of
that
proviso
in
the
campbell
case
is
right
and
that
the
sixth
circuit's
construction
of
that
proviso
in
the
greene
case
is
wrong.
the
campbell
decision
does
two
things
or
is
two
things.
it
is
consistent
with
the
underlying
congressional
intent
regarding
workers'
compensation
matters
in
general.
the
second
thing
that
the
campbell
decision
does
is
move
or
put
in
a
local
forum
an
essentially
local
dispute.
the
decision
in
greene,
on
the
other
hand,
constitutes
an
unwarranted
extension
of
federal
jurisdiction
into
what
is
essentially
a
local
matter,
and
it
creates
the
very
type
of
problems
that
congressional
intent
and
court
decisions
have
tried
to
eliminate
in
the
workers'
compensation
context.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
i
mean
that
it
turns
on
issues
of
local
law,
your
honor,
and
also
that
the
liability
issue
is
one
that
is...
that
is
between
the
individual
and
his
employer.
it
is
a
texas
resident
in
this
case
working
for
a
texas
employer,
hurt
on
a
texas
job.
the
fact
that
the
texas--
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
--employer
was
insured
doesn't
affect
that
basic
liability
issue.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
those
are
the...
there
are
certain
types,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
what
we
have
in
the
workers'
compensation
context
is
a
history
of
legislative
intent
designed
to
take
these
types
of
cases.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
exactly,
your
honor.
senate
reports
1830
to
the
1958
amendment--
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
--there
was
no
effort
to
remove
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
from
the
legislative
history,
your
honor,
in
almost
those
exact
words,
in
senate
report
1830
that
no
federal
question
is
involved.
also,
from
this--
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
--it...
that
is
exactly
what
the
holding
in
horton
was,
your
honor,
because
at
the
time
horton
was
decided
in
1961
we
did
not
have
this
proviso.
we
did
have
the
amendment
to
section
1445
that
eliminated
removal
of
workers'
compensation.
then
we
have
the
horton
case
where
the
court
holds
that
because
section
1445
was
amended
as
it
was,
these
cases
can't
be
removed,
but
we
can't
infer
from
that
they
can't
be
originally
filed
in
federal
court.
i
would
note
that
in
the
horton
case
in
the
dissent
a
very
clear
statement
was
made
that
although
section
1332
doesn't
specifically
prohibit
original
filings
in
federal
court,
a
clearer
expression
of
congressional
dislike
for
saddling
federal
courts
with
such
cases
could
hardly
be
imagined.
that's
the
underlying
thought.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
and
then
after
horton
we
have
the
amendment
to
or
the
direct
action
proviso,
the
amendment
to
section
1332(c).
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
the
board
award,
your
honor,
was
$36,000,
the
board
award
being
the
award
to
mr.
buer...
mr.
brewer
by
the
texas
agency,
the
industrial
accident
board.
it
was
enough
at
the
time.
it
would
not
be
enough
now
for
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
yes,
sir.
it's
instructive--
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
--'64,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
it's
important,
i
believe,
in
analyzing
congressional
intent
in
the
workers'
compensation
context
to
look
a
little
bit
at
the
history.
workers'
compensation
statutes
exist
in
all
50
states.
they
exist
in
the
substantive
body
of
federal
law.
they
are
universally
regarded
as
designed
to
benefit
the
worker.
there's
a
legislative
trade-off.
common
law
rights
are
taken
away.
statutory
rights
are
given.
because
of
that
legislative
trade-off
those
given
statutory
rights
must
be
construed
in
favor
of
the
worker.
this
court
has
held
that
in
united
states
versus
demco
in
1966
the
purpose
of
the
workers'
compensation
statutes
is
to
provide
a
quicker
and
more
certain
remedy
for
the
worker.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
your
honor,
it
does
not
directly
mean--
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
--your
honor,
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
do
think
that
it
is
important
because
of
the
express
congressional
intent
that
a
federal
forum
is
not
an
appropriate
forum
for
a
workers'
compensation
case
for
a
delay.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
it's
a
different
argument,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it
takes
us
to
the
same
place
because
what
we
see,
respondent
contends,
starting
in
1954
with
the
elbert
case,
going
through
the
1958
amendment
to
section
1445,
through
horton
and
through
the
1964
amendment
that
we're
concerned
with
today
is
a
history
of
recognition
that
a
workers'
compensation
case
is
essentially
local
in
character
and
should
be
decided
in
a
local
forum.
otherwise,
what
we
have
is--
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
--we
don't
believe--
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
--no,
your
honor,
and
we
do
not
believe
that
this
case
should
be
here
for
these
reasons.
mr.
brewer
was
injured
in
1986.
a
board
award
was
given
in
1987.
mr.
brewer
is
still
wondering
why
he
has
not
received
his
award.
that
is
not
because
of
any
detriment
or
any
derogation
of
a
federal
forum.
it
is
because
most
states,
such
as
texas,
have
specific
statutes,
such
as
our
section
23-101,
that
give
workers'
compensation
cases
priority.
this
is
in
line
with
the
overall
federal
purpose
in
a
workers'
compensation
case
of
a
quick
and
efficient
remedy
for
the
worker.
we
don't
have
that
in
the
federal
forum.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
i
meant
to
say
an
intent,
a
federal
intent.
we
see
that...
a
congressional
intent
throughout
the
legislative
history.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
the
1964
legislative
history
does
not
mention
workers'
compensation
directly.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
yes,
it
does.
and
we
then
go
further
to
have
the
direct
action
proviso
that
provides
in
a
direct
action
against
an
insurer,
which
we
believe
we
do
have
here--
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
--yes,
sir.
and
that
is...
that
is
the
holding
in
the
hernandez
case,
that
is
the
holding
in
campbell,
that
is
recognized
even
in
greene,
that
we
have
a
direct
action
and
congress
by...
by
not
expressly
mentioning
a
workers'
compensation
case
did
not
exclude
it.
the
language
in
hernandez
is
obviously
when
they
said
"all
direct
actions",
we
meant
all
direct
actions.
and,
therefore,
workers'
comp
falls
directly
within
that
orbit.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
texas
does
have
a
voluntary
workers'
compensation
system.
their
opting
out
is
not
without
penalty.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
that's
right,
and
some
are
and
some
aren't.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
and
it...
exactly.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
no,
your
honor.
my
point
is
that
it
covers
all
directions
and
that
workers'
compensation
cases
are
such
direct
actions
and,
therefore,
this
proviso
does
cover
this
workers'
compensation
case,
no
matter
who
brings
the
suit.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
i
don't
know
why,
your
honor,
and
the
court
has
obviously
put
its
finger
on
the
weakest
point
of
our
case.
the
language
says
in
a
direct
action
against
an
insurer...
and
if
i
understand
the
court's
question,
it's
how
can
you
stand
there
and
say
against
an
insurer
means
by
an
insurer.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
in
answer
to
that...
and
that
is
at
first
blush,
your
honor,
it
does
seem
difficult
or
impossible
to
reconcile
"by"
with
"against".
this
is
why
i
have
tried
to
stress
the
legislative
intent
behind
the
statute.
my
speculation
is
that
the
contingency
was
probably
not
thought
of
at
the
time.
that
i
don't
think
is
appropriate
to
take
that
approach
in
a
formal
determination.
that's
my
speculation
of
why
it
is.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
in
theory,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that's
true,
and
the
theory
i'm
talking
about
is
the
theory
of
diversity
jurisdiction
that
there
really
would
be
local
prejudice.
i
think
that
congress
has
manifested
and
definitely
manifested
an
intent
that
out-of-state
incorporations...
out-of-state
corporations
are
not
entitled
to
that
benefit
because
in
1954,
section
1445
was
amended
saying
corporation,
you
cannot
remove
this
workers'
compensation
case
to
federal
court.
there
is
the
congressional
intent,
that
it
is
not
a
diversity
theory
situation,
and
that's
the
distinction
that
i
would
make.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
yes,
sir.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
i
think
it
would
be
a
first
policy...
a
first
party
liability
case.
i
think
the
interpretation
that
would
be
appropriate,
your
honor,
is
is
that
taken
really
by
both
greene
in
the
sixth
circuit
and
campbell
in
the
fifth
circuit.
there
is
no
dispute
among
the
circuits
that
workers'
compensation
is
liability
insurance.
the
definition--
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
--the
meaning
cited
by
the
court
is
one
that
indemnifies
against
becoming
liable,
almost
a...
a
self-definition.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
it
does
indemnify
the
employer
against
liability
for
this
action
by
his
employee.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
no,
the
policy...
if
i
follow
the
court
the
policy
does
it
because
it's
required
under
the
state
law.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
that
argument
is
raised...
did
not
raise
an
oral
argument...
has
been
raised
by
the
petitioner
in
his
written
briefs,
of
course.
in
texas
it
is
a
voluntary
workers'
compensation
scheme...
pardon
me.
the
employer
has
the
right
but
not
the
obligation
to
buy
workers'
compensation
insurance.
if
he
buys
that
compensation
insurance,
he
has
purchased
an
indemnity
from
becoming
liable
under
the
definition
that's
been
adopted
by
both
the
fifth
and
sixth
circuits
as
used
in
the
vines
case
cited
by
both.
and
that
is
what
we
believe
would
make
that
a
liability
action.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
no,
because
there
would
be
no
liability
for
those
health
benefits
otherwise.
that's
a
perk.
in
our
situation
the
employer
very
well
could
have
liability
and
would
whether
he's
insured
or
not
for
an
on-the-job
injury
caused
by
his
negligence
because
of
the
texas--
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
--exactly,
and
because
of
the
workers'
compensation
scheme
he
can
insure
with
compensation
insurance
against
that.
again,
i
would
go
to
the
definition
that
the
vines
court
used
it
as
a
policy
that
indemnifies
against
becoming
liable,
and
it
appears
to
me
that
is
exactly
what
we
have.
i
think
that
it's
important
to
note
if
the
grain
rationale
is
adopted
what
we
would
have.
as
the
court
has
already
alluded
to,
we
would
have
a
race
to
the
courthouse
situation.
we
would
have
a
situation
where
an
insurance
carrier
has
the
right,
has
the
luxury
of
picking
his
forum,
federal
or
state,
but
the
unhappy
employee,
the
unhappy
worker,
as
the
campbell
court
put
it,
does
not
have
that
luxury.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
that
would
be
possible
with
an
amendment
of
section
1332(c).
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
if
that
were...
if
that
were
the
case,
your
honor,
it
could.
the
fact
of
the
matter
in
a
practical
sense
is
that
both
the
fifth
and
the
sixth
circuits
have
expressly
held
that
this
type
of
workers'
comp
situation
is
a
liability
insurance
situation.
so,
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
--correct.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
correct.
the
hernandez
case,
not
the
campbell
case.
hernandez
also
in
the
fifth
circuit
expressly
talks
about
it
being
a
liability
insurance
case.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
what
it
would
also
do,
your
honor,
that
i
think
is
more--
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
--it
would
give
judges
a
lot
more
business.
and
that
has
been
the
underlying
concern
both...
in
both
sets
of
legislative
history,
if
you
will,
is
not
to
clog
the
federal
dockets
with
cases
that
are
recognized
to
be
essentially
local
in
character.
we
have...
the
industrial
accident
board
in
texas
publishes
an
annual
report.
the
annual
report
gives
statistical
data
on
the
number
of
cases
involved.
the
most
recent
annual
report
of
the
texas
administrative
agency
puts
7,800...
actually
7,872
cases
currently
in
the
state
courts.
these
are
cases
that
would
arguably
fall
over
to
the
federal
courts
if
the
sixth
circuit
analysis
applied.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
yes,
your
honor,
you
do
now.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
the
data
is
not
compiled
in
that
fashion.
i
would
doubt
really
and
truly
that
most
fall
within
that
category.
but,
i
think
we
would
run
into
a
very
significant
problem
with
the
horton
case
if
we
were
in
this
position.
horton
was
a
$1,400
award
by
the
board.
total
and
permanent
injury
is
the
highest
category
of
injury
that...
in
this
workers'
compensation
scheme.
the
court
held
in
horton
that
even
though
the
insurance
company
went
to
court
on
a
$1,400
claim,
it
was
possible
that
the
counterclaim
for
benefits
would
come
in
being
$14,000
over
the
jurisdictional
amount.
that
was
a
5
to
4
decision,
and
that
was
a
very...
that...
that
was
the
main
point
of
the
dissent
is
that
should
not
be
that
way.
that's
the
situation
we
would
find
ourself
in,
however,
under
the
court's
analogy.
we
would
have
a
race
to
the
courthouse.
we
would
have
the
problem
that
has
already
been
noted
of
a
substantially
crowded
federal
docket
becoming
even
worse.
we
would
also
have
a
delay
in
the
resolution
of
claims
which
is
directly
contrary
to
the
universally
accepted
policy
underlying
workers'
compensation
cases.
the
effect
would
be
to
effectively
eliminate
the
use
of
the
texas
statute
that
gives
workers'
compensation
priority.
it
would
be...
it
could
potentially
result
in
a
disparity
of
results,
also
directly
contrary
to
the
underlying
purposes
because
some
courts
would
be
in
state
court...
some
cases
in
state
court,
some
cases
in
federal
court.
for
these
reasons,
in
the
respondents'
view,
an
adoption
of
the
greene
analysis
would
create
the
very
problems
that
we
have
a
15-year
history
of
trying
to
eliminate.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
tennessee.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
there
are
some
similarities.
i
think,
for
the
purpose
of
the
court's
question,
they're
different.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
the
employer...
counsel
are
nodding,
and
i'm
going
to
defer.
in
tennessee
my
understanding
is
that
the
employer
must
be
joined
as
a
party,
whereas
in
texas
you
cannot.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
that
would
be
true.
really,
the
only
basis
for
the
greene
decision
is
the
point
that
petitioner
raises
in
argument
that
this
is
a
case
where
classical
diversity
theory
should
apply.
and,
for
the
reasons
that
i
have
already
talked
about...
that
being
that
congress
has
abandoned
that
intent
in
workers'
comp
situations...
i
believe
that
basis
falls
from
the
greene
case.
what
we're
really
doing,
if
you
will,
is
combining
or
stacking
legal
fiction
on
legal
fiction.
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
yes,
indeed,
your
honor,
and
that
is
one
of
the
bases
of
the
campbell
holding,
that
being
that
this...
the
process
viewed
in
its
entirety
is
really--
mr.
timothy
m.
fults
--a
claim
for
the
worker
to
get
the
benefits
that
he
is
entitled
to.
that's
why
the
campbell
court
said
there's
no
distinction,
really,
in
who
brings
the
case.
that
type
of
analysis
has
been
used
by
this
court
before
in
the
indianapolis
versus
chase
national
bank
case
that
counsel
alluded
to
in
argument.
justice
frankfurter
makes
a
point
of
saying
that
one
party's
preference
for
federal
forum
is
no
reason
to
deny
the
plain
facts
of
the
matter.
the
plain
facts
of
this
matter
are
that
we
are
talking
about
a
worker
injured
on
the
job
who
by
statute
has
been
given
what
is
supposed
to
be
an
economical,
uniform,
expeditious
remedy
that
will
be
denied
to
him
under
the
green
analysis.
for
these
reasons,
your
honor,
we
think
that
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
