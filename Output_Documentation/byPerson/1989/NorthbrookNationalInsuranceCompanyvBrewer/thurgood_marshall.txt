if

justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case,
the
federal
diversity
statute
provides
that
in
a
direct
action
against
a
liability
insurer,
the
insurer
shall
be
deemed
a
citizen
of
the
same
state
as
the
insured
for
purposes
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
today,
we
hold
that
this
proviso
does
not
apply
to
a
texas
workers'
compensation
action
brought
in
federal
court
by
another
state
insurer.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
stevens
has
filed

opinion.
