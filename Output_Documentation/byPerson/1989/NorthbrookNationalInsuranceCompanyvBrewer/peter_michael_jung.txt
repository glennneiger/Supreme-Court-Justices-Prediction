mr.
peter
michael
jung
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
court
is
called
on
to
revisit
an
issue
which
it
last
addressed
in
1961,
the
right
of
workers'
compensation
insurers
to
avail
themselves
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
the
case
involves
questions
of
statutory
interpretation
relating
to
the
direct
action
proviso
of
28
u.s.c.
section
1332(c)
which
deems
an
insurance
company
to
share
the
citizenship
of
its
insured
in
a
direct
action
against
the
insurer
of
a
policy
or
contract
of
liability
insurance.
the
facts
of
the
case
are
extraordinarily
simple.
in
april
of
1986
larry
brewer,
who
was
a
texas
citizen,
allegedly
suffered
a
disabling
on-the-job
injury
while
working
for
whitmire
line
clearance,
incorporated,
which
is
a
texas
corporation.
brewer
filed
a
claim
for
benefits
with
the
texas
industrial
accident
board,
and
in
may
of
1987
that
board
made
an
award
in
brewer's
factor.
pursuant
to
texas
law,
that
award
was
not
against
whitmire
but,
rather,
against
whitmire's
compensation
insurance
carrier,
northbrook
national
insurance
company.
northbrook
is
an
illinois
corporation.
northbrook
chose
to
exercise
its
right
under
texas
law
to
bring
a
suit
to
set
aside
the
board
award,
and
it
brought
that
suit
in
federal
district
court
on
the
basis
of
diversity
of
citizenship
between
itself
and
brewer.
it
did
so
with
full
awareness
of
two
adverse
fifth
circuit
precedents
which
had
applied
the
direct
action
proviso
to
texas
workers'
compensation
suits
where
the
employee
and
the
employee
shared
common
citizenship.
both
the
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
panel
felt
obliged
to
follow
those
precedents,
but
each
court
questioned
their
soundness,
particularly
in
light
of
a
sixth
circuit
precedent
holding
that
workers'
compensation
suits
by
insurers
do
not
fall
within
the
direct
action
proviso.
in
my
argument
today
i
will
first
briefly
address
the
context
and
legislative
history
of
the
direct
action
proviso
and
then
turn
to
the
two
issues
in
this
appeal,
first,
whether
this
is,
indeed,
a
direction
action
on
a
policy
or
contract
of
liability
insurance
and,
second,
whether
an
action
by
an
insurer
rather
than
against
an
insurer
falls
within
the
direct
action
proviso.
as
this
court
is
aware,
in
certain
states...
notably
louisiana
and
wisconsin...
an
injured
party
is
permitted
to
bring
a
direct
action
against
the
tortfeasor...
excuse
me,
against
the
tortfeasor's
liability
insurance
carrier
without
joining
the
tortfeasor
and
without
first
obtaining
a
judgment
against
the
tortfeasor.
in
1954
this
court
not
only
sustained
the
constitutionality
of
such
statutes,
but
also
held
in
lumberman's
mutual
casualty
company
versus
elbert
that
such
suits
could
be
filed
in
federal
court
on
the
basis
of
diversity
of
citizenship
between
the
injured
worker
plaintiff...
injured
emp...
plaintiff...
and
the
insurance
company
defendant.
at
about
that
same
time
attorneys
for
injured
parties
in
the
state
of
louisiana
began
to
disfavor
their
own
state
court
system
due
to
the
unusual
louisiana
appellate
rule
which
permits
free
and
open
reexamination
of
jury
findings
and
verdicts,
and
the
results
of
these
two
phenomena
was
a
massive
increase
in
the
dockets
of
the
federal
courts
in
louisiana.
the
direct
action
proviso
was
the
congressional
response
to
this
situation.
by
deeming
the
out-of-state
insurer
to
share
the
citizenship
of
his
in-state
insured,
the
statute
effectively
eliminated
most
direct
actions
from
the
federal
courts
and
congress--
mr.
peter
michael
jung
--i
regret
to
say
i
do
not
know
that,
your
honor.
i
only
know
what--
mr.
peter
michael
jung
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
legislative
history
suggests
that
you
do
because
congress
was
concerned
about
plaintiffs
choosing
the
federal
courts
so
as
to
avoid
the
reexamination
problem
that
prevailed
in
louisiana
state
courts.
and
congress
in
enacting
the
direct
action
proviso
expressed
concern,
not
only
about
the
dockets
in
louisiana,
but
about
the
fact
that
direct
actions
filed
by
injured
parties
in
the
federal
courts
did
not
fall
within
what
congress
perceived
as
the
spirit
and
intent
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
now,
the
congressional
focus
throughout
the
legislative
history
is
on
suits
by
injured
parties
against
insurance
companies
and
on
the
fact
that
such
plaintiffs,
if
they
come
from
in
state
and
file
their
suit
in
federal
court,
have
no
need
of
the
federal
courts
to
avoid
possible
local
bias.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
had
any
concern
about
the
filing
of
suits
by
insurance
carriers.
likewise,
nothing
indicates
that
congress
specifically
had
workers'
compensation
actions
in
mind
when
it
enacted
the
direct
action
proviso.
it
stated
that
there
were,
at
the
time,
two
states,
louisiana
and
wisconsin,
which
had
direct
action
statutes.
obviously
if
workers'
compensation
suits...
statutes
had
been
regarded
as
direct
action
statutes,
that
statement
could
not
have
been
made.
only
three
years
earlier
this
court
in
the
horton
versus
liberty
mutual
insurance
company
case
had
held
that
notwithstanding
the
withdrawal
of
removal
jurisdiction
over
such
suits,
original
diversity
jurisdiction
over
workers'
compensation
suits
persisted,
and
yet
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
direct
action
proviso
suggests
any
intent
to
tamper
with
or
alter
this
court's
decision
in
horton
or
to
otherwise
affect
workers'
compensation
suits.
the
congressional
purpose
in
enacting
the
direct
action
proviso
is
mirrored
in
the
language
which
congress
chose,
particularly
the
term
direct
action.
the
lower
courts
have
had
considerable
experience
in
distinguishing
between
direct
actions
that
fall
within
the
proviso
and
other
actions
against
insurance
companies
that
do
not.
they
correctly
reasoned
that
direct
action
was
used
by
congress
as
a
term
of
art
to
refer
to
a
suit
against
an
insurance
company
on
a
derivative
liability,
by
which
is
meant
that
the
cause
of
action
asserted
against
the
insurance
company
is
one
which
could
instead
have
been
asserted
against
the...
the
insured.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
it
is
not
necessarily
limited
to
negligence
cases,
justice
stevens.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
no,
your
honor,
because
that
is
not
a
derivative
liability.
fire
insurance
is
two-party
insurance
between
the
injured
person--
mr.
peter
michael
jung
--and
the
insurer.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
to
another
person,
a
third
party.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
which
is
exactly
what
it
is,
your
honor,
in
most
states,
but
not
in
texas
and
some
other
states.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
i
would
stop
just
short
of
agreeing
with
that,
your
honor,
and
would
say
this.
congress
clearly
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
direct
action
proviso
had
in
mind
tort
statutes.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
it
still
takes
the
court
a
little
bit
afield
from
that.
but
analytically
in
states
where
an
employer
is
liable,
analytically
that
is
indistinguishable
from
a
direct
action.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
well,
the
legislature
not
only
decided
that
you
shall
sue
the
insurance
company
directly,
it
decided
that
you
have
no
cause
of
action
against
the
insured
employer--
mr.
peter
michael
jung
--he
is
scot-free
of
liability
for
workers'
compensation
benefits.
he
may
well
be
liable
on
standard
common
law
theories,
but
there
is
not
anywhere
near
a
complete
congruence.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
that
is
correct.
an
employer
in
texas
can
never
be
liable
for
workers'
compensation
benefits
with
the
exception
of
some
very
specific
self-insurance
provisions
which
require
posting
of
bonds
and
so
forth.
apart
from
that,
he
may
be
liable
at
common
law
for
his
own
negligence,
just
as
any
negligent
party.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
well,
for
falsely
representing,
he
would
risk
criminal
liability,
but
in
fact,
workers'
compensation
insurance
is
voluntary
in
texas,
and
an
employer
who
wishes
to
run
the
gauntlet
of
having
common
law
liability
is
not
obligated
to
purchase
workers'
compensation
insurance.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
and
that's
a
fairly
unusual
feature
of
the
texas
scheme.
it's
a
feature
that
we
believe
is
dispositive
of
this
case
in
that
in
texas
workers'
compensation
liability
on
the
insurance
carrier
is
a
primary
liability,
not
a
derivative
liability,
and
the
cause
of
action
asserted
against
the
insurer
for
workers'
compensation
benefits
is
not
a
cause
of
action
which
could
be
asserted
against
the
employer.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
for
that
reason
it
is
not
a
direct
action,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
it's
an
action.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
it
is
not
an
indirect
action,
and
yet
the
courts
have
said
that
any
action
which
is
filed
against
an
insurance
carrier
does
not
merely
because
it
is
filed
directly
against
that
insurance
carrier
qualify
for
the
term
of
art
direct
action.
if
that
had
a
more
specific
meaning
than
that
as
is
reflected
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
context
of
the
statute.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
that's
correct,
and
there
are
many
cases
in
the
lower
courts
where
there
are
suits
on
two-party
insurance,
say,
against
a
fire
insurer
for
failing
to
pay
a
claim,
and
the
courts
have
said
that
is
not
a
direct
action.
it
is
something
else,
and
they
haven't
given
another
label
to
it.
the
statute
applies
by
its
terms
not
to
direct
actions
generally,
but
to
direct
actions
against
insurance
companies,
and
the
fifth
and
sixth
circuits
have
split
on
the
interpretation
of
that
provision
and
the
application
of
it
to
workers'
compensation
suits
filed
by
insurers
rather
than
against
insurers.
the
fifth
circuit
has
reasoned
that
the
entire
workers'
compensation
process
must
be
treated
as
a
claim
by
an
insured
worker
against
an
insurance
carrier
to
recover
money,
and
has
held
in
campbell
versus
insurance
company
of
north
america
that
a
workers'
compensation
suit
by
an
insurance
company
is,
in
fact,
the
same
thing
as
a
workers'
compensation
suit
against
an
insurance
company.
and
the
court
also
reasoned
that
it
would
be
unfair
to
deny
a
federal
forum
to
an
injured
worker,
but
to
afford
that
forum
to
an
insurance
company.
the
sixth
circuit,
on
the
other
hand,
in
aetna
life
and
casualty
company
versus
greene
reasoned
first,
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
direct...
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
direct
action
proviso
to
suggest
its
application
to
suits
by
insurers;
second,
that
indeed,
such
suits
do
fall,
unlike
suits
by
injured
workers,
within
the
spirit
and
purpose
of
diversity
jurisdiction;
and,
finally,
that
it
would
do
unwarranted
violence
to
the
language
used
by
congress
to
say
that
a
suit
brought
by
an
insurance
company
is,
in
fact,
against
the
insurance
company.
and
congress
had
good
reason
to
choose
the
phrase
"against
the
insurance
company"
when
drafting
the
direct
action
proviso.
where
an
injured
worker
files
a
suit,
generally
speaking,
he
is...
files
suit
in
the
state
in
which
he
lives.
and
if
he
chooses
a
federal
court
in
preference
to
his
own
home
state
court,
he
does
so
for
gratuitous
reasons
of
litigation
strategy
unrelated
to
the
purposes
that
the
framers
in
the
original
congress
had
in
mind
in
enacting
diversity
jurisdiction.
direct
actions
brought
by
out-of-state
insurers,
on
the
other
hand,
partake
of
all
the
classical
incidents
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
they
represent
an
attempt
to
avoid
actual
or
perceived
local
bias
in
the
state
courts.
thus,
the
fifth
circuit's
focus
in
campbell
on
the
big
picture
was,
we
submit,
a
blurred
focus.
the
focus
should
not
be
on
who
filed
the
administrative
claim
or
on
who's
seeking
money
from
whom
or
on
who
bears
the
burden
of
proof,
but
it
should
be
on
who
made
the
decision
to
bring
this
dispute
in
a
federal
court
and
on
whether
the
likely
reasons
underlying
that
decision
are
in
accord
or
in
discord
with
the
purposes
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
there
are
indeed,
your
honor,
and
ironically
they're
in
the
fifth
circuit.
and
in
both
of
the
cases,
dairyland
insurance
company
versus
makover
and
evanston
insurance
company
versus
jimco,
the
fifth
circuit
has
limited
campbell
to
its
facts
and
to
the
context
of
workers'
compensation
insurance.
and
in
those
cases
an
insurer
did
what
your
honor
described,
brought
a
reverse
direct
action
in
louisiana
against
the
injured
party/would-be
plaintiff
and
against
its
own
would-be
insured
to
determine
the
coverage
question,
and
the
courts
entertained
the
suit
reasoning
that
that
is
not
a
direct
action.
indeed,
in
the
evanston
case,
the
court
went
so
far
as
to
say,
"the
direct
action
proviso
has
no
applicability
to
suits
by
insurers.
"
mr.
peter
michael
jung
they
went
off
on
by
the
insurance
company--
mr.
peter
michael
jung
--and
they
distinguished...
they
limited
campbell
to
its
facts
is
basically
what
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
said
that
they
had
done.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
i'm
not
aware
of
any
cases
in
the
diversity
context
where
the
party
who
physically
brings
the
suit
and
files
the
complaint
has
been
realigned
as
the
defendant.
we
have
that
in
skelly
oil
in
the
declaratory
judgment
cases
in
federal
question
jurisdiction,
but
that
rests
on
some
different
issues
involving...
arising
under
as
used
by
congress
in
1331.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
in
the
insurance
context
or
otherwise
where
the
party
who
files
the
suit
in
a
diversity
case
has
been
realigned
as
a
defendant.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
well,
i
suppose
that's
theoretically
possible,
justice
kennedy,
but
there
has
been,
as
i've
said...
there've
been
a
lot
of
sorting
out
of
who's
adverse
to
whom.
the
city
of
indianapolis
case
is
a
good
example
of
that,
but
there've
been,
to
my
knowledge,
no
case
where
you...
except...
went
so
far
with
that
as
to
make
the
person
who
filed
the
suit
anything
other
than
a
plaintiff.
you
may
have
made
some
other
co-parties
plaintiff
or
defendant
according
to
their
true
interests,
but
never
has
the
party
who
under
rule
3
commenced
the
case
by
filing
the
complaint
with
the
court
been
construed
to
be
the
party
against
whom
the
case
was
brought.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
your
honor,
unfortunately
at
some
times
in
texas
workers'
compensation
litigation,
there
is
a
race
to
the
courthouse
because
even
in
state
court,
there
can
be
two
different
forums
that
are
available.
there
was
no
race
to
the
courthouse
in
this
case.
mr.
brewer
did
not
file
a
state
court
suit.
unfortunately,
the
direct
action
proviso
makes
a
suit
against
an
insurance
carrier
in
state
court
not
removable
to
federal
court.
and
so
a
in
that
sense,
if
either
party
has
the
option
to
bring
suit
and
if
the
out-of-state
insurer
desires
to
be
in
federal
court,
it's
to
his
advantage
to
file
the
suit
first,
whereas
the
injured
worker
may
have
an
advantage
in
filing
in
state
court
first.
but
that's
a
fairly
unusual
situation
and
it's
not
the
situation
in
this
case.
we
believe
that
the
fifth
circuit's
search
for
symmetry
in
campbell
was
a
search
for
false
symmetry.
the
distinction
between
suits
by
insurers
and
suits
against
insurers
is
rooted
in
the
materially
different
situations
faced
by
the
parties.
the
fifth
circuit's
search
for
fairness
in
campbell
has
ironically
produced
unfairness
by
affording
an
unquestionably
neutral
forum
to
the
injured
worker
while
denying
an
unquestionably
neutral
forum
to
the
insurance
carrier.
and
finally
and
perhaps
most
importantly--
mr.
peter
michael
jung
--well,
in
negligence
cases,
your
honor,
you
still
have
removal.
in
federal...
excuse
me,
in
workers'
compensation
cases
you
do
have
the
anti-removal
statute,
1445(c),
which
prohibits
removal
of
workers'
compensation
cases.
but
an
ordinary
negligence
suit
filed
against
an
out-of-state
party
in
state
court
can
be
removed--
mr.
peter
michael
jung
--the
direct
action?
mr.
peter
michael
jung
looking
only
at
the
statute,
one
could
come
to
that
conclusion.
if
you
review
the
legislative
history,
what
i
think
is
more
apparent
is
that
congress
simply
didn't
focus
on
the
removal
problem.
throughout
the
legislative
history
there
is
a
preoccupation
with
the
state
of
louisiana
and
with
the
phenomenon--
mr.
peter
michael
jung
--well,
they
were
faced
with
the
circumstance
where
plaintiffs,
injured
parties
were
filing
suit,
and
there's
nothing
in
there
to
suggest
that
they
even
thought
about
the
situation
where
the
injured
party
had
filed
suit
in
state
court
and
the
insurance
company
wanted
to
remove.
that
is
not
what
was
causing
the
crowded
dockets
in
louisiana.
it
is
a
basic
anomaly
of
the
statute
in
that
it
does,
as
justice
blackmun
indicated,
create
a
race
to
the
courthouse
in
some
situations.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
well,
there
can
be
that.
if
we
had
filed
this
case,
though,
in
the
state
court
in
lamar
county,
texas,
we
would
have
been
in
front
of
an
elected
judge
who
depends
on
people
like
mr.
brewer
to
elect
him
every
four
years
and
who
depends
for
campaign
contributions
on
the
local
bar,
and
we
would
have
been
the
insurance
company
from
chicago.
and
so
as
trite
as
it
may
sound,
we
filed
the
suit
in
federal
court
for
all
the
traditional
diversity
jurisdiction
reasons,
to
try
and
get
a
more
neutral
forum,
one
in
which
an
out-of-state
company
could
stand
on
an
even
footing.
finally,
the
court
in
campbell
overlooked
the
plain
language
that
congress
used.
in
the
horton
case
this
court
was
faced
with
a
clear
and
unambiguous
statute
that
withdrew
removal
jurisdiction
of
workers'
comp
cases,
but
just
as
plainly
and
unambiguously
left
unaffected,
the
provisions
allowing
original
jurisdiction.
and
this
court
said
in
horton
that
it
must
take
congress
at
its
word.
here
we
have
a
statute
that
withdraws
federal
diversity
jurisdiction
of
direct
actions
against
insurers
but
says
nothing
about
direct
actions
by
insurers.
again,
we
submit,
this
court
should
take
congress
at
its
word.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
the
matter
is
outside
the
record,
i
do
feel
the
need
to
respond
to
justice
marshall's
question.
i
have
the
industrial
accident
board
award
before
me,
and
it
amounts
to
$56,723.99.
so,
this
case
meets
the
$50,000
jurisdictional
limitation,
even
though
it
was
filed
at
a
time
when
the
limitation
was
only
$10,000.
with
respect
to
the
character
of
workers'
compensation
insurance
in
texas
and
its
status
as
liability
insurance,
i
certainly
did
not
mean
to
hide
the
ball
in
my
opening
argument
on
that
point
because
i
believe
it's
wrapped
up
directly
with
the
question
of
direct
action.
in
fact
if,
indeed,
liability
insurance
is
an
indemnity
agreement
and
if,
in
fact,
in
the
state
of
texas
an
employer
is
never
liable
for
workers'
compensation
benefits,
then
it
follows
that
a
texas
workers'
compensation
policy
is
not
an
indemnity
agreement.
it
may
protect
the
employer
from
other
forms
of
liability
for
common
law
negligence,
but
it
does
not
indemnify
him
for
worker's
compensation
liability
because
he
has
no
such
liability.
and,
for
that
reason,
the
key
factor
of
the
employer's
non-liability
goes
to
both
the
direct
action
question
and
to
the
question
of
liability
insurance.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
he
does
not
have
any
liability
even
if
he
buys
the
insurance.
he
may
obligate
the
insurance
company,
but
he
does
not
obligate
himself.
and,
if
a
workers'
compensation
insurer
becomes
insolvent
in
texas,
the
employer
does
not
become
liable
for
those
benefits.
equally
well,
an
employer
could
provide
any
other
form
of
first-party
insurance.
for
example,
accident
insurance.
if
i
as
an
employer
provide
accident
insurance
for
the
benefit
of
my
employees,
no
one
would
seriously
argue
that
that
was
liability
insurance.
what
workers'
compensation
insurance
is
in
texas
is
a
specialized
form
of
accident
insurance
protecting
the
employee
for
on-the-job
injuries,
even
though
the
employer
would
not
have
been
liable
for
those
injuries.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
texas
and
washington
state.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
i
believe
you
could.
texas
and
washington
state
have
this
scheme,
and
my
research
was
inconclusive
as
to
whether
it
exists
elsewhere
in
the
country,
but
at
least
those
two
jurisdictions.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
absolutely
not,
although
the
sixth
circuit
did
focus
on
the
fact
the
employer
and
the
insurance
carrier
were
jointly
and
severally
liable
in
tennessee.
unfortunately
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
notice
or
pay
significant
attention
to
that
on...
that
particular
factor
of
its
own
state's
law
in
texas.
in
fact,
the
respondent
argues
that
campbell
is
right
and
greene
is
wrong.
there
is
serious
doubt
even
within
the
fifth
circuit
concerning
the
campbell
decision.
in
this
case
the
court
said
that
campbell
stands
on
weak
jurisprudential
legs
even
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
it
should
be
limited
to
its
facts
and
has
been
limited
to
its
facts.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
it
did
so,
your
honor,
because
of
the
rule
that
one
fifth
circuit
panel
cannot
overrule
another
fifth
circuit
panel.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
the
court
did
not--
mr.
peter
michael
jung
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
court
did
not
take
the
case
en
banc
in
the
fifth
circuit,
even
though
the
panel
strongly
hinted
that
it
should
do
so.
and,
quite
frankly,
we
expected
to
argue
this
case
in
the
fifth
circuit
en
banc
rather
than
in
this
court.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
well,
that
it
does
or
that
the
case
does
not
otherwise
meet
the
extraordinary
requirements
necessary
for
en
banc
consideration,
which
i
must
admit--
mr.
peter
michael
jung
--exactly.
well,
i
was
greatly
pleased
when
the
court
agreed
to
hear
this
case,
but...
and
disappointed
when
the
fifth
circuit
declined
to
take
it
en
banc.
mr.
peter
michael
jung
but,
mr.
justice
stevens
is
correct.
it
may
well
be
that
the
fifth
circuit
chose
to
merely
adhere
to
its
prior
precedent
unless
and
until
overruled
by
this
court.
there
is,
indeed,
a
potential
race
to
the
courthouse,
and
it
would
be
disingenuous
to
deny
that
such
a
thing
could
exist.
but
that
is
an
artifact,
we
submit,
of
section
1445(c)
which
deprived
the
courts
of
removal
jurisdiction
but
left
the
original
jurisdiction
unaffected
in
workers'
compensation
cases.
and
that
is
true
irrespective
of
what
this
court
does
here
today
with
the
direct
action
proviso.
in
a
suit
where
the
employer,
the
employee
and
the
insurance
carrier
are
all
diverse
from
one
another,
that
suit
may
be
filed
by
either
party
in
the
federal
court
system,
notwithstanding
the
direct
action
proviso,
but
may
not
be
removed
to
that
court
by
any
party.
and
so,
1445(c)
creates
that
race
to
the
courthouse
irrespective
of
the
circumstances
of
the
direct
action
provision.
finally,
on
the
issue
of
clogging
federal
dockets,
i
regret
that
we
did
not
have
modern
statistics
for
the
court,
but
in
the
1958
legislative
history,
the
court
did
have...
the
congress,
excuse
me,
did
have
before
it
the
relative
frequency
of
filing
of
workers'
compensation
suits
in
federal
courts
by
insurance
carriers
in
the
state
of
texas.
and
those
statistics
reveal
as
of
that
year
when
the
jurisdictional
amount
was
only
$3,000
that
less
than
<two>
[=
2]
percent
of
the
workers'
compensation
cases
heard
in
the
texas
federal
courts
were
filed
there
originally
by
insurance
companies.
so,
i
think
that
the
fears
of
overburdened
federal
dockets
are
largely
ephemeral
fears.
in
any
event,
this
court
held
in
the
meredith
versus
city
of
winterhaven
case
that
diversity
jurisdiction
does
not
exist
for
the
court's
convenience.
it
exists
for
the
protection
of
the
litigants
in
those
cases
that
fall
within
the
spirit
and
intent
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
this
is
one
of
those
cases,
and
we,
therefore,
respectfully
urge
that
the
fifth
circuit
be
reversed.
