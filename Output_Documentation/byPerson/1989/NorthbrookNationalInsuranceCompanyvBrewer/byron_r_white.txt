well,
it...
it
stuck
to
it,
and
that
was
the
basis
for
its
decision
in
this
case.
justice
white
well,
i
agree
with
that.
justice
white
but
the
issue
we
have
before
us
is
whether
that
decision
is
right.
justice
white
so,
we
have
to
assume
that
the
entire
fifth
circuit
agrees
with
the
rule
of
law
in
that
circuit.
