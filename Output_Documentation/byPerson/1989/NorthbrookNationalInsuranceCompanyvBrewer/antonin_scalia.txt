justice
scalia
why
does
it
contain
the
language
against
the
insurer
of
a
policy
or
contract
of
liability
then?
justice
scalia
right.
i
didn't
want
to
put
it
that
harshly,
mr.
fults,
but
that's
basically
what's
troubling
me.
justice
scalia
i
might
be
willing
to
make
that
leap
of
faith
if...
if
it...
if
it
made
no
sense
the
way
it's
written.
but
you
can't
say
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
the
way
it's
written.
i
mean,
it
does
serve
the
classic
purpose
of
diversity
jurisdiction
the
way
it's
written.
it
protects
the
out-of-state
insurance
company
against
being
stuck
in
an
in-state
suit,
but...
but
does
not
give
the
in-state
plaintiff
the
opportunity
to
do
the
same.
justice
scalia
the
difference
between
the
court
of
appeals
and
this
court
on
such
matters
is
that
this
court
can
avoid
cases,
but
cannot
avoid
en
banc.
they
can't
avoid
cases,
but
they
can
avoid
en
banc,
and
which
of
the
two
is
more
difficult--
