chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-995,
northbrook
national
insurance
company
versus
larry
brewer.
mr.
tucker...
mr.
jung,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do...
do...
do
you
get
a
jury
trial
in
louisiana
on
a
negligence
claim
if
you're
a
plaintiff?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that...
you're
from
texas.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
jung.
mr.
fultz,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
fults,
when
you
described
something
as
a
local
matter,
do
you
mean
that
it
turns
on
issues
of
local
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
isn't
that
true
of
lots
of
diversity
cases,
that
it's...
all
you
need
is
one
out-of-state
party,
and
you
do
get
a
federal
forum
for
what
is
essentially
strictly
local
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what...
legislative
intent
found
in
the
prohibition
against
removal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
there
was
no
effort
to
remove
here,
was
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
what...
what
else
do
you
derive
your
conclusion
that
they...
they...
congress
didn't
want
workmen's
compensation
cases
in
federal
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
in...
in
horton,
this
court
recognized,
did
it
not,
that
where
the
insurance
company
brought
the
action
in
federal
court
and
did
not
attempt
to
remove
it,
contrary
to
the
statute,
that
that
was
consistent
with
congressional
policy.
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
something
came
after
horton,
you
see.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
know
when
the
proviso
was
enacted,
mr.
fults?
chief
justice
rehnquist
'64,
thank
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
mean
jurisdictional
statutes
should
be
construed
in
favor
of
one
party
or
the
other.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i...
i...
i
would
suggest
to
you
it
doesn't
mean
it
at
all,
directly
or
indirectly.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's...
that's
quite
a
different
argument,
to
say
that
your
argument
carries
out
congressional
intent.
but
to
say
that
because
workmen's
compensation
is
involved
and
because
state
workmen's
compensation
statutes
are
construed
in
favor
of
the
workers,
therefore,
we
should
construe
a
jurisdictional
statute
in
favor
of
the
worker
is
quite
a
different
argument.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that's
a
federal
purpose.
did
you
mean
to
say
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
the
'64
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
you're
relying
on
the
earlier
1958?
chief
justice
rehnquist
which
this
court
said
in
horton
still
permitted
the
insurance
company
to
become
a
plaintiff?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
where
congress
said
nothing
about
workmen's
compensation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
have
to
a
$50,000
to
go
into
diversity
now,
don't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
most
of
those
awards
exceed
$50,000,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fults.
mr.
jung,
you
have
ten
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jung.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-995,
northbrook
national
insurance
company
against
brewer
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
