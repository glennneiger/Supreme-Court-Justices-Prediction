are
there
any
cases
in
which
an...
insurance
companies
that
originally
bring
an
action
have
been
realigned?
justice
kennedy
in
diversity
when
there
is
a
realignment,
then
there
has
to
be
a
reassessment
of
the
residence
of
the
parties.
i
assume
the
same
would
happen
here
and
that
a
suit
originally
brought
by
could
be
against
if
there'd
been
realignment,
although
that's
not
presented
here.
justice
kennedy
well,
does
liability
insurance...
excuse
me...
does
liability
insurance
have
a
well-understood
meaning
in
the
insurance
industry?
justice
kennedy
well,
that
isn't
this
kind
of
policy
in
texas,
though,
is
it?
justice
kennedy
does
the
policy
do
that
or
does
the
state
law
do
that?
the
state
law
does
that,
not
the
policy.
justice
kennedy
but
it's
not
a
liability
policy.
it's
not
indemnifying
the
insured.
it's
merely
a
promise
to
pay
the
insured
for
certain
costs
that
are
incurred,
say,
in
a
health
policy,
and
i
would
think
that
the
workmen's
comp
policy
under
the
texas
scheme
is
very
much
like
that.
i
don't
see
that
the
texas
scheme
makes
this
a
liability
insurance
at
all.
justice
kennedy
well,
if
an
employer
purchases
a
health
insurance
policy
for
the
employees
as
a
fringe
benefit,
you
wouldn't
call
that
a
liability
policy,
would
you?
justice
kennedy
well,
not
for
workmen's
compensation.
he'd
have
it
under
common
law
principles
of
negligence.
