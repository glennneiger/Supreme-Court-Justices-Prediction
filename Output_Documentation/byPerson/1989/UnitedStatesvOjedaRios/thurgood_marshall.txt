we
file
an
opinion
agreeing
with
you,

we,
in

amending
that
statute?
justice
marshall
well,
have...
have
we
yet
an
explanation
of
why
it
wasn't
done?
justice
marshall
well,
will
you
pardon
me

--he
read
the
statute.
the
statute
said
put
the
seal
on

he
didn't
put
it
on.
justice

does
he
explain
that?
justice
marshall
well,
it
said
so.
the
statute
said
so.
can't
he
read?
