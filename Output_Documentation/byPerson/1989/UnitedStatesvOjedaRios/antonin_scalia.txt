justice
scalia
do
we
have
a
judicial
seal?
i
never
had
a
judicial
seal.
do
we
get
issued
these
things?
i
didn't
have
one.
justice
scalia
just
district
judges
have
them
maybe,
huh?
justice
scalia
i
always
wanted
one,
you
know.
you
know,
you
could
put
a
red--
[laughter]
justice
scalia
yeah.
justice
scalia
mr.
bryson,
i
assume
that
if
you...
if
you
don't
do
it
right
away,
the
district
judge...
you
run
the
risk
of
the
district
judge
saying,
i'm
sorry
it's
too
late.
justice
scalia
right?
justice
scalia
so
it...
it
isn't
a
sure
thing
that
there's
no
harm
in...
in
not...
in
not
doing
it
immediately.
justice
scalia
you
were
lucky
here,
though,
he...
he
did
approve
them.
justice
scalia
and
that
same...
that
same
process
would...
would
transpire
whether
it
was
sealed
or
not,
presumably.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
you
could
make
the
same
argument.
justice
scalia
this
seems
to
be
our
week
for
the
dog
that
didn't
bark
legislative
history.
this
is
another
one.
i
mean,
your
point
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
there--
justice
scalia
--that
says
that
it
should
be
excluded
from
that
reason.
justice
scalia
did
he
lick
the
hand?
justice
scalia
okay,
well--
[laughter]
justice
scalia
that's
a...
that's
a
very...
let
me
understand
what
you're
saying.
you're
saying,
assuming
that
you
lose
on
the
point
that--
justice
scalia
--that
the
presence
of
a
seal
means
the
presence
of
a
seal
that
was
put
on
immediately...
right?
justice
scalia
--then
all
you
have
to
do
to
establish
a
satisfactory
explanation
for
the
absence
of
a
seal
that
was
put
on
immediately
is
to
show
that
this
is
nonetheless
an
authentic
tape.
justice
scalia
but
what
is
the
explanation,
though?
it's
very
strange.
justice
scalia
yeah.
justice
scalia
gee,
don't...
don't
you
think
satisfactory
explanation
must
mean
an
explanation
as
to
why
the
delay
is
excusable?
justice
scalia
i...
i...
nobody
would
read
it
that
way.
justice
scalia
so
long
as
you--
justice
scalia
--no,
no.
justice
scalia
do
you
think
it's
a
satisfactory
explanation
if
the
department
comes
in
and
says,
well,
you
know,
we
just...
just
didn't
want
to
take
it
to
this
judge
and
we...
and,
yeah,
we
know
we
should
have
taken
it
in,
but
we
just
didn't
want
to
do
it?
justice
scalia
we
had
an
attorney
general
who
didn't
believe
in
this
provision
of
the
law
and
we
decided
not
to
take
it
in.
but
we
assure
you
it
has
not
been
tampered
with.
justice
scalia
and
that
is
a
satisfactory
explanation,
as
i
understand
you're...
you're
saying.
justice
scalia
nobody
is
perfect.
right--
justice
scalia
of
course,
because
that
is
what
they
were
talking
about.
justice
scalia
they
didn't
want
to
say
any
seal
in
the
world
would
suffice.
justice
scalia
how
else
would
they
have
said
it
if
they
just
meant,
you
know,
the
kind
of
a
seal
we
were
talking
about?
not
necessarily
timely,
but...
but
the
seal
that
we
have
been
talking
about
here.
justice
scalia
well,
wait...
your...
your...
come
to
think
of
it,
that
is
the
logical
consequence
of
your
argument.
you...
you
cannot
even
apply
to
get
a
seal
late
because
that
would
not
be
the
seal
as
provided
for
by
this
section.
it's
no
use
if
you're
late,
right?
justice
scalia
why
not?
justice
scalia
yeah?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
i'm
a
district
judge
and
i
say,
gee,
i
cannot
give
you
a
seal
as
provided
for
in
this
subsection
because
a
seal
as
provided
for
in
this...
in
this
subsection...
does
it
say
subsection?
is
that
what
it
is?
yes.
justice
scalia
i
cannot
provide
you
a
seal
as
provided
for
by
this
subsection
because
such
a
seal
is
a
seal
that
is
issued
immediately
upon
expiration
of
the...
of
the
order.
the
order
has
long...
expired
two
days
ago.
i'm
sorry,
i
cannot
give
you
such
a
seal.
that
would
be
a
terrible
result.
surely
you
want
it
sealed
as
soon
as
possible.
justice
scalia
i
think
you're
right
about
that
but
i
also
think
the
parent,
if
he
or
she
did
not
get
a
satisfactory
explanation,
would
not
throw
the
kid
out
of
the
house
for
the
rest
of
the
night.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
i
didn't
understand.
justice
scalia
what...
in
what
respect
have
they
not
agreed...
has
not
a
single
one
of
them
agreed--
justice
scalia
--with
the
government?
in
what
respect?
justice
scalia
does
any
of
them
find
an
unsatisfactory
explanation
and
exclude
the
tape?
justice
scalia
has
there
been
any
case
where
there
was
a
seal
but
that
it
was
put
on
late
where
the
evidence
was
excluded?
justice
scalia
if
we
adopt
your
rule
that
in
effect
a
late-sealed...
a
late-sealed
intercept
is...
is
invalid,
wouldn't
you
have
two
district
judges
passing
upon
the
same
question?
i
assume
the
first
district
judge
to
whom
the
thing
is
presented,
you
bring
it
up
to
him
and
say,
please
seal
this.
don't
you
think
he
has
an
obligation
not
to
seal
it
if
he
thinks
there's
no
excuse
for
bringing
it
to
him
this
late
or
do
you
think
the
seal
goes
on
automatically?
justice
scalia
i
think
if...
if
you
win
this
case
that
probably
has
to
be...
has
to
be
correct
or
you're
going
to
have
two
judges
basically
passing
on
the
same
thing...
two
district
judges.
