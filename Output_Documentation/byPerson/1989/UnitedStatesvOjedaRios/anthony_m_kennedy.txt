justice
kennedy
as
a
practical
matter,
once
the
tapes
have
been
sealed
and
the
government
wants
to
have
access
to
them
to
prepare
for
trial,
what
do
they
do,
make
copies?
justice
kennedy
so
you
make
a
copy
in
advance
of
submitting
it
to
seal?
justice
kennedy
but
as
i
understand
it,
you
would
have
to
go
through
the
lengthy
hearing
in
all
cases
to
authenticate.
justice
kennedy

we're
presuming
there's
no
seal.
justice
kennedy

you...
do
you
interpret
the
term
"extension"
to
modify
the

period
of
the
order?
i
mean,
upon
the--
justice

--separation
of
the
period
of
the
order
or
extensions
thereof.
