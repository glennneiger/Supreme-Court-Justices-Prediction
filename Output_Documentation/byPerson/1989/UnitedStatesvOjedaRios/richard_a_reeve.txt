mr.
richard
a.
reeve
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
title
iii
mandates
that
all
electronic
surveillance
recordings
are
to
be
sealed
immediately
upon
the
expiration
of
each
order
or
extensions
thereof.
it
is
undisputed
in
this
case,
that
the
government
violated
that
statutory
mandate.
in
addition
to
creating
the
requirement
of
an
immediate
seal,
congress,
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
subsection,
created
an
independent
prophylactic
rule
of
exclusion.
that
rule
of
exclusion
does
not
contain
a
prejudice
test
as
the
government
contends
today
before
this
court.
in
fact,
the
sole
exception
to
that
rule
of
exclusion
is
if
the
government
provides
a
satisfactory
explanation
for
the
absence
of
that
immediate
seal.
none
was
provided
in
this
case.
the
courts
below
were
correct
in
finding
no
satisfactory
explanation
and
excluding
the
evidence.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
your
honor,
it
is
not
explicit
in
that
way,
but
i--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--it
does
not
in
that
sentence
of
the
provision.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
yes,
your
honor,
and
i'd
like
to
address
that.
and
i
think
that
there
are
three
questions
that
can
reasonably
be
asked
in
construing
this
statute.
number
one,
what
did
congress
say?
number
two,
what
did
congress
not
say?
and,
number
three,
did
congress
know
how
to
create
a
prejudice
test
in
a
rule
of
exclusion
if
they
desired
to
do
so?
and
i'd
like
to
focus
on
the
language
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
which
is
the
question
that
you
raised.
it
is
correct,
and
justice
o'connor
noted,
that
the
language
requires
"the
presence
of
the
seal
provided
for
by
this
subsection.
"
the
language
does
not
say
the
presence
of
a
judicial
seal
or
the
presence
of
a
seal.
it
says
that
seal
provided
for
by
this
subsection.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
exactly
right.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
that...
well,
that's--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that...
that...
that
it's
clear
when
you
look
back,
when
you
asked
the
question...
what
is
the
seal
provided
for
by
this
subsection?
it
is
not
just
a
judicial
seal.
it
is
an
immediate
seal
and
there's
no
question
about
that.
in
fact
the
government
in
its
reply--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--well,
your
honor,
it
does
although
it
doesn't--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--well,
your
honor,
i
respectively
differ
with
the
court
in...
in
terms
of
what
the
language
is.
what
is
says
is
a
satisfactory
explanation
for
the
absence
thereof.
and
the
word
"thereof"
is
used
not
just
in
that
sentence
but
in
the
first
sentence
which
is
in
question,
where
the
statute
says
"the
period
of
the
order
or
extensions
thereof.
"
and
just
as
that
thereof
refers
to
the
period
of
the
order,
in
this
case,
a
satisfactory
explanation
for
the
absence
thereof
refers
to
the
seal
as
provided
for
by
this
subsection
and,
as
i
have
previously
discussed,
the
seal
provided
for
by
this
subsection
is
an
immediate
seal.
it's
not
a
seal
the
day
before
the
tapes
are
sought
to
be
admitted.
it's
an
immediate
seal.
congress
could
have
said
it
differently,
but
they
did
not.
and
justice
scalia
inquired
of
my
brother
counsel
as
to
whether
or
not,
if
the
tapes
were
submitted
to
a
district
court
judge
the
day
before
the
government
sought
to
admit
that
evidence,
would
that
judge...
might
that
judge
refuse
to
seal
those
tapes.
my
suggestion
is
when
you
look
at
the
statutory
language
there
is
no
authority
on
the
part
of
a
district
court
judge
to
do
that
and
the
government
would
argue
precisely
that
before
a
district
court.
what
the
statute
says
is
the
recording
shall
first
be
made
available
to
the
judge
issuing
such
order
and,
two,
sealed
under
his
direction.
shall.
the
mandatory
term
of
that
sentence
clearly
applies
to
both
the
submission
and
the
seal.
and
if
that
isn't
clear
there,
it's
clear
in
subsection
b
of
2518--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
because
that...
that
section,
immediately
upon
the
expiration
of
the
period
of
the
order--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--defines
when
the
government
is
to
do
it.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
now,
if
the
government--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
your
honor,
it
would
be
my
interpretation
of
the
statute,
based
on
the
language
in
that
sentence
as
well
as
in
the
language
of
the
second
section,
that
is,
subsection
b
which
says
all
orders
and
applications
shall
be
sealed
by
the
court,
that
the
court
does
have
a
mandatory
duty,
and
that
the
government
could
make
that
argument.
that's
not
a
central
issue,
i
don't
believe,
to
the
proper
interpretation
of
this
section
because
the
reality
is
that...
i
believe
and
in
our
view...
the
language
is
plain,
and
congress
put
that
language
"provided
for
by
this
subsection"
in
there
for
a
clear
reason.
otherwise...
otherwise
the
statutory
provision
simply
does
not
make
sense.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
your
honor,
i
would
respond
in
two
ways.
there
is
no
specific
individualized
prejudice
in
this
situation.
that
is,
and
the
reason
is,
congress
did
not
create
a
prejudice
test.
the
same
prejudice
is
suffered
by
everyone...
everyone
in
this
courtroom
when
the
government
violates
the
law.
it
is
a
prophylactic
rule.
that
was
what
congress
established.
and
so
there
is
no
specific
prejudice.
it
is
the
general
prejudice
occurs
whenever
the
government
violates
the
law.
and
that's
what
congress
intended
to
avoid.
and
i
would
like
to
get
to
that
issue
because
the
next
issue
which
the
government
raises
is,
well,
how
do
we
define
the
term
"satisfactory
explanation"
for
the
absence
of
that
immediate
seal?
and
i
think
you
have
to
apply
common
sense,
and
i'd
like
to
suggest
a
common,
everyday
situation
which
might
shed
some
light
on
the
situation.
suppose
a
parent
imposes
a
curfew
on
his
son
and
it's
a
12:00
midnight
curfew.
the
son
goes
out,
comes
home
at
3:00
a.m.
the
parent
sits
the
child
down
in
the
living
room
and
says,
you're
not
home
until
after
three
hours
after
that
curfew,
you'd
better
have
a
good
explanation
and
i'd
like
to
hear
it
now.
now,
if
the
child
responds
as
the
government
contends
is
an
appropriate
response
here
in
this
context,
if
the
child
responds,
well,
i
didn't
get
in
any
trouble
out
there
so
don't
worry
about
it,
no
harm/no
foul,
the
parent
is
going
to
say,
that
is
not
what
i
asked
you.
i
asked
you
why
you
violated
the
curfew.
why
is
it
that
you're
three
hours
late?
and
that's
exactly
what
this
statute
asks.
what
is
the
explanation
for
why
you
failed,
why
you
violated
the
law?
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
your
honor,
i...
i
suppose
there's
all
different
kinds
of
parents
in
the
world,
and--
[laughter]
i...
my
children
are
not
yet
old
enough
that
i
have
to
worry
about
curfews.
i'm
going
to
get
to
that
in
a
few
years.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
congress
made
a
decision
as
to
what
the
appropriate
remedy
is.
and
that
is
a
decision
which
members
of
this
court
may
feel
is
wrong.
everyday...
all
of
us
feel
that
congress
creates
statutes
which
may
in
our
judgement,
be
wrong.
but
it's
not...
with
all
respect
to
the
court,
it's
not
this
court's
position
to
determine
whether
or
not
that's
a
wise
statute.
congress
imposed
it.
it
created
a
prophylactic
rule,
and
it's
there.
and
i
think
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
prejudice
test
can
also
be
answered
by
thinking
about
did
congress
know
how
to
create
a
prejudice
test,
if
it
desired
to
do
so
in
a
rule
of
exclusion.
the
answer
is
clearly
yes.
if
one
takes
a
look
at
other
statutes
in
the
area
of
criminal
law...
for
example,
the
speedy
trial
act,
section
3162(b),
i
believe
it
is,
which
this
court
reviewed
recently
in
the
taylor
case...
what
that
test
in
that
section
is,
congress
said
in
a
district
court
in
determining
whether
or
not
an
indictment
should
he
dismissed
with
or
without
prejudice
shall
consider
the
following
factors.
there
congress
created
a
prejudice
test.
alternatively,
in
the
jenks
act,
section
3500,
congress
created
a
mandatory
exclusion
provision.
if
the
government
elects
not
to
comply
with
an
order
of
the
court
to
turn
over
evidence,
either
the
testimony
is
stricken
or,
if
the
court
determines
it
is
in
the
interest
of
justice,
a
mistrial
is
ordered.
some
of
us
may
disagree,
but
that's
what
congress
said.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
your
honor,
with
respect,
i
think
it's
important
to
break
down
the
issue,
and...
and
i
want
to
address
it.
first
of
all,
with
respect
to
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
provision
implies
to
late
sealed
tapes
as
well
as
unsealed
tapes,
there
is
unanimity
among
every
circuit.
there
is
not
a
single
lower
court
decision
that
supports
the
government's
interpretation
in
their
first
argument.
with
respect
to
the
second
issue,
there
are,
i
believe,
four
courts
who
in
various
ways
say
we
really
need
to
focus
on
tampering.
with
all
respect,
i
suppose--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
that's
why
this
court
accepted,
as
i
understand
it,
accepted
this
case
on
certiorari.
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that
analysis.
i
think
that
it
would
be
presumptuous
for
me
to
try
to
analyze
or
psychoanalyze
why
they
did
what
they
did.
with
all
respect
to
those
lower
courts,
we
believe
that
they
erred.
and
i
want
to...
in
terms
of--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
the
government's
initial
argument,
that
is,
that
the
exclusionary
provision
of
section
2518(8)(a)
only
applies
to
cases
where
the
seal
is
absent.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
but
it
does
not
apply
to
cases
where
the
seal
is
late.
there
is
not
a
single
court
which
has...
which
has
held
that.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
your
honor,
in
a
number
of
cases
it
was
and
those
courts
have
held.
in...
in
the
other
cases,
i
can't
tell,
your
honor,
that
the
argument
was
made
in
each
of
those
cases.
what
i
can
say
is
that
every
single
sealing
case
that's
reported
that
i'm
aware
of
deals
with
late
sealed
tapes.
none
deal
with
absence.
and
they
all
reached
the
issue
of
satisfactory
explanation.
they
applied
different
tests
to
that
question,
but
they
all
reached
that
issue.
so
at
the
least,
implicitly,
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
that
in
all
of
those
decisions
the
issue
was
raised
by
the
government.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
your
honor,
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief,
there's
only
one
reported
decision
that
i
am
aware
of
where
a
court
of
appeals
has
specifically
excluded
evidence.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
where
the
government
has
conceded
a
violation
of
the
statute
and
it
has
not
been
litigated
in
a
court
appeals.
that
is--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
case
of
united
states
v.
gigante.
in
addition,
i
would
cite
to
the
court
united
states
v.
fury.
that
is
a...
that
is
a
case
where
the
government
conceded
that
they
had
violated
the
statute
and
the
question
there
was
a
derivative
use
question.
there
are
decisions
where
tapes
have
been
excluded.
there
are
not
a
number
of
decisions
where
the
issue
has
been
resolved.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
it
is,
your
honor,
and
it
is...
it
is
a
second
circuit
case.
i
want
to
get
back,
if
i
might,
to
the
issue
of
does
congress
know
how
to
create
a
prejudice
test
because
i
think,
importantly
in
the
context
of
this
case,
if
you
look
at
title
ii
of
the
omnibus
crime
control
act
of
1968,
that
was,
as
the
court
is
probably
aware,
the...
what
i
would
refer
to
as
congress'
effect...
attempt,
excuse
me...
to
legislatively
repeal,
if
you
will,
this
court's
decision
in
miranda.
and
what
congress
did
is
they
passed...
i
believe
it's
section
3501
of
title
18...
which
basically
relegated
the
giving
of
miranda
warnings
to
one
category,
and
they
indicated
none
of
these
are
dispositive.
if
there
was
any
question
that
congress
did
not
create
a
prejudice
test
in
this
section,
one
need
only
look
at
the
very
next
subsection
of
section
2518
of
title
iii...
and
i
refer
to
section
2518,
subsection
9.
and
in
that
provision
congress
required--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--your
honor,
it
may
not
be.
i
have
a
copy
of
the
united
states
code
here--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--i
don't
believe
it's...
i
don't
believe
it's
in
the
briefs,
and
i
apologize
for
that.
it's
an
analogy
that
i
want
to
make
because
that
section
requires
ten-day
notice.
it's
a
ten-day
notice
rule
before
the
government
seeks
to
admit
title
iii
recordings.
and
what
congress
said
in
that
very
next
subsection
is...
they
said,
there's
an
exception
here.
if...
it's
two...
it's
based
on
two
conditions.
number
one,
if
it
was
not
possible
to
comply
with
that
and
if
the
defendant
is
not
prejudiced
by
the
lesser
amount
of
disclosure.
and
so
had
congress
wanted
to
create
a
prejudice
test
within
this
sealing
requirement,
they
clearly
knew
how
to
do
it.
they
would
have
done
it
and
they
didn't
do
it.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
that's
correct.
that's
exactly
right.
and
congress
specifically
used
the
term
"prejudice",
whereas
in
this
section,
there
is
no
reference
to
prejudice.
and
the
government
effectively
is
asking
this
court
to
find
it
somewhere
out
there
somehow
in
the
term
and
the
requirements
satisfactory
explanation.
it's
not
there.
it
doesn't
exist,
and
it
shouldn't
be
found.
the
other...
the
other
thing
that
i
would
just
suggest
to
this
court
is
that
the
giordano
case,
a
unanimous
decision
by
the
court
with
respect
to
the
issue
involved...
that
i
want
to
address.
it
was
a
decision
authored
by
justice
white.
it
was
a
decision
in
which
the
question
was
whether
or
not
the
executive
assistant
attorney
general
was
an
authorized
person
within
title
iii
to
authorize
an
application.
this
court
looked
at
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
said
no.
one
of
the
arguments
made
by
the
solicitor
general
in
that
case
was
as
follows.
an
affidavit
by
the
executive
assistant
attorney
general
which
said,
gee,
the
reason
i
signed
this
is
because
the
attorney
general
was
out
of
town.
i
knew
he
would
have
authorized
it.
i
talked
to
him
afterwards.
he
would
have
authorized
it.
in
effect,
if
you
will,
a
result-oriented
approach
to
an
exclusion
provision
in
title
iii.
this
court
rejected
that,
said
congress
has
decided
the
remedy.
congress
has
decided
where
there's
exclusion
and
it's
up
to
congress.
and,
your
honors,
my
suggestion
is
that's
exactly
the
appropriate
position
that
this
court
should
take.
and,
indeed,
what
happened
two
years
after
giordano
is
congress
amended
the
statute.
and
that's
the
procedure
we
should
apply
here.
if
the
statute's
wrong,
then
the
justice
department
should
approach
it
and
convince
congress
to
amend
it.
but
not
come
before
this
court.
the...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
i
think...
my
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
that
the
seal
goes
on
automatically.
that's
an
issue
which,
as
far
as
i
know,
has
not
been
litigated
in
the
courts
below.
but
it
would
be
my...
it
would
be
my
view
and
my
interpretation
that
that's...
that
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
well,
i
suppose
that
that
might
be
correct
although
there's
no
statutory
test
that...
that
establishes,
for
example,
assuming
that
the
initial
judge
has
to
do
some
tests,
what
that
test
is.
the
test
is
set
up
for
the
district
court
dealing
with
the
tapes
because--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--it
comes
up
in
the
context
of
this
pleading.
excuse
me?
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
it
certainly
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
that's
right.
it's
an
ex
parte
proceeding
in
which
defense
wouldn't
be
given
any
notice
and
in
effect
you'd
be
replacing
the
adversary
process
with
such
an
ex
parte
hearing.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
your
honor,
the
satisfactory
explanation
plays
a
critical
component.
if
the
government
fails
to
immediately
seal
the
tapes
and
the
courts
have
pretty
uniformly
held
immediate
as
within
one
or
two
working
days
of
the
court,
then
the
government
bears
the
burden
of
coming
before
the
district
court
and
establishing
a
satisfactory
explanation.
that,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
is
something
more
than
negligence,
it's
something
more
than
a
gross
misreading
of
the
statute,
and
the
court
looks
at
it
and
considers
a
number
of
questions.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
yes,
in
effect
that's
right,
your
honor.
and
the
courts...
the
second
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
first
circuit
look
at
a
number
of
factors.
the
principal
factors,
we
believe,
are,
number
one,
how
long
was
the
delay?
number
two,
why
did
the
delay
occur?
number
three,
is
this
part
of
a
pattern
of
violations
of
this
sealing
requirement?
we
have
in
this
case
all
three.
in
effect,
the
court
below
looks
at
the
totality
of
those
circumstances
that
are
relevant
to
the
question
that
the
statute
asks.
why?
and
the
district
court
makes
a
determination
based
on
his
assessment.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
yes.
yes
and
i
based
that
on
two
words.
one,
the
government
must
supply
an
explanation.
number
two,
the
government
must
supply
an
explanation
which
is
satisfactory.
they
cannot
merely
come
in
and
say,
this
is
why
we
did
it,
and
that's
all
the
inquiry.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
i
think
that
in
some
circumstances,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
i
think
that's
possible.
i
think
it's
going
to
depend
on
the
length
of
delay
which
develops
and
whether
or
not
there
is
a
conduct,
a
repeated
pattern
such
as
here.
in
our
case
what
we
have
is
all
three.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
well--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--your
honor,
i'd
like
to
get
to
that
issue
because
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--it
is
the
claim
and
i
don't
that's
what
happened,
and
i
think
that
the
record
is
clear.
and
i
would
refer
the
court
specifically
in
the
joint
appendix--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--well,
there
is
language
in
the
district
court
decision--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--well,
the
district...
there
is
language
in
there,
but
the...
but
the
district
court
also
did
make
extensive
findings
of
fact
and
at
page
78(a),
which
is
in
the...
attached...
his
ruling
attached
to
the
petition
for
certiorari...
the
district
court
finds
in
effect
gross
negligence.
and...
and
i
think
that
there
are
some
differences.
but
for
purposes
of
this
case--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--it
was
not,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
is
this.
the
prosecutor
here
decided,
even
in
light
and
in
the
face
of
the
statutory
requirement
of
immediate
sealing,
in
light
of
a
memo
that
he
had
from
the
justice
department
that
said,
if
you
don't
immediately
seal,
you
risk
suppression.
without
reading
the
case
law...
he
admitted
he
hadn't
read
the
case
law
before
he
made
this
decision...
without
looking
at
a
treatise
that
he
had
on
his
desk
that
said...
specifically
rejected
his
theory
and
he
was
asked
at
the
district
court--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--his
theory
that
when
you
have
one
big
wiretap
investigation,
you
don't
have
to
seal
until
the
very
end.
that
was
the
theory
that
he
went
forward.
he
was
asked,
under
your
theory,
there
is
no...
arguably
no
limit
to
how
far
out
that's
going
to
take.
if
the
wiretap
investigation
takes
five
years,
well
you've
got
a
five-year
sealing
delay.
yes,
that's
correct.
it
was
an
unlimited,
if
you
will,
venture,
way,
way
out
beyond
the
statute.
and
that
kind
of
conduct
by
the
justice
department
does
not
sanction,
does
not
warrant,
the
label
of
a
satisfactory
explanation.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
that...
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
and
in
my
view,
and
in
the
view
of
the
second
circuit
and
a
number
of
courts,
congress
would
have
been
perhaps
wiser
in
saying
after
every
order
and
then
after
every
single
extension.
that
is,
every
30
days
you--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--correct.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
correct.
without...
without
allowing
the
government
to
seek
extensions.
but
that,
again,
gets
to
the
wisdom
of
congress.
it's
not
a
perfect
statute.
it
doesn't
prohibit
tampering,
but
it
was
designed
to
avoid
the
opportunity
for
tampering.
and
that's
the
critical
problem...
one
of
the
critical
problems
with
the
government's
argument.
the
government
says
the
sole
purpose
is
tampering.
that's
not
the
sole
purpose.
there
are
a
number
of
purposes
and
they
are
set
forth
in
the
legislative
history
and
they
include
the
following.
number
one,
congress
intended
to
create
immediate
direct
judicial
supervision
over
wiretap
evidence.
number
two--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--well,
i
think
in
part
that
was
a
response
to
this
court's
ruling
in--
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
--berger
and
katz.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
a.
reeve
absolutely.
that's
ultimate
statutory
purpose.
but
what
congress
did
was,
looking
at
that
ultimate
statutory
purpose,
congress
decided
the
best
most
effective
way
to
approach
that
ultimate
goal
of
the
statute
is
to
have
that
judicial
supervision
to
reduce
the
opportunities
for
tampering.
congress
knew
it
couldn't
avoid
all
tampering.
the
government
argues
that.
if...
if
a
prosecutor
or
a
law
enforcement
agent
is
bent
on
tampering
with
evidence,
he's
going
to
do
it.
and
congress
knew
it
couldn't
avoid
that.
but
what
it
decided
is...
we're
going
to
create
this
standard
to
say
to
the
government,
you
got
to
turn
them
in.
and
that
judicial
supervision
is
going
to
reduce
the
incentive
and
the
opportunity
for
tampering
with
those
tapes.
and
it
responded
as
well
to
this
court...
as
i
was
referring
to
earlier,
to
this
court's
rulings
in
berger
and
katz,
where
one
of
the
problems
with
the
statute,
the
new
york
state
statute,
was...
and
the
court
noted
there
was
no
return
to
a
judicial
officer.
the
same
problem
noted
in
katz.
that
was
one
of
the
problems
specifically
referred
to
in
the
congressional
history
in
the
senate
report.
in
addition,
congress
was
concerned
about
the
potential
abuses.
it
was
clear
at
that
time
in
1968,
when
the
statute
was
passed,
that
wiretap
was
a
dangerous
area.
it
was
ripe
for
abuse.
and
congress
was
concerned.
and
what
the
decision
was...
and
it
may
not
be
a
decision
which
every
single
member
of
this
court
agrees
is
the
right
line,
but
they
created
a
line...
immediate
sealing
upon
the
expiration
of
the
orders
or
extensions
thereof.
and
it's
a
line
they
drew,
and
it's
an
appropriate
line.
it
may
not
be
the
perfect
line.
the...
and
so
i
think
that
that's...
even
if
you
get
to
the
question
of
statutory
purpose
in
legislative
history,
it
aids
our
view,
not
the
government's.
there
are
two
other
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
number
one,
the
government's
test,
if
adopted
by
this
court,
is
going
to
require
tampering
hearings
in
every
district
court,
in
every
sealing
violation,
regardless
of
whether
it's
a
short
delay
where
the
government's
explanation
may
be
very,
very
reasonable,
because
what
they're
asking
the
court
to
do
is
define
satisfactory
explanation
as
no
tampering.
once
that
definition
is
established,
in
cases
where
the
test
created
by
the
second
circuit
is
in
fact
very,
very
helpful
to
the
government.
and
the
test
applied
has
been
extremely
liberally...
liberally
applied.
excuse
me.
under
the
government's
theory,
we're
going
to
have
tampering
hearings,
and
experts
coming
in.
and
that,
in
some
ways
addresses
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
raised,
which
is
this
case
has
gone
on
for
years
and
years.
and
does
this
court
want
to
create
a
standard
where
you
are
going
to
compel
district
courts
to
have
those
kind
of
hearings?
the
hearings
that
occurred
here
that
were
not
satisfying,
the
district
court
made
no
finding
on
any
of
the
excluded
tapes.
there
is
no
finding
that
those
tapes
were
not
tampered
with.
none
at
all.
he
only
found
them
with
the
tapes
that
were
not
excluded.
finally,
in
conclusion,
the...
the
government
came
first
before
this
court
in
its
petition
for
certiorari
on
page
11
and
the
government
said
in
that
petition,
this
is
a
serious
problem
because
despite
the
best
efforts
of
a
supervising
attorney
in
a
wiretap
case,
there
will
be
occasions
on
which
the
tapes
will
not
be
immediately
sealed.
congress
agreed
with
that
and
that's
why
they
created
a
satisfactory
explanation.
but
as
the
delays
get
longer,
you
need
a
better
and
better
reason.
but
the
problem,
and
the
second
circuit
has
adopted
that
approach...
it
is
an
approach
which
allows
the
best
efforts
of
a
supervising
attorney.
what
the
government
is
effectively
asking
this
court
to
do
today
is
to
rewrite
the
statute
to
avoid
separation
of
powers
issues...
to
avoid
issues
of
judicial
restraint...
all
so
that
we
can...
protect
the
negligent,
sometimes
willful,
sloppy,
intentional
bad
faith
conduct
of
officers
of
the
united
states
justice
department.
that,
we
believe,
is
a
road
that
this
court
should
not
travel
down.
thank
you.
