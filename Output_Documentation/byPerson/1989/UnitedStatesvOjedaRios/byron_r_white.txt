justice
white
does
that
just
go
to
the
explanation
for
the
absence
of
the
seal
or
with
respect
to
authenticity?
justice
white
only?
justice
white
i
know,
but
you
seem
to
say
that
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
prove
that
the
tapes
are...
haven't
been
tampered
with.
justice
white
and
that's
why
you
delayed.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
i
got
you.
all
right.
justice
white
--well,
on
that...
on
that
basis
you
don't
even...
never...
don't
have
to
have
it
sealed
at
all.
ever.
there's
no
reason
to
do
it,
you're
saying,
so
long
as
it's
authentic.
who
cares
about
a
seal?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you...
but
you
would
still
have
this
satisfactory
explanation
if
there
wasn't
a
seal.
this
is
a--
justice
white
--here's
why
we
do...
we
just
don't
believe
in
seals,
we
never
did,
and
we
don't
think
there
ought
to
be
a
seal
on
this
tape.
justice
white
that's...
now,
is
it
satisfactory?
well,
yes
it
is
because
the
tapes
are...
haven't
been
tampered
with.
justice
white
do
you
have
a
fall-back
position?
justice
white
well,
how...
how
did
all
these
other...
other
circuit
courts
of
appeals
get
off
the
trolley.
was
it
four...
four
others?
justice
white
and
there...
there
are
four
other
courts
that
would...
would
have
come
out
differently
in
this
case.
justice
white
is
the...
is
the
failure
excusable?
is
that
what
you're
asking?
justice
white
--can
a
good
faith
mistake
of
law
be
a
decent
explanation?
justice
white
like
where
reasonable
men
might
differ
on
what
the
law
means?
justice
white
well,
you
know...
i
know,
but
here
the
claim
was
that
each
time
there
was
the
same
mistake
of
law--
justice
white
--and
each
time
it
was
a
good
faith
mistake
of
law.
justice
white
well,
isn't
that
the
claim?
justice
white
well,
the
district
court
seemed...
at
least
in
one
case,
seemed
to
think
that,
good
faith
or
not,
it
was
just
too
long.
justice
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
has
specifically
disagreed
with
that.
justice
white
so
it
just
wasn't
really
a
good
faith
and
excusable
mistake
of
law,
is
that
right?
justice
white
well,
i
should
assume
that
if
the
period
of
the
order
is
extended
a
number
of
times,
there
is
going
to
vast
quantity
of
tapes
that
are
just
sitting
around
until
the
government
brings
them
into
the
court
to
be
sealed.
justice
white
after
every
period.
after
period--
justice
white
--is
extended.
justice
white
well,
wouldn't
you
apply
some
sort
of
a...
objective
test
to
whether
he
was
justified
in
believing
that?
justice
white
the
courts
below
thought
that
there
was
just
no
basis
for
that.
