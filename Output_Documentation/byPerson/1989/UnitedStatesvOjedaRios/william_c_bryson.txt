mr.
william
c.
bryson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
federal
wiretapping
statute,
and
in
particular,
the
provision
of
that
statute
that
deals
with
the
requirement
that
at
the
termination
of
interceptions
or
extensions
thereof,
a
judge
must
seal
the
wiretap...
the
products
of
the
wiretap
or
oral
interceptions.
i'll
use
the
term
"wiretap",
if
i
may,
just
as
a
shorthand
to
cover
both
wiretaps
and
oral
interceptions.
the
case
arose
from
a
lengthy
16-month
wiretap
investigation
in
puerto
rico,
where
a
total
of
about
a
thousand,
somewhat
in
excess
of
a
thousand,
tapes
were
generated
in
the
course
of
the
investigation.
when
the
prosecution
was
initiated
in
connecticut,
the
defendants
moved
to
suppress
the
wiretap
evidence
on
a
large
number
of
grounds.
the
district
court
denied
the
vast
bulk
of
those
grounds,
but
granted
the
suppression
motion
in
part
with
respect
to
two
groups
of
tapes
on
one
ground.
and
that
ground
was
that
the
tapes
with...
those
two
sets
of
tapes
had
not
been
sealed
quickly
enough
after
the
termination
of
the
interceptions
and
the
extensions,
as
the
district
court
construed
the
term
2518(8)(a)
of
the
wiretap
statute.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
a
number
of
the
defendants
have
been
brought
to
trial.
the
ones
who
are
before
the
court
here
are
the
ones
that
were
severed
out
at
the
time
of
the...
or
following
the
loss
of
the
evidence
from
suppression
because
these
were
the
defendants
as
to
whom
that
evidence
was
deemed
to
be
essential.
there
were
a
number
of
other
defendants
who
have
already
been
tried
and
most
of
them
have
been
convicted.
one
was
acquitted.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
he...
he
remains
at
large--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--oh,
that's
right,
your
honor,
because
we
have...
there
has
been
ongoing
litigation
on
this
issue
ever
since.
there's
never
been
a
point
in
which
nothing
was
going
on.
in
fact,
this
case
has
had
an
enormous
amount
of
activity
all
the
way
through.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
we
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
let
me
move
to
that
argument.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
as
are
we,
and
it
could
be
said
to...
to
do
so,
and
the
second
circuit,
the
first
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit
have
concluded
that
that
is
the
proper
reading
of
the
statute.
we
think
it's
a
very
unnatural
reading
of
the
statute
which
isn't
supported
either
by
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
by
its
legislative
history
or
really
by
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
and
let
me
turn
to
that,
if
i
may,
right
now.
the
language,
as
you
say,
is
the
presence
of
the
seal
provided
for
by
this
subsection.
our
view
is
that
means
the
judicial
seal,
the
seal
that
a
judge
must
put
on
the
tapes
at
the
time
that
the
tapes
are...
are
sealed.
now,
the...
it
then
says,
or
a
satisfactory
explanation
for
the
absence
thereof.
now,
the
purpose--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no,
your
honor--
[laughter]
mr.
william
c.
bryson
district
judges
are--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it...
this
is
i
think...
it
may
not
be
exclusive
to
this
statute--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--but
it
certainly
is
unusual
to
have
courts
involved
in
sealing
evidence.
but
basically
it's
the
same
thing
as
the
seal
that
any
one
uses
in
the...
in
the
context
of
establishing
chain
of
custody.
you
take
a
piece
of
evidence
tape
and
you
wrap
it
around
the
box
and
you've
sealed
it.
you
put
your
initials
on
it
and
it's
a
judicial
seal.
so,
it's
nothing
really
more
complicated
than
that.
the
judge
can
vary
the
procedure
if
he
likes,
but
basically
that's
the
process.
now,
if
congress
had
met...
congress
is
using
the
words
presence
and
absence
of
the
seal.
now,
presence
and
absence
suggests
that
if
you
look
for
it
and
you
say
it's
absent,
nothing's
there.
in
fact,
the
argument
that
the
defendants
are
making
is
that,
well,
this...
what's
absent
is
a
timely
imposed
seal,
a
timely
affixed
seal,
which
is
a
very
awkward
way
to
put
the
point,--
congress,
if
they
had
wanted
to
deal
with
both
delay
and
absence,
could
have
easily
said
a
seal
not
timely
affixed...
or
delay
or
absence.
but
they
said
absence.
what's
more,
the...
if
you
look
at
other
applications
of
the
same
principle
that
they...
they
argue
for,
it
demonstrates,
i
think,
how
strange
the
language
is
to...
to
import
so
much...
to
put
so
much
weight
on
the
phrase
"provided
for
by
this
subsection".
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
certainly
section
2518(a)...
(8)(a)
would
not
provide
an
exclusionary
principle.
that's
right.
now,
of
course,
delays
in
sealing
can
result
in
making
the
burden
of
authentication
more
difficult
if
in
fact,
as
in
this
case,
the
claim
is
made
that
there
was
tampering
with
the
tapes
and
the
government
has
to
come
in
and
rebut
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
any
claim
of
tampering.
that's
what
we
did.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
intended
the
immediate
sealing
to
do
exactly
that,
your
honor.
they
have...
they
had
a
ruling
that
the
evidence
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history...
they
said,
we
want
to
avoid
arguments
on
this
point,
we
want
you
to
seal
it
immediately.
but
the
question
is
what
happens
if
you
don't.
and
we
submit
that
congress
did
not
say
that
any
time
you
don't
seal
immediately,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
and
no
court
has
so
held.
the
rule
does
not
apply
across
the
board.
what
congress
is
saying
is,
look,
seal
immediately.
if
you...
if
you
have
not
sealed
and
if
there's
no
seal
there,
we'll...
we'll
have
one
narrow
provision
in
which
you
will
not
be...
simply
not
be
allowed
to
argue
that
the
tapes
should
be
admitted
and
that
is
where
you
don't
have
either
a
seal
or
a
satisfactory
explanation
for
a
seal.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
of
course.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right
and...
and--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--he
did
approve
it
because
this
was...
these
were
both
(a)
relatively
short
delays.
it
wasn't
the
case
of
a
seal
which
was
imposed
two
days
before
trial.
the
parade
of
horribles
that
defendants--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
if
the
judge
is
willing
to
seal
it
under
those
circumstances--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--our
position
would
be
the
statute
would
fall
out.
it
wouldn't
be
applicable.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
under
2518(8)(a)
that's...
that's...
that's
true.
now,
it
may
be--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
but
it
would
have
to...
we
would
nonetheless
still
have
to
establish
the
authenticity
of
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
if...
if
the
judge
did
that,
i
suspect,
depending
on
the
strength
of
the...
of
the
allegations--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that's
right.
but
we
would
still
have
to
establish
authenticity
under
the
federal
rules
and
under
the
rules
set
forth
by
the
courts
with
respect
to
tape-recorded
evidence,
which
is
a...
a
significant
burden.
it's
just
that
this
particular
provision
would
not
bar--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
it
would
be
inapplicable.
i
think
not
meaningless.
it...
it
would
not...
simply
wouldn't
apply
to
that
set
of
facts.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
that...
we
would
still
have
the
burden,
of
course,
in
the
sense
of
we
would
have
not
complied
with
the
immediate
sealing
requirement.
and
we
would
be
subject,
for
example,
to
contempt,
which
is
found
in
2518(8)(c)...
any
violation
of
the
subsection
is
subject
to
contempt...
so
the
prosecutor--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that
may
be,
although
it's
not
clear
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--how...
how
can
they
challenge
the
authenticity
of
the
tapes?
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
they...
they
made
the
statements
on
the
tapes.
if
they
say,
you
have
got
stuff
on
that
tape
that
i
never
said,
i
have
no
involvement
with
this
robbery,
i
never
said
anything
about
wells
fargo,
i'm
a
complete
stranger
to
this
thing,
and
there's
my
voice
saying
in
a
spliced
form
that
i
did
this.
i'm
going
to
challenge
that,
number
one,
by
showing
that
there
is
no
valid
chain
of
custody
and,
number
two,
i'm
going
to
bring
my
expert
in
and
i'm
going
show
that
those
words
were
stuck
together
like
the
pieces
cut
out
of
the
newspaper
in
effect
and
stuck
on
the
tape.
that's
the
way
it
happens.
the
person
whose
voice
is
intercepted
is
in
a
good
position
to
know
if
he
said
those
things.
and--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
the
seal
is
an
aid
in
that
it
establishes
a
better
chain
of
custody
than
if
there
was
no
seal.
what
it
does
is...
and
the
reason
that
it
is
really
welcome
to
the
government,
is
something
the
government
has
an
incentive
to
put
on...
is
that
it
takes
care
of
everything
from
the
moment
that
seal
is...
is
put
on,
when
the
judge
puts
it
on,
to
the
moment
of
trial.
because
when
the
judge
rips
the
seal
off
and
it's
still
intact,
assuming
somebody
hasn't
really
gone
wild
and
gone
out
and
gotten
the
seal
off,
steamed
it
off
or
something
and
replaced
it...
you
always
take
that
risk.
but
basically
you
have
a
very
solid
chain
of
custody.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
they
generally
will
have
made
copies
in
advance
and
they
will
be
working
from
the
copies.
or
if
they
haven't,
they
can
go
to
the
court--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--oh,
yes,
that's...
that's
not
infrequent
and
the
courts
have
approved
that...
that
procedure.
now...
and
in
fact,
in
some
courts
there...
there
have
been
delays
which
have
been
accepted
as
satisfactory
or
explained
delays
based
on
the
time
taken
to
make
copies.
the
court
can...
the
government
can
also
go
back
to
the
district
court,
as
the
statute
specifically
provides,
and
ask
for
an
order
unsealing
for
a
specific
purpose
and
resealing
so
that
there
isn't
any
strict
prohibition
against
going
back
and
getting
the
tapes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
oh,
sure.
absolutely.
it's
just
an
easier
process,
of
course.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no.
that
has...
has
developed
in
the
courts
of
appeals
and
in
the
second
circuit
as
a
specific
rule
applicable
to
tape-recorded
evidence.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
there
isn't
any
basis
in
the
rule,
your
honor.
what
it
is...
it's
simply...
the
rationale
is
that
tape-recorded
evidence
is
hard
to...
it's
hard
to
tell
whether
it's
authentic
or
not
and,
therefore,
we're
going
to
put
on
the
government
a
particularly
high
burden.
it's
really
created
as
a
sort
of
common
law
evidentiary
rule.
now,
if
push
came
to
shove,
the
question
of
whether
rule
901
compels
that,
i
think
probably
not.
but
that
certainly
is
the
rule
that's
followed
by...
by
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
with
respect
to
authenticity.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
it
does,
and...
and
i
think
the
better
argument...
i
think
those
courts
of
appeals
that
have
held
clear
and
convincing
evidence
as
a
requirement
may
well
be
wrong,
and
that's
not
the
issue
before
the
court.
in
this
case,
the
district
court,
following
established
second
circuit
precedent,
found
the
tapes
in
question...
or
at
least
the
tapes
that
he
addressed...
he
didn't
address
all
of
the
tapes...
but
the
ones
he
did
address,
he
found
to
be
genuine
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
following
second
circuit
precedent.
now,
you...
you
could
look
at
the
legislative
history
as
well
and
find
that
while
it's
not
dispositive...
this
is
not
legislative
history
that
simply
solves
the
problem
if
it
ever
does...
but
the
legislative
history
is,
i
think,
instructive
in
that
it...
it...
there
is
no
reference,
no
suggestion
that
the
congress
was
trying
to
deal
not
only
with
the
absence
of
a
seal
but
also
with
delays
in
sealing.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
can
to
a
little--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
can
do
a
little
better
than
that.
i
think
the
dog
not
only
didn't
bark
but
he
sort
of
licked
at
the
hand
of
the
master.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
in
this
case...
let
me
just
run
through
what...
what
we
have.
the
statute
really
had
its
origin
in
the
task
force
report
on
organized
crime
in
1970...
67
of
president
johnson's
commission
on
law
enforcement
and
the
administration
of
justice.
there
was
a
draft
statute
in
the
appendix
of
that
report
which
turns
out
to
be
very
close
to
what
ultimately
became
title
iii.
and
in
particular,
the
draft
provision
that
we're
dealing...
or
the
provision
we're
dealing
with
here
was
almost
exactly
word
for
word
the
draft
provision
that
showed
up
in
that
report.
and
the
language
used
to
describe
that
draft
provision
was...
at
page
103
of
the
report...
was
that
after
saying
that
the
seals...
the
tapes
should
be
sealed
when
the
interception
is
terminated,
"the
seals
should
be
a
prerequisite
for
admission
unless
the
satisfactory
showing
could
be
made
for
its
absence.
"
the
seal
should
be
a
prerequisite.
no
reference
to
delay...
just
the
seal.
again,
in
the
senate
report,
we
have,
"the
presence
of
the
seal,
noted
above,
the
judicial
seal,
is
intended
to
be
a
prerequisite
for
use
unless
a
satisfactory
explanation
can
be
made
to
the
judge.
"
then
in
a
statement
on...
that
was
put
into
the
record
prior
to
the
enactment
of
title
iii
by
senator
scott,
a
shorthand
description
of
the
provisions
of
the
bill
said,
"unless
under
seal
or
no
satisfactory
explanation
of
its
absence,
the
information
contained
in
such
recording
may
not
be
used.
"
not
only
is
there
no
hint
of
delay,
but
we're
talking
about
unless
the
seal
is
there.
and
there
is
no
reference
to
the
provided
for
language,
which
you
would
think
would
show
up
if
they
really
were
focusing
on
that
language
to
trigger
the
requirement...
to
trigger
the
delay
factor.
now
the
respondents
argue
that
there
are
policy
reasons--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
you...
you
could.
you
could
interpret
it
that
way.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
if
you
interpret
it
that
way.
my
submission
is
not
that
this
legislative
history
is
a
bell
ringer
and
i
can
sit
down.
but
i
think
it's...
it's
helpful
and
i
think
it
does
a
little
more
than
say
there
is
no
reference
to
delay.
it...
it
suggests
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
seal
that's
absent.
that's
the
language.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
they
certainly
wanted
it
on
there
right
away
but
there
is
a
reason
for
the
seal
whenever
it
goes
on,
which
is
that
even
if
it's
two
weeks
late
or
three
weeks
late
or
six
weeks
late,
it...
it
cuts
off
the
problem
of...
of
risks
of...
of
lack
of
authenticity
from
whatever
point
forward
that
it's
put
on.
in
this
case,
for
example,--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
its...
its
function
is
to
establish
authenticity.
it
does
that,
depending
on
whenever
it's
put
on
with
respect
to
timing.
that's
true.
but
it's
function
is--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
yeah.
or
at
least
make
it
harder.
and
one
could
always
claim
again
that
somebody
had
steamed
off
the
seal
but--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
it
may
well
be
no
good.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
would...
certainly
not.
it
would
serve
no
purpose.
i
would
think
a
judge
being
asked
to
put
a
seal
on
the
day
before
trial
would
simply
laugh
at
the
person
who
walked
into
his
or
her
office
with
that
request.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
certainly.
in
time...
if
you...
if
you
come
in
on
the
day
before
the
trial
with
a
request
for
sealing--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--this
was...
this
was
not
the
administration's
bill
and,
your
honor,
i
can't
tell
you
whether
there
was
any
objection.
i
doubt
it...
i
can't
tell
you,
but
i
doubt
it--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--because
it
was
not
a
provision
that
was
at
all
controversial
and
it
went
right
through
all
the
versions
of
the
statute.
the
statute
went
through
several
versions
and...
this...
this
provision
stayed
unchanged
throughout.
i
don't
remember
in
the
department's
commentary
that
there
was
any
reference
to
it.
i
believe
not.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
question
of
whether,
assuming
that
delays
are
covered,
there
was
a
satisfactory
explanation,
as
the
statute
provides,
in
this
case
for
the
delay
or,
even
assuming
that
satisfactory
explanation
means
something
like
good
cause,
whether
there
was
in
fact
good
cause
in
this
case
for
the
delay.
now,
our
position
with
respect
to
the
satisfactory
explanation
requirement
is
that
you
must
do
the
following.
you
must
give
a
credible
explanation
to
a
court
of
why
there
was
a
delay.
and
the
question
is
then,
well,
what
more
must
you
do?
we
say
that
the
more
that's
required
turns
on
the
interpretation
of
the
word
"satisfactory",
which
is
a
somewhat
difficult
term
to
handle.
it's
not
clear
what
it
means.
you
could
interpret
it
to
mean
simply
that
an
accurate
description,
a
description
that
satisfies
the
court
that
this
is
an
accurate
description
of
what
happened
even
if
the...
what
happened
was
that
the
tapes
got
tampered
with.
but
we
think
it
requires
more
than
that.
in
light
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
we
think
that
what
it
requires
is
that
you
explain
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
judge,
that
you...
that
the
tapes
have
not
been,
in
fact,
tampered
with,
that
they
are
pristine.
and
once
the
judge
can
sit
back
and
conclude
that
that's
the
condition
of
the
tapes,
then
that
constitutes
a
satisfactory
explanation.
now,
this--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it's...
it's
not
very
different.
it
would
be
a
very
similar
kind
of
showing.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
we
have
to
have
a
credible
explanation
and
that
satisfies
the
explanation
part.
and
then
the
question
is
what
does
satisfactory
mean.
and
we
submit
that
if
the
judge
is
persuaded
by
our...
by
our
explanation
that
the
tapes
have
not
been
tampered
with...
tinkered
with...
then
that's
satisfactory.
that's
our
interpretation.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
william
c.
bryson
oh,
well,
our
explanation
was
there
was
one
legal
error
made,
arguably.
we'll
concede
for
present
purposes
there
was
a
legal
error
made.
the
lawyer
whose--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
we
have
to...
we
have
to
show
an
explanation.
we
came
forward
with
an
explanation.
our
explanation
was
we
made
a
legal
error,
arguably,
in
interpreting
the
word
"extension".
mr.
william
c.
bryson
and
that's
why
we
delayed.
now,
the
question
is
is
that
a
satisfactory
explanation.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
now,
it's
satisfactory
in
one
sense
that
it
explains--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--accurately,
truthfully
and
with
no
doubt
what
happened.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
does
applies
to
our
coming
forward
and
telling
the
judge
why
there
was
a
detail...
a
delay
in
the
sealing.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i...
we
think--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
can
be...
in
a
sense
it
is
because
we
say
that
it's
excusable
if--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--in
fact
it
had
no
consequence
in
resulting
in
the
alteration
of
the
tapes--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--as
opposed
to
being
a
good
reason
or
a
good
cause.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
and--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
correct.
and
the
reason
is
because
if
the
judge...
that
is
the
truthful
explanation.
now,
an
attorney
may
come
in
and
say
this
attorney
was
a
rogue
attorney...
this
is
not
the
case
in
this
case...
but
some
attorney,
well,
just
decided
not
follow
the
statute,
said
to
heck
with
the
statute,
i'm
not
going
to
follow
it,
i'm
not
going
to
seal,
it's
too
much
trouble.
and
we
come
in
and
we
explain
that
to
the
judge
and
we
say
this--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
was
a
mistake
to
have...
nope.
well,
not
only
is
nobody
perfect,
but
some
people
are
just
irresponsible.
and
this
was
an
irresponsible
act.
that's
our
explanation.
now,
question:
is
this
the
satisfactory
explanation?
we
submit
in
light
of
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
it
is
if
we
can
further
show
that
the
tapes
have
not
been
tampered
with.
this
is
a
chain...
essentially
a
chain
of
custody
rule.
suppose
that
we
were
dealing
with
nothing
more
than
a
rule
that
said
establish
chain
of
custody
from
place
a
through
place
z
or
provide
a
satisfactory
explanation
for
what's
missing,
we
would--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--there
is
a
very
good
reason
for
a
seal.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
we
would.
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
but,
of
course,
we'd
have
to
go
through
a
lengthy
hearing,
as
we
did
in
this
case.
there's
no
incentive
for
us
to
do
that.
if
we
did...
if
it
did
come
to
that,
yes,
i
think
that's
right.
but
the
evidence--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no,
because
i
think
what
happens,
your
honor,
is
that
if
you
have
a
chain
of
custody
established
in
part
with
the
aid
of
the
seal,
the
judicial
seal--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
in
that
case,
you'd
have
to
go
through
a
long
hearing
in
all
likelihood,
if
there
is
any
colorable
showing
made
that
anything
may
have
happened
to
the
tapes
in
the
meantime.
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
we
do.
[laughter]
let
me...
let
me
move
without
further
delay
to
the
fall-back
position.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
and
i'm
going
to
give
you
that...
you
haven't
yet,
but
you're
going
get
it
right
now.
i'm
going
to
explain.
what
happen
was
in
this
case
is
the
attorney
construed
the
term
"extensions"
to
mean,
any...
if
you're
following
a
particular
target
through
the
series
of
wiretaps
and
you
go
from
house
a
to
house
b
to
house
c,
then
the
wiretap
at
house
b
is
an
extension
of
the
wiretap
at
house
a
and
the
wiretap
at
house
c
is
an
extension
of
the
wiretap
at
house
b.
that's
the
way
he
applied
the
term
with
respect
to
the
key
interceptions
in
this
case.
he
had
a
somewhat
broader
concept
of
extension
in
general
in
which
he
felt
that
any...
any--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
it
may
well
be
wrong--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--but
that
was
his...
that
was
his
conclusion.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that's
right.
that's
right.
but
he...
the
reason
was
because--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--because
he
didn't
think
it
was
necessary
to
put
it
on
at
that
time
because
he
felt
that
the
extension--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that's...
that's
the
question,
your
honor.
it's
not
clear
that
the
statute
meant
that
he
had
to
put
the
seal
on
at
the
moment
that
the
interceptions
terminated
because
you
can
put
the
seal
on
after
the
extensions
of
the
interceptions
terminate.
and
he
construed
the
term
"extensions"
to
apply
to
any
of
the
related
wiretaps
in
the
same
investigation,
particularly,
as
in
this
case,
when
you
are
following
a
particular
individual
from
place...
place
to
place.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
order--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
it
means
order
or
extensions.
not
period,
but
order
or
extensions.
the
district
court
found
he
acted
in
good
faith.
he
was
negligent.
the
district
court
thought
it
was
a
legal
error
and
he
shouldn't
have
made
it,
but
that
there
was
no
intentional...
he
did
not
intentionally
ignore
the
law
or
deliberately
fail
to
seal.
it
was
the
result
of
a
misunderstanding
and
that
the
only
basis
on
which
the
district
court
suppressed
was
that
the
delay
was
simply
too
long.
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
he
had
really
disregarded
the
sensitive
nature
of
the
activities
undertaken
but
still
did
not
upset
the
district
court's
findings
of
good
faith.
and
in
this
case,
we
submit
that
because
this
was
a
single
legal
error
which
we
think,
in
light
of
the
second
circuit
cases
such
as
principie
and
scafidi,
was
an
understandable
legal
error,
if
it
was
an
error,
then
there
should
not
be
exclusion
in
this
case
because
it
was
satisfactorily
explained.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
i
do,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
point
i'd
like
to
make
quickly
is
each
of
the
courts
already
requires
us
to
show,
as
part
of
a
satisfactory
explanation,
that
there
was
no
tampering.
so,
there's
not
going
to
be
any
great
increase
in
the
numbers
of
these
hearings
since
that's
already
a
requirement
that
we
have
to
satisfy.
the
question
is
do
we
have
to
do
more
by
way
of
establishing
a
satisfactory
explanation
for
delay.
the
second
point
is
the
gigante
case,
which
is
the
only
other
case
in
which
there
has
been
suppression
at
the
court
of
appeals
level
that
i
am
aware
of,
was
a
case
in
which
we
had
no
explanation
for
the
delay.
it
wasn't
a
satisfactory
explanation
case.
and
third,
and
most
important,
the...
teasing
out
the
argument
that,
well,
you
have
to
look
at
how
long
the
delay
was,
why
the
delay
was,
and
that
there
was
a
pattern
of
delays,
in
this
case
in
quite
unfair
because
there
was
one
legal
mistake,
the
construction
of
the
term
"extension".
that's
what
resulted
in
the
long
delay.
every
day
that
passed
was
not
compounding
the
felony
because
this
was
somebody
who
was...
believed
he
was
secure
in
his
construction
of
the
term
"extension".
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
they...
they
thought
he
was
wrong.
now,
the
district
court
did
not
find
gross
negligence.
the
district
court
did
find
negligence.
but
we
would
submit
that
where
the
second
circuit
in
one
of
its
own
opinions,
in
the
principie
case,
had
found
that
moving
from
place
a
when
the
target
moves
to
place
b
and
getting
another
order
for
place
b,
when
that
is
an
extension,
his
construction
of
the
statute
was
not
unreasonable.
it
couldn't
be
unreasonable
because
the
very
court
that
ruled
in
this
case
had
previously
said
that
that's
what
extension
means.
now,
the
court
distinguished
that
case
in
this
case
by
saying,
well,
but
that
was
the
word
2518(8)(d)
dealing
with
inventory
service.
and
also,
there
was
no
gap
between
the
two
orders.
therefore,
that
could
be
an
extension
and
this,
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
suppose,
would
be...
would
be
an
extension.
but
it...
the
word
has
to
mean
the
same
thing
in
both
subsections
of
the
same
provision,
and
we
submit,
therefore,
that
it
wasn't
unreasonable
for
him
to
draw
that
conclusion.
thank
you.
