justice
o'connor
mr.
bryson,
the
offense
occurred
in
1983?
justice
o'connor
and
has
the
defendant
ever
been
brought
to
trial?
justice
o'connor
but,
at
least,
mr.
ojeda
rios
has
never
been
tried?
justice
o'connor
and
you...
you
take
the
position
that
the
speedy
trial
act
does
not
preclude
trial
at
this
junction?
justice
o'connor
the
statutory
provision
under
which
the
exclusion
was
made
says
basically
that
the
presence
of
the
seal--
justice
o'connor
--provided
for
by
this
subsection.
that's
the
language
used.
justice
o'connor
doesn't
that
phrase
have
the
effect
of
incorporating
the
timing
requirement
provided
for
in
this
subsection?
justice
o'connor
it
certainly
could
be
said
to
do
so.
i
mean,
i
am
concerned
with
the
language
of
the
provision
itself.
justice
o'connor
well,
in
your
view,
there
would
be
no
remedy
for
an
unexcused
delay
in
sealing?
justice
o'connor
well,
congress
may
have
intended
some
kind
of
prophylactic
remedy
here
in
the
sense
that
if
a...
if
a
seal
is
provided
immediately,
you're
just
going
to
eliminate
the
risk
of
much
tampering.
justice
o'connor
but
even
so,
the
statute
does
go
on,
when
it
talks
about
the
use
of
the
evidence,
to
say
that
there
must
be
a
satisfactory
explanation
for
the
absence
of
a
seal.
justice
o'connor
and
you
would
read
it
as
though
it
said
a
satisfactory
explanation
for
noncompliance
with
the
immediate
sealing
requirement.
justice
o'connor
what
is
the
harm
to
your
client
if
the
proof
is
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
tapes
are
authentic
and
accurate?
