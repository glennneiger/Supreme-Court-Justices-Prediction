chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-61,
united
states
against
filiberto
ojeda
rios.
mr.
bryson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
even
if
the
tape
is
sealed,
the
government
has
to
authenticate
it,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
referred
a
moment
ago
to
the...
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
of
evidence,
is
that
provided
in
the
rules?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's...
what's
the
basis
for
that
rule?
chief
justice
rehnquist
doesn't...
doesn't
rule
901
provide
the
way
things
shall
be
authenticated?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--how
different...
how
different
is
that
than
the
sort
of
showing
you'd
put
on
simply
to
authenticate
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
does
the
term
"explanation"
apply
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
other...
it's
an
explanation
of
the
delay?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
what
your
position
is?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
reeve.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
critical
language
doesn't
say
immediate
seal,
mr.
reeve.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
contain
the
word
"immediate",
does
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
that's...
well,
that's
what
i
am
asking.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
that...
was
that
argument
made
to
each
of
the
courts
which
you
say
have
not
held
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
gigante
is
also
a
second
circuit
case
like
this
one?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
gist
is
the...
if
the
defendant
is
not
prejudiced
by
the
shortness
of
notice
in
the
section
you
are
talking
about?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr.
reeve,
what
part
does
the
satisfactory
explanation
requirement
of
the
section
we're
talking
about
play
under
your
analysis
of
the
seal
requirement?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
in...
in
your
view,
the
statute
doesn't
just
ask
why.
i
mean,
that
would
authorize
the
government's
view.
just
come
in
and
give
a
frank
explanation
of
all
the
things
that
went
wrong
and
it
asks
for...
for
first
why,
and
then,
is
it
your
position,
was
this
default
excusable?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is...
is
that--
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what...
what...
theory
of
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
for
what
purpose?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
wasn't
it
for
the
purpose
of
making
sure
there
wasn't
any
tampering?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
reeve.
mr.
bryson,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
the
case
is
submitted.
