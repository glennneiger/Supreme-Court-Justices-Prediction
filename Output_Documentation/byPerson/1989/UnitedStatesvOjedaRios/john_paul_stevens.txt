justice
stevens
yeah,
but
what
if
it
was?
what
if
it
was?
what
if
a
judge
said...
you
did...
just
like
marking
exhibit,
you
ought
to
mark
your
exhibit
before
you
hand
it
to...
up
for
evidence.
you
didn't
get
the
seal
on
these;
here,
you'd
better
seal
it
right
now.
justice
stevens
and
that
would
make
it
admissible.
justice
stevens
so
it's
entirely
up
to
the
judge
to...
to
let
anything
in
of
this
kind
he
wants
to?
justice
stevens
well,
also
under
the
other...
it
doesn't
violate
the
other
section.
justice
stevens
well,
maybe
the
judge
says,
well,
i
don't
think
the
government
agents
aren't
going
to
use
phoney
evidence.
i
don't
even
have
to
look
at
this.
i'll
presume
they
were
fair.
justice
stevens
well,
it
would
comply
with
statute.
it
would
comply
with
the
statute
under
your
reading.
justice
stevens
this
particular
provision
would
be
totally
meaningless.
justice
stevens
it
would
not
impose
any
burden
at
all
if
the
judge
was
willing
to
seal
it.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
when
the
judge
is
willing
to
seal
it
he
doesn't
have
to
hold
you
in
contempt.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
how
does
someone
challenging
authenticity
go
about
proving
it?
i
mean,
say
you
have
custody
of
tape
for
three
or
four
months
and
you
get
somebody
on
the
witness
stand
that
says,
i
don't
know
anything
that
ever
happened,
it
was
sitting
in
the
drawer
all
the
time.
how
can
anybody
ever
challenge
that
testimony?
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
but
couldn't
you
also
interpret
that
history
as
saying
they're
assuming
the
seal
wouldn't
be
there
unless
it
were
put
on
immediately,
as
the
statute
requires?
justice
stevens
and
if
you
do
interpret
it
that
way,
then
it
adds
up
to
nothing.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
there
is
any
purpose
for
the
seal
other
than
to
be
sure
that
it
was
affixed
in
a
timely
manner?
isn't
that
the
only
reason
they
wanted
the
seal
is
to
get
it
on
their
right
away?
justice
stevens
so
its...
its
only
function
is
a
temporal
function,
really.
i
mean--
justice
stevens
--it's
a
different...
a
question
of
when
it
gets
on
is...
is
the
only
thing
that
has
it
serve
any
statutory
purpose.
justice
stevens
well,
it's
to
prevent
any
post-sealed
questions
of
authenticity--
justice
stevens
--from
being
raised.
justice
stevens
where
is
that
reproduced?
is
it
in
your
brief,
in
the
appendix
somewhere?
justice
stevens
no,
we
have
one
somewhere.
justice
stevens
well,
isn't
that
an
ex
parte
proceeding?
justice
stevens
isn't
that
an
ex
parte
proceeding?
it's
ex
parte.
justice
stevens
surely
you
wouldn't
be
fighting
about
whether
he--
