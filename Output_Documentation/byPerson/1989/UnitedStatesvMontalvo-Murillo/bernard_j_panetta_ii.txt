mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
respondent's
position
that
this
statute,
as
a
text,
that
the
intent
of
congress
is
manifest
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
that
the
language
is
clear
and
unambiguous.
if
the
government
had
followed
it
in
this
case,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
and
the
problems
that
the
government
suggest
arises,
when
the
statute
is
not
followed.
if
this
court
tells
other
courts,
tells
the
government,
tells
defendants
that
the
language
is
manifest...
is
mandatory,
the
problems
won't
arise.
if
the
government
in
chicago,
at
mr.
montalvo's
initial
appearance,
had
moved
for
a
continuance,
stating
that
it
needed
to
remove
mr.
montalvo
back
to
new
mexico,
that
more
time
than
three
days
would
have
been
required
to
hold
the
hearing,
and
the
court
there
would
have
been
satisfied
that
the
government
had
established
good
cause,
we
wouldn't
be
here.
the
government
did
not
choose
to
do
that.
the
government
did
not
choose
to
bring
mr.
montalvo
before
a
magistrate
in
new
mexico,
which
is
probably
the
primary
source
of
the
confusion.
he's
arrested
on
the
8th;
he
is
taken
to
the
very
building
in
las
cruces
where
the
magistrate's
courtroom
is,
to
talk
with
the
dea
for
a
period
of
time
about
his
cooperation.
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
the
magistrate
is
a
resident
of
las
cruces
and
he
is
always
there.
when
the
government
needs
to
get
a
search
warrant,
it
calls
the
magistrate's
office.
the
magistrate
makes
himself
available
to
sign
those
warrants.
so
there
is
someone
there
that
is
available
if
the
government
requests
that
they
be
available
and
explains
that
there
is
a
necessity
for
it.
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
chief
judge
bratton
used
to
live
in
albuquerque.
he
lives
in
las
cruces,
and
he
has
moved
back
to
las
cruces.
so
chief
judge
bratton
is
available.
if
it
were
an
emergency,
if
the
government
needed
to
go
before
a
district
court
judge,
chief
judge
bratton
lives
in
las
cruces.
in
this
instance,
the
government
chose
to
take
mr.
montalvo
to
chicago.
there's
no
dispute
that
the
government
moved
to
detain
him.
all
they
had
to
do
at
that
time
was
say
we
need
more
time.
the
government,
to
suggest
that
the
burden
should
shift
to
mr.
montalvo,
to
announce
to
the
court
that
i
need
a
swift
hearing,
seems
to
me
to
be
a
bit
ludicrous
in
the
sense
that
mr.
montalvo
is
unrepresented,
sitting
in
jail
in
las
cruces,
new
mexico.
now,
just
exactly
how
was
he
supposed
to
notify
the
court
that
he
is
entitled
to
a
speedy
hearing?
counsel
was
appointed
finally
on
the
15th;
our
office
is
retained
on
the
16th.
the
magistrate
in
las
cruces
and
my
office
was
unaware
that
the
government
had
moved
to
detain
mr.
montalvo
in
chicago.
we
objected
to
the
court
holding
any
detention
hearing
at
all
because
the
government
had
not
complied
with
the
statute
as
far
as
we
understood.
the
united
states
attorney,
there
in
court,
never
advised
the
court...
never
advised
us
that
such
was
the
case.
to
suggest--
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
--most
respectfully,
i
don't
think
that's
the
issue
at
all,
as
to
what
harm
was
done.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not,
if
you
follow
the
government's
position,
you're
telling
congress
you've
made
mandatory
language
here.
we
don't
have
to
follow
it.
if
you're
going
to
use
a
harmless
error
analysis,
you're
telling
congress
when
you
told
us
that
the
hearing
had
to
be
held
at
the
initial
appearance,
you
didn't
mean
that
because
it
doesn't
have
to
be
held
at
the
initial
appearance.
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
if
the
act
is
enforced
according
to
its
plain
meaning,
my
client
has
the
relief
that
he
requested.
he
cannot
be
detained--
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
--had
the
facts
changed
and
had
the
government
had
the
hearing
in
a
timely
fashion,
my
client
would
have
been
held.
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
there
are
lots
of
other
people
though
that
have
been
held
for
a
longer
period
of
time
that
would
not
be
held.
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
if
i
understand
your
question,
if
the
government...
to
dismiss
the
complaint--
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
--yes,
sir.
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
i
misspoke.
i
am
not
saying
that
mr.
montalvo
should
have
been
released.
what
i
am
saying
is,
that
he
could
not
have
been
preventively
detained.
the
courts
could
have
said,
you
have
to
remain
in
a
halfway
house,
you
have
a
curfew,
you
have
a
$100,000
bond.
mr.
montalvo
couldn't
make
the
bond;
he
has
to
stay
in
jail.
there
are
lots
of
conditions
that
the
court
could
have
set.
what
i
am
saying
is--
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
--the
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
because
the
government
had
not
complied,
mr.
montalvo
had
to
be
released,
if
he
could
meet
the
conditions
set
by
the
district
court.
the
district
court
increased
mr.
montalvo's
bond
from
the
$50,000
bond
set
by
the
magistrate
to
an
$88,000
bond
and
imposed
other
conditions.
and
if
he
could
meet...
comply
with
those
conditions
he
was
to
be
released.
the
district
court
could
have
imposed
other
conditions.
mr.
montalvo
may
not
have
been
able
to
make
the
$88,000
bond.
in
this
case,
he
was
able
to
meet
the
conditions
set
by
the
district
court,
and
he
was
released.
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
i
suggest
that
the
remedy
is
implicit
in
the
mandatory
language,
as
we've
tried
to
analogize
to
rule
4
of
the
appellate
rules
of
procedure.
there's
no
remedy
if
you're
untimely
in
filing
your
appeal.
you
just
can't
file
the
appeal.
just
as
here,
there's
no
remedy,
per
se.
if
the
government
doesn't
file
timely,
it
cannot
move
to
detain.
it's
not
a
question
of
remedy;
it's
a
question
of
meeting
the
requirements
of
the
statute...
just
as
it's
a
question
of
meeting
the
requirements
of
rule
4.
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
when?
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
the
government,
in
this
case,
since
it
did
not
comply
with
the
statute,
cannot
move
to
detain
without
bond.
it
can
move
to
amend
the
conditions
of
release.
if
mr.
montalvo
violates
conditions
of
release,
it
can
move
to
revoke.
but
in
this
instance,
it
cannot.
in
the
removal
cases,
where--
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
--it
could
have
asked
for
more
serious
conditions.
that's
another
point.
mr.
bryson
says,
well,
the
magistrate
conducted
a
very
brief
hearing.
well,
the
magistrate
wasn't
presenting
the
government's
case;
the
government
was
presenting
its
case
as
to
what
the
facts
were.
and
if
the
government
chose
not
to
put
on
a
strong
enough
case
to
detain
mr.
montalvo,
that
was
the
government's
choosing.
it
wasn't
the
magistrate
that
was
presenting
evidence
at
that
hearing.
in
cases
that
are
cited
in
both
briefs
that
talk
about
waiver
and
that
talk
about
removal
and
talk
about
whether
or
not
you
have
to
move
to
detain
in
the
district
of
arrest
or
in
the
charging
district,
if
this
court
tells
other
courts
that
the
language
is
mandatory
and
has
to
be
followed,
those
problems
no
longer
exist.
if
he's
arrested
in
a
district
other
than
the
charging
district,
the
government
moves
to
detain
at
the
initial
appearance
and
files
a
motion
for
a
continuance
beyond
the
three
days
for
good
cause,
because
he's
got
to
be
removed.
if
someone
comes
in...
the
government
suggested
you
could
sandbag
a
court.
and
says,
don't
worry,
bond's
not
an
issue
here;
we're
not
concerned
about
bond.
the
government
moves
to
detain,
makes
a
proffer,
as
it
can
rightly
do
of
what
its
evidence
is.
if
there's
no
question
about
bond,
the
defense
attorney
doesn't
say
anything,
the
magistrate
finds
that
the
statute
has
been
complied
with,
the
government
has
met
his
burden
and
the
man
is
detained.
there's
no
confusion,
if
the
statute
is
read
the
way
congress
has
written
it.
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
what
the
government
is
saying,
most
respectfully,
is
that
we
don't
have
to
do
what
congress
said.
and
when
we
don't
do
what
congress
said,
say
it's
harmless
error
and
forgive
us.
that's
what
they're
saying.
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
he
is.
but
if
the
language
is
mandatory,
there
isn't
a
remedy.
you
cannot
remedy
an
untimely
hearing.
if
the
hearing
hasn't
been
held
in
a
timely
fashion,
you
cannot
go
back
and
hold
it
in
a
timely
fashion.
if
he
didn't
have
an
attorney,
one
of
the
other
things
that
they
talk
about
in
the
statute...
you
can
go
back
and
give
him
an
attorney
and
rehold
the
hearing.
but
there's
no
way
to
remedy
the
untimely
hearing,
just
as
if
an
appeal
is
filed
out
of
time,
as
in
andre
v.
guste,
a
case
that
we
talk
about
where
the
petitioner
filed
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
he
did
not
appeal.
he
then
refiled
the
same
writ
and
sought
to
appeal.
the
fifth
circuit
said,
you
can't
get
around
the
time
requirements
that
way.
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
you're
absolutely
right.
mr.
bryson
informed
me
of
a
case
that
is
not
cited
in
his
brief,
which
is
brock
v.
pierce
county,
which
had
to
do
with
some
mandatory
language
to
an
agency's
secretary
that
you
shall
act
on
complaints
involving
ceta
funds
within
120
days.
and
he
didn't
act
in
120
days.
and
someone
was
saying...
coming
in
and
saying,
well,
you
no
longer
have
the
power
to
act.
the
language
was
shall.
this
court
said,
well,
that
didn't
mean
that
he
had
to
decide
within
the
120
days.
there,
i
think,
there
were
a
couple
of
differences.
in
that
statute
there
was
no
escape
valve,
if
you
will.
there
was
no
excusable
neglect
like
in
the
appellate
statute.
there
was
no
good
cause
like
in
our
statute.
also,
in
the
legislative
history
of
that
act,
when
the
sponsor
of
the
bill
was
being
questioned
by
one
of
the
congressmen,
he
was
asked,
well,
does
this
mean
that
the
secretary
has
to
rule
within
that
120
days?
he
said,
no.
here,
i
believe,
the
legislative
history
is
clear.
the
congress
had
the
district
of
columbia's
preventive
detention
statute
before
it.
the
preventive
detention
statute
in
the
district
of
columbia
allows
the
government
to
move
at
any
time
to
detain,
not
at
an
individual's
initial
appearance
but
when
the
government
believes
it
should
move
to
detain.
the
second
part
of
that
statute
is
the
same
as
the
one
that
we
have
here,
that
when
they
move
to
detain,
the
government
may
get
a
continuance
of
three
days,
the
defendant
of
five
or,
if
you
can
show
good
cause,
a
further
amount
of
time.
clearly,
the
congress
was
aware
of
that
statute
and
could
have
provided
that
the
government
could
move
to
detain
at
any
time.
it
didn't.
this
court,
in
salerno,
in
upholding
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute,
looked
to
the
protections
that
congress
had
put
in
to
find
that
preventive
detention
was
constitutional.
this
is
one
of
the
very
protections.
if
we
say
that
it's
harmless
not
to
abide
by
them,
does
that
challenge
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
it's
still
constitutional,
if
you
don't
have
to
comply
with
those
conditions?
mr.
bernard
j.
panetta,
ii
but
congress
had
an
opportunity
to
do
otherwise;
it
chose
not
to
do
otherwise.
it
seems
if
the
government
reads
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
and
complies
with
it,
that
this
problem
is
not
going
to
reoccur.
that
the
government
can
move
to
detain.
and
if
there
are
exceptional
circumstances
that
arise
that
require
the
government
to
have
more
time,
they
can
request
more
time.
the
analogy,
i
think,
to
rule
4
is
an
apt
one.
i
believe
that
the
time
limits
within
the
statute
are
jurisdictional
and
mandatory
and
should
be
so
held
by
this
court.
to
do
otherwise,
i
believe,
would
be
to
eviscerate
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
and
to
substitute
this
court's
view
rather
than
the
legislature,
which
has
already
spoken
clearly
and
unambiguously.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
tenth
circuit.
