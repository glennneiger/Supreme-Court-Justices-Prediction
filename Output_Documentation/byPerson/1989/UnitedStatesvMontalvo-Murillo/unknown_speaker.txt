unknown
speaker
is
he
still
a
fugitive?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bryson,
do
you
concede
that
the
government
failed
to
comply
with
the
statute
here?
you
want
us
to
consider
the
case
in
that
posture?
unknown
speaker
certainly
it
might
have
been
contested,
might
it
not--
unknown
speaker
--that
there
was
waiver
or
one
thing
and
another.
unknown
speaker
you
were
going
to
tell
us
of
what
other
possibilities
than
release
are
available.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
this
a
violation
without
relief
or
a
remedy?
unknown
speaker
is
the
only
authority
to
hold
the
authority
that's
set
forth
in
the
act?
unknown
speaker
does
the
court
have
some
inherent
authority
to
hold--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
before
there
was
statute,
was
the
holding
deemed
to
be
by
the
sheriff
or
the
united
states
marshal,
or
was
the
holding...
is
the
holding
by
the
court?
unknown
speaker
if
the
power...
if
the
inherent
power
is
there
anyway,
why
would
you
need
a
statute
to
provide
for
a
period
for
when
you're
going
to
be
held?
unknown
speaker
mr.
bryson,
on
this
period
when
he
should
have
made
the
motion,
was
that...
what
time
is
that
in
relation
to
this
trip
to
chicago?
unknown
speaker
didn't
you
say
the
waiver--
unknown
speaker
--he
should
have
made
the
motion
in
chicago?
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--he
wasn't
settled
down.
he
was
in
transit,
wasn't
he?
he
was...
well,
no,
he
was
flown.
sometimes
they
put
them
on
the
bus
and
it
can
take
awhile.
he
was
actually
flown
back
to
new
mexico,
and
he
got
back
that
night.
so
he
was
back
in
new
mexico
on
friday
night,
on
the
10th.
but
i
mean,
i
don't
think
he
should
be
responsible
for
the
time
that
the
government
was
carrying
him
around
the
country.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
wanted
to
know,
how
much
time?
unknown
speaker
could
he
have
made
the
motion
the
week
before?
unknown
speaker
could
he
have
made
that
motion
the
week
while
he
was
waiting
to
go
to
chicago?
unknown
speaker
well,
who
told
him
that?
nobody
told
him
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
anybody
required
to
tell
him
that?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
sort
of
a
vague
right,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
did
he
have
retained
counsel
here
and
there?
unknown
speaker
did
he
have
retained
counsel?
unknown
speaker
did
he
have
retained
counsel
in
chicago?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
you...
on
february
16th,
when
the
hearing
was
first
set,
and
they
didn't
go
ahead
or...
was
that
when
it
was
set
or
when
they
agreed
to
have
it
four
or
five
days
later?
unknown
speaker
yes.
when
we're
back
in
new
mexico.
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
not
in
his
presence?
unknown
speaker
that
was
just
between
the
drug
enforcement
agent
and
the
magistrate?
unknown
speaker
and
the
magistrate
suggested
we
put
it
over
until
the
21st?
unknown
speaker
now,
if
on
that
date--
unknown
speaker
--he
had
said,
i
want
a
hearing
now,
would
they
have
had
to
give
him...
either
give
him
the
hearing
and
let
him
go?
unknown
speaker
but
they
could
not
have
granted
a
continuance
for
five
days,
if
the
government
had
asked
for
it.
unknown
speaker
and
he
went
from
the
16th
to
the
21st,
and
say
the
magistrate
says,
i
cannot
decide
this
until
i
get
a
report,
which
is
up
in
chicago
or
someplace,
which
cannot
be
produced
until
the
21st.
we're
just
handcuffed
until
then.
could
he
have
insisted...
would
he
have
had
a
statutory
right
to
release?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
told
justice
blackmun
he
would,
that
that's
exactly
the
remedy.
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
could
continue
the
hearing
for
five
days?
unknown
speaker
and
he
couldn't
have
demanded
that
the
hearing
be
started
and
conducted
continuously?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i'm
trying
to
get...
to
think
through
your
answer
to
justice
blackmun
that,
really,
there
are
lots
of
good
remedies
here.
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
lots
of
good
ways
to
avoid
letting
him
go.
now,
maybe
that
makes
good
sense
and
that's--
unknown
speaker
--but
under
your
view,
mr.
bryson,
if
a
defendant
is
held
beyond
this
time,
that
there
is
a
violation
of
the
first-appearance
rule.
and
it
later
turns
out
at
a
hearing
he
should
have
been
held--
unknown
speaker
--he
has
suffered
no
injury.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
turns
out
he
shouldn't
have
been
held,
then
he
has
suffered
injury.
he
has
been
confined
a
certain
number
of
days
that
he
shouldn't.
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it,
the
government's
answer
is
there's
just
no
remedy
for
this.
unknown
speaker
it
would
also
be
true
if
he
were
innocent,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question
about
the
sequence?
the
magistrate...
and
am
i
correct,
the
magistrate
originally
determined
that
he
should
be
released
on
bond?
unknown
speaker
and
then
there
was
a
couple
of
days
taken
to
take
the
matter
to
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
could
he
be
detained
during
the
twoday
appeal
to
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
bryson,
you
talk
about
how
the
strong
case
is.
apparently
it
didn't
persuade
the
magistrate.
unknown
speaker
so
i
mean,
we
have
to
kind
of
assume
it
must
be...
reasonable
judges
could
have
decided
it
either
way.
unknown
speaker
i
wonder
what
he
would
have
gotten
if
they'd
delivered
the
drugs
in
chicago.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
panetta,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
resident
judge
in
las
cruces
at
all
times,
mr.
panetta?
unknown
speaker
if
you
want
to
ask
the
district
court
to
review
something...
the
magistrate's...
don't
you...
what?
you
go
to
albuquerque?
unknown
speaker
mr.
panetta,
what
do
you
say
to
the
government's
main
argument?
i
don't
think
they're
contesting
that
they
made
a
mistake
here;
that
they
didn't
follow
the
proper
procedures.
but
i
think
their
basic
argument
is
no
harm,
no
foul.
that
had
there
been
a
prompt
hearing,
the
result
of
that
hearing
would
have
been
exactly
what
happened
anyway.
he
was
held.
so
your
client
is
now
coming
in
and
saying,
oh,
you
know,
i've
been
harmed
because
i've
been
held.
and
the
government
is
saying,
even
if
you
had
gotten
your
hearing,
you
would
have
been
held.
so
what
harm
has
been
done
to
your
client?
unknown
speaker
you're
not
seeking
relief
for
your
client?
you're
not
seeking
to
get
something
for
your
client
that
he
was
entitled
to?
you're
rather
seeking
just
a
rule
that
will
cause
the
act
to
be
enforced
more
rigorously?
unknown
speaker
no.
your
client
would
have
been
in
exactly
the
same
position
he's
in
now.
he
would
have
been...
well,
i
mean
except
for
the
fact
that
he's,
you
know,
not
been
held.
but
he
would
have
been
held.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
government
knew
it
was
violating
the
rule
and
just
turned
your
client
loose
and
then
rearrested
him
in
a
couple
of
days?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
you
want...
you
say
he
should
be
released?
unknown
speaker
and
forever?
is
he
free
of
the
charge
that
might
have
been
brought
against
him?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
did
the
court
do?
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
rule...
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
panetta,
you
say
that
the
statute
ought
to
be
enforced
as
it's
written,
but
it
doesn't
provide
what
should
be
the
remedy
if
the
government
doesn't
comply
with
the
statute.
so...
according
has
obviously
got
to
contribute
something
to
the
solution.
unknown
speaker
you
can
no
longer
move
to
retain
without
bond?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
[inaudible].
unknown
speaker
it
can
move...
it
can
say,
we
can't
move
to
hold
without
bond,
but
we
can
certainly
ask
for
severe
restraints
if
he's
released.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
not
clear
to
me
the
government
is
saying
that
this
isn't
mandatory.
it's
just
saying
that
there's
no
remedy
if
the
mandatory...
that
there's
no
remedy
of
relief...
release,
if
the
mandatory
provisions
are
violated.
if
there's
refusal
to
hold
a
hearing,
you
go
to
a
district
judge,
a
circuit
judge,
get
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
tell
the
judges
to
follow
the
law.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
different
from
saying
the
language
is
not
mandatory.
the
government's...
the
judge,
if
he
refuses
to
hold
a
hearing
within
the
time
prescribed
is
in
violation
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
time
requirements
in
connection
with
an
appeal
have
been
construed
by...
excuse
me,
construed
by
the
courts
as
"jurisdictional".
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
other
time
requirements
in
the
law
that
aren't
construed
as
jurisdictional.
that
you
have
fallen
short
of
a
statutory
standard,
but
the
remedy
is
not
necessarily
that
you
simply
evaporate
into
thin
air.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
panetta.
mr.
bryson,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
a
requirement
now
that
if
bail
is
set
it
must
be
bail
that
the
defendant
can
meet?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
a
dramatic
change.
unknown
speaker
xxx
$88,000--
--that's
not
free...
i
mean,
$88,000.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
