mr.
william
c.
bryson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
violation
of
the
time
limits
found
in
the
pretrial
detention
statute
require
the
release
of
a
defendant
who
is
subject
to
pretrial
detention,
no
matter
how
strong
the
case
for
detention
may
be.
the
case
comes
to
the
court
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
but
the
facts,
briefly
stated,
are
as
follows:
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--he
is
still
a
fugitive
as
of
this
day,
your
honor.
we
have
not
rearrested
him.
the
defendant
was
picked
up
at
a
border
patrol
checkpoint
some
distance
from
the
mexican
border
in
new
mexico,
and
found
to
be
carrying
72
pounds
of
cocaine
in
his
truck.
he
chatted
with
the
border
patrol
officers
at
that
time
and
agreed
to
participate
in
a
continuation
of
the
investigation...
the
so-called
"controlled"
delivery
in
chicago.
he
was
flown
to
chicago
to
participate
in
the
controlled
delivery.
the
idea,
of
course,
being
to
try
to
capture
the
people
who
were
buying
the
cocaine
from
him.
and
the
agents...
one
of
the
agents
drove
the
truck.
the
controlled
delivery
failed.
the
buyers
did
not
show
up
and
mr.
montalvo
was
immediately
taken
into
district
court.
a
complaint
and
warrant
were
filed,
and
he
was
ordered
to...
transferred
back
to
new
mexico.
in
new
mexico
a
detention
hearing
was
set
and
held.
the
day
of
that
detention
hearing
was
february
16th.
he
had
been
initially
arrested
on
february
8th,
and
the
transfer
hearing
had
occurred
on
february
10th.
at
the
detention
hearing,
the
magistrate,
noting
that
no
pre-trial
services
report
had
been
made
and
that
mr.
montalvo's
counsel
had
just
been
hired
about
three
hours
before
the
hearing,
granted
a
continuance,
which...
the
magistrate
was
apparently
under
a
misapprehension
had
been
requested
by
the
government,
but
in
fact
there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
reflects
it
was
requested
by
the
government,
until
february
21st,
which
was
two
working
days
later.
this
was
over
the
president's
day
holiday
weekend.
at
that
hearing
the
magistrate
then
took
evidence
and
decided
that
mr.
montalvo
was
releasable.
the
government
immediately
took
an
appeal,
and
two
days
later
the
district
court
took
evidence
in
a
much
longer
hearing
and
decided
that
mr.
montalvo
was
in
fact
not
releasable
under
the
pretrial
detention
standards
of
the
act
because
he
was
both
a
risk
of
flight
and
also
he
presented
a
case
of
dangerousness
to
the
community
that
could
not
be
disposed
of
by
any
conditions
placed
on
his
liberty.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
we
do.
we
have
brought
the
case
to
this
court
without
contesting
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
violation.
as
we've
indicated--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
was
contested
in
the
district
court.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
there
are
a
number
of
grounds
on
which
it
could
be
contested,
and
in
fact
we
did
contest
it
both
in
the
district
court
and
in
the
court
of
appeals,
but
we
lost.
and
we
think
the
more
important
question
is,
assuming
a
violation,
what
follows
from
that?
now,
the
district
court,
having
found
that
mr.
montalvo
was
detainable
both
on
risk
of
flight
and
on
dangerousness,
nonetheless
said
that
there
was
no
legal
way
that
the
court
could
detain
him
because
the
court
found
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
time
limits
of
the
act,
principally
because
the
waiver
in
chicago
of
his
right
to
a
detention
hearing
had
not
been
adequate
under
johnson
against
zerbst.
and
that
the
magistrate,
on
february
16th,
had
failed
to...
what
the
magistrate
had
done
that
was
wrong
is
that
he
had
a
granted
a
sua
sponte
continuance
rather
than
having
a
motion
made
by
one
of
the
parties
for
a
continuance.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
your
honor...
your
honor.
just
very
briefly,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
what
amount,
for
our
purposes,
to
essentially
the
same
grounds
as
the
district
court,
saying
that
simply
the
fact
that
there
was
a
time
violation
meant
that
he
had
to
be
released
on
conditions.
now,
our
position
is
that
the...
once
there
has
been
a
violation,
that
the
language
and
purposes
of
the
pretrial
detention
statute
do
not
require
automatic
release.
in
fact
we
look
to
both
the
language
of
the
statute
and
the
purposes
underlying
the
statute.
and
we
suggest
that
what
the
statute
is
really
about
is
it
provides
a
limited
period
within
which
somebody
can
be
held
prior
to
a
detention
hearing.
it
does
not
provide
or
suggest
and
shouldn't
be
held
to
provide
that
a
detention
hearing
must
be
held
within
a
specific
period
of
time,
and
if
it
is
not
held
within
that
period
of
time
that
the
defendant
may
not,
for
any
purpose
thereafter,
be
detained.
the
language
of
the
statute
does
not
specify,
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
what
the
consequences
of
a
violation
are.
the
language
is
simply
that
a
hearing
shall
be
held
immediately
upon
the
person's
first
appearance
before
the
judicial
officer,
absent
a
continuance
for
a
period
of
three
days
or
five
days
or
longer
if
there's
good
cause
found.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
the
relief
is...
is
a
form
of
relief
that
the
defendant
can
see
prospectively,
if
he
is
in
fact
held
for
longer
than
the
period
that
the
statute
permits.
let
me
give
an
example.
suppose
mr.
montalvo
had
decided
on
february
13th,
before
the
detention
hearing,
that
in
fact
he
had
already
been
held
for
as
long
as
he
could
lawfully
be
held.
he
could
have
moved
in
the
district
court
for
release
at
that
point
or,
in
the
alternative,
a
prompt
hearing
immediately.
and
because
the
statute
provides
a
period
of
lawful,
pretrial
relief...
pretrial
detention
prior
to
the
holding
of
a
hearing,
which
is
confined
to
a
period
of
three
days
or
two
days...
excuse
me...
three
days
or
five
days,
depending
on
who
moves
for
the
continuance,
he
might
very
well
have
been
able
to
persuade
the
magistrate
at
that
point
that
the
government
no
longer
had
a
right
to
detain
him,
absent
a
hearing.
so
he
would
have
been
able
to
obtain
either
a
hearing
right
then
or
release
right
then.
but
once
he's
past
that,
once
he
has
failed
to
raise
that
point,
and
we
are
on
into
the
detention
period
and
we're...
well,
a
hearing
has
occurred,
and
he
has
been
found
to
be
detainable,
then
you
can't
go
back
and
say,
well,
he
shouldn't
have
been
held
for
that
period
of
time
between
the
expiration
of
the
period
that
the
statute
permits
and
the
time
that
the
detention
hearing
was
actually
held.
and
because
he
shouldn't
have
been
held
for
that
two
or
three-day
period,
he
can't
be
detained
forever
at...
ever.
that
the
statute
simply
doesn't
suggest
that
that
kind
of
remedy
is
appropriate,
looking
retrospectively
for
that
kind
of
violation.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
the
court
does
have
inherent
authority,
but
the
act
provides
a
limitation
on
the
period
for
normal
court
cases.
there
may
be
extraordinary
cases
in
which
a
court
can
hold
without
proceeding
under
the
act.
but
normally,
what
the
act
provides
is
this
is
a
period
of
lawful
detention.
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
anything
beyond
this
is
necessarily
unlawful
because
they
may
be
circumstances
in
which
the
inherent
authority
of
the
court
comes
into
play.
in
fact
there's
a
case--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
it
would
be
under
the
authority
of
an
arrest
warrant,
so
it
would
be
the...
it
would
be
the
marshal
who
would
hold
the
person
but
the
authority
would
be
granted
by
the
arrest
warrant
under
which
the
person
was
arrested.
and
there
would
have
to
be,
for
example,
a
preliminary
examination
within
a
period
of
ten
days
if
the
individual
was
in
custody.
and
at
the
expiration
of
that
period,
a
hearing
would
have
to
be
held
to
determine
probable
cause.
but...
what
i
think
the
statute
does,
to
answer
your
question,
is
the
statute
provides
for
an
area
of
lawfulness
to
hold,
pending
a
hearing,
but
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that,
in
extraordinary
circumstances,
holding
a
person
for
some
other
purpose,
may
be
unlawful.
this
just
gives
us
a
safe
ground
for
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
the
inherent
power
really
has
to
be
limited
to
extraordinary
cases.
the
statute
provides
for
the
ordinary
case
in
which
a
motion
is
made.
the
extraordinary
cases,
let
me
point
out,
really,
in
the
cases
that
come
before
the
statute
that
are
discussed
in
the
senate
report
on
this...
on
this
act,
make
the
point
that
these
are
really
are
exceptional
cases.
they
are
cases,
for
example,
in
which
an
individual
has
made
very
clear
threats
against
witnesses,
where
the
court
simply
has
no
other
option
but
to
hold
the
individual
under
the
inherent
authority
of
the
court.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
in
the
ordinary
run-of-the-mine
case,
the
court
can
simply
hold
somebody
in
disregard
of
the
limitations
in
the
statute.
ordinarily,
the
statute
would
provide
the
outer
limit
on
the
period
that
you
could
be
held
without
a
detention
hearing.
but
again,
that
does
not
mean
that
the
remedy
for
holding
longer
than
that
period
is
that
you
automatically
say
no
detention
hearing
can
be
held
and
no
detention
can
be
ordered.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
he
was
sent
to
chicago
on
the
8th.
he
had
his
initial
appearance
in
court
in
chicago
on
the
10th.
so
that
if
you
regard
that
as
being
the
initial...
the
initial
appearance--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--and
you
say
that
his
waiver
was
invalid
at
that
point--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--he
could
have
made
a
motion
in
chicago
for...
he
certainly
could
have
requested
an
immediate
hearing.
the
government
was
prepared
to
give
him
a
hearing
right
then
and
there.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
his
counsel
waived
it.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
there
wasn't
very
much
time
following
his--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--his
appearance.
only
a
few
hours.
he
appeared
in
court
on
the
afternoon
of
friday,
february
10th.
and
he
was
back
in
new
mexico
at
about
11
o'clock
that
night.
so
he
was
back
the
same
day
that
he
had
his
hearing.
now,
a
weekend
intervened,
so
it
wasn't
until
monday
morning
that
the
government
called
the
magistrate's
office
and
asked
for
a
hearing.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
there
were
only
two
days;
he
was
arrested
on
the
8th,
and
he
was
up
in
chicago
by
the
10th
and
back
on
the
10th.
so
there
was
really
only
a
two-day
period.
he
could
have
asked
at
the
time;
he
could
have
insisted
on
an
initial
appearance
in
new
mexico,
i
think.
he
agreed
instead
to
cooperate,
but
there's
no
reason
that
he
couldn't
have
said,
i'm
not
cooperating
with
you
fellows.
i
want
to
stay
right
here
and
have
an
initial
appearance
here.
but
he
didn't.
he
agreed
to
cooperate;
he
went
to
chicago.
in
chicago
he...
his
counsel,
and
the
question
of
the
validity
of
the
waiver,
of
course,
is...
was
not
resolved
by
the
court
of
appeals.
but
his
counsel
sought
to
waive
a
detention
hearing
at
that
time,
and
that's
why
it
was
agreed
that
he
could
go
back
to
new
mexico.
where,
on
the
13th,
he
was...
the
government
made
a
request
that
a
detention
hearing
be
set,
and
the
detention
hearing
was
set
for
that...
the
next
available
date,
which
was
the
16th.
now,
at
that
point,
he
might
have
said,
stop,
i
want
a
detention
hearing
right
now.
and
if
the
magistrate
in
the
district
court
had
concluded
that
the
time
had
already
run
or
was
running--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
no.
he
retained
counsel--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no
one
was
required
to
tell
him
that,
your
honor.
he
retained
counsel.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
there
are
lots
of
rights,
as
your
honor
well
knows,
that
one
can
exercise
more
effectively
with
counsel
than
without.
he
did
hire
counsel.
he
was
eligible
to
hire
counsel.
and
in
fact,
counsel
was
appointed
for
him
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
wasn't
eligible
for
appointment.
the
district
court
magistrate
appointed
counsel
in
advance
of
the
hearing.
he
then
retained
counsel.
but
that
didn't
occur
until
the
16th.
he,
for
whatever
reason,
did
not
obtain
counsel
until
then.
at
that
point,
counsel
sought
to
protect
his
rights.
but
significantly,
we
believe,
did
not
seek
to
do
so
by
opposing
the
continuance
that
the
magistrate
granted.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
william
c.
bryson
he
did.
at
the
hearing
he
had
both
retained
counsel
and
the
counsel
who
had
been
appointed
the
previous
day
for
him.
retained
counsel
had
only
been
retained
that
day,
the
day
of
the
hearing.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
he
had
appointed
counsel
in
chicago,
your
honor...
a
public
defender.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
hearing
in
new
mexico--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--let
me
back
up
and
give
the
chronology
because
it
gets
a
little
bit
complicated.
on
the
13th,
which
is
a
monday,
the
government
asked
for
a
hearing
to
be
set.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no.
that
was
a
telephone
call
from
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--exactly.
and
then
on
the
16th,
that
hearing
was
held.
that
was
a
very
brief
hearing
in
which
the
magistrate,
discovering
that
there
had
been
no
pretrial
services
report
prepared,
and
that
counsel
had
only
been
retained
that
day--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--kicked
it
over
to
the
21st.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
they
would
either
have
to
give
him
a
hearing
or,
i
submit,
the
magistrate
could
have
granted
a
continuance
if
the
government,
at
that
point,
had
moved
for
it
because--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
he
would
not
because
in...
at
that...
at
that
point
because...
well--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well...
no,
no.
he
wouldn't
have
the
right
to
release.
it
depends
on
whether
you
regard
the
initial
appearance
in
chicago
as
having
been
the
first
appearance
that
triggers
the
statute.
if
you
do,
and
if
you
further
regard
there
as
having
been
either
no
continuance
granted
at
that
time
or
a
continuance
on
the
motion
of
the
government
for
five
days,
then
yes,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
on
the
16th
he
would
have
been
entitled
to
a
hearing
right
now.
now,
what
the
magistrate
could
have
done,
of
course,
at
that
point
under
the
statute,
would
be
to
have
begun
the
hearing
at
that
point
and
simply
said,
we
will
hear,
we
will
begin
the
hearing
and
we
will
resume
when
we
get--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
there
are...
some
of
these
hearings
go
on
for
quite
a
while.
and
the
statute
provides--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
it's
bad
practice,
but
the
statute
would
not
prohibit
it.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
also,
your
honor,
there's
lots
of
room,
you
know,
flexibility
that
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
there
are
a
lot
of
ways
which,
if
you
play
your
cards
right,
you
can
extend
the
period
of
detention.
i
think,
ordinarily,
people
don't
do
that,
because
people
are
trying
to
get
these
things
decided
very
quickly.
but
if
you
want
to
be
cute
about
it,
you
can
start...
you
can
stop
the
time
from
running
in
a
lot
of
ways,
including
simply
making
a
finding
of
good
cause
for
a
long
continuance.
if
you
start
the
hearing,
you
can
have
the
hearing
and
then
just
simply
take
a
long
time
to
decide
the
question
of
detention.
he
can
be
held
during
that
period.
i
think
that's
not...
that's
not
consistent
with
the
spirit
of
the
act.
but
to
the
technical
legal
answer
to
the
question
is
yes,
it
could
be
done
that
way.
but
we
don't
typically
do
it
that
way.
there
may
be
instances
in
which
those
kinds
of
instances,
things
have
happened,
but
not
simply
in
order
to
hold
the
person.
the...
as
i
say,
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
not
to
serve
the
kinds
of
interests
that
a
statute
of
limitations
serves
or
rule
4
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
or
for
that
matter,
28
u.s.c.
2101
that
governs
the
time
for
petitioning
for
certiorari
in
this
case,
all
of
which
are
statutes
and
rules
that
embody
principles
of
repose.
in
this
case,
what...
the
interest
that's
really
being
protected
by
the
time
limits,
as
i
say,
is
the
interest
in
avoiding
the
temporary
detention
without
due
process.
now,
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it's
conceivable
that
he
could
have...
assuming
that
he
was
confined
by
the
government
acting
in
clear
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights,
it's
conceivable
that
he
might
have
a
civil
action.
and
i
think
he...
to
be
frank
about
it
now,
the...
he
would
have
some
problems
with
immunity
and
so
forth.
but
it's
conceivable
there
could
be
a
bivins
action,
assuming
that
there
is
a
constitutional
violation
in
this
interim
period
of
holding.
but--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes.
this
has
the
ironic
effect,
of
course,
of
saying
that
anyone
who
is
not
detained
and,
indeed,
anybody
who's
not
detained
and
is
subsequently
vindicated
in
court,
is
the
person
without
a
remedy.
but
of
course,
the
remedy
that
is
proposed
here
by
mr.
montalvo
doesn't
help
that
person
either.
mr.
montalvo's
remedy
only
helps
people
like
mr.
montalvo,
who
in
fact
are
found
to
be
subject
to
detention.
so
his
remedy
isn't...
in
that
respect,
doesn't
help
the
non-detained
person.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
on
the
21st.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
he
can
be
and
he
was.
that's
right.
lawfully,
he
can
be
detained
during
the
appeal.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
this
case,
we
think,
to
follow
up
on
justice
rehnquist's
question
is,
in
a
sense,
like
the
mechanik
case
decided
by
this
court
relating
to
errors
before
the
grand
jury,
where
the...
any
error
in
the
process
leading
to
a
finding
of
probable
cause,
is
deemed
to
be
harmless
when
it's
followed
by
a
judgment
of
conviction.
here,
by
the
same
token,
the
error
in
temporary
detention
is
rendered,
in
a
sense,
harmless
by
the
fact
that
he
is
later
found
to
be
detainable.
even
if
a
remedy
would
be
appropriate
in
some
instances,
though,
for
cases
in
which
somebody
is
held
during
this
temporary
period
and
is
later
held
to
be
detained...
even
if
there
would
be
a
remedy
that
would
be...
if
the
remedy
of
barring
the
government
from
ever
obtaining
detention
would
be
appropriate
in
some
instances,
it's
not
here.
first
of
all,
there
was
no
assertion
by
the
defendant
of
his
rights
at
any
point
in
this
process.
he
didn't
object
to
the
continuances.
he...
and
indeed
he
sought
to
waive
objection
in
chicago
to
the
postponement
of
the
hearing
there.
and
second,
this
is
a
case
in
which,
as
the
district
court
found,
and
the
district
court
made
very
thorough
findings
on
these
points,
was
a
very
strong
case,
both
for
detention
and
a
very
strong
case
on
the
merits
of
the
case
against
him.
there...
mr.
montalvo
had
extremely
strong
ties
to
mexico;
he
had
lived
there
for
two
of
the
previous
three
years,
as
the
district
court
found,
and
had
a
business...
had
two
businesses
down
there
which
he
had
only
recently
sold.
he
had
a
house
down
there
which
he
had
recently
sold.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it
didn't,
but
the
hearing
before
the
magistrate
was
extremely
brief.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
with
all
respect
to
the
magistrate,
i
think
the
magistrate
was
way
off
base
in
this
case.
and
the
district
court
essentially
reached
the
same
conclusion.
the
magistrate...
the
presentation
before
the
magistrate
was
extremely
brief,
and
the
presentation
before
the
district
court
was
much
longer.
and
before
the
district
court,
the
district
court
concluded
that,
based
on
a
lot
of
evidence,
that
this
was
an
extremely
strong
case
for
detention.
and
in
fact
there
is...
the
argument
in
favor
of
becoming
a
fugitive,
in
this
case,
must
have
seemed
to
mr.
montalvo,
an
extremely
strong
one.
he
was
facing
ten
years,
minimum,
in
prison
upon
a
case
in
which
there
was
virtually
no
chance
of
acquittal.
the
suppression
motion
would
have
been
hopeless
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
the
government
would
have
been
in
the
position
to
make
a
motion
to
reduce
below
the
ten-year
minimum
for
cooperation,
and
might
well
have
done.
but
that
never
happened.
in
any
event,
this
was
a
case
in
which
if
there
ever
is
a
case
in
which
the
remedy
of
precluding
detention
is
appropriate,
this
is
not
that
case.
now,
i
would
point
out
that
the
argument
that's
being
made
on
the
other
side,
as
i
understand
it,
is
essentially
that
the
hearing
time
limits
established,
in
essence,
a
condition
precedent
for
detention.
but
that
argument
is
an
extremely
sweeping
one.
if
you
say
that
any
statute
that
says
that
something
shall
be
done
according
to
the
following
provisions,
and
that's
what
this
statute
says,
means
that
it
may
not,
in
any
event...
that
the
hearing
is
in
this
case...
may
not
be
held
unless
those
procedures
are
followed,
would
suggest
that
all
of
the
procedures
that
are
found
in
section
f
are
conditions
precedent
to
detention.
and
yet
there
are
a
lot
of
procedures
in
which
there
may
be
a
minor
error
here
or
there
among
the
procedures
in
subsection
f,
just
as
there
are
many
provisions
in
title
18,
as
to
which
there
may
be
a
minor
error
here
and
there
without
undercutting
a
defendant's
conviction.
under
subsection
f,
there
may
be
a
variety
of
errors
that
could
be
made,
none
of
which
end
up
being
prejudicial.
and
you
would
not
say
that
the
hearing
simply
cannot
be
held
or
that
the
detention
cannot
be
ordered
because
of
those
kinds
of
orders,
assuming
that
you
conclude
that
they
really
didn't
prejudice
the
defendant.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
only
a
couple
of
points,
your
honor.
first,
i
think
the
closest
analogy
to
the
case
of
a
statute
or
rule
that
has
mandatory
language
that
does
not
typically
result
in
any
sanctions
or
any
remedy
that
results
in
disabling
the
government
from
proceeding,
is
the
initial
appearance
rule
which
is
closely
related
to
the
pretrial
detention
rule,
and
that's
rule
5
which
says
that
someone
shall
be
taken
to
a
magistrate
upon
arrest
without
unnecessary
delay.
assume
that
there
isn't
a
statement
which
is
taken
from
the
individual
and
subject
to
suppression
during
the
period
of
unnecessary
delay...
the
mere
fact
of
delay
has
never
been
held
or
thought
to
result
in
the
dismissal
of
the
proceedings
against
the
defendant.
it...
and
yet
i
think
it's
interesting
to
note
that
in
fact,
despite
the
absence
of
any
remedy,
compliance
with
this
statute,
with
this...
excuse
me,
with
this
rule,
is
quite
good.
i
mean,
the
agents
are
trained
and
they
do
follow
their
training
to
bring
people
before
magistrates
without
unnecessary
delay.
there
are
exceptional
cases
and,
indeed,
this
one
may
be
one
in
which,
shortly
after
arrest,
there's
an
agreement
to
cooperate,
but...
in
which
the
appearance
does
not
occur
immediately.
but
typically
it
occurs
within
a
matter
of
hours.
the
second
point
is
that...
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind,
i
think,
when
you
look
at
the
argument
made
by
respondent
with
respect
to
the
contention
that
the...
it's
no
real
harm
to
the
government
to
be
put
back
in
the
position
of
simply
having
to
ask
for
conditions
on
release.
because,
after
all,
that
was
the
system
before
1984.
but
there's
been
a
very
big
and
important
change
in
this
statute
from
the
pre-1984
system.
what
congress
did
in
'84
was
to
make
essentially
a
bargain
in
favor
of
candor
and
fairness.
and
the
bargain
was
this:
there
would
be
a
pretrial
detention
provision
in
which
pretrial
detention
could
be
ordered
directly,
candidly;
where
this
is
what
we're
doing.
but
there
was
a
provision
that
said,
you
cannot
hold
somebody
on
unrealistically
high
bail.
if
you're
going
to
set
bail,
it's
got
to
be
bail
that
that
person
can
meet.
that's
the
reason
that
bail
in
this
case,
when
it
way
set,
was
set
at
$88,000
instead
of
half
a
million.
if
it
had
been
under
the
old
system,
it
would
have
been
simple.
they
wouldn't
have
had
a
hearing
at
all,
or
not
much
of
one.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
that's
3142(c)(2),
your
honor.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it's
a
huge
change.
and
what
it
means
is,
people
like
mr.
montalvo,
who
somehow
manage
to
avoid
the
detention
statute,
even
though
they
should
be
detained,
are
given
a
free
pass.
under
the
old
statute,
bail
would
have
been
set
at
a
very
high
level,
and
he
would
never
have
gotten
out.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
it's
not
free,
but
if
he
is
in
fact
carrying
a
million
dollars
of
cocaine...
but
he's
carrying
a
million
dollars
of
cocaine,
i
submit
that
he
probably
has
access
to
$88,000.
and
if
he's
facing
ten
years
in
jail,
he
may
well
think
the
bargain
is
well
worth
it.
he
certainly
did
in
this
case,
for
all
that
appears.
thank
you.
