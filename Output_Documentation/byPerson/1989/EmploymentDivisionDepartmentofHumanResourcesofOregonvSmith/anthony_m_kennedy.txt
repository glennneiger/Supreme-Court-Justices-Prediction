justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
documentation
in
the
record
or
in
reported
opinions
of
the
danger
that
peyote
is
diverted
from
religious
use
and,
say,
sold
on
the
street
in
the
normal
drug
distribution
channels?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
used
for
the
derivative
mescaline,
which
in
turn
is
used
commercially?
or
can
you
get
mescaline
from
some
other
source?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
this
record
show
the
presence
of
peyote
buttons
in
the
normal
drug
trade
in
any
significant
amounts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
from
whom?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
wisconsin
legislature
had
singled
out
the
amish
church.
just
because
this
court
singles
that
out
it
is
all
right,
but
the
legislature
can't?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
it
a
plausible
reading
of
the
oregon
supreme
court's
opinion
on
remand
that
even
if
we
reached
the
criminals
question
and
sustained
the
criminal
statute,
that
the
unemployment
benefit
is
going
to
be
paid
anyway?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
do
concede,
i
take
it,
that
the
enforcement
of
the
oregon
criminal
laws
would
in
effect
destroy
the
native
american
church
and
its
ritual
in
your
state.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
attorney
general
mentioned
the
incidence
of
18
to
30
buttons
being
consumed.
would
that
be
a
dangerous
use,
or
a
use
that
the
state
could
proscribe?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
am
not
sure
if
it
is
a
general
problem
with
the
record
or
a
general
problem
with
the
exemption
you
seek
to
have
us
adopt.
