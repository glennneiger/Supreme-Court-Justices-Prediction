rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-1213,
employment
division
of
oregon
v.
alfred
smith.
mr.
frohnmayer,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that
one
need
not
be
a
native
american
to
be
admitted
to
the
native
american
church,
or
to
participate
in
its
rituals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
frohnmayer.
mr.
dorsay,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
gives
the
appearance
of
being
[inaudible]
script
in
a
way,
when
it
says,
when
it
is
describing
its
previous
opinion.
it
says,
we
also
stated--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--as
it
if
was
just
repeating
what
it
said
in
its
earlier
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
get
to
a
point
where
some
of
this
is
water
over
the
dam,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
we
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
presented,
which
is
whether
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment
protects
a
person's
religiously-motivated
use
of
peyote
from
the
reach
of
the
state's
general
criminal
law
prohibition.
and
you
say
maybe
it
is
not
so
much
a
question
of
criminal
law,
but
you
agree
that
the
first
amendment
issue
is
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
dorsay,
do
you
say
that
the
state
of
oregon
can't
rely
at
all
on
the
fact
that
the
peyote
is
shown
as
a
schedule
i
drug?
that
the
facts
behind
that
have
to
be
proved
all
over
again?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
oregon
legislatures
didn't
choose
to
grant
the
exemption.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
oregon
didn't
provide
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
dorsay.
general
frohnmayer,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
frohnmayer.
the
case
is
submitted.
