these
problems.
justice
byron
r.

you
just
don't
want
to
have
to
face
up
to
those
problems.
you
want
to
be
able
to...
not
to
have
any
exemption
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
to
enforce
the
law
to
the
extent
that
some
drug
counselor
who
violates
his
employer's
rules
isn't
protected...
doesn't
get
unemployment
compensation.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you...
why
do
you
say
that
the...
these
people
are
entitled
to
workmen's
compensation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
so
the
first
amendment
issue
is
here,
i
take
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
says
that
the...
your
court
says
they
are
entitled
to
compensation
because
the
first
amendment
requires
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the...
even
though
the
employee
breached
the
rules
of
the
employer.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
it
is
that
there
was
a
rule
like
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
despite
the
first
amendment.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
reason
the
benefits
are
required
in
this
case,
according
to
the
court
below,
is
that
it...
the
first
amendment
requires
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
may,
it
may
have
said
that,
whether
it
is
criminal
under
oregon
law
is
irrelevant--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but,
but
we
don't
need
to
think
that
it
is
irrelevant
to
the
first
amendment
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
why
we...
i
suppose
that
is
why
we
remanded.
justice
byron
r.
white
general,
suppose
you
just
frankly
said,
or
just
from
experience
you
would
conclude
that
the
state's
criminal
law,
even
if
they
could
apply
it,
is
just
never
applied
to
these
ceremonies.
they
are
just
never
going
to
do
it.
i
guess
the
case
is
still
alive
because
of
this...
this
workmen's
compensation
issue.
