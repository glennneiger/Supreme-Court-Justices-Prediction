but
the
federal
exemption
and
the
exemption
in
the
12
states
you
are
talking
about
applies
only
to
use
by
a
member
of
the
native
american
church?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
if
you
are
sort
of
the
martin
luther
king,
the
martin
luther...
not
king,
of
the
native
american
church,
you
are
just
out
of
luck.
you
can't
start
a
branch
religion
using
peyote.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
states
that
limit
the
exemption
to
the
native
american
church.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
is
also
another
problem
in
deciding
what
the
states
can
do
without
offending
the
establishment
clause.
there
is
a
problem
in
just
allowing
all
religions
to
use
peyote,
but
not
allowing
all
religions
to
use
marijuana,
or
any
other
hallucinogenic
drug,
i
would
assume.
isn't
that
a
problem,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
say
that
it
would
be
at
least
a
close
case
as
to
whether
a
state
could
prohibit
this
and
not
prohibit
the
use
of
alcohol
in
worship
services
to
the
point
of
inebriation.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
frohnmayer,
you...
much
earlier
on
you
said
that
the
state
was
presented
with
the
problem
of
whether
to
make
a
de
minimis
exemption.
what
did
you
mean
by
a
de
minimis
exemption?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
conceded
that...
that
the
use
of
peyote
in
these
ceremonies
is
only
de
minimis?
are
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
inappropriate
police
intrusion?
you
are
asserting
that
they
have
the
right
to
intrude.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
haven't
been
destroyed,
it
is
just
that
you
have
had
inefficient
enforcement.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
event,
that
is
the
reason.
are
you
saying
you
are
not
going
to
enforce
the
criminal
law
if
we
sustain
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
could...
couldn't
it
be
that
the
exception
that
the
oregon
court
was
referring
to
might
have
been
an
exception
for
the
use
of
peyote
in
insignificant
quantities
that
could...
could
not
produce
any
hallucinogenic
or
other
adverse
physical
effect?
might
not
that
be
the
exception
that
they
were
referring
to?
and
if
that's
the
case,
then...
then
your
pointing
to
the
traditional
use
of
wine
at
religion
services
would
not
make
any
difference.
i
don't
assume
that
the
states
would
be
compelled
to
allow
excessive
use
of
alcohol,
drunken...
drunken
parties,
under...
on
grounds
of
religion.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yeah,
but,
you
see,
i
don't
see
a
correlation
between
the
wine
and
the
peyote.
i
mean,
it
is
acknowledge
that
the
peyote...
do
you
disagree
with
what
the
attorney
general
said,
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
ingestion
of
the
peyote
is
its
hallucinogenic
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
did
it
get
to
be
a
schedule
i
controlled
substance?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
somebody
thinks
it
is
harmful.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
would
such
evidence
be
acquired?
would
you
want
the
state
to
send
agents
into
church
services
to
observe
them
carefully
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dorsay,
i...
whether
it
is
irrelevant
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
i
mean,
it
might
be
irrelevant
to
whether
you
can
fire
the
person--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
violation
of
your
state
rules,
as
an
original
matter.
but
it
may
not
be
irrelevant
to
the
defense.
i
mean,
is
the
supreme
court
of
oregon
saying
that
it
makes
no
difference
under
oregon
law
whether
you
have
a
defense
to
the
firing,
that
the
matter
is
criminal,
that
a
religious
practice
is
criminal
under
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
tell
me,
what
does
that
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
a
very
good
case
could
be
made
on
the
basis
of
what
you
say,
that
there
is
no
risk
of
its
use
spreading
beyond
the
native
american
church.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
that
church
has
been
responsible
in
its
use.
but
why
can't
the
state
say
we
don't
want
native
american
church
members
to
use
it
either.
we
think
this
is
dangerous.
it
is
harmful
to
people.
we
don't
want
children
to
be
brought
into
this
church
and
taught
to
use
this
thing,
it
is
harmful
to
them.
it
is
a
schedule
i
substance;
we
have
made
that
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
what
do
you
mean
in
fact
occurred?
you
would
not
accept
scientific
evidence
that
the
use
of
peyote
is
physically
harmful?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
general.
you
would
require
the
showing
in
the
particular
context
of
the
religious
service?
justice
antonin
scalia
only
because
the
law
is
not
enforced.
i
mean,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it
occurs
on
the
reservation
and
the
law
enforcement
authorities
say
it
can
occur...
i
am,
i
am
not
comforted
by
the
fact
that
it
doesn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--cause
a
law
enforcement
problem.
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
can't
the
state
consider
it
itself
as
the
law
enforcement
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
very
use,
even
in
religious
services.
just
as
the
state
may
consider
the
very
use
of
marijuana,
regardless
of
whether
it
pollutes
commerce
or
anything
else,
as
being
itself
a
problem.
we
don't
want
it
used.
why
can't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
long
as
it
does
it
generally,
i
think...
why
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
it
does
it
generally
and
doesn't
pick
on
a
particular
religion.
it
has
a
generally
applicable
law
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
suppose
you
could
say
a
law
against
human
sacrifice
would,
you
know,
would
affect
only
the
aztecs.
but
i
don't
know
that
you
have
to
make...
you
have
to
make
exceptions.
if
it
is
a
generally
applicable
law
that
the
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
--[inaudible]
snakes.
nobody
shall
handle
poisonous
snakes.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
burden
is
on
the
state
to
show
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
there
were
a
cult
that
used
rattlesnakes,
the
state
would
have
to
show
that
in
the
use
of
those
rattlesnakes
somebody
has
been
killed
or
hurt.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
about
the
harm
that
peyote
can
cause.
you
haven't
disputed
that,
the
general
dangerousness
of
it,
have
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
record
here
showed
that
some
members
of
the
church
do
use
it
to
cure
illness,
apart
from
these
mass
ceremonies
where
they
use
it,
but
some
use
it
at
home--
justice
antonin
scalia
the
second
case,
no.
88-1213,
is
employment
division
department
of
human
resources
of
oregon
versus
smith.
that
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
oregon.
its
procedural
background
is
complex
suffices
to
say
that
the
issue
currently
before
us
is
whether
oregon’s
criminal
law
against
the
use
of
certain
mind-altering
drugs
including
peyote,
can
constitutionally
be
applied
to
the
respondent’s
sacramental
use
of
peyote
in
ceremonies
of
the
native
american
church.
the
oregon
supreme
court
held
that
because
of
the
free
exercise
clause
of
the
first
amendment,
it
could
not.
we
reverse
that
judgment.
the
first
amendment
prevents
the
government
from
“prohibiting
the
free
exercise
of
religion.”
our
case
established
that
this
prevents
the
government
from
penalizing
adherence
to
a
religious
position
or
the
profession
of
a
religious
belief.
it
also
prevents
the
government
from
penalizing
an
action
only
because
that
action
is
taken
for
religious
reasons
or
only
because
of
the
religious
beliefs
that
action
displays.
but
respondent
seek
to
carry
the
meaning
of
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
of
religion
one
large
step
further.
they
contend
that
a
religious
motivation
for
engaging
in
legally
prohibited
action
or
for
failing
to
take
legally
required
action
places
the
citizen
beyond
the
reach
of
a
law
that
is
not
specifically
directed
at
his
religious
practice
and
that
is
conceivably
constitutional
as
applied
to
others.
we
reject
that
interpretation.
it
no
more
prohibits
the
free
exercise
of
religion
to
compel,
for
example,
the
payment
of
a
general
tax
by
those
who
believe
support
of
organized
government
to
be
sinful
then
it
abridges
freedom
of
the
press
to
compel
payment
of
the
tax
as
a
condition
to
a
newspaper
staying
in
business.
the
respondent’s
contention
that
our
precedent
requires
a
religious
practice
exemption
to
generally
applicable
laws
is
mistaken.
a
long
line
of
our
decisions
has
held
that
an
individual’s
religious
beliefs
do
not
exclude
him
from
compliance
with
an
otherwise
valid
law
prohibiting
conduct
that
the
state
is
free
to
regulate,
for
example,
laws
prohibiting
polygamy,
laws
regulating
the
use
of
child
labor,
laws
requiring
individuals
to
perform
military
service,
and
laws
compelling
individuals
to
pay
taxes.
the
only
decisions
in
which
we
have
held
that
the
first
amendment
bars
application
of
a
neutral
generally
applicable
law
to
religiously
motivated
action
have
involved
not
the
free
exercise
clause
alone,
but
the
free
exercise
clause
in
conjunction
with
other
constitutional
protections
such
as
freedom
of
speech
or
the
right
of
parents
to
direct
the
education
of
their
children.
we
reject
respondent’s
argument
that
governmental
actions
burdening
religion
must
be
justified
by
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
the
government’s
ability
to
enforce
its
criminal
laws
like
its
ability
to
carryout
other
aspects
of
public
policy
cannot
depend
on
measuring
the
effects
of
a
governmental
action
on
a
religious
objective
spiritual
development.
to
make
an
individual’s
obligation
to
obey
such
a
law,
contingent
upon
the
law’s
coincidence
with
his
religious
beliefs
except
where
the
state’s
interest
is
compelling
permitting
him
by
virtue
of
his
beliefs
to
become
a
law
unto
himself,
it
contradicts
both
constitutional
tradition
and
common
sense.
precisely
because
we
value
and
nurture
religious
diversity
in
this
country,
we
cannot
afford
the
luxury
of
deeming
presumptively
invalid
as
applied
to
the
religious
objector,
every
regulation
of
conduct
that
does
not
protect
in
interest
of
the
highest
order.
the
rule
respondent’s
favor
would
open
the
prospect
of
constitutionally
required
exemptions
and
civic
obligations
of
every
conceivable
kind,
nor
is
it
possible
for
us
to
limit
the
impact
of
respondent’s
proposal
to
situations
in
which
the
religiously
inspired
conduct
is
central
to
the
individual’s
religion.
repeatedly
and
in
many
different
contexts,
we
have
warned
that
courts
must
not
presume
to
determine
the
place
of
a
particular
belief
in
a
religion
or
the
plausibility
of
a
religious
claim.
this
is
not
to
say
that
oregon
may
not,
if
it
wishes,
exempt
the
religious
use
of
peyote
from
its
criminal
prohibition.
it
assuredly
may.
a
number
of
other
states
have
done
so,
but
to
say
that
it
may
is
not
to
say
that
it
must.
we
reaffirm
today
what
justice
frankfurter
wrote
for
the
court
in
1940
“conscientious
scruples
have
not
in
the
course
of
the
long
struggle
for
religious
toleration
relieved
the
individual
from
obedience
to
a
general
law
not
aimed
at
the
promotion
or
restriction
of
religious
beliefs.
the
mere
possession
of
religious
convictions
which
contradict
the
relevant
concerns
of
political
society
does
not
relieve
the
citizen
from
the
discharge
of
political
responsibilities."
justice
o’connor
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justices
brennan,
marshall,
and
blackmun

in
