was
there
any
claim
in
that
case
that
the
oregon
constitution
barred
the
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
[inaudible]
unknown
speaker
by
whom?
unknown
speaker
any
religious
belief?
unknown
speaker
how
about
the
federal?
unknown
speaker
what
about
mr.
black--
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
but
a
quite
different
case.
unknown
speaker
--conceding
that
point?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
know
how
much
peyote
is
used
in
these
ceremonies,
i
gather
we
don't
know
that
it
is
just
a,
you
know,
a
sniff
or
whatever?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
would
be
denied
it
because
of
why?
because
of--
unknown
speaker
--because
it
was
a
breech
of
the
criminal
law?
unknown
speaker
you
can't
say
that
because
they...
the
court
has
said
the
illegality
is
beside
the
point.
unknown
speaker
it,
this
would
be,
it
would
be
misconduct,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i'll
bet
you
don't.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
how
often
are
these
ceremonies
held?
unknown
speaker
like
every
day?
unknown
speaker
is
peyote
habit
forming?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
any,
any
individual
outside
this
church
could
have
a
sincere
religious
belief
also
that
two
buttons
a
month
is
required
by
my
religious
beliefs,
and
that
can't
be
forbidden.
unknown
speaker
i
know,
what
if
he
says
i
have
a
ceremony
in
my
house
twice
a
month.
