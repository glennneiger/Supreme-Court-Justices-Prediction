mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
compelled
as
an
initial
matter
to
address
the
subject
raised
by
justice
stevens
relating
to
the
use
of
alcohol,
which
i
think
raised
one
of
the
primary
problems
with
this
case
as
it
comes
before
the
court.
i
think,
if
you
looked
at
this
situation
and
indian
people
were
in
charge
of
the
united
states
right
now,
or
in
charge
of
government,
and
you
look
at
the
devastating
impact
that
alcohol
has
had
on
indian
people
and
indian
tribes
through
the
history
of
the
united
states,
you
might
find
that
alcohol
was
the
schedule
i
substance
and
peyote
was
not
listed
at
all.
and
we
are
getting
here
to
the
heart
of
an
ethnocentric
view,
i
think,
of
what
constitutes
religion
in
the
united
states.
and
i
think
that
needs
to
be
looked
at
very
hard
before
determining
what
is
a
dangerous
substance
and
what
is
not.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
well,
that
is
correct.
and
that
interest
still
exists
here,
for
instance,
for
people
who
might
overuse
alcohol
in
a
religious
ceremony,
or
for
instance,
if
communion
is
administered
to
minors,
or
some
other
situation
in
which
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
no,
i
do
not
disagree
with
that.
what
i
disagree
with
is
the
fact
that
that
ingestion
is
harmful.
there
is
no
documented
evidence
that
the
use
of
the
peyote
in
these
carefully
circumscribed
ceremonials
has
any
harm
to
the
individual,
to
society
at
large,
or
to
the
state's
law
enforcement
efforts.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
well,
i
think
it
has--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--yes.
we
do
not
know
that
for
sure.
it
obviously,
the
drug
mescaline
has
a
high
potential
for
abuse.
that
is
what
schedule
i
says.
the
synthetic
derivative
has
obviously
been
misused
in
society
at
large.
there
is,
however,
no
evidence
that
peyote,
as
used
by
the
native
american
church,
has
been
misused
in
these
sense
that
is
has
been
misused
in
society.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
well,
we
have
a
long
history
with
this
church
of
hundreds
of
years,
and
there
has
been
no
documented
evidence.
we
have
one
or
two
anecdotal
instances.
i
think,
also,
if
you
are
going
to
look
at
the
legislative
judgment
that
peyote
is
a
dangerous
substance,
you
also
have
to
look
at
the
legislative
judgment
that
peyote
can
be
exempted.
there
is
some
kind
of
legislative
fact
finding
when
congress
and
other
states
have
acted
to
exempt
the
use
of
peyote.
they
have
based
this
in
large
part,
for
instance,
on
testimony
before
congress,
the
factual
findings
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
v.
woody,
that
there
have
been
no
evidence
that
there
have
been
harmful
use.
the
first
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
this
case
is
indistinguishable
from
the
previous
unemployment
cases
before
this
court.
the
oregon
supreme
court
has
now
decided
twice,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
that
the
criminality
of
respondent's
conduct
is
immaterial
to
oregon's
unemployment
compensation
law.
and
i
think
the
point,
i
believe
it
was
raised
by
justice
o'connor,
is
important
here,
and
that
is
the
reason
the
oregon
supreme
court
did
not
address
its
constitutional
question
under
state
law
is
because
the
criminality
was
not
relevant.
the
statement
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
on
remand
could
not
have
been
clearer.
it
said
we
also
stated
that
it
was
immaterial
to
oregon's
unemployment
compensation
law
whether
the
use
of
peyote
violated
some
other
law.
it
didn't
say
it
was
constrained
by
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court.
it
didn't
say
the
state
had
conceded
this
issue.
so
the
two
reasons
that
this
court
used
in
the
majority
opinion
last
time
to
find
that
the
decision
of
the
oregon
supreme
court
was
ambiguous,
and
that
was
why
this
decision
had
been
remanded,
has
now
been
cleared
up.
it
was
not
a
summary
of
its
previous
decisions.
the
oregon
court
did
not
address
a
large
number
of
things
it
said
in
its
first
decision.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
that
is
correct.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
well,
i
believe
what
they
did
is
they
responded
to
the
dissent's
invitation
to
say
this
is
what
we
said
the
first
time.
we
meant
it,
we
are
saying
it
again.
when
this
case
went
back
on
remand
to
the
oregon
supreme
court,
chief
justice,
we
raised
the
fact
that
we
believed
the
state
had
distorted
the
oregon
supreme
court's
previous
holding,
and
that
this
decision
should
be
readdressed
to
find,
or
to
address
the
fact
of
whether
the
criminality
was
irrelevant
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
i
can't
disagree
that
i
wish
they
had
discoursed
on
it
at
greater
length,
but
we
believe
that
statement
is
as
clear
as
you
can
find.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
yes.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
that
is
correct,
unless
it
is
job
related
or
is
involved
in
the
actual
firing
of
the
person.
they
said
the
first
time
you
have
to
look
in
the
oregon
unemployment
compensation
statutes
to
find
the
state
interest.
and
where
the
only
state
interest
is
the
fiscal
integrity
of
the
unemployment
fund,
criminality
has
no
place
in
the
federal
constitutional
inquiry.
now,
the
state,
and
we
conceded
this
in
our
brief,
could
choose
to
tie
legislatively
criminality
with
the
receipt
of
unemployment
benefits.
they
have
never
done
so.
or,
if
the
state
had
brought
a
criminal
prosecution,
then
the
criminality
of
the
ingestion
of
peyote
would
have
been
relevant
in
the
federal
constitutional
analysis.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
because
they
had
a
right
to
practice
their
religion
under
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
it
is,
yes,
in
either
form.
but
what
is
perhaps
not
here,
and
we
believe
it
is
not
necessary
to
address
the
criminality,
because
the
oregon
supreme
court
has
decided
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
that
is
correct.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
well,
we
have
a
dispute
about
that.
if
you
look
at
the
record
in
this
case--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--if
that
was
the
rule,
and
if
the
employee
knew
of
that
rule
when
they
were
hired,
then
the
state
could
validly
deny
unemployment
benefits.
but--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--no,
not...
only
if
the
interest
was
criminalized.
not
if...
under
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
even
where
an
employee
is
fired
for
misconduct;
all
the
previous
decisions,
the
employees
were
fired
for
misconduct,
anyone
else
in
their
situation
would
have
been
validly
denied,
been
denied
unemployment
benefits.
this
court
has
chosen
to
view
religious
beliefs,
and
i
believe
it
is
justice
stevens
who
said
this
in
both
the
goldman
case
and
the
hobbie
case,
as
equivalent
to
a
physical
impairment.
so
this
court
has
chosen
to
look
at
the
issue
as
whether
the
state
would
have
denied
benefits
to
other
people
with
a
similar
physical
impairment.
religious
belief
has
not
been
seen
to
be
a
voluntary
choice
by
this
court.
for
instance,
in
hobbie
the
court
rejected
the
state
of
florida's
view
that
the
respondent
or
the
claimant
in
that
case
had
come
voluntarily
to
the
religion.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
that's
right.
he
would
be
validly
denied
unemployment
benefits.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
it
is--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--it
is
the
religious
belief
that
changes
the
issue.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
well,
again--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--if
he
was--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--well,
if
he
was
denied--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--if
he
was
fired
for
misconduct,
yes.
and
i
want
to
get
to
that
point
very
clearly.
if
you
look
at
the
policies
of
the
employer
at
the
time
these
two
people
were
hired,
the
employer
policy
prohibited
misuse
and
abuse
of
illegal
drugs
and
substances
and
said
social
and
recreational
use
is
prohibited.
after
the
first
respondent,
galen
black,
used
peyote
and
was
fired,
the
employer
realized
that
their
policy
was
not
clear,
and
they
changed
their
written
policy.
it
is
that
second
written
policy
which
was
quoted
by
this
court
in
its
first
opinion.
so--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
yes,
but
we
think
it
is
disposed
of,
and
we
need
to
keep
reemphasizing
this
by
sherbert
and
thomas,
that
the
criminality
is
irrelevant.
if
the
criminality
is
relevant,
we
still
believe
that
the
state
has
not
met
their
test
under
the
first
amendment.
and
i
would
be
glad
to
move
to
that
issue.
the
state
has
failed
to
meet
its
burden
under
the
first
amendment
to
justify
what
we
believe
would
be
the
total
destruction
of
this
religion,
and
that
is
because
of
the
test
that
has
been
established
by
this
court
in
first
amendment
cases.
there
is
a
sincere
religious
belief,
it
is
a
bonafide
religion;
that
is
conceded
by
the
state.
but
once
that
is
shown,
the
state
must
show,
as
justice
o'connor
summarized
in
the
goldman
case,
that
the
interest
will
in
fact
be
substantially
harmed
by
granting
the
type
of
exemption
requested,
and
that
the
state
interest
will
be
undermined
by
granting
the
exemption,
and
there
is
no
less
restrictive
alternative
that
can
be
granted
in
this
case.
and
it
is
our
belief
that
the
state
cannot
meet
any
of
the
burdens
in
this
case.
the
compelling
state
interest
is
the
regulation
of
drug
abuse
generally,
but
we
do
not
have
any
evidence
in
this
case
that
peyote
has
been
abused
or
that
it
contributes
to
the
drug
abuse
problem.
in
fact,
all
of
the
evidence
is
to
the
contrary.
we
have
the
findings,
for
instance,
of
the
federal
agency
charged
with
enforcement
of
the
drug
laws
in
this
country,
which
found
that
and
concluded
that
the
religious
use
of
peyote
by
the
native
american
church
does
not
cause
a
law
enforcement
problem
in
this
country.
and
therefore
there
is
no
harm
that
is--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--well,
what
is
means
is,
and
they
listed
a
number
of
factors,
and
these
are
the
factors
which
we
believe
distinguishes
the
use
of
peyote
from
other
drugs,
the
amount
of
peyote
that
is
in
the
system.
for
instance,
they
found
that
the
entire
supply
of
peyote
is
now
used
in
bonafide
religious
ceremonies
of
the
native
american
church.
they
found,
for
instance,
that
the
marijuana
problem
in
the
united
states,
and
the
availability
of
marijuana
and
the
use
of
marijuana
was
a
much
larger
problem.
and
all
of
the
courts
that
have
addressed
it
have
found
that
no
accommodation
can
be
made
for
marijuana.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
that
is
correct.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
because
the
first
amendment,
i
believe,
requires
something
more
than
a
mere
legislative
statement
that
we
believe
it
may
be
harmful.
states
can
come
up
with
all
kinds
of
reasons
to
outlaw
all
kinds
of
conduct,
as
we
have
cited
in
our
supplemental
brief,
for
instance.
that
driving
of
amish
buggies
without
the
reflector
warning
system
is
certainly
a
dangerous
act.
but
if
you
allow
the
mere
legislative
proscription
without
an
actual
inquiry
into
whether
harm
has
in
fact
occurred,
then
you
are--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--i
would
not
accept
that.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
not
in
the
context
of
the
religious
service.
the
evidence
is
divided.
the
evidence
is
particularly
divided.
in
respect
to
this
church,
however,
there
is
reliable
scientific
evidence
that
the
use
of
peyote
in
the
ceremony
of
the
native
american
church
contributes
to
rehabilitation
of
people
who
have
problems
with
drug
and
alcohol
abuse.
so
the
evidence
is
mixed.
there
is
no
evidence
that
anyone,
and
we
need
to
keep
repeating
this,
over
300
years
or
more,
has
ever
suffered
harm.
there
is
one
or
two
anecdotal--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--well,
i
think
the
evidence
that
bigamy
was
harmful
in
the
1800s
perhaps
may
be
different
than
exists
today.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
well,
i
would
say
that
the
analysis
conducted
by
the
court
back
in
the
1800s
was
perhaps
different,
and
maybe
that
statute
would
not
be
upheld
in
the
present
day.
but--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--i
think
it
is
not
substantially
justified.
in
that
case
the
state,
or
the
united
states,
was
obviously
alleging
that
bigamy
was
harmful
to
society
in
the
united
states.
there
is
some
evidence,
for
instance,
that
the
beliefs
of
the
mormon
church
were
believed
to
be
so
outrageous
that
there
were
riots,
massacres,
and
other
things
that
occurred
as
the
mormon
church
moved
west
from
indiana
to
utah,
and
posed
a
substantial
and
actual
threat
to
public
order
at
that
time.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
no,
i
am
not
ask...
saying
that.
i
would
say
that
the
legislative
proscription
informs
the
constitutional
analysis,
but
it
is
certainly
not
a
conclusion
that
this
court
is
bound
by.
we
have
just
as
reliable
evidence
by
the
legislature
in
terms
of
granting
the
exemption,
we
cannot
presume
that
the
legislature
would
be
so
outrageous--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--all
it
did
was
adopt
the
schedule
i
listing
that
had
been
adopted
previously
by
the
federal
government.
and
that
listing,
in
its
legislative
history,
provided
an
express
exemption
for
the
native
american
church.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
that
is
correct.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
yes.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
well,
there
is
a
question.
the
state
disputes
whether
the
board
has
any
authority
to
grant
exemptions,
just,
for
instance,
under
the
federal
controlled
substances
act
there
is
no
express
authority
to
grant
exemptions.
the
native
american
church
was
exempted
only
because
it
was
listed
in
the
legislative
history.
the
federal
government
takes
the
position
that
that
is
a
unique
exemption,
and
is
of
no
precedential
value
for
any
other
exemptions.
the
board
of
pharmacy
did
exempt
the
religious
use
of
peyote.
that
exemption
was
withdrawn
upon
the
advice
of
the
attorney
general
that
it
might
violate
the
establishment
clause,
or
for
other
reasons.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
well,
i
have
two
points
of
response
to
that.
yes,
i
do
believe
it
would
be
required
under
normal
constitutional
analysis,
for
other
peyote
churches,
such
as
the
peyote
way
church
of
god,
which
have
the
same
exact
conditions
that
the
native
american
church
does.
and
there
are
a
number
of
conditions
that
go
to
that
that
show
that
this
church,
or
the
use
of
peyote,
is
unique.
however,--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--well,
see,
i
think
we
can
get
into
a
lot
of
examples,
and
i
don't
want
to
go
down
that
road
too
far
because
we
don't--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--have
the
facts
here.
[laughter]
but
the
fact
is,
and
a
number
of
courts
have
looked
at
marijuana,
and
they
have
concluded
that
marijuana
contributes
substantially
to
the
law
enforcement
problem.
that
has
been
the
distinguishing
factor
in
a
number
of
cases.
this
drug
does
not
contribute
to
the
law
enforcement
problem.
this
substance
is
used
by...
as
used
in
its
sacramental
purposes
by
the
church,
does
not
cause
those
problems.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
well,
why
is
the
law
not
enforced?
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
well
no,
not
just
because
the
law--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--well,
what
it
means
is
it
doesn't
contribute
to
the
use
of
other
drugs.
it
doesn't
undermine
the
federal
government
or
the
nation's
law
enforcement
efforts
for
other
drugs.
it
doesn't
get
into
the
distribution
system.
it
is
not
one
of
the
drugs
that
is
looked
to
by
other
people
as
a
recreational
substance.
mr.
craig
j.

peyote
itself?
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
the
state
can
look
at
it
as
the
problem
itself,
but
we're...
it
is
my
position,
strongly,
that
they
have
to
justify
that
position
by
showing
some
actual
harm.
otherwise
there
would
really
be
no
free
exercise
right,
because
the
state
could
outlaw
any
kind
of
conduct
and
say--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--so
long
as
it
does--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--well,
the
problem
is,
is
this
law
and
the
"neutral",
quote,
unquote,
prescription,
does
affect
a
particular
religion
only.
and
it
is
not,
this
court
said
in
yoder,
neutral
laws
may
in
its
application
have
an
affect
on
other,
on
particular--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--well,
for
instance,
a
better
example
i
thought,
the
state
is,
for
instance,
cited
to
a
case
outlawing
the
use
of
dangerous
snakes.
now,
that
is
a
legitimate
belief.
but,
for
instance,
what
happens
if
the
state
says
we
want
to
outlaw
all
use
of
snakes
by
religions.
and
you
have
a
religion
that
believes
that
garter
snakes,
the
common
garden
snake,
is
a
deity.
would
that
general
proscription
hold
up
where
you
have
an
overbroad
legislative
proscription,
and
it
is
not
necessary,
though,
in
this
particular
instance
of
this...
the
garter
snake
in
that
case.
and
we
would
hold,
and
this
court
has
hold,
that
the
proscription
must
be
narrowly
drawn
to
only
protect
the
interest
that
is
harmed,
not
the
general
interest
that
is
not
harmed.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
well,
that
would
certainly
be
a
large
step
in
the
right
direction.
if
there
are
some
snakes
that
have...
are,
for
instance,
are
poisonous,
but
you
can
show
one,
that
they
never
bite
people,
two,
that
the
effect
is
not
really
dangerous,
that
poison
is
not
dangerous,
then
even
in
that
case
i
would
say
you
should
not
outlaw
the
use
of
that
snake,
because
in
fact
it
is
not
causing
any
harm
to
people.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
yes.
all
of
the
cases--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--well,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
about
the
harm
that
rattlesnakes
can
cause.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
the
misuse
of
peyote,
no.
we
do
not
believe
the
circumscribed
ceremonial
use
of
this
peyote
constitutes
misuse
under
any
circumstances.
the
other--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--see,
this
is
one
of
the
problems
with
the
record
in
this
case.
the
normal,
generally-accepted
use
is
four
buttons,
as
it
goes
around...
the
use
of
peyote
goes
around
twice
during
the
ceremony.
people
can
choose
to
take
one
to
four
more
the
second
time
it
goes
around.
we
do
not
know,
the
use
varies
in
some
instances,
the
circumstances--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--if
it
could
be
shown
that
the
ingestion
of
a
large
number,
30
or
more
peyote
buttons,
caused
harm,
i
would
say
that
perhaps
the
state
could
limit
the
use
of
peyote
in
the
ceremony
to
a
smaller
amount
that
would
not
cause
those
problems.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
they
vary
among
people.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
no.
my
client
participates
in
them
once
or
twice
a
year.
some
people
participate
in
them...
the
chiefs,
road
chiefs
who
conduct
the
ceremonies,
do
them
once
a
week
in
different
settings.
i
think
the
normal
use
is
in
the
order
or
once
a
month
or
so.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
no.
it
has
not
been
shown
to
be
habit
forming
or
addictive
in
any
respect.
i
wanted
to
briefly
address
the
other
establishment
clause
issue,
and
that
is
the
second
reason
for
just
upholding
the
native
american
church
is
that
it's
a
federal
exemption
that
is
governed
by
the
united
states
trust
responsibility
to
indian
tribes.
that's
why
the
native
american
church
has
been
singled
out
in
the
legislative
history
and
in
the
american
indian
religious
freedom
act.
there
have
been
a
number
of
other
instances,
for
instance
the
bald
eagle
protection
act,
which
was
addressed
by
this
court
in
u.s.
v.
dion,
provides
an
exemption
for
the
religious
use,
indian
use,
of
eagle
feathers
for
indian
religious
purposes.
there
are
a
number
of
other
statutes.
the
indian
child
welfare
act,
which
was
addressed
by
this
court
earlier
in
the
year,
is
based
on
the
cultural
integrity
of
tribes.
the
indian
civil
rights
act
provides
an
express
exemption
from
the
establishment
clause
because
the
cultural
integrity
of
tribes
was
so
important.
we
don't
believe
it
is
necessary
to
address
that
issue
again
in
this
case,
but
we
certainly
believe
that
the
singling
out
of
one
church
in
this
case
is
based
on
the
federal
government's
relationship
with
indian
tribes.
and
that
is
why
they
have
singled
out
this
church.
oregon
supreme
court
only
exempted
the
native
american
church
because
that
was
the
only
church
before
it.
it
was
not
there
to
look
at
a
broad
exemption
for
all
churches,
and
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
first
amendment.
in
the
frazee
case,
the
court
said
we
realize
it
is
difficult
to
balance
between
different
religious
beliefs,
but
the
first
amendment
requires
it.
if
you
have
a
long
history,
if
you
have
organized
tenets
of
a
church,
it
makes
the
inquiry
easier,
but
that
does
not
get
rid
of
that
burden
on
this
court
or
other
courts,
if
those
organized
beliefs
aren't
there.
in
this
case
they
are
here,
there
is...
this
church
supports
the
state's
drug
enforcement
effort
in
every
respect.
the
tenets
of
the
church
believe
any
misuse
of
this
drug,
any
misuse
of
other
drugs
or
alcohol
is
sacrilegious.
and
so
there
is
no
disparity
between
the
beliefs
of
this
church,
we
believe,
and
the
beliefs
of...
the
interests
of
the
state
in
this
case.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
well,
the
problem
is,
this
is
only
ingested
in
a
ceremony
which
is
led
by
a
road
chief,
in
which
no
one
leaves--
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
--well,
see,
that
has
been
the
distinction
with
other
religions.
in
some
of
the
marijuana
religions,
for
instance,
they
believe
we
should
be
able
to
use
it
in
any
conditions
under
any
circumstances.
that,
of
course,
implicates
the
state's
law
enforcement
interest.
mr.
craig
j.
dorsay
it
is
used
in
the
ceremony,
but
it
is
also
used
for
medical
treatment
as
part
of
the
ceremony.
thank
you.
