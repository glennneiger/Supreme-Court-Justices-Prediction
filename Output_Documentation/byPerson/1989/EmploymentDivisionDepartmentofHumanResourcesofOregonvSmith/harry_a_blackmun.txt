mr.
attorney
general,
why
were
these
people
fired?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
what?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
they
were
fired
because
they
violated
the
employer's
policy.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
they
were
not
fired
because
the
use
of
peyote
was
illegal.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
we
really
have
no
question
of
illegality
before
us,
do
we?
