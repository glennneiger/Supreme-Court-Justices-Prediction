justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
frohnmayer,
the
oregon
supreme
court
really
didn't
tell
us
whether
the
oregon
constitution
would
have
been
violated
by
this
statute,
did
it?
we
still
don't
know
what
the
position
would
be
under
the
oregon
constitution.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has...
does...
do
we
know
whether
there
have
ever
been
any
criminal
prosecutions
in
oregon
under
the
statute
of
members
of
the
native
american
church
for
peyote
use?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
also
true
that
the
federal
government
and
some
23
states
exempt
peyote
use
from
their
drug
enforcement
schemes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
some
don't.
and
those
that
don't
you
would
say
are
invalid
under
the
establishment
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if...
if
the
contour
is
just
to
forgive
or
exempt
the
use
of
peyote
by
members
of
the
native
american
church,
you
would
then
be
back
here
arguing
that
that
violates
the
establishment
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
marijuana
use
by
a
church
that
uses
that
as
part
of
its
religious
sacrament?
