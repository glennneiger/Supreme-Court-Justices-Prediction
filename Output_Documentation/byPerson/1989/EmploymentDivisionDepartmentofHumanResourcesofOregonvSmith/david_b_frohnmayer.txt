mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
before
this
court
a
second
time.
the
first
question
was
whether
claimants
were
entitled
to
receive
unemployment
compensation
benefits
after
being
fired
as
drug
counselors.
it
is
undisputed
that
they
violated
their
employer's
job-related
rule
that
they
be
drug
free
because
they
ingested
peyote
in
the
ceremonies
of
the
native
american
church.
a
majority
of
this
court
held
that
the
claimants
were
not
entitled
to
unemployment
benefits
under
the
doctrine
of
sherbert
v.
verner
if
their
conduct,
even
if
religiously
motivated,
violated
a
valid
oregon
criminal
law.
after
the
oregon
supreme
court's
ultimate
decision
on
federal
grounds
on
remand,
the
question
is
this.
does
the
free
exercise
clause
require
every
state
to
exempt
the
religious
peyote
use
by
the
native
american
church,
or
perhaps
even
beyond
that,
other
substance
use
by
other
religions,
from
the
reach
of
generally
applicable
criminal
laws
regulating
the
use
of
controlled
substances
by
all
citizens?
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
in
footnote
3
of
the
oregon
supreme
court's
decision
on
remand,
justice
o'connor,
the
court
reserved
the
question
of
what
would
happen
in
a
fact-specific
criminal
prosecution
related
to
the
conduct
of
a
specific
person
arrested
and
prosecuted.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes,
we
do.
more
than
a
decade
ago,
in
a
case
called
state
v.
soto,
which
i
believe
is
described
in
our
briefs,
the
conviction
of
a
person
who
was
a
native
american
for
peyote
use
was
upheld,
criminal
prosecution,
and
certiorari
was
denied
by
this
court.
that
is
a
dozen
years
ago.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
believe
not,
justice
white,
but
i
will
try
to
refresh
my
memory
before
we
conclude
our
argument.
we
are
obviously
acutely
aware,
as
in
all
free
exercise
cases,
of
the
sensitive
interests
that
are
at
stake.
on
one
hand
we
recognize
that
this
is
a
genuine
church
with
doctrinal
beliefs
in
peyote
use
that
are
real.
the
church's
members
are
unquestionably
sincere,
and
the
adherents
generally...
genuinely
believe
that
the
existence
of
their
religion
is
threatened
if
they
are
not
free
to
use
this
substance.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
there
is
an
exemption
in
the
drug
enforcement
administration's
regulations
for
bonafide
use
by
the
native
american
church.
the
figure
of
23,
justice
o'connor,
we
believe,
is
wholly
inaccurate.
footnote
8
of
our
reply
brief
is
a
careful
parsing
of
the
states
that
provide,
either
by
legislative
exemption
or
judicial
decision,
an
exemption
for
religious
peyote
use,
sometimes
by
a
named
religion,
other
times
more
generically
referring
to
bonafide
religions.
but
the
number
by
our
count
is
closer
to
12
or
13.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
justice
scalia,
no,
the
exemptions
are
somewhat
scattered
in
terms
of
how
they
are
phrased.
for
example,
in
arizona
it
is
simply
a
defense
through
a
prosecution
rather
than
an
exemption
from
schedule
i,
and
it
refers
to
bonafide
use
of
peyote.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
am
sorry,
justice
white.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
by
the
bonafide
practice
of
a
religious
belief.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
is
right.
others...
in
fact,
i
would...
i
think
it
is
safe
to
say
the
majority
of
the
exemptions
single
out
the
native
american
church,
so--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--the
federal
exemption
is
limited
to
the
native
american
church.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
justice
scalia,
that
is
one--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--that
is
one
of
the
deeply
troubling
aspects
we
find
in
the
oregon
supreme
court's
decision,
because
there
is
another
church,
an
offshoot
of
this
church,
called
the
peyote
way
church
of
god,
which
also
has
many
native
american
members
and
which
has
strictly
controlled
religious
rights
which
a
lower
federal
court
has
denied
the
same
exemption
enjoyed
by
the
native
american
church.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
justice
rehnquist,
i...
i
would
be
somewhat
hesitant
to
answer
that
question,
because
that
is
more
properly
directed,
i
believe,
to
the
communicants
of
the
church.
it
is
safe
to
say
that
the
record
is
somewhat
obscure
on
this
point.
we
know
that
respondent
black--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
mr.
black
was
not
a
native
american.
we
believe
it
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
record
that
he
believed
that
he
was
a
member
of
the
native
american
church.
there
is
contradictory
evidence
in
the
record
concerning
whether
persons
other
than
native
americans
can
be
admitted
to
the
ritual,
at
least
if
they
don't
show
a
certain
amount
of
blood
lineage
from
native
american
ancestry.
and
in
fact
the
texas
statute
requires
a
minimum
of
25
percent.
other
statutes
are
much
vaguer
as
to
precisely
the
contours
of
the
membership
that's
required
in
this
religion.
let
me
turn
on
the
other
hand
to
the
fact
that
peyote
is
unquestionably
a
dangerous
and
powerful
hallucinogen.
government's
interest
in
controlling
peyote
and
similar
hallucinogens
is
real,
it
is
compelling,
and
it
is
evident
by
universal
and
pervasive
regulation.
there
are
other
religions
using
peyote,
and
there
are
other
religions
using
other
drugs
which
also
clamor
for
first
amendment
constitutional
exemptions--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--justice
kennedy,
we
know
that
it
is
found
in
normal
drug
distribution
channels,
although
not
in
great
amounts.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
mescaline,
as
we
understand
it,
can
be
produced
synthetically,
as
well
as,
of
course,
being
found
as
the
psychoactive
ingredient
in
peyote
itself.
in
fact,
the
only
thing
that
distinguishes
peyote
from
mescaline
is
the
presence
of
alkaloids
in
a
natural
way
in
the
peyote
button,
which
does
create
additional
effects
on
the
particular
user.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
the
best
evidence
for
that
is
in
material
at
least
tangential
to
the
record
and
in
other
lower
court
proceedings,
which
shows
that
the
dea
has
seized
some
19
pounds,
i
believe,
is
the
figure,
over
perhaps
the
period
of
a
decade.
so
that
shows
at
least--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--from
sources
apparently
other
than
native
americans.
that
is
not
clear
from
the
dea's
reports.
however,
we
would
assume
that
they
would
be
reporting
illegal
trafficking,
as
opposed
to
that
which
they
regulate.
the
oregon
supreme
court's
resolution
of
the
federal
law
question,
we
believe,
seriously
compromises
three
compelling
and
intersecting
state
interests.
the
first
is
the
state's
interest
in
regulating
all
peyote
and
hallucinogenic
drug
use
to...
in
order
to
further
the
health
and
safety
interests
of
its
citizens.
the
second
is
the
state's
interest
in
a
regulatory
scheme
as
a
whole,
so
that
law
enforcement
does
not
face
a
patchwork
of
exemptions
of
other
drugs
on
a
drug-by-drug,
religion-by-religion,
believer-by-believer
basis.
and
the
third
and
compelling
interest
is
that
the
state
constitution's
heightened
requirement
of
neutrality
in
our
jurisdiction,
requires
it
to
avoid
giving
the
preference
of
one
church
over
another.
let
me
then
examine
these
concerns
in
order.
peyote,
by
all
accounts,
is
a
powerful
and
unpredictable
hallucinogen.
that
fact
is
largely
conceded
even
by
respondents,
at
least
for
the
public
generally,
and
it
is
amply
illustrated
by
the
record.
its
active
ingredient
is
mescaline.
it
stimulates
respiratory
changes,
reflexes
and
pulse
rates,
which
are
physiologically
measurable.
the
spectrum
of
effects
experienced
are
similar,
and
in
most
respects
identical,
to
those
of
lsd,
psilocybin,
and
mescaline,
accompanied
by
vivid
visual
and
auditory
hallucinations,
altered
perceptions
of
time,
space
and
body...
emotional
reactions
that
range
from
joy
and
exhilaration
to
extreme
anxiety
and
even
terror.
there
is
no
way
to
predict,
even
for
the
experienced
user,
how
the
user
will
react
on
a
given
occasion.
there
are
effects
on
the
central
nervous
system
and
behavior
which
cause
inability
to
distinguish
reality
and
non-reality.
and
it
does
induce
psychotic
reactions
in
a
small
number
of
users.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
it
is
said,
justice
blackmun,
and
i
am
now
trying
to
recall
from
memory
precisely,
that
the
effect
may
last
as
long
as
12
hours.
to
quote
from
the
record
in
smith's
case
exhibit
8
from
a
clinical
substance
special...
abuse
specialist,
it
is
a
powerful
and
potent
agent
which
does
sometimes
have
long-lasting
negative
effects
on
its
user,
with
no
predictability
as
to
when
that
can
happen.
it
is
"very
risky".
the
record
is
consistent
with
what
is
known
generally
about
this
substance,
and
why
every
jurisdiction
in
the
country
regulates
it
intensely.
it
is
almost
universally
a
schedule
i
drug,
which
means
that
it
has
a
high
potential
for
abuse.
there
is
no
currently
accepted
medical
use,
and
there
is
lack
of
accepted
safety
for
use
even
under
medical
supervision.
the
experiences
under
the
influence
of
this
substance
may
be
good,
but
they
are
unpredictable,
and
they
are
indifferent
to
the
motives
of
the
user.
the
risk
is
largely
unquestioned
by
respondents,
and
the
risk
cannot
be
meaningfully
distinguished
from
the
risk
of
using
any
other
hallucinogen.
these
dangers
are
great
enough
that
oregon
has
chosen,
with
respect
to
any
user,
to
have
a
blanket
regulation
without
exemption.
in
the
face
of
these
considerations,
the
oregon
supreme
court
has
concluded,
however,
that
the
federal
constitution
commands
a
judicially
crafted
exemption
for
sincere
adult
users
of
a
single
church.
and
this
poses
for
us
a
dilemma.
on
the
one
hand,
if
the
exemption
is
crafted
so
narrowly
that
it
applies
to
one
group
on
a
de
minimis
basis,
then
that
means
that
our
state
and
federal
constitutions
have
preferred
one
religion
over
another,
and
hopelessly
compromised
the
constitution
requirements
of
neutrality.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
am
sorry,
justice?
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no,
we
think
not.
because
there,
in
yoder,
the
church
was
not
singled
out
by
name
and
by
identity
and
by
denomination,
and
there
were
no
others
similarly
situated
who
were
clamoring
for
that
particular
exemption.
yoder
is
a
case
which
is
distinguishable,
obviously,
on
many
other
important
grounds,
and
i
can
reach
them
now.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
we
think
the
problem
is
compounded
when
a
legislature
singles
it
out,
because
the
judicial
exemption
is
free
of
broader
interpretation,
whereas,
if
the
legislature
in
its
plenary
judgment
has
singled
out
a
specific
church,
we
believe
it
has,
in
many
respects,
potentially
run
afoul
of
the
establishment
clause
unless
it
treats
other
religions
clamoring
for
equal
treatment
on
similar
grounds
in
similar
ways.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no,
we
are
not.
we
did
not
come
to
this
court
to
argue
that
giving
an
exemption
in
some
form
or
another
is
an
impermissible
state
act
in
the
exercise
of
its
plenary
authority.
our
argument
is
simply
that
the
free
exercise
clause
does
not
command
every
state
in
this
union,
as
apparently
our
oregon
supreme
court
would
command,
to
craft
an
exemption
singling
out
a
specific
church.
some
of
those
state
exemptions,
as
we
pointed
out,
justice
stevens,
do
speak
neutrally
with
respect
to
bonafide
religious
practices.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
think
we
would
need
to
know
more.
and
what
more
we
would
need
to
know
is
whether,
if
a
court
were
faced
with
a
claim
by
another
religion
that,
notwithstanding
the
specific
named
claim
of
the
particular
communicants
of
one
church,
if
it
denied
it
to
another,
then
perhaps
that
might
implicate
the
establishment
clause
because
it
would
have
closed
the
doors
to
others
achieving
this
equally.
so,
i
believe
our
position
is
that
we
would
have
to
wait
for
a
case-by-case
determination
to
see
whether
those
jurisdictions
would
open
their
doors
to
other
claims,
if
properly
advanced
by
other
religions.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
am
sorry,
justice?
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
is
correct.
and
this
is
not
a
theoretical
issue
for
the
state
of
oregon,
because
we
have
pending
in
our
appellate
courts
a
case
which
in
many
ways
is
on
all
fours
with
this,
in
which
sincere
religious
communicants
who
believe
that
their
use
of
marijuana
is
religiously
inspired,
have
asked
for
exemption
from
oregon's
drug
laws.
and
that's
part
of
the
problem.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
justice
scalia,
that
is
one
of
the
major
reasons
we
have
brought
this
case
to
this
court
for
a
second
time,
which
is,
we
are
asked,
we
believe,
not
merely
to
see
this
as
one
case,
but
it
is
in
fact
the
thin
end
of
the
wedge
in
which
analytical
distinctions
are
extremely
difficult
to
draw,
and
in
which
claims
certainly
will
be
made,
as
they
have
been
made
in
lower
courts
with
increasing
frequency,
for
other
drugs
and
other--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--that's
a
different
question.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
the
issue
of
sacramental
wine
is
different
because,
at
least
at
the
present,
it
is
not
a
schedule
i
substance.
the--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--but
there...
there
might
be
a
religious
accommodation
argument
of
an
entirely
different
order
than
is
presented
here.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with...
it
is
religion
indifferent.
even
during
prohibition
there
was
a
statutory
exemption
for
the
use
of
sacramental--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--there,
an
argument
for
accommodation
is
stronger,
stronger
in
at
least
two
respects.
first
is
that
there...
that
to
the
extent
that
this
court
examines
or
re-examines
the
nature
of
the
compelling
state
interest
and
the
potential
danger
of
the
ingestion
of
sacramental
wine
in
small
quantities,
it
might...
might
well
question
whether
the
state's
over
all
interest
in
regulation
of
a
very
dangerous
substance--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--it
could
be
a
different
case.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
the
second
is
clearly
that
the
use
of
peyote
in
the
ceremonies
is
at
least
in
part
for
its
very
hallucinogenic
properties.
that
is
to
say,
the
religious
experience,
at
least
for
some
communicants,
comes
from
the
achievement
of
the
heightened
hallucinogenic
effect,
where
this
is
also
not
true
of
the
ingestion
of
sacramental
wine
in
small
quantities.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
well,
the
feeling
is
different
than
the
induction
of
an
actual
altered
state
of
consciousness.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
those
two
factors
at
least
distinguish,
and
would
presumably
cause
this
court
or
any
other
to
say
that
the
argument
for
accommodation
is
much
stronger
in
the
case
of
those
religious
sacraments
than
in
the
case
where
it
is
unquestionably
a
very
dangerous
substance
for
everyone
else,
acknowledged
and
conceded
to
be,
and
where
it
is
taken
for
the
purposes
of
inducing
the
very
state
that
causes
the
danger,
at
least
with
respect
to
everyone
else.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
i
think
that
would
be
a
very,
that
would
be
a
much
closer
case,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes,
indeed
it
would.
we
believe
that
it
is
ironic
that
while
respondents
concede
that
the
use
of
a
schedule
i
drug
is
dangerous
as
to
everyone
else,
it
is
safe
as
to
them.
and
the
burden,
we
believe,
lies
properly
on
respondents
to
show
convincingly
why
the
dangers
of
the
drug
use,
or
substance
use,
are
less
as
to
them.
if
there
is
to
a
judicially
crafted
exemption,
we
are
entitled
to
know
who
uses,
with
what
frequency,
in
what
amounts,
for
what
purposes,
and
in
what
concrete
ways
do
those
uses
reduce
the
risk.
that
is
the
nature
of
the
state's
undoubted
compelling
interest.
the
record
provides
us
no
security.
the
sources
cited
in
our
reply
brief
are
for...
almost
universally
the
same
sources
cited
by
respondents
or
their
amici
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
the
practices.
they
show
considerable
variation
in
the
ritual,
in
the
dosage,
in
the
membership,
and
yet
no
real
information
as
to
how
the
underlying
danger
of
the
substance
or
harm
is
in
fact
avoided.
what
we
do
know
about
the
religious
use
of
the
substance
is
the
same
thing
we
know
about
the
use
of
peyote
for
anyone.
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
risk
to
the
user.
it's
use
is
inconsistent
with
the
government's
compelling
interest
in
preventing
a
known
hazard
to
anyone.
and
if
on
this
ambiguous
and
incomplete
record
it
suffices
to
exempt
under
the
free
exercise
clause
this
substance,
many
other
religious
users
can
make
identical
claims
persuasive
to
a
court
and
to
a
legislature.
but
there
is
a
second
reason--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--it
is
argue--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--no.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no,
i
meant
it
on
quite
a
different
basis,
and
it
is
responsive,
i
think,
to
an
argument
of
amici
and
perhaps
others,
that
what
we
have
is
a
small
group
of
sincere...
religious
believers
of
deep
conviction,
and
that
to
make
an
exception
in
their
case
would
not
compromise
the
interests
of
the
state.
the
problem
is,
of
course,
that
the
other
interests
are
compromised
by
the
other
claims
of
others
equally
entitled.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
again,
bearing
in
mind
the
admonition
that
it
is
not
government's
role
to
explore
the
centrality
of
religious
practices
of
a
belief,
the
record
would
fairly
reveal
that
a
hallucinogenic
dose
of
four
is
common,
and
that
ingestion
of
between
eight
and
30
of
the
peyote
buttons
is
common.
beyond
that
the
anthropological
literature
and
the
other
literature
cited
by
both
parties
is
somewhat
variable.
but
it
does
seem
clear
that
there
is
no
uniformly
prescribed
amount,
nor
any
real
control
over
the
number
of
peyote
buttons
that
may
be
ingested
by
communicants
at
the
particular
religious
ceremony.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
they
were
fired
because
they
were
drug
counselors.
their--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--they
were
drug
counselors.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
at
a
drug
and
alcohol
treatment
center.
their
employer
had
a
drug
and
alcohol
free
policy--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--that
is
right.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
is
correct.
and
it
would
not
be
a
proper
ground
in
oregon
to
fire
them
simply
because
their
underlying
conduct...
their
conduct
was
otherwise
illegal.
they
were
fired
for
the
statutory
purpose
upheld
by
the
employment
appeals
board
of
engaging
in
misconduct
at
their
work,
because
it
was
a
drug
and
alcohol
free
policy,
consistent
with
the
policy
of
many
drug
and
alcohol
rehabilitation
centers,
that
they
act
as
role
models
for
those
whom
they
were
counseling.
that
was
a
valid
job-related
requirement.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
the
illegality
comes
by
virtue
of
the
question
posed
on
remand
by
the
majority
of
this
court,
which
is
another
way
of
saying
that
it
is
a
way
to
distinguish
this
case
from
sherbert
v.
verner
and
its
progeny.
because
in
none
of
its
pro...
sherbert
or
its
progeny,
was
the
underlying
conduct
which
could
constitute
the
legitimate
state
interest
actually
contrary
to
a
state
law,
let
alone
to
a
state
criminal
law.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
no,
we
think
not.
we
think
that
the
aclu
amicus
brief
simply
misread,
and
clearly
misread,
the
oregon
supreme
court's
opinion
on
remand,
which
did
not
reiterate
its
past
holding
as
its
present
holding,
it
simply
repeated,
in
the
past
tense,
what
it
had
held.
and
then
went
on
reach,
quite
properly,
the
questions
posed
by
this
court
on
remand
as
to
whether
or
not
the
federal
interest
in
free
exercise
demanded
a
specific
exemption.
moreover,
the
oregon
court's
reasoning
would
hopelessly
insulate
any
federal
court,
holding
of
a
state
court,
from
review
by
this
court,
as
we
have
argued
i
think...
i
believe
persuasively
in
our
reply
brief.
the
notion
that
the
state's
interest
must
be
cabined
and
confined
within
the
unemployment
laws
suggests
that
they
have
to
incorporate
by
reference
every
other
prohibitory
statute.
and
that,
that
to
us
is
an
absurd
reading
of
what
the
oregon
court
would
have
said.
we
believe
it
did
not
say
that,
it
simply
referred--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--either
because
they
did
not
believe
it
was
dispositive
of
this
court's
question
to
it
on
remand,
or
because
they
believed,
more
properly
as
we
conclude
from
the
decision
in
smith
i
in
the
oregon
supreme
court,
that
in
fact
there
would
not
be
an
entitlement
to
benefits
under
the
oregon
constitution.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes.
the
question--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--that
is
correct.
but
in
both
cases
the
court
reached
out
to
decide
the
issue
on
federal
grounds.
and
you
are
quite
right,
justice
stevens,
that
of
any
court
in
the
country
ours
is
the
most
conscious
of
putting
first
a
state
constitutional
consideration
if
it
is
relevant
to
decision
of
the
case.
but
the
court
did
not
choose
to
reach
the
federal...
the
state
ground,
or
perhaps
concluded
sub
silentio
that
the
state
ground
was
not
dispositive
of
the
case.
and
that's
why
the
federal
issue
is
squarely
before
us
again.
let's
make
one
other
point.
that
is,
we
have
a
claim
by
respondent
that
line
drawing
of
the
kind
that
we
find
so
objectionable
in
pursuit
of
our
interests
in
religious
neutrality
is
easy.
and
we
point
to
the
lower
federal
court
cases
suggesting
that
other
persons
using
peyote,
other
persons
using
hashish,
lsd
or
marijuana
for
sincere
religious
reasons,
that
those
cases
can
be
easily
distinguished.
we
simply
invite
this
court's
careful
review
of
those
cases,
which
are
shamelessly
result-driven
and
involve
religious
gerrymandering
from
which
no
consistent
neutral
principle
emerges.
and
our
point
is
that
if
we
cannot
accommodate
on
equal
grounds,
then
the
requirement
of
accommodation
must
fail.
and
there
is
a
final
and
critical
point
here
related
to
our
health
and
safety
interest.
that
is
that
denominational
practices,
and
indeed
individual
believers,
even
in
long-standing
religions,
can
and
do
change.
they
change
the
nature
of
their
religious
beliefs,
they
change
the
nature
of
their
doctrine,
and
that
is
the
very
essence
of
freedom
of
religion
and
belief.
so
a
constitutional
exemption
that
is
bound
in
time
and
place
is
very
risky.
if
we
exempt
a
practice,
even
if
we
are
presently
satisfied
by
its
safety,
control
passes
forever
into
private
hands.
and
that
is
proper.
but
then
we
must
ask,
before
we
let
that
control
pass
in
the
form
of
a
constitutional
exemption,
denomination
specific
or
not,
now
and
in
the
future,
what
are
the
contours
of
that
exemption
and
how
will
it
be
conferred.
because
if
the
denominational
or
church
controls
weaken
or
change,
there
are
still
enshrined
in
the
bill
of
rights
a
permanent
exemption
for
the
practices
of
that
religion.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
we
don't
concede
that,
justice
kennedy,
for
a
very
practical
reason.
the
oregon
criminal
prohibition,
construed
as
constitutional
by
the
oregon
court
of
appeals
since
state
v.
soto,
has
been
on
the
books
for
more
than
a
decade.
there
is
no
suggestion
in
our
state
that
that
religion
has
been
destroyed
by
inappropriate
police
intrusion
into
the
tepee
ceremony.
in
most--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--we
are--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--we
have
had
priorities
in
police
enforcement
that
are
understandable
in
terms
of
what
is
at
stake.
this,
this--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--no,
we
are
not
saying
that.
we
are
saying
that,
reading
carefully
and
thoughtfully
footnote
3
of
the
oregon
supreme
court's
opinion
on
remand,
as
justice
o'connor
has
called
to
our...
the
court's
attention,
there
may
be,
in
the
specific
context
of
the
specific
use
by
a
person
accused
of
a
specific
crime,
special
state
constitutional
restrictions
on
the
state
which
have
not
yet
been
explored.
we
do
not
know
the
contours
of
those
exemptions.
but
moreover,
to
answer
your
question
generally--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--if
the
defense
were
that
the
specific
church
and
that
church
only
was
entitled
to
the
exemption,
that
would
very
probably
be
the
case,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
yes,
justice
white,
it's
so
intuitively
obvious
that
drug
counselors
ought
not
to
be
partaking
of
the
substances
which
they
are
asking
others
to
refrain
from,
that
of
course
we
would.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
if
i
may.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
two
points
on
oregon
law.
the
case
of
state
v.
soto
which
is
relevant
to
my
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
decision,
the
court
did
not
address
the
oregon
constitution,
and
that
was
probably
prior
to
a
time
at
which
state
and
federal
constitutional
claims
were
separately
considered.
with
respect
to
the
question
propounded
by...
to
opposing
counsel,
the
question
of
benefits
and
the
entitlement
of
respondents
to
benefits
under
the
state
law
and
under
the
state
constitution
was
fully
settled
by
the
oregon
supreme
court
before
this
court
ever
reached
this
case
in
smith
v....
smith
i.
so
the
state
constitutional
entitlement
to
benefits,
putting
aside
the
criminal
law
issue,
is
settled
law,
it
is,
as
the
chief
justice
said,
water
over
the
dam
in
terms
of
what
the
state
law
ruling
was
on
misconduct
and
whether
that
is
covered
by...
or
protected,
by
the
state
constitution.
it
is
not.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
that
is
correct.
that
is
the
only
reason
we
are
here
at
this
court
is
because--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--that
is
correct.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
and
we
hope
that
you
do
not.
it
is
clear
that--
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
--that's...
and
we
believe
that
a
different
answer
would
have
been
forthcoming
on
remand,
because
we
believe
that
it
is
relevant
and
it
is
a
distinguishing
factor.
third
is
a
factual
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
is
that
it
is
generally
agreed
that
the
ingestion
of
four
buttons
of
peyote
is
sufficient
to
induce
a
hallucinogenic
state.
both
petitioners
and
respondents
cite
essentially
the
same
anthropological
and
sociological
studies
in
terms
of
the
variabilities
of
this
practice.
they
are
referred
to
in
our
briefs,
and
we
would
refer
this
court
to
our
reply
brief
in
terms
of
citations
to
the
authorities
which
would
describe
the
variations
in
ceremonies.
mr.
david
b.
frohnmayer
at
the
very
least
it
is
alive
because
of
that,
and
also
because
there
is
on
the
books
a
very
adverse
precedent
decided
by
the
oregon
supreme
court
purporting
to
construe
federal
law
in
a
way
which
we
believe
is
not
consistent
with
the
teachings
of
this
court.
thank
you
very
much.
