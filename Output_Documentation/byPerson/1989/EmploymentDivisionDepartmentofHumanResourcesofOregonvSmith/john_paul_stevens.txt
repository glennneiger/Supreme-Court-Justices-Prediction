justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
arguing
that
the
23...
or
it
isn't
23
under
your
figures,
but
whatever
the
number
of
states
is
that
grant
exemptions,
those
exemptions
all
violate
the
establishment
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it,
then,
that
your
flat
rule
position
would
permit
a
state
to
outlaw
totally
the
use
of
alcohol,
including
wine,
in
religious
ceremonies?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
that
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
state
certainly
could
prohibit
the
use...
the
consumption
of
alcohol
within
its
borders,
or
at
least
the
sale
or
use
of
alcohol.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean,
just
a
better-known
religion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
what
i
am
asking
is
supposing
a
state
did
not
give
that
statutory
exemption.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
this
were
a
schedule
iv
substance
it
would
be
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
there
is
any
special
spiritual
feeling
in
taking
communion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
may
i
ask
one
question
here
that
i
still
can't
quite
figure
out?
is
there
any
explanation,
either
in
the
argument
on
remand
or
in
part
of
the
record
that
i
am
not
familiar
with,
why
the
oregon
supreme
court,
which
has...
many
times
say
they
decide
state
constitutional
issues
before
federal,
and
justice
lindy
has
written
on
this,
why
didn't
they
do
that
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
wasn't
actually
held
in
that
case,
and
it
is
rather
strange
that
they
were
totally
silent
on
the
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
had
they
ruled
the
other
way,
or
had
they
ruled
the
way
they
did
on
the
oregon
constitution,
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
the
ball
game.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
dorsay,
under
that
analysis,
is
there
any...
can
we
possibly
defend
the
state
laws
that
prohibit
bigamy?
what
is
the
evidence
that
bigamy
is
harmful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
the
evidence
then?
it
was
against
a
lot
of
people's
religious
and
moral
beliefs,
but
did
anybody
ever
prove
it
was
harmful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that
is
the
logic
of
your
position,
that
that
statute
probably
falls,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
riots
probably
were
the
result
of
the
fact
that
they
were
a
persecuted
group.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
on
that,
on
that
subject
you
earlier
suggested
that
the
outcome
of
this
case
may
result
in
the
total
destruction
of
this
religion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
much
more
likely
that
there
will
continue
to
be
exemptions
in
the
states
which
have
allowed
them,
and
as
i
understand
it,
there
are
proceedings
pending
in
oregon
to
grant
exemptions...
doesn't
some
board,
a
state
board,
have
authority
to
grant
an
exemption
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
might
moot
this
litigation,
i
suppose.
well,
would
you...
wouldn't
you
think
that
the
same
exemption
would
be
required
for
other,
other
sincere
claims
that
the
use
of
peyote
is
part
of
their
religion?
