justice
scalia
well,
you
could...
you
could
argue
it
that
way.
but
you
could...
you
could
also
argue
that...
that
prejudice
is
an
available
sanction
where
it's
an
available
sanction
and
that
it's
simply
not
available
where
there's
been
a
timely
dismissal
before
an
answer
has
been
filed.
why
can't
you
say
it's
simply
not
available
under
rule
11
where
there's
been
a
rule
41
dismissal?
justice
scalia
yeah.
it
would
be
logical.
it
would
be
a--
justice
scalia
mr.
saltzburg,
i
thought
that
collateral
estoppel
requires
that
the
found
facts
have
been
necessary
to
the...
to
the
earlier
decision.
the
court
cannot,
in
the
course
of
an
opinion,
opine
on
facts
that
are
not
essential
to
its
decision
and
thereby
collaterally
estop
someone.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
i
don't
see
how
any
facts
must
be
found
for
a
rule
11
decision.
no
objective
facts
need
be
found.
all
that
need
be
found
is
whether
the
lawyer
had
knowledge
that
certain
facts
were
in
existence
and
conducted
adequate
investigation
to
acquire
knowledge.
so,
i
don't
see
how
there
can
be
any
collateral
effect--
justice
scalia
--as
to
what
the
objective
facts
are.
justice
scalia
to
the
extent
it
is
it
does
not
have
any
collateral
estoppel
effect
because
it's...
it's
not
essential
to
the
judgment.
justice
scalia
i...
i
really
can't
understand
this
argument
that
you've
made
in
your
brief.
you...
you
think
that...
that
someone
who
is
about
to
be
sued
in
court
has
an
obligation
to
the
other
side
to
make
sure
that
the
other
side's
complaint
is
accurate?
justice
scalia
i
think
it's
your
obligation
to
make
sure
it's
accurate,
and
the
other
side
is
fully
intended
to
say:
you
want
to
file
it?
take
your
chances.
and
you
did
and
you
lost.
that
seems
to
me
the
way
the
system
ought
to
work.
justice
scalia
play
cat
and
mouse.
just
don't
bring
a
lawsuit
unless
you're
sure
that
there
are
substantial
facts...
not
necessarily
true,
but
substantial
facts
to
support
it.
i
don't
call
that
cat
and
mouse.
justice
scalia
well,
i...
i
liked
the
way
you
put
it
earlier.
you
said
that
clearly
erroneous
is
abuse
of
discretion
as
applied
to
factual
determinations.
justice
scalia
but
most
of
these
abuse
of
discretion
things
have
some
factual
judgments,
they
have
some
discretion
as
to
remedy,
which
are
not
factual.
but
insofar
as
it's
factual,
you...
you
wouldn't
say
that
discretion
has
been
abused
unless
there's
a
clear
error,
would
you?
justice
scalia
are
you
going
to
talk
about
the
award
of
fees
for
the
appellate
litigation?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
why
can't
you
leave
that
up
to
the
district
judge?
in
these
other
situations
you
have
a
statute
and...
and
you
have
to
treat
it
uniformly.
here
you
have
a
district
judge
who
has
made
the
fee-shifting
determination.
why
may
he
not
in
some
cases
say,
i'll
give
you
only
the
costs
here
in
the
district
court,
and
in
other
cases
say,
i'll
give
you
the
costs
all
the
way?
justice
scalia
that's
right.
just
as...
just
as
he
can
do
that,
why
can't
he--
justice
scalia
--say
just...
just
costs
in
the
district
court,
not
on
appeal?
justice
scalia
suppose
he
said
no...
no
appellate
fees?
justice
scalia
you
made
the
argument
in...
in
your
brief
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
the
fees
on
appealing
these
things
would
be
greater
than
the
fees
to
be
recovered
from
the--
justice
scalia
--especially
in
a
rule
41
situation,
i
would
assume.
justice
scalia
in
this
particular
case
is
that...
do
you
have
any
idea
whether
that's
so?
whether--
justice
scalia
--but
if...
if
you
don't
get
your
appellate...
fees
for
the
appellate
litigation,
you...
your
client
ends
up...
ends
up
in
the
whole,
or
you
do?
justice
scalia
somebody
does.
