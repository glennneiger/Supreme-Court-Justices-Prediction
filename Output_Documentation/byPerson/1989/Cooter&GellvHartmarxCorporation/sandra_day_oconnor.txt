justice
o'connor
what
standard
do...
do
you
think
the
court
of
appeals
used,
mr.
saltzman?
it
isn't
real
clear
to
me
from
the
court's
opinion
what
the
standard
was?
justice
o'connor
mr.
salzman,
would
a
court,
a
district
court,
have
continued
power
to
go
after
a
lawyer
on
a
contempt
sanction
after
a
voluntary
dismissal?
justice
o'connor
well,
how
is
that
different
in
any
way
from
a
rule
11
sanction
which
does
seem
to
be
one
designed
to
address
what
the
attorney
did,
not
what
the
client
did
so
much?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
don't
see
why
you
need
an
exception.
rule
11,
just
like
contempt
proceedings,
is
addressed
to
something
else
and
the
language
is
there,
and
i
fail
to
understand
why
a
dismissal
under
rule
41
should
have
any
effect
on
a
sanction
motion
against
the
lawyer.
justice
o'connor
what's
that?
justice
o'connor
without
prejudice?
justice
o'connor
the
words
"without
prejudice"?
justice
o'connor
but
doesn't
that
just
refer
to
the
right
to
file
another
lawsuit?
i
don't
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
whether
the
attorney
should
be
sanctioned.
justice
o'connor
well,
but--
justice
o'connor
well,
that
was
certainly
unfortunate
and
perhaps
the
courts
need
to
tighten
up
on
additional
rules
or
times
to
act
on
things.
but
i
don't
know
that
that
answers
the
question
you
bring
to
us.
justice
o'connor
--shouldn't
the
sanctions
at
least
be
imposed
within
a
reasonable
time?
is
there
no
time
limit
there?
that
was
a
rather
strange
proceeding
here?
justice
o'connor
did
the
appellate
court
apply
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
do
you
think?
justice
o'connor
and
what
standard
do
you
tell
us
should
be
applied?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if--
--go
ahead.
i'm
sorry.
what
if
the
question
is
whether
the
filing
of
the
complaint
was
warranted
by
a
good
faith
argument
for
the
extension,
modification
or
reversal
of
existing
law?
justice
o'connor
now,
does
that
pose
some
kind
of
mixed
law
of
fact
question?
justice
o'connor
and
you
think
even
there
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard--
justice
o'connor
well,
did
the
court
below
hold
that
appellate
expenses
must
be
awarded
in
a
reasonable
amount
if
the
sanction
is
affirmed?
justice
o'connor
as
an
automatic
sort
of
thing?
justice
o'connor
well,
that
certainly
is
kind
of
a
disincentive
to
non-frivolous
appeals,
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
certainly
we
saw
fit
to
take
the
case
here.
it
poses
issues
that
need
to
be
resolved.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
understand
why
there
should
be
some
automatic
rule
in
any
event.
