mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
unlike
the
first
case
before
you
this
morning,
this
one
does
not
involve
the
constitution.
it
involves
rules
of
procedure
for
civil
cases
in
the
united
states
district
courts
and
the
rules
governing
appeals
in
the
united
states
courts
of
appeals.
and
lawyers
arguing
about
such
rules
face
the
unique
task
of
arguing
to
you
about
what
you
probably
meant,
must
have
meant,
when
you
considered
rules
submitted
to
you
by
the
advisory
committee,
the
standing
committee,
the
judicial
conference,
and
you
approved
them
for
submission
to
the
congress
and
they
were
in
fact
effective
upon
the
completion
of
the
rules
enabling
act
process.
although
not
rising
to
the
level
of
constitutional
issues,
we
submit
that
the
three
questions
before
you
this
morning
may
have
an
enormous
impact
on
the
availability
of
legal
services
to
clients
throughout
this
country
who
bring
to
lawyers
every
day
cases
and
ask
them
to
carry
those
cases
to
court
and
the
lawyers
are
confronted
with
the
responsibility
of
doing
justice
to
the
clients
and
meeting
their
duties
to
the
court,
particularly
duties
imposed
now
by
the
current
state
of
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
11.
the
briefs
of
the
parties
in
this
case,
as
well
as
the
briefs
of
the
amici
curiae,
have
addressed
the
facts
at
some
length
and
i
choose
not
to
do
that
this
morning
unless
the
court
wishes.
i
would
like
to
spend
a
moment
or
two
on
the
facts
because
they
lay
the
groundwork
for
the
three
issues
that
i
would
like
to
address.
briefly,
the
facts
are
as
follows.
the
litigation
that
resulted
in
sanctions
began
as
a
suit
on
a
contract
brought
by
a
subsidiary
of
the
hartmarx
company
against
a
client
of
petitioner...
petitioner's
law
firm
cooter
&
gell.
this
suit
was
met
with
a
counterclaim,
a
robinson-patman
counterclaim,
and
thus
began
the
litigation
that
ended
up
in
this
court
with
the
sanctions
issue.
as
the
investigation
into
the
counterclaim
took
place
and
facts
were
gathered,
petitioner
discovered
what
it
believed
to
be
serious
antitrust
violations,
broad
robinson-patman
violations
in
a
number
of
cities
around
the
united
states.
and
allegations
by
its
client,
a
clothing
company,
distributor
of
men's
clothing
that
had
done
business
at
various
locations
since
1969
in
washington,
d.c.,
that
hartmarx
company
and
two
of
its
principle
subsidiaries
had
engaged
not
only
in
robinson-patman
violations,
but
it
engaged
in
price
fixing
that
was
supported
by
an
exclusive
dealer
arrangement.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
mr.
chief
justice,
what's
clear
is...
is
the
following.
that
the
petitioner
represented
to
the
district
court
that
its
investigation
was
based
upon
allegations
made
by
its
client.
and
if
i
might
elaborate,
the...
the...
on
that
little
bit
because
the
record
in
this
case
is
not
the
record
that
i
would
like
to
have
before
you,
and
i--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--it
is
the
record
we
must
deal
with
and...
and
the
reason
for
that
is
rule
11
had
just
taken
effect
in
its
revised
form
in
august
of
1983.
the
complaint
in
this
case,
the
class
action
complaint
which
gave
rise
to
sanctions,
was
filed
barely
three
months
thereafter
and
this
was
one
of
the
early
sanctions
cases.
when
the
complaint
was
filed
in
this
case,
it
was
met
with
a
rule
12(b)(6)
motion
to
dismiss
and
almost
immediately
thereafter
a
request
for
sanctions.
almost
immediately
after
the
request
for
sanctions
was
filed,
mr.
chief
justice...
gets
to
the
point
about
who
made
the
allegations...
request
was
made
by
the
defendant
in
the
case
to
depose
one
of
the
principals,
the
leading
shareholder
and
the
president
of
the
client
company.
petitioner
opposed
the
deposition
at
that
time,
which
was
focused
only
on
rule
11,
because
the
district
court
hadn't
addressed
the
12(b)(6)
motion,
hadn't
considered
the
merits,
and
enormous
clients...
enormous
questions
of
attorney/client
privilege
and
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
privilege
questions
and
rule
11
issues
at
a
time
when
this
case
was
in
its
infancy
and
there
was
the
previously
filed
robinson-patman
claim
pending.
and
they
opposed
the
deposition
and
the
district
court
ordered
that
the
deposition
take
place.
and
it
did.
during
the
course
of
that
deposition,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
before
this
court,
this
court
can
see
that
counsel
essentially
instructed
its...
the
principal
of
its
client
not
to
answer
any
questions
with
respect
to
what
the
client
said
to
the
law
firm.
instead,
petitioner
offered
to
make
available
any
member
or
the
law
firm
to
explain
the
origins
of
the
complaint,
the
information
that
was
relied
upon,
anything
else,
without
waiving
the
attorney/client
privilege.
well,
if
i
might
jump
ahead
in
the
law
for
a
moment,
if
we
had
the
benefit
of
all
the
cases,
if
we
had...
had
had
in
1984...
in
1983
the
benefit
of
all
the
cases
decided
in
the
next
four
or
five
years,
one
could
say,
well,
didn't
they
know
that
procedures
would
be
developed
whereby
in
camera
you
could
go
before
the
district
court
and
make
certain
representations
that
wouldn't
be
disclosed,
that
there
wouldn't
be
a
waiver
of
privilege.
and
there
are
ways
to
deal
with
attorney/client
privilege
problems
that
might
have
enabled
the
deposition
to
take
place,
information
to
be
provided
to
the
judge,
without
waiver
of
the
privilege
and
the
answer
is
yes.
with
the
benefit
of
what
came
afterwards,
it
might
have
been
possible
to
do
things
differently.
but
this
was
early
1984.
it
was
early
in
rule
11.
and,
in
fact,
the
record
indicates
that
the
client
basically
said,
i
relied
on
the
law
firm
and
was
instructed
not
to
answer
any
questions
about
what
the
client
in
fact
told
the
law
firm.
the
petitioner
represented
to
the
district
court
and
represented
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
represents
to
this
court,
that
its
investigation
was
at
all
times
based
upon
the
information
and
belief
provided
by
this
experienced
client,
a
client
that
had
been
in
the
men's
clothing
business
for
14
years
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
complaint,
that
it
had
experience
in
the
industry
and
that
one
of
the
difficulties
with
this
record
was
the
difficulty
of
dealing
with
attorney/client
privilege
questions
and
an
early
sanctions
motion...
early
in
the
case...
before
the
merits
were
even
to
be
addressed.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
no,
sir.
the...
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether...
you
don't
have
before
you
the
question
of
the
amount
of
sanctions
or
whether
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion.
the
court
denied
review
of
both
those
questions.
it
did
grant
review
on
the
issue
of
what
the
standard
of
review
should
be,
whether
it
should
be
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
and,
to
some
extent,
the
propriety
of
imposing
sanctions
would,
of
course,
depend
on
the
scope
of
review
that
the
appellate
court
should
have
used.
if
the
court
decides
that
a
higher
standard
should
have
been
used
than
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
would,
under
the
question
granted,
be
justified
in
remanding
this
case
for
further
consideration
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
whether--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
that's
a
very
fair
conclusion.
without
criticizing
the
court
of
appeals
in
any
way,
i
think
the
fairest
statement
that
one
can
make
is
that
it's
very
difficult
to
tell
from
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
exactly
what
standard
it
used.
there
are
prior
opinions
of
the
district
of
columbia
court
of
appeals
which
would
bind
that
panel,
unless
the
court
were
to
go
on
en
banc
and
of
course
overrule
the
prior
decisions
which
suggest
that
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
was
used
in
the
circuit.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is...
that
is
the
first
question
granted
and
there
are,
however,
additional
questions
we
believe
that
fall
appropriately
within
the...
what
the
court
of
appeals
scope
of
review
is.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
justice
white,
you're
correct
and
i
suggest
that--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--immediately.
[laughter]
the
first
argument
that
the
petitioner
makes
to
this
court
is
that
rule
41(a)(1)(i),
which,
if
the
court
permits,
i'll
refer
as
rule
41
to
avoid
being
tongue-tied
and
each
time
meaning
that
particularly...
particular
subsection
of
the
rule.
we
submit
that
the
second
circuit
was
correct
when
it
said
that
when
a
voluntary
dismissal
is
filed
under
rule
41,
the
case
ends.
and
when
the
case
ends,
rule
11
sanctions
may
no
longer
be
imposed.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
in
our
view,
justice
o'connor,
yes.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
justice
o'connor,
to
give
a
full
answer
to
that,
i
want
to
be
clear.
our
position
is
that
with
respect
to
criminal
contempt,
18
u.s.c.
401,
as
well
as
28
u.s.c.
1927,
the
penalty
provision
for
lawyers
who
vexatiously
multiply
proceedings,
that
the
court's
power
to
impose
and
to
consider
contempt
and
penalties
on
the
lawyer
under
that
statute
are
not...
are
not
ended
when
a
rule
41(a)(i)
dismissal
is
filed.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
congress
has
provided
by
statute
for
very
particularized
sanctions
for
the
most
egregious
forms
of
behavior
and
that
prior
to
the
amendment
in
1983
of
rule
11
there
was
no
indication
that
contempt
or
other
sanctions
for
misbehavior,
particular
affront
to
the
court,
couldn't
be
considered.
what
we
have
today,
and
the
reason
this
case
we
submit
is
different
than
the
issues
presented
from
those
statutory
provisions,
particularly
contempt,
is
that
we
have
your
rules.
we
have
your
rule
11,
your
rule
41,
and
a
construction
of
those
rules
and
what
you
intended.
and
your
rules
provide
two
exceptions
to
rule
41...
41(a)(1).
they
provide
that
that
rule
will
be
subject
to
23(e),
the
class
action
rule
which
requires
the
judge
consider
notice
to
the
class
before
the
dismissal
becomes
final,
and
66,
the
receiver's
rule.
no
one
suggested
when...
in
1983
when
the
rule
was
amended,
that
there
ought
to
be
an
additional
exception
for
rule
11.
now,
this
is
also
different--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--well,
it's...
justice
o'connor,
i
would
like
to
argue
to
you
that
the
plain
language
of
rule
41
requires
the
reading
that
we
urge
upon
the
court,
but--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--but
we
cannot
do
that.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
but
part
of--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--the...
i
think
the
words
"without
prejudice"
are
important
in--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--well,
perhaps
i
can
add
to...
to
that.
in
this
case,
both
the
attorney
and
the
client
were
sanctioned.
and,
of
course,
rule
11
requires
that
the
court
consider
sanctions
both
upon
the
attorney
and
the
client,
or
both.
and
the
question
then
becomes
whether
or
not
a
dismissal,
as
you...
as
you
so
aptly
put
it...
which
rule
41(a)(1)
says
will
be
without
prejudice
can
be
in
some
instances
with
prejudice
because
the
court
will
use
that
as
the
sanction
it
chooses
for--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--rule
11
violations.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
let
me
perhaps
answer
that
in
two...
two
ways.
the
arguments
that
respondents
make
to
the
court...
now,
the
court,
of
course,
can
accept
less
of
this
argument...
the
arguments
that
respondents
make
is
that
indeed
rule
11
does
give
the
federal
district
court
the
power
to
dismiss
the
case
with
prejudice
as
a
sanction,
notwithstanding
rule
41
saying
dismissal
will
be
without
prejudice.
they
are...
and
they
are
in
effect
forced
to
that
position
because
all
of
the
cases
decided
in
the
lower
court
say
that
the
district
judge
has
essentially
a
whole
array
of
sanctions,
whatever
the
district
judge
deems
appropriate.
and
their
argument
is
that
that
is...
you
can
square
that
reading
of
rule
11
with
rule
41
by
simply
saying
that
the
with
prejudice
is
a
penalty
imposed
because
of
a
rule
11
violation
and
that
somehow
that
doesn't
interfere
with
rule
41's
guarantee
to
the
client
that
dismissal
would
be
without
prejudice.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
the
court
could
say
that,
justice
scalia,
and
it--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--it
would
be.
it
would
be,
in
fact,
in
our
judgment,
required
as
a
fair
construction
of
the
two
rules
at
a
minimum.
but
beyond
that,
and
this
goes
back
to
the
question
that
the
chief
justice
put
about
what
the
effect
would
be
of
a...
of
a
dismissal.
one
of
the
things
that
rule
11
does,
at
least
if
our
argument
is
accepted
and
the
law,
at
least
as
it's
developing
now,
is
that
there
are
at
least
minimum
procedural
requirements
that
must
be
employed
before
any
sanctions
are
imposed.
one
of
those
requirements
is,
at
least
in
some
instances
where
the
sanction
is
severe,
that
there
be
fact-finding
by
the
court.
and
those
facts
may
very
well
give
rise
to
collateral
estoppel
fact
unless
there
is
an
appeal
and
unless
the
appeal
is...
produces
a...
an
overturning
of
the
lower
court's
decision.
what
happens
on
rule
11
is
there
are
no
sanctions
in
the
abstract.
there
are
sanctions
because
the
district
judge
makes
a
decision
that
something
was
wrong.
and
if
the
district
judge
decides
that
something
was
wrong
has
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
case,
we
now
have
a
situation
in
which
41
says
you
can
dismiss
without
prejudice,
but
rule
11's
dismissal
may
in
fact
be,
as
a
practical
matter,
prejudicial
not
only
in
the
sense
of
economically
prejudicial
but
prejudicial
in
the
very
legal
sense
of
making
it
more
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
bring
a
subsequent
suite
based
on
those
same
facts.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
to
the
extent
that
the
difficult
but
not
impossible
involved
fact-finding
and
collateral
estoppel
that
might
make
the
second
action
if
not
wholly
barred...
i
mean,
it
may
make
the
second
action
precluded
at
least
in
part.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
i
think
that
it
is
a...
that
the
with
prejudice
language,
or
without
prejudice,
means
without
having
any
preclusive
effects
upon
a
subsequent
suit.
and
in
the
case
of
rule
11,
there
are
two
possibilities,
justice
scalia,
as
you
say.
one
is
the
court
could
say
that
you
simply
cannot
dismiss
with
prejudice
totally
so
that
the
complaint
therefore,
at
least
in
theory,
could
be
refiled.
but
the
other
problem
in
rule
11
sanctions
is,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
findings
which
may
have
preclusive
effect
either
because
they
are
imposed,
as
in
this
case,
directly
against
the
client
as
well
as
the
law
firm,
or
because
they're
imposed
against
the
law
firm
and
the
law
firm
and
client
are
in
privity.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
yes.
the...
if...
it's
true,
mr.
chief
justice.
our
argument
is
in...
that...
and
this
is
where
the
first
issue
and
second
issue
do
have
some
overlap...
is
that
one
of
the
functions
of
judicial
review
in
the
courts
of
appeal
is
to
assure
that
before
sanctions
are
imposed...
that
before
they
are
imposed
that
there
are
careful
fact-finding
supporting
the
imposition
of
sanctions
and
a
clear
statement
of
the
rule.
it's
the
fact-finding,
as
you
i
think
indicated
in
your
question,
that
has
the
possibility
of
preclusive
effects
and--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
justice
scalia--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--there
is...
there
is
nothing
that
is
inherent
in
any
case
that
says
a
judge
in
making
findings
would
necessarily
make
fact
findings
about
the
merits
of
an
issue
or
the
case.
but
in
some
cases
that
is
part
and
parcel
of
the
fact-finding
when
the
judge
looks
at
what
the
lawyer
did.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
well,
it
could
be
in
a
given
case,
justice
scalia.
if
in
fact
the
district
judge
says
that
in
filing
the
complaint
the
lawyer
alleged
facts
a,
b
and
c,
a,
b
and
c
are
untrue.
based
on
the
record
before
me,
those
facts
in
fact
may
be
necessary
to--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--justice
stevens,
that's
theoretically
possible,
that
the
judge
will
say
that
in
some
cases
that
a,
b
and
c
are
true,
the
lawyer
alleged
them
to
be
true,
but
the
lawyer
didn't
really
know
that
they
were
true,
and
could
impose
sanctions
for
that
reason.
in
other
cases,
the
judge
may
in
fact
say
they're
not
true.
now,--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--that's
possible.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
he
may
also
be
sanctioned...
and
this
is
a
problem
with
the
construction
of
rule
11
that
allows
sanctions
to
be
imposed
after
a
dismissal...
that
it
may
also
be
the
case
that
the
judge
will
say
facts
a,
b
and
c
are
untrue.
now,
justice
scalia
may
be
correct.
he
didn't
have
to
say
that.
and
we
could
make
an
argument
perhaps
down
the
line
in
some
court
that
a
judge
who
so
found
was
going
beyond
what
that
judge
had
to
do,
that
he
should
have
focused
simply
on
the
theoretical,
did
the
lawyer
investigate.
but
there's
no
guarantee
that
argument
in
fact
will
win
and
that
it
won't
be
a
preclusive
effect.
the
other
thing,
if
i
might
say,
about...
mrs.
o'connor,
back
to
the
question
you
asked...
about
the
court's
construction,
why
this
is
different
from
contempt,
is
that
if
the
court
decides
that
rule
11
sanctions
may
be
imposed
after
a
voluntary
dismissal,
the
court
essentially
is...
is
saying,
because
the
rule
allows
that
they
can
be
imposed
sua
sponte,
any
time
without
time
limits.
the
time
limits
this
court
has
provided
in
its
rules
for
various
things...
for
example,
to
reopen
a
judgment...
would
have
no
force
in
effect.
when
this
court
looked
at
the
attorney's
fees
question
when
an
application
for
attorney's
fees
under
statute
ought
to
be...
ought
to
have
to
be
filed,
the
court
struggled
with
whether
that
59(3)
time
limit,
the
10-day
time
limit
should
apply,
and
it
ended
up
saying
no
because
this
was
a
statutory
creature.
but
this
is
a
rule
creature
and
the...
it
is...
it
is
the
case
which...
that
if
the
court
decides
that
rule
11
sanctions
remain
available
forever,
that
no
time
limit
otherwise
provided
in
the
law
has
any
force
and
effect.
now,
that
might
sound
like
a
theoretical
problem,
except
this
case
demonstrates
how
real
it
is.
in
this
case,
almost
four
years
went
by
between
the
time
that
the
sanctions
motion
was
filed,
the
voluntary
dismissal
took
place.
and
suddenly,
at
the
conclusion
of
a
wholly
unrelated
case,
the
district
court
judge
said,
well,
the
time
is
now
right
to
consider
the
old
rule
11.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
i'm
not
sure,
justice
o'connor.
we
would
certainly
urge
that
it
was
unfortunate.
we
would
certainly
urge
that
there
is
a
real
appearance
problem
and
a
practical
problem
if
rule
11
sanctions
remain
available
in
any
case,
no
matter
when
it
ends,
for
any
judge
to
recreate
at
any
time.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
i
don't...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
know
of
a
time
limit
on
contempt
sanctions.
the...
there
are
other
procedural
protections,
and
criminal
contempt,
of
course,
being
the
criminal
sanctions,
has
the
speedy
trial
act
provisions
that
would...
that
would
apply.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
civil
contempt
is...
is,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
no...
i
don't
know
of
any
sanctions.
but
usually
it's
a
contempt
power
that's
invoked
during
a
case
to
produce
certain
forms
of
behavior,
and
when
the
case
is
over
rarely
invoked
thereafter.
i
can't
think
of
a
case
where
it's
invoked
after
the
end
of
the
case.
now,
if
i
might...
i
mean,
i
certainly
realize
that
it's...
it's
an
unpopular
position
to
stand
here
before
this
court
to
say
that
if
a
lawyer...
if
a
lawyer
were
to
file
a
plainly
inadequate
complaint
and
then
move
to
dismiss
the
complaint
under
rule
41,
that
somehow
the
lawyer
should
escape.
that
offends
almost
everyone's
basic
sense
of
what
seems
right,
at
least
at
the
outset.
but
there
is
no
rule
11
case...
there's
no
rule
11
case
that
doesn't
raise
this
question,
which
is
how
are
we
going
to
know
whether
or
not
there
was
an
inadequacy
unless
we
start
the
procedural
machine
rolling
to
make
the
rule
11
determinations?
and
our
submission
is
rule
41
has
always
served
a
very
valid
and
important
purpose.
it
allows
people
to
walk
away.
and
in
this
case,
to
walk
away
before
there's
any
expense.
in
this
case
if
there's
one
fact
that
i
hope
will
be
significant
to
this
court,
it
is
this
one.
that
before
this
complaint
was
filed...
before
this
complaint
was
filed,
after
the
clients
made
their
allegation
to
petitioner,
this
petitioner
gave
a
copy
of
the
complaint
to
the
general
counsel
for
hartmarx,
the
parent
company.
it
gave
a
copy
of
the
complaint
to
counsel
who
are
before
you
and
gave
then
all
the
time
they
wanted
to
examine
the
complaint
and
to
talk
about
it
before
it
was
filed.
and
these
lawyers
said,
go
ahead,
file
your
complaint.
the
complaint
was
filed.
no
one
suggested
that
the
facts...
and
in
this
case
it
was
only
one
set
of
facts
that
mattered,
namely,
there
was
price-fixing
going
on...
price-fixing
bolstered
by
an
exclusive
dealership.
rather
than
say,
hey,
you've
got
this
wrong,
we
can
help
you
with
it,
don't
file
it...
rather
than
that,
they
waited.
the
moment
the
complaint
was--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--justice
scalia--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--justice
scalia,
i'm
glad
you
put
the
question
that
way
because
i'd
like
to
give
you
as
direct
an
answer
as
that
question
is.
that
is
exactly
our
argument.
and
the...
i'd
say
this...
this
to
the
court
about
this
entire
case.
you
have
rule
41,
you've
got
rule
11,
and
you
have
the
lawyers
arguing
to
you
both
as
amicus
and
as
parties
in
this
case.
you've
got
them
arguing
that
what
we're
trying
to
do
is
to
deal
with
the
system
that
is
designed
to
provide
speedy,
fair
justice
for
all
the
parties.
now,
one
way
to
do
that
is
to
take
rule
11
and
to
say
what
rule
11
does
is
it
imposes
some
obligation
on
plaintiffs,
who
have
no
coercive
power
to
force
facts
from
defendants
at
all,
and
to
say
to
them,
you
take
your
chances.
and
to
defendants,
play
cat
and
mouse,
hold
back
the
facts,
run
and
use
rule
11
as
a
club.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
well,
in
this
case
i
would
like
to
remind
the
court,
justice
scalia,
there
has
been
no
determination
at
all
as
to
whether
the
facts
alleged
by
the
clients
of
petitioner
are
true.
we
never
reached
that
issue.
petitioner's
clients--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--i
don't
believe...
i
don't
think
that
that's
a
fair
characterization,
justice
rehnquist.
there
is
a
reference
to
a
washington
post
article,
suggestions
by
respondents
that
there
was
publicity
in
this
case.
but
i
think
a
fair
statement
of
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
the
petitioner,
before
it
filed
the
complaint,
was
trying
to
talk
about
it
and
use
the
litigation
when
it
was
apparent
that
there
was
going
to
be
no
discussion.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
the...
the...
it
was
a
follow-up
to
a
robinson-patman
act
complaint
which
was
filed
as
a
counterclaim,
probably
a
compulsory
counterclaim
under
the
rules.
and
it
was
an
attempt
to
say
to
the
defendants
in
that
case
that
we
think
we
have
a
bigger
antitrust
problem
here.
we're
going
to
file
a
separate
case.
we
think
we've
got
facts
unless
you
tell
us
otherwise.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
i
think
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
no
one
has
suggested
that
the...
that
a
filing
of
a
complaint
is
the
beginning
of
the
discussion.
in
this
case,
the
complaint
was
drafted
after
there
had
been
extensive
discovery
in
the...
with
respect
to
robinson-patman
that
led
to
the
belief
that
there
were
broader
antitrust
violations.
and
the
court
has
a
choice,
and
the
lower
courts
have
a
choice
when
they
get
into
the
standard
of
review.
and
the
choice
is
quite
clear.
the
choice
is
do
you
want
litigants
to
avoid
litigation
where
they
can?
do
you
want
them
to
share
information
short
of
having
to
invoke
the
compulsory
process,
or
do
you
want
them
to
run
into
court
and
make
rule
11
motions?
if
this
court
said
nothing
else
other
than,
the
lower
courts
ought
to
be
clear
that
there's
a
duty
to
mitigate.
but
you
can't
come
in
and
invoke
rule
11.
you
can't
do
it
if
you've
had
a
chance
to
avoid
all
the
damages
and
you
chose
not
to
take
that
chance.
there
would
be
no
better
principle
for
reducing
the
cost
of
litigation
and
making
it
a
more
civilized
place
in
which
to
try
cases.
there
are
lots
of
lawyers
out
there,
whether
they're
plaintiff's
employment
lawyers
who've
filed
an
amicus
brief...
lots
of
lawyers.
now,
if
they
can't
get
all
the
facts...
they
have
allegations,
they
do...
they
make
efforts
to
corroborate,
and
when
they
do,
they
have
to
decide
what
to
do
next.
and
what
to
do
next
may
be
to
run
into
court
and
take
your
chances
on
rule
11
or
to
say
to
the
defendants,
here's
what
we
think
we
have.
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
no
one
is
suggesting
that
the
defendant
should
be
obligated
to
go
through
every
line
of
a
complaint
and
to
review
it
for
all
the
law
and
all
the
little...
you
know,
intricacies.
but
where
it's
one
essential
fact
and
they're
saying,
we
think
this
is
what
we've
found
out...
if
they
think
there's
something
wrong,
they
ought
to
say
it.
in
the
court
of
appeals
they
said
they
had
an
800
number...
never
mentioned
in
the
district
court,
never
mentioned
it
in
this
court
in
any
of
the
papers...
which
they
said
that
the
plaintiffs
could
have
called
to
find
out
where
these
distributors
were.
well,
that
800
number
was
never
mentioned.
if
it's
easy
to
avoid
litigation,
this
court
ought
to
say
to
the
courts
of
appeals:
mitigation
is
an
important
part
of
rule
11.
some
of
the
lower
courts
have
said
that.
that,
we
submit,
is
at
the
heart
of
what
the
scope
of
appellate
review
here
ought
to
be.
i
have
almost
no
time
left,
but
i
hope
i
might
reserve
the
minute
or
so
that's
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
mr.
chief
justice:
we
believe
rule
38
of
the
appellate
rules
and
section
1912
of
28
u.s.c.
govern
the
recovery
of
fees,
including
attorney's
fees
on
appeal,
and
they
are
the
exclusive
rules.
nothing
the
advisory
committee
notes
on
rule
11
indicates
that
it
was
intended
to
be
a
fee-shifting
statute
or
rule
for
appeal.
with
respect
to
the
tripartite
analysis
that
we
urge
upon
you
in
terms
of
scope
of
review,
you're
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
likely
to
produce
more
appeals.
it's
likely
to
produce
more
careful
appellate
review,
it's
like
to
have
lawyers
coming
up
to
the
courts
of
appeals
more
often.
it's
what
this
case
is
about.
it
really
is
about
where
the
lawyer
is
hamstrung
with
questions
of
attorney/client
privilege
back
at
a
time
where
they
didn't
know
how
to
deal
with
that
question
and
put
forth
all
the
facts
before
the
district
court...
whether
they're
entitled
to
careful
findings,
the
most
careful
kinds
of
scrutiny
before
the
district
judge
rules,
and
whether
before
their
reputations
are
impugned
they're
entitled
to
careful
appellate
review.
we
submit
that
they
are.
thank
you.
