chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-275,
cooter
&
gell
v.
hartmarx
corporation.
mr.
saltzburg,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
it
clear
that
both
the
attorneys
and
the
client
here
brought
forth
these
allegations?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
take
it
it
is
the
record
you're
going
to
deal
with.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
don't
have
before
us,
do
we,
the
question
of
whether
it
was
appropriate
for
the
district
court
to
impose
sanctions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
moment
ago,
mr.
saltzburg,
i
asked
you
do
we
have
here
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
the
district
court
imposing
sanctions.
we
don't
have
the
question
of
the
propriety
of
imposing
on
those
facts,
but
we
do
have
the
question
of
the
authority,
really,
after
a
voluntary
dismissal,
don't
we?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
i
practiced
for
16
years
in
a
state
which
had
the
federal
rules,
as
well
in
the
federal
courts,
and
a
voluntary
dismissal
under
rule
41...
the
only
benefit
you
thought
you
got
from
it
was
that
it
wasn't
res
judicata.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--what
would
it...
a
sanction
that
made
it
more
difficult
but
not
impossible
to
bring
a
subsequent...
you
would
treat
that
as
a
dismissal
with
prejudice?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
do
you
interpret
the
phrase
41
to
mean
beyond
it
not
being
res
judicata?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
kind
of
around
robin
hood's
barn,
isn't
it?
if
there's
a
hearing
required
and
if
findings
have
to
be
made.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
a
time
limit
on
contempt
sanctions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
civil
contempt?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
didn't
your
client
try
to...
didn't
your
client
succeed
in
publicizing
the
filing
of
the
complaint
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
when
a
plaintiff
files
a
claim
for
$500,000
damages
as
a
result
of
an
accident
and
he
says
to
the
other
side,
i
think
we
have
a
tort
problem
here...
i
mean,
that
isn't
what
most
people
think
the
filing
of
a
complaint
is,
kind
of
a
starting
of
a
discussion.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
saltzburg.
mr.
favretto.
chief
justice
rehnquist
please
do
it,
mr.
favretto,
with
a
mind
to
the
three
questions
before
the
court,
will
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
one
were
to
compare
different
standards
of
review
and
if
you
were
to
say
clearly
erroneous
on
facts
and
de
novo
on
law,
as
opposed
to
just
abusive
discussion
generally,
certainly
the
abusive
discussion
standard
would
spawn
less
litigation
over
this
subject
than
this
trifurcated
type
of
thing,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what...
what
particular
language
is
it
of
rule
11
that
you
think
authorizes
the
automatic
imposition
of
attorney's
fees
on
appeal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so...
and
you
say
the
appeal
is
caused
by
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
one...
one
could
equally
well
argue
the
appeal
was
caused
by
the
imposition
of
sanctions,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
does
that
[inaudible]
this
court
to
allow
sanctions?
if
you're
going
to...
do
we
have
to--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--you
really
treat
it
as
a
fee-shifting
statute,--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--don't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
say
that.
it--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--you
know,
1988
says
the
prevailing
party--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--gets
attorney
fees.
but
rule
11
doesn't
say
the
prevailing
party
gets
attorney's
fees.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
favretto.
mr.
saltzburg,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
saltzburg.
the
case
is
submitted.
