justice
white
well,
that
may
be
so
but
you
win
if
the...
if
there
shouldn't
have
been
any
sanctions
at
all.
justice
white
and
that's
what
you're
going
to
argue,
i
take
it.
justice
white
--well,
that
sounds
like
there
would
be
just
some
historical
facts
at
issue.
who
did
what
and
what
did
they
do.
and
if...
if
there's
a
dispute
about
that,
why
shouldn't
it
be
reviewed
by
a
clearly
erroneous
standard?
justice
white
well,
what
about
the--
justice
white
--all
right.
what
if...
what
if
you
have
the
facts
before
you
and
the
question
is
was
there
a
violation?
justice
white
yes.
and
the...
the
district
court
has
made
a
decision
that
yes,
there
was
a
violation.
now,
what
should
the
court
of
appeals
ask?
justice
white
that
shouldn't
be
de
novo?
justice
white
has...
hade
any
other
courts
ever
held
that
the
rule
41
bars
sanctions
after
a
dismissal?
justice
white
one...
one--
justice
white
--misinformed,
badly
misinformed
federal
court?
[laughter]
justice
white
well,
i
know.
but...
but
wouldn't
you...
to
get...
to
get
attorney's
fees,
if
the
only
issue
were
rule
41,
it
seems
to
me
you'd
have
to
say
it
was
really
a
groundless,
frivolous
claim.
justice
white
well,
it's
the
sanctions...
it's
the
sanctions
for
someone--
justice
white
--and
i...
i--
justice
white
--why
should
the
other
side
be
sanctioned
for
pressing
this
rule
41
problem
that
they've
had
perfectly
good
authority
for
pressing?
justice
white
no.
justice
white
well,
that's...
you
are
just
talking
like...
like
just
because
you
win
you
get
your
fees.
justice
white
well,
what
are
we
sanctioning
for?
what's
this...
what's
the
basis
for
sanctioning
your...
your
opponent
for
pressing
the
rule
41
issue--
--on
appeal.
--on
appeal?
justice
white
yeah,
but
you're--
justice
white
--but
you're
going
to...
you
want...
you
want
your
fees,
including
fees
for
your
arguing
the
rule
41
issue.
justice
white
i
don't
blame
him.
