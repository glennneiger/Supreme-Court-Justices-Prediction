mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
believe
the
court
has
put
its
finger
on
some
of
the
issues
that
are
of
concern
and
importance
here
today.
but
in
light
of
mr.
saltzburg's
comments
about
significant
facts,
with
the
court's
indulgence,
i'd
just
like
to
review
a
few
of
the
items
that
he
made...
he
made
some
allusion
to.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
i...
i...
i
accept
and
i
agree
with
your
observation
that
the
propriety
of
the
award
below...
the
propriety
of
the
rule
11
decision
below
is
not
before
this
court.
indeed,
this
court
rejected
review
of
that
issue
on
question
4.
but
mr.
saltzburg
has
folded
these
issues
into
his...
the
standard
of
review
question
perhaps
before
this
court,
and
i'd
just
like
to
briefly
get...
get
at
the
point...
get
at
the
point
in
response.
these
arguments
about
presenting
us
with
a
copy
of
the
complaint
before
filing
the
complaint
were
presented
to
the
district
court,
were
debated
during
argument
and
were
referred
to
in
affidavits
filed
by
petitioner's
senior
partner
before
the
district
court.
the
district
court
concluded
that
they
never
asked
us
for
our
view
of
the
facts,
that
if
they
had
asked
us,
they
wouldn't
have
believed
us,
and
the
whole
approach
was
made
in
the
context
of
trying
to
leverage
a
settlement
of
the
existing
litigation
as
well
as
paying
them
more
money
for
these...
for
these
offenses.
we
submit
in
that
context
that
is
hardly...
hardly...
the
kind
of
practice
that
this
court
wants
to
encourage
by
endorsing
a
system
where
litigants
talk
to
one
another
before...
before
filing
a
case.
secondly,
the
idea
that
they
rely--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--upon
their
client--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--that's--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--mr.
justice
stevens,
that's
the
federal
trade
commission.
that's
not
a
litigant
who
is
already
in
litigation
with
you
with
a
major
counterclaim
against
you
after
you've
filed
a
claim
for
a
$100,000
breach
of
contract
who
is
coming
to
you
saying,
we're
not
going
to
pay
you
that
$100,000.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
oh,
absolutely
not.
absolutely
not.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
no,
i
was
just
clarifying
the--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--okay.
with
respect
to
relying
on
the...
relying
on
their
client,
i
would
just
direct
the
court's
attention
to
pages
34
and
35
of
the
joint
appendix
where
when
i
asked
the
client
about
the
key
allegation
in
the
complaint
and
asked
him
what
he
knew,
what
independent
basis
he
had
for
that
information,
mr.
cooter
interrupted
me
and
asked
his
client,
"did
you
know
anything
other
than
what
we
told
you?
"
the
answer:
"no".
mr.
cooter,
"he
trusts
us,
as
well
he
should.
"
"obviously
mr.
dashtara,
the
client,
didn't
make
the
investigation.
"
"we
did
and
now
it's
crystalline.
"
the
attempt
to
shift
the
blame
or
shift
some
of
the
blame
to
an
absent
client
before
this
court
and
also
before
the
court
of
appeals
is...
is
not...
does
not
square
with
the
record.
the
court
considered
that
question,
made
findings
in
the
district
court
on
it,
and
i
think
the
record
that
we
have
before
us
has
to
form
the
basis
for
this
court's...
for
this
court's
assessment
of
the
issues
before
it.
moving
to
the...
the
merits
of
the
issues
before
the
court,
we
believe
that
petitioner's
contention
essentially
amounts
to
an
argument
on
the
voluntary
dismissal
point
that
no
matter
how
egregious
the
conduct,
no
matter
how
much
burden
or
pain
that
the...
that
the
lawyer
imposes
on
the
system,
rule
41...
the
voluntary
dismissal
aspect
of
rule
41
is
an
absolutely
escape
hatch
from
rule
11
sanctions.
this
cannot
be
correct.
to
state
the
principle
is
to
refute
it.
the
rules
do
not
conflict.
nothing
in
the
wording
of
the
rules
makes
them
conflict
with
one
another
necessarily.
the
rules
serve
different
purposes,
as
justice
o'connor
observed,
and
rule
11
is
a
sanctioning
provision
which
protects
independent
court
interests
and
it
is
an
authority
which
the
district
courts
must
retain
beyond
their
authority
to
rule
on
the
merits
of
the
claim.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
well,
justice
o'connor,
let
me
just
respond
by
giving
you
a
little
background
about
what
happened
here
and
then
responding
to
your
question.
first,
there
was
a
series
of
litigation,
related
litigation
between
the
parties
here...
various
subsidiaries
and
the
petitioner's
client,
various
subsidiaries
of
my
client
and
the
petitioner's
client.
the
litigation
was
not
finally
resolved
until
july
of
1986.
the
advisory
committee
notes
expect
that...
suggest
that
rule
11
sanctions
should
be
imposed
at
the
end
of
the
litigation.
well,
the
litigation
didn't
end
until
july
of
'86.
within
two
or
three
months
thereafter,
mr.
cooter,
petitioner's
senior
counsel,
appeared
before
judge
gasch
in
another
completely
unrelated
case,
the
kuwait
airlines
v.
american
security
case
that's
referred
to
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
when
that
case
was
completed
in
the
district
court,
as
petitioner
has
noted,
judge
gasch
called
the
motion
up
for...
for
a
decision.
it
could
have
been
complete...
it's
completely
equally
plausible,
is
our
submission,
that
the...
we
could
speculate
that
judge
gasch
was
essentially
giving
the
petitioner
and
its
senior
partner
consideration
in
not
ruling
on
the
rule
11
motion
that
was
pending
before
him
in
our
litigation
while
mr.
cooter
was
before
him
in
a...
in
a
completely
separate
case.
now,
that's
equally
plausible
speculation,
i
say,
but
it's
speculation
and,
in
any
event,
it
doesn't
have
a
jurisdictional
foundation.
it
doesn't
stop
the
district
court
from...
from
finally
acting
when
it...
when
it
did
act.
but
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
rule
41
cannot
preempt
or
give
a...
a
lawyer
an
absolute
immunity
bath
for
anything
he
does
before
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint.
and...
and...
and
the
facts
of
this
case--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--that's
true.
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
well,
rule
11,
i
think,
is
the...
is
the
appropriate
vehicle
for
dealing
with
this
kind
of
issue
in
the
most
efficient
manner
rather
than
to
have
perhaps
a
separate
proceeding
that
would
call
these
questions
up
in
a...
in
a
completely
different
context.
i
think
rule
11
was
clearly
intended
to
allow
the
district
courts
to
deal
with
the
problem.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
it's
not
a...
it's...
i...
i--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--i
accept
your...
your
modification.
but
this
case
is
a
good
example
of
why
that
can't
be
the
rule.
the
violation
occurred
with
the
filing,
the
harm
attached,
the
publicity
attached.
and
we
invoked
a
rule.
we
filed
our
motions.
the
affidavits
were
filed.
everything
was
done.
indeed,
the
hearing
on
the
motion
occurred
even
before
the
voluntarily
dismissal
was
perfected
because
this
voluntary
dismissal
required
a
waiver
of
the
notice
to
the
punitive
class
members.
so,
the
only
unfairness
in
that
scenario
would
be
to
the
system
and
to...
and
to
the
victim
of
the...
of
the
misconduct
in
this
case.
on
the
standard
of
review,
we
believe
that
the
petitioners
got
what
they
asked
for
below.
they
got
a
fresh
look.
there
is
nothing
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
suggests
deference
to
the
district
court
on
the
question
of
liability,
rule
11
liability.
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
simply
looked
at
their
own
affidavits
and
said
those
affidavits
do
nothing
more
than
confirm
the
fact
of
a
rule
11
violation.
it
was
impossible
to
conclude,
in
the
words
of
the
court
of
appeals,
how
no
inquiry
could
be
sufficient
inquiry
or
reasonable
inquiry,
and
how
an
inquiry
with
respect
to
four
proximate
markets
could
support
an
allegation
with
respect
to
misconduct
nationwide
in
all
major
metropolitan
areas.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
explicitly
as
to
the
selection
of
the
sanction
and
the
amount
of
the
sanction,
i'm
not
certain
of
that,
justice
o'connor.
i
think
that...
that...
there's...
i
wouldn't
quarrel
with...
with
a...
with
a
reading
that
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
operating
under
the
circuit
standard
and
that
was
the
prevailing
standard
that
they
were--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--we...
we
are
beyond...
going
beyond
the
application
in
this
case
because
we
don't
think
it
would
make
a
difference
in
this
case.
but
we
believe
that
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
is
the
appropriate...
appropriate
standard
in
rule
11
cases.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
i
think--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--it
may
well
be
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law.
i
think
it's
the
kind
of...
the
kind
of
question
that
appellate
courts
customarily
deferred
to
the
district
court's
judgment
in
deciding--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--i
do
because
i...
i
think
the
preamble
to
that...
to
that
provision
in
the
rule
suggests
that
after
a
reasonable
inquiry...
after
a
reasonable
inquiry
that
it
is
based
upon
the
good
faith.
so
i
think
it
really
comes
back
to
what
was
done.
we're
not
talking
about
being
wrong.
rule
11
is
not
about
being
wrong.
rule
11
is
about
what
did
you
do
before
you
filed.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
if
there
is...
if
there
is...
if
there
are
historical
facts
at
issue,
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
may
be
appropriate
as
to
those
disputed
facts.
frankly,
i
believe
that
a
clearly
standard
is--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
in
a
factual
context.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
that's
the
application
of
the
facts
to
the
standard
or
the
standard
to
the
facts.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
i
think
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
if
there
was
a
clear--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--no.
no,
no,
justice
white,
it
should
not.
if
there
is
a
clear
error
in...
in...
in
assessing
any
relevant
fact
or
consideration,
or
there's
some
clear
error
of
judgment,
i
think
that's
reachable
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
well,
it's
hard
for
me
to...
i...
i...
i...
it's
not
clear
to
me--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--well,
i...
i...
i
think
the
two
are
very
close.
the
two
are
very
close.
i
think
the
traditional
standard
that
has
been...
that
has
been
applied
in
similar
situations
talks
in
terms
of
abuse
of
discretion
or
deferential.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
that's
right.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
that's
where
i
come
out,
justice
scalia.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
i
think
the
trial
judge
should
make
clear
his
basis
for
his
judgment.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
well...
but
if
that
amounts
to
findings,
then
there
should
be
findings.
i
think...
i...
i
think--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--i...
i
think
if
there...
again,
if
there
are--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--i...
i
would...
i
would...
i
would
think
that
a...
that
a
district
court
should
be...
should
be
required
to
state
the
reasons,
the
factual
basis,
whether
they
are
disputed
or
undisputed.
and
if
they
are
disputed,
perhaps
a
clearly
erroneous
standard
could
be
applied
on
review
to
his
judgment
about
where
the
facts
come
out.
but
i
think
if
a
court
of
appeals
saw
a
record
or
a
decision
that
didn't
allow
it
to
understand
what
the
basis
for
the
district
court's
judgment
was,
then
that
would
be
of
itself
an
abuse
of
discretion
and
it
would
send
the
case
back
for
a
clearer
statement
of
the
factual
underpinnings
of
the...
of
the
holding.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
no
question
about
that.
and
i
think
giving
appellants
two
full
bites
at
the
apple
in
the...
in
the
court
of
appeals
just
would
foster
additional
litigation
over
sanctions.
and
it...
it's...
oh,
and
abusive...
not
reviewing
under
an
abusive
discretion
standard
is
also
completely
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
1983
amendments.
as
i...
as
i
have
read
the
background
of
the...
of
the
amendments,
and
the
advisory
committee
notes,
the
whole
purpose
here
was
to
kind
of
invest
district
courts
with
stronger
sanctioning
authority
and
with
the
weapons
necessary,
if
you
will,
to
administer
the
practice
of
attorneys
before
those
courts.
and
to...
to
give
them
the
flexibility
necessary
to
deal
with
a
variety
of
factual
situations,
but
yet
applying
an...
a...
an
objective
standard
of
reasonableness
under
the
circumstances.
not
the
judges
own
feelings
about
the
frivolity
of
something,
but
an
objective
standard
that
would
allow
the
reviewing
courts
to
measure
the
exercise
of
the
district
court's
discretion.
the--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--oh,
yeah.
i'm
about...
i'm
about
to
move
on
to
that,
justice
scalia.
the
petitioner's
position
on
appellate
fees
is
simply
that
the
district
court
cannot...
cannot...
include
in
its
sanction
the
costs
of
successfully
defending
a
rule
11
award
on
appeal.
their
view,
more
elaborated,
is
that
this
represents
a
kind
of
punishment
for
taking
a
non-frivolous
appeal,
and
only
rule
38
of
the
appellate
rules
governs
conduct
on
appeal.
our
position
is
that
that
argument
misses
the
point.
this
is
not
a
matter
of
punishing
anyone
for
conduct
on
the
appeal.
this
is
simply
an
exercise
of
delineating
the
proper
scope
of
the
sanctions
attaching
to
misconduct
in
a
district
court.
the
violation
occurs
in
the
district
court,
but
the
injury
lingers
on.
injury
caused
by
the
district
court
misconduct
is
simply
not
limited
to
what
happens
to
an
adversary
in
the
district
court.
therefore,
the
sanction
should
not...
should
similarly
not
be
limited.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
the
court
of
appeals
sent
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
for...
for
an
award
of
reasonable
appellate
expenses,
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
as
a
necessary
component
of
the...
of
the
sanction
which
was
invoked
in
this
case,
which
was
a
fee
should
be
sanctioned.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
well--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--well,
the...
the...
the
inclusion
of
appellate
fees
in
the
sanction
award
in
our
view
turns
upon
the
invocation
by
the
district
court
of
the
fee-shifting
aspect
of
the
rule.
the
district
court
says:
i
want
to
deter
this
conduct.
among
my...
among
my
options
is
a
fee-shifting
option.
i
think
that's
the
most
appropriate
sanction
in
this
case.
i
will
invoke
that...
invoke
that
authority.
once
that
authority
gets
invoked,
then
we
believe
rule
11
should
be
treated
as...
as
other
fee-shifting
provisions
are
customarily
treated.
simply
provide...
fulfill
the
objective
of
the
fee-shifting...
o
the
fee-shifting
award,
make
the
adversary
whole
for
the
costs
imposed
by
the
misconduct.
but
here
they
can
take
the--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--he...
he
may
say
that.
indeed,
he
may
impose
a
sanction
that
doesn't
amount
to
your
reasonable
costs.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
under
the
rule--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--but
we
believe
that...
we
believe
that
judge
gasch
here
in
the
district
court
explicitly
invoked
the
fee-shifting...
the
fee-shifting
provisions
of
the
rule.
and
that
carries
with
it,
under
the
plain
meaning
of
the
rule,
the...
the
full
impact
of
the
misconduct
and
the
full
impact
of
that
misconduct
continues
beyond
the
district
court.
and
that's
why
we
believe
that
the...
that
the
appellate
fees
should
be
included...
a
reasonable
amount
of
appellate
fees.
now,
the
court
has
wide
discretion
on
remand
as
to
determine
what
is
reasonable
in...
in...
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
we
don't
feel...
we
don't
feel
he
has
that
discretion
at
this
point,
justice
scalia.
and,
certainly,
if
this
court
were
to
rule
that
the
desirable...
the
desirable
rule
in
such
cases
was
to
include...
to
make
adversaries
whole
once
the
fee-shifting
aspect
of
the
rule
was
invoked,
that...
that
would
be
rule
that
would
govern
future
cases.
and
district
courts
would
know,
when
they
invoking
fee-shifting,
that
it
was
going
completely
beyond.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
the
language
that
entitles...
entitles
the
adversary,
or
the
victim,
to
reasonable
expenses...
and
it's
including
attorney's
fees...
incurred
because
of
the
filing,
the
improper
filing.
incurred
because
of,
caused
by,
as
a
result
of...
that's
the
language.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
absolutely.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
well,
but...
but...
but
the
imposition
of
sanctions
is
a
mandatory...
is
mandatory
in
rule
11.
the
imposition...
that's...
that's
just...
the
imposition
of
sanctions
was
the
logical
consequence,
the
intended
consequence
of
the
motion
for
sanctions,
and
it
flows
from
the
court's
authority
to
discipline
the
lawyers.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
absolutely,
justice
white.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
let
me--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--no.
let
me
just...
the
way
we
look
at
it...
i'll
back
up
a
little
bit...
why
we
don't
believe
this
is
going
to
deter
meritorious
appeals.
first
of
all,
you're
dealing
with
a
class
of...
of
litigants,
lawyers,
who
aren't
going
to
be
easily
deterred.
they
are
probably
the
best-informed
group
as
to
making
assessments
about
what
the...
what
their
chances
are
on
appeal.
take
this
case
for
example.
when
it
went
to
the
court
of
appeals,
it
had
two
issues.
one
of
which,
the
rule
41
issue,
was
never
raised
in
the
district
court.
it
was
never...
never,
ever
raised
in
the
district
court.
and
the
circuit
stood
five
to
one,
six
to
one,
whatever
it
was,
against
them
on
that
issue.
the
second
issue
was--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--and
as
well
as
the--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--okay.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
we
don't...
we
think
it
would
have
been
equally
beneficial
for
society
as
a
whole
if
the
petitioner
here
had
assessed
his
chances
and
felt
that
his
chances
were...
were
a
long-shot
and
had
decided
not
to
appeal.
i
don't
know
why
this
court
would
want
to
encourage
appeals
from
rule
11
sanctions.
now,
the...
where
the
issues
that
were
accepted
by
this
court
on
review
were
all
issues
that
resulted
as
a
consequence
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--when...
one
court,
the
second
circuit.
one
out
of,
i
think,
ten--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--or
eleven.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
we...
we
don't
find
the
reasoning
persuasive.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
not
at
all.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
frivolity
of
the...
of
the
claim
or
the
merits
of
the
claim.
all
we're
saying
is
we're
being
swept
along.
we
didn't
want
to
be
here
in
the
first
place.
as
much
as
i--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--value
the...
value
the
experience
of
being
here,
my
client
didn't
want
to
be
here.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
if
the
sanction
is
sustained--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--if
the
sanction
is
sustained,
would--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--justice
stevens,
we...
we
just
want
to
come
out
the
same
place
we
came
out
when
we
went
in.
we
don't
want
to
win
anything.
we're
not
trying
to
make
money
on
the
deal.
my
client
doesn't...
didn't
want
to
get
involved
in
this
litigation.
it's
been
swept
along.
it's
like
a
snowball
rolling
down
a
hill.
before
it
hits
its
victim
with
its
full
impact,
it's
three
times
larger
than
it
was
when
it
started.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
we...
we
didn't--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--we
didn't...
no,
we
didn't
see...
i...
i...
i'm
not
familiar
whether
or
not...
what...
what
those
fees
amounted
to
or
whether
or
not...
well,
what
they
amounted
to.
i'm
not...
i
don't
recall.
but
we
didn't
seek
those,
in
any
event.
we
didn't
seek
those.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
oh,
absolutely.
absolutely.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
he...
he
just
felt
that
we
shouldn't
have
prepared
as
much
as
we
did
for
the
ultimate
class
action
proceedings.
we
thought...
we
thought
this
was
a
major
matter.
if
it
didn't
get
dismissed,
the
motion--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--the
motion...
well,
we
thought
we
were
going
to
prevail.
no,
we
thought
we
were
going
to
prevail
ultimately.
no
question
about
it.
you
know,
the
interesting
thing
about
that
about
that
is
they
say,
why
didn't
they
tell
us?
footnote
14
of
their
petitioner's...
of
the
petitioner's
brief
is
a
remarkable
defense
of
the
validity
of
their
complaint
to
this
day.
they
went
out
and
they
found
out,
after
we
filed
the
motion,
that,
well,
they
don't
have
one
retailer
in
every
area,
they've
got
a
couple.
and
this
guy
only
carries
this
size
and
this
guy
carries
that
size.
and
they
say
they've
still
got
the
same
case.
they
defend
it
to
this
very
day.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
the...
the
reasonable
amount
of
the
appellate
fees
incurred
because
of
this
original
filing
should
be
awarded
to
us
once
the--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--absolutely.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
absolutely.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
it's
a
sanction.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
right.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
it
doesn't
have
to
do
with
prevailing
or
not
prevailing.
it
has
to
do
with--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--absolutely.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
it's
a
sanction.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
don't
do
it
with
our
money.
that's
all
we're
saying.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
let
us
come
out
as
whole
as
we
were
when
we
went
in.
it
would
pervert
rule
11
if--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--absolutely
not.
absolutely
not.
the
sanction...
it
is
a
sanction,
i
would
agree.
that's
first
and
foremost.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
there's
no...
there's
no
basis
for
sanctioning
and
for
taking
that
appeal,
or
for
the
conduct
of
the
appeal.
the
sanction
here
is
a...
it's
simply
giving
effect
to
the
award...
to
the
sanction
imposed
in
the
district
court.
the
district
court
said
that
the--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--the
appropriate--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--my
client
wants
to
be
no
worse
off
as
a
consequence
of
this
misconduct--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--than...
than
he
was
when
the
frivolous
filing
was
made.
to...
to
not
allow
for
a
reasonable
award
of
attorney's
fees...
and
the
judge,
the
district
judge
can...
can
get
into
the
issues
of
where
and
when
and
how
it's
divided
and
cut,
and
all
of
that.
but
to
now
allow
a
reasonable
award
of
attorney's
fees
on
appeal
would
simply
undercut...
undercut...
the
deterrent
effect
of
the
sanction.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
that's
true.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
that's
true.
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
we...
we--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--it's
true
in
this
case
as
well.
it
would
be
true
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
--right.
mr.
richard
joseph
favretto
that's
correct.
now,
we...
we...
we
tried
to
contain
our
damage
at
every
stage
of
this
litigation.
thank
you.
