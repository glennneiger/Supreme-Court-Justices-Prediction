justice
stevens
what
justice
scalia
is
saying,
as
i
understand
it,
is
even
if
a,
b
and
c
are
true,
you
can
nevertheless
hold
the
lawyer...
sanction
the
lawyer
because
he
didn't
really
find
out
that
they
were
true
in
time.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
he
could
be
sanctioned
for
filing
a
meritorious
complaint
if
he
didn't
investigate
it
thoroughly
enough
to
begin
with.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask--
justice
stevens
--one
question
since
you've
raised
that
point?
isn't
it
customary
for
the
federal
trade
commission
before
they
file
a
complaint
to
give
the
respondents
a
copy
and
often
they
negotiate
a
settlement
which
they
file
the
same
day
as
the
complaint?
justice
stevens
that's
fairly
routine,
huh?
justice
stevens
not,
but
assume
they
thought
they
had
a
good
case.
is
there
anything
wrong
with
their
telling
you
about
it
in
advance?
justice
stevens
and
isn't
it
an
appropriate
subject
for
discussion
during
a
settlement
conference?
i
mean,
maybe
it
doesn't
help
them
any,
but
i
don't
know
how
it
helps
you
either.
that's
what
i--
justice
stevens
--like
the
chief
justice,
i'm
more
interested
in
the
issues
than
this
particular--
justice
stevens
well,
of
course,
we're
not
really
talking
about
immunity
baths.
contempt
and
bar
association
disciplines
still
remain,
don't
they?
justice
stevens
but,
of
course,
no
benefit
to
your
client.
but
at
least
there
are
sanctions
for
the--
justice
stevens
--i
don't
disagree
with
that.
i
just
question
your
use
of
immunity
bath.
justice
stevens
it's
nothing
like
an
immunity
bath.
justice
stevens
but
may
i
ask
this?
do
you
conceive
it
to
be
part
of
the
trial
judge's
duty
to
make
findings
of
fact
on
the
relevant
factual
issues?
justice
stevens
well,
that's
not
an
answer
to
my
question.
justice
stevens
see,
what
i'm
concerned
about
is
that...
as
i
read
your
brief,
that
your
abuse
of
discretion
standard
might
not
require
any
factual
findings.
it's
just
sort
of
a
general
statement
of
a
conclusion
about
the
overall
problem.
whereas
if
you
would
agree
that
the
judge
at
least
had
a
duty
to
make
some
specific
factual
findings
that
were
the
predicate
for
the
action,
then
i
don't
see
how
you
could
escape
the
fact
that
the
standard
of
review
of
those
facts
would
be
clearly
erroneous.
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
the
argument
for
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
is
an
argument
for
not
being
required
to
make
specific
factual
findings.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
our
client's
attorneys
fees
in...
in
opposing
the
rule
41
argument
should
be
paid
by
the
other
side?
justice
stevens
well,
why?
do
you
think
that
is
a--
justice
stevens
--was
that
a
frivolous
issue?
justice
stevens
suppose
that
this
is...
suppose
the
only
issue
that
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
the
41?
justice
stevens
no.
justice
stevens
no,
no.
just
rule...
all
these...
they
said--
justice
stevens
--they
said
sanctions
shouldn't
have
been
imposed
at
all
because
of
rule
41.
that's
the
only
issue
it
took
up.
what
about
then?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
suppose
there
are
three
issues--
justice
stevens
--yeah,
but
supposing
there's
three
issues
on
appeal
and
you
win
on
two
and
lose
on
one,
you
still
get
all
your
fees?
i
think
you
do
under
your
argument.
justice
stevens
sure.
justice
stevens
but
they
say
you...
you
charged
too
much
for
your
time
or
you
put
in
your
time
from
the
time
they
showed
you
the
complaint
to
the
time
they
filed,
or
something
like
that,
which
shouldn't
have
been
done.
so
we
cut
that
out.
but
then
you'd
compensate
for
it
by
getting
a
little
more
for
having
been
required
to
defend
an
appeal.
you'd
end
up
a
net
winner.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
in
that
regard,
are
you...
you
entitled
to
compensation
for
your
attorney's
fees
for
time
spent
between
the
time
they
showed
you
the
complaint
and
the
time
they
filed
it?
justice
stevens
i
suppose
you
went
right
to
work
on
the
case
as
soon
as--
justice
stevens
--so,
what
you...
any
work
you
did
on
the
complaint
before
it
was
filed
was...
was
gratis
as
far
as
the
plaintiff
is
concerned?
justice
stevens
why...
why
did
the
district
judge
cut
your
fees
as
badly
as
he
did?
justice
stevens
it's
a
major
frivolous
matter.
[laughter]
