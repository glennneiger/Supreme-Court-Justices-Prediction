chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-542,
rudy
perpich
v.
department
of
defense.
mr.
tunheim?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
it
is
your
position,
i
suppose,
that
the
part
of
section
16
that
it
violates
is
that
that
says
it
is
reserving
to
the
states
the
authority
of
training
the
militia
according
to
the
discipline
prescribed
by
congress?
chief
justice
rehnquist
don't
you
think
the...
it
seems
to
me
a
less
extreme
application
of
the
militia
clause
of
the
constitution
to
say
that
it
reserves
to
the
states
the
right
to
draft
able-bodied
people
and
call
them
the
state
guard,
if
you
will,
than
the
contention
that
you're
construing...
the
construction
you're
contending
for
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i
mean
supposing
the
governor
wants
to
have
a
militia
there
in
minnesota
to
put
down
disturbances
365
days
a
year.
is
there
any
provision
of
existing
law
that
would
prevent
him,
or
the
minnesota
legislature,
from
passing
an
act
creating
a
state
guard,
drafting
people
into
it
and
making
them
available?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
some
provision
in
the
law
that
would
prevent
the
state
of
minnesota
from
setting
out
to
train
those
people?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
if
the
states
were
to
draw
on
this
unorganized
militia?
would
that
violate
the
federal
law,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
they
can't
be
paid
by
the
federal
government?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
what's
wrong
with
the
state
of
minnesota
paying
them
if
they
want
to
have
them
serve
the
purposes
of
the
state
of
minnesota?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but...
but
they
don't
exist,
i...
i
suggest
to
you
because
the
states
haven't
chosen
to
call
them
into
existence.
what...
mr.
tunheim,
what
do
you
make
of
footnote
5
in
the
solicitor
general's
plea
where
he
says
24
states
have
statutes
providing
for
a
state
defense
force
or
a
state
guard
that
is
separate
from
the
national
guard,
listing
minnesota
law
appears
to
recognize
a
state
guard
in
addition
to
the
national
guard,
citing
the
statute?
i
think
these
later
questions
have
all
been
directed
toward
this
kind
of
thing,
and
you
keep
turning
around
to
speaking
of
militia.
what
do
you
make
of
footnote
5?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
the
militia
clause
speak
of...
of
emergency?
i
mean,
section
16
which
you
say
has
been
violated,
the
authority
of
training
militia
going
to
discipline,
does
it...
is
it
qualified
in
any
way
by
the
existence
of
an
emergency?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
in
the
selective
draft
law
cases
the
court
said
that
the
power
of
congress
to
raise
armies
could
narrow
the
effect
of
a
militia
clause.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
did,
but
the
language
doesn't
say
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
tunheim.
general
starr.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what...
what
provision
of
the
constitution
is
it
that
you
rely
on
to
say
that
a
state
may
not
have
its
own
militia
that
it
arms?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
provision
is
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
that
are
kind
of
lurking
on
the
edge
of
this
case--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--that
we
really
don't
have
to
decide
in
writing
an
opinion
one
way
or
the
other.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
that's
not
a
question,
general
starr.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
tunheim,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tunheim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
