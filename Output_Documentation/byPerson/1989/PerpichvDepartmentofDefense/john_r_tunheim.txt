mr.
john
r.
tunheim
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
constitutionality
of
the
montgomery
amendment
which
removes
from
states
the
power
to
withhold
consent
to
foreign
training
of
the
national
guard
because
of
objections
to
location,
purpose,
type
and
schedule
of
that
training.
it's
codified
at
title
10,
section
672(f)
and
was
enacted
in
november
1986.
the
montgomery
amendment
effectively
nullifies
clause
16,
and
before
i
begin,
let
me
just
reference
the
three
most
relevant
constitutional
provisions,
because
they
are
referenced
a
lot
in
my
argument.
article
i,
section
8,
clause
12
gives
congress
the
power
to
raise
and
support
armies,
clause
15
gives
congress
the
power
to
provide
for
calling
forth
the
militia
to
execute
the
laws
of
the
union,
to
suppress
insurrections,
and
to
repel
invasions,
and
clause
16
gives
congress
the
power
to
provide
for
organizing,
arming
and
disciplining
the
militia
and
for
governing
such
part
of
them
as
may
be
employed
in
the
service
of
the
united
states,
but
reserving
to
the
states
respectively
the
appointment
of
the
officers
and
the
authority
of
training
the
militia
according
to
the
discipline
prescribed
by
congress.
now,
the
montgomery
amendment
effectively
nullifies
clause
16
by
removing
states'
powers
to
consent.
it
permits
unlimited
federal
authority
over
training,
and
leaves
no
control
or
authority
to
the
states.
the
montgomery
amendment
is
unconstitutional
because
it
violates
the
plain
language
and
meaning
of
clause
16.
it
overturns
long
settled
understandings
of
the
relationship
among
the
clauses
of
article
i,
section
8,
and
it
upsets
a
carefully
established
framework
eliminating
a
fundamental
part
of
the
checks
and
balances
as
established
by
the
framers.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
even
more
extreme
than
the
montgomery
amendment
is--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--yes.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states
is
essentially
the
same
thing
as
the
national
guard
of
the
states.
under
the
dual
enlistment
concept,
yes--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
it
does
apply
to
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states,
but
are--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--it's
part
of
the
two-week
training
program,
but
they
were
federalized,
justice
o'connor,
as
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states
in
the
reserve
component
part
of
dual
enlistment.
but
our
argument
in
the
case,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
simply
by
creating
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states
you
can't
simply
remove
from
the
national
guard
the
essential
state
organization,
the
constitutional
limitations
that
are
in
article
i,
section
8.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
yes,
that's
correct.
what's
more
extreme...
yes?
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
no,
it's
not
unconstitutional
to
take
the
militia
and
organize
it,
which
is
what
clause
16
gives
congress
the
power
to
do.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
justice
kennedy,
i
wouldn't
agree
that
we
would
have
to
say
that.
the
unorganized
militia
is
really
nothing.
it
is
a
body,
a
pool
of
individuals
who
are
able-bodied
and
able
to
perform
military
service
if
either
drafted
into
a
federal
army,
or
if
called
into
an
organized
militia.
it's
the
organized
militia
that
can
be
called
into
the
federal
service,
and
that
is
the
national
guard.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
well,
the
unorganized
militia
by
statute
exists
everywhere,
in
states
and
under
federal
law,
but
it
really
is...
is
nothing.
it's
just
a
pool
of
eligible
individuals,
and
that's
all
it
is.
it
doesn't,
it's
not
armed,
it's
not
trained,
and
it's
not
part
of
the
fighting
force
at
all.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
well,
justice
scalia,
currently
under
federal
law
there's
no
authority
for
a
state
to
keep
an
organized
militia,
other
than
the
national
guard,
and
the
national
guard
must
be
federally
recognized,
so
there
really
is
not
an
alternative
for
states.
it's
a
choice
between
accepting
the
federal
funding
and
participating
as
the
national
guard
or
not
having
an
organized
militia.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
the
national
guard
is
the
organized
militia.
it
is--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--federal
law
currently
does
not
permit
states
to
maintain
an
organized
militia,
other
than
the
federally
recognized
national
guard.
that's
the
requirement
of
federal
law
at
this
time.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
unorganized...
the
unorganized
militia
is
defined
under
federal
law,
and
i
think
the
laws
of
most
states.
it's
simply
defined
as
every
able-bodied
person
between
the
ages
of
18
and
45.
it's
a
pool
of
individuals
that's
available
for
military
service
at
some
point
in
time,
but
they
are
not
trained.
they
are
not
part
of
an
organized
militia
in
any
sense.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
there's
a
provision
of
federal
law
that
says
that
states
may
not
maintain
an
organized
militia,
other
than
the
national
guard.
it's...
the
national
guard
is
the
organized
militia.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
i
think
it
would,
because
that
would
be
organizing
the
unorganized
militia,
and
federal
law
says
that
you
cannot
keep
an
organized
militia,
other
than
the
national
guard.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
there...
there
is
a
federal
definition
in
federal
law.
the
organized
militia
means
the
national
guard.
it
is
defined
as
the
national
guard.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
but
there's
another
provision
of
federal
law
that
says
you
cannot
keep
an
organized
militia
other
than
the
national
guard,
justice
scalia,
or
something
called
state
defense
forces,
which
are
not
militia,
they're
not
defined
as
militia,
they
can't
be
called
forth
into
the
federal
service,
they
can't
be
paid,
and
they
simply
are
not
an
organized
militia
under
the--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
because
the
militia
under
the
constitution
can
be
called
forth
into
the
federal
service.
that's
an
essential
element
of
the
definition
of
"militia"
in
the
constitution
as
understood
by
the
framers.
and
the
defense
forces
by
federal
law
cannot
be
called
forth
into
the
federal
service.
they
can
be
used
only
within
the
borders
of
the
states,
and
as
a
practical
matter
they...
they
simply
don't
exist.
they
were
created
to...
to...
to
help
within
states
during
world
war
ii
when
national
guard
members
were
in
the
federal
service
for
the
duration
of
the
war.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
well,
certainly
there
exists
statutory
authority
in
each
of
these
states
for
creation
of
something
called
a
defense
force,
but
it's
carefully
not
described
as
an
organized
militia
in
any
sense--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--the...
the
provisions
in
minnesota
law
allow
for
creation
of
this
home
defense
force,
and
it...
it
was
used
during
world
war
ii.
it's
not
currently
used
at
all,
even
though
the
provisions
remain
on
the
books.
but
again,
the
defense
forces
are
carefully
referred
to
as
not
militia
because
that...
that
constitutes
a
different
definition
within
the
constitution.
it
calls
into
play
the
requirements
of
the
constitution,
and...
and
it
really...
they
have
carefully
not
identified
the
defense
forces
as
organized
militia
because
of
that.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
justice
scalia,
it
is
federal
law
that
doesn't
define
these
home
defense
forces
as
organized
militia.
federal
law
identifies
"organized",
right.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
it
was,
but
it
wasn't
militia
in
the
sense--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--it...
it
was
organized
by
the
state,
but
it
wasn't
militia
in
the
sense
given
to
it
by
the
constitution
which
allows
the
militia
of
the
states
to
be
called
into
the
federal
service,
and
this
is
where
the
national
guard
has
come
from.
the
national
guard
was
organized
out
of
the
state
militia,
and
our
argument
is
that
you
simply
cannot
take
the
constitutional
limitations
that
come
along
with
the
national
guard
and
take
them
away
simply
by
calling
them
a
different
name.
that's
the
essence
of--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--we
are
not,
justice
kennedy.
the
dual
enlistment
system,
properly
interpreted,
is...
is
a...
is
useful
and,
i
think,
constitutional.
what
we
are
challenging
is
the
use
of
dual
enlistment
to
avoid
the
militia
clause
limitations.
the...
when
dual
enlistments
were
created--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
lies
in
the
purpose
of
the
dual
enlistment
system,
justice
kennedy.
it
was
created
in
1933
for...
for
one
particular
reason,
and
that
was
so
that
the...
that
national
guard
units
as
trained
units
could
be
federalized
quickly
in
case
of
an
emergency
or
wartime
situation.
the
problem
in
world
war
i
was
that...
that
the
national
guard
units
were
disbanded.
the
individuals
were
drafted
as
individuals,
and
then
once
they
were
in
the
federal
army
the
federal
government
tried
then
to
recreate
these...
these
organized
units.
that
was
the
purpose
of
dual
enlistment,
to
provide
for
a
quick
mobilization
of
organized
units.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
training;
and
also,
it
was
expressly
limited
to
use
during
a
national
emergency
or
wartime.
congress,
in
1933
when
dual
enlistment
was
created,
in
no
way
intended
to
divest
from
states
the
training
authority
over
the
national
guard,
and
congress
didn't
understand
in
1933
that
it
was
divesting
such
training
authority.
there
wasn't
federal
training
of
the
national
guard
that
went
on
at
that
time.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
yes.
they
were...
they
were
federalized
for
purposes
of
section
672,
which
is
the
training
procedures,
the
training
section
for
two-week
purposes.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
justice
o'connor,
i
think
the
term
"discipline"
clearly
means
the
standards
to
be
applied
to
training.
the
framers,
in
fact,
feared
this
very
problem
of
confusing
the
authority
of
discipline
and
the
authority
of
training.
one
of
the
delegates
proposed
that...
that
the
training
reservation
to
the
states
simply
be
eliminated
because,
of
course,
the
states
would
have
that
authority
because
it
wasn't
being
expressly
given
to
the
new
federal
government,
and
the
delegate
was
talked
out
of
it
because
of
the
fear
that
discipline
might
someday
be
read
and
interpreted
broadly
enough
to
include
training.
the
framers
were
very
concerned
about
maintaining
an
effective
state
control
over
the
militia
except
during
times
of
emergency,
and
the
reservation
of
training
clause
really
has
to
be
viewed
in
that
light
along
with
the
appointment
of
officers
clause.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
not
in
clause
16,
mr.
chief
justice.
clause
15
sets
forth
three
purposes
for
which
the
militia
can
be
called
into
the
federal
service.
those
are,
in
essence,
emergency
situations,
and
the
state's
argument
is
also
that
congress
has
the
power
under
the
army
clause
during
an
emergency
to
call
the...
to
federalize
the
militia,
to
call
the
national
guard
into
the
federal
service
based
on
this
court's
decision
in
the
selective
draft
law
cases.
now
let
me
just
explain
in
a
nutshell
the
state's
position.
as
i
said,
when...
when
the
nation
faces
a
national
emergency,
it
is
our
view
that
congress
has
complete
power
to
federalize
the
national
guard
under
the
army
clause,
or
congress
can
utilize
the
three
purposes
in
clause
15
for
calling
the
national
guard
into
the
federal
service.
in
either
case,
state
authority
is
completely
removed;
but,
absent
those
circumstances,
states
retain
basic
control
over
the
national
guard,
particularly
with
respect
to
training
which
is
expressly
reserved
to
states.
this
position
harmonizes
the
army
clause
with
the
militia
clauses
instead
of
reading
out
of
existence
the
militia
clauses,
which
is
the
ultimate
effect
of
respondents'
position.
the
national
guard
is
really
a
quintessential
state
organization.
the
state
militias,
which
every
state
had
and
has
had
since
the
beginning,
were
organized
into
the
national
guard
pursuant
to
congress'
power
to
organize
the
militia.
they
have
remained
state
organizations
of
vast
importance
to
the
states
throughout
the
years.
the
national
guard
is
relied
on
very
heavily--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--the
state...
unorganized--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--justice
scalia,
if
the
governor
wanted
to
do
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
maintain
under
federal
law
any
other
organized
militia
other
than
these
defense
forces.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
they
would
not
participate
at
all
in...
in
the
federal
system?
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
that's
true;
but,
of
course,
federal
law
would
not
allow
any
organized
militia.
you
say
an
unorganized
militia--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--okay.
well,
the
unorganized
militia
really
is
nothing.
it's
not
organized
at
all.
it's
just
a
group
of
citizens.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
i
don't
think
that's
the
issue,
justice
scalia.
the
issue
is
that
the
states
were
reserved
the
authority
of
training
the
national
guard,
and
that
authority
is
now
being
taken
away
in
the
montgomery
amendment.
it's
express
language
in
the
constitution
in
clause
16
that
training
authority
is
reserved
to
the
states
and
just
by--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--for...
for
the
organized
militia,
right.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
during
an
emergency
or
wartime
situation.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
well,
i
think...
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
reviewing
the
selective
draft
law
cases
you
really
can't
separate
that
case
from
the
context
in
which
it
was
written.
the
issue
in
that
case
was
whether
the
militia
clauses
somehow
immunized
an
ordinary
citizen
from
mandatory
conscription
during
a
world
war
and,
of
course,
the
answer
to
that
was
no.
congress
would
not
have
any
power
to
raise
an
army
without
conscription
other
than
by
volunteers.
that
case
did
not
involve
the
national
guard.
it
did
not
involve
the
organized
militia.
it
did
not
involve
the
states
or
the
states'
reserved
power
under
clause
16.
it
did
not
involve
training,
either
peacetime
or
wartime.
in
fact,
the
solicitor
general
in
arguing
that
the
selective
draft
law
was
constitutional
assured
the
court
that
had
had
no
impact
on
peacetime
training
of
the
national
guard
which
was
reserved
to
the
states.
and
that
really
in
that
case
if
you
look
at
it
properly,
there
was
no
conflict
between
the
clauses
because
the
militia
clauses
do
not
give
rights
to
individuals.
they
give
rights
to
congress
and
to
the
states
in
this
balance
of
power
that...
that
the
framers
created.
to
the
extent
that
i
think
selective
draft
law
cases
is
relevant
here,
they
recognize
that
congress
has
very
strong
powers
during
wartime
and
during
emergency
situations.
congress
understood
that
in
1933
when
it
codified
this
emergency
power
into...
in...
and
created
the
dual
enlistment
system.
the
court
also
warned
in
the
selective
draft
law
cases
against
an
interpretation
that
would
effectively
destroy
the
militia
clauses.
i
think
that
case
has
to
be
limited
to
the
context
in
emergency,
and
that's
completely
consistent
with
the
states'
position
in
this
case
that
congress
does
have
the
army...
army
clause
power
during
an
emergency
to
federalize
the
national
guard.
let
me
talk
just
briefly
about...
about
the
framers
and
what
they
intended
here.
to
the
framers
the
militia
were
really
the
citizen
soldiers
belonging
to
the
various
states,
an
issue
of...
of
extreme
controversy
and...
and
substantial
debate
in
the
summer
of
1787
was
how
much
control
to
take
away
of
the
militia,
to
take
away
from
the
states
and
give
to
the
new
federal
government.
many
wanted
to
retain
plenary
state
control
over
the
militia
because
they
greatly
feared,
the
framers
greatly
feared,
the
effect
of
a
large
standing
federal
army,
and
they
believed
that
state
control
would
be
a
very
important...
a
very
important
check
on
misuse
of
the
federal...
federal
army.
they
rejected
alexander
hamilton's
proposal
to
make
the
militia
totally
subject
to
the
federal
government.
they
were
also
concerned,
however,
with
providing
the
federal
government
enough
authority
during
an
emergency
situation
to
be
able
to
have
access
to
the
militia,
and
so
they
reached
a
compromise.
the
militia
would
remain
a
state
organization,
but
in
an
emergency
for
limited
purposes
congress
would
have
power
to
call
the
militia
into
the
federal
service.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
if
that
were
the
purpose
of
the
call,
to
call
forth
into
the
federal
service
to
execute
the
laws
of
the
united
states,
yes.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
absolutely
none
if
there's
a
call
pursuant
to
clause
15.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
this
was
clearly--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
this
clearly
was
a
call
for
training
purposes,
or
federalization
for
training
purposes,
and
nothing
more.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
the
constitution,
justice
kennedy,
gives
to
states
the
power
to
train,
the
authority
over
training
the...
the
militia.
congress
can
prescribe
the
discipline
so
that
the
militias,
the
national
guards
of
the
various
states
can
work
together
and
can
fire
the
same
weapons,
can
read
out
of
the
same
drill
manuals,
can
drive
the
same
tanks
or
bulldozers.
that's
congress'
power
to
specify
the
discipline.
but
the
power,
the...
the
authority
over
the
training,
which
is
the
precise
words
in
the
constitution,
is
reserved
to
the
states.
the
framers
thought
it
was
so
imperative
to
reserve
this
power
to
the
states
that
they
wrote
it
into
the
constitution.
a
document
that
writes
in
very
little
express
reserved
powers
for
states
because
it's
a
document
that
gives
limited
powers
to
a
new
federal
government,
it
was
so
imperative
for
maintaining
this
control,
this
balance
of
power,
the
checks
and
balances
which
are
inherent
in
the
constitution
that
they
wrote
it
in,
and
it
is
the
language
of
the
constitution.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
the
discipline,
justice
white--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--means
the
standards.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
what
they're
supposed
to
teach
them.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
the...
the...
originally
it
was
a
drill
manual.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
that's...
that's
precisely
correct.
the
states,
though,
have
the
authority
over
the
training.
i
think
that
that--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--well,
if
you
read
discipline--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--i...
i
don't
think
that's
right,
justice
white.
if
you
read
the
term
discipline
that
broadly,
it
encompasses
a
good
part
of
what's
involved
in
the
authority
of
training.
there's
not...
it's
difficult
to
find
a
bright
line
in
here
between
discipline
and
training,
but
i
think
it
is
that
the
discipline
is
the
generalized
commands
that
are
given
by
congress
to
the
states,
and
the
particularized
application
of
those
general
commands
are
what
training
is
and
what
is
reserved
for
the
authority
of
the
states.
i
will
reserve
my
remaining
time
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
essence
in
this
case
is
really
a
dispute
over
what
dual
enlistment
means.
and
i
remind
the
court
that
these
two
entities
are
the
same
organization.
these
are
the
same
people.
dual
enlistment
merely
created
a
reserve
force
which
relies
completely
on
the
states,
on
the
national
guard,
that
the
state
organize
militias
for
its
members.
the
respondent
tries
to
claim,
somehow,
that
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states
and
the
national
guard
are
kind
of
like
apples
and
oranges;
you
can
switch
the
hats.
they
really
aren't
even
apples
and
apples.
they
are
the
same
apple.
these
are
the
same
people,
and
you
just
cannot
wave
this
magic
wand
and
eliminate
constitutional
protections,
constitutional
limitations,
which
were
the
essence
of
a
compromise
that
the
framers
made
200
years
ago
over
the
control
over
the...
of
the
militia.
the--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--i
think
the
term
militia
in
the
constitution
refers
to
the
militia
organizations
that
the
states
had
at
the
time
that
the
framers
sat
down
to
write
the
constitution.
it
has
been
used
in
the
sense
of
every
able-bodied
person
who's
available,
but
once
it
is
organized,
it
is
organized
as
a
militia.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
and
congress
has
exercised
that
power,
has
organized
the
militia,
and
has
created
the
national
guard.
that
is
the
entity
that
we're
talking
about
today.
now
they've
gone
beyond
that
to
interpret
dual
enlistment,
which
has
never
been
interpreted
to...
to
eliminate
constitutional
protections
to...
to
now
require
that...
that
to
be
done
under
the
army
clause.
in
1933,
when
dual
enlistment
was
created,
its
use
as
a
federal
force,
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states
was
expressly
limited
to
emergencies,
relying
on
the
selective
draft
law
cases.
when
that
was
changed
to
bring
the
national
guard
into
federal
training
for
the
first
time
in
1952,
it
was
done
only
pursuant
to
the
governors'
consent.
state
authority
over
training
has
been
consistently
recognized
for
200
years,
until
the
enactment
of
the
montgomery
amendment.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
