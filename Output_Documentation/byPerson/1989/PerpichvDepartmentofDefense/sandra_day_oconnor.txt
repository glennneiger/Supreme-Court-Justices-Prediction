justice

mr.
tunheim?
justice
o'connor
the
montgomery
amendment
appears,
at
least
on
its
face,
to
apply
only
to
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states,
not
the
state
militia
component.
justice
o'connor
well,
of
course,
that's
the
question,
whether,
whether
they
operate
as
one
and
the
same
or
differently
somehow,
at
least
on
its
face
the
amendment
appears
to
apply
to
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states.
justice
o'connor
now,
would
you
tell
me
whether
the
president,
in
this
case,
ordered
the
guard
units
to
honduras
for
training,
or
did
the
president
order
the
national
reserve
component
to
honduras?
did
he
federalize
them
and
send
them
that
way,
or
was
this
part
of
the
two-week
training
program
of
the
state
militia?
justice
o'connor
but
at
least
the
president
attempted
to
articulate
the
position
that
they
were
being
federalized
and
sent
there
in
their
capacity
as
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
tunheim,
in
this
particular
case
were
the
troops
federalized
and
ordered
to
honduras
for
training?
justice
o'connor
is
it
possible
that
the
term
"discipline"
in
the
militia
training
clause
includes
the
concept
of
location
of
the
training?
justice
o'connor
but
your
position
is
that
this
call
was
under
the
training
provision--
justice
o'connor
--not...
not
under
any
of
the
three
purposes
in
clause
15?
justice
o'connor
well,
general
starr,
in
the
statutes
when
congress
created
this
national
guard
of
the
united
states,
as
i
understand
it
the
statutes
did
provide
that
the
secretary
of
defense
could
order
any
national
guard
unit
into
active
duty
for
not
more
than
15
days
a
year
with
the
consent
of
the
governor.
now
i
guess
it's
your
position
that
that
provision
wasn't
necessary.
justice
o'connor
that
congress
didn't
have
to
say
we'll
give
the
governor
a
voice.
justice
o'connor
would
you...
would
you
be
so
kind
as
to
tell
me
in
this
case
whether
you
claim
that
the
president
called
the
guard
to
honduras
under
one
of
the
three
purposes
of
the
militia
clause?
justice
o'connor
well,
were
they
called
under
the
training
clause
of
the
militia
clause?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
it...
is
it
clear
that
the
framers
thought
that
congress
could
prevent
the
states
from
setting
up
their
own
militia
and
giving
them
equipment?
justice
o'connor
the
petitioner
says
that
congress
has
also
forbidden
the
states
to
have
an
organized
militia
except
under
the
terms
that
congress
has
provided,
which
also
makes
them
part
of
the
national
reserve
component.
is
that
correct?
