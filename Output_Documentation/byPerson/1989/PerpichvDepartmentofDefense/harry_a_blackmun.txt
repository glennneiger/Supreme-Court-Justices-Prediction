the
unorganized,
you
do
not
have
in
minnesota?
justice
blackmun
this
is
what
i
meant
by
my
part
of
the
question
that
minnesota
hasn's
chosen
to...
to
go
along
this
line
yet.
justice
blackmun
general
starr,
as
an
old
buck
private
in
the
rear
rank
of
a
minnesota
guard,
i
can
say
that
not
a
one
of
us
in
the
rear
rank
would
understand
this
argument
today.
[laughter]
we...
we
knew
that
we
had
to
go
to
camp
ripley...
you
won't
know
where
that
is,
but
mr.
tunheim
will.
or
to,
indeed,
lake
city.
but
the
thought
of
this
dichotomy
would
be
too
much
for
the
ignoramuses,
such
as
i,
that
were
in
that
rear
rank.
i'm
delighted
to
learn
about
the
minnesota
national
guard.
