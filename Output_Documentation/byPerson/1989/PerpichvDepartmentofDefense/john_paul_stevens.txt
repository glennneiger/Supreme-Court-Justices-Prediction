justice
stevens
general
starr,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
justice
stevens
on
the
basic
notion
of
the
dual
enlistment
system,
do
i
correctly
understand
you
to
say
that
the
states
really
have
no
alternative,
they
cannot
operate
a
separate
militia
as
contemplated
by
the
militia
clause,
if
congress
says
the
only
militia
you
can
have
has
to
have
this
dual
status?
do
they
have
any
kind
of
option
under
the
constitution?
justice
stevens
but
can
they
have...
if
they
don't
participate
in
the
national
guard
system,
may
they
have
their
own
separate
militia?
justice
stevens
no.
justice
stevens
can
they
have
the
militia...
whatever
that
term
means
in
the
militia
clause
of
the
constitution,
can
they
have
that
animal
without
having
that
animal
become
part
of
the
united
states
army?
justice
stevens
i
thought
earlier
you
said
that
they
couldn't.
that's
why
i'm
really
puzzled.
justice
stevens
well,
they
want
to
have
a
militia
that
would
be
available
to
become
part
of
the
united
states
if
war
should
be
declared.
they
want
to
train
their
own
people,
and
so
forth,
according
to
the
discipline
prescribed
by
congress.
but
you
say
they
cannot
do
that,
because
that
would
be
maintaining
troops
in
violation
of--
justice
stevens
--what
section
is
this?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
they
can
only
be
called,
according
to
the
constitution,
into
the
service
of
the
united
states
for
the
three
purposes
that
are
specified:
to
execute
the
laws
of
the
union,
suppress
insurrection
and
repel
invasion.
justice
stevens
that's
quite
different
from
calling
them
into
duty
for
the
purposes
of
training
in
honduras.
justice
stevens
of
course,
those
cases
are
easy
when
you
get
a
time
of
crisis.
the
question
is
what
about
training
when
you're
not
in
a
time
of
crisis?
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you?
what
do
you
think
the
word
militia
means
in
the
constitution?
justice
stevens
which
we
aren't--
justice
stevens
--all
right.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
i
don't
know
what
i
was
now.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
may
i
ask--
justice
stevens
--may
i
ask
one
other
question?
is
the
argument
you're
making
today
the
same
argument
you
submitted
in
your
brief?
have
you
changed
your
position
at
all?
i
didn't
really...
i
had
a
different
view
of
your
position
in
your
written
brief
than
i
do
now.
justice
stevens
for
example,
i
don't
think
you
relied
at
all
on
the
troops...
the
prohibition--
justice
stevens
--it
involves
training
in
a
time
when
there's
no
emergency.
justice
stevens
they
wear
two
hats,
and
as
i
understand
it
now,
and
frankly
i
didn't...
but
they
must
wear
two
hats,
too.
that's
what
i...
that's
the
impression
i
have
from
your
whole
argument.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
what
you
think
the
term
militia
means
in
the
constitution?
justice
stevens
but...
but
the
power
to
organize
the
militia
is
given
to
congress.
