mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
army
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution
provides
in
broad
terms
that
the
congress
shall
have
power
to
raise
and
support
armies,
and
consistent
with
the
breadth
of
the
text
of
the
constitution
this
court
has
broadly
construed
this
clause
and
the
powers
that
are
granted
under
this
clause.
the
court
has
described
the
powers
granted
under
it
as
plenary,
as
broad
and
sweeping
and,
importantly
for
purposes
of
this
case,
as
not
limited
by
the
militia
clauses.
coupled
with
the
necessary
and
proper
clause,
there
is
little
doubt...
and
we
have
heard
today...
that
there
is
no
dispute
that
congress
had
the
power
under
the
army
clause
to
create
an
entity.
that
entity
is
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states,
and
it
created
it
as
a
component
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
when
it
created
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states
in
1933,
congress
was
very
clear.
it
relied
expressly
on
this
court's
world
war
i
decisions
in
the
selective
draft
law
cases
and
cox
against
wood.
and
the
theory
of
those
cases
is
that
to
the
extent
that
congress
exercises
its
powers
under
the
army
clause
the
efficacy,
the
sweep
of
the
militia
clause
is
thereby
limited.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
correct.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
precisely
our
position
because
of
what
this
entity
is.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
it
did
not.
the
president
did
not,
or
the
secretary,
and
the
authority
did
not.
this
is
not--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no,
they
were
not.
they
were
called
under
the
army's
clause.
they
were
called
in
their
capacity
as
part
of
the
army
and
air
force
of
the
united
states.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
congress
was
acting
in
1933
under
its
army
clause
powers,
not
under
its
organization--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--this
is
critical,
justice
kennedy.
section
311
speaks
of
the
national
guard.
you're
quite
right.
what
i'm
speaking
of
is
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states.
there
are
two
separate
entities.
that
is
the
thrust,
that
is
the
essence
of
the
dual
enlistment
concept.
if
i
leave
nothing
else
today,
i
want
to
leave
the
court
with
that
clear
distinction.
an
individual
who
serves
in
his
or
her
national
guard
unit
serves
in
two
capacities.
that
individual
is,
indeed,
a
state
militia
person,
but
that
person
also
since
1933
takes
an
oath
of
allegiance
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
to
obey
the
orders
of
the
president,
and
the
congress
has
seen
fit
to
give
powers
both
unto
itself
in
its
exercise
of
army
clause
powers
to
make
use
of
this
reserve
component,
and
it's
a
critical
part
of
the
reserves.
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states,
when
it
goes
to
honduras,
when
it
goes
as
it
is
now--
as
we
speak,
approximately
4,000
national
guardspersons
are
in
training
operations
in
south
korea.
some
of
those
individuals
who
have
been
involved
in
that
exercise
are
from
minnesota.
they
are
not
there
in
their
militia
hats.
they
do
wear
those
hats
when
they
return
to
minnesota
and
the
other
states,
but
when
they
have
been
summoned
under
the
authority
of
672(b),
they
are
summoned
in
their
capacity
as
members
of
the
reserves
of
the
united
states
armed
forces.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
several
points.
there
is
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
any
state
to
maintain
a
national
guard.
the
federal
statutes--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
governor
cannot
violate
article
i,
section
9
of
the
constitution
with
respect
to
maintaining
troops
in
peacetime
without
congress'
consent.
congress
has
consented,
as
we
have
heard
today,
to
the
creation
of
state
defense
forces,
and
we
see
that
in
federal...
i'm
sorry?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
in
terms
of
maintaining...
it
depends
on
whether
they
are
troops.
if
they
are...
your
hypothetical,
other
than
karate
training,
contemplated
equipping
these
individuals
with
arms.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
not
at
the
time
of
the
founding.
they
supplied
their
own,
and
for
over
100
years
the
individuals
in
the
militia
were
obliged
to
supply
their
own
arms.
therein
lies
the
purpose
of
the
second
amendment,
to
maintain
the
right
of
the
people
to
bear
their
arms
so
they
can
serve
in
the
militia.
under
your
hypothetical,
the
governor
is
seeking
to
create
an
armed
force.
that
he
can
only
do
with
the
consent
of
congress.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
unless
it
comes
within
109(c),
which
is
the
provision
for
state
defense
forces.
congress
has
consented
to
the
creation
of--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--exactly.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
cannot
equip
individuals
without
the
consent
of
congress.
may
i...
may
i,
however,
add
this
very
critical
point?
the
militia
is
contemplated
by
the
founders.
this
is
clear
as
can
be.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
dispute
that
the
militia
was
viewed
as
it
is
used
in
the
constitution,
as
the
able-bodied
populace,
able
to
pick
up
and
bear
arms
to
defend.
it
did
not
mean
those
individuals
who
are
serving
in
a
particular
unit.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
true.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
in
this
respect,
that
is
exactly
right,
that
congress
has
not
been
exercising
its
militia
powers,
which
it
does
have
under
clause
15,
to
organize,
and
we
think
that
includes
defining
who
is
serving
in
the
militia.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
in
terms
of
giving
them
equipment,
i
don't
think
the
record
is
clear
on
that,
but
what
we
do
know
is
that
the
congress
in
1792
determined
that
the
individuals
who
would
in
fact
be
serving
in
the
militia,
all
able-bodied
persons,
would
supply
their
own,
and
it
certainly
was--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--oh,
i'm
sorry,
not
militia,
but
may
not
maintain
troops
in
peacetime
without
the
consent
of
congress.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
article
i,
section
9,
which
limits
the
powers
of
the
states.
"no
state
shall,
without
the
consent
of
congress,
lay
in
a
duty
of
tonnage,
keep
troops
or
ships
of
war
in
time
of
peace.
"
and
so
forth.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
as
long
as
the
individuals
do
not
rise
to
the
level
of
troops,
there
is
no
question
that
the
governor...
first
of
all,
the
governor
enjoys--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
is
not
involved
here,
at
all.
that
is
correct,
justice
kennedy.
what
is
involved
here--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
only
control
is
that
of
the
appointment
of
officers,
clause
16,
and
the
authority
of
training
the
militia
according
to
the
discipline
prescribed
by
congress.
that
is
to
say,
congress
could,
if
it
saw
fit,
summon
forth
all
able-bodied
persons
into
service
of
the
country.
it
could
authorize
the
president
to
do
that.
that
is
precisely
what
the
president
did,
and
that's
what
congress
has
authorized
it
to
do,
in
providing
for
military
training
for
those
persons
who
wear
their
twin
hats,
their
double
hats.
these
individuals
are
being
trained
in
honduras
or
south
korea
or
europe
or
elsewhere
as
members
of
the
reserves
of
the
united
states
armed
forces,
and
this
is
critical.
this
is
absolutely
critical,
that
as
a
practical
matter,
since
the
1970s,
u.s.
strategic
doctrine
is
such
that
the
use
of
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states
as
members
of
the
reserve
component
of
the
armed
forces
is
critical.
as
we
outline
in
our
brief
at
a
time
of
full
mobilization,
18
of
the
army's
combat
divisions,
18
of
the
28,
would
be
national
guard
of
the
united
states
units.
a
very
substantial
part
of
the
united
states
air
force
is
the
united
states
national
guard
air
force,
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
this
is...
i
would
say,
it's
an
exercise
of
the
army's
clause
power.
i
don't
think
there's
any
override,
because
the
state
interest
that
is
involved
here
is
a
very
strange
one.
what
the
governor
is
seeking
to
do
is
not
to
forbid
overseas
training
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
there's
no
objection
to
their
being
trained
in
south
korea
and
europe.
what
the
governor
has
sought
to
do
is
to
play
a
role
in
the
foreign
policy
and
defense
policy
of
the
united
states,
to
say
they
should
not
be
trained
in
central
america,
even
though
troops
are
employed
in
central
america
and
national
guard
of
the
united
states
troops
are
employed
and
were
employed
in
the
panamanian
operation,
they
were
employed
in
the
grenadan
operation,
they
were
employed
in
the
libyan
air
strike,
and
they
have
been
employed
in
all
major
activities
of
the
nation's
armed
forces
since
the
creation
of
the
national
guard
in
'33.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no.
there
was
no
gubernatorial--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--there
was
no
gubernatorial
objection,
because
i
think
until
quite
recently
there
was
no
sense
at
all
that
there
was
any
basis
for
objecting
to
the
training
of
individuals
in
their
capacities
as
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
again,
that
is
what
these
individuals
are.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
they
certainly
have
the
option
not
to
participate
in
the
national
guard
system,
that
is
clear.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
they
may
have
their
own
state
defense
forces--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
are
carrying
out
militia
functions.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes,
they
can.
i
don't
see
any
reason
constitutionally
that
they
cannot.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
concern
i
have
is
with
respect
to
consent
with
respect
to
maintaining
troops.
it
has
to
do
with
what
the
function
is.
if
the
function
of
the
state
defense
forces,
as
it
is,
is
to
maintain
law
and
order
and
to
respond
in
terms
of
emergencies
and
the
like,
then
they
certainly
do
have
that
power
to
maintain
that
sort
of
entity.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
in
addition,
what
congress
has
seen
fit
to
do
is
to
define
in
federal
law
the
militia
of
the
united
states,
and
it
is
indicated
that
that
consists
of
all
able-bodied
males
of
a
certain
age.
it
then
breaks
the
militia
into
two
classes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
this
is
10
united
states
code
section
311,
and
the
organized
militia
is
then
defined
as
the
national
guard
and
the
naval
militia.
now,
congress
has
seen
fit,
as
i
say,
to
provide
for
the
creation
of
state
defense
forces,
but
congress
has
the
power
given
to
it
at
the
founding
in
the
constitution
to
provide
for
organizing
and
arming
and
disciplining
the
militia,
so
congress
can,
in
fact,
organize
it
and
has
done
so.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
i
take
issue
with
that
in
terms
of
the
definition
in
the
constitution
of
the
militia.
that
is
to
say,
the
militia
is
not
defined,
and
it
was
understood...
it
was
understood
at
the
founding
that
the
militia
consisted
of
a
body
of
persons.
those
individuals
may,
in
fact,
be
called
into
the
service
of
the
united
states.
that
has
the
effect
of
preempting
any
state
functions
that
those
individuals
might
in
fact
otherwise
be
carrying
on.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
quite
true.
they
can
only
be
called...
the
militia
can
only
be
called
into
service--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that's
quite
right,
and
that's
why
congress
in
fact
exercised
army
clause
powers
in
1933.
it
did
not
exercise
militia
clause
powers.
if
one
looks
at
the
background
of
what
congress
did,
congress
did
not
say,
we
are
exercising
our
rights
to
organize
the
militia,
clause
16.
we're
doing
that
in
order
to
prepare
for
the
exercise
of
clause
15
powers.
not
at
all.
they
said,
we're
exercising
our
army
clause
powers.
that's
what
we're
exercising,
and
these
individuals
are
becoming
members
of
the
reserves,
of
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
it
means
item
(2),
(b)(2),
means
that
part
of
the
pool
of
able-bodied
persons
defined
in
(a),
the
militia
of
the
united
states
consists
of
all...
in
fact,
it's--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no.
what
it
means
is,
they
have
not
been
organized.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
they
haven't
been
organized
at
all.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
that's
not
true.
cannot
have
a
militia--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--our
definitional
difficulties
are
arising
by
virtue
of
different
uses
of
the
term
"militia".
the
term
"militia"
as
used
in
the
constitution,
as
i
see
it,
has
to
do
with
those
able-bodied
persons
who
can
in
fact
be
summoned
by
the
state,
by
the
governor...
and
the
governor
has
that
power.
this
is
important.
the
montgomery
amendment
does
not...
does
not...
even
if
one
were
to
say
this
is
the
militia,
the
montgomery
amendment
simply
says,
governor,
you
can't
object
to
their
training
as
armed
forces
of
the
united
states
on
these
four
enumerated
grounds.
if
you
need
them...
if
you
need
them
in
minnesota,
you
can
keep
them
in
minnesota.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
certainly
implies
that
those
individuals
who
are
in
the
unorganized
militia
may
become
organized.
now,
congress
has
been
given
the
power
to
organize.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
in
terms
of
maintain...
as
long
as
they
do
not
run
afoul...
it's
not
involved
in
this
case,
but
as
long
as
they
do
not
run
afoul
of
the
maintaining
troops
in
wartime...
in
time
of
peace.
i
see...
there's
nothing
specific
that
says,
you
cannot
take
certain
actions.
what
we
do
have
in
federal
law
are
authorizations
to
establish
state
defense
forces,
and
30
states
have
availed
themselves
of
that,
and
that
is
completely
outside
the
ambit
of
the
national
guard.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct.
they
can...
they
can
organize,
but
that
power
can
in
fact,
it
seems
to
me,
be
overridden,
if
congress
sees
fit
to
exercise
its
clause
16
power.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
yes.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
fully
agree
with
that.
[laughter]
and
many
of
those
questions
have
been
discussed
at
length
here.
if
one
reads
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
en
banc,
one
sees,
it
seems
to
me,
a
very
clear
and
correct
opinion.
when
judge
magill,
in
writing
for
the
overwhelming
majority
of
the
en
banc
court,
comes
to
the
conclusion,
at
that
part
where
he
says,
congress
was
exercising
its
army
clause
powers
here,
and
that
power
is
sufficient
to
establish
the
armed
forces
of
the
united...
to
include
in
the
armed
forces
of
the
united
states,
these
individuals,
that
is
the
end
of
this
case.
congress'
power
is
plenary.
there
is
no
question.
getting
back
to
justice
o'connor's
earlier
questions.
there
is
no
question
that
these
individuals
were
in
federal
status.
whatever
the
limits
of
power,
there
is
no
question
that
they
were
in
federal
status.
indeed,
they
need
to
be
in
federal
status
in
order
to
enjoy
federal
benefits,
in
order
to
enjoy
federal
protections
under
status
of
forces
agreements.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that,
although
not
involved
in
this
case,
i
must
state
that
that
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
this
is
an
extremely
limited
regulation.
this
is
a
system
of
cooperative
federalism
that
works
very
well.
it
worked
extraordinarily
well
until
governors
sought
to
play
a
role
on
the
stage
of
foreign
policy,
and
then
congress
stepped
in.
it
stepped
in
narrowly;
it
stepped
in
precisely.
but,
to
get
to
your
theory,
i
think
that
is
the
theory
of
the
case
in
selective
draft
law
cases.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
when
these
individuals...
the
answer
is...
is
no.
but
when
these
individuals
have
been
summoned
to
serve
their
country,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
doubt
that
congress
has
the
power
to
pass
a
law
that
has
the
effect
of
summoning
all
able-bodied
persons
to
serve
their
country.
that
has
the
effect...
and
that's
what
chief
justice
white
recognized
in
selected
draft
law
cases,
he
recognized
it
again
in
cox
against
wood,
that
that
has
the
inevitable
effect
of
shrinking
the
compass,
shrinking
the
operation
of
the
militia
clauses.
congress
does
not
do
that.
it
does
not
do
that
because
madison
saw
it
at
the
founding.
that
there
were
protections...
there
were
political
protections,
that
states
are
represented
in
the
congress
of
the
united
states.
but
in
terms
of
pure
theory,
pure
theory,
the
pure
theory
of
selective
draft
law
cases
is
when
it...
and
it
stands
to
reason,
that
were
we
truly
in
a
time
of
crisis,
and
the
nation
needed
the
help
of
every
able-bodied
person,
then
we
ask
the
congress--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that's
correct.
this
is
not
the--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
it
means
the
pool
of
able-bodied
persons
who
are
able
to
serve
their
country
or
to
serve
their
state.
i
think
it
means
a
pool
of
persons.
and
that
is
the
definition,
in
effect,
that
was
given
to
the
militia
in
1792
by
the
initial
militia
act
that
remained
in
effect
until
1903.
the
militia
is
you
and
i,
if
we're
of
a
certain
age
category--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--who
can
be--
[laughter]
i
am
still
in
the
militia.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
others,
i
suppose,
are
emeriti
members
of...
of...
of
the
militia.
[laughter]
i
think--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
i
think
that's
what
the
militia
clauses
of
the
constitution
are
getting
at.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
they're
talking
about
that
pool
of
persons
who
can
be
summoned.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
and--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--oh,
i
did
that
only
in
response
to
questions
about
what
is
the
authority
of
governors
to
go
and
organize
militia
units?
that's
correct.
this
case
is
a
very
narrow
case.
the
argument
has
very
been
wide
ranging.
but
the
case,
the
issue
that
is
before
the
court
is
exceptionally
narrow,
that
does
not
require
us
to
visit--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
is
correct.
but
the
critical
point,
justice
stevens,
is,
what
are
these
individuals
when
they
are
"being
trained"?
they
are
troops
of
the
united
states.
they
wear
two
hats.
when
they
went
to
honduras,
they
were
wearing
their
federal
hats.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
national
guard,
since...
that
is
correct.
to
be
in
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states
one
must
be
in
the
national
guard,
the
state
national
guard.
there
may
be
some
individuals
who
are
members
of
the
national
guard
but
who
are
not
members
of
the
national
guard
of
the
united
states.
i
understand
there
are
a
few
persons
in
that
category,
but
you're
quite
right,
since
1933,
an
individual
to
sign
up,
to
enlist
in
the
national
guard,
enlists
in
both.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
may
i
respond
very
briefly
to
that?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
thank
the
court.
