justice
scalia
there's
nothing
in
the
nature
of
things
that
requires
it
to
be
that
way,
i
suppose.
i
mean,
if
the
governor
wants
to
be
able
to
prohibit
his
military
force
from
training
abroad,
or
wants
to
be
able
to
direct
it
in
all
respects
at
all
times,
i
suppose
that
he
could
expend
the
money
to
make
the
unorganized
militia
a
full-fledged
fighting
force,
buy
them
tanks
and
planes,
which
now
the
federal
government
supplies.
justice
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
organized
militia?
i
mean,
you're
talking
about
it
as
though
you
can't
have
tanks
if
you're
an
organized...
if
you're
an
unorganized...
is
the
term
defined,
"unorganized
militia"?
justice
scalia
define
the
term
"organized".
i
mean,
i
think
we're
playing
with
words
here.
it
seems
to
me
all
the
federal
statute
says
is
that
a
state
can
have
two
kinds
of
militia,
one
which
we'll
call
the
"organized
militia",
can
be
called
up
and
it's
the
united
states
national
guard,
and
the
other,
if
the
state
wants
to
have
another
one,
the
states
can
do
with
what
they
want.
but
is
there
any
federal
definition
of
"organized"?
justice
scalia
well,
if
that's
all
it
means,
then
you
can
create
one
that
isn't
the
national
guard,
and
that
will
be
the
unorganized
militia.
justice
scalia
oh,
i
don't
think
they
are
or
are
not
a
militia
simply
because
minnesota
chooses
to
call
them
or
not
to
call
them
a
militia.
i
mean,
a
militia
is
a
militia.
surely
by
simply
not
giving
them
a
name
minnesota
doesn't
deprive
them
of
that
character.
justice
scalia
but
they
can
be
militia
but
not
organized
militia.
and
certainly,
organized
really
doesn't
mean
that
they
have
no
organization
because,
as
you
say,
even
minnesota
in
world
war
ii
had
a
home
guard
which
was,
i
assume,
organized.
they
had
officers
and
subordinates
and
so
forth?
justice
scalia
so
it
was
organized
in
some
sense.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
you
say
they
were
organized
pursuant
to
congress'
power.
is
there
anything
that
would
have
prevented
the
governor
of
minnesota
from
simply
issuing
an
order
saying
that
henceforth
what
has
been
the...
the
state
national
guard
is
now
denominated
the
state
unorganized
militia?
could
he
do
that?
justice
scalia
he
just
gives
it
a
new
name.
he
says
this
is
no
longer
minnesota's
organized
militia.
now
the
consequence
of
that
will
be
that
we
would
get
no
federal
assistance,
no
tanks,
planes
and
so
forth,
no
firearms
from
the
federal
government,
but
it
would
be
our...
our
own
unorganized
militia
that
we
can
train
wherever
we
want.
is
there
anything
in
law
that
would
prevent
him
from
doing
that
if
he
did
not
want
a
federally
funded
state
national
guard?
justice
scalia
fine.
it
wouldn't
be
called
an
organized
militia,
but
it
would
be
the
same
unit,
the
same
officers,
the
same
enlisted
personnel.
he
could
do
that,
couldn't
he?
just
give
it
a
different
name.
you
are
henceforth
an
unorganized
militia.
and
the
only
consequence
of
that
would
be
he'd
get
no
federal
money.
justice
scalia
that's
right.
justice
scalia
but
this
is...
he's
called
it
an
unorganized
militia.
justice
scalia
well,
he's
chosen
to
do
that.
he's
chosen
otherwise.
so,
really,
all
you're
complaining
about
is
you
want
the
federal
money
but
you
don't
want
to
be
subject
to
federal
training
orders.
yeah.
justice
scalia
general
starr,
is
it
within
the
power
of
a
governor
of
a
state
to
say
i
want
to
have
my
own
militia
that
works
for
me
full-time,
i
am
willing
to
fund
them,
to
buy
their
arms
or
they
will
fight
with
karate
if
necessary,
but
i
do
not
want
them
to
be
part
of
the
national
guard,
and,
therefore,
i
am
establishing
a
state
militia
that
will
be
an
unorganized
militia,
we
will
have
no
organized
militia.
can
a
governor
do
that?
justice
scalia
why
don't
you
answer
yes
or
no
and
then
go
on
and
tell
me?
can
a
governor
do
that?
justice
scalia
i
thought
the
constitution
allows
the
state
to
have
a
militia.
they
can't
have
a
militia
without
congress'
consent?
justice
scalia
well,
i
assume
militia
have
arms.
don't
you
think
that--
justice
scalia
--i
see.
well,
this
is
a
harder
case
than
i
thought,
then.
you...
you
are
saying,
then,
that
the
state
cannot
have
a...
a
militia
that
it
arms
unless...
any
militia
it
arms
will
automatically
be
subject
to
this
dual
system.
it
cannot
avoid
it.
justice
scalia
that's
a
matter
of
grace.
justice
scalia
and
you're
saying
that
congress
can
set
it
up
in
such
fashion
that
the
state
cannot
have
any
militia
of
its
own
which
it
arms
that
cannot
be
subject
to
the
beck
and
call
of...
of
the
united
states?
justice
scalia
that
means
full-time
troops,
isn't
that
the
meaning?
the
militia,
you
know,
the
minuteman,
he's
a
farmer
and
then
he's
called
to
service,
but
when
he's
called
to
service
it
doesn't
mean
he
can't
use
a
tank.
i
don't
know
how
you
read
that
to
say
that
the
state
can't
arm
them,
as
opposed
to
meaning
that
the
state
cannot
have
a
full-time
army,
but
that's
not
what
we're
talking
about
here.
justice
scalia
well,
mr.
starr,
when
section
311
says
that...
in
311(b)...
the
classes
of
the
militia
are
(1)
the
organized
militia,
which
consists
of
the
national
guard
and
the
naval
militia,
(2)
the
unorganized
militia,
which
consists
of
the
members
of
the
militia
who
are
not
members
of
the
national
guard
or
the
naval
militia,
does
"organized"
and
"unorganized"
have
any
objective
meaning,
or
is
it
just
a
convenient
term
to
refer
to
those
militia
that
are
the
national
guard
and
those
militia
that
aren't?
justice
scalia
what
does
"unorganized"
mean?
i
mean,
does
it
mean
that
they
can't
be
organized?
justice
scalia
they
haven't
been
federally
organized?
justice
scalia
so
a
state
cannot
have
any
organized
militia
that
isn't
part
of
the
national
guard.
they
can
also--
justice
scalia
--well,
they
have
to
be
federally
organized?
justice
scalia
i'm
trying
to
get
back
to
whether
the
governor
can
organize
them.
i
mean,
surely
the...
surely
the
state's
ability
to
train
them
includes
the
ability
to
organize
them.
the
state
cannot
have
an
organized
militia,
it
can
only
have...
you
know,
able-bodied
men
out
there
who
may
have
their
own
rifles,
and
it
can't
even
appoint
officers
and...
i
mean,
the
appointment
of
the
officers
is
left
to
the
state.
that
implies
organization,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
so
you
really
think
the
unorganized
militia
means...
in
this
statute
means
unorganized,
that
the
state
has
no
independent
authority
to
organize
a
militia,
all
it
can
do
is
designate
a
bunch
of
people
who
we
say,
you
are
militia,
but
we
can't
organize
you
without
federal
consent.
is
that
the
government's
position?
justice
scalia
i
think
you've
said
they
can
organize,
so
long
as
they
don't
run
afoul
of
the
maintaining
troops
clause,
whatever
that
might
mean.
right?
justice
scalia
general
starr,
i
have
no
doubt
that
congress'
power
is
plenary,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
we're
going
to
read
congress'
power
to
totally
eliminate
another
power,
namely,
the
power
of
the
states
to
maintain
militia,
any
more
than
we
would
enable
congress
to...
to
draft
all
state
governments,
and
say
all
members
of
state
governments
are
automatically
members
of
the
national
guard,
and
we
may
send
them
abroad
at
our
will.
that
would
be
destroying
another
governmental
institution
that's
in
the
constitution.
and
what
i'm
concerned
about
is
the
position
you're
taking
is
indeed,
in
fact,
that
that's
what
the
government
can
do.
that
by
simply
waving
a
wand
over
the
state
militia
and
saying
you
are
now
federal
militia,
the
government,
you
are
saying,
i
think,
can
eliminate
the
power
that
was
reserved
to
the
states
to
have
their
own
militia
and
to
train
them.
