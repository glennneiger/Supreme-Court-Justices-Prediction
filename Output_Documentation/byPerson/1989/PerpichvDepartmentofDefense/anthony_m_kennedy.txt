justice
kennedy
i
take
it...
i
take
it
you're
saying
that
it's
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
divide
by
statute,
as
it
has
done,
the
national
guard
segment
of
the
militia
and
the
so-called
unorganized
militia?
that
is
also
unconstitutional
in
your
view,
i
take
it?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
section
311
of
title
10
says
that
the
classes
of
the
militia
are
the
organized
militia,
which
consist
of
the
national
guard,
and
the
unorganized
militia,
which
is
not
the
national
guard.
so
you
have
to
say
that
that
also
is
unconstitutional,
i
take
it,
to
prevail?
justice
kennedy
are
you
questioning
the
constitutionality
of
the
dual
enlistment
system?
justice
kennedy
well,
it's
rather
odd
to
say
that
congress
has
the
authority,
as
you
just
conceded,
to
have
dual
enlistment
and
then
not
permit
the
federal
government
to
make
that
choice
an
effective
one
and
to
use
all
of
its
powers
to
make
sure
that
the
dual
enlistment
system
works.
justice
kennedy
for...
for
the
organized
militia,
which
is
your
point?
justice
kennedy
could
congress
have
had
power
to
call
the
militia
of
minnesota
what
we
call
the
national
guard
to
honduras
for
a
year
to
execute
the
laws
of
the
united
states
under
clause
15?
justice
kennedy
and
the
governor
would
have
no
veto
power
with
reference
to
that?
justice
kennedy
so
that
means
we
are
in
a
position
where
we
can't
train
them
to
do
some
of
the
things
that
we
have
to
call
them
forth
to
do?
justice
kennedy
well,
when...
when
the
national
guard
was
created,
was
congress
acting
pursuant
to
its
power
to
organize
the
militia?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
section
310
says
that
there
is
the
organized
militia,
which
is
the
national
guard.
and
it
seems
to
me
very
odd
for
you
to
say
that
the
militia
clause,
the
organization
clause,
is
not
being
relied
upon
when
they
create
the
national
guard.
i
just
can't
square
that
with
section
310.
justice
kennedy
but
the
framers,
general
starr,
were
very
careful
to
say
that
congress
has
the
authority
to
organize
that
militia?
justice
kennedy
and
you
have
been
very
careful
to
say
that
that
isn't
what's
happening
here.
justice
kennedy
but
that's
not
involved
here,
is
it,
mr.
starr?
justice
kennedy
what
troubles
me
is
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
authority
to
organize
and
arm
the
militia,
not
to
create
it,
and
the
state
has
the
right
to
create
it,
and
there's
a
reserved
right
of
the
state
to
control
it.
there
is
reserved
power
in
the
governor
to
control
the
militia,
is
there
not,
under
the
constitution?
justice
kennedy
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
war
power
here
is
being
used,
in
effect,
to
override
a
reserved
power
given
to
the
states
under
article
16?
justice
kennedy
did
any
governors
object
to
any
of
those
instances
you
mentioned?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
there
was
no
constitutional
problem.
justice
kennedy
do
you
know
of
any
authority
for
the
proposition
that
an
express
power
given
to
congress
can
override
an
express
limitation
on
congress'
power
under
some
other
provision
of
the
constitution?
