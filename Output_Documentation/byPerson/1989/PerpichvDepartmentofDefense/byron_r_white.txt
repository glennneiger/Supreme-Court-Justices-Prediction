the
power
of
training
reserved
to
the
state
was
to
be
exercised
according
to
the
discipline
prescribed
by
congress.
what
does
that
mean?
justice

you
mean,
does
that--
justice

--the
standards
and
what
they're
supposed
to
teach
them?

so
the
states
would
just
be...
would
just
be...
sort
of
a,
just
carrying
out
what
congress
says
they
must
do.
justice
white
what
is
that...
what
is
that
authority
over
the
training?
what
if
the
congress
says
twice
a
year
you
will
train,
and
here's
what
you
will...
here's
the
routine
you
will
go
through,
and
the
state
has
absolutely
no
discretion
about
either
time
or
place
or
what
they
are
supposed
to
do
when
they
train.
justice
white
is
that
right?
