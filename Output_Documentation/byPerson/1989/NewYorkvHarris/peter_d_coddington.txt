mr.
peter
d.
coddington
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
your
honor,
i
know
you're
all
aware
of
the
facts
in
this
case
so
i'm
not
going
to
dwell
on
them.
rather,
we
believe
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
erred
on
four
fronts
in
this
case.
and,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
concentrate
on
our
first
two
arguments
primarily
while
i'm
at
this
podium.
we
believe
that
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
misunderstood
brown
and
its
progeny
by
holding
that
a
precinct
confession,
totally
voluntary,
given
outside
of
a
man's
house,
should
be
suppressed
because
the
police
arrested
him
in
his
home
without
a
warrant.
now,
i
believe
they
misapplied
brown.
brown
merely
holds
that
mirandas
will
not
attenuate
a
fourth
amendment
violation
in
every
case.
the
opinion
says
so,
that
miranda
warnings
by
themselves
will
not
always
attenuate.
however,
brown
also
did
not
adopt
any
"but
for"
standard...
but
for
a
fourth
amendment
violation
a
confession
so
be
suppressed.
brown,
taylor
and
dunaway,
the
three
cases
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
relied,
hold
merely
that
when
the
confession
is
the
product
of
prolonged
involuntary
detention
without
probable
cause,
then
a
confession
should
be
suppressed.
in
those
cases,
the
confession
comes
as
a
result
of
the
fourth
amendment
violation.
that
is,
holding
a
man
without
probable
cause
in
violation
of
his
fourth
amendment
rights.
where,
however,
in
a
case
like
this
where
there
is
ample
probable
cause,
i
submit
that
the
vice
that
led
to
the
brown,
dunaway
and
taylor
holdings
is
absent.
once
this
man
was
taken
outside
of
his
house,
the
detention
was
completely
lawful
for
forth
amendment
purposes.
therefore,
the
perfectly
voluntary
confession
given
later
at
a
public
place,
the
police
precinct,
i
submit
should
have
been
admissible.
now--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--yes,
sir.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
that's...
that's
precisely...
that's
my
second
point,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
we
believe
also
that
the--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
i
believe
we
get
into
attenuation.
with
respect
to
the
brown
holding,
my
position
is
that
if
there
is
probable
cause,
miranda
warnings
by
themselves
should
attenuate
and
there's
no
need
to
go
through
the
three-fold
factors.
okay?
but
i
also
agree
that
the
payton
rule...
i
think
there
should
be
a
bright-line
rule
here
that
payton
applies
to
evidence
that
is
seized
or
perhaps
observed
in
the
home,
and
that
evidence
that
is
taken
outside
the
home
should
not
be
suppressed
as
a
violation
of
payton.
if
that
answers
your
honor's
question.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
that's
right.
and
my
second--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--my
second
point
is
that
payton
applies
only
to
evidence
seized
in
the
house,
and
that
evidence
seized
outside
the
house
should
not
be
suppressed
under
payton.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
if
there
is
a
payton
violation,
and
as
you--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--okay.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
as
you
know,
my
fourth
point
is
that
the
entry
was
consensual,
and
if
so,
there
would
be
no
payton
violation.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
if
you...
for
the
moment--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--okay.
assuming
there
is
a
payton
violation,
i
believe...
and
we've
agreed
in
the
state
courts...
that
the
confession
in
the
apartment
probably
should
be
suppressed.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
that's
right.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
that's
an
extension
that
i
was
not...
did
not
make
in
my
brief.
however--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--i
would...
i
would
certainly
adopt
that--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--here.
but--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--because
that's
the
way
it
was
litigated
in
the
state
courts.
but,
however,
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
adopt
that
position
here.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
that...
that
was
the
point
i
was
making.
but--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
i
think
wong
sun
answers
that.
evidence,
i
believe,
of
confession.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well...
that's
what
this
all
stems
from.
actually,
in
wong
sun,
by
the
way,
the
amicus
makes
the
point
wong
sun
is
completely
different.
wong
sun
was
released
on
his
own
recognizance
by
a
magistrate.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
which
is
quite
different
than
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
amicus
argued
as...
against
one
of
our
arguments
that
perhaps
the
police
should
have
released
this
man
and
then
rearrested
him.
i
submit
that
would
have
been
inappropriate
and
would
not
follow
under
wong
sun.
back
to
justice
stevens'
question.
i
do
submit
that
probable
cause
plus
mirandas
under
normal
circumstances
should
be
enough
to
render
a
confession
voluntary.
and
if
we
can
get
over
the
payton
violation,
then
i
submit
the
confession
in
the
apartment
actually
should
have
been
admissible.
however,
as
i
say,
that
was
suppressed
by
the
state
court,
and
we
only
admitted
the
precinct
confession.
the
man
was
convicted
with
it.
so,
that's
not
really
a
question
that's
before
the
court.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
that's
a
close
question,
your
honor.
the
testimony
was
that
one
officer
had
a
gun
in
his
pocket;
one
had
a
gun
down
by
his
leg.
the
defendant
was
looking
through
a
peep-hole
in
the
door.
so
i
don't
think
that
he
ever
saw
the
guns
when
he
opened
the
door.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
if
he
sees
the
gun,
perhaps
not.
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
evidence
that
this
man
saw
the
guns
when
he
opened
the
door.
and
the
police
testified
they
holstered
their
guns
as
soon
as
they
went
in.
when
he
opened
the
door...
you
know,
they
knocked
on
the
door.
they
said
police.
i
mean,
this
is
not
gulag.
this
is
not
johnson.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
i
think
he
said,
"i'm
glad
you're
here.
"
"come
on
in.
"
i
mean,
i
think
there--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
i
think
you
can
shut
the
door.
that's
what
i'd
do.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
shut
the
door
and
duck,
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
no,
i
think
you
can
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
i
don't
know,
judge...
justice.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
let
me
touch
on
that,
your
honor.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
that's
right.
okay,
let
me--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
under
new
york,
law,
as
your
honor
knows...
as
your
honor
knows,
the
police
cannot
question
a
defendant
without
an
attorney
once
they
have
an
arrest
warrant.
but
as
i
read
these--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
i
have
no
quarrel
with
that
either.
but
there's
nothing
in
any
of
this
court's
decisions
that
says
that
the
sixth
amendment
requires
the
police
to
file
charges
so
the
man
has
an
attorney
just
when
they
have
probable
cause.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
no,
your
honor,
it's
not.
it's
not.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
it
certainly
is
and--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--it
may
have
been
the
custom
of
this
particular
police
officer.
but,
as
i
deal
with
at
length
in
my
reply
brief,
it
certainly
is
not
the
policy
of
the
new
york
city
police
department.
i
mean,
i'm
not
going
to
say
that
some
police
officers
don't
delay
arrests
so
they
can
obtain
confessions.
but
i
submit
that
that's
perfectly
proper.
i
mean,
there's
one
thing
to
flagrantly
disregard
a
constitutional
right.
it's
another
to
tailor
your
conduct
in
conformance
with
the
constitution.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
if
that
was
their
intent
when
they
entered--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--i
agree
that
if
it
was
non-consensual,
it
violated
payton.
but
i
submit
to
your
honor
that...
i
mean,
the
record
here
shows
that
these
police
were
not--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--i
think
so.
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
yes,
i
agree.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
understand,
in
payton
the
police
broke
in
the
door
when
the
man
wasn't
there
and
searched
the
apartment.
here,
in
this
case,
at
page
380
of
the
record,
the
detective,
detective
rivers,
went
to
this
man's
apartment--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
there
was
no
warrant
and
it
was
a
forceful
entry.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
so
far
as
i
know,
none
of
this
court's
opinions
deal
with
anything
like
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
in
welsh
v.
wisconsin
they
came
late
at
night.
the
same
is
true
of
riddick.
in
payton
and
in
brown
the
police
broke
in
the
door.
here,
there
is
a
knock
on
the
door
and
an
apparently
consensual
entry.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
just
suggesting
that
on
this
record
it's
a
most
unclear
question.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
that's
correct,
and
that
was
a
factual
finding
that
was
binding
on
them
which
i
do
not
believe
binds
this
court.
at
least,
not
as
to
the
legal
conclusion.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
which
is
why--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--no.
no.
i
think--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--okay.
so
then
we
will
assume
a
payton
violation.
okay.
assuming
a
payton
violation,
i
believe,
again,
that...
okay,
back
to
justice
stevens'
question.
assuming
a
payton
violation,
i
believe
probably
that
the
confession
in
the
apartment
should
be
suppressed.
i
submit
that
the
confession
at
the
precinct
should--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--that's
just
what
i'm
getting
to.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
i
was
just
trying
to
follow...
follow-up
on
justice
stevens'
question.
i
believe
the
confession
at
the
precinct
should
not
be
suppressed.
one,
that
was
taken
outside
of
the
house.
i
believe
that
payton
should
extend
no
farther
than
the
house.
this
is
a
nice
bright-line
rule
that
the
court
can
enact.
i
think
it
has
an
ease
of
application
that
will
aid
police,
prosecutor,
defense
counsel
and
state
courts
in
application.
i
believe...
touching
back
to
justice
marshall's
question...
that
the
police
behavior
here
was
not
designed
to
violate
the
constitution.
in
hoffa
and
in
levasco,
which
i
believe
your
honor
wrote,
the
court
has
held
that
the
police
do
not
have
to
file
charges
at
the
moment
they
have
probable
cause.
the
court
has
recognized
that
it
is
perfectly
reasonable
for
police
to
go
to
a
man's
house,
knock
on
the
door,
and
attempt
to
question
him
before
they
make
an
arrest.
this
is
perfectly
reasonable
behavior.
and,
as
the
court
knows,
reasonableness
is
the
test
under
which
all
fourth
amendment
decisions
are
rendered.
i
submit
that
the
conduct
here
was
perfectly
reasonable.
so,
i
submit
that
the
confession
at
the
precinct--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--oh,
yes,
but--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--yes.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
yes,
there
was.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
when
the
court
rendered
its
verdict,
it
expressly
discounted...
discredited...
the
defendant's
version.
i
can
get
the
cite
for
that.
it's...
i
believe
it's...
well...
it
is
at...
it
would
be
page
27,
i
believe,
of
the
joint
appendix.
no,
excuse
me,
page
29
of
the
joint
appendix.
"i
cannot
accept
the
defendant's
version
with
respect
to
the
course
of
nature
in
this
statement
or
that
his
statement
was
other
than
voluntary
or
true.
"
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
no,
but
i
think--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--i
think
that's
the
court's
ruling
on
the
entire
testimony
of
the
defendant.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
and
i
think
the
defendant's
testimony
at
trial
started
with
an
involuntary
entry,
gunpoint
questioning,
so
on
and
so
forth,
culminating
in
an
involuntary
confession
at
the
precinct.
i
submit
the
court
specifically
rejected--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--the
court
of
appeals
didn't
precisely
reach
that
issue.
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
brown
factors,
which
is
the
next
point
i'd
like
to
get
to.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
oh,
yes.
yes.
we...
we
agreed
on
that
now.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
i
agree
now.
yes,
i
do.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
i'm
sorry,
judge,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well...
no.
okay.
excuse
me.
i...
i
agree
that
the
police
violated
payton
here.
however,
i
do
not
agree
that
the
precinct
confession
should
be
suppressed.
i
think
that
payton
should
not
apply
to
a
precinct
confession.
i
submit
that
because
there
was
probable
cause
brown
does
not
apply
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
applied
it.
i
submit
that
because
there
was
probable
cause
and
miranda
warnings
that
should
attenuate
the
precinct
confession.
and
in
any
event,
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
misapplied
the
brown
factors
in
finding
this
confession
was--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--oh,
yes.
in
people
v.
lane,
which
is
cited
in
my
brief...
i
believe
it's
64
n.y.
2d.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
yeah,
lane.
now,
see,
in
new
york...
under
new
york
law
one
has
to
file--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
okay.
i
don't
believe
it's--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--yeah,
that's
true.
i
think
that
was
an
unfortunate
mistake,
frankly.
as
you
notice
in
my
reply
brief...
i
mean,
the
policy
of
the
department
is
emphatically
to
the
contrary.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
absolutely
not--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--oh,
no,
no,
no,
no.
but
i
don't
want
to
leave
the
court
with
the
impression
that
the
policy
is
other
than
it
is.
i
mean,
i
would
not
like
a
factual
mistake
to
color
this
court's
judgment.
but
with
respect
to
new
york
law,
a
search
warrant
can
only
be
obtained
once
the
police
have
filed
an
accusatory
instrument.
this
commences
the
action.
it
triggers
the
new
york
right
to
counsel.
in
lane
the
felony
complaint
had
been
signed
but
had
not
been
filed,
and
the
court
of
appeals
approved
an
admissible
confession
there.
the
action
hadn't
commenced.
so,
that
is
the
law
of
the
state
of
new
york.
now,
back
to
the
brown
standards.
for
the
reasons
i'm
arguing,
i
don't
believe
that
the
police
conduct
here
was
purposeful
or
flagrant.
in
brown,
after
all,
they
broke
into
the
man's
house
and
arrested
him
at
gunpoint
as
he
was
coming
home.
here,
the
payton
violation
was
of
the
most
minimal
nature.
it
was
nothing
like
payton,
where
they'd
broken
the
door.
this
is
a
knock
on
the
door,
we're
the
police.
he
says,
"come
on
in.
"
"i'm
glad
you
came
for
me.
"
now,
had
the
hearing
court
found
a
consensual
entry,
which
what
we'd
argued
below,
there
would
have
been
no
payton
violation
at
all.
the
payton--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--oh,
yes.
yes.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
they
said
they
had
a
warrant,
or
misrepresented
they
had
a
warrant,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
and
the
court
held
that
where
there's
a
warrant
there
can't
be
consent.
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
that's
bumper's.
you
know,
here...
i
mean,
had
the
court
found
its
facts
a
little
bit
differently,
there
would
have
been
no
payton
violation.
my
point
is
the
payton
violation
occurred
here,
or
was
found
here
at
the
hearing,
some
months
after
the
entry.
as
justice
stevens
said
in
the
garrison
case...
i
mean,
we
have
to
judge
these
circumstances
as
they
appear
to
the
cops
at
the
door.
knock
on
the
door,
come
on
it,
i'm
glad...
glad
you
came
for
me.
i
mean,
i
submit
that
on
an
objective
view
to
any
reasonable
police
officer
that
would
sound
like
an
invitation
to
enter.
that's
certainly
the
way
it
appeared
to
these
police
officers.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
their
guns
were
down
where
the
defendant
couldn't
see
them.
i...
i
would
admit
that,
you
know,
if
they
were
pointing
them
at
his
head,
it
would
be
different.
but
the
record
is
clear
that
he
could
not
see
the
guns
and
the
guns
were
holstered
as
soon
as
they
went
into...
went
into
the
defendant's
apartment.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
they
were
prepared.
this...
this
was,
after
all,
a
homicide
investigation
and
there
were
three
knives
within
easy
reach,
as
it
appears
once
they
got
into
the
apartment.
but
the
defendant
was
completely
congenial.
i
mean,
as
soon
as
they
saw
each
other,
any
coercive
atmosphere
disappeared.
they
holstered
their
guns.
they
immediately
read
him
his
miranda
rights.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
that
was
the...
yeah,
the
testimony--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
i
submit,
though,
that
in
order
to
find
attenuation--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
okay.
but,
i
mean,
in
terms
of
the
flagrancy
of
the
police
conduct
here,
i
think
it
militates
on
my
side
towards
that.
i
mean,
this
is
clearly
not,
you
know,
a
flagrant
violation
as
has
occurred
in
brown.
this
is--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
there's--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--there
are
two
answers
to
that.
one
is
california
v.
greenwood,
of
course,
in
which
the
court
held
that
notions
of
state
law
should
not
control
for
fourth
amendment
purposes.
and
also...
i
mean,
the
flagrancy...
at
least
as
i
understand
the
case,
it
has
to
be
flagrant
violation
of
the
federal
constitution.
i
mean,
a
state
rule
of
law,
i
submit,
probably
is
not
a
flagrant
violation
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
the--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--to
avoid--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
yeah.
to
avoid
a
new
york
state
constitutional
requirement,
not
a
federal
constitutional
requirement.
patterson
v.
illinois,
that's--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--i
am
not
trying
to
condone
the
police
procedure,
your
honor.
i
am
merely
saying
that
it
is
not
a
flagrant
disregard
of
the
federal
constitution.
this
court
has
recognized--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well,
the
difference
has
to
do
with
the
police
officers'
intent.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
no.
what
would
have
been
flagrant
would
have
been
what
happened
in
brown.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
that
sure
would
have
been
flagrant.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
below
that
would
be
the
facts
as
in
brown,
where
they
break
into
the
man's
apartment,
wait
for
him
to
come
home.
as
he
walks
up
to
the
door,
arrest
him
at
gunpoint.
that's
flagrant.
that's
clearly
flagrant.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
it
sure
would.
but,
i
mean,
here--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--well...
okay.
i
do
believe
if
you
are
going
to
apply
the
brown
attenuation
standards,
you
do
have
to
come
to
grips
with
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it's
flagrant.
as
i
read
the
court's
opinions,
the
flagrancy
of
the
police
conduct
is
one
of
the
most
important
considerations.
so,
i
submit
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
answer
that
question.
i
mean,
there
are
violations.
for
example,
take
united
states
v.
leon
where
the
taint
is
the
good-faith
reliance
on
what
turns
out
to
be
an
invalid
award.
there
should
be
no
suppression
at
all.
i
mean,
now,
there
is
a
violation
that's
not
flagrant.
the
same
may
be
said
of
crews
and
ceccolini
and
in
michigan
v.
tucker
where
the
fourth
amendment
violation
leads
to
the
testimony
of
a
live
witness.
again
we
have
a
violation
that's
not
flagrant.
i
submit
the
same
thing
should
be
said
here.
here
there
is
a
payton
violation,
but
under
the
circumstances
of
the
entry
and
the
police
behavior
and
the
fact
that
they
can
go
to
a
man's
apartment
and
attempt
to
gain
entry
to
question
him,
plainly
the
violation
is
not
flagrant.
your
honors,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
well,
i...
i
don't
think
the...
i
think
they
are
obviously
both...
potentially...
potentially
coercive
events.
i
think
the
fact
that
he
was...
that
an
arrest
in
the
home
is
not
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
of
any
less
significance
than
an
arrest
on
the
street.
we're
not
making
that
argument.
but
to
return
to
detective
rivers--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
have
no
intention
of
taking
all
eight
minutes.
i
expect
to
be
very
brief.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
begin
by
answering
justice
white's
question.
i
submit
that
the
precinct
confession
here
is
by
no
means
the
product
of
the
entry
at
all.
i
think
the
payton
violation
here
is
completely
addressed
the
seizing
whatever
evidence
might
have
been
found
in
the
house,
and
to
extend
it
further
than
that
i
think
would
be
to
apply
a
"but
for"
rule
which
this
court
in
brown
said
was
not
the
law.
so,
i
submit
that
it
is
not
a
product
whatsoever
of
the
entry.
and
i
think
in
terms
of
attenuation
you
can
look
to
the
second
statement
for
evidence
of
attenuation.
it
was
much
more...
much
more
detailed
than
the
first.
the
first
statement
essentially
said,
i
killed
her
because
she
was
an
unfit
mother.
the
second
statement,
about
an
hour
later,
went
through
the
detail
of
the
prior
affair
with
her,
the
abduction,
that
she
lied
to
him,
so
on
and
so
forth,
and
none
of
these
details
were
given
to
the
defendant
by
the
police.
this
all
came
from
his
own
recollection,
his
own
independent
act
of
free
will.
that's
what
i
believe
attenuates
this
confession.
with
respect
to
the
time
factor,
here
it's
about
an
hour.
in
rawlings
i
believe
it
was
about
45
minutes.
so,
i
mean,
there
is
precedent
in
this
court's
opinions
for
the
time
factor
serving
the
effects
of
attenuation.
finally,
back
to
the
non-policy...
i'll
call
it...
of
the
new
york
state
police
department.
remember,
in
the
record
only
one
police
officer
testified
that
it
was
the
custom
to
not
get
warrants.
mccarthy
at
joint
appendix
page
8
said
that
if
the
defendant
hadn't
opened
the
door,
he'd
have
left.
rivers
himself
at
page
380
of
the
record
testified
that
he'd
been
there
once
before.
nobody
was
home.
he
left.
and
why
they
went
to
this
man's
house?
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
okay.
fine.
good.
then
that's--
mr.
peter
d.
coddington
--that's
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make.
and
if
this
goes
to
the
flagrancy
of
the
police
conduct,
which
is
what
most
of
the
thrust
of
the
amicus'
argument
was.
that's
what
i'm
responding
to.
it
is
not
flagrant.
i
believe
it
was...
had
the
facts
been
found
slightly
differently,
it
would
have
been
in
all
respects
lawful.
it
was
not
flagrant.
this
is,
frankly,
i
think
a
clean
case.
this
is
a
case
where
a
hearing
court
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
found
the
facts
differently
than
they
appeared
to
the
police.
and
that's
why
we're
here.
for
all
of
these
reasons,
your
honors,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
misapplied
this
court's
precedence
and
i
ask
you
to
reverse
their
judgment.
