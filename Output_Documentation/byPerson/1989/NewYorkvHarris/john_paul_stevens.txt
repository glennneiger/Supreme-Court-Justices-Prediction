justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
solicitor
general's
argument.
go
back
to
your
first
point
a
minute.
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
your
response
to
justice
kennedy.
under
your
first
point,
you
would
say
the
first
confession
in
this
case
is
also
admissible,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
we're
assuming
there
is.
i
mean--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--isn't
that
where
we
start?
at
least
for
purposes
of
decision
we
assume
violation,
don't
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you're
right
on
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there's
not...
then
we
didn't
really
need
to
take
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why?
under
your
first
argument--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--there
was
probable
cause
and
they
got
miranda
warnings.
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know.
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
logical...
a
logical
conclusion--
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
maybe
you're
right,
but
i
don't
know
why
you'd
differentiate
between
the
first
and
the
second
confessions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
just
stop
you
on
this.
don't
you
have
to
assume
that
a
police
officer's
version
of
the
arrest,
rather
than
the
defendant's
version,
in
order
to
reach
that
conclusion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
were
there
findings
that
they
told
the
truth
and
he
was
lying--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--when
he
said
they
barged
into
the
apartment
with
their
guns
drawn?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
not...
that's
not
with
regard
to
how...
what
the
behavior
was
at
the
time
they
entered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
why
they
had
their
guns
drawn.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
even
if
they
had
them
unholstered
and
concealed,
they
weren't
entirely
convinced
that
they
would
be
welcome,
were
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
again,
that's...
that's
if
you
accept
the
police
officer's
testimony.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
i
read
over
the
trial...
what
the
trial
court
said,
he
really
was
concentrating
on
the
second
confession,
not
what
went
on
at
the
time
of
the...
the
entry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
also
it's
also
clear
that
all
the
courts
in
the
new
york
system
agreed
that
the
entry
was
not
consensual.
so,
i
think
that
means
we
have
to
accept
at
least
some
degree
of
credibility
to
the
other
side's
version
of
the
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
it
depends
on
what
one
means
by
the
word
flagrant.
if
there
is
a
deliberate
policy
to
violate
the
constitution
in
order
to
avoid
the
effect
of
a
new
york
rule
that
would
make
it
improper
to
interrogate
the
person,
one
might
say
that's
flagrant
too--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
of
new
york
practice?
as
i
understand
it,
if
they
had
gotten
a
warrant,
that
would
be
an
accusatory
instrument
which
would
have
required
the
appointment
of
counsel
and
precluded
questioning
until
the
lawyer
was
appointed.
but
without
going...
without
getting
a
warrant...
say,
they
just
picked
up
a
man
on
the
street
on
probable
cause...
would
they...
would
that
same
prohibition
against
questioning
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--at
what
point
in
the
process
would
there
have
been...
would
it
have
been
necessary
as
a
matter
of
new
york
law
to
file
something
that
would
have
terminated
their
ability
to
go
ahead
and
question
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
until
they
either
get
an
arrest
warrant
or
some
kind
of
a
formal
complaint
is
filed
leading
to
an
arraignment
they
could
go
ahead
and
question
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
parker,
can
i
ask
you...
are
you
through
+/?
another
question
about
new
york
law
that
i'm
just
not
entirely
clear
on?
this
rule
about
the
accusatory
instrument
makes
it
impermissible
to
question
the
suspect
without
a
lawyer
until
a
lawyer
is...
and
he
can't
waive
that
right
except
in
the
presence
of
a
lawyer
which,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
holding
in
your
samuels
case
in
1980.
was
that
the
law
prior
to
samuels?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
this
an
old
new
york
rule
or
is
this
kind
of
a
by-product
of
payton
is
what
i'm
really
asking,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
