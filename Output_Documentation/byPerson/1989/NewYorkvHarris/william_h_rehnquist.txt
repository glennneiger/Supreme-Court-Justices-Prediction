chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-1000,
new
york
v.
bernard
harris.
mr.
coddington.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
without
regard
to
any
other
factors?
what
i
mean
is
do
you
agree
with
what
i
think
is
the
solicitor
general's
position
in
his
brief
that
the
vice
of...
going
inside
the
house
in
this
case
to
arrest
the
person
was
that
you
might
have
seen
things
inside
the
house
that
could
be
used
as
evidence,
not
the
mission
to...
to
arrest
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and,
therefore,
so
long
as
you're
not
using
any
evidence
that
you
saw
inside
the
house
to
prove
your
case,
the
arrest
itself
is
okay?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
your
first
point
is
that
probable
cause
plus
miranda
warnings
attenuate
without
more?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
second
point
is
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
suggesting
there's
some
sort
of
halfway
house
between
consent
to
entry
and
a
violation
of
payton?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
found
there
was
no
consent,
didn't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--didn't
grant
certiorari
on
any...
on
any
question
like
that,
did
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you
might
be
well-advised
to
assume
that
we're
very
unlikely
to
relitigate
that
question
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
coddington.
mr.
parker,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
he...
can
you
tell
from
the
question
and
answer
whether
he
was
referring
to
search
warrants
or
arrest
warrants?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
police
here
would
have
been
no
better
off
with
an
arrest
warrant,
would
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
police
here
would
have
been
no
better
off
with
an
arrest
warrant
than
with
probable
cause,
would
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
that
interest
us,
what
the
new
york
constitution
imposes
on
the
new
york
state
police
officers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
saying
is
that
it
rules
out
other
possible
explanations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
the...
if
the
reasoning
behind
payton
is
that
the
wrong
there
is
the
entry
of
the
home
without
a
warrant,
why...
why
isn't
that
wrong
satisfactorily
compensated
for
or
protected
against
by
simply
excluding
whatever
the
police
might
have
seen
or
seized
when
they
came
into
the
home?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
they
can
get
that
by
arresting
him
on
the
street,
can't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if...
if
you're
trying
to
figure...
as
i
take
it
all
of
us
are
trying
to
figure
out
exactly
what
happened
here
and
why
it
happened,
it
seems
to
me
the
only...
the
most
logical
explanation
for
why
the
police
did
this
at
home
rather
than
on
the
street...
if
they
were
trying
to
pull
something
off...
was
to
get
inside
the
house
and
see
something.
that
they
could
do
inside
the
house,
and
they
couldn't
do
it
on
the
street.
they
could
talk
to
the
talk
to
the
fellow
on
the
street
just
as
they
could
inside
the
house.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
you...
yeah.
doesn't...
doesn't
it
mean
in
part
letting
the
defendant
get
back
to
normal
from
whatever
effect
the
wrongful
action
might
have
had
on
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
parker,
and
thank
you
for
serving
as
an
amicus
curiae
for
the
court
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
coddington,
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
coddington.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
five
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
