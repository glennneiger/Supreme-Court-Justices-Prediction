justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
there
hadn't
been
any
statement
taken
at
the...
in
the
house
at
all
but
there
was
an
entry
without
a
warrant,
without
an
arrest
warrant.
and
you
go
to
the
station
house,
give
him
the
miranda
warnings
and
then
you
get
a
statement.
would
you
be
here
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
say
it's
just
the
fact
that
there
was
an
illegal
entry
that's
coercive?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
need...
you
needn't
focus
on
the
statement
taken
at
the
house
at
all,
as
to
whether
it
might
contribute
to
the
coerciveness?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
question
is
whether...
i
suppose
in
general
whether
this
statement
at
the
station
house
was
a
product
of
the
arrest
in
the
house
without
a
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
well
isn't
that...
isn't
that
the
issue
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
would
you...
if
you
say
it
is
a
product
there
of
the
illegal
entry,
i
would
suppose
it
would
be
the
same
product
if
a
statement
was
taken
two
weeks
later.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but...
they
got
a
statement
in
the
house
and
they
got
one
at
the
station
house.
but
the
issue
is
the
one...
is
about
the
one
at
the
station
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
isn't
really
the
issue
where
you
say
there
is
a
payton
violation
and
whether
it's
a
product
of
a
policy
or
not.
justice
byron
r.
white
opinions
have
been
filed
with
the
clerk
explaining
the
actions
taken
in
the
following
five
cases.
