mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
january
16th,
1984
three
new
york
city
police
officers,
each
with
18
years
experience
on
the
force,
went
to
bernard
harris'
home
both
to
question
him
and
to
arrest
him
in
connection
with
a
homicide
five
days
earlier.
five
days
earlier,
on
the
11th,
the
police
officers,
specifically
detective
rivers
who
was
in
charge
of
the
investigation,
had
probable
cause
to
arrest
harris.
in
addition,
they
knew
on
that
day,
the
11th,
where
he
lived.
the
officers
were
apparently
not
concerned
that
harris
was
a
threat
to
anybody
else,
nor
were
they
concerned
that
he
might
flee
because
between
the
11th
and
the
16th,
insofar
as
the
record
shows,
they
made
no
effort
at
all
to
apprehend
him.
now,
the
specific
purpose
in
going
to
mr.
harris'
house
was
to
question
him.
both
officers
testified
to
that.
mccarthy
and
his
partner,
rivers.
both
of
these
were
16-year
detectives.
the
officers
did
not
have
a
warrant,
no
effort
had
been
made
to
obtain
a
warrant.
furthermore,
the
record
shows...
excuse
me...
the
record
does
not
suggest
that
the
arresting
officers
in
connection
with
their
efforts
to
arrest
mr.
harris
went
anywhere
other
than
to
his
house.
now,
obviously
the
police
officers
in
this
case
are
presumed
to
have
knowledge
of
and
be
bound
by
the
district
court's
decision
in
payton,
a
decision
which,
of
course,
in
the
first
instance
talked
directly
to
new
york
city
police
department.
in
addition,
there
is
a
memorandum
which
is
not
part
of
the
record
but
which
is
quoted
in
the
state's
reply
brief.
that
memorandum
apparently
was
circulated
to
all
police
department...
all
police
force
members
and
specifically
to
detectives
at
about
the
time
payton
was
decided.
so,
i
think
the
record
is
clear
that
these
officers
knew
what
payton
required.
so,
it
was
after
dark.
there
were
no
exigent
circumstances
at
all.
and
although
the
arrest
took
place
four
years
after
this
court's
decision,
detective
rivers,
the
18-year
veteran,
testified
that
it
was
not
the
custom
in
his
department
to
comply
with
what
this
court
said
the
fourth
amendment
required
in
payton.
he
was
asked
by
the
court
if
it
was
the
custom
in
his
department
to
get
warrants.
detective
rivers
said
no.
and
i
suggest
to
this
court
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
which
contradicts
or
qualifies
detective
rivers'
admission
about
the
existence
and
the
application
of
the
custom.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
the
questioning...
it
was
not
specific,
but
in
context
they
were
talking
about
arrest
warrants.
i
think
the...
there
are
several
important
things
about--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
they
would
have
been...
they
would
have
been
better
off...
they
could
have
lawfully
arrested
him
at
home
with
an
arrest
warrant.
a
simple...
simple
probable
cause
would
not
have
done
that.
i
think
one
of
the
ironies
of
this
case
is
that
the
petitioner
could
have
been
arrested
anywhere
except
in
his
home.
the
police
made
no
effort
to
arrest
him
anywhere
except
in
his
home.
now,
rivers'
testimony
and--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
or
any
more
significant.
to
return
to--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
--i
think
this
court's
decisions
indicate
that
that's...
that's...
that
rule...
that
result
would
obtain,
your
honor.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
the...
it's
our
position
that
the
statement...
the
statement
given
later
at
the
station
house
must
be
suppressed
as
a
result
of
the
illegal
arrest
in
the
home
as
a
result
of
a
payton
violation.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
saying
that's
a
per
se
rule.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
all
of
the
facts.
it--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
--i'm
sorry,
i--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
--no,
no.
i'm
not
saying
that
a
statement
taken
at
the
home
is
necessarily
more
coercive
than
a
statement
taken
somewhere
else.
i
am
saying,
of
course,
that
a
statement
taken
at
the
home
or
a
statement
taken
as
a
result
of
a
payton
violation
becomes
inadmissible.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
i
think
in
those
circumstances
the...
the...
the
rule
that
applies
is
that
a
confession
obtained
through
custodial...
interrogation
after
an
illegal
arrest
should
be
suppressed
unless
the
state
shows
sufficient
attenuation.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
that's
the
brown
rule,
your
honor.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
and
it's--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that's
not
in
this
case.
i
believe
this
court
granted
certiorari
only
with
respect
to
the
station
house
statement.
but
there
obviously
are
circumstances
where
the...
a
statement
given
earlier
might
be
on
of
the
factors
considered
under
brown
that
made
the
second...
second
statement
less
attenuated.
but
i
don't
believe
that's
something
that
is
presented
for
this
court's
decision
here.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
two
things
about
that,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
i
do
not
adopt
and
i
do
not
believe
that
what
this
court
was
concerned
about
in
brown
and
dunaway
and
taylor
were
arrests
without
probable
cause.
i
believe
that
in
those
cases
what
the
court
wrestled
with
was
the
notion
of
how
best,
how
most
efficiently
to
deter
an
illegal
arrest.
arrests
can
be
illegal
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
they
can
be
illegal
because
there
is
no
probable
cause.
they
can
be
illegal
because
there
happens
to
be
no
warrant.
i
believe
that
there
is
no
good
policy
reason
to
focus
on
one
type
of
arrest
and
exclude
another
type
of
arrest
that
because
of
the
circumstances
might
be
more
flagrant.
what
you
have
in
the
usual
circumstance
of
no...
what
it
seems
to
me
complicates
the
cases
involving
arrests
without
probable
cause
is
this
court's
recognition
of
the
difficulties
police
officers
have
in
making
spontaneous
or
difficult
on-the-spot
judgments.
but
here
we
don't
have
that
situation.
this
case,
i
suggest,
is
far
more
flagrant
than
dunaway
or
brown.
it...
it,
i
would
suggest,
creates
a
substantially
more
compelling
justification
for
the
absence...
excuse
me,
for
the
application
of
an
exclusionary
rule
than
brown,
taylor
and
dunaway.
it
was
a
home
arrest.
they
knew
they
had
to
get
a
warrant.
the
policy
manual
told
them.
five
days,
no
effort
to
get
the
warrant.
they
could
have
arrested
him
anywhere.
they
intended
to
arrest
him
without
a
warrant.
the
officers
made
no
effort
to
look
for
him
anywhere
but
in
the
home.
and
as
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
found,
this
series
of
steps
by
the
police
was
intended
to
avoid
restrictions
on
interrogation...
custodial
investigation
imposed
by
the
new
york
state
constitution--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
--well,
i...
it...
i
think
it...
it
adds...
what
it
does,
simply,
your
honor,
is
it...
it...
i
think
it
makes
more
plausible
the
existence
of
the
custom.
it
indicates
why
that
custom
probably
arose,
and
why
it
is
plausible
to
assume
in
new
york...
to
assume,
as
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
new
york,
that
the
custom
was
followed.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
it
tends
to
rule
out--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
--other
possible
explanations.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
it
does
not
do
that,
your
honor,
because
in
many
instances
what
the
police
officers
are
likely
to
be
looking
for
when
they
go
to
make
a
payton...
to
make
an
arrest
is
not
simply
tangible
or
testimonial...
excuse
me...
is
not
simply
tangible
evidence,
but
they
go,
as
they
did
here,
to
try
to
get
some
sort
of
statement.
and
the
solicitor
general's
approach
to
the
problem
doesn't
address
that
concern.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
they
could
have
arrested
him
on
the
street.
no
question
about
that.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
but
they
chose
to...
but
it...
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
i...
i
cannot
really
fully
reconstruct
what
the
thinking
of
the
police
officers
was
here,
but
if
you
look
at
the
kind
of
information
they
had
when
they
went
to
his
house
and
what
may
have
been
missing,
i
think
it's...
what
it
looks
like
they,
as
we've
said,
had
probable
cause
but
may
not
have
had
enough
to
convict
this
man.
and
what
they
needed
was
a
statement.
and
maybe
after...
based
on
their
experience
they
thought
the
best
way,
the
easiest
way
to
get
the
statement
was
to
confront
him
at
home.
i...
i
don't
know.
i'm
speculating
about
that.
but
the
record
certainly
doesn't
definitively
answer
that.
but
if
you
assume
that
in
some
instances...
for
example,
in
this
instance...
the
police
wanted
to
get
a
statement,
then
they
would
not
be
deterred
from
payton
violations
by
the
solicitor
general's
rule.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
they
could
have
arrested
him
on
the
street
without
a
warrant.
the
accusatory
instrument
would
not
have
had
to
have
been
filed
on
the--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
--excuse
me.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
believe
he
would
have
been
arrested,
he
would
have
been
arraigned,
and
at
arraignment...
or
shortly
after
arraignment
some
kind
of
information,
a
felony
complaint
or
a
misdemeanor
complaint--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
--would
have
had
to
have
been
filed
and
at
that
point,
at
arraignment,
the
right
to
counsel
would
have
attached.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the...
the
really
principal
difference
that
separates
the
prosecutor's
and
our
position
is
whether
a
brown
attenuation
analysis
really
applies
in
these
circumstances.
it's
our
argument
that
it
certainly
does
because
if
the
primarily
rule
of
the...
primary
thrust
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
going
to
be
deterrence,
stopping
a...
not
applying
it
to
a...
not
applying
to
a
situation
here
where
you
have
an
arrest
that
is...
has
been
found
to
be
purposefully
flagrant
is
not
going
to...
is...
is
not
going
to
deter
police
or
eliminate
this
custom.
in
view
of
the
court's
position
on
consent,
i
will
not
address
that.
i
believe
i've
covered
most
of
the...
covered
the
main
points
i
have.
i
will...
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
will
surrender
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i
think
the
object
of
the
exclusion
in
brown
is
to
eliminate
the
incentive
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
brown
wrestled...
in
addition
to
wrestling
with
the
issue
of
how
miranda
warnings
fit
in
there,
also
following
wong
sun
and
the
older
cases,
wrestled
with
the...
a
notion
of
where
you
draw
the
line
following
an
illegal
event
in
order
to
bring
about
deterrence.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
i'm
not
sure...
i'm
not
sure
i
could
think
of
a
better
term.
it's
a...
it's
a
shorthand
that
we're
all
familiar
with.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
it
means
that
in
part,
i
believe,
and
that's
why
it
looks
to
the
temporal
factors.
but
it...
it's
complicated
because
i
believe
this
court's
opinions
have
now
indicated
that
as
far...
insofar
as
attenuation
analysis
is
concerned
the
most
important
factor
is
the
flagrancy
of
the
police
misconduct.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
it's
a
fourth
amendment
principle.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
i...
i
realize
that
the...
that
there
are
gray
areas
around
these
principles,
but
i
think
that
in
terms
of
setting
doctrine
that
courts
can
apply
and
have
now
experience
with
applying
and
are
comfortable
with
applying,
the
attenuation
analysis
seems
to
be
working.
there
is
no
indication
here,
in
the
record
here...
in
this
case
that
it's
not.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
well,
i
believe
under
this
court's
controlling
doctrine
that
burden--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
--yes,
i
would
agree.
yes.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
but
it--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
--well,
that's
a
factual
question
certainly.
but--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
--but
there
it
might
be...
there
might
be
other
intervening
factors.
and,
of
course,
they'd
begin
to
implicate
fifth
amendment
concerns.
but
here,
of
course,
the
police
went
to
harris'
house
for
the
purpose
of
getting
a
statement
and...
and
they
got
a
statement.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
oh,
i--
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
--now,
i
believe
this
body
of
law
existed
before
payton.
it
went
back
to
some
decisions
in
i
believe
the
mid
to
early
'60s.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
and,
of
course,
when
payton
came
along
the
body
of
law
imposing
the
restrictions
was
suddenly
confronted
with
this
new
element,
this
requirement
that
this
court
set
in
payton.
i
think
what
is
significant
there
is
that
following
payton
the
legislature
was
asked
to
reconsider
the
requirement
of
accusatory
instrument
filing
as
a
predicate
to
an
arrest
warrant.
and
the
argument
was
made
that
some
difficulties
might
be
created...
some
difficulties
had
been
created
because
of
this
court's
payton
decision,
and
the
legislature
rejected
it.
so
here
we
have
a
case
where
the
new
york
legislature...
it's
not...
of
course,
the
legislative
history
is
not
as
complete
as
you
would
have
for
a
congressional
action.
but
there
is
some
indication
that
the
legislature
in
new
york
was
aware
of
this
position...
aware
of
this
situation
and
did
not
change...
did
not
change
the
law
having
been
advised
of
these
concerns.
mr.
barrington
d.
parker,
jr.
thank
you.
