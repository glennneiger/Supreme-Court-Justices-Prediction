justice
thurgood
marshall
did
the
police
have
the
drawn
guns
when
they
went
in
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
was
consensual?
do
you
think
that
to
admit
somebody
with
a
gun
is
consensual?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then
he
was
in.
then
he
could
do
whatever
he
wanted
to
do.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
do
you
do
with
a
man
with
a
gun?
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
you...
you
would
shut
a
door
with
a
man
with
a
gun?
justice
thurgood
marshall
try
it
sometime.
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
won't
be
around
to
talk
about
it.
[laughter]
justice
thurgood
marshall
but,
i
mean,
this
rule
in
new
york
to
me
is
not
proper
under
the
constitution.
that
you
don't
get
a
warrant
of
arrest.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
nothing.
there
were
five
days--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--and
there
was...
there
was
no
reason
at
all
except
the
rule.
justice
thurgood
marshall
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
of
appeals
did...
said
that
payton
applied,
didn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
agree
that
payton
applied?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
wonder
why
we're
sitting
her
for.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
wonder
what's
up
left.
once
you
agree
on
payton,
aren't
you
in
trouble?
justice
thurgood
marshall
xxx
new
york
ever
approved
this
rule
of
the
police
department
that
you
did
not
need
a
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
only
saw
one
case.
is
that
the
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
rule
is
a
rule
of
the
police
department,
not
the
new
york
courts.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
this
opinion
says
that.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
does
the
policy
of
the
new
york
police
department
have
on
us?
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
we
bound
by
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
this
is
not
state
law
we're
talking
about.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
is
the
police
department
of
a
city's
law.
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
are...
aren't
they
different?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--police
procedure
is
wrong.
yeah.
justice
thurgood
marshall
xxx
flagrant
and
violations
of
my
constitution.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
would
have
made
it
flagrant?
for
them
to
have
cursed
him
or
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
they'd
hit
him
in
the
head
with
a
blackjack,
would
that
have
been
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
that...
well,
what...
what
below
that
is
flagrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
guess
shooting
him
would
be
flagrant
too,
wouldn't
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
are
we
obliged
to
find
what
is
flagrant
in
this
circumstance?
because
the
city
of
new
york...
i
mean,
the
state
of
new
york
in
its
opinion
has
already
said
it
was
a
violation.
they
didn't
need
to
say
flagrant,
i
didn't
think.
they
said
it
was
a
violation.
justice
thurgood
marshall
now,
why
can't
we
say
the
same
thing?
