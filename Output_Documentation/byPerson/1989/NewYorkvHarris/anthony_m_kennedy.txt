well,
but
just...
but
just
on
the
first
point,
to
follow-up
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
if
you
assume
that
the
rule
is
you
must
exclude
the
statement
that's
given
in
the
house,
then
do
you
make
the
same
argument
here?
or
is
it
just
a
factual
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
not
there's...
the
taint's
been
attenuated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
don't
need
to
argue
anything
else.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
know,
there
is
no
consensual
entry
even
if
you
just
walk
up
to
the...
knock
on
the
door
and
show
your
badge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but...
but
that
is
the
point...
that
is
the
point
of
your
case,
isn't
it?
because
i...
i
take
it
you
would
concede...
maybe
you
wouldn't...
i
take
it
you
would
concede
if
there
is
an
arrest
outside
and
the
warrant
is
somehow
defective,
that
the
statement
is
nevertheless
admissible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
it
is
the
fact
that
he
was
arrested
in
violation
of
payton
in
his
home
that
establishes
the
invalidity
that
you
must
rely
on
here,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
why
is
it
that
a
statement
taken
at
home
is
deemed
to
be
more
coercive
than
a
statement
taken
someplace
else?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're...
you're
not
saying
it's
a
per
se
rule--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
a...
that
a
statement
taken
at
home
in
violation
of
payton
is...
is
inadmissible?
