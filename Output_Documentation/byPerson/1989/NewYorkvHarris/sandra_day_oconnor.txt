well,
mr.
coddington,
is
it
the
policy
then
in
new
york
that
arrests
are
made
without
warrants
to
avoid
that
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
certainly
is...
is
the
argument
made
in
part
by
the
other
side.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that's
the
custom
or
practice
in
any
agencies
in
new
york?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
to
make
an
arrest
without
a
warrant
in
a
home
certainly
violates
the
constitution,
does
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
you...
you
concede
that
the
arrest
without
a
warrant
was
unlawful
inside
the
house?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
payton
was
articulating
a
constitutional
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
would
agree
there
was
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
payton
was
determined
only
because
the
door
was
broken
in?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you
think
that
makes
the
person
arrested
somehow
more
likely
to
confess
than
if
he
were
arrested
outside
his
home?
is
there
something
about
that
fact
that
enhances
the
exploitation
of
that
illegality?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
any
more
significant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
any
more
significant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
that's
the
brown--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--v.
illinois
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
solicitor
general
in
a
brief
filed
in
this
case
suggests
that
we
shouldn't...
we
should
limit
brown
v.
illinois
and
its
rules
on
attenuation
to
circumstances
of
arrests
without
probable
cause.
