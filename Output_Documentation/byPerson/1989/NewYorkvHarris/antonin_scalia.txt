well,
you
might...
you
might
consider
that
confession
to
be
evidence
seized
in
the
house.
justice

mr.
parker,
maybe...
maybe
you
can
explain
to
me
what
i
really
don't
understand.
what...
what
is
attenuated
under
brown?
i...
i...
if
the
object
of
excluding
the
confession
was
to
exclude
something
that
has
been
coerced,
i
could
understand
that
you
would
look
for
attenuation
of
coercive
impact.
but
that's
not
the...
that's
not
the...
the
object
of
the
exclusion,
as
i
understand
it,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
the
most
significant
factors
are
how
flagrant
was
the...
was
the
event
which
ought
to
be
sanctioned
by
the
exclusion
and...
it's
just
sort
of
strange
to
refer
to
that
as
attenuation.
i...
i...
that's...
that's
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
haven't
we
said
that
it's
not
a
fifth
amendment
principle?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
fourth
amendment
principle
so
really
what
we're
looking
to
is
not
how
coerced
was
the
confession.
and
that's
what
gives
me
the
difficulty
in...
in
conceptualizing
it
as
attenuation.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure
you
would
agree?
i
think
that
makes
it
a
fifth
amendment
principle.
i
think
when
you
say
a
fourth
amendment
principle,
you--
