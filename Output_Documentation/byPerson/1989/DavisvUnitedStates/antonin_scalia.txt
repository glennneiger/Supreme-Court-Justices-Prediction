justice
scalia
mr.
lee,
could
i
come
back
to
your,
as
i
understand
your
position
it
is
that
the
motive
doesn't
matter,
it
is
just
whether
the
primary
effect
is
to...
is
for
the
benefit
of
the
church?
justice
scalia
well,
then
that
would
mean
that
if
i...
if
i
am
walking
along
the
street,
and
i'm
a
compulsive
benefactor,
and
i
meet
a
young
man
that
i
take
a
liking
to
and
i
say
here,
young
man,
here
is
$5,000,
and
that
young
man
turns
out
to
be
a
mormon
missionary
and
he
uses
that
to
live
for
the
next
year
as
a
missionary,
then
i
have
a
deduction?
justice
scalia
well,
but
the
primary
effect
would
be
to
support
the
missionary
work
of
the
church.
justice
scalia
why
wouldn't
he
take
it
and
give
the
church
back
the
$5,000
that
he
is
using?
justice
scalia
and
if
he
does
that,
then
i
would
have
a
tax
deduction,
even
though
i
don't
even
know
he
is
a
mormon
missionary.
i
gave
him
$5,000--
justice
scalia
--and
he
writes
back
to
the
church
and
he
says
you
know,
this
fellow
gave
me
$5,000.
here
is
the
money
for
my
missionary
support,
i
am
going
to
use
this
other
money.
and
i
have
a
tax
deduction,
even
though
i
had
no
idea
the
person
was
even
a
mormon.
justice
scalia
no,
you
have
to
take
my
hypothetical.
he
doesn't
do
that.
justice
scalia
you
are
not
taking
my
hypothetical.
he
doesn't
do
that.
he
accepts
the
money,
he
sends
back
to
the
mormon
church
the
money
that
his
parents
have
given
him,
and
he
says
here,
somebody
else
has
given
me
money.
justice
scalia
and
you
really
think
that
i
would
have
a
deduction,
even
though
i
had
no
motivation
to
help
the
mormon
church
at
all?
justice
scalia
okay,
so
motive
has
to
enter
into
it
somehow,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
not
a
seminary
student?
justice
scalia
it
advances
their
spiritual
interest,
surely,
right?
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--and
their
parents
can
say
i
am
doing
this
because
i
think
it
will
do
my,
my
son
spiritual
good.
it
reminds
me
of
a
case
we
had
earlier
this
term
that
involved
donations
to
a
church
in
exchange
for
spiritual
benefits.
it's
sort
of
the
same
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
mr.
lee,
do
we
know
from
the
record,
as
i
recall
these
funds
were
sent
to
the
locations
where
these
students
were
proselytizing
and
deposited
in
a
bank
account
in
their--
justice
scalia
--do
we
know
from
the
record
what
would
have
happened
if
the
children
had
just
taken
off,
what
would
have
happened
to
the
bank
account?
would
it
have
gone
to
the
church?
justice
scalia
do
we
know
that
from
the
record?
justice
scalia
mr.
lee,
just
on
your
last
point,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
relevance
of
that.
suppose
some...
that
is
to
say
that
the
parents
would
not
have
out
of
material
motivations
done
this,
but
it
might
have
been
spiritual
motivation
for
their
children.
i
mean,
i
can't
take
a
deduction,
i
assume,
if
i
want
to
send
my
son
off
to
a
monastery
to
think
about
his
soul
for...
for...
for
several
months,
can
i?
justice
scalia
or
can
i?
justice
scalia
i
cannot;
i
assume
i
cannot.
i
mean,
suppose
i
pay
his,
you
know,
his
living
expenses
so
he
can
go
think--
justice
scalia
--think
about
the
permanent
things.
justice
scalia
the
missionary
aspect
of
this
is
central
to
the
whole
case,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
say
that,
ms.
peterson.
it
says
"to
or
for
the
use
of.
"
i
can
give
it
for
the
use
of
someone
without
giving
it
to
that
person.
justice
scalia
that
must
mean
that
i
can
give
it
to
somebody
else,
so
long
as
it
is
used
for
that
organization.
justice
scalia
well,
that
might
have
been
the
immediate
purpose,
but
its
language
goes
beyond
that.
it
is
common
that
congress
has
a
particular
problem
in
mind,
but
adopts
language
that
solves
that
problem
and
has
other
effects
as
well.
the
assertion
here
is
made
that
this
is
for
the
use
of
the
church,
and
that
the
funds
would...
would
even
have
to
be
returned
to
the
church
if
the,
if
the
children
didn't
use
them
for
the
purpose
designated.
justice
scalia
but
that
is
not
the
case,
you
say,
when
i
give
it
to
a
trustee.
justice
scalia
i
can
give
it
to
a
trustee
who
is
not
at
all
a
charitable
person.
he
may
be
a
very
commercial
person.
justice
scalia
but
that
is
what
the
church
asserts
is
the
case
here.
that
these
individuals
had
to
use
the
funds
in
the
work
of
the
church.
justice
scalia
well,
you
can
read
that
case.
i
mean,
i...
that
case
is,
it
depends
on
whom
you
consider
the
beneficiary.
if
it
is
a
student
in
a
secular
college,
you
have
to
give
the
money
to
the
college
unrestricted.
you
can't
designate
it
for
a
certain
student,
because
that
student
would
be
the
beneficiary.
the
church's
argument
here
is
that
the
beneficiary
of
this
expenditure
is
not
the,
is
not
the
son
who
got
the
money,
but
the
people
to
whom
he
is
preaching.
and
all
our
earlier
cases
can
certainly
be
reconciled
with
this
on
that
theory,
can't
they?
justice
scalia
well,
may
i
ask
about--
justice
scalia
--about
control.
you,
when
you
say
somehow
the
paradigm
case
for
this
provision
of
the
statute
you
say
is
a
trust,
like
a
community
trust,
which...
which
holds
the
money
and
then
distributes
it
to
various
charities.
does
any
one
of
the
charities
that
get
those
monies
control
the
trustee?
justice
scalia
the
church
asserts
that
here.
justice
scalia
but
insofar
as
control
is
concerned,
it
is
no
different
from
here,
if
you
assume...
if
you
assume
that
the
church
would
have
the
right
to
those
funds
if
the
child
abandoned
missionary
activity.
justice
scalia
now,
if
the
church
spent
money
to
support
these
individuals
while
they
are
on
mission
work,
you
would
not
say
that
that
money
was
being
spent
for
the
benefit
of
those
individuals.
you
would
say
the
money
was
being
spent
for
the
benefit
of
those
whom
they
are
proselytizing.
justice
scalia
but
if
the
parents,
if
the
same
thing
happens
and
the
money
comes
from
somebody
else,
you
suddenly
say
that
it
is
being
spent
for
the
benefit
of
those
individuals
and
not
for
the
benefit
of
the
persons
that
they
are
proselytizing.
why
is
that?
justice
scalia
how
can
it
be
for
their
benefit
when
the
parents
pay
it,
but
it's
not
for
their
benefit
when
it
comes
from
the
church?
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--you
probably
should
have
that
covered
by
statute.
that
does
sound
like
a
real
problem.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
ms.
peterson,
suppose
you
have
a...
a...
small
church,
a
small
catholic
church,
only
one
priest
there.
and
i
write
out
a
check,
you
know,
st.
mary's
church,
and
put
it
in
the
basket.
all
the
funds
are
kept
in
a
bank
account
by
the
only
priest
in
the
church.
would
i
be
able
to
deduct
that?
justice
scalia
under
your
theory.
justice
scalia
why
is
that
different
from
justice
stevens's
hypothetical,
where
you
write
a
check
to
the
missionary
as
trustee
for
the
mormon
church?
justice
scalia
i
see.
so
it
would
hinge
upon
whether
that
money
could
be
taken
out
of
st.
mary's
and
sent
to
other
parishes.
justice
scalia
what
language
do
you
rely
on
for
that?
