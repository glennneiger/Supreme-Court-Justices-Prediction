chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
89-98,
harold
davis
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
that
the
record
must
be
viewed
in
the
light
most
favorable
but
the
petitioners,
you
just
mean
any
factual
evidence
that
could
have
been
drawn?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lee,
supposing
that...
then,
i
am
not
saying
the
record
does
show
this,
supposing
it
had
showed
that
for
20
years
before
their
children
became
missionaries
the
petitioners
gave
$500
a
year
to
the
church,
and
then
in
the
years
when
their
children
were
missionaries
they
gave
$3,000
or
$4,000
a
year
to
the
church,
or
to
their
children,
and
claimed
a
religious
deduction.
then
when
their
children
ceased
to
be
missionaries
they
went
back
to
giving
$500
a
year
to
the
church.
now,
does
that
make
any
difference
in
your
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
my
hypothetical
though,
they
give
a
lot
more
when
their
children
are
involved
than
when
they
are
not.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
point
that
at
the
age
these
children
were
the
parents
might
well
have
been
supporting
them,
even
had
there
been,
had
they
been
doing
something
else?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
evidence
in
the
record
shows
that
this
was
a
fiduciary
relationship,
and
that
the
money
would
have
gone
to
the
church
had
the
children
simply
run
off?
chief
justice
rehnquist
whose
affidavit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
whose
affidavit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
we
don't
ordinarily
consider--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--appendices
to
amicus
briefs
as
part
of
the
record.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
part
of
the
record
in
this
case
shows
what
you
want
to
show?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
where
is
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
appendix
to
the
petition.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lee,
when
you
resume
i
would
appreciate
your
pointing
out
the
paragraph
in
the
backman
affidavit
pertinent
to
our
previous
discussion.
ms.
peterson,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
maybe--
--i
take
it
if...
if
my
child
were,
say,
a
methodist
missionary
in
china,
i
could
not
send
a
donation
to
my
child
as
a
methodist
missionary
and
say
do
this,
spend
this
money
to
support
yourself
while
you
are
preaching
the
gospel.
that
would
not
qualify
because
it
is
directed
to
a
particular
individual?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
don't
you
read
the
next
sentence
too.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
peterson.
mr.
lee.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
can
certainly
shift
small
amounts.
it
wouldn't
do
you
as
much
good.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
i
don't
think
it
was
a
question.
your
time
has
expired.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
