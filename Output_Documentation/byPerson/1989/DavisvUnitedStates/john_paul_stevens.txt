justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
you
say
the
money
belonged
to
the
church?
justice
stevens
does
the
bank
account
show
that?
justice
stevens
i
am
sure
it
seldom
happens,
but
what
if
a
missionary
did
spend
the
money
going
to
the
theater?
how
is
it
policed?
is
it,
do
you
rely
entirely
on
the
moral
commitment
of
the
missionary?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
this?
justice
stevens
supposing
that
they
modified
their
arrangement
in
this
respect,
and
said
that
the
parent
shall
send
the
money
in
the
form
of
a
check
payable
to
x
as
trustee
for
the
mormon
church.
and
they
open
a
bank
account
in
so,
in
his
name
as
trustee
for
the
mormon
church.
and
the
mormon
church
writes
them
a
letter
saying
you
are
our
trustee,
and
you
may
spend
the
money
for
the
following
missionary
purposes,
including
buying
food
and
sustenance
for
yourself,
but
no
other
purpose.
and
it
is
clear
that
it
is
a
trust
account.
would
the
case
be
different?
justice
stevens
your
answer
is
that
would
be
the
same
case.
justice
stevens
that
would
be
the
same
case,
even
though
the
church
would
then
have
a
legal
cause
of
action
for
misspent
funds?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
again,
the
problem
of
identifying...
you
are
looking
at
checks,
if
you
use
my
hypothetical
and
they
wrote
checks
payable
to
x
as
trustee
for
the
mormon
church,
you
wouldn't
have
any
trouble
identifying
those
checks.
justice
stevens
but
there
isn't
even
arguably
a
second
beneficiary
there.
justice
stevens
there
isn't
even
arguably
a
second
beneficiary
there.
here
at
least
it
is
arguable
that
the
people
that
the
missionary
contacts
when
he
is
proselyting
are
the
beneficiaries.
