ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
does
not
concern
the
admittedly
noble
purposes
of
the
mormon
church
or
its
missionary
program.
the
only
issue
before
the
court
today
is
a
question
of
statutory
construction
arising
under
section
170
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
namely,
whether
payments
made
by
taxpayers
directly
to
their
children
are
deductible
as
charitable
contributions
to
or
for
the
use
of
the
mormon
church.
we
believe
the
answer
to
that
question
is
clearly
no.
congress
has
provided
a
mechanism
in
the
statute
for
distinguishing
between
public
and
private
charity.
specifically,
congress
has
required
that
the
recipient
of
deductible
gifts
be
a
qualified
donee.
that
is
an
organization
which
meets
the
requirements
set
forth
in
the
statute.
the
only
way
to
ensure
that
a
gift
is
for
the
public
benefit
and
that
the
statute
can
be
reasonably
administered
and
enforced,
is
to
require
that
all
contributions
for
which
deductions
are
granted
under
section
170
be
subject
to
the
discretion
of
a
qualified
donee.
that
is
what
the
statute
requires--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--justice
o'connor,
if
the
parents
made
the
contributions
to
the
church,
and
the
church
had
complete,
unfettered
control
over
the
use
of
those
funds
in
its
general
missionary
program,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
contribution
would
be
deductible.
however,
if
the
contribution
were
given
to
the
church
with
the
express
understanding
or
limitation
that
the
funds
could
be
used
only
to
support
these
particular
missionaries,
the
contributions
would
not
be
deductible.
the
government
reads
the
winn
case
and
the
peace
case
quite
differently
from
the
manner
in
which
mr.
lee
has
described
it
to
you.
in
the
peace
case,
the
court
there
determined
that
the
contributions
were
made
to
the
control
of
the
mission
generally,
and
for
that
reason
the
contributions
were
found
deductible.
and
those
that
were
made
to
individual
missionaries
were
found
not
deductible
in
the
peace
case.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
that
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
the
missionary
was
away
from
home.
the
question
that
you
are
asking,
justice
o'connor,
is
whether
or
not
the
amounts,
had
the
contribution
deduction
been
claimed
by
petitioners'
sons,
whether
or
not
those
amounts
would
be
deductible
under
regulation
(g)
as
an
unreimbursed
expense.
it
would
be
deductible,
if
at
all,
only
by
petitioners'
sons,
but
it
is
the
government's
position
that
they
would
not...
those
expenses
that
were
incurred
for
meals
and
lodging
would
not
be
deductible
because
these
young
men
were
not
away
from
home
for
tax
purposes
at
the
time
that
the
expenses
were
incurred.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
that
is
correct.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
when
congress
established
the
mechanism
for
determining
deductibility
under
section
170,
it
relied
on
the
mechanism
of
a
qualified
donee.
those
are
organizations
which
by
their
charter
are
limited
to
expending
funds
for
certain
purposes
that
have
been
determined
in
advance
to
be
charitable.
and
it
is
by
placing
control
in
the
hands
of
such
qualified
donees
that
the
statute's
purpose
can
be
achieved.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
justice
scalia--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--justice
scalia,
1921
for
the
express
purpose
of
permitting
deductions
to
trusts
or
other
intermediary
entities
that
served
as
fiduciaries
having
a
legal
obligation
to
hold
and
administer
the
funds
for
ultimate
distribution
to
charity.
congress
viewed
the
insertion
of
those
words
as
a
minor
change
in
the
statute.
congress--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--justice
scalia,
the
entire
thrust
of
section
170
requires
that
the
gift
be
for
a
public
benefit.
the
control
requirement
in
the
qualified
donee
is
inherent
in
the
basic
definition
of
charitable
contribution.
it
is
only
the
unfettered
control
in
the
charitable
donee
which...
it's
the
hallmark
of
a
charitable
contribution
because
it
ensures
that
element
of
indefiniteness
of
beneficiary,
which
is
essential
to
having
the
contribution
be
deemed
charitable.
and
with
respect
to
your...
going
back
to
your--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--the
trustee--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--the
trustee,
though,
has
a
legal
obligation
to
hold
and
administer
the
funds
for
the
benefit
of
charity
and
for
ultimate
distribution
to
charity,
justice
scalia.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
justice
scalia,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
this
case
that
i
am
aware
of
to
indicate
that
these
young
men
were
fiduciaries
of
the
church.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
undisputed,
and
contrary
to
mr.
lee's
invitation
to
remand,
i
would
just
point
out
that
the...
the
facts
are
absolutely
not
in
dispute
here.
it
is
the
taxpayer
who
petitioned
for
certiorari
and
who
now
suggests
that
there
are
factual
issues
that
might
require
remand.
the
facts
here
are
very
clear.
the
parents
made
a
direct
deposit
into
their
children's
bank
accounts.
the
children
were
the
sole
signatories
on
those
bank
accounts.
the
children
determined
how
they
would
use
the
funds.
they
determined
how
they
would
spend
it,
on
food,
housing,
whatever.
had
they
used
the
funds
for
some
non-charitable
purpose,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
the
only
result
would
have
been...
or
could
have
been,
that
the
mission
might
have
been
terminated
and
the
child
might
have
sent...
been
sent
home.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
the
record
in
the
case
indicates
that
the
children
were
the
sole
signatories
over
the
accounts,
and
the
church
indicates
that
its
control
consisted
of
reviewing
the
expenditures,
the
total
expenditures,
not
even
the
itemized
expenditures,
but
the
total
expenditures
that
the
children
made,
after
the
fact.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
if,
if
the
church
had
received
the
funds--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--if
the
church
had
legal
control
over
the
funds,
yes,
then
that
would
be
a
contribution
to
the
church,
justice
kennedy,
and
would
be
deductible.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
well,
i
am
afraid
i
don't
understand
how
the
church
could
have
total
control
over
the
funds
if
the
payment
is
to
the
missionary.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
if
in
fact
a
relationship
was
established
under
which--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--if
the
agent
is
in
fact
an
agent
for
the
church--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--the
agency...
the
establishment
of
an
agency
relationship,
it
seems
to
me,
justice
kennedy,
requires
a
contract
between
two
parties,
which,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
has
not
been
established
by
the
record
in
this
case,
except
that--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--the
record
in
this
case
will
indicate
that
the
mormon
church
prefers
that
its
missionaries
not
receive
contributions
from
any
party
except
their
parents.
to
the
extent
that
they
are
agents
of
the
church,
they
are
agents
only
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
money
from
their
parents
to
spend
on
their
own
support.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
there
is
no
question
that
non-parents
occasionally
support
missionaries,
justice
white,
but
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
the
church
does
not
want
its
missionaries
to
receive
funds
directly
from
third
parties.
that
is
part
of
the
affidavit
that
is
in
the
record
in
this
case.
the
only
person
from
whom
these
children...
from
whom
these
children
are
authorized
to
receive
funds
on
behalf
of
the
church
is
their
parents.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
justice
white,
they--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--i
think
not.
they
used
the
money
to
support
themselves.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
they
used
it
to
purchase
food--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--they
used
it
to
purchase
housing.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
yes,
but
they
had
to
eat,
and
they
had
to
have
housing.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
and
as,
as
the
court
in
the
orr
case
said,
the
words
"to
or
for
the
use
of.
"
cannot
be
stretched
to
cover
payments
that
the
taxpayers
would
have
made
in
any
event.
and
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
earlier
questioning,
these
young
men
were
19
and
20
years
of
age.
it
is
likely
that
their
parents
would
have
supported
them
whether
or
not
they
were
serving
as
missionaries
for
the
church.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
justice
kennedy--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--i
don't
know
that
we
addressed
motive
in
great
detail,
but
motive
is
relevant
here
in
two
respects,
justice
kennedy.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
no,
and
i
will
address
that.
motive
is
relevant
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
has
been
a
contribution
or
gift.
that
question
is
not
before
the
court
here
this
morning,
but
it
certainly
would
be
very
relevant
if
this
case
were
remanded.
motive
is
also
relevant
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
gift
favors
a
particular
individual.
and
when
a
gift
favors
a
particular
individual,
as
we
believe
it
did
in
this
case,
it
lacks
the
indefiniteness
of
bounty
that
qualifies
it
as
a
charitable
deduction.
this
court
has
recognized--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--well,
since
at
least
1882
this
court
has
recognized--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--russell
v.
allen.
russell
v.
allen.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
yes.
this
court
has
recognized
that
indefiniteness
of
beneficiary
is
key
to
a
charitable
gift.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
that
is
right,
justice
rehnquist.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
justice
scalia,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
people
to
whom
these
boys
were
preaching
were
beneficiaries
of
the
missionary
program.
that's
not
the
issue
here.
the
issue
here,
to
the
extent
that
use
and
beneficiary
is
relevant,
is
who
is
the
beneficiary
of
these
funds
and
who
controlled
these
funds.
that
is
the
real
issue.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
did
a
qualified
donee
have
control.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
they
are...
the
trustee,
however...
well,
there
are
two
answers
to
your
question,
justice
scalia.
the
first
is
that
the
intermediary
trustee
who
is
holding
it
for
the
charity
has
a
legal
obligation...
a
case,
a
suit
could
be
brought
against
him
to
enforce
his
legal
obligation.
second
of
all--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--second
of
all,
that
trustee
will
ultimately
distribute
the
funds
to
the
charity.
congress
understood
the
words
"for
the
use
of"
to
mean
only
that
there
would
be
some
delay
in
the
distribution
to
charity.
they
did
not
mean
that
charity
would
never
receive
it.
when
congress
reenacted
this
section
of
the
statute
in
1954,
the
legislative
history,
and
again
in
1964,
the
legislative
history
makes
it
very
clear
that
congress
thought
that
the
use
of
the
words
"for
the
use
of"
meant
only
that
there
would
be
some
delay
in
the
transmission
of
the
funds
to
the
charity.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
let's
talk
about
that,
because
i
am
unable
to
find
anything
in
the
record
that
would
indicate
that
in
fact
the
funds
would
be
distributable
to
the
church
at
the
end
of
the
mission.
the
affidavit
to
which
mr.
lee
refers,
at
paragraph
22
on
page
33a,
says
surpluses
of
contributions
over
expenditures
are
not
contemplated
because
the
monthly
amount
requested
is
determined
by
the
mission
president
based
upon
conservative
estimates
of
actual
need.
i
am
not--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--furthermore,
if
a
surplus
starts
to
develop,
the
missionary
is
expected
to
take
action
to
have
the
amount
of
the
donation
sent
to
him
appropriately
reduced.
now,
if
there
is
something
in
the
record
i
am
not
aware
of
it--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--yes,
justice
stevens.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
if
the
beneficiaries
of
that
trust
are
determined
in
advance,
and
there
is
an
understanding
between
the
charity
and
the
donor
that
it...
in
fact,
the
funds
are
going
to
be
used
to
benefit
specific
individuals,
then
the
transfer
lacks
the
indefiniteness
which
is
the
hallmark
of
a
charitable
contribution.
it
would
not
be
deductible.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
it
would
not
be
deductible.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
that
is
correct,
because
any
transfer
that
will
qualify
for
a
contribution
deduction
under
170
must
be
indefinite
in
nature.
it
cannot
be
earmarked
for
the
specific
benefit
of
any
person.
and
i
would
like--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
because
that
is
what
the
statute
requires,
justice
scalia.
the
statute...
well,
let's
talk
about
this
for
just
a
moment.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
the
statute
doesn't
say
for
the
benefit
of.
the
statute
says
pay
the
contribution
to
or
for
the
use
of
a
qualified
donee.
can
you
imagine
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
administer
this
statute
if
checks
written
to
individuals
suddenly
became
subject
to
the
contribution
deduction
under
section
170?
the
internal
revenue
service
would
find
it
impossible
to
administer
the
statute.
not
only
would
it
be
necessary
to
audit
the
donor's
records,
it
would
also
be
necessary
to
audit
the
donee's
records
to
see
whether
or
not
the
payment
in
question
had
in
fact
been
used
for
a
public
purpose.
and
when
you
are
talking
about
missionaries
in
a
missionary
program,
we
could
have
the
missionary
in
tanzania
or
china,
or
wherever,
and
then
determining
whether
or
not
they
have
used
that
money
to
advance
the
public
benefit
would
be
impossible.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
we
believe
that
is
what
this
statute
does
provide.
and
i
would
just
emphasize
that
it
is
not
sufficient
simply
to
confer
a
benefit
on
the
charity.
private
charity,
private
donations,
no
matter
how
laudable,
no
matter
how
benevolent,
are
not
deductible.
congress
has
not
seen
fit
to
provide
for
deductions
for
individuals,
and
they
simply
are
not
deductible
unless
they
pass
to
a
qualified
donee.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
well,
yes,
justice
stevens,
but
that
then
goes
back
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
transfer
was
designed
to
benefit
a
particular
individual.
it
is
like...
that
could
be
analogous
to
the
tuition
case.
if
i
write
a
check
to
bryn
mawr
college
to
pay
my
daughter's
tuition,
it
doesn't
make
it
deductible
just--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--i
beg
your
pardon,
sir?
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
let
me
just
point
out
that
the
lower
court
cases
that
have
addressed
this
question
have
held
that
gifts
or
transfers
to
persons
who
are
serving
as
missionaries,
i.e.,
providers
of
services,
are
treated
in
the
same
way
as
those
for
receivers
of
services.
so
that
if...
just
because
someone
is
serving
as
a
missionary
and
is
providing
missionary
services,
the
money
still
cannot
be
earmarked
for
that
person,
or
it
is
not
deductible
under
section
170.
the
statute
is
set
up
to
ensure
that
the
money
passes
through
the
hands
of
a
qualified
donee.
that
is
the
only
way
that
we
can
ensure
that
the
public
benefit
is
advanced,
and
that
the
indefiniteness
of
beneficiary
is
ensured.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
i,
would...
i
am
sorry,
justice
white,
i
didn't--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--yes.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
uh-hum.
i
agree.
i
think
that
we
would,
we
would
continue
to
have
that
problem.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
yes.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
yes.
justice
white,
the
statutory
requirement
of
payment
has
been
interpreted
to
deny
a
deduction
where
there
is
no
payment
of
cash
or
property,
even
though
the
taxpayer's
action
may
confer
a
measurable
economic
benefit
on
the
charity.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
and
the
check
is
made
not
to
the
church,
but--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--but
to
individuals.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
i
would
have
to
say
that
in
that
event
they
have
not,
again
not
complied
with
the
statutory
requirement
of
having
the
money
passed
to
the
qualified
donee.
the
statute
sets
up
formalities
which
must
be
observed
if
we
are
going
to
be
able
to
administer
the
law.
in
fact--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--justice
scalia,
it
is
my
understanding--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--yes.
it
is
my
understanding
that
under
those
circumstances
the
priest
would
be
serving
as
a
fiduciary
for
the
catholic
church
for
all
purposes,
that
he
is
authorized
to
receive
funds,
to
hold
funds,
and
to
administer
funds
on
behalf
of
the
church
for
every
possible
purpose.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
i
understood
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
to
involve
earmarked
contributions
for
the
direct
benefit
of
certain
missionaries.
whereas
i
understood
your
question
to
relate
only
to
a
contribution
to
the
church's
general
program.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
no,
it
would
hinge
on
whether
or
not
the
priest
could
use
it
for
the
church's
general
program
within
st.
mary's
parish,
or
for
whatever
purpose,
but
not
for
a
specific
individual's
benefit.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
the
possibilities
of
abuse
that
may
arise
if
the
court
were
to
accept
the
taxpayers'
exceedingly
broad
reading
of
section
170.
first
of
all,
as
i
mentioned
before,
if
direct
payments
to
individuals
were
deductible,
the
service
would
be
required
to
scrutinize
how
the
funds
were
spent,
to
ensure
that
a
public
purpose
was
served.
moreover,
we
would
raise
the
risk
of
double
deductions.
and,
as
inadvertently
occurred
in
this
case,
the
problem
where
the
parents
claimed
initially
both
a
dependency
deduction
and
a
deduction
for
the
monies
that
were
contributed
for
the
missionary
service.
we
have
the
possibility
of
shifting
deductions
between
taxpayers,
and,
as
you
know,
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
the
tax
law
that
income
and
deductions
may
not
be
shifted
between
taxpayers.
and
absent
a
specific
statutory
exception,
such
as
for
medical
expenses
which
are
set
forth
in
section
213,
the
code
consistently
treats
individual
family
members
as
separate
taxpayers.
if
their
parents
had
paid
their
sons'
interest
expense
or
taxes
or
any
other
deductible
expense,
they
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
the
deduction.
and
this
case
is
no
different
from
that.
it
would
also
permit
the
anticipation
of
deductions,
because
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
the
year
in
which
the
expenditure
is
actually
made
would
be
the
same
as
the
year
in
which
the
payment
from
the
parent
to
the
child
is
made.
in
short,
we
believe
that
the
taxpayers'
reading
of
section
170
is
simply
not
justified
by
the
statutory
language.
it
is
not
what
congress
intended.
and
we
think
that
it
would
extend
it
far
beyond
what
congress
intended
and
would
make
the
administration
of
the
statute
almost
impossible--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--oh,
so
long
as
it
is
not
earmarked
for
a
specific
individual,
justice
white.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
but,
as
a
trustee--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--in
a
fiduciary
relationship.
clearly,
no...
that
would
be
deductible,
assuming
that--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--no,
because
then
he
has
earmarked
it
for
a
specific
individual.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
right.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
example
that
you
were
positing
is
in
effect
a
sham--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--i
may
have
understood
justice
stevens.
i
was,
i
understood
him
to
say
a
true
fiduciary
relationship,
but--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--where
the
beneficiary
of
the
funds
is
not
earmarked.
the
moment
you
have
earmarked
funds
to
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
a
specific--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--only
if
it
is
ultimately
distributable
to
the
charity.
the
charity
must
exercise
control
over
it,
justice
white,
that
is
the
only
way
that--
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
--it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
have
suggested
here
is
the
equivalent
of
the
sort
of
sham
transaction
that
existed
with
the
tuition
payments.
and
so
long
as
you
have
an
understanding
or
arrangement
between
the
donor
and
the
donee
that
specific
individuals
are
going
to
benefit
by
it,
then
the
church
does
not
have
the
unfettered
discretion
and
control
that
is
required.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
again,
if
it
is
earmarked
for
the
use
of
a
specific
individual,
it
ought
not
to
be
deductible.
that
is
not
what
congress
intended
when
it
enacted
section
170,
i
would
submit.
ms.
shirley
d.
peterson
the
legislative
history
of
section
170,
in
addition
to
this...
court
has
recognized
the
public
charity
aspect
and
the
public
benefit
aspect
of
section
170
repeatedly,
justice
scalia.
as
recently
as
bob
jones
university
this
court
said
public
benefit
permeates
section
170.
we
agree
with
that.
