justice
o'connor
mrs.
peterson,
do
you,
do
you
accept
the
proposition
that
if
contributions
were
made
by
the
parents
to
the
church
for
use
in
the
missionary
program,
that
those
are
deductible?
justice
o'connor
now,
if
the
taxpayer
making...
filing
the
return
was
the
missionary
himself,
i
assume
he
could
presumably
deduct
the
expenses
of
his
subsistence
while
serving
in
that
capacity?
