justice
white
well,
i
suppose
it's
common
ground
in
the
government
that
if,
if
in
the
chief
justice's
example
the
family
gave
$500
a
year
to
the
church
and
then
they
gave...
and
then
they
send
their
children
$5,000
a
year
or
whatever
the
amount
is...
i
suppose
it's
common
ground,
instead
of
sending
it
to
them,
they
gave
the
church
$5,000,
that
there
would
be
a
deduction.
justice
white
so
if
the
church
ran
its
missionary
support
program
differently,
took
the
money
itself
from
the
parents,
there
would
be
no
problem.
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
you
would
say
that...
that
even
if
the
parent
gave
to
the
church
some
money
and
earmarked
it
for
named
individuals
who
were
not
their
sons
or
daughters,
that
it
would
not
be
deductible
either?
justice
white
and
so,
a
fortiori,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
these
particular
people
involved
were
not
the
children
of
the
givers?
justice
white
well
now
that
isn't...
that
isn't...
that
can't
be
so.
you
say
that
it
is
not
the
practice
sometimes
for
non-parents
to
support
missionaries?
justice
white
well,
you
don't...
i
take
it
that
even
if
there
isn't
some
sort
of
a
formal
contract,
i
would
think
that
it's
perfectly
plain
that
the
children
on
the
missions
think
they
are
under
some
obligation
not
only
to
their
parents,
but
to
the
church,
to
spend
this
money
only
for
their
missionary
activities.
justice
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
white
you
think--
justice
white
--that
isn't
what
i
asked
you.
justice
white
do
you
think
they
feel
under
an
obligation
to
spend
it
for...
to
support
themselves
so
that
they
can
be
missionaries?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
of
course.
justice
white
i
suppose
you
would
have
the
same...
have
the
same...
take
the
same
position
if
some,
if
some
member
of
the
mormon
church
agreed
with
the
church
to
pay
the
salaries
of
the
church
employees
in
its
office
in
london.
justice
white
well,
the
church
has
an
office
in
london,
let's
assume,
and
it
has
some
employees
there.
justice
white
and
some
one
agrees
with
the
church
to
pay
their
salaries.
justice
white
well,
you
would
say,
you
would
say
that
that,
the
amount
that
they
pay
to
those
individuals--
justice
white
--is
not
deductible.
justice
white
did
i
understand
you
to
answer
justice
stevens
that
if
i
make
a...
if
i
am
a
member
of
the
mormon
church
and
i
make
a,
send
some
money
to
somebody,
not
my
child,
and
say
this
is
in
trust
for
the
mormon
church
and
you
are
to
spend
it
as
the
church
tells
you
to.
that
is
not
deductible,
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
he
sends
it...
i
send
it
to
a
specific
individual.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
well
then,
all,
all
the
parent
has
to
do
every
month
is
to
write
a
letter
like
that,
then?
justice
white
no,
i
send
the
money
to
some
named
person.
justice
white
and
i...
a
missionary.
and
i
say
this
is
in
trust
for
the
church
and
you
are
to
spend
it
as
the
church
tells
you
to.
justice
white
i
thought
that
was
the
example
that
justice
stevens--
justice
white
--well,
let's
take
my
example--
justice
white
--well,
i
am
the
trustee.
i
make
the
person
a
trustee
for
the
church.
i
write
him
a
letter,
you
are
the
trustee
for
the
church.
and
you
are
to
use
this
money
and
spend
it
as
the
church
tells
you
to.
now
what
about
that?
justice
white
well,
the
church,
the
donee
here
is
under
an
obligation
from
the
donor,
if
he
accepts
it,
to
spend
it
the
way
the
church
tells
him
to.
and
the
church
tells
him
here
is
what
you
are
to
spend
it
on:
food,
clothing
and
shelter.
justice
white
so
a
missionary...
the
church
has
a
missionary
sign
a
piece
of
paper
that
says
that
any
funds
you
receive
for
your
support
will
be
held
in
trust
for
the
church.
justice
white
well,
mr.
lee,
i
am
sure
that
for
the
use
of
is
construable
like
you
say
it
is,
but
don't
you
think
it
is
also
possible
to
construe
it
like
the
government
does?
justice
white
well,
no
court?
justice
white
well,
isn't
it...
isn't
this
construction
in
the
regulations,
or
not?
justice
white
i
asked
you
is
it
in
the
regulations?
is
this
construction
in
the
regulations?
justice
white
it
isn't?
justice
white
it
may
be...
it
may
be
that
the
mormon
church
is
one
example
where
the...
maybe
the
problems
of
abuse
or
administration
wouldn't
be
hard,
but
that
might
not
be
true
of
all
the
other
situations
where
these
kind
of
deductions
might
be
claimed
in
connection
with
all
sorts
of
other
churches.
justice
white
well,
all
you,
you
would
just
internalize
this
operation.
you
would
just
get...
you
would
just
have
the
money
come
to
the
church.
justice
white
no,
but
you
wouldn't
have
any
problem.
you
would
just
have...
you
would
then
accumulate
the
total
funds
from
people
to
support
your
missionaries.
