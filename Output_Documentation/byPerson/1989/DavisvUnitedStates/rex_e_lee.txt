mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
federal
income
tax
deductibility
of
contributions
by
the
parents
of
mormon
missionaries
made
directly
to
the
missionaries
for
the
sole
purpose
of
supporting
the
missionary
efforts.
it
is
common
ground
that
payments
to
support
missionary
work
of
a
church
that
qualifies
as
charity,
such
as
the
mormon
church
does,
are
in
general
deductible.
and
the
sole
issue
here
concerns
the
means
by
which
those
payments
are
made.
the
crucial
language
of
the
statute
requires
that
in
order
to
be
deductible
payments
must
be
made
to
or
for
the
use
of
the
church.
the
government's
position
that
any
method
other
than
undifferentiated
payments
to
the
church
itself
can
never,
regardless
of
any
other
circumstances,
be
for
the
use
of
the
church,
not
only
ignores
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
but
it
also
reflects,
as
does
the
government's
entire
brief,
a
profound
failure
to
recognize
even
the
most
fundamental
principles
and
operational
aspects
of
mormon
missionary
work
as
they
are
reflected
in
the
record
in
this
case,
which
must
in
any
event
be
viewed
in
a
light
most
favorable
to
petitioners,
against
whom
summary
judgment
was
entered.
the
only
reason
that
the
petitioners
harold
and
enid
davis--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--excuse
me,
record,
the
factual
record,
yes,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh
no,
no.
you
can
take
it
as
one
that
would
not
have
been
made
but
for
the
fact
that
they
were
missionaries.
but
these
very
petitioners
have
made
contributions
to
missionary
work
other
than
to
their
sons,
and
it
most
assuredly
is
not
the
case
that
they
would
not
have
been
made
but
for
the
fact
that
they
are
their
own
sons.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
would
be--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--the
motive
to
support
the
church's
efforts
is
very
relevant,
because
it
demonstrates
that
the
payments
are
for
the
use
of
the
church.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
then
i
think
you
look
to
what
the
tenth
circuit
said,
what
was
the,
who
was
the
primary
beneficiary.
it
is
not
so
much
motive
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it's
the
primary
beneficiary.
it's
not
so
much
motive,
justice
kennedy,
it
is
who
is
the
beneficiary,
for
whose
use
is
it.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--oh,
i
think
they
are.
i
think
they
are.
and
i
think
the
question
is
not
so
much
the
subjective
one
of
what
the
motive
is,
but
rather
what
the
use
is,
which
is
an
objective
test.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
not
so
long
as
the
difference
between
the
500
and
the
amount
they
gave
did
not
exceed
the
church's
guide...
which
the
church
has
identified
as
the
amount
that
is
necessary
in
order
to
support
their
work.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
and
there
are--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--what
that
shows,
justice
kennedy,
is
160
years'
worth
of
history
in
which
the
mormon
church
prefers
that
its
missionary
work
be
a
total
family
effort,
including
not
only
the
family
support,
but
also
including
specifically
the
direct
payment.
and
if
i
may
elaborate
on
that
just
a
bit,
these
are
reasons
that
go
twice
as
deep
as
the
history
of
the
income
tax
laws
themselves,
and
they
are
borne
out
by
the
church's
amicus
brief
and
by
the
affidavit
of
elder
robert
backman,
who
at
the
time
was
the
executive
director
of
the
missionary
work.
over
its
160-year
history
the
church
has
found
that
missionary
work
has
always
been
family
centered,
from
the
very
beginning,
with
one
or
more
members
devoting
full
uncompensated
time
and
effort,
usually
for
a
period
of
two
years,
while
other
family
members
have
stayed
at
home
but
have
participated
through
their
prayers,
their
letters
and
most
significantly,
from
the
very
beginning,
their
financial
support.
and
what
the
church
has
found
is
that
the
most
effective
missionary
is
one
whose
efforts
are
an
integral
part
of
a
total,
largely...
larger
family
endeavor,
and
that
that
contribution
to
success
from
the
family
involvement
is
more
effectively
achieved
if
the
missionary
each
month
receives
his
check
direct
from
his
family
rather
than
from
the
church
itself.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
the
way
i
would
read
the
statute,
justice
scalia.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
most
assuredly
not.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
not
because...
no.
the
primary
effect
is
not
to
support
the
missionary.
and
that
brings
us
to
another
determination
that
the
church
has
made
which
is
also
of
more
than
100
years'
duration,
and
that
is
that
up
to
the
limits,
that
there
are
certain
limits
which
are
near
survival,
they
border...
frugality
in
the
extreme,
that
serves
the
church's
purposes
for
them
to
have
that
much
money
to
do
their
missionary
work.
now,
if
they
have
money
beyond
that
then
they
have
time
to
spend
on
things
like
movies,
plays
and
so
forth,
and
their
missionary
work
decreases.
and
as
a
consequence,
if
you
were
to
offer
money
to
a
mormon
missionary
to
support
his
efforts,
if
he
is
doing
his
job
right
he
would
just
as
politely
as
possible
refuse
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
he
could
if
you--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
not
for
the
maximal
use
of
the
church.
that
is
not
the
way
the
church
wants
it
done.
his
first
job
is
to
talk
you
out
of
giving
it
to
him,
or
to
give
it
directly
to
the
church--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--all
right.
i
will
take
your
hypothetical.
here
is
what
he
does
do
then.
he
still
supports
his
own
efforts
on
what
his
family
sends
him,
for
reasons
that
i
have
just
stated.
that
is
the
way
he
is
the
most
effective
missionary.
what
he
can
do
is
take
the
money
that
you
give
him
and
send
it
in
to
the
church.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
all
right.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
clearly
you
don't.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
guess
there
is
a
relationship
between
the
motive
and...
and
it
comes
from
the
other
end
also.
because
what
we
are
really
concerned
about
here
is
the
deductibility
to
his
parents,
who
of
course
did
make
the
contribution.
and
i
think
that
while
it
is
principally
an
objective
test,
i
suppose
i
have
to
say,
justice
kennedy,
that
it
is
not
unaffected
by
the
motive,
for
reasons
that
have
just
been
borne
out
by
justice
scalia's
hypothetical.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
i
would
surely
hope
so.
i
would
surely
hope
so.
now,
the
government's
misunderstanding--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
would
certainly
hope
so.
i
can't
tell
that
for
sure
by
reading
the
government's
brief,
but
i
would
surely
hope
so.
the
government
relies
principally
on
a
fairly
consistent
line
of
lower
court
cases
which
involve
charities,
contribution
to
charities,
but
that
are
earmarked
for
particular
individuals.
now,
those
are
lower
court
cases,
they
are
not
binding
on
this
court.
but
we
hope
the
court
finds
them
persuasive,
because
they
solidly
favor
us
and
not
the
government.
some
earmarked
contributions
have
been
held
deductible
across
a
rather
broad
range,
and
most
notably
missionary
contributions
made
to
a
church,
but
earmarked
for
the
use
of
named
individuals.
and
the
leading
cases
are
the
fifth
circuit's
winn
decision
and
the
tax
court's
holding
in
peace.
the
classic
case
of
an
earmarked
contribution
that
is
not
deductible
is
a
contribution
to
pay
the
educational
expenses
of
a
student,
where
the
donor,
rather
than
the
school,
designates
the
recipient.
the
government
contends
that
those--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
the
government
says
that
those
donor-selected
tuition
earmarking
cases
are
analogous.
but
they
are
analogous
only
if
you
accept
the
premise
on
which
the
government
builds
its
entire
case,
and
that
premise
is
the
following.
although
the
church
receives
some
indirect
benefit
from
petitioners'
support
of
their
children,
the
principal
beneficiaries
of
the
payments
were
these
individuals.
the
government's
whole
case
depends
on
the
correctness
of
that
assumption,
that
the
church's
missionary
program
and
the
contributions
that
support
it
are
the
missionaries
themselves.
if
that
assumption
is
correct,
then
the
tuition
earmarking
cases
are
relevant
because
students
are
clearly
the
beneficiaries
of
the
tuition
payments.
but
that
assumption
bears
no
resemblance
to
fact,
as
the
record
here
shows.
far
from
being
its
beneficiaries,
mormon
missionaries
are
the
church's
missionary
program.
the
church
has
no
other
agents
by
which
it
carries
out
its
missionary
programs,
other
than
these
young
people
who
wear
white
shirts
and
blouses
and
go
in
pairs.
the
beneficiaries
are
the
people
that
they
teach.
these
people
devote
two
prime-time
years,
putting
everything
else
on
hold,
school,
social
life,
dating,
family
contacts,
recreation,
everything,
not
because
it
will
advance
any
interest
of
their
own,
but
because
of
their
religious
convictions
about
the
importance
of
their
message.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
except
that
it
is
not
the
same
issue
for
two
reasons.
you
are
talking,
of
course,
about
the
hernandez
case,
and
there
the
issue
was
not
the,
whether
it
was
to
or
for
the
use
of,
it
was
a
question
of
whether
these
were
gifts
or
contributions.
and
if
there
should
be
any
doubt
about
this,
there
is
no
quid
pro
quo
problem
here.
and
the
reason
is,
there
is
a
very
important
reason,
the
church
itself
has
the
ultimate
responsibility
to
see
that
these
missionary
expenses
are
paid
for.
and
in
the
event
that
some
parents
cannot
or
will
not
pay
the
missionary
expenses,
the
church
picks
it
up
and
pays
it
out
of
its
own,
out
of
its
own
funds.
but
to
a
greater
extent
than
is
true
of
any
other
endeavor
of
which
i
am
aware,
the
life
of
the
mormon
missionary
is
devoted
exclusively
to
one
use,
and
that
use
belongs
to
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
latter-day
saints.
these
people
are
no
more
beneficiaries
of
the
church's
missionary
program
than
a
catholic
nun
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
school
in
which
she
teaches,
or
a
red
cross
volunteer
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
red
cross'
disaster
relief
efforts.
look
at
the
record.
benjamin
davis
averaged
over
70
hours
a
week
in
proselyting,
plus
another
10
in
study
and
preparations
to
proselyte,
and
his
brother
cecil
averaged
60
hours
a
week
proselyting,
plus
10
to
25
hours
in
preparation,
which
included
language
study,
because
he,
unlike
his
brother,
did
his
proselyting
in
a
foreign
tongue.
now,
80
hours
a
week
is
hardly
incidental.
they
were
doing
only
one
thing,
and
that
was
proselyting.
any
other
activities
were
incidental
to
and
in
support
of
their
proselyting,
and
they
were
doing
it
on
behalf
of
or
for
the
use
of
the
church.
and
it
necessarily
follows
that
donations
which
do
nothing
more
than
sustain
those
proselyting
efforts
are
also
necessarily
for
the
use
of
the
church.
harold
davis's
affidavit,
which
is
part
of
the
record,
states
unequivocally
that
his
motive
was
a
sincere
religious
desire
to
support
the
church's
missionary
program,
and
that
his
contributions
were
subject
to
a
clear
understanding
and
commitment
by
the
sons
that
the
money
would
be
used
only
in
accordance
with
church
guidelines
for
necessary
mission-related
expenditures,
and
was
not
intended
by
this...
for
the
sons
to
use
as
they
might
see
fit.
now,
there
is
no
question
that
there
are
benefits,
but
they
are
religious
in
nature.
insofar
as
any
progress
toward
any
other
goal
that
might
relate
to
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
be
motivated
by
other
than
religion,
it
is
negative.
after
those
two
years,
typically
it
comes
right
in
the
middle
of
a
college
career,
and
there
is
some
retooling
time
and
effort
that
is
required
once
they
return.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course.
and
they
were
supporting
them
had
they
been
doing
something
else.
and
that
something
else
was
attending
college.
but
the
attending
college
was
preparing
them
for
something
that
was
related
not
to
the
use
of
the
church,
not
for...
but
rather
for
their
own
interest,
and
therefore
for
their
parents
interest.
this
involved
taking
time
out
from
that,
putting
everything
else
on
hold,
and
devoting
100
percent
of
their
time
solely
for
the
use
of
the
church.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
it
would.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
record
sets
that
forth,
yes.
those
are
church
monies.
once
they
are
devoted,
and
the
record
is
very
clear,
elder
backman's
affidavit
is
very
clear
on
this
point.
once
those
monies
are
given
to
them
for
that
purpose,
they
are
for
the
use
of
the
church.
and
similarly,
if
i
can
just
drive
that
home
a
little
further,
there
are
areas
in
the
world
where
those
guideline
amounts
are
so
low
that
if
you
multiplied
the
monthly
amount
times
12
it
comes
out
to
less
than
$1,000
a
year.
so
that
it
would
actually
be
more
advantageous
to
the
parents
to
take
them
as
an
exemption
than
it
would
to
claim
the
income
tax
deductions.
they
are
not
entitled
to
that
exemption,
in
our
view,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
would
be
more
advantageous,
because
they
are
not
being
supported
by
their
parents.
they
lack
therefore
the
support
feature.
those
are
church
monies
once
they
are
given
to
them.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
belong
to
the
church
in
the
sense
that
the
church
was...
if
i
can,
there
was
a
fiduciary
relationship
in
which
the
money
was
technically
and
legally
in
their
name,
but
the
use
belonged
to
the
church,
in
typical
fiduciary--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
yes,
particularly
for
de
minimis
kinds
of
things
like
that.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
elder
backman's
affidavit,
plus--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--excuse
me?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
robert
backman,
and
it
is
in
appendix
to
the
petition.
and
also,
there
is
a
letter
that
went
out
from
the
church
that
states
it
even
more
clearly.
and
i
need
to
clarify
the
status
of
that
letter.
it
appears
in
the
appendix
to
the
church's
amicus
brief.
it
is
part
of
the
record
in
the
white
case
in
the
tenth
circuit.
for
some
reason
it
is
not
in
the
record
in
this
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
understand.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
understand.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
elder
backman's
affidavit.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
in
the
petition...
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
in
our
view,--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--we
have
talked
about
that,
and
i
think
the
answer
is,
technically,
yes.
in
fact--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no.
no,
there
is
not.
what
would
happen,
in
fact,
justice
kennedy,
is
self-help.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
control
that
the
church
exercises
over
these
missionaries,
and
that
is
much
more
effective
than
a
prosecution.
i
come
next
to
the
fact
that
"for
the
use
of"
really
is,
to
a
large
extent,
fact
bound.
and
in
reaching
the
final
question
of
which...
of
whether
these
are
or
are
not
"for
the
use
of",
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
two
propositions.
first
of
all,
to
the
extent
that
there
are
any
of
these
factual
issues
that
are
not
adequately
developed,
we
would
invite
the
court
to
remand
for
the
development
of
any
further
issues.
indeed,
i
would
point
out
that
in
the
brinley
case,
which
is
the
mormon
missionary
case
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
circuit
did
just
exactly
that
with
regard
to
such
issues
as
the
chief
justice,
necessarily,
the
chief
justice
has
just
been
asking.
but
i
would
also
invite
the
court's
attention
to
these
four
considerations.
the
first
is
that
the
church
carries
out
its
missionary
program
exclusively
through
the
efforts
of
these
young
men
and
women.
there
are
no
others.
second,
it
is
the
church's
program.
they
are
the
church's
missionaries,
and
the
ultimate
financial
obligation
is
on
the
church.
there
are
thousands
of
cases
throughout
the
world
in
which
they
can't
do
it
the
preferred
way,
and
the
church
always
picks
up
the
slack,
and
they
have
the
ultimate
responsibility.
third,
the
church,
in
its
own
interest,
has
set
guidelines
for
monthly
missionary
expenditures
in
different
parts
of
the
world.
as
the
court
can
determine
from
consulting
those
guidelines,
they
can
only
be
described
as
frugal
in
the
extreme.
and
they
always
will
be,
because
the
church
has
determined
that
above
those
guideline
amounts
there
is
an
inverse
relationship
between
the
amounts
that
are
spent
and
the
effectiveness
of
their
missionary
work.
and
finally
this,
absent
religious
conviction
there
is
not
a
person
in
this
court
room
who
would
send
his
son
or
daughter
off
for
two
years
to
do
the
kinds
of
things
that
benjamin
and
cecil
davis
did,
in
the
prime
of
life
and
educational
opportunity.
the
incidental
benefits
to
the
children
and
the
parents
simply
would
not
be
worth
the
cost.
why,
then,
did
harold
and
enid
davis
do
it,
and
why
were
cecil
and
benjamin
anxious
to
go?
and
the
answer
is
obvious.
it
was
because
of
religious
conviction
that
they
gave
two
of
their
best
years,
plus
the
meager
amounts
to
pay
their
expenses,
and
they
did
it
that
way
because
the
church
wanted
it
done
that
way.
it
was
for
the
use
of
the
church.
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
very,
very
early
in
the
church.
but
that
has
not
been
within
either
my
memory
or
yours.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
about
four
to
one.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
about
four
to
one.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me,
you
cannot?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
i
will
assume--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
will
assume
with
you
that
that
is
correct,
but
that
is
quite
different
from
the
church
asking
that
they
go
and
do
things
that
are...
that
carry
out
a
responsibility
that
is
one
of
the
three
core
functions
that
the
church
has
identified,
and
do
it
on
behalf
of
the
church.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
absolutely,
absolutely.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
regard
to
whether
they
were
fiduciaries,
i
think
probably
the
better
support,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
was
mistaken,
is
probably
in
the
davis
affidavit,
paragraphs
nine
and
10.
i
think
it
also
permeates
the
backman
affidavit.
actually
the
best
statement
is
in
that
letter
from
the
church
that
is
in
the
record
in
the
white
case,
but
not
this
case...
but
not
this
case.
but
i
would
refer
you
to
justice
white's
question
to
ms.
peterson.
aren't
they
under
an
obligation
to
spend
this
money
only
for
missionary
work,
and
there
is
just
no
question
about
that.
and
if
there
is
any,
then
it
ought
to
be
remanded
for
those
purposes.
moreover,
the
government
itself
on
other
occasions
has
taken
a
position
quite
inconsistent
with
the
one
it
has
taken
here.
in
the
rockefeller
case,
in
a
brief
that
has
been
lodged
with
the
court,
the
government
said
many
payments,
other
than
payments
to
a
trust,
are
payments
for
the
use
of
charity.
but
the
language
of
this
statute
says
is
not
to
an
intermediary
trust
that
will
eventually
be
transferred
to
someone
else.
it
says
for
the
use
of.
and
there
are
many
instances,
many
instances
in
which
the
lower
courts
have
recognized
payments
as
being
for
the
use
that
are
not
in
a
strictly
fiduciary
capacity,
such
as,
and
those
are
cited
in
our
brief,
such
as
payments
by
a
big
brother
directly
to
a
little
brother,
disaster
relief
payments,
unwed
mother
payments,
and...
so
that
in
short
we
think
we
satisfied
the
trust
relationship--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no.
no
court
has
construed
it
the
way
the
government
does,
justice
white,
and
i
want
to
make
that
very,
very
clear--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no
court.
absolutely
none.
the
ninth
circuit
does
not
agree
with
ms.
peterson.
what
the
ninth
circuit
says
is
that
earmarking
is
all
right,
so
long
as
the
church
has
possession.
now
that's...
that's
not
our
preferred
position,
but
we
like
it
a
lot
better
than
what
the
government
is
suggesting.
and
there
is
no
court
that
supports
the
proposition
that
absolutely
no
earmarking
is
ever
sufficient.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
yield
to
no
one,
justice
white,
in
my
respect
for
the
government's...
for
that
rule,
not
from
this
pulpit.
i
have
advocated
it
many
times.
but
that
rule
has
never
said
that
the
government
wins
its
cases
and
it
can
use
it
to
bootstrap...
there
has
never--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
it
definitely
is
not
in
the
regulations.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
no.
they
use
it
for
litigation
purposes...
well,
i
wouldn't
say
that.
[laughter]
but
you
can
see
that
in
rockefeller,
when
it
served
their
purposes
to
do
otherwise,
they
said
there
are
many
cases
other
than
a
trust
that
can
be
for
the
use
of
the
church.
now
let
me,
let
me
just
lay
to
rest
this
business
about
abuse
and
about
the
impossible...
i
have
never
understood
those
arguments.
first,
insofar
as
the
impossibility
of
administration.
it
is
not
the
church
that
is
going
to
be
audited;
it
is
the
taxpayer
that
is
going
to
be
audited.
and
you
ask
two
questions.
and
the
burden
of
proof
to
satisfy
these
questions
is
on
the
taxpayer.
first,
are
these
people
on
missions?
yes
or
no,
and
present
me
proof.
second,
do
these
payments
come
within
the
guidelines
that
the
church
has
set,
and
are
those
guidelines
out
of
line?
now,
you
are
going
to
have
to
do
that
in
any
event.
and
if
i
make
the
payment
directly
to
a
church
fund
and
the
church
then
sends
that
money
on
to
my
child,
i
will
assure
you
the
church
is
not
going
to
send
any
more
nor
less
money
than
what
i
am
sending
within
those
guidelines.
i
do
not
understand
that
administration
problem.
similarly,
i
do
not
understand
the
abuse
problem.
we
are
told
that
there
are
two.
the
first
is
that
of
shifting
deductions
from
a
higher
taxpayer
to
a
lower
bracket
taxpayer.
that
is
just
plain
not
a
problem.
these
people
who
are...
because
you
can
only
shift
if
you
shift
large
amounts.
and
the
only
amounts
that
are
going
to
be
deductible
are
the
amounts
that
the
church
has
designated
in
any
event
for
its
own
use.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
justice
rehnquist,
there
is
no
one
who
is
going
to
be
able
to
live
in
washington,
d.c.
on
much
less
than
$310
a
month.
and
so
the
only
thing
that
you
are
going
to
be
able
to
shift
is
the
difference
between
whatever
in
fact
they
spend
and
the
$310
a
month.
now,
insofar
as
the
double
deductions
are
concerned,
that
is
equally
illusory
because
of
the
fact
that
these
are
people
who
don't
have
any
income.
these
are
college
students
who
take
time
out
from
their
college.
they
don't
have
anything
from
which
to
deduct
those
amounts.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
but
wouldn't
it
be
too
bad
if
we
lost
this
case
and
lost
160
years'
worth
of
tradition
because
of
problems
that
you
might
attribute
to
somebody
else?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
earmarked?
they
won't
let
us
do
it
that
way.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
may
i
just
respond
to
that,
mr.
chief
justice?
