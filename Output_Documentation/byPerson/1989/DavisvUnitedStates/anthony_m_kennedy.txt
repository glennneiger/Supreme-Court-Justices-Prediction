justice
kennedy
and
on
that
point,
mr.
lee,
can
we
take
this
case
as
one
in
which
the
donations
or
the
payments
would
not
have
been
made
but
for
the
parent-child
relation?
justice
kennedy
well,
if...
suppose
we
had
had
a
trial,
and
as
a
factual
matter
the
parents
said
well,
i
just
want
it
understood
that
of
course
i
supported
the
church
and
its
doctrines
and
the
missionary
movement,
but
the
only
reason
i
made
these
particular
payments
was
the
fact
that
it
was
my
boy
that
was
doing
the
missionary
work.
justice
kennedy
would
that
be,
then,
a
different
case?
justice
kennedy
so
motive
isn't
irrelevant?
justice
kennedy
or
isn't
relevant?
justice
kennedy
well,
then,
suppose
there
is
a
mixed
motive?
justice
kennedy
well,
is
it
the
primary
motive
or
the
primary
beneficiary?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
think
those
are
two
different
tests.
justice
kennedy
but
doesn't
that
show
that
there
is
not
a
detached
motive
of
generosity
for
the
church?
justice
kennedy
under
that
affidavit,
which
is
at
page
28a,
suppose,
following
justice
stevens'
question,
contrary
to
the
doctrines
of
his
church
and
the
wishes
of
his
parents,
a
missionary
took
the
money
for
a
color
television
set
and
bought
the
color
television.
would
the
church
have
an
action
against
him
for
embezzlement,
or
civil
action
for
return
of
the
funds?
justice
kennedy
is
there
something
in
the
backman
affidavit
that
tells
us--
justice
kennedy
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
kennedy
if...
if
the
case
showed
that
the...
that
the
church
had
legal
control
over
the
funds,
would
the
case
be
different?
justice
kennedy
no,
no,
it's
this
case,
but
the
church
has
legal
control
over
the
funds.
justice
kennedy
so...
so...
so
then
your
argument
that
it
be,
that
it
is
paid
directly
to
the
missionary
is,
is
not
dispositive.
justice
kennedy
well,
let's
say
the
missionary
writes
a
letter
to
the
church
and
said
as
your
agent
i
have
just
received
$1,500,
which
i
am
depositing
in
a
bank
account
subject
to
whatever
control
you
wish,
and
until
i
hear
further
from
you
i
shall
expend
it
for
my
support
during
my
mission.
justice
kennedy
well,
it's
the
case
i
gave
you.
justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
he
says
that
he
is.
justice
kennedy
well,
mr.
lee
said
it
has
been
established
over
hundreds
of
years.
justice
kennedy
well,
you
don't
argue,
i
take
it,
along
the
lines
of
the
court's
earlier
questions
to
mr.
lee
that
there
was
a
motive
here
that
is
relevant
to
the
determination
of
the
case.
or--
justice
kennedy
--is
that
in
your
brief
or
not?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
didn't
argue
it
in
your
brief,
in
other
words.
justice
kennedy
ms.
peterson,
what
cases
do
you
cite
for
that
proposition?
justice
kennedy
but
what
case
do
you
cite
in
your
brief
for
that?
justice
kennedy
russell
v.
allen?
justice
kennedy
ms.
peterson--
--well,
in
justice
white's
hypothetical,
suppose
that
the
donor
said
i
don't
know
who
any
of
your
people
in
london
are,
but
i
think
it
is
important
for
you
to
do
your
work
in
london.
i
will
simply
send
a
check
to
all
the
people
that
are
working
for
you
in
london
for
their
year's
work.
just
give
me
their
names.
justice
kennedy
it
is
not
to
the
church,
it
is
made
to
the
people.
justice
kennedy
the
donor
never,
didn't
know
it,
doesn't
know
who
they
are.
he
just
asked
the
church
for
their
names.
