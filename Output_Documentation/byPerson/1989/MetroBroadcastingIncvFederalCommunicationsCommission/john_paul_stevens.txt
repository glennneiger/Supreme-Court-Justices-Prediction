justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
this?
supposing
i
concluded
that
the
racial
preference
was
invalid
and
the
gender
preference
was
valid.
how
should
i
vote?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
that's
not
my
question.
[laughter]
can
you...
can
you
answer
my
question?
justice
stevens
the
simple
answer
to
my
question
is
if
i
think
the
racial
preference
is
bad
and
the
gender
preference
is
all
right,
i
should
still
vote
to
reverse.
that's
what
you're
telling
me?
justice
stevens
but
if
that's
the
disposition,
then
i
would
not
have
to
reach
the
gender
preference.
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand,
but
as
you
have
just
told
us
we
review
judgments.
we
don't
have
to
decide
all
the
future
cases
that
come
down
the
line.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
how
do
we
know
the
next
group
of
commissioners
is
going
to
follow
the
same
policy?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question
there?
justice
stevens
supposing
two
alternatives:
one,
that
all
of
the
broadcast
media
in
the
country
were
owned
by
white
males,
100
percent,
and
the
second
hypothesis,
that
80
percent
were
owned
by
white
males
and
20
percent
were
owned
by
minority
groups
of
various
characteristics.
do
you
think
it
is
safe
to
say
that
there
will
be
no
difference
in
the
diversity
of
programming
between
the
two
hypotheses?
justice
stevens
just
whatever...
the
whole
spectrum
that
the
fcc
licenses.
justice
stevens
he
said
they
weren't
exclusively,
but
he
said
primarily,
yes.
justice
stevens
well,
in
any
event,
are
they
entirely
market
driven?
justice
stevens
so
your
answer
then
is
you
can
safely
predict
there
would
be
no
difference
between
the
programs
in
the
two
hypotheses.
justice
stevens
yeah.
is
that
critical
to
your
argument
that
we
accept
that
as
a
factual
premise?
justice
stevens
of
course,
there's
no
doubt.
obviously
you're
correct
there.
but
your
feeling
is
that
the
program
ownership
is
totally
irrelevant
to
the...
to
the
programming?
justice
stevens
would
it
be
true
also,
i
suppose,
if
100
percent
of
the
stations
were
owned
by
democrats
and
then
in
the
other
alternative
would
be
100
or
80
percent
democrats
and
20
republicans.
we'd
also
assume
there'd
be
absolutely
no
difference
in
the
programming?
[laughter]
justice
stevens
well,
of
course
that
depends
on
the
whites
and
the
blacks
or
not.
justice
stevens
but
supposing
the
commission
went
out
and
that
survey
and
found
out
they
were
all
owned
by
democrats
and
they
decided
to
set
aside
a
few
for
republicans?
justice
stevens
they're
just
interested
in
diversity?
justice
stevens
they're
just
interested
in
diversity,
i
say,
and
you'd
say
that's
totally
irrational
to
assume
that
would
produce
any
diversity
because
everybody's
market
driven.
politics,
race,
all
these
things
don't
make
any
difference
at
all
in
program
planning.
justice
stevens
i
suppose
democrats
and
republicans
are
entitled
to
be
treated
equally.
justice
stevens
and
does
the
personnel
of
the
commission
have
to
be
politically...
isn't
there
some
requirement
that
different
parties
be
represented?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
is
it...
is
it
irrational
to
assume
that
a
greater
percentage
of
black
people
like
that
kind
of
music
than
the
same
corresponding
percentage
of
white
people?
justice
stevens
that's
irrational?
