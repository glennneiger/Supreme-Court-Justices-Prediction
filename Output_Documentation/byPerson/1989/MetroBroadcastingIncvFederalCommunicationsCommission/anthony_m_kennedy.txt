justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
that
we
had
a
difficult
time
establishing
that
state
discrimination
was
responsible
for
this
disparity
in
minority
ownership,
couldn't
the
congress,
pursuant
to
its
commerce
powers
or
pursuant
to
the
powers
it
has
to
regulate
the
airwaves,
which
essentially
comes
from
the
commerce
power,
simply
say
that
as
a
matter
of
sound
policy
we
want
minority
ownership?
why
do
we
need
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
we're
acting
in
an
area
which
is
acknowledged
to
be
an
exclusively
federal
area?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
why
is
congress
limited
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
when
it
makes...
when
it
has
a
remedial
program?
justice
kennedy
has
there
been
any
argument
by
the
fcc
or
the
competing
applicants
here
who
rest
on
their
minority
credentials,
has
there
been
any
argument
that
the
fcc
has
in
any
way
furthered
discrimination
by
its
past
licensing
activities?
justice
kennedy
--well,
in
your
view,
then,
could
the
fcc
require
that
every
broadcast
station
in
the
united
states
devote
one
hour
a
week
to
minority...
the
expression
of
minority
views?
justice
kennedy
assuming
we
can
define
that.
justice
kennedy
so,
it
can
do...
so
it
can
do
so
indirectly
what
it
can't
do
directly?
justice
kennedy
but...
but
you're
trying
to
achieve
content
regulation
nonetheless?
justice
kennedy
so...
so
you're
trying
to--
--you're
saying
you
cannot...
that
it
can't
be
done?
justice
kennedy
and
you're
doing
that
to
accomplish
a
goal
which
you
think
is
so
constitutionally
sensitive,
you
think
it's
even
inappropriate
for
you
to
measure
it
directly?
justice
kennedy
under
the
commission's
rationale,
i
take
it,
if
there's
a
community
with
a
substantial
hispanic
population,
an
asian
owner
of
the
applicant
gets
the
race
preference
under
the
fcc
statute,
or
must
there
be
some
parallel
between
the
composition
of
the
local
community
and
the
particular
minority
being
given
the
preference?
justice
kennedy
well,
my
question
was
how...
my
question
is
how
does
it
work?
justice
kennedy
so
there's
no...
so
there's
no
correlation
required
between
the
race
of
the
owners
and
the
racial
composition
of
the
community
that
it
serves?
justice
kennedy
and
who
you
are
is
your
race,
under
your
view...
in
the
commission's
view?
justice
kennedy
of
course,
i
take
it
diversity
of
views
is
a
constant
goal.
if
you
reached
racial
proportionality,
whatever
that
means,
in
ownership
and
the
regulations
ceased
and
there
was
an
imbalance,
i
would
suppose
the
same
diversity
of
view
problem
would
arise.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
are...
since
you
are
not
relying
on
something
that
is
remedial,
you
are
espousing
a
rationale
that
must
necessarily
be
permanent.
justice
kennedy
wouldn't
it
still
be
fair
to
say,
then,
that
diversity
of
ownership
is
not
an
end
in
itself?
justice
kennedy
mr.
wollenberg--
--it
sounded
to
me
like
you
said
that
it
is
an
end
in
itself.
justice
kennedy
it
sounded
to
me--
justice
kennedy
may
i...
may
i
just
ask
you,
on
the
joint
exhibit...
joint
appendix
68
there's
a
chart
which
shows
capital
contributions
and
percentage
interests.
justice
kennedy
and
i
see
mr.
ramirez
made
a
contribution
of
$210
and
had
a
21
percent
percentage
interest
and
a
mr.
and
mrs.
rose
had
an
$830,000
contribution
for
a
6
percent
interest.
what...
what...
is
this
just
voting,
voting
power?
justice
kennedy
so
the
percentage
interest
appears
to
be
ownership
equity--
justice
kennedy
--so
far
as
your
understanding?
justice
kennedy
thank
you.
but
he
got
this
for
$210?
justice
kennedy
is
there
any
requirement
that
the
station...
the
property
be
held
for
a
particular
amount
of
time?
justice
kennedy
if
it
becomes
profitable,
if
it
can
be
sold?
justice
kennedy
but
after
one
year
the
new
owners
are
free
to
sell
it?
