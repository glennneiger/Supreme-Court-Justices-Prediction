mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
this
case
involves
the
fcc's
policies
of
awarding
substantial
preferences
in
comparative
licensing
proceedings
to
certain
minority
and
female
applicants
for
new
television
and
radio
broadcast
stations
throughout
the
united
states.
the
petitioner
metro
in
1982
filed
its
application
for
a
construction
permit
for
a
new
uhf
television
station
at
channel
60
in
orlando,
florida
but
ultimately
lost
in
the
comparative
contest
due
to
rainbow
broadcasting
company,
the
respondent
intervenors',
enhancement
credits
for
minority
and
female
ownership
composition.
this
outcome,
along
with
the
preferential
treatment
policies
resulting
in
it,
was
upheld
by
the
u.s.
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
by
a
2-1
decision.
the
lower
court's
holding
had
followed
an
initial
remand
in
the
case
and
the
remand
of
the
record
in
the
case
as
part
of
an
active
investigation
into
the
factual
statutory
and
constitutional
underpinnings
of
the
commission's
preference
policies.
during
the
remand,
the
commission
had
held
all
cases
in
abeyance,
including
the
present
one,
pending
its
determination
regarding
whether
the
policies
were
ordinarily
tailored
and
otherwise
constitutional.
but
in
1987
the
congress
passed
an
appropriations
act
defunding
the
commission's
inquiry
and
specifically
directing
that
this
case
be
decided
in
accordance
with
the
minority
and
female
preferences
that
existed
prior
to
the
remand.
the
issues
presented
in
the
case
are
twofold:
one,
whether
the
commission's
policies
of
awarding
the
preferences,
which
were
created
absent
any
findings
of
past
discrimination
and
for
the
sole
purpose
of
promoting
program
diversity,
violate
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
and
secondly,
whether
the
congressional
entrenchment
of
the
communications...
the
federal
communications
commission's
policies
and
its
other
associated
actions
in
the
appropriations
act
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
or
exceeded
its
authority,
whatever
authority
it
has
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
this
case
is
unlike
other
so-called
affirmative
action
cases
which
this
court
has
heard
in
the
past.
unlike
the
model
program
approved
in
fullilove
or
the
academic
admissions
system
hypothetically
approved
by
the
court
in
bakke,
in
this
case
the
preference
programs
of
the
fcc
have
resulted
in
actual
discrimination
against
metro
broadcasting
which,
importantly,
is
a
corporation
comprised
of
both
a
minority
member
and
nonminority
members.
unlike
the
program
under
review
in
fullilove,
the
programs
reviewed
in
wygant
or
croson,
the
fcc's
preference
policies
are
not
founded
on
the
remedying
of
past
discrimination
but
upon
the
pursuit
of
program
diversity,
an
amorphous
concept
which,
as
we
shall
examine,
has
intense
first
amendment
implications
as
well.
unlike
the
other
programs
reviewed
by
this
court
in
the
past,
three
separate
governmental
entities,
not
just
one,
have
had
a
hand
in
establishing
or
perpetuating
the
commission's
policies:
the
courts,
the
fcc
and
the
congress.
but
regardless
of
these
distinctions
between
this
case
and
past
cases,
one
thing
is
for
certain;
and
that
is,
that
the
commission's
policies
impose
race,
gender
and
ethnic-based
classifications
and
that
those
classifications,
we
feel,
are
presumptively
invalid
but,
at
minimum,
they
require
close
examination.
metro
recognizes
that
there--
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
--is
diversity
of
perspective--
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
--yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
it
is
absolutely
clear,
in
our
opinion,
that
the
gender-based
issue
is...
is
before
the
court
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
lower
court
did
not
consider
gender.
it
only
considered
the
minority
preferences
because
of
dicta
contained
in
the
commission's
denial
of
metro's
application
for
review
that
said
that
the
minority...
it
was
not
clear
that
the
gender
preference,
being
only
a
5
percent
one,
was
dispositive
in
the
case.
however,
on
remand,
in
an
actual
order
of
the
commission,
which
we
feel
is
what
this
court
should
review,
the
commission
held
that
the
minority
and
female
preferences
together
were
dispositive,
and
that
was
the
holding
of
the
review
board
as
well.
this
court
is
to
review
judgments,
we
feel,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out
in
fullilove
at
page
411,
note
6,
and
black
v.
cutler
labs,
and
not
just
statements
such
as
the
one
accompanying
the
commission's
denial
of
metro's
application
for
review.
but
there
is...
there
is
a
more
important
reason,
your
honor,
and
that
is
that
in
this
case,
as
we
shall
examine,
the
minority
and
female
preferences
are
pitted
together
in
a
comparative
licensing
proceeding.
they
are
not...
neither
one
of
them...
are
considered
separately,
and
you
really
can't
examine
one
without
examining
the
other.
and
you
can't
really
examine
the
tailoring
of
the
program
without
examining
how
the
two...
the
two
preferences
fit
together,
both
the
gender
and
the
minority
and
ethnic
preferences.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
it's
a
close
call,
your
honor.
i
feel
that
we
would,
but
what...
but
the
more
important
thing
is
what
the
result
would
be
for
the
commission's
comparative
process
and
the
remainder
of
the
people
that
have
to
go
through
it
for
the
next
few
years.
if
for
some
reason,
the
minority
preference
classification
is
struck
by
this
court
as
invalid
but
the
gender
classification
stands,
then
people
are
going
to
start
searching
for
a
difference
in
the
rationale
between
the
two
policies.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
actually,
it
would
not,
your
honor,
because
metro
prevailed
on
the...
on
the
other
criterion
recognized
by
the
commission
below,
particularly
local
residence
and
civic
participation.
now
the...
the
minority
enhancement
policies
have
the...
the
minority
enhancement
credit
has
the
same
weight
as
the
weight
given
for
local
residence,
so
that
neutralized
the
local
residence
factor
in
this
case.
in
order
to
understand
why
metro
still
lost,
the
female
preference
has
to
defeat
the
civic
participation
credit
which
metro
received
in
the
case,
and
that
is
the
only
thing
to
explain
why
all
of
metro's
comparative
qualifications
were
not
sufficient
for
it
to
prevail
over
rainbow.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
that
is
not
clear,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
the
commission's
decision,
we
don't
feel,
can
be...
can
be
affirmed
on
any
grounds,
but
the
racial
and
gender
preferences
had
a
synergistic
effect
in
the
present
proceeding.
that's
our...
that's
our
position,
and
the
reason
this
is
somewhat
confusing
now
is
because
we
have
an--
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
--but
we...
a
remand
is
certainly
a
possibility,
and
though
we
don't
favor
one
we're
not
discounting
it.
but
unfortunately,
neither
the
review
board's
decision
nor
the
commission's
decision
says
what
the
exact
weight
was
that
was
accorded
between
the
minority
and
female
preferences
in
this
case.
they
both
list
them
together
in
the
same
sentence
and
say
that
together
they
resulted
in
the
outcome.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
i
still
think,
justice
stevens,
that
you
should
vote
for
the
invalidation
of
both--
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
--i
think
that
you
should...
you
should
vote
to...
to
award
the
construction
permit
to
metro,
and
if...
and
if
it's
not
clear
in
the
record
as
to
what
the
separate
bases
were
for
the
two
preferences,
then
a
remand
is
a
possible--
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
--we
feel
that
you
should,
your
honor,
but
again,
we're
limited
by
the
judgment
of
the
review
board
and
the
fcc,
and
it's
not
clear
that
they
feel
the
same
way.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
we
feel
that
there
are
serious
consequences
in
not
reaching
the
gender
preference.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
that's
right,
your
honor.
well,
a
remand
is
a
possibility,
your
honor,
if
you
were
to
uphold
one
of
the
preferences
and
not
the
other,
and
we're
open
to
that.
but
as...
as
we
go
along,
we
feel
that
the...
that
the
two
must
be
considered
together.
the
commission
has
said
that
the
rationale
underlying
the
two
preferences
are
the
same,
and
the
only
reason
that
people
wanted
them
considered
separately
is
because
no
one
wants
to
focus
on
the
way
that
the
two
policies
operate
together,
and
that
is
one
of
the
burdens
that's
imposed
upon
not
only
nonminorities
but
minorities
under
the
commission's
preference
plan.
to
the
extent
that
female
ownership
is
said
to
contribute
to
program
diversity
and
that
it's
valuable,
every
time
a
female
applicant
comes
against
an
applicant
that
has
a
minority
principal,
that
value
is
defeated,
and
so
there
is
also
an
impact
on
minorities
and
females
that
have
been...
that
are
the
acknowledged
beneficiaries
of
the
program.
in
order
to
clarify
these
things
a
little
bit,
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
way
that
these
policies
developed
and
how
the
weights
of
the
two
policies
really
came
about.
the
communications
act
of
1934
gave
the
commission
a
broad
public
interest
mandate
in
awarding
licenses
for
broadcast
stations,
and
it
said
that
in
making
a
grant
of
any
application
it
was
to
determine
that
the
public
interest
would
be
served
thereby.
if
more
than
one
applicant
applied
for
a
broadcast
station,
a
comparative
hearing
must
be
held
to
determine
which
of
the
applicants
would
provide
the
best
service
to
the
public
in
favor
of
the
public
interest.
the
communications
act
didn't
establish
any
criteria
for
rendering
this
determination,
and
after
many
years
of
trial
and
error,
in
1965
the
commission
passed
its
policy
statement
on
comparative
broadcast
hearings,
which
identified
two
general
goals
which
were
to
govern
the
entire
licensing
process.
the
first
was
to
effect
a
maximum
diffusion,
or
diversification
of
control
of
the
media
of
mass
communications.
this
was
a
goal
that
had
grounds
in
both
antitrust
and
first
amendment
considerations.
given
the
presumed
scarcity
of
the
broadcast
spectrum,
the
antitrust
considerations
would
disfavor
one
person
or
just
a
few
people
having
control
over
all
of
the
media
outlets
in
the
united
states.
the
second
acknowledged
goal
of
the
program
is
to
achieve
the
best
practicable
service
to
the
public.
this
criteria,
unlike
the
diversification
criterion,
was
based
on
an
examination
of
what
the
proposed
broadcaster
would
do
for
the
local
community,
for
the
community
of
license
that
was
proposed.
in
the
old
days,
prior
to
the
deregulatory
era,
potential
licensees
had
to
go
out
into
the
communities
and
ascertain
the
community
needs
by
interviewing
public
officials,
interviewing
minority
groups
and
finding
out
what
gaps
needed
to
be
filled
in
programming.
those
requirements
are
no
more.
the
commission
prepared
criteria
from
the
1965
policy
statement
originally
were
race
neutral.
that
changed,
however,
in
1973.
tv
9
v.
fcc
was
the
d.c.
circuit
court
of
appeals'
direction
to
the
fcc
that
minority
ownership
must
be
taken
into
account
in
accordance
with
the
public
interest
standard...
mandate
of
the
fcc.
but
the
decision
didn't
really
clarify
where
it
was
to
be
taken
into
account
in
the
commission's
comparative
process,
and
there
has
been
a
lot
of
question
about
that.
the
rationale
for
taking
race
into
account
expressed
in
tv
9
was
that
there
would
be
a
maximum
diffusion
of
ownership
of
the
media
of
mass
communications
if
we
kind
of
broke
up
concentrations
of
certain
minority...
certain
majority
groups
in
the
media.
it
was
a
diversification-based
criteria.
pursuant
thereto,
the
court
said
that
it's
upon
ownership
that
the
public
policy
places
primary
reliance
with
respect
to
diversification
of
content.
all
of
the
content
language
in
tv
9,
all
of
the
goals
of
serving
program
diversity,
were
really
supposed
benefits
of
pursuing
the
primary
goal
of
diffusion
of
the
media
of
mass
communications.
the
fcc
in
1978
did
not
give
a
preference
for
minority
ownership
under
the
diversification
criterion,
however,
notwithstanding
this
language
in
tv
9.
in
wpix,
the
commission
chose
to
award
enhancements
under
the
best
practicable
service
criterion,
a
criterion
not
grounded
in
whether
one
group
has
control
over
the
media,
but
a
criterion
grounded
in
a
determination
of
which
applicant
could
best
serve
the
public
interest.
which
is
the
most
qualified?
which
would
be
superior
in
its
proposal?
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
that's
true,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
your
honor,
metro
is
not
against
affirmative
action
programs
per
se,
and
we
feel
that
there
might
well
be
a
need
for
remedial
action.
however,
there's
a
couple
of
problems.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
only
congress,
justice
o'connor,
because
we
feel
that
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
only
congress,
and
uniquely
congress,
has
that
broad
kind
of
power
to
remedy
societal
discrimination.
but
again,
it
would
have
to
be
discrimination...
it's
a
constraint
against
discrimination
by
the
states,
and
it's
questionable,
even
if
congress
could
constrain--
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
--the
action
of
congress
at
best
should
be
viewed
as
an
unconstitutional
attempt
to
impose
a
remedial
action
on
the
commission
to
perpetuate
these
policies
without
any
findings
of
past
discrimination.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
well,
that's
not
a
given,
justice
o'connor,
because
as
you
have
said
in
the
croson
decision,
underrepresentation
in
and
of
itself
is
not
evidence
of
past
discrimination,
and
in
the
1987
hearings
before
congress,
in
the
1989
hearings
before
congress
regarding
minority
ownership,
it
was
made
clear
both
by
commissioners
that
testified
before
congress
and
congress
that
there
was...
that
the
underrepresentation
was
the
sole
indicia
of
the
supposed
past
discrimination.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
well,
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
only
applicable
insofar
as
congress
perceives
this
as
a
remedial
measure,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
no,
congress
is
limited
to
the
fourteenth
amendment,
we
believe,
when
it
seeks
to
redress
society-wide
discrimination.
in
wygant,
the
court
seemed
to
indicate
that
society-wide
discrimination
couldn't
be
taken
into
account
at
all,
but
subsequent
clarification
has
indicated
that
congress,
pursuant
to
that
unique
power
under
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
can
redress
society-wide
discrimination.
again,
there's
no
finding--
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice?
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
it
goes
far
enough
to...
that's
not
clear
by
the
decisions
of
this
court,
quite
honestly,
your
honor.
the
power
goes
far
enough
to
redress
society-wide
discrimination
it's
been
stated,
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
rationale
for
that
has
always
been
grounded
in
the
section
5
positive
grant
of
power
to
congress
and
the
article
1
restriction
on
the
states.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
under
bolling
v.
sharpe
and
other
cases,
yes,
your
honor.
and
that's
one
problem,
is
if
we
do
not
isolate
congress'
broader
remedial
power,
justice
kennedy,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
it
is
left
to
be
constrained
by
the
fifth
amendment
as
to
what
type
of
distinctions
it
can
impose.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
and
that
is
clear.
the
commission
testified
to
that
effect...
ronald
k.
porter
on
behalf
of
the
commission
in
september
'89,
already
after
this
court
had
granted
our
petition
for
certiorari...
that
the
fcc
has
never
adopted
remedial
rationale,
that
there's
never
been
a
finding
of
any
past
discrimination
on
the
part
of
the
agency
or
in
its
licensing
practices
or
in
any
other
way.
and
it's
clear
if
you
look
at
the
comparative
process
that
it
would
be
difficult
for
any
type
of
discrimination
to
enter
into
it,
because
the
only
criteria
that
you
have
to
have
besides
certain...
or
the
only
qualifications
you
have
to
have
besides
certain
financial
and
technical
ones,
is
local
residence,
which
is
presumed
to
serve
the
community
that
the
station
is
to
be
located
in,
civic
participation
within
the
community,
which
is
part
of
a
local
residence
background.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
your
honor,
the
fcc
has
done
exactly
the
opposite.
on
countless
occasions
they
have
stated
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
there
is
no
remedial
basis
for
the
programs
whatsoever.
we
feel
the
focus
in
this
case
needs
to
be
on
the
commission's
program
diversity
goal,
therefore,
because
under
fcc
v.
chenery,
this
court
really
we
don't
feel
should
review
a
position
that
the
commission
itself
did
not
take
in
adopting
the
program.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
actually,
i
was
just
looking
at
a
first
amendment
case,
your
honor,
that
was
before
this
court.
the
federal
communications
v.
wncn
listeners
guild,
and
this
case
is
replete
with
references
by
this
court
and
by
the
commission
that
diversity
in
the
market...
diversity
of
programming
is
assured
by
the
marketplace
and
the
operations
of
the
marketplace.
it
is
not
assured
any
other
way.
it
can
only
come
from
the
marketplace.
it's
questionable
whether
the
commission's
policies
even
promote
program
diversity,
your
honor,
a
goal
that
it
equates
with
the
first
amendment
value
of
the
widest
possible
dissemination
of
information
from
diverse
and
antagonistic
viewpoints.
despite
this
very
broad
phrasing
of
the
program
diversity
goal,
however,
the
commission's
entire
efforts
to
enhance
program
diversity
consists
of
the
enumeration
of
six
classifications.
no
other
classifications
are
recognized
as
having
any
potential
contribution
to
program
diversity.
the
views
of
gays
and
lesbians
underrepresented
obviously
in
the
media,
although
there
similarly
have
been
no
studies
on
that
fact,
are
underrepresented
in
the
media,
but
there
is
no
way
they
can
receive
credit
for
their
potential
contribution
to
program
diversity.
a
holocaust
survivor
from
the
nazi
days,
there
is
no
way.
that
person
would
potentially,
we
feel,
have
some
contribution
to
make
to
program
diversity.
there
is
no
recognition
for
that.
the
commission's
goal
does
not
seem
to
be
program
diversity--
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
--i
hope
so.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
they
are
gender,
black
ownership
and
participation,
pacific
islanders,
alaskans...
aleutians
are
really
what
is
specified
there...
asians
and
hispanics.
that's
it.
those
are
the
only
classifications
that
are
recognized
as
having
an
impact
on
program
diversity,
and
there
is
no
way
to
assure
that
other
groups
that
have
been
hitherto
unrecognized
would
have
access
or
potential
contributions
to
diversity
under--
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
--the
commission
has...
your
honor,
this
is
a
key
point
in
the
case,
we
feel.
the
diversification
of
control
factor,
that's
the
predominant
consideration,
and
we
feel
that
program
diversity
is
really
just
a
muddled
restatement
of
this
diversification
criterion.
the
diversification
criterion
which
is
intended
to
diffuse
control
in
the
media
of
mass
communications
by
limiting
the
number
of
stations
someone
can
own
is
said
to
be
grounded
in
the
supposition
that
perhaps
this
will
result
in
a
greater
degree
of
programming,
a
greater
variety
of
programming.
now
this
court
has
acknowledged--
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
--pardon
me?
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
we
don't
agree
with
that
notion
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
we
feel...
we
feel
that
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor,
and
it's
even
more
correct
now
than
it
ever
was
before
because
there
are
more
stations
and
more
sources
of
information
and
viewpoints
to
the
public
than
there
have
ever
been
before,
from
cable
television
to
wireless
transmissions
to
satellite
dishes.
there
is
more
diversity.
there
are
more
sources
for
possible
diversity
than
there
has
ever
been
before.
so
we
feel
that,
really,
program
diversity
is
a
misnomer.
what
the
commission
is
trying
to
do,
which
justice
powell
had
insinuated
in
bakke
and
subsequent
cases
it
was
not
permissible,
is
simply
to
prefer
one
or
actually
six
groups
over
any
other
possible
groups.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
well,
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
well,
we
feel
that
they
were,
your
honor.
congress,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
specifically
said
in
the
appropriations
legislation...
if
the
legislative
history
is
read
and
the
conference
report
is
read,
congress
said
that
we
are
doing
this
in
order
to
promote
diversification
of
ownership.
i
am
convinced,
your
honor,
that
congress'
ratification
of
the
fcc's
policy
is
based
on
its
belief
that
the
fcc
in
comparative
licensing
proceedings
is
considering
race
under
the
diversification
criterion.
it
is
clear
in
this
brief
filed
by
the
united
states
senate
in
this
proceeding,
the
amicus
brief,
that
congress
does
not
understand
either
the
operation
of
the
commission's
processes
and
the
various
components
in
it
or
where
this
recognition
of
minority
and
female
ownership
was
placed.
contrary
to
being
of
the
notion
that
it's
a
considered
decision
of
congress
based
on
its
broader
mission
to
investigate
all
facts,
which
the
senate
and
the
fcc
cite
as
relevant,
all
evidence
in
this
proceeding
shows
that
congress
didn't
even
know
what
was
going
on
with
respect
to
the
minority
and
female
enhancement
policies.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
sure,
and
we
don't
deny--
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
--and
we
don't
deny
that
congress
generally
or
even
all
the
time
makes
their
decisions
on
that
basis,
but
we
need
to
look
closer
when
we
find
that
they're
making
decisions
that
impose
race,
ethnic
and
gender-based
classifications
upon
society
in
violation
of
the
equal
protection
principles.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
there
have
to
be
findings.
even
fullilove
required
narrow
tailoring.
not
the
extensive--
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
--no,
your
honor,
out
of
fullilove.
in
fullilove
it
was
deemed
important,
and
great,
great
amount
of
talk
was
given
to
the...
to
what
congress
did
in
deciding
to
pass
the
program
that
was
under
review
there.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
well,
your
honor,
we've
been
talking
about
the
remedial
basis
for
the...
for
the
legislation,
and
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
remedial
basis
how
can
there
be
no
findings
if
there's
something
that
needs
to
be
remedied?
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
well,
your
honor,
that
is
not
the
standard
that
was
enunciated
by
this
course
in
fullilove...
this
court
in
fullilove
for
reviewing
race
and
ethnic-based
classifications
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we
feel
that--
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
--i...
i...
i
do
think
that
it
has
been
read
too
broadly
by
the
commission
and
the
amici
in
this
case.
their
briefs
stop
at
the
point
where
they
under...
where
they
see
that
congress
has
acted,
and
they
think
the
mere
presence
of
congressional
action
is
enough
to
give
up
the
inquiry.
but
what
we're
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
even
under
fullilove
there's
a
two-prong
test,
whether
the
objectives
of
the
legislation
are
within
congress'
power,
and
justice
kennedy
referred
to
the
commerce
clause
as
being
one
possible
basis
for
the
exercise
of
that
power;
but
second,
whether
the
limited
use
of
racial
and
ethnic
criteria
are
a
permissible
means
for
congress
to
carry
out
its
objectives
within
the
due
process
clause.
this
program
is
not
narrowly
tailored,
and,
significantly
enough,
underrepresentation
is
all
congress
refers
to
as
evidence
that
there
is
a
problem.
and
underrepresentation
is
not
enough
but,
more
importantly
in
the
present
case,
you
must
realize
that
the
commission's
policies
were
in
effect
18
years
when
congress
supposedly
ratified
them.
if
anything,
the
continuing
existence
of
the
underrepresentation
statistic
demonstrates
that
the
commission's
comparative
preference
policies
is
a
complete
and
total
failure
in
advancing
either
minority
ownership
or
diversity
of
programming,
and
when
reviewing
what
information
congress
had
before
it
at
that
time,
that
must
be
taken
into
account,
that
the
record
is
that
the
policies
were
bad,
ineffective
and
unconstitutional.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
could.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
oh,
my
gosh.
yes,
your
honor.
a
couple
of
important
points
in
that
two
minutes,
mr.
chief
justice
and
other
members
of
the
court:
the
commission
here
is
caught
in
a
grave
and
painful
vice
between
content
regulation
and
stereotyping
with
the
program
diversity
rationale.
if
the
commission
is
wrong
and
minority
ownership
or
female
ownership
does
not
result
in
a
different
kind
of
programming,
then
the
commission
is
engaged
in
impermissible
stereotyping
based
on
predictions
of
what
a
particular
person
will
do
in
a
particular
occasion
on
account
of
their
blood.
on
the
other
hand,
assuming
the
commission
is
right
and
that
we
can
make
accurate
predictive
judgments
about
a
person's
behavior
based
upon
their
race,
then
that
means
that
the
commission,
by
selecting
these
groups,
knowing
that
their
behavior
is
going
to
be
a
certain
way,
is
seeking
a
content
objective.
they
want
the
type
of
content
that
they
believe
it
can
be
identified
by
these
racial
and
sexual
characteristics.
so
either
it's
stereotyping
or
it's
content
regulation,
but
it's
not
permissible.
the
second
point,
your
honor,
is
that
again
both
the
commission
and
rainbow
now
are
speaking
in
terms
of
a
diversification
rationale
for
the
program.
that
is
not
the
rationale.
the
rationale
is
program
diversity.
the
commission
has
a
diversification
criterion.
if
it
was
truly
the
rationale
they
could
incorporate
a
race
neutral
preference
under
the
diversification
rationale
and
say
if
a
hitherto
prejudiced-against
or
discriminated-against
group
wants
to
enter
the
media
and
they
can
show
some
past
discrimination
or
show
that
they
have
been
denied
access,
we
will
give
them
a
preference.
we
won't
specify
what
the
groups
are.
why
did
the
commission
have
to
specify
those
groups,
and
why
are
those
groups
exclusive
of
a
list
of
program
diversity?
third,
these
policies
have
no
end.
they
will
continue
to
operate
until
this
proportional
underrepresentation
is
gone.
in
the
last
18
years,
minority
ownership
has
only
increased
1
percent.
i
am
no
mathematician,
but
it
would
appear
that
we
have
600
years
left
of
the
commission's
minority
and
female
preferences
based
on
proportional
equal
representation.
mr.
gregory
h.
guillot
your
honor,
given
the
appropriations
acts,
we
will
never
know
even
what
the
commission's
true
viewpoint
is
because
the
commission
has
been
statutorily
restricted
to
express
only
one
view
regarding
the
policies,
and
that
is
a
pro-constitutional
one.
