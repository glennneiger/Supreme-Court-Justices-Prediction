chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
89-453,
metro
broadcasting,
inc.
v.
federal
communications
commission.
mr.
guillot.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we...
we
don't
ordinarily
want
to
give
sweeping
decisions
if
they
don't
affect
your
particular
case.
are
you
saying
that
it
would
be
sufficient
for
your
case
to
decide
solely
the
minority
preference
and
not
the
female
preference?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
guillot?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
congress'
power
under
section
5
goes
further
than
to
redress
discrimination
caused
by
states,
who
are
the
ones
that
are
subject
to
the
fourteenth
amendment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
congress
itself
is
limited
by
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
are...
what
are
the
six
classifications?
can
they
be
shortly
stated?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
do,
too.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
what...
what
other
standards
for
program
diversity
does
the
commission
have,
i
mean
other...
other
than
the
minority
aspect?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
guillot.
mr.
armstrong.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
assumption
of
the
commission,
i
take
it,
is
that
if
there
are
more
minority
owners,
there
will
be
more
diversity
in
the
airwaves?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i...
i
was
asking
you
if...
if
that
was
the
commission's
assumption.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
is...
is...
what
is
the
reasoning
behind
that
so
far
as
the
commission
is
concerned?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
to...
to
say
at
the
time
that
the
tv
9
decision
came
down
in
1973
or
whenever
it
was
that
you
can't...
you're
not
certain
about
how
to
validate
predictive
judgment,
but
after
18
years
i
would
think
it
would
not
longer
be
a
predictive
judgment.
you...
you've
had
experience
that
you
could
evaluate.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
armstrong.
ms.
polivy.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
polivy,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
first
amendment
requires
the
fcc's
diversification
program?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
this
court
has
held
that
the
fcc
must...
the
first
amendment
requires
the
fcc
to
follow
a
diversification--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
but
what
is
an
appropriate
first
amendment
finding?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
now
that's
quite
different,
to
say
that
the
commission
sees
that
as
its
function
under
the
communications
act
and
that
this
court
has
upheld
its
seeing
it
that
way.
that's
different
than
saying
that
if
the
communications
act
did
not
provide
for
it,
the
commission
would
nonetheless
have
to
do
it
because
of
the
first
amendment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
i
don't,
either.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
polivy.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
guillot,
do
you
have
any
rebuttal?
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
guillot.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
89-700,
astroline
communications
company
v.
shurberg
broadcasting.
mr.
wollenberg,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--mr....
mr.
wollenberg,
a
moment
ago
you
read
some
language
from
a
senate
report
in
connection
with...
was
it
a
1982
act
of
congress?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what
did
that
act
provide,
so
far
as
minority
preferences
was
concerned?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
is
that
what
was...
what
was
involved
in
this
particular
case
before
us?
did
the
commission--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--was
the
distress
sale
policy
similarly
authorized
by
congress?
chief
justice
rehnquist
congress
cut
off
funding
for
the
commission's
effort
to
reconsider
the
policy.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but...
but
nothing
before
us
in
this
particular
case
depends
on
the
lottery
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
from
which
you
read
the
history?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wollenberg.
mr.
cole.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
cole,
would
you
have
had
an
opportunity
at
some
stage
in
the
fcc
proceedings
to
challenge
the
status
of
mr.
ramirez
as
being
a
hispanic
had
you
chosen
to
do
so?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
had
you
been
able
to
dig
up
something,
you
might
have
had
an
opportunity
to
challenge.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
not
saying
that
certain
types,
whether
it
be,
you
know,
hispanics,
white,
upper-middle
class,
blacks,
don't
like
certain
kinds
of
programs,
but
you're
saying
they
could
be
provided
by
people
who
aren't
necessarily
of
that...
of
that
group?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
if
it
were...
supposing
it
weren't
a
presumption.
suppose
you
went
out
and
took
a
survey
of
an
area
which
was,
say,
very
much
majority
black
and
the
response
of
those
people
was
we
all...
or,
say,
85
percent
of
them
say
we
want
soul
music,
we
want
rap,
something
like
that.
now,
if
that
isn't
being
provided
at
all
in
that
community,
could
the
commission
take
that
into
consideration?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
saying
that
the
government
cannot
take
those
factors
into
account?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
there's...
that
there's...
take
a
community
in
the
southwest
and
take
justice
scalia's
hypothesis
where
there's
an
actual
survey
that...
and
it
happens
to
be
largely
hispanic,
that
there
are
100,000
people
there,
80,000
of
them
prefer
mariachi
bands
and
there's
no
station
providing
mariachi
bands.
can't
the
fcc
make
some
requirement
that
the
station
provide
mariachi
bands?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
could
put
in
some
condition
that
an
applicant,
at
least
be
favored...
if
it,
regardless
of
who
the
applicant
was,
if
it
would
be
put
in
some
mariachi
band
music?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cole.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
wollenberg,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
the
minority
set
aside
program
made
no
difference
in
the
outcome
of
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i
said,
did
it
make
any
difference
in
the
outcome
of
this
case,
of
the
award
of
this
franchise?
chief
justice
rehnquist
couldn't
you
answer
my
question
a
yes
or
a
no?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
are
you
saying
that
the
commission's
minority
set-aside
policy
and
distress
case
sales
made
no
difference
in
the
outcome
of
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wollenberg.
the
case
is
submitted.
