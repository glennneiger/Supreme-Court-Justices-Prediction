justice
white
do
you...
do
you--
justice
white
--on...
on
diversification?
justice
white
and
we
shouldn't
even
address,
i
suppose...
at
least
we
shouldn't
accept
any
submission
that
this
program
is...
is
justifiable
based
on
a
remedial
basis?
justice
white
we
can't...
we
can't...
if
you
didn't
rely
on
it,
we
shouldn't
accept
any
submission
based
on
the
remedy.
justice
white
yeah,
but
that
isn't
what
the
fcc
has
done.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
all
congress
said
that
here's...
that
you
don't
want
to
change...
that
it
didn't
want
you
to
change
your...
your
preference
policy.
stay
with
it.
and,
as
i
understand
you
to
explain
what
your
policy
was
and
is,
it's
purely
diversification--
justice
white
--i
know,
but
congress
didn't
change...
congress
didn't
change
the
basis
that...
on
which
you're
acting.
justice
white
well,
you've
been
acting
on
a
diversification
basis--
justice
white
--not
a
race
remedy
basis.
justice
white
well,
are
there
some
signs
in
the
cable
industry?
justice
white
no,
i
mean...
i
mean
not...
not
on
the
minority
basis,
but
are
there
set-asides
for
local
stations
or
local
channels
or--
justice
white
--but
there
used
to
be?
justice
white
were
those
unconstitutional
do
you
think?
justice
white
well,
you
were
talking
about
music
stations.
justice
white
i
would
hope
that
they
improved
the
station
immensely.
justice
white
did
you
finish
what
you
wanted
to
say
about
the
fact
that
this
client
of
your
friend
here
wouldn't
have
been
considered
in
any
event?
justice
white
why
didn't
that
serve
to
disqualify
him
completely,
without
even
getting
to
any
of
the--
justice
white
--but
he
didn't
lose...
his
client...
your
opposition
didn't
lose
on
that
basis,
i
guess.
justice
white
well,
on
that
basis
we
shouldn't
have
taken
the
case.
is
that
it?
justice
white
you're
the
plaintiff...
i
mean,
you're
the
petitioner
in
this
case
and
you
didn't
raise
any
of
this
in
your
petition.
