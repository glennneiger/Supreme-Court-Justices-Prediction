justice
o'connor
mr.
guillot,
it
is
true,
i
suppose
that
very
few
licenses
are
owned
by
people
of
minority
race.
justice
o'connor
and
perhaps
the
situation
is
such
that
it
would
justify
some
remedial
action.
is
that
possible?
do
you
think
that
the
situation
might
be
such
that
it
would
be...
it
would
meet
the
wygant
test,
for
example,
for
some
kind
of
remedial
action?
justice
o'connor
then
who
could
take
that
action?
the
congress
or
the
fcc
or
both?
justice
o'connor
well,
congress
took
some
kind
of
action
here.
how
should
we
view
the
action
that
congress
took?
justice
o'connor
should
we...
should
we
take
it
as
a
given,
then,
that
congress
was
acting
to
achieve
remedial
ends?
justice
o'connor
has
the
fcc
ever
concluded
that
their...
that
a
prima
facie
case,
at
least,
exists
to
show
some
discrimination
in
the
allocation
of
licenses
in
the
past?
justice
o'connor
well,
has
the
fcc
ever
assessed
whether
broadcasting
does
present
presently
diverse
viewpoints?
justice
o'connor
well,
can...
can...
can
non-minority
owners
offer
programs
of
a
diverse
nature?
justice
o'connor
and
can
the
fcc
take
action
to
evaluate
the
extent
to
which
that
is
now
being
done?
justice
o'connor
has
the
fcc
assessed
the
extent
to
which
the
broadcasting
today
presents
diverse
viewpoints?
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
has
it
or
hasn't
it?
justice
o'connor
and
if
it
can't
be
done,
then
how
do
you
ever
evaluate
whether
the
remedy
you
have
prescribed
has
been
met.
i
mean--
justice
o'connor
--it
puts
us
in
quite
a
dilemma.
justice
o'connor
mr.
wollenberg,
do
you
think
congress
acted
under
its
fourteenth
amendment,
section
5
powers
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
it
perhaps
acted
under
its
commerce
clause
powers?
justice
o'connor
and
i
suppose
even
congress
is
bound
by
the
equal
protection
component
of
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess...
i
guess
the
fcc,
at
least,
stands
before
us
on
the
premise
that
it's
furthering
a
goal
of
program
diversity.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
i
heard
a
spokesman
for
the
fcc
at
oral
argument
in
the
preceding
case
tell
us
that
the
fcc
did
not
rely
on
some
remedial
program
for
prior
discrimination,
that
we
should
take
this
case
on
the
basis
that
the
goal
of
the
fcc
set-aside
here
and
in
the
multiple
factor
policy
in
the
preceding
case
was
to
achieve
better
program
diversity
through
minority
ownership.
now,
i
thought
that
was
how
we
took
the
case.
you
say
that
isn't
so?
justice
o'connor
does
the
fcc
policy
require
more
than
examining
the
surname
to
see
if
it's
hispanic?
justice
o'connor
so
someone
could...
a
woman
could
marry
an
hispanic
and
pick
up
an
hispanic
surname
and
qualify
under
the
fcc
policy?
justice
o'connor
well,
of
course,
the
court
has
recognized
the
need
and
the
possibility
of
some
remedial
action
for
past
discrimination
or
for,
in
some
cases,
prima
facie
evidence
of
such
discrimination.
now,
is
that
a
possibility
that
that
is
what
underlay
the
policy
in
this
case?
