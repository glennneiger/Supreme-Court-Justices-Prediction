justice
scalia
excuse
me,
mr.--
justice
scalia
--excuse
me,
mr.
guillot.
justice
scalia
is...
is...
is
it
clear
that
the
gender-based
issue
is
necessarily
before
us
here?
justice
scalia
you
wouldn't
win
if
we
just
found
the
racial
preferences
invalid?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
scalia
you...
you
mean
it's
clear
that
the
commission
would
have
reached
the
same
result
had
it
not
given
your
opponent
the
racial
preference?
is
that
clear?
justice
scalia
well,
if
that's
not
clear
then
we
can't
affirm
the
commission's
decision
if
we
invalidate
the
racial
preference;
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
confusing
at
all.
it's...
it
was
a
central
part
of
their
decision,
and
if
that's
invalid
their
decision
cannot
stand.
it
will
have
to
be
remanded.
now
they
may
on
the
remand
apply
the
sexual
preference
and
come
to
the
same
result,
but
a
remand
would
still
be
necessary.
justice
scalia
you...
you
don't
really
agree
with
that
anyway?
justice
scalia
you
don't
really
agree
with
that
policy,
either,
because
you
just
said
a
little
time
ago
that...
that,
in
fact,
the
programming
will
be
determined
by
what
makes
money.
these
are
all
profit
stations
we're
talking
about
here,
right?
justice
scalia
so
the...
the
evil
of
having
one
person
own
it
is
probably
not...
not
an
evil
of
not
having
diverse
viewpoints
but
an
evil
of...
of
restricting
advertising
rates
or
things
of
that
sort?
justice
scalia
the
fc...
the
fcc
and
the
licensed
companies
suggest
that
this
policy
is
not
just
any
more
a
commission
policy,
that
it's
been
adopted
by
congress.
justice
scalia
we
don't
know
the
basis
on
which
congress
adopted
it,
do
we?
maybe
congress
was
using
it
for
some
purpose
other
than
diversity.
justice
scalia
we...
we
enforce
congressional
statutes
whether
they
knew
what
was
going
on
or
not.
[laughter]
if
they...
if
they
write
a
statute,
it
has
independent
operative
effect,
doesn't
it?
they
don't
even--
justice
scalia
--read
about
it.
each
of
them
can
work
at
home
and
come
in
and
vote
on
the
basis
of
his
own
research.
they
don't
have
to
have
a
committee
meeting,
do
they?
justice
scalia
xxx
categories
congress
has
to
make
a
record,
is
that
it?
it's
sort
of
a
due
process,
a
due
legislative
process?
justice
scalia
where
do
you
get
that?
out
of
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
scalia
congress
cannot...
cannot
enact
a
valid
piece
of
legislation
in
this
field
without
making
findings?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
scalia
we
can,
as
we
often
do
with
legislation,
see
whether
there
is
a
plausible
basis
for
the
legislation
but
without
demanding
what
the
constitution
does
not
require,
that
congress
give
reasons
for
its
legislation.
it
doesn't
have
to
give
reasons
for
its
legislation.
justice
scalia
you
read
it
too
broad.
justice
scalia
you
would
concede
that
if
the
court
should
find
against
you
on
the
racial
portion,
we
would
have
to
set
aside
the
commission's
action
here?
justice
scalia
let
me
understand
what
you
mean.
you...
you...
you
mean
the
nexus
between
race
and
expression,
the
thing...
that
white
people
think
and
express
themselves
one
way
and
aleutians
another
way
and
asians
another
way
and...
i
thought
this
was
what
we
were
trying
to
get
away
from.
justice
scalia
the
harvard
plan
was
adopted
long
before
black
admissions
were
an
issue,
and
many
thought
that
the
reasons
for
its
adoption
was
to...
was
to
eliminate
the
excessive
number
of
jewish
students
who
were
getting
admitted
on
a
purely
merit
basis.
justice
scalia
so,
i...
i'm
not
very
impressed
with--
justice
scalia
mr.
armstrong,
how
do
you...
how
do
you
pick
out
these...
these
particular
minorities?
i
mean,
if
i
had...
somebody
had
said,
you
know,
get...
get
a
group
of
minorities
that...
that
would
produce
diverse
programming,
you
know,
i
would
have
thought
maybe
southern
baptists
and
ethical
humanists
and
perhaps
homosexual
groups,
groups
that...
that...
that
have
some
difference
in...
in...
in
their
ideas,
in...
in...
in
what
ideas
they
consider
important.
how
did
you
come
up
with
these
groups
which
are
what,
blacks
and
hispanics,
but
not
portuguese?
they...
they
have
been
excluded
from
your
definition
of
a
hispanic,
right?
justice
scalia
yes.
justice
scalia
oh,
i
see.
justice
scalia
how
were
the
groups
determined?
by
blood?
i
mean,
a
hispanic
would...
what
degree
of
blood
does
one
have
to
be
to
qualify?
justice
scalia
well,
wait.
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
diversity
of
viewpoint?
i
thought
you
said
it
was
not
remedial?
justice
scalia
you
identified
the
groups
on
the
basis
of
a
remedial
theory
in
order
to
achieve
a
diversity
objective.
is
that
what's
been
done?
justice
scalia
i
see.
so,
it
really--
--i
just
want
to
make
it
clear.
you
do
not...
you
do
not
seek
to
justify
this
program
based
on
racial
discrimination
and
as...
as
to
trying
to
remedy
past
discrimination?
justice
scalia
i
thought
we're
all
trying
to
make
money
when
we...
when
we
buy
a
for-profit
radio
or
television
station.
justice
scalia
and
i
thought
that
the
smarter
we
all
are
we
will
all
try
to
make
money
in
exactly
the
same
way,
and
if
we're
an
asian
broadcasting
in
a
hispanic
community,
we
will
broadcast
hispanic
programming,
just
as
we
would
if
we
were
a
white
broadcasting
in
a
hispanic
community.
justice
scalia
what
evidence...
what
evidence
can
you
refer
to
that
demonstrates
that
individuals
of
any
of
these
particular
race,
or
of
any
race
for
that
matter,
will
produce
programming
of
a
particular
racial
type?
justice
scalia
i
thought
the
concept
was
also,
however,
that
people's
voices...
that
is,
their
ideas...
are
not
to
be
judged
on
the
basis
of
their
skin.
isn't
that
a
concept
that
underlies
the
constitution,
too?
justice
scalia
but
that's
exactly
what
you're
saying.
justice
scalia
you're
saying
that
if
you
have
black
owners
you
will
have
black
programming,
whatever
that
means.
justice
scalia
a
black
who
gets
a
minority
preference
here
could
have
been
born
and
raised
in
scarsdale;
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
you're
saying
our
background,
where
we
come
from.
it
has
to
do
with
nothing
here
except
blood;
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
isn't
blood
what
counts?
justice
scalia
what
counts
for
purposes
of
whether
the
preference
is
given?
is
it
anything
other
than
blood?
justice
scalia
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
scalia
but
the
only
statute
that
congress
passed
that
has
to
do
with
this
case
is
an
appropriations
act.
justice
scalia
and
the
only
law
of
congress
that
binds
us
here
is
the
law
that
says
the
fcc
won't
use
any
funds
in
each
of
these
annual
appropriations...
and
the
current
one
has
the
same
thing,
i
gather...
in
order
to
consider
this
policy.
that's
the
only
formal
expression
of
congress'
view,
in
law,
that
we
have.
justice
scalia
when
was
the
kerner
commission
report?
justice
scalia
about
20
years
ago.
since
which
time
the
fcc
has
been
on
the
other
side
of
this
issue,
right?
justice
scalia
which
is
why
congress
passed
the
appropriations?
justice
scalia
mr.
wollenberg,
could
i...
let
me
tell
you
the
thing
that...
that
most
troubles
me
about
this
case.
and
maybe
you
can
tell
me
how
we
can
distinguish
it
from
other
situations.
if
we
accept
in
this
case
the
legitimacy
of
making
a
prediction
about
a
person's
action
on
the
basis
of
his
or
her
blood,
what
other
fields
of
public
policy
may
we
use
that
kind
of
a
presumption
in?
i
know
of
no
other
area
where
we've
allowed
it
to
be
done.
to
say
on...
not
as
a
remedial
matter,
but
on
the
basis
of
predicting
behavior,
if
a
person
is
of
a
certain
blood,
he
will
put
on
a
certain
programming.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
field
where
we've
done
that.
now,
how
can...
if
we
adopt
such
a
principle,
and
say
that
is
legitimate
for
congress
or
the
fcc
or
anybody
to
do
that,
what
other
fields
might...
might
we
do
that
in?
or
why
might
we
not
do
it
in
other
fields,
as
well?
justice
scalia
and--
justice
scalia
--i'm
not
worried
about
proving
it,
i'm
worried
about
extending
that
principle
to
other
fields.
justice
scalia
and
i'd
like
you
to
tell
me
how
it
can
be
limited
to
this
one
field,
once
we
accept
that
congress
may
predict
human
behavior
on
the
basis
of
human
blood--
justice
scalia
--for
this
purpose,
why
may
not
it
do
it
for
other
purposes?
justice
scalia
tell
me
how
it's
going
to
help
to
announce
that,
yes,
indeed
race
does
make
a
difference,
that
you
can
indeed
predict
how
people
will
act
on
the
basis
of
their
blood,
that's
going
to
help
the
situation
of
racism
that
you're
concerned
about.
justice
scalia
blood,
mr.
wollenberg,
blood,
not
background
and
environment,
isn't
that
right?
it
doesn't
matter
where
the
person
of
that
race
was
raised,
in
the
most
privileged
family
in
the
most
exclusive
residential
community.
blood.
justice
scalia
so
it's
determined
on
the
basis
of
dissent,
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
what...
what
if
your...
one
of
your
great
grandparents
was
hispanic.
is
that
enough?
justice
scalia
there
must
be
some
rules
about
that,
mustn't
there?
what
degree
of...
of...
of
the
race
you
have
to
be
in
order
to
qualify?
justice
scalia
there's
some
reason
to
think
that
republicans
and
democrats
thinking
differently,
isn't
there?
justice
scalia
mr.
cole,
would
you
have
an
objection
to
this
if
the
commission
had
set
it
up
a
different
way,
that
there
is
a
preference
for,
let's
say,
people
who
are
leaders
in
hispanic
cultural
affairs,
whether
they're
hispanic
or
not
or
a
preference
for
people
who've
taken
particular
interest
and
done
particular
study
in
black
history?
justice
scalia
would
it
be
objectionable
at
all--
justice
scalia
--and
it
would
be
more
likely
to
have
a
direct
effect
on
what
the
programming
would
be,
wouldn't
it,
than
just...
just
the
race
of
the
person?
justice
scalia
but
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
this
policy
is
that
at
all?
justice
scalia
i
think
your
argument
is
really...
i
just
think
it's
not
true
if...
if
you're
saying
that
there
are
not
some
generalizations
that
could
be
made
validly
if
you
wanted
and
were
permitted
to
make
the
generalizations.
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
a
higher
percentage
of
one
group
would
like
a
certain
percent...
kind
of
programming
than
another.
i
had
thought
your
point
is
that
that
is
simply
the
kind
of
a
generalization
that
our
government
is
not
allowed
to
make.
we
can't
send
people
to
school
on
that
basis.
we
can't
program
on
that
basis.
we
cannot
make
racial
generalizations.
if
that
isn't
your
point,
i
think...
and
you're
going
to
argue
it
on
the
basis
of
probabilities,
you
know,
i'd
say
it's
maybe
not
a
high
probability,
but
if
you
pick
somebody
with
a
hispanic
surname,
you
know,
60/40
they
would
like
mariachi
bands.
i
don't
know.
justice
scalia
if
i
had
to
bet
on
it,
that's
how
i'd
put
my
money.
justice
scalia
because
the
market
takes
care
of
it,
but
before
it
came
to
that...
that...
that
conclusion,
it
had
indeed
licensed
stations
on
basis
of
format.
justice
scalia
what
kind
of...
you
know,
different
kind
of
music;
indeed,
different
degrees
of
rap...
of
rock
music.
i
forget
how
many
there
were.
but
it
used
to
do
that,
right?
justice
scalia
but
not
on
the
basis
of
race,
just
on
the
basis
of
the
kind
of
programming
that
was
promised.
