ms.
margaret
polivy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
four
times
in
the
last
12
years
this
court
has
had
occasion
to
consider
the
constitutionality
of
government
programs
involving
race
conscious...
or
ethnic
conscious-based
decisions
as
selection
criteria.
under
the
holdings
of
each
of
those
cases,
we
submit
that
the
fcc's
comparative
minority
preference
policy
should
be
sustained.
bakke
and
the
issues
addressed
in
there...
in
that
case
by
justice
powell
most
closely
resemble
the
issues
presented
here
today.
both
cases
involve
as
a
compelling
governmental
interest
the
diversity
of
voices
contributing
to
robust
debate
among
the
audience.
in
the
case
of
bakke,
we're
talking
about
a
student
body.
in
the
case
of
the
fcc,
we're
talking
about
everyone
in
the
nation.
the
root
of
the
fcc's
regulatory
power
in
this
area
lies
in
the
first
amendment
guarantee
that
multiple
voices
produce
the
most
informed
electorate.
what
is
involved
here
is
the
fcc's
attempt
and
congress'
ratification
of
that
attempt--
ms.
margaret
polivy
--your
honor,
the...
this
court
and
many
others
and
congress
have
had
occasion
over
the
years,
starting
with
the
associated
press
case
and
going
unbroken
for
almost
50
years,
of
acknowledging
the
fact
that
the
first
amendment
is
certainly
part
of
the
commission's
requirement
to
diversify
the
ownership
of
broadcasting,
and
it's
through
the
ownership
of
broadcasting
that
editorial
control
takes
place.
ms.
margaret
polivy
i
think
the
question
would
come
up
in
the...
in
the
reverse,
that
the
fcc's
foundation,
reliance
upon
the
first
amendment
as
part
of
its
reason
for
diversity,
is
an
appropriate
first
amendment
finding.
i
would
refer
you
to
the
court's
opinion
in
red
lion.
ms.
margaret
polivy
well,
that
diversification
is
part
of
the
first
amendment,
that
the
multiplicity
of
tongues
and
the
encouragement
of
diversity
in
the
control
of
media
is
something
that
the
commission
properly
sees
as
its
function
under
the
communications
act
and
under
the
first
amendment.
ms.
margaret
polivy
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
said
that.
i
think
the--
ms.
margaret
polivy
--i
think
the
court
has
said
that
this
is
consistent
with
the
commission's
obligation
both
to
further
the
first
amendment
and
the
communications
act,
and
i
think
that's
all
that
i'm
claiming
there.
but
that
the
court's
holding
in
bakke
that
diversity
of
viewpoint
is
a
compelling
state
interest
in
the
academic
field
would
certainly
be
as
valid
or
more
valid
in
the
area
of
broadcasting
where
you're
talking
about
the
entire
nation.
the...
some
of
the
confusion,
i
think,
perhaps
as
to
the
purpose
is
caused
by
the
fact
that
the
commission's
justification
of
the
race-conscious
criteria
that
it
is
using
stems
from
the
fact
that
in
seeking
diversity
of
viewpoint
they
first
identified
the
missing
voices.
to
that
extent,
one
would
have
to
say
that
it
is...
if
there
was
no
past
deprivation
or
exclusion
there
would
be
no
need
to
look
specifically
to
include
those
people.
so
it's
somewhat
difficult
to
separate
the
remedial
from
the
question
of
diversity
of
viewpoint
and...
and
ownership
that
the
commission
is
talking
about.
ms.
margaret
polivy
justice
kennedy,
the...
the
underlying
rationale
of
the...
the
policy
is
that
the
people
who
are
to
benefit
from
the
inclusion
of
multiple
voices
are
not
the
minority
groups
involved
but
the
population
as
a
whole.
ms.
margaret
polivy
the
way
it
works
is
very
simply
there
is
no
consideration
given
to
whether
this
is
an
asian
population
or
a
hispanic
population.
the
underlying
theory
is
that--
ms.
margaret
polivy
--no,
sir.
the...
the
underlying
theory
is
that
everyone
benefits
from
hearing
a
multiplicity
of
voices.
we
are
not
talking
here
about
specialized
programming.
we
are
talking
about
differences
of
perspective,
differences
of
choices
made
in
editorial
control,
differences
made
in
choice
of
news,
in
choice
of
programs,
in
choice...
the
whole
theory
is
that
the
reflections
that
each
of
us
bring
to
ownership
are
a
product
of
our
background,
are
a
product
of
our
uniqueness.
when
there
are
identifiable
groups,
such
as
there
are
here
that
have
been
excluded
from
broadcasting,
what
we're
talking
about
here--
ms.
margaret
polivy
--well,
we're
not--
ms.
margaret
polivy
--the
air
waves
are
a
public
domain,
and
broadcasters
are
public
trustees.
while
stations
may
in
fact
make
money,
and
certainly
we
have
heard
a
great
deal
about
that,
that
is
not
a
standard
by
which
the
licenses
are
allocated.
it
is
not
a
standard
by
which
licenses
are
awarded.
those
seeking
licenses
must
demonstrate
their
intention
to
serve
the
public
interest,
not
the
public
coffer.
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
question
of
who
determines
what
goes
out
over
the
air
waves,
who
determines
whether
a
program
on
apartheid
is
to
be
shown
or
not,
who
determines
whether
an
editorial
is
to
be
run
about
a
local
election.
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
ms.
margaret
polivy
there
have
been
some
studies,
and
in
the
brief
filed
by
the
naacp
there...
there
is
a
footnote
that
extensively
refers
to
them,
but
that
is
not
the
point.
the
point
here
is
that
the...
the
concept
that
underlies
the
first
amendment,
the
concept
that
underlies
our
democracy
is
that
a
multiplicity
of
voices
give
rise
to
a
multiplicity
of
views,
and
it
is
true
that--
ms.
margaret
polivy
--certainly,
it
is,
and
we
are
not
saying
that
the
content
of
their
voices
underlies
the--
ms.
margaret
polivy
--i
think--
ms.
margaret
polivy
--i
am
not
saying
that.
in
fact,
what
i
am
saying
is
quite
the
reverse.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
insofar
as
we
each
are
a
product
of
our
backgrounds,
our
unique
experiences
bring
our
unique
choices.
now
that
is
not
the
color
of
our
skins,
but
it
is
a
fact
that
we
all
come
from
different
places.
and
it
is
the
fact
that
we
come
from
different
places
that
leads
to
the
panoply
of
views
and
voices.
there
is
no
such
thing
as
an
american
voice.
we
are
each
the
product
of
our
backgrounds.
ms.
margaret
polivy
certainly.
ms.
margaret
polivy
no,
it--
ms.
margaret
polivy
--it
has--
ms.
margaret
polivy
--well,
if
you...
if
you
mean
belonging
to
a
group
by
blood--
ms.
margaret
polivy
--i
would
say
yes.
however,
what
it
does
mean
is
it's
the
recognition
in
the
first
amendment...
in
the
commission's
view
that
this
is
a
different
perspective.
whether
you
were
born
in
scarsdale
or
you
were
born
in
harlem,
the
fact
of
who
you
are
is
what
contributes
to
your
perspective.
ms.
margaret
polivy
well,
it
may
be
your
ethnicity.
it
may
be
your
background,
but
what
we
have
done
here
is
identify
those
groups
that
have
been
excluded
from
the
mass
media.
when
the
commission
started
this
program
in
1978,
fully
only
1
percent
of
the
broadcast
outlets
in
this
country
were
owned
by
minority
individuals.
today
after
18
years...
12
years,
the
latest
figures
that
we
have
in
the
congressional
research
study
is
that
3.5
percent
of
all
broadcast
outlets
are
owned
by
minority
individuals.
i'd
like
to
just
address
one
or
two
things
that
have
been
alluded
to.
the
first
is
that
the
minority
enhancement
that
the
commission
gives
is
one
of
a
number
of
multiple
factors.
it
is
by
no
means
a
decision
factor.
in
fact,
in
this
case
rainbow
did
not
win
simply
because
it
got
a
minority
preference.
it
proposed
a
larger
amount
of
qualitative
integration,
more
of
its
ownership
was
to
be
integrated
into
the
management,
and
it
was
given
credit
for
its
past
broadcast
experience.
the
commission
considers
multiple
factors
in
addition
to
simply
whether
or
not
people
are
going
to
be
integrated.
the
commission
considers
whether
or
not
the
proposals
are
technically
advantageous.
the
commission
considers
whether
there
are
any
other
stations
owned.
the
commission
considers
whether
or
not
programming
is
offered
as
a
specialized
basis.
this
as
a
plus
factor
is
perhaps
less
influential
than
the
plus
factor
in
bakke
that
was
referred
to
in
the
harvard
plan.
here,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
fully
qualified
applicants.
how
do
you
choose
between
two
fully
qualified
applicants?
in
the
past
the
commission
has
made
certain
standards.
they
have
said
when
you
have
two
fully
qualified
applicants
we
will
look
at
such
things
as
local
residence,
we
will
look
at
such
things
as
what
civic
activities
you've
been
involved
in.
they
have
now
said
we
will
look
at
race
also
because
this
is
an
area
that
is
across
the
board
underrepresented
in
the
broadcast
industry.
there
is
no
danger
that
this
is
going
to
go
on
forever.
the
figures
are
so
low
that
there
is
really
no
reason
to
consider
how
it
ends,
but
at
this
point
what
we
are
talking
about
is
congress
is
authorizing
this
program
on
a
year-to-year
basis,
so
we
are
not
talking
about
any
possibility
of
going
on
into
the
future.
in
deciding
whether
or
not
to
have
this
program--
ms.
margaret
polivy
--diversity
of
views
is
certainly
a
rationale
that
is
permanent.
whether
there
is
a
minority
preference
or
not
is
a
matter
that
is
different.
the
whole
communications
act,
the
whole
commission's
allocation
of
new
licenses,
is
premised
on
diversity.
there
is
no
question
about
it.
that
would
go
on
as
long
as
the
commission
has
licenses
to
grant.
congress
has
approved
that.
congress
has
insisted
that
the
commission
continue
to
look
at
the
diversity
of
ownership.
what
they
have
said
here
is
that
on
the
basis
of
their
experience,
on
the
basis
of
30
years'
worth
of
congressional
hearings,
commission
hearings...
and
i
commend
the
senate
brief
to
your
attention
for
the
background
of
that...
that
we
believe
that
this
is
an
area
that
the
commission
must
consider
and
continue
to
consider
until
we
are
satisfied
at
such
time
that
the
past
deprivation
has
been...
the
balance
has
been
changed.
in
fullilove
this
court
made
clear
that
congress
need
not
have
a
record
in
the
same
sense
that
a
court
or
an
administrative
agency
indeed
must
compile
a
record.
in
the
area
of
minority
preferences,
congress
has
been
holding
hearings.
congress
has
had
experience
in
this
area
for
almost
30
years.
contrary
to
petitioner's
suggestion,
it
would
be
difficult,
indeed,
to
conclude
that
congress
didn't
know
what
was
going
on.
congress
has
been
intimately
involved
in
this
process.
the
basis
for
congressional
action
here
has
extended
both
in
terms
of
the
legislative
approach
and
in
terms
of
hearing
approach.
under
the
standard
of
fullilove
one
must,
i
think
in
this
case
accord--
ms.
margaret
polivy
--thank
you.
