mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
broadcasting
industry
has
the
power
to
shape
public
opinion
in
this
country
that
few,
if
any,
others
can
match.
this
case
involves
a
forward-looking
decision
by
congress
that
we
will
all
benefit
if
this
powerful
medium
communicates
to
us
the
views
and
perspectives
of
minorities,
and
to
that
end
some
race-conscious
steps
are
needed
to
increase
the
number
of
minority-owned
broadcast
stations.
before
i
begin
my
argument,
one
brief
reference
to
the
gender
question
since
it
did
come
up.
without
the
minority
enhancement,
rainbow's
qualitative
showing
is
not
as
strong
as
metro's,
even
if
rainbow
keeps
the
gender
enhancement.
so
the
commission,
as
it
indicated
in
the
specific
language
that
was
referred
to
by
petitioner's
counsel,
has
indicated
that
the
gender
enhancement
doesn't
decide
this
case.
that
would
have
to
be
remanded--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--justice
scalia,
there
would
have
to
be
a
remand.
you
could
not
affirm
the
judgment
below.
there
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion
in
the
earlier
colloquy
with
petitioner's
counsel
about
the
factual
predicate
and
congress'
powers
under
commerce
or
the
fourteenth
amendment.
before
we
get
to
that,
i
would
like
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
a
lot
of
the
cases
where
that
has
been
discussed...
and
i'm
thinking,
for
example,
of
fullilove...
have
presented
the
court
with
a
situation
in
which
congress
was
giving
what
has
been
referred
to
in
the
affirmative
action
litigation
as
a
purely
remedial
program.
it's
critical
to
understand
that
in
this
case...
and
so
the
court...
in
this
case
the
court
need
not
decide
whether
the
factual
record
here
would
support
a
purely
remedial
program
in
an
economic
sense
because
in
this
case,
of
course,
the
immediate
beneficiary
of
these
policies
are
minorities
if
they
are
granted
licenses
and
have
the
opportunity
to
operate
the
station.
but
it
is
critical
to
understand
that
congress'
purpose
here
is
not...
that's
not
the
purpose.
the
purpose,
the
ultimate
purpose
here,
is
to
benefit
the
public's
interest
in
a
diversity
of
expression
over
the
airways.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
has
previously
had
occasion
to
recognize--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--yes,
sir.
and
that
is
the
position
congress
has
taken,
and
that's
the
position
the
commission
supports.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
yes,
sir.
by
way
of
background,
the
court
has
had
occasion
in
the
past
in
the
cross-ownership
case
ten
years
ago
and
earlier
in
the
storer
case
to
be
familiar
with
the
commission's
position
that
there
is
a
nexus
between
the
source,
the
owner,
and
the
diversity
of
programming.
now,
this
case
requires
a
further
step
that
has
not
been
taken
by
the
court
before,
and
this
step
requires
that
the
court
consider
whether
there
is
a
nexus
between
race
and
expression,
and
the
commission's
position
is
that
that
is
a
defensible,
predictive
judgment.
first,
it
is
a
judgment
that
has
been
made
by
university
admissions
officials
who
are
in
the
business
of
achieving
diversity.
it
is
a
judgment
that
justice
powell
in
the
bakke
opinion
seemed
to
accept,
and
justice
powell
has
always
been
an
advocate
of
strict
scrutiny
in
these
cases
and
yet
he
accepted
that
nexus
in
the
bakke
case
without
demanding
empirical
proof.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
congress'
opponents
in
this
litigation
have
understood
the
position
to
be
that
all
members
of
a
group
think
in
one
way.
we
reject
that
characterization,
justice
scalia.
the
very
harvard
plan
upon
which
we
rely
so
heavily
in
this
place.
as
it
was
described
in
justice
powell's
opinion,
it
explains
that
the
reason
why
harvard
doesn't
want
to
limit
itself
to
10
or
20
black
students
is
that
they
couldn't
begin
to
bring
to
their
classmates
the
variety
of
points
of
view,
backgrounds
and
experiences
of
blacks
in
the
united
states.
so,
it's
not--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--but
i
referred
to
it--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--i
refer
to
it,
justice
scalia,
only
for
the
purpose
of
telling
you
that
the
policy
does
not
rest
on
a
judgment
that
all
members
of
a
group
think
in
the
same
way.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
justice
kennedy,
the--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--the
commission
and
congress
in
their
consideration
of
alternatives
are
limited
both
by
renewal
expectancy
considerations
and
by
first
amendment
considerations,
and
this
court
in
the
case
about
10
years
ago...
it
was
involving
cable,
but
the
court
spoke
to
broadcasting
as
well
and
said
that
there
are
concerns
in
section
3(h)
of
the
communications
act.
these
concerns
reflect
first
amendment
concerns,
and
these
concerns
do
not
permit
the
commission
to
dictate
to
a
broadcast
licensee
that
it
shall
turn
over
its
facilities
for
the
expression
of
a
particular
program.
now,
obviously--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--well,
we
do
attempt
through
structural
regulations
to
achieve
the
public
interest
in
programming
content
without
direct
content
regulation.
the
question
of
when--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--well,
there's
no
question
that
this
judgment
believes
that
if
there
are
more
minority
owners...
it's
a
nominally
structural
regulation...
but
if
there
are
more
minority
owners,
when
all
is
said
and
done
at
some
point
in
the
future,
the
public
will
have
received
a
diversity
of
expression
that
it
will
not
have
received
if
we
do
not
have
the
minorities.
so,
in
that
sense
we
are
influencing
the--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--well,
justice
o'connor,
certainly.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
your
question
has
two
thoughts.
the
court
certainly...
nonminority
licensees
have
obligations
to
offer
issue-responsive
programming
for
their
entire
audience,
and
that
would
include
presentation
fairly
of
minority
perspectives.
but
the
court
itself
in
a
dictum,
in
a
footnote
in
the
naacp
case
in
1976,
said,
after
rejecting
the
authority
of
the
federal
power
commission
to
have...
to
pursue
employment
discrimination,
referred
to
the
fcc's
attempts
to
get
more
minority
employees.
and
the
court
said
that
can
be
justified
because
it
is
related
to
the
commission's
duty
to
ensure
that
a
licensee's
programming
fairly
reflects
the
views
and
perspectives
of
minority
groups.
if--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--justice
o'connor,
two
thoughts.
one--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--no,
we
have
not,
because
it
would
be
improper
for
us
to
do
so.
what
we
are
talking
about
in
an
effort
to
justify
this
policy
is
not
achieving
some
quantity
of
entertainment
programming
that
will
appeal
to
this
or
that
audience.
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
presentation
of
the
more
subtle
point
of
views
and
perspectives
in
news,
in
editorial
comment,
in
public
affairs
and
it,
admittedly,
would
be
very
difficult
empirically
to
demonstrate
the
validity
of
the
predictive
judgment,
just
as
it
would
very
difficult
empirically
for
a
university
to
demonstrate
the
validity
of
a--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--and
the
first
amendment
would
present
very
difficult--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--the
focus--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--the
focus
is
on
ownership,
justice
o'connor.
that's
the
focus.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
well,
the
one
thing
we
can
evaluate...
i
don't
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
we
should
be
standing
before
you
today
and
looking
at
the
content
and
saying
look
at
the
content
here
and
look
at
what
it
was
in
1970
and
see,
there's
more
diversity.
i
would
be...
approach
this
podium
with
great
trepidation
if
that
were
my
assignment,
given
the
first
amendment
and
given
the
fact
that
i
represent
a
government
licensing
agency.
but
what
we
can
assess,
we
can
assess
the
ownership.
we
can
see
how
many
broadcast
stations
in
this
nationwide
industry
are
owned
by
minorities.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
i
believe
that
we
are
saying,
justice
kennedy,
that
it
is
necessary
in
this
area.
that
whatever
we
do
to
accomplish
goals...
i
don't
want
to
foreswear
any
content
regulation.
this
court
has
had
cases
from
the
commission
in
the
past
in
which
we've
been
doing
that.
our
opponents
in
the
industry
from
time
to
time
have
been
here,
but
it
is
a
tightrope
and
it
is
a
concern
that
we
have
limits
on
how
far
we
can
go,
and
so
we
do
try
and
congress
tries
to
fill
that
void
by
structural-type
regulations
that
are
intended
to
achieve
the
same
purpose.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
the
congress
came
up
with
the
groups.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
and
the
commission
has
accepted
what
congress
did
in
the
lottery
sense.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
and
the
groups
are
not
unique
to
this
particular
case.
these
are
essentially
the
same
groups
that
the
congress
had
in
the
program
that
was
before
the
court
in
fullilove,
and
they...
congress
has
explained
in
the
conference
report
on
the
lottery
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
congress
has
identified
the
groups
that
it
believed
have
been
the
victims
of
discrimination,
society-wide
discrimination.
congress
obviously--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--well,
this
is
where
the
case...
we
said
it
didn't
involve
a
purely
remedial
case,
but
it
involves
in
part
the
remedial
aspect
because
congress--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--in
identifying
the
groups
that
the
congress
believed
the
public
most
needed
to
hear
from
the
congress
said,
given
our
wealth
of
experiencing
in
broadcasting,
given
our
wealth
of
involvement
with
civil
rights
litigation,
we
believe
the
groups,
the
public
most
needs
to
hear
from
are
those
groups
that
have
been
the
victims
of
discrimination.
and
the
congress
said
we
have
extensive
experience
in
identifying
whose
those
groups
are
from
our
civil
rights
activity
for
the
past
30
years,
and
they
listed
the
six
groups.
that's
how
they
came
up
with
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
the...
obviously
we
had
to
refer,
justice
white,
to
the
past
because
that
is
how
congress
decided
who
should
be
in
the
picture.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
but,
no,
sir,
we
are
relying
in
this
case--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--the
forward-looking
purpose
to
achieve
a
diversity
of
expression
for
the
benefit
of
the
public.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
the
court
would
not
have
to
in
this
case
hold
that--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--well,
i...
i
think
it's
clear
from
the...
the
court
has
to
decide
whether
what
congress
did
is
lawful,
but
it's
clear
what
congress
has
in
mind.
and
congress
did
in
the
lottery
report...
conference
report
for
the
lottery
statute...
say
in
addition
to
the
diversity
objective,
they
thought
this
case
was
like
the--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--but
this
is
congress
now,
justice
white,
that's
acted.
this
is
congress
the
court
has
to
review.
so
i
think
that
given
the
fact
that
congress
has
acted,
the
court
would
not
have
to
hold
in
this
case
that
diversity
alone
could
support
a
race-conscious
effort.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
when
they
said
that,
justice
white,
they
did
refer
to
the
1982
lottery
statute.
and
in
that
lottery
statute,
which
was
intended
to
address
the
situation
that
would
govern
if
we
didn't
have
a
prepared
hearing,
they
expressed
the
remedial
purpose.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
the
amicus
brief
of
the
senate...
no,
sir,
they
didn't
change
the
basis
on
which
we
had
acted,
but
we
have
been
acting
since
'82--
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
--yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
armstrong
but
i
believe
as
in
fullilove
the
earlier
statute
is
relevant,
and
the
earlier
statute
indicates
that
congress
also
had
the
remedial
purpose
in
mind.
