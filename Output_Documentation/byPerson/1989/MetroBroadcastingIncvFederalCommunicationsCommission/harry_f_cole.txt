mr.
harry
f.
cole
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
december
of
1983
my
client,
alan
shurberg,
who
is
the
respondent
here,
applied
for
a
tv
station
in
hartford,
connecticut.
he's
a
lifelong
resident
of
hartford,
and
in
1984
the
fcc
refused
even
to
consider
his
application
because
mr.
shurberg
is
white.
at
the
same
time,
though,
the
fcc
granted
petitioner
astroline's
mutually
exclusive
application
because
one
richard
ramirez,
a
boston
resident
who
had
been
recruited
to
serve
as
astroline's
supposedly
controlling
general
partner
was
said
to
be
hispanic-american.
that
was
the
sole
difference
between
the
two
applications
and
the
sole
distinguishing
factor.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
the
record
only
reflects
that
he
was
said
to
be
hispanic-american,
your
honor.
there
is
no...
the
fcc
did
not
require
any
further
discussion
of
that
and--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--no,
justice
o'connor.
in
fact,
that's
all
that
was
reviewed
in
this
case.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
in
an
uncontested
situation
i
believe
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that
a
caucasian--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--no.
what
would
then
happen
or
what
is
my
experience
in
that
situation
is
that
the
hispanic
woman
makes
clear
on
the
face
of
her
application
that
she
is,
in
fact,
hispanic
herself
and
that
her
name
merely
reflects
her
marital
status.
and
in
those
situations
the
fcc,
at
least
in
my
experience,
would
tend
to
accord
that
person
minority
status.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
well,
i
would
agree
with
your
honor.
and
in
fact,
the
fcc
initially
used
surname
in
the
1978
articulation
of
the
policy
and
ultimately
abandoned
that
i
believe
in
1982
just
to
use
the
term
hispanic.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
it
would
appear
to
be
the
case
although
again,
in
this
situation
all
that
was
stated
in
the
application
was
mr.
ramirez
is
an
hispanic-american.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
i
could
not
tell
you
that,
justice
scalia.
i
knew...
we
stated
in
our
brief--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--not
to
my
knowledge.
in
fact,
we
said
in
our
brief
the
storer
broadcasting
case
where
the
fcc
reviewed
a
family's
lineage
back
to
1492
to
determine
that
a...
a
family
named
lieberman
was,
in
fact,
hispanic.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
conceivably...
actually,
no,
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
the
case,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
we
filed
a
petition
to
deny,
obviously,
raising
a
number
of
questions
including
the
constitutionality
of
the
distress
sale.
and
we
had
no
other
information...
we
had
no
information
on
which
to
challenge
his...
his
racial
or
ethnic
status.
we
were
certainly
not
willing
to
concede
his
racial
or
ethnic
status
without
examination.
we
had
no
discovery
rights,
we
had
no
cross-examination
rights.
we
had
only
what
we
could
dig
up
out
and
about.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
had
we
been
able
to
dig
something,
we
might...
presumably
we
could
have
disclosed
that
to
the
fcc,
and
we
might
have
made
some
headway.
we
might
not
have.
i
would
be
speculative
if
i
guessed.
the
basis
for
the
disparate
treatment
between
shurberg
on
the
one
hand
and
astroline
on
the
other
was
the
fcc's
minority
distress
sale
policy.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
the
way
as
i
understand
the
partnership
setup...
and
again,
this
is
not
my
client
so
it's...
all
i
can
tell
you
is
what
i
understand
through
the
pleadings.
as
i
understand,
the
way
the
partnership
was
initially
conceived,
it
was
a
limited
partnership,
and
the...
mr.
ramirez
was
said
to
own
21
percent
overall
equity,
but
70
percent
voting
equity,
whereas
the
rest
of
the
people
were--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--that's
correct.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that's
correct.
and
also
i
should
point
out,
justice
kennedy,
that
this
is
a
1987
or
1986-87
document.
the
more
recent
document
on
file
with
the
fcc
shows
the
total
capital
contributions
by
the
so-called
limited
partner
is
in
the
range
of
$24
million,
and
mr.
ramirez's
remains
at
$210.
now,
that's...
that's
among
the
documents
which
we
lodge
with
the
court
as
supplemental
materials
with
our
brief.
in
acting
as
it
did
in
1984,
the
fcc
stated
that
on
balance
the
minority
distress
sale
policy
and
the
agency's
general
interest
in
increasing
minority
ownership
in
broadcast
stations
outweighed
the
statutorily
mandated
interest
inherent
in
considering
competing
applications
such
as
mr.
shurberg's.
in
so
doing
the
fcc
affirmed
what
the
minority
distress
sale
basically
says
on
its
face,
and
that
is
that
white
people
need
not
apply
when
the
minority
distress
sale
policy
is
involved.
the
fcc's
action
and
the
policy
underlying
it
are
the
guts
of
our
case
at
this
point,
and
our
argument
is
a
simple
one.
the
constitution
prohibits
racial
discrimination
by
the
government.
the
distress
sale
policy
is
a
governmental
policy
which
discriminated
against
mr.
shurberg
on
the
basis
of
his
race,
pretty
much
under
discussion.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
have
to
say
i've
sat
through
four
separate
arguments,
four
separate
presentations
this
morning
to
the
court,
and
i
think
the
one
lesson
that
i've
learned
is
that
there
is
no
basis
for
saying
exactly
what
the
fcc
was
doing.
the
fcc
itself,
as
i
believe
you've
noted
in
the
last
presentation,
had
specifically
disclaimed
here
this
morning
that
its
minority
ownership
policies
are
remedial
in
nature,
and
we
would
tend
to
agree
with
that,
although
some
of
the
briefs
in
this
case
have
indicated
that
they
believe
there
is
some
remedial
component.
in
any
event,
even
if
it
were
remedial
and
even
if
it
could
be
said
that
there
is
some
effort
to
correct
remediation,
it
is
not
at
all
narrowly
tailored
to
that
purpose.
in
other
words,
there's
no
showing...
again,
going
back
to
what
was
shown
in
the
application...
all
that
was
said
is
mr.
ramirez
is
an
hispanic-american.
it
doesn't
say
mr.
ramirez
is
an
hispanic-american
who
has
suffered
discrimination,
who
has
been
the
victim
of
any
kind
of
disadvantage
at
all.
and
the
fcc
policy
specifically
doesn't
get
into
that.
in
other
words,
it
is
not...
even
if
it
were
remedial
in
nature...
and
we
do
not
agree
that
it
is...
it
is
not
at
all
narrowly
tailored
to
correct
remediation
or,
i'm
sorry,
to
correct
conceivable
discrimination
which
has
occurred.
before
i
get
into
the
substance
of
my
argument
i
think
it
may
be
appropriate
to...
to
discuss
very
briefly
the
standard
of
review
because
there
has
been
a
lot
of
discussion
this
morning,
but
not
much
directed
to
precisely
what
issues
are
before
the
court.
as
i
understand
the
standard
of
review
with
respect
to
race-based
governmental
classifications,
it
is
incumbent
upon
the
proponent
of
that
classification,
whether
it's
an
agency,
local
government
or
even
the
federal
government
to
come
forward
and
explain
what
in
compelling
governmental
interest
the
classification
is
directed
to,
and
then
to...
to
demonstrate
that,
in
fact,
the
classification
is
narrowly
tailored
with
a
good
degree
of
precision
to
achieve
that
compelling
governmental
interest.
that...
that,
at
least,
is
my
understanding
of
the
strict
scrutiny
standard.
now,
in
this
case,
as
i
just
mentioned
to
justice
o'connor,
there
appears
to
be
some
confusion
as
to
exactly
what
compelling
governmental
interest
is
supposedly
being
advanced.
and
i
think
we
can
take
as
a
given
at
least
based
on
the
commission's
presentation
this
morning
that
it
is
not
remedial...
a
remedial
purpose
to...
to
correct
past
discrimination
although
i'm
certainly
happy
to
discuss
that
if
anyone
has
questions.
rather,
what
appears
to
be
the
commission's
position
now
is
that
it
is...
the
distress
sale
policy
in
particularly
in
the
minority
ownership
policies
as
a
whole
are
directed
to
the
advancement
of
program
diversity,
and
that
is
the
compelling
governmental
interest.
and
the
citation
is
to
the
first
amendment
and
the
diversity
of
voices
and
a
multiplicity
of
voices
and
so
forth.
i
want
to
say
right
off
the
top
that
shurberg
is
not
averse.
we
do
not
dispute
the
value
or
the
desirability,
especially
in
a
democratic
society
of
diversity
of
voices.
a
multiplicity
of
voices
is
clearly
the
way
that
our
society
has
chosen
to
govern
itself,
and
we
support
that.
our
problem
is
that
race-based
classifications
are
completely
and
utterly
inappropriate
and
unnecessary
for
the
advancement
of
that
interest.
there
is
absolutely
no
rational
connection
at
all
between
the
asserted
goal
and
the
policy.
so
from
that
point
of
view
we
would
challenge
the
notion
of...
of...
of
program
diversity
as...
as
a
valid
compelling
governmental
interest.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
certainly.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
we're
talking
commercial
stations,
sir?
mr.
harry
f.
cole
well,
if
i
may
at
least
initially
restrict
my...
my...
my
response
to
commercial
stations,
in
the
commercial
broadcast
area,
broadcast
programming
is
market
driven.
even
mr.
wollenberg
in
his
amicus
brief
for
capital
cities
in
the
metro
case
concedes
that
point.
they're
market-driven
considerations.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
i
would
have
to
get
his
brief
out,
but...
i...
there
is--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--i
believe
so
or
certainly--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--i
will
accept
that,
yes,
sir.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no.
in
fact,
it
may
be
that
the...
there
would
be
vast
differences
in
programming,
but
the
vast
differences
might
arise
not
because...
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
race
of
the
owners.
for
instance,
the
fcc's
review
board
has
specifically
found
that
in
at
least
two
instances
that
were...
that
were
subjects
of
litigation,
nonminority
white
owners
had
provided
what
was
referred
to
as
extraordinary
program
service
to
a
hispanic
and
to
a
black
audience.
in
fact,
even
here
in
the
washington,
d.c.
market,
there
are...
i'm
aware
of
two
stations
one
of
which
is
owned
by
whites
but
programs
primarily
for
a
black
audience
and--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--yes.
it
should
be
presumed
to
be
so
for...
for
regulatory
purposes.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
i
suppose
that
would
depend
on
the
republicans
and
the
democrats.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that
may
be,
but
again,
there
is
no
constitutional
problem
with...
the
constitution
is
not--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--that
would
raise...
that
would
raise
first
amendment
problems,
but
not
equal
protection
problems.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
well,
the...
i'm
sorry?
mr.
harry
f.
cole
in
the
republican-democrat
situation
i
would
suggest
that
a
different
standard
of
review
might
conceivably
apply
because
again
there
are
no
equal
protection
problems
or
considerations
raised
on
the
face
of
that
hypothetical.
now--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--but
the
constitution
does
not
mandate
that.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
i
believe
there
is
a
requirement
of
at
least
some...
some
split.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes,
there
is.
[laughter]
one
problem
or
a
threshold
problem
with
the
notion
of
program
diversity,
even
assuming
that
there
were
some...
some
basis
for
it,
is
a
valid,
compelling
governmental
interest
for
strict
scrutiny
purposes
is
that
this
court
has
never
approved
race-based
classifications
just
because
they
might
achieve
some
good
or
desirable
goal.
such
an
approach
would
enable
congress
to
enact
a
wide
variety
of
racial
classifications.
as
justice
scalia
suggested
in
questioning
petitioner's
counsel,
it
is
conceivable
under
the
same
rationale,
program
diversity
rationale
if
it's
accepted
here,
that
ten
years
from
now
the
commission
could
state
that...
issue
a
policy
statement
saying
that
there
are
too
few
white
upper-middle
class
classical
music
stations
in
the
major
urban
areas
and
that,
therefore,
we're
going
to
set
aside
a
certain
number
of
those
for...
in
order
to
promote
diversity
in
that
respect
because
we
see
a
lack
there.
and
again,
if
the
policies
are
affirmed
today,
then
presumably
that
policy
would
be
affirmed
as
well.
by
the
same
token,
it
is
conceivable
that
this
could
extend
outward
to
other
important
institutions
beyond
the
broadcasting
range.
for
example,
federal
judgeships.
if
it
is
desirable
to
have
a
multiplicity
of...
of
people
or
representative
voices
in
some...
in
some
respect
along
those
lines,
then
very
conceivably
it...
that...
that
rationale
could
be
extended
to
include--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--there
are
minority
ownership
policies,
i
believe--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--you
mean
carriage
provisions
for
so
that
a
local
cable
system
will
have
to
carry?
no.
those
have
been...
those
are
the
former
"must-carry"
provisions,
and
those
have
eliminated,
justice
white.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
there
used
to
be,
yes.
yes.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
i
have
not
researched
or
briefed
that
point.
my...
my
gut
reaction
is
that
that
is
not,
again,
a
race-sensitive
issue
that
raises
on
its
face
equal
protection
problems.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
well,
i
had
thrown
in...
used
the
term
white,
upper-middle
class
music
stations.
in
that--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--that
would
certainly
be
far
less
objectionable.
it
might
arise
in--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--it
might
be.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
yes.
that's
correct.
it
might
raise
some
content
regulation
problems.
but
certainly
from
an
equal
protection
point
of
view,
i
would
have
no
problem
with
it.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no.
this
policy
inquires
only
as
to
racial
or
ethnic
status,
and
that's
the
end
of
the
discussion.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
second
objectionable
aspect
of...
of...
of
program
diversity
as
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
it
is
based
on
a
racist
assumption.
it
assumes
that
each
racial
or
ethnic
group
has
its
own
minority
viewpoint
and
that
that
minority
viewpoint
will
ultimately
be
reflected
in
mr.
shurberg.
that
is
nothing
less
than
a
racist
attitude
which
ignores
individual
traits
and
abilities
and
instead
substitutes
invidious
stereotypes
rather
than
consideration
of
the
individual.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
i'm
saying
two
things,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
first,
i'm
saying
that
that's
correct,
that
those
kind
of
programs
can
be
provided
and
may
very
likely
be
provided
by
any
number
of
different
people
from
different
groups,
but
i'm
also
saying
that
it's
inappropriate
to
assume,
certainly
as
a
legislative
constitutional
matter,
that
all
black
people
like
soul
music,
that
that
is...
that's
not
a
rational
conclusion.
black
people
like
all
kinds
of
music,
as
do
white
people,
as
do
hispanic
people.
there--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--yes,
i
would
say
that
is--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--that
is
a
presumption
which
would
offend
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
sure.
the
need
for
programming
as
perceived
by
the
actual
audience
itself
is...
is...
is
certainly
a
consideration
which
might
be
taken
into
account.
but
again,
the
need
for
programming,
for
any
particular
programming,
may
not
be
racially
driven.
even
though
you
interview
75
percent
of
the
people
in
washington,
d.c.
and
in
that
survey
obtain
a...
a
skewed
heavily
toward
blacks,
even
if
they
all
happen
to
say,
yes,
we
like
x
kind
of
music,
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
all
blacks...
that
that
is
racially
driven.
that
may
be
class
driven,
geographically
driven,
economically
driven.
there
are
any
number
of
other
factors
which
enter
into
it
other
than
race,
and
that's
all
we're
saying,
that
race
is
irrelevant,
and
race
should
be
irrelevant.
the
range
of
viewpoints
that...
that
are
available
in
any
particular
race
or
ethnic
group
is,
in
our
view,
at
least,
similar
if
not
identical
to
the
equivalent
range
in
other
groups.
for
example,
you
have
david
duke.
you
have
louis
farrakhan.
you
have
abbey
hoffman.
you've
got
eldridge
cleaver.
you
have
admiral
william
crowley.
you
have
general
colin
powell.
you've
got
george
wallace.
you
have
gus
savage.
there
are
ranges,
and
certainly
just
because--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--justice
scalia--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--i'm
not
arguing
that
the
government
can
take
these
into
account
at
all.
i
believe
you
understood
my
point
precisely,
that...
that
i'm
not
arguing
that
these
factors
can
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
i
suppose
it
could,
but
what
it
can't
do
is
compel
that
the
license
which
is
issued
by
the
fcc
go
to
a
hispanic
or
mexican
or
what...
or
any
particular
ethnic
group
because
of
the
assumption
that
that
ethnic
group
will
provide
mariachi
music.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
from
an
equal
protection
point
of
view
i
have
no
objection
to
that.
from
a
content
regulation
point
of
view,
that
may
raise
other
questions,
depending
on
the
structure
of
the
policy.
and
the
commission
has,
as
the
court
is
aware
in
the
wncn
case,
has
moved
itself
completely
away
from
government
regulation
of
entertainment
formats.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that's
correct.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that's
correct.
the
bottom
line
as
far
as
the
compelling
interest
is
concerned,
in
our
view,
is
it
can
be
reduced
to
two
questions.
why
is
alan
shurberg
any
less
capable
of
increasing
program
diversity
just
because
he
is
white,
and
why
is
astroline
any
more
capable
of
doing
so
just
because
it
is...
its
supposedly
controlling
principal
has
a
spanish-sounding
last
name?
and
i
think
that...
that
presents
that
point
as
clearly
as
i
can.
i
would
like
to
proceed
to
the
second
aspect
of
the
strict
scrutiny
standard,
which
is
the
narrow
tailoring,
that
even
if
it
is
accepted
for
the
sake
of
argument,
that
the
program
diversity
is
a
valid,
compelling
governmental
interest
sufficient
to
support
race-based
classifications,
it
still
has
to
be...
the
program
still
has
to
be
narrowly
tailored
to
meet
that.
the
distress
sale
policy
is
not
narrowly
tailored
in
any
sense,
meaningful
or
otherwise.
the
only
requirement
that
needs
to
be...
that
is
imposed
on
a
minority
distress
sale
applicant
is
that
it
is
assert
that
it
is
minority
controlled.
there
is
nothing
about
any
program
commitments.
the
applicant
does
not
have
to
show
in
his
application
what
he
expects
to
do
or
what
he
may
do
or
what
he'd
like
to
do,
and,
in
fact,
as
we've
indicated
in
the...
in
our
brief,
the...
what
astroline
ultimately
came
up
with
in
the
way
of
programing
in
our
view
shows
not
a
tremendous
sensitivity
to
minorities.
secondly,
there
is
no
limit
on
the
number
of
other
stations
that
might
be
owned
by
the
distress
sale
applicant.
in
other
words,
if
i'm
a
distress
sale
applicant
and
i
own
35
other
stations,
am,
fm
and
tv
stations,
i'm
still
qualified
for
an
absolutely
dispositive
preference
under
the
distress
sale
policy
as
against
somebody
who's
white
but
doesn't
own
any
stations.
this
makes
no
sense
as
far
as
program
diversity
is
concerned.
second,
there's...
or
third,
there's
no
need
for
a
showing
of
the
need
for
the
programming.
in
other
words,
for
example,
assume
a
community
with
three
radio
stations,
all
of
which
are
playing
rock
and
roll
music
of
a
similar
genre,
and
a
distress
sale
applicant
comes
in
and
says
i
want
to
come
in.
he's
not
required
to
show
that
he's
going
to
anything
other
than
rock
and
roll
music
of
that
genre.
there's
no...
there's
nothing
at
the...
at
the
door
when
he
walks
into
the
commission
to
indicate
to
the
commission
that
program
diversity
will
be
increased
in
the
least.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
no,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
i'm
sorry.
i
correct
myself.
there
is
a
one-year
holding
period.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
that's
correct,
for
whatever
dollar
value
to
whomever.
let
the
marketplace
govern.
and
as
we've
indicated
in
the
brief
that
people
who
have
taken
advantage
of
the
distress
sale
have
made
out
quite
well.
one
entity
bought
a
station
for
$3.5
million
and
sold
it
five,
six
years
later
for
$35
million,
so
it's
in
the
nature
of,
not
so
much
programming--
mr.
harry
f.
cole
--i
would
hope
so,
your
honor,
for
that
amount
of
money.
there's
no
indication
required
that
the
distressed
sale
applicant
demonstrate
an
ability
or
familiarity
with
the
local...
an
ability
to
serve
the
local
community
or
familiarity
with
the
local
community.
this
is
a...
a
similar
component
is
imposed
in
the
comparative
preferences
area
so
that
a
white
person
who
is
a
local
resident
of
the
area
is
deemed
by
the
fcc
to
have
the
equivalent
enhancement
value
as
a
minority
who
is
not
from
the
area.
there
is
no...
that
doesn't
enter
into
the
matrix
in
the
distress
sale
policy.
if
i
might,
there
are
alternative
measures.
if
the
fcc
really
wants
to
get
to
minority...
or,
diverse
programming,
there
is
one
very
simple
expedient
which
it
could
use.
it
could
say
only...
it
could
reduce
to
one
the
maximum
number
of
stations
that
any
individual
or
entity
could
own.
just
reduce
it
to
one
and
say,
that
is
all
there
is.
one
per
person,
come
and
get
them.
if
the
theory
of
program
diversity
is
that
the
maximum
number
of
owners
leads
to
the
maximum
amount
of
diversity,
that
would
be
the
way
to
do
it.
it
could
be
done
on
a
race-neutral
basis,
and
it
could
be
done
tomorrow.
the
fcc
has
not
done
that.
to
the
contrary,
over
the
last
five
years
it
has
increased
the
number
of
stations
that
can
be
owned
by
any
particular
entity,
almost
doubling
them
from
seven
to
12,
and
in
some
situations
as
many
as
14
can
be
owned.
that
being
the
case,
it
would
appear
that
the
fcc
is
not
as
concerned
about
diversity
as
it
would
have
the
general
public
believe.
i
would
like
to
address
very
briefly
the
3.5
percent
figure,
because
i
think
it's
an
important
one
if
the
question
of
remediation
arises
at
any
point.
ms.
polivy
during
the
metro
argument
referenced
the
fact
that
only
3.5
percent
of
the
broadcast
stations
in
the
country
are
owned
by
minorities,
and
this
is
asserted
in
some
of
the
briefs
as
a
basis
for
concluding
there
is
an
underrepresentation.
i
don't
want
the
court
to
go
away
thinking
that
that
is
in
fact
a
valid
assessment
of
the
situation.
in
fact,
the
congressional
research
study
report
indicates,
i
believe...
and
it's
cited
by
the
fcc
in
its
own
brief...
that
minority
participation
in
the
broadcast
industry
may
be
somewhere
between
13
and
15
percent.
the
2
to
3.5
percent
figure
which
is
so
frequently
cited
by
the
various
supporters
of
the
policy
relates
only
to
those
situations
in
which
the
minority
person
or
people
exercise
what
the
fcc
defines
as
control
of
the
license,
control
being
defined
as
50
percent
or
more
ownership.
so
that
if
a
minority
individual
happened
to
own
49.9
percent
of
a
chain
of
stations
that
amounted
to
25,
35
stations,
that
ownership
would
not
be
reflected
at
all.
mr.
harry
f.
cole
thank
you.
