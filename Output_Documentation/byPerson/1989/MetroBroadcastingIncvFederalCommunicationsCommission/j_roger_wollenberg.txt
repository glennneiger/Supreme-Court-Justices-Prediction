mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start...
in
light
of
the
discussion
in
the
previous
case,
before
turning
to
the
specifics
of
the
astroline
case,
i
would
like
to
start
with
a
little
more
discussion
of
the
nature
of
the
communications
act.
the
communications
act
is
unique
in
our
governmental
system.
it
was
essentially
a
structure
invented
by
herbert
hoover
a
long
time
ago,
and
it
attempts
to
handle
a
dilemma
of
major
proportions,
which
is
the
dilemma
of
the
necessity
of
a
licensing
scheme
for
broadcast
frequencies
to
avoid
a
total
interference
and
total
chaos,
a
licensing
scheme
which,
since
it
goes
over
the
whole
country,
must
be
federally
applied,
and
the
fact
that
the
resulting
broadcast
activities
have
enormous
first
amendment
implications
because
the
broadcasting
industry
is
very,
very
significant
agency
for
informing
the
american
people.
and
this
has
resulted
in
compromises,
if
you
like,
in
treatment
over
the
years
that
is
different
from
other
areas.
it
is
different
from
industries
not
so
effective.
it
is
different
from
the
newspaper
industry,
which
doesn't
have
a
licensing
problem.
so
way
back
in
nbc
v.
united
states,
this
court
said
that
the
fcc
is
not
a
mere
traffic
cop.
it's
concerned
with
the
nature
of
the
traffic,
as
well
as
its
distribution.
this
court
in
red
lion...
excuse
me...
this
court
in
red
lion
upheld
a
very
significant
action
by
the
commission
in
requiring
what
was
called
the
fairness
doctrine,
which
meant
in
substance
that
if
one
side
of
a
controversial
issue
was
discussed,
that
it
would
be
necessary
to
provide
discussion
of
other
viewpoints.
in
other
words,
a
diversity
of
viewpoints
was
imposed
by
the
commission
and
upheld
by
this
court
in
red
lion.
of
course,
that
can
be
called
content
control.
it
is
not
saying
what
position
should
be
taken.
it
is
not
a
very
precise
or
detailed
form
of
content
control,
but
it's
a
form
of
content
control.
it
was
mentioned
earlier
today,
the
listeners
guild
case,
and
with
deference,
i
think
it
was
not
accurately
described.
the
suggestion
was
that
in
the
listeners
guild
case
that
this
court
said
that
it
is
wonderful...
not
wonderful,
it
is
appropriate
for
the
commission
to
leave
entirely
to
the
marketplace
what
goes
out
over
the
air.
a
closer
examination
of
the
listeners
guild
case
will
reveal
that
the
subject
of
it
was
entertainment
programming
and
that
the
court,
in
upholding
the
commission's
decision
to
leave
entertainment
to
the
marketplace,
was
not
dealing
with
the
nonentertainment
aspects
of
it.
now,
it's
perfectly
true
that
the
commission
over
the
years
and
to
some
degree
the
court
over
the
years
have
gone
up
and
down
on
the
question
of
the
degree
of
intrusiveness
which
is
appropriate
and
permissible
on
the
part
of
the
commission
in
order
to
carry
out
what
one
of
the
arguments
this
morning
referred
to
as
the
trustee
notion
of
broadcasting.
it
was
suggested
from
the
bench
that
what
we
are
all
in
for
is
to
make
the
maximum
money
and
therefore
the
only
test
that
will
be
applied
by
a
broadcaster,
regardless
of
origins,
is
to
make
the
most
money.
i
would
hope
that
there
are
other
factors
which
enter
into
it,
but
be
that
as
it
may,
i
suggest
that
with
the
licensing
necessity,
and
with
the
communications
act
and
its
structure
having
been
upheld
over
the
years,
that
the
determination
of
that
question
is
a
question
for
congress.
i
think
there
has
been
unfortunately,
today,
because
congress
isn't
here
except
through
an
extremely
impressive
and
comprehensive
brief
by
the
united
states
senate...
not
a
senator,
but
by
the
united
states
senate...
on
the
subject.
because
the
congress
isn't
here
and
the
representative
of
the
fcc
is
here,
there
is
a
tendency
of
the
court
to
treat
this
as
an
fcc
matter.
it
really,
as
the
brief
for
the
senate
shows
and
as
mr.
armstrong's
argument
made
clear,
it
is
not
an
fcc
matter.
the
fcc
received
large
numbers
of
signals
over
the
years
that
it
should
pay
more
attention
to
the
composition
of
ownership
of
broadcast
stations,
and
when
the
fcc
adopted
the
policies
that
have
been
discussed
this
morning
and
then
at
a
later
time
a
differently
composed
commission
looked
as
though
it
was
going
to
change
those
policies,
congress
stepped
in
and
very
explicitly
told
it
not
to.
now--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--justice
o'connor,
i
find
it
impossible
to
comprehend
or
accept
the
notion
that
congress'
powers
are
somehow
greater
under
section
5
when
dealing
with
federal
areas.
this
court--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--under
its
commerce
clause,
under
its
spending
powers--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--yes,
and
when
we
say
equal
protection
component,
we
have
to
say
component,
because
this
court,
quite
properly,
read
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
into
the
fifth
amendment,
just
as
it
has
read
the
amendments
to
the
bill
of
rights
into
the
civil
war
amendments,
and
just
yesterday
there
was
a
jury
trial...
i'm
sorry,
an
election
spending
requirement
of
a
state
that
was
subjected
to
analysis
under
the
first
amendment.
so
i
think
it
is
one
constitution,
now,
and
i
think
any
notion
that
somehow
or
other
the
congress
has
greater
power
in
its
own
areas
because
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
or
needs
to
rely
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
i
think
is
not
well
taken.
i
think
that
the
congress
is
functioning
here...
there
has
been
a
good
deal
of
discussion
this
morning
on
the
question
of
remedial,
and
i
think
some
of
the
terminology
gets
confusing,
or
imprecise,
as
to
what
kind
of
remedial
we
mean.
no
one
is
contending--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--no,
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
the
fcc
stands
here
defending
the
requirement
that
congress
has
imposed.
and
contrary
to
the
suggestion
that
congress
just
late
some
night
did
something
in
an
appropriations
act
saying
don't
change
your
policies,
contrary
to
that
suggestion,
in
congressional
reports
and
testimony
and
so
forth
before
congress,
the
focus
has
been
very
definitely
on
diversity
and
on
remedial
in
the
sense
that,
not
that
the
fcc
has
discriminated,
not
that
broadcasters
have
discriminated,
but
that
as
a
result
of
society-wide
discrimination,
which
we
all
know
about
and
which
this
court
has
mentioned
in
a
variety
of
contexts,
that
at
the
beginning
at
least
there
was
an
extraordinarily
small
percentage
of
broadcast
ownership
by
minorities.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i
do.
the
senate
report
on
the
'82
act
said,
"a
third
important
factor
in
diversifying
the
media
of
mass
communications
is
promoting
ownership
by
racial
and
ethnic
minorities,
groups
which...
that
traditionally
have
been
extremely
underrepresented
in
the
ownership
of
telecommunication
facilities
and
media
properties.
"
"the
policy
of
encouraging
diversity
of
information
sources
is
best
served
by
not
only
awarding
preferences
based
on
the
number
of
properties
already
owned,
but
also
by
assuring
that
minority
and
ethnic
groups
that
have
been
unable
to
acquire
any
significant
degree
of
media
ownership
are
provided
an
increased
opportunity
to
do
so.
"
"it
is
hoped
that
this
approach
to
enhancing
the
diversity
through
such
structural
means
will,
in
turn,
broaden
the
nature
and
type
of
information
and
programming
disseminated
to
the
public.
"
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i
think
that's
absolutely
correct.
i
think
that
that
is
true
in
jury
cases,
too,
if,
your
honor
please.
in
other
words,
when
the
sixth
amendment
impartial
trial
is
concerned,
while
the
court
may
differ
as
to
whether
it
applies
to
the
panel
or
the
venire,
the
approach
is
that
to
have
an
impartial
jury,
some
degree
of
representation
is...
is
significant.
and
that's
a
judgment
which
is
not
empirically
demonstrable...
demonstrable.
it
is
not
something
that
can
be
proved.
it's
thought
to
be
a
part
of
the
concept.
and
i
think
that
the
notion
of
having
minorities
in
employment...
it
was
mentioned
earlier
today
that
this
court,
without
disagreement
on
this
point
by
any
member
of
the
court
in
naacp
v.
federal
power
commission,
said
of
equal
employment
regulations
by
the
federal
power
commission,
this
wasn't
part
of
your
mandate
from
congress.
it
could,
of
course,
in
the
opinion
of
justice--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--i
beg
your
pardon.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
no,
i
was...
working
the
long
way
around,
perhaps,
justice
kennedy,
to
say
that
the
reference
to
the
fcc
in
its
function
in
naacp
v.
fpc
was,
it
is
different
with
the
federal
communications
commission,
because
employment
can
be
important
in
its
impact
on
programming.
now,
surely
no
one
would
argue
that...
whether
half
of
your
janitors
or
even
half
of
your
salesmen
represent
minorities,
is
necessarily
more
significant...
is
ultimately
affecting
programming,
than
who
controls
the
station,
who
is
the
owner.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
yes.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
that
had
to
do
with
granting
permission
to
process
competing
applications
by
lotteries.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
no.
in
this
particular
case,
what
is
before
us
is
the
distressed
sale
policy
of
the
commission.
but
the
point
that
i--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--the
distress
sale
policy
was
not
specifically
mandated
by
congress...
not
authorized,
mandated
by
congress
until
three
successive
budget
acts,
the
'87
act,
the
'88
act
and
the
'89
act,
where
it
was
made
very
clear
that
congress,
which
i,
with
deference,
i
think
was
fully
informed...
maybe
not
everyone
who
voted
for
it
was
fully
informed,
but
the
relevant
people
were
fully
informed.
congress
made
the
judgment
that
we
do
not
want
those
policies
changed.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
not
just
to
reconsider
it
or
to
change
it.
i
mean,
it
is
absolutely
explicit.
you
can
decide
that
congress
didn't
make
the
kind
of
evidentiary
findings
which
has
been
indicated
from
the
bench
congress
doesn't
have
to
make,
or
you
can
say
that
it
was
wrong
because
it's
not
going
to
have
anything
to
do
with
programming.
or
you
can
say
that
you
can't
prove
that
it
did
have
to
do
with
programming.
and
there
obviously
is
force
to
all
of
that,
but,
as
the
plurality
opinion
said
in
cbs
v.
dnc,
which
was
another
case
that
strongly
indicated
the
importance
of
congress
and
the
commission
in
carrying
out
the
first
amendment
aspects...
interests
of
the
act--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--no.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
that's
right.
it's
a
part,
as
the
senate
brief
makes
so
very
clear,
of
the
fact
that
congress,
rightly
or
wrongly,
was
very
much
aware.
and
on
the
remedial
question--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--that
has
to
do--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--it's
the
only
formal
expression
that...
that
relates
directly
to
this
case,
because
it
said
don't
change
the
distress
sale
policy.
but
the
reports
leading
to
that,
and
the...
the
kerner
commission
report,
the
fcc's
1978
policy
statement--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--it
was
about
20
years
ago,
i
think.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
well,
the
fcc--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--well,
the
fcc...
when
you
say
since
that
time,
the
fcc
has
unquestionably,
with
different
members,
been
on
both
sides
of
the...
of
the
case.
i
think
that
this
court
made
very
clear
that
there's
a
big
difference
between
subordinate
agencies
and
the
congress
of
the
united
states
that
supposedly
represents
us
all,
even
if
it
sits
at
home
making
its
decisions.
and
the
fcc,
arguably,
may
be
more
like
the
school
board
in
wygant,
or
the
city
counsel
in
richmond,
or
the
board
of
regents
of
the
university
of
california
in
bakke,
but
we're
dealing
here
with
congress.
and
to
say
that
the
only
thing
that
binds
us...
binds
you...
is
the
appropriations
act,
it's
the
only
thing
that
directly
relates
to
this...
this
case...
but
in
terms
of
whether
it
was
a
considered
decision
and
whether
it
should
have
the
weight
and
deference
that
a
considered
decision
that
is
reflective
of
the
culmination
of
policy
discussions
over
many
years,
it
seems
to
me
would
be--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--justice
scalia,
i
can't
think
of
any.
i
think
that
the...
the
strange,
unique
situation
that
exists
with
the
communications
act
in
licensing,
and
the
necessity
to
be
as
unintrusive
as
possible,
suggests
that
the...
and
it's
been
done
over
the
years...
that
the
commission
has
a
great
interest
in
the
kind
of
people...
their
relationships
to
the
community,
and
these
other
factors
that
have
been
discussed,
who
will
own
the
stations.
and
i
think
that
race
in
this
situation
is
justified...
remedial
in
the
very
broad
sense
that
the
groups
that
congress
has
identified,
and
maybe
it
should
have
included
portuguese,
but
the
groups
that
congress
has
identified
have
really
and
truly
not
had
an
equal
break
in
our
society,
and
therefore,
they
may
be
somewhat
isolated--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--they
may
be
somewhat
isolated
in
their
attitudes.
and
if
they're
permitted
to
participate
in
ownership,
it
may
affect
what
goes
out
on
the
air,
and
it's
going
to
be
very
difficult
to
prove
this
minority
station
did
something
different.
but
when
one
of
the--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--and
i--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--and
i--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--and
i
respond,
your
honor,
on
the
basis
of
the
special
licensing
responsibility
that
means
that
the
people
that
are
put
in
charge
of
the
air,
like
the
decision
in...
in
red
lion
upholding
the
fairness
doctrine,
which
is
the
kind
of
interference
that
would...
we
would
all
rather
question
with
newspapers.
when
the
fairness
doctrine...
when
the
other
commission
activities
were
upheld,
it
was
on
the
notion
that
they're
going
to
make
a
try
at
assuring
that
broadcasting
is
representative.
when
this
court
in
bakke
refused
to
uphold
the
injunction
against
considering
race
on
the
medical
school
class
in
davis,
it
didn't
like
the
quotas
and
the
fixed
numbers,
it...
it
made
a
kind
of
a
race-conscious
statement.
the
truth
is,
that
while
the
constitution
may
be
colorblind,
that
race
is
with
us.
and
we
read
every
morning
in
the
newspapers
about
enormous
new
tensions
related
to
race.
and
it
seems
to
me,
to
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
on
a
considered
basis,
to
say
that
it...
it...
it
may
help
in
our
licensing
field,
and
to
avoid
program
intrusion,
to
open
up
this
field
to
ownership
of
people
who
have
been
fairly
conspicuously
subjected
to
society-wide
discrimination,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
what--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--i
think
only
with...
only
with
respect
to...
to
sensitivity.
the
people
who
own
a
newspaper
or
own
a
station
are
obviously
going
to
be
affected
by
their
background
and
environment,
and
congress
can't
run
around
taking
care
of
every
group.
but
it...
it--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--i
think
the
congressional
judgment,
while
not
applying
to
everybody,
the
congressional
judgment
is
that
groups
with
particular
kind
of
blood
were
treated
rather
differently
in
this
country
for
a
rather
long
time.
some
of
them
were
brought
over
as
slaves
and
the
rest.
i
come
from
california
and
in
california
orientals
were
not
terribly
well
treated
over
a
period
of
time.
and
therefore,
people,
even
wealthy,
brought-up-in-scarsdale
orientals
may
have
a
slightly
different
perspective
to
what's
of
interest.
the
plurality
in
cbs
v.
dnc
says
for
better
or
for
worse,
editing
is
what
editors
are
for.
i
submit
that
for
better
or
worse
this
subject
is
one
that
is...
for
better
or
for
worse...
is
what
congress
is
for.
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--i'm
not
talking
blood,
your
honor.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i
said
i'm
not
talking
blood.
i
am
not
suggesting
a
difference
in
blood.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i'm
not
aware
of
any
difference
in
blood.
what
i
was
suggesting
was
that
people...
using
justice
scalia's
term
of
blood,
that
people
with
particular
kind
of
blood
are
more
particularly
perhaps
particular
kinds
of
skins
have
been
treated
rather
differently
in
the
united
states
over
a
period
of
time
and
where
congress
is
trying
to
ameliorate
that
situation,
and
in
that
sense
what
congress
has
done
is
largely
ameliorate
it.
and
because
of
the
magnitude
of
these
problems
i
haven't
really
been
able
to
get
to
the
specifics
of
the
situation
in
shurberg,
and
i'll
try
to
do
that
in
my
reply
time.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
if
the
court
please:
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
contrary
to
the
suggestions
of
counsel,
that
mr.
shurberg
was
not
burdened
because
he
was
white.
he
was
not
treated
differently
from
a
hypothetical
black
who
at
the
same
time
that
mr.
shurberg
came
in
had
come
in
in
the
same
fashion.
they
both
would
have
been
turned
down,
because
under
the
commission's
procedures,
the
time
when
the
window
opens
for
coming
in
against
a
renewal
had
passed.
so
that
when,
after
the
1977
renewal
of
faith
center,
which
was
the
old
licensee,
after
the
time
for
that
had
passed,
it
was
too
late
for
someone
else
to
come
in,
and
if
mr.
shurberg
had
come
in
then,
which
he
didn't,
and
someone
else
had
come
in
then
who
was
black,
they
both
would
have
been
turned
down.
the
court
below,
while
it
found
the
commission's
distress
sale
unconstitutional...
policy
unconstitutional...
i
prefer
to
call
it
the
congressional
policy
now,
and
in
that
regard
i
hope
the
court
will
take
the
time
to
read
the
conference
report
on
the
'82
act
which
is
even
more
explicit
than
the
senate
report
that
i
was
reading
from.
congress
knew
what
it
was
doing,
it
knew
it
was
remediation
for
society-wide
discrimination
and
because
it
thought
it
would
help
with
programming.
counsel
referred
to
some
things
not
in
the
record
about
individuals.
i
guess
it's
permissible
for
me
to
mention
that
in
the
last
few
days
there
was
a
story
in
the
washington
newspapers
about
a
conservative
radio
station
where
the
personality
made
an
invidious
remark
referring
to
an
anchor
person
on
one
of
the
networks
as
"connie
chink".
it's
barely
possible
that
if
an
oriental
had
owned
that
station,
that
that
at
least
would
either
not
have
been
done,
or
might
not
have
been
repeated,
and
it's
even
possible
if
a
hispanic
owned
the
station.
it's
also
possible
if
a
white
owned
the
station.
but
sensitivity
is
something
that
i
think,
just
as
with
juries,
i
think
that
congress
is
entitled
to
some
interest
in
sensitivity.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
no,
i
hadn't
finished,
and
i
thank
your
honor.
mr.
shurberg
and
later
his
company
did
not
come
in
at
renewal
time
against
faith
center--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--well,
there
was
a
long,
complicated
procedure.
under
the
distress
sale
policy,
if
a
licensee's
renewal
is
designated
for
hearing
on
qualifications
issues,
then
competing
applicants
can't
come
in
until
the
matter
is
settled.
the
court
below
has
upheld
that.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
well,
he
did
in
a
way,
because
there
were
three
distress
sales.
the
first
two
fell
through--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--and
when
he
got
to
the
third
distressed
sale,
which
was
a
distress
sale
to
astroline,
the
normal
renewal
time
would
come
up,
but
the
commission
does
not
engage
in
taking
competing
applications
and
the
court
below
held
this,
when
the
case
is
in
a
hearing
status,
so
that
under
the
distress
sale
policy,
when
the
commission
approved
the
distress
sale
to
astroline,
mr.
shurberg
couldn't
come
in
and
demand
a
hearing
and
no
one
else
could,
white
or
black.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
i
think
it
made
no
difference
in
the
outcome
of
what
mr.
shurberg
was
trying
to
do.
he
never
offered
to
buy
the
station.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
well,
had
the...
had
there
been
no
distress
sale
policy,
then
what
would
have
happened
was--
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
--would
you
repeat
it?
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
it
made
no
necessary
difference
in
the
outcome
as
far
as
shurberg
was
concerned,
because
if
there
had
been
no
distress
sale
the
faith
center
renewal
hearing
on
qualifications
would
have
gone
through.
if
faith
center
won,
it
would
be
renewed.
if
faith
center
lost,
then
at
that
point
shurberg
and
everybody
else
in
the
world
could
come
and
apply.
so
that
would
have
made
a
difference,
but
it
wouldn't
necessarily
mean
that
shurberg
would
have
gotten
the
station.
he
never
offered
to
buy
it.
mr.
mr.
j.
roger
wollenberg
oh,
no.
we
didn't
have
to,
because
the
court
below...
i'm
glad
you
make
that
point,
because
this
court
has
admonished
recently
that
you
like
to
stick
to
what
the
petition
is
granted
on.
the
court
below
found
that
what
the
commission
had
done
was
entirely
appropriate
under
the
communications
act
and
its
procedures
and
there
was
no
violation
of
the
act.
it
held
only
that
the
distress
sale
policy
was
unconstitutional,
and
that's
all
that
we're
here
on.
so
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
reverse
the
court
below
on
the
question
of
whether
mr.
shurberg
would
have
been
allowed
under
the
communications
act
to
do
something
different.
what
we're
here
asking
is
that
this
court
determine
the
distress
sale
policy
is
(1)
nonrigid,
nonquota,
on
very
small...
about
four
times
a
year,
when
a
station
is
in
trouble,
the
commission
may
or
may
not
permit
a
distress
sale.
on
one
of
the
other
faith
center
things
it
didn't.
it
passes
on
each
case,
on
its
own
facts,
and
if
the
distress
sale
applicant
is
qualified,
if
the
licensee's
putative
sins
aren't
deemed
to
be
too
heinous
and
the
distress
sale
applicant
is
fully
qualified,
the
commission
may
approve
it.
it
may
not,
it
may
go
ahead
and
order
a
comparative
hearing
when,
as
and
if
the
station
comes
up
for
regular
renewal.
