ms.
juliana
drous
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
you
today
is
may
the
police
officers
seize
an
object
not
listed
on
a
warrant
when
it
is
in
play
view.
and
i
would
start
with
when
a
seizure
is
made
without
inadvertence
it
is
not
made
pursuant
to
a
search.
excuse
me,
it
is
not
a
plain-view
seizure.
it
is
made,
in
fact,
pursuant
to
a
search.
so,
we
really
don't
even
have
a
plain-view
seizure
here.
there
is...
and
the
facts
in
this
case
are,
the
police
officers
procured
a
search
warrant.
when
they
did
so,
they
carelessly
forgot
to
include
all
the
items
for
which
they
intended
to
seize.
when
they
entered
the
premises,
they
searched
for
the
items
irregardless
of
the
fact
that
they
were
not
listed
in
the
warrant
and,
in
fact,
found
the
items
that
they
were
looking
for,
except
for
the
items
in
fact
listed
on
the
warrant.
in
order
to
find
that
inadvertence
is
not
required
in
this
situation,
this
court
would
have
to
overrule
marron
v.
u.s.
the
facts
there
are
indistinguishable
from
the
facts
here.
in
that
case,
the
police
officers
entered
a
business
establishment
with
a
warrant.
when
they...
this
was
in
prohibition
times.
one
of
the
items
listed
on
the
warrant
was
liquor.
when
they
went
in
the
closet
in
which
they
believed
the
liquor
might
be,
they
found
ledgers
and
bills.
that
court,
seeing
the
issue
which...
as
simple
as
it
actually
is...
said
that
the
ledger
and
bills
were
in
fact
not
seized...
not
listed
in
the
warrant
and,
therefore,
not
subject
to
seizure.
what
the
attorney
general
of
california
asks
this
court
to
do
is
to
create
a
new
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement.
the
carelessness
exception,
the...
oh,
my
goodness,
i
forgot
to
get
the
warrant...
particularly
describing
the
items
to
be
seized.
what
that
would
do,
it
would
nullify
the
particularity
requirement
of
the
warrant
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
fourth
amendment
is
too
important
to
allow
that
to
happen.
ms.
juliana
drous
no,
your
honor.
ms.
juliana
drous
not
if
the
police
officers
intended
to
search.
the
purpose
of
the
warrant
requirement...
there
would
be
no...
police
officers
are
required
when
they
ask
for
a
search
warrant
to
particularly
describe
the
items
for
which
they
intend
to
search.
at
that
point,
it's
up
to
the
magistrate
to
make
the
decision.
if
the
police
officers
have
no
probable
cause
to
search,
they
have
no
business
searching
for
those
items.
ms.
juliana
drous
your
honor,
if
they
find
those
items
because
they
searched
for
those
items,
the
seizure
would
be
invalid.
ms.
juliana
drous
if
they
find
the
items
in
plain
view
and
the
seizure
is
inadvertent,
yes,
they
may
seize
those
items.
ms.
juliana
drous
the
fact
that
you...
that
you
look
at,
i
believe,
is...
for
inadvertence,
is
whether
or
not
the
police
officers
were
in
fact
searching
for
them.
if
they
were
searching
for
the
items
listed
on
the
warrant
and
came
upon
the
items...
the
other
items
that
they
knew
might
be
there,
that's
not
a
violation.
ms.
juliana
drous
there's
a
difference
in
saying,
we
believe
that
"b"
might
be
there,
but
don't
look
for
it.
there's
a
difference
in
that
and
saying,
well,
the
warrant
doesn't
authorize
the
search,
but
look
for
it
anyway.
of
course...
and
i
understand
what
you're
saying--
ms.
juliana
drous
--and
you're
quite
right--
ms.
juliana
drous
--that's
right.
ms.
juliana
drous
if
their
intention
in
going
into
that
residence
is
to
find
"b",
that's
a
violation.
if--
ms.
juliana
drous
--that's
correct.
ms.
juliana
drous
if
they
happen
upon
"b",
it's
a
valid
seizure.
ms.
juliana
drous
in
this...
in
this
case--
ms.
juliana
drous
--we
have...
we
have
the
testimony
of
the
police
officer
that
in...
in
fact,
when
they
entered
the
residence
they
intended
to
search
for
items
not
listed
on
the
warrant.
what
would
be
the
reason
for
getting
a
warrant
if
the
police
officer...
what
would
be
the
reason
for
police
officers
to
particularly
describe
all
the
items
to
be
seized
if
they
could
search
for
items
not
listed
on
the
warrant?
ms.
juliana
drous
there's
also
the
possessory
interest
which
the
fourth
amendment
protects,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
number
of
cases.
you...
your
honor,
you
yourself
in
hicks
v.
arizona
stated
that
the
seizure
and
search...
that
one
interest
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
not
more
important
than
the
other.
in
place...
u.s.
v.
place,
this
court
stated
that
warrantless
seizures
are
per
se
unreasonable.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
coolidge
itself
justice
stewart
stated
that
even
if
the
finding
of
contraband,
stolen
goods,
or
things
dangerous
in
themselves
are
found
without
inadvertence,
they
may
be
seized.
and
that
is
implicitly
a
recognition
that
in
those
three
items
there
is
no
possessory
interest.
you
have
no
possessory
interest
in--
ms.
juliana
drous
--that's
correct.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
order
to
enter
the
home,
even
if
it's
to
search
for
contraband
or
stolen
items,
the
warrant
must
be
obtained
to
get
into
the
home
because
that's
the
privacy
interest.
there's
a
whole
separate
possessory
interest
which
is
also
protected.
ms.
juliana
drous
your
honor,
to
answer
that,
the
attorney
general
in
his
brief
argues
against
listing.
ms.
juliana
drous
i
am...
i
am
answering
your
question.
ms.
juliana
drous
yes,
i
promise
i
will.
ms.
juliana
drous
it's
not
a
yes
or
no.
what
it
is
is...
whenever
police
officers,
as
the
attorney
general
concedes
in
his
brief,
the
more
items
that
the
police
officers
intend
to
search
for,
the
broader
the
search.
it's
going
to
have
to
be.
the
more
police
officers
you
bring
in,
the
more
invasion
on
the
privacy.
we
really
don't
know
in
this
case
if
in
fact
the
search
was
broadened
because
the
police
officers
were
looking
for
all
of
these
other
items
that
were
not
listed
in
the
warrant.
you
cannot
say
that
on
the
facts
that
we
have.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct.
ms.
juliana
drous
you
can
come
to
neither
conclusion.
ms.
juliana
drous
well,
your
honor,
the
initial
motion
made
after
the
preliminary
hearing
was
granted
by
the
magistrate
prior
to
binding
mr.
horton
over
for
trial...
the
district
attorney
then
filed
the
motion
in
the
superior
court
to
reinstate
the
evidence
which
was
granted.
the
court
of
appeals
in
california
summarily
dismissed
the
argument
saying
that
north
v.
california
does
not
follow
the
inadvertence
requirement.
ms.
juliana
drous
well,
your
honor,
in
this
case
the
facts
don't
support
the
conclusion
that
the
officers
were
simply
in
a
place
where
they
had
a
right
to
be
and
saw.
ms.
juliana
drous
--looking
for
these
things.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct.
ms.
juliana
drous
yes,
your
honor.
it
amazes
me
how
often
police
enter
a
home
and
find
all
the
drawers
open,
all
the
doors
open,
and
the
boxes
within
the
doors
and
drawers
open.
it
happens
all
the
time,
but
that's--
ms.
juliana
drous
--that's
the
way
it
is.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct.
ms.
juliana
drous
you
mean
when
an
individual
is
walking
down
the
street?
ms.
juliana
drous
if...
if
the
police
at
that
point
have
probable
cause
for
an
arrest,
the
police
officer
may
arrest
the
person
without
a
warrant--
ms.
juliana
drous
--and
the
search
of
the
person
would
then
be
pursuant
to
that
arrest.
ms.
juliana
drous
well,
because
there
you
have
an
exigent
circumstance.
you
have...
you
have
the
legitimate
exception
to
the
warrant
of
a
search
pursuant
to
an
arrest.
ms.
juliana
drous
on
the...
on
the
street?
ms.
juliana
drous
because
there
you
have
the
difference
of
the
rules
relating
to
an
arrest.
and
in...
in
that
case,
if
you
have
probable
cause
to
make
the
arrest
on
the
street...
if
you
do
not
go
into
the
home,
you
do
not
need
a
warrant.
ms.
juliana
drous
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
probable
cause
alone
will
not
support
a
warrantless
search
and
seizure.
ms.
juliana
drous
what
you
have
there,
however,
is
a
warrantless
seizure,
and
warrantless
seizures
are
not
allowed.
ms.
juliana
drous
well,
your
honor,
that's
the
second
portion
of
united
states
v.
marron,
which
has...
is...
is
no
longer
the
rule.
that
has
been
overruled
by...
excuse
me...
in...
in
marron
the
first
part
of
the
case
they...
this
court--
ms.
juliana
drous
--correct.
and
it
clearly
wasn't
in
that
case.
in
that...
that
was
during
the
time
when
the
police
officers
were
allowed
to
search--
ms.
juliana
drous
--the
entire
premises
on...
from
which
the
person
was
arrested.
ms.
juliana
drous
however,
in
this...
in
this
case
mr.
horton
was
not
present
and
none
of
the
items
were
sized
from
his
person--
ms.
juliana
drous
--you
always...
police
officers
are
always
allowed
to
search
a
person
pursuant
to
a
lawful
arrest.
ms.
juliana
drous
excuse
me?
if...
if...
if
the
officer
is--
ms.
juliana
drous
--walking
in
a
public
park--
ms.
juliana
drous
--and
it's
in
plain
view?
ms.
juliana
drous
no,
he
does
not
need
a
warrant
in
that
case.
and
in
that--
ms.
juliana
drous
--there
the
police
have...
have
made
no
illegal
seizure...
no
illegal
search.
in
this
case--
ms.
juliana
drous
--the
police
officers...
let's
go
back
to
the
beginning.
the
police
officers
got
a
warrant.
they
carelessly,
as
stated
in
the
attorney
general's
brief,
forgot
to
particularly
list
the
items
to
be
seized.
they
entered
the
home
irregardless
of
that
fact
with
the
intention--
ms.
juliana
drous
--i'm
sorry.
they
entered
the
home
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
not
at...
with
the
intention
to
search
for
these
items
even
though
they
were
not
listed
in
the
warrant.
the
actions
of
the
police
officer
were
illegal.
they
were
not
conducting
a
legal
search
at
that
point.
ms.
juliana
drous
we
don't
know
if
in
fact...
that
their
search
for
these
items
not
listed
in
the
warrant
broadened
the
search.
ms.
juliana
drous
not
when
there's
a
warrantless
seizure.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct,
your
honor.
at
least
in
california.
i
have
not
practiced
in
other
states.
but
in
california
if
there
is
a
warrantless
seizure,
a
warrantless
search,
the
burden
is
on
the
prosecution
to
show
that
in
fact
the
search
and
seizure
were
illegal.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct.
they
did.
they...
they--
ms.
juliana
drous
--well,
that's
a
legal
determination
also.
it's
a
combination.
the
courts
have
consistently
held
that
the
police
have
no
discretion
to
decide
what
is
to
be
taken,
and
abandoning
the
inadvertence
requirement
gives
police
officers
this
discretion.
there
will
be
no
need
for
them
to
request
permission
from
a
magistrate
to
search
for
each
item
for
which
they
intend
to
search.
this
will
this
nullify
the
warrant
clause
particularity
requirement.
ms.
juliana
drous
yes.
ms.
juliana
drous
in
united
states--
ms.
juliana
drous
--in
united
states
v.
place,
the
language
is
that
a
warrantless
seizure
is
per
se
unreasonable.
this
court
cannot
forget
that
there
is
also
a
possessory
interest.
it
is
true
that
this
court
has
said
that
the
privacy
interest
is
more
important,
but
there
still
remains
the
possessory
interest
which
should
be
protected.
ms.
juliana
drous
your
honor--
ms.
juliana
drous
--your
honor,
in
that
case
it
would
depend
where
the
car
was
to
be
located.
it
would
also
depend--
ms.
juliana
drous
--not...
not
in
the
driveway
of
a
home?
ms.
juliana
drous
on
the
street,
because
of
the
movability
of
automobiles,
i
think
that
that
search...
that
seizure
would
always
be
upheld.
in
each
of
the
cases
that
you
bring
there's...
there
is
an
exigency
there.
ms.
juliana
drous
in
the
case
of
automobiles,
that's
correct.
and
if
you
say
a
stolen
automobile,
there
you
have
no
possessory
interest.
a
person
has
no
possessory
interest
in
a
stolen
object.
ms.
juliana
drous
your
honor,
again,
in
that--
ms.
juliana
drous
--i'm
sorry.
again,
in
that
situation,
there
is
no
possessory
interest
in
stolen
objects.
so
there's
no
interest
to
protect
there
whatsoever.
ms.
juliana
drous
no,
i
do
not.
not
in
the
lawn
furniture
example
on
somebody's
front
lawn.
i
believe
that
a
warrant
would
be
required
in
that
situation.
absolutely.
on
the
front
lawn.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct.
which
were
not
found.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct.
and
the
items
that
they
were...
that
were
in
fact
listed
on
the
warrant
were
small
rings.
but,
again,
as
i
stated
earlier,
you
cannot
be
sure.
when
police
officers
go
in
with
the
intention
to
search
for
items,
a
longer
list
of
items
than
what...
than
what
is
on
the
warrant--
ms.
juliana
drous
--you
do
not
know.
ms.
juliana
drous
oh,
no.
they
probably
did
search
for
the
halloween
mask.
ms.
juliana
drous
in
fact,
the
police
officer
stated
as
such.
ms.
juliana
drous
that's
correct.
but
the
halloween
masks
were
not
listed
in
the
search
warrant.
your
honor,
what
we...
what
you're
creating
here
if...
if
there's
no
inadvertence
requirement,
it
allows
carelessness
in
obtaining
a
warrant.
it's
a
carelessness
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement.
ms.
juliana
drous
however,
in
this
case
in
the
closing
pages
of
the
attorney
general's
brief,
he
notes
that
the
police
officers
relied
on
the
fact
that
california
does
not
follow
the
inadvertence
requirement
so
they
didn't
think
that
it
was
necessary
to
bother
going
back
and
correcting
the
warrant
before
they
entered
the
premises
to
conduct
the
search.
there's
a
problem
with
that.
there's
a
serious
problem,
and
it
starts
with
carelessness
and
then
you
have
a
deliberate
bypass
of
the
particularity
requirements
and
the
search
and
seizure
law.
there
will
be
no
effect
to
the
particularity
requirement
if
this
sort
of
conduct
is
permitted.
this
case
actually
follows
leon.
in
leon
the...
this
court
held
that
a
good
faith
search
and
seizure,
the
seizures
that
were
obtained
in
a
good
faith
search,
will
not
be
suppressed.
there
this
court
stated,
that
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
to
deter
magistrates.
in
this
case
there
is
no
error
by
a
magistrate.
the
error
was
simply
that
of
the
police
officers.
furthermore,
leon
also
states
that
police
officers
may
not
rely
on
facially
deficient
warrants
and
describes
a
facially
deficient
warrant
as
one
failing
to
particularly
describe
the
items
to
be
seized.
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
if
this
court
is
going
to
follow
the
language
of
leon,
this
court
cannot
uphold
this
search.
finally,
the
only
effective
available
way
to
ensure
that
the
warrant
clause
is
taken
seriously
is
to
enforce
it
by
suppressing
evidence
when
it
is
thought...
when
the
warrant
clause
is
violated.
police
should
know
that
the
warrant
clause
is
not
a
mere
technicality
which
can
be
avoided
when
inconvenient
or
carelessly
forgotten.
ms.
juliana
drous
thank
you.
first
of
all,
mr.
kaye
starts
reading
from
the
record
at
page
29.
however,
immediately
before
that,
on
page
27,
the
question,
"when
you
went
to
that
residence,
what
were
you
looking
for?
"
answer,
"i
was
looking
for
items
that
were
from
mr.
wallaker
during
the
robbery
itself.
"
"i
was
looking
for
items
that
would
connect
the
person
at
the
home
to
associate
with
the
robbery,
things
used
in
the
robbery
to
obtain
the
property,
weapons,
so
forth,
clothing.
"
clearly,
we
are
not
talking
about
here
about
going
into
police
intentions.
we
are
going
into
what
the
police
actually
did,
the
conduct
of
the
police.
in
this
case
it
is
very
easy
to
ascertain
in
that
the
police
themselves
testified
as
to
what
they
did,
that
when
they
went
in,
they
searched
for
these
other
items.
second
of
all,
regarding
the
suggestion
that
the
remedy
here
of
allowing
the
police
to
secure
the
premises
while
the...
while
they
would
go
and
get
the
proper
corrected
warrant,
that
would
not
be
a
remedy
in
this
case.
segura...
when
you
look
at
the
facts
in
segura
in
which
this
court
allowed
the
securing
of
private
premises
in
order
to
obtain
a
warrant,
that
is...
also,
they
don't
say...
i
don't
believe
the
words
were
ever
used,
but
in
fact,
it's
good
faith.
and
that
case
the...
it
was
at
a
late
hour,
a
magistrate
was
not
available
to
obtain
a
warrant.
the
implication
is
that
the
police
were
worried
about
losing
the
evidence
and
that
fairly
somewhat
quick
action
had
to
be
taken
so
they
went
and
secured
the
premises
and
then
got
a
warrant.
that
is
good
faith.
again,
when
you
come
to
this
case,
there
is
no
good
faith.
what
there
is
is
police
negligence,
police
carelessness,
and
police
officers
should
not
be
allowed
to
an...
extend
an
intrusion
which
was
the
result
of
their
own
mistake,
their
own
carelessness,
their
own
deliberate
disregard
of
the
warrant
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment.
secondly,
although
we
do
not
have
the
facts
in
this
case,
it
is
correct
that
the
inadvertence
requirement
covers
two
situations.
one
where
there
is
a
warrant
and
items
are
seized
that
are
not
listed
in
the
warrant
and,
second,
where
there
is
an
arrest.
the
difference
between
payton...
payton
would
not
cover
the
situation
because
in
payton
you
have
an
arrest
warrant
allowing
the
entry
into
the
home.
what
coolidge
talks
about...
i'm
sorry,
there's
no...
what
payton
says
is
that
you
cannot
enter
a
home
without
an
arrest
warrant.
the
situation
that--
ms.
juliana
drous
--that--
ms.
juliana
drous
--absolutely.
that's...
that's
payton.
however,
there
is
nothing
in
payton
to
protect
individuals
from
police
officers
obtaining
an
arrest
warrant
in
order...
allowing
them
to
go
into
the
home
to
arrest
the
individual
and
waiting
for
an
opportune
time
when
they
have
a
feeling
that
evidence
might
be
there.
and
that's
where
inadvertence
is
still
necessary.
in
that
situation,
in
order
to
protect
fourth
amendment
rights.
in
this
case,
we
do
not
have
a
simple
oversight
or
miscalculation
of
probable
cause
by
the
police.
what
we
have
is
out
and
out
forgetfulness,
carelessness
in
not
listing...
that...
that
is
the
only
explanation.
in
fact,
that's
the
explanation
given
in
the
court
as
to
why
the
items
were
not
listed
on
the
warrant,
were
not...
why
the
affidavit
did
not
request
that
the
court
include
those
items
in
the
warrant.
and
what
you
do
have
here...
in
fact,
you
do
have
a
general
search
if
a
general
search
is
defined
as
going
in
and
searching
for
everything
that
the
police
want
to
look
for,
and
that
is
not
allowed
by
the
fourth
amendment.
the
inadvertence
requirement
is
necessary
to
protect
fourth
amendment
rights.
i
would
submit
it.
