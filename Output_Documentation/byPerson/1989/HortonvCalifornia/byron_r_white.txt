justice
white
but
nevertheless...
nevertheless,
officers
cannot
search
even
for
contraband
if...
which
is
not
listed
on
the...
on
the...
on
the
warrant.
they
have
to
be...
in
order
to
seize
them
as
a...
as
a...
as
a
plain
view
seizure,
they
have
to
be
in
a
place
where
they're
legally
entitled
to
be.
justice
white
they
cannot...
they
cannot
just
search
generally
for
things...
for...
outside
the
area
where
the
items
they're
supposed
to
find
and
are
listed
might
be.
justice
white
well,
is
there
any
indication
in
this
case
that
when
the
officers
made
this...
seized
these
articles
that
are
at
issue
that
they
were
not
in
a
place
where
they
were
not
entitled
to
be?
were
they...
were
they
in
a
place
where
they
were
entitled
to
be
when
they
made
this
seizure?
justice
white
well,
this--
justice
white
--well,
how...
you're
going
to
answer
it,
are
you?
justice
white
like
yes
or
no
or--
justice
white
--well,
you
can't
say
that
they
were...
that
they
exceeded
the
scope
of
the
search
either.
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--well,
one
of
the
items
that...
that
was
listed
in
the
warrant
was
some
halloween
masks,
weren't
they?
justice
white
they
were
not
found.
but
where
would
you...
there's
no
indication,
is
there,
that
any
of
the
items
that
were
seized
here
were
found
in
a
place
that
you
wouldn't
look
for
a...
where
you
wouldn't
look
for
a
halloween
mask,
like
on
a
shelf
or
in
a...
you'd
look
almost
anywhere
for
a
halloween
mask
until
you
found
one,
wouldn't
you?
justice
white
well,
you
don't
suggest
they--
justice
white
--you
don't
suggest
that
they
didn't
search
for
the
halloween
mask,
do
you?
justice
white
well?
justice
white
well
and
they...
and
i
suppose
they
would
look
on
shelves
and
anywhere
a
halloween
mask
might
be.
justice
white
i...
i
meant
to
talk
about
the
ring
rather
than
the
mask.
justice
white
but
the
same...
the
same
result
would
follow.
you'd
look
for
a
ring
almost
everywhere.
justice
white
yes.
got
it.
do
we...
do
we
have
a
case
expressly
which
says
that
when
you
find
what's
in
the
warrant
you
have
to
leave,
or
is
that
so
obvious
that
we
haven't
said
it?
i...
i
take
it
that
if
you
stay
after
you
find
the
listed
items,
then
it
can
become
a
general
search?
justice
white
well,
you
put
everything
in
the
warrant
that
you've
got
probable
cause
to--
justice
white
--think
is
on
the
premises.
