chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-7164,
terry
brice
horton
v.
california.
ms.
drous,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
but
the...
the
trial
court
denied
the
motion
to
suppress
and
the
court
of
appeals...
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
don't
we
have
to
assume
that
they
must
have
had
some
facts
in
mind
when
they
made
those
rulings?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
all
within
a
framework
of
people...
of
the
officer
being
lawfully
in
the
place...
having
a
lawful
right
to
be
in
the
place
where
he
was
and
seeing...
seeing
something
that
was
subject
to
seizure.
chief
justice
rehnquist
they
were--
--but--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
but
certainly
the
california
court
of
appeals,
the
california
trial
court,
the
supreme
court
of
california
in
deciding
the
north
cases
know
this
debate
about...
you
know,
is
inadvertence
a
requirement.
their
findings,
it
seems
to
me,
have
to
be
looked
at
in
the
framework
of...
of
that
kind
of
debate
in
our
court.
they're
not
saying
that
the
police
can
just
go
and
seize
anywhere.
they're
talking
about
a
place
where
the
police
have
a
lawful
right
to
be.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
ms.--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--ms.
drous,
are
you
suggesting
that
if
a
police
officer
is
walking
through
a
public
park
and
sees
a
piece
of
property
that
he
thinks
is
either
contraband
or
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
is
evidence
in
making
a
case
against
him,
he
needs
to
get
a
warrant
to...
to
seize
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
he's
walking
through
a--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why...
why
should
it
be
any...
he's
lawfully
in
the
public
park,
he's
seizing
a
piece
of
property
which
he
has
probable
cause
to
seize.
why
should
it
be
any
different?
he's
lawfully
inside
the
home
and
he
sees
a
piece
of
property
that
there's
probable
cause
to
seize?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what...
what's
illegal
about
this
search?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why...
why
don't
you
say
regardless
rather
than
irregardless?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
does
that
make
it
illegal,
unless
they
intended
to
search
in
places
where
they
were
not
otherwise
authorized
to
be
by
the
warrant?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
you
moved
to
suppress.
isn't...
isn't
the
burden
on
you
to
show
that
the
search
was
illegal
or
the
seizure
was
illegal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
you
can
come
into
court
and
say,
i
move
to
suppress
and
it's
up
to
the
government
to
show
why
the
evidence
is
admissible?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
and...
and
here
the
trial
court
in
the
california...
the
court
of
appeals
were
satisfied
the
state
had
met
that
burden.
chief
justice
rehnquist
they
must
have
thought
the
search
was
alright.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
you
say
it's
illegal,
but
you're
fighting
the
factual
determinations
of
the
lower
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
drous.
mr.
kaye.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you've
used
the
term
mr.
kaye.
how
would
you
define
pretext?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
say
underlying
motivation.
that
means
that
they're
not
really
interested
at
all
in
the
first
crime
or
that
there
are
two
motivations?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
would
think
it
would
be
very
difficult.
do
you
question
officers
about
their
underlying
intent
and
their
secondary
intent
and
that--
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kaye.
ms.
drous,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
and
you
can't
search
within
the
home
with
an
arrest
warrant.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
can
find
the
defendant
and
that's
it,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
drous.
the
case
is
submitted.
