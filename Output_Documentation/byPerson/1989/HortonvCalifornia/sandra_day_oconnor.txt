justice
o'connor
now,
what
if
the
officers
in
obtaining
and
seeking
a
search
warrant
lack
probable
cause
to
list
some
items
on
the
search
warrant
and
the
affidavit
and,
therefore,
they
don't.
now
they
go
into
the
premises
because
they
do
list
those
for
which
they
have
probable
cause.
they
go
in
and
they
see
the
items.
they
were
aware
of
those
items
but
knew
they
didn't
have
probable
cause.
are
those
found
now
in
plain
view?
justice
o'connor
no?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
have
put
to
you
the
possibility
that
there
may
be
several
items,
some
of
which
they
have
probable
cause
to
get
a
warrant
to
search,
and
some
they
don't.
they
know
they
don't
have
probable
cause
for
everything
so
they
don't
list
everything.
but
when
they
go
to
the
house,
they
find
it.
justice
o'connor
no,
they
find
it
because
it's
in
plain
view
when
they
enter
pursuant
to
a
valid
search
warrant
for
other
items.
justice
o'connor
but
they
knew
they
were
there,
likely
to
be
there,
but
they
lacked
probable
cause
to
include
them
in
the
warrant
requirement.
justice
o'connor
but
once
you
have
a
warrant
to
enter
the
home
and
your
concern
is
with
the
possessory
interest,
why
isn't
that
met
if
the
officers
have
probable
cause
to
seize
the
items?
justice
o'connor
it's
not
warrantless.
they
have
a
warrant
to
enter
the
home.
so,
there
is
no
additional
burden
on
the
privacy
interest
at
stake.
what
you're
concerned
about
is
the
possessory
interest
in
these
other
items.
and
why
isn't
that
met
by
the
probable
cause
that
the
officers
had?
justice
o'connor
there
would
still
be
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
police,
i
suppose,
to
have
a
warrant
that
would
properly
enable
them
to
describe
the
scope
of
their
search.
and
so
i
would
think
it
would
be
in
their
interest
to
describe
still
with
particularity
what
it
is
they
think
they
have
probable
cause
to
find.
