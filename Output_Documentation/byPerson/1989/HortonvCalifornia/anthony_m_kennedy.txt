justice
kennedy
well,
that...
that's
not
correct.
warrantless
seizures
are
allowed
of
objects
within
the
possession
and
the
control
of
the
arrestee,
which
is
the
way
i
understand
united
states
v.
marron.
you
said
we're
going
to
have
to
overrule
that
case.
the...
the
objects
there
were
admissible
into
evidence
and
they
were
not
described
in
the
warrant.
justice
kennedy
if...
if
it's
within
control
according
to
the
chimel
doctrine,
it
would
have
been
admissible,
would
it
not?
justice
kennedy
but--
justice
kennedy
--yes,
but...
but
you--
--well,
are
you--
--say
that
it
must
be
within
the
specifications
of
the
warrant
to
be
seized
and
i've
just
given
you
one
example
where
that
is
not
so.
justice
kennedy
suppose
you...
the
police
stay
on
the
premises
after
they've
found
all
the
listed
items
on--
justice
kennedy
--the
warrant,
i
take...
it
take
it
then
it's
a
general
search.
justice
kennedy
and
there
was
no
contention
that
that
happened
here?
justice
kennedy
well,
is
it
permissible
to
search...
execute
a
search
warrant
for
crime
"a"
if
there
is
probable
cause
for
that
if
your
real
intent
is
to
search
for
evidence
of
crime...
is
to...
is
to
look
for
evidence
of
crime
"b"
that
might
be
in
plain
view?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
seem
to
be
conceding
it.
that's
a
problem.
