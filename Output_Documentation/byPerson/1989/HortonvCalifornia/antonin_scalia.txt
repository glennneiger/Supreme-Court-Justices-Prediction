justice
scalia
how
do
you...
how
do
you
instruct
these
police
officers
when
you
send
them
out?
let's...
let's...
you
know,
they...
they
know
the
thing's
"a",
are
there,
and...
and
they
have
probable
cause
so
that's
in
the
warrant.
thing
"b"
they
suspect
may
be
there.
so,
when
i
send
them
out
with
their
warrant,
what
do
i
tell
them?
don't...
don't
look
for
"b"
whatever
you
do.
how
can
you...
can
you
erase
from
your
mind
the
notion
that
"b"
may
be
there?
i
mean,
this
is
a
weird
rule
you're
proposing
for...
for...
the
police
have
to
act
in
some
realistic
fashion.
how
can
they
possibly
act
that
way?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
you--
justice
scalia
--you
can
tell
them,
don't
look
in
any
place
where
"a"
wouldn't
be
just
because
you
think
that
"b"
might
be
there.
you
can
tell
them
that.
justice
scalia
but
how
can
you
tell
them,
while
you're
looking
for
"a",
for
pete's
sake,
don't
think
"b"?
that's
totally
unrealistic.
and
yet...
and
yet
you
say
that
if
they're
thinking
"b"
while
they're
looking
for
"a",
it's
bad.
justice
scalia
i
don't
know.
their
intention
is
to
execute
the
warrant
which
let's
them
look
for
"a".
justice
scalia
they
also
know
that
"b"
might
be
there.
justice
scalia
well,--
justice
scalia
--happen
upon
it.
i--
justice
scalia
--the
basic
reason,
i
think,
is
to...
is
to
describe
the
scope
of
the
search.
if...
you
know,
if...
if...
if
you're
looking
for
an
elephant,
you
can't
look
in
drawers.
so
where's
there
an
elephant
on
the
search
warrant,
searching
through
drawers
is
beyond
the
proper
scope
of
the
search.
isn't
that
a
good
enough
reason?
justice
scalia
ms.
drous,
could
you
tell
me
why...
why...
why
would
we...
we
don't
have
an
inadvertence
requirement
for
dispensing
with
a
seizure
warrant
elsewhere,
do
we?
i
mean,
if
the
police
suspect,
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
somebody
will
be
walking
down
the
street
with
contraband,
with
illegal
drugs
or
something
of
that
sort,
do--
justice
scalia
--must
they
go
get
a
seizure
warrant
before
they
can
come
up
and
even
though
they
lay
in
wait
fully
expecting
him
to
come,
do
they
have
to
get
a
seizure
warrant?
justice
scalia
yes.
they...
they...
they
have
very
reliable
information
from
an
informant
that
he'll
be
walking
down
the
street
with
cocaine.
they
lay
and
wait
for
him
and
see
the
cocaine,
go
over
and
seize
it.
is
that...
is
that
unlawful?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
but...
even
though
they
had
full
knowledge
and
could
have
gotten
a
warrant
for
the
seizure
you
don't
require
advertence
in
that...
inadvertence
in
that
situation,
do
you?
justice
scalia
it
isn't
an
exigent
circumstance
because
they
could
have
gotten
a
warrant.
almost
by
definition
an
exigent
circumstance
means
you
have
no
time
to
get
a
warrant.
here
they
knew
he
was
going
to
be
there
with
cocaine
but
they
didn't
get
a
warrant.
justice
scalia
yeah.
see,
i
can't
see
why
you
need
an
inadvertent
requirement
in
the
context
in
this
case
and
don't
require
it
on
the
street.
justice
scalia
ms.
drous,
have
we...
have
we
ever...
have
we
ever
held
that...
that
the
constitution
requires
a
warrant
for
a
seizure
without
a...
without
a
search?
justice
scalia
i
know
we
have...
we
have
for
an
arrest
and
we
have
for
a
search
and
seizure,
but...
but
what...
what
case
says
it
just...
just--
justice
scalia
--where
there's
probable
cause,
i
mean.
where
there's
probable
cause.
justice
scalia
so,
it...
so,
it
follows
then...
i'm...
i'm...
i
don't
know
what
the
answer
is.
if...
if
the
police
have
very
reliable
information
that
a
stolen
car
is
going
to
be
at
a
particular
location,
they
cannot
just
go
to
that
location
seeing
the
stolen
car,
seize
it.
they...
they
would
have
to
get
a...
get
a
seizure
warrant.
justice
scalia
there's
no
search
involved.
it's
just
a
seizure.
justice
scalia
it's
going
to
be
on
the
street.
justice
scalia
no.
just
on
the
street.
justice
scalia
it's
not
an
exigency
that...
of
the
sort
that
prevents
a
warrant
from
being
obtained.
they...
they
knew
the
car
was
going
to
be
there
in
plenty
of
time
to
get
a
warrant.
see,
i...
i
suspect
you
don't
need
a
warrant
in
that
situation
and...
and
i
think
our
law
may
not
require
anything
other
than
probable
cause
when
there
is
to
be
a
seizure
though
not
a
search.
at...
at
least,
i
don't
know
a
case
that
contradicts
that.
justice
scalia
that...
that
principle
would
serve
as
a
deterrent
to
just
leaving
things
off
the
warrant.
in
other
words,
there...
there
is
an
incentive
to
list
everything
that
you're
interested
in
in
the
warrant
because
if
you
don't
and
you
find
all
the
other
things
before
that
one,
you're
going
to
have
to
leave
the
premises.
