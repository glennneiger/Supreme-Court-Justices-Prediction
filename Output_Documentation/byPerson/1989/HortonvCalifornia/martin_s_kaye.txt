mr.
martin
s.
kaye
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
by
citing
to
the
court
the
joint
appendix
at
page
29
where
the
officer
who
conducted
this
search
is
asked,
"when
you
searched
the
residence
of
mr.
horton
were
you
looking
for
that
jewelry,
that
stolen
property?
"
"yes,
i
was".
"in
the
course
of
that
search,
did
you
come
upon
some
weapons
that
you
based...
that
you
based
your
discussions
with
the
victim
on?
"
the
scope
of
the
search
has
never
been
challenged
in
this
case.
it
was
not
challenged
on
appeal
and
it
is
not
challenged
in
this
court.
it
is
only
the
inadvertence
requirement
that
is
raised
here.
second
of
all,
i'd
like
to
correct
something
that
justice
white
said.
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
yes.
the--
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
--precisely.
precisely.
when
you
have
something
that
small,
obviously
the
scope
of
the
search
is
going
to
be
quite
intense.
and
all
those
other
items
were
listed
in
the
affidavit
through
the
police
reports.
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
if
you
stay
after
you
find--
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
--yes.
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
that...
we
would
concede
that
once
the
listed
items
are
found
the
search
much
seize.
there
is
no
more
authority
despite
what
the
affidavit
shows.
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
no.
none.
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
precisely,
your
honor.
there's
an
incentive
to
put
everything
in
the
warrant
in
order
to
make
sure...
ensure
that
the
scope
of
the
search--
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
--well,
certainly.
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
sure,
i'm
assuming
probable
cause.
to
ensure
that
the
scope
of
the
search
will
be
to
the
greatest
extent
possible.
the
purpose
of
the
inadvertence
requirement
as
announced
in
coolidge
was
to
enforce
two
distinct
purposes
of
the
warrant
clause.
to
eliminate
altogether
searches
without
probable
cause
and
to
limit
the
scope
of
searches
deemed
necessary
to
the
smallest
extent
possible.
neither
of
those
purposes
was
violated
in
this
case.
the
police
obtained
a
valid
warrant
for
three
rings,
particularly
described
rings.
they
confined
the
scope
of
their
search
to
the
area
and
time
authorized
by
the
warrant.
they
had
a
lawful
basis
to
be
where
they
could
see
the
other
property.
there
was
no
general
search
in
this
case.
in
fact,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
the
facts
show
that
there
were
a
number
of
other
firearms
that
were
found
in
the
premises
that
were
not
seized
because
they
did
not
fit
the
description
in
the
affidavit.
i
think
it's
useful
to
examine
coolidge
in
its
historical
context.
at
the
time
of
coolidge
the
court
was
deeply
divided
over
two
issues,
the
broad
scope
of
searches
incident
to
arrest
and
the
allowance
of
searches...
of
arrests
in
the
home
without
a
warrant.
hence,
the
basis
for...
hence,
the
basis
for
the
citation
to
trupiano
in
coolidge.
neither
of
those
concerns
are
present
anymore.
in
chimel
v.
california
the
scope
of
searches
was
limited
to
a
small
extent
to
the
reaching
area
of
the
defendant,
and
in
payton
v.
new
york,
the
court
required
a
warrant
for
an
arrest
in
a
home.
therefore,
there
is
no
danger
of
the
police
planning
to
arrest
someone,
waiting
until
he
goes
into
his
home,
and
then
permitting
them
to
make
a
very
broad
search
without
any
warrant
whatsoever.
in
our
view,
the
probable
cause
requirement
protects
petitioner's
interest
in
the
possession
of
these
items.
unlike
an
unlawful
search,
the
rupture
of
privacy
cannot
be
repaired.
but
property
can
be
restored
to
the
victim.
if
the
police
are
required
to
return
for
a
warrant,
petitioner's
interest
in
possession
would
still
be
interfered
with
to
the
same
degree.
stationing
an
officer
to
guard
the
property
from
loss
or
destruction
while
the
warrant
is
sought
means
that
petitioner
would
still
be
deprived
of
possession
or
use
of
that
item.
and,
in
fact,
if
stationing
an
officer
there
is
required
in
order
to
guard,
then
the
privacy
intrusion
would
be
extended.
it
seems
an
odd
way
to
protect
the
petitioner's
rights
to
extend
the
intrusion
on
his
privacy.
in
texas
v.
brown,
the
court
indicated
some
concern
with
a
pretext
search.
if
that
is
the
case,
the
court
ought
to
meet
it
squarely
rather
than
through
use
of
the
inadvertence
requirement.
the
coolidge
requirement
does
not
apply
to
contraband,
stolen
property
or
items
dangerous
in
themselves.
therefore,
many
pretext
searches
are
not
even
included
in
the
requirement.
second
of
all,
if
inadvertence
is
to
mean
the
lack
of
probable
cause,
then
an
officer
who
obtains
a
warrant
to
search
for
evidence
of
crime
"a"
purely
as
a
pretext
to
look
for
evidence
of
crime
"b",
would
not
be
deterred
because
if
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
the
evidence
of
crime
"b",
the
seizure
would
be
inadvertent.
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
well,
the
court
has
never...
has
never
discussed
that--
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
--no,
i'm
not
conceding
it.
to
the
contrary.
in
scott
v.
united
states,
the
court
indicated
that
the
officers
underlying
intent
and
motivation
is
irrelevant
to
the
ascertainment
of
whether
there
was
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
that
is
to
be
measured
by
the
objective
conduct
and
if...
the
conduct
in
that
case
would
be
objectively
reasonable
because
they
would
have
had
a
search
warrant
in
the
first
place.
the
inadvertence
requirement
sweeps
too
broadly.
it
would
include
searches
as
the
present
case
in
which
there
is
no
hint
of
pretext.
here
the
police
revealed
all
the
information
they
had
to
the
magistrate.
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
the
lower
courts
generally
agree
that
a
pretext
situation
is
where
you
are
obtaining
permission
to
search
or
arrest
for
one
crime
when
the
underlying
motivation
is
to
look
for
evidence
of
a
second
crime.
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
well,
that's
not
clear.
if
they're
not
interested
at
all
in
the
first
crime,
then
that's
a
different
situation,
granted.
but
that's
a
very
difficult
thing
to
decide.
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
precisely.
it's...
the
court
would
get
into
the
thicket.
as
it
put...
put
it
in
leon,
the
court
is
not
inclined
to
get
into
an
expedition
into
the
minds
of
police
officers.
the
court
viewed
it
as
a
grave
and
fruitless
misallocation
of
resources.
and
the
court...
if
there
was
more
than
one
motivation,
then
the
court
would
be
having
to
determine
which
one
was
the
dominant
motivation.
the
courts
are
simply
not
equipped
to
make
such
determinations.
the
inadvertence
rule
punishes
the
police
for
oversight
or
miscalculation
of
probable
cause.
the
error
in
this
case
is
benign.
it's
not
deliberate,
it's
not
pretextual.
the
court
has
said
that
the
police
do
not
have
to
guess
at
their
peril
the
precise
moment
when
probable
cause
exists.
the
inadvertence
rule
places
the
police
in
just
such
peril.
in
this
case,
the
police
were
properly
on
the
premises
and
they
had
probable
cause
for
their
seizure.
we
would
submit
that
under
those
circumstances
there
simply
is
no
basis
to
suppress
the
evidence.
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
what
was
the
value?
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
i
don't
know
if
the
record
reveals.
in
terms
of
monetary
value?
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
no.
he
was
not
tried
for
possession
of
stolen
property.
the
rings
were
never
found.
mr.
martin
s.
kaye
well,
it
was
never
discovered
during
the
search.
