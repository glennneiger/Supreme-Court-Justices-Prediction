mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
second
question
in
this
case
considers
whether
the
important
societal
interest
in
protecting
children
at
risk
of
serious
injury
can
overcome
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
at
two
levels,
this
issue
has
extreme
ramifications.
first,
this
court
must
decide
whether
the
needs
of
my
client,
an
infant
who
is
defenseless,
who
has
been
previously
abused
and
whose
whereabouts
have
been
unknown
for
the
past
18
months,
must
be
abandoned
in
favor
of
an
unprecedented
extension
of
the...
of
the
fifth
amendment.
second,
if
this
court
decides
against
maurice,
family
courts
and
juvenile
courts
across
the
country
will
lose
their
parens
patriae
authority
to
protect
thousands
upon
thousands
of
children
from
serious
abuse.
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
your
honor,
limited
use
immunity
is
available
only
upon
the
consent
or
the
request
of
the
state's
attorney.
the
state's
attorney
was
not
a
party
to
the
juvenile
court
proceeding.
the
state's
attorney
has
discretion
whether
his
or
her
law
enforcement
interests
outweigh
the
needs
of
the
juvenile
court.
the
juvenile
court
does
not
have
the
power
to
confer
use
immunity
nor
did
any
of
the
other
parties
in
the
juvenile
court
proceeding.
similarly,
in
other
states
where
use
immunity
may
not
be
available,
that
solution...
would
not
assist
the
juvenile
court
at
all.
in
this
particular
case,
however,
limited
use
immunity
would
satisfy
the
need
for
maurice's
production,
but
it
is
a
speculative
assumption.
and
if
we
look
at
the
availability
of
immunity
for
every
conflict
which
arises
between
civil
regulatory
systems
and
potential
incriminations,
then
the
entire
line
of
cases
of
this
court,
dating
from
united
states
v.
sullivan
in
the
income
tax
reporting
system
through
wartime
price
regulation
in
shapiro
v.
united
states,
on
through
deterrence
of
drunk
driving
and
traffic
accident
reporting
in
byers
v.
california,
would
automatically
fall
out.
immunity
is
not
the
answer
that
this
court
has
held
to
those
fundamental
clashes
between
civil
regulation
and
potential
incriminating
disclosures.
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
justice
blackmun,
the
mother,
through
her
counsel,
informed
the
court
that
the
child
would
be
produced
and
that
the
mother
was
on
her
way.
unfortunately,
the
mother
never
appeared
in
court
and
the
mother
never
produced
the
child.
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
her
counsel.
in
the
view
of
the
court
below,
the
mother
was
lying
to
the
court
and
to
her
counsel.
your
honor,
the
impact
of
this
case
is
dramatic.
in
every
state
juvenile
courts
would
lose
the
power
to
compel
parents
who
are
suspected
of
maltreating
their
children
to
bring
their
children
to
court.
any
element
of
suspicion
would
be
enough
to
block
the
juvenile
court's
inherent
or
statutory
powers.
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
ordinarily,
and
in
maryland,
the
statute
governing
child
protective
services
investigations
has
a
probable
cause
requirement
written
into
it
such
that
a
social
worker
with
a
police
officer
can
go
into
a
home
when
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
child
is
in
danger.
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
that's
correct,
your
honor.
however--
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
--that
is
the
ordinary
course
in
emergencies.
however,
there
are
cases
where
reports
of
abuse...
of
possible
abuse
or
neglect
come
in
through
other
methods.
in
other
words,
independent
agencies,
such
as
a
school
or
a
hospital,
may
phone
in
a
report.
the
social
worker
or
the
police
go
out
to
investigate
but
no
one
is
home,
they're
not
let
in,
they're
not
able
to
find
the
child.
but
those
cases
arise
and
produce
the
need
to
go
to
court
to
compel
the
parent
to
produce
the
child.
one
can
imagine
a
sexual
abuse
case
where
a
report
comes
from
the
school
of
extreme
behavioral
problems
and
possible
statements
of
sexual
abuse.
the
social
worker
goes
out
to
the
home
and
not
gained
access
to
the
child.
in
that
situation,
the
only
other
authority
which
can
assist
is
the
juvenile
court
or
the
family
court.
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
your
honor,
my
client's
father
was
killed
approximately
a
year
and
a
half
ago
to
two
years
ago...
i
believe
in
march
of
1988...
in
a
drug-related
shooting
incident.
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
no,
your
honor,
they
were
not
married.
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
no,
your
honor.
what
we
believe
will
happen
is
if
the
juvenile
court
loses
its
power
to
compel
parents
to
produce
children,
then--
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
--not
on
that
scale,
but
that
power
is
the
authority
underlying
social
worker
access
to
children
and
into
parents'
homes.
if
in
fact
social
workers
cannot
tell
parents
that
if
they
do
not
cooperate,
they
can
be
arrested
and
brought
to
court
to
bring
their
children,
then
parents
will
have
a
much
greater
incentive
to
not
cooperate.
they
will
essentially
be
immunized
by
the
fifth
amendment.
there
will
be
no
power
from
the
juvenile
court
to
compel,
and
the
social
worker
will
be
resigned
to
finding
the
child
through
the
social
worker's
own
wiles.
that's
met
that--
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
--your
honor,
the
testimonial
inferences
that
could
be
drawn
from
the
production
of
this
child
are
slight,
just
as
they
would
be
in
that
situation.
in
both
cases
there
is
a
legal
order
of
custody.
in
both
cases
there
is
a
presumption
of
continuing
custody
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
in
both
cases
there
is...
there
are
avenues
for
the
parent
to
comply
with
the
request
that
the
child
be
produced
for
inspection
without
in
any
way
involving
the
parent
directly
in
the
child's
production.
ms.
bouknight
has
alternatives
available
to
her
which
she
has
not
chosen
to
exercise.
and
those
alternatives
do
not
involve
any
testimonial
incrimination.
she
could
use
her
lawyers
to
produce
the
child.
she
could
arrange
for
the
child's
production
anonymously.
she
could
use
another
privileged
confidante.
those
have
not
been
utilized
by
her,
and
yet
none
would
involve
any
type
of
testimonial
incrimination.
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
yes,
your
honor.
this
case
squarely
falls
within
california
v.
byers.
in
that
case,
the
court
upheld
a
less
vital
state
interest,
the
adjudication
of
civil
property
damage
claims
against
appreciably
stronger
fifth
amendment
interests.
byers
held
that
neutral
noncriminal
statutes
can
compel
incriminating
information
if
they
are
part
of
a
civil
regulatory
system
which
in
no
way
targets
criminal
activity.
that
was
a
plurality
opinion,
and
justice
harlan
joined
that
opinion
to
create
a
majority
by
establishing
a
balancing
test
when
valid
civil
governmental
interests
are
asserted
against
possible
fifth
amendment
incrimination.
justice
harlan
phrased
the
balance
test
by
looking
at
the
nature
of
the
governmental
interest,
the
nature
of
the
type...
or
the
type
of
incrimination
which
would
incur,
and,
finally,
the
necessity
for
the
information
which
would
be
produced.
under
either
approach,
the
plurality
approach,
or
justice
harlan's
approach,
this
case
amply
satisfies
those
tests.
in
this
case
we
have
a
specific
neutral
court
which
is
acting
not
to
further
any
type
of
criminal
prosecution
but
only
to
serve
one
purpose,
and
that's
to
ensure
my
client's
safety.
and,
second,
a
court
exercising
authority
specifically
granted
to
it
by
a
neutral
statue
within
an
entire
regime--
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
--your
honor--
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
--your
honor,
byers
focused
on
the
general
risk
or
the
general
degree
of
incrimination.
byers,
the
defendant
in
that
case,
had
a
tremendous
personal
fear
of
incrimination.
he
was
already
under
indictment
for
two
counts.
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
information
he
was
required
to
provide,
his
name
and
address,
would
be
vital
elements
within
any
prosecution
against
him.
nevertheless,
both
the
plurality
and
justice
harlan's
approach
looked
at
the
statutory--
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
--that's
correct.
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
your
honor,
the
concerns
that
could
prompt
this
juvenile
court
to
exercise
its
statutory
authority
are
not
limited
to
instances
of
extreme
abuse.
they
could
extend
to
the
whole
host
of
issues
which
the
juvenile
court
addresses
on
a
regular
basis.
delinquency
cases,
truancy
cases,
runaway
cases,
neglect
cases,
are
all
part
and
parcel
of
the
juvenile
court's
docket.
all
of
those
cases
could
invoke
or
could
require
a
child's
production
to
court.
and
a
child's
production
to
court
is
not
necessarily
to
prove
that
the
child
has
been
abused.
it
could
be
to
facilitate
the
child's
placement
into
substitute
care
which
in
fact
was
part
of
the
reason
for
the
court's
order
here.
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
the
court
divested
the
mother
of
custody
in
order
that
the
child,
the
infant,
be
placed
in
emergent
foster
care.
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
your
honor,
if
in
fact
the
respondent
is
not
able
to
comply
with
the
court
order,
it
is
her
duty
to
inform
the
court
that
she
is
no
longer
able
to
comply.
essentially
she
is
required
to
plead
impossibility.
this
court,
in
the
case
of--
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
--your
honor,
the
mere
statement
that
she
is
unable
to
comply
would
not
necessarily
be
incriminating.
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
that,
of
course,
would
be
up
to
the
judge's
discretion.
under
the
united
states
v.
rylander--
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
--well,
your
honor,
she
still
has
privileged
intermediaries
she
could
utilize.
but
if
we
look
at
the
scenario
of
the
child
being
dead--
mr.
mitchell
y.
mirviss
--her
explanation
for
why
she
cannot
comply
is
not
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
under
united
states
v.
rylander
this
court
specifically
held
that
a
party
unable
to
comply
with
a
valid
unappealed
court
order
is
not
able
to
assert
the
fifth
amendment
as
an
excuse
for
explaining
to
the
court
why
she
cannot
comply
with
its
valid
court
order.
and
that
principle
extends
back
for
decades
and
decades
for
the
burden
that
any
individual
must
face
when
confronted
with
a
court
order
or
even
a
burden
of
persuasion
that
an
individual
bears
in
this
civil
or
criminal
proceeding.
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
shift
the
burden
of
proof
upon
the
state
or
the
burden
of
persuasion
away
from
her.
i
would
like
to
also
point
out
that
in
addition
to
the
alternatives
the
mother
has
in
this
case,
the
actual
order
of
the
court
is
very
limited
in
terms
of
its
incursion
upon
the
fifth
amendment.
the
mother
is
not
required
to
testify.
the
mother
is
not
required
to
make
any
type
of
oral
disclosure.
she
need
not
provide
records
or
documents
which
convey
the
thoughts,
beliefs,
or
feelings
of
her.
those
are
all
the
fundamental
principles
that
this
court
has
upheld
in
looking
at
acts
of
production.
your
honor,
my
time
is
up.
that
will
conclude
my
remarks.
