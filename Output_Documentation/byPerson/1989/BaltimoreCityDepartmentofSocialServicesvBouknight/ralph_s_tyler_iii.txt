mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
questions.
first,
whether
a
court
order
directing
a
parent
to
produce
her
child
compels
incriminating
testimony
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
and,
secondly,
whether
in
this
case
the
mother's
privilege
claim
is
overcome
by
the
important
societal
interest
in
protecting
a
child
plainly
at
risk.
i
will
address
the
first
of
these
issues
and
the
child's
counsel
will
address
the
second.
the
child
who
is
the
subject
of
this
case
was
born
in
october
1986.
as
of
four
months
of
age
he
had
been
hospitalized
twice
with
confirmed
fractures
of
major
bones.
during
his
second
hospitalization
his
mother
was
observed
shaking
him
and
dropping
him
into
his
crib
while
he
was
in
a
cast.
the
baltimore
city
department
of
social
services
filed
a
petition
with
the
juvenile
court
in
baltimore
asserting
that
maurice
was
a
child
in
need
of
assistance,
as
defined
by
maryland
law.
a
court
hearing
was
held
on
that
petition
at
which
all
parties
were
represented
by
counsel
and
the
parties
stipulated
to
the
facts
of
the
petition.
maurice
was
placed
in
foster
care,
where
he
remained
for
some
months
when
the
order
was
modified
to
return
physical
custody
to
the
mother.
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
it
certainly
has
absolutely
the
same
tragic
facts,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
i
think...
certainly
with
benefit
of
hindsight
it
was
a
great
error
to
return
the
child.
the
record
reflects
that
the
agency
opposed
that
before
the
master,
but
did
not
take
an
appeal.
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
well,
i
would
have
to
respectfully
answer
no,
it
wasn't
apparent.
the
parties
determined
and
the
court
concurred
that
the
child
should
be
returned.
at
a
further
hearing
in
the
case
in
august,
the
parties,
again
all
represented
by
counsel,
agreed
to
an
order
of
protective
supervision
finding
maurice
to
be
a
child
in
need
of
supervision
under
the
supervision
of
the
department
of
social
services
and
the
mother
had
physical
custody.
importantly,
that
order
provided,
among
other
things,
that
the
mother
was
required
to
cooperate
with
the
department.
she,
represented
by
counsel,
agreed
to
that
order.
agency
personnel
have
last
seen
this
child
in
december...
in
september
of
1987.
in
april
of
'88,
after
making
repeated
efforts
to
locate
the
child,
the
agency
filed
a
petition
in
the
juvenile
court
in
baltimore
seeking
a
review
of
the
court
order
and
ordered
a
show
of
cause
and
a
petition
for
contempt.
after
arrest,
the
mother,
with
counsel
at
her
side,
told
the
juvenile
court
that
the
child
was
with
the
mother's
sister
in
dallas.
this
proved
to
be
false
and
she
gave
other
information
as
to
the
child's
whereabouts,
which
similarly
proved
to
be
false.
the
court
held
her
in
contempt
and
sent
her
to
jail
providing
that
she
could
purge
herself
of
contempt
by
either
producing
the
child
before
the
court
or
revealing
his
exact
whereabouts.
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
she
is
in
the
jail
in
baltimore
city,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
not
in
our
view,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
--because,
justice
o'connor,
in
the
cases
where
the
court
has
said
that
there
would
be
testimonial
content
to
an
act
of
production,
the
identified
variables
have
been
existence,
possession,
authentication.
and
if
those
items
are
foregone
conclusions
or
not
in
dispute,
which
we
submit
is
this
case,
then
the
act
of
production
has
no
testimonial
effect.
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
it
is,
of
course,
true
that
we
do
not
know
where
the
child
is.
but
what
we
do
now
and
what
has
never
been
disputed
in
the
case
is
that
the
mother
has
custody
of
the
child.
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
she...
she
certainly
had
physical
custody.
she
affirmatively
asserted
that
she
had
custody
before
the
juvenile
court.
but
for
the
juvenile
court's--
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
--well,
what
she...
what
she
did
concede,
justice
kennedy,
at
the
hearings
in
the
juvenile
court
in
april
of
'88
is,
first,
her
counsel
on
her
behalf
represented
that
the
child
was
fine
and
that
there
was
no
basis
for
concern.
secondly,
she
was
then
arrested
and
brought
before
the
court
and
gave
the
court
an
address
in
dallas
where
the
child
was
to
be
found.
she
gave
other
officials
information
about
the
child
being
with
a
relative
in
baltimore
or...
and
relatives
elsewhere.
at
no
point
has
she
asserted
an
inability
to
comply
with
the
order
and...
nor
has
she
ever
claimed
that
there
has
been
an
intervening
custodial
relationship
which
somehow
relieved
her
of
her
undisputed
custody.
rather--
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
--well--
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
--well,
it
wouldn't
be
in
our
view,
justice
o'connor,
because
this
is
the
only
living
parent
of
a
child
who
at
the
time
the
case
was
in
the
juvenile
court
was
19
months
old.
there
is
no
one
else
that
the
state
can
look
to
and,
indeed,
she
has
pointed
us
to
no
one
else.
so--
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
--your
honor,
the
status
of
immunity
under
maryland
law
has
changed
dramatically
while
this
case
has
been
pending
and
as
of
april...
as
of
july
of
'89
there
is
a
broader
immunity
statute
in
maryland.
but--
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
--well,
our
objection,
your
honor,
is
that
she
has
asserted
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
which
we
claim
does
not
exist.
if
she
were
asked
to
stand
in
a
lineup,
she
could
not
say
to
the
state
of
maryland,
i
will
not
do
so
until
give
me
immunity,
because
that
fifth
amendment
privilege
she
does
not
have.
it
is
our
view
that
that
is
this
case.
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
yes.
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
would
now
be
possible,
your
honor.
it
was
not
possible
at
the
time
the
case
was
pending
in
the
juvenile
court.
but
i
would
stress
that
the
state
that
the
state--
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
--yes.
but,
again,
i
would
stress
that
first
we
should
not
be
put
to
that
choice
until
she
prevails
entirely
in
this
court
as
would
any
person
who
was
asked
to
perform
an
act
if
it
is
not
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment.
the
state
should
not
be
required
to
provide
immunity
because,
for
example,
as
the
court
noted
in
braswell,
there
are
costs
to
doing
so.
the
costs
of
granting
immunity
should
be
considered
and
the
state
should
not
be
required
to
grant
it
until
she
absolutely
prevails
here.
but
the
state's
position,
we
believe,
is
supported
really
by
two
lines
of
authority
in
this
court.
first,
the
schmerber
line
of
authority
and
then
the
fisher
and
act
of
production
cases.
the
schmerber
line
certainly
established
that
the
general
rule
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
relieve
a
person
of
the
obligation
to
produce
incriminating
evidence.
and
we
submit
that
the
great
flaw
in
the
decision
below,
and
a
flaw
which
is
largely
conceded
in
the
brief
of
the
respondent,
is
to
put
all
the
weight
in
the
case
on
the
potential
incrimination
of
producing
the
child
when
in
fact
that
is
only
half
the
test
and
that
we
do
not
dispute
that
it
may
have
some
incriminating
effect.
but
that
does
not
make
it
testimonial
any
more
than
a
person
is
relieved
of
the
obligation
to
provide
a
blood
sample,
a
handwriting
exemplar,
stand
in
a
lineup,
and
so
on.
further,
the
elements
in
the
act
of
production
cases
of
existence,
possession,
authentication
are
here
not
in
dispute.
maurice
was
with
his
mother.
she
has
never
claimed
to
the
contrary.
she
has
never
claimed
that
she
cannot
comply
with
the
court
order.
her
sole
defense
in
this
case
and
the
holding
of
the
maryland
court
was
not
that
she
could
not
comply,
but
that
she
need
not
comply.
that
the
order
was...
was
void
the
moment
it
was
entered.
and
that,
in
our
view,
is
a
dangerous
and
unwarranted
extension
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege.
to
hold
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law
that
a
parent
cannot
be
required
to
produce
her
child
in
court
because
to
do
so
would
constitute
testimony,
would
ultimately
remove
from
the
juvenile
court
the
single
most
important
power
it
must
have,
and
that
is
the
minimal
power
to
require
a
parent
to
bring
her
child
before
the
court
so
that
the
court
can
satisfy
itself
that
the
child
is
safe
or
if
not
safe,
to
provide
protection.
and
that
is
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
it
is
the
power
of
the
court
to
command
the
parent
to
bring
her
child
into
court.
thank
you.
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
without
any
doubt,
the
interests
in
this
case
are
the
most
fundamental
and
important
interests
that
the
state
has
to
protect
and
that
we
as
a
people
have
to
protect,
and
none
of
the
arguments
advanced
today
or
in
the
brief
or
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
meet
either
half
of
this
case.
with
respect
to
the
testimonial
issue,
on
page
10
of
respondent's
brief
they
say
this
case
need
not
be
decided
on
the
narrow
ground
of
whether
the
effect
of
producing
the
child
is
testimonial.
were
that
proposition
to
be
accepted,
it
would
largely
reverse
a
vast
body
of
this
court's
decisions,
and
it
should
be
rejected.
if
it
is
not
testimonial,
she
has
no
fifth
amendment
privilege.
i
think
they've
largely
conceded
that
it's
not
testimonial.
the
order...
judgment
below
should
be
reversed
on
that
ground
alone.
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
well,
i
think
the
sequence,
your
honor...
really
the
one
followed
the
other
quite
quickly.
the
order--
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
--i'm
not
disputing
that.
the
order
to
produce
was
given
by
the
judge.
that
led
to
some
information
being
provided.
she
was
held
in
jail
overnight.
then
the
following
day
the
information
is
verified
as
false.
he
asks
her,
do
you
want
to
produce
the
child?
she
says,
no.
judge
mitchell
then
cites
her
in
contempt
and
the
contempt
order
is
entered.
so,
i--
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
--yes,
and
that
the...
the
order...
the
contempt
order
plainly
is
an
order
to
enforce
the
order
to
produce.
and
i
think
that
it
is...
it
is
incorrect
to
look
at
this
case
only
from
the
point
of
view
of
well,
that
specific
order
is
directed
at
one
person
as
to
whom
there
is
some
risk
of
incrimination.
the
fact
is
that
order
grows
out
of
a
plainly
neutral
state
regulatory
system
which
exists
for
an
entirely
legitimate,
non-prosecutorial
purpose,
namely,
child
protection,
and
no
answer
that
has
been
given
today
can
meet
the
problem
of
where
will
we
be
if
the
state
cannot
require
a
parent
to
produce
her
child
in
court.
the
idea
that
criminal--
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
--right.
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
i
would
not
concede
that
it's
prosecution,
your
honor.
mr.
ralph
s.
tyler,
iii
it
is...
it
is
enforcement,
and
it
is
enforcement
in
this
case,
as
it
is
really
in
any
civil
case.
i
mean,
the
judicial
arsenal
is
limited.
what's
at
stake
in
this
case
is
will
the
most
effective
remedy
that's
been
identified
in
literally
centuries
of
cases
be
taken
away
from
the
only
court
that
exists
in
our
system
to
protect
children.
thank
you.
