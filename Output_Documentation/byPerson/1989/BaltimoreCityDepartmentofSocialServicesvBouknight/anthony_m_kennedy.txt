physical
custody?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
custody...
she
has
not
conceded...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
perhaps
she
has...
that
she
now
has
physical
custody
of
the
child.
she
couldn't
while
she's
in
jail.
and
she
hasn't
conceded,
i
take
it,
that
she
had
physical
custody
of
the
child
the
day
before
she
went
before
the
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
may
be
an
argument
for
an
exception.
it
seems
to
me,
to
make
it
even
more
testimonial
significant.
let
me
ask
you
this.
would
you
have
any
objection
to
giving
use
immunity?
i
understand
use
immunity
is
available
under
maryland
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
wouldn't
use
immunity
suffice
for
your
concerns
and
the
concerns
of...
of
others
in
this
very
important
case?
if
you
say
it's
not
testimonial,
then
you
can
have
no
objection
to
use
immunity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that...
is
that
the
way
it
usually
works
or
does
the
social
welfare
worker
simply
have
the
authority
to
go
out
and
investigate
the
home
and
take
the
child?
i
take
it...
would
the
social
welfare
worker
need
some
kind
of
warrant
in
order
to
do
that
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--there's
a...
as
i
say,
it
would
be
an
exigent
circumstances
so
no
warrant
is
required?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
this
the
way
it
usually
happens?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
just
to
conclude
the
point,
you're
saying
that
there
are
scores,
hundreds,
many
cases
in
which
courts
today
routinely
issue
subpoenas
to
parents
requiring
the
parents
to
come
to
the
court
with
the
child?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
mean,
does
it
now
exercise
that
power
on
a
wide
scale?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
then
that
in
most
cases
the
only
testimonial
implications
of
producing
the
child
are
something
that's
known
already
through
independent
evidence
that
the
child
was
living
at
the
house
and
that
the
child
has
injuries.
that's...
that's
not
something
that's
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment.
the
testimonial
aspect
is,
in
this
case,
where
the
link
between
the
parent
and
the
child
could
provide
a
very
important
chain
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
counsel,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
as
i
understand
the
case,
although
there
is
a
possibility
of
a
homicide
here,
there
is
also
the
very
real
possibility
that
while
we
sit
here
this
morning
that
child
is
in
need
of
care.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and...
is
that
a
possibility,
a
significant
possibility
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on...
on
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--this
record
of
previous
demonstrated
serious
abuse,
let's
stipulate,
if
we
can,
that
it's
a
serious
possibility.
i
just
want
to
make
very
clear
that
your
answers
to
justice
scalia's
question
is
that
the
fifth
amendment
overrides
any
interest
we
have
in
the
welfare
of
that
child
in
ordering
her
production.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
how
precisely
is
the
state
supposed
to
proceed
now?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that...
but
that
is
just...
still
avoids
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
and
my
concern
that
we're
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
child.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
you're
saying
that
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
done
for
the
welfare
of
the
child.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
ask
you,
while
we're
talking
about
prosecutors.
i
take
it...
or,
correct
me
if
you
disagree...
that
in
a
case
where
the
court
awards
custody
to
a
mother
but
with
a
warning
that
the
mother
is
to
cooperate
with
social
service
workers,
i
take
it
the
court
could
require
a
waiver
of
the
fifth
amendment
as
a
condition
to
remitting
the
child
to
the
custody
of
the--
