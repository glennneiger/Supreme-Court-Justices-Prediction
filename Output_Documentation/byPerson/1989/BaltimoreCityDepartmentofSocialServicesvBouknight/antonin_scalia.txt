justice

scalia
mr.
burns,
let's
talk
about
homicide.
suppose
you
have
a
very
nasty
divorce
and
the
husband
gets
custody
of
the
child
and
let's
assume
it's
conceded
that
the
husband
has
locked
the
child
in
a
cellar
with
three
days'
worth
of
food
and
everybody
knows
that.
and
the
mother
brings
the
husband
in
the
court
and
gets
the
court
to
demand
from
the
husband
where
the
child
is.
the
child
is
starving
to
death.
it's
two
and
a
half
days
now,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
court
cannot
compel
the
husband
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
not
going
to
have
an
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
say
you're
going
to
stay
in
jail
until
you
produce
the
child.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
worried
about
neglect.
i'm
worried
about
saving
the
child.
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
prosecuting
him
for
murder
if
the
child
dies.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
for
the
same
reason
that
we
don't
torture
people
after
they've
been
convicted
of
murder.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no.
to
say...
to
say
you
can
impose
imprisonment
for
a
coercive
purpose
that
does
not...
that
does
not
offend
the
fifth
amendment
because
it's
a
coercive
purpose
that
has
some
other
societal
end
than
convicting
the
individual
of
a
crime,
the
end
of
saving
the
life
of
the
child...
to
say
that
you
can't
use
torture
for
that
is...
is
no
more
extraordinary
than
saying
that
you
can't
use
torture
for
purposes
of
punishing
him
after
he's
been
convicted
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
crime.
but
it's
an
entirely
different
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
you
can
use
normal
means
of
punishment
to...
to
fulfill
an
important
societal
end
such
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
--saving
the
life
of
the
child.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
child
abuse
statute
in
existence.
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
then,
tough
luck,
kid,
you're
going
to
have
to
die,
huh?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
you're
begging
the
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me...
or,
i
could
think
of
another
hypothetical.
but
you
have
to
fall
back
on
the
position
that
if
there
is
no
other
way
to
prevent
the
social
harm,
even
if
it's
a
social
harm
as...
as
severe
as
the
death
of
an
individual...
if
there's
no
other
way
to
prevent
that
other
than
to
punish
the
person
who
doesn't
give
you
the
information
to
prevent
it,
that's
too
bad;
you
must
let
the
harm
occur.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they're
entirely...
they're
free
to
do
that
if
there
is
no
problem
in
doing
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
with
the
income
tax
cases
where...
where
you
have
to
go
in
and
say
what
your
gambling
earnings
were?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
woman
has
a
duty
to
produce
the
child.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
way
to
save
the
kid
who
is
dying
with
two
and
a
half
days
food
is
to
say,
okay,
you
tell
us
where
he
is,
and
if
he's
dead,
you
can
walk
free.
that
seems
rather
an
extreme...
an
extreme
price
for
the
state--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
burns,
the
rule
that
you're
urging
upon
us
is
full
of
these
difficulties.
for
example,
you
say
that
it's
no
good
in
this
case
because
you
could
have
done
it
a
different
way.
there
is
this
other
statute
that
you
say
is
after
all
a
big
deal
statute
which
requires
a
three-year
term.
now,
what
if...
what
if
the
child
is
so
badly
injured
that
the
incrimination
she's
worried
about
will
get
her
a
jail
term
much
more
than
three
years?
so
she
says,
it
is
still
worth
it
for
me
to
serve
three
years.
are
we
supposed
to
weigh
in
each
case
whether
the
other
available
means
that
the
state
has
is
really
going
to
be
effective
enough
to
save
the
child's
life
or
to
achieve
whatever
other
the
state
is
legitimately
seeking?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
want
to
save
the
child.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
want
to...
i
want
to
save
the
child.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
saying,
well,
three
years...
a
three-year
term
ought
to
be
enough
to
coerce
her
into
producing
the
child.
and
i
say
maybe
not.
maybe
the
only
thing
that
will
coerce
her
into
producing
the
child
is
to
say
you
sit
there
until
you
produce
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
vice
versa.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
the
order
to
produce
is
the...
which
is
not
contested,
is
the
equivalent
of
the
income
tax
statute,
and
the
contempt
for
failure
to
obey
it
is
the
equivalent
of
the
prosecution
for
not
filing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
the
statute
required?
