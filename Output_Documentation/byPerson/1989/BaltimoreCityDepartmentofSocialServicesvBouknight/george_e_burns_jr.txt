mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
turning
to
issue
number
one
is...
there
is
no
question
about
where
legal
custody
is.
in
terms
of
physical
custody,
i
think
mr.
mirviss
answered
mr.
tyler's
contention
when
he
said,
and
i
quote,
"the
child's
whereabouts
have
been
unknown
for
the
last
18
months.
"
obviously,
we
know
who
has
legal
custody.
we
don't
know
physical
custody
after
that.
so
i
think
in
that
case
obviously
is...
producing
the
child
would
be
incriminating.
the
state
also--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--well,
if,
for
example,
the
child
is
injured,
if
the
child
were
unfortunately
dead,
then
admitting
that
you
had
custody
of
that
is
certainly
a
reasonable
conclusion
that
you're
responsible
for
the
injuries
or
the
death
of
the
child.
physical
custody
at
that
moment,
as
opposed
to
sometime
in
the
past
that
you
had
legal
custody
and
physical
custody.
obviously
there
could
have
been
intervening
circumstances
that
you
had
no
control
over
that
caused
this
condition
to
occur.
but
if
you
produce
the
child,
it's
difficult
to
see
how
you
can
draw
any
conclusion
except
that
you
have
now
current
physical--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i...
i'm
not
sure
i
follow,
justice
stevens.
what
i
think
i'm
saying
is
this,
if
i
say
i
produce
the
child
today,
there
is
some
injury...
if
i'm
the
defendant...
it
seems
to
me
that
doesn't
necessarily
prove...
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that
proves
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i'm
suggesting
it
is
incriminating...
is
that
i
have
the
child,
i
have
this
child
who's
injured
and
i'm
admitting
physical
custody
right
now.
i
mean,
i
think
it's,
for
example,
a
byword
of
police
offers...
is
whoever
you
find
next
to
the
body
there's
a
50
percent
chance
they're
the
person
that
did
it.
so,
while
it
wouldn't
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
certainly,
i
think
it
certainly
is
incriminating
and
certainly
could
be
used
by
the
state
if
they
had
other
evidence
for
prosecution.
well,
then,
any...
any
mother
who
is
given
custody
by
a
juvenile
court
and
ordered
to
appear
every
so
often
perhaps
or
for
reason,
can
always
defend
by
saying
i'm
not
going
to
produce
the
child
i
have
custody
of
because
it
might
incriminate
me.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that's
incorrect
for
two
reasons.
one,
obviously
in
many
cases
there
is
no
question...
in
this
case
it's
conceded
by
the
state
that
you
have
this
reasonable
possibility
of
incrimination
in
terms
of
the
ongoing
homicide
investigation.
obviously
if
that
doesn't
exist,
if
no
one
thinks
anything
happened
to
the
child,
there
is
going
to
be
no
problem.
second,
i--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
think
that's
to
some
extent,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
i
think
the
court
can
say,
is
this
reasonable?
is
there
something
to
suggest
that,
the
mere
fact
that
someone
says
it.
but
i
think
the
second
part
may
be
more
important.
it's
been
contended
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
mothers
don't
have
to
comply
with
orders.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
say
that.
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
way
to
proceed
is
under
the
maryland
statute
3-831
which
is
a
neglect
statute,
which,
if
you're
under
order,
it
seems
to
me
and
it
seemed
to
the
court
of
appeals,
to
bring
the
child
in
to
comply
with
the
order,
you
have
violated
the
neglect
as
a
matter
of
law.
and--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--because
under...
no,
you
wouldn't
be
ordering
him
to
bring
it
under
that
statute,
your
honor,
you
would
be
prosecuting
him
for
the
failure
to
bring
it
in.
so
i
don't
think
there
is
a
privilege
there.
obviously
a
prosecutor,
any
prosecutor,
can
go
to
the
person
and
say
we're
going
to
prosecute
under
the
statute.
if
indeed
you
produce
the
child
in
good
health,
we
won't
prosecute
or
this
will
be
a
mitigation
factor.
so
there
is
no
question
that
the
state
still
has
the
power
in
this
case.
in
that
case
there
would
be
nothing
to
do
with
the
privilege
against
self-incrimination.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
it...
it...
it's
a
funny
statute.
it's
literally
criminal
but
it's
in
our
court's
article
3-831.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
key
difference...
as
a
practical
matter
i
have
to
agree
with
that,
justice
white.
but
i
think
the
key
difference
is
this.
under
the
3-831
there
are
two
possibilities
obviously.
if
the
child
is
unharmed,
that
acts
as
a
good
reason
for
the
mother
to
bring
her
in.
if
it
is
not
unharmed,
and
the
mother
isn't
going
to
comply,
it's
a
means
of
punishing
her
for
not
following
this
court
order.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
but
when
we're
talking
about
civil
contempt,
however,
we're
looking
at
two
problems.
not
just
putting
her
in
jail
for
that
order.
we're
also
looking
at
the
problem
of
we're
going
to
have
you
do
something
that
may
be
testimonial
for
some
future
prosecution,
another
unrelated
criminal
act--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--which
i
think
gives
the
distinction.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
no,
your...
no,
justice
white.
i
was
thinking,
for
example,
child
abuse,
assault,
or
even
unfortunately
homicide.
i
think
that's
the
distinction.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
justice--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
as
this
case
shows,
that
the
court
being
able
to
say
bring
it
in
three
days
and
these
cases,
if
they
are
determined,
is
not
going
to
have
any
effect,
if
indeed...
if
indeed
everything--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
with--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
same
thing.
you
can
say
under
3-831
there
may
be
a
duty.
obviously,
if
this
child
is
being
held
in
a
room
without
food
and
that's
what
you're
saying,
this
is
certainly
a
neglect
statute
and
you
can
be
held
in
jail.
but
i
think
the
other
problem
is
if
indeed...
and
that's
certainly
a
terrible
hypothetical...
but
if
indeed--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--that's
certainly
true,
justice
scalia.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
certainly
true,
justice
scalia.
but
if
indeed
we're
going
to
say
all
that
matters
is
that,
then
i
don't
see
why
the
obvious
solution
is
not
to
torture
the
person
to
get
the
information
because
that's
the
only
sure
way
we
have
in
this
three-day
time
limit.
as
the
morgan
case
shows,
there
are
people
that
are
willing
to
stay
a
lot
longer
than
three
days
in
jail.
so
if
the
only
thing
we're
going
to
focus
on
and
we're
going
to
ignore
all
constitutional
rights,
then
we
also
have
to
ignore
that.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
i
agree
we
shouldn't.
but
i
don't
see
how--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--and
i
agree.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
justice--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--sure,
justice--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--scalia.
but
i
think
the
problem,
the
underlying
premise
there
is
that
if
you
say
we're
holding
you
for
civil
contempt,
the
person
will
immediately
say
this
is
where
the
child
is.
if
we're
holding
you
under
3-831,
although
we're
holding
you
in
the
same
jail,
the
person
will
not
say.
i
think
the
problem
here
is...
is...
i
agree
with
your
hypothetical
if
there
were
a
real
need
for
it.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
you
mean
as
a
hypothetical,
i
assume.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
the
difficulty
there--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
i
think
there
the
question
is,
is
can
the
legislature
say,
well,
we
don't
like
the
fifth
amendment
very
much
so
we
won't
provide
any
statutes
to
protect
against
these
circumstances
and
get
rid
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--the
difficulty,
justice
scalia,
is
i
may
in
the
abstract
agree
with
that.
the
problem
i'm
pointing
out
is
here
in
the
real
world,
in
maryland,
that
problem
does
not
and
cannot
exist.
and
so
the
state
is
not
saying
that
this
is
the
situation.
the
state
is
simply
saying
we
don't
want
to
proceed
the
other
way.
we
have
to
do
it
because.
there's
no
reason.
if
you're--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--well,
i
think
then--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--well,
for
example,
justice
scalia,
certainly
you
have
a
duty.
you
have
a
duty
to
file
an
income
tax
return.
but
the
question
is--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--yes,
justice
scalia.
but
the
question
is,
can
the
state
say,
well,
we're
not
going
to
prosecute
burns
for
not
filing
his
income
tax
return.
we're
going
to
hold
him
civil
contempt
until
he
files
it
because
we're
very
interested
in
him
filing
an
income
tax
return.
so,
the
state's
using
the
option...
in
fact,
in
this
case
it
seems
to
me
if
the
state
can
use
that
option,
we
really
don't
have
much
need
of
criminal
laws.
for
example,
let's
suppose
we
know
someone
has
illegal
narcotics.
instead
of
going
to
the
trouble
of
prosecuting
them,
we
bring
them
in,
say,
you
come
in,
bring
us
the
narcotics,
or
you
stay
in
jail.
it's
a
much
simpler
procedure
and
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
things
like
proving
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--well,
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
problem
with
byers
is
that
we're
talking
about
a
statute.
we're
not
contending
any
statute
is
unconstitutional
in
this
case.
what
we're
contending...
in
byers
i
might
point
out...
and
in
page
14
of
our
brief
we
quote...
says
the
fifth
amendment
does
protect
what
may
be
incriminating
specific
inquiries.
so,
byers
isn't
saying
that
the
fifth
amendment
doesn't
apply
in
any
case.
they're
saying
in
a
general
statute
where
there's
nothing
on
its
face
that
looks
incriminating,
it
may
be
okay.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
byers
of
course...
in...
in
byers,
it
seems
to
me,
that
when
you...
if
you
look
at
the
statute
and
you
look
at
the
conduct,
there
may
be
by
chance
that
case.
but
when
we're
looking
at
thousands
of
motorists,
it's
hard
to
say
that
this
statute
is
aimed
at
any
motorist.
this
particular
order
is
aimed
at
precisely
one
person
who
the
state
at
the
same
time...
and
there's
been
something
made
of
this
distinction
between
the
state's
attorney
and
others...
but,
of
course,
the
attorney
general
is
part
of
the
state,
indeed,
represents
on
appeal
cases
from
the
state's
attorney.
so
i
don't
think
you
can
say
because
the
state's
attorney
is
involved
it's
easy
enough
to
contact
the
state's
attorney
and
get
them
involved.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
think
that
point
goes
to
this
whole
question
that
we
can't
do
anything
because
it's
a
civil
matter.
because
obviously
it
does
have
criminal
ramifications,
and
there
is
something
that
can
be
done.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
think
if
there
were
no
evidence
that
there's
some
risk,
yes--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
goes
to
that
there's
a
reasonable...
a
reasonable
opportunity--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
think
that's
true,
that
it
goes
to
reasons...
if
there
were
no
reasonable,
i
would
agree--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
marshall.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
think
the
police--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
think
the
police
are
more
sophisticated
than
that.
what
i
mean
by
that
is,
in
this
case...
and
we've
set
out...
is
you
have
the
records
of
the
social
workers
talking
to
the
police,
giving
their
opinions,
not
giving
their
opinions
for
any
reason
except
they
obviously
are
conducting
the
investigation.
you
have
an
extensive
homicide
investigation
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
a
far
different
thing,
the
mere
fact
that
i
may
ask
a
police
officer
to
drop
by
and
see
if
everything
is
okay.
well,
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
there's
any
real
risk
of...
of
prosecution.
in
this
case
i
think
the
state
has
throughout
quite
rightly
conceded
that
under
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
conclude
that
there
wasn't
a
risk
of
prosecution.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i...
i
agree,
justice
marshall,
and
i
think
that
was
one
of
my
earlier
case...
my
earlier
points.
in
many
of
these
cases
if
no
one
is
concerned
that
there
is
any
criminal
prosecution
possibility,
then
you
don't
have
the
problem.
but,
of
course,
the
other
thing
turns
around.
if
you're
not
concerned
with
that,
then
you're
not
concerned
either
with
use
immunity
because
the
simple
point
is
if
there
is
no...
if
the
state...
no
matter
what
the
defendant
may
say,
if
the
state
doesn't
believe
there
is
a
serious
risk
of
this
being
involved
in
criminal
prosecution,
you
simply
give
use
immunity
and
that
resolves
the
entire
problem.
so
i
think
our
point
is
that
this
doesn't
really
present
a
balancing
case
because
there
are
reasonable
alternatives
which
the
state
can
utilize
if--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--justice
scalia.
what
i'm
saying
is,
if
you
really
believe
that...
if
those
facts
are
known
to
the
state,
obviously
you
do
have
this
case.
what
i'm
saying,
in
a
case
where
the
state
is
going
to
argue...
and
that
was
my
answer
to
justice
marshall...
in
a
case
where
the
state
is
going
to
say
the
defendant
may
say
this...
there
is
a
concern
with
prosecution
but
we
know
better,
we
know
perfectly
well
the
child
is
in
great
health
with
another
family
member.
well,
the
state
can
call
that
bluff
very
easily.
all
i'm
saying
is,
in
a
case
where
the
state
is
not
concerned
with
that,
there
is
no
problem.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
suppose--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
think
it's...
i
can't
say
it's
not
a
possibility.
i
think
under
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
whether
it's
significant
is...
to
be
frank,
your
judgment
is
as
good
as
mine
under
these
facts
where
the
child
is--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--gone
for
18
months.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
i
think,
if
i
may,
give
two
answers
to
that.
first,
i
think
the
answer
would
be,
yes.
and,
of
course,
the
factual
problem
here
is,
although
you
have
this
history
of
abuse
of
the
mother,
we
know
for
a
fact
in
recent
times
the
mother
has
not
abused
anyone,
she's
been
in
jail.
but
the
second
point
is,
i
think,
justice
kennedy...
and
i
think
equally
important...
is...
is
the...
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
is
built
on
the
premise
that
the
state
can
do
nothing.
and
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
as
a
matter
of
law
found
that
to
be
contrary.
as
a
matter
of
maryland
law
the
state
can
do
something
without
forfeiting
any
right
under
3-831.
and
if
that's
true,
we
don't
have
a
true
balancing
case
because
all
we
have
is
the
state
saying
we're
going
to
resist
doing
it
this
way
for
whatever
reason.
i
don't
know
what
that
reason
is.
it's
not
a
matter
of
we
can't
do
it;
we
just
won't
do
it.
because
it
seems
to
me
the
court
of
appeals
is
in
maryland
law
the
final
decider
of
maryland
law.
they
concluded
this
was
the
applicable
statute.
and
as
i
said,
i
think
a
prosecutor
certainly--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--3-831
court's
article.
it's
cited...
it's
been
reproduced
in
6(a)
of
petitioner
maurice's
brief.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
state
simply
can
say,
we're
going
to
prosecute
you;
you...
we're
charging
under
this.
if
the
state
is
concerned
that
what
we
have--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--exactly,
judge
kennedy...
justice
kennedy.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i'm
not
saying
that
because
what
i'm
saying...
and
i'd
be
willing
to
say
that
i'm
sure
at
this
very
moment
there
is
somewhere
some
prosecutor
saying
to
a
defendant
that,
if
you
do
what
i
want...
in
this
case,
if
you
comply,
if
you
tell
me
where
the
child
is,
if
you
produce
it,
we'll
either
not
prosecute
you
under
this;
there's
going
to
be
a
mitigating
factor
under
this.
that
is,
all
the
things
that
basically
you
can
do
with
civil
contempt
you
can
do
with
3-831.
and
it
has
a
three-year
penalty
on
it.
so
we're
not
talking
about
some
minor
regulatory
thing.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
my
view,
justice
kennedy,
is,
assuming
all
the
proper
forms
going
through,
the
answer
would
be
yes.
there
wasn't
anything
in
this
case.
i
think
that's
certainly
another.
obviously
you
can't
use
it
in
retrospect,
but
certainly
in
future
cases
that's
a
perfectly
reasonable
explanation.
you
have
the
mother,
you
have
the
lawyer,
and
you
simply
make
it
clear
that
you
can't
use
the
fifth
amendment
for
this
limited
thing,
for
producing
the
baby.
so,
although
i
don't
know
of
a
case
where
that's
actually
happened,
i
haven't
seen
any,
i
see
in
principle
no
reason
why
it
isn't
a
perfectly
suitable
basis
for
avoiding
all
of
these
problems.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--justice
stevens--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--i
think
the
question
of
whether
it
would
be
proper
would
be
looked
in
a
particular
case.
if
you're
just
doing
it
as
a
matter
of
routine,
i
think
a
mother--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--but
the
problem...
i
don't
think...
i
may
have
misunderstood
your
hypothetical,
justice
stevens.
but
i
don't
think
there
was
any...
suggested
any
criminality
involved
or
anything
happening
to
the
child.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
think
only
if,
again,
there
is
a
reasonable
prospect
of
this
prosecution.
and,
again,
i
think
the
state
in
many
cases
is
going
to
be
sure,
despite
allegations
of
husband
and
wives
which
are
made...
that's
not
the
case.
and
you
do
have
the
example
saying
limited
immunity;
you
have
no
rights
whatsoever.
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
with
the
waiver,
i
think
it
might
be
a
problem
in
the
routine
case,
but
it
seems
to
me
in
any
case
where
you're
taking
what
i
would
call
a
high-risk
placement,
and
certainly
you
are
if
there
is
some
prior
history
of
abuse,
i
see
nothing
wrong
either
in
law
or
principle
with
saying
that
we're
going
to
condition
this
custody
which,
after
all,
is
some
risk
to
the
child,
on
a
waiver
of
exercising
your
fifth
amendment
privilege
in
these
circumstances.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
no,
i
don't
think
the
matter
of
waiver
would
be
any
good.
the
litigation
would
come
if
social
services
said,
we're
not
going
to
give
you
the
child
because
you
didn't
waive.
then
i
think
the
burden
would
be
on
the
parent
to
say,
well,
it
was
an
unreasonable
thing.
i
don't
think
that
goes
to
whether
the
waiver
is
good
or
not.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
it's
too
late
then.
i
think
if
she
wanted
to
litigate
it,
she
had
to
litigate
it
at
the
time
when
you
were
exacting--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--of
course,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
can't
be
responsible
for
what
courts
might
do.
however,
the
problem
here
to
some
extent,
i
think,
is
we're
working
in
a
vacuum
because,
as
i
pointed
out,
i
don't
know
of
any
specific
case
where
this
has
been
done
although...
i'm
not
saying
there
will
never
be
any
difficulties,
but
i
suspect
that
every
rule
of
law
there
is
provides--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--no,
justice
scalia,
because
i
think
what
you're
doing
there
is
you're
saying
that...
exactly
what
we
think
is
the
concern
here,
is
we
really
think
something's
happened
to
the
child
and
we
want
to
prosecute.
now,
obviously,
if
you
want
to
do
that--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--then
you
have
to
collect
evidence.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
well,
then
i'd--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--well,
of
course...
well,
it
hasn't
come
up
in
this
case,
i
think...
and
i
don't
think
this
court
has
actually
ruled
on
it...
is
there
are
limitations,
i
think,
on
whether
civil
contempt
can
be,
for
example,
turned
into
a
life
sentence
because
then
it
no
longer
has
the
purpose
of
coercing
you
to
do
this,
but
it's
becoming
essentially
punitive.
to
my
knowledge,
there's
no
case
where
someone
has
been
held
even
three
years
under
civil
contempt.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
wouldn't--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--justice
white.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
because
i
think--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--justice
white,
you're
not
prosecuting
for
exercising
that
fifth
amendment
privilege.
you're
prosecuting
for
not
complying
with
the
order
which
requires
you
to
keep
the
child
from
being...
neglectful
to
submit
to
this
supervision.
it's
like
any
other
criminal
case.
a
defendant
certainly
can
come
forth
and
say
something,
but
he
doesn't
have
to,
and
the
fact
that
he
doesn't
say
anything
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
that's
true,
justice
white.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
no.
what
we're
saying...
we're
saying
is
she
that
she
has
no
right
not
to
comply
with
this
order
as
a
matter
of
criminal
law.
what
we're
saying
is
you
can't
use
the
civil
proceeding
contempt
to
force
her
to
incriminate
herself
for
some
other
crime.
the
3-831
prosecution--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--they're
not
penalizing
them
for
that,
justice
white.
all
our
suggestion
is...
totally
in
those
circumstances
is
you're
penalizing
them
not
for
exercising
any
right
and
you're
not
trying
to
necessarily
collect
evidence
for
some
other
crime.
all
you're
saying
is
this
was
a
valid
order--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--well,
justice
white,
lots
of
arguments
are
made,
but
i
think--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--in
any
event,
i
think
is...
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings,
at
least,
that
this
isn't
a
viable
means
of
prosecuting
and
accomplishing
precisely
the
same
factor.
rylander
was
cited
by
the
state.
rylander
concerned
a
prior
enforcement
proceeding,
a
subsequent
contempt
proceeding.
here
the
prior
proceeding
that
we
would
be
talking
about
is
when
the
child
is
given
to
the
mother.
it's
difficult
for
me
to
understand
what
it
is
she'd
be
contesting
or
talking
about
in
the
fifth
amendment
at
that
time.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
think
the
problem
with
the
byers
is,
again,
the
specific
order.
again,
we're
not
attacking
the
statute.
as
i
think
i've
suggested
many
times
here
today,
there
are
certainly
many
cases
where
the
content
would
be
perfectly
proper,
and
in
the
ordinary
course
of
events,
there
would
be
no
problem.
but
here
we
have
a
judge
acting
with
all
these
facts
before
him
knowing
precisely
that
we're
after
one
individual
and
knowing
at
the
same
time,
as
the
state
concedes,
that
there
is
a
real
significant
problem
with
the
threat
of
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
order
or
the...
the
order...
if
i
may
say
one
thing,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
72
and
74...
pages
74
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
the
judge
talks
about,
in
reference
to
one
of
your
earlier
questions...
that
he
requires
there
be
verification
of
whatever
the
petitioner
says.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
which...
i
don't--
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
--oh,
i'm
saying
the
contempt.
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
you.
yes.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
i
think
you
can...
i
don't
have
any
problems
with
that.
mr.
george
e.
burns,
jr.
no,
that's
purely
contempt.
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood.
but
i
did
want
to
refer
back
to
72
and
74(a)
in
reference
to
one
of
your
earlier
questions
to
the
other
side...
is
that
where
the
judge
makes
it
clear
not
only
do
i
want
someone
to
say
i
can't
do
it;
it
has
to
be
verified
and
i
have
to
accept
it.
so
the
judge
is
making
perfectly
clear
in
the
hypothetical
where
you
can't
produce
it...
just
saying
or
telling
your
lawyer
to
say,
"i
can't
produce
it",
is
simply
not
going
to
be
enough.
thank
you.
