mr.
tyler,
does...
would
the
act
of
production
of
the
child
be
a
testimonial
statement
of
some
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
cases
where
orders
have
been
entered
to
require
turning
over
some
kind
of
paper,
this
court
has
indicated
in
its
opinions
that
to
do
so
has
testimonial
aspects.
why
wouldn't
turning
over
the
child
have
some
testimonial
aspects
as
to
her
possession
or
control,
or
something
of
that
sort?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
that
strictly
speaking
true?
you
don't
know
where
the
child
is.
she
has
apparently
given
untrue
statements.
and
so
it
isn't
known.
and
i
assume
the
state
would
want
to
use
the
testimonial
aspects
if
it
were
ever
to
file
criminal
proceedings
against
her.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
there
may
not
be
any
question
about
her
legal
custody.
but
the
fact
of
physical
possession
and
control
would
seem
to
me
to
be
testimonial
aspects
of
compliance
with
the
production.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
don't
understand
why
it
wouldn't
be.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
thought
she
did,
is
maryland
now
in
a
position
to
grant
limited
use
immunity
for
the
testimonial
aspects
of
the
compliance
with
the
production
order?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
state
could
make
it
a
laser-like
limited
immunity
so
that
just
the
testimonial
aspects
of
production
could
be
protected,
i
gather.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
is
that
so
if
limited
use
immunity
is
available
for
just
the
act
of
production?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
a
little
different,
isn't
it,
because
here
the
operation
of
the
contempt
order
is
particularly
individualized
and
based
on
specific
showings
that
also
lead
to
criminal
prosecution
probably.
and
so
it's
not
really
exactly
like
byers
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
much
more
individualized.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
in
byers
you
have
a
system
whereby
everybody
involved
in
an
accident
has
to
file
a
report.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
here
it's
only
the
person
whose
conduct
is
such
to
give
rise
to
concern
for
the
physical
safety
of
the
child
that
would
lead
to
the
imposition
of
a
contempt
order
that
would
give
rise
to
your
suggested
byers
exception.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
about
the
byers-type
exception
to
the
fifth
amendment
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
cases
come
to
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland.
they
concern
the
state’s
efforts
to
protect
the
petitioner,
maurice
m.,
a
young
child
with
a
sad
history
of
abuse
and
neglect,
by
seeking
to
have
the
respondent,
maurice’s
mother,
produce
the
child.
the
respondent,
entrusted
with
maurice’s
care
subject
to
the
conditions
of
a
court
order,
asserted
that
the
fifth
amendment
entitled
her
to
resist
the
production
order.
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
agreed.
in
the
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
respondent
may
not
invoke
the
fifth
amendment’s
privilege
against
self-incrimination
to
resist
producing
maurice.
the
state
demands
production
as
part
of
a
generally
applicable
regulatory
regime
constructed
to
affect
the
state’s
public
purposes
which
are
unrelated
to
criminal
law
enforcement.
the
respondent,
by
agreeing
to
care
for
the
child
pursuant
to
the
order’s
conditions,
has
accepted
the
corresponding
obligation
to
permit
the
state
access
to
the
child.
we
leave
open
the
possibility
that
the
fifth
amendment
may
limit
the
state’s
use
and
subsequent
criminal
proceedings,
if
any,
of
testimonial
aspects
of
any
act
of
production.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
is
reversed
and
the
cases
are
remanded
to
that
court
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
brennan
has
joined.
