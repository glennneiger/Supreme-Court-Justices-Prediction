justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
a
question?
you've
suggested
the
various
ways
in
which
compliance
with
the
order
would
be
possible
without
giving
incriminating
testimony.
but
you
haven't
considered...
and
i
don't
know
quite
what
the
answer
is...
the
possibility
that
the
child
may
not
be
alive.
and
if
that's
the
fact
and
that's
suggested
in
your
opponent's
brief,
that
there's
a
homicide
investigation
going
on
and
so
forth,
how
can
compliance
with
the
order
be
had
without
giving
incriminating
testimony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
incriminating?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
think
the
judge
would
take
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
is
obviously
unable
to
comply
while
she's
in
jail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
follow
that.
if
i
may
interrupt.
the
production
of
the
child
on
november
7th,
1989
admits
physical
custody
on
november
7th,
1989.
the
child
might
have
been
killed
or
injured
on
august
1st,
1989.
how
does
the
later
fact
necessarily
prove
the
former?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--oh,
but
wait
a
minute
on
that.
supposing
there
is
no
history
like
you
have
here,
which
is
fights
between
parents
and
so
a
mother
says
she's
entitled
to
custody
and
they
say,
well,
in
order
to
get
custody
you've
got
to
waive
your
fifth
amendment
privilege
and
she
says,
why
should
i
waive
my
fifth
amendment
privilege,
i
never
did
any--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
just
think
you
could
you
could
routinely
require
waivers
of
constitutional--
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
if
you
do
it
on
a
particular
case...
supposing
you've
got
a
case,
maybe
a
divorce
proceeding
that
seems
normal
as
it
starts
but
later
on
it
gets
acrimonious,
and
then
there
is
a
dispute
about
custody
and
somewhere
along
the
line
the
court
says,
i
think
the
mother
should
surrender
custody
by
such
and
such
a
date.
she
refuses
to
do
it.
he
orders
her,
bring
the
child
in,
and
she
refuses.
you
don't
know
the
details
of
it.
could
she
claim
the
fifth
amendment
privilege?
and
she
had
no
reason
to
waive
her
fifth
amendment
rights
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
when
she
comes
in,
she...
maybe
the
husband's
allegations
are
rather
extreme.
there
could
be
all
sorts
of
variations
in
the
facts.
but
does
she
have
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
just
like
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing,
mr.
burns.
is
your
attack
on
the
order
or
on
the
contempt?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that...
again,
are
you
saying
the
order
violated
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
order
holding
her
in
contempt
violated
the
fifth
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
order
to
produce
the
child.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you...
do
you
concede
the
order
to
produce
the
child
was
valid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tyler,
do
you
agree...
i
thought
the
question
presented
was
whether
the
order
directing
a
parent
to
produce
a
child
and
so
forth
violated
the
fifth
amendment.
and
he's
just
said
to
me
that
that
order
is
conceded
to
be
valid.
the
only
issue
is
the
contempt.
is
that
your
understanding
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
i
know,
but
they
are
legally
distinct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
agree
the
issue
is
the
validity
of
the
contempt
order,
not
the
order
to
produce.
