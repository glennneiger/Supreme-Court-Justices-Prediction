put
them
in

under
the
neglect

but
you
can't
put
them
in
jail
for

putting
her
in

justice

like
for
a--
justice

white
--like
for
a
neglect
prosecution.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
think
if
the
state
moved
to
this
other
procedure,
this
3-831,
or
whatever
it
is,
you
would
be
making
the

argument.
justice
byron

they
say,
well,
now,
we're
going
to
prosecute
you
for...
for
disobeying
this
order
to

you
can't
prosecute
me
for
exercising
my
fifth
amendment
privilege.

--well,
if
you're
right
in
this
case,
i
would
suggest
that
if
your
client
is
prosecuted
under
this
other
statute,
you
ought
to
think
twice
about
not
making
this
argument.
