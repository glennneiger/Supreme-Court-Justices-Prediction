chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-1182,
baltimore
city
department
of
social
services
v.
jacqueline
bouknight.
mr.
tyler,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tyler.
mr.
mirviss.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
byers...
i
mean,
mr.
mirviss,
are
you
going
to
address
the
california
v.
byers
aspect
of
the
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr,
mirviss.
mr.
burns.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
stop--
--in
what...
in
what
respect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
our
cases
say,
you
know,
that
the
court
can't
inquire
in
any
detail
once
the
claim
of
privilege
is
invoke.
that
it...
it...
it's
almost
up
to
the
witness
to--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--why
can't
you
raise
the
same
privilege
when
you're
ordered
to
bring
it
in
under
that
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
would
be
by
a
criminal
prosecution
rather
than
by
a
juvenile
proceeding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
ignores
the
context
here,
which
is
a
civil...
civil
proceeding
which
has
many
other
ends
in
view
than
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law,
which
is
what
byers
and
the
holmes
opinion
in
the
sullivan
case
are
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
may
be
okay
to
require
the
production
of
statements
by
someone
who
has
a
very
substantial
claim
that
those
statements
incriminate
him.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--maybe
you'd
also--
--if
you
can
require
that...
but
only
in
certain
circumstances.
i
take
it
you
say
you
can't
require
the
waiver
unless
there
is
some
previous
element
of
criminality.
then
it's
going
to
be
litigated
in
every
case
whether
the
waiver
was
any
good.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
mrs.
bouknight
here
had
waived
and
then
the
time
comes
for
her
to
bring
her
child
into
court
and
she
says,
no,
i'm
going
to
claim
my
fifth
amendment.
the
court
says,
well,
you
waived
it.
and
she
says,
well,
they
have
no
business
exacting
that
requirement
of
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
who
knows...
who
knows...
that
may
be
what
you
think
but
who
knows
what
courts
are
going
to
say?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
burns.
mr.
tyler,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tyler.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-1182,
baltimore
city
department
of
social
services
versus
bouknight
will
be
announced
by
justice
