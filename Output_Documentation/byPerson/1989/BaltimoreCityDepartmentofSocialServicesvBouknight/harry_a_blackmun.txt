harry
a.
blackmun
why
was
that
done?
this
is
another
"poor
joshua"
case,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
can
you
defend
that
action?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
do
we
need
hindsight?
wasn't
it
apparent
at
the
time?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
where
is
she
now?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
mirviss,
straighten
me
out
on
one
thing.
had
she
not
given
assurance
that
the
child
would
be
produced
to
the
court?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
counsel
gave
that
assurance?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
her
counsel?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
mirviss,
it
seems
to
me
the
record
is
silent
about
a
father.
is
there
a
father
in
this
picture
at
all?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
were
they
married?
not
that
it
makes
any
difference,
i
guess.
