mr.
robert
l.
tucker
good
afternoon,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
issue
that
we
bring
before
the
court
today
involves
the
issues
concerning
what
role
the
constitution
plays,
and
more
specifically,
the
fifth
amendment,
when
the
government,
in
a
criminal
case,
attempts
to
introduce
evidence
of
so-called
other
crimes
evidence
under
rule
404(b),
when,
in
fact,
the
defendant
has
previously
been
tried
for
that
very
conduct
and
found
not
guilty.
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
introduction
of
this
evidence
violates...
excuse
me...
the
defendant's
rights
under
both
the
double
jeopardy
and
due
process
clauses
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
in
this
particular
case,
no.
although
the
third
circuit
did,
alternatively,
hold,
on
that
basis,
that
issue
is
really
not
before
the
court,
in
our
view
of
the
case--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--well,
in
this
case,
if,
in
fact,
the
evidence
violates
the
defendant's
rights
under
the
constitution,
the
court
would
have
to
apply
a
different
harmless
error
standard.
i
suppose
that
the
court
could
decide
that
the
issue,
as
the
third
circuit--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--if
rule
404(b),
a
straight
404(b)
analysis
for...
forbids
the
evidence?
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
we
didn't
argue
it
in
our...
our
cert
petition,
and
the
reason
we
didn't
is
this.
if
rule
40...
if
the
evidence
is
inadmissible,
as
the
third
circuit
alternatively
held
under
a
straight
404(b)
analysis,
then
when
the
court
goes
to
the
harmless
error
standard,
it
would
apply
the
statutory
harmless
error
standard,
as
did
the
third
circuit.
now,
not...
we're
not
conceding
that
the
third
circuit
correctly
applied
that
standard,
but
we
do
concede
that
that
would
be
the
proper
standard
to
apply
if
it's
a
rule
404(b)
violation.
the
cert
petition
basically
raises
the
issue
that
the
third
circuit
applied
the
wrong
harmless
error
standard;
that,
in
fact,
they
were...
should
have
applied
the
standard
mandated
by
chapman
v.
california,
because,
indeed,
the
evidence
was
not
only
admiss...
inadmissible
pursuant
to
rule
404(b),
but
it
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
we
didn't
present
it
in
the
cert
petition.
let...
let
me...
let
me
put
it
this
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
now
that
the
court
has
the
entire
case,
it
would
certainly
have
the
power
to
review
that
and
decide
on
that
basis.
as
far
as
the
cert
petition
itself,
were...
were
we
merely
to
have
raised
that
issue
before
the
court,
what
we
simply
would
have
been
asking
the
court
to
do
was...
would
be
just
factually
review
a
harmless
error
determination.
i...
i
would
say
this,
it
is
our
position
that
the
evidence
is
inadmissible
to
a
straightforward
application
of
rule
404(b);
and
that,
in
fact,
the
third
circuit,
while
applying
the
right
standard,
nonetheless,
we
disagree
with
their
factual
conclusion
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
still
harmless
error.
but
if
this
court
were
to
hold
that
yes,
indeed,
the
evidence
is
inadmissible
under
rule
404(b),
and
yes,
indeed,
it's
harmless
error
under
the
statutory
standard,
then
the
court
would
still
have
to
go
to
the
constitutional
issue,
because
it
would
have
to
then
look
to
see
if
it's
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
and
was
it
indeed
harmless
error
under
that
standard.
so,
i
guess
in
answer
to
your
question,
if
the
court
decides
to
avoid
the
constitutional
issue
or
not
reach
the
constitutional
issue
by
merely
applying
rule
404(b)
analysis,
then
we
would
agree
you
don't
have
to
reach
it
if,
in
fact,
you
also
conclude
that
the
third
circuit
wrongfully
applied
the
harmless
error
standard.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
no.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
no,
it
was
certainly
not
offered
for
that
purpose;
it
was
offered
for
the
purpose
of--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--no,
i
don't
believe
it
was...
it
had
that
effect--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--well,
rule
404(b)
could...
it
was...
it
was
offered
for
the
purpose
of
proving
identity.
but
rule
404(b)
could
still
apply
if
indeed
the
evidence
was
not
relevant
to
that
purpose.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
well,
it...
it...
it...
it
is,
in
one
sense,
but
if,
in
fact...
it
wasn't
offered
strictly
to
that
purpose.
it...
clearly
we
admit
that
if
evidence
is
admissable
for
the
purpose
of
identity
under
rule
404(b),
that...
that
evidence
can
come
in,
assuming
that
other
standards
are
met.
but
the
third
circuit
held
that...
of
course
there's
numerous
cases
that
hold
in
order
to
be
admissible
for
identity,
there
are
certain
prerequisites
that
have
to
be
found.
for
instance,
either
that
it's
a
signature
crime...
in
other
words,
it
has
to
have
some
relevance,
in
fact,
to
identity
to
enable
the
jury
to
infer,
based
on
crime
a,
the
other
crimes
evidence,
that
crime
b,
the
one
being
tried--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--had
the
government
merely
limited
the
evidence
to
the
fact
that
vena
henry,
had
she
testified,
yes,
i've
seen
reuben
dowling
in
the
company
of
delroy
christian,
i
would
think
they
would
have
a
stronger
point.
but,
in
fact,
vena
henry
testified
that,
i
saw
him
in
the
company
of
delroy
christian;
he
was
in
my
house;
that
he
had
a
mask
and
he
had
a
gun.
also,
that
was
vena
henry's
testimony,
but
in
opening
statement,
the
government
had
also
informed
the
jury
that,
in
fact,
he
had
been
tried
for
robbery
in
connection
with
that.
and
the
trial
judge
twice
instructed
the
jury
that
he
had
been
found...
or
that
he
had
been
tried
for
robbery,
in
connection
with
the
vena
henry
incident.
so
the
jury
was
clearly
made
aware
that
this
wasn't
just
a
situation
where
mr.
dowling
had
been
seen
in
the
company
of
miss...
of
delroy
christian
by
vena
henry
and
he
happened
to
have
a
mask
and
a
gun;
they
were
clearly
aware
of
what
the
circumstances
were
through
the
state...
through
the
proffers
made...
or
the
statements
made
by
the
government
in
opening
statement
and
through
the
trial
judge's
own
instructions.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
you're
raising
just
the
404(b)
analysis
as
to
whether
the
evidence
should
come
in
just
by
mere
application
of
that
rule.
the
third
circuit
held
that,
basically...
and...
and,
as
i
say,
as
an
alternative
ruling,
that
it
didn't
comply
with
rule
404(b)'s
relevance
provisions,
and
they
also
factored
in
the
acquittal
in
that
process
themselves.
we...
we
feel
like
the
basic
problem
was
not
so
much...
although
we
agree
with
the
third
circuit's
alternative
ruling,
but
the
basic
problem
was
the
fact
of
the
constitutional
problems
presented
by
the
fact
that
a
prior
jury
heard
vena
henry's
evidence
and
said
no,
not
guilty.
and
that
raises--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--it
goes
to
the
collateral
estoppel
issue--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--as
to
whether
or
not
the...
the
issue
of
identity
had
previously
been
determined
by
the--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--by
the
jury.
now,
we
suggest...
now,
admittedly
the
record
is
not
clear
in
that
regard,
because
we
don't
have
a
transcript
of
the
first
trial.
so,
we...
and
we
have
a
statement
of
the
trial
judge
that...
where
he
says
i...
i
don't
think
the
issue
of
identity
was
seriously
contested.
and
we...
we
have
some
other
indications
that
at
least
cast
some
doubt
as
to
what
the
basis
of
that
verdict
was.
and
i'd
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points
in
regard
to
that.
first,
as
to
who
really
bears
the
burden
on
this.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
government
should
bear
the
burden
of
convincing
this
court
that
the
issue
of
identity
had,
in
fact,
not
been
decided
in
the
first
trial.
now--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--well,
i...
i...
you
know,
very
candidly,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
admit,
i
think
that's
the
government's
strongest
argument,
that
there
was
a
different
burden
of
proof.
i
think
that
argument
suffers
from
several
flaws,
though.
clearly
the
acquittal,
when
viewed
in
a
very
technical
sense,
merely
signifies
that
there
was
a
reasonable
doubt,
while
the
standard
which
the
government
had
to
bear
to
admit
the
other
crime's
evidence
pursuant
to
the
huddleston
decision
would
be
a
preponderance.
and
clearly
this
court
in...
in
the
civil
forfeiture
and
penalty
cases,
which
it
has
decided
following
acquittals,
where
it
has
basically
said
that
the
mere
fact
of
an
acquittal
does
not
bar
a
subsequent
civil
forfeiture
proceeding,
has
alluded
to
the
burden
of
proof
being
different
in
the
two
proceedings.
but
i
suggest
that
there...
the
burden
of
proof
argument
has
several
problems.
for...
as
far
as
the
forfeiture
cases,
we
would
submit
that
we're
really
talking
about
a
very
different
interest
involved
here.
of
course,
we're
talking
about
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
here
where
the
court,
on
numerous
occasions,
in
its
course,
has
recognized
that
a
defendant's
interest
in
a
criminal
case
is
much
stronger
than
the
defendant's
interest
in
a
civil
case.
the...
also
the
language
of
ashe
v.
swenson,
itself,
the
court,
in
more
or
less
rejecting
a
burden
of
proof
argument,
quoted
from
united
states
v.
kramer
as
a
rule
of
federal
law,
it's
much
too
late
to
suggest
that
this
principle,
referring
to
collateral
estoppel,
is
not
fully
applicable
to
a
former
judgement
in
a
criminal
case,
either
because
of
the
lack
of
mutuality
or
because
the
judgement
may
reflect
only
a
belief
that
the
government
is
not
meant
to
higher...
standard
approve
a
higher
burden
of
proof
exacted
in
such
a
case
for
the
government--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--that
is
true.
that
is
true.
and
the
court...
but
the...
the
court
utilized
this
language,
of
course,
the
burden
of
proof.
there's
no
question
that
it
was
the
same
burden
of
proof,
but
i
suggest
that
the...
this
language
indicates
that
ashe
did
not
turn
on
the
mere
fact
that
the
burden
of
proof
was
the...
was
the
same.
because
ashe
also
clearly
utilizes
other
language
that
we
see
in
many
of
these
cases,
that
the
defendant
should
not
be
required
to
run
the
gauntlet,
so
to
speak,
again,
and
he
clearly
has
to
run
the
gauntlet
again.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
i
don't...
i
think,
as
far
as
when
applying
it
in
the
civil
context,
that's
true.
the
restatement
of
judgement
alludes
to
that.
but
i
suggest
that
the
entrants...
interests
are
very
different
in...
when
applied
in
the
criminal
context,
especially
when
collateral
estoppel
is
considered
a
part
of
double
jeopardy.
in
this
court's
cases,
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
in
interpreting
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
have
never
really
been
very...
taken
a
real
technical
approach.
i...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
recall,
in
your
opinion
for
the
court
in
illinois
v.
somerville,
referring
to
the
fact
that...
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
not
interpreted,
i
think,
in
a
"mechanical,
rigid
manner".
that
follows
as
far
back
as
this
court...
court's
similar
decision
in
double
jeopardy
of
the
perez
case,
a
very...
justice
storey's
manifest
necessity
test
was
adopted,
but
a
very
technical
approach
would...
would
reach
a
different
result.
you
couldn't
even
be
retried,
even
though
you
had
obtained
a
reversal
of
your
conviction.
and
i
think
the...
looking
at
the
court's
double
jeopardy
cases,
we
see...
see
this
language...
or
these
results
all
through
the
line
of
cases,
where
the
court
basically
reached...
interprets
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
terms
of
what
its
purposes
really
are,
and
reach
a...
reaches
a
result
based
on
fairness.
the...
the
mistrial
at
the
defendant's
request
in
arizona
v.
washington,
the
court
recognized
that
really
that...
that
there
was
no
manifest
necessity
for
that,
but
nonetheless,
fairness
dictated
a
result
against
the
defendant
in
that
case
because
he...
he
had
initiated...
or
the
mistrial
had
been
as
a
result
of
his
own
conduct,
his
own
improper
opening
statement.
and
so
fairness,
in
interpreting
that
clause,
leads
to
a
different
result.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
well,
i
think,
clearly,
there
are
distinctions,
but
i
also
think
we
have
raised
the
due
process
issue
in
this
case,
too.
and,
at
times,
they...
they
tend
to
become
closely
allied,
i
guess.
but
i
think
the
arguments...
and
looking
at
the
cases...
and
i
want
to
emphasize
this,
because
the
burden
of
proof
argument,
i
think,
as
far
as
the
collateral
estoppel,
is,
of
course,
our
most
difficult
hurdle.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
sure.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
the...
yeah,
i...
i...
yes,
justice
stevens.
i
suggest
that
there
are
several
indications
in
the
record
that,
in
fact,
the
issue
of
identity
may
well
have
been
raised
in
the
prior
trial.
we...
we
had
the
indic...
and
i
assume
you
just
want
me
to
answer
based
on
what's
in
the
record.
i
am
in
possession
of
some
other
information
in
the
court's
files
as
to
the
resume
of
the
first
trial
and
the
witnesses
that
were
called,
and
that
sort
of
thing,
that
also
casts
doubt
on...
on
the
government's
assertion
of
the
issue
that
i--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--yes.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
i
think...
i
think
a
fair
answer
to
that
question
is,
indeed,
the
record
is
not
clear
either
way.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
that's
why
we
would
like
you
to
put
that
burden
on
the
government.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
the
issue
on
collateral
estoppel
would
be
who
had
the
burden.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
your
honor,
i...
i
would,
in
further
response
to
your
question,
i
agree...
i
think
i
agree
basically
that
since
there's
no
transcript
and
it's
not
clear
enough
either
way,
i
would
suggest
that
if...
if
the
court
extends
and...
and
agrees
with
us
that
the
principles
of
ashe
v.
swenson
apply,
and
collateral
estoppel
applies,
that
perhaps
a
remand
would
be
appropriate
for
that
determination.
but
there
are
some
other
indications
that
identity
was
the
issue.
for
instance,
the
defendant
testified
in
this
trial,
mr.
dowling
testified,
and
he
testified
he
did
not
rob
vena
henry.
now,
had
he
made
any
sort
of
admission
of
the
fact
that
he
had
been
in
vena
henry's
house
in
the
first
trial,
i
suggest
that
the
government
would
have
impeached
him
with
that.
and,
indeed,
had
his
counsel
made
any
sort
of
admission
to
that
effect,
he
could
have
been
impeached
by
that
also.
and
we
see
nothing...
that
he
was
not
challenged
on
that
basis.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
i
think
i
said
that
wrong.
he
said
he
was
not
in
vena--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--his
testimony
was
that
he
was
not
in
vena
henry's
house.
also
i
would
suggest
that
the
government...
the
theory
that
the
government
is
putting
forth
and
put
forth
at
the
trial
here
when
this
issue
arose,
that...
in
fact,
the
defense
was
that
perhaps
they
had
just
come
to
the
house
seeking
to
get
some
money
that
was
owed
them,
is
not...
would
not...
that
theory
violates
ashe's
language
that
this
court
should
look
at...
in
attempting
to...
or
to...
or
any
court,
in
attempting
to
reconstruct
the
basis
of
an
acquittal,
should
in
fact
not
apply
a
hypertechnical
rule
and
look...
and
look
at
it
with
reason
and
rationality.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney,
when
addressing
the
issue,
told
the
court
the
two
of
them
merely
came
to
retrieve,
from
an
individual
in
the
house,
money.
i
suggest--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--i
suggest
that...
that
the
government's
theory
that
the
jury
acquitted
on
the
basis
that
two
individuals
came
with
a
mask
and
a
gun
and
a
shot
was
fired
in
the
ceiling,
and
that
was
proffered
and...
by
the
government
lawyer
and
argued
in
the
admissability
of
the
evidence,
clearly
defies
ration
and
reason.
and
i
would
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
the...
the
defendant
was
not
only
acquitted
of
robbery,
he
was
acquitted
in
the
vena
henry
case
of
burglary;
he
was
acquitted
of
assault;
and
perhaps
most
importantly
of
all,
he
was
acquitted
of
weapons
violations,
where
he
was
charged
with
possession
of
a
weapon
during
a
commission
of
a
felony,
and
he
was
acquitted
of
the
lesser-included
offense
of
possession
of
a
firearm.
now,
had
the
jury
even
decided
on
this
basis
that
the
government
conjures
up
for
us,
they
still
would
have
had
to
have
found
he
possessed
the...
the
firearm.
and
they
acquitted
him
on
that
basis,
too.
so
i
suggest...
and
also
in
the
record
there
is...
in
the
volume
of
september
23rd
and
september
24th,
at
page
60
and
61,
there
is
evidence
to
the
effect,
when
the
united
states...
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
was
arguing
concerning
the
admissability
of
the
piece
of
evidence,
that
the
defendant
had
denied
his
involvement
in
the
vena
henry
case
when
he
had
first
been
arrested
in
connection
with
that,
and
that
denial
had
been
introduced
in
the
first
trial.
so,
when
you
couple
that
with
his
denial
in
this
trial,
the
lack
of
impeachment,
and
when
you
factor
in
the
ashe's
injunction
that
a
reviewing
court,
in
attempting
to
reconstruct
the
basis
of
the
verdict,
should
not
leave
its
common
sense
at
home,
that
i
suggest
to
you
that
perhaps
maybe
we
even
have
carried
the
burden.
and
if
we
haven't,
if
the
court
puts
that
burden
on
us,
then
we
would
suggest
a
remand.
if
i
could
just
address
one
other
matter
in
regard
to
the
burden.
the
lower
court...
ashe
doesn't
really
tell
us
who...
who
bears
the
burden,
but
the
lower
courts,
as
the
government
cites
in
their
brief,
pretty
much
assume
that
burden
should
be
on
the
party
opposing
the
admissability
of
the
evidence.
i
suggest
that
that
doctrine
perhaps
conflicts
with
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
too,
especially
the
line
of
cases,
and
i
believe
it
begins
with
the
fung
foo
case,
that
basically
say,
if
a
jury
finds
an
acquittal,
even
if
it's
on
a
total...
or
i
think
fung
foo
involved
a
judge
entering
a
judgement
of
acquittal...
on
a
totally
erroneous
basis,
and
the
reviewing
court
can
see
that
the
judge
should
not
have
entered
a
judgement
of
acquittal,
nonetheless,
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
now,
what
that
says
is
that
the
risk
of...
of
an
acquittal
on
a
improper
basis,
the
constitution
puts
that
risk
on
the
government.
and
i
suggest
that
a
continuation
of
that
principle
would
have
put
the
burden
the
government
here,
because
the
risk
of
a
reviewing
court
wrongfully
deciding
what
the
basis
of
that
acquittal
was,
should
rest
on
the
government.
the...
the
problems
that
we...
that
we
have
to
address
here
is
that
part...
the
protections
that
double
jeopardy
is
designed
for,
and
even
due
process,
and
that
this
court
has
always
showed
great
solicitude
for,
is
protecting
the
rights
of
innocent
people.
and--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--no,
i
mean
for
the...
for
the
rights
of
innocent
defendants.
[laughter]
the
problem
that
i...
that
i'm
trying
to...
trying
to...
perhaps
the
odds
are
on
our
side
on
this
one.
but
the--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--the
people--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--the
problem
that
we
get
into
here
is
that,
indeed,
a
not
guilty
verdict
on
this
technical
burden
of
proof
argument,
you
know,
the
government
can
say
that
all
that
means
is
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
somewhere
out
there,
you
know,
we
suggest
that
there
is
a
lot
of
people
out
there,
who
when
the
jury
finds
not
guilty,
they
mean
innocent.
they
might
not
say
that,
but
because
the
law...
that's
not
the
way
they're
instructed.
and
those
defendants
who
are...
who,
indeed,
were
innocent,
and...
and
this
court
has
always,
i
suggest...
suggest,
basically,
whether
it's
technically
correct
or
not,
has
treated...
not...
i
shouldn't
say
always...
that
may
not
be
correct,
but
certainly
the
court
has,
at
times,
indicated
that
a
not
guilty
verdict,
at
least
functionally,
the
system
really
requires
that
that
be
treated
as
innocence.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
in
the
civil...
i
clearly
have
to
draw
the
line
because
of
civil
versus
criminal.
i
think
there's
certainly
a
distinction.
but
the
language
that
i'm
recalling
to
mind
is
the
civil
war
case
of
ex
parte
garland,
which
was
cited,
i
think,
last
term
by
this
court
in
the
arkansas
case
of
lockhart
v.
nielson.
and
the
issue
there
was
what
the
effect
of
a
pardon
was
where
the
attorney
had...
i
think
there
had
been
a
oath
of
allegiance
to
the
union,
and
he
was
from
arkansas,
and
when
arkansas
seceded,
he
had
gone
with
arkansas,
and
then
he
wanted
to
come
back
before
this
court
and
practice,
and
congress
had
passed
an
act
saying
he
couldn't
practice,
i
believe,
unless
you
took
this
oath
that
you
had
never,
essentially,
been
against
the
union.
and
he
argued
that
he
had
indeed,
as
i
think
president
lincoln
had
given
him
a
pardon.
and
that
issue
came
before
the
court,
and
the
court
said
a
pardon
reaches
the
punishment
prescribed
for
the
offense
and
the
guilt
of
the
offender,
and
when
the
pardon
is
full,
it
releases
the
punishment
and
blocks
out
the
existence
of
guilt,
so
that
in
the
eye
of
the
law,
the
offender
is
as
innocent
as
if
he
had
never
committed
the
offense.
now
i
would
suggest
that
if
a
pardon
is
treated
in
that
manner,
where
a
jury
or...
and
that
wasn't
the
factual
situation
there,
but
if
a...
if
a
pardon
is
treated
as
innocence,
where
a
jury
has
returned
a
guilty
verdict,
clearly,
functionally
speaking,
where
a
jury
has
come
back
and
said
not
guilty,
that
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
go
too
far,
at
least
functionally,
to
treat
that
as
innocent,
at
least
in
the
context
of
not
having
to
be
retried
again
in
a
subsequent
criminal
case,
where
the
jury
asks...
is
asked
to
draw
an
inference
of
guilt
based
on
that
conduct
of
which
you
were
acquitted,
and
ask,
based
on
that
inference
of
guilt,
to
infer
that
you
are
guilty
of
the
instant
offense.
if
i
could,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
could
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
thank
you,
your
honor.
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
approach
advocated
by
the
government
here
in
its
argument,
and
indeed
in
its
brief,
really
trivializes
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
what
the
government
is
saying
to
the
court
is,
treat
the
acquittal
as
meaningless;
just
treat
this
as
whether
or
not
it's
relevant
evidence.
and,
in
fact,
the
government
even
tells
us,
don't
worry
about
the
defendant
because
he'll
have
an
opportunity
to
defend
again.
well,
that's
of
little
concern
to
a
criminal
defendant.
if
that
rationale
is
adopted,
then
why
can't
a
person
who
has
been
acquitted
be
retried
for
that
offense
again?
he'll
have
an
opportunity
to
defend
again.
the...
and
the
relevant--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--and
we
suggest
the
same
thing
applies
here.
the
same--
mr.
robert
l.
tucker
--we
would...
the
courts
that
have
applied
ashe
v.
swenson
to
this
situation
have
basically
said
that
there's
really
no
principle
of
distinction
between
ashe
v.
swenson
and
the
situation
presented
by
the
admissability
of
acquitted
conduct
evidence
in
a
subsequent
trial.
and
if
the
court...
we'd
ask
the
court
to
look
at
the
purposes
that
this
court
has
said
are
the
values
that
are
protected
by
double
jeopardy
protection,
and
those
same
concerns
are
very
much
present
here.
the
defendant
here
is
still
subject
to
the
same
strain
he
would
be
of
a
retrial,
the
expense,
the
ordeal
of
a
retrial;
in
fact,
his
situation
is
even
worse.
he
has
been
acquitted
of
crime
a;
he's
now
being
tried
of
crime
b;
the
government's
machinery
is
lined
up
against
him
to
convict
him
of
crime
b,
and
in
the
middle
of
crime
b,
he
has
to
defend
against
crime
a,
when
in
fact
he's
already
done
that.
clearly,
those
are
the
type
of
values
that
double
jeopardy
protects.
last
term
the
court,
in
rejecting
the
missouri
defendant's
claim
in,
i
think,
jones
v.
thomas,
about
he
should
be...
be
entitled
merely
to
have
his
15-year
sentence
because
the
two
consecutive
sentences
of
15
and
life
weren't
valid,
rejected
that
claim
and
pointed
out
that
one
of
the
reasons
we
reject
that
is
that
the
defendant
there
had
really...
he
didn't
really
have
any
legitimate
expectation
of
finality
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
that
15-year
sentence
if
the
two
consecutive
sentences
were
thrown
out.
here,
we
suggest
that,
indeed,
a
defendant
who
has
been
tried
and
acquitted
and
the
government
has
had
their
opportunity
to
present
their
case,
and
he
has
successfully
defended
against
that,
does
indeed
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
finality.
now,
also
the
concerns
that
the
court...
that
double
jeopardy
protects
against
repetitive
and
harassing
lawsuits
are
indeed
applicable
here.
for
instance,
suppose
a
defendant
who
has
been
acquitted
and
he...
and
he
is
suspected...
or
the
government
is
thinking
about
charging
him
in
what
otherwise
would
be
a
very
marginal
second
prosecution,
as
indeed
was
the
case
here,
this
was...
this
evidence
was
first
introduced
in
the
third
trial,
and
the
prosecutor
even
proffered
to
the
court,
we
need
this
evidence...
now,
what
this
means
is
that
a
defendant
is
subject
to
repetitive
lawsuits
based
on
the
fact
that
he
had
been
acquitted
because
of...
is
that
acquitted
conduct
evidence
that
may
indeed
be
the
piece
of
evidence
that
not
only
convicts
him
in
the
new
trial,
but,
in
fact,
motivates
the
government
to
press
forward
with
the
new
trial.
also,
we
have
the
concerns
that
are
equally
present
here
of
double
jeopardy
prevents
the
government
from
utilizing
the
first
trial
as
a
dry
run.
well,
we
have
those
same
sorts
of
concerns
here.
the
government
probably
learned
something
from
its
acquittal
in
the
vena
henry
case.
they
pare...
obviously
pared
down
their
evidence.
all
of
these
concerns
are
equally
present.
now,
the
government
cites
the
standefer
case
and
the
language
in
standefer
which
the
court
says,
well,
perhaps
we
should
take
a
cautious
approach
to
extending
collateral
estoppel
to
criminal
cases.
however,
standefer
is
entirely
distinguishable
based
on
these
very
same
concerns.
because
in
standefer,
the
defendant
was
claiming,
don't
prosecute
me
based
on
collateral
estoppel
on
an
aiding
and
abetting
theory
because
defendant
number
two
has
been
tried
as
the
principal
and
acquitted.
well,
it
follows
that
double
jeopardy
concerns
are
not
quite
as
strong
there
because
that
defendant
had
indeed
not
suffered
the
expense,
the
ordeal
of
the
first
trial
himself.
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
trial.
his
arguments
were
not
near
as
strong.
