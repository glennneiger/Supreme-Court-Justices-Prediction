justice
scalia
this
court
has
a
memory.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
that...
that...
that's
just
inconsistent
with
our
cases
that
say
that
it's
not...
you
know,
you're
not
precluded
from
bringing
a
civil
penalty
action
on
the
basis
of
a...
of
a...
of
a
criminal
acquittal.
we
are
just
not
willing
to
assume
that
an
acquittal
means
you
didn't
do
it.
