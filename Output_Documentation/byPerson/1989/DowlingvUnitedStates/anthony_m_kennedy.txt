justice
kennedy
well,
this
wasn't
test...
testimony
that
was
designed
to
prove
character--
justice
kennedy
--in
order
to
show
that
he
behaved
in
a
certain
way,
was
it?
justice
kennedy
and
i...
i
don't
think...
and
i
don't
think
we
could
construe
it
as
offered
for
that
purpose,
do
you?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
404(b)
doesn't
apply,
because
the
only
thing
it
prohibits
is
character
evidence.
justice
kennedy
there...
there
are
two
sentences
in
404(b);
the
first
prohibits
character
evidence.
and
as
we
agreed,
that
isn't
this.
justice
kennedy
well,
the...
the
purpose
for
my
making
the
comment
is...
and
it
bears
on
the
constitutional
argument
that
i
know
you're
trying
to
reach...
is
that
you
began
by
saying,
oh,
this
is
other
crimes.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
this
is
an
other
crime.
it
was
simply
the
fact
that
the
woman
had
seen
the
person
in
company
of...
with
christian,
and
that
therefore
he
knew
christian.
and
secondly,
that
she'd
seen
him
with
a
particular
mask.
it's
not
an
other
crime.
it's
not
a
crime
to
have
a
mask...
not
a
crime
to
be
in
the
company
of
christian.
it's
just
a
fact
that
is
highly
relevant
in
this
case.
justice
kennedy
well,
if
the
evidence
of
the...
the
gun,
the
mask
and
accompanying
christian
just
happens
to
be
in
the
occurrence
of
what
might
have
been
a
crime,
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
exclude
it,
unless
the
403
balancing
rule
comes
into
play,
of
prejudice
exceeding
the
probative
value
of
the
testimony.
but,
that's
not
the
argument
here.
justice
kennedy
but...
but...
but
that's
the
whole
point,
not
guilty
of
a
crime,
but
not
that
he
wasn't
not
with
christian,
not
that
he
didn't
have
a
mask,
not
that
he
didn't
have
a
gun.
this
point,
in
other
words,
goes
not
just
to
404(b),
but
it
also
goes
to
the
constitutional
point,
doesn't
it?
justice
kennedy
yeah.
justice
kennedy
right.
justice
kennedy
well...
well,
in
your
view,
is
this
just
the
misapplication
of
the
rule
of
ashe
v.
swenson,
or
is
there
some
new
proposition
presented
here?
justice
kennedy
suppose
in
ashe,
the
first
prosecution
is
for
robbery
in
the
house.
and
it's
very
clear
that
the
only
defense
is
identity
and
the
defendant
prevails.
justice
kennedy
identity
testimony
establishes
that
it
was
a...
that
it
was...
the
government
did
not
bear
the
burden
of
proof
that
this
person
was
in
the
house.
they
then
charge
him
with
murder.
does
ashe
v.
swenson
bar
the...
that
indictment
and
that
subsequent
prosecution?
justice
kennedy
that
he
was
in
the
house
and
committed
a
murder.
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
so
then
it
isn't
just
related
to
whether
or
not
the
same
offense
is
being
the
subject
of
a
subsequent
prosecution.
justice
kennedy
which
was
what
your
formulation
was.
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm
just
asking,
is
it
your
position
that
the
subsequent
prosecution
in
the
case
that
i
put
would
be
barred
by
ashe
v.
swenson?
