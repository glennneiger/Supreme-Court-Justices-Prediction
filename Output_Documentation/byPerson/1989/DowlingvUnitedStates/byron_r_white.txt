justice
white
yeah,
but
what
if
the
rules
forbid
this
kind
of
evidence?
justice
white
do
you
argue
that
or
not?
justice
white
i
see.
but
you
say
you're...
you're
not
presenting
here
and
you're
not
arguing
the
rule
404(b)
point.
justice
white
you
didn't...
you
won
the
case
below
it,
so
i
guess
you...
i
suppose
you
could
have
filed
a
cross
petition
or
something?
justice
white
but
you
want
us
to
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
on
its
constitutional
ruling?
justice
white
don't
you?
i
mean--
justice
white
--as
i
read
your
brief,
you
do?
justice
white
but
ashe...
ashe
suggests
that
maybe
the
acquittal
establishes
something
else...
it
can
establish
something
else.
justice
white
so
the
acquittal
does
do
more
than...
than
just
say
the
jury
failed
to
find
guilt
by...
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt;
it
also
may,
in
certain
circumstances,
show
why
the
jury
decided
that
way?
it
shows
that
the--
justice
white
--that...
that
the
jury
resolved
a
certain
fact.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
did
the
government
go
through
this
record
and
show
that...
that
what
you
wanted
to
offer
this
evidence
for
hadn't
been
determined
in
the
prior
trial?
justice
white
but
i
take
it
your
position
is
he
didn't
need
to
explain
at
all;
that
the
other
side
had
the
burden?
justice
white
i
see.
because
of
the
difference
in
the
burden?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
second
case
is
88-6025,
dowling
against
the
united
states.
and
here
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
that
has
been
filed,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
is
affirmed.
justice
brennan,
joined
by
justices
marshall
and
stevens
has
filled
a
dissenting
opinion.
