justice
stevens
may...
may
i
ask
you
a
question,
mr.
tucker--
justice
stevens
--about
the
collateral
estoppel?
when...
when
you
were
asked
before
about
whether
the
identity
issue
was
foreclosed
by
collateral
estoppel,
you
said
there
were
two
problems
with
that,
and
one
of
them
was
that
the
burden
should
be
on
the
government
to
show
that
the
issue
was
not
raised;
and
you
had
a
second
point
you
were
going
to
make
and
you
never
made
it.
do
you
know
what
it
was?
justice
stevens
but
there's
not
enough
in
the
record
is
there?
if
we
disagreed
with
you
on
burden
of
proof
and
thought
you
had
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
earlier
judgement
did
actually
decide
the
specific
matter
that
the
government
seeks
to
use
this
evidence
for,
would
you
not
agree
that
the...
the
record
does
not...
isn't
sufficient
to
say
you
carry
your
burden
on
that?
do
i
make
myself
clear?
justice
stevens
yeah.
maybe
there's
a
lot
of
stuff
out
there
that
if
you
had
a
retrial
you
could
do
that,
but
i
don't
think
in
the
present
state
of
the
record
we
can
really
tell
whether...
whether
the
jury
verdict
in
that
case
determined
that
your
client
was
not
the
person
who
went
to
that
woman's
house.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
so,
the
issue
really
is
who...
if...
if...
if...
if
you
don't
lose
on
the
difference
in
the
burden
of
proof,
the
issue
on
collateral
estoppel
would
be
who
had...
who
had
the
burden?
justice
stevens
the
government
says
you
should
because
you're
relying
on
it,
and
you
say
they
should
because
it's
unfair
to
do
it
otherwise.
justice
stevens
well,
i'm
not
sure
you
would
have
impeached
him
on
that.
if
he
just
testified
he
didn't
rob
her,
that
wouldn't
necessarily
be
inconsistent
with
the
fact
that
he
was
there
wearing
a
mask
and
carrying
a
gun.
justice
stevens
oh,
i'm
sorry.
okay.
justice
stevens
mr.
nightingale,
you
said
that
the
third
circuit
gave
too
much
effect
to
the
judgement
in
the
prior
case.
justice
stevens
well,
your
view,
i
think,
is
that
there
should
be
no
effect
given
to
it;
it's
not
a
matter
of
some
effect?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
so
their...
their
error
was
not
it
gave
you
too
much
effect,
it
wasn't
giving
any
effect?
justice
stevens
well,
it's
more
than
just
christian
and
dowling
and
the
white
vehicle.
it's
also
the
gun
and
the
mask.
justice
stevens
and
all
of
those
facts,
if
it
was
the
same
person,
it's...
it's
quite
probative
of
the
fact
that
the...
it
was
the
same
person
in
both
situations.
and
if
you
had
a
previous
trial
that
said
those
facts
existed,
but
was
a
different
person,
don't
you
think
there's
a
little...
something
a
little
unfair
about
this
man
having
gone
to
trial
on
that
issue
and
having
won
in
that
case,
and
saying,
well,
we're
going
to
use
that
same
evidence
all
over
again
to
try
and
prove
precisely
what
we
failed
to
prove
before?
and
i
understand
your
burden
of
proof
argument.
but
isn't
there
some
element
of
unfairness
in
that?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
no,
but
mr.
nightingale,
isn't
it
a
little
more
significant
than...
with
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
all
the
rest...
than
a
normal
collateral
estoppel
situation,
because
the
defendant
does
have
certain
benefits
out
of
an
acquittal.
he
can
get
an
immediate
appeal
if
he
later
claims
to
be
put
in
jeopardy.
because
there
is
an
interest
in
protecting
the
defendant
from
having
to
go
through
all
of
the
difficulty
of
defending
himself
again
against
the
same
charge.
and
that
is
somewhat
implicated
here
if
you
assume
that
the
other
evidence
really
opened
up
a
whole
new...
new
inquiry;
did
he
really
go
into
this
lady's
house
or
not?
and,
yes...
he
might
have
to
put
on
all
the
same
defendants
he
did
at
the
prior
trial,
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
so
isn't
there...
isn't
there
an
additional
burden
in
the
criminal
context
that
you
don't
always
find
in
the
normal
civil
collateral
estoppel
situation?
justice
stevens
well,
implicitly
they
were
asked
to
make
that
finding,
because
they
were
asked
to
determine
that
the
same
person
did
both...
both
robberies
or
both
crimes,
and
that
this
is
the
guy.
they
really
were
being
asked
to
say
this
is
the
man
who
robbed
mrs.
henry.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
limited
to
the
fact
that
he
was
in
her
house
with
a
mask
and
carrying
a
gun
and
wanted
to
get
some
money
that
he
thought
he
was
entitled
to.
it's
fairly
limited.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
it
bore
on
the
identity
of
the
bank
robber,
if
this
is
the
fellow
that
was
in
her
home
at
that
time.
justice
stevens
because
the
answer
to
that
is
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibit
it's...
prohibits
it.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
the
language
isn't
quite
the
same.
