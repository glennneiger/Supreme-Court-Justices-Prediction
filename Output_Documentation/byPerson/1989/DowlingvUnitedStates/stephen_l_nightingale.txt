mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
our
essential
position
is
that
the
reasoning
of
two
of
this
court's
decisions
require
the
conclusion
that
mrs.
henry's
testimony
was
admissible,
notwithstanding
the
prior
acquittal.
first,
in
huddleston
v.
united
states,
the
court
confirmed
what
the
rules
provide.
the
admissability
of
evidence
in
federal
cases
is
governed
by
a
standard
of
proof
that
is
effectively
the
same
one
that
a
trial
judge
employs
when
it
determines
whether
to
send
a
case
to
a
jury
in
a
civil
case.
evidence
is
admissable
if
the
facts
on
which
its
relevance
depends
are
supported
by
proof
sufficient
to
suppor
their
being
found
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
and
that
is
the
standard
that
applied
to
the
admissability
of
mrs.
henry's
testimony
in
this
case.
second,
in
united
states
v.
eighty-nine
firearms,
the
court
held
that
for
purposes
of
collateral
estoppel,
a
judgement
of
acquittal
in
a
criminal
case
establishes
only
the
existence
of
reasonable
doubt
on
whatever
issues
are
decisive.
such
a
judgement
does
not,
therefore,
foreclose
relitigation
of
those
issues
in
a
proceeding
in
which
they
are
subject
to
a
lower
standard
of
proof.
it
follows,
we
believe,
that
mr.
dowling's
acquittal
did
not
foreclose
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
from
making
the
finding
necessary
to
admit
her
testimony.
in
view
of
the
questions
that
came
up
about
the
applicability
of
the
rules
of
evidence
to
this
situation,
it
may
be
helpful
to
review
that
aspect
of
the
case
briefly.
first,
there
is
a
general
rule,
perhaps
the
most
important
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
which
is
that
all
relevant
evidence
is
presumptively
admissable.
that
rule
appears
to
reflect
the
assumption,
which
experience
suggests
is
well-founded,
that
the
best
guarantee
of
reliable
outcomes
in
any
trial
is
to
permit
both
parties
to
marshal
whatever
evidence
they
can
that
tends
to
make
the
facts
in
issue
more
or
less
likely,
and
to
offer
that
evidence
to
the
jury.
second,
under
the
rules,
judgements
are,
with
a
very
few
specified
exceptions,
hearsay,
completely
inadmissible
in
evidence.
those
exceptions
are...
are
inapplicable
here.
again,
the
assumption
appears
to
be
that
when
a
matter
that
has
been
the
subject
of
a
prior
judgement
is
an
issue
in
a
second
trial,
those
exceptions
are
inapplicable.
the
issue
is
to
be
resolved
by
allowing
the
trier
in
the
second
case
the
same
opportunity
to
see
all
of
the
evidence
that's
available,
as
was
available
to
the
trier
in
the
first
case.
each
jury
is
then
free
to
draw
its
own
conclusions
about
the
weight
and
probative
value
of
that
evidence,
depending
on
the
issues
in
dispute
and
the
other
evidence
that
is
available.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
yes,
your
honor.
and
our
position
is
that
when
one
reviews
their
rationale,
it
appears
that
they
accorded
the
judgement
the
same
effect,
in
terms
of
the
rules
of
evidence
that
they
had
concluded,
with
respect
to
collateral
estoppel.
i
forget
their
precise
language,
but,
in
effect,
it
was,
that
if
a
jury
has
determined
a
fact
in
a
prior
proceeding,
a
second
jury
should
not
be
allowed
to
find
that
fact
in
a
second
proceeding.
and
that,
in
effect,
is
collateral
estoppel
reframed,
in
terms
of
the
rules
of
evidence.
we
believe
that
there
was
a
mistake
made
in
all
of
the
court
of
appeals
holdings,
which
was
to
assign
too
much
effect
to
the
judgement.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
the
third
circuit
has
not
relied
on
ashe
v.
swenson.
the
third
circuit
has
limited
ashe
v.
swenson
to
the
situation
in
which
the
fact
is
essential
to
both
prosecutions.
it
has
concluded
that,
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law,
i
suppose,
the
collateral
estoppel
extends
in
addition
to
this
case.
so
that
we
believe
that
the
third
circuit
misapplied
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel,
and
that
it
would
be
unwarranted
a
fortiori
to
extend
to
ashe
v.
swenson
to
this
situation.
if
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel
does
not
reach
it
as
a
matter
of
common
law,
ashe
v.
swenson,
which
held
that
collateral
estoppel
was
embodied
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause
on
those
facts,
cannot
possibly
be
extended
to
this
case.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
yes.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
the
way
collateral
estoppel
and
the
rules
of
evidence
work
is
an
all-or-nothing
proposition.
if
the
conditions
for
an
estoppel
are
present,
it's
conclusive.
the
government
is
estopped
from
trying
to
introduce--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--any
evidence
inconsistent
with
a
prior
judgement.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
assuming
the
matter
of
what
was
resolved
by
the
prior
verdict
were...
were...
would
foreclose
a...
a
prior
prosecution,
that's
correct.
we
do
differ
with
the
petitioner
in
this
case
as
to
what
it
was
that
was
shown
in
the
trial
court
to
be
resolved
by
the
prior
verdict
of
acquittal.
it's
our
view
that
the
only
evidence
of
record
is
the
trial
court's
recollection
of
the
prior
proceeding
and
his
recollection
was
that
the
issue
of
mr.
dowling's
presence
in
the
house
was
not
seriously
contested.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
we
felt
that
was
unnecessary
when
the
case...
we
believe
that
we're
entitled
to
defend
the
judgement
of
the
court
below
on
any
ground
that
we've
preserved
to
this
point.
so
it
was
our
judgement
that
a
cross
petition
was
not
necessary
to
bring
before
the
court
the
question
whether
the
evidence
was
properly
admitted--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--we
believe
that
the--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--yes.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
yes,
we
disagree
with
the
third
circuit's
disposition
of
the
evidentiary
question,
both
as
a
matter
of
collateral
estoppel
and
under
the
rules
of
evidence.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
that's
correct.
that
is
the
effect
of
an
acquittal
in
a
criminal
case;
one
cannot
be
retried
for
the
same
offense
in
double
jeopardy
terms.
and
ashe
v.
swenson,
which
is,
in
effect,
a
subspecies
of
double
jeopardy
claims,
provides
that
it
is
deemed
the
same
offense
when
the
same
fact
is
essential
to
the...
to
convictions
and
subsequent
prosecutions.
it's
that
reason
that
we...
it's
that
understanding
of
ashe
that
leads
us
to
the
conclusion
that
the
case
cannot
fairly
be
extended
to
this
situation.
ashe
v.
swenson,
after
all,
is
a
decision
that
applies
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
that
constitutional
provision
prohibits
putting
a
defendant
twice
in
jeopardy
for
the
same
offense.
in
ashe,
because
the
same
fact
was
essential
to
both
convictions,
to
the...
to
both
offenses...
the
court
found
that
there
was,
in
effect,
the
same
effect...
the
same
offense
involved
in
both
cases.
and
that's
the
way
the
case
is
explained
by
justice
powell
in
his
footnote
6
in
brown
v.
ohio.
he
explains
ashe
v.
swenson
as
a
situation
in
which
there
is
a
particular
test
applicable
to
determine
whether
two
offenses
are
the
same
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy.
now
that's
a
characterization
that
can't
possibly
apply
to
this
case.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
yes.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
the
theory
of
the
prosecution
is
that
the
murder--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--in
the
course
of
the
robbery?
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
at
the
same
time?
yes,
then
ashe
v.
swenson
would
foreclose
the
murder
trial.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
to
reconcile--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--to
reconcile
ashe
v.
swenson
with
the
language
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
one
has
to
conclude
that
collateral
estoppel
establishes
a
subspecies
of
situations
in
which,
because
the
same
fact
is
essential
to
convictions,
it
can't
be
relitigated.
ashe
v.
swenson
can't
be
reconciled
with
the
language
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
in
one...
unless
one
believes
that
in
some
sense
the
same
offense
is
involved.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
yes.
now,
perhaps
it
would
be
helpful
to
walk
through
briefly
the
way
this
issue...
the
evidence
was
presented
in
the
district
court,
because
i
believe
it
illustrates
the
very
close
parallel
between
the
situation
that
faced
the
trial
court
in
this
case,
and
the
situation
that
faced
the
court
in
the
second
proceeding
in
eighty-nine
firearms.
the
theory
on
which
this
evidence
was
offered
in
this
case
was
that
it
tended
to
tie
together
a
line
of
circumstantial
proof.
the
inference
that
the
prosecutor
asked
the
jury
to
accept
was
that
mr.
dowling
had
borrowed
a
white
volkswagen
the
day
before
the
robbery
and
had
planned
to
make
his
escape
in
the
same
volkswagen
after
robbing
the
bank.
there
was
evidence
that
the...
there
was
a
white
volkswagen
in
the
vicinity
of
the
bank
at
near
the
time
of
the
bank
robbery.
and
one
of
the
individuals
in
the
car
was
identified.
he
was
mr.
christian.
now,
plainly,
if
the
prosecution
could
tie
mr.
christian
and
mr.
dowling
together,
it
would
tend
to
tie
together
that
line
of
circumstantial
proof.
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
offering
mrs.
henry's
testimony
to
show
that
some
two
weeks
after
the
bank
robbery,
mr.
christian
and
mr.
dowling
were
together,
under
circumstances
that
would
make
it
more
likely
that,
in
fact,
mr.
christian
was
waiting
for
mr.
dowling
and
was
to
assist
him
in
making
his
getaway.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
that's
true.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so,
because
the...
the
notion
of
fairness
that
you've
raised
relates
to
what
it
is
that
a
judgement
of
acquittal
establishes.
there's
a
circularity
here,
in
other
words.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
it's
unfair
only
if
one
assumes
that
a
judgement
of
acquittal
represents
a
finding
that
someone
else
did
it.
and
it's
our
position
that
that's
not
what
a
judgement
of
acquittal
establishes.
it
establishes
for
purposes
of
collateral
estoppel
that
the
jury
was
unable
to
find
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
crime.
the
defendant
gets
some
very
significant
benefits;
he
can't
be
tried
again
for
the
same
offense,
but
it's
not
as
though
the
history
of
the
events
was
wiped
away,
that
the...
there
is
not
a
seal
placed
on
the
evidence
that's
effective
in
all
future
cases
in
which
the
evidence
is
equally--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--i
believe
that
what
ashe
establishes
is
that
when
a
jury...
when
a
jury
acquits
on
the
basis
of
an
issue,
the
absence
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
an
issue,
the
government
cannot
seek
to
establish
the
same
issue
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
under
ashe
v.
swenson--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--under
ashe
v.
swenson,
the
court
is
required
to
put
itself
in
the
shoes
of
a
rational
jury--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--to
study
the
record,
the
instructions,
and
attempt
to
discover
what
a
rational
jury
must
have
determined.
but
in
eighty-nine
firearms,
the
court
made
clear
that
when
one
goes
through
that
exercise
and
concludes,
for
instance,
that
the
defendant
in
that
case
must
have
been
found
either
not
to
have
been
engaged
in
a
firearms
business
or
to
have
been
entrapped--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--your
honor,
the
government
rested
on
the
explanation
of
the
assistant,
who
was
a
second-hand
hearsay
explanation
of
what
he
understood
had
been
the
case
in
the
prior
trial,
but
there's
no--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--that's
correct.
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
even
if,
in
the
prior
proceeding,
it
could
be
shown
that
the
jury
had
entertained
a
reasonable
doubt
as
to
mr.
dowling's
presence
in
mrs.
henry's
house,
that
that
wouldn't
foreclose
the
evidence
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
the
difference
in
the
burdens
of
proof
and
the
fact
that
under
the
rules
of
evidence,
a
judgement
is
an
all-or-nothing
proposition;
it
either
forecloses
the
evidence
when
the
conditions
for
collateral
estoppel
are
present,
or
it
has
no
place
at
all
in
the
trial
if
it
doesn't
reach
that
level.
your
honor,
if
the
court...
please...
we
are
also...
in
terms
of
whether
it
makes
any
sense
to
extend
ashe,
i...
we
believe
that
the
reasoning
of
ashe
itself
limits
the
reach
of
the
case.
justice
stewart
indicated
that
he
saw
no
distinction
for
constitutional
terms
between
the
case
in
ashe
v.
swenson
in
a
case
in
which
mr.
ashe
had
been
tried
a
second
time
for
robbing
the
same
person.
and
therefore,
we
believe
that
under
the...
that
the
case
establishes
its
own
reach.
but
if
it
were
an
open
question
whether
to
extend
ashe,
there
also
have
been
some
developments
in
this
court's
cases,
which
we
believe
would...
would
urge
heavily
against
that
extension.
in
standefer
v.
united
states,
the
court
addressed
those
considerations
that
make
it
particularly...
that
call
for
particular
caution
in
extending
collateral
estoppel,
the
effect
of
a
judgement
in
the
criminal
context.
those
grounds
include
the
fact
that
in
a
criminal
case,
the
government
does
not
have
access
to
many
of
the
means
that
other
litigants
have
to
protect
themselves
against
irrational
verdicts
or
verdicts
involving
lenity.
the
record
in
this
case
suggests
that
this
might
be
that
kind
of
case,
a
situation
in
which
a
man
carrying
a
gun
and...
and
wearing
a
mask
was
acquitted,
and
the
trial
judge
thought
that
his
presence
in
the
house
had
not
been
seriously
contested.
but
the
government
had
no
opportunity
in
that
earlier
trial
to
make
a
motion
for
a
directed
verdict,
to
file
a
post-trial
motion
for
a
new
trial
or
a
judgement
notwithstanding
the
verdict,
to
take
an
appeal.
and
under
the
black
letter
laws
of...
black
letter
rules
of
collateral
estoppel
that
apply
in
the
civil
context,
the
absence
of
those
procedures
would
be
a
sufficient
reason
for
denying
collateral
estoppel.
in
standefer,
the
court
relied
on
those
concerns
in
refusing
to
extend
the
doctrine
to
permit
offensive
collateral
estoppel
against
the
government.
and
we
think
those
concerns
are
just
as
forceful
a
reason
not
to
extend
ashe
v.
swenson.
in
addition,
it
should
be
noted
that
in
the
civil
context,
at
least,
collateral
estoppel
serves
primarily
the
function
of
judicial
economy.
the
notion
is
that
one
full
and
fair
opportunity
at
an
issue
is
enough.
the
courts
have
enough
to
do
without
rehearing
the
same
issue
over
and
over
again.
in
the
criminal
contest...
context,
we
submit...
and
this
is
what
the
court
found
in
standefer,
the
interests
are
a
little
bit
different.
the
primary
interest
is
in
seeing
that
each
charge
is
litigated
fully
and
fairly,
and
particularly
in
view
of
the
absence
of
remedies
to
protect
the
government
against
irrational
verdicts;
verdicts
based
on
lenity.
we
think
that
the
court
should
be
quite
cautious
in
extending
the
doctrine.
ashe
doesn't
require
it.
we
believe
it
has
its
own
limits.
but
even
if
it
were
an
open
question
it
would
not
be
a
good
idea,
given
the
standefer
decision
and
the
considerations
that
have
been
addressed
there.
i'd
like
to
address
briefly
the
due
process
argument,
which
is...
seems
a
bit
of
a
variation
on
the
collateral
estoppel
theme.
i
got
briefly
into
it
in
addressing
justice
stevens'
question.
the
basic
question
there
is
what
is
fair.
and
the...
and
the
notion
of
fairness
is
circular.
it
is
unfair
to
rely
on
a
judgement
of
acquittal
only
if
one
believes
that
a
judgement
of
acquittal
is
a...
a
judgement
that
has
more
effect
than
any
other
judgement
in
any
other
type
of
case.
a
judgement
of
acquittal
finally
resolves
the
charges
on...
on
which
the
defendant
has
been
tried.
it
precludes
a
second
trial
on
any
offenses
that
are
considered
the
same
under
the
court's
double
jeopardy
precedence.
but
it
is
not...
emphatically
not...
an
order
expunging
evidence,
declaring
that
what
witnesses
saw
did
not
occur.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
the...
the
burden
of
relitigating,
i
submit,
if
collateral
estoppel
permits
relitigation
in
a
civil
or
criminal
proceeding,
the
burden
is
essentially
the
same,
in
terms
of
trial
time
and
so
forth.
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is
at
risk
of
conviction
for
a
different
offense
means
that
he
may
have
a
greater
interest
in
it.
but
in
eighty-nine
firearms,
for
example,
the
defendant
in
that
case
was
effectively
required
to
relitigate
the
entire
state
of
affairs
that
led
to
his
acquittal,
and
then
the
forfeiture
of
the
firearms.
the
fact
that
the...
and
in
terms
of
assessing
the
importance
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant
is...
is
subject
to
possible
conviction,
it's
important
to
remember
that
he
is
subject
to
possible
conviction
for
a
different
offense
than
that
for
which
he
was
first
tried.
what
is...
he
is
exposed
to,
with
respect
to
the
first
offense,
is
nothing
that...
that
resembles
jeopardy
in
the
classic
sense.
the
defendant
is
not
subject
to
being
convicted.
mr.
dowling
was
in
no
way
subject
to
being
convicted
of
having
allegedly
robbed
mrs.
henry.
the
jury
was
not
asked
to
make
that
finding.
he
could
not
be
punished
for
that
offense.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
well,
they
were
being
asked
to
determine
how
credible
mrs.
henry's
testimony
and
what
probative
value
it
had
with
respect
to
the
identity
of
the
bank
robber.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
but,
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
there
wasn't
even
proof
of
a
crime
as
such.
the
trial
court
took
care
to
limit
this
testimony.
he
cautioned
the
prosecutor
not
to
ask
open-ended
questions,
and
the
testimony
came
in
in
a
very
condensed
form,
limited
to
those
features
of
the
event--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--your
honor,
compared
to
the
proffer--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--compared
to
the
proffer
that
the
government
made
in
arguing
the
admissability
of
the
evidence,
which
involved
proof
that
there
was
a
shot
expended,
i
believe
that
there
was
a
conscientious
effort
made
here
to
limit
the
testimony.
and
what
was
put
in
was
not
evidence
of
a
crime,
as
such--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--it
was
evidence
which
bore
on
the
identity
of
the
bank
robber.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
that's
true.
and...
and
that
is
exactly
the
judgement
that
the
district
court
was
asked
to...
to
make.
the
evidence
was
admissable
if
that
judge
could
find
that
the
jury
would
be
reasonable
in
concluding
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
that
was...
that
mr.
dowling
was
the
one
who
was
there.
and
in
that
context,
mrs.
henry's
testimony
was
its
own
foundation.
if
believed,
it
established,
by
a
preponderance,
what
was
necessary.
i
would
add
briefly
that
there
is...
there
are
means
available
to
protect
defendants
against
overzealous
use
of
prior
offenses.
they
are
the
same
ones
this
court
referred
to
in
the
huddleston
case.
as
the
trial
court
did
in
this
case,
the
jury
can
be
instructed
that
the
evidence
is
to
be
considered
only
for
a
limited
purpose.
in
this
case
the
judge,
during
his
final
instructions,
instructed
the
jury
to
the
effect
that
you
may
consider
this
for
the
purpose
of...
if
it
assists
you
in
determining
who
the
bank
robber
was.
and
if
it
does
not
assist
you,
you
can
disregard
it.
the
judge
can
limit
the
testimony
to
that
element
of
the
testimony
that's
relevant
to
the
offense
for
which
the
defendant
is
then
being
charged.
again,
that
is
something
the
trial
judge
did
in
this
case.
he
admonished
the
prosecutor
to
avoid
open-ended
questions
and
limited
the
testimony
quite
carefully.
the
judge
can
exclude
the
evidence
altogether
if
under
rule
403
the
balance
of
prejudice
and
probative
value
is
against
its
admission.
under
all
of
these
circumstances,
we
believe
that
there
are
ample
means
available
of
protecting
defendants
against
unfair
prejudice.
and
that
the...
the
principal
rule
of
criminal
trials
should
be
the
one
that
governs
the
case,
which
is
that
all
relevant
evidence
is
presumptively
admissable.
the
admission
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
did
not
constitute
a
second
round
of
jeopardy
for
a
single
offense;
it
did
not
violate
traditional
principles
of
collateral
estoppel;
it's
entirely
consistent,
we
believe,
with
the
court's
decisions
in
huddleston
and
eighty-nine
firearms.
accordingly,
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgement
of
the
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
