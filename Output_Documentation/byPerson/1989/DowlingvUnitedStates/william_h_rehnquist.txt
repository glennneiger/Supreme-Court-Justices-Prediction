chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
88-6025,
reuben
dowling
against
the
united
states.
mr.
tucker.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
not
making
any
rule,
then,
that
404(b)
doesn't
authorize
it
or
should
be
construed
not
to
authorize
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
the
court
ordinarily
doesn't
want
to
reach
constitutional
questions
if
there's
a
different...
if
it's
a
statutory
ground
in
which
to
decide
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
don't
you
have
to
show
us
that
the
burden
of
proof
at
that
trial
was
the
same
as
the
government
is
required
to
show...
get
something
admit...
admitted
under
the
rules
of
evidence?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but...
but
in...
in
ashe,
the
court
was
dealing
with...
with
two
successive
criminal
prosecutions,
where
the
burden
was
the
same.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but,
you
know
that's
language
that
was
used
by
the
court
in
explaining
an
amendment.
it's
not
the
amendment
itself.
and
what...
what
you're
dealing
with,
a
provision
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
and
you're...
you're
invoking
a
collateral
estoppel
doctrine.
and
i...
i
thought
that
traditionally
collateral
estoppel
was
not
applicable
where
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
second
proceeding
is
less
than
the
burden
of
proof
was
in
the
first
proceeding.
chief
justice
rehnquist
from
what
you
say,
it
scunds
as
thought
double
jeopardy
is
almost
subsumed
under
due
process;
kind
of
a
general
fairness
requirement.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
would
be
kind
of
odd
to
come
in
a
mask
and
a
gun,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we've
upheld
the
position
of
the
government
about
the
last
dozen
double
jeopardy
cases
we've
written.
so
i
don't
think
you
can
say
our
double
jeopardy
decisions
show
great
solicitude
for
the
criminal
defendant.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--could
say
about
a
roulette
wheel;
it
has
no
memory
and
no
conscience.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
surely,
mr.
tucker.
mr.
nightingale.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
would
agree,
i
take
it,
that
they
couldn't
retry
the
defendant
for
the
vena...
vena
whatever
it
was
case
again?
chief
justice
rehnquist
since
that
would
be
the
same
burden
of
proof?
chief
justice
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
mr....
mr.
nightingale,
a
kind
of
a
hypothetical.
supposing
that
there's
an
indictment
that
charges
on
or
about
january
1st,
1985,
at
8:00
a.m.,
at
1600
pennsylvania
avenue,
john
doe
committed
burglary.
and
he
is
tried
on
that
and
acquitted.
now,
he
could
not
again
be
tried
on
that
indictment,
could
he,
no
matter
what
identity
evidence
came
up
at
the
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nightingale.
mr.
tucker,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tucker.
the
case
is
submitted.
