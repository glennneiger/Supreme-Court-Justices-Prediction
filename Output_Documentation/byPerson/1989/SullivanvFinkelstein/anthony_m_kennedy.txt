justice
kennedy
and...
and
i
take
it
that...
that
answer
applies
to
the
circumstances
in
this
case,
so
that
if
we
accepted
your
argument
on
finality,
she
did
lose
in
this
case
because--
justice
kennedy
--she
was
confined
to
the
listed
impairments.
justice
kennedy
so
she
could
have
appealed
in
this
case.
justice
kennedy
well,
in...
in
your
view
was
the
hudson
remand
under
the
sixth
sentence
of
405(g)?
justice
kennedy
well,
what
about
the...
what
is
your
position
as
to
the
proper
characterization
of
the
remand
in
the
hudson
case?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
it
was
under
the
eighth...
eighth
sentence?
justice
kennedy
if
your
view
prevails,
mr.
shapiro,
and
in
some
other
case
the
government
does
not
appeal,
and
there
is
a
remand
and
the
claimant
then
comes
back,
are
you
barred?
justice
kennedy
if
we...
if
we
accept
your
interpretation
that
it's
controlled
simply
by
the
language
of
405(g),
the
eighth
sentence,
is
that
the
first
alternative
of
which
you
spoke?
justice
kennedy
so...
so
you
would
be
barred
if
we
accepted
that
rationale?
justice
kennedy
under
your
view
of
the
statute
under
the
sixth
sentence,
in
every
case
of
this
kind
the
secretary
would
come
back
and
file
a
transcript
with
the
district
court?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
you
said
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
sixth
sentence.
at
least
i
thought
that's
your
position?
justice
kennedy
and
that
in
this
case,
and
in
every
case
like
it,
even
of
the...
the
claimant
is
the
one
that
prevails,
the
secretary
goes
back
into
the
district
court
and
files
a
transcript?
justice
kennedy
but
that's
not
what
happens,
is
it?
justice
kennedy
well,
why
would
the
secretary
go
in
and
file
a
transcript
in
the
hundreds
of
cases
where
there's
a
redetermination
of
benefits
and
he
orders
the
benefits?
justice
kennedy
unless
it's
something
the
district
court
wants
to
review
further.
justice
kennedy
well,
this...
under
this
sentence
it
says
"shall",
so
i
assume
it's
every
case.
justice
kennedy
well,
that
was
because
in
the
hudson
case
there
were
further...
the
court
retained
jurisdiction.
