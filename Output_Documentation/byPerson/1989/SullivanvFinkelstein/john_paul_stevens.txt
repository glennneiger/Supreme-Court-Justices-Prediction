justice
stevens
--may...
may
i
interrupt
you
before
you
go
into
your
legal
argument?
do
i
correctly
understand
that
under
the
direction
of
the
district
court,
the
administrative
law
judge
could
have
made
the
findings
that
were
demand...
ordered
by
the
district
court
and
nevertheless
said
that
the...
that
under
the
secretary's
rule,
the
failure
to
meet
the...
one
of
the
listing
requirements
makes
me
deny
relief,
and
therefore,
made
the
findings
and
still
ruled
against
the
claimant?
justice
stevens
well
what
is
there
in
the
district
court's
opinion
would
have
precluded
that?
justice
stevens
well--
justice
stevens
--well,
it's
clear...
it's
clear,
under
that
reasoning,
the
district
court
would
have
reversed
the
alj
if
that
had
been
found.
but
then,
why
couldn't
you
have
then
gone
ahead
and
reviewed?
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
mandate
or
the
order
of
the
district
court
that
would
have
foreclosed
the...
the
secretary
from
following
that
course
of
action
and
thus
preserving
his
right
to
review.
justice
stevens
well,
he
didn't
enter
an
order
saying
you
must
grant
review
if
you
make
the
appropriate
findings...
grant
relief
if
you--
justice
stevens
and
make
findings.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
correct.
and
then
on
a--
justice
stevens
--fuller
record
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
able
to
assess
the...
the--
justice
stevens
--the...
the
debate
over
whether
the
listings
are
an
adequate
response
to
the
statutory
requirements.
justice
stevens
well,
it
would
have
answered
this
question,
that
the
secretary
in
some
of
these
cases
argues
that
there
is
no
possibility
of
total
functional...
i
don't
have
the
right
phrases
in
my...
no
possibility
if
you
don't
meet
the
listing
requirement.
and
this
would...
you'd
have
a
specific
factual
determination.
but
whether
or
not
there
are
cases
that
the
listings
just
don't...
don't
account
for.
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
there
would
be
an
appeal
at
that
point
because
the
district--
justice
stevens
--the
district
court
would
then
say,
the
findings
having
been
made,
you
now
must
enter
judgment
allowing
the
claim.
justice
stevens
and
then...
then
there
would
be
an
appeal
directly
to
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
stevens
so,
the
first
case
in
which
the
findings
were
favorable
to
the
claimant,
would...
would
do
it.
there
may
never
be
such
a
case.
now,
your
basic
position
on
the
merits
is
those
cases
will
never
arise.
but
you're
never
going
to
let
the
facts
be
found--
justice
stevens
--to
determine
whether
they
will
rise.
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
that
argument.
but
the
mandate,
that...
that--
justice
stevens
--well,
it
will...
it
will
answer
the
question
whether
there
is
the
possibility
of
such
a
hypothetical
ever
really
existing.
because
the
secretary's
position
is
there
really
aren't
any
such
cases,
so
if
we
send
it
back
we're
going
to
win
on
the
facts
anyway.
that's
your
basic
legal
position
on
the
merits
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
but
your...
but
your
position
on
the
law
is
that,
well,
we
don't
have...
we
don't
have
to
put
that
to
a
factual
test.
justice
stevens
no,
merely
to
be
required
to
do
exactly
what
the
remand
ordered,
namely
make
some
findings
of
fact.
that's
the
only
thing
the
remand
order
really
required.
justice
stevens
it
doesn't
say
for
the
proceedings
consistent...
it
says
for
remands
for
further
proceedings.
he's
directed
to
make
this
particular
inquiry
and
these
findings.
that's
all
the
order
requires.
justice
stevens
mr.
shapiro--
justice
stevens
--which
is
your
legal
position?
justice
stevens
they
say
that
you
only
look
at
the
listing.
justice
stevens
that's
what...
all
the...
all
the
secretary
would
have
to
do
is
adhere
to
the
legal
position
that
he
maintains
on
the
merits.
justice
stevens
--that's
what,
you
know--
justice
stevens
yes,
but,
mr.
handal,
supposing,
as
your
opponent
argues,
that
the...
they
make
the
additional
findings
in
the
alj
decides
there's
total
functional
impairment
or
whatever
the
phrase...
the
lack
of
ability
to
engage
in
gainful
employment
and
so
forth...
and
gives
the
claimant
the
money
she's
finding,
can
the
government
then
get
review?
justice
stevens
on
what
authority
does
he
have
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
if
he
has
ruled
in
favor
of
the
claimant?
justice
stevens
but
supposing...
supposing
it
was
a
remand
under
four.
you
then
definitely
couldn't
go
back?
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
just
change
the
facts
very
slightly
and
see
what
your
answer
is.
supposing
the
district
judge...
and
i...
it's
a
little
ambiguous
to
me...
had
not
said
take
additional
evidence.
the
district
judge
simply
had
said,
make
a
factual
finding
on
this
particular
issue
that
i
regard
as
critical
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
already
in
the
record,
and
that
was
done.
would
the
secretary
then
have
power
to
review?
could
that...
the
sixth...
sixth
clearly
would
not
apply
then.
six
only
applies
when
you
take
more
evidence.
is
that
not
right?
justice
stevens
but
that's
exactly
my
question.
is
if
the
power
to
remand
is
exercised
without
supplementing
it
with
an
order
to
take
additional
evidence,
just
remand
and
make
a
finding
on
issue
x.
justice
stevens
and
after
you
make
the
finding,
enter
an
appropriate
judgment.
and
then
the
finding
is
made
and
the
judgment...
the
appropriate
judgment
is
the
claimant
shall...
shall
get
her
money.
justice
stevens
why?
justice
stevens
why?
