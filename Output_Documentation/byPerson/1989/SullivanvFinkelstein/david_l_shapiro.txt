mr.
david
l.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
an
important
question
of
the
appealability
of
the
district
court
decisions.
it
is
a
question
of
importance
not
only
in
the
administration
of
the
social
security
act,
but
over
a
wide
range
of
administrative,
rule
making
and
adjudicatory
activity.
although
this
court
has
never
addressed
this
question
in
an
administrative
setting
before,
the
question
has
been
considered
in
that
setting
for
some
four
decades
by
every
court
of
appeals,
and
the
vast
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decisions
support
appealability
in
the
context
that
it
is
presented
in
this
case.
in
addition,
in
very
analogous
situations
this
court
has
addressed
the
question
of
appealability
in
the
exercise
of
its
own
jurisdiction.
and
in
those
contexts,
appealability
has
been
upheld
explicitly
in
the
review
of
state
court
decisions
under
section
1257
and
implicitly
in
the
review
of
court
of
appeals'
decisions
under
the
hobbs
administrative
review
act,
section
2350,
as
in
the
famous
vermont
yankee
decision.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
it
does,
your
honor,
with
the
exception
of
decisions
granting
or
denying
preliminary
injunctive
relief.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
respondent
argues
in
answer
to
our
argument
that
the
court
under
the
hobbs
administrative
review
act
not
only
has
jurisdiction
to
review
final
judgments
under
2350
but
also
has
general
jurisdiction
under
1254.
we
believe
that's
clearly
not
so
from
the
structure
and
language
of
2350.
2350
indeed
specifically
adds
to
this
court's
jurisdiction
the
ability
to
review
a
certified
question
under
1254.
we
do
not
believe
that
2350
contemplates
a
general
authority
to
this
court
to
review
a
judgment
of
a
court
of
appeals
before
or
after
judgment.
what
it
does
is
it
puts
this
court
in
a
relationship
to
the
court
of
appeals,
which
is
the
entry
court
of
the
federal
system
in
a
situation
that
is
very
analogous
to
the
ordinary
relationship
between
a
court
of
appeals
and
a
district
court.
indeed,
for
this
court
to
grant
certiorari
before
judgment
we
believe
would
be
an
exercise
of
original
jurisdiction
in
violation
of
article
3.
this
particular
case
that
arises
before
this
court
involves
a
claim
for
survivor's
disability
benefits
by
the
respondent.
when
that
claim
was
finally
denied
at
the
administrative
level,
the
respondent
sought
judiciary
review
in
a
federal
district
court.
the
federal
district
court
held
that
the
secretary
has
made
an
error
of
law
in
relying
solely
on
the
listing
of
the
impairments
in
the
secretary's
regulations.
the
district
court
then
decided
that
since
there
had
been
no
individualized
determination
of
respondent's
residual
functional
capacity
to
do
gainful
work,
the
matter
had
to
go
back
to
the
administrative
agency
for
further
proceedings.
at
that
point,
the
secretary
sought
review
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
after
rehearing
en
banc
had
been
denied
by
the
court
of
appeals
over
three
dissents,
the
case
was
brought
here
for
a
review.
the
sole
question
before
this
court
on
certiorari
is
the
appealability
of
the
district
court's
decision.
we
submit,
in
accordance
with
those
courts...
on
the
majority
of
those
courts
that
have
reviewed
on
the
problem
below,
that
this
decision
is
appealable,
and
we
believe
its
appealability
may
be
upheld
on
either
of
two
alternative
grounds.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
except
that--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--the
district
court,
i
believe,
squarely
held
that
the...
the
respondent's
individual
residual
functional
capacity
must
be
considered
in
order
to
determine
whether
she...
whether
or
not
she's
entitled
to
benefits.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
that
is,
the
district
court--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
think
that
the
district
court's
decision
at
order
was
sufficiently
clear,
that
it
might
be
argued,
although
we
don't
rest
on
that
branch
of...
of
the
finality
doctrine.
it
might
even
be
argued
that
such
a
disregard
of
the
district
court's
decision
agreement
could
be
a
contempt
of
the
district
court's
findings.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
he...
well,
he
directed
the--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--he
didn't
say
that.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--court
to
hold
further
proceedings--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes,
with
respect
to
the
residual--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--functional
capacity.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
mean,
i
do
think
it
would
perhaps
have
been
theoretically
possible,
although
it
might
have
subjected
the
agency
to...
or
the
administrative
law
judge
to
some
form
of
contempt.
it
would
have
involved,
i
take
it,
an
automatic
reversal
by
the
district
court--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--unless...
and
then
a
possibility
of
review.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
that's
true.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
but
the
record...
the
record--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--but
the
record
would
not
have
added
anything
to
the
underlying
question
of
whether
the
secretary
can,
under
his
own
policy
and
regulations,
stop
with
the
listings
of
the
agency
as
it--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--at
the
agency,
i
think
in
this
case,
as
agencies
i
think
do
in
all
cases,
they
regard
themselves,
and
i
think
quite
properly,
as
governed
by
the
terms
of
the
remand.
so
that
the
agency
never
has
contemplated
the
possibility.
to
my
mind,
an
agency
has
never
deliberately
undertaken
to
disregard
a
court's
remand
and
to
say,
well,
you
told
us
that
the
listing
of
impairments
is
not
enough,
but
we
still
think
it
is
so
we're
coming
out
the
same
way.
because,
after
all,
i
suppose
if
it
happens
a
second
time,
it
could
happen
a
third
time.
the
case
goes
back
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
says,
well,
perhaps
you
didn't
understand
me,
i
said
you
must
make
it--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--well,
but
he
would...
at
that
point,
i
take
it,
the--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--oh,
if
the
findings--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
indeed,
there
are--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--there
are
two
problems,
your
honor,
i
believe,
with
that
approach.
the
first
problem
is
that
administrative
agencies
do,
and
i
think
properly
do,
regard
themselves
as
bound
by
the
mandate--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--but
the...
but
the
second
point,
it
seems
to
me
is
that
that
whole
process
would
add
nothing
to
the
consideration
of--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes,
it
is.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
i...
our
position
is
that
it
really
is
an
inappropriate
relationship
between
an
administrative
agency
and
a
court
for
the
administrative
agency
in
effect
to
be
required
to
disregard
the
remand
in
order
to--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--but
it
was
clearly
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
of
the
court.
and
the
court
said
it
is
not
adequate
to
rely
on
the
listing
of
impairments.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
think
the
agency
has
properly
understood
that
it
was
proceedings
consistent
with
the
opinion
of
the
court.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
that's
a
distinct
possibility,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
that's
our
position.
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
that's
right,
your
honor.
that...
that
has
been
our
position
consistently.
and,
indeed,
that
is
not
a
position
that
the
third
circuit
questioned
at
all.
the
third
circuit
was
following
a
line
a
little
bit
like
that
of
justice
stevens,
although
not
quite.
i
think
the
third
circuit
said
that
what
might
happen
is
that
the
claimant
would
lose
on
remand
because
she
would
be
found
to
have
residual
functional
capacity.
she
might
then
go
to
court
and
win
and
at
that
point
the
secretary
could
appeal.
but
i
think
the
third
circuit
assumed,
as
we
have
argued,
that
if
the
case
goes
back
on
remand
and
findings
are
made
in
her
favor
with
respect
to
her
residual
functional
capacity,
then
the
secretary
is
not
in
a
position
to
return
to
court
for
judicial
review.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
and
the
thing
i
think...
excuse
me...
just...
justice
stevens,
your
question
assumes
that
the...
an
agency
would
have
to
regard
any
findings
with
respect
to
her
residual
functional
capacity
as
irrelevant
to
the
outcome.
in
order
to--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--it
is
our
legal
position.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
but
it
is
not
a
legal--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--we
believe
he
is
not
free
to
do
that
on
remand--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--until
and
unless--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--the
district
court's
decision--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--no,
your
honor.
we
believe
it's
clear
under
section
405(g)
that
only
the
claimant
who
is
denied
benefits
in
whole
or
in
part,
may
seek
review.
the
first
sentence
of
section
405(g)
says,
any
individual
after
any
final
decision
of
the
secretary,
and
so
on,
may
seek
judicial
review
of
the
action.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
authorizes
the
secretary
to
seek
review
from
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
claimant
and--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--your
honor,
on
one
branch
of
our
argument...
that
is,
on
one
theory
on
which
we
support
appealability...
the
claimant
would
not
have
been
able
to
appeal.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
with
respect
to
the
narrower
argument
we're
making
based
on
cohen
against
beneficial
loan,
the
claimant
could
not
appeal
because
there
is
no
doubt
that
down
the
line
an
adverse
decision
against
the
claimant
would
be--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--if
the
court
agrees
with
our
argument
that
this
is
a
final
judgment
in
the
fullest
sense
of
the
word
that
a
claimant...
a
claimant
can
appeal
from
an
adverse
decision
of
law
underlying
that
judgment.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
the
government,
as
we...
as
we
concede
in
brief,
has
not
always
taken
that
position,
your
honor.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
she
could
have
appealed
the
determination
that
she
was
unable
to
show
that
she
had
a
listed
impairment.
that
was
the
determination
that
was
adverse
to
her.
just
to
clarify,
justice
scalia,
if
i
may,
my
answer
to
your
question,
we
are
making
two
alternative
arguments.
under
one
of
them,
the
fullers'
argument
about
finality,
if
that
is
accepted,
we
believe
she
could
appeal
from
an
adverse
determination.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
your
honor,
we
believe
that
that
is
a
tenable
construction
of
the
statute,
but
one
which
we
believe
is
quite
strained
and
involves
a
very
forced
and,
we
think,
unnatural
reading
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
with
respect
to
sullivan
against
hudson,
your
honor,
which
is
relied
thereon
very
heavily
by
the
respondent,
we
believe
that
case
has
to
be
understood
as
a
case
which
is
quite
clearly
directed
to
the
problem
of
finality
under
the
equal
access
to
justice
act.
indeed,
in
sullivan
and
hudson
the
court
specifically
said
that
its
holding
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
a
civil
action
and
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
finality
was
addressed
to
eaja.
and,
indeed,
eaja
contains
its
own
definition
of
final
judgment.
eaja
says
a
final
judgment
is
a
judgment
that
is
not
subject
to
appeal.
the
concept
of
finality
under
eaja
is
intimately
tied
to
the
concept
of
who
is
a
prevailing
party.
and
this
court
that
has
held
that
for
eaja
purposes
a
claimant
is
not
a
prevailing
party
until
her
claim
has
been
fully
resolved.
so,
for
that
purpose
the
court
held
that
the
court...
the
district
court
does
retain
jurisdiction,
that
the
judgment
is
not
truly
final
until
the
case
has
come
to
an
end
after
remand.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
there
has
been
a
very
substantial
argument
between
the
parties
about
whether
either
this
case
or
the
hudson
case
involved
a
sixth
sentence
remand.
our
view
has
been
that
this
case
clearly
is
not
a
sixth
sentence
remand
case
whatever
the
remand
was--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--our
view
was
that
the
remand
in
the
hudson
was
not
a
sixth
sentence
remand
either.
but
our--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--the
remand?
well,
the
fourth
sentence
says
with
or
without
remand.
the
fourth
sentence
refers
to
the
possibility
of
a
remand.
but,
your
honor,
it
really
is
not
critical
to
our
position,
because,
in
the
first
place,
we
are
not
seeking
to
appeal
the
remand
order
as
such.
and,
in
the
second
place,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question
even
a
sixth
sentence
remand,
in
our
view,
is
not
appealable
by
the
secretary
if
the
remand
results
in
a
judgment
for
the
claimant,
because
the
seventh
sentence
of
405(g)
specifically
limits
review
to
the
review
that
could
be
given
to
an
original
determination.
and
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
secretary
has
no
authority
to
appeal
an
original
determination
in
favor
of
a
claimant.
so,
even
if
this...
even
if
this
case
involves
a
sixth
sentence
remand,
we
don't
believe
that
affects
the
ultimate
outcome
on
the
issue
of
finality.
and,
as
we
explained
in
our
reply
brief
and
in
our
original
brief,
we
don't
think
it's
a
sixth
sentence
remand
in
any
event
because
it
is
not
a
remand
either
at
the
instance
of
the
secretary
or
because
there
is
new
material
evidence.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
i
do.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
think
the
same
proceedings
would
follow.
indeed,
we
suggested
in
our
opening
brief
that
what
is
now
frequently
done
in
the
form
of
remand
was
historically
done
in
an
action
for
mandamus
or
injunction.
and
the
fact
that
the...
that
the
disposition
now
takes
the
form
of
a
remand
does
not,
in
our
view,
affect
the
finality
of
the
judgment.
historically,
it
seems
to
be
remand
finds
its
origins
in
the
kinds
of
actions
you're
describing,
actions
for
mandamus
or
actions
for
injunctive
relief,
that
clearly
come
to
an
end.
what's
the--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
your
honor.
and
our
position
is
that
this
case...
our
position
we
believe
is
buttressed
by
405(g).
but
it's
also
buttressed
by
the
history
of
judicial
review
of
administrative
actions
even
before
the
apa.
and
it's
buttressed
by
the
apa
itself.
we
would
be
here,
i
think,
making
exactly
the
same
argument
if
this
were
an
action
under
the
apa
and
if
405(g)
were
not
there.
we
think
405(g)
supports
our
position,
but
we
don't
believe
it's
essential
to
that
position.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
address
some
other
aspects
of
what
i
have
described
as
our
narrower
argument
for
appealability.
that
is,
the
argument
that
is
based
on
the
practical
considerations
of
finality
that
were
first
articulated
by
this
court
in
cohen
against
beneficial
loan
and
since
in
a
series
of
cases,
including
coopers
and
lybrand.
as
i
indicated
at
the
outset,
we
agree
with
the
vast
majority
of
the
courts
of
appeal--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
believe
that
it,
in
truth,
it's
quite
analogous.
that
is,
to
take
a
case,
for
example,
like
asarco,
which
was
decided
last
term,
or
like
mercantile
bank
against
lagdo,
which
was
decided
some
years
ago,
these
cases
involved
review
of
state
court
decisions
in
which
a
state
court
had
finally
adjudicated
some
federal
question.
and
then
the
state
supreme
court
had
remanded
it
to
the
lower
courts
for
further
proceedings.
it
was
possible,
of
course,
that
when
the
case
came
back
to
the
state
supreme
court,
it
might
reconsider
the
federal
question
it
had
passed
on
before.
but
the
state
supreme
court,
as
far
as
it
was
concerned,
had
disposed
of
that
federal
question.
and
so
this
court
in
these
cases...
lagdo
and
these
other
cases...
held
that
for
purposes
of
the
final
judgment
requirement
of
1257
the
underlying
purposes
of
finality
had
been
met.
our
argument
here
is
comparable
to
that
and,
indeed,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
cohen
doctrine
is
a
recognition
of
the
applicability
of
that
line
of
reasoning
in
the
context
of
court
of
appeals
review
of
district
court
decisions.
the
particular
requirements
of
the
cohen
doctrine
we
believe
are
all
met
here.
indeed,
we
don't
think
there
can
be
much
argument
about
some
of
them.
for
example,
we
think
it's
clear
that
the
district
court
was
not
in
its
own
mind
making
a
tentative
decision
about
the
error
of
law
that
the
secretary
had
committed.
the
decision
was,
in
the
judge's
mind,
a
conclusive
one.
with
respect
to
the
second
cohen
criterion,
respondent
vigorously
contests
our
argument
that
it
does
apply...
the
criterion
that
the
decision
in
whose
review
is
sought
be
separable
from
the
merits.
we
think
it
is
undoubtedly
true,
indeed,
as
it
was
true,
i
think,
in
some
other
context
like
mitchell
and
forsythe...
we
think
it
is
undoubtedly
true
that
the
error
of
law
that
we
believe
the
district
court
made
is
an
error
that
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
respondent's
claim
for
benefits.
but
the
rationale
of
that
separability
requirement
we
believe
is
fully
met
here.
as
we
understand
the
court's
discussion
of
that
requirement,
it
is
designed
to
prevent
courts
of
appeals
from
interfering
unduly
with
the
ongoing
process
of
trying
the
case.
the
trial
court
judge
has
a
special
role
to
fulfill,
and
premature
consideration
would
interfere
with
that
role.
moreover,
the
court
recognizes,
i
think,
that
where
the
question
is
not
separable
from
the
merits,
that
what
happens
in
the
later
stages
may
affect
the
view
of
the
question
for
which
review
is
now
sought.
we
believe
that
neither
of
those
factors
exists
here.
in
this
case,
the
case
is
no
longer
in
the
trial
court
at
all;
there
is
no
problem
of
interfering
with
the
trial
court's
ongoing
discretion;
and,
as
i
tried
to
indicate
an
answer
to
justice
stevens
earlier,
i
think
the
administrative
agency
properly
views
itself
as
bound
by
what
the
district
court
did.
so
that
nothing
that
happens
on
remand
can
affect
the
nature
of
the
question
on
which
review
is
sought.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
again,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
depends
on
which
branch
of
our
argument
is
accepted.
if
you
accept
our
narrower
approach
that
this
is
appealable
under
the
cohen
doctrine,
then
i
think
under
this
court's
decisions,
for
example,
corey
and
the
united
states,
the
government
would
have
the
option
of
reserving
the
point
for
later
appeal,
if
a
fortuitous
series
of
events
made
that
possible.
if
the
court
accepts
our
broader
argument
that
this
is
final
in
the
truest
sense...
the
sense
that
i
think
i
was
suggesting
in
response
to
justice
scalia...
then
i
believe
that
the
time
for
appeal
would
have
expired
and
the
only
question
would
be
whether
there
is
issue
preclusion
in
a
later
action.
and
i
suspect
that
there
very
well
might
be.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
number
the
405...
our
argument
based
on
405(g),
like
the
argument
based
on
general
principles
of
finality
on
the
administrative
procedure
act,
is
that
the
proceeding
for
judicial
review
has
terminated
in
the
fullest
sense,
that
the
judgment
is
truly
final.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
that's
right,
your
honor.
i'd
like,
if
i
may,
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
respondent,
we
submit,
is
grossly
overreading
the
hudson
decision
and
in
doing
so
is
making
an
argument
that
would
allow
the
eaja
tail
to
wag
a
very
large
dog,
is
doing
so
in
a
way
which
we
submit
is
flatly
inconsistent
with
the
language
in
section
405(g)
and
is
not
in
the
interest
of
claimants
at
all.
the
secretary's
position
is
that
if
a
decision
is
rendered
for
the
claimant
on
remand,
it
is
necessary
to
file
the
necessary...
the
papers
in
court
in
order
that
a
determination
of
fees
may
be
made
under
eaja.
the
secretary
believes
that
there
is
no
right
on
his
part
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
a
decision--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--under
405(g),
your
honor,
we
believe
that
only
in
those
cases
covered
by
sixth
sentence,
however,--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--not
under
405(g).
but
under
eaja
it
may
be
necessary
where
the
claimant
prevails
in
order--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes,
that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
no.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
no,
your
honor.
no.
we
think
that--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--well,
i
think
he's
wrong.
[laughter]
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
not
only
that,
but
i
think
the
position
he's
taking
is
not
in
the
interest
of
claimants
because
he
is
suggesting
a
much
broader
ability
of
the
secretary
to
obtain
review
of
a
decision
in
favor
of
the
claimant
than
the
secretary
believes
he
has
under
the
act.
moreover,
i
think
it
clearly
is
in
the
interest
of
claimants
to
allow
an
appeal
at
this
stage
because
if
the
court
of
appeals
agrees
with
the
district
court
and
upholds
the
district
court's
decision
that
will
establish
the
law
of
the
circuit.
and
the
secretary's
acquiescence
policy
will
then
be
that
either
the
secretary
will
seek
further
review
in
this
court
or
will
acquiesce
in
the
third
circuit's
decision
and
all
future
decisions
will
be
governed
by
that
holding.
thank
you.
