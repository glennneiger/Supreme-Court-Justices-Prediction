mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
your
honor,
i
want
to
make
one
thing
clear
here.
the
secretary's
original
theory
in
this
case
was
stated
in
his
petition
and
in
his
opening
brief.
he
asked
the
court
to
hold
that
a
remand
order
under
section
405(g)
was
appealable
as
a
final
decision.
in
his
reply
brief
and...
and
now
the
secretary
has...
has
stated
basically
a
new
theory
that
he
should
be
able
to
appeal
a
legal
issue
that
accompanies
a
remand
order
in
an
social
security
case
while
the
case
is
still
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
not
only
is
that
idea
of
appealing
a
legal
issue
pretty
much
unprecedented
in...
in
the
court's
finality
jurisprudence,
but,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
the
secretary
has
no
need
for
this
overall
and...
and
no
need
for
it
in
the
context
of
this
particular
case.
and
most
importantly,
mr.
shapiro
says
that
section
405(g)
is
not
necessary
to
his
case.
the
problem
with
that
is
that
what
is
being
proposed
to
be
done
here
under
section
405(g)
is
totally
contrary
to
the
statutory
scheme
that...
that
is
laid
out
there.
and...
and
this
court
last
term
in
sullivan
v.
hudson
dealt
quite
extensively
with
the
statutory
scheme
under
section
405(g).
and
i'll
get
to
that.
the...
the
secretary's
new
theory
about
appealing
a
legal
issue
here,
mr.
shapiro
said
that...
that
it
is--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--well,
not
so
much,
your
honor.
as
the
theory
is
set
out
in
the
reply
brief
and
i
believe
that
what
mr.
shapiro
is
suggesting
here
is
simply
that
he
can
peel
off
the
legal
issue
from
this
remand
order
and
separate
this
situation
out...
the
remand
order...
into
two
separate
proceedings
and
thereby
appeal
the
legal
issue
while
the
remand
proceedings
go
back
to
the...
to
the
agency.
he
says
that
very
clearly
at
page
19
of
his
reply
brief.
mr.
shapiro
added
that...
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decisions
support
the
government's
theory
here.
there
were...
the
courts
of
appeals
were
probably
evenly
split
over
the
old
theory
that
he
should
be
able
to
appeal
the
remand
order.
there
is
not
a
court
of
appeals'
decision
cited
by
the
secretary,
and
none
that
we
can
find,
that
supports
the
secretary's
new
theory
about
peeling
off
this
legal
issue
and...
and
appealing
just
the
legal
issue.
and
we
think
clearly
it's
contrary
to
this
court's
decisions,
and
we
particularly
note
chief
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
in
the
liberty
mutual
case
in
1976
which--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
your
honor,
that's
what...
what
happens
under
this
statute
and...
and...
and,
first
of
all,
a
reading
of
this
district
court's
opinion
here
clearly
indicates,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
that
the
district
court
sent
it
back
for
the
taking
of
additional
evidence.
and...
and
that's
what
the
statutory
scheme
is
here.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
under...
under
the
new...
yes,
to
go
back.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
i
don't
see
how...
oh,
if...
if
they--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--no,
your
honor,
the
court
here
simply
remanded
the
case.
they
didn't
reverse
anything.
they
sent
the
case
back
to
the
agency
for
a
redetermination
of
benefits.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
i'm
not
sure
that
would
have
been
a
final
judgment
either
unless
the
court
had
actually
entered
final
judgment.
the
point
is--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
but
what
the--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--but
what
the
secretary
is
claiming
here
is
that
there
are
somehow
two
separable
proceedings.
and
the
secretary
is
suggesting
that
the
district
court
in
this
case
actually
affirmed
the
secretary's
decision
on
whether
mrs.
finkelstein
was
entitled
to
benefits
under
the
listing
of
impairments.
and
then
he
is
suggesting
that
the
secretary...
that
the
district
court
made
another
ruling
on
the
legal
issue
and
that
that
legal
ruling
is...
is...
can
be
taken
up.
that's
just
not
what
happened.
there
was
only
one
remand
order
here
and...
and
it's
not
superfluous
in
the
sense
that
we
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
on
the
remand.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
your
honor,
there
are
many
ways.
and
that
is
the
importance
of...
of
section
405(g)
and
of
the
congressional
scheme
there.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
your
honor,
under
the
statute,
the
secretary
is
actually
required
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
and...
and
file
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings
on
remand...
after
the
remand
proceedings
before
the
secretary.
and
your
honor
recognized
that
in
the
hudson
opinion.
your
honor
recognized
that...
that
the
district
court
under
this
statute
retains
jurisdiction
and...
and
waits
for
the
secretary
to
come
back
and
advise
the
court
of
what
happened.
and...
and
this
gets
to
one
of
justice
white's
questions.
there's...
there's...
the
secretary
is
then
able
to
appeal
from
the
district
court's
decision
and
can
get
consideration
of...
of
the
issues
from
the
remand.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
presumably
the--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--after
the
remand
proceedings,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
yes,
your
honor,
and
there's
been
no
judgment
entered
so
far
in
this
case.
all
the
district
court
did
was
enter
an
order
of
remand,
and
that's
something
that
happens
quite
often
under
this
statute.
50
percent
of
all
cases
disposed
of
by
district
courts
under
this
statute
are
remands.
and...
and
last
year
there
were
5,000
remands
alone.
it
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
your
honor,
i
believe
i
said
there--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--your
honor,
i
believe
i
said
that
there
was
an
order
entered
here.
it
just
wasn't
a
final
order--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--or
a
judgment.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
clearly
there
was
an
order
entered
here,
and--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--and
that's
what
often
happens.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
and...
and
your
honor
raises
an
interesting
point
about
the...
the
claimant's
entitlement
to
benefits.
the
secretary
here
is
trying
to
make
this
case
into
some
test
of...
of
his
legal
theory.
that's
not
what
this
case
is
about.
it's
about
mrs.
finkelstein
trying
to
get
her
benefits.
and...
and...
the...
the...
according
to
the
long-standing
social
security
administration
policy,
this
district
court
opinion
has
no
further
reach
than
mrs.
finkelstein's
case.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
your
honor--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--your
honor,
first
of
all,
i'd
note
that
in
califano
v.
sanders,
this
court
held
that
there
is
very
limited
review
under...
under...
under
the
apa
for
social
security
cases.
the
statute
we're
dealing
here
is
a
very
different
animal,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
hudson.
it's
a
very,
quote,
unusual
statute
and
we're
not
looking
to
the
apa
here.
secondly,
as
provided
in
the
statute
in
this
case,
mrs.
finkelstein
went
to
the
district
court
seeking
review
of
her
denial
of
benefits,
and
that
is
specifically
provided
for
under
this
statute.
she
didn't
seek
declaratory
relief.
she
didn't
seek
injunctive
relief.
she
didn't
try
to
invalidate
any
regulations.
and
a
reading
of
the
district
court's
opinion
and
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
here
clearly
indicates
that
they
didn't
think
any
regulations
were
invalidated.
and
then
i
go
on
to
my
further
point
that
under
ssa's
policy
this
case
has
no
further
reach
than
mrs.
finkelstein's
benefits.
it's
not
going
to
be
applied
by
ssa
anywhere
else.
this...
this
is
a
very
peculiar
statute
and...
and...
it's...
it's
one
that
allows
the
district
court
to
retain
jurisdiction
of
the
case.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
i...
i--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--your
honor,
the
court
said
that
for
one
thing
in
the
hudson
case
that
is
was,
quote,
an
unusual
statute...
in
that
it
took
the
district
courts
out
of
their
ordinary
role
as,
quote,
administrative
overseers
and
made
them
ground
level
participants
in
the
administrative
process.
these
cases
go
back
and
forth
between
the
district
court
and
the
agency
all
the
time.
the...
the
statute
is...
is
unusual
in
that
in,
for
example,
in
the
fourth
sentence
it...
it
gave
the
court
the
power
to
modify
the
agency
decision.
the
district
court
here,
if
it
had
wanted
to,
could
simply
have
set
mrs.
finkelstein's
benefits
and...
and
then
remanded
the
case
for
payment
or
for
certification.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
your
honor,
we...
we
set
forth
in
our
brief
a
discussion
of
the
state
of
the
law
actually
in
1939
when
this
statute
was
passed.
and
the...
the
cases
cited
there
indicated
that
when
courts
reviewed
administrative
actions
they
were
pretty
much
limited
to
affirming
or
reversing
the
action,
not
to
get
really
involved
in
the
rate
making
or
the
setting
of
rates
or
whatever.
this
statute,
as
the
court
said
in
hudson
last
term,
allows
the
district
courts
to
really
get
involved
in
the--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--not
specifically,
your
honor.
no.
there
are
no
such
cases.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
yes,
your
honor,
that's
the
way
the
sixth
sentence
mechanism
works.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
that's
what
is
contemplated
by
the
sixth
sentence,
and--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--your
honor,
we
understand
it
does
happen
in...
in
a
lot
of
cases.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
your
honor,
in--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--your
honor,
the
parties
are
able
to
ask
for
further
review
at
that
point.
in
these
cases
what
actually
happens
is
the
district
court
judge
retains
the
case.
it's
the
same
docket
number.
and...
and
the
parties
often
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
the
secretary
does
file
the
transcript.
the
secretary
has
claimed
in
the
lower
courts--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--it...
it
certainly
does
seem
to
require
that,
your
honor.
and
that's
what
the
court...
this
court
said
in
the
hudson
case,
that
it
does
require
that.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
your
honor,
we
have
that
same
situation
here.
that
the...
automatically
under
this
statute
the
case
is
sent
back
to
the
agency
and
the
court
retains
jurisdiction.
the
secretary
has
agreed
in
this
case
that
the
sixth
sentence
does
say
it's
appropriate
for
him
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
after
the
proceedings
on
remand.
in
hudson
he
conceded
that
he...
that
the
district
court
retained
jurisdiction
and
that
he
was
required
to
do
that,
and
so
this
court
held.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
no,
your
honor.
the...
clearly
what
we're
most
concerned
with
here
is
the
second
part
of
the
sixth
sentence
which
describes
the
remand
mechanism
and,
as
the
court
said
in
hudson,
that
mechanism
applies
to
all
remands,
and
it
applied
to
the
remand
in
that
case.
the
first
part
of
the
sixth
sentence
clearly
where
it
says,
"and
it
may
at
anytime
order
additional
evidence
to
be
taken.
"
that
clearly
applies
to...
to
all
remands.
and
as
justice
stevens
said,
it
certainly
can
be
read
as
applying
to
this
remand
in
this
case,
according
to
the
district
court's
opinion.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
yes,
your
honor.
that's
what
the
first
part--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--that's
not
the
way
that's
been
interpreted,
your
honor.
it's
been
interpreted
to
mean
that
the
secretary...
that
the
district
court
may
at
any
time
order
additional
evidence.
and
that's
what
it
did
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
no,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
perhaps,
your
honor.
but
the
way
this
statute
has
been
interpreted,
the
second
clause
of
that
sentence
refers
to
at
any
time
ordering
additional
evidence
to
be
taken.
in
fact,
justice
blackmun,
20
years
ago,
in
an
opinion,
bohms
v.
gardner
on
the
eighth
circuit,
described
all
the
different
ways
in
which
a
district
court
might
remand
under
that
second
clause.
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
so
important.
i
think
that
the...
the
important
thing
here,
though,
is...
is
the...
the
mechanism
that
comes
after
the
semicolon
in
this
sentence
that
indicates
that
the
parties
shall...
that
the
district
court
shall
retain
jurisdiction.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
your
honor,
as
far
as
applying
to
post-judgment
remands,
i
think
your
honor
means
remands
after
the
claimant
has
answered.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
yes,
your
honor.
although
the
courts
don't
ordinarily
reverse.
they
simply
remand
the
case,
and
that's
what
happened
here.
in
response
to
something
that
justice
white
asked
which
is...
is
about
how...
how
the
secretary
could
get
appeal
of
the
substantive
issue
in
this
case,
i
wanted
to
mention
that
the
secretary
does
have
a
number
of
ways
in
this
case
to
get
this
issue
considered.
what
could
happen
is
that
after
the
proceedings
on
remand,
the
claimant
may
not
be
satisfied
with...
with
what
happened
at
the
remand
proceedings
and
the
claimant
can
return
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
could
then
enter
a
final
judgment,
and
the
secretary
may
be
able
to...
it
can
then
appeal
all
of
the
issues,
including
the
issues
from
the
remand
order.
that's
precisely
what
happened
in
the
second
circuit
in
october
in
kier
v.
sullivan
when
the
secretary
had
this
specific
issue
that
he's
concerned
about
here
decided
after
a
final
decision.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
yes,
your
honor,
that's...
that's
the
mechanism
that
i
described
earlier
whereby
the
secretary,
under
the
statute,
is...
is
required...
if
not
required,
the
secretary
agrees
that
it's
is
appropriate...
that
he
then
go
back
to
the
district
court,
file
the
transcript
of
the
proceedings.
a
judgment
could
be
entered,
and
then
the--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--the
statute
requires
him
to
go
back
to
the
district
court,
your
honor.
it
does,
as
i
believe
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
say
shall
go
back
to
the
district
court.
in
any
event,
the
secretary
admits
that
he
does
in
fact
go
back
to
the
district
court.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
your
honor,
this
whole
idea
of
whether
there
is
a
remand
under
sentence
six
or
sentence
four
is...
is
a
phony
issue.
it
was
an
issue
that
the
secretary
came
up
with
when
he
was
saying
that
he
wanted
to
appeal
from
the
remand
order.
he...
he
interpreted
the
statute
as
though
there
were
remands
under
sentence
six
and
remands
under
sentence
four.
there
aren't.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
your
honor,
the...
the...
it
talks
about
the
taking
of
additional
evidence.
i
think
the
mechanism
in
the
second
clause
of
the
sixth
sentence
would
clearly
apply.
the
secretary
would
then,
after
the
proceedings
on
remand,
be
able
to
go
back
to
the
district
court,
as
would
the
claimant.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
your
honor,
the
district
courts
have...
have
authority
to
remand
aside
from
this
statute.
this
statute
doesn't
really
give
them
power--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--and...
and--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
we
think
that
the
second
clause
of
the
sixth
sentence
would
apply.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
excuse
me?
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
your
honor,
it
says...
there
is
a
semicolon
and
then
it
says,
"and
after
the
case
is
remanded.
"
we...
we
think,
and
the
court
has
indicated,
that
it
applies
to
all
remands.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
your
honor,
we...
we
don't
think
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
is
exhaustive
as
to
all
the
reasons
that
a
court
might
remand.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
perhaps,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
see
that
it
makes
any
difference.
clearly
that
remand
is
still
governed
by
this
same
mechanism.
in...
in
hudson
for
example--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--your
honor,
there's...
there's
no
other
place
that
a
district
court
could
remand
under
this
statute
but
under
authority
of
the
sixth
sentence.
in...
in
hudson,
that
case--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--your
honor,
that
sentence
clearly
doesn't
give
the...
the
district
court
the
power
to
remand.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
no,
your
honor,
and
i'm
not
sure
it
matters
in
these
cases.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
your
honor,
what
the...
the
fourth
sentence
of
this
statute
does
is
it
gives
the
district
courts
the
power
to
enter
a
judgment.
there
was
no
judgment
entered
here.
the
court
simply
remanded.
and
in...
what
the
solicitor
general
is
suggesting
is
that
the
fourth
sentence
applies
to
legal
error
remands
and
the
sixth
sentence
applies
to
fact
remands.
it
doesn't
matter.
the
point
is
that
the...
the
mechanism
in...
in
sentence
six
for
the
district
court
retaining
jurisdiction
applies
to
all
remands.
and
in
hudson
the...
what
the...
in
hudson--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--in
hudson,
your
honor.
that's
what
the
court
said.
and
in
hudson
the
court
was
dealing--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--yes,
your
honor.
in...
in
hudson
it
said--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--basically,
your
honor.
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
yes,
sir.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
yes,
your
honor,
that's
what
the
court
said.
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
i'd
have
to
look
back
at
the
opinion,
your
honor.
in
sentence
six--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--yes,
your
honor.
your
honor,
in...
in...
also
in
the
hudson
case,
it
was
an
improper
application
of
the
vocational
guidelines.
that's
why
the
case
was
remanded
in
that
case,
and
the
court
indicated
that
the
remand
mechanism
applied
to
that
case.
just
two
other
points,
your
honor.
on
the
collateral
order
doctrine,
it's
interesting
that
the
secretary
refers
to
cohen
rather
than
this
court's
decision
in
1978
in
coopers
and
lybrand
and
the
decisions
since
that
which
have
seriously
narrowed
the
application
of
that
doctrine.
we
don't
think
that
at
least
two
of
the
requirements
there
are
met.
and...
and
the...
we
think
that
this
is
not
an
important
issue
in
the
context
of
important
issues
as
this
court
has
determined
that.
this
issue
is
not
completely
separate
from
the
merits.
it's
just
a
purely
legal
issue
apart
from
mrs.
finkelstein's
benefits.
and
also
for
the
reasons
we've
pointed
out,
this
district
court
order
is
not
effectively
unreviewable
later
on.
the
secretary
can
appeal
it.
the
claimant
can
appeal
it.
and
the
secretary
in
the
last
six
months
has
gotten
consideration
and
decision
of
the
first
circuit
and
the
second
circuit
on
the
substantive
issue
he
purported
to
appeal
here.
and
he's
gotten
consideration
in
the
fourth
and
the
tenth
circuits.
your
honor,
if
i
may,--
mr.
kenneth
v.
handal
--that
language
is
at
page
2255
and
the
court
said...
quote...
"as
in
this
case,
there
will
often
be
no
final
judgment
in
a
claimant's
civil
action
for
judicial
review
until
the
administrative
proceedings
on
remand
are
complete.
"
the
court
cites
a
fourth
circuit
decision
in
1983
and
then
quotes
from
it
that
the
procedures
set
forth
in
42
u.s.c.,
section
405(g),
contemplates
additional
action
both
by
the
secretary
and
a
district
court
before
a
civil
action
is
concluded
following
a
remand.
the
secretary
concedes
that
a
remand
order
from
a
district
court
to
the
agency
is
not
a
final
determination
of
the
civil
action
and
that
the
district
court
retains
jurisdiction
to
review
any
determination
rendered
on
remand.
and
that's
in
the
words
of
the
sixth
sentence.
