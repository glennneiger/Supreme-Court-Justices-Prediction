justice
o'connor
mr.
shapiro,
is
it
possible
that
the
statutes
could
be
construed
here
to
provide
that
the
district
court
retains
jurisdiction
at
the
conclusion
of
the
remand
so
that
the
government
would
be
able
to
file
a
motion
for
reconsideration
on
the
point
that
it's
interested
in
at
the
conclusion
of
the
remand
with
the
district
court?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
might
be
somewhat
consistent
with
sullivan
against
hudson,
though.
justice
o'connor
mr.
handal,
under
your
view
how
would
the
government
be
assured
of
getting
eventual
appellate
review
of
the
issue
that
it's
interested
in...
in
having
reviewed?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
the
claimant
prevails
on
remand
under
the...
the
new
theory
of
the
district
court,
how
can
the
government
obtain
review?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
handal,
does
the
sixth
sentence
apply
only
when
the
secretary
makes
a
motion
before
filing
an
answer
in
the
district
court
proceeding?
justice
o'connor
you're
talking
about
sentence
six
in
405(g),
are
you?
