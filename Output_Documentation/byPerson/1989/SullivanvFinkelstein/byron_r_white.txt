justice
white
well,
mr.
shapiro,
i
take
it
that
if...
that
if...
if
the...
your
position
is
that
if
the
case
goes
back,
it's
very
likely
that
the...
and
the
agency
lives
up
to
the
remand
order,
that
there
will
be
a...
the...
the
benefits
will
be
granted.
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
that
the
secretary,
following
the
remand
order,
grants...
there's
benefits
granted.
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
isn't
it?
justice
white
and
you
can
never
get...
you
can
never
have
it
reviewed
then?
justice
white
is
there
a
judgment
entered
then?
justice
white
no.
is
there
a
judgment
entered
then
or
not?
justice
white
in
the
district
court?
justice
white
is
it...
an
actual
judgment
is
filed
just
as--
--[inaudible]
rule
58?
justice
white
no...
no
provision
for,
in
justice
stevens'
example,
no
new
evidence.
justice
white
i
know
it
can
remand.
justice
white
but
it's
talking
about
the
case.
and
as
secretary
shall
after
the
case
is
remanded.
it
sounds
like
it
is
very
much
a
continuation
after
the
semicolon
of
the
language
in
the
first
part
of
the
sixth.
justice
white
did
it
say
that
this
applies
to
all
remands?
justice
white
do
you
have
a
page
cite
for
that?
we
have
a
few
copies
of
the
u.s.
reports
up
here.
let
us
have
that
later.
go
ahead.
justice
white
surely.
justice
white
in
every
case
where
there's
been
a
remand,
must
the
secretary
file
something
in
the...
in
the
district
court?
justice
white
all
right.
so,
your
answer
is
no,
it's
not
in
every
case.
justice
white
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
white
i
understand
that.
but
in
a
case
that's
not
governed
by
the
sixth
sentence,
must
the
secretary--
justice
white
--before
the
case
is
over
must
the
secretary
file
something
and
get
a
judgment
of
the
court?
justice
white
well,
your
opponent
says
that
in
every
case
that
is
the
case.
justice
white
plain
and
simple.
[laughter]
