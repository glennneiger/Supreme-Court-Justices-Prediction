chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
89-504,
louis
w.
sullivan,
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
v.
marilyn
finkelstein.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
that
section
require
a
final
judgment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the...
the
regular
section
providing
for
appeal...
certiorari
to
this
court
from
the
federal
courts
of
appeals
does
not
require
a
final--
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
this...
is
this
argument,
mr.
shapiro,
also
the
one
that
is...
is
analogous
to
our
handling
of
appeals
from
state
courts
in
the
treatment
of
finality
there,
or
is
this
an
alternate
to
that
argument?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
handal.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
the
cohen
v.
beneficial
loan
theory?
chief
justice
rehnquist
not...
not
at
the
time
that
the
district
court
first
issues
its
order,
but
after
the
remand
proceedings
are
completed
and
the...
as
you
say,
the
case
is
then
back
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's...
what's
the
authority
for
the...
for
that
statement?
i
mean,
to
me
the
word
"modify"
doesn't
necessarily
convey
that.
are
there
opinions
from
this
court
saying
so?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i'm...
i'm
asking
you,
and
i
thought
i
had
already
asked
you,
are
there
cases
from
this
court
saying
that
the
word
modify
in
that
fourth
sentence
upon
which
you
rely
would
give
the
district
court
the
authority
to
simply
fix
mrs.
finkelstein's
benefits?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
that
may
be
so.
but
surely
the
second
part
of
the
sentence,
picking
up
after
the
semicolon,
is
dealing
with
the
same
material
as
the
first
unless
there
is
some
clear
indication
otherwise,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
keep
saying
that,
but--
--you
say
that
but
the
sentence
simply
doesn't
support
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
about
four?
with
or
without...
it
says
with
or
without
remanding.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
says,
the
court
shall
have
power
to
enter
upon
the
pleadings
and
transcript
or
the
record
a
judgment
affirming,
modifying,
or
reversing
the
decision
of
the
secretary
with
or
without
remanding
the
cause
for
rehearing.
you
say
that
doesn't
give
the
court
the
power
to
remand?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
you
know,
you're
making
some
very
technical
arguments
and
the
solicitor
general
is
making
some
very
technical...
but
it
turns
out
that
when
you're
pressed
on
the
arguments
and...
you
offer
a
very
literal
interpretation
until
it
doesn't
support
you.
and
then
all
of
a
sudden,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
you
know,
it
could
be
done
this
way
or
that
way.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
said
sentence
six
governed
all
remands?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
it
say
that
in
haec
verba?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
handal.
mr.
shapiro,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
the
case
is
submitted.
