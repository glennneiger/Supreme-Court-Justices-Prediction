justice
scalia
well,
that's--
justice
scalia
--that
depends
on
how
one
reads
the
district
court's
language.
mr.
shapiro,
does
the
secretary
have
a
statutory
right
of
appeal
to
the
district
court
from
a
decision
of
an
agent...
of
the
agency
board
or
alj
awarding
benefits?
justice
scalia
mr.
shapiro,
you've
said
you've
been
consistent
here.
is
it...
is
it
the
government's
position
that
if
the
claimant
had
lost
before
the
district
court...
if
the
district
court
had
agreed
with
the
secretary...
the
claimant
would
have
been
able
to
take
an
appeal
immediately?
justice
scalia
well,
pick
the
branch.
i
mean
what's...
what's
the
government's
position?
can
the
claimant
appeal
or
can
the
claimant
not
appeal?
justice
scalia
well,
but
you
say...
you
say
this
is
a
final
judgment
for...
for
purposes
of
appealability
anyway.
so,
what's
the
government's
real
position?
can
the
claimant
appeal
or
not?
justice
scalia
and
has
the
government
acted
contrary
to
that
position?
justice
scalia
mr.
shapiro,
you've
been
talking
about
the...
the...
you
know,
the
special
application
of...
of
405(g).
what
about
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
generally?
and
i
gather
you
think
this
case
has
implications
across
the
board.
justice
scalia
is
there
any
need
for
a
court
to
remand?
must
a
district
court
remand?
i...
i...
you
know,
the...
the
residual
review
provision
of
the
apa
says
that
if
there's
not
statutory
provision
for
review,
such
as
exists
here
in
405,
the
action
for
review
shall
be
whatever
other
action
is
available.
and
traditionally,
injunction
mandamus,
the
declaratory
judgment,
in
the
district...
in...
whatever
district
court
would
normally
have
jurisdiction
for
those
traditional
actions.
in
such
a
traditional
action,
would
the
court
have
to
remand
to
the
agency?
couldn't
it
just
issue
a
mandamus
telling
the
agency
head
to
do
the
thing
right--
justice
scalia
--and
then
the
matter
would--
justice
scalia
--i
always
thought
it
was
really
sort
of...
i
never
knew...
when
i
was
on
the
court
of
appeals
and...
and
we
had
statutory
review
coming
to
the
court
of
appeals,
i
never
really
knew
whether
we
should
say,
you
know,
reversed
and
remanded
or
not.
what
if
we
didn't
say
remanded,
what
would
happen?
justice
scalia
which...
which
are
still
referred
to
in
the
apa--
justice
scalia
--explicitly.
justice
scalia
well,
but
that--
justice
scalia
--that's
entirely
consistent
with
his
position
that
the
remand
order
is
superfluous,
that's
it's
really
unnecessary,
that
the
only
judgment
that
the
court
made
is
the
legal
judgment
here,
that
that's
the
only
thing
that
was
at
issue.
and
the
remand
is...
is
automatic.
what
would
happen,
the
court
finding
this
way,
is
that
the
agency
would
automatically
be
seized
with
the
case
once
again.
justice
scalia
well,
suppose
it
hadn't?
even
if
it
hadn't,
wouldn't...
wouldn't
the
claimant
have
been
entitled,
given
the
ruling
of
law
that
the
district
court
had
made,
to
have
the
secretary
make
that
finding
of
evidence?
justice
scalia
even
without
the
remand?
justice
scalia
suppose
the
court
had
just
simply
said...
you
know,
reversed.
you
know,
the
secretary's
decision
is
reversed.
and
it
didn't
say
"and
remanded".
wouldn't...
you
mean,
this
claimant
would
not
be
able
to
pursue
her
claim
before
the
secretary?
justice
scalia
i
understand
that.
suppose
instead
of
saying
remanded
it
had
said
reversed?
the
secretary's
decision
is
hereby
set
aside.
justice
scalia
but
that's
not
my
question.
the
question
is
do
you
think
the
claimant
would
have
had
the
right
to
have
further
proceedings
before--
justice
scalia
--of
course.
justice
scalia
so,
the
remand
is
really
superfluous.
justice
scalia
it's...
it's
what
happens
anyway.
justice
scalia
when
you
say
there's
been
no
order
entered
in
this
case
that
depends
upon
what
you
consider
to
be
the
case.
if
you
mean
a
judicial
case,
there
was
an
order
entered
when
the
court
reversed
the
agency.
justice
scalia
but
if
you
choose
to
look
upon
it
as
this
claimant's
long
battle
to
get
money,
then
i
suppose
you're
right.
there
has
been
no
order
entered
in
the
case
in
that
sense.
justice
scalia
a
final
order.
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
okay.
so,
then
just
change
the
word
order
to
final
judgment.
justice
scalia
i...
i
find
what
you
say
just
contrary
to
what...
what
our
traditional
manner
of
handling
these
cases
has
been.
take
a
case,
abbott
laboratories
v.
gardner,
one
of
the
landmark
cases
in
administrative
law
which
involved
a
rule
making
that
was
challenged
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
under
the
residual
review
provision
of
the
apa.
that
is,
it
was
a
suit
brought
for
declaratory
and
injunctive
relief.
the
district
court
held
that
the
fda's
rule
went
beyond
its
authority.
it
was
appealed
to
the
third
circuit
and
it
was
appealed
all
the
way
up
here.
we
didn't
require
the
fb...
the
fda
to...
to
revise
its
rule
and
then
the
revised
rule
somehow
to
be
appealed.
we
allowed
the
appeal
immediately.
and
that's
standard.
justice
scalia
i
find
it
amazing
to
think
that...
that
all
of
these
rule
makings
as
well
as
adjudications
have
to
go
back
to
the
agency
and
a
revised
rule
or
revised
adjudication
made
before
there
can
be
an
appeal.
it
would...
it
would
wipe
off
of
the
books
an
awful
lot
of
cases
that...
that
are
already
there.
justice
scalia
why...
i...
you're
arguing
your
case
just
on
the
bases
of
this
statute
and
you
say
this
statute
is
peculiar.
but
why
should
we
think
that
this
statute
is...
is
any
different
from
what
is
applied
elsewhere
in...
in
judicial
review
of
administrative
action.
justice
scalia
what...
what
indication
is
there
that
this
is
special?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
i
understand
the
first
part
of
the
sixth
sentence
to
mean
that
the
court
may
remand
without
having
made
a
decision,
which
is
unusual.
i
mean,
usually
in
order
for
this
court,
for
example,
to
remand
a
case
we
have
to
decide
something,
that
there's
something
wrong.
we
can't
just
remand
because
we
don't
want
to
decide.
and
i
think...
isn't
that
what
the
first
part
of
the
sixth
sentence
allows
the
court
to
do...
allows
the
court,
upon
that
motion
of
the
secretary,
to
allow
the
secretary
to
mend...
mend
his
hold,
so
to
speak.
justice
scalia
if
the
secretary
says,
you
know,
i'm
worried,
i'm
going
to
lose
this
case,
before
he
files
his
answer,
he
can
ask
the
court
to
send
it
back
so
he
can
take
more
evidence.
justice
scalia
that's
what
the
first
part
says.
and
then
the
second
part
says,
and
it
may
at
any
time
order...
order
additional
evidence.
that,
again,
refers
to
pre-judgment
order,
right?
justice
scalia
i
think
in
its
context,
following
after
that
first
clause,
it
seems
to
me
you...
you
don't
think
it...
it
only
refers
to
ordering
additional
evidence
to
be
taken
before
it
makes
its
decision?
justice
scalia
and
there
are
provisions
like
that
in
rule
making
review
statutes
as
well.
it's
quite
a
common
provision.
justice
scalia
but
why...
if...
if
it
applies
even
to
post-judgment
remand,
why...
why
is
there
that
condition
that
says
only
upon
a
showing
that
there
is
new
evidence
which
is
material
and
that
there
is
good
cause
for
the
failure
to
proceed?
justice
scalia
no,
i
mean
after
the
court
has
found
that
the
agency
is
wrong
and
it
then
remands.
it
says,
the
secretary
should...
should
have
allowed
an
individualized
determination.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
secretary's
decision
and
remand.
at
that
point,
does
clause...
does
sentence
six
apply
in
your
view?
