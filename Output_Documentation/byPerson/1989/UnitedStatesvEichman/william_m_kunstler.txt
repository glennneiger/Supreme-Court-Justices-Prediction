mr.
william
m.
kunstler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
pose
the
question
somewhat
differently
than
was
posed
by
the
government.
we
think
the
question
before
the
court
is
can
the
government
criminally
prohibit
flag
burning,
a
form
of
political
expression
deeply
critical
of
the
government
and
anathema
to
its
officials?
and
i
will
address
three
points,
and
during
them
respond
to
some
of
the
points
raised
by
general
starr.
we
hold,
one,
that
texas
v.
johnson
controls
these
two
cases.
number
two,
that
the
flag
protection
act
can
simply
not
be
upheld
as
an
attempt
to
protect
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag
in
all
circumstances.
and
three,
that
there
is
no
basis
whatsoever
to
accept
the
government's
invitation
to
overturn
johnson.
on
the
first
point,
that
texas
v.
johnson
controls,
all
parties
have
conceded
that
the
defendants'
conduct
below
was
expressive
enough
to
raise
first
amendment
concerns,
and
i
do
not
think
there
is
any
argument
on
that.
number
two,
all
parties
conceded
as
well
that
the
congressional
intent
behind
this
statute
was
to
protect
the
flag
as
a
national
symbol,
and
by
definition
the
governmental
interest
was
only
harmed
by
conduct
expressing
some
message
of
disrespect
or
dissent,
as
indicated
by
justice
scalia.
in
other
words,
the
interest
was
related
to
the
suppression
of
free
expression.
ergo,
the
strict
scrutiny
rule
applies.
then
lastly,
that
the
government
interest
in
preserving
this
symbolic
value
is
not
a
compelling
interest
to
justify
a
criminal
penal
statute
and
jail
flag-burners.
that
is
what
johnson
held.
now,
the
court...
i
must
say
to
the
court,
in
rereading
what
i
said
last
time
in
the
texas
v.
johnson
case,
i
want
a
little
mea
culpa.
in
responding
to
justice
stevens,
i
believe,
i
said
that
the
government
had
no
legitimate
interest
in
enacting
any
legislation
about
the
flag.
i
think
i
was
wrong
in
that
respect,
and
this
court,
of
course,
did
not
adopt
that
argument,
and
i
think
rightly
so.
i
am
persuaded
that
there
are
things
the
government
can
do
with
reference
to
the
flag.
they
can
do
many
things
to
persuade
people
to
respect
it,
to
fly
it,
to
indicate
how
it
should
be
flown,
to
indicate
the
dimensions,
to
indicate
the
type
of
flag
it
should
be
and
how
it
should
appear,
and
they
do
that
in
part
under
title
36
u.s.c.
173
to
177,
but
they
cannot
do
it
in
a
penal
way.
so
i
express
my
mea
culpa
here
in
response
to
that
question
a
year
ago
that
justice
stevens
asked
of
me.
they
can...
they
have
a
legitimate
right
to
regulate
the
flag,
but
not
under
a
penal
statute.
now,
the
government
is
now
arguing,
apparently,
that
there's
now
a
compelling
interest
that
they
have
in
the
flag
because
they
passed
a
new
act,
because
a
new
act
was
enacted
and
became
effective
on
october
28th
of
last
year.
if
the
court
were
to
accept
that
argument
that
the
mere
adoption
of
a
new
act
would
mean
that
you
would
reverse
yourself
in
texas
v.
johnson,
then
i
think
it
would
require
reversing
marbury
against
madison.
but
that's
not
a
sufficient
reason,
merely
because
congress
says
that
it
is
now
enacting
a
new
act
in
an
attempt,
direct
attempt,
to
get
around
texas
v.
johnson.
and
i
call
the
court's
attention
that
when
johnson
was
decided
there
was
a
prior
federal
statute
on
the
books
itself.
they
already
had
enacted
an
act,
and
this
court
was
quite
conscious
of
the
prior
section
700
of
title
18.
and
lastly,
maybe
stranger
than
all,
even
the
congressional
amici
didn't
argue
for
this
position
at
all,
only
for
the
application
of
a
more
lenient
o'brien
standard
or
time,
place
and
manner
standard.
and
they
cannot
change
what
is
obviously
the
court's
duty
in
this
case
merely
by
passing
legislation.
secondly,
with
reference
to
the
question
of
the
physical
integrity
in
all
circumstances
that
are
now
claimed
by
general
starr,
this
was
a
claim
raised
by
the
congressional
amici
that
it
was
a
content-neutral
statute
that
was
enacted
here
and
only
to
protect
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag
in
all
circumstances.
well,
it's
obviously
that
is
not
true
on
the
face
of
the
statute
itself.
first
of
all,
it
is
not
content
neutral.
it
is
content
and
viewpoint
base.
it
singles
out
a
political
symbol,
one
political
symbol,
and
in
our
brief
we
indicated
what
if
that
political
symbol
had
been
instead
of
the
flag
the
democratic
party
flag
or
another
official
flag
of
the
united
states.
and
as
justice
fortas
so
well
put
it
in
tinker,
he
said
it
is
also
relevant
that
the
school
authorities
did
not
purport
to
prohibit
the
wearing
of
all
symbols
of
political
or
controversial
significance.
the
record
shows
the
students
in
some
of
the
schools
wore
buttons
relating
to
national
political
campaign,
and
some
even
wore
an
iron
cross.
the
order
prohibiting
the
wearing
of
armbands
did
not
extend
to
these.
instead,
a
particular
symbol,
black
armbands
worn
to
exhibit
opposition
to
this
nation's
involvement
in
vietnam
were
singled
out
for
prohibition.
clearly,
the
prohibition
of
expression
of
one
particular
opinion
is
not
constitutionally
permissible.
so
it
is
a
content-based
statute.
it
singles
out
one
particular
political
symbol,
just
as
in
stromberg
the
red
flag
was
singled
out
as
one
particular
political
symbol.
and
it
is
viewpoint-based
because
it
proscribes
conduct
which
was
associated
with
dissent,
irrespective
of
the
effect
on
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
it
permits,
as
the
court
knows,
conduct
which
shows
respect,
and
that
is
the
ceremonial
burning
of
the
flag,
which
was
put
in
there
in
order
not
to
penalize
patriotic
groups
who
burn
the
flag...
old
and
soiled
flags,
and
burnt
them
in
a
ceremonial
fashion.
and
then
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
is
just
to
pick
up
all
disrespect
examples,
all
dissenting
examples
maintained
on
the
floor
or
ground.
senator
dole
wanted
that
in
there
because
that
was
days
after
fred
scott
tyler,
one
of
the
appellees
before
this
court,
had
placed
a
flag
on
the
ground
in
that
rather
well-known
chicago
art
institute
exhibit.
physically
defiles,
that
was
senator
wilson's
contribution
to
the
statute
for...
and
he
said
that's
for
acts
that
do
not
do
permanent
harm
to
the
flag.
senator
biden
said
in
response
to
that,
well,
we
have
"defaces"
in
there.
we
don't
need
"defiles",
but
both
"defiles"
and
"defaces"
went
into
the
statute.
and
both
senators
biden
and
wilson
referred
to
conduct
that
does
not
do
permanent
damage
but
injures
the
flag
as
a
symbol.
and
the
word
"defile"
has
a
dictionary
meaning
of
dishonor.
and
yet
it
permits
conduct
which
is
in
essence
which
is
dangerous
to
the
flag
such
as,
i've
already
mentioned,
the
burning
of
worn
or
soiled
flags,
but
it
permits
other
type
of
conduct
that
would
be,
for
example,
flying
in
a
hurricane,
flying
in
a
thunderstorm,
flying
in
a
tornado.
and,
therefore,
it
is
totally
viewpoint
based.
and
as
i
think
mr.
fried
points
out
in
the
brief
for
the
aclu,
he
says
far
from
protecting
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag
in
all
circumstances,
these
terms
protect
the
flag
only
from
those
who
would
hurt
it
or
cast
it
in
a
bad
light.
and
any
statute,
i
submit
to
this
court,
even
one
designed
to
protect
physical
integrity,
in
all
circumstances
would
be
content
based
because
congress'
interest
is...
ultimately
indistinguishable
from
the
flag's
symbolic
value.
why
protect--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--oh,
pardon
me.
thank
you.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
think
myself
that
that
could
be...
and
we've
had
decisions
in
that
respect--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--well,
i
think
when
you're
dealing
with
commercial
use
of
the
flag,
you're
not
expressing
an
idea
that
i
think
is
worthy
of
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
this
is
not
expressive
conduct.
it's
expressive
only
in
a
commercial
sense,
and
this
court
has
never
held
commercial
speech
to
have
that
value.
well,
i
see
what's
bothering
you
because
it's
the
same
thing
in...
on
the
surface
of
it,
but
it
is
not
expressive...
to
me,
expressive
conduct,
which
the
first
amendment
stands
for.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
it's
unworthy
of
first
amendment
protection.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
that's
a
worthy
purpose.
that's
a
commercial
purpose
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
you're
reading
into
it
a
sort
of
a
patriotic
purpose--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--i
know,
but
also
help
the
company
itself,
too.
so
i
think
that...
to
me,
that's--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--no,
but
the...
people
that
burned
these
flags--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--were,
i
think,
under
the
first
amendment
resorting
to
politically
expressive
conduct,
politically
expressive
sentiments
that
are
not
present
in
your
example.
the
only
thing
that
makes
your
example
different
than
justice
scalia's
is
that
you
are
putting
into
it
a
competition
between
american
and
japanese
cars
and
giving
that
a
patriotic
tinge.
but
i
think
it's
still
commercial
speech.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
statute,
both
on
its
face--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--no.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no.
i
think
the
statute
is...
on
its
face
is
unconstitutional,
and
i
think
that
if
a
bunch
of
college
kids
burn
an
american
flag
you'd
come
under
the
facial
aspect
of
the
constitution...
of
the
statute,
that
it
would
be
facially
unconstitutional.
it
doesn't
differentiate--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--it's
vague.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
yes,
but
it's
facially
invalid
because
the
student
doesn't
know
on
the
vagueness
argument
or
the
overbreadth
argument,
doesn't
know,
one,
whether
it's
the
flag
of
the
united
states.
there
are
many
flags
of
the
united
states.
and
doesn't
know
that
the
conduct
itself
is
prohibited.
i
would
put
it
on
the...
on
the
grounds
of...
that
it
would
be
facially
invalid.
now
on
the
grounds
that
you
mentioned,
that
it's
college
students...
well,
i'd
say
it's
not
this
case
anyway.
that's...
i
guess
that's
the
best
way
to
worm
out
of
this.
[laughter]
if
i
have
to
worm
out,
that's
the
way
i'm
going.
it's
not
this
case.
it's
a
hypothetical,
and
it's
not
this
case.
here
there
is
no
question,
as
general
starr
indicates,
about
the
political
message.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
we're
making
a
facial
attack--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--well,
in--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--well,
in
texas
v.
johnson
we
also
made
a
facial
attack,
and
this
court,
as
the
district
courts
below,
did
not
go
into
the
facial
aspect
of
the
statute.
they
decided,
as
you
did
in
texas
v.
johnson,
on
the
as-applied
standard.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
you'd
have
to
get
into
the
facial
aspect
of
it.
but
that,
again,
is
not
this
case.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
there
were
a
number
of
messages.
they
issue--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--i
think
they
convey
them
all.
they're
saying
that...
in
burning
the
flag,
that
they
don't
like
what
the
united
states
is
doing
or
stands
for,
either
on
domestic
or
foreign
policy.
they
all
broke
it
down
into
specifics.
one
didn't
like
the
treatment
of
mexican-americans.
one
didn't
like
the
treatment
of
women.
one
didn't
like
united
states
military
involvement
abroad.
there
were
many.
but
you...
the...
and
the
burning
of
a
flag,
which
doesn't
specifically
say
each
one
of
those...
that
was
the
argument
i
guess
that
general
starr--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--general
starr
made
that...
well,
it's
one
or
all.
it's
one
or
all.
no
one
seeing
the
flag
burn
could
fail
to
get
the
message.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
it's
only
irrelevant
in
the
sense
there
are
documents
being
handed
out,
flyers,
declarations,
that
a
person
will...
he'll
know
from
that
that
the
burning
of
the
flag
exhibited
dissatisfaction.
he'll
know
initially
that
the
burning
exhibited
a
dissatisfaction.
that
person
doesn't
like
something
the
united
states
is
doing.
and
then
it's
broken
down.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
they
did...
they
did
give
the
messages
out,
why
they
burnt
the
flag.
but
the
burning
of
the
flag
itself,
i
think,
even
without
a
message,
would
convey
a
message.
you
see,
general
starr
says,
essentially,
that
the
burning
of
a
flag
by
itself
carries
no
message.
how
do
you
know
what
they're
burning
it
for,
and
so
on.
but,
in
essence,
that's
true,
his
argument
could
prevail
in
any
non-verbal
demonstration.
how
do
you
know
why
anybody
is
doing
anything
with
a
non-verbal
expression?
what
if
they
drew
a
picture
of
uncle
sam
being
hanged,
for
example,
a
caricature?
how
do
you
know
what
they...
express
purpose
is?
but
that's
true
of
all
non-verbal
communication.
and
his
argument
would
prevail...
or
would
be
the
same
i
guess
for
all
non-verbal
expression.
and
you
can't
relegate
non-verbal
expression
to
the
scrap
heap.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
why
you
burn
the
flag.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
that's
true,
you
do
not
have
to
be
precise.
but
with
non-verbal,
where
you
have
an
imprecise
situations...
burning
a
flag,
the
burning
of
the
flag
i
think
is
significant
and
it
doesn't
need
a
prefatory
explanation
of
why
and
each
reason
why
the
flag
is
being
burnt.
in
this
case
you
have
it.
the
record
has
it.
you
have
the
declarations,
and
you
have
the
flyers
in
the
record.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
say
no;
general
starr
says
yes.
because
i
think
he's
basing
the
sentence
on
the
language,
the
first
amendment
language.
i
think
he
can
sentence
within
the
guidelines.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
within
the
guidelines,
i
think
the
judge
can
give
anything--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--if
he
says
that--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--if
he
says
that,
i
think
it's
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--no,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
same
because
there
are
other
factors
to
be
considered
under
the
uniform
sentencing
guidelines.
there's
past
record.
there
are
other
guidelines--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--everything
the
same?
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
think
enhancing
the
sentence
because
of
the
nature
of
the
communication
would
be
unconstitutional.
and
i
would
certainly
appeal.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
still
think
you're
going
on
the
language
itself.
you're
enhancing
not
for
the
act
but
for
the
language.
and
i
think
if
you
do
that,
i
think
it's
unconstitutional.
and
i
would
appeal
that
sentence.
general
starr
thinks
it's
constitutional,
but
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
now,
with
reference...
i'm
just...
with
reference
to
the
invitation...
oh,
by
the
way,
before
i
leave
the
flag
and
the...
i
guess
the
position
that
this
statute
was
designed
solely
to
protect
its
physical
integrity
in
all
circumstances,
i
think
i've
shown
that
it
does
not.
but
i
was
very
interested
essentially
in
what
chief
justice
rehnquist
said
when...
in
his
spence
dissent
when
he
said
it
is
the
character
not
the
cloth
of
the
flag
which
the
state
seeks
to
protect.
and
i
think
that
is
essentially
the
truth
of
this
statute,
both
in
the
congressional
debates
and
in...
and
in
the
position
that
was
taken
below,
which
has
changed
dramatically
now
on
the
part
of
the
government
from
the
position
it
took
below
and
from
the
position
it
took
before
congress
when
assistant
attorney
general
barr
testified
before
the
senate
and
the
house
judiciary
committees.
as
far
as
my
last
point,
the
invitation
to
overrule
texas
v.
johnson,
this
is
a
last
resort
argument,
i
think.
it's
an
argument
based
on
a
recognition
that
texas
v.
johnson
applies
here.
there
have
been
all
sorts
of
methods
here
to
try
to
get
around
texas
v.
johnson.
they've
even
gone
back
to
the
bald
eagle
argument,
which
they
said
down
below
was
a
fallacious
argument,
and
they've
resorted
to
that
here.
but
it's
a
last
resort
argument.
they
know...
the
government
knows
that
texas
v.
johnson
applies.
they
knew
it
when
mr.
barr
testified
before
the
senate
and
house
judiciary
committees,
they
knew
it
in
the
district
court
and
they
know
it
here...
that
it
applies.
they
want...
so
they've
devised
a
method
by
which
this
court
can
say
it
doesn't
apply.
and
they
want
you
to
carve
out
another
exception.
they
want...
like
child
pornography.
they
throw
that
in.
they
throw
in
fighting
words
again,
which
was
specifically
rejected
in
justice
brennan's
opinion
in
texas
v.
johnson.
they
throw--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--well,
that
isn't
really
what
fighting
words
are
as
i
understand
chaplinski.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
it
really
isn't,
justice...
that
isn't
really
fighting
words.
fighting
words,
as
i
understand
it,
is
what
the
jehovah's
witness
did
in
chaplinski
when
he
went
up
to
the
sheriff
and
directly
to
him
said
words
which
would
lead
to
a
fist
fight
between
two
individuals.
but
much
of
speech
provokes
listeners,
this
court
has
said
many
times,
but
maybe
the
highest
purpose
of
speech
is
to
provoke
that
kind
of
reaction.
terminello,
how
far
can
you
go...
i
think
terminello
indicates
how
far
you
can
go.
at
one
point
they
were
even
throwing
things.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
don't
think
that's
really
applicable
here,
because...
well,
that's
not
totally
a
fighting
words
case.
you're
not
dealing
here--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--but...
but
there's
a
point,
i
guess,
where
you
have
a
riot
develop,
and
on
the
verge
of
developing,
where
a
police
officer
can
stop.
and
i
think
everybody
would
admit
that,
there
comes
a
point.
terminello
i
guess
was
close.
feiner
was
over
the
edge.
but
i
think
that
to
burn
a
flag
is
not
that
point.
you
have
no
record
here
of
any
incident
occurring
whatsoever.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no,
i
don't
think
so,
unless
it
were
a
record
were
a
riot
did
ensue
and
police
were
forced
to
come
in
and
take
the
speaker
off
the
rostrum.
that
might
be
a
different
case.
it's
certainly
not
this
case,
and
it
wasn't
texas
v.
johnson,
because
i
think
texas
argued
that
most
stringently
here,
that
it
might
provoke
a
breach
of
the
peace,
and
that
was
one
of
the
considerations
that
texas
said
we
were
advancing,
outside
of
the
symbolic
value.
but
i
think
you've
got
to
have
more.
you've
got
to
go
over
the...
at
least
over
the
feiner
limit...
i'm
using
feiner,
f-e-i-n-e-r...
in
expressing
that--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--well,
i
remember
the
phrase
"clear
and
present
danger"
floating
around
in
my
cranium
at
this
moment,
but
there
has
to
be
something
that
is
way...
so
probable
that
you
are
going
to
have
bloodshed
here,
you're
going
to
have
a
riot,
and
that
doesn't
exist
here
at
all.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
i
think
the
potential
has
to
be
a
probability
of
a
riot,
and
not--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--in
austin?
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
no,
i
don't
disagree
with
it,
because
you
were
going
to
corruption,
to
something
that
would--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--wreck
the
whole
political
system.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
and
i
think
that
is
a
little
different.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
now,
i
take
it
from
that
"oh"
that
you're
not
buying
this.
[laughter]
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
but
i
think
essentially
that
is
a
different
case,
too.
it
does
involve
first
amendment,
no
question
about
it,
in
austin.
and
the
compelling
governmental
interest
was
the
prevention
of
the
corruption
of
the
entire
political
process.
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
well,
you're
using
the
word--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--well,
i
think
that's
a
lot
different
than
what
you
have
in...
going
to
the
corruption
of
the
entire
political
system.
i
think
you
have
something
here
that
will
offend
a
lot
of
people,
maybe
a
majority
of
the
american
people,
but
you
know
what
offends
a
majority
today
may
not
offend
a
majority
tomorrow.
we
have
had
many
things
that
offend
people.
marching
in
birmingham
in
19--
mr.
william
m.
kunstler
--but
justice
scalia,
there's
always
a
potential
in
free
speech,
but
it's
got
to
go
beyond...
i
think
justice
kennedy
used
the
word
probability.
it
has
to
go
beyond
the
potential.
that's
what
texas
argued
here
a
year
ago,
and
in
this
particular
statute,
the
congress'
interest
in
this
statute
had
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
breaches
of
the
peace.
it
wasn't
mentioned,
it
didn't
come
up
in
the
debates
and
was
really
not
the
gravamen
of
what
they
were
doing.
now,
with
reference
to
overruling
johnson,
getting
back
to
this
argument
that
they're
saying
it's
like
defamation,
it's
like
libel
and
slander,
it's
like
obscenity,
child
pornography
and
fighting
words.
i
think
that's
where
we
stop
for
a
moment,
with
fighting
words.
they're
trying
to
carve
out
another
exception
here.
they're
trying
to
say
that
flag
burning
is
not
protected.
we
should
put
it
aside
with
child
pornography
and
defamation
and
libel
and
slander,
and
excise
it
from
the
first
amendment.
that's
what
they're
essentially...
what
they're
saving,
the
same
kind
of
argument
that
i
guess
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
cohen
against
california.
and
in
the
area
of
political
speech,
a
government
cannot
make
judgments
of
what
is
overly
offensive
or
unimportant
speech.
that
simply
cannot
be
done.
the
first
amendment
was
designed
to
forestall
the
majority,
forestall
their
inclination
to
suppress
what
the
government
deems
offensive
at
any
one
time
or
another,
and
many
times
there
have
been
many
things
that
have
been
held
to
be
offensive
to
various
parts
of
our
community,
or
our
national
community,
which
this
court
has
protected
against...
protected
against
government
stopping
it,
arresting
it,
inhibiting
it
or
deterring
it.
i
would
just
like
to
close
with
the
fact
that,
number
one,
that
respect
for
the
flag
must
be
voluntary.
we
can
understand
people's
enormous
feeling
for
it.
i
think
that's
not
difficult
to
understand.
but
it
must
be
voluntary,
and
once
people
are
compelled
to
respect
a
political
symbol,
then
they
are
no
longer
free
and
their
respect
for
the
flag
is
quite
meaningless.
to
criminalize
flag
burning
is
to
deny
what
the
first
amendment
stands
for,
just
what
was
said
in
texas
v.
johnson:
"we
do
not
consecrate
the
flag
by
punishing
its
desecration,
for
in
doing
so
we
dilute
the
freedom
that
this
cherished
symbol
represents.
"
i
would
just
like
to
indicate
that
when
i
reread
times...
new
york
times
against
sullivan
and
reread
justice
brennan's
words
about
the
alien
and
sedition
acts,
it
was
just
193
years
ago,
virtually
to
the
day...
may
16
of
1793...
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
in
a
special
message
to
congress
asked
for
a
statute
which
he
said
would
repel
insinuations
so
derogatory
to
the
honor
and
aggression,
so
dangerous
to
the
constitution,
union
and
even
independence
of
the
nation,
it's
an
indispensable
duty
of
the
congress.
and
they
provided
him
with
that
statute,
and
part
of
that
statute,
the
alien
and
sedition
acts,
had
in
it
a
punishment...
severe
punishment...
for
derogatory
remarks
about
the
president,
the
congress,
the
government
and
so
on.
this
court
did
not
have
its
review
power
then.
marbury
against
madison
was
three
or
four
years
into
the
future,
into
1803,
and
the
statute
was
never
brought
to
this
court.
it
expired
by
its
terms
in
1801,
but
thomas
jefferson,
when
he
became
president
of
the
united
states,
pardoned
everyone
who
had
been
convicted
under
that
statute,
which
is
not
too
dissimilar
from
what
we
are
talking
about
here...
pardoned
everyone...
and
the
congress
voted
to
restore
all
the
fines,
and
in
writing
to...
a
letter...
thomas
jefferson
said,
after
becoming
president,
he
said,
"under
that
statute
it
is
as
if
congress
had
ordered
us
to
fall
down
and
worship
a
golden
image.
"
and
essentially,
that
is
what
we
are
dealing
here
with
now...
a
statute
that
attempts
to
make
the
american
flag
a
political
symbol,
cherished
as
it
is
by
many
people,
into
a
golden
image,
which
takes
it
out
of
the
political
arena--
