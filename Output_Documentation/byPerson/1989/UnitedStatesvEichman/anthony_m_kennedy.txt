justice
kennedy
we
don't
like,
mr.
starr,
to
compare
our
flag
with
any
other
flag,
but
would
you
be
concerned
if
in
eastern
europe
or
some
foreign
country
a
government
punished
demonstrators
for
marching
with
a
defaced
flag
in
support
of
the
demonstrators'
cause
for
freedom?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
isn't
the
point
that
this
is
a
recognized...
internationally
recognized
form
of
protest?
justice
kennedy
general
starr...
excuse
me.
i
assume
that
in
a
country
like...
i
assume
that
in
a
country
like
that
we
would
get
very
annoyed
if
they
let
their
people
burn
the
american
flag.
i
mean,
an
ally
of
ours
at
least.
let's
say
the
french,
who
do
have
a
law
against
burning
the
tricolor.
i
assume
our
state
department
would
protest
if
they
allowed
people
to
burn--
justice
kennedy
did
congress
identify
its
constitutional
source
of
authority
for
enacting
the
flag
statute?
justice
kennedy
we
have
no
authority
for
making
a
criminal
act
against
something
that
violates
our
inherent
sovereignty,
i
take
it?
justice
kennedy
there
is
no
authority
in
this
court
for
making
a
criminal
act
out
of
something
that
violates
inherent
sovereignty?
justice
kennedy
mr.
kunstler,
suppose
that
a
defendant
broke
into
government
property
in
violation
of
a
valid
statute,
took
a
government
flag,
burned
the
government
flag
and
was
charged
for
breaking
and
entering
and
for
destroying
government
property,
not
a
flag
statute
at
all.
and
the
judge,
on
sentencing,
then
says,
you
have
outraged
the
community,
this
is
highly
offensive,
and
i'm
going
to
give
you
the
maximum
sentence.
permissible
under
the
constitution?
justice
kennedy
then
you
must...
then
you
must
give
the
same
sentence
for
spray
painting
the
side
of
a
building
that
faces
a
government
alley
as
for
spray
painting
the
lincoln
memorial?
justice
kennedy
i'm
assuming
that
it's
all
within
the
guidelines,
but
he
gives
a
maximum
because
people
are
outraged,
they
are
offended
and
the
conduct
was
very
public.
justice
kennedy
he
says
that.
justice
kennedy
but
that
happens
in
sentencing
all
the
time.
justice
kennedy
and...
and...
and
based...
and
based
on
your
rule,
it
has
to
be
the
same
sentence
for
spray
painting
the
side
of
a
government
building
that
faces
an
alley
and
spray
painting
the
lincoln
memorial?
justice
kennedy
no,
i'm
assuming
everything
is...
is
the
same.
justice
kennedy
sure.
justice
kennedy
well,
what
about
the
fact
that
it's
public,
that
people
are
outraged,
that
this
is
highly
offensive?
