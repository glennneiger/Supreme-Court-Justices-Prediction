mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
two
cases
bring
before
the
court
a
single
question:
whether
the
first
amendment
prohibits
the
united
states
from
prosecuting
individuals
for
knowingly
burning
a
flag
of
the
united
states.
two
district
courts,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
columbia
and
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
washington,
held
that
the
flag
protection
act
of
1989,
passed
by
congress
in
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
texas
against
johnson,
was
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
conduct
of
the
individuals
here.
in
both
cases
it
is
undisputed
that
each
of
the
appellees
knowingly
burned
a
flag
of
the
united
states
and
thus
violated
the
statute.
in
our
view,
there
are
four
reasons
that
argue
powerfully
in
support
of
the
constitutionality
of
this
statute.
first,
congress
acted
carefully
and
with
great
respect
for
this
court's
decisions
concerning
flag
protection
statutes.
it
took
seriously
the
court's
expressed
statement
in
texas
against
johnson
that
the
inquiry
there
was
bounded
not
only
by
the
facts
of
the
case,
but
by
the
state's
statute
there
in
question.
in
relying
on
this
court's
various
writings
and
decisions
congress
amended
the
federal
statute
in
response
to
texas
against
johnson
to
eliminate
the
prior,
clearly
content-laden
language
of
section
700,
the
language,
"cast
contempt
upon"
and
"publicly".
second,
congress
acted
very
narrowly.
it
focused,
as
this
court
said
in
smith
v.
goguen,
that
it
could
lawfully
do,
on
certain
specific
areas
of
conduct
where
legislative
latitude
is
greater.
and
congress
carved
out
a
narrowly
crafted
set
of
protections
as
to
certain
conduct,
while
permitting
robust
and
uninhibited
speech
to
continue
unabated.
there
was
no
prohibition
on
congress'
part
against
the
publication
or
the
dissemination
of
ideas.
third
and
relatedly,
as
i
will
seek
to
show
in
the
context
of
the
facts
of
these
two
cases,
flag
burning
leaves
a
major
message
gap,
a
gap
that
needs
to
be
filled
in
with
words,
either
written
or
spoken,
as
happened
in
both
the
district
of
columbia
and
seattle
demonstrations.
it
is,
in
our
judgment,
the
equivalent
of
shouting
or
screaming
or
using
a
loudspeaker
at
full
blast
to
arrest
the
audience's
attention.
this
is
not
in
our
judgment
an
especially
weighty
value
on
the
first
amendment
scales.
fourth,
on
the
other
side
of
those
scales
are
interests
of
the
highest
order
in
the
national
community.
those
interests
are
intangible,
to
be
sure,
just
as
the
concept
of
human
dignity
is
intangible.
but
those
interests
are
no
less
real,
rooted
as
they
are
in
the
nation's
history
and
experience,
and
especially
our
history
as
a
community
of
people
in
this
century
in
which
so
many
of
our
co-members
of
the
national
community
have
been
asked
to
sacrifice
so
much.
to
focus
now
on
the
facts
and
the
nature
of
flag
burning.
in
evaluating
the
expressive
content,
the
content
of
this
conduct,
it
is
useful
to
examine
precisely
what
happened
here
and
what
it
is
that
flag
burning
conveys.
this
can
be
seen
by
way
of
example
in
the
statement
of
shawn
eichman,
one
of
the
district
of
columbia
appellees.
ms.
eichman's
concerns
that
animated
her
conduct
were
quite
varied
in
nature.
they
ranged
from
civil
rights
concerns
to
concerns
about
the
environment,
and
concerns
about
certain
aspects
of
u.s.
foreign
policy.
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
the
seattle
demonstration,
a
videotape
of
which
is
in
the
record.
the
concerns
that
were
animating
the
seattle
appellees
ranged
from
a
then
ongoing
labor
strike
at
boeing
aircraft
facilities
in
the
area
to
the
treatment
afforded
hispanic
americans
and
national
policies
concerning
the
homeless.
now
a
passerby
happening
on
these
acts
of
flag
burning
would,
in
our
judgment,
likely
and
reasonably
conclude
that
the
actor
is
in
a
state
of
profound
disagreement.
but
it
does
not
tell
us
with
what.
that
message,
the
what,
comes,
if
at
all,
from
the
speech
that
is
incident
or
tied
to
the
conduct
as
occurred
in
street
against
new
york.
and
that
speech,
of
course,
is
fully
protected,
no
matter
how
offensive
that
speech
may
be
to
the
majority.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
message
itself
enjoys
the
same
protection.
the
question
is
what
message
is
being
conveyed.
if
one
reads
the
statement--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--with
all
due
respect,
that
is
not
what
is
set
forth
in
any
of
the
statements
in
this
record.
what
was
animating
the
conduct
in
this
case
is
as
set
forth
in
the
statements
in
the
record.
they
are
in
the
joint
appendix.
and
with
respect
to
carlos
garza,
his
concern,
as
he
stated
in
his
statement,
was
with
the
treatment
afforded
hispanic
americans.
not
a
word
about
hating
the
united
states.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
that
assumes
too
much,
with
all
respect.
when
mr.
street
burned
the
flag
at
issue
in
street
against
new
york,
his
stated
concerns
were
with
the
failure
to
provide
protection
to
james
meredith,
who
was
not--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
may
in
say...
in
fact
say
too
much,
and
more
than
the
actor
intended
to
convey,
if
in
fact
justice
scalia
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
in
our
judgment,
it
is
conduct,
and
conduct
gives
much
greater
latitude
to
congress
as
long
as
congress
does
not
do
as
the
state
of
texas
did
in
texas
against
johnson,
and
that
is,
pass
a
statute
that
was
not
viewpoint
neutral.
the
way
texas
v.
johnson
was
presented
to
this
case...
to
this
court
was
that
a
conviction
in
that
case
depended
upon
the
communicative
impact.
that
is
not
so
here.
an
individual
runs
afoul
of
this
statute
regardless
of
what
message,
if
any,
that
individual
is
seeking
to
convey.
it
is
the
conduct,
the
six
enumerated,
proscribed
acts
that
are
forbidden,
regardless
of
the
message.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
that's
one
of
the
reasons
congress
saw
fit
to
pass
the
reform
statute
that
has
given
us
sentencing
guidelines.
that
is
precisely
the
sort
of
concern--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--as
long
as
it
were
within
the
statutory
maximum,
i
believe
it
would
be
constitutionally
permitted,
yes.
as
long
as
it's
within
the
maximum.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
what...
it
seems
to
me
that
is
going
on
here
is
that
congress
has
focused
on
a
specific
act
of
conduct,
and
it
has
said,
why
is
it
that
we
are
prohibiting
this
conduct.
it
is
because
this
symbol
is
important
to
us
as
a
nation.
and
congress
in
fact
protects
that
are
important
to
the
nation
in
a
variety
of
ways,
by
virtue,
at
times,
of
its
symbolic
importance.
but
what
we
have
learned
from
texas
against
johnson
and
other
decisions
is
that
those
protections,
those
prohibitions,
cannot
be
tied
to
the
specific
viewpoint.
as
to
the
discretion
that
is
afforded
to
a
district
judge
in
taking
in
a
wide
variety
of
circumstances,
i
think
that
raises
a
whole
host
of
considerations
that
do
not
attain
with
respect
to
a
congress
or
a
state
legislature
making
the
policy
determination:
this
is
important
to
us
because
of
its
symbolic
value.
and
we
can
protect
it
not
against
criticism,
not
against
criticism...
and
it...
and...
and
in
your
district
judge
hypothetical
there
may
be
that
danger,
but
that
is
not
so
here.
congress
read
this
court's
decision
very
carefully,
very
respectfully,
as
well
as
prior
indications
from
this
court,
most
clearly
stated
in
smith
against
goguen,
that
nothing
prohibits
a
legislature...
as
long
as
it
avoids
vagueness
concerns,
nothing
prohibits
a
legislature
from
providing
physical
protection
to
symbols.
in
the
legislative
history
it
was
quite
clear
that
congress
had
presented
to
it
by
eminent
scholars
examples
of
exactly
this
kind
of
protection.
the
statutes
in
force
with
respect
to
prohibitions
of
desecration
of
houses
of
worship,
additional
protections...
stepped
up
protections
for
the
bald
eagle,
not
because
it
is
a
living
thing,
not
because
it
is
an
endangered
species...
it's
not
in
all
western
states...
but
because
of
its
symbolic
value
and
because
it
was
chosen
by
the
continental
congress
to
be
the
symbol
of
the
nation.
that
is
why
that
criminal
prohibition
is
on
the
books,
in
addition
to
any
protection--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
may
very
well...
it
may
very
well--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
that...
i
think
that
raises--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
don't
think
so,
with
all
due
respect.
i
think,
and
i
would
urge
the
court
in
considering
this
entire
issue
of
the
protection
of
symbols...
this
isn't
just
flags.
it's
the
protection
of
symbols.
but
with
respect
to
the
flag,
justice
fortas,
the
author
of
the
plurality
opinion
in
brown
against
louisiana,
the
author
of
the
opinion
in
tinker
against
des
moines
school
district,
a
great
friend
of
the
first
amendment
and
of
symbolic
speech,
said
in
his
opinion,
his
dissenting
opinion
in
street
against
new
york,
the
flag
is
property
but
only
in
a
sense...
it's
not
like
building
your
own
house
of
worship...
because
the
nation
has
an
interest
in
that
flag.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
i
think
that
once
we
move
into
the
religious
area,
we
are
raising
other
values,
namely,
values
in
the
establishment
clause
with
respect
to
how
government
acts.
the
government
can
protect
symbols
but
it
cannot
protect
symbols
in
a
way
that
runs
afouls...
afoul
of
other
provisions
of
the
constitution.
and
there,
in
my
judgment...
i'm
not
answering
the
question
authoritatively,
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
it
clearly
raises
establishment
clause
concerns.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
if
in
fact--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--if
it
is
protecting
it
not
from
criticism
but
from
physical
destruction
or
mutilation...
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
physical
destruction
or
mutilation,
that
one
can
protect
those
things
that
are
special
to
us
as
a
people.
the
fact
that
the
flag
is
individually
owned,
in
my
judgment,
makes
the
analysis
more
complicated,
but
it
does
not
get
us
home
by
any
means
because,
as
i
was
starting
to
say,
what
justice
fortas
said
is
that
it
is
property
even
in
the
hands
of
a
private
citizen
in
a
sense,
but
only
in
a
sense,
because
it
is
property
that
comes
to
us
with
special
restrictions
and
obligations
with
respect
to
its
use.
it
is
because
the
flag
only
exists
by
virtue
of
copies.
the
flags
that
exist
in
this
courtroom--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--in
the...
yes,
the
record
does.
in
the
district
of
columbia
those
were
individually
owned
flags.
in
the
seattle
case,
in
contrast,
the
flag
was
property...
we
have
alleged,
they
have
not
admitted
but
we
have
alleged
that
the
flag
there
was
the
property
of
the
postal
service.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
exactly
right.
count
1
of
the
indictment
in
seattle
charges
destruction
of
government
property,
and
count
2
of
the
indictment
charges
a
violation
of
the
flag
protection
act
of
1989.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
count
1
remains
pending
by
virtue
of
this
being
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
those
are
considerations,
justice
kennedy,
that
are
very
important
for
congress
to
weigh
in
the
balance.
but
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
senate--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
certainly,
at
this
particular
stage
in
our
history,
is
affiliated
or
associated
with
forms
of
protest.
we
don't
deny
the
fact
that
these
individuals
were
engaged
in
a
protest.
what
we
are
saying
is
the
message
of
the
burning
of
the
flag
itself
is
extremely
limited,
is...
we
are
going
to
have
to
have
additional
context
including,
here,
words.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i'm
sorry.
the
protections
are
very
narrow
in
response
to
this
court's
statements
time
and
again
and
certainly
intimations
in
opinions
of
the
court
that
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag
could
be
protected
as
long
as,
now
with
texas
against
johnson,
it's
done
in
a
viewpoint
neutral
way.
one
cannot
punish
a
flag
protestor
because
he
or
she
is
expressing
outrage
about
policies
to
the
country.
what
one
can
do
under
this
court's
teachings
in
prior
cases
and
as
we
read
texas
against
johnson
in
terms
of
its
holding,
that
congress
does
and
should
have
power
to
protect
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag
as
long
as
it
is
not
saying
we
single
out
certain
viewpoints
for
disfavored
treatment.
that
is
the
critical
point
that
congress
was
responding
to
in
reading
texas
against
johnson
and
the
prior
flag
cases.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
would
urge
the
court,
before
it
came
to
that
view
driven
by
today's
newspapers,
to
read
carefully
the
senate's
brief,
the
house
of
representative's
leadership
brief
which
sets
forth
the
history
of
flag
statutes
but
of
instances
in
the
country
in
our
history
where
individuals
were
not
expressing
any
outrage
at
all
against
the
country.
they
may
have
been
expressing
only
a
specific
partisan
sentiment.
for
example--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--thank
you.
[laughter]
i
was
afraid
i
had
been
demoted.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
term
"defaces"
would
in
fact
encompass
activity,
conduct.
it
was
inspired
by
patriotism
as
in
emblazoning
onto
a
flag
permanently,
not
in
spence
v.
washington,
why
did
this
court
spend
a
good
deal
of
effort
in
its
opinion
emphasizing
that
mr.
spence
did
not
deface
the
flag,
did
not
injure
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
an
individual
may
deface
the
flag
by
virtue
of
emblazoning
the
words
onto
that
flag,
"i
love
the
supreme
court".
that
constitutes
defacement.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
exactly
right.
in
fact--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--they
burned
in
addition...
not
these
appellees,
but
during
the
course
of
the
demonstration
there
was
also
burned
the
mcdonald's
golden
arches
flag
from
a
nearby
restaurant.
[laughter]
now,
i
think
this
is
what
this
court
was
getting
at
when
it
spoke
of,
in
spence
against
washington,
acts
of
mindless
nihilism
as
opposed
to
the
acts
that
this
court
has
focused
on
in
spence
and
in
other
cases
where
it
has
found
what
the
court
called
an
intent
to
deliver
a
particularized
message.
there
is
no
particularized
message,
i
agree,
justice
white,
being
delivered
by
these
individuals
here.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that,
i
think,
is
the
most
apt
analogy.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
please.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
most
do,
and
as
the
aclu's
brief
points
out
most
go
considerably
farther,
and
in
fact
make
punishable
acts
of
defamation,
saying
words
of
disrespect
to
the
president
of
the
country
and
the
like.
congress
was
very
clear
in
response
to
texas
against
johnson
that
it
wanted
the
debate
to
go
forward
in
a
robust
and
uninhibited
way
and
merely
to
protect
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
do
not.
we
do
not--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--in
response
to
your
question,
the
state
department
does
not
in
fact
register
protests
as
a
matter
of
routine
policy
when
a
flag
of
the
united
states
is
burned
in
another
country.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
it
may
be
with
respect
to
the
consideration
of
the
interests
of
foreign
governments
we
might
in
fact
seek
to
provide
protections
informed
by
international
law,
but
we
would
have
to
be
guided,
if
we
were
to
do
that,
by
booz
against
barry.
we
could
not
in
fact
punish
any
kind
of
act
of
desecration
or
physical
destruction
based
simply
on
the
viewpoint.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
am
not
saying
we
could
or
we
could
not.
i
think
that
has
to
be
informed
by
international
norms.
i
will
admit
to
the
court
that
i
am
not
deeply
steeped
in
international
norms
with
respect
to
flag
protection,
but
what
i
do
know
is
this,
is
that
congress
was
focusing
on
the
flag
that
it
created.
this
symbol,
unlike
other
symbols...
unlike
the
bald
eagle...
exists
only
because
congress
created
it.
the
flag
of
the
united
states
is
defined
by
federal
law.
congress
created
this
flag,
and
it
is
seeking
in
a
neutral
way,
without
regard
to
the
message,
to
protect
the
physical
integrity
of
that
flag
without...
without
in
any
way
interrupting
the
flow
of
free
ideas
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
there
is
nothing
to
my
knowledge
specifically
in
the
legislative
history.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute,
but
i
would
suggest,
in
my
own
view,
justice
kennedy,
and
that
is
as
an
inherent
act
of
sovereignty
and
certainly
even
if
one
draws
that
into
question,
certainly
with
respect
to
the
army's
and
the
navy
clause,
there
is,
it
seems
to
me
coupled
with
the
necessary
and
proper
clause--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
if
it
lies
within
the
proper
power
of
congress
to
create,
then
it
seems
to
me...
as
long
as
one
answers
that
question
yes,
congress
had
the
power
to
create
the
flag,
then
it
seems
to
me
it
has
the
power
to
protect
that
flag
neutrally.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
is
not
a
sedition
act.
this
is
not,
as
has
been
suggested
in
briefs
by
our
colleagues
on
the
other
side,
punishment
for
civil
blasphemy.
robust,
uninhibited
debate
goes
on,
unimpeded.
congress
felt
very
strongly
about
that.
congress
had
the
deepest
regard
for
this
court's
teachings,
as
well
as
our
system
of
free
expression.
what
it
sought
to
do
was
to
comply
with
texas
against
johnson.
it
heard
testimony
from
eminent
scholars
who
reviewed
the
entirety
of
this
court's
handiwork
in
the
first
amendment
area
and
in
flag
protection
specifically,
and
it
say
a
way,
appropriately,
respectfully,
to,
in
a
narrow
way,
prohibit
conduct,
not
words.
secondly,
it
is
not
so
that
an
act
of
flag
burning
means
"i
hate
america".
carlos
garza
is
one
of
the
washington
state
appellees.
in
his
sworn
statement
as
to
why
he
engaged
in
flag
burning,
he
said
"the
american
flag
represents
the
system
and
the
government
for
which
it
stands.
"
"i
love
and
respect
america.
"
"i
love
and
respect
the
american
people.
"
"i
do
not
love
and
respect
the
way
hispanic-americans
are
treated.
"
in
his
sworn
statement,
darius
strong,
one
of
the
seattle
appellees,
said
that
his
sole
objection
was
with
any
statute
that
might
in
any
way
prevent
someone
from
doing
whatever
that
person
sought
to
do
by
way
of
free
expression.
this
statute
does
not
inhibit
free
expression.
it
prohibits
a
very
narrow
form
of
conduct.
i
thank
the
court.
