justice
stevens
general
starr,
i
wonder
if,
given
justice
scalia's
interpretation
of
the
obvious
meaning
of
this
conduct,
maybe
you
should
try
to
ban
it
on
the
grounds
that
it's
misleading
speech?
[laughter]
justice
stevens
general
starr,
can
i
ask
you
one
question?
justice
stevens
i
may
have
missed
it
because
there
are
so
many
briefs
here,
but
do
you
know
what
the
experience
of
our
other
democratic
nations
is?
do
they
all
have
flag
protection
acts
such
as
this?
justice
stevens
and
also...
they
also
think
it
would
help
the
american
economy,
say,
to
do
this.
justice
stevens
well,
maybe
the
people
who
burn
these
flags
thought
they'd
get
something
out
of
it,
too.
will
that
mean
they
lose
their
rights?
justice
stevens
they
got
a
lot
of
publicity,
didn't
they?
justice
stevens
but
this
case
is
a
case
involving
a
special
message,
as
i
understand
it.
and
what
was
that
message?
justice
stevens
well,
which
one
do
they
convey
by
burning
the
flag?
justice
stevens
it
doesn't
say
any
one
of
them;
it
says
all
of
them.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
stevens
but
how...
if
i
just
see
the
flag
burning,
how
do
i
know
which
one
it
is,
or
is
that
irrelevant?
justice
stevens
call
this...
call
this
number
and
we'll
tell
you
why
we
burned
the
flag.
hand
out
telephone
numbers,
call
this
number
and
we'll
tell
you
what
the
message
is.
