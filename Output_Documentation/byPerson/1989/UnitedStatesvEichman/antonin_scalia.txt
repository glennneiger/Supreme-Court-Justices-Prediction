justice
scalia
general
starr,
i
don't
understand
this
line
of
argument.
is...
is
it
that
you're
saying
that
somehow
the
expression
"i
hate
the
united
states"
is
entitled
to
less
constitutional
protection
than
"i
disagree
with
our
policy
in
eastern
europe?
"
is
that
the
point
that...
that
if
it's
a
political
expression,
it's
too
generic,
too
generalized,
it's
not
entitled
to
the
same
degree
of
protection?
justice
scalia
well,
what
you
convey
by
burning
the
flag
is,
"i
hate
the
united
states".
justice
scalia
by
reason
of
which
he
felt
so
strongly
about
it
that
it
moved
him
to...
to
have
feelings
of
animosity
towards
the
country.
what
else
does
burning...
surely
burning
the
flag
conveys
something.
what
do
you
think
it
conveys
if
it
does
not
convey
the
notion
that,
for
whatever
particular
reason
it
may
be,
"i
am
in
opposition
to
this
country?
"
justice
scalia
does
desecration
of
one's
own...
one's
own
self-constructed
house
of
worship--
justice
scalia
--do
you
think
that
would
be
allowed?
justice
scalia
it
raises
the
same
question
we
have
here.
justice
scalia
but
let's
come
back
to
house
of
worship.
is
it
your...
your
position
that...
that
it
would
be
constitutional
to
ban
bible
burning,
an
individual
burning
his
own
bible?
justice
scalia
we
prohibit
torah
burning
and
all
religious
symbols
that
are
sacred
to
any
religious
group.
justice
scalia
that
would
be
all
right?
justice
scalia
but
in
fact
there
is
only
one
viewpoint:
that
you
do
not
mutilate,
deface,
defile
or
trample
upon
the
flag
in
order
to
show
your
love
for
the
country.
justice
scalia
but
mr.
starr,
you're
missing
my
point.
you
made...
general
starr,
i'm
sorry.
justice
scalia
you
started
by
pointing
out
to
us
that
congress
had
taken
out
of
the
original
section
700(a)
the
phrase
"casts
contempt
upon
the
flag",
but
do
you
really
think
that
in
fact
there
is
any
difference
so
long
as
the
words
that
they
describe
to
protect
the
physical
integrity
of
the
flag
are
"mutilate,
deface,
defile,
burn
or
trample.
"
--i
guess
burn
is
pretty
neutral,
but
if
i
get
a
spot
on
my
tie
i
don't
say,
gee,
i've
defiled
my
tie--
[laughter]
or
if
i
tear
my
jacket
i
don't
say,
my,
i've
mutilated
my
jacket.
these
are
words
of...
cast
contempt
upon.
you
can
take
out
those
words,
but
the
other
verbs
you've
used
contain
the
same
suggestions,
don't
they?
justice
scalia
--don't
you
think
they
would
protest
if
we
allowed
our
people
to
burn
the
tricolor,
although
we
do
not
allow
our
people
to
burn--
justice
scalia
--now,
what
if
the
french
feel
differently
and
they
protest
to
our
state
department?
isn't
it
useful
for
the
state
department
to
say,
hey,
we
can't
even
stop
them
from
burning
our
own
flag?
but
assuming
they...
assuming
that
we
can
stop
people
from
burning
our
own
flag,
don't
you
think
the
french
would
have
good
cause
to
be
insulted
if
we
didn't
let
people
burn
the
french
flag?
or
if
we
allowed
it?
justice
scalia
so
you
are
saying
we
could
prohibit
the
burning
of
the
german
flag,
or,
you
know,
the
iranian
flag...
whatever?
justice
scalia
mr.
kunstler,
excuse
me.
can
you--
justice
scalia
--could
the
congress
prohibit
use
of
the
flag
for
commercial
purposes,
let's
say
a
law
preventing
printing
the
flag
on
beer
cans?
justice
scalia
now
that
worries
me.
why
does
that
differ
from
your
case?
justice
scalia
well,
what
about--
justice
scalia
--what
about
an
american
automobile
company
that
wanted
to
urge
people
to
buy
american
cars
rather
than
japanese
cars
and
could
do
so
more
effectively
if
they...
you
know,
interspersed
replicas
of
the
flag
throughout
their
ads
regularly?
why
wouldn't
that
be
protected?
justice
scalia
so
you
think
if
a
bunch
of
college
kids
at
a
fraternity
party
just
get
together
and
say,
you
know,
just
for
a
kick
let's
burn
an
american
flag
and
they're
really
not
expressing
any
idea,
then
the
statute
would
be
okay
as
applied
to--
justice
scalia
--i
thought
that's
what
you
just
said--
justice
scalia
--that
it
hinges
on
whether
you're
expressing
a
political
idea
or
not.
justice
scalia
no,
i
thought--
justice
scalia
--it's
not
facially
invalid
if...
if
there
is
a
situation
in...
in
which
its
application
would
be
all
right
and
if
its
application
would
be
all
right
as
applied
to
these
college
students
who
have
no
political
idea,
they're
just
having
a
grand
old
time.
let's
burn
a
flag.
justice
scalia
but
you're
making
a
facial
attack,
aren't
you?
i
thought
your
attack
was
facial.
justice
scalia
you
just
want
us
to
let
your
clients
off
and...
and...
and
say,
you
know,
in
other
situations
it
may
be
all
right,
but
here
it
was
no
good?
justice
scalia
i
didn't
think
that
that
was
the
argument
you
were
making,
but
if
you
want--
justice
scalia
well,
why
just
non...
why
do
you
limit
it
to
non-verbal?
i...
it's
verbal,
too.
i
mean,
i
assume
you're
free
to
say,
you
know,
down
with
the
united
states,
or
down
with
germany,
or
down
with
anybody
you
want,
right?
that's--
justice
scalia
--no.
not
even
burning.
i
mean,
even
with
verbal
expression,
you
don't
have
to
be
precise
in
order
to
be
protected,
do
you?
justice
scalia
let's...
let's...
let's
try
fighting
words,
mr.
kunstler.
you
know
texas
v.
johnson
was
a
year
ago,
and
fighting
words
is
no
good
why?
i
mean,
it's
certainly...
it's
certainly
the
case
that
whenever
somebody
tramples
a
flag
or
burns
a
flag
there
is
a
real
potential
for
causing
a
riot,
isn't
there?
justice
scalia
well...
it's...
it's...
it's
the
same...
it's
the
same
thesis,
that
you
don't
have
any
rights
to
engage
in
conduct
that's
likely
to
provoke
a
riot.
justice
scalia
so
there
has
to
be
a
high
probability
of
an
injury
occurring?
justice
scalia
you
don't
think
a
potential...
a
potential
for
a
riot
is
enough?
not
a
potential?
justice
scalia
so
you
disagree
with
our
decision
in
austin,
that
just
came
down
a
couple
of
months
ago?
justice
scalia
yes,
involving
the
restriction
of
corporate
speech,
and
there
we
said,
to
quote
it,
that
the
mere...
presents
the
potential
for
distorting
the
political
process.
we
said
it
was
not--
justice
scalia
--oh--
justice
scalia
--i
see.
justice
scalia
oh.
justice
scalia
i
didn't
buy
it.
justice
scalia
is
preventing
desecration
of
the
flag--
justice
scalia
--and
defending
the
sensibilities
of
the
american
people?
justice
scalia
more...
more
specifically,
the
potential
is
for
causing
a
riot.
i
mean,
the
potential
is
for
physical
harm
to
people.
that
is
the
potential
we
are
talking
about.
it
won't...
but
that
is
a
great
potential.
whenever
somebody
does
something
like
this
to
the
flag,
people
get
mad.
