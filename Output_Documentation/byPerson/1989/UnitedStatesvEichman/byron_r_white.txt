justice
white
well,
general,
i
thought
at
the
outset
you
suggested
that
burning
this
flag
really
didn't
have
any
message
of
its
own
anyway
in
this
case,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
it
was
just...
that
there
was
just
a
flag
burning
to
call
attention
to
some
other
messages
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
flag.
it
was
just
like...
like
you
burned
anything
else
at
the
site.
justice
white
the
only
thing
is
that
in
this
case
they
burned
the
flag.
justice
white
this
is
like
just
an
over-loud
loudspeaker?
justice
white
--so
if...
if...
if
a
person
burned
a
flag
in
order
to
stay
warm
on
a
cold
winter
night,
you
would
have...
in
order
to
get
your
client
off
on...
on
those
facts
you
would
get
into
overbreadth?
justice
white
well,
that's
probably
why
we're
here
today.
[laughter]
