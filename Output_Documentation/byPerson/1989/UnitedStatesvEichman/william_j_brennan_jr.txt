justice
jr.
are
you
saying
that
this
is
an
invalid
form
of
protest?
justice
jr.
well,
suppose...
suppose
we
uphold
the
statute
and
sustain
your
position,
and
on
sentencing,
a
district
judge
said,
because
you
have
outraged
the
community,
because
your
protest
was
so
public,
because
you
have
offended
so
many,
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
harsh
sentence.
is
that
a
proper
exercise
of
the
sentencing
function?
justice
jr.
i
don't
know
if
it's
in
the
guidelines
or
not,
but
suppose
that,
permissibly
within
the
guidelines,
the
district
court
said
that.
would
that
be
constitutionally
permitted?
justice
jr.
but
isn't
that
precisely
what
we
said
could
not
be
done
in...
in
the
gregory
case?
justice
jr.
well,
you
can
take
it
two
ways.
on
the
one
hand
it's
limited.
on
the
other
hand
it's
so
pervasive,
so
general.
your
original
argument
was
that
it
was
so
general,
so
all-encompassing
that
it
was
not
worthy
of
protection.
now
you're
saying
that
it's
very
narrow.
i
not
sure
which
it
is.
