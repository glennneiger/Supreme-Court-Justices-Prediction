mr.
anthony
t.
caso
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
rightly
or
wrongly
individuals
in
our
society
are
judged,
categorized
and
characterized
by
their
associations.
it
is
in
fact
how
we
define
ourselves.
today's
case
concerns
the
freedom
to
choose
those
types
of
associations
by
which
we
will
be
judged.
an
example
from
recent
history
is
very
relevant.
earlier
this
month
at
its
convention,
the
american
bar
association
adopted
a
resolution
on
the
question
of
abortion
rights.
a
40-year
member
of
that
association,
an
officer,
was
so
offended
by
that
particular
ideological
position
that
he
felt
compelled
to
announce
his
resignation.
the
members
of
the
california
bar
association
have
no
similar
right.
this
case
does
not
challenge
the
right
of
california
to
regulate
attorneys
through
a
mandatory
bar
association.
instead,
it
asks
whether
having
done
so,
may
it
also
authorize
the
bar
to,
in
the
words
of
the
california
supreme
court,
comment
generally
upon
matters
pending
before
the
legislature.
so,
both
the
right
to
the
freedom
of
association
and
the
freedom
of
speech
are
before
the
court
in
this
case.
speech
rights
are
implicated
by
compelled
dues
payments
that
are
then
used
for
political
and
ideological
purposes,
while
association
rights
are
implicated
by
compelled
membership
in
an
expressive
association.
infringements
upon
these
rights
may
be
justified
only
by
a
compelling
state
interest.
the
bar
in
this
case
identifies
no
such
interest,
yet,
instead,
seeks
a
blanket
exemption
under
the
so-called
government
speech
doctrine.
all
attorneys
in
california
are
required
both
to...
to
belong
and
pay
an
annual
dues
payment
to
the
state
bar
in
order
to
maintain
their
license
to
practice
law.
in
addition
to
its
many
regulatory
activities,
the
bar
also
engages
in
activities
we've
identified
as
political
and
ideological.
these
include
lobbying
on
issues
that
range
from
environmental
questions
to
criminal
penalties.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
if
it
is...
if
it
is
supported
by
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
in
other
words,
if
there
is
a
reason
for
california
to
force
these
people
together
into
an
association
and
pay
a
fee
for
that
purpose.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
yes.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
again,
if
the
state
identifies
that
as
an
interest
for
forcing
all
attorneys
into
an
association--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--i
don't
believe
so
because
i
believe
that
there's
an
underlying
public
policy
purpose
behind
such
legislation
that
doesn't
extend
to
a
reason
for
california
to
force
these
people
into
a
group,
to
force
them
to
pay
a
fee
to
make
that
type
of
a
political
judgment.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
indeed,
that
is
what
this
court
did
in
lathrop.
but
when
the
state
also
authorizes
the
bar
to
go
beyond
that,
it's
petitioners'
position
that
they
must
identify
what
state
interest
they
are
fulfilling.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
if
indeed
they
are
offshoots.
and
the
way
the
court's
test
would...
would
look
at
that
is,
is
this
actually
advancing
the
compelling
state
interest
in
the
least
drastic
means.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court
in
lathrop
used
those
terms.
i
know
when...
at
the
end
of
the
analysis
in
the
plurality
decision
the
court
was
just
looking
at,
given
these
things
that
the
bar
is
doing,
the
state
is
promoting
an
interest
to
improve
the
delivery
of
quality
legal
services.
so,
it's
not
looking
at
the
types
of
political
conduct
that
the
bar
in
this
case
engages
in.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
it
was
both--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--a
speech
and
association
case,
and
only
the
association
issue
was
decided.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
it...
it...
there
can
be
underlying
compelling
state
interest.
and
let's
take
the
lathrop
example.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
well,
to
take
the
lathrop
example,
improving
the
quality
of
legal
services.
if
the
state
legislature
holds
sway
on
those
particular
issues,
the
bar
should
be
able
to
go
to
the
legislature
and
lobby,
for
instance,
on
an
issue
relating
to
the
qualifications
for
a
law
school,
the
qualifications
one
must
possess
before
they
could
take
a
bar
examination.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
no,
your
honor.
i'm
saying
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest...
the
base
compelling
is
what
i
believe
was
recognized
in
lathrop,
was
improving
the
quality
and
delivery
of
legal
services.
and
that
base
would
then
allow
the
bar
to
go
and
lobby
on
issues
that
are
related
to
that,
that
actually
advance
that
interest.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
it
would
not
have
to
do
that.
it
wouldn't
be--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--it
would
be
authorized.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
and
again--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--precisely,
and
your
rights
are--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--your
rights
are
infringed.
it's
okay
because
the
state
has
identified
a
compelling
interest
that
allows
it
to
overcome
your
individual
right
of
dissent
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
again,
i'm
going
back
to
lathrop.
the
interest
recognized
was
improving
the
quality
and
delivery
of
legal
services.
california,
in
this
case,
has
identified
no
interest
at
all.
there
is
none
in
this
record.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
abood
first
talks
about
the
importance
of
the
state's
interest.
it
doesn't
use
the
word
compelling
state
interest.
germaneness
comes
in--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
the
germaneness
question
in
abood
comes
into
then
is
what
we're
allowing
issues
to
be
spent
upon,
is
that
germane
to
the
state's
interest?
in
other
words,
is
it
related?
is
the
state's
interest
actually
advanced?
when
this
court
decided
the
decision
in
chicago
teachers
v.
hudson,
it
did
refer
in
a
footnote
to
the
compelling
state
interest
test
in
association
and
speech
cases
of
this
type.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
in
this
case,
we
have
the
entire
range
of
bar
conduct.
they
have
been
prohibited
from
doing
nothing.
the
court
below
said
laws
are
the
business
of
lawyers
and,
therefore,
we
give
the
state
bar
of
california
the
right
to
comment
generally
on
all
matters
that
come
before
the
legislature
without
restriction.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
that
was
the
one
restriction,
was
the
political
campaign.
there
is
a
question
about
ballot
initiatives,
because
the
record
does
reflect
that
the
bar
had
adopted
resolutions
supporting
ballot
initiatives,
but
the
court
did
not
specifically
say
that
that
was
not
okay.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
i
don't
believe
so.
nor
are
they
allowed
to
do
so
under
legislation
that
was
passed
after
they
had
done
so
in
this
case.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
certainly.
in
fact,
we
would
be--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--we
would
be
adopting
lathrop
as
the
base
and
this
is
what
we
have
found
to
be
a
sufficient
interest
for
the
state
to
force
all
attorneys
into
an
association.
if
they
wish
to
do
something
beyond
those
things,
beyond
the
delivery...
improving
the
quality
of
legal
services
or
improving
its
delivery,
they
must
identify
what
the
state's
interest
is.
they
have
not
done
that.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
i
would
argue
that
the
interest
found
by
the
court
to
justify
the
association
in
lathrop
arises
to
the
level
of
a
compelling
interest,
as
did
the
dissent
in
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
that's
true,
your
honor.
the...
the
phrase
v.
jaycees,
and
the
compelling
state
interest
was
used
in
restricting
association
rights.
and,
again,
we
have
here
an
expressive
association.
the
bar
looks
to
shield
its
conduct
as
a
governmental
entity.
it
says
the
first
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
us
in
this
case,
dissenters
have
no
right
to
complain.
we
have
to
look
at
what
type
of
an
entity
the
bar
is,
how
it
functions.
it
functions,
for
the
most
part,
as
a
an
autonomous
entity.
it's
governed
by
a
board
of
governors
that's
partially
elected,
partially
appointed.
it's
given
extensive
control
over
bar
operations.
it's
not
supported
by
general
tax
revenues;
instead,
it's
supported
by
compelled
dues
payments
of
the
petitioners.
this
money
goes
directly
to
the
state
bar's
treasury,
not
to
the
state
treasury.
when
the
bar
seeks
to
spend
that
fund,
it
spends
it
on
the
authority
of
the
vote
of
the
board
of
governors.
it
need
not
go
to
the
legislature
for
an
appropriation,
it
need
not
be
reviewed
by
the
governor,
it
is
not
subject
to
the
governor's
veto,
line
item
veto,
or
reduction
of
powers.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
i
believe
approximately
120,000.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
because
the
state
has
compelled
this
group
together.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
cities...
cities
have
at
least
some
element
of
voluntariness.
in
fact,
that's
what
the
right
to
travel
is
all
about.
but
here
we
are
compelled
together
into
an
association
if
you
wish
to
practice
this
occupation.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
there
is,
and
the
teachers
in
abood
don't
have
to
be
teachers
in
that
school
district
either.
again,
we've...
we've
taken
this
particular
discrete
group,
a
more
compelling--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--they
didn't
have
to
work
in
that
school
district.
they
could
have
moved.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
uh-huh.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
here
it's
the
fact
that
one
wants
to
practice
this
particular
profession,
the
state
places
a
burden
on
that.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
it
says
in
order
to
do
so
you
have
to
belong
to
this
group
and
you
have
to
pay
this
group
a
fee.
and
so
we
look
to
why
can
the
state
do
that,
where
is
the
state's
interest?
if
it's
a
regulatory
interest,
that's
fine.
but
does
that
interest
extend
to
allowing
that
group
to
engage
in
the
type
of
political
activity
at
issue
here?
and
the
question
comes
up
is
what
type
of
an
entity
is
the
bar.
it
is
in
fact...
at
least,
purports
to
be...
the
sum
of
its
members.
when
it
speaks,
it
purports
to
do
in
a
representative
capacity.
the
bar
may
attempt
to
deny
this
in
a
portion
of
its
brief,
but
then
it
later
claims
majority
support
for
some
of
its
positions.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
well,
the
precise
definition
of
that
term
is
the
precise
problem
in
this
case,
your
honor.
the
california
supreme
court
defined
the
term
administration
of
justice
to
be
essentially
meaningless.
we
have
no
idea
what
those
words
mean.
when
they
looked
at
that,
they
said,
that's
the
bar's
purpose.
now,
laws
are
the
business
of
lawyers;
therefore,
they
may
comment
on
any
issue
that
comes
before
the
legislature.
that...
that
becomes
administration
of
justice.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
you...
you
would
first
have
to
find
that
a
grant
of
authority
that
broad
to
comment
on
anything
that
comes
before
the
legislature
is
itself
a
sufficient
interest
of
the
state
to
compel
attorneys
into
an
association,
to
compel
them
to
pay
a
fee.
then
they
can
argue
that
what
we
do
is
related
to
that.
but
the
first
step
is,
is
that
an
important
enough
interest?
we
argue
that
it
has
to
be
a
compelling
interest.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
abood,
i
believe,
uses
the
words
"sufficiently
important".
hudson,
chicago
teacher's
union
uses
the
words
v.
jaycees.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
but
lawyers
are
very
public
people,
your
honor,
and
they
are
going
to
be
branded
by
these
positions
simply
because
the
only
essence
of
the
bar's
speech
is
that
it
claims
to
be
that
of
its
members.
in
other
words,
let
me
put
it
in
the
words
of
the
california
legislature--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--let...
let
me
take
an
example
from
recent
history.
a
judge
in
california,
judge
walker,
has
just
gone
through
a
very
bruising
confirmation
process.
one
of
the
issues
was
he
belonged
to
a
private
club
that
had
a
restrictive
membership
policy.
that
policy
was
branded
on
him
even
though
he
got
up
and
said,
"i
disagree
with
that".
he
got
up,
and
he
attempted
to
change
that
policy,
but
until
he
resigned,
he
was
branded
with
that
policy.
we
are
very
public
people.
these
positions...
the
association
itself
is
a
factor
in
how
the
public
defines
us.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
precisely,
your
honor.
those
were
speech
cases.
and
like
i
said,
this
case
has
both
elements,
speech
and
association.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
correctly,
your
honor.
and
again,
it
has
both
those
elements.
and
the
reason
abood
came
out
differently...
you
remember
in
abood
the
petitioners
in
that
case
asked
for
an
injunction
against
the
activity
and
the
court
says,
no,
you
can't
have
it.
and
the
reason
is
that
the
underlying
union
in
abood
is
itself
a
voluntary
organization.
people
that
have
an
independent
first
amendment
right
to
join
together
on
political
issues.
that's
what
a
union
is.
the
california
bar
is
not
a
similar
entity.
there
are
no
voluntary
members.
there
is
no
underlying
core
that's
exercising
first
amendments.
it's
an
artificial
construct
that
exists
only
by
compulsion
of
the
state.
to
effectuate
these
rights
i
believe
the
court
has
a
range
of
alternatives.
for
the
speech...
freedom
of
speech
issues,
the
remedy
is
clearly
laid
out
in
the
hudson
decision,
and
it's
very
clear
and
easy
for
anyone
to
follow.
as
far
as
associational
rights,
i
believe
this
court
can
identify
those
clearly
permissible
activities
which
the
state
does
have
an
interest
to
compel
attorneys
together
into
an
association
and,
indeed,
they've
done
so
in
the
lathrop
case.
again,
i--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--yes,
your
honor.
if
you
agree
with
me
on
the
association
issue,
then
there
is
going
to
be
no
dues
reduction
plan.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
you
just
focus
on
the
speech
problem,
then
a
hudson-type
remedy
will
have
to
be
established.
so,
in
other
words,
the
association
issue
will
subsume
the
speech,
but
the
speech
alone
requires
a
different
remedy
if
that's
the
only
remedy
that
you
are
willing
to
give
relief
on.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
of
the
court,
i
will
reserve
my
remainder.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
thank
you,
your
honor.
indeed,
the
vast
majority
of
the
bar's
budget
does
go
to
these
other
activities
and
thus,
unlike
what
the
bar's
amici
would
say,
the
world
will
not
end
if
petitioners
prevail
in
this
case.
a
question
from
the
bench
related
to
what
was
the
scope
of
authority
to
the
bar
under
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court.
in
volume
iii
of
the
appendix
at
page
576,
the
court
notes,
"if
the
bar
is
considered
a
governmental
agency,
then
the
distinction
between
revenue
derived
from
mandatory
dues
and
revenue
from
other
sources
is
immaterial.
"
"a
governmental
agency
may
use
unrestricted
revenue,
whether
derived
from
taxes,
dues,
fees,
tolls,
tuition,
donation,
or
other
sources,
for
any
purpose
within
its
authority.
"
now,
what
is
the
bar's
authority?
it
continues
the
use
the
phrase,
"administration
of
justice".
indeed,
this
court
used
that
phrase
in
the
lathrop
case.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
your
judgment
will
be
that
the...
the
bar
can
do
those
things
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in,
and
if
it
wishes
to
do
other
things,
it
must--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--that
the
state
has
an
important
or
compelling
interest.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
there--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--the
court
has
already
ruled
that
there
may
be
a
mandatory
bar
association
when
the
state's
purpose
is
to
improve
the
quality
and
delivery
of
legal
services.
the
question
now
is--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--is
having
done
that--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--what
does
that
term
mean?
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
under...
in
the
court
below,
that
term
is
limitless,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
in
lathrop,
the
court
looked
at
very
specific
examples
of
what
was
happening,
continuing
legal
education,
admission
and
discipline
of
attorneys.
ethics,
opinions
of
the
advisory--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--no,
your
honor.
that
doesn't
relate
to
the
delivery
of
legal
services.
that's
the
mechanical
function
that
attorneys
do.
we
go
out
and
represent
people,
that's
the
delivery
of
legal
services.
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
was
talking
about
in
the
lathrop
decision,
improving
the
quality
of
that.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
that's
right.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
i'm
not
sure
it
is
that
small.
when
this
case
began
in
19--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--yes,
your
honor.
let
me
explain.
in
1982,
when
this
case
began,
the
bar
was
identifying
approximately
16
to
17
percent
of
its
budget
as
administration
of
justice
functions.
since
that
time,
however,
there's
been
a
tremendous
increase
in
dues
that's
devoted
exclusively
to
discipline.
and
i
haven't
attempted
to
calculate
what
percentage
of
its
budget,
but
at
that
time,
when
this
case
began,
the
dues
were
approximately
$200.
we
were
talking
about
16
to
17
percent
of
its
budget
as
the
total
amount
devoted
to
this
type
of
activity.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
correct.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
it
can
change
the
law
when
the--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--state
has
that
interest.
again,
we
have
to
start
from
the
state
ground,
is
that
the
state
has
to
identify
why
is
it
doing
this.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
i
go
back
to
the
1982
figures
as
my
base
point.
and
i
would
say
the
great
majority
of
that
16
to
17
percent
would
fall
within
an
objectionable
portion.
and
the
reason
again,
your
honor,
just
to
say
administration
of
justice...
and
that's
all
the
california
supreme
court...
just
to
say
the
words--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--but...
but
the--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--california
supreme
court
has...
has
laid
down
the
definition
of
what
those
terms
mean
in
california,
what
those
terms
mean
in
this
statute.
laws
are
the
business
of
lawyers
is
what
they
said.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
anything--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--we're
not
opposed
to
the
words
in
the
statute.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
it's
the
way
california
defined
them,
your
honor.
and
let
me
give
you
an
example.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
the
remedy
this
court
should
issue
is
that...
to
decide
the
bar
is
well
within
its
power
to
use
mandatory
association
and
mandatory
fees
to
finance
those
activities
related
to
the
delivery
of
quality
legal
services,
as
this
court
determined
in
lathrop.
if
the
bar
wishes
to
go
further,
it
must
identify
an
interest
of
the
state
that
is
compelling.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
certainly
when
i
go
back
to
the
courts
in
california
with
this
decision
it
will
be...
i
don't--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--your
honor,
on
the
association
rights
we
want
an
injunction.
on
the
speech
rights,
if...
if
that's
all
the
court
is
going
to
grant
relief
on
is
the
speech
rights--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--then
the
refund
solves
the
problem.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
that
does
not
take
care
of
what
we
assert
are
the
association
rights
at
stake
here
because
this
is
an
expressive
association
that
they're
compelled
to
be
members
of.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
it
does
take
care
of
the
speech
claims.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
sure.
and,
your
honor,
perhaps
it's
best
to
look
at
this
case,
can
california--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--compel
all
doctors--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--interest
that
would--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--okay.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
okay.
but
that
interest
has
to
be
related--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--no.
no,
your
honor.
the
interest
has
to
be...
has
to
grant
the
state
a
reason
to
compel
these
people
here,
attorneys
only,
into
a
group
for
that
purpose.
that's
where
the...
if
you
go
back
to
the
abood
case,
the
reason--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--certainly
i
don't
think
you
can
delegate
to
a
voluntary
association
a
regulatory
function.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
well,
certainly,
and
there
are
a
number
of
those
associations,
and
the
legislature
is
better
served
because
only
those
people
that
want
to
belong
to
that
association
are
making
that
message
and
the
legislature
is
better
able
to
evaluate
it
in
that
respect.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
well,
this
court
has
recognized
that's
okay
for
the
state
to
do,
for
discipline
matters,
for
continuing
legal
education,
for
ethics
requirements.
these
are
things
that
the
state
can
compel
attorneys
into
an
association
for.
the
court
below
would
say
it
can
go
beyond
that
and
"comment
generally
on
any
matter
before
the
legislature.
"
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
go
back
to
the
fact
that--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--well,
again,
i'd
just
have
to
go
back
to
the
fact
that
california
has--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--unfortunately
i
didn't
provide
a
real
clear--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--i
did
not
provide
a
clear
definition
of
that
in
my
papers,
and
i
apologize
for
that,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
what
you
can
do
is
reverse
the
decision--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--what
you
can
do
is
reverse
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
that
says
that
the
state
bar--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--is
a
governmental
agency
and
can
do--
mr.
anthony
t.
caso
--no,
your
honor.
you
can
reverse
the
decision
on
those
grounds
and
require
the
state
to
articulate
an
interest,
which
it
has
not
done
in
this
case
because
it
never
reached
that
level
of
analysis.
it
said
this
is
a
governmental
agency,
it
can
do
anything
any
other
governmental
agency
can
do
without
first
amendment
restriction
as
far
dissenting
minorities
or
dissenting
members.
the
state
has
not
articulated
that
interest.
thank
you,
your
honor.
