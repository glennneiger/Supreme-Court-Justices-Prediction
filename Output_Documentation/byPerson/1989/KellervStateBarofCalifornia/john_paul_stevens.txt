mr.
caso,
how
many
members
of
the
bar
are
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
is
it
different
than
a
city
having
a
population
of
120,000?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
don't
have
to
live
in
berkeley--
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
they
had
to
have
the
union.
they
had
to
have
the...
be
represented
by
the
union.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
know.
but
if...
the
fact
of
working
in
the
school
district
is
not
what
gave
rise
to
their
problem.
i
mean,
had
there
been
no
union,
they
could
have
worked
in
the
school
district
and
had
no
compelled
speech.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
just
living
in
berkeley
or
boise,
or
wherever
it
is,
or
being
a
member
of
the
bar
is
what
does
it
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
hufstedler,
didn't
they
also
ask
for
a
refund
of
money
that
had
been
used
to
support
political
activities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
paragraph
3
of
the
prayer
of
the
complaint
asked
for
an
injunction
compelling
respondent
defendants
to
reimburse
the
treasury
of
the
state
bar
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
i
thought
it's
just
exactly
what
you...
page
7
of
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
they
asked
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
they
barred,
as
a
matter
of
pleading,
you
say,
from
asking
for
this
relief
now?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there
are
other...
there
are
other
examples
in
the
record,
are
there
not,
of
things
for
which
the
bar
lobbied
that
could
be
characterized
as
not
strictly
professional
issues,
such
as
armor-piercing
bullets
and
environmental
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
it
also
an
issue
on
which
policy-makers
could
have
disagreements
that
are
unrelated
to
their
professional
skills?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
left
out
one
step,
mr.
hufstedler.
you
said
they
could
be
asked
to
formulate
a
position.
surely
they
could
do
that.
could
they
go
further
and
lobby
for
that
position
using
the
funds
that
these
other
people
who
don't
agree
with
the
position
have
donated?
that's
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
i
asked
you
about
the
lobbying
for
capital
punishment
you
said
there
were
two
answers,
one
was
the
state
agency
answer
and
you
never
told
us
your
second.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
question,
because
the
administration
of
justice
obviously
can
be
a
large
or
small
term--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--depending
on
what
you
include
in
it.
your
opponent
suggested
really
what
you're
fighting
about
is
less
than
a
very
small
fraction
of
one
percent
of
the
budget
of
the
bar
association.
and
you
sort
of
accepted
that
when
you
got
up
a
moment
ago
and
said,
that
proves
that
the
case
really
won't
hurt
anybody
because
you'd
just
have
to
take
ten
cents
a
year
of
their
dues,
or
something
like
that.
do
you
agree
that
the
area
of
controversy
is
that
small?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
about...
what's
your
judgment?
i
mean,
obviously
at
least
two-thirds
of
it
is
noncontroversial.
the
discipline
stuff
is
okay,
i
guess--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
you
don't
object
to
all
of
this--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--as
i
understand
your
brief.
you
agree
that
you
can
reform
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
that
sort
of
thing,
don't
you?
have...
have
bar
money
spent
on...
or
do
you
think
it
can
do
nothing
to
change
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean
to
lobby
for--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
it
wants
to
improve
the
administration
of
justice,
and
there's
an
area
of
dispute
about
what
that
includes.
and
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
because
i
really
think
there
is
some
vagueness
in
your
position
as
to
how
many
of
these
things
you
really
object
to.
do
you
have
any
idea
of
what
percent
of
the
budget
you
think
is
improperly
spent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
know,
but,
see,
you
do
have
a
remedy
on
specific
issues
you
disagree
with.
you
could
go
into
state
court
and
say
this
is
beyond
the
statutory
definition.
you
probably
could
get
mr.
hufstedler
to
argue
your
case
for
you
on
some
of
these
things--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--like
the
nuclear
freeze.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
does
take
care
of
your
free
speech
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
refund
of
about
$10
out
of
the
$200
would
do
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
according
to
mr.
hufstedler--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
refund
of
about
25
cents
out
of
that
$200
would
do
it.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out.
whether
it's
$10
or
15
cents.
counsel,
i
still
don't
understand
how
your
compelling
interest
works.
that
the
bar
can
go
further,
it
can
do
these
activities
if
the
state
identifies
a
very
significant
and
important
interest
you
said.
