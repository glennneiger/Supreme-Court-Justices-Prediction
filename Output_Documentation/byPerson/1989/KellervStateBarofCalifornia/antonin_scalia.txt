justice
antonin
scalia
indeed,
lathrop
didn't
involve
speech
at
all,
did
it?
so
you'd
never
get
into...
what
was
it...
a
speech
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--only
the
association
issue
was
decided.
there
wasn't
any
compelled
speech
by
anybody.
i
thought
your
position
was...
and
your
answers
didn't
seem
to
indicate
this...
but
i
thought
your
position
was
that
it
can't
be
a
compelling
state
interest
to...
to
make
the...
the
organized
bar
lobby.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
make
them
lobby.
what...
what...
what
would
be
the...
the
example
in
which
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
state
bar
to
lobby
to
compel--
justice
antonin
scalia
--uh-huh.
well,
what
if
i
disagree
with
that
position
of
the
bar
even
though
it's
an
issue
that
relates
to
lawyers?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
dues
are
still
going
to...
to
subsidize
that
lobbying
against
a
position--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
say
that
would
be
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
you
don't
have
to
be
a
lawyer,
just
as
you
don't
have
to
live
in
boise.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
certain
amount
of
voluntary...
voluntariness
in
both
of
those
things,
isn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
the
two...
are
the
two
coextensive,
and
would...
would
you
agree
that
any
member
of
the
california
bar
has
to
pay
for
whatever
activities
we
conclude
the
bar
association
may
engage
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
qualifications,
mr....
mr.
hufstedler.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
includes
laws,
and
laws
are
the
business
of
lawyers,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i...
i
read
the
court's
opinion
as
i
thought
you
did,
to
say
that
the
california
state
bar
can...
can
lobby
about
any
law
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
done
more
than
create
a
state
agency
which
is
usually
staffed
by
people
who
volunteer
to
staff
it.
it's
created
the
agency
and
impressed
every
lawyer
in
california
into...
into
service
as
a
member
of
it.
now,
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--seems
to
me.
that's
only
partly
right,
your
honor.
it
has
made
every
member
a
member
of
the
state
bar
and
require
that
they
pay
a
fee
in
order
to
practice
law.
it
has
not
impressed
them
into
service.
that's
the
important
thing.
as
a
lawyer
in
california,
i
don't
have
to
do
thing
one
for
the
state
bar.
you
have
to
be
a
member
of
the
state
bar.
you
have
to
be
a
member
of
that
agency
that
you
were
just
talking
about,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
means
two
things.
you
have
to
support
its
activities,
including
its
speech,
with
your
money,
and
it
means,
secondly,
that
you
have
to
be
associated
with
that
agency
of
which
you're
a
member.
so
that
somebody
can
come
up
to
you
and
say,
hey,
i
see
that
your...
your
bar
association
just
endorsed
a
nuclear
freeze.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
have
any
control
over
those
guys?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
administration
of
justice
in
any...
in
any
sense
that
lawyers
are
expert
about.
i
mean,
whether
you
should...
you
should
provide
that
offense
for
someone
who
uses
an
armor-piercing
bullet
or
not,
you
either
think
yes
or
you
think
no.
i
don't
know...
what...
does
it
have
to
do
with
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
or...
it
seems
to
me
imminently
a
political
issue
having
very
little
to
do
with
the
expertise
of
lawyers.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
has
to
be
a
line
somewhere.
do
you
think
a
state
can
create
an
agency
with
the
use
of
general...
general
funds
that
it
charges
with
the
mission
of
lobbying
for...
on
particular
referendum
issues?
it's
the
state's
referendum
lobbying
agency,
and
it
goes
out
and
advertises
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--speaks
to
the
public
on
referendums.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
i'm
sort
of
asking
you
that.
do
you
think
it
meets
the
constitutional
requirements
of
this
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
not
partisan
campaigns
but...
but
on
any...
on
any
issue--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
it's
armor-piercing
bullets
or
capital
punishment
or
abortion,
or
whatnot,
tax
funds
are
going
to
fund
this
agency
which
intervenes
in
the...
in
the
political
process
by...
by
lobbying
with
legislators
and
by
campaigning
with
the
public.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
your...
your
compelling
interest
analysis.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
just
pick
a
general
goal
like
administration
or
justice
or
labor
peace
and
that
that's
the
compelling
interest.
it
seems
to
me
you
look
to
see
whether
you
need
an
organization
such
as
a
labor
union
in
order
to
conduct
collective
bargaining.
you
obviously
do.
that
is
the
compelling
interest,
the
compelling
need
for
that
kind
of
an
organization.
and
i
suppose
the
appropriate
question
here
is
do
you
need
this
kind
of
a
compulsory
association
in
order
to
improve
the
administrative...
the
administration
of
justice
instead
of
relying
upon
voluntary
organization?
at
least
for
some...
for
some
areas.
now,
perhaps
you
do
for
disbarment
and...
and
things
of
that
sort,
policing
the
ethics
of
the
profession.
but
for
recommendations
on
laws,
do
you
need
this
kind
of
an
association
as
opposed
to
the
numerous
voluntary
bar
associations
that
exist
throughout
the
country?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's...
that's
a
much
different
questions,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
would
you
apply
some
test
that
if
there
is
a
voluntary
association
of
lawyers
that's
willing
to
provide
the...
the
analysis
or
the
advice
there's...
there's
prima
facia
no
compelling
state
interest
in
impressing
every
lawyer
in
the
state
to
supporting
such
an
enterprise?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
saying
delegating.
i'm
saying
whenever
you
have
a
voluntary
association
of
lawyers
that
has
come
forward
and
said
these
are
our
comments
on
the
rules
of
civil
procedure,
whatever
they
are,
you
prima
facia
don't
need
a
mandatory
state
association
of
lawyers
to
do
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
do
you
need
a
mandatory
association
of
all
the
state
lawyers
for?
for
discipline
matters?
for
what?
