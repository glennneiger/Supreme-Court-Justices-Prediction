chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-1905,
eddie
keller
v.
the
state
bar
of
california.
mr.
caso,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
have
to
start
kind
of
building
the
wheel
from
scratch
every...
every
question
you
get
to
with
respect
to
the
state
bar?
couldn't
one
say
there
is
sufficient
reason
to...
for
california
to
require
an
integrated
bar
in
the
interest
of
attorney...
to
start
out
with,
in
the
interest
of
maintaining
attorney
discipline
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
couldn't
you
say
some
of
these
things
are
at
least
offshoots
of
the
need
to
regulate
the
practice
of...
regulate
the
practice
of
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do...
but
do
you
think
the
lathrop
decision
that
a
state
may
integrate
its
bar
is
based
on
a
compelling
necessity
for
integrating
the
state
bar?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
neither
lathrop
or
abood,
which
is
certainly
a
related
case
on
the
other
side,
uses
that
term?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
caso,
in
our
abood
decision,
which
dealt
with
teachers,
and
a
couple
of
other
decisions
dealing
with,
i
believe,
other...
other
union
members,
it
seems
to
me
the
ground
upon
which
objection
was
made
by
the
dissidents
was
not
that
they
were
tarred
with
the
brush
approved
by
the
majority
but
that
their
money
was
being
taken
to
express
views
with
which
they
didn't
agree.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
insofar
as
you're
talking
about
speech
here
you
subscribe
to
the
arguments
made
by...
made
by
the
people
similarly
situated
in...
in
abood
and
hudson?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
caso.
mr.
hufstedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this...
this
is
their
reply
brief,
mr.
hufstedler?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
take
the
position
then,
mr.
hufstedler,
that
the
state
bar
is
precisely
the
equivalent
of,
say,
the
corporate
city
of
sacramento
or
the
city
of
san
diego,
which
i
presume
could
take
positions
on
almost
anything
they
wanted
to
without
violating
the
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
supposing
that
the
california
statute
authorizing
the
state
bar
had
said
in
effect
you...
you
may
lobby
and
so
forth
to
the
same
extent
that
the
city
or
state
may
lobby
and
may
take
positions,
would
you...
would
you
think
that
the
constitution
might
raise
any
problems
treating
the
state
bar
that
way?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
hufstedler,
what
if
in
the
same
general
area
there
were
a
referendum
in
california
to
abolish
capital
punishment
as
it
is
provided
in
whatever
section
it
is
of
the
california
criminal
code.
now,
may
the
bar
constitutionally
and
statutorily
take
a
position
on
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
the
governor
of
california
may
go
from
place
to
place
in
the
state
and
take
positions
on
just
one
side
of
issues
and
certainly
no
one
can
challenge
the
fact
that
the
state
may
be
paying
for
his
trips.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hufstedler.
mr.
caso,
you
have
11
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
caso.
the
case
is
submitted.
