justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
they
lobby
for
a
pro
bono
requirement
for
all
attorneys
in
the
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that...
take
this...
take
this
case.
suppose
that
you
prevail
on...
on
your
theory,
could
the
bar
association
lobby
the
legislature
for
a
requirement
that
all
lawyers
in
the
state
of
california
devote
30
hours
a
year
for
pro
bono
work?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
then
you're
saying
there's
a
compelling
state
interest
that
the
bar
association
must
lobby
on
qualifications
for
law
schools?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
principal
argument
seems
to
be
that
a
lawyer
who
disagrees
with
the
position
is
going
to
be
somehow
branded
in
the
community
for
having
views
that
he
or
she
doesn't
really
espouse.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
i
am
unimpressed
by
that
argument.
everybody
knows
that
lawyers
don't
agree
on
very
much.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
claims
to
be...
it
claims
to
be
the
members
of
the
majority
or
the
board
of
governors.
whatever.
that's
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
does
a
nuclear
freeze
or
the
abortion
controversy...
does
that
raise
a
constitutional
problem?
let's
assume
that
the
statute
was
not
written
to
confine
the
bar
to
the
administration
of
justice,
so
the
bar
may
lobby
on
matters
in
the
public
interest.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
there
be
a
constitutional
problem?
i
mean,
i
take
it
what's
before
us
is...
is
really
a
constitutional
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
you're...
if
you're
trying
to
say
that
we
needn't
be
concerned
because
a
number
of
these
issues
won't
arise,
that's
one
thing.
but
in
order
to
test
the
constitutional
theory,
what's
your
answer
about
the
nuclear
freeze
and
the
abortion
controversy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
can't
imagine
anything
that's
more
germane
to
the
administration
of
justice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i...
but
the
message
you
want
to
leave
us
with
is
that
constitutionally
even
if
the
state
bar
could
and
did
take
an
issue
on
that
there's
no
constitutional
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's...
that's
why
this
whole
government
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
may
cut
against
you.
it
seems
to
me
that
you
may
have
a
harder
case
because
you're
a
governmental
agency--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--for
that
very
reason,
that
the
lawyer
can't
get
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
the
bar
does
have
certain
immunities
and
powers
that
make
it
even
more
potent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
with
this
do-good
agency
that
can
lobby
on
any
issue,
could
only
the
lawyers
be
compelled
to
pay
dues
to
that
to
support
its
activities?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
you
could
make--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--a
very
rational
argument...
a
lot
of
people
could...
that
nothing
is
more
important
to
morality
and
to
continued
law
than
a
nuclear
freeze.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
are
we
supposed
to
judge
whether
or
not
each
of
these
issues
on
an
issue-by-issue
basis
is
somehow
compelling?
