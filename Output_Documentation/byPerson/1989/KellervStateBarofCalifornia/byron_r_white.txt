justice
byron
r.
white
may
they
lobby
on
any
subject
permissibly
against
the
views
of
some
minority?
justice
byron
r.
white
so...
so
your
answer
to
my
question
is
that
they
can...
they
can
lobby
for
nothing
unless
there's
a
compelling
interest
for
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
bar
wouldn't
have
to
do
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
authorize
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what...
what
did
the
court
below
say
the
bar
was
authorized
to
do?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
it
said
that
they
can
lobby
on
any
kind
of
a
law
before
the
legislature?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
is
the
conference
of
delegates
financed
by
the
bar
dues?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
they
couldn't,
though,
it
wouldn't
be
a
speech
or
association
issue,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
something
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if...
what
if
we
agree
with
you,
what
will
our
judgment
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
the
state
has
an
interest
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
state
obviously
thinks
it
has
an
interest
in
all
these
things.
but
you
think--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
think
there...
we
would
have
to...
we
would
have
to
say
there
may
be
an
integrated
bar
but
only
for
certain
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
not...
not--
justice
byron
r.
white
--not
the
administration
of
justice?
justice
byron
r.
white
i...
i
don't
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
improving
the
quality...
the
delivery
of
legal
services
mean?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think...
do
you
think
the
reform...
that
reformation
of
the
tort...
law
of
torts
would
be
improving
the
delivery
of
legal
services?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't...
i
thought
you
were...
you
wanted...
you
were
asking
perhaps
an
injunction
against
the
bar
from
doing
those
things.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
get
a...
if
we
agree
with
you,
you
don't...
you're
not...
wouldn't...
would
it
solve
your
problem
to...
to
have
a
little
refund
of
dues
or
do
you
want
an
injunction
against
the
bar
from
doing
these
things
as
long
as
they
have
an
integrated
bar?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
going
to
do
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
isn't
going
to
satisfy
you
to...
to
have
the...
the
kind
of
a
solution
that
there
is
in
the
labor
union
area?
