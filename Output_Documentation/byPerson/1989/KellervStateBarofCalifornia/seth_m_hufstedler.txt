mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
one
of
the
first
questions
of
the
court
dealt
with
what
it
is
that
we
have
left
in
this
case,
and
i
must
say
that
i
have
had
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
trying
to
determine
what
the
petitioners'
position
is
on
that
from
the
beginning.
i
should
tell
you,
first
of
all,
that
in
all
the
formal
pleadings
in
this
case,
the
complaints,
the
attempt
to
get
a
preliminary
injunction
against
the
state
bar,
the
motion
for
a
partial
summary
judgment,
all
asked
that
the
state
bar
be
prevented
from
doing
these
things,
from
using
its
name
in
any
way
in
any
legislative
activity,
from
ever
appearing
before
the
legislature
as
a
state
bar
on
any
issue
and
ever
advising
any
member
of
the
public
of
its
position
on
any
legislative
matter.
that
was
the
injunction
they
sought
to
obtain
and
that's
what
their
complaint
asks.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no,
justice
stevens,
they
didn't,
and
so
far
as
i
can
determine,
until
today,
other
than
saying
hudson
should
control
here,
they
have
never
said,
we
really
ought
to--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--oh,
no.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no,
your
honor.
you're
quite
right,
that's
what
it
says,
but
that's
not...
they
didn't
ask
that
they
be
reimbursed.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
they
asked
that
the
members
of
the
board
of
governors
of
the
state
bar
repay
the
state
bar
for
the
expenditures
that
had
taken
place.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
they
didn't
ever
ask
that
they,
as
members
of
the
bar,
be
repaid
for
a
share
of
their
dues.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no,
your
honor.
i
wouldn't
urge
that
question;
i
don't
think
so.
i'm
simply
trying
to
define
what
i
think
it
is
that
they
have
asked
for
and
how
i
think
unreasonable
some
of
their
demands
have
been.
now,
let's
come
down
to
the
present
day,
and
for
the
first
time...
the
first
time...
on
the
last
page
of
their
closing
brief
they
tell
us
now
presumably
what
we're
talking
about.
and
they
say
their
position
is
not
that
they
object
to
the
bar
advising
the
governor--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--this
is
their
reply
brief,
page
12...
11
and
12,
actually,
the
conclusion,
the
very
last...
the
next
two
pages
and
the
last
paragraph.
if
you'll
look
at
the
conclusion,
for
example,
they
say
they
don't
challenge
the
bar's
power
to
appoint
a
member
of
the
law
revision
commission.
it's
all
right
for
the
bar
to
get
involved
in
changing
the
laws
and
improving
the
laws.
they
don't
even
object
to
the
bar
advising
the
governor
on
the
qualification
of
judicial
appointees.
what
could
be
a
more
political
or
ideological
approach
than
speech
to
the
governor
about
what
the
bar
thinks
about
judicial
appointees?
nor,
now,
do
they
say,
for
the
first
time...
all
of
these
are
for
the
first
time--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--oh,
i...
certainly,
that's
quite
right.
and
i
must
say
that's
a
perfectly
legitimate
inquiry
into
almost
anything
we
talk
about
here
today
because
the
entire
record
is
almost
all
in
generic
terms
and
so
we
have
that
problem
as
we
go
along.
but
if
you
look
at
the
last
page
at
the
top,
they
say,
"instead,
it
is
the
bar's
political
and
ideological
advocacy.
"
now,
i
think
this
court
has
already
said
that
political
in
this
context
doesn't
mean
much.
whether
you're
looking
at
the
language
in
lathrop
or
whether
you're
looking
at
the
language
in
abood,
those
don't
any
longer
add
anything
to
what
we're
talking
about.
what
they're
talking
is
legislative
advocacy.
and
they
say,
"instead,
it
is
the
bar's
political
and
ideological
advocacy,
unrelated
to
the
regulation
of
the
practice
of
law
or
the
improvement
of
the
judicial
system.
"
for
the
first
time
now
we
have
a
concession
that
the
bar
can
do
those
things
with
regard
to
the
regulation
of
the
profession,
the
practice
of
the
law.
furthermore,
not
just
in
that
area,
which
was
the
area
primarily
dealt
with
in
lathrop,
but
with
regard
to
improvement
in
the
judicial
system.
now,
it
is
our
position
that
the
state
bar
is
entitled
to
take
positions,
legislatively
and
otherwise,
on
matters
affecting
the
judicial
system
or,
more
broadly,
in
the
words
of
the
statute
of
california,
which
authorized
the
state
bar,
to
act
in
the
aid
of
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
quite
agree,
your
honor.
we...
you're
correct,
we
do
not
take
that
position.
to
the
contrary,
as
indicated,
we
have
statutory
authorization,
and
it
is
to
act,
as
i've
indicated,
in
the
areas
of
administration
of
justice,
advancing
the
science
of
jurisprudence,
period.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
don't
think
so,
but
i
think
there's
an
intermediate
question
that
has
to
be
asked
and
that's
what's
the
state
bar
authorized
to
do.
the
state
bar
is
only
authorized
to
do
what
i
said.
it's
not
authorized
to
act
outside
the
scope
of--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--to
pursue
the
administration
of
justice.
actually,
your
honor,
the
statement
is
really
quite
clear.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
no.
it
did
say
that
laws
are
the
business
of
lawyers
and
that
they
may
have
expertise
to
help
with
respect
to
that.
but
the
overall
view,
as
stated
in
the
first
paragraph
when
the
court
determines
what
they're
going
to
talk
about
and
what
they're
going
to
hold,
and
they
say...
and
this
is
the
first
paragraph
of
justice
broussard's
opinion.
upon
analysis,
et
cetera,
"we
conclude
that
the
state
bar
may
use
dues
to
finance
any
activity
except
the
election
campaigning
which
is
germane
to
its
statutory
mission
to
promote.
"
--quote...
"the
improvement
of
the
administration
of
justice.
"
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it
does
indeed.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
i
would...
i'd
have
to
say
now...
really,
perhaps,
i'm
only
quibbling
with
that,
your
honor.
if,
for
example,
the
state
bar
did
what
the
aba
did
and
what
was
cited
as
a
horrible
example
here
to
you
today...
if
the
board
of
governors
said,
we
want
to
go
out
and
support
any
position
with
respect
to
abortion,
i
don't
think
that
per
se
is
included
within
the
administration
of
justice.
or
let's
take
a
more
concrete
example
because
this
one
is
in
the
record,
it's
the
one
area
where
the
complaint
is
made
that
the
state
bar
has
done
something
it
shouldn't
do,
and
it's
an
area
i
would
say
to
you
that
probably
is
not
within
the
administration
of
justice.
so,
we
can
start
with
those
propositions.
the
conference
of
delegates
in
california
adopted
a
resolution
favoring
nuclear
freeze.
now,
in
my
view,
that's
not
an
area
of
the
administration
of
justice.
it
might
involve
some
kind
of
a
statute,
but
i
think
under
the
statutes
of
california
the
state
bar
is
not
authorized
to
lobby
on
that
proposition.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
certainly
that
would
be
in
the
public
interest
and
the
lawyers
might
have
some
expertise
on
some
particular
grounds.
let's
take--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--yes,
all
right.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
all
right,
i
am
saying
the
former,
and
let
me
address
the
latter.
with
regard
to
the
constitutional
question,
it
seems
to
me
the
issues
are
clear.
this
court
has
laid
them
down.
first
of
all,
so
far
as
a
state
government
in
its
activities
is
concerned,
it
must
have
a
legitimate
state
goal
in
order
to
adopt
a
program
that
it
wants
to
go
forward
with.
the
first
test
this
court
has
said
is
is
this
a
legitimate
government
interest.
now,
let
me
say
to
you
here
in
answer
to
your
question,
as
the
briefs
say
and
despite
the
contrary
claim
that
we
haven't
made
it
clear.
we
have
identified
from
the
beginning
that
the
interest
we're
talking
about
is
the
interest
in
the
advancement
of
the
administration
of
justice.
now,
the
first
question
is,
is
that
a
legitimate
state
goal?
it
seems
to
me
no
one
can
have
any
doubt.
not
only
the
advancement
of
the
administration
of
justice
is
a
legitimate
goal,
not
only
is
it
an
important
goal...
and
although
i...
i
would
dispute
the
fact
that
any
of
these
cases
require
that
it
be
compelling,
i
can't
think
of
a
more
compelling
interest
than
advancing
the
interest
in
the
administration
of
justice.
so,
the
first
question
is
is
the
administration
of
justice
an
important
governmental
interest
that
qualifies?
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
is
yes.
now,
the
second
constitutional
question,
as
i
understand
it,
that
this
court
has
laid
down
is,
all
right,
if
the
legislature
has
adopted
that
goal,
have
they
adopted
reasonable
means
in
order
to
pursue
it?
here
they
have
adopted
a
state
bar
act,
they
have
created
a
state
bar
as
a
governmental
agency
to
carry
out
the
state
purpose
of
bringing
the
lawyers'
expertise
to
be
available
both
to
the
public
generally
and
to
the
legislature
on
the
questions
of
the
administration
of
justice.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--well,
that's
only--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--all
right.
and
let's
talk
about
what
that
means.
that
means
i
have
to
pay
dues,
period.
i
don't
have
to
do
another
single
thing.
i
don't
have
to
go
to
a
meeting.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it's
true
i
have
to
follow--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--all...
all
true.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
all
true
with
a
couple
exceptions.
certainly
they
are
members
and
certainly
they
pay,
and
there
is
no
other
obligation.
now,
you
included
in
your
question,
and
i
can
understand
why,
the
observation
that,
well,
your
bar
just
endorsed
a
nuclear
freeze.
and
that's
the
other
point
i
want
to
talk
about...
on
the
nuclear
freeze,
as
an
example.
the
bar
didn't
endorse
a
nuclear
freeze.
it's
very
important
to
understand
what
the
conference
does
and
why
it
is
important
in
california.
in
connection
with
the
annual
meeting
of
the
lawyers
in
california,
the
state
bar
has
a
conference
of
delegates
to
which
any
bar
association
can
send
delegates,
and
in
fact,
any
ten
lawyers
in
the
state
can
get
together
and
send
a
delegate
if
they
wish
to
do
so.
there
they
discuss
primarily
the
nuts
and
bolts
of
practicing
law.
in
the
record
you
have
the
information
for
the
year
1982.
there
were
181
resolutions;
39
of
them
dealt
with
the
code
of
civil
procedure
and
the
evidence
code.
the
nuts
and
bolts.
but
in
the
course
of
that
somebody
put
in
a
resolution
that
the
state
bar
should
endorse
the
nuclear
freeze.
the
conference
discussed
it,
passed
the
resolution.
the
conference
has
no
binding
authority
on
anyone.
free
speech.
the
members
of
the
association
can
come
together
and
talk
and
you
can
hear
what
these
people
say
and
exchange
their
ideas.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it
is
indeed,
your
honor.
it
is
indeed.
but
the
point
is
the
state
bar
took
no
action
whatsoever
on
that.
the
state
bar--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
and
let
me
tell
you
about
armor-piercing
bullets.
yes,
indeed,
there
was
some
discussion
and
there
was
some
lobbying
with
respect
to
armor-piercing
bullets.
and
why?
that
statute
redefined
the
definition
of
first-degree
murder
and
created
a
first-degree
murder
claim
in
california
if
somebody
were
murdered
with
an
armor-piercing
bullet.
now,
that's
the
sort
of
thing
that
relates
directly
to
the
administration
of
justice,
the
definition
of
first-degree
murder,
and
that's
what
lawyers
talked
about
so
far
as
the
as
the
bullet--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--of
course
they
could.
no
doubt
about
that.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
when
you
deal
with
the
section
in
california
which
deals
with
the
various
elements
of
first-degree
murder
and
what
is
required
that
that's
something
that
lawyers
not
only
have
a
great
deal
of
expertise
in
that
they
can
assist
with,
but
it
also
could
very
well
affect
the
volume
of
cases
in
california,
the
trial
calendars
and
various
other
procedural
matters.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
my
view
would
be
no,
that...
again,
it
depends.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
certainly
for
somebody
who
is
charged
with
it,
i
think
that's
quite
right.
but
let
me...
let
me...
let
me
sort
these
out
just
a
bit,
because
i
think
the
armor-piercing
bullet
case
is
an
example.
each
of
these
things
have
various
kinds
of
elements
that
do
go
directly
to
the
administration
of
justice
and
they
have
various
underlying
policy
elements.
now,
if
the
question
put
before
the
state
bar
was
should
there
be
capital
punishment
or
should
there
not
be
capital
punishment,
i
suggest
to
you
that's
not
a
matter
of
administration
of
justice.
that's
an
underlying
policy
matter
and,
therefore,
the
state
bar
should
stay
out
of
that,
as
indeed
they
have.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
that's
true.
with
this
exception
and
this
qualification.
one
would
have
to
decide
that
if
the
state
bar...
let's
suppose
the
state
legislature
passed
a
statute
and
said,
state
bar,
you
go
out
and
formulate
a
position
on
capital
punishment
and
report
it
to
the
legislature.
suppose
they
did
that.
now,
if
they
did
that,
i
would
have
no
doubt
of
its
constitutionality
because,
one,
the
state
has
a
perfectly
legitimate
interest
in
determining
what
the
views
are
of
people
who
have
knowledge
in
that
area,
and
this
is
a
rational
way
of
having
that
information
collected
and
made
available...
it
need
not
be
exclusive.
and,
therefore,
i
would
say
that's
constitutional.
i
would
say
the
state
bar
doesn't
do
it
not
because
there's
a
constitutional--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--all
right.
it
certainly
is.
and
the
answer
to
that...
my
answer
to
that
would
be
yes,
justice
stevens,
and
let
me
tell
you
why.
and
each
time
you
come
back
to
what
is
really
the
very
important
question
here
and
the
crux.
these
people
are
required
to
pay
dues
to
the
state
bar,
and
if
they
are
required
to
pay
dues,
shouldn't
we
act
as
though
this
were
a
private
organization
and
they
have...
because
their
dues
are
being
used
some
way
they
don't
want
to
they
ought
to
have
some
kind
of
relief.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no
for
two
reasons,
both
of
which
it
seems
to
me
give
you
a
complete
answer
here.
the
first
is
that
this
is
a
state
agency,
and
it's
a
legitimate,
genuine
state
agency.
i
can--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--well--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--i--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--i
don't
defend
that
position.
i
really
don't
think
that's
what
the
state...
what
the
court
there
intended
to
say
in
any
event.
i
think
what
the
court
said
is
this
is
a
state
agency.
clearly
the
constitution's
first
amendment
applies
to
the
state,
the
federal
government.
that's
what
it
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
do.
but
the
point
is
that
when
the
state
imposes
a
tax...
let
me
use
the
word
tax
for
the
moment...
upon
each
lawyer
for
the
right
to
practice
law
in
california,
it
now
has
a
tax
which
it
can
use
for
any
legitimate,
authorized
purpose.
and
if
that
purpose
is
a
constitutional
purpose,
we
don't
then
have
the
negative
first
amendment
rights
applicable
to
the
activity
of
a
government
agency.
now,
that's
the
first
ground
and
that's
why
the
california
supreme
court
talked
about
that
question.
this
is
a
state--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--no,
you're
certainly
right
about
that.
it's
not
on
the--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--yes,
it
is
a
standing
question.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
i
think
this
will
be
the
question
that
decides
that
issue
probably.
certainly,
the
california
court
said
no.
but
to
answer
your
question,
yes,
i
think
in
broad
terms
it's
a
standing
question.
but
let
me
state
it
a
little
bit
broader.
i
think
the
view
is
that
our
social
contract
is
that
you
can't
demit,
you
can't
secede
from
a
government
institution.
probably
the
best...
the
clearest
case
that
has
come
down
from
this
court
is
united
states
against
lee
where
the
amish
being
required
to
pay
taxes
in
violation
of
their
religious
views
for
social
security.
i
think--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--well--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--there
are
some--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--well,
there
are
certainly
some
drawbacks
to
being
a
government
agency.
for
example,
we
can't
campaign,
we
can't
contribute
to
candidates.
if
we
weren't
a
government
agency,
of
course
we
could
do
that
sort
of
thing.
we
would
have
a
first
amendment
right
and
we
could
do
so.
so,
there
are
some
disadvantages.
but
as
a
government
institution...
you
remember,
i'm
sure,
what
harlan
said
in
lathrop.
he
thought
it
was
beyond
any
doubt
that
the
government
could
charge
lawyers
a
fee
for
practicing
law
and
he
thought
there
was
no
question
they
could
use
those
fees
to
set
up
a
law
revision
commission
or
some
such
institution
to
comment
on
the
change
of
laws.
and
that's
essentially
the
argument,
that
this
is
a
tax;
you
can't
demit
from
the
payment
of
the
tax
even
though
you
disagree
with
it.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
of
course,
you're
asking--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--a
basic
constitutional
problem.
my
answer
would
have
to
be
to
you,
if
it
meets
the
constitutional
requirements
of
this
court,
yes,
it
could.
but
it
would
have
to
meet
those
requirements--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--i
would
think
you'd
have
to
know
what
it
was
about.
if
you
established
a...
an
agency
which
was
to
campaign
on
any
issue
that
came
along--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--well,
let
me
broaden--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--well,
let
me...
let
me
broaden
the
question
just
a
bit
and
then
narrow
it
back
to
your
question.
if
the
state
should
come
up
with
an
agency
which
said
on
every
issue
which
comes
up
before
the
public
we
want
you
to
examine
it,
examine
what
the
issues
are
on
both
sides,
and
publish
what
those
issues
and
analyses
are
so
the
voters
can
view
them,
i
would
say,
yes,
no
doubt
about
it
at
all.
now,
if
the
state
bar
said...
or,
if
the
state
said,
we're
going
to
pass
a
statute
and
you're
going
to
go
out
and
pick
one
side
of
every
issue
and
then
go
out
and
campaign
only
for
that
side,
i
would
have
serious
doubts
that
that
was
a
legitimate
public
issue
and
would
pass
original
constitutional
muster
for
a
legitimate
government
purpose.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
absolutely
certain
that
elected
officials
can
do
so
and
can
endorse
any
issue
they
wish
to
do
so,
and
that's
paid
for
by
taxes
and
you
can't
demit,
you
can't
refuse
to
pay
taxes
or
get
part
of
it
back
because
somebody
did.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
well,
i
would
suppose
it
would
have
to
have
a
fairly
close
relationship
to
lawyers.
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
without
being
confiscatory
the
state
can
impose
a
tax
upon
lawyers
for
the
right
to
practice
law
and
then
use
those
funds
however
it
sees
fit
for
any
legitimate
purpose.
i
think--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--no,
it
wouldn't
be
at
all.
it
wouldn't
be
at
all.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
i
think
that's
right.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
you're
quite
right
and
i
do
want
to
tell
you
the
state
answer,
and
i
appreciate
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
under
the
abood,
the
labor
union-type
cases,
which
is
the
basic
authority
that's
relied
on
here
by
the
petitioners,
it
seems
to
us
that
you
reach
the
same
result.
and
let
me
see
if
i
can't
say
it
in
four
or
five
sentences
and
then
to
the
extent
we
need
to
discuss
it
further
we
can.
but
the
abood
and
their...
and
its
progeny
are
quite
clear,
that
the
first
thing
you
look
at
is
what
is
the
government
interest
that
justifies
compelling
membership
in
the
labor
union.
and
in
the
labor
union
cases
it's
collective
bargaining
and
labor
peace,
and
that's
clear.
and
the
test
is
not
a
compelling
interest
test
but
quite
clearly
is
the
activity
germane
then
to
collective
bargaining.
and
if
it
is
germane,
the
compelled
duties
may
be
used
for
it.
now,
let's
move
over
to
the
state
bar.
the
labor
union
analogy
per
se
clearly
doesn't
fit.
the
state
bar
does
nothing
by
way
of
collective
bargaining,
and
yet
that's
the
sole
ground
that
justifies
dues
there.
so
you
have
to
kind
of
throw
that
out
and
look
back
a
step
in
more
general
principles.
what's
the
purpose
of
the
state
bar?
now,
the
california
constitution,
the
california
supreme
court,
the
california
statutes
make
that
clear.
it
is
to
aid
in
the
administration
of
justice,
and
that
includes
regulation
of
the
profession.
now,
i
suggest
to
you
that
those
duties,
those
interests,
the
regulation
of
the
profession,
the
advancement
of
the
administration
of
justice,
are
every
bit
as
compelling
as
labor
peace,
and
those
are
the
interests
which
correspond
to
collective
bargaining
which
justify
bringing
all
of
the
lawyers
together
in
a
compulsory
association.
the
association
portion
has
long
since
been
established
in
lathrop
and
we're
dealing
now
with
the
dues
side
of
it.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
therefore,
the
compelling
interest...
i'll
be
through
with
this
in
just
a
moment.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
the
compelling
interest
that
permits
us
to
go
forward
here,
or
the
important
interest,
is
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
regulation
of
the
profession
and,
therefore,
under
exactly
the
same
parallel
reasoning,
so
long
as
these
activities
are
germane
to
the
administration
of
justice,
the
compelled
dues
are
appropriate.
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
let...
let
me--
mr.
seth
m.
hufstedler
--it
is
a
much
different
question,
and
i
suggest
it's
not
a
question
that
the
cases
would
support.
i
don't
believe
any
of
these
cases
say,
is
this
the
exclusive
way
or
is
this
the
need.
i
think
it
talks
about
compelling
interest
in
the
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
interest,
not
the
fact
that
it
is
an
exclusive
interest
or
that
it
can't
be
done
any
other
way.
let
me
conclude
because
my
time
obviously
is
about
out,
and
i'd
like
to
conclude
with
this
thought.
the
state
of
california
has
set
up
an
integrated
bar
association
for
the
purpose
of
getting
certain
advantages
in
the
state.
and
those
advantages
are
to
get
the
common
collective
view
of
lawyers
on
these
various
interests
that
they
have
undertaken,
the
advancement
of
the
administration
of
justice
and
the
regulation
of
the
profession.
now,
i
suggest
to
you
that
it
is
appropriate
to
let
the
state
of
california
set
up
its
own
government
regulatory
body
and
to
impose
taxes,
impose
dues,
whatever
the
label
is,
upon
the
lawyers
to
support
that
organization
as
a
matter
of
taxes
and
to
accomplish
a
legitimate,
important,
indeed,
if
necessary,
even
compelling
state
interest:
the
advancement
of
the
administration
of
justice.
that's
why
we
believe
this
is
ultimately
important.
and
i
would
conclude
with
the
final
thought
that
if
you
look
at
the
amount
of
money
the
state
bar
spends
for
these
few
items
of
lobbying
that
the
complaint
is
made
about
here,
you'll
find
it's
a
tiny
fraction
of
1
percent,
because
seven-eights
of
the
budget,
as
the
record
shows,
goes
for
regulation
of
the
profession
and
discipline...
two-thirds
go
to
discipline
alone...
and
that
only
a
tiny
portion
deals
with
these
very
few
instances
that
have
been
suggested,
all
of
which
in
our
view
are
entirely
justified.
