justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
does
abood
speak
in
terms
of
a
justification
by
a
compelling
state
interest
in
every
case,
or
does
it
talk
about
germaneness
to
the
purpose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
rely
on
abood?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
exactly
what
do
we
have
before
us
here?
what
are
the
activities
of
the
bar
that
are
left
in
this
case
that
are
now
before
us
that
we
have
to
apply
this
test
to?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
did
the
courts
below
say
it
would
be
all
right
for
the
bar
to
support
political
candidates
as
well
and
make
contributions
to
them?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under...
the
under
the
ruling
below,
is
the
state
bar
free
to
give
endorsements
to
judicial
candidates
on
retention
elections?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
even
if
abood
applies
here,
wouldn't
you
say
that
a
good
many
of
the
state
bar's
ideological
activities
and
positions
are
germane
to
its
purpose
in
the...
advancing
the
administration
of
justice
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
just
asking
you
whether
that
wouldn't
meet
the
abood
test
of
germaneness,
at
least
as
we
have
articulated
it
in
that
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
although
nothing
in
our
cases,
in
lathrop
or
abood,
says
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
talk
about
that
for
a
minute.
the
court
below
seemed
to
go
off
on
the
theory
that
because
it's
a
state
agency
the
first
amendment
is
inapplicable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
that
was
a
little
curious.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
defend
that
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i...
i'm
not
sure.
is
it
a
function
of...
of
the
standing
doctrine
that
doesn't
let
taxpayers
come
in
and
challenge
these
things?
it
isn't
that
the
first
amendment
doesn't
apply,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
a
standing
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
suppose
members
of
the
state
bar
have
been
recognized
as
having
standing
to
challenge
what
the
state
bar
does
with
their
dues.
