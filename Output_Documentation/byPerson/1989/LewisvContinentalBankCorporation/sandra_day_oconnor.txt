justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
in
cases
like
that
granite
rock
case
from
california,
there
was
no
absolute
assurance
that
the
mining
interests
were
going
to
continue.
they
just
said
well,
if
economic
conditions
are
such
that
we
can,
we
would
like
to
continue.
and
that
is
very
much
like
the
kind
of
allegation
the
bank
is
making
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
their
statement
was
pretty
much
to
the
effect
that
they
do
intend
to
file
for
this
uninsured
permit
or
license,
provided
the
economic
circumstances
justify
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
we,
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
discriminatory
effect,
do
we
look
at
the
statute
independently
of
the
douglas
amendment,
or
in
tandem
with
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
do
you
get
around
that
lewis
case
against--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--bt--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--investment
which
held
that
plugging
a
loophole
in
the
douglas
amendment
violated
the
commerce
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
were
satisfied
that
without
such
insurance
that
it
would
be
absurd,
as
a
practical
matter,
to
even
consider
opening
it,
do
we
take
that
into
account
in
determining
whether
this
case
is
moot?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
gordon,
could
florida
just
say,
have
said,
as
an
initial
proposition,
we
are
not
going
to
have
isbs
in
florida.
period.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
sure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
effect
that
is
what
they
are
saying
now.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
can,
how
do
you
have
a
right
to
compel
them
to
charter
a
certain
kind
of
corporation?
