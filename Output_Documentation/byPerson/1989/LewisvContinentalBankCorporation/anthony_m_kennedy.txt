justice
kennedy
but
suppose
the
statute
said
in
its
preamble,
in
order
to
prevent
states
from
outside
the,
banks
from
outside
the
southeast
region,
from
establishing
isbs
in
the
state
of
florida,
and
to
protect
the
existing
competitive
environment
within
the
state
of
florida,
we
hereby
enact
the
following.
any,
any
difference
in
that
case?
justice
kennedy
well,
answer
my
question.
suppose
that
were
in
the
preamble.
would
the
case
be
the
same?
justice
kennedy
well,
that
wasn't
a
commerce
clause
case.
that
was
an
equal
protection
case.
justice
kennedy
well,
in
that
respect,
do
you
challenge
the
constitutional
validity
of
658.74
and
664.07,
which
say
that
only
a
bank
or
an
isb
may
provide
these
banking
services?
i
mean,
isn't
that
really
what
causes
the
discrimination
that
concerns
you
here?
justice
kennedy
well,
but...
but
given
the
florida
scheme,
wouldn't
it
make
just
as
much
sense
for
you
to
be
attacking
as
unconstitutional
because
of
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause,
the
florida
provisions
which
say
that
only
a
bank
can
engage
in
certain
kinds
of
services?
i
mean,
that
is
really
the
nub
of
the
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
that
florida
could
permit
these
banking
services
to
be
rendered
by
non-bank
institutions
if
it
chose,
quite
without
regard
to
the
federal
legislation.
or
am
i
incorrect
about
that?
justice
kennedy
well,
why
isn't
that
the
unconstitutional
statute
here,
rather
than
the
statute
which
concerns
chartering
of
isbs?
justice
kennedy
well,
you
want
to
engage
in
banking
services.
that's...
you
don't
want
an
isb,
you
don't
care
really
about
an
isb.
you
want
to
engage
in
these
ancillary
banking
services.
isn't
that
the
point?
justice
kennedy
but
it
isn't
congress.
it
is
the
florida
statute
which
says
that
only
a
bank
can
offer
these
services.
that
is
the
only
reason
you
want
the
isb.
so,
isn't
that
really
the
causative
statute
which
denies
you
the
right
to
engage
in
business
that
you
choose,
that
you
are
seeking?
justice
kennedy
did
you
cite
alternate
bases
for
the
award
of
attorneys
fees
on
your
request
to
the
court
of
appeals?
