mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
start
with
that.
first
of
all,
what
the
department
is
doing
here
is
raising
two
separate
mootness
claims.
one
is
a
claim
that
we
have
some
sort
of
compulsion
to
update
our
application.
there
is
a
second
mootness
claim
that
has
to
do
with
the
present
inability
to
obtain
fdic
insurance.
and
there
is
sort
of
a
pea
and
shell
game
going
on
here
between
those
two
mootness
claims,
and
what
i
would
like
to
do
is
address
the
two
of
them
separately.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
what
we
agree
is
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--the
application
speaks
for
itself.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
well,
if
we
are
going
to
be--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--if
we
are
going
to
be
technical--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--i
would
disagree
with
that.
if
we
are
going
to
be
technical,
what
the
application
states
is
that
we
will
seek
fdic
insurance
to
the
extent
permitted
by
law.
in
this
particular
case,
as
a
result,
you
know,
nine
years
later,
the
extent
is
no
extent.
so,
being
technical,
we
are
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
fdic
insurance.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
which
should
indicate
that
the
fdic
will
ever
grant
insurance
for
an
entity
that
would
thereby
become
illegal.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
we
would
ever
apply--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--what
i
think
is
really
going
on
here
is
that
this
is
an
application
that
was
filed
nine
years
ago,
and
circumstances
have
changed.
and
i
really
would
address
mr.
scalia's
comment
or
question
about
our
ability
to
simply
independently
file
a
declaratory
judgment.
let
me
first,
let
me
just
specifically
address
the
lack
of
insurance.
we
have
unequivocally
stated
in
our
brief,
page
20
of
our
brief,
that
we
do
not
believe
that
the
lack
of
fdic
insurance
is
any
obstacle
here
to
our
application.
we
believe
that
we
can
go
forward
and
have
a
profitable,
successful
industrial
savings
bank
without
fdic
insurance.
what
we
have
as
support,
obviously
there
is
no
direct
record
support
here
since
this
is
an
issue
which
arose
after
the
trial
court,
we
cited
to
the
court
statistics
showing
that
there
are
hundreds
and
hundreds
and
billions
of
dollars
of
uninsured
deposits
in
this
country.
mr.
wilmarth
referred
to
special
circumstances
regarding
continental
bank
that,
because
of
continental's
status
that
it
would
be
unable
to
have
uninsured
deposits.
continental
has
an
edge
act
bank.
edge
act
banks,
under
federal
law,
are
not
permitted
to
have
fdic
insurance.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
that's--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--justice,
that
is
the
second
part
of
what
i
am
wanting
to
address
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
we
have
not
filed
another
application.
since
1984
florida
law
has
prohibited
us
from
filing
an
application,
or
prohibited
the
grant
of
an
application.
i
suppose
we
could
have
put
one
in
the
mail,
and
it
would
have
just
been
sent
back.
there
is,
this
application
proceeding
has
been
stayed
on
motion
by
the
department
since
1982.
we
are
representing
here
that
we
intend
to
go
forward
with
our
isb
application.
continental
has
a
present
intention
to
go
forward
with
isb
applications.
continental
actually
is
considering
going
in
more
than
one
location
in
florida.
the
reservation
that
we
have
stated
in
our
brief
is
limited
to
solely
the
following
circumstance,
that
we
cannot
predict
what
the
case
will
be
six
months
from
now,
nine
months
from
now,
two
years
from
now.
the
department
is
seeking
remand
for
further
factual
development--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--that
is
correct.
we,
at
the
present
time,
know
of
no
consideration
that
would
preclude
us
from
going
forward.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
under
florida
law,
what
is
required
in
an
application
is
a
whole
series
of
different
items.
for
example,
we
have
to
precisely
designate
the
location
of
the
facility.
we
have
to
include
a
copy
of
the
lease.
we
have
to
enter
into
that
lease,
or
have
a
lease
option.
i
submit,
for
example,
that
mootness
does
not
require
us
for
nine
years
to
pay
rent
solely
to
keep
a
live
application.
under
the
application
procedure
we
have
to
designate
who
our
officers
are
going
to
be.
they
have
to
be
kept
available,
as
soon
as
the
application
is
approved,
to
go
in
and
open
the
business.
that
is
an
obvious
impossibility
here
with
this
kind
of
litigation
that
lasts
this
long
amount
of
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
that
was
all
done
in
the
current
application.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
well,
it's
just
nine
years
later,
and
there
are
changes.
we
can
amend,
but
i
guess
what
i
am
saying
is
that
there
is
also
a
substantial
amount
of
that
application
that
is
time
sensitive.
in
other
words,
that
application,
within
six
months
or
nine
months
or
a
year
of
being
amended,
would
itself
become
stale.
people
leave
the
bank,
there
would
be
new
officers,
we
end
up
going
to
a
different
location.
what
the
department
essentially
is
saying
here
is
that
we
have
the
obligation
once
a
year
to
update
our
application.
and
what
our
contention
is
is
that
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
that
has
ever
required
that
for
nine
years
we
have
to
continue
to
maintain
a
current
application
to
test
the
validity
of
an
absolute
prohibition
against
going
in--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--we
would
be
happy
to
submit
an
affidavit.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
no,
no,
sir.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
justice,
the
litigation
here
was
not
directed
at
the
contents
of
the
application.
they
simply
refused
to
accept
our
application.
so
there
is
nothing
in
our
complaint
that
isn't
still
applicable.
what
we
are
seeking
here
is
simply
the
right
to
have
them
accept
our
application
for
processing.
the
contents
of
the
application,
in
a
technical
way,
are
really
irrelevant
to
the
right
that
continental
is
seeking
to
obtain
here,
and
that
is
to
have
an
application
by
an
out-of-state
bank
holding
company
considered
on
the
merits,
irrespective
of
the
location
or
the
headquarters
of
the
applicant.
and
that--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--or
we
in
some
other
way
demonstrated
our
intention
to
go
forward.
because
what
we
have
here
is
an
absolute
prohibition
by
state
law
against
the
issuance
of
a
charter.
and
what
we
are
seeking
to
do
here
is
obtain
the
right
to
go
forward
in
the
face
of
that
absolute
prohibition.
the
mootness
issue
here
obviously
is
essential
to
our
case.
and
if
there
are
any
questions
regarding
the
nature
of
continental's
intentions,
you
know,
i
would
be
happy
and
be
pleased
to
expand
on
what
i
have
just
said.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
justice
scalia,
this
issue--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--this
issue
arose
in
the
court
of
appeals
after
complete
briefing
and
argument,
i
guess
about
a
week
before
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
and
we
prevailed
both,
we
prevailed
both--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
correct.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
essentially,
yes,
sir.
but,
again,
just
so
that
the
record
is
completely
clear,
any
reservation
that
we
are
making
here
is
simply
the
reservation
that
we
made
as
a
matter
of
common
sense
by
any
business
that
is
going
to
be
asked
to
spend
an
awful
lot
of
money
to
put
together
an
application,
invest
millions
of
dollars
in
banks
in
more
than
one
location,
at
an
unknown
point
in
the
future.
we,
i
submit,
meet
every
criteria
of
the
test
that
this
court
looked
at
in
granite
rock.
it's
not
dissimilar
to
the
kind
of
thing
that
was
in
super
tire,
where
there
were
employers
who
were
going
to
face
a
future
problem
with
unemployment
compensation
in
labor
law.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
for
reasons
that
are
unknown
at
this
time.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
yes,
sir.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
yes,
sir.
we
simply...
the
things
that
we
can
check
include
the
lack
of
fdic
insurance.
fdic
insurance
is
something
that
we,
continental
can
talk
to
its
marketing
people,
and
is
able
to
determine,
to
the
extent
that
it
can
do
so
at
the
present
time,
that
fdic
insurance
is
not
a
problem.
fdic
insurance
is
not
what
is
causing
any
reservation
by
continental.
that
we
are
saying
unequivocally,
also.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
justice,
the
additional
point
i
think
that
i
would
like
to
note
here
is
that
there
is
an
application
procedure.
and
that
application
procedure
is
to
determine
whether
the
proposed
applicant
has
a
reasonable
promise
of
successful
operation.
that
is
the
statutory
criteria.
the
application
process
itself
will
decide
whether
we
can
operate.
and
that
is
what
we
are
seeking
to
have.
we
are
seeking
to
have
an
application
process
that
is
free
of
the
discrimination
which
has
existed
now
for
nine
years.
let
me
turn
to
the
commerce
clause
issue.
this
court
repeatedly
has
held
that
discriminatory
motive
or
discriminatory
effect
is
sufficient
to
invalidate
protectionist
state
action.
i
would
cite
to
the
court
both
the
bacchus
case
and
the
minnesota
versus
clover
leaf
creamery.
mr.
wilmarth--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--the
court's
decisions
can
be
read
to
say
that.
i
think
in
this
case
we
have
both
effect
and
intent.
but,
let
me
just
begin
at
least
with
intent.
in
clover
leaf
creamery,
this
court
said,
in
finding
that
there
was
no
discriminatory
intent,
that
it
was
going
to
rely
on
the
statements
of
the
legislature.
and
what
we
have
here
is
a
flat
statement
by
the
legislature
that
this
statute
was
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
depriving
continental
of
an
effective
means
of
gaining
access
to
florida
deposits.
that
is
the
quote
from
the
legislative
history.
there
is
no
doubt
here
as
to
the
motive
of
the
legislature.
there
is
a
history
here
that
goes
back
17
years
as
to
the
motive
of
the
legislature.
in
1980,
in
the
lewis
case,
this
court
held
unconstitutional
florida's
prohibitions
against
the
acquisition
of
non-banking
subsidiaries
by
out-of-state
bank
holding
companies.
the
florida
legislature,
three
weeks
later,
reenacted
the
statute,
verbatim.
the
acts
of
the
florida
legislature
here
are
nothing
more
than
acts
of
defiance
of
this
court.
the
legislature
further,
when
we
received
a
preliminary
injunction
in
this
case,
proceeded
to
impose
a
moratorium.
after
the
moratorium
expired
and
we
received
summary
judgment,
the
department
came
up
with
an
administrative
policy.
their
administrative
policy
was
that
continental
had
to
act
as
a
"bank"
under
the
bank
holding
company
act,
and
thus
be
barred
under
the
douglas
amendment.
that
administrative
policy
itself
was
illegal
under
florida's
very
strict
adherence
to
the
doctrine
of
improper
delegation
of
legislative
authority.
the
florida
apa
follows
that
very
strictly,
much
more
so
than
the
federal
apa.
it
further
had
a
problem,
the
department's
policy,
because
we
took
the
deposition
of
the
director
of
the
division
of
banking.
he
didn't
know
this
policy
existed.
we
finally
showed
him
the
pleading
filed
in
this
case
to
show
that
the
policy
existed.
he
was
unable
to
say
when
it
was
formed.
he
was
unable
to
say
what
its
scope
was.
he
was
unable
to
give
any
details
regarding
how
this
policy
came
into
being,
how
it
operated,
or
how
it
would
effect
continental.
following
that
deposition,
which
i
submit
made
it
fairly
clear
to
all
the
parties
that
this
administrative
policy
wasn't
going
to
prevent
continental
from
going
forward,
is
when
the
florida
legislature
enacted
the
1984
statute
which
is
being
challenged
here,
which
completely
barred
any
out-of-state...
excuse
me,
which
completely
barred
any
isb
chartering
authority
in
the
future.
that
statute,
as
the
court
has
noted,
grandfathered
the
existing
florida
isbs.
it
further
had
its,
unlike
the
rest
of
the
banking
legislation,
had
its
effective
date
accelerated.
it,
as
i
said
earlier,
in
its
legislative
history
makes
clear
that
it
was
expressly
directed
at
continental's
application,
and
was
enacted
because
continental
obtained
summary
judgment
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
no.
they
grandfathered
the
existing
isbs.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
there
were
a
number
of
applications
pending,
and
those
applications
by
out-of-state
bank
holding
companies
effectively
were
cut
off.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
no--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--yes,
sir.
i
may
have
been
imprecise
in
some
language.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
the
department
has
offered
them
bank
charters
and
they
apparently
have
all
accepted.
in
addition
to
motive,
which
i
submit
here
is,
the
record
is
overwhelming,
despite
the
denials
by
the
department,
the
effects
here
are
also
plain.
what
we
have
here
is
an
absolute
prohibition
against
engaging
in
business.
this
court
has
never
required,
in
circumstances
of
an
absolute
prohibition,
that
there
be
some
specific
record
evidence
of
an
effect,
for
the
reason
that
it
is
impossible
to
show
effect
when
there
is
a
complete
prohibition
against
engaging
in
the
interstate
commerce.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
no,
sir.
the...
we
have
two
areas
here.
we
have
the
section
3(d),
as
to
which
congress
has
authorized
discrimination.
we
have
section
4(c)(8)
subsidiaries
as
to
which
congress
has
not
authorized
subsidiary...
excuse
me,
have
not
authorized
discrimination,
as
this
court
held
in
lewis,
in
lewis
one.
there
are
all
sorts
of
different
kinds
of
section
4(c)(8)
subsidiaries
which
engage
in
many
of
the
same
activities
that
section
3(d)
banks
engage
in.
but
this
is
what
congress
decided.
this
was
the
line
that
congress
drew.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
it...
there
is
probably
no
shortage
of
florida
statutes
that
are
unconstitutional,
or
that
could
be
attacked
from
the
constitutional
basis.
so
long,
though,
as
the
entity
is
a
section
3(d)
entity,
we
have
no
complaint.
congress
has
drawn
that
line.
and
congress,
instead
of
drawing
the
line,
you
know,
in
terms
of
a
market,
has
drawn
the
line
in
terms
of
a
particular
corporate
structure.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
florida
certainly
would
have
freedom
to
have
financial
services
delivered
in
any
number
of
ways.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
well,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
justice.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
well,
but
congress
has
drawn
a
line,
and
we...
you
know,
congress's
power
over
interstate
commerce
is
plenary,
and
it
has
drawn
the
line
as
to
section
3(d)
banks.
and
so
long
as
the
statute
is
applicable--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--justice,
i
suppose
that
we
could
have
a
argument
in
a
particular
factual
context,
which
i
don't
know
that
we
have
here,
where
a
statute
of
that
sort
might
be
unconstitutional,
if
it
had
the
purpose
and
effect
of
discriminating
against
interstate
commerce.
i
am
not
sure
that
the
florida
statute,
as
presently
written,
there
either
could
be
a
factual
record
that
could
support
that,
or,
you
know,
that
there
would
be
those
sorts
of
effects.
let
me
turn
to
the...
let
me,
i
guess,
give
one
more
response
there.
i
think
that
what
the
department
is
trying
to
do
here
is
to
take
the
aura
of
section
3(d)
and
transport
it,
or
transpose
it,
into
other
kinds
of
activities
that
are
section
4(c)(8).
and
what
they
have
done
is
take
the
same
argument
that
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
lewis,
and
dressed
it
up
in
different
clothes
in
this
case.
in
lewis,
what,
in
the
first
lewis
case,
what
the
department
tried
to
say
was
that
section
3(d),
by
its
nature,
in
order
to
be
effective,
constituted
congressional
authorization
for
discrimination
as
to
section
4(c)(8).
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
before
all
this
came
up?
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
certainly.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
well,
the
distinction--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--there
are
a
number
of
responses.
first
of
all,
there
is
just
a
right
way
to
do
things
and
a
wrong
way
to
do
things.
and
what
the
state
has
done
here
is
act
with
discriminatory
intent
and
discriminatory
effect.
and
that
is
what
the
constitution
prohibits.
they
could,
on
a
different
record,
they
might
be
able
to
do
entirely
the
same
thing.
the...
justice
holmes
once
remarked
that
even
a
dog
can
distinguish
between
being
stumbled
over
and
being
kicked.
there
is
a
difference
between
when
there
is
a
discriminatory
motive,
and
when
it
is
being
done
for
appropriate,
proper,
regulatory
reasons.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
well,
this
court--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--the
normal
presumption
is
that
statutes
will
have
the
effects
intended
by
the
legislature.
so
looking
to
discriminatory
motive,
and
finding
that
sufficient,
is
simply
another
way
of
saying
that
this
court
will
assume
that
legislation
will
have
the
effects
that
are
intended
by
the
legislature.
and
that,
i
submit,
is
an
appropriate
way
to
protect
the
interests
in
national
union,
which
are
the
foundation--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--well,
bacchus
and
minnesota
versus
clover
leaf
creamery.
they
both...
minnesota
says
that.
bacchus
is
more
along
those
lines.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
what?
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
there
is
at
least
language
in
both
decisions
that
lend
themselves
to
that.
certainly
there
has
been
many
suggestions
that
discriminatory
motive,
discriminatory
intent,
is
the
focus
of
this
court's
commerce
clause
doctrine
and
juris
prudence.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
well,
the
state
has
announced--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--well--
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
--it
turns
on
whether,
you
know,
we
assume
that
legislatures
are
competent,
and
that
legislation
will
have
the
effects
that
they
desire.
and
this
legislation
certainly
has
had
the
effect
of
keeping
out-of-state
bank
holding
companies
out
of
the
state
of
florida
now
for,
as
to
this
particular
issue,
for
nine
years.
let
me
turn,
finally,
to
the
attorneys
fee
issue.
first
of
all,
as
we
set
forth
in
our
brief,
there
is,
at
least
in
this
record,
a
substantial
basis
to
assume
that
attorneys
fees
were
imposed
as
sanctions.
there
is
obviously
complete
silence
on
the
part
of
the
eleventh
circuit
as
to
why
they
imposed
attorneys
fees,
but
there
is
more
than
enough,
particularly
in
a
situation
where
the
state
does
not
even
bother
responding
to
a
motion
for
attorneys
fees,
to
assume
that
attorneys
fees
here
are
proper.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
yes,
sir.
justice
kennedy,
my
feeling
that
this
is
an
award
for
sanctions
basically
relates
to
events
at
oral
argument,
where
the
eleventh
circuit
expressed
its
displeasure
with
the
litigation.
there
is
nothing
in
particular
in
the
record
that
shows
just
what
it
is
that
the
eleventh
circuit
was
doing.
but
turning
to
the
core
1983
issue,
1988
issue,
our
position,
very
briefly,
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
which
has
sufficient
clarity
to
restrict
the
plain
statutory
language
in
1983.
1983
provides
a
cause
of
action
for
any
deprivation
of
any
right,
privilege
or
immunity.
that
language
is
as
broad
as
congress
could
imagine.
it
is,
the
language
itself
is
broader
than
the
language
contained
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
fourteenth
amendment
contains
no
reference
to
rights,
solely
to
privileges
and
immunities.
the
legislative
history
has
been
exhaustively
analyzed
by
this
court.
i
don't
think
i
need
to
go
through
it,
but
this
court,
in
a
number
of
decisions,
has
made
clear
that
there
is
nothing
in
that
legislative
history
that
justifies
extending
less
than
all
of
the
rights
conferred
by
the
constitution
on
litigants
in
federal
courts.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
no,
sir.
i
didn't
mean
to
in
any
way
qualify
what
i
said.
mr.
andrew
l.
gordon
right.
as
to
that
issue,
the
bank
presently
can
evaluate,
presumably
there
is
not
going
to
be
a
lot
of
difference
between
the
inability
to
have
insurance
now
and
the
inability
to
have
insurance
a
year
from
now,
or
two
years
from
now.
it
is
a
number
of
other
economic
possibilities
that
you
just,
you
can't
predict
what
is
going
to
happen.
