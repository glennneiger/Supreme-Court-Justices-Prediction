justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wilmarth,
suppose
instead
of
filing
an
application
for
a
particular
bank,
as
they
had
done,
the
plaintiffs
here
had
brought
a,
simply
brought
a
declaratory
judgment
action
prior
to
filing
that
application,
it
being
clear
that
the
application
would
be
denied
under
the
law
in
question,
and
asserted
that
the
law
in
question
was
unconstitutional?
would
that
declaratory
judgment
action
properly
lie?
justice
scalia
but
at
the
time
they
did
not
have
the
right
to
protect
their
regional
banking
scheme
from,
from
isbs.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that,
that
may
be
a
valid
argument,
but
it
seems
to
me
it
doesn't
respond
to
justice
kennedy's
point,
that
the
motivation
was
perfectly
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're,
you're...
because
the
motivation
wasn't
perfectly
okay
if
they
did
not
have
a
right
to
preserve
their
regional,
their
regional
system,
against
a
particular
type
of
bank.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
didn't,
but
didn't
allow
them
to
insulate
it
against
one
type
of
bank,
which
may
have
been
a
mistake,
but
that
was
the
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
are
saying
that
their
motivation
was
we
want
to
insulate
it
even
against
this
kind
of
bank.
and,
now
maybe
what
they
did
was
objectively
okay,
but
that's
a
different
question.
we
are
just
talking
about
whether
the
motivation
is
on
its
face
a
thoroughly
federally
justified
motivation.
i
suggest
it
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
a
good
argument
against
the
dormant
commerce
clause,
but
that
argument
has
been
made
and
lost.
we,
for
many
years,
have
said
that
that
provision
not
only
confers
power
upon
congress,
but,
in
and
of
itself,
prevents
people
from,
prevents
states
from
doing
certain
things,
which
means
it,
in
and
of
itself,
gives
individuals
the
right
not
to
have
states
do
certain
things.
doesn't
that
follow?
it
seems
to
me
it
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
then
i
guess
only
the
federal
government
can
sue
when
a
state
violates
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
the
case.
private
individuals
can
sue
and
say
you
have
violated
this
allocation
of
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
have
standing
to
assert
a
right
that
is
not
yours?
isn't
that
rather
strange?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
right.
because
that
indirect
beneficiary
is
a
beneficiary
and
has
a
right.
justice
scalia
mr.
gordon,
the
issue
isn't
whether
you
can.
i
mean,
i
can
too,
but...
you
know,
establish
a
bank
without
insurance.
but
i
don't
have
standing
to
sue.
the
issue
isn't
whether
you
can,
but
whether
you
intend
to.
justice
scalia
and
all
you
have
brought
before
us
is
an
application
that
on
its
face
indicates
an
intent
to
establish
a
bank
with
the
insurance.
now,
why
do
we
have
any
special
reason
to
believe
that
this
matters
to
you
anymore,
except
for
the
attorneys
fees
that
are
at
stake
here?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand.
do
you
have
that...
have
you
done
that
for
the
current
application?
justice
scalia
so
why
can't
you
just
amend
that
provision
and
use
the
same
locations
and
the
same
facilities?
that's
what
i
don't--
justice
scalia
--yes,
but...
but,
mr.
gordon,
there
is
another
thing
that
normally
is
done
in
litigation.
you
have
said
this
in
your
brief,
in
pages
19
and
20.
have
you
filed
any
kind
of
a
formal
pleading
or
is
there
any
evidence,
anything
in
the
record
that
supports
what
you
are
saying?
justice
scalia
well,
i
am
not
asking
you
what
you
are
be
happy
to
do.
i
am
asking
you
whether
you
did
amend
your
pleadings--
justice
antonin
scalia
there
have
been
questions
on
this
for
a
long
time.
i
share
justice
stevens'
perplexity.
this
mootness
issue
didn't
just
pop
up
yesterday.
it
has
been
here
for
a
long
time,
and
it
would
have
been
very
easy
to
have
some
clear
assurance
in
the
record
that
the
bank
is
serious
about
going
into
business
here,
of
course
subject
to,
you
know,
inter...
subsequent
change
in
economic
conditions.
but
there
isn't
any
assurance
in
the
record
except,
except
an
application
that
indicates
an
intent
to
go
ahead
with
an
insured
bank.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
no
longer
possible.
justice
scalia
--mr.
wilmarth,
just
so
i
am
clear
about
it,
is
your
representation
to
this
court
that
continental
currently
proposes
to
open
a
bank?
justice
scalia
that
that
is
its
current
intention.
justice
scalia
but
simply
that
that
intention
may
change
in
the
future
because
of
economic--
justice
scalia
--okay.
but
it
is
your
representation
that
it
is
your
client's
current
intention
to
go
forward.
justice
scalia
with
an
uninsured
isb.
justice
scalia
we
probe
the
heart
of
the
states,
that
is
what
this
is
really
about.
justice
scalia
evil
states,
we
punish
them,
whether
they
do
harm
or
not.
we
want
to
stop
bad
motivations
out
there.
justice
scalia
that
doesn't
seem...
i
never
knew
we
did
that.
justice
scalia
i
have
just
one
for
you.
i
am
sorry
to
trouble
you
with
it
again,
but
i
thought
you
gave
me
a
categorical
answer
last
time,
but
then
you
went
on
to
say
the
bank
has
not
yet
considered
the
effects
of
inability
to
get
insurance
or
what
not?
justice
scalia
the
bank
has
considered
its
inability
to
get
insurance
by
reason
of
the
new
legislation,
and
nonetheless
has
made
the
determination
to
proceed
with
this
application.
