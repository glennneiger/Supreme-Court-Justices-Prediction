mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
appeal
by
gerald
a.
lewis,
comptroller
of
the
state
of
florida
and
head
of
the
florida
department
of
banking
and
finance,
from
a
decision
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
this
case
arose
out
of
an
application
filed
by
appellee
continental
bank
corporation
to
establish
a
state
chartered
industrial
savings
bank,
to
which
i
will
refer
as
an
isb,
in
miami,
florida.
the
court
of
appeals
struck
down
three
florida
statutes
which
prohibited
continental
from
opening
the
proposed
isb
based
on
the
commerce
clause.
the
court
of
appeals
also
granted
attorneys
fees
on
appeal
to
continental,
apparently
based
on
42
u.s.c.
sections
1983
and
1988.
appellant
lewis
maintains
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed
for
three
reasons.
first,
this
case
has
become
moot
by
reason
of
a
1987
amendment
to
the
federal
bank
holding
company
act.
second,
section
664.02
of
the
florida
statutes,
which
prohibits
the
issuance
of
any
further
isb
charters
to
any
person,
represents
a
non-discriminatory
exercise
of
florida's
authority
over
the
chartering
of
local
banking
institutions.
the
statute
is
therefore
lawful
under
the
commerce
clause.
and,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
the
statute
would
thereby
moot
the
case
by
precluding
any
relief
to
continental.
third,
continental's
claims
under
the
dormant
commerce
clause
do
not
vindicate
any
right
secured
by
the
constitution
that
is
cognizable
under
42
u.s.c.
1983.
accordingly,
continental
cannot
recover
attorneys
fees
under
section
1988.
i
will
first,
very
briefly,
touch
on
the
mootness
issue.
it
is
undisputed,
as
shown
by
the
briefs,
that
continental
cannot
now
open
the
isb
for
which
it
applied,
which
was
an
fdic
insured
isb.
in
1987
congress
amended
the
bank
holding
company
act
and
expanded
the
definition
of
bank
to
include
all
fdic
insured
institutions.
continental
is
an
illinois
bank
holding
company.
under
the
douglas
amendment,
continental
cannot
acquire
a
bank
in
florida,
unless
florida
gives
specific
authorization
for
illinois
bank
holding
companies
to
do
so.
again,
it
is
undisputed
that
florida
has
not
permitted
illinois
bank
holding
companies
to
acquire
banks
in
florida.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
i
do
not
believe
so,
justice
scalia,
because
there
would
have
been
both
a
standing
problem,
in
my
view,
and
perhaps
a
rightness
problem.
if
they
had
no
application
pending
under
the
statute,
or
in
fact
could
not
show
to
this
court's
satisfaction
or
the
trial
court's
satisfaction
that
they
intended
to
open
an
isb
under
the
statute,
then
obviously
it
would
be
merely
a
hypothetical,
speculative
case,
and
would
be
asking
only
for
an
advisory
opinion,
which
is
not
within
just
issuability
grounds.
and
that
is
really
the
situation
that
we
have--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--the
only
thing
that
is
left,
justice
white,
is
whether
or
not
continental
now
actually
intends
to
go
forward
and
open
an
uninsured
industrial
savings
bank.
they
cannot
open
an
fdic
insured
bank.
they
have
had
numerous
opportunities
to
do
so.
they
have
never
made
an
unequivocal,
absolute
commitment
that
they
will
apply
for
an
isb
that
is
uninsured
if
they
win
this
case.
they
have--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--i
think
we
have
said
in
our
opening
brief
that
in
our
banking
institutions
today,
less
than
one
half
of
one
percent
of
deposits
are
uninsured.
that
everyone
understands
that
federal
deposit
insurance
is--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--i
think
that
is
right,
your
honor.
in
fact,
as
we
mentioned,
continental
has
been
the
subject
of
the
largest
fdic
bailout
in
history.
it
is
highly
unlikely,
in
our
view,
that
they
could
convince
the
public,
or
would
try
to
convince
the
public,
to
put
uninsured
deposits
on
account
in
one
of
their
subsidiaries.
i
think
the
public
would
justifiably
be
very
skeptical
about
doing
so.
but
in
the
absence
of
an
unequivocal--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--i...
yes,
it
is
our
position
that
that
makes
the
case
moot,
and
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
vacated
and
remanded
on
the
grounds
of
mootness.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
i
would
like
to
distinguish
that,
if
i
could,
justice
o'connor,
because
i
thought
your
opinion
in
that
case
was
very
helpful.
you
said
that
the
mining
company
in
that
case
said
we
have
valuable
mining
claims
here,
and
we
intend
to
pursue
them,
so
long
as
that
is
economically
viable.
in
other
words,
unless
it
becomes
economically
unviable,
we
will
pursue
them.
continental
is
exactly
the
opposite.
continental
says
well,
if
we
win
this
case,
and
if
we
then
decide
that
perhaps
we
could
succeed
in
an
operation,
we
will
apply.
i
think
that
is
a
very
different
kind
of
commitment.
they
are
not
saying,
yes,
we
will
go
ahead
unless
we
find
out
later
that
it
is
just
not
viable.
they
certainly
have
not
said
that.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
yes,
that
is
in
fact
the
statement.
but
it
is
my
view
that
that
is
sort
of
saying
we
don't
absolutely
commit
at
this
time
to
go
ahead,
but
we
may
go
ahead
in
the
future
if
we
decide
that
that
is
economically
viable.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
the
application
has
been
stayed
by
the
florida
administrative
authorities
pending
this
court,
but
we
do
not
know
of
anything
that
would
have
prevented
them
from
filing
an
amended
application
if
they
had
desired
to
do
so.
i
am
not
aware
of
any
administrative
bar.
if
i
might,
i
would
then
proceed
to
the
commerce
clause
issue.
it
is
our
belief
that
section
664.02
is
entirely
non-discriminatory
both
on
its
face
and
in
its
impact.
the
statute
is
neutral
on
its
face.
it
simply
says
that
no
one
can
now
obtain
an
isb
charter,
that
comptroller
lewis
is
barred
from
granting
any
more
charters.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
found
this
was
discriminatory
but
we
should
examine
what
that
finding
was
resting
upon.
the
court
of
appeals
said
we
find
that
non-southeastern
bank
holding
companies,
that
cannot
enter
florida
under
the
douglas
amendment
and
cannot
acquire
full
service
banks,
would
wish
to
acquire
isbs
because
they
can't
acquire
full
service
banks.
we
find
that
southeastern
bank
holding
companies
probably
wouldn't
be
interested
in
opening
an
isb,
because
they
can
acquire
a
full
service
bank.
what
that
really
amounts
to
is,
they
are
saying
a
non-southeastern
bank
holding
company
cannot
acquire
a
full
service
bank.
a
southeastern
bank
holding
company
can.
but,
of
course,
that
is
the
douglas
amendment.
the
douglas
amendment
establishes
that
discrimination,
and
in
northeast
bancorp
this
court
found
that
that
discrimination
was
entirely
authorized
by
congress
under
the
commerce
clause.
section
60,
60...
i
am
sorry,
664.02,
has
no
independent
discriminatory
impact.
if
the
douglas
amendment
did
not
exist,
there
would
be
no
case,
because--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--what
i
would
say
the
test
might
be,
justice
o'connor,
is
does
this
statute
add
any
discrimination
that
does
not
already
exist
by
virtue
of
the
douglas
amendment.
it
is
our
view
that
it
does
not,
because
it
equally
withdraws
isb
charters
from
everyone.
it
does
not
add
any
discrimination,
any
differential
treatment.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
i
think--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--bt
investment.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
i
think
that
was
a
different
case
in
this
respect.
in
bt
investment,
florida
said
that
we
are
barring
only
out-of-state
bank
holding
companies
from
acquiring
investment
advisory
subsidiaries.
we
are
going
to
permit
florida
bank
holding
companies
to
continue
buying
these
things
or
establishing
them.
so
there
you
had
a
discriminatory
statute
on
its
face
and
in
its
impact,
because
they
said
we're
only
applying
this
statute
to
out-of-state
bank
holding
companies.
here,
lewis
said,
yes,
we
find,
and
the
statutory
legislative
history
on
page
31
of
the
joint
appendix
shows,
that
lewis...
i
am
sorry,
the
state
legislature,
understood
that
these
isbs
were
being
applied
for
by
bank
of
america,
citicorp,
and
continental,
for
the
very
purpose
of
circumventing
the
douglas
amendment,
for
circumventing
restrictions
on
interstate
banking.
and
the
florida
legislature
made
a
principle
decision
that
they
did
not
want
to
see
their
regional
banking
program
and
the
douglas
amendment
undermined
by
these
non-bank
banks.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
uh,
we
grandfathered
the
three
existing
isbs--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--not
any
longer,
i
would
point
out,
justice
white.
they
have
now
all
converted
into
other
types
of
institutions.
there
were
three
small
institutions.
we
would
think
this
case
is
similar
to
minnesota
versus
clover
leaf
creamery
or
new
orleans
versus
dukes.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
well,
i
would
still
take
the
same
position
that
clover
leaf
creamery
said
that
a
state
legislature
does
not
have
to
strike
at
all
evils
at
once.
that
there
the
state
legislature
decided
to
withdraw--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--well,
with
respect--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--with
respect,
i
think,
as
far
as
lewis
was
concerned,
this
was
a
very
dangerous
development,
because
this
meant
that
florida
could
no
longer
preserve
a
competitive
and
unconcentrated
banking
environment
that
would
be
responsive
to
the
needs
of
its
local
consumers
and
businesses.
and
it
is
interesting,
i
think,
in
retrospect,
that
congress
actually
agreed
with
florida
and
in
1987
plugged
the
non-bank
bank
loop-hole,
finding
that,
exactly
the
same
thing,
that
the
non-bank
banks
were
undermining
the
states'
abilities
to
choose
under
the
douglas
amendment.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
i
think
that
is
essentially,
as
i
understand
the
policies
that
are
clearly
either
stated
or
implicit
on
joint
appendix
31,
that
florida
is
saying
we
just
passed
a
regional
banking
program
last
month.
we
want
to
preserve
this
first
experimental
step
toward
full
interstate
banking.
we
don't
want
to
see
it
undermined
by
forces
outside
our
control.
congress
has
given
us
control
over
our
banking
structure,
and
so
we
are
making
a
choice
that
we
are
going
to
withdraw
this
charter
option
from
everyone,
in-state
as
well
as
out-of-state.
that
is
the
cost
of
plugging
the
loophole.
in
other
words,
florida--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--i,
i
believe
so.
i
don't
think
there,
i
think
that
would
be
the
same,
in
my
view,
that
the,
i
think
the
legislative
history,
plus
the
implied
knowledge
of
legislature,
what
they
had
done
a
month
before,
seems
to
me
to
amount
to
what
you
have
just
said.
that
we
have
decided
that
we
are
going
to
maintain
our
regional
banking
program
by
not
letting
non-southeastern
people
in
to
open
non-bank
banks,
and
we
find
that
the
reason
we
are
doing
this
is
to
preserve
a
competitive,
unconcentrated
banking
environment.
we
cited
in
our
main
brief
that
their
regional
banking
statute
had
been
based
on
very
extensive
studies
and
reports
to
the
governor
and
to
the
state
legislature.
and
those
were
the
purposes
articulated
in
those
staff
reports,
that
what
florida
is
doing
by
establishing
a
regional
banking
program
is
to
preserve
a
competitive,
unconcentrated
banking
environment,
and
to
provide
for
the
credit
needs
of
local
businesses
and
consumers.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
well,
that,
that
of
course
was
in
1984,
and
it
is
our
view
that
the
commerce
clause
did
not
prevent
them
from
taking
a
non-discriminatory
step
toward
withdrawing
the
option
from
everyone.
that
that
is
really
equivalent,
i
think,
to
what
the
maryland
legislature
did
in
exxon
corp.
versus
governor
of
maryland,
or
in
a
sense
what
minnesota
clo--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--well--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that
the
way
i
would
respond
to
that,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
douglas
amendment
did
allow
them
to
choose
a
regional
approach.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
well,
our--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--i
see.
well,
i
think
that,
to
the
extent
that
legislators
are
presumed
to
know
the
law,
one
could
certainly
presume
that
they
understood
that
the
commerce
clause
allowed
for
non-discriminatory
exercises
of
authority
over
chartering.
that
that
has
not
been...
for
example,
section
7
of
the
bank
holding
company
act
as
interpreted
in
bt
investment,
said
that
the
states
could
legitimately
enact
regulations
of
bank
holding
companies
and
subsidiaries
on
a
non-discriminatory,
even-handed
basis.
they
were
more
restrictive
than
federal
law.
and,
for
example,
there
have
been
cases
holding
that
you
can
deny
an
entire
type
of
non-banking
subsidiary
to
bank
holding
companies,
so
long
as
you
do
it
even-handedly.
that
is,
that
is
not
discrimination.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
well,
again
i
would
say
there
that
it
seems
to
me
in
two
cases,
the
clover
leaf
creamery
and
the
dukes
case,
that
you
allowed
very
limited
grandfathering,
where
you
found
that
the
limited,
the
grandfathering
of
the
paperboard,
the
pulp,
the
pulp
type
of
paperboard
milk
cartons
in
minnesota,
did
not
strike
you
as
inherently
discriminatory,
or
the
preservation
of
the
three
push
cart
vendors
in
new
orleans
did
not
strike
you
as,
inherently
as
discriminatory.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
yes,
dukes
was.
clover
leaf
creamery
was
both,
equal
protection
and
commerce
clause.
i
also
would
say
that
i
don't
understand
that
in
any
of
your
cases
you
have
found,
that
even
if
you
found
a
discriminatory
intent,
that
that
was
the
case.
that
in
all
the
cases
that
i
have
read,
for
example,
philadelphia
versus
new
jersey,
lewis
versus
bt
investment,
and
other
cases,
hunt
versus
washington
apple
advertising
commission,
where
you
thought
there
was
some
indication
of
protectionist
intent,
you
always
went
further
and
said
well,
the
main
test
is
what
is
the
impact
of
the
statute.
is
the
statute
discriminatory
in
its
impact?
and,
for
the
reasons
i
have
suggested,
this
statute
is
not
discriminatory
in
its
impact.
it
had
an
even-handed
impact
upon
both
in-state
and
out-of-state
holding
companies,
because,
apart
from
the
douglas
amendment,
there
would
be
no,
there
would
be
no
argument
of
discriminatory
treatment
here.
the
statute
itself
withdraws
the
option
equally.
if
i
might
then
proceed
at
this
time
to
the
section
1983
issue.
we
take
the
position
that
both
the
plain
language
and
the
evident
purposes
of
both
the
commerce
clause
and
the
1983
establish
that
the
claim
of
violation
of
the
dormant
commerce
clause
does
not
vindicate
any
right
secured
by
the
constitution,
which,
of
course,
is
the
predicate
for
finding
a
section
1983
remedy.
preliminarily
i
would
say
that
we
have
also
shown
that,
of
course,
1983
fees
would
not
be
available
here
unless
continental
actually
obtained
some
meaningful
relief.
and
if
you
find
the
case
to
be
moot,
based
upon
the
federal
law
change
i
have
mentioned,
or
if
you
find
it
to
be
moot
because
section
664.02
is
valid
and
therefore
prohibits
the
granting
of
the
charter,
then,
in
that
case,
continental
has
obtained
no
relief
here,
and
under
the
case
such
as
hewitt
versus
helms
and
your
garland
case
last
term,
there
would
be
no
relief,
and
therefore
no
fees.
but
going
to
the
merits
of
the
1983
issue,
the
commerce
clause
itself
does
not
guarantee
or
grant
any
rights
to
market
participants.
the
commerce
clause
says
that
congress
shall
have
power
to
regulate
commerce
among
the
states.
there
is
no
mention
of
any
rights
granting
or
rights
guaranteeing
provision
in
that
constitutional
provision.
it
is
very
different
from
other
provisions,
such
as
the
privileges--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
the
way
we
approach
the
dormant
commerce
clause
is
that
it
does
prohibit
state
discrimination
against
interstate
commerce,
but
it
does
so
as
an
allocation
of
power
between
the
federal
and
state
governments.
it
denies
to
the
states
the
power
to
discriminate.
but,
of
course,
as
you
have
recognized
in
cases
such
as
northeast
bancorp,
congress
can
restore
the
power
to
discriminate.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
well,
no,
we
take
the
position--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--yes,
we
acknowledge
that
continental
certainly
has
standing
to
complain
of
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause,
so
that
this
is
a
case
arising
under
the
federal
constitution
within
1331,
and
they
have
standing
as
a
party
aggrieved.
but
that
is
different--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--well,
i
think
in,
for
example
cases
such
as
clarke
versus
securities
industry
association,
you
have
said
that
an
indirect
beneficiary
of
a
statute,
for
example,
can
assert
a
claim,
even
though
they
are
not
the
direct
beneficiary.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
well,
again,
we
think
that
the
notion
of
right
as
used
in
1983
is
a
very,
is
a
particular
meaning
of
right.
and
that
is,
does
this
person
have
a
constitutionally
guaranteed
right
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce.
and
really,
in
four
cases
this
court
has
said
the
contrary.
that
in
clover
leaf,
exxon,
and
cts,
this
court
has
said
that
the
commerce
clause
protects
the
market.
it
does
not
protect
particular
participants
in
that
market.
that
it
protects
the
national
interest
in
having
economic
uniformity
and
an
absence
of
commercial
hostility
among
the
states.
but
it
does
not
protect
individual
participants,
because
congress,
for
example
as
in
the
glass-steagall
act,
can
entirely
prohibit
interstate
commerce,
or,
as
in
the
case
of
the
douglas
amendment,
it
can
delegate
to
the
states
the
opportunity
to
restrict
interstate
commerce.
so
this
is
not
a
right
of
the
same
kind
as
the
equal
protection
clause
or
the
due
process
clause.
i
think
it
was
put
most
strongly
in
the
metropolitan
life
insurance
case,
upon
which
continental
relies.
in
that
case
justice
powell
said
that
the
interstate...
i
am
sorry,
the
commerce
clause
and
the
equal
protection
clause
perform
different
functions.
the
commerce
clause
protects
interstate
commerce.
the
equal
protection
clause
protects
persons
from
unconstitutional
discrimination
by
the
states.
and
that
is
really
the
heart
of
our
argument.
the
clause
itself
is
not
a
grant
or
guarantee
of
any
constitutional
right
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce,
and
therefore
it
is
important
to
draw
a
distinction
between
1983,
which
says
any
right
secured
by
the
constitution,
and,
for
example,
section
1331,
which
says
any
right
arising
under
the
constitution.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
it
is
our
view
that
first
of
all
continental
would
have
to
show
that
they
have
a
constitutionally
guaranteed
right
to
engage
in
interstate
commerce.
and
that
is
certainly
contrary
to
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
they
could
bring
a
suit,
they
have
standing
to
bring
a
suit
under
the
federal
question
statute--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--well,
again,
this
would
be--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--right.
yes,
on
the
dormant
commerce
clause.
this
court's
decisions
have
given
them--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--no.
no,
it
is
our
view
that
this
court,
in
cases
since
ex
parte
young,
have
said
that
there
is
an
implied
federal
action
for
prospective
injunctive
relief
to
prevent
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
and
that,
for
example
in
hunt,
a
three
judge--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
because,
to
find
the
1983
you
must
find
that
this
is,
they
are
vindicating
their
rights
secured
by
the
constitution--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--yes.
because,
again--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--well,
that
you--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
case.
i
think
what
you
were
saying
is
the
state
has
violated
a
provision
of
the
constitution,
and
we
are
aggrieved
by
that
violation.
we
do
have
economic
interests
that
are
being
adversely
affected.
and
ex
parte
young
says--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--yes.
we
agree
that
they
are
adversely
effected.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
well,
that
he
has
a
right...
i
am
sorry.
he
has
an
entitlement
to
sue--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--under
ex
parte
young
he
only
has
prospective
injunctive
relief
against
the
state.
that,
he
also
has
attorneys
fees
under
the
hutto
versus
finney
decision,
but
he
has
nothing
more.
and
he,
of
course,
sued
lewis
in
his
official
capacity,
so
under
will
versus
michigan
he
would
not
have
damages.
lastly
i
would
say
that
the
legislative
history
of
1983
is
completely
barren
of
any
suggestion
that
commerce
clause
actions
were
to
be
included
within
this
rights
secured
by
the
constitution.
that
continental
has
shown
no
legislative
history
that
suggests
that,
and
the
one
piece
of
legislative
history,
representative
shellabarger's
comment--
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
--that
was
added
later,
you
are
right,
justice
white.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
but,
representative
shellabarger
said
there
are
two
types
of
constitutional
provisions.
there
are
those
that
allocate
powers
between
the
state
and
the
federal
government,
and
there
are
those
that
secure
particular
rights
to
individuals.
and
he
made
reference
to
the
supreme
court's
case
of
prigg
versus
pennsylvania,
which
we
may
have
referred
to,
i
am
neglecting,
in
our
brief.
but,
in
prigg
versus
pennsylvania
the
court
said
that
under
the
fugitive
slave
clause,
a
slave
holder
had
a
right
that
he
could
vindicate
under
the
constitution.
now,
shellabarger
seemed
to
draw
a
distinction
between
those
types
of
constitutionally
guaranteed
rights,
which
he
said
would
be
vindicatable
under
the
civil
rights
act
of
19...
1871,
and
the
allocation
of
powers
provisions,
which
he
certainly
implied
would
not
be
included
within
1983.
i
would
like
to
preserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
please.
mr.
arthur
e.
wilmarth,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
with
regard
to
the
assertion
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
based
attorneys
fees
on
a
sanction
for
bad
faith
conduct,
as
we
indicated
in
our
reply
brief
at
page
5,
footnote
9,
the
roadway
express
versus
piper
case
makes
clear
that
in
the
absence
of
a
finding
of
bad
faith
conduct
by
the
court
of
appeals,
or
by
the
district
court,
there
can
be
no
upholding
of
attorneys
fees
based
on
a
sanction.
and
continental
has
admitted
that
there
was
no
finding
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
bad
faith
conduct,
nor
was
there
any
finding
by
the
district
court
of
bad
faith
conduct.
in
fact,
the
district
court
denied
attorneys
fees
on
that
basis.
continental's
motion
for
attorneys
fees
was
simply
a
two
sentence
motion
which
incorporated
its
earlier
appellate
brief,
and
lewis
had
replied
to
that
appellate
brief.
so
the
motion
added
nothing,
rather
than
just
incorporating.
with
the
question
about
whether
unconstitutional
motivation
is
enough
to
strike
down
a
state
statute,
or
indeed
a
federal
statute,
i
think
there
are
two
decisions
of
this
court
that
are
relevant.
palmer
versus
thompson
in
403
u.s.
217,
which
was
an
equal
protection
case,
and
the
united
states
versus
o'brien,
391
u.s.
367,
which
was
a
first
amendment
case
involving
a
congressional
statute
about
burning
draft
cards.
and
in
both
cases
this
court
said
that
there,
it
was
disinclined
to
strike
down
a
statute
based
only
on
allegations
of
unconstitutional
motivation,
because
it
is
often
very
hard
to
determine
exactly
what
motivates
each
and
every
legislature.
so
i
think
that
those
cases
really
repudiate
the
notion
that
unconstitutional
motivation,
without
any
showing
of
unconstitutional
impact,
is
enough.
i
think
that
the
questions
of
justice
o'connor
and
justice
kennedy
indicated
what
we
have
been
expressing,
which
is
that
there
is
no
showing
that
florida
was
obliged
to
open
loopholes
in
the
douglas
amendment,
that
florida
was
somehow
constitutionally
required
to
open
loopholes
so
the
douglas
amendment
wouldn't
bite
upon
out-of-state
bank
holding
companies.
and
if
that
is
true,
and
the
united
states
indicated
that
they
agreed
with
that
position
in
their
jurisdictional
brief
at
page
17,
then
we
say
for
the
same
reason
it
can't
be
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause
for
florida
even-handedly
to
withdraw
a
chartering
option
from
everyone.
that
that
is
the
price
they
paid
for
taking
that
option
away.
lastly,
with
regard
to
the
question
of
1983
versus
the
federal
question
statute
1331,
we
have
cited
bowman
versus
chicago
and
northwestern
railway
company,
an
1885
case,
on
page
46
of
our
principal
brief.
and,
i
think
that
that
case,
when
carefully
read,
indicates
that
the
court
was
there
confronted
with
a
commerce
clause
claim,
and
the
court
found
that
that
claim
might
be
one
arising
under
the
constitution,
but
it
did
not
involve
any
right
secured
by
the
constitution.
that
was
a
case
only
ten
years
after
the
federal
question
statute
was
passed,
only
14
years
after
1983
was
passed.
so
i
think
the
court,
at
that
time,
understood
the
distinction
between
the
broad
arising
under
language
and
the
more
narrow
secured,
rights
secured
by
language.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
will
conclude
the
argument.
