justice
byron
r.
white
under
the
amended
federal
act,
what
is
left
of
this
case?
justice
white
do
you
know
if
there
are
a
lot
of
institutions
that
accept
deposits
that
aren't
insured?
justice
white
that
may
be
one
reason
there
hasn't
been
some
unequivocal
announcement.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
you
do
about
your
isbs
that
were
already
in
existence?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't,
isn't
that
a,
sort
of
a
substantial
consideration?
you
say
you
have
treated
everybody
the
same.
well,
you
haven't.
you've
got
isbs
operating
in
florida.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
if
they
hadn't
been
converted
to
some
other
type
of
institution?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
wouldn't
be
striking
at
an
evil,
it
would
be--
justice
byron
r.
white
--preserving
a,
preserving
a
local
preference.
justice
white
why
would
you
say
that
1983
doesn't
authorize
a
suit
for,
by
a
private
party,
based
on
the
commerce
clause?
justice
white
well,
why
should
it
be
able
to
bring
any
suit
at
all?
i
thought
you
said
that
they
can
bring
a
suit.
justice
white
well,
why?
why?
based
on
what?
the
commerce
clause?
justice
white
based
on
the
commerce
clause?
justice
white
you
mean
they
could,
it
wouldn't
be
subject
automatically
to
dismissal
for
failure
to
state
the
cause
of
action?
justice
white
you
mean
you
can
bring,
you
can
bring
a
federal,
you
can
say
the
federal
cause
of
action
directly
under
the
commerce
clause?
justice
white
but
you
cannot
state
one
under
a
1983.
justice
white
that
is...
and
why
not
under
a
1983?
justice
white
oh
i
know,
but
you
say
that,
if
you
just
allege,
if
you
just
proceed
under
1331,
you
can
sustain,
you
can
not
be
subject
to
automatic
dismissal.
justice
white
because
you
have
got
a
right.
justice
white
a
guaranteed
constitutional
right.
justice
white
and
that
the
plaintiff
has
been
hurt.
justice
white
the
plaintiff
has
been
hurt,
and
he
has
a
right
not
to
be
hurt.
justice
white
and
an
entitlement
to,
in
that
suit,
to
damages,
i
suppose.
or
do
you
say
he
can
only
have
injunctive
relief?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
doesn't
refer
to
statutes
specifically
either.
justice
white
it
was
not
added
in
the
statute,
it
was--
--added
in
this
court,
yes,
over
some
dissent.
justice
white
well,
you
agree
that
the
application
that
you
now
have
on
file
is
not
very
consistent
with
the
federal
law?
justice
white
that
particular
application--
justice
white
--florida
does
not
have
to
grant
that
application
under
the
present
federal
law.
justice
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
white
so
you
say,
you
say
that
your
application
really
amounts
to
an
application
to,
for
an
uninsured,
to
establish
a
bank
that
would
receive
uninsured
deposits.
justice
white
why
haven't
you
filed
an
amendment
to
your
application?
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
that
if
the
state
had
just,
when
the
federal
law
was
amended,
if
the
state
had
just
dismissed
your
application,
the
case
would
be
moot
unless
you
filed
an
amendment.
justice
white
and
you
won
on
that
issue.
justice
white
initially
it
was
not
moot.
justice
white
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
was
not
moot.
justice
white
because
they
accepted
your--
justice
white
and
they're
no
longer
in
existence
either.
justice
white
not
quite.
justice
white
not
quite.
