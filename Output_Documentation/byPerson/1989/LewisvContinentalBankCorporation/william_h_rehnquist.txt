chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
number
87-1955,
gerald
lewis
versus
continental
bank
corporation.
mr.
wilmarth,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
anything
that
has
prevented
continental
from
applying
in
the
past?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wilmarth.
mr.
gordon.
i
hope
sometime,
mr.
gordon,
you
will
tell
us
exactly
what
the
position
of
your
client
is
with
respect
to
pursuing
an
application
in
florida
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
the
case
in
the
sense
of
strictly
economic
considerations,
that
a
business
would
take
into
consideration.
chief
justice
rehnquist
discriminatory
intent,
which
has
no
adverse
impact?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
gordon,
you
say
that
the
statute,
the
florida
statute
in
1984
grandfathered
existing
florida
isbs.
were
there
any
other
isbs
that
could
have
been
grandfathered,
but
weren't?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
they
grandfathered
all
the
isbs
that
were.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
when
you
are
talking
about
grandfathering,
your
argument
could
be
read
to
suggest
that
they
grandfathered
the
florida
isbs,
but
that
there
were
others
similarly
situated
that
weren't.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
there
were
only
florida
isbs,
and
they
were
grandfathered.
is
that
what
it
amounted
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
are
saying,
in
effect,
that
a
discriminatory
motive
will
invalidate
an
enactment
which,
so
far
as
impact
is
concerned,
is
perfectly
permissible
under
the
commerce
clause?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
know,
i
mean
what
is
your
position?
and
then
tell
me,
if
you
will,
well
what
supports
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is...
what
do
you
think
is
your
best
case
from
this
court
that
says
discriminatory
intent
alone,
without
any
consideration
of
impact,
violates
the
commerce
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gordon.
mr.
wilmarth,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wilmarth.
the
case
is
submitted.
