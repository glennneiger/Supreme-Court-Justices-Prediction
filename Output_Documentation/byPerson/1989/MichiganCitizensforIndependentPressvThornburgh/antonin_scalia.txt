justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
only
difference
here
from
that
fact
that
if...
you
just
recited
is
that
it
wasn't
losing
circulation
but
it
was
losing
money
year
after
year,
was
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
consider
that
a
stable
situation,
in
which
both
newspapers
are
losing
money
every
year?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
stability?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
different,
but
maybe
i
was
jumping
ahead
of
you.
i
thought
the
reason
you
thought
it
was
different
is
that
it
indicates
in
this
situation
a
stable,
you
know,
a
stable
competitive
arrangement,
whereas
in
the
other
situations
there
was
not
a
stable
arrangement.
it...
it
seemed
to
be
deteriorating.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
it's
deteriorating
if...
if
one
paper's
losing
a
lot
of
money
every
year,
year
after
year,
despite
the
fact
that
there's
no
difference
in
circulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
that
kind
of
reasoning,
you
would
automatically
invalidate
any...
any
joa
that's
approved
by
the
justice
department
which
ends
up
in
a...
in
a
50-50
split,
i
suppose?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
usual
split?
i
don't...
i
don't
know
what
these...
how
these
things...
i
mean,
is
it...
is
it
unusual
to
have
a
50-50
split
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
all...
all
they
have
to
do
is
lose
money
for...
how
many
years
were
these
papers
losing
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
they
have
to
do
is
lose
money
for
five
years
and
gamble
on
the
fact
that
having
lost
that
many
million,
some
attorney
general
will
approve
the
joa?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
invest
in
that
paper?
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
seems
to
be
a
pretty
risky
gamble.
i...
i
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
had
a
five-year
track
record
that
seemed
to
look
just
like
that,
though,
didn't
it?
i
mean,
they're
both...
both
taking
losses
for
five
years.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
we've
applied
chevron
to
factual
determinations
by
agencies.
i
mean,
you
got
the
apa
and
normal
deference
to
that.
have
we
applied
chevron
to
that?
we're
talking
about
a
factual
determination
here,
aren't
we?
or
are
we
talking
about
an
issue
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
issue
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
a
question
of
law,
everything
is
a
question
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
precisely
what
troubles
me
about
this
decision.
i
mean,
apart
from
whether
it's
right
or
wrong,
you
begin
with
the
finding
that
this
city
will
support
two
separate
newspapers.
and
it
seems
to
me
once
you
make
that
finding,
why
would
you
ever
want
to
grant
a
joint
operating
agreement.
i
mean,
usually
you're
dealing
with
a
city
that
can't.
here
you
go
in
and
say,
this
city
can
have
two
completely
independent
newspapers,
but
since
it
can't
have
two
independent
newspapers,
we'll
grant
a
joint
operating
agreement.
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
is
"could"
mean
then.
i
don't
understand
what
"could
support"
means.
i
thought
"could
support"
meant
that
in
full
and
fair
competition,
more
than
one
would
survive.
