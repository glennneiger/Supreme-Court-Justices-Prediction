justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you,
mr.
schultz?
you
said
you
had
three
critical
facts.
one
of
them
was
that
two
papers
were
relative
equals.
what
were
the
other
two
that
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
attach
any
special
significance
to
the
fact
that
the
production
costs
of
the
news
are
higher
than
those
of
the
free
press?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
schultz,
i
may
be
wrong,
but
i
thought
it
was
knight-ridder
that
took
the
initiative
in
raising
the
prices
and
gannett
that
didn't
follow.
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
most
recent
price
increase
on
the
daily
paper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
one
of
the
papers
go
from
15
cents
to
20
cents?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
was
not
followed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
which
one
took
the
initiative
on
the
sunday
paper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
and
even
though
the
alj
had
not
credited
the
testimony
that
they
would
maintain...
that
the
news
would
maintain
the
low
price.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
your
view,
is
it
essential
to
sustain
the
attorney
general's
position
that
we
accept
the
credibility
of
the
news
executives
who
said
they
would
maintain
the
low
price
until
the
other
paper
was
driven
out
of
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
merrill,
it
is
true,
though,
that
the
attorney
general
did
accept
all
the
factual
findings
of
the
alj,
did
he
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
said
so
in
so
many
words,
didn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
supposing...
supposing
the
alj
says
i
don't
credit
the
testimony
of
witness
x,
would
you
say
we
should
accept
that
testimony
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
you
say
a
witness
is
not
telling...
i
don't
credit
a
witness,
is
that
an
inference
or
is
that
a
fact?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
testimony
of
the...
the
gannett
executive
who
says
they
will
maintain
the
low
prices
until
they
drive
the
competitor
out
of
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
just
thought
it
was
highly
improbable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
view
we
should
accept
that
testimony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
my
question.
do
you
think
we
should
accept
that
testimony
as
true,
that
the
chief
executive
of
a
large
newspaper,
which
has
been
losing
money
for
five
years,
millions
and
millions
of
dollars,
would
continue
to
lose
money
until
he
is
successful
in
driving
his
competitor
out
of
the
market?
that's
the
substance
of
what
he
testified
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
position
of
the
government
as
to
the
truth
or
falsity
of
that
testimony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
that
testimony
is
the
truth
and
if
that
program
were
carried
out
after
a
joa
were
turned
down,
would
that
be
lawful
or
unlawful
conduct
in
the
opinion
of
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'd
like
an
answer
to
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'd
like
an
answer
to
the
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
testimony
i've
just
described
is
strong
evidence
of
an
intent
to
engage
in
predatory
pricing
for
the
purpose
of
acquiring
a
monopoly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
it's
been
consistently
losing
millions
of
dollars
for
several
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
would
continue
to
lose
them
until
it
was
successful
in
driving
its
competitor
out
of
the
market.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
merrill,
isn't
it
true
that
that
finding
depends
on
an
assumption
that
the
papers
are
not
of
equal
strength,
that
the
free
press
is
already
decided
or
predestined
to
fail
if
the
two
continue
the
struggle?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
it
also
mean
that
the
reason
the
decision
of
the
news
to
keep
their
prices
low
is
a
reasonable,
rational
business
decision
is
that
they
can
predict
that
they,
by
losing
money
for
a
determinate
period
of
time
they
will
drive
the
failing
paper
out
of
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
merrill,
isn't
it
correct
that
that
finding
was
basically
saying
that
it
was
not
improper
for
them
to
consider
the
option
of
a
joa
as...
as
an
alternative
in
the
long
run?
did
he
consider
the
possibility
that
the
pricing
was
predatory
and
therefore
was
not
proper
business
behavior?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
obvious,
on
its
face,
that
there's
a
question
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
appreciate
that,
but
after
it
has
been...
been
identified
that
one
of
the
papers
will
go
out
of
business
if
you
don't
get
a
joa,
would
it
then
be
permissible
to
continue
with
that
kind
of
pricing?
you
see,
this
is...
there
are
two
different
situations.
one,
before
you
have
the
testimony
that
if
we
don't
get
our
joa,
knight-ridder
will
fold
up
the
free
press,
and
is
it
then
permissible
for
the
other
paper
to
say
well,
in
order
to
ensure
that
result,
we
will
continue
to
lose
money
for
whatever
period
of
time
it
takes
to
achieve
that
result?
do
you
think
that
raises
a
question
that
even
warrants
inquiry?
justice
john
paul
stevens
also,
there
was
then
no
statement
that
either
one
would
go
out
of
business
if
they
didn't
have
a
joa.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
unusual
in
the
post-act?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
none
of
them
had
the
dominant
paper
been
losing
money
either,
had
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say
it's
not
relevant,
but...
assuming
the
fact
were
that
the
program...
the
post-joa
denial
program
would
be
unlawful...
assume
for
the
purpose
of
argument
that
it's
unlawful
to
drive
your
competitor
out
of
business
by
selling
your
papers
below
cost
for
a
prolonged
period
of
time,
would
then...
would
it
then
be
permissible
to
grant
the
joa
because
you
can
predict
that
that's
exactly
what's
going
to
happen?
i
mean,
in
other
words,
if
the...
if
the
fail...
the
reason
for
the
failure
is
unlawful
conduct,
is
that
something
that
should
prevent
the
joa
from
being
granted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
suggesting
predatory
pricing
in
the
past,
but
the
point
would
be
that
the
only
way
in
which
the
predicted
result
would
take
place
is
if
it's
depending
on
predatory
pricing
in
the
future
when
there's
already
been
a
declaration
by
one
paper
that
i'm
not
going
to
stick
in
the
market
if
you
keep
pricing
this
way,
and
the
other
one
says
well,
i'll
continue
to
lose
money
until
i
achieve
my
goal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
consider
that
to
be
unlawful...
and
i
accept
your
point
that
you
don't
know
enough
about
costs
and
so
forth
to
draw
that
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
do--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
think
you
missed...
you
overstated
what
the
attorney
general
said.
he
didn't
say
it
was
entirely
lawful.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
primarily
the
result
of
acceptable
competitive
strategies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
expressed
no
opinion
on
the
lawfulness.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
merrill,
in
any
of
these
other
markets,
did
the...
when
they
got
down
to
two
and
a
then
one
survived,
was
it
the
afternoon
paper
that
survived
at
the
expense
of
the
morning?
isn't
this
somewhat
unusual?
