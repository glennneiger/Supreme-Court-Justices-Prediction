mr.
william
b.
schultz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
seeks
review
of
a
decision
former
attorney
general
edwin
meese
to
grant
a
joint
operating
arrangement,
or
joa,
to
the
seventh
and
eighth
largest
newspapers
in
the
country,
the
detroit
news
and
the
detroit
free
press.
the
joa
would
allow
the
papers
to
jointly
set
circulation
and
advertising
prices.
it
would
also
allow
them
to
divide
the
detroit
market
so
that
the
free
press
would
be
the
morning
paper
and
the
news
would
be
the
afternoon
paper
and
they
would
publish
a
joint
weekend
edition.
such
an
agreement
would
ordinarily
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
but
in
1970
congress
adopted
the
newspaper
preservation
act
which
gave
the
attorney
general
the
authority
to
grant
an
antitrust
exemption
to
newspapers
in
limited
circumstances.
petitioners'
challenge
is
based
on
three
arguments,
each
of
which
i
will
address.
the
first
is
that
the
joint
operating
agreement
here
is
not
consistent
with
the
purposes,
structure
and
policies
of
the
newspaper
preservation
act.
second,
the
record
here
does
not
support
the
attorney
general's
finding
that
the
free
press
was
in
probable
danger
of
financial
failure.
and
third,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
not
applying
the
rule
that
antitrust
exemptions
must
be
narrowly
construed.
before
i
get
to
those
legal
issues,
there
are
three
critical
facts
that
i
would
like
to
highlight
that
distinguish
this
case
from
every
other
joa
application.
each
of
these
facts
was
either
adopted
by
the
attorney
general
or
by
the
administrative
law
judge
whose
fact-findings
the
attorney
general
accepted,
and,
therefore,
they
are
established
facts
for
purposes
of
the
legal
issues
here.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
your
honor,
the
factual
issues
would
be
reviewed
under
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
the
legal--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--well,
and
these
are
facts
about
which
i
don't
believe
there
is
dispute.
they're
facts
that
were--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--that's
correct.
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious
or
otherwise--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--or
otherwise
not
in
violation
of
law.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
so
on
the
factual
issues
it
would
be
arbitrary
and
capricious.
on
the
legal
issues
it
would
be
whether
there's
a
violation
of
law.
the
first
of
these
critical
facts
is
that
the
newspapers
fought
the
competitive
battle
in
detroit
to
a
virtual
draw.
those
are
their
words
as
they
described
the
competitive
situation
at
the
time
they
announced
the
joa.
and
this
assessment
establishes
that
the
papers
considered
themselves
to
be
competitive
equals.
the...
free...
the
record
shows
that
the
free
press
had
been
losing
money
and
that
the
news...
the
news
had
been
losing
almost
as
much.
it
shows
that
the
daily
circulation
of
the
two
papers
was
roughly
equal,
and
in
other
areas
each
had
advantages.
the
news
was
ahead
in
advertising,
but
on
the
other
hand,
this
was
offset
by
the
fact
that
the
free
press
had
the
morning
franchise,
had
clear
dominance
in
the
morning
franchise,
which
was
considered
a
major
advantage.
and
also
important
is
the
fact
for
at
least
ten
years
there
had
been
no
movement
in
the
relative
market
position
of
these
two
papers.
this
situation,
this
whole
set
of
facts,
distinguishes
the
joa
here
from
every
one...
other
one
previously
considered
and
approved
by
the
attorney
general.
in
each
of
those
other
situations,
there
was
one
paper
that
was
dominant
and
profitable
and
a
second
paper
that
was
junior,
losing
money
and
had
been
losing
both
circulation
and
advertising.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
the
free
press
was
losing
money,
but
the
news
here
was
also
losing
almost
as
much,
whereas
in
the
other
situations
the
paper
not
designated
failing
was
profitable.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
well,
i
didn't
say--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--i
didn't
say...
i
didn't
mean
to
say
it
was
stable,
but
i'm
saying
that
they
are...
they
are
equals.
they
are
at
the
same
level,
and
that
it
hadn't
changed,
that
the
circulation
and
advertising
had
not
changed
over
ten
years.
they'd
been
fighting
for
that,
and...
and
that's
very
different
from
what
we
see--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--well,
let
me
say
in
the--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--well,
the
papers
obviously
don't
want
to
lose
money.
that's
not
a
good
thing.
but
the
question
is,
is
the
detroit
free
press
in
probable
danger
of
failing
financially?
is
it
in
probable
danger
of...
of
closing?
and
i
am
simply
saying
that
the
fact
that
they're
competitive
equals
suggests
that...
that
that's
not
the
case,
particularly
when
you
consider
the
reason
that
the
free
press
and
the
news
are
losing
money.
they're
not
losing
money
because
of
any
problem
with
the
market
in
detroit.
the
attorney
general
found
that
the
market
in
detroit
could
support
two
healthy
newspapers.
instead,
everyone
has
agreed
that
they
are
losing
money
because
their
prices
are
too
low.
the...
the
newsstand
price
for
the
detroit
news
is
15
cents.
the
newsstand
price
for
the
free
press
is
20
cents.
similarly,
advertising
prices
are
the
lowest
in
the
country.
and
so
this
is
not
a...
a
situation
as
we've
seen
in
other
cities
where,
again,
where
one's
making
money
and
one's
losing.
they're
losing
money
because
the
prices
are
too
low.
and
just
to
highlight
this,
the
fact
that
they
regarded
each
other
as
competitive
equals,
when
they
drew
up
the
joint
operating
arrangement
they
made
a
decision
to
split
profits
50-50.
this,
in
our
view,
is
further
and
very
strong
evidence
that
the
papers
regarded
themselves
as
competitively
equal.
it's
strong
evidence
that
the
news
did
not
think
that
the
free
press
was
likely
to
go
out
of
business
anytime
soon
because,
after
all,
if
it
viewed
the
free
press
as
being
likely
to
close
down
in
the
near
future,
it
would
have
made
no
sense
for
it
to
have
split
these
enormous
possible
monopoly
profits
evenly.
again,
the
profit
split
here
contrasts
dramatically
with
the
profit
split
that
was
evident
in
other
joas
approved
by
the
attorney
general.
each
one
of
those
involved
a
lopsided
profit
split,
where
the
dominant
profitable
paper
took
most
of
the
profits
and
the
junior
paper
took
a
much
smaller
percentage,
under
30
percent
in
every
case.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
i
don't
know
that
i
would
automatically
invalidate
it,
but
i
would
be
very
skeptical
of
it.
there
is
one
situation
i
can
think
of
where
it
might
be
appropriate,
and
that
would
be
the
situation
where
there
was
a
finding
that
the
market
could
support
only
one
paper,
and
also
if
there
was
a...
there
might
be
some
other
facts
that
were
different
here,
but
if
there
was
kind
of
finding
it
would
be
a
stronger
place.
but
i...
i
do
regard--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--in
terms
of
the
joas
after
1970,
which
is...
those
are
the
only
ones
that
have
been
approved
by
the
attorney
general,
the
profit
splits
have
been
between
80/20
and,
i
think,
68/32.
that's
the
range
of
the
other
joa.
so
this
is
very
unusual.
now
there
were
some
50-50
profit
splits
in
the
old
joas,
but,
of
course,
those
are
evaluated
under
a
much
different
standard,
and
they
were
entered
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
requirement
that
there
be
a
showing
that
one
of
the
newspapers
be
in
probable
danger
of...
of
financial
failure.
so,
in
the
circumstances
of
a
market
that
can
support
two
newspapers,
we
would
argue
that
where
there's
a
50-50
profit
split
and
other
evidence
that
the
papers
are
competitively
equal,
that
the
newspapers
cannot
qualify
for
approval
of
a
joint
operating
agreement.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
your
honor,
i
don't
think,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--you
want
the
papers
to
fight
hard,
but
congress
also
required
that
there
be:
(a)
a
finding
that
one
of
the
papers
is
in
probable
danger
of
financial
failure,
and
in
that
view
that
does
not
envision
fighting
to
a
draw;
and
secondly,
that
it
be
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
and
one
of
the
troubling...
one
of
the
most
troubling
aspects
of
the
joa
here
is
that
its
approval,
the
approval
of
the
joa
in
detroit,
the
one
at
issue
in
this
case,
will
result
in
a
loss
of
competition
in
other
healthy
competitive
markets
in
the
united
states,
which
would
be
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
the
newspaper
preservation
act.
after
the
statute,
there
are
three
possibilities
that
can
occur
in
competitive
newspaper
markets.
they
can
end
up
with
full
competition.
they
could
end
up
with
a
joa,
or
they
could
end
up
with
a
monopoly,
single
monopoly
paper
and
no
competition.
and
congress
clearly
set
an
order
for
those
priorities.
the
statute
expresses
the
view
that
the
most
desirable
result
would
be
a
situation
of
competition
where
the
papers
are
competing
in
terms
of
price
and
news
and
so
on.
the
second
choice
is
a
joa
which
retains
two
newspapers
but
eliminates
commercial
competition,
and
the
least
desirable
outcome
is
a
single
monopoly
paper
where
competition
is
eliminated
altogether.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
the
other
two,
when
i
got
to
them,
in
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question,
are
the
50-50
profit
split--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--which
is
the
newspaper's
own
recognition
that
they're
competitive
equals,
and
the
third
one
is
the
fact
that
the
attorney
general
found
that
the
detroit
market
can
support
two
profitable
newspapers.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
and
so
the
losses
here
are
not
caused
by
a
depression
or
problem
in
the
market.
rather,
they're
caused
by
their
prices
being
so
low.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
we
have
not.
if
anything,
i
guess
they...
they
cut
somewhat
in
our
favor,
but
the...
i
believe
that
was
noted
by
the
administrative
law
judge.
it's
not
something
we've
highlighted,
because
he
didn't
either.
the
newspaper
preservation
act
expresses
a
strong
policy
preference
for
full
competition
over
a
joa
in
several
respects.
first
of
all,
congress
adopted
a
very
narrow
definition
for
the
term
"failing
paper".
secondly,
in
the
purpose
section
of
the
statute
it
refers
to
the
interest
in
newspapers
that
are
competitive
in
all
parts
of
the
united
states,
and
then
it
explicitly
required
the
attorney
general
to
find
that
any
joa
he
approve
was
consistent
with
those
purposes.
and,
finally,
the
antitrust
rule
that
exemptions
from
the
antitrust
laws
be
narrowly
construed
has
the
effect
of
retaining
the
full
force
of
the
antitrust
laws
as
much
as
possible
where
the
exemptions
don't
apply.
therefore,
one
of
the
underlying
policies
of
the
newspaper
preservation
act
is
that
it
cannot
be
interpreted.
it
may
not
be
interpreted
in
a
way
that
will
give
incentives
in
other
markets
and
result
in
healthy
competitive
markets
being
converted
into
markets
where
newspapers
operate
under
joas
approved
by
the
attorney
general.
here
the
attorney
general's
decision
violates
that
policy
because
essentially
it
creates
a
road
map
under
which
newspapers
in
healthy
competitive
markets
can
obtain
a
joa,
and
all
they
have
to
do
under
that
decision
is
the
following.
the
first
step
is
for
one
of
the
papers
to
cut
prices
as
happened
in
detroit.
that
presumably
will
be
followed
by
a
price
cut
by
the
other
paper,
by
the
second
paper,
which
would
be
necessary
in
order
not
to
lose
circulation
in
advertising,
and
those
price
cuts
would
be
followed
by
several
years
of
losses.
that
was
precisely
the
situation
in
detroit
when
the
application
was
made.
then
the
papers
filed
their
application
for
a
joint
operating
agreement.
they
have
to
identify
one
newspaper
as
failing.
presumably
they
would
identify
the
paper
that
was
behind
in
circulation
or
advertising
or
if
one
newspaper
had
substantially
more
losses,
they
would
find
a
junior
paper.
but
if
the
papers
are
equal,
they
can
identify
either
one
under
the
attorney
general's
decision
because
that
was
the
situation
here.
accompanying
the
application
would
have
to
be
the
testimony
from
officials
of
the
paper
not
designated
as
failing
that
they
will
not
raise
their
prices
even
if
the
exemption
is
not
granted.
well,
that
testimony
should
not
be
hard
to
get,
given
the
interest
that
those
officials
have,
and
for
good
measure
they
can
add
the
testimony
from
officials
of
the
failing
paper
that
that
paper
will
close
if
the
joa
isn't
granted.
that
testimony
also
was
presented
in
the
case
of
the
detroit
application.
and,
thus,
the
risk
of
the
decision
is
that
it
will
result
in
the
artificial
generation
of
joint
operating
agreements
in
other
markets
around
the
country.
newspapers
have...
the
problem
is...
is
enhanced
by
the
fact
that
newspapers
have
a
terrific
incentive
to
try
and
obtain
approval
of
joint
operating
arrangements,
and
this
can
also
be
seen
from
the
facts
of
detroit.
in
detroit
neither
of
these
newspapers
has
ever
made
more
than
$15
million
a
year,
and
of
course
there
are
many
years
during
which
each
has
made
far
less.
yet
gannett
predicts
that
if
the
joa
is
approved,
by
the
fifth
year
the
newspapers
jointly
will
be
making
$100
million
a
year.
so,
you
can
see
that
the
profit
possibilities
are
enormous
and
thus,
if
newspapers
in...
in
other
markets
are
given
a
way
that
they
can
obtain
a
joa
through
something
as
simple
as
price
cuts--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--they
both
lost
money
for
five
years.
the--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--well--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--well--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--but...
yeah,
except...
except
what
happened
here
is
knight-ridder...
and
this
would
typically
be
the
situation...
knight-ridder's
first
choice
wasn't
a
joa.
their
first
choice
was
to
drive
the
news
out
of
business,
and
that's
what
they
hoped
to
do.
but
when
you
know
that
as
a
fall-back
you
can
get
a
joint
operating
agreement
or
that
you
have
a
good
chance
of
getting
one,
it
makes
it...
it
makes
it
much
more
likely
and...
and...
and...
and
much
more
possible.
i...
i
realize
that
it's
a
gamble--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--well,
if...
if
knight-ridder
hadn't--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--if
knight-ridder
had
not
kept
prices
so
low
in
the
'80s
that
they
were
losing
money--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--well,
what
we
say
is
that
they
should
not
be
given
a
joint
operating
agreement
here
because...
that's
right,
because
to
do
so
under
this
argument
is
going
to
jeopardize
the
situation
in
other
healthy
markets.
i
don't
believe
that
there's
likely
to
ever
be
a
stronger
case
than...
than
the
case
in
detroit,
both
because
the
papers
were
competitive
equals
and
because
of
the
enormous
evidence...
enormous
amount
of
evidence
in
the
record
in
the
form
of
memos
generated
by
the
papers
that
the
prospect
of
a
joa
was
an
important
factor
in
the
losses
the
papers
had...
had
taken.
the
papers
met
in
1981
and
in
a
memo
wrote
that...
that
the
officials
from
knight-ridder
said
a
few
more
years
with
such
losses,
and
the
prospects
of
a
joa
will
be
ironclad.
moreover,
the...
the
administrative
law
judge
found
that
in
the
mid-'80s
when
gannett
tried
to
increase
prices
so
that
both
papers
could
make
money,
knight-ridder
rebuffed
those
attempts.
knight-ridder
was
uninterested
in
doing
anything
but
losing
money
because
it
hoped
that
either
it
would
drive
the
news
out
of
the
market
or
force
the
news
into
entering
a
joa.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
not
to
foster
this
kind
of
competition.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
save
papers
that
were
failing
due
to
normal
market
sources.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
well,
given
that
the
only
way
either
of
these
papers
was...
it...
when
i
say
rebuffed,
i'm
not
saying
that
there
were
discussions,
but
given
that
the
only
way
either
of
these
papers
is
going
to
make
money
is
by
raising
prices.
they
can't
make
money
as
long
as
they
charge
15
and
20
cents
for
the
weekday
paper,
and
have
the
lowest
advertising
prices
in
the
country.
given
that,
the
fact
that
knight-ridder...
and
i'm
saying
knight-ridder
had
opportunities
to
become
profitable.
it
had
those
opportunities
because
gannett
tried
to
edge
the
prices
up.
it
didn't
take
those
opportunities,
so
given
that
it's
refused
to...
refused
the
opportunities
given
it
to
become
profitable
in
the
past,
it
shouldn't
qualify
for
a
joa
under
the
standards
of
the
statute.
there
is
also
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
administrative
law
judge
relied
on
and
quoted--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--i...
i
believe
you
are,
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
it
was
gannett...
it
wasn't
gannett,
but
it
was
gannett's
predecessor,
the
evening
news
association.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
it
was
the
news
that
tried
to
raise
prices.
i'm
talking
about
'83
and
'84.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
well,
in
terms
of
the
weekday
paper
in
detroit,
knight-ridder
hasn't...
i
don't
believe
either
of
them--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--yes,
for
the
out-of-state
papers.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
and
that
may
have
been
knight-ridder
in
that
case.
and
it...
and...
well,
there
have
been
a
number
of
price
rises.
in
terms
of
the
weekday,
i
believe
it
was
followed.
there
was
a
weekend...
a
sunday
price
rise
that
was
not
followed
immediately.
it
was
followed--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--i
believe
that
was
knight-ridder.
that
was
knight-ridder
on
the
sunday
paper.
but
this
is
now
later
in
the
'80s.
in
addition,
when
gannett
bought
the
news
association
in
1986,
it...
the
administrative
law
judge
found
that
it
had
considered
a
price
rise,
but
decided
not
to
raise
its
prices
because
that
might
make
the
free
press
profitable
and
jeopardize
the
prospects
of
the
joa.
i
only
say
this
to
say
this
is
a...
this
is
a
very
strong
case
for
this
kind
of
argument,
and
if
it
doesn't
work
here,
it's
not
likely
to
work
in
another
case.
in
addition,
on
this
record,
the
free
press
is
not
in
probable
danger
of
financial
failure.
the
attorney
general's
theory
that
it
is
goes
as
follows:
the
free
press
has
been
losing
millions
of
dollars
a
year.
this
is
due
to
low
prices.
but
the
free
press
cannot
raise
its
prices
unless
the
news
follows,
because
to
do
so
would
risk
losing
circulation
and
advertising.
and
therefore,
the
critical
question
before
the
attorney
general
was,
will
the
news
raise
its
prices
of
the
joa
was
denied?
he
found
that
the
answer
to
that
question
was
no,
even
though
a
price
rise
for
the
news
was
its
only
route
to
profitability.
and
he
made
this
finding
even
though
the
papers,
under
the
justice
department's
regulations,
have
the...
have
the
burden
of
proof
of
proving
that
the
news
won't
raise
its
prices.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
that's
correct.
even
though--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--as
a
matter
of
fact,
the...
in
making
this
finding,
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
attorney
general
relied
was
the
fact
finding
of
the
alj
where
he
explained
why
the
news
officials'
testimony
could
not
be
relied
on.
that
was...
that's
the...
that's
the
only
evidence
in
the
record
cited.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes.
absolutely.
because
that's
the
only
evidence
that
the
attorney
general
referred
to.
he...
he
simply
referred
to
news
officials
and
cited
that
portion
of
the
administrative
law
judge's
opinion.
another
problem
with
his
finding
is
that
essentially
what
the
attorney
general
is...
is
saying
is
that
the
news...
it's
rational,
and
that
the
news
will
engage
in
conduct
that
essentially
amounts
to
predatory
pricing.
the
cases
of
this
court
take
a
very
different
view,
which
is
that
firms,
in
the
long
run,
will
not
choose
to
lose
money
in
order
to
drive
a
competitor
out
of
business.
and
the
court
has
said
that
predatory
pricing
schemes
are
rarely
tried,
and
even
more
rarely
successful.
at
a
minimum,
this
places
a
heavy
burden
on
the
applicant
to
demonstrate
why
the
situation
in
detroit
should
be
different
from
the
situation
everywhere
else.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes,
justice
scalia,
they...
they
were,
but
during
those
five
years,
there
were
continual
discussions
about
the
prospects
of
a
joa,
and
the
question
has
to
be,
what
would
happen
if
they're
told
they
can't
get
a
joa
with
this
kind
of
conduct.
we
agree
that
this
conduct
may
be
rational...
it
is
rational
if
at
the
end
of
the
road
you
can
be
assured
or
even
have
a
good
chance
of
getting
a
joint
operating
arrangement.
again,
the
only
evidence
relied
on
by
the
attorney
general
was
the
testimony
of...
of
the
news,
and
that
simply
cannot
be
sufficient
under
the
applicable
standards.
i'd
like
to
say
just
a
word
about
the
chevron
issue
since
that
was
one
of
the
questions
presented.
the
panel
majority
held
that
chevron...
the
panel
majority
below
held
that
chevron
requires
so
much
deference
to
the
attorney
general
as
to
make
a
difference
in
the
outcome
of
the
case.
we
regard
that
holding
as
wrong.
at
its
heart,
chevron
is
nothing
more
than
a
way
of
determining
legislative
intent.
and
essentially
it
says
that
congress,
in
a
typical
administrative
statute,
intends
for
the
agencies
to
take
the
primary
role
in
interpreting
the
statutes.
that
presumption
can
obviously
be
overridden
by
explicit
statutory
language,
for
example,
requiring
de
novo
review.
here
it's
overridden
by
the
long-standing
rule
of
statutory
construction,
requiring
narrow...
narrow
interpretation
of
antitrust
laws;
it's
overridden
by
the
traditional
role
that
the
courts
have
taken
in
interpreting
antitrust
laws;
and
finally,
it's
overridden
by
clear
indications
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
well,
i
think
we
have
both.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
the
issue
of
law
is
whether
granting
the
joa
in
the...
in
the
undisputed
circumstances
here,
is
going
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
policies
of
the
statute
because
of
the
adverse
impact
on
otherwise
healthy
competitive
markets.
but
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
william
b.
schultz
--maybe...
i
can
answer
the
question
this
way.
because
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
say
that
even
as
a
factual
issue,
chevron
so
narrowed
its
role
that
it
wasn't
entitled
to
overrule
the
attorney
general.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
william
b.
schultz
yes.
just
three
points,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
these
various
facts
that
the
attorney
general
and
mr.
merrill
have
picked
out
of
the
record
are
all
rebutted
by
the
50-50
profit
split.
they
can't
get
away
from
the
fact
that
the
newspapers
themselves
describe
their
equal
competitive
positions
and
how
they
divided
profits.
second,
on
the
issue
of
whether
detroit
can
support
two
profitable
newspapers,
the
attorney
general
found
this
is
not
a
situation
where
one
of
these
papers
is
failing
because
it's
on
a
downward
spiral
or
losing
advertising
and
circulation.
he
didn't
find
any
of
the
situations
that
typically
accompany
a
failing
newspaper.
he
found
that
detroit
can
support
two
profitable
newspapers
if
prices
are
at
market,
so
that
focuses
the
whole
case
on
the
issue
of
price
and
nothing
else.
and
thirdly,
the
statute
has
an
explicit
requirement
that
the
attorney
general
find
that
the
joint
operating
agreement
is
consistent
with
the
policies
of
the
newspaper
preservation
act.
so
this
is
not
the
situation
of
having
so
many
cases
where
you're
arguing
about
the
agency's
policies
versus
the
court's
policies.
congress
here
identified
what
the
policies
are,
and
they
identified
the
policy
of
competition
in
all
parts
of
the
united
states,
and
the
policy
that
they
identified
is
consistent
with
the
canon
of
anti-trust
law
that
requires
that
exceptions
being
narrowly
construed.
and
if
that
canon
is
applied,
as
the
court
of
appeals
held,
then
the
attorney
general's
decision
must
be
overturned.
thank
you.
