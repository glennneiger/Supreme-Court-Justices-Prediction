chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-1640,
michigan
citizens
for
an
independent
press
v.
dick
thornburgh,
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
mr.
schultz,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schultz,
we
review
this
under
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
when
we're
talking
about
facts
are
established
by
record,
we're
not
quite
in
the
same
ball
park
as
if
you're
appealing
from
a
jury
verdict
or
findings
of
a
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
overall
standard
of
review
is
arbitrary
and
capricious,
not
supported
by
substantial
record...
evidence
considered
on
the
record
as
a
whole.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you...
you
have
a
much
greater
burden
to...
to
upset
a
determination
here
where
you're
just
under
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you...
when
you
say,
mr.
schultz,
that
one
paper
rebuffed
the
effort
of
another
paper
to
raise
prices,
i
mean,
that
isn't...
the...
had
it
not
rebuffed
it,
that
wouldn't
have
been
entirely
consistent
with
the
antitrust
laws,
would
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
schultz.
mr.
merrill,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
merrill,
you
don't
strictly
speaking
defend
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion...
at
least
insofar
as
it
relied
on
chevron,
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
answer
the
question
perhaps
and
then
clarify
your
answer.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
merrill.
mr.
schultz,
do
you
have
a
reubuttal?
you
have
two
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schultz.
the
case
is
submitted.
