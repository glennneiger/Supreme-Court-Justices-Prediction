if
we're
intending
to
ensure
some
competition
before
a
joa
agreement,
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
how
you
criticize
the
fact
that
the
knight-ridder
operation
fought
the
other
newspaper
to
a
draw.
i
think
that's
exactly
what
you
want
to
encourage.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
what's
wrong
with
each
newspaper
fighting
hard?
i
thought
that's
exactly
what
you're
supposed
to
do
before
a
joa
agreement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so...
so...
so
it
would
have...
so,
it
would
have
been
better
in
your
view
if
knight-ridder
hadn't
entered
the
market
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
view,
there's
no
chance
of
getting
into
a
joint
operating
agreement,
so
you
just
don't
compete
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's
not
the...
that's
not
the
logical
extension
of
the
principle
you're
just
arguing.
that's
another
point
altogether.
they
lost
$81
million
in
five
years,
and
you
say
that
it
would
have...
since
they
can't
get
a
joint
operating
agreement,
that
all
other
newspapers
should
be
warned
not
to
do
this.
