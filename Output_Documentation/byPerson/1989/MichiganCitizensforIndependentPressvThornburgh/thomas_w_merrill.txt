mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
schultz
started
by
giving
you
three
facts;
i'm
going
to
give
you
four
facts.
the
difference
between
my
four
facts
and
his
three
facts
are
that
mine
are
the
facts
that
the
attorney
general
relied
upon
in
making
his
decision
in
this
case
to
approve
the
joint
operating
agreement
between
the
two
newspapers.
before
i
do
that,
though,
let
me
make
two
general
remarks
about
the
nature
of
the
argument
that
you've
heard
today
and
that
petitioners
advance
in
their
briefs.
first
of
all,
the
newspaper
preservation
act
makes
it
clear
that
congress
delegated
authority
to
the
attorney
general
to
approve
or
disapprove
a
joint
operating
agreement
not
to
the
antitrust
division,
nor
to
the
administrative
law
judge.
thus,
the
decisions...
the
decision
of
the
attorney
general
and
not
the
alj,
which
is
entitled
to
deference.
and
it's
clear,
as
the
petitioners
have
conceded,
that
the
applicable
standard
of
review
is
a
highly
deferenti
one,
whether
or
not
that
decision
was
arbitrary,
capricious,
or
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i...
i
think
that
that's
not
a
fair
inference,
justice
stevens.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
he
said
that
he...
he
said
in
the
conclusion
of
his
decision,
there's
one
sentence
that
says
that
he
accepts
the
fact
findings
as
accurate,
but
that
he
has
differed
with
the
conclusions
reached
by
the
alj.
he
also
said
that
he
had
based
his
decision
on
the
review
of
the
entire
record.
he
said
that
essentially
twice.
and
in
the
body--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i
would
think
that
if
the
attorney
general
had
adopted
the
findings
of
the
alj,
that
then
perhaps
you
should
stop
with
the
alj's
findings.
but
the
attorney
general
here
never
said
i
adopt
the
findings
of...
the
administrative
law
judge.
he
said...
he
said
that
he
accepted
the
fact
findings
as
accurate,
but
differed
with
the
conclusions.
and
given
that
in
the
body
of
his
opinion,
in
the
analysis
section,
he
specifically
disagreed
with
the
administrative
law
judge
in
a
number
of
critical
junctures,
about
the
types
of
factual
determinations
that
could
be
made
on
this
record,
i
think
that
the
most
you
can
say
is
that
the...
what
the
attorney
general
was
saying...
is
that
he
accepts
the
findings
of
evidence,
but
not
necessarily
the
inferences
that
are
being
drawn
from
the
evidence.
i'll
admit
that
the
sentence
is
not
a
model
of--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--this
was...
are
you
referring
specifically
now
to
the
question
about
the
gannett--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--right.
well,
with
respect
to
that
point,
the
administrative
law
judge
said
that,
you
know,
he
did
not
give
great
credence
to
that
testimony,
not
because
he
thought
that
the...
the
witness's
demeanor
was
improper
or
that
he
had
sweaty
palms--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--whether
for
some
reason
he...
he
disagreed
with
it
basically
because
he
thought
as
a
matter
of
economic
theory
that
what
the
ceo
of
gannett
was
testifying
to
was
improbable.
and
the
attorney
general,
in
contrast,
said
that
it
was...
did
not
reflect
unsound
business
judgment
for
the
gannett
chairman
to
testify
as
he
did.
because
what
he
was
testifying
to
was
entirely
consistent
with
what
congress
had
found
to
be
the
economic
circumstances
of
the
newspaper
industry
and
what
the
record
in
the
cases
the
attorney
general
construed
it,
suggested
to
be
the
economic
condition
of
the
newspaper
industry.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
think
that
that
testimony
is
simply
one
of
several
factors
that
the
attorney
general
was
relying
upon--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i
don't...
i
do
not
think
that
the
court
either
needs
to
accept
or
not
accept
that
testimony
as
true--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--our
position
is
that
the...
the
testimony
is
entirely
consistent
with
what
this
record
in
this
case
and
what
congress
found
about
the
economics
of
the
newspaper
industry.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
claim
has
been
made
here
that
somehow
it
would
constitute
predatory
pricing.
let
me...
let
me
address
that
directly.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
hm?
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
will
try
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
this
record
about
predatory
pricing.
predatory
pricing,
i
take
it,
would
mean--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
the
testimony
is
that...
is
that
the
detroit
news
would
not
raise
its
prices--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--but...
there
is
no
suggestion--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--there
is
no
suggestion
that
the
news
is
going
to
engage
in...
in
pricing
below
marginal
cost,
pricing
below
average
variable
cost,
or
any
other
measure
of
predatory
pricing.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
about
that.
you
can't...
excuse
me...
draw
any
inferences
from
that,
from
what
the
gannett
chairman
has
testified.
they're
losing
money,
but
that
could
simply
mean
that
the
newspaper
industry
has
high
fixed
costs,
and
therefore,
at
the
pricing
that
they're...
that
they're
engaged
in,
they
don't
recover
the
totality
of
their
fixed
costs.
i
don't
think
that
would
necessarily
constitute
predatory
pricing.
if,
in
fact,
any
newspaper
is
engaged
in...
in
what
constitutes
predatory
pricing,
yes,
i
think
the
justice
department
would
look
at
that
quite
seriously.
but
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
suggest
predatory
pricing;
the
antitrust
division,
which
looked
at
this
very
carefully,
never
once
suggested
predatory
pricing--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--the
administrative
law
judge
acknowledged
there
was
no
predatory
pricing.
the
first
time
it
came
up
was
on
the...
in
judge
wald's
opinion,
with
respect
to
the
denial
of
rehearing
it
back,
and
judge
silberman
pointed
out
in
his
separate
opinion
that
that
claim
was
simply
barred
by
principles
of
exhaustion.
it
had
not
been
raised
in
either
the
administrative
proceedings
or
in
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
by
the
petitioners,
and
it
would
be
quite
unfair
to
the
parties
in
this
case
to
consider
at
this
point
in
time
the...
the
prospect
that
some
type
of
predatory
behavior
is
being...
is
going
on
here,
when
the
record
basis
for
that
had
simply
not
been
established.
the
petitioners
did
not
take
part
in
the
administrative
proceedings
in
this
case.
and
no
one
that
did
take
part
in
the
administrative
proceedings
raised
any
claim
about
predatory
pricing.
furthermore,
i
think
there's
some
inconsistencies
here
because
on
the
one
hand
the
petitioners
claim
that
maintaining
low
prices
would
be
predatory
and
therefore
unlawful,
but
on
the
other
hand
they
say
that
of
course
predatory
pricing
almost
never
happens
and
so
it
would
be
wildly
improbable
to
imagine
that
the
news
is
not
going
raise
prices
if
a
joa
is
denied.
i
don't
think
they
can
quite
have
it
both
ways.
let
me...
let
me
try
if
i
might
just
to
go
back
again
to
what
i
think
the
attorney
general
relied
on,
but
to
point
out
that
the
findings
of
the
attorney
general,
he
made
what
i
believe
to
be
four
critical
factual
determinations
in
this
case,
were...
were
reviewed
by
the
district
court...
united
states
district
court...
and
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
were
upheld
by
both
of
those
courts,
and
it's
quite
well
established
that
this
court
does
not
ordinarily
undertake
to
review
the
factual
determinations
of
two
concurrent
lower
courts
obvious...
absent
some
very
obvious
or
exceptional
showing
of
error,
and
we
don't
think
that
anything
the
petitioners
have
presented
in
this
case
can
constitute
something
of
that
magnitude.
let
me
mention
briefly
the
four
facts
that
the
attorney
general
relied
on.
first,
which
has
already
been
mentioned,
the
detroit
free
press,
which
was
indicated
to
be
the
failing
newspaper,
had
lost
consistently
over
a
seven-year
period
substantial
sums
of
money
amounting
in
total
to
some
$83
million
from
1979
to
1986.
the
losses
went
up
during
that
period
every
year
except
one,
so
they
are
steadily
mounting.
that's
undisputed.
the
alj
found
that...
the
attorney
general
found
that.
petitioners
don't
challenge
that.
second,
the
attorney
general
agreed
with
the
conclusion
of
both
the
antitrust
division,
which
testified
to
this
point,
and
the
alj
that
the
free
press
had
no
way
unilaterally
to
extricate
itself
from
this
pattern
of
ever-deepening
losses.
the
attorney
general
in
fact
specifically
instructed
the
administrative
law
judge
to
look
into
the
options
that
the
free
press
had.
the
administrative
law
judge
devotes
18
pages
of
his
opinion
to
an
analysis
of
all
the
various
courses
of
action
that
might
be
available
to
the
free
press
in
order
to
extricate
itself
from
the
situation.
he
concludes
that
none
of
those
options...
raising
prices
of
the
newspaper,
raising
advertising
rates,
changes
in
management,
anything
else...
none
of
it
was
realistic.
and
that's
really
undisputed,
too.
petitioners,
despite
their
quibbling,
have
not
directly
challenged
that
finding.
third,
and
we've
already
touched
on
this,
the
attorney
general
disagreed
with
the
alj
with
respect
to
the
probability
that
the
news
would
not
raise
its
prices
in
the
future.
he
thought
that
given
everything
in
the
record,
that
it
would
hardly
reflect
unsound
business
judgment
for
the
news
not
to
raise
its
prices
with
so
many
indications
that
the
free
press
had
already
abandoned
any
hope
of...
of
maintaining
market
dominance--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i
think
the
attorney
general...
yes,
the
attorney
general's
opinion
clearly
indicates
that
he
regards
the
news
as
the
stronger
paper,
as
the
paper
with
the
greater
reserves
and
the
greater
ability
to...
to
outlast
the
free
press
at
this
point
in
time.
there's
not
a
finding
that
the
news
was
dominant
in
the
sense
in
which
you
talk
about
a
dominant
paper
versus
a
failing
newspaper,
nor
is
there
any
finding
here
of
a
downward
spiral,
but
the
attorney
general
indicates
that
the
news,
in
his
opinion,
is
clearly
in
a
superior
position.
i
think
the
record
evidence
amply
supports
that.
if
you
look
beyond
the
total
circulation
numbers,
total
daily
circulation
throughout
the
state,
and
look
at
the
various
factors
that
go
into...
to
revenue-raising
ability,
the--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
i
think
the
news
was...
would...
would
look
at
two
things.
first
of
all,
they
would
look
at
the
fact
that
they
have...
earn
60
percent
of
the
total
advertising
revenues
in
this
market
and
the
free
press
only
40
percent,
that
they
have
real
strengths
in
the
revenue...
and
that's...
75
percent
of
the
newspaper's
revenue,
is
advertising...
and
they
have
considerable
strengths.
for
example,
the
news
has
consistently
maintained
70
percent
of
the
classified
advertising
in
this
market.
but
it's
not
just
the
fact
that
they
have
those
strengths,
it's
also
the
fact,
you
must
recall,
that
throughout
this
period,
and
i'm
talking
now
from
'83-'84
to
'85-'86,
when
the
free
press
has
basically
broken
off
joa
discussions
with
evening
news
association,
the
closely-held
company
that
then
ran
the
news,
and
has
initiated
this
thing
called
operation
tiger,
where
the
free
press
is
trying
everything
it
possibly
can
to
improve
the
quality
of
its
newspaper
in
order
to
improve
its
position
in
the
detroit
market.
the
free
press
has
throughout
this
period
has...
it
brought
in
a
new
management
team.
they
brought
in
their
team
from
philadelphia
that
in
fact
had
won
the
newspaper
war
there.
they
invested
$22
million
in
a
new
publishing
plant
in
the
detroit
riverfront,
which
is
designed
to
go
out
and
get
papers
out
faster
and
with
better
quality.
they
do
many
things
to
improve
the
quality
of
the
papers.
they
have
more
sports
coverage,
more
international
coverage,
more
color
graphics
and
so
forth.
they
put
a
total...
the
chairman
testifies
they
put
a
total
of
$176
million
of
cash
from
1977
through
1985
or
'86
into
the
free
press.
what
happens?
they
don't
really
put...
they
don't
really
change
the
numbers
at
all.
if
you
look
at
the
various
tables
in
the
alj's
opinions
that...
that
talk
about
circulation,
circulation
in
the
primary
market
area,
circulation
on
sunday,
the
advertising
revenue
figures,
they're
all
quite
constant
throughout
this
period.
the
relative
percentages
of
the
news
and
the
free
press
basically
don't
budge,
and
this
is
at
a
time
when
the
free
press
is
pulling
out
all
the
stops
competitively
to
try
to
do
everything
it
can
to
obtain
a
dominant
position
in
this
market,
so
the
free
press
having
done
that
and
not
succeeded
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
having
gannett
show
up
and
purchase
the
evening
news
association
with...
with
all
of
the
resources
that
gannett
has
and
its
reputation
for
aggressive
marketing
and
so
forth,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
not
illogical
in
that
situation
for
both
the
news
to
assume
that
if
it
stays
the
course
for
a
while
longer
the
free
press
is
going
to
exit
the
market.
and
it's
not
illogical
for
the
free
press,
as
its
chairman
testified
in
this
case,
to
decide
that
it's
going
to
close
if
the
joint
operating
agreement
is
not
approved.
the
fourth
fact
that
the
attorney
general
found,
and
i
think
this
is
also
important
to
the
discussion
here,
is
that
he
found
that
the
papers'
behavior
was...
reflected
entirely
proper
marketing
strategies
and
entirely
responsible
conduct.
he
rejected
the
claim
that
poor
management
or...
or
some
type
of
improper
conduct
was
in
any
way
responsible
for
the
paper's
behavior.
as
he
put
it,
the
papers
had
engaged
in
energetic
but
entirely
responsible--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--no,
the
attorney
general
did
not
consider
that
possibility
because
no
one
had
raised
it
in
the
administrative
proceeding.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
not
necessarily,
because
as
i
tried
to
explain
before,
it's...
it's
conceivable
that
the
papers
could
be
losing
money
and
yet
not
being
engaged...
not
engaged
in
anything
that
would
be
described
as
predatory
in
terms
of
pricing
below
marginal
cost,
pricing
below
average
variable
cost,
or
anything
of
that
sort.
predatory
pricing
is--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--that
is
a
different
question...
i
hadn't
thought
about
that,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that
is
a
distinct
question.
i
mean,
what
we
have
here
of
course
is...
the
newspapers
negotiated
joa
in
1985.
at
that
time
they
hadn't
exchanged
complete
financial
data.
they
really
didn't
know
what
each
other's
circumstances--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--that's
correct,
and
the
reason
why
they
agreed
upon
this
50-50
profit
split...
which,
by
the
way,
is
not
at
all
unusual.
fully
50
percent
of
the
joas
that
were
negotiated--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--of
the
four
preceding
applications
prior
to
this
one
in
the
post-act
period,
none
of
them
had
a
50-50
split,
but
if
you--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i
think
that's
correct.
i'm
not
absolutely
sure
about
that.
but
anyway,
in
1985,
at
the
time
the
negotiations
takes
place,
the
news
doesn't
know
what
the
free
press'
intentions
are
and
vice
versa;
the
free
press
doesn't
know
what
the
news'
intentions
are.
it
makes
sense
under
those
circumstances,
i
think,
to
reach
the
type
of
agreement
they
had,
and
i
don't
think
that
any
conclusion
could
be
drawn
at
all
at
that
point
in
time
about
the
intentions
of...
of
the
parties
that...
that
you're
speaking
of.
now,
now...
whether
the
attorney
general
sua
sponte
thought
that
something...
some
inquiry
should
have
been
made
based
on
this...
this
later
testimony
or
not,
i
just
don't
think
that
that
was
presented
to
him,
nor
was
it
particularly
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
joa,
given
the
circumstances
under
which
it--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--yes,
i
will
agree
with
that
statement.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
think
that...
it's
quite
consistent
with
what
the
attorney
general
has
said
here.
i
think
that
in
terms
of
analyzing
this...
this
rather
illusive
question
about
the
mixed
motives
that
the
petitioners
have
presented,
that
it...
it's
very
important
to
distinguish
between
vigorous,
energetic,
lawful
competitive
activity
and
anticompetitive
activity.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
safe
to
infer
from
the
attorney
general's
decision
and
safe,
based
on
everything
i
know
about
what
the
justice
department
has
done
in
this
area
in
the
past,
that
if
the
parties
have
engaged
in
any
kind
of
anticompetitive
activity
in
order
to
try
to
secure
a
joa,
that
that
would
be
sufficient
grounds
under
the
policies
and
purposes
inquiry
to
deny
it.
for
example,
if
there
were
any
evidence
that
they
had
conspired
or
colluded
in
order
to
get
a
joa,
which
is
really
what
the
road
map
suggestion
amounts
to,
that
somehow
papers
are
going
to
see
this
decision
and
think
that
they
can
go
out
and
enter
into
some
kind
of
agreement
to
lose
money
for
five
or
six
years
and
then
one
of
them
will
testify
that
he
won't
raise
prices
and
so
forth
and
he'll
go
get
the
joa.
if
there's
any
suggestion
of
that,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
it
would
be
proper
to
deny
the
application.
if
there
was
a
suggestion
that
predatory
pricing
had,
in
fact,
been
responsible
for
these
losses
or
for
driving
one
of
the
papers
out
of
business,
i
think
it
would
be
proper
to
deny
the
joa
and--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--if...
if
i--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i
want
to
be
careful
about
what
i
say
here.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
will
not
concede
that
it
would
have
been
predatory,
it
was
predatory
or
anything
like
that.
i
think
that
that
kind
of
claim
is
completely
barred
by
principles
of
exhaustion
of
remedies.
it's
not
in
this
case
at
all.
however,
if
you
did
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
only
reason
the
paper
was
going
to
go
out
of
business
was
because
of
post-agreement
predatory
activity,
i
would
agree
with
you,
yes.
that
would
be
sufficient
circumstance,
but
that's
not
this
case...
at
least
that's
not
the
record
that
was
made
in
this
case.
and
i
think
it
would
be
quite
unfair
to
these
newspapers
to
send
the
case
back
because
of
some
possibility
that
not
what
we
know
now
after
three
rounds
of
appeals
and
so
forth...
maybe
that
little
aspect
of
the
case
needs
further
exploration.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
let
me...
let
me
try
to
clarify
that,
justice
rehnquist.
it
seems
to
me
that
before
you
get
into--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i
think
we
do
agree
with
basic...
the
basic
thrust--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--of
what
judge
silberman
said
about
the
chevron
doctrine.
i
think
that
was
essentially
correct.
our
position,
however,
is
that
we
don't...
the
court
need
not
really
get
into
this
matter
in
this
particular
case.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
first
thing
you'd
want
to
ask
yourself
before
you
plunge
down
some
road
examining
the
nuances
of
the
chevron
doctrine
is,
is
there
a
disputed
question
of
law
in
this
case
wherein
the
administrative
decision-maker
decided
that
the
statute
meant
one
thing,
and
the
petitioners
are
claiming
it
means
something
else.
and
petitioners
obviously
disagree
with
this
decision.
they
think
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious,
but
i'm
having
great
difficulty...
a
great
deal
of
difficulty...
ascertaining
exactly
wherein
they
think
the
attorney
general
adopted
a
construction
of
the
newspaper
preservation
act
which
is
contrary
to
the
intent
of
congress.
judge
silberman,
interestingly
enough,
thought
that
the
point
of
disagreement
was
that
petitioners
were
maintaining
that
you
couldn't
get
a
joint
operating
agreement
unless
you
were
in
a
downward
spiral.
he
though
that
they
were
advocating
a
kind
of
per
se
rule,
that
you
construe
the
statute
that
way.
the
fact
the
petitioners
disavowed
that
construction
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
their
reply
brief...
and
they
don't
seem
to
press
it
in
this
particular...
in
this
court,
so
that
the
issue
that
judge
silberman
used
as
his
jumping
off
point
for
engaging
in
this
chevron
discussion
is
based
on
what
petitioners
have
said
so
far,
really
not
presented
in
this
particular
case.
and
so
i
think
the
court
before
it
starts
talking
about
chevron...
i
think
this
is
perhaps
where
judge
silberman
made
his
mistake...
first
ought
to
identify
the
legal
issue,
in
fact,
that
requires
that
kind
of
treatment.
i
would
say
the
same
thing
about
the
canons
of
construction.
the
exceptions
to
the
antitrust
laws
should
be
narrowly
construed.
canons
of
construction
are
used
for
resolving
legal
issues,
questions
of
legal
interpretation.
they're
not
sort
of
general
standards
of
review
that
we
apply
in...
in
cases
involving
questions
of
the
application
of
law
to
particular
factual
circumstances.
just
to
go
back
very
briefly
to
the
attorney
general's
factual
determinations,
the
four
determinations
that
the
papers
are
losing
money,
the
free
press
has
no
unilateral
way
out,
the
news
is
unlikely
to
raise
its
prices,
and
the
paper's
engaged
in
entirely
proper
activity.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
accept
those
four
factual
determinations...
and
under
the
two
court
rule
i
think
the
court
really
has
to
accept
those
two
factual
determinations...
there
can't
be
any
really
serious
contention
that
this
decision
was
arbitrary
and
capricious.
the
first
three
findings,
i
think,
establish
really
without
any
doubt,
that
the
free
press
has
to
be
regarded
as
a
failing
newspaper.
the
act
defines
a
failing
newspaper
as
one
which,
regardless
of
its
ownership
and
affiliations,
is
in
probable
danger
of
financial
failure.
the
only
previous
court
to
have
considered
what
that
language
means,
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
the
hearst
case,
said
that
that
should
be
interested
to
mean
that
the
newspaper
is
suffering
losses
which
more
than
likely
cannot
be
reversed.
the
attorney
general
specifically
adopted
that
as
his
understanding
of
what
the
statute
means.
well,
if
the
free
press
has
lost
money
for
seven
years,
if
they
have
no
way
unilaterally
to
get
out
of
the
situation,
and
if
their
arch
rival,
the
news,
is
not
going
to
let
them
off
the
hook,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
draw
any
conclusion
except
that
they
are
in
a
probable
danger
of
financial
failure.
and
with
respect
to
policies
and
purposes,
i
think
the
finding
by
the
attorney
general
that
the
newspapers
had
engaged
in
entirely
lawful,
responsible
competition
really
defeats
any
claim
that
they...
that
the
application
should
be
denied
on
policies
and
purposes
grounds.
obviously
if
the
free
press
is
going
to
fail,
the
primary
policy
and
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to
preserve
independent
editorial
voices,
and
that
policy
is
clearly
fulfilled
by
granting
the
application
in
this
case.
the
attorney
general
went
beyond
the...
the
one
policy
and
purpose
that
the
statute
mentions.
he
also
said
that
it
was...
that
the
general
considerations
of
competition
policy
should
be
taken
into
account
also,
and
i
think
that
also
has
been
satisfied
here
by
his
finding
because
i
think
it
should
be
taken
to
mean
that
no
anticompetitive
conduct
was
responsible
for
the
losses
that
these
newspapers
incurred
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no,
you're
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
you're
right.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
you're
correct,
justice
stevens.
i
overstated.
let
me...
let
me
just
try
to
bring
up
one
final
point
here,
which
i
don't
think
has
gotten
enough
emphasis
in
the
argument
this
morning
or
this
afternoon,
excuse
me.
the
petitioners
talk
a
lot
about
the
importance
of
the
policy
of
the
antitrust
laws,
pro-competition
policy,
the
economic
efficiency
objectives
that
are
obviously
reflected
in
those
statutes.
but
there's
another
policy,
i
think,
that
congress
was
concerned
about
in
this
case,
and
i
think
it's
one
that
congress
thought
was
more
important
than
the
policies
of
economic
competition.
that,
of
course,
is
the
policy
of
trying
to
preserve
two
or
more
editorial
voices,
independent
editorial
voices
in
communities
that
otherwise
would
be
denied
them.
congress
heard
a
lot
of
evidence
about
the
decline
of
the
newspaper
industry,
the
decline
of
junior
newspapers,
which
is
really
quite
distressing
in
this
case.
in
1910,
60
percent
of
american
communities
had
two
or
more
independent
competing
daily
papers.
by
1968,
shortly
before
this
act
was
passed,
that
had
fallen
to
below
5
percent.
and
the
record
in
this
case
indicates
that
if
anything,
the
trend
has
simply
continued.
we
now
in
this
country
have
about
1,500
cities
with
one
newspaper
owner
and
25
cities
with
two
or
more
newspapers
that
are
independently
owned
and
competing.
and
so,
i
think
when
the
attorney
general
was
making
his
decision,
he
was
very
cognizant
of
the
fact
that
congress'
primary
concern
here
was
to
make
sure
that
wherever
possible...
and
there's
not
very
many
places
where
it's
still
possible...
but
wherever
possible,
that
two
or
more
editorial
voices
be
maintained,
even
if
that
means
giving
up
a
little
bit
on
the
otherwise
unalloyed
economic
competition
that
would
exist.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
sad
to
say,
justice
scalia,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
cities
in
this
country
that
could
support
two
newspapers,
but
that
do
not
have
two
newspapers.
for
example,
since
this
act
was
passed
in
1970,
its
second
newspaper,
junior
newspapers
have
gone
out
of
business
in
washington,
d.c.,
baltimore,
cleveland,
philadelphia,
buffalo...
all
fairly
large
cities...
not
that
different
from
detroit.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no.
a
"could
support",
i
think,
in
the
petitioner's
use
of
it
means
that
if
there
was
some
kind
of
pricing
czar
who
was
able
to
somehow
intercede
and
determine
what
the
prices
of
these
newspapers
ought
to
be.
there
are
circulation
prices
and
advertising
prices,
then
they
could
make
money.
unfortunately,
there
is
no
such
thing
in
the
competition
situation,
where
the
two
newspapers
are
desperately
trying
to
avoid
the
downward
spiral;
to
avoid
having
their
circulation
begin
to
slip,
and
have
their
advertising
revenue
start
to
fall
off
and
all
of
sudden,
they
are
out
of
the
picture.
in
that
sort
of
situation,
the
competitive
reality
is
that
the
papers
will
not
price
at
levels
which
are
sufficient
for
the
two
of
them
to
last.
that
was
true,
for
example...
if
congress
was
aware
that
in
new
york
city,
which
is
the
biggest
newspaper
market
in
the
country,
there
had
been
quite
a
number
of
newspaper
failures,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
clearly
that's
not
a
situation
where
there's
not
sufficient
revenues
to
sustain
at
some
level
pricing,
more
than
one
newspaper.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
it
is
unusual,
justice
stevens.
in
philadelphia,
is
the
situation
that
both
the
news
and
the
free
press
were
looking
at
over
their
shoulders.
in
philadelphia
you
had,
at
one
time,
a
dominant
evening
paper,
the
bulletin,
i
think
it
was,
and
a
struggling
morning
paper.
the
morning
paper,
incidentally,
was
owned
by
knight-ridder.
knight-ridder
was
able
to
turn
that
situation
around
after
six
years
of
losses,
and
the
bulletin
eventually
went
into
a
tailspin
and
went
out
of
business.
so
i
think
there
were
certain
clear
parallels
between
philadelphia
and
detroit,
that
both
these
papers
were
looking
at
throughout
this
period
of
time,
and
it
explains,
i
think,
largely
why
they
were
competing
the
way
they
were
in
order
to
try
and
maintain
at
all
costs
their
market
shares,
and
that
led
to
the
losses
that
made
them
unprofitable.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
