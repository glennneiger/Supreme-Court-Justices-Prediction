mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
not
long
before
this
lawsuit
in
yonkers
was
filed,
justice
lewis
powell,
writing
in
dissent
in
the
columbus,
ohio
school
desegregation
case,
issued
a
warning
to
federal
judges
across
the
country.
he
warned
that
in
cases
involving
the
elimination
of
racial
discrimination,
of
eradicating
racial
discrimination
roots
and
branch,
that
federal
judges
would
confront
situations
in
which
local
elected
authorities
would
seek
to
abdicate
their
responsibilities.
they
would
welcome
judicial
activism,
justice
powell's
words,
rather
than
face
up
to
the
politically
difficult
and
sensitive
task
of
remedying
discrimination,
of
upholding
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
in
this
case,
judge
sand,
affirmed
by
an
able
and
unanimous
court
of
appeals,
presided
over
the
liability
phase
of
these
proceedings
and
then
the
equitable
remedial
proceedings
with
great
patience,
as
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
stated,
with
great
courage.
in
the
face
of
the
most
difficult
and
daunting
and
at
times
threatening
circumstances,
the
judge
never
flinched
from
doing
his
duty.
but
he
also
refused
to
permit
the
elected
authorities
of
yonkers
from
doing
their
duty.
he
refused
specifically,
even
though
he
considered
it,
he
refused
to
establish
himself
as
the
housing
czar
of
yonkers
by
creating
an
affordable
housing
commission,
which
he
considered,
but
which
the
city
objected
to,
the
city
council
members
objected
to.
he
thought
the
better
of
it.
he
also
declined
to
deem
legislation
passed.
he
had
indeed
in
the
past
taken
certain
steps
with
respect
to
deeming
certain
acts
to
be
done,
the
rule
70
approach,
which--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--he
has
done
it
with
respect,
justice
o'connor,
to
specific
sites
in
the
public
housing
arena.
there
are
two
aspects
of
the
remedy,
it
is
important
for
the
court,
as
i
am
sure
it
appreciates,
to
bear
that
in
mind.
the
first
part
of
the
remedy,
public
housing,
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
with
respect
to
that,
the
judge
has,
indeed,
from
time
to
time
deemed
specific
steps
to
have
been
taken.
but
he
said
in
this
instance,
involving
affordable
housing,
this
is
different.
this
is
such
an
important
and
pivotal
piece
of
legislation
that
i
am
not
going
to
deem
the
legislation
passed.
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
the
colloquy
that
is
set
forth
at
page
357
of
the
joint
appendix,
where
judge
sand
said
i
have
a
sense
of
what
my
powers
are,
but
also
what
is
appropriate.
if
i
knew
i
never
had
to
come
back
to
the
city
council
for
any
further
action,
then
i
might
very
well
be
willing
to
deem
the
legislation
passed.
i
believe
i
do
have
that
in
my
power.
but
i
know,
given
the
political
structure
of
yonkers,
that
i
will
have
to
come
back
to
them,
and
thus
i
want
to
consider
stripping
them
entirely
of
their
authority
by
creating
the
affordable
housing
commission,
reporting
to
the
court.
it
was
that
that
the
united
states
objected
to,
that
the
city
council
members
objected
to
and
that
the
city
objected
to.
on
what
grounds?
the
grounds
was,
do
not
strip
us
of
the
power
that
we
enjoy
under
state
law.
and
he
declined
to
do
that.
he
thought
the
better
of
it,
and
he
said
i
am,
therefore,
going
to
simply
hold
the
city
to
its
obligations.
and
what
were
its
obligations?
the
obligations
were
set
forth--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes,
your
honor.
the
consent
decree
was
entered
in
january
of
<nineteen
eighty-eight>
[=
1988].
the
colloquy
of
which
i
am
now
speaking
took
place
in
june
of
1988.
these
contempt
proceedings
occurred
the
following
month.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
they
were
not
in
that
colloquy,
but
the
attorney
for
the
city,
justice
kennedy,
represented
that
he
was,
in
fact,
conveying
to
the
court
the
strongly
felt
views
of
the
city
council.
he
didn't
enumerate
or
identify
specific
members,
but
he
was
speaking
for
the
city
council
in
that
particular
colloquy.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
i
think
this
judge
reached
the
stage
where
he
determined
that
there
had
to
be
obedience
to
law,
and
that
any
other
remedy
was,
in
fact,
unduly
intrusive
with
respect
to
principles
of
federalism
and
comity
that
this
court
has
mentioned
and
emphasized
time
and
again...
rizzo
against
goode,
milliken
v.
bradley
one...
concerns
about
unnecessarily
stripping
the
elected
authorities
of
their
power.
and
he
chose
instead
to
do
what
judges
have
done
from
time
immemorial,
which
is
to
hold
them
to
their
obligation,
to
their
duty
under
the
consent
decree
and
under
the
housing
remedy
order.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
at
pages
30
to
32
of
our
brief
we
enumerate
a
number
of
cases
arising
under
the
contract
clause
that
go
back
to
the
mid-19th
century,
where
federal
courts,
affirmed
by
this
court,
directed
local
legislative
bodies
to
take
specific
action
to
levy
a
tax
increase.
this
court,
in
an
opinion
by
justice
black,
who
was
a
friend
of
federalism,
said
in
the
griffin
v.
county
school
board
case--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--my
brethren
would
agree
with
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i,
i
must
respectfully
suggest
that,
in
that
case,
the
court
was
speaking
to
the
federal
judge
and
telling
the
federal
judge
what
was
permissible
or
impermissible.
and
what
the
court
said
in
language
which
is
quite
clear
is
that
the
federal
judge,
if
it
is
necessary,
can
direct
them,
them
being
the
elected
board
of
supervisors
of
prince
edward
county,
virginia,
to
exercise
the
power
that
is
theirs.
that's
what
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
do
not
quarrel
that
it
was
not
the
holding
in
the,
in
the
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
but--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
would...
i,
i
would
certainly
say
that
if
the
court
has
given
guidance
to
a
district
judge
as
to
what
can
be
done,
that
that
guidance
should
be
taken
very
respectfully
and
very
seriously.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
true.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
it
was
a
bit
more...
i
don't
dwell
on
that
one
sentence,
but
it
was
rather
specific,
justice
white,
with
respect
to
directing
them
to
levy
a
tax
increase.
that
is
fairly
specific.
it
doesn't
tell
them
how
much,
but
it
does
say
you
can
direct
them
to
levy
a
tax
increase.
but
there
are
other
instances
in
which
federal
courts
have,
with
this
court's
approbation,
ordered
the
enactment
of
a
particular
kind
of
statute
or
plan,
particularly
in
the
voting
rights
act
area
and
with
respect
to
reapportionment.
this
court's
decision
in
wise
against
lipscomb,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
is
quite
clear
that
at
least
as
a
temporary
remedy,
the
courts
can
in
fact
impose
a
specific
reapportionment
plan
on
a
state
or
local
jurisdiction.
in
the
fair
housing
area--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--in
that
instance
it
does
not.
that
would
be
an
imposition
by,
by--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--by,
by
the
court.
but
it
is,
in
fact--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
is
not
a
particularly
good.
however,
it
is
a,
it
is
a
temporary
expedient
prior
to
the
legislative
body
enacting
its
own
plan.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
if
one
looks
at
the
precise
terms
of
the
order,
the
order
of
july
26,
1988.
that
order
did
not
say
here
is
an
ordinance
which
you
must
enact,
very
specifically.
you
cannot
change
anything;
you
just
must
vote
to
enact
it.
it,
rather,
used...
the
language
of
that
order
was
tied
to
the
language
of
the
consent
decree
itself.
section
17
of
the
consent
decree
put
an
obligation
on
the
city
to
enact
a
legislative
package
that
would
accomplish
a
variety
of
things
in
order
to
make
affordable,
assisted
housing
available
for
lower-income
and
middle-income
residents
of
yonkers.
it
was
a
broad
mandate
that
was
vested
in
the
city
council,
directed
to
the
city
council,
which
they
could
have
complied
with.
as
the
court
of
appeals
specifically
said,
they
would
have
been
in
compliance
with
this
order
if
in
the
city
council
meeting
they
had
come
forward
in
good
faith
to
the
judge
and
said
we
now
have
alternative
b.
it
accomplishes
what
we
agreed
to
accomplish.
here
is
the
alternative.
but
they
did
not.
a
message
i
would
like
very
much
to
leave
for
the
court
is
they
simply
chose
not
to
obey.
and
furthermore,
they
said
we
don't
have
to
obey.
and
what
this
case
is
ultimately
about
is
the
power
of
a
court
to
direct
compliance
with
its
orders,
consistent
with
principles
of
federalism
and
comity.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
if
i
may,
the
authorities
i
would
principally
rely
upon
are
the
authorities
from
the
19th
century
and
the
early
20th
century,
which
in
case--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--there
was
none.
i
would
respectfully
urge
the
court
to
reject
the
applicability
of
that
doctrine
here.
immunity,
which
is
their
principle,
not
their
sole
claim,
immunity
has
to
do
with
being
sued:
being
sued
for
money
damages,
being
sued
for
injunctive
relief.
it
does
not
have
to
do
with
one's
obligation
under
law
to
comply
with
low...
lawful
orders
of
the
district
court.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
could
not
by...
the
courts
could
not
by
virtue
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
all
right.
they
are
relying
on
common
law
immunity.
they
want
this
court
to
create
doctrine
that
will
protect
them
as
a
shield
against
lawful
orders
of
a
federal
court.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
absolutely
not.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
separation
of
powers
concerns
would
be
grave
by
the
judiciary
directing
a
coordinate
branch
to
take
a
specific
action.
it,
it...
i
would
not
rule
it
out,
but
it
would
raise
the
gravest
separation
of
powers
question,
whereas--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--to
the
contrary,
again.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
gives
me
great
pause
because
of
principles
of
federalism.
i
would
be
gravely
concerned
with
a
federal
court
order
to
a
state
legislature.
it
is
not
unheard
of,
and
it
is
done,
but
that
raises
more
profound
questions
of
federalism
and
comity
than
it
does
to
a
local
council
which
does
not
even
enjoy
the
state
constitutional
immunity
that
exists
by
virtue
of
the
new
york
state
constitution.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
is
more
troubling
and
it
is,
indeed,
in
this
case,
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
district
court
said
instead
of
my
acting
as
a
legislature
as
they
now
suggest
he
should
have
done,
he
said
instead
i
am
going
to
use
a
traditional
power,
the
contempt
power,
to
enforce
an
obligation
and
which
will,
in
fact,
result
in
no
restructuring
whatsoever
of
the
local
governmental
apparatus
in
yonkers.
that,
in
my
judgment,
was
a
very
restrained
remedy
and,
indeed,
this
court,
justice
o'connor
in
her
dissent,
in
the
paradise
case
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia,
suggested
that
contempt
was
a
less-intrusive
or
less-heroic
remedy
if
you
will
than
imposing
a
regime
of
racial
preferences.
civil
contempt,
that
is
important;
this
is
not
a
criminal
contempt
case.
but
civil
contempt
is
a
time
honored,
as
this
court
well
knows,
traditional
and
indeed
everyday
way
that
courts
go
about
enforcing
their
orders.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
justice
kennedy,
those
concerns
are
in
fact
raised
by
mr.
harmon's
suggestion
as
to
what
the
court
should
have
done.
he
would
now
suggest
that
the
court
should
have
in
fact
enacted
that
legislation
itself,
as
opposed
to--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
responded
to
that
concern,
although
not
in
those
terms.
but
it
made
it
quite
clear
that
this
avenue
of
using
the
contempt
power
to
require
them
to
fulfill
their
obligations
permitted
the
political
process
to
run
its
course,
for
them
to
have
a
city
council
meeting,
to
have
a
hearing,
to
have
thoughtful
suggestions,
to
have
alternatives
advanced
that...
the
council--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
outcome
in
a
broad
sense
is
foreclosed
with
respect
to
the
requirement
to
enact
an
ordinance
that
accomplishes
what
part
6
of
the
housing
remedy
order
and
section
17
of
the
consent
decree...
remember,
the
consent
decree
was
final,
they
sought
to
vacate
it,
that
motion
was
denied.
that
is
final,
that
is
a
final
judgment
of
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
means
by
virtue
of
what
the
court
did
that
it
did
not
raise
those
profound
questions
of
the
nature
of
the
power
that
is
being
exercised.
that's
point
one,
which
isn't
responsive,
but
this
i
hope
will
be
responsive.
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
was
that
the
very
purpose
of
the
state
notice
and
hearing
requirement
was
to
give
the
city
council
an
opportunity
to
meet
in
the
city
hall
of
yonkers,
not
for
judge
sand
in
chambers
to
say
here
is
the
ordinance
that
i
want
to
be
in
place
and
i
hereby
enact
it
myself
or
i
nominate
an
individual
or
entity
to
enact
this
ordinance.
he
said
rather,
let
the
political
process
run
its
course,
but
their
discretion.
i,
i--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--foreordained
in
the
sense,
i
must
agree
with
that,
with
respect
to
enacting
an
ordinance
that
fulfills
the
purposes
of
the
consent
decree.
but
there
would
be
an
enormous
amount
of
running
room
for
the...
for
the
council
to
come
back
to
the
judge
and
to
say
judge,
who
was
indeed
the
soul
of
patience
throughout
this,
we
have
not
been
obedient
in
the
past.
indeed
we
have
been
flagrantly
contumacious,
as
the
city
itself
in
its
brief
admits,
but
we
have
decided
to
do
our
duty.
here
is
our
alternative--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
option
is,
indeed,
always
open
to
them,
but
they
have
not
sought
to
avail
themselves
of
that
option.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
true.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
true.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
well,
i
would
think
it
is
in
my
favor.
it
is
used
against
me
by
my
colleagues
on
the
other
side
to
say
look,
the
contempt
citation
against
the
city
itself
was
efficacious.
on
september
9,
1988,
once
this
court
denied
the
stay,
the
ordinance
was
indeed
passed,
but
only
at
an
expense
to
the
city,
the
people
of
yonkers,
ultimately
the
victims
of
discrimination
themselves.
and
this
court
has
made
clear
that
in
the
equitable
remedial
setting
the
qualities
of
mercy
and
practicality
are
pivotally
important.
this
judge
knew
that
in
order
for
housing,
this
is
different
than
just
admitting
james
meredith
to
the
university
of
mississippi.
as
important
as
that
was
and
as
difficult
as
that
was,
this
is
getting
housing
built
that
is
market
rate
development
housing
that
requires
a
panoply
of
changes
in
zoning
laws,
tax
laws--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--well,
in
this
instance--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
the
principles
of
equity
constantly
must
guide
the
judge.
i
do
not
think,
however,
that
the
judge
should
in
fact
say,
absent
the
most
extraordinary
circumstances,
that
even
though
there
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
a
proven
violation
of
the
constitution,
and
i
know
that
there
is
a
remedy
that
would
be
effective,
that
it
is
too
difficult,
it's
too
divisive,
it's
too
sensitive,
and
therefore,
i
will
not
as
a
matter
of
discretion
remedy
discrimination.
the
underlying
duty
of
the
court
is
to
remedy
the
discrimination.
the
court
cannot
do
the
impossible--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
beg
your
pardon?
[laughter]
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
not
at
all.
we
never
reached,
my
reading
of
this
record
suggests
that
we
never
reached
the
point
of
impossibility,
and,
indeed,
the
remedy
is
moving
forward
with
the
political
structure
of
yonkers
intact.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
quite
right.
the
judge
may
not,
this
court
has
stated
most
recently
in
the
pangilliman
case,
authored
by
justice
scalia,
that
the
powers
of
equity
are
broad,
but
they
are
not
so
broad
that
one
can
run
afoul
of
a...
of
a
statute,
much
less
a
constitution,
but--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--mr.
harmon
would
have
you
believe
that
the
only
ordinance
of
concern
was
the
zoning
ordinance;
that...
that's,
with
all
respect,
completely
wrong.
the
housing
remedy
order,
and
i
invite
the
court's
attention
to
part
6
of
the
original
housing
remedy
order,
and
then
section
17
of
the
consent
decree.
this
is
new
law.
it
is
not
just
let's
override
the
zoning
statutes
or
another
ordinance
of
yonkers.
this
is
new
law
to
create
something
that
does
not
exist.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
the
forbidding,
or
the
intentional
discrimination
against
individuals
on
grounds
of
race
with
respect
to
housing,
housing,
both
public
housing
and
market-rate
assisted
housing.
this...
the
issue
that
has
come
before
us,
is
not
public
housing.
this
is
market-rate
assisted
housing,
which
is
eventually
going
to
be
built
by
private
developers
who
will
have
a
certain
percentage
of
those
apartments
or
townhouses
devoted
to,
to
lower-income
and
middle-income
housing.
that
is
complicated
stuff.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
have
to
disagree.
that
was
not
all
that
the
affordable
housing
ordinance
did.
it
created
and
facilitated
a
complex
set
of
what
were
called
mandated
incentives:
here
are
some
attractions
for
private
developers
to
go
out
and
do
something
that
they
may
not
otherwise
do.
that
is
different--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--there
were
tax
incentives,
tax
abatements,
and
the
like,
but
there
were
a
series
of,
the
term
used
in
section
17
is
mandated
incentives.
a
very
complicated
package
was
going
to
have
to
put
together.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
we
have
moved
beyond
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
no,
the
point
that
i
have
moved
to
is
the
capacity
of
the
court
to
enforce
an
obligation,
a
decree.
they
had
agreed
to
the
decree.
this
was
an
obligation.
the
obligation
was
not
we
will
do
that
which
is
minimally
necessary
in
order
to
eliminate
unconstitutional
discrimination.
that
was
not
the
obligation.
the
obligation
was
set
forth
in
the
terms
of
a
consent
decree,
section
17
put
this
affirmative
obligation
on
them
to
enact
a
very
comprehensive--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--to
enforce
its
own
judgment,
which
is
designed
to
eliminate
racial
discrimination
by
remedy--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the
zoning
ordinance,
i,
i,
i
hate
to
be
stubborn
on
the
point,
but
it
wasn't
the
zoning
ordinance
that
was
unconstitutional.
it
was
we
must
build
in
the
other
three
quadrants
of
yonkers,
at
least
as
the
goal,
800
assisted
housing
units,
and
we
are
going
to
have
to
take
a
lot
of
steps
in
order
to
do
that;
zoning
changes
are
only
part
of
it.
the
zoning
didn't
say
thou
shalt
have
no
assisted
housing
here.
that
wasn't
the
problem.
the
problem
was,
and
everyone
agreed
that
this
was
the
problem:
there
had
to
be
a
complicated
set
of
incentives
developed
so
that
private
developers
would
want
to
come
forward
and
build
housing
that
lower-income
people
to...
could
go
into.
i
think,
with
all
respect,
it
fails
to
appreciate
the
complexity
of
this
record
by
saying
there
is
simply
one,
or
even
two,
ordinances
that
could
have
been
overridden.
i
quite
agree--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
thank
the
court.
