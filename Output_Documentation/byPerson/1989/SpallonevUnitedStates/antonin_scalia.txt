justice
scalia
i
have
some
trouble
with
looking
to
the
wishes
of
the
constituents,
because
it
seems
to
me
the
basic
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
court
can
order
something
the
constituents
don't
want.
i
think
you
assume
that
if
it
followed
the
appropriate
procedure
it
could
order
this
housing
to
be
built,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
constituents
really
don't
want
it.
justice
scalia
how
can
we
use
the
constituents
as
the
test
of
what
can
be
permitted?
justice
scalia
even
when
it
violates
a,
a
superior
federal
law.
if
there
is
a
federal
statute
or
a
federal
requirement
that
these
houses
be
built,
how
does...
how
do
the
local
majority
of
the
constituents'
views
come
into
the
play
at
all?
justice
scalia
mr.
harmon,
i
have
some,
some
misgivings
about...
extending
the
speech
or
debate
clause
in
the
federal
constitution,
not
only
to
state
legislatures
but
even
to
state,
city
councils.
what
if
the
state
itself
doesn't
think
that,
that
city
councils
by
and
large
are
responsible
enough
that
they
should
be
given
the
full
protection
of
the
speech
or
debate
clause,
which,
after
all,
prevents
even
a
libel
action
against,
you
know,
the
most
terrible
libels
uttered
in,
in
the
course
of
the
debates.
you
have
a
state
who
says
you
know,
we
know
our
city
councilmen
and
by
and
large
they
are
not
a
responsible
enough
lot
that
we
are
going
to...
we,
we
are
going
to
immunize
them
to
go
about
slandering
the
whole
world
like
that.
you
say
they
can't
do
that,
the
federal
constitution
protects
these
city
councils
against
libel
action,
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
scalia
no,
but
you
are
arguing
on
the
base
of
federal
constitution
here.
let's
assume
new
york
state
doesn't
have
that,
in
fact
let's
assume
the
state
legislature
enacts
a
statute
allowing
members
of
city
councils
to
be
sued
for
libel.
you
would
say
that
is
an
unconstitutional
statute,
that
the
majesty
of
the
federal
constitution
prevents
city
councilmen
from
libel
actions.
justice
scalia
well,
then
you
are
not
arguing
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
now,
maybe
there
is
some
other
principle
in
the
constitution
that
says
that
courts
can
enact
legislation
that
isn't
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
justice
scalia
yes.
i
think
what
you
are
talking
is
separation
of
powers,
but
not
necessarily
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
the
implications
of
extending
the
whole
speech
or
debate
clause
to
a
city
council--
justice
scalia
--well,
well,
put
it
this
way.
suppose
a
state
court
had
issued
this
very
order,
to
enforce
a
federal
constitutional
violation.
could
you
have
come
here?
suppose
a
new
york
state
court
ordered
the
yonkers
councilmen
to
enact
this
ordinance.
would
you
have
had
a
constitutional
claim
here?
justice
scalia
of
course,
to
the
extent
it
is
a
first
amendment
right
you
are
relying
on,
you,
you
are
not
asserting
that
that
is
not
waivable,
are
you?
justice
scalia
--but
it
would
be
okay
if
they
were
needfully
intruded
upon?
that,
that
wouldn't...
right
then,
that
argument
would
assume
that
they
could
needfully
be
intruded
upon.
justice
scalia
can
we
order
congress
to
enact
a
statute,
general
starr?
justice
scalia
suppose
the
speech
or
debate
clause
didn't
exist.
do
you
think
that's
the
only
obstacle?
you
think
a
court
could
direct
the
congress
to
enact
a
particular
statute,
it
is
only
the
speech
or
debate
clause?
justice
scalia
you
think
the
separation
of
powers--
justice
scalia
--one,
one
last
step,
it,
it...
you
know,
they
refer
to
the
unification
of
two
powers
within
one
branch
is
the
definition
of
tyranny,
you
think
it
would
be
okay
for
the
court
to
unite
within
itself
judicial
and
legislative
powers
where
those
legislative
powers
are
federal,
but
it
would
be
okay
for
a
court
to
unite
within
itself
judicial
and
legislative
powers,
so
long
as
those
legislative
powers
are
only
state
legislative
powers--
justice
scalia
--which
are
probably
more
extensive
than
federal
legislative
powers.
justice
scalia
doesn't
that
scare
you
a
little
bit,
too?
justice
scalia
i
am
not
worried
about
federalism.
i
am
worried
about,
about
what
a
court
is
and
what
a
court
can
do.
can
a
court
act
as
a
legislature,
state
or
federal,
it
doesn't
matter
to
me.
justice
scalia
he
didn't
have
to
enact
an
ordinance.
isn't
the
only
thing
he
had
to
do
was
what
courts
always
do,
what,
what
john
marshall
did
in
marbury
versus
madison:
ignore
a
law
that
is
not
constitutional.
he
could
have
simply
ignored
the
existing
ordinance
and
said
any
housing
that
goes
forward
in
the
face
of
this
ordinance,
which
is
obstructing
what
is
constitutionally
required
and,
therefore,
is
unconstitutional,
can
simply
ignore
the
ordinance.
he
doesn't
have
to
write
a
new
one.
justice
scalia
what...
what
was
the...
what
was
yonkers
doing
that
was
unconstitutional
and
which
this
was
remedying?
what,
what
was
the
unconstitutional
act
that
this
was
remedying?
justice
scalia
it
is
complicated
stuff,
but,
but
the
only,
the
only
whip
that
the
city
had
over
the
whole
thing
was
the
zoning.
and
if
the
court
just
said
you
are
using
that...
you
are
using
that
tool
in
an
unconstitutional
fashion,
we
will
simply
disregard
the
zoning
law.
builders
can
go
ahead
in,
in
disregard
of
the
zoning
law.
that
is
classic.
that
is
the
classic
way
in
which
courts
handle
things
of
this
sort.
justice
scalia
well,
that
may
well
be,
but
that
was
not
unconstitutional.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
if,
if
you
ask
what
is
the
minimal
unconstitutional
action
that
had
to
be
eliminated
by
the
court,
it
was
simply
preventing
the
buildings
from
going
ahead
through
the,
through
the
zoning
law,
wasn't
it?
justice
scalia
oh,
i
am
sure
you
have,
but
that
is
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
but
at
this
stage
we
are
no
longer
talking
about
the
glorious
enforcement
of
the
constitution
by
a
district
court,
but
we
are
simply
talking
about
how
far
a
district
court
can
go
in
order
to
enforce,
enforce
an
agreement
that
isn't
required
by
the
constitution.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
be,
but
if
you
don't
enforce
it
to
the
hilt,
and
if
you
say
gee,
our
powers
just
don't
enable
us
to
enforce
it
to
the
hilt,
the
conclusion
you
come
to
is
not,
and
therefore
the
constitutional
violation
must
endure,
which
is
a
scary
conclusion
ever
to
have
to
come
to.
but
you,
you
acknowledge
that
you
can
eliminate
the
constitutional
violation
at
least,
although
perhaps
you
cannot
achieve
complete
compliance
with
the...
with
the
agreement
that
the
city
entered
into.
you
could...
you
could
achieve...
eliminate
the
constitutional
violation
simply
by
ignoring,
saying
we
will
take
no
account
of
this
unconstitutional
zoning
ordinance.
that
would
be
enough.
