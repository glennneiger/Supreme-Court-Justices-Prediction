justice
o'connor
so,
congress
could
deprive
the
legislators
of
their
common-law
immunity?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
that
is
all
it
is,
then
can
congress
change
that?
justice
o'connor
so,
you
are
relying
on
a
constitutional
basis,
not
merely
a
common
law
immunity?
justice
o'connor
you
are
relying
on
the
guarantee
clause?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
legislators,
if
they
enjoy
immunity,
can
waive
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
asked
you
whether
you
thought
it
could
be
waived
if
there
is
such
a
privilege?
justice
o'connor
what
is
the
effect,
then,
of
the
city
council
approving
the
consent
decree?
justice
o'connor
does
the
city
yet
have
the
800
housing
units
and
a
zoning
plan
to
accommodate
them?
has
it
ever
been
done?
justice
o'connor
and
how's
the
court
to
go
about
this?
i
mean,
this
has
been
a
long
time
brewing.
justice
o'connor
well,
can
the
district
court
just
impose
that
on
the
city?
justice
o'connor
yes
or
no?
justice
o'connor
and
that
is
not
more
intrusive?
justice
o'connor
xxx
immunity?
justice
o'connor
but
it
will.
how's
the
court
going
to
do
it?
justice
o'connor
how
is
the
court
going
to
effectively
produce
the
money
to
get
the
houses
built,
the
housing
built?
justice
o'connor
has
the
judge
now
done
that,
though,
to
a
degree?
justice
o'connor
well,
general
starr,
i
guess
no
one
here
is
disputing
that
the
court
can
do
something
to
compel
compliance.
i
didn't
hear
the
attorney
for
the
petitioners
argue
to
the
contrary.
i
think
it
is
more
a
question
of
whether
the
something
can
include
a
direct
order
to
the
legislators
to
vote
a
certain
way.
what
is
the
closest
case
authority
you
would
cite
to
us
for
that
proposition
over
a
claim
of
legislative
immunity?
justice
o'connor
was
there
a
claim
there,
to
your
knowledge,
of
legislative
immunity
that
was
asserted?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
the
court--
--but
you
just
said...
you
just
said
no.
you
said
the
speech
only
has
to
do
with
money
damages,
or...
oh,
the
immunity
only
has
to
do
with...
i
see.
i'm
sorry,
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
speech
or
debate.
justice
o'connor
i
just
can't
understand
how
it's
giving
greater
latitude
to
the
council
to
send
it
back
to
them,
telling
them
how
to
vote
than
it
is
to
go
ahead
and
put
it
into
effect.
i
mean,
that
is
just
hard
for
me
to
grasp.
