justice
kennedy
well,
if,
if,
if
you
stipulate
that
the
city
has
violated
the
constitution,
would
you
say
that
the
court
can
use
all
appropriate
means
to
require
the
city
to
remedy
that
violation?
justice
kennedy
all
right.
and
if
all
of
the
expertise
and
the
ability
to
raise
funds
and
so
forth
resides
within
the
city
council,
i
take
it
an
ultimate
and
permitted
and
appropriate
sanction
would
be
a
monetary
fine
against
the
city
of
new
york
for
failure
to
act...
or
against
the...
the
city
of
yonkers
for
failure
to
act?
justice
kennedy
fut
that
that
would
be
appropriate,
monetary
fine,
as
was
imposed
in
this
case
against
the
city?
justice
kennedy
then,
if
you--
--but
not
against
the
individual?
justice
kennedy
then
what
you
are
really
arguing,
if
you
have
recalcitrant
councilmen
who,
let
us
assume,
it
may
not
be
this
case,
for
their
own
political
advantage,
refuse
to
comply
with
the
court
order,
you
are
saying
that
there
is
a
right
in
the
city
councilmen
to
force
the
city
to
go
bankrupt?
justice
kennedy
and
to
force
the
city
to
go
bankrupt
if
that
is
what
they
conclude?
justice
kennedy
of
course
you
wouldn't.
would
you
have
a
federal
constitutional
claim
in
the
case
that
i've
put?
justice
kennedy
only
the
first
amendment?
justice
kennedy
were
the
city
councilmen
represented
personally
in
that
colloquy?
justice
kennedy
are,
are
you
saying
that
that
colloquy
and
the
rest
of
the
proceedings
in
the
district
court
are
tantamount
to
a
finding
that
all
other
remedies
were
inadequate?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
we
concede,
general
starr,
that
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
because
of
its
separation
of
powers
scheme
would
prevent
our
ordering
congress
from
voting
for
a
certain
act,
that
is
not
because
it
is
just
a
quirk
of
the
constitutional
structure.
it
is
because
there
are
some
very
basic
concerns
we
have
about
demarcation
of
the
lines
of
political
responsibility.
and
i
am
not
sure
why
those
same
concerns
are
not
abundantly
present
here,
and
why
just
as
a
matter
of
controlling
the
court's
discretion
as
being
a
wise
or
an
unwise
use
of
discretion,
all
of
those
considerations
aren't
applicable
to
the
city
council.
justice
kennedy
but
if,
if
that
had
happened
the
record
at
least
would
have
been
clear
as
to
how
the
legislation
was
created,
what
its
authority
was,
what
its
source
was.
but
what
you
are
suggesting
completely
blurs
the
line
of
political
responsibility
as
we
commonly
understand
it.
it
would
not
be
at
all
clear
to
the
people
of
yonkers
that
their
legislators
voted
for
the
action
because
the
legislators
approved
of
it
or
because
they
were
compelled
to
do
so.
justice
kennedy
but
it
is
a
charade
because
the
outcome
is
foreclosed.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
that
option
is
always
open
to
them.
