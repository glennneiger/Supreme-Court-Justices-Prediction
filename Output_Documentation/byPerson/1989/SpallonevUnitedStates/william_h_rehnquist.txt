chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-854,
spallone
v.
united
states;
88-856,
chema
against
the
united
states;
88-870,
longo
and
fagan
against
the
united
states.
mr.
harmon,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
need
to
get
into
that
rather
difficult
question
in
this
case,
mr.
harmon,
if,
if
your
argument
is
basically
legislative
immunity?
congress
has
not
acted,
at
least
that
is
your
position
i
take
it,
to,
to
remove
legislative
immunity.
why
don't
you
settle
for
that
rather
than
trying
to
raise
the
hypothetical
question
of
what
happens
if
congress
did
try?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
there
is
some...
there
are
some
things
that
maybe
a
court
just
cannot
bring
about.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
where
do
we
get
the
first
amendment
right
from,
mr.
harmon?
the
constitution,
obviously,
in
the
first
amendment
protects
freedom
of
speech.
in
other
sections,
it
talks
about
the
right
to
vote.
it
doesn't
give
the
impression
or
any
overlaps.
why
is
the
right
to
vote
in
the
city
council
meeting
a
form
of
freedom
of
speech?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
may
be
a
fundamental
act
of
democracy,
but
that
does
not
by
itself
demonstrate
that
it's...
it's
speech.
why,
if
a
legislator,
he
takes
an
oath
i
suppose
to
live
up
to
the
constitution
of
the
laws
and
i
suppose
he's...
doesn't
he
have
some
obligation
to
the
city
if
the
city
has
undertaken
to
do
something?
how
did
the
city
undertake
to
consent
to
this
decree,
consent
decree?
chief
justice
rehnquist
had
there
been
any
change
in
the
membership
of
the
council
between
the
time
of
the
city's
agreement
to
the
consent
decree
and
the
time
of
these
particular
votes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
is
a
matter
of
equity,
certainly.
you
could
just
say
that
remedy
was
improvident
without--
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
harmon,
your
time
is
expired.
thank
you.
general
starr.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
was
after
the,
after
the
consent
decree
had
been
entered?
chief
justice
rehnquist
general
starr,
your
opponent
made
the
statement
in
his
argument
that
no
federal
court
has
ever
before
required
legislators
to...
cast
their
votes
in
a
particular
way.
now,
what
you
just
said
makes
me
think
perhaps
you
disagree
with
him.
do
you
know
of
cases
where
legislators
have
been
required
to
vote
in
a
particular--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--that
is
dicta
though,
in
the
griffin
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
would
convert
a
great
deal
of
dicta
into
holding,
if
everything
a
court
says
that
might
be
done
in
a
case
be...
becomes
a
holding.
i
thought
a
holding
was
something
that
the
facts
of
the
case
required
the
court
to
decide
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
xxx
do
you
mean
holding
in
dicta
now?
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
now
does...
does
that
plan...
when
a
court
says
that
under
their...
voting
rights
act
this
plan
is
going
to
obtain
at
least
temporary...
does
that
require
enactment
by
the
legislative
body?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
that
isn't
a
very
good
example,
is
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
isn't
a
very
good
example,
is
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
long
as
it
reaches
a
foreordained
outcome.
chief
justice
rehnquist
doesn't
a
court
have
to
say
once
in
a
great
while,
mr.
starr,
this
is
just...
we
can't
bite
off
that
much?
just
because
there
is
so
much,
as
you
say,
getting
one
individual
admitted
to
a
university
is
quite
a
different
universe
than
the
sort
of
thing
the
district
court
was...
was
going
to
undertake
here.
now,
aren't
there...
does
the
law
say
that
he
must
be
careful
about
what
he
does,
but
come
what
may,
he
must...
he
may
accomplish
this
result
whatever
happens?
chief
justice
rehnquist
or
does
it
not
say
that
there
are
some
cases
he
is
going
to
stop
short
and
say
the
powers
of
the...
the
equitable
powers
of
this
court
just
do
not
encompass
going
that
far,
even
though
we
cannot
fully
remedy
the,
the
violation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
fiat
justitia,
ruat
coelum.
is
that
what
you
stand
for,
that
no
matter
what--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--let
there
be
justice,
though
the
heavens
fall.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
general
starr.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
88-854,
spallone
against
the
united
states
and
companion
cases.
the
petitioners
here
are
members
of
the
city
council
of
the
city
of
yonkers,
new
york.
in
1985,
in
a
suit
brought
by
the
united
states,
the
district
court
held
that
the
city
and
its
community
development
agency
reliable
for
intentionally
enhancing
housing
discrimination
in
violation
to
the
fair
housing
act
and
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
in
early
1986,
the
district
court
entered
a
remedial
decree
which
enjoined
the
city
of
yonkers
and
its
officials
from
intentionally
promoting
residential
segregation
in
yonkers.
the
decree
ordered
the
city
to
take
affirmative
steps
to
disperse
public
housing
throughout
yonkers.
among
the
steps
required
of
the
city
was
the
development
of
a
long
term
plan
for
the
creation
of
additional
subsidized
family
housing
units
in
yonkers.
a
person
to
a
consent
decree
which
is
approved
by
the
yonkers
city
council,
the
city
council
agreed
to
adapt,
within
a
certain
period
of
time,
legislation
creating
incentives
with
the
development
of
subsidized
housing.
but
pending
the
resolution
of
the
city’s
appeal
to
the
second
circuit
and
for
several
months
afterwards,
the
city
continued
to
delay
action
toward
implementing
the
long
term
plan.
finally,
on
july
26,
1988,
the
district
court
ordered
the
city
of
yonkers
to
enact
on
or
before
august
1,
1988
an
ordinance
designed
to
implement
the
legislative
packages
described
in
an
earlier
consent
decree.
the
order
went
on
to
provide
that
in
the
event
the
city
failed
to
adapt
the
legislation,
the
city
and
each
individual
city
council
member
would
be
required
to
show
cause
why
they
should
not
be
held
in
contempt.
the
order
specified
daily
fines
of
$500
per
day
for
the
members
of
the
city
council.
notwithstanding
this
threat
of
substantial
sanctions,
the
city
council
defeated
a
resolution
to
adapt
the
package
by
a
vote
of
four-to-three
and
all
of
the
petitioners
were
in
the
majority
of
that
vote.
after
a
hearing,
the
district
court
held
both
the
city
and
the
individual
council
members
in
contempt.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
second
circuit
affirmed
and
we
granted
certiorari.
the
city
meanwhile,
facing
ever
mounting
fines,
did
enact
the
legislation
complying
with
the
consent
decree
by
a
vote
of
five-to-two
of
the
city
council.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
conclude
that
the
portion
of
the
district
court’s
order
imposing
contempt
sanctions
against
the
individual
city
council
members
if
they
fail
to
vote
in
favor
of
the
court-proposed
ordinance
was
an
abusive
discretion
under
traditional
acquitable
principles.
the
petitioners
were
never
parties
to
the
action
and
the
parts
of
the
remedial
order
requiring
affirmative
steps
were
directed
only
to
the
city.
it
was
the
city
in
fact
which
capitulated
in
the
present
phase
of
the
case,
and
there
was
a
reasonable
probability
that
sanctions
against
the
city
alone
would
have
achieved
the
desired
result.
holding
elected
officials
in
contempt
for
the
manner
in
which
they
vote
is
extraordinary
as
the
district
court
itself
recognized.
we
think
that
court
should
have
proceeded
with
sanctions
first
against
the
city
alone
in
order
to
secure
compliance
with
the
remedial
order.
only
if
that
approach
failed
to
produce
compliance
within
a
reasonable
time
should
the
question
of
imposing
contempt
sanctions
against
the
individual
council
members
have
been
considered.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore,
reversed.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall,
justice
blackmun,
and
justice
stevens
have
joined.
