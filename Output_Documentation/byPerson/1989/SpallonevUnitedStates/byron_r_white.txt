you
think
the...
you're
arguing
for
legislative
immunity,
local
legislative
immunity?
justice
white
do
you
think
you
need
all
of
those?
justice
white
what
about
just
the
immunity
question?
justice
white
well,
is
that
constitutionally
based?
justice
white
so,
it
is
just
a
construction
of
some
other
federal
statute,
1983?
justice
white
which
some
statute
wasn't
intended
to
interfere
with?
justice
white
what
about
raising
the
money?
do
you
think
the
court
could
say
i
deem
that
the
council
has
passed
a
tax
measure,
or
a
bond
issue,
has
approved
a
bond
issue
for
this
purpose--
justice
white
--and
then
order
the
executive
branch
to
carry
it
out?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
everybody
seems
to
agree
that
the
city
was
bound,
and
you
agree
it
was
bound.
justice
white
and,
so
it
was...
how,
how
was
it
supposed
to
act?
justice
white
well,
you
say...
you
say
the
city
could
be
fined
for
not
living
up
to
its
consent,
don't
you?
justice
white
you
don't
think
the
members
of
the
council
owed
any
duty
at
all
to...
to
do
what
the
city
had
promised
to
do?
justice
white
i
know,
but
that
isn't
answering
my
question.
you
must
say,
though,
no,
the
individual
council
members
had
no
obligation
whatsoever
to
implement
the
promise
of
the
city.
justice
white
and
are
you
representing
them,
too,
or
do
they
have
different
counsel
here?
justice
white
well,
anyway,
he
did
it.
justice
white
is...
is
this
like
the
court
ordering
somebody
to
say
something
he
didn't,
doesn't
want
to
say?
courts
are
always
doing
that.
courts
are
always
ordering
employers
to
post
notices
that
they...
which
they
never
wanted
to
post.
justice
white
well,
it
is
because
the...
the...
the
employer
has
been
found
to
have
violated
a
law
and
they
want
to...
and,
and
the
agency
wants
to
provide
a
remedy,
and
they
say
post
this
notice.
justice
white
the
employer,
it
won't
do
the
employer
any
good
these
days
to
say
the
first
amendment
protects
me,
i
have
freedom
of
speech,
why
should
they
be
able
to
order
me
to
say
something
i
don't
want
to
say?
justice
white
are
you
willing
to
apply
that
here
in
the
first
amendment,
on
your
first
amendment
argument,
weighing,
weighing
the
governmental
interests
against
the
private
interests?
justice
white
xxx
said,
well,
just
to
make
it
clear
i
am
going
to
draft...
redraft
the
ordinance.
here
is
the
ordinance
as
it
is
now
deemed
to
have
been
enacted.
justice
white
well,
wouldn't,
wouldn't
the
court
have,
have
had
to
redraft
the
zoning...
the
existing
zoning
ordinance
so
everybody
would
know
what
the
law
is?
justice
white
i
know,
but
you
say
that
was
an
alternative,
a
less
intrusive
alternative.
justice
white
but
it
would
have
involved
redrafting
the
zoning
ordinance.
justice
white
your
argument
sounds
as
though
it
is,
it's...
it's...
you
could
make
just
as
strong
an
argument
of
saying
this
is
just
a
matter
of
equity;
this
is
just
a
matter
of
equitable
principles
applying
to
what
remedy
a
court
could,
could
issue,
without
even
raising
any
constitutional
issue.
justice
white
xxx
in
your
argument
you
could
say
normally
you
don't
impose
contempt
except
to
the...
as
a
last
resort.
justice
white
and
that
is
not
a
constitutional
argument.
that
is
just
an
argument
about
what
is
the
proper
remedy.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be,
but
of
course,
in
that
case
the...
it
didn't
really
say
that
legislators
could
be
required
to
vote
for
any
specific
piece
of
legislation.
they
just
had
to...
they
just
had
to
get
with
it
and
provide
for
the
reopening
of
public
schools.
justice
white
so
they
could
have
done
that
in
all
sorts
of
ways,
i
suppose.
justice
white
that's...
that's
more
like...
if
the
court
here
had
said
i
deem
this
legislation
to
be
in
effect.
that,
that
is
closer
to
this
voting
rights
example.
justice
white
i
take
it
the
liability
of
the
city
and
the
contempt
against
the
city
is
a
fore...
foregone
conclusion,
that
the
city's
liability
is
settled,
is
that
it?
justice
white
and
of
course,
the
running
fine
against
the
city
put
unbearable
pressure
on
the
city
council,
i
suppose.
and
one
of
them
finally
reacted
to
it.
justice
white
and
i
suppose
that,
that...
that,
is
arguably
in
your
favor,
i
suppose.
justice
white
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
if
this...
if
the
remedy
that
the
judge
employed
is
beyond
the
power
of
a
court,
or
it
shouldn't
be...
he
shouldn't
have
issued
that
kind
of
remedy,
that
then
the
enacting
of
an
ordinance
should
also
be
beyond
the
power.

tax
incentives...
tax
incentives
included?
