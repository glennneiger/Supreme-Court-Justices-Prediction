mr.
james
h.
harmon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there,
there
is
no
question
but
in
this
case
of
the
federal
government
has
the
power
to
squash
the
city
of
yonkers.
when
our
federal
courts
act,
they
act
directly,
not
through
fronts
and
not
through
proxies.
they
accept
the
responsibility
in
so
doing,
the
exercise
of
their
own
power.
no
federal
court,
not
even
in
the
civil
rights
movements
of
the
1960s
has
ever
found
the
need
to
ask
and
direct
a
legislator
to
cast
his
vote
in
favor
of
enactment
of
legislation
at
the
price
of
his
own
conscience
and
the
cost
of
his
freedom.
that,
i
submit,
is
just
not
the
way
that
we
do
things.
the
solicitor
general
argues
for
a
government
in
which
the
judiciary
is
supreme,
a
judiciary
which
drafts
laws,
directs
their
enactsment...
enactment,
interprets
them,
and
presumably
holds
people
accountable
for
their
violation.
it
is
just
this
type
of
concentration
of
power
that
the...
that
the
constitution
avoids
in
many
different
ways.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
as
well
as
first
amendment,
your
honor,
and
the
discretion
inherent
in
the
court
to
fashion
a
constitutional
remedy
and
the
limitations
on
the
court
in
fashioning
such
a
remedy.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
we
think
the
court
could--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--we
think
the
court
could
decide
this
on
that
basis,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
it's...
it's
based
upon
federal
common
law
as--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
a
question
of
federal
common
law,
and
we
think
that
is
the
whole--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--it,
it,
it
cannot,
your
honor.
it
would
be
our
position
that
for
congress
to
do
that
would
interfere
with
the
rights
of
the
states,
guaranteed
through
the
guarantee
clause
to
establish--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
yes,
your
honor,
although
the
cases,
both
tenney
and
lake
tahoe
estates,
do
not...
explain
in
any
detail
the
extent
to
which
congress
could
interfere
with
the
operation
of
legislative
immunity.
we
submit
that
if
the
congress
would
take
action
once
the
state
has
selected
its
particular
form
of
republican
government,
that
this
would
interfere
with
the
federal
government's
obligation--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--well,
i
think
i
as
best
i
could
was
answering
the
question
about
whether
or
not
congress
could
intervene,
and
in,
in
answering
the
question
i
was
giving
our
position
in
the
event
that
congress
had...
has
intervened.
but,
but,
but
we
do
believe
that
this
issue
can
be
resolved
simply
by
extending
the
principle
in
lake
tahoe
estates
to
local
legislators.
the
whole
purpose
behind
legislative
immunity
was
to
protect
our
form
of
representative
government.
that
was
the
entire
idea
behind
legislative
immunity
and
this
court
has...
has
accepted
the
principle
as
applied
to
state
legislators
and,
in
the
lake
tahoe
estates
case,
to
those
regional
legislators.
and
as
justice
marshall
said
in
his
dissent
in
that
particular
case,
there
really
was
no
particular
argument
that
could
be
advanced
to
deny
its
application
to
local
legislators
in
this,
in
this
particular
case.
however,
your
honor,
we
also
deal
in
this
case
not
only
with
the
issue
of
legislative
immunity,
but
with
the
court's
power
and
the
extent
of
the
court's
power
to
remedy
a
constitutional
violation,
and
we
would
say
also
the
obligation
of
the
court
to
remedy
a
constitutional
violation.
we'd
suggest
to
the
court
that
there...
that
there
is
an
underlying
principle
underlying
our
first
amendment
argument,
the
use
of
the
contempt
power,
as
well
as
the
court's
obligation
to
remedy
a
constitutional
violation.
and
it
would
be,
this
we
would
suggest,
that
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
courts
to
provide
a
measured
exercise
of
their
power
in
remedying
a
constitutional
violation,
taking
into
account
the
rights
of
those
who
are
not
before
the
court.
and
we
respectfully
suggest,
your
honor,
that
in
this
particular
case,
this
court
used
the
most
intrusive
means
when
it
came
to
the
personal
rights
of
the
councilmen
and
when
it
came
to
their
legislative
immunity.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
the
government
has
made
no
effort
to
argue
that
in
its,
in
its
brief.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
the
answer
is
we
do
not
believe
that
an
individual
legislator
can
waive
the
privilege.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
legislature
itself
can
waive
the
privilege,
because
it
is
designed
to
protect
our
form
of
government.
it
is
designed
to
protect
our
representative
form
of
government.
and
it
cannot
be
waived
by
an
individual
and
it
cannot
be
waived
by
the
institution
of
the
legislature,
because
in
the
final
analysis,
it
is
there
to
protect
the
right
of
the
people
to
select
those
who
they
would
have
to
represent
them.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
it
has
no
effect
whatsoever
on
the
rights
and
immunities
of
any
of
the
individual
councilmen.
it
is
our
position,
however,
that
the
city
is
bound
by
whatever
commitments
it
made
in
the,
in
the
consent
decree.
that
the
individual
legislators,
nonetheless,
still
retain
their
first
amendment
rights
and
their
vote,
and
they
continue
to
be
protected
by
legislative
immunity.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
no,
there
have
been
no
developers
even
selected
yet
for
the
800
affordable
housing
units,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
well,
i,
i,
i'd
suggest
to
you
that
we
are...
i
am
not
standing
up
here
as
any
kind
of
a
monday
morning
quarterback.
these
councilmen
were
held
accountable
through
the
use
of
the
contempt
power
for
refusing
to
enact
an
ordinance
which
had
been
drafted
by
experts
and
adopted,
and,
and
adopted
by
the
district
court.
and
it
was
a
zoning
ordinance,
it
was
an
overlay,
a
zoning
overlay
which
affected
all
of
the
zoning
in,
in
the
city
of
yonkers.
it
was
a
major
piece
of
legislation.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
in,
in,
in
fact,
and
i--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--yes.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
it
can
do
it
to
this
extent,
your
honor.
it
can
do
what
it
did
already
once
in
this
case,
which
i
just
became
aware
of
friday
and
which
i
advised
mr.
starr
a
short
while
ago.
it
can
enter
an
order
to
the
effect
that
the
zoning
in
yonkers
is
deemed
to
permit
a
certain
type
of
housing
in
a,
in
a
certain
part
of
yonkers.
although
the
briefs
don't
reflect
this,
and
this
is
again
not
a
question
of
second
guessing
the
district
court,
on
march
20,
1987
with
respect
to
public
housing,
the
district
court
in
fact
did
enter
an
order
deeming
that
yonkers
zoning
permitted
the
construction
of
this
public
housing.
and
just
last
thursday,
the
government
attorneys
appeared
before
judge
sand
and
asked
him
to
do
the
very
same
thing
with
respect
to
five
additional
sites.
now,
in
doing
that,
your
honor,
it
does
not
implicate
the
first
amendment
rights
of,
of
the
councilmen
to
vote.
it
does
not
affect--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--nor
immunity,
your
honor.
nor
immunity.
there
is
no...
the
court
in
this
case
lost
sight
of
what
really
was
important
here,
and
what
really
was
important,
as
your
honor
has,
has
pointed
out,
is
to
figure
out
a
way
and
to
get
moving
with
respect
to
building
housing
in
some
fashion.
turning
toward
the
councilmen,
using
means
that
only
left
them
as
targets
at
the
end
of,
of
the
line,
we
submit
missed
the
point
and,
and,
and,
and
was
a
case
of
using
intrusive
means
that
did
not
point
towards
the
accomplishment
of
the
objective.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
well,
in,
in
this
particular
case--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--in,
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
the,
the
question
of
cost
has
not
yet
arisen.
it
hasn't
gotten
to
that
particular
point.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
it
is...
there
is
a
difference
between
directing
an
executive
act,
in
our
opinion,
and,
and
directing
an
act
which
is
purely
legislative.
it
is
one
thing
to
levy,
to
levy
a
tax,
which
we
believe
would
be
a
legislative
act
and
something
that
a
court
simply
could
not
do.
that...
that...
that's
not
to
say
that
in
this
case,
or
even...
or
even
in
this
one,
your
honor,
that
a
court
would
be
powerless
to
act.
we
think
that,
that
courts
do
not
have
only
the
authority
which
is
not
barred
to
them,
but
there
are
limits
on
the
court's
authority,
and
the
courts
must
act
within
those
particular
limits.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
in,
in
this
particular
case
there
is
a
combination
of
market
incentives
encouraging
developers
to
come
in
and
granting
tax
abatements.
that
is
the
method
that
has
been
chosen
in,
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
we
think
that
the
court's
power
is
limited
by
the
constitutional
grant
of
its
power,
and
it
is
the
responsibility
of
courts
to,
to
say
what
the
law
is,
and
to
levy
a
tax
is
not
an
exercise
of,
of
the
judicial
power.
there
may
be
other
ways,
though.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
all
appropriate
means
within
its
power,
taking
into
account
the
rights
of
persons
who
are
not
before
the
court.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
we,
we,
we
would
suggest
that
the
contempt
power
be
a,
a
matter
of
last
resort,
and
that
there
would
be
some--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
but
not
against
the
individual,
right.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
there
is
a,
a
right
in
councilmen
to
exercise
their
judgment,
to
take
into
account
the
wishes
of
their
constituents,
to
take
into
account
their
own...
their
own
conscience--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--yes,
and
to
be
held
accountable
for
that
at
the
ballot
box,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
that
is--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--well,
we
don't
suggest
for,
for
a
minute
that
there
is
a
question
of
majoritarianism
here,
that
the
majority...
that
the
majority
should
rule,
your
honor.
we
do
suggest,
however,
that
the
wishes
of
constituents
is
simply
one
of
the
things
that
our
representative
form
of
government
permits
elected
officials
and
legislators
to
take
into
account--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--well,
we
respectfully
suggest
that
that
is
precisely
the
problem
that
has
been
posed
here
by
the
district
court,
that
this
court
is
being
put
in
the
position
of
deciding
which,
which
rights
should
be
superior.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
well,
they
may...
they
may
be
subordinate,
your
honor,
but
we,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
we...
we'd
suggest
that
the
views
of
the
constituents,
since
this
was
a
class
action,
were
views
that
should
have
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
district
court.
there
was
no
notice
here,
there
was
no
hearing,
there
was
no
fairness
hearing
before
the
court
accepted
this
particular
form
of
consent
decree.
yes,
in
the
final
analysis
the
court
could
have
disregarded,
and
had
every
right
to,
to
disregard
the
wishes
of
anybody
that
might
have
appeared
before
it
or,
or,
or
any
of
the
people
that
lived
in
yonkers.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
it
protects
the
state
government's
choice
of...
choice
of
form
of
government.
and
in
the
case
of
new
york,
there
is
a
provision
similar
in
the
new
york
state
constitution
to
the...
to
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
in
fact--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--no,
your
honor,
we
would--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--it's...
it's...
it's
article
3,
which
says
that
the
courts
have
judicial
power.
and
that
is
the
source
of
the,
of
the
court's
power.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
we
do
not
argue
that
immunity
under
the
speech
or
debate
clause
should
be
extended
to
local
legislators.
we
think
that
the
principle
of
legislative
immunity
already
accepted
by
this
court
would
be
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
extending
that
particular
immunity.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
we
would
have
had
a
constitutional
claim
based
upon
the
new
york
state
constitution,
and
the
arguments
would
have
been--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--under
the...
under
the
first
amendment,
yes.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
yes,
but
not
under
the...
not
under
the
principle
of
legislative
immunity.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
yes,
we,
we,
we
think
he
would
have.
however,
your
honor,
we
are
talking
here
in,
in
the
vote
of
a
councilman,
we're
talking
about
political
speech,
the
most
highly
protected
form
of
speech,--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
well,
there
is
a
question
of
balancing,
and
there
is
a
question
of
a
compelling
governmental
interest
in
that
particular,
in
that
particular
instance.
and
whether
or
not
that
intrusion
upon
a
first
amendment
right
is
warranted
in
this
particular
instance
that,
that
your
honor
has
posed.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
it
is
a
form
of
political
expression.
it
is
a
form
of
putting
out
ideas
on,
on,
on
public
issues
out
to
the...
out
to
the
public.
it
is
the
basis
of,
of
self-government.
the
act
of
voting
is
the
fundamental
act
of
democracy,
no
matter
how
it's
done.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
well,
that
is
not
clear
in
the
record,
those,
those
particular
events,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
well,
it
was...
it
was
bound
to
this
extent,
concerning
the
legislative
action
that
was
called
for
in
the,
in
the
consent
decree.
we
submit
that
that
type
of
a
provision
in
a
consent
decree
is
unenforceable,
an
agreement
to
enact
legislation
sometime
in
the
future,
especially
in
a
situation
like
this
where
there
are
no
particulars
at
all
outlined
in
the
particular
consent
decree.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
our
position
here
is
in
representing
the...
individual
councilmen,
your
honor.
the
city
was
bound
by
anything
that
was
enforceable
in
that
particular
consent
decree.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
i
think
perhaps
the,
the,
the
city
was
ill
advised
here
in
entering
into
a--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--there
was
no
legal
obligation
to
do
that,
insofar
as
the
enactment
of
legislation
was,
was
called
for.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
two
of
them
were.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
two
of
them
voted
against
it,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
i
represent...
i
am
counsel
of
record
for
all
councilmen
for
purposes
of
oral
argument.
i
represent
councilman
chema.
the
other
three
councilmen
have
their
individual
counsel.
but
with,
with
respect
to
those
councilmen
who
voted
against
the,
the
consent
decree
in
the
first
instance,
we
respectfully
submit
that
neither
one
of
those
councilmen
undertook
any
obligation
either
publicly
or
privately
at
that
time
or
at
any,
at
any
time
subsequent
to
that--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--that
means
at
the
time
that
they
voted
against
the
consent
decree,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
well,
there
was
one
later,
later
on
after
this
court
denied
the
stay
to
the
city
and
granted
the
stay
to
the
individual
councilmen.
in
fact,
one
of
the
councilmen
did...
did
change
his
vote
as
the
city's
fines
mounted,
and
did
make
a
judgment
on
his
own
that
it
was
in
the
interest
of
his
constituents
and
the
interest
of
the
city
at
that
point
to
vote
in
favor
of
the
legislation
that
the
district
court
had
directed
be
enacted
earlier
that
year.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
well,
i
think
he--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--yes,
sir.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
that
was
my
client,
justice,
yes.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
again,
that
is
not
an
issue
that
has
been
presented
by
the,
by
the
government,
but
it
would
be
our
position
that,
in
this
particular
instance,
the
first
amendment
act
of
voting
by
an
elected
legislature
in
favor
of
legislation
is
not
waivable.
there's
a
public
interest
inherent
and
important
in
the
act
of
that
particular
vote.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
well,
that
we
submit
is
an
executive
type
of
function
and
it
does
not--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--well,
it,
it
also
does
not
require,
and
we
question
whether
anything
in
the
constitution
permits
a
court
to
compel
someone
to
publicly--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--well,
there
is
a
question
of
the
competing
governmental
interest
on
one
side
as
opposed...
as
opposed
to
the
other.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
yes,
we
are
willing,
we
are
willing
to
do
that,
your
honor.
and
we
suggest
that
that
particular
balance
is
struck
in
this
way,
that
the
court's
order
was
totally
unnecessary.
since
the
court's
order
was
unnecessary,
since
the
court
could
simply
have
deemed
yonkers
zoning
to
permit
the
particular
housing
at
stake
here,
there
was
no
interest
at
all
to
be
served,
no
governmental
interest
at
all
to
be
served
by
directing
the
councilmen
to
vote
in
favor
of
the
zoning.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
excuse
me,
your
honor,
i
didn't
understand
that.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
that
is
not
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
case.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
it,
it
would
not
have
required
a
redrafting
of
the
zoning
ordinance.
it
was
permissible,
in
our
view,
for
the
district
court
to
do
simply
what
it
had
already
done,
namely
which
was
to
simply
enter
an
order
deeming
that
yonkers
zoning
permitted
the
construction
of
a
certain
type
of
housing
in
certain
parts
of
yonkers.
as
we
have
argued
here,
your
honor,
this,
this
is,
as
we
see
it,
a
case
of
ends
and
means,
and
we
believe
that
the
district
court
lost
sight
of
the
end
here,
lost
sight
of
the
goal,
which
was
housing
in
this
particular
case,
and
resorted
to
a
means
which
the
constitution
did
not
permit.
our
position
does
not
rest
on
the
principle
that
local
government
may
disobey
lawful
federal
court
orders,
as
the
solicitor
general
will
argue.
rather,
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
the
catholic
conference
case,
it
rests
on
the
central
principle
of
a
free
society
that
courts
have
finite
bounds
of
authority,
some
of
constitutional
origin
which
exist
to
protect
citizens
from
the
very
wrong
asserted
here:
the
excessive
use
of
judicial
power.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
the
constitutional
issue
is,
is
raised
by
the
fact
that
there
is
a,
a
proven
constitutional
violation,
that
the
court
is
exercising
its
authority
to
remedy
that
violation.
and
the
sole
question
we
would
suggest
before
this
court
is
what
the
court
can
do
within
the
limits
of
its
power
and
taking
into
account
the
rights
of--
mr.
james
h.
harmon
--and
that,
in
general,
is
our
position.
that
it
is
improvident
for
these
various
reasons:
that
the
rights
of
the
legislatures,
the
first
amendment
rights
were
needlessly
intruded
upon
and
that
their
legislative
immunity
was,
was
likewise
intruded
upon.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
in
this,
in
this
particular
case
the
court
had
an
alternative,
a
specific
alternative
which,
which
it
could
have
used
and
which
it
did
use
in
the
past.
therefore,
we'd
submit
that
in
this
particular
case,
the
court
did
have
a
less
intrusive
option
which
it
had
used
in
the
past
and,
for
whatever
reason,
which
maybe
the
solicitor
general
will
explain,
chose
not
to
do
that
again
but
chose
rather
to
focus
on
the
councilmen
and
the
contempt
power.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
we
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
h.
harmon
we
agree
that
the
court
could
resolve
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
contempt
power
and
the
court's
supervisory
authority
over
the,
over
the
exercise
of
the
contempt
power.
that
the
principle
is
the
least--
