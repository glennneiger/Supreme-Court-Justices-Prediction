justice
stevens
but
aren't
you...
don't
you
start
here
from
the
premise
that
there
is
a
federal
violation
that
the
court
has
the
power
by
appropriate
means
to
correct?
justice
stevens
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
constituents
are
very
much
opposed
to
it.
justice
stevens
so
don't...
aren't
the
views
of
the
constituents
necessarily
subordinate
to
the
court's
power
to
fashion
an
appropriate
remedy?
and
the
only
question
is
whether
this
is
an
appropriate
remedy.
justice
stevens
but
if
you
rely
only
on
the
first
amendment,
supposing
it
were
not
a
governmental
agency
but
a
private
corporation
that
had
been
ordered
to
merge
or
divest
itself
of
certain
investments
or
something
like
that.
would
a
member
of
the
board
of
directors
have
a
first
amendment
right
not
to
vote
against
that
proposal
being
ordered
by
a
court?
justice
stevens
you're
talking
about
a
vote.
he
just
has
to
say
yes
or
no
on
the
vote.
he
can
say
anything
he
wants
to
about
how
he
feels
about
the
vote.
but
the
only
speech
involved,
as
i
understand,
is
either
the
word
yes
or
the
word
no
when
they
call
role.
justice
stevens
and
i
don't
know
why
that
speech
is
any
different
than
the
director
of
a
private
corporation
who
doesn't
want
to
divest
itself
of
its
holdings
in
south
african
companies
or
something
like
that.
why
couldn't
that
person
also
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
say
i
will
vote
against
it
even
if
the
judge
tells
me
to?
