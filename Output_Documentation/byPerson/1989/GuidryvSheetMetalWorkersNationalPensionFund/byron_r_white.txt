so...
and
did
you
call
that
to
the
attention
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
your
judgment,
you
defend
their
opinion?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
don't...
you're
not
here
defending
that
rationale?
justice
byron
r.
white
you're...
you're
presenting
another
ground
for
affirmance?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
their
position
with
respect
to
this
getting
to
the
pension
fund
is
a
little
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
i'm
asking
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
it
does.
suppose
it...
suppose
it
brings...
it
wants
to
recover
the
money,
and
so
it
brings
a
suit
to
recover
the
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
can
it...
can
they
attach
his
benefits
from
a
pension
fund?
justice
byron
r.
white
after
all,
the
only
reason
for
the
embezzlement
statute
is
to...
is
to
prevent
embezzling
from
the
government.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
why...
if
they
can't
recover,
i
don't
know
why
the
union
should
be
able
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
the
rule
if...
if...
if
a...
there's
a
beneficiary
of
a...
of
a
spendthrift
trust
works
for
a
bank
but
he
likes
to
steal
so
he
steals
from
the
bank,
too,
and
the
bank
wants
to
get
the
money
back.
can
they
get
at...
break
the
spendthrift
provision?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
can
or
they
cannot?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
you
mean
some
people
say
the
bank
could
break
the
spendthrift
trust?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
others
say
not?
what's
the
majority
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
your
opposition's
position
is
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
he
stole
it
from
the
pension
fund
or
anyplace
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
procedures
to
execute
your
judgment,
i
suppose
you
can
haul
him
in,
haul
him
into
court
and
ask
him...
find
out
what
his
assets
are
and
things
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
can
you
get
an
order
to
pay
over
to...
as
soon
as
he
gets
the
money,
can
you
get
an
order
to
have
him
to
pay
it
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
a
runaround
in
the
anti-alienation--
