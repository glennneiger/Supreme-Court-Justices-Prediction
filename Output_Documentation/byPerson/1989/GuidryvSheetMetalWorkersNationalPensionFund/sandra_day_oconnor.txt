mr.
silverman,
can
federal
taxes
be
taken
out
of
his
share
of
the
pension
fund?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
tenth
circuit
assumed
that
the
embezzlement
of
funds
was
from
the
pension
fund
itself.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
solicitor
general
says
that
isn't
so,
that
the
embezzlement
was
only
of
the
union's
funds.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did...
did
the
respondent
raise
this
argument
based
on
the
lmrda
provision
in
the
lower
courts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and...
and
you
sought
recovery
under
lmrda?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
funds
we're
talking
about
now
were
funds
taken
from
the
union,
not
the
pension
funds?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
for
purposes
of
our
discussion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
the
union
gotten
any
of
its
money
back?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
much
is...
is
missing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
goldhammer,
i
take
it
as
a
creditor
you
can
get
money
as
it's
paid
out
up
to
75
percent
of
it;
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when
the
benefits
are
actually
paid
out
on
a
monthly
basis
and
in
the
hands
of
mr.
guidry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
when
they're
paid
out?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
the
money
had
been
stolen
from
the
pension
fund
itself?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
