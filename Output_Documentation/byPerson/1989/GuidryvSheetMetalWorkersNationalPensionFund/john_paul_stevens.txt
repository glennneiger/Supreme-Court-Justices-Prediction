justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
at
that
point,
do
you
agree
that
he
violated
the
lmrda
statute?
i'm
interested
in
the
argument
that
respondent
makes
that
the
tenth
circuit
didn't
really
rely
on
the
relief
under
that
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
your
statutory.
supposing
before
erisa
was
enacted
you
had
a
trust
of
this
kind
administered
by
in
this
way,
and
a
fiduciary
of
the
trust
violated
the
lmrda
statute
and
there
were
spendthrift
provisions
in
the
trust
which
would
normally
be
enforceable
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
would
you
not
agree
that
in
enforcing
the
federal
statute
that
the
federal
judge
could
order
relief
that
overcome
the
state
law
obstacle?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
no,
that's
right.
it
would
seem
to
follow
that
if
it
could
not
overcome...
i'm...
i
just
wasn't
aware
of
that
case.
is
that
a...
a
circuit
court
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
it.
i
mean,
if
that
case
is
right,
your
argument
would
follow.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that...
that
provision
merely
is
something
that
has
to
be
included
in
order
to
meet
the
tax...
requirements,
and
it
merely
requires
that
that
clause
be
in
the
instrument.
it
doesn't
really
say
anything
about
the
enforceability
of
the
clause
in
a
situation
like
this,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i
still
think
it's...
maybe
i
misread
it.
but
all
it
says
is
that...
that
the
trust
instrument
must
contain
such
a
provision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
adds
anything
to
the
fact
that...
i
mean,
it
doesn't
really
answer
the
question.
when
a
trust
instrument
has
that
kind
of
a
provision,
is
it...
is
it
subject
to
having...
to
an
exception
such
as
was
imposed
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
agree
with
you.
i
understand
your
statutory
argument.
but
all
i'm
saying
is
i'm
not
sure
the
regulation
really
adds
any
force
to
your
statutory
argument.
that's
really
all
i'm
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
a
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--about
the
lmrda?
there
were
three
trusts
involved,
and
is
it
correct
that
he
was
a
fiduciary
of
only
one
of
the
three?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
to
the
two
of
which
he
was
not
a
trustee,
did
you
assert
an
lmrda
claim
as
to
those?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
asserts
a
violation
of
his--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
violation
of
his
duties
as
a
union
officer,
not
as
a
fiduciary
of
the
trust?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
are
not
claiming,
you
are
not
in
this
argument
at
least,
you
are
not
relying
on
a
claim
that
a
breach
of
his
fiduciary
obligations
as
a
trustee
of
two
of
the
four
funds
is
what
justifies
this
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
correct
that
insofar
as
you
sought
relief
from
the
fund
of
which
he
was
a
trustee,
whether
it's
one
or
two,
that
that
claim
has
been
satisfied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
a
lot
easier
for
me
if
i
got
a
yes
or
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
seem...
i
got
the
impression
from
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
got
the
impression
from
your
opponent
that
it
had
been
satisfied,
and
i
want
to
be
sure
i'm
not
misled.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand,
but
the
two
things
that
are...
do
characterize
the
claims
that,
at
least
the
main
portion
of
what
remain,
is,
one,
he
was
an
officer
of
the
union,
and
the
union
was
his
employer.
i
mean,
it's
both
that
he
breached
duties
that
he
owed
under
the
statute,
and,
secondly,
his
status
as
an
employee
of
the
union
makes
it
fit
within
some
of
these
other
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
rely
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
it
doesn't
for
the
lmrda,
but
i'm
talking
about
some
of
the
other
circuit
court
decisions
have
relied...
have
said
in
effect
that
embezzlement
from
an
employer,
when
that
happens,
when
you
embezzle
from
an
employer,
you
can
get
relief
against
the
erisa
program--
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
you've
agreed
there
should
be
an
exception
for
any
federal
statute
that
authorizes
the
judge
to
grant
x,
y
and
z
relief
and
any
other
appropriate
relief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
rico,
the
sherman
act,
all
sorts
of
statutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no,
that
isn't
true
here
because
the
statute,
lmrda
would
at
the
very
least
authorize
a
judgment
against
your
adversary.
maybe
you
couldn't
collect
it
from
this
particular
pool
of
assets,
but
you're
not
totally
frustrating
the
purposes
of
landrum-griffin.
justice
john
paul
stevens
apart
from...
just
going
back
to
justice
white's
question,
at
common
law,
before
we
had
all
these
statutes,
what
would
the
answer
have
been
in
his
hypothetical?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
the
boyle
case
is
not
a
typical
common
law
case.
that's
also
got...
had
the
landrum-griffin
involved
and
so
forth.
i
was
really
asking,
let's
say,
in
the
nineteenth
century
the
old
cases
on
just
breaking
spendthrift
trusts.
you
say
the
general
rule
was
that
if
it
would...
that
a
tort
judgment
creditor
could
invade
the
trust
notwithstanding
the
spendthrift?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
making
the...
professor
scott
making
the
argument
that
they
should
never
have
been
subjected,
is
that
the
same
as
saying
that
was
the
law
at
common
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay,
thank
you.
