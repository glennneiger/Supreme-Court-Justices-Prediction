mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
district
court
curtis
guidry
stipulated
that
his
former
employer,
the
union,
was
entitled
to
a
judgment
in
the
amount
of
$275,000
because
of
theft
by
mr.
guidry
from
his
union
employer.
he,
however,
opposed
any
taking
of
this
three
separate
pension
funds
based
on
the
anti-alienation
clause
in
the
employee
retirement
security
income
act
of
1974,
which
is
also
known
as
erisa.
the
distric'
court
imposed
the
constructive
trust,
indicating
that
it
was
creating
only
a
narrow
exception
for
mr.
guidry
and
in
favor
of
the
union
to
redress
the
theft
of
union
employer
funds.
the
tenth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
choosing
between
conflicting
circuits,
and
chose
to
follow
that
line
of
cases
that
say
that
federal
courts
have
inherent
equitable
common
law
powers
to
create
exceptions
to
a
congressional
enactment.
the
tenth
circuit
also
recognized
on
the
alternative
argument
of
mr.
guidry
that
a
constructive
trust
was
a
garnishment
within
the
consumer
credit
protection
act,
which
meant
that
he
would
be
entitled
to
75
percent
as
an
exemption.
however,
the
tenth
circuit
held
mr.
guidry
failed
to
preserve
that
right.
today
i
will
make
three
major
arguments.
the
first
is
that
congress
created
the
anti-alienation
clause
in
erisa
with
its
own
three
narrow
exceptions,
none
of
which
are
applicable
here.
under
separation
of
powers,
it
is
congress,
not
the
courts,
that
should
make
any
changes
to
erisa.
second,
the
creation
of
a
special
exemption
for
the
union
based
on
federal
labor
law
would
effectively
gut
the
anti-alienation
clause
because
any
other
judgment
creditor
of
a
federal
cause
of
action
would
also
say
that
its
judgment
was
claimed
to
be
impaired
by
the
anti-alienation
clause.
lastly,
in
the
event
that
you
find
that
the
constructive
trust
was
properly
imposed,
mr.
guidry
is
entitled
to
at
least
75
percent
of
his
pension
under
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
because
a
constructive
trust
clearly
fits
within
the
definition
of
garnishment.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
why
do
i
say
at
least?
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
i
should
say
75
percent.
there
is
no
quantification.
it's
exactly
that
figure.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
no.
as
to
the--
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
--i
imagine.
what
i'm
actually
arguing
is
that
he's
entitled
under
the
erisa
to
100
percent,
so
i'm
arguing
in
the
alternative
that
if
you
don't
accept
the
first
argument
of
100,
then
he
deserves
75
percent.
as
to
the
first
argument,
after
almost
a
decade
of
study,
congress
passed
erisa.
this
court
has
repeatedly
called
erisa
a
comprehensive
and
reticulated
statute.
in
fact,
it
has
six
subtitles.
it
has
over
150
subsections,
not...
not
counting
other
intricate
sections.
among
one
of
the
interrelated
provisions
is
the
anti-alienation
clause
in
section
1056(d),
which
is
clear-cut
and
straightforward.
the
concept
of
anti-alienation
is
not
new
to
federal
law
in
erisa.
strong
anti-alienation
causes
have
predated
erisa,
such
as
in
the
civil
service
retirement
act,
the
social
security
act,
the
railroad
retirement
act
and
others.
congress
has
shown
that
it
can
create
its
own
exceptions
to
erisa
by
initially
in
the
first
act
legislating
two
narrow
exceptions
and
then
in
1984
legislating
a
third,
none
of
which
are
claimed
to
be
applicable
here.
in
enacting
an
anti-alienation
clause,
congress
chose
between
competing
social
principles.
in
enacting
the
clause,
congress
decided
that
no
matter
how
deserving
a
judgment
creditor,
how
egregious
an
action
of
the
judgment
debtor
was,
that
pension
funds
could
not
be
touched.
this
is
not
unusual
either,
because
both
state
and
federal
legislatures
historically
have
provided
exemption
laws.
take
the
homestead
exemption
which
has
been
historical.
take
the
tools
of
the
trade
exemption.
a
pension
is
a
tool
of
the
trade
of
a
retired
person.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
under
a
special
federal
statute
in
the
irs,
yes.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
correct.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
that
has
been
a
misinterpreted
fact,
and
we
say
the
same
thing.
in
fact,
the
action...
there
were
competing
claims
in
the
district
court,
and,
in
fact,
mr.
guidry
was
only
fiduciary
of
one
of
the
three
plans,
the
local
9
plan.
he
wasn't
a
fiduciary
of
the
two
national
pension
plans.
as
to
that
one
plan,
there
was
a
state
court
action.
he
settled
it
before
this
instant
case,
and
there
was
a
release
given
to
him,
and
the
pension
resumed.
so
he
basically
upheld
his
anti-alienation
rights
in
that
state
court
action.
the
union
then
started
a
separate
action,
brought
in
the
pension
funds.
they
came
in
in
different
ways
below.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
not
exactly.
it
was
raised
by
the
district
judge.
he...
when
he
went
and
said
in
pari
materia
to
create
a
narrow
exception,
he
did
cite
the
lmrda
and
said
i
think
it's
in
pari
materia.
and
as
we've
argued,
in
pari
materia
means
statutes
of
the
same
subject
matter.
if
you
have
to
get
to
judicial
construction,
we
would
argue
that
the
same
subject
matter
of
anti-alienation
is
anti-alienation,
and
those
are
found
in
the
civil
service
and
in
other
federal
acts
which
have
mandated
exemptions.
so
we
think
lmrda
talks
about
a
substantive
right
perhaps,
whereas
there's
another
substantive
right
in
erisa;
namely,
an
exemption.
but
you
can
still
get
your
judgment;
you
just
can't
collect
it
against
the
pensions.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
correct.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
correct.
the
first
two
were
that
you
could
voluntarily
and
revocably
assign
10
percent
of
your
benefits.
the
second
and
the
initial
legislation
was
if
you
borrowed
from
the
plan
you
could
secure
it
with
your
benefits,
and
then
in
'84
congress
allowed
the
qdro,
qualified
domestic
relations
order,
to
further
the
purpose
of
the
act
so
that
divorced
people,
divorced
spouses
and
children,
were
also
included
within
the
rights
of
erisa.
so
they
have...
congress
has
clearly
thought
about
it,
and
this
court
has
cautioned
in
other
cases
of
erisa
against
assuming
that
congress
unintentionally
omitted
something.
that
was
in
massachusetts
mutual
v.
russell.
there
was
a
caution
of
this
court
to
assume
that
there
is
an
additional
remedy
within
this
very
complex
interrelated
statute.
i
today
represent...
as
i
had
mentioned
earlier
we
view
the
pension
as
an
exemption
similar
to
the
tool
of
the
trade
because,
in
essence,
this
is
how
the
pensioner
supports
his
family,
and
his
family
is
often
innocent
of
any
wrongdoing
in
any
event.
and,
of
course,
the
whole
point
of
a
pension
fund
is
not
only
to
provide
for
the
pensioner
but
for
the
dependents.
now
i
do
represent
mr.
guidry
who
did
seek
to
enforce
his
rights.
in
asserting
his
rights,
i
do
not
seek
nor
do
i
need
to
rehabilitate
mr.
guidry.
he
was
convicted.
he
served
a
maximumly
imposed
not
only
fine
but
criminal
sentence,
and
today
at
67
he
is
simply
seeking
a
legal
right
that
anyone
else
who
is
a
judgment
debtor
has
under
the
laws,
whether
under
the
homestead
exemption,
the
tools
of
the
trade
or
the
medical.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
well,
not
under
501(b)
because
they
never
brought
a
501(b)
argument.
so
it's
for
the
first
time
that
they
say
wouldn't
we
fit
within
501(b).
501(b)
says
the
court
should
give
other
appropriate
relief.
it
is
a
broad
general
statement,
and
it
cannot
in
a
view
of
construction
overcome
a
specific
enactment.
they
got
their
relief.
they
got
their
judgment.
they're
frustrated
like
every
other
judgment
creditor
that
they
can't--
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
--respectfully,
i
do
not.
that's
the
very
issue
in
united
mine
workers
v.
tony
boyle
where
there...
it
was
pre-erisa,
and
the
argument
was
made
that
mr.
boyle's
conduct
was
reprehensible,
and
the
court
said
it's
reprehensible.
the
next
argument
was
made,
well,
there's
this
federal
labor
policy
in
the
lmrda.
there,
the
court
ruled
that
lmrda
cannot
overcome
a
lawyer-drawn
spendthrift
clause.
my
argument
is
if
it
can't
overcome
a
lawyer-drawn
spendthrift
clause,
how
can
it
overcome
a
congressionally
drawn
spendthrift
clause.
i'm
calling
it
a
spendthrift
clause--
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
--yes,
it's
a
circuit
court
case.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
well,
it's
a
d.c.
circuit
court
case.
i
can't
appeal
to--
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
--well,
it's...
we
think
it
is
a
proper
ruling,
and
even
if
it
isn't,
the
end
result
of...
let's
say
you
gave--
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
--yes.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
let's
assume--
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
--and
again,
it's
our
argument
you
can't
come
to
this
court
for
the
first
time
and
say
i
wish
i
would
have
brought
a
501(b)
case,
but
let's
give
them
that
and
say
they
bring
it.
if
they
got
a
judgment,
it
would
still
be
for...
it's
a
derivative
suit
that
comes
through
a
union
member,
and
again
we
claim
they
can't
bring
it
because
the
union
always...
already
brought
a
suit.
but
let's
say
they
bring
it.
they
get
a
judgment.
it's
the
same
judgment
they
have
here
for
defalcation
against
an
employer,
not
against
a
union,
and
so
you
have
the
same
bar.
it
all
comes
out
the
same.
it's
a
judgment
though
derivative
in
that
instance.
and
i...
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
the
facts
of
this
case
seem
to...
to...
to
do
get
a
bit
twisted;
that
here
we
have
a
man
who
did
steal
from
his
employer
union
but
not
the
pension
funds.
his
criminal
conviction
was
for
theft
from
the
union.
this
civil
judgment
is
for
theft
from
the
union.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
they
did
say
otherwise.
i
raised
it
in
my
petition
for
rehearing,
but
it
was...
it
was
not
granted.
but
it
wouldn't
change
the
case
at
all
if
they
decided
differently
because
they
followed
st.
paul
fire
&
marine
v.
cox,
which
is
an
employer
embezzlement
case
which
says
federal
courts
have
broad
equitable
powers
and
we
want
to
use
it
here.
in
fact,
the
majority
of
these
cases
that
are
in
dispute
are
all
employer
embezzlement
cases.
so
that
seems
to
be
the
context
in
which
it
arises.
so
it
is
an
error,
and
we
feel
we
have
to
point
it
out,
but
it
wouldn't
change
the
result
from
the
rationale
of
the
tenth
circuit.
the
district
court
in
imposing
the
constructive
trust
and
creating
what
it
called
a
narrow
exception
had
to
rule
in
an
inconsistent
manner.
we
have
two
clauses
that
came
into
play
in
the
district
court:
the
nonforfeiture
clause
and
the
anti-alienation
clause.
the
district
court
followed
those
restrictive
cases,
saying
let
congress
decide
on
the
nonforfeiture
issue.
the
pensions
were
seeking
to
deprive
him
of
a
pension.
mr.
guidry
was
seeking
to
get
his
pension,
and
the
unions
were
saying
give
him
his
pension
but
give
it
to
me.
so
we
had
three
competing
interests
in
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
said
i'm
going
to
follow
those
restrictive
cases;
i'm
not
going
to
create
an
exception
on
the
non-anti-alienation
clause.
but
then
the
court
inconsistently
to
perhaps
fill
a
social
purpose
that
it
saw
or
to
do
what
it
saw
as
good,
it
created
the
so-called
narrow
exception;
and
as
we
all
know,
good
lawyers
will
use
this
narrow
exception
to
create
a
greater
crack
in
the
door
than
we
have
now.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
there
is.
there's
a
treasury
regulation
that
we
believe
is
legislative
in
nature,
that
versus
interpretive--
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
--right
on.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
yes,
we
did.
and
the
reg
is
section
1.401(a)-13(b)(1),
and
it
clearly
says
that
a
trust
is
not--
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
--on
page
3
of
my
brief,
i
put
it
as
statutes
and
regulations
involved.
of
course,
that
comes
up
under
the
treasury
context
because
one
of
the
points
in
the
anti-alienation
clause
is
it
appears
not
only
in
the
treasury
law
and
amendment
to
the
irs,
but
it
also
appears
under
the
labor
portion.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
you
might
say
it,
but
at
least
for
our
purposes
it...
it
goes
ahead
and
says
there
that
in
the
parens
"either
at
law
or
in
equity
cannot
be
alienated
or
subject
to
attachment,
garnishment,
levy
and
execution.
"
and
i
know
we
could
all
make
distinctions
between
those
remedies,
but
it's
like
some
cases
say
we're
doing
a
constructive
garnishment.
others
say
we're
doing
a
constructive
trust.
others
say
we're
doing
equity.
it
comes
out
that
he
doesn't
have
his
pension,
and...
and
he
deserves
his
pension.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
well,
it's...
it
appears
that
the
treasury
regulation
was
given
power
by
the...
congress
to
interpret
it
not
only
for
the
labor
department
but
for
the
treasury
department.
there's
a
separate
provision
in
erisa.
what
you're
reading,
as
you'll
see
in
page
3,
there
is
almost
an
identical
provision
in
the
irs
code
and
in
the
erisa,
and
what
we
have
here
is
that
it
was
just
decided
that
labor
would
not
give
duplicitous
regulations.
as
to--
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
--well,
and
everyone
wants
their
trust
to
be
protected
under
federal
law
from
taxes
or
from
initial--
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
--absolutely
not.
congress...
the
treasury
reg
says
we
won't
qualify
a
plan
taxwise--
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
--unless
you
have
the
provision.
so
if
they
didn't
have
it,
they'd
lose
their
tax,
and
you
can
say
so
what.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
but
erisa
itself
says
something
in
addition.
it
says
plan
benefits
shall
not
be
alienated,
which
is
about
the
same
thing,
i
agree,
but
it--
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
--all
right.
i
wanted
to
point
out
as
an
argument
under--
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
--garnishment.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
well,
the
reason
i
didn't
argue
it
strongly
is
because
my
principal
argument
is
plain
meaning,
and
i
didn't
need
to
go
and
say,
but
look
at
the
treasury
regulation.
that
supports
my
argument.
perhaps
i
should
have,
but
since
i
felt
it
was
plain
and
we
didn't
really
get
that
argument
back
at
us...
the
argument
we
got
back
at
us
is
we
should
have
brought
another
lawsuit
against
you
under
the
lmrda.
we're
not
going
to
support
the
tenth
circuit
and
you
should
lose.
i
would
point
out
the
argument
that
under
the
saving
clause,
if
you
take
it
that
the
saving
clause
somehow
impairs
an
lmrda
judgment
under
section
501(b)
that
they
never
got,
if
you
argue
that,
then
you'd
argue
that
a
judgment
under
the
securities
exchange
act
of
'34,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
would
also
be
impaired
by
the
anti-alienation
clause.
you'd
end
up
with
any
federal
cause
of
action
judgment
creditor
going
right
through
the
anti-alienation
clause,
which
could
not
have
been
the
intention.
as
to
the
last
argument,
in
the
event
the
court
does
uphold
the
constructive
trust
we
have
made
the
alternative
argument
that
under
the
consumer
credit
protection
act
he
is
entitled
to
a
75
percent
exemption.
the
union
employer
in
its
brief
concedes
as
it
does
on
the
constructive
trust
theory
that
it's
not
seeking
to
uphold
the
rationale
of
the
tenth
circuit.
that
rationale
was
that
mr.
guidry
failed
to
claim
the
exemption
by
filing
an
objection
form.
as
the
case
was
set
up,
they
garnished
before
they
got
the
constructive
trust.
the
pensions
denied
they
owed
any
sums
because,
as
i
had
told
you
earlier,
they
wanted
it
forfeited,
so
they
wrote
zero.
under
colorado
law,
you
have
to
calculate
75
percent,
the
garnishee.
well,
the
garnishee,
because
it's
mathematically
impossible,
did
not
calculate
75
percent
of
zero;
therefore,
mr.
guidry
did
not
have...
it
wasn't
right
for
him
to
object.
the
union's
basic
argument
is,
well,
we
need
to
go
back
to
when...
when
it
all
happened
in
the
beginning,
and
whatever
they
argue
they
can't
get
around
the
fact
that
their
cause
of
action
in
the
district
court
invoked
the
equity
arm
of
the
court.
it
said
it
was
an
equitable
remedy.
in
their
brief,
they
admit
a
constructive
trust
is
an
equitable
remedy.
and
earnings
under
ccpa
include
pensions,
and
you
have
to
give
a
75
percent
exemption
at
the
very
least
in
terms
of
use
of
the
ccpa.
a
decision
against
mr.
guidry,
though
satisfying
for
the
particular
moment
and
this
particular
union,
would
not
be
a
step
forward
for
the
vast
number
of
american
workers
who
participate
in
pension
funds
whether
they're
union
members
or
not.
erisa's
anti-alienation
clause
protects
not
only
workers
but
its
often
innocent
spouses
and
dependents.
anti-alienation
is
a
clear
federal
policy
expressed
not
only
in
erisa
but
in
other
acts.
congress
created
the
anti-alienation
clause.
if
it
is
to
be
changed,
congress,
not
the
court,
should
weigh,
deliberate
and
decide.
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
balance.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
i
do.
i
would
like
to
say,
however,
that
i
don't
have
any
formal
rebuttal
but
would
be
glad
to
answer
any
questions.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
that
would
have
been
a
different
case.
that's
the
crawford
case.
mr.
eldon
e.
silverman
and
it
would
be...
i
think
there
i
can
make
an
argument
on
either
side.
you're
asking,
and
i
am
happy
to
make
it,
to,
of
course,
discuss
a
case
that
isn't
here
because
their
judgment,
as
he
admitted.
but
the
argument
that
i
would
make
as
strict
construction
as
to
the
policy
is
that
the
only
way
the
crawford
court
allowed
an
offset...
it
called
it
an
offset
between
the
plan
and
the
individual
as
opposed
to
a
third
party,
the
employer.
even
though
the
employer
has
related
interests
under
section
1103,
plan
benefits
can't
inure
to
the
benefit
of
the
employer.
but
as
to
the
crawford
instance,
the
congress
allowed
the
courts
to
create
a
common
law
remedial
or
equitable
remedy
for
breach
of
fiduciary
duty.
there,
you
would
have
to
confront
the
question
of
how
far
you
take
your
case
of
massachusetts
mutual
v.
russell,
where
that
same
language
about
common
law
creation
within
erisa,
you
did
refuse
to
say
that
congress
left
out
a
remedy.
there,
there
was
a
claim
for
extra-contractual
damages,
for
punitive
damages,
and
the
court
said
don't
assume
congress
left
out
something.
what
you
have
to--
