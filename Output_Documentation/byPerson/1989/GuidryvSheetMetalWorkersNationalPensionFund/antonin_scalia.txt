scalia
you
didn't
mean
entitled
to
at
least.
you
meant
at
least
entitled
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
it's
d.c.
circuit,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
might
say
that
it
does
indicate
at
least
the
treasury's
interpretation
of
what
alienation
would
consist
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
it
would
consist
of
garnishment
and
either
at
law...
and
assignment
either
at
law
or
in
equity
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
adds
federal
enforcement
to
state
law.
that's
a...
that's
a...
that's
a
big
thing
right
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
without
anything
else,
it
would
be
worth
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
so
does...
so
does
employer-employee
relationship
involve
fiduciary,
but
you
don't
want
to
rely
on
those
cases,
and
i
think
why
you
don't
is
because
it's
clear
that
there's
no
less
reason
for
applying
those
cases
and
that
relationship
than
there
is
to
apply
the
union...
the
union
officer
relationship.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i'm
worried
about,
i
mean
my
point
is
i'm
worried
about
making
a
big
hole--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
provision
that
these...
these
trust
funds
are
or
these
retirement
funds
are
not
obtainable
by
judgment
creditors.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
you're
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
worried
that
i'm
worried.
that's
what
you're
worried
about.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
to
say
that
it
doesn't
apply
to
your
case
is
not
to
say
it
has
no
purpose.
i
mean
that's
a
rather
high
standard
to
impose
upon
any
law.
to
say
that
it's
a
law
that
does
nothing
unless
it
helps
your
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
helps
a
lot
of
other
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
typical
case
is
the
one
in
which
the
only
assets
remaining
are
the
assets
that
are...
that
are
under...
under
this
kind
of
an...
of
an
erisa...
entitlement.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
typical
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
this
is...
this
is
only
one
convenient
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know.
what
about
a
embezzlement
statute
that
says
anytime
you
embezzle
money
from
the
federal
government
you're
in
deep
trouble
and
you
can...
and
there's
provision
for
recovering
the
money?
do
you
think
the
united
states
could
attach
these
funds?
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
with...
with
wherever
the
$900,000
he
took
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
where
that
is,
i
guess?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
frittered
it
away.
he
didn't
win.
