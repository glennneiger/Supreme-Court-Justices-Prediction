mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
we
have
before
us
here
is
a
case
that
the
lmrda
was
exactly
designed
to
cover.
and
the
lmrda
has
been
in
this
case
from
the
very
beginning.
the
lmrda
was
the
basis
of
the
district
court's
opinion
in
this
case.
opposing
counsel
quarrels
with
the
district
court's
use
of
the
term
in
pari
materia,
but
what
we
have
here
is
a
case
where
you
have
to--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
brought
complaint
in
the
district
court
for
the
district
of
colorado
in
which
we
alleged
jurisdiction
under
section
501(b)
of
the
lmrda.
the
first
claim
for
relief...
by
the
way,
that's
on
page
29
of
the
joint
appendix.
paragraph
number
1
of
the
complaint
alleges
jurisdiction
under
section
501(b).
so
i
don't
know
where
opposing
counsel
gets
the
idea
that
this
is
not
a
501(b)
case
or
that
we
never
alleged
501(b).
then,
the
first
claim
for
relief
in
the
complaint
alleges
breach
of
fiduciary
duties
under
section
501
of
erisa...
of
the
lmrda,
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act,
which
is
29
united
states
code,
section
501.
the
lmrda
has
been
in
this
case
from
day
one.
it
was
the
basis
of
the
district
court's
opinion.
it's
been
here
all
along.
it
is
the
essence
of
this
case,
and
the
fact
that
the
tenth
circuit
did
not...
i
take
chief
responsibility
for
not
being
persuasiveness...
persuasive
enough
in
my
arguments
to...
to
the
tenth
circuit
for
them
to
rely
upon
it.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
well,
i
defend
the...
the
result
of
their
opinion.
there
are
two
major
aspects
of
it
that
i
have
problems
with.
one
of
the
problems--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--i'm
not
really
defending
that
rationale--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--i
am...
i
am
presenting
another,
more
persuasive
ground
for
affirmance
in...
in
some
respects
at
least,
in
many
respects
at
least.
this...
this
is
the
type
of
case
that
was
exactly
designed
to
be
covered
under
the
lmrda.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
there
were
actually...
yes,
that's
true.
three
pension
trusts
and
a
welfare
trust
that
he
stole
some
money
from.
he
was
pensioned...
he
was
a
trustee
out
of...
of
two
out
of
the
four.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
well,
the
lmrda
claim
doesn't
assert
stealing
in
particular
from
pension
funds.
it
asserts--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--stealing
from
unions.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
exactly.
section
501
specifically
creates
fiduciary
duties
for
union
officers.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
and
they--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--well,
we're
in
a
sense
relying
on
both;
but
primarily,
primarily,
we
are
relying
on
the
fact
that
he
breached
his
fiduciary
duties
to
the
union.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
no,
that
claim
has...
oh...
ah,
what
happened
here
was
that--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--yeah,
and--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--insofar
as...
let
me
make
sure--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--okay.
insofar
as
that
trust
fund
claims
against
him,
he
has
been
released
by
that
trust
fund
for
any
liability
to
that
trust
fund.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
and
the
facts
of
this
case
are
very
complicated,
and
the
reason
why
they're
complicated
is
because
mr.
guidry
made
them
complicated.
the
way
in
which
he
stole
money
was
very
complicated.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
the
fact
that
he
was
an
employee
of
the
union
makes
no
difference
in
this
case.
the
lmrda--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--imposes--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--right,
and
we
don't
rely
on
those
cases
either.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
we
don't
rely
on
the
cox
case.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
okay.
but
we
rely--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--on
the
fact
that
he
was
a
union
officer.
mr.
guidry...
and
in
fact
in
many
unions
the
rank
and
filers
are
the
officers
of
the
union.
they
aren't
employed
by
the
union
in
any
sense,
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
the
fact
that
mr.
guidry
was
employed
by
the
union
really
has
no
major
part
in
this
case.
the
fact
that
he
was
a
union
officer
is
the
key...
key
thing.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
well--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--for
purposes
of
our
discussion,
yes.
and
i'm
giving
you
a
yes
answer
to
that
question
just
so
you
don't
misunderstand
me.
but
it's
also
important
for
you
to
understand
that
mr.
guidry's
schemes
of
embezzlement
involved
these
pension
funds
very
directly
and
it...
to
a
very
great
degree,
and
this
is
the
way
he
did
it.
money
passed
between
the
pension
funds
and
the
union.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
union
performed
clerical
services
for
the
pension
funds.
and
mr.
guidry
would
steal
them
while
they
were
in
transit,
and
then
nobody
could
figure
out
who
he
stole
the
money
from.
and
i'm
terribly
sorry
that
i
have
to
give
you
evasive
or
ambiguous
answers
about
where
the
money
was
stolen
from.
what?
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
yeah.
but...
but...
but
what's
going
on
here
is
that
mr.
guidry
has
created
these
complexities,
and
now
he
relies
on
these
complexities
in
order
to
thwart
the
union's
attempt
to
get
his
money
back.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
no,
not
one
penny.
even
though
mr.
guidry
has
indicated
that
he's
very
sorry.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
well,
we...
our
judgment
is
for
$275,000.
the...
the
audit
that
was
done
in
1981
by
arthur
young
and
company
showed
that
practically
a
million
dollars,
$998,000
and
change,
was
missing
from
the
union
at
that
time.
and
what
was
happening
is
that
during
the
period
at
least
we
know
from
early
1970
up
through
september
of
1981,
mr.
guidry
was
stealing
from
the
union
on
a
month-by-month-by-month
basis,
every
single
month.
in
the
criminal
case
it
was
documented
in
the
prosecutor's
statement
that
between
april
of
'77
and
the
end
of
september
of
'81,
mr.
guidry
stole
on
75
separate
occasions.
this
is
the
kind
of--
so,
what
we
have
here
is
a...
an
lmrda
case,
and
it's
also
a
state
law
case.
you'll
notice
in
the
complaint
that
we
also
went
ahead
and
claimed
four
claims
for
relief
under
state
law.
so
you
might
ask
the
question,
what
was
the
congress
doing
in
enacting
the
lmrda
if
the
types
of...
of
conduct
which
they
were
trying
to
proscribe
in
the
lmrda
was
also
covered
under
state
law.
in
colorado
we
have
laws
against
embezzlement
and
theft
and
conversion,
and
all
of
those
are
pled
in
the
complaint.
so
what
was
going
on
here
is
that
union
officers,
union
officers
in
the
1950s
and
before
that,
the
jimmy
hoffas,
the
dave
becks,
the
people
who
are
the
most
ignominious
names
in
labor
history,
were
stealing
from
unions
and
not
paying
the
money
back.
and
they
found
a
way
under
state
law
to
avoid
paying
money
back.
and
what
the
lmrda
is
all
about
is
you
got
to
pay
it
back.
it's
a
restitutionary
statute.
what
it
adds
to
state
law
is
you
got
to
pay
it
back.
it's
a
federal
law,
first
of
all.
it
gives
the
federal
powers
and
the
federal
authorities--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--yes.
it
adds
federal--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--that's
right,
but
it
went
further.
it
incorporated
state
fiduciary
laws
in
section
501(a),
which
means
fiduciary
means
equitable
remedies.
what
you're
talking
about
here
is
broadening
the
scope
of
remedies.
senator
goldwater--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--well,
there...
there
are
some
employer-employee
relations
are
fiduciary
relations,
and
some
may
not
be.
but...
but
i--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--absolutely.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
absolutely.
and
we're
worried
about
the
same
thing--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--and
that's
why
we're
not
relying
on
those
cases.
[laughter]
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
exactly.
i
somehow
had
a
feeling
you'd
be
worried.
and...
and
so
what
we
did
here
was
we
say,
you
know,
this
is
an
lmrda
case,
first
of
all;
and
second
of
all,
you
then...
you've
got
section
514(d)
of
erisa
which
says
that
although
erisa
preempts...
actually
in
514(a)
it
says
erisa
preempts
state
law.
it
says
that
erisa
shall
not
impair,
supersede,
modify,
amend,
do
anything
to...
it
doesn't
say
that.
but
the
overall
picture
here
is
not
to
affect
other
federal
laws,
and
that's
the
important
point
about
federalizing
the
fiduciary
relationship
in
the
lmrda.
so
what
does
the
other
side
do
with
514(d)?
they
don't
mention
it.
and...
but
there
is
also
the
argument
that
if
you
apply
514(d)
in
this
case,
then
you
open
up
the,
you
know,
the
floodgates
again
because
then
every
other
federal
judgment
will
be
taken
in
by
this,
and
anybody
who
has
a
federal
judgment
can
overcome
the
anti-alienation
provision.
wrong.
not
every
federal
judgment
is
based
upon
a
statute
like
the
lmrda.
the
lmrda
is
remedies,
remedies,
remedies.
that's
what
it's
all
about.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
well,
to
the
extent
that
they
were
exclusively
created
for
the
purpose,
i
must
confess,
your
honor,
that
my
malpractice
insurance
doesn't
cover
securities
law
and,
therefore,
i
know...
what
i
know
about
it
you
can
put
in
a
thimble.
but
to
the
extent
that
those--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--absolutely.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
and
my
response
is
that...
that
the
court
should
approach
those
subjects
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
i
accept
your
characterization
of
the
securities
laws
because
i
know
nothing
about
it,
but
i
accept
your
characterization.
and
to
the
extent
that
the
securities
laws
were
created
as
a
remedial
supplement
to
already
existing
state
laws
to
cover
ground
that
was
already
covered
by
state
law,
then
i
would
argue
that
there
would
be
an
exception
for
the
securities
laws
as
well.
have
i
answered
your
question?
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
well,
i--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--i'm
not
going
that
far.
i'm
saying
that
what
we
have
here
is
a
case
where
there
would
be
no
reason
for
the
statute's
existence
at
all.
there...
what...
what
the
other
side
seems
to
be
saying
is
that
this
case
is
not--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--well,
in
this
case
there's
no
reason
for
the
existence
of
title
5
except
for
the
fact
that
it
broadens
the
remedial
scope
of
the
statute.
you
know,
we
could
have
gotten
the
same
judgment
under
four
counts
in
the
complaint
stating
state
law.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
yeah.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
no.
my
case
is
the
typical
landrum-griffin
case.
if...
if
landrum-griffin
was
designed
to
cover
anything,
it
was
designed
to
cover
stealing
from
labor
unions,
title
5.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
the
typical
case
is
where--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--where
the
defalcating
union
officer
finds
convenient
ways
to
make
his
assets.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
yes,
and
it's
the
one
we're
dealing
with
here.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
it's
probably
the
most
convenient
way.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
judging
by
the
united
states'
position
with
regard
to
taxes
and
the
fdic--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--so
you're
saying
that
if
the
federal
government--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--i
know,
but
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
question.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
and
you're
saying
that
if
the
federal
government
had
an
embezzlement
statute,
federal
embezzlement--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--uh-hum.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
i...
i--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--yeah,
and...
and--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--right,
and...
and
what...
what
i
would
say
to
that
is
if
you
apply
section
514(b)
strictly,
then
you...
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be
yes,
they
could
recover
out
of
a...
out
of
a
spendthrift
clause.
these
spendthrift
clauses
have
a...
a...
a...
not
a
totally
clear
history.
the
boyle
case,
which
is
the
d.c.
circuit
case
that
we
were
talking
about
earlier,
was
a
case
in
which...
it
was
a
pre-erisa
case
but
it
was
about
a
1977
case
covering
events
in
the
early
'70s,
and
it
was
a
case
basically
in
which
there
was
a
voluntary
spendthrift
trust
provision
in
one
of
these
pension
plans
that
was
voluntarily
agreed
to
by
the
union
that
was
now
trying
to
get
around
it,
and
the
court
basically
said...
the
district
court
in
that
case
basically
said
we're
not
going
to
let
you
get
around
it
because
you
could
have
had...
you
could
have
changed
it.
at
any
time
you
could
have
changed
it.
at
that
time,
the
major
debate
was
whether
spendthrift
clauses
covered
any
torts
whatsoever.
and
so
when
congress
enacted
erisa,
they
brought
the
spendthrift
trust
provision
into
the
federal
arena,
and
at
that
time
they
also
enacted
section
514(d),
and
they
said
that
we're
not
going
to
impair
any
other
federal
law
with
this
whole
statute;
and,
therefore,
if
the
example
that
you
give
is...
is
consistent
with
the...
the
literal
language
erisa
and
with
the
statements
made
and
with
the
entire
purpose
of
erisa.
i...
i
would
like
to
cover
a
couple
of
other
points.
one
is
that...
well,
i...
i
probably
ought
to
go
on
and
talk
about
the
ccpa
argument.
here
again,
we
are
faced
with
harmonizing
the
ccpa
and
the
lmrda.
the
remedy
that
the
court
chose
in
this
case
was
the
constructive
trust,
which
is
an
equitable
remedy.
there's
no
doubt
it's
an
equitable
remedy.
and
what
we
were
arguing
under
the
ccpa
is
that
the
equitable
remedy
they
chose
authorizes
the
court
to
go
back
and
look
at
what...
what
the
source
of
the
earnings
was
and
to
determine
whether
those
earnings
were
obtained
by
fraud.
in
this
case,
mr.
guidry's
earnings
were
obtained
by
fraud.
he
engaged
in
a
long
series
of
fraudulent
activities
against
the
union
which
were
not
disclosed.
the
contributions
were
made
into
the
pension
plans
by
him
when
they
shouldn't
have
been
made
by
him
into
the
pension
plans
because
he
was
committing
fraud
at
the
same
time.
he
was
in
effect
getting
double
compensation
for...
for
his
work
at
the
union,
and
they
were
fraudulently
obtained.
what
the
opponent's
position
is
on
the
ccpa
is
that
the
rather
typical
language
in
that...
in
that
statute
which
prohibits
any
legal
or
equitable
procedure
to
get
at
the
earnings
of
a
person
precludes
the
court
from
engaging
in
that
kind
of
analysis.
in
other
words,
i
guess
what
they're
saying
is
that
if
you
commit
an
outright
theft
of
money
and
put
it
into
a
pension
plan
that
there's
no
way
to
get
at
that
money
anymore.
and
that
is
a
radical
position
for
the
court
to
take.
it
is
not--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--congress
wasn't
radical.
the
language
of
this
statute
is
similar
to
the
language
of...
of
most
anti-alienation
provisions
in
various
statutes,
and
the
common
law
is
that
with
respect
to
homesteads,
with
respect
to
anti-alienations
provisions
in
life
insurance
policies,
that
we're
just
not
going
to
allow
these
little
refuges
for
fraud
that...
that
the...
that
the
common
law...
that
these
equitable
remedies
were
designed
for
the
very
purpose
of
voiding
exemptions
where
that's
necessary
to
avoid
unjust
enrichment.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
well,
the...
the
rule
in
the
cox
case
is
that
they
can.
that's...
that's
the
case
in
which
there
is
a
split--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--there's
a
split
in
the
circuits
on
that.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
the
tenth
in
this
case
and
the
eleventh
say
yes,
you
can.
i
believe
the
second
and
the
sixth
say
no,
you
can't.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
at
common
law
i
think
the
majority
view
was
that
tort
creditors
were
not
covered
by
spendthrift
trust
provision
and
therefore
you
could
get
at
the
money.
that
was
the
argument
in
the
boyle
case.
that
was
the
argument
that
was
being
made
in
the
boyle
case,
and
the
court
said,
well,
we're
not
going
to
get
to
that
question
as
to
whether
tort
causes
of
action
are
covered
under
spendthrift
trust
provisions
because
you
were
the
ones
who
made
the
spendthrift
trust
provision
yourself,
and
you
didn't
provide
any
exception
yourself.
so
that
the
law
clearly
was
that
if
the
spendthrift
provision
was
defined
by
the
agreement
of
the
parties
to...
to
the
pension
agreement--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--right.
and
scott,
on
trusts,
describes
the
reason
for
that.
he
says
that
a
person
who
makes
a
contract
with
another
person
has
the
opportunity
to
investigate
that
person's
credit
rating
and
determine
whether
he's
going
to
have
to
get
at
pensions
in
order
to
satisfy
his
judgment,
whereas
a
person
who's
standing
in
front
of
a
vehicle
who
happens
to
get
knocked
down
by
a
careless
driver
doesn't
have
that
choice
and
that,
therefore,
he
makes
the
strong
argument
that
tort
creditors
at
common
law
should
never
have
been
precluded
from
getting
at
pension--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--it's
my
understanding--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--that
that
is
the
common
law.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
there
is...
there
is
no
question
that
if
mr.
guidry
is
able
to
do
what
he
has
set
out
to
do
in
this
case
that
it
would
case
great
impairment
to
landrum-griffin,
and
it
would
cause
great
impairment
also
to
erisa
itself.
there
is
a
case
which
the
government
was
a
party
in
called
crawford
v.
la
boucherie
bernard
which
establishes
yet
another
exception
to
the
anti-alienation
provision,
one
where
the
money
is
actually
stolen
from
the
trust
fund
itself.
there
are
several
other
exceptions
that
have
been
recognized
by
the
court
for
the
anti-alienation
provision.
we
cite
them
in
the
brief.
one
is...
is
bankruptcy
and
the
question
of
whether
the
pension
fund
becomes
a
part
of
the
bankrupt's
estate.
there
is
a
case
called
fdic
v.
calhoun
and
another
one
in
the
tenth
circuit
called
fdic
v.
farha
in
which
the
fdic
has
contended
that
when
they
come
in
and
take
over
a
bank
that
they
can
invade
the
pension
funds
of
a...
let's
say
the
president
of
the
bank
who
may
owe
money
to
the
bank
in
order
to
satisfy
that
debt.
and
there
have
been
a
number
of
exceptions
at
common
law.
so
the
only
place
to
look
for
these
exceptions
is
not
erisa
itself.
in
fact,
before
erisa
was
amended
to
expressly
authorize
exceptions
for
domestic
relations
orders,
the
courts
had
already
implied
an
exception.
and
what...
what
mr.
guidry
did
here
in
large
measure
was
to
steal
money
from
a
union,
to
steal
some
money
from
the
pension
fund
and
from
a
welfare
fund...
and
by
the
way,
the
fact
that
he
stole
money
from
those
two
entities
is
in
the
record
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
mr.
guidry
himself
entered
into
the
record
a
settlement
agreement
that
he
made,
and
in
that
settlement
agreement
he
confessed
to
a
judgment
of
$205,000
against
the
two
local
funds,
the...
the
welfare
fund
and
the
pension
fund,
but
he
was
left
off
the
hook
for
only
$50,000.
but
we
are
concerned
about
the
fact
that
this
kind
of
activity
is
documented
in
labor
history,
the
very
kind
of
activity
that
mr.
guidry
engaged
in.
in
the
legislative
history
of
landrum-griffin,
dave
beck
is
reputed
to
have
stolen
$400,000,
and
now
they
are
unable
to
get
the
money
back
because
he
is
engaged
in
some
kind
of
subterfuge
to
hide
the
money
away
or
do
whatever.
and
it
will
also
damage
erisa
itself,
because
erisa
is
really
designed
to
protect
pensioners,
and
if
mr.
guidry
can
get
away
from
stealing
money
in
transit
or
from
stealing
money
directly
from
these
trust
funds
and
making
it
so
complicated
that
we
can't
tell
who
he
stole
it
from,
then
that
will
occur
again,
and
we
are
concerned
about
that
in
particular.
we
are
also
concerned
about
the...
the
individuals
who
are
the
victims
of
these
thefts--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--well,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
completely
clear
about
that.
the
crawford
case...
at
least
the
amicus
in
this
case,
the
solicitor
general,
has
taken
the
position,
has
admitted
in
taking
the
position
that
he
supports
the
rule
in
the
crawford
case,
and...
and
so
i'm
not
completely
clear
that
what
my
opponent's
position
would
be
on
it.
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
unions
are
vulnerable
to
these
kinds
of
thefts
because
while
the
members
of
local
9
of
the
sheet
metal
workers
union
are...
are
tremendous
sheet
metal
workers,
they
are
of
necessity
people
who
work
with
their
hands
and
are
unsophisticated
about
financial
affairs
and
that
they
will
lose
if
erisa
is
not
upheld,
the
purposes
of
erisa
is
not
upheld
to...
to
promote
fiduciary
and
honest
conduct.
and
also
if
the
lmrda
is...
if
this
loophole
is
created
in
the
lmrda
to
allow
union
officers
to
put
money
away
in
pension
funds
while
they
know
that
that
money
isn't
really
owed
to
them
because
they've
been
taking
what--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--that
we
can
get?
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
mr.
guidry's
position
is
that
we
can
get
nothing,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
ah,
when
they
are
in
his
hands?
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
ah.
if
they
are
in
a
bank
account,
then
i
think
the
law
is
that
we
can
get
them.
if
they
are
in
a
brown
bag
or
if
they
are
in
switzerland
where
we
can't
get
access
to
them
or
if
they
are
under
mr.
guidry's
mattress
and
we
don't
know
about
it,
then
we
can't
get
anything,
and
mr.
guidry
has
shown
himself
quite
competent--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--well,
the
900,000--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--well,
the
$900,000
it's
pretty
well
documented
was
spent
at
gambling
casinos.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
establishments.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
yes.
he
lost
big.
actually,
the
union
lost
big.
it
was
the
union
that
was
gambling,
not
mr.
guidry.
it's
only
the
problem
is
that
the
union
didn't
know
it.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
sure.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
there's
a
case
in
this
court
called
hisquerdo
v.
hisquerdo
which
said
you
can't
do
that.
in
that
case
there
was
an
anti-alienation
provision--
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
--yes.
that
makes
the
anti-alienation
provision
meaningless.
if
you
want
to
rule
that
we
can
do
that,
we'd
be
more
than
happy
to
accept
that
ruling,
but
you'd
have
to
overrule
hisquerdo
v.
hisquerdo.
mr.
joseph
m.
goldhammer
i'm
mr.
goldhammer.
