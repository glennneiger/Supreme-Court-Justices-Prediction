chief

william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-1105,
curtis
guidry
v.
sheet
metal
workers
national
pension
fund.
mr.
silverman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
the
narrow
exceptions
to
the
anti-alienation
provision
to
which
you
refer,
are
they
contained
in
the...
in
erisa?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we
don't
have
to
look
outside
of
erisa
to
decide
what...
what
is
a
provision
that
prohibits
assignment
or
alienation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
regulations
really
just
say
what
the
statute
does
in
about
twice
as
many
words,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
silverman.
mr.
goldhammer,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
certainly
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
the
securities
act,
about
some
other
acts.
they
have
elaborate
provisions
for
remedy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but...
just
a
minute.
wait
until
i
finish
my
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
defending
against
an
argument
that
if
we
accept
your
position
here,
judgments
under
other
federal
laws
would
be
equally
subject
over
a
garnishment.
so
surely
you're
obligated
to
make
some
sort
of
a
response.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
silverman.
mr.
goldhammer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
sorry.
thank
you,
mr.
goldhammer.
mr.
silverman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you
have
answered
the
question,
mr.
silverman.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-1105,
guidry
versus
sheet
metal
workers
national
pension
fund

be
announced
by
