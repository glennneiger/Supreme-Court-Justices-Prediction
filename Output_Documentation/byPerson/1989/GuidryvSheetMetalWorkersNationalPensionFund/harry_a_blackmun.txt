why
do
you
say
at
least?
justice

blackmun
i
thought
i'd
missed
something.
justice
harry

blackmun
the
petitioner,
robert
guidry,
is
a
former
official
of
the
respondent,
union,
and
a
former
trustee
of
the
union’s
pension
plan.
he
pleaded
guilty
to
embezzling
funds
from
the
union
and
has
been
incarcerated.
his
union
employment,
however,
made
him
eligible
for
benefits
from
three
pension
funds.
guidry
filed
suit
in
federal
court
against
the
other
two
plans
when
they
concluded
that
he
had
forfeited
his
rights
to
benefits
because
of
his
criminal
activity.
his
own
union
intervened,
and
it
and
guidry
stipulated
to
the
entry
of
judgment
in
the
union’s
favor.
the
district
court,
however,
rejected
the
contention
that
guidry
had
forfeited
his
right
to
benefits.
it
imposed
a
constructive
trust
in
the
union’s
favor
on
guidry’s
pension
benefits.
in
doing
this,
the
court
concluded
that
a
narrow
exception
to
the
employment
retirement
income
security
act
was
appropriate
where
the
union
and
the
member’s
pension
plans
were
damaged.
the
tenth
circuit
affirmed.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
reverse
that
judgment.
we
hold
that
the
constructive
trust
violated
the
statute’s
prohibition
on
assignment
or
alienation
of
pension
benefits.
a
constructive
trust
remedy
is
prohibited
unless
some
exception
to
the
general
statutory
ban
is
applicable.
it
is
also
inappropriate,
we
feel,
to
approve
any
generalized
equitable
exception
to
erisa’s
anti-alienation
provision.
that
is
a
task
for
congress,
not
the
courts.
this
decision
is
unanimous
except
that
justice
marshall
does
not
join
part
2c
of
the
opinion.
