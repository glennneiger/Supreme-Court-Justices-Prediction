mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
addressing
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
tragic
case,
there
are
quite
briefly
two
background
points
that,
based
on
my
study
of
this
record,
i
believe
merit
the
court's
attention.
first,
the
medical
care
providers
in
this
case,
those
who
care
for
nancy
at
mount
vernon,
are
not
in
agreement
with
the
family's
decision.
the
testimony
at
trial
was
clear
and
consistent
that
although
the
medical
care
providers
sympathize
deeply
with
the
family's
plight,
they
respectfully
disagree
with
the
decision
and
many
will
not
participate
in
withdrawing
nutrition
and
hydration.
second,
nancy
cruzan--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no.
it
has
to
do,
among
other
things,
justice
stevens,
with
the
mission
of
mount
vernon.
mount
vernon,
the
record
shows,
is
a
facility
dedicated
to
the
care
of
the
chronically
ill,
the
long-term
care
of
the
chronically
ill.
it
is
not
an
acute
care
facility.
it's
entire
mission
is
to
preserve
life...
the
lives
of
those
who
are--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
not.
i
think
not,
because--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--with
respect
to
the
method?
no,
i
think
not,
because
if
i
may,
the
second
aspect
that
the
record
reveals
is
that
nancy
and
other
patients
at
mount
vernon
have,
typically,
a
dnr...
do
not
resuscitate...
order,
applicable
to
them
in
the
event
of
a
cardiac
or
respiratory
arrest.
but
this
facility
has
never
agreed
to
the
withdrawal
of
nutrition
and
hydration,
and
there
is
a
reason
for
that.
there
is
no
consensus
on
this
delicate
issue
in
the
nation.
of
the
states
that
have
living
will
statutes,
18
of
those
states,
ranging
geographically
from
maine
to
arizona,
draw
a
distinction
between
nutrition
and
hydration,
on
the
one
hand,
and
other
forms
of
treatment
or
care.
so,
too,
congress
has
drawn
that
distinction
in
the
child
abuse
amendments
of
1988,
and
as
the
missouri
supreme
court
noted,
the
distinction
is
seen
quite
poignantly
in
the
actions
a
decade
ago,
in
the
celebrated
case
of
karen
ann
quinlan.
in
that
tragic
case,
karen's
parents
secured
judicial
permission
in
new
jersey
to
withdraw
karen's
respirator.
it
was
thought
that
she
was
respirator-dependent,
but
she
was
not.
they
refused,
however,
to
withdraw
her
nourishment.
the
parents
believed
that
that
presented
different
moral
issues.
and
these
facts
place,
in
my
judgment,
in
very
sharp
relief
the
probate
court's
order
in
this
case,
which
is
what
was
before
the
missouri
supreme
court.
that
order
directs
a
long-term
care
facility,
on
pain
of
civil
liability,
to
take
the
action
of
withdrawing
food
and
drink
from
a
patient
who
came
there
ten
months
after
this
accident,
when
she
was
known
to
be
in
a
persistent
vegetative
state
and
was
given
to
the
care
of
mount
vernon
for
the
long
term.
that
is
the
context
of
the
missouri
supreme
court's
opinion.
now,
as
to
the
constitutional
issues
before
the
court,
we
believe
that
in
this
highly
sensitive
and
deeply
vexing
area,
that
the
due
process
clause
should
not
be
interpreted
to
force
the
states
and
the
federal
government,
with
its
many
health-care
facilities,
to
embrace
a
particular
procedure
or
approach
to
the
treatment
or
care
of
incompetent
persons.
to
the
contrary,
we
believe
that
the
due
process
clause
should
be
interpreted
to
provide
the
states
and
the
federal
government
with
wide
latitude
that...
wide
latitude
to
develop
approaches
that
reflect
reasonably
the
values
of
the
people,
that
states
should
not
be
forced
to
use
the
massachusetts
model,
which
missouri
has
now
embraced,
a
model
of
active
state
judicial
involvement
through
a
probate
judge.
nor,
on
the
other
hand,
should
they
be
forced
to
use
the
minnesota
model
or
the
arizona
model.
those...
in
those
models,
the
court
is
ordinarily
not
involved
and
these
matters
are
entrusted
to
the
decision
of
the
health
care
providers
and
to
the
families.
the
standard,
we
believe,
that
should
guide
this
difficult
area,
is
that
of
reasonableness.
is
the
governmental
approach,
or
regulation,
or
regime,
reasonably
designed
to
serve
a
legitimate
state
interest?
and
on
the
evidentiary
standard,
what
the
missouri
supreme
court
did
here
was
to
follow
the
new
york
approach.
if
one
reads
the
new
york
opinions,
as
i
have,
in
in
re
eichner
and
most
recently,
in
1988,
in
the
westchester
county
hospital
case,
one
sees
there
precisely
the
same
evidentiary
standard
with
respect
to
the
patient's
intent,
and
this
kind
of
decision
will
not
be
honored
in
new
york
with
respect
to
withdrawing
nutrition
and
hydration
in
the
absence
of
clear
and
convincing
proof
of
the
patient's
intent.
that
was
also
the
approach
of
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
course...
court
in
the
brophy
case.
there,
they
concluded
that
the
evidence
was
powerful
in
paul
brophy's
case.
so,
too,
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
in
in
re
eichner,
concluded
that
the
evidence
was
powerful
there.
but
i
believe,
based
on
my
review
of
the
record
in
this
case,
that
this
case
may
very
well
have
been
decided
precisely
the
same
way
in
both
new
york
and
massachusetts.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct,
as
a
matter
of
common
law
right,
and
that
is
my
reading
of
the
missouri
supreme
court's
opinion.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
think
there
are
significant
limitations
that
the
state
could
properly,
constitutionally
place
on
any
such
decision.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
i'm
sorry.
the
state
could
very
well
require,
before...
before
any
such
decision
was
made,
any
number
of
steps
to
be
taken.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
but
could
there
be
an
absolute
rule?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
would
raise
very
difficult
questions,
and
i'm
not
prepared--
[laughter]
--and
i'm
not
prepared
to
answer
that
authoritatively,
definitively.
it's
certainly
not
presented
here,
and
this
court
should
not
be
distressed--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--by
the
question
because
of
the
common
law
right
recognized
in
missouri.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
i
think
if
in
fact
the
state
was
conducting
itself
in
what
reasonable
judges
viewed
as
an
oppressive
way--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--then
yes,
the
federal
constitution
would
speak
to
that.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
i
think
not.
if
the
patient
is
in
severe
pain,
i
would
view
that
as
an
oppressive
action.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
would
distinguish
between
pain
and
suffering,
as
i
think
the
medical
community
and
ethical
community
does.
pain
is
one
thing
that
may
very
well
be
remedied
by
nonheroic,
non-particularly
invasive
measures.
suffering
is
quite
a
different
matter.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
if
there
is
a
condition
of
suffering,
and
the
state--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--is
requiring
the
individual--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
yes,
i
think
the...
the
constitution
is
implicated.
i
did
not
want
to
provide
an
authoritative
answer
to
justice
white.
i
think
it
is...
clearly
is
implicated
in
terms
of
the
significant
liberty
interest
in
being
free
from
unwanted
intrusions.
i
quite
agree
that
it
is
implicated.
