chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
can
that--
--well,
what...
what's
your...
what's
your
standard
for...
for
irrationality?
do
you
mean
it's
an
objective
test;
someone
else
decides
whether
a
person's
particular
decision
is
rational
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
who...
what
does
inappropriate
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does...
does...
does
the
family
have
any
interest
over
and
above
being
kind
of
a
repository
for
what
the
wishes
of
the
patient
are?
in
other
words,
once
the
family
has
said
what
they
have
to
say
about
what
the
patient
might
have
wanted,
does
the
family,
in
your
submission,
have
any
additional
role?
are
their
own
wishes
to...
given
any
particular
regard?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what's
your
answer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
family
does
have
an
interest
over
and
above
what
it
can
say
about
what
the
patient's
wishes
were?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
represent...
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
the
person
is
an
adult
and
not
a
minor...
the
patient?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
colby.
mr.
presson?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
that's
all
we
have
to
decide
is
a
pvs
patient.
would
missouri
law
make
any
distinction
in
that
respect
between
the
fact
that
this
is
just
hydration
and
nutrition,
as
opposed
to
another
kind
of
procedure?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
presson.
thank
you.
