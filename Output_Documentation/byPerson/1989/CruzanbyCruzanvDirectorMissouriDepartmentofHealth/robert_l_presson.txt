mr.
robert
l.
presson
mr.
chief,
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
here
today
to
defend
a
vastly
different
opinion
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
than
has
been
portrayed
by
the
petitioners.
the
respondents
believe
that
the
opinion
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
meant
that
in
this
extraordinary
situation
of
withdrawing
treatment
which
will
inevitably
and
ultimately
lead
to
the
death
of
an
incompetent
ward
of
the
state,
such
a
decision
should
be
made
by
a
judicial
body,
the
most
appropriate
body
in
the
state
of
missouri
being
the
probate
court,
rather
than
the
guardian,
and
that
the
court
can
act
and
make
such
a
decision
in
instances
where
there
is
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
patient,
prior
to
incompetency,
had
given
some
evidence
of
intent
that
that
would
be
the
choice
made
or,
failing
that,
that
there
be
some
evidence
that
it
would
be
unduly
burdensome,
or
that
it
would
otherwise
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
patient
to
do
so.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
presson
the
patient
or
the
family
what,
your
honor,
to
make
the
decision?
mr.
robert
l.
presson
oh.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
no,
i
do
not,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i
believe
under
missouri
law,
the
expense
would
not
be
on
the
family;
it
would
not
be
on
the
guardians.
they
are
not--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--if
it
were
we
would
have
a
different
case,
and
that
might
present
some
problems.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
but,
under
missouri
law,
as
i
understand
it,
the
guardians
are
not
responsible
to
use
their
own
assets
to
care
for
the
ward.
they
would
look
to
the
ward's
own
assets.
that
is,
in
part,
why
the
guardianship
was
entered
into
in
this
case,
so
that
they
could
handle
nancy's
assets,
her
bank
accounts,
receive
medicaid
benefits,
and
whatever
other
assistance
she
might
be
entitled
to.
but
they
are
not
using
their
own
assets
to
care
for
her,
and
i
don't
think
they'd
be
required
to
under
missouri
law.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
well,
the
question
would
be
whether
they
could
be
compelled
as
guardians
with
that
obligation
out
there,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
that
i
think
would
entail
now
an
entirely
different
analysis;
we
would
be
talking
about
whether
that
would
infringe
upon
the
rights
of
a
potential
guardian
to
put
that
sort
of--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--i
would
agree;
that
is
a
separate
question.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i
believe
from
my
reading
of
the
missouri
supreme
court
opinion,
yes,
that
could
happen.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
well,
i
don't
know
that
we
can
be
global
or
totally
exclusive
about
it.
some
factors,
i
think,
were
mentioned
by
the
missouri
supreme
court.
they
did
mention
the
possibility
of
pain,
the
heroic
or
extraordinary
nature
of
the
treatment.
for
instance,
if
a
patient,
such
as
nancy
in
this
case,
were
to
develop
cancer,
whether
they
would
approve
chemotherapy
or
major
surgery.
i
think
it
would
present
an
entirely
different
case
to
them.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i
don't
think,
based
upon
the
supreme
court's
analysis,
it's
just
a
matter
of
dollars
and
cents.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i...
i...
well,
they
certainly
didn't
indicate
that
it
would
be.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
that's
not
the
only...
i
think
they--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--they
indicated
whether
it
would
be
ordinary
or
extraordinary
care.
in
this
instance--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--well,
it
would
be
a
more
invasive
type
procedure.
the
petitioners
have--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--well,
to
me
it
makes
a
difference
because
we
are
talking
about
an
asserted
right...
since
we
disagree,
whether
it
stems
from
the
common
law
or
the
constitution,
but
a
right
to--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--well,
i...
i
submit
there...
the
real
issue
in
the
case
is
really
only
the
procedure,
because
there's
really
no
difference
between
the
substantive
right
found
by
the
missouri
supreme
court--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--well,
the
ultimate
procedure
and
the
ultimate
standard--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--and
i
respond
that
yes,
i
think
that
is
a
possibility--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--not
limited
just
to
pain,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
an
elaborate
procedure,
which
might
be,
as
they
said
in
the
opinion,
heroically
invasive.
i
would
think
it
would
also
be
a
question
of
whether
we
are
talking
about
some
procedure
where
the
effectiveness
is
only
50
percent
versus
something
where
it
is
virtually
99
percent
effective.
whether
you--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--i
think
the
effectiveness--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--well,
it
goes
back
to,
i
think,
the
ultimate
standard
under
the
probate
court,
which...
code,
which
the
missouri
supreme
court
was
operating
under,
is
the
best
interests
of
the
incompetent
ward.
and
i
think
what
they
were
trying
to
do,
in
response
to
specific
claims
that
the
plaintiff
had
brought
before
them
was
identify
objective
factors
that
a
court
should
take
into
account
in
trying
to
make
that
best-interest
determination.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
well,
i
don't
think
we're...
we're
limiting
the
procedure,
which
the
missouri
supreme
court
adopted
here,
to
just
a
pvs
patient,
in
which
they
would
be--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--i
think
the
nature
of
the
procedure
and
the
fact
that
it
is
nutrition
and
hydration,
in
this
case,
becomes
a
relevant
factor.
certainly,
they
indicated,
as
mr.
justice
stevens
indicated,
that
it's
100
percent
effective
for
what
it
is
intended
to
do.
other
forms
of
treatment
might
not
be.
and
it
might
not
be
in
the
best
interest
of
an
incompetent
patient
to
insist
that
they
undergo
such
other
treatment.
so
the
nature
of
the
treatment,
i
think,
and
the
lack
of
any
significant
burdens
was
a
factor
that
the
court
said
is
a
objective
matter
we
can
look
to,
to
see
whether
it
is
in
the
best
interests.
what
i
would
say
is
the
missouri
supreme--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--well,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--well,
we
are
trying
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
what
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
patient
presumably--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--i'm
not
sure
that
the...
the
issue
of
the
state
is
necessarily
formulated
properly
in
terms
of
keeping
her
alive
for
20
years
or
keeping
her
alive
for
30
years.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i
would
submit
this,
justice
stevens,
in
looking
to
the
best
interest
of
the
incompetent
patient,
i
think
the
court
was
indicating
we
must
look
to
some
of
the
same
sorts
of
things
we
would
presume
that
a
patient,
if
competent,
would
look
to
in
making
their
own
decision.
and
they
would
look
to
the
risks
associated.
are
there
going
to
be
significant
side
effects,
is
it
going
to
be
painful?
mr.
robert
l.
presson
well,
we're
talking...
you're
now
talking
about
the
length
of
time,
perhaps,
in
the
state--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--well,
i...
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
how
long
she
will
or
will
not
survive
in
this
state.
and
i
certainly
didn't
mean
to
imply
that
when
i
said
that
the
degree
of
effectiveness
of
a
proposed
treatment
could
be
measured
in
terms
of
the
length
of
years.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
patient
who
is
competent
when
trying
to
decide
between
treatment
alternatives
or
refusing
treatment
would
look
to
what
are
the
risks
here.
is
this
treatment
really
going
to
preserve
my
life,
or
is
it
going--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--i
think
what
the...
the
proper
way
to
phrase
that,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
state...
and...
and
when...
i
mean
state,
i
mean
probate
court,
the
appropriate
decision-making
body
under
the
opinion
below,
can
take
into
account
the
resources
available
to
care
for
the
ward.
whether
that
stems
from
some
state
assistance,
whether
that
stems
from
volunteers,
i
think
that
might
be
a
relevant
consideration.
if
state
law
were
to
change,
to
impose
some
burden
on
the
guardians,
then
that
might
be
a
relevant
consideration.
i
think,
to
look
at
it
more
broadly,
it's
that
the
probate
court
might
take
account
the
resources
which
are
available
to
provide
the
treatment,
which
is
either
proposed
to
be
initiated
or
proposed
to
be
withdrawn.
that
simply
was
not
a
relevant
consideration
in
this
case.
and
the
proper
role
that
that
might
be,
we
can
only
speculate.
i
would
say
this,
the
missouri
supreme
court
decided
only
the
case
before
it,
only
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
facts
and
arguments
which
were
made.
it
did
not
act
legislatively,
and
it
did
not
lay
out
a
judicial
amendment
to
the
probate
code
to
guide
all
future
proceedings.
now,
we
can
glean
some
guidance
from
what
they
have
said.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
that's
the
conclusion
of
the
missouri
supreme
court,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i...
i
think
in
a
nutshell
that's
what
it
does
come
down
to,
justice
white.
this
is
not
a
situation
of
the
state
intruding
as...
as
the
petitioners
keep
saying
because
they
are
not
intruding
or
seeking
to
override
a
competent
choice
made
by
a
fully
competent
adult.
what
we
have
here
is
really
a
procedure
by
which
how
do
we
make
these
decisions
on
behalf
of
someone
who
is
presently
incompetent
to
make
it?
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i
think
that
standard
is
implicit
from
the
probate
code
itself,
your
honor,
and
i
think--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--pardon?
mr.
robert
l.
presson
well,
i
believe
they
indicated
in
response
to
the
specific
arguments
now
that
the
petitioners
made
that
this
was
an
unduly
burdensome,
highly
invasive
procedure
and,
i
guess,
inferentially
against
the
best
interests
of
nancy
cruzan,
they
rejected
that
approach.
but
i
think
the
ultimate
standard
the
missouri
supreme
court
would
be
applying
would
absent--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--well,
i...
i
can
only
say...
i...
i...
i
guess
i
read
it,
perhaps,
in
a
different
context,
the
context
being
the
general
obligation
of
the
probate
code,
and
the
general
obligation
imposed
on
the
guardians
according
to
missouri
law
is
to
act
in
the
best
interests
of
the
incompetent
ward.
i
think
that
is
also--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--i
would...
i
would
submit
that
it
is.
even
if--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--i
believe
that
is
within
missouri's
authority
to
set
that
standard.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i
believe
that
is
also
within
their
authority.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i
won't
say
there's...
there's
no
limitation
at
all,
but
i
don't
see
that
any
decision
the
missouri
supreme
court--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--i
would
think
the
question
would
have
to
be,
justice
o'connor,
what--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--no.
i
would
submit
that
the
question
must
be
addressed,
though,
what
type
of
evidence
from
the
family
we
are
even
talking
about.
it
seems
to
me
to
be
talking
in
the
abstract
that
the
family
is
excluded
or
the
family
is
not
allowing
to
be
heard
really
obscures
more
than
it
illuminates.
i
think
we
would
have
to
first
say
be
heard
on
what
issue.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
the
import.
i
would...
i
would
answer
this
way.
relying
upon
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence
standard,
i
think,
is
a
constitutionally
permissible
option
that
the
missouri
supreme
court
can
adopt.
whether
that
is
imposed
upon
other
states,
should
they
choose
to
make
it,
i
would
submit
they
could
make
constitutionally
other
choices.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
obviously
that
presents
different
issues.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i
think
missouri
could,
as
some
of
the
amici
have
suggested,
for
instance,
exclude...
treat
separately
nutrition
and
hydration.
that
was
not
done
in
this
case.
i
believe--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--well--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--i...
i
believe
the...
the
question
was
could
missouri
exclude
anything
other
than
statements.
if,
for
instance,
the
state
of
missouri
said
we
will
not
allow
anyone,
competent
or
otherwise,
to
refuse
nutrition,
hydration
because
we
think
that
amounts
to...
state-sanctioned
suicide,
i
would
submit
that
that
presents
vastly
different
issues
because
it
is
an
exercise
of
the
state's
police
power.
here
we
are
talking
more
particularly
about
the
state's--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--if
we
are
talking
specifically
about
the
nutrition,
hydration,
i
believe
that
would
be
an
acceptable
choice.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
not
medical
treatment
in
general.
i
would
base
that
on,
i
believe,
that
the
state
could
constitutionally
override
the...
even
a
competent
individual's
choice
to
refuse
food
and
water
because
that,
i
believe,
a
state
could
reasonably
conclude,
went
against
its
interest
in
preventing
suicide
and
would
amount
to
a
state
sanction
of
that.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
well...
but
the
missouri
supreme
court
did
not
make
that
categorical
assumption
in
this
case
regarding
food
and
water.
i
specifically
made
that
argument
before
them,
that
they
should
create
such
a
separate
category
and
treat
it
differently,
and
nowhere
in
their
opinion
do
i
find
that
they
accepted
that
article...
argument.
so,
i
believe
it
is
still
a
possible
choice
in
missouri.
they
did
not
rule
it
out.
they
did
not
rule
out
any
other
types
of
treatment
decisions.
there
was
no
pre-judgment
and,
therefore,
i
think
no
intrusive
state
intervention
here...
what
we
have
is
simply
a
question
of
how
to
decide
on
behalf
of
somebody
who
cannot
decide
for
themselves.
and
is
it
constitutional--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--i
think
the...
when
we
get
down
to
specifics,
maybe
in
certain
instances
that
might
be
an
irrational
choice.
but
i
think
the
state
can
treat
food
and
water,
for
instance,
differently
than
it
does
other
treatment.
the
question,
i
think,
would
be,
justice
kennedy,
as
i
said
in
the
brief--
mr.
robert
l.
presson
--i
have
seen
nancy
cruzan
herself.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
yes.
mr.
robert
l.
presson
i
was
at
the
hospital,
at
mount
vernon
rehabilitation
center.
to
perhaps
get
back
to
your
question,
justice
kennedy,
as
to
whether
or
not
the...
as
i
stated
in
my
brief,
even
though
it's
not
directly
presented,
it
would
seem
to
me
the
state
in
that
instance
might
have
to
engage
in
some
very
delicate
decision-making.
is
this
just
a
desire
to
die,
to
reject
one's
state
of
life,
in
which
case
it
amounts
to
nothing
more
than
suicide,
and
does
the
constitution
require
the
state
to
sanction
and
recognize
that,
or
is
it
a
case--
