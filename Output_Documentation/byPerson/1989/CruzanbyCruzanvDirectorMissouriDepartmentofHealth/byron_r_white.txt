the
individual
isn't
very
competent
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
we...
don't
we
have
to
get
to
that
question
here?
because
the
state
said
that
the
evidence
is
just
insufficient
to
really
know
what
the
patient's
wishes
were.
you
don't
ask
us
to
overturn
that
factual
assessment
of
the
evidence,
do
you,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
lose
on
that,
then
you
must
get
to
the
question
of
the...
of
the
authority
of
the
parents.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you...
you...
the
court
below
said
guardians
just
don't
have
this
kind
of
power.
they
don't
have
that
kind
of
authority
under
the
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
all
you
need
to
do
to
prevail
is
to
say
the
state
is
entitled
to
prefer
another...
another
decision-maker
besides
the
guardian.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
general,
in
new
york,
if
the
evidence
is
clear
and
convincing
with
respect
to
food
and
hydration,
the
choice
would
be
honored?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
state
could
not
say
this
is
tantamount
to
suicide
and
we
may
override
that
choice?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
suppose
the
state
did
say
that
we
just
put
food
and
hydration
in
a
different
category
and
we
never
will
do
it
no
matter
what
the
evidence
is.
what
about
the
due
process
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
one
of
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
the
state
could
not
do
that
under
the
due
process
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know
but
suppose--
justice
byron
r.
white
--suppose
the
state
says,
we're
never
going
to
honor
a
choice
by
the
patient
or
by
the
parents
or
anybody
else
where
food
and
hydration
is
concerned?
would
the
due
process
clause
forbid
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
is
there--
