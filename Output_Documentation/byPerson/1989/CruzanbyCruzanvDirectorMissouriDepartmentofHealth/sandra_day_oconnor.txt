o'connor
mr.
colby,
at
the
time
the
family
said,
yes,
go
ahead
and
insert
the
feeding
tube,
if
they
had
refused
that
permission,
would
the
state
law
have
required
that
refusal
to
be
honored?
was
the
family's
consent
required
at
the
time
for
the
insertion
of
the
tube?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
by
state
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
by
statute
or
by
some
state
common
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
they
refused?
is
there
a
procedure
then,
whereby
the
state
would
go
in
and
have
a
guardian
appointed?
or
does
the
state,
if
the
patient
is
in
a
state
hospital,
simply
accept
that
refusal
and
allow
the
patient
to
die
of
malnutrition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
colby,
do
you
think
that
a
competent
adult
has
an
absolute
constitutional
right
to
refuse
food
and
water?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
if
no
feeding
tube
is
required?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
the...
can
the
adult,
the
competent
adult
absolutely
refuse
food
and
water
in
a
hospital
setting,
and
the
state
can't
override
that
decision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
colby,
in
that
situation,
a
person
acknowledged
to
be
in
a
persistent
vegetative
state,
do
you
think
that
there
is
some
kind
of
per
se
rule,
or
presumption
that
federal...
the
federal
constitution
mandates
be
applied,
that
that
person
would
prefer
to
die?
i
mean,
is
that
your
position?
that
the
state
must,
because
of
the
federal
constitution,
apply
some
kind
of
a
presumption
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
patient
has
an
interest
in
making
sure
that
the
patient's
fundamental
wishes
are
followed,
at
least?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
patient
has
an
interest
in
making
sure
there
is
not
some
erroneous
determination
made--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--about
the
patient.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
federal
constitution,
then,
says
that
the
state
can't
require
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
for
example?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
wait
a
minute.
please,
let's
get
back
to
the
question.
may
a
state,
under
the
federal
constitution,
require
at
least
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
the
patient's
intent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
constitution
requires
a
state
to
allow
the
nearest
relative
to
make
the
decision,
or
can
the
state
require
a
judicial
proceeding
to
make
that
determination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
some
kind
of
independent
decision-making
body,
such
as
we
might
require
to
determine
whether
someone
must
be
committed
to
a
mental
institution
or
that
sort
of--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is
it
enough
if
the
family
members
are
allowed
to
testify
and
state,
as
an
evidentiary
matter,
their
understanding
of
their
daughter's
wishes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
presson,
do
you
think
that
the
state
of
missouri
has
articulated
some
clear
standard
here?
it's
the
best
interests
of
the
patent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
not
what
the
court
said,
though?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
what
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
said?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i...
i'm...
i'm...
i
have
been
concerned
because
in
reading
the
opinion,
it
was
not
clear
to
me
what
the
standard
was
that
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
had
said.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
that
the...
the
objective
of
a
court
review
in
a
situation
like
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
state
says
the
evidence
must
meet
a
clear
and
convincing
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
is
it
within
the
authority
of
the
missouri
court
to
say
that
they
won't
consider
at
all
certain
types
of
evidence
such
as
was
offered
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
is
no
federal
limitation
whatever
on
the
decision
that
a
state
might
make
about
what
evidence
is
relevant
to
the
best
interest
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
it
say
we
will
never
listen
to
evidence
given
by
a
family
member
on
this
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes
or
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
supreme
court...
the
supreme
court
here
said
the
evidence
offered
at
the
hearing
was
inherently
unreliable
and
insufficient.
do
you
think
all
of
that
evidence
should
be
so
characterized?
is
there
any
limit
by
virtue
of
the
federal
constitution
to
that
decision?
