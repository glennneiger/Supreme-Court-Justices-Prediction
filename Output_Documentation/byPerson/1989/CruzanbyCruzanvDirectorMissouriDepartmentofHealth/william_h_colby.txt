mr.
william
h.
colby
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
nancy
cruzan
is
a
32-year-old
missouri
woman
who
is
in
a
persistent
vegetative
state.
persistent
vegetative
state
is
a
specific
clinical
diagnosis
for
a
patient
who
is
permanently
unconscious.
all
thought,
all
memory,
all
ability
to
interact
with
the
world
around
her
in
any
way
is
gone.
it
is
undisputed
in
the
record
below
that
nancy
will
never
recover
from
this
condition
and
will
never
interact
with
the
world
around
her.
she's
been
in
this
condition
for
over
six
years,
the
result
of
a
car
accident.
approximately
three
weeks
after
the
accident,
when
hope
for
her
recovery
remained
strong,
her
parents
and
her
husband
at
the
time
consented
to
the
surgical
insertion
of
a
gastrostomy
tube
necessary
to
feed
nancy.
no
one
told
the
cruzans
at
that
time
that
their
consent
was
irrevocable;
no
one
suggested
to
them
that
the
purpose
of
this
surgical
insertion
of
the
tube
was
to
perpetuate
nancy
in
an
unconscious
state
indefinitely.
mr.
william
h.
colby
i
think
that
is...
is
not
correct.
at
the
time
the
tube
was
inserted,
nancy
had
just
come
out
of
intensive
care.
she
was
being
fed
through...
it's
not
completely
clear
in
the
record,
but
it
appears
both
a
nasogastric
tube
and
through
an
i.v.
tube.
it
was
clear
that
her
long-term
care
was
going
to
require
more
nutrition,
and
the
operational
report
for
the
surgery
stated
that
the
reason
for
the
surgery
was
malnutrition.
after
the
tube
was
inserted,
when
she
transferred
out
of
the
hospital
and
into
the
rehabilitation
center,
they
attempted
to
feed
her
through
mouth
while
she
still
had
the
tube
in
place,
but
they
were
not
able
to
feed
her
sufficiently
to
provide
for
her
needs.
mr.
william
h.
colby
the
family's
consent
was
required
for
the
surgery
to
insert
the
tube.
mr.
william
h.
colby
by
state
law.
it
would
have
been--
mr.
william
h.
colby
--by
common
law.
it
would
have
been
a
battery
for
the
doctor
to
perform
a
surgery
without
consent.
and
the
only
statutory
exception
to
that
in
missouri
is
in
the
event
there
is
an
emergency.
and
that's
defined
in
the
missouri
statute
as
a
person
is
in
imminent
danger
of
dying
and
there
was
no
one
around
to
provide
the
necessary
consent.
mr.
william
h.
colby
it
is
my
belief
that
had
they
refused...
refused,
the
state
would
have
accepted
that
refusal
and
that
nancy
would
have
died
not
from
malnutrition,
but
from
the
severe
brain
damage
from
her
accident
shortly
before
then.
had
the
doctor
advised
the
family--
mr.
william
h.
colby
--the
state
would
not
necessarily
have
to
accept
that
determination,
and
certainly
there
are
instances
like
the
jehovah's
witness
cases
where
the
state
will
intervene
and
take
steps
to...
provide
the
medical
treatment.
my
statement
is
that,
in
this
case,
where
the
parents
would
have
been...
had
a
doctor
come
to
them
and
said,
there's
virtually
no
chance
your
daughter
is
going
to
recover
from
this
car
accident,
we
want
to
do
this
surgery,
we
need
your
consent
to
do
it,
and
the
parents
said,
i
don't
want
to
give
that
consent,
i
don't
think
she's
going
to
recover,
the
doctors
would
have
honored
that
request.
now,
if
the
decision
is
considered
abusive,
if
it's
considered
one
that's
not
among
acceptable
medical
alternatives,
then
the
state
has
an
interest
in
intervening.
the
issue
before
this
case...
before
this
court
today
is
a
narrow
one.
and
it
is
whether
a
state
can
order
a
person
to
receive
invasive
medical
treatment
when
that
order
is
contrary
to
the
wishes
of
the
family,
when
it
overrides
all
available
evidence
about
the
person's
wishes
from
prior
to
the
accident,
when
the
decision
to
forego
treatment
is
among
acceptable
medical
alternatives
and
when
the
state
gives
no
specific
justification
for
that
intrusion
other
than
their
general
interest
in
life.
we
submit
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
liberty
guarantee
there
protects
individuals,
conscious
or
unconscious,
from
such
invasion
by
the
state,
without
any
particularized
interest
for
that
invasion.
mr.
william
h.
colby
i
believe
a
competent
adult
has
an
extremely
strong
right
to
refuse
the
surgery
necessary
to
provide
a
gastrostomy
feeding
tube
when
that
person
has
lost
the
natural
ability
to
swallow.
mr.
william
h.
colby
and
what
would
the
mechanism
be?
mr.
william
h.
colby
there
could
be
situations
where
that
decision
may
be
considered
irrational
or
abusive,
and
the
state
could
override
that...
that
decision,
i
believe.
but
if
we're--
mr.
william
h.
colby
--that
may
well
be
right.
in
the
case
of
suicide,
for
example,
that's
a
situation
where
we
presume
that
the
decision
is
irrational.
and
if
that
person
is
refusing
to
eat,
the
state
may
well
have
a
need
to
override
that
decision.
mr.
william
h.
colby
it
would
be
difficult--
mr.
william
h.
colby
--it
would
be
difficult
for
a
person
to
be
in
a
state
close
to
the
vegetative
state
and...
and
be
competent.
mr.
william
h.
colby
could
that
patient
refuse
surgery
to
insert
a
gastrostomy
tube?
absolutely.
mr.
william
h.
colby
i
believe
they...
they
do
have
an
obligation
and
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
protects
that
person's
right
to
be
free
from
a
state
intrusion.
and
as
long
as
that
decision
is
not
considered
irrational,
then
the
state
does
not
have
a
reason
to
intrude.
mr.
william
h.
colby
there
no
doubt
is
a
continuum,
and
all
kinds
of
decisions
will
be
made
along
that
continuum.
there
will
be
some
situations
where
the
state
is
going
to
have
a
greater
need
to
intervene
where
a
decision
is
going
to
seem
inappropriate.
mr.
william
h.
colby
if,
for
example...
and
take
the
example
of
the
jehovah's
witness
case.
the
decision
is
not
based
on
the
best
interest
of
the
individual,
it's
based
on
the
parents'
religious
belief.
the
medical
community
believes,
in
that
case,
that
a
simple
medical
procedure
will
restore
the
person
to
life
and
give
them
a
full
chance
to
interact
in
society.
that
decision
is
presumed
irrational.
i'm
not
certain
that
there's
any
specific
test,
but
in
this
specific
case,
where
we
have
the
factors
that
nancy
is
in
a
vegetative
state,
that
she's
permanently
unconscious,
that
the
family...
that
her
wishes...
she
said
to
a
friend
a
year
before
this
accident,
"i
wouldn't
want
to
live
life
as
a
vegetable.
"
mr.
william
h.
colby
yes.
mr.
william
h.
colby
certainly,
the
state
has
an
important
interest
in
protecting
life,
and
they
have
an
interest
in
making
certain
that
appropriate
decisions
are
made
about
medical
treatment,
but
to
simply
say
that
in
all
situations
we
are
going
to
err
on
the
side
of
life,
to
say
that
we
have
an
unqualified
interest
in
life
that
is
going
to,
in
essence,
win
in
every
case--
mr.
william
h.
colby
--and
if
the
wishes
of
the
person
cannot
be
determined
with
accuracy,
then
all
that
does
is
get
you
to
the
second
question,
which
is,
if
we
don't
know
for
certain
what
this
person's
wishes
are,
how
are
we
going
to
decide
about
medical
treatment?
is
the
state
going
to
decide
in
every
instance,
or
is
the
patient's
family
going
to
decide
to
be
involved
in
that
decision?
mr.
william
h.
colby
certainly,
in
the
past,
this
court
has,
in
a
situation
where
an
intermediate
appellate
court
has
carved
out
parts
of
the
trial
record
and
look
at
only
specific
facts,
and
in
doing
so
denied
an
important
liberty
interest,
this
court
has
looked
at
the
whole
record
and
i
think
you
can
do
that
here,
and
we
submit
that
there
is
clear
evidence
of
her
wishes.
but
even
assuming
the
evidence
is
unequivocal,
the
standard
that
the
court
below
applied
to
the
evidence
that
they
reviewed...
the
court
below
said
the
only
evidence
we're
going
to
look
at
are
specific
statements
that
nancy
cruzan
made
before
her
accident.
all
of...
other
evidence
that
the
finder
of
fact
relied
on,
we're
disregarding.
and
then
they
took
that
limited
amount
of
evidence
and
they
said
we're...
we
have
in
missouri
an
unqualified
interest
in
life.
we're
applying
to
this
limited
amount
of
evidence
a
standard
that
is
so
high
that
the
state
always
wins.
mr.
william
h.
colby
if
we
lose
on
that,
then
we
get
to
the
question
of,
if
the
evidence
is
unclear,
then
who
decides?
nancy
cruzan
said,
i
hope
my
family
would
know
i
wouldn't
want
to
live
life
as
a
vegetable,
and
she
said
to
her
friend,
that's
important
because
families
get
to
make
these
kinds
of
decisions.
that's
the
kind
of
framework
that
she
thought
she
was
dealing
with.
this
court
has
always
deferred
to
the
special
competence
of
families
to
know
what
values
are
important
to
family
members.
what's
in
nancy's
best
interest,
how
she
lived,
her
value
system--
mr.
william
h.
colby
--because
if
the
state
does
that,
and
it
says
we
are
going
to
intrude
in
every
unconscious
person's
life
if
we
don't
have
express
information
as
to
their
wishes,
then
they're
going
to
deny
important
rights
to
incompetent
people.
at
the
one
end
of
the
spectrum,
if
you
look
at
the
jehovah's
witnesses
there,
nancy
cruzan's
case
must
be
at
the
complete
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
and
that's
the
only
question
before
the
court
today.
a
permanently
unconscious
person,
the
american
medical
association,
the
president's
commission
and,
i
would
submit,
even
the
attorney
general
of
missouri
would
say
that
it's
different
if
you're
permanently
unconscious
and
have
no
hope
of
ever
recovering
consciousness.
mr.
william
h.
colby
there
certainly
is
a
presumption,
your
honor,
that
before
the
state
can
intrude
and
order
that
person
to
receive
medical
treatment
at
the
order
of
the
state
for
the
rest
of
their
life,
that
the
state
has
to
show
some
specific
reason
for
doing
that.
the
state
here
has
showed
no
reason
specific
to
nancy
cruzan
that--
mr.
william
h.
colby
--yes,
absolutely.
mr.
william
h.
colby
agreed.
mr.
william
h.
colby
yes.
mr.
william
h.
colby
as
applied
in
this
case,
i
would
submit
that...
the
state
of
missouri,
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
says
"clear
and
convincing
evidence"
at
only
one
place,
and
at
that
place
they
say,
"clear
and
convincing,
inherently
reliable
evidence.
"
at
four
other
places
in
the
opinion,
the
court
below
says,
we
won't
allow
an
unconscious
person
to
exercise
these
rights
absent
rigid
formalities.
mr.
william
h.
colby
for
a
patient
like
nancy
cruzan,
i
would
submit
that
her
liberty
interest
is
as
important
as
her
right
to
life
in
this
setting.
she
only...
she
has
two
extremely
limited
options.
if
her
right
to
liberty
is
protected,
she
will
not
be
forced
to
live
in
an
unconscious
shell,
in
a
room
with
strangers
attending
her,
for
the
rest
of
her
life.
if
her
right
to
life
is
honored,
then
she
will
exist
in
this
state.
from
everything
we
know
about
nancy's
wishes,
from
everything
her
family
tells
us
about
what
they
know,
because
they're
family,
that
she
would
want,
she
would
choose
liberty.
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
william
h.
colby
--justice
kennedy,
i
believe,
based
on
the
decisions
of
this
court,
that
there
certainly
is
a
liberty
interest
of
people,
conscious
and
unconscious,
to
be
free
from
invasions
of
the
body
that
the
state
has
ordered.
so
if
we
are
trying
to
figure
out...
we
started
with
justice
o'connor's
question...
what
the
proper
burden
of
proof
is
here,
if
you
look
at
the
decisions
in
matthews,
the
decisions
in
santosky,
and
are
trying
to
figure
out
where
the
disutility
of
error
falls,
if
one
right
should
be
respected
substantially
more
than
another
right,
based
on
all
of
the
evidence
in
the
record
below,
if
nancy
cruzan
was
lucid
for
a
moment
and
could
come
before
this
court,
she'd
say
my
liberty
interest
is
more
important--
mr.
william
h.
colby
--and
certainly
my
interest
in
life
doesn't
win
out
over
the
liberty
interest.
mr.
william
h.
colby
even
if
we
assume
that
the
state
sets
a
burden
of
proof
and
that
nancy
cruzan,
the
evidence
below
did
not
meet
this
burden
of
proof,
all
that
does
is
get
us
to
the
second
question
as
to
who...
who
decides
her
medical
treatment
and
who
is
the
appropriate
decision-maker.
mr.
william
h.
colby
the
state--
mr.
william
h.
colby
--the
state
could
certainly
set
up
procedures
to
ensure
that
the
decision
is
carefully
made.
we
don't
dispute
that.
i
don't
believe
that
they
could
remove
the
patient's
family
completely
from
the
decision-making
in
coming
to
a
conclusion.
the...
a
person's
family
knows
information
about
a
person
that
the
state
can't
know.
if
we're
talking
about
choosing
between
two
decision-makers,
and
you
have
the
state,
who
never
knew
nancy
cruzan,
and
her
family,
who
was
with
her
all
of
her
life,
then
it's--
mr.
william
h.
colby
--yes.
i...
that
is
evidence
of
what
the
person
would
want.
the
appellate
court
here
discarded
all
that
evidence.
mr.
william
h.
colby
we
have
not
argued
this
case
from
the
start
as
a
matter
of
her
parents'
rights,
but
certainly
families
have
an
interest
in
making
certain
that
their
family
members
are
treated
appropriately.
mr.
william
h.
colby
yes.
mr.
william
h.
colby
i
think
so.
they
have
an
interest
in
making
certain
that
decisions
are
made
appropriately
for...
family
members
that
they
care
about,
that
they
nurture,
that
they
have
the
responsibility
of
[inaudible].
mr.
william
h.
colby
well,
the
value
of
family
decision-making
is
certainly
not
lost
simply
because
nancy
cruzan
was
25
when
this
accident
happened
rather
than
17,
and
by
becoming
unconscious,
she
becomes
much
like
the
child...
the
adult
child
in
the
youngberg
case.
she
needs...
competence
presumes
that
you
can
decide
on
your
own.
she
can't.
she
needs
someone
to
speak
for
her.
the
family
values,
the
family
information,
the
family
love
that
since
the
time
of
blackstone
has
caused
people
to
act
in
the
best
interest
of
family
members
is
still
there
for
nancy
cruzan's
family.
mr.
william
h.
colby
if...
absolutely,
and
as--
mr.
william
h.
colby
--no.
my
point
is
that
the
state,
if
it
has
information
or
evidence
that
the
family
is
abusive,
or
acting
inappropriately,
then
we
welcome
the
state
intervention.
in
this
case,
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
of
any
kind
of
abusive
nature
of
the
family
decision.
mr.
william
h.
colby
and
we
submit
that
where
a
person
who
is
permanently
unconscious,
where
her
wishes
are
clear,
where
the
family's
belief
in
her
best
interest
is
clear--
mr.
william
h.
colby
--but
for
the
state
to
intrude
in
a
person's
life,
they
have
to
articulate
the
specific
reason,
and
they
absolutely
have
not
done
that
in
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
colby
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
william
h.
colby
no.
no,
i--
mr.
william
h.
colby
--and
i
tried
to
answer
the
chief
justice's
question
in
that
regard
and
maybe
did
not
do
so
clearly.
there
still
is
a
presumption,
as
there
has
been
from
the
start
of
this
country,
that
the
family
is
going
to
act
in
the
best
interest
of
that
patient.
if
that
decision
is
among
acceptable
medical
alternatives,
it's
in
the
best
interest,
and
i
think
the
state...
and
there's
no
evidence
of
wishes...
the
state
still
has
to
show
some
specific
reason
for
intervening
and
intruding
in
that
person's
life.
if
i
might
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal--
mr.
william
h.
colby
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
colby
it
would
certainly
be
important,
in
that
context,
for
the
finder
of
fact
to
determine
what
the
motives
of
the
family
were
and
what
was
in
the
best
interest
of
that
individual,
and
perhaps
to
weigh
the
welfare
of
the
other
children,
too.
but
the
finder
of
fact
would
need
to
make
certain
why
the
parents
were
making
this
decision,
and
to
confirm
that
it
was
being
made
in
the
best
interest
of
their
child.
mr.
william
h.
colby
i
agree.
mr.
william
h.
colby
if
judge
starr
is
correct,
i
have
read
the
opinion
below
too
broadly
and
all
it
stands
for
is
the
proposition
that
this
state
hospital
cannot
be
forced
to
remove
a
tube
that
they
didn't
insert.
we
would
accept
that
reading
of
the
opinion
gladly,
if
nancy
has
some
place
else
to
go
in
the
state
to
have
this
procedure
done
that
she
doesn't
want.
i
would
just
close
with,
it's
important
to
understand
what
the
practical
effect
of
this
decision
is
going
to
be,
which
is
to
say
to
families
shortly
after
an
accident,
your
daughter's
just
had
an
accident.
we
think
she
could
recover,
but
if
she
doesn't--
