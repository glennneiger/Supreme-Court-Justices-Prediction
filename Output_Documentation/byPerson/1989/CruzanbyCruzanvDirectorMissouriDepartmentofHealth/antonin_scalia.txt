justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
colby,
is
it
clear...
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
it...
it
seems
to
me
that
there
may
be
some
dispute
on
the
point
as
to
whether
she
could
have
been
fed
manually
if
that
had
not
been
done.
apparently
your
opponents
say
that
it
is...
it
would
have
been
more
difficult,
but
that
she
could
have
been
fed
manually
by...
by
massaging
the
food
down
her
throat
or
something
of
that
sort.
is
that
correct
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
prediction
of
fact
or
is
that
a
statement
of
law?
you
say
it's
your
belief
that
they
would
have
accepted
it.
would
the
state
have
to
have
accepted
it?
i
mean
suppose
the
parents
were
christian
scientists,
or
for
some
reason
did
not
want
a
relatively
ordinary
surgical
procedure
to
be
performed,
would
the
state
have
to...
would
the
state
have
to
accept
that
determination,
or
would
the
state
not
be
able
to
appoint
a
guardian
and
have
the
guardian
make
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
presume
it's
irrational?
i
mean,
let's
assume
the
person
is
in
a
state
close
to
as
hopeless
as
this
individual
here,
and
the
person
says,
i
want
to
die.
i
am
of
sound
mind
and
it
is
my
desire
to
die.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
a
state
overrule
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well...
well,
then
change
it
from
a
vegetative
state,
it's
just
a
state
of
enormous
pain,
deformity,
quality
of
life
is...
is...
is
nil,
and
the
person
says,
i
want
to
die.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
asking
justice
o'connor's
question.
must...
must
the
state
allow
that
person...
must
the
state
allow
that
person
to
refuse
food
and
water?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
but
you
said
before
that
we
don't.
that
in
the
case
of
a
jehovah's
witness
who
says,
my
child
would
not
want
medical
treatment,
the
state
will
intervene
and
say,
we
don't
care.
your
child
will.
now,
you
say
that
that's
a
religious
belief
and
therefore
it
can
be
disregarded,
but
isn't...
and
this...
but
isn't
this
a
philosophical
belief?
is
that
any
different?
i
mean,
some
people
think
living
is
better
than
not
living,
not
matter
how
terrible
the
life
may
be.
i
mean,
go
back
and
read
ancient
philosophers
fighting
that
old
battle.
and
other
people
think
no,
if
the
quality
of
life
is
not
good,
let's
end
it.
that's
a
philosophical
debate,
just
as
the
jehovah's
witnesses
have
a
religious
view
of
the
matter.
why
can't
the
state
take
a
position,
we
don't
deal
with
philosophy,
we
deal
with
physics,
and
life
will
be
preserved?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
colby,
i
don't
know
any
other
area
where
we
allow
the
family
to
make
a
physical
decision
for
a
family
member,
a
child...
minor
child.
i
don't
know
any
other
area
where
the
state
will
put
certain
limits
on
those
decisions,
and
when
the
family's
decision
is
what
the
state
considers
an
unreasonable
one,
the
state
will
make
the
decision.
now,
is
that
where
your...
where
your
argument
leads?
that
if
the
state
decides
that
the
family
members,
in
deciding
that
this
person
would
want
to
live,
or
ought
to
live,
if
the
state
decides
that
those
family
members
are
unreasonable,
that
no
one,
as
you
say,
would
want
to
live
in
this...
in
this
permanent
vegetative
state,
can
the
state
then
not
make
the
same
decision
in
the
place
of
the
family
members
who
are
being
unreasonable
about
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
state
can
require
the
hospital...
the
state
can
require
a
hospital
to
cease
providing
this
kind
of
medical
care?
that's
where
your
argument
leads?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
matter
of
being
abusive,
any
more
than
the
jehovah's
witness
parents
are
being
abusive.
the
state
just
determines
that
the
decision
that
has
been
made
is
an
unreasonable
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
beyond
whether
her
wishes
are
clear...
that's
a
different
question.
we're
arguing
under
the
chief
justice's
hypothesis:
the
right
of
the
family
to
decide.
doesn't
the
right
of
the
family
to
decide
lead
inevitably
to
the
right
of
the
state
to
decide?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
and
if
they
were
required
so
under
missouri
law,
though,
that
is
justice
blackmun's
question.
then
i
presume
the
constitutional
question
before
us
would
be
the
question
of
whether
they
can
be
compelled
to
pay
under
missouri
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
question
whether
they
can
be
compelled
to
pay
is
quite
separate,
i
assume,
from
the
question
of
whether
they
have
the
right
to
demand
that
the...
that
the
life
of
the
individual
not
be
continued.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr....
mr.
presson,
maybe...
maybe
you're...
you're
being
confused
by
assuming
that
this
is
cost-free
to
the
state.
aren't
there
two
situations?
i
suppose
where
somebody
else
is
paying
for
it,
and
volunteers
to
pay
as
much
as
it
will
cost
to
provide
the
treatment,
then
the
only
interest
the
state
has
in...
in
mind
is
the
welfare
of
the
individual?
but
i
suppose
if
the
state
is
paying
for
it,
it
is
reasonable
for
the
state
to
say,
how
heroic
are
these
measures?
how
much
is
it
going
to
cost
the
state,
versus
what
the
state
can
use
those
funds
for
otherwise?
in
that
situation,
where
the
state
is
paying
for
it,
i
assume
that
the
state
can
say,
well,
there
is
a
certain
entitlement
to
basic
medical
care,
but
we're
not
going
to
pay
for
heroic
measures.
isn't...
isn't
that
one
factor
the
state
can
take
into
account?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
presson,
i
gather
from
your
answer
that
you
think
that
missouri
could
not
enact
a
law
that
said
in
the
event
an
individual
is
unconscious,
normal
medical
procedures
to
keep
that
individual
alive
will
be
applied
unless
the
individual
has
left
word
in
writing
that
he
does
not
want
his
life
to
be
maintained
or
that
he
wants
that
judgment
to
be
made
by
someone
else.
missouri
couldn't
pass
a
law
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
excludes
all
sorts
of
evidence
as
to
what
his
genuine
intent
was,
but
he
did
not
leave
it
in
writing
and,
therefore,
missouri
says
this
is
the
procedure.
we,
you
know...
we
think
it's
an
extraordinary
thing
to
kill
someone,
and
we're
not
going
to
assume
the
individual
writes...
wants
that
unless
he
leaves
word
in
writing
beforehand.
couldn't
missouri
adopt
a
law
like
that?
