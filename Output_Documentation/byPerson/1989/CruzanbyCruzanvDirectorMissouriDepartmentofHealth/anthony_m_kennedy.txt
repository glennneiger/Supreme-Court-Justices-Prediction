suppose
the
evidence
were
to
the
contrary,
and
the
evidence
was
that
for
reasons
of
her
own
moral
philosophy
she
thought
that
life
systems
should
never
be
terminated.
would
the
state
have
to
respect
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
this
case,
then,
if
the
state
has
to
respect
both
wishes,
cannot
we
view
this
case
as
being
one
in
which
the
state
simply
is
saying
that
there
must
be
a
mechanism
where
the
state
can
make
a
clear
determination
of
what
the
wishes
were
one
way
or
the
other,
and
if
that
determination
cannot
be
made,
the
state
simply
opts
for
life.
is
that
the...
is
that
the
way
this
case
comes
to
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
it's
not...
it's
not
all
situations.
it's
where
the
wishes
of
the
person
cannot
be
determined
with
accuracy,
as
the
state...
as
the
state
understands
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
it
seems
to
me
you
assume
the
conclusion.
you're
trying
to
set
up
an
antithesis
in
the
fourteenth
amendment
between
life
and
liberty,
both
of
which
are
protected,
but
you
assume
that
there
is
a
liberty
to
have...
to
die
without
clear
and
convincing
proof,
and
that's
the
very
issue
in
the
case.
so
you
simply
assume
that
issue
when
you
say
liberty.
on
the
other
hand,
life,
you
don't
have...
there's
no
assumption
to
be
made.
we
know
there's
life
here
in
some...
in
some
sense.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
assumes--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
assumes
what
we're
trying
to
find.
you
say
that
liberty
is
inconsistent
with
an
ordered
procedure
to
find
out
what
her
intent
would
be.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
based
on
the
assumption
that
a...
that
the
state
could
override
a
competent
person's
refusal
to
receive
medical
treatment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
that's...
if
that's
true,
then,
in
your
view
there's
no
use
our
even
inquiring
whether
that
right
survives
incompetency
because
there
is
no
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
getting...
getting
back
to
the
competent
person,
i
assume
your
answer
would
be
a
competent
person
could
not
refuse
food
or
water
if
the
state
determined
otherwise,
even
if
that
person
were
in
great
pain?
