mr.
colby,
let
me
follow
through
a
little
bit
on
the
chief's...
the
chief
justice's
inquiry.
in
this
case,
the
expense
is
entirely
that
of
the
state
of
missouri,
is
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
let's
change
that
and
make
it
that
the
expense
was
that
of
the
family
and
that
mr.
cruzan
had
seven
other
children
and
limited
resources,
would
your
argument
be
any
different?
would
the
welfare
of
the
other
children
be
a
factor
entering
into
the
decision?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
we
seem
to
have
overlooked,
here,
too,
what
the
findings
of
the
trial
court
were.
everyone's
speaking
about
what
the
missouri
supreme
court
did
by
a
4-3
decision.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
or
his
the
family?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
patient
or
the
family?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
in
the
best
interest
of...
you...
you
said
it
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
patient,
and
i'm
asking--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--do
you
include
the
family
also?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
answer
is
no,
even
though
the
expense
were
on
the
family,
which
it
is
not
in
this
case,
and
even
though
there
were
other
siblings?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
what
if
it
were,
is
my
question?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
you're
evading
the
answer,
aren't
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
presson,
before
you
sit
down,
i'd
like
to
ask
a...
an
impertinent
and
perhaps
an
improper
question.
have
you
ever
seen
a
patient
in
a
persistent
vegetative
state?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
have
seen
nancy?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
any
others?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
how
come?
