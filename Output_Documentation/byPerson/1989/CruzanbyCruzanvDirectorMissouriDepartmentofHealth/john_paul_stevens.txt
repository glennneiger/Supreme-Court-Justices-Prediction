justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
articulate
reasons
that
are
specific
to
this
patient?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
i...
what
i
still
don't
quite
understand
from
your
argument,
is
it
your
view
that
if
the
actual
wishes
of
the
patient
are
unknowable...
in
many
cases,
i
suppose,
you
just
wouldn't
know.
you
can't
really
get
evidence
that...
people
don't
expect
to
find
themselves
in
this
position...
that
in
that
event,
the
state
can
always
turn
down
and
always
insist
that
the
patient
continue
to
live?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
your
argument
seems
to
focus
entirely
on
trying
to
ascertain
the
intent
of
the
patient.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
presson,
you
started
your
argument
by
saying
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
have
a
judicial
officer
make
a
decision
of
this
kind.
under
missouri
law,
could
the
judge
ever
authorize
the
withdrawal
of
the
life
support
procedures
if
there
was
no
certain
evidence
with
regard
to
the
intent
of
the
patient?
could
there
ever
be
circumstances
that
would
justify
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what...
what
kind
of
circumstances
would
justify
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why...
why...
why
would
that
be
different?
is
that
just
because
it's
a
different
amount
of
dollars
ano
cents
involved?
here
it
costs
about
10,000
a
month,
supposing
it
cost
100,000
a
month
with
all--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
dollars
would
not
be
relevant,
even?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
one
factor
that
would
be
relevant
would
be
discomfort
to
the
patient,
pain?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
else
would
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what's...
why...
why
is
that
significant,
except
in
a
dollars
and
cents
way?
what
difference
does
is
make
if
it's
three
nurses
instead
of
one,
or
two
tubes
instead
of
one?
why
does
that
matter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
there
is
no
pain
involved,
so
what?
why
does
that
make
a
difference?
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
has...
for
your
opponents
to
win,
it
has
to
stem
from
the
constitution.
we
can't
decide
this
on
a
common
law
basis.
we
don't
have
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
the
procedure
has
to
have
some
kind
of
standard
by
which
things
are
done.
you
had
a
procedure
here,
and
a
trial
judge
concluded
that
the
matter
could
go
differently.
you
have
a
procedure
in
place,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
question
for
me
is
what
is
the
standard?
and
is
there
any
possibility
of
withdrawing
the
support
in
the
event
that
the
patient's
desires
are
not
knowable?
because
i
would
think
that
would
be
the
typical
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
depend
on
proof
of
pain?
justice
john
paul
stevens
pain
or
a
lot...
well,
a
more
elaborate
procedure
than
we
have
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
effective
at
doing
what?
this
is
100
percent
effective
at
sustaining
life,
and
that's
all
it
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
you
have
50
percent
effectiveness
in
that
sense?
i
don't
understand
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
two
factors
are,
one,
how
invasive
is
it?
which
is,
to
me,
how
expensive
is
it,
because
the
patient
doesn't
really
know
whether
there
are
one,
two,
three
or
a
hundred
tubes
placed
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
simply
don't...
shoot,
i
simply
don't
understand
that
argument.
if
one
procedure
will
sustain
life
for
20
years
and
another
will
sustain
life
for
10
years,
which
one
is
the
better,
and
why
is
one
better
than
the
other?
and
they're
equally
invasive.
and
the
patient
in
each
case
is
in
a
persistent
vegetative
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
the
state
draw
a
distinction
between
those
two?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
said
50
percent
would
be
the
different
case,
and
i'm
asking
you
why?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
suggesting
it
might
be
in
the
best
interest
to
keep
her
alive
for
20
years,
but
it
would
not
be
in
the
best
interest
to
keep
her
alive
for
10
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
are...
what
are
you
referring
to
50
percent
versus
100
percent?
what
does
that
mean,
other
than
a
difference
in
the
period
which
the
patient
will
live?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
that
rational,
competent
patient
might
say,
yes,
i
want
to
remain
in
this
state
for
20
years,
but
if
i
can
only
stay
in
this
state
for
10
years,
i
wouldn't
do
it?
that's
what
you're
saying.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what...
what
other
factor
is
there
if
the
patient
has
no
sense
of
feeling
whatsoever
and
no
pain
and
nothing
else?
the
only
difference
is
the
length
that
he
or
she
will
survive,
if
i
understand
the
facts.
maybe
i
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well...
but
then,
what
did
you
mean
by
that?
what
did
you
mean
by
the
degree
of
effectiveness?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
you're
changing
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor.
what
you're
saying
is
the
state
could
exclude
all
evidence
other
than
a
written
instrument
satisfying
the
statute
of
wills
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
justice
scalia
posits,
and
you
answer...
you
give
him
one
answer
and
you
give
justice
o'connor
a
different
answer
because
you
said
to
her
that,
no,
they
could
not
exclude
certain
kinds
of
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
is
your
answer
to
that
hypothetical?
i
was
going
to
ask
you
that
very
question
because
here
the
state
relied
on
the
general
interest
in
life.
would
that
general
interest
be
sufficient
to
require
that
life
be
maintained
even
when
the
patent
had
unequivocally
executed
the
kind
of
instrument
that
justice
scalia
described?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
on
that,
why
do
they
disagree?
what
is
the
reason
for
their
disagreement?
the
same
views
in
the
state's,
the
general
interest
in
life?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
would
clearly
disagree
with
any
decision
to
terminate
life?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
their
mission,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
mr.
solicitor
general,
i
would
be
interested,
could
there
be
a
case
in
which
the
federal
constitution
would
require
relief
for
the
patient,
in
your
view,
or
is
it
absolutely
up
to
the
states,
100
percent?
at
least
you
have...
you
must
have
a
position
on
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let's
give
a
specific
example,
supposing
there
were
evidence
in
this
case
that
the
patient
was
suffering
continuous
pain.
maybe
it's
very
mild,
but
continuous
discomfort,
and
you
had
clear
evidence
of
the
intent
of
the
patient;
everybody
agreed
that
it
would
be
in
the
best
interest.
would
the
constitution
permit
the
state
to
say,
we're
very
sorry
but
our
interest
in
maintaining...
the
general
interest
in
life
is
so
strong
that
we
will
not
permit
this
to
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--how
about
modest
pain?
that's
my...
just
the
slightest,
but
continuous
pain,
a
very
slight
discomfort.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
would
agree,
though,
that
the
federal
constitution
is
implicated
by
the...
by
this
kind
of
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
absent
suffering,
you
just
don't
know,
notwithstanding
clear
intent
and
everything
else,
just
like
the
fact,
clear
evidence
of
intent,
you're
just
not
sure
what
the
answer
is
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just...
i'm...
i
perhaps
am
just
repeating
a
question.
is
the
federal
constitution
implicated...
i'd
like
to
have
this
question
answered...
if
there
is
no
pain
but
there's
unequivocal
evidence
of
the
patient's
intent
to
have
withdrawal
of
the
system
in
this
situation?
