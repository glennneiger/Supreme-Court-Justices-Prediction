justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
bork,
isn't
it
possible
to...
i
don't
know
whether
we
are
quarreling
over
the
right
words,
isn't
it
possible
to
have
it
payable
at
the
home...
at
the
home
office,
but
not
payable
from
the
home
office
funds.
couldn't
you
analyze
it
that
way,
saying
even
though
you
have
made
it
payable
there,
in
order
to
overcome
the
banking
regulations
here
you
have
to
make
it
payable
there
out
of
the
home
office
funds?
wouldn't
that...
that
would
give
you
the
same
result,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
isn't
our
reluctance.
our
reluctance
is
to
say
lucky
thing
for
the
eurodollar
market
that
new
york
and
philippine
law
provide
this
way.
because
had
they
provided
otherwise
all
the
chaos
that
you
have
just
described
would
ensue.
you
want
us
to
say
fortunately,
in
this
particular
case
since
it
is
either
new
york
or
philippine
law
that
governs,
and
since
that
law
effectuates
all
the
good
things
you
say,
everything
works
out
okay.
the
next
case
may
be
louisiana,
and
we
will
worry
about
that
when
we
get
to
it.
that
is
basically
what
you
are
telling
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
i
ask
you
a
question
that
relates
to
what
you
just
referred
us
to
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion?
the
court
of
appeals,
as
you
quoted
it,
said
in
the
present
case
the
district
court
found
that
the
parties
had
agreed
that
repayment
was
to
occur
in
new
york.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
can't
one
agree
that
repayment
is
to
be
made
in
new
york
without
agreeing
that
that
repayment
is
to
be
made
out
of
the
funds
of
the
new
york
bank?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
factual
finding
made
by
the
district
court
is
that
repayment
was
to
be
made
in
new
york.
even
if
we
accept
that
and
do
not
at
all
overturn
it,
it
does
not
establish
the
point
that
repayment
is
to
be
made
out
of
new
york
funds,
which
is
what
is
asserted
to
be
contrary
to
the
federal
banking
regime
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
so
you
agree
that
no
factual
finding
precludes
us
in
this
case.
the
district
court
did
not
find
that
there
was
agreed
to
be
repayment
out
of
new
york
funds.
it
just
agreed
that
repayment
would
be
in
new
york.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that...
all
of
that
assumes
that
sokoloff
and
new
york
law
is
what
governs.
and
if
we
were
to
assume
that
it
is
instead
federal
law
that
governs,
there
would
be
no
factual
finding
at
least
that
would
prevent
us
from
reaching
the
conclusion
that
this
didn't
have
to
be
paid
in
new
york,
out
of
new
york
funds.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
at
the
time
these
regs
were
adopted,
and
these
provisions
that
mr.
bork
was
reading
to
us,
there
was
no
difference
between
federal
law
and
state
law.
i
mean,
there
was
assumed
to
be
a
common
law.
i
mean,
we
are
talking
today
as
though
at
the
time
these
things...
this
thing
was
set
up
and
these
regs
were
issued
people
were
thinking
well,
it
is
the
common
law,
but
is
it
new
york
common
law
or
is
it
federal
common
law.
in
fact,
this
was
before
erie,
and
we
didn't
think
there
was
a
difference,
did
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
cited
as
to
the
board
opinion
that's
at
135
and
136
of
the
appendix,
but
i...
if
you
would
look
on
page
136,
what
that
opinion
says
is
that,
under
these
provisions,
deposits
payable
only
at
a
particular
office
outside
the
united
states
are
not
subject
to
reserve
requirements.
then
it
goes
on,
however,
this
is
true
even
if
the
depository
institution,
by
which
i
gather
it
means
the
foreign
branch,
even
if
the
depository
institution
may
be
contractually
obligated
to
obtain
funds
in
order
to
pay
the
deposit
from
another
office
of
the
depository
institution
located
outside
the
united
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
significantly
seems
to
indicate
that
if
it
were
required
to
get
funds
to
pay
the
department
from
another
office
in
the
united
states
we
would
have
a
different
problem.
and
that
is
what
you
are
arguing
was
the
situation
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
one
must
assume
that
if
they
don't
have
to
reserve
against
them
they
don't
have
to
pay
them,
unless
we
have
a
very
crazy
system
in
this
country.
i
mean,
surely
you
would
expect
the
reserve
requirements
to
bear
some
relationship
to
the
obligations
of
the
institution.
