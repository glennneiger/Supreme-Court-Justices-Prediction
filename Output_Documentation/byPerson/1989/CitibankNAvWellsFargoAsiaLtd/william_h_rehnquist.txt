chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-1260,
citibank
v.
wells
fargo
asia
limited.
mr.
bork.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
found...
the
second
circuit
found
there
was
a
contract
to
that
effect,
a
contractual
agreement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
don't
usually
review
those
very
factual
determinations,
was
there
or
was
there
not
a
contract
to
a
particular
effect.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
contend
that
whatever
the
federal
law
is,
the
parties
could
not
agree
otherwise
by
contract
in
a
situation
like
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
are
just
arguing
about
a
very
fact
specific
determination
about
the
second
circuit,
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
agree
that
whatever
view
of
federal
law
one
takes,
the
parties
could
change
the
result
by
agreement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
they
are
allowed
to
make
contracts,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
people
25
years
old
in
this
job
are
not
allowed
to
make
contracts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
that
say
nobody
ever
gets
out
of
line?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
p.m.,
mr.
bork.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
resume
argument
now
in
citibank
v.
wells
fargo.
mr.
bork.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
you
call
that
in
the
world
of
administrative
law,
mr.
bork,
an
interpretive
regulation
or
interpretation
of
a
regulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do...
first
of
all,
how
do
you
know
this,
mr.
merrill,
and
second,
how
do
we
know
it?
was
there
expert
testimony
to
this
effect
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so,
what
you
are
telling
us
now
about
what
everybody
knows
is
based
on
the
testimony
of
expert
witnesses
before
the
trial
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you...
you're
telling
us
that
certain
transactions
have
always
been
assumed
to
be
just
like
this
or
just
like
that.
if
that
isn't
a
question
of
fact,
i
don't
know
what
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
are...
is
what
you
are
telling
us,
were
telling
us
a
moment
ago
that
everybody
knows,
is
that
based
on
findings
of
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
your...
your
opening
remarks,
mr.
merrill,
were
to
the
effect
that
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
people
have
been
taking
for
granted
for
a
long
time,
and
this
is
how
the
cow
ate
the
cabbage,
so
to
speak.
and
i
am
asking
you
what
is
the
source
of
our
knowledge
that
that
is
how
the
cow
ate
the
cabbage?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
those
cases
aren't
binding
on
us.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
what
you're
saying
that
the
regulations
follow
not
a
sort
of
federal
common
law,
but
the
common
law
rule
that
has
been
in
existence
for
a
long
time,
that
is
shown
by
its
state
court
decisions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
federal
regulations
really
just
adopted
what
they
saw
as
being
the
law
already
in
force
in
the
majority
of
jurisdictions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
merrill.
mr.
snider.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
snider,
the
court
granted
certiorari
on
two
questions,
and
the
first,
of
course...
you
know
them
as
well
as
i
do.
the
first
assumes
that
the,
there
was
a
prevention
by
the
philippine
decree.
now,
you
are
entitled
to
argue
for
affirmance
on
an
alternate
ground
under
our
rules,
but
the
court
is
not
ordinarily
interested
in
getting
into
very
fact-specific
questions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
xxx
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
snider.
the
case
is
submitted.
