justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
if
they
can...
if
citibank
could
have
agreed
to
this
liability
by
an
express
contract,
you
would
know...
you
could
protect
yourself
in
every,
every
transaction
after
this
by
making
sure
that
you
didn't
have
such
a
contract.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
are
a
lot
of
transactions
out
there
already
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
is
your,
is
your
suggestion
that...
the
fact
that...
the
holding
that
there
was
a
contract
to
pay
in
new
york
or
to
expose
citibank's
assets
everywhere,
that
is
just
out
of
the
case
because
nobody
defends
the
holding
below?
justice
byron
r.
white
nothing
left...
nothing
left
of
the
case
to
be
decided
below.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
we...
if
we...
to
agree
with
you
we
first
have
to
say
that
there
was
no
contract,
don't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
and
secondly,
and
if
there
isn't
any
contract,
there
can't
be
any
liability
here,
because
of
the
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
new
york
or
philippine
law
has
anything
to
do
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
assume
there
is
no
contract,
and
then
you
say
well,
is
there
some
other
basis
for
liability,
and
you
say
there
can't
be
because
of
the
federal
law,
even
if
new
york
might
say...
the
new
york
law
might
be
that
the
home
office
is
liable.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
if
it
were?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
agencies
may
have
operated
on
this
assumption
for
a
long
time
that
the
home
office
is
not
liable,
but
there
is
no...
is
there
some
specific
provision
in
a
statute
to
that
effect?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
call
it
a
common
law
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
call
it...
call
it
a
common
law
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
are
evidence
of
what
the
common
law
rule
is,
you
think.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
there
is
a
federal
common
law
rule,
it
preempts
the
state
law,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
the
federal
reserve
board
would
have
the
authority
to
put
out
a
regulation
to
this
effect,
make
it
the
force
of
law
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't
the
ground
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
may
be,
but
suppose
the...
suppose
the
philippine
branch
wanted
to
make
the
repayment?
maab
47
interferes
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
pretty--
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
right
across
the
board
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
the
part,
the
district
court
didn't
think
that
there...
that
the...
whatever
agreement
he
found,
namely
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
repayable
in
new
york,
but
that
it
was
collectable
elsewhere.
and
certainly
the
district
court
did
not
rely
on
the
agreement
to
make
citibank
liable.
he
had
to
go
to
the
new
york
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
did
not
rely
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
contract.
whatever
kind
of
a
contract
he
found,
it
wasn't
the
basis
for
liability
in
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
put
it
in
the
context
that
the
district
court
put
it.
he
said
that,
he
said
now
i
am
going
to
have
to
look
elsewhere
for
liability,
besides
their
agreement,
i
have
to
look
at
new
york
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
not
the
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
cited
on.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
because
it
was
going
to,
just
because
the
funds
were
going
to
be
transferred
from
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
that
all
this
talk
about
what
the
regulatory
agencies
have
been
believing
all
these
years,
you
think
they
for
years
have
known
exactly
what
you
are
just
saying
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
there
should
have
been
reserves
all
the
time.
