john
paul

may
i
just
interrupt
for
a
second?
how
do
we
determine
whether
the...
whether
a
deposit
is
payable
solely
at
a
foreign
branch?
for
example--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
it
is
not
insolvent
it
would
have
been
payable
somewhere
else,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
can
you
say
it
is
payable
solely
at
the
branch
office?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the...
but
your
sentence
you
read
to
us
says
a
customer
who
makes
a
deposit
that
is
payable
solely
at
a
foreign
branch
assumes
a
certain
risk.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
if
the
branch
manager
does
run
off
with
the
funds,
it
is
payable
someplace
else.
so
how
can
you
say
it
is
payable
solely
at
a
foreign
branch?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
one
of
the
tough
issues
in
the
case
is
whether
or
not
this
deposit
was
payable
solely
at
a
foreign
branch.
that
is
one
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
one
question
before
you
sit
down?
in
your
view,
if
the
deposit
arrangement
provided
that
the
deposit
would
be
repayable
by
the
home
office
in
the
event
of
insolvency
or
act
of
god
in
manila,
would
that...
but
not
with
regard
to
foreign
risk,
would
that
deposit
be
payable
solely
at
a
foreign
branch
within
the
meaning
of
the
interpretive
regulation
that
judge
bork
called
our
attention
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
answer
my
question
yes
or
no,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it
is
only
conditioned
on
insolvency
or
act
of
god.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
that
quite
correct?
they
didn't
really
defend
on
grounds
of
impossibility.
they
defended
on
the
ground
that
manila
had
imposed
restrictions
on
the
withdrawal--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
that
that
was
in
the
nature
of
a
contractual
defense,
that
under
the
terms
of
the
regulation
if
such
restrictions
are
imposed
they
don't
have
to
pay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
agree,
do
you
not,
that
maab
47
was
a
restriction
on
withdrawals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
would
be
true
with
any
freeze
order,
wouldn't
it?
and
funds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
i
suppose
that
with
any
freeze
order,
if
say
france
freezes
money,
i'm
sure
that
france
would
be
quite
happy
to
say
well,
you
can
substitute
one
deposit
for
another
so
long
as
you
keep
the
amount
in
deposit
as
of
the
time
of
our
freeze
order.
