mr.
darryl
snider
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset
i
will
provide
an
overview
of
the
four
central
points
that
i
would
like
to
leave
with
you
today.
first,
the
philippine
decree
in
question,
maab
47,
did
not
in
any
way
prohibit
repayment
of
these
deposits,
a
finding
of
the
district
court
which
was
affirmed
broadly
by
the
second
circuit
in
its
opinion.
second,
citibank's
unconditional
promise
to
repay
is
not
limited
to
any
particular
assets.
third,
no
federal
law
or
regulation
limits
citibank's
obligation
to
repay
to
any
particular
assets.
and
fourth,
and
finally,
policy
considerations
do
not
call
for
this
court
now
to
create
new
federal
law
in
this
area.
let
me
then
turn
to
my
first
point.
it
is
one
that
really
hasn't
been
discussed.
it
has
been
glossed
over
today;
it
was
glossed
over
in
the
briefs.
and
i
think
it
is
so
fundamental
to
an
understanding
of
this
case
and
to
the
contractual
relationship
of
the
parties
and
what
the
courts
below
did
that
we
must
deal
with
it
at
the
outset.
the
brief
of
the
petitioner
and
the
argument
today
proceeds
upon
the
false
assumption
that
some
action
taken
by
the
philippine
central
bank
prevented
repayment
of
these
deposits
by
citibank.
and
in
fact
that
is
exactly
contrary
to
what
both
courts
below
held.
so
we
must
begin
by
analyzing
what
is
it
that
the
philippine
government
did,
and
how
did
that
action
relate
to
either
the
assets
of
citibank
on
the
one
hand,
or
the
deposits
of
wells
fargo
on
the
other
hand.
if
we
look
at
the
verbiage
of
maab
47
and
the
way
it
was
construed
and
enforced
by
the
philippine
central
bank
and
the
government,
what
we
find,
contrary
to
petitioner's
argument,
is
that
it
was
only
citibank's
assets
in
its
manila
branch
that
were
affected
by
the
philippine
regulation.
what
the
philippine
central
bank
said
was
because
of
certain
economic
instability
in
our
country
we
are
going
to
request
that
you
obtain
prior
approval
from
us
if
you
are
going
to
reduce
the
overall
level
of
your
loan
activities
in
the
philippines.
it
did
not
say,
as
in
a
perez
case
or
in
a
garcia
case
or
some
of
these
other
cases,
we
are
going
to
seize
the
deposit,
we
are
going
to
garnish
the
deposit
of
wells
fargo,
the
debtor,
the
depositor
here.
it
did
not
take
action
that
was
directed
at
all
at
wells
fargo.
wells
fargo
merely
had
two
deposits
for
six
months
on
deposit
with
citibank
at
the
time
that
this
action
occurred.
the
deposits
were
made
in
june
of
1983.
the
regulation
was
adopted
in
october
of
1983.
in
december
these
deposits
matured,
and
citibank
at
that
time
had
no
legal
excuse
for
nonpayment.
after
wells
fargo
demanded
payment
at
manila
and
citibank
refused
to
pay,
they
then
claimed
that
they
had
a
defense
of
impossibility.
so
it
is
important
at
the
outset
to
understand
that
the--
mr.
darryl
snider
--justice
stevens,
if--
mr.
darryl
snider
--in
the
answer
that
they
filed,
one
of
the
affirmative
defenses
they
pled,
although
they
did
not
use
the
specific
word
maab
47
and
the
action
taken
by
the
philippine
government.
mr.
darryl
snider
no,
i
disagree,
justice
stevens.
i
think
that
is
at
the
very
root
of
the
case.
let
me
point
to
two
pieces
of
evidence
that
were
found
by
the
court
below
to
answer
that
very
question.
first
of
all,
in
the
spring
of
1984
citibank
made
a
limited
request
to
the
philippine
central
bank
requesting
that
it
have
permission
to
repay
only
to
the
extent
of
its
non-philippine
assets
that
it
held
in
its
manila
branch.
and
having
postured
the
question
that
way,
which
i
would
submit
was
part
of
their
litigation
strategy,
they
got
back
an
answer
which
said
of
course,
you
can
repay
these
deposits
to
the
extent
of
your
non-philippine
assets
at
the
manila
branch.
but
here
is
the
question
they
didn't
ask.
they
didn't
ask
can
we
have
permission
under
this
regulation
to
repay
with
our
assets
that
are
outside
the
philippines.
because
had
they
asked
that
question,
they
would
have
got
an
answer
that
they
didn't
like.
and
justice
stevens,
we
didn't
just
sit
back
then.
we
asked
ourself
that
question
in
december
of
1984,
and
it's
at
page
95
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
philippine
central
bank
sent
a
telex
to
wells
fargo's
counsel
answering
the
very
question,
we
have
no
objection,
they
said,
to
repayment
of
these
deposits,
as
long
as
you
do
not
in
any
way
reduce
the
philippine
assets
of
citibank
at
its
manila
branch.
mr.
darryl
snider
that's
the
point.
no
action
was
taken
to
freeze
the
deposits.
the
only
thing
that
was
frozen
here,
and
only
frozen
for
a
limited
period
of
time,
were
the
assets
of
citibank.
and
so
the
question
that
is
being
raised
is
there
some
nexus
or
some
link--
mr.
darryl
snider
--justice
kennedy,
let
me
see
if
i
can
distinguish
two
things.
what
the
philippine
government
was
saying
is
with
respect
to
the
loans
that
you
have
made
to
philippine
borrowers,
whether
they
be
farmers
or
merchants,
we
do
not
want
you
to
reduce,
because
we
don't
want
an
outflow
of
foreign
currency.
we
don't
want
you
to
reduce
the
overall
level
of
those
loans
to
philippine
borrowers.
you
can
call
them
in,
you
can
collect
them,
you
can
pay
them
back,
but
you
must
maintain
a
level
of
overall
funding
in
the
philippines.
they
did
not
in
any
way
go
further
and
say,
in
addition,
to
the
extent
that
you
pay
off
wells
fargo,
you
are
going
to
have
to
in
addition
to
that
fund
other
borrowers
that
were
putting
in
u.s.
dollar
deposits.
that
was
not
part
of
the
regulation
at
all.
if
you
just
look
at
what
the
philippine
central
bank
itself
said
it
did,
rather
than
the
way
citibank
characterizes
it,
it's
clear
in
joint
appendix
95,
it
is
clear
with
the
wording
of
the
stand
still
agreement,
which
is
joint
appendix
118,
and
moreover
it
is
clear
that
by
the
time
that
the
philippine
central
bank
gave
partial
permission
to
repay,
based
on
the
request
that
was
made,
which
is
at
joint
appendix
89
to
91,
that
they
had
no
objection
whatsoever
to
citibank
repaying
these
deposits
after--
mr.
darryl
snider
--yes,
justice
white,
and
in
fact--
mr.
darryl
snider
--it
is
one
of
the
two
grounds
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
your
honor...
justice
white.
let
me
see
if
i
can
point
you
to
that.
part
of
the
confusion
that
i
heard
this
morning
was
over
exactly
what
the
second
circuit
decided
and
to
what
extent
that
related
to
decisions
of
the
district
court.
if
you
turn
to
petitioner's
appendix,
this
is
in
the
white--
mr.
darryl
snider
--petition
for
certiorari,
that
appendix,
at
page
7a.
at
the
bottom
paragraph,
the
very
first
sentence
answers
one
of
the
questions
that
you
posed
this
morning
to
mr.
bork.
in
the
present
case,
the
district
court
found
that
the
parties
had
agreed
that
repayment
was
to
occur
in
new
york.
that
finding
plainly
is
not
clearly
erroneous.
that
was
the
first
arm
of
the
second
circuit's
decision,
which
i
would
submit
is
binding
here
and
is
a
fact
finding
not
generally
to
be
reviewed
by
this
court.
but
then
the
court
went
on,
and
on
the
bottom
of
that
paragraph
at
page
7a
said
since
maab
47
has
no
effect
on
a
bank's
obligations
to
perform
acts
outside
of
the
philippines,
we
conclude
that
the
district
court
did
not
err
in
upholding
wfal's
claim.
and
that
is
the
same
finding
that
was
made
by
the
district
court
below,
that
maab
47--
mr.
darryl
snider
--no,
it
did
not.
only...
it
only
interfered
with
it
if
it
used
philippine
assets.
that
is
the
key
to
this
case.
mr.
darryl
snider
but
they
had
more
than
philippine
assets.
and
in
fact
what
judge
knapp
held
in
his
first
ruling
was
that
there
was
nothing
in
maab
47
that
prevented
citibank
from
transferring
assets
from
new
york
or
elsewhere,
anywhere
else
in
the
world
that
it
had
assets,
into
the
manila
branch.
after
all,
that
is
an
internal
bookkeeping
matter
between
the
manila
branch
and
citibank.
mr.
darryl
snider
okay.
let
me
move
then
to
my
second
point,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
darryl
snider
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
darryl
snider
i
think--
mr.
darryl
snider
--yes.
and
that...
i
agree
with
that.
and
that
essentially
takes
us
to
my
second
point.
in
other
words,
you
don't
look
to
the
agreement
of
the
parties
to
where
it
can
be
collected.
you
look
to
local
law.
in
this
case--
mr.
darryl
snider
--i
would
agree
that
no
fact
finding
absolutely
prohibits
your
decision.
what
i
am
saying
is
that,
once
the
court
made
the
fact
finding
that
repayment
was
to
occur
in
new
york
and
it
applied
the
applicable
law
of
sokoloff,
which
had
been
on
the
books
for
60
years
since
judge
cardozo
decided
that
case.
and
once
you
apply
that
law
what
you
will
see
is
essentially
this
distinction
in
the
books.
and
that
is
that
when
a
foreign
government
seizes
the
assets
of
a
bank,
the
depositor
can
still
collect
the
deposit
at
the
home
office
of
the
bank.
in
a
perez-type
case,
if
the
foreign
government
goes
further
and
takes
a
second
step
and
seizes
the
deposit,
or
garnishes
the
deposit,
or
freezes
the
deposit
in
some
respect,
then
that
is
a
risk,
indeed,
that
was
taken
by
the
depositor.
and
unless
you
have
a
garcia
type
guarantee
in
that
situation
then
you
are
out
of
luck.
mr.
darryl
snider
i
think
that
the...
the
fact
finding
that
is
binding
is
that
repayment
was
to
occur
in
new
york.
there
is
no
fact
finding
on
where
those
assets
have
to
come
from.
but
both
courts
held...
the
district
court
held
that
it
could
be
repaid
in
manila
without
violating
the
decree.
the
new
york
court
merely
narrowed
that
holding,
the
second
circuit
narrowed
that
holding
by
saying
indeed,
since
we
find
it
to
be
repayable
in
new
york,
we
don't
even
have
to
reach
that
question.
citibank
has
enough
assets
in
new
york;
we
find
it
to
be
payable
there.
mr.
darryl
snider
well,
this
was
not
a
demand
deposit
in
the
first
place,
but
we
could
have
made
a
demand
there
because,
indeed,
in
the
trial
of
this
case,
we
submitted
it
to
the
trial
court
on
the
basis
that
philippine
law
applied
and
that
it
was
repayable
in
manila
upon
the
maturity
of
the
deposits
in
six
months.
and
the
court
held
that
indeed
at
the
end
of
six
months
appropriate
steps
had
been
taken.
wells
fargo
had
done
what
was
necessary,
and
payment
was
to
be
made.
its
payment
was
unexcused.
there
is
no
condition
on
the
obligation
here
with
respect
to
payment.
let
me
then
address
the
question
of
federal
law
that
mr.
bork
raised
this
morning,
and
i
think
justice
scalia
was
driving
at
in
his
last
question.
one
of
the
questions
that
has
now
been
raised
for
the
first
time
by
petitioner
at
this
court
and
was
not
raised
in
the
two
lower
courts
is
whether
or
not
reg.
d
and
the
1970
board
interpretation
can
be
construed
to
displace
local
law
on
this
subject,
which
has
been
a
set
of
dual
regulation
for
the
last
60
or
70
years,
and
has
traditionally
been
the
subject
not
of
federal
law,
but
with
respect
to
state
law.
we
are
not
talking
about
the
question
of
reserves.
that
has
been
a
subject
of
federal
law.
we
are
talking
about
the
traditional
relationship
between
a
bank
and
its
depositors.
mr.
darryl
snider
not
before
erie,
but
that
was
certainly
the
enactment
of
the
federal
reserve
act.
i
think
it's
really
the
1970
board
interpretation
that
mr.
bork
read
to
you
in
part
today
that
they
rely
on.
that
board
interpretation
sets
up
a
way
of
defining
when
reserves
must
be
made
with
respect
to
foreign
deposits.
it
does
not
in
any
way
purport
to
regulate
the
subject
of
when
a
depositor
can
be
repaid
from
a
foreign
branch.
it
is
not
a
rule
about
liability.
i
think
that
the
petitioner
here
has
mixed
up
cause
and
effect.
what
the
regulation
says
is
that
you
look
at
the
contractual
relationship
of
the
parties
to
assist
you
in
determining
whether
or
not
reserves
must
be
assessed.
it
doesn't
say
the
converse
of
that.
it
doesn't
say
you
look
at
whether
reserves
were
paid,
and
then
from
having
looked
at
whether
reserves
were
paid
you
come
back
and
decide
whether
there
is
liability
or
not.
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
that
is
indeed
why
the
u.s.
government
here
in
its
brief
and
in
its
argument
does
not
contend
that
local
law
has
been
displaced
by
reg.
d
or
by
the
1970
board
interpretation
at
all.
and
in
fact
on
this
question
we
sought
to
clarify
the
matter
with
the
federal
reserve
board
of
governors.
and
one
of
the
pieces
of
evidence
that
was
put
in
at
the
trial
court
and
is
before
you
in
joint
appendix
135
is
an
opinion
letter
of
the
board
of
governors
for
the
federal
reserve
board
in
april
of
1987,
after
this
case
was
tried...
after
this
case
was
filed.
and
that
opinion
letter
distinguishes
the
concept
of
liability
on
the
one
hand
and
reserves
on
the
other.
it
says
that
reg.
d
and
the
1970
board
interpretation
regulate
reserves
but
do
not
regulate
the
subject
of
liability
as
between
a
bank
and
its
depositors,
and
goes
on
to
say
in
fact
nothing
in
reg.
d
or
the
board
interpretation
would
prevent
a
bank
from
transferring
assets
from
a
u.s.
office
to
a
foreign
office
to
effect
a
repayment
in
these
circumstances.
and
so,
just
as
justice
stevens
was
saying
earlier
this
morning
in
his
questioning,
just
like
in
the
case
of
insolvency
where
the
home
office
might
well
have
to
pay
because
the
foreign
branch
office
cannot
pay,
the
same
is
true
in
this
circumstance.
now,
that
is
not
to
say
that
wells
fargo
did
not
take
any
risk
whatsoever.
we
are
not
here
to
say
that
we
took
no
risk
and
therefore
somehow
citibank
should
have
paid
reserves.
that
is
not
the
issue.
but
the
question
is
what
is
the
risk
that
wells
fargo
took.
the
risk
it
took
was
a
perez-type
risk
that
the
foreign
government
might
actually
take
an
action
that
was
directed
at
it
as
an
individual.
after
all,
that
is
what
mr.
castro
did
in
the
perez
and
garcia
cases.
he
was
taking
a
certain
action
to
seize
the
deposits
of
certain
political
individuals
that
he
wished
to
point
out
and
to
deprive
of
their
assets.
that
is
a
very
minimal
risk
when
you
are
talking
about
a
banking
institution
in
the
inter-bank
market.
we
did
not
take
the
risk.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
expert
of
citibank
at
the
trial
admitted
that
in
this
situation
wells
fargo
did
not
take
the
risk
that
some
other
regulation
might
be
adopted
that
interfered
in
some
way
with
citibank's
assets.
it
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
very
question
that
is
before
the
court
today.
and
mr.
ian
giddy,
who
is
citibank's
own
expert,
on
cross-examination
gave
the
following
testimony.
"and
the
expectations
of
bankers,
the
practice,
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
get
to,
is
that
they
would
be
repaid
by
the
home
office,
isn't
it.
"
"answer,
under
the
circumstances
where
the
branch
had
its
assets
restricted
or
seized,
and
that
was
a
poor
loan
decision
by
the
bank
and
it
is
their
risk,
they
are
still
liable
for
the
deposits.
"
one
of
the
important--
mr.
darryl
snider
--i
am
reading,
i'm
sorry,
justice
blackmun,
i
am
reading
from
joint
appendix
378,
379.
our
own
expert,
of
course,
came
to
the
same
conclusion.
mr.
darryl
snider
yes.
mr.
darryl
snider
well,
at
worst
it
would
mean
that
citibank
should
have
reserved
against
these
deposits.
i
don't
think
that
this
regulation--
mr.
darryl
snider
--i
think
they
bear
a
relationship,
but
i
think
once
again
that
is
reversing
cause
and
effect
here.
nothing
in
this
regulation
or
the
interpretation
of
it
in
any
way
attempts
to
assess
liability
or
to
displace
local
law
with
respect
to
the
relationship
between
a
bank
and
its
depositors.
mr.
darryl
snider
yes,
justice
white,
i...
it
was
heard
this
morning
in
this
courtroom
that
no
one
supported
that
view,
but
i
wanted
to
wait
my
turn
to
tell
you
that
i
did.
we
support
the
second
circuit's
opinion,
and
we
find
that
it
has
at
least
two
important
elements.
one,
just
a
simple
finding
that
the
deposit
was
repayable
in
new
york
by
citibank
was
sufficient
for
the
second
circuit,
having
found
such
an
agreement,
to
uphold
the
lower
court's
decision.
because
if
it
is
payable
in
new
york
and
the
parties
agree
that
it
is
payable
in
new
york,
then
citibank
certainly
has
assets
there.
mr.
darryl
snider
he
did
have
to
go
to--
mr.
darryl
snider
--that
is
right.
he
did
have
to
go
to--
mr.
darryl
snider
--it
takes
more
than
just
a
yes
or
no
answer,
if
you
would
permit
me,
justice
white.
if
you
look
at
page
16a
of
petitioner's
appendix,
we
have
the
district
court's
second
opinion.
and
indeed
he
did
find
an
agreement
that
the
confirmations
established
an
agreement
that
repayment
was
to
occur
in
new
york.
mr.
darryl
snider
now,
he
goes
on,
on
page
17a,
as
you
said,
to
decide
that
there
was
not
a
specific
agreement
as
to
where
things
were
to
be
collected,
where
the
money
was
to
be
collected.
in
other
words,
he
found
no
limitation
as
to
where
it
was
to
be
collected.
but
we
need
to
put
this
in
context.
this
case
was
tried
after
summary--
mr.
darryl
snider
--he
did.
mr.
darryl
snider
he
did.
but
we
need
to
go
back--
mr.
darryl
snider
--the
court
of
appeals
narrowed
that
decision
and,
from
finding
that
it
was
repayable
in
new
york,
decided
that
citibank
had
to
pay
their...
had
assets.
mr.
darryl
snider
well,
it
was
more
than
that.
in
fact,
the
testimony
that
had
been
given
to
the
district
court
on
the
subject
went
beyond
just
the
so-called
standard
routing
instructions.
and
in
fact
at
pages
10
and
11
of
our
brief,
and
i
won't
go
through
all
the
testimony
with
you
today,
but
it
is
there.
the
testimony
was
given
by
mr.
boughey,
the
testimony
was
given
by
mr.
cole,
who
were
called
by
wells
fargo,
and
indeed
the
testimony
was
given
by
mr.
howard,
the
chief
financial
officer
of
citibank,
that
in
addition
to
these
routing
instructions
the
parties
expected
and
agreed
that
repayment
would
occur
in
new
york.
and
after
all,
we
have
got
to
realize
that
in
the
eurodollar
market
we
are
dealing
with
dollars
in
which
these
transactions
not
only
clear
in
new
york,
but
there
is
a
specific
agreement
embodied
in
the
very
nature
of
the
eurodollar
transaction
that
the
parties
are
agreeing
that
the
bank,
the
institution,
stands
behind
these
deposits.
one
of
the
important
concepts--
mr.
darryl
snider
--oh,
indeed,
and
in
fact--
mr.
darryl
snider
--no,
not
that
there
should
have
been
reserves.
indeed,
if
you
go
back
to
the
1918
interpretation
you
will
see
that
the
federal
reserve
itself
acknowledges
that
the
institution
itself
ultimately
remains
liable
for
the
deposits.
but
i
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
context--
mr.
darryl
snider
--perhaps
that
was
too
broad
a
statement.
let
me
come
back.
what
we
have
had
since
1983,
since
citibank
defaulted
in
this
case,
is
a
situation
in
the
world
market,
and
much
of
this
is
discussed
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
bank
of
montreal,
a
situation
in
which
banks
now
will
only
place
money
in
secure
money
centers.
there
are
no
longer
inter-bank
deposits
in
manila,
no
longer
inter
bank
deposits
in
panama.
they
are
either
in
london
or
in
frankfurt
or
the
cayman
islands,
in
a
secure
location.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
because
no
one
in
1983
assumed
that
the
depositors
were
taking
this
kind
of
sovereign
risk,
and
that
is
what
the
trial
was
all
about,
after
all.
we
moved
for
summary
judgment.
the...
citibank
came
in
and
said
we
will
prove
a
custom
and
practice
that
indeed
depositors
in
the
marketplace
will
not
be
repaid
whenever
there
is
any
interference
whatsoever
with
our
assets
or
any
repayment.
and
the
trial
was
had.
they
had
their
day
in
court.
the
witnesses
were
called.
and
indeed
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
such
custom
and
practice.
and
one
of
the
key
points
that
the
district
court
relied
upon
is
at
the
very
time
that
these
deposits
were
made,
in
june
of
1983,
citibank
was
offering
a
10
percent
interest
rate
in
frankfurt,
london,
singapore
and
manila,
and
yet
everyone
knew
that
in
terms
of
political
economic
instability,
the
philippines
were
a
riskier
location.
and
yet
the
interest
rates
were
identical.
mr.
darryl
snider
no,
i
don't
think
that
it
assumes
that
they
are
safer.
i
think
that
the
only
purpose
now
for
the
federal
reserve
regulation
of
reserves
is
no
longer
a
concept
that
we
have
to
have
a
certain
amount
of
money
set
aside
in
case
there
is
some
kind
of
a
run
on
the
bank.
i
think
that
was
one
of
the
original
purposes.
as
the
1980
amendments
to
the
act
provide,
the
only
remaining
purpose
for
the
federal
reserve
regulation
of
reserves
is
monetary
policy,
the
implementation
of
monetary
policy.
mr.
darryl
snider
no,
i
don't,
justice
white.
let
me
try
one
more
time.
the
federal
reserve
understanding
is
that
because
they
did
not
want...
they
wanted
u.s.
banks
on
the
one
hand
to
be
able
to
compete
in
the
eurodollar
market,
okay.
to
do
that
they
had
to
make
offshore
deposits
free
from
reserves
and
free
from
fdic
assessments,
so
that
u.s.
banks
could
be
competitive
and
could
offer
the
same
kind
of
interest
rates
that
banks
abroad
are
offering.
okay?
having
set
up
that
exemption
from
reserves,
they
then
were
concerned
about
a
situation
like
garcia,
and
this
whole
interpretation
came
up
because
of
a
garcia
situation.
that's
where
the
depositor
not
only
made
the
deposit
at
the
offshore
branch,
it
simultaneously
exacted
a
promise
out
of
the
bank
saying
but
if
anything
happens
to
interfere
with
repayment,
i've
got
a
guarantee
that
i
will
be
repaid
in
new
york.
and
the
federal
government
and
the
board
interpretation
is
saying
no,
you
can't
do
that.
mr.
darryl
snider
i
believe
they
would
say
that,
except
for
their
objection
here
through
the
solicitor
general
to
the
reliance
upon
routing
instructions.
but
i
believe
that
they
would
agree
that,
in
the
absence
of
a
garcia
guarantee,
that
the
normal
rule
of
sokoloff
applies,
that
when
only
the
assets
of
the
bank
are
interfered
with
or
regulated
by
the
foreign
government
and
there
is
no
action
to
take
on
the
deposits.
in
fact,
the
very
language
of
the
c.f.r.
regulation
that
they
rely
on,
204.128,
is
when
there
is
imposition
of
a
restriction
on
a
withdrawal.
and
i
ask
you,
has
there
been
an
imposition
of
a
restriction
on
wells
fargo's
deposit
with
respect
to
withdrawal?
both
courts
below
have
answered
that
question
no.
the
only
action
taken
in
the
philippines
was
to
restrict
citibank's
assets
to
require
them
to
continue
to
invest
in
the
philippines
until
the
philippines
could
restructure
its
debt.
it
had
no
objection,
as
it
said
in
the
telex,
to
repayment
of
these
deposits
with
dollars
in
new
york
in
the
united
states.
let
me
just
finish,
since
i
have
a
limited
amount
of
time
left,
with
some
policy
considerations
that
i
think
are
important
here.
this
market
is
one
in
which
only
two
of
the
top
50
banks
in
the
world
are
from
this
country.
this
market
is
one
in
which,
while
there
are
billions
of
dollars
of
transactions
taking
place
every
day,
they
take
place
under
terms
and
understandings
that
have
been
agreed
to
and
agreed
upon
by
bankers
around
the
world,
and
the
subject
matter
that
we
are
talking
about
is
one
that
is
not
appropriate,
in
my
view,
to
regulation
by
a
court
through
enforcement
or
interpretation
of
a
regulation
like
reg.
d.
this
is
a
matter
that
should
be
discussed...
if
we
are
going
to
change
the
rules,
because
all
wells
fargo
contends
is
that
the
status
quo
should
be
maintained,
but
if
citibank
wants
to
change
the
rules,
it
is
a
more
appropriate
subject
either
for
private
negotiation--
mr.
darryl
snider
--we
went
to
court,
justice
white,
because
under
the
rules
at
that
time
the
depositor
could
be
repaid,
and
in
fact
the
court
found
that
when
citibank
announced
this
new
rule,
the
depositors
around
the
world
reacted
with
outrage
and
despair.
no
one
else
in
the
world
had
this
understanding
except
citibank.
and
the
court
below
said
you
know,
it
would
have
been
a
dead
cinch,
you
had
this
view,
you
knew
that
nobody
else
was
taking
the
view
that
they
were
taking
the
sovereign
risk.
it
would
have
been
so
easy
for
you
either
by
way
of
contract,
by
putting
a
legend
on
your
confirmation
slips,
by
sending
out
a
letter
or
some
other
means
communicating
to
all
these
depositors
that
you
had
this
unique
view
that
everyone
else
was
taking
the
risk.
and
in
fact
i
don't
even
believe
citibank
had
the
view
until
after
they
defaulted.
because
what
did
they
do
right
after
they
defaulted?
they
sent
a
letter
to
us
and
to
the
other
depositors
and
said
now
that
you
are
assuming
the
sovereign
risk
we
will
pay
you
1-1/8
percent
interest
over
libor,
which
is
the
london
inter-bank
offer
rate.
they
didn't
do
that
before,
they
just
paid
us
the
10
percent.
and
both
experts
said
we
didn't
pay
any
sovereign
risk
premium.
and
as
soon
as
this
situation
happened
the,
citibank
went
out
and
it
offered
a
point
and
an
eighth
over
libor.
those
offers
by
citibank
are
found
in
the
joint
appendix
115
with
respect
to
wells
fargo,
116
for
marine
midland,
and
399
for
the
bank
of
montreal.
so,
citibank,
having
come
to
its
own
unique
view
of
the
world,
then
attempted
essentially
to
shift
this
loss
to
all
of
its
depositors.
what
it
is
asking
this
court
to
do
is
to
give
it
something
that
it
couldn't
accomplish
in
private
arms'
length
negotiation,
that
it
couldn't
accomplish
through
the
application
of
local
law.
thank
you,
your
honor.
