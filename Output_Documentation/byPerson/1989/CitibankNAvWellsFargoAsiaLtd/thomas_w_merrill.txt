mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
lower
courts
in
this
case
adopted
two
general
theories
in
support
of
the
conclusion
that
a
routine
eurodollar
placed
with
a
foreign
branch
of
a
united
states
bank
is
a
general
obligation
to
the
bank
as
a
whole.
the
district
court
found
that
there
had
been
no
agreement
between
the
parties
as
to
where
the
deposit
would
be
repaid,
but
concluded
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
deposit
obligation
was
an
obligation
of
the
bank
as
a
whole.
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
that
statement
of
the
rule
of
law,
but
found
that
in
fact
the
routing
instructions
that
the
parties
had
agreed
to
for
settlement
of
the
deposit
account
in
new
york
constituted
an
agreement
to
repay
in
the
united
states.
let
me
briefly
address
why
both
of
those
are
matter
of
deep
concern
to
the
federal
banking
agencies
and
why
we
think
in
particular
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
cannot
stand
as
a
matter
of
law.
it
has
long
been
understood
by
the
banking
community
and
by
the
federal
banking
agencies
that
the
relationship
between
a
deposit
agreement
and
instructions
for
settlement
of
a
deposit
through
the
new
york
clearinghouse
bears
roughly
the
same
relationship
as
any
type
of
contractual
obligation
pays
to
provisions
for
the
clearance
of
a
check
that
might
be
written
in
satisfaction
of
that
contractual
obligation.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes,
there
was
testimony
in
the
district
court
about
the
significance
of
the
routing
instructions.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
it
was
all
to
the
effect
that
the
routing
instructions
were
not
understood
to
be
part
of
the
obligation
of
the
parties.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
it
is
not
a
question
of
fact,
your
honor.
the
district
court
found--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
it
is
not
a
question
of
fact
because
the
district
court
found
the
facts
in
this
case.
the
district
court
specifically
found
two
things.
it
found...
it
made
a
distinction
between
what
it
called
the
provisions
for
clearing...
for
repayment
of...
it
defined
repayment
as
the
provisions
for
routing
money
between
the
banks,
and
it
distinguished
that
from
collectability,
which
it
defined
as
where
the
parties
could
look
to
satisfy
the
obligation.
it
found
that
there
had
been
no
agreement
reached
on
collectability,
which
is
what
we
understand
to
mean
repayment.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
as
a
matter
of
law
that
this
is
an
obligation
in
new
york.
it
did
not
question
any
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
two
things
basically.
one
would
be,
of
course,
prior
case
law
about
the
relationship
between
banking
deposits
and
routing
instructions,
which
is
entirely...
is
completely
consistent
that
the
routing
instructions
have
no
effect
on
the
modification
of
the
obligation.
that
is
the
holding
of
the
second
circuit
in
the
braka
case.
it's
the
holding
of
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
callejo
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no,
those
are
cases
construing
as
a
matter
of
law
that
the
type...
those
types
of
routing
obligations
don't
constitute
a
contract.
the
district
court
found
that
the
routing
instructions
were
not
a
contract
that
affected
the
obligation
to
repay.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
because
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
the
findings
that--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--but
construed
the
routing
agreements
to
be
a
legal
obligation
to
repay
in
the
united
states.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
there
was
an
agreement
about
routing
instructions,
but
the
court
of
appeals
changed
the
interpretation
of
that
as
a
matter
of
law
to
be
an
agreement
to
repay
in
new
york.
there
are
approximately
$1.5
trillion
worth
of
eurodollar
deposits
in
existence
in
the
world
today;
90
percent
of
those
are
cleared
through
these
banks
in
new
york.
the
federal
reserve
and
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
have
for
years
followed
a
basic
two-step
process
in
deciding
the
question
of
where
an
obligation
is
repaid...
is
repayable.
whether
it
is
payable
only
outside
the
united
states
or
payable
in
the
united
states.
first
they
look
to
the
agreement
of
the
parties,
the
deposit
agreement.
and
if
the
deposit
agreement
specifically
provides
for
a
place
of
payment,
that
is
where
it
is
determined
to
be
payable.
secondly,
if
there
is
no
agreement,
it
is
presumed
to
be
payable
at
the
branch
where
it
has
been
placed.
now,
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
correct
that
routine
routing
instructions,
which
are
no
different
in
any
material
respect
from
the
routing
instructions
that
accompany
all
of
these
eurodollar
transactions,
constitute
an
agreement
to
make
the
obligation...
the
underlying
obligation
payable
in
the
united
states,
then
the
entire
understanding
on
which
the
banking
agencies
have
been
operating
has
been
totally
revolutionized.
the
eurodollar
market
would
be
called
into
question,
and
it
would
have
significant
implications
for
the
security
and
stability
of
the
united
states
banking
system.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
don't
think
there
is
any
difference
in
our
position
with
respect
to
the
second
circuit's
rationale.
i
think
we
both
agree
that
as
a
matter
of
law
that
is
simply
erroneous.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
that
as
a
matter
of
new
york
and
philippine
law
there
is
no
basis
whatsoever
for
concluding
that
these
are
general
obligations
of
the
bank.
i
can
understand
how
the
court
might
be
reluctant
to
wade
into
deciding
questions
of
philippine
law,
and
our
invitation
brief
we
simply
suggested
that
the
matter
be
remanded
to
the
second
circuit.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
we
think
that
if
in
fact
new
york
and
philippine
law
had
a
contrary
understanding,
that
that
would
have
very
serious
implications
for
the
way
in
which
the
federal
banking
system
operates,
and
we
would
at
that
point
urge
the
application
of
some
type
of
federal
common
law
rule
to
resolve
this
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
our
reluctance
to
do
so
so
far
has
been
that
we
have
been
quite
convinced
that
in
fact
there
is
nothing
in
either
new
york
or
philippine
law
which
suggests
that
it
is
in
any
way
inconsistent--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--that
would
be
the
most
natural
thing
to
do
about
that,
and
i
can
understand
how
the
court
might
not
wish
to
do
that,
given
that
both
parties
have...
that
the
court
granted
certiorari.
we
recommended
in
our
invitational
brief
granting
certiorari
only
on
the
second
question
about
the
routing
instructions,
but
the
court
has
granted
certiorari
on
both
questions.
parties
have
extensively
briefed
the
question
of
what
the
underlying
rule
of
law
ought
to
be,
and
the
court
may
very
well
wish
to
consider
a
proceeding
to
decide
that
question.
the
federal
government
has
no
policy
objection
to
the
use
of
a
federal
common
law
rule
in
this
context.
we
would
in
fact
be
quite
delighted
with
such
a
rule.
we
simply
have
been
concerned--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--excuse
me?
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
a
federal
common
law
rule?
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
we
don't
construe
our
regulations
as
being
preemptive.
we
think
they
are
interpretive
regulations
which
rest
on
the
understanding
that
the
common
law
rule,
absent
agreement--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--yes.
the
federal
government
has
been
operating
on
an
understanding
for
years--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--it
would
in
that,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes,
the
federal
scheme
is
keyed
to
the
agreement
of
the
parties.
the
federal
banking
examiners,
when
they
go
out
and
decide
whether
or
not
something
is
payable
only
outside
the
united
states,
will
look
to
see
if
there
is
an
agreement.
if
there
is
no
agreement
they
assume
that
the
separate
entity
doctrine,
which
the
banking
system
has
followed
for
decades,
applies,
and
that
the
agreement
is...
the
deposit
is
payable
only
outside
the
united
states.
this
entire
structure
has
been
built
up
on
that
premise.
the
eurodollar
market
exists
on
that
premise.
if
the
rule
were
to
the
contrary
it
would
have
serious
implications
for
the
united
states
banking
system
because
it
would
mean
that
foreign
governments
could
expropriate
or
place
freeze
orders
on
the
assets--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--that
is
our
understanding,
your
honor.
but
if
that
turned
out
to
be
mistaken,
it
would
have
very
serious
implications
for
the
integrity
of
the
banking
system.
it
would
mean,
for
example,
that
a
foreign
government...
united
states
banks
do
business
in
many,
many
foreign
governments
that
are
subject
to
all
sorts
of
political
and
economic
instability.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
it's
unclear,
justice
white,
and
that's...
that
proposition
has
never
been
tested.
the
federal
reserve
has
broad
authority
over
branch
banks
in
foreign
governments.
it
can
specify
the
terms
and
conditions
under
which
those
branch
banks
operate.
and
it
is
conceivable
that
that
statutory
authority
would
be
broad
enough
to
justify
the
issuance
of
a
preemptive
rule.
but
it
is
not
the
understanding
of
the
federal
reserve
that
it
has
at
this
point
issued
such
a
rule.
its
understanding
is
that
it
has
been
following
the
agreement
of
the
parties,
and
that
the
agreement
of
the
parties,
when
there
is
no
express
agreement
of
the
parties
to
the
contrary,
that
the
intention
is
that
the
deposit
is
payable--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--our
understanding,
justice
stevens,
is
that
a
deposit
in
a
branch
in
a
foreign
bank
is
always
payable
at
that
branch,
and
thus
is
always
subject
to
the
law
of
that
branch.
if
a
credit
risk
occurred--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--our
position
is
that
if
it
were
payable
in
whole
or
in
part
in
the
united
states
it
would
not
be
payable
only
outside
the
united
states.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
if
there
were
express
agreement
to
that
effect,
that
is
correct.
if
there
were
a
guarantee
of
payment
at
the
home
office,
that
is
correct.
