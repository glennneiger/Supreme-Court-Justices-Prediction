justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
take
it
wells
fargo
supports
the
district
court's
rationale?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
are
the
risks
that
he
takes?
just
the
risk
of
a
foreign
freeze
order?
because
everyone
concedes
that
if
the
foreign
branch
is
insolvent
that
the
primary
branch,
that
the
primary
bank
is
liable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
what
are
the
risks?
just
a
foreign
freeze
order?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
can
you
say
then
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
disagree
with
any
of
the
findings
of
the
district
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
that...
in
short
there
was
an
agreement.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that
is
going
to
have
to
be
done
back
at
the
court
of
appeals,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
you,
your
position
is
you
could
not
have
gone
to
the
manila
counter
and
demanded
payment
at
the
manila
counter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
still,
i
still
find
it
hard
to
understand
why,
if
the
new
york
domestic
branches
are
fully
liable
for
all
eurodollars,
there
are
no...
under
any
contingency,
that
there
are
no
reserves
required.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
based
on
what
you
say,
then,
the
federal
reserve
assumes
that
deposits
are
safer
in
france
than
they
are
in
new
york.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you...
i
think
you
say
that
the
federal
reserve
understanding
is
just
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
if
the...
if
the
federal
reserve
board
had
been
asked
how
this
case
should
come
out
you
would
say
they
would
have
said
just
like
the
second
circuit
did?
