mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
citibank
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
the
outcome
of
this
case
will
be
of
tremendous
importance
to
the
banking
industry
and
to
federal
regulators,
but
the
case
is
not
complex.
what
happened
was
this.
wells...
the
respondent,
wells
fargo
asia
limited,
made
two
deposits
totalling
$2
million,
eurodollars,
in
citibank's
manila
branch.
before
the
time
came
for
repayment
the
philippine
government
entered
a
decree
that
made
it
impossible
for
us
to
repay
in
full.
now,
at
that
point
wells
fargo
asia
sued
citibank
in
new
york,
saying
that
since
the
manila
branch
could
not
pay,
citibank
in
new
york
had
to
pay.
we,
of
course,
think
the
risk
of
what
the
philippine
government
did
was
on
the
depositor
in
the
foreign
branch,
in
the
manila
branch.
now,
a
panel
of
the
second
circuit
stated
that
normally
a
deposit
is
repayable
only
at
the
branch
where
it
is
made,
but
in
this
case,
because
there
were
routing
instructions,
routine
routing
instructions
for
putting
the
money
back
through
new
york
on
the
way
to
repayment,
that
they
had
somehow...
the
banks
had
somehow
agreed
to
repay
in
new
york--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--that's
right.
they
found
there
was
a
contract.
and
what
that
contract
was,
a
routing
instruction,
it
was
a
little
odd
because
the
routing
instruction
said
that
citibank
manila
would
pay
out
of
its
bank
account
in
citibank...
its
bank
account,
not
citibank,...
its
bank
account
in
citibank,
would
repay
wells
fargo
asia's
bank
account
with
wells
fargo.
but
simply
because
it
went
through
new
york
the
second
circuit
decided
that
it
was
payable
in
new
york,
and
then
shifted
the
person
who
had
to
pay
from
citibank
manila
to
citibank
in
new
york.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
i
think
in
this
case
what
is
up
for
review
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
it
is
our
contention
that
that
question
of
law,
when
they
construed
that
as
a
contract,
is
preempted
by
federal
law.
and
you
will
notice,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
nobody
in
this
case
defends
the
second
circuit's
rationale.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
could
agree
otherwise
than
by
contract.
as
we
have
said
in
our
brief
and
as
the
solicitor
general
says,
this
is
clearly
not
a
contract.
these
are
the
routing
instructions
that
are
used
in--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--yes,
but
according
to
federal
law,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
i
am
saying
is
this
cannot
be
a
contract.
if
it
has
been,
then
for
40
years
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
fdic
have
been
interpreting
these
things
wrong.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
we
couldn't,
your
honor.
what
we
have
here,
all
of
these
dollars
are
routed
through
new
york,
90
percent
of
them.
that
is
the
way
the
whole
industry
works.
if
this
were
correct,
all
eurodollars,
which
are
payable
offshore
only,
suddenly
hundreds
of
billions
of
dollars
suddenly
become
payable
in
new
york.
those
are
deposits
offshore
for
which
no
reserves
have
been
created,
for
which
no
insurance
has
been
paid--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--already
out
there.
so
you
couldn't
cure
the
existing
obligations
by
contract.
moreover,
this
is
an
oral
market.
all
of
these
deals
are
done,
and
there
are
hundreds
of
billions
of
them
done
a
day,
on
the
telephone
by
people
who
are
about
25
years
old.
and
all
they
are
allowed
to
do
is
give
the
amount,
the
interest
rate
and
the
time
of
repayment.
there
are
no
other
terms.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
they're
not.
that's
it.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
they
are
not
allowed
by
their
employer
to
make
contracts
other
than
the
amount,
the
interest
rate
and
the
time
of
repayment.
it
is
an
oral
market,
and
it
can't
work
with
all
kinds
of
terms
being
done
that
way.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
never
gets...
i
assume
that
if
somebody
gets
out
of
line
and
makes
a
different
kind
of
a
contract
over
the
telephone
that
drastic
repercussions
follow.
but
that
is
not
the
point
here.
the
point
is
that
we
have
federal
law
that
says
that
these
deposits
are
payable
only
overseas
at
the
branch
where
made,
when
a
sovereign
foreign
government
interferes
with
the
power
of
the
branch
to
repay.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
certainly
true,
justice
o'connor.
the
solicitor
general
says
he
finds
our
rule
attractive...
and
by
the
way,
i
am
not
arguing
primarily
for
a
federal
common
law
rule.
i
am
arguing
primarily
for
a
straight
out
preemption,
which
i
think
i
can
prove.
but
the
solicitor
general
says
you
don't
have
to
reach
that
issue
because
the
common
law,
correctly
interpreted,
would
give
us
the
same
result.
and
he
does
stress
that
there
in
an
enormous
federal
interest
here.
if
you
look
at
page
12
of
his
brief,
page
18
of
his
brief,
and
towards
the
end
of
the
brief,
he
says
if
the
common
law
doesn't
come
out
right
they
will
have
to
come
back
and
begin
discussing
whether
or
not
there
is
a
federal
law
that
preempts,
or
that
there
is
a
common
law.
the
fact
is
his
position
rests
upon
a
notion
that
the
law
is
the
same
all
over
the
world
and
in
all
states.
that
may
be
true,
but
nobody
knows
it.
and
he
may
be
willing
to
rest
on
that,
but
the
banks
and
the
banking
regulators
would
find
that
situation
present...
nobody
would
know
where
the
risk--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--yes,
and
there
is
a
bank
statute
that
says
that--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--for
jurisdiction,
and
also
i
think
there
was
diversity
jurisdiction
here.
but--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--yes.
i
think
that
is
right,
justice
o'connor.
but
the
fact
is
the
second
circuit's
theory
is
one
i
had
not
planned
to
discuss,
because
nobody
in
this
case,
not
the
respondent,
the
amici,
the
respondent's
amici,
our
amici,
the
government,
nobody
supports
the
second
circuit's
rationale,
and
nobody
has
ever
seen
that
rationale
before
in
this
entire
market.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
wells
fargo
has
something
more
than
the
district
court's
rationale.
it
has
a
really
a
very
revolutionary
proposition.
but
even
without
a...
it's
not
really
the
district
court's
rationale,
i
don't
think,
but
even
without
an
agreement,
a
deposit
in
manila
is
repayable
by
citibank
in
new
york
or
anywhere
else
in
the
world
that
citibank
has
a
branch,
whenever
any
foreign
government
interferes
with
repayment
by
the
manila
branch.
now
that...
that
theory
absolutely
destroys
the
distinction
between
domestic
deposits
and
deposits
overseas
in
foreign
branches.
and
that
is
a
distinction
upon
which
the
banking
industry
in
this
area
is
built.
it
is
the
distinction
upon
which
all
federal
regulation
in
this
area
is
built.
and
in
this
case
you
have
two
federal...
you
have
two
regulatory
systems.
you
have
the
philippine
regulatory
system,
which
fully
regulates
the
manila
branch,
and
you
have
the
u.s.
regulatory
system.
now,
a
depositor
faces
a
trade-off,
depending
on
which
system
he
wants
to
choose
to
go
into.
deposit
here
and
get
all
of
the
protections,
reserves,
insurance
and
so
forth
that
the
united
states
provides,
or
he
can
deposit
abroad,
without
the
cost
of
the
u.s.
regulatory
system
and
get
a
higher
interest
rate.
what
he
can't
do
is
get
both.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
right.
that
is
right,
by
federal
law
there,
too.
in
1917
the
federal
reserve
stated--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--foreign
expropriation,
freeze,
anything
that
restricts
the
ability
of
the
foreign
branch
to
repay
the
debt
when
it
is
due.
that
is
called
sovereign
risk,
and
that
is
what
the
government
has
said,
by
law,
rests
with
the
depositor
and
not
with
the
home
office.
and
it
can't
operate
its
regulatory
system
any
other
way,
because
if
all
of
those
deposits
suddenly
become
payable
in
the
united
states,
perhaps
the
federal
reserve
will
have
to
create
reserves
against
those
deposits,
and
there
are
hundreds
of
billions
of
them
out
there.
citibank,
for
example,
and
it
is
not
alone
in
this,
has
many
more
deposits
overseas
than
it
has
in
this
country.
and
if
they
all
came
here
to
be
repaid
after
they
were
lost
to
a
foreign
government,
the
situation
would
be
pretty
serious.
so,
if
respondent's
theory
were
adopted,
what
would
happen
is
that
the
federal
reserve
board
would
have
to
figure
out
whether
it
is
going
to
require
reserves
against
all
of
those
deposits.
the
fdic
would
have
no
choice
under
its
statute.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
no,
actually
general
merrill
is
going
to
address
that
aspect
of
the
case,
and
i
had
hoped
to
discuss
the
federal
law,
but
i
am
willing
to
discuss
it
too
if
you
wish.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
the,
that's
in
the
case,
but
i
think
by
federal
law
that
is
not
the
way
to
view
standard
routing
instructions,
because
if
you
do
all
eurodollars
are
wiped
out
and
they
all
become
domestic
dollars.
but
anyway,
the
law
in
this
case
was
made
in
1913
by
the
federal
reserve
act,
which
delegated
to
the
federal
reserve
board
the
power
to
license
foreign
branches
under
such
regulations,
upon
such
conditions
as
they
saw
fit.
the
federal
reserve
board
then--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
mr.
chief
justice:
since
general
merrill
is
going
to
discuss
the
issue
of
the
routing
instructions,
i
would
like
not
to
use
up
all
of
my
time
on
that
issue.
but
i
want
to
say
just
a
couple
of
things.
there
is
only
one
finding
of
fact
in
this
case
about
what
those
routing
instructions
mean.
that
was
by
the
district
court.
the
district
court
found
as
a
fact
that
was
not
an
agreement
making
the
deposits
collectable
in
new
york.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
find
that
clearly
erroneous,
it
simply
read
the
words
of
the
telexes
and
said
that's
an
agreement.
i
think
that
is
a
matter
of
law,
not
of
fact.
and
these
are
routine
transactions,
and
i
think
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
they
cannot
be
taken
as
agreements.
and
in
fact
i
think
federal
law
covers
this
entire
field
i
have
mentioned
to
you,
congress'
delegation
to
the
federal
reserve
board
to
make
all
the
regulations
as
to
foreign
banks.
the
federal
reserve
board
did
that
in
its
most...
its
clearest
statement
of
federal
law
was
in
its
1970
bulletin
opinion,
which
is
to
be
found
at
page
87
of
the
appendix,
and
i
will
quote
just
three
sentences
from
that.
it
said
said
exemptions,
that
is,
exemptions
from...
for
foreign
branches
from
reserve
requirements
and
exemptions
from
interest
rate
limits,
are
intended
principally
to
enable
foreign
branches
of
u.s.
banks
to
compete
on
a
more
nearly
equal
basis
with
other
banks
in
foreign
countries
in
accordance
with
the
laws
and
regulations
of
those
countries.
having
given
the
policy
of
federal
interest,
a
federal
policy
in
having
competitive
foreign
branches,
in
the
very
next
sentence
the
opinion
goes
on
to
say,
to
lay
out
the
law,
a
customer
who
makes
a
deposit
that
is
payable
solely
at
a
foreign
branch
assumes
whatever
risk
may
exist
that
the
foreign
country
might
impose
restrictions
on
withdrawals.
to
make
it
still
clearer,
the
very
next
sentence
says
when
payment
of
a
deposit
in
a
foreign
branch
is
guaranteed
by
a
promise
of
payment
at
a
banking
office
in
the
united
states
if
not
paid
at
the
foreign
office,
the
depositor
no
longer
assumes
such
risk.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
it
is
an
interpretation
of
the
1918
opinion,
which
is
a
regulation,
and
then
you
will
have...
i
think
this
is
a
regulation.
i
think
you
will
see
in
1982
and
1983
in
the
appendix
staff
opinions
published
by
authority
of
the
board
which
say
the
same
thing.
they...
but
the
important
point
is
the
matter
of
practical
construction
for
decades
and
decades,
since
1918
to
the
present
day,
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
fdic
since
1933
have
been
operating
on
that
rule.
and
among
other
things,
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
fdic
for
40
years
have
been
saying
that
these
routing
instructions,
which
every
day
send
$750
billion
through
new
york,
every
day,
these
routing
instructions
are
not
agreements
to
repay
in
the
united
states.
and
the
finding...
the
holding
to
the
contrary
by
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think,
is
clearly
a
holding
of
law
and
not
a
finding
of
fact.
but
in
any
event,
our
brief
discusses
how
the
law
was
made
at
some
length,
and
congress
has
ratified
in
1980
these
interpretations
and
these
regulations.
that
is
in
our
brief,
too.
the
clear
fact
is
that
federal
law
had
to
be
created,
if
we
were
going
to
have
eurodollar
markets,
if
we
were
going
to
have
foreign
branches
that
are
competitive
with
other
countries.
other
countries
don't
have
a
rule
of
home
office
liability.
the
risk
of
sovereign
interference
under
english
law
and
under
french
law
rests
with
the
depositor
in
the
foreign
branch.
that
was
the
rule
here
up
until
this
case.
but
it
is
clearly
the
rule
that
the
federal
reserve
and
the
fdic
have
laid
down
and
operate
on.
now,
if
the
court
of...
if
this
court--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--if
it's
made
at
the
foreign
branch--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--if
it's...
under
the
1917
regulation
of
the
federal
reserve
board,
if
there
is
insolvency
or
a
credit
failure,
it
is
payable
by
the
home
office.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
in
terms
of
sovereign
risk,
because
of
the
1918
regulation
which
said
that
the
reserves
will
not
be
created
by
sovereign--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--he
assumes
the
risk.
the
risk
he
assumes
is
that
the
foreign
country
might
interfere
with
repayment.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
he
does
not
assume
the
risk
if
the
branch
manager
will
run
off
with
the
funds.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
oh,
it
probably
is
payable...
well,
under...
that
is
probably
justice
harlan's
distinction
he
made,
it's
in
our
brief,
which
is
that
it
is
not
payable
at
the
home
office.
you
sue
at
the
home
office
for
breach
of
contract,
recision,
something
of
that
sort.
but
it
is
not
the
deposit
itself
that
is
repayable.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
this
one
wasn't,
then
none
are.
and
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
and
the
federal
reserve
board
have
been
operating
under
their
own
regulations
for
decades
and
decades
on
a
wrong
interpretation
of
their
own
regulations.
because
this
is
an
utterly
standard
routing
instruction,
utterly
standard
transaction.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
no,
the
court
has...
here
has
said
it
is
payable
out
of
the
home
office
funds,
although
the
telexes
don't
say
that.
they
say
payable
out
of
manila
branch's
funds.
and
the
transfer,
the
electronic
transfer,
takes
place
in
new
york
because
of
this
computer
system
that
nets
out
$750
billion
worth
of
these
eurodollar
transactions
a
day.
that
is
why
they
all
go
through
new
york,
and
the
only
reason.
and
that
practical
industry
fact
has
been
understood
by
the
regulatory
agencies
not
to
be
a
contract
that
the
home
office
will
pay.
if
the
court
should
rule
as
we
ask
the
court
to,
nothing
in
the
regulatory
system
that
has
been
in
place
for
decades
now
will
change.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
you
would
reverse
and
judgment
would
be
entered
for
citibank.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
right.
that
is
right,
mr.
justice
white.
if
the
court
should
rule
the
other
way,
however,
on
these
notions
that
respondent
offers,
which
are
essentially
unworkable,
they
don't
do...
for
example,
it
says
an
attachment
of
a
deposit,
the
risk
of
that
is
on
the
depositor,
but
a
currency
blocking,
the
risk
of
that
is
on
the
home
office.
you
can
block
currency
for
so
long
it
becomes
an
attachment.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
that
is
correct.
the
risk
of
laws
rests
with
the
depositor.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
if
it
did--
mr.
robert
h.
bork
--well,
i
don't
think
the
new
york
law
is
that
way.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
but
if
it
were
i
think
that
new
york
law
is
preempted
because
a
foreign
branch
banking
is
an
area
of
vital
federal
interest.
these
branches
exist
only
because
of
congress
and
the
federal
reserve
board.
and
they
have
been
regulated
by
congress
and
the
federal
reserve
board
all
of
this
time.
and
congress
said
it
wants
healthy
competitive
foreign
branches
to
help
assist
american
business,
to
act
as
fiscal
agents
to
the
u.s.
government,
and
so
forth.
this
is
the
area
of
almost
exclusive
federal
concern,
and
there
is
federal
rules
on
it
which
i
think
must
preempt
any
rules
to
the
contrary.
it
is
a
very
narrow
preemption.
it
is
just
about
where
the
risk
of
sovereign
laws
lies.
mr.
robert
h.
bork
well,
the
statute
in
1913
said
that
the
federal
reserve
may
license
foreign
branches
on
such
regulations
and
conditions
as
it
deems
necessary.
the
federal
reserve
then
began
to
make
opinions
and
regulations
of
the
kind
i
just
read
you,
which
says
the
risk
of
sovereign
interference
at
the
branch
lies
solely
with
the
depositor.
in
1980
congress
passed
the
statute
saying
reserves...
following
the
federal
reserve
practice...
reserves
are
not
creatable
for
deposits
of
foreign
branches.
and
the
house
report
said
that
it
is
our
intention
not
to
disturb
the
administrative
classifications
that
have
been
made
under
existing
law,
which
i
think
is
a
ratification
of
what
the
federal
reserve
and
the
fdic
had
been
doing
all
of
this
time.
