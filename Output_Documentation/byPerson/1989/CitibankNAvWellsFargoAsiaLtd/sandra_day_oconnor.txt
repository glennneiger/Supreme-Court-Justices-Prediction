well,
mr.
bork,
i
think
the
solicitor
general
would
offer
a
narrower
approach
than
the
adoption
of
some
federal
common
law
rule.
i
think
you
differ
somewhat
in
that
regard.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
was
the
source
of
federal
jurisdiction
here?
was
it
diversity
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
relying
on
section
632?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
think
both
existed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
merrill,
in
responding
to
the
question
you
take
a
different
position
than
mr.
bork
takes
in
how
we
should
resolve
it.
he
would
propose
articulation
of
some
federal
common
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
it
isn't...
if
we
don't
say,
as
he
suggests,
that
there,
it
is
governed
by
some
federal
law,
then
what
law
does
apply
here?
