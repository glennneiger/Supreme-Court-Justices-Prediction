chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
89-624,
maislin
industries
v.
primary
steel.
mr.
auchincloss.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
was
the
basis
of
the
commission's
determination
that
this
was
an
unreasonable
practice?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
was
the
reasoning
of
the
icc?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
just...
that,
frankly,
sounds
like
jargon
to
me.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
may
have...
i...
perhaps...
the
court
has
been
known
to
reason
in
jargon.
[laughter]
but
can
you
explain
it
in
any
more
comprehensible
language?
try
hard,
mr.
auchincloss.
you're
not
really
trying.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
icc
used
10701
for
this.
it
says
a
rate
must
be
reasonable.
chief
justice
rehnquist
who
could...
well,
why
can't
the
icc
take
a
new
look
at
the
thing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
but
why
can't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did...
didn't
this
carrier
promise
to
file
the
tariff
that
he
negotiated
with
the
shipper?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
was
no
finding
in
any...
either
the
agency
or
the
lower
courts
on
this
point?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
not
directly,
what
do
you
mean?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
auchincloss.
mr.
merrill.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
merrill,
mr.
auchincloss
said
there
was
no
evidence
in
this
case
that
the...
there
was
ever
any
agreement
on
the
part
of
the
shipper
and
the
carrier
that
the
carrier
would
file
the
tariff,
file
the
new
rate.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the
commission
found
that
the
shipper
relied
on
the
carrier.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
merrill.
mr.
auchincloss,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
auchincloss.
the
case
is
submitted.
