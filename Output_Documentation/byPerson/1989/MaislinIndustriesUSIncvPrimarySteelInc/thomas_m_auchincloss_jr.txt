mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
asks
whether
a
shipper
who
utilizes
the
services
of
a
motor
common
carrier
has
a
legal
right
to
the
benefit
of
an
unfiled
illegal
rate,
or
must
the
shipper
pay
the
carrier's
lawful
tariff
rate.
quinn
freight
lines,
one
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
was
a
motor
common
carrier
that
conducted
operations
in
interstate
commerce
pursuant
to
authority
granted
by
the
icc
and
under
tariffs
on
file
with
the
icc.
the
respondents
are
a
shipper,
primary
steel,
who
utilized
the
services
of
quinn,
and
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
the
facts
in
this
case
indicate
that
primary
and
quinn
negotiated
rates
for
the
transportation
of
steel
products
from
a
point
in
connecticut
to
destinations
in
12
states.
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
quinn
did
not
file
its
rates
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
transportation
was
performed
over
a
period
of
nearly
three
years,
and
roughly
1,100
shipments
were
transported.
following
the
bankruptcy
of
maislin
and
quinn,
it
was
discovered
by
the
rate
auditors
who
were
retained
by
the
estate
of
maislin
that
the
transportation
charges
assessed
quinn...
assessed
primary
by
quinn
were
in
fact
not
on
file
in
tariffs
on
file
with
the
icc.
now,
the
rate
auditors
made
demand
for
payment
of
undercharges,
that
is
the
difference
between
the
filed
tariff
rates
and
the
unfiled
rates
that
were
assessed
on
the
carrier's
freight
bills.
primary
refused
to
pay
the
undercharges,
and
an
action
was
instituted
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
the
district
of
missouri,
kansas
city
specifically.
the
district
court,
upon
motion
of
primary,
referred
three
issues
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission
for
consideration.
first,
whether
quinn's
rates,
applicable
filed
tariff
rates
that
is,
were
in
fact
applicable
to
the
shipments
transported
by
primary,
or
by
quinn
on
behalf
of
primary;
second,
whether
quinn's
rates
were
reasonable
pursuant
to
standards
established
under
the
interstate
commerce
act;
and
third,
whether
quinn
would
be
barred
from
the
collection
of
its
undercharges
by
virtue
of
two
provisions
contained
in
the
interstate
commerce
act:
first,
section
10701,
which
relates
to
carrier
practices,
reasonable
rates
and
so
on,
and
secondly,
the
so-called
tariff
requirement
act,
or
provision
of
the
act,
which
is
section
10761
of
the
act.
in
an
advisory
decision
issued
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
the
commission
ignored
the
applicability
issue
and
the
rate
reasonableness
issue,
and
instead
decided
that
the
carrier
should
be
foreclosed
from
collecting
its
undercharges,
based
solely
on
the
language
of
section
10701
of
the
act,
which
again
is
that
provision
which
requires
carriers'
rates
and
practices
to
be
reasonable.
following
the
advisory
decision,
the
district
court
issued
its
decision
in
which
it
upheld
the
icc
advisory
opinion,
noting
also
that
the
negotiated
rate
proposition
was
an
unreasonable
practice
and
in
fact
foreclosed
the
carrier
from
collecting
its
undercharges.
the
court
also
held
that
there
was
no
provision
contained
in
the
interstate
commerce
act
which
foreclosed
the
commission
from
issuing
a
policy
statement
which
in
effect
said
that
it
would
henceforth
consider
equitable
defenses
to
carriers'
efforts
to
collect
lawful
tariff
charges.
on
appeal
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district
court's
decision
for
essentially
the
same
reasons.
now,
the
contact
which
gives
rise
to
this
case,
an
agreement
between
a
common
carrier
and
a
shipper
to
do
business
at
a
rate
other
than
the
lawful
filed
tariff
rate,
is
explicitly
prohibited
by
the
interstate
commerce
act.
in
upholding
the
district
court's
decision,
the
court
of
appeals
failed
to
recognize
the
extremely
narrow
relief
offered
to
shippers
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
for
the
recovery
of
reparations
or
undercharges
on
past
motor
common
carrier
shipments.
congress
has
created
a
mechanism,
a
statutory
framework,
in
fact,
under
which
shippers
and
motor
carriers
will
conduct
their
business.
the
essence
of
that
framework
is
the
common
carrier's
tariff.
all
transactions
between
shippers
and
motor
carriers
must
be
conducted
pursuant
to
explicit
tariff
provisions.
the
carrier--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--that's
section
10761
of
the
act,
your
honor.
carriers
cannot
perform
a
service.
they
cannot
perform
transportation
unless
there
are
explicit
provisions
in
the
tariff
which
underlie
that
service
or
that
transportation.
all
dealings
conducted
pursuant
to
the
tariff,
of
course,
are
subject
to
scrutiny,
either
by
the
icc
or
by
other
shippers
or
carriers
who
would
have
an
interest
in
what
the
common
carrier's
holding
out
may
be.
failure
to
adhere
to
the
filed
tariff
can
result
in
civil
penalties
or
criminal
penalties.
that
is
why
we
say
in
our
reply
brief
in
this
instance
that
in
fact
the
unfiled
illegal
rate
is
the
antithesis
of
the
statutory
rate
policy
promulgated
by
the
congress.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
that
is
correct.
those
rates
are
available
for
anybody
who
would
utilize
the
services
of
a
common
carrier.
that
is
precisely
what
the
act
intends.
the
act
intends
equality
of
treatment
between
shippers,
and
it
is
intended
to
avoid
discrimination
by
permitting
carriers
and
shippers
to
engage
in
these
secret
rate
agreements
which
foreclose
from
public
view
examination
of
the
rate
arrangements
under
which
a
shipper's
transportation
is
performed.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
that
is
correct.
well,
prior
to
t.i.m.e.,
and
t.i.m.e.
held
that
shippers
had
no
recourse
for
transportation
rates
that
were
applicable
to
past
transportation.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
but
they
now
do.
in
1965--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--well,
it's
the
governing
rate
until
the
interstate
commerce
commission,
upon
referral
from
a
district
court
in
the
instance
of
a
motor
carrier
or
a
motor
common
carrier,
determines
that
the
carrier's
rate
was
either
not
applicable
or
was
unreasonable.
there
are
explicit
provisions
in
the
act
now
which
are
the
result
of
the
1965
legislation,
which
provide
a
mechanism
by
which
shippers
can
ask
the
commission
whether
or
not
a
carrier's
rates
applicable
to
its
past
shipments
were
reasonable
or
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
the
provisions
in
the
act
which
congress
formulated
provide
shippers
with
a
very
narrow
remedy
for
the
relief
that
you
suggest,
as
for
relief
in
a
prospective
fashion,
or
whether
or
not
it's
an
attack
upon
an
existing
rate.
i
mean,
there
are
other
provisions
in
the
act
which
provide
specifically
how
that
mechanism
should
operate
to
give
shippers
relief.
there
are
provisions
that
relate
specifically
to...
investigation
and
suspension
proceedings,
complaint
proceedings.
and
in
this
instance,
upon
referral
from
a
district
court,
whether
or
not
a
carrier's
rates
are
reasonable
or
unreasonable.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
everybody
who
has
been
charged
that
rate
would
certainly
have
a
cause
of
action.
that
is
correct.
there
is
a
rule
of
rate-making,
contained
in
section
10701(c),
i
believe
it
is,
of
the
act,
which
provides
specific
standards
by
which
the
commission
must
evaluate
the
reasonableness
of
carriers'
rates,
whether
prospective
or
future
application,
or
whether
in
the
instance
of
past
transportation
performed
on
behalf
of
a
shipper,
precisely
what
rates,
or
what
levels
of
rates
are
reasonable
for
that
transportation.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
whether
you
are
talking
in
a
hypothetical
sense,
your
honor,
whether
or
not--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--well,
in
that
connection
i
should
say
that
in
the
interstate
commerce
commission
proceeding
evidence
was
submitted
on
referral
from
the
district
court
addressing
the
reasonableness
of
the
carrier's
rates.
in
fact
extensive
cost
evidence
was
submitted
which
established,
according
to
the
expert
retained
by
the
quinn
estate,
that
the
rates
were
within
a
so-called
zone
of
reasonableness.
given
that,
those
rates
are
in
fact
just
and
reasonable
under
the
standards
of
the
act.
an
operating
ratio
based
on
a
revenue
cost
basis
was
produced
which
indicated
that
the
composite
revenue
expense
experience
for
that
transportation
produced
an
operating
ratio
of
96.3
percent.
so
in
this
particular
case,
the
shipper
has
had
that
determination.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
that
is
correct.
well,
again,
that
opportunity
was
before
the
commission.
i
mean,
the
commission
had
ample
opportunity,
and
the
shipper
had
two
occasions
to
object
to
the
commission's
failure
to
reach
a
determination
on
rate
reasonableness.
first
it
could
have
taken
exception
to
the
commission
decision,
which
in
fact
didn't
address
the
matter
of
rate
reasonableness.
it
let
that
opportunity
pass.
when
the
district
court
took
the
advisory
decision
and
in
effect
made
it
its
own,
it
took
no
exception
at
the
district
court
level
to
that
same
absence
of
rate
determination.
so
in
fact,
as
i
have
already
indicated,
there
were
three
issues
presented
to
the
district
court.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
that...
that's
precisely
the
case.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
that's
exactly
it.
and
in
fact,
a
reference
to
the
record
in
the
case
indicates
quite
clearly.
there
is
testimony
presented
by
a
cost
expert,
and
of
course,
the
shipper
presented
his
own
cost
expert,
who
developed
evidence
trying
to
show
that
the
carrier's
rate
was
not
reasonable.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
oh,
we
wouldn't
be
here
today.
i
mean,
if
the
commission
had
made
a
determination
that
the
carrier's
rate
was
not
reasonable,
there
would
be
no
cause
of
action.
in
fact,
the
commission
has
primary
jurisdiction
to
consider
the
issue
of
rate
reasonableness.
and
we
concede
that.
there
is
absolutely
no
question
about
that.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
the
commission
has
taken
section
10701(a)
of
the
act,
which
requires
that
carrier
rates,
classifications,
rules
and
practices
be
reasonable.
it
has
tied
that
together
with
its
alleged
primary
jurisdiction.
and
the
district
court
bought
this
and
the
court
of
appeals
bought
it,
and
on
the
basis
of
that
simply
say
that
we
can
negate
the
application
of
a
filed
rate
by
virtue
of
our
rate
reasonableness
and
practice
reasonableness
jurisdiction,
and
in
effect
not
hold
that
carrier
to
collection
of
its
legal
charges.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
the
reasoning
is
essentially
that,
that
it
has
jurisdiction
under
10701
to
determine
whether
carrier
practices
are
reasonable.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
there
was
an
agreement,
but
it
was
never
reduced
to
tariff
form.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
that
is
correct,
but--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--that's
what
they
say,
but--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--well,
this
court
has
held
on
at
least
two
occasions,
certainly
in
t.i.m.e.
and
montana-dakota,
that
rate
reasonableness
or
practice
reasonableness
is
not
a
justiciable
legal
right.
it
is
simply
a
criterion
for
application
in
an
administrative
proceeding
to
determine
a
lawful
rate.
the
court--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--well,
it
is
the
court's
reasoning,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
well,
you
have
to
look
at
the
framework,
again,
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
10761
is
intended
to
keep
the
dealings
of
carriers
and
shippers
open
to
the
public.
the
commission
says
the
carrier
engaged
in
an
unreasonable
practice
by
failing
to
bill
its
tariff
rate,
and
therefore
the
shipper's
entitled
to
this
relief.
we
contend
that
congress
has
made
no
such
provision.
maxwell,
of
course,
and
the
cases
that
have
come
down
since
maxwell,
are
quite
clear
on
the
point
that
the
shipper...
his
legal
right
is
measured
by
the
applicable
lawful
tariff.
now,
he
has
a
mechanism
under
the
interstate
commerce
act,
and
particularly
in
this
instance
if
it
was
past
transportation,
past
transportation
charges,
to
allege
in
a
carrier
suit
for
undercharges
that
the
carrier's
rate
was
unreasonable.
and
when
confronted
with
that
the
district
court
has
to
refer
that
issue
to
the
icc.
and
if
a
rate
reasonableness
determination
is
reached,
then,
of
course,
the
matter
is
resolved.
and
again,
as
justice
o'connor--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--well,
again,
that
is
not
an
explicit
command
to
do
anything
other
than
look
at
the
overall
practices
conducted
by
carriers
in
terms
of
their
tariffs.
i
say...
this
is
certainly
recited
in
our
reply
brief,
all
of
the
practices
of
carriers
must
in
one
way
or
another
be
attached
to
its
tariff.
it
is
a
fact
that
a
carrier
cannot
engage
in
a
practice
that
does
not
have
some
relation
to
its
tariff.
this
is
an
agreement
outside
of
the
tariff.
it
has
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
whether
or
not--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--well,
it
has
in
this
instance,
obviously.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
again,
we
say
this
is
not
what
congress
intended.
10761
requires
strict
adherence
to
the
filed
tariff.
it
is
the
mechanism
by
which
all
of
this
business
is
transacted.
and
looking
at
a
billing
practice,
and
i
suppose
there
are
many
practices
carriers
might
engage
in
that
conceivably
have
some
bearing
on
its
general
holding
out,
but
not
something
so
central
as
whether
or
not
a
general
provision
like
rate
reasonableness
can
negate
the
application
of
a
very
specific
requirement
that
tariffs
maintain
rates
which
are
available
for
the
public
generally.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
that
is
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
presumably,
and
it's...
it's
really
not
in
the
record,
but--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--well,
the
holding
out
of
the
carrier
was
its
filed
tariff
on
file
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
i
would
say
this,
that
there
was
evidence,
or
there
is
evidence
presented
in
the
commission
proceeding
that
dealt
with
the
carrier's
billing
practices
generally,
and
there
were
allegations
made
in
the
commission
proceeding
that
the
carrier
was
engaged
in
some
kind
of
nefarious
conduct
which
sought
to
avoid
application
of
the
filed
rate
requirement.
however,
that
evidence
indicated
that
the
carrier's
billing
accuracy
was
over
95...
or
over
99
percent,
and
in
fact
most
of
the
transactions
presumably,
on
the
basis
of
that.
and
at
the
time
of
its
bankruptcy
the
carrier
was
doing
business
with
something
like
23,000
shippers.
so--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--no,
absolutely
not.
and--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--yes,
i
am
sure
there
were.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
the
carrier
had
rates
applicable--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--well,
of
course,
there
is
not
specific
evidence
in
the
record
to
answer
your
specific
question.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
not
specifically
as
it
relates
to
other
specific
shippers,
that's
correct.
i
should
say
also
that
the
matter
of
the
filed
rate
contained,
and
the
requirement
contained
in
10761
of
the
act
has
some
very
specific
exceptions
which
congress
has
also
put
into
the
interstate
commerce
act.
those
relate
specifically
to
the
conduct
of
carriers
pursuant
to
tariffs
or
at
arrangements
other
than
tariffs.
and
the
most
important
of
these
is
the
requirement
that...
or
the
authority
extended
to
the
commission
to
authorize
contract
carriers
to
conduct
business
at
schedules
that
are
not
on
file
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
there
are
two
explicit
provisions
in
section
10761
and
10762
which
relate
to
the
matter
of
relieving
contract
carriers
from
that
requirement.
so
that
specific
exemption,
we
believe,
stands
in
stark
contrast
to
what
the
commission
is
authorizing
by
virtue
of
its
alleged
authority
under
section
10701
of
the
act.
there
are
other
provisions
which
relate
specifically
to
transportation
by
household
goods
carriers
who
are
authorized
to
perform
their
transportation
at
free...
or
at
binding
estimates
which
need
not
relate
to
the
tariff.
they
are
simply
concocted
by
whatever
method
the
carrier
might
devise
in
order
to
arrive
at
its
reasonable
charges.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
it
was...
there
were
communications
between
the
carrier
and
the
shipper
in
which
they
agreed
that
the
transportation
charge
would
be
whatever
it
was.
that
was
reduced
to
some
handwritten
letter
form,
which
passed
between
the
two,
and
simply
recited
what
the
rates
would
be
by
destinations
from
the
connecticut
origin.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
that
situation
could
arise,
quite
obviously,
and
it
didn't
in
this
situation.
but
in
instances
in
which
the
carrier
alleges
he
is
going
to
file
his
tariff
and
he
doesn't,
and
it
is
later
discovered
that
this
situation
has
developed,
the
carrier,
or
the
shipper
has
recourse,
again
pursuant
to
the
provisions
in
the
act
which
permit
determinations
of
whether
or
not
that
carrier's
rate
is
reasonable
or
not.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
no,
there
was
no
explicit
promise
to
do
anything.
in
fact,
there
is
testimony
from
two
of
the
officials
of
the
shipper
who
simply
indicate
they
had
no
knowledge
of
tariffs.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
not
directly,
no.
i
mean--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--well,
i
mean
that
they
engaged
in
this
transaction
and
discussion
to
arrive
at
rates,
but
the
carrier
never
said,
and
it
was
never
reduced
to
any
written
form
or
other
form,
that
i
will
file
that
in
a
tariff
i
have
on
file
with
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
and
the
shipper,
again,
alleged
that
he
had
no
knowledge
of
tariffs.
so
the
question
apparently
didn't
arise
in
their
dealings
as
to
exactly
how
this
conduct
would
proceed.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
filed
rate
is
required
to
be
applied,
and
it's
available
to
all
shippers
who
would
utilize
the
service
of
that
carrier.
and,
of
course,
it
should
have
been
in
this
instance.
and
the
only
relief
available
to
the
shipper
is
a
determination
that
the
filed
rate
in
fact
was
not
just
and
reasonable.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
terms
it
a
billing
practice.
the
carrier's
practice
of
billing
rates
that
were
not
contained
in
its
tariff
was
an
unreasonable
practice.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
and
this--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
right.
well,
essentially,
again,
it
comes
in
the
form
of...
they
latch
onto
this
word
practice
contained
in
10701
of
the
act.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
the
commission
calls
it
a
billing
practice,
the
carrier's
billing
and
collection
practices.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
collect
what
they
should
have
under
the
filed
tariff.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
the
commission
says
the...
yes,
the
commission
says
that
the
billing
practice
which
the
carrier
engaged
in,
which
resulted
in
the
non-application
of
the
filed
rate,
resulted
in
the
carrier
charging
something
less,
and
the
carrier
should
be
foreclosed
from
collecting
its
undercharges.
that
is
the
difference
between
the
lower
quoted
rate
and
the
higher
filed
rate.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
the
commission
makes
no
suggestion
along
those
lines
at
all.
in
fact,
the
commission
has
been
opposed
to...
the
current
commission
at
least...
has
been
opposed
to
the
file
tariff
system
in
its
entirety.
they
have
made
statements
on
the
hill
that
they
think
this
is
a
process
that
doesn't
serve
the
procompetitive
aspects
of
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1980.
in
fact,
however,
we
say,
as
this
court
said
in
square
d,
if
that
is
a
matter
that
must
be
reviewed,
then
it
should
be
reviewed
by
congress.
congress,
in
enacting
the
1980
legislation,
made
it
clear
that
explicit
instructions
were
being
in
effect
issued
to
the
commission
to
follow
a
certain
course
of
conduct.
one
of
those
very
explicit
requirements
was
if
you
do
business
with
a
motor
common
carrier,
or
for
that
matter
a
railroad--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--well,
that
is
one
of
the
evils
of
this
case.
that
is
correct.
that
is
precisely
the
point.
what
would
stop
shippers
in
the
future
from
engaging
in
precisely
that
kind
of
conduct
with
carriers
who
were
willing
to
do
it?
you
can
do
your
business
as
a
common
carrier
on
the
strength
of
a
telephone
call
quotation
of
a
rate
or
a
letter
quotation
of
a
rate,
disregarding
what's
contained
in
the
tariff,
and
then
subsequently
alleging
that
well,
we
had
a
negotiated
rate,
so
it
really
doesn't
matter
what
my
tariff
provided.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
the
commission
says
that
it
is
not
overturning
or
modifying
to
any
significant
degree
the
carrier's
requirement...
the
common
carrier's
requirement
that
he
file
tariffs
with
the
commission
and
he
observes
those.
but,
of
course,
that
is
a
statement
in
the
breach.
it
is
not
a
statement
in
the
application.
because
in
fact
we
have
here--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--yes,
it
is.
it
is
a
penalty--
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
--it
could
be
civil,
if
there
is
intentional
misapplication
of
the
tariff.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
the
commission
has
powers
to
determine
what
practices
generally
may
result
in
violations
of
explicit
provisions
of
the
act,
but
they
must
be
explicit
provisions.
civil
penalties
and
criminal
penalties
attach
to
failure
of
a
carrier
to
apply
its
filed
tariff.
and
if
there
is
a
rebate
situation
involved,
that's
a
criminal
proposition.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
the
commission
could,
if
it
would.
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
well,
the
commission
has
not
been
enforcing
those
provisions
in
the
interstate
commerce
act,
your
honor.
the
commission
could
have
stopped
this
whole
process
early
on,
after
the
enactment
of
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1980,
if
the
commission
had
simply
made
examples
of
those
carriers
and
shippers
who
were
engaged
in
this
kind
of
conduct.
it
could
have
cited
them,
brought
them
to
court,
and
corrected
the
problem.
but
it
never
occurred.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
thomas
m.
auchincloss,
jr.
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think
it
is
well
to
look
at
the
hewitt-robins
case
in
light
of
the
government's
argument.
in
fact,
hewitt-robins
involved
a
practice,
the
practice
of
routing.
the
carrier
routed
interstate
shipments,
or
intrastate
shipments
over
an
interstate
route,
and
thereby
applied
a
higher
rate
than
was
applicable
under
its
interstate,
or
intrastate
route,
the
result
being,
and
this
is
what
this
court
held,
that
that
common
law
right
to
a
reasonable
route
exists
and
was
not
extinguished
by
the
enactment
of
the
interstate
commerce
act.
that's
the
kind
of
practice
the
commission
has
traditionally
looked
at,
and
that
is
the
kind
of
practice
the
court
has
looked
at
in
terms
of
what
is
a
lawful
proposition
versus
an
unlawful
proposition.
we
contend
here,
of
course,
that
in
fact
the
secret
rate
agreement
is
an
unlawful
proposition.
the
commission
and
the
courts
have
always
wrestled
with
practices
that
revolve
around
tariff
provisions,
not
around
secret
agreements.
the
government
says
that
the
culprit
in
this
is
the
carrier,
because
the
carrier
failed
to
follow
through
on
its
duty
to
file
a
tariff.
well,
in
fact
the
law
charges
shippers
with
knowledge
of
tariff
provisions
as
well,
and
primary
was
no
small
shipper.
the
record
indicates
it
shipped
43
million
pounds
via
this
carrier
over
a
nearly
three-year
period.
so
in
fact
the
conduct
that
we
are
talking
about
was
not
unreasonable
in
terms
of
the
carrier's
practice
solely.
it
was
the
shipper
who
neglected
to
even
ask
the
carrier
whether
or
not
it
had
a
tariff
applicable
to
this
movement,
notwithstanding
its
allegations
it
knew
nothing
about
the
law.
the
law
requires
this,
but
i
know
nothing
about
it.
it
made
shipments
to
united
states
steel,
one
of
the
largest
producers
in
the
country,
obviously,
and
notwithstanding
that
united
states
steel
undoubtedly
audits
its
freight
bills,
primary
says
it
didn't
have
to.
so
this
whole
process--
