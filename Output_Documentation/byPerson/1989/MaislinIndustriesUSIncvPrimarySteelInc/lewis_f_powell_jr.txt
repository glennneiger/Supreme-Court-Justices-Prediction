justice
jr.
well,
but
you
could
say
that
in
any
case
where
the
carrier
agrees
to
a
lower
rate,
doesn't
file
a
tariff
for
that
lower
rate,
and
then
bills
the
lower
rate.
you
could
say
there
has
been
an
unlawful
billing
practice.
but
i
had
thought
that
our
case
law
prevents
that.
i
had
thought
that
what
the
statute
means
is
you
have
to
bill
the
tariff
rate.
