justice
kennedy
in
this
case
is
there
evidence
that
the
parties
purported
to
be
negotiating
a
new
tariff?
or
was
it
just
an
agreement
to
discount
off
the
existing
tariff?
justice
kennedy
suppose
it
were
clear
from
the
course
of
dealing
that
the
parties
purported
to
be
agreeing
on
a
new
tariff
that
the
carrier
would
then
file,
and
then
the
carrier
just
neglects
to
file?
justice
kennedy
but
i
take
it
from
the
answer
you
gave
to
me
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
in
your
view
of
the
case
in
any
event?
justice
kennedy
was
there
a
finding
to
that
effect
here?
