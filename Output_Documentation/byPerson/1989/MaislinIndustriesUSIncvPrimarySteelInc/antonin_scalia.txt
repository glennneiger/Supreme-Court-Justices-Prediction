justice
scalia
mr.
auchincloss,
it...
it
used
to
be
true,
did
it
not,
that
even
if
the
rate
was
unreasonably
high
when
it
was
paid,
the
shipper
could
not
get
any
money
back,
if
he
paid
the
filed
rate?
justice
scalia
but
that
is
no
longer
true.
justice
scalia
and
that
was
true
at
the
time
we
decided
the
t.i.m.e.
case.
justice
scalia
but
they
now
do.
justice
scalia
so...
so
it
really
isn't
true
that...
anymore
at
least,
that
the
filed
rate
is
the
governing
rate.
what...
the
most
you
can
say
is
that
it
is
the
governing
rate
in
one
direction.
justice
scalia
but
in
light
of
that
change
in
the
act,
might
it
not
be
reasonable
to
reconsider
whether
our
decision
in
the
t.i.m.e.
case
should
come
out
the
same
way?
justice
scalia
suppose
we
hold,
as
you
wish
in
this
case,
that
the
shipper
has
to
pay
the
tariff
rate,
even
though
it
is
unreasonable.
so
the
shipper
goes
ahead
and
pays
it.
can
the
shipper
then
bring
a
suit
for
reparations
for
the
excessively
high
rate
that
he
has
been--
justice
scalia
--well,
no,
i'm
not
talking
hypothetically.
because
if
that
is
the
result
of
what
we
do
today,
that
you
just
require
two
suits,
initially,
since
the
carrier
cannot
raise
the
issue,
the
shipper
has
to
pay
the
money.
but
then,
of
course,
the
shipper
can
raise
the
issue,
so
he
can--
justice
scalia
--so
you
would
not
necessarily
say
that
we
would
come
out
the
way
you
want
us
to
come
out
if
this
were
a
case
in
which
it
was
an
unreasonable
rate?
you
would
not
be
making
the
same
arguments
you
are
making?
justice
scalia
mr.
auchincloss,
what
was
the
unreasonable
practice
found
by
the
commission
specifically?
was
it
the
charging
of
rates
below
the
tariff
rate,
or
was
it
the
quoting
of
rates
below
the
tariff
rate
and
then
the
attempt
to
collect
the
tariff
rate?
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
the
unreasonableness
is
not
trying
to
get
the
full
tariff
rate,
even
though
you
agreed
to
less.
the
unreasonableness
was
agreeing
to
less
in
the
first
place.
justice
scalia
doesn't
every
shipper
do
that?
i
mean,
is
that
a
special
finding
for
this
case?
i
assume
every
shipper
assumes
that
the
carrier
is
going
to
comply
with
the
law.
justice
scalia
if
that
alone
were
a
justification
for
departing
from
the
tariff,
from
the
filed
rate,
it
would
always
be
a
justification
for
a
departure.
justice
scalia
we
are
going
to
compel
you
to
continue
to
violate
it--
justice
scalia
--is
what
they
have
said
in
effect.
justice
scalia
but
in
answering
justice
o'connor,
you...
you...
you
spoke
as
though
the
only
obligation
of
the
carrier
is
to
file
the
tariff
rate.
it
is
not.
justice
scalia
it...
it
is
his
obligation
to
charge
the
tariff
rate.
justice
scalia
well,
then
let's
charge
and
collect
that.
and...
and
what
the
commission
said--
justice
scalia
--what
the
commission
said,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
is
that
complying
with
that
is
an
unreasonable
billing
practice.
justice
scalia
mr.
merrill,
can
i
ask
about
this,
what
the
unreasonable
practice
is
again?
as
i
understand
it,
it
would
not
have
been
an
unreasonable
practice
if
they
had
been
agreeing
to
the
lower
rate,
but
charging
the
higher
rate,
the
tariff
rate,
all
along.
justice
scalia
and
it
would
not
have
been
an
unreasonable
practice
if
they
had
been
agreeing
to
the
lower
rate,
and
charging
the
lower
rate
all
along,
and
then
continued
to
charge
the
lower
rate
the
last
time
around.
that
also
would
not
have
been
an
unreasonable
practice.
justice
scalia
you
said
it
was
essential
to
the
whole
thing
that
there
had
been
the
prior
practice
of
both
agreeing
to
and
actually
billing
the
lower
rate.
justice
scalia
so
the
unreasonable
practice,
then,
is
not
trying
to
collect
the
higher
rate,
it's
just
what?
justice
scalia
agreeing
to
the
lower
rate.
justice
scalia
but
that
is
not
a
billing
practice.
justice
scalia
--mr.
merrill,
could
i
ask
this.
you
said
earlier
that
there
are
hundreds
of
cases
involving
this
problem.
do
you
have
any
idea
what
percentage
of
those
hundreds
of
cases
involve
rates
that
are
reasonable
rates,
or
as
to
which
there
is
no
claim
that
the
rates...
that
the
tariffed
rates
were
unreasonable?
justice
scalia
well,
that
might
make
a
big
difference.
i
mean,
we're
not
talking
here
about
whether
the
commission
might
achieve
this
by
finding
the
rate
to
have
been
unreasonable.
justice
scalia
xxx
the
concept.
justice
scalia
they
don't
have
to.
it
doesn't
like
the
concept.
