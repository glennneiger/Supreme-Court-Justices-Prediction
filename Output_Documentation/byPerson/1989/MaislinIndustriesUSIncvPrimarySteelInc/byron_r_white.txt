justice

mr.
auchincloss,
suppose
the
railroad
or
the
trucker
had
filed
the
rates
like
he
said
he
would.
justice
white
it
would
have
applied
to
everybody,
wouldn't
it?
justice
white
not
just
this
one
transaction.
justice
white
but
if
they
are
held
to
be
unreasonable
in
such...
on
such
a
referral,
everybody
who
has
been
charged
that
rate
has
some
remedy.
is
that
it?
justice
white
yeah,
but
they
based
it
on
the
fact
that
they...
there
was
an
agreement.
justice
white
all
right,
there
was
an
agreement,
and
the
shipper
paid
the
lower
rate
relying
on
it.
and
the
carrier
failed
to
file
a
new
tariff.
justice
white
and
they
say
that
that
is
an
unreasonable
practice
then.
that's
what
they
say.
justice
white
but
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
white
what
did
they...
what
did
the
commission
call
it?
justice
white
well,
but
i
would
think
they...
what...
the
issue
is
whether
they
could
collect
the
tariff.
justice
white
i
mean
collect
what
they
should
have.
justice
white
well,
attempting
to
try
to
collect
what
they
hadn't
agreed
to,
what...
again,
what
is
the
unreasonable
practice?
trying
to
collect
something
they
had
agreed
not
to,
or
what?
justice
white
well,
what
does
the
commission
suggest
would
keep
whatever
suggests
to
the
carrier
that
it
adhere
to
its
tariffs?
justice
white
so
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the...
i
guess
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
to
the
commission
whether
the...
whether
the
carrier
had
ever
intended
to
live
up
to
its
tariff
or
not.
all
it
had
to
do
was
to
quote
a
lower
rate
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
justice
white
i
take
it
that...
that
in
the
commission's
view,
departing
from
the
tariff
would...
could
never...
could
never
result
in
any
kind
of
a
penalty
of
any
kind?
justice
white
did
you
say
that
departing
from
the
filed
rate
is
a...
could
be
a
crime?
justice
white
in
a
civil
penalty?
justice
white
well,
it
can't
be...
it
can't
be...
i
guess
saying
it's
an
unreasonable
practice
doesn't...
wouldn't
prevent
the
imposition
of
a
penalty
from
departing
from
the
tariff.
justice
white
i
suppose
the
commission
could
say
well,
you
have
been
unreasonable,
and
you
not
only
can't
collect
this
difference
between
the
tariff
and
what
you
charged,
but
we
are
also
going
to
penalize
you
for
departing
from
the
tariff.
justice
white
but
you
don't
think
that's
much...
these
days,
much
of
a
incentive
to
comply
with
the
tariff?
justice
white
even
though
the
undercharging
may
have
put
it
into
bankruptcy.
justice
white
i
would
think
creditors.
i
think
creditors
have
some
stake
in
this,
don't
they?
justice
white
well,
they...
i
would
suppose,
if...
if...
if
the...
if
the
carrier
had
an
obligation
to
collect
a
rate
that
it
didn't
collect,
that
it...
somebody
owes
it
something.
justice
white
and
the
creditors
ought
to
insist
that
the
trustee
bring
a
lawsuit,
which
he
did.
justice
white
i
know,
but
we
judge
this
case
as
though
the
rate
was
reasonable.
justice
white
xxx
reason
to
depart
from
the
tariff.
justice
white
i
suppose
the
commission's
approach
would
cover
the
situation
where
the...
where
the
shipper
wants
a
lower
rate
and...
than
he
knows
in
the
carrier's
tariff.
and
the
carrier
says
well,
you're
a
great
customer,
okay,
you're
going
to
get
the
lower
rate,
but
please
don't
tell
anybody.
and
he
goes
ahead
and
charges
it
for
two
or
three
years,
and
then
he
goes
bankrupt.
justice
white
well,
why
not?
justice
white
so
the...
the
shipper
has
to
be
innocent,
is
that
it?
justice
white
--is
it
common
practice
not
to
adhere
to
the
filed
tariffs?
justice
white
well,
what
did
you
just
say?
justice
white
yes,
but
this
is
a
tariff
rate.
justice
white
well,
then...
then
it
is
common
practice
not
to...
common
practice
to
agree
to
charge
a
rate
that
is
not
on
file
with
the
commission.
justice
white
well,
there
was
no
such
understanding
in
this
case.
and
you
say
that
it's
irrelevant
to...
to
this
case.
justice
white
well,
and
you
say
it
is
irrelevant
whether
there
was
or
not.
justice
white
all
shippers
do.
i
mean,
all
shippers
do.
i...
anybody
i
deal
with,
i
assume
that
they
are
going
to
comply
with
the
law.
can't
you
always
say
that,
unless
there
is
some
indication
where
they
specifically
agree
now,
i
am
telling
you
i
am
not
going
to
file
this
rate,
i
suppose.
but
normally,
if
they
say
nothing
about
it,
the
commission
would
say
the
same
thing
it
did
here,
wouldn't
it?
that
the--
justice
white
do
you
know
of
any
instance
where
the
commission
has
gotten
after
some
carrier
for
negotiating
a
rate
lower
than
the
tariff
rate,
and
in
short
just
plain
violate
the
statute?
justice
white
because
if
you
say
this
is
this...
this
practice
is
just
common
everyday
occurrence
around,
and
the
commission
isn't
doing
anything
about
it,
it
sounds
like
the
whole
business
of
requiring
carriers
to
comply
with
the
statutory
requirement
of
charging
the
same
to
everybody
is
just
hash.
justice
white
how
are
they
doing
that?
justice
white
it's
like
estoppel?
justice
white
exactly.
