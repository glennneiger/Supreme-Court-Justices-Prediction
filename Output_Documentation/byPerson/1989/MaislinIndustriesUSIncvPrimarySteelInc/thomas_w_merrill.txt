mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
and
legal
issues
presented
by
this
case
are
typical
of
hundreds
of
proceedings
which
are
now
pending
in
the
lower
courts
involving
insolvent
motor
carriers.
these
cases
share
a...
common
pattern
or
sequence
of
events,
which
consists
of
the
following.
first,
a
shipper
negotiates
a
rate
with
a
motor
carrier,
an
event
which
happens
hundreds
and
even
thousands
of
times
today...
every
day,
under
the
competitive
regime
established
by
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1980.
second,
the
carrier
fails
to
file
that
rate
in
a
tariff,
as
it
is
required
to
do
by
the
interstate
commerce
act.
third...
and
as
the
shipper
relies
on
the
carrier
to
do.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
there
was
no
evidence
of
an
agreement,
but
there...
the
commission
specifically
found
that
primary,
the
shipper,
relied
on
quinn,
the
carrier,
to
implement
the
proper...
implement
properly
the
quoted
rates.
that's
at
page
43a
of
the
petitioners'--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--the
commission's
finding
was
that
the
shipper
relied
on
the
carrier
to
do
everything
that
the
law
requires
to
properly
implement
the
negotiated
rate,
yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
it
probably
is
true
that
most
every
shipper
assumes
that
the
carrier
will
comply
with
the
law.
i
think--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--what...
i
think
the
important
point
here
about
the
commission's
reliance
element
is
that
there
can
be
no
evidence
that
the
shipper
had
knowledge
that
the
carrier
in
fact
was
not
intending
to
file
the
rate
in
the
tariff.
that
type
of
evidence
would
suggest
that
the
shipper,
as
well
as
the
carrier,
was
in
violation
of
the
law,
and
particularly
had
violated
the
elkins
act.
but
there
is
no
requirement
in
the
statute
that
imposes
a
duty
on
the
shipper
to
make
inquiry
of
the
carrier
about
whether
it
is
complying
with
the
law.
and
so
the
commission
has
carefully
tailored
its
negotiated
rates
policy
to
conform
with
the
various
statutory
requirements.
and
that's
the
main
purpose
of
the
element
that
the
shipper
must
have
been
able
to
reasonably
rely
on
the
carrier
doing
whatever
the
law
requires
to
lawfully
implement
its
rate.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
justice
o'connor,
the
commission
did
not
reach
the
rate
reasonableness
issue.
it
said
nothing
about
it.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
don't
think
the
legal
analysis
should
turn
on
whether
the
rate
was
either
assumed
to
be
reasonable
or
assumed
to
be
unreasonable.
the
commission
found--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--yes.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
statute
does
require
that,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
yes,
there
are.
the
carrier
is
subject
to
potential
criminal
liability
for
knowingly
charging
a
rate
less
than
the
tariff
rate,
or
soliciting
a
rate
less
than
the
tariff
rate.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
think
what
the
commission
has
done
here
is
not--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--the
commission
is
not
forgiving
carriers
of
their
obligation
to
file
rates
and
tariffs.
the
commission
has
no
intention
of
doing
that
whatsoever,
and
it
has
stated
that
quite
explicitly
in
both
of
its
negotiated
rates
opinions.
what
the
commission
is
doing
here
is
finding
that
the
carrier
has
committed
an
unreasonable
practice
by,
among
other
things,
violating
its
statutory
duties.
the
petitioners
have
suggested,
or
tried
to
obscure
the
fact
of
who
is
really
at
fault
here,
suggesting
that
somehow
the
shipper
is
somehow
to
blame
for
this.
but
it's...
under
the
statute
it's
the
carrier
that
has
the
duty
to
file
its
agreed-upon
rates
and
tariffs.
it's
the
carrier
that
has
the
duty
to
charge
and
collect
the
tariff
rate,
which
it
did
not
do
for
years
here.
it
was
billing
the
shipper
at
the
negotiated
rate,
not
at
the
tariff
rate.
and
so
it
is
the
carrier
that
has
committed
statutory
violations.
and
what
the
commission
has
said
is
that
in
terms
of...
of
administratively
determining
the
appropriate
remedies
for
violations
of
those
sections
of
the
act
and
for
committing
unreasonable
practices--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--no,
we
are
going--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--we
are
going
to
declare
it
an
unreasonable
practice
for
the
carrier
to
obtain
a
windfall,
essentially,
based
on
its
own
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no,
there
is--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--it's...
it's
stated
in...
the
first
sentence
of
7061(a)
says
the
carrier
must
file,
and
7062(a)
says
the
same
thing,
and
then
the
second
section
of
section
7061(a)
says
the
carrier
must
only
charge
and
collect
the
rate
at
tariff.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
and
the
carrier
violated
that
provision.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no,
the
commission
has
not
said
that
simply
not
collecting
the
tariff
rate
is
an
unreasonable
billing
practice.
what
the
commission
has
said
is
that
when
these
four
elements
are
identified...
negotiation
of
the
rate;
reliance
by
the
shipper
on
the
carrier's
compliance
with
all
statutory
requirements;
nevertheless
the
carrier
goes
ahead
and
charges
and
collects
the
negotiated
rate,
not
the
tariff
rate,
over
a
long
period
of
time
typically;
and
finally,
many
years
later,
typically
when
the
carrier
is
bankrupt,
comes
back
and
attempts
to
collect
the
much
higher
tariff
rate...
that
that
course
of
conduct,
taken
together,
is
an
unreasonable
practice.
and
when
the
facts
are
found
by
the
commission
that
will
support
a
finding
that
there
is
an
unreasonable
practice,
the
commission
will
advise
the
courts
that
the
unreasonable
practice
should
preclude
the
carrier
from
collecting
its
full
tariff
charges.
and--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--it's
possible
that
the
carrier,
through
its
own
improvidence...
went
into
bankruptcy.
there
may
be
no--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--yes,
but
i
don't
think
there
is
any
conflict
between
the
bankruptcy
laws
and
the
commission's
negotiated
rates
policy.
the
commission's...
the
policy
doesn't
apply
just
to
bankrupt
carriers.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
that's
correct,
but
the
carrier
is--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--the
carrier
has
no
right
to
collect
a
tariff
rate
that
is
found
to
be
unreasonable.
the
petitioners
this
morning,
or
this
afternoon,
have
conceded
that
if
the
commission
enters
a
finding
that
the
rate
was
unreasonable,
the
commission's
find
even
unreasonableness
supersedes.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
and
similarly
the
commission
has
found
in
negotiated
rates
that
if
the
carrier
has
committed
an
unreasonable
practice,
which
is
defined
by
these
elements
that
i
have
summarized,
that
the
finding
of
an
unreasonable
practice
should
supersede
the
filed
tariff
rate
and
prevent
full
collection.
so,
essentially,
the
carrier
or
its
trustee
in
bankruptcy
is...
is
asserting
the
right
to
collect
an
unreasonable
charge,
and
there
is
no
right
that
creditors
of
the
bankrupt
have
to
obtain
the
benefit
of...
of
an
illegal
charge.
again,
let
me
stress
that
the,
the
statutory
violations
which
admittedly
have
occurred
here
are
duties
which
the
statute
imposes
on
the
carrier.
they
are
not
imposed
on
the
shipper.
the
carrier
is
essentially
before
this
court
seek...
seeking
to
obtain
a
windfall
produced
by
its
own
statutory
violations.
the
shipper
has
engaged
in
no
affirmative
misconduct
in
these
cases
whatsoever,
and
in
fact
typically
has
no
way
to
get
these
charges
back,
because
they
were
passed
on,
to
the
extent
that
they
were
passed
on
to
their...
the
shipper's
customers
years
ago,
and
those
transactions
have
long
since
been
closed.
the
only
real
difficulty
with
the
commission's...
the
only
two
legal
issues,
i
think,
that
need
to
be
resolved
in
order
to
rule...
to
uphold
the
commission's
policy
are
two.
petitioners
have
conceded
that
if
this
were
an
unreasonable
rates
case
that
the
commission's
order
finding
an
unreasonable
rate
would
supersede
the
tariff
rate.
so
one
issue
that
has
to
be
decided
is
whether
or
not
there
is
any
difference
under
the
statute
between
unreasonable
rates
and
unreasonable
practices,
whether
the
statute
draws
a
line
between
those
two
things,
such
that
a
finding
of
unreasonable
practices
does
not
supersede
a
tariff
filing,
whereas
a
finding
of
unreasonable
rates
would.
and
the
second
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
commission
has
primary
jurisdiction
to
consider
unreasonable
practice
claims
that
are
referred
to
it
by
the
courts.
and
i
think
the
answer
to
both
of
those
questions
is
that...
is
that
the
commission's
decision
is
fully
justified.
the
provision
that
carriers
must
engage
in
reasonable
practices
is
found
in
the
very
same
sections
of
the
statute
that
say
that
the
carrier
must
engage
in...
must
charge
reasonable
rates,
section
10701(a)
and
section
10704.
so
the
same
statutory
provisions
govern
both
cases.
in
addition,
this
court
has
held
on
many
occasions
that
when
a
claim
of
unreasonable
practices
is
raised
in
the
course
of
a
judicial
action,
that
that
claim
implicates
the
administrative
discretion
of
the
icc
and
must
be
referred
to
the
icc
for
determination.
it
can't
be
decided
by
courts.
so
in
terms
of
the
primary
jurisdiction
jurisprudence,
the
court
has
drawn
no
distinction
between
unreasonable
rates
and
unreasonable
practices.
and
for
those
reasons
we
think
that
the
petitioners'
suggestion
that
somehow,
merely
because
the
commission
is
relying
on
its
practices
jurisprudence
here
rather
than...
or
practices
authority
rather
than
its
rates
authority,
that
a
different
result
ought
to
maintain.
i
think
it
is
also
important
that
what
is
involved
here
is
the
commission's
essentially
attempting
to
reconcile
two
different
provisions
of
the
statute.
you
have
section
10761(a),
which
the
petitioners
rely
on,
which
requires
the
carrier
to
file
its
rates
and
tariffs
and
collect
only
the
tariff
rates,
but
you
also
have
the
duty
to
engage,
to
maintain
reasonable
practices.
commission...
the
petitioners'
theory
essentially
is
that
the
one
section,
the
tariff
filing
section,
completely...
completely
trumps
the
unreasonable
rates
practice,
because
neither
the
courts
nor
the
commission
would
have
any
authority
whatsoever
to
grant
relief
to
shippers
in
this
type
of
circumstance
presented
by
this
case.
they
would
be
no
way
that
they
could
obtain
any
type
of
damages
or
reparations
for
unreasonable
practices
that
are
in
fact
statutory
violations.
but
the
commission's
determination
here
has
essentially
attempted
to
accommodate
or
reconcile
these
two
statutory
provisions.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
think
that
is
correct.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
you
may
have
no
collection
action--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i
don't
think
the
attempt
to
collect
the
rates
adds
anything
to
the
unreasonableness.
it
simply
is
the
occasion
on
which
the
commission
becomes
aware
that
these
unreasonable
practices
has
been
going
on.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
it's
the--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--agreeing
to
the
lower
rate.
the
shipper's
reliance
on
the
carrier
to
conform
that
rate
to
the
law,
i.e.,
file
it
in
a
tariff.
and
finally--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--that's
a
solicitation
practice.
and
finally
the
carrier's
persisting
in
charging
and
collecting
the
negotiated
rate
as
opposed
to
the
tariff
rate.
these
are
cases
typically
that
have
gone
on
for
some...
some
period
of
time.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
the
failure
to
file
is
a
key
part,
yes.
i
mean,
the
statute
in
two
places--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i
have
already
mentioned
them,
10761(a)
and
10762,
imposes
on
the
carrier
the
duty
to
file
the
rates
for
its
transportation
services
in
tariffs.
and
the
carrier
has
violated
that
duty
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
the
commission's
not...
again,
i
mean,
the
petitioners
try
to
suggest
that
the
commission
has
repealed
the
filed
tariff
doctrine.
the
commission
has
no
intention
of
doing
that
whatsoever,
and
i...
the
commission...
for
example,
the
commission's
policy
doesn't
apply
to
cases
of
isolated
misquotation.
the
commission's
policy
only
applies
to
the
circumstances
identified
in
this
decision.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no.
a
misquotation
would
be
where
there
is
an
agreement
to
abide
by
the
tariff,
and
some
mistake
occurs.
that
is
like
in
the
facts
in
the
maxwell
case,
where
mr.
maxwell
basically
was
of
the
same
state
of
mind
as
the
railroad.
they
both
wanted
him
to
be
able
to
go,
wherever
it
was,
st.
louis
to
salt
lake
city
and
back
at
a
certain
rate,
and
the
railroad
just
got
the
wrong
line
on
the
tariff.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no,
the
commission's
policy
would
not
apply
in
a
case--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
because
the
statute,
section
11902
of
the
interstate
commerce
act,
which
is
part
of
the
elkins
act,
imposes
treble
damage
liability
on
shippers
for
knowingly
accepting
a
rebate
from
the
tariff
rate.
so
if
the...
the
commission,
i
think,
was
trying
to
navigate
around
that.
quite
clearly
the
commission
did
not
want
to
vindicate
shippers
who
have
engaged
in
what
is
a
clear
statutory
violation.
but
that's
the
only
point
in
the
statute
where--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--that
is
correct.
the
shipper
has...
the
shipper
may
not
have
knowledge
of
the
carrier's
derelictions
of
its
statutory
duty.
the
negotiated
rates
policy
only
applies
in
those
cases
where
the
shipper
is
innocent,
has
not
informed
itself
and
otherwise
has
no
notice--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--yes,
i
think
the
commission
again
found
that...
that
the...
i
can't
recall
the
precise
language
at
this
moment,
but
on
page
42a
and
43a
of
the
commission's
decision
in
this
case
there
is
discussion
of
the
states
of
mind
of
both
the
carrier
and
the
shipper.
and...
and
it's...
it's
clear
also
from
the
evidence
that
was
submitted
in
the
record
that
the
shipper...
the
shipper
was
not
vigilant
in
this
case.
the
shipper
did
not
hire
a
tariff
watching
agency
or
something
like
that
to
double
check
on
the
carrier
to
make
sure
it
was
not
breaching
its
statutory
obligations.
but
there
is
no
suggestion
in
the
evidence
that
the
shipper
had
actual
knowledge
or
notice
of
the...
of
the
carrier's
misdeeds.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
in
other
words
you
have--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--one
tariff,
and
one
shipper
negotiates,
the
other
one
doesn't?
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
see.
what
you
have
just
described
is
really
an
everyday
happening
in
the
motor
carrier
industry
today.
the
negotiation
of
rates--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--yes.
the
act
still
prohibits
discrimination.
there's
no
question
about
that.
and...
discrimination,
however,
has...
is
defined
more
narrowly
today
than
it
was
back
in
the
heyday
of
the
filed
rate
doctrine
and
the
court's
early
decisions.
a
shipper
has
to
show
competitive
injury
in
order
to
establish
discrimination,
and
the
carrier
can
defeat
a
claim
of
discrimination
by
showing
that
there
is
some
relevant
difference
in
the
transportation
characteristics
of
the
two
movements,
like
the
costs
are
different,
for
example.
but
if
those
elements
are
satisfied,
if
a
shipper
can
show
competitive
injury,
that
there
is
a
disparity
in
rates,
that
the
same
carrier
controlled
both
rates,
and
the
carrier
can't
show
a
difference
in
costs
or
other
relevant
transportation
characteristics,
yes,
discrimination
is
a
possibility.
but
what
is
really
going
on
in
the
motor
carrier
industry,
and
the
commission's
decision
reflects
this,
is
that
at
least
when
you
are
dealing
with
something
like
we
are
in
this
case,
which
is
a
full
truckload
shipment
of
a
particular
commodity,
steel
in
this
case,
which
is
carried
on
flatbed
trucks,
that
it
is
common
throughout
the
industry
for...
for
carriers
to
call
up
shippers
and
to
dicker
over
rates,
and
for
the
parties
to
reach
an
agreement
about
a
particular
rate
that
will
apply.
and
this
is
true
for
companies
like
primary;
it
is
true
for
primary's
competitors.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
no,
no.
we
don't
think
it's
a
common
practice
not
to--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--it's
a
common
practice
to
negotiate
a
rate,
with
the
expectation--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--with
the
expectation
that
the
negotiated
rate
will
then
be
filed
in
the
tariff.
that
is
correct.
now,
these
are
what
are
called
commodity
rates.
you
have
to
remember--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--no.
there
is
an
agreement
on
a
rate,
with
the
understanding
that
then,
before
the
movement
occurs--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--there
was
no
specific
proof
of
an
agreement
to
file
a
tariff
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
the
commission's
policy
is
that
what
is
relevant
is
whether
or
not
the
shipper
relied
on
the
carrier
to
do
what
was
necessary
to
comply
with
its...
the
law,
which
includes
filing
the
tariff
rate.
but
there
was
no
specific--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--i
think...
i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
that
people
who
do
business
normally
assume
that
the
people
they
are
doing
business
with
will
comply
with
the
law.
they
think
that
they
are
not
conspiring
to
violate
the
antitrust
laws,
that
they
are
paying
their
taxes
and
so
forth.
and
essentially,
under
the
commission's
policy,
unless
there
is
some
indication
that
the
shipper
is
conniving
with
the
carrier
to
discriminate
against
its
competitors
by
getting
some
off
tariff
rate,
and
there
is
no
expectation
by
either
party
that
it
is
going
to
be
filed,
the
policy
will
apply.
but
you'd
have
to
say...
if
there
is
some
showing
of
that,
then
the
policy
does
not
apply.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
i
have
no
idea,
justice
scalia.
i
think
the
typical--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--the
commission
has
not
entertained
very
many
cases
on
the
merits
since
1980
alleging
unreasonable
motor
carrier
rates.
they
have
been
quite
scarce.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
what?
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
the
shippers
don't
like
the
concept
either,
because
the
shippers
can
go
out
and
get
different
quotations
and
tariff
rates
from
different
carriers.
i
mean,
competition
in
the
marketplace
has
really
eliminated
a
lot
of
the
need
for
supervision
of
unreasonable
rates
and
discriminatory
rates,
which
is
what
congress
basically
had
in
mind
when
it
passed
the
1980
act.
let
me...
let
me
specifically
make
mention
of
the
court's
case
law
which
is
relied
on
here,
and
in
particular
the
so-called
filed
rate
doctrine,
and
point
out
first
of
all
that
the
filed
rate
doctrine
is
not
a
term
which
appears
in
the
statute.
nor
is
it
a
term,
as
far
as
i
am
aware,
which
appears
in
any
of
this
court's
cases
construing
the
interstate
commerce
act.
that
term
can
be
found
in
some
gas
cases,
but
does
not
appear
in
the
court's
decisions
under
the
interstate
commerce
act.
and
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
court
act
with
some
precision
in
defining
exactly
what
is
meant
by
that
term
in
deciding
this
particular
case.
the
older
cases
that
are
cited,
maxwell,
fink,
mug
and
so
forth,
are
all
cases
that
were
adjudicated
in
court.
there
was
no
reference
to
the
icc.
the
icc
was
not
a
party
in
those
cases.
and
basically
the
holdings
of
those
cases
are
that
a
court
is
not
permitted
to
deviate
from
the
filed
tariff
rate
and
inquire
whether
the
rate
is
reasonable
or
whether
equitable
circumstances
might
create
a
valid
defense
to
collection
of
the
tariff
rate.
but
the
same
time
that
those
cases
make
that...
state
that
rather
inflexible
rule,
the
cases
also
recognize
that
the
rule
does
not
apply
to
the
interstate
commerce
commission.
maxwell
itself
says
that
the
rule...
the
strict
rule
applies
unless
the
commission
finds
that
the
rate
is
unreasonable.
and
there
are--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--the
commission,
i
don't
know
the
names
of
the
cases,
but
i
asked
and
i
was
told
that
the
commission
has
had
enforcement
proceedings
within
the
recent...
1988
and
1989,
against
carriers--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--well,
i
don't
think
it's
that
bad,
justice
white.
the
commission...
the
commission
does
not
want
to...
the
commission
wants
to
encourage
carriers
to
file
these
rates
and
tariffs.
i
mean,
the
commission
has
nothing
against
the
tariff
filing
requirement.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
well,
one
way...
well,
first
of
all,
this
proceeding
is
largely
retrospective
in
orientation.
the
commission
was
confronted
with
a
problem.
the
problem
was
this
avalanche
of
lawsuits
filed
in
bankruptcy
proceedings
with
carriers
seeking
to
recover
much...
much
higher
rates
than
had
been
agreed
to
with
shippers.
and
the
commission
basically
in
these
proceedings,
these
negotiated
rates
proceedings,
is
trying
to
figure
out
what
is
the
best
thing
to
do
about
that
problem.
and
i
think
by
telling
the
carrier
that
you
can't
gain
a
windfall,
you
can't
somehow,
after
the
fact
obtain
a
huge
increase
in
the
rate
that
the
shipper
never
agreed
to,
in
fact
helps
to
serve
to
dissuade
carriers
from
engaging
in
this
unreasonable
practice.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
tension
or
inconsistency
between
a
deterrence-type
rationale
and
what
the
commission
is
doing
in
this
particular
case.
the
commission
has
not
gone
by
special
proceeding
beyond
this
to
focus
on
whether
or
not
some
other
measures
might
be
appropriate
to
try
and
encourage
carriers
to
tow
the
line.
but
at
least
insofar
as
what
they
have
done
here,
i
don't
see
any...
any
inconsistency
between
what
they
have
done
and
those
larger
objectives.
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
it's...
i
hate
to
use
that
word,
because
these
old
cases
from
this
court
say
that
no
estoppel
is
permitted--
mr.
thomas
w.
merrill
--but
it's
a
commission--
[laughter]
it's
a
commission
finding
of
an
unreasonable
practice
which
supersedes
the
filed
rate
requirement.
let
me
briefly
mention
the
second
legal
issue.
i
have
said
the
first
legal
issue
really
was
whether
or
not
the...
a
different
rule
should
apply
for
unreasonable
practices
and
unreasonable
rates,
and
turn
briefly
to
the
primary
jurisdiction
issue,
since
it
is
featured
in
the
petitioners'
briefs
and
is
an
argument
that
can
generate
some
confusion.
the
question
here
is
whether,
although,
of
course,
the
commission
has
primary
jurisdiction
to
consider
an
unreasonable
rate
referral
from
the
court,
it
has
no
primary
jurisdiction
to
consider
an
unreasonable
practices
referral.
and
i
don't...
we
don't
think
that
there
is
any
basis
for
this
either
in
the
t.i.m.e.
decision
or
anywhere
else.
essentially
the
argument
is
that
the
unreasonable
practice
involved
here
falls
into
a
crack
in
the
law.
the
petitioners
admit
that
is
this
were
an
unreasonable
rate
claim
it
would
be
expressly
governed
by
the
statute
that
congress
passed
to
overrule
the
t.i.m.e.
decision.
and
they
admit
that
if
this
were
an
unreasonable
practice
of
the
sort
that
was
involved
in
the
hewitt-robins
case,
which
was
decided
three
years
after
t.i.m.e.,
it
would
also
be
subject
to
the
commission's
primary
jurisdiction.
but
they
say
that
this
case
falls
into
a
crack
between
those
two
broad
areas
of
the
law,
and
therefore
is
not
subject
to
primary
jurisdiction.
the...
the
key
assumption
that
they
are
making
is
that
the
rationale
of
the
t.i.m.e.
decision
lives
on,
even
though
t.i.m.e.
was
overturned
by
congress.
and
that
under
the
rationale
of
the
t.i.m.e.
decision
there
would
be
no
basis
to
refer
this
issue
to
the
commission,
because
the
rationale
of
the
t.i.m.e.
decision
was
that
the
commission
can't
accept
a
case
on
referral
where
it
doesn't
have
independent
jurisdiction
to
grant
relief
on
its
own.
and
the
short
answer
to
that
is
that
that
particular
rationale
was
expressly
repudiated
by
this
court
in
the
hewitt-robins
case,
which
was
decided
three
years
after
t.i.m.e.
at
page
89
of
hewitt-robins
the
court
said
this,
and
i
quote,
"the
practice
of
the
commission
in
making
such
determination
in
the
first
place,
even
though
it
has
no
power
to
award
reparations
in
a
given
case,
has
long
been
exercised
and
is
supported
by
a
long
line
of
cases.
"
in
short,
this
court
itself
repudiated
the
rationale
that
the
petitioners
are
relying
upon
shortly
after
the
t.i.m.e....
case
came
down.
and
for
that
reason
alone,
commissioner's
argument
has
no
merit
and
should
be
rejected.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
