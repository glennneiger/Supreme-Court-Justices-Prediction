justice
o'connor
so
do
we
take
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
rate
was
reasonable,
but
that
the
decision
just
rests
on
whether
it
was
an
unreasonable
billing
practice?
justice
o'connor
that's
how
we
take
the
case.
justice
o'connor
but
you
do
concede
that
had
the
challenge
been
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
rate
and
had
that
been
sustained,
then
that
is
a
valid
defense?
justice
o'connor
mr.
merrill,
do
we
take
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
tariff
rate
was
a
reasonable
rate?
justice
o'connor
in
our
addressing
the
legal
issue,
do
we
need
to
assume
that
it
was
a
reasonable
rate?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
am
answering
my
question,
then.
i
want
you
to
assume
it
was
a
reasonable
rate.
justice
o'connor
and
then
tell
me
whether
the
statute
1070...
10761(a)
requires
the
carrier
to
collect
the
filed
tariff.
justice
o'connor
and
are
there
criminal
penalties
and
civil
penalties
potentially
for
not
doing
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
then
how
can
the
commission
say,
under
those
circumstances,
that
not
collecting
the
tariff
is
an
unreasonable
billing
practice?
justice
o'connor
it
just...
it
seems
very
hard
to
understand.
