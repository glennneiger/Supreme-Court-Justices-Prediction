justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
facts
of
the
case?
this
is...
the
cargo
that
was
carried
here
was
steel.
justice
stevens
did
the...
this
particular
carry...
carrier
carry
steel
for
other
shippers?
justice
stevens
and
at
what
rate
were
the
other
shippers
charged?
justice
stevens
well,
if
it's
not
in
the
record
then
you
really
can't
answer.
justice
stevens
was
it
holding
out
other
than
the
fact
that
it
had
a
filed
tariff?
justice
stevens
so
that
we
really
don't
know
what
rate
they
charged
others.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
they
didn't
all
ship
steel.
justice
stevens
but
there
were
others
that
shipped
steel?
justice
stevens
you're
sure
there
were?
does
the
record
tell
us?
justice
stevens
because
if
there
weren't
there
wouldn't
be
really
the
danger
of
discrimination
that
is...
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
filed
rate
doctrine.
justice
stevens
so
there
is
no
evidence
to
show
that
the
departure
from
the
filed
rate
was
discriminatory.
justice
stevens
part
of
the
element
is
the
failure
to
file,
is
part
of
the
unreasonableness.
justice
stevens
you
didn't
mention
it.
justice
stevens
mr.
merrill,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
commission's
policy?
it
is
not
directly
involved
in
this
case,
but
if
there
were
negotiated
rates,
two
different
negotiated
rates
for
competing
types
of
shipments
that
should
normally
be
covered
by
the
filed
tariff,
but
they
were
not
the
same,
would
the
policy
apply?
justice
stevens
you
have
discrimination
between
negotiated
rates.
justice
stevens
no,
no,
no.
the
one
carrier
negotiates
with
two
different
shippers,
and
tells
them
both
that
he
will
file
the
negotiated
rate.
but
the
two
shippers
get
different
negotiated
rates.
justice
stevens
see,
that
triggers
a
concern
that
isn't
necessarily
shown
by
the
record
of
this
case,
the
possibility
of
discrimination,
which
has
always
been
something
that--
