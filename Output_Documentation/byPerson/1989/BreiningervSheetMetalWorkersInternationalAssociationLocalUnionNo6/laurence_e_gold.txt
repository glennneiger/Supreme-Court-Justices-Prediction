mr.
laurence
e.
gold
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
wish
to
proceed
undaunted
by
justice
scalia's
statement
to
talk
about
the
duty
of
fair
representation
claim
and
to
seek
to
convince
the
court
that
that
claim,
as
the
lower
courts
have
stated,
is...
is
badly
founded.
i
think
that
it
is
most
helpful
to
begin
by
noting
what
congress
has
done
with
regard
to
hiring
halls.
this
is
not
a
subject
as
to...
which
has
escaped
legislative
attention.
and
no
matter
how
this
case
comes
out,
and
no
matter
what
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
determined
to
encompass,
individuals
like
mr.
breininger
who
claim,
at
least
in
the
second
breath,
that
they
have
been
harmed
in
job
opportunities,
either
because
they
are
non-members
or
because
they
are
8(b)(2)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
that's
no
mere
happenstance.
the
most
contentious
issue,
in
1947
when
congress
was
considering
a
question
of
how
unions
which
are
parties
to
collective
bargaining
relationships
should
be
regulated,
was
the
subject
of
the
closed
shop,
the
requirement
that
to
be
hired
you
had
to
be
a
union
member,
and
most
particularly,
the
closed
shop
in
connection
with
the
hiring
hall.
that
debate
was
of
the
dimension
of
the
debate
we
are
having
today
over
the
scope
of
the
capital
gains
tax.
it
was
an
issue
that
was
fought
out
in
public
and
not
in
private,
that
gripped
the
national
attention,
that
caused
rallies,
vetoes
and
the
like.
and
congress
came
to
a
conclusion
on...
on
that
issue.
and
the
conclusion
was
that
where
unions
have
an
active
role
in
the
hiring
process
they
should
be
subject
to
the
same
norms
as
employers,
same
nlra
norms
as
employers
who
are
engaged
in
the
hiring
process.
and
as
the
language
of
section
8(b)(2)
makes
plain,
that
is
the
gravamen
of
the
8(b)(2)
offense,
and
congress
was
operating
against
the
background
of
well
settled
law
that
an
employer
in
making
a
hiring
decision
violated
the
nlra
if
and
only
if
he
acted
on
the
basis
of
the
union
considerations.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
essence
of
the
matter
in
terms
of
what
the
statute
tells
us
in
terms
is
the
following.
that
if
an
employer
and
a
union
bargain
in
a
way
which
ends
up
in
the
employer
doing
the
hiring,
under
the
nlra
there
is
a
violation
if
and
only
if
the
employer
refuses
hire
on
the
basis
of
union
considerations.
and
if
the
employer
and
the
union
bargain
in
a
way
which
provides
that
an
outside
agency,
a
third
party,
an
employment
agency,
makes
the
hiring
decision,
the
same
rule
obtains.
the
argument
here
is
that
if
the
employer
and
the
union
bargain
and
the
determination
is
made
that
the
union
will
have
an
active
role
in
the
hiring
process,
there
is
a
different
standard,
as
justice
stevens
indicated,
that
the
standard
would
be
the
one
drawn
from
the
duty
of
fair
representation
and
would
be...
would
stretch
beyond
alleged
wrongs
based
on
union
consideration
to
claims
that
the
union
didn't
have
specific...
sufficiently
specific
rules,
which
would
not
be
a
violation
for
the
employer,
that
the
union
had
rules
which
it
didn't
follow,
to
the
detriment
of
people
who
were
union
members
and
were
close
to
the
administration,
and
so
on.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no.
we
are
arguing
that
that
would
allege
a
good
unfair
labor
practice
claim.
and
the
question
here
is
whether
that
kind
of
unfair
labor
practice
claim,
which
under
normal
rules
would
go
only
to
the
national
labor
relations
board,
also
states
a
good
claim
of
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
to
go
back
to
what
i
said
about
the
employer.
if
an
individual
walks
into
court
and
says
the
employer
is...
refused
to
hire
me
because
i
am
a
union
member,
and
he
has
the
facts
to
demonstrate
that,
he
cannot
go
to
court.
he
must
go
to
the
labor
board.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
the
labor
board
would
properly
find
that
an
unfair
labor
practice
had
been
committed,
and
give
the
individual
the
remedy.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
no,
i
apologize.
i
thought
you
were
still
talking
about
your
hypothetical.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
correct.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
right.
that
is
our
argument
in...
in
a
nutshell.
that
whoever
is
making
the
active
hiring
decision
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
subject
to
a
unitary
regime,
a
unitary
standard
and
a
unitary
procedure.
now,
this
is
in
no
way
to
deny
that
there
is
also
a
duty
of
fair
representation
which
applies
in
at
least
two
other
situations,
neither
of
which
congress
focused
on
in
1947
in
the
same
way
it
focused
on
the
party
with
the
act
of
hiring
role.
in
one
situation,
as
mr.
shapiro
stated,
when
a
union
negotiates
with
the
employer
on
the...
for
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it
is
bound
by
a
duty
of
fair
representation
under
this
court's
decision.
that's
an
implied
claim
and
an
implied
judicial
cause
of
action
which
has
been
created
out
of
the
act.
obviously,
that
is
not
a
situation
in
which
the
union
is
standing
in
the
same
position
as
the
employer,
in
the
same
way
as
we
have
where
the
union
is
taking
an
active
role
in
the
hiring
process
and
has,
in...
in
essence,
supplanted
the
employer.
it
is
acting
on
behalf
of
the
individuals
to
set
rules
that
the
employer
will
follow.
and
it
is
also
settled
that
where
the
union
is
the
party
which
administers
a
grievance
and
arbitration
system
vis
a
vis
the
employer,
that
the
union
is
bound
by
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
and
that
duty,
for
intensely
practical
reasons
and
other
reasons,
as
the
court
said
in
vaca,
is
subject
to
suit
in
court.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yup.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that's
correct.
it
would
constitute
a
blatant
violation
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
which,
at
the
labor
movements
behest,
covers
not
only
employer
discrimination
but
union
discrimination.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
and
the
point
that
is
inherent
in
your
question
is
one
that
we
have
to
face
up
to,
because
we
are
saying
that
in
that
situation
there
would
be
no
nlra-based
claim,
even
though
in
other
situations,
the
two
i've
mentioned,
in
negotiating
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
in
administering
grievance
and
arbitration
systems,
the
union
would
be
subject
to
both
an
nlra
claim
and
a
title
vii
claim.
and--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--in
the
situation
that
justice
stevens--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--hypothesized.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
because
section
8(b)(2)
covers
situations
in
which
the
union
causes
or
attempts
to
cause
a
violation
of
section
8(a)(3).
section
8(a)(3)
prohibits
discrimination
which
encourages
or
discourages
union
membership,
and
this
court,
in
a
series
of
cases,
has
said
that
you
have
to
show
that
there
was
a
union
consideration
that
is
on
the
base.
the
easy
way
of
looking
at
it
is
if
an
employer
said
i
will
only
hire
white
people,
would
he
be
subject
to
an
8(a)(3)
claim.
the
answer
is
no.
he
would
be
subject
to
a
title
vii
claim.
and
we
are
saying
that
in
this
one
situation
where
the
party
that
bargained
things
out
and
the
employer
said
you
will
stand
in
my
shoes
in
the
hiring
decision,
that
congress
decided
that
the
rules
would
be
the
same.
now,
in
other
situations
where
the
union
is
not
standing
in
the
employer's
shoes,
is
not
taking
the
employer's
active
role
in
making
hiring
decisions,
we
can't
make
this
equation
between
what
employers
can
do
under
8(a)(3)
and
what
unions
can
do
as
exclusive
representatives.
in
that
situation,
in
those
situations,
in
part
for
a
reason
that
mr.
shapiro
gave
and
which
comes
from
vaca,
because
the
union
stands
in
the
way
of
the
employee
acting
against
the...
vindicating
legal
rights
against
the
employer,
the
union
is
bound
by
a
duty
of
fair
representation.
there
is
no
analogy
to
what
the
employer
does.
the
union
stands
between
the
employee
with
a
grievance
about
what
the
employer
is
doing
and
his...
and
the
employer.
and
therefore,
there
is
a
duty
of
fair
representation.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
that's...
yeah,
i
mean,
it
is
the...
it
is
the
union,
it
would
be...
it
is
certainly
possible,
but
it
would
be
paradoxical
for
congress
to
say
that,
whereas
in
1946
the
individual
had
no
right
against
the
employer
for
his
direct
action
in
refusing
to
hire,
if
the
employer
and
the
union
reach
an
agreement
which...
which
says
the
union
will
act
for
me
from
now
on,
there
ought
to
be
a
new
norm.
nothing
has
been
taken
away
from
the
employee
in
that
situation.
after
all,
where
the
union
is
bargaining
with
the
employer
over
what
the...
the
contract
terms
will
be,
it
can
be
said,
as
vaca
says,
that
the
employees
have
lost
something.
where
the
union
is
dealing
with
a
grievance
and
the
individual
says
i
have
a
contract
right
vis
a
vis
the
employer,
and
the
union
is
the
only
means
through
which
i
can
vindicate
that,
through
the
grievance
arbitration
system,
and
the
union
acts
arbitrarily,
in
those
situations
you
have
the
union
acting
in
a
representative
capacity
in
a
way
which
can
be
said
to
disadvantage
the
individual
in
his
ability
to
vindicate
his
legal
rights.
but
here--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--to
say
that
the
union
has
a
trust
relationship--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
but
it's
the
job...
it
indicates
the
nature
of
the
job
we're
about
here.
the...
what
is
inherent
in
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
should
be
vindicated
by
this
implied
cause
of
action.
i...
i
think
we...
we
ought
to
be
quite
frank
about
the
parameters
of
the
debate.
you
can
read
the
whole
national
labor
relations
act
and
you'll
never
find
a
duty
of
fair
representation.
you
can
read
the
whole
act
and
you're
never
going
to
find
a
basis
for
1337
judicial
jurisdiction.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
well--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--the
question
is,
and
i
admit
to
making
this
one
of
my
subspecialties,
whether
we
continue
to
lose
out
to
infinity,
it...
it...
it
seems
to
us
that,
as
chief
justice
burger
said
in
united
states
v.
12
200-foot
reels
of
tape,
one
of
my
favorite
decisions,
that
the
jested
of
possibilities
of
taking
one
step
at
a
time
shouldn't
be
pressed
beyond
where
reason
takes
you.
and
it
seems
to
us
that
in
determining
how
far
the
court
ought
to
go
in
defining
what's
within
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
that's
what...
that...
that's
what
the
discussion
is
about.
what
are...
what
is
the
scope
of...
of
this--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--oh,
this
union
was
certified
exclusive
representative--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--and
i
think
its
contracts--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--yeah,
certainly
one...
one
possibility
is
to
say
that
despite
whatever
lessons
we
can
grasp
from
the
particulars
of
1940...
of
what
happened
in
1947,
8(b)(2)
and
so
on,
that
anything
that
flows
out
of
union
exclusive
bargaining
relationships
should
be
covered
by
the
duty.
and
that
is,
in
essence,
the
position
for
which
the
united
states
argues
here.
our
counterargument
is
that
the
court,
in
implying
norms
and
in
implying
judicial
causes
of
action,
ought
to
draw
those
norms
and
causes
of
action
out
of
the
entirety
of
the
statutory
materials
which
form
the
base
of
the
implications.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
yes,
we're--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
it
would
sanction
the...
the
matter.
in
other
words,
we
believe
that
the
right
rule
concerning
8(a)(3)
and
8(b)(2)
is
the
rule
this
court
stated
in
local
357
teamsters.
and
that
is
they
have
to
show
union-based
discrimination.
the
board
is--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--well,
but
the
point
is
that
if
we're
right
about
the
unfair
labor
practice,
and
this
court
extends
the
duty
of
fair
representation
to
the
point
of
covering
arbitrary
action
which
would
not
be
an
employer
or
a
union
unfair
labor
practice,
then
congress
certainly
labored
in
vain,
and
the
implied
cause
of
action
goes
well
beyond
the
specifics
of
the
particular
determination
that
congress
made.
in
other
words--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--correct.
yes.
and,
there's
no
allegation
that
in...
in
count
1.
i...
i...
i
think
in
part
it's
a
recognition
that
there
are
some
problems
with
the
allegation
that
there
was
retaliation
for
union
activity
here,
but
in
part
it
was
that
the
complaint
would
look
like,
walk
like
and
smell
like
an
8(b)(2)
if
the
statement
was
that
the
union
should
incur
nlra
liability
in
a
judicial
forum
for
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
union
conduct.
'cause
at
that
point,
all
you
would
have
to
do
is
look
at
8(b)(2),
look
at
its
legislative
history
and
know
that
congress
specifically
determined
that
that
kind
of
claim
on
a
particular
standard
ought
to
go
to
the
labor
board.
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
what
is
water
over
the
dam,
as
far
as
we
are
concerned,
is
that
there
is
a
duty
of
fair
representation.
and
that
it
applies
in
situations
in
which
the
union
is
acting
in
a
way
that
no
employer
does.
but
there
is
no
case,
and
therefore
no
water
and
no
dam,
that
states
what
the
limit
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is.
and
we're
arguing
that
this
ought
to
be
a
limit,
that
when
you
look
at
the
whole
statute
which
you
are
elaborating
through
a
process
of
implication,
that
it
is
a
mistake
to...
to
define
the
duty
of
fair
representation
so
broadly
that
it
duplicates
the
particular
coverage
that
congress
intended
with
regard
to
the
regulation
of
hiring
decisions
under
the
nlra,
and
indeed
overpowers
the
rule
that
congress,
after
the
most
contentious
debate,
arrived
at
with
regard
to
when
a
hiring
decision
is
a
violation
of
title
vii
as
opposed
to...
i
mean,
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
opposed
to
a
violation
of
some
other
claim.
what
is
at
issue
here
is
both
the
proper
tribunal
for
determining
the
validity
of
nlra
hiring
decisions,
which,
overwhelmingly
before
this
late-blooming
theory,
have
been
handled
by
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--i
wanted
to,
glancing
up
at
the
clock,
turn
to
that.
we
are
equally
concerned,
but
we
just
feel
much
better
armored
against
the
landrum-griffin
claim
here
because
of
the
nature
of
the
claim
that
was
actually
made,
the
nature
of
the
question
that--
mr.
laurence
e.
gold
--no.
the
complaint...
let
me
just
say
something
very
quickly
about
the
structure
of
the
landrum-griffin
act.
the
landrum-griffin
act
has
a
provision,
section
101(a)(2),
which
safeguards
member
free
speech.
it
has
another
provision
in
section
101(a)(5)
which
prevents
discipline
without
due
process,
or
the
imposition
of
union
penalties
without
due
process,
hearing
and
so
on.
section
102
gives
individuals
a
cause
of
action
for
a
breach
of
either
101(a)(2),
the
free
speech
provision,
or
101(a)(5),
and
section
609,
as
this
court
said
in
finnegan
v.
leu,
which
has
been
referred
to
here,
in
essence
replicates,
and
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
is
parallel
to
section
102.
the
only
claim
made
in
the
complaint,
the
only
question
raised
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
concerns
section
101(a)(5),
the
due
process
provision,
and
section
609.
there
is
no
reference
to
section
101(a)(2).
it
was
never
raised;
it's
not
here.
and
this
court
quite
clearly
held,
in
finnegan
v.
leu,
that
retaliatory
actions
that
affect
a
union
members
rights
or
status
as
a
member
of
the
union
are
all
that
is
covered
by
section
101(a)(5)
and
section
609.
so
we
think
the
lower
court
was
plainly
correct
on
this
court's
precedence
with
regard
to
the
landrum-griffin
claim.
to
say
that
a
job
referral
out
of
a
non
exclusive
hiring
hall
is
an
incident
of
membership,
when
the
union
can't
limit
the
use
of
the
hiring
hall
only
to
members,
and
doesn't
purport
to,
is
no
more
sensible
than
to
say
that
discharge
from
a
union
position,
an
appointed
union
position,
is
discipline.
and
the
court
squarely,
of
course,
has
rejected
the
latter
of
those
two
propositions.
i
want
to
say
something,
too,
about
the
practicalities
of
this.
what
really
is
affected
here
is
whether
you
have
to
go
through
a
due
process
system
in
administering
a
hiring
hall.
the
theory
of
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
that
any
union
decision,
a
is
referred
rather
than
b,
is
a
form
of
discipline
to
b.
and
therefore,
that
you
have
to
serve
a
charge
on
b
for
not
having
worked
as
long
as
a,
or
for
any
other
claim.
i
want
to
make
it
plain
that
nothing
we
ask
this
court
to
say
or
do
implicates
the
question
of
whether
somebody
who
pleads
101(a)(2)
states
and
says
that
one
of
the
ways
that
the
union
retaliated
against
him
for
exercising
free
speech
is
job
related,
doesn't
have
a
good
claim...
cause
of
action.
that
is
just
not
here.
that's
a
question
for
the
future.
it
was
never
pled;
it
was
never
litigated.
so,
in
sum,
we
say
that
insofar
as
the
petitioner
here
claims
that
the
union
acted
against
him
based
on
the
fact
that
he
was
a
nlra--
