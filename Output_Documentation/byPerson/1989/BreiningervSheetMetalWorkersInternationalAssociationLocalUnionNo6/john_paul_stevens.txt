mr.
landry,
you
have
been
asked
a
couple
of
questions
about
the
duty
of
fair
representation
claim,
and
each
time
you
have
answered
them
by
talking
about
your
other
claim.
are
you
abandoning
your
duty
of
fair
representation
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
are
you
agreeing
with
justice
scalia
that
it
just
doesn't
apply
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
landry,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
duty
of
fair
representation
claim?
your
opponent
says
in
your
count
1
you
don't
allege
any
intentional
misuse
of
the
hiring
system.
do
you
agree
with
that
reading
of
your
complaint?
in
other
words,
does
your
count
1...
would
your,
the
theory
of
count
1
apply
even
to
a
negligent,
maladministration?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
are
you
saying
that
part
of
your
allegation
in
count
1
is
intentional
discrimination
against
your
client?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
not
necessarily
intentional.
do
you,--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
do
not...
you
agree
that
you...
your
position
is
that
you
don't
have
to
allege
that
it
was
intentional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gold,
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
other
side
of
that
coin
is
that
you
would
agree
that
if
the
allegations
in
count
2
were
included
in
count
1,
namely
that
the
unfair
use
of
the...
alleged
unfair
use
of
the
hiring
clause...
hiring
hall,
was
for
retaliation
against
some
kind
of
activity,
that
would
allege
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
the
allegations
in
count
1
were
made
in
a
charge
before
the
labor
board,
the
labor
board
would
properly
deny
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
it
were
not
for
retaliatory
reasons.
that
is
what
i
am
saying.
count
1,
as
i
understand
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
no.
as
presently
drafted,
count
1
would
not
create...
would
not
allege
facts
justifying
labor
board
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
included
the
allegations
in
count
2
in
count
1,
then
the
labor
board,
under
your
view,
would
have
jurisdiction
and,
therefore,
the
court
would
not,
because
it's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
another
question
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
union,
for
a
non-union
related
reason,
said
they
would
apply...
use
the
hiring
hall
procedure
only
to
recommend
white
applicants
and
not
recommend
any
black
applicants.
that,
i
understand,
would
not
constitute
an
8(b)(2)
violation
because
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
union
status.
and
under
your
view
it
also
would
not
constitute
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
