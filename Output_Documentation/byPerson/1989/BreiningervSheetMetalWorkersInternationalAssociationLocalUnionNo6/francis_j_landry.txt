mr.
francis
j.
landry
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
challenge
by
the
petitioner
to
a
judgment
of
the
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
ohio,
which
was
affirmed
by
the
sixth
circuit,
dismissing
a
two-count
complaint
brought
by
the
petitioner
against
this
labor
union.
the
first
count
was
for
breach
of
duty
of
fair
representation.
the
second
count
was
brought
under
the
landrum-griffin
act.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
case
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
dismissed
it
on
jurisdictional
grounds
inasmuch
as
because
the
case
involved
allegations
that
the
petitioner
was
discriminatorily
refused
job
referrals
on
an
out-of-work
list,
that
the
case
was...
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
board
exclusive
jurisdiction
under
san
diego
building
trades
v.
garmon.
the
district
court
also
held
the
landrum-griffin
act
was
preempted
similarly
under
the
garmon
doctrine.
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
on
the
jurisdictional
basis
and
additionally
added
that,
because
the
out-of-work
list
was
available
to
use
by
members
of
the
union
and
non-members,
it
could
not
constitute
discipline
under
teamsters
v.
leu,
because
non-members
also
could
use
the
out-of-work
list.
this
was
an
issue
which
was
not
reached
by
the
district
court.
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
we
believe,
is
certainly
involved
in
this
case.
the
duty
developed
over
40
years
ago
in
response
to
a
need
by
the
individual
members
of
the
union
to
have
redress
for
arbitrary
union
activity.
in
vaca
v.
sipes
in
1987,
this
court
also
embraced
the
duty
of
fair
representation
again,
subsequent
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
recognition
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation
as
an
unfair
labor
practice
in
miranda
fuel.
the
duty
of
fair
representation
is
a
bulwark
for
redress
by
individual
union
members
for
arbitrary
union
conduct,
and
we
believe
that,
because
there
is
a
congressional
grant
of
exclusive
representation
authority
to
the
individual
labor
unions,
that
the
constitutionality
of
this
grant
would
be
called
into
question
if
the
individual
employee,
the
individual
member
of
the
union,
were
deprived
of
the
right
to
a
judicial
forum
to
redress
arbitrary
conduct.
thus,
we
see
no
reason
to
restrict
the
availability
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
and
any
remedy
for
redress
of
discriminatory
job
referrals
in
this
context
ought
to
be...
the
jurisdiction
ought
to
be
concurrent
with
that
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
additionally,--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--we...
action
which
would--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--not
under
a
duty
of
fair
representation
analysis.
it
could
be
any
arbitrary
discriminatory,
bad
faith,
hostile
conduct,
whether
it
would
be...
constitute
discipline
or
whether
it
would
constitute
other--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--it
needn't...
no.
it
need
not,
under
a
duty
of
fair
representation
analysis,
additionally
under
landrum-griffin
analysis,
it
is
our
contention
that
a
finding
of
discipline
is
not
necessary
for
this
case,
either
for
the
reason
that
the
rights
alleged
to
have
been
infringed
by
the
local
union
under
the
landrum-griffin
claim
involved
free
speech
claims
under
section
101(a)(2)
of
the
landrum-griffin
act.
the
case
involved
allegations
that
the
petitioner
was
soliciting
pencils
which
were
actually
campaign
literature,
and
therefore
these
were
protected...
this
activity
was
protected
by
section
101(a)(2).
and
section
609
of
landrum-griffin
applies
to
discipline
for
engaging
in
protected
activities.
so
that
is
covered.
but
even
if
it
does
not
rise
to
the
level
of
discipline,
the
petitioner
did
plead
section
102--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--with
respect
to
the
duty
of
fair
representation
act...
duty
of
fair
representation
doctrine,
the
cases
have
considered
the
duty
of
fair
representation
of
the
union
to
be
co-extensive
to
its
authority
as
a
representative
of
the
individual.
so--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--we
believe
it...
yes,
it...
it
would,
but
it
could
go
beyond
that
as
far
as
the
unions
negotiation,
collective
bargaining
agreement,
the
administration
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--as
long--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--yes.
however,
rights,
the
landrum-griffin
act
claims,
go
beyond
that
analysis.
and--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--basically
deal
with
the
internal,
the
member's
rights
against
his
own
union.
so,
therefore,
we
believe
that
the
free
speech
claims,
under
your
analysis,
if
the
union
would
send
out
someone
to
physically
harm
a
union
member,
that
would
fall
under
an
infringement
of
title
i
of
the
landrum-griffin
act,
the
bill
of
rights,
and
would
therefore
be
actionable
as
an
infringement.
now,
whether
that
would
constitute
discipline
or
not
would
be...
is
very...
difficult--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--no,
we
are
not
abandoning
it.
we're...
i'm
trying
to--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--we
believe
it
does
apply
in
a
case
like
this,
because
this
contract,
or
this
out-of-work
referral
system,
was
established
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
where
and
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
article
5
of
that
agreement,
places
a
duty
upon
the...
places
a
contractual
obligation
on
the
union
to
furnish
workers
upon
request
by
the
employer.
and
the
employer,
if
he...
can
submit
letters
of
request
to
the
union,
and
after
48
hours
period,
if
the
union
is
unable
to
furnish
sufficient
workers
in
order
to
fulfill
the
employer's
need,
then
the...
at
that
point,
the
employer
can
go
out
and
fill
his
needs
with
other--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--in
effect,
the
union
can...
has
control
over
who
can--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--get
the
job
in
this
particular
case.
so
that
they
are...
they
are
administering
this--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--that's
correct.
in--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--yes,
and
i--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--the
purpose,
justice
scalia,
for
the
enactment
of
the
landrum-griffin
act
in
the
'50s,
was
concern
that
the...
that
there
were
intra-union
problems
that
were
not
being
addressed
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
the
will...
the
purpose
of
this
is
to
ensure
that
there
is
an
overriding
analysis
that
unions
are
democratically
governed
within
themselves
and
responsive
to
the
will
of
the
majority
of
the
union.
now,
the...
there
were...
there
were...
was
concern
in
congress
over
abuses
and
deprivation
of
livelihood
which
were
taking
place
in
the
'50s,
and
the
landrum-griffin
act
was
enacted
in
response
to
those
concerns.
and
there
is
legislative
history
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus...
of
the
amici
curiae
indicating
remarks
made
by
senator
mcclellan
and
senator
kennedy
highlighting
this
particular
fact.
discipline,
the
concept
of
what
would
constitute
discipline,
it
is
our
contention,
can
also
involve
employment
rights
in
this
particular
case
because
the...
we
have
basically
a
job
referral
system
through
a
hiring
hall
system.
and
the
union...
the...
the
whole
purpose
of
the
hiring
hall
is
to
control
who,
and
refer
members
to
jobs.
okay,
now,
the--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--that
is
correct.
we
understand
that,
we
would
concede
that
theoretically,
in
theory,
that
a
non-employee,
a
non-member,
could
make
use
of
the,
of
this
job
referral
system.
however--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--because
we
would
submit
that
the
ability
to
use
job
referrals
and
to
use
the
union...
the
hiring
halls,
which
is
really
a
clearing
house
for
information,
would...
is
a
distinct
membership
and
advantage...
sorry,
distinct
advantage
of
being
a
member
in
the
union.
and
basically
what
the
union--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--yes,
he
is.
but--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--but
it's...
it's
a
feature,
and
it's
an
important
feature
of
union
membership
to
be
able
to
use...
make
use
of
this
hiring
hall.
mr.
francis
j.
landry
how...
however,
for
example,
i
think
in
the
real...
operation
of
the
real
world,
employers
lean
heavily
on
the
use
of
these
hiring
halls,
and
in
order...
in
depriving
a
union
member
of
the
use
of
a
hiring
hall,
what
you're
telling
that
union
member
is
that
the
only
way
you
are
going
to
come
back
here,
if
it
is
for
a
reason
that,
under...
if
it
is
for
a
protected
reason,
as
we
have
here,
you
are
telling
that
union
member
that
look,
either
you
recant
your
position
opposing
our
union
leadership,
or
leave
the
union.
mr.
francis
j.
landry
but
the
statute,
section
609,
does
refer
to
other...
otherwise
discipline
as
well.
mr.
francis
j.
landry
however--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--however,
this
union
out
of
work
referral
list
is
administered
by
the
officials
of
the
union,
and
when...
for...
when
you
have
facts
as
we
have
in
this
case,
that
the...
that
the
petitioner
opposed
the
then-in-power
union
leadership,
and...
and
when
the
leadership,
under
color
of
their...
their...
of
the
union's
authority,
or
under
color
of
their
authority
as
leaders
in
the
union,
seek
to
deprive
a
union
member
of
this
right
to
obtain
referrals
under
that
system,
then
they
are
affecting
his...
they
are
using
their
authority
as
union
leaders
to
affect
his
rights
as
a
member
that
he
would
otherwise
have.
mr.
francis
j.
landry
we
believe
there
might
be
a
line
to
be
drawn
in...
in
that
area,
and
it
is
a
very
difficult
one
to
draw.
the
use
of...
the
deprivation
of
jobs
basically
is
forcing
that
union
member
to
choose
between
protected
rights
or
the
loss...
or
the
fear
of
the
loss
of
job
opportunities,
or
job
reprisals.
at
some
point,
again,
there
would
have
to
be
a
penalty,
some
sort
of
penalty
which
would
be
involved.
at
some
point,
if
there
is
clearly
unauthorized
activity,
for
example,
physical
abuse,
we
believe
that
that
might
fall
under
infringement
if
it
was
for
protective
activity;
it
may
not
fall
under
the
term
discipline.
however,
it
appears
that
discipline
such
as...
such
as
restricting
union
member
from
the
use
of
job
referrals
is
a
traditional
form
of
discipline
which
is
used
in
some
cases.
for
example,
90-day
benching,
which
means
taking
them
off
the
list
for
90
days,
is
commonly
used.
mr.
francis
j.
landry
that...
that,
we
believe,
may
constitute
an
infringement
of
rights.
it
may
not
be
discipline
because
it
is
not
a
traditional
type
of--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--which
we
believe
would
be
guaranteed
under...
if
it
were
for
protected
activities,
some
sort
of
reprisal
infringement,
that
would
be
covered
under
101(a)(2),
made...
made
actionable
through
102,
free
speech.
mr.
francis
j.
landry
if
his
free
speech
rights
were
violated.
it...
it...
but
the
point
is
it
would
be
an
infringement--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--we
don't...
we...
we
believe
that
might
be
stretching
the
concept
of
discipline
too
far,
if
it
is
not
a
traditional
form
of
discipline
of
some
sort.
mr.
francis
j.
landry
well,
it...
if
we
are
going
to
use
the
word
discipline
as
a
way
of
distinguishing
activity,
perhaps
the
court
could
make
infringements...
make
any
of
this
activity
actionable
as
an
infringement
under
101(a)(2)
and
102,
or
actionable
under
102.
mr.
francis
j.
landry
we
believe
that
in
the
concept
of
negligence
under
the
decisions
of
the
courts
would
not
be
enough
to
constitute
a
duty
of
fair
representation.
however,
we
have
alleged
arbitrary
discriminatory
conduct
without--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--we
believe
a
fair
reading
of
that
would
indicate
it's
intentional.
but
we
believe
that
arbitrary
conduct
should
be
enough
to
rise
to
duty
of
fair
representation...
breach
of
a
duty
of
fair
representation.
now,
arbitrary
is
something
more
than
negligence;
it
is
a
perfunctoriness
which--
mr.
francis
j.
landry
--not
necessarily.
mr.
francis
j.
landry
that
is
correct.
mr.
francis
j.
landry
i
believe
that
we
have
pleaded
facts
in
the...
in
the
second
claim
for
relief
sufficient
to
give
a
basis
for
ruling
that
this
is
an
infringement.
we
have
also
pleaded
section
102
of
the
landrum-griffin
act,
that's
29
united
states
code
412,
which
is
in
there,
which
makes
any
violation
of
any
title
i
right
actionable.
and
that,
plus
the
fact
that
we
have
a
free
speech
problem
in
this
case,
we
believe
that
although
we've
not
specifically
enumerated
the
101(a)(2)
free
speech
section,
that
the
facts
actually
have
been
pleaded
under
a
fair
reading
of
the
complaint.
and
considering
that
this
is
a
very
preliminary...
this
was
a
preliminary
stage.
the...
basically
the
district
court
ruled
on
the
jurisdiction
aspect
and
never
really
reached
the
discipline
aspect,
that
therefore
the
court
could
rule
in
our
favor
on
that...
on
that
rationale.
i
wish
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
