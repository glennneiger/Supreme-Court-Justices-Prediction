mr.
david
l.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
brief
time
available
to
us,
i
would
like
to
focus
on
count
1
of
the
complaint,
in
which
the
petitioner
alleges
that
the
union
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation
to
the
petitioner
by
arbitrarily
and
discriminatorily
refusing
to
refer
him
to
employment
through
the
union
hiring
hall.
the
courts
below
held
that
this
claim
fell
within
the
exclusive
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
and
for
that
reason,
the
count
had
to
be
dismissed.
we
contend,
with
petitioner,
that
that
decision
was
in
error
for
essentially
three
interrelated
reasons.
first,
the
duty
of
fair
representation
itself.
the
duty
of
the
exclusive
representative
to
behave
fairly
in
representing
all
members
of
the
bargaining
unit
is
a
duty
that
is
of
fundamental
importance
in
the
administration
of
the
federal
labor
laws.
second,
this
court
has
recognized
in
a
number
of
cases
that
the
federal
courts
have
served
and
need
to
continue
to
serve
as
primary
guardians
of
that
duty.
and
finally,
there
is
no
basis
in
the
law
or
in
sound
policy
for
any
exception
for
this
particular
case
from
the
judicial
enforceability
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
either
because
the
case
involves
a
hiring
[inaudible]
or
for
any
other
reason.
first,
with
respect
to
the
fundamental
importance
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
it's
true
that
that
duty
is
not
expressed
in
explicit
terms
in
either
the
railway
labor
act
or
the
national
labor
relations
act,
but
this
court
has
said
that
the
duty
is
implied
in
the
strongest
possible
sense.
it
is
implied,
this
court
said
in
the
emporium
case,
from
the
very
nature
of
the
union's
right
of
exclusive
representation
when
it
is
chosen
by
a
majority.
or,
as
this
court
said
in
the
foust
case,
it
is
inseparable
from
that
duty.
the
reason
for
that,
we
think,
is
clear.
when
these
statutes,
the
railway
labor
act
and
the
nlra,
were
enacted
they
operated
to
take
away
from
minorities
and
from
the
individual
the
ability
they
previously
had
to
bargain
for
themselves
with
the
employer.
from
now
on
a
union
that
was
chosen
by
the
majority
had
the
exclusive
right
to
bargain
for
all
the
employees
in
the
unit.
if
the
employees
themselves
were
not
left
with
some
relative
duty
imposed
on
the
union,
serious
questions
of
fairness
would
be
presented.
and
indeed,
since
the
union's
authority
was
conferred
by
congress,
those
questions
might
rise
to
issues
of
equal
protection
or
due
process.
it's
partly
for
that
reason,
we
believe,
that
this
court
has
recognized,
the
czosek
case
is
a
very
good
example,
that
the
federal
courts
are
the
primary
guardians
of...
of
this
very
important
duty.
for
one
thing,
the
duty
itself
was
first
recognized
by
this
court
in
the
steele
case.
it
has
been
continued
to
be
developed,
refined,
articulated
by
this
court
and
by
the
lower
federal
courts.
secondly,
as
this
court
said
in
vaca
against
sipes,
the
enforceability
of
this
basic
duty
should
not
be
left
to
the
unreviewable
discretion
of
the
general
counsel
of
the
labor
board,
and
indeed
should
not
turn
on
the
labor
board's
decision,
which
it
is
wholly
authorized
to
make
in
the
allocation
of
its
resources,
not
to
exercise
its
jurisdiction
below
a
certain
monetary
threshold.
the
mere
fact
that
an
employee
may
be
working
in
a
business
that
does
not
meet
that
particular
monetary
threshold
should
not
be
that
he
is
deprived
of
the
ability
to
enforce
his
right
of
fair
representation.
moreover,
and
i
think
this
goes
perhaps
to
a
question
asked
earlier
by
justice
o'connor,
the
scope
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
protecting
as
it
does
against
all
arbitrary
treatment
in
the
employment
relationship,
may
well
be
broader
than
the
ability
of
the
board
to
enforce
certain
obligations
that
are
created
by
the
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
the
union
has
argued
very
forcefully
in
its
brief
for
the
proposition
that
some
forms
of
arbitrary
treatment
do
not
fall
under
the
unfair
labor
practice
provisions
of
the
act.
the
labor
board,
of
course,
disagrees
with
that
position.
the
government
disagrees
with
that
position.
but
if
it's
correct
it
strengthens
the
position
we
are
taking
here,
because
the
effect
of
it
would
be
to
leave
essentially
unenforced
the
guides
of
arbitrary
treatment
that
may
fall
outside
the
particular
scope
of
the
labor
board's
responsibility.
despite
the
union's
contention
in
this
case,
we
do
not
read
the
national
labor
relations
act,
the
taft-hartley
amendments
of
1947,
which
created
new
union
unfair
labor
practices,
as
in
any
sense
authorizing
or
licensing
unions
to
engage
in
broader
forms
of
arbitrary
discrimination
of
the
kind
that
this
court
so
vigorously
condemned
only
three
years
earlier
in
the
steele
case.
that,
then,
leaves
the
question,
we
believe,
whether
there
can
or
should
be
some
exception
to
this
general
availability
of
a
judicial
forum
for
this
kind
of
case.
we
believe
that
there
should
not.
in
the
first
place,
the
enforceability
of
this
duty
is
not
limited
to
cases
in
which
the
plaintiff
is
also
bringing
a
301
claim
for
breach
of
contract
against
the
employer.
this
court
has
made
that
clear
in
a
number
of
cases,
starting
as
early
as
lockridge,
almost
20
years
ago,
and
as
recently
as
communications
workers,
only
two
years
ago,
that
the
duty
of
fair
representation
extends
beyond
the
hybrid
action
to
cases
involving
the
negotiation,
the
administration
of
collective
agreements.
and,
indeed,
in
lockridge
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
duty
need
not
be
bottomed
on
a
collective
agreement
at
all.
nor
do
we
believe
that
there
is
any
justification
for
excepting
hiring
hall
cases
from
the
scope
of
enforcement
of
this
duty.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
there
may
be,
your
honor,
because
the--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--the
allegations
of
the
lmrda
claim
may
well
turn
on
the
allegation
in
count
2,
that
the
reason
why
he
was
denied
the
use
of
the
hiring
hall
was
because
he
engaged
in
political
activity
in
support
of
those
who
did
not
win
the
election.
certainly
to
make
out
a
free
speech
claim
under
the
bill
of
rights,
that
allegation
has
to
be
borne
out.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
and
it
may
also
be--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--correct.
the
nlra--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--oh,
i
see.
i
believe
that
may
well
be
true,
if
he
can
make
out
all
the
elements
that
are
necessary
to
recovery
on
count
1.
then
that,
i
think,
probably
fairly
embraces
the
claim
that
is
made
under
count
2.
the...
the
converse
is
not
true.
he
may
be
able
to
sustain
his
claim
under
count
1,
but
not
under
count
2.
as
i
was
saying,
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
basis
for
an
exception
simply
because
this
case
involves
a
hiring
hall.
in
the
first
place,
many
claims
of
breach
of
duty
of
fair
representation
that
involve
hiring
halls
are
accompanied
by
claims
that
there
has
been
a
breach
of
contract
under
301;
they
are
hybrid
claims.
this
case
involves
a
hybrid
claim
in
another
sense,
that
is
that
the
claim
for
breach
of
duty
is
coupled
with
a
very
closely
related
claim
under
the
lmrda.
finally,
it
would
be
strange
indeed
to
say
to
an
employee
you
may
pursue
a
fair
representation
claim
with
respect
to
matters
of
promotion,
transfer,
even
discharge,
but
not
with
the
basic
right
of
employment
through
a
union
hiring
hall.
union
hiring
halls
serve
very
valuable
functions
in
the
administration
of
the
employment
system
in
this
country.
but
they
are
capable
of
very
substantial
abuse.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
