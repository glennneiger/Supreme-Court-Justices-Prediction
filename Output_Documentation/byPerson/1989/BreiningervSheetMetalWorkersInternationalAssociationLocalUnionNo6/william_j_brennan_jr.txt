justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit.
the
case
presents
two
questions
under
the
federal
labor
laws.
first,
whether
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
a
union
member’s
claims
that
his
union
both
breached
its
duty
of
fair
representation
and
violated
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act
of
1959
by
discriminating
against
him
in
job
referrals
made
by
the
union
hiring
hall.
and
second,
whether
the
union’s
alleged
refusal
to
refer
him
to
employment
through
the
hiring
hall
as
a
result
of
his
political
opposition
to
union’s
leadership
gives
rise
to
a
claim
under
sections
101(a)(5)
and
609
of
the
labor
management
relations
and
disclosure
act.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
petitioner’s
suit
fell
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
board
and
that
petitioner
had
failed
to
state
a
claim
under
the
lmrda.
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
petitioner’s
suit
falls
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
board,
but
affirm
the
holding
that
petitioner
did
not
state
a
claim
under
the
labor
management
reporting
and
disclosure
act.
our
reasons
are
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today.
the
opinion
is
unanimous
with
respect
to
parts
1
and
2
and
the
opinion
of
the
court
with
respect
to
part
three
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
white,
marshall,
blackmun,
o’connor,
and
kennedy
join.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
scalia
joins.
