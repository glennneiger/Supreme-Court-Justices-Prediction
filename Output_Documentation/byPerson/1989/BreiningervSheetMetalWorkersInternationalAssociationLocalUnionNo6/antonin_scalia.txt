justice

scalia
to
violate
the
national
labor
relations
act,
however,
doesn't
the
action
have
to
relate
to
the
individuals
rights
as
an
employee?
would...
would...
would
it
be
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
unfair...
duty
of
fair
representation,
for
the
union
to
send
some
goons
over
to
break
up
the...
you
know,
on
the
waterfront.
johnny
friendly
sends
over
some
mobsters
to
destroy
somebody's
house,
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
employment
rights
of
the
individual.
would
that
be
a
failure
of
the
duty
of...
i
mean,
it
may
be
criminal,
but
would
that
violate
the
national
labor
relations
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
as
a
representative
vis
a
vis
the
employer.
isn't
that
right?
i
mean,
the
very
term
representation,
it...
it
has
to
relate
to
the
employee's
rights
against
the
employer,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
which
relate
to
what
the
individual
employee
gets
from
the
employer.
no?
do
you
know
any
case
that
doesn't
in...
like
jobs,
like
salary,
like
working
conditions
and
so
forth.
do
you
know
any
case
that
doesn't
involve
the
employee's
relation
to
his
employer?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
prospective
employer.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
in
case
you
are
in
any
confusion,
my
problem
is
not
whether
the
duty
of
fair
representation
applies
to
this.
i...
i
think
it
does.
my
problem
is
whether
the
disciplinary
provision
applies
to
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
going
to
address
that
one?
you...
you...
you
said
the
word
discipline
could
be
narrower.
why
isn't
it
narrower?
why
doesn't
it
relate
only
to
taking
away
rights
that
are
distinctive
to
the
union
employee,
his
rights
as
a
union
member,
as
opposed
to
his
rights
as
an
employee,
whether
he
is
a
union
member
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
just
union
members.
everybody.
right?
i
mean,
any
employee?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
is
depriving
of
that
a
union
discipline,
any
more
than,
you
know,
you
speak
of
the
bar
disciplining
one
of
its
members.
that
doesn't
mean
sending
up
some...
somebody
out
to
smash
his
house,
and
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
mean
prosecuting
him
criminally.
it
means
depriving
him
of
some
of
his
unique,
distinctive
advantages
as
a
member
of
the
bar.
why
doesn't
union
discipline
mean
the
same
thing?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
i
thought
a
non-union
member
was
entitled
to
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then,
it
is
not
distinctive
to
the
union.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
also
an
important
feature
of
non-union
membership.
it's
like
breathing
in
and
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
may...
maybe...
i...
i...
no
doubt
it's
a
failure
of
a
duty
of
fair
representation
to
deprive
any
member,
union
or
not,
of
that...
of
that
feature,
but
every
time
the
word
discipline
is
used
in
the
statute,
the
word
discipline
that
you
are
relying
upon,
it...
it's
part
of
a
whole
series
of
words.
it
says
no
member
may
be
fined,
suspended,
expelled
or
otherwise
disciplined.
that...
that
means,
to
me,
internal,
internal
sanctions
relating
to
union
membership,
not
something
totally
external.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it's
in
a
series
of
words,
and
it's
standard
statutory
construction
that...
that
one
word
in
another
series
is...
is
colored
by
those
other
words.
and
the
only
other
words
put
in
there
are
all
internal
stuff:
fined,
expelled,
suspended
or
otherwise
disciplined.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
find
it
very
strange
to
think
that
that
means
anything
except
something
pertaining
to
your
status
qua
union
member.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
breaking
his
leg?
i
mean,
the
johnny
friendly
example
again.
the
union...
union
leader
sends
over
a
mobster
to
break
his
leg
for
opposing
the
union
leadership.
is
that
discipline?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
there
are
infringements
of
rights
that
are
not
discipline,
and...
and...
and
some
things,
some
protections
of
the
union
members'
rights
under
title
xxix
have
to
be
guaranteed
in
other
ways
than
under
this...
the
lmra.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how?
102
says
have
been
infringed
by
violation
of
this
title.
any
persons
whose
rights
secured
by
this
title
have
been
infringed
by
violation
of
this
title.
breaking
his
leg
would
not
be
a
violation
of
this
title,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're...
you're
not
reading
the
full
provision.
it
says
any
person
whose
rights
secured
by
this
title
are
infringed
by
a
violation
of
this
title.
now,
the
rights...
you
say
the
rights
are
secured,
right,
but
they
have
to
be
infringed
by
a
violation.
and
breaking
someone's
leg
is
not
a
violation
of
this
title,
as
far
as
i
know.
unless
you
think
that
it
that
it's
discipline.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you
don't
stretch
it
all
the
way
then
your...
then
your
strongest
argument
for
stretching
it
at
all
is
gone,
that
somehow
this
section
has
to
be
self
contained
and
every
possible
infringement
of
the
right
of
the
union
member
has
to
be
punishable
under
this
title
and
nowhere
else.
it
seems
to
me
you
are
acknowledging
that
there
are
some
that
are
not
punishable
under
this
title.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
shapiro,
may
i...
may
i
ask...
am
i
correct
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
as
far
as
this
claimant
is
concerned,
if
we
uphold
the
lmrda
claim,
so
long
as
we
uphold
the
nlra
claim.
is...
is
there
any
reason
why
he
needs
both?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
means
he
has
to
go
beyond
the
nlra
claim
in
order
to
make
out
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so,
if
the
nlra
claim
is
upheld,
he
has
gotten
everything
that...
he
can't
get
further
relief
in
addition
because
of
the...
of
the
lmrda
claim,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
tell
me
again,
i
guess
i
am
a
little
slow
on
this,
tell...
tell
me
why
the...
neither...
neither
an
unfair
labor
practice
nor
a
duty
of
fair
representation
claim
would
lie,
in
that
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
right,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
ulp
would
not
lie
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
when
the
union
takes
over
the
employers
prerogatives,
there's
nobody
to
be
represented
to,
except
the
union
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gold,
isn't...
isn't
there
a
fundamental
difference,
where
the
employer
refuses
to
hire
somebody,
he
is
not
standing
in
a...
in
a...
in
a
trust
relationship
to
that
individual
that
he
refuses
to
hire.
where
the
union
refuses
to
hire...
to
hire
somebody,
the
union
has
specifically
been...
been
approved
by
congress
as
someone
who
is
supposed
to
represent
employees,
who
has
a
special
relationship
of
care
and...
and...
and
representation
for
them.
so
to
say,
you
know,
the
employer
can
get
away
with
it,
so
the
union
should
be
able
to
get
away
with
it
too
without
violating
the
labor
laws,
is...
it's
not
persuasive.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gold,
i
might,
i...
i...
i
might
agree
with
you
as
an
original
matter,
but
isn't
that
water
over
the
dam?
haven't
we...
didn't
we
create
duty
of
air
representation
when...
when
the
board
itself
had
not
yet
determined
that
there
existed
any
such
thing
which
could
be
an
unfair
labor
practice.
