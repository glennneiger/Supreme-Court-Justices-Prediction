mr.
landry,
do
you
take
the
position
that
any
action
by
the
union
that
harms
one
of
its
members
is
actionable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
doesn't
have
to
be
discipline.

so
it
isn't
necessary,
in
your
view
in
this
case,
for
it
to
constitute
disciplinary
action.
that's
not
important.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gold,
i
take
it,
by
virtue
of
your
focus
exclusively
on
the
nlra
aspect
of
the
argument,
that
you
are
not
so
concerned
then
about
the
fact
that
there
may
be
a
statutory
cause
of
action
under
lmrda.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
there
is
a
section
102
claim
made
on
the
face
of
the
complaint?
