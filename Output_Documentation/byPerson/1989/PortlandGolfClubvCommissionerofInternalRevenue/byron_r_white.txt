the
profit
motive
in
this
case?
justice
white
and
once
you've
got
a
business
you've
got
a
business?
justice
white
well,
you
want
to--
justice
white
--you
want
to
explain
it...
get
down
to
what
the
government's
contention
really
is.
justice
white
how
it
works
out.
justice
white
yeah,
but
the
problem
here
is
whether...
is
whether
certain
deductions
can
be
taken
against
investment
income.
is
that
right?
justice
white
and...
but
it
isn't
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
or
not
you've
got
a
gain
or
loss
on
your
non-member
activities.
you
can
deduct
both
the
direct
expenses
and
the
indirect
expenses.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
but
the
only
issue
is
whether
that
loss
can
be
taken
against
other
unrelated
income?
justice
white
if
it
was...
if
there
was
a
precondition
of
a
profit
motive
for
a
trade
or
business
under
this
section,
i
don't
suppose
you'd
allow
any
deductions,
because
it
wouldn't
be
a
trade
or
business
at
all.
justice
white
xxx
you
want
to
claim
these...
you
want
to
claim
these
overhead
expenses
as...
as
deductible
and
yet
you
want
to
disregard
them
to
show
that
you
have
a
profit
motive.
justice
white
it's
cash
flow.
justice
white
it's
cash
flow.
justice
white
well,
mr.
sloan,
do
you...
do
you
agree
that...
that
these
sort
of
indirect
expenses
are
deductible
for
the
purpose
of
determining
whether
there's
a
profit
or
loss
on
non-member
activities?
justice
white
i'm
talking
about
the
overhead
items.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
on
the...
on
the
non-member
activity?
justice
white
and
if
it's...
and
if
there's
a
profit,
there's
a
tax?
justice
white
and
if
there's
a
loss,
there's
no
tax
but
you
say
that
can't
be
set
off
against
other
non-member
income?
justice
white
because?
justice
white
is
there
a
regulation
to
this
effect?
justice
white
i
didn't
ask
that.
is
there
a
regulation?
justice
white
has
there
ever...
has
there
been
a
proposed
regulation?
justice
white
how
long...
how
long
has
the
service
taken
this
position
that
you're
urging?
justice
white
consistently?
justice
white
and
before
that?
justice
white
i
don't...
see,
where
is
there
room
under
the
section
512(a)(3)
for
insisting
on
this
profit
motive?
the...
the...
as
you
described
it,
(3)(a)
says
that
you
figure
all
your
gross
income
and
then
take
out
the
exempt
income
and...
but
after
you've
taken
out
the
exempt
income
you
can
deduct
from
the
gross
income
that's
left
all
of
the
deductible
expenses.
justice
white
and
it
doesn't
separate
out
investment
income
from
other
kind
of
income.
you
just
add
it
all
up
and
you
take
your...
how
do
you--
justice
white
--well,
yeah,
but
it...
this
doesn't
require
a
trade
or
business,
(3)(a).
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
well,
there's
just
nothing...
there's
no
necessity
to
have
a
trade
or
business
in
(3)(a).
justice
white
it
sounds
like
you're
really
relying
on
a
general
rule
that...
that
if
you
have
more
expenses
than
you
have
income
from
a
nonprofit
activity,
you
can't
apply
that...
those
excess
expenses
to
any
income
from
any
other
source.
justice
white
now,
what
authority
do
you
have
for
that?
justice
white
i
say
you...
you
cite...
you
cite
boris
bitker
and
you
cite
two
court
of
appeals
cases.
justice
white
do
you
have
anything
from
a...
you
have
no
regulation
for
it,
no
regulation
for
it.
you
have
nothing
expressed
in
the
code
for
it.
and
you
have
no...
no
decision
from
this
court
on
it.
justice
white
yes.
eighth
circuit.
uh-huh.
justice
white
well,
there's
no...
no...
there's
no
provision
in
the
code
preventing
it
either.
justice
white
you
put
the...
you
say
that--
justice
white
--that's
just
bootstrapping.
justice
white
well,
he
says
that--
justice
white
--he
says,
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
my...
what
my
taxable
income
is.
i've
had
these
expenses,
i'm
out
of
pocket.
why
should
i
have
to
pay
tax?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
he...
he
says,
i've
got
some
other
income,
but
if
i...
but
i'm
still
out
of
pocket
because
i've
had
more
expenses
than
i've
had
income.
justice
white
so
you...
so
you
say
that
it's...
there's
just
this
general
principle
that
we
ought
to
accept
that
you
can
only...
in
a
nonprofit
activity
you
can
only
apply
expenses
to
that
income?
justice
white
well,
if
you
didn't
allow...
there
wouldn't
be
much
of
a
problem
if
you
didn't
allow
these...
not
only
the
direct
costs
but
the
overhead
deduction?
justice
white
but
(a)...
(a)(3)
says
directly
connected
with
the
production--
justice
white
--and
yet
you
seem
to
allow
indirect
deductions.
justice
white
yeah.
justice
white
but
if
you
lose
this
case,
you
won't
be
out
much
money
if
you...
if
you
don't
allow
these
deductions.
justice
white
not
if
you
didn't
allow
these--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
xxx
rely
on...
don't
you
rely
on
162
for
what
expenses
you
can
deduct?
justice
white
well,
if
there's
a
general
rule...
if
there's
a
general
rule
that
you...
that
nonprofit
activities
shouldn't
generate
a
loss
to
offset
against
other
income...
is
there
a
general
rule
like
that
or
not?
justice
white
well,
there's
two
courts
of
appeals
that
say
there
is.
justice
white
well,
is
a
proposed
regulation
in
effect?
justice
white
i
just
heard
from
the
government
that
their
position...
present
position
they've
followed
consistently.
justice
white
do
you
have
you
any
evidence
of
that?
justice
white
so...
a
manual?
justice
white
is
that
before
us?
i
mean,
is
that
available?
