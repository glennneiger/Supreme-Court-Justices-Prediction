well,
doesn't
the
statute
refer
to
deductions
allowed
by
this
chapter?
so
doesn't
that
incorporate
of
necessity
any
provisions
in
the
chapter
that
might
determine
what
deductions
are
proper?
justice
o'connor
all
right.
and
the
sg,
the
solicitor
general,
says,
and
that
includes
section
162.
justice
o'connor
and
that
section
has
been
interpreted
as
incorporating
a
profit
motive.
justice
o'connor
for
a
trade
or
business.
justice
o'connor
mr.
sloan,
do
you
accept
the
ninth
circuit's
definition
of
profit
explained
in
that
north
ridge
case,
which
is
that
the
production
of
gains
in
excess
of
all
direct
and
indirect
costs--
justice
o'connor
--indicates
a
profit?
justice
o'connor
but,
mr.
sloan,
under
your
reading
of
the
code
it
would
be
open
to
the
commissioner
to
take
the
position
that,
absent
a
profit
motive,
no
expenses
are
deductible
and
you
might
be
back
here
next
year
with
that
position.
justice
o'connor
apparently
you
would
defend
that
as
a
proper
reading
of
the
statute.
justice
o'connor
i
know,
but
your
legal
position
would
leave
open
that
position--
justice
o'connor
--to
be
taken
by
the
commissioner
in
another
case
on
another
day.
