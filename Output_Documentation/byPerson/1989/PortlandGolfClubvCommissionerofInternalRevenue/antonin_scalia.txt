justice
scalia
may
i
ask
you,
what...
what
do
you
say
about
the
government's
main
argument
that...
that
the
theory
you
urge
would
frustrate
the
whole
purpose
of
the
provision,
which
is
not
to
let
people
who
are
spending
money
on
their
own
entertainment
in...
in
effect
to
get
tax
deductions
for
it
by
allowing
their
investment
income
that
is
used
for
that
activity
to
be
tax-free.
justice
scalia
how
does
this
gross-to-gross
allocation
method
work?
would
you
explain
it
to
me?
suppose...
suppose
i
have
a
club
that...
it...
it
originally
serves
only
members,
and
are
there
are
100...
there
are
100
members.
and
then...
then
it
decides
it
will
serve
non-members
as
well,
and
it
serves
one
non-member.
now,
what
is
the
effect,
under
your
system,
of
serving
that
one
non-member?
what
would
go
along
to
be
deducted
from
what
would
otherwise
be
the
profit
from
the
sales
to
the
non-member?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
on
the
non-member
business?
justice
scalia
but
when
you
say
non-member
business,
you
mean
income
from
non-members.
justice
scalia
you
would
count
member
dues
as
part
of
the
member
business?
justice
scalia
well,
you
accept
it
for
one
purpose
but
not
for
the
other.
just...
just
as
in
your
opponent's
second
argument
he
would
accept
it
for
one
purpose
but
not
for
another.
justice
scalia
you
accept
it
for...
for
purposes
of
deciding
whether
it's
a
profit-motivated
business
but
you
reject
it
for
purposes
of
deciding
whether
it's
a...
it's
a
proper
deduction
from
the
business.
you...
you
want
to
segment
the
business
for
purposes
of
the
deduction
but
insist
that
it
be
looked
upon
as
an
inseparable
whole
for
purposes
of
whether
there's
a
profit
motive.
justice
scalia
now,
isn't
that
a
fair
characterization?
i
mean,
because
i
could
say
there's
a
profit
motive.
you
know,
i
want
to
make
as
much
money
as
i
can
from...
have
these
facilities
lying
fallow,
the
marginal
costs
are
negligible.
whatever
i
make
on
the
sandwiches
i
sell
to
non-members
is...
is
gravy.
that's
a
profit
motive
if
you
look
at
it
one
way.
but
you
insist,
no,
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
business.
you
have
to
consider
the...
all
the
club
facilities
that
go
behind
selling
this
one
sandwich
and
you
say
that's
no
profit
motive.
well,
you
know,
in
a
real
sense
it
is
a
profit
motive.
for
that
purpose,
you
want
to
segment
the
two...
the...
the...
or
you
want
to
merge
the
two.
but
then
for
the
other
purpose
of
whether
you
can
take
the
deduction,
you
say,
oh,
no,
that
these
two
things
are
entirely
separate.
justice
scalia
when
you
compute
if
they're
making
a
profit
from
their...
sandwich
business,
they
wouldn't
be
making
a
profit
if...
if
they're
simply
getting
back
more
than
marginal
costs.
they
would
have
to
get
back
more
than--
justice
scalia
--the
combination
of
the
marginal
and
direct?
justice
scalia
that's
very
generous
of
you,
of
course,
because
that
never
happens,
does
it?
[laughter]
does
it
ever
happen?
justice
scalia
mr.
henzke,
how
does
the
service
handle
sales
under...
under
512(a)(1)
by...
by
a
non...
non-social
club?
suppose
a
museum
sells
sandwiches
and
in
fact
it's...
it's
a
loss
operation
if
you
take
into
account
all
the
expenses.
is
that
considered
a
trade
or
business?
justice
scalia
that
it's
a
trade
or
business.
justice
scalia
do
they
require,
for
purposes
of
trade
or
business,
the
same
thing
that
they
want
to
require
of
you
here?
that
is,
that
the
museum
would
be
making
a
profit
if
you
took
into
account
the
overall
costs
and
not
just
the
marginal
costs?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i'm
asking
is,
would
they
consider
it
to
be
a
profit
motive
if
all
you're
trying
to
do
is
make
a
marginal
cost
and...
and
it's
a
loss
operation,
net?
would
they--
