we'll

89-530,
the
portland
golf
club
v.
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue.
mr.
henzke.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
henzke,
where
will
we
find
these
sections?
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
in
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--the
one
you...
the
appendix
to
your
petition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
appendix
to
the
brief.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the...
the
blue
brief?
chief
justice
rehnquist
oh,
i've
got
the
wrong
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
you
had...
if
you
had
made
money
on
these
member...
non-member
transactions,
you
would
have
been
required
to
report
any
gain
from
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
whether
or
not
you
had
a
profit
motive?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and...
and
you
count
expenses...
income
received
from
guests
of
members
as
member
expenses
and
not
non-member
expenses,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
can
a
non-member
pay
a
bill?
i
mean,
is
that
the
custom
at
the
club,
that
the
non-member
can
pay
the
bill
just
as
readily
as
the
member?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
henzke.
mr.
sloan.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
act
was
passed
in
1969?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
they
do...
section
512(a)(1)
does
refer
to
unrelated
business
taxable
income.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so
what
we're
saying
in
that
section,
we're
dealing
with
a
business.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
uses
the
same
thing
in
512(a)(3)(a).
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
seems
to
me
you're
relying
on
a...
on
a
broader
principle,
and
that
is
that
the
burden
is
on
the
taxpayer
to
justify
any
deduction.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
have
a
defense
to
each
of
their
arguments
as
to
why
they
could
get
a
deduction.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
why
if
they're
not
engaged
in
a
business
for
profit
they...
they...
to
offset,
don't
they
have
to
point
to
some
section
that
authorizes
a
deduction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
not
a
deduction,
you're
saying?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sloan.
mr.
henzke,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
henzke.
the
case
is
submitted.
