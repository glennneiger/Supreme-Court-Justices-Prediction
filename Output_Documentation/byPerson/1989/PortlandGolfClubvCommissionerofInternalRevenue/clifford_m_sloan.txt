mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1969
congress
enacted
a
provision
addressing
the
tax
treatment
of
the
income
of
social
clubs
and
in
that
provision
congress
treated
social
clubs
differently
from
other
tax-exempt
organizations.
with
respect
to
other
tax-exempt
organizations,
congress
imposed
a
tax
only
on
the
income
from
an
unrelated
trade
or
business.
with
respect
to
social
clubs,
congress
imposed
a
tax
on
all
income
except
for
what
was
called
the
exempt
function
income
which
was
primarily
the
payments
from
members
for
the
purposes
of
the
club.
congress
was
explicit
in
the
legislative
history
about
the
reason
for
this
different
treatment.
with
respect
to
other
tax-exempt
organizations,
the
concern
was
a
concern
about
unfair
competition.
it
was
a
concern
that
if
a
tax-exempt
organization
engaged
in
a
trade
or
business
in
competition
with
a
taxable
entity,
the
tax-exempt
organization
would
have
an
unfair
competitive
advantage.
with
respect
to
social
clubs,
congress
explicitly
stated
in
the
legislative
history
that
there
was
that
concern,
but
there
was
another
concern
as
well.
and
the
additional
concern
had
to
do
with
the
entire
reason
for
the
exemption
for
social
clubs
in
the
first
place.
the
reason
for
the
exemption
for
social
clubs
was
so
as
not
to
penalize
individuals
for
coming
together
and
pooling
their
resources
for
their
pleasure
and
recreation
activities.
but
congress
specifically
noted,
to
the
extent
that
outside
income
was
not
taxed,
it
represented
a
tax
subsidy.
and
in
the
words
of
congress,
such
a
subsidy
would
be
a
distortion
of
the
purpose
of
the
exemption.
well,
in
the
legislative
history
congress
specifically
identified
investment
income
as
the
kind
of
income
that
it
sought
to
tax
of
social
clubs,
and
it
specifically
identified
the
failure
to
tax
investment
income
as
the
kind
of
tax
subsidy
that
it
sought
to
prevent.
for
the
tax
years
in
question,
petitioner
received
more
than
$33,000
in
income
from
its
investments.
yet,
petitioner
claims
that
it
is
entitled
to
pay
no
taxes
on
that
investment
income
because
petitioner
claims
that
what
congress
actually
did
in
1969
was
create
a
special
favorable
tax
rule
for
social
clubs
in
which,
unlike
other
taxpayers,
social
clubs
can
deduct
losses
from
an
activity
and
apply
those
losses
to
another
activity
and
offset
the
income
and
eliminate
any
tax
on
it
without
any
showing
that
the
activity
generating
the
losses
was
engaged
in
for
profit.
alternatively,
petitioner
suggests
that
it
should
be
able
to
claim
that
certain
expenses
are
directly
connected
to
the
production
of
income
for
the
purpose
of
claiming
deductions
and
at
the
same
time
deny
that
they
are
related
to
the
production
of
income
at
all
for
the
purpose
of
evaluating
the
profit
motive.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
for
it...
well,
let's
see.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
completely
understand
the
question.
in
terms
of
whether
they
are
deductible?
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
right.
the
allocation
of
indirect
costs.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
we
think
that
those
costs
that
are
allocated
should
be
considered
in
evaluating
whether
the
club
had
a
profit
or
not.
yes.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
on
the
non-member
activity.
yes.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's
right.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
because
the
activity
was
not
engaged
in
for
profit.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
there's
a
revenue
ruling
to
this
effect
in
1981.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
no,
there
is
not
a
regulation
to
this
effect.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
no.
the
proposed
regulation
to
that
explicitly
addressed
this
particular
issue.
the
revenue
ruling
is
the
only
administrative
guideline--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
the
revenue
ruling
was
issued
in
1981,
and
certainly
since
1981.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
before
that
the
issue
doesn't
appear
to
have
been
firmly
resolved.
there's
absolutely
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
service
had
taken
a
contrary
position.
the
revenue
ruling...
the
fact
of
the
revenue
ruling
indicates
that
perhaps
it
was
intended
to
resolve
the
issue.
but
there
is
no
administrative
document
that
specifically
addresses
the
issue
one
way
or
the
other
before
1981.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's
right.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
the
tax
years
are
1980
and
'81.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
it
should
also
be
pointed
out
that
there
is
no
suggestion
that
this
revenue
ruling
is
addressed
solely
to
this
case.
this
has
been
a
regularly
recurring
pattern
with
social
clubs
and
has
come
up
in
a
number
of
cases.
and
so...
in...
in
some
of
the
other
cases
there
is
completely
different
timing
as
to--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--yes.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
yes,
we
do.
we
accept
that.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
for
what
purpose
do
we
not
accept
it?
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
that--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--no,
we're
not
saying
that
they're...
that
they're
entirely
separate
in
terms
of
the
profit
motive.
we
allow
them
to
offset
their...
the
expenses
up
to
the
level
of
the
last
penny
that
they
get
from
the
sale
of
the
food
and
drinks
to
non-members.
they
don't
have
to
pay
any
tax
at
all
on
that.
but
that
is
not
from
segmenting
the
activity.
that
is
from
a
basic
principle
that's
been
long-established
that
a
taxpayer
can
offset
the
expenses
of
a
not-for-profit
activity.
so,
that's
perfectly
consistent
with
our
view.
our
view
is
in
both
instances
and
the
justification
in
both
instances
is
because
the
activity
is
not
for
profit.
now,
we
do
agree...
we
completely
agree...
that
you
have
to
take
into
account
both
the
direct
costs
and
the
indirect
costs
for
the
purposes
of
evaluating
the
profit
motive.
but
i
don't
see...
respectfully,
i
don't
see
the
inconsistency.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
than
the
combination
of
the
direct
costs--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--and
indirect
costs,
which
is
exactly
the
test
that
justice
o'connor
was
mentioning
that
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
the
north
ridge
case,
which
we
completely
agree
with.
and
that's
why
we're
not
taxing
at
all
their
receipts
from
the
sales--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
it...
it
doesn't
happen
in
the
way
that
they
have
been
allocated
and
so...
it
may
be
that
the
commissioner
is
unduly
generous
in
allowing...
in
stipulating
to
this
allocation
method.
but
all
that
that
goes
to
is
whether
there
should
be
a
tax
imposed
on
the
receipts
from
the
sales
to
the
non-members.
that
doesn't
go
to
whether
somehow
some
special
additional
rule
is
created
that
allows
you
to
offset
the
investment
income
altogether.
that...
that's
an
entirely
separate
issue
here.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
we
have
accepted
this
method
of
allocation,
your
honor,
and
in
the
record...
not
only
for
these
tax
years
in...
not
only
for
the
specific
tax
years
in
question,
but
for
1975
to
1984
there
is
regularly
nothing
but
losses
which
are
shown
by
petitioner
for
this
activity
and
for
this
allocation
method.
so
there's
no
question...
there's
never
been
any
suggestion
here
that
petitioner
intends
to
have
receipts
which
exceed
the
combination
of
the
indirect
costs.
petitioner's
intent
here
is
clear.
it's
to
have
cash
coming
in
in
excess
of
the
direct
costs,
but
not
to
be
in
excess
of
the
direct
costs
and
the
indirect
costs
as
they...
as
they
have
been
allocated
here.
now...
so
when
you
look
at
this
repeated
pattern
and
there's
no
suggestion
that
they
have
any
intention
of
having
a
profit
under
this
standard,
it's
clear
that
they're
engaging
in
it
for
not-for-profit
purposes.
now,
the
question
arises,
and
perhaps
this
is
what
justice
scalia's
question
was
going
to
to
some
extent,
why
then
would
they
do
it?
why
would
an
entity
continue
to
have
losses?
somehow
that
seems
counterintuitive.
and
the
answer
to
that
question
relates
to
the
unique
role
of
social
clubs
in
terms
of
their
dual
uses.
that
they
have...
their
primary
activity
is
a
not-for-profit
activity,
and
then
they
have
this
incidental
other
activity
to
generate
some
cash
in
excess
of
the
direct
costs,
which
will
help
defray
the
costs
of
the--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
it
is...
it
is
not
like
any
business
because
any
business
has
a
profit
motive.
any
business
certainly
has
a...
has
an
incentive
to
maximize
its
off-use
facilities
and
so
on.
but
no
business
in
the
situation
where
it
has
a
not-for-profit
purpose
the
way
that
the
social
club
does
or
tax-exempt
organizations
as
its
primary
purposes.
and
so
it
arises
in
that
context.
really
what
it's
analogous
to
is
not
to
the
situation
of
other
businesses,
which
have
a
profit
motive
for
all
of
their
activities,
but
to
situations...
the
dual-use
cases
in
which
a
taxpayer
has
property
for
a
particular
not-for-profit
purpose,
usually
recreation,
and
the
property
is
something
like
a
yacht
or
a
vacation
house
or
a
horse
or
a
horse
farm
and
on
particular
days
of
the
year
the
taxpayer
seeks
to
rent
out
that
property
and
generate
some
additional
cash
to
help
defray
the
costs
of
the
not-for-profit
purpose.
and
the
courts
have
said
in
that
circumstance
it's
clear
that
in
order
to
look
at
profit
motive
it...
it
is
not
sufficient
to
look
solely
at
the
cash
coming
in
in
excess
of
the
direct
costs,
but
the
whole
picture
has
to
be
considered,
including
proper
allocation
of
the
indirect
costs.
that's
what
distinguishes
the...
the
social
clubs,
this
dual-use
character.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
we
take--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
because
of
the
phrase
"deductions
allowed
by
this
chapter",
justice
white.
the
statute
doesn't...
does
not
suggest
some
kind
of
mechanical
mathematical
formula
in
which
you
just
add
together
the
income
and
then
subtract
the
deductions.
it's
a
specific
requirement.
for
deductions
there
are
two
requirements.
they
have
to
be
directly
connected
to
the
production
of
the
income.
but
they
also
have
to
be
deductions
allowed
by
this
chapter.
and
so
the
very...
the
structure
and
the
text
of
the
statute
points
to
other
provisions
in
chapter
1
for
determining
whether
a
deduction
is
allowed.
and
in
this
case,
petitioner
claims
that
its
deductions
are
allowed
under
section
162
of
the
code.
and
so
one
would
look
to
section
162.
in
section
162,
it
is
clear,
requires
a
profit
motive
for
a
trade
or
business.
now--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--no,
it...
it
doesn't
require
a
trade
or
business
because,
again,
congress,
consciously
broadened--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--the
tax
and
it
includes--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--gross
income--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--which
isn't
limited
to
a
trade
or
business.
but
there
are
obviously
forms
of
income
which
are
not
a
trade
or
business,
and
there's
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
statute
to
suggest
that
congress
meant
somehow
by
broadening
the
scope
of
this
tax
to
say
that
anything
that
fell
within
that
tax
was
automatically
a
trade
or
business
or
to
suggest
that
gross
income--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--there's
no
necessity
to
have
a
trade
or
business
to
be
taxed.
then
if
one
wants
to
claim
a
deduction,
one
has
to
show
that
the...
that
the
deduction
is
authorized
by
a
provision
of
chapter
1
of
the
code.
now,
the
provision
the
petitioner
is
invoking
is
section
162.
to
invoke
that
provision,
one
must
be
a
trade
or
business.
now,
the
fact
that
section
162
generally
requires
a
profit
motive
is
clear.
this
court
has
reiterated
that
point
recently
in
the
groetzinger
and
the
american
bar
endowment
cases,
numerous
courts
of
appeals
decisions
have
held
it.
and
the
fact
that
that
was
the
general
rule
of
section
162
should
be
sufficient
to
address
petitioner's,
claim
because
petitioner
and
other
social
clubs
should
be
fully
applicable
to
that
requirement
because
that
is
the
applicable
provision
under
chapter
1
of
the
code
that
they
are
invoking
for
the
deduction.
the
petitioner
makes
this
plain
meaning
argument
that
because
it...
something...
it
comes
within
the
scope
of
the
tax
it
is
automatically
a
trade
or
business.
and,
as
we've
discussed,
the
tax
and
the
structure
of
the
provision
do
not
support
that
because
they
point
elsewhere
for
the
rules
of
deduction.
they
point
to
the
other
provisions--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that's--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
it...
it
uses
the
term...
chief
justice
rehnquist,
it
uses
the
term
"unrelated
business
taxable
income".
congress
uses
that
term
in
two
very
different
ways.
in
section
512(a)(1)
it
is
using
it
for
almost
all
tax-exempt
organizations,
and
it
refers
only
to
income
from
an
unrelated
trade
or
business.
and
that
term
had
been
in
the
statute
since
the
1950s.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's
right.
and
in
512(a)(3)(a)
in
1969
congress
says,
this
term
that
we've
been
using
in
512(a)(1)
to
refer
only
to
an
unrelated...
income
from
an
unrelated
trade
or
business,
which
is
basically
the
tax
that
we're
imposing
on
non-exempt
income,
it's
going
to
mean
something
entirely
different
for
social
clubs.
it's
going
to...
it's
going
to
have
a
much
broader
scope
and
it's
going
to
refer
to
gross
income
of
all
kinds,
not
only
to
a
trade
or
business.
and...
and
congress
specifically
included
in
that
provision
that
deductions
must
be
allowed
under
chapter
1.
and
so
it
points
to
the
other
provisions
of
chapter
1.
now,
petitioner
claims
to
be
making
a
plain
meaning
argument
based
on
the
fact
that
the
term
"unrelated
business
taxable
income"
is
used
and
even
though
it
had
been
used
in
an
entirely
business
context.
but
petitioner
pulls
back
from
the
reach
of
its
plain
meaning
argument.
in
petitioner's
words,
the
statute
shouldn't
be
read
too
literally,
even
though
it
is
making
a
plain
meaning
argument.
and
petitioner
suggests
this
economic
gain
test
where
if
non-members
pay
a
nominal
fee
for
a
function
in
which
members
participate
and
the
fees
from
the
non-members
do
not
exceed
the
direct
costs
of
providing
that
activity,
then
that
situation
is
not
entitled
to
the
trade
or
business
situation...
to
the
trade
or
business
treatment.
now,
under
petitioner's
plain
meaning
argument
that
clearly
should
be
the
result
because
the
fees
from
the
non-members
are
taxable
income.
they're
gross
income,
they're
not
from
members,
so
they're
unrelated
business
taxable
income.
and,
therefore,
under
petitioner's
view,
they
should
be
automatically
a
trade
or
business
and
entitled
to
very
large
section
162
losses.
but
petitioner
pulls
back
from
the
reach
of
that
because
that
exactly
would
be
clearly
contrary
to
congress'
intent.
the
problem
with
petitioner's
suggestion
of
this
economic
gain
test
is
that
it
is
anchored
nowhere
either
in
the
specific
provision
relating
to
social
clubs
or
in
the
other
provisions
of
chapter
1
to
which
the
social
club
provision
specifically
points.
and
there
is
no
need
to
create
a
new
test
out
of
whole
cloth
in
order
to
address
that
kind
of
situation
because
there
is
a
readily
available
test
that
fully
addresses
that
situation,
and
that
test
is
the
profit
motive
which
other
taxpayers
have
to
meet
under
section
162.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's
correct,
justice
white,
because
there's
no--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
that--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
i
think,
for
example,
the
five
lakes
outing
club
that
is
cited
in
our
brief
at
footnote
6
would
be--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that's
right.
but
part
of
the
reason
for
that,
justice
white,
is
that
there
is
no
provision
or
no
authority
in
the
code
for
taking
losses
from
a
not-for-profit
activity
and
applying
those
to
other
activities.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
it--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--it's...
it
is
a--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--no.
it
is
the
taxpayer's
burden
generally
to
show
that
a
deduction
is
authorized
under
a
particular
provision
and...
and--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--and
that
requirement--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--he
should...
well,
he
doesn't
have
to
pay
tax
on
that
activity.
that's
the
key.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
because
the...
the
reason
that
that
principle
is
allowed
with
respect
to
a
profit-making
activity
is
because
in
that
circumstance
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
that
at
some
point...
the
theory
is
that
at
some
point
the
taxpayer
is
going
to
turn
it
around
and
there's
going
to
be
a
profit
on
it.
maybe
it's
down
the
road,
maybe
it's
very
distant
down
the
road.
but
at
some
point
there's
going
to
be
a
profit
on
the
activity
and
that
that
will
be
taxed
along
with
the
income
from
the
other
activity.
and
that's
one
of
the
justifications
for
allowing
the
loss.
but
when
one
is
engaged
in
a
not-for-profit
activity,
there
is
no
expectation
that
it's
ever
going
to
generate
any
kind
of
a
profit.
and
the
losses
that
are...
that
are
incurred
are
not
deductible.
it's--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's...
that's
exactly
right,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
the
burden
is
on...
is
on
them
and
they
haven't
pointed
to
any
provision
which
would...
which
would
authorize--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that's
right.
that's
right.
but
we--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--not
that
the
deductions
are
proper
as
to
the
non-member
income,
but
the
allocation
of
costs
as
to
the
non-member
income
are
proper.
and
that...
and
then--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
that's...
that's
correct.
all
offsets
of
expenses
up
to
the
level
of
the
last...
it's
not
all
deductions
except
for
the
one
that's
in
question.
it's
a
very
clear
and
logical
principle
that,
to
the
extent
that
their
incurring
expenses
in
getting
this
money
will
allow
them
to
offset
their
expenses
against
that
money,
it's
consistent--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
as...
as
we
had
suggested,
and
as
the
five
lakes
outing
club
suggests,
there
is
a
well-recognized
interpretation
that
the
commissioner
has
given
that
is
consistent
with
the
intent
of
the
code
not
to
tax
gross
income
but
to
tax
net
income,
of
allowing
an
offset
of
expenses
up
to...
up
to
the
level
of
the
receipts.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's
right.
it's
an
offset
of
expenses
that
the
commissioner
permits.
now,
it's
conceivable
that
one
could
argue
that
the
commissioner
is...
is
being
too
generous
in
that
respect.
it
is,
as
the
five
lakes
club
suggests,
a
long-standing
principle
and
judicially
recognized,
as
is
stated
in
their
case.
but
again,
that
goes
to
the
point
about
whether
a
tax
should
have
been
imposed
on
the
sale
of
food
and
drinks
to
non-members,
whether
that
offset
should
have
been
disallowed
altogether.
and
it
suggests
that
perhaps
the
commissioner,
if
anything,
was
being
too
generous
in
that
respect.
but
that
does
not
allow
and
that
is
no
justification
for
creating
a
special
rule
that
allows
the
offset
of
the
investment
income.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
but
i...
respectfully,
i
think
that
our
position
is
entirely
consistent
here
because
what
we
are
allowing...
and
it
is...
has
been
applied
in
numerous
other
situations...
is
an
offset
of
expenses
up
to
the
level
of
the
receipts.
we're
saying,
okay,
we're
not
going
to
tax
you
up
to...
up
to
that
level.
but
we're
not
going
to
take
the
further
step
of
allowing
you
to
use
claimed
losses
in
order
to
offset
other
income
and
eliminate...
and
eliminate
tax
on
that
other
income.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
it--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--i...
let
me
answer
it
in
this
way,
justice
o'connor.
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
long-standing
interpretation
of
an
offset
of
expenses,
and
we're
not
suggesting--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
but
there
is
absolutely
no
suggestion
that
the
commissioner
intends
to
take
that
position
or
has
taken
that
position.
and
it's
precisely
because
of
a
concern
about
taxing
gross
income
as
opposed
to
net
income
in
the
circumstance.
so
it's
important
to
realize
that
petitioner's
arguments,
either
its
primary
argument
that
it
should
be
excused
from
the
generally
applicable
profit
motive
requirement,
or
its
argument
that
it
should
be
able
to
claim
that
certain
expenses
are
directly
connected
for
the
purpose
of
claiming
a
deduction
and
then
say
that
they're
not
related
at
all
for
the
purpose
of
evaluating
their
profit
motive,
would
go...
would
clearly
be
contrary
to
congress'
legislative
purpose
and
go
a
long
way
toward
nullifying
the
tax
on
investment
income
that
congress
thought
it
was
imposing
in
1969.
it
is
relatively
easy
and
common
for
social
clubs
to
structure
their
sales
to
non-members
in
exactly
the
way
the
petitioner
has
here
and
to
eliminate
any
tax
on
their
investment
income.
now,
if
the
text
of
the
statute
required
this
result,
it
might
be
an
example
of
an
unintended
tax
loophole
by
congress.
but
far
from
compelling
that
result,
the
text
of
the
statute
points
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction
and
in
the
direction
entirely
consistent
with
the
purpose
that
congress
explicitly
stated
in
passing
the
provision
in
1969.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
that's
correct.
that...
that
is
correct.
that
was
exactly
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
in
1969.
it's
explicit
under
the
statute
that
investment
income
that
is
not
included
in
the
taxable
income
of
a
tax-exempt
organization
and
is
included
for
a
social
club.
that...
that's
explicit
under
the
statute
and
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
that
certainly
is
the
primary
distinction
and
it's
one
that
congress
was
focusing
on
in
1969.
congress,
by
using
the
words
gross
income,
included
all
forms
of
income--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--except
for
the
exempt
function
income.
but
that
is
the
principal
difference.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
there...
there
wouldn't
be--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--and
as
recent--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--we
stipulated
to
it
in
this
case
that
those
indirect
costs
were
properly
allocated
and
that
they
were
directly
connected.
now,
as
we
suggest
in
footnote
24
of
our
brief,
there
may
be
room
to
question
that
and...
but
we
are
not
in
a
position
in
this
case,
having
stipulated--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--to
it
to--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--well,
if...
as
applied
to
social
clubs
across
the
country,
we
would
be
out
a
lot
of
money
and
we
would
be
in
a
situation
where--
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
--oh,
i
see.
if
you
change
the
allocation
method.
mr.
clifford
m.
sloan
well,
if
you
change
the
allocation
method
and,
for
example,
didn't
allow
any
costs
to
be
allocated
altogether,
then
that...
that
suggests
that
petitioner
should
have
been
taxed
on
that
income.
