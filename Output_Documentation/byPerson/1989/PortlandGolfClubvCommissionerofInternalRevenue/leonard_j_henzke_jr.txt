mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
the
issue
in
this
case
involves
the
deductibility
of
the
unrelated
non-member
business
expenses
of
an
exempt
social
club.
specifically,
whether
the
government
is
correct
that
there
is
a
per
se
rule
requiring
an
exempt
social
club
to
intend
to
report
a
tax
profit
on
its
tax
return
in
order
to
deduct
a
loss
on
such
business.
here,
petitioner
is
a
tax-exempt
social
club.
it
is
a
golf
club.
it
has
operated
one
of
the
finest
golf
courses
in
oregon
for
the
past
75
years.
in
addition
to
its
golf
course,
it
operates
a
food
and
beverage
business
for
members
and
also
for
non-members
whose
private
parties
are
sponsored
by
members.
virtually
all
the
private
party
business
is
categorized
as
an
unrelated
business
by
section
512(a)(3)
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
in
the
years
at
issue,
this
food
and
beverage
unrelated
business
produced
tax
losses
when...
when
computed
according
to
a
method
stipulated
by
the
government
to
be
reasonable.
these
losses
were
used
to
offset
other
unrelated
business
income...
unrelated
business
income
from
another
activity,
the
investment
income.
the
government
disallowed
the
deduction
which
produced
the
losses
on
the
basis
that
the
food
and
beverage
unrelated
activity
was
not
entered
into
with
an
intent
to
earn
a
profit.
we
contend
that
no
profit
motive
is
required
because
the
plain
and
ordinary
meaning
of
the
terms
in
section
512(a)(3)
do
not
require
a
profit
motive.
the
resolution
of
this
case,
in
our
view,
depends
completely
on
the
terms
of
section
512(a)(3).
accordingly,
i
would
like
to
take
a
few
minutes
to
analyze
the
operation
of
this
statute.
section
512(a)(3)
of
the
code
divides
the
activities
of
a
social
club
into
two
parts,
and
for
our
convenience
today
i
would
like
to
call
these
parts
categories
or
baskets.
section
512(a)(3)
creates
two
categories
for
the
activities
of
an
exemption...
social
club
called
the
exempt
category
and
the
unrelated
business
category.
section
512(a)(3)
then
defines
which
club
activities
are
to
go
into
each
category.
section
512(a)(3)(b)
narrowly
defines
the
exempt
category
to
consist
of
those
activities
which
are
member-paid
social
or
recreational
goods
or
services.
goods
or
services
that
the
members
pay
for;
that's
the
exempt
category.
on
the
other
hand,
section
512(a)(3)(a)
provides
that
all
the
remaining
activities--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--the
section
512(a)(3)?
well,
it's
in
the--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--appendix
to
the--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--yes.
no,
the
appendix
to
the
brief.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
yes.
at
pages
a-1,
a-2
and
a-3.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
the
blue
brief,
yes.
at
the
very
end.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
as
i
was
saying,
section
512(a)(3)(a)
defines
all
the
remaining
activities,
all
the
activities
except
the
exempt
category,
as
fitting
into
the
unrelated
business
category.
the
tax
treatment
of
the
income
and
deductions
of
an
activity
is
determined
by
which
category
section
512(a)(3)
assigns
that
particular
category.
the
income
of
an
exempt
category
is
exempt,
and
the
deductions...
and
the
expenses
are
not
deductible.
the
income
of
the
unrelated
business
activity
is
taxable
and
the
deduction...
and
the
expenses
are
deductible
if
those
expenses
are
of
the
type
allowed
to
a
business
by
chapter
1
of
the
code.
now,
the
government
maintains
that
after
section
512(a)(3)
assigned
petitioner's
unrelated
food
and
beverage
business
to
the
unrelated
business
category
it
must
then
meet
a
profit
motive
test
under
section
162
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
however,
the
profit
motive
test
is
generally
a
precondition
to
the
existence
of
a
business.
the
existence
of
a
business
is
a
requirement
for
section
162
to
apply.
in
this
respect,
the
profit
motive
test
is
similar
with
respect
to
section
162
as
the
rules
of
section
512(a)(3)
are
with
respect
to
that
statute,
where
the
rules
of
section
512(a)(3)
establish
the
preconditions
for
determining
whether
an
activity
is
an
unrelated
business.
once
the
section
512(a)(3)
precondition
for
an
unrelated
business
are
met,
it
would
be
contradictory
to
attempt
to
apply
the
profit
motive
precondition
for
a
section
162
business.
the
government's
interpretation--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--well,
profit
motive
is
simply
irrelevant
for
a...
to
determine
whether
an
activity
goes
on
the
unrelated
business
side...
category
under
section
512(a)(3)
because
section
512(a)(3)
does
not
contain
any
profit
motive
requirement
and
it
sets
forth
specifically
what
the
requirements
are
for
being
an
unrelated
business
under
section
512(a)(3).
and
since
there
is
no
profit
motive
requirement
in
section
512(a)(3)
of
the
code,
then
profit
motive
is
really
basically
irrelevant.
now,
you
could
have
a
situation
where
if
the
club
was,
for
example,
providing
food
and
beverages
to
non-members
who
were,
for
example,
maybe
their
friends
and
they
were
providing
them,
say,
at
half
cost,
that
in
actuality
what
they're
doing
is
they're
really
having
the
members
pay
part
of
the
cost
for
these
nominally
non-member
functions.
so
it
may
be
then
what
would
nominally
be
an
unrelated
business
under
section
512(a)(3)...
in
other
words,
you
would
say,
first
of
all,
if
you
looked
at
it,
well,
this
looks
like
a
non-member
function.
it's
really
a
member
function.
but
once
you
determine
that
it
is
a...
an
unrelated
business
activity,
then
it
does
not
need
a
profit
motive.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
your
honor,
it
does
incorporate
many
requirements
of
provisions
other
than
section
512(a)(3).
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
and
we
agreed
with
that...
with
that
contention.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
i
would...
i
don't
think
it's
been
interpreted
as
incorporating
a
profit
motive
in
the--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--for
a...
it
incorporates
a
trade
or
business.
but
the
profit
motive
test
is
a
precondition
to
determine
if
a
section
162
business
exists.
now,
once
you
have
a
section
162
business,
then
there
are
other
requirements
of
section
162
which
you...
which
you
must
apply.
for
example,
the
necessary
test
or
the
ordinary
test.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
business,
it
doesn't
mean
every
single
deduction
is
going
to
be
deductible.
a
particular
expense
may
be
a
non-ordinary
expenses,
that
is,
a
capital
item.
so
it
would
not
be
deductible.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
because
section
512(a)(3)
itself
decides
what
is
a
business
and--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--you've
got
a
business,
right.
now,
even
in
our
case,
once
you
have
a
business
some
of
the
items
of
deduction
in
that
business
may
be
non...
items
of
expense,
rather,
in
that
business
may
be
non-deductible.
for
example,
if
you
have
a
capital
expenditure,
it...
then
it's
non-deductible
because
it
does
not
meet
the
ordinary
test
of
section
162.
or
you
may
have,
for
example,
a
lavish
expense
which
then
does
not
meet
the
necessary
test
of
section
162.
but
you...
you...
section
512(a)(3)
sets
forth
the
preconditions
for
determining
whether
a
business
exists,
an
unrelated
business
exists,
under
section
512(a)(3).
you
then,
after
you
have
that
precondition...
set
of
preconditions...
you
can't
go
to
section
162
and
say,
well,
let's
test
this
again
to
see
if
the
preconditions,
the
profit
motive
test,
of
section
162
will
apply
here,
because
what
you're
going
to
have
then
is
a
contradiction.
you
can't
have
two
sets
of
preconditioning...
preconditions
governing
one
particular
category
or
activity.
it
has
to
be--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--be
one
or
the
other.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
well,
i--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--i
think
the...
the
government's...
the
government
confuses
the
preconditions
for
a
section
162
business
with
what
happens
after
it's
determined
you
have
a
business.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
that's
right.
i
don't
think
the
government
would
disagree
with
that.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
nor
does
the
government
disagree
that
we
properly
computed
the
direct
and
the
indirect
expenses.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
that's
right.
and...
and
the
government,
i
think,
would
contend
that
the
deductions
that
make
up
that
loss...
because
it
is
a
loss...
become
non-deductible
because
it's
not
for
profit.
and
our
contention
is,
no,
they...
they're
business
because
section
512(a)(3)
says
these
are
business
activities.
and
you
can't...
after
you
make
that
determination
under
section
512(a)(3)
you
then
can't
go
to
section
162
and
say,
well,
let's
see
what
preconditions
are
necessary
to
see
what
a
business...
whether
a
business
exists
under
section
162.
in
our
view,
the
government
is
confusing
the
precondition
for
section
162,
namely,
the
profit
motive,
with
the
requirements
of
section
162,
which
are
the
ordinary,
the
necessary,
the
paid
or
incurred
and
other
requirements
in
the
statute.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
not
in...
not
in
this
particular
case.
in
some
cases,
of
course,
the
club
would
have
taxable
income
on
the
return
and,
therefore,
it
would
be
a
trade
or
business
under
the
162
precondition.
but,
of
course,
there
is
no...
for...
there's
no
profit
motive
precondition
in
section
162
of
the
code.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
if
we
had
made
money
in
the
sense
that
we
had
taxable
income--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--we
would
then
have
to
pay
tax
on
that
taxable
income.
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
well,
i...
whether
or
not
we
had
a
profit
motive,
right.
if
we
accidentally
made
money,
even
though
we
didn't
have
a
profit
motive,
i
suppose
that
could
happen
in
a
social
club.
yes,
we
would
have
to
pay
taxes
because
that
is
an
absolute
rule
of
section
512(a)(3),
that
you
have
to...
it's
taxable
income;
you
have
to
pay
tax
on
it.
maybe
an
illustration
would
help
clear
up
this
difference
between
the
preconditions
of
section
162
and
the
requirements
of
section
162.
the
preconditions
aren't
incorporated
into
section
512(a)(3);
the
requirements
are.
in
our
view,
under
the...
what
the
government
is
doing,
it's
applying
the
profit
motive
test
to
the
items
of
expense
that
are
in
the
unrelated
business
activity
on
an
item-by-item
basis.
for
example,
under
the
government's
test,
they
would
take
the
appetizer,
the
food
that
goes
into
the
appetizer
at
a
non-member
banquet,
unrelated
function
and
they
would
say,
we
are
going
to
apply
the
profit
motive
test
to
the
cost
of
the
food,
the
expense
for
the
food
in
that
appetizer.
well,
obviously,
that
can't
be
done.
i
mean,
you
can't
have
a
profit
motive
with
respect
to
an
item
of
expense.
you
can't
say
that
the
appetizer
food
is...
has
a
profit
motive,
or
doesn't
have
a
profit
motive
and
the
dessert,
the
food
that
goes
into
the
dessert,
does
have--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--a
profit
motive.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
well,
that's
what
they're
doing,
i
think,
your
honor,
because
they
are
saying
that
after--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--but,
your
honor,
i
think
that
what
they're
saying
is
that
we
will...
we
agree
that
this
is
an
unrelated
business
under
section
512(a)(3)
of
the
code.
but
we
are
now
going
to
examine...
we're
going
to
apply
the
test
under
section
162.
and
the
test
under
162,
for
example,
is...
is
whether
it's
a
necessary
expense.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
well,
the
gross--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--of
course,
you
don't
include
the
gross
income
just
as
gross
income.
you
have
to
take
the...
deductions
from
the
gross
income
and
then
you
get
net
unrelated
business
taxable
income,
or
unrelated
business
taxable
income.
so,
the
statute
is
defining
unrelated
business
taxable
income,
and
then
you
have
to
determine
what
is
the
gross
income
and
what
are
the
expenses
and
then
you
come
up
with
what
the
taxable
income
is.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
well,--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--well,
there
is...
there
is
a
great
deal
of
control.
we
would
apply
the
ordinary
test.
in
other
words,
it
can't
be
a
capital
item.
even
if
it's
in...
the
item,
the
expense,
is
in
the
unrelated
business
activity.
it's
been
classified.
it's
been
put
in
the
unrelated
business
basket.
but
still,
it
has
to...
it
will
not
be
deductible
if
it
doesn't
pass
the
ordinary
test,
the
necessary
test,
the
paid
or
incurred
test,
the
incurred...
paid
or
incurred
in
a
taxable
year
test,
the
substantiation
test...
all
the
other
requirements
of
a
section
162
trade
or
business.
but
we
do
make
one
exception.
we
say,
but
we
don't
have
to
meet
the
preconditions
for
a
business
under
section
162
because
the
preconditions
for
an
unrelated
business
under
section
512(a)(3)
is
in
section
512(a)(3)
and
you
can't
apply
two
different
preconditions
for
a
business.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
oh,
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
there's
no
dispute
here
that
we
properly
allocated
the
fixed
costs
to
the
unrelated
business
income.
it's
stipulated
that
the
method
we
used--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--it's
stipulated
in
this
case
that
this
was
a
reasonable
allocation.
but
the
allocation
method
that
was
used
is
the
gross-to-gross
method,
the
gross-to-gross
allocation
method.
and
that
is
the
normal
allocation
method
made
by...
under
section
512(a)(3)
and
actually
by
most
exempt
organizations
under
section
512(a)(1)
also.
that...
that
allocation
method
has
been
approved
by
the
claims
court
in
the
disabled
american
veterans
case.
i
think
a
comparison
of
section
512(a)(1)
and
section
512(a)(3)
confirms
our
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
in...
in
our
view,
your
honor,
the
statute
does
not
tax
gross
investment
income.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
undisputed
in
this
case
that
the
tax...
that
the
section
512(a)(3)
taxes
gross
investment
income
less
expenses
and
gross
unrelated
business
food
and
beverage
income
less
the
related
expenses.
now,
the
entertainment...
talking
about...
taking
entertainment
costs
and
deducting
them
from
the
investment
income,
in
actuality
the
entertainment-type
expenses
are
covered
by
the
categorization,
the
division
process,
in
section
512(a)(3),
because
you
see,
the
member
expenses
are
actually
a
type
of
quasi-personal
expense.
and
that
is
why
congress
placed
them
in
this
exempt
category.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
section
512(a)(3)
of
the
code,
you'll
see
that
congress
did
not
want
those
expenses
to
be
offset
against
the
investment
income
so
they...
they
provided
specific
rules
to
make
sure
that
those
losses
on
the
member
business
were
not
offset
against
the
investment
income.
that
was
the
thrust
of
section
512(a)(3).
and
of
course,
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
none
of
the
member
expenses...
the
member
losses
in
our
case...
are
being
offset
against
the
investment
income.
now,
why
didn't
congress
go
further
and
say
that,
well,
you
may
have
some...
some
expenses
that
we
didn't
catch
in
this
division
category
that
are
being
offset
against
the
investment
income
and
might
be
said
to
be
somewhat
member
related?
why
didn't
they
go
further?
well,
i
think
the...
the
practical
reason
is
that
in
1969
tax-exempt
social
clubs
were
only
allowed
to
have
5
percent
of
their
total
gross
receipt
represented
by
all
active
non-member
income,
including
non-member
food
and
beverage
income.
so
that
it
really
was
not
a...
a
major
problem
in
section...
in
1969,
the
thought
that
maybe
there
would
be
some
losses
on
the
non-member
side
and
they
would
be
offset
against
the...
the
investment
income.
so
congress
certainly...
there
was
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
they
thought
that
losses
on
unrelated
business...
food
and
beverage
business...
should
not
offset
the
investment
income.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
all
right.
assume,
then,
that
the...
for
simplicity,
that
you
had
one
dollar
of
non-member
income
and
$99
of
member
income
in
that
situation.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
all
right.
and
the
fixed
expenses
of
the
club
were...
that...
that
would
be
your
gross
receipts.
the
fixed
expenses
of
the
club
were
$1,000.
so,
under
that,
then
99
percent
of
the
fixed
expenses
would
go...
would
be
allocated
to
the
non-member
business
and
1
percent
of
the
expenses
would
be
allocated
to
the
member
business.
now,
you
have
to
realize
it
will
never
be
more
than
15
percent
because
there's
a
15
percent
limit
now
under
the
current
code.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
on
the
non-member
business,
yes.
right.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
well,
it
really--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--well,
the
reason--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--there
is
a
reason
for
using
this
gross-to-gross
method
even
if
it's
not
perfectly
accurate.
and
that's
the
fact
that
there
are
50,000
social
clubs...
tax-exempt
social
clubs...
in
the
country.
most
of
them
are
very
small,
and
if
you
used
a
more
complicated
method,
like
the
actual-use
method
here,
under
which
we
actually
had
a
profit...
net
income
of
$45,000...
if
you
used
that
method,
you
would...
of
course,
it
would
be
too
complex
to...
to--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--well,
they're
under...
some
of
them
may
be...
the
gross-to-gross
method
may
be
accurate.
some
it
may
overstate;
some
it
may
understate.
it
just
depends.
the
more
non-member
business
you
have,
the
greater
will
be
your
fixed
expense
deductions.
the
less
non-member
business
you
have,
the
less.
i
mean,
if
you
have
1
percent
non-member
business,
then
you
have
one
percent
allocation.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
right.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
that's...
that's
correct.
yes.
that's
correct.
but
not
initiation
fees.
not
initiation
fees.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
that...
that
will
vary.
if
the...
if
the
member
pays
the
bill,
generally
that
is...
that
is
a
member
expense
or...
and
member
income
to
the
club.
if
the
non-member
pays
the
bill,
in
general,
that
is
an
unrelated
business,
a
non-member
item
of
income.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
well,
the
mechanics
of
it
will
differ,
but
the
non-member
can
bear
the
economic...
burden
of
the
bill,
yes.
yes.
if
he's
sponsored
by
a
member.
i'd
just...
i'd
like
to
take
a
couple
of
minutes
to
talk
about
our
alternative
argument
that
petitioner
had
a
profit
motive.
the
unanimous
tax
court
in
the
north
ridge
country
club
opinion
applied
here,
assumed
that
section
512(a)(3)
required
a
profit
motive,
and
the
court
found
that
both
clubs
had
a
profit
motive
based
on
all
the
facts
and
circumstances.
i
don't
have
time
to
go
through
all
those
facts
and
circumstances,
but
i
think
that
significant
here
is
that
the
gross
receipt
here
exceeded
the
variable
cost
by
$50,000
in
the
two
years
in
issue,
and
that
they...
under
the
actual
use
method,
which
took
into
account
the
fixed
expenses,
we
had
a
profit
here
of
$45,000
in
two
years.
so
we
submit
that
the
government
is
wrong
in
saying
that
taxable
income
is
a
per
se
requirement
for
having
a
profit
motive.
with
this
kind
of
real
economic
profit,
we
submit
that
we
had
a
profit
motive
even
if
you
determine
under
section
512(a)(3)
that
a
profit
motive
is
required.
and
we
think
that
the
tax
court
rationale
for
making
that
determination
on
a
facts
and
circumstances
basis
is
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
the...
in
the
groetzinger
case.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
well,
because
the
definition
of...
of
profit,
for
purposes
of
computing
your
tax,
is
different
from
the
definition
of
profit
for
purposes
of
profit--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--motive.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
it's
cash
flow,
right.
or
cash
return,
as
some
of
the
commentators
in
some
of
the
opinions
have
called
it.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
first
address
the
question
of
whether
the...
the
government
is
correct
in
stating
that
since
the
burden
of
proof
is
on
us,
then
the
burden
is
on
us
to
somehow
come
up
with
some
specific
provision
in
the
regulations
or
something
which
allows
us
to
take
this
deduction.
i
think
that
the
government's
contention
confuses
what
is
a
factual
burden...
a
burden
of
factual...
burden
of
proof
is
on
us.
but
we
contend
that
the
plain
ordinary
meaning
of
section
512(a)(3)
allows
us
to
take
these
deductions
because
it
says
that
all...
everything
that's
not
exempt
function
income
and
deduction
is
to
be
put
in
this
other
basket,
the
unrelated
basket.
and
once
you
get
the
unrelated
basket,
all
the
items
of
income
and...
income
and
deduction
are
to
be
aggregated.
and--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
there
is...
there
is
no
general
rule
of
that
kind,
any
kind
whatsoever,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
but...
but
the
tax
court
and
the
sixth
circuit
said
that
the
proposed
regulations,
which
were
in
effect
until
1986,
specifically
authorized
the
aggregation--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--well,
it
was...
it
was
outstanding.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
that
is
incorrect,
your
honor.
prior
to
1981,
routinely
deductions...
losses
on
food
and
beverage
income
were
offset
against
investment
income.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
well,
in
this...
in
this
particular
case
it
was
done
routinely
until
revenue
ruling
81-69
was...
was
promulgated.
and
certainly
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
tax...
tax
court
both
stated
that
the
proposed
regulation,
which
was
outstanding
then,
allowed
this
kind
of
offset.
and
the...
as
we've
said
in
our
brief,
the
government's
own
manual
for
instruction
of...
of
revenue
agents
continually
cited
proposed...
those
proposed
regulations
as
being
the
proper
way
to
interpret
the
code
from
1969
through
1981.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
the
government's
manual,
which
is...
is
produced
by
the
national
office
of
the
internal
revenue.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
that
is
available.
yes,
your
honor.
it's
a
public
document.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
your
honor
in...
in
section
512(a)(1)
the...
the
situation
is
sort
of
reversed.
everything
is
exempt
unless...
unless
the
statute
specifically
says
it
is
non-exempt
and
non-deductible.
so,
in
section...
in
section
512(a)(1)
you
have
to
show--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--that
it's
a
trade
or
business.
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
they
would...
they
would
not
allow
the
loss
to
be
taken
if
there
was
not
a
profit
motive,
because
under
section
512(a)(1)
the--
mr.
leonard
j.
henzke,
jr.
--i
don't
think
there
has
been
any
case
or
any
authority
which
has
addressed
that
point,
your
honor,
up
to
this
point.
