so
are
you...
are
you
saying
that
there's
a
presumption
in...
in
this
section
of
the
statute
that
any
deduction
is
for
a
profit
motive
and
that
any
unrelated
business
is
also
for
a
profit
motive,
or
that
profit
motive
is
simply
irrelevant?
justice
kennedy
--but
you
seem
to
be
interpreting
this
section
as
saying
that
anything
goes
so
far
as
the
deduction
of
the
related
expenses
so
long
as
it's
related.
justice
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
there
has
to
be
some
control,
as
justice
o'connor
points
out,
initially
under
section
162.
justice
kennedy
well,
you
have
to
allocate
some
fixed
costs
to
the
unrelated
income,
don't
you?
justice
kennedy
was
that
stipulated
for
purposes
of
this
case
or
is
there
a
revenue
ruling
that
covers
this
area
generally?
or
was
it
just
stipulated
in
this
case
that
that's
a
proper
allocation?
justice
kennedy
and
the
government
has
stipulated
that
that's
an
appropriate
allocation
in
this
case?
justice
kennedy
that...
that
seems
to
me
very
strange.
they've
done
it,
so
i
suppose
we're
stuck
with
it.
it
just--
justice
kennedy
--doesn't
seem
to
me
that
one...
that
one
member
uses
one
percent
of
the
fixed
costs.
that's
just
contrary
to
common
sense,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
kennedy
but
that
seems
to
be
what
the
government
seems
to
have
done.
justice
kennedy
so
all
of
the
clubs
in
the
country
are,
therefore,
understating...
or,
overstating
the
costs
that
are
allocated
to
non-member
activity?
justice
kennedy
well...
well,
but
i...
i
wonder
if
there
isn't
an
inconsistency
there.
once
you
allow
them
to
allocate
in
this
way,
isn't
that
a
concession
by
the
revenue
that
this
is
either
a
profit
or
a
loss,
depending
on
how
it
comes
out.
you've
accepted
this...
this
method
of
allocation.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
don't
know
why
that's...
why
that's
confined
to
social
clubs.
any
business
does
that.
justice
kennedy
except
that
you
come...
you
come
here
having
stipulated
that
the
deductions
are
proper
as
to
the
non-member
income.
that's
right.
justice
kennedy
well,
all
deductions
other
than
the
one
in
question.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
they'd
say
it's
a
matter
of
consistency,
not
generosity.
