justice
stevens
well,
they
don't
refer
to--
justice
stevens
--they
don't
really
say
that,
do
they?
justice
stevens
well,
it
is
certainly
logical
to
say
that
running
the
restaurant
and
all
the
other
non-member
activities
is
one
major
function
of
the
club
and
the
interest
on
their
investments
is
another
one.
you
don't
have
to
divide
it
into
salad
and
appetizers
and
shrimp
cocktails,
do
you?
[laughter]
justice
stevens
they're
doing
it
for
purposes
of
deductions,
not
for
purposes
of
including
the
gross
income.
justice
stevens
to
the
extent
you'd
include--
justice
stevens
mr.
sloan,
will
you
just
clear
up
one
thing
to
be
sure
i
have
it
straight?
if
the
old
fashioned
definition
of
unrelated
business
taxable
income
had
not
been...
if
that
term
had
not
been
specially
defined...
redefined
for
clubs,
is
it
correct
that
the
interest
income
would
not
have
been
taxable
because
the
interest
income
in
itself
would
not
have
been
an
unrelated
business
income?
justice
stevens
and
that's
really
the
big
distinction
between
the
two
definitions
of
unrelated
business
taxable
income.
one
includes
interest
and
the
other
doesn't.
justice
stevens
yeah.
