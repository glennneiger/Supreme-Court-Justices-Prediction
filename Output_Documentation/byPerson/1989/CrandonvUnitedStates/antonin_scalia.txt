justice
scalia
mr.
lacovara,
the
first
paragraph
doesn't
say...
it
doesn't
say
receives
as
an
officer
or
employee.
it
says
receives
a
salary,
contribution
to,
supplementation
of
salary,
as
compensation
for
his
services
as
an
officer
or
an
employee.
you
can
receive
it
as
compensation
for
your
services
as
an
officer
or
an
employee
whether
or
not
you
are
now
an
officer
or
an
employee.
justice
scalia
in
the
first
paragraph.
justice
scalia
now,
i
think
you
are
stronger
on
the
second
paragraph.
justice
scalia
mr.
sharp,
can
i
return
to
justice
stevens'
question?
what
do
you
take
to
be
the
subjective
intent
that
is
required
by
the
phrase
"as
compensation
for
his
services"?
specifically,
does
there
have
to
be
an
exchange,
does
there
have
to
be
a
quid
pro
quo?
is
it...
is
it
rather
like
consideration
in
the
law
of
contracts?
justice
scalia
well,
what
does
to
compensate
mean?
i
mean,
suppose
somebody
comes
up
to
me
after
i
have
retired
from
government
service
and
they
say
scalia,
we
really
admire
you,
you
have
done
a
great
job
for
your
country.
we
want
to
give
you
an
award
of
$50,000
for
outstanding
public
service.
i
am
sure
a
lot
of
people
get
awards
like
that.
is
that
compensation
for...
for
public
service?
justice
scalia
why
not?
justice
scalia
there
is
nothing
in
here
about
that.
this
is
a
prophylactic
rule.
you
don't
have
to
examine
case
by
case
to
see
if
there
is
a
potential
for
conflict
of
interest,
it
is
obviously
prophylactic.
but
why
is...
in
your
mind
that
one
is
not
covered.
now,
i
could
explain
why
that
is
not
covered,
i
could
say
there
is
really
no
quid
pro
quo.
it
is
not
if
you
go
into
the
government,
i'll
pay
you
this
amount
of
money.
and
therefore
i
could
say
it
is
not
compensation
for
your
being
in
the
government.
that
way
i
could
understand
your
arguing
an
intent
requirement.
but
i
don't
understand
what
kind
of
intent
requirement
you
are
arguing.
you
say
it
has
to
be
intent
to
give
it
to
him
as
compensation.
well,
that
sounds
very
nice,
but
what
does
"as
compensation"
mean
if
it
doesn't
mean
quid
pro
quo?
you
work
for
the
government,
and
i
will
pay
you
the
money.
justice
scalia
oh,
i
know
that.
i
know
that.
but
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean
by
"as
compensation".
there
has
to
be
a
subjective
intent
to
give
it
to
you
as
compensation.
but,
but
it
doesn't
cover
the
situation
where
i
say
you
have
done
a
wonderful
job
for
your
country;
in
admiration
of
your
work
for
your
country
i
am
giving
you
$50,000.
that...
that
isn't
covered.
justice
scalia
well,
every
prophylactic
rule
is
over
broad,
i
mean,
and--
justice
scalia
i
understand
that.
justice
scalia
well,
but
the
first...
the
first
is
at
least
ambiguous,
and
the
second
doesn't
seem
to
be
ambiguous,
because
it
says
whoever
pays
or
makes
any
contribution
to
or
in
any
way
supplements
the
salary
of
any
such
officer
or
employee.
justice
scalia
fine.
justice
scalia
but
congress,
nonetheless,
felt
it
necessary
in
the
sections
dealing
with
bribery
to
say
explicitly
that
it
covered
payments
made
before
you
were
actually
in
service.
justice
scalia
it
says
it,
very
explicitly.
why
doesn't
it
say
it
explicitly
here?
justice
scalia
you
think
it
is
that
clear?
justice
scalia
the
language
is
that
clear.
justice
scalia
it
is
not
a
contractual
relationship
though.
there
is
a
lot
of
law
to
that
effect,
and
it
seems
to
me,
and
this
sort
of
gets
back
to
what
the
chief
justice
was
suggesting,
mr.
kneedler,
it
seems
to
me,
are
you
really
arguing
that
this
has
anything
to
do
with
the
old
common
law
cases
dealing
with
fiduciary
obligations?
because
i
don't
think
this
statute
reflects
a
fiduciary
obligation.
it
goes
well
beyond
fiduciary
obligations
to
enact
a
prophylactic
rule.
you're
essentially
arguing
that
any
federal
statute
that
forbids
an
act
by
a
federal
employee
brings
along
with
it
a
cause
of
action
by
the
government
if
that
prohibition
is
violated.
so,
if
it
was
a
statute
that
no
federal
employee
shall
get
his
hair
cut,
you
would
be
able
to
sue
the
barber
that
gave
him
a
hair
cut
for
the
money
that
he
paid
the
barber.
justice
scalia
well,
why
is
it?
why?
justice
scalia
so
you
assert
that
there
is
a...
that
a
private
employer,
let's
assume
boeing
found
out
that
somebody
was
leaving
boeing
to
go
to
another
private
employer,
presumably
not
in
aerospace,
or
they
wouldn't
make
the
payment,
but
they
say,
you
know,
this
is
a
good
job
he
is
going
to,
but
it
is
not
paying
very
much.
he
has
been
a
good
employee,
let's
give
him
a
good,
high
severance
payment
in
light
of
the
low
salary
he
will
be
getting
for
this
private
company.
you
say
that
private
company
would
have
a
cause
of
action
at
common
law?
justice
scalia
he
would?
justice
scalia
i
think
that
is
the
position
you
are
driven
to.
you
are
really
driven
to
say
that
is
i
give
you
a
high
severance
payment
because
you
are
going
to
take
a
low-paying
job
with
another
private
employer,
that
private
employer
can
sue
me
and
can
sue
the
person
that
i
make
the
payment
for.
justice
scalia
no,
you
say,
you
said
this
is
common
law.
you
said
it
is
the
common
law
principle
of
fiduciary
obligation.
justice
scalia
oh
yes,
at
least,
but
is
that
required?
justice
scalia
the
quid
pro
quo?
no,
it
isn't
clear
at
all.
justice
scalia
well,
and
when
i
get
an
award
of
$10,000
for
having
been
a
wonderful
whatever
it
is
for
the
federal
government,
after
i
have
left
federal
government
service,
it's
also
clear
that
the
reason
they
are
giving
me
the
$10,000
is
the
work
i
did
for
the
government.
it
is
just
as
clear.
and
yet
you
say
the
justice
department
takes
the
position
that
that
is
not
covered.
justice
scalia
how
can
you
reconcile
the
two?
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
scalia
what
if
they
give
me
the
$10,000
in
a
lump
sum
before
i
go
into
the
government.
they
say
scalia,
we
know
you
are
going
to
do
a
great
job
for
the
government.
here
is
a
$10,000
award
in
advance.
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
compensation
is
compensation,
whether
it
is
given
before
or
whether
it
is
given
afterwards--
justice
scalia
--unless,
unless
you
import
a
requirement
of
consideration,
of
quid
pro
quo.
i'll
give
you
the
money
if
you
do
the
work.
now,
if
you
are
willing
to
import
that,
i
think
you
have
a
lot
more
to
prove
in
this
case.
justice
scalia
was
that
done
at
the
same
time?
justice
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
could
you
provide
us
with
a
citation
to
the
justice
department
position
that
says
that
a
government
employee,
after
leaving
government
employment,
can
receive
an
award,
or
even
during
government
employment--
justice
scalia
--based
upon
his
government
service.
justice
scalia
thank
you.
