mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
209
required
some
proof
of
subjective
intent
on
the
part
of
the
parties.
in
fact,
the
court
of
appeals
expressly
found,
or
expressly
rejected,
the
government's
assertion
that
the
statute
could
be
violated
with
simply
a
showing
of
objective
intent,
or
without
any
intent
at
all.
the
construction
that
the
courts
below
gave
that,
the
statute,
we
think
is
compelled,
because
otherwise
the
statute
would
proscribe
all
manner
of
payment,
including
severance
payments
to
which
the
government
does
not
object.
having
determined
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
its
holding
on
the
law,
the
court
of
appeals
nonetheless
reversed
on
the
facts.
it
reviewed
the
facts,
the
objective
facts
cited
by
the
district
court
below
and
drew
different
inferences,
but
in
doing
so
it
necessarily
drew
inferences
that
the
district
court
had
in
fact
rejected.
this
court
has,
on
many
occasions,
held
that
the
questions
of
intent
are
factual
questions
for
the
trier
of
fact.
in
fact,
where
intent
itself
requires
some
showing
of
actual
motive
or
purpose
or
understanding,
this
court's
opinion
in
pullman-standard
v.
swint
held
that
the
legal
presumption
to
be
drawn
from
factual
showings
less
than
actual
motive
was
not
proper.
but
that
is
precisely
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
here.
it
found
new
facts
by
making
certain
limited
inferences,
but
in
doing
so
it
did
not
cite
rule
52(a),
it
did
not
discuss
or
define
the
proper
standard
of
review,
other
than
to
make
a
passing
reference
that
the
court
below
was
clearly
erroneous,
it
did
not
discuss
testimony--
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
--i
think
the
government
had
to
prove
expressly
that
the
parties
intended
to
make
payments
that
were
compensation
for
federal
services.
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
i
think
a
motive
to
fairly
sever
relations
with
long-standing
employees,
to
make
sure
that--
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
--no
one
got
it
except
individuals
who
were
compelled
to
terminate
their
employment
with
the
company
to
enter
into
public
service.
there
is
ample
evidence
in
the
record
that
boeing
supported
a
general
policy
of
encouraging
public
service,
and
that
under
circumstances
it
did
not
require
that
there
be
a
complete
severance
from
the
company,
no
severance
payment
was
paid
because
no
severance
was
made.
under
those
circumstances,
it
was
not
infrequently
the
case
that
people
were
permitted
to
continue
to
participate
in
various
company
benefits
programs,
were
able
to
take
a
leave
of
absence
without
pay,
or
in
some
cases
a
leave
of
absence
with
pay.
this
was
the
only
circumstance,
federal
government
service,
of
an
encouraged,
public
service
that
required
absolute
severance
from
the
company.
and
that
is
the
reason
that
severance
payments
were
only
made
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
that
has
long
perplexed
us.
at
trial
the
government
for
the
first
time
took
the
position
that
its
cause
of
action
of
boeing,
against
boeing,
was
a
common
law
tort
of
inducing
a
conflict
of
interest
situation.
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
it
is.
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
well,
the
exact
language
in
paragraph
16
of
the
complaint
says
the
common
law
tort
of
inducing
a
conflict
of
interest
situation.
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
conversely,
the
claims
against
the
individuals
was
sounded
in
quasi
contract
for
their
supposed
breech
of
an
undivided...
duty
of
undivided
loyalty.
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
i
do
not
think
they
would,
and
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
both
held
they
could
not
based
on
the
precedent
of
continental
management
case.
i
believe
that
if
the
government
made
out
a
prima
facia
case,
that
the
standard,
or
the
quantum
of
damages,
based
on
other
precedent,
might
be
the
amount
of
a
payment.
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
the
supposed
tort
duty
that
the
government
claimed
was--
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
--derived
from
this
criminal
statute.
so,
in
order
to
show...
to
make
out
the
common
law
tort,
they
would
have
to
show
a
violation
of
the
criminal
statute.
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
i,
i...
we
don't
believe
that
the
intent
requires
a
quid
pro
quo
or
a
specific
intent
to
influence
government
service,
but
at
least
must
be
an
intent
to
compensate
for
government
services.
at
the
very
minimum,
justice
scalia--
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
it
is
paid
under
circumstances...
among
other
reasons
it
is
paid
under
circumstances
that
could
not
conceivably
create
a
conflict
of
interest
or
a
potential
for
divided
loyalties--
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
--in
the
facts
of
this
case
it
would
fall
far
short
of
a
quid
pro
quo
in
any
event,
in
that
these
payments
were
fixed,
final
and
irrevocable.
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
the
only
suggestion
i
can
make
is
to
read
some
meaning
into
the
phrase
that
would
cover
a
conflict
of
interest,
and
if
you
construe
that
phrase
in
a
fashion
where
there
could
be
no
conceivable
conflict
of
interest,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
an
overbroad
reading
of
it,
that
doesn't
serve
the
purpose
of
preventing
the
evil
which
congress
sought
to
prevent.
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
the
statute,
as
originally
enacted,
obviously
was
directed
at
the...
at
the
receipt
of
payments
during
a
period
of
time
where
the
performance
of
government
services
was
being
rendered,
where
there
was
a
temptation,
or
at
least
a
potential
for
influence
of
that
government
service,
to
assure
that
that
economic
benefit
was
continued
to
be
received.
if
you
have
a
factual
pattern
that
does
not
present
that
same
potential,
i
don't
understand
how
it
would
be
reasonable
to
construe
the
statute
so
broadly
as
to...
as
to
sweep
up
factual
patterns
which
could
not
conceivably
constitute
a
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
i
think
implicit
in
the
"as
compensation
for"
language
is...
is
the
notion
that
the
payor
is
intending
something
that
would
create
a
conflict
of
interest,
some
impropriety.
it
simply
cannot
mean
the
confluence
of
events
of
government
service
in
the
receipt
of
moneys.
and
if
it...
if
it
meant
that
only,
then
every
severance
payment
would
be
outlawed.
and
if
you
don't
read
some--
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
--they
clearly
cannot
do
that.
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
well,
under
those
circumstances
certainly
the
employee
would
be
acting
at
a
time
he
was
receiving
discretionary--
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
--funds--
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
--which
could
tempt
him,
could
influence
him,
in
a
way
that
pre-employment
severance
payments
could
not.
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
the
second
issue
that
we
wish
to
cover
briefly
has
to
do
with
the
court
of
appeals'
determining
that
although
there
was
no
conflict
of
interest,
that
an
appearance
of
a
conflict
of
interest
was
both
sufficient
to
violate
the
statute
and
sufficient
toward
injury
for
the
united
states
to
recover.
we
believe
this
conclusion
is
both
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law
and
insufficient...
excuse
me,
wrong
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
appearance
of
conflict
of
interest
standard
is
dangerously
imprecise.
it
has
been
in
the
past--
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
--i
think
it
goes
to
the
statutory
construction
and
to
the
issue
of
whether
there
has
been--
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
--that's
correct.
mr.
benjamin
s.
sharp
again,
simply
that
the
construction
of
a
conflict
of
interest
statute
ought
to
be
such
to
give
some
meaning
to
the
evil
which
congress
sought
to
prevent.
if
there
was
no
conflict
of
interest,
an
overbroad
reading
would
seem
unwarranted.
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
an
appearance
of
conflict
of
interest
is
sufficient
injury
in
tort
for
the
united
states
to
recover.
we
would
suggest
that
it
is
not
sufficient
injury
for
a
tort
recovery
and
that
really
what
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying
here
is
that
where
there
is
no
proof
of
a
conflict
of
interest,
if
there
is
a
bad
appearance
to
the
court
it
is
sufficient
injury
and
is
sufficient
to
violate
the
statute.
we
think
in
part
that
that
is
a
dangerous
precedent,
because
if
there
is
no...
if
there
is
insufficient
evidence
to
prove
a
conflict
of
interest,
it
makes
little
sense
to
claim
that
although
there
is
some
probability
that
conflict
occurred,
but
not
proven,
that
we
would
nonetheless,
as
an
appellate
court,
find...
find
an
appearance
was
sufficient
to
predicate
liability
and
damages.
in
other
situations,
courts
have
used
conflict
of
interest
also,
or
appearance
of
conflict
of
interest,
to
describe
those
situations
where
there
was
a
clear
and
irreducible
conflict
of
interest.
and
in
those
circumstances,
as
in
the
kenealy
case
cited
in
all
the
briefs,
i
would
suggest
that
an
appearance
of
conflict
of
interest
is
either
surplusage,
in
that
all
actual
conflicts
would
appear
to
be
conflicts,
or
it's
a
misnomer
in
that
there
is
a
good
deal
more
than
appearance
of
conflict
of
interest
in,
for
example,
a
failed
bribe
or
a
self...
economic
self-dealing
situation
that
are
proscribed
by
statutes
201
and
208.
in
this
case
we
have
found
no
other
case
where
liability
was
predicated
or
injury
was
found
based
on
the
appearance
of
conflict
of
interest.
it
seems
to
us
where
the
court
of
appeals
holds
that
there
is
in
fact
no
conflict
of
interest,
the
appearance
is
insufficient
on
which
to
predicate
liability.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
