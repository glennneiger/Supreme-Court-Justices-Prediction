mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government's
claim
to
recover
the
severance
payments
that
boeing
made
to
its
employees
suffers
from
several
significant
flaws.
the
three
issues
before
the
court
this
morning
are
the
following.
first,
section
209
of
title
18,
on
which
the
government
relied
exclusively
as
defining
the
fiduciary
duty
that
the
employees
allegedly
breached,
does
not
apply
to
pre-employment
severance
payments.
second,
the
fourth
circuit
overstepped
the
proper
bounds
of
a
reviewing
court
in
disregarding
the
amply-grounded
findings
of
the
trial
court
that
none
of
these
men
accepted
that
severance
payment
with
the
kind
of
intent
that
section
209
in
other
situations
may
prescribe.
and
third,
under
a
common
law
claim
to
recover
the
value
of
any
secret
payments,
adequate
disclosure
of
the
type
that
the
trial
court
found
here,
bars
a
claim
by
an
employer
for
recovery
of
any
conflicting
financial
arrangements.
let
me
turn
first
to
the
statutory
coverage
question.
this
is
an
issue
on
which
all...
all
roads
lead
to
rome:
statutory
language,
legislative
history
and
legislative
purpose.
the
language
of
the
statute,
as
it
was
revised
in
1962,
which
appears
on
page
1a
of
our
brief
from
mr.
crandon,
et
al.,
could
not
be
more
clear,
we
submit.
the
statute,
as
it
is
common
ground,
defines
two
correlative
offenses.
certain
kinds
of
compensatory
payments
that
are
made
by
or
received
by
government
employees
are
prohibited.
looking
first
at
the
statutory
application
to
the
payor,
in
this
case
boeing,
the
statute
says,
and
i
will,
i
think
fairly
allied
the
unnecessary
language,
whoever
pays
or
makes
any
contribution
to
or
in
any
way
supplements
the
salary
of
any
such
officer
or
employee,
meaning
officer
or
employee
of
the
united
states,
is
guilty
of
a
crime.
the
one
overarching
issue
with
which
the
government
has
never
come
to
grips
in
this
case
is
the
following.
could
the
government,
the
day
after
these
payments
were
made
by
boeing
to
employees
still
on
its
payroll,
who,
as
it
was
stipulated
below
and
found
by
the
trial
court,
not
only
were
not
government
employees,
but
not
had...
had
not
been
assured
government
employment
or
even
formally
offered
government
employment,
could
the
government
have
indicted
boeing
for
violating
section
209
the
day
after
these
payments
were
made,
days
or
weeks
or
in
several
cases
months
before
these
men
actually
became
government
employees.
i
submit
the
answer
to
that
is
clearly
no,
for
the
same
reason
boeing
could
not
have
indicted
the
employees.
mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
i
think
not.
the
government
certainly
has
never
alleged
in
this
case
that
the
conduct
here
constituted
an
attempt
to
commit
crime.
mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
i
think
probably
not,
although
the
general
law
of
attempt
does
apply
to
many
criminal
cases.
but
here
what
you
have
is
a
statutory
definition
of
a
particular
conflict
of
interest
crime,
and
for
reasons
that
we
will
discuss
in
a
moment,
justice
kennedy,
congress
drew
the
line
where
it
wanted
to
draw
the
line
in
distinguishing
lawful
conduct
from
unlawful
conduct.
and
it
is
important,
i
think,
to
preserve
that
bright-line
distinction,
lest
we
criminalize
a
whole
category
of
relationships
that
congress
never
intended
to
cat...
to
criminalize.
mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
that
is
an
issue
with
which
congress
has
dealt,
justice
o'connor,
in
other
sections.
and
it
is
very
important
to--
mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
--no,
no.
it
would
not.
mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
that's
right.
and
that
is
explicable,
i
think,
in
light
of
the--
mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
--well,
our
opening
submission,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
that
is
not
a
correct
reading
of
the
language
and
that
under
the
rule
of
lenity,
if
your
suggestion
is
that
one
could
read
the
statute
this
way,
ambiguities
in
criminal
statutes
are
to
be
resolved
against
the
government.
where
you
have
statutory
language
that
talks
about
making
a
payment
to,
or
a
contribution
to,
or...
supplementing
the
salary
of
a
government
officer
or
employee,
i
suggest
it
is
at
least
a
strained
reading
to
say
that
the
timing
makes
no
difference.
but
when
you
look
at
what
congress
has
done
in
trying
to
deal
with
the
problem
that
you
identify
it
becomes
clear,
and
this
is
why
i
say
that
in
reading
this
statutory
language,
as
revised
in
1962,
the
court
ought
to
consider
the
other
statutes
that
congress
revised
in
1962.
the
bribery
statute
expressly
deals
with
that
situation.
congress
knew
how
to
write
that
language.
it
covers
payments
made
not
only
to
incumbent
federal
officers
or
employees,
but,
as
the
statute
defines
it,
persons
"selected
to
be"
public
officers
or
employees.
similarly,
section
203
of
title
18,
which
was
revised
at
the
same
time
as
this
statute
was
revised,
punish...
punishes
certain
kinds
of
compensatory
payments
made
to
a
person
for
services
to
be
rendered
at
a
time
when
he
is
a
government
officer
or
employee.
so
there
are
two
examples
of
congress'
knowledge
of
how
to
reach
pre-government
employment
payments,
if
they
are
made
with
the
kinds
of
intent
that
are
described
in
section
201
and
section
203.
mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
that
is
correct.
the
fourth
circuit
relied
exclusively
on
that
change.
it
is,
i
think,
common
ground
now
that
the
predecessor
to
this
statute
only
reached
payments
to
incumbents.
it
said
whoever
being
a
government
officer
or
employee
accepts
the
payment
is
guilty
of
a
crime.
congress
took
that
out
in
1962.
it
did
it,
however,
with
an
explanation
of
what
limited
changes
it
intended
to
accomplish
in
revising
the
language.
we
have
set
these
out
in
our
brief
because
we
think
it
is
important
to
do
what
the
fourth
circuit
apparently
didn't
do,
which
is
to
read
congress'
own
explanation
of
whether
it
was
intending
to
make
what
i
submit
would
be
a
fairly
substantial
change
in
the
coverage
that
the
statute
had
in
its
prior
form,
which
was
clearly
limited
by
time
to
incumbent
government
employees.
page
10a
is
the
senate
report;
page
<twenty-five
a@l>
[=
25a]
of
our
appendix
to
the
brief
sets
forth
the
house
report,
and
just
let
me
read
the
two
sentences.
section
209
is
similar
to
title
18
united
states
code,
section
1914.
the
latter,
that
is
the
predecessor,
prohibits
a
government
employee
from
receiving
any
salary
in
connection
with
its
government
service
from
a
private
source.
subsection
(a)
of
section
209
would
reenact
this
prohibition
in
substance,
et
cetera.
the
house
report
reads
the
same
way.
attorney
general
kennedy,
whose
administration
had
proposed
the
bill
that
ultimately
became
law,
and
this
is
set
forth
on
page
47a,
said
exactly
the
same
thing.
comparing
the
old
statute
with
the
new,
subsection
(a)
prevents
an
officer
or
employee
of
the
executive
branch
from
receiving,
and
anyone
from
paying
him
any
salary
or
supplementation
from
a
private
source,
et
cetera.
this...
provision
uses
much
of
the
language
of
former
section
1914
and
does
not
vary
from
that
statute
in
substance.
congress--
mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
--if
we
were
sitting
down
today
to
write
legislations,
chief
justice,
we
might
want
to
draw
the
line
differently.
but
that
is
not
the
purpose
that
the
statute
had
in
mind
when
it
was...
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
first
enacted
this
statute
in
1917,
which
was
to
prevent
carrying
people
on
the
payroll
of
a
private
benefactor
with
the
concern
being,
a
concern
that
doesn't
apply
when
the
payment
is
made
before
government
service,
the
concern
being
that
the
person
who
is
supposedly
discharging
his
duties
with
an
eye
solely
on
the
public
interest
may
be
looking
over
his
shoulder
to
see
whether
or
not
his
judgments
will...
will
affect
whether
that
economic
lifeline,
as
the
new
york
city
bar
put
it,
is
going
to
be
cut
off.
that
danger
is
simply
not
there,
the
danger
of
divided
loyalty,
serving
two
masters,
when
an
irrevocable,
fixed,
non-contingent
payment
is
made
before
government
service.
now,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
if
there
is
some
other
understanding,
that
could
constitute
a
bribe.
congress
has
defined
the
point
where
the
bribery
statute
applies,
at
a
certain
point
before
government
employment,
but
not
at
the...
not
infinitely
back
from
government
employment.
so,
congress
has
decided
to
deal
with
a
particular
problem,
divided
loyalty.
it
rationally
chose
to
draw
the
line
at
incumbency.
section
1914,
it
has
certainly
drawn
the
line
there.
the
explanation
for
the
changes
in
language
in
1962
suggest
only...
only
a
narrowing
purpose,
changing
the
prior
phrase
in
connection
with
government
employment
to
a
phrase,
as
compensation
for
government
employment.
and
if
congress
had
intended
to
cover
a
whole
new
class
of
payments,
especially
in
light
of
the
fact
that
severance
payments,
pre-employment
severance
payments,
are,
as
the
government
has
agreed,
quite
common,
one
would
think
that
congress
would
have
said
something
about
that.
when
one
looks
at
the
reasons
for
dropping
the
magic
phrase
on
which
the
fourth
circuit
exclusively
focused,
one
sees
that,
in
the
original
staff
report
back
in
1958,
a
house
staff
report,
there
was
a
suggestion
that
that
phrase
be
taken
out,
because
the
staff
wanted
to
cover
not
only
officers
of
the
executive
branch,
but
also
members
of
congress.
and
the
phrase
being
a
government
officer
or
employee
would
not
have
covered
those
congressmen,
that
the--
mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
--i
think
not,
justice
kennedy,
because
it...
i
think
it
is
common
ground
that
these
are
supposed
to
be
correlative
offenses.
indeed,
in
the
second
paragraph
the
payer's
defense--
mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
--yes,
for
services
as
a
government
officer
or
employee.
and
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that,
to
the
extent
there
is
any
doubt
about
whether
congress
intended
to
reach
only
payments
received
by
government...
incumbent
government
officials,
one
can
appropriately
take
guidance
from
the
second
paragraph,
which
says
all
congress
is
penalizing
on
the
payor
side
is
the
payment
to
a
government
employee
under
circumstances
that
would
make
it
illegal
for
him
to
accept
it,
namely
it's
accepted
with
compensatory
intent.
mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
justice
scalia,
as
i
mentioned
before,
there
might
be
an
ambiguity--
mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
--in
the
first
paragraph.
if
one--
mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
--if
one
read
this
paragraph,
if
that
was
all
that
existed
in
title
18,
there
would
be
an
ambiguity,
which
under
the
rule
of
lenity
would
have
to
be
resolved
in
our
favor
in
any
event.
but
one
has
the
second
paragraph
here,
and
one
also
has
section
201
and
section
203.
and
when
you
read
those
statutes,
without
even
getting
behind
them
into
legislative
purpose
or
legislative
history,
i
think
you
are
drawn
rather
firmly
to
the
conclusion
that
when
congress
wanted
to
reach
pre-employment
payments
it
used
a
form
of
words.
indeed,
the
city
bar,
in
proposing
a
revision
of
this
predecessor,
section
1914,
the
predecessor
of
this
section,
did
propose
to
add
language
that
not
only
dropped
the
being
a
government
officer
or
employee
language,
but
proposed
adding
the
language
that
congress
used
in
203,
for
services
to
be
rendered
when
the
person
is
a
government
employee.
so,
you
have
here,
i
think,
a
rather
clear
statutory
pattern.
certain
kinds
of
pre-employment
payments
are
covered,
others
are
not--
mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
--we
have
never
doubted
that
there
is
a
common
law
cause
of
action
to
recover
secret
profits
obtained
in
breach
of
trust.
there
is
ample
common
law
doctrine,
federal
common
law
doctrine,
that
that
does
exist.
all
of
the
cases,
however,
as
the
fourth
circuit
itself
recognized,
are
limited
to
circumstances
in
which
the...
the
tainting
outside
financial
relationship
is
undisclosed,
secret,
so
that
the
employer,
new
employer--
mr.
phillip
allen
lacovara
--that
is...
the
government
would
make
out
its
prima
facia
burden
if
there
had
been
an
illegal
receipt
of...
in
violation
of
section
209,
but
it
is
at
least
a
defense
that
that
relationship
was
disclosed.
and
that
is
what
we
have
argued
below
and
what
we
think
is
supported
by
federal
common
law.
