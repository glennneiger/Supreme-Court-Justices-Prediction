justice
stevens
mr.
sharp,
what
is
it...
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
intent
requirement
in
the
statute?
what
do
you
think
the
government
had
to
prove?
justice
stevens
what
other
motive
could
there
possibly
have
been
for
the
payments
by
boeing?
justice
stevens
but
nobody
got
this
except
people
who
were
going
into
government
service.
justice
stevens
--except
here
you
have
got
a
series
of
findings
which
totally
negate
any
improper
actual
conduct.
there
is
no...
no
motive
to
do
anything
like
that.
but
then
there
is
this
finding
22
that
says
they
were
not
intended
as
supplementation
for
government
service
or
as
compensation.
i
don't
know
quite...
i'm
really
kind
of
puzzled
as
to
what
that
means.
does
that
mean
that
boeing
did
not
have
a
policy
of
giving
extra
money
to
people
who
were
going
into
service
because
they
thought
that
(a)
there's
a
public
purpose
to
be
served,
and
(b)
these
may
be
more
valuable
employees
when
they
get
back
later,
which
are...
neither
of
which
is...
when
they
get
out
of
government
service,
neither
of
which
is
necessarily
an
invidious
motive.
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
but
it
does
seem
rather
clear
that
the
company
must
have
thought
that
these
people
were
going
to
have
a
financial
sacrifice
during
this
period
of
government
service,
and
they
wanted
to
help
them
over
a
tough
period.
and...
but
you
are
saying...
i
am
trying
to
figure
out...
is
that
what
the
statute
prohibits?
or,
if
it
is,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
finding
is
clearly
erroneous,
frankly.
i
just
can't
see
how
you
can
under...
construe
these
payments
otherwise.
but
maybe
it
requires
something
more,
and
if
it
requires
something
more,
just
what
is
it?
justice
stevens
well,
but
if
that
only
it
would
cover
the
case
of
say,
well,
we'll
keep
your
salary
going
while
you
are
in
washington.
they
clearly
can't
do
that.
justice
stevens
but
that
would
cover
it
even
though
it
was
totally
benign
in
motive.
say
he
isn't
going
to
do
any
work
at
all
on
boeing
matters
and
never
coming
back
to
work,
but
we
just
think
this
is
a
decent
individual
who
ought
to
be
given
the
equivalent
of
the
kind
of
award
that
justice
scalia
describes.
that
still--
justice
stevens
--right.
justice
stevens
the
statute
plainly--
justice
stevens
yes,
but
that
wouldn't
be...
that
wouldn't
be
sufficient
to
make
out
a
violation
of
the
statute
if
they
never
went
to
work
for
the
government,
would
it?
justice
stevens
and
if
he
never...
if
they
never
went
to
work
for
the
government,
you
say
the
statute
would
have
been
violated?
justice
stevens
well,
because
the
statute
reads
on
that.
but
you
think
that
this,
they
would
have...
that
is
very
interesting,
i
didn't
realize
you
went
that
far.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
well,
there
may
be,
because
if
the
statute
wasn't
violated
when
they
paid
them,
because
of
the
possibility
they
might
not
go
to
work
for
the
government,
that
conceivably
would
be
a
reason
for
your
losing
the
case.
justice
stevens
no,
it
is
not
a
condition
subsequent.
it
is,
the
fact
is
they
were
not
employees
at
the
time
they
received
the
payments.
justice
stevens
and
if
they
never
became
employees,
it
is
a
little
difficult
for
me
to--
--i
didn't
know
that
it
was
clear
that
these
employees
had
agreed
to
go
to
work
for
the
government,
if
that
job
was
offered.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
what
if,
instead
of
paying
severance
payments,
boeing
had
a
policy
of
paying
bonuses
upon
employment
after
government
service,
and
paid
precisely
the
same
amounts...
i
don't
know
whether
these
people
did
go
back
to
boeing,
but
assume
they
had
been
totally
severed,
worked
for
the
government
for
three
or
four
years,
then
went
to
work
for
boeing
and
received
advance
payments
that
more
or
less
supplemented
for
the
sacrifice
they
had
made
in
the
prior
three
years.
justice
stevens
so
it
applies
to...
if
a
law
firm
hires
a
person
out
of
government
service
and
pays
a
higher
signing
bonus,
in
effect,
to
compensate
for
the
decreased
earnings
while
in
government
service,
that
would
violate
this
statute,
if
it
is
an
executive
employee.
justice
stevens
the
presumption
of
increased
experience...
in
other
words,
would
boeing
be
safe
if
they
had
elaborate
explanation
that
the
purpose
of
their
policy
was
because
they
thought
these
people
would
be
back,
likely
come
back,
and
they
would
have
increased
experience
when
they
got
back,
and
therefore
be
more
valuable
to
them.
would
that
be
permissible?
justice
stevens
well,
if
that
is
conceivable
and
that
is
permissible,
then
how
do
we
know
these
findings
are
clearly
erroneous?
justice
stevens
on
intent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
these
cases
come
to
us
on
writs
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
five
individual
petitioners,
each
received
substantial
severance
payments
from
the
boeing
company,
which
is
also
a
petitioner
in
one
case,
before
leaving
their
jobs
at
boeing
to
take
jobs
at
the
executive
branch
of
the
federal
government.
the
government
brought
an
action
seeking
to
recover
the
amount
of
the
payments
against
the
employee
and
boeing
alleging
violations
of
criminal
statute
18
u.s.c.
section
209(a)
which
forbids
a
private
party
to
pay
and
a
government
employee
to
receive
any
supplemental
compensation
for
the
employee’s
government
service.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
section
209(a)
does
not
apply
to
a
severance
payment
made
before
a
payee
becomes
a
government
employee.
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute’s
text,
as
well
as
application
of
the
rule
of
lenity
support
our
conclusion
that
a
recipient’s
status
as
a
government
employee
is
an
element
of
a
section
209(a)
violation.
the
judgment
is
accordingly
reversed.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
o’connor
and
justice
kennedy
have
joined.
