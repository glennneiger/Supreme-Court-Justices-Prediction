chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
89-931,
lawrence
crandon
v.
united
states,
and
number
88-938,
boeing
company
v.
united
states.
mr.
lacovara.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lacovara--
--mr.
lacovara,
the
fourth
circuit
relied
upon
the
1962
change
in
this
statute
to
say
that
whatever
may
have
been
the
case
before
then,
they
thought
it
now
covered
pre-employment
payment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
it
leaves
a
rather
large
hole
in
the
statutory
scheme,
doesn't
it,
if
an
employer,
a
month
before
someone
becomes
a
government
employee,
can
pay
them
a
large
amount
of
money
to
tide
them
over
the
time
that
they
will
be
a
government
employee.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--does
this
depend
on
the
statutory
construction,
mr.
sharp,
or
does
this
go
to
the
measure
of
recovery
or
the
nature
of
the
common
law
tort?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
of
course
the
statute
doesn't
say
conflict
of
interest
at
all.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
when
you
say
the...
to
say
there
was
no
conflict
of
interest,
how
does
that
cut
one
way
or
the
other
with
respect
to
the
statutory
construction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sharp.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
although
this
was
a
civil
case,
i
guess
it
is
based
on
a
criminal
statute.
is
the...
is
the
statute
to
be
construed
the
same
way
as
if
it
were
a
criminal
proceeding?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
presumably
the
rule
of
lenity
would
have
some
application?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
do
you
know
it
is
a
fiduciary
duty
that
the
statute
defines,
or...
ordinarily
an
employee
does
not
have
a
fiduciary
duty
to
his
employer,
does
he,
just
in
the
normal
course
of
events?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why...
you
know,
when
you
say
there
is
a
violation
of
a
fiduciary
duty
that
suggests
some
extraordinarily
high
duty,
to
me,
that
you
don't
find
among
ordinary
relationships.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
is
this
a
fiduciary
duty?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
can't...
well
then,
he
can
insist
upon
that
without
regard
to
statute?
every
employer
can
insist
upon
that
as
a
fiduciary
obligation
from
every
employee?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--where
does
it
define
the
scope
of
the
relationship?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
how
does
that
define
the
relationship
of
employer
to
employee?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
is
a
prophylactic
rule
to
prevent
disloyalty.
it
really
doesn't
define
the
loyalty.
in
any
event,
you
don't
claim
that
there
is
a
cause
of
action
under
this
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
are
tacking
a
common
law
cause
of
action
onto
section
209,
and
if
the
common
law
cause
of
action
traditionally
has
required
non-disclosure
in
order...
as
an
element,
it
did...
really
the
shoe
is
on
the
other
foot,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
is
crucial
to
the
government's
case
here,
isn't
it,
that
the
structure
of
the
boeing
severance
payment
was
based
on
future
hardship
rather
than
past
performance?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-931,
crandon
against
united
states
and
a
companion
case
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
