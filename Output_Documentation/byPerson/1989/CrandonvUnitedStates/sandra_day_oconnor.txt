justice
o'connor
what
if
the
employer,
before
the
government
service
began,
paid
a
sum
to
the
employee
on
the
understanding
and
expectation
that
the
employee
might
provide
some
favors
to
that
employer
later,
during
government
service.
justice
o'connor
would
it
violate
this
section
as
well?
justice
o'connor
simply
because
of
the
timing.
justice
o'connor
well,
you
certainly
can
read
the
language
of
the
statute
as
not
turning
on
the
timing
of
the
payment.
if...
if
the
payment
is
made
to
supplement
the
government
salary,
you
certainly
can
read
section
209
as
being
applicable.
justice
o'connor
mr.
lacovara,
do
you
mind
my
asking
whether
you
concede
that
there
is
a
civil
cause
of
action
by
the
government
for
whatever
it
is
the
statute...
the
criminal
statute,
says?
is
there
a
common
law
cause
of
action
to
cover
the
exact
contours
of
whatever
this
statute
means?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
is
your
answer?
that
the
cause
of
action
for
recovery
is
not
covered
exactly
by
the
contours
of
the
statute?
it
is
something
else?
justice
o'connor
what
exactly
do
you
understand
was
the
government's
theory
at
trial
in
its
cause
of
action
against
boeing?
justice
o'connor
is
that
how
it
went
to
the
trier
of
fact?
justice
o'connor
a
common
law
tort
of
inducing
breech
of
a
fiduciary
relationship?
justice
o'connor
uh
huh.
justice
o'connor
under
that
theory
would
the
government
be
entitled
to
recover
the
amounts
of
the
payments
from
the
employees
and
also
from
boeing,
a
double
recovery
sort
of?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
legislative
history
of
the
change,
though,
does
not
reflect
that
they
intended
to
broaden
the
scope,
does
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
kneedler,
this
is
a
criminal
statute.
do
you
think
that
the
contours
of
the
civil
recovery
are
defined
precisely
by
the
terms
of
this
statute?
justice
o'connor
just
because
there
is
a
criminal
statute,
does
that
automatically
give
the
government
the
right
to
a
civil
damages
action
for
its
violation?
justice
o'connor
right,
but
that,
that
common
law
cause
of
action
presumably
would
encompass
whether
there's
disclosure,
whether
there
were
secret
profits
taken,
or
something
of
that
sort.
justice
o'connor
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
think
the
statute
would
be
violated
by
programs
such
as
some
universities
have
of,
for
giving
student
loan
payments
to
students
who
go
into
government
service?
justice
o'connor
government
service
and
for
private
nonprofit
organizations.
justice
o'connor
would
that
save
it?
justice
o'connor
what
about
a
macarthur
foundation
grant
to
someone
who
has
performed
extraordinary
service
in
government?
justice
o'connor
it
certainly
would
be
a
supplement,
though,
under
your--
justice
o'connor
--understanding
of
the
statute.
