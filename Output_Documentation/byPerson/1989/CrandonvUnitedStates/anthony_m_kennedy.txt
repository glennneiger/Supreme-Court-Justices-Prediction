justice
kennedy
could
there
have
been
an
attempt
indictment
in
that
situation?
justice
kennedy
i'm
just
asking
hypothetically.
could,
would
the
facts
you
state
support
an
indictment
for
an
attempt?
justice
kennedy
do
you
make
the...
mr.
lacovara,
do
you
make
the
same
analysis
of
the
first
section...
of
the
first
paragraph
of
the
statute
as
of
the
second?
could
the
government's
position
fare
any
better
under
the
first
paragraph
than
it
does
under
the
second?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
the
second
paragraph
is
in
part
controlled
by
the
first,
because
they
talk
about
such
officer
or
employee,
and
the
first
paragraph
begins
whoever
receives.
justice
kennedy
if
the
employees
had
changed
their
mind
and
not
gone
to
work
for
the
government,
i
assume
boeing
couldn't
receive
this
back?
justice
kennedy
but
under
your
view,
the
government
could...
could
collect
the
money,
couldn't
it,
mr.
kneedler?
justice
kennedy
boeing
couldn't,
but
the
government
certainly
could
under
your
view.
justice
kennedy
well,
it's
not...
that
is
critical
to
your
interpretation
of
the
statute.
justice
kennedy
mr.
kneedler,
if
you
could
answer
one
short
question.
i
think
there
is
a
short
answer,
but
it
escapes
me
at
the
moment.
can
the
government,
or
does
the
government
ever
rely
on
state
law?
suppose
there
was
a
law
in
the
state
of
washington
that
protected
you
in
this
instance.
could
you
just
sue
under
the
washington
law?
or
is
the
argument
that
since
there
is
no
federal
law,
the
probable
intent
is
that
you
not
recover?
