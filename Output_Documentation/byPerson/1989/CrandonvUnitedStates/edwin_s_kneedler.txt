mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
payments
made
by
boeing
to
the
individual
petitioners
in
this
case
go
to
the
very
core
of
the
purposes
underlying
the
prohibition
in
section
209
against
the
private
supplementation
of
the
salaries
of
federal
employees.
those
purposes
are...
it
is
not
just
an
appearance
statute
as
mr.
sharp
said,
the
statute
defines
the
existence
of
dual
compensation
as
a
conflict
of
interest,
and
it
establishes
a
prophylactic
prohibition
against
the
temptations
that
might
arise
from
the
receipt
of
compensation.
as--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
statute
itself,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
terms
of
its
scope,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
in
terms
of
construing
the
scope,
in
terms
of
the
showing
of
intent
required,
we
don't
think
that
that
would
be...
that
that
would
be
necessary.
but
in
terms
of,
for
example,
the
scope
of
the
coverage
of
the
statute
to
pre-employment
payments,
yes,
we
believe
that
it
would.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
but
the
interpretation
of
the
first
paragraph...
the
first
paragraph
is
the...
is
the
essential
definition
of
the...
of
the
conduct
being
covered
and
informs
the
interpretation
of
the
second.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
mr.
lacovara
had
it
backwards
in
terms
of
which,
which
provision
of
the
statute
you
look
to
first.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right,
but
it...
it...
there
are
several
aspects
of
that
that
we
think
are
significant.
one
is,
it
says
in
any
way
supplements,
which
suggests
an
intent
to
establish
an
all
encompassing
prohibition.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
it's
referring
to,
it's
referring
to
someone
who,
who
is/was
an
employee.
but
in
terms
of
the
purpose
of
the
payment,
all
that
is
required
is
it
in
any
way
supplement
the
salary
of
an
employee.
and
the
first...
the
first
paragraph
is
written
in
all-encompassing
terms
with
no
exceptions
at
all.
it
says
whoever;
it
doesn't
say
whoever,
as
the
predecessor
did,
whoever
being
a
government
official
or
employee.
it
says
whoever
receives
any
salary
or
any
supplementation
of
salary.
both
the
all-encompassing
term
whoever
and
the
all-encompassing
term
any
suggests
an
intent
to
be
all
encompassing.
and
in
fact,
with
respect
to
the
precise
issue
here,
payments
received
from
prior
employers,
it
is
significant
that
the
second
subsection
of
section
209,
209(b),
specifically
provides
for
the
receipt
of
certain
payments
from
prior
employers,
permitting
continued
participation
and
severance
and
other
employee
benefit
plans
while
the
person's
in
government.
so,
just
looking
at
the
text
of
section
209,
it
seems
to
us
that
there
is
no
exclusion
for
lump
sum
payments.
it
says
supplementations
in
any
way.
and
this
is
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
section
209,
which
is
to
prevent
the
divided
loyalty.
if
a
person
receives,
just
as...
if
a
person
receives
a
bribe
before
he
goes
into
government
service,
the
assumption
would
be
that
that
bribe
might
continue
to
influence
his
performance
while
he
is
in
government.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
it
is
unnecessary
to
do
so,
because
the...
because
the
language--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--pardon
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
seems
to
me
it
is
all
encompassing.
whoever...
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
have
several
responses
to
that,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
as
we
point
out
at
pages
26
to
27
of
our
brief,
the
justice
department
had
in
fact
taken
the
position
before
the
amendment
of
the
statute
in
1962
and
the
provision
in
the
memo
quoted
in
the
roswell
perkins
law
review
article,
that
the...
that
the
statute
did
apply
to
severance
payments
made
prior
to
the
entry
onto
government...
government
service.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
understandable.
if
you
look
at
the...
turn
your
attention,
respectfully,
to
page
2(a)
of
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
where
the
prior
statute
is
reproduced.
and
the
second
paragraph...
the
first
paragraph
of
section
1914
did
contain
the
phrase,
after
the
word
whoever,
saying
being
a
government
official
or
employee.
the
second
paragraph,
however,
had
no
such
limitation.
it
says
or
in
any
way
supplements
the
salary
of
a
government
employee.
so...
and
one
of
the
problems
with
the
statute
as
it
read
prior
to
the
1962
amendments
was
there
was
an
absence
of
correlation
between
the
first
and
second
paragraphs.
and
so
there
was
substantial
support
for
the
proposition
that
the...
that
the
statute,
particularly
the
second
paragraph,
even
prior
to
the
passage
of
1962,
covered
such
payments,
and
in
fact
the
report
of
the
association
of
the
bar
of
the
city
of
new
york,
which
was
one
of
the
two
studies
that
gave
rise
to
the
1962
amendment,
specifically
noted
this
ambiguity
but
said
the
statute
should
be
clarified
to
make
sure
that
it
covers
payments
whenever
received.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
as
mr.
lacovara
conceded,
it
is
well
established
that
the
government
has
a...
has
a
cause
of
action
to
recover
payments
made
to
its
employees
in
violation
of
fiduciary
duties.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
think
the
cause
of
action
would
extend
to
violations
of
the
fiduciary
duty,
however
that
fiduciary
duty
is
defined.
this
statute
defines
the
fiduciary
duty
with
respect
to
the
receipt
of
payments
for
government
employment
that
contains
no
limitation
that
the...
that
the
profits
be
secret.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
or
a
principal
agency
relationship.
but,
defining...
defining
a
relationship
of
an
agent
to
his
principal
as
a
fiduciary
in
this
sense,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
specific
fiduciary
duty
at
issue
here
is
the
duty
of
undivided
loyalty
to
the
employer,
which
is
a
fiduciary
duty.
there
may
be
aspects
of
the
performance
of
the
job
that
are
ministerial,
but
with
respect
to
the
basic
demand
of
loyalty
that
an
employer
has
a
right
to
insist
upon
from
his
employees--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
as
i
say,
the
contours
of
the
employer/employee
relationship
would
be
defined
by
whatever
contract
or
whatever
statute
defines
that
relationship.
here
we
had
a
statute
that
precisely
defines
the
scope
of
the
relationship.
and
the
common
law--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--would
enforce
the
contract
between
the
parties.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it...
specifically,
section
209
says
that
a
person,
an
employee
or...
a
person
cannot
receive
any
compensation,
any
supplementation
of
his
salary
for
his
services
as
a
government
employee.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
defines
the
duty
of
loyalty
that
the
employee...
that
the
agent
owes
to
the
principal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
we
say
that
there
is...
well,
the
statute
doesn't
expressly
provide
a
civil
cause
of
action.
but
it
is
well
established
that
the
attorney
general
may
bring
a
suit
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
united
states
in
contracts
and
in
employment
relationships
and
its
property.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
to
enforce
a...
a
duty
defined
or
a
prohibition
defined
by
this
statute.
so
it...
the
cause
of
action
could
be
characterized
as
a
common
law--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
the...
the
particular
duty
being
enforced
here
is
defined
by
the
statute,
and
the
statute
does
not
make
the
secrecy
of
the
payments
an
element
of
the...
of
the
prohibition.
just
as,
in
the
mississippi
valley
case,
which
dealt
with
a
conflict
of
interest
on
the
part
of
a
government
employee
who
had
outside
financial
interests,
the
argument
there
was
made,
in
fact,
that
the
superior's
knowledge
of
the
fact
that
he
had
this
outside
financial
interest
eliminated
any
conflict,
and
that
the
contract
was
therefore
enforceable.
and
this
court
said
no,
the
statute
contains
no
provision
for
waiver.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
exactly
right.
the
statute
contains
no
provision
for
waiver.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
that
isn't
clear.
and
in
fact,
in
the
carter
case--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
is...
in
essence
it
does
say
that
because
there
is
no
exception
for
situations
in
which
the...
in
which
the
employee
has
disclosed
the
matter
to
the
government
and
gets
a
waiver.
and
in
fact
the
pertinent
disclosure
regulation
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
promulgated
by
the
office
of
government
ethics,
says
that
nothing
in
the
disclosure
program,
either
the
regulations
or
the
ethics
in
government
act,
excuses
an
employee
from
complying
with
applicable
statutes.
so
this
waiver
argument,
or
this
disclosure
argument,
is
inconsistent
not
only
with
section
209,
but
with
the
very
premises
of
the
financial
disclosure
program.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
think
not.
and
let
me
explain
again
why
i
think
that
is
not
so.
in
a
traditional
suit
of
common
law,
if
an
employer
brings
a
suit
against
his
employee,
he
would
be
bringing
a
suit
to
enforce
whatever
contractual
or
other
relationship
there
was
between
the
employer
and
the
employee,
according
to
the
terms
of
that
contract.
that's
exactly
what
we
are
saying
here.
this
statute,
section
209,
is
part
of
the
statutes,
the
body
of
statutes,
that
define
the
relationship
between
one
who
is
coming
to
be
employed
for
the
united
states
and
the
united
states.
it
is
an
element
of
that
contractual
relationship
which,
like
an
element
of
a
contractual
relationship
between
private
parties,
the
government
has
a
right
to
enforce.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
seems
to
me
our
submission
here
is
a...
is
a
lot
narrower
than
that,
and
that
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it's
well
accepted
even
in
common
law
that
when
an
agent
receives
money
from
a
third
party
for
the
performance
of
his
duties
to
the
principal,
he
has
a
duty
to
account
to
the
principal
for
the
profits
that
he
has
received.
that
is
just
a
straightforward
principle
of
agency,
as
well
as
restitutionary
law,
that
he...
because
he
is
performing
that...
those
services
for
the
principal,
not
the
third
party
who
pays
him,
he
has
a
duty
to
account
to
the
principal
for
those
funds.
and
that
is
essentially
the
nature
of
this
cause
of
action
against
the
individuals,
we're
just
asking
the
individuals
to
disgorge
the
profits
that
they
improperly
received
from
boeing
for
the
performance
of
their
federal
duties.
and
that
is
not
an
open-ended
cause
of
action.
it
is
one
firmly
rooted
in
the...
in
the
common
law,
and
209
in
that
sense
is
an
overlay
on
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
only
if
the...
only
if
the
second
employer
had
a
prohibition
against
the
receipt
of
the
compensation.
presume...
no,
in
the
example
you
are
citing,
yes,
he...
presumably
he
would,
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--he
would
have
been
compensated
for
the...
but
whether
or
not
the
general
common
law
would
say
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in
the
example
you
are
citing,
if
the
second
employer
had
a
specific
provision
in
its...
in
its
personnel
manual
or
its
contract--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
what
i
am
saying,
the
common
law
allows
parties
to
enforce
the
agreement
or
the
rules
that
govern
the
relationship
between
themselves.
it's
not
just
a
free
floating
body
of
law,
but
also
if
there
are
particular
provisions
in
the
contractual
relationship
or
in
the
appointment
relationship
of
federal
employees
that
define
the
duties,
that
go
beyond
the
common
law
or
that
give
particular
form
to
the
common
law,
then
the
parties
have
a
right
to
enforce
the
legal
duties
that
arise
between
them.
not
just
those
defined
by
common
law,
but
as
they
are
supplemented
by
contract
or
here,
by
statute
with
respect
to
the
relationship
between
government
employees.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
it
was
specifically
tied
to
government
service,
yes,
we
do.
if
there
was...
if
it
was
tied
to
some
somewhat
broader
range
of
public
service
that
included--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--at
some
point--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--at
some
point
it
would
be
sufficiently
broad,
and
we're
not
in
a
position
at
this
point
to
say
how
broad.
but
at
some
point
it
would
be
sufficiently
broad
so
that
it
was
not
focusing
on
government
employment
in
the
specific
sense
that
we
think
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
justice
department
has
taken
the
position
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
awards
made
to
government
employees
are
not
covered
by
section
209.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
would
be,
but
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
but
i
think
it,
i
think
it
goes
into
the,
it
is
tied
into
the
phrase
"as
compensation
for".
there
has
to
be
some
sense,
as
justice
scalia
was
saying,
that
the
statute
at
least
cover
the
situations
where
the
government
employment
is
the
consideration
for
the
making
of
the
payment,
the
performance
of
the
government
services.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
may
not
be
required
in
all
situations,
i
mean,
but
in
this
situation...
in
this
case
the
"as
compensation
for",
it
is
clear
that
the
federal
employment
was
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it's
clear...
it's
clear
that
these
payments
were
made
only
because
the
employees
planned
to
go
into
government
service.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
and
it...
the
language--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think
the
language
may
be
tied
to
the
"as
compensation
for"--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think
that
would
be...
that
would
be
considerably
more
difficult,
because
it
is
not...
it
is
not
for
past
accomplishment.
it
is
not
in
recognition
of
a
past
accomplishment.
i
think
it...
that
would
raise
the
suggestion
that
the
going
into
the
federal
government
to
perform
in
a
particular
way--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
that's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
what
the
statute
does...
only
reaches
payments
from
a
source
other
than
the
united
states.
so
when
the
government
itself
pays
the
bonuses,
the
statute
does
not
reach
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
if
i
could,
i
would
like
to
make
one
last
point
on
the
disclosure
before
i
go
back
to
the
statutory
language,
and
that
is
that
even
if...
even
if
the
common
law
rule
overrode
the
statute
or
the
statute
did
not
specifically
govern
here,
there
was
no
disclosure
here
of
the
nature
of
these
payments
sufficient
to
constitute
the
kind
of
disclosure
that
is
talked
about
under
those
cases.
there
was
nothing
in
the
disclosure
to,
either
on
the
disclosure
forms
or
in
the
conversations
with
individual
officials
at
the
defense
department,
to
suggest
that
these
were
payments
made
only
because
the
employees
were
going
into
government
service
or
that
they
were
calculated
in
a
way
that
were
validly
designed
to
supplement
the
government...
the
employee's
services.
so
there
was
nothing
on
the
face
of
these
forms
to
alert
the
persons
reviewing
them
that
they
even
presented
a
conflict
of
interest
situation
that
the
government
could
in
turn
waive
or
regard
as
being
an
affirmative
disclosure.
so
there
is
just
not
the
factual
basis
in
this
case
for
the
argument
that
is
being
made.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is
crucial
that
it
was
not
based
on
past
performance.
there
are
two
factors
that
we
rely
on
in
particular
here.
one
is
that
it
was
paid
only
because
they
were
going
to...
into
the
government
service,
and
in
fact,
as
we
point
out
at
page
40
of
our
brief,
only
because
they
were
going
to
positions
that
were
of
interest
to
boeing.
but
then
also,
that
the
payments
were
calculated
on...
to
essentially
supplement
the
salaries
by
making
up
the
salary
differential.
that
makes
it
particularly
clear
that
they...
that
the
payments
were
for
future
service
rather
than
past.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
was
the
understanding
that
the
district
court
found,
yes.
but
as
mr.
little,
the
vice
president
at
boeing,
testified
in
his
deposition,
the...
boeing
had
no
reason
to
doubt
that
these
employees
were
going
to
go
into
the
government
when
they
left.
now,
it
may
be
that,
for
reasons
beyond
the
recipient's
control,
the
government
wouldn't
appoint
him.
but
as
far
as
boeing
was
concerned
it
was
part
of
the
deal,
i
think,
that
these
employees
would
follow
through
with
their
commitment
to
accept
the
government
jobs
as
they
were
offered.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that,
that...
i
think
it
would,
if...
or
at
least
on
an
attempt
theory.
but
if
the
payments
are
made
for
the
purpose
of
supplementing
the
salary
of
someone
when
he
goes
to
work
for
the
government,
yes.
in
this
case,
though--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
in
the
same
way
that
paying
a
bribe
to
somebody
in
anticipation
that
he
is
going
to
go
work
for
the
government.
if
he
doesn't--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
there
is
no
need
to
reach
that
question
here,
because
in
fact--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
there
was
a
condition
subsequent,
such
as
you
are
suggesting,
that
they
actually
have
to
become
employed,
then
that
was
satisfied
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
correct,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
had...
they
had
planned
to,
and
they
had
agreed--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
hadn't
entered
into
a
formal
agreement,
but
they...
but
the...
as
we
cite
in
the
footnote
at--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
they
left...
i
think
it's
a,
the
only
fair
reading
of
the
record
that
both
sides
anticipated
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
what
i...
what
i
said,
if
something
happened
for
reasons
beyond
their
control
that
they
didn't
accept
it,
but
i
think
the
understanding
was
that
when
they
left,
the
plan
was
they
were
going
to
work
for
boeing
unless
some
other--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--perhaps
not.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
according...
the
district
court
said
it
was
theirs
to
keep.
all
i
am
saying--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--uh--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it...
it's
possible
that
the
government
could,
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
this,
yes.
in
terms
of
the
criminal
violation,
for
purposes
of
the
civil
recovery,
all
that's
necessary
for
the
court
to
say
is
that
at
least
at
the
time
they
became
federal
employees
they
had
a
duty
to
account
to
the
government
for
any
payments
they
received
for
their
government
service
prior
to
that
time.
and
that's
all
that
is
necessary
to
say
here.
they
all...
all
five
in
fact
did
quickly
become
government
employees
after
they
received
these
payments.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
would
be
the
same
result,
and
for
good
reason.
if
a
person,
while
in
government
service,
has
reason
to
anticipate
that
he
is
going
to
be
rewarded
in
the
same
way--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
it...
again
it
would
depend
on
the
purpose.
if
the
bonus
is
paid
because
of
the
presumption
of
the
increased
experience,
which
i
think
may
be
the
basis
for
the
signing
bonuses
for
people
coming
from
the
government,
that
would
be
all
right.
but
if
it
was...
if
it
was
explicitly
intended--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--excuse
me,
conceivably,
yes,
it
would.
but,
but
at
that
point
it
gets
very
difficult
to
separate
what--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
they--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
they
are
being
paid...
if
they
are
being
paid
for...
if
they
are
essentially
being
paid
for
their
government
work,
as
it
seems
to
me
these
people
were
being
paid
to
accept
their
government
job,
that's
sufficient.
but
if
they
are
being
paid
because,
after
they
leave,
because
of
the
experience
they
will
have
acquired
there,
that
is
forward
looking,
when
they
go
back
to
the
former
employer.
and
the
statute,
if
you
are
paying
somebody
for
what
he
is
worth,
wherever
he
gained
that
experience,
the
statute
doesn't
reach
that.
i
would
like
to
go...
to
turn
to
the
legislative
history
on
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
would
think
that
ordinarily
we
would...
we
would...
because
the
relationship
between
prospective
employees
in
the
federal
government
is
one
of
federal
law,
that
we
would
ordinarily
be
limited
to
federal
law,
although
conceivably
federal
law
might
borrow
a
state
statute
or
principle
on
a
particular
case.
but
here
we
are
not
relying
on
a
particular
aspect
of
state
law.
i
think
it...
with
respect
to
the
argument
on
the
legislative
history,
i
think
it
is
critical
to
point
out
several
important
defects
in
what
the
petitioners
rely
on
in
the
legislative
history
in
1962.
first
of
all,
the
phrase
being
a
government
official
or
employee
in
the
first
paragraph
of
section,
then
1914,
was
specifically
dropped
from
the
statute
at
that
point.
and
congress
had
two
purposes...
congress
did
two
things.
it
both
defined
that
phrase
more
precisely
to
be
limited
to
executive
employees
only,
which
is
the
only
purpose
the
petitioners
mentioned,
but
they
also
did
something
else.
they
deleted
it
entirely
and
put
the
reference
to
the
types
of
employees
further
down
in
the
first
paragraph,
referring
only
to
the
time
of
the
performance
of
the
services.
they
did
not
leave
the
reference
to
government
officials
in
there
twice.
they
deleted
it
the
first
time
it
appeared.
that
is,
by
the
way,
precisely
what
congress
did
when
it
modified
the
former
section
281,
now
section
<two
oh
three>
[=
203],
which
bars
the
receipt
of
compensation
for
services
performed
for
someone
outside
the
government
while
you
are
a
government
employee.
congress
also
deleted
the
phrase
"being
a
government
official"
right
at
the
same
place
in
the
statute
and
moved
down
further
in
the
statute
the
specification
of
the...
of
the
precise
categories
of
employees
that
are
covered.
and
as
the
legislative
history
shows,
that
was
done
for
the
specific
purpose,
and
the
staff
report
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
says
this,
it
was
done
for
the
specific
purpose
of
making
clear
that
the
time
of
the
receipt
of
the
payment
did
not
matter.
that
it
was...
at
the
time
that
the
services
were
performed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
was
done
at
the
same
time
in
1962,
and
the
precise
phrase
was
dropped
from
both
places.
mr.
lacovara
says
that
the,
relies
on
the
phrase
203
and
the
fact
that
section
203
covers
members
of
congress
elect.
the
fact
is
that
the
predecessor
statute
had
precisely
the
same
coverage.
it
contained
the
word,
and
this
is
important,
it
contained
the
phrase
"to
be
rendered",
the
very
phrase
he
relies
on,
and
it
also
covered
members
of
congress,
even
before
they
qualified,
or
after
they
have
qualified
for
office,
even
if
they
haven't
taken
it.
so
it
was
not
the
phrase
"to
be
rendered"
that
covered
employees,
persons
before
they
became
employees.
it
was
the
deletion
of
the
same
phrase
that
was
deleted
here
that
resulted
in
the
coverage
of
persons
before
they
enter
into
government.
and
in
fact
at
page
61
of
the
staff
report,
which
again
formed
the
basis
for
the
statute,
the
staff
report
states
that
this
language
dealing
with
government
officials
or
employees
was
modified
to
conform
its
scope
to
section
281
as
the
staff
report
proposed
to
revise
it,
which
would
have
covered
all
three
branches
but
also
would
have
revised
it
to
apply
only
when,
in
that
case,
when
the
services
are
performed,
not
when
the
payments
are
received.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
[inaudible]
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
staff
report
of
the
judiciary
subcommittee,
which
the
legislative
history
shows
was
the
principal
basis
on
which
the
revision
was...
the
1962
revision
was
based.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
will
get
the
opinions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
are
justice
department
opinions,
and
i
will
furnish
them
to
the
court.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
also,
i
should
point
out
that
the
consistent
position
of
the
office
of
legal
counsel
and
of
the
office
of
government
ethics
has
been
that
the
statute
applies
to
payments
made
prior
to
the
time
that
a
person
enters
into
government
service,
which,
after
all,
is
consistent
with
the
position
that
the
justice
department
had
taken
under
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the...
in
1974
in
the...
are
the
first
times
with
respect
to
the
opinions
that
we
cited
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief.
but
it
goes
back
to
1961
in
the
memorandum
under
the
prior
statute.
