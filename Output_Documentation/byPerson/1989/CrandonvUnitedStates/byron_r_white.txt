how
did
the
statute
ever
get
into
the
case?
justice
white
was
measured?
justice
white
mr.
kneedler,
is...
is
it
correct,
as
mr.
lacovara
said,
that
you
concede
that
the
two
paragraphs
of
209(a)
are
coextensive?
that
is
to
say
that
no
one
can
be
liable
for
making
the
payment
under
the
second
paragraph...
put
it
the
other
way.
no
one
can
be
liable
for
receiving
the
payment
under
the
first
paragraph
unless
the
person
making
the
payment
would
also
be
liable
under
the
second
paragraph.
justice
white
well,
why...
so
it
is
a
civil
cause
of
action
under
the
common
law?
justice
white
then
why
do
you
say
the...
why
do
you
say
the
disclosure
element
of
the
common
law
doesn't
apply
here?
justice
white
and
you
say
because
it
doesn't
say
it,
disclosure
doesn't...
won't
help
any.
justice
white
how
about
the
common
law
action
you
bring,
except
for
the
statute,
you
say
disclosure
would
have
cured
the
common
law--
justice
white
--well,
suppose
it
was.
justice
white
i
would
think...
i
would
think
the
statute
ought
to
say
that
disclosure
won't
cure
this
crime.
justice
white
that
isn't
what
i
asked.
had
they
agreed
to--
justice
white
--well,
formally
or
otherwise,
they
hadn't
agreed,
they
hadn't
agreed
to
it.
justice
white
well,
if
one
of
them
had
gotten
run
over
by
a
truck
after
this
so-called
understanding,
do
you
think
boeing
could
have
recovered
the
money?
justice
white
so
you
figure
if
one
of
them
had
just
said
well,
i've
decided,
i've
got
a
better
offer
from
some
other
company,
they
could
have
recovered
the
money?
justice
white
yes
or
no?
justice
white
well,
could...
i
take
it
the
person
who
changes
his
mind,
goes
to
work
for
the
other
company,
he
could
be
convicted
under
this
statute,
and
so
could
his
employer
who
paid
him
the
money?
justice
white
when
was
that,
when
was
that
position
first
taken?
