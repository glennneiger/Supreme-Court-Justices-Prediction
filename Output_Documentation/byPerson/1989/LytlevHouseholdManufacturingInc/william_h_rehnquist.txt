chief

william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
88-334,
john
s.
lytle
v.
household
manufacturing,
inc.--
ms.
reed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
reed,
these
were
findings
in
connection,
of
the
sort
that
are
ordinarily
made
in
connection
with
a
bench
trial,
findings
of
fact?
chief
justice
rehnquist
interlocutory
appeal
under
1292(b)
by
certification?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
mean
you
can
appeal,
you
can
appeal
from
the
judgment
entered
against
you
and
assign
that
as
a
ground
of
error.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
reed.
mr.
dennard.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
argued
it
before
the
fourth
circuit?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
certiorari
papers
in
this
case
were
filed
before
we
heard
and
decided
patterson
on
rehearing,
weren't
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
granted
certiorari
on
the
question
of
whether
the
violation
of
the
seventh
amendment
was...
at
what
time
it
should
be
reviewed
on
the
question
presented
by
the
petitioner's
question.
and
if
you
are
asking
us
to
decide
the
case
on
a
ground...
kind
of
an
alternative
basis
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
decided
it
on,
you
really
have
to
show
us
some
reason
why
we
ought
not
to
reach
that
question,
don't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i...
the
seventh
amendment,
obviously,
is
a
provision
of
the
constitution,
and
it
guarantees
the
right
to
jury
trial
in
a
civil
case.
but
what
we
are
talking
about
here
is
how
a
decision
claimed
to
have
wrongfully
denied
that
right
should
be
reviewed,
and
collateral
estoppel,
and
that's...
now,
those
aren't
necessarily
constitutional
questions.
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
if
you
are
right
about
the,
this
being
a
constitutional
claim
that
the
petitioner
has
raised,
i
don't
think
that
the
avoidance
of
constitutional
claims
is
something
that
we
pay
much
attention
to
and
a
question
where
we
have
granted
certiorari
on
the
question.
we
could
grant
certiorari
on
a
very
important
constitutional
question
that
we
think
there
is
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
on
that
needs
decided.
the
respondent
could
come
in
and
say
well,
look,
you
could
decide
this
on
a
statutory
ground.
our
answer
in
the
past
has
been
we
don't
want
to.
we
choose
to
decide
the
case,
if
we
can,
on
the
basis
that
the
petitioner
has
presented.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
certainly
have
a
right
to
present
them.
but
you
do
have
some
burden,
i
think,
to
persuade
us
that
we
ought
to
go
that
way
and
more
or
less
abandon
the
question
which
we
granted
certiorari.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
parklane
was
two
different
suits,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
mean
by
a
good-faith
dismissal?
i
would
assume
that
most...
in
fact
i
can...
it
is
hard
to
conceive
of
a
district
court
dismissing
an
action.
even
though
it's
erroneous,
it
was
not
done
in
good
faith.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
under
rule
41,
the
trier
of
fact
is
entitled
to
weigh
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
and
make
those
sort
of
determinations
that
the
trier
isn't
entitled
to
make
under
rule
50,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
this
was
after
a
bench
trial
on
the
title
vii
action?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why,
why
would
a
district
court
be
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
the
kind
of--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
but
you...
the
district
court
wasn't
engaged
in
that
sort
of
an
inquiry,
was
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
are
asking
us
now
to
reweigh
the
evidence
and
to...
or
to
weigh
the
evidence,
decide
that
you
should
have
gotten
a
motion
for
a...
for
dismissal
or
summary
judgment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
we
don't
ordinarily
make
that
sort
of
determination
here.
did
the
court
of
appeals
make
that
determination?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dennard.
ms.
reed,
you
have
18
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
reed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
