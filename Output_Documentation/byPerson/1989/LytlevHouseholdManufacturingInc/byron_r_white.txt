justice
white
this
is
a
ground
that
you
think
you
are
entitled
to
press
as
a
respondent?
justice
white
but
you,
did
you--
justice
white
--have
you
cross-petitioned?
justice
white
well,
isn't
this
different
relief
than
you...
than
you
got
below?
justice
white
well,
had
patterson
been
decided
then?
justice
white
but
you
nevertheless
were
arguing
that
point?
justice
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
that.
justice
white
well,
what
was...
the
court
of
appeals
ruled
on
collateral
estoppel,
didn't
it?
justice
white
well,
that
certainly
is
different
than
saying
1981
doesn't
cover
this.
justice
white
it
may
be
in
result...
it
may
be
in
result
that
you,
that
there
just
isn't
any
1981
claim
for
one
reason
or
another.
but
it
isn't
the
same
reason.
justice
white
as
long
as
it
doesn't
give
you
more
relief
than
you
would
have
had.
justice
white
all
right.
so,
yeah.
justice
white
well,
was
there
ever
a
denial
of
the
motion
for
new
trial,
in
so
many
words?
i
mean,
for
a
jury
trial,
in
so
many
words?
justice
white
all
there
was
was
a
dismissal.
justice
white
well,
but
aren't
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
or
not?
justice
white
well,
but
then
on
appeal
the--
justice
white
--why
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
you
don't
claim
that
the...
you
don't
claim
that
the
correctness
of
the
dismissal
of
the
1981
suit
wasn't
appealable?
justice
white
that
is
reviewable
in
that
case...
in
this
case.
it
was
reviewable
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
and
it
was
all
part
of
one
suit.
justice
white
it
isn't...
wasn't
two
different
suits,
though,
was
it?
justice
white
but
you
say
because
there
were
two...
because
there
were
two
counts
in
the...
two
counts
in
this
complaint,
collateral
estoppel
applies,
whereas
if
it
had
just
been
a
1981
suit
which
was
lost,
then--
justice
white
--well,
i
know,
but
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
court
says
well,
we
agree,
the
trial
judge
arrived
at
exactly
the
right
conclusions
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
but
we
have
to
reverse.
there
is
no
collateral,
no
estoppel,
because
it
should
have
been
tried
by
a
jury.
justice
white
do
you
think
that
would
be
the
routine
result
if...
suppose
the
trial
judge
here
said...
said
well,
i
think
you
state
a
good
cause
of
action
in
both
1981
and
19...
and
title
vii.
i
am
going
to
try
the
title
vii
claims
first.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
if,
what
if
he
had
said
that?
it
violates
beacon,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
then
it
would
not
be
collateral
estoppel.
