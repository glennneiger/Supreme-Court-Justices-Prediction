wouldn't
you
have
to
amend
to
get
under

your
original
pleadings.

that
the

justice

issue.

xxx.
justice
marshall
i
see.
but
just
the
same.
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
first
case,
lytle
versus
household
manufacturing
company
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
district
court’s
resolutions
of
the
issue
in
the
acts
of
a
claim
does
not
bar
relitigation
before
a
jury
of
the
same
issue
and
a
legal
claim.
we,
therefore,
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit
and
remand
for
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
joins.
