mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
may
disagree
with
some
of
what
the
petitioner
said
about
the
background
facts
in
the
case,
but
we
don't
believe
there
is
any
disagreement
about
what
mr.
lytle's
claims
are,
and
we
feel
that
the
claims
themselves
are
important
for
the
court's
initial
consideration.
mr.
lytle
claims
that
he
was
discriminated
against
because
of
his
race
when
he
was
terminated
for
violating
the
company's
rule
on
unexcused
absences.
he
next...
in
other
words,
he
claims
the
discriminatory
application
of
a
company
rule
or
policy.
next,
mr.
lytle
claims
that
he
was
retaliated
against
or
discriminated
against
because
he
filed
an
eeoc
charge
when
the
company
gave
out
references
to
perspective
employers
that
included
only
the
job
title
and
length
of
employment.
again,
we
are
talking
about
the
discriminatory
application
of
a
company
policy,
and
in
this
instance
the
alleged
basis
of
discrimination
is
the
fact
that
mr.
lytle
filed
an
eeoc
charge.
from
the
very
start
of
this
case
schwitzer
has
taken
the
position
that
both
claims,
retaliation
claim
and
the
discharge
claim
under
section
1981,
should
be
dismissed
because
title
vii
covers
this
conduct.
this
is
an...
important
for
the
court
to
consider
initially
because
the
court
can
avoid
the
constitutional
issue
that
is
urged
by
the
petitioner
by
considering
the
application
of
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
patterson
to
this
case.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
we
do,
your
honor,
because
we
feel
like
we
have
raised
the
issue
below,
and
that's
what
we
intend
to
argue,
and
that--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--certainly
records
adequately
developed--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well,
this
is...
of
course
patterson
was
decided
after
that,
but
it
is
our
position
that
we
adequately...
raised
these
issues,
as
far
as
the
coverage
of
section
1981,
so
that
we
can
make
this
argument
at
this
stage.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
we
argued
before
the
fourth
circuit
and
in
the
district
court
that...
that
the
retaliation
claim...
it's
a
little
bit
different
argument
with
both
claims.
but
with
the
retaliation
argument,
we
specifically
argued
that
section
1981
does
not
cover
retaliation.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
patterson
hadn't
been
decided
then.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
we
were
arguing
the
point,
and
what
our
position
here
today
is
is
that
we
have
developed
the
record
on
that
and
that
we
have
adequately
raised
pat...
the
issues
that
are
covered
by
patterson--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
rule
on
that.
they
ruled
on
another
grounds,
but
they
did
not
specifically
reject
that,
your
honor.
they...
i
think
they
mention
in
the
decision
that
they
will
not
rule
on
the
other
grounds
that
were
presented
by
both
sides.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
that's...
well,
the
relief
from
the
standpoint
of
section
1981
not
covering
discharge
and
retaliation
would
be
the
same.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well,
we
would
contend,
your
honor,
that
as--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--well,
we
would
contend,
your
honor,
that
as
an
appellee
we
would
have
the
right
to
defend
on
any
matter
that
was
raised
in
the
record.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
relief
would
be
the
same.
i
mean,
we
are
talking
about--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--the
additional...
the
additional
point
is
that...
this
consideration
of
an
appellee
relying
on
matters
that
are
developed
in
the
record,
or
raised
in
the
record,
is
even
stronger
when
there
is
an
intervening
decision
like
the
patterson
case.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
amend?
i
don't
understand.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well,
we
feel
that
we
would
have
a
right
to
present
the
issue
at
this
point
in
time
to
the
supreme
court
because
we've
raised
the
issue
below
and
because
the
record
is
adequately
developed
to
consider
it,
without
any
amendment.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well,
we
didn't
raise
the
patterson
issue--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--per
se.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
but
we
took
the
position
that
section
1981
could
not
be
added
to
title
vii
claims
in
this
case
for
both
discharge
and
retaliation,
and
the
section
1981
claims
were
dismissed
based
on
that
argument.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
that
is
correct.
given
the
status
that
we're...
of
the
record
that
we
have,
we
feel
that
we
stand
in
a
better
situation
than
someone
simply
arguing
the
retroactive
application
of
patterson,
although
i
think
it's
clear
that
patterson
should
apply
retroactively,
because...
and
that
has
been
the
majority...
that
has
been
the
result
in
the
big
majority
of
cases
that
have
considered
it
in
the
lower
courts.
the
sixth,
the
seventh,
the
ninth
and
the
eleventh
circuits
have
all
applied
patterson
retroactively
to
pending
claims
at
this
point
in
time.
we
cite
the
ninth
circuit
or
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
in
our
brief,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
decision
in
mcginnis
v.
ingrahm
equipment
company
is
at
888
f.
2d
at
111,
considered
the
application
of
patterson
to
a
pending
case
and
considered
the
plaintiff's
argument
in
that
case
that
patterson
couldn't
be
raised
because
it
hadn't
been
perfected
on
appeal.
and
the
eleventh
circuit
concluded
that
patterson
would
have
to
be
considered
because
it
actually
restricted
the
subject
matter
of
the
court
to
consider
claims
under
section
1981.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well,
the
point...
the
reason
not
to
reach
that
question
is
because
it,
you
have
to
consider
a
constitutional
question
there.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
the
constitutional
question
is
the
seventh
amendment
right
to
a
jury
trial.
that's...
the
question
that
was
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari,
it
was...
that's
the
way
it
was
grounded.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well,
that
is
the
view
that
we've
taken,
and
that's
the
grounds
for
the
court
considering.
and
of
course
the
other
basis
is
because
we
feel
like
we
have
raised
the
issue
and
the
record
is
adequately
developed
so
that
we
can
have
the
issue
considered
under...
under
those
principles.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
there
was...
what
there
was--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--a
dismissal
of
the
section
1981
claim,
which
carried
with
it
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well,
we
have
the
additional
course,
your
honor,
we
feel
like
we
have
developed
the
issue
and
that
the...
the
record
is
adequately
developed.
and
as
an
appellee
we
have
a
right
to
present
those
grounds.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well,
the
additional
basis
would
be
the
argument
that
we
have
with
the
avoidance
of
deciding
the...
a
question
with
constitutional
dimensions
to
it.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
under...
of
course,
under
the
reasoning
in
patterson,
some
promotion
decisions
would
be
subject
to
coverage.
but
i
don't
think
the
promotion
issue
has
really
been
preserved
up
the
line.
in
patterson
the
court
really
considered
the
question
of
the
overlap
coverage
between
section
1981
and
title
vii
and
concluded
that
there
could
be
a
rational,
common
sense
interpretation
of
the
language
of
section
1981
to
make
and
enforce
contracts
that
would
yield
an
interpretation
that
wouldn't
frustrate
the
congressional
objective
to
the
preference
of
conciliation
over
litigation
in
title
vii
cases.
and
with
the...
they
looked
at
the...
the
court
looked
at
the
terminology
to
make
and
enforce
contracts,
and
to
make
a
contract
extends
only
to
the
formation
of
a
contract,
and
not
to
subsequent
conduct,
like
the...
even
if
it
amounts
to
the
breach
of
a
contract
or
the
imposition
of
discriminatory
working
conditions.
the
right
to
enforce
contracts,
on
the
other
hand,
would
extend
to
the
legal
process
and
protection
of
the
legal
process.
so
our
position
on
the
patterson
case
would
be
that
we
would
urge
the
court
to
apply
patterson
in
this
case
to
uphold
the
dismissal
of
both
the
retaliation
and
the
discharge
claims,
because
this
is
post-formation
conduct.
the
discharge
is
obviously
post-formation
conduct.
it
actually
involves
the
discriminatory
application
of
rules.
it's
very
analogous
to
the
situation
in
patterson
where
we
were
talking
about
alleged
discriminatory
working
conditions,
harassment,
sweeping
the
floor
and
this
type
thing.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well,
that...
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
we
feel
that
we
have
adequately
developed
these
issues
along,
that
would
give
us
a
right
to
have
that
considered
at
this
point
in
time.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well,
the...
the
question
of
collateral
estoppel
doesn't
even
come
into
play
unless
you
assume
that,
the
error
in
the
case.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well,
in
that
situation
you
would
have
to
consider
the
constitutional
question
and
consider
the--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--we
are.
we
are.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
i
believe
you
have
power
to
do
that.
if
the
court
does
consider
the...
if
the
court
does
consider
the
collateral
estoppel
issue,
or
if
it
is
addressed,
we
urge
the
court
to
uphold
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
that
mr.
lytle
was
collaterally
estopped
from
relitigating
issues
under
his
section
1981
claim.
and
reaching
the
result
that
the
fourth
circuit
reached,
they
relied
on
an
earlier
decision,
in
that
case
in
ritter
v.
saint
mary's
college.
and
in
that
case
there
had
been
dismissal
of
age
discrimination
act
and
equal
pay
claims
that
were
combined
with
title
vii
claims,
and
this
is
the
decision.
the
ritter
decision
really
contains
the
rationale
that
the
fourth
circuit
has
for
applying
collateral
estoppel.
the
fourth
circuit
looked
at
the
conflict
that
was
involved,
on
the
one
hand
the
denial
of
the
plaintiff's
right
to
have
his
issues
relitigated
before
the
jury,
and
on
the
other
hand
the
policy
as
to
underlying
collateral
estoppel,
the
economic...
economical
resolution
of
cases,
and
concluded
that
park...
this
court's
decision
in
parklane
hosiery
had
already
tipped
the
scales
in
favor
of
applying
collateral
estoppel--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--that
would...
we
would
submit
that
would
be
a
different
situation,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
on
appeal
then
that
could
be
reversed,
but
that
is
not
our
situation.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
because
our
situation
is
the
situation
where
you
have
section
1981
claims
combined
with
title
vii
claims.
the
section
1981
claims
were
dismissed.
there
is
a
good-faith
dismissal
of
those
claims.
and
the
courts,
faced
with
title
vii--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--we
don't
claim;
we
realize
that--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
but
it's
still
a
different
situation--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--no,
not
two
different
suits,
but
it
is--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--parklane
was
two
different
suits.
and
the
fourth
circuit
looked
at
that,
and
that
was
of
course
the
argument
that
the
plaintiff
made
in
the
ritter
case,
that
this
was
different
because
there
is
a
separate
suit
involved.
and
the
fourth
circuit
reasoned
that
the
separate
suit
really
didn't
make
a
difference
because
that
was
just
because
collateral
estoppel
[inaudible]--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--if
it
was
just
a
1981
suit
and
the
court
proceeded
to
just
try
that
case
before
the
court,
without
a
jury
trial,
then
that
would
be
a
direct
violation
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
and
it
would
be
subject
to--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--well,
that's
the
only...
the
distinction
we
have
is
that
we
have
two
different
claims
involved.
and
in
our
case
it
is
not
a
situation
where
there
is
a
direct
denial
or
trying
of
an
issue
before
the
court
that
should
be
considered
by
the
jury.
it
was
a
situation
where
the
legal
claims
were
dismissed
and
they
were...
there
were
pending
equitable
claims
remaining
that,
under
title
vii,
that
required
the
court
to
proceed
with
a
bench
trial.
in
the
separate
suit
type
argument,
too,
another
point
to
make
would
be
that
parklane
specifically
recognized
that
the
major
premise
with
beacon
theatres
is
that...
is
a
rule
that
unless
legal
claims
are
tried
first,
prior
to
equitable
claims,
then
the
judge's
factual
findings
on
the
equitable
claims
would
collaterally
estop
the
jury's
redetermination
of
these
issues.
and
the
two
quotes
that
we
would
like
to
point
out,
or
two
portions
of
the
opinion
in
parklane
that
establish
that...
this
premise
is
established
by
the
following
language
that
is
in
parklane
at
page
334.
recognition
that
an
equitable
determination
could
have
collateral
estoppel
effect
in
a
subsequent
legal
action
was
the
major
premise
of
this
court's
decision
in
beacon
theatres.
and
then
quoting
the
court's
earlier
decision
in
katchen
v.
landy,
both
beacon
theatres
and
dairy
queen
recognize
that
there
may
be
situations
in
which
the
court
could
proceed
to
resolve
the
equitable
claims
first,
even
though...
even
though
the
results
may
be
dispositive
of
the
issues
involved
in
the
legal
claims.
so
certainly
parklane
and
katchen
establish
that
beacon
theatres
rule
that
normally
equitable
or
legal
claims
should
be
tried
first
as
a
general
prudential
rule,
and
that
an
equitable
determination
can
have
collateral
estoppel
effect
in
subsequent
legal
proceeding--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--well,
that
wouldn't
be
our
case.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
i
believe
it
would.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
because
it
violated
the
beacon
principle.
but
that's
not
our
situation,
the
distinction
that
we
have.
we
are
not
a
situation
in
which
there
is
a
direct
violation
of
the
right
to
jury
trial,
that...
we
have
a
situation
where
the
district
court
judge
made
a
good-faith
dismissal
of
legal
claims
and
was
faced
with
a
statute
that
required
the
court's
determination
before
the
bench.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well,
the
petitioner
claims,
i
think,
that
the
judges,
district
court
judges,
would
be
inclined
to
dismiss
legal
claims
based
on
administrative
and
personal
convenience,
which
we're
distinguishing
it
certainly
from
that
situation.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well,
we
agree
that
it
is
not,
you
know,
directly
within
parklane,
that
it's...
but
within
the
rationale
of
parklane.
from
the
standpoint
of
the
harm
involved,
though,
i
mean,
the
defendants
in
parklane
were
denied
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
the
same
as
we
have
in
our
situation.
to
summarize
the
argument
or
conclude--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--well,
that
would
fly
right
in
the
face
of
several
decisions
that...
that
[inaudible].
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
to
conclude
on
parklane,
our
position
would
be
that
in
parklane
the
court
found
that
the
defendants
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
their
claims
in
the
prior
lawsuit,
and
that
they
were
therefore
collaterally
estopped
from
relitigating
factual
issues
in
a
second
lawsuit.
the
court
found
that
this
application
of
collateral
estoppel
did
not
violate
the
seventh
amendment.
likewise,
mr.
lytle
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
his
claims
in
the
title
vii
proceedings.
from
the
standpoint
of
looking
at
the
principles
of
judicial
economy,
the
same
principles
that
applied
in
parklane
apply
here,
the
dual
purpose
of
protecting
litigants
from
relitigating
an
identical
issue
and
of
promoting
judicial
economy
by
preventing
needless
litigation.
to
summarize
our
final
argument,
it's
clear
that
the
court
need
not
address
the
collateral
estoppel
issue
if
a
directed
verdict
would
have
been
proper,
since
the
dismissal
of
the
1981
claim
in
that
situation
would
have
constituted
harmless
error.
we
realize
that
the
standards
are
different
for
a
rule
41(b)
motion
and
that
there
is
some
weighing
of
the
evidence
that
is
allowed
there,
but
the
standard
for
directed
verdict
would
include
a
situation
where
there
is
an
absence
of
proof
on
an
issue
material
to
the
cause
of
action.
with
both
the
discharge
claim
and
the
retaliation
claim,
the
district
court
judge
ruled
that
the
defendant,
or
the
plaintiff
did
not
establish
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
we
recognize
that
there
is
a
difference
in
those
standards,
and...
but
our
position
would
be
that...
that
we
met
the
directed
verdict
standard
in...
by
what
the
judge
really
did.
he
ruled
that
as
a
matter
of
law
the
plaintiff
did
not
establish
a
prima
facie
case
in
either
situation.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well,
he
didn't...
the
district
court
didn't
say
that,
your
honor,
we
say--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--that
the
evidence
that
was
presented
would
meet
that
standard.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
well
that,
you
know,
even
the
circuits
courts,
like
hussein,
that
apply
the
opposite
rule
in
this
situation,
would
look
at
the
evidence
to
determine
if
it
would
have
in
fact
gone
to
the
jury.
and
that
is
what
we
are
asking--
mr.
h.
lane
dennard,
jr.
--no.
no,
sir.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
argument.
