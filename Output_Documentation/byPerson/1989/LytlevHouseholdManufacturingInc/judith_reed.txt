mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
john
lytle
filed
a
complaint
in
federal
district
court
alleging
that
he
had
been
fired
for
racially
discriminatory
reasons
and
that
the
respondent
employer
had
subsequently
retaliated
against
him
for
racially
discriminatory
reasons.
petitioner
sued
under
both
1981
and
title
vii.
his
complaint
therefore
alleged
both
legal
and
equitable
claims.
he
made
a
timely
demand
for
a
jury
trial.
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
those
legal
claims,
the
district
court
dismissed
the
section
1981
claims
on
reasons
that
everyone
concedes
were
erroneous
and
proceeded
to
trial
on
the
equitable
claims,
ruling
against
petitioner
and
in
favor
of
respondent.
respond...
petitioner
subsequently
attempted
to
correct
that
error
in
the
court
of
appeals.
while
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
it
was
error
to
dismiss
the
1981
claims,
it
found
that
it
was
powerless
to
reverse
and
remand,
for
it
held
that
the
judge's
findings,
if
not
clearly
erroneous,
could
collaterally
estop
petitioner
from
litigating
his
claims
before
a
jury.
thus,
the
import
of
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
because
the
district
court
proceeded
to
make
findings,
his
original
error
in
denying
a
jury
trial
was
unreviewable,
meaning
therefore
that
orders
denying
the
jury
trial
are
not
reviewable
after
trial.
ms.
judith
reed
the
findings
on
title
vii.
there
were
findings
of
fact
on
whether
title
vii
had
been
violated.
the
issue
in
this
case,
then,
is
at
what
point
a
party
is
entitled
to
appeal
an
improper
denial
of
a
jury
trial.
under
the
view
of
the
respondent,
and
apparently
in
the
view
of
the
fourth
circuit,
petitioner
lost
his
right
to
appeal
that
order
denying
a
jury
trial
on
the
first
day
of
trial
when
that
demand
was
extinguished
and
the
bench
trial
begun.
such
a
holding
has
serious
consequences
for
both
litigants
and
the
federal
courts,
for
if
a
party
is
in
danger
of
losing
his
right
to
a
jury
trial,
he
must
proceed
by
mandamus
or
take
an
interlocutory
appeal.
such
an
order
would
now
fall
within
the
confines
of
the
cohen
doctrine,
addressed
by
this
court
in
lauro
lines
v.
chasser
and
midland
asphalt.
the
practice
of
this
court
for
well
over
100
years,
as
we
discuss
in
our
brief,
and
that
of
all
other
circuits,
has
been
to
reverse
and
remand
upon
a
finding
that
the
denial
of
the
jury
trial
right
was
erroneous.
what
the
fourth
circuit
has
done,
in
effect,
is
to
create
a
new
category
of
interlocutory
appeals.
until
now,
one
would
have
thought,
one
had
a
right
to
appeal
that
denial
at
the
conclusion
of
the
proceeding.
indeed,
if
petitioner
had
taken
an
interlocutory
appeal,
under
its
prevailing
view,
it
is
likely
that
such
an
appeal
would
have
been
dismissed.
certainly
petitioner
could
have
proceeded
by
mandamus,
but--
ms.
judith
reed
--well,
either
that
or
because
it
now
fell
within
the
cohen
doctrine,
because
it
would
be
effectively
unreviewable
after
trial,
which
is
what
we
say
the
import
of
the
fourth
circuit's
holding
is.
ms.
judith
reed
i...
we
believe
that
under
the
prevailing
view
of
the
law,
had
he
attempted
to
take
an
interlocutory
appeal,
that
appeal
would
probably
have
been
dismissed
because
it
was
thought
the
jury
trial
orders
were
not
appealable
until
the
conclusion
of
the
trial.
ms.
judith
reed
now,
petitioner
certainly
could
have
proceeded
by
mandamus,
but
he
was
not
required
to
do
so
at
peril
of
forfeiting
his
right
to
ever
appeal
the
denial
of
the
jury
trial.
that
has
simply
never
been
the
law.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
did
this
under
an
erroneous
view
of
collateral
estoppel.
now,
collateral
estoppel
is
not
like
law
of
the
case,
which
is
used
to
maintain
consistency
during
the
proceedings
of
a
single
case.
collateral
estoppel
is
not
applicable
in
the
course
of
a
single
proceeding.
it
is
certainly
not
applicable
on
direct
appeal.
the
fourth
circuit's
use
of
collateral
estoppel
on
direct
appeal
to
preclude
review
of
an
obviously
erroneous
order
is
simply
unprecedented.
now,
collateral,
by
its
terms,
would
appear
to
mean
a
separate
proceeding.
what
the
court
of
appeals
seems
to
have
done
is
some
sort
of
new
kind
of
estoppel
that
one
might
appropriately
term
bootstrap
estoppel.
petitioners
cannot
correct
the
denial
of
the
jury
trial,
according
to
respondent,
because
the
district
court
made
not
one
error
but
two
errors.
it
is
a
somewhat
circular
argument.
it
ends
up
meaning
that
two
wrongs
may
make
a
right,
that
because
the
district
court
proceeded
to
make
findings
after
his
error,
petitioner
cannot
get
review
of
that.
now
the
consequence
of
this
ruling
is
that
a
party
must
seek
and
be
granted
interlocutory
review
of
all
rulings
that
might
possibly
infringe
on
a
right
to
the
jury
trial.
now
that
is
contrary
to
the
federal
system
as
we
know
it,
and
it
would
be
highly
disruptive.
it
raises
the
specter
of
trials
being
ended
before
they
start,
of
counsel
being
required
to
simply
walk
out
of
the
court
room.
and
indeed
such
a
rule
would
not
foster
the
values
of
repose
that
collateral
estoppel
is
designed
to
foster.
it
would,
to
the
contrary,
generate
additional
litigation,
generate
additional
appeals,
because
it
would
force
counsel
to
take
protective
appeals.
now,
respondents
secondly
argue
that
because
the
court
would
have
directed
a
verdict
for
respondent,
a
remand
in
this
case
is
not
required.
now,
our
first
response
to
that
is
that
is
not
what
the
court
of
appeals
held
in
this
case.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold
that
no
reasonable
jury
would
ever
hold
for
petitioner,
or
could
ever
hold
for
petitioner.
the
court
of
appeals
simply
viewed
the
findings
under
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
standard.
second,
the
record
shows
that
there
was
considerable
evidence
on
the...
on
both
the
issues
that
petitioner
raised
to
submit
this
case
to
a
jury.
and
if
the
district
court
could
have
found
for
either
party
there
can't
be
a
directed
verdict.
now,
in
our
briefs
we
cite
several
examples
from
the
record
showing
why
in
this
record
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
submit
the
case
to
a
jury.
the
court
could
grant
a
directed
verdict
only
when
no
reasonable
fact
finder
could
have
decided
for
petitioner.
in
the
instant
case
the
court
decided
the
issues
under
rule
41(b).
and
under
that
rule
the
judge
could
indeed
do
what
he
did.
the
judge
could
make
rulings
on
disputed
testimony.
the
judge
was
free
to
make
inference.
the
judge
was
free
to
decide
whom
he
believed.
but
not
so
under
rule
50.
in
accordance
with
this
court's
decision
in
anderson
v.
liberty
lobby,
the
judge
was
required
to
allow
the
jury
in
this
case,
had
one
been
empaneled,
to
weigh
the
evidence,
make
inferences
and
come
to
a
conclusion
as
to
whether
or
not
petitioner
had
been
discriminated
against.
and
we
think
that
the
trial
judge
indicated
that
by
his
own
words
in
the
trial
transcript,
as
we
point
out
in
our
briefs.
when
petitioner's
counsel
recited
a
view
of
the
evidence
that
could
support
mr.
lytle's
claim,
the
district
court
responded
that
that
was
indeed
a
reasonable
view
of
the
evidence.
that
single
statement,
especially
coupled
with
the
earlier
denial
of
a
summary
judgment
motion,
puts
to
rest
any
claim
that
a
directed
verdict
could
have
been
granted
in
this
case.
what
was
okay
under
rule
41(b)
for
the
judge
to
do,
we
contend,
was...
the
judge
was
precluded
from
doing
under
rule
50(a).
accordingly,
this
court
should
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
a
jury
trial.
you...
in...
indeed,
the
practical
case,
the
practical
issue
in
this
case
is
when
a
party
is
supposed
to
appeal
the
wrongful
denial
of
a
jury.
now,
our
position--
ms.
judith
reed
--well,
if
you
are
referring
to
parklane,
it
is
a
very
different
case,
justice
kennedy.
the
reason...
the
sole
reason
that
petitioner
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
was
because
his
claim...
his
complaint
raised
legal
claims,
and
the
1981
being
that
claim.
the
respondents
don't
pretend
to--
ms.
judith
reed
--the
judge...
we
contend
the
judge
erred,
and
indeed
all
parties
agree
that
the
district
judge
erred
in
dismissing
the
1981
claims.
the
1981
claims
were
what
brought
into
play
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
by
dismissing
that
claim
and
the
judge
then
saying
we
will
not
have
a
jury;
we
will
now
proceed
to
trial
in
front
of
the
bench,
that
is...
is
the
denial
of
the
jury
trial.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
begs
the
question
to
decide
that
there
wasn't
explicitly
an
order
striking
a
demand,
as
opposed
to
dismissing
a
claim,
because
it...
you
still
are
left
with
a
category
of
cases
barring
direct
review
of
an
erroneous
decision
of
the
district
court.
now,
we
contend
that
in
this
case
there
is
one
single,
very
important
practical
issue,
and
that
is
when
is
a
party
supposed
to
appeal
the
wrongful
denial
of
a
jury.
now,
our
position
is
clear.
plaintiff
or
defendant,
if
aggrieved
by
the
grant
or
denial
of
a
jury
trial,
can
appeal
that
order
at
the
end
of
trial,
no
matter
what
the
reason
for
the
order.
now
we
don't
understand
what
respondent's
position
is--
ms.
judith
reed
--absolutely.
ms.
judith
reed
that
would
be
our
position,
that
after
the
conclusion,
after
final
judgment
was
entered
on
direct
appeal,
you
could
appeal
any
of
the
errors
that
you
contend
were
made,
including
the
error
denying
the
jury
trial.
now,
we
have
raised
that
issue
in
our
briefs,
and
respondent
has
not
answered
that
question.
and
we
don't
understand
exactly
what
respondent's
position
is.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
judith
reed
respondent
urges
that
this
court
avoid
a
constitutional
issue
by
deciding
on
the
patterson
grounds.
now,
on
that
matter
we
agree
with
the
chief
justice
on
this
question.
whether
an
ordinary
collateral
estoppel
rule
will
prevail
and
a
determination
as
to
when
a
petitioner
may
appeal
the
denial...
the
wrongful
denial
of
a
jury
trial,
does
not
depend
on
the...
the
fact
that
the
jury
trial
right
stems
from
the
constitution.
the
issue
would
be
the
same
whether
it
was
a
statutory
right
to
a
jury
trial
or
that
it
came
from
the
seventh
amendment.
we
think
this
court...
this
question
is
important,
and
the
court
ought
to
decide
the
issue
upon
which
it
granted
cert.--
there
is
the
conflict,
as
the
court
recognized,
between
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
seventh
circuit
on
this
issue.
ms.
judith
reed
well,
oh...
the
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial
is
implicated
here.
my
point
is
that
the...
the
decision
that
this
court
must
make
as
to
the
collateral
estoppel
issue
doesn't
turn
on
that.
we
believe
that--
ms.
judith
reed
--well,
i
think
what
the
court
did
constitutes
a
violation
of
the
seventh
amendment,
don't
get
me
wrong.
however,
the
issue
of
when
a
party
gets
to
appeal
a
wrongful
denial
does
not
turn
on
whether
the,
the
jury
trial
right
stems
from
the
constitution.
so
the...
i
don't
think
you...
the
necessity
for
avoidance
of
a
constitutional...
deciding
on
a
constitutional
issue
is
really
implicated
here.
now,
there
are...
respondents
state
that
they
argued
below
the
same
thing
that
they
raise
here,
that
is
that
retaliation
is
not
covered
under
1981,
for
the
grounds
that
are
set
forth
in
patterson
perhaps.
the
argument
they
made
below
was
a
very
different
one.
now,
we
don't
deny
that
they
can
get
to
raise
the
patterson
questions
on
remand.
we
think
that
would
be
entirely
appropriate
and
that
that
is
what
should
occur.
this
record
is
not
in
the
condition
for
this
court
to
resolve
the
patterson
question.
what
patterson
means
is
that
there
are
fact-specific
issues
that
would
be
appropriately
redressed,
addressed
on
remand,
including
retroactivity
and
including
whether
discharge
and
retaliation
are
within
the
scope.
as
justice
white
pointed
out,
if
we
had
by-passed
title
vii
and
sued
only
under
section
1981,
respondent
would
concede
that
the
denial
of
a
jury
trial
would
have
been
reversible
error.
we
don't
think
the
court
should
adopt
a
collateral
estoppel
rule
that
encourages
or
perhaps
even
requires
a
by-passing
of
title
vii
remedies.
finally,
respondents
urge
that
no
remand
is
necessary
because
of
the
directed
verdict
possibility.
now,
certainly
on
remand,
whether
a
directed
verdict
is
appropriate
can
also
be
considered.
in
closing,
i
would
like
to
state
that
indeed
the
patterson
issues
are
relevant
now
and
they
may
be
raised
by
both
parties
on
remand,
and
we
would
urge
that
this
court
reverse
the
fourth
circuit's
ruling
and
remand
this
case.
ms.
judith
reed
thank
you.
