let
me
just
test
that
out.
you
mean
we
don't
have
the
power
to
reverse
and
send
it
back
and
say
take
a
look
at
this
issue?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
that
if
we
reverse
them
on
the
only
thing
we
granted
cert.
to
decide,
and
we
decide
you
are
wrong
there,
we
could
not
send
the
court
case
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
say
take
a
good
hard
look
at
the
patterson
issue?
you
don't
think
we
have
power
to
do
that?
