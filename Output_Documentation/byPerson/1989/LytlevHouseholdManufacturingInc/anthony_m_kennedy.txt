justice
kennedy
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
under...
you
said
it
is
likely
that
it
would
not
have
been
dismissed?
justice
kennedy
i
see.
justice
kennedy
well,
in
this...
in
this
case
the
judge
didn't
rule
on
the...
on
the
question
of
the
right
to
jury
trial.
his
ruling,
that
you
claim
was
error,
was
that
there
was
no
cause
of
action
at
all.
he
didn't
rule
that
there
was
not
a
jury
trial
if
there
had
been
a
cause
of
action
presented.
so
this
is
not
really
a
case
in
which
we
must
be
concerned
that
the
jury
trial
right
will
be
stifled
because
judges
will
erroneously
rule
that
a
jury
is
not
required.
this
is
just...
there
is,
the
fortuity
here
is
an
erroneous
ruling
of
law
by
assumption.
and
i
don't
see
how
that
is
much
different
than
having
a
previous
hearing
by
the
sec.
justice
kennedy
but
you
see
my
point.
the
judge
didn't
err
in
ruling
that
the
seventh...
in
ruling
on
the
scope
of
the
seventh
amendment.
