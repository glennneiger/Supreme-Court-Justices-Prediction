justice
o'connor
mr.
dennard,
the
petitioner
argues
in
a
brief
that
he
was
wrongfully
denied
a
promotion,
discriminatorily
denied.
now,
would
that
survive
patterson
as
a
section
1981
claim?
justice
o'connor
i
wonder
if
it
wouldn't
be
advisable
to
let
that
question,
the
extent
to
which
patterson
governs
these
particular
claims,
go
back
to
the
lower
courts
in
the
first
instance
and
just
deal
with
the
question
we
thought
we
were
going
to
deal
with
on
certiorari.
