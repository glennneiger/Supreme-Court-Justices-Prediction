justice
scalia
would
the
relief
you
get
under...
under
your
patterson
theory
be
precisely
the
same
as
the
relief
that
you
are
seeking
to
defend?
justice
scalia
i
guess
your
point
is
that
we
have
no
power
to
reverse
the
lower
court
and
to
remand
it,
if...
if
in
fact
the
patterson
issue
should
be
resolved
your
way.
justice
scalia
we
certainly
don't
have
to
reach
patterson,
you
would
acknowledge
this,
if
we...
if
we...
we
don't
have
to
reach
patterson
if
we
find
for
you
on
the
other
point,
on
the
jury
trial
point.
if
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals,
you
would
never
get
to
patterson.
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
you
have
two
points,
and
you
are
not...
you
are
not
separating
them.
your
one
point
is
that
we
ought
to
take
the
patterson
issue
first.
and
that
seems
to
have
met
some...
some
resistance.
your...
you
have
a
second
point,
though,
don't
you,
and
that
is
if
we
don't
take
the
patterson
issue
first,
and
find
against
you,
then
we
must
take
the
patterson
issue,
because
we
have
no
basis
for
reversing
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
scalia
you're
really
arguing
for
something
of
an
extension
of
that
language
in
parklane.
that
language
just
says
that
there
are
some
situations
where
you
can
try
the
equitable
claim
first.
you
are
not
arguing
that
this
is
such
a
situation.
but
you
are
saying
where
it
has
been
mistakenly
tried
first,
the
same
philosophy
that
says
there
are
some
practicalities
that
sometimes
make
it
triable
first
also
dictate
that
that's
water
over
the
dam,
that
it
was
mistakenly
tried
first
and
we
will
give
it
collateral
estoppel
effects.
justice
scalia
but
that
is
an
extension
of
parklane,
of
even
the
dictum
in
parklane.
justice
scalia
the
only
thing
that
makes
that...
that
argument
difficult
is...
and
the
court
keeps
pressing
you
on
this...
i
don't
see
why
it
wouldn't
be
just
as
true
if
the
lower
court
erroneously
denied
a
jury
trial.
you...
surely
you
would
be
able
to
say
the
same
thing.
you
know,
well,
yeah,
they
should
have
done
it
first,
but,
as
parklane
shows,
we
do
take
practical
considerations
into
account--
justice
scalia
--well,
so
did
this
dismissal,
which
is
why
it
was
reversed.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
you
wouldn't
feel
free
to
argue
if
we
came
out
the
wrong
way
on
the
jury
trial
thing,
that
by
denying
you
either
interlocutory
appeal
or
vindication
here
we
have
denied
you
your
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial?
you
don't
think
that
that
constitutional
right
is
involved?
justice
scalia
well,
no...
i
mean,
suppose
we
said
collateral
estoppel
is
perfectly
fine.
wouldn't
we...
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law
and
common
law,
wouldn't
we
then
have
to
say
but,
in
this
area
of
the
sixth
amendment,
isn't
there
some
special
restriction
upon
it?
i
mean,
i
am
just
not
sure
i
agree
with
you
that
you
can
possibly
avoid
saying
that
we
have
to
ultimately
say
would
it
violate
the
sixth
amendment
for
us
to
apply
collateral
estoppel
here.
