justice
o'connor
would
you
explain
why
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
a
reversal
of
his
conviction
or
having
it
set
aside
and
to
get
a
new
trial
is
not
a
substantial
personal
right
under
the
former
texas
law?
justice
o'connor
and
so
why
isn't
that
a
substantial
right
of
the
defendant
to
get
a
new
trial?
justice
o'connor
well,
certainly
under
prior
texas
law
this
sentence
would
have
been
set
aside
and
the
defendant
would
have
had
a
new
trial.
would
you
agree
with
that?
justice
o'connor
and
the
defendant
presumably
could
have
gone
to
court
to
make
sure
that
happened.
justice
o'connor
based
on
the
lack
of
power
of
the
state
court
to
remedy
it.
justice
o'connor
mr.
farrar,
under
the
dobbert
case,
changes
in
sentencing
procedures
that
don't
increase
the
quantum
of
punishment
are
not
thought
to
be
ex
post
facto
laws.
how
do
you
distinguish
this
from
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
here
the
legislature
is
trying
to
eliminate
the
portion
of
the
sentence
that
is
unlawful.
justice
o'connor
if
we
disagree
with
you
and
think
that
what
the
defendant
here
was
seeking
was
basically
a
new
rule,
is
the
claim
barred
under
teague
against
lane?
