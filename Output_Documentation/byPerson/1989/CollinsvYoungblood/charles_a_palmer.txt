mr.
charles
a.
palmer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
statutory
habeas
corpus
case
brought
by
a
texas
state
prisoner.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
ex
post
facto
clause
was
violated
when
the
state
appellate
court
applied
a
statute
that
allowed
it
to
reform
the
judgment
to
delete
an
unauthorized
punishment.
in
1981
carroll
youngblood
abducted
and
sexually
assaulted
a
young
woman.
he
was
tried
the
next
year
upon
his
plea
of
not
guilty,
and
was
found
guilty
of
the
offense
of
aggravated
sexual
assault
by
a
jury.
thereafter,
a
separate
punishment
hearing
was
held
before
the
same
jury,
in
which
the
state
proved
that
youngblood
had
previously
been
convicted
of
a
felony.
the
jury
assessed
punishment
of
life
imprisonment
and
a
$10,000
fine.
following
affirmance
of
his
conviction,
youngblood
filed
a
state
habeas
application
in
which
he
complained
that
the
fine
that
the
jury
assessed
was
not
authorized
by
state
law.
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
agreed
and
granted
relief.
acting
pursuant
to
article
37.10(b)
of
the
texas
code
of
criminal
procedure,
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
reformed
the
judgment
to
delete
the
fine.
youngblood
remains
incarcerated
pursuant
to
the
life
sentence
handed
down
by
his
jury.
texas
law
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
offense
proscribed
the
conduct
in
which
youngblood
engaged
and
provided
that
it
could
be
punished
by
term
of
imprisonment
up
to
and
including
life.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
law
was
changed
to
criminalize
previously
innocent
conduct.
nor
is
it
a
case
in
which
the
range
of
punishment
was
increased
subsequent
to
the
commission
of
the
offense.
there
is
no
question
but
what
youngblood
was
on
notice
at
the
time
he
engaged
in
his
actions
that
they
could
lead
to
the
incarceration
he
presently
is
suffering.
he
cannot
show
an
ex
post
facto
violation
under
the
test
of
calder
v.
bull,
nor
can
he
show
that
he
was
deprived
of
fair
warning
of
the
possible
consequences
of
his
actions.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
your
honor,
we
have
not
briefed
that
issue,
and
we
have
not
chosen
to
rely
on
it.
if
the
court
chooses
to
address
that
without
reaching
the
ex
post
facto
question,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
it
would
be
barred.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
i
understand
it
to
be
jurisdictional,
your
honor.
certainly
if
it
is
not,
well,
then
i
would
think
we
had
waived
it
in
this
case.
but
given
the
conflicting
opinions
of
the
courts
through
which
this
case
has
travelled,
both
state
and
federal,
particularly
the
two
concurring
opinions
in
the
court
of
appeals
below,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
but
what
this
would
be
a
new
rule
under
teague
and
under
butler
v.
mckellar.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
there
are
decisions
of
this
court
that
contain
language
to
the
effect
that
changes
which
are
procedural
in
nature
may
violate
the
clause
if
they
affect
substantial
personal
rights.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
every
case
in
which
the
court
has
found
a
violation
due
to
a
procedural
change,
it
has
fit
within
the
calder
framework
with
two
exceptions.
and
i
think
those
two
exceptions
are
readily
distinguishable.
the
first
of
those
is
thompson
v.
utah,
involving
the
right
to
a
12-person
jury
under
the
constitution.
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
utah
was
a
territory
and
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
the
federal
right
to
trial
by
jury.
at
that
time,
in
1898,
the
court
was
of
the
opinion
that
that
right
embraced
the
right
to
a
12-person
jury.
by
the
time
the
case
was
tried
utah
had
become
a
state
and
had
passed
a
statute
limiting
the
jury
to
eight
persons.
i
think
what
animated
the
court's
decision
in
thompson
was
the
notion
that
the
change
in
law
had
deprived
the
defendant
of
a
right
he
possessed
under
the
federal
constitution.
in
addition
to
that--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--that's
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor.
at
the
time
the
defendant
committed
the
offense
utah
was
not
a
state,
and
he
possessed
that
right
as
a
citizen
of
a
territory.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
in
the
sense
that
the
jury
size
question
in
that
case
was
thought
to
be
inherent
in
the
constitutional
right
to
trial
by
jury.
the
second
case,
i
think,
which
does
not
fit
perhaps
neatly
within
the
calder
framework
would
be
kring
v.
missouri.
that
was
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
pleaded
guilty
to
a
less
included
offense.
missouri
law
provided
that
that
plea
of
guilty
represented
an
acquittal
of
the
greater
offense,
which
would
have
been
a
capital
offense.
i
think...
there
are
two
things
that
can
be
said
about
kring.
one,
it
is
very
doubtful
that
kring
remains
good
law
in
light
of
later
decisions
of
this
court
regarding
the
effect
of
a
guilty
plea
and
withdrawal
of
that
plea.
but
regardless
of
whether
it
does,
in
kring
the
effect
of
the
change
in
law
was
such
that
the
defendant
was
subjected
to
a
death
sentence,
which
was
not
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
offense,
not
in
effect
if
he
had
pled
guilty
to
the
lesser.
so
in
that
sense
kring
represents
a
change
in
law
that
deprived
the
defendant
of
an
absolute
defense
to
punishment.
in
this
case
that
is
not
so.
youngblood
was
sentenced
to
life
imprisonment.
the
result
he
seeks
is
a
reversal
and
the
right
to
a
new
trial,
in
which
he
again
could
be
sentenced
to
a
term
of
life
imprisonment.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
your
honor,
the
court
itself
has
not
interpreted
kring
consistently
since
that
time.
later
cases,
later
decisions
of
this
court
contain
language
to
the
effect
that
kring
represents
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
was
deprived
of
the
right
not
to
be
sentenced
to
death.
but
if
the
court
will
look
at
the
decision
in
kring
itself,
at
page
450,
the
court
says
flat
out
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
the
defendant
was
deprived
of
the
defense.
the
kring
court
characterized
it
as
one
in
which
the
rules
of
evidence
were
altered
so
that
the
prior
plea
of
guilty
and
acquittal
of
the
greater
had
no
force
in
the
second
trial.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
i
think
it
is
quite
questionable,
your
honor.
and
even
if
it
did,
i
think
youngblood's
case
is
readily
distinguishable.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
this
so-called
right
existed
under
texas
law,
i
suggest
the
court
should
defer
to
the
texas
court's
interpretation
of
that
law.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
37.10(b),
the
texas
courts
had
consistently
held
that
in
cases
of
jury
verdict
error,
they
were
powerless
to
fashion
any
remedy
other
than
an
entire
new
trial.
there
is
no
language
in
the
texas
cases
suggesting
that
this
is
a
right
of
the
defendant--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--well,
your
honor,
what
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
is
that
it
was
not
only
not
a
substantial
right,
it
was
no
right
at
all.
it
was
a
question
of
the
authority
of
the
courts,
whether
they
possessed
the
power
to
dispose
of
a
particular
type
of
case
in
a
certain
way.
and
it
was
to
correct
that
lack
of
power
that
the
legislature
enacted
the
statute.
when
the
texas
courts
applied
the
statute
to--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
he
could,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
my
response
is
twofold.
one,
to
the
extent
this
court...
that
this
question
turns
on
texas
law,
i
think
texas
law
is
clear
that
this
was
not
seen
as
a
right
but
rather
as
one
of
a
lack
of
authority.
however,
even
if
the
court
characterizes
it
as
a
right,
or
disagrees
with
the
texas
court's
interpretation,
it
is
far
from
clear
that
prior
texas
law
necessarily
was
advantageous
to
defendants
in
these
type
of
cases.
in
youngblood's
case,
for
instance,
the
permissible
range
of
punishment
was
a
term
of
imprisonment
for
15
years
to
life.
if
youngblood
had
received
a
sentence
at
the
lower
end
of
that
range,
and
had
he
obtained
a
new
trial,
which
is
the
result
he
is
seeking
in
this
case,
he
would
have
exposed
himself
to
a
life
sentence
on
retrial,
a
greater
punishment
than
was...
than
had
been
handed
down
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
your
honor.
the
conviction
would
be
reversed
and
the
state
would
be
free
to
retry
him
again
and
seek
whatever
punishment
was
permissible,
up
to
and
including
life.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
he--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
your
honor,
it
fits
none
of
the
categories
of
calder.
and
i
think
it's
a
common
sense
matter
what
is
important
is
to
remedy
the
harm
that--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--he
may
not
be.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
well,
that
turns,
i
suppose,
on
whether
or
not
he
is
freed
on
bond
pending
the
retrial.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
correct.
this
texas
rule
upon
which
youngblood
relies
applied
only...
the
prior
rule
applied
only
to
jury
sentencing,
which
pierce
controls.
in
cases
where
the
court
assessed
punishment,
the
texas
courts
have
always
been
free
to
reform
the
judgment.
it
is
only
in
cases
of
jury
sentencing
that
the
slate
was
wiped
clean
and
he
was
entitled
to
a
whole
new
trial.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
no,
your
honor.
texas
law
was
that,
in
a
case
such
as
this
where
you
had
a
permissible
punishment,
a
term
of
imprisonment,
and
an
impermissible
one,
this
fine,
and
the
court
was
the
one...
the
sentencer,
the
appellate
court
could
excise
the
fine
and
the
term
of
imprisonment
would
stand.
it
was
only
in
cases
where
the
jury
assessed
punishment
that
prior
texas
law
provided
for
an
entire
new
trial.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
youngblood
relies
on
language
in
weaver
v.
graham
to
the
effect
that
an
ex
post
facto
law
is
one
that
is
retrospective
and
disadvantages
the
defendant.
while
he
is
correct
to
the
extent
that
those
two
elements
must
be
present
for
an
ex
post
facto
violation
to
be
found,
there
is
no
authority
for
the
proposition
that
those
two
factors,
standing
alone,
violate
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
indeed,
if
youngblood
were
correct
on
this
point,
there
would
be
no
basis
for
the
numerous
decisions
of
this
court
to
the
effect
that
procedural
changes
normally
do
not
offend
the
clause.
youngblood
has
characterized
this
case
as
one
in
which
he
was
deprived
a
substantial
personal
right.
the
court
of
appeals
likewise
characterized
the
case.
we
would
suggest
that
that
approach
is
flawed
because
it
ignores
this
court's
admonitions,
most
recently
in
weaver
v.
graham
and
miller
v.
florida,
to
the
effect
that
it
is
the
lack
of
fair
warning,
not
the
concept
of
a
vested
right,
that
is
the
touchstone
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause.
the
amicus
on
behalf
of
youngblood
has
suggested
this
case
is
one
in
which
youngblood
was
deprived
of
an
absolute
defense
to
punishment.
i
think
i
have
made
the
point,
i
would
like
to
make
it
again,
that
that
is
not
the
case,
because,
of
course,
the
state
could
retry
him
and
repunish
him,
and
in
fact
punish
him
more
severely.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
in
this
case
he
could
not,
but
if
his--
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
--but
in
similar
cases
he
could,
your
honor.
in
another
case
he
could.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
he
might
get
less,
he
might
get
more,
he
might
get
acquitted.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that,
as
the
federal
government
has,
the
case
that
is
most
analogous
to
this
is
mallett
v.
north
carolina.
in
that
case
the
court
upheld
the
retrospective
application
of
a
statute
which
provided
the
government
the
right
of
appeal
that
it
did
not
possess
at
the
time
of
the
defendant's
trial.
here,
as
in
mallett,
the
statute
in
question
simply
provided
the
government
with
authority
which
it
did
not
possess
before.
here,
as
in
mallett,
the
prior
lack
of
such
authority
should
not
be
construed
as
the
equivalent
of
a
personal
right.
we
would
suggest
that
youngblood
had
no
more
right
to
have
his
case
disposed
of
in
a
particular
way
than
mallett
did
to
avoid
a
successful
appeal
by
the
government.
if
mallett
is
still
good
law,
and
youngblood
has
not
suggested
that
it
is
not,
it
controls
the
disposition
of
this
case.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
below
for
the
reasons
i
have
offered,
as
well
as
those
stated
in
our
brief
and
the
brief
of
the
federal
government.
mr.
charles
a.
palmer
very
briefly,
your
honor.
youngblood
has
relied
to
some
extent
on
the
language
in
ex
parte
spaulding
to
the
effect
that
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
statute
an
unauthorized
jury
verdict
was
a
nullity
and
voided
in
its
inception.
that
language
must
be
examined
in
light
of
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
subsequently
said
in
ex
parte
johnson.
johnson,
as
you
have
just
been
told,
was
the
first
case
to
come
before
the
court
after
the
statute
was
enacted.
johnson
got
his
judgment
reformed
to
have
the
fine
deleted,
as
did
youngblood.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
discussed
prior
texas
law
under
which
it
had
no
reformation
authority,
and
then
went
on
to
say,
and
i
quote,
in
this
sense
a
judgment
and
sentence
were
considered
void
since
there
was
no
way
to
cure
the
infirmity.
since
these
cases
were
decided,
however,
the
legislature
has
enacted
a
new
law
that
enlarges
the
authority
of
courts
to
reform
judgments,
thus
providing
a
way
to
cure
the
infirmity.
to
the
extent
that
such
verdicts
were
void
under
texas
law,
they
were
void
for
the
reasons
stated
by
the
johnson
court.
indeed,
judge
campbell,
who
was
the
author
of
the
spaulding
opinion,
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
johnson
in
which
he
explained
that
the
only
thing
that
was
truly
void
was
the
unauthorized
fine,
and
that
once
the
statute
was
applied
to
delete
that
fine,
the
remainder
of
the
verdict
was
valid
and
could
be
enforced.
the
only
other
comment
i
would
like
to
make
is
a
lot
of
the
argument
today
has
focussed
on
whether
or
not
youngblood
had
a
right
and
whether
or
not
that
was
a
substantial
right,
and
whether
he
was
harmed
by
the
application
of
the
statute
to
his
case.
well,
i
have
tried
to
convince
the
court
that
this
is
a
case
of
whether
or
not
the
court's
possessed
authority
regardless,
not
whether
it
was
a
right
of
the
defendant.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
is
the
more
fundamental
right
involved
here
is
that
of
a
defendant
to
have
an
error-free
trial.
that
is
exactly
what
youngblood
got.
he
presented
no
evidence
whatsoever
in
the
guilt,
innocence
or
punishment
phases
of
the
trial.
there
is
absolutely
no
suggestion
that
there
was
any
error
affecting
either
phase
of
that
trial.
the
