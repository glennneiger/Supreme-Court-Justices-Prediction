justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question,
your
opponent
and
you
have
been
asked
about
the
application
of
teague
to
the
whole...
this
whole
problem.
and
the
answer,
i
suppose,
is
whether
these
old
cases
are
new
law
or
not
as
to
the
extent
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
out
there
finding
them.
but
may
i
ask
this,
was
the
bogany
case
new
law
as
a
matter
of
texas
law?
justice
stevens
and
of
course,
they
have
since
applied
it
retroactively.
but
had
they
elected
not
to
apply
bogany
retroactively,
you
would
have
no
case.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
if
the
first
time
it
was
decided
they
could
get
their
conviction,
it
was
in
the
johnson
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
what
if
the
day
before
johnson
was
decided
this
legislation
had
been
passed?
would
it
be
retroactive?
say,
we
didn't...
the
issue
had
not
been
resolved
in
the
johnson
case,
but
the
legislature
stepped
in
right
away
and
saw
this
potential
and
said
it
is
okay
to
correct
sentences
by
eliminating
the
fine?
justice
stevens
even
though
we
wouldn't...
never
would
know
how
johnson
was
going
to
be
decided?
i
suppose
that
was...
you
know,
it
was
a
close
case.
