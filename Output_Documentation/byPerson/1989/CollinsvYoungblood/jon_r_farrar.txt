mr.
jon
r.
farrar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
according
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
decision
in
bogany
v.
state,
the
jury's
verdict
in
this
case
was
void
at
its
inception
and
unenforceable.
the
respondent
had
a
fundamental
right
to
reverse
on
new
jury
trial.
the
retrospective
application
of
article
37.10(b)
has
disadvantaged
the
respondent
by
depriving
him
of
the
right
to
reverse
on
new
jury
trial.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
right
to
have
one's
guilt
retried
by
a
different
jury,
with
its
attendant
possibility
that
the
outcome
might
be
different
the
second
time
around,
is
comfortably
encompassed
within
the
category
of
rights
considered
substantial.
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
the
statute
here
is
ex
post
facto.
the
state
of
texas,
however,
seeks
to
enforce
the
judgment,
even
though
it
was
void
when
rendered
as
a
matter
of
texas
law.
the
respondent
is
being
deprived--
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
--i
would
say
it
is
void
in
the
sense
that
in
the
bogany
decision
georgia
said
it
was
void
at
its
inception.
it
was
not
enforceable,
had
absolutely
no
meaning
whatsoever
according
to
texas
law
as
of
that
time.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
that
is
what
the
legislature
is
intending
to
do,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
the
majority
of
the
court
and
the
ex
parte
johnson
case
agreed
that
that
was
okay.
the
dissenting
opinions
disagreed
with
that.
again,
the
respondent
is
being
deprived
of
his
liberty
without
the
benefit
of
a
valid
conviction.
in
miller
v.
florida,
the
court
stated
that
the
test
to
be
employed
to
determine
whether
a
statute
is
ex
post
facto
consists
of
two
major
elements.
it
must
be
retrospective,
and
it
must
disadvantage
the
offender
affected
by
it.
the
court
of
appeals
employed
the
court's
test,
and
found
that
the
statute
here
is
ex
post
facto.
the
state's
argument
does
not
utilize
nor
attempt
to
acknowledge
the
court's
test
as
stated
in
miller,
which
was
following
a
prior
decision
in
weaver.
instead
the
state
insists
that
no
statute
is
ex
post
facto
unless
it
falls
within
one
of
the
four
categories
of
cases
in
calder
v.
bull.
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
has
never
limited
the
ex
post
facto
clause
to
these
four
categories.
in
fact,
justice
chase,
when
he
wrote
the
decision,
he
listed
the
four
categories
and
went
on
to
say
that
all
these
and
similar
laws
are
manifestly
unjust
and
oppressive.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
i
would
use
a
response
written
by
justice
stone
in
beazell
v.
ohio.
and
he
indicated
that,
whether
a
procedural
change
in
the
law,
as
we
have
here,
is
ex
post
facto
would
be
a
matter
of
degree,
keeping
in
mind
that
we
want
to
determine
if
the
individual
is
deprived
of
a
substantial
personal
right.
so
that
is
the
underlying
issue.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
i
think
you
need
to
look
at
whether
utilizing
the
standards
of
the
court
in
a
few
of
the
more
recent
cases
such
as
weaver
v.
graham
and
in
miller
v.
florida,
the
court
indicated
that
we
are
trying
to
determine
whether
the
new
statute
is
more
onerous.
and
i
would
add
one
extra
thing
to
that.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
the
new
statute
is
more
onerous
than
the
old
statute.
but
when
you
look
at
the
case,
or
what
seems
important
in
case
after
case
after
case,
it
is
whether
the
new
law
on
its
face
is
more
onerous.
by
just
looking
at
the
statute
itself,
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
clearly
different
result,
and
it
is
going
to
harm
the
defendant
or
the
respondent,
then...
and
i
want
to
go
beyond
just
the
idea
of
harm,
where
there
is
clearly
depriving
the
respondent
of
the
rights
that
he
had
under
the
old
law,
then
it
is
more
onerous.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
the...
it
depends
on
how
the
statute
is
written,
your
honor.
the
determining
factor,
as
pointed
out
in
the
amicus
brief
on
behalf
of
wilbert
evans,
is
that
if
the
new
statute
is
neutral
in
its
face
and
does
not
deprive
the
defendant
of
any
of
the
basic
rights
that
he
had
under
the
old
law,
and
then
it
is
applied
evenhandedly--
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
--again,
the
attitude
that
i
have
is
that
if
the
statute
is
neutral
on
its
face,
it
is
fine.
it
would
be
admissible.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
again,
i
want
to
focus
on
the
idea
that
you
have
here
that
the
cases
that
this
court
has
ruled
were
okay
to
apply
retrospectively
and
were
not
ex
post
facto
had
the
basic
elements
that
they
were
neutral
on
their
face,
they
were
applied
evenhandedly
to
all
the
parties,
and
if
there
was
a
harm,
it
was
simply
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
it
was
not
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
the
harm
would
result.
in
those
cases
the
statutes
were
okay.
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
cases
where
the
statutes
were
ruled
to
be
ex
post
facto,
in
most
of
those
cases
the
harm
was
obvious
by
looking
at
the
statute
itself.
in
miller
v.
florida,
for
example,
the
presumptive
sentencing
guidelines
had
an
increase
in
the
sentencing.
and
from
the
very
face
of
the
statute
there
was
harm,
it
was
more
onerous,
it
was
ex
post
facto.
the
same
thing
is
true
in
weaver
v.
graham,
where
the
new
statute
on
its
face
had
deprived
the
individuals
of
the
amount
of
gain
time
that
they
had
under
the
previous
statute.
and
then,
again,
the
statute
on
its
face
deprived
these
individuals
of
their
benefits
that
they
had
under
the
old
law.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
i
think
the
way
i
would
distinguish
dobbert
from
the
other
two
cases
is
that
if
the
changes
on
their
face
are
beneficial,
or
the
court
uses
the
term
"ameliorative",
then
the
statute
is
okay.
and
as
the
court
pointed
out,
the
florida
statute
was...
the
florida
legislature
was
trying
to
adopt
additional
protections
for
individuals
that
were
being
charged
with
capital
murder.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
that
is,
of
course,
the
argument
that
the
state
has
taken.
they
have
dropped
the
fine;
it
is
beneficial.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
you
need
to
look
at
the
rights
provided
to
the
defendant
or
the
respondent
under
the
old
law
versus
what
he
has
under
the
new
law.
under
the
old
law,
as
decided
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
the
bogany
decision,
respondent
had
a
right
to
reverse
a
new
trial.
and
then
after
37.10(b)
was
enacted,
he
was
disadvantaged
by
taking
away
that
right.
instead
of
having
his
case
affirmed...
instead
of
having
his
case
reversed
and
a
new
trial
ordered,
he
had
his
case
affirmed.
and
so
what
you
are
looking
at,
the
two
points
you
are
looking
at
is
what
occurred
under
the
old
law
versus
the
new
law,
not
what
should
have
occurred
under
the
old
law
but
did
not
versus
what
occurs
under
the
present
law.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
i
would
have
to
say
basically
the
same
thing
that
the
state
has.
since
they
have
not
discussed
the
teague
decision,
i
have
not
dealt
with
it
particularly
either.
but
there
is
one
point
i
want
to
make,
and
in
texas
law
if
the
court
says
there
is
a
fundamental
error
it
can
be
brought
up
on
an
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
normally
speaking,
if
you
just
have
a
basic
error,
obviously
it
is
a
way
for
purposes
of
habeas
corpus
litigation.
so
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
is
indicating
that
the
type
of
error
here
is
so
extreme
that
it
is
a
fundamental
error,
and
it
can
be
brought
up
at
any
time.
and
another
example
of
that
was
in
the
1985
case
held
out,
or
decided
in
march
in
ex
parte
spaulding.
prior
to
that
the
state
had
attempted
to
utilize
the
governor's
pardon
and
commutation
powers
to
simply
drop
the
fines.
this
was
the
first
scheme
that
the
state
had
to
remedy
the
problems
in
bogany.
but
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
indicated
that
simply
dropping
the
fine
didn't
help
the
matters
any.
the
verdict
was
still
void
at
its
inception.
this
is
a
fundamental
right.
this
was
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
case,
and
it
could
be
dealt
with
now,
and
the
case
was
reversed.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
xxx
fixed
that
all
this
was
fundamental.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
what
seems
strange
in
this
case
is
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
bogany
determined
after
the
respondent
was
actually
convicted
that
this
type
of
right
existed.
and
they
indicated
that
the
type
of
error
was
so
strong
or
so
fundamental
that
he
had
the
right
to
bring
it
up
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
and
so
the
scenario
that
we
have
focuses
on
when
the
right
was
recognized
by
the
court,
and
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
indicated
an
individual
could
do
with
the
right.
if
the
court
said...
if
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
has
said
that
all
that
we
have
here
is
a
basic
error
that
can
be
brought
up
on
direct
appeal,
on
direct
appeal
on
its
way
for
any
other
purpose,
then
we
would
not
have
a
case
here.
but
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
made
it
very
clear
that
this
is
such
a
fundamental
type
of
error
that
it
can
be
brought
up
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
anytime
here
and
out.
and
so
it
is
a
right
defined
by
the--
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
--i
would
not
interpret
the
focus
of
the
bogany
case
in
that
light.
of
course,
judge
teague
has
indicated
when
the
decision
came
out
in
bogany
that
your
scenario
basically
exists.
and
he
regretted
later
on
in
the
johnson
case,
when
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
first
applied
the
37.10(b)
to
this
case,
he
indicated
perhaps
he
opened
up...
i'm
going
to
use,
for
lack
of
better
words...
a
bag
of
worms,
and
suggesting
to
the
legislature
go
ahead
and
make
the
changes.
and
so
there
would
be
precedent
for
what
you
are
saying.
but
i
think,
again,
the
point
is
what
right
existed,
as
interpreted
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals,
under
the
law
in
existence
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
again,
there
was
not
the
right
here
to
impose
the
fine,
and
according
to
the
texas
law
at
that
time,
there
was
a
void
judgment.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
the
particular
error
involved
here
was
first
recognized
in
bogany,
and
in
that
sense
certainly
it
is
new
law.
in
the
sense
that
it
was
consistent
with
texas
traditions
for
a
long
time,
though,
it
was
not.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
that
is
correct.
if
the
court
had
decided
that
there
was
a
waiver
principle,
and
that
we
were
out
of
court
and
went
tough,
then
we
wouldn't
be
here.
there's
a
couple
of
points
where...
about
three
points
i
want
to
focus
on
before
i
close
up.
first
i
want
to
talk
about
mallett
v.
north
carolina.
just
as
the
state
indicated,
the
federal
amicus
brief
focuses
on
this
case
extensively
and
places
all
its
marbles
in
that
case.
basically,
the
respondent
would
suggest
that
what
was
going
on
in
mallett
was
that
under
the
old
law
the
defendant
had
a
superior
right
to
appeal
from
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals
to
the
highest
court
of
appeals.
the
state
did
not
have
that
same
right.
under
the
new
law
the
state
was
given
the
same
right
that
the
defendant
had
previously.
again,
the
statute
on
its
face
was
being
applied
neutrally.
it
was
being
applied
to
both
parties
the
same
way.
they
both
had
the
right
to
appeal
to
the
intermediate...
or
highest
court
of
appeals
from
the
intermediate
court
of
appeals.
and
the
defendant
was
not
being
deprived
of
any
of
his
rights,
unless
one
could
say
that
you
have
a
right
to
keep
the
other
party
from
having
the
same
type
of
rights.
i
would
not
say
that.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
that
is
what
i
was
getting
at
basically,
but
i
do
not
feel
like
it
would
be
a
deprivation
of
the
rights
of
the
defendant.
that
is
going
to
be
arguable,
and
of
course,
the
state,
making
the
best
case
scenario,
would
want
to
make
you
believe
that
somebody
did
not
have
that
sort
of
right
either,
i
guess.
but
my
point
is
that
under
the
new
law,
simply
all
that
happened
is
the
state
was
given
the
same
rights
as
the
defendant,
and
that
was
it.
and
the
defendant
still
wasn't
being
deprived
of
any
of
the
rights
that
he
had
under
the
old
law,
and
in
this
particular
case
we
don't
have
that
at
all.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
that
is
again--
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
that
is
correct.
what
i
have
focused--
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
--again,
i
have
focused
on--
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
--what
i
think
the
court
has
focussed
on
in
its
past
decisions,
though,
is
what
rights
were
defined
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
if
you
have
an
individual
case
that
happens
to
work
to
an
individual's
harm,
and
it
just
happens
to
apply
that
way
in
this
particular
individual
case,
then
that
was
just
the
unfortunate
act
that
occurred
in
that
individual
case.
but
if
the
statute
is
neutral
in
its
face,
then
it
can
be
retrospectively
applied.
but
if
it
is
not
neutral
in
its
face,
if
it
is
on
its
face
clearly
detrimental,
clearly
more
onerous,
then
it
is
ex
post
facto.
and
that
is
the
distinction
i
would
make
in
most
of
the
cases
where
relief
was
granted
or
not
granted,
whether
the
statute
on
its
face
was
more
onerous
or
not.
i
also
want
to
talk
about
part
of
the
government's...
u.s.
government's
comment
that
bogany
is
simply
a
windfall
for
the
respondent.
in
actuality,
if
article
37.10(b)
is
allowed
to
be
applied
retrospectively,
the
real
windfall
would
be
for
the
state,
because
the
state
would
be
allowed
to
enforce
a
judgment
that
was
otherwise
void
according
to
the
law
in
bogany...
or
according
to
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
decision
in
bogany.
and
so
the
state
is
trying
to
seek
a
windfall
in
this
case
in
trying
to
find
a
way
to
do
so.
again,
as
i
indicated
a
little
bit
ago,
the
state
has
been
doing
everything
that
it
could
to
undo
the
effects
of
article
37.10(b).
judge
garza
commented
that
he
could
be
sympathetic
with
the
state,
but
wanted
to
do
something
to
avoid
the
retry
of
these
individuals.
but
he
said
it
may
be
wise
public
policy,
but
wise
public
policy
does
not
justify
the
use
of
ex
post
facto
legislation.
justice
chase
also
discussed
the
same
basic
idea
and
said
that
the
british
used
to
justify
its
use
of
ex
post
facto
legislation
to
say
it
was
necessary
for
the
safety
of
the
kingdom.
basically,
we
have
the
same
sort
of
attitude
being
expressed
both
by
judge
garza
and
justice
chase,
that
statutes
were
being
made
because
it
seemed
reasonable
for
a
public
policy
perspective.
but
again,
as
judge
garza
is
indicating
and
as
justice
chase
was
indicating,
if
it
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause,
it
is
not
admissible
or
allowed.
again,
the
framers
of
the
constitution
did
not
buy
the
argument
that
you
ought
to
be
able
to
utilize
ex
post
facto
legislation
for
the
benefit
or
for
the
necessity
of
the
government
or
the
country.
if
it
deprives
an
individual
of
the
basic
right,
then
it
is
ex
post
facto.
finally,
there
is
one
other
point
that
seems
very
important
to
me.
if
article
37.10(b)
is
allowed
to
be
applied
retrospectively,
it
will
seriously
undermine
the
traditional
role
of
the
appellate
courts
in
this
country.
it
would
stand
for
the
proposition
that
anytime
a
legislature
does
not
like
the
effects
of
an
appellate
decision,
then
they
can
come
back
and
pass
a
new
law,
apply
a
label
on
it
that
it
is
procedural
in
nature
and
apply
it
retrospectively.
and
the
effect
of
that
sort
of
proposition
would
be
that
the
basic
notion
in
our
form
of
government
that
a
law
ought
to
be
applied...
or
a
decision
by
appellate
court
ought
to
be
applied
consistently
to
everybody
else
in
the
same
posture,
would
be
eroded,
because
you
have
no
idea
from
one
case
to
the
next...
the
members
of
the
public
wouldn't
have
any
idea
from
one
case
to
the
next
whether
the
law
would
be
applied
consistently
to
them.
and
the
facts
of
this
case,
again,
after
bogany
was
decided,
numerous
individuals
filed
applications
for
writs
of
habeas
corpus.
numerous
inmates
were
having
their
cases
reversed,
and
the
court
wanted
to
stop
that,
understandably
so,
maybe.
but
if
they
deprive
an
individual
of
a
right
that
they
had--
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
--johnson
was
the
first
case
that
applied
article
37.10(b),
that
is
correct.
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
i
would
say
it
would
be
ex
post
facto,
and--
mr.
jon
r.
farrar
--certainly.
i
had,
for
example,
a
case
at
the
time
that
was
decided...
article
37.10(b)
went
into
effect
june
11,
1985.
i
had
a
case
decided
june
17,
1985,
the
exact
same
facts
as
here,
and
the
case
was
reversed,
just
like
the
bogany
cases.
the
state
came
back
with
a
motion
for
rehearing
and
said
article
37.10(b)
just
went
into
effect,
and
we
think
you
ought
to
have
a
rehearing
on
this
case
because
it
is
simply
a
procedural
change
in
the
law.
and
when,
about
a
week
after
the
johnson
case
came
out,
my
case
was
decided
on
rehearing
and
the
exact
same
results
came
out
as
we
have
in
the
johnson
case
or
in
the
respondent's
case.
and
so
your
scenario
that
we
basically
have
has
in
fact
happened
in
texas.
and
again,
in
this
particular
case
as
well,
pursuant
to
11.07,
the
code
of
criminal
procedure,
the
rules
for
filing
applications
of
writs
of
habeas
corpus
in
texas,
the...
youngblood
had
filed
his
application
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
it
went
to
the
trial
court;
the
trial
court
recommended
that
relief
be
granted
based
upon
the
body
of
decision.
and
that
was
in
about
february
1985,
and
then
the
case
sat
at
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
for
a
final
decision.
in
the
meantime,
spaulding
was
decided,
and
then
the
legislature
came
back
immediately
after
spaulding
was
decided
to
pass
article
37.10(b).
and
then,
finally,
my
case
was
decided
after
the
effective
date
of
article
37.10(b).
basically,
the
scenario
that
you
have
here
is
the
legislature
is
trying
to
curtail
all
these
individuals
from
being
able
to
have
the
same
rights
as
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
defined
in
bogany
v.
state.
again,
the,
one
of
the
underlying
reasons
for
the
adoption
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause...
the
state
focused
on
one,
that
is
the
concept
of
notice.
the
other
is
to
prevent
arbitrary
and
vindictive
legislation
on
the
part
of
the
government.
here,
if
the,
i
believe
that
the
government
is
engaging
in
vindictive
and
arbitrary
legislation
to
cut
off
the
possibility
that
anybody
else
could
be
able
to
obtain
relief
as
defined
by
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
bogany.
clearly
the
basic
underlying
notion
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause
is
applicable
in
this
particular
case.
if
there
is
no
further
questions,
i
will
close
at
this
time.
thank
you
very
much.
