--mr.
farrar,
in
deciding
whether
something
is
ex
post
facto,
i
guess
you
have
to
decide
what
the
relevant
point
of
time
is.
and
i
suppose
that
if
you
had
a
law
that
reduced
the
state's
juries
from,
i
don't
know,
from
12
to
nine
people,
after
someone
had
been
tried
with
a
nine-person
jury,
that
would
be
ex
post
facto.
but
it
seems
to
me
what
has
happened
here
is
that
the
state's
appellate
procedure
was
changed
before
your
client
underwent
that
appellate
procedure.
there
is,
the
state
has
not
said
retroactively
that
it
is
okay
to
impose
both
sentences,
both
the
fine
and
the
imprisonment.
it
still
said
you
are
right,
that
was
invalid
before;
it
is
still
invalid.
but
we
are...
this
law
intervened
between
your
client's
wrongful
conviction
and
the
appeal.
all
the
state
said
is
we
are
going
to
have
a
new
procedure,
which
your
client
had
not
yet
undergone.
he
hadn't
undergone
it
and
then
the
state
went
back
and
changed
it.
why...
why
is
that
ex
post
facto?
justice
scalia
where
a
procedure
does
not
exist,
antecedently
you
have
a
right
not
to
have
that
procedure.
that
is
basically
what
your...
what
your
argument
is.
here,
the
procedure
did
not
exist,
the
procedure
for
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
to
simply
eliminate
the
unlawful
portion
of
the
sentence.
and
your
argument
is
you
had
a
right
not
to
have
that
procedure
exist,
which
was
taken
away
when,
after
the
wrongful
conviction
the
statute
was
passed,
and
then
that
procedure
was
applied.
but
that
is
a
very
far-reaching
rule.
i
don't...
do
you
know
a
case
of
ours
that,
or
of
anybody's,
that
would
support
that?
