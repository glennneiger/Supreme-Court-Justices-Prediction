chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
89-742,
james
a.
collins,
director,
texas
department
of
criminal
justice
v.
carroll
f.
youngblood.
mr.
palmer.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
palmer,
you
know,
in
the
opinion,
even
in
calder
against
bull,
and
you
find
in
a
couple
other
of
our
opinions,
they
do
lay
down...
like
beazell,
for
example...
they
do
lay
down
these
three
general
principles
that
you
have
adverted
to.
but
then
there
is
kind
of
language
indicating
that
something
else
might
come
along
too,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
rehnquist
although
clearly
the
right
to
jury
trial
did
not
apply
to
the
states
at
that
time.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
a
change
in
jury
size
meets
the
ex
post
facto
test?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
was
the
absolute
defense
that
the
defendant
was
deprived
of
in
kring,
did
you
say?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
reasoning
really
doesn't
hold
up
under
the
later
cases,
the
reasoning
that
the
kring
court
used,
does
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
palmer.
mr.
farrar.
chief
justice
rehnquist
can
it
fairly
be
described
as
void
when
rendered,
after
the
legislature
has
said
that
it
is
subject
to
appellate
reformation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
the
legislature
comes
along,
as
i
understand
it,
and
says
the
appellate
courts
can
reform
a
sentence
like
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
there
was
no
problem
with
that
under
texas
law,
was
there?
the
texas...
the
texas
court
said
yes,
that
is
fine,
we'll
go
ahead
and
do
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
but
that
really
doesn't
offer
the
court
any
standard
at
all,
mr.
farrar,
to
say
we
have
these
three
categories
that
are
rather
easily
identifiable,
and
then
anything
else
that
is
manifestly
unjust
or
oppressive.
what
does
that
mean?
i
mean,
obviously
i
should
ask
justice
chase,
but
he
is
not
around.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what...
what...
how
does
the
phrase
substantial
personal
right
really
help
us,
other
than
say
it's
a
matter
of
degree.
if
it's
a
little
tiny
change
in
procedure,
probably
no
harm.
if
it's
a
big
change
in
procedure,
then
does
that
mean
the
defendant
is...
can
invoke
the
ex
post
facto
clause?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
more
onerous,
you
say?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
it
is...
supposing
there
is
a
change
in
the
rules
of
evidence,
so
that
between
the
time
the
act
was
done
and
the
time
the
fellow
is
tried
the
rules
of
evidence
are
more
liberal,
and
critical
evidence
comes
in
because
the
state
has
expanded
its
hearsay
rule,
evidence
perhaps
without
which
he
wouldn't
have
been
convicted.
is
that
a
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
let's
say
it
is
applied
evenhandedly.
it
is
applied
to
this
fellow
just
like
everybody
else.
the
legislature
wasn't
out
to
get
this
fellow.
but
it
does
deprive
him
of
the
right
to
object
to
the
admission
of
very
damaging
incriminating
evidence
on
the
grounds
of
violation
of
the
hearsay
rule.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no
problem
there.
it
is
not
a
violation
of
the
ex
post
facto
clause?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
under
the
theory
that
you
and
justice
scalia
were
discussing
a
moment
ago,
might
not
someone
on
your
side
argue
that
the
defendant
had
a
vested
right
in
seeing
that
there
was
no
procedure
for
the
state
to
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
of
north
carolina,
since
it
never
had
that
before,
and
it
is
a
benefit
to
the
defendant
not
to
have
the
state
have
the
right
to
appeal.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
farrar.
mr.
palmer,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
palmer.
the
case
is
submitted.
