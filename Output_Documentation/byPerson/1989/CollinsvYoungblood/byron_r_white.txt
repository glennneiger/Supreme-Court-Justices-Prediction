justice
white
well,
the,
under
the
old
law
the
conviction
would
just
be
set
aside.
the
man
would
not
be
exposed
to
punishment
at
all.
justice
white
i
know,
but
he
has
been
convicted
and
illegally
sentenced.
is
that
right?
justice
white
and
the
appellate
court
says
this
is
an
illegal
sentence,
and
his
conviction
is
hereby
set
aside.
justice
white
and
you
get
a
new
trial.
and
until
there
is
another
conviction,
you
are
not
exposed
to
punishment
at
all.
and
that's
a...
that
seems
to
me
pretty
close
to
even
calder.
justice
white
well,
it
certainly
affects
punishment.
he
may
not
be
punished
at
all
after
a
new
trial.
justice
white
and
at
the
very
least,
he
is
not
going
to
be
punished
for
quite
a...
until
quite
a
bit
later.
justice
white
under
texas
law,
if
the...
under
the
old
law
you
vacate
the
sentence
and
remand
for
a
new
trial,
and
it
ran...
the
jury
would
have
sentenced
in
the
next
trial.
justice
white
he
wasn't
exposed
to
any
greater...
i
mean
the
limits
of
the
sentence
would
be
the
same,
but
the
jury
might,
the
second
jury
might
not
impose
the
same
sentence
as
the
first
jury.
justice
white
and
it
might
be
greater?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
he
might
get
less.
justice
white
exactly,
exactly.
justice
white
also,
the
superior
court
reversed
the
conviction,
didn't
it?
justice
white
and
at
the
time
of
his...
under
the
law
when
he...
when
he
committed
the
offense,
he
would
have
had
a
new
trial.
justice
white
and
the
new
law
was
that
the
state,
there
wouldn't
be
a
new
trial,
the
state
could
appeal
and
maybe
have
the
conviction
reinstated.
justice
white
that
is
not
a
substantial
right?
justice
white
he
had
a
right
to
a
new
trial,
which
has
been
taken
away
from
him.
