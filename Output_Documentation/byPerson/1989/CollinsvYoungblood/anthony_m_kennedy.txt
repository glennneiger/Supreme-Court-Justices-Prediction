justice
kennedy
but
do
you
argue
that
this
claim
is
barred
by
teague
v.
lane?
justice
kennedy
do
you
understand
teague
to
be
a
jurisdictional
rule
or
is
it
something
you
can
waive?
justice
kennedy
and
please
correct
me
if
i
am
wrong,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
he
is
not
liable
for
a
greater
sentence
either,
under
the
pierce
case,
under--
justice
kennedy
--under
double
jeopardy.
maybe
under
ex
post
facto,
but
not
under
double
jeopardy.
justice
kennedy
and
texas
takes
the
position
that
after
an
appeal
the
defendant
can
be
subject
to
a
greater
sentence
than
he
originally
received,
without
any
showing
of
new
evidence
shaping
the
sentencers'
determination?
