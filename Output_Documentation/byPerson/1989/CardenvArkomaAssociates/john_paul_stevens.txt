justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
may
i
just
ask
you.
the
fact
that
it's
been
on
the
books
since
1900,
which
way
does
that
cut?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
law
has
apparently
been
settled
for
89
years
until
this
mesa
case
came
along.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
the
opinion
in
the
great
southern
case
say
anything
about
the
particular
characteristics
of
the
limited
partnership
or
does
it
say,
as
i
read
it,
corporations
are
an
exception
from
the
general
rule
that
everything
else
you
look
at
the
individual
citizenship?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
even
mention--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
doesn't
even
mention
the
single
class
of
citizenship.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
talked
about
a
number
of
other
limited
partnership
cases
that
it
cited
and
seemed
to
think
they
were
all...
you
know,
limited
partnerships
are
limited
partnerships.
it
did
not
draw
the
distinction
that
you
say
clearly
distinguishes
it
is
all
i'm
suggesting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
it
not
true
that
people
generally...
lawyers
generally
for...
ever
since
1900
have
assumed
that
in
a
limited
partnership
you
look
at
the
citizenship
of
the
whole...
of
all
partners?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
three
circuits
have
so
held.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
not
exactly
a
tiny
partner.
it
was
jones
and
laughlin
steel
company
who
was
the
party
in
that
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
opinion
says
it's
authorized
pursuant
to
an
act
authorizing
the
formation
of
a
partnership
and
so
forth
in
which
the
capital
subscribed
shall
alone
be
responsible
for
the
debts
of
the
association
except
under
certain
limited
circumstances.
so
basically
it
was
limited
in
the
sense
that
the
partners
did
not
have
unlimited
liability,
which
is
exactly
what
is
true
of
the
limited
partners
in
xx
two-class
limited
partnership
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
liability
which
is
the
main--
--how
about
the
president?
didn't
he
have
some
authority
that
the
limited
partners
didn't
have?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could
be
distinguished
on
the
ground
that
it's
more
like
a
corporation
than
the
one
we
have
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
great
southern.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what's
the
difference
between
it
and
a
corporation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
the
same
kind
of
limited
liability
the
shareholders
of
a
corporation
have.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
whereas
there's
no...
whereas
in
the
modern
limited
partnership
somebody
has
unlimited
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
that
respect
it's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
to
the
extent
you
rely
on
securities
problems,
you
get
federal
quest
in
jurisdiction,
i
suppose.
