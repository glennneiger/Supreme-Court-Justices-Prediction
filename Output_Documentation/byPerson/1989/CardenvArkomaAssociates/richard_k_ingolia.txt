mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
in
determining
the
presence
or
absence
of
diversity
jurisdiction
in
a
case
involving
a
limited
partnership
it
would
consider
only
the
citizenship
of
the
general
partners
as
being
relevant
to
the
determination
of
that
question.
if
the
citizenship
of
the
general
partners
and
that
of
the
opposing
parties
was
diverse,
the
fifth
circuit
regards
jurisdiction
as
having
been
established.
they
are
wrong
for
several
reasons.
first,
the
decision
conflicts
with
the
supreme
court
precedent
in
navarro
and
great
southern.
second,
instead
of
consulting
the
appropriate
state
law,
which
in
this
case
is
arizona,
it
ignored
that
law,
which
is
contrary
to
the
erie
decision.
and
lastly,
it
ignored
the
interests
of
the
limited
partners
who
owned
99
percent
of
the
partnership
and
in
effect
held
that
they
had
no
interest
in
the
outcome
of
the
suit.
now,
the
rationale
adopted
by
this
court
in
navarro
pointed
out
that
it
had
never
made
an
analogy
between
a
trust
and
a
business
organization
for
the
purposes
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
that
is
what
the
fifth
circuit
is
doing
here.
in
addition,
they
did
not
take
into
consideration
the
differences
between
a
trust
and
a
limited
partnership.
principally,
in
a
trust
100
percent
of
the
legal
ownership
is
vested
in
the
trustees.
the
beneficiaries
have
no
legal
ownership
at
all.
in
a
limited
partnership,
the
general
partners
have
only
management
of
the
entity
and
that
ownership
which
they
either
pay
for
or
earn
by
virtue
of
their
services.
they
do
not
own
100
percent
of
the
assets
of
the
partnership,
as
do
the
trustees
in
an
express
trust.
and
even
the
question
of
management
in
this
case
was
not
entirely
vested
in
the
limited
partners.
twenty
percent
of
the...
on
the
general
partners,
pardon
me.
twenty
percent
of
the
limited
partners
could
prevent
the
sale
of
the
assets
of
the
partnership
and
the
limiteds
could
also
prevent
the
reinvestment
in
drilling
rigs,
which
were
the
only
assets
of
the
partnership.
that
condition
does
not
exist
in
the
trust
situation.
at
least
since
the
time
of
the
decision
in
great
southern
v.
jones,
this
court
has
maintained
that
a
limited
partnership's
citizenship
is
determined
by
that
of
all
of
the
members
of
the
partnership.
there
is
no
distinction
made
on
a
jurisdictional
basis...
on
a
jurisdictional
basis
by
distinguishing
between
the
classes
of
partnership.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
no,
sir,
it
did
not.
it
based
its
decision
entirely
on
their
decision
in
the
mesa
case,
mesa
v.
louisiana
interstate
pipeline.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
the
fifth
circuit
is
apparently
of
the
opinion
that...
imagine
that
this
opinion
arose
from
the
colonial
realty
case
decided
in
the
second
circuit,
which
was
based
on
section
26
of
the
uniform
limited
partnership
act.
in
that
case,
judge
friendly,
i
believe,
as
the
argument
of
the
court,
held
that
he
would
not
consider
the
citizenship
of
the
limited
partners
because
section
26
of
the
uniform
limited
partnership
act
provided
that
they
were
not
proper
parties
to
a
suit
unless
their
own
interests
were
before
the
court.
i
think
that
conflicts
with
what
this
court
has
said
in
navarro,
particularly
in
its
footnote
9
where
it
compared
the
decision
in
united
steelworkers
case
to,
i
believe
it
was
section
17(a)
of
federal
rules.
they
pointed
out
that
while,
yes,
it's
true
that
perhaps
a
labor
union
may
file
suit
in
its
name
and
it
is
a
real
party
at
interest,
but
that's
a
question
separate
and
apart
from
diversity
jurisdiction,
determined
based
solely
on
the
membership
of
the
union.
it
not
having
been
incorporated,
the
court
concluded
that
it
must
consider
the
citizenship
of
all
members
of
the
union
in
arriving
at
a
decision
on
the
question
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
one
of
the
interesting
things
done
in
the
united
steelworkers
case
was
this
court
distinguished
the
earlier
puerto
rico
case
where,
in
that
case,
a
civil
law,
sociedad
en
comandita,
as
they
referred
to
it,
was
considered
to
have
jurisdiction
of
the...
of
puerto
rico
because
it
was
created
under
puerto
rico
law...
puerto
rican
law,
rather.
in
puerto
rico,
as
in
any
other
civilian
jurisdiction,
a
partnership
is
a
juridical
person
and
has
been
for
centuries.
they
would
not
extend
that
principle...
or,
this
court
would
not
extend
that
principle
to
the
labor
union
case,
because
the
labor
union
was
not
something
created
under
a
system
of
law
providing
for
judicial...
juridical
personality
being
vested
in
the
labor
union.
i
suggest
that
the
same
reasoning
should
apply
here.
the
partnership
at
issue
is
an
arizona
partnership.
therefore,
it's
a
common
law
partnership
and
the
great
southern
case
should
cover
that
situation.
it
decided
the
issue
against
diversity.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
yes,
your
honor.
i
assume
that
the
laws
of
puerto
rico
are
similar
to
those
of
louisiana
and
their
common
civilian
heritage
provides
that
a
partnership
is
a
juridical
person,
as
a
corporation
is.
that
provision
is
absent
in
arizona
law.
the
arizona
courts
hold
that
a
partnership
is
not
a
juridical
person;
it's
a
collection
of
individuals.
i
suggest
that
that
is
the
law
that
should
have
been
followed
because
the
court
was
sitting
in
a
diversity
case
and
it
should
have
felt
itself
bound
by
the
erie
decision
and
its
progeny.
it
did
not
do
so,
but
it
did
feel
that
it
would
maintain
the
position
that
it
had
taken
in
the
two
previous
cases
it
had
decided.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
the
court
was
sitting
in
louisiana,
but
it
had
to
apply
arizona
law
in
determining
the
nature
of
the
entity
before
it,
an
arizona
limited
partnership.
it
cannot
apply
the
louisiana
law
to
an
arizona
partnership
any
more
than
an
arizona
court
would
apply
louisiana
law.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
yes.
i
concede
that.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
right.
of
the--
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
--as
an
entity,
as
you
would
with
a
corporation.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
i
should
think
so,
your
honor.
if
the
legislature
of
the
state
chose
to
make
a
partnership
a
juridical
person,
i
should
think
it
has
that
option.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
it
does
not
do
that.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
i
assume
that
the
uniform
limited
partnership
act
follows
the
class
of
common
law
and
treats
partnerships
as
if
they
were
collections
of
individuals,
as
if
they
were
contracts,
as
in
fact
they
are.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
the
only
state
that
i'm
aware
of
that
treats
a
limited
partnership
as
a
juridical
person...
rather,
any
partnership,
not
just
a
limited
partnership,
is
louisiana.
from
what
i've
read
of
the
puerto
rican
law,
they
follow
the
same
principle
which,
of
course,
i
imagine
reflects
a
common
history.
however,
the
common
law
decisions
are
to
the
contract
and
every
common
law
jurisdiction
with
which
i'm
familiar
treats
a
partnership
as
if
it
were
simply
a
contract
in
which
several
individuals
bind
themselves
to
do
certain
things.
but
in
any
case,
i
think
since
we
are
dealing
with
a
diversity
case,
the
court
should
have
turned
to
state
law,
pertinent
state
law
to
determine
the
attributes
of
the
party
before
it.
and
if
it
had
done
that
and
applied
arizona
law,
they
would
have
seen
that
the
decisions
in
arizona
hold
that
partnerships
are
not
juridical
persons
if
they
are
collections
of
individuals.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
well,
first,
you'd
have
to
determine--
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
--well,
you'd
sue
the
partnership
and
the
partners
if
you
expect
it
to
execute
a
judgment
against
the
partners
personally.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
well,
i
think
if
you
were
in
a
state
where
the
local
law
permitted
naming
simply
the
partnership,
you
would
name
just
the
partnership.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
well,
then
you'd
have
to
name
them
all.
but--
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
--well,
if
you
want
to
execute
a
judgment
against
them
you
certainly
do.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
not
unless
they
assume
personal
liability.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
well,
i
think
then
the
bank
would
be
limited
to
recovery
out
of
the
assets
of
the
partnership.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
no,
but
that's--
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
--well,
you'd
have--
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
--it
would
depend
on
the
citizenship
of
all
of
the
partners.
if
all
of
the
partners--
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
--yes,
i
think
so,
because
we're
dealing
with
two
different
things,
standing
to
sue
and...
and
how
do
you
determine
the
citizenship
of
this
entity
before
the
court.
i
think
those
are
two
different
things
and
you
can't
confuse
the
two,
and
this
court
differentiated
those
two
different
things
in
its
navarro
decision
in
footnote
9
by
its
reference
to
the
united
steelworkers
case.
in
the
united
steelworkers
case,
of
course,
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
tried
to
rely
on
the
puerto
rico
case,
and
the
court
clearly
said
we're
not
going
to
let
you
do
that
here.
and
you're
citing
to
us
the...
juridical
personality
of
a
creature
that
we
don't
know
anything
about.
that's
something
these
civilians
do.
we're
a
common
law
system;
we're
going
to
decide
this
case
in
accordance
with
the
common
law.
i
think
that
reasoning
leads
you
to
arizona
and
how
arizona
treats
limited
partnership
or
any
kind
of
partnership.
when
you
do
that,
you
find
that
arizona
holds
that
they're
not
juridical
persons.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
he
may
not
have
to
name
them
all,
depending
on
the
local
law.
but
a
federal
court
in
determining
whether
or
not
diversity
of
citizenship
exists
must
test
that
by
the
citizenship
of
all
of
the
members.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
well,
that
makes
sense
because
it
fits
into
the
scheme
of
jurisprudence
that
this
court
has
developed
over
the
years.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
no.
the
specific
issue
here
was
the
absence
of
section
26
from
the
arizona
limited
partnership
act.
they
had
repealed
section
26
so
there
was
no
basis
in
arizona
law
for
making
the
distinction
between
the
limited
partners
and
the
general
partners
based
on
the
limited
partnership
act
of
arizona.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
i
don't
think
it
would
have
made
a
difference
because,
as
this
court
held
in
navarro,
you
test
diversity
jurisdiction
based
on
the
citizenship
of
all
of
the
members
of
an
unincorporated
entity.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
there
is
no
basis
in
the
law
for
treating
a
partnership
as
if
it
were
a
juridical
person,
absent
a
provision
in
the
law
of
its
creation.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
oh,
a
corporation
is
a
juridical
person.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
--recognized
as
an
entity
separate
and
apart
from
its
members.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
well--
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
--i
don't
think
it
would
be...
in
the
sense
that
it
was
sitting
in
louisiana,
and
by
the
law
of
louisiana
a
partnership
can
sue
in
its
own
name
and
the
judgment
would
be
rendered
against
arkoma.
but
arkoma
is
not
a
person
separate
and
apart
from
its
members.
it's
simply
a
contract.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
well,
you'd
get...
you'd
get
your
judgment,
of
course,
against
the
partnership.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
yes.
but--
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
i
would
think
so.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
correct.
that
you
would
first
satisfy
the
judgment
against
the
partnership
assets
and
then
against
the
general
partners.
but
those
considerations
really
are
not
determinative
of
diversity
jurisdiction.
if
we're
going
to
give
effect
to
the
jurisprudence
of
the
court
as
it
presently
exists,
you
turn
to
the
citizenship
of
the
people
who
make
up
the
partnership
in
deciding
that
issue.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
yes,
sir,
i
think
you
do.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
yes,
sir.
but
meanwhile,
in...
taking
the
partnership
assets,
marshalling
them,
you
certainly
take
any
interest
that
the
limited
partners
have
in
the
partnership?
oh,
yes.
certainly.
that
would--
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
--certainly.
certainly.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
oh,
yes,
sir.
they
own
99
percent
of
the
partnership
assets.
so,
in
any
suit
that
the
partnership
lost,
99
percent
of
the
loss
was
theirs,
not
the
general
partners.
so
i
think
it's
quite
unrealistic
to
treat
limited
partners
as
if
they
had
no
interest--
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
--in
the
partnership.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
yes,
justice--
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
--that's
quite
true.
however,
the
choice
of
form...
the
form
in
which
you
are
going
to
do
business
as
a
business
entity
has
consequences.
if
you
choose
to
do
business
as
a
partnership,
you
should
be
willing
to
accept
not
just
the
advantages
of
your
choice,
but
you
should
also
be
willing
to
accept
the
detriments.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
well,
it
would
have
to...
juridical
persons
are
creatures
of
legislation.
they
are
created
by
legislatures.
they
bring...
the
statutes
bring
them
into
existence
because
they
have
this
quality
known
as
juridical
personality.
certain
facts
and
consequences
flow
from
that.
but
that's
not
something
different
from
anything
else
that
we
do
in
the
legal
field.
every
time
we
enter
into
a
contract
to
form
a
trust,
to
form
a
corporation,
we're
making
choices.
and
those
choices
have
consequences.
if
they
wanted
to
preserve
a
juridical
personality
in
this
case,
they
could
have
formed
the
partnership
in
louisiana
or
puerto
rico.
it
would
have
had
juridical
personality.
if
that
was
what
they
were
interested
in.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
there's
a
difference
between
suing
in
a
name
and
the
citizenship
of
that
name,
whatever
that
might
be.
the
citizenship
of
a
name
is
something
acquired
from
a
law,
from
a
statute,
passed
either
by
the
congress
or
a
state
legislature.
that
quality
was
not
breathed
into
the
limited
partnership
in
arizona.
and
if
we...
if
we
are
going
to
adhere
to
the
erie
line
of
cases
and
the
consequences
flowing
from
that,
then
we
must
turn
to
some
source
of
law
to
find
out
what
it
is
that
we're
dealing
with
and
what
kind
of
characteristics,
including
citizenship,
that
this
entity
may
have.
i
think
it's
just
that
simple.
it's
likely
to
vary
from
state
to
state.
but
that
isn't
a
different
situation
from
any
other
diversity
question
in
which
the
erie
line
of
cases
is
at
issue.
the...
probably
the
most
extreme
example
of
an
application
of
erie
that
i
can
think
of
is
woods
v.
interstate
realty
where
this
court
has
held
that
a
state
statute
denying
access
to
state
courts
was
binding
on
a
federal
court
because
the
federal
court
was
sitting
in
diversity.
that's
a
far
more
extreme
example,
i
believe,
than
what
we
have
here
before
us.
all
we're
asking
you
to
do
here
is
to
look
at
the
citizenship
of
the
people
who
made
up
this
entity
and
draw
conclusions
from
that
based
on
your
jurisprudence.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
no,
sir,
he
didn't.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
no.
he
apparently
felt
that
it
was
dated.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
but
until--
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
--yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
section
26.
and
section
26
does
not
exist
in
arizona.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
no,
sir,
your
honor.
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
--i
think
that
the
controlling
decision
is
navarro
where
this
court
made
the
distinction
between
the
citizenship
of
a
labor
union
and
the
question
of
whether
or
not
being
able
to
sue
in
a
name
changed
that.
the
court
held
that
the
ability
to
sue
in
a
particular
name
had
nothing
to
do
with
diversity,
that
that
would
be
determined
from
the
citizenship
of
the
members,
and
in
effect
we
urge
that
you...
you
follow
that
decision.
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
your
honor,
i
can't
recall
all
the...
you
know,
all
these
facts
of
that
case
other
than--
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
problem
with
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
is
you
can't
tell
who
is
in
control.
someone
who
appears
of
record
as
a
limited
partner
may
very
well
be
the
managing
controller
of
the
business.
and
someone
from
the
outside
looking
in
with
nothing
but
the
record
to
look
at
doesn't
know
that.
to...
if
we're
going
to
consistently
apply
the
fifth
circuit's
test,
then
we're
going
to
have
an
enormous
amount
of
in
limine
litigation
and
discovery
to
determine
who
among
the
limited
partners,
if
any,
have
engaged
in
the
management
of
the
partnership.
if
that--
mr.
richard
k.
ingolia
--well,
that's
certainly
an
argument,
justice
scalia.
however,
if
simplicity
of
operation
in
the
administration
of
justice
is
a
test,
following
the
current
jurisprudence
of
the
court
is
a
far
simpler
matter
than
trying
to
delve
into
these
questions
of
who
among
the
44
limited
partners
may
have
involved
himself
in
management,
if
he
did.
i
don't
see
how
even
under
mr.
hoffman's
test
you
can
ignore
that.
