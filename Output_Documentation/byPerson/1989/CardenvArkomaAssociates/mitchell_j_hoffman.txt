mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
first,
if
i
may,
respond
to
a
couple
of
the
questions
that
were
raised
in
mr.
ingolia's
argument.
the
first
one
was
by
justice
rehnquist
as
to
whether
or
not
the
court
of
appeals,
fifth
circuit,
addressed
the
great
southern
issue.
and
not
in
our
particular
case,
but
the
initial
case,
mesa
operating
partnership,
the
fifth
circuit
did
address
the
great
southern
case
and
basically
dismissed
it
on
two
grounds.
one,
that
it
dealt
with
an
old
1900s,
18...
19th
century
limited
partnership
association
that
did
not
have
separate
classes
of
members.
that
limited
partnership
association,
although
deemed
termed
a
limited
partnership,
is
not
the
same
as
the
modern-day
limited
partnership
that
we
have
today...
only
one
class
of
member.
secondly,
it
was
an
old
case
and
the
fifth
circuit
said
that
it
would
be
applied
only
to
those
particular
entities.
so,
yes,
the
fifth
circuit
has
addressed
the--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--well--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--well,
it
was
settled
for
the
limited
partnership
association
that
the
court
had
before
it.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
as
i
recall
the
case,
it
didn't
say
that--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--we're
only
talking
about--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--well,
it
doesn't,
but
then
that
was
the
only
thing
before
it
at
the
time.
so,
unless
the
court
was
just
out
there
looking
for
something
to
talk
about--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--no,
the
court
did
not,
sir.
but
i
think
that
just
looking
at
the
case
and
what
the
holding
of
the
case
was
it
can
only
be
applied
unless
you
all
intend
to--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--well,
i
don't
think
that
that's
entirely
true,
your
honor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
well,
we
have
two
on
one
side
and
a
couple
on
the
other
side.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
judge
friendly
in
1960...
i
think
it
was
'65...
in
the
colonial
realty
case
was
the
first
time
the
modern
limited
partnership
was
considered.
and
when
it
came
through
the
new
york
courts,
the
second
circuit,
you
know,
they
looked
at...
the
courts
looked
at
what
they
were
dealing
with.
and
they
felt...
obviously,
i
think...
they
felt
that
there
was
a
distinction
between
the
entity
with
which
they
were
dealing
in
1965
and
the
entity
which
this
court
dealt
with
in
1900.
and
i
think
it
was
a
valid
distinction.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
in
the
great
southern
case.
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
it
certainly
was.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
the
two
types
of
partnerships?
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
in
the
modern-day
limited
partnership
you
have
two
distinct
classes
of
members.
the
uniform
limited
partnership
act
adopted
by
49
states...
and
louisiana
adopted
some
but
not
inconsistent
provisions...
sets
out
a
scheme
of
running
the
business.
and
that
is
that
you
have
one
class
of
partners
that
control
the
business
of
the
partnership.
you
have
another
class
of
partner
that
is
simply
an
investor.
it
does
not...
that
class
does
not
have
any
control
function.
it
has
no
responsibility,
no
power
under
any
state
law
to
perform
any
acts
for
the
partnership.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
in
great
southern,
as
i
recall,
you
had
one
class
of
limited
partner.
they
were
all
liable
equally.
they
could
all,
with
the
exception
of
some
of
their
management
functions
which
they
by
contract...
not
statute,
by
contract...
gave
to
the
president,
they
could
participate.
they
had
statutorily
no
restriction
as
to
what
they
could
do
for
the
partnership.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
they
just
called
it
a
limited
partnership
association
back
then
simply,
i
think,
because
they
had
this
president
who
could
bring
an
action
on
behalf
of
the
partnership.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
well,
with
one
distinction.
the
liability
side,
apparently,
was
limited
back
in
the
great
southern-type
partnership
and
the
modern-day
partnership.
on
the
flip
side,
the
responsibility
and
power
side,
that
responsibility
was
not
limited
back
in
1900.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
by
contract,
yes.
yes,
he
did.
we
have
now,
however,
the
limited
partnership
acts
that
have
been
amended
a
few
times
and
now
the
most
recent
amendment
in
1985,
you
know,
basically
establishes,
as
i
indicated
before,
a
very
clear-cut
distinction
between
the
two
classes
of
partners.
again,
one
being
in
control,
one
not
being
in
control.
you
cannot,
no
matter
what
you
do
as
a
limited
partner
in
a
modern
limited
partnership...
you
cannot
become
a
general
partner.
no
matter
if
you
assume
more
responsibility
than
you're
entitled
to
or
you're
supposed
to.
the
only
penalty
there
is
that
you
may
lose
your
limited
liability
status,
but
you
cannot
usurp
the
power
of
the
general
partners
simply
by
doing
something
you're
not
supposed
to.
and
that's
important
for
this
reason.
when
you
look
at
real
party
to
the
controversy,
as
that
term
has
been
used
in
navarro
and
a
number
of
other
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
the
power
of
the
partners,
the
power
of
the
individuals
to
act
for
the
partnership
to
control
the
business,
to
sue
on
behalf
of
the
partnership,
is
vested
only
in
the
general
partners.
and
no
matter
what
the
limited
does,
he
can't
take
that
power.
he
can't
take
control
and
he
can't
usurp
that
power
from
the
general
partners.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
i
would
in...
i
would
say
that
based
on
the
real
party
to
the
controversy
analysis,
if
you're
looking...
if
you
want
an
answer
to
that
question
based
on
that
type
of
analysis,
the
most
important
power
is
the
power
to
control
the
business
of
the
association,
of
the
partnership.
you
are
the...
that
person
is
the
one
who
can
direct
what
happens
to
the
partnership,
can
contract
for
it,
can
bind
it.
the
other
people
can't.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
yes,
you
can.
now,
they're
pretty
well
regulated
for--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--your
honor,
i
suppose
you
could
the
state
legislature
could
do
that.
but
they
haven't
because
we've
got
the
uniform
limited
partnership
act.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
that's
a
possibility,
although
i
think
that
the
type
of
legislation
that
exists
in
the
uniform
limited
partnership
act
speaks
against
that
and
will
not
cause
that
to
be
a
concern,
although
i
will...
i
will
admit
that
any
state
legislature
could
do
that.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
yes.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
well,
it
is
and
it
isn't
because
if
you
look
at...
if
you
get
into
this
analysis
of
juridical
person
that
mr.
ingolia
did,
then
it
becomes
important
whether
it's
statute
or
contract.
i
think
that
for
great
southern
the
difference
between
great
southern
and
the
modern-day
limited
partnership
is
mostly
involving
the
control
and
liability
and
the
access
to
the
responsibility
for
the
actions
of
the
partnership.
yes,
the
president
by
contract
was
given
certain
rights,
but
that
did
not
foreclose
the
other
what
they
called
limited
partners
since
they
were
all
limited
partners
and
they
were
all
treated
the
same
way...
that
would
not
foreclose
these
people
from
becoming
more
active
and
doing
something
and
be
authorized
by
the
state
statute
to
do
that.
and
i
think
that
is
the
key
because
you
have
a
distinct
class.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
yes,
arkoma.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
i
think
you
could.
first
of
all...
and
for
several
reasons.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
well,
louisiana--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--well,
essentially
yes.
the
partnership
is
the
primary
party.
the
general
partners
are
a
secondary
partner...
party
under
the
louisiana
partnership
articles
which
are
not
the
uniform
limited
partnership
act
but
kind
of
track
it.
they
were
not
really
proper
parties
to
the
proceeding.
they
could
be
dismissed,
unless
there
are
certain
allegations
that
they
have
gone
beyond
what
the
limited
partner
is
permitted
to
do.
only
in
that
case
would
they
be
able
to
be
maintained.
i
might
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
our
particular
case,
arkoma
was
the
plaintiff.
a
counterclaim
was
filed
against
arkoma
and
the
four
general
partners.
they
didn't
add
the
limited
partners
because
obviously
in
louisiana
you
couldn't
do
that
unless
you
wanted
to
make
an
allegation
that
some
of
the
limited
partners,
whom
they
didn't
even
know,
exceeded
their
statutory
or
jurisprudential
powers.
so
i
will
say
in
louisiana,
of
course...
and
that's
obviously
where
the
case
was
tried...
i
might
say
that--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--i
was
responding
to
justice
white's
question
as
to--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--what
would
happen--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--right.
but
for
procedural
capacity
to
sue
in
the
courts
of
louisiana,
rule
17(b)
says
look
at
the
state
law,
look
at
the
forum
law.
so
we
were...
we
were
in
louisiana,
we
started
there...
17(a)
and
17(b).
i
think
that--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--well,
yes,
sir.
i--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--well,
that's
a
different
story
because
that
1332(c)
directly
addresses
corporations.
and,
yes,
louisiana
and
i
think
all
states
have
separate
statutes
concerning
the
ability
to
sue
a
shareholder
in
a
corporate
context.
you
have
to
make
allegations
of
piercing
the
corporate
veil,
usurpation
of
the
corporate
psyche
and
things
like
that.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
oh,
no.
no,
no.
not
at
all.
all
i...
and
that's
a
distinction
that
i
think
we
may
be
fudging
over
today.
what
we're
talking
about
is
procedural
capacity
to
sue
under
rule
17.
that
is
completely
different
than
your
jurisprudential
inquiry
with
respect
to
the
real
parties
to
the
controversy.
we
cannot
in
louisiana
make
a
substantive
rule
as
to
what
the
liability
of
those
limited
partners
would
be
without
looking
to
the
arizona
law.
if
i
said
anything
to
suggest
to
the
contrary,
i'm
sorry.
but
we
are
strictly...
at
least
at
this
point
in
the
argument...
only
talking
about
procedural
capacity.
now,
this
court
has
held
on
many
occasions,
or
at
least
discussed
in
some
of
their
cases,
that
you
cannot
equate
the
procedural
capacity
to
sue
analysis
with
the
jurisprudential
and
jurisdictional
argument
of
real
party
to
the
controversy.
and
that
they,
although
they
may
go
hand-in-glove,
they're
not
necessarily
the
same.
i
cite
to
the
court
the
bouligny
case
in
'65
involving
the
labor
union.
there
the
labor
union
had
procedural
capacity
to
sue
but
this
court
said,
no,
we're
not
going
to
give
it
jurisprudential...
i
mean,
jurisdictional
entity
status.
and
i
think
that
that
holding
is
limited
to
that
particular
type
of
argument.
we
are
not
suggesting
necessarily
that
this
court
has
to
adopt
an
entity
theory
for
limited
partnerships.
we
don't
think
that's
necessary.
i
personally
think
you
should,
but
that
notwithstanding
that
is
one
option
that's
available
to
this
court.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
well,
i
think
it
will,
justice
white.
and
i...
the
real
party
in
interest,
justice--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--well,
as
did
the
trust
beneficiaries
in
navarro.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
yes,
of
course.
and
i
don't
think
that
that
should
be
the
determining
factor.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
well,
not
exactly
because
i
think...
if
i
can
refer
you
back
to
your
question
a
little
while
ago,
you
said...
or
you
asked,
do
the
limited
partners
have
an
ownership
interest
in
the
assets,
and
they
do
not.
the
partnership...
limited
partnership...
is
a
juridical
person...
and
i
hesitate
to
use
that
word...
but
it
is
an
entity
that
can
own
property
according
to
the
state
statues.
that
entity
owns
the
property.
in
this
case,
the
oil
rigs,
the
drilling
rigs.
the
entity
owned
them.
the
limited
partners
simply
are
like
shareholders;
they
are
equitable
or
beneficial
owners
of
an
interest
in
this
business
that
this
business
does
own
some
property.
so,
no,
they
don't
have
any
of
their
direct
assets
at
stake
except
for
their
financial
investment
as
a
shareholder,
as
any
kind
of
investor
has
in
a
corporation.
and
i
liken
this
to,
if
you
back
up
in
time
to
1957
before
congress
enacted
the
revision
of
1332(c)...
28
u.s.c.
1332(c)...
that
this
court...
it
was
a
jurisprudential
decision
that
excepted
corporations
from
the
general
rule
as
to
complete
diversity.
and
this
court
back
in
1840
and
then
affirmed
in
1850
with
the
letson
case
and
the
marshall
v.
baltimore
and
ohio
railroad
case
made
a
judicial
extension
of
the
diversity
jurisdiction
argument
by
permitting
corporations
to
be
treated
as...
as
entities.
now,
i
submit
that
you
could
do
the
same
at
this
juncture,
although
i'm
not
saying
that
that
is
the
best
way
to
handle
this
case.
i
do
believe
consistent
with
the
opinion
in
navarro
where
you
look
to
the
real
parties
to
the
controversy
and
decided
that
the
trustees
in
that
case
who
managed
the
litigation...
they
held
equitable
title,
they
had
full
control.
the
beneficial
title,
meanwhile,
was
always
in
the
beneficiaries
and
not
in
the
trustees.
and
i
liken
the
limited
partnership
to
that
type
of
organization.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
i'd
say
it
doesn't
matter.
it's
a
juridical
person
to
the
extent--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--well,
i
would
like
to
see
it
as
a...
limited...
as
a
juridical
person.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
well,
yes,
i
believe
it
is.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
i
believe
it
is
and
i
believe
it
should
be
because
it
has
so
many
characteristics
similar
to
a
corporation
that
there's
no
reason
to
treat
it
any
differently?
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
well,
that,
again,
is
something
in
the
sociedad
case,
the
puerto
rico
v.
russell
case
back
in
1933,
the
court
looked
at
all
the
qualifications
and
characteristics
of
the
sociedad
and
compared
them
to
a
corporation
and
found
that
it's
so
very
very
similar
to
a
corporation
and
it
also
had
this
state
with
the
puerto
rican
sanction
as
an
entity,
and
it
said
i'm
looking
at
all...
we're
looking
at
all
of
those
factors
and
we
say,
yes,
this
will
be
treated
as
an
entity
just
like
corporations.
now,
that
you
could
do
with
limited
partnerships.
and
i
would
suggest
that
it
could
be
done,
but
then,
again,
i
think
the
stronger
position
for
this
court
consistent
with
the
whole
line
of
cases
that
have
come
up
over
the
years
is
to
look
at
the
real
parties
to
the
controversy
and
see
who
they
are.
and
then
it
becomes
a
factual
analysis
which
this
court
was
willing
to
do
in
navarro
and
say,
okay,
the
trust
beneficiaries
hold
this,
this
and
this
powers.
and
we're
going
to
look
at
that,
but
we
don't
think
that
those
are
the
kind
of
powers
you
want
to
look
to
to
decide
whether
they
are
the
real
parties
to
the
controversy.
therefore,
we're
going
to
look
at
the
trustees,
and
we
find
all
the
requisite
powers
in
the
trustees
that
are
necessary
to
give
this
court
the
jurisdiction.
because
going
way
back
to
the
wormley
case
and
the
mcdutton
case
back
in
the
1820s
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
we're
going
to
look
to
the
real
party
to
the
controversy
to
decided
jurisdictional
questions.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
arkoma
was
the
record,
the
title
owner
to
the
rigs.
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
in
arkoma's
name.
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
yes,
sir.
i
mean,
arkoma
had
to
appear
through
an
individual--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--as
a
corporation
would
have
to
do.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
but,
yes,
for
all...
for
other
than
diversity
jurisdiction
purposes,
arkoma
is
certainly
a
juridical
person
because
that
entity
could
and
did
in
fact
own
assets
and
contracted
with
various
people,
including
petitioners
for
benefit
and
for...
to
conduct
its
business.
so,
other
than
the
juridical
person
idea
comes
up
i
think
in
a
faulty
context
because
nobody
has
ever
really
asked
this
court
to
assume
or
to
hold
that
for
diversity
jurisdiction
purposes
this
limited
partnerships
or
all
limited
partnerships
should
be...
should
be
considered
an
entity.
if
i
may
get
back
just
one
bit
to
the
navarro
case,
i
find
it
odd
that
this
court
would
put
its
entire
holding
in
a
footnote.
if
this
court
intended
to
say
that
the
navarro
analysis
of
real
parties
to
the
controversy
was
not
to
apply
to
any
other
entity,
i
would
believe
that
you'd
put
it
in
the
main
part
of
the
decision
as
opposed
to
a
footnote
9
which
simply
says
that
we
have
never
up
until
now
analogized
the
limited
partner...
or
the
business
trust
to
other
forms
of
business
entity.
it
didn't
even
mention
limited
partnership.
justice
blackmun,
on
the
other
hand,
in
the
dissent,
indicated
that
he
found
it
troublesome
that
the
court
didn't
take
the
affirmative
step
and
say,
hey,
this
is
just
like
a
limited
partnership;
this
is
just
like
other
business
entities
that
are
out
in
the
commercial
world
in
the
1980s
and
say
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
and
decide
the
issue.
well,
the
issue
wasn't
exactly
in
front
of
the
court
at
that
time
because
you
were
dealing
with
a
business
trust.
but
i
dare
say
the
analysis...
the
five,
eight
pages
of
analysis...
that
you
went
through
would...
would
not
have
been
necessary
had
it
not
been
for
an
opinion
of
this
court
or
a
feeling
of
this
court
that
the
real
party
to
the
controversy
analysis
ought
to
be
maintained.
and
i
say
that
because
in
that
navarro
case,
a
case
of
chappadulane,
i
think...
and
i
may
be
mispronouncing
it...
back
in
1808
firmly
held
that
that
trustees
of
a
trust
were
the
real
parties
and
the
citizenship
of
those
trustees
were
the
ones...
was
the
citizenship
that
counted.
so
you
wouldn't
have
had
to
go
through
a
difficult
analysis
if
you
were
simply
going
to
rely
on
that
old
case.
obviously,
it
seems
to
me
that
because
the
discussion
went
on
that
you
did
feel
that
the
real
parties
to
the
controversy
analysis
ought
to
be
maintained
at
least
now
and
then
left
open
for
discussion
for
future
cases,
which
i
think
this
case
is
the
prime
or
a
very
decent
case
to
look
at
it.
now,
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
interpret
the
constitution.
that
has
been
clearly...
clearly
settled.
the
diversity
jurisdiction
statute
is
what's
involved;
it's
not
article
iii
of
the
constitution.
so
i
think
in
the
case...
your
recent
case
in
june
of
this
year,
newman
green,
you
had
a
footnote
in
there
saying
that
it's
not
a
constitutional
argument.
so
we're
not
asking
you
do
to
anything--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--well,
i
have
two
arguments.
yes,
justice
white.
if
you're
going
to
look
at
the
entity
theory,
which
i
am
not...
that's
not
my
principal
argument...
yes,
i'd
say
you
look
at
the
principal--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--they...
they
very
well
could
be.
but
i'm
suggesting
there
are
two
alternate
ways
to
look
at--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--pardon
me?
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
well,
you
wouldn't.
but,
you
know,
i
looked
at
the
bouligny
case
in
1965
and
this
court
said
specifically,
we're
not
going
to
create
any
new
entities.
at
least,
that's
how
i
read
it.
so
i
don't
want
to
ask
you
to
do
something
that
you
didn't
want
to
do
back
in
1965.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
i
don't
say
they
have
no
interest.
they
are
not
the
real
parties
to
the
controversy
that's
involved.
the
people
who
manage,
the
people
who
control,
the
people
who
operate
this
business
as
a
corporate
board
of
directors,
you
know
that...
those
people,
that
is
the
real
party.
whether
it's
the
entity
or
whether
it's
the
general
partners
because
keep
in
mind
the
distinction--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--no.
but
keep
in
mind,
the
distinction
has
to
be
made
between
the
corporation...
one
of
the
differences
between
a
corporation
and
a
limited
partnership
is
that
you
have
this
class
of
partner
who
are
or
who
is
responsible
for
the
debts
of
the
partnership,
the
general
partners.
so
they
do...
you
know,
there's
an
intermediate
step
between
your
board
of
directors,
say,
and
your
shareholders
in
the
corporate
context
from
your
partnership,
your
general
partners,
to
the
limited
partners.
the
limited
partners
are
no
different
than
your
shareholders.
and
prior
to
congress
in
1958
saying
that
we're
not
going
to
consider
the
shareholders
and
we're
going
to
create
or
we're
going
to
consider
corporations
as
entities,
this
court
made
that
determination,
and
i
think
this
court
can
do
so
now
with
respect
to
limited
partners.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
well,
under
the
entity
theory
you
would
say,
just
like
a
corporation,
that
it's
the
principal
place
of
business
or
the
state
of
incorporation
or
state
of
formation.
that
would
be
the
entity
theory.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
that's
how
you
would
argue
that.
on
the
flip
side,
if
you
say,
no,
we're
not
going
to
create
any
new
entities,
we're
going
to
look
at
real
parties
to
the
controversy,
yes,
then
it's
the
general
partners
who
are
the
real
parties
to
the
controversy
because
they
are
alone
that
class
of
partners,
the
class
of
people
within
this
partnership
who
control,
manage
and
conduct
the
litigation.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
indeed
they
do
because
they
are
responsible.
they
are
liable
to
the
full
extent
of
partnership
obligations.
the
general
are,
not
the
limiteds.
so
they
could
get
hit...
for
instance,
if
petitioners
were
successful,
which
they
were
not,
on
their
counterclaim
for
some
millions
of
dollars,
the
general
partners
would
have
had
to
respond.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
the
limiteds
would
not.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
pardon
me?
what
if
it
was?
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
if
that
was
the
case,
then,
fortunately
for
the
general
partners,
they
would
be
okay.
but--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--well,
everybody
would
have
lost
their
investment,
yes.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
everybody
would
have
lost.
but
i
might
point
in
this
particular
case
the
value
of
the
rigs
in
an
oil
recession
is
not
great.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
and
so
they--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--yes.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
yeah,
like
any
investor.
like
a
corporate
shareholder.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
up
to
the
value...
well,
yes,
up
to
the
value.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
when
it
goes
beyond
the
value,
then
the
generals
have
more
to
lose.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
yes?
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
because
they
would
all
be
general
partners
and
all
have
the
same
rights,
responsibilities
and
powers.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
yes.
similar
to
the
analysis
with
the
business
trust
in
navarro,
you're
going
to
look
to
the
people
who
control.
and
we
may
argue
as
to
who
controls.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
no,
you
wouldn't.
but
it
would
be
the
similar
analysis
that
each
of
those
general
partners
has
the
same
power.
but
you
wouldn't
have
to
get
there
under
your
scenario.
now,
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
overrule
the
strawbridge
case
back
in
1806,
chapman
v.
barney
which
involved
a
joint
stock
association,
or
the
great
southern
case
because
i
believe
that
the
great
southern
case
and
those
other
cases,
although
they
dealt
with
unincorporated
associations,
as
that
term
can
be
broadly
defined,
did
not
deal
with
the
entity
or
the
type
of
business
organization
that
we
are
dealing
with
today.
i
think
that
it
could
be
very
well
distinguished.
the
fifth
circuit
made
the
distinction
that--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--which
one?
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
great
southern
was
less
like
a
corporation
than
the--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--well,
the
corporation,
of
course,
has
statutory
board
of
directors
authority
and
what
not.
the
great
partner...
the
great
southern
limited
partnership
association,
as
it
was
then
called,
i
think
was
just
simply
a
contract
between
the
people
allocating
some
responsibilities.
but
all
the
limited--
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
--yes,
right.
to
that
extent
it
is.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
yes,
sir.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
okay.
there
is
a
distinction
in
that
respect.
now,
the
term,
the
operation
of
the
modern-day
limited
partnership,
i
think
tracks
very
closely
with
the
operation
of
corporations,
particularly
when
you
get
into
these
master
limited
partners...
partnerships
that
are
created
and
sold
on
the
public
market
where
you've
got
thousands
of
shareholders
where
you
don't
really
care
who
the
other
limited
partners
are,
you
just
purchase...
you
invest
in
this
business
operation
and
you've
got
essentially
a
board
of
directors,
i.e.,
the
general
partners,
controlling
the
whole...
the
whole
works.
and
i
think
that
whatever
rule
you
decide
today
has
to
be
applicable
to
not
only
the
partnership
that
we
have
in
question,
which
is
a
44-member
limited
partnership
with
only
one
louisiana
limited
partner.
and
but
it
would
be
applicable
to
these
mass
of
master
limited
partnerships
that
could
cause,
you
know,
a
pretty
big
stink
in
the
securities
industry.
you
know,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
people
invest
in
these
master
limited
partnerships
simply
to
use
diversity
jurisdiction.
not
at
all.
but
it
would
be
unfair
to
preclude
the
master
limited
partnerships
from
diversity
jurisdiction
because
in
all
likelihood
you'll
never
be
able
to
get
diversity
if
you're
a
member
of
one
of
these
master
limited
partners.
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
well,
if
it's
a
question
within
the
partnership
itself.
but
if
it's
a
simple
debt
or
creditor
relationship
where
the
partnership
is
a
debtor,
then
the
security
problems
really
don't
come
into
play.
and
i
might
say
that
diversity
of
jurisdiction
is
still
here.
some
people
don't
like
it,
but
we
still
have
it
and
we
have
to
live
with
it
and
i
dare
say
that
in
my
practice
in
south
louisiana
and
in
southern
texas
i
will
always
file
in
federal
court
with
an
out-of-state
plaintiff
and
i
will
always
remove
with
an
out-of-state
defendant
in
any
of
those
state
courts
over
there.
it
may
be
awhile
since
any
of
you
have
tried
something
down
there,
but
i
can
tell
you
that
there
is
a
reason
for
diversity
jurisdiction
still
existing.
[laughter]
mr.
mitchell
j.
hoffman
well,
it's
been
called
worse.
[laughter]
i
might
point
out...
i
see
i'm
out
of
time.
thank
you,
your
honors.
