justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
clear
that
that
business
organization
under
the
puerto
rican
law
was
a...
was
a
legal
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
mean
you
think
it
should
have...
that
this
decision
would
have
been
correct
if
the
court
had
been
sitting
in
louisiana?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
you're
saying
is
the
case
would
be
different
if
you
were
dealing
with
a
louisiana
partnership?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
if
arizona
chose
to
denominate
its
partnerships'
legal
entities?
justice
antonin
scalia
although
even
in
that
case,
i
suppose,
you
wouldn't
look
to
the
citizenship
then
of
he
unlimited
partners.
you
would
rather
look
to
the
citizenship
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
partnership.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
had...
had
that
section
still
be
in
existence,
what
difference--
justice
antonin
scalia
--uh-huh.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
it
mean
to
be
a
juridical
person?
i
mean,
if
you
can--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
understand,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
this
is
in
a
way,
too,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
if
you
say
that
the
partnership
can
sue...
i
mean,
the
partnership
here
is
suing
in
its
own
name,
arkoma
associates.
judgment
is
rendered
against...
would
rendered
against
it
in
its
own
name,
would
it,
or
in
the
names
of
only
the
unlimited
partners,
the
general
partners?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
would
judgment
be
rendered?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
assume
suit
isn't
brought
in
louisiana,
it's
brought
somewhere
else.
and
you
get
a
judgment...
you
can't
get
a
judgment
against
arkoma.
then
who
do
you
get
a
judgment
against?
justice
antonin
scalia
against...
in
its
name?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
execute
that
against
the
general
partners?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
execute
that
judgment
against
the
general
partners?
i
assume
you
would
first
execute
against
the
assets
of
a
partnership
and
if
that
was
insufficient,
you
would
execute
against
the
general
partners.
so
the
judgment
runs
against
the
general
partners.
by
name
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
you
could
say
the
same
about
a
corporation.
in
fact,
you
could
say
100
percent.
that
you
shouldn't
go
by
the
state
of
incorporation
of
the
corporation
but
in
point
of
fact
100
percent
of
the
assets
are
owned
by
stockholders
who
are
all
around
the
country.
and
should
it
dissolve
immediately,
they
would
get
all
of
the
assets.
and
realistically
it's
coming
out
of
their
pockets
if
you
get
a
judgment
against
the
corporation.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that's
very
persuasive.
you
could
say
that
equally
about
a
partnership
or
a
corporation.
i
mean,
you
know,
who
pays
the
bill?
it's
ultimately
going
to
be...
in
the
case
of
a
corporation...
the
shareholder.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that
when
you're
talking
about
a
normal
partnership
because,
you
see...
i
guess
maybe
i
don't
know
what
we
mean
by
a
juridical
person.
we
have
sort
of
strange
animal
now,
this
limited
partnership,
where
in
fact
the
judgment
doesn't
run
against
the
limited
partners.
it
only
runs
against
the
juridical
entity
that
consists
of
the
partnership
assets
as
far
as
they're
concerned.
and
then,
if
that
is
insufficient,
against
the
general
partners
personally.
but
it
never
runs
against
the
limited
partners
personally.
and
i
don't
know
whether
this
is
some...
maybe
this
is
a
juridical
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
maybe
the
only...
you're
right
that
those
choices
have
consequences,
but
maybe
the
only
consequence
that
is
relevant
for
purposes
of
the
decision
we
have
before
us
today...
that
is,
whether
diversity
exists
or
not...
perhaps
the
only
consequence
relevant
is
whether
you
can
be
sued
in
your
own
name
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
major
difference
between
the
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
what
respect
was
it
a
limited
partnership
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
it
must
have
been
limited
in
some
respect.
wherein
was
it
a
limited
partnership?
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
crucial
power?
i
mean,
i
suppose
states
could
create
all
sorts
of
different
limited
partnership
laws
allowing
the
general
partners
to
have
all
sorts
of
variance
of
powers.
which
is
the
single
crucial
power
possessed
by
the
general
partner
and
not
by
the
limited
partners
which
you
think
makes
this
a
case
different
from
southern?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can
have
varying
state
laws
that
say
he
can...
the
general
partners
can
do
everything
except
and
then
make
a
whole...
you
can
have
all
sorts
of
different
exceptions
from
state
to
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
any
contract
more
than
$200,000?
would
that
be
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
they
should,
we
would
have
to
go
through
each
individual
state
partnership
law
and
decide
whether
somehow
or
other
the
powers
conferred
only
upon
the
general
partner
are
significant
enough
to
come
within
the
principle
that
you're
urging.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
really
have
lost
me.
why...
why
are
we
talking
about
the
louisiana
partnership
act?
this
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
but
this
is
an
arizona--
justice
antonin
scalia
--partnership
we're
talking
about
here.
you
say
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--capacity...
capacity
to
sue
include...
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
louisiana
said
that
the
individual
shareholders
of
a
corporation
could
be
sued
individually?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
in
theory
it
doesn't
matter
what
kind
of
a
partnership
law
arizona
enacts,
louisiana
can
override
it
and
allow
partners
to
be
held
liable?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hoffman,
unlike...
unlike
the
petitioner,
you...
you
assert
that
the
limited
partnership
is
a
juridical
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
just
pretend
that
it
matters.
would
you
say
that
it
is
or
that
it
isn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
care
what
you'd
like
to
see
it
as.
do
you
believe
it
is
or
do
you
believe
it
isn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
the
test
of
juridical
personhood?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
real
argument--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
your
real
argument
is
that
the
limited
partnership
should
be
treated
like
a
partnership
with
respect
to
only
the
general
partners.
if
we
just
had
a
regular
partnership,
not
a
limited
partnership,--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
would
use
the
citizenship
of
the
partners,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
in
great
southern
we
were
confronted
with
the
choice
of
either...
since
they
were
all
limited
partners,
we
had
to
allow
you
to
look
to
the
citizenship
of
all
the
partners,
or
the
only
alternative
was
to
create
a
new
entity.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
we
refused
to
do.
and
you
say
here
we're
not
faced
with
that
stark
alternative.
we
could
go
halfway
and
say
instead
of
creating
a
new
entity
we're
just
going
to
treat
the
general
partners
like
a
partnership.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
wouldn't
say...
why
the
people
who
control?
the
general
partners,
just
like
the
partners
in
a
partnership.
i
don't
think
you
look
to
a
partnership
to
see
how
many
of
the
partners
act...
i
mean,
the
partners
could
contract
one
with
another
that
one
of
them
will
do
all
the
management.
we
wouldn't
alter
our
citizenship
requirements,
would
we,
simply
because
one
of
the
partners
in
an
ordinary
partnership
is
a
managing
partner?
i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
called
home
cooking.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
that
control
is
pretty
bad.
it's
sort
of
hard
to
figure
out
who
has
how
much.
but
what
about
a
test
that
says,
look,
what
we're
confronted
with
is
an
animal
that
is
in
between
a
partnership,
a
regular
partnership
in
which
there's
unlimited
liability
on
the
part
of
all
of
the
partners
and
a
limited
partnership
of
the
sort
that
was
involved
in
great
southern
in
which
there
was
no
personal
liability
on...
on
behalf
of
any
of
the
partners.
here
you
have
one
right
in
the
middle.
you
have
some
of
the
partners
who
have
personal
liability
and
others
who
don't.
so
the
choice
is
whether
you
treat
it...
you
know,
which
way
do
you
flop.
and
why
can't
you
say
so
long
as
you
have
some
partners
who
have
unlimited
personal
liability
you'll
treat
it
as
a
partnership
involving
those
partners?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
question
it
presents
is
as
follows:
in
determining
whether
there
is
diversity
of
citizenship
between
the
parties
as
is
required
for
federal
diversity
jurisdiction,
complete
diversity
is
required,
that
is,
all
the
plaintiffs
must
be
citizens
of
different
states
from
all
the
defendants.
we
have
long
held
that
the
citizenship
of
a
corporate
plaintiff
or
defendant
for
these
purposes
is
not
the
citizenship
of
all
of
its
shareholders
but
rather
the
state
of
the
corporation’s
incorporation.
for
ordinary
partnerships,
however,
we
have
long
held
that
the
citizenship
of
all
the
partners
must
be
taken
into
account.
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff,
arkoma
associates,
is
a
limited
partnership
organized
under
the
laws
of
arizona
suing
two
individual
citizens
of
louisiana.
one
of
arkoma’s
limited
partners
is
also
a
citizen
of
louisiana
which
would
destroy
the
complete
diversity.
the
issue
is
whether
at
law,
it
does
so.
the
district
court
held
not,
and
denied
a
motion
to
dismiss
on
that
ground.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
holding
that
only
the
citizenship
of
arkoma’s
general
partners
was
relevant
for
determining
whether
there
is
complete
diversity.
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
arkoma
cannot
itself
be
considered
a
citizen
of
the
state
of
its
organization
as
that
term
is
used
in
the
diversity
statute.
we
have
steadfastly
refused
in
the
past
to
accord
to
unincorporated
associations
the
unique
treatment
that
we
give
to
corporations
for
that
purpose
rather,
in
a
suit
by
or
against
an
unincorporated
association,
we
have
looked
to
the
citizenship
of
all
the
association’s
members
to
determine
whether
there
is
complete
diversity.
arkoma
argues
that
courts
should
make
an
exception
to
this
rule
in
a
case
of
limited
partnerships
and
should
look
to
the
citizenship
of
only
the
general
but
not
the
limited
partners.
arkoma
argues
that
this
exception
is
required
by
the
realities
of
modern
business
organizations
like
limited
partnerships,
in
which
only
the
general
partners
control
the
litigation
in
the
day
to
day
operations
of
the
partnership.
the
proposed
exception
is
not
supported
by
our
cases
and
we
decline
to
adopt
it.
arkoma’s
arguments
are
more
properly
addressed
to
congress
and
to
this
court.
magee
drilling
company
and
intervenor
below
asks
that
we
affirm
the
judgment
with
respect
to
it
because
diversity
of
citizenship
indisputably
exist
between
it
and
arkoma.
this
question
was
not
considered
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
we
leave
it
to
be
decided
in
the
first
instance
on
remand.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
o’connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan,
marshall,
and
blackmun
have
joined.
