chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
afternoon
on
no.
88-1476,
c.
t.
carden
v.
arkoma
associates.
mr.
ingolia,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
fifth
circuit
opinion
treat
the
great
southern
case
at
all?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
cite
the
great
southern
in
your
case...
in
your
brief
to
the
fifth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say,
then,
a
plaintiff
suing
a
limited
partnership,
even
though
the
plaintiff
asserts
no
claim
against
the
limited
partners...
even
though
he
could
not
recover
against
any
of
the
limited
partners
still
has
to
name
them
all
as
defendants
and
they
must
all
be
treated
as
separate
defendants
for
diversity
purposes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
does
that
make
sense,
really,
if
there
is
no
possibility
of
any
judgment
against
the
limited
partners?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
may
be
a
reflection
on
the
scheme
of
jurisprudence.
[laughter]
in
other
words,
you
say
that
the
jurisprudence
of
the
court
does
not
differentiate
on
the
basis
of
whom
you're
seeking
relief
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
only
after
a
marshalling
of
assets?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
they
have
a
property
interest
in
those
partnership
assets?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ingolia.
your
time
will
be
reserved.
mr.
hoffman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
that's
the
modern
partnership.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
that
differ
from
the
partnership
as
described
in
great
southern?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
great
southern
the
president
had
rights
to
conduct
business,
did
he
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
how
do
you...
you
say
it's...
is
the
main
distinction
you
see?
because
it
was
by
contract
there
and
it's
by
statute?
that
doesn't
sound
very
sensible.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they'd
stand
to
lose
the
stake
in
which
they
have
an
ownership
interest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
say
that
for
diversity
purposes
they
are
governed
by
the
citizenship
of
the
general
partners?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
do
they
lose
any
more
by
a
judgment
against
the
partnership
than
the
limited
partners
do?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hoffman.
mr.
ingolia,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ingolia.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-1476,
carden
against
arkoma
associates
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
