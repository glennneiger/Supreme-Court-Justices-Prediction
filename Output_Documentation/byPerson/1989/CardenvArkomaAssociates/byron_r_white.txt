justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
a
bank
has
loaned
some
money
to
a
partnership
that
was
organized
and
operating
in
the
same
state
as
the
bank
and
the
bank
then
wants
to
collect
a
debt
from
the
partnership
and
in
that
state
a
partnership
is
not
a
juridical
entity.
so
you
sue...
who
do
you
sue?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
wants
to...
who
do
you
sue?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
partnership
is
in...
suppose
the
bank
loaned
the
money
to
a
partnership
in
another
state
and
the
partnership
defaulted
and
you
brought
a
suit
in
the
federal
court.
who
would
you
name?
all
the
partners?
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah.
all
right.
but,
now,
what
if
you're
in
a
state
that
you
do
not
just
name
the
partnership?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
what
if
it
were
a
limited
partner...
partnership?
you
certainly
don't
name
the
limited
partners,
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
they
liable
for
the
debts
of
the
partnership?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's...
so,
let's
just
assume
it's
an
ordinary
limited
partnership;
they
haven't
assumed
any
personal
liability.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
can't
sue
the
limited
partners
as
persons,
as
individuals?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
that...
would
that
destroy...
could
you
bring
a
diversity
action
then--
justice
byron
r.
white
--against
them?
against
the
partnership
or
against
anybody
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though...
even
though
the
limited
partners...
you
cannot
get
a
judgment
against
the
limited
partners?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
if
you
get
a
judgment
against
the
partnership,
you'd
first
exhaust
the
partnership
assets
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
you
can...
if
that
isn't
sufficient,
you
can
get
a
judgment
against
the...
levy
against
the
general
partner?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
they're...
they're
more
than
a
little
parties
in
interest?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
partnership--
justice
byron
r.
white
--suddenly
dissolved
and
they
didn't
owe
any
debts
or
anything,
the
limited
partners
would
get
99
percent
of
the
assets?
justice
byron
r.
white
judge
friendly
certainly
didn't
agree
with
you,
did
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he...
he
didn't
pass
over
great
southern.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
thought
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
--he
thought
that
because
under
new
york
law
the
partnership--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
general
partners
couldn't
be
sued...
couldn't
sue
or
be
sued
unless...
except
under
some--
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you
think
that
would
be
enough,
if
section
26
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
wouldn't
think
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
supposing
louisiana...
this
suit
had
been
against
arkoma...
is
it
arkoma?
justice
byron
r.
white
arkoma
associates
and
the
complaint
named
the
limited
partners
as
well
as
arkoma
and
all
the
general
partners,
could
you
get
the
suit
dismissed
against
the
general
partners
under...
without...
against
the
limited
partners?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
be
kind
of...
you
know,
in
new
york
friendly
said
that
under
the
law
the
limited
partners
couldn't
be
sued
in
a
case
like
this.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
true
in
louisiana?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
real
party
in
interest
analysis
won't
help
you
much,
will
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
limited
partners
stand
to
lose
their
stake.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
maybe
so.
that
may
be
so
but
the
limited
partners
stand
to
lose
their
stake.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
you
would...
according
to
your
argument,
you
would
say
that
the...
you
would
say
that
the
citizenship
of
the
general
partners
isn't
relevant
also.
you
just
go
by
the
name
of
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
thought...
i
thought
you
said
the
real
party
in
interest
was
the
partnership.
they
own
the
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
don't
need
to
go
that
far
you
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
need
to
go
that
far?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
you
say...
you
say
that
the
limited
partners
don't
have
any
interest
because
title
in
the
property
is
in
this
entity.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
general
partners
don't
own
this
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
what
if--
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
if
the
amount
of
the
judgment
exactly
equal
to
the
partnership
assets?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
unfortunately
for
the
limited
partners,
they
wouldn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
up
to
the
extent
of
the
partnership
assets
the
limited
partners
are
at
risk?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
no
more
and
no
less
so
than
the
generals?
