justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
they
had
information
sufficient
so
that
a
discovery
order
were
issued
requiring
the...
the
employer
to
divulge
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
the
affected
employees,
and
if
that
is
a
given,
in
other
words,
would
the
court
not
then
have
power
to
condition
the
discovery
request
on
the
transmission
of
notice
that
the
court
approved?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
i
am
assuming,
because
mr.
justice
brennan
asked
you
if
these
other
parties
might
not
have
some
information,
i
am
assuming
that
in
a
case,
a
court
would
find
that
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
the
affected
employees
are
discoverable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
the
court
then,
as
a
condition
to
its
discovery
order,
impose
restrictions
setting
forth
the
kinds
of
statements
that
should
be
made
to
the
employees
if
a
mailing
went
out?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
that
consistent
with
our
shapero
case?
is
that
consistent
with
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
litigant
to
advise
all
interested
persons
of
the
pendency
of
the
litigation?
that
would
be
a
very
odd
order,
wouldn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
just
answered
my
question
by
saying
that
you
think
the
court,
if
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
the
employees
were
disclosed
by
discovery,
could
prohibit
the
use
of
that
list
for
solicitation.
and
i
am
just
curious
to
know
why
that
isn't
an
infringement
on
first
amendment
rights.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
won't
take
too
much
longer,
but
i
am
assuming
that
it
is
properly
discoverable.
i
am
assuming
the
plaintiff
has
all
of
the
names.
and
i
am
asking
you
what
basis
it
is
for
you
to
make
the
further
statement
that
the
court
could
restrict
the
plaintiffs
from
using
that
list
to
advise
all
employees
similarly
situated.
