mr.
ridley,
you
don't
refer,
i
think,
to
rule
16
of
the
federal
rules
in
your
brief.
that
rule
provides
that
the
district
court
may
adopt
special
procedures
for
managing
potentially
difficult
actions
that
may
involve
multiple
parties.
do
you
think
that
rule
might
have
some
bearing
on
this
matter?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
ridley,
do
you
assert
that
the
trial
court
violated
some
constitutional
right
of
your
client
by
the
trial
court's
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right,
you
complain
then
that
the
trial
court
violated
some
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
we
recognize
a
broad
scope
of
authority
in
trial
courts
to
manage
the
cases
assigned
to
them.
isn't
this
a
critical
tool
that
trial
courts
must
have
to
manage
the
caseloads
that
they
have?
i
don't
understand
why
you
are
suggesting
that
it's
an
obligation
that
we
limit
the
power
of
the
trial
court
to
manage
its
cases.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
is
a
case
before
the
district
court
in,
in
which
at
least
some
plaintiffs
were
properly
before
it
and
your
client
was
properly
before
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr....
mr.
flamm,
do
you
rely
at
all
on
rule
16(b)
as
authority?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
still
assert
that
as
part
of
case
management
alone
that
a
trial
judge
can
go
out
and
facilitate
notice
to
potential
party
plaintiffs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean
216.
you
don't
rely
at
all
on
rule
16?
