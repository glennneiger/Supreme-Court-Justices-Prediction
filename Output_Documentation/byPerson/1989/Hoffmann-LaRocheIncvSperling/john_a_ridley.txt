mr.
john
a.
ridley
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
matter
involves
an
action
brought
pursuant
to
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act.
under
that
statute,
joinder
in
the
suit
by
perspective
plaintiffs
is
governed
by
section
16(b)
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
which
requires
these
individuals
to
file
a
consent
to
join
action
with
the
court.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
whether
any
ascertainable
source
of
judicial
power
exists
to
permit
the
district
court,
as
the
district
court
itself
here
put
it,
to
offer
the
mechanisms
of
judicial
process
to
aid
plaintiffs
in
filling
their
class
with
all
its
possible
members.
specifically,
the
district
court
here
facilitated
plaintiff's
solicitation
effort
in
several
ways.
it
compelled
hoffmann-la
roche
to
disclose
to
plaintiffs
the
names
and
addresses
of
all
those
persons
who
plaintiffs
considered
to
be
similarly
situated,
solely
for
the
purpose
of
inviting
them
to
assert
money
damage
claims
against
roche.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
your
honor,
that
is
uncertain,
and
of
course,
the
district
court
here
entered
its
order
exclusively
on
the
basis
of
facilitating
the
solicitation
of
claims.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
it
directed...
in
addition
to
compelling
the
disclosure,
the
court
also
directed
the
plaintiffs
to
send
notice
to
those
persons
with
the
notice,
expressly
stating
that
it
had
been
authorized
by
the
court.
in
my
argument
this
afternoon
i
would
like
to
make
three
principal
points.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
well,
your
honor,
the
court
did
three
things--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--that
is
correct.
it
reviewed
and
authorized
the
notice.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
and
it
put
its
imprimatur
on
the
notice
which
was
to
be
sent
out.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
they
would
have
paid
for
the
notice.
it
was
not
to
be
sent
out
by
the
clerk
of
the
court
or
the
clerk,
the
court
itself,
although
that
had
been
the
plaintiffs
original
request
to
the
court.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
i
apologize
for
the
court.
in
my
argument
this
afternoon,
i
would
like
to
make
three
principal
points.
first,
judicial
facilitation
of
notice
is
inconsistent
with
basic
principles
of
judicial
restraint
and
neutrality.
second,
no
authority
for
judicial
facilitation
can
be
gleaned
from
either
the
flsa
or
the
adea.
and
third,
the
attempt
by
the
plaintiffs
here
to
rely
on
the
court's
inherent
power
or
to
engraft
a
notice
provision
onto
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
in
particular
rule
83,
must
fail.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
your
honor,
there
has
never
been
a
suggestion
as
i
recall
it
in
the
papers
below
that
that
rule
would
govern
the
situation,
and
i
submit
that
that
would
be
a
rule
which
would
involve
the
regulation
of
the
action
by
the
district
court,
as
opposed
to
the
facilitation
of
the
joinder
of
new
parties
not
necessary
to
the
action
into
the
action.
the
plaintiffs,
in
effect,
concede
here
that
due
process
does
not
mandate
notice.
and
virtually
every
court
which
has
addressed
the
issue
has
held
expressly
that
notice
is
not
required
by
due
process
in
section
16(b)
cases.
this
is,
of
course,
because
non-parties
are
not
bound
by
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
16(b)
cases.
moreover,
potential
opt-ins
in
these
cases
are
not
necessary
parties,
and
their
joinder
is
not
required
for
the
just
adjudication
of
the
claims
of
those
who
are
already
parties
before
the
court.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
i
am
sorry,
justice,
i
did
not
hear.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
the
potential
opt-ins?
mr.
john
a.
ridley
may
have
information.
yes,
we
would
agree
to
that,
judge...
justice.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
but
that
does
not
make
them
necessary
parties
to
the
action.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
justice,
we
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
rules
which
would
provide
for
disclosure
for
this
purpose,
and
the
purpose
was
expressly--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--your
honor--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--justice,
i
believe
that
if
there
were
a
discovery
order
which
was
appropriate
under
the
federal
rules
governing
discovery,
i
think
that
the
court
would
and
should
enter
a
protective
order
against
the
utilization
of
that
information
for
the
purpose
of
solicitation.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
no,
your
honor.
we
have
no
difficulty
with...
shapero.
we
believe
that
the
plaintiffs
were
free
here
to
solicit
the
non-parties
whom
they
wished
to
have
joined.
our
objection
is
exclusively
with
the
court's
involving
itself
in
that
process--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
plaintiffs
could
use
a
list
which
they
got
for
valid
purposes
of
discovery
to
obtain
information
from
non
parties.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
court
should
permit
them
to
come
into
court
to
request
that
information
to
solicit
them,
and--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--justice,
only
if
the
court
has
a
basis
for
believing
that
that
discovery
would
be
used
for
solicitation
purposes
would
the
court
then,
i
believe,
find
it
appropriate
to
enter
the
protective
order
that
it
not
be
used
for
that
sole
purpose.
we
have...
in
this
particular
case,
of
course,
there
was
no
request
to
the
court
below
for
the
discovery
of
names
and
addresses
for
any
purpose
other
than
to
solicit.
the
court's
decision
below
was
based
solely
on
its
perception
of
its
power
to
aid
the
plaintiffs
to
go
out
to
bring
in
all
of
the
non
parties
before
the
court.
that
is
the
objection
which
we
have,
not
to
what
discovery
might
be
required
at
a
subsequent
date
by
the
court.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
oh,
no.
judge...
justice,
we
have
never
objected
to
the
solicitation
by
the
plaintiffs
of
non
parties.
we
recognize
that
they
have
that
first
amendment
right
and,
in
fact--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--that
is
correct,
justice.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
and
if,
in
fact,
they
obtain
that
information
through
some
appropriate
means
for
an
appropriate
purpose,
so
be
it.
but
we
do
not
believe
that
the...
that
the
court
should
be
involved
in
generating
that
solicitation.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
and
that
is
the
evil
that
occurred
here.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
your
honor,
because
it
cuts
against
the
basic
principles
of
neutrality,
judicial
restraint,
which
govern
the
courts
of
our
country.
we
believe
that
the
court
should
be
the
adjudicator
of
disputes,
not
the
generator.
and
here
there
is
no
due
process
reason
for
these
people
to
receive
notice.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
no,
justice.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
i
don't
believe
we
took
that
position.
we--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--oh,
if
it
were
misleading
or
inadequate,
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
that
it
has
the,
power,
power
to
preclude
the
individual
from
opting-in,
but
we
do
believe
that,
under
rule
11,
it
then
has
the
power.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
justice,
if,
in
fact,
there
were
an
application
brought
after
the
notice
were
sent
out,
yes,
i
believe
the
court
does
have
that
power.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
because
those
people,
if,
in
fact,
the
notice
were
misleading,
those
people
would
be
in
the
court
as
parties
plaintiff
in
violation
of
rule
11.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
or,
with,
with
counsel
having
violated
rule
11.
but
in
this
instance,
for
example,
judge...
justice,
there
was
the
r.a.d.a.r.
letter
which
was
sent
out.
we
did
not
ask--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--justice,
if
the
plaintiff
were
voluntarily
to
come
before
the
court,
i
think
the
first
question
the
court
should
ask
is
why
is
the
plaintiff
coming
here.
why
should
the
court
be
involved
in
any
way
in
this
solicitation
process?
ultimately,
we
would
have
no
specific
concern
with
that
as
defendants,
if,
in
fact,
there
were
a
commitment
that
this
was
going
to
be
the
only
time
that
the
plaintiffs
came
before
the
court,
that
they
felt
that
they
needed
that
guidance,
and
that
they
wouldn't
use
the
court's
having
reviewed
the
document
for
solicitation.
where
we
draw
the
line
is
that
if
the
court
were
to
require
the
plaintiffs
to
come
before
it,
we
believe
that
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
first
amendment
rights
of
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
that
is
correct,
justice,
but--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--that
is
correct,
justice,
but
those
cases
are
not
claims
generation.
rule
23
is
not
involved
in
any
way
in
claims
generation.
those
parties
have
been
certified
as
parties.
after
the
certification
procedure,
they
are
parties
before
the
court.
and
that
notice
is
sent
out
to
ensure
that
their
due
process
rights
are
honored.
this
is
a
uniquely...
different
situation.
here,
rule
23
does
not
govern
adea
or
16(b)
actions,
generally,
and
there
is
no
due
process
or
necessary
party
requirement
that
mandates
that
non
parties
go
out,
be
given
notice.
these
people
are,
are
just
the
same
as,
as
individuals
who
have
been
the
victims
for
example
of
a
mass
air
crash,
where
no
rule
23
class
action
has
been
certified.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
i
am
sorry.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
yes,
it
is
section
16(b)
of
the
fair
labor
standards
acts;
it's,
it's
section
216(b)
of
title
29.
but
there
is
a...
i,
i
believe,
a
critical
difference
between
the
notice
which
is
required
to
be
sent
out
in
rule
23
cases
when
classes
have
been
certified,
and
the
notice
which
the
court
wished
to
send
out
here,
where
there
has
been
no
class
certified,
where
no
rule
23
class
will
be
certified
because
it
is
inconsistent
because
the
statute,
the
16(b)
statute,
requires
the
individuals
to
affirmatively
opt-in.
given
that,
we
submit
that
rule
23
case
law
jurisprudence
is
totally
inapposite
to
what
is
before
the
court
today.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
that
they,
the
district
court--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--that
is
correct,
and
we
submit,
justice,
that
that
process
whereby
the
district
court
certifies
an
action
as
a
class
action,
which
is
wholly
absent
in
a
16(b)
situation:
we
have
no
requirements,
no
criteria
to
be
satisfied
before
notice
is
sent
out,
if--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--those
individuals,
once
the
class
has
been
certified--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--yes,
and
that
is,
he
is
adjudicating
the
rights
where
the,
where
the
issue--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--justice,
i
believe
that
the
analogy
is
to
those
who
might
be
joined
under
rule
24(b),
under
a
permissive
intervention
situation,
where
they
have
claims
which
might
properly
be
joined
because
they
have
common
questions
of
law
or
fact
with
the
claims
of
those
already
before
the
court.
but
there
is
no
need
for
them
to
be
parties
in
order
to
adjudicate
the
claims
of
those
who
are
before
the
court.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
well,
justice,
i
submit
that
if
the
issue
is
claims
consolidation,
rather
than
claims
gathering,
we
have
procedures
which
amply
cover
that.
obviously,
140...
section
1404
of
the
judicial
panel
for
multi
district
litigation
and
the
like,
all
those
sections,
that
law,
that
body
of
law
provides
for
consolidating
claims
which
individuals
have
brought,
whether
in
the
same
form
or
different
forms.
that's
not,
i
suggest,
the
issue
here.
the
issue
here
is
the
court
assisting
the
plaintiffs,
very
actively
assisting
the
plaintiffs
in
going
out
and
generating
and
bringing
in
those
potential
claimants.
and
that,
i
submit,
is
a
radical
departure
for
the
court
to
do.
i
think
what
happens
is
that
we
are
accustomed
to
notice
in
the
context
of
rule
23,
but
i
believe
that
there
is
a
significant
difference
between
the
rule
23,
situation
where
you
have
already
an
adjudication
that
these
individuals
are
parties
to
the
action,
and
here...
and,
and
their
due
process
rights
obviously
are
affected
because
they
are
to
be
bound
by
that
action...
and
the
situation
here,
where
there
is
no
due
process
consideration,
nobody
suggests
that.
there
is
no
effect
on
these
non
parties
if
the
court
does
not
assist
in
bringing
them
before
the
court.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
your
honor,
that
can
happen
with
respect
to
any
potential
litigant
who
might
have
a
claim
out
there.
and
we
have
never,
i
don't
think
it
has
ever
been
suggested
that
it
is
the
role
of
the
judiciary
to
go
out
and
to
ensure
that
those
who
have
statutes
of
limitation
which
might
be
running
are
brought
in
before
the
court
so
that
the
court
can
adjudicate
their
claims
in
a
timely
fashion.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
well,
there
is...
there
is
a
case
or
controversy
in
the
sense
that
there
are
parties
before
the
court
whose
claims
will
be
adjudicated.
but
what
we
suggest
here
is
that
the
court
is
assisting
the
plaintiffs
in
a
tactical
maneuver.
i,
i
don't
use
maneuver
in
the
bad
sense
of,
of
the
term,
but--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--he
may
well.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
justice,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
claim--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--the
district
court's...
the
district
court's
purpose
here
was
extremely
candidly
expressed.
it
was
to
aid
plaintiffs
in
filling
their
class.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
well,
he
may
or
may
not
under
justice
stevens'
hypothesis.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
yes,
we
would.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
oh,
i
think
so,
justice.
i...
i
take
comfort
in
the
ability
of
the
district
courts
to
enter
protective
orders
when
necessary
to--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--it
is
customary
in
the
age
cases
which
the
courts,
the
district
courts
adjudicate,
for
example,
for
them
to
set
cut-off
dates
for
opt-ins.
typically,
those
cut
off
dates
are
not
long
after
the
filing
of
the
initial
complaint.
now,
that
is
a
pure
case
management
concern.
but
i
believe
that
a
district
court
could
enter
a
protective
order
which
would
ensure--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--that,
given
the
good
faith
of
the
counsel--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--i
believe
that
the
court
does
have
the
power
to
grant
discovery
on
an
appropriate
application,
and
i
believe
the
court
has
the
power
to
limit
the
plaintiffs'
use
of
that
discovery,
and
to
direct
the
plaintiff
not
to
use
that
for
improper...
for
solicitation
purposes.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
justice,
we
have
no
problem
with
the
plaintiffs'
using
any
means
available
to
them
to
go
out
to
solicit
the
joinder.
the
plaintiffs
have
done
it
here,
they
have
done
it
in
any
number
of
cases
we
cite
in
our
briefs
where
the
court
has
not
given
notice
or
assisted
in
the
giving
of
notice,
and
there
have
been
hundreds
and
even
thousands
of
individuals
brought
in.
that's
the
plaintiff's
right,
that's
the
counsel's
right
under
shapero.
where
we
draw
the
line
is
when
the
court
involves
itself
in
that
process.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
yes,
justice.
when
the
court
orders
the
production
from
hoffmann-la
roche
of
the
names
of
all
of
the
individuals
so
that
the
plaintiffs
can
use
that
to
go
out
and
solicit.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
because
it
is
the
use
of
the
courts
for
a
purpose
which
is
not
provided
by
the
rules
of
discovery,
we
submit.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
that
is
correct,
justice,
if
i
understand--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--well,
in
this
instance
the
court
should
not
be
sending
out
notice
on
its
own,
under...
under--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--yes,
and
so
be
it.
we
have
no
problem
with
the
plaintiff
sending
out--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--they
did
in
this
case;
they
do
it
in
any
number
of
cases.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
in
this
instance,
we
did
object
to
the
so-called
r.a.d.a.r.
letter,
in
which
the
defendants,
the
plaintiffs
sent
out
before
instituting
the
suit.
the
facts
here,
justice,
chief
justice,
were
these.
after
the
reduction
in
force,
in
which
over
1,000
individuals
were
terminated,
the
plaintiffs
and
counsel
got
together
very,
very
promptly
and
had
a
list
of
some
600
plus
names
out
of
a
total
of,
potential
total
of
700
individuals
who
might
come
within
their
definition
of
that
class,
and
they
sent
out
letters
to
all
of
them.
right
after
the
terminations.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
chief
justice,
we
understand
that.
we
acknowledge
it,
if
in
fact
the
notice
is
a,
is
a
problem
notice.
but
that
is
not
to
suggest
that
the
court
should
involve
itself
in
restraining
the
plaintiffs
first
amendment
rights
by
reviewing...
by
mandating
the
review
of
that
notice.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
we
do
not
believe
that
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
come
in
and
ask
the
court
to
enter
a
prior
restraint
against
their
notice
going
out.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
after
the...
after
the
individual,
after
the
400
individuals
opted-in
on
the
basis
of
the
r.a.d.a.r.
letter,
which
we
considered
to
be
incomplete
and
inflammatory
and
inappropriate,
we
came
in
and
said
at
this
point
in
time
we
are
objecting
because
these
people
were
never
contacted
by
counsel.
they
got
a
letter
with
a
consent
to
form...
consent
to
join
form
and
they
sent
in
their
opt-ins.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
at
that
point
in
time,
justice--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--well,
with
respect
to
the
r.a.d.a.r.
letter
which
went
out
from
plaintiffs,
we
believed
that
that
letter
was
so
incomplete
and
misleading
that
those
people
who
were
brought...
came
in
as
a
result
of
that
letter,
should
be
sent
corrective
notice.
we
did
not
ask
that
they
not
be
permitted
to
join.
we
simply
said
that
the
consents
should
be
vacated
without
prejudice
to
a
corrective
notice.
and
there
was...
there
is
a
precedent
in
the
ninth
circuit
for
precisely
that
in
the
partlow
decision,
which
we
relied
on.
but
here
you
have
the
court
dealing
with
people,
parties,
who
are
now
before
the
court.
once
those
people
send
in
the
consents
they
are
parties
to
the
action,
and
we
believe
that
the
court
has
all
the
power
it
needs
to
deal
with
those
parties.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
no,
justice,
we
do
not.
mr.
john
a.
ridley
your
honor,
we
suggest
that
the
appropriate
analysis
is
whether
there
is
a
source
of
power
to
authorize
the
trial
court
to
do
this,
and
we
say
there
is--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--obviously,
we
have
no
objection
to
the
management
of
the
cases
which
are
before
the
district
court.
there
are
a
number
of
additional--
mr.
john
a.
ridley
--that
is
correct,
justice,
but
what
is
happening
here
is
not
case
management,
by
any
stretch.
the
court
has
all
the
power
to
consolidate
the
cases
which
are
brought
before
it,
but
we
are
suggesting
here
that
this
is
pure
claims
generation.
these
parties
are
not
before
the
court,
in
any
sense
of
the
word,
the
individuals
who
would
receive
the
notice
from
the
court.
they
have
in
many,
many
instances
already
received
notice
from
plaintiffs'
counsel.
600
letters
were
sent
out,
400
opted-in,
200
out
of
a
300
universe
of
potential
recipients
of
court
notice
have
already
received
notice.
and
we
submit,
respectfully,
that
that
is
inappropriate
for
the
court
now
to
come
and
request
that
these
people,
if
they
believe
that
they
have
any
claims,
come
before
the
court.
it...
it...
if
the
court
can
appreciate
how
unique
a
situation
this
is,
and
how
different
it
is
from
rule
23
situations
where
there
has
been
an
adjudication
by
the
court,
that
the
"non
parties"
are
in
fact
before
the
court
and,
and,
and
the
class
has
been
certified,
we
submit
here
that
there
is
absolutely
no
precedent.
we
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
decision
in
the
pan
am
air
crash
case
puts
this
entire
situation
in
proper
context,
where
the
court
there
was
facing
the
issue
of
a
district
court
requesting
notice
to
go
out
to
non-parties
who
were
not
necessary
for
the
adjudication
of
the
case,
and
whose
due
process
rights
were
not
impacted
by
the
adjudication
of
the
case
which
was
before
the
court.
i
see
that
my
time
is
up,
chief
justice.
thank
you.
