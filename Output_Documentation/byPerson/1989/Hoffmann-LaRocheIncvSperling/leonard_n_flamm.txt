mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
how
the
issue
before
this
court
is
to
be
answered
may
well
boil
down
to
how
the
question
is
phrased.
the
question
is
couched
in
the
form
of
whether
there
is
anything
in
any
court
rule
or
statute
or
otherwise
which
bars
a
district
court
from
exercising
its
power
to
facilitate
notice
to
potential
litigants.
why,
respondents
have
shown
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
clearly
no,
based
upon
an
absence
of
any
conflict,
of
any
statute,
rule,
legislative
history
or
policy.
aside
from
asserting
some
generalized
objections
which
we
have
heard
about
impartiality
and
judicial
passivism,
roche
apparently
does
not...
does
not
even
disagree.
that
would
seem
to
end
the
matter,
except
roche
has
asked
that
this
court
rephrase
the
question
from,
is
there
anything
that
bars
court-facilitated
notice,
to
the
question,
is
there
any
specific
authority
for
having
it.
of
course,
in
so
doing,
roche
has
attempted
to
shift
the
burden
of
justification
squarely
upon
the
respondents
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
we
would
agree
that
the
roche
approach
is
incorrect,
but
we
are
prepared
for
purposes
of
the
argument
today
to
play
into
roche's
rules
that
we
have
an
affirmative
obligation
and
we
have
met
our
affirmative
obligation,
and
that
there...
and
that
there
is
affirmative
standing
in
the
statute
and
in
the
rules
and
in
the
legislative
history
for
what
we
propose--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--i'd
like
to
add
to
that
question
two
parts.
the
ninth
circuit
has
addressed
a
very
similar
issue
and
has,
unfortunately,
found
that
the
court
does
not
have
some
residual
power.
i
would
assert
that
there
is,
of
course,
a
case
management
power
within
the
court,
so
the
answer
to
the
question
is,
i
think,
in
disagreement
with
the
ninth
circuit,
is
yes,
the
court
has
the
power.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
and
for
that
reason--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--the
case
management
authority
that
is
inherent
in
the
court's
general
jurisdiction
is
inherent--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--well,
obviously,
we
have
216(b)
here.
but
leaving
the
216(b)
question
aside,
if
the
court
had
some
basis
to
believe
that
these
people
are
going
to
come
crashing
through
the
court
door
anyway,
there,
there
may
be
a
basis
for
it.
i
don't
know
that
i
have
to
reach
that
issue
for
purposes
of
this
appeal.
we
think
216(b)
satisfies
any
of
the
concerns
that
were
previously
expressed
by
roche
that
this
is
somehow
proceeding
without
any
statute
or
basis.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
well,
i
think
there
is
a
basis
for
a
court,
if
they
see
that
there
is
an,
an
imminent
likelihood
of
a
number
of
actions
about
to
be
brought...
this
was...
that
was
an
airplane
crash,
and
we,
we
all
know
there
was
not
only
one
survivor,
there
were
a
number
of
persons
who
were
facially
similarly
situated.
the
district
court,
through
the
special
master
who
had
experience
apparent...
apparently
in
the
airline
crashes,
was
eager
to
have
these
people
come
in
because
he
knew
well
from
his
experience
that
that
was
a
case
in
which
it
would
be
desirable
for
multiplicity
of
litigation
purposes,
case
management
purposes,
to
get
all
the
cases
heard.
i,
i
don't
know
that
we
need
to
reach
that
issue,
sir,
because
we
have
the
216(b)
position
of...
of
the...
of
congress
on
that.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
216(b)
is
a
specific
affirmative
statement
by
congress
that
it's
a
good
idea
that
all
persons
with
similarly-situated
claims
be
allowed
to
intervene
in
that
action...
maybe,
though,
intervene
is
not
the
right
word,
to
come
into
the
action.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
well,
if
we
are
talking
24,
you
have
to
start
with
the
fact
that
people
in,
in
a
24
situation
know
themselves
about
the
fact
that
the
action
is,
is
out
there.
in
216(b)
it
is
neutrally
phrased.
it
just
says
that
all
persons
who
are
similarly
situated
may,
through
a,
through
a
mechanism,
find
themselves
in
the
litigation
by
filing
the
opt-in
consent
form.
so,
i
think
216(b)
is
the
clearest
statement
on
the
part
of
congress
that
we
could
get
that
the
idea
of
a
group
action
is
something
that
they
want
to
be
promoting,
and,
and,
and
when
you
apply
that
in
the
ideal
situation
you
have
even
greater--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--well,
then,
then,
we're
not
arguing.
i
am
just--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--i
would
agree
with
that.
roche's
principal
argument
on
this
appeal
is
that...
their
first
argument
is
that
section
216(b),
although
it
provides
for
a
joinder
situation
or
a
collective
action,
is
specifically
silent
on
the
issue
of
court-facilitated
notice.
of
course,
that
statement
is,
is
true,
but
silence
alone
is,
as
we
have
seen
in
many
other
decisions
before
this
court,
is
an
unhelpful
guide
to
plumbing
congressional
intent
either
way.
this
is
not
a
case,
if
i
may,
where
we
have
pregnant
silence.
this
is
not
an
area
where
the
issue
would
be
expected
normally
to
be
addressed
in
a
statute.
this
is
a
detail,
if
i
may
use
that
word,
which
should
be
left
to
the
court,
the
detail
of
notice.
so
the
absence
of
expressed
language
should
not
have
any
significance,
apart
from
the
fact
that
congress
didn't
feel
the
need
to
speak
on
the
subject.
there
is
a
second
argument
that
roche
has
made
that
roche,
that
than
the
congress,
when
they
selected
216(b),
somehow
intended
to
adopt
the
judicial
gloss
of
1938
or
the
judicial
gloss
of
1947
that
was
surrounding
216(b),
and
since
that
judicial
gloss
was
less
than
clear
on
the
issue
of
court-facilitated
notice,
why
that
would
mean
that
the
congress
was
making
some
kind
of
affirmative
direction
that
the...
that
the
gloss
that,
whatever
it
was,
should
not
be
accepted.
the
case
law
that
pre-existed
the
adea
1967
shows
that
there
was
no
widespread
use
of
a
judicially
authorized
notice,
but
there
was,
nonetheless,
some
case
law
support
for
it.
we
will
concede
that
the
number
of
cases
supporting
judicial
notice
were,
were
not
legion,
but
the
likely
explanation
for
that
in
1947
was
that
the
unions,
who
were
the
principal
disseminators
of
the
notice,
didn't
need
the
names
and
addresses.
so
congress
really
had
no
need
to
be
concerned
about
whether
notice
was
needed...
would
be
given
to
people
who
didn't
have
the
names
and
addresses
already.
but
it
is
instruct--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--your
honor,
that's...
that's
a
wonderful
question
that
is
technically
not
before
the
court.
the
statute
has
designated
a
specific
mechanism,
the
216(b)
mechanism,
and
it
seems
to--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--i
understand
that,
sir.
it
is
a
question
that
certainly
has
troubled
us
deeply.
it...
it
case
law
seems
to
be
settled--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--if
we
could
use
rule
23
this
discussion
would
be,
would
be
highly
academic.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
i,
i
follow
your
point.
the
settled
case
law
followed
by
the
circuit
and
the
district
in
which
we
were
in
seemed
to
accept
as
a
given
that
rule
23
would
not
apply
for
the
reason
that
216(b)
was
a,
was
a
specifically-designated
provision
in
the
flsa,
and
that
congress
took
a
rifle
shot
to
bring
that
particular
mechanism
in,
and
by
somehow
a
process--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--it
seems
that
that's
the
case
law
that
has
fairly
gotten
to
the
point
where
the,
the
reliance
on
216(b)
became
necessitated.
that
is
correct.
but
the
point
i
want
to
make
about--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--well,
in
our
final
section
of
our
brief
we
thought
that
the
general
language
of
that--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--i
understand
that,
sir.
our
position
would
be
that
the
general
direction,
that
the
burden
is
now
devolving
back
on
the
plaintiffs
to
get
the
people
up
and
martin
v.
wilks,
to
that
extent,
supports
our
position
before
this
court.
the
point
i
want
to
make
on
the
1947
amendment
is
that
congress
had
a
scalpel
in
its
hand
in
1947.
it
took
out
a
certain
type
of
action,
it
took
out
that
representative
action
in
which
the
person
who
brought
the
action
was
not
himself
a
grievant.
but
it
left
in
the
other
kind
of
collective
action
in
which
the
representative
was
himself
a,
a,
grievant.
and
when
congress
was
wielding
that
scalpel
in
'47,
and
if
they
were
aware
of
what
that
judicial
practice
or
non
practice
was
with
respect
to
notice,
and
they
didn't
see
fit
to
take
out
all
these
collective
actions,
that
failure
to
weed...
to
wield
the
scalpel
in
that
case,
in
our
view,
would
constitute
some
additional
evidence
that
congress
was
quite
content
to
allow
216(b)
to
be
interpreted
by
the
courts
in
a
way
to
promote
the
continued
use
of
the
collective
action
device
in
section
216(b).
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
during
the
course
of
the
litigation,
we
got
approximately
400
people,
a
good
bulk
of--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--your
honor,
the
reason
is
the
pooling
of
resources
that
enable
adea
actions
to
proceed
on
this
basis.
the
word
need
is...
is
a
word
that
has
a
lot
of
meanings.
i
don't
need
them
for,
for,
for
necessarily
winning
the
case,
although
i
might,
because
every
person
who
comes
in
and
tells
me
about
his
case
provides
some
additional
piece
of
pooling
of
information.
he
provides
that
much
additional
financial
resource,
he
provides
that
much
of
additional
story
to
tell
the
jury,
if
it
is
to
go
that
far
about
what
his
particular
problem
is.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
that
is
correct,
sir.
the
statute
is
our
authorization.
the
statute
doesn't
say
you
can...
you
have
to
stop
when
you've
got
enough
people...
when
you've
got
the
critical
mass
to
win
your
case.
the
statute
says
you
can
go
and
get,
as
we
read
it,
all
the
people
who
are
similarly
situated.
and
to
argue
that
i
have
to
stop
because
i
am
filled,
i
am
sated
with
enough
people,
seems
at
least
unfair
to
the
people
who
by
sheer
happenstance
or
the
vagaries
of
rumor
weren't
among
the
first
wave
or
the
second
wave
of
people
who
learned
through
the
grapevine
about
this
case.
it
seems,
as
stewards
of
this
class,
that
we
are
the
attorneys
and
we
have
an
obligation
to
go
and
see
this
through
and
see
that
all
persons
are
receiving
the
equal
opportunity
of
notice
that
this
statute
seems
to
require.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
sure.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
the
question
of
the
opt-ins'
liability
for
costs,
we
have
indicated
in
our...
in
the
notice
that
we
would
ask
the
court
to,
to
circulate,
that
it's
an
open
question,
but
we
would
have
no
objection
if
that
issue
were,
were
fairly
addressed
in
the
notice.
i,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
the
question,
to
be
perfectly
honest.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
the...
if
there
is
a
full
court
notice,
some
courts
have
considered
the
propriety
and
desirability
of
putting
in
a
paragraph
regarding
the
liability
for
costs.
some
district
courts
have
said
there
is
a
chilling
effect
to
the
inclusion
of
that
language--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--we
don't
take
a
position
on
that
at
this
time,
because
obviously
if
we
lose
down
the
line,
i
think,
we
would
probably
be
happy
if
we
could
disperse
the
allocation
of
costs
among
all
the
litigants.
but
i
think
that,
again,
is
a
detail
that
ought
to
be
left
to--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--yes,
sir.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
we
took
the
position
in
the
district
court
that
it
was
chilling,
but
we
certainly
realize
that
that
was
an
issue
of
discretion
for
the
district
court
to
determine
on
its
own
basis
depending
upon
what
he
thought
these
people
ought
to
know
as
part
of
the
information
they
were
receiving
to
join
the
action.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
i
think
the
distinction,
sir,
is
that
in
rule...
in
216(b)
there
seems
to
be
a
declaration
of
a
class
concept
in
the
sense
that
it
says...
it
doesn't
say
all
persons
who
have
a
feeling
that
they
would
like
to
come
in
may
come
in,
it
says
all
persons
who
are
"similarly
situated"
may
come
in
and
have
a
representative
prosecute
the
lawsuit
on
their
behalf.
that
is
going
at
least
a
couple
steps
beyond,
if
i
may,
what
is
in
rule
20,
which
just
says,
well,
if
there
is
a
similar
transaction
everybody
can
go
and
put
their
own
case
in.
in
216(b)
you've
got
a
representative
situation
and
you've
got
a
limitation
that
it
ought
to
be
a
class
that
at
least
has
some
cognizability,
namely
that
it
be
a
class
of
similarly
situated
persons.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
in...
i
think
you
trivialize
216(b)
if
you
say
it
is
nothing
more
than
rule
20.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
justice,
i
think
you...
as
i
was
trying
to
say,
i
think
you
trivialize
216(b)
if
it
means,
if
it
means
nothing
more
than
a
permissive
joinder
provision,
because
here
you
have
got
a
representative
doing
the
prosecuting
and
you
also
have,
it
seems
to
me
in
the
statute,
a
self-formed
class.
it
is
not
just
anybody
who
feels
like
it
can
come
in.
the...
that's
certainly
going
beyond
what
is
in
rule
20
and
rule
24,
in
answer
to
your
question.
roche
has
made
an
argument
here
that,
that
congress
failed
to
include
court
notice
in
the
adea
in
1967,
despite
an
express
inclusion
by
the
advisory
committee
of
court
notice
in
rule
23
only
one
year
earlier.
and
it
tributes
to
congressional
inaction
to
add
notice
to
rule...
to
rule
216(b)
actions
that
there
was
some
kind
of
congressional
rejection.
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
argument
is
based
upon
a
gratuitous
juxtaposition
that
the
federal
rules
amendment
came
in
'66,
adea
was
passed
in
'67.
if
there
was
a
different
time
frame
the
defendant's
argument
would
lose
some
of
its
force.
the
legislative
history--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--your
honor,
i
heard
your
question
earlier
and
i,
i,
i
hadn't
put
it
in
the
brief,
and
i
wish
i
had.
the
answer
is
i'd
have
to
take
a
closer
look,
but
it
does
seem
to
raise
again
the
general
power
of
a
court
to
supervise
and
manage
a,
a
litigation.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
i
would
say
he
could
use
16.
i'd
say
he
has
the
power
reflected
in
20,
in
24,
in
23,
and
we
haven't
discussed
it
but
rule
83,
which
is
the
old...
the,
the
catch-all
category,
which
says
you
can
regulate
your
practice
in
any
reasonable
manner--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--i,
i
was
just
picking
up
justice
o'connor's
point--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--i,
i,
i
meant
statute.
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
meant
section
216(b).
i
apologize.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
no,
sir,
i
meant
section
216(b)
of
the
statute.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
i
have
not
asserted
that
in
the
brief,
although
as
i
said
to
you
in
candor,
i
wish
that
we
had
put
that
point
in
as
well,
that
rule
16
also
provides
still
another--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--all
right,
go.
[laughter]
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
i
don't
have
the
rule
in
front
of
me,
sir.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
because
it
is
a
case
management
point
and
the
court
has
the
power--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--no,
no,
sir.
we
had
not
put
this
point
in
our
brief.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
because
the
argument
seemed
to
have
some
persuasiveness
as--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--implicit
in
roche's
argument
regarding
rule
23's...
rule...
rule
23's
inclusion
of
notice
and
the
absence
of
notice
in
216(b)
is
that
congress
had
some
duty
to
take
a
step,
and
amend
216(b)
or
to
make
sure
that
when
216(b)
was
incorporated
into
adea
that
notice
language
would
specifically
go
in.
it,
it
is
our
feeling
that
congress
does
not
have
the
duty
to
rush
out
and
make
a
series
of
conforming
legislative
amendments
each
time
a
federal
rules
change
could
conceivably
impact
on
a
procedural
aspect
on
a
federal
right.
the,
the
type
of
change
that
congress
would
have
had
to
have
made
would
have
involved
precisely
what
we
think
are,
are
procedural
matters,
which
are
normally
left
to
the
court's
discretion.
finally,
the,
the
point
is
made
that
somehow
notice,
the
concept
of
court
notice
is
indigenous
to
rule
23,
and
sprang
fully
blown
from
rule
23
and
never
preexisted.
of
course,
the
concept
of
court
notice
existed
well
before
rule
23,
and
rule
23
does
not
actually
confer
the
power
on
a
court
to
give
notice
so
much
as
it
merely
confirms
a
court's
original
inherent
power
all
along.
the
advisory
committee
was
bestirred
to
put
explicit
notice
provision
in
the
rule
23
because
of
due
process
considerations,
which
are
certainly
not
present
at
bar.
but
there
is
rule
23(d)(2),
which
provides
for
an
optional
form
of
court
notice
when
due
process
concerns
are
not
implicated.
and
to
that
extent,
rule
23(d)(2)'s
power
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
what
a
court
would
be
doing
here
today:
the
power
of,
of
ordering
notice
for
the
fair
conduct
of
the
litigation.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
advisory
committee
note
to
rule
23
states
that
the
present
provisions
of
216(b)
are
not
intended
to
be
affected
by
rule
23
as
amended.
and
yet
if
you
look
at
rule
23
and
you
argue
it
somehow
to
impact
on
216(b),
you're
precisely
countermanding,
countermanding,
the,
the
directive
of
the
advisory
committee
note.
because
to
argue
that
216(b)
ought
to
have
notice
because
rule
23
has
notice,
why,
that
is
doing
the
very
thing
that
the
advisory
committee
note
cautions
not
to
do:
not
to
interpret
216(b)
in
light
of
anything
that
is
going
on
or
has
gone
on
with...
with
rule
23.
roche's
final
argument
is
that
the
1947
amendments
reflect
some
general
hostility,
1947
amendments
to
216(b)
reflect
some
general
congressional
hostility
to
all
mass
joinder
actions.
of
course,
i
made
the
point
earlier
that
to
cut
out
half,
but
to
leave
half,
is
hardly
to
suggest
that
they
had
a
hostility
to
all
mass
joinder
actions.
if
they
had
the
scalpel,
they
took
care
of
what
they
had
to
take
care
of,
and
left
what
they
had
to
left...
had
to
leave.
briefly,
i
would
like
to
address
some
general
observations
about
helping
the
plaintiffs
or
not
helping
the
plaintiffs.
on
one
hand,
roche
seems
to
argue
that
this
unduly
helps
the
plaintiffs.
it,
it
is
our
position
that
this
is
not
an
invitation
to
join,
it
is
not
an
exhortation,
it
is
not
a
conscription
to
join.
it
is
an
advisory
notice
in
which
the
court,
for
its
own
reasons,
is
not
acting
as
an
umpire
but
is
acting
on
its
own
for
its
own
case
management
reasons.
and
those
are
interests
which
go
beyond
the
needs
of
the
litigants.
roche
also
argues
conversely
the
plaintiffs
don't
need
the
help,
and
we
heard
the
point
earlier
discussed
that
we
had
successfully
gotten
400,
why
don't
we
leave
the
dinner
table?
we
should
be
filled
up.
the
answer
is
you
don't
know
how
many
people
are
going
to
come
in.
the
process
of
informal
networking,
which
is
what
we
would
be
relegated
to,
is
slow,
it
is
inefficient,
it's
unreliable,
it's
incomplete.
networking
can
never
be
effective
as
court
notice.
but
networking
is
inevitable,
your
honors,
and
it
is
unregulated.
and
because
it
is
inevitable
and
because
it
is
unregulated,
those
are
two
reasons
in
an
of
themselves
why
this
court
ought
to
be
concerned...
ought
to
be
concerned
with
giving
court-facilitated
notice.
we
have
heard
it
said
that
this
is
helping
strangers
to
a
litigation.
well,
it
is
true
it
does.
but
to
a
great
extent,
the
pooling
of
resources,
both
monetary
and
informational,
also
benefits
the
litigants,
who
are
desirous
of
proceeding
with
as
many
people
in
their
corner
as
they
want.
now,
the
point
may
be
made,
well,
this...
isn't
this
class
action
run
amuck?
that
may
raise
a
question
for
congressional
resolution.
but
we
are
talking
here
about
everybody
being
given
a
chance
to
come
into
this
action
on
the,
one
the
basis
of
fair
notice,
on
the
basis
of
fair
conduct.
and
for
us
to
say
at
one
point,
well,
you
have
got
enough
and
we
don't
want
to
help
any
more
strangers
because
the
people
already
before
the
court
have
enough
help,
i
don't
think
the
court,
at
least
at
this
stage
of
the
game,
ought
to
be
making
those
determinations.
in
any
event,
that
is
an
issue
of
the
appropriateness
of
class
notice.
that
goes
back
to
the
very
issue
that
we
started
out
with:
is
this
a
notice
question
or
is
this
a
question
of
what
is
judicial
discretion
here?
if
a
court
says
you
have
already
got
400
and
you
don't
need
any
more,
then
let
the
district
court
say
that.
but
in
this
particular
case
the
court
is
not
going...
we
are
not
addressing
the
discretion
or
the
propriety
of
the
court's
exercise
of
discretion.
it
is
a
power
issue
only
and,
therefore,
the
questions
that
were
raised
about
maximizing
litigation,
stockpiling
plaintiffs,
seem
to
have
no
application
to
this
case.
as
i
said
before,
the
precise
issue
before
you
is
really
a
limited
one.
it
is
a
power
issue.
obviously,
the
order
that
is
sought
by
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
will
benefit
them.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
indeed
class
actions
under
the
adea
may
never
get
off
the
ground
if
the...
if
this
court
notice
procedure
is
not
followed.
in
our
case
we
had
400,
but
in
the
next
case
there
may
be
only
a
plaintiff
who
is
not
well
connected
and
who
is
not
well
heeled.
and
what
is
he
supposed
to
do
if
he
can't
find
the
friends
and,
and
conduct
the
grapevine
activities
that
he
needs
to,
to,
to
build
a
case
with
some
degree
of
force
against
an
employer?
roche
has
essentially
skirted
the
basic
issue
of
power,
and
they
have
argued
what
should
be
done,
not
what
can
be
done.
and
to
the
extent
that
this
court
is
being
asked
to
limit--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--we,
we
would
have
done
it
on
our
own.
all
we,
all
we
needed
was--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
well,
i,
i,
i
mean
that
phrasing
of
the
question
sort
of
puts
me
in
a
difficult
position.
we
thought
we
had
a
responsibility
to
the
existing
class--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--all
right,
sir,
we
thought
we
had
responsibilities
to
our
clients
and
to
the
class
as
a
whole
to
promptly--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--i'm
sorry.
we
didn't
have
any
more
names.
we
had--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--we...
i...
i
didn't
send
out
any,
but
600
may
have
been
sent
out.
400
responses
came
in,
but
we
well
knew
there
were
even
more
than
the
600,
and
should
we
have
let...
should
we
have
cast
them
adrift?
did
we
have
a
responsibility
to
that
class
that
we
did
represent?
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
we
were
concerned
that
if,
that
if
we
just
took
the
names
without
the
purpose
of...
we
wanted
to
be
straightforward
to
say
that
we
were
going
to
use
the
names
for
a
solicitation
purpose.
now,
it
has
come
up
today
that
we
could--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--sir,
we
don't,
we
didn't
need
that
language.
i
will
be
candid
enough
to
say
that
that
was...
something
we
asked
for,
but
something
we
could
certainly
have
lived
without.
we
could
have
been
content
in
this
case
with
the
names
and
addresses
without
more.
we
thought
for
case
management
purposes
that
it
provided
the
court
with
an
opportunity
to...
to
send
that
notice.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
it
did
us
a
great
deal
of
good
for
case
management
purposes.
we're
happy
the
court
came
involved
in
this.
but
in
terms
of
our
strict
needs,
the
names
and
addresses
would
have
sufficed.
the
court
notice
set
cut
offs,
set
limitations,
provided
a
form
of
fair
notice
and
provided
a
host
of
benefits
that
we
were
quite
content
with.
but
we
could
have
lived
without
it,
in
the
strict
sense
of,
of
getting
the
names
and
addresses
and
facilitating
the
matter.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
well--
[laughter]
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
i,
i
thought
we
chose
the
path
that
we
were
obliged
to
take
in
terms
of
best
representing
the
class.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
because
the
solicitation
issue
hadn't
been
as
clear
with
shapero
not
yet
decided.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
well,
we
didn't--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--i
don't
know,
sir.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
we
didn't
know
how...
we
didn't
have
shapero
on
the
books--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--no,
we
wanted
to
see
that...
it...
it...
that
the
case
law,
seventh
circuit,
second
circuit,
had
said
use
a
court
notice;
it,
it,
it,
it's
a
better
procedure
than
just
grabbing
the
names.
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
i
could
be
content
with
the
names
and
addresses.
i
think
the,
the
court's
additional
involvement
in
the
notice
has
good
case
management--
mr.
leonard
n.
flamm
--the
court
can
participate
if
it
chooses
to
involve
itself
in
the
formulation
of
the
notice.
we
would
make...
we
would
condition
our
communication
to
these
people
on
the
court's
reviewing
the
notice.
we
don't
require
it
as
an
immediate
need
for
this
particular
litigation.
i
think
we
have
shown
that
we
have
met
the
burden
that
we
have
before
the
court.
