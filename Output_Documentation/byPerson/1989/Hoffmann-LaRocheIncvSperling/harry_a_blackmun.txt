justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
last
term
near
the
end,
this
court
decided
martin
against
wilks.
does
that
case,
in
your
estimation,
help
you
or
hinder
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
have
just
read
what
you
said.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
how
many
hundred
other
people
did
you
get
to
opt-in?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
then
why
do
you
need
the
rest
of
them,
other
than
to
have
additional
clients
and
additional
fees?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
is
true
of
any
multiple
plaintiff
tort
litigation,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
yet,
you
wouldn't
be
doing
that
in
tort
litigation.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
flamm--
--and
it
is
true
that
some
don't
need
it,
but
who
is
to
say
who
doesn't
need
it
after
our
critical
mass
has
been
reached?
mr.
flamm,
could
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that?
