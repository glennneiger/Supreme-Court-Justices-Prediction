justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ridley,
as,
as
i
understand
your,
your,
your
brief,
you
do
think
the
court
has
authority
to
deny
an
opt-in
on
the
basis
that
the...
that
the
notice
was
inadequate.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let
me
ask
you,
do
you
think
the
court
has
the
power
to...
to
refuse
to
permit
a
particular
plaintiff
to
opt-in
on
the
basis
that
the
notice
that
that
plaintiff
was
given
was...
was
misleading
or
inadequate?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can
review
the
notice
that
was
sent
to
these
people
by
the
lawyers
inviting
them
to
opt-in,
and
if
it
finds
that
notice
misleading
can
refuse
to
allow
them
to
opt-in.
is
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
violation
of
rule
11?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
approving
the
letter
in
advance?
can
the...
can
the
court
approve
the
letter
in
advance?
counsel
brings
it
to
the
court
and
says
since
i
don't
want
you
to
throw
out
these
opt-in
plaintiffs
that
i
bring
to
you,
why
don't
we
both
save
ourselves
some
time;
you
approve
the
letter
in
advance.
can
the
court
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
justice
stevens
is
right,
it
does...
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
neutrality?
is
neutrality
the
problem
or
is
it
perhaps
that
there
is
no
case
or
controversy.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
sounds
like
it.
let
me
ask
you
another
kind
of
a
practical
side
of
this
thing.
supposing
that
we
agreed
with
you,
you
say
you
can't
do
this
this
way,
and
so
then
the
plaintiff
says
to
himself
well,
these
people
are
all
potential
witnesses
because
they
are
all
affected
by
the
same
employment
decision,
same
facts.
every
one
of
them
might
have
some
story
to
tell
that
will
shed
light
on
whether
there
was
discrimination.
so
i
would
like
the
list,
whole
list
just
to
use
them
as...
to
interview
them
as
prospective
witnesses.
the
judge
would
have
to
grant
the
discovery
request,
wouldn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
he
does,
and
then
they
say
now
that
i
have
got
the
list
i
am
going
to
send
them
all
a
letter,
you
couldn't
stop
them
from
sending
a
letter,
could
you?
i...
i'm
just
wondering
if
whether
you
aren't
asking
that
a
different
procedure
be
followed
to
get
to
precisely
the
same
result
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
they
didn't
do
that
here,
but
i
am
just
saying
supposing
you
win
and
then
they
come
back
and
say
well,
judge,
we
have
got
another
theory,
we
want
to
do
it
this
way.
why
can't
they
prevail
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
saying
supposing
you
have
won,
and
i,
i'm
a
smart
lawyer
and
i
say
well
i
can
get
around
this,
i'll
ask
for
them
because
i
want
to
take
their
depositions,
and
then
i
use
the
list
to,
to
tell
them
about
the
law
suit.
but
in
that
event...
in
that
event
he
wouldn't
have
the
imprimatur
on
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
were
they...
were
they
objecting
to
it?
were
these
people
objecting
to
it?
i
don't
see
how
the
court
gets
involved
in
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
willing
to
have
the
court
get
involved
in
the
acquisition
of
clients
for
the
benefit
of
your
side
of
the
case,
but
not
for
the
benefits
of
the
other
side
of
the
case.
what
business
was
it
of
the
court's
whether,
whether
these
people
who
chose
to
join
felt
that
they
had
gotten
adequate
or
inadequate
notice?
at
this
stage,
what
business
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
courts
can
do
anything
that,
that
is,
is
not
barred.
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
the
rule
we
operate.
court...
courts
can
do
anything
that
is
not
barred.
that
is
wonderful,
i
never--
[laughter]
you
can't
mean
that,
can
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose...
suppose
a
court
has
before
it
a
case
involving
a
train
wreck,
in
which
there
are
a
lot
of
injured
people,
no
special
statute
governing
this
train
wreck
like
the
age
discrimination
act.
it
has
one
suit,
and
it
says,
gee,
this
court's
probably
going
to
get
a
lot
of
other
suits
from
this
same
train
wreck;
it
is
sort
of
a
shame
to
have
to
try
them
one
by
one.
do
you
think
that
court
could...
could
send
out
notice
to,
to
all
the
other
people
saying,
you
know,
save
us
some
trouble
will
you,
we,
we
have
one
case
in
front
of
us,
we'd
like
not--
can
a
court
do
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--now--
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
216(b)
change
it?
i
mean,
let's
assume
i
disagree
with
you
on
the
first
one,
that
i
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
the
federal
rules
of
permissive
joinder
amount
to
a
similar...
a
similar
endorsement
of
joining
actions
by
the
congress?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
the
permissive
joinder
as
well
as
mandatory
joinder
provisions
of
the,
of
the
rules
amount
to
a
similar
endorsement
of
the
desirability
of
that,
of
that
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then,
then
we're
only
arguing
if
we
disagree
as
to,
as
to
what
the
court
can
do
in
the
railroad
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
flamm,
can
i
ask,
and...
it,
it
sort
of
gets
back
to
the
same
thing
again,
but
i
want
to
know
why
section
216
is
any
more
an
indication
of
the
government
favoring
the
court
reaching
out
to
bring
in
these
plaintiffs
than
is
rule
20
of
the
federal
rules,
which
says
all
persons
may
join
in
one
action
as
plaintiffs
if
they
assert
any
right
to
relief
jointly,
severally
or
in
the
alternative,
in
respect
of
or
arising
out
of
the
same
transaction,
occurrence
or
series
of
transactions
where
there
are
common
facts.
now,
that
says
they
all
have
a
right
to,
to
appear
as...
jointly
in
the
same
case.
216
says
that
any
employee,
if
he
gives
his
consent,
can
join
this
case.
in
one
case,
as
in
the
other,
the
congress
is
endorsing
a
right
to
proceed
that
way.
now,
why
wouldn't
it
be
so,
well...
you,
you
say
it
is
so,
you
say
it
is
so,
that
under
rule
20
the
court
can
go
out
and,
and
seek
plaintiffs
as
well,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
does
it
say
that,
i
am
looking
for
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
behalf
of
themselves
and
other
employees
similarly
situated,
that
is
the...
that
is
the--
