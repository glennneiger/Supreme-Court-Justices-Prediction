did
you
say
they
did
three
things?
the
court
did
three
things?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
ordered
the
names,
it
ordered
the...
it
authorized
the
notice--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
what
else?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
plaintiffs
pay
for
the
notice?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what...
you
must
be,
you
are
probably
confining
your
argument
to
the
age
discrimination
act
where
there
is
a
class
action,
because
it
certainly
is
normal
to,
in,
in
many
class
actions,
for
the
court
to
become
deeply
involved
in
notice.
justice
byron
r.
white
rule
23,
the
court
actually
orders
notice.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
bring
a
class
action
under
the
adea,
under
rule
23?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
just
says
that
parties
may
opt-in.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
would
just
preclude
bringing...
having
a
certification
of
the
class?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
exactly
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
meant
to
preclude...
ordinary
ways
of
bringing
in
class
actions?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
do
you
want
to
involve
the
court
in
the,
in
the
business
of
building
the
case?
you,
you
sent
out
a
notice
of
your
own
to
600
people--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
you
did
it.
you
did
it
on
your
own,
but
you
didn't...
you
only
got
400
responses
to
your
own
notice,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
thought
the
court
would
be...
could
help
you
scare
up
some
more?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
it's
a
different
word
than
saying
building
a
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
didn't
you
just
send
out
another
notice
yourself?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
sent
it
out
to
600;
you
didn't
get
answers
from
all
of
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about...
how
about
just
getting...
how
about
just
using
discovery
to
get
the
names
and
then
sending
out
the
notice
without
involving
the
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
so
you
do
that,
you
get
the
names,
but
why
did
you
want
the
court
to...
why
did
you
want
to
involve
the
court
in,
in...
to
say
that
the
judge
has
authorized
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
it
did
you
any
good
to
have
the
court
expressly
involved
in
it?
