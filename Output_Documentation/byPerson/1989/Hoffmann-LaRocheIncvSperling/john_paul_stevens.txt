justice
john
paul

of
course,
it
is
true
in
the
rule
23
class
actions
that,
i
suppose,
that
the
court
is
not
totally
neutral,
or
is
it,
when
it
certifies
a
class.
it
takes
the
action
of
the
district
court
to
make
the
other
members
of
the
class
actually
become
parties.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are
not
parties
just
because
a
complaint
is
filed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
wouldn't
say
that
a
judge,
when
a
district
judge
certifies
a
class
the
judge
isn't
acting
in
a
neutral
fashion,
would
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
i
said
in
the,
in
the
process
of
certifying
the
class
the
judge
is
acting
in
a
perfectly
neutral
way,
is
he
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
isn't
it
equally...
why
isn't
it
also
neutral
if
congress
has
said
that
persons
similarly
situated
may
join
a
suit
by
affirmative
act,
why
isn't
it
neutral
for
the
judge
to
participate
in
the
process
by
which
they
find
out
about
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but,
but
is
there
anything
that
is
not
neutral
about
a
judge
thinking
well,
we
may
have
40
or
50
law
suits;
it
makes
sense
to
me
to
have
them
all
disposed
of
in
the
same
proceeding,
so
i
will
arrange
to
have
notice
sent
to
all
the...
all
this
group
of
people.
why
is
that
not...
you
say
that
it
is
a
question
of
judicial
neutrality,
and
i
don't
see
that
there
is
any
bias
involved
in
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
statute
might
run,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
no,
you
wouldn't,
but
when
you're...
a
separate
question
is
whether
the
notice
is
proper
when
it
says
is
it
done
with
the
authority
of
the
court.
but
you
would
really
have
a
problem
even
if
you
didn't
have
that
in
there.
you
really
would.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
am
just
wondering
if
we
are
really
fighting
about
anything.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
how
could
you
enter
protective
orders
saying
you
can't
solicit
these
people
as
clients?
they
have
got
a
first
amendment...
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
they've
got
a
first
amendment
right
to
do
that,
no
matter
how
they
get
the
names.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
the
judge
would
do
that,
but
he
might
not
grant
the
plaintiffs'
request
here,
either.
but
our
question
is
one
of
power.
and,...
and
it
seems
to
be
quite
clear
the
judge
would
have
power
to
grant
discovery,
and
having
done
so,
unless
he
had
a
very
short
period
of
opting-in,
the,
the
plaintiff
could
normally
follow
up
with
notice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
when,
when
a
person
signs
a
consent
to
join
the
suit
and
joins
it,
and
assume
you
lose
the
suit,
sometimes
plaintiffs
lose
these
suits,
are
they
liable
for
costs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
and
notice
doesn't
provide
an
answer,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
really
raised,
i
guess,
by
this
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
the
notice,
as
i
remember,
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
that,
does
it?
