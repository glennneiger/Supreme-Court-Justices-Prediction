chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
88-1203,
hoffmann-la
roche,
inc.
v.
richard
sperling.
mr.
ridley.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
they...
would
the
plaintiffs
eventually
have
been
able
to
get
that
by
discovery
anyway,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
without
treating
it
as
a
discovery
matter
yet.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ridley,
we
have
a
good
microphone
system
here.
i
don't
think
you
need
to
speak
quite
as
loud.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
justice
kennedy's
question
is
perhaps
directed
to
the
at
least
implication
of
your
statement
that
solicitation
is
a
bad
word.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
a
16(b)
action,
16(b)
of
what,
mr.
ridley?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
of
29
u.s.
c?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
is
that
improper,
in
view
of
the
previous
colloquy
that
we
had?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
where
the
court
involves
itself
in
that
process.
now,
you
mean
something
more
by
that
than
just
having
the
notice
go
out
under
the...
on
the,
the
stationery
of
the
court,
or
the...
and
have
the
district
court
sign
it.
you,
you
mean
something
more
than
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why,
why
is
that
improper?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
if
it
were
requested
in
terms
of
discovery,
that
would
be
for
the
trial
of
a
lawsuit
which
the
court
is
going
to
do
eventually.
if
you
use
it
just
for
purposes
of
getting
additional
clients,
that
is
something
the
court
ought
not
to
be
involved
in?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now,
if,
if
the
court
didn't
has
sent
out
a
notice
on
its
own,
isn't
it
likely
that
the
plaintiffs
would
send
a
notice
out
on
their
own?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
my
question
was,
assuming
that
the
court
said...
agreed
with
you,
that
the
judge
said,
well,
i
can't
send
out
any
notice,
then
aren't
the
plaintiffs
going
to
send
out
a
notice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then...
then
does,
does
the
defendant
in,
in
practice
in
this
kind
of
case
have
a
right
to
come
into
court
and
object
to
that
notice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one,
one,
one
reason
the
court
of
appeals,
i
believe,
it
might
have
been
the
district
court,
i
think,
gave
for
affirming
the
district
court
was
that
the
district
court
was
going
to
spend
some
time
on
this
matter
anyway.
if
the
plaintiffs
pick
up
and
send
out
a
notice,
the
defendants
object
to
it,
the
district
court
is
going
to
have
to
consider
that
anyway.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
a
defendant
comes
in
and
objects
to
the
notice,
surely
the
defendant
is
asking
the
court
to
put
some
restrictions
on
the
plaintiffs.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
didn't,
didn't
you
come
in
and
object
to
the
notice
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ridley.
mr.
flamm,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
regard
it
as
case
management
when
you
have
got
one
plaintiff
in
a
personal
injury
action
before
you,
or
where
it
was
a
train
wreck
and
there
are
probably
a
lot
of
other
plaintiffs,
to
say
let's
send
out
notice
to
everybody
else
who
we
can
find
that
might
have
suffered
injury
in
that
to
come
in
and
join
this
suit,
when,
when
there
is
no
set
thing
similar
as
216(b)?
that
is
an
extraordinary
notion
of
case
management.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
what
you,
but
you
said
unfortunately
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
the
court
wouldn't
have.
why
do
you
regard
that
as
unfortunate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
flamm,
exactly
what
section
of...
what
part
of
rule
16(b)
do
you
think
authorizes
the
sort
of
thing
that
was
done
here,
rule
16(b)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i'm
sorry,
i
thought
justice...
i,
i...
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
rule
16.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
let
me
ask
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--just
where
in
rule
16
do
you
find
this?
just
where
in
rule
16(b),
what
language
do
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well
then
how
can
you
say
you
think
it
provides
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
a
pretrial
conference
scheduling
[inaudible].
that
is
what
the
rule
says,
the
heading
says.
and
you
are
not
prepared
to
cite
any
language
in
the
rule
supporting,
and
yet
you
say
you
rely
on
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
you
said
you
wished
you
had.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why,
why?
because
it
was
made
by
one
of
the
justices?
[laughter]
let
the
record
show
that
counsel
is
nodding
his
head.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
flamm.
the
case
is
submitted.
