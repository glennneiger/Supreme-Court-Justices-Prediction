justice
byron
r.
white
you,
you
seem
to
concede
that
it
is
a
real
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
van
dusen
applies
to
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
at
least...
the
court
at
least
said
it
wasn't
deciding
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
usually
don't
reserve
questions
that
are
foregone
conclusions
from
the
reasoning.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
law...
you
mean
the
law
that
the
transferor
state
would
have
applied?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
it
certainly
changes
what
the
procedural
rules
are
going
to
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
it
would
also
have
been
tried
under
the
rules
of
that
particular
court.
you
know,
the
federal
rules
don't
have
all
the
rules
that
apply
to
trying
a
lawsuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
different
local
rules.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
tell...
don't
say
the
rules
don't
change
with
the
transfer.
they
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
yeah,
but
the...
yeah,
but
is
the
statute
of
limitations
deemed
substantive
or
procedural?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
for
transfer
purposes?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
stipulated...
what
if
the
two
parties
just
stipulate...
what
if
it
is
a
joint
motion?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
yet,
you
don't
argue
that
if
the
case
had
stayed
in
mississippi,
that
it
could
not
have
been
tried
there.
you...
you
agree
that
if
the
case
had
stayed
there,
mississippi's
statute
of
limitations
would
apply.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,...
and
yet
you
say
it
shouldn't
be
tried
up
in
pennsylvania
even
though
the
same
substantive
law
would
apply
as
would
have
applied
in
mississippi,
and
it
would
have
been
more
convenient
for
everybody,
including
less...
and
more,
and
less
expensive
for
everybody
to
try
it
up
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
had
the
temerity
to
take
advantage
of
one
of
our
decisions.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
you
might
have
done
it
yourself.
