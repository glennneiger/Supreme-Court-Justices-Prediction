does
van
dusen
stand
for
the
principle
that
there
is
simply
no
connection
between
the
convenience
of
the
forum
and
the
applicable
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
it
can
be
read
that
way.
i
am
wondering...
it
would
seem
as
an
intuitive
matter
that
it
should
be
the
other
way
around.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
a
principle
that
states
may
select
the
law
which
should
apply,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
you
have
to
show,
i
suppose,
that
there,
in
order
to
prevail,
that
there
is
some
policy
implicit
in
1404
that
overrides
that
state
choice,
whimsical
as
it
may
be
in
some
instances.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
the
extent
that
this
statute
of
limitations
is
certainly
welcomed
by
the
mississippi
bar,
i
suppose
that
the
rule
that
you
propose
would
keep
all
suits
in
mississippi,
because
no
one
would
move
for
transfer,
and
that
would
tend
to
perpetuate
the
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
incidentally,
on
that
point,
if
ferens
had
moved
to
mississippi,
i
take
it
he
could
not
have
had
the
mississippi
statute
of
limitations?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
anyone
ever
questioned
the
constitutionality
of
that
distinction
based
on
moving?
