mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
sole
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
district
court
sitting
in
diversity
to
which
a
case
has
been
transferred
pursuant
to
28
u.s.c.
section
1404
is
required
to
apply
the
law
that
would
have
been
applied
had
there
been
no
transfer,
where
the
transfer
is
from
a
court
having
proper
jurisdiction,
having
proper
venue,
but
the
motion
to
transfer
was
made
by
a
plaintiff.
the
present
proceedings
were
initiated
by
the
petitioners,
residents
of
pennsylvania,
when
the
exercised
their
venue
privilege
by
filing
a
timely
complaint
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
mississippi,
asserting
claims
for
negligence
and
product
liability
against
respondent
john
deere,
arising
out
of
petitioner
albert
ferens'
loss
of
his
hand
while
cleaning
his
combine
manufactured
by
the
respondent.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
there
is
no
question
about
that,
your
honor.
the
purpose
of
the
filing
in
an
appropriate
forum
was
to
gain
the
advantage
of
the
mississippi
statute
of
limitations.
the
respondents
did
not
oppose
either
the
venue
or
the
assertion
of
in
personam
jurisdiction
over
them
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
on
the
contrary--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--there
was
no
basis
to
do
so,
your
honor.
in
fact,
what
they
did
in
the
case
was
file
an
answer
in
which
they
admitted
specific
facts
that
established
the
venue
in
the
jurisdiction.
they
were
registered
to
do
business
in
mississippi,
they
maintained
a
registered
agent
there,
and
they
were
in
fact
doing
business
in
mississippi.
it
is
clear,
therefore,
that
venue
and
jurisdiction
were
appropriate
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
it
certainly
could
have,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
important
things
that
we
want
to
stress
for
this
court.
it
is
not
our
argument
in
this
case
that
a
plaintiff
filing
a
motion
under
section
1404
has
an
absolute
right
to
a
transfer.
that
is
clearly
not
our
position.
we
may
have
a
right
to
file
a
motion,
but
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
that
case
is
going
to
be
transferred
is
to
be
made
by
the
district
court
after
weighing
all
of
the
various
factors
that
are
appropriate
for
consideration
under
section
1404.
in
fact,
in
this
very
case,
had
the
respondents
filed
some
objection
to
the
motion
to
transfer,
it
is
conceivable
that
the
court
in
mississippi
would
have
denied
the
motion.
had
that
happened,
we
would
have
had
a
forum
in
which
to
try
this
case,
because
the
mississippi
forum
was
clearly
appropriate.
instead,
by
asserting
the
statute
of
limitations
of
pennsylvania
after
the
transfer
had
occurred,
the
respondents
have
essentially
engaged
in
the
practice
of
using
the
transfer
to
defeat
the
state
law
advantages
accruing
to
the
plaintiff
from
its
initial
selection
of
the
forum,
and
van
dusen
proscribes
that
kind
of
conduct.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
i
am
saying
the
reasoning
in
van
dusen,
your
honor.
i
am
not...
it
is
not
our
position
that
van
dusen
held
that,
in
this
particular
case,
the
law
of
mississippi
had
to
continue
to
apply.
in
fact,
the
court
specifically
reserved
judgment
on
that
issue.
we
are
not
claiming
otherwise.
but
it
is
our
belief
that
the
reasoning
in
van
dusen
is
equally
applicable
in
the
present
case,
and
that
therefore
the
law
of
mississippi
should
have
continued
to
apply.
now,
the
venue
privilege
that
is
accorded
to
a
plaintiff
is
well
established
in
the
law.
the
judicial
code
of
1948
established
venue
rights
for
plaintiffs
seeking
to
bring
suits
in
federal
court.
section
1391(c)
of
the
judicial
code...
of
that
provision,
provides
broad
latitude
to
plaintiffs
seeking
to
bring
suits
against
defendant
corporations.
not
only
is
venue
appropriate
in
a
district
where
all
the
plaintiffs
reside,
or
in
the
district
where
the
cause
of
action
arose,
but
venue
is
also
appropriate
with
respect
to
corporations
in
the
district
where
the
corporation
was
incorporated,
in
any
district
in
which
it
is
licensed
to
do
business,
and
in
any
district
in
which
it
is
in
fact
doing
business.
implicit
in
the
provision
of
broad
venue
rights
to
a
plaintiff
is
the
recognition
that
a
plaintiff
can
select
law
in
one
of
those
forms
that
is
more
favorable
than
his
selection
of
another
form
in
the
applicable
law.
in
van
dusen
this
court
recognized
the
propriety
of
the
exercise
of
the
venue
privilege
and
of
the
accrual
of
state
law
advantages
that
arose
because
of
such
a
selection.
indeed,
this
court
specifically
deemed
those
rights
worthy
of
protection
against
defendants
who
sought
to
use
section
1404
to
defeat
those
rights.
now,
there
is
nothing
about
section
1404
that
indicates
that
it
is
any
way
intended
to
defeat
plaintiff's
venue
privilege
and
the
accrual
of
advantageous
state
law.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
well,
your
honor,
what
i
am
suggesting
though
is
that
the
applicable
law
selection
is
a
result
of
the
initial
selection
of
an
appropriate
venue
forum.
that's
implicit
by
the
way
that
section
1391
is
phrased.
section
1404,
which
provides
for
transfers,
is
not
an
automatic
right.
it
does
not
provide
a
plaintiff
or
a
defendant
with
a
right
to
select
a
different
forum
and
a
different
set
of
laws
that
will
be
applicable
to
the
case.
the
law
that
should
be
applied
in
the
case
is
that
which
is
applied
as
a
result
of
the
initial
selection
of
the
forum.
that
is
what
the
venue
privilege
establishes,
that
we
have
a
right
to
do
so.
and
nothing
in
1404
defeats
that
right.
1404,
if
you
view
the
specific
express
language,
contains
nothing
indicating
that
a
transfer
of
venue
should
result
in
a
transfer
of
the
applicable
law.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
it's...
it
does
not
specifically
say
this
statute
is
available
to
plaintiffs,
but
it
talks
it
for
the
convenience
of
parties,
it
does
not
limit
it
to
availability
of
defendants.
and
in
fact,
i
think
the
vast
majority
of
cases
that
have
addressed
that
issue
have
said
that
it
clearly
is
something
that
is
available
to
plaintiffs
as
well
as
to
defendants.
i
don't
really
think
that
there
is
any
question
about
its
availability.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
indicating
that
its
availability
is
on
different
terms.
i
know
that
there
is
an
amicus
curiae
brief
that
suggested
that
the
factors
that
might
be
considered
in
determining
whether
or
not
to
grant
a
motion
made
by
a
plaintiff
are
different
than
those
which
might
be
considered
in
a
defendant-initiated
motion,
but
that
issue
really
isn't
before
the
court,
because
in
this
case
the
motion
was
made
and
the
respondent
did
not
oppose
it.
section
1404's
enunciated
policy
is
to
provide
for
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
witnesses
in
the
interest
of
justice.
there
is
nothing
in
that
enunciated
policy
that
indicates
that
it
was
intended
to
defeat
a
plaintiff's
venue
privilege.
finally,
in
what
meager
legislative
history
there
is
that
deals
with
section
1404,
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
it
was
intended
to
defeat
a
plaintiff's
venue
privilege.
consequently--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--but
i
am
not
sure
that
you
and
i
are
disagreeing,
justice
scalia.
i
am
suggesting
a
rule
that
says
that
the
plaintiff
pick
the
forum
initially,
and
that
is
his
law.
he
then
has
a
right
to
ask
the
district
court,
considering
factors
of
convenience
and
considering
convenience
of
the
witnesses,
factors
of
fairness,
to
transfer
that
case.
but
that
transfer,
under
section
1404,
is
to
have
no
effect
on
the
applicable
law.
that's
the
rule
that
we
are
suggesting
the
court
adopt
in
this
case,
that
it
be
a
uniform
rule,
applicable
regardless
of
whether
it
is
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
that
is
seeking
to
use
1404
to
move
the
case
from
one
court
to
another
court.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
well,
what
i--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--i
think
what
we
are
talking
about,
your
honor,
is
not
necessarily
simply
the
right
to
select
the
venue,
because
obviously
by
transferring
a
case
you
are
changing
the
venue.
but
what
we
are
talking
about
is
what
the
court
talked
about
in
van
dusen,
and
that's
the
state
law
advantages
that
accrue
as
the
result
of
the
selection
of
a
particular
forum.
and
in
van
dusen
the
court
indicated
that
there
was
nothing
about
section
1404
which
indicated
that
it
should
be
used,
or
could
be
used,
to
defeat
those
state
law
advantages.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
but
i
am
suggesting
that
in
van
dusen
the
court's
consideration
of
1404
led
it
to
conclude
that
essentially
1404
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
applicable
law
following
a
transfer.
this
court
concluded
in
van
dusen
that
1404
was
nothing
other
than
a
judicial
housekeeping
measure,
that
all
it
dealt
with
was
the
location
of
litigation,
and
all
it
did
was
authorize
a
transfer
from
one
court
room
to
another
court
room,
that
it
should
have
no
effect
whatsoever
on
the
applicable
law
following
that
transfer.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
because
the
question
was
not
before
the
court,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
is
wise
for
the
court
not
to
decide
issues
that
are
not
before
it.
just
like,
in
this
case,--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
i
seem
to
concede
that
what
is
a
real
issue?
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
oh,
i
don't
think...
van
dusen
does
not
specifically
apply
to
this
case,
because
the
court
reserved
judgment
on
that
question.
but
i
don't
think
any
implication
can
be
drawn
from
the
fact
that
judgment
was
reserved
on
the
issue
that
is
before
the
court
now,
as
to
whether
the
court
would
have
decided
that
issue
one
way
or
the
other.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
issue
simply
was
not
before
the
court
in
van
dusen.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
that
is
correct.
it
said
it
was
not
deciding
the
question.
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
reasoning--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--but
this
court
generally,
i
don't
think,
decides
issues
that
aren't
before
it.
and
in
the
case
of
van
dusen
what
was
before
the
court
was
a
defendant-initiated
transfer,
not
a
plaintiff-initiated
transfer,
and
there
was
therefore
no
reason
for
the
court
to
decide
one
way
or
the
other.
just
like
in
the
present
case,
the
issue
is
not
before
the
court
as
to
what
happens
where
the
plaintiff
has
selected
an
improper
initial
forum.
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
it
is
not
our
position,
and
we
are
not
arguing
here
today
that
if
the
plaintiff
selects
an
improper
initial
forum,
either
because
of
venue
or
jurisdictional
grounds,
that
he
still
is
entitled
to
the
applicable
law
of
the
transferor
state.
and
i
would
submit
that--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--the
law
that
the
transferor
state
would
have
applied,
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
any
opinion
coming
out
of
the
court
today
will
reserve
judgment
on
that
issue
because
it
is
not
before
the
court.
just
as
the
plaintiff-initiated
transfer
question
was
not
before
the
court
in
van
dusen.
i
think
there
is
nothing
about
a
plaintiff-initiated
transfer
which
compels
any
different
result
than
that
of
a
defendant-initiated
transfer.
if
you
look
at
the
express
language
in
section
1404
there
is
nothing
that
suggests
that
its
use
by
a
plaintiff
somehow
turns
it
into
a
devise
to
defeat
the
plaintiff's
state
law
advantages
accruing
from
the
exercise,
or
the
proper
exercise,
of
its
venue
privilege.
there
is
nothing
in
the
enunciated
policy
that
suggests
that,
or
in
the
legislative
history
that
suggests
that
anything
about
a
plaintiff's
use
of
the
section
makes
it
different
than
a
defendant's
use.
in
fact--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--that
would
be
our
contention,
your
honor.
if
1404
deals
only--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--well,
1404
deals
only
with
consideration
of
convenience
and
fairness,
not
with
considerations
of
the
applicable
law.
that's
a
result
of
this
court's
determination
in
van
dusen
that
it
is
just
a
judicial
housekeeping
measure.
in
fact,
this
court
only
last
year
described
section
1404
in
the
very
same
way
in
the
stewart
organization
case.
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinions
in
those
cases
described
1404
as
a
mere
judicial
housekeeping
measure.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
that
is
absolutely
incorrect,
your
honor.
if
the
motion...
see,
one
of
the
problems
with
this
case
is
that
the
respondents
did
not
oppose
the
motion.
therefore,
everybody
assumes
that
we
automatically
had
a
right
to
come
back
to
pennsylvania,
or
that,
if
they
had
opposed
the
motion
successfully,
we
would
have
abandoned
the
suit
in
mississippi.
that
is
not
correct.
mississippi
was
clearly
a
proper
forum.
this
case
would
have
been
tried
in
mississippi--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--not
the
what
that
we
preferred?
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
it
was
us
that
moved
to
transfer
it
back
to
pennsylvania
because
obviously,
given
the
residence
of
the
plaintiffs,
it
would
be
more
convenient
for
them
to
try
the
case
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
that
is
correct.
we
were
not
guaranteed
that
we
would
be
able
to
come
back
to
pennsylvania
however.
our
first
choice,
and
our
duty
as
counsel
for
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
was
to
file
the
case
in
an
appropriate
and
proper
forum.
and
we
did
that.
then,
because
it
would
be
more
convenient
for
them,
we
filed
a
motion
seeking
to
make
the
case
more
conveniently
tried
by
bringing
it
back
to
pennsylvania.
we
never
contended
that
we
had
an
absolute
right
to
bring
it
back
to
pennsylvania.
it
was
up
to
the
district
court
in
mississippi
to
weigh
the
various
factors
and
decide
whether
or
not--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--well,
your
honor,
there
has
been
a
brief
submitted
by
amicus
curiae
in
this
case
suggesting
that
with
respect
to
plaintiff-initiated
motions
to
transfer,
there
are
numerous
factors
that
should
be
considered,
whether
there
has
been
some
change
in
the
plaintiff's
situation.
it
suggests
also
that,
because
it
is
the
plaintiff
that
has
made
the
original
choice,
that
the
plaintiff's
initial
selection
should
generally
govern,
unless
the
plaintiff
can
show,
by
a
preponderance
of
evidence
or
arguments,
that
the
case
should
be
transferred.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
well,
in
a
way
we
don't
know
what
militates
against
it
because
the
respondent
didn't
oppose
it.
the
respondent
didn't
come
in
and
say
these
are
the
reasons
we
think
this
case
shouldn't
be
transferred.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
i
think
that
issue,
your
honor,
has
been
resolved
in
the
van
dusen
case,
because
one
of
the
questions
there
was
what
it
means...
what
that
particular
phraseology
means,
where
it
might
have
been
brought.
and
if
i
recall
correctly,
the
court
in
van
dusen
says
that
all
that
means
is
a
jurisdiction
or
venue
and...
a
forum
where
jurisdiction
and
venue
are
appropriate,
even
if
it
may
have
resulted
in
less
favorable
law.
i
don't
think
that
there
was
any
basis
for
denying
a
transfer
to
pennsylvania--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--i
agree.
if
i
understand
your
question
correctly,
i
agree.
we
are
not
here
to
resolve
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
motion
should
have
been
granted.
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
it
was
granted.
the
question
that
we
are
here
to
decide
today
is
what
law
is
applicable.
it
is
our
position
that
this
court
should
adopt
a
uniform
law
that
says,
and
this
is
language,
this
is
basically
taking
language
from
the
stewart
organization
case,
which
admittedly
was
dictum,
it
was
not
the
holding,
but
in
stewart
organization
this
court
indicated
that
a
transfer
pursuant
to
section
1404
carries
with
it
no
change
in
the
applicable
law.
that
should
be
the
rule
this
court
adopts
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
no,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
it
does
not.
this
case
should
have
been--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--because
the
case
would
have
been
tried
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
mississippi--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--following
the
transfer
it
would
have
still
be
tried
under
the
united...
under
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--well,
there
would
have
been...
you
are
suggesting
there
would
have
been
different
procedural
rules
that
would
have
applied?
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
exactly,
your
honor.
the
only
difference--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--no...
there
would
have
been,
or
there
could
have
been
some
minimal
change
in
the
application
of
the
local
rules.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
it
depends
on
whether
you
are
looking
at
that
for
erie
purposes
or
for
other
purposes.
for
erie
purposes
it
is
considered
substantive.
it
is
outcome
determinative.
therefore,
the
southern...
case--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--for
transfer
purposes
i
believe
it
should
be
still
be
treated
as
substantive.
it
is
part
of
the
mississippi
law
that
should
have
been
applied
and
continued
to
have
been
applied
after
the
case
was
transferred
pursuant
to
a
procedural
statute
providing
for
such
transfers
at
the
convenience...
for
the
convenience
of
the
parties
and
in
the
interest
of
justice.
i
would
also
like
to
address
the
third
circuit's
opinion
and
the
basis
upon
which
the
third
circuit
decided
this
case.
the
third
circuit's
opinion
apparently
reflects
its
feeling
that
this
case
constituted
improper
forum
shopping.
that
is
clearly
inaccurate
in
this
case.
the
plaintiffs
exercised
their
venue
privilege
properly.
they
brought
suit
in
an
appropriate
forum--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--it's
the
selection...
it's
the
selection
of
a
forum,
that
is
right.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
it's
proper
forum...
there
is
nothing
improper
about
the
initial
selection
of
the
forum--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--and
the
case...
and
the
petitioners
cannot
therefore
be
criticized
in
this
case
for
bringing
suit
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi.
that
was
clearly
appropriate.
that
simply
leaves
the
question
of
whether
or
not
transferring
the
case
back
to
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
constituted
impermissible
forum
shopping.
clearly--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--but
it
doesn't
determine
how
this
case
comes
out,
your
honor.
that
is
just
the
point.
no
matter
where
this
case
was...
was
tried,
it
should
have
been
the
law
of
mississippi
was
applicable
and
should
have
been
applied.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
let
me...
let
me
clarify
that.
mississippi
choice
of
law--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--well--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
but
that,
in
sun
oil--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--that
is
exactly
correct.
what
we
are
really
talking
about
here
is--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--choice
of
law.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
or
choice,
yes.
mississippi
conflicts
law,
mississippi
choice
of
law.
and
under
mississippi's
choice
of
law
they
would
have
applied
their
own
statute,
but
they
would
have
applied
the
substantive
law
of
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania,
because
that
is
where
the
cause
of
action
arose.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
could
we
have
transferred
it
to
hawaii?
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
not
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
believe
that
venue
or
jurisdiction
would
have
been
appropriate
in
hawaii.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
that
is
a
question
to
which
i
don't
know
the
answer,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
well,
right...
the
basis
of
transferring
is
the
district
court's
determination
of
factors
of
convenience
to
the
parties
and
witnesses,
and
the
interest
of
justice.
not
whether
or
not--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--there
were
no
parties
in
mississippi,
your
honor,
that
is
why
factors
of
convenience
to
the
parties
in
this
case
warranted
transferring--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
because
the
plaintiffs
properly
exercised
the
venue
privilege.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
they
do
business
down
there.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
john
deere
was
in
mississippi,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
yes,
it
does.
john
deere
was
an
appropriate...
was
appropriately
brought
into
this
case
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
your
honor,
we
feel
that
it
is
appropriate
for
this
court
to
adopt
a
rule
limited
to
where
situations
where
venue
and
jurisdiction
are
proper
in
the
original
forum,
which
provides
that
a
transfer
under
section
1404
carries
with
it
no
change
in
the
applicable
law,
regardless
of
whether
it
is
the
plaintiff
or
the
defendant
that
makes
the
motion.
and
we
believe
that
the
reasoning
of
this
court
in
van
dusen
supports
that
position.
and
the
considerations
of
the
section
1404,
its
purposes
and
its
express
language,
also
support
that
conclusion.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--but
in
sun
oil
company
v.
wortman,
this
court
has
already
said
that
that
is
appropriate
if
the
case
is
initiated
in
that
particular
state.
that's
constitutional.
that
question
is
beyond
any
dispute.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
if
there
are
no
other
questions
from
the
court
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
thank
you,
your
honor.
there
are
just
three
points
that
i
would
like
to
touch
on
very
briefly.
justice
scalia's
interest
of
justice
analysis,
i
think,
results
in
this
case
in
the
requirement
that
the
third
circuit's
decision
be
reversed
and
this
case
be
remanded
to
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
for
trial.
and
if
the
court
adopts
the
position,
or
at
least
the
suggestion,
that
justice
scalia
has
indicated
from
his
questioning,
i
think
that
that
is
the
appropriate
outcome
in
this
particular
case.
i
wanted
to
address
something
that
justice
stevens
was
talking
about,
asking
in
terms
of
what
enlargement
of
rights
is
there
from
the
transfer
of
the
case
from
the
southern
district
of
mississippi
back
to
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania.
as
your
honor
pointed
out,
there
is
no
enlargement
of
rights.
there
is
only
one
benefit
to
the
plaintiff
in
this
particular
case;
it
is
more
convenient.
and
lo
and
behold,
you
look
at
section
1404
and
what
does
it
say,
for
the
convenience
of
the
parties.
the
transfer
of
the
case
was
for
the
express
purposes
set
forth
in
the
statute.
if
you
listen
to
the
arguments
that
are
being
made
by
the
respondents,
they
are
all
in
favor
of
discouraging
plaintiffs
from
utilizing
forums
which
would
be
properly
available
for
them
under
the
venue
statutes
set
forth
in
the
judicial
code.
how
are
they
going
to
discourage
that?
they
are
going
to
discourage
it
by
making
it
inconvenient
and
expensive
for
plaintiffs
to
try
cases
in
those
forums.
again,
i
submit
that
any
argument
that
fosters
an
application
of
section
1404
against
the
convenience
is--
mr.
richard
b.
tucker,
iii
--thank
you,
your
honor.
