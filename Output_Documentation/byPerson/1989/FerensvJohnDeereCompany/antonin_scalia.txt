justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
could
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
there
any
basis
to
do
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
once
the
rule
is
adopted
it
wouldn't
defeat
the
venue
privilege,
would
it?
i
mean,
the
plaintiff
would
simply
know
that
if...
that
going
in
he
was
going
to
have
to
make
a
choice
between
getting
the
law
of
the
place
where
he
brought
the
suit
or
getting
the
more
convenient
forum.
i
mean,
it
wouldn't
be
defeating
anything...
maybe
in
this
one
case
it
would,
but
once
we
announce
what
the
rule
is,
the
plaintiff's
expectations
will
be
very
clear.
he
can
either
pick
the
law
and
live
with
it
in
that
forum,
or
he
can
pick
the
more
convenient
forum
and
get
the
law
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
be
a
sensible
enough
rule,
but
all
i
am
suggesting
is
that
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
an
accurate
description
to
say
we
are
taking
away,
or
we
would
be
taking
away,
the
plaintiff's,
the
plaintiff's
venue
selection
right
if
we
held
that
if,
on
his
initiative,
he
wants
to
trade
that
for
a
more
convenient
forum,
he
has
to
trade
the
law
along
with
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
an
unreasonable
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
it
was
a
defeat.
there
you
couldn't
have
said
well,
the
plaintiff
was
just
put
to
a
trade.
he
was
given
the
option
of
you
stick
with
your
choice
of
law
with
the
venue,
or
you
can
get
a
more
convenient
forum
but
you
will
have
to
give
up
the
choice
of
law.
he
didn't
have
that
choice,
because
it
was
the
defendant
in
that
case
who
was
trying
to
do
him
out
of
his
selection
of
law.
he
was
perfectly
happy
to
litigate
there,
and
the
defendant
was
depriving
him
of
it.
all
that
your
opponent
is
proposing
here
is
that
your
client
be
put
to
his
choice:
pick
your
law
or
pick
the
convenient
forum,
but
don't
try
to
have
both.
isn't
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
it
is
as
clear
as
that,
why
would
we
reserve
the
question,
as
we
did
explicitly?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
proper
forum
shopping,
right?
not
improper
forum
shopping.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
forum
shopping.
if
indeed
you
have
the
option,
you
say
all
forum
shopping
is
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
to
do
it,
and
you
certainly
served
your
client
well,
but
i
wouldn't
go
around
bragging
about
a
judicial
system
that
allows
that
kind
of
thing
to
determine
how
a
case
comes
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
the
whole
thing
only
arises,
really,
because
federal
courts
for
erie
choice
of
law
purposes
treat
the
statute
of
limitations
as
substantive,
whereas
the
mississippi
court,
for
its
choice
of
law
purposes,
treats
the
statute
of
limitations
as
procedural.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
is
that
difference
that
creates
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--unusual
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
we
could...
we
could
get
the
same
good
results
that
you
want
to
achieve
by
following
the
same
rule
that
we
follow
in
van
dusen,
but
simply
saying
that
if...
if
the
result
will
be
to
have
this
state's
law
applied
in
another
forum
where
the...
where
the
suit
could
not
have
been
brought,
don't
allow
the
transfer.
i
mean,
that
is
another
way
to
achieve
the
same
good
results
that
you
are
after,
couldn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
is
your
way
better?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
think
the
other
result
would
discourage
them
just
as
much.
they
know
that
if
they
file
it
there
they
are
going
to
have
to
try
it
there,
and
so...
and
your
system
would
do
the
same
thing.
if
you
file
it
in
mississippi
you
are
going
to
have
to
try
it
in
mississippi.
you
can't
try
it
anywhere
else.
it
seems
to
me
you
could
achieve
that
result
in
two
ways,
either
by
saying
mississippi
law
doesn't
follow
you
back
to
pennsylvania,
or
by
saying
you
simply
can't
get
it
back
to
pennsylvania,
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
means
van
dusen
is
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it
needs
to
hold
that
to
buy
the
argument
that
you
just
made.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
crossed
that
bridge,
that
this
thing
tracks
forum
nonconvenience.
we...
we've
crossed
that
bridge
when
we
decided
van
dusen
the
way
we
did.
because
we
decided
in
van
dusen
that
it
does
not
produce
the
result
that
forum
nonconvenience
dismissal
would
produce.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
know
that,
but
i
want
to
know
what
my
options
are.
i
mean,
if
i
say
there
is
another
more
texturally
permissible
way
of
meeting
all
of
your
objections,
then
i'm...
then
i
would
find
against
you,
i
hate
to
tell
you.
