mr.
david
p.
helwig
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
facts
upon
which
petitioners'
claim
is
based
have
everything
to
do
with
pennsylvania
and
nothing
to
do
with
mississippi.
the
only
reason
why
any
court
would
have
ever
even
considered
that
mississippi's
statute
of
limitations
should
apply
was
that
petitioners
apparently
intended
to
litigate
their
action
there.
by
moving
to
transfer
the
action
to
pennsylvania,
petitioners
have
abandoned
mississippi
as
a
forum
for
choice
of
law
purposes,
and
by
so
doing
have
eliminated
the
only
reason
which
ever
existed
for
applying
mississippi
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
well,
i
think
that
is
the
issue
that
has
to
be
decided,
but
the
reason
i
make
that
point
is
i
think
the
threshold
inquiry
is
to
ask
why
as
a
choice
of
law
matter
does
a
court
select
one
statute
of
limitations
or
one
choice
of
law
rule
over
another
choice
of
law
rule.
with
regard
to
statutes
of
limitation,
it's
simply
the
general
rule,
or
the
basic
principle
to
which
both
pennsylvania
and
mississippi
subscribe,
is
that
they
will
apply
their
own
statute
of
limitations,
or
their
own
choice
of
law
rules
selecting
statutes
of
limitation,
in
a
case
which
is
pending
in
that
forum.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
right.
and
guarantee
trust
requires
that
the
district
court
apply
whatever
statute
of
limitations
that
the
state
court
in
the
state
in
which
it
was
sitting
would
have
applied.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
absolutely,
and
that
is
what
the
court
held
in
wortman.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
i
am
not
suggesting
that
there...
and
in
fact
the
court
has
held
by
its
earlier
grant
of
certiorari
in
vacating
the
third
circuit's
prior
judgment,
that
mississippi's
choice
of
law
rule
is
not
to
be
overthrown.
and
that
is
not
what
we
are
arguing
about.
but
in
wortman,
the
point
isn't...
i
think
the
crucial
point
in
wortman
is
yes,
the
states
are
free
to
apply
whatever
choice
of
law
rules
they
choose
to
with
regard
to
statute
of
limitations.
but,
on
the
other
hand,
it
doesn't
mean...
the
court
held
that
you
don't
federalize
the
choice
of
law
rules.
you
limit
the
application
to
a
particular
state,
neither
due
process
nor
full
faith
and
credit
require
the
federal
courts
to
invalidate
a
given
state's
choice
of
law
rule.
and
here
the
rule
we
are
really
concerned
with
is
pennsylvania's
choice
of
law
rule,
because
for
all
practical
purposes
that
is
where
petitioners
have
chosen
to
litigate
their
claim,
not
mississippi.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
absolutely,
van
dusen
would--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--i
believe
that,
in
light
of
van
dusen
and
in
light
of
the
applicable
choice
of
law
rules,
that
you
would
apply
the
transferor
forum's
choice
of
law
rules,
because
the
original
forum
is
still--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--the
forum
which
the
plaintiff
had
selected
in
which
to
litigate
their
claim.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
i...
that
raises
a
problem
of
getting
into
subjective
intent
of
the
plaintiff,
and
i
don't
think...
i
think
you
really
have
to
look
to
what
happens
on
the
record.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
well--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--he
had
a
right
to
file
in
mississippi,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
he's
not
pursuing
his
claim
in
mississippi
when
he,
when
he
is
the
one
who
seeks
the
transfer.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
well,
i
think
that
would
be
the
desirable
result
of--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--well,
i
think
the
result
as
a
practical
matter
is
that
it
will
serve...
a
ruling
in
favor
of
respondent
will
create
a
prophylactic
rule
that
basically
discourages--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--plaintiffs
from
even
filing
in
inconvenient
forums,
except
in
the
situation
where
that
is
there
only
forum
as
a
practical
matter
because--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
well,
it
will
also
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
well,
if
it
is
a
joint
motion
i
think,
again,
that
the
plaintiff
has
eliminated
the
reason
for
applying
the
original
forum's
statute
of
limitations,
namely
the
selection
of
that
forum
as
the
one
in
which
to
go
forward
with
the
litigation.
so
i
think
wherever
the
plaintiff
abandons
that
forum,
you
eliminate
the
basic
choice
of
law
principle
that
would
support
application
of
that
forum's
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
that
is
another
way
to
achieve
the
same
result.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
well,
you
won't
have...
i
think
my
way
is
better
because
you
won't
have
the
inconvenient
forum,
the
inconvenient
filings
in
the
first
place,
except
in
instances
where
that
is
the
only
state
where
a
statute
of
limitations
would
allow
the
litigation
to
be
pursued.
but
you
won't
have--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--well,
the
problem
with
that
view
of
not
allowing
it
to
go
back
to
pennsylvania
is
that
that
result
is
not
really
conducive
to
the
convenience
of
the
parties,
the
witnesses
or
the
interests
of
justice
to
have
these
lawsuits
marooned
down
in
the
some
inconvenient
forum.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
well,
i...
i
think
it
is
the
petitioner
who
is
the
one
wanting
to
have
it
both
ways,
not
the
respondent.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
that
is
true.
i
was
wondering
whether
they
might
file
an
amicus
brief
in
support
of
our
position,
but
that
was
not
forthcoming.
however,
i'd
like
to
get
to
a
point
beyond
statute--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor,
effective
july
1
of
1989.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
correct,
as
the--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--well,
i
believe
that
it
hasn't
reached
this
court.
i
think
in
the
schreiber
v.
allis-chalmers
case
that
the,
i
think
it
was
the
tenth
circuit,
validated
the
constitutionality.
the
third
circuit
questioned
the
constitutionality
of
the
mississippi
statute
of
limitations
across
the
board,
but
of
course
this
court
reversed
that
particular
judgment
by
the
third
circuit.
also,
justice
kennedy,
you
asked
about
did
the...
did
a
change
in
law
have
any...
anything
to
do
with
convenience.
and
i
think
petitioners'
counsel
said
it
should
not.
but
in
fact
in
van
dusen
i
think
the
court
expressly
addressed
that
question,
because
in
van
dusen,
in
ruling
on
the
transfer
motion,
the
district
court
said
it
should
make
no
difference
whatsoever
whether
you
have...
a
change
in
the
applicable
law.
and
i
think
that
this
court
expressly
stated
that
that
was
an
incorrect
mode
of
analysis,
so
i
wanted
to
address
that
point.
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
on
discussion
in
petitioners'
argument
about
the
notion
that
section
1404(a)
has
been
described
as
a
judicial
housekeeping
measure,
and
i
have
the
sense
that
petitioner
was
attempting
to
substitute
labeling
for
analysis.
now,
this
court
long
ago
in
the
context
of
the
erie
jurisprudence
rejected
labeling
as
a
matter
of
determining
the
way
a
particular
case
should
be
resolved.
that
is,
labeling
as
substantive
or
labeling
as
procedural
can't
take
the
place
of
analysis.
certainly
it
is
a
judicial
housekeeping
measure,
and
in
this
court
van
dusen...
in
van
dusen
this
court
held
that
it
is
a
judicial
housekeeping
measure
that
wasn't
intended
to
destroy
state
choice
of
law
advantages.
but
equally,
it
is
a
judicial
housekeeping
measure
that
wasn't
intended
to
enlarge
those
state
choice
of
law
advantages
and
affect
federal
law--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--it
is
something
that
plaintiff
could
never
have
had
in
pennsylvania.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
yes,
it
was...
we
did
not
oppose
the
motion.
in
fact,
i
think
there
were
no
valid
grounds
under
section
1404(a)
for
opposition.
i
think
it
enlarges
the
petitioners'
rights
as
a
simple
geographical
matter.
yes,
it
is
a
right
that
they
could
have
had
in
mississippi
[inaudible]
anywhere
else--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--but
so
far
as
the
statute
of
limitations
is
concerned,
an
exactly
opposite
result--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--i
am
saying
that
section
1404(a),
in
all
likelihood
when
the
congress
enacted
it,
they
had
no
intent
so
far
as
which
forum's
choice
of
law
rules
should
apply
following
transfer.
and
given--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--if
the
defendant
had
made
the
transfer
it
may
have
been
granted
on
condition
that
the
statute
of
limitations
be
waived.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
defendant,
however,
did
not
make
the
motion.
that
is
the
point
of
the
statute.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
yes.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
of
course,
under
forum
nonconvenience
you
didn't
have
plaintiffs
making
motions
to
dismiss.
they
could
simply
institute
the
action
in
another
forum--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--which
forum
would
apply
its
own
choice
of
law
rules,
not
those
of
whatever
the
original
forum
had
been.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
and
that
would
be
the
effect...
generally
as
to
choice
of
law
rules
in
the
case
of
a
forum
nonconvenience
dismissal
on
defendant's
motion,
would
be
that
in
the
second
lawsuit
the
second
forum's
choice
of
law
rules
would
apply
generally,
not
the
original
forum's.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
certainly
arguments
that
can
be
made
that
van
dusen
was
incorrectly
decided.
but
i
do
not
think
this
court
needs
to
hold
that
in
order
to
affirm
the
third
circuit's
judgment
in
favor
of
john
deere.
in
fact,--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--that...
that
has
been
decided,
and
i
am
not
taking
a
position
that
van
dusen
should
be
overruled.
it
does...
i
was
in
the
course
of
just
attempting
to
respond
to
justice
stevens'
question.
but
i
want
to
make
abundantly
clear
that
it
is
not
our
position
that
van
dusen
needs
to
be
overruled.
the
third
circuit,
i
believe,
relied
on
van
dusen
in
rendering
a
judgment
in
favor
of
john
deere
company
in
this
case.
i...
if
you
read
their
opinion,
they
said
it
was
petitioners'
interpretation
of
section
1404(a)
that
was
inconsistent
with
van
dusen.
the
court
had
good
reason
in
van
dusen
for
reserving
the
question
of
what
the
effect
would
be
of
a
plaintiff-initiated
transfer.
it
wasn't
just
dealt
with
by
ignoring
the
issue.
the
court
went
out
and
said
there
may
be
other
considerations
in
the
case
of
a
plaintiff-initiated
transfer.
and
i
think
those
other
considerations
are
readily
apparent
by
the
fact...
become
readily
apparent
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
i
think
van
dusen's
mode
of
analysis
as
far
as
statutory
construction
actually,
again,
supports
the
third
circuit's
judgment
in
favor
of
respondent
in
this
case.
that
mode
of
analysis
being
in
the
absence
of
a
discernible
legislative
intent
or
congressional
intent
to
change
law
we
are
going
to
maintain
the
status
quo.
it
is
a
hands-off
approach,
but
it
should
be
a
hands-off
approach
no
matter
who
seeks
the
transfer.
and
the
hands-off
approach
in
the
case
of
a
defendant-initiated
transfer
leaves
one
with
the
application
of
pennsylvania's
law.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
i
agree,
and
i
am
constrained
to
agree
by
this
court's
previous
vacation
of
the
third
circuit's
prior
order,
and
also
by
the
sun
oil
holding.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
the
case
belongs
in
pennsylvania.
i
don't
think
there
is
any
question
about
that.
that
is
where
it
always
belonged.
the
only
reason
it
got
into
mississippi
was
that
petitioner
slept
on
his
rights,
not
just
more
than
two
years,
but
actually
more
than
three
years
from
the
date
of
his
injury--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--i
don't...
well,
to
attempt
to
take
advantage,
your
honor.
i
think
that
certainly
van
dusen
explicitly
reserved
the
question.
and
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
i
am
intending
no
criticism
of
petitioners'
counsel.
in
fact,
as
i
understand
the
matter,
they
did
not
have
this
case--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--i
think...
that
is
exactly
the
point
i
think
needs
to
be
made,
is
that
i
think
i
would
be
obligated
at
a
minimum
to
advise
a
person
who
walked
into
my
office
with
a
claim
that
was
time
barred
under
pennsylvania,
that
even
if
i
didn't
want
to
it
for
the
for
whatever
reason,
that
they
had
a
right
to
pursue
that
claim
in
mississippi.
just
as
i
think
you
would
be
obligated
to
advise
someone
who,
some
other
procedural...
some
other
choice
of
law
rule
that
the
forum
considers
to
be
procedural,
advise
that
person,
hey,
maybe
you
should
go
to
a
state
where
the
burden
of
proof
is
different
or
the
rule
on
presumption
is
different.
i
think
that
professional
duty
extends
to
counsel
with
respect
to
all
these
legal
rules
that
many
forums
consider
to
be
procedural
for
choice
of
law
purposes,
but
which
erie
requires
their
application
because
they
so
affect
the
outcome
of
the
case.
and
i...
that
raises,
or
that
gets
into
the
possibility
that
i
have
raised.
that
if
petitioners'
interpretation
of
section
1404(a)
is
adopted,
the...
it's
an
inducement
to
plaintiffs
to
attempt
to
capture
this
wide
variety
of
choice
of
law
rules
that
are
considered
to
be
procedural.
it
is
not
just
a
statute
of
limitations
situation,
that
presumptions,
burden
of
proof,
burden
of
production,
sufficiency
of
evidence
and
statute
of
frauds
are
all
considered
by
many
forums
to
be
procedural.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
but
by
filing
in
an
inconvenient
forum
with
favorable
choice
of
law
rules,
the
petitioner
hopes
to
capture
those
rules.
and
if
he
has
an
unrestricted--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--no,
i
think,
you
know--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--there...
there
wouldn't
be
as
compelling
a
reason,
because
obviously
the
statute
of
limitations
is
dispositive
of
the
claim.
but
rules
such
as
those
on
presumptions,
burden
of
proof,
et
cetera,
can
significantly
out...
affect
the
outcome
of
a
case.
that
is
why
erie
requires
that
they
be
applied
in
diversity
actions.
so
there
would
be
a
reason
to
seek
out
those
rules,
and
i
think
the
plaintiff--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--if
that
forum
is
the
one
that
has
the
rule--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--then
you
would
seek
it
out.
and
i
think
the
plaintiff's
bar
in
this
country,
consistent
with
their
obligations
under
the
code
of
professional
responsibility,
is
highly
diligent,
highly
organized.
you
get
a
database,
it
would
be
a
very
simple
matter
to
catalogue
all
of
these
favorable
choice
of
law
rules
which
the
forums
consider
procedural--
mr.
david
p.
helwig
--well,
if
we're...
if
the
judgment
is
affirmed,
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
duty...
well,
yes,
you
could
say
you
can
do
that,
but
you'll
have
to
stay
there.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
unless
defendant
moves
to
transfer.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
well,
the
first
answer
to
that
question
is
the
issue
which
has
been
granted...
of
which
review
has
been
granted,
is
what
happens
when
there
is
a
transfer,
not
whether
or
not
transfer
should
be
granted.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
i
think
that
the
alternative
view,
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
would
also
create
a
desirable
prophylactic
rule
to
discourage
these
kinds
of
filings,
which
i
really
think
do
constitute
the
sort
of
impermissible
forum
shopping
that
both
van
dusen
and
erie
are
concerned
with.
as
a
pro...
but
as
a
matter
of
common
sense,
i
agree
with
you,
that
also
would
be
a
desirable
prophylactic
rule.
i
do
have
some
question,
however,
whether
there
really
is
a
basis
in
the
statute
for
treating
plaintiff-initiated
transfers
differently
from
defendant-initiated
transfers
as
far
as
the
standards
to
be
applied.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
see
that
there,
although
as
a
common
sense
way
of
dealing
with
the
question,
i
think
it
has
much
to
commend
it.
mr.
david
p.
helwig
well,
there
is...
i
am
not
saying
that
the
question
of
choice
of
law
couldn't
be
taken
into
consideration
under
that
heading,
but
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
be
entitled
to
dispositive
weight
because
you
do
have
these
other
factors
which,
as
in
this
particular
case,
everything
about
the
case
is
back
in
pennsylvania.
so,
it
wouldn't...
the
interest
of
justice
approach
wouldn't
necessarily
compel
the
district
court
to
deny
the
transfer
motion.
i
really,
unless
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
respectfully
request
the
court
to
affirm
the
third
circuit's
judgment
in
favor
of
john
deere
company.
