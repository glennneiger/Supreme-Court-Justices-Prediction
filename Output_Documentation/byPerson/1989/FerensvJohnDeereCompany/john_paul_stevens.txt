justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
there
an
argument
based
on
the
language
of
the
statute
that
might
militate
against
it?
the
statute
says
that
you
may
transfer
it
to
any
other
district
or
division
where
it
might
have
been
brought.
now,
technically
it
could
have
been
brought
and
then
dismissed
on
statute
of
limitations
grounds,
but
there
is
a
pretty
good
argument
that
it
could
not
have
been
maintained
in
the
district
in
pennsylvania.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
surely
expresses
the
suggestion
from
congress
that
one
of
the
things
that
the
transferring
judge
should
consider
is
whether
or
not
the
litigation
could
have
gone
forward
in
that
case...
in
that
state.
and
i
would
think
the
question,
the
questions
presented
by
this
particular
certiorari
petition
is
quite
different
from
the
question
whether
there
might
be
a
basis
for
refusing
a
transfer.
this
judge
might
say
well,
you
picked
this
forum,
i
am
going
to
hold
you
to
your
choice.
you
couldn't
have
sued
up
in
pennsylvania.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say
they
have
abandoned
them
because
that
is
the
issue
we
have
to
decide,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
if
it
is
pending
in
a
state
court
it
would
have
been
filed
in
the
state
court,
too.
this
is
a
peculiarly
federal
problem.
it
only
arises
because
federal
courts
sit
in
both
jurisdictions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
acknowledge
the
case
would
be
different
if
the
defendant
had
moved
for
the
transfer,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if...
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
plaintiffs
or
defendants.
supposing
the
judge
had
ordered
the
transfer
on
the
judge's
own
motion.
what
rule
would
you
apply
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
plaintiff--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
in
that
case
you
would
treat
that
like
a
defendant-initiated
transfer.
what
if
the
plaintiff
went
up
to
the
judge
after...
say
you
win
this
case,
the
plaintiff
went...
the
plaintiff's
lawyer
to
the
judge
and
said
judge,
i
can't
make
a
motion
because
if
i
do
the
case
will
be
dismissed
when
it
is
transferred,
but
i
think
you
should
know
that
most
of
the
witnesses
live
in
pennsylvania
and
it
just
makes
a
lot
more
sense
to
have
the
case
tried
up
there.
maybe
you'll
want
to
ask
the
defendant
what
their
views
are
on
a
transfer.
would
that...
would
that
cause
it
to
be
a
plaintiff-initiated
transfer
if
he
didn't
actually
make
a
formal
motion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
you
would
limit
it
to
the
case
where
the
judge
calls
the
parties
in
and
says
hey,
this
looks
kind
of
silly,
we're
trying
a
case
in
mississippi
when
all
the
witnesses
and
the
parties
are
in
pennsylvania.
does
anybody
object
if
i
transfer
the
case?
i
have
had
that
happen
in
trials.
and
you
would
say
that
would
be
treated
like
a
defendant-initiated
transfer?
and
if
you
do
say
that,
why
should
there
be
a
different
rule
if
the
plaintiff
calls
the
same
considerations
to
the
attention
of
the
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
should
that
be
a
waiver
of
the
right
to
file
in
mississippi,
which
you
acknowledge
he
had?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
would
if
the
motion
were
denied.
he
would
if
the
motion
were
denied,
wouldn't
he?
and
if
you
prevail
in
all
these
cases
they
just
won't
make
the
motion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
desirable
result
then
we
would
have
all
these
pennsylvania
lawsuits
ought
to
be
tried
in
mississippi.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right,
it
will
discourage
these
motions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
does
this
enlarge
them?
i
don't
understand
that.
if
the
case
is
properly
filed
in
mississippi,
and
you
apply
mississippi
rules
which
pick
up
all
of
pennsylvania
law
except
the
statute
of
limitations,
how
does
the
transfer
change
that?
how
does
that
enlarge
the
plaintiffs'
legal
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
couldn't
have
had
it
except
for
this
peculiar
rule
that
you
can
sue
in
mississippi
and
no
place
else
because
they
have
a
long
statute
of
limitations
and
they
have
this,
they
treat
it
as
substantive...
or
procedural;
i've
stated
it
backwards.
but
that
is
the
peculiarity
in
the
case.
but
once
you
say
they
have
gotten
into
mississippi
properly,
how
can
you
say
they
have
enlarged
the
rights
they
have
in
mississippi
by
transferring
to
pennsylvania,
which
is
a
more
convenient
place
to
try
the
lawsuit?
including
more
convenient
for
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
a
right,
that
is
a
matter
of
convenience.
that
is
convenience.
the
rights
are
precisely
the
same.
the
convenience
is
much
different.
the
convenience
for
the
judge,
for
you
and
for
the
plaintiff
and
for
the
witnesses.
but
that...
the
rights
are
exactly
the
same.
the
same
testimony
would
go
into
the
record,
the
same
documents
will
be
introduced
and
the
same
instructions
will
be
given
to
the
jury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
not
a
function
of
the
transfer.
that
is
because
he
could
file
in
mississippi.
well,
you
are
saying
it
should
be
a
function
of
the
transfer.
that
is
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
intended,
didn't
they,
to
adopt
basically
old
doctrine
of
forum
nonconvenience.
and
under
the
old
doctrine,
if
this...
if
mississippi
is
a
very
inconvenient
forum,
they
might
transfer
it
to
pennsylvania.
but
i
don't
think
a
judge
would
have
transferred
it
to
pennsylvania
if
the
judgment
said
look,
as
a
result
of
this
transfer
they
are
going
to
have
to
dismiss
the
action.
because
it
would
throw
one
party
out
of
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
before
the
statute
was
passed
under
the
forum
nonconvenience
doctrine,
it
was
simply
a
motion
to
dismiss.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
understanding
it
would
be
refiled
in
another
forum.
and
i
am
just
suggesting,
i
don't
think
the
judge
would
have
granted
the
motion
if
the
price
of
granting
the
motion
was
to
terminate
the
lawsuit
under
forum
nonconvenience
principles,
which
this
statute
was
basically
intended
to
reenact.
you...
go
ahead--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
is
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
in
all
except
the
statute
of
limitations
situation
there
is
no
deterrent
to
just
filing
in
the
forum
you
want
to
stand
up
in.
it
is
really
only
the
statute
of
limitations
problem
that
would
cause
him
to
file
where
he
hopes
he
doesn't
have
to
try
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
transfer
to
the
more
convenient
forum.
but
i
am
saying
these
other
favorable
choice
of
law
rules,
he
would
just
go
ahead
and
sue
in
pennsylvania,
if
it
weren't
for
the
statute
of
limitations
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
no...
really
no
reason
to
go
to
forum
a
and
then
hope
the
judge
will
transfer
you
to
forum
b
if
you
could
have
sued
in
forum
b
in
the
first
place.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there
is
not
a
reason
to
seek
out
an
inconvenient
forum
if
you
want
those
rules.
you
would
want
the
rules
that
you
would
stick
with.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see
what
you
are
saying.
i
see
what
you
are
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
even
if
you
win
this
case
you
would
still
have
the
obligation
to
use
the
same
database
and
pick
the
most...
the
forum
where
you
can
get
all
these
favorable
rules,
and
go
ahead
and
sue
there.
you
would
have
to
advise
the
client
at
least
of
the
possibility
of
suing
in
a
forum
comparable
to
mississippi.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
have
to
try
the
case
there.
that
is
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
well,
but
mr.
helwig,
here
is
what
troubles
me.
i
don't
see
any
basis
in
the
text
of
the
statute
or
anything
else
for
saying
that
you...
federal
court
has
to
apply
one
law
where
the
plaintiff
moves,
another
law
where
the
defendant
moves.
i
mean,
we
would
be
making
that
up.
there
is
just
no
basis
in
there
for
that.
there
is
a
basis
in
the
statute,
however,
for
meeting
the
problem
that
you
are
concerned
about
in
a
different
fashion.
that
is,
for
simply
saying
if
somebody
has
filed
in
a
forum
that
is
an
inconvenient
forum,
and
if
the
affect
of
transferring
it
is
to
send
it
to...
at
his
instance,
is
to...
at
his
instance
is
to
send
it
to
a
forum
where
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
win
had
he
sued
there,
the
court
should
not
allow
the
transfer.
you
have
language
that
permits
that
here,
it
says
in
the
interest
of
justice
a
district
court
may
transfer.
in
other
words,
the
decision
whether
to
transfer
or
not
to
transfer
is
very
much
at
the
discretion
of
the
court,
by...
the
text
of
the
statute.
and
i
feel
sort
of
free
to
follow
my
gut
feeling
which,
frankly,
is
somewhat
like
yours,
that
this
seems
like
a,
you
know,
a
legally
permissible
thing,
but
not
the
kind
of
thing
we
ought
to
encourage.
so
why...
why
shouldn't
i
do
it
that
way
rather
than
by
saying
yes,
you
can
transfer,
but
the...
but
the
law
that
applies
is
the
law
of
the
transferee
forum.
