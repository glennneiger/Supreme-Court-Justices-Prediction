we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
88-1512,
albert
j.
ferens
v.
john
deere
company.
mr.
tucker.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
purpose
of
that
filing
was
to
get
the
benefit
of
the
mississippi
statute
of
limitations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
holding
of
van
dusen
i
don't
believe
is
inconsistent
with
the
result
reached
by
the
third
circuit
here.
are
you,
you
are
saying
some
of
the
language
is--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--your
case
would
have
more,
perhaps,
gut
appeal
to
it
if
you
had
kept
your
so-called
venue
privilege
in
mississippi
and
not
transferred
it
back
to
pittsburgh,
where
the
action...
or
accident
occurred.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it...
is
it
perfectly
clear
under
1404
that
it
is
available
to
plaintiffs
on
the
same
terms
it
is...
as
it
is
to
defendants?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
on
the
same
terms
substantially
as
is
to
defendants?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet
there
is
something
odd
about
this
case.
you
end
up
trying
it
in
pennsylvania,
in
the
district
court
in
pennsylvania,
and
pennsylvania
would
have
said
there
is
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations.
why
should
you
be
able
to
avoid
that
result
by
going
down
to
mississippi,
where
apparently
nobody
intended
to
try
the
case,
and
filing
down
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
not
the
one
which
you
preferred,
once
you
picked
up
your
choice
of
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
i
mean,
it
was
you
that
moved
to
transfer
it
back
to
pennsylvania.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you,
your
first
choice
was
the
preference
as
to
statute
of
limitations,
and
then
if
you
could
get
the
convenience
you
would
get
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet...
yet
what
arguments
could
have
been
made
against
your
motion
for
transfer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
sitting
as
a
district
judge
in
the
southern
district
of
mississippi,
you
know,
the
witnesses
are
in
pennsylvania,
the
accident
occurred
in
pennsylvania.
certainly
there
are
a
lot
of
considerations
that
would
motivate
that
judge
to
grant
the
transfer,
and
it
seems
to
me
very
few
to
militate
against
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
law
of
mississippi
had
absolutely
no
connection
with
the
accident
that
happened
to
your
client,
or
the
facts...
the
only
thing
mississippi
had
to
do
with
it
was
that
john
deere
did
business
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
didn't
state
it
as
i
thought
it
needed
any
clarification.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't...
isn't
that
the
fact,
that
the
only
connection
between
your
client's
case
and
mississippi
was
that
john
deere
did
business
in
mississippi?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
tucker.
mr.
helwig.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
xxx
encourage
them
to
comply
with
the
local
statute
of
limitations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
helwig.
mr.
tucker,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
two
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tucker,
your
time
is
expired.
