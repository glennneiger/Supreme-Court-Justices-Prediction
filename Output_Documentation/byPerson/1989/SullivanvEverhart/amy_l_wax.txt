ms.
amy
l.
wax
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
the
validity
of
longstanding
regulations
known
as
the
netting
regulations
that
set
forth
a
method
for
correcting
errors
in
the
amount
of
benefits
paid
under
two
social
security
act
programs,
the
title
ii
retirement
and
disability
insurance
program,
and
the
title
xvi
supplemental
security
income
program.
the
regulations
authorize
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services
to
add
together
or
net
multiple
past
errors
in
the
amount
of
benefits
paid
to
an
individual
up
to
the
time
that
the
secretary
discovers
that
an
error
has
been
made.
if
that
calculation
reveals
a
net
underpayment,
then
under
the
pertinent
statutory
provisions,
the
secretary
pays
that
amount
to
the
beneficiary.
if
netting
reveals
a
net
overpayment,
then,
before
collecting
the
overpayment
from
the
beneficiary
by
reducing
forthcoming
benefits
or
demanding
a
refund,
the
secretary
must
consider
whether
a
waiver
of
recovery
is
appropriate.
the
tenth
circuit
struck
down
these
regulations
as
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
social
security
act
that
they
implement.
this
court
should
reverse
that
ruling.
the
netting
method
has
been
in
use
for
decades.
it
provides
a
simple,
fair,
and
common
sense
way
to
settle
accounts,
one
that
is
familiar
from
a
wide
variety
of
contexts.
most
important,
the
calculation
of
the
single
net
error
is
fully
consistent
with
congress'
intent
in
creating
the
payment
correction
provisions
and
providing
for
a
waiver
of
recovery
in
certain
limited
circumstances.
netting
guarantees
in
every
case
that
the
government
may
never
reduce
a
person's
forthcoming
benefit
payments
or
demand
an
out-of-pocket
refund
without
providing
an
opportunity
for
a
waiver.
the
netting
regulation
responds
to
congress'
evident
concern
to
ensure
that
no
one
who
was
without
fault
in
causing
the
overpayment
will
be
deprived
of
the
resources
needed
to
pay
for
the
basic
necessities
of
life
by
the
secretary's
act
of
retrieving
the
overpayment.
netting
also
guarantees
that
an
unfortunate
past
mistake
will
not
become
the
occasion
for
the
infliction
of
future
hardship
on
beneficiaries
who
are
without
fault.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
we
are
not
aware
of
any
instances
in
which
the
agency
intentionally
held
open
the
netting
period
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
some
subsequent
underpayment
errors
that
may
have
occurred.
there
are
a
few
instances
mentioned
in
this
litigation
where
the
secretary
has
been...
perhaps
we
should
say
tardy...
in
taking
action
on
overpayments
of
which
he
was
aware.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
i
think
it
might
be...
i'm
not
sure
which
regulation
it
would
violate
for
the
secretary
to
do
that
because
there
is
no
regulation
that
sets
forth
a
time
limit
between
detection
or
suspicion
of
an
overpayment
and
what
we
call
determination
of
an
overpayment.
but
our
policy
and
our
practice,
which
we
feel
is
entitled
to
a
presumption
of
regularity,
is
to
take
no
more
time
than
is
necessary
between
the
time
that
the
secretary
first
becomes
aware
of
an
error
and
actually
resolves
that
error
to
the
point
where
he's
in
the
position
to
demand
overpayment.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
respectfully,
we
don't
think
that
a
class
action
that
facially
challenges
the
validity
of
our
netting
regulation
as
inconsistent
with
the
statute
would
be
the
vehicle
in
which
to
challenge
what
an
individual
recipient
perceives
is
tardiness,
or
to
the
point
of
arbitrary
and
capricious
tardiness,
in
resolving
their
overpayment.
we
think
that
the
proper
recourse
is
an
individual
lawsuit
where
the
secretary
can
defend
himself.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--the...
well,
we
think
that
it
would
be
arbitrary
for
the
secretary
to
do
that.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
to
deliberately
sit
on
an
overpayment.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that's
the--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--there
is
a
law
against
his
making
future
underpayments
deliberately,
yes.
that
would
violate
the
provisions
of
the
statute
that
set
the
substantive
level.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that's
correct.
to
the
extent
that
the
statute
says
that
whenever
he
determines
that
an
error
has
been
made,
then
he
shall
make
it
up.
and
to
the
extent
that
that
would
imply
the
duty
to
make
it
up
in
a
timely
fashion
and
not
to
use
it
to
manipulate
the
situation,
we
agree.
but
justice
scalia's
point
is
well
worth
noting.
the
secretary...
it
would
be
a
very
inefficient
way
to
collect
underpayments
to
sort
of
sit
around
waiting
for
overpayment...
oh,
excuse
me,
for
underpayments
to
accrue
that
he
can
put
together
with
those
overpayments.
the
fact
is
that
most
people
do
pay
back
their
overpayments.
the
vast
majority
of
overpayments
can
be
collected
by
the
secretary
in
a
fairly
prompt
manner.
so
it
would
not
be
in
the
secretary's
interest
to
delay
processing
those
overpayments
on
the
speculation
that
underpayments
might
crop
up
later
that
he
could
net
with
them.
and
we
make
that
point
in
our
reply
brief.
we
just...
we
have
no
incentive.
the
incentive
structure
would
not
lead
us
to
do
that
and
we
don't
do
that.
this
case
is
controlled
by
the
principles
set
forth
in
chevron
v.
nrdc.
the
netting
regulations
deserve
substantial
deference
and
should
be
upheld
unless
they
are
arbitrary,
capricious
or
manifestly
contrary
to
the
statute.
respondents
contend,
as
they
must
to
prevail
in
this
case,
that
the
regulations
cannot
possibly
be
reconciled
with
the
payment
correction
provisions.
but,
in
fact,
the
very
opposite
is
true.
the
language
and
history
of
these
provisions
and
their
evolution
reveal
a
clear
congressional
intent
to
permit
the
aggregation
of
past
errors
rather
than
just
the
consideration
of
each
monthly
error
in
isolation
and
to
mandate
a
waiver
procedure
only
in
the
case
where
the
secretary
attempts
prospective
means
of
recovery...
that
is,
the
reduction
in
forthcoming
benefits
or
the
demand
for
a
refund.
in
challenging
the
netting
practice,
respondents
focus
on
the
waiver
of
recovery
provision,
which
places
limits
on
the
secretary's
authority
to
collect
overpayments.
the
title
ii
waiver
provision
provides
that
there
shall
be
no
adjustment
or
recovery
from
any
person
who
is
without
fault
where
such
adjustment
or
recovery
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
statute
or
would
be
against
equity
and
good
conscience.
in
a
nutshell,
respondents
claim
that
netting,
which
necessarily
entails
the
setting
off
of
overpayment
errors
in
some
past
months
against
underpayment
errors
in
other
past
months,
is
a
form
of
adjustment
or
recovery
within
the
meaning
of
the
waiver
provision.
therefore,
they
contend,
the
secretary
must
consider
waiver
before
netting,
and
the
secretary
must
decide
whether
to
waive
the
total
amount
of
overpayments
considered
separate
and
apart
from
any
underpayments
that
may
have
occurred
before
netting
them
together.
and,
under
this
court's
decision
in
califano
v.
yamasaki,
that
means
a
face-to-face
hearing.
but
the
statutory
language
and
history
reveal
that
the
terms
adjustment
and
recovery
were
never
intended
to
refer
to
retroactive
setoffs
but,
rather,
to
prospective
recruitment
methods.
that
is,
the
reduction
in
forthcoming
benefits
or
an
out-of-pocket
refund.
and
the
waiver
provisions
were
intended
to
provide
procedural
protections
in
just
the
cases
where
the
secretary
attempts
to
use
those
methods
to
retrieve
the
money
that's
mistakenly
paid
out.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
there
are
two
sources
of
authority
for
netting,
that
is,
setting
off
past
overpayments
and
underpayments.
the
first
is
what
we
call
the
determination
clause
or
the
determination
provision
of
the
payment
correction
provisions.
the
statute
says
that
whenever
the
secretary
determines
that
more
or
less
than
the
correct
amount
of
payment
has
been
made
or
benefits
have
been
paid,
then
under
regulations
prescribed
by
the
secretary,
he
shall
make
adjustment
or
recovery.
and
we
interpret
the
"authority"
to
determine
whether
more
or
less
than
the
correct
amount
of
payment
has
been
made
as
implicitly
delegating
to
the
secretary
the
prerogative
to
decide
over
what
past
period
he
shall
determine
whether
more
or
less
has
been
paid.
and
that
includes
the
authority
to
decide
whether
more
or
less
has
been
paid
up
to
the
point
when
he
makes
the
determination...
that
is,
over
the
entire
past
period.
second,
there
is
a
common-law
right
of
administrative
or
equitable
setoff
which
this
court
has
recognized
in
numerous
cases,
cases
that
are
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
including
gratiot
versus
united
states,
burchard
versus
united
states,
wisconsin
central
railroad,
and
a
long
line
of
cases
in
which
this
court
has
said
that
the
government
may
apply
assets
belonging
to
the
debtor
that
are
in
its
hands
against
debts
owed
to
the
government.
it
need
not
pay
out
those
amounts
and
then
attempt
to
get
them
back.
we
construe
that
as
a
sort
of
background
authority
to
do
a
setoff
in
any
type...
an
authority
that
needs
to
be--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
we
think
it
survives
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
as
this
court
has
noted
in
the
cases
i've
just
mentioned,
because
there
is
such
a
strong
presumption
that
the
government
can
do
common-law
setoff,
there
needs
to
be
a
very
explicit
congressional
expression
of
intent
to
limit
that
right
or
cut
it
off.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
we
think
that--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--when
those
terms
are
looked
at
in
their
statutory
context,
that
they
do
not
have
the
expansive
meaning...
that
is,
the
meaning
that
encompasses
retroactive
setoff...
they
have
a
narrower
meaning.
we
don't
think
that
those
terms
have
a
plain
meaning
and
we
think
that
if
we
look
at
the
1935
statute,
the
'39
statute,
the
way
that
these
provisions
have
evolved,
it
becomes
clear
that
congress
never
intended
those
terms
to
refer
to
retroactive
setoffs.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
the
secretary
is
allowed
to
look
backward
from...
not
from
the
time
that
the
underpayment
was
made,
but
from
the
time
when
he
determines--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--that
the
underpayment
is
made.
yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
let's
put
this
way--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--we
think
that
the
secretary
is
entitled
to
decide...
to
come
up
with
a
threshold
criterion
to
decide
when
the
equity
in
good
conscience
inquiry
should
take
place.
just
to
be
more
concrete
about
that,
if
an
individual
has
in
their
past
payment
record
an
underpayment
and
a
counterbalancing
overpayment,
they
are
in
a
very
different
position
from
someone
who
just
has
a
pure
overpayment
because
the
person
who
has
both
kinds
of
errors
can
always
satisfy
his
debt
to
the
government
by
extinguishing
the
government's
debt
to
him.
he
can
do
it
with
essentially
a
paper
transaction.
whereas,
the
person
who
has
a
pure
overpayment
cannot
do
it
with
a
paper
transaction.
he
has
to
either
risk
his
present
and
future
benefits,
suffer
a
garnishment
of
those
benefits,
or
he
has
to
reach
into
his
pocket
and
transfer
cash
to
the
government.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
as
a
general
matter
it's
more
likely
that
the
obligation
to
repay
a
net
overpayment
will
be
inequitable--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
this
court
has
said
in
cases
such
as
bowen
v.
yuckert
and
heckler
v.
campbell
that
even
where
a
statute
requires
an
individualized
determination
that
the
secretary
can
make
threshold
rules
which
weed
out
individuals
that
in
his
judgment
generally
will
not
meet
the
statutory
requirements.
and
the
secretary
has
a
lot
of
discretion
to
decide
when
recovery
would
be
inequitable.
those
are
broad
terms
that
the
secretary
necessarily
must
give
content
to.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
essentially
we
have
because
we
have
made
a
reasonable
distinction,
which
we
believe
is
reasonable,
between
individuals
who
have
mixed
errors
and
can
satisfy
their
debt
simply
by
erasing
two
numbers
on
two
sides
of
a
ledger
and
individuals
who
have
to
suffer
some
deprivation
in
the
present
to
pay
back
the
money.
we
think
that
that
is
the
sort
of
distinction
that
the
secretary
is
entitled
to
make
in
implementing
this
statute
and
in
giving
content
to
the
terms
"equity"
and
"good
conscience"
which
are
very
broad
general
terms
in
light
of
the
overall
purpose
of
the
statute.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
it's
both
in
a
way.
we
certainly
are
saying
that
the
statute
does
not
require
us
to
even
go
into
that
inquiry--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--until
netting
is
finished.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
but
in
order
to
lend
weight...
in
order
to
show
why
that's
reasonable,
given...
if
we
give
that
the
statute
maybe
isn't
entirely
clear--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
we're
really
arguing
in
the
alternative
here.
we're
saying
that
congress
was
quite
clear.
we
feel
that
congress
wrote
a
statute
that
was
very
clear
in
which
it
set
a
floor
that
we
only
need
to
consider
fault
equity
and
the
purposes
of
the
statute
after
we
finish
netting.
absolutely,
that's
our
position.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
that's
correct.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
our
position
is
that
such
a
retroactive
setoff
is
not
adjustment.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it
is
not
an
adjustment.
it's
not
recovery.
and
that
is
the...
those
are
the
meanings
that--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
a
person
who
faces
an
offset...
their
current
benefits,
the
amount
of
money
they
have
on
hand
today...
is
never
at
risk
because
they
can
satisfy
their
debt
to
the
government
by
extinguishing
the
government's
debt
to
them.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
your
honor,
as
you've
said,
we
don't
get
to
the
hardship
determination
until
we
finish
netting.
so,
that
partly
solves
the
problem.
but
in
terms
of
an
individual
who
has
been
underpaid
perhaps
getting
themselves
into
a
very
bad
situation
which
simple
reimbursement
of
the
amount
might
not
compensate
for...
if
a
person
has
a
pure
underpayment
error,
there
is
no
provision
in
the
statute
for
overcompensation
of
that
person.
that
person
may
go
into
debt,
they
may
incur
expenses
because
they
weren't
paid
timely
and
yet
the
statute
simply
provides
that
they
will
get
back
the
amount
that
they're
entitled
to...
not
that
they
will
be
deliberately
paid
more
than
they're
entitled
to,
which
is
what
would
happen
if
there
was
a
waiver
of
an
underpayment...
excuse
me...
an
overpayment
considered
separately.
so,
in
that
sense,
we
think
that
it's
fair
and
it
comports--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
sometimes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
it's
correct
that
that
is
the
hard
case,
justice
stevens.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
we
don't
think
it's
the
typical
case.
the
typical
case
is
really
more
like
the
cases
represented
by
the
named
plaintiffs
and
intervenors
who
had
their
underpayments
and
overpayments
bunched
up
and
sometimes
overlapping
in
a
fairly
contracted
period.
that
scenario
that
you
described
doesn't
come
up
all
that
often.
but
the
fact
remains
that
even
in
that
situation
the
person
has
gotten
the
money
they're
entitled
to
and,
when
they
have
to
repay
the
government,
they
can
do
it
by
applying
the
underpayment
to
their
overpayment;
they
don't
have
to
pay
out
of
pocket.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
justice
scalia
suggests,
why
not
just
go
ahead
and
net
and
then
give
the
person
the
opportunity
to
be
heard.
once
again,
we
don't
think
the
statute
requires
that.
but
also,
we
want
to
emphasize
that
that
would
place
a
significant
new
burden
on
the
agency
because
as
things
stand
now,
one-half
of
all
individuals
with
mixed
payment
errors
end
up
with
net
underpayments.
those
individuals'
accounts
can
be
resolved
very
promptly
just
by
sending
out
a
check.
and,
if
everyone
in
the
mixed
group
now
becomes
entitled
to
a
hearing,
that
will
swamp
the
system
with
multiple
new
hearing
obligations
that
will--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--essentially
double--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--it
would
be
very,
very
hard
for
a
person
to
prove
that
it
was
inequitable--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--for
them
to
keep
that--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--we
won't
lose
them
but
we'll
have
to
process
them.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
don't
know
that.
right
now
we
have--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
people
won't
request
waiver
with
the
same
frequency
in
that
population...
request
waiver
if
they're
separate
overpayments
in
the
same
frequency
as
they
now
request
waiver
of
their
net
overpayments.
we
have
no
way
of
knowing.
all
we
know
is
that
there
will
be
many,
many
more
requests
for
waiver,
the
vast
majority
of
which
will
virtually
be
non-meritorious,
thereby
delaying
our
processing
of
the
meritorious
net
overpayment
waiver
claims,
placing
a
significant
new
administrative
burden
on
the
agency.
and
that's
what
we're
worried
about.
that's
why
we're
here
today.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
initially,
they
are
conducted
before
a
program
officer.
they
are
an
informal
face-to-face
hearing
before
a
program
officer.
but,
of
course,
all
appeal
rights
are
reserved.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes.
there
can
be
appeal
to
the
administrative
law
judge,
to
the
appeals
council,
to
the
district
court.
the
resolution
of
mixed
errors
can
be
delayed
indefinitely
by
this
new
waiver
right.
that's
why
we're
very
concerned
about
it.
secondly,
it's
true
that
in
some
of
the
cases
of
the
named
plaintiffs
and
intervenors,
the
period
over
which
overpayments
and
underpayments
were
netted
was
fairly
extensive,
five
or
six
years.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
these
named
plaintiffs
conformed
to
justice
steven's
scenario.
ms.
wise
and
mr.
zwiezen
had
overpayments
and
underpayments
from
overlapping
periods.
they
actually
had
overpayments
and
underpayments
in
the
same
month.
it
would
be
preposterous,
we
submit,
to
waive
the
overpayment
component
and
othen
turn
around
and
pay
them
the
underpayment
component
when
they
have
both
errors
in
the
same
month.
for
example,
ms.
wise
was
overpaid
disability
benefits
because
she
was
working,
but
she
was
underpaid
retirement
benefits
that
she
was
entitled
to
but
did
not
collect.
justice
steven's
scenario
is
fairly
rare.
it's
a
very
remote
overpayment,
a
widely
separated
interval,
and
then
an
underpayment.
and
that
is
not
the
scenario
presented
by
any
of
the
individuals
who
are
named
in
this
case.
finally,
just
to
clarify,
it
is
the
secretary's
regulations
that
interpret
the
concepts
of
fault,
equity
and
good
conscience
and
defeat
the
purpose,
and
those
regulations
are
cited
in
respondent's
brief
at
note
4.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
we'll
conclude
our
remarks.
