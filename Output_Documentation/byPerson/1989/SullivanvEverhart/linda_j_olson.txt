ms.
linda
j.
olson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
an
analysis
of
the
waiver
statute,
42
u.s.c.
section
404(b),
and
the
manner
in
which
the
secretary's
netting
policy
abrogates
the
equitable
protections
provided
by
that
statute.
today
i
would
like
to
focus
on
these
three
main
issues:
the
plain
language
and
intent
of
the
waiver
statute,
the
fact
that
netting
is
a
form
of
adjustment
in
recovery
and
therefore
specifically
limited
by
the
waiver
statute,
and
the
fact
that
the
enforcement
of
the
lower
court's
order
would
not
be
unduly
burdensome.
the
waiver
statute
language
is
clear,
unambiguous
and
mandatory.
it
states
that
in
any
overpayment
case
there
shall
be
no
adjustment
or
recovery
from
any
blameless
person
if
such
recovery
would
cause
hardship
or
inequity.
this
broad
language
protects
any
overpaid
person.
it
does
not
exclude
overpaid
people
with
underpayments.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
yes.
i
am
interpreting
against...
that
would
violate
the--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--that's
right.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
or
would
defeat
the
purposes
of
the
act.
that
has
been
determined
to
mean
would
deprive
a
person
of
income
needed
for
ordinary
and
necessary
living
expenses.
and
that
would
be
the
hardship
aspect
of
waiver.
you
have
to
prove
both,
that
the
overpayment
was
not
your
fault
and
either
that
it
would
defeat
the
purposes
of
the
act
to
collect
it,
which
means
cause
a
financial
hardship,
or
that
it
would
be
inequitable
to
collect
it.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
no.
i'm
paraphrasing
that
it...
the
intent
of--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--violate
the
purpose
of
the
act.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
by...
by
this
court
and
by
the
legislature
in
its
legislative
history...
has
indicated
that
it
was
to
protect
people
from
any
sort
of
burdensome
collection
activity.
when
congress
enacted
the
waiver
provision
in
1939,
congress
was
aware
that
there
would
be
erroneous
payments
by
the
secretary
and
sought
to
protect,
in
limited
circumstances,
individuals
from
recovery
where
such
recovery
would
cause
great
financial
hardship.
there
is
no
evidence
that
congress
has
ever
sought
to
cut
back
on
this
broad
equitable
protection.
this
court
interprets
the--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--well,
the
ssi
regulations
of
the
title
xvi
regulation
has
been
in
effect
since
1975.
the
secretary's
brief
indicates
that
it
was
going
on
in
title
ii
sometime
before
then
but
we
really
don't
know.
the
only
clear
time
for
this
title
ii
regulation
is
in
1981
when
the
ruling
was
enacted.
the
yamasaki
case
of
1979
clearly
set
out
the
fact
that
congress
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
found
that
waiver
should
precede
any
sort
of
recovery,
a
waiver
consideration.
it
was
a
similar
attempt
by
the
secretary
to
infringe
on
a
beneficiary's
entitlement
to
seek
waiver
of
recovery.
and
this
court
found
that
recovery
could
not
precede
a
waiver
notice
and
hearing.
it's
that
very
notice
and
hearing
which
the
respondents'
are
seeking
prior
to
any
recovery
through
netting.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
the
court
did
not
specifically
address
netting,
although
there
is
some
indication
that
the
named
plaintiff
was
a
netting
victim.
but
yamasaki
is
applicable
in
that
it
did
deal
with
a
recovery
prior
to
the
institution
of
waiver
rights.
it
is
our
position
that
netting
is
a
recovery
and
the
plain
language
of
42
u.s.c.
section
404(a)
which
describes
the
collection
procedures
supports
our
position.
the
secretary
has
in
fact
conceded
that
if
netting
is
an
adjustment
or
recovery,
he
must
provide
waiver
rights.
404(a)
provides--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--well,
in
page
22
of
the
brief
in
chief
is
where
he
makes
that
concession.
the
plain
language
of
404(a)(1)
provides
whenever
the
secretary
finds
that
more
or
less
than
the
correct
amount
of
payment
has
been
made
to
any
person,
proper
adjustment
or
recovery
shall
be
made
under
regulations
prescribed.
again,
this
broad
language
is
used
which
says
whenever
the
secretary
finds
an
incorrect
payment
and,
furthermore,
the
words
"adjustment
and
recovery"
are
broad
terms
which
cover
a
variety
of
collection
attempts
which
we
would
argue
includes
the
netting
procedure.
the
adjective
"proper"
further
indicates
that
collection
only
from
individuals
not
eligible
for
waiver
is
allowed.
again,
this
court
in
the
yamasaki
decision,
indicated
that
the
implication
of
that
word
is
that
recoupment
from
persons
qualifying
for
waiver
would
not
be
proper.
and
it's
just
such
an
improper
recovery
we
contend
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
broad
connotations
of
the
words
adjustment
and
recovery
have
been
outlined
in
the
brief
and
certainly
should
be
interpreted
to
include
netting.
some
of
the
cases
cited
by--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--yes,
that
is
the
secretary's
position,
but
there
is
no...
there
is
no
definition
of
the
term
"more
or
less"
in
the
statute
that
would
support
such.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
not
where
the
secretary's
definition
directly
contradicts
the
succeeding
paragraph
which
just
says
that--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--well,
our
reading
of
more
or
less
would
mean
either
that
the
statute
is
supposed
to
be
distinguishing
between
overpayments,
which
would
be
more,
or
underpayments,
which
would
be
less.
and
that
differential
treatment
appears
throughout
this
statute
and
it
was
one
of
the
things
that
the
tenth
circuit
relied
on
in
striking
down
the
statute.
that
all
congress
intended
with
that
language
was
to
say
that
if
the
secretary
finds
that
more
than
the
correct
amount
of
payment
has
been
made,
look
to
waiver,
if
less
than
the
correct
amount
has
been
paid,
pay
the
underpayment.
another
way
of
looking
at
more
or
less
would
be
to
say
that
the
secretary
makes
a
monthly
determination
of
the
correct
amount
of
payment
and--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--well,
there
are
other
provisions
in
the
statute
which
refer
to
payments
being
made
monthly,
that
the
calculation
of
the
correct
amount
of
payment
is
determined
on
a
monthly
basis.
42
u.s.c.
402
and
423
both
indicate
that
title
ii
is
a
monthly
program,
and
42
u.s.c.
1382(c)(1)
also
highlights
the
fact
that
ssi
is
a
monthly
program.
the
reality
is
that
that's
how
the
secretary
conducts
business.
that's
how
the
secretary
does
netting,
is
to
first
find
out
what
the
correct
amount
of
payment
is
for
the
month.
after
that,
he
proceeds
to
the
second
step,
which
is
netting.
it's
incorrect
to
argue
that
netting
precedes
that
step
because
netting
can't
occur
until
first
a
monthly
determination
of
error
has
been
made
and
the
amounts
have
been
set
off.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
yes,
it
doesn't
say
payments
either,
though.
so--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--well,
we
would
again
say
that
it's
not
at
all
ambiguous
when
read
with...
in
the
material
with
subsection
b.
when
adjustment
and
recovery
appear
in
both
sections,
it
seems
clear
that
the
secretary
was
limited
specifically
in
any
type
of
adjustment
procedure.
the
secretary
himself,
in
his
own
regulations,
uses
the
words
adjustment
and
recovery
very
broadly
and
uses
them
to
refer
to
lump
sum
offsets.
those
are
adjustments.
increases
in
monthly
benefits
are
adjustments.
his
policy
operations
manual
even
describes
the
netting
procedure
as
an
adjustment.
there
is
a
great
deal
of
inconsistency
with
that
position
and
then
to
claim
that
it's
not
mandated
to
be
limited
under
the
waiver
statute.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
well,
the
regulation
itself
is
poorly
worded
at
best,
i
would
say.
i
think
that
if
the
regulation
were
left
intact
and
interpreted
to
mean
that
waiver
has
to
precede
netting,
that
the
respondents'
position
would
be--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--well,
we
are.
the
regulation
is
invalid
on
its
face,
it's
our
position.
but,
again,
the
regulation
itself
doesn't
clearly
say
that
you
can't
have
a
waiver
determination
before
netting,
although
that's
clearly--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--yes.
but
the
regulation
could
be...
could
be
amended
to
clarify,
as
416.543
does,
that
in
different
period
netting
situations,
the
secretary
does
provide
waiver
rights.
there
is
really
no
reason
why
there
should
be
this
distinction
between
different
period
and
same
period
netting,
and
we
would
submit
that
in
all
netting
situations
both
title
ii
and
title
xvi,
a
recipient
should
have
the
right
to
prove
hardship.
the
actual
effect
on
the
individual
of
the
netting
procedure
is
that
it
does
create
hardships
for
some
individuals
when
the
waiver
statute
is
designed
to
prevent
such
inequity.
there
is
no
question
that
when
the
secretary
netted
mr.
zweizen's
$4,000
underpayment
against
his
$9,000
overpayment
that
the
secretary
recovered
$4,000.
mr.
zweizen
has
$4,000
less
to
meet
his
obligations.
he
may
be
facing
foreclosure;
he
may
have
$10,000
in
medical
bills.
he
will
never
have
an
opportunity
to
prove
his
need
for
this
underpayment,
however,
under
the
secretary's
netting
system.
all
the
respondents
are
arguing
is
that
mr.
zweizen
should
have
that
opportunity
to
prove
why
such
recovery
is
inequitable.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
he,
the
secretary,
discovers
that
last
month
there
was
an
overpayment?
ms.
linda
j.
olson
well,
then...
then
he
notifies
the
client,
the
beneficiary,
that
there
has
been
an
overpayment,
asks
the
beneficiary
if
he
wishes
to
request
waiver
or
reconsideration
of
the
overpayment.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
that's
right.
that's
our
position.
not
in
the
absence
of...
of
the
waiver
opportunity.
although
the
secretary
would
argue
that
it's
a
rare
occurrence
that
there
are
long
netting
periods,
the
facts
of
the
named
plaintiffs
and
some
of
the
individuals
named
in
the
amicus
brief
belie
that
contention.
in
fact,
two
of
the
named
plaintiffs
had
seven-year
netting
periods.
mr.
zenick
had
a
five-year
netting
period.
certainly
if
there
is
a
very
short
netting
period,
if,
as
justice
white
indicated,
there's
a
few
months
involved,
it's
less
likely
that
one
could
establish
the
inequitability
of
returning
the
money.
it's
more
likely
that
the
overpayment
is
around
or
that
the
overpayment
amount
is
relatively
small.
but
in
lengthy
netting
periods,
it's
clear
that
the
overpayment
has
long
since
been
spent.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
no.
the
secretary
really
has
no
statistics
as
to
how
the
netting
policy
works,
how
many
people
are
affected
by
it
precisely.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
well,
i
think
that
the
language
of
the
statute
lends
itself
to
the
presumption
that
you
can
go
back
many
years.
as
judge
gibbons
found
in
the
lugo
dissent,
you
could
go...
the
secretary
could
go
back
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
collect
overpayments
through
netting.
there's
no...
there's
no
limitation
on
the
regulation
to
prevent
such
a
presumption.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
well,
there's
no
reason
to
believe,
i
think,
that
it
is
a
rare
situation.
in
our
experience,
we
have
seen
many
individuals
come
in
with
long
periods
such
as
this.
the
reality
is,
when
the
secretary
terminates
someone's
benefits,
the
secretary
knows
that
person
has
been
overpaid.
a
notice
could
go
out
that
day,
the
same
day
as
the
termination
notice.
but,
for
some
reason,
in
situations
such
as
mr.
zenick,
no
overpayment
notice
goes
out
until
years
later
when
he's
due
a
large
underpayment.
there
is
no
disincentive
for
such
a
lengthy
netting
period
at
this
point,
and
that's
one
of
our
concerns.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
no.
we're
not
attributing
a
bad
motive
to
the
secretary.
it
is
a
huge
system
and
people
do--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--get
lost.
but
if
someone
is
a
relatively
poor
individual
who
loses
his
benefits,
the
secretary
doesn't
have
many
recourses
to
collect
that
money.
he
can
sue
him,
but
that
is
very
rarely
done.
the
easiest,
most
efficient
way
to
get--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--the
money
back
is
to
offset.
when
the
secretary
has
the--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--yes.
[laughter]
ms.
linda
j.
olson
the
secretary's...
the
secretary's
position
shows
that
we
would
argue
as
a
patent
disregard
for
some
of
the
desperate
financial
straits
in
which
some
disabled
and
elderly
people
find
themselves.
by
presuming
that
an
individual
who
is
owed
an
underpayment
has
no
need
for
his
funds
if
he
also
has
an
overpayment,
the
secretary
does
a
great
disservice
to
many
individuals
who
do
have
obligations
to
meet.
if
they
have
a
large
medical
bill
and
the
secretary
has
netted
their
overpayment
so
that
they
cannot
pay
it
with
their
underpayment,
individuals
will
reduce
their
monthly
income
to
make
those
payments.
so,
contrary
to
the
secretary's
representations,
there
will
be
a
reduction
in
one's
standard
of
living.
there
will
be
economic
insecurity
because
those
debts
which
could
have
been
paid
with
the
underpayment
will
now
be
paid
with
their
limited
monthly
income.
congress
did
not
intend
such
a
result
when
it
enacted
the
404(a)
and
404(b).
the
lugo
court,
which
contradicts
the
tenth
circuit's
decision,
made
a
number
of
misassumptions.
it
indicated
that
it
was
somewhat
troubled
by
the
scenario
of
an
individual
like
mr.
lugo
who
had
a
large
netting
period,
but
presumed
that
it
didn't
affect
a
lot
of
people.
there
was
no
data
cited
for
why
it
made
this
presumption.
the
lugo
majority
wrongly
considered
waivers
to
be
windfalls
when
in
fact
the
waiver
protection
is
specifically
designed
to
protect
the
most
needy
and
the
most
vulnerable.
it
is
not
a
windfall.
it
misapplied
the
yamasaki
decision.
yamasaki
made
a
limited
exception
in
the
case
of
reconsideration
decisions.
if
someone
is
just
disputing
the
amount
of
an
overpayment,
they
do
not
need
to
have
a
prerecoupment
notice
and
hearing.
that
is
not
the
case
in
the
netting
situation.
what
is
at
issue
in
netting
is
the
waiver
protection.
furthermore,
the
lugo
majority
improperly
relied
on
the
secretary's
claim
that
if
netting
is
eliminated,
a
multitude
of
confusing
notices
and
monthly
hearings
would
be
required.
the
tenth
circuit
properly
held
that
it
would
not
be
administratively
burdensome
to
eliminate
the
existing
netting
policy.
the
tenth
circuit
found
the
secretary
would
be
under
no
greater
burden
to
provide
notice
in
hearings
than
already
imposed
under
the
statue
in
yamasaki.
there
is
no
requirement
of
monthly
notices
or
monthly
hearings.
many
of
the
provisions
that
the
tenth
circuit
would
require
are
already
in
place.
the
secretary
has
a
regulation,
20
c.f.r.
416.558,
which
provides
for
notices
which
break
down
the
overpayment
and
underpayment
for
each
month.
that
is
all
that
we
would
need
as
well
as
a
pre-netting
waiver
procedure
which
is
found
at
20
c.f.r.
416.543.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
i
think
that
would
still
contradict
the
act.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
because
it's
a
recoupment.
netting
is
a
recoupment,
and
no
recoupment
can
proceed
until
a
netting
determination
is--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--well,
that--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--well,
this
court
found
that
recovery
shouldn't
be
exalted
over
waiver
protections,
and
that
would
be
such
an
exaltation.
the
essence
of
an
equitable
statute
such
as
the
waiver
statute
is
the
individual
determination,
the
individual
opportunity
to
prove
hardship.
by
netting
first;
you're
taking
away
that
individual's
opportunity
and--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--because
the
statute
and
congress
didn't
intend
it
to
work
that
way.
when
it
said
there
shall
be
no
recovery
from
blameless
people,
it
meant
there
shall
be
no
recovery
through
netting
or
any
other
sort
of
adjustment,
and
this
is
just
that
sort
of
recovery.
the
secretary
acknowledges
that
only
six
percent
of
overpaid
people
ever
even
request
waiver.
so,
we're
not
talking
about
a
system
that
would
deluge
the
secretary
with
waiver
requests.
half
of
the
people
that
apply
frequently
are
granted
waiver,
and
those
would
be
the
most
needy.
the
12,000--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--yes.
the
beneficiary
has
to
fill
out
an
overpayment
questionnaire,
a
waiver
questionnaire,
which
is
about
six
pages,
setting
forth
why
he
was
not
at
fault
in
causing
the
overpayment,
and
listing
his
financial
circumstances
and
why
recovery
would
be
inequitable.
he
would
have
an
opportunity
to
present
testimony
about
that,
his
credibility
could
be
assessed
in
the
way
the
statute
intended
then
before
collection
could
take
place.
it's
possible
to
get
a
partial
waiver.
it's
possible
that
one
could
go
through
that
hearing
and
the
administrative
law
judge
could
determine
you're
entitled
to
waiver
of
the
balance
of
the
overpayment
but
for
the
amount
that
would
be
covered
by
the
underpayment,
the
secretary
can
keep
it.
there
are
a
number
of
possible
scenarios--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--that's
right.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
well,
we
don't
necessarily
say
that
the
underpayment
would
have
to
be
paid
first.
that
is
a
possibility
and
that--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--i'm--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--the
regulations
indicate
that
the
secretary
should
promptly
send
out
underpayments.
the
statute
404(a)
requires
the
secretary
to
remit
underpayments--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--when
they're
determined.
the
promptness
as
to
how
fast
the
underpayment
has
to
be
sent
out,
though,
is
not
specified
in
the
regulation.
we
would
certainly
argue
that
the
underpayment
can't
be
held,
and
in
fact
the
existing
netting
regulations--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--yes.
so
long
as--
ms.
linda
j.
olson
--well,
yes.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
within
a
reasonable
time.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
yes.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
yes.
and,
in
fact,
in
our
brief
we
did
propose
that
procedure.
i'm
sorry
if
i
misunderstood
you.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
yeah.
i
must
have
misunderstood.
i
was
thinking
if
it
was
months.
i
mean,
if
we
were
talking
of
six
or
ten
months
of
holding
an...
recovering
an
underpayment
that
way,
that
wouldn't
be
proper.
but
there
is
not
a
requirement
that
would
immediately
demand
reimbursement
of
the
underpayments
if
the
overpayment
were
determined
at
the
same
time.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
well,
we
certainly
don't
want
to
aggravate
the
hardship
or
the
inequity
by
a
system
that
would
demand
that
an
underpayment
be
withheld
for
a
great
length
of
time.
the
problem
now
is
the
secretary
fails
to
make
prompt
waiver
determinations.
some
of
the
people
in
the
amicus
brief
have
waited
years
for
a
waiver
determination.
so,
that
would
not
be
a
good
resolution
to
the
problem.
but
a
prompt
waiver
determination
could...
could
resolve
our
concerns.
ms.
linda
j.
olson
that's
right.
that's
the
secretary's
position.
you
only
get
to
waiver
if
you
have
a
net
overpayment.
but
everything
in
the
statute,
as
we
read
it
and
as
congress
intended,
contradicts
that
presumption.
as
the
tenth
circuit
held,
the
fundamental
flaw
in
the
secretary's
reasoning
is
that
through
netting
he
is
effectively
recovering
benefits
and
such
recovery,
in
the
absence
of
a
waiver
determination,
violates
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
yamasaki.
we
respectfully
request
this
court
to
affirm
the
tenth
circuit's
decision.
thank
you.
