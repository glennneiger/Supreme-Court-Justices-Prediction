justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
that
court
held
invalid
certain
regulations
promulgated
by
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services,
under
which
he
nets
or
calculates
the
difference
between
past
underpayments
and
past
overpayments.
the
essence
of
the
dispute
is
that
the
social
security
act
requires
the
secretary
to
provide
a
hearing
to
see
whether
it
is
equitable
or
not
before
he
seeks
to
recover
past
overpayments.
and
the
dispute
is
whether
that
must
be
done
on
a
month
by
month
basis,
a
payment
by
payment
basis,
or
rather
the
secretary
may
offset
prior
overpayments
against
prior
underpayments
and
therefore
not
have
to
in
effect
provide
the
hearing
before
collecting
through
offset
the
prior
overpayments.
the
text
of
the
social
security
act
at
issue
requires
the
secretary
to
find
whether
“more
or
less
than
the
correct
amount
of
payment
of
benefits”
has
been
paid.
what
the
issue
comes
down
to
is
whether
the
term
"correct
amount"
can
reasonably
be
construed
as
the
secretary
has
construed
to
refer
to
the
net
amount
owing
as
of
the
date
of
his
determination
rather
than
the
amount
owing
each
month.
for
the
reason
set
forth
in
the
opinion
and
too
tedious
to
repeat
here,
we
hold
that
he
can.
we
also
hold
that
the
secretary’s
method
of
computing
the
netting
period
does
not
make
the
regulations
arbitrary
and
capricious.
some
delay
is
inevitable
to
avoid
errors
and
the
secretary’s
regulations
limit
delay.
the
respondent’s
alternative
suggestion
would
either
increase
the
administrative
burden
or
fail
to
remedy
alleged
delay
problem.
therefore,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
is
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
our
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan,
marshall,
and
kennedy
have
joined.
