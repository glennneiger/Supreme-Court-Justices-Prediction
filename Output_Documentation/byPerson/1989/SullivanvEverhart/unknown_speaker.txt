unknown
speaker
ms.
wax,
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
says
that
once
the
secretary
detects
an
overpayment
that
it
sometimes
holds...
the
government
sometimes
holds
the
netting
period
open
and
purposely
underpays
the
recipient
until
it
can
net
out
the
overpayment
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
this
netting
regulation.
do
you
know
of
any
instances
in
which
that
may
have
occurred?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
regulations
if
the
secretary
were
to
do
what
amicus
says
is
done
sometimes?
unknown
speaker
but
there
is
no
regulation
requiring
prompt
action.
what
recourse
would
a
recipient
have
faced
with
this
sort
of
problem?
unknown
speaker
ms.
wax,
i
assume
that
tardiness,
that
just
waiting,
is
not
a
very
intelligent
policy
for
the
secretary.
i
mean,
he
can't
use
it
intentionally
to
do
harm
unless
he's
sure
that
there
will
be
a
future...
a
future
underpayment.
and
presumably
it
does
violate
a
regulation
intentionally
to
make
an
underpayment.
or,
doesn't
it?
indeed,
it
violates
the
statute,
does
it
not?
unknown
speaker
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
secretary
cannot
consciously
and
maliciously
use
delay
because
he
doesn't
know
whether
he's
going
to
make
a
future
underpayment
or
not.
or,
does
he?
unknown
speaker
to
do
what?
unknown
speaker
regardless
of
whether
it
would
be
arbitrary.
i'm
saying
whether
it's
arbitrary
or
not,
it's
not
very
intelligent--
unknown
speaker
--because
the
secretary
doesn't
know
that
he's
going
to
make
a
future
underpayment
and
he's
just
sitting
around
failing
to
collect
the
overpayment
on
the
speculation
that
there
will
be
a
future
underpayment,
unless
you
assume
that
he
can
consciously
make
a
future
underpayment
in
order
to
work
the
system.
he
can't
do
that,
can
he?
well,
of
course,
that's...
that's
exactly
the
allegation
that's
made
by
amicus.
precisely
that.
well,
then
your
answer
to
that
is
that
there
is
a
law
against
his
making
future
underpayments.
is
there
not
or
is
there
not?
unknown
speaker
he
violates
the
law
if
he
does
it
negligently.
he
has
to
make
up
the
underpayment.
he's
violated
the
statute.
he
owes
somebody
something.
unknown
speaker
if
"adjustment"
and
"recovery"
in
the
statute
don't
include
netting,
then
where
does
the
secretary
get
his
authority
for
the
netting
regulation?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but...
may
i
just
interrupt
you.
do
you
think
that
common-law
authority
survives
the
statutory
provision
that
no
adjustment
shall
be
made
without
providing
for
the...
you
know,
of
an
overpayment
unless
you
have
the
opportunity
to
forgive
part
of
it?
how
does
the
common-law
survive
that
statutory
enactment?
unknown
speaker
what
could
be
more
explicit
than
no
adjustment
shall
be
made
if
it
would
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
subchapter
and
so
forth?
unknown
speaker
that's
pretty
explicit.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
just
ask
then,
is
it
your
position
that
at
the
time
an
underpayment
is
made
and
it's
identified,
the
government
can
always
look
back
as
far
as
it
can
to
see
whether
there
is
any
past
overpayment
and
always
set
it
off
regardless
of
whether
equity
or
good
conscience
would
justify
it?
they
could
do
it
deliberately
in
every
case.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
right,
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
and
to
follow-up
on
justice
steven's
question,
in
your
view,
that
would
never
result
in
a
recoupment
that
was
against
equity
or
good
conscience?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
we
put
it
my
way?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
again,
i
think
the
respondent
is
correct
in
saying
that
you
basically
have
a
per
se
rule
that
netting
can
never
result
in
a
recoupment
that's
against
equity
or
good
conscience.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
whole
scheme
of
the
statute
is
that
we
don't
look
at
it
as
a
general
matter.
we
look
at
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
unknown
speaker
but
you've
given
content
to
them
in
this
case
by
a
per
se
rule
that
there
can
never
be
a
recoupment
that's
against
equity
or
good
conscience
whenever
there
is
netting.
isn't
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
the
government's
position.
i
thought
the
government
was
saying
that
it
is
only
required
to
consider
equity
and
good
conscience
by
the
statute
after
the
netting.
now
you
are
saying...
which
seems
to
me
quite
different
and
a
proposition
i
find
quite
difficult
to
grasp...
that
that's
not
it.
but,
rather,
what
the
government
says
is
that
there
is
no
violation
of
equity
and
good
conscience
so
long
as
you're
netting.
in
other
words,
the
statutory
provision
governs
but
you
are
just
adopting
a
general
rule
that
will
comply
with
the
statutory
provision.
now,
which
is
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
so--
unknown
speaker
--that's
what
i
understood
you
to--
unknown
speaker
--statutes
don't
have
to
be
reasonable.
i
mean,
if
that's
what
you
think
congress
was
driving
at...
if
you
think
congress
made
the
determination
we're
only
worried
about
people
who
have
to
cough
up
money
or
who
have
to
make
a
reduction
of
future
payments,
it
seems
to
me
that's
all
you'd
have
to
worry
about.
do
you
have
to
prove
that
that
is
reasonable
as
well?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying,
in
other
words,
is
that
even
if
it's
clear
to
everyone
who
is
interested
in
the
problem
that
it
would
be
against
equity
and
good
conscience
not
to
allow
the
recoupment...
but
not
to
allow
the
person
to
keep
the
overpayment...
nevertheless,
it's
not
an
adjustment
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
so
we
don't
care
about
equity
and
good
conscience
with
what
may
have
happened
prior
to
the
time
you
decided
whether
or
not
to
adjust.
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
it
is
not
an
adjustment?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
perfectly
fair
because
you're
sure
that
the
recipient
of
the
allowance
has
plenty
of
money
to
offset?
there
are
never
cases
in
which
the
person
is
at
a
minimum
subsistence
level
and
there
really
is
a
hardship
working
out
of
this?
unknown
speaker
have
you
ever
heard
of
credit?
i
mean,
some
of
these
people
may
have
committed,
you
know,
future
outlays
in
anticipation
that
they're
going
to
have
more
money
coming
in
in
the
future.
i
think
it's
a
very
hard
burden
to
bear
if
the
secretary
is
trying
to
persuade
us
that
this
will
never
result
in
a
situation
that's
going
to
impose
something
of
a
hardship
on
the
person
who
has
to
have
the
setoff.
unknown
speaker
but
except
that
the
overpayment
by
hypothesis
will
have
occurred
sometime
in
the
past.
i
mean,
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
whenever
the...
whenever
the
recipient
is
objecting
to
not
getting
enough
today
and
the
answer
is,
well,
you
were
overpaid
three
years
ago,
there
always...
what
happened
is
something
that's
long
in
the
past
for
people
who
normally
don't
save
that
money
for
long
periods
of
time.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
that
the
typical
case?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
wax.
ms.
olson,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
does
it
use
the
word
hardship
or
are
you
saying
against
equity
and
good
conscience?
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
we're
talking
about
the
clear
language
of
the
statute
as
against
equity
and
good
conscience?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
is
the
term
"hardship"
used
in
one
of
the
regulations?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
it
has
been
interpreted
to
mean,
you
mean
by
the
agency?
unknown
speaker
how
long
has
the
netting
been
going
on?
unknown
speaker
was
the
court
in
yamasaki
dealing
with
this
situation
where
you're
talking
about
a
setoff
of
previously
received
benefits?
unknown
speaker
where
has
he
conceded
that?
because
i
interpreted
the
argument
this
morning
to
contradict
that.
there
was
an
alternative
argument
made.
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
olson,
i
guess
the
government
takes
the
position
that
the
statutory
language
that
directs
the
secretary
to
find
whether
more
or
less
than
the
correct
amount
of
payment
was
made
is
sufficiently
general
that
it
permits
the
secretary
to
determine
whether
there
has
been
a
net
overpayment
or
a
net
underpayment.
so,
you
don't
get
to
the
question
of
adjustment
or
recovery
until
that
step
has
been
taken.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
then
that
some
deference
to
the
secretary's
definition
is
owing?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't
contradict
it
if...
if
their
reasoning
is
correct
on
their
definition
of
determining
whether
more
or
less
than
the
correct
amount
has
been
paid.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
it
has
to
be
done
monthly,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
congress
could
have
made
that
very...
i
mean,
if
congress
had
that
very
clearly
in
mind,
it
could
have
just
inserted
the
indefinite
article
a.
i
mean,
it
could
have...
whenever
the
secretary
finds
that
more
or
less
than
the
correct
amount
of
a
payment
has
been
made
to
any
person.
and
that's
essentially
what
you
are
arguing,
that
payment
must
be
read
to
mean
a
payment.
it
didn't
really
say
a
payment,
though.
it
just
says
more
or
less
than
the
correct
amount
of
payment.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't
say
payments
either.
that's
fair.
so
the
government
would
say,
well,
that
means
it's
ambiguous
and
the
tie
goes
to
the
secretary.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it's
clear
that
if
the
regulation
is
valid,
what
he's
done
in
this
case
is
valid.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
know
you
were
arguing
for
a
different
interpretation
of
the
regulation.
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
this
is
invalid.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose,
though,
you
would
at
least
say
that
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
his
own
regulation
is
entitled
to
some--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
would
say
that...
you
would
say
that
the
secretary
isn't
entitled.
suppose
he
is
about
to
make
a
monthly
payment
and
he
then
discovers
that
last
month's
payment
was
an
overpayment...
what
can
he
do
about
that?
anything?
unknown
speaker
yes.
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
then
if
there's
been...
and
if
he
discovers
that
there's
been
an
underpayment
the
month
before
and
an
overpayment
in
the
month
before
that,
you
think
he
can't
net?
unknown
speaker
but
do
we
have
any
statistics
as
to
the
operation
of
the
netting
provision,
as
to
whether
most
of
the
payments
cover
and
the
setoffs
cover
a
long
period
of
time
or
a
short
period
of
time?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
do
you
think
a
facial'
attack,
such
as
you've
made,
is
justified?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
might
not
the
proper
relief
there
be
to
something
more
determinative
to
that
particular
situation
rather
than
just
striking
down
a
regulation
which
might
only
rarely
reach
that
situation?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
there
any
disincentive?
every
year
the
secretary
is
waiting...
this
fellow
is
using
the
secretary's
money.
and
the
secretary
isn't
sure
that
there's
going
to
be
an
underpayment.
he
doesn't
go
out
to
make
underpayments
in
the
future,
does
he?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see
what
you're
saying.
unknown
speaker
you
may
be
right.
the
chances
that
there
will
be
a
mistake
in
the
future,
including
an
underpayment,
are
probably
pretty
good.
unknown
speaker
you
may
be
right.
unknown
speaker
a
pre-netting
waiver?
why?
why
would
you
allow
netting
but
allow
the
hardship
determination
to
be
made
after
the
netting?
unknown
speaker
why?
why
would
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
right,
but
he
nets
and
he
says,
i
acknowledge...
let's
see...
he
changes
positions...
says,
i
acknowledge
that
netting
is
a
recoupment.
all
the
statute
requires
then,
is
that
before
i
make
netting,
i
have
to
have
a
hearing
to
see
whether
given
the
fact
that
i'm
only
setting
off
you
really
have
any
hardship.
why
can't
he
do
that?
given
the
fact
that
i'm
only
setting
off,
there
is
no
hardship.
and
the
secretary
says,
you
know,
99
times
out
of
100
there
won't
be
any.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
have
to
insist
that
it
be
done
monthly?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
am
allowing
him
to
prove
hardship.
the
secretary
conducts
the
netting
just
the
way
he
does
now,
only
he
allows
the
individual
to
come
in
and
say
even
though
you're
setting
off
and
even
though
i
don't
have
to
reach
in
my
pocket,
there
is
still
hardship
in
my
particular
case.
why
wouldn't
that
satisfy
all
of
your
objections?
unknown
speaker
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
in
these
kinds
of
hearings?
does
the
beneficiary
have
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
hearing
to
show
that
there
would
be
hardship?
unknown
speaker
you
say
keep
it.
actually,
the
secretary
would
be
able
to
recover
it
because--
unknown
speaker
--under
your...
it
would
be
paid
first,
then
there
would
be
the
hearing
and
the
alj
might
say,
well,
now
you've
got
to
give
that
underpayment
back.
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
that's
what
justice
scalia
was
suggesting.
i
thought
you
were
saying
it
had
to
be.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
overpayment
has
to...
isn't
it
correct
under
your
view
that
the
overpayment
has
to
be
paid
right
away
together
with
a
notice
that
you
have
a
right
to
take
the
benefit
of
the
good
faith
exception?
but
don't
you
have
to
get
the...
isn't
it
true
that
they
have
to
turn
over
the
money
right
away?
as
soon
as
the
government...
as
soon
as
the
secretary
finds
there's
been
an
underpayment,
is
it
not
your
view
that
the
secretary
has
a
duty
to
pay
the
amount
of
the
underpayment
together
with
a
notice
that
we
have
a
right
to
collect
it
back
because
of
prior
overpayments?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
it
be
held
for
the
period
of
time
required
for
the
secretary
to
send
a
notice
saying
there
was
an
earlier
overpayment
and
you
have
a
right
to
have
it
offset
under
paragraph
b?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would
say
that
the
secretary
could
hold
the
money
during
the
time
period
required
to
resolve
the
section
b
dispute?
unknown
speaker
or
at
least
to
see
whether
they
raise
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
now,
if
they
sent
out
a
notice
and
said,
okay,
within
30
days
you
have
to
claim
a
right
to
a
setoff...
the
right
to
keep
the
overpayment.
if
you
don't
do
so,
we're
just
going
to
offset
it.
unknown
speaker
they
could
do
that?
unknown
speaker
because
i
thought
you
answered
the
other
way
to
justice
scalia.
unknown
speaker
why
not
ten
months?
i
don't
understand.
once
you
accept
that,
it
seems
to
me
you
say
that
the
secretary
can
use
this
netting
procedure
so
long
as
he
gives
you
a
hearing
or
some
kind
of
a
process
to
determine
that
the
offset
isn't
going
to
impose
hardship.
that's
really
all
you're
asking
for,
but
you're
insisting
that
it
be
done
promptly.
unknown
speaker
the
secretary
takes
the
position,
as
i
understand
it,
that
you
never
get
to
the
waiver
problem.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
olson.
ms.
wax,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
no,
except
for
this--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
just
interrupt?
except
for
this.
that
in
each
of
those
cases
the
person
had
the
burden
of
proving
that
it
would
be
inequitable
even
if
the
person
kept
the
amount
in
dispute.
as
you
said
earlier,
most
of
the
time
it's
going
to
work
out
fairly
if
they
keep
the
amount
in
dispute.
so,
the
burden
is
really
higher
for
a
person
who
has
that
cash
on
the
table
and,
say,
the
government
can't
keep
that
cash.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
won't
lose
many
of
those
cases
then.
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
they
probably
wouldn't
bring
most
of
them,
would
they?
unknown
speaker
but
your
argument
earlier
about
why
this
was
basically
fair,
we
really
assume
that
to
be
the
case
in
the
typical
case.
unknown
speaker
do
the
waiver
applications
or
hearings...
are
they
conducted
before
an
administrative
law
judge?
unknown
speaker
so,
either...
a
party
that
is
dissatisfied
with
the
determination
of
the
program
officer
can
appeal
to
an
administrative
law
judge?
