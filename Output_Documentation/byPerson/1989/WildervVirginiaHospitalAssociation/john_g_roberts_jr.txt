mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
may
be
helpful
at
this
point
to
return
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
that
language
specifies
that
a
state
medicaid
plan
must
provide
for
the
payment
of
rates
which
the
state
finds,
and
makes
assurances
satisfactory
to
the
secretary,
are
reasonable
and
adequate
to
meet
the
costs
that
an
efficiently
and
economically
operated
facility
must
incur
to
provide
care
and
services
and
to
assure
that
eligible
individuals
have
reasonable
access
to
services
of
adequate
quality.
in
providing
for
state
findings
and
assurances,
this
language
vests
responsibility
for
rate
setting
squarely
on
the
shoulders
of
the
states.
it
does
not
secure
any
substantive
federal
right
to
the
payment
of
particular
rates.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
there
may
well
have
been,
your
honor.
certainly
several
lower
federal
courts
found
that
there
was.
but
the
important
distinction
is...
there
are
two
major
respects
in
which
the
language
prior
to
1980
was
very
different.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
different
than
in
the
implied
right-of-action
cases.
i
don't
think
it's,
for
example,
like
the
merrill
lynch
case,
where
if
congress...
congress
did
not
provide
a
judicial
right
of
action
even
prior
to
1980.
the
question
is
whether
the
language
it
used
secured
a
right
which
then
could
be
enforced
under
1983.
so
i
don't
think
you
should
look
for
particular
evidence
that
they
were
withdrawing
a
judicial
remedy.
you
simply
construe
the
language
of
the
statute
to
see
if
it
secures
a
right,
and
in
this
case,
looking
first
at
the
standard
for
payment,
that
standard
is
not
the
sort
of
language
that
suggests
congress
intended
there
to
be
judicial
policing
of
rates.
how
do
we
tell--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
statute
requires
that
the
state
plan
have
a
provision
for
payment
of
rates.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
may
well
be,
if
the
allegation
in
the
complaint
is
that
the
state
plan...
the
state
has
not
made
findings
that
its
rates
meet
this
standard,
or
that
the
state
has
not
given
assurances
to
the
secretary
at
all.
but
that's
not
the
relief
that
these
plaintiffs
seek.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
not,
your
honor.
it
is
only...
the
only
thing
that
the
act
requires
is
state
findings
and
state
assurances.
there's
no
basis
for
a
court
to
look
behind
those
findings
and
assurances.
this
is
not
the
pre-1980
situation,
where
the
statute
said
the
plan
must
provide
for
payment
of
rates
at
this
level.
the
only
requirements
are
that
the
state
find
that
its
rates
meet
this
level
and
assure
the
secretary.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
you
should
sue
the
secretary.
i
think
the
statutory
standard,
assurances
satisfactory
to
the
secretary,
is
one
that
does
not
give
law
to
apply
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
think
that's
an
absurd
conclusion.
the
notion...
it
is
not
the
case
that
enactments
of
congress
that
confer
certain
protections
are
meaningless
unless
they
can
be
enforced
in
court.
it
is
a
meaningful
and
significant
protection
to
providers,
perhaps,
in
this
statute,
that
the
state
officials
are
required
to
stand
up
and
say,
we
find
that
our
rates
meet
this
standard.
it
is
an
additional
meaningful
and
significant
protection
that
they
must
assure
the
secretary
that
that
is
the
case.
but
the
providers
want
more.
they
want,
as
you
suggest,
to
be
able
to
haul
the
officials
into
federal
court
and
say,
prove
it,
or
say,
under
any
other
standard
that's
arbitrary
and
capricious,
we
don't
think
that
your
findings
are
right.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
in
the
first
place,
of
course,
that
question
is
not
presented
here,
but
in
the
second
place,
the
statutory
standard,
assurances
satisfactory
to
the
secretary,
is
one
that
by
its
very
terms
commits
that
decision
to
agency
discretion.
i
don't
think
there
are
any
standards
for
a
district
court
or
a
court
of
appeals--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--my
point
is
that
they
do
get
something,
and
they
get
it
in
two
different
places.
they
get
it
with
the
responsible
state
officials
who
have
to
make
the
findings,
they
get
it
with
the
secretary
who
has
to
review
the
assurances.
they
want
a
third
option.
they
want
to
get
it
in
court.
but
congress,
in
using
the
language
in
the
boren
amendment,
did
not
secure
to
them
any
rights
enforceable
in
court.
the
language
of
the
standard
itself,
quite
apart
from
the
findings
and
assurances
language,
is
not
the
sort
that
suggests
the
securing
of
rights:
reasonable
and
adequate,
efficient
and
economical.
what
are
the
costs
that
must
be
incurred,
as
opposed
to
simply
those
that
are
incurred?
these
are
not
objective
facts
that
can
be
found
by
a
court.
they
are
policy
judgments,
policy
judgments
that
congress,
in
providing
for
state
findings
and
assurances,
clearly
vested
with
the
state.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
even
if
you
get
over
that
hurdle,
your
honor,
the
only
requirement...
that's...
that
goes
to
the
standard
against
which
the
state
must
make
its
findings
and
assurances,
but
the
only
mandate
in
the
statute
is
that
findings
be
made,
assurances
be
given
and
the
secretary's
approval
obtained.
that
is,
of
course,
very
different
from
the
situation
prior
to
1980,
when
these
lower
case...
court
cases
were
decided,
when
the
repeal
of
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
and
the
repeal
of
the
repealer
took
place.
perhaps
there
was
a
right
of
action
at
that
time,
but
the
one
thing
that's
clear
is
that
congress
made
a
significant
change
at
that
time.
it
not
only
changed
the
standard
from
reasonable
cost,
but
it
also
inserted
the
language
of
findings
and
assurances.
it
left
the
responsibility
for
rate-setting
with
the
states
and
not
to
be
second-guessed
in
federal
court.
it
is
telling,
i
think,
that
there
is
no
explanation
in
the
plaintiffs'
submission
to
this
court,
or
of
that
of
their
amici,
as
to
what
they
thought
congress
was
trying
to
do
when
they
made
this
change,
when
they
inserted
the
requirement
of
findings
and
assurances.
and
it
seemed...
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
with
respect
to
the
secretary
is
that
they
wanted
the
secretary
to
back
off.
his
review
was
not
to
look
at
the
rates,
but
to
assure
proper
accountability,
to
make
sure
that
the
findings
were
made,
and
it
seems
curious
to
suggest
at
the
same
time
that
congress
was
pulling
the
secretary
back,
it
nonetheless
intended
that
every
provider
have
a
right
to
challenge
the
level
of
its
rates
in
federal
court
before
a
federal
judge.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
it's
unclear
what
the
standard
of
review
would
be
in
court.
someone
has
suggested
arbitrary
and
capricious,
substantial
evidence--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it
is,
although
i
don't
think
it
follows.
it
would
not
surprise
me
to
find
out
that
95
percent
of
the
hospitals
are
charging
costs
that
are
beyond
those
that
would
be
charged
by
an
efficiently
and
economically
operated
hospital.
the
purpose
of
the
boren
amendment,
with
its
flexible
standard
and
the
express
conferring
of
rate-setting
authority
on
the
states,
was
to
drive
the
hospitals
to
efficiency.
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
difficult
task
for
a
judge
to
decide,
not
simply
what
costs
were
incurred,
but
in
an
ideal
world,
what
costs
should
have
been
incurred,
what
an
efficient
provision
of
care
would
entail.
that's
a
policy
judgment.
it's
one
which
congress
vested
in
the
states
in
this
system
of
findings
and
assurances.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
purpose
of
the
boren
amendment
was
to
give
the
states
the
flexibility
to
set
the
rates
that
must
be
incurred
to
provide
services.
for
example,
a
state
could
determine
that
a
particular
service
is
better
provided
on
an
out-patient
than
an
in-patient
basis,
and
therefore
be
willing
only
to
reimburse
the
services
at
the
out-patient
level.
thank
you,
your
honor.
