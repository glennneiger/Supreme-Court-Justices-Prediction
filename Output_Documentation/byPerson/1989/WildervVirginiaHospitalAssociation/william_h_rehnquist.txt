justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
88-2043,
gerald
baliles
v.
virginia
hospital
association.
ms.
guthrie?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
miss
guthrie.
mr.
roberts?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
dellinger?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
court
never
held
there
was
a
cause
of
action
under
the
previous
statute,
did
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
dellinger,
supposing
you
win
here,
and
then
the
arlington
hospital
goes
into
court
and
sues
a
year
from
now
saying
we
incurred
$10
million
in
costs,
the
virginia
people
have
only
reimbursed
us
for
$8
million.
what
issues
could
a
federal
court
consider
in
deciding
that
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
but
what
issues...
what
issues
could
the
federal
court
consider?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
if
the
district
judge
disagrees
with...
that
the
plan
is
reasonable,
he
doesn't
think
it
is
reasonable,
he
can
set
it
aside?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
does
he
do?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
another
plan
to
the
secretary?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
hospital
doesn't
get
any
money
judgment,
then?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what...
is
that
a
de
novo
standard
of
review?
does
the
federal
judge
decide
for
himself
whether
this
meets
the
federal
standard?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
told
them
to
come
up
with
another
number?
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if,
instead
of
seeking
administrative
review
of
those
principles,
you
went
into
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county
and
said
the
statute
requires
that
the
state
make
these
findings,
that
they
will
be
adequate;
the
state's
findings
are
inadequate?
why
not
go
into
the
circuit
court
of
fairfax
county
instead
of
the
district
court
of
the
eastern
district
of
virginia,
which
you
did?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dellinger.
miss
guthrie,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
you're
not
just
going
from
36
to
37?
