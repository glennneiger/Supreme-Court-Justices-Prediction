justice
kennedy
could
you
sue
the
secretary
under
the
apa
if
he
accepted
those
assurances
when
the
assurances
were
obviously
insubstantial?
justice
kennedy
in
your
view,
is
there
an
action
against
the
secretary
under
the
apa?
justice
kennedy
well,
why
is
the
secretary
so
limited?
just
because
it
has
to
do
with
assurances
that
are
satisfactory?
i
mean,
doesn't
the
secretary
have
to,
in
effect,
make
the
same
finding
the
state
does?
