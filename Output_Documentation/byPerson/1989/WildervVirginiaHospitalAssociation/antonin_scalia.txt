justice
scalia
but
what
about
a
federal
right
to
a
good-faith
determination
by
the
state,
and
to
a
good-faith
assurance?
at
least
that
is
categorical
in
the
act,
is
it
not?
justice
scalia
i'm
sure
you
would,
but
let's
assume
a
state
doesn't,
and
there's
all
sorts
of
evidence
that
this
is
all
tricked
up
and
it's
as
phony
as
can
be.
justice
scalia
why?
i
don't
know
why
you...
why
can't
you
say
that
the
scheme
is
such
that
your
protection
is
the
secretary?
the
assurances
are
made
to
him.
all
of
the
information
has
to
be
given
to
him.
why
isn't
it
constitutional
to
have
the
secretary
protect...
protect
the
hospitals.
that's
their
assurance--
justice
scalia
--and
if
the
secretary
doesn't
do
the
job,
then
the
hospitals
can
sue
him?
justice
scalia
mr.
roberts,
i
must
say
i
don't
see
that
line,
that
you
say
it's
all
in
the
hands
of
the
secretary
and
sue
him
if
you
have
any
problems,
unless
there
hasn't
been
any
filing
at
all.
why
couldn't
you
say
the
same
thing
for
that,
that
that's
up
to
the
secretary?
if
he
doesn't
move
against
the
state
because
of
the
state's
failure
to
file,
the
remedy
is
against
the
secretary?
justice
scalia
also,
the
secretary
could...
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
secretary
approves.
you're
saying
there
is
not
only
not
a
remedy
directly
here
against
the
state,
you're
saying
that
even...
there
is
not
even
any
remedy
against
the
secretary
no
matter
what
he
approves?
justice
scalia
no,
they
just
want
to
haul
the
secretary
in
to
be
sure
that
he's
doing
the
job
he's
supposed
to
under
the
statute.
why...
why
would
the
normal
judicial
review
that's
available
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
to
be
sure
that
the
secretary's
action
is
not
arbitrary
or
capricious,
why
is
that
suspended
here?
i
didn't
realize
you
were
taking
such
a--
justice
scalia
--polar
position
on
this.
justice
scalia
in
any
case,
it's
not
involved
here.
i
must
say,
though,
that
my
view
of
what
these
people
can
get
from
the
secretary
colors
to
some
extent
my
view
of
whether
they
have
any
action
here.
if
you're
telling
me
they
can't
get
anything
anywhere,
i
might
just
say,
you
know,
in
for
a
penny,
in
for
a
pound.
let's
let
them
sue
the
state.
justice
scalia
it
would
be
an
objective
fact
if
somebody
brings
a
suit
saying
the
secretary
is
not
even
looking
at
these
things.
they
don't
even
go
into
his
office.
nobody...
nobody
in
the
whole
agency
is
even
looking
at
them.
that
would
be
an
objective
fact,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
but
they
were
suing...
that
was
a
right
to
a
quite
different
substance
than
the
right
we
are
talking
about
here,
wasn't
it?
justice
scalia
what's
his
function
now,
mr.
dellinger?
what
is
the
secretary
supposed
to
do
now,
just
file
them?
he's
not
supposed
to
look
at
them
at
all?
justice
scalia
well,
it's
one
thing
to
say
they're
not
required
to
submit.
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
he
doesn't
have
some
obligation,
if
he
smells
something
wrong
or
somebody
complains,
to
probe
more
deeply,
ask
for
documentation
and
so
forth.
what
do
you
think
he
has
to
do?
i
mean,
the
way
you've
just
been
talking,
he's
been
read
out
of
the
act.
is
that
so?
justice
scalia
before
you--
justice
scalia
--can
you
think
of
any
other
instances
where
we
have
federal
courts
passing
upon
the
adequacy
of
state
plans?
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
federal
statutory...
or
several
federal
statutory
schemes
where
you
have
a
federal
administrator
approving
state
plans.
isn't
it
rather
extraordinary
to
have
state
plans
submitted
to
federal
judges...
and
this
will
go
on
annually,
won't
it?
i
mean,
every
time
a
state
makes
an
adjustment
in
its
rate
system?
justice
scalia
but
it
says
that
they
have
to
be
satisfactory,
to...
not
just
that
they
have
to
be
filed,
but
that
they
have
to
be
satisfactory
to
the
secretary.
i
don't
think
they're
talking
about
gastronomic
satisfaction.
[laughter]
i
think
he's
supposed
to
look
at
them
and
see
that
they
seem
to
be
in
rough
compliance,
right?
i
mean,
it's
not--
justice
scalia
--well,
but
surely
we
shouldn't
determine
what
the
federal
statute
means
on
the
basis
that
virginia
happens
to
provide
a
state
procedure?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
we're
trying
to
interpret
the
federal
statute,
and
i
guess
we
have
to
assume
that
a
state...
other
states
may
not
have
such
procedures--
justice
scalia
--whether
virginia
does
or
not.
