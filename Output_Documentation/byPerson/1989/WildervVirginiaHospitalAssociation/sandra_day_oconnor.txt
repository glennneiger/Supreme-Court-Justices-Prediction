justice
o'connor
ms.
guthrie,
do
you
think
that
the
legislation,
as
it
was
written
before
the
boren
amendment,
provided
a
private
cause
of
action?
justice
o'connor
i
see.
justice
o'connor
is
there
some
kind
of
right
of
action
to
require
the
state
to
include
reimbursement
provisions
in
the
plan?
justice
o'connor
is
there...
is
there
a
cause
of
action
to
require
at
least
that
much?
justice
o'connor
is
there
a
requirement
that
the
state
act
rationally
in
making
those
findings?
would
that
give
rise
to
a
cause
of
action?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
dellinger,
exactly
what
is
the
obligation
you
think
the
current
language
imposes
on
the
state?
justice
o'connor
so
if
there
is
a
cause
of
action
it's
only
to
assure
that
the
action
of
the
state
is
not
arbitrary
and
capricious?
justice
o'connor
well,
certainly
congress
apparently
intended
to
remove
from
the
secretary
the
obligation
for
any
detailed
enforcement--
justice
o'connor
--of
particular
standards.
justice
o'connor
but
you
would
have
us
increase
the
federal
oversight
by
virtue
of
having
the
federal
courts
do
what
the
secretary
cannot
do?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
there's
a
private
cause
of
action
to
achieve
results
and
have
federal
oversight
through
the
courts
that
could
not
be
obtained
by
the
secretary?
justice
o'connor
well,
it's
kind
of
curious
as
an
end
result,
though.
one
might
think
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
a
reduced
federal
involvement
across
the
board,
whether
it's
through
the
courts
or
the
secretary.
