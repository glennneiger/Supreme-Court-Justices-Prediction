ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
you
today
by
way
of
an
interlocutory
appeal
from
a
case
pending
in
the
eastern
district
of
virginia
which
concerns
the
administration
of
the
virginia
commonwealth's
medicaid
program.
the
case
concerns,
fundamentally,
the
significance
of
action
congress
took
in
1981
when
it
amended
the
social
security
act
by
way
of
what
is
now
commonly
called
the
boren
amendment.
the
boren
amendment
granted
states
new
authority
to
set
medicaid
payment
rates
for
in-patient
hospital
services.
exercising
this
new
authority
in
1982,
virginia
adopted
a
prospective
payment
system
as
its
method
for
reimbursing
hospital
rate...
hospitals
for
expenditures
for
medicaid
patients.
in
march
of
1986,
respondent
in
this
case,
the
virginia
hospital
association,
brought
suit
challenging
our
prospective
payment
system
on
the
ground
that
it
violated
the
terms
of
the
boren
amendment
because
it
under-reimburses
virginia
hospitals.
accordingly,
the
hospital
association
argued
that
our
system
is
inconsistent
with
federal
standards.
the
commonwealth
moved
for
dismissal
or
summary
judgment
on
several
grounds,
including,
among
other
things,
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
lack
of
enforceable
right
under
section
1983
and
collateral
estoppel,
and
the
district
court
initially
granted
judgment
on
the
collateral
estoppel
grounds,
but
that
decision
was
ultimately
reversed
by
the
fourth
circuit.
we're
now
before
you
on
appeals
from
subsequent
decisions
by
the
district
court
and
the
fourth
circuit
that
rejected
the
commonwealth's
grounds...
remaining
grounds
for
dismissal,
and
from
a
decision
fundamentally
that...
in
which
the
fourth
circuit
ruled
that
the
boren
amendment
guarantees
cost-efficient
hospitals,
a
substantive
federal
right
to
reasonable
and
adequate
reimbursement,
and
that
this
right
can
be
enforced
under
section
1983.
the
commonwealth
sought
certiorari
on
four
issues,
but
the
court
decided
to
grant
and
to
hear
only
this
one.
i
intend
to
focus
my
argument
today
on
two
key
points
relevant
to
our
principal
argument,
which
is
that
the
boren
amendment,
as
drafted,
does
not
secure
any
substantive
federal
rights
that
can
be
enforced
under
section
1983.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
there's
a
much
better
argument
that
could
be
made
there,
but
we
would
not
concede
that
point.
there
is
a
distinct
difference
in
the
language
between
the
boren
amendment
and
its
predecessor.
and
that
language...
the
change
in
the
language
is
to
incorporate
the
express
findings
and
assurances
requirement
and
also
to
expressly
repeal
the
cost-based
reimbursement
standard
reflected
in
the
prior
language.
the
prior
language
said
that
a
state
plan
for
medical
assistance
must
provide
for
the
payment
of
the
reasonable
cost
of
in-patient
hospital
services.
that
language
is
somewhat
similar
in
nature
to
other
standards
incorporated
in
the
social
security
act
that
this
court
has
held
enforceable.
but
what's
important
about
the
boren
amendment
is
that
it
doesn't
say
that
anymore,
that
it
makes
a
very
significant
change
that
must
not
be
overlooked
by
this
court.
the
boren
amendment
reflects
congressional
intention
to
interject
the
free
enterprise
system
into
the
medicaid
program.
under
cost-based
reimbursement,
hospitals
could
argue
that
they
were
entitled,
essentially,
to
present
a
bill
to
the
commonwealth
and
to
have
it
paid,
regardless
of
whether
the
charges
made
or
the
bill
presented
was
in
fact
necessarily
related
to
the
services
that
the
medicaid
recipients
were
entitled
to.
it
is
that
fundamental
change
that
we
would
stress
in
this
case.
and
our
second
important
point
today
is
that
the
language
of
the
boren
amendment
itself
doesn't
secure
any
substantive
federal
rights
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983.
the
only
requirement,
we
would
submit,
that
the
boren
amendment
now
imposes
on
the
states
is
an
administrative
obligation
to
make
findings
and
assurances
to
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services,
an
administrative
obligation
that
relates
to
how
we
administer
our
program,
not
to
any
entitlement
to
hospitals,
and
certainly
not
to
anything
that
would
remotely
resemble
an
industry
subsidy.
alternatively,
we
would
argue
that
even
if
the
boren
amendment
could
be
said
to
impose
an
obligation
to
make
payments
to
hospitals,
the
standards
for
determining
the
level
of
payment
to
be
made
under
the
boren
amendment
are
too
imprecise,
too
general,
too
open-ended
to
secure
any
specific
and
federal...
specific
and
definite
federal
rights
in
any
party.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
your
honor,
we
would
argue
that
in
fact
the
finding...
the
findings
and
assurances
language
requires
that
the
commonwealth
be
accountable
in
making
assurances
to
the
secretary,
and
certainly
the
presumption
of
regularity
of
administrative
and
state
action
would
obtain.
and
we
wouldn't,
obviously,
expect
a
state
to
make
a
finding
or
submit
an
assurance
that
was
patently
false
or
inaccurate.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
well,
i
think
that
what
i
would
hear
in
that
particular
question
and
would
submit
is
the
proper
argument
in
that
particular
case
is
that
what
the
state
has
done
is
arbitrary
and
capricious,
and
that
might,
in
fact,
state
some
sort
of
constitutional
plane
that
possibly
could
be
enforced
under
section
1983.
but
we
would
argue
that
a
statement
that
our
findings
and
assurances
are
arbitrary
and
capricious
does
not
state
a
claim
under
this
particular
statute.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
we...
we
think
that
there's
an
argument
that
could
be
made
that
the
administrative
procedure
act
would
permit
someone
to
sue
the
secretary
for
not
living
up
to
his
obligations,
but
we
do
not
believe
that
argument
is
persuasive
in
this
case
because
of
the
nature
of
the
right
arguably
created,
which
is
one
to
findings
and
assurances.
and
the
findings
and
assurances
that
are
required
are
so
defined
by
what
comes
after
that
language
that
by
their
terms
they
are
more
like
the
indefinite
language
this
court
recently
referred
to
in
webster
v.
doe,
language
that
might
even
foreclose
a
proper
administrative
procedure
act
review.
the
findings
and
assurances
require
the
state
to
make
a
number
of
different,
almost
legislative,
certainly
policy-laden
judgments.
first,
if
you
look
at
the
actual
language
of
the
statute,
it
says
that
a
state
plan
for
medical
assistance
must
provide
for
payment
of
hospital
services
through
the
use
of
rates,
so
we're
making
payment
for
the
use
of
rates,
which
the
state
finds
and
makes
assurances
satisfactory
to
the
secretary
are
reasonable
and
adequate
to
meet
the
cost
which
must
be
incurred
by
efficiently
and
economically
operated
facilities
in
order
to
provide
care
and
services
in
conformity
with
applicable
quality
and
safety
standards
and
state
and
federal
laws,
and
to
assure
individuals
eligible
for
medical
assistance
have
reasonable
access.
buried
in
that
somewhat
labyrinthine
language
which
is
added
to
an
already...
which
you
have
already
characterized
as
a
byzantine
statute,
are
several
mandates
for
findings:
one,
the
state
has
to
look
to
see
what
is
the
care
and
services
that
must
be
provided
in
conformity
with
applicable
state
and
federal
laws
and
regulations
and
quality
and
safety
standards.
and
once
we
know
what
the
level
of
care
that's
required
is,
then
we
have
to
ask,
now,
what
are
the
costs
that
have
to
be
incurred...
have
to
be
incurred
by
an
economically
and
efficiently
operated
hospital
in
order
to
provide
that
level
of
care?
and
once
we've
determined
what
those
mandated
costs
are...
because
economic
and
efficient
here
is
a
limitation,
not
an
expansion.
it's
meant
to
avoid
overpayment,
not
to
raise
questions
about
underpayment.
once
we
know
the
answer
to
the
question
of
what
costs
are
necessary,
only
then
do
we
get
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
rates
that
we
set
after
that
analysis
are
reasonable
and
adequate
to
meet
those
costs.
and
only
then,
once
we've
established
the
rates,
do
we
know
anything
about
payments.
now,
when
you
look
at
that
complexity,
and
when
you
look
at
the
kinds
of
judgments
that
are
buried
and
required
of
the
state
in
that
language,
i
think
it's
absolutely
necessary
to
conclude
that
is
the
sort
of
language
where
there
is
substantial
discretion
delegated
to
the
states
that
it
is
not
the
kind
of
language
ordinarily
determined
by
this
court
to
support
a
finding
of
specific
and
definite
rights.
contrast
the
language
of
the
boren
amendment
not
only
with
its
predecessor,
which
specifically
talked
about
cost-based
reimbursement,
but
contrast
it
too
with
sections
of
the
social
security
act
that
this
court
has
already
found
enforceable,
such
as
section
1902(a)(8)
of
the
social
security
act,
which
is
the
part
of
the
act
that
was
at
issue
in
edelman
v.
jordan,
one
of
your
most
important
holdings
about
enforceability
of
rights
under
section
1983,
under
the
medicaid
act.
that
section
required
that
a
state
plan
provide
that
all
individuals
wishing
to
made...
make
application
for
medical
assistance
under
the
plan
shall
have
the
opportunity
to
do
so,
and
that
such
assistance
shall
be
furnished
by
reason...
with
reasonable
promptness
to
all
eligible
individuals.
shall
have
the
opportunity
to
apply
for
assistance;
that
assistance
shall
be
provided
with
reasonable
promptness...
very
clear
language.
even
in
that
circumstance,
the
use
of
the
word
"reasonable"
was
interpreted
by
the
secretary
of
hhs'
regulations,
and
accordingly
could
be
easily
enforced
by
the
courts.
moreover,
the
language
of
the
boren
amendment
differs
dramatically
from
the
rights-granting
language
of
the
brooke
amendment,
which
was
at
issue
in
the
wright
v.
roanoke
development
and
housing
authority
case.
in
wright,
the
court
considered
the
effect
of
statutory
language
providing
that
tenants
could
be
charged
as
rent
no
more
and
no
less
than
30
percent
of
their
income,
and
the
meaning
of
the...
and
also
looked
at
the
meaning
of
an
implementing
regulation
that
included
within
that
30
percent
standard
a
reasonable
amount
for
utilities.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
that's
not
this
case.
in
this
case
we
have
an
acknowledgement
by
respondent
that
we
have
made
findings
and
assurances,
and
that
acknowledgement
is
bolstered
by
findings
of
fact
made
by
judge
merridge
in
the
mary
washington
hospital
case.
so
we're
in
a
circumstance
in
this
particular
case
where
that
question
is
not
an
issue.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
if
the
state
was
not
doing
its
job,
if
we
did
not
submit
satisfactory
assurances,
if
we've
made
no
payments,
for
example,
the
secretary--
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
--well,
the
secretary
certainly
in
the
first
instance
can
refuse
to
approve
our
state
plan,
can
withdraw
his
approval
and
can
refuse
to
provide
federal
participation--
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
--yes.
as
i
indicated
earlier,
if
our
actions
were
so--
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
--if
our
actions
were
wholly
arbitrary
and
capricious,
i
think
that
we
would
acknowledge
that
there
would
be
a
constitutional
claim
to
which
a
1983
action
might
attach.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
well,
i
think--
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
--i
think
that
that's
certainly
a
reasonable
interpretation.
i
was
only
meaning
to
suggest
that
because
of
the
level
of
state
action
involved
in
promulgating
the
state
plan
that's
at
issue
here...
we
have
to
promulgate
a
state
plan
under
our
administrative
procedure
act
as
well
as
under
the
public
notice
and
other
requirements
of
the
federal
law
in
this
particular
provision,
and
so
we
have
state
action--
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
--derived
from
this
federal-state
cooperative
program
that
might
be
independently
attacked,
you
know,
as
arbitrary
and
capricious.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
in
that
circumstance,
this
statute
is
one
that
clearly
sets
up
a
scheme
that
contemplates
that
the
states
will
be
accountable
and
the
secretary
will
be
charged
principally
with
assuring
that
the
states
follow
the
mandate
of
congress.
there
is
embodied
in
the
statute
a
delegation
to
the
states
which
is
very
broad
and
a
recognition
that
this
program
is
going
to
work
only
if
it
is
a
cooperative
program
of
the
state
and
federal
government.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
yes.
there
is
a--
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
--yes.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
that's
appropriate.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
thank
you.
i
think
i'd
like
to
use
my
time
in
part
to
try
to
clarify
a
little
confusion
that's
been
introduced
here
about
our
appeals
system.
first,
turning
to
pages
36
through
40
and...
well,
42
of
the
joint
appendix,
which
sets
out
the
formal
administrative
hearing
and
the
necessary
demonstrations
of
proof
that
are
available
to
hospitals,
it
says
the
hospital
shall
bear
the
burden
of
proof
in
seeking
relief
from
its
prospective
payment
rate,
that
a
hospital
seeking
additional
reimbursement
for
operating
costs
relating
to
the
provision
of
in-patient
care
shall
demonstrate
that
its
cost
exceed
the
limitations.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
right,
and
it
goes
through
several
pages,
i
think
and
ultimately
focuses
the
attention
of
the
director
and
the
hospitals
on
showing
what
the
medicaid
program
really
is
all
about.
it
directs
the
attentions
to
show
that
the
rates
that
the
receive
are
not
sufficient
to
cover
operating
costs
related
to
in-patient
care
in
a
manner
that's
sufficient
to
provide
care
that
conforms
to
applicable
quality
standards
or,
moreover,
it
also
directs
the
hospitals
to
put
their
proof
on
related
to
the
reasonable
access
standard.
that
was
congress'
purpose
in
enacting
the
medicaid
act
and
the
boren
amendment
was
intended
to
serve
it.
there's
no
issue
here
of
those--
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
--there
is
an
express
provision--
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
--there
is
an
express
provision
that
states
that
you
can't...
you
can't
review
the
principles
of
reimbursement.
that's
one
of
the
terms
of
the
administrative
mechanism.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
not
in
the
administrative
process,
but
section
32.1-325.1,
which
is
a
specific
statute
that
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief
on
page
10--
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
--of
the
reply
brief,
mr.
chief
justice.
on
page
10,
we
tried
to
clarify
this
matter
in
our
reply
brief.
virginia,
after
the
mary
washington
hospital
case,
enacted
a
specific
provision
that
overrides
the
general
apa
exclusion
for
grant
programs
and
says
specifically,
the
providers
have
a
right
of
judicial
review
of
reimbursement,
and
then
that
invokes
the
normal
standards
of
section
17
of
our
administrative
process
act
that
includes
the
right
to
bring
a
federal
question
issue
before
the
state
courts
on
judicial
review
of
the
administrative
determination.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
correct,
because
the
agency
doesn't
want
to
delegate
to
an
individual
hearing
officer
the
right
to
set
aside
its
medicaid
program.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
no.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
that's
correct.
ms.
r.
claire
guthrie
that's
correct,
and
we
did
not
interject
this
issue
in
order
to
say
that
it...
that
this
court
is
required
to
defer
to
those
state
procedures
necessarily.
the
whole
issue
of
foreclosure
is
one
that
you
need
only
address
if
you
determine
that
there's
a
substantive
federal
right
that's
secured
within
the
meaning
of
that
term
1983,
and
we
have
submitted,
and
we
continue
to
argue,
that
the
language
of
the
boren
amendment
in
its
complexity,
in
its
delegation
of
discretion,
in
its
lack
of
guidelines,
and
in
forming
the
terms
"reasonable
and
adequate",
"economic
and
efficient",
the
measure
related
to
assuring
access,
that
all
of
those
things
taken
together
are
a
statute
that
is
not
subject
to
judicial
enforcement
and
therefore
cannot
confer
any
substantive
federal
right
that
can
be
vindicated
here.
the
virginia
hospital
association
tries
to
make
much
of
two
lines
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
eleventh
amendment
repealer
about
not
wanting
to
change
the
status
quo
ante
with
respect
to
federal
and
state
rights.
what
they
haven't
told
you,
and
which
a
careful
reading
of
all
of
the
cases
that
they
refer
to
in
their
footnotes
will
show
you,
is
that
most
of
the
cases
that
had
been
in
existence
up
'til
that
point...
the
pre-1981
cases...
most
of
the
cases
involved
suits
against
both
the
secretary
and
the
states,
and
in
most
of
those
cases
the
relief
granted
was
against
the
secretary,
making
the
secretary
go
back
and
do
his
job
over
again.
the
amici
american
hospital
association
brief
recognizes
that
fewer
than
half
of
the
cases
that
were
decided
before
1981
involved
any
1983
claim
at
all,
many
of
the
issues
regarding
provider
rights
were
resolved
on
questions
of
standing,
which
is
why
you
see
the
parallel
interest
language
and
the
zone
of
interest
language
in
many
of
the
cases,
and
even
the
colorado
hospital
case
that
they
cite
to...
cited
to
in
argument
today
is
a
case
eminently
distinguishable
from
ours.
thank
you
very
much.
