justice
white
what
if
a...
the
state
just
doesn't
set
up
any
standards
at
all
for
reimbursement?
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
if
they
didn't
have
a
set
of
standards
they
wouldn't
have
presented
anything
to
the
secretary,
would
they?
justice
white
i
take
it
you
suggested
that
if
neither
the
state
nor
the
secretary
was
doing
its
job,
somebody
could
complain
in
court?
justice
white
so
what...
who
can
sue
whom
for
what?
justice
white
can
somebody
sue?
justice
white
can
somebody
sue
the
state?
justice
white
i
understand.
if
you
can
sue
when
you
don't
have
a
plan,
why
can't
you
sue
and
just
say
look,
the
plan
that
was
presented
is
just
wholly
arbitrary
and
capricious,
so
i
want
to
sue
the
state?
i
want
to...
it's
just
a...
it's
a
nonplan,
and
look
at
these
rates,
they're
just
too
low?
justice
white
well,
does
the
state
have
a
procedure
whereby
a
provider
can
say
look,
you
aren't
paying
me
enough?
justice
white
so
the...
and
is
that
reviewable
in
a
state
court?
justice
white
do
you
think
that
was
a...
the
cause
of
action
given
by
the
act?
justice
white
or
do
you
have
to
get
to
1983
or
something?
justice
white
he
gives
them
$2
million,
doesn't
he?
justice
white
well,
what
was
the
order?
justice
white
you
couldn't
get
any
money
out
of
the
state
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
is
that
it?
justice
white
--well,
isn't
there
some...
i
asked
your
opponent,
is
there
some
administrative
scheme
whereby
you
can
in...
take...
get
review
in
the
state
itself,
in
its
administrative
processes?
can
you
take
this
issue
up
there?
justice
white
didn't
your
adversary
suggest--
justice
white
--you
don't...
you
didn't
understand
her
that
way?
justice
white
well,
is--
justice
white
--is
the
only
way
you
can
argue
with
the
state
is
to
go
to
court,
or
can't
you
argue
in
their...
don't
they
have
some
administrative
structure?
justice
white
so
you
just
can't
go
in
and
say,
i
didn't
get
enough?
justice
white
well,
can
you
or
not?
justice
white
well,
what
can
you
say
in
an
administrative--
justice
white
--say,
you
didn't
multiply
right.
justice
white
now,
is
that
clear
as
a
bell
in
this...
is
it
in
the...
can
we
tell
that
that
is
so
in
this
record,
or
from
any
papers
that
you
can
read?
justice
white
--is
there
been
an
example
where
you've
utilized
the
state
appeals
procedure,
administrative
procedure,
and
then
gone
into
court
and
asked
the
court
to
review
the
principles
of
reimbursement
and
have
been
denied?
justice
white
well,
you
don't
know
whether
you
can
get
relief
in
the
virginia
court.
justice
white
well,
in
the
administrative
appeal.
how
about
in
court?
can
you
go
to
court
and
say
look,
these
fellows
won't
listen
to
principle?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
isn't
there
an
express
provision
that
you
cannot
review
the
principles
of
reimbursement?
justice
white
where
is
that?
justice
white
does
that
mean
that
you
can't
claim...
you
can't
claim
and
be
permitted
to
show
that
reimbursement
is
not
reasonable?
justice
white
but...
you
can't...
you
can't
do
it
in
the
administrative
process,
but
you
can
in
the
state
court,
is
that--
