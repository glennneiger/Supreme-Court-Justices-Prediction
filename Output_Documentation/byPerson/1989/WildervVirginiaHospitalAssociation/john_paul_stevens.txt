justice
stevens
mr.
roberts,
can
i
just
interrupt
to
ask
you
the
same
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked
earlier
of
your
colleague?
what
was...
what
is
your
view
of
the
situation
before
the
boren
amendment?
was
there
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
then?
justice
stevens
why,
i...
i
understand
that.
but
basically
you're
saying,
then,
that
even
if
there
was,
we
should
construe
the
boren
amendment
as
taking
away
a
preexisting
remedy?
justice
stevens
well,
that
isn't
quite
that
absurd,
is
it?
and
i
suppose
the
standard
would
be
quite
different
if
the
secretary
would
take
a
fresh
look
and
decide
whether
it
was
right,
whereas
they'd
have
a
much
heavier
burden
in
court,
wouldn't
they,
to
show
the
statute
was
violated?
justice
stevens
well,
they
allege
in
this
case
that
somebody
who
has
95
percent
of
the
hospitals
get
less
than
the...
their
costs
out
of
this,
and
they
say...
and
that
ergo,
it's
arbitrary.
isn't
that
their
theory?
justice
stevens
and
the
state
can
reasonably
find
that
95
percent
of
the
hospitals
in
virginia
are
inefficient.
that's
what
it
amounts
to.
justice
stevens
this
is
not
a
grant
of
state
or
federal
funds,
is
it?
is
it
a
grant?
justice
stevens
the
grant
includes--
