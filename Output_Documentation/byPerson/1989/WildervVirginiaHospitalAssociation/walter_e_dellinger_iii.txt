mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
response
to
questions
from
justice
o'connor
and
justice
stevens,
mr.
roberts
acknowledges
that
there
may
well
have
been
a
right
of
providers
to
sue
before
1981.
miss
guthrie,
on
behalf
of
the
state,
was
not
so
sure.
each
of
them,
however,
is
quite
convinced
that
somehow,
some
significant
change
was
made
in
1981
which
retracts
this
right
that
in
our
view
was
not
only
settled,
but
a
right
with
which
congress
was
extremely
well
aware.
providers
have
been
suing
under
these
reimbursement
agreements...
under
these
reimbursement
standards
of
congress
for
more
than
20
years.
the
first
case
to
come
to
the
court
of
appeals
was
decided
by
the
three-judge
court
in
catholic
university...
catholic
medical
center
v.
rockefeller
of
1969.
and
congress
was
sufficiently
aware
that
providers
were
suing
to
enforce
this
right--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--not
at
all.
the
standard
was
revised
in
1980
and
'81.
the
previous
standard
was
that
a
state
must
provide
the
reasonable
cost
of
providing
hospital
care.
in
the
1980
and
'81
amendments
for
nursing
home
care
and
hospital
care
congress
provided
the
present
language,
which
gives
states
the
flexibility
to
adopt
methods
of
reimbursement
that
encourage
efficiency.
the
state...
and
we
emphatically
agree
with
this...
with
the
state
on
this
point.
states
are
not
required
to
reimburse
the
actual
costs
of
all
hospitals.
they
are
required
to
reimburse
at
a
level
that
must
be
incurred
by
efficient
and
economical
providers
in
providing
care.
there's
nothing
in
that
change
in
the
standard
which
continues
to
be
enforceable
and
mandatory.
the
statute
says
a
state
plan
must
provide
for
payment
of
the
hospitals,
and
congress
has
never
stopped
with
simply
saying
you
must
pay
the
hospitals
a
reimbursement
for
the
costs
they
incur
in
providing
care.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
this
court
never
had
occasion
to
hold
that
there
was
a
cause
of
action
under
the
previous
statute,
but
the
sense
of
congress
on
that
point
could
not
be
clearer.
it's
not
merely
a
sense
from
matters
that
appear
in
floor
statements
or
in
committee
hearings.
congress
twice
in
the
'70s
passed
legislation
expressly
predicated
on
the
existence
of
an
underlying
cause
of
actions
upon
which
providers
could
sue.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
absolutely.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
the
secured
right
comes
from
the
medicaid
act,
the
cause
of
action
under
1983.
the
court
decisions
in
the
lower
courts
were,
in
the
main,
explicitly
based
on
1983.
congress
became
concerned
in
1975
that
the
1983
cause
of
action
for
future
injunctive
relief
wasn't
enough
of
a
remedy.
because
of
this
court's
decision
in
edelman
against
jordan,
a
provider
who
sued
in
the
'70s
and
challenged
the
state
for
failing
the
meet
the
minimum
reimbursement
standard
could
not
receive
compensatory
damages
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment
barrier.
so
congress
in
1975
passed
legislation
requiring
states
to
waive
their
eleventh
amendment
immunity
and
consent
to
be
sued
not
only
for
injunctive
relief
but
for
money
damages
as
well.
that
did
not
work
out
very
well.
many
state
legislatures
simply
weren't
meeting
in
time
to
comply
by
march
31
of
the
ensuing
year,
and
the
penalty
was
draconian...
a
10
percent
cut
in
medicaid
reimbursement
to
the
state...
so
the
congress
in
'76
withdrew,
repealed
the
statute
which
required
states
to
waive
their
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
it
obviously
makes
no
sense
to
require
a
waiver
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity
if
there's
no
underlying
right
to
sue,
but
congress
could
not
have
been
clearer
and
the
solicitor
general
in
his
brief
in
the
final
footnote,
page
23,
note
16,
notes
that
the
house
and
senate
report
explicitly
state...
they
say
observe
in
passing...
explicitly
state,
with
an
interesting
ellipsis
here,
that
after
the
repeal
"providers
can
continue"
dot,
dot,
dot,
"to
institute
suit
for
injunctive
relief
in
state
or
federal
courts.
"
the
ellipsed
matter
is:
",
of
course".
i
mean,
it
was
so
well
established
that
this
statement...
the
position
of
undersecretary
marjorie
lynch
in
her
testimony,
assistant
secretary
kersman,
the
repeal
of
this
legislation...
should
not
be
interpreted
as
placing
constraints
on
the
right
of
parties
to
seek
prospective
injunctive
relief
in
a
state
or
federal
judicial
forum.
it
could
not
have
been
clearer
that
"of
course"
providers
had
a
right
to
sue
to
enforce
this
standard.
congress,
as
it
had
done
previously...
congress
has
modified
this
statute
in
'69,
'72,
'75,
'76,
'80
and
'81.
the
last
'81
standards
are
intended
to
encourage
efficiency
on
the
part
of
hospitals
by--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
obligation
that
the
current
language
imposes
on
the
state
is
to
come
up
with
a
plan
that
is
not
arbitrary
and
capricious.
it
is
not
certain
what
the
standard
will
be
on
the
merits.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
has
not
been
finally
settled
in
the
lower
courts
that
have
heard
this
so
far.
it
may
well
be
that
that's
where
the
standard
comes
out,
because
the
statutory
language
is
"reasonable
and
adequate".
that
obviously
gives
the
state
some
room
and
flexibility.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that's
correct,
and
that
is
i
think
essential
to
what
happened
in
1980
and
'81.
i
think
the
solicitor
general
concedes,
as
he
must,
that
there
was
a
right
to
sue
before
'80
and
'81,
and
one
of
the
principal
changes
in
1980
and
'81
was
to
reduce
the
oversight
role
of
the
federal
secretary.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no.
the
court's
role
is
simply
to
see
that
the
federal
statute
has
been
enforced,
that
it
has
been
complied
with
by
the
states.
only
in
those
instances--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--yes,
and
in
fact
the
access
to
federal
court
is...
makes
more
sense
once
the
secretary's
role
has
been
diminished,
that
is,
prior
to
1980
and
'81
it
was
more
arguable
that
the
secretary's
function,
which
was
then
a
review
and
approval
function,
provided
the
remedy
that
was
necessary.
now,
this
has
been
decentralized.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
there's
absolutely
no
evidence
of
that
in
the
legislative
history,
of
reducing
the
role
of
the
courts.
what
congress
did
want
to
do
is
to
decentralize
the
function
of
adopting
a
reimbursement
methodology.
previously,
the
secretary
had
exercised
something
like
a
command
and
control
function.
when
the
secretary
engaged
in
that
function,
conceivably
there
could
have
been
meaningful
apa
review.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
that
is
the
position
of
the
department
of
justice,
that
the
secretary...
in
its
brief,
the
solicitor
general
says,
at
page
5
of
its
brief,
"the
states
are
not
required
to
submit
to
the
secretary
the
findings
themselves
or
the
underlying
data
or
analysis.
"
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think
that
is
largely
correct.
that
is,
at
page
20
of
their
brief
the
solicitor
general
says
that
"consistent
with
this
legislative
history,
the
secretary
has
maintained.
"
--whether
he
gets
chevron
deference
in
this
judgment
i
don't
know,
but
the
secretary
has
maintained
that
the
statutory
provision
"does
not
require
him
to
analyze
or
verify
the
state's
findings.
"
partly
because
we've
now
switched
to
a
system
from
one
in
which
the
secretary
had
a
command
and
control
function.
there
are
other
areas
of
the
medicaid
act
where
the
secretary
continues
to
be
the
effective
decision-maker,
but
here
congress
has
decentralized
to
the
point
where
it
is
the
state
which
finds
that
its
plan
meets
the
requirement
of
the
statute
of
being
reasonable
and
adequate
reimbursement.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
the
fact
that
they
had
incurred
$10
million
in
cost
and
the
state
had
only
reimbursed
them
$8
million
would
by
no
means
suggest
that
they
were
entitled
to
win.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
cases
that
have
gone
to
judgment
in
the
courts
of
appeal,
and
we
have
a
number
now
that
have
been
decided,
you
can
see
the
process
that
the
federal
court...
a
federal
court
can
go
through.
the
state
officials
are
asked
to,
in
a
sense
come
forward
and
explain
how
their
system
was
designed
and
what
is
the
theory
that
this
is
a
reasonable
and
adequate
rates
that
would
meet
the
costs
that
must
be
incurred.
that
is
not
an
impossible
finding.
i
think
it's
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--not
at
all.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
i
mean
if--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
he...
by
disagreeing...
i
think
i
now
understand,
you
want
to
know
just
what
the
result
is.
the
result
is
that
he
disapproves
the
state
plan
and
the
state
is
required
to
submit
another
plan,
to
make
another
annual
finding.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
to
come
up
with...
to
come
up
with
another
plan.
that's
essentially--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--not
at
all,
not
from
the
federal
district
court.
the
only
relief,
as
far
as
i
know,
in
any
of
these
cases
is
that
the
state
plan
be
disapproved
and
that
perhaps
if
it
is
an
amendment
to
a
state
plan
which
is
being
eliminated
that
you
call
back.
the
state
is
given
an
order.
the
state
is
ordered
by
the
court...
as
i
understand
the
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals
cases...
to
submit
a
plan,
to
come
up
with
a
new
plan
that
meets
the
federal
standards.
we
have
cases
that
have
gone
to
trial
on
this.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
the
federal
judge
obviously
must
make
in
the
final
analysis
a
determination
of
whether
the
state's
plan
meets
the
federal
requirement,
but
that's
not
the
same
as
a
federal
judge
having
to
decide
what
he
thinks
is
reasonable.
that
is
to
say,
i
think
edmond
kahn
once
said
it's
much
easier
to
identify
instances
of
injustice
than
it
is
to
find
justice.
see,
a
court
is
only
asked
to
identify
instances
in
which
a
state
plan
is
unreasonable.
let
me
give
you
an
example,
if
i
may.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
yes.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
there
have
been,
i
think,
in
the
history
of
this
provision
only
42
actions
brought.
i
assume
that
in
most
cases...
there
are
only
suits
pending
in
18
states
at
the
present
time.
i
think
most
states
are
in
fact
in
compliance,
judging
by
those
figures.
they
are...
they
have
a
variety
of
different
methodologies,
just
in
the
way
in
that,
when
we
get
our
travel
expenses
reimbursed
there
are
lots
of
different
ways
in
which
payers
calculate
our
travel
expenses,
but
all
of
them
seem
to
be
a
method
to
determine...
to
be
in...
actually
a
method
of
determining
reasonableness
and
adequacy.
but
you
have
cases,
like
the
colorado
case
brought
by
st.
mark's
hospital
and
denver
lutheran
that
has
now
gone
to
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
which
the
state...
again
it
was
a
case
like
virginia's
where
not
a
single
hospital...
not
90
percent
but
100
percent...
not
a
single
hospital
was
receiving...
was
being
reimbursed
its
cost
of
providing
care.
in
colorado,
the
state's
method
was
to
use
one
of
the
medicare
methods
of
determining
cost
per
patient
day,
and
at
the
next-to-bottom
line
the
state
simply
multiplies
by.54.
they
simply
cut
the
amount
in
half.
that's
not
a
very
difficult
judgment
for
a
court
to
make,
and
particularly
when
the
state
has
no
theory.
it's
as
if
they
said,
we
take
the
numbers
and
multiply
them
by
last
tuesday's
trifecta
number.
i
mean,
the
trial
court
asked
the
state,
by
what
method
or
theory
do
you
assume
that
multiplying
by.54
and
cutting
the
figures
in
half
will
result
in
reimbursement
that
meets
the
costs
that
must
be
incurred?
the
state
essentially
had
no
answer,
so
that
the
court
was
able
to
conclude
that
the
record
was
"flagrantly
devoid
of
any
effort
to
make
the
federal
required
findings.
"
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
it
told
them
to
come
up
with...
some
numbers
are...
you
have
a
theory.
one
of
the
first
things
the
state
did
was
multiply
medicare
rates
by.88,
but
they
had
a
theory
that
it
was
less
expensive
to
treat
medicaid
patients
than
medicare
patients,
so
they
had
a
theory.
but
then
when
they
cut
it
in
half,
they
had
no
theory.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
the
order
was
simply,
in
that
case,
to
hold
that
the
state
plan
was...
failed
to
meet
the...
the
state
was
failing
to
comply
with
the
statutory
requirement
that
it
pay
providers
in
accordance
with
a
plan
that
is
reasonable
and
adequate
to
meet
the
costs
that
must
be
incurred,
and
the
state
was
ordered
to--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--that's
right.
there's
no
retrospective
damages,
so
the
state
is
only
required
to
come
up
with
a
new
plan,
which
colorado
has
done.
colorado
has
now
come
up
with
a
new
plan
and
now
has
joined
the
ranks
of
other
states
that
find
it
quite
possible
to
come
up
with
a
plan
that
meets
this
federal
standard.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
if
there
is
an
action
against
the
secretary
under
the
apa,
there
would
be
very
little
for
the
court
to
review
because
the
secretary's
role
is
so
limited
and
the
department
of
justice
has
taken
the
position,
as
it
did
in
illinois
health
care
v.
suiter...
the
department
of
justice
moves
to
dismiss
the
secretary
whenever
the
secretary
is
sued
now.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no.
the
secretary...
the
state
plan...
when
a
new
state
plan
is
adopted,
it
must
be
submitted
to
the
secretary.
and
the
department
has
taken
the
position,
as
the
secretary
has,
that
he
only
reviews
formal
compliance.
he
looks
and
sees
if
the
state
has
in
fact
rendered
an
assurance.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
one
would
think
that
the
secretary
would
scrutinize
these
submissions,
but
it's...
there
is
a
critical
point
here.
there
are
two
requirements
in
the
statute.
one
is
that
the
state
submit
assurances
satisfactory
to
the
secretary,
but
that's
a
backstop
requirement.
the
fundamental
obligation
is
that
the
state
find
that
it's
plan
meets
the
federal
standard.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
absolutely
not.
this
issue
may
not
be
brought
in
the
state
administrative
appeals
procedure.
the...
at
no
point
has
the
state
ever
said
that
you
can
challenge--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
she--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--the
way
the
dialogue
proceeds
on
this
question...
i
did
not
understand
her
to
say
that,
because
the
dialogue
proceeds
as
follows:
we
say,
since
the
secretary
is
providing
no
remedy,
and
in
fact
the
findings...
the
annual
findings
do
not
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
secretary.
the
findings
are
an
annual
requirement.
the
secretary
only
even
sees
us
when
there's
a
new
plan--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--but
on
the
state
side--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--here's
the
state's
administrative
structure,
and
they
do
say
this:
the
federal
statute
and
the
regulations
say
that
a
state
plan
has
to
provide
procedures
for
prepayment
and
postpayment
claims
review
"with
respect
to
such
issues
as
the
state
agency
determines
appropriate.
"
when
we
say
there's
no
remedy,
the
state
says,
oh,
yes,
we
have
an
elaborate
three-tiered
administrative
appeals
process.
but
we
look
at
the
plan,
and
the
plan
says,
you
may
not
challenge
the
principles
of
reimbursement.
the
plan
for
long-term
care
says,
and
i
quote,
"the
principles
of
reimbursement
are
not
appealable.
"
and
we
respond
with
that;
to
which
they
say
well,
nobody's
perfect.
i
mean,
there's...
the
plan
doesn't
allow
you
to
bring
the
issue
that
we
want
to
litigate,
and
i
understand
this
is
not
necessarily
a
critique
of
the
plan.
the
state
administrators
are
not
appeals
officials,
are
not
chief
justice
john
marshalls.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
no.
here's
what
you
can
do--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--not
at
all.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
you
can
say
they've
miscalculated
your
reimbursement.
suppose,
for
example,
the
state
plan
provides
that
you
get
one-third
of
your
cost.
you
can
go
into
the
state
appellate
process--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--you
can
go
in
and
say
look,
you
calculated
this
at
33
percent
and
we
believe
that
one
third
means
33-1/3
percent,
and
the
state
plan
says
one-third.
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
at
page
2,
the
solicitor
general...
the
solicitor
general
says
at
page
2
that
we
want
to
bypass
the
state
administrative
procedures,
but
at
page
6
the
solicitor
general
says,
"the
commonwealth
medicaid
appeals
procedure
precludes
administrative
review
of
the
principles
of
medicaid
reimbursement
under
the
plan.
"
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
the
virginia
apa
has
a
provision
that
grants
of
state
or
federal
funds
are
exempted
from
the
judicial
review
provisions.
there's
no
definitive
judgment
of
the
virginia
supreme
court,
but
that
provision
that
exempts
grants
of
federal
funds
from
apa
review,
and
the
provision
that
says
that
the
validity
of
any
statute,
regulation,
standard
or
policy,
state
or
federal,
upon
which
the
action
of
the
agency
was
based
shall
not
be
subject
to
review
by
the
court,
appear
to
preclude
any
access
to
court.
the
state
administrative
system
clearly
does
not--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--this
involves
a
grant
of
state
or
federal
funds
and--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--conceivably
the
virginia
supreme
court
would
decide
differently,
but
it's
important
to
note
that
once
you're
closed
out
of
the
state
administrative
appeals
process,
because
it
doesn't
allow
you
to
challenge
the
principles
of
reimbursement,
there's
nothing
in
the
federal
medicaid
act
that
requires
state
court
judicial
review.
so
that
any
review
that
might
exist
by
happenstance,
the
availability
of
which
would
be
entirely
a
matter
of
individual
state
law,
cannot,
as
this
court
held
in
wright
v.
city
of
roanoke,
foreclose
a
remedy
under
section
1983.
the
state
simply
doesn't
identify,
as
we
can
see
it,
any
plausible
basis.
i
think
in
the
end
that
what
happened
in
1980
and
'81
was
very
significant
for
what
congress
did
not
say,
after
manifesting
its
concern
with
provider
remedies
and
having
an
extensive
legislative
history.
the
congress
is
said
to
have
taken
away
and
extinguished
provider's
right
to
sue,
with
no
mention...
there's
not
a
word
in
the
legislative
history,
the
extensive
legislative
history
in
'80
and
'81,
that
says,
oh,
in
addition,
we're
making
another
major
change.
we're
extinguishing
the
right
of
providers
to
sue
in
state
and
federal
court
which
we've
legislated
about
in
'75
and
'76.
it's
being
extinguished
by
this
statute.
that
is,
in
this
case,
the
dog
that
did
not
bark.
there's
not
a
word
that
congress
was
withdrawing
a
right
of
which
congress
was
fully
and
clearly
aware.
it
seems
to
me
that
two
approaches
have
been
argued
here
today
to
take
away
the
right
to
sue.
one
of
those
approaches
would
have
this
court
hold
that
a
state's
plan
always
meets
the
statutory
standard,
no
matter
how
arbitrary,
capricious,
unsupported
or
untrue
its
plan
might
be.
the
other
would
acknowledge
the
existence
of
the
statutory
right
but
shut
the
doors
of
the
state
and
federal
courthouses
to
the
only
effective
means
that
providers
have
of
enforcing
the
requirements
of
this
statute.
i
think
either
one
of
those
approaches
would
breathe
an
unhealthy
skepticism
and
a
lack
of
respect
for
federal
law.
the
state
says...
it
takes
umbrage
in
its
brief
at
our
suggestion
that...
they're
saying
that
a
false
finding
satisfies
this
statutory
standard.
but
the
state
itself
says
that
we
acknowledge
that
the
commonwealth
has
made
the
findings
required
by
the
statute.
i
thought,
when
did
we
ever
say
that...
acknowledge
that
the
state
had
made
the
required
findings
under
the
statute?
they
cite
the
complaint,
footnote
12...
i
mean,
the
complaint,
paragraph
12,
which
says
that
the
assurances
and
findings
provided
by
the
commonwealth
were
inaccurate.
the
state...
the
heart
of
the
state's
position
is,
as
it
must
be,
that
a
state's
requirement
to
find
is
satisfied
by
an
inaccurate
finding.
that
simply
does
not
square
with
what
this
court
held
in
wright
v.
city
of
roanoke,
where
the
statute
said
the
regulations
involved
spoke
of
reasonable
utility...
reasonable
amounts
of
utilities
determined
in
accordance
with
the
public
housing
authority's
schedule
of
allowances.
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
what
the
state
finds
to
be
reasonable
and
adequate
in
this
case
and
what
the
state
authority
determined
to
be
reasonable
in
city
of
richmond
public
housing
authority,
in
roanoke.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
state's
finding
is
to
mean
anything,
then
this
case
is
one
in
which--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--no,
your
honor.
the
state
filed...
the
providers
filed
appeals
in
the
state
court
system,
but
those
have
been
stayed
pending
this
litigation
and
the--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--we
are
quite
certain
that
relief
is
not
available
in
the
state
appeals
process,
because--
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
--you
mean
go
to
state
court?
mr.
walter
e.
dellinger,
iii
well,
we
can
certainly
go
to
state
court
under
section
1981
as
long
as
the
virginia
courts
are
open,
but
there
does
not
appear
to
be
any
state
appeal
otherwise.
