mr.
wallace,
you
mentioned
this
was
a
reviewed
decision.
unanimous
in
the
tax
courts?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
have
any
explanation
why
it
has
taken
so
long
to
get
this
case
here?
one
of
the
tax
years
here
is
15
years
ago,
1974.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
gets
so
that
the
interest
sometimes
exceeds
the
basic
tax,
and
this
certainly
isn't
justice,
normally.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
why
were
they
not
segregated?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
mean
if
they
were
segregated
some
state
rule
would
be
violated?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
my
question
is
why
weren't
they
segregated
to
avoid
all
this
litigation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
first
of
these
cases
is
no.
88-1319,
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
against
the
indianapolis
power
&
light
company.
as
the
title
indicates,
it
is
an
income
tax
case,
the
respondent,
the
utility
is
a
regulated
indiana
utility
and
it
is
also
an
accrual
basis
tax
payer.
it
requires
customers
having
suspect
credit
to
make
deposits
with
it
to
assure
prompt
payment
of
future
electric
bills.
deposits
at
all
times
are
subject,
however,
to
the
companyâ€™s
use
and
control.
it
does
not
treat
them
as
income
at
receipt
but
carries
them
on
its
books
as
current
liabilities.
and
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
deposits
are
advance
payments
for
electricity
and
therefore
are
taxable
to
the
utility
in
the
year
of
receipt.
the
tax
court
ruled
that
the
principal
purpose
of
the
deposits
was
to
serve
as
security
rather
than
as
prepayment
of
income.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit
agreed
and
affirmed.
and
because
of
the
conflict,
the
direct
conflict
with
the
eleventh
circuit,
we
took
the
case.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
hold
that
the
deposits
are
not
advance
payments
for
electricity
and
therefore,
do
not
constitute
taxable
income
to
the
utility
upon
receipt.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
