justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
do
you
concede
that
under
the
applicable
utility
regulations
and
general
accounting
principles,
that
these
deposits
have
to
be
recorded
as
liabilities
of
the
company?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then,
it
seems
strange
then
that
the
government
would
take
the
position
that
it
does
here
on
the
taxability
of
these
deposits.
what
if
the
deposits
were
escrowed?
would
you
be
taking
the
same
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
wallace,
what
would
you
do
with
a
security
deposit
that
secures
both
the
covenants
in
a
normal
security
deposit
and
also
could
be
applied
to
the
last
month's
rent,
if
unpaid...
or
services?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
test
would
you
propose
be
applied
to
one
of
these
mixed
applicability
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
the
company
now
escrow
the
funds?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
company
could
have
followed
such
a
policy,
too,
so
it's
a
peculiar
argument.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
sort
of
a
test
do
you
think
should
govern
the
taxability
of
these
monies?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
think
it
makes
a
difference
whether
interest
is
paid
on
it
or
not?
