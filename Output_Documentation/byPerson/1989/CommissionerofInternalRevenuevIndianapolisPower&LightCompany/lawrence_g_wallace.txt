mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
tax
court,
in
a
reviewed
decision,
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit,
rejected
the
position
of
the
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
previously
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit,
that
customer
deposits
required
by
a
public
utility
to
ensure
payment
of
future
bills
are
income
to
the
utility
upon
receipt.
the
case
involves
only
the
tax
treatment
of
the
deposit
itself.
the
question
in
this
case
does
not
affect
the
tax
treatment
of
the
utility's
earnings
from
third
parties,
such
as
banks
through
investment
of
the
deposit
monies.
the
parties
here--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
concede
that
that
is
an
accepted
accounting
practice
which
the
company
is
following,
insofar
as
i
am
aware
that
is
the
practice
approved
by
the
public
service
commission.
whether
or
not
it
requires
that,
i
am
not
aware.
but
i
certainly
concede
that
that
is
an
accepted
accounting
practice
that
is
followed
by
the
company
in
its
financial
accounting.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
we
would
not.
the
position
depends
on
the
fact
that
the
monies
come
into
the
dominion
and
control
of
the
utility
company,
and
are
not
segregated
from
the
other
assets
of
the
company,
and
are
subject
to
its
unfettered
use.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
under
our
tax
system,
and
in
particular
for
an
accrual
basis
taxpayer,
it
has
to
have
a
right
to
the
use
of
the
monies
within
its
own
dominion
and
control.
the
cases
do
establish
that
as
a
criterion
for
taxability.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
a
form
of
economic
reality,
justice
scalia,
in
that
that
means
that
the
company
can
use
the
monies
as
its
own,
as
it
sees
fit,
to
produce
whatever
earnings
it
can
produce--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
perhaps
there
would
be
a
basis
for
making
such
an
argument,
but
that
is
not
the
position
the
commissioner
has
taken.
the
commissioner's
position
is
based
on
the
receipt
of
funds
within
the
dominion
and
control
of
the
utility
company.
the
parties--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
was
unanimous.
it
was
reviewed
because
the
previous
decision
of
the
tax
court
in
the
city
gas
case
had
been
reversed
unanimously
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
so,
all
three
lower
court
decisions
that
have
addressed
this
have
been
unanimous,
and
somebody
had
to
have
been
wrong.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
these
things
do
tend
to
get
sorted
out
many
years
after
the
taxable
years
at
issue.
the
litigation,
once
it
was
under
way,
after
the
audit
was
made,
moved
forward.
the
parties
stipulated
both
the
facts
and
the
calculation
of
the
tax
consequences
that
would
ensue
for
the
years
at
issue
should
be
commissioner's
position
prevail.
so,--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
in
any
event
the
issue
is
now
before
this
court
for
resolution.
and
under
the
commissioner's
legal
view,
there
are
only
two
factual
determinations
in
these
stipulated
facts
recited
by
the
tax
court
that
are
critical
here,
and
indeed
are
dispositive
under
his
legal
view.
and
in
light
of
those
two
determinations,
the
remaining
details
of
the
way
this
program
was
administered
become
immaterial.
one
is
the
one
to
which
we
have
already
adverted,
that,
and
this
is
set
forth
on
page
23a
of
our
appendix
to
the
petition
in
the
tax
court's
opinion,
that
the
deposits
were
not
segregated
from
the
petitioner's
general
funds,
the
utility's
general
funds,
and
were
subject
to
its
unfettered
use
and
control.
and
the
other
critical
determination,
set
forth
on
page
20a
of
the
same
appendix,
is
that
the
intended
purpose
of
the
deposits
was
to
ensure
payment
of
future
utility
bills
by
the
customers
required
to
make
the
deposits.
the
commissioner's
position
originated
in
a
1972
revenue
ruling
which
we
cite
that
considered
the
implications
for
utility
deposits
of
a
series
of
three
decisions
rendered
by
this
court
and
of
related
lower
court
decisions.
those
decisions,
and
this
court's
previous
decisions
in
the
area,
are
unchallenged
by
the
respondent
here,
and
of
course
unchallenged
in
the
courts
below.
those
decisions
established
that
advanced
payments
for
goods
and
services
to
be
provided
in
the
future,
that
an
advance
payment
is
taxable
income
in
the
year
of
receipt.
and
the
difficult
question
which
was
decided
in
this
series
of
cases
is
the
one
suggested
by
justice
o'connor's
question
at
the
outset,
whether
that
should
be
true
for
accrual
basis
taxpayers,
whether
to
that
extent
the
commissioner
had
authority
to
set
aside
the
accrual
basis
taxpayers'
accounting
method
and
insist
on
conformity
in
this
respect
for
the
advance
payments
received
on
an
annual
accounting
method.
and
that
was
the
decision
made
in
various
factual
situations
in
the
auto
club
of
michigan
case,
the
american
automobile
association
case,
and
finally
in
schlude
against
the
commissioner.
and,
as
the
court
put
it
in
the
american
automobile
association
case,
the
deferral
of
the
advance
payment
for
accounting
purposes,
and
i
am
quoting
now,
doubtless
presents
a
rather
accurate
image
of
the
total
financial
structure
is
sound
for
financial
accounting
purposes,
but
fails
to
respect
the
criteria
of
annual
tax
accounting,
and
may
be
rejected
by
the
commissioner.
and
in
those
decisions
the
court
relied
on
section
446(b)
of
the
current
code
and
its
predecessor,
section
41
of
the
1931
code,
which
gives
the
commissioner
authority
when
he
determines
that
the
taxpayer's
accounting
method
does
not
accurately
reflect
income
to
require,
in
his
discretion,
that
the
taxpayer
use
a
method
that
does
accurately
reflect
income.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
precisely
our
position.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that...
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
operates
precisely
the
way
an
advance
payment
operates.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
correct.
and
the
advance--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
but
the
security
deposit,
when
it
would
be
applied
against
a
month
in
which
the
customer
defaults
in
his
obligation,
or
when
it
is
refunded,
the
taxpayer
would
get
the
same
credit
for
it.
it
would
operate
precisely
the
same--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
that
might
not
be
the
very
end
of
the
cycle.
the
customer
may
default
in
january
and
the
security
deposit
may
be
applied
to
pay
that
bill
at
that
time,
and
the
utility
would
get
the
credit
for
it.
just
as
if
it
took
an
advance
payment
that
was
designated
for
the
december
bill,
it
would
have
to
wait
until
the
very
end
of
the
cycle.
i
mean,
that
doesn't
really
differentiate
the
economic
effect
of
treating
the
security
deposit
the
same
as
an
advance
payment
when
it's
intended
for
the
same
purpose.
and
that
is
to
assure
payment
of
the
income
that
the
utility
is
concerned
about
in
getting
either
the
advance
payment
or
the
security
deposit.
the
security
deposit
amounts
to
a
label
on
it,
whereas
here
it
is
intended
to
secure
the
future
payment
of
bills
for
goods
or
services
to
be
provided.
but
it
is
not
meaningfully
different
from
the
advance
payment
that
is
collected
on
that
same
understanding.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
the
difficult
factual
question
that
sometimes
has
to
be
determined
in
these
cases,
as
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
in
the
city
gas
company
recognized--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
agree
completely
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
in
the
city
gas
company,
which
agreed
with
the
commissioner's
position
in
that
case,
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
particular
deposit
is
determinative.
here,
there's
really
no
doubt
about
the
purpose
of
the
security
deposit.
it
not
only
was
a
finding
by
the
tax
court,
but
under
the
rules
of
the
public
service
commission,
it
can
be
required
only
of
customer
after
an
objective
inquiry
into
their
credit
worthiness,
and
only
of
the
5
percent,
as
it
turns
out,
of
customers
with
respect
to
whom
the
utility
may
be...
have
a
basis
for
concern
about
payment
of
the
future
bills.
if
it
were
a
deposit
to
secure
the
property
of
the
utility
company
it
would
be
presumably
required
of
all
customers.
but
those
who
are
required
to
pay
it
are
those
who
are
determined
to
be
credit
risks.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
are,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
many
exceptions
that
have
been
developed
in
revenue
rulings
and
in
a
revenue
procedure
that
the
commission
has
adopted
and
in
statutes
that
congress
has
enacted,
that
allow
deferral--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
allow
deferral
of
payments
under
which,
you
know,
the
possible
full
sweep
of
the
holdings
of
this
court
in
the
trilogy
of
cases
i
have
mentioned
has
been
receded
from.
and
this
can
be
done
permissibly
through
administrative
practice
or
by
congress,
and
some
of
the
administrative
concessions
have
perhaps
been
made
with
a
view
toward
preserving
those
victories
to
the
extent
they
have
been
preserved.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
there
may
be
an
inconsistency
in
the...
in
the
sense
that
the
commissioner
found
that
in
that
factual
context
it
was
necessary
to
make
a
different
type
of
factual
inquiry,
and
there
would
be
different
material
questions.
there
is,
in
our
view,
no
inconsistency
and
no
necessary
symmetry
between
the
way
the
commissioner
treats
the
recipient
of
the
deposit
and
the
way
the
tax
laws
treat
the
customer.
and
i
think
that
can
be
an
unnecessary
distraction.
if
i
may,
for
example,
in
an
ordinary
sales
transaction,
if
a
business
purchases
an
airplane
or
a
boat
or
a
truck
for
use
in
its
business,
it
may
pay
cash
and
the
vendor
may
have
to
treat
that
as
income
when
received.
but
the
purchaser
may
well
be
required
to
amortize
the
payment
over
a
period
of
the
useful
life
of
the
item
that
was
purchased.
and
that
is
true
whether
the
vendor
was
an
american
company
subject
to
federal
income
tax
or
whether
a
similar
boat
was
purchased
from
a
foreign
company
not
subject
to
federal
tax
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
and...
but,
what
is
required
in
each
case
is
to
determine
what
the
purpose
of
the
particular
receipt
is.
and
here,
when
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
purpose
was
to
secure
in
advance,
to
ensure
the
payment
for
goods
and
services
to
be
delivered
in
the
future,
that
is
a
basis
for
determining,
whether
it
is
a
utility
or
a
livestock
producer;
there
is
just
a
different
context
in
which
to
make
a
factual
inquiry.
that
is
the
basis
for
determining
that
that
is
to
be
treated
no
differently
from
any
other
form
of
advance
payment
for
future
goods
or
services,
when
that
is
the
reason
that
the
money
is
received,
and
when
the
money
is
subject
to
the
dominion
and
the
control
of
the
utility
upon
receipt.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
facts
and
circumstances
that
they
looked
at,
and
that
the
tax
court
looked
at,
seem
immaterial
to
us,
and
therefor
will
give
rise,
if
each
court
is
to
look
at
them
in
each
case,
to
erratic
results
that
don't
reflect
the
economic
reality
of
the
situation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it...
it
does
once
a
determination
is
made
that
the
deposit
is
primarily
for
the
purpose
of
assuring
payment
for
goods
or
services
to
be
delivered
in
the
future,
and
that
the
deposit
is
not
required
to
be
escrowed
or
otherwise
segregated
and
kept
from
the
dominion
of
the
utility
company.
the
seventh
circuit
emphasized
in
its
analysis
that
interest
was
to
be
paid
on
the
funds
here,
which
seems
to
us
not
to
distinguish
the
case
from
an
ordinary
advance
payment
in
which
there
often
is
a
discount
given
to
the
customer
for
making
the
payment
in
advance.
interest
simply
recognizes
the
time
value
of
money,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
any...
any
criterion
that
we
look
to
can
be
considered
to
be
facts
and
circumstances.
i
have
tried
to
explain
why
we
think
the
criteria
that
we
have
mentioned
are
controlling
and
make
the
situation
indistinguishable
from
an
advance
payment,
in
terms
of
either
its
economic
effect
or
its
intended
purpose.
the
facts
and
circumstances
that
are
recited
by
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
seem
to
us
to
be
demonstrably
immaterial
in
this
case.
on
many
of
the
deposits
interest
won't
even
be
paid
by
the
utility.
it
is
required
to
pay
interest
under
the
amended
regulations
only
if
it
has
held
the
deposit
for
12
months.
and
if
the
customer
has
terminated
service
before
that
time,
or
if
the
customer
has
paid
its
bills
on
time
for
nine
months,
it
is
required
under
the
public
service
commissions
rules
to
refund
the
deposit
before
the
12
months
has
elapsed.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
believe
not,
mr.
justice.
i
believe
not.
i
would
like,
if
i
may,
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
court's
trilogy
of
decisions
were
decided
by
divided
votes
in
favor
of
the
government,
five
to
three,
five
to
four
and
five
to
four.
as
i
think
much
of
the
exchange
has
illustrated,
there
was
a
substantial
and
coherent
position
expressed
in
the
dissenting
opinions
in
those
cases--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
correct.
and
those
cases
are
not
challenged
here,
and
congress
has
tinkered
with
the
results
in
sections
455
and
456
of
the
code,
and
has
adopted
other
rules
where
it
saw
fit
to
do
so
for
prepaid
subscription
income
for
newspapers
and
magazines,
and
for
dues
to
non-profit
membership
organizations,
such
as
the
auto
club.
but
otherwise
has
left
them
in
effect.
and
once
what
admittedly
was
a
coherent
position
taken
in
dissent
is
behind
us
in
those
three
cases,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
coherent
position
now
in
applying
the
implications
of
those
three
cases
to
the
utility's
situation
is
the
position
that
has
been
taken
in
the
commissioner's
revenue
ruling.
otherwise,
you
get
into
what
the
court
of
appeals
here
admitted
was
functionally
similar
situations
being
treated
differently,
such
as
getting
an
advance
payment
of
the
twelfth
month's
rent,
or
getting
a
deposit
equivalent
to
the
twelfth
months
rent
that
will
be
returned
after
twelve
months
of
rent
has
been
paid.
why...
there
is
no
possible
reason
why
those
two
situations
should
result
in
different
tax
consequences.
and
the
tax
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
by
enumerating
a
number
of
factors
to
be
looked
into,
has
invited
an
inquiry
into
whether
a
prepayment
to
secure
the
payment
of
future
income
differs
from
an
advance
payment
of
that
future
income,
when
there
really
is
no
meaningful
difference
between
the
two
inquiries.
and
it
is
hard
to
see
how
any
of
these
factors
bear
on
them.
and
that
is
not
going
to
be
a
criterion
for
even-handed
administration
of
the
tax
laws.
when
the
so-called
security
deposit
is
given
to
assure
the
payment
of
the
future
income,
it
is
a
receipt
of
that
income.
and
the
only
question
is
the
timing
of
its
recognition,
and
that
was
settled
in
this
court's
trilogy
of
cases,
that
the
commissioner
did
have
authority
to
insist
that
when
that
income
is
received
in
advance
by
the
accrual
basis
taxpayer,
he
has
to
recognize
it
at
that
time.

that
is

well,
but
the
code
does
not
give
controlling
significance
to
labels
that
are
meaningless,
either,
when
the
same
payment
is
being
made
between
two
parties
to
a
transaction
and
it
is
called
one
thing
or
another.
that,
the
code
does
not
do,
and
i
think
it
would
not
lead
to
even-handed
administration
of
the
tax
laws
for
the
decision
here
to
invite
that
approach
to
the
issue.
