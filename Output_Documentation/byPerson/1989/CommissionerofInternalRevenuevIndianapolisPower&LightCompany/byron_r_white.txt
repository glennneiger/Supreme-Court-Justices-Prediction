but
if
these
sums
were
segregated,
i
take
it
it
would
be
a
indication
that
these
funds
were
not
available
for
just
any
use
that
the
company
wanted
to
make
with...
of
them.

whereas
the
loan
proceeds,
you
borrow
money
to
use
for
the
general
corporate
purposes,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.

yeah,
but
if
the...
if
the
company
goes
broke
it
may
not
have
the
money
to
refund
these.
if
the
funds
were
segregated
in
a
separate
fund
you
wouldn't
be
using
them
for
other
purposes.
