justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
it
depend
upon
that,
mr.
wallace?
i
thought
you
were
arguing,
in
one
part
of
your
brief
at
least,
economic
reality.
and
i
don't
think
whether
it
is
escrowed
or
not
has
very
much
different...
very
much
to
do
at
all
with
the
economic
reality
of
the
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suggest
that
in
establishing
that,
they
are
not
looking
to
economic
reality,
which
is
what
you
argue
we
ought
to
look
to
for
the
rest
of
the
case,
and
not
to
intent
or
to
such...
such
other
matters.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
are
taxing
those
earnings...
you
began
your
presentation
by
saying
that
is
not
at
issue--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether...
what
happens
to
the
earnings
from
them.
all
that
is
at
issue
is
whether
when
you
get
it
it
is
income.
and
it
seems
to
me
it
makes
no
difference,
when
you
are
dealing
with
a
massive
public
utility
that
has
many
assets,
whether
it
goes
into
its
own
general
pot
or
is
put
in
escrow.
in
either
case,
it
seems
to
me,
the
company
gets
assured
the
payment
of
the
bill
that
is
going
to
be
later
presented.
the
economic
reality
between
those
two
situations
does
not
seem
to
me
distinguishable.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
could
you...
i
don't
understand
how
you
reconciled
the
commissioner's
revenue
ruling
79-229
with
what
you
are
urging
upon
us
here.
that's
discussed
by
the
respondent
at
pages
35
and
36
of
his
brief.
and
what
it
sets
for,
essentially,
is
that
the
commissioner
has
decided
that
when
a
livestock
producer
receives
a
payment,
whether
that
payment
will
be
considered
to
be
income,
and
on
the
other
side
a
deduction,
or
rather
just
a
deductible...
whether
it
be
considered
income
for
the
prepayment
of
food
for
the
cattle,
or
on
the
other
hand
a
deposit,
will
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
not
on
the
automatic
sort
of
a
rule
that
you
are
urging
here.
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
statutes...
congress
is
allowed
to
be
inconsistent.
i
just
want
to
talk
about
the
commissioner
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
understand
you,
you
are
acknowledging
it
is
inconsistent.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose...
suppose,
mr.
wallace,
that
i
establish
a
scheme,
i
am
a
marketer
of
furniture,
or
whatever,
and
i
establish
a
scheme
where
i
let
people
make
advance
payments.
but
those
advance
payments,
just
to
guarantee
them
that
they
will
get
them
back
if
i
don't
come
across
with
the
goods
later
on
when
they
are
due,
those
advance
payments
are
put
into
escrow.
would
i
have
to
report
as
income
those
advance
payments?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
i
am
not
following
this.
is
it
the...
do
you
understand
it
to
be
the
government's
position
that
if
these
funds
had
been
segregated,
although
not
escrowed,
the
tax
would
not
have
been
payable?
i
mean,
if
that
is
their
position,
you
ought
to
advise
your
client
that
way.
that
seems
to
me
that
is
a
pretty
easy
way
to
handle
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
the
government's
position,
that
all
you
had
to
do
was
segregate
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
escrowed,
just
segregated.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stroble,
are
you
sure
that
that
is
true.
it
is
true
that
with
respect
to
most
of
its
customers
the
utility
has
an
obligation
to
provide
services.
i
would
think
however,
that
when
the
state
regulating
commission
approved
this
requirement
of
an
advance
payment
for
certain
people
it
is
saying
you
don't
have
to
serve
these
people
unless
they
make
the
advance
payment.
i
mean,
isn't
that
the
deal?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
it's
general
obligation
to
serve
all
comers
is
suspended
with
respect
to
some
particularly
economically
shaky
individuals.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
fine.
but
at
that
point
you
couldn't
say
that
the
customer
was
getting
nothing
for
the
advance
payment.
he
was
getting
further
service.
the
commission,
the
utility
had
no
obligation
to
provide
any
further
service
at
that
point,
unless
he
made
the
payment.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
is
getting
something
for
the
payment,
continuing
service,
which
the
utility
would
not
otherwise
have
any
obligation
to
provide.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
to
say,
all
the
customers
from
whom
you
demand
these
prepayments.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
what
counts
what
it
is
collected
for,
and
not
at
all
what
it
is
paid
for?
do
you
look
at
just
one
side
of
that?
i...
it's
not
a
trick
question,
i
don't
know
the
answer.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
am
sure
that
he
is
paying
it
only
to
get
more
electricity.
right?
to
have
your
service
continue.
it
is
clear
from
that
side
what
he
is
doing
it
for,
right?
why
do
you
think
an
advance
payment
is
properly
treated
as
income
right
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
you
would
have
that
same
problem
if
it
were,
even
if
it
were
considered,
whether
it
is
considered
a
security
deposit
or
a
prepayment.
wouldn't
you
have
the
same
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
sorry.
i
asked
you
the
wrong
question.
suppose
it
were
concededly
a
prepayment.
you
have
no
doubt,
you
receive
it
as
a
prepayment.
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
the
same
thing
happen?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that
is
just
a
function
of
what
happens
when
you
get
a
prepayment.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
report
that
payment
until
the
services
were
provided
12
months
later?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
on
an
accrual
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
the
point
you
collected
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
don't
accrue
it
when
you,
at
the
end,
at
the
twelfth
month.
what
happens
at
the
twelfth
month
is,
if
you
do
deliver
the
services,
you
return
the
money
and
you
get
a
deduction
for
the
return
of
the
money,
which
in
effect
offsets
the
accrued
income
you
are
receiving
that
month.
it
works
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
so
the
only
real
problem
is
that
you
get
a
double
charge
the
first
month,
which
is
evened
out
at
the
end,
but
you
get
a
double
charge...
which
is
in
the
government's
advantage.
but
i
am
saying
that
always
happens
to
an
accrual...
to
an
accrual
taxpayer
whenever
you
get
an
advance
payment.
so
it
doesn't
prove
your
case.
all
it
says
is
if
it
is
an
advance
payment,
yeah,
that
ought
to
happen.
but
that
still
leaves
you
with
the
question
of
whether
it
is
an
advance
payment
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
object
to
that?
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
don't
object
to
it.
but
you
are
saying
it
is
applying
a
form
of
non-accrual
accounting
to
the
accrual
taxpayer.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
there
is
no
significant
economic
difference
between,
let's
assume
a
security
deposit
not
for
payment
of
future
rent,
but
for
not
destroying
the
property,
which
you
acknowledge
is
not
taxable
immediately.
correct?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
well,
but
there
is
really
no
economic
difference
between
that
and
between
the
tenant
buying
the
landlord
insurance
against
the
tenant's
destruction.
and
if
the
tenant
did
that,
i
assume
that
would
be
income
to
the
landlord,
wouldn't
it?
if
the
landlord
required
the
tenant
to
pay
for
an
insurance
policy
that
would
cover
any
destruction
by
the
tenant.
so,
you
know,
if
you
play
the
economic
reality
game,
all
sorts
of
things
would
be
income
that
aren't
income.
and
i...
i
am
just
not
impressed
with
the
fact
that
the
economic
realities
are
thus
and
so.
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
the
way
the
tax
code
is
played.
