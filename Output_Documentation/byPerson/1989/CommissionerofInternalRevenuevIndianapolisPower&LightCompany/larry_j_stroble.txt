mr.
larry
j.
stroble
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
since
at
least
1921
the
indianapolis
power
&
light
company
has
collected
customer
security
deposits
as
a
security
against
potential
bad
debt
losses,
and
it
has
collected
them
from
certain
of
its
customers.
these
deposits
have
always
been
treated
as
current
liabilities
to
customers
for
both
financial
regulatory
purposes
as
well
as
for
tax
purposes.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
the
rules
for
collection,
refunding
and
payment
of
interest
on
these
deposits
is
prescribed
by
the
state
public
service
commission.
the
commission
sets
the
guidelines
for
whether
they...
how
they
are
collected
and
how
they
are
to
be
treated
after
they
are
collected.
and
the
state
rule
essentially
imposes
no
limitation
on
the
liability...
on
the
utility's
use
of
the
funds.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
no,
they
could
have
been
segregated,
but
there
was
simply
no
reason
to
segregate
them.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
if...
perhaps
they
would
have
been
had
that
been
an
announced
position
in
1921,
that
they
would
be
taxed
if
they
were
not
segregated.
it
is
conceivable
that
the
parties
might
have
undertaken
to
set
up
such
an
arrangement.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
to
my
knowledge
the
company
is
continuing
to
follow
the
practice
it
always
has
and
continues
to
follow
exactly
what
the
state
public
service
commission's
regulations
prescribe.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
well,
that
does
seem--
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
--well,
that
seems
to
be
what
they
have
said
in
their
brief.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
we
have
never
seen
why
segregation
of
these
funds
should
be
an
important
distinction.
our
position
has
been
that
these
funds...
these
security
deposits
have
many
of
the
same
ear
marks
as
a
loan,
as
a
borrowing
of
money,
because
the
security
deposits
are
offset
by
an
obligation
to
refund
upon
conditions
which
essentially
lie
within
the
control
of
the
customer
from
whom
they
are
collected.
it
is
a
clear
principle
that
the
collection
or
the
receipt
of
borrowed
money
is
not
taxable
income.
and
that
is
true
even
if
the
funds
are
not
segregated
or
escrowed.
and
there
is
a
very
clear
reason
why
that
is
so.
under
our
federal
income
tax
system,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
past
cases,
there
must
be
an
increase
in
wealth,
an
accession
to
wealth,
before
income
is
properly
reportable.
that
is
just
a
fundamental
and
a
common
sense
proposition
of--
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
--it
would--
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
--well,
as
in
the
case
of
a
loan,
the
company
does
have
to
stand
ready
at
any
time
to
make
a
refund
to
a
customer
whenever
the
conditions
that
have
been
established
are
met.
the
deposits
are
collected
under
the
obligation
that
at
such
time
as
the
customer
shows
that
he
is
credit
worthy,
the
funds
have
to
be
returned
to
the
customer.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
it's...
the
indiana
public
service
commission
could
have
prescribed
such
a
rule.
i
think
the--
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
--the
company
could
have
accepted
the
funds
and
set
them
into
a
separate
bank
account.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
we
think
that
the
test
that
should
govern
is
essentially
the
tests
that
the
tax
court
and
seventh
circuit
applied:
are
the
amounts
in
question--
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
--we
think
that
the
payment
of
interest
is
one
factor
that
should
be
considered.
that
the
job
of
the
courts,
the
lower
courts
and
the
tax
court,
is
to
determine
whether
the
payment
in
issue
has
been
received
as
a
security
deposit,
so
that
it
is
securing
the
performance
of
a
customer
and
it
is
returnable
to
that
customer
at
such
time
as
the
deposit
has
served
its
purpose.
or
whether,
alternatively,
the
amount
is
an
advance
payment
for
goods
and
services,
so
that
it
has
been
received
to
buy
future
utility
services.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
justice
kennedy,
that
is
exactly
correct,
but
the
situation
in
which
it
has
to
be
returned
is
exactly
the
opposite
of
what
we
have
here.
in
the
case
of
an
advance
payment,
if
the
seller
who
has
received
the
payments
performs
his
obligations
under
the
contract,
namely
delivering
the
goods,
he
gets
to
keep
the
payments
he
has
received.
and
it
is
on
that
basis
that
there
is
clear
there
has
been
an
increase
in
wealth
that
justifies
taxation.
in
the
case
of
a
security
deposit,
if
it
is
the
customer
that
performs
the
secured
obligations,
then
the
amounts
have
to
be
returned
to
the
customer.
so
it
is--
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
--there
is
an
obligation
to--
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
--i
think
that
is
a
valid
observation,
that
there
is
a
difference
between
a
regulated
industry
and
the
private
commercial
setting
where
many
of
the
advance
payment
cases
originally
arose.
in
the
public
utility
setting,
it
is
a
state-mandated
obligation
that
the
utility
serve
the
customer.
and
the
receipt
of
the
security
deposit
is
not
the
consideration
that
triggers
that
obligation
to
return
goods
and
services.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
well,
another
reason
why
it
is
not
the
equivalent
of
an
advance
payment
is
that
it
is
subject
to
a
refund.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
well,
i
think
in
a
normal
advance
payment
situation
the
customer
would
want
to
make
certain
that
it
had
assured
what
it
was
going
to
receive
for
its
advance
payment.
there
would
typically
be
an
agreement
that
in
exchange
for
this
advance
payment
so
many
dollars
of
goods
and
services
will
be
delivered
at
a
certain
time
in
the
future.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
but
that
is
a
obligation
that
is
imposed
independent
of
the
deposit,
or
as
a
separate
obligation
that
is
not
a
countervailing
or
a
mutual
obligation
that
arises
for
the
reason
of
having
received
this
deposit.
government
once
says
that
you
have
received
the
deposit,
it
should
be
treated
as
the
equivalent
of
an
advance
payment,
that
the
deposit
should
be
treated
as
if
it
has
bought
future
goods
and
services.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
payment
in
question
is
not,
the
deposit
is
not
the
thing
which
triggers
the
obligation
to
supply
services
to
the
customer.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
well--
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
--well,
the
facts
of
the
case
as
they
were
disclosed
by
the
record
is
that
the...
this
utility,
except
very
rare
cases,
would
supply
service
to
any
customer,
would
allow
them
to
hook
up
to
the
system,
would
turn
on
the
electricity
and
sell
them
electricity.
it
was
only
at
such
time
as
that
customer
had
failed
to
pay
bills
and
had
receive
disconnection
notices
that
a
deposit
would
be
requested.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
in
most
cases
the
record
discloses
that
the
customer
who
fails
to
make
any
payment,
either
a
deposit
or
an
actual
payment
on
the
delinquent
utility
bills,
would
be
disconnected
for
failure
to
pay
the
utility
bill.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
it
is
true
that
a
customer
who
absolutely
refused
to
pay
a
deposit
could
be
disconnected
from
the
system.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
but
in
that
event...
in
that
circumstance,
i
think
we
still
have
to
ask
the
question
is
the
deposit
collected
for
the
purpose
of
buying
these
future
goods
and
services.
or
is
it
there
as
a
standby...
still
there
as
a
standby
security
device
collected
only
for
use
in
the
event
of
an
actual
default
by
that
customer?
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
i
think
you're
right.
i
mean,
i
think
the
question
is--
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
--in
the
three
cases
which
mr.
wallace
alluded
to,
the
automobile
club
of
michigan,
the
triple
a
case
and
the
schlude
case,
the
commissioner
fought
very
hard
for
the
proposition
that
there
are
circumstances
under
which
the
accrual
method
of
accounting
can
be
deviated
from.
under
the
all
events
test
of
the
accrual
method
you
would
only
recognize
income
as
the
utility
services
are
provided,
as
the
customer
is
billed,
and
at
that
point
income
would
be
recorded
on
the
books,
even
though
payment,
cash
payment,
had
not
actually
been
received.
those
cases
held
that,
at
least
in
certain
circumstances,
it
is
appropriate
to
tax
a
party
upon
the
receipt
of
prepayments
for
those
goods
and
services.
it
is
in
that
situation
that
the
government
is
permitted
to
deviate
from
the
normal
accrual
method
that
otherwise
governs
taxability.
the
reason
is
that
in
that
situation
the
amounts
in
question
are
identifiable,
or
are
identified
with
the
future
delivery
of
goods
and
services.
as
long
as
the
seller
provides
those
goods
and
services
he
gets
to
keep
the
money.
he
is
not
under
an
obligation
to
refund
the
money.
and
for
that
reason
the
increase
in
wealth
has
occurred.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
if
he
doesn't
furnish...
if
he
doesn't
live
up
to
his
contract,
then
he
has
to
return
the,
he
has
to
return
the
deposit.
but
as
long
as
he
lives
up
to
his
contract--
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
--yes,
that...
that's
correct.
our
position
is
that
the
distinction
there
is
that
in
the
case
of
a
customer
security
deposit,
if
the
customer
performs
as
agreed,
then
the
deposit
does
have
to
be
refunded.
in
other
words,
if
each
side
performs
their
mutual
obligations,
the
deposit
is
refunded
to
the
customer.
and
that
is
just
the
exact
opposite
of
an
advance
payment,
where
the
performance
of
each
party's
mutual
obligations
results
in
the
seller
being
entitled
to
retain
the
payment.
the
commissioner's
approach
produces
a
serious
problem
that
needs
to
be
addressed,
and
it
relates
to
this
question
of
proper
tax
treatment
of
an
accrual
method
taxpayer.
as
we
just
noted,
an
accrual
method
taxpayer
reports
income
as
the
goods
and
services
are
delivered
and
billed
for,
and
at
that
point
income
is
put
on
the
books
for
tax
purposes.
in
the
taxpayers
case,
in
this
utility's
case,
income
was
recognized
as
the
utility
meter
was
read
and
as
the
customer
was
billed.
so
as
soon
as
the
income
was
recognized
an
account
receivable
was
then
put
on
the
books.
the
advance
payment
rule
says
that
depending
on
the
facts,
a
prepayment
of
cash
can
be
taxed
at
the
time
it
is
received,
even
though,
under
the
normal
accrual
method,
recognition
of
income
would
be
deferred
until
the
goods
are
actually
delivered.
this
was
the
holding
of
the
three
trilogy,
so-called
trilogy
cases,
of
the
late
'50s
and
early
'60s.
but
what
the
commissioner
is
doing
here
is
taking
what
was
an
exception
to
the
all
events
test,
the
prepayment
rule,
and
basically
applying
that
in
tandem
with
the
accrual
method.
the
result
is
a
distortion
of
income,
or
a
double
counting
of
income,
essentially
along
the
lines
that
justice
kennedy
alluded
to
in
mr.
wallace's
presentation.
he
is
basically
applying
a
cash
method
to
the
deposit,
and
an
accrual
method
to
the
goods
and
services,
simultaneously.
it
is
being
imposed
simultaneously
on
the
same
series
of
transactions.
because
what
happens
is
the
deposit
is
included
in
income
when
collected,
and
the
utility,
under
its
normal
accrual
method
of
accounting,
is
also
required
to
report
income
as
it
delivers
services
to
its
customers.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
well,
i
think
there
is
a
difference,
and
perhaps
an
example
might
help
me
better
illustrate
it.
let
us
take
the
example
of
a
taxpayer
that
collects
a
security
deposit,
such
as
we
have
here.
we'll
say
it's
a
$25
security
deposit.
so
it
is
collected
in
year
one.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
yeah.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
i
don't
think
so,
because
what
happens
in
that
case
is
the
utility
receives
a
prepayment
for
a
given
utility
service,
it
would
have
no
reason
to
send
out
a
bill
to
that
customer
or
to
accrue
any
additional
income,
because
it
has
already
received
the
payment,
with
those
identifiable
goods
and
services.
in
other
words,
if
a
customer
says
this
is
a
prepayment
for
goods
and
services,
i
would
not
then
separately
bill
that
customer
for
those
services,
and
i
wouldn't
accrue
any
additional
income.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
well,
if
it
was
a
true
prepayment,
as
you
has
posited
in
your
example--
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
--and
i'm
on
the
accrual
basis,
under
the
trilogy
cases
i
would
report
that
as
income
at
the
point
i
collected
it,
no
question.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
but
i
would
not
then
again
accrue
income
as
i
delivered
those
services
to
that
customer.
that's,
i
think,
the
problem
that
is
developing
in
this
case,
is--
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
--that
seems
to
solve
the
problem
as
long
as
we
contain
everything
within
a
given
taxable
year.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
if
it
is
an
advance
payment,
then
it
would
normally
be
identifiable
with
some
goods
and
service
that
would
permit
the
taxpayer
to
avoid
that
second,
that
accrual,
that
separate
accrual
and
the
double
counting
that
would
occur
in
the
first
year.
if
it
is
not
an
advance--
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
--exactly.
the
government
is
picking
up,
in
the
one
example,
13
months
in
a
12-month
period,
or
in
my
example,
the
government
is
accruing,
basically
double
counting
the
income
for
a
given
period
of
service.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
it
seems
that
an
advance
payment
has
to
be
designated
to
some
particular
identifiable
good
or
service.
i
mean,
i
think
that
is
part
of
the
problem
from
the
accounting
standpoint,
and
ultimately
this
is
a
question
of
whether
the
utility's
income
is
being
clearly
reflected.
an
advance
payment
would
be
something
that
you
could
identify
with
a
good
or
service
to
be
delivered
in
the
future.
but
a
deposit
is
not
intended
to
be
a
prepayment.
it
is
intended
to
sort
of
stand
by
as
a
security
device.
consequently,
we
have
no
way
of
identifying
it
with
some
future
periods
utility
service
when
it
is
collected.
and
for
that
reason
the
normal
accrual
accounting
rules
apply
in
accounting
for
our
utility
service
delivery
in
the
future.
that
strikes
us
as
really
an
over
reaching,
really
getting
the
best
of
both
worlds.
the
best
of
the
cash
method
and
the
best
of
the
accrual
method,
overlaid
on
top
of
one
another,
and
a
distortion
of
the
taxpayer's
income,
which
is
directly
contrary
to
the
advance
payment
rules
that...
and
to
the
security
deposit
rules,
which
ultimately
govern
this
case.
this
other
area
that
we
see
the
commissioner
over
reaching
in,
essentially
trying
to
take
an
advantage
that
is
not
a
fair
advantage,
is
to
criticize
the
facts
and
circumstances
test,
which
the
tax
court
and
the
seventh
circuit
utilized
here,
as
being
too
vague.
and
then,
when
addressing
the
treatment
of
the
person
who
pays
a
deposit,
providing
that
a
facts
and
circumstances
analysis
is
the
only
way
to
determine
a
proper
tax
treatment.
as
justice
scalia
mentioned
in
revenue
ruling
79-229
dealing
with
a
cash-basis
farmer,
the
question
is
whether
a
given
amount
is
a
deductible
advance
payment
or,
on
the
other
hand,
is
it
a
non-deductible
deposit.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
it
deals
with
the
question
whether
a
cash-basis
taxpayer
should
be--
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
--i
think
it
does
in
an
environment
where
we
say
we
are
going
to
make
an
exception
to
the
normal
accrual
method
and
tax
the
receipt
of
the
cash
as
a
prepayment,
if
it
really
is
a
prepayment.
so
in
that
sense
the
commissioner
is
using
a
form
of
cash
method
when
he
tries
to
accelerate
the
taxation
at
a
point
earlier
than
it
normally
would
be
recognized
under
an
accrual
method.
so
i
think
in
that
sense
the
treatment
of
a
cash--
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
--if
it
is
a
true
advance
payment,
we
wouldn't
object
to
it.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
it
is.
and
the
treatment
of
a
cash
basis
deposit
payor,
or
deposit
payee,
has
relevance.
the
real
question
is,
in
that
revenue
ruling,
is
this
particular
sum
a
deposit
or
is
it
an
advance
payment?
and
the
ruling
states
that
whether
a
particular
expenditure
is
a
deposit
or
a
payment
depends
on
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
case,
which
is
exactly
what
the
tax
court
and
the
seventh
circuit
said
here.
and
the
ruling
goes
on
to
say
that
when
it
can
be
shown
that
the
expenditure
is
not
refundable,
and
is
made
pursuant
to
an
enforceable
sales
contract,
then
in
that
case
it
will
not
be
considered
a
deposit.
so
those
are
the
very
points
that
we
think
are
important
in
trying
to
evaluate
the
taxability
of
the
person
that
receives
the
deposit.
mr.
larry
j.
stroble
in,
it
enumerates
four
or
five
factors
that
are
to
be
looked
at,
and
clearly
the
question
of
whether
it
is
refundable
and
whether
or
not
it
is
part
of
an
enforceable
sales
contract
for
specific
goods
and
services
are
key
factors
in
making
that
determination.
i
think
the
commissioner
would
allow
a
consideration
of
the
overall
set
of
circumstances
to
try
to
arrive
at
that
decision,
but
clearly,
the
refundability
becomes
a
key
point.
we
think
that
really
it
shouldn't
make
any
difference
which
side
of
the
coin
you
are
looking
at,
as
long
as
the
issue
is
does
the
deposit
serve
as
a
true
security
deposit
or
does
it
serve
as
a...
an
advance
payment
for
goods
and
services.
the
approach
used
by
the
seventh...
by
the
tax
court
and
the
seventh
circuit
are
faithful
to
the
general
principle
recognized
by
this
court,
that
it
is
only
amounts
which
really
produce
some
form
of
increase
in
wealth
which
should
be
taxable,
and
that
as
long
as
the
amount
is
offset
by
an
obligation
to
refund,
that
increase
in
wealth
has
not
occurred.
and
it
is
only
a
review
of
the
total
relationship
between
the
parties
that
a
fair
evaluation
can
be
made
of
whether
there
has
been
a
sufficient
transfer
of
rights
to
justify
taxation.
the
commissioner's
approach
is
essentially
an
arbitrary
per
se
rule
that
disregards
the
most
critical
facts
to
be
considered
in
making
that
determination.
the
result
of
using
the
commissioner's
approach
is
to
distort
income,
to
mischaracterize
and
misaccount
for
the
actual
earning
of
income,
which
should
be
the
purpose
of
good
tax
accounting.
for
those
reasons
we
believe
that
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
unanimous
tax
court
properly
evaluated
the
facts
before
it,
and
concluded
that
these
were
true
security
deposits,
and
not
some
form
of
disguised
advanced
payment.
unless
there
are
any
questions--
