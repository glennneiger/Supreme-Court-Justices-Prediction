we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-1319,
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
versus
indianapolis
power
&
light
company.
mr.
wallace,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
wouldn't
treat...
you
wouldn't
treat
the
purchaser
differently
if
it
were
a
utility
company
as
opposed
to
a
livestock
dealer.
you
would
apply
the
same
standards
to
them,
wouldn't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
the
seventh
circuit,
as
i
understand
it,
took
the
position
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
each
case,
and
they
upheld
the
determination
of
the
tax
court.
now,
your
complaint
with
that
is
that
they
should
have
followed
a
flat
rule
of
some
sort?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you...
does
your
rule
give
one
uniform
result
for
all
deposits
required
by
utility
companies
from
customers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
there
some
one
factor...
factor
in
your
analysis
that
is
controlling,
so
that
you
could
say
it
wasn't
a
facts
and
circumstances
test,
or
is
it
just
you
think
there
should
have
been
different
facts
and
circumstances
considered,
or
perhaps
a
different
result
reached
on
the
same
facts
and
circumstances?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
please
proceed,
mr.
stroble.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
stroble.
mr.
wallace,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
blackmun.
