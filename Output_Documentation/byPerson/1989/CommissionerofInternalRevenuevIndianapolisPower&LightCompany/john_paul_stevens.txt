justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stroble,
although
mr.
wallace
didn't
make
the
point,
doesn't
that
case,
or
that
ruling
deal
with
cash-basis
taxpayers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
does
it
have
any
bearing
on
how
we
treat
accrual-basis
taxpayers
who
get
income
up
front?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
does
the
ruling
say
the
converse?
that
if
it
is
refundable
it
will
be
treated
as--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
can
i
interrupt
you
just
a
second
on
those
three
cases?
it
seems
to
me
that
if
those,
if
you
had
lost
those
three
cases
a
fortiori
you
would
lose
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
isn't
it
true
that
those
cases
basically
said
that
we
will
make
an
exception
from
normal
accrual
accounting
procedures
for
payments
received
in
advance,
as
in
those
cases.
so
what
we
have
here
is
whether--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--we
construe
an
exception
broadly
or
narrowly.
