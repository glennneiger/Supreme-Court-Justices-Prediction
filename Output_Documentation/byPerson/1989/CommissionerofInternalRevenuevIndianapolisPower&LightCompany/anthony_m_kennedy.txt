justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
your
position
is
that
the
deposits
here
should
be
treated
as
advance
payments,
i
take
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
problem
i
have
with
that,
or
maybe
it
isn't
a
problem...
you
tell
me
if
i
am
wrong.
if
you
have
a
12-month
cycle
and
you
get
an
advance
payment
for
the
12
months,
then
the
utility,
over
the
period
of
12
months,
recognizes
12
months
of
income,
right?
it
doesn't
recognize
income
in
december,
it
recognizes
two
months
of
income
in
january.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
but
under
your
view,
under
the
security
deposit,
you
would
recognize
13
months
of
income,
because
you
have
to
accrue
each
month.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
is
getting
more
under
the
security
deposit
theory
than
it
would
under
the
advance
payment
theory.
so
you
have
bettered
yourself.
or
is
that
wrong?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
an
advance
payment
is
attributable
to
a
month.
and
so
for
the
month
that
it
applies,
you
don't
accrue
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
are
getting
an
extra
month.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
at
the
very
end
of
the
cycle...
at
the
very
end
of
the
cycle
it
works
out,
although,
of
course,
at
that
point
the
utility
now
has
a
new
customer
and
it
starts
all
over
again.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
an
advance
payment
has
to
be
returned
if
the
service
isn't
rendered.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
the
reality
of
the
utility
business
is
that
you
can't
pick
and
choose
your
customer.
you
could...
you
could
never
elect
that
you
just
didn't
want
to
serve
that
customer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
that
differs,
makes
a
substantial
difference
between
the
security
deposit
in
this
industry
and
the
security
deposit
in,
say,
a
furniture
business
where
you
might
decide
that
you
are
just
not
going
to
deliver.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
from
a
practical
standpoint,
it
really
is
just
an
advance
payment,
isn't
it?
other
than
the
interest
factor.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
is
the
advance
payment
if
the
customer
elects
to
terminate
the
service.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but,
as
we
have
already
established,
a
utility
always
has
to
deliver
services.
it
can't
unilaterally
discontinue
service,
absent
nonpayment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
he
is
under
an
obligation
if
he
doesn't
furnish
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
nevertheless,
meanwhile
he
has
returned
it
as
ordinary
income.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
whereas
a
security
deposit
is
carried
on
indefinitely
and
might
not
relate
to
the
first
year,
so
the
government
tends
to
maximize
income
to
a
greater
extent
under
security
deposits
than
with
advance
payments.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
i
guess
the
government
could
argue
it's
the
way
we
structure
the
hypothetical,
it's
the
way
we
are
assuming
the
advance
payment
is
designated.
we
are
assuming
it
is
designated
for
the
twelfth
month.
