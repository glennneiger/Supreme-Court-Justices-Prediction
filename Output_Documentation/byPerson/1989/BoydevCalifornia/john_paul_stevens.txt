justice
stevens
but
they
only
relate
to
matters
that
extenuate
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
not
the,
reflect
the
character
of
the
individual
who
committed
the
crime.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
how
does
the
fact
that
he
had
a
bad
childhood
extenuate
the
gravity
of
the
crime?
it
is
still
a
murder
in
exactly
the
same
facts
as
if
none
of
that
had
happened.
justice
stevens
that's
right.
justice
stevens
that
is
precisely
the
point.
justice
stevens
the
test
is
whether
this
evidence
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
justice
stevens
and
i
don't
see
how
any
of
it
does.
justice
stevens
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
you
about
the
prosecutor's
argument
in
the
other
case
that
your
opponent
referred
to,
and
i
understand
that
we
have
to
deal
with
this
case,
but
that
prosecutor
must
in
good
faith
have
misread
this
instruction,
wouldn't
you
say?
he
apparently
understood
the
law
to
be
as
he
described
it
to
his
jury.
i
don't
assume
he
acted
in
bad
faith.
justice
stevens
no,
but
we're
only
trying
to
decide
whether
reasonable
people
might
read
this
language
in
a
particular
way.
and
i
suggest
to
you
that
in
another
case
a
well-trained
prosecutor
read
it
in
this
way,
presumed
he
is
literate
and
acting
in
good
faith.
why
can't
we
assume
jurors
would
read
it
the
same
way
that
prosecutor
did?
justice
stevens
well,
just
even
if
we
had
one.
at
least
one
prosecutor,
you
would
agree,
has
read
it
the
way
your
opponent
says
the
jury
might
read
it.
justice
stevens
wouldn't
you
agree
with
that?
justice
stevens
wouldn't
you
agree
with
that?
justice
stevens
or
do
you
think
he
was
acting
in
bad
faith?
justice
stevens
but
don't
you
suppose
he
did
so
because
that
is
the
way
he
read
the
instruction?
justice
stevens
well,
normally
we
presume
that
lawyers
act
in
good
faith,
at
least
i
do,
and
i
assume
he
was
acting
in
the
best
of
faith.
he
just
thought
that
is
what
this
language
meant.
justice
stevens
no,
but
they
all,
they
read
the
same
language
he
read.
and
i
am
saying
it
must
be
a
reasonable
reading
if
a
trained
prosecutor
read
it
that
way.
that
is
the
only
point
i
am
making.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask
in
this
argument,
mr.
millar,
is
it
your
position
that
the
outweigh
"shall"
instruction
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
an
instruction
that
says,
if
after
listening
to
all
the
evidence
you
think
death
is
the
appropriate
penalty,
you
shall
enter
it?
or
do
you
say
it
is
something
different,
that
it
is
all
right
to
tell
the
jury
that
outweighing
is
enough,
even
if
you
don't
think
that
death
is
the
appropriate
penalty?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
well,
if--
justice
stevens
--if,
if
that
is
your
position,
what
do
you
have
to
say
about
the
amicus
brief
that
points
out
that
in
oakland
there
were
some
15
cases,
and
about
half
of
those,
i
guess
eight
of
them,
the
jury
found
that
the
factor,
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
did
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances,
but
nevertheless,
death
was
not
the
appropriate
penalty.
justice
stevens
well,
don't--
justice
stevens
--right.
justice
stevens
but
don't
those
cases
demonstrate
that
at
least
in
those
eight
cases
juries
concluded
one,
that
aggravating
circumstances
outweighed
mitigating
circumstances,
and
two,
that
nevertheless,
death
was
not
the
appropriate
penalty?
justice
stevens
well,
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
they
were
doing
anything
different
there
than
they
were
doing
in
the
case
before
us?
justice
stevens
but
couldn't
one
also
at
least
speculate
that
under
the
one-step
process,
one
cannot
be
sure
that
the
jury
did
make
the
moral
judgment
that
you
assume
they
did.
now,
is
your
argument,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
is
that
we
should
assume
that
the,
if
the
jury
thought
the
aggravating
factors
outweighed
the
mitigating
factors,
it
also
thought
that
death
was
the
appropriate
penalty.
i
think
that
is
your,
that
is
basically
what
you
are
saying.
so
that
it
gives
them
appropriate
discretion.
but
is
it
not
possible,
at
least,
that
they
might
have
thought
one
outweighed
the
other,
but
still
not
by
enough
to
justify
the
death
penalty?
justice
stevens
well,
where
were
they
not
told
that?
i
don't
understand
that.
because
i
thought
the
outweigh
shall
instruction
is
kind
of
the
end
of,
the
last
thing
they
are
told.
because
they...
the
difference
between
your
system
and
the
alameda
county
one
was
they
are
told
that,
and
then
it
is
said,
furthermore,
if
you
think
death
is
the
appropriate
penalty,
then
go
ahead
and
impose
the
death
penalty.
but
they
never
had,
did
have
such
an
instruction
here.
justice
stevens
that
that
is
implicit
in
the
weighing
process.
