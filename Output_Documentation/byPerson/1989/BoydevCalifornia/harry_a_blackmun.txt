justice
blackmun
or
to
put
it
another
way,
you
are
saying
that
even
though
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh
mitigating
circumstances,
there
still
should
be
a
window
where
the
jury
could
say
death
is
not
the
appropriate
penalty.
justice
blackmun
that's
a
pretty
mandatory
word,
isn't
it?
justice
blackmun
to
mean
"may".
justice
blackmun
well,
that
has
to
be
your
argument,
of
course,
but
certainly
the
statute
could
be
better
drawn,
couldn't
it?
justice
blackmun
at
least
the
situation
has
been
ameliorated
since
this
case,
hasn't
it?
justice
blackmun
clarified
or
improved?
justice
blackmun
but
it
is
important
when
a
man's
life
is
in
danger,
isn't
it?
justice
blackmun
i
say
it
is
important
when
a
man's
life
is
at
issue,
isn't
it?
justice
blackmun
--somewhere
in
your
argument
you
are
going
to
touch
upon
the
prosecutor's
behavior
at
voir
dire?
justice
blackmun
well,
that
has
to
be
your
position,
of
course,
but
i
guess
i
don't
whitewash
it
as
easily
as
you
do.
justice
blackmun
of
course
your
california
supreme
court
split
four
to
three
on
this,
didn't
it?
justice
blackmun
well,
they
split
also
on
the
voir
dire
propriety
remarks,
didn't
they?
justice
blackmun
four
to
three.
justice
blackmun
don't
misunderstand
me.
i...
it
may
well
be
that
if
this
case
were
reversed,
and
a
new
trial
came
along,
or
a
new
penalty
phase
anyway,
he
probably
would
get
the
death
penalty
again,
or
possibly
could.
but,
that
is
not
our
issue
here.
