chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-6613,
richard
boyde
versus
california.
we'll
wait
just
a
moment,
mr.
fischer.
very
well,
mr.
fischer,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
referring
now
to
the
so-called
factor
(k)
instruction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
see
why
the
jury
couldn't
consider
that.
i
mean,
extenuate
typically
means
lessen
or
excuse.
why
wouldn't
that
evidence
be
thought
by
the
jury
to
lessen
or
excuse
the
gravity
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
rehnquist
give
me
some
of
them.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
was
the
change
they
made?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
the
fact
that
the
instruction
might
have
been
improved
upon,
may
have
been
more
precise,
surely
isn't
controlling.
the
question
is
was
this
likely
to
prevent
the
jury
from
considering
the
sort
of
evidence
you
mention.
and
i
must
say
i
don't,
i
am
not
persuaded...
i
speak
only
for
myself...
by
what
you
have
said
so
far.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
says
and
any
other
circumstance.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we'll
resume
there
at
one
o'clock.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
fischer,
you
may
continue.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fischer.
mr.
millar,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
millar,
does
alameda
county
have
some
sort
of
home
rule
under
the
death
penalty
statute?
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
case
came
from
riverside
county?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
millar.
mr.
fischer,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fischer.
the
case
is
submitted.
