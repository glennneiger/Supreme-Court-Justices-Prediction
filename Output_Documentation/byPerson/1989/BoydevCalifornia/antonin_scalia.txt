justice
scalia
mr.
fischer,
let
me
ask
you,
i
agree
that
that,
that
example
is
quite
clearly
an
argument
that
it
simply
can't
be
used
under
the
gravity
factor,
quite
simply
and
plainly.
but
that
is
not
this
case.
now,
in
order
to
uphold
the
law,
you
are
talking,
we
are
talking
about
the
california
statute,
which
you
are
asking
us
to
strike
down
in
its
entirety
with
respect
to
all
cases.
that
is
what
you
want.
justice
scalia
you
want
factor
(k)
out.
justice
scalia
must
we
establish
that
it
does,
it
cannot
be
misdescribed
in
any
case,
or
that
it
does
not
lend
itself
to
misdescription
in
any
case?
justice
scalia
let's
take
every
case
before
that.
justice
scalia
in
the
particular
case.
justice
scalia
right.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
simply
because
you
are
using
a
factor
(k)
instruction
it
is
going
to
be
always
bad.
in
which
case,
calling
attention
to
this
other
case,
does
not
do
your
particular
case
any
good.
justice
scalia
i
don't
see
what
it
proves,
the
empirical
study.
that...
you
haven't
explained
that
to
me.
it
still
seems
to
me
that
by
giving
all
these
other
examples
you...
it
is
sort
of
like
error
by
association.
because
a
prosecutor
in
another
trial
described
the
factor
(k)
patently
wrong,
therefore
the
prosecutor
in
this
trial
described
it
patently
wrong?
i
don't
see
how
that
follows.
justice
scalia
well,
fine,
we
can
talk
about
this
trial,
and--
justice
scalia
--and
this
language,
but
i
don't
see
how
that
is
helped
by--
justice
scalia
--by
saying
that
another
prosecutor
misdescribed
it
in
another
trial.
justice
scalia
the
prosecutor
might
have
had
an
incentive
to
misunderstand
the
meaning
of
the
instruction
as
well.
correct?
i
mean,
he
misunderstood
it
in
his
favor.
