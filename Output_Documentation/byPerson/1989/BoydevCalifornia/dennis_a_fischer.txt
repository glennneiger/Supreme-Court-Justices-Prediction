mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
two
issues
of
constitutional
dimension
concerning
two
aspects
of
california's
1978
death
penalty
initiative,
which
have
since
been
corrected
in
measures
adopted
by
the
committee
that
controls
the
giving
of
instructions
in
state
trial
courts
throughout
california
in
1983
and
1985,
respectively,
following
decisions
by
the
california
supreme
court
disapproving
of
those
instructions.
petitioner
richard
boyde
was
found
guilty
by
a
riverside
superior
court
jury
of
murder
with
two
special
circumstance
allegations
being
found
true.
because
the
prosecutor
had
announced
his
intention
to
seek
the
death
penalty
before
trial
commenced
and
the
jury
was
examined
and
death
qualified,
the
trial
proceeded
into
a
penalty
phase
that,
before
the
same
jurors,
that
was
directed
and
governed
by
the
statutory
provisions
at
issue
in
this
case.
the
prosecutor
presented
evidence
in
aggravation
that
covered
and
tracked
factors
a,
b
and
c
of
the
eleven
factors
listed
in
penal
code
section
190.3,
and
set
forth
in
the
jury
instruction
that
is
before
the
court
in
this
case,
concerning
both
the
crime
itself,
prior
felony
convictions
on
the
part
of
the
defendant,
and
past
activity
of
a...
criminal
activity
of
a
forcible
or
violent
nature.
some
of
the
evidence
that
he
presented,
the
california
supreme
court
subsequently
determined
had
been
improperly
presented,
because
it
did
not
relate
to
the
statutory
aggravating
factors.
the
defense
then
began
its
case,
and
presented
testimony
from
richard
boyde's
mother,
from
two
of
his
sisters,
his
stepfather,
his
wife,
brenda
dickson
green,
his
former
girlfriend
and
mother
of
his
child,
and
mrs.
dickson,
mrs.
green's
mother.
together,
they
presented
a
wide
variety
of
evidence
about
the
character
and
background
of
richard
boyde
that
was
not
immediately
related
to
the
circumstances
of
the
underlying
crime,
but
did
provide
a
basis
for
the
jury,
in
justice
powell's
words
in
mccleskey
versus
kemp,
to
decline
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
petitioner's
evidence,
in
fact,
was
remarkable
in
its
comparison
and
similarity
to
cases
previously
before
this
court,
beginning
with
lockett
and
evans,
and
eddings,
and
that,
and
the...
in
showing
that
this
defendant
did
not
deserve
to
be
sentenced
to
death,
a
point,
indeed,
that
has
not
been
questioned
in
respondent's
submission
to
this
court.
that
evidence
consisted
of
the
following
aspects.
first,
his
impoverished
childhood
and
difficult
upbringing,
including
the
fact
that
he
had
been
fatherless
and
was
obsessed
with
that
fact,
and
obsessed
with
his
father's
abandonment.
this
is
evidence
very
close
to
that
recognized
in
hitchcock
versus
dugger,
as
being
appropriate
evidence
to
bring
before
the
jury
on
the
question
of
whether
the
defendant
deserved
the
death
penalty.
his
considerable
health
problems
as
a
child,
and
his
psychological
difficulties
that
affected
his
performance
at
school,
and
which
the
family
attempted
unsuccessfully
to
obtain
counseling
assistance
for,
but
was
unable
to
do
so.
besides
hitchcock,
this
factor
is
recognized
in
mills
versus
maryland's
footnote
1,
and
is
similar
to
other
cases
as
well.
third,
his
fondness
and
affection
toward
children,
his
kindness
to
family
members.
justice
o'connor
has
spoken,
in
franklin
versus
lynaugh,
in
a
concurrence
in
observing
that
evidence
of
kindness
to
others
might
demonstrate
positive
character
traits
that
might
mitigate
against
the
death
penalty.
fourth,
his
sisters'
testimony
that
he
liked
dancing,
that
he
wanted
to
pursue
it
as
a
career,
but
that
his
stepfather,
being
a
stern
gentleman,
trying
to
do
his
best,
but
frowned
on
it
and
discouraged
young
richard
from
pursuing
it.
and
that
testimony
was
followed
by
mrs.
green's
testimony
that
when
richard
was
incarcerated
that
he
won
a
prize
for
his
dance
choreography
while
he
was
in
custody.
as
in
skipper
versus
south
carolina,
this
certainly
is
a
showing
that
the
defendant
could
lead
a
useful
life,
at
least
behind
bars.
and
finally,
his
futile
attempts
to
find
employment
after
his
release,
attempts
that
he
conducted
in
earnest,
but
was
unsuccessful
because
of
his
record.
although
these
factors
are
basic
to
the
concern
of
individualized
sentencing,
which
this
court
explicated
in
woodings
versus
north
carolina,
many
subsequent
cases,
petitioner's
jury
could
not
give
effect
to
them,
because
this
evidence
was
nowhere
on
the
list
of
eleven
factors
set
forth
in
penal
code
section
190.3,
and
guided
by
the
jury
instructions
which
the
jury
was
directed
to
consider
and
give
effect
to
as
the
basis
for
its
determination
of
whether
the
defendant
should
receive
death
or
life
imprisonment
without
parole.
the,
as--
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
--the
factor
(k)
instruction,
the
instruction
which
directed
the
jury
to
crime
related
circumstances
that
extenuated
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
such
as
the
seriousness--
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
--well,
there
are
a
number
of
reasons
why
it
wouldn't,
beginning--
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
--surely.
beginning
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
which
has
eleven
factors,
all
but
two
of
which
are
crime
specific.
so
the
jury,
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
listening
to
the,
as
an
aggravating
factor
b,
the
prior
felony
convictions
or
the
c,
the
prior
criminal
activity,
very
clearly
prior
or
other
activity,
was
then
being
told
in
all
the
remaining
factors,
except,
even
including
age,
by
the
way,
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
at
the
time
of
commission
of
the
offense,
at
the
time
of
the
homicidal
act.
a
jury,
given
this
language,
at
least
explicitly,
would,
might
well
conclude,
and
certainly
its
members,
just
from
the
language
alone,
without
anything
further,
that
it,
that
related
to
the
crime
meant
extenuating
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
and
not
extenuating
the
reasons
why
the
defendant
should
not
die.
and
in
fact
you
will
notice
that
the
caljic
committee,
the
california
judges
and
distinguished
attorneys
who
create
the
instructions
and
followed
this
up,
as
we
have
set
forth
in
the
appendix
and
also
appears
in
our
amicus
brief,
use
language
very
different
to
portray...
in
effect
saying
any
other
reason
that
would
favorably
bear
on
the
decision.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
yes,
in
1983.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
i
understand.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
well,
there
are
definitely
other
circumstances,
and
i
think
the
most
telling
aspect
of
this
case
is
what
we
find
in
the
record,
taken
from
the
prosecutor's
argument.
there
is...
it
has
been
recognized
as
recently
as
last
term's
decision
in
penry
versus
lynaugh...
that
it
is
appropriate
to
look
at
the
arguments
of
the
prosecutor
in
determining
whether
the
jury
may
have
been
mislead
by
the
instructions.
and
if
we
look
at
what
the
prosecutor
said,
we
find
a
most
revealing
record,
beginning...
which
of
course
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
california
supreme
court,
speaking
for
the
three,
for
the
three
justices
in
the
dissent
in
boyde--
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
--very
well.

[recess.]
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
thank
you.
in
discussing
the
question
of
the
factor
(k)'s
effect
on
the
jury,
i
have
already
mentioned
the
specific
language
of
limitation
of
the
factor
and
its
context
in
comparison
with
others
on
the
list.
justice
rehnquist
has
raised
the
question,
however,
of
whether
the
jury
might
have
been
expected
to
understand
that,
notwithstanding
those
factors,
that
circumstances
extenuating
the
gravity
of
the
crime
might
also
reach
beyond
the
crime
to
character
and
background.
and
my
answer
is
most
tellingly,
i
think,
taken
from
the
prosecutor's
argument
on
those
issues,
on
that
issue.
the
district
attorney
started
out
in
his
opening
argument
to
the
jury
with
a
list
on
the
board,
and
it
must
have
been
a
very
graphic.
he
went
up
to
the
list,
he
had
the
factors
numbered,
he
pointed
them
out
to
the
jury,
he
had
the
jury
read
the
list
on
the
board,
and
then,
from
that,
he
went
down
them
one
by
one,
individually
reading
them
and
counting
up
whether
they
were
aggravating
or
mitigating.
he
ended
up
by,
in
his
summation
of,
in
his
beginning
argument,
by
saying
ten
solid
factors
in
aggravation.
then
he
went
through
the
petitioner's
evidence.
he
used
words
to
characterize
it
as
a
rationalization,
as
speculation.
he
asked
rhetorically
whether
any
of
them
made
the
crime
less
serious.
he
then
jumped
to
the
next
aspect
of
the
instruction,
which
told
the
jury
that
in
making
their
determination
they
have
taken
an
oath
to
follow
the
law,
and
asked
them
to
go
through
each
and
every
one
of
those
factors
and
be
guided
by
them
in
making
that
determination.
after
the
defense
completed
the
opening
argument,
the
prosecutor
returned
to
the
stand.
among
the
things
that
he
talked
about
was
that,
and
he
used
the
term
sympathy
was
to
be
filtered
out
under
the
instructions
and
is
not
a
basis
for
anyone.
he
then
defined
sympathy
as
being
underpowered,
not
knowing
who
his
father
was,
having
a
poor
childhood,
some
of
the
very
factors
that
we
have
talked
about
as,
that
this
court
has
recognized
as
mitigating
factors
of
character
and
background
that
come,
are
derived
from
the
lockett
line
of
cases.
he
also
stated
that
rehabilitation
is
not
one
of
the
factors
up
on
that
board,
and
is
not
a
basis
to
make
a
decision
like
this,
in
seeming
contradiction
to
skipper,
and
the
suggestion
that
one's
usefulness
in
prison
is
a
factor
for
the
jury
to
consider.
then
he
said
well,
there
is
always
the
concern
of
losing
someone
of
value.
well,
i
don't
put
much
stock
in
that
argument,
he
said,
again,
it
is
not
on
the
list...
all
of
this,
pages
4819,
4820,
4821
of
the
record...
in
which
he
made
these
statements.
you
can't
base
it
upon
any
kind
of
rational
guidance.
the
deterrent
value
of
the
death
penalty,
he
added,
is
not
the
basis
for
the
decision.
so,
the
prosecutor's
own
language
suggested
to
the
jury
that
if
there
was
any
question
in
their
mind,
that
they
were
precluded
from
giving
effect
to
this
information.
now,
practitioners
in
california,
during
that
time
and
during
the
time
before
the
easley
case,
clarified
that
this
procedure
should
be
abandoned,
that
this
language
was
too
narrow,
were
well
aware
of
this
language,
and
used
it
in
their
own
practice.
indeed,
prosecutors,
defense
counsel,
and
even
trial
judges
made
statements
of
this
very
kind
in
records
that
are
available
to
us.
and
we
have,
with
the
assistance
of
amicus
curiae
california
appellate
project,
some
actual
examples
of
record,
a
significant
number
of
them,
in
which
this
very,
this
very
thing
played
out.
consider
just
as
one
example,
on
page
13
of
the
cap
amicus
brief,
the
reference
to
the
case
of
people
versus
payton,
where
the
prosecutor
argued
the
defendant's
newborn
christianity,
urged
that
there
is
no
way
that,
under
any
other
circumstance
which
extenuates
or
lessens
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
that
what
i
am
getting
at
you
have
not
heard
during
the
past
few
days
any
legal
evidence
of
mitigation.
i
passed
over
the
language
i
wanted
too
quickly.
let
me
repeat
it.
seems
to
refer
to
a
fact
in
operation
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
it
is
language
like
that
which,
and
obviously
the
jury
returned
a
death
verdict
in
the
payton
case.
and
in
the
following
pages
of
the
cap
amicus,
which
graphically,
in
real
world
terms,
demonstrates
what,
in
a
particular
case,
we
just
know
from
a
very
skilled
argument
of
a
single
state
prosecutor.
in
some...
the
mitigating
evidence
that
was
presented
in
this
case
could
not
be
considered
and
given
effect
to
by
the
jury
as
a
basis
for
sentence
less
than
death.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
yes.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
that's
right.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
well,
i
think
that
the
constitutional
test...
and
when
i
say
that
we
want
it
out,
in
agreeing
with
you,
i
really
would
quality
that
by
saying
that
we
are
comfortable,
certainly,
representing
this
petitioner,
and
comfortable
with
the
notion
that
the
caljic
modification
in
the
instruction
which
is
given
throughout
the
state,
very
satisfactorily
resolves
that
particular
dilemma.
so
that
we
don't
need
to
do
any
more
than
say
that
the
practice
will,
or
in
all
cases
after
easley
indeed,
will
have
not
been
subject
to
constitutional
problems.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
sure.
and
in
those
cases,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we
can
ascertain
from
empirical
data
like
this
that
a
reasonable
juror
would
have
been
mislead
into
believing
that
he
or
she
was
precluded
from
giving
weight,
mitigating
effect,
to
this
language--
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
--in
the
particular
case.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
well,
for
one
thing,
it
does
our
case,
hopefully,
some
good,
because
i
believe
it
supplants,
it
reinforces,
excuse
me,
reinforces
the
point
we
have
made
in
our
case.
if
you
look
at
what
the
prosecutor
said
and
did,
he
did
nothing
more
than,
for
example
on
page
14,
the
immediately,
case
immediately
following
payton,
guzman,
the
reference
to
the
fellow's
ability
to
paint.
when
you
hear
about
the
law,
the
court
will
instruct
you,
you
won't
hear
anything
about
that,
and
you
won't
be
able
to
consider
that.
this
is
exactly
what
happened
with
the
prosecutor
in
this
case.
and
in
this
case
he
gave
the
jury
the
unmistakable
message
that
they
could
not
give
mitigating
effect
to
evidence
that
did
not
fit
within
the
four
corners.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
they
were,
yes.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
well,
what
i
read
in
justice
arguelles'
dissent
on
the
second
issue,
which
i
will
turn
to
in
a
moment,
in
some
respect,
because
there
was
no
discussion
by
him
of
that,
in
some
respect
i
think
carries
over.
i
do
agree
with
you,
i
have
to,
the
decision
there
is
no,
the
dissenting
vote
concentrated,
the
dissenting
judges
concentrated
on
the
second
issue.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
yes,
they
did,
but
they
also
indicated
how
the
jury
might
be
misled,
and
it
seems--
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
--yes.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
but
remember,
they
also
allowed,
since
they
rejected
both
errors,
we
don't...
it
seems
to
me
that
it
has
a
crossover
effect,
even
a
symbiotic
effect,
that
could
be
found,
since
the
jury
neither
could
give
weight
to,
could
give
effect
to
boyde's
evidence
of
his--
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
--well,
i
certainly
don't
want
to
quarrel
with
your
characterization.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
the
dissent
did
not
disagree
with
them.
we
maintain,
nevertheless,
that
that
conclusion
was
erroneous.
the
majority
and
the
court
did
not
have
the
benefit
of
this
empirical
study.
we
believe
that--
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
--well,
i
certainly
think
he
did,
when
he
described
the
factor
incorrectly.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
it
seems
to
me
we
could
stop
there.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
all
right.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
i
believe
it
reinforces,
in
sort
of
real
world
terms,
what
one
would
only
know
to
speculate
about
without
that.
that
is,
that
a
jury,
that
if
we
just
looked
at
this
case
alone,
there
was
error,
and
error
of
constitutional
dimension.
i
believe
that
any
doubt
as
to
whether
juries
in
california
were
getting
the
right
idea
or
not
is
dispelled
by
this.
that
is
only
a
reinforcing
point,
and
in
my
view
is
unnecessary
to
the
court's
disposition
of
this
issue
in
petitioner's
favor.
i
want
to
turn
very
quickly
to
the
second
feature
of
this
case,
because
the
court
also
charged
the
jury
erroneously;
we
urge,
that
if
the
aggravating
circumstances
outweighed
the
mitigating
circumstances,
that
the
penalty
of
death
rather
than
life
in
prison
without
parole
shall
be
imposed.
now,
we
have
relied
on
a
series
of
decisions
that
have
recognized
and
affirmed
the
principle
of
individualized
assessment
of
the
appropriate
punishment,
beginning
with
woodson
versus
north
carolina,
through
sumner
versus
shuman,
and
all
the
way
to
last
term's
decision
in
penry,
even.
that
the
constitu...
this
constitutional
requirement
is
not
satisfied
by
a
state
law
which
mandates
punishment
in
a
mechanistic
way
that
does
not
allow
the
sentencers
reasoned
moral
judgment
about
the
proper
sentence
to
be
imposed.
in
sumner
versus
shuman,
for
example,
this
court
concluded
that,
even
though
the
defendant
had
committed
murder
while
already
serving
life
imprisonment
for
murder,
that
nevertheless
it
was
necessary
to,
under
the
eighth
amendment
and
fourteenth
amendment,
to
assure
reliability
of
sentencing
and
to
assure
the
proper
individualized
determination
of
the
appropriate
punishment
for
that
individual.
it
was
constitutionally
imperative
that
that
defendant
be
allowed
to
have
the
jury's
determination
of
appropriateness.
now
the
respondent
has
argued
to
the
contrary.
we
suggest
that
the
state
of
california's
position
is
in
derogation
of
shuman.
we
suggest
that
it
is
directly
contrary
to
justice
stevens'
opinions
from
the
denial
certiorari
in
smith
versus
north
carolina
and
pinch
versus
north
carolina,
where,
as
justice
stevens
recognized,
a
jury
may
find
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
warrant
the
death
penalty,
both
apart
from
the
mitigating
circumstances,
and
also
when
weighed
against
each
other,
and
yet
feel
that
a
comparison
leaves
it
in
doubt,
the
jury
in
doubt,
as
to
the
proper
penalty.
we
think
that
that
language
ought
to
be
applied
in
this
case.
we
urge
that
the
weighing
process
is
not
a
suitable
proxy--
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
--under
california
practice
as
it
presently
exists
in
the
adorned
and
clarified
instruction,
the
sentence
of
death
must
be
imposed
if
the
jury
makes
the
determination
that
death
is
the
appropriate
punishment.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
yes.
but
the
question
is
is
the
law
satisfied
merely
by
weighing,
merely
by
the
mechanistic
balancing
process--
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
--yes.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
no.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
would
i
object
to
an
instruction
that
said--
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
--if
the
jury
finds
death
is
the
appropriate
punishment?
well,
i
am
assuming,
of
course,
that
we
have
both
the
special
circumstance
and
aggravating
circumstance
aspects
of
the
law,
both
of
which
assure
the
proper
channelization
of
the
jury
sentencing--
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
--yes.
and
if,
instead
of
asking
the
jury
to
make
that
final
call,
the
jury
could
simply
be
asked
is
death
the
appropriate
penalty,
on
the
basis
of
findings
from
the
circumstances,
or
at
least
consideration
of
the
circumstances,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
well,
i
think
there
is
a
critical
difference
in
this
case.
and
i
think
the
critical
difference
is
that
the
jury
is
told
that
if
they
determine
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
outweigh
the
mitigating
circumstances,
and
parenthetically,
nothing
is
said
to
them
about
appropriateness
whatsoever,
that,
based
on
the
finding,
that
weighing
process,
then
you
shall
impose
death.
you
have
left
something
out
of
the
equation.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
i
am
sorry?
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
as
long...
i
am
not
certain
i
understood
your
question
fully.
as
long
as
the
jury
is
instructed
to
take
into
account
justice
stevens'
views
as
to
the
problem
of
aggravating
circumstances
outweighing
mitigating,
both
in
terms
of
on
their
own
and
in
comparison,
as
long
as
the
jury
is
allowed
to
bring
in
a
verdict
that
death
is
not
the
appropriate
penalty,
that
is
all
that
is
constitutionally
required.
thank
you,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
that
is
all.
that
is
all
i
am
saying.
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
very
quickly,
the
respondent
points
to
the
250
pages
of
transcript
that
it
took
to
elicit
the
evidence,
and
tries
to
make
some
point
about
it
must
have
had
some
effect.
in
fact,
in
hitchcock
versus
dugger,
we
know
that
considerable
evidence
was
elicited,
but
that
the
jury
was
precluded
from
giving
effect
to
it.
counsel
several
times
has
stated
the
language
of
factor
(k)
in
somewhat
different
language
here.
he
invariably
uses
the
words
any
other
circumstance
which
extenuates.
but
at
least
once
or
twice
i
heard
him
say
a
word
other
than
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
because
i
think
he
is
using
the
word
culpability,
or
penalty,
without
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
as
the
catchword.
if
indeed
that
is
his
concept
of
what
it
means,
then
surely
there
is
no
problem,
under
lockett
and
eddings.
but
our
position
is
that
the
language
that
the
jury
heard,
the
language
which
the
prosecutor
talked
about
and
stressed
over
and
over
again,
both
in
context
and
specifically,
is
the
language
that
this
jury
had
before
it,
was
advised
by
the
final
instructions
to
give
effect
to
and
be
guided
by,
and
to
make
its
determination
based
on
it.
the...
i
may
have
misstated
or
conceded
something
a
bit
too
quickly
in
answering
justice
white's
question.
a
quick
review
of
the
opening
words
of
the
dissenting
opinion
by
justice
arguelles
in
this
case
indicates
that
his
total
outright
concurrence
was
only
as
to
the
guilt
and
special
circumstance
phases.
we
are,
however,
past
both
of
those.
justice--
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
--well,
justice
white,
i
believe,
in
looking
at
that--
mr.
dennis
a.
fischer
--yes,
i
understand.
and
my
reading,
in
fact
triggered
by
something
that
justice
blackmun
suggested
in
referring
to
the
voir
dire
problem,
suggests
that
indeed
that
the
supreme
court's
difficulty
with
the
voir
dire
extended
to
the
meaning
of
the
final
special
circumstance.
mr.
millar
indicated
that
he
believes
that
the
jury
well
understood
its
responsibility
in
this
case.
we
can
only
look
back
at
the
district
attorney's
own
voir
dire
questions
and
explanations
of
his
understanding
of
the
factor
and
the
meanings
of
the
word
shall,
and
how
that
weighing
process
operated,
to
know
that
his
state
of
mind,
in
understanding
of
both
the
scope
of
factor
(k)
and
the
shall
instruction,
was
very
different
than
he
would
now
have
us
accept
as
the
jury's.
i
have
no
further
questions,
and
thank
you
for
your
attention.
