suppose
the
jury
is
not
in
doubt
as
to
the
appropriate
penalty,
and
that
the
penalty
is
death.
that
it
is
not
in
doubt
that
the
aggravating
factors
outweigh
mitigating
factors.
must
it
then
impose
the
sentence?
justice
kennedy
and
isn't
that
just
another
way
of
saying
that
the
jury
must
follow
the
law?
justice
kennedy
i
said
if
suppose
it
is
satisfied
that
it
is
the
appropriate
penalty.
would--
justice
kennedy
--would
you
object
to
an
obstruction
which
says,
if
you
are
satisfied
that
this
is
the
appropriate
penalty,
then
you
must
impose
it?
justice
kennedy
that
that
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
assume
all
of
that.
justice
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
this
case
is
not
far
removed
from
that.
justice
kennedy
xxx--
justice
kennedy
--with
reference
to
the
mitigating
factors,
it
is
instructed
that
it
can
and
should
consider
all
evidence
in
mitigation,
and
that
it
need
not
give
any
particular
weight
to
any
one
of
the
factors,
and
that
any
one
mitigating
factor
can
outweigh
all
aggravating
factors.
so
why
isn't
that
just
a
surrogate
for
determination
that
death
is
the
appropriate
penalty?
justice
kennedy
well,
that
is
consistent
with
his
just
saying
it
is
not
mitigating.
justice
kennedy
i
mean,
that
is
all
he
is
saying.
