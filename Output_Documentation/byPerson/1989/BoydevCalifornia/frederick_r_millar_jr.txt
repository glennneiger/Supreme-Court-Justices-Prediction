mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
begin,
if
i
might,
by
contrasting
our
basic
position
in
this
case
with
petitioner's
position,
and
then
i
would
like
to
briefly
clarify
our
position
with
regard
to
the
facial
validity
of
both
of
the
instructions
at
issue
in
this
case.
in
the
petitioner's
view,
he
had
a
jury
which
was
foreclosed
at
every
turn
from
exercising
any
discretion
or
moral
judgment
as
to
the
appropriate
penalty
in
this
case.
he
argues
that
the
jury
was
precluded
as
a
matter
of
law
by
factor
(k)
from
considering
any
of
his
four
days
of
evidence
in
mitigation,
almost
450
pages
of
transcript,
over
two
volumes
of
transcript.
he
then
argues
that
the
jury
was
further
foreclosed
by
the
word
"shall"
from
considering
the
alternative
penalty
of
life
without
parole,
life
without
possibility
of
parole,
and
was
mandated
by
the
word
"shall".
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
the
jury
would
understand
that
word--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--no.
we,
our
position
is
that
reasonable
jurors
would
understand
that
means,
that
word
"shall"
to
mean
that
after
they
had
exercised
their
discretion
and
moral
judgment
in
the
application
of
the
weighing
process,
then,
and
only
then,
would
they
be
required
to
return
a
penalty
which
was
appropriate
and
consistent
with
their
own
discretionary,
normative
application
of
the
weighing
process.
reasonable
jurors
would
not
understand
that
they
were
being
told
to
leave
behind
their
discretion
and
moral
judgment.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
that
is
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor,
as
to
whether
it
could
be
improved
upon,
or
the
instructions
could
be
better
worded.
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
they
are
constitutionally
adequate,
and
we
believe
that
they
are
clearly
constitutionally
adequate.
and
in
ramos,
this
court
specifically
upheld
the
california
statutory
scheme,
and
said
that
the
scheme
was
immune
to
attack
under
lockett,
and
further
noted
in
footnote
28
of
ramos,
referred
not
just
to
the
statutory
language,
but
to
the
specific
instruction
that
was
given
in
this
case,
the
factor
(k)
instruction,
as
well
as
the
instruction
to
consider
all
the
other
evidence
in
the
case.
and
the
court
referred
to
that
in
the
context
of
saying,
in
ramos,
that
the
briggs
instruction,
the
commutation
instruction,
did
not
really
divert
the
jury's
focus
from
the
central
purpose
of
the
sentencing
scheme.
this
was
merely
an
appendage.
and
in
contrasting
the
effect
of
the
briggs
instruction,
the
court
looked
specifically,
in
footnote
28,
to
the
instruction
to
consider
all
the
evidence,
and
in
particular
to
the
unadorned
factor
(k)
instruction,
which
was
given
in
that
case,
in
cite
of
the
transcript
record
for
that
proposition.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
the
california
supreme
court
suggested
that
the
language
be
clarified
to
prevent
any
possibility,
possibility--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--i
think
it
could
be
described
either
way,
your
honor,
improved
in
the
sense
of
making
it
clearer.
i
think
any
instruction
is
capable
of
being
clarified
or
made
clearer.
in
california
versus
brown,
for
example,
i
don't
think
the
issue
before
this
court
was
whether
the
so-called
anti-sympathy
or
mere
sympathy
instruction
was
worded
as
well
as
it
might
possibly
be
worded.
the
issue
was
whether
it
was
constitutionally
adequate--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor,
i
missed
that.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
i
think
it's
important,
and
the
test
that
this
court
has
applied
in
california
versus
brown
is
what
reasonable
jurors
would
do.
with
respect
to
factor
(k)
it
is
our
position
that
reasonable
jurors
would
understand
that
the
words
any
other
circumstances
which
extenuate
mean
just
that,
any
other
circumstances
which
extenuate,
or
mitigate,
or
lessen
the
penalty,
the
culpability
of
the
defendant.
and
i
think,
referring
to
justice
o'connor's
concurring
opinion
in
california
versus
brown,
i
think
it
is
interesting
that
she
noted
there
that
the
reason
why
we
allow
jurors
to
consider
such
things
as
deprived
childhoods
and
things
like
that
is
because
of
society's
collective
belief
that
these
things
mitigate
culpability.
now,
reasonable
jurors
are
part
of
society.
they
presumably
go
into
the
jury
room
sharing
this
basic
notion.
when
they
see
factor
(k),
which
says
any
other
circumstance
which
mitigates
or
which
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
these
reasonable,
common
sense
jurors
are
going
to
adopt
a
construction
of
factor
(k)
which
is
inconsistent
with
society's
basic
belief,
that
such
evidence
does
mitigate
or
extenuate.
i
would
point
out,
also,
that
the
petitioner's
position
really
changes
the
language
of
factor
(k).
what
he
wants
that
instruction
to
read
is
any
other
circumstance
of
the
crime
which
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
it
does
not
say
that.
it
says
any
other
circumstance
which
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
he
wants
to
add
the
words
of
the
crime
to
the
first
part.
the
words
any
other
circumstance
are
not
modified
by
of
the
crime.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
but,
your
honor,--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--same
thing
could
be
true,
said,
of
the
other
factors
(b)
through
(j).
how
does
the
age
of
the
defendant
change
the
fact
that
this
victim
has
been
killed--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--in
a
terrible
way.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
but,
i--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--my
point--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--excuse
me.
my
point
is
that
factors
(b)
through
(j)
all
relate
to
the
individual
culpability
of
the
defendant.
factor
(k)
tells
the
jury
any
other
circumstance
which
extenuates--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--to
relate
to
the
culpability
of
the
defendant.
and
i
would
point
this
out,
the
words
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
what
does
the
gravity
of
the
crime
mean?
it
is
not
specifically
defined
in
any
of
these
instructions.
the
gravity
of
the
crime
is
factors
(a)
through
(j),
and
then
adding
on
(k).
(a)
is
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
if
in
fact,
and
there
was
not
here,
but
if
in
fact
there
were
any
mitigating
circumstances
of
the
crime,
directly
related
to
the
crime,
they
can
already
be
considered
by
the
jury
under
factor
(a).
the
jury
does
not
even
need
factor
(k)
to
tell
them
that.
reasonable
jurors
would
understand
that
factor
(k)
is
therefore
necessarily
different
and
much
broader
than
just
factor
(k),
factor
(a),
excuse
me,
relating
to
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
i
don't
believe,
and
i
would...
our
position
is
this
court
should
not
get
into
a
discussion
of
what
particular
prosecutors
did--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--well,
in
the
first
place,
your
honor,
we're
talking
about
two
cases
that
the
defendant
has
been
able
to
cite--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--but,
the
issue
here--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--well,
the
issue
here
is
whether--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--i
would
say
that,
that--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--i
would
say
that
he
misled
the
jurors
in
those
case,
as
far
as
what
the
face
of
that--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--well,
i
think
we
are
speculating
as
far
as
what
particular
prosecutors
did
in
particular--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--he
may
have,
your
honor,
but
these
jurors
did
not
hear
that
prosecutor.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
well,
if
that
is
the
test
then,
your
honor,
then
the
test
is
whether
anyone
could
possibly
misunderstand
the
instruction.
the
test
that
this
court
has
set
forth
in
california
versus
brown
is
whether
reasonable
jurors
would.
these
jurors
did
not
hear
arguments
by
a
prosecutor
in
their
case
which
would
mislead
them.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
that
is
correct.
these
jurors
did
not
hear
that
in
this
case.
these
jurors
were
told,
and
i
might
even
note
this,
with
respect
to
the
factor
(k)
instruction,
the
prosecutor
repeatedly
referred
to
all
the
evidence
in
the
case.
in
fact,
he
repeatedly
referred
to
the
defendant's
own
expert
testimony,
expert
witness,
dr.
rothenstein.
and
he
told
the
jury
that
he
had
a
lot
of
trouble
disagreeing
and
cross-examining
dr.
rothenstein,
because
he
agreed
with
so
much
of
what
he
said.
that
was
a
defense
witness.
how
can
the
prosecutor
be
arguing
to
the
jury
in
this
case
not
to
consider
any
of
the
defense
evidence
when
he
specifically
told
the
jury
that
he
agreed
with
dr.
rothenstein
and
what
he
was
saying?
dr.
rothenstein
talked
about
why
this
defendant
needed
to
exercise
violence,
and
why
he
needed
to
exercise
control
over
the
lives
of
individuals,
over
the
lives
of
victims.
dr.
rothenstein
suggested
that
was
because
of
the
defendant's
childhood
and
background.
however,
the
prosecutor
argued
it
was
because
that
was
part
of
the
defendant's
personality,
that
was
the
way
he
was.
and,
with
respect,
by
the
way,
to
that
evidence,
that's
at
reporter's
transcript
pages
4770,
4774
and
4775,
where
the
prosecutor
repeatedly
referred
to
the
testimony
of
the
defendant's
own
expert.
the
prosecutor
could
not
have
been
arguing
on
the
one
hand,
consider
dr.
rothenstein's
testimony,
and
on
the
other
be
arguing
to
the
jury
you
can't
consider
any
of
the
ex,
any
of
the
defendant's--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--well--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--yes,
he
argued
that
in
the--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--yes,
exactly,
your
honor.
every...
yes,
and
he
argued
that
in
the
context
of
this
case
it
was
his
belief
that
that
evidence
was
not
mitigating
to
the
extent
that
it
outweighed
the
gravity
of
what
this
defendant
did,
when
you
looked
at
all
of
the
factors
in
this
case.
and
he
never
told
the
jury,
don't
consider
any
one
of
these
particular
factors.
he
told
them,
to
the
contrary,
consider
all
of
these
factors.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
our
position
with
respect
to
the
prosecutor's
behavior
at
voir
dire
is
that,
first
of
all,
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
a
valid,
reliable
basis
for
determining
whether
jurors
properly
understood
the
court's
charge
to
the
jury
at
the
conclusion
of
the
penalty
phase
of
the
trial.
and
second
of
all,
that
even
should
the
court
conclude
that
we
can
look
at
the
voir
dire
examination,
that
the
prosecutor
did
not
in
fact
mislead
the
jury.
what
he
did,
simply,
was
to
tell
the
jury
that
they
were
not
going
to
be
having
totally
arbitrary
and
free
reign
in
deciding
the
penalty,
that
they
were
going
to
have
standards
which
were
going
to
guide
the
exercise
of
their
discretion,
that
it
was
important
that
they
proceed
to
come
to
a
rational
conclusion,
that
it
was
not
a
matter
of
on
monday
you
can
reach
one
result
in
the
case
and
on
tuesday
that
you
can
reach
a
different
result.
he
specifically
told
the
jury
that
we
used
to
have
a
system
like
that,
where
the
jury
had
unbridled
discretion
to
do
whatever
it
wanted,
but
that
the
courts
had
said
we
needed
more
rationality
in
the
process,
and
that
they
would
be
required
to
apply
some
standards,
some
criteria,
to
guide
a
rational
determination
of
the
appropriate
penalty
in
this
case.
and
it
is
our
position
that
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
telling
the
jury
that.
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
has
required
ever
since
furman.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
well,
i
certainly
respect
your
honor's
right
to
disagree
with
what
i
am
arguing,
but
i
believe
that...
well,
first
of
all,
the
california
supreme
court,
the
majority
of
the
california
supreme
court,
said,
with
respect
to
the
prosecutor's
voir
dire
examination,
that
it
was
no
more
in
substance
than
a
capsule
summary
of
what
this
court
has
required
of
jurors.
and
the
prosecutor
was
only
exploring
general
attitudes
of
jurors
during
the
voir
dire
examination.
he
was
not
specifically
arguing
the
case
to
them
at
that
time.
his
purpose,
and
the
purpose
of
voir
dire
examination
under
california
law,
is
simply
to
determine
whether
the
jurors
are
able
to
follow
the
law.
and
we
think
that
any
voir
dire
comments
ought
to
be
construed,
if
they
are
going
to
be
looked
at
at
all,
in
that
light.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
well,
the
court
was
unanimous,
as
has
been
pointed
out
previously,
i
believe
by
justice
white,
was
unanimous
on
the
factor
(k)
issue,
and
split
four
to
three
on
the
"shall"
issue.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
the
majority
said
two
things--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--yes.
the
majority...
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
the
majority
said
that
they
did
not
believe
that
that
was
a
valid,
reliable
basis
that
they
should
look
to,
and
second
of
all,
that
even
if
they
did
look
to
it,
that
the
dissent
had
misconstrued
the
substance
of
what
the
prosecutor
had
told
the
jurors
in
voir
dire,
and
that
given
the
context
of
voir
dire,
he
did
no
more
than
tell
the
jurors
in
substance
what
this
court
has
required
of
jurors,
to
be
rational.
that
they
would
be
required
to
apply
certain
criteria,
and
would
not
have
total
and
absolute
discretion.
and
he
asked
them
will
you
be
able
to
follow
the
law.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
would
point
out
that
the
jury
was
specifically
told
twice
during
the
instructions
by
the
court
to
consider
all
the
evidence
in
the
case.
the
prosecutor
emphasized
that
to
the
jury.
the
prosecutor
did
not
ignore
the
evidence
under
factor
(k).
in
fact,
his
argument
with
respect
to
factor
(k)
was
rather
that
he
had
a
different
view
of
what
the
defendant
was
like
than
the
defense
counsel
was
arguing.
his
view
was
that
we
have
here
a
man
who
lies,
who
deceives,
who
would
make
up
a
fictitious
big
mike,
who
would
even
blame
his
cousin
for
the
commission
of
this
terrible
crime,
who
was
a
violent
individual.
he
said
that
is
the
kind
of
person
we
have.
and
then
he
turned
to
the
evidence
in
mitigation,
and
he
said
that
that
evidence
simply
did
not
mitigate
against
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
all
of
the
other
factors,
which
the
jury
was
entitled
to
consider
under
the
instructions.
and
he
said,
i
suppose
we
are
all
a
product
of
our
backgrounds
to
some
degree
or
another.
he
did
not
say
you
can't
consider
that.
what
he
said
was,
we
are
all
a
product
of
our
backgrounds.
i
am
not
saying
you
can't
consider
that,
but
how
much
does
that
count
in
the
context
of
this
case,
in
the
context
of
the
gravity
of
this
crime.
how
much
does
it
count.
he
suggested
first
that
it
counted
not
at
all,
and
then
he
suggested
later
in,
i
believe
it
was
his
rebuttal
argument,
that
even
if
the
jury
disagreed
with
him
and
was
inclined
to
give
it
some
weight,
they
still
needed
to
ask
themselves
the
ultimate
question,
which
was
does
it
outweigh
the
other
circumstances,
which
he
argued
were
all
in
aggravation.
i
would
like
to
turn
my
attention
at
this
point
to
the
second
issue,
the
"shall"
issue.
as
i
have
indicated
before,
it
is
our
position
that
this
instruction,
like
the
factor
(k)
instruction,
is
valid
on
its
face.
it
is
our
position
that
this
court
should
not
even
have
to
look
at
the
arguments
of
counsel
to
reach
that
determination,
but
that
if
the
court
wants
to,
to
satisfy
itself
as
the
california
supreme
court
did,
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
constitutionally
prohibited.
but
our
basic--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that,
that
it's
the
functional
equivalent
to
the
extent
that,
as
our
california
supreme
court
has
said,
that
what
the
jury
is
supposed
to
do
is
to
weigh
the
various
factors--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--and
decide
what
outweighs.
and
in
the
context
of
doing
that,
they
apply
their
discretion
and
moral
judgment.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
and
to
that
extent,
i
think
that
it
is
a
functional
equivalent.
our
position--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--is
there
is
no
separate
and
independent
requirement
of
appropriateness.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
what
i
would
say
is
that
those
cases
really
prove
nothing.
they
would
prove
no
more
than
comparing
how
many
cases
where
the
jury
came
back
with--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--for
death
in
california
versus
virginia,
which
has
a
different
system.
they
are
comparing
apples
and
oranges.
the
system
that
is
used
in
those
alameda
county
cases,
which
is
not
the
standard
norm
set
forth
in
california
by
our
california
supreme
court,
is
a
two-step
system--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--and
the
jury
is
told
may.
and,
there
are
two
possibilities.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
except
that
we
don't
know
what
they
are
doing
when
they
are
deciding
outweighs
in
the
first
step
of
that
two-step
process.
we--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--yes,
because
in
the
case
of
the
one-step
process
we
know
that
they
are
applying
their
discretion
and
moral
judgment,
because
that
is
the
only
opportunity
they
have
to
do
that.
in
that
two-step
process,
jurors
may
well
believe,
first
of
all,
that
they
are
supposed
to
make
some
kind
of
a
mechanical
determination
in
the
determination
of
what
outweighs
what,
perhaps
adding
them
up
or
something
like
that.
and
not
until
they
get
to
the
second
part
are
they
really
deciding
the
penalty.
in
petitioner's
case,
they
had
one
procedure
by
which
they
were
to
decide
penalty.
the
second
possibility
with
respect
to
those
alameda
county
cases
is,
is
that
the
jurors
may
be
disregarding
totally
the
weighing
process,
when
they
are
told
you
may
do
this
or
you
may
do
that.
we
don't
really
know
how
they
are--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--well,
what
i
would
say
in
that
regard
is
that
may
be
a
constitutional
variation.
i
am
not
saying,
and
i
don't
want
to
be
understood
as
saying
that
that
is
an
unconstitutional
procedure,
but
that
is
not
the
norm.
and
it
is
not
the
norm,
as
the
cali...
the
majority
of
the
california
supreme
court
specifically
said
in
this
case,
it
is
not
a
two-step
process,
it
is
a
one-step
process.
now,
alameda--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
yes,
your
honor.
and
whether
that
is
a
constitutional
approach
is
not
something
i
am...
is
before
this
court.
i
am
defending
the
constitutionality
here
of
the
approach
in
this
case,
which
is
the
norm
in
california,
and
which
the
california
supreme
court
has
said
it
is
a
one-step
process
where
the
jury
exercises
discretion
and
moral
judgment
as
part
of
that
process.
when
you
break
it
down
into
two-steps,
and
you
tell
the
jury
may,
you
really
don't
know
what
is
happening.
so,
just
to
take
those
figures
and
to
say
they
mean
a
certain
thing,
it
does
not
follow
from
those
assumptions.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
i
guess
anything
is
possible,
but
we
don't
believe
that
reasonable,
common
sense
jurors
would
have
done
that.
and
that's
certainly
not
they
were,
what
they
were
told
in
this
case.
and
in
that
regard
i
would
point
out--
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
--well,
we
don't...
they
were
not
specifically
told
that
that
is
what
they
were
doing.
we
believe
that
that
is
what
reasonable
jurors
would
do.
mr.
frederick
r.
millar,
jr.
and
when
i
say
they
weren't
told,
i
want
to
point
out
in
the
arguments
they
were
clearly
told
that.
the
very
last
thing
that
the
prosecutor
told
this
jury
in
this
case,
his
first
opening
argument
was,
he
said
but
don't
try
to
avoid
the
tough
decision
by
sitting
and
trying
to
rationalize
or
trying
to
seek
a
way
out
of
a
tough
decision.
you
are
going
to
have
to
face
it
head
on.
you
are
going
to
have
to
decide,
have
to
go
through
each
and
every
one
of
these
factors
and
decide
it.
is
this
the
case,
is
this
the
kind
of
case,
as
i
am
guided
by
these
factors,
that
warrants
the
death
penalty.
i
don't
read
that
as
some
kind
of
mandatory
language
analogous
to
roberts
or
woodson.
and
that
is
at
joint
appendix
page
24.
and
the
prosecutor
told
the
jury
exactly
the
same
thing
in
the
very
last
words
that
he
left
the
jury
with.
in
his
concluding
argument
he
said
this
is
the
last
time
i
will
speak
to
you,
and
i
don't
really
have
much
more
to
say.
i
am
not
going
to
go
through
each
one
of
these
factors
in
aggravation.
you
have
all
heard
this
case.
you
all
understand
it.
you
know
it
as
well
as
i
do.
i
ask
only
that
as
you
begin
the
deliberation
process,
that
you
all
participate,
that
you
all
approach
it
with
the
eye
of
coming
and
reaching
a
decision
if
you
can
do
so.
that
you
listen
to
everyone
else,
that
you
be
willing
to
accept
their
ideas,
and
that
you
think
in
your
mind
and
be
guided
by
this
one
thing,
the
case,
which
according
to
law
is
given,
and
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
warrants
the
death
penalty.
ask
yourselves
that.
you
might
also
ask
yourselves
what
would
i
like
to
have
or
not
have
more
that
would
warrant
it
one
way
or
the
other.
that
is
at
joint
appendix
pages
30
to
31.
that
is
not
mandatory
language.
this
jury
knew
that
it
was
to
exercise
its
discretion
and
moral
judgment.
there
is
absolutely
no
question
about
that,
both
on
the
face
of
the
instruction
and
in
terms
of
what
they
were
told
by
counsel
in
this
case.
and
if
i
might
just
conclude
my
argument,
i
would
point
out
again
that,
in
our
position,
reasonable,
common
sense
jurors
would
have
understood
these
instructions
on
their
face
to
be
constitutionally
valid,
and
to
describe
accurately
their
constitutional
duty.
if
the
court
feels
any
need
to
look
at
the
arguments
of
counsel
in
this
case,
it
will
only
confirm
that
conclusion.
and,
if
the
court
has
no
questions,
we
will
submit.
