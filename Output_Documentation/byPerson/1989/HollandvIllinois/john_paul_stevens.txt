justice
stevens
we
very
rarely
do
that
if
the
lawyer
is
unwilling
even
to
say
he
relies
on
it.
justice
stevens
you
haven't
argued
it
yet.
justice
stevens
the
standing
issue
is
really
quite
interesting
because,
as
justice
white
points
out,
batson
wasn't
a
member
of
the
class
that
was
at
issue
in
the
case.
he
happened
to
be
of
the
same
race,
but
the
class
was
prospective
jurors.
justice
stevens
and
i
don't
know
whether
you're
assuming
that
he
had
standing
because
he
was
of
the
same
race
or
because
he
was
a
defendant
who
objected
to
the
adverse
consequences
upon
him
of
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
against
others.
justice
stevens
supposing
you
had
a
state...
that's
probably
very
improbable,
but
just
to
get
a
point
across...
in
which...
a
trial
court
in
which
the
judge
followed
a
practice
of
always
excluding
black
jurors
from
an
otherwise,
you
know,
cross-section
panel
and
the
resulting
jury
was
nevertheless
composed
of
12
people
who
were
found
to
be
impartial,
would
the
defendant
have
any
basis
for...
constitutional
basis
for
objecting
to
such
a
procedure?
a
white
defendant?
justice
stevens
but
i'm
assuming
they're
in
the
jury
pool.
now,
they're
in
the
jury
pool
and
in
the
venire
and
you
say
that's...
if
your
position
is
that
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game,
i
take
it
there
would
be
no
remedy
if
a
judge
did
it
at
the...
during
the
selection
of
the
petit
jury...
just
refused
to
seat
any
blacks.
justice
stevens
but
could
a
white...
could
a
white
defendant
object
to
that?
justice
stevens
so
that
such
a
practice
would
be
permissible
in
all
cases
where
the
defendant
is
not
black?
justice
stevens
then
what
would--
justice
stevens
--what
would
be...
the
means
would
be
by
passing
a
law
to
get
them
to
stop?
justice
stevens
my
question
is
whether
a
white
defendant
could
object.
justice
stevens
why,
then,
would
a
black
defendant
have
standing
because
he
would
also
not
be
a
member
of
the
class?
justice
stevens
i
must
confess
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by
that
argument.
who
is
making...
you
only
have
one
defendant
who
is
objecting
to
the...
to
what
the
prosecutor
does.
justice
stevens
he
can't
both
insist
that
they
seat
these
two
people
and
object
to
their
seating.
justice
stevens
whatever
he
is.
justice
stevens
yes.
as
he
objects
to
the
prosecutor's
use
of
the
peremptories.
but
he
couldn't
also
then
turn
around
and
say,
i'd
like
to
have
them
seated.
justice
stevens
i
really
don't
think
that's
a
very
realistic
problem.
i
think
either
he's
going
to
object
or
he
isn't
going
to
object.
justice
stevens
well,
let
me...
i'm
sorry.
did
you
finish
your
answer?
i
didn't--
justice
stevens
--let
me
give
you
another
example.
in
illinois
you
pick
your
juries
by
panels
of
four,
if
i
remember
correctly,
that
come
in
in
sequence.
justice
stevens
and
usually
the
ones
who
get
in
earliest
have
the
greatest
likelihood
of
being
selected.
supposing
they
had
a
system
where
all
the
men
went
first
and
then
the
women
went
later?
would
that
raise
any
sixth
amendment
concerns?
you
have
a
fair
venire
but
then
you
have
this
procedure
between
venire
and
petit
jury
that
the
men
go
first.
justice
stevens
you
don't
think
it
would
raise
an
equal
protection...
i
mean,
a
sixth
amendment
concern?
justice
stevens
just
a
fair
trial--
