chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-5050,
daniel
holland
v.
illinois.
mr.
honchell,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
does
that
give
you
a
fair
cross-section
jury
if...
if...
justice
white's
hypothesis
is
that
out
of
12
there
are
12
blacks?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
selection
process
need
not
result
in
a
fair
cross-section
in
your
view?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
do
we
go
about
deciding
the
first
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
there's
also
rather
strong
in
lockhart,
isn't
there,
that
the
fair
cross-section
applies
only
to
the
venire
and
not
to
the
panel?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
those
reasons
are
very
often
generalizations
about...
you...
you...
you
can't
know
the
person
individually
so
you
make
generalizations,
often
on
the
basis
of
race,
religion,
appearance,
you
know,
manner
of
dress,
job.
and,
you
know,
it
may
be
a
false
assumption,
but
the
whole
system
is
built
on
generalization.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
your
case
tried
after
batson
came
down?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
was
a
batson
claim
raised
in
the
lower
courts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
honchell.
ms.
fryklund,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
fryklund.
mr.
honchell,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
honchell.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-5050,
holland
against
illinois
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
