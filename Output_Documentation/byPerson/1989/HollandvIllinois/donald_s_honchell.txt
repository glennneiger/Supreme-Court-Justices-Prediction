mr.
donald
s.
honchell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
daniel
holland
in
this
cause
faced
criminal
charges
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county,
illinois,
and
he
elected
trial
by
a
jury,
as
assured
by
the
sixth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
however,
in
the
process
used
to
select
that
jury,
the
state
used
its
peremptory
challenges
to
exclude
both
of
the
eligible
blacks
from
service
on
the
jury.
this
case,
therefore,
involves
the
need
to
provide
white
defendants
with
a
remedy
to
challenge
such
a
process.
a
process
in
which
black
prospective
jurors
are
removed
by
a
peremptory
challenge
on
the
unjustified
false
assumption
that
as
blacks
they
are
unqualified
to
serve,
endangers
recognized
essential
values
of
jury
trial,
as
contemplated
by
this
court
under
the
sixth
amendment.
this
court
now
prohibits
the
unfair
selection
of
the
venire
based
on
the
false
assumption
as
to
disqualifications
of
blacks
due
to
group
membership,
and
the
petitioner
simply
asks
that
this
court
equally
prohibit
the
unfair
process
in
the
voir
dire
selection.
this
court
has
barred
the
state
from
interfering
with
the
fair
possibility
that
the
cross-section
reaches
the
petit
jury
at
the
outset
of
the
jury
selection
process
in
the
formulation
of
the
jury
roles
and
the
jury
rosters.
this
court
has
assumed
that
with
the
random
selection
the
fair
possibility
will
reach
the
venire
from
which
the
petit
jury
will
be
selected.
and
this
court
simply
cannot
allow
the
prosecutor
to
do
in
a
single
trial
what
the
government
is
barred
from
doing
on
the
basis
of
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
the
issue
in
the
case
is
protecting
the
process
of
selecting
the
jury,
and
in
that
situation,
where
individuals
are
removed
by
peremptory
challenge
on
the
basis
of
their
race
on
the
false
assumption
that
they
are
unqualified,
that
is
injury
to
the
process
and--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--the
fair
cross-section
argument
has
to
be
understood
in
a...
in
a
very
broad
perspective.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
he
would
be
barred
from
using
peremptory
challenges
to
remove
otherwise
qualified
jurors,
black
jurors,
on
the
false
assumption
that
because
of
their
race
they're
not
qualified
to
serve.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
if
the...
if
the
prosecutor
is
allowed
to
use
his
peremptory
challenges
simply
on
the
basis
of
his
false
assumptions
and
his
biases,
it
is
a
severe
injury
to
the
selection
process.
and
that
is
the
key
to--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--well,
that
is...
that
is
true.
yes.
the...
the...
issue
is
the
prohibition
against
misusing
peremptory
challenges
to
remove
the
fair
possibility
of
a
cross-section
on
the
jury.
now,
a
defendant
would
have
the
obligation
to
demonstrate
that
the
prosecutor's
removal
was
based
on
the
membership
and
therefore
was
based
on
the
prohibited
false
assumptions.
and
it
may...
in
possible
situations
he
would
be
unable
to
make
that
demonstration
from
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
that
the
challenges
were
based
on
race.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
that...
that...
that's
correct.
there
is
no
evidence
in...
in
the
record
on
this...
on
this...
in
this
case.
the--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--yes.
the--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--yes.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
process
of...
of
choosing
from
the
venire
those
jurors
who
are
going
to
serve
as
the
truly
representative
voice
of
the
community.
and
it's
an
essential,
given
this
court's
emphasis
on
what
a
jury
must
do,
the
function
that
a
jury
serves,
and
the
process
of
selecting
that
jury.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
the...
the
issue
of...
of
what
groups
it...
it...
it...
it
would
apply
to
is...
is
an
open
question.
it's...
it's...
it's
difficult,
as
this
court
recognized
in
lockhart
v.
mccree,
to
specify
what
groups
qualify
for
examination.
and
we
think
that
it's
a...
it's...
it's
an
analysis
that
has
to
be
limited.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
well,
yes,
that's
been
done,
and...
and--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--we're
saying
in
this
case
that
whites
have
the
authority
to
object
to
blacks.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
if
rich
people
and
poor
people
are...
are
distinctive
groups
for
purposes
of
determining
damage
to
the
system
from
its
removal
on
the
basis
of
that
characteristic,
and
whether
there
is
a
showing
that
they
were
removed
on
the
basis
of
that
characteristic.
so
the
quest
is
really
twofold.
first
of
all,
are
we
dealing
with
the
distinctive
group
whose
removal
should
be
of
concern,
and,
secondly,
is
there
a
demonstration
that
the
removal
was
based
on
that
membership?
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
i'd...
i
would
refer
the
court
to
lockhart
which
is
a...
which
is
an
indication
that
it's
difficult
because
this
court
never
said
in
lockhart
what
groups
or
what
distinctive--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--yes.
yes.
that
is
a...
there
is
a
discussion
there,
but
we
would
argue
that
that
has...
has
misconstrued
what
we
contend
is
a
fair
cross-section
requirement
because
that
seems
to
suggest
that
there
is
a
mandatory
affirmative
duty
to
include,
which
is
unworkable
and
unsound
to
apply
to
the
petit
jury.
and
we're
certainly
not
asking
that
that
concept
be
used.
what
we
propose
as
a
fair
cross-section
requirement
is
that
assuming
that
there
is
the
affirmative
obligation
at
the
outset,
that
there
remain
the
fair
possibility
thereafter
that
what
this
court
has
considered
worthy
of
inclusion
last
throughout
the
system
and
actually
sits
on
the
jury.
so,
we
would
argue
that
the
fair
cross-section
requirement
is
prohibitory,
that
the
prosecutors
are
prohibited
from
removing
cognizable
groups
or
distinctive
groups
on
false
assumptions
because
it
minimizes
the
fair
possibility
of
serving
on
the...
on
the
jury.
but
going
to
the
assumption
that
there
is
such
a
fair
cross-section
argument,
the
court
in
lockhart
did
decide,
attempted
to
decide
and
define
what
a
distinctive
group
was.
the
court--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--yes,
but
the...
the
false
assumption
is--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--there
is
a
false
assumption
that
all
rich
people
are
necessarily
biased
and
will
be
biased
in
this
case
and,
therefore,
i
may...
i
may
exclude
a
person
simply
because
he--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--that's...
that's...
that's
correct,
but
the
question
becomes
is
that
a
constitutional
peremptory
challenge
as
this
court
has
come
to
define
it
most
especially
in
the
batson
case.
the
assumption
in
batson
was,
well,
the
black
defendant
is
unqualified
to
serve;
he'll...
he'll
be
more
partial
to
a
black
defendant.
therefore,
i
can
properly
use
a
peremptory
to
strike
a
black.
and
this
court
has
said,
no,
we...
we
cannot
allow
prosecutors
to
make
generalizations
and
generalities
simply
on
this
distinctive
qualification.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
the...
the
proper
use
of
peremptory
challenge
is...
is
to
supplement
challenges
for
cause
in
order
to
remove
those
who
are
for
particular
reasons
that
the
prosecutor
simply
cannot
articulate,
or,
more
importantly,
cannot
convince
the
judge...
renders
this
person
unqualified
to
serve.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes,
and
this
is
the
tension
between
peremptory
challenges
and
the
fair
selection
of
the
jury.
and
this
court
must
integrate
those
two
opposing
concerns.
there
is
a
recognition
from
this
court
when
the
peremptories
are
used
against
blacks
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
demonstrate
that
the
decision
to
exclude
was
based
on
a
false
assumption
that
just
because
the
person
was
black...
and
for
no
other
reason...
nothing
having
to
do
with
his
income,
which
his
status,
with
his
marital
state...
with
absolutely
no
other
evaluations
whatsoever
you
decided
that
this
person
cannot
serve
on
the
jury
because
he's
black.
this
court
said,
well,
that's
not
a
constitutional
peremptory
challenge
because
there
are
limitations
that
are
presented
by
this
use
of
the
peremptory
challenge.
there
are
dangers,
there
are
limitations
and
frustrations
that
are
introduced
which
this
court
must
correct.
and
under
that
analysis
and
under
that
assumption
this
court
simply
should
not
allow
peremptory
challenges
to
overrule,
to
override
the
commitment
of
this
court
to
a
selection
process
which
is
designed
to
assure
the
fair
possibility
that
the
cross-section
will
actually
serve
on
the
jury.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
something
beyond...
i
certainly
didn't
mean
those
to
be
decisive
or
necessarily--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
and
the...
this
court
need
only
decide
the
cognizable
group
of
blacks.
but
i
simply
meant
to
illustrate
that
in
order
to
use
the
peremptory--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--it
would
be
based
on
this
court's
recognition
that
the
removal
of
blacks
by
peremptory
challenge
suggests
that
prosecutors
are
misusing
the
challenges
to
remove
on
grounds
of
race.
there
has
been--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--the
argument
has
elements
of
equal
protection
analysis
to
it
because
there
is
the
concern
for
the
excluded
jurors.
but
there's
also
concerns
beyond
the
equal
protection
analysis
that
benefits
the
jurors.
the
concern
for
the
defendant's
right
to
have
his
guilt
or
innocence
judged
by
a
common
sense
interplay
of
all
the
values
and
perspectives
of
groups
in
the
community,
the
value
of
the
system
in
having
it
operate
in
a...
in
a
manner
which
enhances
its
dignity.
the
concern
of
other
members
of
society
that
they
are
able
to
look
at
this
process
of
jury
selection
and
have
confidence
in
the
system,
give
it
support,
allow
it
to
function
with
the
full
community
backing.
so,
there
are
these
factors
which...
in
addition
to
the
concerns
for
the
feelings
and
attitudes
of
the
excluded
jurors.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
if
this
court
could
determine
that
the
sixth
amendment
applied
in
the
civil
context,
that
in
fact
the
sixth
amendment
was
applicable
to
civil--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--the
seventh
amendment
demonstrates
that
there
is
a--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
the
difficulty...
the
difficulty,
unfortunately,
is
that
the
sixth
amendment...
or
not
so
unfortunately...
but
the
difficulty
is
that
the
violation
under
the
sixth
amendment
comes
from
the
governmental
interference,
whereas
under
the
seventh
amendment
there
would
be
interference
by
a
second
private
counsel
or
an
opposing
litigant
as--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--the
argument
we
present
is
that
certainly
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
do
so.
and
there
is
certainly
a
value
to
applying
this
to
the
civil...
civil
branch.
it's
certainly
not
an
issue
that's
been
developed
in
this
case
and
it
may
need
to
await
analysis
and
argument
in
civil
courts.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
it
puts
the
burden
on
the
defendant
to
demonstrate
that
this
is
a
member
of
the...
of
the
black
race.
and,
in
addition,
he's
being
excluded
on
grounds
of
membership
in
that
race.
if
the
defendant
can't
demonstrate
that
these
individuals
are
members
of
what
he
argues
to
be
and
persuades
the
court
to
be
a
distinctive
group,
then
there's
no
analysis
on
their
removal.
so,
it
would
depend
on
the
local
judges
who
are
able
to
determine
from
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
whether
these
are
members
of
the
congnizable
group
or
the
distinctive
group.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
the
concern
is
not
what
kind
of
jury
is
gotten.
the
concern
is
the
process
in
getting
the
jury
itself.
and
we're
advocating
that
this
court
simply
protect
the
process
of
selecting
the
petit
jury
from
a
venire
which
is
already
protected
by
this
court's
decisions
selected
from
the
jury
roles,
which
is
also
protected
by
this
court's
decision.
so
we've
certainly
discovered
the
weak
link
in
this
process
of
jury
selection,
because
this
court
has
insisted
that
the
system
function
to
assure
an
eventual
jury
which
will
protect
the
defendant
as
a
hedge
against
the
prosecutors
and
the
government,
against
arbitrary
power
by
ensuring
the
common-sense
views
of
the
community,
by
assuring
that
the
system
functions
and
does
so
with
respect.
and
yet,
the
prosecutor,
despite
this
court's
commitment
to
that
kind
of
a
jury
selection
system,
can
simply
use
a
peremptory
challenge
and
thereby
evade
at
the
petit
jury
at
the
voir
dire
stage
what
this
court
has
demanded
as
a
ban
at
earlier
stages
of
the
jury
process.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
the
court
should
conclude
that
the
purpose
of
putting
them
on
the
venire
is
not
simply
for
the
symbolic
value
of
saying
that
now
they've
reached
the...
that
stage
in
the
case
and,
therefore,
we're
free
to
remove
them
thereafter.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
then
the
question
becomes
how
peremptories
can
be
constitutionally
used.
if
they
can
be
used,
or
if
they
are
used,
or
if
the
argument
is
that
they
are
being
used
to
remove
blacks
in
this
case
simply
on
the
grounds
of
race,
this
court
should
conclude
that
that
is
an
unconstitutional
use
of
the
peremptory
challenge
in
the
trial
of
a
white
defendant,
just
as
it's
an
unconstitutional
use
of
a
peremptory
challenge
in
the
trial
of
a
black
defendant
because
it
defeats
the
possibility
that
the
fair
cross-section
which
is
sitting
on
the
venire
waiting
to
serve
actually
reaches
the
petit
jury
where
it
will
have
value.
there
is
more
than
symbolic
value
to
having
members
of
mixed
races
on
the
petit
jury.
it's
a
significant
benefit
to
the
defendant
in
protecting
himself
against
the
prosecutors
and
the
arbitrary
judges.
but,
moreover,
the
process
of
selecting
that
jury
has
a
value
that
must
be
protected.
it's
a
way
to
enhance
the
jury
system
so
that
it
functions
in
the
community
so
that
the
community
has
confidence
in
the
government
for
which
it
must...
with
which
it
must
live.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes,
your
honor.
because
of
the
happenstance
of
that
case
with
a
black
defendant
and
a
black
juror,
this
court
determined
that
that
was
a
valid--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--yes,
by...
well,
no,
the
court
focused
in
on
the
equal
protection
of
the
black
juror,
which
the
defendant
was
given
standing
because
he
was
a
member
of
the
same
race,
to
raise
as
an
argument
to
overturn
the
conviction.
and,
therefore,
it--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--the
difficulty,
of
course,
is
that
he
lacks
the
traditional
standing
aspect
because
he's
not
a
member
of
the
same
race.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
that's...
that's
one
possible
outcome.
but
this
court
would
have
to
overlook
the
standing
element
or
find
that
nevertheless,
despite
the
standing--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--undoubtedly.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
well,
we're
certainly
not
precluding
the
equal
protection
argument
as
being
persuasive
in
this
case
because
in
effect
there's
that
argument
and
there's
more,
because
there
are
sixth
amendment--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--no.
no.
the
trial
did
not
apply
to
batson,
although
the
case
was
on
direct
appeal
at
the
time
of
batson.
and
the
issue
that
was
raised
in
the
lower
court
was
the
denial
of
sixth
amendment
on
the
basis
of
taylor
versus
louisiana.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
no.
the
issue
was
sixth
amendment.
because,
of
course,
the
defendant
relied
on
commonwealth
versus
soares
and
people
versus
wheeler,
the
local
state
cases
that
had
utilized
a
sixth
amendment
claim
because
they
couldn't
rely
on
fourteenth
amendment
under
swain.
so,
it
was
presented
as
sixth
amendment.
and
it's...
it's
an
appropriate
sixth
amendment
case
because
it
presents
all
of
the
harm
that
the
equal
protection
cases
condemn,
plus
additional
harm
that
the
sixth
amendment
cases
protect.
therefore,
this...
this
court
can
utilize
the
sixth
amendment
to
demonstrate
that
white
defendants
are
entitled
to
complain
if
they
have
evidence
that
they
offer
that
members
of
the
black
community,
the
distinctive
group
of
blacks,
are
being
removed
on
the
grounds
of
race.
and,
again,
if
the
defendant
is
unable
to
succeed
in
either
of
those
points,
then
he
would
not
prevail.
so
this
is
simply
giving
the
defendant
the
remedy
to
deal
with
an
issue
that
he
is
now
powerless
to
raise.
in
the
lockhart
case,
the
court
assumed
that
the
defendant
was
able
to
point
to
a
particular
group,
that
the
particular
group
had
certain
immutable
characteristics
of
race,
of
gender,
of
ethnic
background.
it
cited
blacks,
women
and
mexican-americans.
so,
those
are
indications
of
the
types
of
groups
that
this
court
would
protect.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes,
because
the
defendant
was
white.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
in
the
illinois
supreme
court.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
no.
we
didn't
pursue
the
batson
argument
because
we...
we
have
concluded
that
we
lacked
the
standing.
but
that
shouldn't
prevail...
that
hopefully
will
not
dissuade
the
court
if
it
prefers
to
use
an
equal
protection
result.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
well,
we
didn't--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--we
haven't
argued
it.
no.
but
the...
but
we've
argued
that
the
essence
of
the
objection,
or
of
the
problem
in
the
case
is
an
equal
protection.
but
we've
put
it
in
the
context
of
a
sixth
amendment
right.
so,
the
issue
of
a
denial
of
equal
protection
has
been
presented
because
blacks
are
being
removed
on
grounds
of
race.
but
we've
presented
as
a
remedy,
a
sixth
amendment
contention
because
that
harms
the
jury
selection
system
which
the
defendant
does
have
standing
to
raise.
so,
the
difficulty
also,
of
course,
is
that
this
court
decided
batson--
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
--yes.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
well,
the
impact
on
the
defendant
of
a
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause
would
be
a
sixth
amendment
violation
because
he
has
an
interest
in
his
jury
serving
as
the
conscience
of
the
community
which
is
denied
if
the
fair
possibility
of
the
cross-section
is
frustrated.
and
the
equal
protection
argument
would
concentrate
on
the
interests
of
the
juror,
which
being
of
the
same
race,
he
had
the
authority
to...
to
contend
or
to
challenge.
so,
this
is
a
broader
issue
because
there
are
broader
interests
at
stake
of
a
defendant
to
have
his
jury
chosen
and
serve
in
a
fair
system.
so,
because
of
the
emphasis
that
this
court
has
put
on
the
process
of
choosing
the
jurors,
that
this
court
must
have
equal
concern
with
the
process
of
choosing
the
petit
jurors.
that
if
this
court
means
to
make
meaningful
its
emphasis
on
the
fair
selection
process,
it
must
do
as
well
on
the
petit
jury
because
that's
the
only
jury
that
counts
as
far
as
the
defendant
is
concerned.
so
we
do
ask
your
honors
then
to
recognize
the
right
whenever
a
defendant,
whatever
his
race,
demonstrates
that
members
of
the
black
community
are
being
removed
on
grounds
of
their
membership
on
the
false
assumption
that
because
they're
black
they're
unqualified
to
serve
in
a
case,
that
he
be
able
to
make
an
objection,
attain
a
hearing,
and
prevail
on
his
grounds.
i
would
request
the
rest
of
my
time
be
reserved
for
rebuttal,
but
we
do
ask
your
honors
for
the
relief
sought.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
right
of
the
defendant,
or
the
expectation
of
the
defendant
has
been
well-expressed
during
respondent's
argument,
but
this
court
must
assure
that
whatever
the
luck
of
the
draw,
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
a
fair
process
which
permits
the
fair
cross-section
as
much
as
humanly
and
legally
possible
to
reach
the
issue...
to
reach
the
jury.
this
court
has
never
focused
merely
on
the
end
result.
it
has
looked
to
the
process
involved
because
that's
valuable.
this
court
has
never
merely
assumed
the
sixth
amendment
is
satisfied
by
an
impartial
jury
or
a
fair
trial
because
that
doesn't
assure
that
there's
a
fair
system
involved.
all
we're
asking
is
a
system
that,
as
with
blacks,
allows
white
defendants
to
complain
of
the
arbitrary
exclusion
of
blacks
on
grounds
of
race.
it's
a
very
simple
system,
it's
been
used
in
batson.
the
courts
are
familiar
with
it.
it
can
be
used
throughout
the
system.
and,
in
fact,
if
there
is
both
a
black
defendant
and
a
white
defendant,
it
solves
the
nagging
question
of
how
the
prosecutors
can
proceed
in
that
case.
so,
it
does
permit
the...
the
last
possibility
of
any
prosecutor
being
in
control
of
the
system.
and
the
state
seems
to
think
that
as
long
as
all
the
members
of
the
community
are
placed
at
the
outset,
then
the
government
is
no
longer
in
control
of
the
system.
in
fact,
they
do
remain
in
control
over
the
system
because
they
have
that
unconstitutional
peremptory
challenge.
that
wild
card
that
they
can
use
to
totally
frustrate
the
rights
of
the
defendant
which
he
has
standing
to
object
to
under
the
sixth
amendment,
and
the
will
of
this
court
that
the
processes
assure
the
fair
possibility
that
the
cross-section
will
reach
the
petit
jury.
many
of
the
concerns
of
the
state
that
they
admit
today
exist
in
trials
of
black
defendants.
well,
here
is
a
demonstration
that
a
black
is
unfit
to
serve,
and
this
has
impact
on
blacks,
and
it
has
impact
on
whites.
mr.
donald
s.
honchell
thank
you,
your
honor.
