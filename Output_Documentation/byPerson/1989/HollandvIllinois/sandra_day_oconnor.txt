justice
o'connor
you're
not
making
a
claim
here,
i
take
it,
that
there
is
some
systematic
exclusion
of
black
jurors
throughout
the
county?
justice
o'connor
that
claim
would
be
open
to
you
under
existing
precedence,
presumably,
if
the
facts
warranted
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
it
might
be
a
due
process
violation
if
the
judge
did
such
an
aberrational
thing.
clearly
not
authorized
under
state
or
federal
law
for
the
judge
to
do
that.
