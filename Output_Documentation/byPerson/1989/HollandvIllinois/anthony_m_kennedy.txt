justice
kennedy
incidentally,
in
your
hypothetical
i
noticed
you
used
martial
status
and
wealth
as
being
permitted
grounds
for
disqualification.
justice
kennedy
it
certainly
could
be
argued
that
those
are
cognizable
groups
that
come
within
the
rule
that
you
seek--
justice
kennedy
--to
have
the
court
adopt--
justice
kennedy
--is
it
not?
justice
kennedy
well,
how
can
we
do
that?
what
principle
could
you
recommend
to
us
or
propose
that
allows
us
to
say
that
only
blacks
are
protected
by
the
fair
cross-section
requirement?
justice
kennedy
well,
that
gets
back
to
justice
white's
original
question,
that
this
isn't
the
fair
cross-section
argument
you're
making
at
all.
it's
simply
an
equal
protection
argument.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
the
argument
is
not
that
there
is
an
obligation
to
excuse
in
order
to
get
a
fair
cross-section.
it's
simply
that
the
state
violates
the
sixth
amendment
because
it,
by
its
racially-based
challenges,
destroys
the
possibility
that
the
laws
of
probability
are
going
to
work
to...
to
produce
a
fair
cross-section.
that's
all
the
petitioner
is
saying
here.
justice
kennedy
the
petitioner
is
not
saying
that
there
is
an
obligation
in
every
case
to
use
peremptory
challenges
to
secure
a
fair
cross-section,
simply
that
the
state
cannot
by
interference
prevent
the
laws
of
probability
from...
from
operating.
