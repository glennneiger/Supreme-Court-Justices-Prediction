ms.
inge
fryklund
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
presented
today
is
whether
the
sixth
amendment
regulates
the
use
of
peremptory
challenges
during
voir
dire.
our
position
is
that
it
does
not.
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
the
right
to
trial
by
jury,
which
as
this
court
has
said
in
numerous
decisions,
the
fundamental
purpose
of
trial
by
jury
is
to
prevent
oppression
by
the
government.
and,
furthermore,
we're
guaranteed
not
only
this
trial
by
jury,
but
trial
specifically
by
an
impartial
jury.
so,
i
believe
the
focus
of
the
sixth
amendment
is
on
this
end
result
of
an
impartial
jury.
counsel
suggested
in
the
course
of
his
argument
today
that
the
outcome
of
the
composition
of
the
jury
is
somehow
less
important
than
the
process
and
that
this
court
should
be
focusing
primarily
on
process.
i
think
that
that
is
absolutely
incorrect.
we
must
always
be
looking
at
the
touchstone
of
the
sixth
amendment,
which
is
the
impartial
jury.
the
sixth
amendment
purposes
of
achieving
an
impartial
jury
are
achieved
in
practice
by
a
sequence
of
stages
that
begins
with
the
broadly-based
jury
pool
which
must
be
drawn
from
a
cross-section
of
the
community.
and
the
process
ends
sometime
later
in
an
individual
courtroom
in
which
a
prosecutor
and
an
individual
defendant
and
his
attorney...
two
adversaries...
are
mutually
engaged
in
the
process
of
picking
an
impartial
jury
of
six,
or,
as
in
illinois,
12
jurors.
and
the
choices
at
all
stages
of
the
process
are,
of
course,
constrained
by
the
equal
protection
clause.
now,
the
broad...
we
believe
that
the
very
broad
mix
of
all
the
distinctive
groups
on
the
jury
pool
is
directly
and
casually
related
to
the
overriding
purpose
of
preventing
oppression
by
the
government.
given
that
it's
the
government
which
by
definition
is
a
party
to
every
criminal
case,
which
is
solely
in
control
of
all
the
mechanisms
of
jury
summoning
and
recruitment,
it
is
vital
that
the
government
not
be
able
to
manipulate
or
gerrymander
the
jury
pool.
thus,
at
the
time
the
government
is
making
its
decision
to
indict,
which
usually
comes
some
weeks
or
even
months
ahead
of
the
actual
trial
date,
the
government
is
constrained
in
making
its
charging
decision
by
the
knowledge
that
it
has
no
control
over
who
is
going
to
be
able
to
appear
on
the
venire,
and
potentially
any
member
of
the
community
could
appear
to
try
the
case.
i
think
this
is
why
even
if
the
particular
defendant
ultimately
opts
for
a
bench
trial
this
broadly-based
jury
pool
has
served
a
very
vital
function
for
keeping
the
government
honest.
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
earlier,
if
the
jury
pool
is
broadly-based
with
nobody
in
particular
eliminated,
at
the
time
the
two
parties
reach
the
final
stage
of
voir
dire,
they're
both
on
a
level
playing
field.
neither
has
been
able
to
bias
the
direction
of
the
venire.
then,
when
the
trial
date
for
an
individual
case
arrives
and
the
two
individual
parties
enter
the
courtroom,
the
government
is
no
longer
in
control
of
the
process.
the
government
has
switched
hats.
now
the
government
is
one
party
in
a
particular
case.
and
at
this
stage
the
judge
exercises...
or,
removes
jurors
for
cause,
and
the
two
parties...
and
in
illinois
the
two
parties
have
the
same
number
of
peremptory
challenges,
it's
now
seven...
the
two
parties
jointly
act
to
pick
a
jury.
and
they
do
this
by
each
side
acts
to
remove
the
individual
people
whom
it
suspects
are
going
to
be
least
favorable
to
consideration
of
its
own
side.
it
is
our
position
that
at
this
stage,
in
the
midst
of
voir
dire,
that
the
demographic
composition
of
the
jury
which
is
ultimately
chosen,
or
the
composition
of
the
array
of
people
who
have
been
excused,
is
absolutely
irrelevant
to
any
purpose
which
is
protected
by
the
sixth
amendment.
therefore,
whether
petitioner
is
talking
about
having
a
quota
of
some
representatives
of
the
community
on
his
petit
jury
or,
as
he
spoke
in
his
brief,
about
a
fair
possibility
that
some
particular
distribution
would
obtain,
or
whether,
as
he
emphasized
in
argument
today,
that
we
have
to
look
to
someone's
motivation
for
particular
choices...
however
it
is
he
phrases,
we
believe
that
under
the
sixth
amendment
his
claim
fails
at
the
very
threshold
because
the
group
membership
of
individual
impartial
people
is
absolutely
irrelevant
to
anything
and
should
not
be
the
basis
for
a
cognizable
claim.
in
fact,
since
this
goal
of
impartiality
is
logically
independent
of
the
race,
socioeconomic
class,
ethnic
origin,
or
any
other
personal
characteristic
of
the
individual
jurors,
any
sort
of
rule
of
selection
or
any
prohibition
on
what
the
government
can
do
in
selection
that's
based
on
anything
other
than
impartiality
is
bound
to
go
counter
to
the
expressed
values
of
the
sixth
amendment
which
is
the
goal
of
impartiality.
so,
our
position
is
the
only
time
at
which
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
fair
cross-section
of
the
community
is
the
point
at
which
the
names
go
into
the
box
for
selecting
the
venires.
that's
the
end
of
it.
now,
coming
back
to
this
overriding
purpose
of
achieving
impartiality.
petitioner
holland
here
has
never
contended
that
there
was
anything
wrong
about
the
way
the
cook
county
jury
pool
was
selected,
and
he
has
never
contended
that
there
was
anything
impartial
about
the
jury
of
12
that
actually
convicted
him.
in
fact,
in
this
case,
given
that
he
had
five
peremptory
challenges
left
over
at
the
time
his
jury
was
sworn,
we
know
with
certainty
that
he
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
the
impartiality
of
his
jury.
what
he
is
telling
us
now
is
that
he
wants
not
just
impartiality,
but
impartiality
plus.
now,
plus
race,
ethnic
origin,
whatever.
and
i
submit
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
sixth
amendment
that
entitles
him
to
impartiality--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--well,
he's
certainly
saying
that
he
wants
to
restrict
this
to
defendants.
i
mean...
sorry...
just
to
the
prosecutors.
but,
as
justice
white's
questions
earlier
pointed
out,
logically
if
this
can
apply
in
a
civil
case
in
which
both
sides
are
private
citizens,
that
same
rationale
should
certainly
apply
to
the
defendant
here.
in
fact,
it
would
be
rather
strange
to
have
a
procedure
which
constrained
the
government
in
a
way
which
was
on
some
basis
other
than
impartiality
and
yet
did
not
in
a
comparable
way
constrain
the
defense.
almost
by
definition
we
would
end
up
with
something
which
was
less
impartial
than
before.
and
it
seems
very
inconsistent
for
this
court
to
require
something
that's
guaranteed
to
reduce
impartiality.
ms.
inge
fryklund
that
sounds
like
virginia
versus...
ex
parte
virginia
from
back
in
1879
when
in
that
case
a
particular
district
judge
refused
to
call
any
black
jurors
for
the
jury
pool.
i
think
the
same
rationale
would
hold
here.
if--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--no,
because
the
equal
protection
clause
applies
at
all
stages
and
a
trial
judge--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--i
think
a
white
defendant
would
not
be
able
to
object
to
that.
ms.
inge
fryklund
this
would
not
be
the
means
for
attacking
the
problem.
ms.
inge
fryklund
the
remedy
would
not
be
found--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--well,
that
would
be
in
violation
of
federal
and
probably
state
law
right
now.
the
excluded
jurors,
as
a
class,
could
easily
bring
a
suit.
ms.
inge
fryklund
i
think
there
certainly
would
be
a
cause
of
action
that
the
excluded
class
of
black
jurors,
which,
by
hypothesis,
there
must
be
a
large
number--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--i
do
not
think...
the
sixth
amendment
would
not
reach
it,
and
i
do
not
think
that
a
white
defendant
in
a
particular
trial,
if
he
was
getting
an
impartial
jury,
would
have
standing...
he
would
not
have
equal
protection
standing.
ms.
inge
fryklund
well,
in
the
previous
decisions
of
this
court,
class
has
always
referred
to
race,
and
the
defendant
in
batson
did
have
the
same
race
standing.
he
was
the
same
race
as
the
excluded
jurors,
which
is
a
fairly
traditional
basis
for
third
party
standing...
that
he
is
not
only
similar
and
can
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
excluded
jurors,
but
he
also
suffers,
i
think,
some
injury
in
fact
to
himself
as
he,
a
black
defendant,
is
standing
there
watching
members
of
his
race
being
shown
the
door.
that
also
provides
a
signal
to
the
impanelled
white
jurors
that
this
person...
people
like
the
excused
jurors,
black
people,
are
not
terribly
important
in
the
eyes
of
the
legal
system.
so,
he
has
an
injury
which
is
personal
to
him
as
well
as
third
party
standing.
a
white
defendant
has
no
such
interest.
so,
our
position
here
is
that
petitioner
holland
got
exactly
what
the
sixth
amendment
promises
him.
this
is
why
we
think
that
even
though
he
has
denominated
this
claim
as
a
sixth
amendment
claim,
he
really
is
not
making
a
sixth
amendment
claim
at
all,
as
justice
white
suggested
earlier.
what
petitioner
holland
appears
to
be
doing
is
attacking
by
the
back
door
the
standing
requirement
of
the
equal
protection
clause.
in
fact,
as
he
specifically
asks
at
page
6
of
his
brief,--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--if
nothing
else,
if
petitioner
were
to
approach
the
problem
through
the
equal
protection
clause,
jurisprudentially
it's
cleaner
than
what
he
is
trying
under
the
sixth
amendment.
i
think
the
reason
it
should
fail
on
the
merits
is
because
that
would
amount
to
saying
everybody
has
standing
to
complain
about
everything,
and
that
is
going
to
involve
overturning
an
awful
lot
of
standing
jurisprudence
of
this
court.
other
contexts
such
as--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--well,
consider
the
fourth
amendment,
search
and
seizure,
that
it's
always
been
held
that
a
criminal
defendant
who
wants
to
have
something
suppressed
is
going
to
have
to
assert
an
interest
in
either
the
thing
that's
been
seized
or
the
premises
that
were
searched.
if
we--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--i
think
that's
what
the
theory
was.
that
there
was
some--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--whether
he
might
have
thought
that
blacks
were
going
to
favor
him
or
not,
i
mean,
i
think
that
thus
far
has
not
been
an
interest
this
court
has
been
willing
to
protect.
i
think
it's
more
the
stigma
of
the
system
telling
black
jurors
that
they
don't
quality
and
telling--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--because
in
the
situation
involving
a
black
defendant
there
is
not
only
third-party
standing
on
behalf
of
the
excluded
people
but
he
has
his
own
injury.
and
in
general--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--the...
i
think
the
injury
is
the
signal
to
him
that
the...
that
the
system
does
not
value
him
too
highly
if
it
removes
all
members
of
his
raise,
and
the
possibility
of
conveying
the
idea
to
the
impanelled
jurors
that
maybe
they
shouldn't
take
this
black
defendant
too
seriously.
thought
it
should
be
noted
that
in
the
batson
case
i
think
there
was
also
no
claim
that
the
actual
jury
that
tried
him
was
not
impartial.
so,
the
equal
protection
clause
is
dealing
with
something
other
than
impartiality.
unless
petitioner
would
urge
this
court
to
go
the
equal
protecting...
the
equal
protection
standing
route,
what
he
has
left
us
with
under
a
sixth
amendment
analysis
is
something
which
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
put
into
practice,
as
well
as
totally
unnecessary.
when
he
talks
about,
as
he
does
in
his
brief,
about
how
he
would
settle
for
merely
a
fair
possibility
of
a
fair
cross-section
actually
appearing
on
his
petit
jury,
the
question
is
how
to
operationalize
that
so
that
any
attorney...
whether
defense
attorney
or
prosecutor...
and
the
trial
judge
will
know
when
a
fair
possibility
has
been
violated
or
hasn't.
at
the
level
of
the
jury
pool,
we
know
that
by
definition
there
is
a
fair
possibility
if
in
fact
no
distinctive
group
has
been
excluded.
and
we
test
that
by
looking
over
some
period
of
time
to
see
if
the
composition
of
the
jury
pools
matches
the
composition
of
the
community.
but
petitioner
is
apparently
looking
for
something
in
addition
that
would
be
enforceable
right
on
the
petit
jury.
now,
i
would
think
the...
perhaps
the
logical
way
to
approach
that
would
be
to
look
at
the
composition
of
petit
juries
over
time.
that,
over
a
period
of
six
months,
looking
to
see
if
the
jurors
who
actually
serve
somehow
match
the
demographic
distribution
in
the
county...
that
is
something
that
would
be
possible
to
do.
in
effect,
that's
recreating
the
swain
rule,
but
under
the
sixth
amendment.
but
it
does
have
the
advantage
of
the
certain
logic
that
it's
a
way
of
testing
what
he
says
he's
looking
for.
if
he
doesn't
go
to
some
such
long-term
swain
type
rule
or
switch
to
a
batson
type
rule
where
he
substitutes
the
invidious
intent
of
the
equal
protection
clause
for
disparity
in
numbers,
we
end
up
with
something
which
is
unintelligible
and
unenforceable.
in
this
particular
case
there
were
two
black
jurors
excused.
that's
all
we
can
say
looking
at
it.
there
is...
there
is
no
theoretical
content
to
that.
cook
county,
which
is
approximately
26
percent
black
on
the
voter
lists...
this
should
mean
that
in
a
cook
county
jury
the
ideal
would
be
three
black
people
on
it.
and
suppose
in
a
particular
voir
dire
the
state
excused
two
blacks,
as
in
this
case,
and
impanelled
two,
how
would
we
ever
know
which
of
those
two
choices
was
wrongful?
what
would
the
the
trial
judge
do
in
order
to
manage
voir
dire?
so,
anything
which
does
not
require
actual
impaling
of
a
full
cross-section
on
the
petit
jury
is
left
in
complete
limbo.
nobody
knows
whether
the
choice
has
violated
the
sixth
amendment
or
it
doesn't.
the
prosecutor
can
go
home
every
night
wondering
if
he
has
violated
the
sixth
amendment.
an
additional
problem
with
the
analysis
that
petitioner
is
suggesting
here
is
that
i
assume
that
this
would
be
in
effect
at
the
same
time
the
batson
rule
is
in
effect.
batson
can
be
claimed
by
a
black
defendant.
the
sixth
amendment
claim
must
be
one
which
could
be
claimed
by
anybody,
and
i
can
foresee
a
lot
of
times
when
there
would
be
a
tension
between
what
the
equal
protection
clause,
as
effectuated
by
the
batson
rule,
requires,
and
what
a
sixth
amendment
rule
would
require.
for
example,
in
this
case
it
would
be
possible
for
the
trial
judge
to
conclude,
even
if
this
was
a
black
defendant
here,
that
there
was
no
violation
of
the
equal
protection
clause,
that
there
were
some
race-neutral
reasons.
but,
at
the
same
time,
this
petition
kept
urging
back
in
1981
at
the
time
of
his
trial
that
these
were
the...
quote...
"only
two
available
black
people".
so,
an
argument
could
be
made
that
we
would
have
to
impanel
these
two.
there
is
also
a
very
different
standard
under
the
equal
protection
clause
in
the
sixth
amendment.
the
equal
protection--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--uh-huh.
ms.
inge
fryklund
if
he
were
a--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--black
defendant,
he
could
ask
the
particular
people
not
be
excused
under
batson.
ms.
inge
fryklund
or
maybe
he
could
plead
in
the
alternative.
[laughter]
or
do
we
allow
a
defendant
to--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--or
another
possibility
is
if,
suppose
it
happens
to
be
a
venire
which
is
predominantly
black,
as
sometimes
happens
by
the
luck
of
the
draw
in
cook
county.
we
could
end
up
with
six
black
people
on
the
venire.
the
prosecutor
who
then
excused
three
of
them
in
an
effort
to
obtain
a
distribution
that
more
closely
approximated
cook
county,
would
be
excusing
people
specifically
on
the
basis
of
race
which
presumably
would
violate
batson.
but
it
might
be
absolutely
necessary
to
avoid
too
many
of
some...
too
few
of
some
other
category.
and
it
might
be
required
under
the
sixth
amendment.
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
situations
in
which
there
would
be
attention
between
the
two.
ms.
inge
fryklund
well,
unless--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--well,
unless
what
petitioner
is
making
is
a
heads
i
win,
tails
you
lose,
sort
of
argument
that
if
there
are
six
black
potential
jurors
who
appear,
if
there
are
that
many,
we
are
obligated
to
keep
them,
we
can't
reduce
the
number.
but
if
we
are
thinking
seriously
about
a
fair
cross-section
in
which
every
distinctive
group
in
the
community
has...
should
have
a
fair
possibility
of
being
there,
i
think
that
a
prosecutor
under
a
sixth
amendment
constraint
would
be
entitled
to
try
to
produce
something
the
closest
to
the
community
that
he
could.
and
it
seems
that
when
petitioner
is
just
talking
about
how
we
can't...
perhaps
what
he's
saying
is
simply
that
we
can't
alter
whatever
it
is
that
comes
in
the
door.
for
that
proposition,
i
see
no
support
in
either
the
equal
protection
clause
or
the
sixth
amendment.
in
fact,
that
would
be
saying
that
whatever
distribution
by
the
luck
of
the
draw
is
sent
from
the
jury
room
today...
those
40
people...
i
can't
use
a
choice
which
is
going
to
alter
that
distribution,
whatever
it
happens
to
be.
ms.
inge
fryklund
again,
those
are
equal
protection
ideas.
if
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
consistent
sixth
amendment
position
in
which
we
have
whatever
comes
in
the
door,
if
we
are
exercising
peremptory
challenges
for
proper
reasons
to--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--well,
we
think--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--we
think
the
sixth
amendment
cross-sectional
principle
is
fully
satisfied
at
the
time
the
jury
pool
is
fairly
drawn
and
the
venire
is
fairly
dispatched--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--from
the
jury
room.
and
that
that's
the
end
of
it.
beyond
that--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--beyond
that,
peremptory
challenges
should
be
exercised
and
i
think
constrained
only
by
the
equal
protection
clause
by
the
two
adversary
partier
doing
their
best
to
impanel
a
jury
that's
going
to
give
favorable
consideration
to
their
position.
ms.
inge
fryklund
usually
we
do
it
that
way,
yes.
ms.
inge
fryklund
i
think
that
would
probably
raise
a
due
process
concern.
ms.
inge
fryklund
i
don't
think
so.
no.
ms.
inge
fryklund
a
fair
trial--
ms.
inge
fryklund
--what
defendant
is
entitled
to
and
what
petitioner
holland
got
here
is
a
fair
trial.
ms.
inge
fryklund
that
is
everything
that
he
is
entitled
to.
while
petitioner
is
asking
for
an
elaborate
remedy
which
has
some
base
and
some
combination
of
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
sixth
amendment,
we
believe
there
is
no
necessity
of
this
at
all.
and
given
that
this
court
cannot
impose
new
procedures
or
constraints
on
the
states
unless
we're
in
violation
of
the
federal
constitution,
and
petitioner
here
has
failed
to
demonstrate
how
the
sixth
amendment
is
violated
by
this,
the
state
of
illinois
asks
that
this
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
illinois.
