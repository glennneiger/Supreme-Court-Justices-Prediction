justice
white
well,
would
you
say
a
prosecutor
could
challenge
two
black
jurors
out
of
six
black
jurors?
say
there
is
a
12-man...
12-person
jury
and
six
of
the...
six
of
the
jurors
drawn
from
the...
six
of
the
petit
jurors
drawn
are
black,
could
the
prosecutor
strike
two
of
them
as
long
as
the
resulting
jury
represented
a
cross...
a
fair
cross-section?
justice
white
no.
that's
not
a
fair
cross-section
argument.
that's
an
equal
protection
argument
of
some
kind,
isn't
it?
justice
white
but
what
if
the
prosecutor
says,
i'm
interested
in
having
a
fair
cross-section
jury?
all
the...
all
the...
suppose
just
by
chance
the
jury
turned
out
to
be
all
black?
i
want
a
fair
cross-section
jury.
could
he
do
that
or
not?
i
guess
not,
on
your
thesis.
justice
white
with
respect
to
the
venire.
justice
white
i
suppose
you
would
apply
this
same
approach
to
civil
trials
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
white
how
about
the
seventh
amendment?
justice
white
certainly
there
is
a
right
to
a
jury
trial.
justice
white
in
the
federal
courts.
justice
white
well,
i
know.
but
your
rationale
would
surely
apply.
nobody
should
be
able
to
take
a
person
off
the
jury
on
some...
just
because
he
figures
any
member
of
this
group
is
incompetent.
justice
white
what
do
you
think
the
theory
in
batson
is
that
permits
the
black
defendant
to
challenge
the
use
of
peremptories
against
blacks?
is
that
an
equal
protection
argument?
justice
white
the
denial
of
equal
protection
to
the
defendant?
justice
white
well,
why
shouldn't...
why
shouldn't
a...
why
shouldn't
a
white
defendant
have
that
same
privilege
and
without
even
getting
to
the
fair
cross-section
argument?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
he's...
he's
a
defendant
and
that's
all
you're
really
saying
about
the
black,
is
that
he's
a
defendant
and
you're
giving
him
standing
to
remedy
this
denial
of
equal
protection
to
the
juror.
justice
white
if
that's
your...
that's
your
theory?
justice
white
it
sounds
to
me
that
that
might
be
an
easier
argument
than
the--
justice
white
--you're
driving
uphill
in
this
case.
justice
white
well,
didn't
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
this
case
say
that
batson
did
not
apply
in
this
situation?
justice
white
yes.
so,
the
batson
issue
was
raised
and
decided
in
the
illinois
supreme
court.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
it's
raised--
justice
white
--and
it
was
decided.
justice
white
are
you
relying
on
it
here?
justice
white
supposing
he
is
and
suppose
we
accept
that...
even
this
back
door
approach,
then
what's
your
answer
to
the
argument
that
the
white
defendant
should
have
standing
to
attack
the
discriminatory
exclusion
of
the
black
juror
just
on
the
ground
that
blacks
are
incompetent?
justice
white
it
might
even
go
farther
than
the
sixth
amendment
approach.
justice
white
what
do
you
think
the
theory
of
batson
was?
is
it
the...
is
it
that
the
defendant
has
been
denied
equal
protection?
justice
white
namely
that...
that...
that
blacks
were
excluded
and
that's
going
to
hurt
him
because
blacks
might
favor
him,
or
what?
justice
white
well,
what
difference
does
it
make
what...
what
defendant
raises
that
issue?
justice
white
which
is...
which
is
what?
what
is
his
own
injury?
justice
white
well,
you...
that
isn't
right.
surely
there
would
be
some
case-related
reasons
that
could
be
used
in
exercising
your
peremptories
without
any
challenge
to
them.
it's
just
you
couldn't
alter
the
luck
of
the
draw
by
striking
people
for
unacceptable
reasons
like
race
or
like
gender
or
something
like
that.
justice
white
yeah,
but
all
you
get...
all
you're
entitled
to
under
the
sixth
amendment
is
a
chance
of
the
draw
and...
so
the
draw
comes
out.
here
it
is.
it
may
not
even
remotely
resemble
a
fair
cross-section.
but
that's
the
luck
of
the
draw
and
you're
stuck
with
it
except
to
the
extent
that
you
can
exercise
your
peremptories
for
decent
reasons.
justice
white
that's
a
sixth
amendment
argument.
justice
white
right.
justice
white
--if
all
the
men
were
on
the
jury
or
all--
justice
white
--yeah.
