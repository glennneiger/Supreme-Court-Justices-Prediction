justice
scalia
does
this
objection
apply
only
to
racial
distinctions?
justice
scalia
of
course,
one
way...
one
easy
way
of
limiting
it
is
to...
automatically
is
to
say
that
only
blacks--
justice
scalia
--can
object
to
the
elimination
of
blacks.
that...
that...
that
you
know--
justice
scalia
--that
eliminates
a
lot
of
problems,
doesn't
it?
but
you're
saying
anybody
can
object
to
the
elimination
of
any
group,
right?
justice
scalia
right.
and
i
suppose
rich
people
could
object
to
the
exclusion
of
rich
people.
not
only
the...
i
mean,
could
object...
not
only
to
the
exclusion
of
rich
people,
but
even
to
the
exclusion
of
poor
people.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
what
are...
what
are
false
assumptions?
you
say
false
assumptions.
when
you're
talking
about
a
venire,
i...
i
suppose
you
can
say
there
are
false
assumptions
when
you're
talking
about
any
group.
you...
the
only
basis
for
excluding
is
you
think
that
they're...
they're
too
biased
or
too
stupid
or
something
else,
to
be
jurors
at
all.
but
when
you're
down
to
a
particular
case,
what
is
wrong
with
a
prosecutor
striking
a
particular
people
because
they're
rich?
i
mean,
the
prosecutor
says,
these
are
rich
defendants;
i
think
i'd
stand
a
better
chance
of
getting
a...
getting
a
conviction
if
i
excluded
rich
people,
if
i
had
a
poor-person
jury.
the
prosecutors
make
judgments
like
that
all
the
time.
justice
scalia
so
it's
not
a
false
assumption
then.
justice
scalia
he
doesn't
exclude
that
at
all...
that
isn't
his
assumption
at
all.
his
assumption
is
the
chances
are
better
than
even.
it's
not
at
all...
the
chances
are
better
than
even
that
a...
that
a
rich
person
will
be
more
sympathetic
to
a
rich
defendant
and
he
therefore
wants
to
strike
the
person.
isn't
that
exactly
what...
what
peremptory
challenges
are
all
about?
justice
scalia
if
you're
really...
if
you're
really
honest
about
your
principle,
peremptory
challenges
in
general...
the
whole
notion
of
a
peremptory
challenge
is
contrary
to
having
a
fair
cross-section,
isn't
it,
because
the
whole
purpose
of
it
is
to
eliminate
a
fair
cross-section
and
somehow
load
the
jury
in
such
a
way
that
it's
more
likely
to
be
in
your
favor.
isn't
that
exactly
what
a
peremptory
challenge
is
for?
justice
scalia
that
stretches
what
we've
said
so
far.
i
mean,
it
certainly
would
be
a
rational
system
to
say
that
you
have
to
have
a
fair
cross-section
for
the
venire
simply
to
make
sure
that
both
sides
enter
into
this
lottery
that
is
peremptory
challenges
on
a
fair
basis,
a
level
playing
field.
you
start
off
with
a
venire
that
is
a
fair
cross-section.
after
that,
each
side
gets
its
peremptories.
we're
not
insisting
that
a
fair
cross-section
come
out
of
the
thing.
that's
very
unlikely
with
only
12
people
on
the
jury
anyway.
justice
scalia
but
you've
got
to
start
off
with
a
venire
of
a
fair
cross
section
and
then
each
side
can
then
use
its
peremptories
the
way
peremptories
are
always
used
on
generalized
group
bases.
i
mean,
that's
how
peremptories
are
used.
why
isn't
that
a
perfectly
rational
system?
i
mean,
it
doesn't
logically
follow
that
just
because
we
say
the
venire
has
to
be
a
fair
cross-section
the
jury
has
to
be.
justice
scalia
no.
the
purpose
is
to
make
sure
that
both
sides
start
off
on
a
level
playing
field.
justice
scalia
after
which
they
can
both
take
their
peremptories--
justice
scalia
--anyway
they
want.
justice
scalia
well,
he's
not
really
saying
that.
he's
saying
plus
the
inclusion
of
all
those
races
that
he
wants
included.
he's
not
been
willing
to
extend
this
principle
to
the
defendant,
or
at
least
leaves
that
an
open
question.
he
just
wants
us
to
hold
that
the
prosecutor
can't
exclude
certain
groups
on
the
basis
of
their
group
characteristics
although
the
defendant
still
can,
as
far
as
his
case
goes.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
which
upheld
the
petitioner’s
conviction
of
aggravated
kidnapping,
rape,
deviant
sexual
assault,
and
armed
robbery.
the
preliminary
question
it
presents
is
whether
a
white
criminal
defendant
has
standing
to
contest
the
preemptory
challenge
of
blacks
from
his
jury
as
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
our
previous
cases
established
that
every
criminal
defendant
has
standing
under
the
sixth
amendment
to
object
to
the
selection
of
his
jury
from
a
venire
from
the
jury
pool
that
is
not
designed
to
represent
a
fair-cross-section
of
the
community.
although
this
petitioner
seeks
to
extend
the
fair-cross-section
requirement
from
the
venire
to
the
petit
jury
itself,
that
does
not
affect
his
standing
to
press
his
claim
so
we
hold
that
he
does
have
standing.
while
agreeing
with
him
on
the
standing
point,
however,
we
do
not
agree
with
his
position
on
the
merits
that
the
sixth
amendment’s
fair-cross-section
requirement
applies
to
the
petit
jury
as
opposed
to
the
venire.
the
text
of
the
sixth
amendment
guarantees
criminal
defendants
a
right
not
to
a
representative
jury
but
to
an
impartial
jury.
at
the
venire
stage,
the
fair-cross-section
requirement
is
necessary
to
achieve
that
end.
without
such
a
requirement,
the
state
would
be
able
to
draw
up
jury
lists
so
as
to
produce
a
pool
of
perspective
jurors
disproportionately
ill-disposed
against
one
or
all
classes
of
defendants
stacking
the
decks,
sort
of
speak,
in
the
state’s
favor.
the
fair-cross-section
venire
requirement
thus,
assures
that
in
selecting
the
jury,
the
prosecution
and
the
defendant
will
compete
on
an
equal
basis.
extending
the
fair-cross-section
requirement
to
the
petit
jury,
however,
would
undermine
rather
than
further
the
sixth
amendment’s
goal
of
impartiality
because
it
would
cripple
the
institution
of
preemptory
challenges.
preemptory
challenges
enable
each
side
to
exclude
those
jurors
it
believes
will
be
most
partial
to
the
other
side.
although
petitioner’s
objection
in
the
present
case
relates
to
the
striking
of
blacks,
the
sixth
amendment
claim,
as
opposed
to
a
fourteenth
amendment
claim
which
was
not
presented
here,
would
be
just
as
strong
if
he
had
objected
to
the
exclusion
of
any
number
of
other
identifiable
groups,
postmen
or
lawyers
or
clergymen.
preventing
such
generalizations
in
that
preemptory
challenge
process
would
obviously
destroy
an
institution.
that
institution
was
part
of
the
traditional
understanding
of
how
an
impartial
jury
was
composed
at
the
time
the
sixth
amendment
was
adapted,
and
therefore,
any
theory
of
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
an
impartial
jury
that
would
affectively
forbid
the
use
of
preemptory
challenges
is
implausible.
in
this
court,
the
petitioner
raised
only
a
sixth
amendment
claim.
thus,
we
do
not
hold
that
the
systematic
exclusion
of
blacks
from
petit
juries
to
preemptory
challenges
is
lawful
under
the
equal
protection
clause,
it
obviously
is
not.
nor
do
we
hold
that
this
white
defendant
does
not
have
a
valid
constitutional
challenge
to
such
racial
exclusion
of
blacks
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
all
that
we
do
hold
is
that
he
does
not
have
a
valid
constitutional
challenge
based
on
the
sixth
amendment.
the
judgment
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
is
therefore
affirmed.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan
and
blackmun
have
joined;
justice
stevens
has
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
