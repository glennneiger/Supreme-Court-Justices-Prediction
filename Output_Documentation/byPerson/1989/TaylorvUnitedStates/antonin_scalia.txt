justice
scalia
excuse
me,
it
was
entering
or...
and
it's
the
government's
proposed
definition,
too,
isn't
it?
entering
or
remaining
surreptitiously?
justice
scalia
does
the
surreptitiously
go
only
with
the
remaining
or
does
it
go
with
the
entering,
too?
justice
scalia
most
shoplifters
don't
sneak
in.
i
mean
they
sort
of
walk
in
and
then...
i
don't
think
it
would
cover--
justice
scalia
--well,
then
any...
any
crime
you
commit
in
a
building
would
be
burglary?
justice
scalia
xxx.
justice
scalia
well,
excuse
me.
the
principle
would...
well...
that
depends
on
one
comes
out
on
the
other
issue.
but
you...
you...
you
maintain
that
the
way
we
have
to
decide
whether
your
client
has
been
convicted
of
burglary
or
not
is
not...
let's
assume
we
decide
that
burglary
has
to
be
in
a
building.
as
i
understand
it,
your
contention
is
that
we
would
not
look
to
the
particular
offense
that
he
committed
to
see
if
in
fact
he
was
in
a
building,
but
we
would
look
to
see
whether
the
element
of
the
crime...
the
elements
of
the
crime
of
which
he
was
convicted
under
state
law...
one
of
the
elements
was
being
in
a
building.
justice
scalia
now,
that
wouldn't
require
any
case-by-case
analysis.
and
that's--
justice
scalia
--we
would
just...
we
would
just
look
to
the
state's
statute.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
so
under
your...
your
own
test,
we're
not
confronting
a
problem
of...
of
uncertainty
here
if
we...
i
mean
there
may
be
other
problems
with
the
government's
position,
but
it's
not...
it's
not
the
difficulty
of
doing
case-by-case
analysis.
justice
scalia
even...
even
in
that
event,
we're
still
going
to
have
to
decide,
not
case
by
case
but
certainly
element
by
element,
which
particular
things
in
burglary
statutes
create
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
for
example,
does
nighttime
do
it
for
those
burglary
statutes
that
require
entering
a
building
by
night?
or,
for
that
matter,
does
the
requirement
of
a
building
that
belongs
to
another,
is
that
alone
enough?
and
it
may
well
be
that
after
applying
your
test,
we
could
very
well
end
up
right
where
the
government's
test
is,
by
your
root,
determining
that
every
element
the
government
would...
would
include
in
its
test,
is
indeed
the
sort
of
element
that
creates
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
justice
scalia
mr.
livingston,
the
"otherwise"
clause
doesn't
necessarily
mean...
doesn't
refer
necessarily
back
to
burglary
arson
or
extortion.
it
may
only
refer
back
to
the
immediately
preceding
phrase
which
is
"involves
use
of
explosives".
and,
indeed,
one
is
lead
to
believe
that
that's
what
it
refers
back
to
since
it
also
uses
the
word
"involves".
so
the
thing
reads,
is
burglary,
arson
or
extortion,
involves
use
of
explosives
or
otherwise
involves
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
injury.
it
seems
to
me
that
all
the
"otherwise"
is
attached
to
is
the
use
of
explosives,
not
the...
not
the
three
crimes
that
are
specifically
named.
justice
scalia
you'd
use
normal
principles
of...
of
use
of
legislative
history,
or
what
not...
i
would
assume
you
would
say,
whatever
it
means,
one
thing
we
know
it
doesn't
mean...
that
is,
what
they
defined
it
as
in...
in
1984
and
took
out.
justice
scalia
xxx.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
and
if...
and
if
you
do
not
do
it
case
by
case,
but
you
look
to
the
elements
of
the
offense
rather
than
to
the
actual
offense
that
occurred.
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
we'll
have
another
lawsuit
on...
on
that
one.
right?
justice
scalia
we'll
have
another
lawsuit
on
that
one
after
we--
justice
scalia
mr.
lazerwitz,
i
am
afraid
that
in
the
course
of
this
discussion,
we
not
only
have
not
come
closer
together,
we
seemed
to
have
walked
further
apart.
i
am
no
longer
sure
that...
that
the
two
sides
agree
on
the
basic
approach
to
applying
this
statute.
that
is,
i
think,
that
your
adversary
would
probably
say
that
what
he
means
by
applying
the
statute
generically
is,
if
the
burglary
statute
did
not
require
that
there
be
found
as
an
element
of
the
offense
the
particular
item
that's
included
in
the
definition...
building
or
at
night
or
whatever...
i
think
he'd
say
that
you
can't
count
it.
and
why
isn't
that
a
better
way?
why
isn't
that
a
better
way
to
do
it?
justice
scalia
why
isn't
it
written--
justice
scalia
--no,
but
that...
but...
but
you...
you
look
to
the
definition
of
the
crime
and
if
the
definition
of
the
crime
involves
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
injury,
then
that's
it.
justice
scalia
and...
and
if
that
element
has
to
be
found
in
order
to
convict
of
the
crime,
then...
then
it's
okay.
if
it
doesn't
have
to
be
found,
then
it's
not
okay.
justice
scalia
why?
because
all
state
burglary
statutes
are
so
expansive
and
include
so
many
things
in
them
that--
justice
scalia
--i'm
saying--
justice
scalia
--i'm
not
sure
you
are
understanding
what
i
think
is
a
difference
between
the
two
of
you.
i
agree
that
burglary
is
a
crime
under
the
statute.
you
don't
have
to
prove
separately
that
there
was
a
danger
to
another
person.
we
accept
your
definition,
let's
say.
it
requires
that
it
be
in
a
building.
what
i
believe
your
adversary
is
saying
is
that
means
if
you
have
a
state
which
has
a
definition
of
a
statute
that
says
it
is
burglary
if
it's
done
at
night
or
in
a
building,
you
would
not
be
able
to
use
that
for
purposes
of
this
statute
because
it
was
not
necessary
in
order
to
obtain
that
conviction,
to
prove
that
the
defendant
was
in
a
building.
you
might
have
proven,
instead,
that
it
was
at
night.
now,
why
isn't
that
a
very
sensible
way
of
applying
this
statute?
justice
scalia
mr.
lazerwitz,
i...
i
gather
from
what
you've
said
that
the
way...
the
way
the
department
interprets
this
statute
to
come
under
the
portion
that
says
"involves
use
of
explosives",
it
isn't
necessary
that
the
statute
be
a
statute
prohibiting
a
crime
with
the
use
of
explosives.
that
is,
you
could
get
somebody
if
they
were
convicted
of...
oh,
i
don't
know...
mayhem
by
the...
but
in
the
facts
of
the
case
they
did
it
by
use
of
explosives.
justice
scalia
and
you
would
do
that
for
the
last
clause
also,
"otherwise
it
presents
a
serious
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another?
"
justice
scalia
that
risk
of
physical
injury
must
be
in
the
statute...
not
the
exclusive
thing
in
the
statute?
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
are
arson
and
extortion
defined
in
this
statute,
or
can
we
look
forward
to
those
cases
coming
up
later?
