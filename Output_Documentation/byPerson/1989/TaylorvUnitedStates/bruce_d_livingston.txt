mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
statutory
interpretation
of
18
u.s.c.
924(e),
which
provides
for
a
mandatory
minimum
term
of
imprisonment
of
15
years
without
parole
to
persons
found
in
violation
of
section
922(g)
of
that
title
and
who
have
three
previous
convictions
for
a
violent
felony.
a
violent
felony
under
that
statute
is
defined
as
a
crime
punishable
by
a
term
of
imprisonment
exceeding
one
year
and
for
purposes
of
this
case
is
burglary,
arson,
or
extortion,
involves
use
of
explosives
or
otherwise
presents
a
risk
of
serious...
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
in
the
district
court,
for
purposes
of
facts
of
this
case,
the
court
relied
upon
four
felony
convictions,
two
of
which
we
do
not
contest,
but
two
of
which
were
burglary
second-degree
under
missouri
law,
which
we
contend
were
not
within
the
definition
of
violent
felony
under
this
statute.
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
that
holding
and
affirmed
a
15-year
sentence,
holding
that
anything
labeled
burglary
under
any
state
law
fell
within
the
definition
of
violent
felony.
the
sole
issue,
as
far
as
we
can
ascertain,
is
whether
the
definition
should
give
effect
to
the
statutory
language
and
limited
definition
to
burglaries
which
present
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
or
whether
a
definition
which
was
repealed
from
the
predecessor
statute,
the
1984
act,
should
be
given
effect
as
the
government
argues.
as
applied
to
petitioner,
if
those
second-degree
burglaries
are
found
to
present
a
risk
of
injury,
then
he
would
have
been
properly
sentenced.
otherwise,
he
should
be
given
a
new
sentence,
reversed
and
remanded
so
that
he
would
be
given
a
maximum
term
of
five
years.
in
the
abstract,
the
term
"burglary"
in
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
there
are
a
large
number
of
definitions
for
that
term
starting,
first,
i
think,
with
the
common
law
definition
which
is
the
breaking
and
entering
of
a
dwelling
place
in
the
night
time.
there
are
numerous
other
definitions,
though.
only
about
five...
as
many
as...
forms
of
common
law
burglary,
maybe
six
or
seven
states
have
that
definition.
and
there
are
many,
many
varying
definitions
of
burglary
among
the
other
states.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
i
believe
that's
correct.
insofar
as
there
may
be
a
vagueness
problem
with
the
term
burglary,
it
is
possible,
i
believe,
to
find
some
crimes
which
could
be
labeled
something
other
than
burglary,
or
maybe
be
burglary
and,
if
you
ruled
out
the
definition
entirely,
you
could
still
get
it
under
a
catch-all
definition
as
conduct
that
presents
a
risk
of
physical
injury
to
others.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
no.
i...
i
think
this
statute
can
be
construed
without
any
constitutional
problems.
i
didn't
raise
the
issue
below.
it
does
strike
me,
though,
as
burglary
without
being
defined
when
it
has
a
number
of
definitions
so
that
it
is
difficult
to
ascertain
an
ordinary--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--well,
not...
it
depends
whether
any
fool
was
in
maryland,
virginia
or
missouri.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
no.
i...
i
don't
believe
there
is.
at
least
not...
insofar
as
the
government
seeks
to
have
you
take
their
definition
as
one
which
would
be
any
concept
of
burglary,
because
that
definition
really
is
a
distillation
or
conglomeration
of
the
broadest
thing.
if
you
take
statutes--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--that's
right.
i
don't
propose
that
this
case
turn
on
vagueness.
the...
the
question
is
what
definition
of
burglary
is
appropriate
in
the
statute
and
there's
a
long
history
of
case
law
in
this
court
which
would
allow
you,
when
you
are
not
presented
with
a
clear
definition
of
what
burglary...
should
be
taken
as
the
proper
definition
that
congress
intended,
you
can
take
the
common
law
definition.
however,
i
think
there
are
other
definitions.
the
government-suggested
definition,
which
includes
really
all
state
burglaries,
it
is
drafted
so
broadly
that
it
appears
to
me
somebody
in
legislative
staff
or
the
justice
department
back
in
1984
said,
how
can
we
come
up
with
a
definition
that
includes
them
all
even
though
they
are
very
different
from
state
to
state.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
there
certainly
is
and
that's
the--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--that's
right.
so--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--because
there
is
no
requirement
under
that
statute
that
the
breaking
and
entering
had
occurred
in
dwelling
house
or
at
night.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
it
depends
on
whether
you
are
looking
at
my...
petitioner's
convictions,
which
under
a
repealed
federal
statute,
or
the
present-day
statute.
they
have
changed
the
definition
since
the
time
petitioner
was
convicted
in
1963
and
1971.
the
statute
he
was
convicted
under
was
a
breaking
and
entering
statute.
the
statute
in
present
day
is
framed
as
entering
or
remaining
unlawfully.
so
it
would
appear
to
include
shoplifting,
which
would
be
entry
in
a
building
with
intent
to
commit
a
crime.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
that's
correct.
among
the--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--surreptitiously.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
i
would--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--i
don't
believe
that
the
unlawful
part
needs
to
be
tied
to
entry.
and
in
that
respect,
i
think--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--essentially
that's
right
and
that's
the
way
california,
in
fact,
has
it.
shoplifting
is
burglary
in
california.
breaking
into
a
vending
machine
in
a
building
in
which
you
were
allowed
to
be,
or
even
not
within
a
building
in
some
states,
is
burglary.
you
may
recall
the
movie
cool
hand
luke.
he
broke
into
parking
meters,
and
that
would
be
burglary
in
texas.
the
states
have
a
wide
variety
of--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--excuse
me.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
no.
texas
has
a
burglary
statute...
coin-operated
machines--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--i
think
that's
right.
or
what
about
the
vending
machines
at
roadside
rest
or
in
a
gas
station?
there
are
places
where
you
don't
need
to
be
within
a
building,
which
i
think
further
highlights
the
problem
of
the
government's
definition.
in...
i'm
not
sure
whether
it's
north
or
south
dakota,
but
i've
cited
in
my
brief,
breaking...
or
not
breaking,
just
taking,
say,
a
carpenter's
tools
out
of
the
open
back
end
of
a
pick-up
truck
would
be
burglary.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
that's
right,
which
would
again...
i
don't
know
why
it
hasn't
been
raised
by
other
people
before,
but
it
seems
to
me
that,
again,
highlights
the
problem
of
a
potential
fact
case-bound
inquiry
that
that
test
requires,
because
many
of
these
statutes
do
not
require
a
building.
auto
burglary
is
a
problem.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
in
many
places
that's
counted
as
burglary.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
well,
that's
right,
but
that...
that's
just
another
example.
the
government
tries
to
say
that
their
test
is
an
easy
test
for
this
apply...
court
to
apply.
not
only
did
congress
just
make
a
mistake
and
we
should
supply
the
definition
for
them
today,
but
they
are
also
saying
this
is
an
easy
test
that
this
court
should
take
as
a
matter
of
policy,
when,
in
fact,
there
are
many
burglary
statutes
which
will
not
be
easily
applied
because
they
include
conduct
that
may
include
a
building
or
may
not.
and
you
still
will
have
to
investigate
the
underlying
offense.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
well,
if
you--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--that's
right.
if
you...
if
you
held
that
a
building
was
required,
which
hasn't
been
in
my
definition,
but
if...
if
it
was...
it
could
be
a
structure,
so--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--you
would
look
to
the
element
of
the
state,
and
i
think
that
that
is
the
best
way
to
take
it.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
that's
my
test.
so
i
would
have
no
problems
with
that.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
well,
it
is
if
you
limit
yourself
to
buildings.
all
i
was
saying
is
the
government...
the
way
i
read
the
government's
test,
which
seems
to
vary
in
their
brief,
but
in
at
least
one
place
the
government's
test
says
building...
i
believe
that's
in
the
repealed
1984
definition.
and
because
that
test
includes
the
word
building,
there
are
any
number
of
state
burglary
statutes
all
across
this
great
land
which
do
not
require
entry
into
building
in
order
to
fall
into
that
statute
and
be
a
conviction.
so,
okay.
if
you...
if
you
are
taking
my
test
and
not
the
government's
test
and
just
adding
in
the
word
burglary
into
my
test,
which
i
didn't
put
into
the
brief,
then
that's
fine
and
i
would
agree
and
they
would
be
entitled
to
not
consider
my
convictions
as
burglary.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
my
test
would
be
that
you
take
the
government's
proposed
test
from
the
'84
definition--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--entering--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--taking
crimes
that
are
punishable
by
a
term
exceeding
one
year.
any
crime
that
consists
of
entering
or
remaining
unlawfully
in
a
building
with
intent
to
commit
a
crime
that
is
a
federal
or
state
offense
and
which
has
as
an
element
necessary
for
conviction,
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
of
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another.
in...
by
way
of
example,
the
present-day
first-degree
burglary
statute
in
the
higher
aggravated
forms
of
burglary
in
almost
every
state...
not
all
of
them,
i
don't
want
to
mislead
you...
but
many
states,
most
of
them
have
higher
degrees
of
burglary.
and
those
are
targeted
at
the
so-called
violent
or
aggravated
crimes.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
yes,
it
does.
i
believe--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--well,
this
court,
first
of
all,
does
not
always
rely
on
something
like
"or".
for
example,
the
mail
fraud
case
not
too
long
ago...
i
think
it
was
mcnally...
you
had
an
"or"
and
you
related...
the
requirement
that
there
be
property
or
money
taken
in
the
mail
fraud
cases
you
related
to
artifice
or
scheme
to
defraud.
so
that
alone
i
do
not
think
is
dispositive.
more
important,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
says
"otherwise".
"otherwise"
clearly
makes
an
inference
that
although
congress
didn't
define
what
burglary,
we
sure
do
know
that
whatever
burglary
they
were
talking
about,
it
had
a
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
others.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
that's
right.
and...
and
the
legislative
history,
i
think,
thoroughly
supports
it.
i
know
not
everybody
thinks
the
legislative
history
is
important,
but
the
comments
we
have
from
the
people
in
the
house,
who
were
voting
on
this
and
fighting
not
to
include
any
property
crimes
at
all
because
we
just
want
to
get
bad
people
and
are
burglaries
really
that
bad...
that
was
the
gist
of
the
debate
in
the
house.
and
they
finally
got
convinced
by
the
people
in
the
justice
department
and
the
senate
that,
well,
perhaps,
some
of
these
burglaries
should
stay
and
be
enhancing
offenses,
and
so
let's
get
the
violent
ones.
i
think
that's
really
what
happened
in
this
case,
although
the
final
enacted
version
of
the
statute
is
not
clear
because
there
was
no
committee
report.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
that's
right.
roman
numeral
ii
has
the
word
conduct,
which
could
be--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--that's
right
and
if...
i
think
it
is
within
this
court's
prerogative,
certainly,
to
construe
it
that
way
and
examine
the
underlying
conduct
in
a
case-by-case
basis.
as
a
matter
of
policy,
i'm
not
sure
that's
what
you
want
to
do
and
force
the
district
courts
to
be
burdened
that
way.
and
i
think
you
have
a
body
of
case
law
which
supports
interpreting
it
otherwise.
normally,
federal
criminal
statutes
are
construed
in
a
uniform
way.
the
intent
of
congress
is
presumed
to
be
that
they
will
be
applied
from
some
definition.
and
although
they
may
make
a
reference
to
state
law,
that
the
state
definitions
themselves
should
not
control
it,
that
it
will
be
a
federal
definition
applied
to
the
state
crimes.
just
as
convictions
in
this
statute
have
been
previously
interpreted
i
think
in
the
dickerson
case.
they--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--no.
my
proposed
test
is
that
it
is
the
elements
of
the
crime
itself.
as...
i'm
just
willing
to...
to
understand,
yes,
it
does
say
conduct
and
it's
not
positively
clear
that
they
were
saying,
well,
there
could
a
categorical
approach.
it
could
be
conduct
in
an
element
or
it
may
not
be
and
so--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--i
think
you
could.
but
i
think
after
you
consider
the
statutes
that
are
out
their
and
realize
that
you
will
be
including
crimes
like
shoplifting,
which,
believe
it
or
not,
really
is
a
burglary...
felony
burglary
offense
out
in
california,
that
those
kinds
of
crimes
simply
are
not
violent
conduct.
and
i
think
if
you
frame
a
test
that
way,
you
are
not
doing
justice
to
the
words
that
congress
chose
when
they
said
violent
felony.
we're
talking
about
felonies
where
there
is
somebody
there
and
they
could
get
hurt.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
well,
i...
i
think
because
a
common
law
definition
of
burglary
could
still
involve
places
where
there
is
nobody
home
and
there
is
no
risk
of
injury.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
well,
i
think
that
the
risk
of
a
response
or
someone
returning
alone
is
not
enough
to
find
the
serious
potential
risk
of
injury
to
another.
if...
if
you
decide
that
a...
somebody
could
return
is
enough,
then
you
really
by
implication,
i
think,
have
to
extend
that
to
almost
every
crime
that
there
is.
somebody
could
investigate.
the
police
could
always
stumble
upon
a
numbers
runner
or
a
prostitution
ring
or,
you
know,
somebody
else
could
come
upon
the
crime
while
it's
happening.
whether
or
not
it's
a
burglary
or
anything
else,
i
think
just
the
mere
risk
of
investigation--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--well,
attempted
robbery
with
a
phoney
gun
falls
under
the
first
definition.
any
crime
against
the
person
is
already
covered
under
the
statute.
subdivision
1,
which
is
printed
in
the
briefs,
says
"any
crime
that
has
as
an
element
the
threatened
or
actual
use
of
force
against
the
person
of
another.
"
so,
we've
already
got
all
of
those
crimes
in
subdivision
1.
and
that
extends
from
all
the
robberies
to
murder,
rape,
kidnapping,
any
number
of
other
things.
the
only
question,
really,
with
respect
to
subdivision
2
is
what
property
crimes--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--that...
that's
one
of
them.
i
set
forth
a
number,
and
i
believe
really
that
number
three
is
duplicated
because
it
says
threatening
somebody
and
that
means
somebody's
there
also.
so
there
is
somebody
occupied.
i
also
include
the
presence
of
a
weapon,
which,
you
know,
you
may
be
able
to
say,
well,
how
can
a
weapon
be
dangerous
if
there's
nobody
there
to
be
shot?
but
i
think
that
states
an
awful
lot
about
the
burglar's
state
of
mind.
this
isn't
just
somebody
who's
sneaking
around,
casing
joints
where
he
can
get
in
and
out
when
nobody
is
there.
this
is
somebody
who's
going
in
and
he
is
ready
willing
and
able
to
kill
them,
harm
them
or
maim
them,
or
do
whatever
is
necessary
if
somebody
returns.
and
that's
when
i
think
you
take
that
minimal
risk
which
is
always
there
of
somebody
investigating.
that
gets
heightened
to
a
serious
risk
if
they
have
a
gun
or
a
dangerous
weapon.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
that's
right.
and
as--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--uh-huh.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
well,
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a...
a
fair
way
to
go
when
you
consider
the
language
at
the
end
of
the
statute.
and
it's
just--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--i
would
just
have
to
respectively
disagree
with
respect
to
that
because
of
the
"otherwise"
clause
and
the
fact
that
it
really
states
serious
potential
physical
risk
of
injury
to
others.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
well,
i
suppose
i
will
have
to
agree
that
that's
a
possibility,
as
is
justice
o'connor's
interpretation.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
is
that
the
language
is
not
clear.
what
we
have
here
is
an
ambiguous
criminal
statute
and
the
rule
of
lenity
which
this
court
has
consistently
upheld
as
recently
as
yesterday,
mandates
that
this
court
construe
the
statute
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
as
a
fall-back
position,
we
have
indicated
in
our
briefs--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--that
that
would
be
an
acceptable
alternative,
although
i
think--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--we
are
interested
in
winning
the
case,
justice
white.
[laughter]
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
i
believe
so,
although
it
depends
whether
or
not
you
then
look
to
the
statutes
themselves
to
determine
it
or
whether
you
look
at
the
underlying
conduct.
i
can't--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--really...
pardon?
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
well,
that's
a
big
problem
in
this
case
because
we
really
don't
know.
in
1971
i
was
able
to...
i
was
able
to
locate
the
police
report
from
1971.
but
that...
and
that
was
a
commercial
structure,
a
gas
station,
at
3:00
in
the
morning
that
was
unoccupied
and
the
defendant
was
unarmed.
he
got
caught...
or
his
friends
got
caught
crawling
out
of
a
window
with
a
case
of
oil.
[laughter]
but
the
1963
conviction,
we
don't
know.
the
government
was...
didn't
produce
any
evidence
of
the
police
reports
or
the
case
files.
i
called
and
was
unable
to
locate
it
and
the
probation
office
report
indicates
the
same,
that
they
were
unable
to
locate
those
files.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
it's
second-degree
burglary
and
we
also
know
that
there
was
$15.25
in
restitution
ordered
to
be
made
to
wilkin's
food
shop,
wherever
that
may
be.
but...
so,
i
would
assume
with
wilkin's
food
shop
being
involved,
that
that
particular
count
wouldn't
be
common
law
burglary.
but
there
were
two
other
counts...
because
that
was
a
three-count
conviction...
and
we
really
don't
know
what
was
involved
in
those
counts.
i
believe
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
just
like
to
point
out
a
couple
of
quick
items
in
my
remaining
minutes.
first,
i
note...
note
8
of
the
government's
brief,
they
indicate
several
places
where
there
are
the
use
of
the
common
law
burglary
or
other
statutes
different
than
their
interpretation
for
the
term
"burglary".
second,
i
think
this
is
a
plain
language
case.
more
than
anything,
although
the
legislative
history
supports
us,
in
a
response
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
the
comma
or
about
"or
otherwise"
modifying
"involves
use
of
explosives",
i
think
that
the
comma
after
"involves
use
of
explosives"
and
before
"or
otherwise"
precludes
that
interpretation
and
it's
just
as
likely
that
it
could
be
interrupted
to
modify
the
entire
portion
of
the
statute.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
i
say
you
look
at
the
statute.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
if
the
statute
didn't
require
them
to
be
in
every
case,
then,
under
my
interpretation,
it
would
not
be
an
enhancing
offense.
you've
still
got
the
guy.
he's
serving
his
time
now.
it's
just
a--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--question
of
whether
he
gets
the
extra
time.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
i
also
would
like
to
address
justice
white's
question
about
expanding
the
act.
i
think
it
is
important,
and
we
made
the
point
in
our
reply
brief,
and
i
think
the
legislative
history
definitely
supports
us
in
this
regard,
that
although
the
change
from
1984
to
1986
expanded
the
act...
which
it
undeniably
did;
it
added
all
of
the
various
crimes...
it
used
to
just
be
robbery
and
burglary
and
they
expanded
it
to
get
murder,
rape,
mayhem,
whatever
else.
but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
debate
about
excluding
property
crimes
and,
specifically,
burglary.
and
what
we
have
here
now
is
a
definition
where
i
believe--
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
--only
to
those
burglars
which
would
be
like
the
first-degree
burglary
statute
in
missouri
which
really
have
that
serious
potential
risk
of
injury.
i
also
think
that
it's
very
clear
that
the
government
definition
that's
proposed
is
not
an
ordinary
or
contemporary
definition.
it's
a
subset.
somehow
or
other
it
will
reach
the
various
burglary
crimes
across
this
country,
but
it
is
not
the
burglary
crime
themselves.
they
are
very
different.
and
it
clearly
omits
any
consideration
of
the
very,
very
narrow
burglary
crimes
which
we...
it's
our
position...
are
really
what
congress
was
intending
and
that's
the
aggravated
burglaries
and
the
violent
burglaries,
the
higher
degrees
of
burglary.
nothing
in
the
government's
definition
addresses
that
distinction
and
all
of
those
other
statutes
that
are
out
there
and
are
also
called
burglary.
mr.
bruce
d.
livingston
they
also
are
not
defined.
we
have
stated
in
our
brief
that
extortion,
particularly
is
problematic.
i
think
you
might
be
able
to
somehow,
when
you're
defining
what's
a
risk
of
injury,
maybe
arson
seems
to
be
a
kind
of
crime
that
has
a
risk
of
injury,
and
i
wouldn't
contest
it.
it
is
not
an
issue
here
to
day
anyway.
extortion,
justice
o'connor's
example,
is
a
very
good
one
of
the
kind
of
extortion
that
doesn't
present
a
risk
of
injury
and
i
think
it's
very
appropriate
that
that
not
be
an
enhancing
offense.
it's
not
the
same
as,
hey,
give
me
some
money
or
i'll
shoot
or
kill
your
child.
that's
the
kind
of
extortion
that
was
meant,
not,
hey,
i'm
going
to
tell
some
nasty
stories
about
you
if
you
don't
give
me
some
money.
that's
not
a
risk
of
injury,
and
i
would
think
there's
a
difference
between
those
two
kinds
of
extortion.
i
see
my
time
is
up.
