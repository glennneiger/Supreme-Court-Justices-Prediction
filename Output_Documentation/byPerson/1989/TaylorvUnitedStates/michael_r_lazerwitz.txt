mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
armed
career
criminal
amendments
act
of
1986
defines
the
term
"violent
felony",
which
may
trigger
a
mandatory
minimum
sentence,
to
include
any
felony
that
is
"burglary,
arson
or
extortion,
involves
the
use
of
explosives,
or
otherwise
involves
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
injury
to
another.
"
congress,
however,
did
not
further
define
the
term
burglary,
as
it
did
in
the
predecessor
1984
statute.
the
narrow
question
presented
here
is
whether
petitioner's
missouri
burglary
convictions
are
violent
felonies
under
the
1986
act.
but
in
order
to
resolve
that
question,
the
court
must
first
decide
what
congress
meant
by
the
term
2
of
section
924(e)(2)(b).
but
as
it
turns
out,
getting
to
the
bottom
of
the
first
inquiry,
effectively
resolves
the
second
issue
of
statutory
construction
and
ultimately
the
question
presented
in
this
case.
in
our
view,
the
pertinent
language
of
section
924(e),
1986
version
of
the
statute,
the
broad
contemporary
definition
that
was
explicitly
contained
in
the
1984
act.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
justice
o'connor,
and
although
that--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
it...
it
strikes
you
at
first--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
in
fact,
although
at
first
glance
it
seems
like
our
position
is
cockeyed,
it
turns
out
to
be
just
the
opposite,
because
even--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--i
will
explain.
and
petitioner
essentially
concedes
the
point
in
his
proposed
definition.
the
first
thing
we
have
to
do...
first
of
all,
we
could
make
believe
that
there
were
no
'84
definition.
we
have
a
statute
now.
congress
uses
the
term
burglary.
well,
what
does
that
term
mean?
this
court
has
long
held
that
when
a
term
has
an
ordinary
contemporary
meaning
and
congress
doesn't
otherwise
define
it
the
court
will
presume
that
congress
intends
that
meaning.
today,
and
in
1986,
the
term
burglary
does
have
a
core,
shared
meaning
in
this
country
and
that
is
the
unlawfully
entering
or
remaining
in
someone
else's
building
with
the
intent
to
commit
a
state
or
federal
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes.
and
just
to
clarify
one
point--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--that
is
the
core
definition
of
burglary
that
is
in
place
in
41
states
today
and,
agreed,
there
are
many
states
that
have
a
broader
definition.
but
this
is
what,
in
terms
of
the
common
denominator,
so
to
speak,
of
what
burglary
is
today.
there's
no
doubt
that
some
states,
many
states,
will
punish
as
burglary,
breaking
into
a
car,
breaking
into
a
vending
machine.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
there
are...
there
are...
as
we
counted
and...
there
are
five
states
that
have
retained
the
common
law
definition
of
burglary.
and
just
to
take
care
of
that
point
now,
one
of
the
reasons
why
this
court
shouldn't
adopt
the
common
law
definition
is
it
would
effectively
write
the
burglary
predicate
offense
out
of
the
statute.
and
we
certainly
know
that
congress
didn't
want
that
because
the
whole
point
of
the
act,
at
least
in
'84,
was
to
get
burglars
in
federal
prisons
if
they
commit
enough
crimes.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
because
there
are
five
states
that
have
burglary.
if
burglary
means
the
common
law
definition--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes.
and
we...
and--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
but...
and
under
subsection...
we're
not...
we're
not
here
to
quibble
with...
we
essentially
agree
with
petitioner,
that
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
man
was
convicted
of
and
that,
by
definition,
is
the...
the
statutory
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
and
that
is
the
problem
with
the
common
law
definition,
apart
from
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
presume
that
congress
intended
to
adopt
a
definition
that
has
been
discarded
for
so
many
years.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
and
the--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
and
that's...
and
again,
back
in
'84
the
generating
force
of
this
act
was
the
congressional
finding
that
career
offenders
are
responsible
for
a
grossly
disproportionate
number
of
crimes.
and
career
offenders
have
a
penchant
for
committing
burglaries
and
robberies.
and
burglaries
are
the
breaking
and
entering
of...
well,
the
entering
unlawfully
of
someone
else's
building
with
an
intent
to
commit
an
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
i'd
like
to--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--to
return
to...
to
return
to--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--i'd
like
to
clarify
one
point
that
wasn't
as
clear
in
our
brief
as
it
should
have
been.
the
word
"entering"
in
a
burglary
provision
is
a
term
of
art.
it
doesn't
mean
walking
into
a
public
building.
and
here's
an
example.
suppose
a
witness
intends
to
commit
perjury
on
the
witness
stand.
he
walks
into
the
federal
courthouse
intending
to
commit
an
offense.
he
may
become
a
perjurer
that
day,
but
he
is
not
a
burglar.
and
that
is
not
what
congress
had
in
mind,
and
that
is
not
what
most
states
have
in
mind.
california
does.
my
adversary
is
correct.
california
punishes
as
burglary
shoplifting.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
it
has
to
be
unauthorized
and
it
would
distinguish
between
the
shoplifter
and
the
person
who
lawfully
enters
into
a
store
and
stays
behind
after
hours
and
then
commits
the
offense.
and
that
was
the
point
of--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--they
both
entered
lawfully,
but
the...
our
position
is
that
if
you
lawfully
enter
a
building
and
commit
an
offense
inside,
you
have
not
committed
burglary,
except...
and
the
limited
exception
is
if
you
stay
after
hours,
which
then
makes
your
staying
unauthorized
and
then
you
commit
an
offense.
and
that
is--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
but
the
word
entering
in
the
context
of
a
burglary
provision--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--we
get--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--you
get
that--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--pardon?
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
it's
one
of
those
hypotheticals
that,
of
course,
will
never
come
up
and
if...
but--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
there's
no
doubt
that
those
are
potential
predicate
offenses,
but
not
in
the
government's
view
and
we
don't
prosecute
those
people
and
we
would
not
include
those
as
predicate
offenses.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no,
we...
we'd--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
we
know
it
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
repealed
missouri
statutes
that
are
attached
as
appendices
to
petitioner's
brief,
all
show
that
the
offense
was
breaking
and
entering.
now,
breaking
and
entering
in
a
burglary
statute
means
you're
not
supposed
to
be
there.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
and
today--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
it's
one
thing
to
say
you
don't
want
to
get
into
the
case-by-case,
but
it's
another
thing
to
say
you
don't...
just
want
to
look
at
the
statute
which
is
not
our
position.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
in
a
particular
case,
you
look
at
how
does
the
government
prove
or
attempt
to
prove
that
this
person
needs
the...
deserves
the
predicate...
excuse
me...
the
enhanced
sentence.
the
government
would...
typical
example
would
be
the
government
would
have
certified
copies
of
convictions.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
we'd
have
the
charging
documents
if...
if
we
could
find
them.
we'd
have
probation
reports.
would
put
on...
would
present
evidence.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
and
if
a
judge
were
concerned
that
this
person
were
convicted
of
burglary,
although
all
he
did
was
walk
into
a
store
and
steal
a
box
of
twinkies--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--if
the
statute
could
be...
if
the
statute--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--no
doubt
about
it.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
you
would
count
it.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
you
look
at
the
elements
of
the
offense
of
which
he
was
convicted.
there
are
many
burglary
statutes--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes.
you
would.
and
that
happens
every
day.
in
fact,
we
have
cases
that
are
on
appeal
that
involved
these
types
of
issues.
you
have
to--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--it's
elements
of
what
you...
it's
the
elements
of
the
offense
as
applied
to
what
he
was
convicted
of.
there's...
there
is
no
other
way
around
it,
given
the
way
that
the
burglary
statutes
today
are
written.
most
states
read
them...
there
is
no
doubt
that
many
states
criminalize
as
burglary
conduct
that
we
think
congress
intended
to
cover
and...
and--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
here
we
know
what
he
did.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
if
we
don't
know,
then
that's
going
to
be
a
problem
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--there
are
two
answers
to
that,
justice
o'connor.
we
do
know
what
happen
because
petitioner,
himself,
conceded
what
he
did.
and
you
find
it
in
the
joint
appendix
at
11
and
12,
which
is
a
filing
that
he
made
in
the
district
court.
he
told
us,
one,
that
we
know
from...
actually
we
know
from
the
police
reports
that
were
in
evidence
that
there
was
a
break-in
into
a
service
station.
the
second
offense,
the
'63
burglary
was
in
petitioner's
own
words
which
he
said
to
a
probation
officer,
"i
went
with
a
friend,
and
he
broke
into
his
girlfriend's
house
to
pick
up
his
clothes.
"
now,
that
might
sound
innocuous,
but
that's
a
burglary.
that's,
in
fact,
a
more
serious
burglary
than
the
service
station.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
as
you
know,
the
senate
has
passed
an
amended
version
last
year,
and
the
house
is
having
hearings
starting
next
month.
and
that's
as
far
as
we
know.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
it
would
be
to...
yes,
to
insert
the
definition
that
was
taken
out
back
into
the
statute
to
avoid
the
problems
that
this
court
is
seeing.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
that's
not
the
way
the
statute's
written.
that's
subsection
1.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
that's
subsection
1,
that's
not
subsection
2.
subsection
1
speaks
of
elements.
subsection
2
speaks
of
any
crime
that
involves...
that
is
burglary,
involves
use
of
explosives
or
otherwise
involves
conduct.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
that's--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
that...
that
effectively
reads
burglary
out
of
the
statute.
and
that
is
one
thing
that
we
don't
think
congress...
you
can
read
the
statute
that
way.
congress--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--no,
because
congress
specifically
inserted
the
word
burglary
into
the
statute
as
a
result
of
what
was
the
legislative
compromise.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
and
so
now
we
have
to
figure
out
what
burglary
means.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
it's
not
a
sensible
way
because,
first
of
all,
it's
not
what
congress
had
in
mind
and
it
effectively
would
take
out
of
the...
would
narrow
the
statute's
reach
in
such
a
way
that
would
make
it
ineffective
as
opposed...
with
respect
to
burglaries.
and
that's
not
the
way...
and
it's...
again,
there's
a
difference
between
subsection
1
and
subsection
2.
in
subsection
1,
congress
is
speaking
about
elements
necessary
for
a
conviction.
that's
not
the
language
in
subsection
2,
which
is
broader.
and
that's
our
position.
and
if
the
court
is
concerned
about
a
case-by-case
inquiry,
i
really
think
that's
not
such...
it's
not
such
an
onerous
burden.
this
is
what
happens
in
sentencings
all
the
time.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
that's
common
law
burglary.
if
it's
not--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
apparently
in
this
case,
the
guy
wasn't...
he
wasn't
authorized
to
be
in
the
house
and
maybe
they
weren't
his
clothes.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
that's
what
his
story
was
but
obviously
the
police
must
have
found
out
it
was
different
and
he
was
convicted
of
it.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes.
we
can't
go
behind
the
conviction
on
what
petitioner
had
said.
just
to
clarify
one
point,
or
to
stress
one
point,
the
court
should
not
be
swayed
by
this
sort
notion
that
district
courts
are
going
to
be
inundated
with
sentencing
hearings
and
making
difficult
choices.
this
is
what
goes
on
all
the
time.
this
is
a
burden
the
government
has
in
every
case
with
enhancement,
and
especially
under
the
guidelines
where
criminal
history
and
particular
conduct
is
so
important.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
there
are
a
couple
of
reason.
one,
it's...
it's
not
only
too
narrow
but
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.
and,
in
fact,
petitioner,
as
a
background
point,
raises
this.
but
no
one
is
seriously
arguing--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
under
his
elements
of
the
offense
test,
if
that
were
adopted,
it
would
accomplish
the
same
result,
in
our...
in
our
view,
because
if
you
look
at
most
state
burglary
statutes,
they
do
cover
things
other
than
buildings.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
but
we
are
no
longer...
that's
not
the
way
things
have
been
in
this
country
for
years.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
in
parron
and
bell
and
even
in
the
reagan
case
from
1895,
the
court
has
said,
listen,
when
common
law
no
longer
applies
or
obtains
in
society,
we
are
not
going
to
infer
that
congress
used
it.
and
that's...
it
couldn't
be
more
apparent
than
here
where
everyone
agrees
that
there
are
so
few
states
that
have
common
law.
now,
with
the
elements
of
the
offense
test,
we
certainly
reject
that
approach
because
it
would
accomplish
the
same
thing
and
read
the
statute
in
such
a
way
that
it's
not
written
and
also
ignore...
i
haven't
harped
on
the
legislative
record,
but
it
is
important
because
the
legislative
record
shows
that
congress
had
something
particular
in
mind.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
because
the
word
entering
means,
entering
without...
without
authorization,
without
privilege.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--the...
the
word
"entering"
is
a...
is
a
loaded
term.
but
to
make
it
more--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,
that...
when
we
say
entering...
when
congress
used
the
term
"entering",
congress
meant
entering
without
permission,
without
authorization.
there
is
no...
and
that...
that's
not
a
startling
proposition.
the
model
penal
code
has
a--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we
are
not
advocating
that
the
perjurer
is
a
burglar.
and
there--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--or
the
shoplifter.
and
we
would
not,
if
we
were
presented
with
the
california
predicate
offense
in
that...
of
that
type,
we
would
not
include
it.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
we
haven't
seen
anything
like
that.
in
a
similar
vein,
a
lot
of
states
criminalize
breaking
and
entering
into
a
car
as
burglary.
again,
that
wouldn't
satisfy
the
definition
that
congress
had
in
mind.
that's
not
the
type
of
offense
that
congress
wanted
as
a
predicate
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
we
didn't
cite
any
case
and
i
don't
know
of
a
particular
one,
but
i
don't
think
this
is
an
example
of
congress
repealing
the
definition.
and
i
say
that
because
congress...
there's
no
doubt
that
congress
changed
the
definitions
of
the
statute.
it
reworked
the
entire
statute
when
it
included
drug
offenses
and
what
is
now
violent
felony.
but,
at
the
same
time,
it
inserted
the
word
"burglary".
and
that
is
a
telling
point,
because
if
congress
where
repealing
entirely
its
treatment
of
burglary,
it
wouldn't
have
put
burglary
back
in.
and
it
wouldn't
have
done
so
because,
if
in
fact
petitioner
is
right...
the
words
"burglary,
arson,
extortion"
are
essentially
superfluous,
because
the
burglaries
that
he's
concerned
about
would
fall
within
the
catch-all
phrase.
but
congress
did
just
the
opposite.
they...
congress
put
in
the
word
"burglary,
arson
and
extortion"...
words...
and
for
the
court's
information,
three
predicate
offenses
that
were
first
voiced
to
the
house
in
the
hearings
from
the
justice
department.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
the
way
i
have
been
thinking
about
it
is
the
"or
otherwise"
modifies
the...
the
verbs
"is"
a
crime,
"is"
burglary,
"involves"
use
of
explosives,
or--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--no,
i
don't
think
so
because
i
don't
think
the
word
"otherwise"
can
bear
that
type
of
weight.
and
one
way
of
looking
at
is...
there
are
several
ways.
the
most
natural
reading
is
that
congress
has
decided
that
certain
generic
offenses...
burglary,
arson,
extortion...
do
present
the
type
of
conduct
that
presents
a
danger.
and
that
goes
back
to
what
the
court
was
discussing
before.
congress
can
be
seen
as
essentially
preempting
the
inquiry
that
was
raised
before.
how
do
we
know
whether
if
it's
a
building,
it's
potentially
violent?
how
do
we
know
whether
someone
is
inside?
does
that
make
it
potentially
violent?
if
the
court
wants
to
give
the
phrase
"or
otherwise"
an
aggressive
reading,
which
we
don't
urge
at
all,
but
even
if
the
court
wants
to,
i
think
the
most
that
you
can
get
out
of
is
congress
had
decided
that
burglaries,
as
we
define
them,
as
excluding
the
breaking
of
a
car,
the
breaking
of
a
coke
machine,
the
shoplifter,
that--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
i
don't
think
so
and
frankly,
the...
the
phrasing
"or
otherwise",
while
we
don't
even
think
that
it
should
be
given
an
aggressive
reading,
is
because
look
what
it
does.
it
actually
takes
away
a
negative
inference.
and
if
congress...
congress
put
back
in
the
statute
burglary,
arson,
extortion,
it
didn't
want
courts
to
decide
whether
a
particular
burglary
is
violent
or
not.
and
so
it...
it
included
certain
predicate
property
offenses,
but
said,
look,
we
also
want
to
include
other
types
of
offenses.
other
offenses...
for
example,
vandalizing
a
train
track,
that
would
be
conduct
that
otherwise
presents
a
potential
violence
to
person.
the
tylenol
poisoning
case,
that
type
of
conduct
would
fit
within
the
catch-all.
and
so
congress'
using
of
that
phrasing
doesn't
suggest
at
all
that
it
meant
to
modify
the
word
burglary,
which
would
be
an
awfully
cramped
reading
of...
of
that
phrase.
and
"otherwise",
in
any
event,
as
used
as
an
adverb
means
in
different
circumstances,
differently,
in
other
circumstances.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
one
example
would
be
in
section
2118(b)
of
title
18,
which
is
the
offense
of
burglarizing
a
place
of
business
that's
licensed
to
dispense
controlled
substances.
and
there
again,
congress
defined
the
offense
as
entering
unlawfully
this
place
of
business
with
the
intent
to
steal
controlled
substances.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no,
we--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--no,
we
counted
them
up
and
perhaps
it
would
have
been
wise
to
give
you
a
statutory
appendix,
but
we
looked
at
each
one
of
them--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--no.
there's
no
doubt.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
again,
congress'
using
the
term
"entering"
didn't
mean
the
shoplifter
and
there's
been
indication...
i
know
of
no
cases
where
we
prosecuted--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--very
few.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
very
few
require
mere
entering.
california
is
by...
is
certainly
in
the
minority
and
i'd
refer
you
the
discussion
of
the
model
penal
code
which
is
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
oh,
excuse
me.
that
would...
that
would
give
you
an
example
of
the...
the
few
states
that
do
criminalize
the--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes,--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--it's
essentially
the
same.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
every
one
of
them.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
your...
but
i
was
concerned
with
your
statement
about
its
got
to
be
a
building.
there
are
lots
of...
there...
not
every--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--right,
but
in...
but
in--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--a
building
plus
any
other
type...
lots
of
other
structures
are
covered.
and
under
the--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--oh,
yes,
there
are
lots
of...
i
don't
want
to
mislead
you,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--that
would
probably
be
in
the
minority.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
i...
again,
as
i
said
in
the
beginning,
it
is
the
common
denominator.
it
is
what
the...
what
you
will...
what
the
man
on
the
street...
what
a
mr.
taylor
would
think
is
burglary.
and
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
again--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--congress
took
this
definition
from
the
national
commission
of
the
reform
of
the
criminal
laws
in
the
early
1970s.
that's
were
this
definition
came
from.
and
that
is
what's
been
developed
as
the
consensus
of
burglary.
the
fact
that
other
states
criminalize
broader
conduct
doesn't...
you
can't
fault
congress
for...
for
adopting
a
more
narrow
definition.
and...
i
mean,
that's
our
position
we...
and
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
disagree
with
the
eighth
circuit
here.
it
just
doesn't
matter
what
the
state
calls
it,
it's
what
is
actually
going
on.
because
we
don't
think
a
guy
who
breaks
into
a
car
should
be
subject
to
an
enhanced
penalty
if
he
does
it
three
times.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
if
he
were
convicted
of
mayhem
and
the
elements
of
mayhem
didn't
include
the
use
of
explosives,
no,
i
don't
think
we
would...
that
would...
we
could
charge
him
with
that
predicate.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
we--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--no.
it's
got
to
be
what
he's
convicted
of,
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
we
don't
think,
for
example,
if
you're
charged
with
armed
robbery
and
you
plead
to
simple
larceny
that
we
can
walk
into
a
district
judge
and
say,
look,
although
he
is
convicted
of
simple
larceny
he
really
used
a
gun.
that's
not
fair
because
that's
not
what
he
stands
convicted
of.
and
that's
how
we...
that's
how
we've
been
applying
that...
the
statute.
if
there
are
no
further
question,
thank
you.
