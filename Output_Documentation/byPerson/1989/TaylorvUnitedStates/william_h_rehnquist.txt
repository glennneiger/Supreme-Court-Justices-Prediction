justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-7194,
arthur
lajuane
taylor
v.
united
states.
mr.
livingston.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i...
i
take
it
that
something
might
not
qualify
as
burglary
under
roman
numeral
ii,
but
might
qualify
as
presenting
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
another?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there...
there
is
a
common
law
definition
of
burglary,
isn't
it
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--of
breaking
and
entering
in
a
dwelling
place
at
night
with
intent
to
commit
a
felony?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
say
the
second-degree
burglary
in
missouri
would...
would
not
meet
that
definition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
or
that
it
be...
does
second-degree
burglary
in
missouri
require
the
entry
be
unlawful?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
at
the
time
he
was
convicted,
it
required
breaking
and
entering?
chief
justice
rehnquist
were
the
parking
meters
inside
a
building
in
texas?
chief
justice
rehnquist
setting
out
along
the
sidewalk
or--
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
you
tell
us
once
more
what
your
test
is?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but...
i
mean,
don't
incorporate
by
reference.
i
mean,
just
tell
us
from
the
beginning--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--what
your
test
is.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
let
me
interrupt
you
just
a...
just
a
minute,
mr.
livingston.
doesn't
your
definition
kind
of
meld
together
the
burglary
in
section
2
and
the
catch-all?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
is
the
justification
for
that?
they're
phrased
in
the
disjunctive.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
say
it's
in...
incorporated
in
the
definition
of
burglary
by
the
word
"otherwise"
is
the
requirement
that
there
by
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
others.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
are
not
really
melding
it
together
then
in
your
view.
you...
you
are
simply
construing
the
statute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
it...
is
it
your
position
that
one
looks
to
the
conduct
involved
in
the
particular
crime
for
which
the
defendant
was
convicted
or
in
the
statutory...
to
the
statutory
elements
of
the
crime?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
don't
you
urge
the
common
law
definition
of
burglary?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i...
i
think
that
the
common
law
theory
of
burglary
was
that
if
you
broke
into
a
dwelling
at
the...
nighttime,
the
people
could
come
home
while
you
were
there
even
if
they
weren't
there
when
you
came.
that
there
was
a
risk.
it
didn't
have
to
be
a
risk
which
materialized.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
about
an
attempted
robbery
with
a
phoney
gun?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
precisely--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--what
precisely,
again,
was
the
conduct
of
which
your
client
was
convicted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
all
you
know
is
that
it's
second-degree
burglary
under
missouri
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
livingston.
now,
mr.
lazerwitz.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well...
well
wait
a
minute
mr....
you...
you
say
it
does
have
commonly
accepted
meaning.
i
mean,
is
that
meaning
commonly
accepted
other
than
having
been
adopted
by
congress
in
1984?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
i
take
it
nine
would
not
punish
some
of
those
things
as
burglaries
but--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--why
would
it
write
the
burglary
part
of
the
thing
out?
chief
justice
rehnquist
can
you
just...
in
your
definition,
is
there
any
unlawful
aspect
required
for
the
entry?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
which
one
didn't
enter
lawfully?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's...
what's
the
provision
of
missouri
law?
how
does
it
read
that
makes
it
a
burglary
to
break
into
your
girlfriend's
house
to
get
your
clothes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah...
i
know,
entering...
entering
to
commit
a
felony--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--is
common
law.
picking
up
your
own
clothes
is
a
felony?
chief
justice
rehnquist
anyway,
he
was...
he
was--
--well,
i
thought...
i
thought
you...
i
thought
you
said
he
was
convicted
of
entering
his
girlfriend...
for
helping
entering
his
girlfriend's
house
to
pick
up
his
clothes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
say
the
common
law
definition
makes
no
sense?
it
certainly
made
sense
to
the
common
law
judges.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i
think
the
court
has
adopted
common
law
definitions
at
times
when
perhaps
common
law
had
been
superseded
in
places
by...
by
statute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
what's
your
position
on
the
use
of
the
ending
phrase
"or
otherwise
involves
conduct"?
you
say
that
just
modifies
explosives?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
that
suggests
that
burglary
must
somehow
involve
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
would
also
shed
some
light
on
what
congress
meant
by
burglary.
if
we
are
in
doubt
about
what
the
definition
of
burglary
is,
it
would
suggest
that
the
definition
of
burglary
would
have
to
involve
conduct
that
presents
a
serious
potential
risk
of
physical
injury
to
other...
to
another.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazerwitz.
mr.
livingston,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
livingston.
the
case
is
submitted.
