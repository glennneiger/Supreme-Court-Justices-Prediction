justice
white
there
would
to
be
some...
some
conduct
that
any
fool
would
know
is
burglary,
wouldn't
there?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
i
know.
but
isn't
there
some...
isn't
there
some
core
meaning
to
burglary
that
all...
every
state
would
recognize?
justice
white
well,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
suggesting
you
take...
take
right
now...
take
the
government's.
i'm
just
wondering
if...
i'm
just
going
into
the
possible
argument
about
vagueness,
which
you
have
given
up
anyway,
i
take
it.
justice
white
of
course,
that--
--i'm
sorry.
it
seems...
the
way
you
put
it
awhile
ago,
you
would
require
the
burglary
that
justifies
enhancement
with...
it
would
have
to
have
as
an
element
of
the
offense--
justice
white
--the
conduct.
which
is
different
than
what
is
stated
in...
in
roman
numeral
ii
here.
justice
white
and
it...
and
it
would
qualify,
if
it's
conduct,
that
it
might
endanger
others
even
if
it's
not
a
part
of
the
offense.
justice
white
that
doesn't
mean
you
construe
it
like
you
suggest.
the
common
law
definition
would
get
your
client
off
the
hook,
wouldn't
it?
justice
white
well,
that's--
justice
white
--well,
you
want
to
win
your
case
on
any
ground,
i
suppose.
like
the
common
law--
justice
white
--so,
the
common
law
definition
would
win
it
for
you,
i
take
it?
justice
white
that...
that
was
the
'84
definition?
justice
white
well,
if
you
adopt
a
common
law
definition,
you're
really
narrowing
the
kind
of
burglary
that
it
was
reached
by
this
act.
justice
white
and
i...
and
the...
and
this...
this
new
act
was
intended
to
expand
the
coverage
of
the
act.
justice
white
at
least
he
was
convicted
of
burglary
under
the
state
law.
justice
white
you
say
41
states
have
rejected
it?
justice
white
is
there
any
other
statute
besides
the
'84
statute
that
defines
burglary...
i
mean
federal
statute?
justice
white
where
do
you
get
the...
where
do
you
get
the...
to
what
do
you
refer
in
saying
there
are
41
states
that
have
a
core
meaning
to
burglary?
is
that
in
the
model
penal
code--
justice
white
--somewhere
or
you
counted
them
up?
justice
white
but
each
one
of
them
isn't...
isn't
the
'84
definition.
justice
white
because...
because...
what...
the
'84
definition
just
covered
mere
entering.
justice
white
well,
do
the
41
states
you
talk
about
cover
mere
entering
or
does
it
require--
justice
white
--unlawful
entering?
justice
white
xxx.
justice
white
is
the
model
penal
code
definition
what
you're--
justice
white
--looking
for?
justice
white
your
claim
is
that
it
narrowed
the
reach
of
the
burglary
predicate
offense.
