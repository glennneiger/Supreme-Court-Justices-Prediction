justice
kennedy
you
haven't
challenged
the
statute
as
being
vague,
have
you?
justice
kennedy
but
that
seems
to
me
to
call
into
question
your
definition
of
burglary,
and
it's...
it's
just
not
clear
to
me
what
cases
would
fall
under
your
definition.
would
the
statute
have
to
have
an
element
that
the
person
be
present
in
the
burglarized
premises?
is
that
the
logical
import
of
your--
justice
kennedy
have
you
cited
us
any
cases
in
which
a
definition
is
used
in
a
statute
after
the
congress
has
repealed
it,
or
would
this
be
a
novel
application?
