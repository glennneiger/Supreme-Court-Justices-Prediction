justice
o'connor
--well,
mr.
livingston,
in
your
view
i
guess
these
other
provisions
in
the
statute
for
arson
and
extortion
would
likewise
have
to
have
built
into
them
some
other
element
that
one
wouldn't
usually
find.
i
mean,
you
can
have
arson
if
somebody
goes
out
and
sets
a
haystack
on
fire
where
there's
no
one
around.
or
you
could
have
extortion
based
on
the
threat
of
disclosure
of
information,
not
some
physical--
justice
o'connor
--violence.
and
so
it's
more
than
just
burglary
here.
justice
o'connor
i
assume
that
because
congress
included
those
three
words
that
they
should
have
at
least
their
common
ordinary
meaning
so
far
as
we
can
determine
them,
and
they
wouldn't
necessarily
include,
i
think,
the
elements
as
you've
described
them.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
think
it's
a
pretty
logical
explanation.
congress
had
different
proposals
in
front
of
it.
some
people
thought
it
ought
to
be
limited
only
to
crimes
where
there
was
risk
of
physical
injury,
and
other
members
of
congress
thought
that
burglary
should
be
included
in
the
list,
arson
and
extortion.
and
they
amalgamated
the
two
in...
in
the
way
that
we
see
here,
which
i
think
can
logically
be
read
to
include
burglary,
arson
and
extortion
regardless
of
the
risk
of
physical
injury.
justice
o'connor
well,
you'd
have
us
read
into
this
as
the
definition
the
definition
that
was
actually
contained
in
the
earlier
act,
i
gather.
justice
o'connor
that's
a
little
hard
to
do,
faced
with
the
fact
that
they
didn't
reenact
it.
justice
o'connor
well,
you've
left
out
the
definition
of
breaking
and...
i
mean,
in
the
definition
of
breaking
and--
justice
o'connor
--entering.
i
mean,
in
the
definition
of
breaking
and
entering.
justice
o'connor
you
just
say
entering
or
remaining
surreptitiously.
justice
o'connor
--except
that
there
was
an
order
for
restitution
to
a
store
for
$15.
justice
o'connor
mr.
lazerwitz,
what
is
the
current
status
of
any
efforts
to
get
congress
to
amend
or
enact
a
definition
of
burglary?
justice
o'connor
and
the
proposal
would
do
what?
reenact
the
old
definition?
