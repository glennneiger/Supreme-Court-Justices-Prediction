justice
stevens
--but
i
thought
the
government's
definition
picked
up
on
the
definition
that
was
left
out
in
those
two
or
three-year
periods,
and
that
requires
a
building,
doesn't
it?
justice
stevens
well,
but
then--
justice
stevens
--then
they
wouldn't
be
covered.
i
don't
understand
the
problem.
justice
stevens
it
assumes
that.
justice
stevens
that
is
not
the
literal
reading
of
the
definition
you
propose,
though,
because
the
definition
you
propose
is
entering
with
intent
to
commit
a...
a
felony.
justice
stevens
well,
how
do
we
know
this?
i
mean,
certainly
you
don't
get
that
out
of
the
language.
your
perjury
example,
i
think
is
an
excellent
hypothetical.
justice
stevens
it
falls
squarely
within
the
text
of
your
proposed
definition.
justice
stevens
--well,
no,
but
the
shoplifting
example
comes
up.
justice
stevens
say
somebody
goes
into
the
department
store
lawfully
but
with
an
intent
to
steal
something.
justice
stevens
i
know
you
don't
prosecute
them,
but...
maybe
that's
what
happened
to
this
particular...
defendants
in
missouri.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
maybe...
i
don't...
i
don't
know
the
missouri
definition.
but
if
the
missouri
definition
is...
is
in
exactly
the
same
words
as
yours,
how
do
we
know
it
didn't
include
the
perjury--
justice
stevens
--or
the
shoplifting?
justice
stevens
well,
but--
justice
stevens
--that
may
be.
but
supposing
the
state...
you...
one
of
your
arguments
is
that
about
40
or
41
states
have
very
similar
statutes.
and
say
all
we
know
about
the
other
state
statute
involved...
it
may
not
be
true
in
this
case...
is
that
it
has
the
same
text
as
your
definition,
and
he
was
convicted
of
it.
how
do
we
know
that
that
court
didn't
decide
all
he
did
was
walk
in
intending
to
commit
perjury
or
shoplifting?
how
do
we
tell
without
getting
into
the
case-by-case
business
that
everybody
seems
to
agree
we
don't
want?
justice
stevens
well,
the
statute
as
construed
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
but
it's
never
had
this
particular
question.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
just
make...
be
sure...
i--
justice
stevens
--well,
let
me
go
back
if
i
may
because
i
thought
earlier
we'd
all
agreed
that
it's
an
elements
of
the
offense
test.
and
supposing
you
have
in
the
other
state
a
definition
of
burglary
that
clearly
includes
robbing
a
parking
meter
out
in
the...
in
some
public
area.
that's
burglary
in
texas,
but
it
also
covers
a
lot
of
other
stuff.
and
in
the
particular
case
you've
got
a
defendant...
if
you
look
at
the
record,
you
find
that
he
really
broke
and
entered
a
home
in
a
classic
common
law
burglary.
do
you
use
that
or
not
to
enhance?
justice
stevens
the
statute
is
broad
enough
to
cover
parking
meters,
the
facts
of
the
case
where
a
home.
justice
stevens
no
doubt
about
it?
what's
the
answer?
which
way?
justice
stevens
oh,
you
do
count
it?
justice
stevens
so
you
don't
look
at
elements
of
the
offense,
you
look
at
the
actual
facts.
justice
stevens
and
if
your
record
shows
nothing
but
conviction,
murder
two
pursuant
to
statute
certain
number
so
and
so,
that's
not
enough
to
answer
the
question.
you've
got
to
go
behind
that?
justice
stevens
so
it's
not
an
element
of
the
offense
test,
it's
a
particular
fact
in
the
charging
papers?
justice
stevens
supposing
the
charging
papers
in
this
case
say
burglary
of
department
store,
hecht's,
at
such
and
such
an
address,
period?
justice
stevens
yeah,
but
lots
of
times
you
don't.
i
mean,--
justice
stevens
--i
see.
okay.
well,
i
thought
petitioner's
counsel
said
we
don't
know
what
was
done
on
one
of
the
prior
convictions--
justice
stevens
but
then...
part
of
your
argument
against
using
the
common
law
burglary
definition,
i
thought,
was
you
wanted
to
avoid
all
these
inquiries.
but
that's
not...
your
reason
on
the
common
law...
objecting
the
common
law
burglary
is
that
it's
just
too
narrow
and
congress
want
something
broader.
that's
basically--
justice
stevens
--but
his
reason
for
not
agreeing
with
it
is
he
wants
to
avoid...
he
wants
to
rely
on
elements
of
the
offense
and
he
agrees
that
that
wouldn't
fit
in
the
common
law
burglary
because
most
states
copy,
except
five.
justice
stevens
can
you
explain
to
me
again
why
the
language
of
your
proposed
definition
does
not
cover
entering
the
courthouse
with
the
intent
to
commit
perjury?
justice
stevens
and...
unlawfully
entering...
you
are
in
effect...
you
are
adding...
you
have
not
given
us
an
accurate
definition
of
what
your
real
position
is
then.
the
word
entering
could
be
unlawfully
entering--
justice
stevens
--unconsented
entering.
justice
stevens
but
that's
what
you're
saying,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
it's
not
startling
except
it
isn't
the
position
i
understood
your
brief
to
advocate.
that's
why
i'm
startled.
justice
stevens
or
the
shoplifter
then?
justice
stevens
yeah.
may
i
ask
you
again,
if
we...
if
we
modify
the
definition
on
page
28
of
your
brief
by
adding
41
states
would
fit
that
definition?
justice
stevens
every
one
of
them
would?
so...
and
if
that's
an
element
then
i...
then
the
only
states
in
which
you
would
lose
under
my
suggestion...
you
just
look
at
the
element
of
offense...
are
in
the
other
nine
states.
justice
stevens
well,
your
definition
has
got
to
be
a
building.
justice
stevens
well,
isn't
that
true
of
all
41
states?
justice
stevens
oh,
so
those
definitions
are
broader
than
this--
justice
stevens
--how
many...
how
many...
do
you
know
off
the
top
of
your
head
how
many
states
have
a
crime
of
burglary
that
is
defined
in
this
way
and
no
more
broadly?
justice
stevens
oh.
so
this
is
not...
this
is
not
at
all
typical
then?
justice
stevens
well,
how
do
we
know
that?
well,
but
you
could
also
say
they
all
cover
going
in
with
an
armed
gun
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
there
are
people
there.
then
you
say
all
50
states
have
adopted
that
definition--
justice
stevens
--because
they
all
include
it.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
that's
very
important
to
me?
that...
in
your
view
of
elements
supposing
your
client
had
been
charged
with
a
crime,
whatever
the
definition
we
end
up
with,
that
fit
the
definition
but
the
statute
in
the
state
involved
permitted
conviction
for
a
broader
category.
do
you
say
you
look
at
the
charging
papers
or
you
look
at
the
statute?
justice
stevens
so
you
would
say
in
all
those
cases
that
it
doesn't
count,
even
though
they
can
prove
without
any
question
that
the
elements
of
the
offense
were
present
in
the
particular
case,
if
the
statute
didn't
require
them
to
be
in
every
case?
justice
stevens
no,
i
understand.
justice
stevens
but
you...
you
and
the
government
do
differ
on
this
point
in--
justice
stevens
--i
just
want
to
be
sure.
