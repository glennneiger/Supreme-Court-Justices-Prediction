mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
are
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
this
suit
was
filed
in
1983
to
stop
medtronic
from
infringement
of
two
basic
patents
related
to
a
medical
device
known
as
an
automatic
implantable
defibrillator.
medtronic
defended
in
part
in
the
court
below
arguing
that
its
infringing
activities
were
exempt
from
the
patent
infringement
laws
based
on
a
1984
statute.
the
question
before
this
court
is
the
interpretation
of
that
statute,
which
is
35
u.s.c.
section
271(e)(1).
that
statute
provides
that
it
shall
not
be
an
act
of
infringement
to
manufacture,
use
or
sell
a
patented
invention
solely
for
uses
reasonably
related
to
the
development
and
submission
of
information
under
a
federal
law
regulating
drugs.
i
submit
that
there
is
only
one
proper
interpretation
of
that
statute.
it
applies
to
drugs
only,
and
has
no
application
whatever
to
other
nondrug
products
regulated
under
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act,
namely,
medical
devices,
color
additives
and
food
additives.
the
statute
refers
on
its
face
only
to
drugs.
the
statutory
definition
of
drugs
in
the
fda
act
excludes
specifically
devices.
a
century
of
fda
legislation
has
treated
drugs
differently
from
devices
from
1906
until
the
present.
now,
medtronic
argues
that
the
phrase
"federal
law
regulating
drugs"...
and
it
takes
that
phrase
out
of
context...
medtronic,
the
respondent,
argues
that
the
phrase
"federal
law
regulating
drugs"
equals
and
means
the
entire
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
and
even
the
nondrug
products.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
no,
your
honor.
the
court,
i
suggest...
well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
analyze
what
the
phrase
federal
law
regulating
drugs
meant.
what
the
court
did
was
go
to
one
piece
of
the
legislative
history
dealing
with
their
analysis
of
what
the
roche
bolar
decision
had
done
and
look
at
that.
and,
in
fact,
the
court
decision
when
it
goes
to
the
words
of
the
statute
simply
leads
off
by
saying
we
conclude
that
this
statute
covers
any
patented
invention
so
long
as
it's
for
the
limited
purposes
enumerated.
but
it
never
discusses
how...
what
the
meaning
of
the
remaining
phrase
is
and
how
does
that
fit
into
the
statute.
and
i
suggest
one
of
the
errors
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
which
medtronic
has
failed
to
support
is
that
it
doesn't
deal
with
the
specific
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
no,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
that
the
critical
language
starts
with
after
"solely
for
use
as
reasonably
related
to.
"
and
then
we
focus,
"the
development
and
submission
of
information
under
a
federal
law
regulating
drugs.
"
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
oh,
absolutely.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
now,
if...
if
medtronic's
construction
is
accepted,
what
we
have
then
is
the
inclusion
in
the
exemption
by
a
matter
of
mere
happenstance,
a
product
is
now
included,
even
though
not
referred
to,
just
because
it
happens
to
have
been
regulated
under
the
federal
law,
the
fd&c
act
that
also
regulates
drugs.
indeed,
what
we
wind
up
with
is
the...
the
absurd
result,
i
suggest,
that
the
law
would
mean
the
same,
that
the
medical
devices
and
color
additives
would
be
equally
well
included
if
the
statute
read
"federal
law
regulating
color
additives"
or
"federal
law
regulating
cosmetics"
since
these
products,
too,
like
drugs,
are
all
regulated
under
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
your
honor,
it's
a
law
regulating
many
products.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
drugs
are
one,
devices
are
another.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
out
of
context
i
think
it
might
be
referred
to
as
that,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
within
the
context
of
the
statute,
especially
where
they
have
already
referred
to
the
entire
act--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--within
the
context
of
this
statute,
yes,
your
honor.
if
i
take
the...
if
i
take
the
lines
out
of
context
and
i
say
can
i
sit
there
and
look
at
that
phrase
out
of
context,
i
would
say
yes,
it
is
possible.
but
when
we
consider
that
we
have
the
fda
act
itself
defining
drugs
as
"excluding
devices"...
when
we
have
the
legislative
history
specifically
stating
that
the
only
activity
that
is
being
exempted
is
drug
testing
activity
and
when
we
have
the
fact
that
other
nondrug
products,
such
as
medical
devices,
color
additives
and
food
additives,
are
developed
and
submitted
under
different
laws,
different
provisions
of
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act,
then
are
drugs,
then
i
say
yes,
your
honor,
it
is
not...
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
within
the
context
of
this
statute
and
all
of
its
provisions
are
not--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--i
missed
the
question,
but--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--well,
i
think
that's
what
medtronic
is
saying,
which
happened
to
regulate
drugs
or
anything
else.
and
what
i
am
saying--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--yes.
and...
and
what
i...
what
i
am--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--what
i'm
saying
is
it...
it...
the
law
that
regulates...
regulates
for
development
and
submission...
for
example,
in
drugs,
is
section
355
of
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
for
devices
it
would
be
360(e)
and
(j)
and
different
provisions
for
the
different
nondrug
products.
and
when
they
said
federal
law
regulating
drugs,
they
literally
meant
drugs
and
they
did
not
mean
nondrug
products
such
as
devices.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
well,
they
didn't
mean
the
entire
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--since
they've
already
referred
to
that
just
three
lines
above
and
had
they
intended
to
use
that
phrase,
they
would
have.
now,
i
would
suggest
with
respect
to
the...
the
absurd
result
that
i
think
is
caused
by
medtronic's
interpretation...
that
is,
the
law
would
have
meant
the
same
thing
under
medtronic's
interpretation
if
it
said
federal
law
regulating
cosmetics
or
color
additives...
that
that
alone
suggests
it's
an
unreasonable
interpretation
that
medtronic
is
suggesting.
now,
i
believe
that
congress
would
not
have
been
so
haphazard
and
so
totally
inconsistent
with
the
term
drugs
as
it's
used
throughout
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
and
that
congress
was
not
so
inconsistent.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
yes.
because
submissions
are
made
under
different
sections
of
the
law
for
different
products
that
are
regulated
within
the
drug
and
device
field.
and
submission
for
drugs
is
made
under
355,
submission
for
devices
under
360(e)
and
(j),
and
so
on.
color
additives,
i
believe,
under
348,
and
food
additives
under
376.
so,
when
congress
was
talking
about
development
and
submission,
that's
what
they
were
talking
about.
they
didn't
intend
to
refer
to
the
entire
act.
had
they
done
so,
they
would
have
used
the
phrase,
"the
entire
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
"
as
they
did
a
few
lines
above
in
the
very
same
statute.
now,
the
legislative
history--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--it...
it
does
if
that...
it
can
also
refer
to
an
act,
your
honor,
if
the
act
does
nothing
but
regulate
drugs
and
if
all
of
its
provisions
are
drug
regulatory.
so,
it...
it...
it
may
refer
to
a
section
in
the
case...
the
section
is
a
drug-only
section,
or
it
may
refer
to
an
act
if
it's
a
drug-only
act,
but
it
refers
only
to
the
provisions
that
do
the
regulation
and
require
submission
of...
of
information
under
a
drug
law.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
yes,
and
that's
355.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
your
honor,
they
might
have
done
that
and...
and
that's...
that's
an
alternative
way
they
could
have
done
it.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
well,
i'm
not
limiting
it
to
355
because,
of
course,
we
have
biological
products...
i
mean,
human
biological
products
that
are
regulated
under
a
different
section...
in
fact,
a
different
act,
the
public
health
service
act.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
they
were.
veterinary
biologics
were
not,
but
human
biologics
were.
all
human
drug
products
were
included
in
the
1984
statute
as
enacted.
now,
legislative
history
is
intended
to
resolve
doubt,
but
not
to
create
it.
i'd
suggest
medtronic
has
attempted
to
do
just
the
opposite
here.
there
are
13
separate
references
in
the
committee
reports
regarding
section
271(e)(1).
each
and
every
one
of
them
is
drug
in
the
drug
context
and
drug
specific.
the
house
report,
in
fact,
specifically
states
that
the
only
activity
exempted
is
drug
testing
activity.
in
medtronic's
only
quote
from
the
legislative
history,
in
their
only
quote,
they
omit
the
very
phrases
in
the
legislative
history
that
specifically
say
the
purpose
is
to
exempt
drug
testing.
i
suggest
congress
meant
what
it
said.
section
271(e)(1)
is
a
narrow
exemption.
it's
a
drug-only
statute,
and
it
does
not
apply
to
infringing
medical
devices
such
as
medtronic's
product
in
suit.
the...
the
focus
on
the
language
which
i've
talked
about,
development
and
submission,
we've
talked
about
it
applying
to
different
sections
of
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
i
think
it
would
be
difficult
for
congress
to
have
selected
a
less
appropriate
word
than
drugs
if
it
intended
to
include
devices
in
light
of
the
fact
that
the
statute
already
defines
drugs
as
excluding
devices.
and
it's
unreasonable,
i
suggest,
that
congress
later
in
different
reference
to
federal
law
regulating
drugs
was
intended
to
include
the
entire
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
referred
to
just
a
few
lines
above.
in
addition,
other
statutes
also
confirm
and
support
that
271(e)(1)
is
a
drug-only
statute.
for
example,
(e)(1)
exempts
drugs.
section
(e)(2)
applies
certain
patent
owner
protections
with
respect
to
that
exemption.
in
1984
when
congress
placed
human
drugs
in
the
exemption
of
(e)(1),
they
also
placed
human
drugs
in
the
patent
order
protections
of
(e)(2).
in
1988
when
the
laws
were
amended,
congress
added
animal
drugs
and
veterinary
biological
products
to
the
exemption
of
(e)(1).
they
also
added
them
to
the
exemption
to
the
patent
owner
protection
of
(e)(2).
indeed,
the
proposed
senate
bill
which
sought
to
add
medical
devices
to
section
271(e)(1)
also
added
them
to
the
patent
owner
protections
of
(e)(2).
i
suggest
it's
indisputable,
even
by
medtronic,
medical
devices
are
not
in
section
(e)(2),
and
the
reason
is
simple:
because
congress
never
put
them
in
section
(e)(1).
in
addition,
the
relationship
of
the
patent
extension
law,
section
156,
and
the
words
of
that
statute
to
the
words
of
(e)(1)
are
also
relevant
and
also
confirm
that
(e)(1),
271(e)(1),
is
a
drug-only
statute.
the
words
of
156,
the
patent
extension,
use
the
specific
products:
drugs,
medical
devices,
food
additives
and
color
additives.
in
sharp
contrast,
271(e)(1)
refers
only
to
drugs.
and
this
disparate
inclusion
and
exclusion
of
these
two
statutes
enacted
at
the
same
time
in
1984
also
confirms
that
271(e)(1)
is
a
drug-only
statute.
and
it's
no
wonder
that
section
271(e)(1)
is
limited
to
drugs
whereas
section
156
is
a
multi-product
statute
for
extensions.
section
156,
the
patent
extension
law,
was
in
congress
or
similar
bills
were
before
congress
for
years
and
years
before
section
271(e)(1)
had
ever
been
thought
of.
in
1980-81
there
were
extension
bills
that
applied
the
extension
in
order
to
further
patent
rights
to
multiproduct
applications.
the
quid
pro
quo
for
156
as
it
was...
as
it
was
shepherded
through
the
house
was
not
(e)(1).
it
was
the
speedy
new
procedures
for
generic
drugs,
which
we
call
anda
or
abbreviated
new
drug
applications.
and
that
was
the
tradeoff
that
congress
entered
into,
and
that
tradeoff
had
been
effected
in
19...
late
'83
or
early
'84.
and
then
along
came
the
roche
bolar
decision
of
the
federal
circuit
which
said
specifically
that
generic...
that
the
use
of
a
generic
drug
for
a
bioequivalency
test
in
order
to
get
approval
was
a
patent
infringement.
and
it
was
then
that
the
generic
drug
companies
said
if
we're
to
get
the
benefit
of
these
speedy...
new
speedy
drug
laws
called
anda,
we
need
to
get
a
concomitant
exemption.
and
it
was
with
that
thought
in
mind
that
section
(e)(1)
came
into
effect
in
order
to
further
the
abbreviated
new
drug
applications,
again
confirming
it's
a
drug--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--veterinary
biological
products
were
added
in
1988.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
yes,
it
is.
and
veterinary
biological
products
as
well
as
animal
drugs
were
both
added
to
the
statute,
and
there
are,
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
there...
there
is
a...
the
application
now
applies
to
a
speedy
procedure
for
animal
drugs,
and
it
applies
to
veterinary
biological
products
across
the
board.
i
am
not
sure,
your
honor,
whether
there
is
any
speedy
procedure
for
veterinary
biological
products.
i
believe
that
there
is
none,
but
i'm
not
sure
of
that
fact.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
271(e)(1)
in
1984
specifically
excluded
animal
drugs
and
veterinary
biological
products
from
its
application
and
then
in
1988
both
of
those
things,
except
when
they
were
manufactured
through
a
genetic
engineering
process,
were
both
put
into
the
exemption
so
now
animal
drugs,
veterinary
biological
products
and
human
drugs,
all
drug
products,
i
suggest,
all
of
those
things
are
in
the
exemption
of
section
(e)(1),
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
i
can't
be
certain
whether
the
'88
amendments
were
for
the
same...
were
across
the
board
for
the
same
reasons
or
not
because,
as
i
say,
i
think
there
is
a
speedy
provision
for
animal
drugs
for--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--here
it
was
a
medical
device
called
an
automatic
implantable
defibrillator.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
they
were
using
it...
they
were
implanting
it
in
patients
on
a
long-term,
permanent
basis,
selling
it
for
from
$17,000
to
$20,000
per
unit
and
using
it
for
its
normal
intended
purpose
to--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--that's
correct,
justice
white,
and
we
would
suggest
that
they
aren't
in
the
statute
in
any
event
because
their
uses
were
so
far
beyond
the
solely
for
clause.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
let
me
see
if
i
understand
the
question.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
statute
doesn't
apply
to
medical
devices.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
they
are
a
medical
device,
and
so
they're
not...
no
matter
how
narrowly
they
conform
to
the
fda
solely
for...
if
they're
doing
nothing
but
testing
for
fda
purposes,
they're
not
within
that
exemption
because
they
are
a
medical
device
rather
than
a
drug.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
i...
i'm
not...
i'm
pausing
because
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
when
you
say
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute,
i
say
they
can't
use
it
for
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
but
maybe
if
i
said...
if
the
device
were
a
drug
and
then
if
they
solely
used
that...
let's
say
if
fda
had
said
this
device
is
a
drug
for
whatever
reason
and
then
they
limited
their
uses
to
the...
solely
to
uses
that
were
related
to
submission
and
fda
information,
then
they
would
not
any
longer
be
an
infringement
because
(e)(1)
says
we're
going
to
make
an
exception
regarding
certain
activities
from
section
271(a).
section
271(a)
is
a
very
broad
statute--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--that
says
any
manufacture,
use
or
sale
by
whoever
of
a
patented
invention
constitutes
an
infringement.
i
hope
i've
answered
that
question.
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
they
are
not,
your
honor.
they
are
regulated
under
a
different
department,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
department
of
agriculture,
and
under
an
act
called
the
virus,
serum
and
toxin
act.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
and
i
think
that's
a
further
support
that
when
congress
wants
to
talk
about...
if
they
want
to
include
an
entire
act,
they
refer
to
it.
in
fact,
they
had
referred
to
both
the
fd&c
act
and
the
virus,
serum
and
toxin
act
in
that--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--that's...
yes,
because
that's
the
only
thing
it
regulates.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
yes,
it
did.
it
was
in
a
parenthetical
clause,
and
it
started...
the
statute
read,
"it
shall
not
be
an
active
infringement
to
manufacture,
use
or
sell
a
patented
invention,
except
for,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
solely
for
uses.
"
and
that's
how
it
excluded
them.
and
then
in
'88--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--correct.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
by
"they"
you
mean
the
veterinary?
both
were
included,
your
honor,
because
the
term
drugs
is
a
broad...
is
defined
in
the
statute
and
includes
not
only
human
drugs
but
also
animal
drugs.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
and
also
veterinary
biological
products.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
there
was
an
eighth
circuit
en
banc
decision
which
actually
met
that
point
and
decided...
on
grand
laboratories,
i
believe...
that
veterinary
biologics
were
a
drug
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute.
medtronic
has
attempted...
i
should
suggest
there
is
a
very
good
reason,
although
you
don't
find
these
words
in
the
legislative
history,
why
drugs
were
appropriate
to
distinguish
from
devices
with
respect
to
the
exemption,
and
that's
because
of
the
real
world
differences
of
testing
a
drug,
a
bioequivalency
test
versus
a
medical
device.
in
a
bioequivalency
test,
quite
often,
the
drugs
are
administered
free
to
nonpatient
volunteers
on
a
short-term
basis.
no
"customers",
quote,
no
patients
are
used.
it's
not...
it's
not
a
long-term
thing.
in
this
case,
to
be
quite
specific,
we
have
four
competitors
who
may
seek
to
implant
as
many
as
200
units
at
$20,000
per
unit,
which
constitutes
a...
$16
millon
of
infringement,
all
in
the
name
of
experimentation.
i
suggest
that's
inappropriate
and
congress
never
intended
to
include
that
kind
of
activity
specifically
where
they
said
they
were
concerned
about
the
constitutional
issue
of
taking;
that
they
were
worried
that
this
271(e)(1)
would
take
patent
owners'
rights
where
a
patent
owner
had
already
surrendered
before
the
statute
a
full
disclosure
of
the
invention
in
exchange
for
this
specific
period
of
time.
and
congress
said...
the
legislative
history
said
we're
concerned
about
it,
but
it's
appropriate
to...
to
ignore
it
because
the
bioequivalency
testing
of
a
drug
is
de
minimis,
it's
very
small
activity.
in
no
way...
in
no
way
is
this
kind
of
activity--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--yes,
your
honor.
if
i...
i'll
use
it
in
a
drug,
because
that's
what
i
say
it
applies
to,
and
that's
what
congress
said
it
did.
in
a
drug...
if
i...
the
patent
has
two
years
to
run.
it's
a--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--a
drug
patent.
it
has
two
years
to
run,
and
i'm
a
generic
drug
company,
and
i
want
to
make
sure
that
on
the
day
the
patent
expires,
i
can
start
selling
my
generic
drug.
but
the
problem
is
i
need
an
approval
from
the
fda
to
do
that.
so,
to
get
the
approval,
i
have
to
take
the
drug
and
administer
it
to
a
small,
select
number
of
voluntary
patients
to
see
whether
the
drug
is
infused
at
the
same
rate
of
absorption
and
with
the
same
effectiveness
as
the
patented
drug.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
yes,
your
honor.
now--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--well,
if...
if
you...
what
you
were
doing
was
not
in
order
to...
solely
for
the
purposes
of
developing
and
submitting
the
information
for
the
fda,
then
even
your
testing
would
be...
would
not
be...
even
your
drug
testing
would
not
be
exempt
under
(e)(1).
it's
got
to
be
solely
for
the
purposes
reasonably
related
to
development
and
submission.
otherwise,
even
the
bioequivalency
test--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--under
a
federal
law
that
regulates
manufacture,
use
or
sale
of
drugs.
so,
in
other
words,
under
the
drug
statutes.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
now--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--your
honor,
this
statute
you
want
applies
to
both...
it
says
development
and
submission
of
information,
and
if
i...
if
i
misspoke
when
your
honor
asked
me
the
prior
question...
i
may
have
misspoken...
what...
what
i
meant
was
development
and
submission
of
information,
and
the
bioequivalency
person
must...
must'
do
that,
must
develop...
both
develop
and
submit
information.
but
i
should
say
this
statute
on
its
face
does
apply
to
more
than
simply
a
bioequivalency
type
of
test
drug.
it
applies
to
development
of
a
new
drug
as
well,
although
i
have
yet
to
see
a
specific
example
or
any
pragmatic
example
of
when
that
occurs,
when
a
new
pioneer
drug
might
infringe
the
pioneer
patent
of
an
earlier
pioneer
drug.
it
would
be
rare,
a
very
rare
instance
indeed,
i
think.
now,
medtronics
attempted
to
explain
the
absolute
void
in
the
legislative
history
of
271(e)(1)
by
stating
in
its
brief
that
the
void
is
equally
applicable,
not
only
to
(e)(1),
but
that
there
is
also
an
equal
void
with
respect
to
legislative
history
of
medical
devices
in
156.
in
fact,
medtronic's
brief
states,
"the
legislative
history
of
156
is
as
devoid
of
mention
of
devices
as
is
that
of
section
271(e)(1).
"
that
statement
is
pure,
unadulterated
fiction.
there
are
six
separate
references
in
the
legislative
history
of
section
156,
each
recognizing
that
156
is
a
medical
device,
drug,
color
additive
and
food
additive
extension.
there
are
no
separate
references,
no
references
whatsoever,
in
271(e)(1)
commenting
on
anything
other
than
drug
products.
medtronic,
as
i've
said,
doesn't
attempt
to
justify
the
reasoning
of
the
federal
circuit
opinion.
i
suggest
it's
because
it's
not
supportable.
instead,
they
raise
a
new
defense
called
experimental
use.
that
defense
has
been
waived.
it
was
never
raised
below.
it
was
never
raised
in
the
appellate
court.
it
wasn't
even
raised
in
our
petition
for
cert.--
there
are
also
policy
issues
that
medtronic
raises,
but
i
suggest
that
the
policy
issues
should
not
be
allowed
to
be
twisted
to
favor
copiers
over
inventors.
our
constitution
favors
invention,
not
copyists,
and
the
patent
in
this
suit,
the
757
patent,
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
benefits
of
federal
policy.
it's
saved
thousands
of
lives,
and
it's
brought
a
completely
new
therapy
to
our
field.
finally,
your
honors,
should
this
court
reverse
as
we
have
requested...
time
is
running
out
on
this
patent.
the
lawsuit
is
seven
years
old.
medtronic
has
been
allowed
to
infringe
for
six
of
those
seven
years.
the
patent
expires
in
just
eight
months.
i
request
that
this
court
order
the
immediate
reinstitution
of
the
injunction
in
place.
six
years
of
willful
infringement
is
enough.
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
the
term
drugs
embraces
like
glove
the
term
devices...
the
term
drugs
embraces
the
term
devices
like
a
glove
only
with
a
crowbar
and
a
hammer.
the
statute
specifically
defines
drugs
as
excluding
devices.
we've
heard
that
the
theme
of
congress,
the
theme
of
this
was
156
tradeoff
versus
medical
device
technology
coming
in.
congress
didn't
use
the
term
medical
device
technology.
congress
13
separate
times
used
the
term
drugs
or
drug
bioequivalency
testing.
so
i
suggest
that
what
we've
heard
about
the
theme
of
congress
in
the
tradeoff
is
totally
incorrect.
with
respect
to
the
use
of
the
term
patented
invention,
if
congress
used
the
term
drug
patent,
then...
then
processes
or
methods
regarding
drugs
might
not
have
been
included
as
well.
so
it
was
easier
to
use
the
very
terms
they
did,
"development
and
submission
under
a
federal
law
regulating
manufacture,
use
or
sale
of
drugs.
"
to
be
drug
specific.
only...
only
in
our
wildest
dreams
would
congress
have
used
a...
one
term
which
defined
as
excluding
another
for
the
purpose
of
including
the
other.
now,
regarding
the
(e)(1)
and
(e)(2)
dichotomy,
there
are
two
reasons.
first,
if
drugs...
if
devices
aren't
in
(e)(2),
then
a
medical
device
company
can
come
in
and
get
approval
two
years
before
the
patent
expires,
knowing
that
preliminary
injunctions
are
rarely
granted
and
no
suit
can
be
filed
during
that
period.
the
suit's
filed
with
two
years
left
to
run
natural
delays
occur
like
the
ones
medtronic
caused
in
this
lawsuit,
and
what
we
wind
up
with
is
no
effective
protection,
no
injunction.
that's
what
(e)(2)
is
there
for.
it
was
to
stop
people
from
going
and
getting
approval
ahead
of
time
in
an
improper
way.
and
it
would
be
a
bizarre
and
unfair
concoction
to
have
medical
devices
construed
into
(e)(1)
where
it's
not
there
and
also
not
be
in
section
(e)(2).
for
all
the
reasons
i've
explained
earlier,
i
think
it's
most
urgent
that
we
request
that
medtronic's
delay
be
stopped
and
that
if
this
decision
is
reversed--
mr.
timothy
j.
malloy
--thank
you.
