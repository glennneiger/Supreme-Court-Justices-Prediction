justice
white
well,
the
court
though
so
too,
didn't
it?
justice
white
mr.
malloy,
am
i
right
the
critical
language
of
the
statute
is,
"a
federal
law
which
regulates
the
manufacture,
use
or
sale
of
drugs?
"
justice
white
no,
under...
well,
but
is
the
last
language...
i...
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
have
the
last
part
of
the
language
correct.
justice
white
"which
regulates
the
manufacture,
use
or
sale
of
drugs.
"
justice
white
thank
you.
justice
white
well,
does
that
apply
also
to
the
veterinary
biological
products?
justice
white
well,
it's
there,
though.
justice
white
but
271(e)(1)
has
that...
those
words
in
it,
does
it
not?
justice
white
and
for
the
same
reason?
justice
white
well,
what
was
the...
what
was
the
claimed
infringement
here?
justice
white
yes,
but
what
were
they
using
it
for?
justice
white
well,
i
thought
that
if
it's...
if
it's...
if
it
was
used
solely...
in
order
to...
not
to
be
an
infringement,
it
would
have
to
be
used
solely
for
uses
reasonably
related
to
the
development
of
information
that
had
to
be
filed?
justice
white
well,
that
may
be...
that
may
be
so,
but...
but
you...
you...
the
argument
you're
making
that
even
if
it
was
for
the
purpose
stated
in
this
exemption
section,
that
would
still
be
an
infringement?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
i
understand...
i
understand
that.
but
if
they
were
using
this
device
for
the...
for
the
purpose
that
would
give
them
an
exemption,
you
still
that
it's
an
infringement?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
you're...
you're...
you're
saying
what
this
exemption
doesn't...
doesn't
cover,
but
give
me
an
example
of
something
that
is...
give
me
an
example
of
the
use
of
a
patented
invention
that
is
exempt
under
this
section.
justice
white
what
patent,
a
drug
patent?
justice
white
so,
you
say
the
patented
invention
that...
that
won't
be
infringed
under
this
section
is
a
patent
on
a
drug,
is
that
all?
justice
white
is
that
all?
justice
white
and
it
isn't...
and
it
isn't...
it
isn't
that...
that
the
information
that
you
have
to
furnish
is...
must
be
for
the
development
of
a
drug?
justice
white
the
development
and
submission
of
information
about
what?
justice
white
it
would
have
to
be...
your
information
would
have
to
be
relevant
to
the
development
of
a
drug?
justice
white
excuse
me.
the
patent...
the
invention
has
to
be
a
drug
patent,
is
that--
justice
white
--was
the...
was
it
determined
in
the
case
that
the
use
made
of
this
patented
invention
satisfied
the
last
part
of
this
exemption?
justice
white
well,
that...
you
mean
if
we
agreed
with
you
the
issue
is
still
open
as
to
whether
or
not
six
years
of
this
testing
was
for
the
purpose
indicated
by
the
exclusion?
justice
white
why
does
[inaudible]
say
testing?
justice
white
of
information.
justice
white
at
the
front
end?
