why
is
it
that
in
answering
the
chief
justice's
first
question
you
were
insistent
that
the
critical
words
of
the
statute
include
"solely
for
uses
reasonably
related
to
the
development
submission?
"
would
you
tell
us
that?
justice
black
you're...
you're...
excuse
me.
are
you
saying
that
under
a
federal
law
means
under...
under
a
federal
law
requiring
development
and
submission?
so,
you
say
it
refers
to
the
particular
section
of
the
law?
is
that
your
position?
