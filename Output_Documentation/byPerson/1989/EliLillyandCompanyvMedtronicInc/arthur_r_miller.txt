mr.
arthur
r.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
members
of
the
court,
may
it
please
the
court:
if
the
court
will
bear
with
me,
i
would
like
to
attempt
on
medtronic's
behalf
to
pursue
its
plain
meaning
argument
with
regard
to
271(e)(1).
the
statute
says,
"it
shall
not
be
an
act
of
infringement
to
make,
use
or
sell
a
patented
invention.
"
those
words,
mr.
malloy
in
his
argument.
271(a),
the
basic
infringement
provision
in
the
patent
act.
the
words
"patented
invention"
mean
every
patented
invention.
what
this
statute
says
is
that
it
is
not
an
infringement
to
use
any
patented
invention
for
uses
reasonably
related
to
the
development
and
submission
of
information
under
a
federal
law
which
regulates
drugs.
those
are
the
words
congress
chose
to
write.
clearly,
the
lilly
device
is
a
patented
invention.
there's
no
debate
on
that.
it
requires
no
discussion.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
absolutely,
justice.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
if
it
met
the
qualification
at
the
end--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--of
the
section.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
the
reason
it
does
make
sense
is
what
congress
was
trying
to
legislate
here
was
the
intersection
between
patent
law
and
drug
regulation
and
device
regulation
and
additive
regulation.
discontinuities
had
grown
up,
time
alterations
had
grown
up
since
the
beginning
of
the
regulation
of
these
devices.
the
mandatory
testing
requirements
of
the
fda
caused
a
long
period
of
time
to
expire
during
the
patent
of
a
drug,
a
device
or
an
additive.
congress
was
trying
to
correct
that
situation
and
simultaneously
correct
the
situation
at
the
back
end
of
the
patent,
which
required
the
next
comer
to
the
marketplace
to
engage
in
its
own
fda-mandated
testing.
so,
you
had
a
foreshortening
of
the
patent
at
the
front
because
of
fda-mandated
testing,
you
had
an
elongation
at
the
back
because
of
fda
testing.
so
the
words
"patented
invention"
are
designed
to
embrace
all
of
the
patented
items
that
are
impacted
by
fda-mandated
testing.
a
federal
law
which
regulates
drugs
is
a
federal
law
which
regulates
drugs.
the
fdca,
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act,
is
plainly
a
federal
law
which
regulates
drugs.
now,
if
i
stopped
right
here,
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
is
obvious.
if
you've
got
a
patented
invention,
whatever
it
may
be,
device
or
drug,
and
if
you
are
testing
it
under
a
federal
law
which
regulates
drugs,
your
testing
is
exempt.
it
is
not
an
infringing
act.
that
is
the
plain
meaning
of
this
statute.
now,
lilly
argues
on
the
basis
of
a
statute
that
congress
did
not
write.
lilly's
argument
requires
the
transformation
of
one
or
more
words.
lilly
argues
that
the
statute
only
applies
to
drugs.
the
statute
does
not
say
it
applies
only
to
drugs.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
that
is
lilly's
position.
the
words
271(a)
and
in
101
certainly
are
not
limited
to
drugs.
if
congress
wanted
to
limit
this
exemption
to
drugs
it
would
have
said
make,
use
or
sell
a
drug
or
a
drug
patent
or
a
drug-related
patent
or
a
human
drug
patent.
why
would
it
have
used
the
embracive
words
"patented
invention"?
one
of
lilly's
responses
is
that
that
last
word
at
the
end
of
the
sentence,
"drugs",
modifies
patented
invention.
that
is
syntactically
impossible.
drug
modifies
federal
law
under
any
standard
of
construction.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
that
issue
is
technically
still
open
because
the
legal
question
of
whether
this
statute
applied
to
devices
has
preempted
that.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
if
you
decide,
as
medtronics
contends,
that
this
statute
applies
to
devices,
it
is
still
open
for
the
district
court
to
inquire
as
to
whether
the
particular
implants
achieved
by
medtronic
were
for
the
use
specified
in
the
statute.
that
issue
has...
there
is
nothing
final
on
that
question
yet.
now--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--several
points,
your
honor.
if
you
look
at
(e)(2),
it
shows
you
exactly
how
congress
could
write
and
did
write
a
provision
that
only
applies
to
drugs.
it
says
drug.
it
says
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
it
even
defines
drug.
if
(e)(1)
applied
only
to
drugs,
this
is
the
way
congress
would
have
written
(e)(1)
with
words
relating
to
drugs,
with
cross-references...
note
the
cross-reference
in
(e)(2)
to
505
of
the
fdca,
a
specific
cross-reference
to
a
particular
provision.
(e)(2)
demonstrates
that
(e)(1)
with
its
reference--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--to
patented
invention.
(e)(1)
with
its
sort
of
broad
encompassing
of
all
federal
laws
relating
to
drugs
is
a
much
broader
provision
than
the
very
narrow
exception
to
the
exception
which
lies
in
(e)(2).
now,
why
you
ask?
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
we'll
fight
for
any
advantage,
justice.
(e)(2)
is
unique
to
drugs.
as...
as
mr.
malloy
said,
the
genesis
of
this
'84
statute
lies
in
a
fight
between
the
generic
drug
industry
and
the
so-called
pioneer
drug
industry.
the
generic
drug
industry
was
given
the
so-called
andas,
these
abbreviated
new
drug
applications
which
would
enable
them
to
get
to
market
faster.
the
pioneer
drug
industry,
however,
wanted
some
procedural
safeguards
against
too
rapid
an
anda,
one
that
cleared
the
fda
before
the
patent
expired.
so
(e)(2)
and
(e)(4)
are
concessions
to
the
pioneers
to
provide
them
with
a
notice
and
litigation
opportunity
in
case
they
got
snookered.
that's
totally
irrelevant
to
the
device
industry.
the
device
industry
does
not
have
that
dichotomy
between
pioneers
and
generics.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
others.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
the
only
things
that
are
included
as
a
practical
matter
are
drugs,
devices,
additives,
because
the
second
defect
with
petitioner's
argument
as
to
why
they
used
drugs
in
(e)(1)
is
that
drugs
is
the
perfect
descriptor.
the
word
1984
two
acts:
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
and
the
public
health
service
act.
those
are
the
only
two
acts
that
deal
with
the
submission
of
test
data
regarding
patented
inventions.
and
they
only
deal
with
drugs,
devices
and
additives.
the
word
drugs
embraces
those
two
like
a
glove.
there
is
no
device
statute,
and
there
is
no
additive
statute.
basically
there's
the
fdca,
which
everybody
calls
the
drug
statute,
and
the
public
health
service
act.
now,
mr.
malloy
twice
and
in
footnote
2
of
his
reply
brief,
makes
this
very
catchy
argument
that
gee,
congress
could
have
used
the
word
additive
rather
than
drug,
trying
to
suggest
how
stupid
that
construction
is.
no,
congress
could
not
have
used
the
word
additive
or
cosmetic
or
device.
it
could
only
have
used
the
word
drug
to
achieve
its
purpose
because
only
the
word
drug
embraces
both
the
fdca
and
the
public
health
service
act.
if
you
used
additive,
cosmetic
or
device,
the
statute
would
have
a
shortfall.
so
drug
is
the
perfect
descriptor.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
to
my
understanding,
justice
scalia,
there
is
no
gap.
the
words
work.
the
problem
with
the
petitioner's
argument
is
that
you
have
to
interpolate
words
that
are
not
in
the
statute.
you've
somehow
got
to
interpolate
that
patented
invention
means
drug-related
invention.
you
cannot
do
that.
you've
got
to
interpolate
the
words
under
the
information
submission
procedures
of
a
law
relating
to
drugs.
those
words
are
not
there.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
the
one
itty,
bitty
subsection.
the
problem
with
that,
justice
scalia
is
that
when
you
go
through
the
fdca
you
discover
that
devices
and
drugs
are
intermingled.
if
you
take
a
look
at
331,
which
we
believe
is
the
core
regulatory
provision,
you
find
that
drugs
and
devices
are
tied
like
knots.
and
if
congress
wanted
to
achieve
that
result,
it
would
have
been
so
easy
for
it
to
insert
the
words
under
the
drug
submission
provisions
of
a
federal
law
relating
to
drugs.
the
point
is
those
words
are
not
there.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
your
hypothetical
statute
about
missiles
can
be
handled
exactly
the
way
the
congress
handled
the
addition
of
animal
drugs
and
veterinary
biological
products
in
1988.
that
is,
by
adding
them
to
156,
the
extension
provision,
and
then
tucking
them
into
271(e)(1).
now,
that's
worth
a
bit
of
note.
when
congress
did
that
in
'88,
notice
veterinary
biological
products
are
regulated
by
the
toxin...
toxin,
serum
act...
the
virus,
toxic
serum
act.
congress
didn't
say
the
virus,
toxin
serum
act
in
1988.
it
says
a
federal
law
which
regulates
veterinary
biological
products.
notice
in
'84
they
used
drugs
as
a
generic
descriptor.
in
'88
they
used
veterinary
biological
products
as
a
generic
descriptor
not
identifying
the
statutes
by
name.
i
can't
put
my
mind
into
the
mind
of
the
people
who
drafted
that
but
it
is
plausible
to
say...
it
is
plausible
to
say
that
they
were
using
the
more
generalized
language
simply
because
congress
might
then
enact
another
drug
law
or
another
veterinary
biological
products
law.
and
271(e)(1)
would
then
act
as
a
receptor.
now,
let...
let
me
broaden
this
a
little
bit
and
get...
get
back
from
the
words.
let's
look
at
the
context
of
the
statute.
i
think
it
is
exceedingly
important
to
look
at
the
context.
the
'84
statute
was
a
very
important
statute.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
it
was
designed
to
achieve
three
objectives.
one,
the
drug
companies
who
were
before
congress
at
that
time
were
claiming
loss
of
patent
because
of
the
elongated
testing
required
by
the
fda.
so,
congress
wanted
to
stimulate
innovation.
congress
also
made
it
clear
it
wanted
to
promote
competition
in
the
medical
field
on
expiration
of
the
patent,
and
congress
also
made
it
clear
that
it
wanted
to
restore
some
definiteness
about
patent
expiration.
the
problem
with
the
testing
was
you
never
knew
when
it
would
end,
and
if
you
couldn't...
if
you
couldn't
start,
you
were
just
left
in
limbo.
what
congress
did
in
'84
was
say
okay,
all
of
you
medical
people,
all
of
you
drug
people,
all
of
you
device
people,
all
of
you
additive
people,
you're
going
to
get
an
extension,
and
an
elaborate
scheme
was
established
in
156
to
give
them
the
extension.
then
congress
said,
but
that's
it.
that's
it.
congress
quite
clearly
said
there
shall
be
no
other
direct
or
indirect
extension
of
patent.
that's
what
271
was
all
about.
congress
said
you
people...
and
it
named
them
all
in
156...
you
get
an
extension,
but
you
competitors,
you
can
test
during
the
patent
period
so
that
when
this
extended
patent
ends,
you're
prepared
to
compete,
to
enter
the
marketplace
to
bring
these
health
products
to
test--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--no,
chief
justice.
the
statute
allows
the
testing...
and
that's
all
it
is,
just
testing...
to
occur
during
the
patent
period.
so
it's
theoretically
possible
that
somebody
might
start
testing
in
the
first
year,
but
won't
be
able
to
commercialize
it
until
17
plus
extension.
now,
it's
important
to
understand
that
the
patent
term
is
17
years,
the
theoretical
potential
extension
is
five
years.
that's
22
years.
and
in
271
congress
said
that's
it,
because
we're
going
to
allow
people
to
test
so
after
22
years
they
can
get
to
market
and
bring
the
drugs
and
devices
and
the
additives
to
people.
and
right
in
that
legislative
history
is
the
clearest
possible
statement.
there
shall
be
no
other
direct
or
indirect
extensions,
clear
reference
to
the
fact
that
we're
giving
you
something
at
the
front
end.
we
are
in
effect
recognizing
in
271(e)(1)
a
free
to
use,
a
freedom
to
use
solely
for
testing,
not
for
marketing.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
submission
and
development
means--
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
--yes,
yes.
that's
the
compliance
with,
the
compliance
with
the
fda
mandates
which
includes
as
in
this
case,
justice
white,
clinical
tests.
you
cannot
get
a
pacemaker
onto
the
market
until
you've
gone
through
fda
clinical
testing.
you
see,
what
we
have
here
is
an
absolutely
fortuitous
patent
extension
created
by
the
dictates
of
fda-mandated
testing
that's
an
artificial
barrier
to
market
entry
and...
and
we
believe
the
congress
said
as
to
all
three
categories,
we're
going
to
give
you
the
extension,
but
this
artificial
barrier
simply
must
come
down
so
we
can
get
definiteness
of
patent
term
and
we
can
get
marketplace
competition.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
because
there
was
a...
a
demonstration
before
congress
that
the
fda-mandated
testing
was
in
effect
cutting
into
the
patent
monopoly.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
that's
right.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
yes,
yes,
yes.
now,
the
we
believe
absurdity
of
the
lilly
position
is
that
if
271(e)(1)
does
not
permit
device
companies
to
test
as
drug
companies
can
test,
in
effect
the
whole
scheme
of
the
1984
act
is
destroyed.
it
leads
to
the
absurd
result
that
device
companies
are
given
double
extensions.
they
can
dip
into
the
156
extension
and
then
say
271(e)(1),
as
lilly
is
saying
this
case
doesn't
apply
to
you,
medtronics,
which
means
that
theoretically
a
device
company
would
get
17
years
plus
five
years
plus
two,
four,
six
additional
years,
while
the
next
comer
would
be
testing
if
you
exclude
device
companies
from
271(e)(1).
it
simply
makes
no
sense
from
a
policy
perspective.
it
makes
no
sense
in
terms
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish
in
'84.
i
submit
to
you
that
is
exactly
why
271(e)(1),
its
plain
language,
says
patented
invention
for
uses
under
a
federal
law
which
regulates
drugs
embraces
devices
as
well
as
drugs.
there
are
numerous
other
arguments.
mr.
malloy
has
said
well,
the
reason
congress
has
distinguished
between
devices
and
drugs
is
because
devices
are
tested
differently.
medtronic
charged
$17,000
for
its
pacemaker
implants.
drugs
you
don't
charge.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
medtronic's
charges
of
$17,000
is
authorized
by
the
fda.
the
fda
has
in
its
regulations
made
a
policy
decision
that
device
manufacturers
can
charge
because
of
the
cost
of
the
devices,
the
cost
of
the
devices;
that
if
device
manufacturers
could
not
recoup
a
little
of
their
investment,
small
device
companies
simply
could
not
test.
they
simply
could
not
afford.
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
although
$17,000
per
device
sounds
like
a
lot
of
money,
it
is
a
small
fraction
first
of
the
research
development
and
manufacturing
costs
of
medtronics.
these
clinical
trials
are
staggeringly
expensive.
many
of
the
implants
are
not
charged.
they
are
not
charged
in
part
because
some
of
them
go
into
animals,
and
it's
hard
to
make
fido
pay.
some
of
them
are
used
for
ladder
tests,
which
are
just
dropping
tests,
and
some
of
them
simply
are
not
collected.
there
is
no
real
distinction
between
drugs
and
devices.
the
few
devices
that
must
be
tested...
less
than
10
percent
of
all
devices
are
tested.
only
the
highly
risky
devices.
nobody
tests
bedpans
and
scalpels.
the
only
devices
that
are
tested
are
things
like
prosthetic
devices,
artificial
valves,
pacemakers.
the
number
of
devices
that
will
fall
under
271(e)(1)
is
relatively
small,
and
any
notion
that
there
is
a
significant
marketplace
difference
between
drugs,
which
are
typically
run
over
1,000
or
2,000
people
and
devices
which
are
typically
run
over
50
or
100
people,
that
distinction
does
not
wash.
there's
no
evidence
of
it
before
congress.
congress
never
tried
to
draw
a
distinction
based
on
devices
versus
drugs.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
all
generic
drugs
must
go
through
bioequivalency
testing.
that
can
be
a
significant
test
on
a
lot
of
people
and
take
a
lot
of
time.
271(e)(2)
is
designed
to
protect
the
pioneer
against
the
generic
who's
going
to
do
that
bioequivalency
testing
and
try
to
slip
through
that
anda
and
get
approval
before
patent
expiration.
other
than
the
handful
of
highly
risky,
highly
intrusive
devices
like
the
pacemaker
that
we're
talking
about
today,
none
of
the
other
devices
get
tested.
fda
has
no
resources,
there's
no
ability
to
test
the
rest.
all
that
happens,
unlike
the
generics
which
are
tested,
is
that
the
device
manufacturer
files
a
notice
of
substantial
equivalence
with
the
fda
and
goes
to
market.
there
is
no
context
comparable
to
the
(e)(2)/(e)(4)...
situation
in
the
device
field.
there
is
no
testing
as
there
is
testing
for
generics.
there's
no
anda.
either
you
fall
into
the
so-called
class
iii,
like
the
pacemaker,
where
you
go
through
clinical
tests
of
enormous
duration
where
there's
no
risk
of
an
abbreviated
pre-market
approval,
or
you
just
go
to
market
after
you've
filed
your
notice.
so
there's...
there
just
is
nothing
comparable
between
the
non-class
iii
device
companies
and
the
generic
drug
companies.
mr.
arthur
r.
miller
that
is
right.
if
you...
if
you
have
gone
to
market,
you
will
be
sued
for
infringement,
and
that...
that...
in
other
words,
there
is
no
need
to
protect
the
device
company
as
there
is
a
need
to
protect
the
pioneer
against
the
sleazy
generic.
