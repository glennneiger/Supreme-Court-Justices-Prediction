justice
scalia
is
there
a
question
of
the
food...
food
and
drug
act
that
requires
the
development
and
submission
of
information
only
relating
to
drugs?
justice
scalia
then
wouldn't
the
natural
way
to
explain
the
position,
say
under
section
355
of
the
act,
if
it
means
what
you
say?
justice
scalia
and
that's
the
meaning
you're...
you're
saying
that's
what
the
statute
really
means?
justice
scalia
well,
were
they
in
it
when
it
was
first
enacted?
justice
scalia
--well,
but...
but...
but...
but
then
it
went
on
the
way
it
is
now,
solely
for
use
as
reasonable
related
to
the
development
under
the
federal
law
which
regulates
the
manufacture,
use
or
sale
of
drugs
did
it
say?
justice
scalia
of
drugs.
but
then...
but
under
your
theory
they
wouldn't
have
been
included
under
that
anyway,
and
there
wouldn't
have
been
a
need
to
exclude
them
in
the
parenthetical.
justice
scalia
and
also--
justice
scalia
--okay.
justice
scalia
is
that
an
expansive
term
in...
in...
in
your
belief,
a
federal
law
that
regulates
drugs
so
that
if
a
future
law
is
enacted
that
regulates
drugs,
it
would
also
fall
within
this?
justice
scalia
so,
if
congress
made
the
mistake
of
having
a
law
that
has
drugs
and
also
supersonic
missiles
in
the
same
law,
then
any
patents
on
supersonic
missiles
would
also
come
under
this
exception?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
and
that
doesn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
sense.
justice
scalia
mr.
miller,
what
about
subsection
2,
(e)(2)?
it
seems
to
me
this
is
sort
of
a
bad-faith
exception
to
the...
to
(1).
and
it
seems...
it
seems
to
me
that
that
bad-faith
exception...
that
is
to
say
you're
submitting
the
information,
you're
developing
and
submitting
information,
but
your
real
purpose
is...
is...
is
to
develop
the
product
and
sell
it
before
the
patent
expires.
you're
a
bad
actor.
i
don't
see
why
that
exception
wouldn't
have
been
extended
to
everything
that
(e)(1)
covers,
and
it
seems
very
strange
for
that
exception
in
(e)(2)
to
cover
only...
only
exactly
what
mr.
malloy
contends
(e)(1)
covers
exclusively,
namely
drugs
and...
and
veterinary
biological
products.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
you're
finally
coming
to
answer
may
question,
having
made
the
point
you
wanted
to
make.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
yeah,
but
it
isn't...
it
isn't
only
devices
that
we're
talking
about
that
are
covered
by
(1)
but
not
covered
by
(2).
justice
scalia
there
are...
there
are
other
elements
that
are
brought
in
by
your
broad
interpretation
of
(1)
to
include
everything
under
the...
under
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act.
justice
scalia
can
i
be
sure
i
understand
your
answer
to
my
question?
you...
you
say
that
there
is
nothing
that
comes
within
the
exemption
of
(e)(1),
and
that
would
have
been
subject
to
these
expedited
approval
procedures
which
(e)(2)
is
directed
to.
there's
nothing
except
the
things
that
are
in
fact
covered
by
(e)(2).
there's--
justice
scalia
--there's
no
gap?
justice
scalia
or
you
could
just
interpret
federal
law
to
mean
a
federal
statute,
not
the
whole
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act,
just
as,
you
know,
it
wouldn't
be
all
of
title
35,
just
the...
the
one
law.
justice
scalia
it
would
have
been
very
easy
to
say
which
regulate...
instead
of
under
a
federal
law
which
regulates
the
manufacture,
use
or
sale
of
drugs
you
could
have
said
under
the...
under
the
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act
and
the
second
act
that
you're
concerned
about.
if
you
want
to
talk
about
being
easy,
wouldn't
that
have
been
a
lot
easier
than
this,
which
will
pick
up
my...
my
hypothetical
statute
about
missiles?
justice
scalia
mr.
miller,
can
i
come
back
to
(e)(2)?
i'm
really
hung
up
on
(e)(2).
i'm
sorry.
the
response
that...
that
petitioner's
reply
brief
makes
to
what...
to
what
you
said
about
(e)(2)
is
that
while
there
are
no
abbreviated
applications
for...
for
medical
devices,
there...
it
is
the
case
that
they
do
not
all
require
full
pre-market
clinical
trials
prior
to
marketing
so
that
they
are
subject
to
the
kinds
of
abuses
that...
that
(e)(2)
seems
to
be
directed
at.
i...
i...
i
just
find
it
very
strange
that...
i
mean,
that's
such
a...
that's
such
a
bad-faith
provision
in
(e)(2).
you
would
think
that
you'd
be
sure
to
cover
everybody
who's
trying
to
get
out
of...
out
of
(e)(1)
in
that
provision.
and
if
i
have
any
doubt
that
there's
something
left
out,
which
it
seems
to
me
there
is,
i
wonder
what
(e)(1)
means.
justice
scalia
can
you
go
to
market
after
filing
notice,
you
wouldn't
come
under
(e)(1)
anyway
because
there's...
because
there's
nothing
related
to
the
development
and
submission
of
information,
is
that
you're
point?
