justice
stevens
well,
how
do
you...
how
do
you
answer
the
argument,
though,
that
the
law...
the
federal
food
and
drug
act,
or
whatever
the...
the
federal
drug,
cosmetic
and
so
forth...
is
a
law
regulating
the
sale
of
drugs?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but
is
it
not
a
law
regulating
the
sale
of
drugs?
justice
stevens
well--
justice
stevens
--your
position
is
the
federal
food
and
drug
act
is
not
a
law
relating...
regulating
the
sale
of
drugs?
justice
stevens
what
it
means,
in
other
words,
is
the
provisions
of
the
law
regulating
drugs,
which
regulate
drugs?
justice
stevens
you're
saying
it
should
be...
it's
meant
to
read
"under
any
provision
of
the
law
regulating
drugs,
which
provisions
also
regulate
drugs.
"
justice
stevens
anything
else
covered
by
the
statute
regulating
drugs
is
their
position.
justice
stevens
and
your
position
is
covered
by
the
portions
of
the
statute
regulating
drugs
that
do
regulate
drugs?
the
portions
that
regulate
drugs.
justice
stevens
they
did
not
mean
law
regulating
drugs.
they
meant
portion
of
law
regulating
drugs.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
justice
white's
question
prompted.
are
veterinary
biological
products
regulated
under
the
federal
food,
drug
and
cosmetic
act?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
they
don't
in
this...
in
this
statute.
they
just
refer
to...
they...
they
describe
it
by
the
fact
that
it's
the
federal
law
regulating
veterinary
biological
products.
they
don't
use
the
name
of
the
statute,
do
they?
justice
stevens
yeah.
i
see.
you
said,
mr.
malloy,
that
in...
in
'84
271(e)(1)
excluded
human
drug
and
veterinary
biological
products.
how
did
it
exclude
them?
did
it
explicitly
state
that
it
excluded
them
or
did--
