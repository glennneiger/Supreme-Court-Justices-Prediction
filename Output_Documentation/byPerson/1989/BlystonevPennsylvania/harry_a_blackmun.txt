justice
blackmun
mr.
attorney
general,
just
a
matter
of
curiosity,
how
many
people
are
on
death
row
in
pennsylvania?
justice
blackmun
have
there
been
any
executions
up
there
recently?
justice
blackmun
and
yet
you
haven't
really
enforced
it,
have
you?
justice
blackmun
i
say,
yet
you
haven't
really
enforced
it,
have
you?
justice
blackmun
of
course
there
are
those,
i
think
mr.
justice
powell
among
others,
who
have
said
if
you
are
going
to
have
a
death
penalty
you
ought
to
enforce
it.
you
have
on
death
row
the
number
of
people
equal
to
half
of
those
in
this
room.
justice
blackmun
when
did
this
crime
take
place?
justice
blackmun
so
that
it...
it's
comparatively
recent
compared
to
a
lot
of
other
cases
that
are
pending
across
the
country.
