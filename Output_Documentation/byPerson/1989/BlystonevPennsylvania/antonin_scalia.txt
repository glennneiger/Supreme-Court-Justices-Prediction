justice
scalia
i
guess
i
am
just
repeating
what
justice
kennedy
suggested,
but
you're...
you're...
you're
sounding
like
the
opposition
in
furman.
wasn't
furman
directed
exactly
against
leaving
it
up
to
the
jury
whether
in
a
broad
category
of
cases
you
want
to
impose
the
death
sentence?
justice
scalia
and
here
you're
saying
that
that
is
really
what
we
ought
to
do,
leave
it
up
to
the
jury.
justice
scalia
that's
not
what
they
said.
they
didn't
say
too
many
people
are
eligible
for
death.
what
they
were
concerned
about,
quite
the
contrary,
was
like
situations
being
treated
differently.
and
what
we
were
trying
to
develop
was
a
system
in
which
that
kind
of
inequity,
insofar
as
possible,
wouldn't
occur.
and
here
pennsylvania
has
created
one.
it
says
we
decide
what
is
aggravating.
if
you
find
it,
and
if
you
find
no
mitigating
circumstances,
every
jury
should
impose
the
death
sentence.
justice

[inaudible]
justice
scalia
i'm...
i'm
not
sure,
is...
is
it
really
the
same
circumstance?
it
seems
to
me
the
aggravating
circumstance
is
that
he
stole
money.
and
the
mitigating
is
that
he
didn't...
didn't
steal
more
than
$13.
i
don't
know
that
it's
the
same
one.
i
don't
know...
the
fact
that
he
stole
$13,
as
such.
the
fact
that
he
stole
is
mitigating;
the
fact
that
he
didn't
steal
more...
i'm
sorry.
the
fact
that
he
stole
is
aggravating,
the
fact
that
he
didn't
steal
more
than
13
is
mitigating.
i
wouldn't...
you
really
want
to
concede
that...
that
it's
the
same
factor
being
used
both
ways?
justice
scalia
it
is
not
a
significant
history,
even
though
it
mandates
the
death
penalty
if
it's
found.
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
the
manslaughter
conviction
would
not
be
a
mitigating
factor.
the
mitigating
factor
is
that
he
didn't
have
any
other
convictions
beyond
the
manslaughter
conviction.
justice
scalia
the
manslaughter
conviction
is
an
aggravating
one.
the
fact
that
he
didn't
have
any
others
is
a
mitigating
one.
