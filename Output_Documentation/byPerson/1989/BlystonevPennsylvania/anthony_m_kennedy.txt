justice
kennedy
so,
in
your
view,
i
take
it,
if
in
pennsylvania,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
this
is
the
case,
the
killing
of
a
police
officer
in
the
line
of
duty
is
an
aggravating
circumstance,
you
think
the
constitution
requires
a
system
in
which
the
jury
can
find
no
mitigating
circumstances,
and
then
say
well,
really
i
don't
think
killing
a
police
officer
is
a
crime
that
deserves
the
death
penalty.
you,
constitutionally,
you
say
that
that
is
constitutionally
required,
that
the
jury
has
that
authority.
justice
kennedy
well,
what
about
the
case
that
i
put?
they
find
no
mitigating
circumstances,
but
some
jurors
think
well,
killing
a
police
officer
in
the
line
of
duty
is
really
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
we
should
impose
the
death
penalty
for.
you
think
the
constitution
requires
that
the
jury
have
that
kind
of
authority
to
second-guess
the
legislature?
justice
kennedy
well,
the
facts
are
all
mitigating
circumstances
under
section
8
of
the
pennsylvania
code.
i
am
asking
you,
in
my
case,
whether
the
jury
could
say
that
in
their
view
killing
a
police
officer,
as
an
abstract
matter--
justice
kennedy
--is
simply
not
the
kind
of
crime
that
calls
for
the
death
penalty.
justice
kennedy
all
right.
that
is
your
position.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
exactly
contrary
to
what
we
required
in
furman
v.
georgia.
and
it
seems
to
me
then,
then
we
have
gone
absolutely
full
circle.
justice
kennedy
because
of
the
particular
case.
justice
kennedy
well,
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question,
i...
i
assume
that
if
the
state
were
trying
to
show
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstances,
it
could
introduce
much
of
this
evidence,
i...
i.e.,
to
show
that
he
was
not
acting
under
extreme
emotional
or
mental
disturbance
when
he
went
back
and...
and
told
his
accomplices
in
the
car
that
he
was
going
to
kill
the
victim,
and...
and
then
discussed
it
with
the
victim
for
a
while.
i
assume
that
is
all
relevant
to
show
that
there
is
no
mitigating
circumstance.
justice
kennedy
they
could
do
it
in
rebuttal.
does
it
have
to
be
in
rebuttal?
can
you,
under
this
law,
the
state,
as
part
of
your
case
on
direct
in
the
sentencing
hearing,
show
no
mitigating
circumstances?
do
you
attempt
to
do
that?
justice
kennedy
does
the
state...
does
the
state
show
absence
of
mitigating
circumstances
in
its
case
in
chief
in
the
sentencing
hearing?
