justice
stevens
mr.
gettleman,
i
have
some
difficulty
understanding
how
this
argument
relates
to
the
question
we
granted
certiorari
to
decide.
justice
stevens
is
whether
the
mandatory
feature
of
the
statute
requires
death
when
there
is
one
aggravating
circumstance
and
no
mitigating
circumstance
is
valid.
justice
stevens
and
so
we
are
assuming
for
purpose
of
decision
there
are
no
mitigating
circumstances.
justice
stevens
xxx
your
question.
justice
stevens
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
i
don't
see
how
that
is
relevant
to
the
question
you
presented
in
your
certiorari
petition.
justice
stevens
what
was
the
aggravating
circumstance
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
what...
what
was
the...
what
was
the
aggravating,
what...
what...
this
was
a
robbery,
was
it
not?
justice
stevens
was
the
robbery--
justice
stevens
--a
$13
robbery
from
the--
--it
wasn't
felony
murder,
was
it?
it
was
murder
in
the
course
of
committing
a
felony.
justice
stevens
well,
they
clearly
here,
as
i
understand
the
statute,
clearly
had
to...
assuming
they
didn't
find
mitigating
circumstances,
the
fact
that
the
defendant,
rather
than
one
of
the
other
occupants
of
the
car,
stole
the
$13
from
the
victim
is
what
not
only
authorized
the
death
penalty,
but
actually
mandated
it.
if
there
had
been
no...
if
he
had
not
taken
the
$13,
there
could
not
have
been
a
death
penalty
in
this
case,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
but
he
had...
assume
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
robbery
of
the
$13.
then
he
couldn't
have
gotten
the
death
penalty,
could
he?
justice
stevens
assume
he
didn't...
if
somebody
didn't
even
know
the
13--
justice
stevens
--so,
not
only
probably
not,
the
aggravating
circumstance
that
authorized
and
also
required
the
death
penalty
in
this
case
was
the
fact
that
he
was
found
guilty
of
the
$13
robbery.
justice
stevens
and
all
the
other
facts
are
irrelevant
to
the...
all
the
other
aggravating
circumstances
are
irrelevant
to
the
death...
to
the
penalty
determination.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
do
you
have
a
bifurcated
system
where
the
penalty
hearing
is
separate
from
the
trial?
justice
stevens
and,
if...
if
you
had
such
a
hearing...
i
take
it
you
have
the
same
jury
though
that
hears
both.
justice
stevens
if
you
had
a
different
trier
of
the
fact
in
the
sentencing
hearing
here,
would
the
evidence...
there
is
some
very
bad
evidence
in
this
case,
this
is
obviously
a
very
mean
person...
and
had
no
remorse,
and
that
tape
recorder
thing
really
makes
him
to
be
a
pretty
bad
person.
none
of
that
would
have
been
admissible
in
the
sentencing
hearing,
would
it,
because
that
is
all
irrelevant
because
the
death
really
was...
was
required
as
soon
as
they
proved
the
$13
robbery?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
and
no
mitigating
circumstance.
justice
stevens
say
there
is
no...
everybody
agrees
there
is
no
mitigating
circumstance
here.
therefore,
all
the
other
evidence
about
the
real
aggravation,
the
stuff
that
makes
many
objective
people
think
this
man
may
well
deserve
the
death
penalty,
that
all
would
have
been
irrelevant,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
and
it
was
all
put
before
the
jury.
justice
stevens
and
i
take
it,
if
it
had
been
a
sentencing
hearing
as
opposed
to
a
trial...
i
suppose
it
all
went
to
intent,
and
i
am
not
suggesting
it
was
improperly
received,
but
if
you'd
had
a
test
to...
you
know,
a
separate
hearing
on
penalty
only,
that
evidence
would
have
been
irrelevant,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stevens
there
was
part
of
your
brief
on
this
subject...
part
of
your
brief
on
this
subject
puzzled
me
a
little
bit.
it
seemed
to
me
at
one
time
you
were
arguing
that
an
aggravating
circumstance
can
be
some
of
them
are
not
quite
as
serious
as
others,
and
that
a
minorly
aggregating
is
really
mitigating.
could
the
juror
in
this
case
have
said
that
well,
he
only
stole
$13,
so
that's
mitigating?
justice
stevens
so,
in
your
view,
a
given
circumstance
can
be
both
aggravating
and
mitigating
at
the
same
time.
justice
stevens
even
taking
out
those
words,
in
one
of
your
circumstances,
as
i
remember
it,
is
prior
conviction
of
voluntary
manslaughter.
that
mandates
the
death
penalty,
but
could
you
say
that
the
defendant
could
say
well,
that's
really
mitigating
because
they
didn't
intentionally
kill,
or
he,
it
wasn't
deliberate,
or
whatever
the
formula
is
to
distinguish
manslaughter
from
murder?
justice
stevens
so
something
the
legislature
has
determined
to
be
an
aggravating
circumstance
that
mandates
the
death
penalty
then
can
be
considered
by
the
jury
to
be
mitigating.
justice
stevens
in
the
absence
of
mitigating
circumstances.
justice
stevens
mr.
attorney,
i
can't
resist
saying
i
think
the
state
is
to
be
commended
for
not
carrying
out
executions
until
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
has
been
determined
in
the
first
case.
