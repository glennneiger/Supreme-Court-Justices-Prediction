mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
thank
you,
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
does
the
mandatory
language
in
the
pennsylvania
death
sentence...
death
penalty
statute,
prevent
a
sentencer
from
making
an
independent
determination
as
to
whether
death's
a
appropriate
sentence
in
a
given
case.
in
california
v.
ramos,
in
a
majority
opinion
written
by
justice
connor,
she
approved
a
far-reaching
inquiry
into
the
countless
facts
and
circumstances
by
a
sentencing
jury,
and
she
indicated
in
that
opinion
that
once
an
individual
defendant
becomes
death
eligible,
then
the
jury
can
take
into
consideration
a
myriad
of
facts
and
circumstances
which
might
warrant
a
sentence
of
less
than
death.
in
pennsylvania,
the
pennsylvania
legislature
has
unconstitutionally,
in
my
opinion,
limited
the
types
of
mitigation
that
a
jury
can
consider
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
mitigation.
for
instance,
pennsylvania
only
allows
a
jury
to
consider
extreme
mental
illness
or
substantial
impairment.
but
in
this
particular
case,
mr.
blystone
gave
an
extended
confession
to
a
police
informant,
and
in
that
confession
he
alluded
to
things
like,
well,
it
was
thrilling
to
kill
somebody,
and
you
really
don't
have
to
be
a
bad
person
to
kill,
and
alluded
to
aspects
of
the
person's
brain
coming
out
of
his
head.
now,
a
juror
who
heard
all
this
might
think
that
this
individual
is
mentally
ill
to
think
like
that,
to
have
no
regard
at
all
for
life,
but
might
feel
that
under
the
definition
of
pennsylvania's
extreme
mental
illness,
or
substantial
impairment,
it
wouldn't
qualify,
because
he
might
feel
extreme
would
be
locked
up
in
a
mental
institution
or
taking
thorazine.
and
what
happens
is
that
he
is
not
allowed
to
consider
mental
illness
or
substantial
impairment
in
making
a
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
death
is
the
appropriate
sentence.
the
respondent
had
suggested
that
in
the
catchall,
number
8,
the
jury
could
then
consider
whether
or
not
an
individual
is
simply
mentally
impaired
or
simply
mentally
ill.
but
i
think
that...
that
analysis
is
incorrect
for
this
reason.
when
the
pennsylvania
legislature
wrote
this
statute,
they
included
a
burden
of
proof,
proof
beyond
a...
proof
beyond
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
there
is
a
mitigating
factor.
so
if
the...
the
statute
required
proof
beyond
a
preponderance
of
evidence
that
it--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--proof
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
thank
you.
proof
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
an
individual
was
severely
mentally
ill
or
extremely
mentally
ill.
if
it
could
be
picked
up
in
this
catchall,
then
that
would
destroy
the
burden
of
proof,
because
the
jury
would
no
longer
have
to
find
it
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
in
addition,
the
language
of
the
statute
is
any
other
factor,
and
a
fair
reading
of
the
word
other
would
probably
mean
other
than
the
first
seven
factors.
so,
a
defendant
in
pennsylvania
would
probably
be
left...
a
defendant
in
pennsylvania
who
is
just
simply
mentally
ill,
or
whose
judgment
was
just
substantially
impaired,
would
be
left
with
a
situation
where
the
jury
could
not
consider
that,
or
give
any
weight
to
it,
in
making
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
death
is
the
appropriate--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--it
does.
but
what
i
was
suggesting
to
the
court
is
this.
before
that
catchall,
it
has
a...
a
specific
mitigating
circumstance
of
extreme
mental
illness
or
a
substantial
impairment.
now,
if
a
jury,
in
viewing
all
the
evidence,
goes
down
the
list
and
determines
that
he
wasn't
extremely
mentally
ill,
or
severely
emotionally
impaired,
he
would
set
that
aside,
or
she
would
set
that
aside,
and
go
on
down
the
list
to
see
if
it
fit
in
any
other
category.
and
i
would
suggest
to
justice
o'connor
that
when
they
got
down
to
the
catchall,
and
it
says
any
other
evidence,
a
juror
who
was
instructed
probably
wouldn't
retrieve
it
back
and
conclude--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--well,
it
is
for
a
jury
to
give
whatever
weight
they
consider
to
any
particular
factor,
and
it
could
well
be
that
amongst
the
12
they
might
consider
something
that
would
be
mitigating
which
an
attorney
wouldn't
have
brought
up.
in
this
particular
case,
the
closing...
there
was
no
mitigation
presented
by
mr.
blystone.
the
closing
argument
by
his
counsel
probably
was
a
minute
and
a
half
to
two
minutes,
because
that
was
reflected
upon
one
page
of
the
transcript.
and
the
basic
plea
was
don't
execute
him.
there
was
no
argument
vis
a
vis
mitigation.
and,
as
i
also
have
suggested,
i
think
a
juror
who
was
told
that
there
was
a
certain
burden
of
proof
that
had
to
be
met
wouldn't
go
back,
after
he
couldn't
meet
that
burden,
to
just
apply
it
like
that.
all
the
cases
that
the
court
has
talked
about
in
terms
of
lockett,
eddings,
jurek,
they
all
suggested
that
a
juror
should
be
allowed
to
weigh
whatever
is
mitigating
and
give
whatever
weight
he
feels
it
should
have
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
that--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--well--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--it
does--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
but
the
argument
suggests
that
because
of
the
limiting
nature
or
the
limitations
that
pennsylvania
puts
on
the
mitigating
circumstances,
that's
the
reason
why
there
were
no
mitigating
circumstances
in
this
particular--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--okay,
well
then,
let
me
just
go
right
to
that,
then.
in
pennsylvania
the
situation
is
that
if
there
is
one
aggravating
and
no
mitigating
circumstances,
then
the
jury
is
instructed
that
they
must
return
with
the
verdict
of
death.
in
that
particular
case
there
is
no
weighing,
as
had
just
been
suggested
in
the
last
argument,
in
north
carolina,
as
to
the
strength
of
the
aggravating
circumstance.
i
think,
in
an
opinion
that
you
co-authored
in
barclay,
you
had
suggested
that
if
the
aggravating
circumstances
outweighed
the
mitigating,
but
weren't
so
weighty
as
to
require
death,
then
the
jury
should
be
permitted
to
return
with
the
verdict
of
life,
because
it
wouldn't
have
been
the
appropriate
sentence.
also,
in
north
carolina
v.
smith,
you
had
suggested
again
that
there
is
almost
a
constitutional
right
for
a
jury
to
exercise
its
discretion
and
return
with
a
verdict
of
life,
even
though
there
might
be
more
aggravating
than
mitigating,
when
the
strength
of
the
aggravating
is
not
such
that
would
require
the
death
sentence.
in
pennsylvania,
what
happens
is
that
if
there
are
no
mitigating
circumstances,
the
jury
is
instructed
that
they
must
return
with
the
verdict
of
death.
they
have
absolutely
no
discretion
at
all.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
this
falls
under
the
same
problem
as
caldwell
v.
mississippi.
in
that
case
the
jury
was
told
that
it's
really
not
ultimately
up
to
you
to
decide
whether
the
person
is
going
to
die.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
has
an
overview
of
that.
in
pennsylvania,
what
they
tell
the
jurors
are
that
you
really
have
no
choice,
or
you
have
no
discretion.
the
verdict
is
mandatory;
you
must
return
with
the
verdict
of
death.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
well,
only
to
suggest
that
in
caldwell
this
court
spoke
about
the...
the
awesome
responsibility
it...
is
upon
a
jury
when
they
decide
whether
or
not
to
take
somebody's
life.
and
the
fact
that
that
responsibility
is
somewhat
delegated
by
suggesting
that
it...
the...
that
the
supreme
court
could
review
that.
in
this
particular
case,
the
analogy
would
be
that
some
of
the
responsibility
for
the
jury,
in
deciding
whether
somebody
should
live
or
die,
is
being
taken
away
from
them
when
they
are
told
that
it's
really
not
up
to
you.
once
you
find
an
aggravating
circumstance,
then
you
must
return
with
the
verdict
of
death.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
i
do.
i
think
that
the
eighth
amendment
would
suggest
that
there
is
a
certain
reliability
necessary
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
death
is
an
appropriate
sentence.
in
pennsylvania--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--well,
reliability
in
the...
in
the
respect
that
a
jury
really
doesn't
get
to
consider
whether
there
is
an...
just
because
there
is
an
aggravating
circumstance,
that
death
is
an
appropriate
sentence.
it
is
not
a
situation
like
had
been
suggested
in
the
north
carolina
legislature,
where
even
though
mitigating
circumstance...
excuse
me,
even
though
aggravating
circumstances
are
found
and
no
mitigating
circumstances
are
found,
the
jury
still
makes
an
independent
determination
as
to
whether
the
strength
of
that
aggravation
is
enough
to
warrant
a
sentence
of
death.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
well,
i
would
only
like
to
suggest,
and
what
i
was
trying
to
suggest
to
justice
stevens,
is
simply
this.
it
is
our
position
also
that
pennsylvania
limits
the
types
of
mitigation
that
can
be
considered--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--well,
only
in
the
respect
that
you
had
suggested
to
me
pennsylvania
had
already
found
that
there
was
no...
there
was
no
mitigation.
but
i
am
suggesting
the
reason
that
they
found
that
there
was
no
mitigation
is
because
they
were
limited
by
the
statute
in
finding
that
mitigation
to
engage
in
a
weighing
process.
in
pennsylvania
there
is
no
weighing
process
at
all.
it
could
be
the
most
minimal
of
felony
murders,
and
a
defendant
would
be
sentenced
to
death
if
the
jury
didn't
find
any
aggravating
circumstances
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--if
they
didn't
find
any
mitigating
circumstances
that
outweighed
aggravating
circumstances,
the
verdict
would
have
to
be
death.
or
if
they
found
no
mitigating
circumstances
at
all,
then
the
verdict
would
have
to
be
death.
and
i
think
that
it
goes
also
in
line
with
what
justice
blackmun
was
saying
about
the
dangers
of
having
a
mandatory
sentence.
the
dangers
of
having
a
mandatory
sentence
are
that
you
can't
judge
or
evaluate
the
strength
of
a
mitigating
circumstance.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
i
think
it
is
constitutionally
required
that
the
jury
can
weigh
an
aggravating
circumstance
to
make
a
determination--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--i
think
the
constitution
would
require
that
the
jury
could
look
to
that
single
circumstance
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
that
was
strong
enough,
or
the
facts
that
went
into
killing
the
police
officer
were
such--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--okay.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
yes.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
well,
i
would
only
suggest,
justice
kennedy,
that
different
legislatures
around
the
country
have
addressed
that
very
issue.
obviously,
north
carolina
has,
florida
has,
arkansas
has,
nebraska
has,
and
they
all
suggest
that
even
when
an
aggravating
circumstance
is
found,
that
the
jury
should
still
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
that
aggravating
circumstance
is
substantial
enough
to
warrant
death.
i
had
suggested,
when
i...
when
i
was
addressing
justice
stevens,
that
he
had
also
suggested
in
certain
cases
that
even
though
you
find
an
aggravating
circumstance,
and
he
didn't
identify
that
as
either
killing
a
police
officer
or
any
other
of
the
enumerated
circumstances,
but
he
did
suggest
that
there
are
cases
where
you
do
have
aggravating
circumstances
and
no
mitigating
circumstances,
but
the
aggravating
circumstances
in
and
of
themselves
aren't
so
weighty,
or
aren't
so
substantial
that
would
require
death
sentencing.
if
you
do
have--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--and
because
of
the
aggravating
circumstance
and
the
facts
that
surround
the
aggravating
circumstance.
because,
in
the
opinion
that
he
authored,
there
was
no
evidence
necessarily
as
to
what
the
facts
were
of
the
aggravating
circumstances.
all
i
am
suggesting
is...
what
was
suggested
in
that
opinion,
is
you
can
have
a
situation
where
you
do
have
an
aggravating
circumstance,
you
don't
have
any...
excuse
me,
you
don't
have
any
mitigating
circumstances,
but
the
jury
makes
an
independent
determination
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
wasn't
substantial
enough
to
warrant
the
death
sentence.
and
that
is
the
only
thing
i
was
suggesting
by
that
answer.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
felony
murder.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
it
was
a
felony
murder.
the
aggravating
circumstance
was
a
felony
murder.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
the
robbery.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
murder...
first
degree
murder
in
the
course
of
committing
a
felony.
when
they
found
mr.
blystone
guilty
of
the
crime
they
in
effect
had
already
proven
aggravating
circumstances.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
prosecutor
closed
to
the
jury
in
his...
in
the
sentencing
phase,
he
had
indicated
to
them
that
we
have
already
established
that
a
felony
murder
has
been
committed,
and
then
he
spoke
about
their
duty
to
return
a
verdict
of
death.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
no,
i
think
that
if
he
was
found
guilty
of...
well,
maybe
under
enmund
he
couldn't,
but
in
pennsylvania...
if
he
had
been
found
guilty
of
first
degree
murder,
as
an
accomplice--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--well,
he
could
have
as
a
co-conspirator,
as
a...
in
other
words,
because
he
didn't
actually
take
the
money--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--no,
probably
not.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
correct.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
right,
to
the
penalty
determination,
that's
correct.
i
only
suggest
that
the
courts
have
indicated
that
there
is
a
constitutional
requirement
that
before
a
sentence
of
death
may
be
imposed,
it
is
the
sentencer
that
must
decide
whether
death
is
an
appropriate
sentence.
in
this
particular
case
the
sentencer
is
precluded
from
making
the
determination
that
death
is
an
appropriate
sentence
in
this
case.
once
the
aggravating
circumstance
is
found
and
no
mitigation
is
found,
then
he
has
no
say
in
it.
it
is
a
type
of
mechanical,
rigid
process
that
the
court
suggested
was
inappropriate.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
but
the...
but...
justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--well,
what
i
would
like
to
suggest
is
that
in
the
furman
case
the
reason
that
they
spoke
about
unbridled
discretion,
it
was
because
of
the
broad
spectrum
of
people
who
were
death
eligible.
and
i
think
when
they
spoke
about
unbridled
discretion
or
that
kind
of
discretion
which
you
had
suggested
to
me,
it
dealt
with
situations
where
the
pool
of
death-eligible
people
was
too
broad,
and
it
was--
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
--but
the
problem
with
that
is
that
that
conflicts
with
the
eighth
amendment
requirement
that
a
jury
should
make
a
determination
that,
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case,
it's...
this
is
the
appropriate
decision.
and
in
pennsylvania
there
is
no
way
to
do
that,
and
there
is
no
way
to
in
any
way
measure
the
degree
or
the
strength
of
the
aggravating
circumstance
that
would
justify
the
imposition
of
death.
i
understand
what
you're
saying
as
it
relates
to
the
unbridled
discretion.
i
would
only
suggest
to
you
that
this
court
has
held
in...
in
various
of
these...
in
various
cases,
that
in
considering
mitigation,
for
instance,
the
jury
could
have
unbridled
discretion.
mr....
justice
stevens
had
suggested
that
also
that.
i
think
you
have
to
make
a
distinction
between
the
two.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
i
know
that.
so,
with
permission
of
the
court
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
r.
gettleman
my
rebuttal
will
be
very
brief,
judge...
mr.
chief
justice,
and
it
would
only
be
in
response
to
just
a
couple
of
points
that
the
respondent
made.
the
respondent
seems
to
suggest
that
it
is
all
right
for
the
jury
to
weigh
the
strength
of
the
aggravation,
but
the
way
it
is
done
is
it
comes
in
through
the
catchall
mitigating
situation.
in
this
particular
case,
before
the
trial
judge
charged
the
jury,
he
said
to
them
that
he
was
going
to
list
everything
that
they
could
consider
as
mitigation.
and
then
he
went
down
the
list
and
he
suggested
all
the
factors,
the
seven
specific
factors
and
the
one
catchall
factor.
but
a
jury
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
that
if
they
found
a
specific
aggravating
circumstance,
a
felony
murder
by
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
that
they
could
then
turn
around
and
weigh
that
as
a
mitigating
circumstance
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
under
the
mitigation.
there
is
no
instruction
whatsoever,
and
there
is
no
way
a
jury
could
even
have
intuitively
known
that
it
was
permissible
for
them
to
flip-flop
on
a
particular
aggravating
circumstance,
turn
it
into
a
mitigating
circumstance,
create
a
straw
man
and
weigh
the
two
against
each
other,
and
then
come
up
with
a...
a
determination
as...
as
to
whether
an
aggravating
circumstance
outweighed
itself,
or
whether
a
mitigating
circumstance
outweighed
itself.
another
thing
that
the
commonwealth
had,
or
the
respondent
had
suggested,
that
it's
all
right
for
a
jury
in
pennsylvania
to
consider
just
mental
illness
or
substantial
impairment,
that
that
can
be
considered
under
the
catchall
phrase.
but,
in
a
similar
vein
as
california
v.
brown,
when
the
court
spoke
about
mere
sympathy,
well,
you
can't
take
out
that
word
mere,
and
in
pennsylvania
you
can't
take
out
the
word
other,
as
in
other
factors.
and
other
factors
would
be
other
than
the
first
seven.
and
if
a
jury
who
was
going
to
listen
to
its
instructions
felt
that
the...
the
severity
of
the
illness
wasn't
extreme
or
wasn't
substantial,
then
they
would
be
precluded
from
what
this
court
has
suggested
that
they
have
every
right
to
do,
in
lockett
and
jurek
and
those
other
cases,
is
to
consider
any
mitigating
evidence
and
give
it
the
weight
that
it
believes
it
deserves
in
arriving
at
the
formula
as
to
whether
one
outweighs
the
other.
and
in
conclusion,
i
think
this
court
has
alluded
to,
and
has
specifically
said
through
justice
stevens,
that
there
is
a
constitutional
right
to
have
the
defendant...
have
the
jury
weigh
the
weight
or
the
strength
of
the
aggravating
circumstance,
even
if
it
is
weighed
against
itself,
to
make
a
determination
that
that's
the
type
and
the
strength
of
the
kind
of
circumstance
that
would
justify
a
death
sentence
as
opposed
to
a
lesser
included
sentence.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
have
none.
