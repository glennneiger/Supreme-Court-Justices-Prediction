chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-6222,
scott
wayne
blystone
against
pennsylvania.
mr.
gettleman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
caldwell
was
at
least
in
part
based
on
the
idea
that
the...
there
were...
wrong
statements
of
law,
misleading
statements
of
law
made
to
the
jury
about
their
responsibility.
here,
it
seems
to
me,
that
when
the
judge
says
the
jury...
tells
the
jury
you
don't
have
any
choice,
they
don't
have
any
choice.
you
say
that
is
wrong,
but
i
don't
think
it
makes
it
a
caldwell
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
your...
your
argument
then
is
that...
that...
the
jury
must
always
be
permitted,
no
matter
what
sort
of
facts
it
finds,
to
find
in
its
discretion,
whether
it's
life
or
death.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
has
this
got
to
do
with
reliability?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but...
but
i...
i
know
pennsylvania
is
different
from
north
carolina.
but
here
the
jury
has
considered
all
the
mitigating
evidence,
i
guess
by
hypothesis,
and
found
that
no
mitigating
circumstance
exists.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
really
isn't
your
question
presented,
is
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gettleman.
mr.
preate,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
would
the
verdict
have
said,
mr.
preate,
if
one
juror
had
found
mitigating
circumstances
and
11
had
not?
would...
would
the
verdict
have...
have
read
differently
than
the
verdict
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay,
we
know
that,
but
let's--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--aggravating
or
mitigating?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
asked
you
about
the
mitigating.
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
one
juror
found
one
mitigating,
and
the
other
11
didn't.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
would
the
verdict
read
as
to
that
aspect?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
preate.
mr.
gettleman,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
nine
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gettleman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
second
case
is
blystone
against
pennsylvania,
and
the
petitioner
in
this
case
was
convicted
of
robbery
and
first
degree
murder
by
a
pennsylvania
jury
and
sentenced
to
death.
the
pennsylvania
death
penalty
statute
provides
that
in
such
cases
a
sentence
of
death
must
be
imposed
if
a
jury
unanimously
finds
at
least
one
aggravating
circumstance
and
no
mitigating
circumstances.
the
jury
in
this
case
found
one
aggravating
factor,
that
the
killing
was
committed
during
the
course
of
a
felony,
but
found
no
mitigating
factors.
it
accordingly
sentenced
the
petitioner
to
death.
on
appeal
to
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
this
conviction
and
sentence
was
upheld.
we
granted
certiorari.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
hold
that
the
pennsylvania
death
penalty
statute
in
petitionerâ€™s
sentence
under
it
is
consistent
with
our
decisions
in
interpreting
the
eight
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
we
have
previously
decided
that
state
laws
which
impose
the
death
penalty
solely
because
of
a
particular
crime
committed,
for
example,
murder
committed
by
an
inmate
serving
a
life
sentence
are
invalid
because
they
do
not
allow
for
any
consideration
of
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
offense
or
of
the
defendant.
petitioner
claims
that
the
pennsylvania
statute
is
similarly
mandatory
in
character
because
if
the
jury
finds
aggravating
circumstances
but
no
mitigating
circumstances,
it
must
impose
the
death
penalty.
we
reject
this
contention.
pennsylvania
allows
the
jury
to
consider
both
aggravating
circumstances
and
mitigating
circumstances
regarding
the
nature
of
the
offense
in
the
character
of
the
defendant.
the
eight
amendment
imposes
no
further
requirement
that
the
jury
be
left
totally
free
to
find
in
favor
of
a
life
sentence
even
though
it
found
aggravating
circumstances
but
no
mitigating
ones.
so,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
has
joined
and
in
which
justice
blackmun
and
justice
stevens
have
joined
except
for
part
4.
