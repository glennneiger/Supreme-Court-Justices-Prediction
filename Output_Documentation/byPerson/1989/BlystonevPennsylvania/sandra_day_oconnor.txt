justice
o'connor
proof
beyond
a
preponderance
or
proof
by
a
preponderance?
justice
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
thought
the
pennsylvania
law
allowed
full
consideration
of
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
justice
o'connor
don't
you
think
that
an
attorney
would
argue
on
the
basis
of
all
of
the
mitigating
evidence
that
came
in,
including
whatever
degree
of
mental
impairment
there
might
be?
