mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
pennsylvania's
death
penalty
statute
is
not
a
mandatorily
unconstitutional
statute.
it
is
a
constitutional
guided
discretion
statute.
it
allows
the
jury
to
consider
all
relevant
mitigating
evidence
in
making
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
statute
that
this
court
addressed
in
woodson
and
roberts,
and
in
sumner
v.
shuman,
where--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--the
evil,
justice
white,
in
those
cases,
was
that
the
jury
never
got
to
make
the
individualized
determination
that
they're
required
by
the
statute
to
make.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
it
was
simple
finding--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--well,
they...
they...
the
statute
in
woodson--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--well,
there
are
two
thresholds
that
the
pennsylvania
statute
requires
the
jury
to
cross
before
it
finds
that
this
is
a
death
penalty
case.
the
first
threshold
is,
of
course,
given,
is
a
first
degree
murder.
and
the
second
threshold
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
valid
aggravating
circumstance
which
must
be
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
unanimously
by
the
jury,
and
then
it
must
go
further.
the
inquiry
does
not
stop,
in
pennsylvania
statute,
by
simply
finding
that
the
aggravating
factor
exists,
and
that's
perhaps
the
evil
of...
of
some
of
the
cases
that
we
had
heard
from...
had
seen
before.
in
pennsylvania
the
jury
must
then
consider,
they
are
forced
to
consider
whether
or
not
there
are
any
mitigating
circumstances
in
the
record.
and
if
there
are
none,
then
they
are,
of
course,
obligated
at
that
point,
constitutionally,
i
believe,
to
come
in
with
a
death
penalty.
it
is
appropriate
that,
at
that
particular
stage,
the
post-consideration
stage,
that
the
statute
takes
its
effect.
the
mandatory
feature
does
not
take
effect
in
the
beginning;
it
takes
effect
at
the
end
of
the
reasoning
process,
so
that
the
result
is
a
rational,
reasoned,
moral
response,
rather
than--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--yes,
justice
stevens,
we
do.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
yes,
yes,
we
do.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
there
was,
there
are
two
things
that
are...
three
things
that
are
required
under
the
valid
aggravating
circumstance--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--it
requires
a
murder.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
it
requires
a
robbery--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--and
then
in
this,
the
jury
must--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--well,
that
this--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--well,
it
would
not
be
considered.
it
could
not
be
considered
because
under
pennsylvania
statute
the
only
thing
that
the
jury
can
consider
in...
as
an
aggravating
factor,
is
that
exclusive
list.
certainly
there
was
a
lot
of
aggravation
there,
but
they
could
not
consider
that.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
it
was
put
before
the
jury,
your
honor.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
but
the
statute--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--that's
correct.
it
would
have
been
irrelevant.
but
the
point
of
the
matter
is...
that,
by
having
the
jury
consider
only
the
factors
of
first
degree
murder
and
robbery,
and
then
they
have
to
add
the
third
element
of
whether
that...
that
murder
occurred
in
the
perpetration
of
the
robbery,
that's
not
a...
that's
a
step
that
had
to
be
taken
by
this
jury.
and
that's
not
a
step
that
should
be
treated
lightly.
so,
in
this
particular
case,
the...
the
function
of
aggravating
is
to
narrow
the
class
of
death
eligibles.
and
that...
that's...
that's
good
facet
of
pennsylvania's
statute,
because
it
helps
to
reduce
arbitrariness.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
it...
it...
justice
kennedy,
that
is
correct.
at
that
particular
time
the
prosecutor
could
argue
to
the
jury
that...
that
this
was
the
product
of
a
mind
that
was
not
extremely
emotionally
disturbed,
that...
that
there
was
some
relevance
to
that
in
rebuttal
to...
to
an
argument
that
might
have
been
proposed.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
the
state
would
show
no
mitigating...
you
mean
aggravating?
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
it
does
not.
the
only...
the
only
thing
relevant
that
the
state
can
establish
is
whether
or
not
the
facts
establish
a
valid
aggravating
circumstance.
and
the
jury
then
makes
that
determination
whether
they
have
been
established.
and
the
jury
can,
and
in...
in
numbers
of
cases,
say
no
that
they
haven't
been
established.
it
is...
it
is
then
up
to
the
defendant
to
proffer
evidence
of
mitigation.
the
jury
must
consider
it;
it
is
not
precluded
by
this
statute
from
considering
it,
and
is
not
precluded
from
giving
effect
to
that
evidence
under
the
pennsylvania
statute.
it
can
do
that
through
the
various
eight
categories
that
are
listed
as
part
of
the
pennsylvania
statute,
in
which
mitigation...
mitigating
factors
are
spelled
out.
and
this
jury
in
particular
was
told
what
mitigation
was.
it
said
that
something
less
severe...
and
these
seven
factors,
specific
factors,
and
the
eight
catchall,
(e)(8),
give
content
to
just
what
mitigating
is
under
the
pennsylvania
statute.
it
gives
the
kind
of
guidance
to
a
jury
that
a
state
ought
to
give
in
helping
its
citizens
reach
such
a
momentous
verdict.
so
that
that
verdict
is
the
product
of...
of
rationality
and
reason,
rather
than
emotion
and
unguided
discretion,
so
that
go...
we
don't
go
back
to
the...
to
the
arbitrariness
of
furman.
this
is
precisely
why
pennsylvania's
statute
is
in
the
center
of
all...
of
the
spectrum
of...
of...
of
statutes
that
cover
the
landscape
in
the
united
states.
we're
not
in
the
extreme
of
unbridled
discretion,
as
some
of
the
statutes
may
be,
or
close
to
that.
nor
we
are...
nor
are
we
in
the
other
extreme,
where
a
statute
requires
the
finding
of
death
on
the
simple
finding
of
first
degree
capital
murder
without
any
consideration
of
mitigating.
this
statute
provides
a
fair
balance
of...
of
the
competing
interests
that
are
involved
here,
of
arbitrariness,
and
it
encourages
individualized
sentencing,
and
it...
and
it...
it
makes
the...
jury's
verdict
one
of
appropriateness
and
rationality.
and
when
their
final
verdict
is
in,
it's
the
kind
of
case
in
which
speaks
clearly
that
this
is...
this
defendant
deserves
the
death
penalty
because
of
the
aggravating
factors
here.
they
are
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
there
are
no
mitigating
factors,
or
the
aggravating
outweighed
the
mitigating
factors
that
had
been
established.
i...
i
would...
i
would
point
out
that
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
pennsylvania
statute
is
mandatory,
and
the
defendant
again
seems
to
walk
away
from
it,
even
here
at
oral
argument.
and...
and
i
would
suggest
to
the...
to
this
court,
that
the...
that
his
argument
on
whether
or
not
there
is
a
sufficiency
of
weighing
of
the
aggravating,
or...
that
there
is
insufficient
consideration
of
degrees
of
mitigating,
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
statute
is
mandatory.
if
you
took
the
"must"
word
out
of
the
there,
the
word
that
says
that
the
defendant...
that
the
jury
must
find
the...
the...
the
defendant
guilty...
excuse
me,
must
impose
the
death
penalty
after
aggravating
are
found
and
no
mitigating,
or
aggravating
outweigh
mitigating,
if
you
took
that
word
and
put
"may"
in
there,
it...
the
problem
would
still
be
there,
because
it
is
a
lockett
problem,
it's
an
eddings
problem.
it's
not...
it's
not
a
mandatory
sentence...
it's
not
a
mandatory
statute
under
those
circumstances.
so,
we
have,
we...
we
really
have
to
focus
here.
i
think,
on...
on...
on
what
the
question
is
that
has
been
asked
by
this
court.
and
this
statute
is
not
mandatory
because
it
permits
the
jury
to
consider
all
relevant
evidence
in
making
a
decision.
mitigating,
as
mitigating
factors,
just
as
this
court
has
required,
pennsylvania
has
spelled
them
out.
this
statute
came
into
being
in
1978
after
lockett.
those
factors
are...
are...
are
there
because
this
court
has
indicated
to
the
states
that...
that
juries
need
to
be
guided.
we
have
taken
the
advice
of
this
court
and
the
states
have
decided
that
this
is
the
way
that
they
have
gone.
there
are
14
states
that
have
similar
statutes
like
pennsylvania's.
they
have
structured
the
mitigating
to
give
it
content.
they
have...
they
added
factors
in
there
that
permit
mitigation
to
be
considered.
in
relation
to
the...
the
argument
that
the
defendant
makes
that...
that
they
ought,
we
ought
to
weigh
the
sufficiency
of
the
aggravating,
i'll
address
that
even
though
it's...
i
don't
think
it
is
relevant
to
the
question.
because
there
is
no...
no
case
of
this
court,
neither
does
the
constitution
require
that
we
weigh
the
sufficiency
of
aggravating.
for
example,
your
jurek
case,
this
court
did
not
have
a...
a
weighing
process
approved
there.
there
was
none
under
the
texas
statute.
but...
but
the
point
to
be
made
here
is
that
pennsylvania
allows
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
and
that's
all
this
court
requires,
and
that
the
constitution
requires
is.
and
the
real
question
here
is,
does
the
jury
get
to
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
that
is
what
the
question
is
here.
and
in
pennsylvania
statute,
they
are
required
to
look
at
the
circumstances
of
the
offense
as
a
mitigating
factor,
just
as
this
court
has
said
in
lockett.
and
it
lists
them,
all
of
them,
that...
that
the
major,
as
this
court
has
called
them,
the...
the
major
categories
of
mitigating
evidence,
and
then...
then
it
provides
an
(e)(8)
that
the
jury
can
consider,
and
this
is
what
the
judge
in
this
case
termed
it,
a
catchall,
that
any
other
evidence
of
mitigation
concerning
the
character
and
the
record
of
the
defendant,
and
the
circumstances
of
the
offense,
are
considered
in
mitigation.
and
that--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
differ
from
north
carolina
in
that
respect.
and
importantly,
our
court
has
interpreted
our
statute
as
not
requiring
a
unanimity
of
finding
of
mitigation.
one
juror
finding
mitigation,
under
pennsylvania
law,
causes
all
jurors
to
consider
all
of
those
factors--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--and
the
verdict
must
be
unanimous.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
that
is
correct.
and
the
statute...
the
statute
gives
the
jury
the
option
to
do
that,
properly
so.
there
may
not
be
mitigating
in
a
case.
that...
that
there
are
cases
in
which
there
are
no
mitigating
factors.
the
defendant
seems
to
want
the
statute
to
say
here
is
the
evidence,
and
you
must
now
find
it,
as
if
the
statute
should
do
all
the
work
for
him.
he
ignores
the
fact--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--mr.
chief
justice,
it
certainly
would.
it
would
have
read,
we
the
jury
find,
aggravating
factor,
and
they
would,
must
list
the
aggravating
factor,
they
just,
it
is
not...
so
there
is
review
by
the
[inaudible]
court.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
it
would
have
to
list
the
aggravating
and
spell
it
out
what
they
found.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
if
they
found
one
mitigating--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
the
verdict
would
read
the
aggravating
outweighed
the
mitigating,
or
the
mitigating
outweighed
the
aggravating.
that
is
what
the
verdict
slip
would
read.
we
are
different,
therefore,
from
north
carolina.
that
one
juror,
the
concern
that
you
had,
justice
stevens,
would
be
able
to
give
effect
to
his
concern
of
the
youth.
he
might
think
that
the
youth
of
that...
that
defendant
was
mitigating,
he
would
be
able
to
give
it
effect,
he
would
be
able
to
vote
for
the...
the
finding...
the
finding
of
youth
as
a
mitigating
factor.
and
if
he
did
not
find
that
the
aggravating
outweighed--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--certainly,
because
the...
he
could
have...
he
could
have...
could
have
given
effect
to
that
evidence
under,
for
example,
(e)(7),
the
defendant's
participation
in
the
act
was
relatively
minor.
or,
without
a
label,
without
a
label,
under
(e)(8),
where
the
statute
reads
any
other
evidence
of
mitigation
concerning
the
character
and
record
of
the
defendant
and
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
it...
it
might
be.
it
might
be.
there
is
certainly
part
of
the
same
spectrum.
for
example,
if...
i
refer
the
court
to
mitigating
circumstance
1,
the
defendant
had
no
significant
history
of
prior
convictions,
and
then
on
the
other
side,
an
aggravation,
there
is
number
9,
it
says
the
defendant
has
a
significant
history
of
felony
convictions,
however,
it
is
limited
to
those
involving
the
use
of
threat
or
violence
to
the
person.
so
they
are
the
same
spectrum,
and
that
is,
whether
the
defendant
has
any
record.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
certainly.
under
that...
under
the
pennsylvania--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--certainly
can,
your
honor,
because
he
could
introduce--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--what
i
was
responding
to,
justice
scalia,
was
justice
stevens'
point,
that
the
prior
conviction
of
voluntary
manslaughter
could
be
talked
about
as
a
mitigating
factor
under
the
pennsylvania
statute.
because,
number
one,
for
example,
(e)(8)
says
the
defendant
has
no
significant
history
of
prior
criminal
convictions.
he
could
say
that
is
not
a
significant
history,
and
so
argue
the
point
of
his
prior
conviction.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
well
[inaudible],
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
that
it
mandates
the
death
penalty.
the
jury
must--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--the
jury
can
consider...
consider
whether
or
not
the
aggravating
statute,
the
aggravating
factor
has
been
proven.
the
fact
that
he
had
a
prior
record
of
crimes
of
violence
is
what
the
aggravating
factor
is.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
that
is
possible.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
well,
that
is
possible,
too,
your
honor.
that
construction
is
possible
too.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that...
the
important
consideration
here
is
whether
or
not
this
defendant
could
introduce
and
present
to
the...
to
the
jury
evidence
of
mitigate...
that
would
mitigate,
concerning
his
character,
the
record
that
he
has,
or
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
and
as
long
as
he
is
doing
that,
i
think
that
the
pennsylvania
statute,
the
statute
permits
him
to
do
that,
and
the
statute
permits
him
to
give
it
effect
through
its
broad
categories,
that
that
statute
is
constitutional.
and
it
does
it...
and
it
does
it
precisely
in
the
way
that
this
court
in
lockett
and
eddings
has
said,
and
that
is
as
a
mitigating
factor.
now,
there
may
be
something
in
the
past
that,
or
about
this
crime,
that
is
mitigating,
and...
and
he
would
have
the
opportunity
to
present
it,
even
about
his
prior
record.
he
would
have
the
opportunity
to
present
it
under
this
statute.
he
is
not
precluded
from
doing
that.
this
is
a...
this
is
a
statute
that...
interpret
as
a
catchall,
a
broad
statute,
by
our
supreme
court.
and
i
would
like
to
then
turn
to--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--there
are
110
at
this
particular
time,
justice
blackmun.
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
statute
has
been
before
the
court
for
consideration.
we
appreciate
the
opportunity
here.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
not,
the
last
execution
we
had
was
in
1962.
this
statute
has
been
on
the
books
since
1978.
there
have
been
no
executions
that...
pending
the
outcome
of
this
case.
the
important
fact
that
i
think
also
has
to
be
remembered
here
in
considering
pennsylvania's
statute,
and
petitioner
makes
the
argument
that
the
jury
is
precluded
from
considering
certain
kinds
of
mitigating
evidence
because
the
enumerated
examples
of
mitigation
use
words
like
extreme
and
substantial.
i
suggest
to
this
court,
in
reality,
this
is
no
limitation
for
it.
it
is
the
jury
which
makes
the
determination
what
extreme
is
and
what
substantial
is
in
any
given
situation.
and
since
these
words
alone...
since
the
jury
alone
decides
what
these
words
mean,
they
do
not
restrict
the
jury.
these
words
give
content,
as
i
have
indicated,
to
what
is
meant
by
mitigating
evidence.
and
moreover,
the,
any
evidence
that
does
not
fit
precisely
within
the
category
of
extreme
mental
or
emotional
disturbance,
for
example,
or
that
the
defendant
acted
under
substantial
domination,
any
evidence
that
does
not
fit
in
that
category
is
considered
in
the
catchall
category,
(e)(8),
as
referred
to...
as
other,
as
any
other
evidence
of
mitigation
concerning
the
character,
the
record
of
the
defendant,
the
circumstances
of
his
offense.
i
think
it
is
important
here
to
recognize
again
the
role
of
counsel
in
this
process.
this
is
not
a
superfluous
role,
that
counsel
has
the
opportunity
to
present
evidence
under
pennsylvania's
statute.
he
is
not
precluded
from
doing
that.
he's
not
precluded
from
having
that
evidence
take
effect.
he
doesn't
have
to
put
it
under
the
label
of
extreme
emotional
disturbance,
he
could
have
the
jury
consider
it
in
his...
by
presentation
of
the
argument
under
any
other
evidence,
that
broad
category
of
(e)(8).
and
that's
i
think
what
makes
pennsylvania's
statute
a
solid
statute,
that...
that
well
balances
the
competing
interests
here
that
the
eighth
amendment
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
requires
of
the
states.
the
commonwealth
is,
in
this
particular
case,
has
presented
a
statute
to
this
court
for
consideration
that
we
do
believe
well
balances
those
competing
interests.
it
is...
it
is...
it
fairly
balances
it,
too.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
well,
our...
our
appellate
court
is
required
under
this
statute,
justice
blackmun,
required
in
every
death
penalty
case,
to
conduct
three
specific
reviews.
and
those
reviews
take
considerable
amount
of
time.
and
i
think
it
is
important
that
our
supreme
court
gives
consideration
to
these
cases
so
carefully.
it
requires
the
supreme
court
to
review
the
verdict,
to
determine
whether
it
is
a
verdict
that
is
not
based
on
passion
or
prejudice,
or
some
other
arbitrary
factor.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
there's
those...
there
are
those
who
will
agree
with
that
argument.
however,
i
think
it
is
important,
in
my
duty
as
the
attorney
general
of
the
state,
would
be
to
see
that
the
laws
are
fairly
enforced,
and
to
ensure
that
every
consideration
is
given
to
the
defendant
before
the
power
of
the
state,
the
vast
power
of
the
state,
is...
is
caused
to
take
effect
to
an
execution.
and
so
i
support
our
supreme
court
in
its
careful
review,
and
i
support
the
process
of
appellate
review.
and
i
think
it
is
important,
too,
that
our
supreme
court
looks
at
the
aggravating
circumstance,
it's
forced
to
look
at
the
aggravating
circumstances
written
down
on
the
jury
verdict.
and
it
is
forced
to
see
if
that
aggravating
circumstance
has
validity
in
the
record,
there
is
evidence
to
support
that
finding.
so
that
we
also
have
another
review
on
the
rationality
of
the
jury's
verdict.
and
thirdly,
and
lastly,...
i
am
sorry?
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
this
crime
took
place
in
1983.
the
defendant
was
tried
in
1984.
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
that...
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
finally,
under
pennsylvania's
statute,
a
comparative
proportionality
review
takes
place.
and
i
think
that
the
pennsylvania
statute
has
tried,
the
legislature
has
tried,
given
the
exit...
given
its
sovereignty
under
the
constitution,
to
take
the
kind
of
guidance
that
this
court
over
the
years
has
set...
set
forth
that
should
be
taken.
and
we
have
implemented
in
a
fair
way
the...
the--
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
ernest
d.
preate,
jr.
--thank
you,
your
honor.
thank
you.
