chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
88-840,
golden
state
transit
corporation
v.
the
city
of
los
angeles.
mr.
fasman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
fasman,
are
you
contending
that
merely
because
there
was
a
supremacy
clause
violation
you're
entitled
to
recover
under
section
1983?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so
what...
what
federal
law
was
it
that
protected
this
right
that
you
say
was
denied
to
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
national
labor
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
our...
our
first
opinion
in
golden
state
three
years
ago
decided
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
is
your
response
to
the
argument
of
respondents
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
essentially
creates
rights
in...
in
employees
and
employers
enforceable
against
one
another?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
you're
right,
mr.
fasman,
then
although
you
said
earlier
in
your
argument
that
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause
is
not
enough
to
recover
damages
under
section
1983,
can
you
think
of
any
case
that
would
not
give
you...
where
there
was
preemption
that
would
not
give
you
damages,
any
case
where
the
supremacy
clause
was
violated?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what...
what
would
be
an
example?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
if
the
legislative
history
simply
said
that
we're
preempting
this
area
because
we
don't
want
a
lot
of
conflicting
state
and
local
regulations?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--so
what
happens
when...
when
the
hypothetical
truck
driver
in
justice
stevens'
example
drives
through
the
suburbs
in
violation
of
the,
you
know,
the
ordinance
of
orange
county?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
then
you
have
to
retreat
something
from
your
earlier
statement
that
it's
not
every
preemption
case
that
is
going
to
give
you
damages
under
section
1983.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you're
talking
about
the
special
benefit
test,
is
that
the
cort
v.
ash
test
for
a
private
cause
of
action?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
the...
in
the
city
of
roanoke
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fasman.
mr.
haggerty.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
haggerty.
mr.
fasman,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
fasman,
isn't
this
case
almost
unique
in
<nlra>
[=
nlra]
preemption
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court
in
that
a
municipal
corporation
or
some
governmental
body
was
a
defendant,
as
opposed
to
employer
versus
an
employee?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
even
machinists
preemption,
those
cases
prior
to
this
one
have
almost
always
involved
employee
versus
employer,
haven't
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so...
so
isn't
my
statement
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fasman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-840,
goldent
state
transit
corporation
versus
the
city
of
los
angeles
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
