justice
scalia
--that...
that's
not...
that
goes
a
little
far,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
you...
you...
you
can...
you
can
act
under
color
of
state
law
even
when
a
state
law
does
not
in
fact
contradict
the
federal
law.
you
simply
purport
to
be
acting
under
state
law,
and
in
that
case
the
supremacy
clause
would
not
be
involved.
justice
scalia
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
yeah.
i--
justice
scalia
--furthermore,
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
directly
applicable
to
the
states.
justice
scalia
to
put
it
more
briefly,
your
response
to
that
argument
is
that
we
decided
otherwise
in
golden
state
one.
justice
scalia
specifically
what
we
decided--
justice
scalia
--that
you
had
an
enforceable
right
not
only
against
the...
not
only
against
the
employees
but
also
against
the...
the
state.
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
what
we
held
in
golden
state
one
if
we
didn't
hold
the
opposite
of
that
statement.
justice
scalia
i...
i'm
agreeing
with
you.
i'm
saying
i
don't
know
what
we--
justice
scalia
--i
don't
know
what
we
held
in
golden
state
one
if
we
didn't
hold
that...
that...
that
you
don't
need
an
express
indication
of
congressional
intent
to
create
a
right
against
the
municipality.
justice
scalia
who
would
sue?
how
would
you
ever
get
the
preemption?
if...
if
it's
not
a
right
on
the
part
of
anybody,
who
would
pronounce
the
preemption?
justice
scalia
--i
thought
it
was
the
test
we
applied
to
determine
whether
you
could
get
an
injunction
also.
i
didn't
think
that...
that
anybody
in
the
world
can
sue
to...
to
enforce
federal...
federal
laws.
somebody
who
is
not
proximately
injured,
who
is
not
a
person
who
is
thought
to
be
within...
within
the
scope
of...
of...
of
the...
of
the
benefit
conferred
by
that
law,
can
anybody...
can
sue
to
get
an
injunction?
justice
scalia
i
don't
see
why
i
would
have
a...
a
cause
of
action
for
an
injunction
and
not
have
a
cause
of
action
for
damages
in...
in...
in
any
case.
justice
scalia
the
situations
you've
posited
don't
seem
realistically
to...
to
be
that
to
me.
if
the
law
is...
is
a
law
under
whose
wings
you...
you
come,
you're
entitled
to
an
injunction,
but
you
also
have
a
right
and,
therefore,
entitled
to
damages.
justice
scalia
how...
how
could
we
give
an
injunction
unless
the
individual
has
a
right?
and
1983
requires
the
deprivation
of
a
right
guaranteed
by...
by
federal
law;
correct?
could
we
possibly
give
an
injunction
or
even
a
declaratory
order
in
any
case
unless
the
individual
in
question
had
a
right?
justice
scalia
now,
let's
not
talk
about
preemption.
let's
just
talk
about
right.
doesn't...
doesn't
1983
refer
to
deprivation
of
rights
secured
by
statutes
or
laws
of
the
united
states?
justice
scalia
rights.
now,
is
it
conceivable
that
i
can
get
an
injunction
with
respect
to
a
matter
as
to
which
i
have
no
right?
or
that
i
could
get
a
declaratory
judgment
when
i
do
not
have
a
right?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
in
any
of
those
cases,
if
the
court
had
not
found
1983
rights
it
could,
nevertheless,
have...
have
found
the
ability
to
gain
an
injunction
on
the
part
of
the
individual
against
the...
against
the
grant
agencies?
justice
scalia
do
you
know
any
case
where
we've
drawn
that
distinction,
where
we
say
you
have
a
right?
that
is
to
say,
the
government
can't
behave
in
this
way
towards
you.
you
have
personally
a
right
to
come
into
court
and
to
sue
and
get
an
injunction,
but
you
don't
have
a
right
to
get
damages
under
1983.
do
you
know
any...
any
case
that
would
support
that
proposition:
right
to
an
injunction
but
no
right
to
damages?
justice
scalia
so,
golden
state
one
was
wrong.
i
mean,
that's
a
very
good
argument
for...
for
the
proposition
that
golden
state
one
was
decided
incorrectly.
justice
scalia
we
didn't
find
in
golden
state...
in
golden
state
one
that
the
employer
had
a
right
against
the
state
not
to
be
impeded
in
the
way
the
state
impeded
it?
justice
scalia
we
did
find...
a
right.
justice
scalia
he
does
have
rights
against
a
third
party
to
get
an
injunction?
justice
scalia
based
on
any
analysis,
what
you
just
said
is
not
true,
insofar
as
an
injunction
is
concerned.
he
does
acquire
under
the
statute
a
right
to
get
an
injunction.
it's
clear
enough
that
we'll
give
him
an
injunction,
but
it's
not
clear
enough
that
we'll
give
him
damages.
is...
is...
is
that
the
argument
you're
making?
justice
scalia
before
we'll
give
him
damages,
it
has
to
be
really
clear,
but
if
it's
just
sort
of
clear
we'll
only
give
him
an
injunction.
is...
is
that
the
sort
of
line
you're
asking
us
to
draw
in
1983?
justice
scalia
rights,
not
did
he...
did
it
intend
to
confer
1983
rights.
1983
operates
by
itself.
it's
a
statute
out
there
which
says
if
you
have
a
right,
you
get
damages.
surely
you're
not
arguing
that
each
time
congress
enacts
a
statute,
it
must
affirmatively
say,
moreover,
the
rights
under
this
statute
can
be
sued
on
under
1983.
that's
not
your
position.
justice
scalia
but
we
found
that,
didn't
we,
that
it
does
compel
the
city
here
to
refrain
from
doing
what
it
did?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
so
it
was
not
clear
enough.
it
was
sort
of
clear,
clear
enough
to
get
an
injunction
but
not
really
clear
so
you
can
get
the
damages
action,
is
what
you're
saying?
justice
scalia
mr.
haggerty,
that...
that...
that
has
some...
some
intuitive
appeal,
that
test,
when
one
thinks
of
the
poor
municipality
that
doesn't
know
that
it's
violating
the
federal
law
and...
and,
therefore,
you
shouldn't
give
it...
subject
it
to
damages
unless
it's
clearly
enough
stated.
as
i
say,
that
has
an
intuitive
appeal
up
until
the
point
where
there
is
a
court
decision
that
says,
yes,
cities
cannot
do
this;
employers
do
have
a
right
even
against
the
city
to
continuing
negotiating,
and
the
city
cannot...
impair
that.
at
that
point,
your
argument
does
not
have
any
intuitive
appeal.
why
isn't
it
enough
if...
if...
if...
why
isn't
it
enough
to
say
either
the
statute
is
clear
on
its
face
or
there
has
been
a
supreme
court
decision
that
says
that
the
employer
clearly
has
that
right?
surely,
at
that
point
the
city
knew
that
it...
that
it
shouldn't
be
able
to
do
this
thing.
justice
scalia
yeah,
but...
but
what
you're
arguing
now
applies
to
all
cities
in
the
future.
justice
scalia
you're
saying
no
city
in
the
future
will
ever
have
a
cause
of
action
under
1983
for
violating
what
we
said
the
law
is
in...
in...
in
golden
state
one.
