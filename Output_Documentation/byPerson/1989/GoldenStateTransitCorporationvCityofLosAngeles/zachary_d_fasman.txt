mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
city
of
los
angeles
forced
golden
state
out
of
business
because
we
refused
to
settle
a
labor
dispute
with
the
teamsters.
this
court
held
that
the
city's
decision
to
deny
us
a
franchise
was
precluded
by
the
language
and
legislative
history
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
because
congress
intended
to
allow
management
and
labor
full
freedom
to
bargain
and
to
use
economic
weapons
during
a
labor
dispute
without
government
sanction.
where
congress
decrees
that
specific
private
conduct
shall
be
free
from
government
sanction
and
then
a
sanction
is
imposed
upon
that
conduct
by
a
city,
a
classic
case
for
the
application
of
section
1983
is
presented.
this
is
especially
true
here,
because
the
improper
destruction
of
a
lawful
business
is
a
property
injury
that
has
been
recognized
in
our
courts
for
200
years
as
deserving
of
full
compensation.
full
recoveries
traditionally
have
been
available
against
cities
who
partake
of
no
eleventh
amendment
immunity
from
damages.
the
rule
in
our
courts
under
section
1983
is
that
cities
are
fully
liable
for
the
consequences
of
their
illegal
actions.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
no,
we
are
not.
the
test
under
section
1983
is
whether
we
were
denied
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
secured
by
federal
law.
our
position
is
that
the
traditional
section
<nineteen
eighty-three>
[=
1983]
tests,
repeatedly
endorsed
by
this
court,
should
govern
whether...
the
question
of
whether
we
were
denied
such
rights,
privileges
and
immunities.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
yes.
no,
we
don't...
we
don't
contend
that
all
supremacy
clause
claims
arise
under
section
1983,
as
i
think
we've
made
clear
in
our...
in
our
papers.
the
traditional
test
endorsed
by
this
court
under
section
1983
require
a
finding
that
we
did...
we
were
in
fact
denied,
rights,
privileges
and
immunities
under
federal
law.
this
court
repeatedly
has
made
clear
that
rights
enforceable
under
the
statute
arise
when
the
constitutional
or
a
federal
statute
imposes
mandatory
obligations
upon
local
government.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
i
think
that
in
this
case
the
mere
finding
of
preemption
rested
upon
the
proposition
that
congress
specifically
decreed
that
private
parties
shall
have
the
right
to
engage
in
certain
conduct;
that
is,
collective
bargaining
and
the
use
of
economic
weapons
during
a
labor
dispute.
i
think
that
that
is
different
than
the
normal
type
of
finding
of...
of
preemption
that
involves,
for
example,
federal
regulatory
schemes
and
more
amorphous
findings.
in
this
case,
we
have
specific
rights
that
were
granted
to
us
by
congress,
and
those
rights
were
obviously...
were
obviously
denied
when
we
were
put
out
of
business
for
our...
for
our
exercising
them.
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
what
this
court's
initial
opinion
said
was
that
the...
was
that
this
case
involves
mandatory
obligations
that
is...
that
are
imposed
upon
the
city
by
federal
law.
the
court's
first...
first
ruling
in
golden
state
reaffirm
that
the
language
and
legislative
history
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
evidence
clear
congressional
intent
to
ban
all
municipal
coercion
at
the
bargaining
table,
and
that's
been
accepted
federal
law
since
the
1976
ruling
in
the
machinists
case.
this
is
not
a
case
like
pennhurst
in
which
congress
has
exhorted
rather
than
commanded.
equally
important,
this
mandatory
ban
on
municipal
coercion
was
intended
for
the
especial
benefit
of
unions
and
employers
like
golden
state.
we
do
not
stand
before
the
court
as
an
incidental
beneficiary
of
the
law
designed
to
protect
the
general
public
weal.
the
preface
to
the
taft-hartley
act
is
specific.
it
states
that
the
purpose
of
the
law
is
to
prescribe
the
legitimate
rights
of
employers
and
employees.
the
national
labor
relations
act
speaks...
speaks
in
terms
of
the
parties'
rights
and
obligations.
the
right
to
strike
is
granted
to
organized
labor.
the
lockout
inheres
in
management,
and
congress
granted
both
sides
full
freedom
of
contract
and
the...
the
right
to
resist
the
other's
economic
strength
during
a
labor
dispute.
these
are
not
generic
public
rights
of
equal
interest
to
all
citizens.
they
are
specific
entitlements
granted
by
congress
to
the
parties
in
order
to
allow
them
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
order
their
own
affairs
without
government
interference.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
yes,
this
was
pleaded
under
1983
at
the
time.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
the
court--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--a
judgment.
the
court
did
not
reach
the
issue
of
relief
in
that
case.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
there
is
a
prayer
for
declaratory
relief,
injunctive
relief
and
damages,
yes.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
yes,
that's
right,
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings
not
inconsistent.
it
came
before
the
court,
as
i
remember--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--that
did
not
come
up
the
last
time
we
argued
the
case.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
it
was
not
raised,
that's
right.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
that's
right.
we're
still
on
the
pleadings
in
this
case.
that's
exact...
that's
exactly
right.
the
case,
justice
white,
the
case
came
up
on
summary
judgment
that
was
granted
to
the
city,
and
that
summary
judgment,
this
court
found,
was
wrong
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
the
remedial
issue
was
not...
was
not
reached
in
the
case.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
yes.
the
city...
the
city
in
the
district
court
opposed
the
award
of
ancillary
damages
and
indicated
that
they
were
not...
that
ancillary
damages
were
not
properly
entered
in
this
case
either
as
a
matter
of
law
or
as
a
matter
of
fact.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
the...
the
authority,
justice
kennedy,
is...
is
basically
the
equitable
authority
that
inheres
in
the
court
to
assure
that
injunctive
relief
is
not...
is
not
a
hollow
remedy
or
a
nullity.
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
the...
the
lower
court
ruled
and
i
believe
the...
the...
i
can't
recall
quite
precisely
right
now
what
the
name
of
those
cases
are.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
yes,
there
is
supreme
court
authority
to
that...
to
that
effect.
i
have
to
say
that
the
ancillary
damages
that...
that
the
district
court
awarded
in
this
case,
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
papers,
are
likely
to
yield
nothing
to
golden
state
because
the
court
balanced
our
tangible
assets
against
our
intangible
liabilities,
and
it's
plainly
an...
an
inadequate
remedy.
the
question
before
the
court,
it
seems...
it
seems
to
me,
and
the
question
raised
by
the
ninth
circuit
below,
is
whether
there
is
any
warrant
for
departing
from
the
traditional
section
1983
tests
in
this
case.
we
say
no.
the
essential
question
in
every
section
1983
case,
preemption
or
otherwise,
is
the
same:
have
federally
guaranteed
rights,
privileges
or
immunities
been
denied?
if
so,
and
if
congress
has
not
foreclosed
access
to
section
1983
by
devising
an
alternative
statutory
remedy,
section
1983
is
available.
none
of
the
briefs
before
the
court
claim
that
section
1983
is
inapplicable
in
every
preemption
case,
and
the
court
below
did
not
so
hold.
the
supremacy
clause
is
involved
in
some
way
in
every
section
1983
case,
statutory
or
constitutional,
because
it
alone
obliges
local
governments
to
obey
federal
law.
even
in
constitutional
cases,
the
supremacy
clause
is
violated
because
the
local
government
has
failed
to
accord
federal
law
the
priority
that
it
deserves.
thus,
it
cannot
be
that
section
1983
never
applies
in
any
preemption
case
or
any
case
involving
the
supremacy
clause
because,
by
definition,
every
section
1983
case
in
some
way
involves
the
supremacy
clause.
for
this
reason,
all
of
the
briefs
before
the
court--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--that...
that--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--i
do
stand
corrected.
that's
right.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
the
private
conduct.
that's
exactly
right.
undertaken...
under
color
of
state
law;
that
is
right.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
it
is--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--i
think...
i
think
this
may
be
a
very
nice
juridical...
juridical
point.
i
think
that
may
be...
that
may
be
right
if
there
were
no
supremacy
clause,
but
there
is
a
supremacy
clause;
and
whatever
the
fourteenth
amendment
says,
even
if
it
says
no
state
shall
deny,
nonetheless,
the
point
that
i'm
making
is
that
the
supremacy
clause
says
that
the
state
shall
obey
that
amendment.
so,
it
is
involved
in
some
way
in
every...
in
every
case,
although
that...
it
is
an
interesting
case,
as
if
there
were
no
supremacy
clause.
my
point
is,
though,
that
the
dispute
before
the
court
is
not
whether
section
1983
applies
in
some
preemption
cases.
everyone
seems
to
agree
that
it
does.
the
dispute
is
what
test
should
be
used
to
determine
whether
section
1983
applies.
we
see
absolutely
no
reason
to
depart
from
the
traditional
standards
used
by
this
court
and
by
most
courts
below
in
this...
in
this
or
any
other
section
1983
case.
under
those
standards,
whether
congress
created
rights,
privileges
or
immunities
depends
upon
the
intent
of
the
legislature.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
i
think
the
question
in
all
section
1983
cases
goes
back
to
the
intent
of
the
legislature.
i
think
machinists
is
based
upon
a
clear
read...
reading
of
the
language,
legislative
history
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
and,
in
fact,
has
a
statutory
basis.
it
is
true
that
it
was
iterated
by
the
court,
but
i
think
the
foundation
of
machinists
is
very
clear
both
in
term...
both
in
terms
of
the
language
and
the
legislative
history.
so
i
don't
think
that
makes
a
difference.
i
think
the
test
is
the
same.
the
question
is
what
did
congress
intend,
and
that's
our
basic
point
here.
the
court's
already
determined
in
its
ruling
what
congress
intended.
we
went
back
down
to
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
court
below,
and
they
said,
well,
we
don't
have
to
look
at
congressional
intent.
that's
not
the
test.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
i
think,
in
essence,
it
did.
it
did
not
in
so
many...
in
so
many
words,
because,
mr.
chief
justice,
what
the
court
said
was
that...
and
reiterated,
actually,
that
management
and
labor
have
these
freedoms;
that
congress
protected
this
conduct
from
government
sanction.
that
should,
in
our
view,
have
resolved
this
matter.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
the...
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
that
that
is
directly
contrary
to
the
interpretive
approach
that
this
court
has
taken
in
machinists
and
h.
k.
porter
in
the
whole
second
branch
of
the
preemption...
in
the
preemption
doctrine.
the
court
below...
one
of
our
fundamental
points
here
is
that
the
court
below
didn't
have
the
authority
to
reinterpret
the
nlra
in
a
narrowly-cabined
version
as
they
did.
this
court
has
interpreted
section
8(d)
and
has
extended
the
express
prohibition
on
nlrb
coercion
and
bargaining
to
state
and
local
governments
on
the
basis
of
congressional
intent,
which
that
should...
this
court's
rulings
along
those
lines
should
have
resolved
that
issue.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
golden
state
one--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--that's
right.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
and
that's
been
accepted
law
at
least
since
the
'76
decision
in
the
machinists
case,
where
the
court...
where
the
court
first...
first
declared
the
second
branch...
second
branch
of
the
preemption
doctrine.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
the
court
was
prepared
to
enter
an
injunction
giving
us
a
franchise
for
four
years.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
we
stayed...
this...
this
case
comes...
comes
before
the
court
on
certification.
we
stayed
all
the
proceedings--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--in...
in
the
district
court
so
that
we
could
resolve
this
issue
of
compensatory
damages
or
our
right
to
compensatory
damages
before
proceeding
to
other
remedial
issues.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
not
only...
not
only
did
the
court...
were
the
courts
below
willing
to
enter
an
injunction,
but
the
city
admitted
that
injunctive
relief
was
appropriate
here,
thus
admitting
we
have
a
cause
of
action--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--i
presume
that
it
was
directly
based
on
that
decision.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
question
and
the
point
that
you
raised,
justice
white,
is...
is
exactly...
is
exactly
right.
where's
the
warrant
for
partial
enforcement
of
these
obligations
that
the
court
imposed
upon
municipalities?
the
decision
below,
the
ninth
circuit
said
in
so
many
words
that
it
was
free
to
ignore
congressional
intent,
and
it
created
an
entirely
new
test
that
would
be
applied
to
this
case
that
undercuts
this
court's
ruling
in
golden
state.
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
even
though
congress
intended
to
ban
the
city's
conduct,
section
1983
relief
was
not
available,
and
i
quote,
because,
quote,
"the
national
labor
relations
act
does
not
explicitly
prohibit
the
city
from
acting
in
the
area
of
labor
relations.
"
this
court's
never
sanctioned
any
explicit
prohibition
test
in
any
section
1983
cases.
judge
alarcon
noted
in
his
concurrence
below,
this
court
repeatedly
has
held
that
in
deciding
whether
congress
created
rights,
privileges
or
immunities,
the
key
to
the
inquiry
is
the
intent
of
the
legislature.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
i
don't
think...
i
don't
follow
your...
your
point,
justice
scalia.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
i
thought
you
were.
[laughter]
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
the
ninth
circuit
even
went
further
by
saying,
based
on
its
express
language
test,
that
the
nlra,
and
i
quote
again,
"imposes
obligations
only
upon
an
employer
and
a
labor
union.
"
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
i
think
under
the
standard
accepted
test
that
the
courts
applied
in
section
1983
cases,
we
fall
clearly
within
it.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
that...
that
may
be,
but
i
think
the...
i
think
our
essential
point
is
that
that
would
be
a
very
unusual
result
if
we
have
rights,
privileges
or
immunities,
and
i
think
under
the
court's
traditional
standards
we
do,
the
proposition
that
we're
entitled
only
to
injunctive
relief
would
be
extraordinarily
unusual
because
congress
created
a
broad
damage
remedy
that
allows
citizens
deprived
of
rights,
privileges
and...
and
immunities
guaranteed
under
federal
law
to
sue
for
damages
in
the
federal
courts,
and
that's
precisely
our
claim
in
this
case.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
no.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
that's...
that's...
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
justice
white--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--well,
justice
white,
it
seems...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
premise
of
your...
of
your
argument
is
that
there
is
no
statutory
basis
for
the
machinists
doctrine,
and
that's
just
not
right.
i
mean,
there's
ample
statutory
basis
for
machinists.
there's
ample
legislative
history
supporting
it.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
yes,
for
preemption.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--and
the
answer
to
that
is
it
depends
on
whether
what
they
have
done
contravenes
rights,
privileges
or
immunities
granted
to
us.
my
point
is
and
our
point
here--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--well,
but
the
point
is
that
if
we
have
a
right,
privilege
or
immunity
that's
enforceable
otherwise
under
section
1983,
we're
entitled
to
damages
for
the
infringement
of
that
right.
my
point
is
not
that
it's
just
preemption
but
that
we
were
granted
rights,
privileges
or
immunities;
that
we
were
granted
the
right
to
bargain
free
from
government
sanction;
that
we
were
granted...
labor
is
granted
the
right
to
strike,
we
were
granted
the
right
to
outlast
a
strike,
to
use
economic
weapons
against
one
another.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
i
think
there...
there
are
many.
i
think
there
are
many
cases
where...
where
you
can't
justifiably
say
that
the
basis
of
preemption
is
congressional
or
constitutional
protection
of
specific
private
conduct.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
for
example,
a...
a
broad
regulatory
scheme,
a
scheme...
and
you'll
pardon
me
if
i
don't...
if...
if
i
don't
get
the...
the
precise
area
correctly,
but
if
congress,
for
example,
says
we're
preempting
the
area
of
nuclear...
transportation
of
nuclear
waste
and
says...
says
not...
not
in
an
effort
to
grant
rights
and
not
in
an
effort
to
say
a
specific
party
shall
have
the
specific
right
to
do
x,
y
or
z
but
just
says
this
is
an
area
of
federal
concern
and
the
state
takes
an
action
in
there,
in
that
area,
that
is
preempted,
that
doesn't
necessarily
sound
in
damages
because
there's
no
right--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--well,
i
presume
that
someone...
someone
who
is--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--someone
who
is--
[laughter]
someone
who
is--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--sure.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
they
might,
and
they
might
depending
upon
the
nature
of
why
congress--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--i
think
the
real
question
in
that
case
is
whether
the
law
was
passed
for
the
especial
benefit
of
the
people
who
would
transport--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--well,
if
it's...
if
that's
a
clear
reading
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
for
example,
if...
if
there
were
history
in
the
statute
that
says
that
the
reason
that
congress
federalized
the
field
was
to
protect
the
right
to
haul
nuclear
waste
across
city
lines,
sure.
i
think
that
then
you
meet
the
especial
benefit
test,
and
you
have
a
mandatory
obligation.
you
meet
the
normal
section
1983
test.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
that
was
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make.
it
may
not
be
that
the
preemption
or
the
basis
for
preemption
is
designed
to
protect
any
specific
private
conduct--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--and
if
it
isn't--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--i
think
what
you're
entitled
to
is...
is
an
injunction,
but
you
don't
fall
under
the
terms
of
section
1983.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
because
the...
the
law
was
not
passed
for
your
especial
benefit.
you
don't
fall
within--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--well,
that's
the
test
that...
that's
one
of
the
tests
that
the
court
traditionally
has
used
to
determine
whether
there
is
an
enforceable
right,
privilege
or
immunity.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
no,
i
think
in
this...
in
this
as
well.
i
think
the
court
has
applied
that
especial
benefit
test
under
section
1983
as
well.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
you're
raising...
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
raising
a
standing
question
as
opposed
to...
as
opposed
to
this
issue.
and
it
is
true.
i
mean,
the...
the
notion
of
cause
of
action
and
standing
really
do
get
close
to
one
another,
and
it
may...
it
might--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--in
any
case.
i
think
it
would
be
a--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--i'm
comfortable
with
that
result,
of
course.
[laughter]
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
i
think
i've
tried
as
best
i
can
to...
to
show
how
preemption
cases
under
these...
under
this
especial
benefit
test
that
the
court
has
used,
where
the
proper...
the
proper
inquiry
is
to
look
and
see
if
a
party
is
an
especial
beneficiary
of
the
particular
law.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
it's
the
first
prong
of
cort
v.
ash,
and
this
court
has
held
that
the
first
prong
is
useful
in
determining
whether
a
right
enforceable
under
section
1983
arises
here.
it's
not
the
full
cort
test.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
yes.
right.
i
think
the...
the
underlying
point
that
we
would
like
to...
we'd
like
to
leave
with
the
court
is
that
the
ninth
circuit's
test,
this
explicit
prohibition
test,
leads
us
to
completely
illogical
results.
it's
illogical
to
conclude,
as
did
the
ninth
circuit,
that
congress
intended
to
protect
employers
and
unions
from
the
city's
conduct
yet
simultaneously
intended
to
deprive
them
of
remedies
normally
available
in
the
federal
courts.
it's
similarly
ill...
illogical
to
conclude
that
the
obligations
congress
imposed
upon
the
city
are...
are
entitled
to
less
than
complete
enforcement,
merely
because
this
court
relied
on
the
legislative
history
before
rendering
its
decision.
our
injuries
are
no
less
real
and
no
less
contrary
to
the
will
of
congress
because
this
case
involves
legislative
history.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
just
one
or
two
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
legislative
intent
underlying
the
national
labor
relations
act
was
fully
revealed
in
golden
state
and
before
it
in
machinists,
and
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
bear
in
mind
the
broad
context
of
the
federal
labor
laws
in
which
this
case
arises.
this
court
repeatedly
has
recognized
that
free
collective
bargaining
is
the
cornerstone
of
the
federal
labor
scheme.
bargaining
can't
be
free
and
unfettered
as
intended
by
congress
if
management
or
labor
can
be
punished
for
their
stance
at
the
bargaining
table.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
well,
the
employer
versus
employee...
branch
of
the
preemption
document
deals
with
the...
deals
with
a
different
issue.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
that's
exactly
right.
and
that's
why--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--it
is
generally
correct.
but
that's
why
this
case
is
so
clearly
antithetical
to
the
intent
of
congress.
the
national
labor
relations
act
was
passed,
we
federalized
the
law
of
labor
relations
to
ensure
that
just
this
wouldn't
happen.
the
first
third
of
the
century,
this
is
what
cities
did.
they
put...
they
put...
usually
against
labor,
but
they
put
people
in
jail.
they
applied
the
antitrust
laws.
they
prevented
union
organizing.
they
prevented
strikes.
i
mean,
this
is
the
classic...
this,
if
anything,
this
is
more
of
a
machinists
case
than
machinists,
and
that's
my
fundamental
point.
bargaining
can't
go
on
if
you
can
be
put
out
of
business
because
of
your
stance
at...
stance
at
the
table.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
certainly.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
we
could
have
pled
just
a
violation
of
the
supremacy
clause
in
a
federal
question.
i
think
we
could
have.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
there's
a
question
as
to
whether
you
have
an
implied
right
of
action
under
the...
under
the
labor
laws
or
under
the
supremacy
clause
as
such.
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
in
an
implied
right
of
action?
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
i
presume
we
would
have,
yes.
but
the
point
is
that
we
did
plead
it
under
section
1983,
and
so
i
think
that
gets
us
right
to--
mr.
zachary
d.
fasman
--i
think
we
have
one
under
cort
as
well.
i
don't...
i
don't
agree
with
that
characterization,
but
i
think
we're
well
past...
we're
well
past
that.
there's
no
question
that
we
have...
that
we
have
a...
a
cause
of
action,
jurisdiction,
standing.
we've
got
a
remediable
wrong
and
an
admission
that
injunctive
relief
is
appropriate
here.
we've
left
cort
v.
ash
a
long...
a
long...
a
long
way
back,
it
seems
to
me.
the
message
that's...
that's
imposed
by
the
ninth
circuit
decision,
it
seems
to
me,
is
completely
inconsistent
with
machinists,
with
golden
state,
with
free
and
unfettered
bargaining
and
inconsistent
with
this
court's
repeated
efforts
to
protect
the
bargaining
process
and
the
parties
to
that
process
from
government
coercion.
the
problem
with
the
decision
below
is
not
just
that
it
ignores
congressional
intent
but
that
it
stands
congressional
intent
on
its
head,
and
that
decision
should
not
be
allowed
to
stand.
thank
you.
