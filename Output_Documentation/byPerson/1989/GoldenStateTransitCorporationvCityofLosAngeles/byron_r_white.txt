justice
white
in...
in
the
golden
state
case
that
we
decided,
was
that
a
1983
case?
justice
white
and
what
was
the
relief
granted?
justice
white
a
judgment
or
an
injunction?
justice
white
was
there
a
prayer
for
an
injunction?
justice
white
we
just...
we
just
ended
up
with
a
judgment?
justice
white
was
there
any
claim
in
that
case
that
the
preemption
claim
was
not
a
proper
subject
for
a
1983
case?
justice
white
it
was
not...
it
was
not
raised?
justice
white
but
i
suppose
if
it
had
been
raised,
there
would
be
the
same
sort
of
an...
would
have
been
a
same
sort
of
an
argument
then
as
there
is
here.
justice
white
on...
on
remand
and
in
golden
state
one,
was
there
an
injunction
entered?
justice
white
but
it
didn't?
justice
white
oh,
i
see.
justice
white
of
course,
if
there
were
an
injunction
ever
entered,
it
certainly
would
have
been
based
on
the
fact
that...
that
this
preemption,
this
so-called
preemption
right
really
entitled
somebody
to
an
injunction.
justice
white
and
i
suppose
that
was
based
a
lot
on
our
decision
in
golden
state
one?
[laughter]
justice
white
it
may
be
that
you...
that...
that
the
nlra
created
a
right
to
be
free
from
this
kind
of
regulation,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
you
have
a
right
for
damages...
to
damages.
justice
white
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
congress
may
have
intended
an
injunction
but
didn't
intend
any
right
to
damages,
just
because
the
city
was
doing
what
it
shouldn't
have
done.
justice
white
of
course,
there's
no
express
preemption
in...
in
nlra.
justice
white
this
is
a...
this
is
a
court
interpretation
of
what
congress
intended.
justice
white
and
you
could
say,
i
suppose,
that
this,
all
they
really
intended
to
do
was
to
protect
federal
power,
and
injunction
is
enough.
justice
white
if
you
want
to...
if
we've...
if
we've
fashioned
this
preemption
notion
when
it's...
when
it...
even
though
a
statute
is
silent,
i
suppose
we
still
have
an
unresolved
question
of
whether...
whether
damages
are...
are
permissible.
justice
white
you
mean
that's
just
for
preemption?
justice
white
all
right,
that's
fine.
but
that
isn't
my
point.
my
point
is,
although
the
statute
is...
although
the
city's
action
is
preempted,
are
they
liable
for
damages?
justice
white
in
addition
to
an
injunction.
justice
white
well,
not
necessarily.
you
recognize
a
right
by
granting
an
injunction.
justice
white
someone
like
us.
justice
white
but
he...
but
do
you
say
he
is
entitled
to
an
injunction
under
1983?
justice
white
how
did
the
plaintiff
in
golden
state
one
get
into
the
federal
court?
what
was
the
jurisdictional
basis?
justice
white
i'm
not...
i'm
asking
about
jurisdiction.
justice
white
all
right,
and
what's
the
basis
for
the
cause
of
action?
you
need
something...
some
authority
for
a
cause
of
action,
too,
don't
you?
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
you
could
have...
do
you
think
you
could
have
gotten...
they
could
have
gotten
into
the
federal
court
without
pleading
1983?
justice
white
why
would
that
get
them
in...
into
federal
court?
justice
white
that
may
be
what
this
case
is
all
about.
justice
white
could
you
have
maintained
your
action
under...
in...
in
golden
state
one
without
resorting
to
1983?
could
you
have
just--
justice
white
--just
pled
the
national
labor
relations
act?
justice
white
and...
and...
and
would
have
had
a
cause
of
action
under
the
supremacy
clause
or
a...
a
cause
of
action
under
the
labor
law,
or
both?
justice
white
and...
and
if
you
hadn't
have
used
1983,
would
you
have
gone
through
the
cort
v.
ash--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
if,
even
though
you
might
not
have
had
a
cause
of
action
under
cort
or
whatever
the
formula
is
for
implied
causes
of
action,
you
nevertheless
would
have
it
under
1983?
