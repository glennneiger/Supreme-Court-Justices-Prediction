justice
stevens
mr.
fasman,
maybe
this
really
isn't
a
difference,
but
the
rule
you
rely
on
that
a
preemption
based
on
the
machinists
analysis
and
so
forth,
you
could
really
say
that's
a
judge-made
rule
of
law
rather
than
the
clear
statutory
directive
as
we
have
in
most
1983
cases.
do
you
think
that
makes
any
difference?
justice
stevens
let
me
test
that.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
that?
justice
stevens
supposing
they
did
preempt
the
delivery
of
nuclear
waste,
and
a
state
passed
a
law
saying
you
can't
drive
through
on...
on
state
highways.
the...
that
law
would
not
be
enforceable,
and
the
nuclear
waste
disposal
company
would
have
a
federal
right
to
enjoin
enforcement
of
that
statute.
it
would
have
federal
right.
they
couldn't
get
damages
against
the
state
because
of
this
eleventh
amendment.
but
supposing
a
city
for...
forbid
them
from
driving
through
the
suburbs
or
something
like
that
and
that
was
preempted.
why
wouldn't
they
have
a
federal...
if
there's
a
federal
right
to
drive
through
the
suburbs,
why
wouldn't
they
have
a...
a
damage
action
against
the
municipality
for
interfering
with
their
free
movement
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
under
your
theory
they
always
would,
and
why
wouldn't
they?
if
there's
a
federal
right
based
on
preemption
not
to
have
the
state
interfere,
it
seems
to
me,
under
your
analysis,
the
plain
language
of
1983
would
give
them
a...
a
damage
remedy.
justice
stevens
for
the
special
benefit
of
people
who
are
in
the
business
of
hauling
nuclear
waste
around,
special
benefit
of...
of
them
as...
just
have
them
regulated
by
federal
authorities
so
that
they
wouldn't
be
overregulated
but
yet
they'd
be...
there'd
be
protection.
justice
stevens
well,
there's
nothing
in
1983
about
laws
being
passed
for
the
special
benefit
of
anybody.
justice
stevens
but
that's
in
private
cause
of
action
cases,
not
under--
justice
stevens
would
the
case
be
any
different
if
ten
years
ago
congress
had
taken
a
look
at
our
machinists
preemption
case
and
that
line
of
cases
and
passed
a
statute
saying
we
agree...
we
affirm
the
holding
of
the
supreme
court
in...
in
the
machinists
preemption
case?
would
that
change
the...
the
case?
justice
stevens
expressly
stated
we
think
that
the...
that
the
free
play
of
economic
forces
is
protected
by
the
statute
as
interpreted
in
machinists,
and
we
hereby
ratify
and
endorse
the
rule
of
machinists.
would
that--
justice
stevens
--but
also
and
to
prevent
third-party
interference
with
the
bargaining
process.
justice
stevens
in
machinists.
then
i'm
saying
what
if
the
act
went
ahead
and
said
it.
would
it
be
any
different?
if
the--
justice
stevens
--if
the
act
had
specifically
said
everything
we
put
in
the
machinists
opinion,
if
that
had
all
been
written
out
in
advance
instead
of...
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
stevens
see,
but...
but...
but
when
the
court
interprets
a
hole
in
a
statute
like
that,
it's
in
effect
saying,
well,
this
is
what
congress
really
meant
and
they
just
didn't
articulate
it
clearly
enough.
justice
stevens
you're
saying,
i
guess,
that
a
law
that...
a
federal
statute
that
preempts
state
law
does
not
give
any
individual
the
right
not
to
have
state
laws
enacted?
the...
the
preemption,
the
federal
preemption
does
not
create
rights
in
anybody.
it
just
somehow
or
other
erases
state
law.
that
seems
to
be
your
position.
justice
stevens
enforced
or--
justice
stevens
--well,
would
it
be--
justice
stevens
--but
would
it
be
different
if
there
were
a
federal
statute
that
said
no
state
legislature
or
municipality
shall
enact
any
legislation
that
interferes
with
the
bargaining
process?
if
it
said...
and
it's
a
little
broad
but
if
that's
what
they'd
said,
would
that...
would
that
then
give
the...
the
cab
company
a
right
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
but
then
your
distinction
is
not
between
preemption
and
other
kind
of
laws.
it's
between
expressly
enacted
statutes
by
congress
and
judicially
interpreted
statutes.
that's
your
distinction,
i
guess.
justice
stevens
mr.
haggerty--
justice
stevens
--before
you
leave
that,
would
you
tell
me
again
what
is
the
that
you
propose?
and
i
know...
i
know
i'm
probably
asking
you
to
repeat
yourself,
but
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
1980,
the
petitioner
operated
some
400
taxi
cabs
in
the
city
of
los
angeles.
when
its
franchise
came
up
for
renewal,
its
drivers
were
on
strike,
and
the
city
refused
to
renew
its
franchise
unless
petitioners
settled
with
the
union.
three
years
ago,
in
a
case
with
the
same
name,
we
held
that
the
city’s
decision
to
condition
the
renewal
of
petitioner’s
cab
franchise
on
the
settlement
of
a
pending
labor
dispute
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act.
on
remand,
the
district
court
enjoined
the
city
to
reinstate
the
franchise.
it
held
that
petitioner
had
no
right
to
recover
compensatory
damages
under
section
1983
of
title
42
of
the
u.s.
code.
the
united
sates
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed
and
we
granted
certiorari.
for
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
creates
rights
in
labor
and
in
management
that
are
enforceable
against
governmental
interference
under
section
1983.
we
accordingly
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justice
o’connor
have
joined.
