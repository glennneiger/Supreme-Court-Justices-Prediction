mr.
john
haggerty
honorable
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the...
in...
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
concern
or
question,
there
was,
as
counsel
indicated,
a
declaratory
relief
action
pled
in
this
case,
and
under
the
declaratory
relief,
the
plaintiff
could
get
injunctive
relief.
but
the
question
is
is
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
entitled
to
damages
under
1983.
mr.
john
haggerty
no,
i'm
not.
i'm
saying
he's
pled
a
separate
cause
of
actions
under
the
declaratory
relief
act,
and
under
that
act,
the
court
granted
an
injunction.
but
just
because
he
received
an
injunction
under
declaratory
relief
does
not
mean
that
the
plaintiff's
entitled
to
damages
under
1983,
because
the
court...
when
the
court
engages
in
a
preemption
analyses,
it's
a
different
analyses
than
the
court
engages
in
when
it
engages
in
a
1983
analyses.
mr.
john
haggerty
well,
in
order
to
enforce
the
holding
of
this
court
in
golden
state
one,
yes,
because
i...
the...
the
type
of
analyses
the
court
goes
into
in
determining
whether
or
not
there
is
preemption
is
a
different
kind
of
analyses
that
the
court
has
engaged
in
in
the
1983
action.
mr.
john
haggerty
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
haggerty
well,
the
court
in
a...
preemption
analyses,
as
this
court
did,
did
find
that
there
was
a
right
based
on
a
preemption
analyses.
what
i'm
saying
is
just
because
a
court
may
find
there
is
a
right
based
on
a
preemption
analyses
does
not
meet
the
test
that
this
court
has
laid
out
as
to
when
a
person
has
a
right
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983.
the
kind
of
analyses
a
court
engages
in,
for
example,
in
wright
v.
roanoke,
is
a
different
kind
of
analyses
than
this
court
has
engaged
in
in
labor
preemption
cases.
in
fact,
this
court
has
stated
that
it
is
not
clear
from
the
nlra
what
rights
or
what
powers
have
been
taken
from
the
states
and
what
powers
have
been
given
to
the
states.
in
fact,
the
court
even
indicates
that
engaging
in
such
a
preemption
analyses,
it
goes
through
what
the
court
refers
to
as
a
delphic
process.
in
other
words,
the
court
may
take
obscure
and
ambiguous
language
and
imply
from
that
a
right
or...
the
local
entity
has
been
preempted,
whereas
in
a
1983
cause
of
action,
this
court
has
laid
out
very
specific
rules,
as
they
did
in
wright
<v@l>
[=
v.]
roanoke
redevelopment
authority.
mr.
john
haggerty
well,
there
was
a
whole
series
of
cause
of
action.
there
was
violations
of
the
fourteenth--
mr.
john
haggerty
--oh,
they
were
claiming
under
1331
that
there
was
a--
mr.
john
haggerty
--yes.
they
were...
they
were
claiming
a
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
due
process,
equal
protection
rights.
they
were
claiming
cause
of
action
in
1983.
they
were
seeking
declaratory
relief.
they
were
seeking
injunctive
relief.
mr.
john
haggerty
well,
yes,
because...
well,
they
also
had
pled
violations
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
john
haggerty
the
federal
court
of
appeals
ruled
that
they
had
no
cause
of
action
under
14...
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
under
the
anti...
they
also
pled
antitrust
violations.
there
has
been
four
court
of
appeals
decisions
in
this
case,
and
all
the
issues
have
been
resolved,
except
the
question
of
1983.
the
city
would
submit
that
the
appropriate
legal
test
in
this
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
this
specific
law...
namely,
the
national
labor
relations
act...
granted
the
plaintiff
rights
within
the
meaning
of
1983
is
whether
or
not
congress
intended
that
a
statute
secures
rights
within
the
meaning
of
1983...
is
whether
congress
has
employed
in
the
law
sufficiently
specific
and
definite
statutory
language
in
order
to
create
rights,
at
the
same
time
give
notice
to
the
relevant
governmental
unit
of
its
obligations
in
relation
to
such
rights.
the
key
is
what
is
the
legislative
intent;
and
i
submit
the
test,
the
proposed
test
that
i
have
just
stated,
is
supported
by
this
court's
prior
decisions.
and
i
will
admit
this
language
came
from
the
district
court
of
appeals
decision
in
edwards
v.
district
of
columbia,
because
the
court
said
in
laying...
or
stating
that
language
which
i
have
just
given
to
the
court,
that
language
was
based
on
that
court's
reading
together
the
wright
case
and
the
pennhurst
case.
and
in
wright,
this
court
filed
that
the
brooke
amendment
to
the
housing
act
relating
to
rent
limitations
could
not
be
clearer
as
to
the
maximum
rent
which
could
be
charged
tenants.
this,
the
court
said,
was
a
mandatory
limitation
focusing
on
the
family
and
its
members.
the
court
concluded
that
the
benefits
congress
intended
to
confer
on
tenants
were
sufficiently
specific
and
definite
to
qualify
as
enforceable
rights
under
pennhurst
in
section
1983.
and
in
pennhurst,
the
court
said
in
order
to
create
1983
rights,
congress
should
be
expected
to
speak
with
a
clear
voice.
now,
pennhurst
and
wright
and
edwards
were
all
grant-in-aid
cases,
admittedly,
but
still
the
crucial
factor,
as
even
plaintiff
admits,
is
what
is
the
intent
of
the
legislature.
did
the
legislature
intend
to
create
rights
within
the
meaning
of
1983?
mr.
john
haggerty
well,
there
was
no--
mr.
john
haggerty
--i
know...
i
know
of
no
case
in
this
court,
no.
mr.
john
haggerty
that's
correct.
but
the
reason
i
believe
that
the
language
in
the
statute
should
be
clear
and
unambiguous,
as
pennhurst
indicates,
in
order
to
find
a
legislative
intent
to
create
rights
within
the
meaning
of
1983,
because,
to
digress
a
moment,
in
a
preemption
case
this
court
is
trying
to
further
some
kind
of
national
policy
or
promote
some
type
of
national
goal.
that
is
not
the
issue
in
a
1983
case.
the
issue
in
a
1983
case
focuses
on
whether
or
not
congress
intended
to
grant
rights
to
the
specific
individual
who
is
asserting
it.
and
it's
certainly
to
be
presumed,
if
congress
intends
to
create
substantive
rights
to...
of
others
engage
in
such
action
or
forbearance
of
those
rights
demand,
that
congress
will
use
in
the
particular
statute
such
unambiguous
language
so
as
to
command
such
action
or
forbearance.
in
other
words,
to
put
such
persons
on
notice
as
what
is
expected
from
them,
because,
after
all,
the
reason
that
congress
creates
rights
is
to
have
others
honor
those
rights.
now,
looking
at
the
statutory
language
of
8(d)
as
amended
in
the...
the
nlra
and
its
legislative
history,
it
indicate
that
that
was
not
congress'
intent.
what
does
8(d)
say
as
amended?
all
8(d)
says
is
that
the
obligation
to
bargain
in
good
faith
does
not
compel
a
party
to
reach
an
agreement.
all
that
language
expressly
provides
that
the
failure
to
reach
an
agreement
in
a
bargaining
environment
does
not
subject
that
person
to
a
charge
of
an
unfair
labor
practice.
the
section
is
very
clear.
the
only
benefit
is...
it
provides
is
what
i
have
just
stated.
unlike--
mr.
john
haggerty
--no.
again,
as
i
said,
golden
state
one
was
a
preemption
case,
and
in...
in
a
preemption
case
the
court
is
focusing
on
what
needs
to
be
done
to
further
a
national
policy.
in
a
1983
case,
the
court
is
focusing
on
whether
or
not
congress
intended
to
create
individual
rights
in
the
particular
plaintiff
who
is
asserting
it.
mr.
john
haggerty
yes,
the
court
did
find--
mr.
john
haggerty
--yes,
but
i
would
say
that
is
a
right
in
a
preemption...
preemptive
sense.
just
because
the
word
"right"
is
used,
it
has
to
be
looked
at
in
the
context
in
which
it
is
used,
just
like
in
the
pennhurst
case.
in
pennhurst,
congress
had
set
out
what
they
called
a
bill
of
rights
for
the...
the
disabled;
but
despite
of
that
this
court
did
not
find
that
the
plaintiff
in
pennhurst
had
a
right
within
the
meaning
of
1983.
now,
as
far
as
the
legislative
history
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
counsel
makes
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
act
talks
in
terms
of
the
rights
of
the
employer
and
employee.
but
what
the
act
says
in
29
u.s.c.
141,
it
talks
about
the
legitimate
rights
of
these
parties
in
their
relations
with
each
other,
and
the
purpose
is,
according
to
141
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
is
to
avoid
industrial
strike.
you
look
at
the
declared
purpose
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
all
it
speaks
of
is
the
obligations
to
the
parties
in
reference
to
each
other.
and
as
far
as
8(d)
itself
is
concerned,
that
amendment...
or,
rather,
it
was
amended
in
1947
to
provide
what
is
a
relevant
language
in
this
case,
namely,
the
refusal
to
make
a
concession
does
not
come
within...
is...
is
not
a
requirement
in
order
to
bargain
in
good
faith.
and
as
far
as
that
specific
language
is
concerned,
the
congressional
service,
discussing
the
house
bill
and
the
senate
bill
as
to
that
language,
said
that
the
reason
for
that
language
was
that
the
board
was
requiring
employers
to
make
concessions
to
show
that
they
were
bargaining
in
good
faith.
that
language
had
a
very
specific
purpose,
because
the
legislature
felt
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
was,
in
effect,
going
too
far
in
putting
pressure
on
an
employer
in
its
bargaining
with
the
union.
and,
in
fact,
this
court
in
porter
company
v.
national
labor
relations
board,
in
talking
about
that
specific
language,
pointed
out
the
reason
for
it
is
that
unless
congress
writes
into
the
law
guides
for
the
board
to
follow,
the
board
may
attempt
to
carry
this
process
still
further
and
seek
to
control
more
and
more
of
the
terms
of
collecting
bargaining
agreements.
i
submit
the
reason
for
that
language
was
not
meant
to
give
an
employer,
as
in
this
case,
rights
against
a
third
party,
but
it
was
meant
to,
in
effect,
control
what
the
legislature
saw
as
an
abuse
of
power
by
the
board.
in
looking
at--
mr.
john
haggerty
--again,
based
on
the
preemption
analyses,
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
haggerty
well,
what--
mr.
john
haggerty
--well,
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
order
to
secure
rights
within
1983,
there
should
be
some...
again,
the
court
has
always
indicated
it's
a
question
of
legislative
intent.
did
the
legislature
intend
to
confer
rights
on
this
particular
party--
mr.
john
haggerty
--no,
that's
not
my
position.
what
my
position
is
that
the
language
of
the
statute
in
some
way
has
to,
as
in
wright
v.
city
of
roanoke,
has
to
compel
the
particular
defendant
of
what
they
have
to
do.
now--
mr.
john
haggerty
--but
again,
it
was
not
the
express
language
of
the
statute
as
a
right.
the
court
implied
from
the
national
labor
relations
act--
mr.
john
haggerty
--that
the
city
had
such
an
obligation.
mr.
john
haggerty
that
is
what
i'm
saying
because
i
think
there's
a
distinction
in
the
type
of
analyses
and
the
purpose
of
preemption,
as
opposed
to
a
1983
cause
of
action.
mr.
john
haggerty
well,
you
mean
if
the
congress
expressly
stated
that--
mr.
john
haggerty
--no,
it
would
not,
i...
i
don't
believe,
because,
again,
in
the
machinists
case
and
as
far
as
the
national
labor
relations
act
is
concerned,
its
purpose
is
to
promote
industrial
peace
and
define
the
relationship
of
the
parties,
labor,
management
and
the
board,
in
reference
to
each
other.
it
has...
there
is
nothing
at
the...
in
the
act--
mr.
john
haggerty
--well,
the
act
doesn't
say
that.
that
is
the
way
the
court
has
interpreted--
mr.
john
haggerty
--well--
mr.
john
haggerty
--well,
again,
i...
it's
a
question
whether
or
not
they
would
say...
well,
i
would
tend
to
say
yes,
that...
that
probably
would
be
the
situation
if...
provided...
if...
if
there
was
expressly
stated
and
created
some
kind
of
obligation
on
the
part
of...
of
the
city...
if
the
statute
said
that,
if
the
law
said
that.
mr.
john
haggerty
no,
but
again,
i...
in
making
it...
and
i
don't
wish
to
repeat
myself
but
i
guess
i'm
sorry
if
i
do,
that
i
believe
in
a
preemption
analyses.
the
court
again
is
trying
to
further,
as
i
said,
some
type
of
national
policy,
in
this
case
a
promotion
of
industrial
peace,
and
that's
the
bases
for
its
preemption...
its
conclusions
in
reference
to
preemption.
it's
based
on
the
supremacy
clause,
namely,
to
give
priority
to
federal
bulls.
mr.
john
haggerty
well,
or
to
prevent
the
state
law
from
being--
mr.
john
haggerty
--enforced.
well,
it
could
be
express
preemption...
expression...
express
preemption,
where
there
could
be
explicit
language
in
the
statute--
mr.
john
haggerty
--which
compels
certain
actions
on
the
part
of
a
governmental
agency.
mr.
john
haggerty
i
think
if
there...
if
it's
expressed
in
the
statute,
that's
correct
because,
as
1983
says,
we're
talking
about--
mr.
john
haggerty
--well,
my
distinction
is
whether
or
not
the
statute,
looking
at
the
express
language
or
in
the
legislative
intent,
does
create
such
a
right
in
an
individual.
and
what
i'm
saying
here
is
that
both
the
legislative
intent
of...
in
1947
when
they
enacted
this
amendment
and
the
express
language
does
not
indicate
any
such
right
in
the
plaintiff.
it
has
no
language
which
in
any
way
mandates
or
compels
the
city
to
do
anything.
in
fact,
drawing
an
analogy
from
the
implied
right
of
action
cases,
which
the
court
has
referred
to
in
analyzing
<nineteen
eighty-three>
[=
1983]
actions
and
in
the
cannon
case,
the...
the
court
has
used
the
first
test,
whether
or
not
congress
intends
to
create
a
right
in
this
particular
plaintiff.
and
in
the
cannon
case,
it
points
out
that
in
talking
in
terms
of
an
implied
right
of
action
case
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
person
to
be
charged
disregarded
a
command
of
the
statute.
and
when
the
first
test
talks
about
whether
or
not
the...
the
first
prong
of
the
test
of
the
implied
right
of
action
cases
talks
about
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
is
an
especial
beneficiary
of
that
statute,
i
believe
you
have
to
look
at
that
in
terms
or
relationship
to
what
the
statute
provides.
and
in
this
case
the
statute,
by
its
language,
does
not
provide
any
benefit
as
to
an
employer
against
a
third-party
such
as
the
city.
it
only
creates
a
benefit
as
against
the
national
labor
relations
board
by
preventing
them
from
bringing
a
unfair
labor
practice
charge.
now,
i
believe
there
is
also
good
policy
for
the
test
the
city
is
laying
out.
as
fact,
as
the
plaintiff
himself
admits,
that
labor
law
is
a
very
complex
area
which
the
lower
courts
often
misunderstand.
and
if
there's
this
apparent
uncertainty
as
to
when
governmental
actions
may
be
preempted
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
then
there's
a
problem
that
local
entities,
not
knowing
when
they
may
be
liable
under
1983,
may
refrain
from
engaging
in
what
otherwise
may
be
important
and
significant
regulatory
types
of
actions.
now
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
make--
mr.
john
haggerty
--yes.
mr.
john
haggerty
yes.
the
test
is...
the
test,
the
city
submits,
is
for
determining
whether
or
not
congress
intends
that
a
statute
secure
rights
within
the
meaning
of
section
1983
is
whether
congress
has
employed
in
the
law
sufficiently
specific
and
definite
statutory
language
in
order
to
create
rights
and
at
the
same
time
give
notice
to
the
relevant
governmental
unit
of
its
obligations
in
relation
to
such
rights.
and
as
i
said,
that
language
does
come
from
a
district
court
of
appeals
decision,
edwards
v.
district
of
columbia,
and
the
court
said
that
they
utilized
that
language
by
their
reading
together
the
wright
case
and
the
pennhurst
case,
because
in
wright
the
court...
this
court
specifically
said
in
finding
that
there
were
1983
rights
that
the
congress...
that
the...
the
congress
intended
these
benefits...
the
benefits
which
congress
intended
to
confer
on
the
tenants
were
sufficiently
specific
and
definite
to
qualify
as
enforceable
rights
under
pennhurst
and
section
1983.
mr.
john
haggerty
well,
the
city
knew
at
that
point,
but,
of
course,
at
that
point
they
had
already
had
done--
mr.
john
haggerty
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
haggerty
yes,
because
that--
mr.
john
haggerty
--because,
again,
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
city
has
violated
or
acted
in
disregard
of
the
law,
and
the
law
in
this
case
does
not
command
the
city
in
any
way
to
do
what
the
plaintiff
is
asserting
it
should
do
so
as
to
get
1983
damages.
and
the
reason
that
i'm
saying...
saying
that
the
city
should
have
notice,
it's
not
because
they
can
claim,
well,
they
didn't...
some
kind
of
good-faith
defense,
which
the
court,
of
course,
has
already
rejected.
the
question
is
if
you're
looking
at
legislative
intent,
does
the
legislature
intend
to
create
these
enforceable
rights
in
a
plaintiff?
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
congress
can
speak
in
a
very
clear
way
to
so
indicate
to
the
defendant
or
to
the
governmental
entity
what
they
are
expected
to
do.
one
other
point
i
would
like
to
make
that
if...
it
was
pointed
out
in
the
brief
of
the
amicus
that
the
question
in
this
case
does...
does
not
really
address
the
issue
that
is
really
involved
here.
as
i
said,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
law...
namely,
the
national
labor
relations
act...
created
the...
the
kind
of
rights
that
plaintiff
is
asserting.
and
the
issue
in
this
case
only
relates
to
that
particular
law,
this
particular
statute.
it's
not
a
question,
as
the
question
presented
by
the
court,
is
whether
or
not
the
state
action
was
preempted
or
not.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
this
law
creates
that
kind
of
rights.
and
it's
fair
to
say
that,
if
the
question
is
presented
in
that
way
that
the
nlrb
may
have
come
into
the
case
as
an
amicus
to
give
their
expertise
as
to
whether
or
not
this
particular
statute
does
create
such
rights.
in
fact,
this
court
in
owens
v.
city
of
independence
said
in
determining
whether
or
not
a
1983
action
lies
will
look
to
see
whether
or
not
the
municipality
has
conformed
to
the
requirements
of
the
federal
constitution
and
statutes.
and
in
this
case
there
is...
the
way,
again,
the
way
the
statute
is
worded,
the
city
did
not
in
any
way
disregard
any
command
of
section
8(d).
that's
all
i
have.
thank
you.
