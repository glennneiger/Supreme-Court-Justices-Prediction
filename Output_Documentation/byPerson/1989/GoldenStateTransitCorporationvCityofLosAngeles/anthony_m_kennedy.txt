justice
kennedy
at
any
point
in
the
proceedings
has
the
city
contested
the
award
of
the
ancillary
damages?
justice
kennedy
well,
i...
i
know
it's
not
an
issue
before
us
here.
i
assume
it's
not
an
issue
before
us
here,
but
i'm
curious
to
know.
what
is
the
authority
for
the
ancillary
damages,
because
the
answer
to
that
might
bear
upon
the
issues
we're
discussing
here
today?
justice
kennedy
and...
and...
and
we
have
some
authority
to
address--
justice
kennedy
it
says
no
state
shall
deprive,
and
congress
has
specific
authority
under
that,
under
the...
the
fifth
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
to
pass
legislation
to
enforce
it.
so,
i
should
think
if
the
constitution
did
not
have
a
supremacy
clause
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
justice
kennedy
why
does
that
make
any
sense?
