the
petition...
it
used
the
word
rehearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
used
the
word
rehearing,
at
least.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
didn't
say
just
a
suggestion.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
said
rehearing.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
the
case
comes
to
us,
then,
we...
we're
dealing
with
an...
an
authorization
by
a
court
to
a
local
body
to
levy
a
tax,
rather
than...
rather
than
the
court
itself
purporting
to,
itself
to
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
farr,
let's
assume
that
the
school
board
or
the
local
officials
could
have
levied
this
xx
under
state
law,
that
they
had
the
power
to
do
it.
could
the
court
order
them
to
enact
a
certain
tax?
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
know,
but
part
of
your
argument
must
be...
you
say
it's
a
job
of
the
elected
representatives
to
pass
taxes,
pass
tax
laws.
and
so
i...
i
would
think
from
your
argument
you
would
answer
the
question,
no--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
cannot
order
the...
the
authorities
to
pass
a
tax,
even
if
you...
even
if...
even
if
they
have
the
power
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
thought
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
that...
would
you
say
that
the...
the
federal
court
would
be
out
of
bounds
if
it
said,
well,
we
realize
that
there
is
this
limitation
on
the
local
authority's
taxing
power,
but
we're
going
to
declare
that
unconstitutional
because
it's
a...
it
inhibits
a...
what
is
a
absolutely
necessary
remedy?
we
need
some
money
for
this
remedy.
so,
that
we
are
going
to
disregard
that
limitation
on
the
grounds
that
it's
unconstitutional.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
it...
what
if
the...
what
if
the
state
just
had
a...
just
had
a
rule
on
the
books,
you...
you
shall
have
no
power
ever
to
comply
with
a
court
order?
can't
you
declare
that
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here's
a
limitation
that
absolutel
inhibits
a
proper
remedy
for
a
constitutional
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
excuse
me,
i
though
that
they
affirmed
that.
they
say
we
affirm
the
actions
that
the
district
court
has
taken
to
this
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
modified
the
procedure
for
the
future.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
they
affirmed,
expressly
affirmed,
that
additional
levy
for
those
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
snyder,
do
you
see
any
difference
between...
on...
legally
between
what
the
district
court
did
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
should
be
done
in
the
future?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
both
of
them...
both
of
them
are
proper?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that...
is
that
issue
before
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
money's
already
been
collected,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
affirmed...
it
affirmed
what
the
district
court
did
for
a
couple
of
years.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
issue
before
us?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
by
a
five-to-four
vote
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
in
missouri
against
jenkins,
no.
88-1150.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
the
chief
justice
and
justices
oâ€™conner
