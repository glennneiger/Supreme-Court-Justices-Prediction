mr.
farr,
is
the
district
court
following
the
modifications
that
the
eighth
circuit
put
on?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
franken...
i'm
sorry,
had
you
finished
your
answer?
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this?
if
we
just
confine
our
attention
for
a
moment
to
the
question
we
granted
cert
on,
you...
you'll
recall
we
limited
the
grant
to
the
question
of
power.
on
that
issue,
isn't
it
clear
that
the
position
you're
advocating
is
against
the
best
interests
of
your
client?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
puzzles
me--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
i'm
assuming
we
just...
just
answered
the
question
we
granted
cert
to
decide...
the
question
of
power.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
right
there,
supposing
at
the
time
the
eighth
circuit
initially
denied
the
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc,
it
had
said
the
petition
for
rehearing
and
the
suggestion
for
rehearing
en
banc
are
both
denied,
basically
what
they
said
in
the
nunc
[inaudible].
say
they
had
said
that
the
first
time.
what
would
your
view
of
the
case
be
then?
