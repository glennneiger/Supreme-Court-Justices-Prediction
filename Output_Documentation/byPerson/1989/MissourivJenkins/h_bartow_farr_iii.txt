mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issues
in
this
case
are
important
ones
regarding
the
nature
and
extent
of
federal
judicial
power.
the
eighth
circuit
has
held
that
a
federal
court,
in
seeking
to
remedy
a
constitutional
violation,
can
give
higher
authority
for
state
taxes
than
state
law
allows,
and
it
further
has
held
that
the
district
court
properly
exercised
that
authority
in
this
case.
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
both
counts.
in
our
view,
a
federal
court
can't
authorize
a
government
to
tax
its
citizens
without
its
consent,
and
it
certainly
can't
do
so
without
showing
that
no
other
remedy
and
no
other
means
of
financing
is
available.
xx
before
turning
to
the
merits,
i'd
like
to
spend
a
few
minutes
on
the
issue
of
jurisdiction
in
this
court.
the
basic
issue
seems
to
us
pretty
straightforward:
did
the
court
of
appeals
treat
our
rehearing
petition,
which
sought
en
banc
review,
as
a
petition
for
rehearing
as
well
as
one
for
en
banc?
if
it
did,
and
several
circuits
have
made
an
express
practice
of
treating
petitions
this
way,
then
it
seems
clear
to
us
that
under
the
rules
the
time
for
seeking
review
in
this
court
was
tolled
until
after
the
petition
was
denied.
now,
the
eighth
circuit
has
said
itself
how
it
treated
this
particular
petition.
in
an
order
that
it
entered
nunc
pro
tunc
it
said
that
it
had
denied
petitions
for
rehearing
with
suggestions
for
rehearing
en
banc,
and
it
corrected
its
earlier
order
to
reflect
that
fact.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
treat
the
order
in
that
particular
way
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
there's
certainly
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
order
or
anything
that
it
suggests
that
it
is
simply
doing
that
as
an
accommodation
to
the
parties.
secondly,
it
is
in
fact
the
regular
practice
of
the
eighth
circuit
to
treat
petitions
for
rehearing
en
banc
as
petitions
for
rehearing
with
suggestions
for
rehearing
en
banc,
just
as
several
other
circuits
do,
as
i
say,
express
a--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that
is
what
we
understand
from
the
clerk's
office,
that
this
is
a
practice
that
was
instituted
well
before
the
petition
was
filed
in
this
case
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
does
follow,
and
it
is...
our
understanding
is
the
only
reason
it
was
not
followed
in
this
case
was
simply
a
matter
of
inadvertence
in
the
clerk's
office.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
i
can't
certainly
say
that
i
know
of
no
instances
in
which
it
was
not
done.
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
do
understand
that
from
a
period
of
time
beginning,
i
believe,
sometime
in
1987,
that
the
court
has
been
following
this
practice
as
a
general
matter
and
they
have--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--it
does
not
have
an
express
rule
to
that
effect,
no.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
no,
your
honor,
there
was
not.
now,
i
would
say,
though,
i
don't
think
that
in
any
sense
the
court
of
appeals
are
or
should
be
limited
by
what
is
specifically
asked
for
in
the
petition.
as
i
say,
in
these
other
circuits
which
do
have
it
as
an
express
matter
of
rule,
there
is
no
requirement
that,
in
order
for
the
rule
to
come
into
play,
you
actually
have
to
have
said,
i
would
like
rehearing
from
the
panel,
in
the
process
of
applying
for
rehearing
at
all.
they
simply
have
decided
as
a
matter
of
internal
court
business
that
that
would
be
the
more
flexible
way
to
deal
with
these,
in
fact,
i
think
to
eliminate
some
of
the
confusion
that
has
arisen
out
of
problems
like
this
one.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i'm
sorry?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
our
particular
petition
did,
yes.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
it
used
the
word
rehearing
specifically,
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
just
when...
i'm
sorry
if
i
wasn't
clear.
it's
the
eighth
circuit's
clerk's
office
that
i
was
talking
about.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
what
they
have
informed
us,
just
once
again,
is
that
when
a
petition
is
filed,
even
if
it
is
entitled
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc,
it
has
become
the
regular
practice
of
the
eighth
circuit
to
treat
that
as
a
petition
for
rehearing
with
a
suggestion
for
en
banc.
and
what
the
court
did,
therefore,
in
its
order...
its
amended
order...
was
simply
to--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
if
a
petition
for
rehearing
is
filed,
that
does
toll
the
time
under
this
court's
rules.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
in
fact,
the
court's
rules
state
a
petition
for
rehearing.
they
don't
specifically
specify
the
panel,
but
i
think
that
is
at
least--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that
is
my
understanding
of
what
it
means--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--your
honor,
my
understanding
is
that
the
practice
in
this
court
is
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
issues
an
order
and
says,
we
have
essentially
treated
this
only
as
a
suggestion
for
a
rehearing
en
banc,
this
court
has
not
taken
that
to
toll
the
time.
but
again,
i
would
like
to
go
back
and
say
that
is
not
what
the
eighth
circuit
has
done
here.
the
eighth
circuit
has
said,
we
have
treated
this
as
a
petition
for
rehearing
with
a
suggestion
for
rehearing.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
i
don't
know
of
anything
that
would
prevent
a
court
of
appeals,
certainly
before
this
court
has
ruled
on
a
petition,
from
saying
we
have
made
a
mistake
in
the
form
of
our
order,
or
the
order
should
have
read
differently
from
the
particular
order
that
was
entered
and
we
would
like
to
correct
that
order
and
to
reflect
it.
that
seems
to
me
fully
within
the
power
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
there's
no
question,
this
court
has
to
determine
whether
to
give
effect
to
the
order
of
the
eighth
circuit
or
not.
i'm
not
saying
that...
that
that
is
not
an
issue
before
the
court.
what
i
am
saying,
though,
is
that
there
is
no
good
reason
not
to
give
effect
to
the
order
of
the
eighth
circuit,
because
it
is
reflecting
its
practice,
and
what
the
eighth
circuit
says,
at
least
in
its
order,
was
in
fact
what
it
did
in
this
case,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
reason
to
second-guess
the
eighth
circuit
on
that.
one
other
point
i
would
make,
at
least
as
some
independent
evidence
to
suggest
that
the
eighth
circuit
is
not
engaging
in
some
sort
of
device
or
sham,
here,
is
what
happened
with
the
mandate.
under
the
rules
of...
the
federal
appellate
procedure
rule
35,
the
mandate
would
not
automatically
be
stayed
simply
by
a
petition
or
suggestion
for
rehearing
en
banc.
but
there's
no
question,
in
this
case,
that
the
mandate
was
automatically
stayed.
there
is
no
order
staying
that,
but
the
mandate
did
not
issue
until
after
the
petition
was
denied,
so
we
think
that
what
the
court's
order
says
is
consistent
with,
in
fact,
the
way
the
court
showed
it
treated
the
petition
at
the
time
the
petition
was
filed.
now,
turning
to
the
merits,
as
i
have
said,
the
case
involves
questions
first
about
whether
federal
courts
can
ever
give
authority
for
higher
state
taxes
and,
second,
whether
they
could
do
so
here.
and
these
questions
involve,
i
think,
some
common
issues
about
just
what
judicial
power
is
and
how
it
ought
to
be
exercised.
i
begin
with
what
i
think
are
two
relatively
uncontroversial
propositions.
first
of
all,
that
the
federal
courts
do
have
broad
remedial
powers
to
correct
for
constitutional
violations.
the
second
point,
however,
is
that
that
power
is
subject
to
limitation,
in
particular,
limitations
that
are
drawn
from
the
constitution
itself.
and
these
limitations
can
be
of
different
kinds.
for
example,
they
can
be
absolute
limitations,
ones
that
completely
bar
the
use
of
judicial
power
in
a
particular
circumstance,
or
they
can
be
more
flexible.
they
can
be
limitations
that
allow
the
courts
to
exercise
power
but
require
the
courts
to
take
account
of
other
important
institutional
interests.
now,
for
example,
in
the
first
category
i
think
a
federal
court
simply
could
not
tell
a
senator
or
a
congressman
to
refrain
from
activities
which
are
protected
under
the
speech
and
debate
clause,
and
in
fact
the
court
so
held
in
eastland
v.
u.s.s.
f
in
421
u.s.
nor
do
we
think
a
federal
court
could
tell
the
president
that
it
had
to
appoint
a
particular
cabinet
official.
sovereign
immunity,
where
it
applies,
can
be
an
absolute
barrier
to
relief.
but
then
there
are
other
doctrines
which
fall
under
the
second
category,
doctrines
like
comity
and
judicial
restraint,
which...
which
do
require
the
courts
to
give
weight
to
other
branches
of
government
or,
in
the
case
of
comity,
to
state
and
local
governments.
it's
simply
not
correct,
therefore,
as
a
starting
point
for
this
discussion,
to
say
that
a
federal
court
can
always
bring
about
a
particular
result,
or
should
always
bring
about
a
particular
result
in
a
case
before
it,
and
indeed,
the
particular
case
cited
by
the
eighth
circuit
for
the
idea
that
courts
generally
must
have
the
power
to
carry
out
their
particular
orders
is
marbury
v.
madison,
a
case
in
which
this
court
held
that
it
did
not
have
the
power
under
article
3
to
give
the
relief
that
the
litigants
sought.
now,
what
has
happened
in
this
particular
case
is
that
the
courts
below
have
ventured
into
new
ground.
we
believe
for
the
first
time
ever,
a
federal
court
has
authorized
a
government
to
assess
and
levy
taxes
that
its
citizens
haven't
authorized.
there
seem
to
be
some
very
good
reasons,
and
i
will
discuss
them,
why
this
power
may
be
absolutely
beyond
the
reach
of
the
federal
courts.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
i
have
stated
it
that
way
because
first
of
all
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
which
of
the
two
it
is.
i
think
they're
both
improper,
but
just
to
save
quibbling
over
it,
i
think
what
in
fact
happened
is
that
the
district
court
ordered
the
school
district
to
levy
the
tax.
the
eighth
circuit
then
essentially
said
well,
we
will
authorize,
we
will
change
this
slightly
so
that
we
will
authorize
the
school
district
to
levy
the
tax.
there
is
no
question,
however,
that
if
the
school
district
said,
now
that
we've
been
authorized
to
levy
the
tax,
we've
decided
not
to
levy
it,
that
an
order
would
be
forthcoming,
at
least
under
the
way
the
courts
below
have
treated
it
to
date.
so
i
think
that
the
authorization
is
in
fact
one
that
is
backed
up
by
the
order.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
the...
there
certainly
was
an
order
that
applied
before...
to
a
tax
year
before
the
court
of
appeals
got
involved,
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
after
that
what
they're
saying
is,
we'll
follow
a...
simply
a
different
procedure,
where
we
authorize
the
district--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
i
think
that
the
order
runs
to
not
just
the
particular
levy
that
the
court
had
ordered,
but
indeed,
the
order
to
set
levies
in
the
future,
so
i...
i
would
think
all
of
them--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
believe
that
both
questions
are
before
you,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
is
the
district
court
following--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--it
will.
what
the
parties
by
agreement,
your
honor,
said
for
this
particular
tax
year,
we
would
not
go
through
that
particular
process
because
the
case
was
pending
in
this
court,
but
there's
certainly
no
question,
i
think,
that
the
district
court
intends
to
follow
that.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
question
is...
if
i
understand
it...
how
would
it
achieve
it
in
the
absence
of
the
tax?
now,
i
think
there
are
two
questions
there.
first
of
all,
if
you
simply
isolate
the
funding,
and
as
i
will
say,
we
don't
think
that's
the
correct
thing
to
do,
but
if
you
simply
isolate
the
funding,
then
we
think
the
court
should
have
addressed
the
question
of
whether
it
would
have
been
less
intrusive,
as
we
believe
it
is,
to
simply
put
all
of
the
funding
responsibility
on
the
defendants
jointly.
we
think,
although
that
obviously
does
have
an
effect
on
the
state,
that
that
is
a
less
intrusive
use
of
judicial
power.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
there
is
some
dispute
about
that
in
the
lower
court,
but
some
of
the
orders
clearly
read
that
way,
your
honor,
yes,
they
do.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
we
think
that
would
have
been
a
less
intrusive
form
of
financing
if
the
question
came
to
that.
now,
i
want
to
make
clear,
our
position
here
is
that
that
is
not
the
only
alternative
that
the
court--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that
is
one
alternative,
that's
correct.
we
believe
there
is
another
alternative,
however;
the
court,
if
it
was
going
to
increase
the
burden
of
the
state,
should
have
examined
whether
it
was
possible
to
reach
the
constitutional
goal
by
means
that
didn't
put
such
an
enormous
burden.
but...
so
i
think
both
of
those
should
be
considered.
but
we
do
think
one
of
them
would
be
the
possibility
of
saying
that
the
state,
as
the
sovereign
body,
would
be
responsible
for
seeing
that
the
financing
was
obtained.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that
there
is
simply...
the
record
will
stand
on
its
own,
that
there
is
no
adequate
discussion
by
the
court
of
looking
at
and
rejecting
the
various
alternatives
that
we
are
talking
about.
i
mean--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--what
we
are...
essentially,
what
we
are
talking
about
is
both,
your
honor.
because
i
don't
think
that
they
can
be
taken,
one
from
the
other,
at
least
in
our
view
of
how
the
court
ought
to
exercise
power.
what
we
think
should
happen
is
that
a
court,
in...
in
putting
together
remedies,
must
be
aware,
from
the
beginning,
of
the
particular
financing
concerns
that
are
being
caused
by
the
remedy.
and
if
you
look
just
very
briefly
at
the
history
here,
from
the
very
first
order,
remedial
order,
in
june
of
1985,
the
court
indicated
that
the
school
district
was
going
to
have
difficulty
raising
really
any
significant
funding
to
contribute
to
the
remedy.
the
very
next
year,
however,
the
court,
with
only
the
very
briefest
conclusory
discussion
of
cost,
adopted,
at
the
urging
of
the
school
district
itself,
an
experimental
remedial
program,
which
went
well
beyond
any
remedial
program
ever
ordered
in
a
school
desegregation
case.
ten
months
after
that,
when
the
school
district
had
come
back
in,
in
the
meantime,
and
said,
we
don't
have
the
funding
for
that
order,
the
court
issued
another
unprecedented
order
in
a
facilities...
you
know,
on
facilities
programming,
to...
to
impose
another
hundred
of
millions
of
dollars
in...
in
liability
on
the
defendants,
again,
with
only
the
briefest
discussion
of
the
cost.
xxx--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
think
that
is
the
process.
we're...
we're
not
saying
that...
that
there's
a
specific
result
that
we're
asking
for
here.
obviously,
that
is
something
that
the
court
would
be
required
to
determine
itself.
but
in
terms
of
the
process,
we
believe
that
that
is
something
that,
in
exercising
equitable
powers,
and...
and
let
me
stress
again,
i'm
assuming
at
the
moment
we're...
that
there
is
an...
a
power
to
tax
somewhere
at
the
end
of
this,
but
before
exercising
any
equitable
powers
that
put
these
unusual
burdens
on,
the
court
should
engage
in
just
that
sort
of
analysis,
and
make
proper
findings.
and--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--your
honor,
we
did.
we
made
suggestions
at...
at
every
stage.
now,
the
court
didn't
accept--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--we
did
not
say
that,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--what
we
are
saying
is
that
we
believe
that
is
an
alternative
that
is
preferable
to
ordering
the
tax.
and
that
in
terms
of
looking
at
how
judicial
power
is
exercised,
that
that
would
be
less
intrusive
than
the
order
to
tax,
even
assuming
that
the
power
to
tax
exists
at
all.
but--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
well,
your
honor,
what
we
have
said,
and
what
we,
in
fact,
are
saying
here
is
that
we
think
that
should
be
considered
in
conjunction
with
a
look
at
the
remedy
itself,
to
determine
whether
all
of
the
funds
are
needed.
that
that
is
the
full
exercise
of
equitable
power
that
we
are
asking
the
court
to
examine.
we
are
not
even
here
suggesting
that
the
proper
result
is
simply
to
say,
let's
ignore
whether
these
costs
are
absolutely
necessary
or
ignore
the
burdens
they
may
put
on
a
particular
defendant,
just
let's
shift
the
money
around.
that's
not
our
position
in
this
court,
and
that
was
not
our
position
in
the
courts
below.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--it's
only
against
the
best
interests
of
the
client
if
two
assumptions
are
made.
first
of
all,
that
the
court
will
not
consider
in
exercise...
the
issue
of
exercise
of
power
as
to
how
it
properly
should
be
determined--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
your
honor,
let
me
say...
and
i'll
come
back
to
it,
that
i...
that
i
think
that
what
i'm
talking
about
is
fairly
encompassed
within
the
question
the
court
did
grant,
but
the
other
assumption,
of
course,
that
has
to
be
made
is
that
the
only
interest
of
the
state
is
the
financial
one.
and
i
think
that's
not
true.
that
there
is
a
question
here
both
of
the
sort
of
sovereignty
of
the
state
and
its
state
laws,
and
essentially
the
commission
that
the
state
has
from
its
people.
and
i
think
that
is
the
thing
that
is
so
troubling
about
an
order
that
involves
the
power
to
tax
is
that,
in
this
particular
case,
what
it
says
to
the
state
is...
or
says
to
the
school
district...
you
have
authority
now
from
the
court
itself
to
levy
a
tax
that
the
citizens
have
not
given
you
authority
to
levy...
in
fact,
it
specifically
denied
you
the
authority
to
levy.
and
the
idea
of
taxation
without
representation,
which
is
of
course
a
catchy
slogan,
but
i
think
it's
something
more
than
that,
too.
i
think
it's
rooted
in
the
idea
that
the
power
to
take
property
from
citizens...
the
government's
power
to
take
that
property
is...
is
exercised
through
elected
representatives
and
not
through
courts,
unless
there
is
individual
adjudications,
which
of
course
we
don't
have
here.
so,
the...
that
is
the
principle
that
the
state
does
believe
is
one
that
is...
is
worth
preserving
and
that
its
laws
simply
shouldn't
be
set
aside
because
the
court
feels
that
that
would
be
a
more
convenient
way
of
achieving
its
goal.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
your
honor,
the...
the--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well,
i've...
i've
jumped
around,
and
let
me
make
clear
that
there
are
two
different
points
that
i'm
urging.
the
first
is
that
there
is
no
power
to
tax,
period.
that
federal
courts
simply
don't
have
the
power
to
say
to
a
legislative
body
or
a
school
district,
whatever,
the
people
have
not
given
you
this
authority,
but
i,
as
a
federal
judge...
[inaudible]--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that
ultimately
would--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--that
ultimately
would
be
the
burden
of
our
position,
although,
i
would
point
out,
of
course,
that
in
desegregation
litigation,
that
has
not
proved
generally
necessary.
the
courts
have
been
able
to
find
remedies
that
will
work
and
be
effective
without
a
tax.
but
logically
that's...
that
is
the
ultimate
extent.
but
that
is
of
course
the
logical
point
that
one
gets
to
any
time
one
puts
any
limits
on
judicial
power.
one
can
always
look
at
a...
the
particular
exercise
of
power
and
say,
if
there
weren't
limits
on
these
powers,
we
could
quash
the
subpoena
that
the
house
subcommittee
has
issued,
for
example,
which
may
infringe
somebody's
rights.
that
is...
so
that
is
why
you
only
obviously
limit
judicial
power
when
the
institutional
considerations
are
of
extreme
importance.
but
we
think
they
are
of
extreme
importance
in
this
particular
case.
so
that's
the
first
point
that
we
are
making,
that
that
power
simply
does
not
exist
in
federal
courts,
even,
as
you
posit,
in
the
most
extreme
case.
the
second
question,
though,
the
second
point
we
are
putting,
is
that
as
an
exercise
of
power,
of
equity
and
comity,
that
this
is
not
the
extreme
case.
if
anything,
it's
the
extreme
case
the
other
way,
that
the
court
essentially
put
itself
into
this
whole
and
then
said,
having
gotten
into
it,
that
there
were
only
two
ways
to
extricate
itself,
the
tax
and
perhaps
levying
it
all
on
the
state.
and
we
don't
believe
that
that
process
should
be
looked
at
once
the
hole
is
dug.
now
i
would
say
one...
one
more
word
about
power.
i
have
made
the
point,
i
think,
that
the
power,
in
and
of
itself,
is
an
extraordinary
power,
but
i
think
it
can't
just
be
viewed
in
isolation.
i
think
the
other
thing
that
this
claim
of
power
does
is
it
concentrates,
in
the
federal
court,
a
range
of
powers
that
are
really
quite
extraordinary,
beginning
with
the
power
to
declare
what
the
constitution
means...
the
power,
of
course,
that
everybody
concedes...
to
the
power
to
issue
orders
for
particular
programs,
orders
than
require
state
and
local
officials
or
federal
officials,
in
some
cases,
to
comply
and
implement
those
programs,
and
ultimately,
now,
the
ability
of
the
courts
to
try
to
go
out
and
get
the
citizens
to
support
these
programs
beyond
the
power
that
they
have
already
given
to
their
elected
representatives.
that
is
a
concentration,
i
believe,
that
is
well
beyond
the
idea
of
judicial
power
that
is
embodied
in
article
three,
which
anticipated
that
courts
obviously
would
have
important
power,
but
that
power
would
be
distributed,
not
just
among
the
courts
themselves,
but
among
and...
and
between
other
branches
of
government.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
that...
i
am
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that
question,
justice
white.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i
think
that
it
involves
some
of
the...
the
precise
concerns
that
i'm
talking
about.
it's
still
ultimately--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--well--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
think
that
is
basically
the
position
that
i
would
take.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
let
me
at
least
explain
what
i
see
as
the
difference
between
the
two.
at
least
in
that
case,
the
citizens
have
authorized
the
legislature,
or
the
school
district,
to
impose
those
taxes
on
them.
they
have
gone
that
far.
now
i
think
the
place
where
i
have
trouble
with
that
exercise
of
judicial
power
is
i
think
that
people
did
that
on
the
expectation
that
the
legislature
would,
in
fact,
do
it
in
its
own
judgment.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
i...
i
would
think
that's
beyond
the
power
of
the
court.
if...
if
it
is
unconstitutional--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--if
it
is
unconstitutional
in
and
of
itself,
of
course,
if--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--i
think
you
can
declare
that
unconstitutional.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
but
i
don't
think...
justice
white,
i
don't
think
you
can
simply
lump
all
limitations
together.
that's
the
thing.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
effect
of
what
the
court
is
doing.
virtually
any
order
could
be
characterized
in
some
way
as
simply
striking
down
a
particular
limiting
power.
if
that
was
true,
then...
then
judicial
power
would
essentially
be
unlimited.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
effect
of
the
order
is.
and
if
the
effect
of
the
order
is
to
say,
we're
striking
down
a
limitation
on
the
power
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
to
obtain
money
from
the
people,
that,
in
fact,
is
a
tax
levied
under
the
authority
of
the
courts.
whether
it's
characterized
that
way
or
not,
that's
what
it
is.
and
that's
what
we
think
the
courts
can't
do.
your
honor,
if
i
could,
i'd
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
couple
of
brief
points.
returning
momentarily
to
the
jurisdictional
question,
the
respondents
take
the
position
i
think,
as
i
understand
it
now,
that
what
this
court
ought
to
do
is
review
the
particular
papers
that
were
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
rather
than
taking
the
court
of
appeal's
order
at
face
value.
we
don't
think
that
is
in
fact
a
rule
that
is
likely
to
lead
to
a
great
deal
of
certainty
and
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
entitled
to
treat
the
papers
before
it
as
a
rehearing
petition
if
it
wishes
to
do
so.
as
we
have
pointed
out
several
times,
several
circuits
do.
the
difference
between
a
case
like
this
and--
mr.
h.
bartow
farr,
iii
--but
justice
scalia,
there's
no
such
absolute
certainty
in
any
event.
i
mean,
because
everybody
agrees,
i
believe
that
the
court
can
treat
it
as
a
petition
for
rehearing
if
it
wants.
it
could
grant
it
as
a
petition
for
rehearing,
it
could
modify
its
opinion,
all
sorts
of
things
could
go
on,
and
i
think
to
allow
the
courts
that
sort
of
flexibility
as
part
of
their
own
operating
procedures
simply
makes
sense
even
though
there
might
be
some
less
certainty
on
the
front
end
as
to
what
the
particular
litigant
expects.
the
difference
between
this
and
the
credit
company
case
i
think
is
that
a
court
of
appeals
can
and
should
have
the
power
to
do
that.
what
a
court
of
appeals
can't
do
is,
it
can't
treat
june
15th
as
if
it
were
june
1st.
that's
just
something
that's
wholly
outside
the
ambit
of
the
power
of
a
court
of
appeals
and
therefore
that
purely...
that
effort
to
convey
jurisdiction
by
taking
an
action
like
that
is
literally
outside
its
power.
the
second
point,
briefly,
on
the
question
of
the
position
below,
just
so
it
is
understood,
the
state's
position
has
always
been
opposed
to
a
tax.
the
school
district,
despite
what
it
is
saying
right
now,
has
at
various
times
throughout
the
litigation
said
that
the
school
district
should
bear
none
of
the
cost.
we
have
said
we
as
a
general
principle
are
opposed
to
that.
we
think
the
school
district
should
bear
some
of
the
cost,
and
we
think
that
the
court
should
devise
remedies
that
allows
both
of
those
principles
to
be
carried
out,
where
the
state
would
bear
a
burden,
the
school
district
would
bear
a
burden,
and
constitutional
compliance
would
be
achieved
with
both
of
them
doing
that.
the
problem,
as
we
have
said,
is
that
the
court
simply
ignored
those
considerations
in
developing
the
particular
remedy
and
essentially
made
the
kind
of
order
that
it
led
to,
or
the
alternative
of
the
state
bearing
all
of
it,
a
foregone
conclusion.
finally,
i'd
just
like
to
say...
sorry?
