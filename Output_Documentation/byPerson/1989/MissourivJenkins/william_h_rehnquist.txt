chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
88-1150,
missouri
v.
kalima
jenkins.
mr.
farr?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
farr,
we
occasionally
run
into
a
situation
here
where
a
court
of
appeals
or
a
state
court
will
enter
a
judgment
nunc
pro
tunc
where
the
petitioner
has
had
his
time
for
certiorari
expire
just
so
that
the
person
will
be
able
to
petition
in
what
they
think
is
a
timely
manner.
this
would
be
somewhat
disturbing,
i
think,
if
there
were
any
thought
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
just
kind
of
given
a
break
to
your
client.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
farr.
mr.
snyder,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say,
then,
that
unless
there's
a
rule
like
there
is
in
some
other
circuits,
a
practice
uniformly
followed
by
the
circuit
but
not
confided
to
rule,
is
not
sufficient?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but...
am
i
not
right,
mr.
snyder,
that
state
law
did
not
authorize
them
to
levy
this
sort
of
a
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
condition
to
the
exercise
of--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--of
the
taxing
power.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
citizens--
--just
a
minute.
is
there
any
suggestion
that
this
particular
limitation
was
enacted
to
frustrate
desegregation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
have
a
state
law
saying
that
students
in
school
shall
be
segregated
by
race,
it's
one
thing
to
override
that
sort
of
a
law
by
saying
that
is...
that
is
itself
unconstitutional.
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
another
thing
to
say
that
students
shall
not
be
segregated
by
race.
this
school
district
at
one
time
did
segregate
them
by
race.
we're
now
trying
to
find
a
remedy
for
that
and
get
out
into
the
area
of
how...
how
municipal
corporations
raise
money.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
snyder.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
snyder.
mr.
farr,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
farr.
the
case
is
submitted.
