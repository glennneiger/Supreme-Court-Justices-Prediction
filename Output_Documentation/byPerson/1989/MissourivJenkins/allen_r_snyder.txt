mr.
allen
r.
snyder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
this
court
finds
that
it
has
jurisdiction
in
this
case,
and
we
believe
there
is
a
very
serious
question
on
that
which
i
would
like
to
address
first,
but
the
fundamental
issue
on
the
merits
of
the
case
is
whether
the
court
below
properly
exercised
its
power,
its
discretion
and,
we
believe,
its
responsibility
to
ensure
the
implementation
and
the
funding
of
the
remedy
determined
by
the
court
to
be
necessary
to
correct
a
clearly
proven
constitutional
violation.
now,
turning
first
to
the
jurisdictional
issue,
we
think
that
the
clerk
of
this
court
was
correct
in
his
initial
determination
that
the
90-day
statutory
time
limit
for
filing
petitions
for
writ
of
certiorari
had
run
before
any
petition
was
filed
and,
thus,
that
there
was
a
jurisdictional
bar
from
this
court
considering
the
case.
the
state
now
relies
basically
on
the
nunc
pro
tunc
order
that
was
issued
just
a
very
few
days
after
this
clerk's...
this
court's
clerk's
determination,
where
the
eighth
circuit
declared
that
it
had
denied
petitions
for
rehearing
and
petitions
for
rehearing
en
banc.
this
court,
in
the
credit
company
v.
arkansas
central
railway
case,
stated
clearly
that
jurisdiction
in
this
court
cannot
be
created
by
an
order
of
a
lower
court
or
by
a
nunc
pro
tunc
determination.
the
fact
is,
the
very
plain
fact
is
that
the
state
did
not
file
a
petition
for
rehearing
below.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
it
obviously
would
be
a
more
difficult
case
for
us.
but
i
would
suggest
that
the
language
of
this
court's
rule
20.4
makes
this
jurisdictional
question
turn
not
on
what
a
lower
court
characterizes
but,
rather,
the
language
of
the
rule
says
that
the
timely
filing
of
a
petition
for
rehearing
tolls
the...
the
time
for
review.
if
the
state
had
filed
a
timely
petition
for
rehearing
regardless
of
how
it
was
characterized,
we
would
concede
that
the
time...
the
time
would
be
tolled
even...
even
regardless
of
the
phrasing
of
the
eighth
circuit's
rule.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
justice
scalia--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--justice
scalia,
we
agree
that
a
circuit
court
can
do
that
and
is
certainly
free
to
treat
the
petitions
in
any
way
it
wishes.
first
of
all,
i
think
there
is
a
serious
question
whether
in
that
way
it
can
extend
this
court's
jurisdiction
when
the
rule
of
this
court
talks
in
terms
of
whether
the
parties
have
filed
a
timely
petition
for
rehearing.
but
we
really
do
not
need
to
reach
that
question
here,
because,
first
of
all,
the
eighth
circuit
did
not...
does
not
have
such
a
rule,
as
other
circuits
do.
second
of
all,
the...
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion,
even
its
nunc
pro
tunc
opinion,
contrary
to
the
suggestion
of
counsel,
the
nunc
pro
tunc
opinion
did
not
say
we
have
elected
to
treat
this
petition
as
if
it
were
a
petition
for
rehearing
by
the
panel.
it
simply
said
we
have
in
front
of
us
a
petition
for
rehearing.
we
have
copied
verbatim
at
page
489
of
the
joint
appendix
the
entire
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
that
was
filed
by
the
state.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
that
is
not
only
entitled
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
but,
as
counsel
has
essentially
acknowledged
this
morning,
it
was
in...
in
form
and
in
substance
in
every
other
way
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
which
is
actually
the
title
used
by
the
eighth
circuit
in
its
rules
to
describe
an
en
banc
petition.
some--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--circuits
refer
to
them
as
suggestions.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--justice
scalia,
i
do
not
suggest
that;
however,
i
do
suggest
that,
first
of
all,
the
failure
of
the
mandate
to
issue
does
not,
in
our
view,
indicate
that
the
court
was
treating
this
as
a
petition
for
rehearing.
in
fact,
we
cited
the
united
states
v.
samuels
case
as
an
example
of
a
case
where
the
eighth
circuit
has
held
up
a
mandate
because
a
judge
was
considering
en
banc
treatment.
and
so
the
circuit
courts
have
the
power
to
hold
the
mandate
whether
or
not
a
rehearing
petition
has
been
filed.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
justice
kennedy,
yes.
i
think
they
can
amend
the
panel
opinion
sua
sponte
or
based
on
a
petition,
and
a
new
panel
opinion
would
be
a
new
judgment.
and
under
the
language
of
the
statute
and
of
this
court's
rules,
a
new
judgment
provides
90
days
for
a
new
cert
petition.
however,
if
a
party
is
relying
on
the
timely
filing
of
a
petition
for
rehearing
to
toll
the
time
and
the
judgment
hasn't
been
changed,
there's
no
new
judgment,
we
submit
that
the
issue
is
whether
a
petition
for
rehearing
was
filed;
and
just
as
in
the
credit
company
v.
arkansas
central
railway
case,
i
believe
the
fact
is
that
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion
does
not
accurately
describe
what's
at
page
489
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
i
think
that
the
state
has
in
essence
acknowledged
that
they
did
not
file
what
they
intended
to
be
a
petition
for
rehearing
by
the
panel.
now
the
question
of
whether
the
eighth
circuit
has
a
pattern
and
a
practice
and
a
regular
custom
of
so
treating
it
that
might
have
lulled
a
party
into
filing
something
different
or
thinking
as
if
there
were
a
local
rule
that
this
would
be
treated
differently,
the
state
in
its
main
brief
cited
as
its
principal
support
for
the
proposition
that
the
eighth
circuit
has
a
regular
practice
the
mcdonnell
douglas
case
and
said
that
that
and
other
cases
suggest
this
is
how
the
eighth
circuit
treats
all
of
these
matters.
we
responded
in
our
brief
by
citing
two
published
decisions
that
we
found,
and
most
of
these
rulings
on
en
banc
petitions,
i
believe,
are
unpublished.
but
we
found
two
published
decisions
from
1985
where
en
banc
petitions
were
denied
and
were
labeled
en
banc
petitions
without
any
suggestion
that
they
were
treated
or
otherwise
denominated
as
panel
rehearing
decisions.
in
its
reply
brief,
the
state
has
come
back
in
footnote
2
and
says,
1985.
well,
there
are
two
problems,
we
would
submit,
with
this
argument.
first
is
that
the
mcdonnell
douglas
case
on
which
they
initially
relied
was
a
1973
decision,
and
so
we
are
surprised
now
to
hear
that
the
practice
is
allegedly
more
recent.
but
more
fundamentally,
we
do
not
believe
that
this
court's
jurisdiction
can
or
should
rest
on
what
counsel
may
or
may
not
be
advised
by
unknown
persons
and
unknown
details.
there
is
nothing
in
the
eighth
circuit's
rules
or
its
internal
operating
procedures
or
any
of
its
opinions
that
suggest
that
this
is
a
standard
practice.
we,
frankly,
do
not
know
whether
this
is
a
practice
that
is
more
commonly
used
than
not,
or
less
commonly.
we
just
don't
know.
and
i
believe
that
this
court
should
not
have
a
policy
of
allowing
jurisdiction
by
anecdote.
i
think
the
jurisdictional
rules
should
be
clearly
written
and
should
be
interpreted
and
implemented
in
a
way
that
the
parties
and
the
lower
courts
can
know
what
they
mean
and
can
be
governed
accordingly.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
i
believe
it
would
not
be
sufficient,
mr.
chief
justice,
particularly
because
this
court
i
think
is
not
in
a
good
position
to
engage
in
evidentiary
hearings
or
proceedings
to
try
to
determine
what
the
practices
might
be.
the
best
evidence
of
such
a
practice
if
a
circuit
court
wishes
to
adopt
it
is
to
put
it
in
the
rules,
which
would
allow
the
parties
to
know
when
their
time
was
running
and
when
it
wasn't;
and
not
only
the
parties
filing
the
petition
but,
hopefully,
the
parties
who
might
be
opposing
the
petition
would
like
to
know
when
the
case
is
final.
now
turning,
if
i
may,
to
the...
the
merits
of
the
argument
here,
the
state's
position
comes
down
basically
to
the
bald
suggestion
that
in
at
least
some
cases
the
federal
courts
simply
lack
the
power
to
ensure
that
constitutionally-required
remedies
are
implemented
and
funded.
we
believe
that
that
position
is
without
any
precedent
in
this
court's
jurisprudence
and
is
dangerously
wrong.
counsel
referred
to
marbury
v.
madison,
which
was
in
fact
cited
below,
and
one
can
go
back
as
far
as
marbury
v.
madison
and
find
where
chief
justice
marshall,
at
page
163
of
that
decision,
said,
and
i
quote,
"the
government
of
the
united
states
has
been
emphatically
termed
a
government
of
laws
and
not
of
men.
"
"it
would
cease
to
deserve
this
high
accolation
if
the
laws
failed
to
furnish
a
remedy
for
a
clearly
vested...
for
the
violation
of
a
clearly
vested
legal
right.
"
i
think
since
marbury
v.
madison,
it's
been
understood
that
the
federal
courts,
once
they
accept
jurisdiction
of
a
case
and
have
the
power
to
hear
the
case
and
find
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
have
the
power
and
have
the
duty
to
use
their
equitable
discretion
to
find
and
to
be
sure
that
it
is
implemented,
a
remedy
for
that
violation.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
justice
scalia,
i
think...
i
think
that
is
the...
the
implication
of
my
position.
i
think
the
argument
is
stronger
in
the
context
of
the
kind
of
violation
we
have
here,
but
i
agree
under
the
supremacy
clause
there
should
be
a
remedy
for
any
violation
of
federal
law.
we
would
acknowledge
that
in
exercising
the
lower
court's
discretion
and
power,
they
should
look
to
questions
and
issues
of
comity
and
of
federalism
and
equitable
principles.
we
agree
that
those
should
be
considered
in
fashioning
the
appropriate
remedies.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
no.
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
would
be
an
inappropriate
use
of
the
court's
discretion--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
think
as
a
matter
of
pure
power--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--the
court
is
required
to
find
the
appropriate
constitutional
remedy.
now
there
may
be
a...
there
may
be
a
possibility
such
as
the
one
you
posit,
justice
scalia,
where
a
particular
remedy
or
maybe
even
the
only
remedy
would
be
unworkable
or
beyond
any
realistic
limits.
in
lemon
v.
kurtzman,
which
the
state
cites,
and
in
some
of
the
cases
we
cite--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--if
it
is...
yes,
if
it
is
practicable.
now
i
do
think
the
questions
of
practicability,
the
courts...
this
court
and...
and
the
courts
low...
lower
courts,
have
talked
about
equitable
discretion
being
limited
by
principles
of
workability,
practicability,
feasibility,
and
i
submit
that
the
hypothetical
that's
been
suggested
of
raising
an
army
is
not
a
feasible,
practical,
workable
solution.
but
i
believe
the
courts
have
the
power
to
find,
if
it
is
at
all
possible,
a
feasible
and
practical
remedy
for
constitutional--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
would
hope
that
the...
the
legislative
and
executive
branches
would
cooperate
with--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--well,
in
this
case,
turning
to
whether
here
there
was
any
other
remedy,
it
is
absolutely
true
that
in
the
courts
below
there
were
two
possible
remedies...
two
possible
approaches
to
funding
this
remedy
that
were
considered.
the
state
has
acknowledged
that.
the
lower
courts
refer
to
it.
one
possibility
was
to
enjoin
the
provisions
of
the
state
law
that
otherwise
prevented
the
school
board
from
exercising
the
taxing
power
that
it
has.
that
was
one
option,
and
that's
what
the
eighth
circuit
did.
it
did
not
directly
levy
a
tax
of
its
own.
it
enjoined
a
state
law
which
prevented
the
local
government
from
acting
to...
to
meet
the
constitutional
duty.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
the
district
court--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--yes,
i
agree
that
the
district
court,
the
way
it
phrased
its
order,
it
phrased
it
as
implementing
the
tax
order.
the
eighth
circuit
on
review--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--the
district
court
order
was
initially
implemented
prior
to
the
eighth
circuit's
ruling.
the
eighth
circuit
on
review...
and
it's
the
eighth
circuit's
judgment,
i
would
submit,
that's
here
before
this
court
for
review...
the
eighth
circuit
modified
the
district
court's
ruling
to
the
extent
that
it
said
that
the
appropriate
way
to
deal
with
this
problem
rather
than
directly
calling
for
the
tax
was
to
enjoin
the
state
law
that
prevented
the
board
from
doing
it.
it
is
that
order--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--the
levy
had
been
in
place
prior
to
the
eighth
circuit's
ruling,
and
the
eighth
circuit
did
not
try
to
apply
its
ruling
retroactively,
keeping
in
mind
that
the
practical
effect
of
the
eighth
circuit's
ruling
was
to...
likely
still
to
allow
for
a
tax.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
yes,
it
did
leave
the
levy
in
place
that--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--yes,
justice
white.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
for
the
future
as
of
the
day
of
that
opinion.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
they
affirmed
the
levy
that
had
been
in
place
up
to
the
date
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--which
had
been
about
one
year.
and
then--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--that
is
the
second
option
to
which
i
was
referring.
it
was
considered
by
the
lower
court,
and
we
believe
it
is
inappropriate
at
this
stage
for
the
state
to
be
totally
switching
its
position
on
that
issue
because
in
the
district
court
when
a
motion
was
filed
that
raised
the
question
of
which
of
these
options
should
be
pursued,
the
state...
and
we've
included
this
in
the
joint
appendix
in
toto...
the
state
filed
pleadings
that
said
that
they
recognized
that
under
some
circumstances
the
lower
courts
might
have
the
authority
to
order
a
school
district
to
implement
a
tax,
or
to
be
allowed
to
implement
a
tax,
and
that
the
state
wasn't
really
taking
a
position
in
the
district
court
on
whether
this
was
an
appropriate
case.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
no--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--no,
justice
o'connor.
in
the
circumstances
here,
we
think
the
district
court
acted
properly
because
we
think
that
the
principles
of
comity
and
federalism
and
equitable
discretion
require
the
district
judge
to
look
at
the
circumstances
before
him
which
included
the
positions
of
the
parties.
comity
and
federalism
call
for
the
courts...
they
are
not
bars
to
the
power
of
a
court.
they
are
practical
and
equitable
considerations
that
a
court
should
weigh,
and
they
call
upon
the
court
particularly
to
look
at
the
interests
of
the
governmental
defendants
here--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--oh,
i
certainly
agree,
justice
o'connor,
there's
a
difference,
and
if
the
parties
positions
had
been
different
below,
i
think
the
equitable
balance
and
the
comity
issues
might
have
come
out
differently.
the
fact
is
that
the
elected
school
board
felt
that
it
was
appropriate
for
the
citizens
of
kansas
city
to
pay
a
portion
of
the
remedy
here.
the
state--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--that's
basically
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
did
authorize
exactly
this
kind
of
a
tax
except
that
it
had
a
limitation
that
it
required
a
vote
of
the
citizens
of
the
district
after
the
vote
by
the
representatives.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
absolutely.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
absolutely.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
no,
mr.
chief
justice.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
suggest
that.
we
do
believe,
however,
that
cases
like
north
carolina
v.
swann
and
other
cases
from
this
court
suggest
that
if
a
state
law
has
the
effect
of
preventing
the
implementation
of
a
constitutionally
required
remedy,
to
that
extent,
the
state
law
can
be
overridden.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
believe
this
court's
cases
limit
the
statutes
that
can
be
stricken
where
they
interfere
with
the
implementation
of
a
remedy
to
those
that
are
an
independent
constitutional
violation,
and
i
would
cite,
for
example,
washington
versus
fishing
vessel
association
which
we
cited
in
our
brief,
where
perfectly
neutral
state
law
provisions
had
the
effect
in
that
case
of
preventing
the
implementation
of
the
remedy
the
court
had
already
ordered
was
the
right
remedy.
and
this
court
said
that
even
seemingly
neutral
state
laws,
if
they
have
the
practical
effect
of
stopping
implementation
of
a
constitutionally
required
remedy,
can
be
overridden.
in
this
case,
the
state
in
the
district
court
said
that
the
one
issue
it
cared
the
most
about
with
regard
to
the
funding
was
that
the
state
felt
it
was
wholly
inappropriate
for
the
state
to
pay
any
more
money
than
it
had
already
been
ordered
to
pay,
and
it
objected
to
joint
and
several
liability
or
any
other
basis
for
the
state
to
pay
part
of
the
costs
that
otherwise
the
district
would
have
to
bear.
the
district
court,
exercising
his
discretion
in
looking
at
principles
of
comity,
saw
that
both
governmental
defendants,
in
essence,
were
agreed
in
saying
that
an
order
that
allowed
the
school
district
to
pay
its
share
of
the
remedy
allowed
the
citizens
of
the
district
to
contribute
when
it
had
been
found
guilty
of
a
constitutional
violation
as
well,
that
that
was
the
most
appropriate
remedy
where
both...
all
the
parties
agreed
that
that
was
preferable
to
what
the
state
now
is
saying
should
have
been
done
below.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
yes.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
it
is
an
unusual
remedy,
justice.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
yes,
i
think
that's
a
reasonable
requirement,
and
it
was
met
then.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
it
was
met
here.
i
think
if
you
read
the
opinions
below,
each
of
the
remedial
orders
made
explicit
findings
that
this
remedial
decree
was,
"necessary"
to
cure
the
specific
constitutional
violations
that
were
found,
citing
this
court's
milliken
versus
bradley,
the
need
to
tailor
the
remedy
to
the
violation.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
it
does.
it
does,
i
believe,
place
us
in
a
position
where
we
have
a
final
determination
that
the
lower
courts
appropriately
tailored
this
remedy
to
the
violations
found,
and
we
think
they
did.
what...
they
cited
the
appropriate
legal
standards,
milliken
versus
bradley
and
other
cases,
in
each
of
those
cases.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
the
word
that
was
used
repeatedly
by
the
lower
court
is
not
essential.
i
believe
the
word
was
necessary,
but
i
think
it
means
basically
the
same
thing.
and
the
lower
court,
starting
in
1985,
repeatedly
recognized
that
it
would
be
expensive
to
fund
the
remedy
that
was
needed
for
the
very
serious
constitutional
violations
here.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
i
think
in
the
context
that
the
district
court
used
the
word
necessary,
after
citing
milliken
versus
bradley,
and
finding
that
each
of
the
provisions
here
was
necessary
to
cure
the
constitutional
violations,
i
believe
the
context
suggests
he
was
trying
essentially
to
say
that
he
found
it
essential.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
i
do,
and
i
recognize
that
this
court,
not
having
in
front
of
it
the
full
record...
after
cert
was
denied,
we've
not
transmitted
all
as
part
of
the
record
here
everything
that
went
into
those
remedial
determinations,
and
we
have
not
briefed
that
issue,
but
i
do
believe
that
the
record
shows
that
the
constitutional
violations
here
were
particularly
pernicious
and,
in
fact,
resulted
in
the
kansas
city
school
district
becoming
a
74
percent
minority
district
because
of
the
actions
of
the
state
and
at
an
earlier
stage
the,
the
local
officials,
and
that
the
only
way
to
reverse
what
had
occurred
on
this
record
was
to
try
to
make
the...
to
bring
the
quality
of
the
schools
up
to
where
they
would
have
been
but
for
the
violation
and
to
try
to
attract
back
into
the
schools
the
people
who
were
driven
out
of
them.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
obviously
i
find
that
hypothetical
difficult
to
accept,
but
accepting
that
hypothetical--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
would
say,
justice
scalia,
that
the
principle
that
i
suggested
earlier
of
feasibility
and
practicability
and
workability
should
be
the
limit
on
the
court's
discretion.
it
would
not,
i
submit,
be
feasible
or
practicable
to
gold
plate
all
the
schools.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
however,
we
think
it
is
feasible
to
do
what
the
court
below
did,
which
is
to
demand
that
these
schools
be
brought
up
to
the
level
comparable
to
other
schools
in
the
area
so
as
to
attract
back
in
the
students
who
left
when
the
facilities
were,
"literally
rotting"
as
was
found
below.
there
were
holes
in
the
roofs.
the
buildings
were
rotting
down,
and
water
was
pouring
in,
because
the
local
and
state
authorities
had
stopped
funding
the
schools.
this
is
really--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
think
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
i
was
trying
to
respond
to
the
question
of
really
whether
the
state
is
right
in
suggesting
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
scope
of
the
remedy
together
with
the
funding
order.
i
think
that
it
is
appropriate
at
this
stage
of
the
proceeding
to
accept
the
remedy
which
was
found
to
be
necessary,
following
the
right
precedents--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--well,
i
think
this
court
frequently
will
consider
abstract
or
legal
questions
and
will
leave
the
factual
determinations
to
the
lower
courts.
i
assume,
perhaps
presumptuously,
but
i
assume
when
this
court
denied
cert
on
question
one,
it
felt
that
there
was
not
a
legal
question
worthy
of
review
on
question
one,
but
felt
that
the
issue
raised
by
question
two
raised
a
legal
question
for
review.
i
think
they
can
be
separated.
in
conclusion,
we
really
come
back
to
the
proposition
with
which
we
started,
and
that
is
that
violations
of
constitutional
rights
we
believe
require
the
federal
courts
to
use
their
discretion
looking
at
principles
of
comity
and
federalism,
looking
at
the
practical
circumstances
of--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--a
small
difference,
justice
white.
i
think
the
practical--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
think
that
the...
the
district
court's
decision
is
not
quite
as
easy
to
articulate
the
defense
of
as
the
eighth
circuit
decision.
i
think
they're
both
proper.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
i
do
not
believe
it
is,
justice
white.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
what
i
mean
to
say
is,
i
think
it's
not
before
you
because
the
eighth
circuit
in
modifying
the
judgment...
i
think
it's
that
determination
that
this
court
should
review
and
money
was
collected
for
the
first
year--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--well,
i
think
it
was
one
year.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
i
think
technically
it
is
before
you,
but
because
the
eighth
circuit
modified
the
judgment
and
really
recharacterized
what
was
done
for
the
future,
i
don't
believe
that
there's
any
violation.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
yes,
sir,
it
was
although
there
was
some
that
was
paid
under
protest
that
remains
awaiting
this
court's
decision.
