the
eighth
circuit
has
no
rule
to
that
effect,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
there
anything
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc
that
indicated
that
it
was
intended
to
serve
both
purposes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
it's
a
petition
for
rehearing
by
the
panel.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
what
it
means.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
practice
of
this
court,
i
assume,
is
to
treat
both
a
suggestion
for
rehearing,
or
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc,
as
not
tolling
the
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
that
was
by
a
nunc
pro
tunc
order
which
perhaps
it
didn't
have
any
authority
to
enter.
i
mean,
if
there
wasn't
any
jurisdiction
they
can't
come
in
later
and
create
it
by
that
kind
of
an
order.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
when
it
comes
here,
we
have
to
determine
whether
the
petition
to
us
was
timely
or
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
talking
about
the
future
or
the
one
year,
'91-'92?
i
thought
there
was
some
difference
in
the
order
for
the
future
and
for
the
one
year?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
not
have
at
issue
the
levy
for
'91-'92?
that's
not--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
levy
for
'91-'92
is
not
before
us,
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
we
have
both
questions
before
us,
or
do
we
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
for
at
least
for
one
year,
the...
the
court
below
ordered
the
tax--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
go
into
effect--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
for
the
future
authorized
the
board
to
levy
the
increased
tax?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
alternative
did
the
court
below
have?
how
was
it
going
to
achieve
what
it
had
determined
had
to
be
achieved
in
the
absence
of
the
money?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
they...
are
the
state
and
the
school
district
jointly
and
severally
liable
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
assume
they
are
jointly
and
severally
liable,
what
could
the
court
have
done,
just
order
the
state
to
pay
it
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
is
one
alternative?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
farr,
your
argument
makes
it
sound
like
what
you're
saying
is
there's
no
power
to
tax
because
it's
too
expensive...
this
program
is
too
expensive.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
what
you're
urging?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
there
is
no
other
alternative
to
remedy--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--desegregation
order?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
certainly
did
more
than
that,
at
least
for
one
year,
did
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
district
court
did
more
than
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
the
district
court
ever
implemented
that
order
to
increase
the
property
tax
levy
to
$4?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
for
the
future.
i
thought
it
left
in
place
at
least
one
or
two
years
of
levy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
the
eighth
circuit
did
not
disapprove
what
had
happened
before.
it
left
that
in
place,
which
included
a
levy
at
the
rate
of
$4?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
and
as
to
that
could
the
district
court
instead
have
ordered
the
state
to
pay
all
the
costs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
state's
change
of
position,
then
and
now,
is
not
a
very
attractive
posture,
certainly,
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
legal
question
that
we
have
to
answer.
now,
should
the
district
court
have
used
this
other
alternative
and
ordered
the
state
to
pick
up
the
entire
cost
and
thereby
not
have
had
to
impose
an
actual
tax
levy
at
the
local
level--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
violated
missouri
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
do
you
see
no
difference
in
levying
an
actual
tax
than
to
finding
other
means
of
paying
the
costs
of
such
an
order?
