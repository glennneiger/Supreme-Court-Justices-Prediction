justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what...
what
is
there
in
the
record
that
indicates
the
court
did
not
consider
those
less
intrusive
alternatives?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
when
you're
talking
about
alternatives,
are
you
talking
about
alternatives
to
the
substantive
provision
of...
provisions
of
his
order,
or
just
funding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
position
is
that
before
this...
the
district
court
can
either
order
a
tax
or
order
the
state
to
pay
for
funding,
it
must
make
a
finding
on
the
record
that
there
are
no
remedies
or
alternatives
other
than
the
ones
that
it
is
adopting
that
are
sufficient
to
meet
the
remedial
objectives
that
the
court
has
decreed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
the
circuit
court
have
had
the
authority
during
the
pendency
of
this
petition
to
amend
the
panel
opinion?
suppose
three
judges
of
the
panel
had...
had
thought
it
appropriate
or...
or
prudent
to
amend
their
opinion?
could
they
have
done
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well...
well,
notice
that...
that
in
the
little
rock
incident,
the
president
called
out
the
troops,
and
i
assume
the
president
and
congress
are
here
to
assist
the...
this
federal
court
if
it
finds
that
missouri
is
in
violation
of
the
constitution
and
the
federal
court
cannot
correct
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
then
it's
not...
so
then
it's
not
necessarily
a
case
where
there's
no
other
remedy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
counsel,
in...
in
any
event,
i
take
it
you
concede
that
this
is
a
highly
intrusive
remedy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
a
drastic
remedy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
wouldn't
it
make
sense
for
this
court
to
say
that
before
such
a
remedy
can
be
adopted,
the
district
court
must
make
an
explicit
finding
that
the
remedy
it
seeks
to
fund
in
this
way
is
the
most
reasonable
and
the
most
feasible,
and
perhaps
the
only
essential
way
to
implement
the
court's
ultimate
decree?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
we,
of
course,
don't
have
question
one
on
the
cert
petition
before
us,
and
i'm
concerned
that
that
puts
the
question
here
in
a
very
abstract
form.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
just
not
borne
out
by
the
record.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
there
is
an
explicit
finding
that
the
substantial
funding
requirements
here
are
essential
to
implementing
the
court's
ultimate
objective.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
in
mcculloch
versus
maryland,
we
said
necessary
means
appropriate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
the
abstract
way
in
which
the
question
was
presented
here,
none
of
those
arguments
are
properly
before
us.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
if
that
presents
an
abstract
question
divorced
from
the
concrete
realities
of
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
case
of
missouri
versus
jenkins
is
a
sufficient
gravity
that
it
seems
appropriate
for
me
to
read
from
portions
of
the
concurring
opinion
that
has
been
filed
today.
the
case
involves
a
school’s
dissegregation
plan
adapted
by
united
states
district
court
in
kansas
city,
missouri.
as
part
of
the
remedial
plan,
the
local
school
districts
and
the
plaintiffs
together
proposed
and
the
district
court
ordered
expensive
improvements
to
the
local
school
system.
by
the
time
of
the
order
at
issue
here,
the
cost
of
the
plan
had
risen
to
approximately
$500
million,
far
exceeding
local
budgets
or
revenues.
the
district
court
then
decided
that
it
would
fund
the
plan
by
imposing
a
property
tax
directly
on
local
citizens.
the
court
is
unanimous
in
its
holding
today
that
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
affirming
the
direct
imposition
of
taxes
by
the
district
court
must
be
reversed.
but
this
separate
opinion
is
necessary
because
the
majority
has
gone
on
in
statements
not
necessary
to
the
resolution
of
this
case.
to
approve
a
system,
whereby
the
local
school
district
would
set
the
rate
of
taxation
and
the
federal
court
would
then
allow
the
school
district
to
impose
the
tax
even
though
it
is
in
direct
violation
of
missouri
law
under
which
the
voters
retain
the
right
to
approve
tax
increases
through
direct
vote.
absent
a
change
in
state
law,
no
increase
in
property
taxes
could
take
place
in
the
school
district.
whatever
taxing
power
the
school
district
may
exercise
in
this
case
will
derive
from
the
federal
court.
the
question
therefore
is
whether
federal
courts
possess
the
power
to
tax
or
to
authorize
the
collection
of
the
tax.
i
believe
that
this
is
not
a
power
assigned
to
the
judiciary
in
our
system
of
government.
our
cases
throughout
the
history
of
this
court
and
as
recently
as
last
term
have
reaffirmed
that
taxation
is
a
power
that
judiciary
does
not
possess.
there
is
no
support
in
the
constitution
or
history
or
our
precedents
for
the
statements
to
the
contrary
in
today’s
majority
opinion.
the
confinement
of
taxation
to
the
legislative
branches
both
in
our
federal
and
state
governments
was
not
random.
it
reflected
that
our
ideal
that
the
power
of
taxation
must
be
under
control
of
those
who
are
taxed.
this
truth
animates
all
our
colonial
and
revolutionary
history.
it
is
a
founding
principle
of
our
democracy
that
there
shall
be
no
taxation
without
representation.
the
federal
judiciary
by
design
is
not
representative
or
responsive
to
the
people
in
a
political
sense.
it
is
independent.
federal
judges
do
not
depend
on
the
popular
will
for
their
office,
and
it
is
not
surprising
that
imposition
of
taxes
by
an
authority
so
insulated
from
public
communication
or
control
can
lead
to
deep
feelings
of
frustration,
powerlessness,
and
anger
on
the
part
of
tax
paying
citizens.
one
of
the
most
troubling
aspects
of
the
court’s
opinion
today
is
that
discussion
of
the
important
constitutional
issues
of
judicial
authority
to
the
tax
need
never
have
been
undertaken
to
decide
this
case.
even
where
i
am
willing
to
accept
the
court’s
proposition
that
a
federal
court
might
in
some
extreme
case
authorize
taxation,
this
case
is
not
the
one.
in
fact,
the
taxation
power
is
sought
here
on
behalf
of
the
remedial
order
unlike
any
before
seen.
instead
of
using
the
accepted
concept
of
limited
magnet
schools,
the
district
court
decided
to
turn
the
whole
district
into
a
magnet
so
that
all
high
schools,
all
middle
schools,
and
half
the
elementary
schools
in
the
district
would
be
magnet
schools
offering
special
programs.
perhaps
it
is
good
educational
policy
to
provide
a
school
district
with
items
like
those
the
district
court
required
kansas
city
citizens
to
finance
with
a
judicial
tax.
for
example,
the
2000-square-foot
planetarium,
greenhouses
and
vivariums,
a
25
acre
farm
with
an
air-conditioned
meeting
room
for
104
people,
a
model
united
nations
wired
for
language
translation,
broadcast
capable
radio
and
television
studios,
a
temperature-controlled
art
gallery,
movie
editing
and
screening
rooms,
a
3500-square-foot
dust-free
diesel
mechanics
rooms,
swimming
pools,
and
numerous
other
facilities.
but
these
items
are
part
of
legitimate
political
debate
over
educational
policy
and
spending
priorities,
not
the
constitution’s
command
of
racial
equality.
perhaps
the
school
district’s
classical
greek
theme
school
emphasizing
forensics
and
self-government
will
provide
exemplary
training
and
participatory
democracy,
but
if
today’s
dicta
become
law,
such
lessons
will
be
of
little
use
to
students
who
grow
up
to
become
tax
payers
in
the
kansas
city
municipal
school
district.
this
case
is
a
start
illustration
of
the
ever
present
question,
whether
ends
justify
means.
few
ends
are
more
important
than
enforcing
the
guarantee
of
equal
educational
opportunity
for
our
nation’s
children.
but
rules
of
taxation
that
overrides
state
political
structures
not
themselves
subject
to
any
constitutional
infirmity
raised
serious
questions
of
federal
authority.
questions
compounded
by
the
odd
posture
of
a
case
in
which
the
court
assumes
the
validity
of
the
novel
conception
of
dissegregation
remedies
we
never
before
have
approved.
the
historical
record
of
voluntary
compliance
with
the
decree
of
brown
versus
board
of
education
is
not
a
proud
chapter
in
our
constitutional
history.
and
the
judges
of
the
district
courts
and
courts
of
appeals
have
been
courageous
and
skillful
in
implementing
its
mandate.
but
courage
and
skill
must
be
exercised
with
due
regard
for
the
proper
and
historic
role
of
the
courts.
i
do
not
acknowledge
the
troubling
departures
in
today’s
majority
opinion
as
either
necessary
or
appropriate
to
insure
full
compliance
with
the
equal
protection
clause
and
as
mandate
to
eliminate
the
cause
and
effects
of
racial
discrimination
in
the
schools.
indeed,
while
this
case
happens
to
arise
in
the
compelling
context
of
school
dissegragation,
the
principles
involved
are
not
limited
to
that
context.
this
assertion
of
judicial
power
in
one
of
the
most
sensitive
policy
areas
that
involving
taxation
begins
a
process
that
over
time
could
threaten
fundamental
alteration
of
the
form
of
government
our
constitution
embodies.
james
maddison
observed:
"justice
is
the
end
of
government.
it
is
the
end
of
civil
society.
it
ever
has
been
and
ever
will
be
pursued
until
it
be
obtained
or
until
liberty
be
lost
in
the
pursuit."
in
pursuing
the
demand
of
justice
for
racial
equality,
i
fear
the
court
today
loses
sight
of
other
basic
political
liberties
guaranteed
by
our
constitutional
system,
liberties
that
can
co-exist
with
the
proper
exercise
of
judicial
remedial
powers
adequate
to
correct
constitutional
violations.
