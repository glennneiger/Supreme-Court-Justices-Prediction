justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
state
help
out
the
court
by
making
a
lot
of
suggestions
as
to
how
it
might
have
been
done
differently?
justice
antonin
scalia
including
how
the
money
could
be
raised?
i'm
not
talking
about
the...
the...
the
nature
of
the
remedy,
i'm
talking
about
how
to
fund
the
remedy.
did
the
state
come
in
and
say,
why
don't
you
put
it
all
on
the
state,
your
honor?
that...
then...
then
there
wouldn't
be
any
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
saying
it
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
i
just
want
to
say,
it's
a
little
dog
in
the
manger,
isn't
it?
to
not
propose
that
below,
and
then
come
in
and
say,
he
should
have
laid
it
all
on
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
surely
it's
up
to
the
eighth
circuit
what
it
takes
before
the
eighth
circuit
to
file
a
petition
for
rehearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
the
eighth
circuit
if
it
wished...
indeed,
haven't
some
other
circuits
done
so
explicitly,
said
that
when
you
file
a
petition
for
rehearing
en
banc,
it
shall
be
deemed
to
be
a
petition
for
rehearing
with
suggestion
for
rehearing
en
banc?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
snyder--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
snyder,
it's
not
only
counsel
who
says
that
that's
wrong
but
it's
the
eighth
circuit.
you're...
you're
really...
you're
really
saying
that
despite
the
presence
of
some
evidence
to
the
contrary...
and
i
would
think
the
failure
of
the
eighth
circuit
to
issue
the
mandate
immediately
is...
is
substantial
evidence
that
it
didn't
make
up
this
view
of
the
matter
afterwards.
despite
that
evidence,
we
should
say
the
eighth
circuit
was
essentially
lying
when
it
said
this
is
how
we...
how
we
regarded
this
thing,
now
isn't
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i...
i'm
prepared
to
do
that
where...
where
there
is
a
lot
of
evidence
to
that
effect,
but--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
why
use
the
constitution,
mr.
snyder?
i
assume
it's
just
as
bad
for
the
state
to
violate
a
federal
law.
indeed,
when
a
state
violates
a
federal
law
it's
violating
the
constitution,
the
supremacy
clause.
so
i...
i
suppose
you
would
say
the
same
thing
for...
for
any
violation
of
a
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose,
mr.
snyder,
there...
there
are
a
large
number
of
people
who
are
violating
the
federal
law,
a
really
large
number,
and
the
courts'
marshals
can't
possibly
stop
the
violation,
and
the
court
says,
you
know,
what
i
really
need
is
an
army
and,
you
know,
it
tells
the
executive,
the
federal
executive,
this
situation
is
out
of
control,
they're
violating
federal
law,
and
the
executive,
for...
for
whatever
reason,
declines
to
use
federal
troops.
now,
do
you
think
the
court
has
the
power
in...
in
that
situation,
since
it
must
stop
the
violation,
to
requisition
the
state
national
guard
and
direct
it
in...
in...
in
battle?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
inappropriate.
i'm
talking...
never
mind
discretion.
does
it
have
the
power?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i'm
just
talking
about
power.
i'm
just
talking
about
power.
let's
assume
that
it's
practicable.
does
the
court
have
the
power
to
do--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
snyder,
do
we...
we...
i
mean,
do
we
really...
can
we
really
believe
that
from
this
record?
i
mean...
it...
it
is
the
case
that
half
of
the...
half
of
the
elementary
schools
are
magnet
schools,
and
every
single
one
of
the
secondary
and
high
schools
have
been
made
magnet
schools?
justice
antonin
scalia
one
of
them
bought
a
farm
so
that
it
could
specialize
in
farming.
that...
that...
that
was
in
the
order.
a
portion
of
the
order
rejected
the
state's
claim
that
you
didn't
need
so
much
money
for
painting
and
for
repairing
carpets
because
you
could
just
paint
the
portions
of
the
schools
that
needed
repainting,
and
the
court
said
no,
that
would...
that
would
not
give
a...
an
adequate
visual
attractiveness
that
you...
you
have
to
replace
all
of
the
carpeting
and
paint
the
entire
building.
and
you
think
that
all
of
this
on
its
face
represents
a
determination
that
this
was
essential
to...
to
cure
the
constitutional
violation,
so
essential
that
we're
going
to
raise
taxes
when
the
people
don't
vote
for
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
necessary
to
gold
plate
every
school
in
order
to
achieve
that
result?
if
there
is
no
way
to
get
people
to
come
back
into
the
kansas
city
schools
except
to
make
them
all
golden,
the
court
could
lay
a
tax
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm...
you
know,
i'm
not
sure.
where
you
want
certainty
is
ex
ante.
you
want
the
person
who
files
this
petition
to
know
whether
the
consideration
of
it
is
going
to
toll
his
time
to
appeal
and
to
tell
him
that
he's
only
going
to
know
that
when
the
court
comes
out
with
its
decision
that
says
well,
we've
treated
this
as
this,
or
we've
treated
it
as
the
other,
that
doesn't
help,
does
it?
