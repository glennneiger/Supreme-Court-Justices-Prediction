mr.
campbell,
what...
what
if
the
charge
were
of
a
conspiracy
or
a
scheme
to
defraud?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i...
i...
it
may
not.
what
would
your
view
be
about
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
does
that
broaden
the
range
of
possible
victims
and
amounts
of
restitution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
suppose
that
a
defendant
could
agree
to
pay
a
larger
sum
of
restitution
than
you
would
argue
for
in
this
case
if...
if
it
had
been
part
of
a
plea
agreement?
justice
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
wax,
certainly
the
language
of
the
statute
seems
to
tie
the
amount
of
restitution
to
the
harm
resulting
from
the
offense
of
conviction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but,
of
course,
it's
a
criminal
statute,
and
i
suppose
the
rule
of
lenity
and
strict
construction
comes
into
play.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
it
appears
to
be
tied
to
the
harm
resulting
from
the
offense
of
conviction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
wax,
this
looks
a
case
where
the
government
entered
into
a
very
poor
plea
agreement
from
the
standpoint
of
public
policy.
and
i
would
think
a
prosecutor
would
want
to
be
a
little
careful
before
entering
into
such
a
limited
agreement
with
someone
who
has
caused
so
much
harm
or
been
privy
to
much
broader
activity
than
that
encompassed
in
the
plea
agreement.
now,
i
guess
you
would
agree
that
the
prosecutor
doesn't
have
to
accept
a
limited
plea
bargain
like
this
or
go
along
with
it.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
does
that
mean
in
terms
of
actual
service
in
incarceration?
a
year
or
two?
