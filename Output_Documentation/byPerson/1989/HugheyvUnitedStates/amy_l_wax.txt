ms.
amy
l.
wax
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
--the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
under
the
victim
and
witness
protection
act
of
1982
a
defendant
who
is
convicted
of
or
pleads
guilty
to
an
offense
may
be
sentenced
to
pay
restitution
for
damage
caused
by
acts
for
which
he
has
not
been
found
guilty.
the
answer,
we
submit,
is
yes.
the
victim
and
witness
protection,
the
vwpa,
which
authorizes
a
court
to
order
restitution
to
any
victim
of
the
offense
of
which
a
defendant
is
convicted,
mandates
full
and
fair
restitution
to
that
victim,
restitution
that
reflects
a
realistic
assessment
of
the
harm
to
the
victim
caused
by
the
defendant.
thus,
as
virtually
every
lower
court
to
consider
the
question
has
held
the
amount
of
restitution
the
defendant
may
be
ordered
to
pay
is
not
limited
to
the
particular
loss
from
the
narrow
count
of
conviction.
if
the
courts
were
limited
to
considering
only
that
loss,
full
and
fair
restitution
to
victims
of
crime
would
often
be
impossible.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
we
believe
that
each
of
the
sections
that
uses
that
locution,
losses
resulting
from
the
offense
of
conviction,
of
which
there
are
three,
that
there
is
a
way
to
interpret
each
of
these
provisions
which
squares
with
our
view
of
the
statute.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
these
three
provisions
that
petitioner
alludes
to
do
not
contain
an
explicit
limit
on
the
amount
of
restitution
to
the--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
let
me,
if
i
may,
go
through
each
of
these
provisions
one
by
one
and
give
our
version
of
why
these
provisions
were
structured
and
written
as
they
are
written
and
what
congress
was
attempting
to
accomplish
with...
with...
with
these
sections.
first,
starting
with
3580(a)
and
(d)
which
petitioner
basically
relies
on
in
his
opening
brief.
3580(a)
we
see
has
a
two-part
structure.
it
first
says,
the
court
in
determining
whether
to
order
restitution
shall...
and
the
amount
of
such
restitution...
shall
consider
the
amount
of
the
loss
sustained
by
any
victim
as
a
result
of
the
offense.
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
"and
such
other
factors
as
the
courts
deem
appropriate.
"
now,
the
first
part
of
that
section
speaks
in
mandatory
terms.
it
tells
the
sentencing
court
what
it
shall
consider.
and
it
specifies
the
amount
of
loss
resulting
from
the...
the
offense,
which
we
maintain
is
only
part
of
what...
which
are
only
some
of
the
acts
the
court
can
consider...
can
consider.
it's
appropriate
that
in
speaking
in
mandatory
terms
the
provision
alludes
specifically
to
the
loss
resulting
from
the
offense
because
that
is
going
to
form
the
centerpiece
of
the
vast
majority
of
restitution
orders,
if
only
because
there
will
always
be
an
offense
of
conviction,
and
most
of
the
time
it's
the
offense
of
conviction
which
will
cause
the
harm.
there
may
be
many
cases
in
which
there
is
no
other
significant
harm
to
the
victim.
there
may
be
cases
where
the...
the
count
of
conviction
encompasses
all
of
the
damage
done
to
victims
and
there's
nothing
more
to
consider.
now,
it's
also
appropriate
that
the
damage
caused
by
any
related
acts
of
the
defendant
be
subsumed
or
covered
under
the
catchall
phrase
"and
such
other
factors
as
the
court
deems
appropriate.
"
because
that's--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
that's
the
discretionary
part.
that...
just
because
of
the
way
restitution
works,
in
our
view,
that
is
going
to
be
a
discretionary
part
of
the
order.
it
isn't
always
going
to
be
appropriate
to
include
harm
from
related
acts
in
the
restitution
order.
there's...
there's
a
constant
part
of
the
restitution
order
and
there's
a
variable
part
of
the
restitution
order.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
actually
not
because
one
of
the
things
that
we
think
comes
under
that
phrase
is
quite
parallel
to
what
the
court...
to
what
the
provision
mentions
in
the
very
first
section.
both
of
them
deal
with
harms
from
the
defendant's
acts,
both
of
them
deal
with
loss
to
the
victim
from
the
defendant's
acts.
it's
just
that
the
first
part
deals
with
the
core
of
the
restitution
order,
which
is
the
harm
from
the
offense,
and
the
under
the
second
part
goes
what
the
court
can
look
to
depending
on
the
circumstances.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
that's
true,
but
we
don't...
we
don't
see
that
clause
as
necessarily
just
referring
to
other
factors...
factors
with
respect
to
the
defendant.
we
think
it's
entirely--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
as
pertaining
to
different
acts
of
the
defendant
that
might
cause
a
loss,
depending
on
the
circumstances.
and,
of
course,
that
won't
always
be
the
case.
i
mean,
there
will
be
cases
where
there
isn't
any
other
loss
or,
if
there
is,
it
wouldn't
be
appropriate
for
various
reasons
for
the
court
to
take
it
into
account.
and
this...
this
reading...
we're
not
reading
this
section
in
isolation.
this
comports
with
the
way--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--yes,
we
do.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
where
it
says
"shall
consider"
so
the
court--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--oh,
yes.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
right.
i'm
mean,
we...
we
only
see
it
as
the
first
factor
we
look
at
but
we
don't
see
it
as
exhausting
all
of
the
harms
that
can
be
looked
at.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
there
are
three
general
provisions
of
the
statute
which
we
think
make
clear
that
congress
wanted
judges...
did
not
intend
for
judges
to
look
simply
at
the
technical
bounds
of
the
count
of
conviction.
and
we...
we
detail
those
in
our
brief.
the
first
is
3579(d)
which
says
the
order
shall
be
as
fair
as
possible
to
victims,
except
that
the
court
shall
not
prolong
and
complicate
the
sentencing
process.
and
if
it
would
complicate
and
prolong
the
sentencing
process,
then
the
court
has
discretion
to
cut
back
on
the
award.
the
second
is
the
general
statement
of
finding
and
purposes,
which
appears
on
page
(5)(a)
of
our
appendix
which
says
that
one
of
the
goals
of
the
statute
is
to
ensure
that
the
federal
government
does
all
that
is
possible
for
victims...
for
victims
without
infringing
on
the
constitutional
rights
of
defendants.
and
the
third
is
the
this
amendment
to
rule
32(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
to
provide
for
the
preparation
of
a
pre-sentence
report
which
speaks
in
the
most
sweeping
terms
possible
about
the
facts
that
are
to
be
gathered--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--on
5(a)
of
the
appendix
of
our
brief--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--at
the
bottom
section
2,
18
u.s.a.
1512
note,
section
2(b)(2).
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
at
the
very
bottom.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
you--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
petitioner
in
a
sense
cast
the
first
stone
in
this
because
he
did
rely
on
3580(a)
and
(d)
as
evincing
a
substantive
limit
on
the
amount
of
restitution.
we
think
that
those
two
procedural
provisions
can
fully
be
squared
with
the
absence
of
a
substantive
limit,
and
we
think
that
there
is
no
substantive
limit
in
3579.
the
core
of
the
authorization
to
grant
restitute...
to
award
restitution
to
victims
is
in
3579(a)(1),
where
the
court
says
when
sentencing
a
defendant
convicted
of
a
offense,
the
court
may
order
restitution
to
any
victim
of
the
offense.
and
even
though
petitioner
started
out
saying
that
that
limited
the
amount
of
restitution,
he
now
agrees
that
that
says
it
is
absolutely
silent
on
the
amount
of
restitution
that
can
awarded
to
the
victim.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
believe
that
to
rely
on
3579(b)
as...
as...
as
presenting
an
ironclad
limit
on
the
amount
of
restitution
to
the
count
of
conviction
is
to
completely
misinterpret
both
the
language
of
3579(b)
and
the--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--reason
why
it
was
put--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
there's--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
we
understand
it
as...
as
allowing
the
court
to
use
the
calculus
prescribed
in
(b)
for
parallel
instances
of
property
loss
or
damage
or
bodily
harm
that
are
caused
by
other
than
the
conduct
of
conviction.
we
do
not
read
this...
this
phrase
"in
the
case
of
an
offense
resulting
in
damage
to
or
loss.
"
et
cetera,
as
language
of
limitation.
if
anything,
its
language
of
illustration.
the
focus
of
this
provision
is
on
giving
the
court
guidelines
for
calculating
a
restitution
in
the
case
of
bodily
injury
or
loss
of
property,
and
the
reason
that
congress
put
it
in,
was
to
work
in
tandem
with
3579(d)
to
make
sure
that
the
courts
would
have
a
way
of
simplifying
and
expediting.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
except--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
we...
the
legislative
history
reveals
that...
or
at
least
experience
with
the
previous
law
i...
i
would
rather
say,
revealed
that
the
hangup
was
how...
deciding
how
to
calculate
the
various
components
of
damage
and
what
should
be
left
in
and
what
should
be
taken
out.
that
problem
arises
with
regard
to
the
offense
of
conviction
amount
as
much
as
to
the
amount
that
might
be
awarded
for
other
acts.
and
so
this
provision
solves
the
problem
for
both
components
of
the
award.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
i'm...
i'm
not
implying
that
it
is
necessarily
simply
illustrative
with
regard
to
the
category
of
the
types
or
components
of
damages
that
can
go
into
the
award.
i...
i
am
saying
that
it
is
illustrative
with
regard
to
a
completely
different
category,
which
is
the
acts
that
can
give
rise
to
the
harm,
the
types
of
actions
that
could
be
the
source
of
the
harm
or
the
cause
of
the
harm.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
and
those
are
two
completely
different
categories.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
okay.
the
first
category
is
what...
is
this
provision
is
concerned
with.
that
is
an
entire
focus
of
this
provision.
the
first
category
is
just...
is
incorporated
in
here
in
one
line
of
locution,
which
we
think
does
not
exhaust
the
possibilities
for
the
award
of
damages.
we
think
it
leaves
open
the
possibility
of
awarding
damages
resulting
from
other
acts
of
the
defendant
that
are
not
encompassed
by
the
literal
terms
of
the
count
of
conviction.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
we
do
think
there
are
limits,
yes.
we
don't
think
that
the
sentencing
court
has
unlimited
discretion--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
well,
there
are
three
possible
sources
of
limitation.
one
is
that
congress
in
its
wisdom
incorporated
the
limitation
that
it
has
to
be
harm
to
the
victim
of
the
offense.
so,
there
are
certain
victims
that
are
going
to
get
compensation
and
unfortunately--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--there
are
certain
that
are
going
to
be
left
out.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
secondly--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--right.
the
second
limitation...
and
here
is
in
the
concept
of
restitution
itself.
it
has
to
be
an
order
of
restitution.
and
that
means
that
there...
there
should
be
some
linkage,
some
relationship,
between
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
that's
taken
into
account,
the
related
conduct.
there
has
to
be
some
unity
between
that
conduct
and
the
actual
offense
of
conviction.
so
an
act
by
the
defendant
that
harms
the
victim
which
is
remote...
extremely
remote
in
time
or
has
no
clear
connection
to
the
episode
or
the
ongoing
course
of
conduct
of
which
the
count
of
conviction
is
a
part
would
probably
be
inappropriate.
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
the
judge
to
include
that
in
the
order
of
restitution,
and
it
could
well
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
and
to
understand
that,
one
needs
to
look
at
the
purposes
of
restitution
and
the
nature
of
restitution.
the
purposes
of
restitution,
as
with
other
criminal
sanctions,
are
deterrence,
retribution
and
rehabilitation.
--and
it
is
abundantly
obvious
that,
for
example,
restitution
for
a
mere
fraction
of
the
harm
that
the
defendant
actually
did
to
the
victim
would
not
adequately
serve
those
purposes.
but
the
flip
side
of
that
is
that
restitution
for
very
remote
or
unrelated
harms
would
not
really
add
to
the
power
and
the
value
of
the
sanction
of
restitution
for
this
crime.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
there's
no
doubt
that
in
the
practical
application
of
this
statute,
as
congress
wrote
it,
there
are
victims
who
are
going
to
lose
out.
i
mean,
if...
if
the
pattern
of
a
certain
crime
is
multiple
instances
of
violations
directed
at
many,
many
different
victims,
which
sometimes
happens,
for
example,
with
mail
fraud
counts,
then
the
fact
is
that
there's
not
going
to
be
terribly
effective
restitution
to
the
mass
of
victims
if
the
conviction
is
limited
to
one
count.
congress
structured
the
act
this
way.
we
think
it
had
good
and
sensible
reasons
for
doing
it
because
it
does
create
boundaries,
it
does
cabin
the
sentencing
court's
discretion
in
a
way
that
is...
makes
a
lot
of
sense
for
restitution,
which
is
about
the
relationship
between
the
victim
and
the
defendant
and
the
confrontation
between
the
victim
and
defendant
and
measures
whereby
the
defendant
makes
the
victim
whole.
so
we
understand
the
concern
that
you're
speaking
of
and
it
is
a
concern
but
this
is
the
way
congress
wrote
the
statute,
in
our
opinion.
i
was
speaking
of
the
general
provisions
of
the
statute
which
in
our
view
buttress
our
reading
of
the
statute
as
permitting
the
sentencing
judge
under
appropriate
circumstances
to
go
beyond
the
offense
of
conviction
to
look
at
the
harm
done
by
the
defendant
to
the
victim.
and,
as
i
said,
there
were
three
provisions
of
the
statute
which
we
believe
can
be
read
to
mandate
full
and
fair
restitution
and
to
show
that
restitution
confined
to
the
count
of
conviction
could
not
possibly
fulfill
congress'
purposes
in
enacting--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--well,
i...
i
guess
we'd...
i'd
have
to
say
that
perhaps
can
be
read
is...
is
not
the
best
way
of
putting
it.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
we
think
it
must
be
read
because
of
what
congress
was
trying
to
accomplish
with
this
statute
and
because
the
reading
that
petitioner
urges
would
so
eviscerate
the
efficacy
of
these
restitution
provisions
that
we
just
can't
believe
that
this
is
the
way
congress
meant
for
them
to
be
interpreted.
and
we're
not
just
saying
that
out
of
thin
air.
we
think
that
that
impulse
finds
substantiation
in
particular
provisions
of
the
statute,
which
admittedly
some...
some
of
which
speak
in
general
terms,
but
which
we
think
show
congress'
intent.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
your
honor,
we
don't
think
so.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
first
of
all,
it's
true
that
we
could
attempt
to
elicit
a
promise
from
the
defendant
that
they
pay
comprehensive
restitution
flowing
from
all
the
counts
that
we
think
they
are
guilty
of
in
the
process
of
hammering
out
a
plea
agreement
on
a
very
narrow
count.
we
could...
the
prosecutor
could
try
and
get
that
promise
out
of
the...
the
defendant.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
no,
we
don't
think
so.
and
this
case
illustrates
why
that
promise
is
so
odious.
this
individual
has
13
years
to
pay
restitution.
if
he
willfully
reneges
on
his
promise
to
pay
restitution
at
year
10,
we
do
not
think
that
the
prosecutor
has
a
realistic
prospect
of
reviving
the
charges
that
he's
relinquished
as
part
of
the
deal
and
making
them
stick.
the
fact
is
that
victims
will
suffer,
and
defendants
will
go
scot
free.
they
will
not--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--that's
correct.
the
prosecutor
doesn't.
but...
and
we...
we
don't
actually
think
that,
as
these
matters
go,
the
prosecutor
did
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
or
anything
that,
you
know,
he
shouldn't
have
done
here.
i
mean,
this
individual
was
sentenced
to
eight
years
in
jail
on
the
basis
of
the
plea
to
this
single
count.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
well,
this
was
before
the
sentencing
reform
act.
i
actually
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
but
he
did
receive
a
substantial
jail
term.
but
that's
just
the
point.
the...
the
prosecutor
got
a
plea
bargain
which
involved
a
substantial
jail
term,
which
more
or
less
comports
with
our
view
of
the
kind
of
penalty
that
an
individual
should
get
for
pilfering
$90,000.
but
in
doing
so,
he
had
to
sacrifice
a
tremendous
amount
of
restitution.
he
basically
had
to
go
down
to
1/100th
of
the
value
of
what
this
person
took
from
the
bank,
which
we
think
is
virtually
as
good
as
no
restitution
at
all.
and
this
will
happen
over
and
over
again,
we
think,
if
this
court
embraces
petitioner's
view
of
the
statute.
it
will...
it
will
impale
prosecutors
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma,
it's
true.
the
question
will
be
should,
you
know,
should
i
accept
this
plea
bargain
which
necessarily
involves
convicting
the
person
on
fewer
counts
than
he
was
indicted
on,
or
even
that
we
think
could
prove,
and
thereby
sacrifice
the
interest
of
victims.
and
we
don't
think...
we
think
congress
was
aware
of
prosecutorial
practice
and
we
don't
think
that
congress
wanted
that
kind
of
sacrifice
of
victims'
interests
where
again
and
again
in
the
statute,
in
the
legislative
history,
it
emphasized
that
full
and
fair
restitution
to
victims
was
its
goal.
ms.
amy
l.
wax
yes,
but
once...
but
there,
that
estoppel
provision,
3580(e),
does
limit
estoppel
to
the
acts
involved
in
the
narrow
offense
of
conviction.
so
it
doesn't
help
the
individual--
ms.
amy
l.
wax
--we
think
it
does
help
our
case
and
so
did
the
court
below,
your
honor,
because
in
saying
the
offense
involving
the
acts
giving
rise
to
restitution,
that
provision
implies
that
there
might
be
acts
giving
rise
to
restitution
that
are
not
part
of
the
offense.
and
that's
how
the
court
below
interpreted
it
as
in
fact
implying
a
more
expansive
view
of
the
statute.
so,
we
would
disagree
with
that.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
