justice
kennedy
could...
could...
could
the
court
order
a
payment
for
these
other
counts,
maybe
even
to
other
banks
as
a
condition
of
probation?
justice
kennedy
of
course,
then
there
wouldn't
be
a
judgment
under
this
section
in
the
sense
of--
justice
kennedy
--it
would
be
a
different
type
of
order.
justice
kennedy
--it
doesn't
say
how
much.
justice
kennedy
of
course,
one
of
the
collateral
effects
of
your
argument...
there
are
other
banks
here.
and
the
mbank
i
believe,
which
was
the
one
that
got
the
restitution
order,
in
effect
may
have
gotten
all
this
man's
assets.
it
got
a
huge
order
of
restitution.
and
the
other
banks
could
that
were
just
in
counts
that
were
not
prosecuted
or
not
subject
to
plea
agreement
received
nothing.
and
that's
a
collateral
effect
of
what
you
argument
and...
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
square
with
evenhanded
restitution.
i
recognize
no
one
argues
you
can
give
restitution
to
other
victims.
but
that's
a
collateral
effect
of
what
your
arguing
here.
