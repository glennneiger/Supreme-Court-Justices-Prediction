justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-5691,
frasiel
hughey
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
campbell.
chief
justice
rehnquist
just
where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
campbell?
chief
justice
rehnquist
whereabouts
on
page
a-1?
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can't
you
also
derive
some
comfort
from
the
ejusdem
generis
rule,
or
the
noscitur
a
sociis...
whatever
you
want
to
call
it...
that
the
catchall
phrase
does
not...
is
thought
to
be
limited
to
the
same
types
of
things
that
the
earlier
parts
of
the
clause
are
contained?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
what
is
the
relevancy
of
these
provisions
to
the
provisions
that
we're
interpreting,
mr.
campbell?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
the
language
that
is
in...
in
effect
that
governs
your
client's
case
is
the
word
"the"
or
the
word
"such"?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
but
didn't
congress
change
in
'86...
change
from
"the"
to
"such"?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
does
that
'86
amendment
govern
your
client's
case
or
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
if
there
is
no
difference
in
the
meaning...
between
such
and
the,
then
it's
immaterial
obviously
whether
it
governs
your
client's
case
or
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
campbell.
ms.
wax.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you...
you...
you
say
it's
appropriate
that
that
be...
what
does
that
mean?
chief
justice
rehnquist
may
i
ask--
--yes,
but
you're...
you're...
you're...
you're
reading
something
into
this
kind
of
catchall
phrase
that
gives
it
a
much
different
contact...
content
than
the...
the...
the
clauses
that
come
before
it,
it
seems
to
me,
which
isn't
the
way
you
would
ordinarily
read
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but...
if...
if...
if
you
read
it
as
it
is,
you...
you
say
a
court
shall
consider
the
amount
of
the
loss
sustained
by
any
victim
as
a
result
of
the
offense.
the
financial
resources
of
the
defendant,
the
financial
needs
and
earning
ability
of
the
defendant
and
the
defendant's
dependents
and
such
other
factors
as
the
court
deems
appropriate.
now
the
last
two
parts
of
that
are
related
to
the
defendant's
ability
to
pay
and
the
defendant's...
that...
that
sort
of
thing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
see
it
as...
as
actually
broadening
the
language
of...
of
the
amount
of
the
loss
sustained
by
any
victim
as
a
result
of
the
offense?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wax.
mr.
campbell,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
campbell.
the
case
is
submitted.
