treason.
i
suppose
there's
no
identifiable
victim
of
treason.
justice
scalia
ms.
wax,
the
section
you've
been
talking
about,
as
mr.
campbell
pointed
out,
is
entitled
procedure
for
issuing
order
of
restitution,
and
it
is
really
the
previous
section,
3579,
that
sets
forth
what
the
order
of
restitution
may
be.
and
wherever
the
statute
refers
to
the
order,
it
says
in
ordering
restitution
under
this
section.
that
is,
under
3579.
3580
says
that
as
well...
the
court
in
determining
whether
to
order
the
restitution
under
section
3579.
i
really
interpret
the
structure
to
be
that
3579
says
what
the
maximum
can
be,
and
it
sets
forth
quite
explicitly
what
restitution
may
be
ordered.
and
3580
i...
i
regard
as
being
a
provision
that
says
to
what
extent
you
may
go
below
the
maximum
permitted
by
that.
it,
of
course,
begins
by
reciting,
"shall
consider
the
amount
of
the
loss
sustained.
"
but
that's...
that's
all...
as
recited
in
3579.
and
then
it
says,
however,
you
can
consider
all
these
other
things,
the
financial
resources.
if
you
can't
afford
the
whole
loss,
you
don't
charge
the
whole
loss.
why
isn't
that
a
more
logical
way
to
read
the
thing
than...
than
to
try
to
read
new
substantive
provisions
into
3580,
a
provision
that
is
entitled
procedure?
justice
scalia
ms.
wax,
what...
what
also
suggests
to
me
that
79(b)
is...
is
exclusive
and
sets
forth
the
only
kind
of
restitution
you
can
get
is
the
fact
that
it's
so
comprehensive.
it
goes
right
down
even
kind
of
injury
there
could
be
to
a
victim.
it
begins
with
property
and
then
it
says
bodily
injury
in
(2),
and
then
(3)
is
death.
and
incidentally
in
the
case
of
death,
under
(3),
all
this
provides
for
his
pay
an
amount
equal
to
the
cost
of
necessary
funeral
and
related
expenses.
now,
since
you
consider
that
just
illustrative,
i
suppose
you
would
say
that
federal
judges
can
invent
wrongful
death
amounts
for...
for
death
to...
to...
to
an
individual.
can...
can...
can
they
do
that?
justice
scalia
i
see.
i
see
what
you
mean.
justice
scalia
fair
enough.
justice
scalia
there
is
another
provision
of
the
statute,
of
course,
that
makes
it
easy
for
the
victims
to
file
and
win
a
suit.
it...
it
does
provide
that
in
any
civil
action
brought
by
a
victim,
the...
the
acts
constituting
the
offense
will
be
conclusively
established,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
help
your
case
either.
