justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
campbell,
may
i
ask
one...
one
question?
do
you...
do
you
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
amount
is
not
necessarily
limited
to
the
amount
specified
in
the
indictment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you'd
agree,
even
as
strict
property
law
case
there
was
a
robbery
of
a
hundred...
an
alleged
robbery
of
$1,000
and
the
evidence
shows
it's
really
$1,500,
they
could
recover
the
full
$1,500?
justice
stevens
but
may
i
ask
you...
do
you
think
the
judge
had
discretion
to
order
restitution
in
an
amount
less
than
the
amount
of
the
loss
if,
for
example,
there...
at
the
showing
of
the
defendant
doesn't
have
any
money
and
he
can't
raise
the
money
and
so
forth?
justice
stevens
so
that
you
aren't
saying
the
amount
of
the
loss
is
a
minimum
that
applies
in
all
cases.
but
whereas
if
it's
treated
as
a
maximum,
then
all
these
other
factors
go
to
whether
or
not
you
give
them
the
maximum,
or
an
appropriate--
justice
stevens
--that's
right,
rather
than
shall
award.
justice
stevens
see,
if
it...
if
it
were
a
minimum,
you'd
say
"shall
order"
that.
but
if
you
say
it's...
it's
a
maximum,
you
say
you
considered
as
the
first
factor
you
look
at.
justice
stevens
but
there's
nothing
else
in
the
statute
that
refers
to
other
harms
unless
you
read
it
into
"such
other
factors",
of
course.
justice
stevens
well,
tell
me...
you
went
a
little
fast
for
me.
where
in
5(a)
does
it
say
the
government
must
do
everything
possible
for
every
victim?
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
2(b)(2).
at
the
very
bottom
of
5(a)?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
justice
stevens
i
know,
but
today
he
relied
3579(b)
and
that
does
talk
about
values
rather
specifically.
justice
stevens
well,
there's
certainly--
justice
stevens
--is
nothing
in
3579(b)
that
suggests
anything
larger
than
the
value
of
the
property
that
was
taken,
is
there?
justice
stevens
there's
quite...
quite
a
detailed
description
of
return
the
property,
return
its
value,
return
its
value
less
what
they
got
from
a
third
party.
there's
a
whole
scheme
based
on
value
without
the
slightest
hint
of
something
in
excess
of
value.
or
at...
do
i
misread
it?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
the
puzzling
thing
about
this
argument
is
the
easiest
case
is
where
you
know
a
specific
loss
of
$1,000,
and
you
don't
need
a
lot
of
guidelines
to
say
give
back
the
money.
but
if
you're
going
to
say
in
addition
to
giving
back
the
money,
you've
got
to
loss
at
all
these
other
intangibles
out
there,
i'd
think
you'd
need
guidelines
for
the
case
where
you
want
more
than
what
was
stolen.
justice
stevens
that's
where
you
have
the
real
problems
in
deciding
how
much.
and
they
never
even
mention
that
possibility.
these
are
kind
of
lousy
guidelines
if
that's
what
you're
saying
they're
intended
to
do.
justice
stevens
could
i
just
make
one...
one
observation?
you
repeatedly
said
these
provisions
can
be
read
in
such
and
such
a
way.
don't
you
think
there's
a
sort
of
a
duty
of
fair
notice
to
the
defendant
that
they...
they
must
be
read
this
way
when
you're
ordering
restitution
of
nine
time
the
amount
that
was
specified
in
the
event?
the
mere
fact
that
a
statute
can
be
read
to
support
this
kind
of
result,
is
that...
is
that...
do
you
think
that's
enough
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
stevens
i
don't
think
it
is.
