mr.
campbell,
help
me
out
with
one
respect.
in
3580
at
the
top
of
page
85
of
your
brief,
is
the
phrase
"sustained
by
any
victim,
as
a
result
of
the
offense.
"
on
your
theory,
why
shouldn't
that
be
the
victim
as
a
result
of
the
offense?
can
you
explain
the
word,
the
use
of
the
word
"any"?

rather
than
any.
what
about
the
possibility
that
there
would
be
no
victim?
driving
so
as
to
endanger
or
something
of
that
sort.
i
mean
i
assume
there
are
offenses
that
don't
have
any
particular
victim.
so...
so
you
would
say
"any"
to
cover
the
case
where
there
isn't
any.
