justice
white
3579
doesn't
say
how
much...
how
much
restitution.
justice
white
yeah,
but
now
you
have
to
get
the
3580,
i
guess.
justice
white
uh-huh.
justice
white
what
is
your...
what
is
the
limit?
is
there
some
outside
limit
on
what
compensation
you
think
can...
can
be
ordered?
how
would
you
describe
it?
justice
white
it
seems
to
me
you'd
certainly
leave
a...
a
judge...
a
judge
has
a
duty
under
(a)(2)
that
if
he
doesn't
order
restitution
or
orders
only
partial
restitution,
he
has
to
give
his
reasons.
justice
white
how
does...
how
does
he
ever
know
when
he's
ordering
only
partial
restitution
under
your
theory--
justice
white
--which
seems
to
be
so...
be
so
open-ended
that...
you
tell
me
what
their
limits
are?
justice
white
oh,
i
understand
that.
justice
white
but
you
just
say--
justice
white
if
you
lose
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
government
can
always
protect
itself
against
too
narrow
a
restitution
order.
in
your
plea
bargaining
arrangement
you
can
bargain
about
restitution.
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
but
you
couldn't
get
it
in
an
order,
you
don't
think,
if
you
loss
this
case?
