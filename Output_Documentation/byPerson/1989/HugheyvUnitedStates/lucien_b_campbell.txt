mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
calls
upon
this
court
to
interpret
the
reach
of
a
criminal
statute,
the
restitution
provision
of
the
victim
and
witness
protection
act
of
vwpa.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
was
charged
with
offenses
of
embezzlement
of
mail
and
fraudulent
use
of
credit
cards.
pursuant
to
a
plea
agreement
which
was
silent
as
to
restitution,
he
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to
count
4
only
of
the
indictment.
count
4
of
the
indictment
charged
that
on
or
about
october
18,
1985
he
fraudulently
used
a
credit
card
issued
by
mbank
to
one
hershey
godfrey
and
thereby
caused
losses
aggregating
more
than
$1,000.
in
the
interim,
between
his
plea
of
guilty
and
the
sentencing
hearing,
he
received
notice
from
the
probation
service
of
the
court
that
it
was
proposing
a
restitution
order
far
in
excess
of
losses
on
the
count
of
conviction.
he
filed
a
timely
written
objection
to
that
notice,
pursuant
to
local
procedure.
at
the
sentencing
hearing
information
presented
was
that
the
total
losses
on
the
godfrey
credit
card,
which
was
the
subject
of
the
count
of
conviction,
was
about
$10,000,
speaking
in
round
numbers,
and
the
issuing
bank,
mbank,
suffered
overall
losses
of
about
$90,000.
over
the
petitioner's
renewed
objection
that
such
a
restitution
order
would
exceed
both
the
limits
of
the
law,
and
his
ability
to
pay,
the
court
sentenced
him
to
pay
$90,000
in
restitution
within
five
years
after
expiration
of
an
eight-year
term
of
imprisonment.
now,
in
this
case
we
turn
first,
as
we
expect
the
court
will,
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
it
is
reproduced
in
our
opening
brief
in
the
appendix
at
page
a-1.
turning
here
i
see
that
section
3579
provides
that
the
court
when
sentencing
a
defendant
convicted
of
an
offense--
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
--i'm
in
my
opening
brief
at
appendix
page
a-1,
your
honor.
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
section
3579(a)(1)--
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
--order
of
restitution,
provides
that
the
court
when
sentencing
a
defendant
convicted
of
an
offense,
and
the
language
pertinent
to
this
case
is
"may
order
that
the
defendant
make
restitution
to
any
victim
of
such
offense.
"
now,
this
part
says
who
pays...
the
defendant,
and
who
receives...
a
victim
of
such
offense.
and
the
respondent
has
agreed
with
us
that
that
language
means
a
victim
of
the
offense
of
conviction
in
3579(a)(1).
now,
going
forward
in
the
statute--
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
go
to--
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
--well,
i
believe
that
we
would
go
next
to
3579(b).
subsection
(b),
which
begins
on
our
page
a-1
and
extends
over
to
a-2--
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
--sets
out
the
covered
losses
and
remedies.
in
fact,
there
are
three
of
them.
property
loss,
bodily
injury,
funeral
expense
when
death
results.
the
one
that
governs
this
case
is
set
out
on
appendix
page
a-1,
the
same
page
i
was
reading
from;
(b)(1)
governs
property
loss.
it
provides
that
in
the
case
of
an
offense
resulting
in
loss
of
property
of
a
victim
of
the
offense,
the
order
may
require
that
such
defendant
return
the
property
to
the
owner
of
the
property
or
pay
the
value
of
the
property.
now,
because
they
is
simply
nothing
to
suggest
that
the
meaning
of
the
term
3579(b)(1)
authorizes
the
court
to
order
return
of
the
property
taken
in
the
offense,
and
does
not
authorize
anything
more
than
that.
now,
the
government
relies
in
large
measure
on
section
3580(a),
reproduced
at
appendix
pages
a-4
and
a-5
in
our
brief.
we
rely
on
it
also
because
we
believe
that
it
supports
our
reading
of
this
statute.
it
says
that
the
court
shall
consider
the
amount
of
the
loss
sustained
by
any
victim
as
a
result
of
the
offense.
here
again,
with
nothing
to
indicate
that
the
offense
means
anything
different
from
what
it
meant
back
in
3579.
now,
the
government
would
argue
that
the
catchall
language
at
the
end
of
3580(a)
must
mean
that
the
court
has
authority
to
order
restitution
beyond
the
offense
of
conviction.
what
this
section
does
is
say
that
the
court
shall
consider
loss
sustained
by
the
victim
as
a
result
of
the
offense,
certain
factors
bearing
on
the
defendant's
ability
to
pay
and
such
other
factors
as
the
court
deems
appropriate.
i
think
i
should
respond
to
this
because
the
government
places
considerable
reliance
on
that
catchall
phrase
in
3588
expanding
the
plain
language
of
3579.
i
would
note,
first,
that
3580
is
a
procedural
section.
it
is
so
titled,
it's
called
procedure
for
issuing
order
of
restitution.
its
content
is
largely
procedural.
by
its
terms,
i
believe
it
applies
only
after
the
court
has
decided
that
restitution
is
already
covered
under
section
3579,
the
section
that
is
more
substantive.
it
says
page
a-4),
"the
court,
in
determining
whether
the
order
restitution
under
section
3579
of
this
title,
and
the
amount
of
such
restitution.
"
i
believe
this
means
that
unless
the
court
has
already
determined
that
restitution
is
covered
under
section
3579,
then
the
court
does
not
reach
3580(a).
now,
i
think
it's
also
significant
that
the
government
is
asking
a
general
catchall
phrase
to
expand
other
specific
provisions
of
the
statute.
we
say
that
3579(b)...
(b)(1)
property
loss,
is
very
specific
in
authorizing
the
remedy
in
the
case
of
an
offense
resulting
in
loss
of
property,
to
return
that
property
or
pay
its
value.
and
it
simply
cannot
be
the
duty
that
the
government
would
assign
to
it
of
expanding
a
specific
provision.
now,
while
the
statute
has
no--
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
do
rely
on
that
rule.
it
would
first
be
taken
to
refer
to
items
of
the
same
character
in
the
list
which
precede
it.
that
is,
the
loss
sustained
by
the
victim
of
the
offense
and
factors
bearing
on
the
defendant's
ability
to
pay.
but
even
if
it
is
read
to
have
more
general
application
beyond
that
list
in
which
it
appears,
then
we
say
that
it
applies
to
the
authority
expressly
conferred
in
this
statute
to
order
partial
restitution
or
no
restitution.
and
because
it
so
clearly
refers
to
that,
it
cannot
support
the
government's
meaning
of
expanding
authority.
and
i'm
referring
back
to
3579(a)(2)
on
appendix
page
a-1,
which
says
that
if
the
court
does
not
order
restitution
or
orders
only
partial
restitution,
the
court
shall
state
the
reasons.
so
this
statute
specifically
contemplates
that
in
a
proper
case
a
court
may
order
only
partial
restitution
or
no
restitution.
in
the
language
of
35--
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
--your
honor,
that
is
the
rule
that
the
ninth
circuit
seems
to
have
adopted,
and
throughout
this
case
we
have
not
challenged
that
rule
because
we
don't
believe
that
it
applies
to
this
case.
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
i
can...
i
can--
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
--it
certainly
would
have
that
practical
effect,
justice
o'connor,
but
i...
i
see
some
support
to
that
rule
because
i
can
certainly
understand
that
in
an
offense
such
as
mail
fraud,
a
particular
scheme
to
defraud
is
an
element
of
that
defense.
and
for
a
person
to
stand
guilty
of
mail
fraud,
for
example,
that
person
must
be
proven
guilty
of
that
larger
scheme.
so,
we
have
not
challenged
that
rule,
and
i
see
some
support
for
it.
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
a
defendant
may
certainly
agree
to
do
that,
justice
o'connor.
we
note
that
the
respondent
seems
to
ascent
that
there's
no
admissions
exception.
the
courts...
the
courts
of
appeals
have
frequently
applied
such
an
exception.
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
could
be
enforced
as
part
of
a
plea
bargain.
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
and
respondent
alludes
to
that
in
their
brief.
in
other
words,
if
a
defendant
entered
into
a
plea
agreement
calling
for
him
to
make
total
restitution
beyond
the
offense
of
conviction
and
willfully
failed
to
follow
through
on
that
plea
agreement,
he
would
be
a
peril
of
the
government
reinstating
dismissed
counts,
for
example.
so
even
if
there
is
no
admissions
exception
that
would
make
such
an
order
of
restitution
fully
enforceable
under
this
statute,
it
is
certainly
enforceable
in
other
ways.
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
your
honor,
the
courts
are
not
clear
over
whether
the
old
federal
probation
act
continued
in
effect
after
the
enactment
of
the
victim
and
witness
protection
act.
in
other
words,
during
the
period
of
time
when
both
were
facially
in
effect
some
of
the
courts
so
held
at
that
time,
even
when
both
of
these
laws
were
in
place
side
by
side,
that
where
a
court
imposed
probation
it
could...
it
did
have
greater
flexibility
in
imposing
conditions
of...
restitution
as
a
condition
of
probation.
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
no,
your
honor
it
would
not
be--
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
--it
would
not
carry
the
enforcement
provisions,
for
example.
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
i
believe,
justice
blackmun,
that
it's
clear
from
the
statute
as
a
whole
that
there
may
be
more
than
one
victim
of
the
offense
of
conviction,
even
though
the
statute
would
limit
a
recovery
to
a
victim
of
the
offense
of
conviction
that
there
may
be
more
than
one
victim.
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
if
there...
that
certainly...
that's
certainly
one
view
justice--
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
--that's
certainly
correct.
in
our
further
interpretation
of
section
3580(a)
we
believe
that
instead
of
expanding
the
substantive
reach
of
this
statute
it
would
reach
other
factors
that
the
court
would
consider
in
deciding
whether
to
order
partial
restitution
or
no
restitution.
and
two
of
those
that
i
see
are
specifically
mentioned
in
the
statute.
3579(d)
on
appendix
page
a-2
says
that
if
the
court
finds
that
it
would
unduly
complicate
or
prolong
the
sentencing
proceeding
to
fashion
an
order
of
restitution,
the
court
may
order
no
restitution.
that's
certainly
a
factor
that
the
court
might
consider.
3579(e)(1)
up
at
the
top
of
page
a-3,
the
court
shall
not
impose
restitution
for
a
loss
for
which
the
victim
has
received
or
is
to
receive
compensation,
except
that
in
the
interest
of
justice
the
court
may
order
restitution
to
the
person
compensating,
thus,
introducing
a
new
test...
interest
of
justice.
in
addition,
this
is
not
a
statutory
factor,
but
an
obvious
factor,
is
that
in
a
multi-defendant
case
i
can
certainly
imagine
the
court
considering
how
to
apportion
restitution.
in
other
words,
considering
whether
to
apportion
it
on
relative
ability
to
pay,
relative
culpability,
relative
gain
or
some
combination
of
factors.
and
all
of
these
are
factors
that
the
court
might
well
consider
under
3580(a)
that
go
to
imposing
partial
or
no
restitution,
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
imposing
restitution
beyond
the
count
of
conviction.
so,
i
simply
don't
see
how
the
catchall
can
carry
the
burden
that
the
government
would
assign
to
it.
this
is
a
case
where
we
suggest
that
the
unambiguous
language
of
the
statute
limits
restitution
to
the
offense
of
conviction
and
the
court
should
so
hold.
now,
if
the
court
should
find
some
ambiguity,
then
it
would
be
proper
to
resort
to
customary
rules
of
statutory
construction.
turning
first
to
the
legislative
history,
i
believe
that
the
court
will
find
an
extraordinarily
explicit
record
that
directly
supports
the
petitioner's
interpretation.
at
the
same
time,
this
record
does
not
contain
any
suggestion
to
support
respondent's
expansive
reading
of
this
statute.
the
first
thing
that
we
would
look
at
is
h.r.
6915
in
the
96th
congress,
1980,
a
progenitor
or
forerunner
of
the
1982
vwpa.
we've
reproduced
the
pertinent
parts
in
our
reply
brief
at
appendix
pages
2
and
3.
it
will
be
seen
that
section
3331
was
the
analog
or
forerunner
of
our
substantive
section
3579,
a
defendant
who
has
found
guilty
of
an
offense
may
be
sentenced
to
make
restitution
to
a
victim
of
the
offense.
and
3332,
nature
of
a
sentence,
is
the
analog
of
3579(b)(1),
which
gives
the
covered
loss
and
remedy
in
the
property
loss
case.
a
defendant
may
be
sentenced
in
the
case
of
an
offense
resulting
in
loss
of
property,
to
return
such
property
or
pay
its
value.
now,
congress
used
that
type
of
language
in
1980,
and
what
is
perhaps
more
important
is
what
congress
understood
that
that
language
meant.
in
the
accompanying
committee
report,
also
reproduced
in
our
reply
brief,
appendix
page
9,
congress
said
of
that
section,
"restitution
may
only
be
imposed
with
respect
to
damages
established
by
the
conviction.
"
"restitution
cannot
be
imposed
for
damages
caused
by
the
conduct
in
charges
that
are
dismissed.
"
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
the
relevance
that
i
see,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
language
is
functionally
identical
to
what
congress
ultimately
passed
in
1982
in
the
vwpa.
and
this
shows
congress'
understanding
of
what
that
language
would
accomplish.
and
the
record
shows
nothing
that...
to
show
that
congress
changed
course
in
that
two-year
period.
when
congress
enacted
the
vwpa
in
1982,
there
was
a
significant
expansion
from
existing
law.
and
that
is
it
freed
the
restitution
order
from
conditions
of
probation.
and
congress
used
very
express
language
when
it
when
it
did
that
in
3579.
so
the
court
may
order
restitution
in
addition
to
or
in
lieu
of
any
other
penalty
authorized
by
law.
and
at
the
same
time
in
the
senate
judiciary
committee
report
accompanying
that,
it
explained
what
it
had
done.
it
said
section
3579(a)
expands
current
law
by
authorizing
an
order
of
restitution
independent
of
a
condition
of
probation.
nowhere
did
it
say
that
they
expanded
current
law
by
permitting
restitution
beyond
the
offense
of
conviction.
in
that
report,
the
senate
report
accompanying
the
vwpa
when
it
was
enacted,
shows
that
congress
was
fully
aware
that
the
existing
federal
probation
act
limited
restitution
to
the
offense
of
conviction.
the
report
quoted
it.
but
nowhere
in
the
section
of
the
senate
report
problems
of
current
law,
or
anywhere
in
that
report,
did
the
committee
say
that
it
is
a
problem
of
this
law
that
it
limits
it
to
the
offense
of
conviction.
and
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
simply
inconceivable
that
congress
would
bring
about
so
major
a
change
in
the
federal
criminal
law,
as
respondent
urges,
without
accounting
for
it
in
the
legislative
history.
the
next
item
in
the
history
we
believe
is
significant
is
the
1986
amendment
of
section
3579.
in
that
year
as
part
of
a
technical
amendments
bill,
congress
amended
3579(a)(1)
in
one
respect
so
that
the
last
phrase
read
instead
of
restitution
to
any
victim
of
the
offense,
it
said
any
victim
of
such
offense.
and
the
accompanying
report
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
amendment
was
to
clarify
that
any
victim
of
such
offense
referred
back
to
the
offense
of
conviction.
and
as
well,
that
report
cited
to
an
earlier
report,
a
year
earlier,
that
said
explicitly
that
the
vwpa
limited
restitution
to
the
offense
of
conviction.
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
the
word
(b)(1).
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
we
take
the
position
that
it
does,
your
honor.
when
congress
amended
the
statute
in
1986
it...
it
said
this
amendment
will
take
effect
upon
enactment,
which
was
after
commission
of
the
offense
in
this
case
but
prior
to
sentencing
in
this
case.
and
congress
also
took
pains
to
say
that
no
substantive
change
was
intended
by
that
amendment.
no
change
in
the
meaning
of
the
statute
was
intended.
so
i
see
no
reason
why
the
congressional
intent
cannot
be...
cannot
be
given
effect.
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
it...
it
is
only
significant
if
the...
if
the
court
has
need
to
resort
to
the
legislative
history
accompanying
the
'86
amendment.
we
believe
that
the
meaning
is
the
same
in
1982
and
1986,
and
under
either
version
the
result
needs
to
be
the
same
in
this
case.
the
only
significance
would
be
the
weight
to
be
given
to
the
legislative
history
of
the
1986
amendment.
so,
to...
to
recap
briefly
this
legislative
history,
for
the
better
part
of
this
century,
since
the
federal
probation
act
of
1925,
congress
had
said
that
restitution
is
limited
to
the
offense
of
conviction.
the
forerunner,
a
progenitor
of
this
law
in
1980,
congress
said
that
functionally
identical
language
to
what
was
eventually
passed
would
so
limit
restitution.
when
congress
passed
the
vwpa,
it
said
we
have
expanded
restitution
beyond
conditions
of
probation.
it
did
not
say
we
have
expanded
restitution
beyond
the
offense
of
conviction.
and,
finally
congress
amended
this
law
in
1986
to
make
it
abundantly
clear
that
the
offense
means
the
offense
of
conviction.
i
believe
that
where
the
legislative
intent
is
so
plainly
expressed,
and
especially
where
it
is
consistent
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
the
petitioner's
right
to
relief
is...
is
clear.
if--
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
--i...
i
certainly
agree
with
that,
justice
stevens,
because
the
statute
contemplates
that
there
are
certain
covered
losses
that
are
not
going
to
be
part
of
the
indictment,
such
as
therapy
of
a
victim,
such
as
lost
income
in
the
case
of
bodily
injury.
and
i
think
some
of
the
court's
went
astray
and
seeing
that
necessarily
they
were
going
to
have
to
look
outside
the
indictment
to
find
some
of
the
covered
losses
that
induced
them
to
look
further
outside
the
indictment,
further
than
what
the
language
would
bear.
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
provided
that
it's
supported
by
conviction
for
that
offense.
and
that
was
the
position
that
we
took
in
this
case
where
the
government
alleged
only
the
jurisdictional
amount,
alleged
an
amount...
an
amount
aggregating
more
than
$1,000.
but
petitioner
proposed
a
restitution
order
of
$10,000,
all
of
the
losses
on
the
hershey
godfrey
credit
card
as
being
fairly
within
the
compass
of
this
statute.
but
if
any
of
this
analysis
should
leave
any
residual
ambiguity
at
this
point,
then
i
would
refer
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
criminal
statute,
and
we're
not
here
to
find
out
what
happened
to
the
limitation
that
the
old
federal
probation
act
had,
but...
but
to
look
at
this
statute
and
see
what
does
it
expressly
authorize,
because
when
we
are
speaking
of
criminal
penalties
for
criminal
offenses
it
is
a
question
of
what
has
the
congress
expressly
authorized.
where
the
court
of
appeals
found
an
ambiguity
in
this
language
it
erred
by
interpreting
the
statute
expansively
against
the
individual.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
even
address
or
recognize
the
effect
of
rule
of
lenity
and
in...
in
its
decision.
but
this
court
has
said
on
many
occasions
that
when
it's
called
upon
to
choose
between
two
possible
meanings
of
criminal
statute,
it
will
require
that
congress
speak
clearly
and
distinctly
before...
before
choosing
the
harsher
alternative.
and
i
believe
that
rule
as
well
guides
the
court
in
this
case.
if
it
please
the
court,
i'd
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
lucien
b.
campbell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
i'd
like
to
suggest
the
petitioner's
interpretation
would
in
no
way
eviscerate
the
victim
and
witness
protection
act.
apart
from
the
government's
considerable
power
to
insist
on
full
restitution
where
appropriate
as
part
of
a
plea
agreement,
the
statute
involved
in
this
case,
credit
card
fraud,
specifically
permits
aggregation.
not
only
of
amounts,
but
of
credit
cards.
and,
in
fact,
count
6
of
the
indictment
that
appears
in
the
joint
appendix,
page
5
and
6,
one
of
the
dismissed
counts,
aggregated
not
only
amounts
but
two
different
credit
cards.
if
the
government
in
this
case
had
considered
it
so
important
to
obtain
a
conviction
that
would
support
an
order
of
full
restitution
under
the
vwpa,
it
could
have
insisted
on
a
plea
of
guilty
to
a
count
aggregating
all
of
these
losses.
the
other
half
of
the
government's
argument
other
that
the
catchall
phrase
in
3580(a),
seems
to
be
general
legislative
purposes...
that
is,
to
restore
victims.
congress
did
have
that
goal
within
the
limits
of
the
criminal
justice
system.
but
at
the
same
time,
congress
had
a
very
specific
purpose
to
limit
restitution
to
the
offense
of
conviction.
and
this
court
has
repeated
as
recently
as
last
month
in
the
crandon
and
boeing
case
that
general
expressions
of
legislative
purpose
can
rarely
carry
the
burden
of
expanding
a
criminal
statute
beyond
what
is
clearly
warranted
in
the
text.
i
believe
that
congress
balanced
competing
interests
when
it
passed
the
vwpa,
it
perpetuated
the
bright
line
of
restitution
limited
to
losses
established
by
the
offense
of
conviction.
and
that
is
a
line
that
serves
all
of
the
interests
well.
