mr.
mark
granzotto
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
reasons
why
the
decision
of
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
should
be
affirmed.
the
first
is
based
on
this
court's
decision
last
term
in
von
raab,
and
also
in
the
court's
decision
in
skinner.
in
that
case...
in
those
two
cases,
this
court
indicated
the
situations
under
which
the
court
would
refer
to
the
balancing
test
in
determining
whether
a
particular
fourth
amendment
intrusion
was
in
fact
unconstitutional.
in
von
raab
and
skinner,
this
court
indicated
that
where
the
particular
type
of
intrusion
serves
law
enforcement
needs...
or,
excuse
me...
serves
governmental
needs
beyond
the
normal
need
for
law
enforcement,
then
the
court
would
refer
to
a
balancing
test.
this
case
presents,
for
the
first
time,
i
believe,
in
this
court,
a
situation
in
which
a
suspicionless,
warrantless
seizure
is
being
conducted
solely
for
one
purpose.
and
that
is
to
enforce
the
criminal
laws.
under
the
decisions
of
this
court's
last
term,
in
skinner
and
von
raab,
this
court
need
not
even
refer
to
the
balancing
test,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
reason
this
particular
seizure
takes
place
is
to
in
fact
enforce
the
criminal
law.
mr.
mark
granzotto
martinez-fuerte...
justice
powell,
in
his
decision
in
that
case,
in
a
footnote,
indicated
that
many
of
the
seizures
which
take
place
in
a...
at
the
border
search
or
at
the
border
stops,
resulted
in
something
which
did
not
go
to
a
formal
charge.
but,
in
fact--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
martinez-fuerte
was
of
course
a
criminal
case.
but
to
go
back
to
almeida-sanchez,
three
years
before
martinez-fuerte,
justice
powell,
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
that
case,
indicated
that
only
3
percent
of
all
cars
that
were
stopped...
or,
excuse
me...
of
all
persons
who
were
stopped
for
violations
of...
of
the
border...
illegal
aliens,
only
3
percent
of
those
people
were
in
fact
prosecuted.
therefore,
we
have
a
situation
which
is
just
like
new
york
v.
burger
in
that,
indeed,
it's...
there's
an
overwhelming
noncriminal
purpose
to
the
stops
which
took
place
in
martinez-fuerte.
mr.
mark
granzotto
but...
but
it
wasn't
being
enforced
through
means
of
a
prosecution
was
the
point.
mr.
mark
granzotto
well,
it
makes
a...
it
would
make
a
difference--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--excuse
me?
mr.
mark
granzotto
skinner.
mr.
mark
granzotto
yes.
they
did,
in
fact.
because
in
the
von
raab
case,
for
example,
there
was
no...
there
was...
there
was
no
chance
of
there
ever
being
a
criminal
prosecution
in
light
of
the
fact
that
these...
the
testing
which
took
place
in
von
raab
couldn't
be
used
unless
by
the
agreement
of
the
person
whose
test
was
being
taken
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
mark
granzotto
no,
that's
not
what
i'm
saying.
this
court
has
decided
in
new
york
v.
burger
that
a...
a
particular
type
of
scheme
can
have
both...
both
an
administrative
nature
and
a
criminal
nature.
martinez-fuerte
fit
squarely
within
the
dichotomy
which
was
drawn
in
this
court
in
new
york
v.
burger,
because,
as
justice
powell
indicated,
only
3
percent
of
these
cases
actually
result
in
prosecution.
mr.
mark
granzotto
well,
i
would...
in...
in
response
to
your
original
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
also
indicate
to
the
court
that
this
court
has
indicated
since
martinez-fuerte
that
there
is...
there
is
a...
a
nexus
to
the
border...
the
border
which
allowed
the
court
to
make
the
decision
in
martinez-fuerte
as
it
did.
and
that's
the
case
of
montoya
de
hernandez.
because,
in
that
case,
the
court
indicated
that
the
decision
in
martinez-fuerte
was,
in
fact,
connected
to
this...
this
country's
vested
right
to
protect
its
borders.
and
in
that
sense,
the
whole
concept
of
a
probable
cause
or
reasonable
suspicion
requirement
was
automatically
out
of
the
martinez-fuerte
case
to
begin
with.
mr.
mark
granzotto
to
some
extent,
those
cases
may
fell...
fall
within
the
balancing
test,
even
under
this
court's
decision
in
von
raab
and
skinner,
because
they
may
involve,
in
particular
states
certainly,
noncriminal
prosecutions,
or
at
least
a
situation
in
which
there
is
both
an
administrative
aspect--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--well,
there's
another
construct
to
the
fourth
amendment
which
may
come
into
play
in
the
situation
of
a
truck
and
a
weigh
station,
and
that
is
the
heavily
regulated
industry
concept
which
has
been
developed
by
the
court
and
applied
in
a
number
of
cases.
that
may
well
take
it
outside--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--but
it
is...
excuse
me...
it
is
regulated
because
of
the
weight
of
the
vehicle.
that's
why
the
weigh
stations
exist,
to...
to
impose
certain
restrictions
on...
on
the
weights--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--no.
the
heavily
regulated
industry
construct,
which
this
court
has
adopted,
is
based
on
one...
one
thing.
and
that
is,
a
piece
of
legislation
or
a
number
of
pieces
of
legislation.
the
weigh
stations
have
nothing
to
do
with
whether
it
is
in
fact
a
heavily
regulated
industry.
mr.
mark
granzotto
yes.
indeed.
and
as
i
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
there
are
certain
vehicle
checks
which
could
exist
in
michigan
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question
to...
to
the
petitioner's
attorney.
these
particular
stops
in
michigan
have,
in
fact,
been
decriminalized
recently,
as
colonel
hough
testified
in
his
testimony
at
the
trial
in
this
case.
in
that
situation,
as
i've
indicated
in
my
brief,
those
types
of
suspicionless,
warrantless
stops
would
be
subject
to
the
balancing
test,
which
this
court
has
developed.
mr.
mark
granzotto
this
court
case?
let
me
just
say
i
want
to
correct
one
thing.
this...
this
check
lane
was
stopped
by
stipulation
of
the
parties
after
the
first
time
that
it
had
been
instituted
in
michigan.
we
actually
brought
this
case
prior
to
the
imposition
of
the
first
checkpoint
to
try
to
prevent
it
from
taking
place
at
that
time.
it
had
been
in
operation
for
an
hour--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--justice
kennedy,
this
program--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--no.
no,
not
at
all.
this
program
was
copied
from
a
program
which
was
developed
by
the
state
of
maryland
and
the
state
police
of
maryland.
and
copied
very
liberally,
i
would
say,
from
that
program.
and
the
maryland
program
had
been
in
existence
for
approximately
four
years.
in
addition,
there
was
a
considerable
amount
of
experience
outside
the
united
states
prior
to
the
maryland
program,
which
analyzed
these...
the
effectiveness
of
these
sobriety
roadblocks.
and
that's
the...
that
is
the
type
of
evidence
which
was
presented
in
this
case
through
dr.
ross.
now
dr.
ross,
who
has
analyzed
extensively
the
studies
that
have
been
conducted
worldwide
on
the...
on
the
subject
of
sobriety
roadblocks,
testified
in
this
case.
and
what
he
testified
to
went
directly
to
the
balancing
test
which
the
court
applied
in
both
the
michigan
court
of
appeals
and--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
granzotto
well,
my
position
is
that,
with
respect
to
a...
an
investigation
and
attempting
to
find
criminal
wrongdoing,
that
there
is
something
fundamentally
different
about
that,
and
a
stop
for...
a
for
vehicle
code
violation
or...
or
a
toll
booth.
mr.
mark
granzotto
but
the
purpose
is
achieved
through
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law.
mr.
mark
granzotto
no.
mr.
mark
granzotto
no.
the
first
that
you
are
describing
is
something
that
would...
certainly,
in
michigan,
in
light
of
the
decriminalization...
be
subject
to
the
balancing
test.
the
point...
the
only
point
i
would
raise
in
light
of
von
raab
and
skinner
is
that,
if...
if
the
purpose
of
the
intrusion
is
to
purely
serve
the
criminal
law,
then
that...
that
intrusion
is
unconstitutional
without
even
a
resort
to
the
balancing
test.
let
me
go
to
the
balancing
test,
which
has
been
talked
about
at
length.
there...
there
are
three
factors
which
were
analyzed
in
this
case.
the
gravity
of
the
public
harm
is
the
first.
and
on
that
we
have
no
dispute.
we
did
not
bring
this
case
to
minimize
the
dangers
associated
with
drunk
driving
in
this
country.
what
we
attempted
to
prove
and
did,
in
fact,
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
trial
court
in
this
case
was
that
sobriety
roadblocks
are
just
not
an
effective
means
of
addressing
that
serious
societal
problem.
we
presented
in
this
case
the
testimony
of
dr.
ross.
dr.
ross
is
a
preeminent
expert
in
the
area
of
deterring
the
drunk
driver.
what
dr.
ross
testified
to
on
one
point
was
totally
uncontradicted
at
trial.
and
that
was
that
as
a
means
of
actually
arresting
drunk
drivers,
sobriety
roadblocks
are
worthless.
sobriety
roadblocks
do
not
achieve
significant
numbers
of
arrests.
mr.
mark
granzotto
it's
not
exactly
defined,
but
what
dr.
ross
i
believe
was
talking
about
when
we
was
talking
about
worthless
is
that
you
are
taking,
you
are
removing
a
number
of
officers
from
a
practice
which
does
have
positive
effect,
and
that
is
roving
patrols.
you
are
taking
officers
away
from
that,
that
goal,
and
applying
them
in
a
particular
area
to
conduct
these
sobriety
roadblocks.
mr.
mark
granzotto
no.
i...
i--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--no,
no,
because,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
this
case
the...
the
witnesses
called
by
the
state,
their
own
witnesses--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--acknowledged--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
granzotto
what
is
important
about
this
case
is
that
the
witnesses
who
testified
for
the
state
in
this
case,
the...
colonel
hough,
who
was
the
head
of
the
michigan
state
police,
testified--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--absolutely
not
because
dr.
ross's
testimony
was
absolutely
consistent
with
every
piece
of
evidence
presented
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
granzotto
it's...
it's
cumulative
because
colonel
hough
testified
that
the
program
was
not
being
developed
to
arrest
drunk
drivers,
to
actually
remove
them
from
the
road.
lieutenant
fledseth
testified
to
the
same
point.
these
programs...
this
program
in
michigan
is
not
developed
to
remove
drunk
drivers
from
the
road.
it
is
like
the
maryland
program
which
lieutenant
cotton
testified
to,
because--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--no.
what...
it's
clearly--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--no.
it
is...
it
is
still
to
enforce
the
criminal
law
because
they...
they
do
result--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--they
do
result
in
arrests.
approximately
1
percent
or
somewhat
less
than
the
cars
which
drive
through
a
sobriety
roadblock
will
result
in
arrest.
those
people
will
be
arrested.
there
will
be
criminal
prosecution
resulting
from
that.
what
everybody
testified
in
this
case
totally--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--yes,
it
would
be.
mr.
mark
granzotto
no,
there's
no
statistical
evidence
of
that.
what
dr.
ross--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--the
hypothetical
you've
given
me...
the
hypothetical
you've
given
me
is
not
the
type
of
deterrence
that
the
state
of
michigan
is
after
in
this
case.
they
are
not
looking
for
people
who
are
circumventing
road
blocks
by
going
to...
by
taking
another
route.
they
are
attempting
to
justify
this
program
on
the
basis
that
it
actually
deters
people
from
driving
after
they
have
been
drinking.
mr.
mark
granzotto
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
that--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--that
is
not
the...
that
is
not
the
type
of
deterrents
which
i
think
the...
the
state
of
michigan
is
looking
for
in
this
case
either.
but,
let
me--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--well,
that's
an
interesting
question
in
light
of
the
factual
record
that's
been
made
in
this
case.
i
would
begin
talking
about
the
factual
record
by
telling
you
that
i
am
not
at
all
afraid
and
all
about...
all
of
the
statistics
in
all
of
the
studies
that
have
been
cited
in
the
briefs
of
the
amicus
curiae
in
this
case,
the...
the
statistics,
the
studies
do
not
establish
that
these
sobriety
roadblocks
are
effective.
nonetheless--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--they
don't
work.
mr.
mark
granzotto
no.
mr.
mark
granzotto
they
don't
work
because
there
are
two
possibilities
that
these
sobriety
roadblocks
can
serve.
one
is
to
actually
physically
remove
drunk
drivers
from
the
road.
everybody
who
testified
at
the
trial
in
this
case
agreed.
they
don't
work
on
that
basis.
we're
not
even
instituting
them
on
that
basis.
that's
what
the
state
police
testified
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
granzotto
1
percent
or
less
of
the
people
going
through
these
things.
mr.
mark
granzotto
compared
to
what
could
occur
if
the
15,
12,
17
officers
who
are
dedicated
to
one
spot
were
allowed
to
do
what
they
normally
do,
which
is
operate
on
the
basis
of
reasonable
suspicion
in
a
roving
patrol.
mr.
mark
granzotto
the
state
can
make
all
the
arguments
it
wants
on
that
point,
but
it's
first
of
all
contrary
to
the
record,
and
second
of
all,
not
even
supported
by
any
of
the
studies,
i
believe,
that
they've
cited
in
their--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--no.
because
what...
what
was
introduced
in
this
case
was
an
attack
on
the
causal
relationship
between
number
of
arrests
and
the
deterrent
value
of
the
sobriety
roadblocks.
what
was
established
at
the
trial
in
this
case,
what
the
trial
court
found
was
that
there
is
a...
there
is
a
close
relationship
between
the
number
of
arrests
and
the
deterrent
value.
we...
we
have
a
situation
where
the
state
comes
into
court
acknowledging,
although
not
before
this
court,
i
might
add,
since
they've
altered
their
position
dramatically
before
this
court,
but
they
came
into
court
saying
that
these...
this
program
is
not
designed
to
perfect
arrests
because
it
really
won't
be
that
effective
in
perfecting
arrests.
but
we
want
this...
we
want
this
program
because
it's
going
to
deter.
we
presented
evidence
in
this
case
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
a
close
relationship,
an
undeniable
relationship
between
the
power
to
arrest
under
this
program
and
the
power
to
deter.
mr.
mark
granzotto
it's
a
question
which
i
can't
answer.
mr.
mark
granzotto
would
they
need
to
arrest?
mr.
mark
granzotto
again,
it
is
a
question
which
never
came
up
in
this
case.
mr.
mark
granzotto
give
you
one
that's
right?
mr.
mark
granzotto
a
percentage,
first
of
all,
would
be...
that
would
be
right
would
be
one
in
which
the
number
of
arrests,
for
example,
per
manhour
out
on...
out
on
a
sobriety
roadblock
would
be
better
than
the
number
of
arrests
that
you
get
per
manhour
in
a
roving
patrol.
mr.
mark
granzotto
i'm
afraid
i
can't
answer
that
question.
mr.
mark
granzotto
i
don't
know.
mr.
mark
granzotto
no.
what...
what
is...
what
is
involved
in
these
checkpoints,
and
reading
the
amici
briefs
that
have
been
filed
in
this
case,
one
point
that
appears
frequently
and
dramatically
is
visibility.
these
are
a
very
visible
means
of
showing
that
something
is
being
done
on
the
drunk
driving
problem.
in
michigan
i
would
suggest
to
you,
justice
white,
that
this
program
was
done
despite
the
hesitancy
of
the
michigan
legislature.
it
was
done
at
the
request
of
the
governor
of
the
state
of
michigan.
and
in
my
estimation,
it
was
done
precisely
because
this...
this
type
of
law
enforcement
mechanism
is
visible.
it
doesn't
necessarily
work,
but
it's
visible.
it
shows
that
somebody's
attempting
to
do
something
about
the
drug
testing...
about
the
drunk
driving
problem.
mr.
mark
granzotto
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
the--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--principal--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--i
would
assume
by
their
amicus
brief--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--that's
been
filed
in
this
case,
but
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
perhaps
they
are
more
interested
in
the
constitutional
law
that's
going
to
be
developed
if
this
court
approves
this
type
of
sobriety
roadblock
because
we
get
into
the
question
of
whether
there
can,
in
fact,
be
mass
investigations
of
people.
and
in
that
sense,
mr.
justice
white,
we
may
have
a
situation
where
there
is
the...
the
end
result
of
the
court's
decision
in
this
case
may
be
far
more
important
to
the
law
enforcement
people
in
this
country
than
any
decision...
any
indication,
let
me
say,
that
these
sobriety
roadblocks
actually
work
in
this
country.
mr.
mark
granzotto
no.
mr.
mark
granzotto
no.
it
is
not
only...
let
me
say
it
is
not
only
that
it
is
the
less
effective
way,
let
me
say,
than...
than
roving
patrols.
that's
not
the
only
point.
the
fact
is
that
these
types
of
seizures
will
result
in
a
limited
number
of
arrests,
first
of
all.
they're
not
going
to
accomplish
what
they
want
to
accomplish.
it's
not...
it
just
not
going
to
serve
the
purpose
in
comparison,
i
will
grant
you,
in
comparison
to
what
the
police
could
be
doing
in
other
settings.
but
as
this
court
found
in
delaware
v.
prouse
there
is
a
sort
of
marginal
utility,
if
you
will,
to
the...
a
police
technique
which
has
to
be
analyzed
by
this
court.
in
delaware
versus
prouse,
for
example,
the
court
found
that
these
types
of
stops
which
were
at
issue
in
that
case
weren't
going
to
result
in
a
marginal
increase
in
the...
in
the
problem,
the
crime
problem
which
the
police
were
attempting
to
combat
in
that
situation.
the
same
is
true
in
this
case.
the
third
prong
which
i
would
like
to
address
of
the
court's
balancing
test
concerns
the
scope
of
the
intrusion,
and
on
this
point
i
think
there's
a
couple
of
misconceptions
regarding
the
position
which
the
state
has
taken
in
this
case.
the
state
attempts
to
justify
this
program
on
the
basis
that
this
is
a
minimal
intrusion
for
approximately
30
to
60
seconds.
in...
in
fact,
there
are
a
number
of
other
factors
related
to
the
intrusion
which
impact
on...
on
the
analysis
which
this
court
must
apply
in
the
balancing
test.
first
of
all,
there
is
the...
the
point
which
has
been
made
before
with
respect
to
the
number
of
innocent
drivers
passing
through
these
checkpoints.
at...
at
its
best,
these
checkpoints
allow
99
percent
of
the
cars
to
go
through
because
these
people
are
innocent
of
any
wrongdoing.
in
addition,
there
is
another
disquieting,
i
believe,
aspect
to
these
sobriety
roadblocks
which
has
come
out
in
the
evidence
in
this
case,
and
that
is
there
is
a
significant
number
of
what
i
would
call
false
positives
which
have
been
developed.
in
other
words,
the
program
works
that
people
will
go
through
a...
go
through
these
sobriety
roadblocks,
be
stopped
temporarily...
that
is,
the
stop
which
the...
which
the
state
represents
as
being
very
short
in
duration.
in
actuality,
a
number
of
people
will
be
diverted
to
another
area
where
they
will
be
further
investigated,
including
a
number
of
tests.
what
the
evidence
from
other
sobriety
roadblocks
has
indicated
is
that
you
have
twice
as
great
a
possibility
of
being
diverted
to
these...
for
this
further
investigation
and
not
being
drunk
than
you
have
of
being
drunk
when
you're
diverted
to
these--
mr.
mark
granzotto
--that's
correct,
after
further
investigation,
obviously,
and
more...
obviously
more
extensive
investigation
that's
been...
that
takes
place.
there
are...
as
well,
there
is
a
point
made
by
the...
the
state
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
discretion
which
is
allotted
the
people
who
conduct
these
patrols.
the
state
argues
that
that
discretion
limits
the
scope
of
the
intrusion
which
is
involved
in
the
case.
we
had
testimony
in
this
case
from
inspector
fladseth
of
the
state
police
who
indicated
that
when
a
person
approaches
this
sobriety
roadblock,
that
person
can
be
diverted
for
further
investigation
for
any
reason
or
for
no
reason
at
all;
therefore,
the
answer
that
was
supplied
before
with
respect
to
failing
to
open
the
window,
if
somebody
could
be
diverted
for
further
investigation
for
failing
to
open
the
window,
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
they
can
be,
because
inspector
fladseth
candidly
acknowledged
during
the
course
of
his
testimony
that
the
officer
who
is...
who
is
confronting
the
person
driving
up
in
the
car
can
divert
that
person
for
further
investigation,
more
extensive
investigation,
for
any
reason,
or
for
no
reason.
mr.
mark
granzotto
that's
correct.
i...
i
am
also
concerned
and...
about
the
scope
of
the
intrusion
which
can
take
place
in
these
sobriety
roadblocks,
because
if
this
court
does
in
fact
approve
sobriety
roadblocks,
the
stop
itself,
there
are
a
number
of
necessary
results
which
would
obtain
on
the
basis
of
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
on
the
basis
of
pennsylvania
v.
mimms
and
on
the
basis
of
brown
v.
texas.
there
are
a
number
of
actions,
conduct
which
the
police
can
take
in
this
situation,
undeniably,
if
this
court
does
in
fact
approve
sobriety
roadblocks;
that
is,
the
stop
itself.
we
brought
this
case
not
in
attempt...
not
in
an
attempt
to
demonstrate
that
drunk
driving
is
not
a
serious
societal
problem
in
this
country.
what
we
attempted
to
show
in
this
case,
what
in
fact
the
trial
court
did
adopt
in
this
case,
was
that
sobriety
roadblocks
are
not
an
effective
means
of
combatting
that
serious
societal
problem.
under
the
balancing
test,
therefore,
what
we
have,
i
believe,
is
a
serious
problem.
we
have
a...
an
intrusion
which
may
be
minimal
in
some
respects,
but
it
is
an
intrusion
which
does
not
accomplish
anything.
and
on
that
basis
we
would
ask
that
under...
under
the
court's
balancing
test
as
it's
been
adopted
that
these
sobriety
roadblocks
be
found
unconstitutional.
thank
you.
