justice

marshall
well,
when
you're
stopped
by
a
police
officer,
aren't
you
normally
very
nervous
if
you're
perfectly
sober?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
people
did
not
drive
who
were
drunk
because
of
that
roadblock?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
know
you
can't.
[laughter]
but
how
many
do
you
say
they
need
to
arrest,
what
percentage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
to
be
good,
for
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you're
sure
that
this
is
wrong.
now
give
me
one
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you're
sure
that
1
percent
is
wrong.
well,
can
you
give
me
what
percentage
is
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
arrests
do
you
get
per
man-hour
do
you
get
for
dope
in
detroit?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
certainly
can't.
you
just
pick
out
one.
i
wonder
if
it's
so
wasteful,
if
these
checkpoints
are
so
wasteful
why...
why
there
are
some
30
or
so
states
in
here
defending
these
checkpoints.
