are
the
same
standards
applicable
to
a
vehicle
safety
inspection
stop
and
a
sobriety
checkpoint,
same
balance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
same
legal
standards,
same
rules?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
the
u-turn
provide
probable...
articulate
suspicion
for
a
stop?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--does
refusal
to
roll
down
the
window
itself
constitute
part
of
the
suspicion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
one
of
the
factors?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it's
still
not
clear
to
me
what
we
looked
at...
how
do
we
decide
reasonableness?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
these
statistics
irrelevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
do
look
at
the
statistics?
they
are
relevant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
long
was
the
program
in
operation
before
the
suit
was
brought?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
how
long?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
long
had
this
checkpoint
been
in
operation
before
it
was
stopped
by
the
court
order?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if...
if
you
sought
to
enjoin
it
before
it
even
was
established,
then
how
did
you
expect
the
state
to
have
any
statistical
evidence
as
to
its
operation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the...
the
sooner
you
bring
it,
the...
the
better
off
your
suit
is,
because
the
state
has
no
statistics
to
back
up
what
they're
doing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
it
was
improper,
in
your
view,
for
michigan
to
even
enact
this
statute
and...
and...
and
to
try
to
administer
the
roadblock
on
its
own
and
gather
its
own
statistics?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
want
us
to
say
this
is
unconstitutional
if
there's
a
more
effective
way
of
apprehending
drug...
drunk
drivers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
precisely
your
answer
to
justice
marshall,
it
seemed
to
me.
