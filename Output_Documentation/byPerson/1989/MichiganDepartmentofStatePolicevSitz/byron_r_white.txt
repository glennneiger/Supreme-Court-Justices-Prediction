justice
byron
r.
white
well,
surely
the
state
courts
thought
that
there
was
standing
for
purposes
of
a
state
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you're
on...
you
were
on
the
losing
side?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
stuck
with
the
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
just
to
say
that
the
purpose
is
not
to
enforce
the
criminal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
they
don't
remove
them
from
the
road?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
you
were...
know
from
listening
to
the
radio
or
something
that
there's
a
checkpoint
at
a
very
dangerous
intersection
that
you
usually
go
through.
you're
going
to
have
a
few
drinks,
so
you
just
decide
that
you
better
not
go...
you
should
take
another
route.
that
would
be
sensible,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you...
is
there
any
evidence
in
this
case
or
could
there
be
how
many
people
were
deterred
by...
by
their
knowledge
of
a
checkpoint,
deterred
from
going...
from
going
through
that
particular
dangerous
intersection?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
it...
is
it...
is
it
sort
of
a...
just
an
irrational
thought
that
a
lot
of
people
who
might
go
through
that...
that...
that
intersection
without
the
checkpoint
don't
go
through?
is
that
just
irrational?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
deters
them
from
driving
through
that
particular
dangerous
intersection.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
make
them
drive
someplace
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
something
we
can't
look
at
or
not
in
sustaining--
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just...
they're
all
just
misled.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
states...
the
states
would
rather
have...
these
30
states
apparently
would
rather
have
checkpoints
than
deploy
their
officers
otherwise.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wouldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
