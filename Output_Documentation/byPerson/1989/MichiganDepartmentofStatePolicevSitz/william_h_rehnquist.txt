we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
88-1897,
the
michigan
department
of
state
police
v.
rick
sitz.
mr.
casey.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
casey,
when
you
say...
when
you
say
this
is
a
seizure,
you
mean
it's
a...
it's...
it's
like
an
arrest
or
it's
like
a
terry
stop?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
casey,
you
said
general
notice
is
given.
a...
a
notice
is
given
that
a
checkpoint
will
be
established
somewhere
in
saginaw
county?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
you're
talking
about
says
several
of
what
bay
cities
and
several
cities--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and...
but...
all...
all
that's
known
in
advance
is
that
it
will
be
in
saginaw
county?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
casey.
mr.
nightingale,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
it
was
stopped
because
the
court
enjoined
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nightingale.
mr.
granzotto,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
martinez-fuerte?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
was...
it
was
enforcing
the
criminal
law,
nonetheless?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to...
to
say
that
they're...
end
up
not
being
prosecuted
doesn't
mean
they
weren't
being
used
to
enforce
the
criminal
law.
that
was
the
only
law
on
the
books
there
was
that
was
being
enforced,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
does
that
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
did
the
cases
you
rely
on,
last
year,
make
that
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
cases
you
rely
on
that
we
decided
last
year,
von
raab
and
the
other--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--skinner
case,
make
the
point
that
you're
making?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but,
i
thought
the
point
you
were
making
was
that
martinez-fuerte
was
really
not
a
criminal
case,
because
so
few
people
were
prosecuted
under
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
doesn't
mean
it's
an
admitted...
an
administrative
scheme.
it's
not
as
if
there
was
some
administrative
procedure
that
was
being
enforced
in
martinez-fuerte.
it
was
just
different
levels
of
the
criminal
process.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
long
had
this
checkpoint--
--certainly,
there
are
a
great
number
of
regulations
of
automobiles,
safety
requirements
and
so
forth
that
are
contained
in
statutes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
he
define
significant
and
how
did
he
define
worthless?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
the...
the...
if
the
state
feels
differently,
if
the
state
after
evaluating
its
enforcement
proceedings
feels
that
the
roving
patrols
don't
do
the
job
and
that
this
checkpoint
should
at
least
be
given
a
try,
they're
not
entitled
to
do
that
if
some
expert
takes
the
stand
and
says
it...
it...
i
think
differently.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
about
what
it
amounts
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no,
but
i
was
talking
about--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
was
talking
about
dr.
ross's
testimony.
you
summarized
it,
i
thought,
and
he
said
these
were
worthless
because
they
didn't
catch
drunken
drivers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well...
and
i
take
it
you're
relying
on
that
testimony
because
you
feel
it
supports
the
finding
of
the
trial
court.
and
my
question
to
you
is,
is
the
trial
court
on
the
basis
of
the
testimony
of
someone
like
dr.
ross
entitled
to
substitute
its
judgment
for
that
of
the
state
as
to
which
of
these
procedures
work
best?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
ready
to
write
off
dr.
ross'
testimony
in
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
okay.
but
you
began
by
mentioning
his
testimony,
so
i
presumed
it
was
important
to
you.
but
now
you
seem
to
suggest
well,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
he
said
because
other
witnesses
said
the
same
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
what
do
we
mean
by
the
word
"effective"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
a
value
judgment,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you...
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
they
don't
work?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
don't
work
in
the
sense
that
they
only
arrest,
what,
2
percent
or
something?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
well,
but
compared
to
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
state's
argument
here
is
that
that
is
even
less
effective.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
the
state,
in
order
to
determine
how
to
deploy
its
resources
in
solving
this
problem
has
to
come
in
with
statistical
surveys
that
satisfy
a
trial
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so...
so
of
those
diverted,
one-third
are
found
to
be
drunk
and
two-thirds
are
released?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if...
if
only
1
percent
of
drunk
driving
is...
are
arrested
in
this
manner
and
one-third
of
those
diverted
are
found
to
be
drunk,
only
3
percent
then
are
diverted;
is
that
about
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
granzotto.
mr.
casey,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now
the
case
is
submitted.
