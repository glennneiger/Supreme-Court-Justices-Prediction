mr.
thomas
l.
casey
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
a
series
of
cases
involving
fourth
amendment
challenges
to
various
traffic-checking
procedures,
the
court
has
applied
a
balancing
test
which
weighs
the
public
interest
against
the
right
of
individuals
to
be
free
from
arbitrary
interference.
in
these
cases,
the
court
recognized
that
different
procedures
involve
different
balances
and
different
constitutional
safeguards.
for
example,
probable
cause
is
required
for
a
search
of
a
vehicle
either
by
a
roving
patrol
or
at
a
fixed
checkpoint.
a
seizure
of
an
automobile
by
a
roving
patrol
is
permissible
if
it
is
based
on
reasonable
suspicion,
and
in
martinez-fuerte
the
court
held
that
seizure
of
an
automobile
at
a
fixed
checkpoint
is
permissible
without
individualized
suspicion
if
there
are
neutral
and
objective
guidelines
which
limit
the
discretion
of
officers
in
the
field
and
limit
the
nature
of
the
intrusion.
the
case
today
presents
no
new
legal
issues.
the
only
question
is
whether
michigan's
temporary
sobriety
checkpoints
are
like
the
roving
patrols
in
delaware
v.
prouse
or,
as
we
argue,
are
more
like
the
fixed
checkpoints
in
martinez-fuerte
in
which
no
individualized
suspicion
is
required.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
complaint
was
filed
before
any
sobriety
checkpoints
had
been
operated.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
believe
they
do.
the
case--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
case
was
brought
under
the
michigan
declaratory
judgment
action
by
the
plaintiffs
in
their
capacity
as
licensed
drivers
in
the
state
of
michigan
who
allege
that
if
sobriety
checkpoints
were
operated
there
was
a
very
great
likelihood
that
they
would
be
subject
to
the
checkpoints.
we
agree.
if
the
checkpoints
were
operated,
these
individual
plaintiffs
would
be
subjected
to
them.
we
think
there
is
a
sufficient
case
or
controversy
to
confer
standing
in
both
the
state
courts
and
in
this
court,
even
without
waiting
for
a
particular
operation
of
the
checkpoint.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
in
that
case,
the--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--the
likelihood
of
any
individual
citizen
being
subjected
to
that
police
tactic
is
not
as
high
as
the
likelihood
that
individual
citizens
in
michigan
will
be
subjected
to
sobriety
checkpoints.
so
we
think
our
case...
the
plaintiffs
do
have
sufficient
standing
to
permit
the
court
to
address
this
question
as
a
facial
constitutional
challenge
without
waiting
for
an
individual
to
be
arrested
and
then
tried
as
applied
to
him.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes,
that's
quite
clear.
there
was
no
challenge
by
us
to--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
so
far
we
are,
yes,
your
honor.
[laughter]
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
the
operation
of
the
michigan
checkpoints.
they
were
intended
to
promote
the
public
health
and
safety
by
reducing
the
appalling
number
of
deaths
and
injuries
and
the
staggering
economic
costs
caused
by
alcohol-related
traffic
crashes.
the
committee
which
drafted
the
michigan
guidelines
observed
that
in
1984
in
michigan
alone
there
were
800
deaths,
more
than
28,000
injuries
and
more
than
$350
million
in
economic
costs
caused
by
alcohol-related
traffic
crashes.
the
sobriety
checkpoints
are
intended
to
increase
the
public's
awareness
of
the
nature
and
severity
of
the
problem
of
drunk
driving.
they
are
intended
to
apprehend
people
who
are
driving
drunk
at
the
time
and
to
deter
others
from
driving
drunk
in
the
future.
the
sobriety
checkpoints
use
neutral,
objective
criteria
which
were
carefully
designed
to
minimize
the
discretion
of
the
officers
in
the
field
and
to
minimize
the
extent
of
the
intrusion.
all
oncoming
traffic
in
the
selected
location
is
alerted
by
way
of
an
extensive
series
of
signs,
flares,
lights,
traffic
cones,
officers
with
reflective
vests.
traffic
is
funneled
into
one
lane
of
traffic.
the
drivers
are
stopped
for
between
20
and
30
seconds
while
a
police
officer
approaches
the
driver,
identifies
himself
or
herself,
explains
the
nature
of
the
checkpoint
and
hands
the
driver
an
informational
brochure
and
a
public
opinion
survey
card
which
the
driver
is
requested
to
return.
if
there
are
no
visible
signs
of
intoxication,
the
driver
is
then
free
to
go
on
his
or
her
way.
if
the
officer
observes
articulable
signs
of
intoxication,
he
may
direct
the
driver
over
to
a
safe
area
for
further
investigation.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
not
necessarily.
some
people
might
be
nervous.
others
might
feel
reassured
by
the
fact
that
this
is
going
on.
in
the
maryland
study
which
our
committee
relied
on
and
examined
very
closely,
public
opinion
survey
cards
were
returned
by
the
drivers
who
went
through
the
maryland
survey,
and
i
believe
the
figure
was
87
percent
of
the
cards
which
were
returned
indicated
that
they
were
not
opposed
to
the
checkpoints,
and
90
percent
of
them
felt
that
there
was
some
deterrent
effect.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
not
necessarily.
some
drivers
may
feel
that.
we
don't
think
that
that's
the
determining
factor
in
whether
these
are
constitutional,
however.
there's
a
legitimate
and
very
serious
societal
problem
here,
and
to
some
extent
these
are
an
intrusion
on
the
motoring
public,
to
be
sure,
but
we
submit
that
they
were
very
carefully
designed
to
be
a
very
minimal
intrusion.
and
when
you
weigh
that
in
the
balance
of
the
serious
nature
of
the
problem,
we
submit
they
are
reasonable.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that
type
of
checkpoint
is
authorized
by
the
same
statute
which
authorizes
sobriety
checkpoints,
and
my
understanding
is
that
such
checkpoints
have
been
operated
on
occasion
in
the
past
but
there
is
no
standard
procedure.
they're
not
operated
very
frequently.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
doubt
if
they
could
frisk
them.
you'd
get
into
the
case
of
terry
v.
ohio
on
when
a
police
officer
can
pat
down
a
person
on
the
street.
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
the
checkpoints
are
located
at
times
and
in
places
where
there
is
a
demonstrated
history
of
alcohol-related
crashes.
all
accident
statistics
are
fed
into
a
computer,
and
the
checkpoints
are
placed
in
locations
where
there
has
been
a
history
of
accidents
or
high
arrest
rate.
in
that
instance,
the
same
type
of
balancing
test
would
apply.
you
would
have
to
look
to
the
nature
of
the
severity
of
the
problem,
the
amount
of
the
intrusion,
and
does
the
police
procedure
reasonably...
have
reasonable
effectiveness
in
addressing
the
problem.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
believe
they
are.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
the
purpose
is
a
little
different,
but
the
court
has
recognized
in
delaware
v.
prouse,
for
example,
that
the
state...
pardon
me...
the
state
has
a
very
significant
interest
in
assuring
that
drivers
are
properly
licensed
and
have
proof
of
insurance
and
registration
and
that
vehicles
have
the
required
safety
equipment.
the
nature
of
the
problem
here
is
even
more
serious
than
that.
we're
talking
about
hundreds
of
deaths
and
tens
of
thousands
of
injuries
every
year.
in
brown
v.
texas,
the
court
applied
a
balancing
test
and
discussed
several
of
the
traffic-checking
cases.
in
all
the
parties
below
in
state
courts,
we
use
the
brown
v.
texas
articulation
as
the
standard.
there,
the
court
identified
three
factors
which
go
into
weighing
whether
a
particular
procedure
is
reasonable
or
not:
the
gravity
of
the
public
concern,
the
extent
to
which
the
seizure
advances
the
public
interest
and
the
severity
of
the
interference
with
individual
liberty.
we
believe
that
the
record
in
our
case
is
sufficient
to
demonstrate
that
the
checkpoints
are
reasonable
under
all
three
of
these
factors.
the
gravity
of
the
public
concern
is
undisputed
by
plaintiffs
here.
it's
widely
recognized.
the
key
point
where
the
state
courts
went
wrong,
we
submit,
is
in
its
conclusion
that
the
checkpoints
were
not
effective
enough.
the
court
in
michigan
said
that
we
did
not
prove
a
sufficiently
high
arrest
rate,
we
did
not
prove
long-term
deterrent
effects
from
the
operation
of
the
checkpoints
and
we
did
not
prove
that
they
were
the
most
effective
method
the
police
could
use.
we
submit
that
the
state
courts
severely
distorted
the
appropriate
balancing
test
when
they
held
us
to
that
kind
of
impossible
burden.
we
think
that
in
this
context
where
you
have
a
very
serious
public
problem
and
minimal
intrusion,
all
that
the...
all
that
needs
to
be
shown
is
reasonable
effectiveness.
is
there
sufficient
basis
for
the
state
officials
reasonably
to
conclude
that
sobriety
checkpoints
would
be
reasonably
effective
in
addressing
the
drunk
driving
problem.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes,
it
is.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
that's
correct.
in
several
cases
the
court
has
articulated
standards
in
dealing
with
the
effectiveness
of
various
procedures.
in
delaware
v.
prouse--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--it
is
less
intrusive
than
a
traditional
arrest.
the
cars
are
required
to
stop
for
a
period
of
20
to
30
seconds
at
the
checkpoint.
all
cars
coming
through
in
a
certain
direction
are
required
to
stop.
in
michigan
our
checkpoint
guidelines
are
set
up
so
that
cars
can
turn
off
before
they
enter
the
check
lane,
and
on
the
one
checkpoint
which
was
operated,
i
believe
the
record
shows
that
six
cars
either
made
u-turns
or
turned
off
before
they
entered
the
checkpoint.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
the
checkpoint
guidelines
were
developed
with
every
effort
to
minimize
the
intrusion,
and
that
i
suspect
was
one
element
of
the
effort.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
it
would
be
easy
to
design
a
more
effective
checkpoint
than
we
have,
but
to
do
that
would
probably
require
a
greater
intrusion.
the
balance
that
the
michigan
officials
chose
was
to
give
as
much
weight
as
possible
to
minimizing
the
amount
of
intrusion.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
not
by
itself.
if
the
u-turn
was
done
in
a
fashion
that
violated
traffic
laws
or
if
there
was
some
erratic
driving
or
some
other
articulable
suspicion,
then
the
guidelines
say
that
that
would
be
enough
to
pursue
the
driver.
but
just
the
mere
fact
of
a
lawful
u-turn
would
not
be
enough.
under
the
martinez-fuerte
case
the
court
said
that
all
cars
coming
through
the
checkpoint
could
be
seized
and
the
officers
running
the
checkpoint
could
direct
some
cars
to
another
area
for
further
investigation
without
any
reasonable
suspicion.
our
checkpoint
is
even
more
protective
of
individual
rights
than
that.
the
officers
do
not
ask
any
questions.
drivers
are
not
required
to
show
identification.
there
is
really
no
communication
from
the
driver
required
at
all
unless
there
are
some
visible
signs
of
intoxication,
at
which
point
the
car
would
be
directed
to
a
safe
area.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
he's
not
required
to,
no.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
no,
he's
not
advised.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
there
are
many
ways
a
trained
police
officer
could
take
notice
of
articulable
facts
involving
intoxication:
uncoordinated
physical
movements,
eye
motion.
perhaps
he's
got
some
beer
in
the
car
with
him.
there
are
many
ways.
our
checkpoints
require
an
officer,
before
they
have
further
suspicion,
to
have
articulable
signs
of
intoxication.
i
believe
the
constitution
perhaps
does
not
require
even
that
high
a
standard.
in
martinez-fuerte
the
court
said
that
some
cars
could
be
directed
for
further
inquiry
without
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
not
by
itself,
no.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
it
could
be
one
of
the
factors.
in
several
cases...
in
the
ortiz
case,
for
example,
this
court
discussed
the
idea
that
a
trained
police
officer
can
observe
behavior
which
might
appear
innocent
to
an
untrained
person
and
from
that
behavior
the
trained
officer
can
make
inferences
and
deductions
which
would
form
a
basis
for
reasonable
suspicion.
that's
why
it's
so
hard
to
say
that
any
one
factor
would
or
would
not
be
the
deciding
factor.
there
are
command
officers
on
the
scene
who
are
involved
in
the
decision
whether
to
send
a
driver
off
for
further
investigation.
it's
not
up
to
the
individual
officer
in
the
field,
and
it
is
structured
by
the
guidelines
themselves.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
there
are
several
police
cars
to
be
stationed
before
and
after
the
checkpoint,
so
a
car
could
turn
and
follow
a
car
that
made
a
lawful
u-turn,
yes.
the
case
we
principally
rely
on,
of
course,
is
the
martinez-fuerte
case.
we
think
our
checkpoints
are
constitutionally
indistinguishable
from
the
checkpoints
there.
the
goal
is
different
here.
it's
to
prevent
drunk
driving
and
prevent
the
harms
that
drunk
driving
cause--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--in
that
it
was
a
fixed
checkpoint
which
was
permanently
based.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
there
is
general--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--there
is
general
publicity
given
to
the
general
area.
let's
say
in
saginaw
county
there
will
be
one,
and
the
press
would
be
advised
of
that.
but
as
to
the
specific
location
on
a
specific
street,
no,
that
would
not
be.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
don't
believe
it
does.
martinez
did
not
have
that
aspect.
that
is
really
the
only
factual
difference.
we
submit
that
while
our
checkpoints
are
in
operation,
however,
they
operate
the
same
as
martinez-fuerte.
drivers
are
given
sufficient
notice.
they
are
not
surprised.
there
are
the
signs
for
up
to
half
a
mile
in
advance.
there
is
the
opportunity
to
turn
off.
there
is
no
basis
for
the
trial
court's
finding
that
there
would
be
fear
or
surprise
in
the
motorists.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
and--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--in
the
general
area.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
correct.
if
we
did
not
have
that,
it
would
greatly
diminish
the
deterrent
aspect.
if
every
driver
knew
where
it
was
going
to
be,
it
would
be
easy
to
avoid.
so,
again,
we've
tried
to
balance
the
effectiveness
against
the
intrusion.
i
want
to
save
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal,
but
i
just
want
to
emphasize
that
we're
asserting
that
the
proper
balance
test
here
shows
that
this
is
a
serious
problem.
it
is
reasonably
effective,
and
it
is
minimally
intrusive.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
i
have
nothing
further
to
add,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
no,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
the
testimony
that
he's
referring
to--
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
--that
statement
is
not
accurate.
one...
in
one
sentence
in
a
deposition,
one
of
the
deputies
on
a
cross-examination
said
that
there
could
be
reliance
on
any
number
of
factors
or
perhaps
no
factor.
that's
not
what
the
law
says.
that's
not
what
this
court's
cases
say.
that's
not
what
our
guidelines
say.
that's
not
the
law
in
michigan.
if
a
driver
is
pulled
over
for
further
investigation
for
no
reason
whatsoever,
they
would
be
able
to
challenge
that
on
an
individual
as-applied
basis.
under
the
guidelines
and
the
way
the
michigan
program
is
set
up,
drivers
cannot
be
diverted
for
further
questioning
unless
there
are
visible,
articulable
signs
of
intoxication.
mr.
thomas
l.
casey
yes.
