justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
casey,
this
action
was
brought
as
a
facial
challenge
of
some
kind
to
the
program?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case
are
simply
citizens
who
drive
in
michigan?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
one
was
a
plaintiff
named
in
the
case
who
had
been
stopped
at
a
checkpoint?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
plaintiffs
have
standing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
michigan
use
any
kind
of
checkpoints
for
vehicle
safety
check
requirements?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
there
were
a
situation
in
a
particular
area,
for
example,
in
the
city
of
detroit,
with
high
crime
and
a
great
many
shootings.
do
you
suppose
that
michigan
could
set
up
a
pedestrian
checkpoint
and
frisk
people
for
weapons?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
casey,
in
martinez-fuerte
were
the
motorists
aware
or
generally
advised
of
the
location
of
the
checkpoint?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
people
would
have
reason
to
know
where
it
was.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
i
guess
in
michigan
that's
not
the
case.
you
wouldn't
know
as
a
motorist--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--where
it
would
be
set
up?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
that
make
a
difference
in
the
constitutional
balance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
drug
traffic?
i
suppose
you
would
take
the
position
that
that's
an
equally
serious
national
problem.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
can
the
government
set
up
stop-and-frisk
points
for
pedestrians
in
drug
use
areas
of
cities?
