mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
join
in
mr.
casey's
analysis
of
the
legal
principles
that
govern
this
case,
but
if
the
court
please,
i
will
focus
first
on
those
features
of
the
problem
of
drunk
driving
in
this
country
that
have
made
it
so
resistant
to
traditional
law
enforcement
techniques
and
on
some
of
the
reasons
why
sobriety
checkpoints
have
been
widely
recognized
as
the
important
elements
of
effective
drunk
driving
programs.
mr.
casey
indicated
there
has
been
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
problem
of
drinking
and
driving
is
a
very
serious
one.
it
is
important,
nevertheless,
to
pause
for
purposes
of
the
court's
balancing
test
and
to
appreciate
just
how
grave
that
interest
is.
if
one
were
to
prepare
a
list
of
the
most
important
and
serious
threats
to
public
health
and
safety
in
this
country,
drunk
driving
would
have
to
be
at
or
near
the
top
of
the
list.
in
1988,
47,000
people
were
killed
in
traffic
crashes
in
this
country.
of
the
roughly
62,000
drivers
involved,
25
percent
were
intoxicated
legally
at
the
time
of
the
accident.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
i
believe
that
there
were
more
people
killed
in
traffic
crashes,
your
honor,
than
there
were
in...
by
murder.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
well,
in...
25
percent
of
the
drivers
involved
are
legally
intoxicated.
in
the
case
of
50
percent
of
the
fatalities,
alcohol
is
involved,
and
that
refers
to--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--i
believe
that
the
number
of
murders
in
the
country...
and
this
is
a
rough
recollection
of
something
i
read
along
the
way...
is
on
the
order
of
20,000.
it's
a--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--host
of
very
serious
problems.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
it's
certainly
a
very
serious
national
problem,
yes.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
you
honor,
a
frisk
is
a
much
more
intrusive
form
of
interference
with
4th
amendment
interests
than
a
traffic
stop.
a
traffic
stop
is
a
well-accepted
form
of
intrusion.
in
the
martinez-fuerte
case
the
court
noted
that
it
was
a
well-established
practice.
its
utility
had
been
accepted
as
an
incident
of
travel
on
the
roads,
and
it
is
a
very,
very
minimal
interference
with
fourth
amendment
interests.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
no,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
think
so.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
that's
true,
driving
is
a
very
highly
regulated
activity
in
this
country,
in
keeping
with
the
risk
that
it
presents
to
others
on
the
road.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
i
believe
that
at
least
under
the
department
of
transportation's
guidelines,
as
a
result
of
recent
regulation,
that
drug
use
and
alcohol
use
are
treated
the
same.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
right...
yes,
your
honor,
and
also
in
the
concurring
opinion
that
you
wrote,
i
believe.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
i
would
think
not,
justice
scalia,
in
this
sense:
in
a
number
of
the
court's
cases
you
have
had
to
assess,
necessarily,
the
deterrent
effect
of
various
programs.
in
the
mackey
v.
montran
case,
which
involved
whether
drivers
could
have
their
licenses
suspended
for
refusals
to
take
breathalyzer
or
blood
alcohol
test,
the
court
indicated
that
they
had
a
significant
deterrent
effect.
in
the
burger
case,
there
was
discussion
about
the
deterrent
value
that
would
be
lost
if
warrants
were
required
for
the
sorts
of
searches
that
were
involved
there.
and
it
is
a
common
element
of
the
court's
decisions
in
this
area,
both
to
consider
the
deterrent
effect
of
programs
and
all
other--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--well,
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
the
sort
of
trial
record
that
was
developed
here.
this
is
not
a
record
that
gauges
the
effect
of
this
particular
program
in
action.
this
is
a
record
that
focuses
on
the
potential
of
the
program.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
that's
true,
your
honor...
not
necessarily
true
that
i
could
have
tried
it
better,
but
it's
certainly
true
the
state
had
an
opportunity
to
put
in
the
evidence.
the
issue
really
is...
i
think
the
approach
the
court
must
take
in
this
area
results
from
the
generality
of
the
court's
holdings.
i
mean,
were
the
court
to
take
this
situation...
were
the
court
to
say
that
this
presents
only
an
issue
of
fact,
the
effect
of
the
court's
decision
would
be
limited
to
these
two
parties
as
of
this
time,
and
the
court
has
never
viewed
its
role
in
the
fourth
amendment
area
as
limited.
so--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--well,
that's
certainly
true,
but
i
think
in
this
case
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
a
conclusion
on
the
part
of
the
state
authorities
that
this
is
a
potentially
effective
means
of
reducing
drinking
and
driving.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
in
this
case,
your
honor,
two
people
were--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--i
think
that--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--because
the
test
is
not
that
searching
at
this
stage,
where
the
issue
is
the
base
of
the
program
against
a
background
of
a
very
minimal
intrusion
on
privacy
and
very,
very
constrained
limits
on
discretion.
there
are
good
reasons--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--i
believe
that
you
look--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--i
believe
that
the
statistics
demonstrate...
confirm
what
common
sense
suggests
in
this
area.
in
other
words,
one
knows--
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
--i
think
you
may
look
at
them,
yes.
these
are
legislative
facts
involved
here,
facts...
ordinarily,
the
court
reviews...
takes
a
measure
of
the
deterrence,
and
in
this
case
we
believe
that
you
can
look
at
the
statistics
to
educate
common
sense.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
there
was
one
checkpoint
operated.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
for
about
an
hour.
126
cars
were
stopped.
one
driver
ran
the
checkpoint;
one
was
referred
to
the
safe
area...
two
were
referred
to
the
same
area,
one
of
whom
was
found
to
be
intoxicated
and
was
arrested.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
that's
correct.
the
complaint
was
filed
before
the
first
checkpoint
was
operated
and
then
the
program
was
enjoined
after
only
a
single
checkpoint
had
been
run.
mr.
stephen
l.
nightingale
now,
why...
getting
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
why
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
court
to
put
a
program
like
this
in
place,
experience
demonstrates
that
only
between
one
in
200
and
one
in
2,000
drunk
drivers
can
be
apprehended
on
an
average
weekend
night,
and
therefore
it's
been
the
focus
of
efforts
to
improve
on
the
situation
in
this
area,
to
achieve
more
visibility,
to
achieve
a
more
impressive
reminder
of
the
state's
commitment
to
curbing
drunk
driving.
thank
you
very
much.
