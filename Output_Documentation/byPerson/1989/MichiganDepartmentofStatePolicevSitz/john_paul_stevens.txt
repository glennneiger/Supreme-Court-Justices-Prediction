paul

is
it
agreed
that
that...
this
is
a
seizure?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
agreed
that
it
may...
it...
and
the
argument's
whether
it
can
be
done
without
any
articulable
suspicion,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
driver
required
to
roll
the
window
down?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
he
advised
that
he
doesn't
have
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
if
he
didn't,
how
would
you
ever
find
him?
you
can't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
standard
procedure
is
an
officer
stationed
in
a
place
where
he
can
follow
someone
who
makes
a
u-turn?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
nightingale,
going
back
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
is
the
problem
any
less
serious
with
regard
to
firearms?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
only
25
percent
of
those
are
alcohol
related,
i
thought
you
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
guns
compare?
how
do
firearm...
danger
compare
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
pretty
serious
problem,
too,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
have
we
done
it
in
cases
when
the
trial
court
has
reviewed
evidence
on
the
issue
and
their
record
has
been
developed?
have
we
said,
well,
that's
just
a
starting
point,
we'll
go
off
on
our
own
and
figure
out
what
evidence
we
can
find
on
our
own?
i
know
we've
done
it
in
cases
of
a
facial
attack
and
no
evidence
at
all
on
the
trial
record,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--whatever
the
record
was
is
what
the
state
put
in
in
order
to
justify
the
program.
they
had
an
ample
opportunity
to
put
everything
in
they
wanted,
didn't
they?
maybe
you
could
have
tried
the
case
better,
but
you
didn't
try
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
never
viewed
our
role
as
just
deciding
the
case
or
controversy
that's
brought
to
us
for
decision,
i
suppose.
