justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
police
department
has
a
policy
of
applying
choke
holds
to
people
resisting
arrest.
would...
would
any
citizen
have
standing
to
challenge
that
practice?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
the
theory
that
he
might
be
arrested
and
the
choke
hold
applied
to
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
government
cannot
insist
that
you
have
a
license
to
walk
along
the
sidewalk,
can
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
does
have
the
right
to
insist
that
you
have
a
license
to
drive.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
not
inconceivable
that
you
might
have
a
traffic
stop
not
just
for
intoxication,
but
for
drug
use.
does
this
to
seek
to
find
out
the
drug
use
as
well,
this
program,
or
is
it
just
alcohol?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
decide
how
effective
this
is?
i
suppose
that
goes
into
a
reasonableness
calculation.
how
does
the
court
make
that
judgment?
are
we
limited
to
the
record
in
the
trial
court
here,
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
all
it
takes,
a
reasonable
basis
in
order
to
make
the
weighing
of
whether
this
is
a
reasonable
intrusion
of
privacy
or
not?
suppose
i
disagree
with
the
state.
suppose
i
think...
it
seems
to
me,
if
you
took
these
17
law
enforcement
officers,
however
many
were
used
in
this
stop,
and
just
set
them
out
on
the
roads
to
look
for
people
weaving,
you
would
do
a
lot
more
good
than
having
sit
at
this
traffic
stop
for
a
number
of
hours
and...
what
did
they
pick
up,
2
percent
of
the
people
that
went
through?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
i
think
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
i
have
to
say
well,
the
legislature
might
have
thought
otherwise?
why
can't
i
just
say,
in
my
view
it
is
unreasonable
to
do
it
this
way,
you
should
do
it
another
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
granzotto,
what...
what
do
you
do
about
truck
checkpoints
on...
which
exist
on
many
state
highways,
requiring
trucks
to
pull
over
to
determine
whether
they're
overloaded
and
whether
their
safety
equipment
is
operational?
justice
antonin
scalia
well...
well,
okay,
i'll
make
up
one.
it's
criminal.
if...
if...
if
they
catch
your
truck
with
too
much
weight
on
it,
you're
going
to
be
cited
criminally,
or
with
unsafe
brakes.
justice
antonin
scalia
heavily
regulated
industry...
i
don't
know.
you
need
a
driver's
license
and
a
truck
driver's
license,
just
as
you
need
a
car
driver's
license
for
a
car.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
circular.
since...
since
the
weigh
stations
exist,
it's
a
heavily
regulated
industry,
which
justifies
the
weigh
stations.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
granzotto,
would
it
have
made
a
difference
if
these
weren't
stops
along
the
way,
but
if
these
were...
suppose
they
set
up
at
the...
at
the
entrance
to...
to
michigan
highways?
checkpoints
at
which
they
would
check
your
car
headlights
before
you
were
allowed
on
it,
the
brakes
and...
and
the
sobriety
of
the
driver?
or
suppose
they
do
it
at
a
toll
booth
on
a
state...
on
a
state
toll
road?
when
you
come
up
to
the
toll
booth
they
check
your...
the
safety
of
the
car
and
the
safety
of
the
driver,
is
that
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
hard
to
separate
the
one
from
the
other.
i
mean,
it's
the
same
at
the
truck
stops.
they're
doing
two
things.
if
you
are
there
in
violation
of
the
law,
you'll
be
penalized.
but
they
want
to
get
you
off
the
road,
also.
isn't
that
the
purpose
of
these
stops?
i
mean
you
say
it
has
a
purely
criminal
purpose.
well,
it
isn't
just
to...
to
put
you
in
jail
for
a
violation;
it's
to
get
you
off
the
road
because
you're
drunk.
isn't
that
a
separate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
likewise,
in
the
case
i
just
spoke
about,
when
they're
checking
you
to
get
on
the
road.
you...
you
mean
it
would
be
okay
if
they
check
your
brakes
and
found
the
brakes
were
no
good
and
said,
you
can't
get
on
the
road,
go
in
peace,
and
you
go
home?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
they
arrest
you
for
bad
brakes,
then
it
becomes
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
casey,
excuse
me.
i
do
have
a
question.
do
you
agree
with
the
statement
that
was
just
made
that
these
parties
at
the
roadblock
could
be
pulled
over
for
further
investigation
for
any
reason
or
for
no
reason?
was
that
the
way
this
was
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
that...
that
bears
upon
the
scope
of
intrusion.
i
had
thought
up
to
now
that
all
we're
talking
about
the
degree
of
intrusion
is
being
stopped.
if
what...
if
that
statement
is
true,
the
degree
of
intrusion
without
articulable
suspicion
could
be
as
much
as
getting
out
of
your
car
and
having
to
walk
a
line
and
do
all
the
other
tests
that
they
perform.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
appears
in
the
text
of
the
guidelines?
