justice
scalia
excuse
me.
that...
that
means
that
the
only
way
a
statute
can
ever
be
narrowed,
the
only
way
you
can
ever
give
a
narrowing
construction
to
a
statute
is
to
have
a
prosecution
of
someone
who...
who
is
not
smart
enough
to
challenge
it
facially
on
constitutional
grounds,
or
perhaps
who
is,
but
the
court...
the
court
throws
out
the
case
against
that
defendant,
because
the
statute
really
doesn't
mean
what
it
seems
to
mean.
is
that
the
only
way
you
can
get
a
narrowing
construction?
you
see,
i'm
worried
about
what
you're
saying.
i
don't
understand
how
it...
how...
how
can
state
courts
given
narrowing
constructions,
then,
if,
whenever
they
give
one,
the
defendant
gets
off?
then
it's
not
a
holding.
then
it's
not
a
holding
at
all,
it's
just
dictum.
justice
scalia
and
all
the
rest
is
dictum?
justice
scalia
no,
the...
the
court
then
goes
on
and
says,
but,
if
you
bring
us
another
defendant,
right--
justice
scalia
--under
this
same
statute,
in
the
future,
this
is
how
we
would
interpret
it.
and
that
new
defendant
is
on...
is
on
notice.
isn't
that...
all
that
dictum?
justice
scalia
it's
a
possession
statute,
right?
justice
scalia
well,
is
it...
is
it
clear
that
we
would
apply
the
overbreadth
doctrine
to
this?
is...
what
is...
what
is
the
expression?
what
is
the
first
amendment
expression
protected
by
this?
justice
scalia
he's
not
expressing
this
photograph
to
anybody,
it's...
it's
his
own
photograph,
he
could
have
taken
it
himself
for
his
own
delight,
right?
justice
scalia
to
yourself?
justice
scalia
if
there
were
restrictions
upon
the
distribution
of
that
book
to
you,
those
restrictions
would
relate
to
the
first
amendment,
to
communication.
but
if
the
restriction
is
just
something
you
do
in
the
privacy
of
your
own
room,
i
don't
see
how
that's
a
first
amendment
communication
interest
and
how
the
overbreadth
doctrine
would
even
apply
to
it.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
i
think
having...
having
sexual
relations
with
a...
with...
with
a
minor
under...
what
is
it,
under...
15
is
the
age?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
i
assume
that
if
you
didn't
make
15
the
age,
or
you
would...
you
might
be
convicting
many
18-year-olds
for
having
sexual
relations
with...
with
17-year-olds.
that's
quite
a
different
interest
in
protecting
minors
than
the
interest
in
protecting
minors
from
being
used
as
the...
as
the
subject
matter
of
pornographic
distributions.
i
mean,
isn't
that...
isn't
that
a
different
interest?
justice
scalia
i'm
saying
the
activity
is
different
from
being
in
the
career
of
portraying
the
activity.
you
can
think
it
is
worse
to
bring
a
child
into
the
career
of
being
a
porno
star
than
you
can
think
it
is
to
have
sexual
relations
with
a
child
on
one
occasion.
isn't...
isn't
that
quite
a
different
thing?
justice
scalia
xxx
but
the
evil
at
which
it's
directed
is
that.
i
mean
the
state
asserts
that
the
only
way
to
dry
up
all
of
these
things,
to
dry
up
that
kind
of
activity,
child...
the
child
pornography
business,
is
to
simply
make
it
illegal
to...
to
have
this
kind
of
material,
just...
just
as
you
stop,
you
know,
elephant
poaching
by
making
it
illegal
to
have
ivory.
justice
scalia
mr.
o'brien,
what
do
you
do
about
the
overbreadth
contention
that...
i
mean
the...
the
defense's
argument
here
is
that
mr.
osborne
had
every
reason
to
read
this
statute
and
say,
that's
a
ridiculous
statute;
it's...
it's
just
too
broad.
you
mean
somebody
can't
have
a
picture
of
a
nude
child?
you
know,
what
about
parents?
obviously,
the
statute
is
too
broad,
since
it's
too
broad,
i
know
the
supreme
court
law,
it's...
well,
it
can't
be
imposed
against
me.
what
do
you
do
about
that?
justice
scalia
oh,
i'm
sure
he
knows
that.
but
that's
often
the
case
when
a
defendant
is
prosecuted
under...
that's
what
the
overbreadth
statute
means,
even
if
you're
in
the
core
of
what
the
legislature
was
obviously
directing
its
guns
at,
if
they've...
if
they've
drawn
too...
too
wide
a...
an
area,
it's
too
bad.
justice
scalia
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you're
saying.
are
you
saying
that
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
he
had
sufficient
notice?
and
that
so
long
as...
as
a
court
narrows
the
statute
when
it's
brought
before
it
for
construction,
the
only
question
presented
is
whether
the
defendant
had
sufficient
notice
that
what
he
was
doing
was
unlawful?
justice
scalia
i
know
it's
one
of
them.
what...
is
it
the
only
one?
if
it
isn't
the
only
one,
then...
then
the
other
one
is,
was
it
overbroad?
justice
scalia
it
was?
justice
scalia
but
for
a
person
who
is
confronted
with
that
statute,
ex
ante,
before
the
supreme
court
has
adopted
that
construction,
for
him
to
be
bound
by
it,
surely
he
has
to
be
able,
reasonably,
to
predict
that
kind
of
construction?
justice
scalia
well,
wouldn't
you
go
further
than
that
and
say
that
the
state
must
also
put
in
the...
those
elements
of
the
statute
as
part
of
its
case,
which
you
didn't
do?
you
didn't
show
intent--
justice
scalia
the
case
is
so
obvious
we
don't
really
need
a
jury
trial?
justice
scalia
that's,
in
essence,
what
the
appeals
court
is
saying,
right?
justice
scalia
the
jury
never
found
it,
but
it's
so
obvious
that
any
jury
could
find
it.
i
mean
we
could
get
rid
of
a
lot
of
jury
trials
that
way.
justice
scalia
but
the
jury
was
never
asked
to
find
it,
and
the
jury
never
did
find
it,
did
it?
justice
scalia
the
jury
never
found
it?
justice
scalia
not--
--he's
contending
at
least
that
the
jury...
that
the
jury
didn't
find
that
he
knew
those
things?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
is
that
before
or
after
the--
justice
scalia
--after
the
construction.
