mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
ohio
has
adopted
a
comprehensive
statutory
scheme
dealing
with
child
pornography,
which
deals
with
production,
distribution
and
possession,
and
it
goes
on
a
continuum
from
material
that
is
involving
a
minor,
whether
the
material
is
obscene
under
miller,
to
material
that
depicts
sexual
conduct,
typically
vaginal
intercourse,
anal
or
oral
intercourse,
and
then
finally,
what's
involved
in
this
case,
material
that
depicts
child-oriented
nudity.
the
ohio
supreme
court,
and
prior
to
that,
the
tenth
district
court
of
appeals...
we
have
ten
ohio
appellate
judges
looking
at
this
statute,
and
all
of
them
concluding
and
giving
a
proper
narrowing
construction...
the
statute...
when
you
consider
the
entire
scheme
in
pari
materia,
when
you
consider
the
exceptions
and
exemptions
is...
is
directed
at
the
lewd
exhibition
or
the
graphic
focus
on
the
genitals.
ferber
itself
in
the
new
york
statute
in
question
in
ferber
permits,
as
a
description
of
unprotected
speech
as
child
pornography,
lewd
exhibition
of
the
genitals.
it's
the
state's
position
that
the
statute,
both
on
its
face
and
as
applied,
was...
was
constitutional
with
respect
to
the
defendant
osborne.
the
statute
itself,
when
you...
when
you
read
it,
and
the
ohio
courts
made
this
clear,
is
directed
at
the
kind
of
material
the
court
was
concerned
with
in
ferber
and
found
that
to
be
unprotected
speech.
ohio,
along
with
18
other
states,
has
also
concluded
that
you
need
to
address
this
problem
not
just
with
respect
to
production,
not
just
with
respect
to
distribution,
but
it's
also
necessary
to
get
to
the
point
of
prohibiting
possession
of
material
that
fits...
fits
the
definition,
and
that
possession
follows
a
continuum
in
those
three
state
statutes,
not
only
with
respect
to
the
lewd
exhibition
of
the
genitals,
but
also
with
respect
to
the
obscene
and/or
the
actual
sexual
conduct
depicted
in
the...
in
the
materials.
the
state
thinks
that
the
defendant
in
this
court
is
extending
what
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
should
be
viewed
narrowly,
and
that
is
the...
the
stanley
decision
from
1969.
stanley
obviously
predated
ferber,
and
the
court,
i
think,
when
the
court
factors
in
the
ferber
decision
with
stanley,
and
looking
at
stanley
itself,
it
said,
where...
where
compelling
reasons
exist,
the
state
can
enter
into
the
home
and
prohibit
certain
possessory
offenses
involving
printed,
filmed
or
recorded
material.
that
this
case
is
an
exception
to
stanley
in
that
regard,
that
this...
this
case
is
a
case
that
does
present
compelling
reasons,
as
the
court
recognized
in
the...
in
the
subsequent
ferber
decision.
the
child
pornography
in
question,
and
i
think
the
record
in
this
case
amply
reflects
we're
not
talking
about
mere
nudity
here,
we're
talking
about
almost
gymnastic
poses
with
a
young
man,
which
the
defendant
admitted,
and
i
think
in
response
to
one
of
justice
blackmun's
questions,
we
should
point
out
the
evidence
of
the
defendant's
knowledge
of
this
young
man...
young
man's
age,
apart
from
just
looking
at
the
photographs
themself,
was
the
defendant's
admission
that
when
they
were
given
to
him,
he
was
told
the
boy
was
14.
on
the
back
of
state's
exhibit
1d
there
is
a
notation
that
says
tommy-13>
["].
so
the
evidence
was
clear
with
respect,
apart
from
looking
at
the
photograph,
that
the
evidence
was
clear
that
it
is
a
young
man.
it
is
the
kind
of
material
the
court,
and
i
think
the
18
states
in
addition
to
ohio
that
have
prohibited
possession,
is
concerned
about.
the
gymnastic-type
poses
involved
in
this
case
concentrate
graphically
on
the
stretched
anal
area
of
the
boy,
the
boy
having
a...
all
parts
of
his
body
exposed,
his
genitalia
turgid...
how
the
defendant
himself
described
it.
in
one
of
the
photographs
there
is
a
dildo
which...
which
the
defendant
admitted
he
recognized
as
a
dildo,
which
is
placed
to
the
man's
anus.
so
i
think
when
the
defendant...
appellant
in
this
court
describes
the
statute
as
dealing
with
mere
nudity,
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
it
in
the
context
of
the
material
that
he
was
prosecuted
for
possessing,
and
that
material
i
think
clearly
is
within
the
confines
of
ferber.
and
when
we
look
at
the
state
interest
that
justifies
going
into
the
home,
prohibiting
that
possession,
and
i
think
i
agree
with
justice
scalia
when
he
made
reference
to.
we're
not
talking
about
pure
speech,
we're
not
talking
about
core
first
amendment
expressive
type
of
conduct,
we're
talking
about
a
possessory
offense
dealing
with
certain
kind
of
material
that
has
the
visual
depictions
of
the
minor
engaged
in
this
kind
of
specified
sexual
conduct,
or
the
lewd
exhibition
of
the
genitals.
and
i--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--well,
i
think,
justice...
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
defendant,
or
anyone
else
like
him,
looking
at
this
statute,
even
before
the
ohio
supreme
court
construed
it
could
look
at
that
the
continuum
i
mentioned
earlier,
look
also
specifically
at
this
statute
that
prohibits
the
possession
of
nudity-oriented
material,
except
under
the
following
circumstances,
and
the
statute
itself
sets
forth
the
kinds
of
circumstances
that
would
be
exempted
or
accepted.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
knew
that
the
kind
of
material
he
possessed
is
the
kind
of
material
the
statute
was
directed...
directed
at.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
well,
i
think
the...
the
ohio
supreme
court,
in
addressing
that,
is
how
i
believe
i
should
respond,
and
that
is
looking
at
the
statute
as
a
whole,
and
looking
at
the
exemptions
and
exceptions
in
there,
that
it
did
give
fair
notice,
fair
warning
to
mr.
osborne
and
others
that
this
is
the
kind
of
material
that
it
was
designed
to
address,
and
not
just
mere
nudity.
otherwise,
there
is
no
reason
for
the
legislature
to
have
inserted
in
the
statute
the
exceptions
and
exemptions
for
artistic,
medical,
proper...
other
proper
purposes
that
are
in
the
statute
itself.
otherwise
there's
no
reason
for
them
to
be
in
there
if
the
defendant
would
take
it
to
mean
we're
only
dealing
with
mere
nudity,
which
obviously
is
not
the
type
of
conduct
that
can
be
proscribed,
mere
nudity.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
not
the
only
question,
but
i
think
it's
one
of
the
questions
that
would
be
before
the
court,
and
i
think
that
the
court
would
say,
looking
at
the--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--well,
i
think
the
court
would
ask...
yes,
it
was
overbroad
on
its
face
before
it
was
construed
by
the
state
court.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
correct.
and
i
think
the
court
addressed
that
in
oakes
last
year,
that
the
defendant
may
raise
the
defense,
that
doesn't
mean
that
he
wins
when
he
raises
that
overbreadth
defense.
and
it--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--well,
that
was
a
legislative
mooting,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
i
think
if
that
is
done
here
that,
looking
at
the
statute
as...
as
originally
written,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
consider
the
proper
purposes,
exceptions
and
the
other
exceptions
and
exemptions
in
the
statute,
and
the
entire
statutory
scheme,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
not
overbroad,
even
before
the
narrowing
construction.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
well,
i
think
that
would
leave
us,
if
a...
if
a
majority
of
the
court
thinks
the
statute
as
written
prior
to
being
narrowed
is
overbroad,
at
least
five
members
of
the
court
in
the
oakes
case
would
say
that
the
statute
was
a
nullity
from
the
beginning
and
that
it
is
a
proper
method
to
say
the
defendant's
conduct
was
lawful
at
the
time
committed,
and
therefore
can
raise
that
overbreadth
defense
and
have
the
conviction
reversed.
and
it
would;
i
suspect,
also
result
in
the
defendant's
discharge
if
that's
the
court's
view.
i
think
the
court
would--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--i...
i
think,
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
even
if
the
court
would
look
at
the
overbreadth
argument
and
say
it's
invalid
on
its
face,
the
conduct
was
lawful,
the
statute
not
applicable,
that
the
defendant
may
be
entitled
to
have
the
conviction
reversed,
and
be
retried,
but
not
discharged.
i
think
i
would
make
the
distinction
between
a
reversal
of
the
conviction
with
a
remand
for
a
new
trial,
as
opposed
to
a
reversal
of
the
conviction
and
a
discharge
by
the
defendant,
because
the
statute
was
invalid
on
its
face
and...
in
toto,
in...
right
from
the
beginning.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
that's
what
my
position
is,
your
honor,
they
took
a
statute,
not
only
the
ohio
supreme
court,
but--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--correct.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
i
believe
that's...
that's
my
view
of
what
they
did.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
that's...
that's
my
view
of
what
they
did,
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
was
a
proper
and
rational
decision
by
them,
looking
at
the
statute,
what...
what
its
purposes
are
in
the
context
of
all
the
statutes
that
deal
in
this
area,
together
with
what
the
legislature
was
trying
to
get
at,
including
the
exceptions
and
exemptions.
i
don't
think
any
other
conclusion
could
have
been
reached
by
them
or
any
other
reasonable
person.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
i...
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
and
i
think
looking
at
the
ohio
statute
in
this
case,
that
the
defendant
could
reasonably
predict
that
the
kind
of
material
we
were
trying
to
proscribe
was
not
"mere
nudity",
but
was
that
which
was
something
more
than
mere
nudity.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
i
think--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--well,
i
think
i
would
make
a
distinction
as
to...
as
to
whether
the
state
proved
it
and
whether
there
was
a
jury
instruction
on
it.
the
state
clearly
proved
there
was
a
lewd
exhibition
of
the
genitals
by
virtue
of
marking,
identifying
and
having...
admitting
into
evidence
the
photographs
themselves,
which
speak
for
themselves.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
the
jury
wasn't
charged
on
that,
and
the
ohio
supreme
court,
i
think,
your
honor,
addressed
that
by
saying,
we
agree
that
jury
was
not
charged
on
this
issue,
we
are
not
going
to
relieve
the
state
from
that
burden.
we
will
look
at
this
material,
and
it's
clear,
beyond
per
adventure,
when
you
look
at
the
material,
we're
dealing
with
a
lewd
exhibition
of
the
genitals.
had
the
jury
been
charged
in
that
regard,
the
jury
could
not
have
come
to
any
other
conclusion.
therefore,
using
the
plain
error
doctrine,
or
harmless
error,
that
it
was
not
reversible
error--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
well,
i
don't
think
that's
what
happened
in
this
case,
your
honor.
i
think
what...
what
was
presented
to...
to
the
jury
and
i...
i
must
say
that--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--no--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--no,
your...
no,
justice
scalia,
they
did
not.
but
i
think
the...
the
plain
error
doctrine,
in
that
instance,
the
court
will
say
that
unless
the
manifest
miscarriage
of
justice
will
occur,
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
addressed
that
in
this
case,
that...
and
i
assume
that
had
they
felt
that
a
manifest
miscarriage
of
justice
would
occur
if
the
defendant's
conviction
would
be
affirmed
under
those
circumstances--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--the
defendant
did
not
request
a
scienter
intent
charge
or
did
not
request
a
limiting
instruction
with
respect
to
the
lewd
exhibition
of
the
genitals
that
was
later
the
narrowing
construction
by
the
ohio
supreme
court.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
i...
i
read
it,
justice
white,
as
saying
that
we
are
construing
this
statute,
and
this
is
what
it
meant
when
it
was
enacted
and
when
it
was
adopted,
and
that's
what
it's
directed
at.
and...
and
that's...
that's
how
i
read
the
decision,
and
they
were
not
doing
anything
other
than
construing
that
statute
in
that
regard.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
in
my
view
it
is,
because
in
a
tradition
of
common
law,
the
courts,
on
appeal,
have
that
option
of
construing
statute,
and
i
think
it's
different
than
a
subsequent
legislative
amendment
changing
the
elements
of
the
offense,
particularly
with
respect
to
what
happened
in
oakes.
i
would
make
that
distinction.
i
think,
with
respect--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--and
when
you
say
intent,
you
mean
regarding
a
lewd
exhibition
of
the
genitals
or--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--if
the
defendant
had
requested
it
and
it
had
been
denied,
i
would
agree
there
would
be
a
problem,
yes.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
i
think
it's
different
from
what
we
have
here
because
at
first
the
defendant
didn't
request
it,
and...
and
[inaudible].
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
well,
i
guess,
just
in
my
own
mind,
in
terms
of
making
a
record,
i
would...
i
would
think
the
defendant
would
be
better
off
had
that
requested
instruction
been
made,
had
it
been
denied
and
then
they
were
claiming
that
was
error.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
well,
i
guess
it
just
seems
to
me
that
the
defendant
would
be
better
positioned
to
argue
that...
that
it
was
error
and...
and
reversal
of
his
conviction
is
justified
had
he
requested
it
and
had
it
been
denied.
and
maybe
i'm
wrong
in
that
regard,
but
it
just
seems
to
me
that
that
would
be
a
better
position
for
the
defendant
to
be
in
than
to
not
have
requested
it,
not
have
it
denied
and
have
the
matter
go
up
on
appeal
and
raise
it
for
the
first
time
in
an
appellate
court,
and...
and
say
that...
that
it
was
a
problem.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
2901.22
of
the
ohio
revised
code,
and
it's
discussed
in
the
ohio
supreme
court
opinion
in
this
regard,
says
that
when
a
statute
is
silent
with
respect
to
intent
or
scienter
that
unless
the...
the
criminal
proscription
plainly
indicates
that
strict
liability
is
to
be
imposed,
that
you
pick
up
another
statute
with
a
minimum
culpable
mental
state
of
recklessness,
which...
which,
at
least
in
this
regard,
is...
is
the
perverse...
the
disregard
of
a
known
risk.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
that
would
be
my
view,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
there
have
been
two
ohio
supreme
court
opinions,
one
in
1980
and
one
in
1984,
which
i
cite
at
page
37
of
the
brief,
that...
that
have...
have
done
that,
with
respect
to
the
child-endangering
statute,
and
with
respect
to
certain
prostitution
offenses,
where
there
is
no
mental
state
in
the
statute
itself,
but
they
pick
up
the
recklessness
statute.
and
we
argue
that
both
the
statute,
which
is
15
years
old,
and
those
existing
ohio
supreme
court
decisions
did
give
an
indication
that
that
was,
you
know,
an
element
of
scienter.
with
respect
to...
to
stanley,
and
that
is
an
issue
that
not
only
ohio,
but
the
other
18
states
that
have
possession
offenses
on...
on
the
books
in
the
various
states
have
great
concern,
and
that
is
whether
stanley
would
preclude
the
application
of
a
possession
offense
when
we're
dealing
with
the
defendant's
own
home.
it's
our
position
that
the
court
found
in...
in
ferber
that
there
are
a
number
of
interests
the
state
has
in
controlling
and
regulating
child
pornography,
mainly
because
of
the
harm
caused
to
children
through
its
production,
distribution
and
use.
that
harm
being
physical,
psychological,
emotional
mental,
physiological,
and
that
that
interest
in
proscribing
possession
of
the
material
is
the
same
as
it
is
in
a
production
and
distribution.
the
permanent
record
of
harm
which
the
court
was
concerned
with
in
ferber
is
ongoing
and
continues,
while
the
possession
occurs
in
the
privacy
of
the
home.
and
i
must
note
that...
that
it,
either
in
the
district
of
columbia
here
or
in...
anywhere
across
the
country,
you
cannot
walk
into
a
stand,
or
what
might
be
called
adult
bookstore,
and
purchase
child
pornography,
simply
because
the...
the
distribution
statutes
and
this
court's
decision
in
ferber,
it
has
been
driven
underground.
the
only
method...
or
an
additional
method
that
the
state
needs
in
that
underground
child
pornography
market
is
that
possession
offense
if
we're
going
to
dry
up
the
market.
that
is
an
interest
i
believe
the
state
has,
in
addition
to
the
interest
of
avoiding
that
continuing
haunting
fear
on
the
child
who's
been
used
in
this
kind...
in
producing
this
kind
of
material.
the
court
was
concerned
with...
and
noted
in
ferber
itself
that
that
permanent
record
was
evidence
of
ongoing
harm
due
to
the
psychological
and
emotional
distress
to
the
youngster.
just
by
knowing
the
fact
that
it's
out
there,
many
times
it's
used
to
blackmail
the
youngsters,
the
fear
of
subsequent
public
exposure
or
use
in
commercial
distributions
all
cause
that
child,
in
trying
to
recover
from
the
original
abuse,
the
child's
sexual
abuse,
trying
to
recover,
that
is
what
the
experts
say
a
severe
problem
in
addressing
it.
and
i
think
the
possession
statute,
in...
by
just
merely
saying
it
is
illegal
to
possess
it,
goes
a
very
long
way
in...
in
fighting
the
problem,
which
has
been...
has
gone
underground,
in
trying
to
dry
up
that
market,
which
i
think
the
state
has
a
very
strong
interest
in
doing.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
it's
an
effective
way,
justice
stevens,
but
i...
i
believe
that
the
states
need
that
additional
tool
of
a
possessory
offense.
if
they
are...
they
are
denied
that
possessory
offense
and
are
told
you
must
only
prosecute
people
in
this
industry
or
pedophiles
who
are
interested
in
collecting
or
keeping
this
material,
if
you
are
only
permitted
to
prosecute
those
who
produce
or
sell
it
or
otherwise
distribute
it,
i
think
we're
going
to
have
a
serious
problem
in
trying
to...
to
continue
to
address
it,
simply
because
the
production
is
always
surreptitious.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
and
many
of
the
arrests
are
on
possession
offenses.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
and
because
you
are
able
to
arrest
those
people
on
possession
offenses,
you
are
able
to
even
move
up
the
ladder
to
those
involved
in
the
sale
and
distribution.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
no,
it's
not
meaningless,
your
honor.
in
fact,
we
still
have
two
good
statutes
that
we
will
use
when
we
can
prove
production
and
distribution.
what
i'm
saying
is,
is
because
it's
underground
and
you
can't
walk
into
paul
ferber's
bookstore
in
manhattan
and
buy
child
pornography
today,
that
because
it's
underground
that
the
additional
tool
of
having
a
possession
offense
is
necessary
to
address
the
problem.
and
that
the
state
does
have
an
interest
in
going
to
that
possessory
offense
and
applying
it
to...
to
the
home
or
anywhere
else
that
it
might
be
possessed.
so
i
guess
what
the
state's
interest,
besides
that
is,
is
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
briefing
materials,
not
only
the
permanent
record
of
harm
that
exists,
but
we
can
attempt
to
dry
up
the
problem
with
that
additional
tool.
and
finally,
the
materials
used
to...
to
continue
that
cycle
of
child
sexual
abuse
that...
that
the
court
addressed
in
ferber,
by
means
of
seducing
other
children
to
engage
in
activity,
and
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
an
extensive
background
regarding
how
the
material
is
used
to
further
additional
sexual
abuse,
to
condition
children
to
the
use.
i
guess,
in
comparing
those
interests
with
the
defendant's
interest,
i
think
that's
what
the
court
needs...
needs
to
do,
and
the
defendant's
interests
to
receive
information
or
ideas,
it
seems
to
me
are
de
minimis
compared
to
what
the
state's
interests
are.
and
i
fail
also
to
see
what
idea
or
information
is
conveyed
by
the
four
photographs
in
question
here.
it
seems
to
me
we're
not
discussing
the
merits
of...
of
sexual
conduct
with
children
or
debating
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
the
idea
communicated
or
the
items
in
the
library
that's
supposedly
infringed
is...
is
very
minimal
compared
to
the
state's
interest
in...
justice
stevens,
do
you
have
a
question?
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
it
would
be
recklessness
under
the--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--well,
there
is...
there
is
a
specific
definition.
there
are
four
culpable
mental
states
in
ohio,
purposely,
knowingly,
recklessly,
and
negligently.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
he
has
to
perversely
disregard
a
known
risk
is
the
statutory
language.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
well,
it
seems
to
me,
he
has
to
know
it's
a
picture
of
a
minor,
he
has
to
know
that
it
is
a
minor
which
is
nude,
and
not
only
nude
but
involving
a
lewd
exhibition
or
graphic
focus
on
the
genitals.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
i'm
not
sure
he
contends
he
didn't
know
those
things;
i
think
he's
contending
that
the
statute,
at
the
time,
before
its
construction,
would
not
lead
him
to
believe
that.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
i...
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
and,
in
conclusion,
the...
the
state
of
ohio
would--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--i
would
say
not,
because
there's
no
way
the
state
could
prove
that
he...
that
he
knew
the
material
that
he
possessed
depicted
the
visual
depiction
of
a
minor
and
that
the
depiction
was
a--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--one
marijuana
cigarette
would
be
what
is
known
in
ohio
as
a
minor
misdemeanor,
and
particularly
with
respect
to
marijuana
if
the
amount
is
less
than
i
believe
100
grams,
which
is
approximately
three
ounces.
it's
not
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
there
are
statutes
like
that,
but
in
addition
to
that,
justice
marshall,
there
are
also
simple
possession
statutes.
possession
has
to
be
a
knowing
thing.
if
someone
walked
up
and
put
something
in
my
pocket
and
i
didn't
know
it
was
there,
and
i
got
stopped,
you
know,
i
didn't
knowingly
possess
it,
even
though
it
was
on
my
person.
and
it
seems
to
me,
however,
that
is
different
from,
you
know,
knowingly
possessing
an
item,
whether
it's
a
marijuana
cigarette
or
photos.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
the
record
in
this
regard,
justice
marshall,
indicates
that
the
defendant
obtained
them
from
a
man...
in
columbus
he
obtained
them...
from
a
man
in
florida
who
was
charged
with
federal
postal
mailing
of
child
pornography.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
well,
there's
no
evidence
that
the
photographs
were
taken
in
florida.
the
photographs
were
delivered
to
clyde
osborne
by
jack
smith
in
columbus,
ohio.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
the
record
says
the
pictures
could
have
been
taken
anywhere.
however,
justice
marshall,
i
believe
the
state
of
ohio
has
an
interest--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--the
pictures,
according
to
the
records,
could
have
been
taken
anywhere.
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
well,
i...
i
think
that
protecting
the
children
in
the
state
of
ohio--
mr.
ronald
j.
o'brien
--i
don't
think
i
would,
your
honor.
i
see
the
red
light
is
on,
so
i
will
conclude
my
remarks.
thank
you.
