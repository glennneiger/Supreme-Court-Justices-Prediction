the
fact...
let
me
just
ask...
the
fact
that
it's
gone
underground,
i
don't
see
why
that
makes
efforts
to
prohibit
the
sale
or
the
commercial
distribution
unlawful,
though.
i
mean,
that's
still
an
effective
way
of
attacking
this
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
well,
but
that's
true
of
a
lot
of
criminal
activity.
producing
narcotic
drugs,
for
example,
is
surreptitious
and
the
sale
is
surreptitious,
but
they
make
lots
of
arrests
of
people
who
do
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
but...
but
you
seem
to
talk
about
the
fact
that
it's
underground
means
that...
that
the
prohibition
against
sale
and
production
is
meaningless,
but
i
just
don't
quite
follow.
justice
stevens
another
question
i
had.
we
talked
about
a
scienter
requirement
in
this,
what
is
it
in
the
way
of
scienter
that
has
to
be
proved
under
the--
justice
stevens
--reckless...
what
sort
of
recklessness?
i
mean,
in
what
regard
was--
justice
stevens
--well,
purposely...
say
it's
purposely
knowing.
what
does
the...
what
does
the
defendant
have
to
purposely
know?
justice
stevens
well,
but...
but,
risk
of
what?
i
mean,
he
knows
it's
a
picture
of
a
child.
is
that
all
that's
required?
justice
stevens
and
the
defendant
contends
he
didn't
know
any
of
these
things,
is
that
what
it
amounts
to?
