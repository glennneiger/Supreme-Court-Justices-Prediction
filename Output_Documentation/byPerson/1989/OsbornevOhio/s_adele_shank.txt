ms.
s.
adele
shank
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
court:
the
issues
in
the
present
case
are
three.
first,
can
an
unconstitutionally,
overbroad
statute
be
construed
on
appeal
and
then
retroactively
applied
to
affirm
the
appellant's
conviction?
second,
may
this
state,
consistent
with
first
amendment
rights,
prohibit
the
private,
in-home
possession
of
depictions
of
child
nudity,
where
the
nudity
consists
of
either
a
lewd
exhibition
or
involves
a
graphic
focus
on
the
genitals?
and
third,
has
the
ohio
supreme
court
successfully
limited
ohio's
child
nudity
statute
to
bring
it
within
constitutional
limitations?
clyde
osborne
was
charged
under
an
ohio
statute
prohibiting
the
possession
of
pictures
of
nude
children.
this
statute
was
unconstitutionally
overbroad
on
its
face
and
as
applied
to
mr.
osborne.
the
statute
prohibited
simple
possession
and
mere
viewing.
it
failed
to
include
an
element
of
scienter,
as
required
by
this
court's
decisions
in
smith
v.
california
and
new
york
v.
ferber.
it
failed
to
specify
the
age
below
which
children
could
not
be
depicted,
also
as
required
by
new
york
v.
ferber,
and
it
prohibited
depictions
of
mere
nudity,
contrary
to
this
court's
decisions
in
erznoznik
v.
jacksonville
and
ferber.
mr.
osborne
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
prior
to
trial.
the
court
denied
his
motion,
and
the
trial
proceeded
under
the
statute
as
written.
only
at
the
close
of
evidence
did
the
trial
court
rule
that
the
statute
applied
to
depictions
of
those
under
the
age
of
18.
mr.
osborne
was
convicted.
on
appeal,
the
tenth
district
court
of
appeals
affirmed
18
as
the
age
of
minority,
and
construed
nudity
to
mean
a
lewd
exhibition
of
the
genitals.
the
ohio
supreme
court
redefined
nudity
on
review
to
drop
the
requirement
that
genitalia
by
depicted;
nudity
now
means,
under
that
court's
interpretation,
either
a
lewd
exhibition
or,
in
the
alternative,
a
depiction
involving
a
graphic
focus
on
the
genitals.
the
court
added
an
element
of
scienter,
recklessness,
and
again
affirmed
that
18
is
the
upper
limit
of
the
age
of
minority.
mr.
osborne's
conviction
was
affirmed
under
this
new
construction
and
he
moved
for
rehearing
on
the
ground
that
this
retroactive
conviction
violated
his
right
to
due
process.
his
motion
was
denied.
clyde
osborne
stands
today
convicted
under
a
statute
wholly
different
from
the
one
under
which
he
was
charged
and
tried.
and
this
is
the
basis
of
our
first
issue.
the
statute
in
this
case,
as
i
previously
noted,
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
due
to
its
unconstitutionality
was
invalid.
a
conviction
obtained
under
such
a
statute
is
a
nullity,
and
the
conviction
cannot
be
brought
to
life
by
a
subsequent
constitutionalizing
construction
of
the
statute.
this
principle
is
well
established
in
precedent
from
this
court.
in
lovell
v.
griffin,
thornhill
v.
alabama,
and
shuttlesworth
v.
birmingham,
this
court
has
held
that
an
unconstitutional
statute
is
in
fact
invalid
on
its
face,
that
no
one
is
required
to
comply
with
such
a
statute,
and
that
a
subsequent
construction
will
not
succeed
in
criminalizing
preconstruction
conduct.
this
is,
in
fact,
the
essence
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
there
was
hearsay
testimony
that
the
child
was
either
13
or
14.
however,
no
finding
of
fact
on
that
issue
was
made,
and
the
jury
was
instructed
only
to
find
that
the
child
was
under
the
age
of
18,
your
honor.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
your
honor,
mr.
osborne
did
testify
that
he
had
been
told
that
the
age
of
the
child
was
14,
however,
he
had
no
actual
or
personal
knowledge,
and
this
was
brought
out
in
the
course
of
the
presentation
of
evidence
at
trial.
as
i
was
saying,
the
essence
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine
is
that
when
a
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face
and
one
challenges
the
unconstitutionality
of
that
statute,
when
the
challenge
has
been...
successful,
the
appellant
cannot
then
be
convicted
under
new
and
constitutionalizing
construction
of
the
statute.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
well,
your
honor--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--in
shuttlesworth
v.
birmingham,
the
court
had
in
effect
already
given
a
narrowing
construction...
this
is
the
second
shuttlesworth
v.
birmingham,
because
there
are
two
of
the
same
name...
had
already
been
construed
by
the
court
by
the
time...
by
the
lower
state
court
by
the
time
it
reached
this
court,
and
the
court
accepted,
for
purposes
of
that
case,
that
the
new
construction
was
constitutional,
but
still
held
that
conviction
under
the
old
unconstitutional
statute
was
not
allowable.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
yes,
your
honor.
the
statute
was
invalid
on
its
face.
the
court
didn't--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--no,
because,
in
the
interim,
it
has
been
subjected
to
a
new
constitutionalizing
construction,
which
the
court--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--well,
i
think
one
of
the
clear
points
that
demonstrates
that
it
was
a
nullity--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
ms.
s.
adele
shank
that's
true.
however,
the
court
did
say
in
shuttlesworth
that
under
the
statute,
as
it
was
written
in
its
unconstitutional
form,
even
though
shuttlesworth
had
applied
for
a
permit,
that
he
had
been
under
no
obligation
to
do
so
because
of
the
statute's
invalidity.
and
it
would
completely
unfair
to
say
that
a
person
had
no
obligation
to
comply
with
the
statute
because
it
was
invalid,
and
then
to
subject
them
to
a
conviction,
simply
because
it
had
later
on
been
construed.
and
so
i
think
the
fact
that
that...
there
was
no
requirement
to
comply
with
the
invalid
statute
is
a
clear
indication
that
it
was
in
fact
a
nullity,
because
the
court
wouldn't
say
you
didn't
have
to
comply
with
a
valid
statute.
in
addition
to...
excuse
me,
your
honors...
in
addition--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--well,
i
think
that
the
court
can
do
just
what
you
said
and
say
we
cannot
prosecute
this
particular
defendant
because
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
i
don't
think
that
that
would
necessarily
be
true,
because
oftentimes
the
courts--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--that...
this
is
how--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--well,
but,
your
honor,
it's
no
different
than
when
the
court
makes
that
same
determination
at
the
appellate
level.
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
decision
is
mere
dictum,
it
stills
says
that
the
defendant
is
excused
from
liability
and
the
court's
holding
is
still
the
next
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
binds
everybody
else
who
is
prosecuted.
in
addition,
if
i
understood
your
question,
i
think
there
is
a
different
kind
of
situation
where
the
court
can
narrow.
and
that
is
the
one
that
is
frequently
cited
in
dombrowski,
the
famous
footnote,
dombrowski
number
7.
and
that
is
where
the
essential
problem
with
the
statute
is
not
its
overbreadth,
but
the
overriding
problem
with
the
statute
is
its
vagueness.
and
in
those
circumstances,
that's
the
kind
of
case
where
this
court
has
held
many
times
that
that
person
who
falls
within
the
hard
core
of
what
the
statute
addresses
doesn't
have...
can't
succeed
under
a
narrowing
type
of
construction,
but--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--well,
your
honor,
our
third
issue
is
that
we
do
think
that
it's
still
prescribes
protected
materials
and
that
it
is...
fails
to
serve
a
compelling
state
interest.
but
were
it,
now,
successfully
made
constitutional,
yes,
it
would
be
applicable
to
those
in
the
future.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
your
honor,
and
i
thought
about
that
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
it
would
be
better
to
try
to
address
the
question
of
void/voidable,
but
this
court's
own
language
has
always
been
either
that
it
was
invalid
or
that
the
statute
itself
was
void.
and
i
think
that
that
makes
the
most
sense,
in
terms
of
accepting
the
federal
constitution
as
the
basis
upon
which
all
laws
must
be
built.
if
it
violates
that
foundation
of
the
constitution,
it
should
not
have
any
validity.
and
so
from
that
perspective,
i
think
that...
that
void
is
an
appropriate
term.
and
i
wanted
to
point
out,
your
honors,
that
the
policy
behind
allowing
this
is
truly
the
core
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine,
which
allows
one,
whose
own...
whose
own
conduct
may
not
be
protected,
to
challenge
a
statute.
because
if
one,
whose
own
conduct
wasn't
protected,
could
not
challenge
a
statute
for
its
overbreadth
and
succeed,
if
in
fact
all
that
he
could
achieve
would
be
a
narrowing
construction
and
then
a
subsequent
conviction,
there
would
be
no
point
to
him
ever
raising
the
challenge.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
what's
being
prohibited--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--that's
true,
but
it's
just
like
a
book
that
you
buy
for
yourself
or
a
diary
that
you
write
for
yourself,
it's...
it's
a
communication
that
you
hold.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
well,
certainly.
and
when
one
holds
a
book
and
then
subsequently
reads
it,
it's
still
a
communication.
and
when
one
holds
a
picture
and
subsequently
views
it,
it's
still
a
communication.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
anything
that
one
uses...
and
now
we're
moving
towards
the
issue
of
the
privacy
interest
in
your
own
home--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--anything
that
one
uses
in
one's
own
home,
whether
you
want
to
characterize
it
as
eliciting
feelings
or
as
being
communicative
or
generating
new
thought
processes,
it's
all
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
as
this
court
said
in
stanley
v.
georgia,
the
state
has
no
interest
in
controlling
the
thoughts
of
any
person
or
controlling
what
one
person
has...
or
in
even
viewing
into
the
contents
of
one's
library.
and
i
think
under
that
analysis,
it
definitely
is
a
first
amendment,
protected-type
of
communication.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
well,
one
of
the
things
about
this
case
is
i
don't
believe
that
the
state
has
demonstrated
any
kind
of
compelling
interest
in
regulating
the
materials
addressed
in
this
statute,
at
least
with
regard
to
those
that
depict
children
under
the
age
of
18
and
over
the
age
of
15.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
well,
even
if
the
court
wanted
to
say
it
was
merely
substantial,
but
we
are
talking
about
fundamental
constitutionally
guaranteed
rights--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--no,
it's
not
a
right
to
child
pornography.
it's
a
right
to
have...
to
receive
communications,
it's
the
right
to
privacy
in
the
home--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--it
would
be...
that...
that
would
be
included
within
that
broad
right,
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
be.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
well,
the
state
does
claim
to
be
protecting
its
right
to
stop
sexual
abuse
of
children,
which
it
says
is
necessarily
involved
in
production
of
these
types
of
pictures.
however,
the
state
of
ohio,
at
least
with
regard
to
those
over
the
age
of
15,
permits
sexual
conduct.
it's
legal
for
any
adult
to
have
sex
with
a
child
over
the
age
of
15
in
the
state.
fifteen
is
the
age
of
consent,
and
under
ohio
revised
code
2907.04,
corruption
of
a
minor,
adults
may
have
sexual
conduct...
that
is,
any
kind
of
sexual
activity
with
one
15
years
of
age
or
older.
and
i
think
before
the
state
can
claim
that
it
has
an
interest
in
stopping
sexual
abuse
of
children
by
invading
people's
homes
and
privacy
and
controlling
the
regulating...
regulating
this
type
of
depiction,
it
first
must
try
to
stop
what
it
alleges
to
have
a
compelling
state
interest
in
stopping,
that
is,
sexual
abuse,
by
making
that
actual
conduct
illegal.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
yes.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
well,
it
is
a
different
interest,
and
the
states
recognize
that
different
interest
in
other
statutes.
there
is
a
statute
that
says
that
you
cannot
have
sexual
contact,
which
is
any
kind
of
sexual
touching
short
of
intercourse
with
one
who
is
between
the
ages
of
13
and
15
unless
there
is
a
four
year
or
less
difference
in
the
age
of
the
older
partner
and
the
child
contacted.
so
when
ohio
has
chosen
to
make
that
kind
of
age
differentiation,
that
you
just
mentioned,
be
critical,
they
have
put
it
into
the
statute.
that's
not
what
happened
with
the
age
of
consent.
the
age
of
consent
statute
makes
no
limitation.
any
adult
may
engage
freely
in
sexual
conduct,
which
is
all
types
of
sexual
activity,
with
anyone
over
the
age
of
15.
if
the
state
of
ohio,
if
the
general
assembly
believed
that
sexual
conduct
constituted
sexual
abuse,
they
would
have
made
it
illegal
to
engage
in
that
activity.
trying
to
then
assert
a
state
interest
in
stopping
that
activity
to
justify
the
regulation
of
private,
in-home
possession
of
such
depictions
makes
no
sense,
when
the
state
has
yet
to
try
to
stop
the
activity
by
overtly
prohibiting
it.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
i
see
what
you're
saying,
justice
scalia,
and
i
do
think
that
there's
a
difference
between
a
commercialized
drawing
in
of
a
child
into
a
life
of
pornography
and
the
things
that
are
dealt
with
in
this
statute.
this
statute
does
not
address
commercial
production,
distribution.
this
statute
is
completely
limitless
in
terms
of
the
types
of
materials
that
can
be
used.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
well,
the
state
certainly
has
an
obligation,
before
it
starts
trying
to
allege
that
it's
working
towards
that
goal,
to
make
the
activity
involved
in
such
depictions
illegal,
and
it
has
not.
and
it
goes
much
further,
it
allows
all
kinds
of
sexual
conduct.
and
in
addition,
if
the
state
truly
is
interested
in
stopping
that
kind
of
activity,
it
would
not
have
created
the
exceptions
that
exist
in
this
statute.
parents
are
now
permitted
to
possess
depictions
of
children
that
are
lewd
exhibitions
or
involve
a
graphic
focus
on
the
genitals
under
the
state
supreme
court's
decision.
parents
are
now,
under
this
interpretation
of
the
statute,
permitted
to
give
consent
for
the
use
of
their
children
for
the
production
of
this
type
of
material
or
to
give
their
consent
to
others
possessing
it.
and
the
state
of...
and
the
statute,
as
construed,
allows
people
to
keep
pictures
like
this
for
artistic
purposes.
if,
in
fact,
these
pictures
are
of
sexual
abuse
of
children,
there
is
no
interest
that
legitimizes
letting
those
exceptions
exist.
as
this
court
said
in
florida
star
v.
b.j.f.,
when
the
state
creates
a
statute
that
is
underinclusive
and
leaves
a
broad
area
of
the
activity
it
supposedly
has
an
interest
in
stopping,
unprohibited,
the
state
has
demonstrated
its
lack
of
a
compelling
interest
in
dealing
with
that
subject
matter.
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
the
state
of
ohio
has
failed
to
demonstrate
that
it
has
a
compelling
interest
either
in
prohibiting
the
private,
in-home
possession
of
these
materials
or
in
prohibiting,
in
the
broader
question
of
the
overbreadth
of
the
statute,
in
bringing
it
into
a
narrowly-tailored
stance
that
serves
a
compelling
state
interest.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
i
read
stanley
v.
georgia--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--that's
true,
but
i
believe
that
when
you
go
to
the
point
of
prohibiting
the
private,
in-home
possession,
as
noted
in
stanley
v.
georgia,
and
there,
are
again
attacking
or
invading
the
fundamental
rights
to
privacy
to
receive
information
and
to
think
thoughts,
you
have
again
moved
into
the
area
of
fundamental
rights
and
a
compelling
interest
is
in
fact
required.
now,
again,
and
the
third
issue
in
our
case
is
that
we
do
not
believe
that
these
pictures
fall
within
a
category
of
unprotected
speech.
in
new
york
v.
ferber,
this
court
said
that
in
order
to
constitute
child
pornography,
the
depictions
must
include
characterization...
pictures
of
sexual
conduct.
that's
not
required
in
this
statute.
and
depictions
of
sexual
conduct
or
sexual
activity
of
any
kind
are
regulated
by
two
other
statutes,
the
two
that
immediately
precede
this
one,
ohio
revised
code
2907.321
and
322.
in
fact,
these
still
regulate
depictions
of
mere
nudity.
now,
this
court
in
ferber
did
say
that
graphic
or...
lewd
exhibitions
of
the
genitals,
so
long
as
that
phrase
was
not
construed
too
broadly,
would
qualify
as
sexual
conduct.
but
in
this
case,
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
limited
the
requirement
that
genitalia
be
depicted,
and
this
construction
is
the
only
statute
in
the
many
that
deal
with
this
type
of
material
that
doesn't
at
least
require
that
genitalia
be
depicted,
and
for
that
reason,
brought
it
into
the
definition
of
nudity,
which
is
included
in
2907.01(h).
that
includes
depictions
of
breasts,
buttocks,
the
pubic
area,
as
well
as
genitals.
so
even
under
the
state
supreme
court's
statute
and
even
under
the
broadest
characterization
of
the
kind
of
materials
this
court
felt
could
be
characterized
as
unprotected
in
new
york
v.
ferber,
this
statute
falls.
and
as
i
previously
pointed,
out,
this
statute
does
not
address
depictions
that
are
commercial
in
nature.
it
also
includes
mere
possession
and
viewing...
simple
viewing
of
these
photographs.
and
ferber
dealt
with
the
production
and
distribution
of
this
type
of
material.
for
that
reason,
we
do
not
believe
that
it
falls
within
the
ferber
definition,
and
as
i
previously
pointed
out,
i
do
not
think
that
it
fits
the
state...
that
the
state
has
demonstrated
a
compelling
state
interest
in
prohibiting
the
possession
of
these
materials.
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
i
think
one
of
the
remarks
that
was
made
close
to
the
end
of
mr.
o'brien's
comments
is
telling
about
the
effects
of
this
statute.
he
noted
that
when
the
state
finds
that
it
is
able
to,
it
will
use
its
other
two
statutes
on
production
and
distribution
to
go
after
people
who
have
this
type
of
depiction.
those
two
statutes
already
prohibit
possession
of
those
kinds
of
depictions
that
constitute
obscenity
in
ohio
and
that
depict
sexual
activity
as
it's
defined
under
the
ohio
law.
mr.
o'brien's
acknowledgement
that
those
statute
will
be
used...
used
to
go
after
these
people
is
a
clear
indication
that
the
construction
of
this
statute
has
moved
it
from
what
it
originally
was
intended
to
be
by
the
ohio
legislature,
which
was
a
prohibition
against
depictions
of
mere
nudity,
and
changed
it
into
a
child
pornography
statute,
which
is
what
those
other
two
statutes,
ohio
revised
code
2907.321
and
322
are.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
well,
your
honor,
i
know
that
they
do
claim
that
it
is
not
overbroad.
i
am
not
sure
they
go
quite
as
far
as
saying
that
they
had
absolutely...
that
it
was
clear
that
that's
what
it
meant.
in
fact,
on
page
42
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
beginning
of
the
first
full
paragraph,
the
court
acknowledges
that
it
is
true
that
the
statute
does
not
expressly
limit
the
prohibited
state
of
nudity
to
allude
exhibition
or
graphic
focus
on
the
genitals.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
i
agree
that
they
do
say
that,
but
they
say
it
in
a
very--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--it's
a...
your
honor,
i
have
to...
i
simply
point
out
to
the
court
that
their
language
is
kind
of
back
and
forth,
and
that
at
the
conclusion
of
that
little
discussion,
they
do
then
say,
and
that's...
this
is
in
the
center
of
the
final
full
paragraph,
again,
on
page
42
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
as...
authoritatively
construed
that
day
by
the
court.
so,
i
think
that
although
the
court
does
waffle
on
the
point,
i
think
it's
very
clear
from
its
own
opinion
that
it
acknowledges
that
that
wasn't
the
case
and
that
it's
construction
that
day
is
what
brings
the
statute
into
what
it
hopes
to
be
constitutional
lines.
another
point
that
was
raised
by
mr.
o'brien
is
the
fact
that
he
alleges
that
18
other
states
have
statutes
that
are
very
much
like
ours.
in
fact,
that's
not
true.
none
of
the
18
state
statutes
cited
by
mr.
o'brien
or
in
the
amicus
brief
from
the
ohio
attorney
general
include
viewing
as
a
potential
for
conviction.
every
other
statute
requires
that
there
be
a
depiction
of
the
genitals.
a
number
of
those
statutes,
although
they
prohibit
possession...
prohibit
possession
for
specific
purposes,
some
of
them
for
distribution.
essentially,
there
is
not
a
single
statute
that
replicates
the
ohio
statute.
ours
is
the
broadest
statute
in
the
country.
mr.
o'brien
suggested
that
a
retrial
would
be
appropriate
in
this
case,
and
it
would
not.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
that's
after
the
construction.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
yes,
because
even
after
the
construction,
ohio
still
includes
mere
viewing,
and
ohio
includes
possession
without
any
restriction
for
why
it's
possessed,
and
ohio
does
not
require
that
genitals
be
depicted.
with
regard
to
whether
or
not
this
should
go
back
for
retrial,
the
answer
is
no.
even
though
the
statute
was
construed,
and
even
though
the
state
contends
that
there
might
have
been
sufficient
evidence,
which
we
do
not
acknowledge
at
this
point,
to
get
a
conviction,
had
it
been
dealt
with
properly,
you
can
never
make
up
for
the
fact
that
the
defendant
didn't
have
notice
at
the
time
he
acted
of
what
conduct
was
prohibited.
when
a
statute
uses--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--well,
in
fact,
i
believe
that
what
you're
saying
is
the
essence
of
the
concept
of
overbreadth
again.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
exactly,
which
is
part
of
what
the
problem--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--well,
and
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
but...
and
paul
[inaudible]
has
addressed
this
exact
issue.
when
the
language
of
the
statute
literally
includes
within
its
meaning,
conduct
that
is
clearly,
constitutionally
protected,
it,
in
effect,
gives
no
notice
that
any
conduct
is
prohibited.
and
for
that
reason,
there
is
no
notice
when
you
have
a
statute
that's
overbroad
on
its
face.
and
this
was
noted
by
this
court
in
the
shuttlesworth
decision.
it
was
also
noted
in
another
case
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
ashton
v.
kentucky.
in
both
of
those
cases
the
court
found
that
the
statutes
were
invalid
on
their
face
and
noted
that
the
language
used
in
the
statutes
fell
within
parameters
that
this
court
had
held
in
other
cases
was...
were
unconstitutional.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
i
don't
believe
it
does,
because
the
same
principles
were
followed,
as
i
just
noted,
in
ashton,
which
was
not.
that
was
simply
a
criminal
libel
statute.
and
the
same
principles
were
followed
in
thornhill
v.
alabama.
that
was
a
loitering
statute
which
was...
prohibited
picketing
in
the
site
of
a
labor
dispute...
anywhere
near
the
site
of
a
labor
dispute.
so
this
type
of
decision
has
not
been
limited
to
situations
where
there
was
a
licensing
or
permit
requirement.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
you
can't
make
up
for
the
fact
that
there
was
no
notice,
another
aspect
that
i
think
negates
against
a
retrial
in
this
case
is
the
fact
that
mr.
osborne
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
have
a
fair
trial
or...
and...
and
goes
against...
i
notice
my
time
is
up.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
thank
you,
your
honor.
