a
state
court
where...
where
an
overbreadth
objection
to
a
conviction
is
urged
and
the...
the
state
supreme
court
says,
well,
that
isn't
what
the
statute
means
at
all;
it's
not
overbroad
at
all
because
here
is
what
that
statute
means.
we're
not
a
legislature
and
we
can't
change
the
terms
of
the
statute,
but
we
construe
what
the
legislature
meant.
is
that
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
did?
justice
white
they
just
construed
it?
justice
white
this
is
what
it's
always
meant?
justice
white
and
if
you...
and
if
you
think
it
meant
something
else,
you're
wrong?
justice
white
do
you
think
the...
do
you
think
the
ohio
supreme
court's
opinion
really
means
that
they
said
that,
to
the
extent
this
statute
reaches
mere
nudity
and
other
things,
it
is
unconstitutional
and...
but
we'll
just
declare
it
unconstitutional
to
that
extent?
is
that
what
they
did,
or
did
they
just
say
the
statute
has
always
meant
this?
justice
white
so
that's
different
than
a
legislative
revision
of
the
statute
pending
appeal?
justice
white
xxx
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
they...
they
say
this
is
what
the
statute
always
meant.
they
construe
the
statute
and
say
this
is
what
it's...
this
is
what
it's...
what
it's
always
meant.
they
don't...
they...
they
deny
that
it's
ever
been
overbroad.
justice
white
not
expressly,
but
then
they
say
if
you
take
into
consideration
the
other
aspects
of
the
statute,
it
doesn't
cover
just
nudity.
justice
white
well,
that's
the
construction.
justice
byron
