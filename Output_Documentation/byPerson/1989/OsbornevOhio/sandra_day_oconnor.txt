justice
o'connor
but
didn't
the
majority
of
the...
the
members
of
the
court
in
oakes
want
to
look
at
the
statute
as
it
was
originally
written
and...
and
wouldn't
accept
a
subsequent
mooting
of
the
case?
justice
o'connor
well,
but,
nonetheless,
the
focus
was
on
the
statute
as
originally
written?
justice
o'connor
and
what
if
that
is
done
here?
justice
o'connor
but
what
if
a
majority
of
this
court
thinks
that
it
is
overbroad
as
originally
written,
as
apparently
the
members
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
thought?
suppose
we
think
that's
right.
now,
where
does
that
leave
you?
