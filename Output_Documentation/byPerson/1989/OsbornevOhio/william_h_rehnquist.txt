rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
88-5986,
clyde
osborne
v.
ohio.
ms.
shank.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
shank,
in...
in
your
view,
could
the
state
of
ohio
constitutionally
apply
this
statute,
now
that
the
supreme
court
has
construed
it,
to
another
defendant?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so,
in
that
sense,
as
justice
kennedy
points
out,
there
may
be
some
problem
with
calling
it
a
nullity,
if
it
can
be
applied
to
people
in
the
future
after
the
living...
after
the
limiting
construction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
lot
of
water
has
flowed
under
the
bridge
since
stanley,
ms.
shank.
you
know
the
court
really
narrowed
stanley
[inaudible]
and
cases
like
that.
and...
and
here
the
state,
i
would
think,
has
considerable
interest
in
preventing
any
access
to
child
pornography
in
a
way
it
wouldn't
have
to
just
obscenity.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
does
the
state...
why
does
the
state
have
to
demonstrate
a
compelling
interest?
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
fundamental,
constitutionally
guaranteed
to
have
child
pornography?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but...
but
you're...
in
this
case,
this
man
was
convicted
of
having
pictures
of
nude,
minor
males
in
his
possession,
so
as
to
apply
it
to
him,
it's
a
right
to
receive
child
pornography,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's...
that's
the
interest
the
state
has
to
show
some...
you
say
a
compelling
interest,
but
perhaps
that
isn't
the
test;
that's
the
interest
the
state
is
protecting
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
shank.
mr.
o'brien,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the...
did
the
defendant
request
any...
any
charge
on
intent?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
ohio
have
any
doctrine
that
the
courts
will
imply
an
intent
requirement?
about
40
years
ago
this
court
decided
a
case
called
united
states
against
morrisett,
where
we
said
that
even
thought
the
statute
punishing
someone
criminally
did
not
say
that
there
was
an
intent
requirement,
one
would
be
implied
on
common
law
principles.
and
so
the
federal
courts
have
frequently
implied
the
existence
of
an
intent
requirement,
even
though
the
statute
didn't
say
so.
does
ohio
have
any
similar
doctrine,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
a
defendant
defending
a
prosecution
under
this
statute
would
have
presumably
been
justified
in
asking
for
an
instruction
on
recklessness
in
this
case,
on
the
basis
of
that
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
o'brien.
ms.
shank,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
if...
if
the
state
supreme
court
has
construed
it
more
narrowly,
surely
the
defendant
must
have
been
given
notice
by
the
language
of
the
statute
of
everything
he
possibly
could
have
been
subjected
to,
and
perhaps
more?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no,
it's
the
essence
of
the
contest...
concept
of
fair
notice.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
no.
no,
fair
notice
and
overbreadth
are
two
quite
different
things
i
had
thought.
one...
one
is
the
doctrine
of
vagueness,
and
the
other
is
that
the
statute
covers
too
much
ground.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
shank.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
