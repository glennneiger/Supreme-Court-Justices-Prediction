justice
kennedy
well,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
please,
but
those
cases
were
not
ones,
were
they,
in
which
this
court
or
any
other
court
held
they
were
susceptible
of
being
sustained
under
a
narrowing
construction?
justice
kennedy
or
am
i
incorrect
about
that?
justice
kennedy
but...
but
that
wasn't
because
the
statute
was
a
nullity,
was
it?
justice
kennedy
well,
did...
did...
the
court
hold
it
had
to
be
reenacted
by
the
legislature?
justice
kennedy
well,
then,
if
you
say...
then,
if
you
say
it
a
nullity,
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
term
that's
not...
the
definition
of
which
is
not
self-evident.
it
certainly
wasn't
a
nullity
in
the
sense
that
the
legislature
didn't
have
to
reenact
it.
justice
kennedy
i
am
right
about
that.
justice
kennedy
the
legislature
did
not
have
to
reenact
it;
it
was
still
on
the
books
with
the
narrowing
construction
after
the
state
narrowed
it.
justice
kennedy
do
you
read
our
cases
as
saying
a
compelling
state
interest
is
required
before
the
state
or
the
federal
government
may
enact
a
law
prohibiting
the
sale
of
obscenity?
justice
kennedy
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
that
obscenity
is
just
deemed
not
to
be
protected
speech.
justice
kennedy
is
that
inconsistent
with
shuttlesworth?
justice
kennedy
--you
didn't
show
lewd
exhibition.
the
jury
was
charged
in
those
terms.
justice
kennedy
but
the
jury
wasn't
charged
on
that.
justice
kennedy
suppose
the
defendant
here
had
asked
that...
that
the
jury
be
charged
with
reference
to
intent,
and
the
trial
judge
had
refused
the
instruction,
the
same
result,
a
valid
trial?
justice
kennedy
yes.
scienter.
justice
kennedy
well...
how
is
that
different
from
what
we
have
here?
justice
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
why...
why
do
you
say
there's
a
problem?
it's
just
denying
the
defendant
the
satisfaction
of
having
the
jury
consider
something,
which
you
now
say
it
doesn't
have
to
consider
anyway?
justice
kennedy
but
you...
you
acknowledge
that
there
is
a
real
problem
if
he
request
the
instruction
and
it's
not
given.
and
i
assume
that's
because
the
jury
verdict
is
somehow
inaccurate
as
a
reflection
of
what
the
statute
requires.
and
i
don't
see
how
that's
any
different
from
his
failing
to...
to
ask
for
something
which
the...
which
was
not
in
the
statute
until
the
court
later
construed
it.
justice
kennedy
does
it
make
a
difference
that
shuttlesworth
was
a
prior
restraint
case?
