mr.
roberts,
what
about
asking
a
passerby
to
sign
a
petition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roberts,
didn't
they
allow
solicitation
inside
the
post
office
at
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
wasn't
that
the
problem
of
deciding
whether
to
let
the
red
cross...
you
know,
you
had
your
content
discrimination
then.
isn't
that...
wasn't
that
part
of
the
problem
of
deciding
who
could
solicit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
one
might
argue
that
perhaps
it's
overbroad
for
that
reason,
that
it
responds
more
broadly
than
the
problem
that
it's
addressed
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
there
a
history
of
a
problem
outside
the
post
office?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
memory
is
that
lines
are
usually
a
little
more...
they
fill
up
the
lobby
pretty
often.
the
inside
is
often
fairly
crowded
in
these
post
offices,
a
busy
post
office.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roberts,
what
is
your
view,
supposing
this
regulation
did
prohibit
leafletting
and
picketing?
would
it
be
valid,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
give
the
same
reason
it
gives
here.
you
just
don't
want
a
lot
of
people
crowding
the
front
door.
that's
basically--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yeah,
but
how
do
you
know
it
won't
be
a
problem
tomorrow?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
could
stop.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
how
serious
does
the
problem
have
to
be?
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
we
have
3,500
post
offices.
maybe
three
or
four
of
them
get
very
crowded.
can
you
ban
picketing
all
over
the
country?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
even
in
justice
scalia's
example,
i
suppose
the
reason
is
we
own
the
property,
and
as
a
property
owner
we
have
control
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you,
you
can
you
could...
that
your
argument
applies
to
panhandling.
does
it
apply
to
all
commercial
solicitation,
selling
magazine
subscriptions
and
shoes
and
everything?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
is
commercial
speech
covered
by
your
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
panhandling
is
commercial
speech,
or
is
it
like
your
speech?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
one
other
question,
if
i
may.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
we
focus
on
access
to
the
building,
i
know...
i
realize
you're
making
a
facial
attack
on
the
regulation,
but
you
really
think
you
have
a
right
to
put
a
table
up
in
front
of
the
door?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
you
think
the
regulation
is
invalid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
don't
think
they
could
put
up
a
table
on
the
municipal
sidewalk,
do
you?
