justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
mr.
roberts,
will
you
tell
us'
exactly
what
this
regulation
covers?
i
take
it
the
post
office
regulation
does
permit
leafletting,
for
example.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
it
permit
handing
out
a
leaflet
that
said
we
hope
you'll
contribute
to
our
cause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
collection
on
the
spot.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it's
more
bothersome
than
the
leafletting?
i
mean,
is
that
demonstrable?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
these
problems
that
could
be
addressed
by
time,
place
and
manner
requirements,
by
making
the
location
of
such
a
booth
or
a
table
more
out
of
the
way
and
prohibiting
it
on
peak...
at
peak
hours
or
peak
days
or
something
of
that
sort?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
roberts,
i
would
assume
that
if
the
post
offices
are
permitting
petition
gathering,
signature
gathering,
that
some
of
those
could
be
conducted
in
a
very
aggressive
manner,
and
very
likely
the
post
office
is
willing
to
have
some
kind
of
restrictions
or
regulations
that
it's
willing
to
enforce
to
make
sure
that
patrons
aren't
subjected
to
abusive
tactics.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
have
no
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions
on
the
picketing
and
the
leafletting
and
the
petition
gathering?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
that
sort
of
restriction
not
be
applied
to
this
type
of
activity?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
roberts,
is
it
clear
that
public
forum
analysis
even
applies
here?
have
we
ever
applied
it
in
situations
where
the
public
clearly
has
access,
or
have
we
only
applied
that
where
what
is
sought
is
some
sort
of
access
to
the
facility?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
it's
a
satisfactory
sort
of
analysis?
is
it
working
out
satisfactorily
from
a
legal
standpoint,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
been
a
lot
of
criticism
of
it,
and
there
certainly
is...
are
suggestions
in
some
of
the
briefs
in
this
case
that
we
should
get
off
that
tack
and
onto
something
else
in
these
cases.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
they
could
give
the
postmaster
for
each
facility
some
authority
to
tailor
the
requirements
to
the
configuration
of
that
particular
premises.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
this...
if
you
apply
forum
analysis,
can
it
be
said
this
is
a
limited
public
forum?
you
keep
talking
about
nonpublic
forums.
certainly
some
public
access
and
usage
have
been
allowed,
as
we
explored
earlier
and
are
allowed.
so
perhaps
it's
a
limited
public
forum.
how
would
that
affect
the
analysis,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
think
in
effect
it's
been
opened
up
to
these
other
uses.
that's
the
proper
interpretation,
and
it's
a
limited
public
forum.
now
what's
the
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
still
just
reason?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
on
the
other
hand,
it
applies
equally
to
the
girl
scouts
and
the
salvation
army
and
your
client.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it...
it
is
directed
toward
the
asking
for
money
on
the
premises.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it's
hard
to
say
that's
content
based.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now
mr.
sekulow,
do
you...
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
government
could
not
simply
say
that
on
postal
premises
we
will
have
no
activity
of
any
kind
by
anybody
unless
it's
addressed
to
post
office
business?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
won't
be
leafletting;
there
won't
be
picketing;
there
won't
be
soliciting;
there
won't
be
anything.
you
can
come
and
go
for
postal
business,
and
that's
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
they
can
do
that,
why
can't
they
do
something
less
than
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
if...
if
once
you
accept
the
fact
that
the
post
office
could
exclude
every
use
other
than
the
postal
use,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
have
to
accept
the
fact
that
they
could
permit
some
lesser
restriction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
think
we
have
a
case
dealing
with
the
plaza
area?
wasn't
that
issue
decided--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
decided
against
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
precisely.
the
sidewalk,
the
public
sidewalk
was
open.
and
isn't
the
public
invited,
in
effect,
to
come
to
this
building
for
any
purpose
to
see
it,
to
stand
around,
whatever?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
aren't
they
welcome
to
come
and
do
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
and
do
you
think
that
we
have
to
then
permit
the
sort
of
activity
that
was
involved
here?
