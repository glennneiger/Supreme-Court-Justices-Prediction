rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-2031,
united
states
against
marsha
b.
kokinda.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roberts,
supposing
that
the
justice
department
wants
to
promulgate
a
regulation
saying
we
don't
want
anybody
coming
in
here
and
giving
speeches
in...
in
the
department
during...
in
the
halls
and
so--
now
you're
saying
there
has...
that...
that's
a
regulation
that
has
to
be
reasonable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
at
any
rate,
it
would
be
subject
to
review
in
any
court,
challenge
in
any
court,
and
if
you
satisfy
the
court
it
wasn't
reasonable,
then
the
court
would
say,
well,
go
ahead
and
give
speeches
in
the
justice
department?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
supports
that
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
a
kind
of
a
rational
basis
type
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
changes
the
doctrine
entirely.
if
it's
a
sufficient
reason
to
say
we
own
the
property,
then
you're
not
saying
any
regulation
has
to
be
reasonable
if
it's
on
a
property
that
you
own,
if
it's
enough
to
say
we
own
the
property.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
sekulow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
the
regulation
is
not
content
neutral?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
a
public
thoroughfare
only
from
the
parking
lot
to
the
post
office,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
access
to
the
post
office.
so
i
don't
see...
unless
you
mean
no
more
than
that,
i
don't
know
why
you
call
it
a
public
thoroughfare.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
so
long
as
the
government
allows
the
public
access
to
a
government
building,
it
has
to
show
a
compelling
reason
why
there
shouldn't
be
speech
in
the
building?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
post
office
is
open
to
the
general
public,
too.
why
should
there
be
a
different
rule
for
the
sidewalk
outside
than
the
post
office
inside?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you...
you
say
the
compelling
interest
standards
governs
inside
the
post
office,
but
it's
been
met
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
would
just
be
a
question
of
what
the...
what
the
walk
was
used
for,
then.
i
suppose
if
the
walk
became
terribly
congested
and
it
was
shown
people
couldn't
really
get
into
the
post
office
because
of
the
solicitation,
then
you
could
ban
it
outside.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why...
why
wouldn't
you
say
the
same
thing
about
the
inside
of
the
post
office,
then,
that
all
you
could
have
would
be
a
time,
place
and
manner
regulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
operation
of
the
post
office,
not
the
forum.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
post
office
not
allowed
to
make
that
sort
of
an
ad
hoc
decision
if
things
are
very
bad
inside
that
post
office,
they
might
not
be
quite
as
bad
outside
but
were
bad
enough
to
regulate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why...
why
do
you
need
to
meet
the
compelling
interest
test?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
are
you...
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
this
is
a
public
forum.
under
our
cases,
government
property,
adderley,
greer
against
spock,
the
government
can
reserve
the
use
of
its
property
for
the
conduct
of
its
business,
and
it's
not
a
public
forum.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
certainly
wasn't
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in
adderley.
the
court
in
adderley
said
when
the
government
runs
a
jail
it
can
set
a
jail
aside,
and
you
don't
have
to
have
speech
around
a
jail.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
a
moment
ago
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question
the
post
office
could
ban
all
of
these
things
and
say
we're
just
running
post
office
business
here
and
all
of
you
get
out.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
take
it
it
would
be
permissible
for
them
to
do
so,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sekulow.
mr.
roberts,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
