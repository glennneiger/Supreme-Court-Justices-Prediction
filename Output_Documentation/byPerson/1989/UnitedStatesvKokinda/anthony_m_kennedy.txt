m.
kennedy
you
mentioned
there
were
50
complaints.
do
you
think
there
would
have
been
50
complaints
if
it
were
the
red
cross?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
before
you...
you
get
on
to
that,
let's
assume
that
we
rejected
your
argument
on
vagueness.
could
you
and
would
you
argument...
argue
that
this
is
a
content-based
regulation
that's
insupportable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
you
can
narrowly
tailor
time,
place
and
manner...
manner
restrictions
to
all
post
offices
in
the
united
states
with
one
regulation,
or
are
you
advocating
that
we
have
to
have
an
office-by-office
regulation?
