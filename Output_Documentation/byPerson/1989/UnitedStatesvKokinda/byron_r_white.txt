justice
byron
r.
white
what
were
these
problems?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's...
let's
assume
that...
that
the
service,
the
postal
service
would
have
authority
to
forbid
all
of
this
kind
of
communications
that
you
now
permit.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
that...
can't
you
still
hold
this
particular
regulation
invalid
under
the
first
amendment
even
if
you
have
that
broader
authority?
what
kind
of
a
burden
have
you
got
to...
to
sustain
this
targeting
of
a
particular
kind
of
communication?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
show
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you...
you
had
a...
you
had
a
chance
to
convince
the
lower
courts
of
this,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
the
majority?
justice
byron
r.
white
who
thought
that...
that...
that
this
was
just
really
just
a
minor
bother
for
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
let's...
let's
just
assume
that
the...
that
the
court
below
was
wrong
in
saying
that
this
was
a...
that
this
sidewalk
was
a
public
forum,
a
general
public
forum
like
all
other
sidewalks.
does
that...
does
that
really
win
the
case
for
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
now,
what
is
your...
i've
asked
you
what
was
your
burden?
how
do
you
satisfy
that
burden?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
yes,
but
you...
but
the
regulation
cover...
would
cover
solicitation
anywhere
on
that
sidewalk.
justice
byron
r.
white
and/or
anywhere
else--
justice
byron
r.
white
why
couldn't
you
just
say
within
30
yards
or
20
yards
or
30
feet
of
any
entrance?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
do
you
disagree
with...
with
the
test
that
this
regulation
is
valid
if
it's
reasonable?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
it
your...
you
just
agree
with
the
fourth
circuit
that
it's
unreasonable;
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it...
i
take
it
that
you
would...
you
would
say
the
lobby
of
the
post
office
is
a
traditional
public
forum?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
the
fourth
circuit
say
it
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
they
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
say
the
regulation
is
valid
inside
the...
inside
the
lobby?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
this
regulation
the
way
it
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
answer
the
question.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no.
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
though
the
other
things
are
permitted?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
isn't...
that
isn't
our
case.
it
isn't
our
case.
now--
justice
byron
r.
white
--suppose...
suppose
the
people
involved
here
who
were
arrested
had
been
soliciting
inside
the
post
office,
inside
the
building,
and
this
case
then
came
up
to
the
fourth
circuit,
and
it
was
decided
the
same
way.
should
we
reverse...
would
we
reverse
that?
