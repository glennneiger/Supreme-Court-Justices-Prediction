mr.
roberts,
this
is
based
on
a
regulation,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
there
any
significance
in
not...
that
it
is
a
regulation
rather
than
a
statute?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
don't
cite
the...
the
authority
under
which
the
regulations
are
issued,
do
you?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
are
many
postal
facilities
like
this
one?
if
we
decide
this
case,
does
it
apply
to
bowie,
period?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you...
do
you
think
the
government's
position
would
be
the
same
or
would
have
been
the
same
had
this
been
a
red
cross
solicitation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
it
may...
maybe
it
would
apply,
but
you
started
off
by
mentioning
mr.
larouche,
and--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--i
wondered.
