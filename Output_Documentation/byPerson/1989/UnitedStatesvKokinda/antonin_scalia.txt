justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
i
guess
i
don't
understand
this.
you
mean
even...
is
the
government
conceding
that
even
when
it's
a
nonpublic
forum,
the
government
cannot
say
we
just
don't
want
any
expressive
activity,
this
is
our
property,
we
don't
want
any?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
have
a
good
reason?
i
mean,
there's
an
apron
around
this
court
in
addition
to
the
sidewalk.
it
goes
right
under
the
justices'
windows.
now,
could
the...
can
the
court
not
say
we
just
don't
want
people
there?
we
don't
care
if
they're
quiet.
we
don't
care
if
they're
passing
out
things
or
soliciting
or
whatever.
we
just
don't
want
people
there,
period.
do
we
need
a
good
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
that...
i
mean,
i
don't
see
them,
they
don't
make
any
noise.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that
is
a
good
reason
or
not
a
good
reason,
we
just
say
we
don't
want
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
can't
do
that.
every
piece
of
property
the
government
opened...
that
the
government
has
must
be
open
to
speech
unless
there's
a
good
reason
to
exclude
it.
is
that
the
principle
the
government
accepts?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
you
have
to
have
a
reason
for
discriminating
between
different
types
of...
of...
of
speech.
i
mean,
i
can
understand
perhaps
the
government
having
to
justify
why
you
can
pass
out
flyers
but
you
can't
solicit,
but
if
the
government
just
decides
we
don't
want
anybody
on
the
property
but
those
who
are
here
to
do
business,
it
has
to
give
a
reason
for
that.
whatever
the
government
owns
is
subject
to
people
coming
in
and
saying
i
want
to
talk,
it's
your
burden
to
show
that
it
is
unreasonable
for
me
to
talk.
that's
really
the
position
the
government
accepts?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
didn't
understand
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your...
but
your
vaguest
point,
that's
your
vagueness
point.
that's...
that's...
that's
not
your
content
base
point.
your
content
base
point
requires
you
to
say
that
you
cannot
distinguish
at
all
between
asking
for
money,
whether
you're
asking
for
it
right
now
or
whether
you're
asking
to
mail
it
in
three
weeks
from
now.
you
cannot
select
out
asking
for
money.
that's...
that's
a
type
of
content,
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
other
sidewalks
get
people
between
locations.
yes.
i
mean,
i
go
from
one
building
to
another.
that's
what
the
public
sidewalk
is.
this
is...
i
mean,
in
this
sense
my
doorway
is
a
public
thoroughfare.
the
public
comes
in
to
my
house
when
they
come
in.
do
we
call
that
a
public
thoroughfare?
no,
because
it
leads
only
to
my
house.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
the
same
thing
with
this
sidewalk.
it
leads
only
to
the
post
office,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
becomes
a
public
thoroughfare
because
the
public
walks
on
it.
is
that
your
principle?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
my
house
is
a
public
thoroughfare
because
members
of
the
public
come
up
to
my
door
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
privately
owned,
too.
i
mean,
the
government
has
a
property
right--
--the
government
has
a
right
to
exclude,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
us?
are
we
a
quasi-military
enclave?
do
we
have
to
allow
pamphleteering
and...
and
people
quite
silently
carrying
posters
right
outside
in
the
anteroom
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
eminently
so.
posters
protesting
that
what...
you
know,
court
decisions.
why
is
that
incompatible?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
sidewalk
right
under
the
window,
too?
you
think
we
would
have
to
let
people...
you
know,
there's
a
sidewalk
that
goes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--quite
close
to
the
building
in
addition
to
the
sidewalk
next
to
the
street
that
you
use
to
get
from
this
building
to
other
buildings.
we
would
have
to
let
people
right
next
to
the
window,
too,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
now
that's
a
very
different
argument.
now
you're
saying
this
is
just
not
an
apron;
this
is
a
public
sidewalk
in
the
sense
that...
in
the
sense
that
because
of
a
change
in
circumstances
the
old
public
sidewalk
is
no
longer
used
for
getting
from
one
building
to
another,
and
this...
this
has
become
the
public
sidewalk.
but
that's
quite
a
different
argument
from
what
you've
been
talking
about
up
until
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
would
you
make
the
same
argument
that
the...
the
apron...
i
agree,
that's
a
loaded
word...
the
sidewalk,
the
private
sidewalk
around
the
bank...
the
bank
has
a
parking
lot,
and
it's
set
back.
would
you
say
that
the
bank
now
has
to
allow
protests
on
that
section?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but...
but
we're
talking
about
whether
a
sidewalk
is
a
sidewalk.
you
wouldn't
be
arguing
that
that
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
public
sidewalk,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
not
a
difference
for
this
argument.
you...
you
engaged
in
a
discussion
with...
with
justice
o'connor,
and
justice
o'connor
said
the
mall
outside
is
government
owned
but
you're
not
allowed
to
go
on
it,
and
your
argument
was
but
the
mall
is
not
a
sidewalk.
and
this
is
a
sidewalk.
yes,
it's
set
back
from
the
street,
but
it's
still
a
sidewalk.
and
now
i
give
you
a
case
where
it's
also
a
sidewalk
from
the
bank,
and
you
say
but
no,
it's
not
a
sidewalk.
justice
antonin
scalia
now...
now
under
your
argument,
i
suppose,
the
post
office
would
also
have
to
permit
panhandlers
on
the
premises;
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
that
theory,
every
thief
is
robin
hood.
