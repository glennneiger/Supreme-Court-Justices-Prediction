mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
a
divided
panel
of
that
court
held
that
the
postal
service
regulation
prohibiting
solicitation
on
postal
premises,
in
effect
in
its
current
form
since
1978,
was
unconstitutional.
this
decision
was
contrary
to
decisions
from
the
third,
seventh,
ninth
and
eleventh
circuits.
it
is
wrong
and
should
be
reversed.
on
august
6,
1986,
the
respondents
set
up
a
table
five
to
six
feet
from
the
entrance
to
the
bowie
post
office
on
the
concrete
apron
that
surrounds
the
post
office
building
and
runs
between
the
building
and
the
post
office
parking
lot.
the
building
is
a
freestanding
building,
and
this
concrete
apron
which
functions
as
the
access
walkway
to
the
building
is
set
back
at
all
points
more
than
75
feet
from
the
city
sidewalk
and
the
public
highway
that
form
the
front
boundary
of
the
postal
property.
there
is
a
canopy
over
the
walkway
in
the
front
entrance
area.
the
walkway
is
entirely
on
postal
property.
it
serves
only
the
post
office
building
and
is
not
connected
to
the
city
sidewalk
some
75
feet
away.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
postal
service
has
construed
the
regulation
to
allow
that.
what
is
prohibited
is--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--speech
or
conduct
that
solicits
an
immediate
donation
of
charity
on
the
premises.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
on
the
spot.
the
reason
that
that
type
of
activity
is
prohibited
while
the
other
examples
that
you
mentioned
are
not
is
that
in
the
post...
postal
service's
experience
it
was
that
direct
solicitation,
seeking
an
immediate
act
of
charity
on
the
spot,
that
led
to
the
problems
it
experienced.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i...
i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
and
i
think
it
follows
from
common
sense,
as
justice
blackmun
noted
in
his
separate
opinion
in
the
heffron
case.
if
you're
walking
down
the
street
and
you
look
ahead
and
see
someone
passing
out
leaflets,
you
know
that
you
can
take
the
leaflet
and
stick
it
in
your
pocket
or
read
it
later
or
toss
in
the
nearest
trash
can.
by
the
same
token,
picketing,
which
is
permitted
on
postal
property,
if
you
look
ahead
and
you
see
someone
carrying
a
picket
sign,
you
know
that
when
you
get
there
you
can
read
the
sign
if
you
wish,
react
to
it
if
you
wish
or
just
keep
walking.
a
solicitor,
however,
seeks
to
engage
the
passerby
in
an
immediate
face-to-face
confrontation
that
has
as
its
objective
an
immediate
act
of
financial
charity.
that
type
of
conduct
is,
as
the
postal
service
found,
inherently
more
aggressive
than
leafletting
or
picketing
or
discussion,
and
it
was
that
type
of
conduct
that
the
postal
service
found
created
congestion,
impeding
patrons
in
their
transaction
of
postal
business,
and
distracted
postmasters
and
clerks
from
their
duties.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
is
not
prohibited.
the
regulations
prohibit
campaigning
for
public
office;
but,
assuming
that's
not
the
sort
of
petition
we're
talking
about,
that's
not
prohibited.
now,
i
will
agree
that
that
type
of
conduct
has
many
of
the
same
burdens
associated
with
soliciting
charity,
but,
in
fact,
the
postal
service
had
not
found
any
problem
with
that
sort
of
activity
on
postal
premises.
there
are
people
who
want
to
leaflet
on
postal
premises,
who
want
to
picket
and
who
want
to
seek
signatures
for
petitions.
it's
when
you
let
them
ask
for
money
that
the
crowds
come
out
and
that
the
problems
are
experienced.
so
in
1978
the
postal
service
narrowly
targeted
that
type
of
expressive
activity
that
was
causing
the
problem
and
prohibited
only
that.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
problems
were
congestion
at
postal
entryways,
the
distraction
of
the
postmasters
and
their
clerks
from
their
duties.
this
case
is
a
very
good
example.
on
the
day
in
question,
the
postmaster
and
his
clerks
were
compelled
to
field
40
to
50
complaints
from
customers
concerning
respondents'
activities.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
service
expressly
considered
that
alternative
in
1978.
it
determined,
given
the
fact
that
we're
talking
about
more
than
35,000
separate
facilities
around
the
country
with
various
different
architectural
configurations
and
surrounding
environments,
that
it
would
be
an
administrative
and
logistic
nightmare
to
attempt
to
draw
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions
for
each
of
those
35,000
facilities.
it
further
determined
that
it
would
be
very
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
enforce
those
sorts
of
restrictions.
most
postal
facilities
do
not
have
security
forces,
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
monitor
compliance
with
the
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions.
finally,
it
concluded
that
such
a
system,
which
would
leave
considerable
discretion
with
local
postmasters
either
in...
in
implementation
or
enforcement,
was
undesirable
given
the
far-flung
nature
of
the
commercial
enterprise
because
they
were
concerned
that
the
postmasters
would
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
viewpoint
or
content.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
is
true
that,
as
i
indicated
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
that
petition
gathering
can
have
many
of
the
same
problems
as...
as
solicitation;
but
given
the
postal
service's
experience,
it
wasn't
creating
serious
problems.
there
was--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there
is
a
prohibition
on
creating...
i
think
it's
creating
a
disturbance,
hindering,
blocking
the
entryway.
there
is,
in
fact,
that
sort
of
restriction.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
could
be
applied
to
the
activity
if
it
fell
within
the
restriction.
the
reason
the
postal
service
did
not
want
to
rely
on
such
ad
hoc
prohibitions
is
because
solicitation
was
causing
a
broader
problem
that
couldn't
be
addressed
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
the
problems
we've
talked
about
inhibiting
postal
patrons,
giving
rise
to
complaints
by
the
postal
patrons,
taking
up
the
postmaster's
time
accompanies
solicitation
that
is
not
disruptive.
it
does
not
necessarily
block
the
entrance.
the
postal
service
concluded
after
an
experience
with
limited
solicitation
that
there
wasn't
enough
room
for
everybody
who
wanted
to
solicit
on
postal
property
and
further
concluded
that
allowing
limited
solicitation
carried
with
it
more
problems
than
it
was
worth.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
not,
your
honor.
it
is
a
regulation
duly
issued
pursuant
to
authority
given
by
congress
to
the
postal
service,
and
deference
is
owed
to
the
service
in
its
interpretation
of
the
regulation,
but
i
don't
think
it
carries
any
less
weight
than
would
a
statute
regulating
these
activities.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
believe
we
do.
it's
the
act
that
transformed
the
old
post
office
department
into
the
postal
service
in
1970,
and
when
the
postal
service
enacted
these
regulations
the
objective
was
to
reduce
and...
and
to
the
extent
possible
eliminate
what
they
called
nonmission-related
burdens.
the
direction
from
congress
when
it
passed
the
postal
service
statute
was
to
run
the
post
office
as
to
the
extent
possible
like
a
business,
and
so
it
began
looking
at
what
was
permitted
and
started
to
eliminate
the
nonmission-related
duties
that
were
distracting
it
from
its
really
quite
awesome
commercial
endeavor.
the...
the
respondents
rely
before
this
court
on
what
is
essentially
a
syllogism.
they
say
that
this
access
walkway
immediately
adjacent
to
the
post
office
building,
set
well
back
from
the
sidewalk,
is
just
like
a
city
sidewalk.
city
sidewalks
are
traditional
public
forums,
and,
therefore,
this
access
walkway
must
be
a
traditional
public
forum.
but
this
walkway,
this
concrete
apron
surrounding
the
building,
is
not
just
like
a
city
sidewalk.
it's
entirely
on
postal
property,
set
well
back
from
the
sidewalk
and
the
street,
serves
only
one
building
and
is
not
connected
to
the
sidewalk
or
any
other
pedestrian
or
vehicle
thoroughfare.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
bowie
post
office
facility
is
the
pattern
that's
used
by
the
service
in
suburban
settings.
as
i
mentioned,
there
are
35,000
facilities
nationwide,
so
it's
difficult
to
generalize.
this
is
a
very
common
pattern.
it's
the
same
type,
for
example,
that
was
at
issue
in
the
third
circuit
case,
in
the
seventh
circuit
case,
the
ninth
and
the
eleventh.
it's
a
suburban
post
office,
which
is
why
you
have
to
put
the
building
well
back
from
the
street.
it's
a
busy
highway.
it's
not
a
city
street.
that's
why
people
get
there
in
their
cars
rather
than
on
foot,
which
is
why
you
need
parking.
the
majority
below
mentioned
that
first
amendment
values
could
not
be
subject
to
architectural
chicanery,
but
that's
not
what's
involved
here.
these
buildings
are
designed
this
way
to
fulfill
the
postal
service's
needs,
and
one
of
the
consequences
of
that
is
that
you're
set
well
back
from
the
traditional
forum
city
sidewalk.
now--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
court
has
applied
forum
access
to
areas
in
which
the
public
was
given
general
access.
greer,
i
suppose,
is
the
clearest
case.
it
involved
fort
dix
in
new
jersey,
but
the
streets
and
the
sidewalks
were
open
to
the
public.
and
the
court
in
several
of
its
cases,
i
believe
cornelius
most...
perhaps
most
recently
mentioned
that
the
fact
that
the
public
is
given
a
right
of
general
access
does
not
transform
the
property
into
a
public
forum.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the...
the
amici,
all
of
whom
have
an
interest
in
using
the
government's
property
for
their
own
purposes,
don't
like
the
idea
that
is
at
the
base
of
forum
analysis
that
the
government,
like
a
private
owner
of
property,
has
the
right
to
reserve
its
property
for
the
purposes
to
which
it
is
lawfully
dedicated.
that's
the
core
of
forum
analysis,
and
i
think
that
has
been
working
out
quite
well.
the
suggestion
that
the
analysis
should
be...
be
junked
and
replaced
with
sort
of
a
general
"why
not"
approach,
why
can't
we
do
this,
shifts
the
burden
completely.
it...
it
takes
away
the
notion
underlying
the
landmark
adderley
decision
that
the
government
has
rights
with
respect
to
its
property
and
shifts
the
burden
to
the
government
to
justify
why
it's
imposing
a
restriction.
the
government
restricts
the
access
to
the
extent
in
the
activities
involved
once
you
have
access
here
because
this
property
is
dedicated
to
the
postal
service's
use,
not
as
a
forum
for
expressive
activity.
now
if,
in
fact,
this--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--absolutely,
your
honor.
this
is
not
in
any
way
a
viewpoint-based
restriction.
it
applies
equally
to
the
red
cross
as
to
the
respondents--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
don't--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't...
i
did
not,
actually,
i
don't
think,
mention
who
the
respondents
were.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i...
i
can't
say
that
there
would
be.
probably...
probably
not.
i
readily
admit
that
some
of
the
complaints
were
probably
based
on
exactly
what
it
was
the
respondents
were
saying,
but
there's
no
indication
that
any
of
them
in
fact
were
based
on
that.
in
fact,
the
one
complaint
we
know
about,
the
woman
said
she
thought
it
wasn't
fair
because
they
don't
let
them
sell
girl
scout
cookies
there,
which
indicates
at
least
in
bowie
that
the
solicitation
ban
is
being
enforced
without
regard...
without
regard
to
content.
it
is,
in
fact,
your
honor,
the
problem
that
you
allude
to
that
perhaps
they
would
bend
the
rules
for
the
sort
of
organizations
that
are
more
popular,
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
the
service
didn't
want
to
allow
limited
solicitation,
because
they
thought
they
couldn't
police
that
effectively
throughout
the
nation.
that's
one
reason
they
adopted
the
general
ban.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
burden
under
the
nonpublic
forum
is
to
show
that
the
regulation
is
a
reasonable
one.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
postal
service
when
it
adopted
this
ban
on
solicitation,
it
noted
in
the
federal
register
announcement
it
was
expressly
allowing
these
other
activities,
leafletting
and
picketing,
and
it
explained
what
the
difference
was
between
solicitation
and
those
other
forms
of
activities.
solicitation
first
and
foremost
was
the
activity
that
was
causing
problems.
the
other
types
of
activities
were
not
causing
problems,
so
they
didn't
see
a
reason
to
prohibit
them.
solicitation
is
a
more
intrusive,
more
aggressive
form
of
speech.
as
i've
mentioned,
the
solicitor
tries
to
stop
you
and
get
an
answer
from
you
right
there
on
the
spot.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
we've
been
successful
in
the,
as
i've
indicated,
third,
seventh,
ninth,
eleventh
circuits,
and
we
persuaded
judge
widener
below.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
not...
not
the
two
judges
in
the
majority.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
their
analysis,
first
of
all,
was
that
this...
the
concrete
apron,
the
access
walkway,
was
a
public
forum,
and
once
they
reached
that
conclusion,
of
course,
that's
a
much
heavier
burden
for
the
postal
service
to
carry.
i
would
note
that
the
seventh
circuit
concluded
that
the
service
could
carry
the
burden
even
if
this
walkway
were...
this
type
of
walkway
were
a
public
forum.
the
conclusion,
though,
that
it
is
a
public
forum
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
decisions.
if
this
type
of
property
were
a
traditional
public
forum,
one,
in
justice
roberts'
words,
that
was
immemorially
or
time
out
of
mind
set
aside
for
expressive
activities,
we
would
expect
at
least
a
few
decisions
from
this
court
so
holding.
but
in
fact,
all
of
the
decisions
of
this
court
with
one
arguable
exception
concerning
activities
on
sidewalks,
streets,
involved
sidewalks
or
streets
on
the
perimeter
of
the
government
property
forming
the
boundary.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
it
is
a
nonpublic
forum,
the
service
need
only
show
that
its
regulation
is
viewpoint
neutral--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--which
it
clearly
is,
and
a
reasonable
one.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
show
that
it's
reasonable,
the
first
thing
they
have
to
do,
i
suppose,
is
show
why
solicitation
is
different
from
these
other
activities.
they
allow
leafletting
and
picketing.
why
not
allow
solicitation?
and
the
reason
is
based
on
experience.
this
isn't
speculation.
they
allowed
solicitation
prior
to
1978,
very
limited
and
subject
to
discretion;
but
they
allowed
it.
and
the
experience
was,
as
they
said,
highly
unsatisfactory.
too
many
people
wanted
to
use
postal
facilities.
postmasters
were
distracted
from
their
duties
in
administering
a
system
of
selective
access.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
both...
both
inside
and
outside.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
certainly
true
that
the
most
serious
problem
was
within
the
postal
lobbies,
but
the
regulation
is
not
limited
in
that
respect.
it
applies
by
its
terms
to
all
real
property
under
the
charge
and
control
of
the
post
office.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think
there's
any
functional
significance...
difference.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
referred
to
in
the

register

the
federal
register
notice
does
concern
the
postal
lobbies.
it
also
mentions,
though...
i'm
not
sure
if
it's
in
the
proposal
or
in
the
final
enactment...
entranceways.
and
this
is
the
sort...
this
access
walkway
as
far
as
the
danger
for
disruption
and
congestion
is
not
different
from
the
postal
lobby,
and,
in
fact,
there
may
be
more
room
in
the
lobby
once
you
get
past
the
entryway
through
which
all
the
patrons
must
pass.
this
is
a
covered
walkway
right
at
the
front
through
which
all
patrons
going
in
the
building
have
to
pass.
solicitation--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
depends
on
the
configuration
of
the
lobby;
and,
of
course,
i
suppose
that
solicitation
would
be
off
to
a
side
away
from
the
lines.
but
the
solicitors
in
this
case
picked
this
spot
because
it's
where
they
could
get
everybody
going
in
and
get
them
going
out.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
parking
lot.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
and
it's
not
overbroad
for
that
reason
because
we're
dealing--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
for
the
reason
the
postal
service
stated
when
it
adopted
these,
is
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
craft
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions
for
every
single
one
of
the
35,000
post
offices
around
the
country;
and,
therefore--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--a
possibility,
your
honor,
and
one
that
they
considered
and
expressly
rejected
because
they
did
not
want
to
have
the
postmasters
having
that
discretion
for,
i
think,
largely
the
reason
justice
blackmun
referred
to.
the
pressure
on
the
postmaster
to
allow
the
red
cross
and
the
girl
scouts
to
solicit--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
some
entrances
may
not
stretch
that
far,
and
there
is
no
requirement
on
the
postal
service
that
it
adopt
narrowly
tailored
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
a
limited
public
forum
in
the
sense
that
the
postal
service
doesn't
prohibit
leafletting,
picketing,
other
activities,
but
it
has
not
expressly
opened
up
the
sidewalk
to
those
activities.
there
may
be
a
difference
there.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
analysis
is
no
different,
your
honor,
as--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--still
just
reasonable
because
solicitation
is
not
one
of
the
activities
as
to
which
the
postal
service
has
opened
up
the
forum.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
you've
given
a
good
reason,
because
it
passes
right
under
the
justices'
window.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
nonpublic
forum.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i...
i
think
not.
i
think--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
test
for
a
nonpublic
forum
is,
first
of
all,
that
it
must
be
viewpoint
neutral,
and,
second
of
all,
that
the
regulation
must
be
reasonable,
yes,
and
the
government
does
accept
that
test.
now
it
doesn't,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
cornelius
opinion,
it
just
has
to
be
a
reasonable
regulation.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
the
most
reasonable
one.
it
doesn't
have
to
be,
for
example,
specifically
tailored
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
because
it's
a
nonpublic
forum
assuming
the
service
came
up
with
a
reason
for
limiting
leafletting
and
picketing.
in
its
experience,
those--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
if
that
has
been
the
experience.
that
has
not
been
the
experience.
they
have
indicated
in
1978
that
that's
not
a
problem,
so
we're
not
going
to
prohibit
it.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
it
does
become
a
problem--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we're
free
to
eliminate
it,
and--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
no.
i
wouldn't
say
three
or
four,
but
i
think,
as
the
courts
mentioned,
the
service
is
entitled
to...
to
enact
its
regulations
with
the
generality
of
the
cases
in
mind.
if
it
becomes
a
serious
problem,
i
think
they
have
the
authority
on
this
nonpublic
forum
to
respond.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's...
that
sort
of
regulation
clearly
is
reasonable.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right,
your
honor,
because
the...
even
in
a
nonpublic
forum--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the
cases
that
establish
the
standard
for
a
nonpublic
forum.
perry
states
that
in
a
nonpublic
forum
the
restriction
must
be
viewpoint
neutral
and
reasonable.
and
again,
it's
not
the
most
reasonable
regulation
you
can
imagine.
there's
no
least
restrictive
alternative
approach,
but
you
have
to
come
up
with
a
reason
for
restricting
the
expressive--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
it's
very
close
to
that,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
government
is...
is
satisfied
with
the
public
forum
doctrine
as
it's
been
established,
which
requires
that
the
regulation--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we'd
be
happy
with...
with
one
that
didn't
have...
that
we
didn't
have
to
give
a
reason
at
all,
but
certainly
in
this
case
the
reasons
that
have
been
given
by
the
postal
service--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
right,
and
you
can
restrict
as...
as
any
business
can
access
to
the
premises--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
think
there
has
to
be
some
connection
between
the
restriction
and
what's
going
on.
if
it's
a
place
of
government
business,
i
think
that's
enough
of
a
reason
to
restrict
access
to
those
who
don't
have
business
there.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
justice
blackmun,
the
cite
for
the
authority
to
issue
these
regulations
is
39
u.s.c.,
section
401,
subsection
2
in
the
postal
service
act.
the
distinction
between
the
interior
and
the
exterior
is
one
that
the
postal
service
did
not
adopt
in
issuing
these
regulations.
permitting
solicitation
on
the
outside
carries
many
of
the
same
administrative
problems
that
would
accompany
permitting
solicitation
in
the
postal
lobbies.
certainly
where
you're
talking
about
solicitation
as
in
this
case
where
the
people
go,
which
is
the
entranceway,
it
carries
at
least
the
same
degree
of
problems.
and
as
the
court
articulated
in
the
cornelius
case,
the
government
doesn't
have
to
wait
until
havoc
is
wreaked
to
act
in
restricting
access
with
respect
to
a
nonpublic
forum.
i
understood
my
brother
to
concede
that
if
the
postal
service
eliminated
all
extraneous
activities
and
barred
all
sorts
of
expression,
there
would
be
no
constitutional
objection.
i
take
that
concession
to
be
somewhat
inconsistent
with
an
argument
that
this
is
a
traditional
public
forum,
and
i
take
it
to
mean
that
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
limited
public
forum.
but
again,
as
the
court
has
made
clear,
in
a
limited
public
forum
selective
access
does
not
mean
that
everyone
has
the
right
to
come
and
go
and
do
whatever
activities
they
wish.
the
government
can
preserve
the
property
under
its
control
for
the
purposes
to
which
it
is
dedicated.
thank
you.
