mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions
are
the
means
whereby
the
balance
is
struck
between
expressive
activity
and
public
convenience.
yet,
rather
than
enacting
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions,
the
postal
service
determined
that
it
would
be
more
efficient,
if
you
will,
to
eliminate
a
protected
form
of
free
speech
rather
than
to
regulate
it.
there
are
existing
regulations
that
the
postal
service
currently
has
which
prohibits
obstruction,
interference
with
postal
patrons,
interference
with
postal
employees
in
the
performance
of
their
duties.
what
has
happened
in
this
particular
case
is
that
a
classic
form
of
political
speech,
as
judge
wilkinson
referred
to
it,
was
eliminated
strictly
because
the
government
in
its
discretion
said
it
would
be
too
complicated
to
regulate
it;
and
it
is
the
elimination
of
free
speech
that
these
people
were
convicted
for,
if
you
will.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
think
that--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--well,
we
agree
with
the
fourth
circuit
in
this
context,
justice
white,
and
that
is,
that
this
activity
took
place
on
a
traditional
public
forum,
and
the
reason
set
forth
by
the
postal
service
for
enforcing
this
prohibition
did
not
reach
the
level
of,
in
this
particular
case,
compelling
interest.
but
we
would
also
say
it
would
not
reach
a
reasonable--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--no,
i
would
not
say
it
was
a
traditional
public
forum.
and
in
fact--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--no,
they
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
the
fourth
circuit
determined
that
the
regulation,
as
applied
to
the
sidewalk,
now
called
an
apron,
is
in
fact
a
traditional
public
forum,
and
that
the
prohibition
was
not
narrowly
tailored,
not
that
it
was
not
justified
by
compelling
interest.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
a
complete
prohibition?
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
think
that
a
line
could
be
drawn;
however,
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
think,
yes,
a
complete
ban
on--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--on
the
solicitation--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--inside
the
lobby
can
be
justified--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--well,
that's--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes.
not
with
the
recent
announcement
that
automatic
teller
machines
can
now
be
placed
inside
all
these
postal
lobbies.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
think
that...
i
think
a
blind
can
be
drawn
at
that
point--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--no.
i
think
this
court
can
still
affirm
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
both
on
the
forum
ground
and,
as
well,
on
vagueness
grounds
as
we
asserted
in
our
brief;
that
is,
that
what
is
solicitation,
as
justice
o'connor
alluded
to
earlier
in
the
argument,
is
a
question.
what
is
it?
is
it
the
immediate
solicitation
and
donation
of
funds
that
is
on
postal
premises?
is
it
requesting
it?
is
it
exhorting
the
benefits
of
one's
organization?
and
in
comparing
that
test
and
the
government
now
stating
that,
well,
what
we're
really
talking
about
in
solicitation
is
a
request
for
an
immediate
exchange
of
money
to
take
place
on
the
postal
premises
may
not
be
what
happened
in
the
district
court
and
may
not
have
been
the
type
of
solicitation
that
was
taking
place.
but
we
find
and
we
feel
that
the
sidewalk
surrounding
this
particular
postal
facility
is
functionally
indistinguishable
from
any
other
sidewalk.
that
is--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes,
i
would...
i
would...
we
would
argue
that
even
inside
the
lobby
it
would
be
of
course
content
based,
that
is,
the
words
being
uttered
by
the
particular
individuals,
the
defendants
in
the
lower
court,
and,
of
course,
the
respondents
here.
the
determination
of
whether
there's
been
a
violation
of
this
particular
regulation
is
based
entirely
upon
the
content
of
what
they
state.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
it's...
it's...
in
effect,
it
is
a--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--that's
the
way--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--we
would
take
it
one
step
further,
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
compelling
interest
test
would
still
have
to
apply
here
because
a
particular
type
of
expression,
as
justice
white
said
in
the
grace
case,
has
been
eliminated
from
this
particular
forum,
and
that
is,
there
does
have
to
be
a
line
drawn
if
you
will
where
the
activities
should
not
take
place.
and
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
again,
as
i
stated,
was
the
sidewalk.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
think
it's...
it's
content
neutral
in...
to
the
extent
that
it
is
being
applied
across
the
board.
however,
they're
prohibit...
it's
the
statement
on
the
speech
is
not...
the
way
the
government
is
interpreting
solicitation
under
the
regulation
is
not
content
neutral
because
they
are
making
a
determination
based
on
the
words
uttered
whether,
in
fact,
an
illegal
solicitation
has
taken
place
or
a
legal
solicitation
has
taken
place.
and
that
is,
if
there's
an
immediate
request
for
funds
right
now,
in
the
government's
view,
a
illegal
solicitation
has
taken...
but
if
i
say
i
would
like
you
to
donate
to
my
organization
and
you
can
see
my
friend
on
the
sidewalk
around
the
corner
or
the
municipal
sidewalk
or
mail
it
in,
that
now
under
the
government's
interpretation--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes,
that
is,
and
that
is
our
position,
and
that
is
what
one
would
have
to
look
at.
it's
to
the
type
of
speech
taking
place,
the
content
of
those
words
as
to
whether
in
fact
a
solicitation
has
taken
place.
and
in
this
context
of
this
case,
i
wanted
to
briefly
mention
the...
what
was
alluded
to
by
mr.
roberts,
the
40
or
50
complaints.
as
the
court
below
stated,
those
complaints
might
well
have
been
related
to
the
viewpoint
of
these
particular
respondents.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
other
than
the
statement
from
postal
patron
wyatt
about
the
girl
scouts
as
to
what
the
nature
of
these
particular
complaints
were.
and
in
fact,
implementing
a
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restriction
rather
than
eliminating
the
speech
for
a
forum
would
prove
to
be
a
workable
and
constitutionally
required
method
to
control
this
public
convenience
and
government
ownership
situation.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
think
the--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes.
i
think
the
government...
the
postal
service
could
create
a
quasi-military
enclave,
if
you
will.
however,
they
have
not
chosen
to
do
so--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--because
the
postal
service
as
now
operating
in
the
bowie,
maryland
post
office,
justice
o'connor,
is
allowing
a
vast
array
of
activities.
the
invitation
to
conduct
postal
business
is
not...
the
invitation
to
come
onto
the
premises
is
not
for
just
postal
business.
it
has
not
created
this
enclave--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--what
i
was
referring
to,
justice
o'connor,
was
the
function
as
to
how
the
post
office
operates.
the
way
they
operate
now,
the
postal
system
operates
now,
it
is
not
an
enclave
immune
from
the
first
amendment.
there
is,
in
addition
to
the
utilization
of...
of
distributing
literature
and
the
peaceful
picketing,
there
are
other
activities
that
take
place
at
the
postal
service,
and
it
is
a
public
thoroughfare.
this
sidewalk,
it
can
be
referred
to
as
a
concrete
apron
or
a
walkway,
but
it
is
a
public
thoroughfare
to
get
someone
from
one
point
to
another
point.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--well,
it's
a
public
thoroughfare,
chief
justice,
no
different
than
any
other
municipal
sidewalk;
and
that
is
that
it's
to
a
public
thoroughfare
for
people
to
move
to
get
to
a
location.
the
fact
that
one--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--oh,
yes,
but
the
post
office--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--oh,
i
think
that's
absolutely
part
of
the...
the
analysis.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
your
house,
justice
scalia,
i
assume
is
privately
owned,
and
you
have
that
right
to
exclude.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
the
government
has
a
right
to
exclude.
however,
general
public
access
is
not
even
really
at
issue
in
this
case,
chief
justice.
what
is
at
issue
is
the
general
public
has
the
right
to
be
there.
there's
no
question
that
they
can
be
there
for
postal
business
or
for
nonpostal
business.
the
invitation
to
come
to
the
postal...
post
office
in
bowie,
maryland
is
no
more
limited
to
those
on
postal
business
really
than
was
the
invitation
to
come
to
the
los
angeles
international
airport
limited
to
those
on
airport-related
business.
it
is
a
general
public
asset
situation,
and
since
that
access
exists
the
government
would
have
to
put
forth
a
compelling
interest,
is
our
position,
justifying
the
exclusion.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
not
in
the
building,
your
honor.
outside
on
a
public
sidewalk
open
to
the
general
public.
there
is--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--the
postal
service
themselves,
in
adopting
the
regulation
prohibiting
the
solicitation
of
funds,
specifically
addressed
itself
to
the
problems
that
are
associated
inside
the
lobbies,
the
cramped
areas,
and
that
is
a
compatibility
factor.
that
the
activity
taking
place
inside
the
public
forum,
inside
the
post
office,
would
not
be
compatible
with
its...
the
efficient
operation
of
that
particular
facility.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
think
that
argument
could
be
made
that
in
fact
the
public...
that
a
compelling
interest
keeping
solicitation
outside
of
the
busy
areas
of
the
postal
office
inside,
yes,
could
be
met,
but
that
would
not
apply
to
the
outside
areas
open
to
the
general
public
for
any
purpose
or
for
no
purpose
at
all,
for
postal-related
business
or
nonpostal
related.
yes,
a
different
set
of...
a
different
situation
exists
inside
versus
outside.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
oh,
even
then,
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
it
could
be
banned.
but
implementing
a
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restriction
prohibiting
maybe
that
activity
from
taking
place
at
the
peak
hours
or
during
congestion--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--perhaps
a
booth
rule
would
suffice
inside
the
post
office
on
a
first
come,
first
served
basis.
the
experience
that
the
postal
service
had,
obviously
i'm
not
trying
to
argue
their
point,
is
that
inside
the
postal
facility
they
were
having
sufficient
congestion
problems
where
the
operation
of
the
forum
was
being
affected.
that
does
not
exist
outside--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes,
excuse
me,
the
post
office.
but
in
this
particular
situation
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
solicitation
of
funds
outside
the...
on
the
postal
sidewalk
is
prohibiting
the
operation
of
the
facility
for
postal
purposes.
the
test
cannot
be
met,
either
a
compelling
interest
or
even
a
significant
interest.
in
fact,
we
would
go
one
step
further,
as
the
court
had
alluded
to,
that
even
a
reasonable...
requirement
of
a
reasonable
regulation
here
would
not
be
met
because
there
is
no
evidence
that
outside
the
particular
sidewalk
in
these
particular
post
office
that
there
is
this
problem
of
such
huge
proportion
justifying
the
elimination
of
this
protected
activity
taking
place
here.
again,
the
complaints
that
were
made
might
well,
as
the
court
below
stated,
be
dealing
specifically
with
viewpoint
of
the
particular...
respondents'
particular
political
views.
but
yet
it
was
classic
political
speech
that
was
being
exercised
outside.
the
aspect
i
think
that's
important
to
draw
the
distinction...
and
i
think
the
postal
service
really
did
this...
is
that
they
were
concerned
with
solicitation
taking
place
really
inside
the
lobbies.
that
was
where
the
experience
was
a
problem.
the
prohibition
outside
the...
outside
the
interior
of
the
postal
service
onto
the
public
access
sidewalk
here
was
more
of
a
ad
hoc
decision,
in
our
opinion,
than--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
think
they
could,
and
if
they
could
justify
the
prohibition
outside
and
meet
the
compelling
interest
test,
then--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--because
a
particular
type
of
speech,
chief
justice,
has
been
eliminated
from
a
public
forum,
and
that--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--we
believe
this
case
is
distinguishable
from
greer
and
from
adderley.
in
greer
it
was
the
special
constitutional
function
of
the
military
that
was
the
primary
concern
when
this
court
said
the
free
speech
activities
could
not
take
place
inside
the
military
enclave.
in
adderley,
in
that
particular
situation
the
charge
that
the
individuals
were
charged
with
here
was
a
trespass
charge,
and
they
were
deemed
to
have
blocked
an
area
not
open
to
the
public
for
general
use.
that
is
not
what
exists
at
the
bowie
post
office--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--and
that
was
because
of
the
security
concerns
of
the
jail,
and
it
was
speech
taking
place,
chief
justice,
in
areas
that
were
not
open
to
the
general
public.
and
here,
there
has
not
been
this
reservation
of
use.
rather,
the
postal
service
has
invited
the
public
in
for
postal
services
and
nonpostal
services,
for
the
distribution
of
literature,
for
peaceful
picketing,
for
petitioning
for
signatures.
yet
they've
singled
out
solicitation
outside.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
oh,
they
could
ban
it
if
in
fact
they
operated
as
this
quasi-military
enclave,
but
they
do
not,
chief
justice.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
they
would
have
to
show
the
constitutional
requirement
being
met,
that
the
postal
service
was
so
important
to
national
interest,
as
the
military
was,
to
justify
it.
the
argument
might
well
be
made,
but
the
postal
service
is
not
at
that
point
of
being
a
quasi-military
enclave.
they
have
not
reached
that
point.
in
fact,
they're
increasing
their
invitation
rather
than
limiting
their
invitation.
they're
not
limiting
it
to
postal
service
business--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
think
the
compatibility
factor
that
would
justify
a
prohibition
of
that.
we're
not
saying
that
one
who
is
rightfully
in
a
place
can
distribute
his
literature
anywhere
just
because
he
has
that
invitation.
there
is
that
compatibility
factor
that
this
court
looked
at
in
grayned.
is
that
particular
speech
compatible
with
what's
taking
place,
in
this
particular
case,
inside
the
forum?
but
certainly,
those
distributing--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--well,
i
think
if
it
was...
i
think
it
would
be
incompatible
in
the
sense
of
the
judicial
decorum
and
the
courtroom
decorum
that
takes
place
in
the
chambers
and
inside
of
this
courtroom,
but
that
is
not
the
case
where
you've
got
general
public
access
unlimited
for
any
business
at
all.
one
is
not
invited
to
the
supreme
court
building
other
than
of
course
tours
and
whatnot
for
just
any
business.
it's
a
courtroom
dedicated
to
a
specific
function
and
is
operating
more
distinct,
if
you
will.
however,
free
speech
activities
outside
on
the
sidewalks
around
this
court
were
protected
and
were
deemed
to
be
areas
within
first
amendment
protection.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
think,
yes,
you
would,
but
for
this
condition.
i
want
to
draw
a
distinction--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--in
grace--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--in
grace,
the...
the
court
did
indicate
that
the
plaza...
it
was
not...
i
don't
think
it
was
a
complete
decision
on
that
point...
was
maybe
not
open
to
the
forum
like
the
sidewalks,
but
i
think--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--and
in
grace--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes,
they
are.
absolutely.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
on
the
plaza
level,
i
think
the
argument
can
be
made
that
you
draw
the
line
there
and
don't
have
to,
but
there's
a
distinction
between
this
court's
physical
setup,
if
you
will,
and
that
of
the
post
office,
and
here's
the
point.
that
is,
one
who
is
entering
into
this
building
must
use
the
municipal
sidewalk
to
enter
into
the
building.
that
is,
to
come
into
this
building
as
a
public
visitor,
one
must
use
the
sidewalk
surrounding
it.
at
the
bowie
post
office,
most
people
drive
in,
and
it
is
that
access
sidewalk
is
the
only
means
whereby
people
are
going
to
get
out
of
their
car
for
the
most
part
and
walk
on
into
the
facility.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i...
i
wouldn't
think
so,
justice
scalia,
in
this
context,
again.
that
is,
the
design
was...
it
was
an
intentional
design
by
the
post
office
to
set
the
area
back
from
the
main
street
mostly
because
of
the
concerns
with
traffic
on
these
main
streets,
so
setting
it
back
allowing
parking,
a
parking
lot
to
be
a
place
between
the
municipal
sidewalk,
which
the
fourth
circuit
said
is
not
a
reasonable
alternative
means
of
communication,
and
the
public
access
sidewalk.
and
that...
our
position
is
that
sidewalk...
the
intervening
parking
lot
does
not
create...
create
a
first
amendment
moat,
if
you
will,
which
all
of
a
sudden
announces
to
someone
that
they're
on
a
special
enclave
and
free
speech
activities
stop
as
if
to
have
one's
constitutional
rights
shed
as
they
walked
out
of
their
car
and
onto
the
only
sidewalk
to
get
in
and
out
of
that
building.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
absolutely
not.
it's
a
completely
different
situation.
the
united
states
is
subject
to
the
mandates
and
the
protections
of
the
first
amendment.
a
bank,
in
private
capacity,
would
not
be,
and
i
think
that's
the
distinction.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
would
be
arguing
that
in
that
particular
case
it
is
not
governmentally
owned,
although
i
wouldn't
be
arguing
that
if
i
was
up
here
on
that
case,
obviously,
but
if
it's
not
governmentally
owned.
and
that
is
the
difference.
and
that
is
the
first
amendment
mandates
are
to
the
state
action
sufficient--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--it's
a...
it's
a
privately
owned
piece
of
sidewalk,
if
you
will.
it
is
privately
owned.
the
mandates
and
the
protections
of
the
first
amendment,
this
court
has
not
required
those
to
exist
onto
private
property
owners.
while
a
government
can
treat
its
property
as
a
private
owner
of
that
property,
it
has
not
chosen
to
do
so
here,
and
that
is,
it's
publicly
owned,
the
general
public
is
invited,
and
their...
their
invitation,
as
i
stated
earlier,
was
not
limited
to
postal
business
only.
that
is
not
the
situation--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
think
yes,
that
that
activity,
the
district
court
in
new
york
recently
addressed
that
and
said
that
that
was
a
protected
form
of
speech,
again,
though,
subject
to
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions.
and
what
the
government
has
chosen
to
do
in
this
particular
case
is
eliminate
the
speech
for
efficiency
reasons
rather
than
narrowly
tailoring
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions.
and--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
think
that
there
are,
from
what
we
understand,
two
basic
designs
to
post
offices,
and
some
exist
immediately
adjacent
to
municipal
sidewalks,
which,
of
course,
the
government
concedes
would
be
protected
speech,
and
others
that
are
set
back.
and
i
think
a
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restriction
could
be
uniformly
adopted,
and
that
is
what
i
think
the
constitution
requires,
and
that's--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--well,
i
don't--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
don't
think
necessarily
commercial
speech
would
be,
and
the
court--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--the
court
in
new
york,
the
district
court,
said
it
was
in
fact
charity.
it
was
an
individual
solicitation
for
a
very
personal
charity
but
a
charity
nonetheless,
and
they
held
it
to
be
a...
a
charitable
solicitation
no
different
than
what
our
respondents
were...
entered
into.
i
haven't
digested
how
far
we
take
that
argument,
obviously,
but
that
is
what
the
court
in
the
district
said,
that
that
personal
solicitation
for
their
personal
interest
was
a
form
of
charity
indistinguishable
than
any
other
charitable
contribution.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
well,
i...
that's
correct,
chief...
justice
scalia.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
well,
we
had...
we
had
the
right
in
this...
in
this
sense.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
but...
but
clearly
i
think
a
booth
rule,
as
justice
o'connor
alluded
to,
would
be
constitutionally
sufficient,
which
could
eliminate
the
table
and
any
potential
blocking
problems.
but
that's
not
what
the
government
has
chosen
to
do
here.
what
they've
chosen
to
do
instead
was
to
eliminate
entirely
this
speech
from
this
sidewalk,
the
sidewalk
which
is
the
only
way
into
this
building.
it
is
the
access
way.
there
is
no
mall
separation
in
the
context
of
someone
coming
off
the
municipal
sidewalk
onto
the
mall.
i
think
that's
a
distinction
here,
and
that
is
basically
the
way
to
get
into
the
post
office.
the
way
this
particular
facility
was
designed
was
that
the
entranceway
in
is
that
public
sidewalk.
you
exit
your
car,
come
out
to
your
car
and
get
onto
the
sidewalk
to
get
into
the
building
for
postal
reasons,
as
i
said,
or
for
nonpostal
reasons.
the
situation
that
exists
at
bowie,
maryland,
and
these
respondents
were
convicted
and
sentenced
to
jail
for
doing
something
that
they
would
be
entitled
to
if
it
was
abutting
a
municipal
sidewalk.
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
first
amendment
cannot...
a
moat
cannot
be
created
by
this
intervening
parking
lot
to
eliminate
first
amendment
activities.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
there
are
regulations
in
some
municipalities
that
prohibit
tables
because
of
the
obstruction.
and
again,
those
regulations
are
in
existence
which
could
prohibit
obstructing
the
pedestrian
flow
of
traffic.
but
these
defendant...
respondents
were
not
charged
with
that.
they
were
charged
with
soliciting.
what
our
position
is
is
that
the
right
to
solicit,
what's
been
referred
to
by
the
court
below
as
classic
political
speech,
is
not
subject
to
the
grace
of
government,
to
an
architectural
design
or
to
a
fluke
of
history.
thank
you.
