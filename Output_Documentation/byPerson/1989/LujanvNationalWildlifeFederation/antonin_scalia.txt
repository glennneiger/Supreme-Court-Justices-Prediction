justice
scalia
well,
mr.
roberts,
it...
it
would
have
an
effect
nationwide,
however,
if
all
of
the...
if
all
of
the
actions
taken
nationwide
were
subject
to
this
court
of
appeals
rule
of
law.
that
is
to
say,
if
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
were
to
hold
that
you
had
to
make
the
additional
publications
that
are
alleged
to
have
been
necessary
in
this
case,
and
if
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
had
jurisdiction
over
every
order
issued
nationwide,
then
presumably
the
government
would
have
to
comply
to
that...
with
that
order
and...
with
that
view
of
the
law
unless
we
took
cert.
of
the
case,
right?
justice
scalia
i
understand
that.
justice
scalia
and
if
it
doesn't,
then...
then
presumably
those
that
are
challenged
in
the...
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
will
be
governed
by
that
rule,
but
the
government
can
feel
free
to
use
its
view
of
the
law
elsewhere?
justice
scalia
it's
not
really
harmless
error
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
say,
well,
we
really
only
have
this
one
case
before
us
but,
nonetheless,
it
applies
to
all
cases?
justice
scalia
respondent
says,
mr.
roberts,
that
it
had
had
no
reason
to
believe
it
would
need
anything
further
until
the...
until
the
court
at
the
last
minute
suddenly
decided
to
take
seriously
the...
the
challenges
to
standing
which
hadn't
previously
been...
been
even
barely
acknowledged
by
it.
justice
scalia
that
was
several
years...
when
was
their
affidavit?
that...
their
affidavit
had
been
some
time
before.
justice
scalia
how...
how
much
before
the
time
that
they
were
updating
it?
justice
scalia
and
the
hearing
was
when?
justice
scalia
'76
to
'88?
justice
scalia
'86
to
'88,
so
you
were
using
figures
for
two
years
earlier?
justice
scalia
well,
and--
justice
scalia
well,
the
government's
point
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
standing.
i
mean,
it
was
a
totally
different
point.
the
government's
affidavit
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
standing
issue
we're
talking
about
here,
right?
justice
scalia
with
the
case.
with
the
case,
but
not
with
the
standing
issue
that
we're
talking
about
here.
justice
scalia
how
can
you
rule
on
the
merits
in
ruling
on
standing?
i--
justice
scalia
--well,
no,
he
didn't.
i
mean,
if
the
case
was
dismissed
on
standing
he
certainly
didn't
rule
on
the
merits.
he
might
have
said
something
about
the
merits,
but
it's
just
not
a
ruling.
justice
scalia
well,
yes,
but
we...
we
don't
review
dicta,
and
if
this
case
was
dismissed
on
standing,
you
know
that
that's
no
precedent.
justice
scalia
so
to
rebut
those
affidavits.
you
came
in
and
said
there's
standing,
which
is
a
totally
different
point.
so
you're
saying
there
were
two
wrongs
here.
would
it
suffice
to...
to
remedy
the
injustice
if,
in
reversing
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
here,
our
opinion
said,
moreover,
when
this
goes
back
don't
let
the
government's
affidavit
in,
or
you
shouldn't
have
let
the
government's
affidavit
in?
justice
scalia
or
you
are
sanctioned
and
reprimanded
for
letting...
and
then
the
inequity
would
be
eliminated,
i
assume?
justice
scalia
what
you're
talking...
i
don't
know
what
you're
talking
about.
that...
those
are
the
lands
that
were
adversely
affected,
in
your
view,
by
the
order
that
you're
challenging?
justice
scalia
but
what's
relevant
is
what
greater
parcel
were
those
lands
contained
in
that
were
described
in
the
affidavits,
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
and...
and
that
describes
those
4,400--
justice
scalia
--and
how
many
acres
is
the
south
pass
and
green
mountain
area?
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
so
it's
4,400
acres
that
are
somewhere
in
156,000
acres?
justice
scalia
in
the
whole
150,000
acres,
mr.
prettyman,
or
just--
justice
scalia
--in
whatever
particular
one
of
the
4,400
acres
that
these
activities
were
going...
going
on
in?
justice
scalia
right.
but
we
don't
know
where
that
is
among--
justice
scalia
--we
know
that
it's
somewhere
in
those,
you
say,
150,000
acres.
justice
scalia
in
the
vicinity
of
which
this...
this
affiant
said
she
recreated.
justice
scalia
what's
relevant
is
not
whether
we
can
tell
from
the
federal
register
but
whether
we
can
tell
from
her
affidavit.
all
she
says
is
that
she
is
in
the
vicinity
of
the
150,000
acres,
and
you're
telling
me
that
the
government
has
acknowledged
that
somewhere
on
4,400
acres
in
those
156,000,
all
of
which
she
may
not
have
been
near,
there
has
been
an
adverse
impact.
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
say
she's
in
the
vicinity
of
the
4,400
acres.
she
says
she's
in
the
vicinity
of
the
150,000...
where
does
she
say
that
she's
in
the
vicinity
of
the
4,400?
justice
scalia
read
the
portion
of
her
affidavit
that
indicates
that.
where
will
we
find
her
affidavit,
mr.
prettyman?
justice
scalia
suppose
i
said
the...
the
bureau
is
allowing
mining
in
the
united
states.
my...
and
then
i
track
this...
my
recreational
use
and
aesthetic
enjoyment
of
the
united
states
is
affected
by
that
mining
that
has
been
allowed.
would
that...
would
that
establish
a
standard?
justice
scalia
but
it's...
you're
saying
it's
the
other
side
of
150,000
acres?
justice
scalia
yes,
but
all
the
one
person
would
have
to
say...
i
mean,
all...
all
that
would
have
been
necessary
is
that
paragraph
3
of
the
affidavit
instead
of
saying
generally
i
use
the
federal
lands,
including
those
in
the
vicinity...
in
the
vicinity
of
the
south
pass/green
mountain
area,
she
could
say
i
use
the
federal
land
adjacent
to
and
then
just
name
one
of
the
sites
in
this
150,000
acres
that...
that
has
been
opened
for
mining.
that's
all
she
had
to
say.
that...
that's
really
not
a
big
deal.
justice
scalia
no.
justice
scalia
the
difference
is
in
the
vicinity
of
150,000
acres.
justice
scalia
and
in
the
vicinity
of
or
adjacent
to
the
particular
acre
of
those
150,000
where
mining
claims
have
been
filed
or
that
have
been
opened
for
the
filing
of
mining
claims.
that's
the
difference.
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
do
these
show
that
miss
peterson
was
harmed?
i
don't
understand
what
they
show.
how
can
they
show
that
she
was
hanging
around
these
mining
claims?
justice
scalia
oh,
well
that's
not
controverted.
i
mean,
that
isn't
the
point.
the
point
is
whether
it
was
causing
harm
to
her,
whether
she
was
using
those
particular
areas.
