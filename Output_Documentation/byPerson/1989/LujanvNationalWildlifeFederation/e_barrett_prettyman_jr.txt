mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
to
reach
and
resolve
two
issues
before
it
ever
gets
to
the
peterson
affidavit.
the
first
one,
of
course,
is
the
five
supplemental
memoranda,
and
on
that
issue
we
have
very
respectfully
suggested
to
the
court
that
it
might
want
to
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted,
because
what's
going
on--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--no,
sir.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'm
indeed
familiar
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
suggest
to
you,
however,
that
this
kind
of
suggestion
is
the
same
as
jurisdiction.
that
is,
that
you
can
raise
it
at
any
time
yourself.
we're
not
making
a
motion
or
anything.
we're
just
suggesting
to
the
court
in
using
its
discretion
that
it
might
want
to
get
rid
of
this
case--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--in
this
fashion.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
the
point
was
made
about
the
five
supplemental
memoranda,
and
i'm
merely
suggesting
to
you
that
when
you...
when
you
hear
the
situation
that
you're
in
at
the
moment,
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
case
that
it's
not
worth
this
court's
time
to
hear,
because
what
you're
doing
is,
you're
passing
in
effect
on
the
discretion
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
rule
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
a
matter
of
local
practice.
now
what...
what...
these
five
supplemental
memoranda
arose
in
a
very
peculiar
context--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--affidavits.
they...
they
were.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
did
i
misstate?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
apologize.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
of
course
i
do--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--absolutely.
they
accompanied
the
memoranda
that
was
filed
a
month
after
the
hearing.
the
hearing
was
july
22nd,
1988.
up
until
this
time,
two
courts
for
three
years
had
told
us
that
we
had
standing.
so
we
come
to
this
hearing,
and
even
at
the
beginning
of
the
hearing
the
court
tells
the
government
lawyer
that
he's
probably
on
the
wrong
side
of
this
case.
we're
feeling
very
comfortable.
in
the
middle
of
the
hearing,
the
government
lawyer
gets
up
and
begins
reading
these
facts
about
rmps...
resource
management
plans...
and
about
how
they've
completed
all
of
these
plans.
we'd
alleged
in
our
complaint
that
they'd
only
completed
nine.
their
own
affidavit
had
said
they
had
completed
25,
and
all
of
a
sudden
here
he's
talking
about
they've
completed
50.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
exactly.
that's
the
williams
affidavit.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
the
williams
affidavit
was
filed...
september
5,
1986.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
july
22nd,
1988.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
'86.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
we
were
using
the
last
figures
that
they
submitted.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
and
all
of
a
sudden
they
arrive
at
the
hearing
and
they
begin
updating,
and
then
they
produce
this
piece
of
paper
which
they
say
back
up
these
new
figures.
now,
they
have
the
court...
the
district
court's
attention
now.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
if
we
are
correct
that
the
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
not
allowing
in
the
five
affidavits
and
the
government
has
just
told
you
that
at
least
looking
at
the
affidavits
they
would
concede
that
they
are
sufficient
to
establish
standing,
then
we
never
have
to
reach--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
i
will
move
to
the
peterson
affidavit.
i
just
want
to
make
sure
you
understand
that
you
don't
get
there
until
you
do
disagree
with
us
on
that
point.
now
here,
they
say
there's
a
violation
of
rule
56.
they
violated
rule
56.
they
turn
up
at
this
hearing,
give
the
district
court
judge
all
these
figures,
turn
in
a
piece
of
paper--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--what
i'm
saying
is
it
comes
with
little
grace
for
them
to
argue
that
we
did--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
it
may
be,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
because
we
thought
we
were
going
to
have
a
chance
to
respond
to
them
in
supplemental
affidavits.
now
this
is
a--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--he
had
told
us
that
we
could
file
supplemental
memoranda.
we
did
not
ask
for
supplemental
affidavits.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
correct.
we
were
totally
surprised
by
this
piece
of
paper.
at
the
very
end
of
the
hearing
the
judge
says
we'll
mark
it
as
an
exhibit,
and
then
suddenly
it's
an
exhibit
and
we're
confronted
with
it.
but
since
we
know
we're
going
to
be
able
to
respond
and
the
government
is
going
to
be
able
to
respond
to
us,
we
didn't
think
that
there
would
be
any
harm.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh,
your
honor,
but
it
had
very
much
to
do
with
rmps,
which
the
district
court--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
but
in
ruling
on
standing,
on
throwing
this
out,
the
district
court
ruled
on
the
merits
on
rmps.
if
you
look
at
his
opinion
and
you
look
at
page
35a
of
his
opinion
and
the
next
page,
you'll
find
that
he's
talking
about
the
fact
that
our
contention
about
the
fact
that
we
didn't
get
the
hearings
and
so
forth
were
all
rebutted
by
the
government's
evidence.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that's
exactly
one
of
my
points,
your
honor,
is
that
he
should
not
have
been
ruling
on
the
merits,
but
he
did.
it's
in
his
opinion.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
all
i
can
do
is
read
his
opinion,
and
his
opinion
passed
on
a
number
of
points
that...
that
would
appear
to
be
on
the
merits.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
but
your
honor,
if
he
sets
forth
right
here
in
the
opinion
as
part
of
his
reason
for
dismissing
on
standing
certain
facts
that
really
go
to
the
merits,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
are
entitled
to
say
he
should
never
have
done
that,
that
that's
part
of
the
problem
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.
i
think
what--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--no.
i
think
what
you
should
do
when
you
send
it
back
is
to
say
that
go
ahead
and
allow
the
defect
in
standing,
if
there
is
any,
to
be
cured
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
that
was
the
practice
in
the
district
of
columbia.
defects
in
the
district
of
columbia
can
be
cured
by
supplemental
affidavit.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
of
course,
it
does,
your
honor,
but
the
federal
rule
does
not
mean
that
you
have
to
file
it
at
the
hearing,
because
if
that
were
true
a
district
judge
could
not
even
have
given
us
permission
to
file
those
affidavits
afterwards,
and
that's--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--but
suppose
he
had
said
you
can
file
affidavits
with
your
memoranda?
under
the
government's
interpretation
that
would
be
a
violation
of
rule
56,
and
he
couldn't
have
done
it.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
that
isn't
what
the
lower
courts
have
said.
it
may
be
that's
what
this
court
is
going
to
say,
but
the
lower
courts
have
said
that
you
can...
that
you
can
cure
these
defects
and
particularly
in
the
district
of
columbia.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
status
of
the
case
before
you
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
ruled
that
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
of
the
district
court
under
all
of
the
circumstances
here.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
that
question
is
definitely
before
you,
and
you
have
to--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--and
consider
all
the
equities,
which
it
did.
absolutely.
now
the
other
thing
that
you're
going
to
have
to
face
and
resolve
before
you
reverse
is
the
problem
of
the
standing
of
the
federation
on
its
own.
that
is
a
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
never
had
to
reach
because
it--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--because
if
we
had
standing
on
our
own,
there
is
standing.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
agree
with
you
100
percent.
maybe
i...
maybe
didn't
make
myself
clear.
what
i
mean
was
that
you
should
remand.
the
case
isn't
over.
you
don't
order
it
dismissed
for
lack
of
standing.
you'd
have
to
remand
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
court
of
appeals
would
then
determine
whether
we
have
standing
on
our
own.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right.
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
all
right.
now
let's
get
to
the
peterson
affidavit,
finally.
first
of
all,
it's
not
2
million
acres.
the
2
million
acres
is
freemont
and
natrona
counties.
what
we're
talking
about
is
4,455
acres,
which
are
the
lands
that
were
open
to
mining.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
problems
here
is
that--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.
she
was
not
describing
some
greater
area.
she
was
describing
the
south
pass
and
green
mountain
areas,
and
if
you
look--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--exactly.
the
4,400
are
included
within
the
south
pass
and
green
mountain--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--it's
a
total
of
approximately
150,000.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
green
mountain
is
about
126,000,
and
the
rest--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
was
going
to
address
that
in
just
a
moment.
could
i
just
clear
up
this
one
thing?
you
will
see
a
figure
of
1.2
million
in
the
kelly
affidavit,
but,
believe
me,
that
includes
the
crook's
mountain
area,
and
it's
like
a
lot
of
the
government's
figures
in
this
case.
you
can
get
different
results.
the
best
we
can
figure
from
the
government's
own...
own
evidence
is
150,000
acres.
now,
all
right,
let
me
say
what
i
think
happened
here,
because
we're
not
just
looking
at
the
peterson
affidavit.
you're
looking
at
the
record
as
a
whole.
the
government's
evidence
is
most
important
here.
mrs.
peterson
swore
that
she
recreated
in
the
vicinity
of
south
pass
and
green
mountain,
where
the
lands
have
been
open
to
mining
and...
and
this
mining
threatens
the
aesthetics
and
the
wildlife,
which
in
turn
harms
her.
now
that's
essentially
what
she
said.
then
the
government
comes
along
and
shows
that,
indeed,
4,455
acres
were
open
to
mining
in
the
south
pass
and
green
mountain
areas,
and
that
has
resulted
in
406
mining
claims
being
filed
and
some
operations
being
started,
and
the
government
also
shows
that
the
mining
was
not
only...
not
only
can
but
will...
has
hurt
the
wildlife
and
aesthetics
in
these
very
same
areas.
i
mean,
i
can
read
to
you
here
where
the
government
both
in
'82
and
in
'85
and
'86
said
specifically,
for
example,
in
south
pass,
these
activities...
they're
talking
about
dredging
and
underground
tunnels
for
mining...
have
an
adverse
impact
on
crucial
moose
habitat,
deer
habitat,
some
elk
habitat
and
a
variety
of
small
game
species.
improvements
at
campgrounds,
as
well
as
land
in
the
immediate
vicinity
could
either
be
damaged
or
destroyed.
this
is
not
the
government
talking
about--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--they're
talking
about--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--what
they
are
talking
about,
your
honor,
is
the
mining
in
the
4,455
that's
in
south
pass
and
green
mountain.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
of
course
we
know
where
it
is.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
oh,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
but
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
i'm
sorry.
i
respectfully
disagree.
if
you
look
in
the
federal
register
you
can
tell
exactly
where
these
places
are
within
the
40...
within
the--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--no.
i'm
saying
that
the
government
is
talking
about
the
exact
area
that
she's
talking
about.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
government
is
talking
about
the
harm
that
will
come
to
aesthetics
and
wildlife
from
the
opening
of
the
mining
and
where
the
opening
of
the...
opening
to
mining
occurred
was
in
the
4,455
which
she
says
she's
in
the
vicinity
of.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
she
said--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--sure.
yes.
look
in
the
petition
appendix
at
page...
the
best
part
is
191a.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
of
the
petition
appendix.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
191a
and
let's
take,
for
example,
paragraph
6.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
right.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i'm
saying
that
the...
yes,
that
the
south
pass/green
mountain
area...
you
take
the
resource
areas
that
encompass
those.
that
would
be
something
on
the
order
of
150,000
acres.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
yes,
that's
right.
now,
let's
go
to
paragraph
6.
"my
recreational
use
and
aesthetic
enjoyment
of
federal
lands,
particularly
those
in
the
vicinity
of
south
pass/green
mountain,
wyoming,
have
been
and
continue
to
be
adversely
affected,
in
fact,
by
the
unlawful
actions.
"
--she's
now
talking
about
the
terminations...
"of
the
bureau
and
the
department.
"
"in
particular,
the
south
pass/green
mountain
area
of
wyoming
has
been
opened
to
the
staking
of
the
mining
claims
and
oil
and
gas
leasing,
an
action
which
threatens
the
aesthetic
beauty
and
wildlife
habitat
potential
of
those
lands.
"
now,
the
government's
evidence
comes
in
and
says
in
the
south
pass/green
mountain
areas
the
area
that
has
been
opened
to
mining
is
4,455
acres.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
of
course
not.
there
obviously
has
to
be
a
good
judgment
here,
and
it's
a
question--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that...
that
when
she
says
that
she
is
using
two
areas
that
the
government
concedes
were
open
to
mining
and
the
government
concedes
were
harmed...
have
been
harmed
by
the
mining
and
that's
precisely
what
she
says
that
she's
being
harmed
by
the
aesthetics
and
wildlife
that
that's
enough.
now,
obviously,
if
she
just
says
i'm
in
the
vicinity
of
arizona
or
i'm
in
the
vicinity
of
the
west
coast
or
i'm
in
the
vicinity
of
the
united
states,
it's
not
enough.
but
you
know,
it...
to
parse
this
down
so
that
she
has
to
set
forth
each
tract
like
you
do
in
the
federal
register...
you
can't
do
that
with
people
who
are
swearing
to
this.
they
don't
know...
they
don't
know
what
these
tracts
are.
what
she's
saying
is
that
i
go
up
there
in
this
area,
and
there's
the
mining,
and
it's
harming
me,
and
the
government
comes
in
and
says
well,
yeah,
we're
mining
there,
and
we'll
tell
you
exactly
where
it
is,
and
it
is
doing
some
harm,
but
you
don't
have
any
standing.
what
happened
to
scrap,
for
example,
where
the
people--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
nevertheless
you
said
that
it
was
sufficient
that
the
people
were
in
the
area
of
the...
wildlife
federation.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well,
what
about
japan
whaling,
your
honor,
that
justice
white
wrote,
where
you'll
recall
that
the...
the...
the...
they
said
just
because
the
conservation
group's
members
enjoyed
watching
whaling
and
studying
whaling
that
that
was
enough
to
give
them
standing
to
challenge
the
secretary
of
commerce's
refusal
to
condemn
japan
for
whaling.
i
mean,
that...
i
mean,
there
are
all
kinds
of
cases
from
this
court
where...
what
about...
what
about
the
brock
case,
for
example?
international
union
v.
brock.
there...
you
remember
those
were
the
benefits
given
to
union
members
to...
to...
to
help
them
against
import
competition.
and
the
secretary
of
labor
there
issues
a
policy
handbook,
and
the
union
comes
in...
not
all
members
of
the
union
were
affected,
and
not
all
those
affected
were
members
of
the
union,
but
the
union
comes
in
and
says
we
represent
these
people.
you
didn't
require
that
you
go
back
and
show
for
each
union
member
what
wage
and
what
pay
and
how
many
hours
he
worked
and
so
forth.
you
said
that
so
long
as
some
union
members
were
affected,
even
though
the
state
agencies
were
making
the
decision
in
that
case,
that
there
was
standing.
in
watt
v.
energy
foundation,
the...
you
remember
the
case
where
the
secretary
of
the
interior
was...
was
using
different
bidding
systems,
which
affected
everybody
differently.
all
the
parties
were
affected
differently.
and
you
said
that
there
was
standing
for
california
to
challenge
the
issue
of
the
regulations
and
tell
him
he
had
to
follow
the
act
even
though
everybody
was
affected
differently.
i
just
don't
understand
in
the
context
of
these
other
cases
why
this
case
is
any
different.
the...
mr.
roberts
says...
in
effect
i
think
what
he's
saying
is
that
a...
that
somebody
would
have
to
come
in
and
show...
all
of
our
members
would
have
to
come
in
and
show
for
each
tract,
for
each
little
area
throughout
the
united
states
that
they
were
harmed.
that's
not...
that
isn't
what
you
all
have
said.
in
sierra
club
v.
morton
you
said
so
long
as
one
person
can
establish
standing,
they
can
represent
the
public
interests,
represent
the--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
i
must
say
i
don't
see
the...
the
difference
between
"in
the
vicinity
of"
and
"adjacent
to".
i
mean,
in
vicinity
of
seems
to
me--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--it
means
around
and
about.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
it's
in
the
vicinity--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
it's...
it's
in
the
vicinity
of
the
4,455,
and...
and
to
say
that
she
has
to
do
it
tract
by
tract
is
different
than
anything
i've
ever
read
in
any
of
this
court's
opinions.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
well.
it's...
yes,
it's
50
miles.
it's
only...
it's
150
miles
from
her
house
to
green
mountain
and
then
it's
about
185...
a
little
bit
more
than
that
to
south
pass.
she
can
get
down
there
in
a
couple
of
hours.
that's
not
in
the
record,
but
i
mean
she
can
get
down
there
in
a
couple
of
hours.
i
mean,
you
all...
you
would
be
requiring
laymen
who
are
hunters
and
fishermen
to
swear
to
something
that
they
aren't
prepared
to
swear
to
when...
when
you're
going
to
require
them
to
name
these
particular
tracts
that
they
happen
to
have
been
on.
normally
when
you
fish
and
camp
and
hunt
you're
not
on
any
one
tract
anyway;
you're
around
a
whole
area.
and
if
she's
being
harmed
by
mining,
which
the
government
admits...
the
government
concedes
a
mining
is
causing
harm
to
aesthetics
and...
and
the
kinds
of
things
that
she
does,
you
can't
just
take
her
affidavit
alone.
you've
got
to
look
at
the
record
as
a
whole.
and
i
think...
the
court
of
appeals
never
had
to
do
that
because
it
said
the
peterson
affidavit
is
all
right.
but
if
you're
going
to
look
at
this
peterson
affidavit,
you
have
to
look
at
the...
at
the...
under
rule
56
you
have
to
look
at
the
record
as
a
whole.
and
the
record
as
a
whole,
when
you
throw
in
the
government's
evidence,
will
show
you
not
only
that
any
minor
lapses
that
she
left
out
are
filled
in,
but
also
that
what
she
claims
is
going
on
is
going
on.
the
government
says
it.
it
says
as
late
as--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--the
only
thing
that
i...
that
i
part
company
with
on
the
court
of
appeals
is
that
i
don't
think
they
had
to
rely
on
any
presumption
because
they--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--they
did
because
they
didn't
look
at
the
government's
evidence.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
i
don't
concede
that
they're
in
error.
all
i'm
saying
is
they
didn't
have
to
say
presumption.
they
could
easily--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--if
the
record
as
it
stands
before
this
court
fully
supports
mrs.
peterson
in
every
respect,
where
she
recreated,
what
she
saw,
the
harm
that
was
done--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
then
send
it
back
to
them
and
let
them
do
it,
because
that's
what
they
were
supposed
to
do
under
rule
56,
and
that's
what
this
court
said
in--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--only
in
that
one
instance,
that
they
didn't...
they
didn't--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--they
didn't...
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
they...
they
simply
took
an
easy
shortcut
when
i
would
have
said
to
them
look,
look
at
the
whole
record
the
way
you're
supposed
to
and
you
won't
even
have
to
deal
with
any
presumptions.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
didn't
argue
it
in
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
i
must
tell
you
in
all
candor,
i
don't
know
how
it
was
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals.
well,
in...
in
terms
of
this
so-called
presumption,
i
mean
i
am
happy
to
try
to
uphold
the
court
of
appeals
on
a
presumption.
all
i'm
saying
is
i
don't
think
they
had
to
do
it.
but
if...
so
far
as
they
did
do
it,
i
mean
if
you
look
at
gladstone
realtors,
for
example...
and
that,
incidentally,
was
not
a
motion
to
dismiss,
that
was
a
summary
judgment
case...
and
the
court
said
that
the
complaints
were
conclusory
in
that
case,
but
we're
going
to
construe
them
favorably
to
the
village
of
elwood
in
that
case,
just
as
i
think
you
should
do
here,
because
after
all
the
other
side
is
the
moving
party,
not
us.
we're
the
nonmoving
party,
and
therefore
this...
these
affidavits--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--in
terms
of
the
harm,
i
would
refer
you
to
defendant
intervenor's
exhibits
7...
exhibit
b
of
that
exhibit...
which
has
a
whole
lot
of
things
in
it.
it's
not...
it
wasn't
very
well
put
together,
but
it
includes
the
mineral
report--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--yes.
that's
what
i'm
referring
to.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
it
includes
a
mineral
report
and
a
geologist's
report
and
so
forth.
those...
and
in
addition
to
that
i'd
refer
you
to
exhibit
12
to
the
kelly
exhibit.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
no,
it
doesn't,
your
honor.
what
i've
just
referred
to
shows
that
in
the
south
pass/green
mountain
area
there
is
mining
going
on
and
there's...
causing
it
harm.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
look
at
joint
appendix
119,
your
honor,
if
i
may
ask
you
to.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
now,
you
see
the
w
6228?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
action
number
w
6228.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
the
areas
opened,
4,455,
that
is
south
pass/green
mountain.
claims
located
after
opening,
406
claims
have
been
after...
opened
after...
after
they
opened
it
up,
406
mining
claims
were
opened
up,
and
that's
only
in
the
period
between
the...
prior
to
the
injunction.
so
i
mean
a
lot
of
claims
came
in--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
the
government
evidence
shows
that
throughout
the--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--throughout
the
united
states.
i
don't
understand
your
point,
your
honor.
this...
this
and
other
evidence
shows,
if
i
may
just
make
myself
clear,
that
the
south
pass/green
mountain
area,
the
4,455,
the
very
area
that
she
says
she
recreated
in,
were
in
fact
opened
to
mining.
and
the
other
evidence
i
have
just
cited
shows
that
that
area
was
not
only
opened
to
mining
but
adversely
affected
by
mining,
which
is
precisely
what
she
claims,
so
you
put
together
these
various
tidbits
from
the
government's
evidence,
which
you
have
to
do
under
rule
56,
and
it's
clear,
she
recreated
there,
that
mining
was
there--
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
--well,
she
says
"in
the
vicinity".
in
mean,
do
you...
do
you...
does
she
have
to
say
that
she
walked
right
on
a
particular...
over
a
mine?
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
correct.
mr.
e.
barrett
prettyman,
jr.
she
sure
did.
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
