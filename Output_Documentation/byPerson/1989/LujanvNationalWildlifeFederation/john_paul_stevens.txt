justice
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
for
a
second?
it
seems
to
me
that
argument
goes
to
the
merits,
the
31...
i
mean,
maybe
she
has
no
right
in
montana,
but
if
she
has
a
right
even
as
to
4,500
acres
we
don't
throw
her
case
entirely
out
of
court,
do
we?
justice
stevens
or
if
there's
some
other
record
basis
for
standing.
justice
stevens
then...
then
you
lose
on
the
only
issue
that's
before
us
here.
the
fact
that
there
are
millions
and
millions
of
other
acres
out
there
somewhere
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
have
anything
to
do
with
the
standing
issue,
does
it?
justice
stevens
but
if
it
gets...
your...
your
position
doesn't
get
her
one
inch
into
the
180
million
acres.
justice
stevens
well,
then
why
do
we
have
to
talk
about
anything
but
that
one
inch?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
and
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
any
one
of
those
three
theories,
then
we
reverse...
we
affirm?
justice
stevens
and
we
have
to
sort
through
all
of
them
and
decide
which
ones--
justice
stevens
--that's
the
difference
between
being
a
trial
judge
and
sitting
here.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
would
you
just
help
me
out...
get
one
fact
straight
in
my
mind
again?
these
were
filed
in
the
briefs
after
the
hearing?
is
that
when
they
were
filed?
justice
stevens
it
added
these
affidavits?
justice
stevens
what
if
the
respondent
had
submitted
these
affidavits
at
the
oral
hearing?
justice
stevens
if
they'd
come
in
a
week
before
the
hearing,
they
would
have
been
timely?
justice
stevens
i
had
the
impression
they
were
several
years
late,
but
really
they
were
only
about
six
or
eight
weeks
late.
justice
stevens
during
which
time
they
apparently
thought
it
wasn't
necessary,
because
they'd
been
winning
on
standing
up
to
that
point.
justice
stevens
when
they
realized
they
were
in
trouble.
justice
stevens
let
me
ask...
maybe
this
is
a
stupid
question,
but
if
there's
no
standing
and
you
throw
the
whole
case
out
as
of
now,
is
that
with
prejudice
or
without
prejudice?
can
they
come
back
and
file
a
new
complaint
with
these
new
affidavits
supporting
standing?
justice
stevens
what
would
they
be
estopped
for?
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
that
first
case.
justice
stevens
what
if
the
individual
affiants
were
to
file
a
case?
justice
stevens
the
thing
that's
running
through
my
mind,
if
we
take
a
look
at
these
other
affidavits...
i
know
you
say
we
shouldn't
look
at
them...
and
we
should
conclude...
say,
we
should
conclude
that
it's
perfectly
clear
these
people
have
standing,
are
we
perhaps
generating
a
new
series
of
lawsuits
by
saying
well,
we'll
throw
this
case
out
and
let
these
other
people
start
all
over
again,
as
class
action
or
some...
with
a
different...
not
the
national
wildlife
federation,
but--
justice
stevens
--i
assume
you
are
being
logical
and
saying
that
standing
is
res
judicata
only
as
to
this
particular
order
of
the
agency,
and
not
nationwide?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question?
can
we
tell
by
looking
at
the
record
if
we
find
all
the
right
pieces
of
paper
where
the
4,455
areas
are?
justice
stevens
so
you
agree
we
can
look
at
the
material
your
opponent
described?
