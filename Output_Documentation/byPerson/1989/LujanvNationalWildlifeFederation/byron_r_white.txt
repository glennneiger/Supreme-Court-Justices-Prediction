justice
white
well,
suppose
we
disagree
with
you
and
think
that
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion.
do
you...
you
don't
suggest
that
those
additional
affidavits
were
insufficient
to
establish
standing?
justice
white
well,
so
you...
you
don't
say
that
on
their
face
they
were
deficient?
justice
white
so...
but
you
would
say
that,
nevertheless,
if...
even
if
they
are
sufficient
they
relate
only
to
the
specific
area
that
they
mention?
justice
white
and
so
if
they
did,
you
did,
too.
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
it
may.
it
may.
but
if
they
did,
you
did,
too.
justice
white
well,
are
you
defending
the
court
of
appeals'
rationale
in
finding
standing
or
not?
justice
white
but
they
did.
justice
white
well,
they
did,
though,
so...
so
they...
on
that
basis
you're
saying
you
concede
that
they
were
in
error--
justice
white
--that
they
applied
the
wrong
rule
of
law
in
deciding
standing.
justice
white
well,
they
did
and
relied
on
it.
justice
white
well,
why
should
we
have
to
do
all
that?
if
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in...
in...
in
arriving
at
its
conclusion,
why
shouldn't
they
have
to
do
the
job
that
you
are
now
suggesting
we
should
do?
justice
white
so
you
do
part
company
with
the
court
of
appeals
in
that?
justice
white
well,
that's
a
pretty
big
instance,
isn't
it?
justice
white
how
did
you
argue
it
in
the
court
of
appeals?
like
you're
doing
now?
justice
white
well,
how
did...
how
was
the
case
argued
in
the
court
of
appeals,
like
you're
doing
it
now?
justice
white
you
don't
really
contend
that
she
must
have
alleged
that
she
used
the
4,500
acres
in
order
to
establish
standing?
justice
white
just
answer
my
question.
you
do
not
say
that?
justice
white
well,
if...
you
know,
if
there's
a
mining
going
on
in
4,500
acres
and
in
order
to
mine
there
are
a
lot
of...
they
have
to
build
some
more
roads,
there's
a
lot
of
trucks
going
back
and
forth
all
the
time,
it
can
certainly
affect
a
very
wide
area.
justice
white
well,
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
well,
that
makes
it
even
tougher
for
you,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
well,
they
could
be
scattered
all
over
that
150,000
acres,
and
trucks
going
back
and
forth
to
every
one.
justice
white
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
white
is
there
a
map
in
these
papers,
or
not?
justice
white
well,
can
we
tell
there's...
can
we
get
the
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
looking
at
these
maps?
justice
white
well,
we
can
certainly
read.
[laughter]
justice
white
does
it
tell
you...
does
it
tell
you...
can
we
plot
it
out
on
a
map
from
what
it
says?
