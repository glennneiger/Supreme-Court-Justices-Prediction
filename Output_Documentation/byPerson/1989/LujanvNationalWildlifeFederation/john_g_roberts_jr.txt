mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
that
court
held
that
respondent
had
standing
to
challenge
hundreds
of
bureau
of
land
management
land
orders
entered
over
the
course
of
several
years
affecting
180
million
acres
of
public
lands
in
17
states.
the
court
concluded
that
a
single
affidavit
of
one
of
respondent's
members,
peggy
kay
peterson,
was
sufficient
to
confer
that
standing.
in
her
affidavit
ms.
peterson
claimed
that
she
used
federal
lands
in
the
vicinity
of
the
south
pass/green
mountain
area
of
wyoming,
and
she
claimed
that
she
was
injured
by
a
blm
decision
to
open
that
area
to
the
staking
of
mining
claims.
the
district
court
found
that
the
area
in
question
covered
some
2
million
acres,
of
which
only
6,000
acres
had
ever
been
closed
to
mining,
and
of
those
6,000
the
blm
decision
only
opened
4,500
to
the
staking
of
mining
claims.
the
court
noted
that
peterson's
affidavit
said
nothing
about
using
the
4,500
affected
acres
and,
therefore,
concluded
that
she
had
shown
no
injury
and
that
respondent,
therefore,
had
no
standing.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
claim
was
in
the
greenwalt
declaration,
one
of
the
other
of
the
three
original
affidavits
that
were
submitted
by
respondent.
the
claim
there
was
that
the
organization
had
standing
in
its
own
right,
without
regard
to
any
injury
to
its
particular
members.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
the
district
court,
we
believe,
correctly
concluded
that
that
declaration,
the
greenwalt
declaration,
was
completely
conclusory
and
devoid
of
specific
facts.
but
more
important,
it's
really
just
sierra
club
against
morton
all
over
again.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
with
respect,
your
honor,
no,
it
did
not
reach
the
greenwalt
declaration.
it
didn't
pass
on
that,
choosing
to
rest
its
decision
entirely
on
the
peterson
affidavit.
the
district
court,
however,
did
address
the
greenwalt
declaration
and
found
it,
as
i've
indicated,
conclusory
and
devoid
of
fact.
it
is,
as
i've
mentioned,
the
sierra
club
case
all
over
again.
in
fact,
it's...
it's
helpful
to
compare
the
allegation
of
standing
in
the
sierra
club
case
with
that
in
the
greenwalt
declaration.
they're
really
quite
similar.
each
of
them
says
our
organization
has
experience
and
expertise
in
conservation.
we're
vitally
interested
in
this
issue.
in
the
sierra
club
case
the
affidavit
said
we
responsibly
serve
and
represent
our
members.
in
the
greenwalt
declaration,
ms.
greenwalt
claimed
that
the
organization
needed
information
and
public
participation
in
order
to
represent
their
members.
but
this
court
in
the
morton
case
said
that
that
sort
of
interest
was
insufficient
to
confer
standing
because
it
was
in
no
way
distinct
from
the
interest
any
citizen
could
claim
coming
in
the
courthouse
and
saying
i'm
interested
in
this
subject.
turning
back
to
the
peterson
affidavit,
what
ms.
peterson
claimed
was
that
she
used
land
in
the
vicinity
of
this
2
million
acre
parcel,
the
south
pass/green
mountain
area
of
wyoming.
the
district...
the
d.c.
circuit
on
appeal
presumed
that
she
meant
to
say
something
else.
it
presumed
that
she
meant
to
say
she
used
the
4,500
affected
acres.
the
reasoning
was
that
she
claimed
that
she
was
injured,
claimed
that
she
had
standing,
and
she
would
only
be
injured
and
only
have
standing
if
she
used
the
4,500
acres
and,
therefore,
she
must
have
meant
to
say
that
she
used
those
4,500
acres.
this
is
exactly
backwards.
federal
courts
are
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction.
the
presumption
is
that
they
are
without
jurisdiction,
and
the
plaintiff
must
affirmatively
prove
that
he
has
standing
to
invoke
the
power
of
the
court.
the
court
of
appeals
presumed
peterson
meant
to
say
she
used
the
4,500
acres
because
otherwise
she
wouldn't
have
standing.
but
what
peterson
said
is
that
she
was
in
the
vicinity
of
this
2
million
acre
area,
not
even
within
the
2
million
acres,
just
in
the
vicinity.
even
assuming
we
can
place
peterson
somewhere
within
the
2
million
acres,
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
basis
for
drastically
narrowing
the
focus
of
her
allegations
on
the
0.225
percent
of
that
area
that
was
the
only
area
affected
by
the
challenged
decision.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
it's
an
area
that's
familiar
to
people
in
central
western
wyoming.
that's
what
the
area
is.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
it
is
the
term
that
the...
the
bureau
used
in
the
land
use
planning
process.
i
refer
the
court
to
page
132
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
affidavit
of
jack
kelly,
who's
the
administrator
of
the
area,
in
which
he
refers
to
the
south
pass/green
mountain
area
as
consisting
of
these...
these
2
million
acres.
by
any
token,
it
is
a
vast
expanse.
south
pass
is
some
55
miles
from
green
mountain.
so,
even
taking
the
allegation
as
narrowly
as
possible
on
its
face,
what
she's
referring
to
is
essentially
the
equivalent
of
being
in
the
vicinity
of
the
baltimore-washington
area.
and
it's
important
to
remember
that
there's
never
been
any
mystery
about
where
these
4,500
acres
are.
this
isn't
a
case
where
she
alleged
a
vast
area
because
she
didn't
know
where
the
government
was
affecting
the
lands.
two
years
before
her
affidavit
was
filed
the
bureau
published
in
the
federal
register
a
very
exact
designation
of
the
parcels
comprising
the
4,500
acres.
respondent
knew
this.
it
cited
the
federal
register
notice
in
its
complaint.
therefore,
if
we're
going
to
indulge
in
presumptions,
the
more
reasonable
presumption
would
be
that
if
peterson
or
any
other
of
respondent's
members
could
have
alleged
that
they
used
those
particular
4,500
acres,
they
would
have.
but
neither
peterson
nor
anyone
else
did.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
compounded
its
error
many
times
over
when
it
ruled
that
the
peterson
affidavit
conferred
standing
on
respondent
to
challenge
not
only
the
south
pass/green
mountain
order,
but
hundreds
of
other
blm
orders
affecting
another
178
million
acres
of
public
lands
throughout
the
west...
this,
despite
the
fact
that
the
peterson
affidavit
said
nothing
beyond
the
confines
of
south
pass
and
green
mountain.
respondent's
argument
on
this
score
is
that
it's
complaining
about
a
program,
that
blm
has
a
program
to
review
land
classifications
and
land
withdrawals.
in
a
certain
sense
this
is
true.
such
review
is
a
very
big
part
of
what
the
bureau
of
land
management
does.
but
saying
they
have
a
program
to
review
land
use
classifications
is
like
saying
that
nasa
has
a
program
to
explore
space
or
the
department
of
justice
has
a
program
to
prosecute
criminals.
of
course
they
do.
that's
what
the
agency
does.
but
it's
beside
the
point
so
far
as
standing
is
concerned.
the
respondent
relies
for
its
standing
on
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
that
provision
gives
a
right
to
judicial
review
to
a
person
who
is
aggrieved
by
final
agency
action.
the
respondent
cannot
be
aggrieved
by
the
sort
of
program
it
complains
about.
it
may
not
like
the
way
the
blm
is
going
about
its
business.
it
may
even
think
that
the
blm
is
violating
the
law
in
the
way
it
goes
about
its
business.
but
until
that
program
or
policy
culminates
in
a
final
agency
action,
respondent
is
not
aggrieved.
the
final
agency
actions
in
this
case
are
the
land
orders.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
question
of
standing
focuses
on
whether
this
particular
plaintiff
can
raise
the
particular
claims
in
the
complaint.
so
it's
very
important
to
focus
on
what
they're
complaining
about.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
is
one
of
their
claims,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
your
honor,
the
failure
to
prepare
an
environmental
impact
statement
is
not
final
agency
action.
the
way
that
that
can
be
challenged
is
when
the
final
agency
action...
in
this
case
a
land
order...
is
taken,
you
can
then
go
into
court
and
say
i'm
affected
by
what
the
agency
did,
its
final
action.
and
the
wrong
is
that
they
took
that
action
without
preparing
an
environmental
impact
statement.
they
weren't
fully
informed
as
they
would
be
if
they
had
done
that.
but
it
still
must
wait
for
the
final
agency
action,
and
the
fact
that
there
is
a...
a
program
or
policy,
which
is
really
just
saying
this
is
the
way
the
agency
goes
about
its
work,
is
not
enough
to
confer
standing.
you
need
the
concrete
agency
action.
and
in
this
case
it
was
the
hundreds
of
land
orders
entered
throughout
the
west.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly
true,
your
honor,
but
the
key
is
the
second
predicate
to
your
question.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
if
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
had
jurisdiction
nationwide
over
all
of
these
land
orders.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
absolutely,
and
that's...
that's
not
an
unusual
result.
it's
no
different
than
the
situation
that
applies,
for
example,
when
in
a
particular
case
one
district
court
declares
an
act
of
congress
unconstitutional.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
act
cannot
be
enforced
against
other
people
in
other
districts,
and
obviously
the
government
tries
as
quickly
as
possible
to
get
the
case
to
this
court
which
has
nationwide
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
issue,
but
the
act
is
not
unconstitutional
across
the
board.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
can
say
it,
but
it
doesn't
apply
to
all
cases.
it
only
applies
to
the
cases
of
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
jurisdiction;
and,
to
the
extent
the
court
of
appeals
writes
a
persuasive
opinion,
the
reasoning
of
that
court
will
presumably
sway
other
courts
when
they
are
confronted
with
the
particular
plaintiff
suffering
particular
injury
from
a
particular
order.
now,
these
principles
are
particularly
important
in
this
case
because
these
land
orders
are
not
all
of
one
cloth.
they're
very
different.
to
cite
just
one
example,
31
of
the
challenged
land
orders
govern
some
5
million
acres
of
land
in
montana.
there
were
classifications
that
protected
that
land
against
entry
under
the
homestead
act.
you
couldn't
go
in
there
and
set
up...
your...
your
homestead.
in
1976,
however,
congress
in
the
federal
land
policy
management
act
repealed
the
homestead
act,
so
these
31
classifications
were
essentially
moot.
they
protected
against
a
threat
that
no
longer
existed.
they
couldn't...
and
terminating
those
classifications,
as
the
blm
did,
couldn't
possibly
aggrieve
anyone.
it
was
a
paper
transaction.
and
yet,
the
respondent
was
given
standing
to
challenge
those
31
orders
based
on
the
peterson
affidavit,
which
of
course
had
nothing
to
do
with
montana
at
all.
respondents'
theory
on
this
point
seems
to
be
that
they
can
bring
within
to
one
lawsuit
all
the
agency
actions
that
they
think
are
vulnerable
to
the
same
legal
theory
on
which
they
hope
to
prevail
in
the
action
before
the
court,
but
that
has
never
been
recognized
as
sufficient
to
confer
standing--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--oh,
no,
your
honor.
i
wouldn't...
if
the
court
disagrees
with
us
and
agrees
with
the
court
of
appeals'
presumption
approach
to
standing
that
peterson
has
standing--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--or
any
other
record
basis.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
the
question
is
how
far
peterson's
standing
gets
the
national
wildlife
federation.
they
have
standing
to
challenge--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
right.
i
don't
think
she--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
if...
if...
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
peterson
has
no
standing--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
the
court
agrees
with
us
further
that
the
supplemental
affidavits
were
properly
excluded
and
the
greenwalt
declaration
that
was
discussed
earlier
also
doesn't
establish
standing,
then
you
are
correct.
there's
no
reason
to
reach
whether
that--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
not,
your
honor.
the
court
of
appeals
gave
the
federation
standing
for
the
hundreds
of
other
land
orders
affecting
all
178
million
additional
acres.
if
you
disagree
with
us
as
to
peterson
or
any
of
the
others,
the
federation
has
shown
standing
for
those
limited
orders,
those
limited
parcels.
the
question
then
has
to
be
addressed
does
that
limited
standing
confer
standing
for
the
hundreds
of
other
orders
affecting
the
hundred--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that's
certainly
what
the
trial
court
would
have
to
do
if
the
case
were
sent
back
on
that
basis.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
understanding
doctrine,
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
that
he
has
been
injured
by
each
agency
action
as
to
which
he
seeks
relief.
the
federation
seeks
relief,
for
example,
for
those
31
land
orders
i
discussed
in
montana,
but
they've
not
even
attempted
to
show
that
they've
been
injured
by
those,
and
as
i've
indicated,
i
don't
think
anyone
could
be
injured
by
those
land
orders.
as
the
court
noted
in
allen
against
wright,
the
standing
focuses
on
whether
the
particular
plaintiff
can
raise
the
particular
claims
asserted.
the
particular
claim
that's
asserted
in
this
case
covers
the
hundreds
of
land
orders
throughout
the
west,
and
yet
this
particular
plaintiff
has
shown,
we
think,
standing
as
to
none
but,
at
most,
standing
as
to
the
particular
injury
claimed
in
the
affidavits.
now
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
this
regard
giving
the
federation
nationwide
standing
based
on
one
injury
to
a
particular
plaintiff
under
one
land
order
raises
the
most
serious
separation
of
powers
concerns
because
it
aggregates
in
the
district
court
all
of
the
bureau
of
land
management
orders
since
1981,
even
though
before
that
district
court
is
one
plaintiff
complaining
of
one
order.
those
types
of
separation
of
powers
concerns
are
precisely
what
the
standing
doctrine
is
designed
to
avoid.
turning
briefly
to
the
question
of
the
supplemental
affidavits,
i'd
first
point
out
as
i
mentioned
in
response
to
justice
stevens
that
those
would
certainly
not
end
the
case
even
if
they
were...
should
have
been
admitted
because
they
go,
again,
only
to
particular
plaintiffs'
particular
land
orders.
if
the
court
disagrees
with
us
on
those
and
if,
in
fact,
the
supplemental
affidavits
establish
standing,
it
would
only
be
to
the
limited
parcels,
the
limited
orders
mentioned
in
those
affidavits.
now,
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
declining
to
admit
these
affidavits
more
than
one
month
after
the
deadline
set
in
federal
rule
of
civil
procedure
56(c)
and
in
violation
of
the
court
order.
respondent
chose
as
a
deliberate
trial
tactic
over
the
course
of
several
years
to
rest
on
its
initial
three
affidavits
and
to
resist
at
every
turn
any
further
development
of
the
factual
record
on
standing.
the
district
court
was
on
the
scene
and
aware
of
all
the
circumstances
and
properly
exercised
its
discretion
in
refusing
to
reopen
the
factual
record
after
the
summary
judgment
hearing.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
it
had
our
motion
on
summary
judgment
specifically
directed
to
standing.
now,
it
may
have
been
overconfident
as
to
its
standing,
but
our
motion
certainly
put
it
on
notice
that
we,
at
least,
didn't
think
the
issue
was
dead.
and
in
addition,
the
first
court
of
appeals
opinion
addressed
the
issue
of
standing
in
the
context
of
a
motion
to
dismiss.
as
this
court
noted
in
the
scrap
decision,
the
standards
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
summary
judgment,
this
case,
are
very
different,
so
they
shouldn't
have
been
lulled
into
overconfidence
on
the
basis
of
the
prior
panel
decision.
furthermore,
the
district
court
had
not
seen
these
affidavits
when
it
wrote
its
preliminary
injunction
decision.
this
was
the
district
court's
first
opportunity
to
rule
on
standing
with
the
affidavits
before
it.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
don't
know,
your
honor,
because
we've
never
had
an
opportunity
to
take
discovery
on
them.
for
example,
they
claim
that
certain
areas
are...
have
been
open
to
mining.
if
we
had
an
opportunity--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--not
on
their
face,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
absolutely.
and
they
cannot
give
standing
nationwide
any
more
than
the
peterson
affidavit
can.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
government...
in
may
of
'86
they
filed
these
three
original
affidavits,
and
the
government
said,
well,
peterson
says
vicinity
2
million
acres,
let's
find
out
what
she's
talking
about,
let's
take
her
deposition.
the
respondent
resisted
that.
it
said
that
it
would
be
cumulative
and
burdensome.
and
it's
difficult
to
understand
how
they
can
prevent
the
government
from
developing
further
facts
on
standing
and
then
come
along
later
on
and
claim
a
right
of
their
own
for
additional
facts
after
the
hearing
is
over.
in
addition--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we...
if...
i'm
not
quite
certain,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
we
objected
to
the
submission
of
them
in
our
reply.
they
were
attached
to
a
legal
memorandum
that
the
respondent
submitted.
my
recollection
is
that
we
objected
to
them,
but
i'm
not
certain
of
that.
i
noted
that
the
district
court
in
ruling
that
the
affidavits
were
untimely
and
in
violation
of
its
order
cited
the
federal
parties'
reply
brief,
and
i
believe
that's
where
we
did
object
to
the
supplemental
affidavits.
when
we
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
standing,
that
was
the
opportunity
for
the
respondent,
if
it
wanted
to
submit
additional
facts,
to
do
so.
that's
the
standard
practice.
the
party
moves
for
summary
judgment,
submits
its
affidavits.
the
opposing
party
under
rule
56
is
entitled
to
submit
opposing
affidavits
prior
to
the
date
of
the
hearing.
respondent
deliberately
chose
not
to
do
that.
it
chose
to
rest
on
its
original
three
affidavits,
and
in
its
opposition
papers
it
claimed
that
those
affidavits
were
"far
more
than
is
necessary"
to
establish
its
standing.
it
was
only
at
the
hearing
when
it
became
evident
that
respondent's
standing
was
in
serious
doubt
that
the
respondent
changed
its
tune,
and
something
on
the
order
of
a
month
later
submitted
these
supplemental
factual
affidavits,
as
the
district
court
found,
in
violation
of
rule
56(c)
and
in
violation
of
the
court's
order
which
requested
additional
memoranda.
now,
the
respondent
has
cited
no
case,
and
we
are
aware
of
none,
in
which
a
court
of
appeals
has
held
that
a
district
court
abused
its
discretion
in
excluding
affidavits
that
it
found
to
be
untimely
and
in
violation
of
the
court
order.
and
for
the
reasons
i've
mentioned
this
would
be
a
very
curious
case
to
be
the
first
one.
respondent
had
several
years
to
further
develop
its
standing
allegations.
for
reasons
of
its
own
it
chose
not
to,
and
it
can't
be
given...
i
wouldn't
call
it
a
second
chance...
a
third
or
a
fourth
chance,
after
the
hearing
was
over.
if
this
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
by
the
trial
court,
it's
hard
to
imagine
when
a
trial
court
has
discretion
to
call
an
end
to
the
development
of
the
factual
record.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
at
the
hearing,
the
court,
although
it
had
no
obligation
to
do
so,
gave
the
respondents
another
chance
to
submit
legal
arguments.
he
said,
i
want
supplemental
memoranda
addressed
to
the
issue
of
standing.
when
the
respondent
filed
its
supplemental
memorandum--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
added
these
affidavits.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
also
would
have
been
too
late.
the
district
court
perhaps
had
discretion
to
continue
the
hearing
if
it
wished,
but
under
rule
56(c)
the
affidavits
were
due
prior
to
the
date
of
the
hearing.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
would
be
no
problem
if
they
had
come
in
the
day
before
the
hearing,
putting
aside
questions--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
they
had
the
opportunity,
in
responding
to
our
summary
judgment
motion.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right.
they
could
have
supplemented
the
record
any
time
along...
several...
two
years,
in
essence,
but
they
waited
until
a
month
after
the
hearing.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
when
they
realized
they
were
in
trouble,
and
the
principle
that
the
court
of
appeals
endorsed
and
which
respondents
argue
for
here
is
just
that,
the
principle
that
you
can
come
forward
with
additional
facts
whenever
you
think
you're
in
trouble.
it's
a
recipe,
as
we
say
in
our
reply
brief,
for
interminable
litigation.
presumably
it--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
there
would
be
a
serious
question
of
whether
they're
estopped
res
judicata.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
there
was
a
determination
as
to
their
standing,
and
i
don't
think
they
get
a
second
chance
to
come
in
and
try
again
after
a
determination
on
the
merits
of
the
standing
question.
now,
if
the
issue
is
complicated,
and
i...
and
i
just
add--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
would
be
an
entirely
new
case,
and
the...
and
the...
except
perhaps
maybe
not
with
respect
to
peterson.
i...
to
be
honest,
i
don't
think
the
law
is
developed
on
how
you
treat
organizational
standing
and
collateral
estoppel
in
that
situation.
is
peterson
estopped
because
her
injury
was
the
basis
for
the
organization's
standing?
it
certainly--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
certainly
a
different
organization
could
come
in
with
different
complaints
and
we'd
have
to
deal
with
that
in
that
situation.
but
your
objection
is...
is
one
that
could
be
made
in
almost
any
standing
case...
certainly
could
have
been
made
in
the
sierra
club
against
morton
case.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
serious
doubt
in
that
case
that
members
of
the
sierra
club
actually
used
mineral
king,
but
they
chose
not
to
make
that
allegation.
the
fact
that
another
lawsuit
could
be
brought
at
another
time
by
another
party
on
different
allegations
is
no
excuse
to
circumvent
the
standing
requirements,
which
focus
on
the
particular
case
before
the
court.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
to
be
consistent,
we'd
have
to
agree
with
that,
yes.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
just
a
few
brief
points,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
she
has
to
get
a
lot
closer
to
the
4,500
acres--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
she
could
well
have
standing
if
she
said
she
camped
next
to
one
of
the
parcels
that
was
opened.
that
i'd
be
willing
to
concede.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
court--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--mining
can
affect
a
very
large
area,
but
a
number
of
points:
the
4,500
is
not
one
parcel.
it's
several
discrete
parcels,
many
of
which
are
quite
small,
so
you
wouldn't
have--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
i
think
not,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
your
honor's
assuming
we're
talking
about
some
large
mining
operation.
typically
what's
involved
here,
given
the
size
of
the
parcels,
very
small
and
in
many
cases
what
you
call
recreational
miners--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we
know
it
from
the
size
of
the
parcels,
in
the
first
place.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they're
scattered
well
beyond
the
150,
your
honor.
they
are
clustered--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it's
in
the
2
million
acre
area.
they...
they're
not
dispersed
evenly.
there
are
vast
expanses
of
the
2
million
acre
area
that
miss
peterson
can
use.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
know
where
the
number
comes
from.
the
district
court
read
south
pass/green
mountain
area
to
be
2
million
acres,
and
the
court
of
appeals
also
looked
at
it
that
way.
that
was
one
of
the
things
they
got
right.
the
affidavits
establish
that
we're
talking
about
a
2
million
acre
area.
and
it's
interesting,
the
150,000
doesn't
work.
it
doesn't
work
because
if
you're
talking
just
about
green
mountain
and
south
pass,
that's
not
where
all
the
4,455
are.
some
of
them
are
elsewhere
in
the
area.
i'd
like
to
mention
briefly...
oh,
and
in
addition--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--absolutely,
and
in
the
federal
register
it's...
it's
listed--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
agree
you
can
look
at
the
federal
register
and
see
there--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there
are
a
variety
of
maps
in...
in--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--you
have
to
know
how
to
read
the
federal
register
notice.
it's
done
by
the
township
and--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
couldn't
until
i
was
told--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--absolutely.
absolutely,
and
there's
no
doubt
about
it.
the
federal
register
will
give
you
those
exact
coordinates.
my
brother
referred
you
to
joint
appendix
page
119,
to
classification
w
6228.
classification
w
6228
covers
more
than
2
million
acres.
it's
the
south
pass/green
mountain
area.
with
respect
to
the
supplemental
affidavits,
the
government
lawyer
at
the
hearing
responded
to
correct
reliance
on
some
stale
data
in
noting
how
far
they'd
gotten
in
the
rmp
process.
the
court
told
us
to
mark
it
as
an
exhibit.
we
did
so.
it
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
standing.
you
can
read
the
supplemental
affidavits
from
the
beginning
to
end.
you'll
see
no
mention
of
the
rmp
exhibit
that
the
court
added
to
the
record
to
make
sure
it
was
not
relying
on
stale
data.
the
was
some
discussion
earlier
about
sending
it
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
look
through
the
record
to
see
if
peterson
had
standing.
that's
not
a
court's
job.
that's
the
plaintiff's
job.
they
have
the
obligation
to
affirmatively
establish
their
standing.
they
failed
to
do
so
in
this
case.
thank
you,
your
honor.
