did
the...
did
the
court
sua
sponte
reject
the
supplemental
affidavits,
or
did
you
interpose
an
objection?
justice
kennedy
did
you
advise
the
court
at
the
time
of
the
hearing
that
you
wished
to
file
supplemental
affidavits?
justice
kennedy
and
so
you
did
not
advise
the
court
at
the
time
of
hearing
that
there
would
be
new
factual
matters?
justice
kennedy
what
is
the
government's
evidence
that
you
say
showed
that
these
activities
of
peterson
were
definitely
affected?
justice
kennedy
i
thought
you
said
it
was
the
government's
evidence?
justice
kennedy
all
right.
justice
kennedy
but
you
made
the
statement
that
the
government's
own
evidence
showed
that
all
other
lands,
or
substantial
other
lands,
i
interpreted
your
comment
to
mean,
were
affected.
this
again
refers
just
to
the
4,400
acres.
justice
kennedy
we're
right
back
to
where
we're
started.
justice
kennedy
well,
are
we
talking
about
discrete
mining
parcels
in
a
single
area,
4,400
acres,
or
are
we
talking
about
4,400
acres,
sum
total,
scattered
over
150?
justice
kennedy
so
even
greater
than
the
150?
