justice
o'connor
mr.
roberts,
do
we
have
to
know
exactly
what's
challenged
by
the
plaintiffs
below
in
order
to
answer
the
question
of
standing?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
one
of
the
allegations,
for
example,
is
that
the
reclassification
requires
the
preparation
of
environmental
impact
statements.
justice
o'connor
and,
of
course,
if
the...
if
ms.
peterson
did
have
standing
and
was
able
to
argue
that
point,
then
it
would
have
an
effect
nationwide,
i
assume.
justice
o'connor
--accompanying
a
memorandum?
justice
o'connor
you
said
five
supplemental
memoranda.
justice
o'connor
you
mean
the
affidavits--
justice
o'connor
--that
accompanied
the
memoranda.
justice
o'connor
--well,
mr.
prettyman,
i
don't
see
what
that
has
to
do
with
whether
the
peterson
affidavit
gives
adequate
standing
to
the
plaintiff.
i
mean,
there
is
some
argument
about
the
extent
to
which
the
government
had
proceeded,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
may
go
to
the
scope
of
relief
or
something
of
that
sort.
i
don't
see
why
that
determines
whether
the
plaintiffs
had
standing.
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
we
disagree
with
you
and
think
that
since
the
rules
don't
permit
post-hearing
affidavits,
therefore
there
was
no
abuse
of
discretion
and
we're
left
with
the
peterson
affidavit?
justice
o'connor
but
that
isn't
before
us
here.
here
you
have
a
district
court
judge
that
did
not
expressly
authorize
the
filing
of
supplemental
affidavits
and
that
ruled
that
it
wouldn't...
they
wouldn't
be
considered.
so
the
question
is
whether
that
amounts
to
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
o'connor
and
that
question
is
before
us?
justice
o'connor
right.
so
we
have
to
look
at
it
as...
as
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
looked
at
it
at
the
time.
justice
o'connor
well,
the
question
is
whether
we
can
assume
that
her
recreational
use
was
on
or
in
the
4,500
acres.
that's
the
question.
justice
o'connor
well,
it's
a
little
vague.
that's
the
question
before
us.
she
doesn't
say
in
the
vicinity
of
the
4,500
acres.
she
says,
in
the
vicinity
of
the
green
mountain/south
pass
area--
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
prettyman
says
we
should
look
at
only
156,000
acres,
i
thought.
