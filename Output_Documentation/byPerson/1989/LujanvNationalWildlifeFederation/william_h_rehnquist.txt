chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
now
in
89-460,
manuel
lujan
v.
national
wildlife
federation.
mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
roberts,
does
the
term
south
pass/green
mountains
area
have
some
connotation
in
the
blm's
undertaking
or
was
that
just
an
area
designated
by
ms.
peterson?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
know
that,
but
is
it
anything
more
than
just
a
geographical
designation
selected
by
the...
by
ms.
peterson?
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
there
an
effort
to
depose
the
plaintiffs
in
the
first
part
of
the
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
prettyman?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
you
raise
that
point
in
your
memorandum
in
opposition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
aware
of
the
rule
of
oklahoma
city
against
tuttle,
as
codified
in
our
new
rules,
that
any
point
that
is
not...
does
not
go
to
our
jurisdiction
that
should
counsel
against
the
grant
of
certiorari
must
be
raised
in
the
memorandum
in
opposition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--presumably
the
best
time
for
the
court
to
have
made
that
decision
would
have
been
at
the
stage
were
certiorari
was
being
granted.
that's
the
reason
for
the
rule
and
for
the
statement
in
oklahoma
city
against
tulsa...
tuttle,
that
if
a
case
doesn't
belong
here,
we
would
like
to
find
out
about
it
before
we
grant
certiorari
and
not
during
the
oral
argument.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
thought
they
were
affidavits,
mr.
prettyman--
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
district
court
held
you
to
the
rule,
and
you
say
because...
did
you
object
to
their
factual
statements
and
their
argument?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
district
of
columbia
doesn't
practice
under
the
federal
rules?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
he
gave
you
permission
to
file
memoranda,
not
affidavits.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
maybe
he
couldn't.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
do
we
have
to
face
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
if...
we
don't
ordinarily
pass
on
questions
that
the
court
of
appeals
hasn't
passed
on.
if
we
find
there's
no
standing
under
the
peterson
affidavit
and
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
the
abuse
of
discretion
point,
presumably
it
would
be
open
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand
to
consider
whether
there
is
informational
standing
or
whatever
you
call
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
if
we
didn't
determine
that,
we
would
simply
send
it
back,
and
it
would
be
an
open
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it's
in
the
vicinity
of.
i
mean,
that's
an
additional
qualification.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
thought...
go
ahead
and
finish
your
answer
to
justice
scalia.
chief
justice
rehnquist
191a.
not
of
the
joint
appendix,
but
of
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--the
petition
appendix.
what
page?
191a.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
let's...
before
we
take
paragraph
6
take
paragraph
3.
"i
use
the
federal
lands
including
those
in
the
vicinity
of
the
south
pass/green
mountain
area
of
wyoming
for
recreational
purposes.
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
say
that
the...
the
federal
lands
that
would
be
embraced
within
that
area
are
no
more
than
150,000
acres?
chief
justice
rehnquist
those
are
the
federal
lands
that
are
included
within
that
area?
chief
justice
rehnquist
scrap...
scrap
was
on
a
motion
to
dismiss.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
scrap
was
a
five...
five
to
four
opinion.
it
was
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
and
the
court
said
that
the
standard
might
be
different
on
summary
judgment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it...
it's...
vaguer
than
that,
i
think,
mr.
prettyman,
because
the...
the
distance
between
south
pass
and
the
green
mountains
in
wyoming
is
many...
you
know,
what,
50
miles,
something
like
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--which
is
a
much
larger
area.
whatever...
whatever
lands
she
was
talking
about,
she
did
allege
that
her
use
of
those
lands
was
adversely
affected.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
prettyman.
mr.
roberts,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
the
case
is
submitted.
