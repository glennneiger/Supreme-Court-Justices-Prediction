well,
mr.
nance,
is
it
fair
to
say
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
sympathy
instruction
is
required,
or
did
they
merely
say
that
an
anti-sympathy
instruction
is
prohibited?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
it
was
prohibited,
the
reason
for
prohibiting
it
is
that
they
interpreted,
whether
rightly
or
wrongly,
locket
as
saying
an
instruction
which
interferes
with
the
jury's
consideration
of
all
mitigating
circumstances
is
invalid.
so,
if
they're
right,
it's
because
they
correctly
interpreted
lockett.
if
they're
wrong,
it's
because
they
incorrectly
interpreted
lockett.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it...
lockett
invalidated
an
instruction
which
prohibited
the
consideration
of
all
mitigating
circumstances.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
what
this
court
thought
it
was
doing,
was
invalidating
an
instruction
which
interfered
with
the
consideration
of
mitigating
instruction.
it
may
have
been
wrong,
i'm
not
saying
that.
but
if
they're
right,
it's
because
they
correctly
interpreted
a
case
that
had
been
on
the
books
for
many
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they're
right.
but,
of
course,
i'm
not...
and
i
understand
you've,
of
course,
argued
to
the
contrary
on
the
merits.
but
i
think
if
it's...
if
they're
right,
it's
not
a
new
rule.
that's
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
went
beyond
lockett,
obviously
it
is.
if
it's
within
lockett,
obviously
it's
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
question
really
is
whether
it's
within
lockett
or
beyond
lockett.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
a
little
different--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--isn't
the
point
just
a
little
different
than
that,
ms.
berger?
that
if
the
fact
or
circumstance
that
the
jury
is
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
it
qualifies
as
mitigating,
is
a
fact
that
evokes
sympathy
for
the
defendant,
then
the
fact
that
it
evokes
sympathy
would
disqualify
it
from
being
mitigating
under
this
instruction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
really
isn't
the
tension
that
justice
scalia
finds
difficult
understanding.
