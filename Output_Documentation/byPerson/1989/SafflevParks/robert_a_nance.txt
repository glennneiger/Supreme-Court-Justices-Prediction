mr.
robert
a.
nance
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
we
ask
the
court
to
decide
whether
the
state
may
prohibit
jury
sympathy
in
capital
sentencing
or,
conversely,
whether
the
eighth
amendment
requires
defendants
be
permitted
an
appeal
to
the
sympathy
of
the
jury.
because
we
believe
that
a
sympathy
plea
is
not
constitutionally
required,
we
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
the
respondent
was
convicted
in
the
shooting
murder
of
a
gas
station
attendant
in
oklahoma
city.
during
the
sentencing
phase
of
the
trial,
the
court
told
the
jury
that
it
must
consider
eight
minimum
mitigating
circumstances,
and,
in
addition,
that
the
jury
should
consider
any
other
or
additional
mitigating
circumstances,
if
any,
that
they
may
find
from
the
evidence
to
exist
in
the
case.
thus,
consistent
with
oklahoma
law,
this
instruction
to
the
jury
left
the
jury's
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence
wide
open,
based
upon
the
testimony
at
trial.
the
prosecutor
discussed
in
his
closing
each
of
the
eight
minimum
mitigating
circumstances
in
turn
and
told
the
jury
that
they
had
to
consider
them.
in
addition,
the
prosecutor
told
the
jury
that
they
could
consider
anything
else
they
found
in
the
record
that
might
outweigh
the
aggravating
circumstances
in
the
case.
this
much
we
assume
is
unobjectionable.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
it
did--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--i
did,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
your
honor,
i've
thought
some
about
that,
and,
of
course,
we
did
not
consider
that
in
the
court
below.
but
under
teague,
before
adopting
the
rule
that
the
respondent
asserts,
i
think
you
need
to
determine,
yes,
whether
as
a
new
rule
and
whether
it
is
dictated
by--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--your
honor,
if
you
feel
that
you
need
to
look
at
it,
i
think
teague
would
compel
the
conclusion
that
the
rule
advanced
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
a
new
rule
because
that
rule
was
not
dictated
by
precedent
in
force
at
the
time
mr.
parks'
conviction
became
final.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
your
honor,
i'm
unaware
of
any
authority
from
this
court
that
existed
when
his...
mr.
parks'
conviction
became
final
which
would
have
prohibited,
or
which
would
have
required,
a
sympathy
plea
that
would
have
barred
the
state...
put
on
the
state
essentially
the
duty
of
permitting
a
sympathy
plea.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
i
don't
think
the
anti-sympathy
instruction
negates
the
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence.
clearly
the
rule
was
that
the
jury
had
to
consider
the
mitigating
evidence.
i
don't
think
until
the
california
versus
brown
there
was
any
hint
from
this
court
that
sympathy
had
to
be
a
part
of
that
consideration.
and,
of
course,
i
don't
think
california
versus
brown
compels
the
conclusion
that
sympathy
is
required
anyway.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
that's
entirely
correct,
and
if
the
court
were
to
reach
a
rule
in
this
case
that
sympathy...
a
sympathy
plea
was
required,
as
the
court
of
appeals
felt
it
was,
i
think
that
would
be
a
new
rule,
because
it
wouldn't
be
dictated
by
any
precedent
that
existed
when
mr.
parks'
conviction--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--i
think
the
latter
is
the
more
precise
formulation
of
what
they
said,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
well,
mills
more
than
lockett.
i
mean,
i'd
concede
lockett
says
you
have
to
consider
mitigating
evidence.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
if
they're
right--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--i
think
that
would
be
correct,
and--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--well,
i...
i
may
need
to
back
up
on
that,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
think
lockett
talked
about
the
emotional
state
or
the
sympathy
element
of
consideration.
and
i
think
that
the
rule
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
announced
went
beyond
lockett.
i'd
still
think
it
would
be
a
new
rule.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
i
think
i'd
have
to
agree
with
that.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
and...
and...
yes.
and,
of
course,
our
view
is
they
went
beyond
lockett.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
i
don't
know
if
there
is
a
difference,
your
honor,
between
interpreting
and
projecting.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
put
upon
the
state
a
burden
that
did
not
exist
previously
and
that
was
to
permit
a
sympathy
plea
to
the
jury.
that's
why
i
say
this
would
be
a
new
rule.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
well,
if...
yes.
if
it
is...
if
it
is
a
valid
interpretation
of
lockett,
i
think
it's
dictated
by
lockett.
i
don't
think
that
this
rule
is
dictated
by
lockett.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
well,
no,
your
honor.
i
think
even
if
i
thought
it
were
right,
it
would
be
a
new...
it
would
be
a
new
rule,
it
would
impose
a
new
duty
on
the
states.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
oh,
no.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
no,
i
think
to
be
a
new
rule
it
has
to
be...
it
has
to
be
something
that
was
not
dictated.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
no,
i
don't
think
i--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--no.
i
think
cases
like
eddings
and
skipper
were
dictated
by
lockett
because
they
dealt
with
the
consideration,
the
fact
of
the
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence.
i
think
this
case
is
not
dictated
by
lockett
because
it
deals
with
the
manner
in
which
that
evidence
was
considered,
which
is
essentially
sympathetically,
and
i
don't
see
that
as
being
dictated
by
lockett.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
that's
correct.
that
would
be
my
position,
your
honor.
right
or
wrong,
i
don't
see
that
this
was
dictated
by
lockett,
the
court
of
appeals
rule.
the
jury
in
this
case...
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
unconstitutional
about
this
instruction
was
that
portion,
of
course,
that
said
that
you
shall
not
let
any
influence
of
sympathy,
sentiment,
passion
or
prejudice
enter
into
your
deliberation
or
any
other
arbitrary
factor.
that
instruction
went
on
to
say
that
you
should
discharge
your
duties
impartially,
conscientiously
and
faithfully
under
your
oaths
and
return
such
a
verdict
as
is
warranted
by
the
evidence
when
measured
by
these
instructions.
we
think
that
unlike
the
cases
in
which
this
court
has
struck
down
death
penalties
based
upon
questions
of
mitigating
evidence,
this
instruction,
either
from
the
court
or
from
the
prosecutor,
did
not
construct
any
artificial
barrier
to
the
fact
of
the
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence.
the
respondent
was
completely
free
to
introduce
any
mitigating
evidence
he
chose.
the
jury
heard
that
evidence,
and
was
told
to
consider
it.
we
don't
think
that
this
instruction
can
fairly
be
considered
as
one
which
would
trick
the
jury
into
not
considering
the
mitigating
evidence.
as
i
say,
by
its
terms
the
instruction
did
not
affect
the
fact
of
consideration
or
weighing
or
reporting
to
the
court,
as
was
the
case
in
mills
or
in
penry,
but
merely
dealt
with
the
manner
in
which
the
evidence
should
be
weighed.
we
think
a
reasonable
juror
in
this
case
would
have
no
difficulty
in
interpreting
the
language
challenged.
they
would
understand
it
clearly
and
that
understanding
would
be
this:
the
jury
had
a
duty
to
consider
the
evidence
both
aggravating
and
mitigating
conscientiously,
impartially
and
faithfully,
and
not
with
sympathy,
sentiment,
passion,
prejudice,
or
any
other
arbitrary
emotional
state.
we
think
this
instruction
resulted
in
a
sober
and
conscientious
exercise
of
the
duty
to
weigh
the
evidence
and
to
reach
a
sentence,
and
that
the
instruction
told
the
jury
how
to
consider
that
evidence.
we
think
the
instruction
told
the
jury
how
to
consider
the
evidence
in
a
way
which
is
entirely
consistent
with
this
court's
law
on
rational
and
reliable
capital
sentencing
based
upon
objective
factors.
if
we
must
go
beyond
the
specific
language
challenged,
we
believe
that
instruction
no.
6
on
the
eight
minimum
mitigating
circumstances
and
the
wide
open
catchall
provision
of
that
instruction
adequately
informed
the
jury
of
its
obligation
to
consider
mitigating
evidence.
thus,
we
believe
the
constitutional
prerequisite
which
is
consideration
of
the
evidence
rather
than
sympathy
was
met
in
this
case.
the
court
has
said,
and
i
think
said
correctly,
that
capital
sentencing
should
be
a
reasoned,
moral
response
to
the
crime
and
to
the
criminal.
in
reaching
that
reasoned,
moral
response,
the
sentencing
jury
should
hear
whatever
element
the
defendant
might
advance
from
his
character
or
his
record
or
the
circumstances
of
the
offense
which
might
reduce
his
moral
culpability
or
his
guilt,
which
should
be
the
focus
in
sentencing.
this
produces
a
sentencing
procedure
which
is
sensible
to
the
uniqueness
of
the
individual
and
permits
the
jury
to
know
whatever
the
defendant
wants
to
offer
about
himself
or
his
background
or
the
crime.
this
sort
of
sentencing
procedure
which
is,
i
think,
advanced
by
this
instruction,
helps
eliminate
the
caprice
or
emotion
which
the
court
has
struck
down
on
one
extreme,
or
helps
avoid
a
mechanistic
or
unreasoning
automatic
death
sentence
which
the
court
has
struck
down
on
the
other
hand.
the
respondent
could
and
did
submit
mitigating
evidence
in
this
case.
his
father
testified
that
he
was
a
happy-go-lucky
sort
of
fellow,
that
he
had
had
a
troubled
home
life
growing
up.
the
jury
heard
that
without
impediment
from
either
the
court
or
the
prosecutor.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
we
think
leads
us
to
believe
fairly
that
the
jury
failed
to
consider
that
evidence.
nothing
detracted
from
the
consideration
of
that
evidence.
we
merely
submitted
to
that
jury
an
instruction
which
diverted
their
consideration
away
from
extraneous
emotional
factors
and
toward
the
evidence
which
had
been
submitted.
we
think
that
emotional
response
to
the
evidence,
which
is
what
we
understand
sympathy
to
be,
in
no
way
contributes
to
the
reasoned
moral
response
that
capital
sentencing
should
be.
we
think
that
sympathy,
as
the
court
said
in
brown,
is
among
a
catalog
of
things
which
could
improperly
influence
the
sentence,
and
we
need
not
have
permitted
the
jury
to
consider
it...
or,
to
employ
it
in
its
consideration
of
the
evidence.
the
court
has
said,
and
again
i
believe
correctly,
that
sentencing
should
not
be
based
on
emotional
factors
which
are
wholly
unrelated
to
the
blameworthiness
of
the
defendant.
we
want
the
jury
to
soberly
consider
that
blameworthiness,
the
factors
in
aggravation
and
in
mitigation,
and
come
to
a
reasoned
sentencing
decision.
we
think
this
instruction
is
proper
in
a
case...
in
a
system
of
sentencing
in
which
the
punishment
is
directly
related
to
the
moral
culpability
or
guilt
of
the
defendant.
we
think
it
helped
advance
the
reasoned
moral
response
to
the
crime
to
the
criminal,
which
should
be
the
hallmark
of
capital
sentencing,
rather
than
an
emotional
response
to
the
evidence.
we
think
this
case
presents
something
of
a
fork
in
the
road
for
the
court.
the
road,
of
course,
leads
to
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence
and
the
sort
of
objective
sentencing
which
this
court
has
sought
in
capital
cases.
one
fork
in
the
road
would
invalidate
death
penalties
which
are
otherwise
complete
and
acceptable
in
their
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence.
if
the
jury
was
not
permitted
to
hear
the
sympathy
plea,
that
fork
in
the
road
increases
the
discretion
of
appellate
courts
to
set
aside
death
penalties
if
they
find,
as
this
court
of
appeals
found,
that
the
sentencing
jury
did
not
fully
consider
the
evidence
with
the
proper
emotional
or
mental
framework.
the
second
fork
in
the
road,
and
we
think
the
sounder
course,
would
leave
intact
death
penalties
in
which
the
jury
was
properly
instructed
and
did
in
fact
consider
the
mitigating
evidence
and,
in
which
the
state,
as
here,
guided
that
consideration
in
a
way
that
makes
the
sentencing
decision
more
rational
and
reliable.
again,
this
instruction
told
the
jury
how
to
consider
the
evidence.
the
duty
to
consider
mitigating
evidence
in
this
case
was
clear
and
unequivocable.
we
think
that
only
if
the
sympathy
ploy
is
constitutionally
required
could
this
jury
sentence
be
set
aside.
we
think
the
irony
of
all
of
this
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
abandoned
the
protection
for
capital
defendants
which
has
been
built
into
capital
sentencing
in
the
form
of
rational
and
reliable
sentencing
based
upon
objective
factors
which
are
plain
in
the
record
and
open
to
sensible
appellate
review.
instead
of
taking
that
approach,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
jury
should
be
able
to
hear
the
evidence
in
the
natural
and
significant
way,
which
was
sympathetically.
we
think
that,
as
the
court
said
in
brown,
sympathy
is
far
more
likely
to
cut
against
the
defendant
than
for
him.
we
also
think
that
in
a
sense,
capital
sentencing
is
not
a
natural
proceeding
for
a
lay
jury.
it's
not
something
that
they
should
do
spontaneously
and
without
direction.
quite
the
contrary.
it's
something
unnatural
in
that
this
court
has
said
that
their
discretion
should
be
guided
and
directed
by
the
state.
and
we
think
properly
so
in
this
case.
a
natural--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--i
suppose
we
could
do
that,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
robert
a.
nance
--i'm
aware
that
they
do,
but
it's
just
been
our
historical
approach
to
permit
jury
sentencing
in
oklahoma,
and
that's
been
our
approach
since
long
before
this
body
of
eighth
amendment
law
evolved.
but
since
we
have
chosen
in
oklahoma
to
use
jury
sentencing,
i
think
we
can
properly
channel
that
discretion
toward
a
more
rational
and
reliable
sentence.
we
think
the
natural
response
to
the
evidence
in
sentencing
would
be
more
likely
to
give
vent
to
the
community's
outrage
and
concern
over
the
crime
than
to
somehow
sympathize
with
the
defendant.
we
find
nothing
in
this
instruction
which
barred
giving
effect
to
the
respondent's
mitigating
evidence.
there
was
no
external
barrier
to
the
jury's
consideration
of
that
mitigating
evidence.
there
was
no
external
barrier
to
the
jury
giving
effect
to
that
mitigating
evidence.
under
these
instructions,
the
jury
had
to
consider
the
evidence,
mitigating
evidence,
and
simply
weigh
it
conscientiously,
faithfully,
and
soberly
against
the
aggravating
factor
which
they
found.
they
were
entirely
free
to
do
that
and
we
find
nothing
in
this
record
which
indicates
that
they
did
not
do
it.
we
think
that
only
by
getting
into
the
mental
and
emotional
status
of
the
jury
did
the
court
of
appeals
find
any
reason
whatsoever
to
set
aside
this
jury's
sentence.
the
constitutional
prerequisite,
which
is
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence,
was
fulfilled.
this
instruction
contributed
to
rational
and
reliable
sentencing
based
upon
objective
factors,
and
we
believe
is
entirely
appropriate.
we
ask
the
court
to
reject
the
invitation
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
what
we
think
would
be
more
subjective
capital
sentencing
and
to
adhere
to
the
sounder
precedence
requiring
objective
sentencing.
we,
therefore,
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
robert
a.
nance
your
honor,
unless
the
court
has
some
further
questions,
i
have
no
rebuttal.
