ms.
vivian
berger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
you
today,
i
believe,
is
a
fairly
narrow
one.
whether
reasonable
jurors
could
have
understood
sympathy,
as
referred
to
in
the
anti-sympathy
instruction
in
this
case,
and
in
related
comments
by
the
prosecutor,
to
be
a
proxy
for
respondent's
mitigating
evidence
concerning
his
background
and
could
thereby
have
believed,
unlike
the
jurors
in
california
versus
brown,
that
they
could
not
give
effect
in
their
verdict
to
mr.
parks'
mitigating
case.
now,
as
the
court
of
appeals
majority
clearly
recognized...
and
this
i
believe
also
was
the
tendency
of
justice
stevens'
remarks...
mr.
parks
asserts
no
constitutional
right
to
a
sympathetic
or
emotional
jury.
what
he
does
assert
under
woodson,
lockett,
eddings
and
their
progeny
is
the
entirely
familiar
claim
upheld
consistently
by
this
court
of
a
right
to
a
sentencer
who
has
not
been
precluded
from
considering
as
a
mitigating
factor
any
aspect
of
a
defendant's
background,
character
or
record
in
addition
to
the
circumstances
of
his
offense
that
he
proffers
as
a
basis
for
a
sentence
less
than
death.
it
is
for
that
reason
as
well
that
we
are
not
contending
for
a
new
rule
in
the
sense
of
teague.
mr.
parks'
cutoff
date,
if
you
will,
in
certiorari
was
denied
from
his
direct
appeal;
the
judgment
in
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
was
january
17th,
1983.
thus,
for
purposes
relevant
under
teague,
it
is
noteworthy
that
mr.
parks
finds
himself
in
the
precise
position
as
mr.
penry
who,
of
course,
was
also
asserting
a
lockett
claim
which
the
majority
of
this
court
held
was
permissible
to
assert,
not
withstanding
teague.
in
other
words,
mr.
parks,
like
mr.
penry,
has
the
benefit
of
the
decisions
in
woodson
and
in
lockett
and
in
eddings,
and
those
are
the
decisions
that
in
fact
support
his
claim.
i
would
only
add
in
that
respect,
unless
the
court
wishes
to
discuss
teague
further,
that--
ms.
vivian
berger
--yes,
your--
ms.
vivian
berger
--well,
your
honor,
of
course
the
answer
to
a
question
like
that
would
always
depend
on
how
narrowly
or
broadly
one
frames
the
rule.
ms.
vivian
berger
well,
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
virtually
any
issue
that
comes
through
the
courts
in
these
test
cases,
and
certainly
one
that
ends
up
in
this
court,
involves
something
that
is
open
to
question.
you,
of
course,
wrote--
ms.
vivian
berger
--yes,
your
honor,
but
notably
it
did
so.
and
i
would
believe
in
this
line-drawing
that
the
rationale
for
a
decision
is
very
important.
that
the
whole
rationale
of
california
versus
brown
flowed
directly
from
the
woodson,
lockett,
eddings
line
of
cases.
that
the--
ms.
vivian
berger
--that
was
because
that
instruction,
your
honor,
as
read
by
the
court,
simply
precluded
factually
untethered
sympathy
and
i
believe
certainly
the
majority
opinion
may
explain,
as
of
course
does
the
dissent,
that
factually
tethered
sympathy
under
this
long
line
of
precedence
would
have
to
be
considered.
ms.
vivian
berger
oh,
yes.
ms.
vivian
berger
your
honor,
with
respect,
what
is
more
important
than
what
the
court
had
in
mind...
and
you
may
well
be
correct
as
to
what
the
court
had
in
mind...
is,
of
course,
what
a
reasonable
juror
could
understand.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
every
respect
deemed
relevant
in
the
court's
opinion
in
the
brown
case,
this
instruction
differs
in
a
way
favoring
our
interpretation
or
certainly
making
our
interpretation
of
what
a
juror
could
understand
plausible,
both
in
what
it
puts
into
the
instruction
and
in
what
it
omits.
what
the
instruction
omitted
here,
which
chief
justice
rehnquist's
opinion
found
so
crucial,
was
the
word
"mere
sympathy"
which
certainly
does
tend
to
convey
an
arbitrariness
like
sentiment
or
passion
or
prejudice.
but
not
only
did
the
instruction
here
not
contain
the
word
"mere",
it
very
clearly
equated
sympathy
with
other
arbitrary
factors.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
mere
sympathy
that
is
an
arbitrary
factor.
it
is
all
sympathy.
and
while
of
course
this
court
may
read
the
instruction
as
it
will,
i
think
it
is
interesting
that,
as
far
as
i
understand
my
opponent's
argument,
he
concedes
our
reading
at
least
as
a
plausible
reading
of
the
instruction.
ms.
vivian
berger
no,
your
honor.
ms.
vivian
berger
it
was
decided,
i
guess
in
1987.
ms.
vivian
berger
and--
ms.
vivian
berger
--,
at
least
some
members
of
this
court
thought
that
the
rule
for
which
mr.
penry
was
contending
was
a
little
bit
difficult
to
say
was
dictated
by
precedent
in
light
of
the
jurek
precedent,
quite
on
point
in
relation
to
the
texas
system.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
having
crossed
that
rubicon,
whatever
the
precise
meaning
of
dictated
is...
and,
as
you
know,
the
court
used
other
formulations
like
clear
break
or
imposing
new
obligation
on
the
states,
somewhat
more
generous
formulations.
but
certainly
it
seems
that
if
penry's
rule
is
not
a
new
rule
in
light
of
jurek
that
came
before,
our
rule--
ms.
vivian
berger
--cannot
be
either.
ms.
vivian
berger
excuse
me.
ms.
vivian
berger
well,
your
honor,
i
would
take
it
that
the
purpose
of
teague
must
flow
from
the
purpose
of
habeas
corpus.
to
draw
on
mr.
justice
harlan's
comments
over
the
years,
certainly
he
alluded,
as
i
believe
you
are
alluding,
to
the
deterrence
or
incentive
function
of
habeas
corpus,
if
you
will,
bringing
state
judges
into
line
to
act
constitutionally.
but
justice
harlan
also
alluded
to
the
broader
purpose
of
essentially
enhancing
the
accuracy
of
procedures
and
in
this
case,
of
course
one
mainly
talks
about
convictions
in
this
context.
but
the
rule
that
we
are
contending,
which
once
again
we
believe
is
firmly
grounded
in
woodson
and
lockett,
those
early
decisions,
tends
to
enhance
the
accuracy
of
sentencing
in
terms
of
the
reliability.
because
if
there
is
one
thing
that
this
court
has
said
over-and-over
and
over-and-over
in
various
contexts
is
that
the
sentencer
may
not
be
precluded
from
considering
mitigating
evidence,
from
considering
it
as
justice
o'connor
said
in
penry
and
as
others
have
said
at
other
times,
fully.
and,
of
course,
the
whole
point
of
this
is
that
after
considering
evidence
fully...
not
just
hearing
it...
but
having
no
barriers
to
its
full
consideration...
then
the
jury
may
arrive
at
a
reasoned
moral
response.
ms.
vivian
berger
no,
your
honor.
but,
of
course,
you
were
the
author
of
the
majority
opinion
in
california
versus
brown
and
you
know
best
precisely
what
you--
ms.
vivian
berger
--well,
then
perhaps
i
had
better...
drawing
simply
from
the
opinion
itself
and
not
attempting
to
mind-read
each
other,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
opinion
said
that
the
word
"mere"
was
very
important,
was
indeed
crucial.
and
while
it
is
not
the
object
of
this
court
to
write
a
code
of
instructions
or
to
be
highly
technical
or
so
forth,
inevitably
in
reading
instructions
one
must
of
course
parse
the
language
and
then
the
broader
surroundings,
the
other
instructions
and
so
forth,
in
the
case.
here,
unlike
in
brown,
it
was
not
mere
sympathy,
it
was
all
sympathy
that
was
equated
with
arbitrary
factors.
that
was
precisely
the
problem.
and
there
are
also
other
things.
ms.
vivian
berger
well,
that
is
how--
ms.
vivian
berger
--judge
anderson
read
it,
your
honor.
i
happen
to
believe
that
that
is
not
a
very
natural
reading
of
the
language.
but
even
if
it
were
a
plausible
reading,
as
your
honors
know,
two
competing
plausible
readings
are
not
sufficient
when
one
would
lead
to
an
unconstitutional
result,
which
is
our
claim.
ms.
vivian
berger
,
i
believe
the
tests
recently
stated
and
adhered
to
by
the
court
are
as
follows,
and
they
probably
boil
down
to
the
same
thing:
california
versus
brown,
drawing
on
francis
versus
franklin,
sandstrom
versus
montana
looked
to
what
a
reasonable
juror
could
understand.
if
a
reasonable
juror
could
understand
the
instruction
in
the
impermissible
way,
then
the
instruction
cannot
stand.
in
mills,
the
court
talked
with
various
formulations
going
to
possibility,
i
think...
probably
settled
on
the
formulation
of
a
substantial
possibility
that
the
instruction
was
read
in
the
wrong
way.
i
don't
know
if
that
means
anything
different,
but
i
am
certainly
willing
to
rest
on
the
notion
of
what
a
reasonable
juror
could
have
understood.
also
look
at
other
differences
from
california
versus
brown.
another
thing
that
the
court
relied
on
heavily
in
brown
was
the
surrounding
circumstances.
mr.
brown
had
put
in
13
witnesses
in
mitigation...
three
days
of
mitigating
testimony...
and
the
court
understandably
said...
this
court...
this
isn't
the
kind
of
thing
that
a
jury
would
probably
think
it
ought
to
ignore.
whereas,
the
evidence
in
this
case,
while
clearly
classical
evidence
of
mitigation
going
to
respondent's
disadvantaged
background,
was
definitely
sparse.
it
was
contained
in
fact
in
five
pages
of
direct
testimony
by
mr.
parks'
father.
to
use
justice
brennan's
words,
a
jury
might
well
have
thought
that
this
was
simply
an
instance
where
the
defendant
went
too
far
in
hearing
the
injunction
that
they
were
supposed
to
avoid
sympathy.
it
has
always
been
interesting
to
me
in
this
case
that
the
state
has
relied
on
the
prosecutor's
comments
in
the
case
to
fix
matters
while
i
think
it's
imminently
clear
that
what
the
prosecutor's
comments
did
was
to
make
matters
much
worse,
because
he
very
clearly
not
only
delivered
his
own
anti-sympathy
charge
a
couple
of
times,
but
made
it
very
clear
that
background
evidence
was
just
a
pitch
for
sympathy
and
you
promised
me
in
voir
dire
you
wouldn't
do
that,
said
the
prosecutor
in
his
closing
penalty
summation.
equally,
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
did
kind
of
a
routine
cook's
tour
through
the
so-called
minimum
mitigating
circumstances
didn't
help
in
any
way
because
all
of
those
minimum
mitigating
circumstances
in
oklahoma
but
one,
go
only
to
the
circumstances
of
the
offense
or
the
defendant's
condition
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
equally,
other
mitigation
such
as
mr.
mckinney,
the
prosecutor,
dealt
with
extremely
briefly.
mr.
mckinney
in
no
way
mentioned
any
of
this
troubled
background
evidence.
mr.
mckinney
simply
mentioned
what
mr.
nance
mentioned
about
the
happy-go-lucky
nature
of
the
respondent
in
this
case,
as
his
father
called
it,
and
also
commented
on
respondent's
criminal
conviction
and
other
bad
acts
in
his
past.
there
was
nothing
in
this
case
that
would
lead
this
jury,
really,
to
believe
anything
other
than
sympathy
type
evidence
was
something
you
couldn't
consider
and--
ms.
vivian
berger
--okay.
and,
in
fact,
turning
to
those
instructions,
the
instructions
to
which
you're
referring,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
are
contained
both
in
no.
9
which
also
contains
the
anti-sympathy
instruction,
and
no.
6,
which
are
set
forth
generally
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
10
to
13.
i
am
now
looking
at
page
13
and
just
picking
out
one
myself
in
addition.
at
the
bottom
of
the
first
paragraph
there,
after
talking
about
the
fact
that
these
are
all
the
instructions
in
the
case,
they
give
you
the
law,
and
then
the
court
says,
"you
must
consider
them
all
together
and
not
a
part
of
them
to
the
exclusion
of
the
rest.
"
in
other
words,
of
course
there
is
this
boilerplate
language
about
look
at
the
facts,
look
at
the
evidence,
and
listen
to
the
instructions.
but
notably
also,
listen
to
the
anti-sympathy
instruction.
and
even
in
that
instruction
itself,
which
is
the
next
paragraph
down
on
page
13,
like
most
instructions,
it's
a
mixture
of
language,
as
mr.
nance
pointed
out.
after
the
anti-sympathy
part,
yes,
the
court
says
discharge
your
duties
impartially,
look
at
the
evidence,
return
such
verdict
as
the
evidence
warrants
when
measured
by
these
instructions.
well,
the
cat's
turning
on
its
tail
again
because
these
instructions
include
not
only
the
anti-sympathy
instruction
given
immediately
before,
but
also,
by
virtue
of
an
earlier
pickup
charge,
include
any
and
all
of
the
guilt
phase
instructions
that
the
jurors
may
happen
to
think
applicable.
the
jurors
were
not
further
guided.
and
in
the
guilt
phase
as
well,
there
was
an
anti-sympathy
instruction.
so
it
seems
to
me
one
can
say
really
two
things.
in
order
to
say
that
the
rest
of
the
instructions
cured
any
problem
with
the
anti-sympathy
instruction,
you
would
either
have
to
say
essentially
that
the
general
controls
the
specific,
which
would
be
the
opposite
of
the
usual
approach,
or
would
have
to
rest
frankly
with
conflicting
instructions.
that,
too,
as
this
court
has
often
stated,
is
impermissible
when
one
of
the
instructions
in
context
could
be
read
in
a
constitutionally
impermissible
manner.
ms.
vivian
berger
well,
i
agree--
ms.
vivian
berger
--well,
of
course,
that
goes
also
to
what
a
juror
believes
mitigating
circumstances
are
which
were
not
otherwise
defined
in
these
minimum
mitigating
circumstances
which
happen
to
go
to
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
but
here
i
think
is
where,
in
a
sense,
psychology
enters
in.
i
think
judge
ebel
said
wisely
and
correctly
for
the
majority
below,
"sympathy
may
be
an
important
ingredient
in
understanding
and
appreciating
mitigating
evidence
of
a
defendant's
background
and
character.
"
so
i
think
that
at
least
some
jurors,
reasonable
jurors,
might
have
been
left
somewhat
at
sea.
ms.
vivian
berger
well,
your
honor,
with
respect,
it
was
you,
not
the
court,
that
added
the
term
"mere
sympathy".
i
think
the
problem
is
that
sympathy
may
be
the
way
in
which
people,
at
least
some
people,
some
jurors,
some
reasonable
jurors,
process
the
kind
of
mitigating
evidence
that
we're
talking
about
here,
evidence
of
the
defendant's
disadvantaged
background,
process
that
through
their
minds
in
order
to
arrive
at
a
moral
response
which
can
be
both
reasoned
and
reasonably
sympathetic
at
the
same
time.
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
this
through
the
eyes
of
lay
jurors.
so,
if
on
the
one
hand
they
were
being
told
to
take
everything
into
account,
whatever
you
want,
yet
on
the
other
hand
they
are
being
told
that
they
cannot
consider
that
anything,
that
mitigating
evidence,
in
the
way
which
it
is
most
natural
to
consider
it
if
you
are
inclined,
(a)
to
believe
it,
and
(b)
to
give
it
any
mind
at
all,
then,
as
i
say,
a
juror
is
left
in
a
quandary.
and
this
is--
ms.
vivian
berger
--a
juror
who
i'm
assuming
is
following
directions.
ms.
vivian
berger
well,
i
think
that's
why--
ms.
vivian
berger
--well,
i
think
you
have
put
it
better
than
me
because
what
we
are
really
confronted
here,
if
the
instruction
is
read
in
the
wrong
way
and
followed,
as
we
must
assume
it
is
followed,
is
essentially
an
all
or
nothing
situation.
ms.
vivian
berger
your
honor,
i
think,
again,
that's
a
little
further
twist
on
it.
i
think
a
juror
confronted
with
evidence,
including
this
rather
sparse
mitigating
evidence
concerning
the
defendant's
background
and
saying,
well,
that's
in
the
case
too,
how
do
i
react
to
it,
and
then
remembering
well,
it's
there,
but
i
was
told
i
couldn't
feel
any
sympathy.
and
then
i
think
the
juror
just
sort
of
stops
and
scratches
his
or
her
head
in
some
sense.
that's
the
problem,
because
this
instruction
interferes
with
the
full
consideration
of
mitigating
evidence.
it
is
possible,
justice
scalia,
that
a
juror
could
look
at
this
evidence
and
somehow
approach
it
extremely
rationally
and
ask
himself
or
herself,
well,
does
this
or
does
it
not
in
some
very
reasoned
way
reduce
culpability
or
not
and
in
that
sense
could
consider
it.
on
the
other
hand,
it
is
also
extremely
plausible
that
many
people,
many
reasonable
people,
respond
to
this
sort
of
evidence
with
sympathy
and
that
is
the
way
in
which
they
in
a
sense
say
there
is
less
culpability
here.
there
is
not
less
culpability
because
the
juror
feels
sympathy,
that's
not
the
argument.
but
rather
that
simply,
particularly
lay
people,
tending
to
respond
with
sympathy,
do
so
because
that
is
their
way
of
giving
weight
to
the
mitigating
evidence
in
the
culpability
scale.
yes,
here
it
is.
while
preparing
i
came
across
what
i
think
is
a
good
statement
in
an
en
banc
court
of
appeals
decision
in
a
different
context
from
the
eleventh
circuit.
in
brooks
versus
kemp,
the
en
banc
court
was
considering
whether
certain
prosecutorial
argument
in
the
penalty
phase
was
constitutionally
impermissible
because
it
appealed
too
much
to
emotion.
the
court
rejected
that
claim
and
said,
i
think,
some
things
that
are
also
applicable
in
this
context.
said
that
reason
alone
cannot
adequately
explain
a
jury's
decision
to
grant
mercy
to
a
person
convicted
of
a
serious
murder
because
of
that
person's
youth
or
troubling
personal
problems.
nor
can
reason
alone
explain
fully
the
reaction
of
a
juror
upon
hearing
the
facts
of
a
particular
crime
described
in
their
tragically
specific
detail.
empathy
for
a
defendant's
individual
circumstance
or
revulsion
at
the
moral
affront
of
his
crime,
reactions
accepted
as
basis
for
capital
sentencing
decisions,
are
not
susceptible
to
full
explanation
without
recourse
to
human
emotion.
then
the
court
concludes,
in
the
context
of
that
case,
the
propriety
of
argument
rests
primarily
in
the
relation
of
its
content
to
issues
relevant
to
the
sentencing
jury's
concern.
i
would
rephrase
it
to
our
context
as
follows:
the
propriety
of
sympathy
rests
primarily
in
the
relation
of
it
to
mitigating
evidence
relevant
to
the
sentencing
jury's
concern.
so,
sympathy
is
not
sentiment.
sympathy
is
not
passion.
sympathy
is
not
prejudice.
sympathy
is
not
sentimentality.
it
is
simply
a
way
in
which
many
people,
many
reasonable
people,
will
respond
to
the
sort
of
mitigating
evidence
at
issue
here
if
indeed
they
are
inclined
to
respond
to
at
all.
i
think
the
problem,
justice
scalia,
is
that
at
least
some
jurors
would
have
been
impeded
in
reacting
to
mitigating
evidence
if
they
were
to
follow,
as
we
must
assume
they
followed,
this
instruction.
finally,
i
would
say--
ms.
vivian
berger
--the
moral
worthiness,
your
honor,
is
the
ultimate
question,
and
if
one
were
having
a
dialogue
such
as
we
were
having
now
with
a
juror,
perhaps
one
could
make
these
points
very
expressly.
but
i
do
believe,
in
light
of
human
nature
and
psychology
and
the
fact
that
lay
jurors
are
not
experienced
in
sentencing,
they
may
simply
tend
to
express
a
view
that
someone
deserves
a
bit
less
than
death,
deserves
life
imprisonment
through
the
medium
of...
perhaps
even
empathy
is
a
better
word
than
sympathy
which
is
not
equivalent
to
some
kind
of
wild
irrationality.
i
would
simply
want
to
end
by
placing
the
case
in
what
i
think
is
a
very
important
context:
the
fact
that
this
was
essentially
a
marginal
case
for
death.
by
that
i
do
not
mean
that
a
properly
instructed
juror
was
not
entitled
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
the
jury
would
have
been.
however,
this
was
a
case
with
extremely
light
aggravation
and
very
sadly
routine
murder,
sadly
routine
criminal,
where
the
one
aggravating
factor
found
by
the
jury
was
the
one
that
was
already
instinct
and
obvious
in
the
verdict
on
guilt,
that
mr.
parks
had
killed
in
order
to
avoid
arrest
or
prosecution.
this
was
not
a
case
where
the
prime
problem,
as
i
see
it,
was
likely
tremendous
passion
on
the
side
of
the
victim
other
than,
of
course,
the
natural
sympathy
which
flows
to
the
victim
of
a
murder.
rather,
the
problem
in
this
case
was
very
light
aggravation--
ms.
vivian
berger
--thank
you.
