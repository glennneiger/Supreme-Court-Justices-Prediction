mr.
nance,
the
case
originated...
the
case
that
we're
hearing...
as
a
habeas
review
petition--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--collateral
review?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think,
then,
that
we
have
to
determine
whether
the
rule
sought
would
be
applied
retroactively,
as
suggested
in
teague?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
and
what's
your
position
on
that?
i
know
it
isn't
discussed
in
the
briefs,
and
obviously
teague
came
out
only
last
term.
but
since
it's
something
that
we
may
have
to
look
at,
i'd
be
interested
in
knowing
your
views.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
do
you
say
that?
on
what
do
you
rely
in
making
that
assertion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is
that
locket
and
eddings
were
already
on
the
books
and
they
require
that
you...
that
the
jury
be
permitted
to
consider
and
give
weight
to
evidence
in
mitigation.
now,
does
the
anti-sympathy
instruction
negate
that,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--ms.
berger,
you
think
that
the
rule
sought
by
your
client
was
dictated
by
precedent
at
the
time
concerning
this
particular
instruction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
exactly,
and
i
think...
would
you
acknowledge
that
it
was
at
least
open
to
question
whether
an
instruction
like
this
is
in
violation
of
some
concept
expressed
in
lockett
and
eddings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
have
to
do
some...
some
line-drawing.
and
certainly
in
california
versus
brown,
the
court
upheld
an
anti-sympathy
instruction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
it
concluded
that
that
instruction
didn't
violate
the
constitution.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
isn't
altogether
clear
that
this
instruction
should
be
considered
as
untethered
sympathy
in
any
event.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
instruction
goes
on
to
say
"or
other
arbitrary
factor".
it's
clear
that
what
the
court
had
in
mind
was
the
purely
arbitrary
factors
that
it
chose
to
list.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
had
california
versus
brown
even
been
decided
when
this
conviction
became
final?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
came
later
and
it
upheld
an
anti-sympathy
instruction.
so
it's
a
little...
it
certainly
is
difficult
to
see
how
the
rule
you
want
established
could
be
said
to
be
dictated
by
precedent
existing
at
the
time.
