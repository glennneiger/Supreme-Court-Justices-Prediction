justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
within
or
beyond?
are
you
saying
the
only
new
rules
are
wrong
rules?
justice
antonin
scalia
the...
the
only
time...
you're
saying
no
lower
court
can
ever...
can
ever
fashion
a
new
rule
because
a
lower
court
would
only
be,
as
you
say
or
as
you
acknowledged,
interpreting
lockett?
is
there
no
difference
between
interpreting
and
projecting?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
any...
any
interpretation
of
lockett
that
is
a
valid
interpretation
can
be
said
to
be
something
dictated
by
lockett?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
only
reason
you
say
it's
new
then
is
because
you
think
it's
wrong?
if
you
thought
it
was
right,
it
wouldn't
be
new.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
but
not
if
we
base
it
on
lockett?
we
would
have
to
say
we're
inventing
a
new
rule.
we
couldn't
say,
well,
you
know,
lockett
has
this
general
objective
and
we
think
this
sort
of
furthers
that
so
we
think
it
really
follows
from
lockett.
if
we
said
that,
it's
not
a
new
rule.
you
really
expect
us
to
pluck
a
new
rule
out
of
nowhere
and
not
rely
on
any
prior
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
that's
all
that
teague
means,
and
you
evidently
think
it
is,
then
it
really
doesn't
mean
very
much.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
say
anything
that
could
be
projected
from
a
previous
case
is
dictated
by
it
even
though
a
reasonable
mind
might
project
five
or
six
different
things
and
quite
contradictory.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
five
are
dictated
by
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
really
haven't
come
here
prepared
to
argue
the
teague
point
and
it's
probably
not
fair
to
press
you
on
it.
your
position
on
that,
i
take
it,
would
be
true
under
teague
whether
this
court
were
to
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit
on
the
merits
or
disagree.
there
is
a
category
of
cases,
i
presume,
under
teague
where
even
though
this
court
ends
up
saying,
yes,
the
eighth
amendment
does
require
the
state
courts
to
do
such
and
such
a
thing,
nonetheless,
it
will
also
say
that
this
could
not
have...
this
was
not
dictated
by
prior
cases
under
teague.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that
where
you
draw
the
line
ought
to
depend
on
what
the
purpose
of
the
teague
rule
is.
i
thought
the
purpose
was
to
assure
that
habeas
was
something
that
was
used
to
bring
state
courts
into
line
when
they
are
making
a
sincere
effort
to
follow
federal
law,
not
when
they
happen
to
have
made
a
mistake
about
federal
law.
now,
if
that's
the
purpose
of
teague,
which
i
understood
it
was,
then
i
suppose
we
have
to
adopt
the
line
that
is
closer
to
what
justice
o'connor
expressed
earlier,
whether
indeed
it
was
reasonably
open
to
question
whether
that
was
federal
law
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that
argument
assumes
that
the
two
instructions
are
contradictory.
and
i
think
really
what
this
case
is
about
is
whether
it
is
reasonable
to
interpret
an
instruction
which
says
in
one
place
you
may
take
into
account
all
mitigating
circumstances,
and
in
another
place
that
you
will
not
be
swayed
by
sympathy...
whether
it's
reasonable
to
interpret
the
sympathy
portion
as
contradicting
what
is
said
in
the
other
portion...
or,
rather,
whether
a
reasonable
juror
would
say,
well,
mitigating
circumstances
are
one
thing
and
sympathy
is
something
quite
different
from
specific
factors
that
justify
being
merciful.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a
reasonable
juror
would
interpret
in
the
latter
fashion
and
would
believe
that
the
individual's
difficult
youth
is
a
mitigating
factor
and
not
something
that's
just
mere
sympathy.
why
wouldn't
a
juror
interpret
it
that
way?
why
would
a
juror
interpret
the
two
to
contradict
each
other?
the
court
clearly
says
at
one
point,
you
may
take
into
account
all
mitigating
circumstances.
why
would
a
juror
think,
well,
when
he
says
i
can't
take
into
account
sympathy,
that
means
some
mitigating
circumstances
i
can't
take
into
account?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
judge
said
this.
now,
he
listed
certain
mitigating
circumstances
that
existed
in
this
case,
but
he
said
you're
not
limited
in
your
consideration
to
the
minimum
mitigating
circumstances
set
out
and
you
may
consider
any
other
or
additional
mitigating
circumstances,
if
any,
that
you
may
find
from
the
evidence
to
exist
in
this
case.
what
facts
or
evidence
that
may
constitute
an
additional
mitigating
circumstance
is
for
the
jury
to
determine.
now,
i
think
a
reasonable
jury
would
say
that
means
i
need
a
fact
or
circumstance
to
be...
i
need
a
fact
or
evidence
to
establish
a
mitigating
circumstance.
and
that's
up
to
me
to
determine.
but
once
i
find
fact
or
evidence,
then
it's
a
mitigating
circumstance
if
i
want
it
to
be.
on
the
other
hand,
i
can't
use
mere
sympathy.
that
means
i
can't
just
feel
sorry
for
the
guy
on
the
basis
of
no
facts
or
evidence.
why
isn't
that
the
only
sensible
reconciliation
of
the
two
provisions?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that's
a
reasonable
interpretation,
ms.
berger?
you
think
that
a
juror
would
think
if
any
mitigating
evidence
produces
sympathy
in
me,
well,
then
i
can't...
then
i
can't
consider
it?
do
you
think
a
juror
would
really
think
that
that's
what
the
judge
was
saying?
you
can
consider
all
mitigating
circumstances
unless
they
produce
sympathy
in
you,
in
which
case
you
can't
consider
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
people
don't
understand
the
difference
between
he
doesn't
deserve
it
and
i
feel
sorry
for
him?
it
seems
to
me
the
two
are
quite
different.
mitigating
evidence
means
he
doesn't
deserve
it;
there
is
some
reason
why
he
doesn't
deserve
this
penalty.
sympathy
means
i
feel
sorry
for
him.
you
may
think
he
entirely
deserves
it
and
still
feel
sorry
for
him
knowing
that
this
person
before
you
fully
deserves
the
maximum
penalty,
he's
a
horrible
person,
but
you
can
see
him
confronting
that
fate
and
say,
gee,
i
feel
sorry
for
him.
i
don't
see...
i
don't
see
the
equation
you're
trying
to
insist
exists
between
whether
there
is...
the
defendant
is
morally
worthy
of
the
sentence
imposed
and
whether
you
feel
sorry
for
the
defendant.
