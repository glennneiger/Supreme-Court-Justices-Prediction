william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
88-1264,
james
saffle
versus
robin
leroy
parks.
mr.
nance,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
california
against
brown
surely
said
that
an
instruction
talking
about
mere
sympathy
was
perfectly
permissible,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nance.
ms.
berger,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
berger,
if
california
versus
brown
was
rightly
decided,
as
we
have
to
assume
it
was,
that
the
trial
court
instructing
a
jury
to
disregard
mere
sympathy
is
consistent
with
the
eighth
amendment,
and
if
we
were
to
affirm
this
judgment
here
of
the
tenth
circuit
that
a
trial
court
instructing
a
jury
to
disregard
the
influence
of
sympathy,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
or
other
arbitrary
factor
is
upheld,
you're
really...
i
would
think
a
trial
court
would
be
at
sea
as
to
know.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
virtually
nothing
to
distinguish...
and
i
find
much
to
make
of
judge
anderson's
dissent
in
the
tenth
circuit...
that
it's
almost
impossible
to
distinguish
on
the
merits
an
instruction
that
says
you
must...
you
may
not
pay
attention
to
mere
sympathy,
and
an
instruction
that
says
you
must
avoid
the
influence
of
sympathy
or
other
arbitrary
factors.
well,
what
is
that
distinction?
i
mean,
are
we
just
going
to
write
a
code
of
instructions
like
state
courts
do,
that
have
to
be
given
in
capital
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
don't
speak
with
special
authority
on
that
subject.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
don't
know
that
you
need
read
the
instruction
that
way.
you
could
say
it
says
don't
consider
sympathy
when
it's
an
arbitrary
factor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
to
be
useful--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but
that
assumes
the
point
in
issue
really.
are
we
to
say
that
if
a
plausible
reading
can
be
given
to
an
instruction
that
might
allow
it
to
be
considered
error
we
must
assume
the
jury
followed
that
even
though
there
is
an
equally
plausible
reading
that
would
not
have
been
constitutional
error?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
the
other
instructions
that
the
trial
court
gave?
we
have
a
rule,
among
many
other
rules,
you
know,
that
you
consider
the
instructions
as
a
whole
and
you
don't
single
out
one
from
the
others.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
ms.
berger.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nance,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
ten
minutes
remaining?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
