your
office
raise
the
justiciability
question
in
its
petition
for
certiorari?
justice
harry
a.

but
then
you
don't
think
much
of
it,
i
take
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
general
bryson,
i
suppose
we
don't
have
to
get
to
this
issue
if
you
prevail
on
the
other
one,
whether
it's
a
bill
for
raising
revenue.
