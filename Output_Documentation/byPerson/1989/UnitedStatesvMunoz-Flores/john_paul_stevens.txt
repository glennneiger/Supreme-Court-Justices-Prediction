justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
bryson,
are
you...
are
you
relying
on
the...
when
you
cite
us
to
the
second
paragraph
of
section
7
of
the
express
language
that
if
a
bill
passes
both
houses
and
is
signed
by
the
president,
even
after
a
veto,
it
shall
become
law?
that's
a
little
different
than
the
provision
in
the
executive
veto
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
couldn't
one
argue
that
the
entire
section
7
has
been
satisfied
if
the
second
paragraph
has
been
satisfied?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
one
couldn't
argue
in
the
executive
veto
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
would
say
it
originated
in
the
house
if
the
converse
happened,
wouldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
test
is
heads
i
win,
tails
you
lose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
perhaps
a
stupid
question?
when
in
your
view
did
this
piece
of
legislation
first
earn
the
title
of
being
a
bill
for
raising
revenue?
at
what
stage
in
the
legislative
process
did
it
become
a
bill?
was
there
a
bill
for
raising
revenue
that
was
later
enacted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
do
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mean
by
always
because
you
have
got
both
senate
and
house
and...
at
what
point
in
time
would
you
say
this
bill
originated,
the
bill
for
raising
revenue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
when
the
two...
when
the
two
pieces
previously
passed
by
the
house
were
stapled
together
as
your
opponent
described.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
whenever
that
happened--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
then...
and
the
senate
gave
it
a
new
number
at
that
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
be
sure...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
haven't
lost
your
answer.
i
don't
mean
to
interrupt,
but
you're
saying
when
the
senate
passed
the
amended
version
of
h.j.
648,
that
was
when
it
was
first
a
bill
for
raising
revenue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
it
originated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
there's...
there's
a
textual
problem
with
that
because
it
couldn't
be
in
the
language
of
section
7
a
bill
for
raising
revenue
unless
it
originated
in
the
house.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that's
what
the
constitution
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
requirements
for
it
to
be
a
bill
for
raising
revenue
is
that
it
must
have
originated
in
the
house.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
can
be
a
bill
even
though
it
did
not...
it
can
be
a
bill...
well,
i
understand
what
you're
saying
but
i'm
not
sure
it
squares
with
the
text.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--ergo
something
that
doesn't
originate
in
the
house
is
not
a
bill
for
raising
revenue.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
your
argument
then
would
be...
let
me...
let
me
trade
places
with
you
for
a
minute--
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
argument
then
would
be
that
when
it
became
a
bill
for
raising
revenue...
when
it
first
passed
the
house
and
it
never
subsequently
passed
the
senate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i'm
saying
when
it
went
to
the
house...
the
house
later
passed
it
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
that's
the
first
time
it
became
a
bill
for
raising
revenue,
did
the
senate
pass
it
a
second
time--
