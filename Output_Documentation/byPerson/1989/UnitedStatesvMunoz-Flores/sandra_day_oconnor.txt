justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
your
position
then
that
if
the
government
decided
we
needed
a
new
national
network
of
roads
or
needed
to
massively
expend
money
to
repair
those
we
have
and
enacted
an
income
tax
increase
for
that
purpose
and
put
the
money
in
the
general
revenue
with
the
idea
that
it
wanted
to
support
the
road
building,
no
origination
clause
problem
if
the
bill
originates
in
the
senate.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
a
pretty
extreme
position.
i'm
not
sure
you
have
to
reiterate
that
kind
of
doctrine
to
resolve
this
case.
