mr.
william
c.
bryson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
federal
special
assessment
statute
must
be
struck
down
on
the
ground
that
it
is
contrary
to
the
origination
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
there
are
two
subsidiary
questions
here.
first,
whether
questions
regarding
inconsistency
of
the
federal
statute
with
the
origination
clause
present
nonjusticiable
political
questions.
and
second,
assuming
that
the
question
is
justiciable,
whether
in
fact
there
was
a
violation
of
the
origination
clause
in
this
case.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
not
directly,
your
honor.
we
argued--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
your
honor,
we
felt
that
the
issue
on
which
there
was
a
conflict
among
the
lower
courts
at
the
time
we
filed
the
petition
and
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
at
the
time
we...
this
court
addressed
the
petition,
was
the...
on
the
merits.
there
was
no
conflict
on
the
justiciability
question.
now,
we
did
advert
in
the
petition
to
the
issue
of
justiciability
suggesting
that
at
minimum
the
question
of...
on
the
merits
should
be
addressed
with
an
eye
towards
the
problems
with
justiciability
and,
therefore,
that
the
merits
should
be
viewed
with...
by
extending
great
discretion
to
the...
to
the
house
in
deciding
whether
an
origination
clause
violation
had
occurred.
but,
no,
we
didn't
directly
raise...
raise
the
point.
we...
we
do
think,
however,
that
the
point
does
have
merit.
and
since
the
court
has
directed
the
parties
to
address
the
question,
we...
we
have
done
so
and
we
believe
that...
that
would
be
a
perfectly
legitimate
ground
for
a
decision
in
this
case.
and...
at...
at
bottom
what...
what
this
issue
presents,
the
whole
political
question
doctrine
is
summed
up,
i
think,
well
in
a
quote
from
coleman
against
miller
which
was
reiterated
in
baker
against
carr.
and
that
is
it
deals
with
the
appropriateness
of
attributing
finality
to
the
action
of
the
political
departments.
there
are
a
lot
of
different
kinds
of
political
questions,
as
the
court
discussed
in
baker
against
carr.
there
are
political
questions
in
which
there
is
a
textual
commitment
of
the
issue
to
one
branch.
there
are
cases
in
which
there
are
strong
prudential
reasons
for
the
court's
not
becoming
involved
in
a
particular
question.
issues
involving
foreign
affairs
figure
prominently
in
that
list.
this
case
is
a
somewhat
different
case.
it
doesn't...
there
is
no
direct
textual
commitment
in
the
constitution
of
this
issue
to
the
legislature.
but
we
believe
that
when
you
look
at
all
the
factors
bearing
on
the
question
of
justiciability
of
origination
clause
questions,
that
you
conclude
that
indeed
it
is
not
appropriate
for
the
court
to
interfere
with
the
judgment
that
was
made
by
the
house
and
by
the
legislature
as
a
whole
that
there
was
not
origination
clause
problem
in
this
case.
this
is
as
alexander
hamilton--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
our
position
is
that
with
respect
to
the
origination
clause
challenges,
that
they
are
subject
to
political
question
doctrine
across
the
board.
now,
one
could
say,
and
this
is
a
backup
argument
that
we
make,
that
certain
kinds
of
origination
clause
questions
are
simply
not
for
this
court
to
second-guess
the
house
on.
and
only
if
there
is
a
very
clear
obvious
original
clause
violation
should
the
court
interfere.
that
would
be
somewhat
analogous
to
the
position
the
court
has
taken
in
cases
involving
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
person
is
a
member
of
an
indian
tribe
or
recognizing
an
indian
tribe,
an
area
that
was
discussed
in
baker
against
carr.
but
our
initial
position
is
that
origination
clause
questions
as
a
whole
are
nonjusticiable.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
exactly.
and
that...
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
exactly
right.
or
if
in...
in
any
event,
if
any
court
where
so
asked,
they
would
quickly
dismiss
the
complaint.
the...
the
statute
will
not
come
up
for
review
unless
the
house
is
happy
and
the
senate
is
happy--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--with
the
procedure
and
with
the
substance.
and--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--and
the
president
is
too,
exactly.
the
house...
i
think
alexander
hamilton
put
this
well
when
he
said
in
the
federalist
that
the
origination
clause
question
is
essentially
the
exclusive
privilege
of
originating
money
bills
which
belongs
to
the
house
of
representatives.
if
the
house
of
representatives
is
satisfied
that
the
origination
clause
privilege
has
not
been
violated,
then
it
can
pass
the
bill
that
is
sent
to
it
by
the
senate
and
the
president
can
sign
it
and
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
that
should
be,
we
think,
the
end
of
the
matter
with
respect
to
questions
of
court
review
of
that
statute.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
we
wouldn't...
you
wouldn't.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
because
the
house
is
not
really,
we
think,
giving
away
a
power
here.
what's
really...
this
is
not
an
intra
inter-branch
dispute
over
the
creation
of
an
animal
that
the
constitution
doesn't
recognize.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
your
honor,
we...
we
think
it
is
not.
we
think
it
is...
is
a
matter
of
sequence
not
a
matter
of
the
creation
of
a
non-constitutional
animal.
what
happened
in
the
legislative
veto
cases
was
that
we
had
something
that
purported
to
be
legislation
which
simply
wasn't
because
it
was
simply
the
views
of
the
house
of
representatives,
not
concurred
in
by
the
senate
and
not
presented
and
concurred
to...
and
concurred
in
by
the
president.
in
this
case,
all
that's
involved
is
a
matter
of
sequence
in
which
a
bill,
which
is
clearly
a
bill,
arguably
did
not
originate
in
the
house--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
think
you
give
full
effect,
your
honor,
by
allowing
the
house
to
decide
whether
there
has
been
an
origination
clause
violation.
i'm
not
suggesting--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--you
don't
and
i
think
the
difference
is
because
in
the
legislative
veto
case
you...
you're
talking
about
the
presentation
to
the
court
of
something
that
simply
is
not
a
statute.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
something
arrives
to
the
court
and
which
you
can
fairly
say
this
is
not
a
statute.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
let--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i...
i
would
disagree,
your
honor,
because...
to
take
the
next
clause
that
appears
in
the
constitution
after
the
origination
clause,
the
presentment
clause
requires
when
a
bill
is
sent
to
the
president,
that
if
the
president
decides
not
to
approve
the
bill,
he
sends
it
back
to
the
house
from
which
it
originated.
now,
suppose
that
he
sends
to
the
wrong
house
and
it
originated
in
the
house
and
he
sends
to
the
senate.
the
senate
then
acts
on
the
bill
and
overrides
the
veto
and
sends
it
to
house
and
the
house
then
overrides
the
veto.
it
cannot
be
the
case,
i
submit,
that
this
court
would
then
strike
down
the
statute
on
the
ground
that
it
was
sent
to
the
wrong
house.
it
becomes
simply
a
matter
of
sequence.
now,
one
could
argue
that
that
is
not
a
bill,
not
an
act,
because
the
provisions
set
up
in
the
constitution
were
violated.
but,
of
course,
that
can't
be
because
a
president
who
wanted
his
veto
sustained
would
obviously
always
send
it
to
the
wrong
house.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
not...
not
really.
i
think
it's
a
matter
of--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
constitutional
remedy.
it's
a
question
of--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that
certainly
is
support
for
the
position
that
we
are
taking
that...
that
once
the
house
is
satisfied
that
the
origination
clause
has
been
fulfilled,
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--one
certainly
could.
i
mean,
one
has
to
argue
to
the
contrary--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
that's
correct.
to
make
the
contrary
argument,
one
would
have
to
say
you
have
to
satisfy
each
and
every
clause
and
each
and
every
clause
has
to
be
fulfilled
with
respect...
and
that
anyone
could
come
in
and
enforce...
insist
on...
compliance
with
that
clause
and
that
noncompliance
results
in
the
invalidation
of
the
statute.
and
we
submit
that
both
the...
the
history
of
the
origination
clause
and
looking
at
the
second
clause
as
well
suggest
that
that
can't
be
the
case.
now,
the...
it's
important,
i
think,
in
focusing
on
the
question
of
justiciability
what
the
costs
and
benefits
are
of
striking
down
statutes
when
in
fact
both
the
house
and
senate,
and
indeed
the
president,
have
agreed
that
the
statute
is
valid
and
have
passed
it.
the
benefit
of
striking
down
a
statute
to
a
citizen
is
virtually
negligible.
the
house
could,
if
it
were
presented
with
a
bill
that
it
believed
came
from
the
senate
and
was
a
revenue
bill,
could
always
simply
put
a
house
number
on
the
top
of
it,
pass
it
and
send
it
back
to
the
senate.
where
there
is
an
origination
clause
violation
alleged,
all
that
has
happened
is
that
the
house
has
failed
to
do
that
ministerial
task.
probably,
and
in
most
cases,
because
the
house
has
failed
to
recognize
the
bill
as
a
origination
clause
problem.
it
has
failed
to--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--your
honor,--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--exactly.
they
do...
it
is
an
important
house
prerogative.
but
i
think
when
you...
when
you
say
that
what
you
are
saying
is
this
is
something
for
the
house
to
exercise.
it
demeans,
in
some
senses,
the
house's
prerogative
if
the
courts
are
sitting
behind
the
house
and
second-guessing
the
house.
it
is
the
very
importance
of
the
prerogative
for
the
house
to
enforce
that
in
part
cuts
against
judicial
review
after
the
house
has
decided
that
the
prerogative
is
not
applicable
in
a
particular
case.
and...
and
the
example
is,
i
think,
what
would
happen
in
a
case
like
this,
if
in
fact
the
court
started
actively
to
review
origination
clause
questions,
if
the
house
had
even
recognized
this
as
an
origination
clause
question,
and
it
seems
to
me
in
light
of
the
fact
that
this
didn't
look
like
what...
what
anyone
has
considered
revenue
bills
in
the
past,
it
would
be
perfectly
understandable
why
the
court
did
not...
why
the
house
did
not
recognize
this
as...
as
presenting
an
origination
clause
question.
but
suppose
it
had,
it
recognized
it
as
a
potential
problem
for
origination
clause,
instead
of
simply
deciding
finally
and
for
once
that
this
was
not
in
the
house's
view
an
origination
clause
problem,
they
would
have
had
to
go
through
the
exercise
of
taking
the
statute
that
had
been
presented
to
them
by
the
senate
and
putting
another
house
number
on
the
top
of
it
and
sending
it
back
to
the
senate
simply
to
ensure
that
that
statute
would
be
invulnerable
to
constitutional
attack
in
the
courts.
we
submit
that
that
really
demeans
the
house's
role
and
doesn't
enhance
it.
and
it
is
an
important
prerogative.
it's
one
which
the
house
has
guarded
jealously.
but
it's
also
guarded
it
very
well.
it's
important,
i
think,
to
point
out
that
in
two
hundred
years
there's
only
been
one
statute
which
has
ever
been
struck
down
on
origination
clause
grounds.
that
was
struck
down
by
a
district
court
and
the
opinion
in
that
case,
i
think,
is
manifestly
incorrect.
so
that
the
sum
total
of...
of
the
contribution
of
the
judiciary
in
this
area
over...
over
two
hundred
years
in
second-guessing
the
house,
to
the
extent
that
there
has
been
any
second
guessing,
has
been
one
incorrect
decision.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
that's
certainly
an
important
feature
of
our
argument.
that
what
you
are
dealing
with
is
not
an
inter-branch
conflict
when
you
are
dealing
with
something
that
does
not
create,
as
i
was
trying
to
make
the
point
with
justice
scalia...
an
animal
that
does
not
exist
in
the
constitution--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
certainly
true.
but
it
will
be
here
only
if
you
allow
an
individual
to
come
into
court
and
claim
that
in
spite
of
the
satisfaction
on
the
part
of
both
entities
of
the
house...
of
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--within--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
right.
that's
the
nature
of
the
animal
and
that's
what
we
have
here.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
would.
i
certainly
would.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think...
without
trying
to
give
a
global
answer
to
all
of
these
questions,
i
think
it
is
wise
to
look
at
the
language
that
the
court
used
in
baker
against
carr
when
the
court
said
that
it
is
necessary
to
make
a
discriminating
inquiry
into
the
precise
facts
and
postures...
posture
of
each
particular
case
and
the
impossibility
of
resolution
by
semantic
cataloguing.
i
think
one
of...
the
wisdom
of
that
point
may
be
presented
by
this
case
in
that
you
have
to
look
at
these
things
on
a
very
narrow...
on
a
very
narrow
basis.
you
can't
simply
make
sweeping
assertions
that
perhaps
by--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--the...
on
the
merits,
if
i
can
turn
to
the
merits
now.
the
first
question
presented
is
whether
the
bill
in
this
case
that's
at
issue
was
a
bill
for
raising
revenue
within
the
meaning
of
this
court's
precedence.
we
submit
that
if
you
look
at
the
nebeker
case...
that's
the
twin
city
bank
against
nebeker...
and
the
millard
case...
millard
against
roberts...
it
is
absolutely
clear
that
this
is
not
a
bill
for
raising
revenue
within
the
meaning
of
the
court's
precedence.
those
cases
establish
the
proposition
that
if
a
statute
sets
up
a
program
and
arranges
a
means
to
pay
for
that
program
within
the
statute,
that
the
means
to
pay
for
the
program
do
not
constitute
the
bill...
a
bill
for
raising
revenue
within
the
meaning
of
the
origination
clause
even
if
the
means
for
paying
for
the
program
turn
out
to
be
taxes
and
even
if
the
money
that's
assessed
goes
into
the
general
treasury.
this
was
certainly
the
case
in
the
nebeker
case,
the
twin
city
bank
against
nebeker,
where
the
congress
imposed
on
national
banking
associations
the
costs
of
setting
up
a
national
currency
system
in
which...
which
was,
as
the
court
explained
it,
to
benefit
all
the
people.
these
were,
as
described
by
the
court,
taxes
on
the
national
banking
association.
they
went
into
the
general
treasury.
but
they
were,
as
the
court
explained,
for
the
purpose
of
paying
for
the
program
which
the
congress
had
set
up.
this
case
follows
a
fortiori
from
that
one
because
in
this
case
these
were
not
denominated
taxes
and
the
payments
in
this
case
go
not
into
the
general
treasury
but
into
a
special
fund
for
victims.
now,
there
are
certain
limited
circumstances
in
which
these
funds
may
go
into
the
general
treasury.
but
they
are
only
in
the
rare
case.
and
the...
the
general
structure
of
the
statute
is
that
the
funds
that
are
collected
for
the
special
assessments
will
go
into
a
special
fund
for
victims.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
millard
case
is
almost...
almost
on
point
with
that.
in
millard
there
was
a
project
to
do
railroad
construction
in
the
district
of
columbia
which
the
congress
said,
here's
the
railroad
construction
project
and
we're
going
to
impose
a
property
tax
within
the
district
of
columbia
to
pay
for
it.
this
court
said
no
origination
clause
problem.
now,
i
think
in
that
case
the
house
might
very
well
argue
that
this
should
have
originated
in
the
house
and
would
very
possibly
reject
the
senate's
effort
to
originate
that
kind
of
legislation.
but
this
court's
precedence
would
suggest
that
if
the
decision
is
for
this
court
to
make,
this
court
would
say
no
origination
clause.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
you
don't
because
this
case,
i
think,
is
a
good
deal
easier
than
that
and
i
am
just
trying
to
lay
out
what
the
limits
of
the
court's
doctrine
had...
have
been.
and
i
think
in
part
what
the
court
is
doing
by
setting
the
limits
very
broadly
for
what
is
going
to
be
permitted
in
this
area...
what
the
court
is
doing
is
responding
in
part
to
the...
the
difficulty...
the...
the...
the
reluctance
to
interfere
with
the
resolution
by
the
house
and
senate
of
origination
clause
problems.
they
are,
in
a
sense,
deferring
very
broadly
without
actually
calling
the
question
a
political
question.
that
is
why,
i
think
you
get
decisions
like
nebeker
and
millard
against
roberts
which
say
that
as
long
as
you
have
a
program
which
is
being
paid
for
in
the
same
statute,
that's
it.
you
don't
have
to
inquire
any
further.
now,
the...
the
response--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--even
if
it
hits
everybody.
that's
right.
which
is
the
case
in
millard,
everybody
within
the
district
of
columbia.
there's
no
reason
to
distinguish
between
a
tax
on
everybody
in
the
district
of
columbia
than
a
tax
on
everybody
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
a
tax
on
everybody
in
the
country
for
purposes
of
analysis.
now,
the
respondents
argue
that
there
is
a
difference
between
this
case
and
some
of
the
other
supreme
court
cases
that
we
have
relied
on.
and
that
is,
they
say,
that
in
those
cases
there
was
a
quid
pro
quo,
the
person
who
was
paying
the
tax
was
getting
a
benefit.
first
of
all,
we
think
that's
not
so.
if
you
look
at
the
nebeker
case,
for
example,
there's
no
direct
benefit,
no
quid
pro
quo
for
the
national
banking
associations
that
were
picking
up
the
bill
for
the
creation
of
a
national
currency
system
that
was
to
benefit
everybody.
but,
in
any
event,
there's
a
more
basic
objection
to
that
point,
which
is
that
a...
there
is
no
logical
difference
between
a
tax
that
is
a...
or
a
fee
that
is
imposed
to...
for
which
one
pays
for
a
benefit
and
a
fee
that
one
pays
in
order
to
compensate
the
government
for
a
cost
that
one
has
imposed
on
the
government.
let
me
give
you
an
example
that
i
think
illustrates
this
point.
suppose
there
is
a
$100
fee
for
using
the
yellowstone
national
park
because
of
a
littering
problem
and
the
$100
fee
is
to
be
used
to
pick
up
the
litter.
it
can't
make
a
difference
in
the
constitutionality
of
that
statute
as
to
whether
it
is
deemed
to
be
a
fee
which
is
a
benefit
to
a
person
going
into
the
park
so
that
he
will
enjoy
the
park's
litter-free
aspect
versus
a
case
in
which
he
is
being
charged
a
fee
because
of
what
he
may
have
contributed,
or
members
of
his
class
may
have
contributed,
to
the
costs
of
picking
up
the
litter.
it's
the
same
thing.
it
is
just
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
in
this
case
you
have
a
class
of
people...
people
who
have
committed
crimes...
who,
as
a
class,
have
imposed
costs
on
others...
the
victims
of
crime...
and
congress
has
decided
to
impose
on
that
class,
the
people
who
have
committed
crimes,
the
costs,
or
some
of
the
costs
of
that
event,
which
have
been
suffered
by...
by
victims.
there
is
a
one-for-one,
quid
pro
quo
of
sorts...
a
negative
quid
pro
quo
that's
perfectly
consistent
with
the
respondent's
argument
except
that
isn't
a
so-called
benefit
to
the...
to
the
member
of
the
class
that's
paying
the
fee.
finally,
on
origination,
i
would
point
out
that
this
statute
passes
almost
any
test
you
could
possibly
imagine
for
origination.
the
house
was
the
first
chamber
to
propose
special
assessments
in
the
form
that
they
first
passed.
it
was
the
first
to
pass
the
precise
language
that
finds
its...
that
found
its
way
into
the
special
assessments
act.
it
was...
the
house
introduced
the
bill
in
which
that
language
was
ultimately
found.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
don't
think
so.
our
position,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
any
number
of
different
ways
that
a
bill
can
be
deemed
to
have
originated
in
the
house.
the
fact
that
there
are...
there
are...
that
the
senate
may
have
thought
of
the
bill
first,
doesn't
foreclose
the
house
from
considering
that
it
has
originated
the
bill
if
it
first
passes--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
sounds...
it
sounds
odd,
but
i
think
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
the
answer.
because
otherwise--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i...
not
necessarily,
your
honor.
but...
because
in
this
case
i
think
there
are
any
number
of
different
tests
which
are
perfectly
presentable,
all
of
which
come
out
the
same
way,
as
house
originated.
now,
the
only
test
that
points
in
the
direction
of
senate
origination
is
one
which
we
think
is
an
invalid
test
and
that
is
the
argument
that
respondent
makes
that
it
is
the
house
that
first
puts
the
final
language
into
the
package
that
has
the
number
that
finally
passes.
the
only
thing
the
senate
did
in
this
case
with
respect
to
the
victim
protection
act,
was
to
take
a
house
bill
that
had
that
act
in
it
and
had
been
passed
by
the
house,
and
stick
it
on
to
another
house
bill
which
did
not
have
that
language
into
it
and
then
pass
it
and
send
it
back
to
the
house.
the
only
thing
the
senate
contributed
to
this
case,
and
it
says,
was
a
staple,
stapling
the
two
bills
together.
and
yet
this
is
deemed
to
be
dispositive
in
favor
of
saying
it
was
senate
originated.
that
can't
be.
if
the
house...
if
the
senate
had
taken
the
two
bills
and
turned
them
upside
down
so
that
the
bill
that
had
the
victim
act
in
it
had...
that
bill's
number
was
the
bill
number
that
passed,
then
even
respondent
would
say
this
originated
in
the
house.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
yes,
we
would.
because
we
say
that
any
number
of
different
ways
that...
of
conceiving
origination
will
satisfy
the
origination
clause.
they
aren't
necessarily--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
is...
that...
it
is
a
heads
we
win,
tails
we
lose
because
of
the
difference--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--because...
because
otherwise
you
get
into
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no.
otherwise
the
house
loses,
your
honor.
[laughter]
otherwise
the
house
loses.
i
think
the
house
is
deprived
of
its
right
to
make
a
determination
that
this
is
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
origination
interests.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
thank
you.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
thank
you.
briefly,
on
the
question
of
nebeker
and
whether
this
was
a
voluntary
contribution
as
it
was
characterized,
i
think,
by
the
respondent.
sure,
the
national
banks
associations
could
have
stop
being
national
banking
associations
and
wouldn't
have
had
to
pay
the
tax
that
was
imposed
on
them.
but
i
could
avoid
the
income
tax
by
quitting
my
job.
the
fact
is
that
as
long
as
they
wanted
to
remain
in
the
national
bank
system,
they
were
required
to
pay
the
tax
for
a
benefit
which
the
court
specifically
described
as
being
for
all
the
people.
so
this
isn't
a
quid
pro
quo.
and
in
any
event,
this
case
satisfies
the
test...
the
very
test
that
respondent
argues
for
which
is,
and
i
think
i
am
quoting...
"a
direct
relationship
between
the
person
paying
and
the
person
receiving.
"
the
person
paying
here
is
the
person
who
is
engaged
in
crime.
the
person
receiving
is
a
person
who
is
a
victim
of
crime.
this
was
very
specifically
acknowledged
by
congress
to
be
a
direct
relationship
between
the
person
who
caused
the
injury
and
the
person
who
suffered
the
injury.
so
it
does
satisfy
the
quid
pro
quo.
it's
a
negative
quid
pro
quo.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
no,
because
the
government
is
acting
as
a
stakeholder
for
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
it
is--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--it
was
deemed
to
be
the
common
good
to
benefit
this
particular
class
of
individuals.
it
was
the
class
that
was
unknowable
in
advance.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
but
proximately,
we
submit
that...
that
it
didn't
benefit
the
banks.
the
banks
happened
to
achieve
a
general
benefit
of
being
able
to
participate
in
a
more
efficient
system.
but
it
was
not
a
case
in
which
they
were
getting
something
for
which
they
were
paying
and
getting
full
value
for
what
they
were
paying.
they
were
supporting
a
system
that
was
a
nationwide
currency
system
that
was
having
some
marginal
benefit
to
them
no
doubt.
but
basically
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
benefitting
all
the
people.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
it
is
in
a
sense
using
the
courts
to
aid
victims
in
that
the
courts
are
one
of
the
agencies
that
collects
the
money
that
ultimately
goes
to
the
victim.
but
it
is
congress
that
has
set
up
a
system
under
which
the
victims
are
to
be
the
beneficiaries
and
the
defendants
are
to
be
the
people
who
are
supporting,
in
part,
this
program.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
not
good
use
of
the
courts.
it
is
a
fee
imposed
on
people
who
impose
costs
on
others
just
as
in
my
example,
the
fee
charged
to
people
who
use
the
national
park
in
order
to
clean
up
the
litter
that
they
have
left.
the
sunset
provisions
of
the
act
were
designed,
as
the
legislative
history
makes
clear,
not
to
allow
all
this
money
to
go
into
the
treasury
at
the
end
of
x
period
of
time,
but
to
enforce...
to
force
congress
to
reconsider
the
statute.
