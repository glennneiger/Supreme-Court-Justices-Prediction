ms.
judy
clare
clarke
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
basic
theme
of
the
government's
brief
and
the
government's
argument
really
is
who
cares.
munoz
pays
an
assessment
and
he
complains
about
the
constitutionality
of
the
assessment
simply
because
of
the
sequence
in
which
the
bill
passed
the
congress.
who
cares
other
than
the
house
of
representatives
about
the
sequence
of
bills.
and
in
this
case,
who
cares
because
in
fact
the
language
of
the
house
was
passed
by
the
senate
and
sent
back
to
the
house.
so
the
bottom
line
question
is
why
are
we
here
and
who
cares.
and
in
reality,
what
the
government's
argument
does
is
overlook
the
significance
of
the
origination
clause.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
the
framers
did
not
see
it
as
a
matter
of
parliamentary
procedure.
they
did
not
see
it
as
simply
a
matter
of
sequence.
they
saw
it
as
something
that
deserved
the
merit
of
going
into
the
constitution.
they
brought
it
basically
from
england
where
it
was
a
matter
of
practice
that
the
most
democratic
house
controlled
the
purse
strings.
in
fact,
in
the
states
in
this
country
at
the
time
of
the
constitutional
convention,
it
was
a
matter
of
practice
in
the
states.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
it
lost
some
strength
in
the
compromise.
there's
no
question.
and
the
people...
the
framers
who
were
very
supportive
of
the
origination
clause
were
very
angry
about
that
and
in
fact
did
not
sign
off
on
the
constitution,
in
part,
because
of
their
dissatisfaction
with
the
watering
down
of
what
they
viewed
as
this
very
most
important
clause.
but
the
fact
remains
is
that
it
did
remain
in
the
constitution.
it
was
part
of
the
great
compromise
of
the
framers
in
the
debate
between
the
small
and
the
large
states,
the
power
between
those
states.
the
small
states
wanted
an
equal
vote
in
the
senate
and
the
large
states
said,
well,
we
want
the
power
to
originate
money
bills,
to
originate
revenue
bills,
because
we
are
representative
of
the
people.
now
the
government
has
suggested
in
the
briefing
that
popular
elections
of
the
senators
has
decreased
again,
watered
down
even
further
the
origination
clause,
when
in
reality
it
has
not.
the
house
remains
the
most
democratic
body.
it's
elected
and
unelected,
if
it
were,
every
two
years.
the
people
of
the
united
states
can
boot
out
the
entire
house
every
two
years
if
they
are
dissatisfied
with
the
way
the...
they're
being
taxed,
with
the
way
the
government
is
operating,
with
the
size
of
the
government.
the
senate,
the
people
tend
to
forget,
it's
a
six-year
turnaround
and
we
cannot
as
easily
get
rid
of
those
senators.
the
senate,
the
same
two
senators
from
nevada
have
an
equal
vote
as
the
same
two
senators
from
california.
the
california
senators
represent
probably
eleven
or
twelve
or
fifteen
million
people.
whereas,
the
senators
from
nevada
represent
what
350,000
to
500,000
people.
so
the
fact
of
popular
elections
has
not
diminished
the
clause
at
all.
it
was
the
power--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--i
would
object
to
that.
i...
i
think
that
before
getting
into
a
detailed
discussion
of
that,
we'd
have
to
look
at
the
significance
the
framers
gave
to
it.
however,
under
the
precedence
of
this
court,
i
think
that
the
enrolled
bill
doctrine
may
operate
to
stop
consideration
of
what
went
into
the
bill
and
how
many
people
were
there
at
the
time
that
it
was
voted.
there
is
some...
some
degree
of
a
presumption
of...
of...
of
appropriateness
when
a
bill
comes
out
of
the
congress.
i
think
for
the
origination
clause
you
would
have
to
look
at...
you
would
have
to
be
able
to
look
at
the
amendment
of
the
senate
in
order
to
give
the
clause
any
strength.
but
yes,
i
believe
that
a
litigant
could
come
before
this
court
and
say
there
was
not
a
quorum
present
at
the
time
the
bill
was
voted
on
and,
therefore,
the
bill
is
not
valid
if
the
court
changed--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--the
history
of
its
precedence.
but
to
this
point,
the
court
has
said
you
don't
really
look
behind
the
bill.
in
those
kinds
of
circumstances,
you
assume
that
the
seal
of
the
clerk
counted
the
adequate
number
of
yeas
and
nays
and
that
the--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--because
you
destroy
the
clause.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
well...
and,
again,
i
say
before
we
could
get
into
the
meat
of
that
clause,
we
would
have
to
look
at
the
significance
of
the
clause.
if
in
fact,
the
quorum
clause--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--well,
as
i
say,
i
believe
that
a
litigant
could
come
before
this
court
and
say
there
was
not
a
quorum,
the
bill
was
invalid.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
i
think
both
of
us
have
to
say
probably
several
things.
[laughter]
the
who
cares
argument
really
wraps
very
easily
and
very
appropriately
into
the
political
question
issue.
and
the
government
acknowledges,
i
think,
as
it
has
to,
that
this
court
has...
has
addressed
the
clause
four
times,
that
there
is
no
textual
commitment,
and
that
in
reality
by
finding
a
political
question
here,
the
court
would
be
writing
itself
out
of
separation
of
powers
litigation
completely.
as
has
been
pointed
out
this
morning,
the
president
gave
up
the
presentment
right
in
chadha
when
he
signed
the
immigration
and
nationality
act.
the
president
gave
up
the
appointment
right
in
buckley
v.
valeo
when...
when
the
president
signed
the
federal
election
campaign
act.
and
if
the
court
decides
that
the
house
gave
up
the
prerogative
of
origination
when
it
passed
the
bill,
then
the
court
in
reality
would
be
writing
itself
out
of
political...
out
of
separation
of
powers
cases.
and
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
dangerous
step
for
the
court
and...
and
one
that
is
not
necessary
at
all.
the
government's
position
is
that
in
reality
the
court
would
be
showing
a
lack
of
respect
for
the
house.
not
at
all.
any
time
the
court
strikes
a
statute
as
unconstitutional,
that's,
i
suppose,
a
lack
of
respect
for
the
house
and
the
senate
because
they've
passed
the
bill
in
fact.
the
house
has
never
assumed
that
it
has
the
sole
power
over
the...
enforcing
the
origination
clause.
and
in
fact
in
the
briefs...
throughout
the
briefs
there's
a
debate
throughout
the
history
of
the
house
and
senate
about
what
the
court
would
say
and
what
the
court
would
do
and
that
the
court
has
the
final
control
over
constitutionality.
that
the
court...
that
the
house
has
the
ability
to
enforce
the
origination
clause
is
really
irrelevant.
the
house
has
the
ability
not
to
pass
unconstitutional
laws.
the
house
has
the
ability
and,
in
fact,
has
the
constitutional
obligation
to
enforce
the
constitution
and
to
act
in
a
manner
that
it
believes
is
constitutionally
appropriate.
the
significant
thing
here
that
distinguishes
this
case
is
that
the
house
simply
didn't
discuss
it.
the
court
may
be
in
a
little
bit
more
different
situation
or
in
a
deferential
situation
perhaps,
if
in
fact
the
house
had
debated
the
clause
or
the
applicability
of
the
clause.
but
you
don't
have
that
here.
the
government
argues
that
there
are
a
lack
of
judicially
manageable
standards.
its
definitions,
its
legislative
history,
its...
the
circuits
have
addressed
the
origination
clause
most
recently
really
in
the
tefra
litigation,
the
tax
equity
and
fiscal
responsibility
act.
the
states
routinely
address
their
own
origination
clauses
and,
in
fact,
this
court
has...
has
addressed
the
clause.
to
the
merits.
is
this
a
bill
for
raising
revenue?
i,
of
course--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--well,
the--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--i
don't
know
that
there
has
been
any
clear
view
except
for
the
fact
that
the
house...
members
of
the
house
have
debated
what
the
court
would
do
with
this
piece
of
litigation
if
they
don't
take
care
of
the
origination
problem
themselves.
i
know
in
the
district
of
columbia
case--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--yes.
there's
been
great
discussion
of
the
nebeker
and
norton
and
miller
cases
in
the
debates
of
the
congress
over
the...
over
the
clause.
and,
in
fact
members
of
the
house
attempted
to
bring
a
lawsuit
in
the
district
of
columbia
over
tefra,
to
stop
the
tefra
bill
from...
from
passing
out
of...
out
of
a
concern
that
it
was
violating
the
origination
clause.
so
there
has
been
some
concern
of
the
house
and
an
acknowledgment
that
the
court
is
actively
involved.
but,
to
the
merits.
is
it
a
bill
for
raising
revenue?
we
agree,
as
would
be
expected,
with
the
ninth
circuit's
position
on
that.
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
the
assessments
provision
that
says
what
it
is
except
that
it
stands
alone
as
a
part
of
title
18,
not
within
the
penalty
provisions
of
title
18
but
it
stands
alone
as
a
mandatory
assessment
provision.
if
you
look
to
the
legislative
history,
the
legislative
history
says
basically
that
it
will
generate
needed
income
to
offset
the
cost
of
the
victim's
fund
and
will
constitute
new
income
for
the
federal
government.
there
is
a
cap
on
the
size
of
the
fund.
now,
congress
has
raised
that
cap
since
1984
from,
i
think
it
started
at
$100
million
and
now
it
is
up
to
$150
million.
and
there
is
an
end
to
the
life
of
that
fund.
originally
1988
was
to
end
the
fund.
now
1994
is
to
end
the
fund.
so
there
is
a
time
where
the
monies
going
into
that
fund
will
stop
going
into
that
fund
and
will
go
into
the
general
treasury.
in...
in
fact
in
fiscal
year
1986,
a
report
of
the
attorney
general
indicates
that
out
of
a
concern
over
the
budget
deficit,
$3.2
million
of
that
assessment
money
was
held...
or,
of
the
fund
money
was
held
from
the
fund
to
assist
with
deficit
problems.
so,
we
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
that
in
fact
the
bill
was
one
for
raising
revenue.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
with
the
national
banking
act.
nebeker
and
norton
and
roberts,
the
three
cases
really
to
deal
more
directly
with
the
issue,
were
situations
where
you
pay
and
you
get.
there
is
a
direct
relationship
between
the
person
paying
the
tax
and
the
person
receiving
the
benefit
in
nebeker,
the
national
banking
act.
those
banks
that
chose
to
become
part
of
the
national
currency
system
paid
the
fee
and
they
got
the
direct
benefit
in
return.
the
same
thing
happened
in...
in
norton
with
the
postal
money
order
system.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
an
ability
to
become...
to
participate
in
the...
in
the
currency
system
and
to
have
their
currency
freely
traded
among
all
of
the
banks.
the
banks
could
choose
not
to
go
into
the
national...
become
part
of
the
national
banking
act.
they
could
choose
not
to
pay
that
fee
and
not
to
participate
in
the
system.
but
the...
the
act
was
really
set
up
to
encourage
the
banks
to
become
part
of
this
system
because
they
would
in
the
long
run
stand
to
make
money
and
to
do
better
if
they
participated
in
the
system.
but
they
paid
and
they
got.
in
norton,
the
postal
money
order
system,
you
pay,
you
get.
you
pay
for
the
postal
money
orders,
you
get
the
benefit
of
using
the
postal
money
orders.
there
was
a
direct
relationship.
now
i
agree
the
that
the
court
has
never
really
in
those
three
cases
discussed
the
fact
of
the
direct
relationship.
but
i
think
a
reading
of
those
three
cases
compels
the
conclusion
that
it's
a
pay
as
you
go.
i
pay.
i
get.
and
in
this
case
the
incidental
revenue
test
simply
doesn't
work
unless
it's
a
you
pay,
you
get.
because
in
reality,
the
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked,
could
happen.
the
senate
could
originate
special
purpose
legislation,
identify
a
class
of
people
to
be
taxed,
identify
a
purpose
and
avoid
the
origination
requirement.
we
could
write
the
origination
clause
out
of
the
constitution,
if
the
incidental
revenue
test
is
read
in
any
manner
other
than
to
compel
a
direct
relationship
between
the
person
paying
and
the
person
receiving.
the
government,
in
order
to
defeat
the
revenue
raising
argument,
has
also
argued
that
the
clause...
that
the
assessment
provision
is
in
reality
a
penalty,
a
criminal
sanction
and
they
point
really
to
two...
two
identifiable
things.
one,
the
assessment
is
a
consequence
of
a
criminal
conviction.
yes,
it
is.
two,
the
amount
of
the
assessment
differs
between
a
felony
and
a
misdemeanor.
yes,
it
does.
but
that
is
where
the
similarity
with
penalties
stops
entirely.
it
is
not
in
the
sentencing
provisions
of
title
18.
it
is
not
identified
in
the
statute
in
title
18
that
identifies
sentencing
options...
probation,
fine,
imprisonment,
notice
to
victims,
forfeiture
and
restitution.
it
is
not
one
of
the
identified
sentencing
options.
it
is
not
in
any
way
connected
to
the
defendant.
it
is
not
in
any
way
connected
to
the
harm
caused
by
the
defendant
which
traditional
sentencing,
even
under
the
sentencing
reform
act,
is
connected...
the
harm
is
connected
to
the...
to
the
penalty.
it
is
not
like
a
fine
except
in
the
manner
in
which
it's
collected,
because
in
imposing
a
fine
the
court
is
statutorily
mandated
to
consider
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
pay,
the
burdens
on
the
defendant's
family
should
he
or
she
have
to
pay
a
fine,
the
amount
of
the
illegal
gain
to
the
defendant.
there
are
statutorily
defined
considerations
in
imposing
a
fine.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
i'm
sorry.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
to
my
knowledge,
there
are
no
statute
that...
that
require
a
minimum
payment
of
a
fine.
i
think
they
would
run
into
severe
equal
protection
problems
and
i
think
that
probably
is
why
the
statutes
don't.
now,
there
are
statutes
that
require
a
minimum
in
term
of
imprisonment
minimum...
a
minimum
and
then
there's
a
maximum
range.
but
to
my
knowledge,
there
are
no
criminal
statutes
that
require
the
minimum
imposition
of
a
fine.
now,
the
sentencing
guidelines
superimpose
on
top
of
the...
of
the
criminal
code.
but
the
guidelines
also
themselves
say
look
to
the
ability
of
the
defendant
to
pay
and
do
not
impose
a
fine
unless
the
court
finds
that
the
defendant
has
the
ability
to
pay.
so
it's
a
different
situation.
also
in
the...
in
the
failure
to
pay
a
fine.
that
can
be
a
revocation
of
probation.
you
can
be
resentenced
for
failing
to
pay
a
fine
and
you
can
be
prosecuted
for
the
willful
failure
to
pay
a
fine.
these
assessments
are
treated
completely
differently.
they
are
simply
collected
bureaucratically
in
the
same
way
that...
that
a
fine
is
collected.
the
argument
that
the
government
makes
today
on
where
did
the
bill
originate,
when
you
get
right
down
to
it,
what
the
government
seeks
to
do
is
to
have...
is
to
shield
from
scrutiny
a
senate
amendment
of
a
house
bill.
the
government
in
reality
says
the
house
passed
a
bill
648,
the
joint
resolution,
and
the
house
passed
5690
and
the
house
sent
648
over
to
the
senate
and
then
the
house
sends
5690
over
to
the
senate
and
by
means
of
a
staple,
the
senate
packs
the
two
together
and
sends
them
back
to
the
house.
that's
not
what
happened.
648
passes,
5690...
we
need
to
look
at
what
648
was.
it
was
the
continuing
appropriations
for
fiscal
year
1985,
it
was
us
running
the
government
basically.
and
the
house
tacked
onto
that
the
senate
crime
bill,
s.
1762,
that
the
senate
had
passed
in
february,
this
is
september.
so
the
house
chose
to
take
the
senate
crime
bill
together
with
the
appropriations
bill
and
send
it
to
the
senate.
5690
was
the
house
anti-crime
bill.
many
of
the
provisions
were
similar
to
s.
1762
that
had
already
gone.
they
passed
5690
and
sent
it
over
to
the
senate.
what
the
senate
does
is
take
language
from
5690.
they
don't
by
means
of
a
staple,
tack
5690
on
to
648.
they
take
language
from
5690
and
send
it
back
to
the
house.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
well,
no.
and
you
have
to
look
at...
at
the
way
these
bills
have
raced
through
the
congress.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
by...
by
its
very
nature,
the
origination
clause
is
talking
about
who
passes
it
first
and...
and
by
its
very
nature,
you
can
always
say,
well,
the
house
passed
it
ultimately.
who
cares?
it
was
a
techaical
violation.
you
can
say
that
about
the
search
warrant
that
the
police
officer
could
have
gotten
but
didn't.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
well,
here's
the
problem.
it
calls
upon
the
court
to
evaluate
the
test
for
origination
and
the
government
suggests
there
can
be
a
variety
of
ways
to
originate
bills.
origination
indicates,
by
its
very
language,
that
you
originate
once.
if
the
language
test
is
the
test
adopted
by
the
court,
then
this
court
would
completely
topsy-turvy
the
existing
procedures
of
the
house
which
this
case,
from
respondent's
point
of
view,
does
not
require
the
court
to
do.
right
now,
if
the
senate
passes
a
revenue
bill
and
sends
it
to
the
house
and
the
house
is
now
considering
a
revenue
bill
and
it's
the
same
revenue
bill,
let's
say.
it
is
the
same
language.
the
staffers
have
talked
and
the
senate
just
gets
their
bill
over
to
the
house
first.
the
house
will
not
simply
insert
its
own
language
after
the
enacting
clause.
they
will
set
the
senate
bill
aside.
they
will
table
the
senate
bill
and
they
will
pass
the
same
bill
with
a
house
number
on
it
and
send
it
back
to
the
senate.
if
the
language
test
is
the
test
for
origination,
it
will
stop
that
procedure
from
happening
because
the
senate
would
have
passed
the
language
first.
but
you
don't
understand.
the
language
test
only
applies
when
the
result
is
to
say
that
it
did
originate
in
the
house.
then
the
language
test
applies.
the
language
does
not
apply--
--well,
that's
exactly
right.
that's
the
problem.
that's
exactly...
could
we
trade
places
for
just
a
moment?
[laughter]
that's
exactly
right.
a
further
problem
with
the
language
test
is
the
context
in
which
the
language
comes
from
and
gets
stuck
into.
we've
had
cases,
arguments,
hours
and
hours
over
commas
and
semicolons,
capital
letters
and
breaks
in
sentences.
so
the
language
test
could
throw
us
into
an
enormous
problem
with...
with
the
origination
clause
and
it
would
also
stop
the
house
from
doing
precisely
what
it's
done
for
hundreds
of
years.
and
that
is
take
senate
language
and
turn
it
into
a
house
bill.
the
clause
does
not
say
all
language
raising
revenue.
it
says
all
bills
raising
revenue.
we're
not
talking
about
language,
we're
talking
about
bills.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
it
was
always
a
bill
for
raising
revenue
because
of--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--because
of
the
arguments--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--when
the
senate
stuck
it
into
the
bill
that
passed.
when
the
senate
stuck
it--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--it
was
not
a
stapling
together--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--yes,
in
the
senate.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
no.
it
went
back
as
h.j.
res.
648.
it
was
still
part
of
the
house
bill.
it
was...
in
reality
what
we've
got
is
an
amendment
to
the
house
bill.
and
the
question
is...
then
becomes,
can
the
senate
amend
a
house
appropriation
and
crime
bill.
and
we
get
to
really
the
final
argument
of...
of
the
case.
the
government
wants
the
court
to--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--that
was
when
it
originated.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
yes.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
the
amendment
process--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--well,
that...
that
would
be
the
tail
chasing
the
cat.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
it's--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--well,
no,
i
think
that
is
backwards...
that
bills
for
raising
revenue
must
originate
in
the
house,
not
just
because
they
originate
in
the
house
they
are
bills
for
raising
revenue.
that--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--all
bills
for
raising
revenue
must
originate
in
the
house
of
representatives.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
therefore,
if
it
originates
in
the
house--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--well,
then
i
could
never
be
here.
you're
right.
if...
if
the
case
is
decided
that
way,
we
might
as
well
go
off
on
political--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--there
you
go.
that's
what
i
was
going
to
say.
we
could
just
go
off--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--happily.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
it
became
a
bill
for
raising
revenue
when
it
first
passed
the
house.
when
the
house
passed
the
bill
it
didn't
have
revenue
in
it.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
that's
right.
but
the
house
didn't--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--you
never
had
the
question.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
yes,
the
senate
passed
it
a
second
time.
but
it
originated
in
the
senate.
you
would
never
have
the
question
if
you
have
that
kind
of
circularity.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
thank
you,
mr.
justice
white.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
no,
we
don't
want
that.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
well,
in
reality
we
do
have
that
because
the...
but
the
senate
may
propose
or
concur
with
amendments
as
on
other
bills
as
has
been
read
to
me--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--that's
correct.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
it
doesn't
say
that.
but
it--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--no,
it
doesn't.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
no,
i
don't
think
that's...
that's
my
problem
at
all.
that
would
be
more
the...
the
government's
problem.
because
the
senate
can
amend
a
house
revenue
bill,
but
the
bill,
as
it
comes
to
the
senate,
must
be
a
revenue
bill
and
648
was
not
a
revenue
bill.
now,
that's
where
we
get
into
the
final
argument
basically
and
that
is
can
the
senate
amend
a
house
appropriations
bill?
i
say
we
don't
have
to
reach
that
in
this
case
because,
as
the
district
court
found,
and
the
government
didn't
complain
and,
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
the
amendment
was
to
crime
control.
and
you
don't
even
have
to
go
beyond
and
look
at
the
appropriations.
and
if
you
do
go
beyond
and
look
at
the
entirety
of
the
bill,
nothing
in
648...
i
don't
think
this
court
has
to
address
the
appropriation
context,
but
nothing
in
648,
either
the
appropriations
portion
or
the
crime
portion,
were
revenue
raising.
and
that's
the
bottom
line.
if
there
are
not
further
questions.
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
i
think
that--
ms.
judy
clare
clarke
--i
think
that
they
could
simply
redo
the
bill
and
repass
it
to
the
president.
oh,
i
know
that
they
could,
but
they
didn't.
they
did
it
in
the
wrong
order
and
the
bill
is
then
promulgated
and
there
is
a
lawsuit
and
you--
--i
think
there's
a
problem
with
that.
i
think
i
have
to
say
that.
