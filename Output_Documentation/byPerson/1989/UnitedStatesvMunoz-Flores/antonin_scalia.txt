justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
say
the
same
thing,
mr.
bryson,
for
the
legislative
veto?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
i
mean,
so
long
as
the
president...
you
could
say
so
long
as
the
thing
only
comes
up
if...
suppose
the
president's
entirely
happy
with
the
legislation
he
gets
that
he
wouldn't
otherwise
have
gotten
that
contains
a
legislative
veto
and
he
is
perfectly
willing
to
implement
it
that
way
to
give
away
his
powers.
we
wouldn't
let
him
do
that,
would
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
should
we
let
the
house
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
inter-house
dispute
which
is
just
as
important
as
far
as
separation
of
the
various
powers
of
the
government
is
concerned.
isn't
that
significant?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that...
but
that's
just
demeaning
the
importance
of
the
constitutional
provision.
you
may
be
quite
right
that
it's
not
very
important
but
that's
not
for
us
to
judge.
it
was
written
there...
just
the
sequence
requirement
is
written
there
just
as
clearly
as
the
bicameral
requirement.
why...
why
shouldn't
we
give
full
effect
to
the
one
just
as
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
could
allow
the
president
to
decide
whether
the...
the
bill
veto
clause
has
been...
has
been
offended.
but
we
don't.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that...
but
that
begs
the
question.
it
is
not
a
statute
if
it
hasn't
complied
with
the
requirements
for
a
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
one
of
those
requirements
is...
is
this
sequence,
then
it's
not
a
statute,
just
as
something
that
is
passed
without
both
houses
is
not
a
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
all
these
sequential
things
don't...
don't
amount
to
much.
maybe...
maybe
you're
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
don't
want
to
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bryson,
i...
i
will...
i
will
remind
the
solicitor
general
of
the
argument
you
are
making
today
at
the
time
when
the
house
and
the
senate
decide
that
it
would
be
much
more
efficient
to
conduct
all
of
their
business
through
joint
committees.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
at
that
point
i...
i
will
say
that
the
justice
department
seems
to
have
taken
the
position
that
after
all
this
is...
this
is
a
family
affair,
it's
just
an
internal
dispute
within
the
legislative
branch
and
that's
really
not
as
important
as
disputes
between
the
separate
branches.
justice
antonin
scalia
precisely
my
point,
mr.
bryson.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the...
what
if
the
senate
is
the
first
one
to
conceive
of...
of
the
bill
on...
on
that
theory?
i
mean,
let's
assume
that
a
senate
committee
had
first
devised
the
notion,
then
the
senate
would
have
originated
the
bill,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
fact
that
the
house
thought
of
it
first
means
that
it
originated
in
the
house,
but
the
fact
that
the
senate
thought
of
it
first
does
not
mean
that
it
originated
in
the
senate.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
the
answer
or
you
lose.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
otherwise
you
lose.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
in
england,
the...
the
house
of
lords
could
not
amend
the
bill.
once
you
say...
i
mean,
as
this
thing
came
out
of
the
convention,
it
was
compromise
between
those
who
wanted
to
follow
the
english
practice,
which
said
it
had
to
originate
in
the
lower
house,
and
no
amendment
was
permitted
in
the
upper
house,
and
those
who
didn't
want
that
provision.
so
what
they
adopted
was...
was
this
compromise
in
which
it
has
to
start
in
the
house
but
once
it
starts
there,
the
senate
can
do
anything
it
wants
to
it.
which...
you've
got
to
admit
there's
not
a
whole...
very
sharp
teeth
to
that
provision
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
clarke,
another
clause
of
the
constitution
says
that
a
majority
of
each
house
shall
constitute
a
quorum
to
do
business.
it's
my
understanding
that
unless
there
is
a
quorum
call
on
the
floor,
it
is
quite
common
for
bills
to
be
passed
when
there
is
not
a
majority
of
the
house
present.
is
that
litigable
in
court?
could
you
object
to
the...
to
the
statute
that
comes
out
of
that
process
because
there
was
not
a
quorum
on
the
floor?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
we
assume
the
same
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
you
destroy
the
quorum
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
quorum
clause
is
a
lot
more
significant
than
this
clause.
this
clause
just...
just
does
not
have
that
many
teeth.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
you'd
probably
have
to
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
for
the...
for
the
quantity
of
it.
but
above...
below
the
minimum
you
have
to
impose
the
minimum.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the...
if
the
statute
provides
for
a
fine
in
a
certain
range,
the
discretion
only
extends
up
from
the
minimum.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm...
i'm
curious...
i
assume
it's...
i
assume
it's
the
same
answer
you
gave
to
the
quorum
provision.
but
what
about
the
horrible
that
the
government
put
forward,
and
that
is
the
president
returns
a
vetoed
bill
to
the
wrong
house--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and...
and
then
they
proceed
to
override
but
in
the
wrong
sequence?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
it's
not
the
government
giving
and...
and
the
taxpayer
receiving.
i
mean,
it's
quite
a
different
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
in
a
sense
you
say,
no,
it's
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
people.
well,
every
statute
is
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
people.
the
government
doesn't
pass
any
statute
that
isn't
purportedly
for
the...
for
the
common
good,
not
for
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
that
she
was
saying
about
the
earlier
cases
that...
that,
sure,
they...
they
benefitted
all
the
people
ultimately
but
proximately
they
benefitted
the
banks.
