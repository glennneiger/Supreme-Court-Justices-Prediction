justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
all
of
your
comments
to
the
effect
that
this
is
just
ministerial
and
it
seems
to
be
rather
a
minor
matter
are
quite
inconsistent
with
the
other
prong
of
your
argument
in
which
you
tell
us
the
house
has
been
very
jealous
to
guard
this
prerogative.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
would
assume
that
this
is
a
very
important
prerogative
for
the
house.
and
i
would
also
assume
that
it
might
be
that
there
is
a
majority
of
one
party
in
the
senate
and
very
slim
majority
of
the
same
party
in
the
house
and
that
the
minority
members
in
the
house
would
have
a
very
great
interest
in
the
preservation
of
this...
of
this
provision
and
not
just
supinely
surrendering
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
agree
that
bicameralism
is
one
of
the
most
important
structural
components
of
the
constitution
insofar
as
the
federalist
papers
and
framers
were
concerned?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you...
you
cannot
characterize
this
as
using
the
courts
to
aid
victims?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
this
is
not
like
a
user
fee...
the
use
of
the
courts,
even
though
it's
involuntary.
it's
somewhat
twisted--
