we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
88-1932,
united
states
against
german
munoz-flores.
mr.
bryson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
mr.
bryson,
does
that
mean
in
some
other
case
one
would
not
defer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bryson,
in
buckley
against
valeo
the
court
held
that
the
provision
in
the
federal
election
commission
act
providing
for
appointments
violated
the
president's
authority
under
the
appointments
clause.
now,
the
president
signed
that
bill
and
we
did
not
treat
that
as
a
waiver
or
kind
of
an
expression
of
general
satisfaction.
i
think
he
might
have
made
a
signing
statement.
i
don't
remember.
so
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
if...
if
you're
going
to
rely
here
on
the
kind
of
the
general
satisfaction
of
everybody
involved
with
what
went
on,
you
have
to
say
that
conflicts
between
the
house
and
the
senate,
or
possible
conflicts,
do
not
amount
to
the
same
thing
as
inter-branch
conflicts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
ms.
clarke.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
distinguish
the
nebeker
case
on
that
point,
ms.
clarke?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
was
the
direct
benefit
that
the
banks
got
in
nebeker?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
clarke,
was
there
any
substantial
opposition
to
either
of
these
bills?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well...
the
reason
for
my
question
is...
we're
really
talking
about
a
fairly
technical
violation
of
the
clause
in
question
here,
the...
the
origination
clause.
it...
it
doesn't
look
as
if
the
senate
were
trying
to
strong-arm
the
house
or
something
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes...
yes,
but
somehow
the
search
warrant
that
the
police
officer
could
have
gotten
but
didn't
doesn't
seem
quite
the
same
to
me
in
terms
of...
of
what
we're
talking
about
as
a
practical
matter.
and
i
realize
its
in
the
constitution
and
perhaps
it
should
be
enforced
just
as
rigorously
as
any
other
provision.
but
it...
it
just
does
not
seem
that
it
amounts
to
much
more
within
the
technicality
of
this
particular
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
clarke.
mr.
bryson,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
mr.
bryson.
the
case
is
submitted.
