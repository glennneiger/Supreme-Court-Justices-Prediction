justice
o'connor
mr.
wright,
should
we
read...
should
we
view
section
210
as
just
providing
an
additional
federal
remedy
for
circumstances
such
as
in
this
case?
justice
o'connor
you
suggested
in
the
government's
brief...
or
the
government's
brief
suggested,
anyway,
that
somehow
there
might
be
some
kind
of
federal
preemption
of
certain
defenses
by
virtue
of
section
210.
justice
o'connor
i
must
say,
i
don't
understand
that.
can
there
be
selective
preemption
for
certain
aspects
of
the
state
suit?
justice
o'connor
what?
