mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
contrary
to
what
certainly
mr.
payne
has
said,
and
to
a
certain
extent
to
what
the
solicitor
general's
office
has
argued,
this
is
a
case
about
nuclear
safety.
section
210
of
the
energy
reorganization
act
is
a
statute
that
protects
whistleblowers
at
nuclear
facilities
from
retaliation
by
their
employers
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
that
those
facilities
are
operated
consistent
with
public
health
and
safety.
the
enforcement
mechanisms
and
procedures
and
remedies
provided
by
section
210
are
an
integral
part
of
the
field
of
safety
that
the
congress
and
this
court
have
long
recognized
to
be
an
exclusive
matter
of
federal
concern.
there
is
frankly
no
room
for
an
alternative
mechanism
or
procedure
under
state
tort
law
for
activity
plainly
covered
under
section
210.
and,
therefore,
petitioner's
efforts
to
obtain
additional
relief
in
the
form
of
a
$1.3
million
request
for
compensatory
damages
and
a
$2.3
billion
request
for
punitive
damages
for
a
claim
that
she
describes
in
her
own
complaint
as
one
arising
for
reprisals
with
respect
to
her
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
for
disclosing
to
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
noncompliance
with
law
by
general
electric,
must
fail.
because
safety
in
the
operation
of
a
nuclear
facility
is
directly
implicated
in
this
case,
it
must
properly
be
analyzed
under
the
field
preemption
doctrines
that
this
court
applied
in
pacific
gas
&
electric
and
in
silkwood.
in
those
cases,
the
court
made
absolutely
clear
that
the
federal
government
has
occupied
the
entire
field
of
nuclear
safety
concerns.
accordingly,
the
appropriate
legal
standard
for
analyzing
the
preemption
in
this
case
is
the
standard
the
court
announced
initially
in
rice
and
reaffirmed
in
pg&e,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
matter
on
the
which
the
state
asserts
the
right
to
act
is
in
any
way
regulated
by
the
federal
act.
in
order
to
evaluate
that,
then,
we
must
begin
by
examining
what
it
is
that
the
federal
statute
regulates
in
this
case.
clearly,
the
federal
scheme
regulates
retaliation
in
the
work
place
for
reporting
violations
of
safety
requirements
and
threats
that
such
retaliation...
excuse
me...
and
treats
such
retaliation
as
itself
a
serious
safety
concern.
what
the
solicitor
general
ignores
and
what
the
petitioner
plainly
ignores
is
the
fact
that
these
kinds
of
reprisals
and
retaliations
have
been
recognized
by
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
since
1973
as
a
serious
matter
of
safety
vel
non.
that
is,
that
the
fact
of
retaliation
is
itself
a
significant
risk
to
the
safety
of
the
nuclear
facility,
and
the
nrc
has
explicit
and
specific
authority
not
only
to
condition
a
license
but
to
revoke
a
license
solely
as
a
consequence
of
an
employer
retaliating
against
an
employee
for
actually
presenting
the
nrc,
or
even
the
employer,
with
a
concern
with
respect
to
safety.
thus,
this
is
not
peripheral
concern
to
the
nrc.
this
is
at
the
core
of
how
the
nrc
ensures
both
technical
safety
in
the
facilities,
management
concern
for
safety
in
the
facilities
and
assures
that
other
employees
are
not
deterred
from
bringing
forth
either
to
the
nrc
or
to
the
employers
the
kinds
of
concerns
about
safety
that
they
may
have.
in
addition,
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
by
looking
at
the
elements
of
section
210
that
it
is...
that
it
is
designed
ultimately
to
promote
safety
as
its
ultimate
goal.
while
it
does,
of
course,
provide
specific
remedies
for
the
employees,
its
discrete
elements
also
reflect
that
the
ultimate
purpose
of
this
legislation
is
to
ensure
nuclear
safety
at
every
facility.
first,
section
210
does
have
a
short
limitations
period,
which
is
unquestionably
going
to
encourage
problems
with
safety
to
be
reported
quickly
to
the
secretary
of
labor.
second,
the
provision
directly
contemplates
a
close
interrelationship
between
the
secretary
of
labor
and
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
so
the
commission
can
act
immediately
upon
being
informed
of
a
problem
with
the
secretary
of
labor--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
the
question
is
to
whom
they
have
reported
the
violation.
the
majority
of
circuits
hold
that
a
report
to
the
employer
which
has
not
made
it
to
the
nrc
is
itself
protected
activity
under
section
210
and,
therefore,
retaliation
for
those
reports
are
compensable.
the
nrc
would
never
have
learned
about
that
kind
of
conduct
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--for
the
fact
of
a
filing
with
section
210.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
not
so
in
this
case.
but
the
second
part
that
section
210
worries
about
as
a
safety
concern
is
the
fact
of
retaliation.
the
fact,
if
proved,
that
mrs.
english
was
subjected
to
a
course
of
harassment
in
the
four
months
before
her
final
layoff
is
a
concern
to
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
by
itself
and,
therefore,
you
need
to
have
section
210
in
order
to
promote
that
secondary
but
very
vital
safety
concern
embodied
in
this
statute.
in
addition,
section
210
provides
full
compensatory
relief.
there's
an
opportunity
for
back
pay
and
reinstatement
and
compensation
for
injuries.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
because
the
value
of
knowing
the
nature
of
the
remedy
is
that
the
legal
test
under
rice
is,
is
this
a
matter
in
anyway
regulated
by
the
federal
government?
if
the
federal
government
is
providing
you
a
specific
remedy
for
the
precise
claims
you
bring
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
then
it's
absolutely
clear
that
the
action
on
which
the
state
is
operating
is
precisely
the
same
as
the
federal
government,
and
if
you
are
in
an
area
of
federal
preemption,
then
the
state
action
must
be
set
aside.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
oh,
no,
that's
true,
justice
white.
i
would
be
here
arguing
today
just
as
strenuously
if
section
210
did
not
exist
because
of
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission's
regulation
that
recognizes
the
discrimination--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--in
terms
and
conditions.
but,
as
this
court
recognized
in
silkwood,
it
felt
at
least
some
uneasiness
with
the
inadequacy
of
the
remedy
that
otherwise
would
exist.
to
the
extent
that
was
any
concern
in
silkwood,
it
is
clearly
not
a
concern
in
this
specific
case.
with
respect
to
the
last
two
elements
of
section
210,
it
only
permits
the
secretary
to
obtain
punitive
damages,
not
the
employee,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
to
insure
against
over-deterrence
from
employer's
who
have
reason
to
respond
to
employee
problems
which
themselves
can
be
a
serious
safety
concern.
and
finally,
section
210
precludes
relief
when
an
employee
deliberately
violates
section
210(a).
and
i
think
in
that
respect
it's
important
to
i
think
get
a
little
more
mileage
out
of
section
210(g)
than
perhaps
we
did
in
our
brief
because
if
you
read
210(g),
it
accepts
a
remedy
under
section
210(a)
itself,
which
the
solicitor
general
pointed
out
in
his
brief.
but
that
suggests
to
me
that
congress
must
have
anticipated
that
section
210(a)
is
the
only
appropriate
relief
for
these
kinds
of
work
place
problems
because
it
is
inconceivable
that
congress
would
have
said,
no,
we
absolutely
don't
want
you
to
get
any
recovery,
including
reinstatement,
under
section
210(a),
but
we
have
no
concerns
whatsoever
that
you
can
go
to
state
court
on
a
wrongful
discharge
action
and
be
placed
right
back
in.
that's
not
the
way
congress
would
have
operated.
i
think
the
limitations
in
section
210(g)
clearly
reflect
congress'
expectation
that
state
law
was
not
going
to
be
available
to
an
individual
in
mrs.
english's
position.
accordingly,
the
elements
of
section
210
operate
in
tandem
with
the
general
preemption
of
the
field
of
nuclear
safety
in
a
way
that
makes
mrs.
english's
claim
unquestionably
preempted.
one
other
element
that
i
suggest
aids
us
with
respect
to
the
preemption
question
is
the
kind
of
analysis
the
court
employed
in
schneidewind,
where
it
said
when
you're
dealing
with
occupation
of
the
field
problems
what
you
need
to
worry
about
is
whether
there
is
an
imminent
threat
of
conflict
between
the
way
the
state
operates...
the
state
law
operates
and
the
way
the
federal
concerns
are
being
employed.
and
in...
and
in
this
case,
it's
clear
to
me
that
if
you
give
someone
the
opportunity
to
seek
punitive
damages,
$2.3
billion,
they
are
going
to
go
to
state
court
and
they
are
not
going
to
go
to
the
secretary
of
labor,
and
a
lot
of
impertant
safety
concerns
are
not
going
to
be
brought
timely
and
promptly
to
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
in
a
way
that
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
way
the
scheme
operates
and
completely
inconsistent
with
notions
of
field
preemption.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
a
calculation
at
the
time,
at
least
of
the
complaint,
of
5
percent
of
the...
i
think
gross...
of
the
assets
of
ge,
and
it
was
a
calculation
the
district
court
made
in
this
case
as
to
what...
as
to
what
was
asked
for.
notwithstanding
in
my
mind
the
clear
field
preemption
argument
that
applies
in
this
case
and
ousts
mrs.
english's
claim,
petitioner
and
her
amici
offer
three
rationales
for
holding
that
the
claim
is
not
preempted.
first,
petitioner's
primary
answer
in
her
reply
brief
is
that
section
210(g)...
excuse
me...
section
210
is
not
itself
a
serious
safety
statute
in
the
nuclear
field.
it
may
concern
safety,
but
it
is...
it
has
antecedents
in
non-nuclear
areas
and,
therefore,
is
beside
the
point
for
purposes
of
nuclear
safety.
i
submit
to
you
that
that
is
an
incredible
interpretation
of
a
statute
that
is
clearly
part
of
the
nuclear
field
that
has
been
occupied
by
the
federal
government
for
the
last
25
years
and
is
an
incredible
assessment
of
how
congress
operates
when
it
enacts
legislation,
and
that
there's
simply
no
basis
for
ignoring
the
safety
concerns
underlying
section
210
that
exist
in
this
case.
second,
petitioner
and
her
amici
argue,
i
think
somewhat
more
strenuously,
but
with
no
greater
effect,
that
field
preemption
doctrine
in
the
nuclear
area
ought
to
be
turned
on
its
head.
that
is,
that
in
this
area
alone...
in
the
area
of
nuclear
safety,
which
i
submit
is
probably
as
important
and
one
that
requires
a
uniform
federal
role
as
any
area
of
law
that
i
can
imagine,
the
federal
government
comes
to
the
court
and
says
in
this
one
area
what
you
need
is
a
good
purpose.
that
is,
if
you
have
a
non-safety
purpose
in
your
state
law
for
what
you're
doing,
that
you
are
free
to
walk
through
the
federal
field
that's
otherwise
preempted
by
the
federal
government.
that
is
not
what
this
court
held
in
silkwood.
in
fact,
it
is
manifestly
inconsistent
with
what
the
court
said
in
pacific
gas
&
electricity,
where
it
held
it
would
be
clearly
impermissible
for
california
to
regulate
the
construction
and
operation
of
a
nuclear
facility
for
such
regulation,
even
if
enacted
out
of
a
non-safety
concern,
would
nevertheless
directly
conflict
with
the
nrc's
authority
over
plant
construction
and
operation.
the
government
turns
the
issue
of
state
purpose
on
its
head
in
this
case.
the
purpose
inquiry
in
that
case
was,
if
you're
in
an
area
ceded
to
the
state
and
you
have
nevertheless
a
purpose
to
interfere
with
nuclear
safety
or
you're
operating
for
nuclear
safety
reasons,
you
are
nevertheless
preempted
even
though
it's
an
area
that
congress
had
ceded
to
the
states.
it
in
no
way
supports
the
argument
that
if
you
are
in
the
area
of
operations
of
a
nuclear
facility
that
if
your
purpose
happens
to
be
not
to
interfere
with
nuclear
safety
in
anyway,
that
that
nevertheless
is
somehow
exempt
from
field
preemption
analysis.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
our
argument
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--absolutely.
no
question
about
that,
justice
scalia.
i
conceded
essentially
as
much
in
our
brief.
the
point
here
is
that
the
scope
of
the
field
that
congress
has
preempted
in
this
case
is
defined
by
section
210.
210
says
that
the
federal
government's
safety
concerns
are
regulated...
and
that's
important...
regulated,
not
just
a
matter
of
some
concern
to
the
federal
government,
but
are
regulated...
then
what
you're
talking
about
is
retaliation
for
reporting
safety
violations.
when
you're
in
that
sphere,
the
federal
government
regulates
it,
and
if
you
purport
to
act
through
state
law,
no
matter
what
label
you
want
to
place
on
the
state
tort
action,
you
are
nevertheless
preempted
under
any
kind
of
conventional
theory
of
field
preemption
law.
if
you
go
beyond
that
field,
that
is,
does...
does
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
regulate
murder
or
battery
as
part
of
the
discrimination
in
terms
and
conditions
of
employment--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
answer
is
clearly
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
see
what
you're
saying.
well...
i
mean,
i...
fortunately,
i
don't
have
to
defend
the
argument
that
would
nevertheless
be
preempted,
although
i
think
you
could
read
the
majority
opinion
in
pacific
gas
&
electric
as
suggesting
that
if
you
have
an
impermissible
purpose,
even
though
you're
dealing
in
an
area
ceded
to
the
states,
that
that
may
be
preempted.
but
the
court
in
that
case
held
that
that
wasn't
a
problem
because
that
wasn't
the
purpose
of
the
law.
and
my
guess
is
that
most
instances,
since
you
are
talking
about
a
general
criminal
statute,
that's
not
going
to
be
any
kind
of
a
problem
because
it's
clear
that...
what
the
purpose
of
the
murder
statute
will
be.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
in...
in
field
preemption
areas
this
court
has
never
said
we
look
at
labels
for
what
the
state
is
doing.
in
the
field
preemption
area
you
have
to
look
at
the
specifics
of
what's
at
issue
and
what
is
the
matter
that
the
state
purports
to
regulate.
and
the
matter
that
the
state
purports
to
regulate
under
mrs.
english's
own
complaint
is
retaliation
in
the
work
place
arising
out
of...
out
of
reporting
of
safety
violations.
and
that's...
that's
what
her
claim
is.
and
if
she
goes
further
and
says
not
only
should
have
received
recompense
for
wrongful
discharge,
but
there
were
some
additional
injury
imposed
upon
me
of
an
emotional
character.
but
the
district
court
went
through
each
one
of
those
elements
and
concluded
that
all
five
of
the
elements
of
her
complaint
are
clearly
compensable
under
section
210.
and
if
you
excise
out
all
that's
compensable
under
section
210,
what
remains
of
mrs.
english's
complaint
is
wholly
inadequate
to
stay
a
cause
of
action
for
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
as
a
matter
of
north
carolina
tort
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
or
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
agree
that...
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
distinction,
though,
is
the
one
congress
made.
and
i'm
sure
the
reason
it
made
the
distinction
is
that
the
most
likely
response
in
an
employment
setting
to
a...
a
report
of
a
safety
violation
is
that
you're
going
to
retaliate
in
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
it
is
not
rational
to
assume
that
your
basic
nuclear
licensee
is
going
to
go
out
and
hire
thugs
and
start
shooting
people.
and
congress
responded
to
what
it
perceived
to
be
the
most
general
and
likely
problem
by
saying
that's
a
serious
safety
problem
that
we
need
to
regulate
on
a
day-to-day
basis.
for
the...
for
the
once
in
a
lifetime...
hopefully
never
in
a
lifetime...
situation
where
the
kind
of
general
laws
you're
talking
about
might
come
into
play,
it
seems
quite
rational
to
me
for
congress
to
say
we're
content
to
allow
the
states
to
respond
to
that
problem,
that
is
a
matter
of
serious
concern
to
them,
it
doesn't
affect
us
in
a
regular
way
that
requires
us
to
have
the
nrc
and
the
secretary
of
labor
jointly
regulating
to
further
the
ultimate
ends
of
safety
in
a
nuclear
facility.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
it's...
it
is
retaliation
for
violations
of
the
nrc's
rules
and
requirements.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
vast
majority
of
the
rules
and
requirements
are
designed
to
promote
safety
in
one
sense
or
another.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but...
but,
see,
i...
i
would
still
say
that
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that
is
true,
justice
white,
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
the
way
the
statute
is
designed,
there
would
be
field
preemption
there
because,
again,
i
think
that
what...
what
the
basic
judgment
under
section
210
is,
is
that
any
time
you
have
a
situation
where
management
is
defying
requirements
of
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission,
that
is
in
itself
a
serious
safety
concern.
now,
it
may
not
be
that
the
specific
problem
is
safety
related,
but
that
kind
of
defiance
is
something
the
nrc
needs
to
know
for
purposes
of
providing...
of
deciding
whether
or
not
this
is
somebody
who
should
retain
the
privilege
of
a
license
to
operate
a
nuclear
facility.
let
me
turn
just
quickly
to
the
point
that
i
think
is
terribly
important
in
this
case,
and
that
is
the
scope
of
the
preemption
that
general
electric
urges
in
this
case.
we're
not
saying
that
all
whistleblowing
statutes
preempt
all
state
law.
section
210
was
enacted
against
a
backdrop
of
a
very
specialized
concern
of
nuclear
safety.
the
history
of
nuclear
regulation
in
this
country,
as
outlined
in
the
pacific
gas
&
electric
case,
makes
that
clear,
and
i
think
congress
knew
that
when
it
enacted
this
statute
and
had
reached
the
conclusion
that
it
did,
that
this
is
the
appropriate
way
to
proceed.
and
that's...
and
so
that
if
the
court
holds
that
section
210
is
preemptive,
to
my
mind
that
says
nothing
about
preemption
elsewhere.
in
addition,
we
do
not
urge
the
court
to
hold
that
all
kinds
of
state
tort
actions
or
all
state
criminal
laws
are
preempted
in
this
setting.
our...
our
position
is
that
what
is
preempted
is
that
which
the
federal
regulates
and
that's
changes
in
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
thus,
our
claim
here
is
a
relatively
narrow,
and
one
that
i
think--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
but
the
rest
of
her
claim,
the
harassment
parts
of
her
claim,
are
still
covered
by
section
210.
she
can
get
full
recompense
under
section
210
for
everything
that's
alleged
in
her
complaint
with
the
possible
exception...
this
is
not
clear
to
me...
but
with
the
possible
exception
of
being
escorted
out
under
armed
guard.
everything
else
is...
is
covered
because
section
210
not
only
deals
with
sort
of
technical
and
formal
altering
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
but,
like
title
vii
in
the
meritor
analysis
the
court
employed
a
couple
of
terms
ago,
it
also
responds
to
the
problems
of
general
reprisals
and
an
atmosphere
of
harassment.
and
all
of
her
claims
fall
squarely
into
that
and
all
of
those
claims
have
been
upheld
as
stating
a
claim
under
section
210
by
the
fourth
circuit
with
respect
to
mrs.
english
herself.
so,
the
opportunity
for
recompense
for
everything
she's
alleged
is
still
there,
with
one
exception,
and
that
exception
the
district
court
specifically
found
as
a
matter
of
state
law
is
not
enough
to
state
a
claim
for
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
in
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
precisely
my
position,
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
would
rely
on
rice
for
that
point,
which
is
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
matter
the
state
purports
to
regulate
and
determine
whether
or
not
that
is
a
subject
matter
regulated
by
the
federal
government.
and
i
don't
know
what
can
more
clearly
demonstrate
regulation
by
the
federal
government
than
that
the
federal
government
accepts
a
claim
for
that
and
provides
complete
recompense
for
the
claim
that
you
bring
forward.
in
sum,
the
rule
proposed
by
general
electric
is
not
designed
to
be
all
or
nothing.
our
position
is
that
the
federal
government's
expressly
preempted
occupied
field
of
nuclear
safety
should
be
respected
by
this
court
and
the
role...
the
vital
role
that
section
210
plays
in
that
ought
to
be
recognized
by
the
court
and
the
scope
of
preemption
defined
by
reference
to
the
specific
provisions
of
section
210.
outside
of
that
field,
it's
clear
to
me
that
the
state's
retain
all
of
the
authority
they
otherwise
would
have
to
regulate
nuclear
facilities.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
it's
very
important
to
understand,
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
i
didn't
make
this
point
clearly--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
question
is
how
do
you
define
the
field,
and
the
field...
and
if
section
210
is
in
the
field,
it
is
part
of
the
definition
of
the
field.
and
if
what
you
purport
to
regulate
as
a
matter
of
state
law
is
precisely
what
the
federal
government
regulates
under
section
210,
you
are
in
the
field
of
nuclear
safety,
and
the
states
are
not
permitted
to
be
there,
regardless
of
what
their
purpose
in
being
there.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there's
no
question
that
there
might
be
a
broader
theory.
but
i
am
content,
frankly,
to
win
on
the
theory
that
this
is
precisely
the
same
thing
that
section
210
provides
for,
and
that,
to
me
at
least
without
any
question
in
my
mind,
has
to
be
part
of
the
field
preemption
analysis.
whether
it
could
go
further
is
certainly
there,
and
we
make
some
arguments
in
the
briefs
that
might
reflect
that.
but
i
think
the
basic...
easiest
basis
for
deciding
this
case
is
to
say
what
is
the
relationship
between
the
210
recovery
and
what
she
seeks
from
state
law,
and
there's
a
complete
correspondence
on
that
point,
and
what
is
leftover,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
not
a
complete
correspondence,
is
insufficient
to
permit
her
to
go
forward
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
let
me
conclude
by
what
i
started.
this
is
a
case
about
nuclear
safety,
and
it
is
clear
to
me
that
petitioner's
complaint
predominantly
intrudes
into
the
area
of
exclusive
federal
concern
and
what
is
left
of
her
claim
is
simply
insufficient
as
a
matter
of
law.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
dismissing
her
complaint
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
waive
the
balance
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice.
