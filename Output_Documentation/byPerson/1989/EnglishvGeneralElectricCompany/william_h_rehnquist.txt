chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-152,
vera
english
v.
general
electric
corporation.
mr.
payne.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
payne,
what...
what
was
the
finding
of
the
district
court
and
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether
you
had
stated
a
claim
under
north
carolina
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that
that
did...
your...
your
pleadings,
therefore,
did
state
a
claim
under
north
carolina
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
payne.
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
is
a...
this
hypothetical
is
a
battery
committed
by
the
corporation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
mr.
phillips,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
if
you
say
the...
the
criminal
law
is
not
preempted
because
that's
not
the
kind
of
thing
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission
is
interested
in,
couldn't
you
say
the
same
thing
about
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
that
the...
that
210
doesn't
purport
to
deal
with
that,
just
as
it
doesn't
purport
to
deal
with
battery?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
her...
her
claim
isn't...
isn't
for
simply
a
wrongful
discharge
under
state
law,
as
i
understand
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
your
theory
is
that
she
may
not
rely
on
any
element
for
which
she
could
get
compensation
under
section
210
in
trying
to
state
a
claim
under
state
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
payne.
chief
justice
rehnquist
how...
how
about
allis
chalmers
against
luick
that
we
decided
two...
two
or
three
years
ago?
there
the
state
law,
as
i
recall
it,
did
not
deal
just
with
labor
relations
and
yet
we
held
it
preempted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
the
court
said
if
the...
if
the
state
law
requires
getting
into
any
sort
of
interpretation
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it's
preempted.
but
there,
the
state
law
was
a
general
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
it
depends--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--on
what
history
the
state
law
is
grounded
in
whether
or
not
it's
preempted?
chief
justice
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired...
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
payne.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
