justice
scalia
now,
wait...
wait.
the...
the
discharge
as
a...
as
an
act
may
not
be
essential,
but...
but
wasn't...
wasn't
an
essential
part
of
your
case
the
fact
that
knowing
that
they
planned
to
discharge
her
all
the
time,
they
made
her
go
through
all
of
these
things?
if
they
didn't
really
plan
to
discharge
her
at
all,
wouldn't
that
make
your
case
a
lot
weaker?
i
mean,
it...
it...
it
may
not
be
a
separate
humiliation--
justice
scalia
--a
relatively
minor
humiliation,
but
all
the
rest
are
only...
only
terrible
humiliations
because
the
company
knew
it
was
going
to
fire
her
all
along.
justice
scalia
so
in
that
sense,
it's
important
to
your
case.
justice
scalia
sure.
justice
scalia
he
can
impose
punitive
damages,
too,
can't
he,
under
210?
justice
scalia
no?
justice
scalia
xxx.
justice
scalia
it
is
an
employment
protection
statute
that
is
designed
to
make
sure
that
the
agency
is
doing
its
job
or
the,
in
this
case,
the
utility
is
doing
its
job
properly.
justice
scalia
that's
right.
justice
scalia
i...
i
don't
find
that
line
you're
trying
to
draw
between
labor
protection
and
safety
a
clear
one.
i--
justice
scalia
--i
think
that
that's
how
we
have
to
decide
these...
these
matters,
to
decide
whether
this
is
a
labor
provision
or
a
safety
provision.
justice
scalia
although
you
acknowledge
it
does
have
safety
aspects.
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
are
you
saying
if
this
was
real
preemption,
a
battery
would
be
preempted
as
well?
is
that
your
point?
justice
scalia
i
mean
suppose...
suppose
a
state
has
a...
has
a
law
that
says
you
can't
break
somebody's
legs
in
order
to
make
him
commit
an
unsafe
practice
in
a
nuclear
facility.
would
that
be
preempted?
justice
scalia
i
know
it's
troubling.
justice
scalia
it's
right
in
the
heart
of
nuclear
safety,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
regardless.
justice
scalia
regardless,
would
that
state
law
be
precluded
because
it's
squarely
in
the
field
of
nuclear
safety?
justice
scalia
wow.
justice
scalia
well,
this
one...
this
one
isn't
aimed
particularly
at
this
field
either.
justice
scalia
yeah.
right.
justice
scalia
any
general
law
is
not
preempted
even
if
it's
in
the...
directly
in
the
safety
field?
justice
scalia
xxx
called
field
preemption
and
conflict?
don't
you...
aren't
you
ultimately
coming
back
to
a
conflict
all
the
time?
justice
scalia
what
you
are
saying
is
that
it
is
not
the
purpose
of
the
federal
law
to
make
them
any
safer
than
it
made
them.
there
is
a
tradeoff
between
how
safe
you
want
to
get
and
what
the
costs
of
improved
safety
are,
and
the
federal
law
said
we
want
them
this
safe
and
no
safer.
justice
scalia
and
to
make
them
safer
than
that
is
to
create
a
conflict.
justice
scalia
what
is
the
$2.3
billion
figure,
mr.
phillips?
justice
scalia
what
do
you
do...
what
do
you
do
about
the
general
criminal
law
examples
that
the
government
gives?
you
know,
the
company
hires
somebody
to...
to
murder
an
individual
who
makes
a
safety
complain.
justice
scalia
i
assume
that
state
law
would
be
applicable.
justice
scalia
well,
i--
justice
scalia
--yeah,
but,
my...
my
hypothetical
was
the
reason
for
the
murder
was
to
punish
the
person
for
reporting
the
safety
violation
and
to
prevent
further
safety
violations.
that
was
the
reason
for
the
murder.
justice
scalia
i
think
the
way
you...
you've
distinguished
the
murder
case
and
the
battery
case
ultimately
is
that...
is
that
you
say
that
all
that
210
deals
with
is,
as
you
just
phrased
it,
retaliation
in
the
work
place...
retaliation
through
dismissal.
justice
scalia
or
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
so
it
would
be
only
general
state
laws
relating
to
that
very
narrow
area.
justice
scalia
yeah,
but
that...
but
that
seems
so
irrational
that
the...
the
federal
government
doesn't
care
how
much
you...
you
tinker
with
whistleblowing
and...
and
how
much
you...
you
alter
the
balance
between...
that
delicate
balance
that
you
point
out
between
how
much
incentive
and
disincentive
you
want
to
whistleblowing.
we
don't
care
what...
how
you
do
it
through
other
laws,
just
don't
do
it
through
laws
that
relate
narrowly
to
retaliation
through
dismissal
or
other
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
i
mean,
gee,
there
are
a
lot
of
other
ways
to...
to
dispute--
justice
scalia
--which
is
not
persuasive.
right?
justice
scalia
it
seems
to
me,
however,
that
once
you...
you
do
narrow
your
argument
like
that
and
say,
all
we're
talking
about
is
providing
recompense
for
the
very
same
things,
namely,
employment
related
retaliation
and
no
other
types
of
retaliation...
it
seems
to
me
that
once
you
narrow
your
argument
that
way
you've
abandoned
the
field
preemption
argument
and
you're
arguing
conflict.
justice
scalia
well,
if--
justice
scalia
--if
you're
arguing
field
preemption,
you're
saying
anything
that...
that
affects
safety
regulations.
justice
scalia
be
in
the
field
if
it
were
not
precisely
the
same
thing,
but
were
some
other
aspect
of
safety
regulation.
justice
scalia
yes,
it
does.
i
mean,
what...
the
theory
that
general
electric
is...
is
propounding
is
that
congress
was
not
only
concerned
that...
that
people
should
be
able
to
be
whistleblowers.
it
was
also
concerned
that
people
should
be
able
to
be
fired,
and
that
an...
and
that
an
employer
should
not
be
so
overwhelmingly
intimidated
by...
by
the
prospect
of
a...
of
a
massive
damages
suit
that
he
won't
get
rid
of
somebody
who
should
be
gotten
rid
of.
i
mean,
that's
their
theory.
so...
so
congress
established
this
law
which...
which
provides
for
both
ends
of
it.
whistleblowing,
plus
you
can
fire.
