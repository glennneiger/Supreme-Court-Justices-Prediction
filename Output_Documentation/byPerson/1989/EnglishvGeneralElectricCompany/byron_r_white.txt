justice
white
that
may
be,
but
do
you
think
that...
that
there
will
be
a
remedy
for
this
under
the
federal
act?
i
am
not
suggesting
that
would...
if
you
answer
yes,
i'm
not
saying
you'll
lose
your
case
at
all.
but
wasn't
there
an
action
for
this
same
course
of
conduct
under
the
federal
law?
justice
white
i
beg
your
pardon.
i'm
just
asking
for
your
view
under...
is
there
a
remedy
for
this
course
of
conduct
under
the
federal
statute?
justice
white
i
didn't
ask
that.
is
there
a
remedy
for
it?
justice
white
xxx
your
statement?
justice
white
xxx.
justice
white
the
juries
aren't?
justice
white
that
is
a
state
concern,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
not
only
that
but
that's...
there's
just...
there's
just
safety
preemption
under
the
atomic
energy
act.
justice
white
while
i've
got
you
interrupted,
is
the...
is
a
plaintiff
free
just
to
ignore
the
administrative
process
before
going
to
state
court?
justice
white
well,
that...
that
certainly
is
there
for
a
purpose,
i
suppose.
and
it's
there
for
a
safety
purpose,
isn't
it?
justice
white
it
always
will.
justice
white
but
that
issue
isn't
here,
is
it?
justice
white
yes,
i
would
say
that
there's
field
preemption
if
the...
if
the
state
purported
to
give
an
additional
remedy
for
a
violation
of
a
federal
safety
rule.
justice
white
well,
they
just...
they
say
here's
another
remedy,
an
additional
remedy,
for
violating
a
federal
safety
rule.
justice
white
well,
i--
justice
white
--yes?
justice
white
a...
there's
not
going
to
be
much
of
a
chance
for
retaliation
unless
somebody's
already
reported
something.
so--
justice
white
--but
that--
justice
white
--that
isn't
so
with
this
case,
is
it?
justice
white
in
a
field
occupation
what
kind
of
a
remedy
there
is
is
irrelevant,
isn't
it?
justice
white
well,
i...
but
that
certainly
doesn't
depend
on
how
adequate
the
federal
remedy
is.
justice
white
that's
right.
justice
white
mr.
phillips
has...
does
210
reach
any
whistleblowing
that
relates
to
anything
other
than
safety?
justice
white
well,
there
are
a
lot
of
rules
and
requirements
that
aren't
dealing
with
safety.
justice
white
but
there
are
some
that
aren't
safety
related,
aren't
there?
justice
white
isn't
that
true?
justice
white
so...
so
there
would
be
protection
under
210
for
a
whistleblower
who
reported
something
that
isn't
related
to
safety.
now,
i
don't
suppose
you
would
say
there's
field
preemption
there.
