mr.
m.
travis
payne
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
be
sharing
argument
this
morning
with
someone
from
the
solicitor
general's
office.
i
will
summarize
the
facts
and
address
the
nature
of
the
claim
before
you.
he
will
then
address
the
case
law
involved.
my
intention
is
to
reserve
five
minutes
of
our
allotted
time
for
rebuttal.
vera
english
worked
for
nearly
12
years
in
a
laboratory
at
general
electric's
nuclear
fuel
processing
plant.
she
did
analysis
to
assure
the
quality
of
material
placed
in
nuclear
fuel
rods.
over
the
years
she
made
a
number
of
complaints
concerning
safety
and
quality,
both
to
general
electric's
management
and
to
the
nrc.
as
a
result
of
those
complaints,
on
march
15,
1984,
she
was
removed
from
her
job
in
the
analytical
lab;
and
on
july
30th
of
that
same
year,
she
was
discharged
from
her
employment
with
general
electric.
we
have
alleged,
and
for
purposes
of
this
appeal
it
must
be
accepted
as
true,
that
the
actions
taken
against
mrs.
english
were
indeed
taken
in
retaliation
for
her
reports.
in
fact,
the
department
of
labor
administrative
law
judge
found
that
she
was
the
victim
of
retaliation.
he
also
found
that
ge's
witnesses
were
just
not
believable
in
attributing
the
actions
against
to
concerns
that
she
might
endanger
other
employees.
but
i
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we
are
not
here
relitigating
the
section
210
action
under
a
state
law
theory.
this
is
an
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
case,
and
the
issues
that
will
be
before
a
jury
at
a
trial
of
this
matter
are
significantly
different
from
those
considered
under
a
section
210
action.
under
north
carolina
law,
we
must
first
establish
that
the
conduct
directed
towards
mrs.
english
was
extreme
and
outrageous.
as
set
forth
quite
thoroughly
in
the
national
conference
of
state
legislators'
brief,
that
is
a
very,
very
high
standard,
and
only
the
most
egregious
situations
will
meet
it.
it
requires
considerably
more
than
merely
a
retaliatory
discharge.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
both
of
those
courts
found
in
response
to
the
12(b)(6)
motion
that
we
had
in
fact
asserted
all
of
the
elements
of
such
a
claim.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
yes.
there's
no
question
about
that.
that's
a...
a
specific
finding
in
judge
dupree's
ruling
in
the
district
court
and
clearly
affirmed
at
the
court
of
appeal.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
no,
your
honor.
what
we
are
alleging
is
a
period
of
some
four
and
a
half
months.
what
happened
in
this
case,
and
what
we
assert,
is
that
rather
than
merely
giving
mrs.
english
a
pink
slip
and
escorting
her
off
the
plant
on
march
15th,
they
instead
harassed
and
humiliated
her--
mr.
m.
travis
payne
--there's
absolutely
no
question
about
that.
in
fact,
the
discharge
is
a
minor
point.
it...
it
is
a
whole
series
of
elements
going
over
a
period
of
some
four
and
a
half
months
culminating
in
the
discharge.
but
absent
the
discharge,
95
percent
or
more
of
our
case
is
still
there.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
yes.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
that...
that
is
certainly--
mr.
m.
travis
payne
--part
of
it,
justice
scalia.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
in
fact,
it
is
our
contention
that
rather
than
just
fire
her,
if
ge
had
the
kinds
of
concerns
it's
tried
to
raise
about
safety,
about
legitimate
disciplinary
action,
they
would
have
fired
mrs.
english.
it
is
our
contention
that
rather
than
do
that,
they
made
an
example
out
of
her.
they
chose...
and
this
is
in
fact
another
aspect
of
the
intentional
infliction...
they
chose
basically
to
engage
in
a
psychological
assault
against
vera
english,
a
woman
that
they
knew
was
particularly
susceptible
to
that
form
of
attack.
before
the
administrative
judge,
one
of
the
primary
defenses
of
the
company
was
that
mrs.
english
was
a
highly
excitable,
nervous
woman.
that
is
the
woman
that
they
chose
to
subject
to
an
extended
period
of
humiliation
and
harassment.
we
submit
that
they
in
fact
knew
that
the
result
would
be
essentially
driving
mrs.
english
to
the
brink
of
a
complete
emotional
breakdown.
now
that...
that
in
fact
is
a
second
element
in
the
claim.
we
must
show
intent.
we
must
show
not
only
outrageous
conduct,
but
we
must
show
that
the
company
had
the
actual
intent
to
inflict
emotional
distress
on
mrs.
english.
that,
again,
is
a
fairly
heavy
burden
that
we
have
to
carry
at
trial.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
under
section
210...
and
i'll
say
that
on
the
remand,
which
there
is
the
separate
case
and
that
department
of
labor
case
has
been
appealed
to
the
fourth
circuit,
the
holding
of
the
administrative
judge
was
reversed
on
timeliness,
and
it
was
remanded.
and
this
may
be
what
justice
white
is
referring
to...
i
don't
know,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
that
there
was
some
indication
that
perhaps
prolonged
harassment
was
actionable.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
i
don't
think
there
is
an
adequate
remedy.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
there
is
somewhat
of
a
remedy
under
section
210.
there
are
compensatory
damages.
interesting
point
about
that,
it
appears
to
me
under
section
210
that
in
an
appropriate
case
the
secretary
might
be
able
to
award
consequential
damages
for
a
mere
retaliatory
discharge.
consequential
damages
perhaps
in
the
form
of
stress
and
humiliation.
and
in
that
case,
the
retaliatory
discharge
itself
might
not
rise
to
the
level
of
outrageous
conduct
intended
to
inflict
serious
emotional
distress.
so
it...
you
might
possibly
in
the
section
210
action
get
a
small
amount
of
damages,
where
if
you
tried
to
bring
the
state
tort
that
we're
here
before
you
on,
you
would
not
be
able
to
meet
the
elements.
so
it's
kind
of
a
mixed
situation.
i
would
say
that
a
remedy
under
section
210
for
these
types
of
claims
is
just
not
adequate
though.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
no.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
the
punitive
damages
only
come
into
play
under
section
210
if
the
employer
refuses
to
abide
by
the
secretary's
order,
and
if
the
secretary
must
then
seek
enforcement
in
the
district
court,
and
at
that
level
only
would
punitive
damages
be
available.
and
it's
really,
to
my
way
of
thinking,
not
clear
who
gets
those
punitive
damages,
the
secretary
that's
seeking
them.
they
are
not,
as
an
initial
matter,
available
to
the
complainant
in
a
section
210
action.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
punitive
damages
are
well-recognized
in
north
carolina.
it's
a
claim
that's
been
there
for
years.
they've
been
recognized
in
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
damages.
there's
no
question.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
justice
white,
there
is
no
statutory
limit.
i
will
tell
you
that
our
courts
are
fairly
hostile
to
those
form
of
damages
so
there's
a
real
world
limit.
but
in
terms
of
statutory
of
law--
mr.
m.
travis
payne
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
right.
this
court
recognized
in
farmer...
farmer
v.
the
carpenters
union...
that
when
employment
actions
are
carried
out
in
an...
a
particularly
abusive
fashion,
the
fundamental
interests
of
the
states
in
maintaining
order
and
preventing
abusive
conduct
is
not
preempted
by
federal
employment
law.
i
submit
to
that
mrs.
english's
case
presents
just
such
an
example
of
abusive
conduct
and
falls
well
within
the
doctrine
annunciated
by
this
court
in
farmer.
for
that
reason,
i
submit
that
the
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
should
be
reversed.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
thank
you.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
thank
you.
without
conceding
it,
i
will
say
to
you
that
even
if
you
determine
that
section
210
is
a
statute
affecting
nuclear
safety,
that
that
is
its
predominant
role...
even
if
you
conclude
that,
we
still
win
in
the
following
ways.
this
court
has
spoken
the
premier
field...
premier
examples
of
field
preemption
are
the
issues
dealt
with
in
sections
vii
and
viii
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
yet
this
court
has
addressed
those
issues
and
the
issue
of
state
court
preemption
in
two
very
different
ways.
they
have
in
fact...
this
court
has
in
fact
applied
the
field
preemption.
anything
that
the
states
do
is
preempted
in
the
situation
where
the
states
have
enacted
a
specific
narrow
state
statute
dealing
with
the
specific
matter
of
collective
bargaining.
garner
v.
teamsters
way
back
when,
a
more
recent
version
of
that,
gould
v.
wisconsin.
but
then
there
are
the
nlra
cases
where
the
state
law
at
issue
is
a
state
law
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
labor
relations,
is
in
fact
one
of
general
concerns
of
the
state,
such
as
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
when
this
court
has
confronted
a
state
law
of
general
application,
a
state
law
that
applies
separate
and
apart
from
the
field
of
labor
relations,
it
has
in
fact
applied
the
conflict
preemption.
i
think,
justice
scalia,
your
point
is
well
taken.
we
look
at
united
auto
workers
v.
russell.
we
look
at,
in
fact,
farmer
v.
the
carpenters.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
justice
rehnquist,
you're
going
to
have
help
me.
as
i
recall
luick,
that
was
a
matter
alleging
bad
faith
and
it
was
covered
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
is
that...
is
that
the
case?
mr.
m.
travis
payne
your
honor,
i
think
that
that
particular
state
law
is...
is
not
a
state
law
grounded
in
the
same
history
of
things
like
the
violence
considered
by
this
court
in
the
uaw
v.
russell--
mr.
m.
travis
payne
--of
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress.
mr.
m.
travis
payne
i
think
to
some
extent
this
court
has
in
fact
made
almost
those
sort
of
balancing
determinations
when
it
looks
at...
there
is...
and,
in
fact,
rice,
which
the
respondent
relies
significantly,
sets
forth
that
when
it
is
a
matter
that
has
been
historically
covered
by
the
states,
there's
a
very,
very
heavy
burden
to
preempt.
we
submit
that
burden
exists
here
and
we
submit
it
has
not
been
met.
the
case
of
farmer
in
fact
was
never
addressed
by
respondent
in
its
argument.
we
submit,
contrary
to
the
finding
of
the
district
court,
contrary
to
the
argument
of
respondent,
that
all
of
the
actions
against
mrs.
english
are
not
just
terms
and
conditions.
farmer
clearly
said
that
even
if
many
of
the
elements
of
the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
claim
are
terms
and
conditions,
if
they
are
carried
out
in
a
particularly
abusive
manner...
that's
the
language
of
the
farmer
decision,
particularly
abusive
manner...
they
are
still
actionable
under
the
state
law
theory.
we
have
here
and
we
have
alleged
a
particularly
abusive
manner.
the
proposal
put
forward
by
general
electric
to
you,
i
submit,
has
an
absurd
result.
employees
who
come
forward
with
information
about
possible
problems
at
a
plant,
the
very
employees
who
were
doing
what
is
socially
responsible,
doing
the
right
thing,
indeed,
the
very
employees
that
congress
was
trying
to
encourage
to
come
forward,
those
employees
when
they
do
that
are
now
penalized.
they
don't
have
the
remedies
available
to
them.
i
submit
to
you
that
that
result
makes
not
sense
and--
mr.
m.
travis
payne
--two
things,
justice
scalia.
we
have
all
been
talking
about
what
congress
did.
there
is
absolutely...
and
respondent
did
this
a
lot...
there
is
absolutely
nothing
anywhere
to
show
that
congress
made
any
affirmative
decisions
about
section
210
other
than
to
pass
it.
all
of
the
elements
were
in--
mr.
m.
travis
payne
--thank
you,
your
honor.
