mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
first
address
ge's
contention
that
petitioner's
claim
intrudes
on
the
federal
nuclear
safety
field
and
then
turn
to
ge's
contention
that
it
conflicts
with
specific
provisions
of
section
210.
as
this
court
stated
in
pacific
gas
&
electric,
congress
has
decided
that
the
federal
government,
and
not
the
states,
should
regulate
the
radiological
safety
aspects
involved
in
the
construction
and
operation
of
a
nuclear
plant.
i
want
to
make
clear
that
the
federal
government
believes
that
such
regulation
is
solely
a
federal
matter.
however,
like
the
courts
below,
we
do
not
think
that
petitioner's
claim
intrudes
on
the
federal
field.
nothing
about
her
claim
is
dependent
on
the
fact
that
she
worked
at
a
nuclear
facility,
and
ge
needs
change
no
aspect
of
its
nuclear
program
in
order
to
avoid
suits
such
as
petitioner's.
it
need
only
change
its
labor
practices.
as
the
district
court
said
in
this
case,
with
respect
to
the
field
preemption
issue,
nuclear
safety
is
only
tangential
to
this
case.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right.
we
think
that
it
supplements
rather
than
supplants.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
let...
let...
let
me
try
to
explain
that.
that's
really
a
conflict
preemption
problem,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it
wouldn't--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--a
conflict
preemption
matter
as
opposed
to
a
field
preemption
matter.
for
instance,
one
could
suppose
a
state
law
action
in
which
reinstatement
was
a
possible
remedy.
one
could
also
suppose
that
in
a
section
210
action,
or
in
a
proceeding
before
the
nuclear
regulatory
commission,
it
had
been
determined
that
the
particular
employee
had
committed
safety
violations.
now,
in
that
situation,
we
would
contend
there
would
be
an
actual
conflict
between
a
state
remedy
of
reinstatement,
for
instance,
and
the
federal
interest
in
protecting
the
field
of
nuclear
safety.
we
would
be
on
the
other
side
in
such
a
case.
but
that
is
not
this
case,
and
the
difference,
let
me
reiterate,
because--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--no,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
why
i
say
i'm
not
sure
it
really
depends
on
section
210.
even
before
section
210
had
been
enacted
24
years
after
the
atomic
energy
act
was
enacted,
i
am
confident
that
we
would
argue
that
conflict
preemption
principles
barred
reinstatement
of
a...
of
a
serious
violator
of
nuclear
safety
rules
under
state
law.
that--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes,
and
in
that
case
there's
a
real
conflict
between...
would
be
a
real
conflict
between
the
state
law
and
federal
law--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--yes,
that's
right.
the
field
congress
has
occupied
is
the...
is
the
nuclear
safety
field
i've
used
as
a
shorthand--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we
don't
think
that
there
is
any
sort
of
exhaustion
requirement
or
anything.
perhaps
your
question--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that
is
true
and,
as
ge
has
pointed
out,
it
is
the
case
that
the
filing
of
a
whistleblower
claim
will
in
some
circumstances
alert
the
nrc
to
a
safety
violation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
of
course,
in
this
case
it
didn't
because
she'd
already
complained
to
the
nrc.
and...
and
of
course,
in
most
whistleblower
cases
the
employee
has
already
blown
the
whistle
so
that
it's
only
in
the
sort
preemptive
retaliation
cases,
if
you
will,
that
the
nrc
wouldn't
already
know
about
the
underlying
violation.
in
those
cases,
we...
we
have
stated--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
it's...
no,
it's
not
involved
in
this
case,
as
i
say,
because
mrs.
english
had
complained
to
the
nrc
already.
in
short,
we...
we...
we
see
a
problem
there.
we
think
ge
greatly
overstates
the
extent
of
that
problem.
ge's
argument
with
respect
to
field
preemption
runs
as
follows.
section
210
has
some
relationship
to
the
field
of
nuclear
safety,
and
her
claim
overlaps
to
some
extent
with
the
section
210
claim.
but
that
overlap
does
not
establish
intrusion
on
the
federal
field
because
section
210,
as
i
indicated
briefly
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
is,
in
our
view,
primarily
an
employee
protection
statute,
as
its
title
states.
before
it
was
enacted,
the
nrc
already
prohibited
nuclear
employers
from
retaliating
against
whistleblowers.
section
210
just
added
a
remedy.
and
in
some
cases,
as
in
this
case,
no
wrongful
discharge
action
would
have
been
available
under
state
law.
so
a
supplemental
remedy
was
needed,
at
least
in
some
states.
in
addition,
section
210
is
administered
by
the
department
of
labor,
not
by
the
nrc,
which
we
think
emphasizes
the
fact
that
it's
primarily
an
employee
protection
statute
and...
and
not
a
nuclear
safety
statute.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
there's
no
question.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
there's
no
question
that
it
has
nuclear
safety
aspects
as
well.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
is--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we
don't
think
you
have
to
decide
whether
section
210
is
a
labor
provision
or
a
safety
provision.
we
think
you
have
to
decide
whether
petitioner's
claim
intrudes
on
the
federal
nuclear
safety
field.
ge...
ge's
argument
is
simply
that
because
her
claim
overlaps
to
some
extent
with
section
210,
which
in
turn
overlaps
to
some
extent
with
nuclear
safety
matters,
it's
preempted.
but,
you're
right.
i'd
like
to
return...
the
real
question
is
whether
her
claim
intrudes
onto
the
nuclear
safety
field.
the
federal
government
does
not
think
that
it
does.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
and
i
would
return
to
the
district
court's
characterization
of
the...
of
the
nuclear
safety
issue
in
this
case
as
being
only
tangential
or
in
the
background.
i
think
ge's
concession
with
respect
to
the
battery
hypothetical
that
mrs.
english
raised
in
her...
in
her
brief
is
instructive
in
this
respect.
they
concede
that
she
would
not
be
barred
from
going
forward
with
a
battery
claim
if
they
had
physically
assaulted
her.
now,
it's
true
that
a
battery
claim
doesn't
overlap
with
a
section
210
claim.
however,
with
respect
to
their
effect
on
the
nuclear
field,
there's
no
difference.
both
would
arise
out
of
retaliation
for
making
a
nuclear
safety
complaint,
and
both
could
result
in
extensive
damages
being
levied
against
the
operator
of
a
nuclear
facility.
but
in
our
view,
neither
intrudes
on
the
federal
field
to
the
extent
that
preemption
is
warranted.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
if
instead
of,
as
they
allege,
psychologically
harassing
her
for
four
and
a
half
months,
they
had
instead,
or
in
addition,
had
someone
beat
her
up.
in
our
view,
this
is
an
easier
case
than
both
pacific
gas
&
electric
and--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well,
i--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that
hypothetical
is,
of
course,
quite
troubling
because--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--you
had
it
framed
exactly--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--you've...
you've
established
a
special
rule
for
nuclear
facilities.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
might
well
have
some
trouble
with
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
think
we
would
say
it
would--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--since
it's
aimed
at
that
field.
but,
of
course,
a
regular
battery
action,
is
not.
just
as
a
regular
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--the
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress
wasn't?
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
and
that's
why
we
say
it's
not
preempted,
or
that's
one
of
the
reason
we
say--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--unless
it
has
an
effect
and
except
to
the
extent
that
it
actually
intrudes
on
the
federal
field.
if,
for
example,
as
i
hypothesized,
a
nuclear
safety
violator
was
ordered
to
be...
excuse
me...
reinstated,
we
would
argue
for
preemption
in
such
a
case.
there
would
be
a
real
conflict
there.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no.
no,
justice
scalia.
if...
if...
if
a
state
passed
a
law
that
really
involved
a
nuclear
field
and
was
supportive
of
the
federal
goal,
a
whistleblower
statute...
well,
not
a
whistleblower
statute...
a
regulation
designed
solely
to
make
nuclear
plants
safer...
it
is,
of
course,
part
of
the
nrc's
purpose
to
make
nuclear
plants
safer.
but
because
that's
a
federal
field,
a
state
law,
even
one
that
doesn't
conflict,
even
one
that
promotes
the
federal
goal--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--well--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i'll...
i'll
concede
that
if
you
look
at
it
that
way,
you
could
always
find
field
preemption
to
be
a
conflict.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
if
it
was
aimed
at
nuclear
safety,
of
course.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i
stress
that...
the
nuclear
safety
because
in
the...
in
the
goodyear
atomic
case
this
court
upheld
an
additional
remedy
under
a
worker's
compensation
statute--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that
was...
that
was
on
account
of
violation
of
a
safety
regulation.
so
i'd
say
we
would...
we
would
say,
of
course,
if
it
was
a
nuclear...
if
a
state
did
something
particularly
aimed
at
the
nuclear
field,
yes,--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we
would
argue
for
preemption
in
that
case.
with
respect
to
pacific
gas
&
electric,
ge
argues
that
that
case
is
distinguishable
because
the
state
was
regulating
economic
matters
rather
than...
than
labor
matters.
we
think
what
is
most
significant
in
that
case
was
that
the
state
was
not
regulating
nuclear
safety
matters.
it
says
that
silkwood
is
distinguishable
because
there
was
some
legislative
history
indicating
that
congress
assumed
that
the
persons
who
had
been
injured
by
exposure
to
radiation
could
pursue
state
remedies.
we
agree
with
the
first
circuit
in
the
norris
v.
lumbermen's
case
that
it's
reasonable
to
suppose
that
congress
intended
to
supplement
remedies
to
allow
whistleblowers,
as
well
as
those
injured
by
exposure
to
radiation,
to
pursue
claims
such
as
petitioner's
as
well.
let
me
make
just
one
point
with
respect
to...
or
further
point
with
respect
to
conflict
preemption.
the
court
should
keep
in
mind
that
all
three
of
the
subparts
of
section
210
that
ge
focuses
on
in...
in
that
part
of
its
brief
are
virtually
identical
to
provisions
in
six
other
environmental
statutes
where
state
regulation
is
specifically
contemplated
by
the
federal
statute.
thus,
none
of
the
three
statutes...
none
of
the
three
subparts,
either
individually
or
in
combination,
inherently
conflicts
with
concurrent
state
regulation.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
i
have
nothing
further.
