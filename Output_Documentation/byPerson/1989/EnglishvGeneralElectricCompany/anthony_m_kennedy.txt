justice
kennedy
was
the
retaliatory
discharge
one
of
the
elements
that
you
included
in
alleging
intentional
infliction
of
emotional
distress?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
i
mean,
i
take
it
your
position
is
the
same
if
we...
if
you
excise
from
your
complaint
or
if
you
excise
from
the
trial
of
the
case
the
fact
of
the
discharge,
i
take
it
you
still
can
proceed
with
your
cause
of
action?
justice
kennedy
does
the...
does
210
require
discharge
of
an
employee
who's
violated
a
safety
regulation?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
there's
not
really
a
square
conflict
in
the
case
you
suppose
so
the
state
ordered
reinstatement.
