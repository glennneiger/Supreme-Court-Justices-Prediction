justice
kennedy
i...
i
take
it
that
a
sentence
enhancement
statute
enhancing
the
sentence
if
a
bank
robber
carries
a
gun,
in
your
view,
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
the
jury?
justice
kennedy
well,
do
you--
justice
kennedy
--do
you
say
then
that
this
is
an
element
of
the
offense?
justice
kennedy
well,
every...
everywhere
in
the
law
does
the
jury
have
to
be
separately
instructed
on
the
difference
between...
two
different
charges,
felony
murder
or...
or
murder
by
the
perpetration
of
the
defendant?
justice
kennedy
mr....
mr.
ford,
how
do
recidivism
statutes
work?
do
you...
do
you
know
if...
if
it's
for
the
court
to
determine
whether
the
offender
is
a
habitual
offender?
justice
kennedy
well,
of
course,
it...
it
does...
it
does
seem
to
me
that
this
jury
found
the
defendant
guilty
of
murder
as
specified
in
the
statute
and
that
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
for
finality
purposes
was
complete
when
the
jury
was
instructed
on
the
elements
of
the
offense
without
reference
to
the
aggravating
and
mitigating
character...
character
of
the
act.
justice
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
under
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
there
are
any
number
of...
of
different
factual
circumstances
that
the
trial
judge
finds
on
sentence.
the
jury
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
it.
justice
kennedy
you
mean
the
more
facts
the
judge
can
find,
the...
the
less
need
there
is
for
the
fact-finder
under
your
theory?
justice
kennedy
or
your
other
issue,
i
suppose.
justice
kennedy
well,
is...
in
your
position...
is
it
your
position
that
this
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense?
justice
kennedy
well,
is
it
a
matter
for
state
law
to
define
what's
an
element
of
defense
when
a
jury...
when
the
issue
is
whether
you're
entitled
to
a
federal
jury
trial?
justice
kennedy
well,
part
of
the
sentencing
process?
justice
kennedy
the...
the
allegation
that
it
was
the
defendant
that
pulled
the
trigger
here,
what
particular
part
of
the
code
does
that
come
under?
is
that
a
specific
aggravating
offense
in
a
single
clause?
justice
kennedy
that
was
relevant
to
the
difference
between
a
felony
murder
and
a
murder
under...
a
first-degree
murder
of
another
type
under
the
statute?
justice
kennedy
well,
then
why
isn't
that
an
element
of
the
offense?
justice
kennedy
if
it's
not
an
aggravating
factor,
what
is
it
then?
and
if
it's
not
an
element
of
the
offense,
then
what
is
it?
justice
kennedy
was...
was
the
fact
that
he
pulled
the
trigger
relevant
in
the
judge's
aggravation/mitigation
analysis?
justice
kennedy
and...
and
how
do
you
distinguish
this
from
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
in
his
separate
opinion
in
which
he
said
that
it's
like
an
assault
and
then
the
further
inquiries
whether
it's
assault
with
intent
to
kill
or
assault
within
the
course
of
a
rape?
justice
kennedy
how
do
we
know
the
difference
by
looking
to
the
face
of
the
statute?
justice
kennedy
an...
an
element
of
the
defense
and
a
factor
that's
used
in
sentencing?
