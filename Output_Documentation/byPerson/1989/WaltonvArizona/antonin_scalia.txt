that...
that
is
different
from...
from
just
in
the
course
of
a
robbery
suddenly
shooting
someone.
i
mean,
i...
i
suppose
holding
someone
hostage
in...
as
occurred
in
this
case,
debating
with
your
accomplices
whether
you
will
kill
him
or
not
while
he's
lying
there
on
the
ground...
i
suppose
that
is
something
in
addition
to
merely
killing
somebody
in
the
course
of
a
robbery,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
is
that
whether
or
not
the...
the
defendant
knew
that
and
intended
that?
justice
scalia
because
here...
here
that
obviously
occurred.
the--
justice
scalia
--victim
was
blinded
by...
by
the
shot
in
the
head
and
wandered
around
in
the
desert
for
five
days
before
he
finally
died
of
starvation,
as
i
gather.
justice
scalia
you
are
saying
it's
superfluous
if...
if
you're...
you're
saying
you
wouldn't
really
have
needed
that
anyway.
justice
scalia
but
it's
narrow
enough
without
the
cruel,
heinous
circumstance
narrowing.
justice

rather,
if
you
just
left
it
to
the
judge
and
didn't
specify
what
particular
criteria
would
determine
the
severity
of
the
sentence...
let's
say
you
leave
it
to
the
judge
to
pick
between
a
fine
and
imprisonment,
which
also
differs
in
the
terms
"life,
liberty
or
property"...
it's
the
difference
between
property
and
liberty...
you
could
leave
it
entirely
to
the
judge.
so
long
as
you
don't
specify
how
it
will
make
the
difference,
it
would
be
perfectly
okay
to
have
the
judge
make
factual
findings,
on
the
basis
of
which
he
makes
that
judgment.
justice
scalia
but
your
position
is
that
if
the
state
says
that
you
can
only
give
imprisonment
if
you
find
a
certain
fact,
then
it
has
to
come
out
of
the
sentencing
judge
and
go
to
the
jury.
even
in
a
noncapital
case.
justice
scalia
why
does
it
cease
to
be
a
sentencing
determination
simply
because
you
specify?
