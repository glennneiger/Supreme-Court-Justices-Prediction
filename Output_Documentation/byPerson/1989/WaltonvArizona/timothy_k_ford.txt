mr.
timothy
k.
ford
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
three
issues
regarding
the
constitutionality
of
aspects
of
arizona's
death
sentencing
statute.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
briefly
addressing
the
last
of
those
that
is
discussed
in
our
briefs,
the
constitutionality
of
the
provision
of
arizona
law
that
makes
murder
a
capital
crime
if
it
is
committed
in
an
especially
heinous,
cruel
or
depraved
fashion.
that
issue
is
before
the
court,
of
course,
in
another
case,
lewis
v.
jeffers,
which
will
be
argued
i
believe
immediately
after
the
recess
the
court
is
about
to
take.
and
it
is
our
submission,
as
it
is
the
submission
of
the
respondent
in
lewis,
that
the
case
is
directly
controlled
by
this
court's
decision
in
maynard
v.
cartwright,
holding
almost
identical
language
in
the
oklahoma
statute
to
have
failed
to
control
sentencing
discretion.
the...
professor
rosen,
who
wrote
the
seminal
article
on
this...
it
was
relied
on
in
maynard
and
also
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
en
banc
and
the
adamson
case,
have
also
reviewed
the
arizona
statute,
its
application,
in
great
detail,
and
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
way
in
which
it
can
be
distinguished
from
the
oklahoma
statute
in
maynard.
since
adamson,
of
course,
the
arizona
court
has
gone
even
farther.
this
case
was
decided
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
after
adamson,
and
that
court
continued
to
take
steps
to
stretch
the
breadth
of
this
aggravating
circumstance
even
to
greater
lengths.
in
this
case,
affirming
a
trial
judge's
finding
of
the
aggravating
circumstance
which
was
unadorned
by
any
explanation
of
what
the
trial
judge's
understanding
of
what
the
circumstance
meant,
which
followed
arguments
by
the
prosecution
with
regard
to
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
which
the
arizona
supreme
court
rejected.
and
in
this
case,
the
arizona
court
took
the
final
step
in
a
series
of
decisions
by
which
it
ultimately
said
that
the
fear
of
a
robbery
victim,
a
person
who
is
not
necessarily
even
going
to
be
the
victim
of
a
homicide,
the
uncertainty
of...
as
to
the
person's
fate
is
sufficient
to
constitute
suffering
which
is
sufficient
to
constitute
cruelty,
which
is
sufficient
to
make
out
the
statute
and
qualify
a
defendant
in
that
kind
of
a
case
for
a
sentence
of
death.
and
in
this
case,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--well,
i
can't
refrain,
justice
scalia,
from
pointing
out
that
there
isn't,
of
course,
any
testimony
that
such
a
debate
occurred.
that...
that
debate
is
a
product
of
the
rhetoric
of
the
arizona
attorney
general
and
the
arizona
supreme
court.
according
to
the
witness,
the
discussion
was
over
what
the
person
would
be
tied
up
with.
but,
again,
to
take
the
court's
hypothetical,
there
are
always
those
facts
that
can
be
said
to
distinguish
one
homicide
from
another,
to
constitute
as...
cruelty
because
every
homicide,
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
in
maynard,
is...
could
be
said
by
a
reasonable
person
to
be
cruel.
you
can
always
find
a
fact
in
any
case
that
says,
well,
that's
a
cruel
fact.
that's
different
than
some
other
cases.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
well,
if
the
arizona
supreme
court
had
said
that
discussing
whether
or
not
to
shoot
a
person
in...
in
his
presence
was
an
aggravating
circumstance...
and
that
was
the
definition
of
this
aggravating
circumstance...
that
would
be,
of
course,
a
different
case.
they
never
said
that--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--until
this
case,
and
i'm
not
sure
they
said
it
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
well,
if
they
did
say
it
in
this
case,
the
point...
our
point
again...
remains,
justice
white,
that
they
never
said
it
in
any
case
before
and
in
many
other
cases
where
it
occurred
before
that
was--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--well,
of
course,
and
that's
what
the
oklahoma
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
in
maynard
as
well.
and
what
this
court
said
was
that
that
doesn't
satisfy
the
requirement
of
furman
and
godfrey,
that
in...
furman
and
godfrey
require
that
a
definition
of
some
sort
be
fashioned
that
then
constrains
the
discretion
of
sentencers
after
that
fact.
and
that's
never
happened
in
arizona.
the--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--yes.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
that's
correct.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
exactly
what
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
did
in
maynard
and
in
actually
in
some
ways
worse
because
in
a
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
maynard
we
had
a
jury
instruction...
we
knew
what
that
jury
was
told
constituted
heinous,
atrocious
or
cruel.
in
this
situation,
because
we
don't
have...
we
have
bench
trials
in
arizona,
and
that's
an
issue
i
want
to
come
in
a
second...
we
don't
know
what
definition
was
used.
the
trial
judge
never
said,
i'm
applying
this
definition.
and
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
said
in
the
past
and
very
critically
in
the
rumsey
case
that
came
to
this
court
that
it
is
not
the
sentencing
body,
that
it
is
a
reviewing
body,
and
the
discretion
that
is
to
be
confined
i
think
is
the
discretion
of
the
sentencing
body
that
can
be
controlled
by
rules
set
in
advance
and
not
just
changed
on
a
case-by-case
basis
as
cases
are
analogized
to
facts
that
may
have
been
incidental
in
a
prior
crime
and
then
become
the
sine
qua
non
of
this
factor.
i
would
like
to
spend
some
time
talking
about
the
first
issue
in
this
case.
it
is
a
classic
conflict
between
the
expansion
of
judicial
power
at
the
expense
of
the
traditional
role
of
one
of
our
democratic
institutions,
the
criminal
trial
jury.
the
state
of
arizona
here
is
claiming
that
it
may
transfer
the
most
basic
core
functions
of
the
trial
jury
to
a
judge...
take
it
away
from
the
jury
where
it
has
been
for
at
least
300
years
in
english
and
american
law,
by
simply
changing
its
label.
by
calling
it
an
aggravating
circumstance.
and
if
that
can
be
done
with
the
facts
that
are
in
their
present
statute
and
any
fact...
they've
given
no
standard
by
which
this
court
would
say
what
facts
can
be
changed
by
that
labeling
devise
and
what
cannot.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
this
is
a
sixth
amendment
issue,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
fourteenth
amendment
as
well
because
the
specific
intent
of
the
framers
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
1791
and
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
1868,
as
evidenced
by
the
commentators,
as
is
evidenced
by
the
words
of
justice
jay
three
years
after
the
sixth
amendment
was
written,
as
evidenced
by
the
colonial
and
english
history
of
what
a
jury
was,
everyone
agreed
ad
quaestionem
facti
non
respondent
judices...
judges
could
not
answer
question
of
fact.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
well,
the
hildwin
case,
your
honor,
i
think
takes
us
right
to
the
threshold
of
what
the
framers
were
trying
to
preserve
for
the
jury.
but
the
hildwin
decision,
as
i
understand
it,
involved
a
unanimous
recommendation
by
a
jury
under
florida
law
that
implied
that
that
jury
had
unanimously
found
at
least
one
and
probably
many
aggravating
circumstances.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
well,
the
trial
judge
has
the
final
say
on
sentencing.
and
this
court
in
spaziano
held
that
judges
may
have
the
final
say
on
sentencing,
as
judges
have
in
many
jurisdictions
for
hundreds
of
years.
but
on
findings
of
fact
that
make
a
person
eligible
for
this
sentence,
the
judges
in
england
and
america
have
never
had
that
authority.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
well,
the
judge
in
florida...
as
i
understand
florida
law,
in
the--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--okay.
well,
as
i...
as
the
court
wrote
about
florida
law...
and
i
thought
the
court
was
quite
careful
in
many
of
the
things
it
said
and
how
it
addressed
florida
law--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--what
cabana
involves
is...
as
the
court...
i
reread
cabana
last
night
and
it
explains
very
carefully
that
the
finding
of
fact
that's
involved
there
is--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--and...
and
as
the--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--because
that
requirement
was
imposed
by
the
eighth
amendment
and...
by
the
federal
courts
as
a
matter
of
their
proportionality
review
under
the
eighth
amendment.
that
traditional
judicial
function.
and
this
was
a
benchmark
that
courts
were
to
use
as--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--if
the
fact
is
eligible--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--that's
correct.
but
the
fact...
the
eligibility
is
established
by
law.
the
due
process
clause
says
no
person
shall
be
deprived
of
life
without
due
process
of
law.
in
our
federal
system
the
states,
by
their
statutes,
say
what
is
necessary
for
a
deprivation
of
life
or
a
deprivation
of
liberty.
this
court,
and
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
in
this
context
and
others,
then
looks
to
the
process
by
which
those
facts
are
found
to
see
whether
the
due
process
clause
was
complied
with.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
certainly
not
under
mcmillan
v.
pennsylvania.
if,
as
in
mcmillan,
number
one,
the
state
said...
and
i
thought
this
was
an
interesting
part
of
mcmillan
i
had
overlooked
when
we
wrote
our
reply
brief...
the
state
of
pennsylvania
said
this
is
not
an
element.
arizona
has
never
said
that.
that
doesn't
appear
in
this
case
at
all.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
number
two--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--this
is
necessarily
an
element
of
the
offense
as
that
term
is
understood
everywhere
in
the
law.
it
is
a
fact
about
the
offense
itself.
there
must
be--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--i...
as
i
understand
it,
juries
do
in
arizona
and
everywhere
have
to
be
instructed
on
those.
they
don't
necessarily
have
to
specify
which
they
found,
but
they
must
be
instructed
that
they
have
to
find
all
of
those
elements
that
make
up
one
of
those
two
theories.
and
that's
very
much
what
i
understand
the
court
in
hildwin
to
have
said.
the
jury
in
hildwin
was
able
to
recommend
death
unanimously
as
it
did
because
it
found
some
aggravating
circumstances.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
that's
correct.
and
the
court
has
to
identify
those
circumstances,
as
i
think
justice
stevens
explained
in
his
barclay
opinion
and
the
spaziano
opinion
with
regard
to
what
florida
law
is
about.
those
findings
are
designed
and
were
put
in
the
florida
statute
for
judicial
review.
they...
by
statute
they
are
not
exclusive
factors.
by
statute
you
can
have
non--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--i
think
not,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
what
i'm
talking
about
are
the
terms,
as
these
terms
would
have
been
understood
in
1791
and
in
1868.
i'm
talking
about
the
term--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--well,
they...
though
that
particular
phrase
wasn't
used...
i'm
not
sure
the
phrase
"elements
of
the
offense"
was
used
at
that
time.
but
what
was
known
is
that
certain
facts
were
prerequisite
to
a
deprivation
of
life
or
liberty
and
that
those
facts
that
the
law...
the
statutes...
made
prerequisite
to
a
deprivation
of
life
or
liberty
were
for
the
jury.
now,
the
facts
that
may
have
had
to
do
with
what
sentence
should
be
imposed,
such
as--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--well,
i
think
not.
i
think
that
i'm
arguing
that
if...
hildwin,
certainly,
mr.
chief
justice,
could
be
extended
logically
to
incorporate
the
arizona
statute.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
but
if
it
does,
then--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--it
differs
because
the
statute
is
written
differently,
because
the
statute
talks
about
these
factors
as
considerations
and
the
determination
is
whether
they
are
sufficient.
that
they
are
not
sufficient...
a
finding
of
one
aggravating
circumstance
is
not
a
sufficient
condition
for
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
in
florida.
the...
the
fact
that
it's
a
necessary
condition
is
a--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--judicial
one
that--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--yes--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--because
an
element
of
the
offense
is
a
discrete
atomic
sort
of...
that's
why
i
think
maybe
we
call
them
elements.
that's
where
the
metaphor
may
have
come
from.
it
is...
once
it
is
proven,
you
are
eligible.
it
is
the
factual
prerequisite
to
the
determination
of
punishment
that
may
be
made
by
a
judge.
but
the
factual
eligibility
is
concretely
defined
in
the
law
of
arizona,
concretely
defined
in
the
law
of
homicide
throughout
the
country
and
in
the
very
many
other
states
that
don't
have
this
kind
of
a
provision
in
arizona.
in
florida,
the...
the
facts
are...
are
quite
distinctly
described
as
considerations.
and
the
question
is
whether
there
is
a
sufficient
number.
and
they
are
balancing
elements
and
they
are
not
something
that
is...
is
set
out
by
the--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--no.
the
jury
has
to
make
the
findings
that
make
the
person
eligible
by
law
for
the
imposition
of
the
sentence.
once
this
judge--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--well,
as
i
understand,
the
way
that
the
florida
statute
is
written,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
those
factors
are
there
to
be
identified
so
that
appellate
courts
can
look
and
avoid
arbitrariness
by
saying,
here
are
the
factors
that
are...
were
in
this
case;
we're
looking
at
comparative
cases;
we
have
reasons
stated
on
the
record.
those
kinds
of
reasons
for
judicial
opinions,
very
much
like
the
reasons
of
the
defendant's...
the
enmund
factors
that
the
court
said
that
could
be
found
by
a
judge
in
cabana
are
not
the
kinds
of
core
elements...
and
i
guess
my
point
is
that,
sure,
the
line
is
a
thin
one
here,
but
if
you...
there
is
no
line
whatsoever
between
the
arizona
statute
and
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
in
mcmillan
where
the
states
say
the
crime
is
assault
and
it's
an
aggravating
factor,
that
it
was
a
homicide
or
the
person
died
or
it
was
premeditate
or
it
was
intent
to
rape--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--they
have
the
traditional
first-degree
murder.
but
the
arizona
legislature
has
decided
that
absent
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
certain
discrete
limited
factors
by
evidence
which
is
admissible
under
the
rules
of
criminal
procedure,
another
difference
between
that
and
florida,
that
is
a...
both
a
necessary
and
sufficient
condition
for
imposition
of
the
death
penalty...
also
different
than
florida...
and
it
shifts
the
burden
of
proof
to
show...
to
the
defendant
to
show
that
he
should
not
be
sentenced
to
death.
now,
if
that
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense,
i
don't
know
what
is,
and
the
state
of
arizona
has
never
answered
the
question
what
is
in
the
many
arguments
we've
had
over
this.
there
is
no
other
line
that
anyone
has
suggested
could
be
drawn.
and
this
line
was
fought
over.
it
was
put
in
the
constitution
twice
because
of
just
this
kind
of
usurpation
by
the
crown
in
england
under
the
stuarts
where
they
tried
to
take
away
from
juries
the
power,
say,
in
william
penn's
case,
to
determine
whether
or
not
the...
the
facts
were
true.
and
they
tried
to
penalize
juries
for
returning
false
verdicts.
the
cornerstone
basis
of
the
right
to
jury
trial
was
that
the
judge
could
not
say
that
the
fact
was
false.
and
if
the
judge
can
say
that
the
fact
is
false,
why
shouldn't
juries
be
held
in
contempt?
why
shouldn't
verdicts
be
directed,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
in
his
carrella
opinion?
this
is
the
bedrock
definition
of
the
jury
trial
that
was
never
in
debate.
the
debate
in
17...
in
the
18th
century
was
whether
or
not
juries
should
decide
the
law,
whether
or
not
juries
should
sentence.
as
justice
white's
opinions
in--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--they
vary
in
many
ways.
the...
there
are...
most
statutes
that
i'm
aware
of,
including
arizona's,
have
a
jury
decide
whether
or
not
the
person
is
a
habitual
offender.
there
are
statutes,
and
there
are
a
variety
of
these
things,
justice
kennedy.
and
the
court
has
said,
as
it
did
in
mcmillan,
there
may
not
be
a
bright
line
here,
but
the...
most
cases...
statutes
that
i
know
of
are
like
the
one
in
mcmillan
where
you're
not
creating
eligibility
for
a
qualitatively
new
kind
of
punishment;
you
are
simply
raising
a
minimum
term.
you're
doing
the
kind
of
thing
a
parole
board
might
do
later
on
because
the
legislature
has
determined
that
you're
eligible
to
have
your
liberty
deprived
up
to
a
length
of
time
based
on
these
other
facts,
and
this
is
just
an
additional
fact
that
may
raise
the
minimum.
in
mcmillan
the
court
was
very
explicit
in
distinguishing
that
from...
and
especially
from
this
where
you're
talking
about
a
qualitatively
different
punishment,
one
that
is
described
by
a
different
word
in
the
fourteenth
amendment.
and
you
can't
get
there,
under
state
law,
unless
these
facts
are
proven.
and
if...
and
those,
i
think,
are
very
different
kinds
of
facts
than...
than
most
recidivism
statutes.
now,
the
when
the
oregon
supreme
court
struck
down
its
statute--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--he
was
convicted
of
first-degree
murder.
he
was
not
yet
eligible
to
the
sentence
of
death.
under
arizona
statute,
to
be
eligible
for
a
sentence
of
death,
the
state
had
to
additionally
prove
facts
by
competent
evidence
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
a
specific
listed
number
of...
of
discrete
facts
and
then
the
burden
would
shift
to
show
that...
to
the
defendant
to
show
his
life
should
be
spared.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
that's
correct.
and
the
congress
has
carefully
refrained
from
enacting
this
kind
of
a
statute
that
makes
an
exclusive
list
of
factors
describe
a
particular
sentence.
the
list
of
factors
are
factors.
the
judge
can
depart
from
those
factors
by
giving
reasons.
they
are
not
exclusive.
they
are
not
limited,
and
they
do
not
change
the--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--the...
when...
yes,
exactly,
because
that's
what
the
court
said
in
spaziano.
when
you're
talking
about
sentencing,
you're
talking
about...
and
the
court
has
said
in
ramos...
that
you're
talking
about
a
different
kind
of
issue.
you're
talking
about
one
that
involves
everything.
a
reasoned
moral
response
to
a
person,
his
whole
life,
to
an
event,
to
all
aspects
of
it
in
a
way
that
cannot
necessarily
be
predicted.
that's
why
you
don't
cabin
these
into
a...
into
a
particular
set
of
facts.
but
when
you
talk
about
a
crime,
you're
talking
about
specific
individual
facts
that
can't
be
substituted
for
that
are
limited
by
law.
and
that's
exactly
what
arizona
has
done
in
its
different
characterization
of
what
is
an
aggravating
circumstance
than
florida
has.
now,
florida
case
law
has
evolved
partly,
as
justice
stevens'
recognized
in
barclay,
under
this...
under
what...
under
the
impression
of
what
this
court
required,
to
look
more
like
arizona.
but
the
statute,
i
think,
that
patterson
v.
new
york
says,
a
statute
is
what
describes
the
minimum.
and
the
statute
is
what
i
think
the
fourteenth
amendment
looks
like.
another
way
to
look
at
this,
i
think,
is
the
way
the
court
has
in
the
due
process
cases
where
the
state
has
created
a
liberty
interest.
you
have...
we
have
a
finite
number
of
factors
that
specifically
controls
discretion.
then
a
liberty
interest
attaches
and
the
question...
the
due
process
attaches,
and
the
question
is
what
process
is
due.
and
the
frames
of
the
sixth
and
fourteenth
amendments
this
court
has
said
when
it's
incorporated...
has
said
that
they
understood
the
process
due
for
a
fact
that
is
prerequisite
to
a
deprivation
of
life
or
liberty
to
be
trial
by
jury.
and
they
said
it
twice,
and
they
said
it
explicitly.
now,
that
jury
may
vary
in...
in
its
composition.
there
may
be
various
rules
about
whether
its
unanimous
vote
is
required
or
not.
those
kinds
of
things
have
changed,
and
they
changed
before
the
constitution
was
written.
they
were
in
flux
in
1791.
that's
why
this
court
has
allowed
variation
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
in
1868.
but
this
never
changed.
we
have
our...
our
citations
run
from
1458
up
through
the
turn
of
the
century
and
even
in
cases
that...
as
recently
as
last
summer.
and
those
citations
have
never
changed,
and
that
understanding
of
what
trial
by
jury
applies
to
has
never
changed.
and
unless
there
is
some
law,
unless
there
is
some
line
that
the
state
has
never
described
to
us
that
lies
between
these
facts
and...
again,
justice
stevens'
worst
case
hypothetical
in
the
mcmillan
case,
then
i
don't
know
what
is
going
to
be
left
potentially
of
the
sixth
amendment
in
the
third
century
of
the
constitution
because
juries
are
sometimes
a
little
intractable.
they're
inconvenient,
they
don't
necessarily
go
along
with
what
the
government
wants,
they
don't
necessarily
find
the
facts
the
way
the...
as
justice
white
pointed
out
in
duncan...
that
the
more
practiced
and
professional
eye
of
a
judge
would
like
it,
and
people
often
try
and
make
incursions
on
their
power.
and
that
was
a
major
source
of
the
battle
that
left...
the
legal
battle
that
led
to
the
declaration
of
independence
and
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
protecting
that
right
in
criminal
cases.
and
i
don't
know
where
the
line
is
if
it
doesn't
encompass
this
kind
of
a
statute,
which
in
every
characteristic
but
label
is
the
equivalent
of
the
elements
of
a
crime.
i
would
like
to
save
some
rebuttal
time,
so
unless
there's
other
questions--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--the
other
issues
are
difficult
for
me
to
argue,
justice
white,
because
the
court
has
other
cases
that
are
so
close
to
them.
our
statute
is
more
extreme
than
those...
those
cases,
those
statutes
from
pennsylvania
and
california.
they...
this
statute
includes
all
the
problems
of
mandatoriness
and
limiting
litigation,
and
in
addition,
it
has
this
presumption
of
death
that
we've
talked
about.
but,
in
my
limited
time
and
the
number
of
issues
i
have,
i
would
like
to
reserve
that
because
i
know
the
court
is
giving
that
a
hard
look
in
those
cases.
unless
the
court
has
questions--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
justice
kennedy,
you
won't
find
the
word...
the
phrase
"elements
of
the
offense"
anywhere
in
the
arizona
statute.
they
don't
say
anything
as
an
element
or
not
that
has
to
be
decided
by
what
the
thing
does.
with
regard
to
the
defendant's
having
actually
committed
the
actus
reus,
pulling
the
trigger,
the
aggravating
factors
that
were
found
here
under
the
statute
are...
and,
unfortunately,
one
of
the
things
that
happens
when
you
get
sloppy
with
judge
sentencing
is,
if
you'll
notice,
the
judge's
findings
are
not
even
in
the
words
of
the
statute.
but
the
statute
says
the
defendant
committed
the
murder
in
a
heinous,
cruel
or
depraved
fashion,
especially;
the
defendant
committed
the
murder
for
expectation
of
something
of
pecuniary
value.
that's
a
paraphrase.
and,
of
course,
the
essence
of
the
judge's
finding
that
this
was
heinous...
or
at
least
the
arizona
supreme
court's
finding...
gloss
on
in.
what
they
say
was
heinous
about
it
is
that
mr.
walton
pulled
the
trigger.
that's
what
made
him
eligible.
that
is
the
issue.
every
issue,
actus
reus,
mens
reus,
down
the
line,
is
converted.
and
the
answer
that
arizona
gives
is
the
one
that
they
have
here.
we
call
it
sentencing.
and
when
we
call
it
sentencing,
the
sixth
amendment
vanishes
and
the
right
to
jury
trial
vanishes.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
sufficient
answer.
i
don't
think
that
the
phrase
"element
of
the
offense"
or
"aggravating
circumstance"
is
a
talisman.
this
talisman
is
the
phrase
"trial
by
jury".
and
that
is
what
the
sixth
amendment
framers
i
believe
had
in
mind
on
this
kind
of
question.
the--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--it's--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--that's
right.
spaziano
i
think
says
that
those
sentencing
determinations
can
be
left
to
the
judge.
that
was
done
in...
in
the
18th
and
19th
century.
there's
no
question
about
it.
and
the
fact
that
modern
statutes
require
judges
to
give
reasons
why
they
did
it
so
there
can
be
appellate
review,
that
doesn't
change
it.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
well,
when
you
specify...
because
there...
the
line
between
where
we
are
and
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
and
mcmillan
vanishes
because
there
no
longer
is
any
answer
left
except
we
called
it
sentencing,
therefore,
it's
okay.
every
other
answer
is...
has
fallen.
and
this
court
has
let
the
states,
i
think
by
hildwin
and
spaziano,
go
as
far
as
it
possibly
can
preserving
that
core
of
sixth
amendment
trial
by
a
jury.
but
if
it
goes
this
additional
step,
the
core
is
gone.
and
there
is
nothing
that
anyone
has
suggested
at
any
level...
and
we've
argued
this
many
times...
that
will
be
left
to
say,
states,
these
things
are
what
the
framers
meant
in
1791
when
they
said
there
will
be
trial
by
jury
in
criminal
cases.
as
there
was...
as
it
was
fought
for
in
william
penn's
case
and
john
peter
zenger's
case
where
the
judges
tried
to
say,
oh,
well,
the
libelousness
is
a
question
of
law,
we'll
take
that
away,
the
colonists
said
no.
and
zenger's
case
was
very
much
in
the
minds
of
the
framers
of
the
constitution
and
blackstone
and
the
people
who
they
were
looking
to
understand
why...
it
tells
us
why
they
put
those
words
in
the
constitution
twice.
the...
the
cruelty
question,
the
third
question...
the
heinous,
cruel
and
depraved...
if
the
court
looks
at
the
previous
arizona
cases,
they
will
see
this
evolution.
those
facts...
no
previous
case
had
found,
as
this
one
does,
that
the
uncertainty
as
to
fate
is
enough
to
constitute
cruelty.
it
was
a
fact
that
in
some
of
these
previous
cases
people
had
been
uncertain.
but
what
happens
when
you
have
the
appellate
court
with
no
specific
touchstone,
it
evolves
and
the
things
that
were
incidental
in
one
case
become
important
in
the
next
case,
become
sufficient
in
the
third
case.
and
if
you'll
look
at
the
cases
the
state
has
relied
on,
you
will
find
that.
think
if...
where...
where
would
we
be
now
under
the...
under
the
arizona's
rational...
had...
there
had
never
been
an
intentional
homicide
here
had
there
been
a
police
chase
while
they
were
on
their
way
out
into
the
desert
and
there
had
been
a
crash.
mr.
powell
would
have
died
in
the
course
of
a
felony
even
though
unintentionally
and
he
would
have
feared
for
his
life.
it
would
have
been
cruel.
they
have
expanded
it
that
far.
if
you
had
the
classic
law
school
example
of
walking
into
the
convenience
store
and
pulling
the
store
and
pulling
the
gun
and
the
person
has
a
heart
attack.
that
fear
would
be
painful.
the
rhetoric
of
a
prosecutor
could
say,
imagine
the
pain,
imagine
the
fear,
imagine
the
agony.
the
defendant
should
have
known
he
would
have
done
this.
and
that
rhetoric
can
drive
the
rage
that
people
feel
when
these
homicides
occur
and
cause
death
to
be
imposed
in
a
fashion
that
is
not
regular
and
arbitrary.
and
we
have
cited
many,
many
cases
where
arizona
judges,
like
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
and
like
the
trial
judge
in
this
case,
at
least
by
his
ruling,
did
not
understand
that
this
was
the
rule.
if
you
look
at
the
prosecutor's
argument,
he
wasn't
talking
about
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
ultimately
held.
he
had
a
completely
different
idea
of
what
the
statute
meant.
our...
the
middle
issue
which
i
did
not
address
is
not
here
as
an
abstract
issue.
there
was
serious
mitigating
evidence
in
this
case
which
was
brought
forth
in
a
very
haphazard
fashion
because
we
live
in
an
imperfect
world
and
because
judge
sentencing
in
arizona
is
a
very
informal
process.
but
we
know
mr.
walton
had
a
terrible
childhood,
he
had
a
drug
abuse
history,
he
was
living
in
poverty
at
the
time
of
this
crime.
all
that
came
in
in
a
very
vague
undefined
fashion
and
there
is
no
indication
it
was
given
any
weight
by
the
trial
judge.
we
have
to
assume
that
was
because
of
the
statute.
thank
you.
