mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
raises
essentially
four
contentions
challenging
their...
the
constitutionality
of
the
arizona
death
penalty
statute.
i
too
would
like
to
begin
in
inverse
order
as
they
appear
in
the
brief
and
begin
with
the
constitutionality
of
the
arizona
supreme
court's
definition
of
the
aggravating
circumstance
of
especially
heinous,
cruel
or
depraved.
in
maynard
v.
cartwright,
this
court
reviewed
oklahoma's
aggravating
circumstance
of
especially
heinous,
atrocious
and
cruel
and
found
it
to
be
unconstitutionally
vague
because
the
oklahoma
courts
had
refused
to
define
the
term
to
inform
the
sentencing
jury
what
facts
it
was...
must
find
to
impose
death.
it
was
this
lack
of
definition
that
left
the
sentencing
body
with
the
discretion
to
impose
death
whenever
it
desired,
in
violation
of
furman.
arizona
has
not
left
its
corresponding
terms
of
especially
heinous,
cruel
or
depraved
aggravating
circumstance
so
ill-defined.
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
taken
the
terms
and
divided
into
two
separate
categories.
the
existence
of
facts
which
would
support
the
definition
in
either
category
will
find...
will
make
it
so
that
the
aggravating
circumstance
is
found.
the
first
prong
of
the
test
is
cruelty,
and
it's
proved
when
the
state
presents
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
victim
consciously
suffered
mental
anguish
or
physical
pain
prior
to
death.
the
second
category
is
heinousness
or--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--justice
scalia,
the--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--he
did
know
because--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--that's
correct.
and
the
arizona
supreme
court
said
those
facts
did
not
support
the
finding
because
the
defendant
did
not
know
or
could
not
reasonably
foresee
it.
it's
the
foreseeability
test
that
was...
what
was
addressed
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
state
v.
adamson.
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
intend
that
his
victim
suffer
so
long
as
he
knows
or
should
know
that
his
acts
are
causing
the
mental
anguish
or
the
physical
pain.
the
second
category
is
heinous
or
depraved.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
your
honor,
in
order
to
understand
that
you
have
to
understand--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--the...
the
facts
do
not
have
to
be
specified
in
the
written
order.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
your
honor,
how
it
comes
to
appellate
review
is
what
i
was
trying
to
get
into.
in...
under
the
state
due
process,
the
state
must
notice
those
aggravating
factors
it
intends
to
pursue
and
specifically
list
the
facts
which
would
support
the
aggravating
circumstance.
and
that
was
done
in
this
case.
the
state
gave
notice
that
it
was
going
to
seek
the
aggravating
circumstance
of
especially
heinous,
depraved...
cruel,
heinous
or
depraved,
under
both
prongs
of
the
test.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
the
trial
court
stated
that
it
found
the
circumstance...
it
stated
it
found
cruel,
heinous
or
depraved.
it
said...
did
not
say
that
it
rejected
either
of
the
fact
patterns
proffered
by
the
state.
on
independent
review
the
arizona
supreme
court
looked
at
the
facts
offered
by
the
state
and
found
by
the
trial
court
to
exist
based
on
its
finding
and
said
that
only
on
one
set
of
facts
did
it
support
the
cruelty
finding,
that
of
the
mental
suffering
prior
to
the
shooting,
which
was
alleged
by
the
state
in
the
sentencing
memorandum.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
many,
many
times.
it
has
been
articulated
in
state
v.
lujan.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
that
was
the
second
area
i
was
getting...
that
the
problem
with
maynard
is
that
the
sentencing
body,
the
juries,
were
not
given
instructions
on
what
the
definition
of
the
law
was
to
inform
them
what
facts
were
necessary
to
be
found.
trial
courts
do
not
have
that
same
problem.
if
there
arises
a
dispute
in
the
facts,
the
trial
court
can
certainly
go
to
the
law
library
and
read
past
cases
to
see
what
fact
patterns
have
fallen
within
or
without
this
test.
a
similar
issue
raised
in
the
brief
is
that
the
definition
given
these
two
prongs
of
the
arizona
test
are
unconstitutionally
broad.
in
order
to
address
overbreadth,
this
court
must
begin
its
analysis
with
lowenfeld
v.
phelps.
now,
in
lowenfeld
v.
phelps--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--your
honor,
the
contention
is
that
it
applies
to
too
many
or
it
applies
to
all
first-degree
murderers.
therefore,
it
doesn't
genuinely
narrow
the
classification.
but
we...
when
we
address
overbreadth
you
look
at
lowenfeld
where
the
aggravating
factor
simply
mirrored
an
element
to
the
first-degree
murder.
and
in
this
court,
it
said
it
would
look
to
the
entire--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--no,
your
honor,
i
can't--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--the
contention
was
raised
in
lowenfeld
that
the
circumstance--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
overbreadth
does
not
apply.
but
the
aggravating
circumstance,
as
defined,
does
genuinely
narrow
the
classification,
as
taken
in
context
with
the
entire
arizona
scheme.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
no,
your
honor.
the
contention
in
lowenfeld
was
that
the
aggravating
circumstance
found
simply
mirrored
an
element
of
the
crime.
therefore,
it
applies--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--that's
right.
that
the--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--like--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--no.
arizona
does
not.
we
believe
that,
like
louisiana,
we
have
four
classes
of
homicide
and
that
when
you
get
to
the
final
classification
then
we
have
additional
factors
which
narrow...
narrow
the
existence
or
those
that
are
death
eligible.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
one
of
those
is
the
factor
we're
just
talking
about.
just
like
louisiana--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--no,
because
it
didn't...
wasn't
required
in
lowenfeld.
the
factor
found
in
lowenfeld
was
simply
mirrored
in--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--many
of
the
cases
that
would
fall
within
louisiana
would
not
be
first-degree
murder
in
arizona
and
vice
versa.
but
we're
saying
overall
the
effect
is
a
genuine
narrowing
process.
it
does
genuinely
narrow
those
people
that
would
be
eligible
for
death.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
absolutely
not.
i'm
saying
arizona
has
two
levels
of
narrow--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--no,
your
honor.
let
me
start
one
more
time.
in
lowenfeld
this
court
said
that
the
narrowing
function
took
place
when
the
juries
found
the
first-degree
murders...
the
defendant
guilty
of
first-degree
murder.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
that
is
correct.
but
the
person
was
not
death
eligible
unless
he
had
an
aggravating
circumstance.
the
aggravating
circumstance
simply
mirrored
an
element
of
the
offense.
our
cruel,
heinous
and
depraved
circumstance,
while
it
may
apply
to
many
that
are
convicted
of
first-degree
murder,
it
certainly
does
not
apply
to
all
of
them.
therefore,
it
does
serve
a
narrowing
function.
but
even
like
the
louisiana
statutes,
our...
our
classifications
of
homicide
does
narrow
those
that
would
be
eligible
for
death.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
that
is
also
correct.
it
does
it.
we
don't
have
to
have
it,
but
we
do
and
it
does
perform
that
function.
and
when
you
look
at
the
entire
sentencing
scheme,
along
with
the
homicide
classifications,
it
is
an
additional
safeguard
to
generally
narrow
the
classifications.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
it
is
no
different
than
any
other
aggravating
circumstance.
i
would
like
to
now
address
petitioner's
contentions
regarding
whether
or
not
the
constitution
prohibits
the
state
from
imposing
an
evidentiary
burden
of
proof
on
a
criminal
defendant
to
show
mitigation.
in
order
to
understand
this
argument,
the
court
needs
to
understand
exactly
what
analytical
process
the
state
goes
through
to
prove
or
to
show
the
death
penalty
in
arizona.
the
state
proves
the
aggravation.
at
that
point
in
time
the
defendant
may
present
anything
he
or
she
desires
in
mitigation.
the
trial
court
is
simply
to
consider
those
facts
that
it
believes
to
be
proved
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
assign
those
facts
it
believes
to
be
true
mitigating
weight.
the
trial
court
then
weighs
and
balances
the
aggravation
and
the
mitigation
and
determines
whether
the
mitigation
is
sufficient
to
warrant
leniency.
the
only
burden
placed
on
the
defendant
is
that
if
he
wants
the
trial
court
to
consider
facts
and
mitigation
he
must
produce
sufficient
evidence
for
the
court
to
believe
that
they
are
probably
true.
the
arizona
supreme
court
independently
reviews
the
record
to
determine
if
all
of
the
mitigating
evidence
was
considered
and
then
independently
determines
if
they
are...
if
the
arizona
supreme
court
is
convinced
that
the
death
penalty
is
the
appropriate
sentence.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
if
he
believes
the
defendant
has
failed
to
meet
its
evidentiary
burden,
then
he
is
precluded
from
considering
that.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
well,
mills
is
a
different
situation,
your
honor,
because
there
the
sentencer
was
the
jury
and
one
juror
was
controlling
whether
or
not
the
mitigation
was
found.
in
this
case--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--that's
correct.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
that
is
correct.
the
problem
was
the...
the
requirement
placed
in
maryland
that
it
be
unanimous.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
because
under
the
preponderance
standard
it
means
that
it
is
probably
not
true.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
the
defendant
makes
a
facial
attack
on
the
statute.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
because
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
that
our
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face
in
that...
in
that
case.
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
refused
to
go
along
with
that
decision.
therefore,
we
are
in
a
conflict.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
is--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--no,
i
do
not
believe
that's
the
case.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
i'm
defending
this
because
the
petitioner
makes
it
and
based
on
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
there's
a
deadlock
that
cannot
be
resolved
unless
this
court
resolves
the
issue.
in
getting
back
to
a
related
argument
of
justice
white's
question,
this
court
in
franklin
v.
lynaugh
said
that
residual
doubt
to
the
ultimate
penalty...
or,
i
mean,
the
ultimate
guilt/innocent
was
not
constitutionally
required
for
the
trial...
for
the
sentencing
jury
to
consider.
if
the
trial
court
determines
that
it
does
not
exist,
the
residual
doubt
on
whether
or
not
it
was
true
should
not
be
constitutionally
mandated
for
the
sentencer
to
consider.
this
does
not
offend
the
common
notions
of
decency
as
stated
in
patterson
v.
new
york
where
traditionally
affirmative
defenses
in
mitigation
was
placed
upon
the
defendant
to
prove
the
existence
of
such
evidence.
rational
moral
response
requires
that
the
sentencing
court,
in
equating
whether
or
not
the
death
penalty
to
be
imposed,
rely
on
evidence
that
it
has
determined
probably
exists
and
not
mere
speculation.
it
ensures
consistency
and
it
ensures
reliability.
the
final
issue
that
i
wold
like
to
address
this
afternoon
is
whether
or
not
arizona
has
a
mandatory
or
presumptive
death
penalty.
i'm
not
going
to
take
up
this
court's
time
in
going
through
all
of
the
arguments
proffered
by
the
sister
states
of
california
and
pennsylvania.
the
state
of
arizona
agrees
with
the
position
taken
by
those
states
in
those
cases
that
are
presently
pending
before
this
court.
there
is
a
difference,
however,...
a
slight
difference...
between
those
cases
and
this
case
in
that
in
pennsylvania
and
in
california
the
question
is
what
a
reasonable
juror
would...
or,
jury
would
determine
how
it
is
to
apply
the
instructions
given.
in
this
case,
the
trial
court
may
look
at
the
law
and
review
all
of
the
cases
to
determine
if
there
is
an
appropriate
sentence
based
on
the
mitigation
and
the
aggravation
posed.
regarding
the
first
issue,
that
of
judicial
sentencing,
it's
the
state's
belief
that
this
issue
has
been
resolved
in
its
favor
in
hildwin
and
spaziano.
therefore,
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
specific
questions
about
that
issue,
i've
concluded
my
remarks.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
absolutely
not.
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
stated
that
in
state
v.
blazack,
that
it--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--it
is
within
the
purview
of
the
state
court
to
determine
the
purpose
for
which
it...
those
aggravating
factors
exist.
and
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
stated
that
the
purpose
of
those
factors
is
simply
to
channel
or
narrow
the
sentencing
discretion,
which
is
what
was
affirmed
in
hildwin
and
which
was
affirmed
in
spaziano.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
absolutely.
and
that
is
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
has
stated
in
rejecting
that
notion
that
is
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
that
would
not
be
an
aggravating
offense,
the
simple
fact
whether
or
not
he
pulled
the
trigger.
that
is
not
an
enumerated
aggravating
circumstance.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
he
was--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--he
was...
he
was
convicted
under
first-degree
murder.
the
jurors
believed
either
that
he
himself
did
it
or
through
accomplice
liability
he
had...
he
had
committed
that
crime.
the
only
issue
that
was
not
made
by
a
jury
was
the...
the...
the
enmund-tison
finding
which
was
in
fact
made
by
the
trial
judge,
which
this
court
has
said
was
okay
in
cabana.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
the
judge
said
it
was
relevant
in
determining
mitigation
because
one
of
the
proffered
mitigating
circumstances
was
that
he...
his
claim
that
i
did
not
do
it.
and
the
judge
said,
i
believe...
i
believe
you
did
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so,
it
was
relevant
in
that
he
rejected
one
of
the
proffered
mitigating
circumstances
asked
by
defendant.
but
it
did
not
go
to
the
aggravation
in
any
form.
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
the
elements
of
whether
or
not
the
defendant
is
liable
for
first-degree
murder
have
not
changed.
there...
they're
still
there.
whether
or
not
he
is
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
is
an
enmund-tison
question,
which
this
court
has
said
in
cabana
the
trial
court
could
make.
the
arizona
legislature--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--the
difference
between--
mr.
paul
joseph
mcmurdie
--your
honor,
you
can
simply...
in
my
state
you
can
simply
look
at
the
purpose
based
on
the
legislative
history
of
the
aggravating
circumstances.
in
1972
when
furman
came
down,
the
arizona
legislature
convened
a
session
to
create
in
effect
a
new
sentencing
procedure.
they
did
not
change
the
substantive
law.
in
1974
this
statute
was
enacted,
adding
aggravating
factors.
in
1978
they
revised
the
code
and
then
simply
then
redefined
the
crime.
but
it
did
not
change
the
underlying
basis
that
these
factors
are
what
the
arizona
legislature
has
determined
is
the
objective
standard
by
which
the
sentencers
are
to
channel
or
to
narrow
those
that
would
be
death
eligible.
but
it
has
never
changed
or
altered
the
elements
of
offense
as
defined
by
the
arizona
legislature
for
first-degree
murder.
this
is
not
an
attempt
to
circumvent
the
sixth
amendment
right.
