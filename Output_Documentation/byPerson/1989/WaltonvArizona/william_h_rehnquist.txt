chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
89-7351,
jeffrey
alan
walton
v.
arizona.
mr.
ford.
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
this
to
you
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
or
the
eighth
amendment
or
both
or--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
how
do
you
get
around
our
hildwin
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
but
there
was
the
trial
judge
who
carried
out...
who
had
the
final
say.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah,
but
the
judge
in
florida
does.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
have
you...
you
must
take
it
as
we
understood
it
in
hildwin.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
take...
take
this
sentence
from,
mr.
ford,
from
hildwin:
the
ultimate
decision
to
impose
a
sentence
of
death,
however,
is
made
by
the
court
after
finding
at
least
one
aggravating
circumstance.
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
it
was
made
by
the
court
after
the
court
found
an
aggravating
circumstance.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
see...
you
know,
you've
made
this
very
broad
statement
here
that
all
facts
must
be
found
by
a
jury
under
the
sixth
amendment.
and
then
you've
been
presented
with
five
or
six...
you
know,
what
i
suppose
you
call
exception...
and
you've
said,
well,
these
are
all
exceptions.
but
that
casts
some
doubt
on
the
statement
as
your...
your
generality.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what...
what...
what
would
have
been
understood
about
aggravating
circumstances
in
1791?
nobody
ever
heard
of
them.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you're
just
arguing
that
hildwin
is
wrong.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--how
does...
does
it
differ?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--why
should
that
make
any
difference,
the
fact
that
one
aggravating
circumstance
isn't
enough
to
impose
the
death
penalty
in
florida?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
is
that
distinguished
for
sixth
amendment
purposes?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
a
judge
can
make
findings
that
the
considerations
existed,
but
a
jury
has
to
make
findings
that
aggravating
circumstances
existed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
no.
those...
those
findings
in
florida
made
the
person
eligible
for
a
sentence
by
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
arizona
still
has
a
series
of
elements
in
the
offense
that
the
jury
has
to
find
to
make
you
come
within
a
definite
first
step
of
a
capital
sentencing
process.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ford.
mr.
mcmurdie.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i...
i
thought
i
also
understood
your
response
to
justice
stevens
that
it
does
perform
some
narrowing
function.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
were
the...
were
there
specific
examples
here
of
efforts
by
the
defendant
to
show
mitigating
circumstances
which
one
of
the
arizona
courts
said
needn't
be
considered
or
shouldn't
be
considered
because
of
failure
of
proof?
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
why...
why
is
that
question
involved
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
think
we
have
to
perhaps
get
back
to
what
justice
o'connor
mentioned
before.
how...
how
do
we
get
facial
attacks
on
statutes
where
we're
not
talking
about
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
our
capital
punishment
jurisprudence
says
that
you
simply
go
through
all
the
provisions
of
a
statute
in
the
abstract
regardless
of
how
they
may
have
been
applied
to
the
particular
defendant
in
question
and
says,
well,
this
is
good,
but
this
isn't?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
don't
think
there
should
be
permitted
a
facial
attack?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you're...
you're
defending
this
because
the
petitioner
makes
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcmurdie.
mr.
ford,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ford.
the
case
is
submitted.
