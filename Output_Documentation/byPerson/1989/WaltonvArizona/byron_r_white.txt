justice
white
well,
what
about
this...
how
about
the
fact
that
justice
scalia
points
to?
you
say
it's
a
hypothetical
but,
nevertheless,
that's
what
the...
that's
what
the
arizona
supreme
court
recited.
and
what
about
that
fact?
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--well,
what
if
they
did
say
it
in
this
case?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
they...
they
carried
out
an
independent
review
of
the
death
sentence
and
they
said
here
is
what
cruelty
is.
it's
either
this
or
that.
and
whatever
it
is,
it's
present
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
that's
what
they
said.
justice
white
well,
arizona...
the
arizona
court
purported
to
exercise
its
authority...
an
authority
under
state
law
to
affirm
the...
the
death
sentence
despite
any...
any
evidence
that
the
sentencer
below
had
that
in
mind.
justice
white
they
said,
here
is
a...
here
is...
here
is
what
cruelty
is,
and
on
the
facts
of
this
case
there
was
cruelty.
justice
white
but
you
say
that
is
contrary
to
maynard?
justice
white
well,
what
do
you
do
about
cabana?
justice
white
i
know,
but
in...
he...
that...
that...
that
defendant
was
not
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
unless
it
was
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
he
killed
or
intended
to
kill.
justice
white
and
we...
i
thought
we
indicated
that
that
wasn't
necessarily
a
job
for
a
jury.
justice
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but...
so
that
your
generality,
the
way
you
put
it,
isn't
quite
true,
that...
that
if
a...
if
a
fact
is
necessary
to
make
somebody
eligible
for
the
death
penalty,
it
must
be
found
by
the
jury.
justice
white
that's
what
you
said.
justice
white
well,
i
take
it
the
definition
of
cruelty
that
the
supreme
court
articulated
in
this...
in
its
opinion
in
this
case
was...
had
been
previously
articulated--
justice
white
--in
the
two
or
three
cases
they
cited.
justice
white
so,
i
suppose
you
can
assume
trial
courts
know
what
the
law
is,
what
the
definition
of
that--
justice
white
--[inaudible]
in
non-first
amendment
case?
justice
white
well,
that's
no
different
from
the
aggravating
circumstances
in
any
other
death
penalty
statute.
justice
white
what
if
the
trial
judge
thinks
the
evidence
is
in
equipoise
as
to
the
existence
of
a...
of
mitigating
evidence?
i
take
it
under
arizona...
the
arizona
statute
he
would
be...
not
be
entitled
to
consider
that
mitigating
evidence
at
all.
justice
white
what
do
you
do
about
mills?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
the...
but
the...
so,
the...
so
the
problem
was
unanimity,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
and
the
net
result
of
it
even
if...
even
if
it
wasn't
unanimous...
even
if
it
was
11
to
1
that
there
was
a
mitigating
circumstance,
the...
or
there
was
no
mitigating
circumstance...
one
juror
was
still
entitled
under
mills
to
consider
the
mitigating
evidence.
justice
white
but
the
trial
judge
here
is...
unless...
unless...
unless
the
evidence
is...
the
mitigating
circumstance
is
proved
by
a
preponderance
to
his
satisfaction--
justice
white
--he
will
not
consider
it
at
all.
