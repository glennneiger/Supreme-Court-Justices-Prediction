justice
o'connor
now,
arizona
does
not
require
the
trial
judge
to
spell
out
what
factors
of
the
crime
make...
make
it
especially
heinous
and
cruel?
justice
o'connor
yes
or
no?
justice
o'connor
it
would
certainly
make
it
easier
on
appellate
review,
wouldn't
it?
justice
o'connor
but
you
nonetheless
do
not
know
which
factors
were
relied
on
and
found
to
exist
by
the
trial
judge?
justice
o'connor
have
we
ever
had
a
case
that
applies,
quote,
overbreadth,
unquote,
in
a
capital
case?
justice
o'connor
why
are
you
talking
about
it
as
though
we
had?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
would
think
you
would
say
overbreadth
doesn't
apply.
