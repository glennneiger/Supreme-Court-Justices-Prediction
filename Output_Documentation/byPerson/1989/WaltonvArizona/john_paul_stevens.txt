i
must
say
i
didn't
really
follow
your
argument
based
on
lowenfeld.
that
wasn't...
it
wasn't
this
kind
of
aggravating
circumstance,
was
it?
justice
stevens
and
if
the
crime
is...
and
that
the
category
of
people
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
was
adequately
narrowed
by
the
definition
of
the
crime.
isn't
that
what
we
had
on
that?
justice
stevens
so
what
does
that
got
to
do
with
this
case?
justice
stevens
because
you
don't
rely
on
that.
you
contend
you
need
the
aggravating
circumstance
to
narrow
the
class,
don't
you?
justice
stevens
but
isn't
one
of
those
the
factor
you're
just
talking
about?
maybe
i
just
don't
follow
you.
justice
stevens
oh.
justice
stevens
so
then
it
is
necessary
that
that
factor
perform
a
legitimate
narrowing
function,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
but
your...
does
your
statute...
is
your
statute
just
as
narrow
as
the
louisiana
statute
was?
justice
stevens
i'm
still
puzzled.
are
you
saying
then
that
the
finding
with
respect
to
heinous
and
cruelty
is
superfluous?
justice
stevens
well,
then
if
it's
not
superfluous,
why...
why
doesn't
it
have
to
perform
a
narrowing
function?
i
don't
understand
your
argument;
i'm
just...
i
guess
i'm
thick.
justice
stevens
as
narrowly
defined
in
that
statute.
