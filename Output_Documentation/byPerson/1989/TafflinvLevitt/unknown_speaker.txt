mr.
goldberger,
do
you
think
there
is
any
difference
between
the
standards
laid
down
in
gulf
offshore
and
the
traditional
standards
of
the
claflin
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
where
do
you
find
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
even
considered
the
question?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
that
falls
far
short
of
any
kind
of
indication
by
congress
that
they
didn't
expect
the
normal
presumption
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
apply.
unknown
speaker
it
looks
to
me
like
you're
just
left
with
your
argument
on
incompatibility
and
i'm
not
sure
it
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
all
that
clear
that
this
court
was
on
the
right
track
under
the
clayton
act.
why
would
we
want
to
extend
it
to
a
new
statute?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
state
courts
are
called
upon
to
interpret
federal
law
in
every
situation
in
which
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction.
i
don't
see
why
this
is
any
different.
unknown
speaker
and
state
courts
can
follow
that
federal
interpretation
as
they
employ
suits
under
rico
it
seems
to
me.
i
don't
see
that
it
arises...
or,
that
it
rises
to
the
level
of
any
serious
incompatibility.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
state
courts
would
just
go
off
on
their
own
in
interpreting
federal
criminal
laws?
just
like
federal
courts
construing
questions
of
state
law
tend
to
follow
state
law,
i
would
think
the
state
courts
would
tend
to
follow
federal
court
decisions
in
the
area
of
federal
criminal
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
couldn't
get
something
much
more
fouled
up
than
we
had
under
the
mcnally
case
with
a
uniform
federal--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
there
is
any
statute
that
can't
suffer
from
leaving
it
to
state
courts
it's
rico.
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
goldberger,
what's
the
name
of
the
case
in
which
this
court
decided
that
state
courts
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
clayton
act
claims?
unknown
speaker
freeman
v.
bee
decided
that?
unknown
speaker
don't...
please
go
on
with
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
goldberger.
mr.
marks.
unknown
speaker
mr.
marks,
do
you
think
the
court's
decision
to
say
that
clayton
act
jurisdiction
was
exclusively
in
federal
courts
meets
that
test?
unknown
speaker
but,
of
course,
the
court
really
didn't
say
anything
in
the...
in
the
bee
case.
it
just
has
one
sentence
and
a
footnote.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
marks.
mr.
goldberger,
you
have
15
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
are
the
two
cases
you
cite
for
exclusivity...
is
that
the
best
you've
got?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but--
unknown
speaker
--in
holding
that
the
clayton
act
enforcement
is
exclusively
in
the
federal
courts,
are
those
two
cases
the
best
you've
got?
unknown
speaker
and
you
cited
that?
did
you
cite
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
didn't
cite
it...
you
didn't
cite
it
along
when
you
cited
these
other
two?
unknown
speaker
is
it
in
your
brief...
in
your
index?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
name
of
the
case?
unknown
speaker
oh,
yeah.
yeah.
unknown
speaker
and
where
is
it
cited?
unknown
speaker
you
also
say
you
rely
on
a
case
called
continental
something
for
the
proposition
that
antitrust
actions
cannot
be
brought
in
state
court?
am
i
misquoting
you?
unknown
speaker
general
investment.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
find
general
investment
in
your
brief.
do
you
have
a
citation?
i
mean,
i
don't
find
it
in
your
index.
there
it
is
right
there.
no,
that's
the
other
side.
do
you
have--
--it's
260,
261?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
going
back
to
marrese
for
a
second,
isn't
that
the
case
in
which
judge
posner
on
the
seventh
circuit
after
the
remand
suggested
that
maybe
the
old
rule
wasn't
so
correct
after
all?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
were
not
correct.
