mr.
andrew
h.
marks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
striking
in
listening
to
petitioners'
argument
that
they
drop
from
this
court's
unmistakable
implication
test
the
word
"unmistakable",
and
that
they
drop
from
this
court's
clear
and
disabling
incompatibility
test
the
words
"clear
and
disabling".
the
governing
rule
here
is
both
clear
and
well-established.
the
state
courts
have
an
inherent
right
to
adjudicate
all
claims
that
their
constitutions
and
their
state
legislatures
empower
them
to
hear.
it
matters
not
whether
those
claims
arise
under
state
law
or
under
federal
law,
or
under
the
laws
of
india
or
france
or
any
other
foreign
sovereign
for
that
matter.
the
state
courts
can
be
stripped
of
their
inherent
power
to
adjudicate
federal
claims
only
in
two
limited
circumstances:
where
congress
has
clearly
indicated
its
intent
to
do
so
either
by
explicit
statutory
language
or
unmistakable...
an
unmistakable
indication
in
its
legislative
deliberations
or
where
the
very
exercise
of
state
adjudicatory
power
would
be
fundamentally
incompatible
with
and
inimical
to
congress'
purposes
in
enacting
the
particular
statute
or
with
the
federal
government
status
as
a
superior
sovereign.
this
rule
is
deeply...
this
rule
is
deeply
rooted
in
our
federal
system.
for
the
first
100
years
of
our
republic,
the
federal
courts
had
no
general
federal
question
jurisdiction.
the
state
courts
alone
had
jurisdiction
over
most
federal
claims.
this
allocation
of
juridical
authority
reflected
the
conviction
of
the
constitution's
framers
and
of
the
first
congress,
that
the
state
courts
were
both
competent
and
appropriate
arbiters
of
federal
claims.
mr.
andrew
h.
marks
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are
distinctions
that
the
court
may
well
have
relied
on
in...
in
determining
that
there
is
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
clayton
act.
first
and
foremost,
quite
in
contrast
to
rico,
there
is
an
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
thought
about
the
issue
and
at
least
some
indication
that
it
was
congress'
intent
to
delegate
exclusively
to
federal
courts
the
responsibility
for
interpreting
the
antitrust
laws.
secondly,
i
think
the
court's
decision
in
the
clayton
act
cases
is
probably
best
explained
by
the
remarkably
open-ended
texture
of
the
clayton
act
and
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
historical
context
in
what
that
issue
came
before
the
court.
after
all,
that...
that
open
texture
of
a
law
for
the
first
time
criminalizing
legitimate
business
conduct
called
out
to
the
courts
to
really
develop
a
federal
common
law
regulating
business
conduct
that...
that
the
court
may
well
have
recognized
to
have
a
pervasive
effect
on
interstate
commerce.
so,
i
think
both
because
of...
of
the
legislative
history
and
because
of
the
historical...
context
of
the
clayton
acts,
i
think
that
the
court
may
have
approached
it
differently
than...
than
we're
dealing
here
with
today
under
rico.
mr.
andrew
h.
marks
that's
true,
your
honor.
and,
in
addition,
the
general
investment
case
certainly
doesn't...
doesn't
go
into
the
analysis
that
this
court
has
prescribed
in
claflin
and
has
consistently
followed
to
this
date.
the
rule
of
inherent
state
court
jurisdiction
over
federal
claims
remained
undisturbed
when
in
1875
congress
for
the
first
time
gave
the
federal
courts
general
federal
question
jurisdiction.
the
rule
remains
undiminished
today.
it
is
particularly
appropriate,
we
submit,
to
apply
this
historic
rule
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
rico.
civil
claims
under
rico
implicate
no
overriding
issues
of
federal
policy.
thus,
we
have
here
no
specialized
administrative
tribunal
created
to
interpret
or
enforce
rico.
the
vast
majority
of
rico
cases
involve
claims
of
garden-variety
fraud,
the
type
of
claim
with
which
the
federal
courts...
or,
the
state
courts...
pardon
me...
are
intimately
familiar.
in
addition,
state
law
violations
as
well
as
federal
law
violations
comprise
rico's
predicate
acts.
moreover,
the
states
plainly
share
the
federal
government's
interest
in
eradicating
organized
crime
and
in
compensating
its
victims.
more
than
half
the
states
have
enacted
their
own
versions
of
little
rico,
modeled
after
the
federal
act.
it
is
particularly
noteworthy
in
this
regard
that
each
of
the
state
high
courts
that
has
considered
the
issue
has
ruled
that
its
courts
are
competent
and
appropriate
tribunals
to
adjudicate
federal
rico
claims.
finally,
and
most
significantly,
rico's
remedial
purposes
will
be
promoted
by
giving
victims
of
organized
crime
a
choice
of
forums
in
which
to
assert
their
claims
for
damages.
it
has
been
conceded
that
rico's
legislative
history
is
mute
as
to
whether
congress
gave...
even
gave
thought
to
the
issue
of
exclusive
versus
concurrent
jurisdiction.
every
court
that
has
examined
the
act's
legislative
history
has
come
to
this
conclusion.
as
justice
o'connor
recognized,
it's
abundantly
clear
that
congress
never
even
considered
the
issue.
this
is
not
surprising.
this
is...
quote...
recognized
in
the
shearson/american
express
v.
mcmahon
case.
the
addition
of
rico's
civil
damages
remedy
was
an
11th
hour
amendment
to
that
legislation
and
received
only
brief
discussion.
the
only
fragment
of
legislative
history
that
the
proponents
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
seize
on
is
that
congress
borrowed
the
treble
damage
remedy
that
had
been
used
successfully
in
the
claytons
act
and
put
that
remedy
into
the
text
of
rico.
whereas
here...
whereas
here
it
is
clear
that
congress
never
even
considered
the
issue
of
whether
to
divest
the
state
courts
of
their
inherent
jurisdiction,
such
modeling,
we
submit,
cannot
meet
this
court's
unmistakable
implication
test.
moreover,
in
the
case
of
rico
this
modeling
is
a
particularly
weak
analogy
because,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
the
legislative
history
of
rico
shows
that
congress
did
not
intend
by
adopting
the
treble
damage
remedy
to
bring
with
it
all
of
the...
of
the
baggage
that...
had
been
developed
with
the
antitrust
laws
over
the
years,
particularly,
as
legislative
indicates,
that
congress
did
not
want
to
incorporate
the
many
obstacles
to
enforcement
of
the
antitrust
private
damage
remedy
that
had
been
developed.
this
court
has
never
found
an
implication
in
legislative
history
sufficient
to
rebut
the
strong
presumption
of
concurrent
jurisdiction.
the
rigor
with
which
this
court
has
applied
its
unmistakable
implication
test
is
demonstrated,
we
believe,
by
both
gulf
offshore
and
the
court's
section
1983
decisions.
the
legislative
history
of
the
outer
continental
shelf
lands
act,
which
the
court
considered
in
gulf
offshore,
contained
a
clear
statement
of
concern
by
the
opponents
of
that
bill
that
the
law
would
have
the
effect
of
providing
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
over
claims
under
that
act.
the
court
dismissed
that
evidence
of
legislative
intent
as
insufficient
to
constitute
an
unmistakable
implication
of
an
intent
to
strip
the
state
courts
of
their
jurisdiction.
even
more
instructive
is
the
court's
determination
that
section
1983
claims
are
subject
to
concurrent
jurisdiction.
the
legislative
history
of
section
1983
makes
unmistakably
clear
that
congress'
predominant
concern
was
creating
a
federal
forum
for
the
vindication
of
federal
rights
against
state
officials.
yet,
despite
that
predominant
focus
by
congress,
this
court
has
concluded
that
section
1983
claims
are
subject
to
concurrent,
not
exclusive,
jurisdiction.
turning
to
the
disabling
incompatibility
test,
here
we
have
no
inconsistency,
much
less
any
incompatibility,
between
rico's...
rico's
purposes
and
the
state
court
adjudication
of
civil
damage
claims.
the
overriding
purpose
of
rico's
civil
damage
provisions
was
to
provide
a
remedy
for
innocent
parties
who
are
victimized
by
organized
crime.
congress
expressly
admonished
the
courts
to
construe
rico
liberally
to
effectuate
those
remedial
purposes.
this
court
has
consistently
found
that
permitting
the
state
courts
to
entertain
federal
causes
of
action
facilitates
the
enforcement
of
federal
rights.
here,
recognizing
state
court
jurisdiction
over
rico
claims
will
allow
persons
victimized
by
organized
crime
to
pursue
their
claims
in
the
first
instance
in
forums
which
they
may
find
more
convenient
or
less
expensive.
certainly
there
is
nothing
inconsistent
with
rico's
remedial
aims
in
providing
plaintiffs
this
choice.
indeed,
it
is
the
closing
not
the
opening
of
state
courts
that
would
undermine
rico's
purposes.
let
me...
let
me
address
briefly
the
three
policy
considerations
on
which
petitioners
rest
their
incompatibility
argument.
none,
we
submit,
comes
close
to
showing
any
disabling
incompatibility.
as
i
understand
the
argument
today,
they
essentially
collapsed
two
of
those
considerations
into
one.
that
is,
the
concern
with
uniformity
of
interpretation
and
what
they
have
deemed
inappropriateness
of
a
state
court
interpretation
of
a
statute
that
relies
on
federal
criminal
laws
in
part.
with
respect
to
the
uniformity
argument,
this
identical
argument
was
advanced
and
rejected
by
the
court
in
dowd
box.
just
as
in
dowd,
there
is
simply
no
evidence
here
that
congress
believed
uniform
interpretation
to
be
any
more
important
with
respect
to
rico
than
with
respect
to
the
myriad
of
other
federal
statutes
that
the
state
courts
apply
every
day
of
the
week.
with
respect
to
the
inappropriateness
of...
that...
the
petitioners
allege
of
the
state
court's
interpreting
federal
criminal
laws,
the
concern,
as
i
understand
it
today,
is
that
somehow
the
state
courts
may
create
bad
precedent
by
misinterpreting
the
federal
criminal
laws.
in
the
first
instance,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
the
state
courts
are
obliged
to
follow
the
precedence
of
this
court
in
interpreting
the
federal
criminal
laws.
there
is
nothing,
moreover,
in
our
constitutional
scheme
that
prohibits
the
state
courts
from
adjudicating
federal
criminal
cases.
indeed,
as
the
court
recognized
in
testa
v.
kat,
there
have
been
times
in
the
history
of
our
republic
where
congress
has
delegated
to
the
federal
courts
the
enforcement
of
federal
criminal
laws.
there
is
also
nothing
unique
about
recognizing
concurrent
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts
to
hear
civil
cases
where
there
is
a
criminal
analog.
that
is
exactly
the
situation
in
section
1983.
that
statute,
of
course,
has
a
criminal
analog
in
18
u.s.c.
section
242.
finally,
the
same
incompatibility
argument
in
different
guise
was
made
to
the
court
in
mcmahon
and
this
court
rejected
it.
the
court
said...
the
argument
was
made
that
private
arbitral
panels
were
an
inappropriate
forum
for
there
to
be
interpretation
of
straight...
of
federal
criminal
laws.
the
court
rejected
that.
the
court...
certainly,
state
courts
have
more
experience
in
interpreting
the
criminal
laws
than
private
arbitral
panels.
finally,
there
has
been...
the
petitioners
have
made
some
argument
concerning
the
fact
that
there
are
certain
procedural
advantages
to
proceeding
in
federal
court
and
that
congress'
inclusion
of
those
procedural
advantages
expanded
service
of
process
and
broad
venue
in
some
way
evidences
an
intent
by
congress
to
relegate
all
civil
rico
claims
to
the
federal
courts.
those
procedure...
procedural
benefits
are
just
that,
procedural.
they're
not
substantive.
they
are
not
an
integral
part
of
rico.
and
it
is
wholly...
consistent
with
rico's
remedial
purposes
to
allow
plaintiffs
in
the
first
instance
to
choose
whether
they
want
to
avail
themselves
of
those
benefits
of
the
federal
courts
or
whether
to
pursue
their
claims
in
the
state
courts.
let
me
close
by
saying
that
this
court
has
consistently
and
emphatically
held
that
the
state
courts
are
competent
and
have
inherent
power
to
adjudicate
both
federal
statutory
and
constitutional
claims.
here
the
exercise
of
concurrent
state
court
jurisdiction
will
further,
not
frustrate,
the
redial
purposes
of
the
statute.
in
view
of
the
conceded
absence
of
a
statutory
directive
to
the
contrary
and
congress'
failure
even
to
consider
the
issue
during
its
legislative
deliberations,
it
is
clear
that
rico
does
not
fall
within
that
limited
class
of
cases
in
which
the
presumed
jurisdiction
of
the
state
courts
has
been
rebutted.
we,
therefore,
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
below.
thank
you.
