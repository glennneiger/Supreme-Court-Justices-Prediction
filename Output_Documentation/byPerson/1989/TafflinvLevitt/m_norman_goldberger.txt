mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
private
civil
treble
damage
remedy
provided
by
congress
in
the
racketeer
influenced
and
corrupt
organizations
act
known
as
rico
and
codified
at
18
u.s.c.
section
1964(c)
is
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
we
contend
that
section
1964(c)
is
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
this
court
in
the
gulf
offshore
case
set
forth
the
test
that
it
had
applied
in
determining
whether
any
given
congressional
enactment
is
within
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts.
analysis
must
always
begin
with
the
presumption
that
jurisdiction
is
concurrent.
congress,
however,
does
have
the
power
to
confer
exclusive
jurisdiction
on
the
federal
courts,
and
with
respect
with
each
congressional
enactment
the
question
is
whether
congress
intended
to
exercise
that
power.
this
court
in
gulf
offshore
set
forth
three
methods
by
which
the
congressional
intent
to
confer
exclusive
jurisdiction
could
be
discerned.
first,
that
congressional
intent
could
be
discerned
by
an
explicit
statutory
directive
that
jurisdiction
be
exclusive.
second,
the
congressional
intent
to
confer
exclusive
jurisdiction
could
be
discerned
by
an
unmistakable
implication
from
legislative
history.
third,
the
congressional
intent
to
confer
exclusive
jurisdiction
could
be
discerned
by
an
incompatibility
between
federal
interests
and
the
exercise
of
state
court
jurisdiction.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
so.
there
was
in
claflin
a
holding
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
could
be
determined
either
explicitly
or
implicitly,
and
also
a
reference
to
incompatibility
in
claflin.
i
think
gulf
offshore
and
claflin,
therefore,
are
entirely
compatible.
with
respect
to
section
1964(c)
there
is
no
explicit
statutory
directive
that
jurisdiction
be
exclusive.
there
is,
however,
an
unmistakable
implication
that
arises
from
the
legislative
history
of
section
1964(c)
as
well
as
exclusive
jurisdiction
can
also
be
seen
because
of
an
incompatibility
between
the
exercise--
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
--your
honor,
there
is
no
explicit
legislative
discussion
of
the
question
of
exclusive
jurisdiction.
there
is,
however,
a
clear
reliance
on
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
in
drafting
section
1964(c)
of
rico.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
your
honor--
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
--your
honor,
i
think
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
cannon
case
and
lorillard
v.
pons
that
when
congress
bases
one
statute
on
another
statute
it
is
presumed
to
know
what
this
court's
interpretation
is
for
a
statute.
and
absent
any
change
in
the
applicable
language
to
incorporate
that
language...
incorporate
those
precedents
in
the--
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
--i
think,
your
honor,
whether
this
court
was
on
the
right
track
with
respect
to
clayton
may
be
in
some
sense
beside
the
point
because
it
is
what
congress
knew
this
court
had
done
when
it
enacted
section
1964(c).
that
is,
congress
was
aware
of
the
court's
decisions
in
freeman
v.
bee
machine
company
and
in
general
investment
that
jurisdiction
was
exclusive.
thereby,
when
it
enacted
section
1964(c)
it
was
presumably
adopting
those
decisions
as
well,
for
it
made
no
change
in
the
statutory
language
between
the
clayton
act
and
section
1964(c).
moreover,
this
court
has
previously
recognized
these
two
similarities
between
section
1964(c)
and
section
4
in
interpreting
section
1964(c).
thus,
in
the
sedima
decision,
this
court
was
confronted
with
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
requirement
that
there
be
a
prior
predicate
act
conviction
before
a
successful
64...
1964(c)
action
could
be
brought.
in
part
relying
on
the
history
of
the
clayton
act
and
this
court's
interpretations
of
the
clayton
act,
the
court
concluded
that
it
was...
such
a
predicate
act
conviction
was
unnecessary.
the
court
made
similar
references
to
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
and
section
1964(c)
in
trying
to
adopt
the
proper
statute
of
limitations
in
the
malley-duff
decision.
and
also,
in
deciding
whether
rico
claims
were
arbitrable,
this
court
also
made
reference
to
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
and
noted
the
similarity
in
purpose
and
structure
between
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
and
section
1964(c).
this
congressional
intent
to
model
section
1964(c)
on
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
does
give
rise
to
an
implication
that
congress
intended
section
1964(c)
to
be
interpreted
in
the
same
way
as
section
4
of
the
clayton
act
and
to
provide
for
exclusive
jurisdiction.
this
congressional
intent
that
section
1964(c)
be
interpreted
in
the
same
way
is
buttressed
by
an
examination
of
rico's
underlying
policies
and
structures
which
are
incompatible
with
any
exercise
of
state
court
jurisdiction.
to
begin
with,
many
of
the
predicate
acts
which
form
the
heart
of
any
section
1964(c)
claim,
the
pattern
of
racketeering
activity,
are
federal
crimes.
congress
in
18
u.s.c.
section
3231
has
provided
that
jurisdiction
over
federal
offenses
shall
be
exclusively
federal.
at
least
one
of
the
purposes
of
section
3231
has
been
to
enable
there
to
be
an
orderly
development
of
the
federal
criminal
laws
and
to
provide
for
the
development
of
expertise
with
respect
to
those
federal
criminal
laws.
if
jurisdiction
is
held
to
be
concurrent,
in
every
rico
case
in
which
there
is
an
allegation
of
a
federal
predicate
offense
the
state
courts
will
necessarily
have
to
become
involved
in
the
interpretation
of
these
federal
criminal
offenses.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
your
honor,
it's
because
of
the
congressional
enactment
in
3131...
in
18
u.s.c.
section
3231...
committing
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
criminal
offenses
to
the
federal
courts
exclusively.
there
is
not
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
federal
criminal
offenses.
and
therefore,
congress
has
expressed
its
intent
as
to
how
federal
criminal
offenses
are
to
be
treated.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
your
honor,
if
you
take
as
a
given
that
section
3231
has
as
its
purpose
the
development
of
expertise
and
the
development
of...
the
orderly
development
of
the
federal
criminal
laws,
there
is
an
incompatibility.
it
arises
because
there
will
be
over
time
the
accretion
of
state
court
precedent
with
respect
to
federal
criminal
offenses,
which
today
does
not
exist.
the
predictability
of
the
federal
criminal
laws
will,
as
a
result,
necessarily
be
undercut,
and
the
congressional
purpose
in
enacting
section
3231
will
also
be
undercut.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
your
honor,
they
may
or
may
not
follow
federal
court
decisions.
they
certainly
will
follow
the
decisions
of
this
court,
bound
as
they
are
by
the
supremacy
clause.
but
they
may
not
necessarily
follow,
and
they
are
under
no
obligation
to
follow,
the
decisions
of
the
federal
circuits
or
the
federal
district
courts.
moreover,
there...
the
crimes
that
are
involved
as
predicate
acts
under
rico
may
well
be
still
in
the
stage
of
development.
this
court's
recent
holdings
with
respect
to
the
mail
fraud
statute
in
the
mcnally
decision
is
an
example
where
the
mail
fraud
statute
although
on
the
books
for
a
number
of
years
is
constantly
developing.
so
that
it's
not
that
all
the
law
is
certain
at
this
state
with
respect
to
any
of
these
criminal
offenses.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
your
honor,
it
may
be
that
it
was
fowled
up
under
uniform
federal
jurisdiction,
but
i
suggest
that
it
may
become
even
more
fouled
up,
to
use
your
terms,
if
the
state
courts
in
all
50
jurisdictions
are
permitted
to
issue
opinions
on
the
federal
criminal
laws
which
they
would
necessarily
have
to
do
in
the
context
of
ruling
on
motions
for
summary
judgment,
in
the
context
of
jury
instructions,
and
even
in
the
context
of
discovery
motions
as
they
discuss
the
relevancy
of
various
discovery
which
is
sought.
in
addition
to
the
incompatibility
which
is
provided
by
the
use
of
the
federal
criminal
laws
in
the
rico
statute,
incompatibility
also
arises
because
of
the
broad
nature
of
rico
itself.
this
court
has
noted
in
sedima
and
the
recent
h.j.
decision
that
rico
was
deliberately
crafted
by
congress
as
a
broad
statute
so
as
to
catch
within
its
parameters
all
types
of
repetitive
criminal
conduct
which
was
invasive
of
the
business
community.
necessarily
the
terms
used
by
congress
were
somewhat
vague
and
broad
when
the
statute
was
drafted.
as
a
result,
the
various
terms
in
rico,
such
as
enterprise
and
pattern,
have
received
what
this
court
called
in
h.j.
a
plethora
of
opinions
and
the
concurrence
called
a
kaleidoscope
of
views.
if
the
state
courts
are
permitted
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
rico,
civil
rico
actions,
this
plethora
of
opinions
over
many
of
the
issues
still
remaining
under
rico
and
even
under
the
pattern
issue,
which
this
court
has
now
left
to
basically
a
case-by-case
analysis,
will
increase
and
the
natural
synergy
of
the
federal
system
is
not
available
to
harmonize
the
various
outstanding
issues
and
the
opinions
which
may
issue
with
respect
to
these
various
outstanding
issues.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
your
honor,
that...
that
statute
and
perhaps
the
antitrust
laws.
and
it
is
no
coincidence
that
section
1964(c)
is
based
on
section
4
of
the
clayton
act.
both
were
deliberately
broad
attempts
to
reach
out
and
attack
problems
invasive
of
the
national
economy.
finally,
the
procedural
devices
which
are
available
to
litigants
in
section
1964(c)
actions
provided
by
congress
in
connection
with
those
actions
are
simply
unavailable
in
state
courts.
thus,
section
1965(b)
provides
for
a
nationwide
service
of
process.
section
1965(d)
provides
for
expanded
subpoena
power.
section
1965(a)
provides
for
expanded
venue.
and
by
their
terms,
those
provisions
are
not
applicable
to
the
state
courts.
as
a
result,
the
congress
in
enacting
rico
recognized
that
the
patterns
of
criminal
conduct
which
it
sought
to
reach
out
and
attack
were
in
many
instances
multi-state
and
nationwide
in
scope.
it
therefore
provided
plaintiffs
with
nationwide
procedural
devices
to
attack
this
nationwide
problem.
at
least
one
of
the
purposes
of
section
1964(c)
was
to
create
plaintiffs
who
would
become
private
to
the
attorney
general
and
assist
in
the
extirpation
of
what
congress
saw
as
the
evil
which
it
sought
to
address
in
rico,
namely
the
invasiveness
of
organized
criminal
activity
into
the
legitimate
business
world.
if
state
courts
are
to
exercise
jurisdiction,
plaintiffs
will
not
be
able
to
utilize
all
the
procedures
provided
by
congress
and
therefore--
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
--your
honor,
freeman
v.
bee
machine
company
and
general
investment
are
the
two
cases
that--
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
--your
honor,
in...
i
believe
it's
footnote
4,
but
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
--six,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry,
it's
note
6.
taken
together,
the
congressional
reliance
on
section
4
of
the
clayton
act,
the
modeling
of
section
1964(c)
on
that
section,
this
court's
interpretation
of
section
4
as
providing
exclusive
jurisdiction...
create
the
unmistakable
implication
that
congress
intended
jurisdiction
under
section
1964
(c)
to
be
exclusive.
this
conclusion
is
buttressed
by
the
incompatibility
which
arises
if
state
courts
exercise
jurisdiction
because
of
their
interpretation
of
federal
criminal
offenses
which
congress
has
provided...
has
provided
shall
only
be
in
the
hands
of
federal
courts
under
section
3231,
and
because
of
the
procedural
devices
provided
by
congress,
and,
in
addition,
because
of
the
very
broad
nature
of
rico
itself.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
just
briefly.
first,
respondents
place
reliance
on
the
section
1983
cases
which
hold
that
jurisdiction
is
concurrent
under
that
act
and
on
the
dowd
box
decision.
both
of
those
cases
are
distinguishable.
in
the
case
of
section
1983
this
court
in
patsy
v.
board
of
regents
and
felder
v.
casey
engaged
in
an
extensive
analysis
which
demonstrated
that
congress
in
enacting
section
1983
in
fact
had
an
affirmative
intent
to
retain
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
section
1983
claims.
the
same
is
true
with...
respect
to
the
dowd
box
decision.
the
court
there
engaged
in
analysis
of
section
301
and
determined
that
congress
in
enacting
that
section
intended
to
expand,
not
to
contract,
the
four
that
were
available
for
section
301
actions.
in
addition,
the
respondents
indicate
that
there
is
congressional
history
which
shows
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
adapt
all
of
the
baggage
of
the
clayton
act
to
section
1964(c)
actions.
there
is
some
legislative
history
that
supports
that,
but
as
justice
marshall
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
the
sedima
case
and
as
other
courts
have
pointed
out
as
well,
there
is
a
limitation
in
that
legislative
history
which
indicates
that
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
importing
into
section
1964(c)
concepts
of
antitrust
standing
and
antitrust
injury.
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
was
concerned
in
any
way
of
limiting
this
court's
holding
in
freeman
and
general
investment.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
your
honor,
in
terms
of
this
case,
i
think
that's
the
best
we've
got
because
congress
deliberately
did
model
section
1964(c)--
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
--on
section--
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
--yes,
your
honor.
oh,
no,
there's
another
decision.
in
the
marrese
decision,
this
court
reaffirmed
that
holding
and
cited--
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
--yes,
your
honor,
we
did.
it
is...
it
appears
at...
marrese
is...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
marrese...
marrese
appears
at...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
--thank
you.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
it's
marrese
v.
american
academy
of
orthopedic
surgeons,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
it's
470
u.s.
373.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
it
appears
in
the
respondents'
brief,
your
honor,
on
page
25.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
i
think
so...
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
it's...
it's
general
investment--
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
--general
investment
and
freeman
v.
bee
machine.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
260
u.s.
261.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
yes,
your
honor.
the
seventh
circuit
has
in
two
opinions--
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
--suggested
that
perhaps
the
clayton
act
decisions
were
not--
mr.
m.
norman
goldberger
--the
best-decided
decisions.
but
i
think
the
point
here,
to
reiterate,
is
not
whether
the
clayton
act
decisions
were
the
best-decided
decisions,
but
rather
than
congress
in
enacting
section
1964(c)
was
aware
of
those
decisions
and
made
no
change
in
applicable
language
when
it
enacted
section
1964(c).
finally,
i
would
just
like
to
address
the
contention
that
rico
actions...
there's
nothing
anomalous
about
state
court
judges
interpreting
federal
law
since
federal
court
judges
will
be
interpreting
state
law
into
rico
actions,
which
is,
i
understand,
the
arguments
the
respondents
have
made.
congress
made
a
choice
when
it
enacted
rico.
it
made
a
choice
to
in
fact
federalize
some
state
criminal
laws.
it
anticipated,
therefore,
that
federal
court
judges
would
in
fact
be
interpreting
state
criminal
laws.
it
did
not
anticipate
that
federal
laws
would
be
interpreted
in
the
state...
federal
criminal
laws
would
be
interpreted
in
the
state
courts
and
that
somehow
section
3231
would
be
changed
by
the
enactment
of
section
1964(c).
for
all
the
reasons
i've
just
stated
and
the
reasons
i
stated
in
my
opening
remarks,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
below.
