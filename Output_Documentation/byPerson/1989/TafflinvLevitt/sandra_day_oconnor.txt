justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fourth
circuit.
the
question
presented
is
whether
state
courts
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
civil
actions
brought
under
the
racketeer
influence
and
corrupt
organizations
act
commonly
referred
to
as
rico.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
state
courts
do
have
concurrent
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
such
claims.
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
to
suggest
that
congress
has
by
affirmative
enactment
divested
the
state
courts
of
such
jurisdiction.
the
legislative
history
likewise
does
not
unmistakably
imply
that
congress
so
intended.
we
find
no
clear
incompatibility
between
concurrent
jurisdictions
and
the
federal
interest
underlying
the
statute.
there
is
no
significant
danger
of
inconsistent
application
of
federal
criminal
law
because
federal
courts
retain
authority
over
the
interpretation
and
application
of
such
laws.
we
have
full
faith
in
the
ability
of
state
courts
to
handle
the
complexities
of
civil
rico
actions,
particularly,
since
many
rico
cases
involve
asserted
violations
of
state
law.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
the
decision
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
justice
white
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
scalia
has
also
filed
a
concurring
opinion
which
justice
kennedy
has
joined.
