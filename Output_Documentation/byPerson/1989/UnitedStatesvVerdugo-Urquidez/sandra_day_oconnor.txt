well,
mr.
robbins,
i
take
it
your
fallback
position
is
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
mexican
law
was
followed
in
making
this
search.
and
you
also
make
the
argument
that
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
united
states
constitutional...
you
say
that
the
u.s.
constitution
doesn't
apply
here...
at
least
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
anything
at
all
limit
searches
by
u.s.
officials
beyond
our
borders
of
people
that
we're
going
to
then
prosecute,
and,
if
so,
what?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
your
argument,
i
guess,
if
our
officials
could
get
away
with
it,
they
could
just
not
ask
anybody
and
break
into
the
house
in
mexicali
and
do
what
they
wanted.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
your
position,
i
take
it,
would
be
the
same.
that
that
evidence
could
be
used?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
just
entered
the
house
without
any
authority
from
anybody
and
took
the
evidence?
does
that
shock
your
conscience?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
suppose
we
think
the
warrant
requirement
does
not
extend
to
searches
beyond
our
borders,
would
we
then
have
to...
if
the
fourth
amendment
applies...
look
to
a
reasonableness
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
would
you
measure
that?
it
wouldn't
necessarily
be
measured
by
the
law
of
a
foreign
country.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
understand
your
argument.
now,
how
about
getting
to
my
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
pancer,
in
your
brief
there
is
some
argument
to
the
effect
that
this
evidence
was
taken
after
the
respondent
was
in
the
united
states
and
it
was
taken
from
a
briefcase,
something
to
that
effect.
were
those
arguments
raised
below?
