justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
mean
even
if
the
house
happens
to
be
owned
by
a
citizen
of
the
united
states?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
way
you
put
it,
it
wouldn't
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but,
you
know,
if
you
want
to...
if
you
are
trying
a
person
in
the
southern
district
of
california
and
you
want
to
search
his
house
in
tucson,
you
don't
get
a
warrant
from...
who
do
you
get
the
warrant
from?
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
territorial
then,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
territorial.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
restricts
it
in
the
sense
that
a
warrant
issued
in
southern
california
wouldn't
authorize
a
search
in
tucson.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
what
the
district
court
found?
justice
byron
r.
white
why...
what
do
you
mean
good
faith
isn't
an
issue
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
there
was
good
faith?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
leon
is
limited
to
those
situations
where
you
have
a
warrant
that
was
issued
by
a
magistrate?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
they
found
that...
they
thought
that...
the
court
thought
that
the
agents
knew
this
man
was
corrupt?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
know
he
didn't
have
any
authority
to
do
what
he
was
doing?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
that
wasn't
the
basis
for
the
ninth
circuit's
holding.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
your
rule
would
apply
to
an
arrest
or
a
detention
in
mexico
of
an
alien
by
united
states
police
which
would
be
illegal
in
the
united
states...
would
they
have
to
have
probable
cause
in
united
states
terms
to
detain
him?
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--let's
assume
they
detain
him,
not
only
detain
him
but
they
bring
him
to
the
united
states.
in
the
meanwhile,
they
get
some
admissions
from
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
to
the
admissions
obtained
from
him
in
mexico?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
with
a
treaty...
they
make
a
treaty
with
mexico
and
they
agree
that
searches
can
be
made
of
properties
in
mexico
pursuant
to
procedures
that
wouldn't
even
come
close
to
complying
with
the
fourth
amendment.
do
you
think
that
treaty
is
valid?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
of
course,
you
don't
need
to
be
seizing
evidence
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment
by
entering
a
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
enter
a
house
illegally
and
you're
there
wrongfully
and
you
tip
over
a
television
and
break
it
and
you
get
sued.
