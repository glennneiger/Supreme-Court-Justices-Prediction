justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
constitution
control
what
united
states
officials
do
when
they're
abroad
generally?
or
never?
or
sometimes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
and
what
does
it
depend
on?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
in
order
to
make
this
complete,
the
third
amendment
says
no
soldier
shall
in
time
of
peace
be
quartered
in
any
house.
and
i
assume
that
under
your
semantic
analysis
it
does
apply
overseas.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
fact,
counsel,
it
would
be
rather
odd,
wouldn't
it,
for
this
court
to
require
the
issuance
of
a
warrant
that's
not
permitted
by
the
rules?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the...
well
let's
look
at
that.
doesn't
the
property
have
to
be
located
in
the
district
where
the
magistrate
or
the
state
court
sits?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
take
it
that
if
foreign
police
officials
ask
american
dea
agents
to
cooperate
with
them
in
a
search,
under
your
view
the
american
agent
has
to
get
a
warrant
before
he
does
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no.
a
search
in
a
foreign
country.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
they
don't
know.
again,
would
you
advise
that
officer
that
he's
acting
illegally
if
he
cooperated
with
foreign
police
in
search
of
a
foreign
residence
without...
and
he
has
no
warrant?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
violation
is
the
introduction
of
the
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
asking
whether
there
is
a
violation.
if
you
are
a
law
enforcement
official
who
is
conscientious
about
his
constitutional
obligations,
you
would
not
assist
foreign
police
unless
you
had
a
warrant
from
a
united
states
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
in
your
view,
the
fourth
amendment
is
limited
to
those
instances
where
there
is
a
search
and
the
evidence
is
brought
to
a
united
states
court...
there
is
no
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there
is--
--well,
what
if
a
plaintiff--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
way
we
have
the
case
now
is
that
there
can
be
no
cooperation
with
foreign
police
officials
by
american
police
officials
unless
they
have
a
warrant.
that's
your
position?
