paul

mr.
robbins,
may
i
just
ask
this
question?
did
that
mexican
official
have
the
authority
to
authorize
a
search
like
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
in
mexico
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
has
full
authority
to
conduct
whatever
searches
it
thinks
necessary.
it
doesn't
have
to
have
any
warrant
or
judicial
participation
in--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--is
that
your
submission?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
said
with
the
full
authority
of
the
mexican
official...
i
take
it
you're
meaning
it
was
clearly
in
compliance
with
mexican
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
would
it
matter
if
they
asked
the
corner
policeman,
do
you
mind
if
we
go
in
and
search
this
house?
or,
would
that
do...
be
any
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
we
don't
know
whether
mexican
law
requires
anything
like
a
warrant
procedure
or
judicial
participation--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
authority
to
conduct
the
search
of
a
private
home.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
i'm
really
asking...
you
emphasized
in
your
presentation
that
it
was
done
with
the
permission
of
the
mexican
authorities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i'm
wondering
if
that
is
essential
to
your
position.
and,
if
so,
do
they
have
to
be
mexican
authorities
who
had
the
authority
to
grant
the
permission?
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
just
wonder
how
relevant
it
is
to
the
analysis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
somebody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but,
mr.
robbins,
there's
a
big
difference
between
the
preamble
which
says,
"we,
the
people",
and
"the
people"
used
in
the
fourth
amendment
which
speaks
in
the
third
person,
which
may
suggest
that
there
third
party
beneficiaries
to
the
compact
that
you
described.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
how
does
the
word
people
tell
us
who
the
third
party
beneficiaries
are?
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
they
rejected
those
drafts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
rejected
those
drafts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
robbins,
may
i
just
ask
one
other
question?
isn't
there
also
an
intermediate
position
that
even
if
it
does
not
generally
apply...
you
say
this
gentleman
had
no
ongoign
relationship
with
the
united
states,
but
if
you're
ultimately
successful,
he
will
have
an
ongoign
relationship
with
the
united
states--
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
he
certainly
has
some
relationship
and
was
physically
present
in
the
united
states
at
the
time
of
the
search.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
point
i
really
am
making
is
that
your
argument
perhaps
is
less
strong
in
a
case
in
which
the
search
took
place
after
the
owner
of
the
premises
was
physically
in
custody
and
under
indictment
in
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
it's
the
kind
of
presence
that
gives
rise
to
certain
constitutional
rights,
such
as
the
right
to
counsel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
right
to
object
to
the
introduction
of
illegally-seized
evidence
is
a
trial
right,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
didn't
one
of
the
officers
secure
an
automobile?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
didn't
one
of
the
officers
secure
an
automobile?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean
one
of
the
mexican
officers.
