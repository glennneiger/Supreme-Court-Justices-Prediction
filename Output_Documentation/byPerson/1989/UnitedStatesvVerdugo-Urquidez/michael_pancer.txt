mr.
michael
pancer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
exact
question
presented
to
this
court
is
whether
or
not
a
person
who
is
incarcerated
in
the
united
states,
facing
charges
in
the
united
states,
has
a
fourth
amendment
interest
in
their
residence
outside
the
united
states
when
a
decision
to
search
that
residence
is
made
by
a
united
states
agent
in
the
united
states
and
he
is
hunting
for
evidence
to
be
used
for
the
very
charges
that
the
person
incarcerated
is
facing
in
the
united
states.
that
is
the
specific
question
and
we
are
mindful
of
the
rule
of
this
court
enunciated
by
justice
frankfurter
in
reid
versus
covert
that
says
that
this
court
will
not
formulate
a
rule
of
constitutional
law
broader
than
required
by
the
precise
facts
to
which
it
is
to
be
applied.
mr.
michael
pancer
i
think
that
the
precise
rule
that
we
could
draw
from
the
case...
yes,
my
answer
would
be
yes,
that
the
precise
rule
we
could
draw
from
that
case
is
that
since,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
exigency
to
prevent
the
officers
from
getting
a
warrant,
they
should
have
got
a
warrant.
that's
how
i
understand
the
rule.
i
don't
understand
it
to
be
as
broad
as
counsel
for
the
government.
mr.
michael
pancer
i
don't
think--
mr.
michael
pancer
--i
don't
think
it's
a
difficult
question.
the
defendant,
mr.
verdugo,
was
in
custody
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
the
agent,
when
he
made
his
decision
to
search,
was
present
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
there
was
a
magistrate
present.
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
assigned
to
prosecute
mr.
verdugo
was
also
in
the
southern
district
of
california.
i
think--
mr.
michael
pancer
--no,
but
if
you
want
to
go
to
a
magistrate...
and
that's
how
i
understood
the
question...
what
magistrate
would
you
logically
go
to
or
which
judge...
i
would
think
that
since
the
agent,
the
defendant,
and
the
prosecuting
authority
were
all
in
the
southern
district
of
california,
it
would
certainly
make
sense
to
go
there.
now,
there
could
be--
mr.
michael
pancer
--well,
also,
i
think--
mr.
michael
pancer
--i
think
they
would
be
very
annoyed
if
that
document
was
presented
to
them
by
the
agents
as
something
that
said
this
gives
us
the
right
vis-a-vis
the
government
of
the
republic
of
mexico
to
take
action
in
mexico.
they'd
have
every
right
to
be
outraged.
no.
all
we're
saying
that
the
warrant
does
is
create
a
relationship
between
the
evidence
and
the
court
in
the
united
states.
it
can't
authorize
the
agents
to
search
if
the
mexican
authorities
don't
want
them
to
or
don't
give
them
permission.
but
it
can
say
that
this
search
is
legal
according
to
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
and
that's
all
we're
saying
that
the
warrant
accomplishes.
clearly,
it
can't
force
the
mexicans
to
let
the
agents
search.
mr.
michael
pancer
in
that
sense
it
is
different,
but
requiring
a
warrant
fulfills
the
same
purposes--
mr.
michael
pancer
--as
having
a
warrant
in
the
united
states.
clearly
because--
mr.
michael
pancer
--it
certainly
has
the
difference
that
the
justice
has
mentioned.
mr.
michael
pancer
no,
i
think
it
is
permitted
pursuant
to
rule
41.
rule--
mr.
michael
pancer
--that
would
be
true
if
we
just
looked
at
rule
41(a).
but
that
rule...
i
think
in
the
new
york
telephone
case...
has
been
held
to
have
a
broader
application
and
the
court
has
been
deemed
to
have
inherent
powers
to
issue
orders
that
will
accomplish
a
rational
aim
of
the
court.
for
example,
there
was
no
specific
provision,
as
i
understand
the
new
york
telephone
company
case,
that
permitted
the
court
to
issue
a
warrant
for
a
pen
register
and
to
require
the
phone
company
to
help
out
and
lend
equipment
so
that
a
pen
register
could
be
affixed
to
pay
telephones.
but,
yet,
rule
41
was
read
not
to
limit
what
the
courts
may
do
but
to
spell
out
some
of
the
kinds
of
warrants
that
a
magistrate
could
issue
or
a
district
court
could
issue,
but
not
to
limit
it,
and
that
the
court
certainly
would
have
inherent
power
to
issue
such
an
order.
the
same
i
think
was
true
in
the
torres
case,
which
was
cited
by
the
district
court
in
this
case,
in
which
the
law
enforcement
wished
to
have
an
order
for
indoor
surveillance
and
there
was
just
no
specific
provision
but
it
was
held
to
be
encompassed
by
rule
41
and
by
the
inherent
power
of
the
court
to
issue
orders
to
accomplish
irrational
aims.
mr.
michael
pancer
there
is
no
case
that
says
that
they
can
or
cannot.
but
the
reading
of
the
language,
i
think,
in
the
new
york
telephone
company
case
and
the
reading
of
the
language
in
torres
seems...
they
didn't
seem
to
be
concerned
with
a
problem
of
territorial
in
this
because
it
didn't
come
up
in
those
instances.
but
the
language
of
the
case
seems
to
say
that
it
wouldn't
matter
that
the
territorial
limitation
mentioned
in
rule
41(a)
wouldn't
prevent
the
court,
due
to
its
inherent
power,
to
issue
an
order
outside
of
the
territory.
mr.
michael
pancer
it
would
be
the
magistrate
in
tucson
or
the
court
in
tucson?
mr.
michael
pancer
i
think
because
rule
41(a)
talks
about
specifically--
mr.
michael
pancer
--pardon
me?
mr.
michael
pancer
rule
41(a)
is.
i
only
mentioned
the
other
case
to
say
that
i
don't
think
it
restricts
the
court...
rule
41(a)
restricts
the
court
in
issuing
orders
or
else--
mr.
michael
pancer
--that's
correct,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
restrict
a
court
from
issuing
a
warrant
to
search
or
a
finding
of
probable
cause
to
search
a
residence
in
mexicali
in
mexico.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
rule
that
says
that
it
would,
and
i
think
the
holding
of
new
york
telephone
indicates
that
the
court
would
have
that
power.
but
i
think
i
should
hasten
to
add,
if
this
court
finds
that
the
warrant
requirement
applies,
the
fact
that
the
united
states
congress
has
not
set
up
a
system
whereby
a
warrant
could
be
obtained,
is
certainly
not
a
defense
for
the
government
in
obtaining
a
warrant.
if
a
warrant
is
required,
then
the
government
must
get
a
warrant
or
they
must
not
search.
i
am
suggesting
there
is
a
way
they
could
have
done
that.
mr.
michael
pancer
there
is
no
warrant.
mr.
michael
pancer
justice
marshall,
there
were
no
papers.
they
used
no
papers.
agent
bowen,
the
agent
who
decided
to
search,
sat
in
his
office
and
said,
i'm--
mr.
michael
pancer
--whether
or
not
they
should
be
required
to
get
a
warrant,
and
we're
saying
that
they
should
have
been
required
to
obtain
a
warrant.
but
there
was
no
warrant
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
pancer
yes.
mr.
michael
pancer
that
the...
it
would
specifically
identify
the
places
to
be
searched,
list
specifically
the
items
that
could
be
seized,
and
specifically
set--
mr.
michael
pancer
--well,
in
fact
it
would,
because
the
article
16
of
the
constitution
of
the
republic
of
mexico
is
very
similar
to
our
own
warrant
requirement
and
specifically
requires
that
a
search
warrant
be
obtained.
i
disagree
with
counsel
when
they
say
that
this
search
was
authorized
in
mexico.
it
was
not
because
no
warrant
was
obtained,
and
we
submitted
an
affidavit
that
is
part
of
the
record
in
this
case--
mr.
michael
pancer
--well,
they
checked
with
another
law
enforcement
official
and
they
said
we'd
like
to
search
and
this
fellow
police
officer
said,
sure,
we'll
help
you
out.
that's
basically
what
happened.
but
nobody
told
them
that
this
was
legal.
it's
just
another
police
officer
that
says,
sure,
we'll
help
you
out
and
we'll
do
the
search.
according
to
the
constitution
of
mexico,
the
search
was
not
legal
and
the
agents
were
guilty
of
the
crime
of
excess,
according
to
the
laws
of
mexico.
mr.
michael
pancer
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
pancer
no
civil
suit
was
ever
filed
in
mexico
that
i
know
about.
mr.
michael
pancer
no...
no...
i
know
of
no
civil
suit.
mr.
michael
pancer
he
did
not
seek
to
sue
u.s.
agents.
of
course,
he
was
incar--
mr.
michael
pancer
--i
don't
believe
that
he
did.
he
has
an
attorney
in
mexico.
but
i
don't
believe
that
he
did.
of
course,
he
was
here
incarcerated
in
the
united
states
well
before
the
search.
mr.
michael
pancer
well--
mr.
michael
pancer
--no.
no,
it...
well,
in
the
peterson
case
that
was...
the
ninth
circuit
case...
that
was
one
of
the
things
looked
at
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
search
complied
with
the
fourth
amendment.
but
if
we're
looking...
and
i'm
clearly
urging
this
court
to
say
that
a
warrant
must
be
obtained
when
the
sanctity
of
a
home
is
being
violated,
that
there
has
never
been
a
broad
rule
from
this
court
saying
that
homes
can
be
entered
without
a
warrant.
mr.
michael
pancer
yes.
well,
this
search
we
are
saying
for
many
reasons
was
not
a
reasonable
search
if
we
are
not
going
to
apply
the
warrant
requirement.
it
was
not
reasonable,
we
are
saying,
because
of
law
enforcement
official
agent
bowen
made
that
decision
on
his
own,
without
contacting
anybody
from
the
department
of
justice,
without
contacting
the
assistant
united
states
attorney
who
was
assigned
to
prosecute
mr.
verdugo
in
the
southern
district.
he
even
said
that
he
didn't
contact
his
own
supervisor,
but
had
he
contacted
his
supervisor
and
his
supervisor
said
no,
he
still
might
have
conducted
the
search.
he
never
contacted
any--
mr.
michael
pancer
--well,
it
was
considered
by
the
district
court
in
that
had
he
contacted
some
official,
he
might
have
realized,
one,
that
there
was
a
warrant
requirement
in
mexico
that
he
could
have
complied
with;
he
might
have
learned
that
as
far
as
the
department
of
justice
is
concerned
maybe
a
warrant
or
an
order
of
probable
cause
should
be
obtained
here.
and
it
doesn't
seem
that
we
just
want
a
law
enforcement
official
to
be
able
on
his
own
to
put
together
a
raiding
party
and
go
into
mexico,
ask
for
help
and
search.
but
that--
mr.
michael
pancer
--well,
we
are
saying
that
he
was
wrong
objectively
in
that
he
didn't
comply
at
least
with
the
warrant
requirements--
mr.
michael
pancer
--we
urge
that
had
he
consulted,
he
might
have
learned
that
there
was
a
warrant
requirement
in
mexico.
so
in
that
sense
we
think
it's
on
point.
he
never
contacted--
mr.
michael
pancer
--okay.
he
never
contacted
any
judicial
officer
in
the
republic
of
mexico,
only
other
law
enforcement
officials.
these
are
all
reasons
why
we
think
that
the
search
was
unreasonable.
he
enlisted
the
aid
of
a
corrupt
mexican
federal
judicial
police
officer
to
go
on
this
raiding
party
that--
mr.
michael
pancer
--we
presented
evidence
at
the
district
court
from
two
other
agents
who
were
also
there
that
this
agent
was
corrupt,
this
mfjp
commandante.
we
attempted
to
present
more
evidence--
mr.
michael
pancer
--no,
it's
what
the
agents
testified
to.
the
district
court
would
not
let
us
pursue
that
any
further,
saying
that
this
went
to
an
issue
of
good
faith
and
good
faith
was
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
on
this
raiding
party
that
went
to
search
in
mexico
was
a
fugitive.
mr.
michael
pancer
i
say
the
district
court
found
that
good
faith
was
not
an
issue
so
we
weren't--
mr.
michael
pancer
--no.
the
court
found
that,
one,
there
was
not
good
faith,
but
that
good
faith
was
not
relevant
because
we
don't
have
the
situation
as
we
do
in
leon
where
the
agents
were
relying
on
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate.
we
have
a
far
different
situation.
so
the
court
found,
one,
that
good
faith
was
not
relevant
but
if
it
were--
mr.
michael
pancer
--no.
clearly
it
is
not,
but
the
court
found
that
the
reasoning
in
leon
would
not
apply
when
the
officers,
as
they
were
in
this
case,
relied
on
the
word
of
this
mexican
commandante.
he
felt
that
they
did
not
have
a
good
faith...
the
court
found--
mr.
michael
pancer
--two
of
the
agents
testified
that
they
knew
that
he
was
corrupt.
we
were
getting
into
when
they
learned
of
his
corruption
when
the
court
cut
off
that
inquiry
because
the
government
objected
to
it.
mr.
michael
pancer
no,
just
that
he
was
corrupt.
mr.
michael
pancer
a
person
who
was
willing
to
take,
in
this
context,
bribes
to
do
illegal
activities
is
the
way
it
was
presented.
mr.
michael
pancer
no,
no,
this...
no,
we
are
only...
this
was
only
discussed
in
the
district
court
in
the
context
of
a
good
faith
argument
by
the
agent.
mr.
michael
pancer
it
was
suggested
that
prior
to
the
search
that
u.s.
law
enforcement
officials
who
were
involved
in
this
search
were
involved
with
getting
police
officers
in
mexico
to
engage
in
the
illegal
action
of
kidnapping
mr.
verdugo
and
sending
him
back
to
the
united
states
from
which--
mr.
michael
pancer
--it
relates
to
the
kinds
of
activities
in
which
the
u.s.
law
enforcement
agents
were
engaged
and
when
did
those
activities
in
connection
with
the
search,
i.e.,
the
apprehension
of
mr.
verdugo,
was
to
get
the
law
enforcement
there
to
commit
an
act
illegal
in
mexico
for
which
charges
were
issued
in
mexico.
those
officials
then
came
to
the
united
states...
those
mexican
police
officials,
where
they're
being
protected.
that's
part
of
the
record
of
the
district
court.
mr.
michael
pancer
it
proves
that
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
officers
could
rely
in
good
faith
on
a
neutral
and
detached
magistrate,
but
it
is
far
another
thing
to
say
that
they
have
some
good
faith
reliance
on
a
person
they
know
to
be
corrupt.
in
addition,
as
i
say,
on
this
raiding
party
that
went
to
search
was
a
fugitive
from
justice
in
the
united
states.
and
he
was
a
fugitive
from
a
companion
case
to
the
case
in
which
the
defendant
in
this
case
was
charged.
mr.
michael
pancer
no.
i
am
trying
to
list
all
of
the
things
that
came
out
that
we
think
made
this
search
unreasonable,
responding
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
one
of
the
houses
searched
in
mexico
was
the
wrong
house.
it
wasn't
the
home
of
mr.
verdugo.
our
agents
went
inside
the
residence
of
a
family
named
tofoya.
in
that
home,
mrs.
tofoya
was
intimidated
by
mexican
officials
when
she
first
said
she
did
not
know
who
mr.
verdugo
was
and
that
he
didn't
live
here.
and
after
a
search
of
that
residence,
which
was
the
wrong
residence,
and
some
intimidation,
they
found...
mr.
tofoya
was
able
to
lead
the
agents
to
where
mr.
verdugo's
residence
in
san
felipe
was.
the--
mr.
michael
pancer
--we
would
have
no
remedy
if
that
were
to
happen.
mr.
michael
pancer
i
think
that's
clear.
mr.
michael
pancer
well,
i
think
we'd
have
some
remedy
as
to
the
admissions.
as
to
him
being
in
the
united
states--
mr.
michael
pancer
--yes,
i
think
that
there...
and
i
don't
have
the
case
before
me,
but
there
are
cases
that
say
the
fifth
amendment
would
apply
to
the
questioning
of
a
person,
whether
it
took
place
in
this
country
or
not.
but
there
would
be
no
remedy
as
to
his
being
here
in
the
united
states.
mr.
michael
pancer
i
think
that
there
have
been
cases
that
distinguished
times
of
war
enemy
alienage
from
a
situation
in
which
we--
mr.
michael
pancer
--i
would
not--
mr.
michael
pancer
--no,
i'm
sorry...
i
would
not
say
that.
but
i
believe
that
the
johnson
case,
which
was
cited
by
counsel,
turns
on
the
issue
of
enemy
alienage.
and
that
we're
not
disputing
that...
those
cases.
mr.
michael
pancer
well,
i...
as
a
general
proposition,
i
would
agree
with
that...
however,
i
will
recognize
there
are
cases
that
are
to
the
contrary
and
i'm
thankful
that
we
need
a
much
more
limited
rule
to
prevail
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
pancer
well,
to
the
extent
they
would
try
to
come
back
with
evidence
from
that
raid
and
use
it
in
the
united
states,
i
think
reid
versus
covert
in
addition--
mr.
michael
pancer
--well,
i
think
it
does
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
michael
pancer
i
would
say
it
certainly
viola--
mr.
michael
pancer
--i
would
agree.
mr.
michael
pancer
no,
i
don't
think
the
treaty
would
be
valid
if
it
contradicts
the
fourth
amendment.
but,
again,
i
don't
need
to
go
that
far
to
prevail
here.
there
is...
there
is
no
such
treaty.
in
fact,
there
is
the
mexican
constitution,
which
is
akin
to
our
own
in
terms
of
what
it
requires
from
searching
officers.
this...
for
the
first
time
during--
mr.
michael
pancer
--a
search
in
this
country?
mr.
michael
pancer
if
he
intends
to
use
the
evidence
in
the
united
states...
we're
talking
about
a
situation--
mr.
michael
pancer
--not
necessarily
because
i
think
the
fourth
amendment,
by
case
law,
and
by
its
terms
applies
when
officers...
most
specifically
when
officers
are
seeking
to
get
evidence
to
introduce
in
the
united
states
against
a
defendant
in
the
united
states.
many
cases
have
mentioned
that
that
is
the
specific
protection
that--
mr.
michael
pancer
--no,
the
violation...
well,
the
remedy
for
the
violation
is
to
prevent--
mr.
michael
pancer
--or
unless
i
did
not
intend
to
obtain
evidence
to
bring
back
to
the
united
states,
i
think
that
i
would
have
to
say--
mr.
michael
pancer
--in
a
foreign--
mr.
michael
pancer
--in
a
foreign
country--
mr.
michael
pancer
--i
would
think
that
if
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
defendant's
rights,
then
he
would
have
the
right
to
sue.
i
hope
i
have
properly
answered
justice
kennedy's
question.
i
think
that
the
joint
venture
doctrine
determines
when
there
is
sufficient
involvement
of
u.s.
officials
to
call
the
fourth
amendment
into
play.
and
if
it
is
a
joint
venture
which
is
ordinarily
the
situation
when
u.s.
agents
are
seeking
evidence
to
bring
back
to
the
united
states,
then
there
is
a
violation
if
the
search
is
unreasonable
or
if
no
warrant
is
obtained.
mr.
michael
pancer
no.
mr.
michael
pancer
if
i
said
to
the
contrary,
then
i
misspoke
myself.
clearly,
there
is
a
violation
when
the
illegal
search
takes
place
or
when
the
joint
venture
takes
place
without
a
warrant
or
without
probable
cause.
mr.
michael
pancer
no
joint
venture.
that
would
be
correct.
absent
exigency.
now,
if
our
agents
are
up
in
the
mountains
of
columbia
and
there's
no
telephone
handy
and
they
have
to
make
a
decision
to
search
very
quickly,
then
clearly
it
would
be
reasonable
for
them
not
to
get
a
warrant.
and
that
may
be
true
in
many
situations.
mr.
michael
pancer
i
think
that
they
could
call--
mr.
michael
pancer
--well,
as
i
say,
in
that
situation
if
they
could
call,
then
i
would
think
that
they
would
call
a
magistrate
in
the
jurisdiction
in
which
they
intend
to
bring
the
evidence,
the
reason
for
the
joint
venture,
or
in
washington,
d.c.
or
contact
some
judge.
i
don't
think
it's
key
where.
if
they're
required
to
get
a
warrant,
they
can
get
the...
they
must--
mr.
michael
pancer
--i
think
that
the
government
would
concede
that
mr.
verdugo,
here
in
the
united
states
at
the
time
this
search
took
place,
had
the
benefit
of
every
other
one
of
the
bill
of
rights.
he
had
the
first
amendment
protection,
he
had
the
fifth
amendment
protection,
the
sixth
amendment.
but,
mr.
verdugo,
they
would
say
to
him,
you
don't
have
the
benefit
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
yet,
though
the
burden
is
on
them
to
justify
warrantless
searches,
they
have
presented
no
reason,
no
exigency
to
this
court
as
to
why
they
should
be
permitted
to
go
into
a
residence
without
a
warrant.
mr.
michael
pancer
no,
they
were
not.
mr.
michael
pancer
and
we
would
submit
those
arguments.
when
counsel
argued
previously,
for
the
first
time
we
were
able
to
determine
that
the
government
held
that
if
this
were
a
u.s.
citizen
in
custody,
then
the
fourth
amendment
would
apply
and
possibly
the
government
would
have
to
get
a
warrant.
but
many
cases
have
held
that
this
kind
of
discrimination
between
aliens
and
u.s.
citizens
is
inherently
suspect
and
clearly
in
this
case
there
would
be
no
reason
under
the
government's
reasoning
for
a
different
rule
as
to
aliens
versus
u.s.
citizens
whose
property
is
being
searched
outside
of
the
country.
in
addition,
there
is
no
rational
reason
why
the
fifth
amendment
or
the
due
process
clause
would
apply
as
opposed
to
the
fourth
amendment
in
these
situations,
and
the
government
has
presented
no
theory.
mr.
verdugo's
connection
to
this
country
was
that
he
was
forced
to
be
here.
he
was
arrested
and
forced
to
be
in
this
country.
he
has
been
tried
and
convicted
in
another
case
and
is
serving
240
years.
he
will
be
here
for
a
long
time.
he
has
as
strong
a
connection
to
this
country
and
did
at
the
time
of
the
search
as
any
united
states
citizen
had,
and
we
think
that
given
no
offer
by
the
government
as
to
why
the
warrant
requirement
shouldn't
apply,
where
is
the
exigency
that
allows
agents
to
just
go
into
a
person's
home,
that
this
court
should
find
a
warrant
was
required.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
