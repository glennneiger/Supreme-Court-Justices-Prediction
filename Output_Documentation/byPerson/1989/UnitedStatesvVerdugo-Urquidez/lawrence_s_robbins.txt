mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
overseas
search
of
a
foreign
national's
residence
conducted
by
american
agents
with
the
full
permission
and
participation--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--indeed
it
is.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
it's
extraterritorial.
it's
outside
the
united
states
and
perhaps
two
or
three
other
adjectives,
and
overseas
is
not
probably
one
of
them.
in
any
event,
the
search
was
conducted,
as
i
say,
with
the
full
permission
and
participation
of
the
host
country's
officials.
in
its
judgment
below,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
imposed
two
sweeping
constraints
on
such
extraterritorial
searches.
first,
the
court
held
that
respondent
was
entitled
to
invoke
the
protections
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
and,
second,
the
court
held
that
under
that
amendment
the
agents
were
required
to
secure
a
search
warrant
from
an
american
court
before
they
could
conduct
the
search
of
respondent's
premises.
that
broad,
potentially
far-reaching
and
in
our
view
mistaken
decision,
arises
from
a
not
uncommon
set
of
facts.
on
january
24th,
federal
marshals
took
respondent,
a
mexican
national,
into
custody
in
the
united
states
believing
that
his
two
houses
in
mexico
would
contain
evidence
of
narcotics
trafficking
as
well
as
his
complicity
in
the
assassination
of
a
federal
narcotics
agent.
dea
agents
made
arrangements
to
search
his
houses.
after
attempting
first,
without
success,
to
reach
the
second
deputy
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
mexico,
the
agents
contacted
the
director
general
of
the
mexican
federal
judicial
police,
thereafter
spoke
with
more
local
police
authorities,
and
from
those
persons
secured
permission
to
conduct
the
searches.
thereafter
the
agents,
together
with
members
of
the
mexican
police
force,
proceeded
to
respondent's
mexicali
and
san
felipe
residences.
once
there,
the
police
and
the
agents
conducted
the
searches.
at
the
direction
of
the
mexican
police
commander
who
substantially
dictated
the
scope,
duration,
and
the
actual
operation
of--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--as
far
as
we
know,
he
did,
your
honor.
the
record
reflects
that
before
giving
his
final
okay,
and
before
the
actual
search
took
place,
he
conferred
with
what
the
record
shows
is
in
mexico
called
a
delegado,
who
is
an
attorney
present
at
the
local
mfjp
station
house,
and
who
represents
the
attorney
general
of
the
republic
of
mexico
and
supervises
that--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no...
well,
our
submission,
justice
stevens,
of
course,--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no,
as--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
think
it's
possible
that
if
the
facts
were
very
different
from
the
ones
we
have
here,
it
could
be
that
asking
someone
who
obviously
has
no
authority
or
apparent
authority
would
present
a
different
case.
this
is
not
such
a
case.
i
can't--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--we
do
know
that
article
16
of
the
mexican
constitution
purports
to
require
a
warrant
under
certain
circumstances.
we've
indicated
in
our
reply
brief
in
response
to
an
argument
made
by
respondents
that
it
is
not
at
all
clear
whether
under
these
circumstances
a
warrant
would,
in
fact,
had
been
required
if
this
were
a
search
governed
by
mexican
constitutional
law.
we,
of
course...
it's
our
submission
that
mexican
constitutional
law
does
not
control
this
case
and,
in
any
event,
it's
our
view
that
for
all
appearances
sake,
the
mexican
officials
that
authorized
this
search
had
every
authority
that
they
were
conveying
to
the
american
agents
who
did
conduct
it.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
don't--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
there
was
permission--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
by
someone
who
it
was
reasonable
to
suppose...
reasonable
to
suppose...
had
the
authority
that
they
were
conveying
is
relevant
in
our
view
to
whether
the
search
was
reasonable,
if
you
assume
that
the
fourth
amendment
governs
that
search.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
we,
of
course,
make
no
such
assumption.
i
state
that
as
a
background
fact
because
it
bears
on
the
second
half
of
my
argument,
which
will
be
addressed
to
the
assumption
arguendo
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
apply.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
what
limits
our
ability
to
exercise
law
enforcement
jurisdiction
overseas
is
in
the
typical
case,
our
ability
to
secure
the
cooperation
of
the
host
country
which
is
sovereign
within
its
borders.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
our
position
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
control
the
analysis
of
that
question.
and
your
honor's
question
asks,
of
course,
about
a
regime
that's
not
presented
in
this
case,
in
which
we
have
no
cooperation,
in
which
in
fact
we
are
flouting
the
sovereign
jurisdiction
that
we're
entering
and
behaving,
i
gather,
with
a
form
of,
sort
of
random
violence.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
there
comes
a
point...
and
we've
indicated
that
there
is,
as
it
were,
a
safety
net
to
this
argument
provided
by
the
due
process
clause
which
operates
in
a
very
different
way
from
the
fourth
amendment.
that
is
to
say,
in
the
hypothetical
presented
by
justice
o'connor's
question,
if
the
agents
went
in
there
and
behaved
in
a
fashion
that
just
bespoke
utterly
no
limitations
at
all
as
it
were,
to
choose
a--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no,
it
doesn't.
and
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--because
it's
not
applying
abroad,
and
that's
one
of
the
important
differences.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no.
it
applies--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
take
it
that
the
shock
the
conscience
cases
are
talking
about
what
shocks
the
conscience
of
courts
that
are
asked
to
introduce
evidence.
and
so
that
the
due
process
clause
attaches
to
the
introduction
of
evidence
obtained
in
a
way
that
a
judge,
a
court,
a
reviewing
court
believes
to
shock
the
conscience.
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
operate
that
way.
the
admission
of
evidence
in
an
american
court
is
not
a
separate
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
fourth
amendment
violation
occurs,
if
it
occurs
at
all,
extraterritorially
and
the
separate
introduction
of
that
evidence
triggers
no
constitutional
question
at
all.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
impunity
may
make
a
greater
claim
that
we
wish
to
make
here.
the
fact
that
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
control
that
question
doesn't
mean,
for
example,
that
treaties
that
the
united
states
and
foreign
countries
have
entered
into
has
no
bearing.
it
does
not
mean
that
statues
passed
by
congress
such
as
22
u.s.c.
2291(c)
which
imposes
certain
limited
restrictions
on
law
enforcement
agents
bears
not
at
all.
it
simply
means
that
the
fourth
amendment
by
it
nature
and
in
this
context,
does
not
supply
the
substantive
restraints
on
that
activity.
and
yet
that
is
indeed
our
submission.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
the
answer
is
sometimes,
and
the
answer
is
it
depends.
and,
of
course,
it's
the
very
fact
that
it
depends--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
if
i
might,
justice
kennedy,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
that
directly
because
the
central
failing,
we
believe,
of
the
court
of
appeals,
is
that
they
thought
it
never
depends.
they
thought
that
the
constitution,
as
it
were,
provides
a
sort
of
universal
declaration
of
rights
of
man.
it
applies
whenever,
wherever
and
against
whomever
government
authority
acts.
and
we
don't
believe
that.
we
believe,
as
justice
harlan
suggested
in
his
separate
opinion
in
reid
against
covert
that
questions
of
extraterritoriality
are
ones
of
judgment
and
not
compulsion.
and
from
this
court's
cases,
we
isolate,
justice
kennedy,
three
factors
on
which
the
question
of
judgment
ultimately
turns.
the
first
of
these
is,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
right
that's
being
applied?
what
is
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
claim
that
the
person
seeks
the
benefit
of?
and
in
this
respect
it's
our
view
that
some
constitutional
rights
do
not
attach
to
all
persons
by
their
very
nature
and
do
not
apply
in
all
settings
by
their
very
nature.
and
i
think
the
fourth
amendment
in
some
ways
is
a
paradigm
case
of
a
constitutional
provision
that
makes
next
to
no
sense
in
most
overseas
settings.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
justice
white,
we
think
that
is
a
very
different
case
and
one--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
no.
i
think...
in
any
event,
what
i
meant
to
say
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
presents,
in
our
view,
a
constitutional
provision
whose
overseas
application
ought
to
be
by
its
very
nature
limited.
and
it
may
very
well
be,
and
we
would
not
contest
the
point
that
it
may
be
limited
to
citizens
or
persons
with
connections
to
the
united
states
close
to
citizenship.
and
i
base
that
on
a
couple
of
different
features
of
the
fourth
amendment
which
give
us
the
sense
that
it
was
not
intended,
as
it
were,
to
be
a
universal
declaration
of
rights.
we
start
with
the
text.
the
fourth
amendment
to
the
constitution
reserves
its
rights
to
a
class
of
persons
called
"the
people".
we
have
tried
to
indicate
in
our
brief
a
variety
of
reasons
why
we
firmly
believe
this
is
not
mere
happenstance.
it's
not
mere...
it's
not
words
that
were
chosen
haphazardly.
it
was
in
fact...
the
language
was
in
fact
chosen
precisely
to
confine
the
reach
of
the
protections
conferred.
like
the
preamble
to
the
constitution,
it
suggests
a
compact
relationship
between
the
claimants,
the
ones
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
that
right,
and--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
think,
for
that
matter,
justice
stevens,
there
were...
there
were
third
party
beneficiaries
to
the
preamble
as
well.
persons
who
were
not
the
ratifiers
are
clearly
entitled
to
the
benefits.
but
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
the
word...
it's
not
just
the
word
people,
it's
"the
people".
and
i
think
this
is
not
accidental.
let
me
suggest
two
reasons
why
i
think
so.
first
of
all,
if
you
go
back
and
take
a
look
at
what
the
contemporary
versions
of
the...
that
were
available
for
the
fourth
amendment
to
choose
from...
for
example,
your
honor's
dissenting
opinion
in
new
york
telephone
suggested
that
the
fourth
amendment
derives...
that
the
closest
precursor
was
the
massachusetts
bill
of
rights.
well,
the
massachusetts
bill
of
rights
was
phrased
"every
subject".
when...
when
richard
henry
lee,
for
example,
tried
to
append
a
bill
of
rights
to
the
constitution
before
it
was
submitted
to
the
ratifying
conventions,
he
phrased
it
as
"the
citizens".
when
patrick
henry,
in
the
ratification
convention
in
virginia
came
up
with
a
version
of
the
fourth
amendment,
he
limited
it
to
"every
freeman".
so,
there
was
a
sense,
i
think,
at
the
time
of
the
framing
of
the
fourth
amendment,
of
confining
the
scope
of
its
protections,
a
point
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
it's...
it's...
they
didn't
choose
any
of
those.
but
nor
did
they
choose
the
fifth
amendment's
"no
person".
nor
did
they
choose
the
sixth
amendment's,
the
"right
of
the
accused
in
all
criminal
cases.
"
and
what's
more--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
think,
at
a
minimum,
it
conveys
the
sense
that
the
court
of
appeals,
which
viewed
the
fourth
amendment
as
a
universal
declaration
of
rights,
was
considerably
off
base.
the
last
point
i
want
to
make
and
then
i'll
move
to
the
other
two
factors,
justice
kennedy,
that
i
think
inform
the
analysis
is...
it's
worth
comparing
the
other
provisions
in
the
bill
of
rights
that
also
use
the
phrase
"the
people"
because
they
cannot
be
understood
unless
you
recognize
that
"the
people"
was
a
limiting
concept.
the
other
provisions
that
use
that
phrase
are
the
ninth
and
tenth
amendments
which
make
utterly
no
sense
except
in
terms
of
this
compact
that
i'm
describing;
the
second
amendment,
which
refers
to
the
right
to
bear
arms,
which
can't
plausibly
be
assumed
to
be
a
right
of
persons
overseas
to
have
arms;
and
finally,
a
portion
of
the
first
amendment
which
speaks
of
the
right
to
peaceably
assemble
and
petition
the
government.
again,
the
notion
that
one
comes
back
to
is
the
sense
of
a
compact
relationship
with
the
government
that
receives
some
of
the
power
but
in
which
the
people
reserve
the
balance
that
is
not
extended.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
sure
that
it
does.
but,
justice
kennedy,
let
me
hasten
to
add
that
i
do
not
rely
on...
i
don't
know
if
i
would
call
it
semantics...
but
at
least
purely
a
textual
argument
because
i
believe
that
the
purpose
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
one
that
makes
it
awfully
difficult
to
suppose
it
was
intended
to
provide
rights
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe.
after
all,
the
fourth
amendment,
as
this
court
and
every
other
court
has
said
more
than
once,
is
designed
to
protect
expectations
of
privacy.
and
that
concept,
i
suggest,
is
unusually
sensitive
to
local
tradition
and
culture.
it's
difficult
for
courts
to
adjudicate.
and
what's
more,
it
seems
to
us
that
adjudication
of
what
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
an
american
court
in
a
contested
criminal
litigation
or
any
other
kind
is
perhaps
unseemly,
perhaps
even
improper,
raising,
i
suppose,
even
act
of
state
doctrine
questions.
now,
that's
just
the
first
inquiry.
what
is
the
nature
of
the
right?
but
from
this
court's
cases,
we
think
that
there
are
two
other
factors
that
again
move
us
away
from
this
universalist
view
taken
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
second
is
what
is
the
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
the
place
in
which
the
constitutional
claim
arises?
the
fact
that
the
search
or
seizure
takes
place
in
a
foreign
country,
in
a
separate
sovereignty,
makes
the
case,
i
think,
for
overseas
application
of
a
constitutional
right
a
very
difficult
one
to
win
on.
and
that's
true
for
any
number
of
reasons.
the
fact
that
this
is
a
separate
sovereignty,
mexico,
indicates
that
it's
their
laws
and
not
ours
that
ought
to
presumptively
control
disputes.
our
constitution,
by
its
nature,
does
not
seem
designed
to
have
widespread
overseas
application.
the
preamble
which
justice
stevens
adverted
to
before
uses
language
that
just
doesn't
sound
like
it
was
written
for
mexico,
france,
the
netherlands,
and
the
rest
of
the
world.
and
finally,--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
think
if
what
your
honor
is
saying
is
that
we
can
build
into
the
reasonableness
investigation
the
context,
the
fact
that
this
is
an
overseas
search,
i
couldn't
agree
more.
i
think
that's
yet
a
separate
and
entirely
independent
fallacy
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
you
can.
i
guess
our
view
is
that
that
feature
of
the
fourth
amendment
makes
it
seem
inapplicable
overseas.
but
we
freely
concede
it
also
bears
on
how
you
would
analyze
it
should
you
conclude
that
it
does
apply
overseas.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
these
defects,
the
inapplicability
and
the
inappropriateness
of
applying
the
doctrine,
weigh
in
both
at
the
threshold...
does
it
apply
+/?
and
at
what
justice
o'connor
referred
to
as
our
fallback
position...
how
does
it
apply?
finally,
the
last
factor
that
we
think
is
relevant
is
what
is
the
relationship
of
the
claimant
to
the
united
states?
this
is
a
familiar
inquiry,
one
raised
in
johnson
against
eisentrager,
more
recently
in
landon
against
plasencia
and
the
basic
notion
is
that,
"aliens
are
accorded
a
generous
and
ascending
scale
of
rights
as
he
increases
his
identity
with
our
society.
"
this
is
a
point
that
comes
up
in
a
great
many
of
the
immigration
cases.
and
the
notion
is,
again,
the
closer
the
connection
to
the
united
states
of
citizenship
or
naturalization
or
permanent
residence,
the
greater
the
claim
for
the
protections
of
the
social
compact.
now,
viewing
these
three
factors
as
a
whole
in
this
case
i
suggest
that
the
solution
is
not
difficult
to
find
because
respondent
is
at
the
wrong
end
of
each
of
the
three
spectrums
that
i've
suggested.
the
fourth
amendment,
first
of
all,
is,
we
think,
peculiarly
out
of
place
in
an
overseas
context
and
peculiarly
unwarranted
for
overseas
application.
second,
this
is
a
completely
separate
sovereignty.
mexico
is
independent
of
the
united
states.
it's
a
wholly
extraterritorial
search
unlike,
say,
searches
on
the
high
seas
or
in
the
customs
waters
or
in
territories
in
which
the
united
states
exercises
substantial
sovereignty.
and,
finally,
this
is
a
claimant
with
little
or
no
ongoing
connection
to
the
united
states,
little
or
no
membership,
if
any,
in
the
united
states
community.
those
factors,
we
think,
taken
as
a
whole,
confirm
our
view
that
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
and
its
result
in
this
case
was
wrong...
that
the
fourth
amendment
simply
doesn't
apply.
now,
let
me
hasten
to
add...
i
mentioned
this...
i
adverted
to
it
before,
i
believe,
justice
stevens,
in
answer
to
one
of
your
questions.
the
fact
that
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
provide
the
controlling
restraints
on
conduct
does
not
mean
that
all
foreign
nationals
are
out
of
luck
when
there
is
some
kind
of
activity
of
american
agents
that
is
thought
to
be
out
of
bounds.
congress
has,
and
has
in
fact
exercised
the
power
to
impose
restraints
on
agents.
i
referred
before
to
22
u.s.c.
2291(c)
which
restricts
law
enforcement
officers
in
u.s.
persons
abroad.
as
i
said
before,
also
there
can
be
treaties
that
restrain
the
exercise
of
american
power
overseas
and
i
suppose
as
a
fallback
position
as
well
the
due
process
clause,
which
again
regulates
the
admission
of
evidence
internally...
a
domestic
restraint...
may
also
exercise
a
protection
of
last
resort.
but
even
if
the
fourth
amendment
generally
applies,
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
for
that
matter,
justice
stevens,
if
the
indictment
is
correct,
he's
also
had...
he's
made
periodic
trips
here
for
narcotics
trafficking;
he's
sent
shipments
of
marijuana
to
the
united
states.
he
may
well,
for
all
we
know,
have
cash
saved
in
bank
accounts
in
the
united
states.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
is
undoubtedly
the
case
that
had
he
never
been
here
our
argument
would
be
that
much
stronger.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
but
his
presence
as
an
involuntary
criminal
defendant
is
not
the
kind
of
presence
that
johnson
against--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--it's
not
johnson
against
eisentrager
presence.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no
question
about
it.
but
those
are
domestic
rights,
rights
that
apply
in
the
united
states
at
trial
or
prior
to
trial.
they
are
not
restraints
on
the
overseas
application
of
american
power.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
but
it...
but,
again,
the
fourth
amendment
is
not--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--separately
violated
in
the
united
states.
it
is,
again,
an
extraterritorial
application.
let
me
quickly
address
the
warrant
clause
issue
because
it's
our
submission
that
even
if
the
fourth
amendment
applies,
surely
the
warrant
clause
does
not.
the
court
of
appeals
reasoned
that
to
relieve
the
government
of
the
warrant
requirement...
quote...
would
be
to
treat
foreign
searches
differently
from
domestic
searches
just
because
they
are
foreign.
but,
of
course,
foreign
searches
are
different,
and
that's
just
the
point.
they
call
for
different
treatment
under
the
fourth
amendment.
there
are
in
this
setting
special
needs
beyond
the
normal
need
for
law
enforcement,
and
a
warrant
requirement
is
therefore
inappropriate,
and
i
say
that
for
two
reasons.
first,
as
this
court
suggested
in
its
skinner
decision,
a
warrant
would
do
little
to
further
the
aims
of
the
warrant
clause.
it
would
not
empower
the
agents
to
go
forward.
it
would
give
them
no
authority
in
mexico,
or,
to
use
the
court
of
appeals',
i
think,
elegant
characterization,
it
would
be
a
dead
letter
in
mexico.
it
would
not
provide
meaningful
protection
on
the
scope
of
the
search.
and
this
case
indicates
just
why
that's
so.
because
the
actual
operation
is
apt
to
be
in
the
control
of
the
host
country's
officials.
and
just
as
the
mexican
commander
ordered
the
agents
to
gather
up
the
remaining
documents
and
look
at
them
later,
so
too
can
it
not
be
expected
that
a
warrant
would
have
that
confining
force.
apart
from
the
fact
that
a
warrant
could
not
fulfill
its
traditional
missions,
in
this
setting
the
burden
of
obtaining
a
warrant
is
likely
to
frustrate
the
governmental
purpose
behind
this
search.
there
is
no
u.s.
magistrate
who
is
authorized
to
issue
one.
we've
still
not
been
told
by
anybody
who
the
agents
were
supposed
to
go
to
see
in
order
to
get
this
warrant
that
they
were
supposedly
supposed
to
execute.
a
warrant
would
certainly
interfere
with
their
ability
to
do
their
job
which
requires
them
to
obey
the
restrictions
imposed
by
the
host
officials
and
not
follow
the
competing
agenda
set
by
the
united
states
magistrate.
in
this
case
we
believe
the
proper
approach
is
one
of
reasonableness,
the
basic
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
here
the
agents'
behavior
was
evidently
reasonable.
they
sought
approval
at
the
highest
levels
of
the
mexican
government
available.
they
secured
that
approval.
they
participated
with
the
mexicans
in
the
conduct
of
the
search,
and
they
obeyed
the
dictates
imposed
by
the
host
during
the
search.
we
believe,
in
short,
that
questions
of
extraterritoriality
are
not
on/off
switches,
as
the
court
of
appeals
supposed.
there
is
and
must
be
considerable
room
for
judgment.
it
this
a
territory
in
which
constitutional
protections
makes
sense?
is
this
claimant
within
the
constitutional
zone
of
interest?
do
the
rights
asserted
lend
themselves
to
overseas
application
and
even
if
a
right
applies,
must
it
apply
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
it
does
domestically?
these
are
complicated
questions
to
be
sure,
but
the
court
of
appeals
never
asked
them.
it
believed,
instead,
that
the
constitution
applies
everywhere,
to
everyone,
regardless
of
circumstance.
had
the
court
of
appeals
asked
the
right
questions,
it
would
not
have
suppressed
the
tally
sheets
in
this
case.
this
judgment
should
be
reversed.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
very
briefly.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
on
the
assumption
for
now
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
apply,
let
me
just
say
a
couple
of
words
about
reasonableness.
the
first
thing
i
want
to
say
about
that
is
that
it
does
not
turn
on
whether
the
agents
have
complied
with
article
16
of
the
mexican
constitution.
i
have
tried
myself
to
read
article
16
of
the
mexican
constitution
several
times.
i've
quoted
it
at
pages
11
and
12
of
our
reply
brief
in
footnote
10
and
our
office
has
not
been
able
to
get
a
definitive
sense
of
whether
it
applies
here.
it
is
very
different
from
the
warrant
clause
of
the
united
states
constitution.
it
does
not,
for
example,
require
probable
cause.
it
has,
for
example,
an
exception
for
searches
for
sanitary...
to
enforce
the
sanitary
and
police
regulations,
which
under
mexican
law,
as
we
understand
it,
includes
the
narcotics
laws.
the
fact
is,
it's
a
different
constitutional
provision
and
what
that
really
tells
you
is
not
so
much
does
it
apply
or
doesn't
it
apply.
but
it's
simply
not
plausible
to
suppose
that
agents
executing
law
enforcement
activities
overseas
should
be
conversant
with
the
niceties
of
constitutional
law
of
150
different
countries.
what
counts
is
whether
their
activities,
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
in
one
of
his
questions,
are
objectively
reasonable.
and
under
any
test,
the
activities
of
these
agents
was.
they
sought
out
approval
at
the
highest
levels
of
the
government.
they
secured
approval.
let
me
just
quickly
say
that
these
allegations
of
corruption
are
based
on,
for
the
most
part,
questions
that
didn't
elicit
the
answers
that
counsel...
defense
counsel
had
hoped
at
the
suppression
hearing,
and
in
any
event
are
not
the
subject
of
any
finding
in
the
lower
courts.
they
secured
the
authorization.
they
secured
the
cooperation
and
the
participation,
and
they
followed
the
dictates
that
were
imposed.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i'm
sorry?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
not
one
of
the
american
officers.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
but
what
that
points
out,
among
other
things,
is
the...
i
think
the
zaniness
of
seeking
a
search
warrant.
i
mean,
the
purpose
of
the
search
warrant
is
supposed
to
confine
the
scope
of
the
search.
you
cannot
in
the
host
country
tell
the
host
country's
officials
how
to
behave.
you're
there
at
their
sufferance.
and
it's
precisely
that
kind
of
example
that
tells
you
how
far
off
base
the
court
of
appeals
was.
