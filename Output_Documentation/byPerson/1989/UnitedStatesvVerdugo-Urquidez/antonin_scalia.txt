justice
antonin
scalia
--exaggerate
in
your
first
statement,
your
first
sentence,
for
pete's
sake.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
fair.
that's
on
your
own
assumption.
that
is
on
your
own
assumption.
that
you
didn't
really
need
the
permission
of
the
mexican
authorities.
i
think
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question
has
to
be
yes,
that
if
these
people
are
living
in
a
regime
that
lets
people
break
into
their
houses
and
do
anything
they
want,
we
should
benefit
from
that
regime
as
well
as
anybody
else.
isn't
that
your...
isn't
that
essentially
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
the
due
process
clause
apply
abroad
and
not
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
shocks
the
conscience
unless
it's
the
breaking
into
the
house
abroad?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
as
long
as
you
had
such
a
break-in
for
intelligence
purposes
only
and
never
tried
to
prosecute
the
individual,
then
at
least
in
that
situation
you
could...
you
could
do
it
with
impunity?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
couldn't
have
used
"every
subject",
or
they
wouldn't
have
been
likely
to
use
"every
subject",
would
they?
in
fact,
"the
people"
is
probably
the
best
equivalent
in
democratic
terms
of
every
subject.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
all
true,
but
all
it
takes
to
accommodate
that
is
to
say
that
unreasonable...
i
mean,
the
only
governing
word
it
has
is
"unreasonable".
everything
is
okay
if
it's
reasonable,
right?
and
all
you
have
to
say
is
that
it's
not
unreasonable
if
it
complies
with
local
law,
wherever
that
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
would
mean
everything
would
be
just
the
way
you
would
like
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
also
eliminates
the
argument
you
just
made
that
if
we
acknowledge
that
the
fourth
amendment
applies
abroad,
we're
letting
ourselves
into
a
lot
of
silly
results.
that
obviously
you
have
to
take
foreign
manners
and
customs
into
effect.
i'm
saying
you
can
read
the
fourth
amendment
to
apply
abroad
and
still
take
them
into
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
do
you
think
they
should
have
gotten
that
warrant
from,
in
particular?
justice
antonin
scalia
puerto
rico?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
as
good
as
any.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
the
mexican
authorities
would
be
a
little
bit
annoyed
with
an
american
official
issuing
a
document
that
authorizes
an
american
law
enforcement
officer
to
search
their
territory?
you
don't
think
that
mexico
might
be
annoyed
at
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
an
unusual
warrant
then,
isn't
it?
because,
i
mean,
a
normal
warrant
is
something
that
is
presented
to
the
person
in
control
of
the
premises
which
shows
the
legal
authority.
and
the
person,
if
he
resists
the
execution
of
that
warrant,
is
subject
to
punishment.
so
you're
talking
about
a
very...
i
mean,
you
could
call
it
a
warrant
if
you
like.
but
it's...
it's
a
strange
form
of
warrant,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
may
be
but
it's
not
a
warrant
as
we
have
generally
known
warrants,
what
you're
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
cases
that
say
they
have
authority
to
issue
it
beyond
their
jurisdiction?
that
in
that
particular
respect
they
can
exceed
what
the
rule
says?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
there's
a...
do
you
have
to
consult
with
a
certain
number
of
people
before
the
search
can
be
reasonable?
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
he
contacted
the
supervisor
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
know
if
his
supervisors
were
smarter
than
he
was.
maybe,
you
know,
he
may
have
been
smarter
than
his
supervisors,
in
which
case
the
consulting
would
be
counterproductive.
we
just
don't
have
any
such
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
when
you
say
it's
a
fourth
amendment
it
doesn't...
you
know,
it
can
no
longer
be
controlled
by
congress.
it's
an
absolute.
suppose
the
drug
problem
is
so
severe
that
with
the
full
authorization
of
congress
the
executive
sends
a
battalion
of
troops
to
a
foreign
country
that
has
been
absolutely
uncooperative
in
our
efforts
to
prevent
the
exportation
of
drugs
to
this
country?
it's
not
a
war.
just
sends
a
battalion
and
the
object
is
to
search
and
destroy
any
heroin
production
facilities.
and
they
have
authority
to
go
and
search
and
destroy.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
no,
but
wait.
they
shouldn't
be
doing
it
at
all.
i
mean,
i'm
advising
the
president...
i'm
counsel
to
the
president.
he
says,
you
know,
congress
has
passed
this
statute,
i
think
we
should
do
it.
but
if
you
tell
me
it's
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
i
don't
care
whether
i'm
introducing
evidence
or
not.
i
certainly
shouldn't
do
it
if
it
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so
it
can't
be
done
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
absolutely.
there's
no
way,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
court
do
they
seek
a
warrant
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
having
no
prisoner
back
in
any
particular
jurisdiction,
who
should
they
call?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
called
warrant
central.
[laughter]
