chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-1353,
united
states
v.
rene
martin
verdugo-orquidez.
mr.
robbins,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
overseas
is
a
little
strong
for
mexicali,
isn't
it?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
robbins.
mr.
pancer,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
ninth
circuit
was
mindful
of
that
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
the
defendant's
presence
in
the
southern
district...
you
don't
give
notice
to
him
of
a
motion
to
file
a
search
warrant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
he
did
not
seek
to
vindicate
the
rights
you
say
were
denied
under
mexican
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
he
seek
to
sue
the
mexican
agents
whom
you
say
violated
his
rights?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
traditional
rule...
an
objective
test...
you
know,
if
you're
right
objectively,
i
thought
it
didn't
make
any
difference
how
many
people
you
consulted.
and
if
you're
wrong
objectively,
consulting
a
number
of
people
beforehand
shouldn't
validate
the
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
failure
to
consult
adds
nothing
to
the
objective.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
the
term
corrupt
mean
when
you
use
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
a
policeman
serves
a
warrant...
can
the
defendant
defend
against
the
search
and
claim
it's
illegal
on
the
grounds
that
the
policeman
had
taken
a
bribe
in
an
unrelated
situation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was
it
suggested
that
the
american
agents
who
participated
in
this
particular
search
in
mexico
had
themselves
tried
to
bribe
this
agent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
a
lot
different
than
being
very
directly
tied
into
this
particular
search.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
the
fourth
amendment
applied
to
american
forces
in
mexico
during
the
mexican
war?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
didn't
apply
in
those
situations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
don't
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
constitution
or
the
bill
of
rights
applies
equally
everywhere
in
the
world
that
the
united
states
is
acting?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
if
a
plaintiff
brings
a
suit
under
1983...
the
same
hypothesis
as
justice
kennedy's.
no
evidence
was
introduced
to
him
but
he's
been
the
victim
of
a
seizure
of
property
that
he
says
violates
the
fourth
amendment
because,
as
you
say,
the
fourth
amendment
applies
in
that
situation.
how
does
the
court
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pancer.
mr.
robbins,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
robbins.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases.
the
first
is
united
states
versus
verdugo-urquidez.
here,
the
respondent,
rene
martin
verdugo-urquidez,
was
a
mexican
citizen
and
resident
whom
the
drug
enforcement
agency
believed
to
be
a
leader
of
an
organization
that
smuggles
narcotics
into
this
country.
the
mexican
police
officers
apprehended
him
in
mexico
and
transported
him
to
the
united
states
boarder
where
he
was
arrested
by
united
states
marshals.
shortly
afterwards,
dea
agents
working
in
concert
with
mexican
police
searched
his
residence
in
mexico
and
seized
certain
documents.
the
district
court
granted
his
motion
to
suppress
evidence
seized
during
the
searches
concluding
that
the
fourth
amendment
applied
to
the
searches
and
that
the
dea
agents
failed
to
justify
searching
respondentâ€™s
premisses
without
a
warrant,
and
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
this
view.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
to
the
search
and
seizure
by
united
states
agents
of
property
owned
by
a
non-resident
alien
and
located
in
a
foreign
country.
the
text
of
the
fourth
amendment,
its
history,
and
our
cases
interpreting
the
provision
indicate
that
the
fourth
amendment
was
not
intended
to
apply
in
this
situation.
the
respondent
is
an
alien
with
no
previous
voluntary
connection
with
this
country,
it
is
legal
but
involuntary
presence
here
does
not
indicate
any
such
connection.
any
restrictions
on
searches
and
seizures
incident
to
american
action
abroad
must
be
imposed
by
the
political
branches
through
diplomatic
understanding,
treaty,
or
legislation.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed.
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
joins;
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
