mr.
tunheim,
i...
i
had
assumed
that
the
purpose
of
this
provision...
i
mean,
maybe...
maybe
you
will
tell
me
otherwise,
but
i
had
assumed
that
its
purpose
was
not
just
to...
to
assist
the
child,
but
that
the
legislature
also
thought
that
apart
from
whether
it
would
do
the
child
good
or
not,
the
biological
parents
were
presumed
to
have
the
right
to
provide
advice
on
this
matter
if
they...
if
they
wanted
to
to
the
child.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
there...
there...
there's
a...
there's
a
parental
interest
involved
as
well
as
a...
as
a
filial
interest,
isn't
that
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
saying
what
i'm
saying...
oh,
oh,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it
death
within
three
days?
i
suppose
that's
the
amount
of
time
that
they
think
the
notification
will
take?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
doesn't
seem
so
absurd,
then.
i
mean,
if...
if
you
don't...
you
don't
need
the
exception,
if...
if
though
your
life
may
be
at
risk,
it's...
it's
not
going
to
be
at
risk
by
the
notification.
