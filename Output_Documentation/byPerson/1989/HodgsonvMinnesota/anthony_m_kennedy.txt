how...
how
do
you
define
the
privacy
interest
that
the
child
has
here
in
her
nontraditional
family,
say,
with
the
stepfather
and...
and...
and
a
natural
mother
apart
from
any
interest
she
has
in
medical
treatment?
what
is
her
privacy
interest
that
you're
protecting
here,
and
what
are
the
cases
that
you
rely
on?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
quite...
quite
apart
from
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--because
you
began
by
saying
that...
that
this
interferes
with
the
ongoing
family
relation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
my...
my
question
is
what
is
the
definition
of
the
privacy
interest
that
you're
asserting
here?
is
it
an
interest
to
live
in
a...
a
home
without...
without
disruption?
is
that
how
you
phrase
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
can
you
be
more
specific
than
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
quite
apart
from
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
quite
apart
from
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
a
commerce
clause
context
in
which
we
were
not
depriving
the
state
of
the
authority
to
legislate.
we
were
just
saying
that
the
state
or
the
national
government
could...
could
regulate.
so
i...
it
seems
to
me
that's
inapt.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
mandatory
that
the
authorities
notify
both
biological
parents
of
the
abuse?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
minor
is
often
the
only
source?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
those
exceptions
are
constitutionally
required?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
in
your
view,
the
state
can
require
notification
to
a
parent
who
has
been
declared
unfit
and
who
has
been
denied
the
custody
of
the
minor
by
reason
of
the
parent
having
sexually
abused
the
minor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i'm
saying
that
custody
has
been
taken
away
from
the
parent
because
the
parent
is
unfit
and
has
sexually
abused
the
minor,
and
i'm
asking
you
whether
or
not
your
position
is
that
the
state
has
the
constitutional
right
to
require
the
minor
to
notify
that
parent
in
all
circumstances?
