ms.
benshoof,
you
appear
to
be
arguing
in
the
brief
that
applying
a
compelling
interest
standard
would
result
in
striking
the
two-parent
requirement.
what
result
would
you
reach
under
a
rationality
standard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
tunheim,
the
statute
with
its
absolute
two-parent
notice
requirement
does
sweep
broadly
and
pick
up
some
cases,
does
it
not,
where
a
parent
would
have
to
be
notified
even
though
possibly
that
parent
had
been
denied
custody
of
the
child
because
the
court
had
found
that
it
was
not
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child?
i
mean,
are
there
a
high
percentage
of...
of
children
in
minnesota
living
with
a
divorced...
in
a
divorced
family?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
put
the
other
way,
50
percent
do
not.
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
to
get
right
to
the
heart
of
it,
the
statute
just
doesn't
provide
for
any
exceptions
on
the
notice,
even
though
clearly
there
are
some
circumstances
where
it
would
not
be
in
the
best
interests
of
the
child
to
notify
one
of
the
two
parents.
how
do
you--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--how
do
you
defend
the
state's
interest
as
to
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
might
be
true
in
general,
but
probably
you
would
concede
that
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
it
would
not
be
in
the
best
interests
of
a
child
to
tell
one
of
the
two
parents
of
her
problem
and
intention.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet
there
is
no
mechanism
provided
at
all
whereby
the
best
interests
of
the
child
can
be
considered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
has
to
be
reported
to
a
state
agency
that
then,
in
turn,
notifies
the
parents,
is
that
right?
