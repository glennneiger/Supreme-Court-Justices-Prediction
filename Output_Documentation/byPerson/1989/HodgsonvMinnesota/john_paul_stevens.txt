justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
stop
you
there
with
one
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
going
back
to
your
dialogue
with
justice
scalia
earlier,
just
focusing
simply
on
the
parental
interest
in
knowing
what's
happening
to
the
child
as
one
of
the
justifications
for
the
two-parent
requirement,
does
minnesota
vindicate
that
interest
in
any
other
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
minnesota
as
compared
to
ohio,
in
the
area
of
drug
treatment,
sexually
transmitted
diseases
and
things
of
that
character?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
what
about...
do
they
also
require
that
the
parents
be
notified,
to
vindicate
this
interest
in
keeping
the
parents
informed
about
what
happens
to
the
children?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
sexually
transmitted
disease
area
and
in
the
drug
treatment
area.
really,
in
any
area
other
than
name
change.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
a
concern
that
the
parents
might
object
to
the
treatment,
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't...
isn't
it
true
that
the
district
court
did
say
that
although
that's
a...
that's
a
legitimate
purpose
and
a...
and
a...
a
worthwhile
goal,
that
in
some
situations
this
statute
actually
disserves
that
goal
because
there
will
be
cases
in
which
the
minor
is
willing
to
tell
one
parent
if
that's
going
to
be
the
end
of
the
situation,
but
not
to
tell
both.
and
the
requirement
of
telling
both
will
cause
the
child
not
to
tell
either,
and
therefore,
that
in
some
situations,
the
statute
is
counterproductive,
and
that
the
state
didn't
sustain
the
burden
of
overcoming
that...
proof
to
that
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
she
doesn't
want
to
go
through
the
bypass
procedure.
she's
willing
to
tell
one
parent,
provided
that
that's
the
end
of
the
matter.
but
if
telling
one
parent
will
merely
require
her
to
go
to
court
anyway,
perhaps
she'd
tell...
tell
neither.
i
think
that's
the
thrust
of
the
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
what
is...
what
does
the
statute
provide
with
respect
to
the
identity
of
the
person
who
must
give
the
notice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
required
to
be
in-person
or
by
telephone
or
can
it
be
written
notice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
if
the...
if
the
pregnant
minor
makes
an
appointment
at
the
same
time
the
clinic
could
send
a
notice
out
while
the
appointment
is
being
scheduled,
so
you...
you
in
effect
don't
waste...
don't
have
two
successive
time
periods
involved?
