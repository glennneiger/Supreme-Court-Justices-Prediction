harry
a.
blackmun
general
tunheim,
does
any
other
state
have
the
two-parent
notification?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
your
answer
is
no?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
your
answer
is
no,
then?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
does
minnesota
have
a
two-parent
requirement
with
respect
to
any
other
medical
procedure
whatsoever?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
your
answer
is
no
again,
after
all
those
words?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
isn't...
isn't
that
true
in
almost
every
other
state?
we
have
rural
areas
in...
even
in
virginia
and
maryland.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
your
opponent
said
the
emergency
was
confined
to
the
possible
death
of
the
mother.
is
that
true?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
so
there's
nothing
there
as
to
the
health
of
the
mother?
