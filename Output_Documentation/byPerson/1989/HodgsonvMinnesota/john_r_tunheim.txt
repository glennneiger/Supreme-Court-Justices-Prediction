mr.
john
r.
tunheim
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
primary
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
state
can
require
a
reasonably
diligent
effort
to
notify
the
parents
of
an
unemancipated
minor
48
hours
prior
to
the
performance
of
an
abortion.
also
before
the
court
is
the
question
of
whether
the
substitute
version
of
the
law,
in
effect
for
over
five
years
with
the
court
bypass,
is
constitutional.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
the...
the
law
provides,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
parental
notification
is
required
in
all
cases
48
hours
prior
to
performance
of
an
abortion.
but
in
the...
in
the
event
that
that
provision
is
even
enjoined
by
a
court,
then
the
substitute
provision
of
the
law
would
go
into
effect
which
provides
a
judicial
bypass
alternative.
now,
decisions
of
this
court
in
five
cases
involving
laws
construing
parental
involvement
in
minors'
abortions
have
established
two
clear
principles...
that
for
immature
and
non-best
interest
minors,
states
may
require
parental
notice
and
even
consent.
for
mature
and
best
interest
minors,
states
may
condition
abortions
on
parental
consent
or
judicial
approval.
now,
with
respect
to
minnesota
law,
certainly
the
minnesota
notice
bypass
law
is
constitutional
if
the
court
finds
that
the
bypass
adheres
to
the
bellotti
standards,
and
certainly
the
notice
law
is
constitutional
as
applied
to
immature
and
non-best
interest
minors.
unresolved
is
the
issue
whether
the
notice
law
is
constitutional
as
to
minors
who
claim
to
be
mature
or
who
claim
that
their
best
interests
are
served
by
having
an
abortion
without
parental
notification.
now,
although
i
intend
to
direct
my
argument
to
the
notice
law,
i'd
like
to
address
briefly
several
of
petitioners'
claims.
the
petitioners
are
asking
this
court
to
overturn
decisions
in
matheson,
bellotti
ii
and
ashcroft.
they're
asking
this
court
to
significantly
limit
parents'
rights
and
responsibilities
by
finding
that
minors
have
constitutional
privacy
rights
as
against
their
parents
and
a
right
to
withhold
important
information
from
parents.
petitioners
in
effect
are
asking
this
court
to
second-guess
a
state
legislature
that
has
made
a
reasonable
value
judgment
that
it
is
beneficial
for
parents
to
know
when
minor
daughters
are
pregnant
and
seeking
an
abortion,
that
parents
can
in
effect
be
very
helpful
to
minors
during
a
time
of
serious
trauma.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
your
honor,
the
evidence
in
the
case
shows
that
approximately
50
percent
of
minors
in
minnesota
live
with
both
biological
parents.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
that's
correct,
but
that...
that
50
percent
doesn't
include
minors
who
live
in
families
in
which
they've
been
adopted
or
there
have
been
other
circumstances.
with
respect
to--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--your
honor,
the
statute--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--your
honor,
the
statute
does
not
require
notification
of...
to
a
parent
whose
rights
have
been
terminated,
termination
of
parental
rights;
does
not
require
notification
to
a
parent
or
a
father
who
has
not
been
adjudicated
as
a...
as
a
parent.
it
does
require
notification
to
a
non-custodial
parent,
and
i
submit
that
there's
no
evidence
in
this
record
or
no
reason
for
the
belief
that
a
non-custodial
parent
is
no
longer
fit
to
assist
a
minor
during
a
difficult
time
in
her
life.
a
custodial
proceeding
does
not
determine
that
a
parent
is
not
fit
to...
to
be
a
parent.
it's
still...
that
person
is
still
a
parent
with
significant
rights
and
responsibilities,
and
there's
no
reason
for
a
presumption
that
that
parent
would
not
act
in
the
best
interests
of
the
minor
if
notified.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
there
certainly...
there
are
interests
involved
in
which
the
state
is
concerned
for
the
best
interest
of
the
minor
and
has
found
that
parents
are
best
able
to
help
minors
in...
in
a
very
difficult
and
traumatic
time,
but
there's
also--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--there
is
also
the
separate
and
distinct
interest
that
parents
have
in...
in
actually
knowledge
about
important
events
in...
in
minors'
lives.
both
parents
have
those
rights
and
responsibilities.
it's
a
protected
liberty
interest,
as
this
court
has
found
in
a...
in
a
long
series
of
cases.
it's
a
significant
state
interest
in
preserving
parents'
traditional
responsibilities
for
the
nurturing
and
upbringing
of
minor
children,
and
it's
based
upon
the
concept
that
minors
are
peculiarly
vulnerable
and
that
parents
in
most
cases
act
in
the
best
interests
of
their
minor
children.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
certainly,
your
honor,
and
i
submit
to
the
court--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
a
legislature
has
made
determinations
that
are
within
the
law
itself
as
to
those
minors
whose
best
interests
may
not
lie
in
notifying
their
parents
of
having
a
desire
to
seek
an
abortion.
there
is
an
abuse
exception
in
this
law
that
is
extensive.
if
a
minor
simply
declares
that
she
is
a
victim
of
sexual
abuse--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--what
the
law
requires
is
simply
that,
in
order
to
avoid
notification,
a
minor
declare
that
she
is
a
victim
of
sexual
abuse
or
physical
abuse
or
neglect.
if
that
abuse
has
occurred
within
the
previous
three
years,
there
is
a
provision
which
requires,
under
a
separate
law
in
minnesota,
the
reporting
of
the
child
abuse
to
child
protection
authorities,
but
there
is
no
assurance,
as
counsel
for
the
petitioners
has
stated,
that
the
parents
are
going
to
find
out
in
that
instance.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
justice
kennedy,
i
do
not
believe
that
they
are
constitutionally
required.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
your
honor,
if
you're
talking
about
a
parent
whose
rights
have
been
terminated
as
a
parent,
a
finding
that
they
are
unfit,
then
that's
a
different
story.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
your
honor,
i
think
a
state
has
the
constitutional
right
to
do
that,
but
it
is
not
mandated
under
the
minnesota
law
in
any
stretch
of
the
imagination.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
there
are,
i
think,
11
or
12
parental
notification
statutes
that
have
been
enacted
around
the
country
and
i'm
not
aware
of
another
one
that
has
a
two-parent
notification
requirement,
but
i
could
be
wrong
about
that.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
i'm
not
aware
of
another
one
that
does.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
yes.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
the
general
rule
in
minnesota
for
minor
treatment
medical
procedures
is
that
there
is
no
autonomy
on
the
part
of
the
minor
to
make
those
decisions
by
himself
or
herself.
it's
a
one-parent
consent
requirement
that
is
the
general
rule
under
minnesota
law.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
justice
blackmun,
my
answer
is
no,
but
i
submit
that
a
notification
requirement
is
not
the
equivalent
of
a
consent
requirement,
and,
in
fact,
let
me
address
that
issue.
that's
a
pivotal
distinction
in
this
case,
that
notice
is
not
the
equivalent
of
consent,
either
factually
or
at
law.
factually,
i
think
it's
helpful
to
analyze
the
issue
from
the
standpoint
of
control.
a
consent
requirement
transfers
ultimate
control
over
the
decision
to
the
parent.
despite
a
minor's
best
wishes,
no
abortion
is
performed
until
the
form
is
signed
by
the
parent.
it
grants
a
veto
power
to
a
parent,
and
a
parent
can
exercise
that
veto
power
passively
by
simply
ignoring
a
minor's
request
to
even
discuss
the
issue.
notice,
on
the
other
hand,
retains
the
ultimate
control
in
the
minor.
this
law
is
directed
at
the
process
of
ensuring
an
informed
decision,
and
not
the
end
result,
like
a
consent
law
is
directed.
the
law
merely
postpones
for
a
brief
period
of
time
in
order
to
permit
the
parents
to
consult
with
minors,
and
even
if
a
parent
disagrees,
the
minor
is
the
one
that
ultimately
makes
the
decision.
now,
i
submit
that
this
court
has
not
equated
notice
with
consent
in
the
parental
involvement
cases,
and
that
is
confirmed
by
a
footnote
in
the
matheson
case,
which
indicates
the
court's
view
that
in
bellotti
ii,
the
court
had
not
equated
notice
with
consent.
i
think
indisputably,
notice
is
a
much
less
intrusive
form
of
parental
involvement.
danforth
found
that
the
veto
is
the
constitutional
problem
with
the
parental
involvement
law,
and
the
minnesota
law
does
not
permit
a
parent
to
exercise
that
veto.
now,
with
respect...
let
me
return
to
the
second
parent
requirement.
i
submit
that
the
legislature
could
reasonably
insist
that
both
parents
be
notified,
and
reasonably
believe
that
a
two-parent
notice
system
would
serve
the
significant
state
interests
that
are
inherent
in
a
parental
notification
law
and
maximize
the
benefits
that--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--yes.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
justice
stevens,
there
are
other
statutes
which
require
notice
to
both
parents,
a
statute
that
requires
notice
to
both
parents
when
a
minor
seeks
a
name
change,
so
there's
one
instance
of
an
indication
in
which
notice
is
required
to
both
parents.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
well,
minnesota
law
does
provide
exceptions
to
the
general
rule
of
consent
for
certain
kinds
of
medical
treatment.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
in
other
areas?
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
justice
stevens,
the
state
does
not.
i
submit
to
the
court
that
there
are
very
different
interests
involved
there.
with
respect
to
the
exemptions
to
the
consent
law
that
are
in
the
statute,
there
are
compelling
medical
reasons
in
each
of
those
instances
for
treatment
and
a
very
strong
societal
interest
in
the
person
gaining
treatment.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
the
concern
that
by
notifying
parents
that
a
minor
is
undergoing
drug
abuse
treatment,
that
that
might
keep
a
minor
from
coming
in
to
get
treatment.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
yes,
your
honor.
but
in
following
up
with
justice
stevens'
question,
i
submit
that
the
abortion
situation
is
different
and
states
are
entitled
to
treat
abortion
differently.
there,
the
issue
is
a
decision
whether
or
not
to
undergo
elective
surgery
that
is
not
medically
indicated
for
any
particular
reason,
and
the
state's
interest
there
does
not
lie
in
getting
the
minor
in
to
get
treatment,
like
it
might
in
the
drug
abuse
area,
but
the
state
interest
there
is
in
a
thoughtful
and
informed
decision
on
the
part
of
the
minor.
this
court
has
indicated
many
times
that
abortion
is
different
and
unique
and
states
may
come
up
with
different
rules
to
treat
it
differently.
now,
going
back
to
the
issue
of
claims
raised
by
petitioners,
i
submit
that
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
undercut
in
any
respect
the
longstanding
cardinal
premise
that
parents
generally
act
in
their
childrens'
best
interests.
the
record
does
show
that
minors
and
parents
don't
always
agree.
the
record
does
show
that
minors
don't
like
to
tell
their
parents
unpleasant
facts,
and
the
record
shows
that
parents
often
react
normally
with--
--the
record
shows
that
parents
often
react
normally
with
grief
and
anger
and
fear
and
anguish
and
other
sorts
of
normal
parently
reactions.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
that
is
not
the
appropriate
role
of
a
trial
court
in
a
case
like
this.
but
what--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--well,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
entirely
clear,
your
honor.
i
think
what
the
petitioners
are
asking
is
that
this
court
reassess
the
factual
premises
that
underlie
the
matheson,
bellotti
ii
and
ashcroft
decisions.
and...
and
the
district
court
permitted
the
petitioners
to
try
to
establish
a
record
for
this
court
to
look
at
the
issue
of
whether
the
earlier
factual
premises
were
correct
or
not.
the
district
court,
after
all,
determined
that
the
notice
bypass
law
was
constitutional
facially
and
as
it
was
applied.
it
struck
it
down
after
looking
at
the
two-parent
requirement
and
the
48-hour
waiting
period
requirement
in
isolation,
in
holding
that
that
entire
statute
had
to
be
struck
down
because
of
those
two
provisions,
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
ruling
on
a
statute
that
had
a
bypass
in
effect,
which
would
enable
minors
to
entirely
avoid
those
two
particular
requirements.
i
submit
that
the
record
in
this
case
shows
absolutely
no
tangible
threat
to
the
health
of
the
minor
as
a
result
of
this
law.
the
pain...
plaintiffs
have
failed
to
demonstrate
that
any
minor
suffered
abuse
or
obstruction
as
a
result
of
this
law,
that
any
minor
suffered
any
medical
harm
as
a
result
of
this
law,
that
the
minimal
delays
engendered
by
the
statute
caused
any
kind
of
statistically
significant
risk
or
that
minors
were
forced
into
unwanted
motherhood
or
second-trimester
abortions.
simply
put,
this
is
not
a
record
that
should
convince
this
court
that
well-established
constitutional
standards
should
be
overturned
or
that
an
important
legislative
value
judgment
should
be
second-guessed.
i
submit
that
petitioners
do
have
a
heavy
burden
to
show
this
court
that
it
was
incorrect
earlier
and
that
its
judgments
on
such
a
fundamental
area
of
law
are
now
archaic.
all
the
arguments
that
have
been
raised
and
considered
in
this
case
were
raised
and
considered
in
the
context
of
the
earlier
decisions.
there
have
been
no
new
facts
of
substance
that
have
been
presented.
and
none
of
the
dire
consequences
predicted
in
the
earlier
cases
have
occurred.
and
i'd
ask
this
court
to
reaffirm
that
states
are
entitled
to
rely
upon
the
premises
underlying
well-settled
law
of
this
court
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
when
they
enact
important
legislation.
now,
let
me
address
briefly
the
issue
of
what
the
district
court
found
as...
as
to
the
purposes
of
the
law.
the
district
court
found
in...
in
finding
of
fact
number
67,
as
a
factual
matter,
that
the
state
had
not
proved
that
the
law
serves
state
interest
in
fostering
family
communications
and
protecting
pregnant
minors;
not
that
the
law
didn't
serve
its
purposes,
but
the
state
had
not
proved
that
the
law
didn't
serve
its
purposes.
i
submit
that
this
is
not
a
factual
finding,
but
a
conclusion
of
law,
or,
at...
at
the
very
least,
a
mixed
finding
of
law
and
fact
that's
due
no
deference
by
this
court.
and
i
submit
that
it
is
not
the
state's
obligation
to
reprove
the
factual
premises
of
strongly
established
constitutional
law,
especially
in
a
case
in
which
there
is
a
summary
judgment
order
which
recognizes
that
this
court
has
concluded
that
such
a
law
serves
state
purposes.
in
fact,
the...
the
language
out
of
the
bellotti
ii
case
leaves
little
doubt
about
the
question.
the
court
said
that
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
states
further
a
constitutionally
permissible
end
by
encouraging
an
unmarried
pregnant
minor
to
seek
the
help
and
advice
of
her
parents
in
making
the
very
important
decision
whether
or
not
to
bear
a
child.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
i
submit,
justice
stevens,
that
that
particular
finding
simply
doesn't
make
any
sense.
if
a
minor
is
predisposed
to...
to
tell...
voluntarily
tell
one
parent
of
her
desire
to
have
an
abortion,
and...
and
then
obviously
does
not
want
to
tell
the
other
parent,
so
it
goes
through
the
court
bypass
procedure,
why...
why
would...
after...
after
going
through
the
court
bypass
procedure,
the
minor
is
at
the
same
place
where
she
was
before.
that...
that
there
is...
that
she
has
one
parent
that
she's
willing
to
talk
to.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
pardon?
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
that...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
let
me
just
point
out
though,
your
honors,
that
the...
the
finding
as
to
the
purpose
of
the
law
is
plainly
incorrect.
the
law's
purpose,
as...
as
has
been
recognized
by
this
court,
is
to
increase
the
potential
for
communication
between
parents
and
children
at
a
critical
time.
even
with
the
bypass
in
effect,
the
record
shows
a
doubling
of
parents
who
were
notified
during
the
time
that
the
law
was
in
effect.
the
webster
case
teaches
us
that
the
legitimate
purposes
of
a
law
are
not
undercut
if
the
law
is
not
always
helpful
in
every...
every
situation.
and
i
submit
also
that
the
finding
does
not
contradict
the
conclusion
that
a...
that
notice
is
reasonably
designed
to
serve
state
interests.
the
firding
demonstrates
what
happens
when
you...
when
a
court
goes
beyond
such
an
inquiry
to
weigh
the
costs
and
benefits
of
legislation.
the
eighth
circuit
rejected
that
finding
and...
and
so
should
this
court.
now,
with
respect
to
mature
and
best-interest
minors.
as
i
have
indicated,
this
court
has
not
yet
decided
the
issue
of
whether
a
notice
law
requires
a
bypass
as
it
applies
to
mature
and
best-interest
minors.
and
i
submit
that
since
a
notice
law
imposes
no
such
veto,
that
a
bypass
is
not
constitutionally
mandated
for
any
category.
and
i
will
point
out
again
that
minnesota
law
does
provide,
however,
certain
significant
exceptions
for
minors
that
the
legislature
has
deemed
mature.
for...
with
respect
to
mature
minors,
the
law
provides
an
exception
for
emancipated
minors.
no
notice
is
required
for
that
category.
members
of
this
court,
however,
have
noted
that
even
mature
minors
can
benefit
from
parental
advice
and
support.
and
members
of
the
court
have
also
recognized
that
mature
minors
are
better
able
to
resist
the
pressure
that
a
parent
can
put
on.
and
the
court
has
also
recognized
that
the
legislature...
legislatures
can
set
chronological
ages
which
may
be
imprecise.
now,
with
respect
to
the
best-interest
category,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
there
is
a
broad
exception
for
abuse
victims.
and
to
get
back
to
the
issue
of
parents...
of
parents
eventually
finding
out
about
a
report
of
suspected
abuse,
there
exists
that
possibility,
but
under
no
situation
could
that
occur
until
after
the
abortion
takes
place.
i
remind
the
court
that
under
minnesota
law,
the
source
of
the
report
is
confidential,
and
the...
the...
the
notification
of
parents,
if
it
does
occur,
is...
is
a
decision
that...
that
can
be
made
by
child
protection
authorities,
and
they
may
withhold
knowledge...
may
withhold
that
notification
if
they
feel
that
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
child
in
the
situation.
there's
also
a...
a...
an
emergency
exception
in
the
law
which
allows
an
abortion
to
take
place
where
it
is
necessary
to
prevent
the
death
of
the
mother.
if
the
court
somehow
believes
that...
that
notice
is
more
burdensome
to
a
mature
and
best-interest
minor,
i
would
point
out
that
the
legislature
has
exempted
those
with
truly
compelling
needs.
now,
with
respect
briefly
to
the
waiting
period
of
48
hours,
there
is
a
significant
state
interest
in
a
reasonable
waiting
period
following
the
notification.
it
provides
an
opportunity
for
a
parent
to
react
to
the
notice,
for
the
parent
to
communicate
with
the
minor,
and
for
the
minor
to
reflect
upon
that
communication.
and
there
is
no
reason
shown
in
this
record
or
elsewhere
why
48
hours
is
not
a
reasonably...
reasonable
time
to...
to
wait
following
the
notification,
especially
in
situations
such
as...
as
minnesota,
where
parents
may
live
in
outlying
communities
and
may
receive
the
notice
of
the
abortion
after
the
minor
has
left
for
a
metropolitan
area
to
have
the
abortion
take
place.
and
with
respect
to
the
burden
of
a
waiting
period--
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
--certainly,
your
honor.
that...
that's
true.
in
minnesota,
the
evidence
suggests
that
abortions
are
provided
only
in
the
metropolitan
areas
of
minneapolis,
st.
paul
and
duluth,
and
it...
it
takes
some
period
of
time
to
travel
to
those
areas
at
times,
and
i
suspect
that
that's
the
situation
in
most
states.
the
district
court
somehow
viewed
the
48-hour
waiting
period
as
causing
a
possibility
of
a
delay
of...
of
more
than
one
week.
what
the
court,
however,
failed
to
recognize,
is
that
the
waiting
period
can
start
simply
by
a
phone
call
to
an
abortion
provider
and
that
it
can
run
concurrently
with
any
other
delay
that
might
be
imposed
on
the
process.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
scheduling
practices
of
the
providers
suggests
that
most
abortions
will
not
take
place
immediately,
but
generally
it
takes
two
or
three
days
before
the...
the
abortion
is
scheduled.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
justice
stevens,
notice
is
provided
under
the
minnesota
law
by
either
the
physician
or
an
agent
of
the
physician.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
it
can
be
written
notice.
it
can
be...
it
can
be
personal
delivery
of
the
notice,
or
it
can
be
mailed
delivery
with
the
presumption.
mr.
john
r.
tunheim
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
and,
in
fact,
the
law
includes
a
presumption
that...
that
the
delivery
is
mailed
and
received
at
noon
on
the
day
following
delivery.
so,
there's
a
conclusive
presumption
of
delivery.
in
concluding,
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
urge
this
court
to
find
that
minnesota's
notification
law
represents
an
appropriate
and
constitutional
balance
among
significant
state
interests
in
parental
communication,
in
parents'
rights
and
responsibilities
and
minors'
interests
in
choosing
an
abortion.
thank
you
very
much.
