chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-1125,
jane
hodgson
v.
minnesota;
no.
88-1309,
minnesota
v.
jane
hodgson.
ms.
benshoof,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
all
testified
to
at
that
trial,
ms.
benshoof?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
wasn't
just
studies
or...
but
witnesses
got
on
the
stand
and
said
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ms.
benshoof,
weren't...
those
were
claims
where
the
absent
father
asserted
a
constitutional
claim--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--which
we
rejected.
we
certainly
didn't
say
that
the
state
couldn't
recognize
such
an
interest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
whether...
whether
or
not...
they
are...
they
are
constitutional
interests,
the
state
might
choose
to
promote
them,
might
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
when
the
court
looks
at
those
interests,
it's
generally
looking
at
them
in
terms
of
a
constitutional
challenge.
someone
is
saying,
i
have
a
liberty
interest,
the
absent
parent,
the
single
mother.
but
when
the
state
comes
to
legislate,
it
doesn't
have
to
protect...
it's
not
limited
to
protecting
just
constitutional
interests.
it
can
protect
interests
of
its
citizens
as
it
sees
them
so
long
as
it
doesn't
run
up
against
some
other
constitutional
barrier,
can't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
district
court's
holding
with
respect
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
bypass
procedure?
did
it
uphold
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
construed
in
a
particular
way
and
up...
upheld
the
bypass
part?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
benshoof.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tunheim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
you
explain
just
what...
what...
what
is
this
substitute
provision
of
the
law,
mr.
tunheim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see.
from
many
medical
procedures
in
general...
and
perhaps
this
is
what
you've
been
over
with
justice
blackmun...
i
understand
you
to
say
that
in
minnesota
the
requirement
is
not
simply
notification
on
the
part
of
a
minor,
but
consent
of
one
parent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr....
mr.
tunheim,
what
is
the
point
of
a
record
in
a
case
such
as
this?
do
trial
courts
ordinarily
redetermine
for
themselves
the
facts
that
the
legislature
may
have
taken
into
consideration
in
passing
a
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
the
trial
court
here
do
it,
do
you
know?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tunheim.
ms.
benshoof,
you
have
five
minutes.
is
it
bens
hoof
or
ben
shoof?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ben
shoof.
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
that
an
ordinary
thing
you
would
expect
a
district
court
to
do,
to
hold
a
factual
trial
on
whether
a
statute
"achieves"
the
goals
that
the
legislature
set
out
to
achieve?
i...
i
frankly
never
heard
of
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
that...
that
was
a...
that
was
a
first
amendment
case.
i
mean,
where...
where
you...
where
there
may
be
a
different
rule,
in
the
ordinary
case
do
you
think
the
legislature
is
simply
subject
to
being
second-guessed
on
the
facts
by
a
trial
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
was
some
dispute
within
our
court
as
to
whether
that
should
have
been
done.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
thank
you,
ms.
benshoof.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
