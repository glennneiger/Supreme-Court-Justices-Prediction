ms.
janet
benshoof
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
constitutionality
of
a
1981
criminal
minnesota
statute
requiring
both
biological
parents
to
be
notified
prior
to
a
minor's
abortion.
the
issue
here
is
not
one
of
parental
involvement.
the
heart
of
our
case
is
the
two-parent
requirement
which
not
only
is
out
of
step
with
the
reality
of
family
life
but
which
tramples
on
the
integrity
of
many
families.
because
the
statutory
scheme
was
written
in
the
alternative,
there
are
two
statutory
schemes
before
the
court
today.
subdivision
2,
where
we
are
the
appellees,
requires
that
both
biological
parents
be
notified
48
hours
prior
to
any
teenager's
abortion.
this
notification
requirement
is
imposed
across-the-board
regardless
of
whether
the
minor
lives
in
a
no-parent,
one-parent
or
two-parent
household,
regardless
of
whether
she
is
mature,
or
whether
it
would
be
in
her
best
interest
to
have
a
private
abortion,
regardless
of
whether
she
has
ever
met
the
absent
parent.
under
subdivision
2,
no
bypass
option
is
possible
with
this
notice
even
when
the
minor,
her
natural
parent
and
her
stepparent
together
agree
that
abortion
is
the
best
choice
and
to
notice
to
the
absent
family
is
likely
to
be
destructive
to
the
family.
subdivision
6,
where
we're
the
appellant,
was
in
effect
for
five
years.
it
imposes
the
same
notice
and
waiting
period
requirement
but
contains
a
judicial
bypass.
after
five
weeks
of
trial
and
hearing
the
testimony
of
some
57
witnesses,
the
trial
court
federal
court
judge
in
minnesota
made
comprehensive
findings
of
fact
as
to
the
impact
and
the
operation
of
this
law
on
minors,
on
medical
practice,
on
their
privacy
rights
and
on
their
families.
50
percent
of
minors
in
minnesota
who
are
seeking
abortions
do
not
live
with
both
biological
parents.
ms.
janet
benshoof
yes,
it
was.
ms.
janet
benshoof
absolutely.
far
from
helping
minors
or
families,
this
statute
tries
to
force
a
parental
role
where
one
may
never
have
existed.
it
undermined
families
that
do
exist
and
drove
minors
from
timely,
critical
medical
care.
i
would
first
like
to
address
subdivision
2,
where
we
are
the
appellees.
the
state
argues
that
biological
parents
have
a
right
to
know,
a
right
which
they
contend
is
older
in
history
than
any
privacy
or
bodily
integrity
rights
of
minors.
they
further
argue
that
having
a
judicial
bypass
defeats
these
constitutional
rights
of
parents.
however,
in
ashcroft,
akron
and
bellotti,
this
court
clearly
held
that
an
effective
bypass
mechanism
had
to
be
held
for
any
parental
involvement
requirement
in
order
to
ensure
that
mature
minors
and
best
interest
minors
were
not
forced
to
forego
those
privacy
rights
recognized
in
danforth.
this
court
has
consistently
recognized
both
the
unique
and
the
non-postponable
nature
of
the
abortion
decision,
and
the
fact
that
imposition
of
unwanted
motherhood
on
a
teenager
is
particularly
devastating
to
her
future.
this
state's
right-to-know
theory
ignores
danforth
in
which
this
court
said
that
any
independent
right
of
the
parent
that
may
exist
is
no
more
weighty
than
a
minor's
privacy
right;
and,
in
fact,
even
the
dissent
in
danforth
in
this
court
looked
at
the
minor's
welfare,
not
at
some
independent,
completely
right
of
the
parent
absent
any
consideration
of
the
welfare
of
the
minor.
apart
from
this
right-to-know
theory
in
this
case,
this
court
has
never
supported
the
idea
of
giving
fundamental
due
process
rights
to
any
sort
of
parent
who's
never
lived
with
the
child,
acknowledged
the
child,
supported
the
child,
or
whose
abusive
actions
to
the
other
parent
or
the
child
are
destructive.
this
court
has
been
repeatedly
skeptical
of
the
claims
of
absentee
fathers.
in
lehr,
for
example,
an
unmarried
father
with
no
ongoing
relationship
with
the
child,
was
not
even
entitled
to
notice
of
a
pending
adoption.
ms.
janet
benshoof
yes--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--in
this
particular
case,
the
state
of
minnesota
is
arguing
that
these
parents
have
liberty
interests
which
the
state
has
to
promote
or
otherwise
they
are
in
effect
vetoed.
ms.
janet
benshoof
well,
the
state
could
promote
interests
that
are
not
constitutional
interests,
but
then
they
would
be
balanced
against
rights
and
constitutional
interests
in
the
minor
and,
i
might
add,
her
single
mother,
so
that
those
rights
would
even
be
less
cognizable
than
if
they
would
be
liberty
interests.
and
i
do
agree
that
at...
you
know,
biological
parents
may
have
some
degree
of
liberty
interests,
but
this
court
has
always
looked
at
those
interests
along
a
spectrum.
ms.
janet
benshoof
it
absolutely
can.
but
in
this
instance
they
are
framing
those
in
terms
of
rights
and
constitutional
interests
of
the
parents
that
are
more
weighty
than
the
privacy
interests
of
the
minor
at
hand,
and
they
are
saying
that
a
bypass
procedure,
in
effect,
cuts
off
those
interests.
even
parents
with
recognized
liberty
interests
don't
have
a
right
to
protective
state
legislation
to
impinge
on
privacy
interests
balanced
on
the
other
side.
ms.
janet
benshoof
well,
there's
two
sorts
of
privacy
interests.
first
of
all,
there
is
the
privacy
interest
recognized
in
roe
and
danforth
that
a
mature
minor
and
a
minor
whose
best
interest
it
is
has
an
interest
independent
of
her
parents
to
be
able
to
ineffectuate
an
abortion
decision.
ms.
janet
benshoof
apart
from--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--absolutely.
i
think
that
the
family
integrity
cases
such
as
moore,
informational
privacy
cases,
for
example,
when
a
minor
and
her
mother
agree
that
an
abusive
ex-husband...
and
we
have
a
named
plaintiff
in
that
situation,
for
example...
and
i
think
this
example
illustrates
your
point...
a
named
minor
and
her
mother
are
both
plaintiffs
in
this
suit
where
the
father
was
divorced,
she
lives
in
a
family
with
a
stepfather,
the
natural
father
has
held
a
gun
to
the
mother's
head
several
times,
and
she
only
speaks
to
him
with
a
policeman
present.
yet,
the
state--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--it
would
be
phrased,
first
of
all,
in
the--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--privacy
interest
to
be
able
to
choose
to
have
the
abortion--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--then
there
would
be--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--a
privacy
interest
in
informational
privacy
such
as
this
court
recognized
in
whalen
v.
roe,
a
private
to
make...
to
keep
independent
information
personal
to
oneself.
there's
also
the
privacy
interest
in
being
able
to
live
in
a
new...
in
a
family
setting
of
your
choosing,
which
this
court
recognized
in
moore.
so,
in
essence,
this
court
doesn't
even
need
to
look
at
the
abortion
cases
to
find
that
the
rights
of
minors
of
natural
parents,
of
single
parents,
are
violated
in
this
case
by
the
state
in
forcing...
in
effect,
forcing
unrelated
adults
to
give
very
personal
information,
often
inflaming
information,
to
each
other.
nothing
in
this
statute
forbids
minors
from
voluntarily
telling
one
parent.
in
fact,
most
do.
single
parents
under
the
statute
are
free
to
talk
to
ex-spouses.
this
is
not
the
doctor...
the
state
coming
in
and
cutting
out
any
rights.
in
fact,
nothing
precludes
a
doctor
from
making
an
independent
judgment
in
this
case
that
a
particular
minor
needs
a
parent
or
adult
to
be
involved.
minnesota
law
has
a
specific
statute
which
we
mentioned
in
our
brief
which
provides
that
when
a
doctor
sees
a
health
need
and
he's
treating
a
minor
for
a
confidential
matter,
he
may
inform
the
parents
if
failure
to
do
so
would
jeopardize
the
minor's
health.
the
district
court
in
this
case
made
very
clear
findings
of
fact
about
single
parent
homes
and
about
intact
homes
which
are,
in
effect,
violent
or
dysfunctional
families.
yet,
the
statute
requires
that
the
second
parent
be
notified
regardless
of
the
living
situation,
the
minor
and
her
single
mother
or
the
minor
and
her
parents
may
be
living
in.
in
many
instance
we
have
divorced
mothers
as
plaintiffs
where
the
divorce
took
place
under
very
abusive
situations.
there
is
no
state
interest
for
the
state
to
force
the
parent
who
has
been
a
sole
custodian
for
16
years
to
go
to
an
ex-husband
and
reveal
this
personal
information.
the
state
interest
in
this
case
is
helping
immature
minors.
if
they
have
the
loving
support
of
one
parent,
often
who
has
to
under
considerable
trauma,
expense,
go
to
a
state
court
judge
with
that
minor,
there
is
no
state
interest
achieved.
the
statute
is
very
overbroad,
in
that
it
requires
two
parents
across-the-board.
we
have
even
instances
in
the
record
where
they've
never
met
this
parent
that
they
have
to
ferret
out
and
give
this
very,
very
personal
information.
ms.
janet
benshoof
well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
when
minors'
rights
are
at
stake
because,
as
this
court
recognized
in
bellotti
and
i
think
justice
stevens
particularly
recognized
in
carey,
minors
who
are
pregnant
need
more
protection
from
this
court
than
even
in
other
areas
because
they
only
have
two
options
left
in
their
life
at
that
point.
however,
under
any
standard
of
review,
this
is
irrational.
for
example,
in
turner
v.
safley,
you
scrutinized
the
factual
record
very
carefully
to
show
that
there
was
no
fit
between
forbidding
inmate
marriages
and
relating
that
to
the
penological
concerns
of
the
state
of
missouri.
moreover,
in
castle
v.
consolidated
freightways,
which
was
a
1981
case
of
this
court,
there
was
a
14-day
trial
on
the
safety
effects
of
banning
65-foot
trailers
in
iowa,
and
you
found
that
although
there
was
some
slight
safety
benefit,
there
was
not
much
and
it
didn't...
it
wasn't
reasonable
or
rational
to
require
that
ban
because
of
its
burden
on
interstate
commerce.
ms.
janet
benshoof
i
think
that's
very
apt
because
first
of
all
we're
not
saying
the
state
is
deprived
of
authority
here,
we're
not
disputing
the
legitimacy
of
the
state
interest.
certainly,
parental
involvement
is
a
laudable
and
beneficial
goal.
what
we
have
proved
in
this
case
is
that
the
means
chosen
not
only
don't
achieve
that
goal,
but
they
undermine
that
goal;
they
undermine
the
very
thing
the
state
wants
to
achieve.
and
in
castle
you
did
use
a
rational
basis
test.
if
the
test
used
on
trucks
in
iowa
were
applied
to
minor's
health
rights,
we
would
win
this
case.
the
state
argues
that
somehow
notice
is
different
than
consent;
that
somehow
notice
is
less
burdensome
than
consent,
and
that's
another
reason
why
a
lesser
standard
of
review
should
be
used
by
this
court.
i
would
submit
that
the
facts
show
the
exact
opposite.
that
notice
is
not
less
burdensome
than
consent.
while
parents
may
perceive
a
difference
in
a
consent
law
versus
a
notice
law,
from
the
point
of
view
of
minors,
whose
rights
are
at
stake
in
this
case,
there
is
no
difference
between
them
for
three
reasons.
first...
first
of
all,
there's
no
difference
between
notice
and
consent
for
the
potential
for
provoking
obstruction
and
violence.
the
district
court
reported
that
there
are
31,000
cases
of
family
assault
every
year
in
minnesota,
making
it
the
most
prevalent
violent
crime
in
the
state
of
minnesota.
the
district
court
further
found
that
notice
in
these
kind
of
violent,
dysfunctional
families
was
nearly
always
disastrous.
in
fact,
the
only
two
expert
witnesses
put
on
trial
by
the
state
of
minnesota
admitted
on
cross-examination
that
yes,
it's
true
in
these
kinds
of
cases
it
would
not
be
beneficial,
and
yes,
it's
true,
violence
could
occur.
now
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
parents
who
would
veto
an
abortion
though...
through
threatened
or
actual
violence,
would
not
equally
obstruct
a
minor's
access
to
a
clinic
or
a
court
after
being
notified.
in
fact,
that
was
precisely
what
this
court
recognized
in
bellotti.
they
said,
in
looking
at
the
fact
that
the
state
of
massachusetts
required
you
to
be
notified...
required
parents
to
be
notified
before
going
to
court
said,
wait,
minors
must
have
the
right
to
go
to
court
first
and
anonymously,
because
parents
may
block
access
if...
to
the
court
itself
if
they
were
notified.
so
violent
reactions,
such
as
beating,
being
thrown
out
the
home,
which
are
not
uncommon,
are
precipitated
by
the
knowledge,
not
by
whether
the
minor
says
hey,
wait
a
minute,
i'm
not
asking
for
consent.
second,
the
burden
on
informational
privacy,
the
having
to
give
this
very
personal
information
to
someone
who
may
be
a
stranger,
both
on
mature
minors
and
on
their
single
parents,
is
the
same
under
a
notice
or
consent
statute.
minors
and
single
parents
have
compelling
reasons
for
not
to
disclose
a
pregnancy
for
a
second
biological
parent.
several
of
our
class
members,
and
this
is
all
in
the
record,
had
dying
or
disabled
parents.
one
had
a
father
who
just
had
a
stroke
whose
father's
doctor
said,
do
not
tell
him.
and
her
mother
totally
agreed.
yet
the
state
wouldn't
even
give
them
a
bypass;
they
would
force
this
father
with
his
stroke
to
be
told.
now
it
makes
no
difference
telling
that
father
with
the
stroke
whether
or
not
you're
asking
him
for
consent
or
asking
him
to
sign
a
form
that
yes,
he
has
been
notified.
there
is
no
difference
whatsoever.
finally,
this
court's
cases
invalidating
parental
notice
were
based
on
the
right
of
mature
minors
to
decide
not
to
become
teenage
mothers.
and
the
trial
in
this
case
makes
clear
that
a
notice
requirement
imposed
on
minors,
and
in
this
case
nearly
half
went
through
the
bypass,
which
was
no
easy
task,
but
the
notice
requirement
itself
is
such
a
deterrent
that
it
is
an
equal
deterrent
to
any
form
of
consent.
now
the
defendants
argue
that
while
all
of
this
may
very
well
be
true,
that...
that
there
may
be
some
burdens
imposed
by
a
notice
that...
a
72-hour
notice
that
can
extend
into
a
week,
and
there
may
be
some
burdens
imposed
by
having
to
notify
an
absent
parent
who
is
in
a
mental
hospital,
a
fugitive
to
justice,
dying,
or
beats
the
family
regularly,
or
is
under
an
order
of
protection,
that
may
be
true,
but
there
is
always
the
judicial
bypass.
but
i
would
submit
that
the
district
court
was
correct
in
saying
that
a
judicial
bypass
cannot
immunize
the
underlying
notice
requirement
from
judicial
scrutiny.
yes,
it
is
necessary.
it
is
necessary
because
there
are
situations
even
in
intact
families
where
there
is
violence
occurring.
and
in
fact,
most
of
the...
as
the
district
court
found,
many
of
the
families
which
are
violent
families,
are
intact
families,
there
is
a
notice...
a
reason
for
this
bypass.
but
the
two-parent
requirement
is
clearly
overbroad
because
the
bypass
itself
is
burdensome.
and
you
can't
just
impose
this
burden
without
looking
at
the
notice.
the
bypass
is
burdensome
because
it
takes
minors
about
an
average
of
a
week
to
go
through
the
bypass
in
minnesota,
which
the
district
court
judge
found
to
be
medically
significant.
and
this
is
no
small
matter
for
minors.
a
week
increases
the
mortality
risk
about
50
percent.
oftentimes
this
stretched
into
more
than
a
week,
and
we
have
several
instances
of
our
brief
with
named
plaintiffs
who
went
two
or
three
weeks.
it
also
increases
other
risks,
pushing
many
minors
into
second
trimester
abortions,
which
are
offered
only
in
one
city
in
the
entire
state
of
minnesota.
some
minors
had
to
go
out
of
state,
in
fact.
this
makes
abortions
much
more
expensive
and
much
more
dangerous
for
minors.
moreover,
the
judicial
bypass,
especially
when
one
parent
has
to
go
along,
the
court
found
undermined
the
kind
of
communication
and
support
that
a
single
parent
was
trying
to
offer
her
daughter
during
this
time
of
trouble.
for
example,
one
of
our
named
plaintiffs,
who
had
not
seen
her
ex-husband
for
over
10
years,
was...
and
had
sole
custody,
was
forced
to
go
to
court
with
her
daughter
and
reveal
immediately
before
the
abortion
where
she
was
trying
to
be
completely
supportive...
reveal
before
a
state
court
judge
that
well,
she
had
to
divorce
her
husband
for
abuse,
which
her
daughter
didn't
know
about.
so
that
she
had...
she
had
her
choice
of
notifying
an
abusive
ex-husband,
going
to
a
state
court
judge
and
letting
this
information
come
out
before
her
daughter,
who
was
pregnant
and
who
she
was
just
taking
to
the
clinic.
this
is
not
a
real
choice.
but
more
importantly,
this
is
not
necessary.
this
does
not
achieve
anything.
even
an
immature
minor,
if
they
have
the
loving
support
of
one
parent,
there's
no
reason
for
the
state
to
impose
such
a
draconian
requirement
that
the
district
court
found
imposed
burdens
on
real
families,
on
real
people,
that
not
only
interfered
with
communication,
but
impaired
the
health
of
young
people.
ms.
janet
benshoof
the
district
court
struck
down
the
statute
in
its
entirety
because
they
found
the
two-parent
requirement
was
overbroad.
they
found
that
the
bypass
was
a
burden,
but
they
would
not
strike
that
down
under
this
court's
previous
opinions,
and
felt
that
because
it
was
a
burden,
it
had
to
be
narrowly
tailored,
and
not
imposed
on
people
who
should
not
have
to
go
through
it,
such
as
people
who
had
the
support
of
one
parent.
ms.
janet
benshoof
it
invalidated
the
entire
statute,
it...
because
of
the
two-parent
requirement
not
being
severable.
and
i
would
want
to
add
that
besides
the
two-parent
requirement,
this
statute
pretends
to
exempt
two
other
categories
of
minors
for
whom
this
would
do...
would
accomplish
no
state
interest,
and
those
are
emancipated
minors
and
abused
minors.
this
statute
pretends
on
its
face
to
apply
only
to
unemancipated
minors.
but
there's
no
definition
of
emancipation.
in
fact,
the
case
law
in
minnesota
says
it's
a
question
for
the
jury.
well,
of
course,
the
only
way
to
get
a
declaration
would
be
to
bring
your
parents
into
court,
which
makes
it
an
impossible
exemption.
because
this
is
a
criminal
statute,
the
clinics
are
very
reluctant
to
look
at
a
minor's
situation,
and
say,
i'm
guessing
that
you're
emancipated.
so
emancipated
minors,
in
effect,
have
to
go
through
court.
many
minors
who
have
children
go
to
court.
there
have
been
married
minors
going
to
court,
and
minors
living
completely
separated
from
their
parents
going
to
court.
moreover,
this
statute
says
well,
abused
minors,
victims
of
incest.
if
they've
reported
this
and
they're
past
victims,
they
don't
have
to
notify.
but
it
turns
out
that
the
reporting
statute
in
minnesota
requires
that
after
it's
reported
to
the
welfare
department,
the
welfare
department
has
to
do
an
assessment
and
tell
the
parents
about
the
assessment.
this
could
all
be
done
in
a
time
frame
even
before
the
abortion
occurs.
so,
in
effect,
the
two
exceptions
which
the
state
relies
on
in
their
brief
for
narrowly
tailoring
their
statute,
are
not
exceptions
at
all,
which
we've
showed
in
practice.
ms.
janet
benshoof
it
doesn't
say
both
biological...
nothing
ever
says
both
biological;
this
is
new
to
this
statute.
it
says
parents,
and
i
imagine
they
are
referring
to
functional
parents.
ms.
janet
benshoof
that
is
an
assessment
after
the
welfare...
welfare
department
has
assessed
the
situation.
that
does
not
mean,
however,
that
they
will
necessarily
reveal
where
their
source
came
from.
but
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
that
the
source
is
found
out
and
the
district
court
made
a
clear
finding
of
fact
that
this
leads
to
them
finding
out
that
the
minor
indeed
revealed
this
during
the--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--right.
but
somebody
has
to
report
it,
and
when
the
clinic
reports
it,
it
gets
back
to
where
the
reporting
came
from.
although
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says
notify
the
parents
that
you've
done
an
investigation
of
abuse,
and
tell
where
you
got
the
information.
that
is
not
in
there,
but
that
is
what
happens
in
practice.
and
it
is
in
practice
with
what
we
showed
the
court.
the
state
has
argued
that
this
court's
previous
cases
involving
the
facie
validity
of
consent
statutes
preclude
any
looking
at
the
facts
in
this
case.
but
first
of
all,
this
statute
is
written
in
a
completely
different
way
than
any
statute
previously
before
this
court.
although
the
massachusetts
statute
in
bellotti,
which
did
look
at
a
consent
statute
which
talked
about
two-parent
consent,
there
was
an
exception
in
that
for
fathers,
let's
say,
who
had
deserted
the
family
and,
moreover,
there
was
an
exception
in
that
in
the
opinion
itself
in
which
you
spoke
of
at
least
when
the
minor
is
living
at
home
with
two
parents.
that
is
not
the
case
in
this
particular
situation.
no
other
case
has
demonstrated
the
actual
burdens
and
the
benefits
based
on
actual
experience.
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
sable
communications,
no
matter
what
deference
to
legislative
findings
the
court
must
engage
in,
you
cannot
forego
examining
the
facts
in
constitutional
cases.
there
were
clear
findings
in
this
case
on
the
burdens
which
were
almost
entirely
imposed
on
mature
and
best-interest
minors,
including
medically
significant
delays
and
including
the
fact
that
some
minors
had
to
forego
the
opportunity
to
have
an
abortion
entirely
and
had
unwanted
teenage
motherhood
imposed
on
them,
which
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
is
a
life-stifling
burden.
this
is
not
the
case
of
a
statute
that
just
may
be
imprecise
or
unjust
in
a
few
cases.
we're
not
asking
for
that.
in
fact,
the
district
court
judge
said,
"i
cannot
after
five
weeks
of
trial
find
that
any
benefits
outweigh
the
burdens
imposed,
nor
were
the
state
interests
in
this
case
promoted
more
than
they
were
undermined.
"
i
would
like
to
save
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
ms.
janet
benshoof
thank
you.
ms.
janet
benshoof
ben
shoof.
ms.
janet
benshoof
thank
you.
first
of
all,
the
state
has
argued
that
we
want
this
court
to
abandon
bellotti,
and
that
is
not
true.
we're
asking
this
court
only
to
apply
the
principles
that
it's
articulated
in
previous
cases.
what
we
are
objecting
to
here
are
the
means
and
what
we
had
the
trial
on
are
whether
the
particular
means,
this
particular
statute
drafted
by
the
legislature
in
minnesota,
achieves
the
goals
and
what
the
district
court
found
in
very
arduous
and
careful
fact-finding
was
not
only
they
were
not
achieved,
but
that
they
were
undermined.
ms.
janet
benshoof
absolutely.
for...
i
think
this
court
in
many
cases...
i
think
the
whole
basis
of
constitutional
review
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
fit
between
the
articulated
purposes
and
the...
and
whether
or
not
those
purposes
are
achieved.
ms.
janet
benshoof
in
craig
v.
boren
you
looked
as
to
whether
the
differential
between
men
and
women
contributed
to
highway
safety.
certainly
in
buckley
v.
valeo
you
pointed
out
that
you're
upholding
the
campaign
financing
laws,
but
should
we
come
back
later
and
show
that
minor
parties
are,
in
fact,
discriminated
against,
you
would
reexamine
that.
ms.
janet
benshoof
well,
certainly
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
iowa
was
second-guessed
on
a
65-foot
truck.
ms.
janet
benshoof
well,
there
may
have
been
dispute,
but
i--
[laughter]
i'm
sorry
you
weren't
on
my
side.
but
i'm
citing
the
majority.
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
abortion
being
different,
i'd
like
to
point
out
that,
yes,
you've
allowed
abortion
to
be
treated
differently,
but
never
have
you
not
looked
at
all
the
state
interests
to
see
whether
this
really
is
a
state
interest.
for
example,
in
griswold,
you
said
is
the
state
really
protecting
marital
fidelity?
let's
look
at
their
other
statutes.
justice
white,
in
his
dissent
in
michael
h.,
said
is
this
really
protecting
against
the
stigma
of
illegitimacy?
let's
look
at
the
fact
that
a
father
can
raise
it.
well,
in
minnesota,
are
they
really
protecting
the
parents'
rights
to
help
a
child
when
they
let...
they
have
specific
minors'
consent
to
health
care
where
minors
can
have
complete
privacy
in
pregnancy
testing,
v.d.
testing
and
treatment,
penicillin,
which
is
more
dangerous
than
an
abortion,
prenatal
care,
childbirth...
you
can
consent
to
a
cesarean
section
at
age
14
in
minnesota,
and
yet
you
have
to
notify
a
father
you
may
never
have
seen.
i
would
not
say
that
you
have
to
treat
abortion
differently
because
that's
not
what
this
court
has
said,
but
certainly
the
strength
and
integrity
of
the
state
interest
in
this
case
i
would
submit
is
a
bit
suspect.
and
going
to
the
emergency
exception,
there
really
is
no
emergency
exception
in
this
statute
for
health
problems.
one
class
member
that
we
represent,
for
example,
was
aborting
spontaneously.
she
came
in
with
a
health
problem
with
her
mother.
they
were
forced
to
go
to
court
because
they
could
not
notify
the
absent
father,
and
they
were
forced
to
go
to
court,
taking
a
nurse
with
them
while
they
aborted
in
court,
to
go
through
the
bypass
in
order
to
comply
with
this
statute.
certainly
that
doesn't
achieve
any
interest
that
anyone
could
possibly
imagine.
fourth,
i
think--
ms.
janet
benshoof
--yes.
emergency
is
not
only
confined
to
death,
but
you
have
to
die
within
three
days.
[laughter]
ms.
janet
benshoof
absolutely
not,
and
death
has
to
be
within
three
days.
so
that
moreover,
even...
even
minors
who
have
dead
parents
are
burdened
under
this
statute
because
this
statute
requires
in
its
penalty
provision
that
the
clinics
collect
written
proof,
so
you
have
to
bring
in
funeral
certificates
or
death
certificates
which
take
for
some
of
our
minors...
it's
in
the
record...
two
or
three
weeks.
ms.
janet
benshoof
because
it...
yeah,
the
written
notice.
yes,
the
time
within
the
written
notice
which
the
district
court
judge
made
a
finding
of
fact
that
72
hours
was
the
normal
time.
ms.
janet
benshoof
well,
i
think
the
point
is
that
that
exception
was
never
used
when
this
statute
was
in
effect
for
five
years,
but
certainly
the
health
exception,
i
think,
is
a
more
ordinary
exception,
particularly
when
one
parent
comes
in.
and
minors
do
have
health
problems.
i
think
what
we
have
to
remember
here
is
that
for
a
young
person
childbirth,
for
example,
for
a
girl
under
the
age
15,
is
ten
times
as
risky
as
death
as
for
a
woman
in
her
twenties.
