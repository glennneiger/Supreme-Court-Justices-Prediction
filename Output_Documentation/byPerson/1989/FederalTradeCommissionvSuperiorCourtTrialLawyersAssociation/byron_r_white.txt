boycott
do
you...
you
just
have
an
agreement...
we
just
won't
work
for
any
less
than
a
certain
amount?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
are
correct
on
your
contention
that
the
per
se
rule
applies,
is
anything
left
to
be
tried
in
the
case,
or
will
judgment
just
be
entered
in
your
favor?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
happens
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
situation
here
is
where
a
public
body
is
going
to
set
the
price
that
is
going
to
be
paid
for
services
it
gets,
so
there
is
just
only
going
to
be
one
price.
and
i
suppose,
in
the
steel
case,
if
they
announced
we
will
pay...
the
government
announced
we
will
pay
x
dollars
a
ton
for
steel,
the
steel
companies
would
nevertheless
be
in...
in
competition
with
each...
one
another,
no
matter
what
the
price
was.
they
would
be
bidding
and
they,
they
would
be
chosen
based
on
nonprice
factors.
but
here,
these
lawyers
aren't
in
competition
at
all,
are
they,
with
one
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
per
se
rule,
i
take
it
is...
is...
it
is
so
often
that
price-fixing
is
so
often
fatal
to
competition,
that
what
is
treated
per
se.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
these...
these
lawyers
just
aren't...
don't
compete.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who...
how
are
individual
lawyers
chosen
for
individual
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
is
some
degree
of
competition
among
the
lawyers,
who
calls
first
on
the
telephone?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
at
least
in
the
doctors
case
the
patients
are
choosing
the
doctors--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
the
doctors
are
competing
with
one
another
to
be
chosen
by
patients.
that...
that
isn't
true
here.
they
aren't
being
hired
by
people
in
jail.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so,
this
case
is
no
different
than
we
are
choosing
lawyers
by
lot.
we
have
a
list
of
lawyers
here,
and
we
choose
them
by
lot.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
market
power...
if
you
don't
have
market
power,
you
haven't
violated
the
rule
of
reason?
or
did
they
say
that
if
you
have
market
power,
it
is
a
per
se
rule?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it...
it
rejected
the
claim
that
this
kind
of
an
agreement
was
a
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
think
that
if
on
remand
they
can't,
unless
market
power,
whatever
that
means...
if
that
isn't
proven,
there
is
no
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
urging
the
noerr
solution
which
would...
under
noerr,
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong,
the
case
is
over.
no
remand.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
we
have
to
disagree
with
the
court
of
appeals
then,
on
that
point.
