chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-1198,
federal
trade
commission
v.
superior
court
trial
lawyers
association
and
vice
versa.
mr.
isenstadt,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
show...
if
that
is
shown
before
the
commission
pursuant
to
the
court
of
appeals'
remand,
the
commission
would
prevail,
i
guess.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
you
would
need
to
show?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so,
this
was
not
a
case
of
the
court
of
appeals
saying
we
want
you
to
separate
the
lobbying
effort
from
the
boycott.
they
said
you
have
got
to
split
up
the
boycott
itself,
in
effect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
isenstadt.
mr.
tom,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
types
of
boycotts,
mr.
tom?
i
understood
your...
your
opponent
to
say
that
price...
price-fixing
implemented
by
a
boycott
had
always
been
deemed
a
per
se
violation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
both
the
federal
trade
commission
and
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
was
price-fixing,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do...
it
would
be
all
right
for
a
bunch
of
steel
suppliers
to
boycott
the
legislature,
to
boycott
selling
to
a
particular
state,
even
though...
as
long
as
they
had
a
campaign
going
on
to
raise
the
prices
that
that
state
would
pay
for
the
steel?
you
wouldn't
go
that
far,
would
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
there
is
a
rule.
where--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--oh,
a
possibility
of
a
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
court
of
appeals
treated
noerr,
and
thought
that
noerr
said
you
can
lobby
but
you
can't
boycott.
which,
frankly,
is
what
i
thought
noerr
said
too.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
noerr
didn't
approve
any
price-fixing
boycott,
did
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
your
clients
in
this
case
were
not
self
interested?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
you
could
find
that,
probably,
in
any
boycotting
group,
not
that
they
are
totally,
dominantly
self-interested,
but
that
self-interest
played
a
significant
part.
and
you
could
probably
find
too
that,
with
other
boycotting
groups,
you
know,
some
of
them
could
have
gone
into
some
other
business
and
made
more
money.
i
don't
know
what
that
adds.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tom.
mr.
isenstadt,
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
isenstadt.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
88-1198
federal
trade
commission
versus
superior
court
trial
lawyers
association.
in
this
case,
the
respondents
are
a
group
of
lawyers
who
represent
indigent
criminal
defendants
in
the
district
of
columbia.
during
a
part
of
1983,
they
agreed
to
refuse
further
clients
until
the
district
increase
their
fees.
the
district
eventually
capitulated
to
their
demand,
and
the
federal
trade
commission
initiated
an
enforcement
proceeding,
and
after
a
hearing
found
that
the
lawyers’
conduct
was
a
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws.
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
the
commission’s
order
but
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
stevens,
we
hold
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
insulate
respondents’
conduct
from
an
application
of
per
se
antitrust
analysis.
the
expressive
component
of
this
boycott
does
not
adequately
distinguish
it
from
other
price-fixing
agreements
subject
to
those
rules.
we
accordingly
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
marshall
joins;
justice
blackmun
has
also
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
