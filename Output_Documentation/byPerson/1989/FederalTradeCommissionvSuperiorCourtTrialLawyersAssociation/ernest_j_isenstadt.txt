mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
a
group
of
competing
private
practice
criminal
defense
attorneys
who
agreed
among
themselves
to
withhold
their
services
from
the
district
of
columbia
until
the
district
increased
the
price
it
paid
for
those
services.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
lawyers'
boycott
was
the
essence
of
price-fixing,
and
that
the
first
amendment
does
not
immunize
such
price-fixing
from
antitrust
review,
even
if
it
is
used
in
an
effort
to
induce
the
passage
of
legislation.
i
shall
argue
this
morning
that
in
these
two
respects,
the
court
of
appeals
was
clearly
correct
and
its
decision
should
be
affirmed.
then,
however,
the
court
reversed
course
and
held
that
the
first
amendment
requires
the
commission
to
prove
market
power
in
order
to
condemn
a
price-fixing
boycott
that
is
used
in
part
to
express
the
views
of
the
boycotters
on
a
matter
of
public
importance.
i
shall
argue
that
this
novel
exception
to
the
sherman
acts
per
se
prohibition
against
naked
price-fixing
agreements
is
unsupported
by
law
and
would
have
serious
effects
for
antitrust
enforcement
if
left
to
stand.
a
brief
review
of
the
facts
demonstrates
the
correctness
of
the
court
of
appeals'
conclusion
that
the
lawyers'
boycott
was
the
essence
of
price-fixing.
prior
to
the
boycott
the
district
of
columbia
government
offered
$30
per
hour
for
court
time
and
$20
per
hour
for
out-of-court
time
to
any
attorney
who
volunteered
to
represent
indigent
defendants
in
superior
court
under
the
criminal
justice
act.
no
attorney
was
required
to
offer
his
services
at
that
rate.
attorneys
who
wished
to
do
so
competed
for
the
city's
legal
business
by
calling
in
each
morning
and
asking
that
their
names
be
placed
on
a
list
from
which
counsel
was
assigned
that
day.
and
the
record
shows
that,
right
up
to
the
day
before
the
boycott,
enough
attorneys
volunteered
at
the
rates
offered
by
the
city
to
provide
counsel
for
all
indigent
defendants
who
required
it.
in
an
effort
to
obtain
an
increase
in
the
cja
rate,
the
lawyers
conducted
a
lobbying
campaign
in
late
1982
and
'83
with
which
no
one
takes
issue,
but
when
they
grew
dissatisfied
with
the
pace
and
results
of
the
city's
legislative
process,
they
met,
on
august
11,
1983,
and
agreed
among
themselves
that
if
the
rate
increase
were
not
forthcoming
by
september
6th
they
would
collectively
cease
to
accept
new
case
assignments.
the
boycott
began
as
intended,
and
as
the
lawyers
expected,
it
had
a
severe
impact
on
the
district
of
columbia
superior
court.
the
participants
in
the
boycott
comprise
nearly
all
those
who
had
at
the
time
made
a
practice
of
accepting
criminal
justice
act
cases.
the
few
attorneys
who
showed
up
to
accept
cases
during
the
boycott
became
quickly
overloaded,
prompting
the
head
of
the
public
defenders
service
to
write
mayor
barry
on
september
15
and
advise
him
that
the
available
attorney
pool
was
no
longer
sufficient
to
continue
to
assure
the
appointment
of
counsel
for
all
indigent
defendants.
in
response
to
that
communication,
the
mayor
recommended
and
the
city
council
enacted
legislation
increasing
the
cja
rate
to
$35
an
hour
for
both
in
court
and
out-of-court
time.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
technically,
your
honor,
if
three
attorneys
agreed
among
themselves,
of
course
any
attorney
in
the
exercise
of
his
own
individual
judgment
may
refuse
to
accept
case
assignments,
but
if
three
attorneys
agreed,
that
would
be
per
se
unlawful...
agreed
that
they
would
not
accept
assignments
until
the
price
was
increased.
that
is
not,
of
course,
the
situation
that
occurred
here.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
your
honor,
the
commission
found
both
that
the
boycott
was
unlawful
per
se
and
under
rule
of
reason
analysis,
and
we
think
it
was
correct
on
both
counts.
the...
what
is
per
se
unlawful
is
an
agreement
among
competitors
as
to
the
price
at
which
they
will
deal,
and
that
is
true
whether
the
competitors
number
only
a
few
or
number
here
more
than
a
hundred.
but,
of
course,
one
doesn't
find
typically
that
only
two
or
three
competitors
in
a
market
served
by
one
hundred
will
make
such
an
agreement,
because
it
would
have
no
effect.
and
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
it's
price-fixing
boycott,
your
honor.
it
was
price-fixing
that
was
implemented
by
means
of
a
boycott.
and
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
it
was,
as
it
said,
the
essence
of
price-fixing
and
a
classic
restraint
of
trade
within
the
meaning
of
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
and
this
court
has
never
wavered
in
its
recognition
that
naked
price-fixing
agreements
are
unlawful
per
se,
without
regard
to
whether
the
conspirators
have
market
power.
the
court
of
appeals
also
correctly
recognized
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
immunity
for
such
conduct.
the
noerr
doctrine
establishes
that
competitors
may
associate
together
for
the
purpose
of
attempting
to
persuade
the
legislature
to
enact
legislation,
and
even
though
that
legislation
may
itself
result
in
fixing
prices
or
restricting
output,
that
does
not
convert
the
joint
effort
to
achieve
such
legislation
into
a
contract
in
restraint
of
trade.
but
the
noerr
doctrine
does
not
permit
competitors
to
fix
prices
or
restrict
output
themselves
as
a
means
of
pressuring
the
legislature.
in
the
noerr
case,
the
only
conduct
involved
was
a
joint
publicity
campaign:
the
railroads
conspired
to
run
advertisements.
and
this
court
recognized
that
they
did
not
jointly
give
up
their
trade
freedom
or
otherwise
engage
in
boycotts,
price-fixing
or
agreements
traditionally
condemned
by
section
1
of
the
sherman
act.
the
lawyers
here
did
precisely
that.
although
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
recognized
that
there
is
no
first
amendment
immunity
for
the
boycott
in
this
case,
it
then
reversed
course
and
held
that
if
the
boycott
were
characterized
as
expression,
and
if
one
applied
the
test
in
united
states
v.
o'brien
rather
than
the
test
in
noerr,
that
the
boycott
would
be
entitled
to
constitutional
protection
from
application
of
the
per
se
rule
against
naked
price-fixing
agreements.
we
think
the
court's
application
of
the
o'brien
test
in
this
situation
was
both
incorrect
and
unnecessary.
it
was
unnecessary
because
this
court,
in
the
noerr
doctrine,
has
already
balanced
the
rights
of
competitors
to
act
in
collusion
to
petition
the
legislature
against
the
rights
of
the
public
to
be
protected
from
anti-competitive
restraints
of
trade.
and
the
balance
struck
in
noerr
is
that
competitors
may
jointly
lobby,
but
they
may
not
jointly
fix
prices.
and
to
apply
a
further
o'brien
test
in
this
context
basically
subverts
the
test
established
by
the
court
in
noerr.
even,
however,
if
one
does
apply
the
o'brien
test
here,
it
does
not
result
in
the
conclusion
that
the
sherman
act
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
per
se
prohibition
against
naked
price-fixing
agreements
proceeds
from
the
recognition
that
such
agreements
are
always...
are
almost
always
harmful
to
competition,
and
are
never
helpful
to
it.
and
the
o'brien
test
does
not
prevent
the
government
from
enforcing
categorical
prohibitions
against
generally
harmful
conduct,
merely
because
such
conduct
may
not
be
harmful
in
particular
instances.
as
this
court
said
in
united
states
v.
albertini,
the
first
amendment
does
not
bar
application
of
a
neutral
regulation
that
incidentally
burden
speech
merely
because
a
party
contends
that
allowing
an
exception
in
the
particular
case
will
not
threaten
important
government
interests.
put
another
way,
the
per
se
rule
against
price-fixing
serves
important
values
of
business
certainty
and
litigation
efficiency.
and
those
in
themselves
are
substantial
governmental
interests
that
the
court
is
required
to
consider
in
conducting
an
o'brien
analysis.
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
credit
those
interests
here.
the
respondents
maintain
that
it
is
inappropriate
to
apply
the
per
se
rule
because
of
the
assumption
that
underlies
it,
that
naked
price-fixing
agreements
are
generally
harmful,
does
not
apply
in
the
case
of
such
agreements
directed
at
legislative
targets.
but
i
think
that
the
facts
of
this
case
themselves
demonstrate
the
validity
of
that
assumption,
even
assuming
the
court
felt
it
appropriate
to
reexamine
it
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
as
i
have
said,
the
lawyers
who
engaged
in
this
boycott
comprised
nearly
all
those
who
made
a
practice
at
the
time
of
accepting
criminal
justice
act
assignments.
they
expected
the
boycott
to
have
a
severe
impact
on
the
district's
criminal
justice
system
by
depriving
it
of
the
attorneys
it
needed
to
operate,
and
the
boycott
had
that
effect.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
the
problem,
your
honor,
is
it
was
shown
in
the
court
of
appeals.
this
time,
the
court
said
that
it
was
inadequate
to
demonstrate
the
requisite
power
even
under
rule
of
reason
analysis.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
we're
not
really
certain.
it
said
it
was
not--
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
--it
said
it
was
not
sufficient
to
show
that
the
boycott
had
harmful
effects,
such
as
threatening
a
shut
down
of
the
court
system,
because
those
effects
might
have
resulted
from
the
communicative
impact
of
the
boycott
rather
than
its
coercive
impact.
and
so
therefore
we
must
demonstrate
that
the
cja
lawyers
had
market
power
so
that
we
could,
from
that,
infer
that
the
actual
demonstrated
harmful
effects
were
the
result
of
such
power
rather
than
of
communication.
and
we
find
this
a
rather
baffling
command,
because,
of
course,
the
same
objection
could
be
raised
in
almost
any
case.
this
court
has
said
that,
even
in
a
rule
of
reason
case
where
the
conduct
is
not
per
se
unlawful,
market
power
need
not
be
shown
precisely.
it
is
sufficient
to
demonstrate
that
the
boycott
actually
restrained
trade.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
that
is
correct.
we...
we
did
not
challenge
the
lobbying
effort
that
preceded
the
boycott,
and
the
dividing
line
is
very
clear.
nor
do
we
challenge
the
communicative
activities
that
were
conducted
at
the
same
time
as
the
boycott,
such
as
contacts
with
the
press
and
so
forth.
we
challenge
only
the
collective
refusal
to
supply
services
to
the
city
at
the
price
it
was
offering.
i
think,
for
the
reasons
i
have
indicated,
that
under
a
rule
of
reason
analysis
properly
conceived,
the
conduct
here
could
properly
be
condemned,
and
the
commission
so
held
in
the
alternative
in
its
opinion.
but
i
also
cite
these
facts
to
demonstrate
that
there
is
no
reason
in
this
case
to
revisit
the
sherman
act's...
the
validity
of
the
sherman
act's
per
se
prohibition
against
naked
price-fixing
agreements.
even
when
directed
against
legislatures,
they
are
typically
just
as
harmful
as
when
directed
against
private
parties.
and
we
think
it
is
important
for
the
court
to
reiterate
the
applicability
of
the
per
se
rule
in
the
facts
of
this
case.
it
is
the
oldest
and
clearest
prohibition
in
the
antitrust
laws.
we
think
if
there
is
one
thing
that
most
business
persons
understand,
or
ought
to
understand,
about
their
obligations
under
those
laws,
it
is
that
they
must
decide
for
themselves,
and
not
in
concert
with
their
competitors,
whether
they
will
deal
and
at
what
price
they
will
deal.
and
it
is
obedience
to
that
command
that
ensures
everyone
the
benefits
of
competition,
and
dilution
of
that
command
jeopardizes
those
benefits.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
that
is
basically
what
they
did
before
the
boycott,
your
honor,
and
we
have
not
challenged
that.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
different
lawyers
had
different
requests.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
that
was
the
demand
of
some
lawyers,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
the
final
bill
was
$35.
that
was
the
request
of
other
lawyers.
there
is
a
question,
by
the
way,
as
to
whether,
as
a
general
matter,
competitors,
in
markets
where
sellers
set
the
price,
can
agree
among
themselves
even
on
a
lobbying
price,
because
if
you
allow
such
an
agreement,
then
that
agreed
lobbying
price
may
become
the
price
that
is
established
in
the
market.
but
i
think
in
this
case,
where
the
seller...
the
buyer,
rather,
posted
the
price,
there
is
certainly
no
objection
to
the
sellers
getting
together
and
agreeing
on
a
lobbying
price.
and
we
certainly,
we
have
not
challenged
it
here.
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
the
novel
rule
that
it
was
created
rested
heavily
on
the
peculiar
facts
of
this
case,
but
the
court
did
not
identify
any
facts
that
could
serve
to
distinguish
this
case
in
a
principled
and
legally
significant
way
from
any
others.
if
it
is...
lawyers
permitted
or
given
special
antitrust
consideration
when
they
withhold
their
services
in
an
effort
to
obtain
an
increase
in
the
price,
then
there
is
no
way
to
deny
the
same
treatment
to
doctors
who
would
withhold
their
services
in
an
effort
to
obtain
an
increase
in
state
medicaid
reimbursement
rates,
or
pharmacists
who
would
withhold
their
services
in
an
effort
to
increase
the
rates
for
which
states
reimburse
them
under
prepaid
prescription
plans,
or
a
great
many
other
government
suppliers
who
believe,
as
sincerely
as
the
lawyers
did
in
this
case,
that
the
public
would
benefit
from
increased
expenditures
on
the
particular
good
or
service
that
they
sell.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
your
honor,
the
lawyers
in
this
case
were
not
compelled
to
offer
their
services.
so
the
city
attempted
to
provide
indigent
legal
services
by
utilizing
the
operations
of
the
free
market.
it
offered
a
price
and
asked
those
who
wished
to
do
so
to
sell
it
legal
services
at
that
price.
it
did
not
force
anyone
to
come
in.
now--
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
--your
honor,
i
must
say,
parenthetically,
it
is
not,
it
is
not
clear
to
me
the
extent
of
the
court's
authority
to
order
lawyers
to
report.
i
guess
in
the
mallard
decision
last
year
the
majority
seemed
to
indicate
that
it
is
at
least
an
open
question
as
to
whether
such
compulsion
can
be
exercised.
but
assuming
that
it
could
be,
there
would
nevertheless
be
a
very
substantial
cost
in
this
case
to
the
courts
utilizing
that
extraordinary
power.
in
1974
criminal
justice
act
funds
ran
out
in
the
district,
and
so
it
was
essential
then
to
implement
a
draft.
and
the
record
shows
that
a
large
number
of
attorneys
did
not
respond
and
the
district
bar
commenced
a
lawsuit
against
the
institution
of
the
draft.
that
led
the
late
chief
judge
moultrie,
who
had
been
on
the
court
at
the
time,
to
conclude
that
he
did
not
wish
to
reimpose
a
draft
under
these
circumstances.
this
is
not
a
case
of
just
calling
up
one
lawyer
and
asking
them
to
come
down
for
an
important
case.
this
would
have
involved
compelling
hundreds
of
lawyers
to
accept
the
representation
of
thousands
of
cases.
and
while,
i
am
sure
as
a
theoretical
matter,
the
city
might
have
been
able
to
do
it,
that
would
have
entailed
severe
costs
of
its
own.
and
market
power
is
simply
the
power
to
force
a
buyer
to
pay
more
for
what
it
is
you're
selling,
or
to
incur
other
extraordinary
costs
to
obtain
a
substitute.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
well,
by
definition,
since
the
rate
was
set
by
legislation,
any
increase
in
the
rate
would
be
a
political
act.
but
it
was
the
use
of
economic
power
in
this
case,
it
is
the
use
of
economic
power
to
which
we
are
objecting,
the
power
that
these
lawyers
had,
by
collectively
withholding
their
services,
to
require
the
city
to
pay
more
to
regain
those
services.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
no,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
we
are
simply
asking
that
the
lawyers
not
do
this
again,
whenever
they
decide
that
the
rate
is
inadequate
to
satisfy
their
belief
as
to
what
the
appropriate
rate
should
be.
a
cease
and
desist
order.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
we
are
asking
simply
that
you
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
respects
we
have
indicated--
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
--it
will
just
consider
the
scope
of
the
order.
the
effect
of
reversal
would
be
that
the
commission's
determination
that
a
violation
has
occurred
would
be
affirmed.
and
the
court
of
appeals
would
consider
the
unaddressed
objections
that
the
respondents
have
made
to
the
scope
of
the
order.
this
court's
precedence,
we
think,
already
accord
competing
business
persons,
such
as
respondents,
very
extensive
rights
to
act
in
concert
to
express
their
views
on
matters
of
economic
importance
to
themselves.
adding
the
novel
right
of
expressive
price-fixing,
as
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
here,
comes
at
too
high
a
price
to
the
economic
liberties
guaranteed
all
citizens
by
the
sherman
act.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
there
are
several
grounds
of
distinction,
your
honor.
this
court
said
in
the
allied
tube
case
that
claiborne
was
limited
to
consumers
who
did
not
stand
to
profit
financially
from
a
lessening
of
competition
in
the
boycotted
market.
claiborne
involved
black
consumers
who
withheld
their
patronage
from
white
businesses
in
order
to
achieve
racial
equality.
there
was
no
suggestion
that
they
proceeded
from
parochial
economic
interests.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
which
is
why,
your
honor,
we
think
that
you
meant
what
you
said
when,
in
allied,
that
claiborne
is
limited
to
consumers
who
did
not
stand
to
profit
financially,
because
when
you
face
this
problem
with
the
union
you
didn't--
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
--oh,
excuse
me.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
limited
both
to,
in
our
view,
to
consumers
and
to
those
who
do
not
stand
to
profit
financially
from
a
lessening
of
competition
in
the
boycotted
market.
you
have
neither
condition
satisfied
here,
because
these
are
not
consumers,
and
they
do
stand
to
profit,
quite
substantially,
from
a
lessening
of
competition.
they
were
seeking
a
price
increase
for
themselves.
if
you
don't
apply
that
limitation,
then
claiborne
swallows
up
enormous
portions
of
the
antitrust
laws,
because
most
price-fixers
believe
sincerely
that
benefits
would
accrue
to
consumers
from
spending
more
on
their
product,
and
that
they
could
do
a
better
job
if
more
were
spent.
and
it
is
very
hard
to
distinguish
between
the
motives
of
one
group
and
those
of
another.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
i
won't
use
them
all,
your
honor,
but
there
was
some
discussion
as
to
whether
the
lawyers
competed
here.
they
did
compete,
and
the
commission
and
the
court
of
appeals
both
found
that
they
competed
by
providing
the
same
service
to
a
buyer.
and
that
is
the
only
way
that
businessmen
ever
compete
in
the
antitrust
sense.
the
city
was
not...
the
city
depended
on
their
competition
to
obtain
the
supply
of
lawyers
that
it
required.
the
number
of
assignments
that
a
lawyer
would
receive
each
day
depended
upon
how
many
other
lawyers
called
in
and
volunteered
for
them.
if
not
enough
lawyers
had
called
in
in
the
exercise
of
their
own
independent
judgment,
the
city
could
not
have
obtained
the
supply
it
needed
at
the
price,
and
it
would
have
had
to
raise
the
price
without
a
boycott.
but
that's
not
what
happened.
it
was
only
when
the
boycott
occurred--
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
--yes,
your
honor--
mr.
ernest
j.
isenstadt
--the...
i
think
the
question
here,
your
honor,
is
not
how
much
the
district
ought
to
be
paying
lawyers
under
cja,
it
is
the
process
by
which
those
rates
are
established.
and,
you
know,
in
an
ideal
world
the
district
would
pay
lawyers
far
more
than
it
does
even
now,
but
when
you
pay
lawyers
more
that
leaves
you
less
money
to
spend
on
other
vital
city
services,
and
the
antitrust
laws
are
designed
to
give
the
buyer
the
freedom
to
make
that
choice,
through
the
benefits
of
competition.
and
competition
here
yielded
an
adequate
supply
prior
to
the
boycott
at
the
price
the
city
offered.
the
second
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
reject
our
contention
that
this
was
a
per
se
violation.
it
recognized
that
this
was
a
per
se
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
without
regard
to
whether
there
was
market
power.
but
it
held
that
the
first
amendment,
as
construed
in
o'brien,
made
that
law
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
our
point
is
simply
that
the
per
se
rule
is
based
on
the
assumption
that
price-fixing
is
generally
harmful,
and
the
constitution
doesn't
prohibit
enforcement
of
a
categorical
ban
upon
generally
harmful
conduct
merely
because
it
is
claimed
that
in
a
particular
circumstance
the
harm
is
not
being
caused.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
i
think,
disregarded
that
admonition
in
the
way
it
construed
o'brien.
i
have
no
further
questions.
