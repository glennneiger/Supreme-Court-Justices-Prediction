justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
could
you...
just
a
preliminary
question.
does
the
boycott
have
to
be
somewhat
successful
before
it
is
a
boycott?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
just
three
attorneys
agreed
that
they
would
do
this.
would
that
be
a
boycott,
subject
to
the
per
se
rules?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
reason
i
ask
it,
because
you
do
indicate
that
you
had
looked
to
the
actual
market
effect
of
what
occurred
in
order
to
prove
that
there
was
a
boycott.
