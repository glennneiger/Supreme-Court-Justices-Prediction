mr.
isenstadt,
i
suppose
it
was
perfectly
all
right
for
the
lawyers
to
get
together
and
agree
on
a
price
they
would
request
from
the
city
council,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
asked
for
what?
they
were
getting
$30
an
hour,
and
they
wanted
$55,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
one
of
their
original
demands
for
$55
an
hour
for
court
time
and
$45
for
office
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
did
they
get?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
isenstadt,
in
requesting
relief
in
this
case...
did
the
commission
ask
for
a
roll
back
to
$30?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are
satisfied
with
the
political
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
on
this
no
competition
principle,
what
about
doctors
supplying
services
for
medicaid
or
something
like
that?
are
they
in
competition
with
one
another?
does
the
principle...
the
principle
that
you
are
seeking
us
to
adopt
apply
to
doctors
serving...
providing
services
pursuant
to
a
set
rate
by
the
government?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
a
different
sense
from
the
way
in
which
these
lawyers
are
in
competition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
can
you
say
there
is
no
possibility?
they
had
the
boycott
and
the
price
went
up.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
maybe
it
wasn't
caused
by
it,
but
surely
there
is
a
possibility
there
was
some
causal
connection
between
the
two
events.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
but
what
i'm
just
really
trying
to
find
out,
the
rule
that
you
ask
us
to
adopt
would
apply
to
doctors
serving
the
government
too,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
performing
services
pursuant
to
a
statute
that
authorizes
reimbursement
pursuant
to
fixed
schedules.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
14,000
members
of
the
bar
didn't
storm
into
the
courts
and
take
care
of
the
boycott
when
it
arose,
did
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
were
waiting
in
the
wings
and
they
stayed
in
the
wings.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
we
could
have
bought
airplanes
from
japan,
too,
but...
i
mean,
you've
always
got
a
potential
additional
source
of
supply.
there
is
always
potential
competition
out
there
somewhere.
