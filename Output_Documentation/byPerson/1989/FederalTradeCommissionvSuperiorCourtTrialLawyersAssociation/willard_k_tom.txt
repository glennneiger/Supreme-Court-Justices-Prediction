mr.
willard
k.
tom
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ftc's
central
theme,
i
believe,
is
that
unless
you
adopt
its
flat
per
se
prohibition,
there
will
be
no
principled
way
to
contain
the
consequences.
the
ftc
recognizes
that
this
case
involves
individuals
publicly
seeking
legislation.
it
understands
that
the
lawyers
sought
not
just
private
gain
but
to
further
the
sixth
amendment
interests
of
their
clients,
and
that
respondent
slaight,
one
of
the
leaders
of
the
boycott,
sought
no
private
gain
at
all,
because
she
had
already
decided
to
leave
cja
practice
and
had
stopped
picking
up
new
cases.
it
does
not
deny,
although
it
tries
to
minimize,
the
fact
that
the
superior
court
could
have
exercised
it
appointment
power
to
break
the
strike.
but,
says
the
ftc,
we
must
ignore
all
of
that
and
deem
this
to
be
hardcore
price-fixing,
cartel
behavior,
because
otherwise
there
will
be
no
stopping
point.
with
all
due
respect,
i
submit
the
ftc
is
wrong.
there
are,
in
fact,
a
variety
of
rules
to
resolve
this
case,
each
with
its
own
limiting
principles.
first,
there
is
the
court
of
appeals'
rule
of
reason
test.
there
is
nothing
novel
or
unprincipled
about
a
rule
of
reason
test.
the
rule
of
reason
is
the
standard
mode
of
antitrust
analysis.
it
is
used
for
mergers,
for
vertical
nonprice
restraints,
for
most
joint
venture
problems
and
for
some
types
of
boycotts.
second--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--well,
the
ftc
approaches
the
characterization
of
this
conduct
as...
as
price-fixing
in
a
somewhat
peculiar
fashion.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
your
honor--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--your
honor,
they
did.
they
found
that
this
type
of
boycott
was
price-fixing.
but
in
order
to
do
that,
i
suggest,
they
had
to
take
this
really
in
two
steps,
and
two
steps
that
i
think
are
contrary
to
the
analysis
of
noerr.
first
they
say,
is
this
the
type
of
conduct
that,
assuming
a
private
buyer,
ignoring
the
political
context,
taking
a
purely
commercial
context,
is
this
the
type
of
conduct
that
we
call
price-fixing?
and
the
second
step
is,
well,
if
it
is
price-fixing,
if
it
is
unlawful
under
that
first
step,
then
is
it...
is
reaching
this
conduct,
does
the
political
conduct...
context,
make
reaching
this
conduct
unconstitutional
under
the
first
amendment.
and
i
think
what
is
missing
in
that
analysis
is
any
attention
to
whether
first
amendment
principles
inform
the
interpretation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
the
very
broad
and
general
prescriptions
of
the
sherman
act.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
justice
scalia,
the
noerr
doctrine
is
based
both
in
the
first
amendment
and
in
an
examination
of
the
sherman
act
and
its
legislative
history
and
its
purposes,
and
i
think
it
recognizes
that
there
is
something
special
about
the
legislative
process,
and
that
the
types
of
consequences
that
are
likely
to
flow
from
conduct
directed
at
the
legislature
is
different
from
the
kinds
of
consequences
that
you
see
in
private
commercial
markets.
and
so,
i
think
it
is
not
an
argument
that
is
available
to
everyone
for
every
conduct
in
whatever
context.
and
i
think
one
of
the
reasons
your
decision
in
allied
tube
placed
so
much
emphasis
on
the
context
and
nature
of
the
activity
is
for
that
very
reason.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
your
honor,
under...
there
is
a
rule
which
is
one
that
we
did
not...
that
my
client,
the
association,
did
not
propound,
did
not
urge
on
you
in
the
brief,
that
would
say
that
if
you
have
a
public
boycott
aimed
at
the
legislature,
it
is
by
that
fact
alone
simply
not
within
the
scope
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
i
would
say
it
is
a
potential
rule--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--one
that
could
be
adopted,
and
one
that
could
reasonably
be
adopted
because
it
is
limited
first
by
the
fact
that
congress,
or
any
legislative
body,
could
draw
the
line
in
a
different
place,
that
is,
it
is
a
rule
of
statutory
construction
and
does
not
require
you
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
in
the
first
instance.
and
second,
by
the
fact
that
it
applies
only
to
public
boycotts
directed
at
the
legislature,
that
is
to
conduct
that
has
a
dual
character
to
it:
to
boycott
a
conduct
that
has
been
a
traditional
means
of
expression
but
also
a
conduct
that
the
antitrust
laws
sometimes
reach.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
that...
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
facts
are
entirely
distinguishable.
i
was
simply,
in
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
responding
that
at
least
one
of
the
briefs
in
this
case
has
urged
a
bright-line
rule,
and
that
there
are
limited
principles
even
to
that
bright-line
rule.
but
i...
i
would
also
say
that
one
need
not--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--that
is
right.
and
what
i
would
suggest
is
that
that
inference,
or
that
presumption,
does
not
apply
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
these
lawyers
don't
compete.
they
have
got
the
price
set
by
statute,
and...
and
they
are...
they
are
in
a
position
where
the
council...
the
council
and
the
superior
court
both
really
have
them
entirely
at
their
mercy.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
the
lawyers
call
in
in
the
morning
to
volunteer
for
new
cases,
and
assuming
that
they
are...
at
the
time
of
this
case,
they
would
generally
get
a
case
in
response
to
any
volunteering.
as
a
result
of
the
increase,
there
was
then
an
influx
of
lawyers
into
the
cja
system,
and
the
cases
were
no
longer
automatically
given,
but
were
apportioned
out
by
the
appropriate
officials.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
well,
that
was
about
the
extent
of
the
competition,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
they
are
in
competition
in
a
sense.
they
certainly
are
in
competition
as
to
whether
they
will
offer
their
services
[inaudible]--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--i
think
the
difference,
your
honor,
is
not
so
much
whether
they
were
in
competition
in
a
formal
sense,
but...
whether
the
facts
and
circumstances
here
indicate
any
possibility
of
the
exercise
of
market
power.
in--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--well--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--that
is
right.
and
one
possible
way
to
resolve
this
case
is
to
take
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
and
say
if
market
power
can
be
proven,
then
it
may
be
that
this
strike
was
coercive.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
the
rule--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--the
bright-line
rule
that...
that
i
stated
a
moment
ago,
which
was
urged
on
you
by
the
individual
respondents
in
this
case,
would
include
those...
that
kind
of
hypothetical.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
that
is
true.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is
why
i
think
there
is
a
third
potential
rule--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--and
that
distinction,
i
think,
is
only
one
of
may
distinctions
that
could
be
drawn
here,
which
is
why
the
association
proposed
in
its
brief
a
third
possible
rule:
that
one
could
hold
that
while
lack
of
self
interest
or
lack
of
market
power
should
each
be
sufficient
to
characterize
the
conduct
as
political,
they
should
not
be
the
only
means
of
demonstrating
the
political
context
and
nature
of
the
conduct.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
there
is
no
one
in
competition
with
the
court,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
the...
there
is
no
one
in
competition
with
the
lawyers,
except
in
the
sense--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--that...
there
are...
i...
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
the
last
part
of
the
question.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
in
order
to
get
the
antitrust
laws
involved?
mr.
willard
k.
tom
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
ftc--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--the
ftc's
position
is
that
all
of
the
cja
lawyers
were
in
competition
with
each
other
in
the
sense
that
they
could
decide
or
not
decide
to
offer
their
services.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
your
honor,
i
am
sorry,
i
don't
entirely
understand
the
import
of
your
question.
i
think
our
position--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--i
am
representing
the
lawyers,
your
honor,
the...
people
who
went
on
strike
in
this
case.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
i
confess,
i
don't
fully
understand
why
the
ftc
thinks
that
there
is
the
kind
of
competitive
harm
here
that
calls
the
antitrust
laws
into
play
entirely.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
no,
your
honor.
the...
the
antitrust
laws,
however,
are
directed
at
preventing
the
exercises
of
economic
collusion
on
consumers
in
the
marketplace.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
whether
or
not,
your
honor,
the
lawyers
are
regarded
as
being
in
competition
in
some
form,
i
would
suggest
that
the
principles
of
noerr
and
allied
tube
would
characterize
this
conduct
as
political,
regardless
of
whether
it
is
in
competition
or
not.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
if
i
said
that,
your
honor,
i
misspoke.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
i
think
they
are
separate
points.
and
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
about
market
power
is
that
under
noerr
and
allied
tube
this...
the
courts
or
the
agencies
enforcing
the
antitrust
laws,
have
the
responsibility
of
determining
whether
the
conduct
is
political
or
whether
it
is
commercial.
and
i
would
suggest
that
where
there
is
no
market
power
the
conduct
is
clearly
political,
as
judge...
judge
silberman's
concurrence
suggested.
and
that
one
can
make
that
decision
without
even
reaching
the
constitutional
analysis
offered
by
the
majority
of
[inaudible]--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--no.
what
the
court
of
appeals
below
did
was
to
say
that
if
you
have
market
power...
if
you
do
not
have
market
power,
then
we
have
to
recognize
this
kind
of
conduct,
it
was
public
boycotting
directed
at
the
legislature,
that
kind
of
conduct
has
to
be
recognized
as
political
in
the
absence
of
market
power,
because
it
could
not
have
its
effect
through
economic
coercion.
and
so
it
must
be
political.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
in
effect,
that...
that
is
the
result
of
what
it
did.
the
analysis
took
a
somewhat
different
course
and
relied
on
o'brien
and
on
first--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--your
honor,
i
think
that
would
be
the
appropriate
result
here.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
but
i
don't
think
you
have--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--but
i
don't
think
you
have
to
reach
the
o'brien
analysis
because
this
case
can
be
decided
under
noerr.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
well,
and
yet
trucking
unlimited
said
that
the
legislature
is
unique
and
that
the...
that
even
administrative
bodies
or
courts
are
different
from
legislatures
in
that
regard.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
we
are
urging
noerr
both
as
part
of
our
cross-petition
and
in
response
to
the
ftc's
petition--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--because
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
can
be
affirmed
on
the
basis
of
noerr,
namely
that--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--on
that
point
i
think
it...
i
think
yes.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
was
the
lower
courts
in
noerr
that
had
tried
to
draw
the
distinction
between
pure
speech
and...
and
some
kind
of
speech
plus,
and
this
court
reversed.
one
could
say
that
a...
that
a
deceptive
publicity
campaign
was
more
the
speech
than
conduct,
but
it
is
hard
to
see
why
that
wouldn't
equally
be
true
of
the
boycott
in
this
case
or--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
what
i...
what
i'm
saying
noerr
did
is
to
say
that
you
need
to
distinguish
between
political
conduct
and
commercial
conduct,
and
the
market
power
test
does
give
you
one
way
of
doing
that.
in
our
cross-petition,
we
are
saying
that
that
should
not
be
the
only
way
of
distinguishing
political
from
commercial
conduct.
and
we
do
that
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
would
seem
inconsistent
with
the
spirit
of
allied
tube
itself,
because
in
allied
tube
you
had
highly
self-interested
actors
who
had
gotten
their
hands
on
the
levers
of
the
most
influential
electrical
code
[inaudible]--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--no,
your
honor,
i
am
saying
that...
that
there
was
more
than
self
interest
at
stake,
witness
joanne
slaight,
witness
the
fact
that
any
of
these
lawyers
could
have
raised
their
incomes
individually,
if
you
take
the
alj's
observation
that
the
ones
who
were
close
to
the
ceiling
on
compensation
did
so
by
taking
a
lot
of
simple
misdemeanors
and
pleading
them
out.
and
the
fact
that
most
of
these
lawyers
did
not
do
that,
i
suggest,
shows
that
there
is
more
than
self
interest
at
stake.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
that's
right,
your
honor.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
that
single
point
should
be
dispositive,
or
that
each
individual
point
must
be
examined
in
isolation
and
the
slate
wiped
clean
after
each.
but
i
think
it
is
significant
that
we
had
strong
issues
of
public
concern
that
were
certainly
not
a
sham,
that
you
had
a
debate
that
was
long
ongoing
about
whether
the
sixth
amendment
rights
were
actually
being
adequately
served.
and
these
lawyers...
these
lawyers...
this
lawyers
boycott
should
not
be
viewed
totally
in
isolation
from
that.
when
you
combine
that
with
some
of
the
strong
evidence
of
lack
of
coercion
in
the
case,
such
as
the
courts'
appointment
power,
such
as
the
fact
that
these
lawyers
announced
their
strike
long
in
advance,
giving
the
pds
time
to
adjust
its
caseloads
to
help
alleviate
the
burden,
such
as
the
supportiveness
of
the
ostensible
targets,
i
think
when
you
take
all
those
facts
together
there
is
really
a
strong
indication
that
the
conduct
here
was
political.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
well,
one,
you
do
have
the
sham
exception.
two,
while
the
bright-line
rule
would
require
that
result,
i
don't
think
a
context
and
nature
rule
would
require
similar
treatment
at
all.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
but
what...
what
you
don't
have
in
that
example
is
14,000
members
of
the
d.c.
bar
waiting
in
the
wings
as
potential
competitors.
you
don't
have
the
court's
appointment
power.
you
don't
have
joanne
slaight,
who
didn't
have
any
interest
at
all--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--no,
that's
true.
mr.
willard
k.
tom
that
is
right,
your
honor,
but
they
could
have
been
brought
in
from
the
wings
by
the
[inaudible]--
mr.
willard
k.
tom
--well,
there
is...
there
is
always
a
certain
degree
of
line
drawing,
and
allied
tube
itself
this
court
recognized
was
a
very
close
case.
unless
you
adopt
a
bright-line
rule,
and
i
think
there
are
some
advantages
to
the
bright-line
rule
that
the
individual
respondents
urge,
then
you
are
going
to
be
faced
with
close
cases.
i
don't
think
this
was
a
close
case.
this
is
one
where
the
circumstances
all
clearly
point
very
strongly
in
the
direction
of
highly
political
conduct.
let
me
add
one
more
point,
that
is
the
ftc's
rule
itself
does
not
offer
much
of
a
stopping
point
in
the
other
direction.
it
would
proscribe
all
expressive
boycotts
against
the
government,
so
long
as
the
participants
can
be
said
to
be
in
competition
with
one
another.
it
would
have
condemned
the
lawyers
strike
even
if
it
had
lasted
two
days
and
consisted
of
only
the
four
individual
respondents.
it
would
condemn
the
dairy
farmers
who
pour
their
milk
down
the
drain
to
get
their
protests
on
the
evening
news.
and
indeed,
since
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
buyers
as
well
as
sellers
can
be
competitors
for
antitrust
purposes,
the
boycotters
in
claiborne
hardware
would
have
been
condemned
per
se
if
one
of
their
claims
had
been
that
the
white
merchants
were
price
gouging
them.
in
fact,
since
those
boycotters
opened
a
retail
store
in
competition
with
the
white
merchants,
perhaps
the
ftc's
rule
would
condemn
them
even
without
changing
the
facts.

mr.
willard

tom
--i
think
it
might
have
been
unimaginable
to
senator
sherman,
and
certainly
i
think,
given
the
fact
that
you
have
a
choice,
you
have
a
statute
that
has
very
broad
and
general
commands,
we
ought
to
construe
it
with
sensitivity
to
the
first
amendment
and...
and
let
congress,
if
it
really
wants
to
reach
that
conduct,
to
say
so
explicitly.
let
me
just
say
one
other
thing
about
the
cost
of
the
court
of
appeals'
approach.
remember,
the
court
of
appeals
said
if
you
have
no
self-interest,
you
are
okay
under
claiborne;
if
you
have
no
market
power
then
you
are
okay
under
o'brien.
but
if
there
are
cases,
and
i
believe
this
is
one,
in
which
the
totality
of
the
circumstances
clearly
point
in
the
direction
of
political
conduct
before
even
reaching
a
formal
market
power
inquiry,
then
a
gratuitous
requirement
of
such
an
inquiry
not
only
wastes
judicial
resources
but
also
imposes
an
unnecessary
burden
on
the
speech
and
petitioning
of
those
who
can
afford
it
least.
after
all,
it
is
individuals,
particularly
the
poor
and
disenfranchised,
who
are
most
likely
to
need
to
resort
to
conduct
like
a
boycott.
and
it
is
also
individuals
who
are
going
to
be
least
in
a
position
to
offer
a
market
power
defense
and
to
be
able
to
afford
the
kind
of
inquiry
that
would
be
necessary.
and
i
suggest
that
nothing
in
the
antitrust
laws
requires
that
result.
your
honors,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i--
