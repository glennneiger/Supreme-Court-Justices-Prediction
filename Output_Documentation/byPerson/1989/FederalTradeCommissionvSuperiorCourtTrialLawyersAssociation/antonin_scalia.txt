justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
do
with
claiborne
hardware?
how...
how
does
the
commission
explain...
explain
that
consistently
with
its
position
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
as...
as
judge
silberman
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion,
you
could
have
said
the
same
in
the,
in
international
longshoremen's
association
case,
where
we
did
not
allow
the
boycott,
despite
the
political
motivation
and
not
the
economic.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
i
didn't
understand
how
you
said
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean,
it
is
limited
to
consumers,
who
did
not
stand
to
profit
financially,
not
limited
to
consumers
who
did
not
stand
to
profit
financially.
[laughter]
is
that
the
point
you
are
making?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
tom,
if
we
take
that
approach,
your...
brief
suggests
that,
you
know,
it
can
sort
of
be
limited
to
these
situations
where
the
government
is
somehow
the
objective,
or
the
object
of
the
activity,
so
that
it
has
a
noerr
coloration
to
it.
but
in
fact,
the
first
amendment
contains
not
only
the
right
to
petition
the
government
for
address
of
grievances,
but
also
the
right
to
communicate
to
other
people
as
well.
so
why
couldn't
any
group
that...
that
has
a
price-motivated
boycott
against
a
private
concern
make
the
same
argument:
the
only
way
we
can
get
public
attention,
the
only
way
we
can
really
make
our
point
in
the
press,
is
to
have
the
kind
of
restriction
of
business
that
attracts
national
press
attention,
like
the
coalers'
strike,
or
something
like
that?
why
couldn't
you
make
the
same
argument
in
every
case
where
a
group
even...
even
goes
after
a
private
employer,
or
a
private
buyer
of
services?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
makes
two
of
us.
mr.
tom,
i
must
say
i
don't
understand
this
discussion
at
all.
you...
you
seem
to
be
equating
competition
with
market
power,
and
you
seem
to
be
saying
if
there
is
no
market
power,
there
is
no
competition.
that
is
not
true.
i
mean,
the
classic
violation
of
the...
of
the
common
law
was
conspiracy
of
workmen
to
fix
their
wages.
very
often
they
in
fact
had
very
little
economic
power.
here
was,
you
know,
here
was
the
job.
you
take
it
at
this
price
or...
or
leave
it.
and
it
was
never
thought
that
simply
because
there
was
not,
you
know,
real
competition
in
the
sense
that
you
are
saying
it,
that
somehow
the
antitrust
laws
didn't
apply.
is
that
what
you're
asserting?
that
there
has
to
be
market
power
before...
before
the...
it's
the
kind
of
a
situation
that
the
antitrust
law
even
applies
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
be,
but...
but
it
regards
people
as
being
in
competition
with
one
another,
and
proper
subjects
for
application
of
the
common
law,
whether
or
not
they
effectively
can
compete.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
i
am
saying
is,
you...
you
have
been
talking
about
whether
they
are
in
competition
as
equating
that
with
whether
they
have
market
power.
and
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
the
two,
that
the
two--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
what
i...
that
is
how
i
thought
this
discussion
was
going.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
tom,
under...
i
don't
see
why,
under
o'brien,
it
isn't
equally
attractive
to
say
if
you
have
a
people,
a
group
of
people
who
have
no
market
power
staging
a
buying
or
a
selling
boycott
against
a
particular
private
company,
just
to
get
press
attention,
that
that
should
be
immune
from
the
normal
per
se
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
just
the
government,
but
any
private
company.
all
you
have
to
do
is
say,
well,
we
didn't
really
have
market
power.
we're
just
trying
to
get
press
attention.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
suppose,
but
the
principle,
the
principle
you
are
asking
us
to
buy
into
is
as
applicable
to
the...
to
the
first
amendment
expression
of
objection
to
what
a
private
individual
is
doing
as
it
is
to
the
first
amendment
expression
of
the
right
to
petition
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
boeing
and
lockheed
and
all
the
airplane
manufacturers
simply
say
we're
not
going
to
make
anything
more
for
the
government
because
we
don't
think
the
government
is
buying
enough
planes.
this
country
is
in
dire
danger;
we
need
to
beef
up
the
air
force
a
lot,
and
we
are
not
going
to
sell
you
any
planes
unless
you
buy
a
whole
lot
more
than
you
have
been
buying.
now,
that
is
certainly
a
public
issue,
i
mean,
there
are
many
people
think
we
need
more
planes,
or,
you
know,
more...
bigger
defense
establishment
in
general.
that
converts
a
commercial
thing
into
a
public
spectacle.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
not?
i
mean,
you've
got
the
same,
you've
certainly
got
an
important
political
issue
there.
you've
got
to
have
adequate
defense,
and
these
airplane
companies
aren't
making
enough
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they're
not
producing
enough
planes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
is
that
so
horrible,
that
claiborne
would
have
come
out
differently
if...
if
a
substantial
motivation
in
the
boycott
was
to
get
lower
prices?
you...
you...
that
is
unimaginable
to
you,
that
it
should
come
out
differently?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that
was
the
whole
basis.
