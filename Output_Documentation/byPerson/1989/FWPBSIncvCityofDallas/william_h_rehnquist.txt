calvin

v.

mr.
weston.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
these...
these
people
are
not,
strictly
speaking,
engaged
in
speech.
they
are
selling
stuff,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i
am
not
suggesting
the...
the
exchange
of
something
for
the
performance
makes
it
anything
less
than
speech,
but
these...
these
people
are
engaged
in
a
commercial
business.
can't...
can't
a
state
require
a
license
of
these
people
the
same
way
it
requires
the
licensing
of
other
people,
for
purposes
of
collecting
a
sales
tax--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
why...
why
is
it
a
prior
restraint?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
requiring
a
permit
for
a
parade,
then,
is
a
prior
restraint?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
would
that
fit
in
here?
i
mean,
in
those
cases
it
was
a
question
of
some...
something
being
banned
by
a
sensor,
as
i
recall.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let's...
let's
take
free...
didn't
you
also
mention
freedman?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
would
you...
you
say
you
are
entitled
to
a
quick
hearing,
in
effect,
on
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so...
so
what
would
you
be
arguing,
supposing
the
city
turns
down
the
license,
that
you
qualified
under
the
terms
of...
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that...
is
that
what
riley
held,
that
you
had
an,
a...
a
right
to
appeal,
whether
or
not
you
qualified
under
the
state
law?
i...
i
didn't
read
it
that
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
you
may
sell
these
things.
you
know,
call
it
speak
if
you
want,
but
this...
the
owner
of
these
stores
isn't
speaking.
he's
selling
books.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what...
what
if
a
city
has
an
ordinance
that
simply
says
in
order
to
do
business
you've
to
show
you
have
got
a
sales
tax
certificate,
you
are
going
to
pay
your
sales
tax,
you
have
to
have
a...
a
zoning
certificate
to
show
your
business
in
compliance
with
the
zoning.
and
it
applies
that
across
the
board
to
everybody,
including
bookstores.
now,
do
bookstores
but
nobody
else
have
a
right
to
a
quick
hearing
on
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you...
you
can
answer
that
yes
or
no,
can't
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
bookstores
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
on
earth...
what
on
earth
is
the
cost
of
not
doing
so?
why
shouldn't
a
proprietor
of
a
bookstore
be
held
to
the
same
zoning
requirements
and
sales
tax
requirements
as
everybody
else?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
why
does
the
constitution
require
a
special
deal
for
the
bookstore
owner?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
no
case
from
this
court
that
comes
anywhere
close
to
supporting
what
you
are
saying.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that...
that
a
bookstore,
subjected
to
a
general
license
requirement
like
everybody
else
to
show
that
it
is
in
compliance
with
a
zoning
ordinance,
is
entitled
to
a
special
hearing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
isn't...
what...
what
is
your
closest
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
tell
me
what
the
case
most
closely
supporting
that
position
is?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
answer
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you
have
answered
the
question,
mr.
weston.
your
time
has
expired.
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
content
of
the
material
that
is
sold,
because
it
has...
it
is
limited
to
sexually
explicit
material,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mrs.
muncy,
were
there
any
of
the
bookstore
plaintiffs
in
this
action
correspond
to
justice
scalia's
hypothetical,
like
barnes
and
noble--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mrs.
muncy.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
