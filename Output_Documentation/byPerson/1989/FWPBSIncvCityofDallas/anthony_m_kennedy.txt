justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
do
you
take
it,
take
the
position
that
the
requirement
for
the
license
be
denied
for
one
who
has
been
previously
convicted
of
a
crime
as
an
independent
basis
for
striking
either
that
provision
or
the
whole
ordinance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
question
is
to
those,
i
take
it
that
a
court,
in
sentencing,
could
impose
these
as
a
condition
of
parole,
could
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
probation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
why
can't
the
city
exercise
that
same
power
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
the
prohibition
is...
the
same
in
either
case,
and...
and
the
court
is
certainly
bound
by
the
first
amendment
just
as
the
city
council
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're...
you're
avoiding
the
hypothetical
though.
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
this
hasn't
been
challenged
beyond
the
authority
of
the
city
to
do
it.
let's
assume
the
legislature
passed
the
law,
in
order
to
answer
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
the
spouse
of
the
licensee
can
be
convicted
of
one
of
these
crimes
and
that
disqualifies
the
licensee,
does
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
other
point.
if
someone
is
living
or
residing
with
the
licensee
and
that
person
is
convicted
of
one
of
the
specified
offenses,
is
that
not
grounds
for
denying
the
license?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
only...
the
only
nonspousal
disabilities
are
for
persons
who
are
residing
with
the
applicant,
if
those
persons
themselves
have
been
denied
a
license.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
don't
have
cases
which
say
that
a
licensing
procedure
can
be
imposed
on
the
press
or
the
media
on
the
grounds
that
other
segments
of
the
press
or
the
media
can
promulgate
the
same
message,
do
we?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you...
you
are
asking
us
really
to
strike
out
on...
on
very
new
ground
on
that
argument,
are
you
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
i'm
saying
is
that
that
is
a
new
argument
for
which
you
have
no
precedent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--was
there
a
finding
of
fact
on
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
was
a
facial
challenge
to
the
ordinance?
