justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
accept
a
grudging
rejection?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
obscene
speech?
is
that
a...
is
that
a
separate
category?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can
call
it
not
speech,
but
it's
speech,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
let's
not
play
games.
we
have
established
a
separate
category
of
speech,
obscene
speech,
to
which
we
accord
no
protection,
zero.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
if
we
can
say
that
there
is
a
separate
category
of
speech
which
is
not
speech,
as
we
have
done
in
obscenity,
i
suppose
we
could
say
there
is
a
separate
category
of
speech
which
is
only
partly
protected
speech,
as
we
have
already
done
in
commercial
speech.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
indeed
haven't
we
done
that
with
respect
to
pornography,
something
just
short
of
obscenity.
haven't
we
permitted
certain
restrictions
upon
that
that
are
not
permissible
with
respect
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
strictly
speaking,
material
doesn't
come
within
the
ordinance.
the
ordinance
does
not
ban
any
material
whatever.
it
just
says
that
if
a
person
is
engaged
in
a
business,
a
primary
purpose
of
which,
a
primary
purpose
of
which
is
the
sale
of
such
material,
he
needs
to
comply
with
the
licensing.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wait.
what
kind
of
plaintiffs
do
we
have
here?
do
we
have
arcade
plaintiffs--
justice
antonin
scalia
--do
these
plaintiffs
include
all
of
the
kinds
of
businesses
covered
by
the
ordinance?
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is...
is
it
your
position
that
if
the
ordinance
is
bad
with
respect
to
arcades,
it's...
it
has
to
be
bad
with
respect
to
bookstores
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so
then
respond
to
the
point
i
made
regarding
bookstores.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
the
case
that
no
material
is...
is...
prevented
from
being
sold.
justice
antonin
scalia
actually
you
don't
have
to
do
other
speech
in
order
to
fall
out
of
the
a
primary
purpose
of
which.
you
could
sell
shoe
shines
and
chewing
gum,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
sell,
the
state
in
order...
in
order
for
you
to
avoid
the
licensing
scheme,
the
state
is
not
requiring
you
to...
to
promulgate
other
speech,
so
long
as
you
have
other
business
which
makes
the
sale
of
the
sexually
explicit
material
not
a
primary
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
mean
that
every
bookstore,
i
think
this
is
the
point,
do
you
mean
that
every
bookstore
cannot
be
subjected
to
normal
licensing
requirements,
but
you
have
to
have
a...
a
special
accelerated
provision
for
the
licensing
of
that
type
of
business
that
engages
in
expression.
bookstores,
i
suppose,
stores...
i
don't
know,
stores
that
tell...
sell
television
sets,
they
cannot
be
subjected
to
normal
business
licensing,
which
don't
have
time
limits
on...
on
when
the
city
council
must
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
leave
out...
sorry
about
that,
i
went
too
far.
forget
television
sets,
just...
just...
just
bookstores.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
the
practice
in...
in
communities
throughout
the
country,
that
there
are
special
licensing
provisions
for
bookstores?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
about
a
convenience
store
that
sells
newspapers
and
magazines?
are
they...
they
entitled
to
a
special
accelerated
hearing,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
a
supermarket
that,
you
know,
sells--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
a
constitutional
principle,
that
if...
if
you
sell
nothing
but
newspapers
you
are
entitled
to
an
accelerated
hearing,
but
if
you
sell
newspapers
and
bubble
gum
or,
you
know,
a
lot
of
other
things
in
a
convenience
store,
you
are
not?
that's
a
constitutional
principle?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
still
don't
see...
i
still
don't
see
why
a
court
can
do
it
but
the
legislature
can't.
the
court
says
instead
of
giving
you
ten
years
i
am
going
to
give
you
five
years
and
a
probationary
period
during
which
you
can't
sell
this
kind...
this
kind
of
material.
why
can't
a
legislature
say
the
same
thing:
well,
we
were
going
to
make
it
ten
years
for
obscenity,
but
instead
we'll
make
it
only
five
years
and
for
the
next,
and
permanently
you
can't
go
into
the
obscenity
business
afterwards,
or
the
pornography
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
mrs.
muncy,
do
we
have
somebody
who
has
standing
to
challenge
this
particular
provision
of
the
ordinance?
you
say
we
have
people
who
have
been
convicted.
have...
have
they
been
convicted
on
the
basis
of
being
somebody's
brother
or
sister,
or
live-in,
noncommon
law
spouse?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
maybe
that
provision
is
not
before
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
explanation
is
quite
apparent.
its
purpose
is
to
prevent
the
evasion
of
the
provision
by
simply
when
you
are
denied
a...
a
license,
getting
it
granted
to
someone
else
who
is
closely
related
to
you,
and
you
are
the
actual
person
running
the
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
mrs.
muncy,
what
is
it
take
to
establish
that
a
principal
purpose
of
the
business
is
the
sale
of...
of...
these...
these
materials
portraying
sexual
acts?
is...
suppose
i
run
a
general
bookstore
and
my
overall
purpose
is
to
sell
books,
and
it
turns
out
that
a
substantial
portion
of
the
books,
i
don't
know
what
you
want
to
consider
a
substantial
portion,
but
a
substantial
portion
does
contain
either
pictures
or
verbal
descriptions
of
sexual
activities
that...
that
come
under
the
ordinance.
could
it
be
said
on
that
basis
that
i
have
as
a
principal
purpose
of
that
business,
or
do
i
have
to
have
explicitly
in
mind
when
i
go
into
the
business...
business,
i
am
going
to
run
a
porno
shop.
i...
i
want
to
have
either
a
whole
shop
that
is
devoted
to
pornography,
or
i
am
going
to
have
a,
you
know,
a
section
of
the
store
devoted
to
it.
which,
is
there
some
scienter
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
sounds
like
a
sienter
requirement.
i
mean,
that...
that
seems
to
me
to
be
direct...
directed
precisely
at
what
i
asked
you
was
a
purpose
and
you
said
it
wasn't.
you...
you...
you
seem
to
be...
to
be
saying
the
person
must
want
to
sell
sexual
material,
that
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
right,
well,
let's
assume
barnes
and
noble's
is
running
a
bookstore
in
dallas
and
10
percent
of
its
books
contain
description
of
sexual
acts
that
come
under
the
ordinance,
which
might
not
surprise
me,
and
only
one
of
those
books
has
no
literary
or
artistic
value.
that's
all
it
would
take,
right,
if
one
book--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
ten
percent
of
the
books
contain
description
of
sexual
acts--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
all
of
them
except
one
book
have
literary
value.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
would
come
within
the
ordinance,
wouldn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
an
exception
for
literary--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
there
isn't.
the...
the
exception
says
it
is
a
defense
if
every
book
has--
justice
antonin
scalia
--each
book
has
literary
or
artistic
value.
that
is
quite
different.
so
if
barnes
and
noble's
happens
to
sell
one
book
that
has
no
literary
value,
and
sells
10
percent
of
its
overall
sales
of,
you
know,
ulysses
and
other
books
that
describe
sexual
acts,
barnes
and
noble
is
under
the
ordinance
then,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
no,
they
are
not
exempt.
they
are
not
exempt.
you...
you
just
acknowledged
that
the
exception
applies
only
if
every--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
know
i
hope
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
how
it
reads.
now...
now,
if
you
are
telling
me
that
is
how
it
is
interpreted,
it
will
make
it
a
lot
easier
case.
but
that
is
certainly
not
the
way
it
reads.
the...
do
you
have
the
exception
handy?
i
forget
what...
i
forget
what
section
it
is,
but
it
says
it
shall
be
a
defense
to
any
prosecution
that
each...
each
of,
each
item
of
the
sexually
explicit
material
has
literary
value.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
business
purpose
has
to
be
a
purpose
to
sell
sexually
explicit
material,
which
is
simply
defined
as
material
that
describes
these
sexual
acts,
whether
it
has
literary
value
or
not.
so,
if
you
have
as
a
business
purpose
selling
this
stuff,
whether
it
has
literary
value
or
not,
you
have
the...
the
offending
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
have
to
issue
it
in
30
days
unless
there
has
already
been
obtained
the
certain
other
permissions...
fire
and...
and
other--
justice
antonin
scalia
--permission
from
other
city's
authorities
that
are
needed,
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
if
that
is
bad
anyway
it
is
bad
because
the
fire
licensing
ordinance
is
bad.
that
is
to
say,
even
without
this
ordinance,
if
you
didn't
issue
a
fire
permit
to
a...
to
a
bookstore
within...
within
a
specified
period
you
would
be
in
violation
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
special
provisions
for
bookstores?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
if
any
texas
cities
do?
