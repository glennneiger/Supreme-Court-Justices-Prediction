justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
about
commercial
speech.
do
you
think
that
gets
the
same
protection
as
political
speech?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
our
cases
would
support
the
position
that
they
are
entitled
to
the
same
protection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
there
is
some
hierarchy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
is
not
correct;
just
a
different
burden
when
it
is
against
a
public
figure
and
that
sort
of
thing.
there
are
different
rules
applied
to
defamatory
speech
is
a
form
of
speech.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
we're
talking
about
speech
that
you
would
only
say
has
been
entitled
to
less
protection
if
one
can
so
conclude
after
determining
it
was
sexually
oriented
speech.
you
make
that
determination
before
you
say
it
gets
less
protection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
leave
that,
would
you
refresh
my
recollection.
does
this
just
prevent
the
licensee
himself,
i
mean
disqualify
the
licensee
himself
if
he
has
a
prior
conviction,
or
does
it
also
prohibit
him
from
employing
people
who
have
prior
convictions?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
the
licensee.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
you...
i...
i...
i
didn't
quite
realize
what
justice
kennedy
just
pointed
out.
does
this
mean
that
if
somebody,
say
in
a
family,
one
member
of
the
family,
worked
in
a
bookstore
and
got
sometimes
convicted
of
selling
one
obscene
magazine,
then
everybody
who
lives
in
that
family
could
be
disqualified
from...
in
that
home,
would
be
disqualified
from
getting
a
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
person
has
to
have
been
operating
a
business
at
the
time
of
the
conviction.
is
that
what
you
are
saying?
in
other
words,
say
just
before
the
ordinance
was
passed,
mr.
x...
mrs.
x
was
convicted
of
selling
obscene
magazines,
working
in
a
store.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
if
they
were
not
married,
if
he
just
lived
with
ms.
x
and
she
was
convicted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
it's
not
a
common
law
marriage.
i
want
to
get
away
from
the
marriage.
they
just
live
together,
and
therefore
he's
barred
under
the
ordinance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how...
how
can
you
justify
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
couldn't
one
say
it
is
wholly
arbitrary
if
you
have
those
facts.
i
mean,
the
ordinance
isn't
intended
to
make
people
break
up
their
social
relationships,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
to
that
extent
you
are
conceding,
i
think,
the
ordinance
is
over
broad.
maybe
it's
not
very
important--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
if
they
are
brother
and
sister?
does
it
still
apply?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
if
the
sister
is
convicted
of
something,
the
brother
cannot
get
a
license?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
the
facts
are
just
the
opposite?
it
was
an
isolated
incident.
the
woman
worked
for
a
convenience
store
that
sold
one
obscene
magazine;
she
happened
to
get
convicted.
that
disqualifies
her
brother.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
disqualifies
her
brother,
i
suppose
it
disqualifies
her
father,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
live
in
the
same
home.
and
then
i
don't
understand
the
justification
for
that.
i
think
you
have
said
there
is
none,
i
think
that's
it.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
assuming
there
never
was
an
operator
before.
this
is
a
brand
new
license.
the
father
or
the
brother
applies
for
it,
and
a
member
of
the
family...
household,
has
previously
been
convicted
of
one
offense
involving
the
sale
of
one
obscene
magazine.
and
that
disqualifies
the
whole
household.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
about
the
findings
that
the
city
made
to
justify
the
ordinance?
you
said
there
was
an
increase
of
crime
in
the
areas
where
these
business
take
place.
does
that
mean
there
was
an
increase
in
sex-related
crime,
or
in
all
kinds
of
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
more
robberies
and...
and
things
of
that
kind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
they
don't
disqualify
people
for
having
been
prior
felons,
other
than
just...
disqualification
is
only
for
prior
sexually
related
crime.
