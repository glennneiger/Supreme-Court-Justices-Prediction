ms.
analeslie
muncy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
while
the
petitioners
have
raised
a
myriad
of
issues,
i
believe
the
critical
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
city
has
a
justification
for
the
licensing
provisions
in
the
ordinance
that
is
unrelated
to
the...
to
the
suppression
of
speech,
and
whether
these
provisions
are
substantially
broader
than
necessary
to
achieve
the
city's
purpose.
it
is
clear
from
the
circumstances
that
led
to
the
adoption
of
the
ordinance
that
the
city
has
ample
justification
for
these
provisions.
in
1985
and
1986
the
city
of
dallas
was
experiencing
a
proliferation
of
sexually
oriented
businesses
in
the
city,
as
were
many
other
large
urban
areas.
they
were
beginning
to
cluster
in
some
areas
and
then
they
were
beginning
to
open
up
in
small
neighborhood
shopping
centers.
so
the
city
council
determined
that
it
should
investigate
the
effects
of
these
businesses,
and
did
so
by
looking
at
studies
from
other
cities.
it...
it
became
evidence
from
these
studies
that
there
are
serious
problems
of
crime
and
urban
blight
associated
with
sexually
oriented
businesses.
the
city...
the
city
staff
collected
studies
from
nine
cities,
including
los
angeles,
phoenix,
st.
paul
and
austin,
texas.
each
of
these
studies
was
consistent
in
their
findings
that
these
businesses
foster
higher
crime
rates
and
lower
property
values
in
the
areas
where
they
are
located.
secondly,
the
city
council
looked
at
dallas
itself.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
the
studies
looked
at
both
areas,
where
there
were
concentrations
of
those
types
of
businesses,
and
they
looked
at
areas
where
maybe
there
was
only
one
located,
and
i
refer
especially
to
the
study
from
the
city
of
austin
which
looked
at
both--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--that
is
correct.
this
ordinance
created
location
requirements
for
sexually
oriented
businesses,
and
this
court
did
not
accept
any
of
the
questions
on
that--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--yes,
but
we
do
have--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--no,
the
studies
did
not
address
that,
only--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--they
were--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--yes.
they
were
initiated
to
justify
zoning,
but
they
approached
the
crime
that
is
generated
by
the
businesses.
in
addition,
the
city
council
looked
at
what
was
happening
in
dallas
and
did
studies
around,
or
did
a
study
around
an
area
in
dallas
where
there
were
a
number
of
these
businesses.
and
we
do...
while
they
are
not
in
the
joint
appendix,
there
are
exhibits
in
the
record
that
describe
what
was
happening
in
dallas,
and
particularly
an
affidavit
from
a
dallas
police
officer
that
describes
graphically
what
actually
goes
on
in
these
businesses.
and
if
you
are
interested
in
looking,
those
are
defendant's
exhibits
number
19,
20,
21,
22,
and
23.
the
city
council
then
decided
to
regulate
the...
the
businesses
and
enacted
the
ordinance
which
is...
which
under
attack
here
today.
now,
the
question
is,
is
there
any
constitutional
problem
with
what
they
did.
while
the
petitioners
have
attacked
almost
every
provision
in
the
ordinance,
as
best
i
can
tell,
there
are...
there
are
primarily
two
matters
that
are
at
issue.
number
one,
whether
persons
convicted
of
certain
crimes
can
be
disqualified
from
operating
sexually
oriented
businesses
for
a
temporary
period
of
time.
and
secondly,--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--we
did
not
raise
the
question
of
standing
at
this
level.
we
looked
at
the
cases
on
standing
and
it
seemed
to
us
that
we
would
not
have
a
chance
of
prevailing
on
that
issue,
and
we
did
not
raise
it
at
this
level,
although
we
did
raise
it
at
the
lower
levels.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
i
believe
that
there
are
one
or
two
of
the
petitioners
that
have
had
their
licenses
denied
based
on
criminal
conviction.
in
that...
in
that
case
i
would
have
standing.
the
second
issue
that
i
think
is
of
some--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--no,
just
the
licensee.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
yes,
the
person
operating--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--yes,
it
does.
the
second
issue
that
i
think--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--yes,
it
is.
but
the
second
issue
that
the
petitioners
have
discussed
most
frequently
is
the,
is
whether
the
freedman
procedural
safeguards
apply
to
the
licensing
portion
of
the
ordinance.
in
response
to
the
issue
on--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--no.
what
it
means
is
that
if
a
person
is,
owns
or
operates
or
is
the
applicant
or
licensee
for
a
sexually
oriented
business
is
convicted
of
one
of
the
offenses
that
disqualifies,
then
that
person's
spouse
or
a
person
residing
with
that
person
cannot
become
the
applicant
or
the
licensee
for
that...
for
that
business,
or
for
a
similar
sexually
oriented
business
in
the
city.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
then
mr.
x
would
not
be
able
to
obtain
a
sexually
oriented
business
license.
and
the
basis
for
that
is
that
under
texas
community
property
law
both
marriage
partners
have
the
same
interest...
financial
interest,
in
the
business
as
the
other.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
you
have
hit
on
the
basis
for
that
provision
being
in
the
ordinance.
at
least
in
texas,
common
law
marriages
are
quite
prevalent,
and
that
is
the
reason
for
having
that--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--that
is
correct.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
as
i
said,
the...
the
base
for
including
that
provision
in
the
ordinance
is
the
prevalence
of
common
law
marriages
in
texas.
and
so,
i
suppose
if
they
are
not
married
and
it
is
not
a
common
law
marriage,
it's
easy
enough
to
move
to
a
different
apartment,
if
that
is
what
it
takes
to
get
their
license.
but--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--no,
it
is
not.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
well,
i
won't
concede
that
it
is
over
broad.
the...
i
think
there
are
remedies
for...
for
the
person
who
is
living
with
another
one,
but
i...
i...
the
best
representation
i
can
make
to
you
about
those
two
provisions
is
they
are
to
get
at
the
marriage
situation.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
it
still
applies,
and
in
that
case--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--in
that
case
i
think
our...
our
argument
would
be
that
the
close
family
relationship
really
means
that
the
person
who...
who
will
continue
to
operate
the
business
is
probably
the
one
that
had
the
conviction
in
the
first
place.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
that
disqualifies
him
if
they
are
living
together,
from
operating
a
sexually
oriented
business.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
if
they
are
living
together.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
the
best
justification
i
can
give
is
that
the
intimate
relationship
that
they
have
from
living
together
probably
indicates
that
in
the
operation
of
the
business,
we'll
have
the
same
operator
that
we
had
before
the
new
license
was
issued.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
i
understand
your
question.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
to
my
knowledge,
none
of
the
petitioners
has
been
disqualified
on
the
basis
of
either
of
those
provisions.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
it
is
possible.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
i
would...
yes,
he
would,
but
that
is
certainly
not--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--that
is
correct.
that
person--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--that
is
correct,
that
is
exactly
correct.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
yes,
thank
you.
but--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--that
is
exactly
the
purpose
of
the
provision,
yes.
but,
getting
to
the
individual
whose
license
is
denied
or
revoked
because
of
a
criminal
provision,
the
first
point
i
want
to
make
on
that
is
that
the
first
amendment
rights
of
consumers
is
in
no
way...
no
way
affected
by
that
provision.
these
people
are...
intermediaries
who
are
purveying
the
messages
of
others.
and
if
one
individual
has
a
license
denied,
there
will
be
another
to
step
in
and
take
his
place
to
operate
that
business.
because,
as
the
petitioners
pointed
out
in
their
brief
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
competition
for
locations
under
the
location
restriction
is
going
to
be
fierce.
and
again,
the
distributors,
the
national
distributors
of
this
material
which
are
represented
by
the
attorneys
here
today,
have
a
vested
interest
in
making
sure
that
the
number
of
outlets
of
these
do
not
diminish.
and
what
we
hope
is
that
the
result
of
this
provision
will
make
sure
that
these
national
companies
that
distribute
this
material
will
be
motivated
to
find
responsible
people
to
operate
the
businesses
that
service
their
local
outlets.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
no.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
all
i...
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
availability
will
not
be
diminished.
the
first
amendment
rights--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--the
question
of
availability
was
referred
to
in--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--in
justice
powell's
concurring
opinion
in
young.
and
i...
he...
he
made
quite
a
bit
of
that,
and
expressed
the
importance
of
availability
of
the
material
to
the
customers
that...
that
seek...
that
seek
it,
to
read
it.
the
second
point
that
i
want
to
make
is
that
the
only
conceivable
first
amendment
interest
that
i
think
one
can
really
be
concerned
about
is
that
of
the
individual
whose
license
is
denied.
and
we
contend
that
this
is
an
attenuated
first
amendment
interest
at
best
because
it
has
absolutely
nothing
to
do
with
the
content
of
the
material
that
is
being
sold
in
the...
inside
the
establishment
or
its
creation.
it
solely
relates
to
the
running
of
a
commercial
business.
now,
we're
not
saying
that
these--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
this
ordinance
is
content
neutral
under
the
analysis
in
the
renton
case,
and
the
disqualification
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
content
of
the
material
that
is
sold
inside
the
establishment.
the
disqualification
is
based
on
whether
this
individual
has
been
convicted
of
prostitution
or
public
lewdness
or
promotion
of
prostitution,
or
one
of
the
other
of
13
crimes
that
serve
as
a
disqualification.
but
we
are
not
saying
that
individuals
cannot
express
themselves
through
sexually
explicit
material,
if
that
is
what
they
want
to
do,
just
because
they
have
had
this
license
denied.
they
may
sell
this
same
material,
either
wholesale
through
the
mail,
even
door
to
door,
and
in
fact,
the
day
after
a
license
is
denied
or
revoked,
they
can
sell
the
same
material
that
was
sold
inside
the
business
out
on
the
street
corner.
there
is
nothing
to
prohibit
it.
i
think
that
graphically
illustrates
that
this
ordinance
has
nothing
to
do
with
restraining
any
particular
expressive
material
or
an
individual's
right
to
sell
it.
it
only
relates
to
the
operation
of
a
commercial
business.
i
think,
given
the
legitimate
and
substantial
interest
that
the
city
has
that
led
to
the
passage
of
this
ordinance,
the
city's
position
is
that
the
minimal
incidental
burden
that
it
places
on
the
individual's
right
is
more
than
outweighed
by
the
city's
substantial
interest.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
no,
there
isn't.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
no.
as
a
practical
matter,
in
the
city
of
dallas,
we...
there
has
been
no
confusion
over
that
question
because
these
businesses
for
the
most
part
are
100
percent
sexually
explicit
material.
however,
we've
had...
given
some
thought
to
how...
if
we
were
called
on
to
draw
the
line,
how
would
we
do
it.
i
think
there
are
several
factors
that
would
enter
into
that.
one
would
be
the
percentage
of
the
business
in
terms
of
display
in
the
store
and
amount
of
sales,
but
equally
important,
i
think,
is
the
way
the
proprietor
advertises
the
business.
because
a
sexually
explicit
business
has
to
attract
a
certain
clientele,
and
if
you
don't
advertise
it
you
won't
get
that
clientele.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
i'm
saying
that
could
be
one
of
the
factors
in
the
determination.
the
other
is
the
amount
of
display
and
the
percentage
of
sales.
in...
in...
in
discussing
what
percentage
would...
would
it
take
to
make
this
a
sexually
explicit
business,
i
think
we
have
discussed
10
percent
to
25
percent
of
the
business
being
in
that
type
of
materials
as
triggering
that
that
is
a
principal
business
purpose
of
that
particular
business.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
no,
that
would
not
be
a
principal
business
purpose
of
that
store.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
one
book?
out
of
thousands?
ms.
analeslie
muncy
oh.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
oh,
i
see.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
literary
value.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
no,
because--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--there
is
exception
from
the
licensing
requirements
for,
and
from
the
location
requirements,
for
books
with
literary
value.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
each.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
what
i
am
saying
is,
you
have
told
me
that
only
one
book
qualifies
for
the
licensing
provisions
under
the
ordinance,
and
what
i
am
saying
is
that
means
that
it
is
not
a
principal
business
purpose
of
that
store.
because
the
other,
remainder
of
the
10
percent,
are
exempt
under
the
exception
for
literary
value.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
all
right.
i
think
we're
talking
past
each
other.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
the,
each
book
of
the
10
percent,
except
one,
is
exempt
from
the
licensing
requirement.
each
but
one.
and
only
one
book
qualifies
as
sexually
explicit
with
no
literary
value,
if
i
understand
your
hypothetical
correctly.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
i
think
i
understand
your
question.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
it
will
not
qualify
as
a
principal
business
purpose,
so
if
only
one
of
the
books
doesn't
meet
this
exception,
or
this
defense,
that's
my...
that's
what
i
am
saying
to
you.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
i
understand
what
you
are
saying,
and
my
response
would
be
that
it
wasn't
the
intent--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--no.
all
the
petitioner
bookstores
in
this
case
are
100
percent
sexually
explicit
materials.
and
just--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--i
don't
believe
so,
no.
no.
it's...
no.
but
just
to--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--yes,
a
facial
challenge.
it
was
decided
on
the
motions
for
summary
judgment.
but
just
to
comment
once
more
on
justice
scalia's
question.
the
way
i
am
describing
the
ordinance
is
the
intent
and
the
way
that
it
is
enforced.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
that's
correct.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
there...
there--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--the
court
has
invalidated
two
types
of
licensing
ordinances
that
don't
contain
the
freedman
protections.
first
is,
where
the
issuance
of
a
license,
is
dependent
upon
the
content
of
the
material.
and
the
second
is,
where
the
issuance
of
a
license,
is
dependent
upon
totally,
unbridled
discretion
of
the
issuing
official.
and
neither
of
those
situations
applies
in
this
case.
there
is
nothing
in
the
issuance
of
the
license
that
has
anything
to
do
with
the
content
of
the
material
in
this
licensing
system.
and
secondly--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--i
don't
think
the
riley
case
is
applicable
here
at
all.
first...
first
of
all,
i
believe
the
court
in
the
riley
case
said
that
that
was
a
content-based
statute.
this
is
a
content-neutral
ordinance.
and
second
of
all,
the
licensing
portion
of
the
ordinance...
of
the
law
in
the
riley
case,
was
invalidated
because
there
was
no
time
limit
on
when...
it
license
could
be
issued.
and
in
this
case
we
have
a
30-day
time
limit.
the
chief
is
required
to
issue
the
license
within
30
days.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
that's...
that's
correct.
but
each
of
the
requirements
for
the
license
is
objective,
and
it
serves
and
provides
criteria
for
a
court
to
determine
very
easily
if
there
has
been
any
abuse
of
those
requirements.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
i
don't
believe
riley
addressed
that
issue.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
petitioners
argued--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--yes.
petitioners
argued
in
their
reply
brief
that
that
was...
could
be
used
as
a
delaying
tactic.
but
let
me
say,
the
way
the
ordinance
is
administered,
when
an
applicant
puts
in
his
application
he
is
given
the
telephone
numbers
of
the
inspectors,
he
is
told
to
call
them,
set
up
an
appointment
for
when
he
will
be
there
to
allow
the
inspectors
to
inspect
the
business,
and
every
effort
is
made
to
get
everything
done
within
30
days.
if--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--that
is
correct.
and...
and
with
respect
to
the
inspection
provisions,
because
much
has
been
made
of
that,
under
the
dallas
development
code
every...
every
business
is
required
to
get
a
certificate
of
occupancy
when
it
moves
into
a
new
location
and...
and
the
use
of
that
structure
changes.
those
requirements
for
a
certificate
of
occupancy
and
the
inspections
that
are
required
in
that
instance
are
exactly
the
same
as
the
inspection...
provisions
that
are
in
this
ordinance.
so
there
is
nothing
different
or
unique
about
these
inspection
provisions
than
apply
to
all
businesses
that
operate
in
the
city.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
no,
we
do
not.
it
is
the
same
for--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--i
can't
answer
for
other
texas
cities.
all...
all
businesses
must
have
a
certificate
of
occupancy
that
require
these
inspection
provisions.
for
just
a...
a
moment,
let
me
comment
on
some
of
the
arguments
that
counsel
made.
on
the
question
of
principal
business
purpose
not
being
in
the
language
regarding
video
arcades
and
movie
theaters,
there
the
language
is
"regularly
features
sexually
explicit
films".
i
have
already
addressed
the
question
of
the
time
period,
there
is
a
30
day
time
period
with
regard
to
issuance
of
the
license
under
this
ordinance.
if
the
court
has
a
problem
with
analyzing
the
licensing
provisions
under
a
time,
place
and
manners
standard,
i
don't
think
the
court
should
have
any
problem
in
applying
the
o'brien
standard
to
the
dallas
ordinance.
the...
the
incidental
restriction
that
this
ordinance
places
on
a...
a...
an
individual's
first
amendment
rights
is
not
substantially
broader
than
necessary
to
accomplish
the
city's
crime
control
interests.
and
the
requirements
and...
and
the
disqualifications
apply
only
to
businesses
that
are
documented
to
cause
these
types
of
sex-related
crimes,
and
only
sex-related
crimes
serve
as
disqualifications.
so
i
believe
that
the
court
can
apply
the
o'brien
standard,
and
it's
our
position
that...
that
the
provisions
of
this
ordinance
pass
muster
very
easily
under
that
intermediate
level
of
first
amendment
analysis.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
the
studies
that
are
conducted
by
the
other
cities
generally
found
the
increase
was
in
sex-related
crime.
the
study
that
the
city
of
dallas
conducted
in
the
areas
that
it
looked
at
were
in
other
kinds
of
crime
as
well,
and
in
fact
found
that
the
increase
in
crime
in
the
dallas
area
around
where
these
businesses
were
located
was
90
percent
higher
than
comparable
commercial
areas
where
they
are
not
located.
ms.
analeslie
muncy
yes,
assaults--
ms.
analeslie
muncy
--it
is
only
for
sex-related
crimes,
and
the
lower...
we
had
other
crimes
serving
as
disqualifications
and
the
district
court
found
that
those
were
not
sufficiently
related
to
the
licensing
purpose,
and
so
we
removed
those
other
crimes
from
the
ordinance
before
it
was
appealed
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
licensing
provisions
of
the
dallas
ordinance
have
considerably
less
direct
impact
on
the
first
amendment
rights
of
these
individuals
than
do
the
location
requirements
in
the
ordinance,
but
they
are
equally
important
to
the
city's
crime
control
purposes.
and
so,
for
sound
policy
reasons
as
well
as
cogent
legal
justifications,
we
submit
that
the
court
should
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
thank
you
very
much.
