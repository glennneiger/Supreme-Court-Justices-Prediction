justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
take
the
position
that
commercial
sales
of
sexually
explicit
speech
are
entitled
to
exactly
the
same
protection
as,
for
example,
a
political
rally.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
this
at
least
commercial
speech?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what,
in
a
nutshell,
are
the
requirements
that
you
say
have
to
be
met?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
legislative
body
of
course
determines
the
penalties
for
criminal
offenses.
why
can't
the
legislative
body
say,
in
addition
to
whatever
else
is
imposed
in
criminal
sentencing,
we
determine
it's
inappropriate
for
someone
convicted
of
certain
crimes,
for
a
certain
period
of
time,
to
go
into
the
business
of
selling
sexually
explicit
material?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
didn't
those
studies
have
to
do
with
the
problems
arising
from
the
concentration
of
such
businesses?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
the
studies
basically...
address...
addressed
the
concentration
or
the
location
of
the
in
neighborhoods
or
adjacent
to
schools.
did
any
of
them
address
the
question...
i
guess
dallas
has
zoning
ordinances
in
effect
requiring
that
such
businesses,
the
businesses
in
question
here,
be
spread
out
and
located
in
only
certain
areas.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
not
at
issue
here.
what
is
at
issue
is
an
additional
requirement,
to
wit,
the
licensing
requirement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
studies
have
to
do
with
the
effect
of
letting
someone
who
has
been
previously
convicted
of
any
of
these
offenses
go
into
business
again?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
they
really
supported
the
zoning
aspects,
didn't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
the
licensing
aspects?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that's
what
the
riley
case
found?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
it's...
if
it's
denied,
there
is
no
provision
that
the
city
must
take
it
to
court
and
bear
the
burden
of
proof.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
riley
say
that
was
an
exception?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
these
cases
come
to
the
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
they
require
us
to
determine
whether
a
licensing
scheme
and
a
comprehensive
city
ordinance
regulating
sexually
oriented
businesses
is
a
prior
restraint
that
fails
to
provide
adequate
procedural
safeguards
as
required
by
the
case
of
freedman
versus
maryland,
one
of
our
precedents.
in
a
number
of
opinions,
which
may
even
exceed
the
number
of
justices,
i
am
not
sure,
the
court
has
resolved
the
case
in
essence
as
follows:
with
respect
to
those
sexually
oriented
businesses
engaging
in
first
amendment
activity
that
the
licensing
scheme
fails
to
provide
adequate
procedural
safeguards,
the
scheme
is
unconstitutional
because
it
fails
to
set
a
definite
time
limit
within
which
the
city
must
approve
or
deny
a
license,
and
because
it
fails
to
provide
for
expeditious
judicial
review
if
a
license
is
denied.
we
also
hold
that
the
petitioners
have
failed
to
prove
that
any
petitioner
has
standing
to
challenge
the
civil
disability
provision
of
the
ordinance.
finally,
we
hold
the
city
has
sufficiently
justified
its
requirement
that
adult
motels
renting
in
for
less
than
10
hours,
and
that
the
ordinance
does
not
infringe
the
right
to
freedom
of
association.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
then
is
affirmed
in
part,
reversed
in
part,
vacated
in
part,
and
the
cases
are
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion

the
judgment
in
