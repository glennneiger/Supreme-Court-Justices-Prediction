mr.
john
h.
weston
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
these
three
consolidated
cases
present
various
challenges
to
this
dallas
licensing
ordinance.
the
fw/pbs
petitioners
and
the
m.j.r.
petitioners,
bookstores,
motion
picture
theaters,
arcades,
cabarets,
attack
the
ordinance
on
various
first
amendment
grounds
arising
from
their
communicative
activities.
the
calvin
berry,
iii
petitioners,
motels,
are
included
within
the
scope
of
the
ordinance
solely
because
they
provide
room
rentals
for
periods
of
less
than
10
hours.
they
assert
a
different
challenge,
the
absence
of
any
justification
for
including
them
within
the
ordinance.
if
the
court
please,
i
will
turn
to
the
berry
matter
first.
under
the
ordinance,
hotels
or
others
providing
rooms
for
rent
for
less
than
10
hours
are
qualified,
or
are
included
as
sexually
oriented
businesses.
and
also
under
the
ordinance
no
one
may
rent
rooms
for
less
than
10
hours
unless
they
have
license
under
the
ordinance.
on
its
face,
this
legislation
applies
not
only
to
petitioners'
hotels,
but
also
to
the
hilton,
to
holiday
inn,
the
sheraton,
as
well
as
other
hotels
and
motels
which
provide
accommodations
for
those
in
the
airline
industry
and
truckers
and
others
on
travel-sensitive
and
short
schedules.
given
the
lack
of
any
reference
whatsoever
in
this
record
or
in
the
entire
legislative
process
to
short-term
rental
establishments,
petitioners
respectfully
assert
that
the
scheme
as
to
them
is
over
inclusive
and
irrational,
and
is
violative
of
equal
protection
and
due
process
of
the
laws.
and
if
the
court
please,
i
will
now
turn
to
the
arguments
of
the
other
two
petitioners.
respondents
invite
this
court
to
make
radical
and
wholesale
reductions
in
the
most
basic
protections
of
the
first
amendment
which
have
traditionally
safeguarded
expression
in
this
country.
they
attempt
to
justify
their
ordinance
by
several
quite
remarkable
propositions,
including
their
statement
that
under
the
ordinance
no
religious
or
political
discourse
would
be
restrained.
i
suppose,
fairly,
their
argument
extends
to
that
if
speech
does
not
contain
a
component
of
religious
or
political
discourse,
it
is
then
subject
to
lesser
and
perhaps
ultimately
no
first
amendment
protection.
if
the
first
amendment
is
to
have
any
continuing
long-or
short-term
validity,
respondents
arguments
must
be
resoundingly
rejected.
this
court
has
consistently
held
over
a
long,
long
period
of
time--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--if
i
can't
get
a
resounding
rejection
i
would
accept
a
grudging
one,
justice
scalia,
as
long
as
it
is
unequivocal.
this
court
has
held
over
a
long,
long
period
of
time
that
any
laws
requiring,
as
a
precondition
to
the
engaging
in
speech,
licenses--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--well,
i
think
that's...
that's
true,
your
honor.
there
is...
certainly
consideration
charged
for
the
expression,
but
this
court
has
continually
held
that
the
fact
that
there
was
a
charge
attendant
to
expression
itself,
whether
it
be
in
the
context
of
the
sale
of
a
newspaper
or
the
sale
of
a
book
or
the
selling
of
an
admission
ticket
for
a
ballet
dance
or
for
theater,
certainly
was
no
indication--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--well,
of
course,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'm
sorry,
our
point
is
not
that
a
license
per
se
is
impermissible.
of
course
not.
but
rather
that
any
license
of
this
nature
must
be
construed,
must
be
evaluated,
as
this
court
always
has,
as
a
prior
restraint
in
the
beginning.
mr.
john
h.
weston
because
without
the
license
one
may
not
engage
in
the
speech.
and
as
this
court
recently
noted,
its...
in
summarizing
its
decisions
on
prior
restraint,
that
a
prior
restraint
is
classically
that
circumstance
where
government
can
deny
or
does
deny
a
form
in
advance
of
expression.
one
may
not
engage
in
the
speech
until
one
has
a
license.
one
may
not
obtain...
one
does
not
get
the
license
simply
on
paying
the
filing
fee
and
paying...
and
paying
one's
money
and
filing
the
application.
mr.
john
h.
weston
is
a
classical
prior
restraint,
although
it
may
be
an
adequate
and
a
valid
prior
restraint.
as
the
chief
justice
well
knows,
not
all
prior
restraints
are
invalid.
they
simply
start
off
requiring
the
extremely
heavy
scrutiny
of
this
or
any
constitutional
court,
and
they
come
to
this
court
or
any
other
court
with
a
heavy
presumption
against
their
invalidity.
that
is
the
only
point
that
we
make.
and
because
the
governmental
power
inherent
in
these
prior
restraints
is
so
extraordinary,
a
set
of
rules
involving
strict
scrutiny
has
of
course
been
set
up
to
ensure
that
government
does
not,
intentionally
or
unintentionally,
abuse
the
extraordinary
power
which
these
devices
give
them.
mr.
john
h.
weston
we
take
the
position
that
there
is
no
justification,
justice
o'connor,
for
creating
any
sort
of
hierarchy
for
speech
under
our
constitutional
framework.
we
certainly
think
that
there
is
nothing
that
indicates
that
the
founders
or
the
framers
had
any
such
concept.
we
see
no
justification
for
doing
so,
and
quite
frankly,
the
response
i
guess
to
the
implied
question
might
well
be
why,
and
followed
by
what
next.
the
establishment
of
any
hierarchy
of
speech
diminishes
ultimately
the
value
of
all
speech.
and
we
would
respectfully
submit--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--well,
the
court
obviously
has
wrestled
with
the
question
of--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--no,
i
think
that--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--no.
i
think
that
generically
the
court
certainly
has
indicated
that
at
least
commercial
speech,
in
some
circumstances,
is
not
entitled
to
the
same
speech,
but
i
think--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--no,
your
honor,
this
would
not
qualify
as
commercial
speech
any
more
than
the
sale
of
a
book,
the
sale
of
a
newspaper,
the
sale
of
a
ticket
to
a
lock
concert
or
whatever.
this
speech
is,
in
essence,
speech
or
pure
speech,
which
is
to
be
construed
and
viewed
exactly
in
that
context,
separate
from
the
commercial,
commerciality
of
the
message,
which
lends
the
potentially
second-class
status
to
commercial
speech.
the
point
i
was
going
to
make,
justice
stevens,
is
simply
that
the
aspects
of
commercial
speech
seem
really
to
be
more
akin
almost
to
a
time,
place
and
manner
circumstance
with
respect
to
it,
rather
than
the
content
of
the
message
of
the
commercial
speech.
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
we
know,
justice
scalia,
that
at
least
up
until
the
present
a
continuing
majority
of
this
court
has
held
that
obscene
speech
is
simply
expression,
but
not
speech
in
the
first
amendment
sense.
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
with
all
respect--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--again,
not
wishing
to
play
games
at
all,
but
this
court's
decisions
have
made
clear
that,
for
purposes
of
the
first
amendment,
obscenity
is
not
speech.
it
is
expression,
but
it
is
not
speech.
and
therefore,
it
is
not
entitled,
after
determinations
of
obscenity,
that
it
is
nonspeech,
to
any
of
the
protections.
it
may
be
seized,
it
may
be
destroyed.
it
simply
offers
none
of
the
incidence
of
protected
quality
which
the
expression
in
this
case
manifestly
retains,
because
this
material
is
not
alleged
to
be
obscene,
and
the
standard
for
judging
it
or
identifying
it--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--well,
again--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--but
not
on
the
basis...
well,
obviously.
perhaps
we
should
define
terms.
obscenity
is
that
erotic
expression
which
has
been
determined
to
be
beyond
the
pale
of
the
first
amendment;
it
is
nonspeech.
commercial
speech,
as
i
have
suggested,
is
not
so
determined
by
reference
to
its
content.
it
is
more
its
purpose
or
its
offered
role
or
why
it
is
being
done
in...
in
connection
with
any
analysis
that
may
be
provided.
it
really
is,
i
believe,
analytically,
much
more
of
a
time,
place
or
manner
type
of
restriction.
with
respect
to
pornography,
sexually
oriented
speech,
i
am
not
aware
of
any
majority
holding
of
this
court
which,
on
the
basis
of
its
being
sexually
oriented
speech,
has
concluded
that
it
is
entitled
to
less
protection.
certainly,
i
am
aware
of
what
i
respectfully
call
some
tentative
forays
in
that
direction,
but
i
do
not
believe,
and
i...
i
feel
quite
certain
in
saying,
that
there
has
been
no
such
ruling
on
the
part
of
this
court.
mr.
john
h.
weston
defamatory
speech
typically
has
also
been
considered
to
be
speech
which
is
simply
beyond
the
pale--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--well,
i
think
that
is
fair.
but
again,
defamatory
speech
is
subject
to
whatever
restraints
or
whatever
inhibitions
only
after
a
determination
that
it
falls
into
this
quasi
or
this
specifically
unprotected
category.
mr.
john
h.
weston
i...
i
think
there
would
not
be
a
problem
determining
that
speech
were
sexually
oriented.
i
think
the
problem
would
then
be
in
terms
of,
at
least
with
respect
to
that
aspect
of
it,
exactly
how
broad
the
category
would
be.
because
if
one,
for
example
takes
a
look
at
the
definitional
language
in
this
ordinance,
it
makes
very,
very
clear
that
even
verbal
descriptions
of
sexual
activity
bring
material
within
the
category
under
the
ordinance.
i
suspect
that
this
would
include
ulysses,
and
the
extraordinary
james
joyce
depictions
of
a
very
explicit
sex
in
the
molly
bloom
soliloquy,
as
well
as
it
would
contain
harlequin
dime
store
novels
which
deal
extensively,
and
if
not
explicitly,
describe
certainly
implied
ultimate
sexual
activity.
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
interestingly,
justice
scalia,
the
ordinance
says
that
only
with
respect
to
bookstores,
and
that
may
well
be
why
the
city
in
its
brief
discussed
bookstores
only.
the
other
media,
interestingly,
are
described
in
much
more
elastic
terms.
for
example,
with
respect
to
arcades,
it's
clear
that
the
dissemination
of
even
one
film
with
a
sexually
oriented--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--yes,
we
have
arcades,
we
have
bookstores,
we
have
theaters,
we
have
adult
cabarets,
we
have
a...
a
rather
broad
array.
mr.
john
h.
weston
no,
no,
your
honor.
they
do
not
include
sexual
encounter
establishments
and
nude
modeling
establishments.
but
they
include
all
of
the
potential
speech
oriented
businesses,
which
are--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--no,
i
think
that
it
would
have
to
be
evaluated
in,
with
respect--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--the--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--well,
on
the
face
it
may
appear
that
way,
but
it
is
very
unclear
as
to
what,
in
the
literal
language
of
the
ordinance,
is
a...
a
principal
business
purpose,
in
terms
of
what
exact...
as
opposed
to
primary...
and
that
may
make...
i'm
not
trying
to
split
hairs,
that
may
make
some
semantical
difference,
because
the
term
is...
and
a
practical
difference.
the
term
is
simply
not
defined
anywhere
in
the
ordinance.
but...
i...
what...
the
notion
clearly
is,
is
that
under
the
dallas
ordinance
one
may
not
disseminate
the
speech
one
has
chosen
to
disseminate,
absent
obtaining
a
permit.
the
only
way,
under
the
implication
in...
in
your
honor's
question,
that
one
may
do
so,
is
by
agreeing
to
or
choosing
to
disseminate
other
speech
which
would...
which
one
would
not
otherwise
do,
some
governmentally
implied
alternative
speech,
in
order
to
qualify
under
the
ordinance.
so,
given
that
one
could
not
justify
the
ordinance
by
requiring
one
to
carry
speech
which
otherwise
one
would
not,
riley,
terminiello,
one
would
think
that
in
a
real
sense,
justice
scalia,
this
piece
of
legislation
does
in
fact
impose
a
total
prior
restraint
in
the
city
of
dallas
on
the
ability
of
one
to
disseminate
the
speech
one
chooses
in
the
absence
of
obtaining
the
permit.
mr.
john
h.
weston
no,
because...
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
john
h.
weston
because
one
would...
well,
i
suppose
theoretically--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--unless--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--i...
i
think
that
is
probably
a
fair
observation.
one
could
sell
95
percent
a
box
of
five
cent
kleenex,
or
"kleenices"
and
at
the
same
time
have
one's
entire
other
selection
be
sexually
oriented
expression,
and
conceivably,
and
again
we
don't
know
how
the
legislation
will
be
dealt
with,
but
of
course
the
point
would
be
what
is
one's
principal
business
purpose.
and
if
the
purpose
was
deemed
to
be
the
sexually
oriented
material,
notwithstanding
the
acres
and
acres
of
shelves
of
kleenex
boxes,
apparently
the
ordinance
would
still
require
qualification.
in
my
experience
with
these
kinds
of
ordinances
around
the
country,
and
it
now
spans
more
years
than
i
would
like
to
admit...
these
definitional
aspects
are
expanded
consistently
to
deal
with
whatever
attempts
are
made
by
businesses
to
exempt
themselves
from
the
scope
of
the...
of
the
legislation.
and
so
we
would
conclude,
with
respect
to
this
portion,
by
simply
noting
that
in
a
fair
and
principled
sense
this
legislation
is
indeed
a
prior
restraint.
one
may
not
disseminate
the
speech
of
one's
choice
in
a
real
sense,
and
depending
on
which
of
the
media
are
involved,
without
applying
for
and
being
granted
the
permit.
and
it
is
manifestly
clear
that
none
of
the
freedman
level
safeguards
are
contained
within
it,
there
is
no
time
period
within
which
the
city
must
grant
the
license
or
go
to
court
to
justify
the
denial.
there
is
no
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
city
to
go
to
court
to
justify
the
denial
at
all,
and
manifestly
there
is
no--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--but
not
in
riley,
mr.
chief
justice,
where
it
was
exactly
a
periodic--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--well,
yes,
but
the
significance
of
riley,
of
course,
is
that
riley
expands
the
item
specific
factual
setting
of
freedman
and
many
of
the
subsequent
cases,
and
applies
it
to
the
totally
so-called
content
neutral
requirement
of
obtaining
a
periodic
license
as
a
precondition
to
be
able
to
engage
in
speech
where
the
purpose
of
the
speech
was
to
raise
money.
riley
is,
with
all
respect,
an
unequivocal
application
of
the
freedman
doctrine
to
the
general,
mere
license
as
a
precondition
for
speech.
and
what
i
find
most
eloquent
in
the
city's
brief
is
that
at
no
point,
despite
our
frequent
references
to
riley
and
discussions
of
it
and
its
being
a
new
and
important
case,
not
one
mention
of
riley
or
attempt
to
distinguish
its...
its,
we
respectfully
submit,
clear
holding.
what
we
would
submit
is
for
all
of
the
reasons
which
underlie
the
riley
decision
and
the
absence
of
the
freedman
safeguards
with
respect
to
the
entirety
of
this--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--on
whether
the
applicant
is
entitled
to
the
license,
so
that
the
applicant
may
then
commence
the
applicant's
speech-oriented
business.
imagine,
let
me
just,
if
i
may--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--yes,
it
may...
it
may
well,
the
disqualification
potential--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--but
isn't
that
the
absolute
implication?
the
state
sets
us
a
licensure
requirement
which
says
that
before
you
may
speak
you
must
obtain
a
permit.
you
are
to
stay
in
limbo--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
it
is
fair
to
include
television
sets
within
it,
and
i
know
that's
not
the--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--yes.
the
burden
on
municipal
government
with
respect
to
it
is
de
minimis.
mr.
john
h.
weston
absolutely.
in
many,
many
communities,
if
not
most,
particularly
where
those
communities
truly
are
not
interested
in
stifling
any
message
or
eliminating
any
materials
disseminated
at
the
businesses.
what
those
ordinances
provide
is
that
they
have
special
time
periods
for
first
amendment
businesses,
for
expressive-oriented
businesses,
they
have
special
provisions
so
that
either
the
businesses
may
operate
on
the
filing
of
an
application
fee,
or
they
have
a
provision
that
states
that
either
the
permit
is
granted,
or...
is
denied
within
30
days
or
deemed
granted,
or
some...
or
some
time
period.
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
with
respect--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--yes.
mr.
john
h.
weston
certainly.
and
this
court
has
on
many
occasions
made
separate
and...
and
set
more
sensitive
requirements
in
connection
with
speech
businesses
or
speech...
speech-involved
circumstances,
simply
because
the
cost
of
not
doing
so
is
terribly,
terribly
great.
we
know
that--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--but,
mr.
chief
justice,
we're
not
suggesting
in
any
way
that
the
bookstore
shouldn't
be
subject
to
the
same
requirements.
mr.
john
h.
weston
because
we
have
placed
speech
and
the
first
amendment
at
a...
at
a
special--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--that
what,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
have
to
be
special
concerns--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--the
special
hearing--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--if
i
may--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--yes,
well,
riley
is
the
one
that
most
immediately
comes
to
mind.
but
the
contemplation
that
there
is
some
special
hearing
which
we
seek
in
connection
with
this
is
simply
not
the
position.
one
has,
municipally,
the
opportunity
to
appeals.
one
has
the
opportunity
to
litigation.
but
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that,
whereas,
just
as
a
store...
a
municipality
may
ban
bowling
alleys
or
may
ban
hardware
stores
or
incinerators,
or
may
subject
that
kind
of
activity
to
very,
very
long
periods
of
time
before
permitting
that
activity
to
go,
there
is
very
little
impetus
on
the
part
of
a
municipal
government
to
do
anything
to
frustrate
or
delay
or
retard
the
granting
of
the
permit.
there
is
simply
no
issue
that
the
speech
involved
in
the
concern
will
play
any
role.
this
is
not--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--it
would
seem--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--no,
i...
i
think
that's
a
fair
question--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--and
in
order
to
balance
it
out
it
would
seem
that
if
businesses
are
primarily
involved
with
expressive
activity,
then
they
should
be
dealt
with
in
a
way
that
permits
the
businesses
to
be
protected
from
what
we
all
know
to
be
the
case.
and
that
is
that
government
will
silence
by
delay
indirectly
if
it
cannot
silence
directly.
mr.
john
h.
weston
i
think
the
point...
well,
i
think
that
is
a
fair
implication
in
the
fair
sense,
justice
scalia,
of
what
this
court's
opinions
have...
have
indicated,
and
certainly
a
fair
sense
of
what
the
first
amendment
protections
have
been
designed
to
be,
and
must
be,
in
order
to
make
anything
more
than
a
hollow
promise,
the
guarantees
that
speech
will
not
be
interfered
with
before
a
final
judicial
determination
of
its
unprotectedness.
and
what
these
pieces
of
legislation
do
is
simply
permit
the
cities
to
be
able
to
do
indirectly
what
they
cannot
do
directly.
and
unless
we
can
maintain
this
kind
of
principled
articulation
of...
of
indication
to
government
that
where
the
first
amendment
is
concerned,
and
where
we
deal
with
primarily
first
amendment
or
expressive
businesses,
given
the
minimal
cost
to
government,
and
i
assure
you
that
these
are
minimal
costs.
we
are
not
dealing
with
nuclear
power
plants.
what
the
issue
is
here
is
a
retail
establishment
to
be
able
to
sell
books
or
to
show
movies.
that
is
the
bulk
of
what
the
conduct
is.
mr.
john
h.
weston
three,
justice
o'connor,
with
respect
to
this,
and...
and
particularly
dealing
with
the
municipal
piece
of
legislation
where
surely
the
municipal
government
is
not
in
a
position
to
control
the
progress
of
the
courts,
as
the...
as
state
government
may
well
be.
that
there
must
be
a
reasonable
time
period
within
which
government
must
either
grant
the
permit
which
government
has
said
is...
is
required
in...
in
order
to
do
the
speech
conduct.
secondly,
that
if
government
does
not
grant
the
permit
within
the
reasonable
period
of
time,
then
government
must
go
to
court
to
explain
why
it
has
failed
to
grant
the
permit.
and
lastly,
as
part
of
that
judicial
proceeding,
government
must
bear
the
burden
of
justifying
its
failure
to
grant
the
permit.
on
that
basis,
there
will
be
a
meaningful
opportunity
for...
for
businesses
not...
to...
to
be
protected
at
the
trench
level,
at
the...
at
the
street...
municipal
level
from
censorship
by
delay
and
administrative
and
bureaucratic
silence.
mr.
john
h.
weston
with
respect,
i
think
i
understand
your
question,
justice
kennedy.
with
respect
to
the
freedman
argument
that
i
have
made,
that
would
be
with
respect
to
the
totality
of
the
ordinance.
with
respect
to
the
specific
non,
either
speech
or
nonspeech
criminal
conviction
disqualification
provisions,
we
would
attack
those
independently.
most
immediate--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--or
probation--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--surely.
mr.
john
h.
weston
the
aspect
of
a
court
imposing
that
particular
post-probationary
limitation
is
simply
a
substitute
for
the
court's
having
the
opportunity
to
place
the
defendant
in
jail,
and
by
so
doing
deprive
the
defendant
of
doing
anything,
whether
it
be
any
sort
of
speech,
any
sort
of
business,
any
sort
of
normal
human
relationships.
that's
a
far
cry,
it
seems,
in
terms
of
the
analysis
of
a
city
not
involved
in
the
conviction
situation,
but
the
city
more
importantly
dealing
with
the
absolute
license
to
speak.
mr.
john
h.
weston
the...
but
once
again
we
know
that
a
prisoner
contained,
confined
in...
in
some
custodial
setting,
simply
loses
basic
rights
of
all
dimensions.
and
the
probationary
notion
is
simply
a
vicarious
extension
of
the
fact
that
the
defendant's
body
could
otherwise
be
imprisoned.
the
term
beyond
the
penal
period
is
simply
not
subject
to
continuing
restraint
with
respect
to
virtually
any
civil
rights,
at
least
as...
that
is
not
quite
entirely
true,
we
know
that
one
may
not
possess
a
gun,
in...
in
that
sense,
but
in
terms
of
fundamental
rights,
one,
those...
those
restraints
simply
do
not
endure.
with
respect
to
this
setting,
and
what
we
stress,
of
course,
is
the
obscenity
conviction
as
a
basis
for
disqualification
or
revocation,
is,
in
this
circumstance,
the
obscenity
conviction
clearly
violates
the
classical
prior
restraints
of
mere
citizens
for
better
austin
v.
keefe.
mr.
john
h.
weston
at
the
risk
of
sounding
simplistic,
the...
the
legislature,
with
respect
to
the
dallas
city
council,
is
simply
not
the
legislature
which
has
created
the
original
punishment
which
provided
the
judge
the
opportunity
to
keep
somebody
in
jail
for
ten
or
15
years.
mr.
john
h.
weston
well,
but
with
respect
to...
i'm
seeking
to
answer
the
question,
it
is
not
simply
a
question
of
legislative
power.
justice
scalia's
question,
justice
kennedy,
was
simply
why,
if
a
court
can
keep
an
individual
on
probation
where
the
court
had
the
opportunity
to
confine
that
body,
why
can't
a
different
legislature
set
a
series
of
criteria
for
its
own...
for
its
own
regulated
business.
and
the
two,
with
all
respect,
strike
me
as
complete
non
sequiturs.
the
judge
has
the
ability
to
keep
that
individual
in
jail;
the
judge
owns
that
person.
the...
the
difference--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--i...
i--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
note,
justice
o'connor,
really
there
are
two
aspects.
one,
of
course,
are
the
speech
predicate
offenses,
which
then
trigger
the
remedy
to
which
the
court
refers,
or
the
nonspeech
predicates
to
which...
which
trigger
the
same
remedy.
with
respect
to
the
speech
predicates
i
would
simply
note
that
it
was
the
state
of
minnesota
in
near
which
sought
to
create
the
disqualification
on
near
for
following
the
determinations
that
he
had
engaged
in
criminal
libel
or...
or...
or
libel.
so
it
would
appear
that,
for
this
court,
merely
ceding
the
right
to
create
this
disqualification
to
the
legislature
is
of
no
moment.
with
respect
to
the
analyses
for
the
nonspeech
predicate
conduct,
which
are
legion
throughout
this
legislation--
mr.
john
h.
weston
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'm
sorry.
