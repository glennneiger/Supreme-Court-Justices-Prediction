are
you
raising
any
question
of
standing
here
at
all
to
attack
that
particular
position?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
think
there
is
standing
here?
justice

that
goes
back
to
my
question.
i...
i'd
like
to
get
away
on
your
responses
to
the
implications
of
immorality.
suppose
the
individual
is
an
old
world
war
ii
buddy
who
lost
a
leg,
and
he
is
sympathetic
to
him,
and
invited
him
to
live
in
his
house.
he'd
still
be
disqualified?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
since
we
are
getting
into
this
matter,
counsel,
i...
i...
i
think
there
are
two
different
provisions.
one
is,
is
that
there
is
a
disqualification
if
a
spouse
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
the
second
is
a
disqualification
if
someone
is
residing
with
an
applicant
and
that
person
has
been
denied
a
license.
is
that
not
the
distinction?
so
i
think
your
case
is
slightly
stronger
than
it
sounds,
unless
i
am
misreading
the
ordinance.
