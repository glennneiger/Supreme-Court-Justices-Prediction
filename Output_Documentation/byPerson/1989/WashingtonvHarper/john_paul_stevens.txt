justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
right
there,
because
it's
kind
of
a
fundamental
question.
you...
in
your
brief
you
rely
in
part
on
turner
against
safley
and...
requiring
a
rational
connection
between
the
prison
administration
and
the
rule
at
issue.
and
i'm
wondering
in
this
case...
i
suppose
involuntary
medication
would
fairly
clearly
contribute
to
the
orderly
conduct
of
the
prison
and...
because
these
people
probably
would
be
less
difficult
to
manage
and
handle
if
they
are
medicated
than
if
they're
not.
is
that
a
proper
consideration,
do
you
think,
to
rely
on...
do
you
rely
in
part
on
that
consideration
or
do
you
take
the
position
that
it
has
to
entirely
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
prisoner?
justice
stevens
what
about
the--
--and
if
you're
right...
could
i
ask
just
this
one
other--
if
you're
right
on
that...
because
i
would
think
factually
you
would
have
a
pretty
easy
case
of
saying
it
makes
your
job
a
lot
easier...
do
we
really
have
to
face
up
to
the
rest
of
the
case?
isn't
that
a
sufficient
justification
all
by
itself
under
your
view?
justice
stevens
and
is
that
one
of
the
factors
that
the
panels
will
rely
on
in
administering
this
program?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
question
also?
justice
stevens
assuming
a
case
in
which
the
medical
equation
is
equal...
the
medic...
medical
people
conclude
it
may
not
do
any
good
and
it
probably
won't
do
any
harm,
but
it's
quite
clear
that
it
will
make
it
easier
to
manage
the
prison
if
you
have
this
very
obstreperous
person
sedated,
would
it
be
permissible
in
your
view
in
such
a
case
to
say
you
must...
you
may
go
ahead
and
give
the
drugs?
justice
stevens
mr.
larkin,
do
you
think
the
standard
for
a
prison
inmate
is
any
different
from
the
standard
for
a
person
who
has
been
committed
civilly
to
a
mental
hospital?
justice
stevens
so
then
your
analysis
wouldn't
rely
at
all
on
turner
against
safley
and
that
line
of
cases?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
i
think
your
position
is
a
little
different
than
the
state's
position
then.
justice
stevens
well,
the
state
court
answered
that
very
clearly.
they
said
that
it
has
to
be
in
the
man's
best
interest,
didn't
they?
justice
stevens
which
they
might
fail
that
test
even
if
he's
dangerous
and
even
if
he's
competent
or
incompetent.
justice
stevens
do
you
defend
the
position
of
the
state
supreme
court?
justice
stevens
mr.
phillips,
does
the
record
tell
us
how
many
prisoners
are...
will
be
affected
by
this
decision
in
washington?
justice
stevens
do
you
know
what
the...
what
the
success
rate
has
been
in
the
hearings?
has
the
judge
usually
said,
go
ahead
and
give
the
drugs,
or
has
he--
