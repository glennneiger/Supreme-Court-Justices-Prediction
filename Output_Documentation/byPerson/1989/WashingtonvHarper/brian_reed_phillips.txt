mr.
brian
reed
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
want
to
begin
by
emphasizing
the
nature
of
the
of
the
liberty
interests
at
issue
here,
and
in
doing
so,
i
want
to
make
a
couple
of
points
first.
mr.
harper
has
never
been
determined
to
be
incompetent.
mr.
harper
has
never
been
determined
by
a
court
to
require
treatment.
that
is,
to
suffer
from
a
mental
disorder
and
to
be
gravely
disabled
or
a
danger
to
others.
and
that
is
the
distinction.
counsel
for
the
petitioner
and
for
the
u.s.
government
keep
talking
about
treatment.
if
they
are
going
to
treat
mr.
harper,
then
it
seems
to
me
that,
one,
he
is
presumed
to
be
a
competent
person.
a
competent
person
has
the
right
to
refuse
treatment.
the
doctrine
of
informed
consent
implies
that
a
person
will
be
adequately
informed
and
will
voluntarily
consent
to
treatment.
and
that,
in
fact,
is
the...
is...
we
seek
to
protect
that
relationship
between
the
doctor
and
the
patient.
but
part
of
that
relationship
is
the
patient
saying
i
don't
want
the
treatment.
so,
it
seems
to
me
it's
very
important
in
deciding
this
case
to
make
a
very
strong
distinction
to
understand
what
we're
talking
about
between
the
parens
patriae
power
of
the
state
and
the
police
power
of
the
state,
those
two
interests.
they
are
very
different
and
they
have
different
implications
for
the
resolution
of
this
case.
i
disagree
with
counsel
when
he
indicates
that
the
soc
policy
says
that
it
must
be...
the
treatment...
the
involuntary
treatment
with
antipsychotic
drugs
must
be
for
treatment.
i
don't
think
it
says
that.
it
says
that
one
can
only
be
medicated
if
he
suffers
from
a
mental
disorder
and
as
a
result
of
that
is
gravely
disabled
or
presents
a
likelihood
of
harm
to
himself
or
to
others.
so,
mr.
harper
is
not
seeking
treatment.
he
is
seeking,
as
a
competent
adult...
presumed
to
be
and
no
judicial
findings
that
he
is
not...
to
refuse
treatment.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
uh-huh.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
uh-huh.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
well,
the
state
has
the
duty
and
the
obligation
because
mr.
harper
is
in
custody
to
offer
treatment,
certainly,
and
to
provide
a
minimum
level
of
treatment.
but
that
does
not
imply,
i
don't
think,
that
mr.
harper
has
a
corresponding
duty
to
accept
the
treatment.
the...
and
i
think
that's
where
we
get
the
confusion--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--yes,
he
does.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
and
i
think
that's...
the
two'
questions
posed
are
where
we
get
to
the
difficulty
in
this
case,
and
that
is
to
separate
out
the
parens
patriae
power
from
the
police
power
of
the
state.
and
i
would
submit
that
the
parens
patriae
power
of
the
state
does
not
extend
to
a
competent
prisoner
the
ability
of
the
state
to
force
treatment.
now,
the
police
power,
that's
a
different
issue.
and
i
think
when
we
look
at
the
police
power
interest
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
that
the
police
power
interest
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
long-term
involuntary
treatment
with
antipsychotic
medications
that
was
at
issue
in
this
case.
there
are,
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out,
other
alternatives.
restraints.
isolation
is
another
alternative.
now,
counsel
for
the
petitioner
indicated,
well,
those
don't
have
any
treatment
benefits.
well,
that
gets
back
into
the
parens
patriae
part
of
this
equation
because
once
the
state
decides
that
it's
going
to
help
its
prisoner,
then
you're
on
the
parens
patriae
side.
if
they're
going
to
control
the
prisoner
so...
to
maintain
institutional
calm
and
security,
of
course
the
state
has
the
right
to
do
that.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
yes.
yes,
they
do.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
but
the
point
is
that
on
the
parens
patriae
side
of
this
equation,
they
have
the
right...
they
have
the
obligation,
if
you
will,
to
provide
the
minimum
level
of
care.
but
we're
talking
about
a
competent
adult,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
fact
of
conviction
doesn't
extinguish
that
liberty
interest.
that
is,
the
liberty
interest
to
make
decisions
about
what
kind
of
drugs
we're
going
to
have
or
not
have.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
uh-huh.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
yes,
the
state
could.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
mental
ill...
illness
isn't
different.
what's
different
is
the
nature
of
the
intrusion.
now,
if,
for
example,
leprosy
was
being
treated
with
a
drug,
a
new
drug...
we
have
a
new
drug.
it's
an
experimental
drug;
we're
not
sure
it's
going
to
work.
it
may
work.
okay?
it
has
very
significant
side-effects.
in
80...
in
20
percent
of
all
cases
where
we
treat
leprosy
with
this
new
drug,
20
percent
of
the
people
die.
now,
this
person
says,
i
don't
want
to
take
that
risk.
i'm
a
competent
adult.
that
risk
is
a
little
too
great
for
me...
and
in...
60
percent
persons
are
severely
debilitated...
i
don't
want
to
take
that
risk.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
government's
got
to
respect
that.
however,
they
have
the
duty
to
maintain
other
prisoner's
health,
if
you
will.
okay.
so,
i
think
what
you
look
at
is
a
continuum.
what
is
the
nature
of
the
intrusion?
if
the
intrusion
is
minor,
you
need
to
take
aspirin.
if
that
will
calm
you
down,
you
need
to
take
aspirin.
no
problem.
you
need
to
take
cold
medicine
because
we
don't
want
you
spreading
the
risk
of
colds.
no
problem,
because
the
side-effects
aren't
so
serious.
you
need
to
take
antipsychotic
medications
where
you
run
the
risk
of
suffering
from...
and
mr.
harper
did
suffer
from...
dystonia
and
akathisia.
you'll
run
the
further
risk
of
suffering
from
tardive
dyskinesia,
which
may
not
appear
until
after
you
have
discontinued
treatment
and
which
is
correlated
with
high
dosages
and
long-term
treatment.
and
mr.
harper
was
on
these
drugs
for
a
very
significant
period
of
time.
years.
now,
does
the
state
have
the
right
to
say,
okay,
we're
going
to
treat
you
against
your
will
with
that?
yes,
in
fact,
they
do
if
they
go
and
have
a
judicial
determination
because
we
want
to
reduce
the
risk
of
error.
and
the
risk
of
error
is
inherent
in
this
kind
of
situation,
it
seems
to
me,
because
you're
talking
about
a
decision
made
within
the
institution,
a
decision
made
for
reasons
of
control,
i
submit,
as
much
as
reasons
of
treatment.
but
if
it's
made
for--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--okay.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
again,
i
think
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
intrusion.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
well--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--well,
on
the
parens
patriae
side
of
this
equation,
if
you
will,
on
the
treatment
side
of
this
equation,
i
am
a
sound
competent
adult.
that
does
not
mean
the
government
can
tell
me
that
i
need
to
accept
treatment.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
right.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
well,
i
think--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--uh-huh.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
it
depends...
i
think
it
depends
on
what...
i
don't
mean
to
be
disrespectful,
but
what
is
the
nature
of
the
intrusion?
the
intrusion
here
is
something
that
affects
the
mind.
now,
the
leprosy
example,
if
it's
a
pill,
if
it's
sulfa,
and
that's
going
to
treat
leprosy,
then
i
don't
think
there
is
any
problem
with
that.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
well,
but
then
we're
assuming
that
the
inmate
is
incompetent.
that
is,
he
is
irrational.
and
those
kinds
of--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--and
i
don't
see
how
a
criminal
conviction
does
away
with
the
liberty
rights
or
interests
to
make
decisions
concerning
one's--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--no,
i--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--no,
that's
not
my
answer.
my
answer
is--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--my
answer
is
it
would
depend
on
what
the
side-effects
were
of
the
treatment,
number
one.
okay?
and
you
could
treat
the
leper...
if
there
were
very
serious
side-effects...
okay,
no
rational
person
can
do
it.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
okay.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
then
i
think
you'd
need
to
go
to
a
court
and
have
a
proceeding--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--in
the
situation
of
a
rational...
no
rational
person
would
refuse
this
treatment?
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
i
think
a
court
needs
to
decide
that
that
is
in
fact
the
case.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
well,
i
think
in...
on
the
parens
patriae
side
of
this
you're
asking...
what
you're
asking
is
for
a
substituted
judgment,
and
courts
make
those
kinds
of
judgments
all
the
time.
courts
decide
in
competency
proceedings
to
make
those
kinds
of
judgments.
they
decide,
based...
informed
by
psychiatric
decisions.
but--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--well--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--and
there
i
think
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
liberty
interest
and
the
nature
of
the
intrusion.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
yes,
it
is.
and
mr....
mr....
in
youngberg
v.
romero,
mr.
romero
had
been
committed
by
court
order.
mr.
harper...
a
court
order
relative
to
his
mental
status.
mr.
harper
hasn't
had
that
kind
of
decision...
which
has
resulted
in
this
incarceration
and
this
treatment.
mr.
youngberg
was
seeking
habilitation,
not
seeking
to
refuse
treatment.
mr.
youngberg
was
restrained
by
soft
restraints.
it's
not
the
same
kind
of
liberty
interest,
the
right
to
be
free
form
the
forced
administration
of
antipsychotic
drugs.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
i
think
that's
a
lot
closer.
yes.
yes,
that
would...
that
would
essentially
satisfy
me.
what
the
particulars
are
of
the
procedure--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--i...
i'm
not
saying
that
the
particular
dosage
or
the
particular
type
of
antipsychotic
drug
would
be
determined
by
the
court.
no,
that's
not
necessary.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
no,
i
would
think
that
there
would
have
to
be
some
periodic
review.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
i
think
review
of...
the
lower
court
in
this
situation
has
indicated
that
before
you
can
treat
you
need
to
in
part
make
a
competency
determination
because
they
talked
about
a
substituted
judgment.
but
you
need
to
decide
that
there
is
a
mental
disorder
and
that...
excuse
me,
you
need
to
decide
that
there
is
a
compelling
state
interest
and
the
safety
of
other
prisoners
or
staff
certainly
would
be,
that
that
interest
would
be
served
by
the
administration
of
antipsychotic
medications,
and
that
the
court
is
then
to
look--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--well,
i...
i'd
prefer
the
lower
court's
decision.
and
i
think
it's
more
appropriate,
given
the
type
of
liberty
interest
at
stake
and
given
the
type
of
side-effects
that
are
present
or
implicated
that
mr.
harper
suffered
and
that
are
implicated
by
these
medications.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
no.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
in
line
with
civil
commitment
acts...
in
line
with
the
civil
commitment
statutes--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--in
the
state
of
washington.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
certainly.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
and
i
don't--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--well--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--mr.
harper's
position
is
he's
never
been
seen
by
a
court
with
respect
to
his
mental
status
that
has
led
to
this
incarceration
and
that
has
given
him
drugs,
and
he
wants
to
be
seen
by
a
court.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
i
think
that
the
court...
when
the
court
looks--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--uh-huh.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
well,
i
think
that's
a
question
that
the
court
is
going
to
have
to
deal
with.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
well--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--that
the
prisoner
is
in...
is
incompetent,
the
prisoner
is
competent
but
has
been
committed.
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--okay.
i
think
that
the
court
must
decide
that
before
one
can
be
involuntarily
administered
with
antipsychotic
drugs
on
a
long-term
basis
there
must
be
a
court
hearing
which
resolves
the
question
of...
yes,
i
think
it
needs
to
resolve
the
question
of
competency.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
it
needs
to
resolve
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
person
is
a
danger
to
himself
or
others.
that
is,
whether
or
not
there
is--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--no,
i
think
they
need
to
resolve
that
as
well.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
yes.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
if
he's
incompetent?
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
if
he's
competent.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
well,
i--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--yes,
they
did
say
it
had
to
be
in
his
best
interest.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
and
they
said
they
had
essentially
to
make
a
substituted
judgment.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
yes,
i
do.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
yeah.
i
think
you
could
treat
him
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
well,
yes,
i
think
it
is
true
even
if
the
drugs
alter
his
will.
i
think
that
the
question
see
on--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--uh-huh.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
i'm
sorry.
i
think
i'm
going
to
retreat
from
that.
i
don't
think
that
is
my
position.
i
apologize
to
the
court.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
no.
for
reasons
of
treating
him?
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
no.
that
would
alter
his
will?
that
would
alter
his
ability...
this
is--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--well,
that
would
be
a
very
effective
drugs...
in
some
countries
that
i
can
think
of
and...
and
would
probably
be
widely
used.
and
i
think
that's
where
the--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--if
he's
competent?
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
no,
i
think
it
would
not
be
permissible.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
well,
i
think
the
court
below
did
in
effect
require
a
competency
decision
by
referring
to
a
substituted
judgment
that
the
person
would
be
too
irrational
to
make
a
decision
and
that
the
court
in
so
doing...
"a
court
asked
to
order
antipsychotic
drug
treatment
for
a
nonconsenting
patient
must
therefore
consider
the
patient's
desires
before
entering
an
order.
"
so,
in
effect,
what
they're
doing
is
indicate...
is
making
a
statement
that
the
individual
is
incompetent,
it
seems
to
me.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
well,
the
court...
the
court
indicated
that
the
court
must
set
forth
findings
on,
among
other
things,
the
desires
of
the
patient
or
a
substituted
judgment
by
the
court...
is
what
the
court
indicated.
i
want
to
emphasize
the
importance
of
this
liberty
interest.
i
think
that
the
first
amendment
is
implicated
here.
it
was...
that
claim
by
the
respondent
was
not
addressed
by
the
lower
court,
but
i
think
it
is
an
important
consideration
in
deciding
how
important
this
liberty
interest
is
and
how
important
the
private
interest
is,
because
if
one
cannot
generate
ideas
or
if
one's
ability
to
generate
ideas
is
affected
by
mind-altering
drugs,
then
the
ability
to
express
those
ideas
is
going
to
be
similarly
affected.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
the
tradition
of--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--historically
in
this
country?
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
i'm
really
not
sure.
i
can
only
speak
to
what
has
occurred
in
the
state
of
washington
in
the
recent
past.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
i...
i
think
that
the
court
needs
to
bear
in
mind
the
implication...
the
first
amendment
implications
of
the
administration
of
antipsychotic
medications
in
deciding
this
case.
yes.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
exactly.
and...
what
mathews
teaches
us...
i
mean,
a
case
about
the
temporary
interruption
of
disability
benefits.
but
what
it
teaches
us,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
you
weight
the
factors
set
forth
in
mathews.
and
the
compelling
nature,
i
would
submit,
of
this
liberty
interest
weighs
very
heavily
in
favor
of
saying
to
the
state,
you
must
go
through
these
slight...
and
i
submit
it
is
very
slight...
administrative
burden
of
having
a
judicial
hearing
rather
than
the
hearing
panel.
in
response
to
this
decision,
the
harper
decision,
the
state
legislature
engrafted,
if
you
will,
the
harper
decision
onto
the
civil
commitment
laws
of
the
state
of
washington,
and
i
think
that's
a
recognition
that
this
isn't
so
burdensome.
in
response
to
vitek,
congress
required
judicial
hearings
for
the
transfer
from
a
prison
to
a
mental
health
hospital.
that's
an
indication
that
it
isn't
so
very
burdensome.
and
if
it's
not
so
very
burdensome,
then
what's
the
problem
with
providing
it
where
the
interest
is
so
significant
and
where
the
procedures
attendant
upon
a
judicial
hearing
are
going
to
be
more,
it
seems
to
me,
designed
to
make
a
correct
decision
with
less
potential
for
error.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
i
believe
it
indicates
in
the
findings
of
fact
that
there
were
some...
something
in
the
20s
who
were
at
the
special
offender
center
who
have
not
been
receiving...
who
were
refusing
antipsychotic
medications.
there
is
a
law
review
article
cited
in
my
memorandum,
i
think
at
page
93...
or,
excuse
me,
footnote
93...
which
was
done
seven
months
after...
five
months
after
the
decision,
which
indicated
that
during
that
five-month
period
there
had
been
three
hearings.
the
hearings
are...
this
is
not
in
the
record...
the
hearings
are
typically
held
at
the
institution
so
there
is
no
problem
with
security
and
so
forth.
and
it
simply
is
not
that
big
an
administrative
burden
where
the
liberty
at
interest
at
stake
is
so
important.
i
do
want
to
turn
to...
to
the
value
of
these
additional
safeguards,
and
in
doing
so
i
want
to
talk
about
how
the
procedure
took
place
in
this
case
at
the
institution
and
how
in
fact
it
takes
place
typically
at
the
special
offender
center
and--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--you
do
not
have
to
be
incompetent.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
no.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
well,
that's
the
rule
i
would
like
to
see
this
court
adopt.
yes.
but
i
don't
think
that
this
court...
i
mean,
mr.
harper
personally
would
be,
i
think,
less...
would
be
satisfied
if
he
had
a
hearing
somewhere
before
a
judge
and
not
a
decision
made
wholly
within
the
institution
because
when
the
decision
was
made
in
this
case...
and
is
typically
made
in...
within
the
institution...
what
occurs
is
the
staff
of
the
hospital
consult
outside
the
presence
of
mr.
harper
with
the
hearing
committee,
review
the
basis
for
their
decision
to
recommend
treatment,
discuss
whether
or
not
the
guidelines
have
been
met,
and
then
mr.
harper
is
brought
into
the
hearing.
i
don't
think
that
that
even
measures
up
to
the
kind
of
thing
neutral
fact-finder
required
in...
or,
the
kind
of
hearing
required
in
vitek
or
in...
or
in...
excuse
me.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
that,
of
course,
is
not
the
question
before
the
court.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
and
that
is
the
decision
that
has
been
made
by
the
washington
state
legislature,
for
example...
to
do
that.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
uh-huh.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
correct.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
for
behavior
modification
treatment.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
yes,
it's
not
as
intrusive.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
i
think
that's
a
very
important
factor.
in
vitek
it
isn't
as
intrusive
and
it
doesn't
have
the
kind
of
side-effects
that
this
medication
does.
i
want
to
make
another
point
about--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--right.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
well,
it--
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
--it...
it's
designed
to
alter
your
behavior
but
i
would
submit
that
one
can
refuse
to
participate.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
one
can
refuse
to
participate
in
the
treatment.
once
the
injection
or
the
drugs
are
administered
in
this
case,
your...
your
ability
to
refuse
in
the
treatment
ends,
and
it
doesn't
have
the
kind
of
side-effects
that...
it
doesn't
result
in
akathisia
or
dystonia,
or
these
other
side-effects.
the
other
point
i
think
about
the
procedures
here,
at
soc
the
first
time
that
mr.
harper
was
medicated,
the
treating
physician
was
dr.
pethridge.
two
weeks
later,
dr.
pethridge
is
not
the
treating
physician.
he
is
now
on
the
reviewing
committee.
there
was,
if
you
will,
a
rotating
door
between
being
a
treating
physician
and
being
the...
on
the
reviewing
committee.
four
psychiatrists
went
through
that
door.
that's
not
the
kind
of
of
independent,
neutral...
independent
decision-maker
or
neutral
fact-finder
that
i
think
is
required.
and
that's
one
of
the
dangers,
if
you
will,
of
allowing
the
institutions
to
adopt
their
own
procedures.
we
know
we
will
get
an
independent
detached
magistrate
in
a
court
of
law.
the...
in
addition,
there
is
no
announced
standard
of
evidence
or
standard
of
proof
with
respect
to
the
policies.
and
i
want
to
refer
to
addington
v.
texas
where
the
court
decided
that
a
clear,
cogent
and
convincing
standard
was
the
appropriate
standard
before
civil
commitment.
and
increasing
the
burden
of
proof
is
one
way
to
impress
the
fact-finder
with
the
importance
of
the
decision
and
thereby
perhaps
to
reduce
the
chances
that
inappropriate
commitments
will
be
ordered.
mr.
brian
reed
phillips
oh,
i'm
sorry.
