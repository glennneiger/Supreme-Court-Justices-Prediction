justice
white
isn't
the...
isn't
the
state
of
washington
now
under
this...
the
effect
of
this
judgment?
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
and
we
don't...
we
don't
vacate
state
judgments
if
they're
moot,
do
they...
do
we?
justice
white
well,
if
i
understand
you,
the
only
time
this
treatment
could
be
imposed
involuntarily
is
if
the
person
is
incompetent
to
make
his
own
decision.
justice
white
you...
you
would
think
that
even
if
a
person
is
competent
and
refuses,
a
court
could
say...
could
find
him
to
be
a
danger
to
himself
and
others
and
then
give
the--
justice
white
--well,
what
that
means
is--
justice
white
--a
civil
commitment
means
that
you
can
certainly
deprive
them
of
their
liberty--
justice
white
--and
restrain
them.
but
it
doesn't
mean
you
could
necessarily
give
them
psychotic
drugs
against
their
will
if
the
man
is
competent.
justice
white
i
thought...
i
understood
that
your
position
was
that
if
he's
competent
that's
the
end
of
the
story.
justice
white
they
may
not
involuntarily--
justice
white
--well,
i
know
that.
but
what's
the
court
supposed
to
find
out?
justice
white
suppose
they
find
him
competent--
justice
white
--but
a
danger
to
himself
and
others?
may
the
treatment
then
be
imposed?
justice
white
well,
what's
your
opinion
on
that?
i
think
it's--
justice
white
--i
think
that's...
i
think
it
depends
a
lot
on
how
this
case
comes
out.
what's
a
court
supposed
to
be
deciding?
justice
white
well,
what...
i
would
like
to
know
what
you
are
claiming
the
court
must
decide.
justice
white
yes.
anything
else?
justice
white
if
he's
incompetent...
if
he's
incompetent,
they
don't
need
to
resolve
that?
or--
justice
white
--if
he's...
even
though
he's
incompetent?
justice
white
and
if
he
is
competent,
they
resolve
that...
if
they
resolve
the
danger
element
against
him,
the
drugs
may
be
administered?
justice
white
no.
if
he's
competent.
justice
white
uh-huh.
justice
white
well,
in
vitek
there
was
a
prisoner...
involved
a
prisoner...
a
transfer
to
a
mental
institution.
justice
white
he
was
already
in
custody.
to
be
transferred
to
a
mental
institution
he
didn't
need
to
be
found
to
be
a
danger
to
himself
or
others?
justice
white
and
didn't
vitek
involve
a
transfer
for
treatment?
justice
white
yes.
which
is
different
than
this
kind
of
treatment?
justice
white
so,
it's
just
a
degree
of
intrusiveness?
justice
white
so
we
have
to...
we
have
to
distinguish
between
the
medications.
that
was
behavioral
modification
treatment--
justice
white
--in
vitek.
what
is
that?
what
does
that
do
to
you?
justice
white
that
this
doesn't
or
that...
what
does
this
do
to
you
that
that
doesn't?
justice
white
and
altering
your
will
a
little
bit?
justice
white
what...
oh,
excuse
me.
i
think
your
time
has--
justice
white
--[inaudible]
just...
just
behavior
modification
treatment
wouldn't
necessarily
involve
the
considerations
that
are
in
this
case?
