mr.
william
l.
williams
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
here
today
representing
prison
administrators
and
medical
professionals
who
are
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
the
welfare
of
mentally
ill
prisoners.
the
issue
before
the
court
is
what
due
process
requires
when
my
clients'
exercise
their
professional
judgment
in
making
a
medical
treatment
decision
regarding
a
mentally
ill
prisoner
who
refuses
to
take
prescribed
medications.
the
outcome
of
this
case
will
significantly
affect
not
only
my
clients'
ability
to
carry
out
their
responsibilities,
but
also
will
affect
the
lives
of
the
other
inmates
for
whom
my
clients
are
responsible.
at
issue
here
today
is
the
adequacy
of
a
policy
at
the
special
offender
center,
one
of
13
prisons
administered
by
the
washington
department
of
corrections,
which
authorizes
treatment
of
certain
serious
mental
illnesses
with
antipsychotic
medications.
this
is
the...
often...
or
widely
recognized
as
the
only
effective
treatment
for
certain
serious
mental
disorders,
including
schizophrenia,
which
was
the
diagnosis
for
the
respondent,
mr.
harper.
not
only
is
this
treatment
widely
recognized
as
the
only
effective
treatment
for
persons
in
that
situation,
it
is
also
generally
accepted
medical
knowledge
that
failure
to
provide
adequate
treatment
can
result
in
serious
adverse
consequences
to
the
mentally
ill
patient.
they
can
deteriorate
further.
they
can
continue
in
assaultive
and
disruptive
behavior.
they
can
become
self-destructive.
and
they
often
face
only
a
prospect
of
lifelong
institutionalization.
mr.
william
l.
williams
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
it
will
take
me
a
moment
to
explain.
mr.
harper
is
currently
at
western
state
hospital,
which
is
a
state
hospital
run
by
the
department
of
social
and
health
services.
while
mr.
harper
was
at
the
special
offender
center
in
january
of
1988,
he
was
charged
in
snohomish
county
superior
court
with
the
crime
of
assault.
in
those
criminal
proceedings,
which
are
still
pending
in
the
snohomish
county
superior
court,
his
defense
counsel
has
raised
the
question
of
his
competence
to
stand
trial.
mr.
william
l.
williams
well,
your
honor,
with
due
respect
to
counsel,
that
was
an
inaccurate
representation.
mr.
harper
had
been,
at
the
time
of
trial,
transferred
from
the
special
offender
center
to
the
washington
state
penitentiary,
which
is
another
prison--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--operated
by
the
department
of
corrections.
subsequent
to
the
trial,
in...
i
believe
it
was
in
april
of
1987,
he
was
transferred
back
to
the
special
offender
center,
and
beginning
in
september
of
1987--
mr.
william
l.
williams
yes,
ma'am.
yes,
your
honor.
in
september
of
1987
he
was
again
subjected
to
involuntary
medication...
pursuant
to
the
soc
policy
which
had
been
upheld
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
william
l.
williams
i
think
there--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--be
subjected--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--is
a
very
good
possibility.
the
trial
court
order...
the
criminal
trial
court
order
that
he
is
currently
at
western
state
hospital
on
terminates
in
october
of
this
year,
october
26th.
he'll
be
returned
to
snohomish
county
superior
court
and
either
be
found
competent
to
trial,
go
to
trial,
or
be
found
incompetent
to
stand
trial,
and
under
washington
law
the
charges
would
be
dismissed
without
prejudice.
in
either
one
of
those
events,
he
will
come
back
to
the
washington
department
of
corrections.
his
current
sentence
that
he
is
serving
now
and
was
serving
at
the
time
this
took
place
does
not
expire
until
1995,
and
the
earliest
he
could
even
be
considered
for
parole
currently
is
in
november
of
1992.
given
that,
and
given
that
he
continues
to
be
mentally
ill,
it
seems
very
likely
that
he
would
return
to
the
special
offender
center.
and
certainly,
then,
under
the
test
of
vitek
v.
jones,
this
case
is
not
moot.
mr.
william
l.
williams
that's
what
he
says,
your
honor,
but
that's
not
true.
mr.
william
l.
williams
he
was
at
the
special
offender
center
during
that
time
period,
and
beginning
in
september
of
'87
to
may
of
'88
he
was
involuntarily
medicated.
mr.
william
l.
williams
and
since
may
of
'88
he's
been
in
one
of
three
different
locations.
one
was
the
washington
state
penitentiary.
mr.
william
l.
williams
no,
your
honor,
he
was
not.
he
was
also
at
times
in
the
snohomish
county
jail
where
he
was
being
held
in
connection
with
the
pending
criminal
charges--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--i
do
not
know.
that's
run
by--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--by
snohomish
county,
not
the
department
of
corrections.
but
i
believe
that
to
be
the
case,
that
he
would
not--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--well,
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
it
is
not
moot
because
he
will
be...
probably
within
the
next
month,
but
certainly
within
the
next
few
months...
returned
to
the
department
of
corrections'
custody.
mr.
william
l.
williams
yes,
your
honor,
we
are.
mr.
william
l.
williams
and
that's
why
we're
here
today
seeking
the
judgment...
you...
the
judgment
of
the
washington
supreme
court
in
the
case
below.
is
that
the
judgment
you
refer
to,
your
honor?
mr.
william
l.
williams
and
that's
why
we're
here
seeking
to
have
that
overturned,
because
we...
if
that
decision
is
not
overturned,
then
of
course
we
would
be
foreclosed
from--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--not
in
any
published
decision
i
could
find,
your
honor.
i
noticed
in
the...
i
believe
it's
the
deakins
case...
there
is
a
discussion
of
vacating
federal
court
judgments
but
not
in
state
court
judgments.
in
this
context
the
issue
is
due
process.
now,
what
does
due
process
require?
the
court
has
frequently
said
that
due
process
requires
only
procedures
which
are
appropriate
under
the
circumstances.
in
the
parham
case,
the
court
said
that
the
nature
of
the
process
which
is
required
cannot
be
divorced
from
the
nature
of
the
ultimate
decision
being
made.
the
decision
here
is
a
medical
treatment
decision.
whether
recognized,
an
effective
treatment
will
be
administered
to
mentally
ill
prisoners.
mr.
william
l.
williams
no.
to...
we
rely
on
both,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
since
it
is
a
treatment
context,
it
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
prisoner.
but
also,
particularly
like
mr.
harper...
was
found
to
be,
and
the
court
below
found
him
to
be
a
threat
to...
a
danger
to
others.
and
so
we
believe
that
that
justifies
the
medication
as
well,
even
where
the
prisoner
feels
in
his
best
interests
he
wants
to
refuse
it
because
it
poses
a
risk
of
danger
to
other
inmates
and
other
staff.
mr.
william
l.
williams
well,
we
would
submit
that
it
is.
that
that
provides
at
least
an
alternative
basis
for
the
decision
that
we
are
seeking
from
the
court.
mr.
william
l.
williams
yes,
the
soc
policy
provides
that
the
medication
is
only
administered,
one,
for
the
person
who
is
mentally
ill...
so,
it
is
a
treatment
context.
secondly,
where
the
person
is
either
a
danger
to
himself
or
others
or
gravely
disabled,
and
those
are
very
detailed...
the
definitions
of
those
terms...
are
spelled
out
in
great
detail.
and
we
believe
that
the
policy,
therefore,
by
its
narrow
construction
necessarily
leads
to
a
situation
which
was
contemplated
in
turner
v.
safley,
that
there
would
be
a
reasonable
relationship
between
this
action
and
the
legitimate
penalogical
goal.
mr.
william
l.
williams
that
is
a
possibility,
your
honor.
but,
of
course,
for
a
mentally
ill
person
there
is
no
showing
that
that
has
any
treatment
benefit.
it
results
in
warehousing
the
mentally
ill.
it
frustrates
the
legitimate
policy
of
the
special
offender
center
which
is
to
provide
diagnosis
and
treatment
where
it's
available
so
that
inmates
can
be
housed
in
one
of
the
other
12
prisons
which
the
department
of
corrections
administers.
so--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--i
think
it
can
be
considered
but
there
are
risks
in
administering
the
medication.
but
the
risk
to
the
inmate
of
not
administering
it
when
it
is
medically
appropriate
are
equally,
if
not
more,
severe.
further,
even
with
physical
restraints
someone
has
to
apply
the
restraints.
my
clients,
or
their
staffs,
have
to
try
to
provide
food
to
the
patient.
other
inmates,
when
the...
when
the
individual
is
released,
which
has
to
be
sometime
during
the
day,
are
at
risk
of
assaultive
and
threatening
behavior,
such
as
that
as
was
exhibited
by
mr.
harper
in
this...
in
the
case
below.
so,
we
believe
that
it
is...
that
is
a
consideration,
but
it
is
ultimately
a
medical
judgment
and
that
the
medical
model
which
is
utilized
by
the
special
offender
center
is
much
better
geared
to
meeting
the
goal
of
the
due
process
requirement
which
is
ultimately
in
avoiding
or
minimizing
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
decision.
there
are
two
potentially
erroneous
decisions
in
making
these
kind
of
decisions.
one
is
to
administer
medications
to
someone
who
isn't
mentally
ill
or
for
whatever
reason
doesn't
require
them.
the
special
offender
center
policy,
unlike
the
decision
below,
not
only
provides
a
hearing
opportunity
for
that
person
but
also
ongoing
medical
reviews.
there
is
a
requirement...
after
the
initial
hearing
there
is
another
hearing
14
days
later,
and
another
hearing
180
days
and
every
two
weeks
in
between
there
is
a
report
to
the
department
of
corrections'
medical
officer.
so
there
is
some--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--well,
let
me...
let
me
modify
my
answer
slightly.
the
psychiatrists
are
on
contract.
they
are
practicing
psychiatrists
who
contract
to
come
to
the
prison
a
few
days
each
per
week.
so,
in
that
sense,
they
are
paid
by
the
department
of
corrections
but
they're
not
full-time
civil
service
employees
of
the
department
of
corrections.
i
suppose
there
might
be
at
least
a
theoretical
concern.
but
if
you
accept
our
argument
that
it
should
be
a
medical
model,
any
consultant
that
we
review...
we
get
to
review
it,
is
going
to
be
hired
and
paid
for
by
the
department
of
corrections.
and
so
almost
inevitably
there
is
going
to
be
that
kind
of
a
challenge
or
concern.
the
other
point,
of
course--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--not
directly,
your
honor.
the
review
panel
determines
whether
the...
what
has
been
prescribed
by
the
treating
physician
is
appropriate.
now,
i
supposed
that
one
could
possibly--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--absolutely,
your
honor.
and
i
think
one
of
the
possible
outcomes
of
the
review
panel's
decision
is
the
prescribed
medication
is
maybe
not
the
appropriate
one
or
the
dosage
is
not
right,
but
we
recommend
a
low...
a
lower
dosage
or
a
different
medication,
or
something
of
that
nature.
mr.
william
l.
williams
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
except
that
the
initial
hearing
must
be
followed
up
by...
within
14
days
by
a
second
hearing.
and
then
there
are
the
ongoing
medical
reports
to
the
department
of
corrections.
and
what
i
understand
from
the
psychiatric
practitioners
is
that
medical
judgment
is
not
a
snapshot
that
you
take
at
one
time.
it's
an
ongoing
thing
as
the
patient
changes,
progresses
or
fails
to
make
progress,
and
that
the
medications,
the
type
of
medications,
and
the
dosages,
are
changed,
again,
utilizing
the
subtle
nuances,
if
you
will,
of
a
professional
judgment...
medical
judgment
standard.
mr.
william
l.
williams
as
i
understand
the
way
they
work,
they
alter
the
emotional
state
and
try
to
produce
a
more
normative-type
state.
they
do
away
with
hallucinations
and--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--it
is
my
understanding
that
they...
that
the
can
have
that
effect
because
they
overcome
the
hallucinatory...
and
illusionary-type
processes
that
are
often
at
play
with
such
individuals.
mr.
william
l.
williams
that
could
be
the
case.
and,
in
fact,
some
of
the
medical
studies
that
we
have
cited...
and
i
guess
sort
of
a
flip
side
of
that,
which
is
often
the
initial
refusal
to
take
the
medication
is
not
so
much
a
manifestation
of
the
individual's
true
desire
as
a
symptom
or
a
manifestation
of
the
process
of
the
illness
from
which
they
are
suffering.
mr.
william
l.
williams
if
you
accept
the
notion
that
what
he
is
saying
truly
manifest...
manifests
his
will,
that
would
be
true.
but
that
places
too
high
a
risk
upon
my
clients
and
the
other
inmates
for
whom
they
are
responsible
in
trying
to
implement
a
purely
physical
restraint
regiment
when
there
are
mentally
ill
individuals
who
could
benefit
from
the
treatment
which
my
clients
wish
to
provide.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
prefer
to
reserve
the
rest
of--
mr.
william
l.
williams
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
it's
a
two-to-one
vote
unless
the
psychiatrist
member
of
the
panel
votes
against
medication,
and
then
he
controls
it.
mr.
william
l.
williams
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
williams
it
would
not
be
permissible
under
the
soc
policy
because
under
the
soc
policy
you
can
only
be
administered
for
a
treatment
purpose,
and
under
your
hypothetical,
as
i
understood
it,
there
would
be
no
treatment
purpose.
mr.
william
l.
williams
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
a
couple
of
brief
points.
first,
in
response
to
justice
steven's
question
about
the
number
of
prisoners.
as
of
the
date
of
trial,
there
were
25,
i
believe
it
was.
as
of
the
date
of
the
washington
supreme
court
decision,
there
were
nine,
and
today
there
are
seven
who
have
been
through
the
hearings
required
by
the
decision
below.
that's
out
of
the
144
prisoners
at
the
special
offender
center
and
6,000
inmates
throughout
the
washington
department
of
corrections
system.
mr.
william
l.
williams
in
all
seven
that
have
been
brought
at
the
prison
that
has
been
the
result,
your
honor.
and
the
other
point
in
response
to
the
questions
justice
white
had
about
vitek,
it's
true
that
the
decision
there
speaks
in
terms
of
mandatory
behavior
modification,
but
it's
our
understanding
based
upon
one
of
the
amicus
briefs
that
respondent
submitted,
that
treatment
with
antipsychotic
medications
was
contemplated
there.
and
there
is
an
indication
in
the
trial
court
memorandum
decision
which
is
published.
there
is
a
footnote,
i
believe,
that
speaks
to
that
as
well,
your
honor.
mr.
william
l.
williams
well,
i
think
they
may
arguably...
and
if
it
does
involve
medication,
it
may
arguably
involve
different
kinds
of
considerations.
but
the
point
remains
that
the
purpose
in
vitek
was
transfer
for
a
treatment,
and
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
treatment.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
third
point
i
wanted
to
make.
counsel
suggested
that
the
soc
policy
was
not
geared
to
treatment.
the
soc
policy
requires
that
the
medications
be
prescribed
by
a
psychiatrist
or
in
an
emergency
somebody
with
prescriptive
authority
and
confirmed
by
a
psychiatrist
within
24
hours.
and
under
washington
law,
prescribing
medications
for
a
non-therapeutic
purpose
would
be
illegal.
the
final
point.
since
this
is
a
medication
decision,
a
treatment
decision,
and
a
due
process
analysis,
the
question
is
what
process
is
most
likely
to
result
in
the
correct
decision.
and
we
submit
that
having
a
judge
make
the
decision
after
a
full
hearing
which
necessarily
involves
at
a
minimum
delay
and
in
some
instances
appropriate
medical
judgment
denied,
that
that
does
not
meet
the
test
of
due
process.
that
the
medical
model
implemented
in
this
soc
policy
is
more
appropriate
under
the
due
process
analysis.
mr.
william
l.
williams
well,
i
guess
the
response
to
that
is
what
value
does
that
add
to
the
decision-making
process
to
have
a
judge
make
that
decision
when
the
result,
if
he
makes
a
negative
decision
even
though
medical
professional
judgment
indicates
that
the
person
does
constitute
because
of
his
medical
condition
a
threat
to
himself
or
others...
if
one
of
the
outcomes
is
that
the
judge
is
going
to
in
effect
overturn
that
decision,
what
you
have
is
a
judge
interfering
with
the
professional
medical
judgment
which
this
court
has
said
persons
in
custody
are
entitled
to.
i
think
that
the
judge
doesn't
add
anything,
and
it...
and
it
increases
the
risk
that
an
erroneous
decision
not
to
provide
treatment
will
be
made.
