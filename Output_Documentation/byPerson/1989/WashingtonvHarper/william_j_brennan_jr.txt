justice
jr.
--mr.
williams,
i
think
harper
says
that
he's
not
been
involuntarily
medicated
since
1986.
is
that
not
true?
justice
jr.
uh-huh.
i
gather--
--what
i
have
just
represented
to
justice
o'connor
is
not
in
the
record
because
the
record
closed
when
the
trial
took
place
in
1987.
well,
but
i
gather
the
state's
position
was
that
in
any
event
he
had
been
involuntarily
medicated
between
april
'87
and
may
'88.
is
that
right?
justice
jr.
well,
now...
and
since
may
of
'88?
justice
jr.
and
while...
while
there
was
he
involuntarily
medicated?
justice
jr.
and
again
not
involuntarily
medicated
there?
justice
jr.
i
see.
justice
jr.
well,
what
i'm
getting
at
is
whether
this
issue
of
involuntary
medication
is
moot.
