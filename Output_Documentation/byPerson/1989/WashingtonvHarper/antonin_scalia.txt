justice

i'm
not
sure
you...
you
say
a
danger
to
others
is
part
of
the
thing
that
doctors
can
consider
as...
in
connection
with
the
medical
determination.
you've
just
converted
turner
v.
safley
into...
into
a
medical
criterion
rather
than
a
prison
administration
criterion.
you
acknowledge
that
that's
one
of
the
things
that
can
be
considered
in
prescribing
the
medical...
the
treatment,
whether
a
person
would
be
a
danger
to
other...
others.
justice
scalia
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
no,
i
understand.
justice
scalia
he
has
that
luxury
when
he's
responsible
for
himself--
justice
scalia
--to
simply
refuse
treatment.
justice
scalia
but
that...
it
doesn't
necessarily
follow
that
he
has
that
luxury
when...
when
he's
been
duly
convicted
of
a
crime
and
has
become
a
ward
of
the
state
in
an
institution
to
punish
him
for
that
crime.
certainly
that
gives
the
state
some
prerogatives
that
it
does
not
have
in
the
case
of
a
private
citizen
who
may
well
choose
to
refuse
treatment
no
matter
how
much
trcuble
that
may
give
himself
and
other
individuals.
justice
scalia
let's...
let's
see
if
it
helps
to
put
it
in
a
context
where
it's
not
mental
illness
that's
being
treated.
suppose
a
prisoner
has
contracted
leprosy--
justice
scalia
--and
he
decides
i
don't...
i
don't
want
to
be
treated
for
leprosy.
would
the
state
have
no
alternative
but
to
isolate
him
and
not
to
treat
him
for
leprosy?
or
could
the
state
say,
i
don't
care
whether
you
want
to
be
treated
for
it
or
not,
we're
going
to
treat
you?
now,
you
know,
if
you're
out
privately
and
you
want
to...
you
want
to
live
up
on
some
isolated
estate
by
yourself,
i
suppose
you
can
turn
down
treatment.
but
you're
living
in
a
penal
institution;
we
have
no
choice
but
to
treat
you.
couldn't
a
state
do
that?
justice
scalia
all
right.
now,
why
is
mental
illness
different?
justice
scalia
well,
let
me...
let
me
go
back
to
the
leprosy
case.
justice
scalia
suppose
the
institution
has
a
medical
board
examine
the
individual
and
the
medical
board
says
any
reasonable
person
with
this
condition
would
accept
medical
treatment.
there
is
just
no
reason...
the
desire
not
to
have
any
treatment
for
this
leprosy
is
just
irrational,
we
think.
and
both
out
of
concern
for
the
health
of
the
inmate
and
out
of
concern
for
the
orderliness
and
safety
of
the
institution
this
person
should
be
treated.
and
that
is
determined
internally
by
a...
by
a
medical
board
within
the
institution.
that
would
be
no
good?
justice
scalia
i've
told
you
what
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
is.
justice
scalia
it's
sound
medical
treatment.
any
rational
person
would
accept
it.
justice
scalia
i
understand
that.
outside
of
prison
that's
true.
but
this
person
is
in
prison--
justice
scalia
--and
the
prison
makes
that
judgment.
justice
scalia
we
don't
want
to
have
a
special
cell
for
a
leper.
any
reasonable
person
would
accept
medical
treatment.
justice
scalia
we're
going
to
give
this
person
medical
treatment.
can
they
do
that?
justice
scalia
i
don't
think
it
makes
any
difference
what
the
nature
of
the
intrusion
is
so
long
as
i've
posited
that
any
rational
person
would
accept
it.
it
is
a
sound...
unquestionably
sound
medical
determination
that
a
reasonable
person
would
accept.
justice
scalia
no,
you
don't
have
to
be
incompetent
to
be
unreasonable
about
one
thing.
i'm
perfectly
competent
and
i
just
don't
want
medical
treatment.
justice
scalia
the
answer
is
you
could
not
treat
the
leper
in
that
situation--
justice
scalia
--in
your
theory.
justice
scalia
well,
what
is
your
answer?
justice
scalia
that's
right.
i've
said
that.
justice
scalia
i've
said
any
rational
person
would
accept
the
treatment.
what
more
can
i
say?
justice
scalia
so
you'd
still
need
to
go
to
court
in
that
situation?
justice
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
scalia
so,
you
can
treat
him
even
though
he's
competent,
and
even
though
he
doesn't
want
to
be
treated?
right?
i
think
that's
what
you
just
said.
justice
scalia
well,
as
an
original
proposition
i
think
that's...
that's
very
appealing,
and
i
might
agree
with
it,
that
maybe
the
state
shouldn't
have
the
right
to
alter
anybody's
mind
without
the
person's
consent
unless
the
person
is
incompetent
in
the
sense
that
justice
o'connor
was
speaking
of.
but
in
fact
do
you
have
any
idea
whether
that
has
been...
been
the
tradition
in
this
country
in
either...
in
either
penal
institutions
or
mental
institutions?
justice
scalia
of
simply
declining
to
administer
any...
any
psychotropic
drugs
if
the
individual
is
competent
and
refuses
them?
what
has
been
the
practice?
justice
scalia
historically.
justice
scalia
but
you
just
think
that
we
ought
to
adopt
a
rule
that
you
cannot
alter
somebody's
mind
unless...
unless
the
person
is
willing
or
incompetent?
justice
scalia
excuse
me.
get...
we
have...
there's
an
important...
for
commitment
of
people
to
mental
institutions,
not
penal
institutions,
do
you
have
to
be
incompetent
to
be
committed
or
can
you
be
competent
but
a
danger
to
yourself
or
others?
is
that
possible?
justice
scalia
you
don't
have
to
be
incompetent?
justice
scalia
so...
and
i
assume
you
would
apply
the
same
rule
in...
a
fortiori,
in
mental
institutions?
that
somebody
who
is
a
danger
to
himself
or
others
can
be
committed
but
cannot
against
his
will
be
treated?
justice
scalia
so,
this
hearing
that
you're
asking
would
have
to
occur
not
just
in
prisons,
but
in
all...
in
all
mental
institutions
in
all
states
for
anybody
who
has
been
committed
not
for
incompetence
but
just
because
the
person
is
a
danger
to
himself
or
others?
before
all
of
those
people
can
be
treated
by
those
institutions
where
they've
been
committed
for
treatment,
there
would
have
to
be
a
judicial
hearing
with
respect
to
each...
each
treatment?
justice
scalia
well,
no,
but
i
see
no
reason
of
distinguishing
mental
patients
from
prisoners
for
that
purpose.
justice
scalia
mr.
williams,
what
about
just
having
a
judge
make
the
decision
which
the
judge
makes
for
civil
commitment,
not
that...
on
the
details
of
medical
treatment,
but
at
least
a
judicial
decision
that
the
person
is
a
danger
to
himself
or
others?
that
the
person
is
either
incompetent
or
is
a
danger
to
himself
or
others?
that
has
been
the
traditional
necessary
judicial
judgment
before
you
can
get
civil
commitment,
right?
now,
would
you
object
to
that?
