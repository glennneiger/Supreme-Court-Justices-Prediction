chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
88-599,
washington
versus
walter
harper.
mr.
williams.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
have
one
question
i'd
like
to
ask
you,
mr.
williams.
in
your
soc
procedures,
in
order
for
the
drugs
to
administer
is
it
required
for
the...
is
it
required
that
the
consulting
psychiatrist
vote
to
approve
them?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
williams.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
larkin.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
mr.
phillips,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if...
what
if
washington
were
to
say,
all
right,
we
will
go
to
court
and
get
a
determination
that
the
prisoner
in
this
case
was
mentally
incompetent,
and
then
we're
going
to
follow
our
soc
proceedings
from
then
on
as
to
whether
drugs
should
be
administered.
would
that
satisfy
you
or
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
once
the
determination
of
mental
incompetency
has
been
made,
you
don't
object
to
the
treatment
decisions
being
made
administratively?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
would...
would
the
court
need
only
to
determine
once
that
the
guy
was
mentally
incompetent?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so...
but...
but
review
of
the
competence
of
the
individual
or
review
of
the...
review
of
the
treatment
decisions?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
quite
different,
really,
than
my
hypothetical
which
is
a
more
limited
thing.
just
a
one-shot
determination
that
the
person
is
mentally
incompetent.
and
then
if
there
is
a
claim
that
he
has
regained
competence,
you
go
back
to
court.
but
no
court...
no
court
hearings
on
the
treatment
decisions.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
williams...
rather,
mr.
phillips.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
williams,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
williams.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-599,
washington
against
harper
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
