justice
kennedy
does
the...
does
the
review
panel
determine
the
dosage
and
the
type
of
drugs?
justice
kennedy
can
that
be...
can
that
be
altered
after
the
decision
to
medicate
is
approved?
justice
kennedy
but
after
the
review
panel
makes
its
initial
decision,
does
any
change
in
the
dosage
or
the...
type
of
drug
used
have
to
go
back
before
that
panel?
justice
kennedy
now,
these
psychotropic
drugs
alter
the
emotional
state
of
the
individual?
justice
kennedy
do
they
alter
the
cognitive
and
perceptive
faculties
of
the
person?
justice
kennedy
then
either
in
a
lay
sense
or
a
legal
sense
i
take
it
we
could
say
that
his
willingness
or
his
ability
to
make
a
voluntary
decision
to
consent
or
not
to
consent
might
also
be
altered
by
the
drugs
themselves.
justice
kennedy
in
a
sense,
then,
it's
qualitatively
different
from
physical
restraints,
in
that
with
physical
restraints
the
prisoner
at
least
has
his
voluntary
decision,
his
will
respected
at
all
times,
i
take
it,
in
that
he
can
either
consent
to
the
restraints
or
consent
to
drug
use?
justice
kennedy
you
began
by
saying
a
severely
mentally
ill
person.
but
by
hypothesis,
we
are
dealing
here
with
someone
who
has
the
capacity
to
deny
consent
from
the
standpoint
of
exercising
his
voluntary
choice,
do
we
not?
justice
kennedy
well,
doesn't
the
case
come
up
to
us
in
the
context
where
the
man
is
deemed
to
be
competent,
in
the
lay
sense,
of
deciding
whether
he
wants
this
medication
or
not,
and
to
assess
the
benefits
and
the
disadvantages
of
not
having
the
medication?
justice
kennedy
but
he
is
not
so
seriously
mentally
ill
that
if
he
were
a
lay
person
he
could
be
committed.
correct?
justice
kennedy
and
is
that
true
even
if
the
drugs
alter
his
will?
justice
kennedy
so
that
a
competent
person,
over
his
objection--
justice
kennedy
--can
receive
psychotropic
drugs
that
alter
his
will,
if
there
is
a
court
hearing?
that's
your
position?
justice
kennedy
is
your
objection
in
this
case
to
the
fact
that
the
drugs
alter
the
will
or
that
they
have
side-effects
because
i'd
like...
in
order
to
put
that
proposition
to
hypothesize
that
you
have
a
psychotropic
drug
which
has
no
side-effects
but
it
does
alter
the
will.
could
that
be
administered
to
a
competent
person
over
his
objection?
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
it
would
alter
his
cognitive
faculties,
his
emotional
state.
it
would
make
him
very
compliant,
and
after
some
treatments
with
these
drugs
he
would
want
more
because
his
mind
state,
where
he
previously
objected
to
them
was
now
altered.
justice
kennedy
is
it
permissible
to
administer
such
a
drug
to
a
person
against
his
will
if
he's
competent,
in
a
prison
setting?
justice
kennedy
yeah.
justice
kennedy
i
take
it
you'd
agree
that
the
difficulty
of
these
questions
is
a
strong
argument
for
your
position
that
there
should
be
a
court
hearing
initially?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
case
is
before
us
on
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
washington.
it
is
washington
versus
harper.
walter
harper
is
the
respondent.
for
most
of
the
times
since
1976,
he
was
a
prisoner
in
the
washington
state
penal
system.
he
has
been
diagnosed
as
suffering
from
a
mental
disorder
which
causes
him
to
pose
a
likelihood
of
serious
harm
to
others.
it
is
an
accepted
medical
practice
to
treat
persons
with
conditions
like
harper’s
with
antipsychotic
drugs
these
are
sometimes
called
psychotropic
drugs.
the
drugs
in
most
cases
are
an
effective
means
of
treating
some
mental
illnesses,
but
they
may
have
serious
side
effects.
while
in
prison,
harper
accepted
this
treatment
for
a
time,
but
then
objected
to
its
continuance.
he
brought
suit
in
the
washington
state
courts
alleging,
among
other
points,
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
judicial
hearing
before
the
drugs
could
be
administered
to
him
by
prison
officials.
reversing
the
state
trial
court,
the
washington
supreme
court
held
that
a
judicial
hearing
is
required
before
the
drug
treatments
can
continue.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
there
is
an
initial
procedural
point
as
to
whether
or
not
the
case
is
moot,
and
we
hold
that
it
is
not
moot.
we
hold
that
the
written
policy
of
the
washington
prison
officials
governing
the
use
of
these
drugs
does
not
violate
the
due
process
clause.
although
harper
has
a
clear
liberty
interest
in
avoiding
the
unwarranted
administration
of
antipsychotic
drugs,
the
state
has
an
interest
in
providing
a
prison
inmate
with
appropriate
medical
treatment
for
a
mental
illness
which
renders
him
dangerous
to
himself
or
others.
washington’s
written
policy
which
permits
a
dangerous
and
mentally
ill
inmate
to
be
treated
with
antipsychotic
drugs
when
medically
appropriate
is
a
reasonable
means
of
reconciling
the
inmate’s
and
the
state’s
interest.
the
policy
satisfies
the
procedural
requirements
of
the
due
process
clause.
the
decision
is
made
by
a
committee
composed
of
the
prison
psychiatrist
or
psychologist
and
an
administrator,
none
of
them
concurrently
be
involved
in
the
inmate’s
case.
the
decision
is
made
after
a
full
hearing
with
the
prisoner
having
a
knowledgeable
person
to
assist
him
in
presenting
any
objections.
the
decision
to
be
made
here
is
medical
in
nature,
not
judicial.
our
precedents
recognized
that
in
such
cases,
the
state
can
reasonably
decide
that
medical
professionals,
not
judges,
are
the
most
appropriate
decision
makers.
justice
blackmun
has
joined
the
opinion
of
the
court
and
has
filed
a
separate
concurring
opinion;
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justices
brennan
and
marshall
join.
