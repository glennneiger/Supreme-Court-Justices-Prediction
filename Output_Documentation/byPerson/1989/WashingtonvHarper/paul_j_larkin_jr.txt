mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
view,
for
three
reasons,
due
process
allows
psychiatrists
to
make
the
baseline
treatment
decisions
regarding
the
appropriate
clinical
treatment
of
the
severely
mentally
ill
with
antipsychotic
medication.
the
three
reasons
are
as
follows.
first,
for
more
than
35
years
antipsychotic
medication
has
been
widely
recognized
by
the
psychiatric
profession
as
an
acceptable
and
sometimes
the
only
effective
treatment
for
the
seriously
mentally
ill
who
are
either
dangerous,
as
is
respondent,
or
who
are
gravely
disabled.
second,
because
antipsychotic
medication
is
an
appropriate
treatment
for
some
mentally
ill
prisoners,
the
questions
that
arise
in
each
case
involve
quintessentially
medical
judgments
about
the
appropriateness
of
a
particular
medication
or
a
particular
dosage
for
a
specific
prisoner.
and
those
judgments
are
more
likely
to
be
made
far
more
accurately
by
a
physician
than
they
are
by
a
court.
third,
although
we
believe
a
prisoner
has
a
liberty
interest
in
refusing
antipsychotic
medication,
we
also
submit
that
the
state
or
federal
government
has
a
countervailing
interest
in
assuring
that
third-parties
who
are
in
an
institution
are
adequately
protected
from
assault
and
in
helping
to
restore
to
a
person
the
ability
to
function.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
not
always,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
competency
standard
that
the
respondent
has
argued
we
believe
is
inappropriate
for
three
reasons.
first,
as
this
case
illustrates,
a
person
can
be
competent
and
yet
assaultive.
a
competency
standard,
therefore,
if
it
were
adopted
by
this
court,
would
not
adequately
protect
third
parties
from
assault
because
it's
quite
clear
that
respondent
is
seriously
mentally
ill.
he
is
suffering--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
think...
no...
under
a
lay
standard,
because
he
would
be
found
to
be
mentally
ill
and
a
danger
to
others,
he
could
be
committed.
i
think
that's
the
standard
this
court
adopted
in
o'connor
v.
donaldson,
and
it
would
allow
a
person
who
is
mentally
ill
and,
therefore...
and
a
danger
to
others...
not
simply
mentally
ill
but
mentally
ill
and
a
danger
to
others...
to
be
committed.
there
are
people...
the
second
reason
why
an
incompetency
standard
i
think
is
inappropriate
is
that
competency
can
be
cyclical.
a
person
can
alternate
between
states
in
which
he
is
competent
and
which
he
is
not.
and,
therefore,
he
would
alternate
between
instances
in
which
he
could
be
treated
and
in
which
he
couldn't
be
treated
even
if
the
medication
were
necessary
to
render
him
competent.
what
could
happen
in
that
circumstance
is
a
person
would
continually
spiral
towards
a
worsening
medical
condition
and
continuously
be
treated
on
an
emergency
basis
as
the
condition
deteriorated.
and
third,
a
legal...
as
competency
is
a
legal
standard.
it
is
not
necessarily
coincident,
therefore,
with
the
need
to
treat
someone
who
is
gravely
disabled.
for
example,
a
person
can
be
very,
very
severely
depressed...
so
depressed
that
in
a
prison
setting
he
could
be
seen
to
be
easy
prey
by
other
inmates.
that
person,
at
the
same
time,
however,
may
be
able
to
decide
whether
or
not
he
is
willing
to
accept
certain
types
of
treatments.
in
that
context,
it
is
necessary
in
some
cases
to
treat
that
person
to
avoid
him
from
being
assaulted
by
other
people.
that's
not
the
situation
here
because
respondent
himself
was
responsible
for
assaulting
other
people.
but
that
type
of
situation
can
arise.
now,
justice
o'connor
asked
can
restraints
be
used,
perhaps
on
a
person
like
respondent.
restraints
are
only
a
short-term
measure
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
first,
a
person
who
is
under
restraint
can
oftentimes
injure
himself.
he
can
injure
nerves
or
muscles
by
fighting
at
the
restraints.
he
can
become
dehydrated.
he
could
have
a
heart
attack.
secondly,
restraints
don't
treat
the
underlying
mental
illness
that
is
the
cause
of
the
problem.
someone
like
respondent
also
suffers
from
episodic
and
cyclical
episodes
of
violence.
for
example,
some
of
the
evidence
in
some
of
the
biweekly
reports
that
were
conducted
at
the
soc
indicated
that
they
believed
that
there
was
a
two
to
four
month
pattern
of
violence
that
respondent
seemed
to
indicate,
although
it
was...
there
was
an
overlapping
episodic
series
of
violent
assaults
that
could
occur.
in
that
sort
of
circumstance,
it
would
be
impossible
to
predict
when
in
a
particular
instance
a
violent
out...
outburst
might
occur
and
a
restraint,
therefore,
would
be
an
ineffective
means
of
preventing
that
sort
of
circumstance.
so
restraints,
however,
i
might
add,
are
the
type
of
consideration
that
a
physician
or
psychiatrist
should
be
required
to
consider
under
the
professional
judgment
standard
that
this
court
adopted
in
the
youngberg
case.
that
standard
would
require
a
physician
to
decide
amongst
the
acceptable
medical
treatments
by
considering
a
variety
of
factors
such
as
the
prisoner's
past
history,
his
current
mental
status,
his
responsiveness
to
other
types
of
drugs
or
medication,
the
risk
type
and
severity
of
side
effects
that
could
occur,
and
the
prospects
of
gain
from
using
a
particular
treatment.
a
court
can
then
intervene
in
a
particular
case
after
the
fact
just
to
ensure
that
a
physician
exercised
his
professional
judgment.
it
is
not
our
view
that
the
court
should
be
taken
out
of
this
altogether.
it's
our
view
that
psychiatrists
should
serve
as
the
baseline
decision-makers.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no.
i
think
in
factual
cases
there
will
be
a
variety
of
different
circumstances.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
the
same
factual
scenarios
can
arise
in
both
contexts.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
now,
of
course,
in
a
prison
context--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
it
is
a
little
different.
our...
our
ultimate
standard
would
apply
whether
a
person
is
in
a
facility
such
as
the
soc,
or
is
in
a
mental
ward
of
a
hospital,
or
whether
he
is
in
a
psychiatric
institution
in
a
state
or
a
local
government's
care.
in
that
respect,
we
think
the
same
standard
would
apply
across
the
board.
now,
this--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--correct.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
but
a
person
who
is
a
danger
to
others
because,
say,
for
example,
he's
suffering
from
a
delusion
or
hallucination
that
perhaps
the
guards
are
the
devil...
not
a
devil,
but
the
devil...
or
that
people
are
out
to
poison
him,
is
in
a
great
deal
of
distress.
and
to
treat
him
in
order
to--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--prevent
him
from
harming
someone
else
is
not
simply
a
means
of
preventative
restraint.
it
also
treats
the
underlying
mental
illness.
now,
that
problem
can
arise
in
either
a
mental
hospital
or
a
prison
circumstance.
it
may
be
more
likely
to
arise
in
a
prison,
but
our
standard
would
apply
across
the
board.
in
either
case,
you
are
elevating
a
person's
level
of
functioning
and
it,
therefore,
is
a
treatment
decision.
it's
not
simply
a
penalogical
one.
now,
we
think,
although
this
case,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
involves
only
a
prisoner
who
is
assaultive
and
therefore
violent,
is
also
one
in
which
for
a
variety
of
reasons
the
court
may
want
to
address
the
question
of
whether
the
professional
judgment
standard
would
apply
to
persons
who
are
gravely
disabled.
and
we
think
someone
who
is
gravely
disabled
and
therefore
who
is
in
need
of
medical
treatment
for
his
illness
is
also
a
person
who
can
be
treated,
because,
as
my
colleague
pointed
out,
in
some
cases
the
only
alternative
is
a
lifetime
of
institutionalization
for
someone
who
is
severely
mentally
ill,
whether
or
not
he
is
dangerous.
if
he
has
regressed
so
far
that
no
other
treatment
is
effective,
antipsychotic
medication
is
an
appropriate
means
of
helping
to
restore
that
person
to
a
sufficient
level
of
functioning
so
that
he
can
ultimately
leave
an
institution.
or,
even
if
he
cannot,
then
he
can
function
within
that
institution
at
a...
at
an
acceptable
level.
the
competency
standard
that
respondent
has
urged
does
little,
we
think,
to
help
serve
both
of
those
goals,
for
the
reasons
that
i
explained
before.
it
does
nothing
to
help
prevent
the
risk
of
violence.
it
does
not
overlap
at
all
with
the
situation
in
which
a
person
may
need
this
type
of
treatment
in
order
to
receive
the
care
that
is
necessary
in
this
context.
and
it
is
not
one
that
we
think
is
best
applied
in
this
circumstance.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further
to
add.
