justice
o'connor
mr.
williams,
do
you
mind
my
asking
where
mr.
harper
is
now?
justice
o'connor
well,
there
was
some
suggestion,
i
think
by
respondent's
counsel,
that
he
had
been
taken
out
of
the
special
offender
center
and
taken
off
the
medication,
and
that
that
situation
had
continued
for
several
years
and
was
likely
to
remain
the
same.
justice
o'connor
--uh-huh.
justice
o'connor
--was
he
ever
put
back
on
the
medication?
justice
o'connor
is
there
some
possibility
he
could
be
returned
there
again
and--
justice
o'connor
i
suppose
you
could
resort
to
physical
restraints
if
the
problem
was
his
risk
to
other
people
or
himself.
justice
o'connor
but,
of
course,
there
are
certain
risks
to
the
administration
of
the
medication,
and
if
someone
felt
strongly
that
they
didn't
want
to
be
medicated
and
if
you
had
the
alternative
of
isolation
or
restraint,
is
that
something
the
state
should
have
to
consider
in
the
balance?
justice
o'connor
i
guess
you
don't...
you
rely
entirely
on
in-house
personnel
for
the
review
and
the
hearing
and
the
determination.
is
that
right?
justice
o'connor
would
it
be
burdensome
to
require
some
outside
consultant,
or
is
that
even
appropriate
to
think
about?
is
there
a
concern
at
all
that
the
decision
might
be
weighted
heavily
in
favor
of
just
what's
convenient
for
the
institution?
justice
o'connor
but
he
does
have
an
obligation
not
to
injure
other
people.
justice
o'connor
and
i
guess
the
state
has
some
concern
about
his
behavior.
justice
o'connor
but
it
seems
to
me
the
state
has
a
right
to
do
some
of
each.
i
suppose
they
do
have
a
concern
about
treating
people
in
prison
who
are
ill.
justice
o'connor
yeah.
justice
o'connor
what
makes
the
court
better
able
to
decide
that
than
the
medical
practitioners,
and
why
isn't
the
court
totally
reliant
on
the
advise
of
the
medial
practitioners
in
that
situation?
justice
o'connor
well,
in
case
like
youngberg
v.
romeo
this
court
has
held
that
it
can
be...
such
decisions
can
be
made
by
medical
experts.
justice
o'connor
that
a
court
isn't
always
necessary
to...
as
an
intervening
power.
justice
o'connor
well,
involuntary
commitment
is
a
pretty
powerful
liberty
interest
there.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
court
below
thought
if
a
person
is
found
to
be
mentally
ill
or
diseased
and
a
danger
to
himself
or
others,
then
that
individual
can
be
involuntarily
committed
and
involuntarily
treated
if
it's
in
the
best
interests
of
that
person.
i
mean,
that
clearly
was
the
finding
below
and
the
determination
below.
it
didn't
require
a
determination
of
competence.
people
can
be
mentally
ill
and
a
danger
and
committed
even
though
they
might
be
"competent
for
some
purposes".
isn't
that
true?
justice
o'connor
that's
not
what
the
court
said,
of
course,
and
that's
not
the
standard
for
involuntary
commitment
in
washington
state
or
other
states.
