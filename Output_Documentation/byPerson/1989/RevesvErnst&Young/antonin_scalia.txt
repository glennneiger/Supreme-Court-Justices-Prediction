justice

scalia
mr.
mccambridge,
i'm
sure
that
the
purpose
of
this
thing
was
to
exclude
commercial
paper.
but
they
could
have
said
that.
they
could
have
said
it
doesn't
include
commercial
paper.
but
they
said...
well,
i
assume
what
they
said
is
that
that's
going
to
be
very
complicated
and
require
a
case-by-case
examination...
we
will
adopt
a
rule.
it
may
not
be
perfect,
but
it
will
surely
get
virtually
everything
that's
commercial
paper.
it
may
be
rough
at
the
edges.
and
i
think
you're
coming
before
us
with
one
of
the
edges.
i
mean,
maybe
this
isn't
commercial
paper,
but
it
does
fall
within
the
rough
rule
that
this
exception
seems
to
say.
if
it's
less
than
nine
months,
it's
just
not
going
to
be
deemed
an
investment.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
isn't
it
true
that
on
a
literal
reading
even
a
note
with
a
term,
once
the
term
arrives,
it
becomes
a
demand
note
thereafter
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
want
to
rest
on
the
proposition
that
no
demand
note
is
covered
by
the
exception
so
that
case-by-case
we're
going
to
have
to
look
at
demand
notes
to
see
if
they're
investments?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
to
say
that
you're
not
going
to
be
literal
in
one
respect
where
you
obviously
can't
be
literal
is
not
to
say
that
you're
not
going
to
be
literal
in
any
respects,
which
is
what
you
are
urging
upon
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
as
you
point
out,
the
statute
requires
maturity
to
be
determined
at
the
time
of
issuance...
a
maturity
at
the
time
of
issuance
of
not
exceeding
nine
months.
so
you
really
couldn't
wait,
under
the
statute,
to
see
when
it's
cashed
in,
in
order
to
determine.
you
have
to
make
some
judgment
one
way
or
the
other
at
the
outset.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
not
unless
you're
trying
to
get
a
rule
that
the
courts
can
easily
apply.
as
i
understand
your
thesis,
though,
once
we...
if
we
were
to
adopt
the
family
resemblance
test
and
adopt
the
rest
of
your
case,
the
nine-month
provision,
as
it
applies
to
notes,
would
have
no
function
whatever,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
function
would
it
have,
because,
as
you
say,
you
would
just
look
to
see
if
it
has
a
family
resemblance
and
the
nine
months
doesn't
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
what
context
does
that
question
come
up?
how
do
you
have
a
case
that
involves
the
issue
of
whether
a
demand
note
is
mature
upon
its
issuance?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
so
for
everything?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
so
for
everything
covered
by
the
1934
act?
i
mean,
why
couldn't
you
say,
well,
you
just
don't
need
the
1934
act
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that
that's
right,
that
you
would
not
consider
them
securities?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
that's
right,
if
you
can
use
that
introductory
phrase...
i'm
not
sure
it
was
meant
for
that
purpose,
but
if
you
can
use
that
introductory
phrase
to
ignore
the
plain
language
of
the
earlier
portion
of
this
provision,
why
can't
you
use
it
to
modify
the
language
of
the
exception
as
well?
that's
all--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
the
context
language.
justice
antonin
scalia
the...
the
securities
act
definition
of
commercial
paper,
which
we've
been
told
is...
is
the
same
as
the
words
used
here,
it
really
isn't.
the
government
sort
of...
it's
in
footnote
12
of
the
government's
brief,
but
the
government
does
acknowledge
that
in
the
securities
act
there
is
added
to
this...
this
recitation
of
notes
and
so
forth
that
they
have
to
be
used
for
current
transactions.
and
that
language
is
not
contained
in
the
exchange
act.
so,
why...
why
should
one
think
that
the
two
are
meant
to
represent
the
same
thing?
