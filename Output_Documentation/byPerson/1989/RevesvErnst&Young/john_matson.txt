mr.
john
matson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioners
and
the
government
here
want
the
court
to
decide
this
case
without
looking
at
the
plain
language
of
the
1933
act.
if,
as
this
court
has
said,
the
starting
point
is
the
language
of
the
statute
itself,
then
in
this
case
that's
the
ending
point
because
the
statutory
language
is
very
clear.
it
excludes
in
the
1934
act
from
the
definition
of
a
security
notes
which
have
a
maturity
at
the
time
of
issuance
of
not
exceeding
nine
months.
these
demand
notes
fit
squarely
into
that
exclusion.
and,
justice
o'connor,
your
question
earlier
about
maturity,
the
case
law
is
clear
both
nationally
and
in
arkansas,
which
would
apply
here,
that
with
a
demand
note
maturity
is
measured
at
the
time
of
issuance.
in
other
words,
the
demand
note
matures
when
it's
issued.
those
cases
are
cited
at
page
10
of
our
brief.
mr.
john
matson
the
several
arkansas
cases
we
cite
are
statute
of
limitations
cases.
they
certainly
don't
arise
in
this
context.
there
is
no
federal
litigation
involving--
mr.
john
matson
--demand
notes
as
securities,
and
the
courts
have
determined...
and
this
is
a
common-law
rule...
that
when
something
is
on
demand
it
matures
at
the
time
it's
issued.
mr.
john
matson
at
least
not
in
arkansas
and,
as
we
understand,
the
general...
i
don't
know
what,
justice
kennedy,
the
california
particular
rule
is,
but
for
the
purposes
of
these
notes--
mr.
john
matson
--the
date
of
its
issuance.
that
isn't...
this
isn't
a
statute
of
limitations
question.
that's
just
simply
the
source
of
the
body
of
law
that
says
a
demand
note
matures
when
it's
issued.
so,
for
purposes
of
the
statute
in
this
case,
it
has
a
maturity
of
less
than
nine
months.
now--
mr.
john
matson
--i
don't
know,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
matson
it's
never
less--
mr.
john
matson
--i
don't
know
the
answer.
mr.
john
matson
that
was
never...
never
a
question
in
this
case.
but
the
question--
mr.
john
matson
--i
don't
know.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
john
matson
the
issue,
for
purposes
of
this
case--
mr.
john
matson
--because
that
question
never
came
up
was
simply
how
do
you
measure
maturity
for
purposes
of
he
1934
act.
and
the
answer
for
these
demand
notes
is
they
mature
immediately;
therefore,
they're
within
the
nine-month
rule.
mr.
john
matson
well,
the
question...
the
question,
justice--
mr.
john
matson
--the
question,
justice
blackmun,
for
purposes
of
this
case
is
simply
to
measure
maturity
for
purposes
of
that
statutory
language.
the
statutory
language
says
a
maturity
of
less
than
nine
months.
these
have
immediate
maturity.
given
that
fact,
any
other
result
can
occur
only
by
ignoring
the
statutory
language
and
ignoring
legislative
history.
and
what
petitioners
and
the
government--
mr.
john
matson
--yes.
they
are
at
page
10
of
our
brief.
mr.
john
matson
yes.
mr.
john
matson
that
was...
that
was
part
of
the
argument
we
were
making.
to
avoid
this
plain
language
result,
petitioners
and
the
government
would
have
the
court
read
into
the
1934
act
language
that
simply
is
not
there.
and
they
would
have
the
court
do
this
in
two
ways.
either
to
take
an
exemption
from
registration,
what's
been
referred
to
as
the
commercial
paper
exemption,
out
of
the
1933
act
and
read
it
as
if
it
were
in
the
1934
act.
or,
alternatively,
they'd
take
four
words
that
are
in
the
exclusion...
note,
draft,
bill
of
exchange,
bankers
of
acceptance...
and
say
what
congress
really
meant
by
those
four
phrases
was
commercial
paper.
now,
first,
in
the
1934
act
when
congress
wanted
to
refer
to
commercial
paper,
it
did.
this
is
not...
i
apologize...
in
our
brief,
but
in
rereading
the
original
'34
act
in
preparation
for
argument,
the
phrase
commercial
paper
is
there.
it's
in
section
15
of
the
act
where
congress
was
granting
the
sec
authority
for
rulemaking
with
respect
to
certain
market-making
activities
except
for
exempt
securities
and
commercial
paper.
in
other
words,
when
congress
wanted
to
use
the
phrase,
it
knew
how
to
use
it
and
it
did.
would
it
have,
with
that
background,
have
used
note,
draft,
bill
of
exchange
and
bankers
of
acceptance
to
mean
commercial
paper
and
only
commercial
paper
when
elsewhere
in
the
same
statute
it
used
those
words
specifically?
the
two
statues,
the
1934
and
'33
act,
have
very
different
purposes.
the
1934
act
was
adopted
to
regulate
exchanges.
short-term
notes
were
not
traded
on
exchanges.
they
would
not
have
been
subject
to
the
act.
they
were
excluded
from
the
definition.
the
1933
act,
on
the
other
hand,
regulates
the
offering
of
securities.
and
although
at
the
time
the
statutes
were
adopted
short-term
notes
were
not
traded,
they
were
offered.
so
the
1933
act,
with
its
purpose
of
regulating
the
offering
of
securities,
includes
short-term
notes
in
the
definition
and
only
excludes
certain
of
those
notes
from
registration.
the
1934
act,
on
the
other
hand,
with
its
purpose
of
regulating
the
exchanges,
didn't
need
to
address
short-term
notes,
which
simply
were
not
traded.
the
government
also
suggests
that
the
court
ought
to
read
into
the
1934
act
language
that's
not
there
to
prevent
frauds
from
being
committed
with
short-term
instruments.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
the
1933
act
itself
provides
for
the
sec
and
for
the
investing
public
protection
with
respect
to
the
offering
of
short-term
instruments.
there
is
no
reason,
in
other
words,
for
this
court
to
read
into
the
1934
act
language
that
isn't
there
to
protect
the
public
because
for
that
purpose
they're
protected
under
the
1933
act.
mr.
john
matson
i'm
sorry,
justice
white?
mr.
john
matson
at
the
time
the
act
was
adopted,
it
was
focused
on
regulating
exchanges.
the
use
of
the
act
today,
most
specifically
section
10(b),
is
very
different
than
it
was
envisioned
in
1934.
mr.
john
matson
the
real
protection
it
applies
is
for
the
defrauded
seller
who
isn't
protected
under
the
1933
act,
and
that
isn't
the
case
that
we
have
here.
only
if
the
court
rejects
the
plain
language
analysis
we're
making
of
the
1934
act
does
it
have
to
face
the
perplexing
issue
for
the
lower
courts
and
practitioners
and
commentators
of
just
what
notes
are
securities.
it
has
been
universally
accepted
that
some
instruments
denominated
note
are
securities.
the
corporate
capital
note
publicly
offered
and
traded
on
the
exchanges
would
be
thought
by
all
to
be
a
security.
on
the
other
hand,
a
consumer
finance
note,
a
home
mortgage
note,
a
commercial
borrowing
note
were
generally
thought
not
to
be
a
security.
and--
mr.
john
matson
--yes,
that's
right.
mr.
john
matson
the
purpose--
mr.
john
matson
--are
we
talking
about
the
context
language?
mr.
john
matson
well,
take
the
context
language,
justice
scalia,
at
two
points.
one
of
the
ways
that
petitioners
and
the
government
are
trying
to
use
the
context
clause
is
to
say
you
have
to
look
at
the
context
of
the
transaction
and
that's
how
you
get
to
the
commercial
paper
exclusion.
however
the
context
clause
is
used...
and
this
court,
for
example,
in
national
securities
suggested
it
was
statutory
context
not
transactional
context...
would
congress
have
let...
would
congress
have
intended
the
context
clause
to
be
used
in
a
way
where
commercial
paper
is
always
excluded
from
the
definition?
that
wouldn't
be
how
the
context
clause
would
be
used.
if
they
wanted
to
exclude
commercial
paper
from
the
definition,
they
would
have
said
commercial
paper.
the
context
clause
comes
into
play
as
the
statute
is
applied
in
analyzing
certain
transactions.
a
specific
example,
investment
contracts,
which
is
a
term
in
the
definition
of
security,
has
no
particular...
intrinsic
meaning.
you
have
to
look
at
the
context
of
the
transaction.
but
that
isn't
the
starting
point.
the
starting
point
has
to
be
the
statute.
and
taking
the
plain
language
approach
that
we've
taken
to
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
if
you
extended
that
to
say
that
any
note,
home
mortgage
note,
consumer
finance
note,
is
a
security
probably
is
an
absurd
result
and
there
is
a
stopping
point
at
some
place
for
the
plain
language
rule,
that's
one
of
the
stopping
points.
but,
certainly,
since...
since
the
statutes
were
adopted,
it
has
generally
been
accepted
that
not
all
notes
can
be
securities.
the
statute,
after
all,
was
adopted
to
regulate
instruments
commonly
thought
to
be
securities.
a
home
mortgage
note
has
never
been
commonly
thought
to
be
a
security.
so,
the
courts
have
been
faced
with
this
problem.
it's
never
been
before
this
court,
but
the
lower--
mr.
john
matson
--have
struggled
with
how
do
you
differentiate--
mr.
john
matson
--there
certainly
have
been
a
lot
of
cases
that
disagree
with
judge
friendly's
decision
on
exchange--
mr.
john
matson
--on
approach.
mr.
john
matson
yes.
mr.
john
matson
in
john
nuveen,
which
is
really
the
first
of
the--
mr.
john
matson
--cases,
from
john
nuveen
on
there
have
not
been
significant
decisions.
courts
have
never,
in
the
course
of
making
that
analysis,
looked
at
the
statutory
language
of
the
'34
act--
mr.
john
matson
--but
never
looked
at--
mr.
john
matson
--they've
never
looked
at
the
history--
mr.
john
matson
--in
terms
of
the--
mr.
john
matson
--1934
act
provision.
the
focus
has
always
been
on
the
'33
act
and
it's
ignored
the
second
purpose
of
the
'34
act,
that
is,
to
regulate
exchanges.
it
hasn't
focused
on
the
statutory
language.
but,
no,
i
think
that
distinction
can
be
drawn.
at
one
point
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
says
in
the
exclusion
if
the
note
has
a
maturity
of
less
than
nine
months,
then
it's
not
a
security.
if
you
tried
to
apply
that
same
approach
to
bring
home
mortgage
notes
in,
then
i
think
you...
you
break
the
bounds
of
the
plain
language
rule.
but
the
two
can
be
consistently
applied.
mr.
john
matson
well,
i
think
our
argument
is
that...
the
context
clause
focuses
on
statutory
context.
mr.
john
matson
in
the
first--
mr.
john
matson
--in
the
first
instance.
and
the
focus
of--
mr.
john
matson
--the
focus...
maybe
this
focus
helps.
we
know
that
the
purpose
of
the
adoption
of
the
federal
securities
laws
was
to
regulate
those
instruments
commonly
thought
to
be
securities.
mr.
john
matson
the
capital
note
example
i
gave
you
would
be
commonly
thought
to
be
a
security.
mr.
john
matson
the
home
mortgage
note
would
not
be.
but
that
same
analysis
i
don't
believe
applies
when
you're
dealing
with
the
exclusion
because
there
you're
dealing
with
a
congressional
decision
that
these
instruments
were
not
traded
on
exchanges;
therefore,
they
did
not
need
to
be
part
of
the
exclusion.
there
have
been
arguments
at
times...
there
is
an
amicus
argument
in
this
case
from
the
state
securities
administrators
that
seems
to
suggest
that
home
mortgages,
consumer
notes,
and
the
like,
would
be
securities.
that's
a
very
rare
argument.
and
where
the
state
securities
administrators
get
to
that
is
trying
to
take
the
family
resemblance
test,
which
petitioners
and
the
government
advocate,
taking
that
test
and
saying
that
ought
to
be
applied
much
more
broadly.
and
that's
one
of
the
dangers,
one
of
the
flaws
of
that
test...
is
that
it
has
no
articulated
rationale.
it
is
a
definition
by
default,
as
articulated
by
judge
friendly.
mr.
john
matson
the...
the
demand
note
issue
has
never--
mr.
john
matson
--no.
because
the
issue
has
never
been
before
the
court
of
appeals.
arguably
there's
been
one
demand
note
case
ever
in
a
court
of
appeals
and
that
was
the
zeller
case
in
the
second
circuit
and
they
didn't
focus
on
this
issue
because
of
the
peculiar
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
john
matson
no,
but
once
again,
i
don't
believe
there
are
district
court
cases
involving
demand
notes.
we
have
a
very
unusual
instrument
here
and
while
the
issues
that
this
case
presents
are
important
in
the
broader
range
for
many
of
the
other
notes
that's
traded,
there
is
little
use
of
demand
notes
as
we
have
seen
them.
and
we
have
suggested
that
the...
that
the
test
the
court
should
use
as
they
distinguish
between
the
notes
that
are
securities
and
the
notes
that
aren't
follows
from
this
court's
landreth
decision
where
it
set
up
a
two-stage
test.
the
court
said,
first
we'll
look
at
the
characteristics
of
the
instrument
and
see
if
it
has
the
characteristics
of
a
security
of
that
name.
and
if
it
does
not,
then
we
will
treat
it
as
an
unusual
instrument
under
this
court's
howey
test.
so,
it's
a
test
that
operates
in
two
stages.
it
comes
from
the
statute.
it
comes
from
this
court's
decisions.
it
draws
on
40
years
of
case
law
that's
build
up
around
the
howey
decision.
and
it's
a
more
positive
and
predictive
test
than
the
family
resemblance
test.
the
court
in
landreth
was
speaking
only
to
stock.
the
same
issue
had
been
in
forman
ten
years
earlier,
which
was
also
a
stock
case.
but
the
courts
of
appeals
since
landreth
have
applied
it
to
other
enumerated
instruments,
and
it's
a
workable
test
for
all
the
various
enumerated
instruments
in
addition
to
stock.
and
if
the
court
applies
landreth
to
notes,
what
it
will
have
given
the
lower
courts
and
practitioners
is
one
framework
in
which
all
what
is
a
security
questions
can
be
answered
rather
than
a
series
of
different
tests
for
different
types
of
securities.
the
other
tests
that
have
been
offered
to
the
court
are
not
as
grounded
in
the
statute
as
this.
they
don't
come
out
of
this
court's
decisions,
and
they
are
rigid
in
application.
for
example,
the
most
predominant
of
the
lower
court
tests
says
an
instrument
must
be
either
a
commercial
instrument
or
it's
an
investment
instrument.
that's
a
terribly
difficult
analysis
with
something
like
these
demand
notes
which
analytically
don't
logically
fall
into
either.
the
investment
commercial
test
also
gets
to
the
result
by
simply
having
a
laundry
list
of
factors
from
which
a
court
can
select,
greatly
reducing
any
predictive
value
of
the
test.
the
family
resemblance
test
which
is
advanced
by
the
petitioners
and
the
government,
as
i
said,
has
no
articulated
rationale.
it
really
is
a
definition
by
default.
it
says
if
it's
not
like
these
six
or
seven
instruments,
then
it's
a
security
and
that
creates
the
danger
of
either
you're
going
to
apply
those
rigid
items
or
a
judge
is
free
to
do,
if
you
will,
as
the
securities
administrators
say,
whatever
appeals
in
a
particular
case,
and
that
deprives
the
test
of
its
predictive
value.
now,
going
back
to
the
landreth
test
that
we
advance
in
this
case.
the
characteristics
we
would
be
talking
about
for
a
note
would
be
the
characteristics
of
instruments
that
are
unquestionably
securities
and
can
be
called
either
capital
notes,
bonds,
debentures.
they're
all
very
similar.
they
have
these
common
characteristics:
they
tend
to
be
long-term,
they're
often
publicly
traded,
they
have
elaborate
documentation
surrounding
them
and
they
are
perceived
by
users
as
being
securities,
which
this
court
has
said
on
several
occasions
is
an
important
factor
in
evaluating
whether
something
is
a
security.
now,
applying
that
to
these
demand
notes.
they're
certainly
not
long-term.
they
were
demand
instruments.
they
were...
they
wouldn't
have...
they
were
not...
they
would
not
have
been
publicly
traded.
you've
seen
the
stationery
store
form
that
they're
based
on.
and
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
they
were
perceived
by
the
co-op
members
that
held
them
as
being
securities,
no
perception
that
the
benefits
of
the
securities
laws
followed
them.
so,
not
having
the
characteristics
of
those
notes
and
similar
instruments
that
are
undoubtedly
securities,
the
landreth
test
then
goes
to
the
second
stage,
the
howey
test,
which
this
court
said
in
landreth
was
the
appropriate
test
for
all
unusual
instruments,
which
these
demand
notes
certainly
appear
to
be.
howey
focuses
the
test
this
way.
on
whether
the
instrument
is
an
investment
in
a
common
enterprise
made
with
the
expectation
of
profit
solely
from
the
efforts
of
others.
here
something
payable
on
demand
doesn't
carry
with
it
the
element
of
risk
that
is
inherent
in
the
concept
of
investment.
what
happened
to
these
demand
note
holders...
the
co-op
went
into
bankruptcy...
is
exactly
the
risk
that
anyone
has
where
there
is
an
obligation
to
do
something
in
the
future.
and
that's
true
whether
it's
a
co-op
paying
on
demand
notes
or
whether
it's
a
corporation
honoring
a
service
contract
on
an
automobile
or
a
washing
machine.
and
that
is
contrasted
by
this
court's
forman
decision,
for
example,
with
the
kind
of
risk
of
market
fluctuation
that
we
tend
to
associate
with
securities.
so,
at
the
first
level--
mr.
john
matson
--the
interest
rate
was
moved
by
the
co-op
in
accordance
with
the
money
markets.
but
the
interest
rate
constantly
would
change
periodically
and
an
investor
could
immediately
demand
their
money
if
they
didn't
like
where
the
co-op
had
moved
the
interest
rate.
so,
there
isn't
the
kind
of
market
risk
there
where
somebody,
for
example,
is
locked
into
an
interest
rate
over
a
long
term
or
watches
the
value
of
capital
appreciate
or
depreciate.
it's
simply
the
concept...
the
right
to
immediate
payment
is
at
odds
with
the
concept
of
investment.
similarly,
with
the
portion
of
the
howey
test
that
speaks
to
expectation
of
profit
through
the
efforts
of
others,
this
court
has
dealt
on
several
occasions
with
what
profit
means
in
a
securities
law
context.
and
it
has
said
profit
refers
to
either
capital
appreciation
or
earnings
as
in
the
sense
of
dividends.
now,
an
economist
could
define
profit
very
broadly.
probably
benefits
that
i
wouldn't
even
think
of.
but
for
securities
law
purposes,
the
court
has
focused
on
the
kind
of
profit
one
expects
with
a
securities
instrument.
and
that
the
court
identified,
for
example,
in
forman
as
either
capital
appreciation
or
earnings
in
the
form
of
dividends.
in
the
court's
weaver
decision,
the
court
dealt
with
an
interest-bearing
instrument
and
it
distinguished
for
this
purpose
that
instrument
from
the
one
before
the
court
in
the
tcherepnin
case
which
were
withdrawable
capital
shares
that
paid
dividends.
the
court
drew
that
context,
that
with
dividends
there
was
the
earnings
of
the
entity,
the
anticipation
of
that,
that
didn't
exist
where
what
was
being
paid
simply
was...
simply
was
interest.
mr.
john
matson
we
don't
know
of
any
cases
where...
an
instance
where
somebody
tendered
a
note
for
payment
and
wasn't
paid.
so
that
issue
was
never
involved
in
the
case
we
had
below
which
was
basically--
mr.
john
matson
--a
securities--
mr.
john
matson
--it
also
suggests,
justice
o'connor,
that
this
is
not
a
securities
instrument.
in
a
lending-type
note,
that's
not
uncommon
language
to
find.
that
if
you
don't
pay
when
due
or
when
demand,
you
pay
attorney's
fees.
i
can't
ever
remember,
in
a
case
or
otherwise,
seeing
that
kind
of
language
attaching
to
a
securities
instrument.
it
may
be
possible
in--
mr.
john
matson
--very
special
situations.
mr.
john
matson
they
were.
mr.
john
matson
and
what
the...
no
one
knows
the
source
of
that
ad.
this
program
lasted
some
25
years
and
that
ad,
in
a
very
similar
form,
what's
at
page
5
of
the
joint
appendix,
appeared.
now,
first,
the
characterization
by
the
cooperative
of
these
notes
as
investments
can't
be
determinative
of
the
definitional
question.
further,
investment
can
mean
a
lot
of
things.
we
invest
in
gold.
we
invest
in
art.
we
invest
in
houses.
those
aren't
securities.
in
this
case
the
members
of
the
co-op
were,
we
understand,
by
and
large
farmers
in
the
van
buren
area
who
used
the
co-op
as
one
uses
agricultural
co-ops.
that
is,
they
sold
the
grain
they
produced
through
the
co-op;
they
bought
their
supplies
from
the
co-op.
so
they
were
part
of
the
co-op
for
all
those
normal
purposes.
the...
the
advertisement,
which
is
an
advertisement...
is
a
notice...
i
don't
quite
know.
but
it
appeared
only
in
the
co-op's
newsletter.
so
the
question
earlier
about
the
public...
yes,
there
were
1,600
note
holders.
we
understand
most
of
them
were
members
of
the
co-op
and
there's
a
certain
logic
to
that
because
if
the
notice
about
the
notes
appears
only
in
the
co-op's
newsletter
that
goes
to
the
co-op's
members,
those
are
going
to
be
primarily
the
people
who
see
the
note.
the
only
individuals
who
are
identified
in
the
case
who
were
not
members
were
people
who
do...
did
business
with
and
were
familiar
with
the
co-op.
so,
the
characterization
simply
can't
be
dispositive,
nor
can
the
fact
that
there
were
1,600
holders
of
the
note.
this
court
in
its
forman
decision
dealt
with
an
instrument
that
was
held
by
15,000
people,
that
it
held
what
was
labeled
stock
was
not
a
security.
in
the
court's
landreth
decision,
it
dealt
with
an
instrument
that
was
held
by
one
person
and
it
was
a
security.
the
securities
laws
were
never
intended,
as
this
court
has
said,
to
regulate
all
fraud.
and
the
number
of
people
who
may
hold
an
instrument
can't
be
determinative
of
that
question.
in
this
instance
we're
dealing
with
the
securities
exchange
act
of
1934.
protection
comes
to
people
who
hold
short-term
securities
fully
under
the
securities
act
of
1933.
in
this
case,
because
short-term
notes
were
not
traded,
there
was
no
need
definitionally
under
the
1934
act
to
include
short-term
notes.
so,
the
statute
excludes
from
the
definition
all
notes
with
maturity
of
less
than
nine
months,
which,
whatever
other
anomalies
there
may
be
with
demand
instruments,
seems
clear
under
at
least
the
law
that
we've
offered...
and
there's
been
none
offered
on
the
other
side...
that
demand
is
immediate
and...
i'm
sorry,
there
is
a
suggestion
in,
i
believe
it's
the
government's
brief,
that
in
a
1961
sec
release
on
commercial
paper
they
suggested
that
demand
was
not
immediate
maturity.
they
based
that
on
a
federal
reserve
position
taken
years
earlier.
the
fed,
in
1966,
reversed
that
position.
the
fed
has
said
since
1966,
demand
instruments
have
immediate
maturity.
the
sec
has
simply
not
had
occasion
to
revisit
it.
so,
whether
one
looks
at
state
law,
as
we
believe
is
appropriate
here,
or
to
those
analogous
sources
of
federal
law,
would
suggest
that
the
demand
notes
maturing
upon
issuance
are
squarely
within
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
the
plain
language
should
be
applied
to
exclude
these
instruments
from
the
definition.
mr.
john
matson
under
the
statutory...
under
the
exclusion
language,
yes.
if
the
note
is
more
than
nine
months,
it
would
not
be
covered
by--
mr.
john
matson
--by
the
exclusion.
and
then
we
would
go
to
the
other
analysis
we
talked
about,
what
is
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
was
the
instrument
intended
to
be
a
security?
a
straight
commercial
bank
note
would
not
be
another
type
of
note...
would
be
analyzed,
we
suggest,
under
the
landreth
test,
the
two
stages,
to
determine
if
it
is
a
security.
thank
you
very
much.
