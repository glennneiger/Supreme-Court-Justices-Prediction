what's
the
maturity
date
of
a
demand
note?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
a
general
case
law
to
the
effect
that
a
demand
note
is
mature
on
issuance,
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
general
field
of
bills
and
notes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
you
think
the
purpose
was
of
the
exclusion
by
congress
of
notes
with
a
maturity
date
of
less
than
nine
months?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
there
were
a
note
due
and
payable
in
six
months
that
was
for
investment
purposes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
notwithstanding
the
language
in
the
statute,
which
is
rather
clear.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
that
test,
what
would
guide
judges
in
knowing
what's
on
the
list
of
family
resemblances?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
just
what
congress
should
have
included
if
it
had
made
a
list?
i
mean,
what
stands
behind
that
list?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
language
of
the
statute
is
a
starting
point,
then
what
about
the
effect
of
a
maturity
date
of
less
than
nine
months?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
matson--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
matson--
--may
i
interrupt
you
with
that
argument?
if
you
rely
on
the
kind
of
the
consensus
at
the
bar
and
the
consensus
among
the
lower
courts
to
get
home
mortgage
notes
out
of
the
plain
language
of
the
first
part,
don't
you
have
precisely
the
same
consensus,
at
least
among
the
courts
of
appeals
and
the
bar,
on
the
nine-month
exclusion?
have
there
been
any
cases
that
disagreed
with
the
seventh
circuit
decision
in
1972
in
the
john
nuveen
case
or
judge
friendly's
case
in
1976?
haven't
all
the
courts
of
appeals
been
consistent
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
matson,
has
any
court
of
appeal
adopted
your
position
with
regard
to
demand
notes?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes
or
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
any
district
court
adopted
it...
your
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
matson,
these
notes
had
language
in
them
to
the
effect
that
if
they
weren't
paid
at
maturity,
attorney's
fees
would
be
recoverable
and
included.
that
suggests,
at
least,
that
maturity
is
when
an
actual
demand
for
payment
is
made.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--we
have
to
look
at
the
notes
and
determine
what
they
are
and
what
was
intended.
and
i...
it...
it
suggests,
at
least,
a
version
of
understanding
that
for
these
notes
the
maturity
was
when
the
demand
was
made.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
were
certainly--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--they
were
certainly
advertised
as
investment--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--obligations.
