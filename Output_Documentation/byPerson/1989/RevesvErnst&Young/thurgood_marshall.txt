justice
marshall
in
this
case,
we
hold
that
certain
promissory
notes
payable
on
demand
and
securities
within
the
meaning
of
this
securities
act
of
1934.
the
act’s
exclusion
for
certain
short-term
notes
does
not
apply
in
this
type
of
case.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
therefore
reversed.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
the
chief
justice
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part
in
which
justice
white,
justice
o’connor,
and
justice
scalia
have
joined.
