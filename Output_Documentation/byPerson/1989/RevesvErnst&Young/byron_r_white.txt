what
was
the
money
raised
for?
operating
funds?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
how
did
they
sell?
justice
byron

white
how
did
they
sell?
did
they
just--
justice
byron
r.
white
--didn't
they
advertise?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
they
use
any
kind
of
an
agency
to
sell
them?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
can
say
the
people
made
their
own
co-op
directly
at
the
outlet?
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
think
that.
a
note
involves
an
obligation
to
pay
some
money,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron

on
demand.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
be
arguing
the
same
if
there
were
some
bank
that
was
willing
to
supply
working
capital
to
this
co-op
and
every
month
advanced
money
to
them?
or...
if
there
were
just
a
single
lender,
would
you
be
thinking--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
it
was
still
securing
its
working
capital
through
these
notes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
if
something
is
called
a
note
on
its
face,
it
is
presumed
to
be
a
security?
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
but
then
you
run
to
the
exclusion...
to
the
exclusion
which
overcomes
that
presumption
with
respect
to
short-term
notes?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
he
has
to
prove
that
in
this
context
the
exclusion
just
doesn't
apply?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
on
your...
on
your
reading
of
the
exclusion
a
commercial
paper
or
a
bank
loan
of
more
than
nine
months
would
be
covered?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
not
be
excluded?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
two
courts
decide
that
did
deal
with
the
demand
note?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
were
not
excluded
by
them?
