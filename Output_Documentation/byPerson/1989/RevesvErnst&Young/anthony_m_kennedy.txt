do
you
have
any
statistics
on
the
number
of
non-members...
percentage
of
notes
that
were
sold
to
non-members,
as
opposed
to
members?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
anything
to
indicate
that
the
number
of
notes
sold
to
non-members
was
substantial
or
significant,
or
any
finding
like
that
at
all?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
thought
that...
maybe
it's
just
my
california
experience,
but
i
had
thought
the
rule
was
just
the
opposite,
that
the
statute
of
limitations
begins
to
run
from
the
time
a
demand
is
made.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so,
in
arkansas
the
statute
of
limitations
on
a
demand
instrument
runs
from
the
date
of
its
issuance?
