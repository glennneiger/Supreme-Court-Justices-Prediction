justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
88-1480,
bob
reves
v.
arthur
young
&
company.
mr.
mccambridge.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
name
of
the
city
in
which
the
co-op
was
located?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
their
face
they
were
a
loan,
were
they
not?
it
said
that
on
their
face,
they
were
notes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
have
the
exceptions
been
construed
in
the
light
of
that
introductory
phrase?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
this
court
ever
done
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
mccambridge.
mr.
lazerwitz.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why?
you
know,
it
says
note.
why
on
earth
would
one
draw
the
inference
when
congress
says
a
note
with
a
maturity
of
less
than
nine
months
you
would
draw
the
opposite
inference,
that
they
had
something
else
in
mind?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
a
very
strange
way
to
describe
it
since
"note"
is
a
generic
term.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
also,
a
note
covers
more
than
commercial
paper.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazerwitz.
mr.
matson,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
was
some
market
fluctuation
here
on
interest
rates,
wasn't
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
matson.
mr.
mccambridge,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
did
all
of
them
say
that
this
type
of
note
was
not
within
the
nine-month
exclusion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mccambridge.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-1480,
reves
against
ernst
&
young
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
