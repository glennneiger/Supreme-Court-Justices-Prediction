mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
uninsured
demand
notes
which
were
advertised
as
investments
and
purchased
by
thousands
of
ordinary
people
for
more
than
$10
million
are
securities.
under
any
proper
application
of
the
1934
act,
these
notes
are
securities
and
their
purchasers
are
protected.
let
me
briefly
touch
the
facts.
these
notes
were
sold
by
the
farmer's
co-op
of
arkansas
and
oklahoma
for
more
than
25
years.
they
were
uninsured
and
unsecured.
the
co-op
is
not
a
regulated
financial
institution.
it's
not
a
bank;
it's
not
a
savings
and
loan.
it's
in
the
business
of
buying
and
selling
farm
products.
over
25,000
people
were
solicited
every
month.
they
were
told
in
prominent
advertisements,
"this
is
an
investment
program.
"
"these
notes
are
investments.
"
"buy
these
notes
as
investments.
"
the
notes
paid
a
variable
rate
of
interest
which
was
adjusted
every
month
by
the
co-op's
management.
the
notes
were
sold
to
members
of
the
co-op
and
to
non-members.
let
me
make
a
point
on
the
membership.
to
be
a
member
of
the
co-op
cost
nothing
more
than
$5.00.
a
simple
$5.00
payment.
about
half
the
people
in
the
local
community
were
members
of
the
co-op.
at
the
time
of
the
bankruptcy
of
the
co-op,
1,685
people
held
notes
which
they
had
purchased
for
over
$10
million.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
the
money
was
used
both
in
the
day-to-day
operation
of
the
co-op
and
to
make
some
capital
purchases.
there
was
no
identification
in
the
advertisements
as
to
the
purpose
for
which
the
funds
would
be
used.
let
me
turn
to--
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
--there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
delineate
the
exact
division.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
well,
the
finding
by
the
court
was
a
general
finding
that
the
notes
were
offered...
i'm
sorry...
sold
to
the
public.
in
terms
of
how
many
of
those
purchasers
were
also
members
of
the
co-op,
there
is
no
precise
record.
again,
to
be
a
member
of
the
co-op,
it's
a
$5.00
purchase.
this
was
a
rural
community
and
the
co-op
operated
feed
stores
and
things
like
that.
so,
someone
would
buy
a
membership
for
$5.00,
because
at
the
end
of
the
year
you
could
get
a
patronage
dividend
if
your
purchases
were
sufficient.
the
population
of
the
community
in
which
the
co-op
had
outlets
and
was
headquartered
was
about
70,000...
23,000
people
were
co-op
members.
if
you
add
in
members
of
their
families,
et
cetera,
you
could
almost
say
that
the
general
public
and
the
membership
of
the
co-op
was
almost
coextensive.
but,
in
direct
response,
justice
kennedy,
to
your
question,
it
is
not
absolutely
clear.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
van
buren,
arkansas,
and
it
had
outlets
in
three
cities
in
oklahoma.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
people
would
come
to
an
outlet
of
the
co-op.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
yes,
they
were
advertised.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
no,
they
were
sold
directly
by
the
co-op.
the
advertisement
is
at
page
4
of
the...
i'm
sorry,
page
5
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
substantially
the
same
advertisement
appeared
in
every
issue,
every
month.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
well,
we
think
not,
your
honor.
there
was
no...
these
investments,
or
these
sales
of
demand
notes,
were
never
advertised
as
a
loan.
they
were
never
described
as
a
loan.
the
co-op
never
said,
please
loan
us
your
money.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
notes?
yes,
that's
what
it
said.
and
notes
can
be
either
investments--
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
--this
is
an
obligation
to
pay
money.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
on
demand.
that
was
offered
and
solicited
from
members
of
the
general
public,
25,000
people
every
month,
advertised
as
an
investment.
in
our
view,
the
difference...
the
critical
difference
here
is
going
to
be
whether
these
were
investment
transactions
or
simple
commercial
loans.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
a
demand
note
has
no
maturity
date.
the
exclusion
relied
upon
by
arthur
young...
if
the
court
were
to
accept
arthur
young's
invitation
to
read
it
absolutely
literally...
the
demand
notes
would
not
be
covered;
they
are
not
mentioned
in
the
exclusion.
and,
in
fact,
the
record
in
this
case
indicates--
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
--no.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
a
demand
note
can
be
presented
for
payment
immediately.
it
has
no
definite
maturity
date.
the
effect
of
that
is
that
there
is
no
single
date
upon
which
people
would
present
them
for
payment.
it
was
up
to
the
purchaser
and
the
holder,
really,
to
decide
when
to
present
them.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
the
purpose
of
the
exclusion
was
to
exclude
commercial
paper
not
offered
to
the
public.
and
the
basis
for
that
conclusion
is--
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
--we
believe
that
a
note
offered
as
an
investment
and
widely
sold
with
a
six-month
maturity
would
be
a
security.
it
would
not
be
excluded
by--
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
--well,
your
honor,
the
statute
has
a
couple
of
things
that
are
pertinent.
number
one
is
the
introductory
phrase,
"unless
the
context
otherwise
requires",
which
has
been
interpreted
consistently
by
this
court
and
others
to
require
an
investigation
into
the
circumstances
of
the
transaction
to
see
whether
regulation
or
treatment
of
the
instrument
as
a
security
would
fulfill
or
would
be
necessary
to
satisfy
congress'
purpose
to
protect
investors.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
every
lower
court...
federal--
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
--this
court
has
not
addressed
this
specifically.
the
cases
to
which
i
refer
are
cases
dealing
with
the
definition
of
a
security
in
which
this
court
has
expressly
investigated
the
context
of
the
transaction
to
see
whether
defining
the
instrument
as
a
security
would
be
consistent
or
required
by
congress'
purpose
to
regulate
investors.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
well,
the
first
point.
i'd
like
to
bring
you
back
to
the
fact
that
on
an
absolutely
literal
reading,
which
i
think
is
what
you're
talking
about,
demand
notes
are
not
mentioned.
second--
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
--i
think
that
the
statute
says
at
the
time
of
issuance
and
deals
with
notes
with
fixed
terms.
and
you
can
see
from
the
record
here
that
purchasers
will
treat
demand
notes
in
a
variety
of
ways.
sometimes
they
may
be,
as
arthur
young
argues,
more
like
a
short-term
note.
other
times,
more
like
a
long-term
note.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
i
don't
think
a
literal
reading
is
the
proper
reading.
i
think
that
the
proper
reading
is
that
to
conclude
that
the
exclusion
means
commercial
paper
not
offered
to
the
public
as
a
general
matter...
that's
the
proper
way
to
approach
this.
and
then
to
examine
notes...
other
notes...
with
an
eye
towards
determining
whether
they
are
investments
or
commercial.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
i
am
suggesting
that
the
explicit
language
of
the
statute
requires...
congress'
language...
requires
an
examination
of
context.
and
the
reason
that
congress
requires
that
is
because,
as
this
court
has
noted
in
several
cases,
there
is
a
need
to
be
flexible
in
this
area
to
both
effectuate
congress'
purpose
and
to
deal
with
the
many
different
sorts
of
financial
instruments
which
promoters
devised
to
separate
people
from
their
money,
which
is
what
happened
here.
this
court
ha
indicated
in
the
securities
industry
association
case
in
dicta
that
the
exclusion
about
which
we
are
talking
now
is
an
explicit
exception
for
commercial
paper.
and
the
definition
used
by
congress
came
from
the
federal
reserve
board
and
investment
bankers
who
were
absolutely
clear
when
they
appeared
before
congress.
they
said,
this
is
about
commercial
paper;
we
want
an
exemption
for
commercial
paper.
and
they
persuaded
congress
that
that
would
be
appropriate
because,
they
said,
commercial
paper
is
not
generally
available
to
the
public.
it's
not
sold
to
the
public,
it's
not
offered
to
the
public.
they
said
you
and
i...
in
talking
to
the
members
of
congress...
we
are
not
going
to
lose
any
money
if
we
buy...
if
this
exclusion
goes
in
because
we
do
not
buy
commercial
paper.
these
are
for
sophisticated
professionals.
on
the
literal
point...
let
me
turn
to
the
effect
of
the
test
as
proposed
by
arthur
young.
arthur
young
does
want
this
read
absolutely
literally,
except
for
the
demand
note
point
which
i've
already
noted.
and
arthur
young's
conclusion
is
that
the
only
thing
that
matters
is
maturity.
context
doesn't
matter.
congress'
purpose
doesn't
matter.
how
they
are
advertised
doesn't
matter.
whether
people
buy
them
as
investments
doesn't
matter.
the
only
thing
that
is
of
any
concern
is
this
nine-month
bright
line
test.
and
every
lower
court
which
has
taken
a
look
at
this
has
said
that's
a
perverse
result
which
would
be
at
odds
with
the
purpose
of
this
statute.
specifically,
every
three-year
note
which
a
consumer
issues
in
connection
with
his
purchase
of
a
car
would
be
a
security,
subject
to
regulation,
while
public
offerings
of,
say,
45-day
investment
notes,
which
is
exactly
the
scheme
that
ponzi
used
in
the
'20s
in
boston...
45-day
notes
publicly
offered
as
investments...
would
be
unregulated.
the
analysis
that
this
court
has
used
in
all
of
its
decisions
concerning
the
proper
definition
of
a
security
has
been
to
give
effect
to
what
congress
was
trying
to
do.
in
this
case,
these
are
securities
and--
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
--yes.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
yes.
what
happened,
they
issued
a
note
with
whatever
the
quoted
rate
at
the
time
was,
but
in
practice
and
in
the
advertisement,
the
co-op
would
change
in
response
to
market
conditions.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
up
or
down.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
well,
i
think
that
arthur
young
is
right
on
one
thing.
these
probably
were
purchased
in
a
stationery
store,
or
something
like
that.
there's
no
record
evidence
of
it.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
it,
"demand"
seems
to
be
inserted--
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
--by
the
co-op.
so
what
i
think
is
that
they
were
trying
to
say
that
these
are
demand
notes
and
the
fact
that
it
has
some
printed
language
referring
to
maturity,
i
don't
think
is
significant.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
in
fact,
that's
what
happened
here.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
more
than
80
percent
of
the
notes
purchased
were
not
redeemed
within
the
succeeding
year.
the
record
upon
which
the
lower
court
decided
this
on
summary
judgment
included
dozens
of
affidavits
from
note
holders
saying,
you
know,
we
used
our
life's
savings
to
buy
these.
we
thought
they
were
investments,
we
treated
them
as
long-term
investments.
that's
what
they
were
to
us.
and
there's
no
evidence
of
any
short-term
redemptions.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
on
that
point.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
if
there
is
a
maturity,
and
there
is
none
with
demand
notes.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
justice
o'connor,
nine
courts
of
appeals
have
rejected
arthur
young's
test
on
short-term
notes.
no
court
of
appeals
has
accepted
it.
two
courts
of
appeals--
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
--i
was
addressing
whether
the
exclusion
was
limited
to
commercial
paper.
i
was
addressing
arthur
young's
argument.
no...
two
courts
have
dealt
with
demand
notes,
two
courts
of
appeals.
both
have
concluded,
first,
that
it's
a
commercial
paper
exclusion.
and
the
most
recent
being
the
holloway
case,
which
was
just
decided
by
the
tenth
circuit
in
1989.
this
is
still
a
live
issue.
second,
in
the
zeller
case
by
judge
friendly,
he
specifically
said,
i'm
not
going
to
decide
whether
demand
notes
are
within
the
exclusion
or
not,
but
i'll
pretend
that
they
are.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
that
they
were
securities.
they
were
widely
offered
as
investments,
the
things
that
we
say
should
matter.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
r.
mccambridge
that
is
the
single
exclusion.
the
rest
of
it
is
identical.
there
is
no
legislative
history
as
to
the
reason
for
the
omission.
now,
there's
two
possibilities.
one,
congress
meant
to
exclude
only
short-term
commercial
paper
not
offered
to
the
public.
or,
what
arthur
young
says,
which
is
congress
also
meant
to
exclude
short-term
investment
notes
widely
offered
to
the
public.
we
suggest,
and
i
think
judge
friendly
has
indicated,
that
interpretation
is
inconceivable
because
the
senate
and
the
house
said
the
definitions
of
security
in
the
'33
and
'34
acts
are
substantially
the
same.
our
reading
of
it,
the
reading
that
every
court
of
appeals
has
given
it,
is
consistent
with
that.
those
two
definitions
of
securities
are
substantially
the
same.
the
only
thing
out
are
notes
not
offered
to
the
public
that
are
commercial
paper.
their
reading,
i
suggest,
would
create
two
definitions
that
would
be
widely
different
and
there's
no
basis
for
it,
no
history
to
it,
and
it
is
incomprehensible
that
that's
what
they
wanted
to
do.
arthur
young's
alternative
test...
the
number
one...
here's
where
they
say
context
does
matter.
they
admit
it.
and
what
is
the
most
important
factor,
the
one
that
is
brought
up
again
and
again?
where
did
you
buy
the
note?
did
you
buy
it
in
a
stationery
store
or
did
you
get
it
from
a
lawyer?
that
is...
what
possible
difference
could
that
make?
it
is
a
ridiculous
factor
that
was
pulled
out
solely
for
this
case.
