mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
should
be
little
doubt
from
a
common
sense
viewpoint,
and
also
from
a
legal
standpoint,
that
the
transactions
in
this
case
are
precisely
the
type
of
financial
activities
that
congress
sought
to
regulate
through
the
securities
laws.
the
farmer's
co-op
was
an
agricultural
cooperative
in
the
business
of
marketing
and
supplying
farm
products
for
its
members.
it
was
not
in
the
banking
or
financial
services
business.
in
order
to
raise
capital
and
also
to
cover
operating
expenses,
the
co-op
marketed
and
sold
demand
notes...
interest-bearing
demand
notes
to
the
public...
the
public
being
its
members
and
others
with
whom
it
did
business.
by
the
time
of
the
co-op's
demise,
some
1,600
individual
investors
hold
co-op
notes
having
a
total
face
value
of
some
$10
million--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--justice
white,
if
in
fact
the
case
were
as
you
posited
with
just
a
bank,
a
single
bank,
loaning
money
to
the
co-op
to
cover
operating
expenses,
in
our
view,
under
the
second
circuit's
family
resemblance
test,
which
we
urge
this
court
to
adopt,
those
notes
would
not
be
covered.
i
only
mentioned
the
comparison
to
a
bank
in
my
opening
remarks
because
there
is
a
hint,
in
the
respondent's
brief,
that
these
transactions
were
like
a
banking
transaction...
were
like
banking
transactions.
and
they
are
not.
the
co-op
was
not
governmentally
regulated
or
an
insured
financial
institution.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes.
that's
clear
from
the
record.
the
principal
question
presented
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
us,
is
whether
the
notes
qualify
as
securities
under
the
statutory
definition
of
note
or
whether
they
should
be
treated
under
the
residual
category
of
investment
contract.
in
our
view,
these
notes
do
qualify
under
the
statutory
definition
of
note
and
are
securities.
and
in
reaching
that
conclusion
we
urge
this
court
to
take
the
occasion
to
adopt
the
second
circuit's
family
resemblance
test
as
the
proper
approach
for
determining
whether
an
instrument
labeled
a
note
is
a
security.
all
agree
that
the
security--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--well,
first
of
all,
justice
o'connor,
what
is
on
the
list
today...
the
different
examples
that
the
second
circuit
has
previously
put
on
the
list
and
also,
as
judge
friendly
made
clear
in
the
chemical
bank
case...
the
examples
on
the
list,
in
his
words,
were
not
graven
in
stone.
the
point
was
that
it's
just
a
starting
point.
the
second
circuit
has
picked
out
from
the
case
law,
from
the
commentary,
and
from
experience,
those
types
of
notes
that
all
should
agree
are
not
covered
under
the
securities
laws.
and,
in
fact,
the
chemical
bank
case
took
the
next
step
and
added
what
might
be
considered
one
of
the
more
important
categories,
which
is
sort
of
what
justice
white
was
mentioning
before,
and
that
is
a
loan
transaction
between
a
bank
and
a
borrower.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
what
stands
behind
that
list
are,
first
of
all,
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
it's
important
for
us
to
start...
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
endorsed
the
family
resemblance
test
is
that
of
all
the
approaches
available
it
must
closely
conforms
to
the
statutory
language.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
the
maturity...
the
statutory
exclusion
in
the
'34
act,
in
our
view,
as
petitioners
mentioned
before
that
statutory
exclusion
is
limited
to
commercial
paper.
this
court
has
suggested
as
much
in
the
securities
industry
association
case,
and
we
would
agree
with
that
suggestion
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
exclusion
uses
the
phrase...
and
it's
a
four-term
phrase...
note,
draft,
bill
of
exchange
or
banker's
acceptance.
that
four-term
phrase
comes
from
something.
we
suggest
it
comes
from
section
13
of
the
federal
reserve
act
and
the
federal
reserve
board's
corresponding
regulation
a.
those
words
themselves
tell
you
that
congress
had
something
in
mind
other
than
any
note
with
a
maturity
of
less
of
nine
months.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
because
they
said
any
note,
draft,
bill
of
exchange
or
banker's
acceptance.
and
those
four
terms,
next
to
each
other,
mean
something.
they
mean...
those
are...
that's
congress'
way
of
describing
commercial
paper.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
well,
so
are...
and,
again,
so
are
bill
of
acceptance
or
banker's
draft,
but
all...
describing
the
types
of
instruments
that
in
the
early
1930s
congress
knew
covered
commercial
paper.
and
there's
more--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--yes.
a
note...
only
certain
types
of
notes
are
also
commercial
paper.
notice,
obviously,
the
broader
category.
but
there
is
something
other
than
the
language
and
the
structure
of
that
particular
exclusion.
the
legislative
history
shows
that
congress
put
the
exclusion
first
in
the
'33
act
in
response
to
a
commercial...
the
financial
community's
concern
of
regulating
commercial
paper.
and
commercial
paper,
as
it
was
then
and
as
it
is
today,
is
not
ordinarily
traded
and
sold
between
the
ordinary
investing
public.
apart
from
both
the
language...
we
urge
the
court
that
the
structure
of
that
exclusion
means
something.
apart
from
the
legislative
history,
the
purposes
of
the
securities
laws
call
for
that
exclusion
to
be
read
the
way
we
suggest,
because
it
would
make
no
sense.
this
court
has
held
since
the
joiner
case
45
years
ago,
going
up
through
landreth,
that
we
cannot
forget
the
purposes
of
the
securities
laws.
i
submit
it
would
make
no
sense
to
include
within
that
exclusion
the
public
offering
of
eight-month
notes
offered
to
the
general
public.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
no,
that's
not
true.
under
the--
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
--under
the
family
resemblance
test
with
cespe
a
short-term
notes,
the
test
would
proceed
as
follows.
the
test
first
starts
with
the
statutory
language
defining
a
security
as
including
any
note,
and
then
takes
account
of
the
exclusionary
language,
and
then
construes
those
provisions
in
light
of
the
preparatory
clause
unless
the
context
otherwise
requires.
for
example,
a
note
having
in
it
a
maturity
date
of
less
than
nine
months
is
initially
presumed
not
to
be
a
security,
following
the
statutory
language.
but
then
the
party
seeking
to
overcome
that
presumption,
for
example,
in
this
case,
would
have
to
show
that
the
context
otherwise
requires.
the
first
thing
that
party
would
show
is,
look,
this
isn't
commercial
paper,
so
i
can't
be
shut
out
under
the
securities
laws
for
that
reason.
the
second
step...
or,
actually,
the
way
the
test
works,
it
would
have
been
the
first...
my
note
doesn't
resemble
both
types
of
notes
that
all
would
agree
fall
outside
the
scope
of
the
securities
laws.
so,
we
think
the
exclusionary
language
does
have
a
place.
although
it
hasn't
come
up
yet,
under
the
second
circuit's
test,
the
second
circuit
used
the
phrase
"fits
the
general
description
of
commercial
paper.
"
so
there
could
be...
it
hasn't
happened
yet,
but
there
might
be
an
instrument
that
for
one
particular
reason
doesn't
qualify
as
commercial
paper
within
the
strictures
of
let's
say
the
sec's
61
release.
but
it
otherwise
might
be
so
close
that
perhaps
it
shouldn't
be
covered
by
the
securities
laws.
that
case
hasn't
come
up
yet.
but
we
do
think
that
the
language
does
have
meaning
and
we
disagree
with
any
suggestion
that
because
of
the
way
we
interpret
the
exclusionary
clause
that
it
writes
it
out
of
the
act.
it
doesn't,
and
in
fact
judge
friendly,
in
the
exchange
national
bank
case
and
chemical
bank,
made
clear
that
that
was
his
disagreement
with
some
other
courts,
that
threw
up
their
hands
and
said,
well,
i
guess
we're
just
writing
this
out
of
the
act.
the
second
circuit's
test
does
not,
and
it
still
plays
a
part,
as
it
must,
because
it
is
written
into
the
law
and
we
can't
disregard
the
law.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
it
changes
the
presumption
that
flips
the
burden
back
to
the
party
seeking
coverage.
in
this
case
it
would
be
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
right.
the
first
thing
would
be...
just
to
answer
that
question...
that
it's
not
commercial
paper.
mr.
michael
r.
lazerwitz
thank
you.
