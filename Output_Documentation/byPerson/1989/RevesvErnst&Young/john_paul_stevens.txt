mr.
mccambridge,
can
i
ask
you
a
factual
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
i
was
a
little
unclear
on?
the
note,
the
actual
form
of
note
they
have
has
a
place
to
insert
the
interest
amount
in
it.
and
i
guess
your
advertisement...
the
advertisement
you
referred
to,
referred
to
a
14
percent
interest
rate.
does
that
mean
that
the
14
percent...
say
such
a
note
was
given
to
a
depositor
or
lender...
does
that
mean
the
14
percent
would
just
stay
there
until
the
money
was
withdrawn
and
a
different
deposit
made?
or,
would...
as
i
understood
it,
also,
they
adjusted
the
interest
rate
periodically.
would
the
interest
fluctuate
for
a
particular
depositor
without
the
necessity
of
another
note
being
executed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
be
either
up
or
down?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
was...
that
was...
because
it
doesn't
really
fit
the
language
of
the
note
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
and
the
note
does
use
the
word
"maturity"
i
notice
also,
which
i
guess
would
be
the
time
of
demand
is
what
they're
referring
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
but
you
could
argue,
i
suppose
that
if
the
demand
isn't
made
within
the
nine
months,
the
maturity
date
was
more
than
nine
months
after
issuance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
what
is
the
statute
of
limitations
in
arkansas
on...
on
a
demand
note?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
means
the
same--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--say,
if
it
was
five
years,
if
they
left
the
money
in
the
bank
for
five
years,
they
could
never
get
it
back?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
rather
strange.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
they
leave
the
money
on
deposit
for
longer
than
the
statutory
limitations
period,
they
forfeit
the
money
under
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
that's
the...
that's
the
net
effect
of
the
rule
that
you're
telling
us
they
adopt
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you...
may
i
ask
you
just
two
quick
questions?
do
you
cite
the
arkansas
cases
that
give
this
holding
on--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--thank
you.
secondly,
just
out
of
curiosity
because
you're
certainly
free
to
make
the
point,
but
did
you
argue
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
you
came
within
the
exclusion
for
paper
that
was
less
than
nine
months
maturity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
on
the
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
on
the
question
of
whether
you
just
use
plain
language
on
the
exclusion.
they've
been
just
as
practical
about
the
exclusion
as
you
suggest
is
proper
under
the
general
language
of
the
statute,
haven't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
in
1972.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
judge
friendly's
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--certainly
was
not
insignificant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
judge
friendly's
case
looked
at
the
history
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
an--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
don't
see
how
you
break
it
if
you
say
the
words
in
the
context...
unless
the
context
otherwise
requires
reference
to
statutory
context
rather
than
transactional
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
in
the
general
part?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
in
the
home
mortgage
note
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
do
you
get...
i
don't
understand
how
you
handle
the
home
mortgage
note?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
