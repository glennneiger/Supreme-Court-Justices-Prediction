justice
scalia
ms.
steller,
if...
if
i
may
put
in
my
candidate
for
things
that
aren't
mentioned
in
the
brief
that
maybe
should
have
been,
the
earliest
case
i
see
cited
by
any
side
is,
i
think,
1871.
these
words
were
written
about
a
hundred
years
before
that.
is...
is
nobody
have
any
interest
at
all
at...
at
what...
at
the
time
the
constitution
was
adopted...
being
tried
twice
for
the
same
offense
was
thought
to
apply
to?
justice
scalia
have
you
done
any
historical
research
in
it
at
all...
what...
what...
you
know
what--
justice
scalia
uh-huh.
justice
scalia
and
what
does
that
prove?
justice
scalia
right,
right.
justice
scalia
--well,
now
how
does--
justice
scalia
--uh-huh.
justice
scalia
but
how
does...
how
does
that
establish
that
the
only
application
of
this
provision
of
the
constitution
is
to
offenses
that
have
different
elements
as
opposed
to
later
prosecution
on
the
basis
of
the
same
facts?
i
mean,
i
have
no
doubt
that
there
is...
is
substantial
historical
support
for
the
position
that
you
take
that
you
can't
try
a
person
for
an
offense
that
includes
the
same
element
of
an
offense
already
committed
and
nothing
additional.
but
the
issue
before
us
is
whether
it
includes
something
beyond
that,
whether
it
includes
using
the
same
evidence
as
a
necessary
part
of
the
later
prosecution.
justice
scalia
--but
we
said
in
vitale,
although
the
mere
possibility
that
the
state
will
seek
to
rely
on
all
of
the
ingredients
necessarily
included
blah,
blah,
blah,
would
not
be
sufficient
to
bar.
it...
it
did
suggest
that
if
in
fact
it
turned
out
that
the
evidence
was
the
same,
there
might
have
been
a
problem.
justice
scalia
even
though
the
same
evidence
is
introduced
and...
and
the
core
of
all
of
them
is
whether...
really,
whether,
he
was
driving
under
intoxication.
and
he's
acquitted
in
the
first
three...
the
first
three
juries
find
that
there's...
they
just
can't
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he
was,
but
you
finally
get
a
fourth
jury
who
finds
otherwise.
that
doesn't
trouble
you
at
all?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
well,
what...
what
you
are
now
saying
gives
me
cause
to
wonder
whether
your
response
to
justice
kennedy
was
correct
earlier.
i
thought
we
had
established
that
it...
under
the...
under
the
indictment
here
it
was
clear
that
the
state
was
going
to
use
as
a
principal
part
of
its
case
the...
the
intoxication.
justice
scalia
you're
saying
it's
not
an
essential
part
of
its
case?
justice
scalia
that
it
can
win
its
case
even...
even
if
he's...
even
if
the
jury
doesn't
believe
he
was
intoxicated?
justice
scalia
but...
but
we
have
to
evaluate
your
legal
theory
on
the
basis
of
what
results
it
could
produce,
not
just
the
results
it
might
happen
to
produce
in
this
case.
and
you
acknowledge
that...
that
your
legal
theory
can
produce
the
result
that
justice
stevens
described.
justice
scalia
mr.
corbin
had
killed
somebody,
hadn't
he?
justice
scalia
of
course,
to
agree
with
frankfurter
and
brock
we
don't
have
to
adopt
the
rule
that
you're
proposing.
it's
enough
to...
to
support
that,
that
you...
if...
if
you're
acquitted
the
first
time,
you
can't
then
bring
the
same
evidence
that
the
jury
has
rejected
the
first
time
around
back.
frankfurther
says
to
see
if
the
prosecutor
cannot
do
better
a
second
time.
justice
scalia
the
prosecutor
is
not
trying
to
do
better
here.
he
won
the
first
time;
he's
trying
to
win
again
the
second
time.
justice
scalia
they
lost
the
blood
sample
and
they
find
it.
