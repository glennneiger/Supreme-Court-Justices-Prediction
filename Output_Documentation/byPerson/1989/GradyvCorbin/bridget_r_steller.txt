ms.
bridget
r.
steller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
matter
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
issued
to
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals.
and
the
issue
raised
is
whether,
within
the
constraints
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment,
a
motorist,
who
causes
the
death
of
another
person
as
a
result
of
an
automobile
collision,
may
be
subject
to
a
prosecution
for
homicide
and/or
assault,
even
though,
at
the
scene
of
the
collision
and
prior
to
the
death
of
the
motorist
he
or
she...
prior
to
the
death
of
the
other
person
that
motorist
is
charged
with
driving
while
intoxicated
and
failure
to
keep
right,
and
then
subsequent
to
the
death,
enters
pleas
of
guilty
to
those
vehicle
and
traffic
violations,
and
is
sentenced.
in
this
case,
on
october
3rd,
1987
there
was
an
automobile...
there
were...
collision...
an
automobile
driven
by
the
respondent,
thomas
corbin,
was
being
operated
in
a
westbound
direction
on
route
55
in
the
town
of
lagrange.
it
first
collided
with
an
eastbound
vehicle
and
struck
the
rearview
mirror...
or
struck
the
sideview
mirror
of
that
car.
it
proceeded
into
the
eastbound
lane
and
struck
a
second
vehicle
in
which
brenda
dirago
was
the
operator
and
her
husband,
daniel
dirago,
was
the
passenger.
respondent
corbin
and
both
mr.
and
mrs.
dirago
were
taken
to
the
hospital,
where
at
approximately
8:00,
respondent
corbin
was
arrested
for
driving
while
intoxicated
and
failure
to
keep
right.
he
was
issued
traffic
tickets
for
those
offenses.
he
then
consented
to
having
blood
withdrawn,
and
blood
was
withdrawn
for
the
purpose
of
chemical
analysis
at
approximately
8:25
p.m.--
the
defendant
was
not
arraigned
that
night.
he
was
hospitalized.
the
tickets
which
were
issued
to
him,
directed
to...
him
to
appear
in
the
town
of
lagrange
court,
a
justice
court,
on
october
29th,
a
thursday
night.
however,
the
court
did
not
sit
on
thursday
nights,
it
sits
on
tuesday
night.
so
the
court
sent
a
letter
to
the
respondent
corbin
directing
him
to
appear
on
an
advanced
return
date,
that
date
being
october
27th.
no
notice
was
given
to
the
district
attorney
of
the
advanced
return
date.
on
the
night
that
the
defendant
appeared,
it
was
not
a
night
scheduled
for
the
district
attorney
to
be
in
that
courtroom.
the
defendant
appeared
with
counsel,
and
entered
pleas
of
guilty
to
both...
both
the
misdemeanor
of
driving
while
intoxicated
and
the
violation
of
failure
to
keep
right.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
chief
justice
rehnquist,
it
would
generally
hear
misdemeanors
and
violations.
it
would
have
preliminary
jurisdiction
over
felonies,
but
its
jurisdiction
would
be
limited
to
holding
a
preliminary
hearing,
and
setting
bail
on
a
non-class
a
case,
which
would
be
a--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--yes,
your
honor.
i
might
also
add
that
an
assistant
district
attorney
was
called
to
the
scene
of
the
accident
on
the
night
of
october
3rd.
he
was
not
there
to
assess
what
charges
should
be
brought.
there
was
one
purpose
for
him
being
called,
and
that
was
to
prepare
a
search
warrant
if
one
was
necessary
to
obtain
blood.
when
he
arrived
at
the
scene,
the
defendant
had
already
been
arrested
and
charged.
he
learned
that
the
defendant
had
consented
to
having
blood
withdrawn,
and
he
left.
he
had
no
further
participation
in
the
investigation
that
evening.
and
he
did
not
help
draw
any
charges.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
yes,
your
honor,
because
we
rely
on
new
york
state
vehicle
and
traffic
law
section
1800(d),
and
we
have
relied
on
it
in
the
state
courts.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
okay.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i'll--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--it
seems
to
me
in
this
court
in
blockburger
and
in
vitale
has
set
forth
certain
rules
to
be
followed,
that
being
that--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--thank
you,
your
honor.
that
being
that
a
defendant
may
be
charged
with
the
greater...
with
a
greater
offense,
or
maybe
charged
with
two
offenses...
where...
and
there
can
be
subsequent
prosecutions...
where
there
are
different
elements
involved
in
each.
and
in
this
case,
we're
here
on
an
indictment
which
charged
the
defendant
with
manslaughter...
or
counts
of
the
indictment
pertaining
to
manslaughter,
criminally
negligent
homicide
and
assault.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
well,
your
honor--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--that,
plus
additional
factors
are
listed
in
the
bill
of
particulars,
your
honor.
he
was
charged
with
driving
while
intoxicated
and
failure
to
keep
right.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
in
large
part.
however,
the
accident
reconstructionist's
report...
which
was
not
available
until
january
of
1988...
also
indicated
the
speeds...
the
respective
speeds
of
the
vehicles
and
the
positions
of
the
vehicles
at
the
time
of
impact.
this
was
not--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--known
on
the
night
of
the
23rd.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
a
large
part--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--yes.
a
large
part.
the
court
of
appeals'
majority
opinion
indicates
that
we
are
bound
by
the
bill
of
particulars
until
amended,
and
it
has
not
been
amended,
your
honor.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
yes,
your
honor.
plus
additional
facts.
but
you
must
remember,
there
was
no
first
trial
here.
the
was
a
plea
of
guilty
at
arraignment.
and
the
defendant
pled
guilty
to
common
law
driving
while
intoxicated.
the
blood
test
results
weren't
even
back
at
the
time.
the
blood
test
results
were
not
received
by
the
district
attorney
until
october
30th.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
it
might
present
it
in
a
different
light,
your
honor.
i
recognize
that--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--in
the
sense
that
you
would
know
exactly
what
evidence
was...
had
been
presented--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--the
state
court
has
told
us
that
we
are
bound
by
our
bill
of
particulars,
which
does
include
elements
which
were
involved
in
the
crimes
to
which
the
defendant
pled
guilty.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
because,
your
honor,
this
court
has
never
held
that
we
must
try
all
offenses
that
arise
from
one
series
of
acts
or
one
acts
in
one
trial.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
i
don't
think
so,
justice
o'connor,
because
in
harris
there
is
a
footnote
that
in
the
state's
brief,
the
state
conceded
that
both
felony
murder
and
the
underlying
robbery
were
the
same.
and
also,
in
this
court's
opinion
in
vitale,
this
court
recognized...
or
this
court
commented
about
the...
it's
cited
or
it's
quoted
at
page
18
of
the
petitioner's
main
brief,
"for
the
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
we
do
not
consider
the
crime
generally
described
as
felony
murder
as
a
separate
offense
distinct
from
its
various
elements.
"
"rather,
we
treat
a
killing
in
the
course
of
a
robbery
as
itself
a
separate
statutory
offense
and
the
robbery
as
a
species
of
lesser
included
offense.
"
here,
i
don't
think
you
can
ever
say
that
driving
while
intoxicated
is
a
lesser
included
offense
of
manslaughter,
criminally
negligent
homicide
or
assault
because
the
homicide
charges
involve
a
death,
the
assault
charge
involves
physical
injury.
driving
while
intoxicated
involves
operation
of
a
motor
vehicle
that
is
not
is
not
necessarily
involved
in
a
manslaughter
or
an
assault
prosecution.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
not
in
every
manslaughter
case,
your
honor.
and
this
is
not
a
vehicular
manslaughter
charge.
this
is
a
more
traditional
manslaughter
charge.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
no,
your
honor,
i
didn't.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
certainly,
your
honor.
i
think
that
in...
in
the
reply
brief
i
did
mention
it,
your
honor.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
yes,
your
honor,
i
did.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
but
i
don't...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
no,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
believe
that
we
are...
this
court
has
held
that
we
would
be
collaterally
estopped,
or
that
res
judicata
would
apply
in
this
particular
case.
and
i
think
that
in
this
type
of
case
we
are
governed
by
this
court's
rulings
in
blockburger
and
vitale.
also,
i
think
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
is
a
strong
public
interest
in
law
enforcement
and
that
the
people
should
be
given
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
present
their
case.
and
i
think
that's
something
that
arises
with
collateral
estoppel
and
res
judicata.
that
doesn't
happen
here.
and
i
think
the
legislature
of
the
state
of
new
york
has
a
right
when
they
are
enacting
a
statutory
scheme
to
consider
this
court's
rulings,
such
as
blockburger,
such
as
gavieres,
and
decide
that
it
is
permissible
to
have
vehicle
and
traffic
offenses
prosecuted
separately
because
they
are
not
generally
lesser
included
offenses
of
assault
and
homicide.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
on
the
traditional
homicide
and
assault
charges,
yes,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
and--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--i
think--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--i
think,
your
honor,
this
court's
decisions
which
are
cited
in
our
briefs,
refer
to
blackstone's
commentaries.
and
i
think
that
traditionally
in
england
you
would
not
be
prosecuted
for
two
offenses
in
the
same
indictment.
and
i
think
you'd
seen
that
in
this
court
in
thigpen
v.
roberts
because
in
mississippi
there
was
a
dwi
prosecution
and
a
homicide
prosecution.
and
i
believe,
during
the
argument...
oral
argument
it
was
discussed
that
traditionally
in
mississippi
you
were
not
allowed
to
join
offenses.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--and
that
results
from
the
common
law
traditions.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
well,
your
honor,
you
asked
me
about
a
historical
analysis--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--and
i
believe--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--that
historically
you
would
not
have
joined
a
minor
offense
with
a
more
serious
offense.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
obviously
at
common
law
we
wouldn't
have
vehicle
and
traffic
violations,
but
i
think
that
anything
of
that
nature
would
not
have
been
joined.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
i
think
that
this
court
has
held
previously
that
it
is
not...
that
it
is
perfectly
permissible
to
use
some
of
the
same
evidence.
i
think
that
that
issue
was
addressed
by
the
court
in
vitale,
where
the
court
indicated
that
it
was
permissible.
in
fact,
part
of
vitale's
problem
may
have
been
the
way
it
arose
in
this
court.
vitale
came
before
the
court
on
a
petition
for
certiorari.
this
court
granted
the
writ
and
remanded
to
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
for
further
proceedings
to
determine
whether
it
was
based
on
a
federal
question...
whether
their
decision
was
based
on
a
federal
question.
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
then
indicated
that
it
was...
their
decision
was
based
on
a
federal
issue.
however--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
your
honor,
i
believe
the
majority
opinion
in
dicta
says
a
substantial
double
jeopardy
claim.
but
substantial
should
not
be
equated
with
dispositive.
because
if
it
was
dispositive,
then
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
a
majority
opinion.
and
in
the
briefs
in
vitale
which
were
filed
with
this
court,
the
state
indicated
what
its
evidence
was
going
to
be.
also,
although
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
had
indicated
in
its
opinion
that
the
failing
to
slow...
which
was
the
motor
vehicle
violation...
was
a
lesser
included
offense
of
manslaughter...
which
is
the
charge
that
respondent
vitale
was
charged
with
following
his
vehicle
and
traffic
trial,
during
oral
argument,
respondent...
in
this
court...
respondent
vitale's
counsel
conceded
that
it
was
not
the
lesser
included
offense.
but
i
think
the
issue
there...
and
i
think
we
addressed
it
in
our...
our
brief,
if
i
may
refer
to
it...
at
page
17,
the
term
"the"
in
your
opinion,
immediately
preceding
the
reckless
act,
implies
that
you
might
have
been
concerned
based
on
the
supreme
court
of
illinois's
opinion
that
the
prior
conviction
for
failing
to
slow
would
always
be
an
element
of
involuntary
manslaughter.
here
that's
not
the
case.
we
are...
we
clearly
have
separate
offenses
with
separate
elements.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
it
was
my
understanding,
your
honor,
that
the
court's...
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
did
not
permit
the
prosecution.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
i
think
that
was
the
decision,
but
their
decision
also
was...
in
the
case
that
was
before
you,
the
supreme
court's
decision
was
that
the
failure
to
slow
was
a
lesser
included
offense
of
the
homicide.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
that
is
not
the
way
this
case
reaches
this
court.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
no,
your
honor,
that's
not
quite
my
position.
because
under
state
law
i
recognize
that
there
is
a
joinder
provision.
i
would
concede
that
all
of
the
homicide
counts
would
have
to
be
tried
together.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
we
would
have
to
have...
if
i
understand
your
question...
there
would
be
a
potential
for
a
failure
to
keep
right
trial,
a
driving
while
intoxicated
trial,
an
assault
trial
and
a
homicide
trial.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
however,
i
realize
that
new
york
has
a
compulsory
joinder
section
which
would
have--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--yes,
your
honor,
the
driving
while
intoxicated
counts
which
were
included,
and
i
believe
either
one
or
two
of
the
vehicular
manslaughter
counts.
we're
not
arguing
about
the
vehicular
manslaughter
counts
here.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
no,
your
honor.
under
blockburger
and
under
vitale
i
do
not
think
there
would
be
a
federal
constitutional
bar.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
there
is
an
issue
here,
and
that
is
what
was
the
issue
before
the
jury.
and
i
think
you've
already
decided
that.
in
a
case
where
a
person
was
charged
with
committing
six
robberies
and
there
was
trial
on
four
of
them,
and
the
defense
being
that
only...
that
the
defendant
had
not
participated.
i
think
this
court
said
that
the
people
could
not
proceed
with
that...
with
that
additional
robbery
prosecution
because
the
jury
had
necessarily
found
that
the
defendant
was
not
the
robber.
however,
that's
not
the
issue
here.
the
issue
here,
in
a...
in
a
potential
for
four
trials,
would
be,
did
the
defendant...
number
one,
was
he
intoxicated,
number
two,
did
he
fail
to
keep
right.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
but
assuming...
even
if
you
assume
that
he
was
not
intoxicated,
i
think
that
the
prosecution
could
still
go
forward
on
the
homicide
theories
because
there
are
other
elements
here.
there
is
an
element
of
driving
his
vehicle
into
the
opposite
lane
of
traffic,
and
there's
a
substantial
overlap
of
vehicles.
and
i
think
it
would
be
up
to
the
jury
to
consider
the
other
elements
of
whether
the
defendant
acted
recklessly
or
did
he
act
with
criminal
negligence,
and
then,
was
the
death
the
result
of
his
reckless
conduct
or
his
criminal
negligence.
similarly
with
the
assault
count.
it
would
be
did
he
cause
physical
injury
and
was
his
conduct
reckless?
this
is
not
a
case
where--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--your
honor,
that
would
be
some
of
the
evidence
introduced
at
this
trial.
however,
the
jury
would
be
free
to
accept
or
reject
it.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
no,
i
don't
believe
that
it
is.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
the
jury--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--your
honor,
the
evidence--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--that
goes
to
the--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--evidence
which
would
we...
which
the
prosecution
would
intend
to
adduce
at
the
trial.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
however--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--we
would
have
to
introduce
evidence.
the
jury...
it
would
be
up
to
jury
to
credit
the
evidence.
and
that's
part
of
the
problem
with
analyzing
double
jeopardy
after
a
second
trial.
because
you
don't
know
what
evidence
the
jury
credited
at
the
first
trial
in
many
cases,
and
you
don't
know
what
evidence
they
credited
at
the
second
trial.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
well,
that's
just
another--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--well,
it's
not
just
another
element,
justice
stevens,
because
we
would
be
deleting
other
elements.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
counts
of
this
indictment,
if
you
read
the
statutory
language,
as
this
court
has
indicated
should
be
done
in
its
opinions
in
blockburger--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--then
you're--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--then
you
are
looking
at
the
evidence
adduced,
and
that's
the
problem,
we
believe,
with
the
state
court's
opinion.
we
are
asking
you
to
reverse
that
opinion
because
we
believe
they
have
misconstrued
your
opinions
concerning
double
jeopardy,
that
being
that
you
do
not
look
at
the
evidence
which
will
be
adduced,
you
look
at
the
statutory
elements
and
conduct
a
statutory
analysis.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
that's
true.
and
this
court
has
said,
even
if
there
is
a
substantial
overlap
in
proof
it
doesn't--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--as
a
general
rule,
yes,
judge.
but
here,
this
case
that
comes
before
you
is
not
limited
to
the
identical
evidence.
there
are
other
elements
here.
obviously,
the
speed
at
which
the
defendant
was
traveling
would
not
be
relevant
on
his
failure
to
keep
right
charge.
so
there
are
different
elements
as
you
analyze
the
statutory
elements,
and
some
evidence,
which
is
indicated
in
the
bill
of
particulars,
would
not
be
included,
just
as
the
defendant's
blood
alcohol
level
would
not
be
relevant
at
a
failure
to
keep
right
trial.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
in
the...
you
have
indicated
that
society
has
an
interest
in
law
enforcement,
and
in
enacting
1800(d)
of
the
vehicle
and
traffic
law,
the
new
york
state
legislature
had
a
right
to
consider
how
the
vehicle
and
traffic
laws
were
to
be
enforced
and
how
they
would
affect
society.
now,
vehicle
and
traffic
laws
can
give
rise
to
a
variety
of
minor
offenses.
not
all
of
them
require
intervention
of
a
prosecutor.
in
fact,
the
vast
majority
of
new
york
cases
would
not
require
the
intervention
of
a
prosecutor.
in
most
cases,
the
district
attorney
would
not
even
receive
notice
of
a
vehicle
and
traffic
offense.
but
if
the
prosecution
for
a
homicide
was
barred
by
a
prosecution
for
a
vehicle
and
traffic
offense,
society
would
be
at
a
loss
because
of
that,
and
the
defendant
would
basically
be
getting
a
windfall.
and
i
don't
believe
that
that
was
ever
the
intention
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
thank
you.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
farrell
has
discussed
the
issue
with
fairness
to
the
defendant.
in
this
case
the
defendant
was
on
noticed
by
virtue
of
section
1800(d)
that
he
could
be
prosecuted
for
the
assault
and
homicide
in
spite
of
his
guilty
pleas
to
the
vehicle
and
traffic
offenses.
and
this
is
a
scheme
which
must
be
viewed
as
also
fair
to
society.
in
fact,
here,
prior
to
sentencing,
the
defendant
knew
that
the
prosecution
intended
to
present
this
case
to
a
grand
jury.
this
is
the
defense
counsel,
who
may
well
have
been
the
only
person
in
the
room
who
knew
about
it,
but
he
knew
about
it.
the
judge
and
the
prosecutor
who
was
present
did
not.
mr.
farrell
has
also
indicated
that
this
case
should
be
governed
by
new
york
state
criminal
procedure
law
section
170.20
which
provides
that
the
district
attorney
may
stop
any
justice
court
proceeding.
that
is
a
general
provision
of
the
criminal
procedure
law
of
new
york.
the
vehicle
and
traffic
provision
is
a
much
more
specific
one.
the
criminal
procedure
law
presumes
that
the
district
attorney
will
know
about
a
case.
the
vehicle
law
recognizes
that
vehicle
and
traffic
is
slightly
differently,
and
that
because--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
i
think
that
this
court
in
deciding
this
case
has
to
craft
a
rule
which
will
be
fairly
simple
and
can
be
applied
in
all
50
states.
and
i
think
that
there
are
many
cases,
not
just
in
new
york,
but
also
in...
i...
i
think
connecticut
is
specific
to
this...
that
it's
possible
in
a
vehicle
and
traffic
charge
for
the
district
attorney
to
have
no
notice
and
to
have
somebody
plead
guilty
by
mail.
similarly,
i
believe,
new
jersey
can
do
this.
but
here,
if
you
look
at
it,
the
district
attorney
had
no
notice
that
this
case
was
on
the
calendar
in
lagrange
on
october
27th.
that
is
the
day
the
plea
was
entered.
and
without
notice
of
the
date
of
the
appearance
that
the
defendant
was
supposed
to
be
in
court,
there
would
have
been
no
requirement
that
the
district
attorney
present--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--if
you
are
to
presume--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
the
district
attorney
is
charged
with--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--that's
right,
your
honor,
and
the
district
attorney--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--it's
not
just
a
mistake,
your
honor.
even
in
the
absence
of
a
mistake--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--even
in
the
absence
of
a
mistake,
your
honor--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
but
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
district
attorney
is
entitled
to
a
fair
opportunity.
and
if
he
has
no
notice
of
the
date
on
which
the
appearance
is
scheduled,
or
on
the
date
that
the
plea
is
entered,
he
can't
stop
it.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
no,
your
honor,
he
didn't.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
your
honor,
he
had
no
notice
on
the
night
the
plea
was
entered
that
the
case
was
even
on
the
calendar.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
judge,
i
don't
think
you
can
presume--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--yes,
your
honor,
but
as
a
practical--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--i
don't
think
that
this
court...
i
don't
believe
that
this
court
can
presume
on
this
record
that
anyone
in
dutchess
county
read
the
newspaper
on
the
morning
of
october
4th.
and
i
believe,
specifically--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--there
is
a--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--we
do,
your
honor,
but
i--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--your
honor,
on
the
morning
of
october
4th...
this
is
referred
to
in
the
district
attorney's
answer
in
the
county
court
to
the
defendant's
motion
to
dismiss
the
indictment.
there
was
a
blizzard.
there's
a
state
of
emergency
here.
and
i
don't
think
you
can
presume
that
anybody
in
dutchess
county
read
the
newspaper,
just
as
i
don't
think
that
anyone
on
this
court
can
presume
that
somebody
in
charleston
read
the
newspaper
the
morning
after
hugo
struck.
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
your
honor,
i
don't...
this
is
october
4th
in
the
mid-hudson
valley.
the
leaves
are
on
the
trees.
it's
not
just
a
snow
storm.
it
was
a
blizzard.
and
if
you
think
about
the
effect
of
a
blizzard
when
you
have
leaves
on
the
trees--
ms.
bridget
r.
steller
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
on
the
other
hand,
there's
no
constitutional
law
that
you
can
presume
that
somebody
read
the
newspaper.
