justice
stevens
does
all...
do
these
facts
make
any
difference
to
your
legal
argument?
i
mean,
supposing
the
state's
attorney
had
been
fully
advised
all
the
way
along
the
line,
you'd
still
have
the
same
legal
argument,
wouldn't
you?
justice
stevens
your
position
is,
even
if
he
pleaded
guilty
or
was
convicted
of
this
offense,
you
could
go
ahead
and
prosecute
him
for
the
greater
offense.
justice
stevens
so
i
don't
know,
why...
what
relevance,
all
these
facts
have.
justice
stevens
i'm
just
suggesting
that
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
justice
stevens
this
court.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
ms.
steller,
may
i
ask
you
two
questions?
one,
do
you
know
what
happened
in
vitale
after
we
sent
it
back
for
the
last
time?
justice
stevens
i...
i
just
didn't
know--
justice
stevens
--right.
justice
stevens
no,
i
understand.
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
we
have
four
different
offenses.
dwi...
i
can't
remember
them...
reckless
manslaughter,
criminally
negligent
homicide,
and
third-degree
reckless
assault...
each
of
which
has
an
element
that
none
of
the
others
do.
so
under
blockburger...
if
i
understand...
let
me
be
sure
i
have
your
position.
if
the
state
elected
to,
it
could
take
them
one
at
a
time,
prove
him
guilty
of
dwi,
then
try
the
second
case
for
reckless
assault,
prove
him
guilty
of
that,
and
prove
him
guilty
of
the
third
one
for
reckless
manslaughter
and
then
go
ahead
with
the
fourth
trial.
so,
under
your
position,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
you're
entitled
to
four
separate
trials.
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
state
law.
i
mean
as
a...
there
would
be
no
federal
constitutional
objection
as
long
as
you
get
four
separate
offenses
each
of
which
has
an
element
different
from
the
others,
even
though
they
have
certain
common
elements.
under
your
view
of
blockburger,
i
think,
just
as
you
could
try
one
or
two,
you
could
also
try
all
four.
you
could
have
four
trials
here.
justice
stevens
correct.
because
each
has
an
element
that...
a
statutory
element
that
the
other...
that
none
of
the
others
has.
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
oh,
i
understand,
and
they've
thrown
out
two
of
your
seven
counts
for
that
reason...
or
three...
or
two
or
three,
i
can't
remember.
justice
stevens
but
that's
not
what
the
court
of
appeals
said.
"thus,
unlike
illinois
vitale,
there's
no
need
in
this
case
to
await
the
trial
to
ascertain
whether
the
prosecution
will
rely
on
the
prior
traffic
offenses
as
the
acts
necessary
to
prove
the
homicide
and
assault
charges.
"
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that's--
justice
stevens
--somewhat
inconsistent.
justice
stevens
well,
they
said
as
the--
justice
stevens
--acts
necessary
to
prove
these
charges.
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
construed
it.
justice
stevens
well,
i
think
you
may
well
be
right
that
if
there
was
an
acquittal
that
would
bar
farther...
future
prosecutions.
but
my
hypothetical
was
four
successive
victories
by
the
state.
they
take
the
easiest...
lowest
one
first,
get
a...
a
victory,
and
then
i
think
under
your
theory
there
would
be
no
bar
of
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel.
you'd
just...
you'd
just
add
another
element
and
get
another...
another
conviction.
justice
stevens
so
i
think
you
could
get
four
separate
convictions
under
your
theory.
justice
stevens
well,
not
as
i
read
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion.
i
mean,
maybe
i
misread
it,
but
i--
justice
stevens
--yes,
but
you
have
to
read
the
bill
of
particulars
too
and
the--
justice
stevens
--construction
that
your
state
court
puts
on
the
bill
of
particulars.
that's
all
part
of
the
case.
justice
stevens
but...
but
you're
saying
that
when
you
do
that,
you
can
do
it
even
if
it's
precisely
the
same
evidence
in
each
case.
that's
your
legal
position.
i...
i
mean,
it
certainly...
it's...
it's
a
permissible
argument.
justice
stevens
even
if
it's
an
entire
overlap.
that's
the
point.
you
can
be
completely
overlapped,
and
you
still...
you
still
win
under
your
legal
theory.
