mr.
richard
t.
farrell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
of
bad
draftsmanship.
the
fifth
amendment
was
poorly
drafted.
it
doesn't
tell
us
what
the
term
offense
means.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
even
spells
it
differently
than
the
modern
spelling.
we
find
ourselves
in
this
case,
once
again,
after
lessons
of
blockburger
and
vitale;
the
nonlesson,
if
you
will,
of
thigpen
v.
roberts;
the
recessed
lesson
of
fugate
v.
new
mexico,
addressing
before
this
court,
the
question
of
what
the
term
"same
offense"
means.
if
blockburger
is
the
sole
test,
i'll
sit
down.
because
i'm
through.
i
lose.
corbin
goes
to
trial.
because
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
new
york
acknowledged
that
if
the
blockburger
test,
analytical
approach...
call
it
what
you
will...
is
the
way
that
one
determines
what
the
fifth
amendment
proscribes,
then
as
to
the...
i
keep
on
losing
track
of
the
numbers
of
these
things...
three
of
the
counts
of
the
indictment
survive
a
blockburger-based
analysis.
in
this
case
if
blockburger
is
the
law,
if
blockburger
is
all
that
the
fifth
amendment
requires,
then
this
case
goes
back
to
new
york
state
court
of
appeals
on
remand
and
the
court
of
appeals
will
do
that
voodoo
that
they
do
so
well
on
remand
from
this
court
and
decide
the
question
on
state
constitutional
law
grounds,
and
they
may
come
to
the
same
result,
they
may
not.
the
good
lord
only
knows.
i
sure
don't.
but
insofar
as
the
historical
exegesis
that
one
of
your
honors
asked
for,
there
are
two
things.
deeply
rooted
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
the
ancient...
it
must
be
an
ancient
maxim
because
it's
in
latin
"nemo
debet
bis
vexari
pro
eadem
causa.
"
and
if
it's
in
latin,
then
it's
got
to
be
old.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
well,
your
honor,
i'm
going
to
have
to
take
the
word
of
the
historical
exegesis
done
on
several
occasions
by
this
court
and
by
some
of
the
law
review
writers
that
track
the
idea
of
a
proscription
against
double
jeopardy,
as
we
call
it
now,
back
to
at
least
demosthenes'
times,
about
the
three
centuries
before
the
common
era.
and
flowing
from
that
and
taking
the
well-known
classical
rootings
of
many
of
our
founding
fathers
that
they...
we
can
assume
that
they
were
familiar
with
these
deep
historic
roots,
one
could
probably,
even
if
you
wanted
to
push
it
further,
run
the
whole
idea
back
into
scripture.

of

sent
off

the

"
the
above-captioned
case,
on

was
the

against

corbin
for
driving
while
intoxicated

your
honor,
the
district
attorney's
office
was
aware,
through
the
agent
that
was
on
the
scene
of
the
accident,
that
this
accident
had
caused
a
death.
it
knew
through
its
agent
on
the
scene
at
the
time...
at
the
time...
that
there
had
been
a
fatality.
their
office
proceeded
in
one
direction,
and
that
was
to
prepare
the
case
for
presentation
to
a
grand
jury.
but
incident
to
that...
incident
to
that...
they
indicated
quite
early
on,
within
two
weeks
after
the
fatality,
that
they
were
prepared
to
prosecute
on
the
tickets.
defense
counsel
appeared
before
the
lagrange
town
court
on
a
date
set
by
the
court,
set
by
the
court,
and
entered
a
plea
of
guilty
to

the
town
justice,
not
wanting
to
enter
or
make
any
sentence
on

adjourned
the

to
a
night
when

with

about

except
what
she
could
find
in

file,
and
in
the
court
file
all
that
was
there
were
these
two
tickets.
justice
caplicki
imposed
sentence,
a
$350
fine,
suspension
of
license,
driving
school.
and
six
weeks
later...
six
weeks
later...
the
district
attorney's
office,
or
more
precisely,
the
grand
jury
in
dutchess
county,
returned
the
indictment
that
gave
rise
to
the
initiation
of
the
proceedings
in
this
case,
where
the
counts
in
the
indictment
were
challenged
both
on
state
law
grounds
and
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
state
and
federal
constitutions.
the
county
court
judge
rejected
the
motion
on
the
ground
that
somehow
the
defendant
was
guilty
of
procuring
his
own
conviction,
repelled
division
the
second
departments,
appellate
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
new
york,
and
proceeding
in
the
nature
of
prohibition,
dismissed,
without
any
comment,
and
the
case
went
to
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals.
and
then
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals,
writing
for
a
four-judge
majority,
mr.
justice
titone
held
that
although
certain...
the
first...
the
manslaughter
vehicular
homicide
or
the
vehicular
assault
charges
in
the
indictment
survived,
a
blockburger-based
analysis
taking
hold
of
the
language
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
vitale
case,
the
majority's
observation
that
if
the
same
evidence
were
to
be
used
to
support
the
prosecution
on
the
homicide
charges,
there
would
be
a
substantial
constitutional
question.
and
seizing
upon
also,
the
language
in
the...
excuse
me...
dissenting
opinion,
that
to
quibble
with
the
characterization
of
the
substantiality
of
the
constitutional
question,
would
rather
simply
be
dispositive
of
the
constitutional
question
held
that
blockburger
notwithstanding
the
prosecution
in
this
case
is
barred
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
as
read
by
the
court
of
appeals
through
its
perception
of
the
view
of
this
court
as
barring
further
prosecution.
and
it
is
on
that
holding
that
we
come
to
this
court.
it
seems
that
of
the
protections
of
the
fifth
amendment
this
particular
aspect...
as
i
have
mentioned...
perhaps
over-enthusiastically,
and
i
apologize
for
that...
this
problem...
this
specific
problem
emerges
in
vitale
and
has
progressed
through
thigpen
where
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
thigpen
case
in
the
decision
below
mounted
the
sort
of
analysis
that
we
suggest
ought
be
followed,
that
was
followed
by
the
new
york
state
court
of
appeals,
that
was
followed
even
more
recently
in
a
case
we
cite
somewhat
frequently
in
the
brief,
connecticut
decision
of
state
v.
lonergan,
to
first
parse
the
statutes
themselves
as
written,
the
two
statutes
that
are
said
to
create
the
double
jeopardy
problem.
if
the
two
statutes
do
not
survive
a
blockburger-based
analysis
there,
the
double
jeopardy
inquiry
ends,
and
the
double
jeopardy
clause
precludes
prosecution...
a
second
prosecution.
the
prosecutor,
and
i
suspect,
any
prosecutor...
certainly
if
i
were
a
prosecutor...
would
look
to
have
the
inquiry
end
right
there.
and
if
that's
where
the
inquiry
ends,
then
that's
where
the
inquiry
ends.
but
it
seems,
from
vitale,
and
maybe
perhaps
by
precursor
language
in
the
brown
case
a
few
years
before
vitale,
that
blockburger
is
not
the
answer.
blockburger
is
an
answer,
an
answer.
the
answer
as
to
what
the
simple
language,
the
simple,
but
as
events
since
the
adoption
of
the
amendment
indicates,
complex
problems
presented
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
lies
in
looking
beyond
the
definitions,
looking
to
the
underlying
idea,
as
this
court
has
said
back
in
1957
in
the
oft-quoted
language
of
green
v.
the
united
states,
looking
to
the
deeply
ingrained
idea
that
the
state
with
all
its
power
should
not
be
allowed
to
make
repeated
attempts
to
convict
an
individual.
even
earlier...
i
take
that
back...
at
approximately
the
same
time
that
that
statement
was
made
by
this
court
in
its
opinion
in
green
v.
the
united
states
and
a
case
decided
a
few
years
earlier,
brock
v.
north
carolina,
writing
at
a
time
before
the
incorporation
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
fifth
amendment
into
the
jurisprudence
of
the
states,
mr.
justice
frankfurter
in
his
concurring
opinion
said
that
in
a
due
process
analysis...
in
a
due
process
analysis...
fairness
indicates
that
a
prosecutor
who
has
been
incompetent
or
casual
or
even
ineffective
shouldn't
be
given
an
opportunity
to
see
if
he
or
she
cannot
do
better
a
second
time.
it
is
the
second
time
aspect
that
raises
the
question
of
whether
there
isn't
even
a
third
level
beyond
which
the
prosecution
must
pass
before
the
prosecution
is
allowed
the
proceed
to
try
the
defendant
again
on
a
second
charge
where
the
factual
matrix
that
gives
rise
to
the
second
charge
is
sensibly
indistinguishable
from
the
first
prosecution.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
well--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
--mr.
justice
scalia,
doing
better
does
not
necessarily
mean
trying
to
win
again.
but
doing
better
can
also,
and
as
it
does
mean
very
often
the
civil
context
of
res
judicata
cases,
trying
to
get
a
better
result,
to
enhance
the
outcome
of
the
first
case.
trying
to
do
better
in
the
kind
of
callous
calculus
of
the
criminal
law,
a...
oh,
good
heavens...
a
conviction
for
a,
let's
say,
second-degree
crime
could
be
considered
not
doing
as
well
from
the
prosecutor's
point
of
view
as
getting
a
conviction
for
the
higher,
the
first
degree,
of
that.
and
i
think
the
language
bears
the
fair
construction
that
an
attempt
to
do
better
is
not
only
to
try
to
convict
the
defendant
who
has
once
been
acquitted,
but
to
perhaps
try
to
do
better
by
convicting
a
defendant
who's
been
once
acquitted
on
a
charge
that
arises
out
of
the
same
operable
set
of
facts,
by
convicting
him
over
yet
a
higher
degree
of
crime.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
it's...
it's
quite
clear,
your
honor,
in
the
cases
both
of
the
state
and
in
this
court,
that
if
the
prosecutor
does
not
have
available
all
of
the
information
needed
to
mount
the
particular
prosecution
under
attack,
then
the
double
jeopardy
clause
allows
a
prosecution
as...
as
i
understand
your
hypothetical,
the
so-called
later-death
cases.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
the
same-evidence
test,
as
we
would
envision
it
being
applied
in
this
case,
would
be
to
take
a
look
at
the
situation
as
the
prosecutor
knows
it
at
the
time
that
first
guilt-imposing
proceeding
is
ready
to
go
to
adjudication.
and
if
we
were
to
take
that
in
this
case,
and
look
at
what
the
prosecution
knew...
knew...
when
the
defendant
went
before
the
court,
the
prosecution
knew
that
it
had
evidence
of
intoxication.
it
knew
that
it
had
evidence
of
death.
it
knew
that
it
had
at
least
a
pretty
good
reason
to
consider
presenting
this
case
to
the
grand
jury.
because
we
are
told
by
the
prosecutor,
your...
mr.
chief
justice...
that
while
these
matters
were
percolating
through
the
justice's
court,
the
district
attorney's
office
wasn't
completely
asleep
in
this
case.
they
had
retained
an
accident
reconstructionist.
they
were
having
analyses
done
on
the
blood.
they
had
impounded
the
cars
that
were
involved
in
the
accident.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
how
that
could
happen,
but
i
think
that--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
--okay.
including
mine,
your
honor,
which
i
apologize
again.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
that
one,
your
honor,
i
think
i
would
have
to
say
they
had
the
information
at
the
time.
they
had
it.
they
had
it,
or
they
had
it
or
they
had
it
readily
available.
in
the
after-occurring
death
cases,
the
prosecution
may
have...
and
certainly
no
prosecutor's
going
to
be
sitting
around
saying,
gee,
i
hope
this
victim
dies
so
i
can
prosecute
this
guy
for
manslaughter.
that's...
that's
horrible.
but
if
this
is
what
eventuates,
if
the
prosecution
moves
ahead
and
moves
ahead
speedily
and
moves
ahead
intelligently
and
gets
the
conviction
for
what
is...
move
it
up
from
driving
while
intoxicated,
let's
move
it
up
to
a
high-level
felony
assault...
and
then
the
victim
dies,
it's
quite
clear
under
the
law
of
practically
every
state
that
i
can
confess
to
even
some
nodding
acquaintance
with...
it's
quite
clear
within
the
context
of
the
cases
decided
by
this
court
that
in
the
situation
where
the
death
of
the
victim
whose
injuries
were
the
subject
of
an
original
criminal
prosecution,
the
death
occurs
after...
after
conviction
of
the
assault-level
charges,
there's
no
problem.
there's
no
double
jeopardy
consequences,
if
for
no
other
reason,
there
is
no
possibility
of
ever
being
put
in
jeopardy
for
that
particular
crime
at
the
time
of
the
original
proceedings.
that
crime
had
one
regrettable
element
that
could
not
have
been...
could
not
have
been
asserted
in
the
original
proceeding.
in
this
unhappy
case,
all
the
information
that
was
needed
was
there
or
readily
obtainable
and
sitting
there
ticking
away
in
the
criminal
procedure
law
of
the
state
of
new
york
is
cpl
170.20.
cpl
170.20
gives
the
district
attorney's
office,
so
positioned
as
the
district
attorney's
office
in
dutchess
county
found
itself
with
this
case,
the
absolute
right
to
go
into
a
court
like
the
lagrange
town
court,
move
for
an
adjournment
on
the
ground
that
there
is
an
intention
to
submit
the
case
for
indictment.
and
the
statute
quite
clearly
says
that
the
judge,
justice
caplicki,
in
this
case,
must
grant...
must
grant--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
--if
we
were
to
replicate
this
case
in
illinois...
in
illinois,
where
apparently
this
is
not
necessary
because
that
is
how
illinois
v.
vitale
got
here...
if
we
were
to
replicate
this
case,
like
your
hypothetical
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
who
are
in
illinois,
i
would
suggest
that
the
approach
taken
in
vitale
might
have
to
be
re-examined
and
to
look
at...
and
look
for...
look
for...
for
this
court
to
look
for
in
the
proceedings
in
the
lower
courts
the
motion
to
dismiss,
let
us
say,
the
second
indictment,
any
hearings
that
are
held
on
that
second
indictment...
to
look
for
the
defense...
the
defense...
to
establish
beyond
at
least
any
reasonable
question...
not
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt...
but
to
establish
clearly
that
the
prosecution
can
move
ahead
only
on
the
same
evidence.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
i
suggest,
your
honor,
if
we
take
it
in
this
case
i
think
we
could
probably
call
the
investigating
officers,
we
could
call
forth
the
blood--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
--no,
your
honor.
but
in
a
very
simple,
straightforward...
on
terms
of
the
factual
context...
situation
like
the
one
presenting
us
in
this
case...
i
think
the
simple...
i
think
that
the
defendant
could
probably
meet
my
rather
favorable
standard
in
the
course
of
the
defense
by
demonstrating
the
reasonableness...
the
reasonableness...
of
the
assertion
that
there
is
no
rational
conclusion
to
be
reached
except
that
the
same
evidence
that
the
same
evidence
that
has
already
convicted
me
will
be
part,
parcel,
if
not
all
of
the
essential
meat
and
potatoes
of
the
prosecution's
case
against
me
on
this
second
go-round.
i'm
quite
mystified
that
the
illinois
criminal
procedure
law
is
equivalent...
doesn't
permit
the
kind
of
liberal
disclosure
in
advance
of
trial
that
is
permitted
under,
as
i
understand,
in
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure.
it
certainly
is
required
or
permitted
under
article
240
of
the
criminal
procedure
law
in
new
york.
there
might
be
a
little
preliminary
digging
that
might
have
to
be
done
by
the
defendant
to
make
out
the
same
evidence
argument,
but
i
don't
think
it
is
that
terribly
difficult
a
problem
for...
it
would
not
be
a
terribly
difficult
burden
to
impose
upon
defendants
to
bear
the...
if
not
the
onus
probandi,
at
least
the
burden
of
persuasion
that
the
same
evidence
will
be
used
in
the
second
prosecution.
and
then...
and
then...
and
then
we
have
set
the
stage
for
the
preliminary
attack
on
the
second
trial
which
this
court
has
since
abne
has
indicated
that
it
is
the
only
successful
or
satisfactory
way
of
resolving
the
problem
confronting
a
defendant
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
and
that
is
it's
all
very
well
and
good
to
say
that
it
was
a
double
jeopardy
clause,
but
if
you
want
to
establish
the
double
jeopardy
argument
the
defendant
has
to
undergo
the
travail,
run
the
gauntlet,
if
you
will,
to
borrow
off
the
language
of
this
court,
of
the
second
trial
to
make
out
his
or
her
double
jeopardy
argument,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
becomes
a
rather
unhelpful
piece
of
the
bill
of
rights
as
to--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
--well,
mr....
mr.
justice--
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
--yes,
mr.
justice
kennedy,
if
we
were
to
be
willing
to
rest
on
a
blockburger
first,
same...
evidence
test
second,
then
the
problem
of
the
same
transaction
would
not
be
solvable.
but
the
thrust
of
our
brief
is
that
there
are
at
least
three
identifiable
in
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court...
three
identifiable
tests...
screens,
if
you
will...
filters,
through
which
the
prosecution
must
pass.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
the
third
one
is
the
same
transaction
test,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
no,
sir,
and
it
has
been
pointed
out
that
the
court's
declination
to
adopt
that
test
has
been
characterized
in
one
of
this
court's
writings
as
a
steadfast
refusal
to
adopt
it.
but
i
would
like
to
take
the
time
that's
available
to
me
in
the
argument
to
suggest
that
perhaps
the
steadfastness
of
that
refusal
might
warrant
some
reexamination
in
this
case
adding
a
couple
of...
a
couple
of
additional
observations
to
what
has
probably
been
said
better,
and
said,
perhaps,
more
often,
and
perhaps
more
articulately
than
i
can
say
it.
but
there
is,
underlying
this
whole
double
jeopardy
problem
a
consideration
of
the
fairness
to
the
defendant,
who
is
facing
the
somewhat
awesome
power
of
the
court.
and
it
would
seem
if
one
were
to
take
general
approach
of
a
state
statute
like
cpl
article
40
which
says
if
you've
got
the
material,
put
it
all
in
one
indictment
and
prosecute.
like
the
suggestions
made
in
the
model
penal
code
that
are
cited
in
our
brief
in
opposition
to
the
petition
of
certiorari,
like
the
cites
in
the
american
bar
association...
i
think
project
for
minimum
standards
of
criminal
justice...
that
where
there
is,
as
we
also
say
in
the
brief
in
the
civil
case,
the
reasonable
expectation...
the
reasonable
expectation
that...
by
the
bench
and
by
the
bar
that
these
claims
would
all
be
asserted
in
a
single
vehicle,
then
that
reasonable
expectation
is
part
of
the
reasonableness
that
is
inherent
in
the
term
fairness.
and
the
fairness
that
is
inherent
in
the
system
is
translated
in
this
context
into
a...
an
adoption
of
principles
of
res
judicata,
collateral
estoppel,
borrowed
quite
clearly
and
liberally
from
the
civil
side
into
this
specific
problem
presented
by
cases
like
this.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
ashe
v.
swenson.
mr.
richard
t.
farrell
mr.
chief
justice,
i
apologize,
again,
for
my
enthusiasm,
my
excesses.
thank
you
very
much.
