justice
kennedy
but
i...
i
take
it
from
the
opinion
of
the
state
court
that
the
prosecution
is
bound
by
its
pleadings
in
its
bill
of
particulars.
and
so,
we
can
take
this
case
as
one
in
which
the
only
way
the
prosecution
can
prove
its
case
is
to
prove
the
same
matters
that
were
shown
in
the
earlier
proceeding
on
which
there
has
now
been
a
judgment.
justice
kennedy
is...
is
that
correct?
justice
kennedy
well,
there
are
some
additional
factors
but,
really,
the
essential
part
of
the
prosecution's
case
is
going
to
rely
on
the
matters
that
were
concluded
by
the
traffic
offense
in
the
traffic
court.
is
that
not
correct?
justice
kennedy
oh,
well,
of
course--
justice
kennedy
--there
will
be
differences,
but
the
state
says
the
major
part
of
the
case
is
the
same.
that's
what
the
state--
justice
kennedy
--that's
what
your
state
court
says.
justice
kennedy
so...
so
don't
we
take
the
case
as
one
in
which
in
the
second
trial
the
proof
is
going
to
be
of
the
same
facts
that
were
proven
in
the
first
trial?
justice
kennedy
well,
are
you...
are
you
suggesting
the
case
would
have
different
if
there
had
been
a
trial
and
the
prosecution
had
introduced
all
this
evidence?
justice
kennedy
well,
what's
the
legal...
what's
the
legal
difference?
justice
kennedy
but
we
do
know
because
your
state
court
has
told
us.
justice
kennedy
so
i
think
you
have
to
tell
us
why
that
does
not
constitute
a
bar.
justice
kennedy
but...
but
your
answer
is
there
would
be
no
federal
constitutional
impediment
to
the
four
trials?
justice
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
consequence
of
your
test.
that
we're
not...
unless
you
adopt
the
transaction
test...
but
if...
if
you
adopt
something
short
of
that,
as
you
propose,
you're
not
going
to
know
about
double
jeopardy
unless,
one,
you
wait
for
the
second
trial
to
actually
proceed,
or,
two,
you
have
some
sort
of
mandatory
bill
of
particulars.
justice
kennedy
and
i'm...
i'm
not
talking
necessarily
about
this
case
because
we
seem
to
know
in
this
case
what's
going
to
happen.
