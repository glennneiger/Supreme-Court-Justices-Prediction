chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-474,
william
v.
grady
v.
thomas
j.
corbin.
mrs.
steller,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
justice
court
to
which
you
refer,
mrs.
steller,
so
far
as
what
kind
of
crimes
can
it
hear
pleas
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
binding
over,
in
effect?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that's
because
each
has
an
element
that
the
other
doesn't
have?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mrs.
steller.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
farrell,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
may
be
latin
and
old,
but
how
do
we
know
it's
deeply
rooted
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause?
chief
justice
rehnquist
just...
just...
just
a
minute
mr.
steller.
when
a
justice
answers...
mr.
farrell,
when
a
justice
asks
you
a
question,
you...
you
don't
say,
yes,
sir.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
i...
i
suggest
you
adjust
your
entire
demeanor
to
that
of
a
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
farrell,
what
if
the
death
here
had
occurred
several
months
after
the...
after
the
accident
so
that
at
the
time
your
client
was
prosecuted
for
the
misdemeanor
charges
in
the
justice
court
there
had
been
no
death?
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
how...
how...
how
does
that
fit
in
under
your
version
of
the...
the
same-evidence
test?
chief
justice
rehnquist
under
your
theory,
i
take
it,
if
the
state
were
to
have
come
several
months
later
on
evidence
of
intoxication
which
it
didn't
have
at
first,
then
there
would
be
an
exception
for
that
too
just
like
there
would
be
for
a
later
death?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
just
take
it
as
a
hypothetical.
i
mean,
there
seemed
to
have
been
enough
slip-ups
in
this
case
so
we
can
envision
one
more.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
supposing
you're
in
a
jurisdiction
where
the
state
was
not
obligated
to
or
didn't
in
fact
submit
a
bill
of
particulars.
how
would
you
handle
your
same
evidence
test
on
a
double
jeopardy
argument
if...
if
the
state
indicts
on
the...
on
the
greater
offense?
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
how
would
the
defense
go
about
establishing
that?
would
they
call
the
prosecutor
to
the
witness
stand?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
they...
they
could
certainly
give
you
testimony
as
to
what
happened,
but
i
would
think
there
would
be
no
guarantee
that
the
state
would
necessarily
use
all
the
testimony
of
the
investigating
officers.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
third?
what
is
the
third...
was
the
third
one
the
same-transaction
test?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
never
been
adopted
by
the
court,
has
it?
it's
been
rejected
several
times.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
farrell.
mrs.
steller,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mrs.
steller.
the
case
is
submitted.
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
