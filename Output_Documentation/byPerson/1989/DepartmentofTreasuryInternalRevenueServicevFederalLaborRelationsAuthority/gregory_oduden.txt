mr.
gregory
o'duden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--the
question
why
we
want
the
proposal
in
the
contract?
there
are
very
sound,
practical
reasons
for
why
we
need
this
kind
of
proposal
in
the
contract.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
no,
we
certainly
could.
let
me
explain
to
you
why...
why
we
would
want
to
make
such
a
proposal.
it
is
common
practice
in
the
federal
sector
to
incorporate
important
regulatory
provisions
right
into
the
contract.
that...
that's
just
the
way
things
are
done.
so
much
of
the
employment
relationship
in
the
federal
sector,
after
all,
is
determined
by
laws,
rules
and
regulations.
the
contracts
are
largely
enforced
and
administered
by
lay
people.
it
helps
them
to
a
great
extent
to
have
these
very
important
laws,
rules
and
regulations
in
the
contract
so
that
they
can
see
what
the
relevant
provisions
are,
so
that
they
can
be
guided
by
them.
furthermore,
it
helps
employees
because
it
puts
the
employer
agency
on
notice
that
this
is
a
rule...
this
is
a
regulation
that
you
are
going
to
have
to
follow.
and
we
hope
that
it
thereby
encourages
compliance
with
these
kinds
of
rules
and
regulations.
and
furthermore,
as
my
friend
with
the
flra
has
already
pointed
out,
it
helps
avoid
future
disputes
about
whether
something
is
arbitrable.
so
there
are
very
sound
practical
reasons
why
we
would
make
such
a
proposal,
and
indeed
it
is
every
day
practice
in
the
federal
sector.
next,
let
me
address
the
irs'
contention
that
the
applicable
laws
language
in
7106
should
be
read
to
have
a
narrower
scope
than
laws,
rules
and
regulations.
we
have
heard
them
concede
today
that
the
a-76
circular
is
indeed
a
rule
within
the
meaning
of
the
grievance
procedure,
but
they
say
that
is
not
good
enough.
they
suggest
that
we
have
to
show
something
more
than
that.
and
we
would
submit
that
that
is
untenable.
there
are
many
rules,
many
rules
in
the
federal
sector,
for
example
those
in
the
federal
personnel
manual,
that
have
always
been
routinely
grievable,
but
under
the
irs'
construction
of
the
statute,
they
would
read
applicable
laws
to
cancel
out
the
express
statutory
right
to
file
grievances
over
those
rules.
to
put
it
a
somewhat
different
way,
under
the
irs'
construction
of
the
statute,
and
we
believe
it
is
a
rather
strange
one,
it
would
mean
that
the
agency
actually
has
a
right
to
violate
rules
and
regulations
that
do
not
meet
its
definition
of
applicable
law.
and
we
would
say
that
that
is
an
untenable...
an
untenable
view
of
the
statute,
indeed.
finally,
let
me
add
that
even
if
the
government,
the
irs,
were
somehow
correct
here,
that
we
had
to
demonstrate
that
the
circular
was
a
regulation
with
the
force
of
law,
that
is,
a
substantive
rule
or
a
legislative
rule,
and
we
would
emphasize
that
we
do
not
believe
that
that
is
our
burden
here,
but
even
if
that
were
correct
we
would
strongly
suggest
that
we
meet
even
that
most
stringent
test.
and
let
me
explain
why.
first
of
all,
what
we
have
here
is
a
circular
that
was
issued
pursuant
to
statutory
authority.
it
is
unquestionably
binding
on
executive
agencies.
they
gave
notice,
they
asked
for
comment,
they
held
hearings
and,
perhaps
most
important,
they
incorporated
the
provisions
of
a-76
right
into
the
code
of
federal
regulations
within
the
subpart
that
describes
the
federal
acquisition
regulations.
if
that
isn't
a
substantive
rule
or
regulation,
i
suppose
i
am
not
sure
what
is.
so,
for
these
reasons
we
would
say
that
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
the
a-76
circular
is
indeed
a
law,
rule
or
regulation
within
the
meaning
of
the
grievance
procedure,
which
we
would
submit
controls
here,
or
it
is
an
applicable
law
even
under
the
irs'
most
stringent
definition.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
i
would
say
you
do,
your
honor.
i
would
say--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--that
the
flra--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--is
entitled
to
great
deference
here,
as
your
honor
well
knows.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
gregory
o'duden
you
have
said
that
in
the
batf
case,
your
honor.
it
is
a
well
established
principle
of
course
that
the
administrative
agency
charged
with
interpreting
the
statute
is
entitled
to
deference,
unless
its
views
are
clearly
unreasonable.
and
that
clearly
is
not
the
case
here.
perhaps
it
would
help
me
to
spend
just
a
moment
to
talk
a
bit
about
the
relationship
of
the
management
rights
clause
and
the
grievance
procedure,
because
i
think
that
perhaps
there
is
some
uncertainty
as
to
how
these
two
provisions
fit
together.
the
management
rights
clause
is
there
to
protect
management's
authority
to
make
substantive
decisions.
it
insulates
management
from
having
to
bargain
about
substantive
rules.
the
grievance
arbitration
procedure
has
an
entirely
different
scope.
it
says
that
to
the
extent
that
management
is
already
bound
by
rules
and
regulations,
even
those
that
you
couldn't
bargain
about,
it
is
bound
to
follow
them.
and
it
gives
employees
the
right
to
file
grievances
whenever--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--management
steps
out
of
line.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
it
is
not
the...
it
is
not
the
circular
that
makes
anything
grievable,
your
honor.
it
is
the
statute
that
does
that.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
oh,
i
agree
that
it
is
necessary
for
us
to
have
the
circular
here
in
order
to
pursue
a
successful
grievance,
because
without
the
circular
there
would
be
no
binding
requirements
on
the
agencies.
so
the
circular
is
important--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--the
circular
itself
says
that
it
does
not
apply
if
it
is
inconsistent
with
law.
so
omb
is
indeed--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--it
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
it
cannot
override
a
determination--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--well--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--it
might,
i
suppose--
mr.
gregory
o'duden
--no,
i
don't
want
to
give
it
away.
certainly
not,
your
honor.
i
suppose
that
would
enter
into
the
calculation
of
whether
it
is
a
binding
rule
with
the
force
of
law.
mr.
gregory
o'duden
it
is
conceivable,
of
course.
but
in
the
end,
of
course,
a
determination
as
to
whether
something
is
a
binding
rule
for
purposes
of
the
apa
does
not
turn
alone
on
the
agency's
characterization
of
the
rule
or
regulation.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
more
to
add.
thank
you
very
much.
