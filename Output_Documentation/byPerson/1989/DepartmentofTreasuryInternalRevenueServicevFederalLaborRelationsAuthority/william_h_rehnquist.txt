h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
88-2123,
the
department
of
the
treasury,
internal
revenue
service
v.
federal
labor
relations
authority.
mr.
shapiro.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
mr.
englehart.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
englehart,
what's
your
answer
to
the
solicitor
general's
argument
that
when
the
section
7106(a)
defines
management
rights
it
says
nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
detract
from
it,
and
that
the
definition
of
grievance
is
in
this
chapter?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
are
really
just
picking
and
choosing
what
you
want
out
of
the
circular,
aren't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
don't
you
have
to
persuade
us
too
that
7106(a)(2),
in
accordance
with
applicable
laws,
means
laws,
rules
and
regulations?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yet
this
case
isn't
about
grieving.
it's
about
what
can
be
bargained,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
thought
the
issue...
the
issue
raised...
i
thought
the
issue
decided
by
the
court
of
appeals
was
whether
the
treasury
can
be
required
to
bargain
about
this.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--your
time
has
expired,
mr.
englehart.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
o'duden.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
o'duden.
mr.
shapiro,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shapiro.
the
case
is
submitted.
