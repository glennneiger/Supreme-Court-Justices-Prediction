mr.
david
l.
shapiro
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
federal
agency
can
be
required
to
bargain
over
a
union
proposal
that
would
subject
certain
agency
decisions
with
respect
to
the
contracting
out
of
agency
work
to
the
grievance
procedure
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
to
third-party
arbitration.
the
agency
position,
that
is,
the
position
of
the
internal
revenue
service
in
this
case,
has
been
that
it
cannot
be
required
to
bargain
over
this
proposal,
that
indeed,
bargaining
over
the
proposal
is
precluded
by
the
management
rights
provision
of
the
federal
labor
management
relations
statute.
the
union
proposal
in
this
case
is
related
to
circular
a-76,
issued
by
the
office
of
management
and
budget,
which
is
an
arm
of
the
executive
office
of
the
president.
circular
a-76
was
originally
issued
in
the
early...
in
the
1950s
and
has
been
amended
a
number
of
times
ever
since.
it
is
a
statement
of
executive
policy
on
the
important
matter
of
federal
procurement.
it
deals
in
some
detail
with
the
circumstances
under
which
the
particular
work
shall
be
done
inside
the
agency
or
shall
be
contracted
out.
the
circular
specifically
states
not
only
that
it
is
designed
to
give
administrative
direction
to
heads
of
agencies,
but,
and
i
quote,
that
it
"shall
not
establish
and
shall
not
be
construed
to
create
any
substantive
or
procedural
basis
for
anyone
to
challenge
any
agency
action
or
inaction
on
the
basis
that
it
was
not
in
accordance
with
the
circular,
except
as
specifically
provided
in
the
circular
itself.
"
the
circular
then
goes
on--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--well,
the
core
of
our
argument,
your
honor,
is
that
circular
a-76
is
not
an
applicable
law
within
the
meaning
of
the
management
rights
provision.
so
that
if
circular
a-76
did
confer
third-party
rights
that
would
be
enforceable
in
court,
then
that
threshold
aspect
of
our
argument
would
be
crossed,
and
you
would
come
to
the
latter
part
of
our
argument
that
the
subject
matter
of
the
circular
is
excluded
from
bargaining
by
section
7117--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--no,
it's
really...
i
believe
it's
a
subsidiary
part.
we
reach
it
really
only
at
the
latter
point
of
our
brief.
the
focus
of
our
argument
is
really
that
circular
a-76
is
not
an
applicable
law.
we
do
make
both
arguments.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes,
we
do,
your
honor,
although
we
think
that
question
need
be
reached
only
if
the
court
determines
that
it
is
an
applicable
law
under
7106.
we
do
believe,
however,
that
there
is
a
considerable
difference
between
the
scope,
purpose
and
language
of
7117
on
the
one
hand
and
the
scope
and
language
of
7106
on
the
other.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
there
are
three
relevant
provisions
of
this
statute,
your
honor.
there
is
the
definition
of
a
grievance,
in
section
7103,
which
refers
very
broadly
to
any
complaint
of
any
violation
of
a
law,
rule
or
regulation.
there
is
section
7117,
which
excludes
from
the
scope
of
bargaining
any
proposal
that
is
inconsistent
with
any
governmentwide
rule
or
regulation.
now,
it
may
be
that
the
concept
of
a
rule
in
those
two
provisions
is
the
same.
we
content
in
our
brief
that
it
is
not.
but
it
may
be
that
it
is.
congress
has
indicated
in
the
legislative
history
that
it
regards
a
government
policy
statement
as
within
the
scope
of
7117.
but
the
third
provision
of
the
act,
and
the
one
in
which
we
place
our
central
reliance,
is
the
management
rights
provision
of
7106.
that
section
does
not
use
the
words
rule
or
regulation.
it
speaks
only
of
applicable
laws.
and
in
our
view
the
scope
and
purpose
of
that
section
is
very
different.
now,
there
is,
as
i
say,
a
reference
in
circular
a-76
to
an
internal
appeals
procedure
within
the
agency
itself
that
agencies
are
required
to
create.
but
that
internal
appeals
procedure,
as
spelled
out
in
the
circular,
is
not
to
authorize
an
appeal
outside
the
agency
or
judicial
review,
and
it
is
provided
that
it
may
not
be
subject
to
negotiation,
arbitration
or
agreement.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
no,
i
think
it
is...
i
think
it
is
inherent
in
the
agency's
appropriations
that
certain
kinds
of
functions
may
be
performed
either
in-house
or
by
contracting
out.
but
i
don't
believe
the
authority
to
contract
out
comes
from
the
circular.
the
circular
is
a
statement
of
policy
about
how
existing
authority
is
to
be
exercised.
the
circular
does
in
fact
purport
to
preclude
contracting
out
of
certain
kinds
of
governmental
functions.
but
the
circular,
i
don't
believe,
is
the
source
of
authority.
i
think
the
government's
authority
to
contract
out
predates
the
circular,
which
goes
back
only
to
the
1950s.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
think
the
authority
of
the
agency
exists
even
if
there
were
no
circular.
the
circular
is
defined...
designed
to
give
the
agency
direction
with
respect
to
the
exercise
of
that
authority.
and
so,
when
the
agency
follows
a-76,
it
is
making
determinations
with
respect
to
contracting
out.
the
agency
isn't...
i'm
sorry,
the
circular
is
a
direction
to
federal
agencies.
i
think
i
was
only
trying
to
suggest
that
the
authority
to
contract
out
predates
the
publication
of
the
circular,
and
i
believe
would
exist
even
if
there
were
no
circular.
but
the
circular
is
designed
to
direct
the
exercise
of
that
authority.
the
union
proposal
in
this
case
was
a
proposal,
and
i
quote
it
at
this
point,
that
the
"internal
appeals
procedure
of
the
circular
shall
be
the
grievance
and
arbitration
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
"
the
agency
refused
to
bargain
over
that,
holding
that
bargaining
was
precluded
by
the
management
rights
provision.
the
federal
labor
relations
authority
upheld
the
union's
claim
that
the
proposal
was
subject
to
bargaining.
the
matter
was
taken
to
the
d.c.
circuit
court
of
appeals,
which
held
two
to
one
that
the
agency
was
correct.
in
that
decision,
the
d.c.
circuit
was
coming
down
with
a
result
that
was
diametrically
opposed
to
the
en
banc
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit,
as
well
as
to
the
rationale
of
a
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
so
that
decision
was
brought
here
for
review.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
your
honor,
we
do
rely
on
that
provision,
but--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--well
no,
quite
explicitly
in
our
brief
on
page
38.
it
is
not
the
core
of
our
argument.
the
flra
has
an
answer
to
that
argument
which
we
believe
is
not
correct.
i
don't
want
to
make
it
for
them,
but
to
summarize
it
very
briefly
it
is
that
since
circular
a-76
is
a
rule
or
regulation,
the
authority
to
subject
decisions
under
it
to
the
grievance
procedure
and
arbitration
exists
under
the
federal
labor
management
relations
statute.
7117,
they
say,
only
operates
to
preclude
certain
matters
from
negotiation,
but
not
from
the
operation
of
the
grievance
procedure
or
the
arbitration
provision.
we
contend
that
that
position
is
incorrect.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
that's
right,
and
indeed
that
is
their
argument.
their
argument
here
is
that
the
union
proposal
is
superfluous,
that
the
authority
to
go
to
the
grievance
procedure
and
arbitration
would
exist
even
without
it.
in
fact,
the
flra's
position
here
is
that
this
case
essentially
is
resolved
by
the
definition
of
a
grievance
in
section
7103.
they
say
that
because
the
concept
of
a
grievance
has
such
a
broad
definition,
any
matter
relating
to
subcontracting,
in
effect,
can
be
taken
to
arbitration
without
regard
to
the
management
rights
provision.
indeed,
as
i
read
their
argument,
they
are
saying
that
the
definition
of
a
grievance
overrides
the
management
rights
provision.
that
the
management
rights
provision,
they
say,
comes
into
play
only
insofar
as
it
may
exercise
a
constraint
on
the
arbitrator's
decision.
that
the
arbitrator
may
not
substitute
his
judgment
for
that
of
a
federal
agency
in
matters
of
discretion.
now,
on
this
score,
that
is,
reading
the
grievance
procedure
in
effect
to
override
the
threshold
provisions
of
the
management
rights
provision,
there
is
a
very
fundamental
disagreement
between
the
flra
and
the
federal
agency
employer
in
this
case
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
the
construction
and
purpose
of
the
statute.
we
believe
the
flra
is
incorrect
for
two
essential
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
definition
of
a
grievance
is
very
broad.
it
covers
not
only
any
complaint
involving
the
violation
of
a
rule
or
regulation,
but
also,
as
the
union
quite
happily
points
out,
covers
any
complaint
involving
any
matter
relating
to
employment.
so
that
if
the
definition
of
a
grievance
overrode
the
management
rights
provision,
it
would
be
not
only
that
any
complaint
of
violation
of
circular
a-76
could
be
taken
to
arbitration,
but
any
complaint
about
subcontracting,
even
if
there
were
no
circular
a-76,
because,
as
we
concede,
a
complaint
about
subcontracting
is
a
complaint
about
a
matter
relating
to
employment.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
grievance
definition
can
override
the
management
rights
provision
in
that
way.
indeed,
the
management
rights
provision
itself
makes
it
clear
that
that
cannot
be
so.
the
management
rights
provision,
section
7106,
which
is
an
essential
part
of
this
statute
in
terms
of
the
very
special
needs
of
the
government,
states
that
subject
to
subsection
(b)
of
this
section,
nothing
in
this
chapter,
and
that
includes
the
definition
of
a
grievance,
nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
affect
the
authority
of
any
management
official
of
any
agency
in
accordance
with
applicable
law
to
make
determinations
with
respect
to
contracting
out.
now,
in
our
view,
that
means
that
determinations
with
respect
to
contracting
out,
which
is
what
we
have
in
this
case,
can
be
subject
to
the
act
despite
the
management
rights
provision
only
in
two
circumstances.
one
is
if
it
falls
within
subsection
(b)
of
the
management
rights
provision.
no
such
contention
is
made
here
by
the
flra
or
the
union.
the
other
is--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--subsection
(b),
7106
(b).
nothing
in
this
section
shall
preclude
any
agency
from
negotiating.
subsection
(1)
deals
with
matters
that
the
election
of
the
agency--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--is
not
applicable
here.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
subsection
(2)
deals
with
procedures,
and
it
has
never
been
contended
that
that
is
what's
involved
here.
subsection
(3)
deals
with
the
impact
or
effect
of
a
determination
but
not
with
the
determination
itself.
the
other
ground
on
which
a
matter
might
be
excluded
from
the
coverage
of
the
management
rights
provision
is
if
the
question
is
one
of
conformity
with
an
applicable
law.
if
it
is,
then,
justice
scalia,
we
come
to
the
argument
that
we
have
made
under
7117.
but
we
contend,
in
accordance
with
every
lower
court
judge
who
has
discussed
this
issue,
that
circular
a-76
is
not
an
applicable
law
within
the
meaning
of
the
management
rights
provision.
and
we
contend
that
for
several
reasons,
which
we
think
are
evident
from
the
face
of
the
document
itself,
from
its
source,
from
its
purpose
and
from
its
application.
to
begin
with,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
the
document
itself
makes
it
clear
that
it
is
intended
as
a
directive
from
a
superior
to
a
subordinate
for
the
guidance
of
that
subordinate,
and
that
it
is
not
designed
to
create
any
third-party
rights
or
enforceable
duties.
it
says
specifically
that
it
shall
not
be
construed
to
create
any
basis
for
anyone
to
challenge
any
agency
action.
now,
it
is
not
simply
the
evident
purpose
of
the
document
that
we
believe
leads
to
that
conclusion,
it
is
the
nature
of
the
document.
it
is
the
fact
that
the
document
is
issued
as
a
policy
directive
on
a
matter
of
procurement
policy
by
a
branch
of
the
executive
office
of
the
president,
which
is
the
president's
principal
arm
for
the
exercise
of
his
managerial
functions.
it
is
a
document
that
necessarily
contains
in
it
a
great
deal
of
delegated
discretion,
that
is...
is
essential
for
the
effective
operation
of
this
document
that
agency
heads
bring
their
expert
judgment
to
bear
on
these
decisions.
and
it
is
a
document
which
it's
clear
purpose
and
effect
is
designed
essentially
as
any
order
from
a
superior
to
a
subordinate
would
be
designed.
it
is,
in
other
words,
in
our
view,
the
exercise
of
the
very
kind
of
managerial
prerogative
that
section
7106
is
designed
to
preserve.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
no,
we
do...
we
do
concede
that,
your
honor,
that
regulations
having
the
force
of
law
would
be
applicable
laws.
we
don't
believe
that
this
is
such
a
regulation.
we
believe
it
is
a
policy
statement
which
has
always
been
viewed
by
the
courts,
which
views
itself,
which
is
designed
simply
as
an
instruction
from
a
superior
to
a
subordinate.
we
do
not
believe
that
congress
intended,
in
using
the
phrase
applicable
law,
to
permit
the
vehicle
of
the
exercise
of
managerial
discretion
to
become
the
instrument
for
eliminating
managerial
discretion.
and
for
that
reason
we
ask
that
the
judgment
below
be
reversed.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
specifically,
your
honor--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--specifically,
your
honor,
i
am
not
aware
that
a
particular
statement
that
says
that
the
management
rights
provision
itself
limits
the
scope
of
what
is
grievable
or
subject
to
arbitration.
indeed,
there
are
some
ambiguous
statements
that
are
very
heavily
relied
on
by
the
union
and
the
flra,
by
representatives
udall
and
ford,
that
might
be
read
the
other
way.
i
may
address
those
for
a
minute.
in
the
first
place,
we
don't
believe
that
these
ambiguous
statements
could
possibly
override
the
very
clear
language
of
the
chapter
on
the
provision
that
says
nothing
in
this
chapter,
including
the
definition
of
a
grievance.
in
the
second
place,
the
statement
by
representative
ford
was
made
after
the
enactment
of
the
statute,
and
this
court
has
recognized
that
post-enactment
statements
are
not...
do
not
throw
any
light
on
the
intent
or
purpose
of
the
statute.
and
finally,
we
think
the
statements
can
fairly
be
read
simply
as
saying
that
if
a
question
of
conformity
with
applicable
law
does
arise,
that
then
the
grievance
and
arbitration
provisions
of
the
statute
may
come
into
play.
thank
you.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
few
points.
first
of
all,
if
the
flra's
position
in
this
case
is
correct,
the
union's
bargaining
proposal
is
not
simply
superfluous,
it
is
far
narrower
than
the
actual
matters
that
can
be
grieved
and
taken
to
arbitration,
because
it
is
not
limited
to
matters
covered
by
the
internal
appeals
procedure.
it
would
embrace
all
matters
within
the
circular,
and
indeed
any
decision
with
respect
to
subcontracting.
second,
we
have
been,
i
think,
accused
of
making
several
concessions
that
we
have
never
made.
we
do
not
concede
that
the
term
"applicable
laws"
is
to
be
given
the
same
meaning
as
the
term
"law,
rule
or
regulation"
elsewhere
in
the
statute.
we
believe
that
the
flra's
reading
of
the
grievance
definition
is
too
broad,
but
we
contend
quite
vigorously
that,
whatever
the
proper
reading
of
that
definition,
the
phrase
applicable
laws
is
considerably
narrower
in
its
purpose
and
scope.
finally,
i--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--your
honor,
if
we
start
with
the
use
of
the
phrase
laws,
rules
or
regulations
in
7117,
congress
indicated
there
that
they
regarded
the
phrase
to
be
broad
enough
to
include
governmentwide
policy
directives.
they
did
not
want
the
parties
bargaining
in
matters
inconsistent
with
governmentwide
policy
directives
on
any
subject.
but
when
they
use
the
phrase
applicable
laws
in
7106,
we
contend
that
they
meant
only
statutes
and
regulations
having
the
force
of
law
in
the
sense
that
they
conferred
enforceable
rights
and
duties.
we
do
not
believe
that
phrase
embraces
policy
statements
of
the
kind
involved
here.
now,
i
think
perhaps
the
critical
difference
between
the
irs
and
the
authority
here
is
with
respect
to
the
role
the
management
rights
provision
plays.
as
i
understand
the
authority's
position,
it
is
that
all
that
the
management
rights
provision
does
is
to
exercise
constraint
on
arbitrators
when
they
are
deciding
cases.
they
should
not
interfere
with
managerial
discretion.
we
contend
that
the
management
rights
provision,
when
it
is
fully
applicable,
must
go
to
the
threshold
question
of
grievability,
arbitrability,
as
well
as
negotiability.
that
the
management
rights
provision
means
that
managerial
decisions,
whether
they
are
discretionary
or
not,
should
not
be
turned
over
to
a
third-party
decision
maker.
and
the...
what
happened
in
the
blytheville
case,
which
is
an
example
of
the
consequences
of
that
kind
of
authorization,
we
believe
strongly
supports
our
position.
and
indeed,
major
ketler,
who
discusses
the
blytheville
case
in
detail
in
the
only
study
i
know
of
this
problem,
agrees
with
us
that
there
was
in
that
case
a
significant
arbitral
interference
which
was
upheld
by
the
flra
with
the
exercise
of
managerial
authority.
in
other
words,
the
key
to
this
case
for
us
is
that
the
management
rights
provision,
when
it
is
fully
applicable,
as
it
is
here
because
none
of
the
exceptions
in
the
provision
apply,
that
provision
excludes
not
only
negotiability
but
grievability
and
arbitrability.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
but
that
would
be
a
painful
act,
your
honor,
because
this
is
a
very
important
directive
by
the
president
to
the
heads
of
agencies
about
how
procurement
policy
is
to
be
conducted.
so
it
might
get
us
out
of
this
case,
but
it
would
get
us
into--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--not
an
applicable
law,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
a
directive
that
has
to
be
followed,
as
any
order
from
a
superior
to
a
subordinate
must
be
followed,
not
in
the
sense
of
creating
externally
enforceable
rights
or
duties.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
as
i
understand--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--as
i
understand
it,
the
only
thing
the
president
can
do
is
to
exercise
the
authority
that
any
superior
can
exercise
over
subordinate,
which
is
to
see
to
it
that
the
insubordinate
person
is
somehow
disciplined
for
insubordination.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
this
applies
to
executive
agencies,
as
i
understand
it.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
it
applies
to
agencies
that
are
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
executive
branch.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
in
the
sense,
i
suppose,
that
a
superior
can
overlook
insubordination
by
a
subordinate,
if
it
chooses.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
yes.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
i
don't
it
could
allow...
i
think
bargaining
over
this
is
fairly
precluded,
in
our
view.
there
are
certain
elections--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--yes,
but
i
don't
think
contracting
out
is
included.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
and
in
any
event,
i
don't
think
an
agency...
that
is,
if
an
agency
were
to
choose
to
bargain
over
some--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
don't
think
that
the
decision
to
turn
over
management
authority
to
a
third-party
arbitrator
would
be
bargaining
over
procedure.
indeed,
the
flra
has
never
suggested
that
(b)(2)
is
broad
enough
to
cover
this
case.
if
an
agency
were
to
decide
that
its
election
to
bargain
in
violation
of
a-76,
that
might
well
be
an
act
of
insubordination
with
respect
to
the
direction
of
the
circular
itself.
if
there
are
no
more--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
think
it
would
depend
on
a
close
analysis
of
the
circular
to
determine
whether
it
was
an
applicable
law.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
well,
what
is
in
effect
is
the...
federal
personnel
manual,
which
covers
a
whole
wall
on
people's
bookshelves.
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
as
a
whole,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
i
could
answer
that
question.
i
think
that
there
is
one
critical
difference
between
the
manual
and
this
circular,
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
general
statement
at
the
outset
that
it
is
not
intended
to
or
designed
to
create
any
enforceable
rights.
particular
questions
about
the
federal
personnel
manual
have
arisen
in
the
flra,
but
to
my
knowledge
so
far
have
not
been
resolved
in
the
courts
of
appeals.
i
think
it
would
turn
on
the
extent
to
which
those
provisions
were
applicable
laws.
they
are,
of
course,--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
think--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
think
if--
mr.
david
l.
shapiro
--i
think
if
a
private
party
could
bring
an
apa
action,
that
that
would
be
very
strong,
if
not
conclusive,
evidence
that
the...
you
are
dealing
with
an
applicable
law.
it
might
be
that
you
have
procedures
that
can
fairly
be
considered
to
confer
enforceable
rights
and
duties
and
ways
that
do
not
include
judicial
review.
there
may
be
such
cases,
and
i
don't
want
to
exclude
them
from
possibility.
thank
you,
your
honor.
