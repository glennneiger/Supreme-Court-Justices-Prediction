justice
scalia
excuse
me.
that
last
point
is
really
not
essential
to
your
principal
argument
here,
though,
is
it?
even
if
it
had...
even
if
it
had
not
included
that
provision,
even
if
you
were
allowed
to
imply
that
there
might
be
some
binding
effect
in
the
courts,
your
main
argument
would
be
unaffected,
wouldn't
it?
justice
scalia
xxx
to
be
the
principal
part
of
your
argument.
justice
scalia
mr.
shapiro,
while
you
are
pausing
for
liquid
refreshment,
why...
why
doesn't
the
government
rely
on
section
(a)(1)
of
7117,
which
simply
says
that
the
duty
to
bargain
in
good
faith
doesn't
extend
to
matters
which
are
the
subject
of
a
rule
or
regulation,
if
the
rule
or
regulation
is
a
governmentwide
rule
or
regulation,
which
this
is?
justice
scalia
very
subtly.
justice
scalia
well,
that
argument
would
mean
it's
in
the
arbitration
provision
automatically,
but
you
don't
have
to
bargain
to
put
it
in
here
[inaudible].
justice
scalia
xxx
subsection
(b)
of
the
management
rights
provision
being--
justice
scalia
--okay.
justice
scalia
right,
right,
right.
justice
scalia
mr.
shapiro,
does
the
government
concede
that
applicable
laws
can
include
regulations?
i
mean,
i...
that's
essentially
what
your
argument
seems
to
concede.
justice
scalia
but
it
doesn't
say
law,
rule
or
regulation.
that
is
your
position,
that
they
have
no
right,
except
in
accordance
with
applicable
law,
rules
and
regulations,
to
do
these
things.
but
all
the
statute
says
is
that
it
shall
not
affect
the
right
of
the
management
official
in
accordance
with
applicable
laws
to
assign
work.
justice
scalia
but
surely...
you
keep
saying
law,
rule
or
regulation,
but
surely
the
statute
means
something,
when
in
some
sections
it
very
explicitly
says
laws,
rules
and
regulations,
as
it
does
in...
in
7103(a)(9)(c)(ii),
for
example,
another
one
of
the
important
provisions
here,
and
a
second
one
of
the
important
provisions
here,
7117,
does.
but
here
it
very
explicitly
only
says
laws.
you
think
there
is
just
no
rhyme
nor
reason
to
its
just
using
laws
in
that
provision?
justice
scalia
in
the
absence
of
legislative
history
laws
means
the
same
thing
as
laws,
rules
or
regulations.
that's
the
way
you
want
to
interpret
the
statute?
justice
scalia
includes
some
regulations.
but
we're
not
bound
by
a
party's
view
of
the
thing.
justice
scalia
mr.
englehart,
could...
i
assume
that
the
position
the
authority
takes
with
regard
to
(2)(b)
it
also
has
to
take
with
respect...
with
respect
to
(2)(d)
of
section
7106(a).
and
that
is
to
say
you
would
also...
you
would
also
take
the
position,
i
assume,
that
if
the
agency
has
an
internal
memorandum
as
to
how
its
personnel
are
to
behave
in
emergency
situations,
and
it
says
this
is...
this
confers
no
private
rights
and
it
will
not
be
bargainable,
that
nonetheless
the
taking
of
actions
during...
to
carry
out
the
agency
mission
during
emergencies
would
be
bargainable?
justice
scalia
would
be
grievable.
justice
scalia
but
if
it
involved
conditions
of
employment,
even
emergency
actions
taken
by
agencies
would
be
subject
to
the
grievance
procedure.
justice
scalia
direct
effect--
justice
scalia
--whatever
you
want.
direct
effect
on
conditions
of
employment
would
be
grievable.
justice
scalia
well,
it's
the
easiest
part
of
the
case
to
see
that
it
is
hard.
[laughter]
is...
isn't
it
true
that
if
everything
you
say
is
right,
you
don't,
you
don't
need
anything
in
the
contract?
justice
scalia
--mr.
o'duden,
do
we...
do
we
owe
any
deference
to
anybody
here?
justice
scalia
to
who?
justice
scalia
the
flra--
justice
scalia
--have
we
said
that
in
any
of
our
cases?
justice
scalia
have
we
said
that
in
any
of
our
cases?
justice
scalia
well,
wait.
it's
effective...
it's
effective
with
respect
to
the
administrative
procedure
act,
presumably.
it
may
well
be
effective
to
exclude
judicial
review--
justice
scalia
--of
these
determinations.
justice
scalia
you
don't
want
to
give
that
away,
either?
justice
scalia
it's
at
least
conceivable
that
it
would
have
that
effect,
even
though
it
doesn't
have...
it
is
conceivable
that
it
could
have
that
effect
without
having
the
effect
of
preventing
grieving.
justice
scalia
precisely
how?
i...
that
is
what
i
really
don't
understand,
mr.
shapiro.
what
kind
of
rules
and
regulations
are
under
applicable
laws?
justice
scalia
is
that
the
same
question,
mr.
shapiro,
as
whether
you,
a
private
party,
could
bring
an
apa
suit
with
regard
to
them?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
i
would
like
to
have
some
body
of
law
that,
you
know,
that
the
lower
courts
are
looking
at.
just
to
say
well,
it
depends
on
whether
it's
an
applicable
law.
don't
we
have
any
body--
justice
scalia
--of
law
we
can
refer
to
on
these
questions?
