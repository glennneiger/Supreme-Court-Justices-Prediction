justice
white
under
what
provision?
justice
white
well,
what
would
be
your...
what
would
be
your
position
if
there
weren't
any
circular,
and
the
agency
went
ahead
and
contracted
out?
justice
white
and
then
any
proposals
to
bargain
over
any
aspect
of
contracting
out
wouldn't
be
negotiable?
justice
white
and
so
the...
so
you...
the
issuance
of
the
regulation
really
then
makes
bargainable
something
that
wouldn't
have
been
bargainable
before?
justice
white
i
mean
grievable,
yes.
justice
white
well,
and
then
hence
bargainable.
justice
white
yes,
but
the...
it
is
contended
by
the
government
that
this
circular
just
isn't
a
law,
rule
or
regulation,
never
was
intended
to
be.
justice
white
well,
however
you
put
it,
that's
its
characterization
of
its
own
circular.
justice
white
you
concede
that
omb
had
the
authority
to
issue
this
circular?
justice
white
and
is
the...
and
you
understand
the
government
to
concede
that
the
agencies
must,
must
follow
the
circular?
justice
white
you
must...
you
must
be
arguing
that
there
is
something
inconsistent
between
the
circular
and
the
law,
and
the
statutes
on
which
you
rely.
justice
white
well,
the
circular
says
there
is
only
one
way
to
review
these
actions
of
the
agency
under
the
circular.
justice
white
and
you
say
that
that
circular
cannot
be--
justice
white
--to
that
extent.
justice
white
but
that...
that
circular,
with
that
provision
in
it,
amounts
to
an
omb
construction
of
its
own
authority
and
of
the
statute's,
i
guess.
justice
white
what
is
at
issue
here
is
whether
or
not
the
agency
must
bargain
over
the
proposal
you
submitted.
justice
white
it
isn't
a
question
of
a
grievance.
justice
white
well,
it
isn't...
there
is
nothing...
you,
you
want
to
bargain
so
that
you
will
have
included
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
the
procedure
for
contracting
out.
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
what
is
the
provision
you
rely
on,
then,
to
say
that
this
issue
is
bargainable,
is
negotiable,
that
this
proposal
must
be,
must
be
acceded
to
by
the
agency?
is
it--
justice
white
--so
you
don't
rely
on...
you
don't
rely
at
all
on
7106(2)...
(b)(2)?
justice
white
well,
you
don't
really
need
the
contracted,
the
contractual
provision
at
all.
i
mean,
i...
the
hardest
part
of
this
case,
i
think,
is
why...
why
you
need
this
in
the
contract.
if
you
are
right
about
everything
you
say,
you
don't
even
need
a
contractual
provision.
isn't
that
right?
justice
white
it
seems
to
me
if
you
are
right
that
all
you
have
to...
the
management
is
subject
to
bargaining
to
establish
a
grievance
procedure
about
any
exercise
of
its
management
rights.
justice
white
so
you
have
to
rely...
to
win,
you
have
to
rely
on
the
circular?
justice
white
you
weren't
going
through
some
useless
procedure,
were
you,
in
submitting
this
proposal?
justice
scalia
said
well,
why
did
you
even
have...
ask...
why
did
you
even
submit
this
proposal
if
you
could
grieve
over...
over
this?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
why
do
you...
you
don't,
i
don't
suppose
the
authority
goes
around
deciding
issues
that
are
wholly
unnecessary
to
decide.
justice
white
well,
why
would
you...
why
do
you
think
the
union
presented
this
proposal?
justice
white
just
for
fun
or
do
you
think
they
thought
that
they
had
to
have
it
or
they
couldn't
grieve?
justice
white
make
sort
of
make-work--
justice
white
what's
your
answer
to
my
question?
justice
white
oh,
you
need
it?
you
need
it.
without
the
proposal
you
couldn't
grieve
over
this--
justice
white
so
the--
justice
white
--so
the
circular,
in
effect,
does
make
grievable,
you
say,
things
that
might
not
be
grievable
in
the
absence
of
the
circular?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
without
the
circular,
then
what
would
be
grievable?
justice
white
it's
kind
of
odd
that
it's
just
a
mistake
by
omb
then
to
think
that
it
had
the
authority
to
exclude
the
grievance
procedure
under
its
regulation.
that
is
just
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
you
are
saying?
justice
white
so...
so
its
provision
that...
its
provision
purporting
to
establish
an
exclusive
appeals
procedure
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
justice
white
xxx
if
you
just
repeal
the
circular,
just
withdrew
the
circular.
justice
white
well,
is
there
some...
as
long
as
it...
it's
a
directive
they
have
to
follow,
but
you
say
it's...
really
shouldn't
be
considered
a
rule
or
regulation.
justice
white
what
happens
if
the
agency
says
well,
i
heard
this
argument
up
in
court
and
i
know
this
isn't
a...
law
or
regulation,
so
i
just
won't
obey
it.
justice
white
what
does
that
president
have
to
do?
or
what
can
he
do?
anything?
justice
white
you
mean
like
the
member
of
an
agent...
independent
agency?
justice
white
it
doesn't...
it
doesn't
apply
to
independent
agencies?
justice
white
well,
the
agency
itself,
as
i
understand
under
75...
7106,
could
elect
to
bargain
over
some
of
its
management
rights.
justice
white
well,
section
(b),
7106(b)
says
at
the
election
of
the
agency
some
of
the
management
rights
could
be--
justice
white
--well,--
justice
white
--well,
it
says
nothing
in
this
section
shall
preclude
any
agency
and
any
labor
organization
from
negotiating
about
procedures
which
management
officials
will
observe
in
exercising
any
authority
under
this
section.
so
they
may
bargain
about
it
if
they
want
to.
isn't
that
right?
