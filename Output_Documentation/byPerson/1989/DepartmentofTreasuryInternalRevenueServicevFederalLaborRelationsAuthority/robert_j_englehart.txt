mr.
robert
j.
englehart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
congress
enacted
the
federal
service
labor
management
relations
statute,
it
required
that
every
collective
bargaining
agreement
have
a
grievance
procedure
ending
in
binding
arbitration.
congress
also
specified
the
kinds
of
disputes
that
can
be
brought
under
that
grievance
procedure.
a
dispute
over
whether
irs
violated
omb
circular
a-76
when
irs
contracts
out
the
jobs
of
bargaining
unit
employees
comes
within
that
authorized
scope
that
congress
specified
for
a
negotiated
grievance
procedure.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
under
the
provision
of
7103(a)(9)(c)(ii),
the
definition
of
grievance,
any
claimed
violation,
misinterpretation
or
misapplication
of
law,
rule
or
regulation.
at
the
outset,
it
is
important
to
emphasize
what
this
holding
by
the
federal
labor
relations
authority
does
not
do.
it
does
not
authorize
the
statute's
grievance
procedure
to
prevail
over
the
statute's
managements
right
provision.
management
has
no
right
to
make
determinations
that
violation
law,
rule
or
regulation
affecting
conditions
of
employment--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--then
there
would
be
no
binding
limits
on
management's
discretion,
and
that's
an
important
feature
of
the
authority's
position
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
proposals
that
could
quality
for
the
special
bargaining
status
under
7106(b)(2)
and
(b)(3),
yes.
but
the
discretion
generally
that
the
management
rights
provision
preserves
to
management
is
non-bargainable,
and
this
proposal
doesn't
seek
to
bargain
over
that
discretion.
it
seeks
to
hold--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--it
makes
grievable
something
that
wouldn't
other--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--grievable;
and
this
provision--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--to
the
extent
of
stipulating
the
scope
of
the
grievance
procedure,
yes.
but
not
the
substantive
exercise
or
in
any
way
narrowing
the
scope
of
the
exercise.
it
doesn't
change
that
at
all.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
yes,
the
authority
does
not
see
a
conflict
between
the
command
of
section
7106
and
the
grievance
procedure.
7106
begins
"nothing
in
this
chapter".
the
next
words
are
"shall
affect
the
authority".
the
authority's
position
is
that
the
management
authority,
protected
from
other
aspects
of
the
chapter,
is
the
authority
to
make
determinations
in
accordance
with
law,
rule
and
regulation
affecting
conditions
of
employment.
that
it
does
not
give
extra
protection
or
different
protection...
separate
protection
for
illegal
exercise
of
management
rights.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
justice
scalia,
we
read
applicable
laws
in
7106
as
we
would
section...
subsection
(b)(2)
and
(b)(3).
those
are
exceptions
when
you
have
a
conflict.
we
do
not
read
a
conflict
between
the
authority
reserved
to
management
in
section
7106
and
the
right
to
grieve
when
there
has
been
an
alleged
violation
of
law,
rule
or
regulation.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
well,
we
note
that
irs
does
not
contend
that
laws
is
limited
to
congressional
enactments,
that
it
includes
laws,
rules
and
regulations.
irs,
until
its
reply
brief,
did
not
contend
that
there
was
any
difference
between
the
laws,
rules
and
regulations
encompassed
within
that
phrase
from
the
law,
rule
and
regulation
referred
to
in
the
definition
of
grievance.
only
now,
in
the
reply
brief,
do
we
see
the
suggestion
that
the
applicable
laws
reference
would
be
more
narrow.
we're
not
told
why
the
circular
cannot
qualify
as
a
rule
or
regulation
for
applicable
law
purposes,
if
it
can
qualify
for
rule
or
regulation
for
the
definition
of
grievance.
and
in
the
absence
of
legislative
history
either
defining
applicable
laws
or
determining
how
it
should
be
construed,
there
seems
to
be
no
basis
to
compel
a
construction
of
applicable
laws
that
is
more
narrow.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
irs
does
not
dispute
the
fact
that
applicable
laws
includes
laws,
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
i
understand,
your
honor.
but
the
fundamental
difference
why
the
authority
does
not
find
applicable
law
as
a
question
that
is
controlling
in
the
case,
is
because
the
authority
does
not
see
a
reason
to
have
an
escape
clause
from
section
7106,
if
you
will.
there
is
no
conflict
when
grievance
determinations
are
only
allowed
to
affect
management
action
that
violates
law,
rule
or
regulation
affecting
conditions
of
employment.
a
critical
point
in
the
case
is
that
management
does
not
contend
it
has
the
authority
to
arrive
at
determinations
that
violate
law,
rule
or
regulation
affecting
conditions
of
employment.
irs
does
not
contend
that
it
has
this
authority.
therefore,
determinations,
and
the
authority
reviews
these
determinations
for
compliance
with
law,
rule
and
regulation...
that
is
part
of
the
authority's
job...
determinations
which
are
limited
to
stopping
that
exercise
of
management
right
don't
affect
the
authority.
i
would
emphasize
for
this
court
that
in
no
other
case,
dealing
with
no
other
management
right,
has
a
court
ever
been
urged
to
find
that
grievances
are
prohibited
over
the
exercise
of
a
management
right,
other
than
in
the
area
of
contracting
out.
we
have
this
argument
in
this
case
that...
by
irs...
that
asks
that
we
find
that
congress
put
two
provisions
of
the
statute
in
collision.
they
need
not
be
in
collision.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
the
government,
as
i
understand
their
position
in
the
reply,
is
that
there
is
an
interest
in
having
it
not
be
an
applicable
law,
even
if
it
is
a
law,
rule
or
regulation
affecting
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
the
omb
is
the
issuing
agency,
and
the
omb,
we
submitted
in
our
brief
on
pages
34
to
45,
an
examination
will
reveal
that
omb
does
consider
the
circular
a
regulation--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--yes,
we
do.
and
we
also
argue
that--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--i
don't
know
that
there
is
a
dispute
over
that.
i
believe
the
dispute
is
over
where
they
can
be
held
accountable,
and
that
is
really
the
fundamental
difference
in
the
case.
the
comptroller
general
is
involved
in
reviewing
these
cases
for
compliance
with
the
circular.
but
the
irs
would
argue
the
comptroller
general
is
not
hampered
by--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
right.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
it
is
our
position--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--it
is
our
position
that
that
aspect
of
the
circular
can't
override
congress'
command
in
the
statute.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
we
would
argue
that,
for
purposes
of
whether
it
is
a
law,
rule
or
regulation
under
our
statute,
one
looks
at
the
overall
effect
of
the
regulation.
that
certainly
is
to
be
taken
into
account,
but
it
shouldn't
be
controlling--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--well,
the
grievance
procedure
is
not
an
aspect
that
management
uses
in
exercising
its
determination
to
contract
out.
the
grievance
procedure
is
something
under
the
circular
that
has
afforded
directly
affected
parties
to
challenge
compliance
with
what
the
circular
would
appear
to
concede
are
mandatory
and
non-discretionary
aspects.
all
that
the
statute
does
is
latch
onto
binding
rules
and
regulations
in
the
federal
government,
regulations,
provided
that
they
affect
conditions
of
employment.
and
that
is
a
very
narrowing
term.
this
grievance
procedure
is
not
about
to
latch
onto
rules
and
regulations
and
laws
that
have
no
relationship
to
the
conditions
of
employment.
and
we
don't
see
that
irs
is
contesting
that
aspect
of
the
case.
this
would
appear
to
be
a
law,
rule
or
regulation
affecting
conditions
of
employment.
i
would
like
to
emphasize
one
important
point
that
is
being
raised
by
irs,
latter
in
the
case,
is
a
suspicion
about
the
intent
behind
the
grievance
procedure,
that
because
it
is
in
a
definitional
provision
of
the
statute
it
perhaps
is
an
inadvertent
or
unintended
reference.
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
shows
the
congress
was
very
well
aware
that
it
was
defining
the
scope
of
the
grievance
procedure
by
use
of
this
definitional
provision.
the
house
committee
report
references
the
fact
that
the
definition
of
grievance
is
broad,
but
that
section
7121(c)
of
the
statute
is
a
limiting
term
on
the
scope
of
the
grievance
procedure.
and,
if
you'll
notice
in
section
7121(c),
a
small
portion
of
management
rights
do
appear
there,
so
that
management
didn't
think
that
just
by
making
something
a
management...
i
am
sorry,
so
that
congress
didn't
think
that
just
by
making
something
a
management
right
it
also
made
it
non-grievable.
the
conference
committee
report
also
stated
that
unless
the
parties
agree
otherwise,
and
obviously
irs
is
perfectly
well
equipped
to
do
so,
to
bargain
at
the
table
for
a
narrower
scope,
the
intended
scope
of
the
grievance
procedure
was
a
broad
one.
the
suggestion
that
the
grievance
definition
is
not
to
be
trusted,
i
believe
underlies
a
basic
unfamiliarity
that
irs
has
with
this
statute.
the
other
cornerstone
is
the
collective
bargaining
obligation.
in
section
7114
of
the
statute
just
says
under
our
law
have
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
one
has
to
go
to
three
separate
definitional
provisions,
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
then
collective
bargaining
and
then
conditions
of
employment,
before
the
contours
of
that
bargaining
obligation
even
begin
to
surface.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
your
honor--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--each
case
would
turn
upon
analysis
of
whether
the
regulation
involved
was
one
that
affected
conditions
of
employment.
and
i
think
you
could
anticipate
by
your
question
regulations
that
may
well
be
valid
rules
and
regulations
and
indeed
laws
that
wouldn't
by
their
nature
and
effect
primarily
be
directed
at
conditions
of
employment.
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
involved,
your
honor,
i
submit
based
upon
authority
analysis,
wouldn't
be
enough.
it
would
be
a
direct
and...
direct
effect
on
the
conditions
of
employment--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--and
intended--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--and
an
intent
to
affect
conditions
of
employment,
that
is
an
aspect
of
why
the
regulation
was
initiated.
that
would
be,
obviously,
the
test.
in
the
example
that
you
gave,
i
think
that
there
would
also
be
competing
considerations,
the
kind
of
considerations
that
you
see
in
authority
case
law
in
the
contracting
out
area,
that
would
be...
that
would
recognize
that
the
scope
of
review
that
arbitrators
are
allowed
to
entertain,
and
the
remedies
that
arbitrators
are
allowed
to
fashion
are
very
limited,
given
the
nature
of
the
right.
in
this
case
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
we
no
longer
have
any
legitimate
complaint
from
irs
over
what
the
grievance
procedure
does
in
these
cases.
we've
enumerated
the
authority's
decision.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
well,
the
proposal--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--your
honor,
the
proposal
merely
specifies
the
scope
of
the
grievance
procedure
with
respect
to
the
contracting-out
determination.
it
does
not
in
any
other
way
change
management's
discretion
in
the
area,
in
the
traditional
way--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--not
must
be
acceded
but
must
be
on
the
bargaining
table.
it
is
the
rights
that
flow
from
section
7121
of
the
statute
that
command
that
every
collective
bargaining
agreement
have
a
grievance
procedure.
and
grievance
procedure
is
defined
in
7103(a)(9)--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--your
honor,
we
believe
that
congress
intended
the
grievance
procedure
to
exist
even
if
there
weren't
a
(b)(2).
this
may
well
be
analyzed
as
a
(b)(2)
procedure.
but
if
there
were
no
(b)(2)
in
the
statute,
congress
made
its
intent
clear
with
respect
to
the
ability
to
grieve
alleged
violations
of
law,
rule
and
regulation
affecting
conditions
of
employment.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
that
shouldn't
be
the
hardest
part
of
this
case,
though,
i
submit,
in
that
it--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--if
the
grievance
procedure
were
undefined
except
to
entertain
the
statutory
command
of
law,
rule
and
regulation
violations
affecting
conditions
of
employment,
the
authority's
position
is
that
would
bring
this
within
the
scope.
that
is
correct.
and
that
this
makes
specific
so
as
to
obviate
delay
and
confusion
at
some
point
on
when
there
is
an
actual--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--not
about
any
exercise
of
its
management
rights.
the
grievance
procedure
does
not
exempt
management's
rights
from
scrutiny
for
the
limited
purpose
of
compliance
with
law,
rule
and
regulation.
that
is
so
important
to
this
case.
the
authority
has
made
clear
that
any
determination
by
management
that
is
within
the
bounds
of
law--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--to
win
we
rely
on
two
points.
the
scope
of
the
grievance
procedure
is
commanded
by
the
language
and
the
specific
intent
of
congress,
and
that
the
circular
is
a
law,
rule
and
regulation
affecting
conditions
of
employment.
just
those
two
points.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
i
don't
believe
we
do,
your
honor,
because
we
don't
attach
the
significance
to
that
phrase
as
defining
the
scope
of
the
grievance
procedure.
we
believe
the
grievance
procedure
defines
that
scope.
let
me
give
you
this
hypothetical.
if
applicable
laws
were
used
to
define
grievances
that
would
suggest
that
you
could
never
grieve
the
exercise
of
a
management
right
that
appears
in
(a)(1),
there
are
a
number
of
rights
there,
or
that
appear
in
(b)(1).
or
that
you
couldn't
have
a
provision
in
your
contract
that
required
compliance
with
any
kind
of
law
for
an
(a)(1)
right
or
a
(b)(1)
right.
the
authority
case
law
is
to
the
contrary,
and
we
would
note
that
judge,
now
justice,
kennedy's
decision
in
u.s.
marshall
service,
decided...
cited
at
page
29
of
our
brief,
suggests
just
the
assertion
of
a
7106(b)
right
does
not
preclude
a
grievance.
grievance
is
a
specific
intent
and
specifically
defined
by
congress.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
only...
it
is
directly
about
grievance.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
bargain
about
a
provision
that
stipulates
the
scope
of
the
grievance
procedure.
so
it
is
involving--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--the
federal
labor
relations
authority
didn't
submit
a
proposal.
a
union
submitted
a
proposal,
in
this
case
national
treasury
employees
union,
which
an
employer
declared
non-negotiable,
and
it
came
to
the
authority
in
its
capacity
to
adjudicate
negotiability
issues.
and
the
authority
issued
an
order
that
has
since
been
appealed.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
the
authority
is
required
to
decide
any
negotiability
dispute
that
is
properly
presented
to
it.
and
in
this
case
irs
declared
this
proposal
non-negotiable.
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
my
understanding--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
union
thought
they
had
to
have
it.
i
think
the
union
wanted
to
get
this
kind
of
litigation
out
of
the
way
so
that
when
a
contracting-out
determination
came
down
the
pipe--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--they
would
be
ready.
well,
the
make-work
has
come
because
it
is
challenged
by
irs,
not
because
the
union
submitted
it.
indeed,
the--
mr.
robert
j.
englehart
--thank
you.
