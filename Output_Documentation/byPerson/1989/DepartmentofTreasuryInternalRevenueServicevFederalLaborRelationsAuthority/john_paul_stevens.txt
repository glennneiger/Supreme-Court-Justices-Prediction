justice
stevens
may
i
ask...
yes,
may
i
just
ask
one
question,
mr.
shapiro?
we
have
been
talking
all
about
7106(a)(2)(b),
and
what
if
we
talked
about
7106(a)(2)(a),
to
hire,
assign,
direct,
lay
off
and
so
forth...
that
provision.
and
supposing
instead
of
70...
circular
7...
circular
76
we
had
a
circular
general
personnel
policies
about
hiring
and
the
like.
would
your
same
argument
apply
that
that
would
also
not
be
an
applicable
law?
justice
stevens
and
the
circular
that
is
in
effect,
what
about
the
one--
justice
stevens
--is
that
an
applicable
law?
that
is
my
question.
