justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
shapiro,
i
guess
you
come
close
to
conceding
that
the
circular
is
a
governmentwide
rule
or
regulation
for
purpose
of
section
7117.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
strikes
one
as
a
little
odd
that
congress
intended
a
different
meaning
for
purposes
of
7103
than
it
did
in
7117.
justice
o'connor
may
i
ask
a
question
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
shapiro?
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
the
management
rights
provision
was
not
intended
to
limit
the
sphere
of
what
is
grievable
under
the
grievance
provisions?
justice
o'connor
does
the
legislative
history
give
us
any
indications
about
that?
