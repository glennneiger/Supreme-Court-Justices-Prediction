mr.
kim
t.
buckley
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
of
interpreting
the
citizen
suit
provisions
of
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act.
these
citizen
suit
provisions
are
virtually
identical
in
many
other
citizen
suit
provisions
in
other
federal
environmental
laws.
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
dismissal
and
refiling
is
required
if
there
has
been
a
failure
to
notify
the
government
of
the
violation.
in
this
particular
case,
through
inadvertence
on
my
part,
i
notified
tillamook
county
that
it
was
in
violation
of
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
in
the
operation
of
its
landfill
operation.
at
the
time
that
i
notified
tillamook
county,
i
intended
also
to
notify
the
government.
the
statute
requires
that
the
epa
and
the
oregon
department
of
environmental
quality
also
be
notified
of
the
violation.
and
i
was
aware
of
that
statute
and
aware
of
the
regulation,
but
somewhere
between
the
execution...
the
intention
and
the
execution
something
went
wrong.
nevertheless,
a
year
later,
the
citizen
suit
was
filed
and
approximately,
say
nine
months
later,
tillamook
county
moved
for
summary
judgment,
asking
the
court
to
dismiss
the
case
on
the
ground
that
there
was
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
because
notice
to
the
government
had
not
been
given.
immediately
after
having
received
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
i
sent
notice
to
the
epa
and
deq,
upon
learning,
to
my
surprise,
that
i
had
not
done
so;
in
fact,
i
thought
i
had
done
so
and
was
very
surprised
to
learn
that
i
hadn't.
the
case
came
on
for
hearing
approximately
50
days
after
the
motion
was
filed,
and
about
50
days
after
i
sent
a
notice
to
the
epa
and
the
oregon
department
of
environmental
quality.
and,
at
that
time,
the
district
court
said
that
he
thought
it
would
be
a
waste
of
judicial
resources,
given
the
fact
that
the
epa
and
the
oregon
department
of
environmental
quality
had
not
indicated
either
any
objection
or
that
they
intended
to
do
anything.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
yes,
yes.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
motion
for
summary
judgment--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--yes.
and
that
hearing
took
place
approximately
50
days
after
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
filed
and
after
i
gave
the
formal
notice
required
by
the
statute,
and
the
judge
said
that
it
would
be
a
waste
of
judicial
resources
to
require
dismissal
at
this
time.
about
two
years
later,
and
about
two
years
after--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--yes,
that
was
the
whole
ground
of
the
motion.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
after
the
district
judge
essentially
said
to
me
that
i
had
done
everything
that
was
required
because
the
defect
had
been
cured,
the
case
went
to
trial
about
two
years
later
and
an
injunction
was
entered
against
tillamook
county.
a
finding
was
made
that
it
was
in
violation
of
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
standards.
so
we
are
here
today
under
this,
what
i
consider
to
be
a
fairly
unusual
factual
situation,
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
dismissal
and
refiling
would
be
necessary.
the
way
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
dismissal
and
refiling
would
be
necessary
is
to
take
a
look
at
the
statute
itself
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
statute
makes
giving
the
notice
a
jurisdictional
requirement
that
would
require
dismissal
and
refiling.
now,
of
course,
the
first
place...
this
obviously
presents
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
and
the
starting
point,
obviously,
is
the
text
of
the
statute.
the
text
of
the
statute
has
one
sentence
that
refers
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
and
that
one
sentence
says
that
the
district
court
shall
have
jurisdiction
to
enforce
an
order
brought
in
a
citizen
suit,
enforce
compliance.
that
is
the
one
sentence
that
talks
about
the
district
court's
jurisdiction.
the
rest
of
the
statute,
the
rest
of
the
provision,
refers
to
timing
requirements
of
the
notice
and
timing;
it
refers
to
how
and
who
may
intervene;
it
refers
to
attorney
fees.
and,
in
the
most
recent
amendments
to
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act,
there
is
also
an
additional
requirement
that
if
the
citizen
is
going
to
bring
an
action
for
immediate
endangerment
to
the
health
or
the
environment,
that
he
must
serve
a
copy
of
the
complaint
on
the
attorney
general
and
the
administrator
of
the
epa.
so
the
question
that
we
have
here
is,
are
these
additional
requirements
jurisdictional
requirements--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--well,
i
think
it
is,
your
honor,
because
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
that
it
was
a
jurisdictional
requirement.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
well,
i
hope
that
the
court
does
not
follow
the
ninth
circuit.
[laughter]
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
well,
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
it
is
a
requirement.
i
mean,
congress
indicated
that
giving
notice
to
the
government
and
to
the
violator
was
a
requirement,
and
i
agree
that
it
is
a
requirement.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
i
guess
that's
the
point.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
best
way
to
effectuate
the
intent
of
congress
to
accomplish
the
purpose
that
congress
intended
is
to
grant
or
recognize
that
the
district
courts
have
limited
jurisdiction
to
fashion
an
order
that
will
somehow
serve
both
the
overlying
purpose
of
the
statute,
which
is
to
protect
the
environment;
the
secondary
purpose
of
the
statute,
which
is
to
encourage
citizen
enforcement;
and
the
third
purpose,
which,
of
course,
is
to
try
to
trigger
government
action
and
to
also
trigger
voluntary
compliance.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
yes,
the
language
is
very--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--well,
yes,
it
is.
but
this
court,
in
a
number
of
other
cases
where
private
attorney
generals
have
been
entrusted
by
congress
with
the
right
to
bring
an
action
to
enforce
policies
that
congress
deems
important,
has
held
that
similarly
explicit
requirements
are
not
a
basis
for
requiring
dismissal
and
refiling.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
right,
and
the
legislative
history
in
this
case
dealt
primarily
with
a
situation,
this
particular
situation,
that
there
are
going
to
be
lots
and
lots
and
lots
of
violations
of
environmental
law
out
there,
and
it
can't
be
expected
that
the
government
is
going
to
be
able
to
monitor
every
single
violation
out
there.
and
it
was
thought
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
enlist
the
aid
and
the
eyes
and
the
ears
of
the
citizens
to
uncover
those
violations.
and
so
it
was
thought
that
if
there
is
an
unknown
violation
out
there
that
the
government
doesn't
know
about,
then
it's
a
good
idea
to
allow
the
citizens
to
bring
that
to
the
attention
of
the
government
so
the
government
can
make
its
own
investigation
or
prioritize.
i
mean,
it
has
to
prioritize
because
it
doesn't
have
the...
pardon
me...
it
doesn't
have
the
resources
to
go
after
every
single
violation.
and,
of
course,
it
was
thought
then
that
if
the
government
did
not
act,
that
the
citizen
could
then
bring
a
suit.
well,
in
this
particular
case,
and
the
reason
that
i
focus
on
the
facts
of
this
case
is
because
there
are
going
to
be
unique
facts
presented
all
the
time,
and
the
reason,
since
there
are
going
to
be
unique
facts
presented
all
the
time,
it's
a
good
idea
to
let
the
district
courts
have
the
flexibility
to
meet
real
life
situations.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
well,
that
is
true.
you
know,
a
bright
line
rule
always
has
the
advantage
of
giving
clarity
and
a
bright
line
rule,
but
that's
also--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--yes.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
you
mean
how
do
i
know
if
the
government
has
brought
a
suit
or
not?
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
well,
i
suppose
that
you
could
do
that.
usually,
i
suppose--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--um
hum.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
well,
i
think
that
is
the
apparent
way
to
interpret
it,
your
honor.
i
do.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
yes,
it
does.
i
agree.
i
don't
think...
i
think
there's
room
for
disagreement
given
the
legislative
history,
but
i
think
that
that
is
the
best
interpretation.
but
also
in
the
legislative
history
there
was--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--well,
if
i
may
answer,
yes,
that
is
true
if
you
look
only
at
that
particular
section
and
don't
try
to
interpret
that
section
in
the
context
of
the
statute
as
a
whole,
and
if
you
don't
instead
also
look
to
the
purpose
that
that
provision
was
intended
to
serve.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
yes.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
yes,
i
am
making
that
argument.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
i
think
that
would
effectuate
the
will
of
congress
in
this
particular
case,
when--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--i
think
it
would
be
at
the
cost
of
injustice
in
many
cases,
and
i
think
it
would
also
be
at
the
cost
of
defeating
the
will
of
congress
on
the
statute
as
a
whole.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
well,
first
of
all,
if
there
are
other
lawyers
like
me
out
there,
who
realize
that
that
is
a
requirement,
and
yet,
as
i
said
between
the
intention
and
the
execution
something
falls
through
the
cracks,
and,
at
the
same
time
the
government
in
fact
has,
the
government
with
enforcement
authority
has
actual
authority,
has
actual
notice,
and
decides
to
do
nothing,
then
to
have
the
court
impose
a
bright
line
rule
would
have
the
result,
in
this
case,
of
requiring
a
dismissal
and
refiling
to
serve
no
congressional
purpose.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
well,
i
am
arguing
judicial
estoppel.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
well,
i'm
arguing
that
the
court
should
interpret
the
requirement
of
notice
to
be
a
procedural
requirement,
one
that
the
district
court
can
have
flexibility
to
meet
real
life
situations.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
well,
no,
i
disagree,
your
honor.
not
to
rewrite
the
statute.
to
enforce
the
intent
of
the
statute.
i
mean,
this
court
has
held--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--well,
in
other
situations
in
the
civil
rights
context,
this
court
has
held
that
similar
prelitigation
requirements
specified
by
congress
in
similar
mandatory
language
are,
in
fact,
requirements
where
the
court
can
fashion
a
remedy.
in
fact,
in
the
oscar
mayer
case,
this
court
said
that
dismissal
and
refiling
is
not
good,
that
a
stay
would
be
far
more
appropriate
to
allow
the
litigant
in
that
case
time
to
provide
the
notice
to
the
state.
and
the
same
thing
was
held
in
the
baldwin
case;
however
in
the
baldwin
case,
the
court
held
that
the
plaintiff
in
that
case
had
not
satisfied
the
requirement
because
she
had
been
told
three
times
what
she
had
to
do.
and
that's
not
what
happened
in
this
case.
and
in
baldwin,
this
court
specifically
said
that
this,
that
baldwin
wasn't
a
case
where
the
district
court
had
led
the
plaintiff
in
that
case--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--i
think
that
the
rhyme
or
reason
is
that
the
court
generally
tries
to
construe
remedial
statutes,
and
particularly
statutes
that
are
enforced
by
private
attorney
generals,
to
effectuate
the
remedial
purpose
of
the
statute.
and
to
require
dismissal
and
refiling
in
this
case
would
be,
would
serve
no
purpose.
i
mean
after
all,
the
department
of
environmental
quality
knew
about
the
violation
before
the
case
was
filed,
before
the
notice
was
given,
and
didn't
do
anything.
it
knew
about
the
filing
of
the
case
even
before
the
formal
notice
was
given
and
didn't
do
anything.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
but
there
probably
are
not
many
other
exceptions.
i
mean,
one
of
the
advantages
of
giving
flexibility
to
the
district
court,
is
to
rule
in
the
exceptional
case,
as
this
one
is,
that...
that
to
require
dismissal
and
refiling
when
there
is
only
nine
days
left
in
the
period
would
be
a
waste
of
judicial
resources.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
well,
i
think
that...
that's
what
this
court
should
hold,
and
i
think
that's
what
this
court
has
held
repeatedly.
that
when
the
words
of
the
statute
compel
a
result
that
is
plainly
at
variance
with
the
policy
of
the
statute,
that
you
have
to
go
along
and
look
behind
the
statute
to
try
to
interpret
the
statute
to
achieve
the
purpose.
i
mean,
the
language
here
says
it's
mandatory,
but
at
the
same
time...
look
at
the
save
our
sounds
versus
callaway
case.
i
mean,
that's
a
wonderful
example
of
the
district
court
having
struggled
with
the
idea,
that
thinking
that
it
was
a
jurisdictional
requirement
that
required
dismissal
and
refiling,
and
yet
came
up
with
a
theory
that
there
had
been
some
kind
of
substantial
compliance,
when,
in
fact,
there
really
hadn't
been.
that
case
involved
a
dredging
question,
the
army
corps
of
engineers
had
known
that
there
was
a
citizen
group
that
was
concerned
about--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--it
was
in
the
district
of
rhode
island,
and
it
is
save
our
sounds
versus
callaway.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
it's
a
district
court
case,
and
the
point
of
that
is
not
that
it
has
precedential
value,
but
that
it
presented
a
unique
factual
situation,
as
this
case
does,
where
it
made
sense
for
the
district
court
to
have
discretion.
in
that
particular
case,
the
army
corps
of
engineers
knew
that
the
citizens
were
concerned
about
the
dumping
of
polluted,
dredged
material
on
a
beach
somewhere,
and
knew
that
it
was
also,
under
statutory
requirements,
under
the
national
environmental
protection
act,
the
marine
protection
act,
and
the
water
pollution
act,
that
it
had
to
have
public
hearings
and
notices
and
certain
time
periods
had
to
be...
had
to
be
observed,
like
90
days
for
circulation
of
a
draft
environmental
impact
statement.
and
what
the
army
corps
of
engineers
was...
did
was
that
it
was
so
anxious
to
get
the
case
going,
that
it
shortcut
those.
it
violated
those
statutes
and
let
the
contract
out
before
the
90-day
period
had
run,
without
any
public
hearing
or
anything
like
that.
and
the
citizens
found
out
that
this
contract
was
going
to
be
let,
and
if
they
waited
for
the
entire
60
days,
that
dredged
material
would
have
been
dredged
and
deposited.
and
the
court
said
that
it
thought,
in
a
footnote,
that
it
was
a
jurisdictional
requirement,
but,
at
the
same
time,
it
said
that
it
thought
that
there
had
been
substantial
compliance
because
the
citizens
had
made
their
objections
known
to
the
army
corps
of
engineers
several
months
before.
but,
in
that
case,
there
had
been
no
notice
sent
to
the
environmental
protection
agency
and
there
hadn't
been
any
notice
sent
to
the
state
department
of
environmental
quality.
so
there
had
been
no
compliance
with
the
letter
of
the
statute.
you
know,
long
ago
in
the
1800s,
this
court
decided
the
holy
trinity
case,
and
went
and
said
and
provided
the
principle,
that
this
court
said
that
it
can
look
through
the
letter
to
the
spirit
of
the
statute.
and
it
gave
several
examples.
i
mean,
one
example
was
that
there's
a
law
that
prevents
a
prisoner
from
trying
to
escape
prison.
apparently
there
was
a
case
where
there
was
a
fire
in
the
prison
and
the
prisoner
escaped,
and
somebody--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--well,
i
remember--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--i
do
think
that
was
a
correct
result
because
when
the
court
looked
at
the
legislative
history...
and
i
believe
that
was
a
unanimous
decision...
when
the
court
looked
at
the
legislative
history,
it
determined
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
prevent
the
wholesale
importation
of
unskilled
manual
labor.
and
that
the
court
determined
that
that...
that
there
was
even
some
discussion
just
before
the
statute
was
enacted,
that
the
senate
was
concerned
that
well,
you
know,
if
we
just
leave
this
broad
language
here--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke.
they
made
a,
i
think
they
made
a
brain
toil
exception
i
think
is
what
they
said.
we're
not
short
of
people
who
toil
by
their
brains.
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
only
reason
why
this
case
would
have
to
be
refiled,
dismissed
and
refiled,
when
it
would
serve
no
purpose,
is
if
it
is
interpreted
as
a
jurisdictional
requirement,
and
congress
has
had
no
problem
interpreting,
has
had
no
problem
saying
that,
when
a
requirement
is
jurisdictional.
i
mean,
for
example,
in
the
norris
laguardia
act
it
says
that
no
court
shall--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--well,
one
of
the
purposes
to
be
served
by
the
notice
requirement...
in
the
legislative
history,
one
of
the
purposes
to
be
served
by
the
notice
requirement
was
to
ease
the
burden
on
the
courts.
i
mean,
that
was
one
of
the
thoughts.
i,
last
week
i
looked
in
the,
a
report
of
the
administrator
of
the
district
courts
to
determine
exactly
what
kind
of
burden
citizen
suits
impose
on
the
courts.
and
in
fiscal
1987,
there
were
239,000
cases
filed,
270
of
which
were
private
environmental
cases.
these
do
not
present
a
huge
burden
on
the
court.
if
the
court
looks
through
west's
publication
of
usca,
the
citizen
suit
cases
are
very,
very
slight.
there
is
just
not
that
many
of
them
and
the
reason
is
because
it
is
a
very
expensive
business
to
get
in,
for
a
private
citizen
to
get
into
the
business
of
trying
to
enforce
federal
law.
and,
of
course,
the
preferred
procedure
would
be
to
have
the
government
do
it.
but
if
the
government
knows
about
the
action
and
does
not
act,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
it
serves
the
purpose
to
allow
the
citizens
to
proceed.
now,
i
think
that
also
one
of
the
other...
one
of
the
other
points
is
that
since
this
court
has
interpreted
similar
prelitigation
requirements,
requirements
for
gaining
access
to
federal
court
for
private
attorneys
general,
not
to
require
dismissal
and
refiling,
or
to
allow
the
court
to
have
discretion
to
fashion
some
kind
of
an
order
that
is
going
to
serve
the
purpose,
the
remedial
purpose
of
the
statute
as
a
whole,
as
well
as
the
particular
purpose
of
the
particular
requirement,
the
notice
requirement--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--yes,
i
do.
i
don't
think
that
is
true.
i
mean,
i
disagree
with
that
conclusion.
i
believe
that
was
one
that
was
advanced
by
judge
merritt
initially
in
a
dissenting
opinion
in
the
ada-cascade
case,
and
then
eventually
was
a
majority
opinion.
i
just
don't
think
that
is
true,
in
general.
positions
don't
become
hardened
when
litigation
is
filed,
not
particular,
not
in
this
kind
of
a
case.
i
know
that
my
clients'
position
became
hardened
as
soon
as
the
tillamook
county
began
operating
the
landfill
in
violation,
in
flagrant
violation
with
the
requirements.
the
positions--
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
--the
problem
is
not
now
corrected.
the
county
has
gone
a
long
way
toward
correcting
the
problem,
but
it
is
not
now
corrected.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
no,
i
don't
think
that
the
county
would
go
back
to
its
former
practices,
but
i
do
think
that
the
case
would
be
refiled...
i
don't
think
this
is
a
situation
of
mootness.
you
know,
i
mean,
one
of
the
things
that
happened
in
this
case
was
in
its
efforts,
in
their
efforts
to
try
to
get
an
injunction
against
the
county,
the
hallstroms
spent
$95,000
in
attorney
fees
and
expert
witness
fees.
and,
it
seems
to
me,
that
if
the
court
were
to
say
that
this
case
had
to
be
dismissed
and
refiled,
that
the
message
that
citizens
and
citizens
groups
would
be
hearing
throughout
the
country
is
that
this
court
is
going
to
interpret
strictly
provisions
that
are
against
the
citizens.
i
mean,
it
is
not,
i
guess...
i
hate
to
say
this,
but
it
is
just
not
fair
to
say
to
the
citizens,
sure,
it
is
fine
for
you
to
spend
$95,000
and
get
an
injunction,
but
we're
still
going
to
require
you,
as
this
court
said
in
the
newman-green
case,
to
jump
through
a
judicial
hoop
that
would
really
serve
no
purpose.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
well,
whenever
the
court
looks
and
focuses
on
one
specific
sentence
in
an
entire
statute
and
says
that
that
is
not
ambiguous,
i
think
the
court
disregards
the
whole
context
of
the
statute.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
but
it
also...
but
the
whole
statute
also
does
as
well,
your
honor.
i
mean,
the
whole
statute
was
enacted
to
protect
the
environment,
to
encourage
citizen
enforcement,
and
also
to
trigger
governmental
action
and
to
trigger
action
by
the
violator
to
come
into
complete
compliance.
i
mean,
that
is
the
context
that
we
find
that
sentence
in.
and
the
context
is
also
when
the
court
takes
a
look
at
the
legislative
history.
and
the
context
is
also
including
this
court's
other
decisions
in
other
private
attorney
general
cases
as
well.
and
i
think
that
it
makes
sense
for
similar
prelitigation
requirements
in
a
similar
context
in
analogous
situations
to
be
interpreted
consistently.
and
in
the
baldwin
case,
this
court
said
that
if
the
district
court
has
led
the
plaintiff
to
believe
that
she
had
done
everything
required
of
her,
that
it
would
be
inequitable
to
then
say
that
she
hadn't.
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
district
court
said
that
the
requirement
had
been
cured
and
that
we
had
done
everything
required
of
us
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
and
this
case
has
gone
far
beyond
just
a
motion
to
dismiss,
as
in
many
of
the
cases.
this
case
went
to
trial.
an
injunction
was
entered,
the
environment
was
protected,
the
government
was
notified
and
the
government
decided
not
to
do
anything,
either
because
of
resources
or
because
of
some
other
reason,
i
don't
know.
mr.
kim
t.
buckley
it
will
be
refiled.
there
is
one
that
has
been
refiled
already,
because
i
gave
another
notice
as
well
for
the
violation
that
is
ongoing
now.
it's
stayed
pending
the
decision
in
this
court.
thank
you.
