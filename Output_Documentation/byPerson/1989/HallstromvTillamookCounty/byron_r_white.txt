justice

if
you
lose,
do
you
think
the
case
will
be
refiled?
justice
white
--say
that.
justice
white
well,
it
doesn't
say
that
in
those
words.
justice
white
well,
do
you
think
you
have
to
look
at
something
besides
the
words
that
no
case
may
be
commenced
without
a
notice?
do
you
have
to
look
beyond
those
words?
justice
white
because
that
just,
everybody
agrees
that
you
are
supposed
to
give
a
notice
before
there
is
a
commencement.
but
the
question
is,
if
you
fail
to
do
that,
what's
the
remedy.
justice
white
well,
let's
start
with
that.
it
does
mean
what
it
says.
justice
white
well,
now
tell
me
why
those
words
unequivocally
say
that
if
you
fail
to
give
notice
that,
something
that
is
filed
without
the
notice
must
be
dismissed,
rather
than
just
stayed.
why
isn't
a
stay
with
notice
given
then
an
adequate
remedy
for
this
failure?
if
there
hadn't
been
the
failure
you
certainly
wouldn't
stay
a
case,
but
the
judge
says
i
think
it's
a
perfectly
adequate
remedy
for
this
failure,
for
this
unfortunate
failure,
to
stay
the
case.
why
isn't
that
an
adequate
remedy
for
it?
justice
white
well,
tell
me
what
clear
words
require
dismissal?
justice
white
do
you
think
the,
whoever
was
entitled
to
the
notice,
could
waive
this
requirement?
justice
white
well,
you
have
to
say
that
if
you
claim
the
jurisdictional,
i
suppose.
justice
white
and
a
court
would...
could
raise
it
on
its
own
motion,
would
have
to
raise
it
on
its
own
motion.
justice
white
what
do
you
gain
by
your
present
position?
counsel
has
said
the
case
will
be
refiled
if
necessary.
what
do
you
gain
except
to
effectuate
a
lot
of
waste,
judicially,
in
this
particular
case?
justice
white
that
isn't
what
the,
the
majority
said
absurd.
the
majority
raised
holy
trinity
and
it--
justice
white
--i
take
it
you
are,
maybe
you
don't
have
to
answer
this,
but
i
take
it
you
are
representing
the
views
of
the
epa?
