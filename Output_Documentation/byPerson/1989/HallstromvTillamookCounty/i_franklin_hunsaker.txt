mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
this
court
is
very
straightforward,
and
that
is
what
does
the
statute
mean.
the
answer
we
urge
the
court
to
adopt
is
that
the
statute
means
exactly
what
it
plainly
and
clearly
says,
that
plaintiff's
failure
to
comply
with
the
statutory
notice
requirement
before
filing
their
lawsuit,
constituted
a
defect
that
compelled
dismissal
of
the
lawsuit.
and
this
morning
i
intend
to
focus--
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
--i
think
it
does,
your
honor,
and
i
would
like
to
respond--
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
--it
doesn't
say
that
in
those
words,
but
i
think
the
overall
statute,
taking
all
of
the
sections
together,
and
the
statute
as
it
is
relevant
to
this
case
as
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
our
respondent's
brief.
i
would
like
to
touch
upon
the
words
of
the
statute,
its
plain,
ordinary
meaning;
if
you
construe
those
words
together,
why
it
compels
a
dismissal
in
this
case,
the
congressional
intent
which
this
court
recognized
in
the
1987
gwaltney
of
smithfield
versus
chesapeake
bay--
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
--i
don't
think
you
do,
justice
white.
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
that
is
correct.
but
this
morning
is
the
first
time
i
have
heard
plaintiff's
attorney
concede...
i
believe
he
conceded
that
commence
means
begin
or
initiate.
in
the
past,
and
i
think
their
briefs
are
replete
with
the
argument...
that
and
before
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals...
replete
with
the
argument
that
commence
means
other
than
to
initiate
or
begin.
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
i'd
also
this
morning
like
to
touch
upon
a
matter
that
several
of
the
justices
raised
this
morning,
and
that
is
why
a
decision
by
this
court
affirming
the
court
of
appeals
and
construing
the
statute
as
written
will
bring
about
predictability
and
even-handed
administration
of
this
law,
rather
than
the
litigation
generating
result
advanced
by
the
plaintiffs.
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
there
is
no
question
about
that,
justice
o'connor,
and
i
think
this
court
has
said
on
a
number
of
occasions
that
the
court's
sympathy
for
a
particular
plaintiff
is
no
reason
to
ignore
the
clear
meaning
of
a
statute.
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
it
has,
but
justice
o'connor,
those
cases
do
not
contain
anywhere
near
the
kind
of
clear
language,
we
submit,
that
is
in
this
statute.
it,
i
really
believe
that,
as
i
said
a
few
minutes
ago,
that
the
plaintiffs
are
essentially
urging,
by
their
argument,
that
the
word
commence
means
maintaine.
and
i
submit
that
the
concurring
opinion
of
justice
scalia
in
gwaltney,
and
joined
in
by
justices
stevens
and
o'connor,
draws
that
distinction
between
commence
and
maintain,
and
it
just,
it's
untenable
to
say
that
it
means
something
other
than
what
it
says.
but
as
to
the
argument
that
somehow
this
statute
does
not
speak,
the
notice
provision
is
not
jurisdictional.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
i
believe
in
her
question,
the
subsection
(a)
which
speaks
in
terms
of
jurisdiction...
that
provides
that
a
citizen
may
bring
this
law
suit,
this
kind
of
lawsuit...
expressly
begins
with
the
words
except
as
provided
in
subsection
(b)
or
(c)
of
this
section
any
person
may
commence.
so
you
can't
read
subsections
(a)
and
(b)
separately.
they
have
to
be
read
together.
and
i
think
by
saying
that
somehow,
as
the
plaintiffs
have
said,
that
subsection
(b),
the
notice
provision,
is
entirely
separate,
to
use
their
words,
from
subsection
(a)
just
doesn't
follow.
it's
tied
in.
and
that
subsection
(b)
is
titled,
"actions
prohibited".
and
that
was
in
the
original
act
as
passed
by
congress.
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
justice
white,
i
think
it
is
not
an
adequate
remedy,
again
because
of
the
clear
words,
the
use
of
prohibited--
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
--prohibited.
prohibited.
no
action.
you
cannot
bring
this
action,
it
is
prohibited.
or
it
cannot
be
commenced,
begun,
by
filing
the
complaint.
they
had...
if
you
say
it
can
be
stayed,
you
said
that
the
words
prohibit
and
commenced
are
meaningless,
or
don't
mean
what
they
say,
because
you
have
said
that
you
can
go
ahead
and
commence
but
we
will
stay,
but
you
can't
maintain
it
until
you
give
the
notice
or
the
60
days
runs.
so
i
think
those
two
words
show
that
the
congress
did,
in
fact,
intend
for
this
to
be
a
prohibition
and
require
a
dismissal.
but
the
more...
i
think
an
equally
important
reason
is
the
overall
statutory
scheme;
it
wasn't
to
allow
citizens
to
come
in
and
file
these
suits
without
first
triggering
the
administrative
action.
and
as
this
court
recognized
in
gwaltney,
the
primary
enforcement
tool
is
supposed,
should
be
the
administrative
agencies,
either
the
epa
or
the
state.
as
the
court
said
in
gwaltney,
the
central
purpose
of
these
citizen
provisions,
and
they
were
talking
about
now
the
clean
air
and
clean
water
acts
which
are
identical
to
this
act,
the
central
purpose
of
these
provisions
is
to
permit
citizens
to
abate
pollution
when
the
government
cannot
or
will
not
command
compliance.
and
the
court
in
gwaltney
also
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
citizen
suit
notice
provision
is
to
give
the
alleged
violator
an
opportunity
to
bring
itself
into
complete
compliance
and
render
unnecessary
a
citizen
suit.
but
significantly
they
said
it
is
intended
to
encourage
citizen
participation,
but
only
as
a
supplement
or
secondary
to.
justice
white,
if
you
say
that
you
can
simply
stay
these
procedures,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
no
notice
has
been
given,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
undermine
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statutory
scheme
which
is
clearly
set
forth
that
the
primary
purpose
is
to
allow
the
agencies
to
enforce.
and,
in
fact,
it
is
significant,
as
one
of
the
justices
pointed
out
this
morning,
that
one
of
the,
the
statute
clearly
provides
that
if
the
government,
the
administrator
or
state
has
commenced
and
is
diligently
prosecuting
a
civil
or
criminal
action
in
a
court
of
the
united
states,
no
citizen
suit
can
be
maintained.
that
is
in
subsection
(b)
too.
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
well,
i
guess
my
first
response
would
be
that
is
clearly
not
the
case
here,
but
no,
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
right.
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
yes.
if
it
is
jurisdictional
it
could
be
raised
at
any
time
as
the,
as
has
been
done
where
courts
have
raised
it.
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
one
case
relied
upon
by
plaintiffs
raised
it
for
the
first
time
on
appeal.
but,
so
i
think
the
words,
the
statutory
scheme,
the
congressional
intent
as
evidenced
in
that
statutory
scheme
was
to
bring
about
a
meaningful
opportunity
for
the
agencies
to
have
the
opportunity
to
have
the
first
bite
at
the
apple,
if
you
will,
and
eliminating
the
need
for
citizen
law
suits--
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
--perhaps
little
in
this
case,
justice
blackmun,
but
i
think
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
what
is
gained
by
this
court
enforcing
the,
or
construing
the
statute
as
written
and
saying
that
it
must
be...
a
notice
must
be
given
and,
if
not,
a
case
must
be
dismissed...
is
that
predictability
in
the
future,
even
handed
administration
of
the
law--
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
--well,
there
were
no
attorney
fees
awarded,
and
that
was
one
of
the
bases
for
the
appeal
taken
by
the
plaintiffs
to
the
ninth
circuit,
was
that
no
attorney
fees
were
awarded.
i
think
the
record
demonstrates
that
while
this
matter
went
to
trial
the
relief
sought
by
the
plaintiffs
was
not
anywheres
near
what
they
had
wanted.
and
while
the
court
did
enter
an
order
requiring
the
county
to
bring
about
some
corrections
to
the
landfill,
it
refused
to
close
down
the
landfill
as
the
plaintiffs
had
requested.
and
it
ended
up
not
awarding
any
fees,
as
it
was
within
its
discretion
to
do.
but
i'd
like
to
amplify,
if
i
may,
on
this
clear
bright
line
that
we
asked
this
court
to
draw
in
this
case
because
of
the
predictability
aspect.
if
this
court
draws
that
bright
line
and
says
that
a
citizen
must
give
at
least
60
days
notice
before
commencing
a
lawsuit
and
if
not
then
the
lawsuit
must
be
dismissed,
i
think
you
make
the
statute
and
its
enforcement
predictable,
and
you
make
it
even-handed.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
hold,
as
the
plaintiffs
contend,
that
the
suit
may
be
stayed
until
the
requisite
notice
is
given,
you
make
every
citizen
suit
amenable
to
appeals
and
after
the
fact
wrangling
over
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff,
the
citizen,
complied
with
the
statute
and
whether
adequate
notice
was
given,
whether
the
administrative
agencies,
if
you
will,
were
given
that
meaningful
opportunity.
and
i
think
that
will
surely
guarantee
endless
litigation
and
wasteful
litigation.
it
is
significant
in
this
case,
or
telling,
that
the
district
court
premised
his
decision
denying
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
which
was
raised,
which
was
filed
as
soon
as
the
defendant,
the
county
found
out
about
the
lack
of
notice,
based
its
decision
on
the
fact
that
it
would
be
a
waste
of
judicial
resources
to
dismiss.
and
we
submit
that
what
has
happened
has
been
a
waste
of
judicial
resources,
and,
in
fact,
if
this
court
were
to
rule
in
favor
of
the
plaintiffs
as
they
contend
that
would
amount
to
a
waste
of
judicial
resources
in
the
future.
it
will
impose
a
hardship
on
these
plaintiffs,
no
question,
if
this
court
affirms
the
court
of
appeals.
but
imagine
what
would
have
happened
if
in
march
or
april
of
1983
when
we
filed,
when
the
county
filed
its
motion,
the
district
court
would
have
granted
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
and
dismissed
the
lawsuit
because
of
the
undisputed
failure
by
the
plaintiffs
to
file
their
notice.
and
plaintiffs
could
then
have
given
the
60
days
notice
and
then
refiled
their
lawsuit,
as
they
indicated
in
their
notice
that
they
ultimately
gave
the
epa
and
deq
a
year
after
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
they
could
have
refiled.
we
would
have
gone
ahead,
tried
the
case
without
any
jurisdictional
cloud
hanging
over
the
case,
and
we
wouldn't
be
here
before
this
court
today.
and
i
think
that
demonstrates
why
a
clear
bright
line
will
avoid
waste
of
judicial
resources.
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
if
i
understand
your
question,
justice
blackmun,
it
would
be
avoided
simply
because
you
wouldn't
have
these
lawsuits
going
on,
as
this
one
did,
with
an
appellate
court
ending
up
saying
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
the
first
place.
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
two
to
one,
two
to
one.
mr.
i.
franklin
hunsaker
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy,
it
wouldn't
happen.
but
we
submit
what
would,
the
dangerous
precedent
that
we
would
be
set
would
be
clogging
of
the
courts
as
you
pointed
out.
we
submit
in
conclusion
that
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
ruled
based
on
judge
wisdom's
sound
reasoning
in
the
garcia
case,
first
that
the
notice
requirement
is
part
of
the
jurisdictional
conferral
from
congress
that
cannot
be
altered
by
the
courts,
that
anything
other
than
a
literal
interpretation
of
the
plain
language
of
the
notice
requirement
would
effectively
render
the
provision
worthless;
and
that
to
rule
as
plaintiffs
contend
would
in
effect
constitute
judicial
amendment
in
abrogation
of
explicit,
unconditional
statutory
language.
on
that
basis
we
ask
that
this
court
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
