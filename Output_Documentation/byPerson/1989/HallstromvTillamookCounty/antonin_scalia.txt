justice
scalia
congress
could
have
written
it
that
way.
congress
could
have
said,
you
know,
no
action
may
be
commenced
unless
the
administrator
has
been
given
notice
or
is
given
notice
within
a
reasonable
period
after
commencement.
it
could
have
written
it
a
lot
of
different
ways.
it
happened
to
write
it
this
way,
and
this
way
you...
you're
clearly
wrong.
you
have
an
appealing
case,
your
case,
because
the
judge
told
you
never
mind,
i
won't
dismiss
the
suit,
go
file,
don't,
you'll
just
have
to
file
it
all
over
again,
we'll
shortcut
it
all.
i
agree
that
your
case
is
an
appealing
one,
but
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
a
general
rule
that
will
permit
this
to
be
done
regularly.
i
wish
you
were
just
arguing
some
kind
of
judicial
estoppel
or
something,
but
that
is
not
what
you're
arguing.
justice
scalia
well,
no,
you're
arguing
the
statute
should
generally,
for
everyone,
be
interpreted
this
way
so
that
judges
in
the
future
can
do
just
what
this
judge
did
here,
and
could
say,
it
doesn't
matter
that
you
haven't
given
notice.
so
long
as
it's
here,
give
notice
now,
and
we'll
keep
the
case.
that
is
how
i
read
your
brief.
justice
scalia
right.
so
that
district
courts
can
rewrite
the
statute.
justice
scalia
we
are
not
in
the
business
of
enforcing
intent.
we
are
in
the
business
of
enforcing
statutes.
there
are
a
lot
of
different
ways
of
achieving
the
possible
congressional
intent.
it
chose
one
way,
and
you
acknowledged
the
word
commenced
means
commenced.
justice
scalia
well,
i
suspect
there
are
cases
where
we've
stuck
by
the
strict
wording
and
cases
where
we
haven't
struck
by,
stuck
by
the
strict
wording.
is
there
any
rhyme
nor
reason
to
when
we
do
and
when
we
don't?
justice
scalia
it
had
served
the
purpose
of
making
that
inquiry
unnecessary
in
future
cases.
if
we
simply
held
today
commenced
means
commenced,
you
can
look
on
the
paper
record
and
say,
you
know,
was
the
notice
given
before
it
was
commenced
or
not?
that
is
an
end
of
the
matter.
what
you
argue
for
is
a
rule
that
says,
in
every
case
we'll
have
to
look
to
whether
the
substance
of
the
rule,
whether
the
real
purpose
to
be
achieved
by
the
rule,
was
somehow
achieved
in
another
fashion.
if
your
case
is
an
exception,
i
don't
know
how
many
others
there
are
out
there
that
the
lower
courts
might
have
to
wrestle
with.
justice
scalia
well,
this
won't
be
exceptional
if
we
say
that
this
doesn't
mean
what
it
says,
is
what
i
am
saying.
this
case
will
not
be
exceptional.
if
this
exception
can
be
made,
why
not
a
lot
of
other
ones
that
achieve
the
substantial
purpose
of
the
statute?
justice
scalia
the
result
in
holy
trinity...
that
was
a
case
in
which
a
statute
categorically
prohibited
the
importation
of
people
to
work
in
the
court
just
out
of
whole
cloth
created
an
exception
for
clergymen.
justice
scalia
you
thought
that
was
a
correct
result?
justice
scalia
they
didn't
make
a
skilled
laborer
exception;
they
made
a
clergyman
except.
justice
scalia
mr.
buckley,
that
is
not
fair.
i
really
don't
think
it
is
a
judicial
hoop,
and
i
don't
see
why
you
say
it
is
a
matter
of
interpreting
it
strictly.
i
think
that
is
fair
language
where
you
have
an
ambiguous
word
and
you
can
interpret
it
one
way
or
another.
but
this
is
not
at
all
ambiguous.
it
says
no
action
may
be
commenced.
justice
scalia
it
happens
to
be
the
sentence
that
relates
to
the
matter
at
issue
here.
justice
scalia
well,
what
about
the
holy
trinity
case,
mr.
martin?
