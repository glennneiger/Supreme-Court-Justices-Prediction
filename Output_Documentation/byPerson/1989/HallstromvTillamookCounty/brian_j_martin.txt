mr.
brian
j.
martin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is,
we
submit,
a
case
of
statutory
construction.
it
is
not
a
case
that
asks
the
court
to
adopt
the
best
rule
or
to
interpret
one
of
its
own
rules
or
a
rule
of
federal
common
law.
so
to
answer
your
question,
justice
white,
this
isn't
a
case
that
poses
a
question
is
the
stay
more
efficient
than
complete
dismissal.
we
submit
that
dismissal
is
required
by
the
statute.
congress
said
that
a
certain
type
of
action
is
rcra,
but
brought
without
prior
notice
and
a
60
day
waiting
period.
such
action
is
prohibited.
we
don't
think
there
is
any
basis
for
this
court
to
adopt
a
stay
which
would
be
inconsistent
with
that
ruling,
because
a
stayed
action
was
nevertheless
commenced
without
prior
notice.
petitioners
have
framed
the
question
as
to
whether
the
prior
notice
requirement
is
mandatory
or
procedural,
and
we
think
that
that
mistakes,
that
is
their
primary
mistake,
because
it
is
both.
it
is
a
rule
of
congress,
a
statute
of
congress
which
is
partly
procedural
but
it
is
mandatory.
we
can
see
no
exceptions
in
the
express
terms
of
the
statute
and
we
have
heard
no
evidence
from
petitioners
which
would
evidence
an
implied
exception.
they
have
mentioned
in
their
brief
a
concept
of
equitable
modification.
i
don't
know
what
that
means.
if
a
statute
is
not
unconstitutional
and
there
are
no
exceptions
expressed
or
implied,
i
don't
know
how
this
court
gets
the
authority
or
where
it
derives
the
authority
to
adopt
a
different
rule.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
i'm
not
on
the
holy
trinity
team
today,
i
don't
think.
[laughter]
i'm
on
the
plain
meaning
team
today.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
well,
that's
right.
there
are
cases,
last
year
in
public
citizens
against
the
department
of
justice
case,
there
can
be
a
statute
where
the
result
just
seems
too
odd,
absurd,
unbelievable,
congress--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--difficult
to
fathom,
unlikely
to
believe,
difficult
to
fathom.
others
would
have
required
absurdity.
but
neither
is
present
in
this
case.
the
statutory
scheme
is
completely
coherent
if
it
is
applied
according
to
its
terms.
in
fact
we,
there
may
be
some
inefficiency
in
particular
cases.
this
is
one.
but
that
has
never
been
a
reason,
as
justice
o'connor
noted,
to
disregard
the
statute.
and
i
don't
know
that
there
is,
the
court
need
to
be
too
concerned
about
sympathy
for
the
plaintiff
in
this
case
because
the
plaintiff
lost
on
its
state
law
judgments
which
were
vacated
along
with
the
federal
court
judgments.
so
they
have
resurrected
their
state
common
law
claims
for
trespassing
and
reverse
condemnation
and
the
like.
that
is
largely
beside
the
point,
i
just
wanted
to
bring
it
up
because
it
came
up
earlier.
so
we
do
not
think
this
is
a
case
like
newman-green
where
the
question
is,
does
the
court
have
some
authority
to
adopt
a
procedural
rule
in
the
absence
of
congressional
action.
congress
has
spoken
to
this
question
and
we
think
that
it
is
mandatory.
we
have
seen
no
exceptions
implied
or
expressed.
to
answer
justice
rehnquist's
first
observation,
however,
i
suppose
this
case
does
not
present
the
question
whether
the
requirement
is
jurisdictional
in
its
strictest
sense.
could
it
be
waived
if
it
is
not
raised
by
a
defendant,
could
it
be
noticed
first
by
the
court
on
appeal
or
the
supreme
court.
it
does
not
present
that
question
because
it
was
raised
by
the
defendant
in
the
summary
judgment
motion.
and,
also,
it
does
not
present
the
question
could
the
epa
waive
or
be
estopped
from
asserting
some
sort
of
requirement
to
notes
because
the
epa
frankly
was
not
notified.
we
think--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--i
am.
and
they
take
the
prior
notice
requirement
seriously,
for
two
reasons.
one,
the
government,
the
epa
in
particular,
is
primarily
designated
to
enforcing
environmental
laws.
they
welcome
citizen
suits;
citizens
are
encouraged
to
become
involved.
but
the
epa
wants
to
know
about
these
suits
and
they
can
have
an
effect
in
compromising
or
preventing
some
litigation,
both
ways.
they
can
bring
pressure
to
bear
on
a
defendant
or
they
could
point
out
to
a
potential
plaintiff
you
don't
have
a
case.
and
then
with
rule
11
such
a
plaintiff
might
not
come
to
courts.
so
we
think
that
really
the
incongruent
result
would
be
from
petitioners'
reading
of
the
statute,
which
would
make
the
prior
requirement
somewhat
trivial.
why
would
a
plaintiff
give
prior
notice.
if
it
is
not
raised
it
would
be
waived,
and
even
if
it
is
raised,
you
could
give
notice
at
that
time.
so
we
think
that
congress
certainly
thought
there
was
an
important
reason
to
have
prior
notice.
the
epa
believes
that
notice
is
important.
so,
we
think
that
there
is
nothing
to
recommend
an
approach
that
would
make
that
requirement,
if
not
meaningless,
less
important
and
perhaps
trivial.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
yes.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
no,
i
think
an
action
is
commenced
when
you
file
a
complaint.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
actions
are
commenced
and
they
remain
on
the
court's
docket
until
they
are
dismissed
for
some
reason.
a
court
could,
on
its
own
motion,
decide
there
is
no
jurisdiction
and
dismiss
it.
but
it
is
commenced,
there
is
a
docket
number,
you
have
to
respond.
you're
at
some
risk,
i
would
think,
as
the
defendant
perhaps
until
it
is
dismissed.
the
action
was
commenced,
but
it
was
a
prohibited
action
when
it
was
commenced.
that
is
our
point.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
well,
the
facts
of
this
case--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--is
it
jurisdictional,
could
it
be
waived
by
a
defendant?
we
think
not,
but
we
seriously
do
not
think
it
is
presented
by
this
case
because
it
was
raised
as
a
defense
in
the
normal
course
of
litigation,
timely--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--well,
we
think
that
remedy
is
plainly
inconsistent
with
the
statute,
whether
it
is
a
jurisdictional
requirement
that
can
never
be
waived
or...
we're
talking
about
an
intent
of
congress,
so
congress
can
intend
anything
they
want
along
these
lines.
we
know
that
congress
did
not
want
this
action
to
proceed.
now,
whether
it
would
allow
another
action
to
proceed
if
a
defendant
didn't
raise
it
until
it
was
up
on
court
of
appeals
or
in
this
court,
that
is
not
presented.
in
such
a
case,
a
party
would
have
to
give
some
evidence
that
congress
legislated
against
the
background
of
waiver
laws
and
estoppel
laws,
something
like
zipes,
where
this
court
held
that
requirement
was
like
a
statute
of
limitations
where
congress
knows
of
the
background
of
waiver
and
estoppel.
that
would
be
a
different
case.
but
we
know
that
this
case
was,
is
one
that
congress
thought
was
prohibited,
that
the
objection
was
raised
in
a
timely
manner.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
i
believe
it
would
be
commenced.
commenced--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--i
mean
what
rule
3
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
mean,
an
action
is
commenced
by
filing
a
complaint.
so,
if
it
looks
like
a
complaint,
it
is
commenced.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
think
the
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
