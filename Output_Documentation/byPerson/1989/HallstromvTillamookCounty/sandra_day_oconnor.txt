justice
o'connor
well,
the
language
of
the
statute,
of
course,
is
rather
explicit.
it
says
that
subsection
(a)
authorizes
citizens
to
commit
civil
actions,
except
as
provided
in
subsection
(b)
or
(c).
and
subsection
(b)
says
actions
prohibited...
no
action
may
be
commenced
under
subsection
(a)
unless
the
notice
is
given.
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
that's
pretty
explicit.
justice
o'connor
well,
of
course
it's
possible
that
the
legislative
history
here
indicates
that
at
least,
in
part,
those
provisions
were
intended
to
prevent
the
federal
courts
from
having
to
deal
with
litigation
until
after
the
government
agencies
had
an
opportunity
at
least
to
act.
justice
o'connor
you
have
to
argue
that
this
is
one
of
those
rare
instances
when
the
court
shouldn't
apply
the
statute
as
it
is
written.
justice
o'connor
that
is
basically
what
you
are
saying,
that
we
shouldn't--
justice
o'connor
--we
don't
do
that
very
often,
but
you
think
that's
what
we
should
do
here.
justice
o'connor
and
yet,
it
certainly
would
be
workable
as
a
scheme
and
as
a
statute
if
we
did
enforce
it
as
it's
written.
justice
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
once
the
rule
is
clear
that
people
would
understand
that
that
is
the
requirement?
so
how
would
it
result
in
injustices
thereafter?
justice
o'connor
if
this
case
had
to
be
refiled,
do
you
think
the
county
would
immediately
resume
the
action
that
it
had
previously
taken,
or
do
you
think
the
problem
is
now
corrected?
justice
o'connor
and
you
think
that
if
this
suit
had
to
be
refiled
that
the
county
would
go
right
back
to
its
former
practices?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
might,
but
it
certainly
results
in
some
unfortunate,
an
unfortunate
situation
in
this
case,
doesn't
it?
justice
o'connor
and,
of
course,
the
court
has
overlooked,
apparently,
clear
meaning
in
the
title
7
context?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
it
is
dismissed
i
guess
the
county
doesn't
pay
the
attorneys
fees
and
costs?
justice
o'connor
well,
doesn't
that
force
you
to
confront
the
nature
of
the
remedy
that
must
be
imposed
and
whether
it
is
jurisdictional
in
the
true
sense
or
whether
it
is
waivable,
or
whether
the
court
could
enter
a
stay?
justice
o'connor
it
seems
to
me
that
you
can't
avoid
answering
the
chief
justice's
inquiry.
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
the
lower
court
took
the
position
that
it
could
remedy
it
by
entering
a
stay
and
allowing--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
it
requires
the
court
to
determine
whether
compliance
with
the
notice
provision
of
the
resource
conservation
and
recovery
act
of
1976
is
a
mandatory
precondition
to
commencing
suit
against
an
alleged
violator
of
the
regulations
of
that
act.
section
6972(b)
of
that
act
prohibits
the
commencement
of
such
an
action
until
60
days
after
the
parties
have
notified
the
appropriate
state
and
federal
agencies
and
the
alleged
violator
of
their
intention
to
bring
suit.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
hold
that
compliance
with
the
notice
and
60-day
delay
requirement
mandated
by
the
act
is
a
mandatory,
not
an
optional,
prerequisite
to
suit
under
the
act.
nothing
in
the
language,
structure,
or
legislative
history
of
the
statute
permits
us
to
disregard
its
plain
meaning
or
to
allow
equitable
modification
of
the
statutory
requirement.
accordingly,
if
a
party
fails
to
comply
with
the
60-day
notice
requirement,
the
district
court
must
dismiss
the
action
as
barred
by
the
terms
of
the
statute.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
accordingly
affirmed.
justice
marshall
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
with
which
justice
brennan
joins.
