justice
kennedy
or
is
it
a
good
idea
to
have
a
rule
that
everybody
can
understand?
justice
kennedy
in
this
case,
i
take
it,
under
this
statute,
one
of
the
prohibitions
on
bringing
this
suit
is
if
the
government
has
itself
brought
a
suit,
correct?
justice
kennedy
and
how
do
you
know
whether
or
not
that
statutory
exception
has
been
met
by
the
government?
justice
kennedy
yes.
what
do
you
look
for?
the
first
thing
you
do
to
see
whether
action,
what...
has
been
filed?
justice
kennedy
but
isn't,
doesn't,
isn't
the
point
that
the
statute
(b)(2)
says
that
if
the
administrator
or
state
has
commenced
and
is
diligently
prosecuting.
justice
kennedy
so
the
statute
itself
makes
a
distinction
between
commencement
and
prosecution,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
we
should
interpret
the
word
commencement
the
same
way
in
the
previous
paragraph.
justice
kennedy
but
if
that
is
so,
commencement
means
filing,
doesn't
it?
justice
kennedy
but
if
you
agree
with
that
it
seems
to
me
that
you
must
lose,
because
you
commenced
the
action
without
going
through
the
waiting
period
and
the
notice
period.
justice
kennedy
counsel,
we
are
telling
district
courts
all
over
the
country
to
expedite
their
dockets.
we
are
telling
them
the
minute
a
case
is
filed
to
call
the
counsel
in,
to
schedule
it.
under
your
rule,
the
judge
would
first
be
required
to
determine
whether
or
not
notice
had
been...
can
be
given
over
a
period
of
time.
it
would
have
to
enter
a
stay
order.
it
would
then
have
to
wait
to
see
if
the
administrator
or
the
state
has
commenced.
and
under
your
interpretation
of
commenced,
it's
not
even
clear
when
the
administrator
or
the
state
has
commenced.
so
you
are
compounding
the
work
in
the
district
courts,
and
you
must
not
forget
that
case
load
and
expeditious
management
is
really
one
of
the
keys
to
justice.
justice
kennedy
yes,
that
is
circular
because
if
we
rule
for
the
plaintiff
then
that
won't
happen.
you
have
assumed
the
point.
if
we
rule
for
the
plaintiff
then
it
won't
be
an
issue
any
more.
