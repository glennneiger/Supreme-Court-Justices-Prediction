justice
blackmun
counsel,
there
is
comment
through
these
papers
that
once
a
suit
is
filed
the
position
of
the
parties
hardens,
and
that
this
is
one
reason
for
the
preliminary
giving
of
notice
before
the
commencement
of
an
action.
you
haven't
commented
on
that,
today
anyway.
do
you
have
any
comments?
justice
blackmun
but,
presumably,
with
the
same
result
that
took
place
the
first
time.
presumably.
how
can
you
escape
the
waste
of
judicial
resources
and
time
and
attorneys
time
and
everything
else?
justice
blackmun
well,
maybe
the
appellate
court
was
wrong.
after
all,
it
was
a
divided
decision,
wasn't
it?
