justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
though,
at
that
time,
was
one
of
the
grounds
of
the
motion
the
failure
to
comply
with
the
notice
requirement?
justice
stevens
the
whole
ground,
yeah.
justice
stevens
mr.
martin,
may
i
go
back
to
justice
white's
concern
earlier
that
the
language
is
plain
as
to
the
duty
not
to
commence
the
action,
but
that
the
statute
is
silent
as
to
the
remedy
for
violating
that
duty.
do
you
think
in
this
case
an
action
was
commenced?
justice
stevens
if
it
was
commenced,
then
the
question
is
what
is
the
remedy
for
violating
the
statute.
you
don't
take
the
position
that
the
action
was
never
commenced?
justice
stevens
well
then
if
it
has
been
commenced,
how
can
you
say
there
is
a
wad
of
jurisdiction?
