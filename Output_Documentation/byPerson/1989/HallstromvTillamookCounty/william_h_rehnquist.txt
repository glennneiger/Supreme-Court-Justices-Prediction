chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-42,
olaf
a.
hallstrom
versus
tillamook
county.
mr.
buckley,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
buckley,
you
say
the
case
came
on
for
hearing;
this
was
in
the
district
court
in
portland--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--what
sort
of
a
hearing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
hearing
on
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
filed
by
your
opponents?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
wonder,
mr.
buckley,
if
you
are
quite
right
in
calling
the
question
here,
is
it
a
jurisdictional
requirement.
to
me
a
jurisdictional
requirement
might
mean
that,
if
you
had
litigated
this
issue
without
it
ever
having
been,
litigated
you
case
without
the
question
ever
having
been
raised
all
through
the
district
court,
the
ninth
circuit,
the
judgment
become
final,
you
know,
could
it
be
set
aside
because
the
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction.
we
are
not
obviously
talking
about
something
like
that.
we're
just
talking
about
a
precondition
to
the
commencement
of
the
action.
now,
whether
that
is
"jurisdictional"
or
not,
i
don't
know,
but
i
wonder
if
it
is
quite
that
stark
a
requirement.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
we
don't
have
to
follow
the
interpretation
of
the
ninth
circuit
if
we
are
not
convinced
of
its
wisdom.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i,
you
know,
to
the
extent
that
the
requirement
would
prevent
you
from
proceeding
with
your
suit
and
refiling,
and
still
not
be
a
jurisdictional
one,
that
analysis
really
doesn't
help
you.
i
mean,
the
analysis
i
have
suggested
i
don't
think
helps
your
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
how
stringent
is
the
requirement
is
really
what
we're
talking
about.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
the
name
of
that
court
case,
mr.
buckley?
chief
justice
rehnquist
oh,
it's
a
district
court
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
buckley.
mr.
hunsaker.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hunsaker.
mr.
martin,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
like,
the
holy
trinity
team
is
kind
of
like
the
hail
mary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
martin.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-42,
hallstrom
versus
tillamook
county
will
be
announced
by
justice
oâ€™connor.
