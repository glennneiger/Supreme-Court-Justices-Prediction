mr.
donald
john
zelenka
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
being
presented
before
this
court
is
whether
arizona
v.
roberson,
a
decision
of
this
court
during
the
last
term,
has
retroactive
application
under
this
court's
analysis
in
teague
v.
lane
to
a
situation
in
which
a
confession
was
entered
in
1980
and
an
appeal
was
raised
that
was
resolved
in
1982.
it
is
our
position
that
the
decision
of
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
when
it
concluded
that
arizona
v.
roberson
should
not
be
applied
in
this
case,
is
well
founded
in
the
decisions
of
this
particular
court.
in
the
fourth
circuit's
decision,
it
stated
that
we
are
fully
satisfied
that
butler
may
not
claim
any
retroactive
benefit
from
roberson.
in
their
panel
decision
the
court
held
that
the
interrogation
was
conducted
in
strict
accordance
with
the
established
law
in
1980,
and
there
was
no
support
in
the
record
that
there
was
any
actual
violation
of
his
fifth
amendment
rights
in
1980.
the
court
found
in
its
lower
decision
that
it
was
undisputed
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
all
the
way
through
the
court
that
butler
twice
evidences
knowing
consent
to
interrogation
without
the
presence
of
counsel
by
signing
his
waiver
with
full
understanding
of
his
rights
to
counsel,
particularly
asserting
that
he
did
not
want
to
have
a
lawyer
represent
him
in
these
particular
proceedings.
every--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--there
was...
according
to
the
record
that
is
before
this
court,
there
was
a
statement
given
at
that
particular
time,
according
to
the
testimony--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--yes.
there
was
a
statement
given.
subsequent
to
that
statement
being
given
on
august
31st,
there
was
a
bond
hearing
on
the
unrelated
assault
charge,
at
which
time,
and
for
the
first
time,
we
would
submit,
retained
counsel
appeared
on
his
behalf.
later
that
evening,
after,
we
would
submit,
there
was
a
reasonable
opportunity
for
mr.
butler
to
have
consulted
with
his
counsel,
at
approximately
12:50
in
the
morning,
which
would
be
on
september
1st,
1980,
another
interrogation
began.
at
the
outset
of
that
interrogation,
it
is
undisputed
before
this
court,
we
would
submit,
that
sergeant
frasier
did
give
his
miranda
warnings
to
mr.
butler,
first
orally,
then
in
writing.
mr.
butler
then
gave
an
initial
statement
in
which
he
acknowledged
some
knowledge
of
the
particular
murder
that
he
was
charged
with.
it
is
important
to
note
that
at
the
outset
of
the
interrogation,
before
the
miranda
warnings
were
given,
sergeant
frasier
particularly
advised
him
that
you
are
being
charged
now
with
the
murder
of
pamela
lane
and
that
will
be
the
focus
of
the
particular
inquiry
in
this
case.
during
the
miranda
warnings
that
were
given
after
that
information
was
given
to
him,
on
two
occasions
mr.
butler
advised
him,
when
asked
about
his
knowledge
of
his
right
to
counsel,
he
asserted
clearly,
unequivocally,
i
do
not
want
a
lawyer.
i
do
not
want
a
lawyer
in
these
particular
matters.
and
then
he
chose
to
give
his
statement,
his
initial
statement.
when
further
information
was
revealed
to
him
by
sergeant
frasier,
after
the
initial
statement
was
given,
miranda
warnings
were
again
presented
to
him,
he
waived
his
right
to
counsel,
sustenance
during
the
interrogation,
again
at
that
time,
and
entered
a
statement
in
which
he
admitted
some
significant
involvement
in
this
crime.
those
statements--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--yes,
sir.
it
occurred
between
the
hours
of
12:50
and--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--there
is
no
explanation
in
this
particular
record--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--the
record...
that
was
not
a
disputed
part
of
the
record
before
this
court.
at
the
time
of
the
suppression
hearing
there
was
an
assertion
made
by
mr.
butler
that
he
was
lacking
sleep.
at
that
particular
time
that
was
a
situation
that
was
resolved
against
him,
when
he
was
advised
in
the
language
of
the
lower
courts'
conclusion
was
that
he
was
not
sleepy.
he
was
provided
with
a
number
of
breaks,
and
he
was
freely
advised
of
his
right
to
remain
silent
and
chose
not
to
do
so
throughout
that
period
of
interrogation.
it
is
clear,
they
very
possibly
could
have
waited
until
morning.
the
law
enforcement
officers
chose
not
to
do
so.
mr.
butler
was
aware
of
his
right
to
remain
silent;
he
did
not
need
to
involve
himself
in
the
interrogation
process
at
that
time,
should
he
have
chosen
not
to
do
so.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
there...
according
to
the
record
there
were
always
two
officers
present
at
the
time
of
the
interrogation.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
sergeant
frasier
was
consistent
from
the
outset
of
the
interrogation
throughout.
there
was
another
officer;
two
other
officers
assisted
in
the
drafting
of
the
particular
written
statements
that
he
gave.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
there
were
three--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--certainly,
it
is
clear
in
the
record
that
there
were
at
least
three
coffee
breaks
where
donuts
were
given
to
the
defendant,
at
which
time
no
interrogation
occurred
and
the
defendant
was
free
to
take
whatever
choice
he
did
on
his
rights
to
remain
silent
during
that
time
period.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
sir.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
sir,
he
was
in
custody,
but
he
was
free,
based
upon
the
miranda
warnings
that
were
given
to
him
on
numerous
occasions
throughout
that
evening,
to
remain
silent
at
any
time.
in
fact,
prior
to
the...
the
trip
out
to
the
crime
scene,
he
was
given
the
opportunity
to
determine
whether
in
fact
he
wanted
to
leave
or
to
stay...
leave
and
return
to
the
jail,
or
stay
and
assist
them
in
going
to
the
crime
scene,
and
he
clearly,
again,
made
an
unequivocal
statement
that
he
would
go
on
at
that
time.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
we
have
raised
in
our
second
argument
that
roberson
would
not
be
applicable
to
this
situation
because
he
never
evidenced
a
right
to
have
the
assistance
of
counsel
during
his
interrogation,
during
any
interrogation
or
particular
time
period,
and
that
counsel
had
been
made
available
to
him
at
the
time
of
the
bond
hearing,
and
he
made
a
decision
as
a
result
of
those
situations.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
they
assumed,
for
purposes
of
their
decision,
that
roberson
would
be
applicable
under
the
facts
of
the
case,
but
they
did
not
conclude,
we
would
submit,
with
finality
that
in
fact
he
would
be
entitled
to
relief
under
roberson.
that
was
an
assumption
for
the
purposes
of
this
decision
on
whether
roberson--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--yes,
we
did.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
on
basically
the
same
grounds
that
we
have
asserted
in
our
second
response,
that
it
would
not
have
applied.
and
the
court,
on
the
basis
of
the
assumption
that
it
presented,
did
not
accept
that,
and
we
have
raised
that
in
our
petition...
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
and
we
have
raised
that
before
this
court
as
our
second
argument.
but
we
would
submit
that,
under
this
court's
decision
in
arizona
v.
roberson,
that
the
teague
requirements
that
this
is
a
new
rule,
we
submit,
would
be
clearly
applicable.
this
was
the
first
time...
not
this,
but
the
court's
decision
in
arizona
v.
roberson,
was
in
fact
the
first
time
that
this
court
had
specifically
addressed
the
edwards
situation
to
a
situation
where
there
were
separate
interrogations.
in
arizona
v.
roberson,
it
focused
on
two
separate
investigations
at
that
time.
the
common
element
between
these
cases
and
this
case
was
a
continuous
custody,
but
a
significant
difference
was
that
in
arizona
v.
roberson
and
in
edwards
v.
arizona
counsel
was
requested
but
was
never
permitted
to
discuss
the
matters
with
the
accused
under
those
situations.
whereas,
in
our
situation,
counsel
was
made
available.
roberson
was
the
first
case
to
apply
edwards
bright-line
test
by
this
court
to
separate
investigations.
we
would
submit
it
is
a
new
rule
because
edwards
itself
concerned
the
same
particular
investigation.
as
the
dissent
in
roberson
noted,
the
rule
now
would
bar
law
enforcement
officers
from
questioning
suspects
about
an
unrelated
matter
if
in
custody,
and
that
he
has
requested
counsel
to
assist
in
that
particular
interrogation.
in
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
particularly
maine
v.
moulton,
the
court
held,
in
footnote
16,
that
incriminating
evidence
from
statements
pertaining
to
other
crimes
as
to
which
the
sixth
amendment,
right
to
counsel,
had
not
attached,
are
admissible
in
the
trial
on
those
particular
offenses,
even
though
that
same
information
and
the
results
of
those
types
of
interrogations
or
information
would
not
be
admissible
in
a
trial
on
the
original
crime.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
no,
he
was
not.
that
was
a--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--critical
distinction
that--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--he
was
in
custody
here
throughout
the
period
of
time.
in
moran
v.
burbine,
the
court
again
affirmed
the
court's
decision
in
maine.
but
particularly
noting
how
this
matter
would
be
considered
a
new
rule
was
justice
burger's...
chief
justice
burger's
dissent
in
maine
v.
moulton,
where
he
acknowledged
in
1986
that
until
the
day
the
prevailing
view
in
the
state
and
federal
courts
was
that
the
case
law
up
to
that
time,
under
messiah
and
its
successors,
did
not
protect
the
defendant
from
the
introduction
of
post-indictment
statements
deliberately
elicited
when
the
police
undertook
an
investigation
for
separate
crimes.
we
would
submit
that
those
types
of
understandings,
that
was
presented
throughout
the
united
states
by
the
state
court
jurisdictions,
clearly
revealed
that
when
a
separate
investigation
is
involved,
arizona
v.
roberson,
as
it
applied
the
edwards
situation,
created
a
new
rule
of
criminal
procedure
that
did
not
exist,
we
would
submit,
prior
to
the
time
roberson
was
decided.
many
state
courts,
we
noted
in
our
brief,
have
taken
the
position
that,
since
edwards
and
since
maine
v.
moulton,
have
accepted
the
view
that
edwards
did
not
apply
to
separate
investigations.
like
edwards
before
roberson,
we
would
submit,
is
a
new
rule
of
criminal
procedure.
edwards
v.
roberson
is
not
a
matter
of
a
constitutional
command,
but,
however,
it
is
a
court-made
rule
of
procedure
that,
we
would
submit,
do
not
require
the
application
under
the
retroactivity
principles
of
this
court.
here,
in
edwards
and
in
roberson,
it
was
developed
to
protect
from
police
badgering.
the
constitutional
issue...
the
current
constitutional
issue
and
the
constitutional
issue
that
was
available
to
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
his
trial
in
1981,
was
whether
he
knows
and
understands
his
constitutional
rights
and
is
willing
to
waive
them.
in
conclusion
on
this
particular
issue,
since
roberson
is
a
new
guideline,
it
should
not
be
applied
to
collateral
review,
since
it
does
not
fall
within
either
the
teague
exceptions
or
it
did
not
create
a
new
rule
under
those
particular
exceptions.
as
each
state
court
that
has
addressed
this
issue
has
held,
and
the
federal
courts
below,
butler
made
a
knowing
and
voluntary
statement
without
coercion,
and
he
waived
his
fifth
amendment
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel
during
the
interrogation
in
this
particular
case.
the
written
and
oral
warnings
were
given.
a
clear
and
unequivocal
waiver
was
made
on
the
record,
and
no
request
for
the
assistance
of
counsel
on
the
murder
charge
was
ever
done.
now,
some
nine
years
later,
butler
seeks
to
have
a
technical
change
in
the
law
applied,
where
the
evidence
is
undisputed
that
he
knowingly
waived
his
right
to
the
assistance
of
counsel.
habeas
corpus
relief,
where
a
fundamentally
fair
trial
was
held
and
where
the
opportunity
to
litigate
this
issue
at
the
time
of
the
state
trial
was
available
to
him,
should
not
allow,
where
the
truth-finding
function
was
not
tainted,
to
allow
for
him
to
have
a
new
trial
on
these
particular
charges
without
the
admission
of
this
evidence
which
was
proper
under
the
law
in
1980.
in
our
second
argument,
we
would
submit
that
edwards
v.
arizona
is
factually
and
legally
distinguishable
from
butler's
case
because
butler
never
requested
the
assistance
of
counsel
during
any
of
his
interrogations
and,
unlike
edwards
and
roberson,
and
the
counsel
met
with
mr.
butler
prior
to
the
interrogation
that
was
done
on
this
particular
charge
that
resulted
in
the
conviction.
particularly,
we
have
noted
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
had
attached
on
the
assault
charges;
however,
he
never
requested
the
assistance
of
counsel
at
any
time
during
any
interrogation
which
was
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment.
the
critical
fact
is
that
butler
failed
to
request
his
assistance
during
any
interrogation,
and
that
counsel
was
made
available
to
him
for
purposes
of
the
bond
hearing
on
the
assault
charge,
where
there
was
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
consult
with
counsel.
the
concerns
of
the
fifth
amendment
right
to
have
counsel's
assistance
during
a
custodial
interrogation
were
satisfied,
as
we
have
asserted,
when
counsel
was
made
available
with
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
meet
with
him
during
that
time
period.
the
record
before
this
court
reveals
that
he
did
in
fact
meet
with
him
at
the
time
of
the
jail.
we
have
raised
a
final
issue
for
the
first
time
in
our
brief
before
this
court
concerning
a
state
court
bar.
it
was
asserted
the
edwards
claim--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--we
would
submit
it
would
have
been
necessary
to
give
the
miranda
warnings
on
the
separate
investigation
in
this
case,
since
he
did
have
counsel
at
that
particular
time
retained
on
the
assault
charge.
the
law
enforcement--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--under
the
sixth
amendment,
for
the
purposes
of
the
assault
charge,
to
assist
him
in
the
handling
of
the
assault
charge,
that
is
correct.
but
not
for
the
purposes
of
the
murder
charge
that
he
was
initially
charged
with
at
12:50
in
the
morning,
after
the
bond
hearing
had
already
been
held,
with
counsel
hill's
presence
at
that
particular
bond
hearing.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
the
record
does
not
reveal
that
he
was
already
a
suspect
on
the
murder
charge
at
that
particular
time.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
there
was
a
common
element
in
both
of
the
investigating
officers.
the
individual
that
interrogated
him
on
the
first
charge,
sergeant
frasier,
also
interrogated
him
on
the
murder
charge.
there
was
that
common
element
with
both
cases.
the
final
issue
we
have
raised
in
our
brief
before
this
court
for
the
first
time
is
that
there
is
a
state
procedural
bar
that
could
affect
the
outcome
of
this
particular
case.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
it's...
it's
unclear
to
me
why
we
didn't
make
it
before,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that
is
correct,
i
am...
i
am
familiar
with
that.
but
i
am
raising
it
in
this
particular
proceeding
to
give
that
information
to
the
court
that
there
was
a
state
bar.
we
are
not
totally
relying
upon
that,
but
what
it
does
evidence
is,
essentially--
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
--no,
sir,
we
do
not.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
we
may
very
well
be
barred.
i
thought
it
was
important
to
present
this
to
the
court,
to
give
them
an
understanding
as
to
the
way
the
edwards
v.
arizona
claim
had
been
raised
throughout
the
state
process.
because
up
until
the
time,
we
would
submit,
that
the
federal
district
court
made
the
decision
in
the
case,
which
did
not
find
an
edwards
violation,
that
was
the
first
time
that
any
court,
on
the
basis
of
this
particular
record,
had
ever
addressed
the
edwards
claim
on
the
merit.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
appeal
before
the
south
carolina
supreme
court,
so
there
was
no
state
law
conclusion
on
that.
the
first
time
it
was
raised
was
in
the
south
carolina
post-conviction
relief
court,
which
was
some
two
years
after
the
edwards
violation.
when
it
was
raised
there,
they
found
it
to
be
barred
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
they
chose
not
to
appeal
that,
it
was
not
raised
in
the
federal
habeas
corpus
petition,
as
raised...
presented
to
the
court,
and
it
was,
it
was
addressed
essentially
before
the
fourth
circuit,
and
we
did
not
raise
it
before
the
fourth
circuit,
and
we
did
not
raise
it
in
our
respondent's
opposition
to
certiorari.
we
recognize
this
court's
determination,
but
what
i
think
this
reflects
to
the
court
is
that
the
edwards
bar
and
the
arizona
v.
roberson
bar
that
presented
to
this
court,
are
not
that
clear
when
it
comes
to
the
presentation
of
this
issue
to
the
courts.
mr.
donald
john
zelenka
that
is
correct,
and
i
don't
dispute
this
court's
authority,
and
proper
authority,
to
do
that
particular
fact.
but
we...
what
we
are
asserting,
what
we
are
presenting
to
this
court,
is
merely
the
belief
that
this
supports
our
view
that
arizona
v.
roberson
was
in
fact
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
criminal
procedure
that
this
court
evidenced
in
its
decision
during
the
last
term.
and
that
supports
it
because
the
defendant
chose
not
to
assert
that
strongly
throughout
the
entire
court
process.
that
this
time,
that
is
the
only
reason
that
we
are
raising
that
particular
issue
before
this
court.
unless
this
court
has
any
further
questions
on
this
matter,
i
will
rest.
