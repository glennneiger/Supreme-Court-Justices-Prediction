mr.
john
h.
blume
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
arizona
v.
roberson
created
a
new
rule
of
law
for
retroactivity
purposes.
the
court
of
appeals
held,
with
five
judges
dissenting
from
the
denial
of
rehearing
en
banc,
that
although
the
facts
of
this
case
were
not
distinguishable
from
roberson,
that
roberson
was
not
applicable
because
it
was
not
the
law
at
the
time
of
mr.
butler's
trial
in
1980.
since
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
the
law
of
retroactivity
has
changed
somewhat.
in
teague
v.
lane,
this
court
held
that
new
rules
of
criminal
procedure
do
not
apply
to
cases
which
are
final
on
direct
review
at
the
time
the
new
rule
is
established.
however,
common
to
all
of
this
court's
retroactivity
decisions,
is
the
following
principle
which
is
dispositive
to
this
case:
when
a
decision
of
this
court
had
done
nothing
more
than
apply
subtle
precedent
to
a
different
fact
situation,
no
real
question
arises
as
to
retroactivity.
because
arizona
v.
roberson
was
nothing
more
than
a
straightforward
application
of
edwards
v.
arizona,
to
a
slightly
different
set
of
facts,
it
applies
retroactively.
the
first
place
to
look,
i
believe,
is
the,
this
court's
decision
in
roberson.
in
the
first
paragraph
of
the
majority
opinion,
the
court
stated
that
the
attorney
general
of
arizona
asked
us
to
craft
an
exception
to
the
rule
of
edwards
for
cases
in
which
the
police
wish
to
interrogate
an
individual
about
charges
which
are
unrelated
to
the
crime
for
which
the
person
initially
invoked
the
right
to
counsel.
this
court
rejected,
by
a
vote
of
six
to
two,
the
attorney
general's
proffer
distinction
of
edwards,
and
the
opinion
clearly
reveals
that
this
court
believed
that
roberson
was
directly
within
the
logical
compass
of
edwards.
thus,
as
was
true
in
yates
v.
aiken,
another
south
carolina
retroactivity
case
decided
by
this
court
two
terms
ago,
this
case
does
not
involve
a
new
rule
of
law.
mr.
john
h.
blume
the
hard
facts
of
teague,
of
course,
do
involve
a
situation
which
would
require
overruling,
and
the
language...
however,
of
course,
i
think
teague
must
go
beyond
that.
i
agree
with
justice
scalia,
with
you
to
that
extent.
however,
the
language
of
teague,
i
believe,
was
that
if
the
result
is
not
dictated
by
prior
precedent.
roberson
certainly
is
dictated
by
the
rule
of
edwards,
and
in
essence
what
the
state
of
arizona
asked
was
this
court
to
craft
an
exception
to
the
rule,
not
to
extend
the
rule,
but
to
create
an
exception,
and
this
court
declined
to
do
so.
i
think
if
this
court
determines
that
any
time
there
is
an
intellectually
tenable
distinction
of
one
of
your
cases,
that
the
resolution
and
rejection
of
that
distinction
creates
a
new
rule,
then
you
will
in
effect
be
skewing
the
constitutional
balance,
and
putting
a
premium
on
the
most
grudging
interpretation
of
everything
this
court
holds,
rather
than
a
more
faithful
interpretation.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
the
purpose
underlying
the
rule
is
does
the
state
have
a
legitimate,
essentially
reliance
interest,
in
expecting
that
the
decision
will
be
different.
if
the
definition
of
what
is
a
new
rule
is
drawn
too
narrowly,
then
essentially
the
states
will
have
an
incentive
to
offer
whatever
distinctions
they
have
of
any
case,
rather...
that
are
beyond
the
hard
facts
of
a
particular
holding,
rather
than
applying
the
decision
more
faithfully.
for
example,
edwards
contemplates
that
the
police
will
conduct
their
behavior
in
conformity
with
it.
if
they
don't,
then
we
expect
prosecutors
will
not
offer
those
confessions,
and
if
they
do
the
state
judges
won't
admit
them.
but,
if
any
time
a
distinction
is
rejected
that
creates
a
new
rule,
then
police,
prosecutors
and
state
judges
have
no
incentive
to
apply
this
court's
decisions.
rather,
prosecutors
will
offer
the
confession,
the
resulting
confession
and
any
distinctions
they
can
offer
in
support
of
that.
now,
those
distinctions
may
prevail
or
may
not
in
convincing
a
federal
judge
that
edwards
is
not
controlling.
but
nevertheless,
the
state
would
win
either
way,
for
the
rejection
of
the
distinction
would
itself
create
a
new
rule
and
would
deprive
that
person
and
everyone
within
that
temporal
cohort
of
the
benefit
of
the
rule.
and
that
essentially
is
the
attorney
general's
argument
here.
that
the
state
of
arizona...
that
the
arizona
attorney
general,
by
litigating
roberson
all
the
way
to
this
court,
and
losing
and
having
its
distinction
rejected,
should
deprive
everyone
between
edwards
and
roberson
of
the
benefit
of
edwards.
and
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
a
fair
interpretation
of
what
can
be
a
new
rule.
every
member
of
this
court
agreed
in
the
opinions
in
either
teague
or
in
penry
that
yates
v.
aiken
was
a
case
which
did
not
involve
a
new
rule.
yates
was
a
case
decided
two
terms
ago,
and
the
question
presented
in
yates
was
whether
francis
v.
franklin
created
a
new
rule,
or
rather
was
merely
an
application
of
sandstrom
v.
montana
to
a
different
set
of
facts.
this
case
is
very
similar.
just
as
francis
merely
applied
sandstrom,
roberson
merely
was
an
application
of
edwards.
thus,
because
roberson
and
edwards
are
distinct...
are
not
distinguishable,
and
because
roberson
was
within
the
logical
compass
of
edwards,
the
real
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
edwards
is
applicable.
because
mr.
butler's
case
was
on
direct
review
at
the
time
edwards
was
decided,
edwards
is
clearly
applicable,
roberson
is
clearly
applicable,
and
the
court
of
appeals
decision
was
wrong.
for
these
reasons,
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reversed.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
will
now
turn
the
podium
over
to
mr.
zelenka.
mr.
john
h.
blume
very
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
attorney
general
raised
several
merits,
arguments.
i
think
it
is
important
to
note
that
although
the
fourth
circuit
saw
no
distinction
between
this
case...
in
fact
saw
no
distinction
between
this
case
and
roberson,
the
attorney
general
did
not
cross-petition
on
the
merits,
and
therefore
i
don't
think
this
court
should
entertain
the
merits
of
the
case
now.
finally,
the
only
final
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
this
case
is
much
more--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--yes,
but
i
think
that
it's
discretionary
certainly
with
this
court
whether
it
entertain
the
merits.
i
think
under
circumstances
where
the
attorney
general
did
not
cross-petition
and
the
case
came
up
on
retroactivity,
that
the
proper
thing
to
do
would
be
to
reach
the
retroactivity
issue,
and
anything
else
should
be
left
to
the
lower
courts.
the
final
point
is
that
this
case
is
much
more
directly
within
the
line
of
edwards
than
even
roberson
itself.
while
roberson
involved
a
different
charge
and
different
police
officers,
this
case
involved
a
different
charge
but
the
same
police
officers.
so
some
of
the
concerns
in
the
dissent
in
roberson
are
not
present
here.
mr.
john
h.
blume
pardon
me?
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes.
i
was
just
making
the
point
that
this
is
much
more
directly
within
the
line
of
edwards
than
even
roberson.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
the
break
in
custody
would
again...
i
think
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
if
the
record
indicated,
for
example,
that
the
police
released
the
individual
to
avoid
edwards,
then
that
might
be
a...
certainly
a
dispositive
fact.
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
particular
case.
a
break
in
custody
could,
under
some
circumstances,
i
believe,
take
a
case
out
from
the
bright-line
rule.
mr.
john
h.
blume
on
an
individual
who
had
been
released?
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
it
would
depend,
again,
if
the
officers
did
it
to
avoid
edwards,
that
might
be
a
source
of
some
concern,
and
of
course,
that
is
not
what
happened
here.
mr.
john
h.
blume
on
different
charges?
mr.
john
h.
blume
edwards
does
seem
to
be,
and
roberson,
concerned
with
the
pressures
inherent
in
custodial,
inherent
in
custodial
interrogation,
and
thus
a
break
could
make
a
difference.
so,
yes,
i
think,
yes.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i...
that
situation
could
still,
i
think,
be
within
the
logical
compass
of
edwards
under
some
circumstances.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
of
course
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
you
can
say
that
the
states
had
any
right
to
rely
on
an
unarticulated
exception
to
edwards,
which
is
essentially
the
attorney
general's
position
in
this
case.
mr.
john
h.
blume
unarticulated,
not
articulated,
exception,
which
is
the
attorney
general's
argument.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes,
there
had
been.
i
don't
believe,
justice
white,
to
the
touchstone
for
whether
a
case
creates
a
new
rule
can
be
whether
there
was
a
division
of
authority
in
the
lower
courts.
the
same
was
true
in
the
perry
francis
situation.
a
number
of
courts
had
decided
that
mandatory
rebuttable
presumptions
did
not
violate
sandstrom.
nevertheless,
this
court
held
that
francis
v.
franklin
did
not
create
a
new
rule,
but
rather
was
an
application--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--i
don't
think,
of
course,
this
can
be
reduced
to
simple
arithmetic,
which
side
it
acted...
but
more
on,
i
think
you
would
have
to
look
behind
it
and
say
did
the
states
have
a
legitimate
reliance
interest
in
relying
on
it.
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
don't
think
it
should
be
disregarded,
but
i
don't
think
that
can
be
dispositive,
because
what
that
would--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--it's
a
factor,
yes,
i
believe
it
is
a
factor.
mr.
john
h.
blume
again,
i
think
that
question
is
answered
implicitly
in
yates.
francis
v.
franklin
was
a
five/four
decision
of
this
court.
everyone
agrees,
every
member
of
this
court
agrees
that...
had
agreed
that
francis
did
not
create
a
new
rule.
so
i
don't
think,
again,
whether
this
court
was
divided
five/four,
six/three,
or
whatever,
or
six/two,
as
in
roberson,
is
dispositive
of
whether
a
case
creates
a
new
rule.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes,
the
language
of
teague--
mr.
john
h.
blume
--was
dictated.
mr.
john
h.
blume
well,
teague
did
not
attempt
to
define
the
spectrum
of
what
is
or
is
not
a
new
rule.
it
gave
rather
general
guidance,
i
believe,
as
the
opinions
acknowledge.
both
teague
and
penry,
which
adopted
the
teague
standard
in
capital
cases...
of
course,
we
are
trying
to...
attempting
to
flesh
out
how
it
applies
in
this
case.
and
because,
essentially,
roberson
was
nothing
more
than
a
rejection
of
the
state's
purported
distinction
of
edwards,
that
can't
be
a
new
rule.
mr.
john
h.
blume
it
certainly
was
a
surprise
to
many
of
us.
[laughter]
mr.
john
h.
blume
i
think
it
has
some
statutory
and
some
constitutional
concerns,
depending
on
the
proceeding,
but
it
is
a
rule
which
this
court...
the
retroactivity
principle
of
this
court
to
determine
when
decisions
apply
to
cases,
final
and
direct
review.
mr.
john
h.
blume
yes,
i
think
that
is
true.
thank
you.
