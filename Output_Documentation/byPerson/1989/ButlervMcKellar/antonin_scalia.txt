justice

but
every...
every
decision
of
ours
is...
almost
every
decision
of
ours
is
within
the
logical
compass
of
another
decision.
i
mean,
we
could
have...
if
that
is
all
we
meant,
we
could
have
been
a
lot
clearer
in
teague,
and
we
could
have
just
said
that
it
doesn't
apply
retroactively
if
it
overrules
an
earlier
line
of
cases,
rather
than
just
following
the
logic
of
that
earlier
line.
we
didn't
say
that.
we
said
it
has
to
be
compelled
by
the
earlier
cases.
justice
scalia
what...
let's
consider
the
rationality,
the
reason
we
sought
to
draw
the
line.
the
reason
we
sought
to
draw
it,
i
thought,
was
that
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
main
purpose
of
habeas
is
to
make
sure
that
the
state
courts
are
behaving
lawfully
and
doing
their
best,
you
know,
to
follow
federal
precedent.
now,
you
think
they
are
behaving
unlawfully
whenever
they
would,
let's
say,
reject...
well,
let's
use
the
term
exception,
reject
a
perfectly
plausible
claim
for
an
exception
that
they
thought
we
might
accept.
would
that--
justice
scalia
you
shouldn't
be
so
surprised
at
that.
most
of
the
rules
that
govern
our
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
are...
are...
court...
court
created,
aren't
they?
i
mean,
the
whole
doctrine
of
when
it
is
allowable
and
when
it
isn't.
aren't
they
almost
all
judicially
constructed,
and
have
altered
considerably
over
the
years?
