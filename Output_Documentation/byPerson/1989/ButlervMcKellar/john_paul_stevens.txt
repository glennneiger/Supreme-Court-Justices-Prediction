justice
stevens
mr.
zelenka,
it
is
clear,
i
mean,
you
do
not
dispute
the
fact,
or
do
you,
that
this
interrogation
procedure
violated
the
rule
of
roberson,
if
roberson
had
been
in
effect.
justice
stevens
isn't
it
true
that
both
the
dissenting
judges
on
the
court
of
appeals
and
those
in
the
majority
all
assumed,
for
purposes
of
their
decision,
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
roberson
rule?
justice
stevens
did
you
in
that
court
that
this
rule
would
not
have
been
violated
in
any
event?
justice
stevens
you
did.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question
about
your
second
argument?
do
you
think
the
miranda
warnings
were
necessary
under
your
view,
if
he
had
already
had
counsel
tendered
to
him
and
never
requested
him,
i
suppose...
would
there
have
been...
would
it
have
been
necessary
to
give
the
miranda
warning?
justice
stevens
but
it
seemed
to
me...
i
thought
the
thrust
of
your
argument
was
that
since
he
already
had
a
lawyer,
that
satisfied
the
constitutional
obligation,
and
he
didn't
make
a
further
request.
justice
stevens
may
i
also
ask,
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
was
he
already
a
suspect
on
the...
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
on
the
unrelated
charge,
was
he
already
a
suspect
on
the
murder
charge?
justice
stevens
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
that.
it
was
the
same
group
of
officers
in
both
instances?
justice
stevens
it
is
true...
it
is
true
that
if
we
accepted
that
argument,
it
would
support
the
judgment
below,
would
it?
justice
stevens
[inaudible]
justice
stevens
do
you
think
teague
was
a
new
rule?
justice
stevens
what
is
it?
is
it
a...
what
was
it?
was
it
a
rule
of
statutory
construction?
what...
where
did
the
teague
rule
come
from?
what
kind
of
a
rule
is
it?
is
it
a
construction
of
a
statute
or
what,
the
teague
rule?
