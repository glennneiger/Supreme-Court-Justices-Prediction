chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
88-6677,
horace
butler
v.
kenneth
d.
mckellar.
mr.
blume.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
blume.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
zelenka.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
familiar
with
our
decision
in
tuttle
v.
oklahoma
city,
where
we
said
that
anything
that
might
prevent
us
from
getting
to
the
questions
presented
must
be
raised
in
the
opposition
to
certiorari
or
if,
as
long
as
it
is
not
jurisdictional,
be
deemed
waived?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
how,
if...
do
you
contend
this
would
be
jurisdictional?
that...
that
it
would
actually
prevent
us
from
reaching
the
questions
we
took
the
case
to
reach?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
why
are
you
not
barred
under
our
rule
in
the
city
of...
oklahoma
city
against
tuttle?
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
take
these
cases,
mr.
zelenka,
not
to
decide
the
facts
of
individual
cases,
where
there
was
or
was
a
violation
of
roberson
or
edwards,
but
to
decide
some
issue
of
more
general
importance,
such
as
whether
or
not
arizona
against
roberson
is...
is
to
be
given
effect
under
teague.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
zelenka.
mr.
blume,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
do
you
go...
how
do
you
go
about
answering
the
teague
question,
if
you
can't
take...
supposing
the
lower
courts
had
lined
up,
you
know,
ten
to
two
on
this
issue,
saying
that
edwards
did
not
extend
to
the
roberson
situation.
would
that
play
no
part
at
all
in
the
teague
analysis?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i'm
not
talking
about
state
law
enforcement
people.
i'm
talking
about,
you
know,
state
high
courts,
who
are
presumably
interpreting
claims
to
some
sort
of
a
roberson
doctrine
before
we
ever
got
there,
just
applying
edwards.
and
supposing
they
had
come
out
by
a
very
large
majority
saying
that
there
was
no
roberson
rule.
should
this
court
totally
disregard
that
sort
of
a
group
of
lower
court
decisions
in
applying
teague?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
it's
a
factor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
blume.
the
case
is
submitted.
