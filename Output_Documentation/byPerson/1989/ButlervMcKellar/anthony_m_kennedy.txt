justice
kennedy
was
the
defendant
in
custody
in
maine
v.
moulton?
justice
kennedy
he
was
in--
justice
kennedy
--he
was
in
custody
here.
justice
kennedy
well,
do
you
think
police
officers
reasonably
could
rely
on
the
fact
that
they
could
question
him
after
giving
him
miranda
warning?
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
well,
let
me
just
up
the
ante.
let's
assume
they
didn't
do
it
to
avoid
edwards.
they
just
have
new
information
and
a
new
charge.
could
they
interrogate
him
after
a
miranda
warning
and
a
waiver?
justice
kennedy
yes.
justice
kennedy
all
right.
now
suppose
we
ruled
that
a
break
didn't
make
a
difference.
would
that
be
retroactive?
would
it
be
barred
by
teague?
justice
kennedy
you
would
have
to
say
that,
it
seems
to
me,
consistently
with
the
argument
you
made.
and
that
puts
you
in
the
position
of
saying
that
where
the
police
reasonably
could
rely
on
the
earlier
state
of
the
law,
nevertheless,
teague
does
not
apply
to
their
conduct,
and
that
seems
to
me
completely
contrary
to
what
we
were
trying
to
accomplish
in
teague.
and
i
just
point
that
out
to
show
you
that
the
logical
compass
argument
that
you
make
is
too
universal
a
principle
for
the
decision
of
this
case.
