mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
by
taking
up
justice
white's
point
on
the
fees
accrued
in
litigating
the
fees,
because
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
what
this
statute
is
about.
congress
clearly
intended
to
make
fee
litigants
whole,
to
the
extent
that
they
could
under
this
statute,
by
awarding
them
their
fees
not
only
for
the
underlying
merits,
but
for
the
fees
in
litigating
the
fees.
not
to
do
so
would
undermine
the
purpose
of
the
act,
because
it
would
establish
an
economic
deterrent
that
this
court
noted
in
sullivan
v.
hudson
should
not
exist.
in
this
case,
and
our
case
here
i
think
amply
demonstrates
the
problem,
we
need
to
look
no
further
than
the
statute
itself.
the
statute
talks
about
substantial
justification
and
the
position
of
the
united
states
in
terms
of
the
government's
underlying
conduct,
as
well
as
their
litigation
position.
the
government
studiously
avoids
the
1985
amendments
to
this
act,
because
those
amendments
make
it
crystal
clear
that
the
government's
position
is
not
tenable
here.
in
our
case,
in
1981
the
government
engaged
in
activity
by
incarcerating
2,000
people,
and
then
not
publishing
a
regulation
that
their
own
counsel
advised
them
to
do
a
the
agency
level,
clearly
were
not
substantially
justified.
we
then
have
spent,
since
1982,
seven
years,
almost
eight
years
now,
litigating
solely
the
fee
issue.
congress
could
not
have
intended,
and
clearly
said
so
in
the
1985
amendment,
to
allow
us
fees
for
the
underlying
litigation,
but
then
allow
the
government
to--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
that's
correct,
but
the
government's
position
has
not
been
advanced
one
iota
since
that
litigation.
because
the
reality
is
that
the
haitians
were
released,
and
the
government
came
to
this
court,
and
in
your
honor's
opinion
you
noted
specifically
that
the
government
conceded
in
this
court,
and
the
dissent
noted
that
for
the
first
time
the
government
conceded
that--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--oh,
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
but
the
fee
litigation
did
begin
in
1982,
and
we
did
file
our
first
fee
petition
in
1982.
it
is
true
that
there
was
other
litigation
as
well,
but
they...
they
went
forward
simultaneously.
and
it
is
also
true,
and
the
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
that
that
other
litigation
would
not
have
been
necessary
if
the
government
had
made
the
concession
that
they
made
in
this
court,
which
is
that
their
regulations
and
statutes
were
neutral
and
nondiscriminatory.
the
government's
argument
also,
in
many
respects,
tortures
and
certainly
strains
the
language
of
this
act.
to
take
justice
kennedy's
point,
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
that
indicates
that
fees
should
be
separated
into
different
aspects
of
the
litigation.
the
statute
talks
of
fees
in
the
civil
action.
to
reach
the
government's
position
in
this
case,
this
court
would
have
to
amend
the
statute
not
once,
but
twice.
you
would
have
to
amend
it
to
say
that
fees
and
substantial
justification
are
determined
at
different
stages
of
the
litigation,
which
the
statute
does
not
say,
and
you
would
have
to
read
out,
as
the
government
does
in
their
brief,
the
question
of
substantial
justification
with
respect
to
the
government's
underlying
action.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
absolutely.
and
that
is
why
we
think
that
the
government's
concerns
here
are
purely
hypothetical.
the
government's
description
of
absolute
fee
shifting,
the
government's
description
that
they
would
have
to
pay
untold
fees,
is
completely
unreasonable
and
unrealistic.
what
we
are
saying
is
substantial
justification,
consistent
with
the
statute,
like
prevailing
party
in
hensley,
is
a
threshold
determination.
once
that
determination
is
made,
just
as
in
hensley,
then
it's
a
matter
of
the
district
court's
discretion
as
to
what
is
a
reasonable
fee.
and
on
the
facts
in
this
case,
for
example,
to
the
extent
that
the
government
won
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
to
the
extent
that
we
then
submit
other
applications
for
fees
for
those,
the
court...
the
district
court
judge
can
take
that
into
consideration
and
make
a
determination
that
we
are
not
entitled
for
x
number
of
dollars
for
pursuing
one
issue
that
the
government
won
on,
but
we
are
entitled
to
others.
what
we
are
saying
is
not
that
the
district
court
doesn't
have
broad
discretion,
because
i
think
that
was
the
point
of
the
statute,
but
that
the
government
shouldn't
be
allowed
to
come
in
and
allege
different
issues,
as
they
are
suggesting
here,
at
different
phases,
the
substantial
justification
threshold.
they
have
all
the
protection
they
need
under
a
hensley
rationale
with
respect
to
what
a
reasonable
fee
is.
and
the
statute
specifically
contemplates
that,
because
the
statute
says
in
the
appropriate
sections,
in
section
(1)(c)
and
in
section
(2)(a),
that
plaintiffs
are
entitled
to
a
reasonable
fee.
in
section
(1)(c),
to
the
degree
that
the
plaintiffs
are
unreasonable
in
prolonging
the
litigation,
at
whatever
phase
of
that
litigation
they
are
involved
in,
they
are
entitled
to
no
fee.
so
that
the
district
court
is
intended
to
be
that
party
to
make
these
decisions.
and
i
think
it
is
clear--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--under
hensley
rationale,
we
might
not
be
entitled
to
the
fees
for
the
appeal.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
and
we
might
not
be
entitled
to
the
fees
for
pursuing
that
issue.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
on
appeal,
and
in...
and
in
the
district
court
we
might
not
be
entitled
to
those.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
no,
your
honor.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
substantial
justification
is
a
threshold.
we
have
met
that,
because
you
look
at
the
agency's
underlying
action.
once
that
is
met--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--no.
then
the
determination
is
left
to
the
district
court
as
to
what
a
reasonable
fee
is.
within
the
rubric
of
a
reasonable
fee,
as
this
court
said
in
hensley,
they
can
take
into
consideration
whether
or
not
we
prevailed,
as
you
are
suggesting,
on
an
issue
or
not.
so
the
government's
worst
case
scenario
is
met
by
the
fact
that
the
district
court
judge,
or
if
he
is
reversed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
of
appeals
can
say,
under
hensley,
we
are
entitled
to
no
fees
at
all
for
pursuing
that
particular
issue.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
on
those
issues,
under
hensley,
under
a
reasonableness
test,
yes,
we
would
not
be
entitled
to
it.
and
i
think
that
is
what
really
meets
all
the
government's
concerns
here.
and
those
concerns
are
also
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
this
act.
and
i
think
the
clearest
example
of
that,
your
honors,
is
the
case
with
respect
to
litigating
the
fees.
the
average
case,
the
actual
case
that
comes
before
the
courts
is
where
a
fee
is
generated
of
only
$4,500.
the
government,
i
think,
as
justice
white
was
pointing
out,
the
government
can
then
litigate.
and
we
assume
the
government
in
many
instances
may
be
reasonable.
they
may
lose,
but
they
are
very
good
lawyers,
they
can
fashion
very
reasonable
arguments.
and
in
the
process
of
doing
that
they
can
run
up
enormous
fees,
far
beyond
the
average
fee
in
an
equal
access
to
justice
act
case.
and
that
fee
is
$4,500;
90
percent
of
the
fees
in
equal
access
to
justice
act
cases
are
less
than
$3,000.
so
if
the
government
has
an
interesting
issue,
as
they
did,
for
example,
in
sullivan
v.
hudson,
where
the
lawyer
as
a
matter
of
record
had
to
drop
out
of
the
case,
because
the
government
took
that
all
the
way
to
this
court,
where
the
government
has
an
interesting
issue
and
they
wish
to
pursue
it
all
the
way
to
the
supreme
court,
the
fee
litigant
is
going
to
be
discouraged
from
taking
those
kind
of
cases.
and
the
thought
of
congress
here
is
we
want
to
encourage
people
to
take
cases.
we
want
to
make
sure
that
they
don't
feel
that
there
is
a
tremendous
risk
that
down
the
road
the
government
will
litigate
against
them
for...
for
years
to
come,
as
they
have
in
this
case,
and...
and
wind
up
with
enormous
fees
that
the
party
cannot
pay.
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
no,
because
the
statute
says
that
it's
fees
in
the
civil
action.
and
the
government
concedes--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--okay.
well,
i
think
first
of
all
the
government
doesn't
take
that
position.
they
say
that--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--well,
they
take
the
position
that
the
fees
are
fees
in
the
civil
action.
so
to
the
degree
that
they
separate
out,
they
are
talking
about
only
separating
out
the
fees
for
litigating
the
fees.
they
are
not
talking
about
separating
out
the
fees
for
the
underlying
merits
of
the
case.
so
it's
not
clear
that
any
of
those
analogies--
mr.
ira
jay
kurzban
--well,
assuming
the
hypothetical,
and
obviously
we
don't
want
to
concede
that,
but
assuming
what
your
honor
is
saying
is
correct,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
no,
the
substantial
justification
threshold
would
not
apply,
because
it
would
defeat
the
very
purpose
of
the
act
for
the
very
reasons
that
you
have
suggested.
which
is
it
would
allow
the
government
to
litigate
issues
endlessly.
it
would
give
them
a
weapon
that
would
serve
as
an
economic
deterrent
for
litigation.
i...
i'd
like
to
address
just
one
more
point
in
closing,
which
is
the
russell
v.
heckler
point,
which
the
government
suggests
is
a
compromise
position.
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that,
as
the
government
concedes
that
that
position
is
not
well
grounded
in
the
statute
itself,
this
statute
is
absolutely
clear,
and
technical
defenses
and
russell
v.
heckler
types
of
defenses
are
just
inapplicable.
they
are
in
effect
an
attempt
to
amend
the
statute.
to
amend
the
statute,
number
one,
when
it
is
not
necessary,
because
hensley
and
the
reasonableness
test
address
all
those
issues.
but
secondly,
they
are
clearly
an
amendment
of
the
statute
because
they
allow
the
government
to
make
certain
litigation
arguments
separate
from
the
agency's
underlying
conduct.
and
the
court,
in
1985
in...
i
am
sorry,
the
congress
in
1985
indisputably
said
that
you
cannot
separate
those;
that
you
must
look
at
the
agency's
underlying
action;
and
that
you
can't
let
lawyers
come
into
court,
whether
it
is
a
technical
defense,
whether
it's
a
russell
v.
heckler
type
of
defense,
whether
it
is
any
other
kind
of
defense,
and
make
the
argument
that
because
their
litigation
position
is
reasonable,
that
that
is
sufficient.
thank
you.
