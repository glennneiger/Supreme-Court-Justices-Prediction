justice
kennedy
well,
what
is
there
in
the
statute
which
justifies
our
making
the
distinction
between
the
merits
stage
and
the
fee
stage?
you
have
mentioned
fee
stage
very
adroitly
now
six
times,
i've
noticed.
aren't
we
going
to
hear
that
there
is
no
basis
for
that
dichotomy?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
if
that
is
true,
counsel,
the
district
judge
was
also
reasonable
in
making
the
original
fee
award,
so
far
as
appeals
are
concerned.
