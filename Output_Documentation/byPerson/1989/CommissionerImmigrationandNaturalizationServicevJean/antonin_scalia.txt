justice
scalia
what
do
you
mean
could?
could
as
a
matter
of
law,
or...
or...
i
mean...
are
you
saying
we
could
adopt
a
different
legal
rule?
justice
scalia
or
are
you
saying
that
it's
up
to
the
discretion
of
the...
of
the
district
court
to
decide
whether
it
is
going
to
do
the
one
or
the
other?
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
mr.
larkin,
what
do
you
do
about
the
perpetual
motion
objection
that
is
made
here
by...
by
the
respondent?
justice
scalia
that
is
to
say
it
will
never
end.
i
mean,
if
you
get
the
fees
on
this
basis,
then
you
are
able
to
argue
again
that
whatever
fees
are
awarded
below
were
on
the
basis
of
a
reasonable
opposition
by
the
government.
how
does
it
ever
end?
justice
scalia
what
court
can
decide
that
all
at
once?
the
district
court?
justice
scalia
the
district
court.
justice
scalia
fine.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
well...
well...
but,
excuse
me.
but
the
court
of
appeals
looks
at
all
of
that,
but
there
is
also
the
question
of
the
fees
for
the
appeal.
right?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
oh,
there...
there
is
no
inquiry
as
to
whether
your
appeal
was
reasonable?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
they
could
find
against
you
even
though
you
were
reasonable.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
was
wrong.
justice
scalia
okay.
and
the
court
of
appeal
has...
has
an
obligation
to
decide
both
of
those
issues?
justice
scalia
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
doesn't
say
anything?
it
just...
just
says
you
are
wrong,
finds
against
you
on
the
appeal.
justice
scalia
before
the
district
court.
justice
scalia
mr.
larkin,
you
are
going
to
do
it
issue
by
issue?
i
mean,
that
sounds
like
a
pretty
reasonable
objection
that
you
described,
especially
since
you
won
on
it,
but
maybe
you
took
some
other
unreasonable...
while
you
were
at
it,
maybe
you
objected
unreasonably
to
some
other
of
the
elements
of
the
fee
award.
now,
would
the
time
spend
defending
the
unreasonable
objections
be
compensable?
in
other
words,
are
you
going
to
divide
up
the
whole
fee
appeal
into
its
various
issues?
justice
scalia
mr.
larkin,
when
you
are...
what
you
are
proposing
is
that
the
standard
where...
where
you
have
lost
on
the
merits,
but
you
assert
that
attorneys
fees
should
not
have
been
awarded
because
although
you
lost,
you
were
substantially
justified.
what
you
are
proposing
is
that
the
standard
that
be
applied
is
whether
you
were
substantially
justified
in
saying
that
you
were
substantially
justified.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
you
think
the
judicial
mind
can
entertain
this
concept?
[laughter]
justice
scalia
mr.
kurzban,
how,
what...
let's
take
the
government's
doomsday
case,
where...
where
you
come
in
with
a
fee
request
that
is
plainly
in
excess
of
the
statutory
limit,
and
there's
no
justification.
and
the
government
objects,
but
the
district
court
nonetheless
grants
it.
all
right?
and
then
that
is
reversed
on
appeal.
what...
what
fees
would
you
be
entitled
to?
justice
scalia
well--
justice
scalia
--on
appeal.
justice
scalia
but
then...
but
then
you
have
already
divided
the
litigation
into
two
pieces,
which
you
say
is
a
no-no.
justice
scalia
you
get
all
your
fees.
