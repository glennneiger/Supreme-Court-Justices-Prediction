justice
stevens
mr.
larkin,
can
i
interrupt
with
something
that
ran
through
my
mind?
supposing
you
have
a
case
in
which
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
the
liability
issues
and
the
remedy
issues,
and
you
have
two
separate
stages,
liability
and
remedy.
and
it
is
determined
that
your
position
on
liability
was
not
substantially
justified,
but
there
were
substantial
merit
to
your
objections
to
the
remedy.
would
you...
would
you
just
get
fees
for
the
liability
part
of
the
lawsuit?
justice
stevens
i
know
you
could
draw
the
line
either
of
the
ways.
what
is
your
position
on
the
question
of
differentiating
between
merits
and
remedy?
justice
stevens
if
cases
are--
justice
stevens
--but
i
still
don't
think
i
have
an
answer
to
my
rather
simple
question.
supposing
you
have
a
claim
for
social
security
benefit
or
something
like
that,
and
there
is
a
big
fight
about
liability,
and
on
that
position
the
judge
says
your
position
was
not
substantially
justified.
but
you
also
have
a
dispute
over
the
amount
of
benefits,
maybe
you
get
credit
for
past
months
or
you
don't...
you
often
get
that
kind
of
a
dispute.
and
on
that
issue
the
government's
position
was
substantially
justified.
does
the
plaintiff
get
fees
for
that
part
of
the
litigation?
justice
stevens
but
your
position
is
anything
that
is
severable
as
to
which
you
have
a
substantial...
substantially
justified
position,
no
fees
as
to
that
phase
of
the
litigation.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask--
--and
you
conceded,
i
take
it,
or
you
concede
in
your
brief
that
the
initial
work
that
the
prevailing
party
does
to
calculate
its
fees
and
to
make
its
motion
to
the
district
court
is
compensable.
justice
stevens
well,
if...
if...
if
you
say
that
there
are
these
discrete
stages,
how
does
your
concession
square
with
your
argument
that
there
are
discrete
stages?
justice
stevens
and
they
are
entitled
to
all
of
the
time
they
expend
reasonably
in
compiling
their
hours
and
making
their
fee
request.
i
didn't
know
you
conceded
that.
do
you?
justice
stevens
i
am
still
puzzled
about
this
bright
line,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
there
are
fee
requests
and
fee
requests.
some
are
rather
conclusory
and
some
are
very
detailed.
and
if
you
got
a
fee
request
that
was
very,
very
detailed,
took
many,
many
hours
to
get
it
together,
you
would
say
that
was
compensable.
but
if
they
send
in
one
that
just
kind
of
in
general
described
what
the
various
associates
had
done,
and
without...
and
you
thought
you
had
to
take
their
depositions
or
do
discovery
to
find
out
exactly
what
was
covered,
is
that
compensable
or
not,
responding
to
your
very
reasonable
inquiries
about
we
want
a
little
more
detail
here?
justice
stevens
so
what
you
do,
then,
you
spend
lots
and
lots
of
time
itemizing
and
documenting
so
you
are
sure
nobody
is
going
to
raise
any
questions
about
the
form
of
your
submission,
because
you
know
you
will
get
paid
for
that.
justice
stevens
without
the...
i
see.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question?
how
does
this
normally
work
in
the
district
court?
does
the
district
judge
combine
all
the
issues
in
one
hearing,
or
will
they
sometimes
decide
i'd
better
determine...
make
the
substantial
justification
determination
first
before
i
spend
a
lot
of
time
worrying
about
hours
and
rates,
or
do
they
do
it
all
at
once?
justice
stevens
because
it
would
seem
to
me
that
if
you
have
made
that
determination,
then
you
know
you
are
going
to
get
fees
and
you
would
pay
them.
but
if
you
haven't
made
that
determination,
there
may
be
a
lot
of
waste
time.
well,
anyway,
i
just--
justice
stevens
--well,
now
the
time
that
is
compensable
for
preparing
the
fee
request,
suppose
some
of
that
time
is
devoted
to
research
to
develop
the
argument
that
there
was
no
substantial
justification?
that's
part
of
your
presentation.
you
have
got
so
many
hours,
and
the
reason
it
wasn't...
i
mean,
your
fee
application
ought
to
cover
that
too.
is
that
time
compensable?
justice
stevens
so
a
lot
of
their
research
and
work
on
the
substantial
justification
issue
would
be
compensable
under
your
bright
line.
