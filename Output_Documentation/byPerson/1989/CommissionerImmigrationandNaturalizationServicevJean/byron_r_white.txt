justice
white
isn't
that
a
fee
on
a
fee
that
you
don't
want
to
pay?
justice
white
well,
why
isn't
it
a
fee
on
a
fee?
justice
white
well
then,
what
is,
what
is
wrong
with...
what
are
you
complaining
about
now?
[laughter]
justice
white
yes,
but--
justice
white
--but,
mr.
larkin--
justice
white
--well,
what
if
you...
what
if
you
challenged
the
number
of
hours
or
the
rate
that
is
to
be
applied,
and
the
district
court
thinks
your
position
is
substantially
justified,
but
just
plain
wrong?
now,
i
would...
under
your
concession
i
would
think
they
would
be
entitled
to
fees
for
that
time
and
effort
spent
against
your
position.
justice
white
but
you
don't
think
they
would
be
entitled
to
fees
for
defending
that
submission?
justice
white
what
if
they...
but
if
you
weren't
substantially
justified?
justice
white
just
like
any
other--
justice
white
--well,
what
about
you
challenge,
you
say
that
you
challenge
the
fee
because
you
think
on
the
merits
you
were
substantially
justified,
and
the
court
says
well,
you
were,
but
you
are
wrong.
justice
white
you
say
no
fee?
justice
white
no,
no.
i
see.
no
fee
at
all
then,
on
the
merits.
justice
white
well,
i
suppose
it
could
be
that
the
time
in
litigating
the
government's
objection
to
fees
on
the
ground
that
your
position
was
reasonably
justified,
it
could
be
that
the
time
litigating
that
might
exceed,
in
terms
of
attorneys
fees,
might
exceed
any
recovery
that--
justice
white
--well,
it
may
be,
but
i
suppose
if,
if
the...
suppose
there
weren't
any
recovery.
suppose
it
was
an
injunction
you
were
after.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
but
there
would
be
an
attorneys
fee.
justice
white
if
you
were
not
substantially
justified.
justice
white
and
if
they
are
not
entitled
to
fees
for
proving
that
you
were
not
substantially
justified,
why,
every
dollar
they
pay
their
attorney
for
that
litigation
comes
out
of
their
own
pocket.
justice
white
and
i
would
think...
don't
you
think
that
congress
had
some
idea
of
making
a
recovery...
rendering
the
plaintiff
cost
free
for
attorneys
fees
if
he
prevails
and
the
government's
position
was
untenable?
justice
white
no,
on
the
merits.
on
the
merits.
justice
white
but
not
at
the
time...
not
if
you
oppose
their
submission
and
say
that
you
were
substantially
justified,
and
then
thereafter
you
litigate
like
mad.
and
every...
and
you
say
no
money
for
that.
no
fee
for
that.
justice
white
and
so
every
dollar
they
pay
their
attorney
to
oppose
your
submission
is
out
of
their
pocket.
justice
white
no,
no.
for
the--
justice
white
--every
dollar
that
they
pay
their
attorney
reduces
in
effect
their
recovery
on
the
merits.
justice
white
don't
you
think
congress
had
some
idea
that
it
ought
to
be
cost
free
to
them?
justice
white
well,
if
the
government
then
says
well,
we
oppose
this
fee
request
because
we
think
the
hours
spent
were
excessive,
or
the
rate
requested
is
too
high,
and
the
district
court
agrees
with
them,
you're
not
entitled
to
fees
for
defending
your
submission?
justice
white
suppose
we
thought
that
there
was
something
to
the
government's
submission
that
fee
litigation
really
is
a
separate
lawsuit.
and
if
you
start
out
from
that
position,
doesn't
everything
the
government
has
submitted
here
follow?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
i
am
just
assuming
that...
i
guess
we
disagree
with
you
on
that,
that
fee
litigation
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
really,
involves
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
you
ought
to
construe
it
strictly.
and
suppose
we
say
this
is...
it's
just
like
filing
a
separate
lawsuit
against
the
government.
suppose
we
agree
with
the
government
to
that
extent.
justice
white
i
believe
they
just
said
it
right
here
in
court.
justice
white
well,
i
agree.
i
agree,
but
we
are
talking
about
whether
there
are
fees
on
fees.
and
if
this
is
a
separate
action
for
fees,
then
the
question
becomes
whether
you
are
entitled
to
fees
during
that
litigation.
