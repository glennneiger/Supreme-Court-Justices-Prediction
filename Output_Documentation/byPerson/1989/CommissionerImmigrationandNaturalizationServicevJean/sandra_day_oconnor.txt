justice
o'connor
mr.
kurzban,
under
your
view
of
the
statute,
do
you
nonetheless
concede
that
under
hensley
the
district
court
has
considerable
discretion
about
allowing
fees
at
all,
for
instance
for
losing
claims,
if
several
claims
are
made?
justice
o'connor
and
also,
discretion
to
determine
what
is
reasonable
for
attorneys
fees,
and
perhaps
to
adjust
within
that
category.
