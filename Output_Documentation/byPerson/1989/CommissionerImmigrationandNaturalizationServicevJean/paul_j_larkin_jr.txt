mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
equal
access
to
justice
act
generally
requires
the
united
states
to
pay
reasonable
attorneys
fees
to
a
prevailing
party
in
a
non-tort
civil
action
if
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
not
substantially
justified.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
substantial
justification
component
of
that
statute
applies
at
the
fee
stage
of
litigation,
the
so-called
fees
for
fees
question.
for
three
reasons
we
believe
that
it
does.
first,
the
fee
stage
of
the
case
is
part
of
the
overall
civil
action.
indeed,
if
the
fee
stage
of
a
case
were
not
part
of
the
civil
action,
then
a
prevailing
party
could
not
recover
attorneys
fees
for
that
phase
of
a
lawsuit
at
all.
second,
congress
limited
the
liability
of
the
united
states
for
attorneys
fees
to
those
instances
where
the
position
of
the
united
states
was
not
substantially
justified.
nothing
in
the
text
of
the
statute
renders
the
united
states
automatically
liable
for
attorneys
fees
at
any
stage
of
the
lawsuit,
at
the
merits
or
at
the
fee
stage.
and
third,
the
best
reading
of
the
text
of
the
act,
and
the
one
that
best
serves
its
purposes,
is
that
the
substantial
justification
requirement
applies
at
the
fee
stage
of
a
lawsuit.
the
fee
stage
and
the
merit
stage
are
conceptually
distinct,
the
legal
issues
involved
are
quite
different,
and
the
united
states
can
and
often
does
take
different
positions
in
fact
and
law
at
each
stage
of
a
lawsuit.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
is
that
point
where
the
parties
really
disagree,
and
it
is
that
point
that
i
was
about
to
address
right
now.
let
me
do
so.
and
let's
start
with
the
text
of
the
statute.
and
when
you
look
at
the
statute
we
think
you
first
have
to
look
at
the
forest
and
not
just
the
trees.
the
reason
is
the
very
existence
of
an
attorneys
fees
statute
is
significant.
it
modifies
the
american
rule;
it's
a
partial
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
what
a
fee
statute
does
is
create
a
new
cause
of
action
for
a
plaintiff
and
impose
a
new
form
of
financial
liability
on
the
united
states.
in
fact,
the
version
of
section
2412
of
the
judicial
code
that
existed
before
the
eaja
was
adopted
expressly
exempted
attorneys
fees
from
the
costs
that
could
be
awarded
against
the
united
states
in
a
lawsuit.
the
statute
itself,
therefore,
creates
an
entirely
new
claim
that
is
separate
from
the
dispute
on
the
merits.
now
that
is
not,
we
think,
a
novel
proposition.
this
court's
cases,
beginning
with
its
1982
decision
in
white
v.
new
hampshire
department
of
employment
security,
have
recognized
that
the
fee
stage
of
a
lawsuit
involves
different
issues,
and
is--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
that
is
one
way
to
break
the
statute
down.
it
would
be
to
decide
that
the
merits
and...
excuse
me,
the
liability
and
relief
stages
are
discrete.
and
if
the
united
states
was
not
substantially
justified
at
one
stage
but
was
at
the
other,
then
a
party
would
get
attorneys
fees
only
for
that
stage
where
the
united
states
was
not
substantially
justified.
there
is
an
even
simpler
way
to
break
down
the
statute
if
you
wanted
to.
what
you
could...
if
you
look
to
the
statute
it
requires
a
party
to
file
a
fee
request
within
30
days
of
the
entry
of
a
final
non-appealable
judgment.
you
could
draw
the
first
line
right
there.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
in
most
cases
there
are
not
going
to
be
a
difference.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
one...
there
is...
there
will
be
a
category
of
cases
where
there
is
a
difference,
and
that
is
this
category.
if
a
lawsuit
ends
in
a
settlement...
and
the
statute
uses
that
term
to
describe
when
a
lawsuit
ends,
so
it
contemplates
that
a
lawsuit
can
end
in
a
settlement.
the
settlement
may
be
a
consent
decree.
the
consent
decree
may
contemplate
that
there
is
future
litigation
down
the
road
over
questions
such
as
whether
the
united
states
lived
up
to
its
obligations
under
the
decree,
whether
the
decree
should
be
modified
or
whether
the
decree
should
be
entirely
vacated.
in
that
sort
of
circumstance
you
have
a
relief
part
of
the
action,
if
you
will,
that
extends
well
into
the
future.
generally
we
think
you
can
collapse
the
two,
because
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
what
a
person
is
going
to
be
claiming
is,
for
example,
an
entitlement
to
benefits
that
were
wrongfully
withheld.
when
the
united
states
pays
over
those
benefits,
that's
the
end
of
the
case
as
far
as
what
that
party
was
trying
to
get.
where
you
have
a
lawsuit
that
is
going
to
extend
into
the
future,
for
example
in
a
prisoners
lawsuit
where
he
claims
that
the
law
library
at
a
federal
prison
was
not
adequate
and
a
consent
decree
is
entered,
you
are
going
to
have
then
litigation
extending
into
the
future.
and
we
think
in
that
case
you
would
have
perhaps
three
lines,
not...
not
the
two.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
we...
we
think
that
if
we
were
substantially
justified
in
that
sort
of
circumstance
on
the
remedial
stage,
you
wouldn't
get
fees
for
that
part.
but
if
the
court
found
that
that
was
too
complicated
and
the
court
wanted
to
collapse
the
two--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes.
but
if
the
court
found
that...
like
i
say,
if
the
court
found
that
that
was
too
complicated,
it
could
collapse
the
two
into
one,
draw
the
first
line
once
the
final
non-appealable
judgment
is
entered,
and
consider
everything
up
to
that
point.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes.
because--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--the
former.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
legal
rule
would...
in
that
case
would
rest
and
give
primary
emphasis
to
that
portion
of
the
statute
which
says
the
fee
request
has
to
be
made
once
the
final
non-appealable
judgment
is
entered.
that's
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
that
is
a
legal
rule.
it
wouldn't
simply
leave
it
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
court.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
hensley,
as
we
explained
in
our
opening
brief,
would
be
authority
for
looking
at
the
statute
that
way.
the
prevailing
party
inquiry
that
is
made
under
hensley
is
the
one
that
is
normally
made
under
most
fee
statutes.
this
statute
is
unique.
it
also
adds
not
only
a
prevailing
party...
not
just
a
prevailing
party
inquiry,
but
it
has
a
substantial
justification
inquiry.
and
we
think
the
statute
can
logically
be
read
so
that
the
two
should
be
made
virtually
simultaneously.
you
can
apply
the
two
to
the
same
stages
of
a
lawsuit,
and
therefore
you
could
decide
whether
someone
prevailed
at
a
particular
phase,
and
even
if
they
did,
whether
we
were
nonetheless
taking
a
reasonable
position
at
that
stage,
either
the
agency
or
the
united
states
in
court.
and
specific
provisions
of
the
act
we
think
also
show
that
the
attorneys
fee
stage
is
clearly
a
separate
stage
of
the
lawsuit.
before
a
court
can
award
attorneys
fees
it
has
to
make
an
inquiry
into
a
variety
of
different
issues
that
arise
only
at
that
stage.
those
questions
typically
involve
the
inquiry
whether
or
not
a
party
was
a
prevailing
party,
whether
that
claimant
is
eligible
for
a
fee
award,
whether
the
number
of
hours
that
were
spent
on
the
case
were
adequately
documented
and
are
otherwise
reasonable
and
whether
there
is
present
in
the
case
a
special
factor
justifying
an
award
of
fees
in
excess
of
the
fee
cap,
which,
due
to
inflation,
is
now
about
$100
an
hour.
even
if
the
only
inquiry
that
the
court
makes
at
the
fee
stage
is
whether
the
position
of
the
united
states
was
substantially
justified,
that
inquiry,
too,
is
distinct
from
the
one
that
is
made
at
the
merits.
as
the
court
held
in
the
pierce
v.
underwood
case,
the
question
at
the
merits
is
whether
the
government
was
correct,
while
the
question
under
eaja
at
the
fee
stage
is
whether
the
government's
position,
although
incorrect,
was
nonetheless
reasonable.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--your
honor,
my
answer
to
that
is
a
practical
one.
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
a
court
is
going
to
be
able
to
decide
all
of
those
inquiries
at
one
time.
it
will
be
able
to
decide
whether
a
plaintiff
was
a
prevailing
party,
whether
the
united
states
was
substantially
justified,
if
not,
whether
the
inquiry
into
the
hours
and
fees
should
be
done
and
whether
the
fees
requested
are
reasonable,
and
whether
the
position
the
united
states
took
at
the
fee
stage
was
also
reasonable.
now,
that
problem--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--the
district
court.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
in
a
lawsuit
that
begins
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
can
make
that
inquiry.
it
can
make
each
of
those,
and
it
can
then
lay
those
out,
whatever
determinations
it
makes--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--for
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
the
court
of
appeals
will
then
be
able
to
look
at
all
of
those
at
one
time.
and
that,
i
think,
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
is
what
is
going
to
happen.
even
in
the
circuits
that
object--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--if...
if
the
court
of
appeals
goes
through
all
of
those
inquiries
and
rules
against
us
on
every
one--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--what
is
left
at
that
point
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
they
spent
a
reasonable
number
of
hours
on
the
appeal.
and
that,
we
think,
is
going
to
be
a
very
small
matter.
because
if
you
assume
that
the
parties
are
acting
in
good
faith,
the
only
inquiry
at
that
point
a
court
has
to
make
is
whether
or
not
they
spent
a
reasonable
number
of
hours.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
if
the
court
of
appeals
concluded--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
that's
right.
i'm
saying
if
the
court
of
appeals
concluded,
in
a
case
where
we
took
an
appeal--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that
our
position--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--was
wrong,
and
we
were
unreasonable
in
taking
the
appeal,
then
the
other
side
would
be
entitled
to
fees
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
question
would
just
be
a
reasonable
number
of
hours.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
if
the...
if
the
court
of
appeals
rules
against
us
and
says
they
are
eligible
for
fees,
the
court
of
appeals
can
then
ask
the
parties
to
submit
the
number
of
hours
they
reasonably
spent
on
the
appeal.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
then
the
other
party
is
certainly
going
to
file
a
request.
and
so--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
or
before
the
court
of
appeals.
we
think
before
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
the
more
natural
way
to
do
it.
because,
for
example
in
the
seventh
circuit
case
that
rejected
the
automatic
rule,
that
was
a
case
where
the
decision
was
from
the
nlrb
to
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
there
was
no
district
court
in
that
context.
the
request
went
back
to
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
to
make
this
sort
of
inquiry.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
there
rejected
the
automatic
rule
and
found
that
we
were
substantially
justified
in
taking
the
position
that
we
did.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
the
narrow
question
that
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
in
this
case
really
just
dealt
with
the
fees
in
the
district
court,
because
there
haven't
been
any
calculation
yet
or
anything
made
to
fees
on
appeal.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
that
was
the
holding
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
we
thought
that
that
was
a
reasonable
approach
to
the
statute--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
that...
that
serves
as
the
bridge
from
the
merits
to
the
fee
stage.
if
we
are
not
substantially
justified
in
the
merits,
then
they
are
entitled
to
an
award
of
attorneys
fees
for
the
merits.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
what
we
said
was--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
no.
it
is
not
a
fee
for
the
litigation
at
the
fee
stage.
it
is
just
a
reasonable
amount
of
hours
that
someone
spends
putting
the
fee
request
together.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
if
they
are
entitled
to
fees
on
the
merits,
we
thought
that
that
was
best
seen
as
part
of
the
merits.
now
maybe
we
were
wrong.
i
mean,
we
conceded
it,
but
it
is
not
a
question
of
fact,
it
is
a
question
of
law.
and
if
you
think
we
were
wrong,
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--what
we're
complaining
about
is
this.
when
the
united
states
receives
a
fee
request
you
have
to
take
a
position
on
that
request.
and
any
further
litigation,
we
think,
from
that
point
on,
if
we
are
reasonable
in
the
positions
we
take,
should
not
be
paid
entirely
by
the
government
for
both
sides.
now,
oftentimes
if
the
request
is
reasonable
the
government
wouldn't
oppose
it,
and
there
wouldn't
be
any
fee
litigation.
but
it
is
our
position
that
if
there
is
litigation
over
the
amount
of
fees
someone
claims,
that
that
is
litigation
at
a
divisible,
discrete
and
separate
portion
of
the
lawsuit,
and
the
substantial
justification
requirement--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--has
to
apply,
because
it's
the
only
requirement
that
there
is
in
the
statute,
and
because
the
congress
required...
limited
the
waiver
of
its
sovereign
immunity
to
situations
where
we
were
not
substantially
justified.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
we
don't
think
there
should
be
an
exception,
in
other
words,
just
for
fee
litigation.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
no.
what
the
concession,
let
me
explain,
and
perhaps
maybe
we
made
it
too
readily,
was
that
a
reasonable
number
of
hours
spent
preparing
the
fee
request
would
be
compensable
because
it
is
part
of
their
case
on
the
merits.
it
is
really
a
bridge
between
the
merits
and
the
fees--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--if
we
are
substantially
justified,
they
are
not
entitled
to
fees
for
defending
that
submission.
that
is
our
position.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
then
they
are.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that's
right.
the
reason
is
congress
chose
that
approach
because--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--then
they--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--then
they
don't
get
a
fee
at
all.
if
we
were
substantially
justified
on
the
merits,
then--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that's
right.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
if...
if...
that
would
not
be.
particularly
if
you
have
an
outstanding
rule
of
law
that
says
you
have
to
itemize
and
adequately
document
your
request
for
fees.
suppose
the
rule
in
the
circuit
is--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
if...
and
if
that
is
what
happens,
then
that
should
simplify
the
litigation
over
this
matter.
if
the
rule
in
the
circuit
is
you
have
to
with
specificity
itemize
and
document
your
requests,
then
a
party
who
follows
that
rule
will
simplify
matters
for
the
district
court.
if
the
rule
in
the
court
is
you
can't
just
submit
a
request
that
the
lawyers
in
my
firm
spent
100
hours
on
this
case--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--then,
if
they...
if
they
do
that,
then
we
are
reasonable,
because
they
are
not
following
the
law
in
that
circuit.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
whether
there
is
any
uniform
rule
on
that.
it
may
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
case
involved
primarily
a
legal
issue--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--it's
possible.
and
if
a
court
thinks
that
there's
going
to
be
time
wasted,
then
it...
a
district
court,
which
is
certainly
interested
in
processing
its
cases
efficiently,
will
be
able
to
do
so
in
that
type
of
manner.
if
the
substantial
justification
question
is
a
question
of
law
that
can
be
examined
by
looking
at
a
statute
or
some
other
cases,
the
district
court
might
believe
that
is
the
way...
the
best
way
to
start
out.
once
i
have
made
that
inquiry,
that
may
end
it.
the
court
may
also
say
but
to
be
safe
i
may
also
want
to
look
at
some
of
the
other
objections
in
order
to
avoid
having
to
do
this
again.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that
would
be,
under
the
way
we've
looked
at
the
statute.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
they
only
have
30
days
to
do
it,
so
it
is
not
as
if
someone
can
prepare,
you
know,
the
same
way
that
you
can
for
litigation
on
the
merits.
and
perhaps
if
they
spend
that
time
at
the
outset
that
may
reduce
the
need
for
litigation
further
down
the
road.
but
if
they
decide
to
present
a
novel
claim,
and
we
had
some
in
this
case.
the
award
in
this
case
of
attorneys
fees
was
$1.2
million.
it
is
one
of
the
largest
attorney
fee
awards
that
was
ever
handed
down
under
eaja.
and
the
district
court
gave
respondents
a
15
percent
enhancement
above
their
hourly
rates,
which
in
some
cases
were
already
above
the
cap
set
by
the
statute,
because
of
factors
such
as
the
emotional
hardship
suffered
by
respondents'
counsel.
not
by
respondents,
but
by
respondents'
counsel.
now,
we
thought
we
had
a
reasonable
objection
to
an
enhancement
on
a
basis
like
that.
and
it
was
our...
and
matter
of
fact,
not
only
did
we
think
we
were
reasonable,
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
us.
so
it
is
our
view
that
the
congress
did
not
intend
to
chill
the
government
from
taking
those
sorts
of
positions.
i
mean,
the
reason
that
it
adopted
the
statute
the
way
it
did
was
to
serve
two
masters.
it
wanted
on
the
one
hand
private
parties
to
be
able
to
vindicate
their
rights
in
court,
and
on
the
other
hand
to
ensure
that
it
wouldn't
chill
legitimate
exercise
of
government
enforcement
responsibility.
well,
one
of
the
responsibilities
the
government
has
is
a
fiduciary
duty
to
the
agency
involved,
from
whose
budgetary
appropriations
eaja
awards
are
made--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--you
could.
there
are
two
ways
of
doing
it.
that
would
be
one
way,
which
is
consistent
with
what
the
chief
justice
mentioned
is
the
prevailing
party
approach
under
hensley.
i
mean,
if
they
don't
prevail
on
an
issue,
they
shouldn't
be
entitled
to
fees
for
litigating
that
issue
at
all.
and
you
could,
therefore,
break
it
up
that
way.
another
way
to
do
it
is...
would
rely
on
the
sort
of
substantial
justification
in
the
main
approach
that
your
honor
wrote
about
in
the
underwood
case.
what
you
would
do
is
look
to
the
issues
where
we
lost
overall
and
see
whether
we
nonetheless
overall
had
a
reasonable
position.
now
that...
how
you
conduct
that
inquiry
is
not
before
the
court
in
this
case,
and
the
lower
courts
really
haven't
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
discussing
it.
all
you
have
to
decide
here
is
that
we
are
allowed
to
make
an
argument
that
we
were
substantially
justified,
that
we
were
reasonable
at
the
fee
stage.
how
you
want
to
break
it
down
doesn't
have
to
be
decided
here,
but
there
are,
as
i
said,
those
two
approaches.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
an
unusual
case
for
that
to
happen.
perhaps
in
a
case
like
this--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
it...
there
wouldn't
be
any
dollar
award
in
that
case
to
a
party.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
but--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--there
would
be
an
attorneys
fee.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
if
we
were
not
substantially
justified
at
the
merits,
then
we
have
to
pay
their
attorneys
fees
for
the
merits.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
they
are
entitled
to--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--well,
if
our
position
at
the
fee
stage
is,
as
you
put
it,
untenable--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--oh,
well,
if
our
position
on
the
merits
was
untenable,
then
they
will
get
an
award
of
fees
for
the
time
they
spent
to
vindicate
their
rights
at
the
merit
stage.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
correct.
at
the
fee
stage.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
for
the
fee
litigation,
yes.
but
we
are
not
saying
that
if
we--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--for
the
merits?
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
that...
that's
correct.
but
that
is,
we
think,
the
con--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
this
statute
is
unique.
in
the
other
statutes,
like
1988,
like
title
vii,
in
the
other
attorneys
fees
statutes,
you
don't
have
a
substantial
justification
requirement.
here
you
do.
that
makes
this
statute
different,
and
we
think
that
is
why,
in
this
type
of
context,
you
should
have
that
type
of
rule.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
and
that
can--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes.
it's
like
saying...
it
is
the
same
as
the
inquiry
now
a
court
has
to
do,
in
a
way,
as
to
whether
we
were
substantially
justified,
where
we
lost
under
the
apa,
and
the
apa
standard
is
whether
we
were
arbitrary
and
capricious.
but
let
me
give
you
an
example.
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
rules
against
us
on
the
substantial
justification
issue
by
a
two
to
one
vote.
it
seems
to
me
that
our
position
that
we
were
reasonable
is
evidenced
by
the
fact
that
one
of
the
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals
voted
for
us.
but
this
whole
type
of
inquiry
that
you
mention
is
not,
i
think,
going
to
happen
that
often.
what
is
going
to
happen
more
often--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--i
am
not
saying
you
can
just
tally
up
the
numbers
on
each
side,
but
what
i
am
trying
to
do
is
give
you
an
example
of
how
that
can
occur.
but
i
think
it
is
more
important
to
keep
in
mind
cases
where
someone
asks
for
award
in
excess
of
the
statutory
cap.
the
problem
you
mentioned
won't
happen
there.
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
and
i
will
make
only
two
points.
first,
the
'85
amendment
doesn't
undermine
in
any
way
our
interpretation
of
the
statute.
congress
addressed
a
problem
in
'85
dealing
with
the
front
end
of
litigation.
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
problem
that
arises
at
the
back
end.
there
is
no
logical
reason
to
assume
that
congress
wanted
the
same
answer
to
apply
in
both
circumstances
where
there
are
different
problems.
and
if
anything,
the
1985
amendment
actually
helps
us
in
a
way,
because
it
indicates
that
there
are
two
positions
that
have
to
be
considered:
the
agency's
and
the
lawyer's
position
that
is
taken
in
court.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
just
that
we
think
the
statute
has
to
be
read
so
that
the
substantial
justification
provision
and
the
civil
action
have
to
be
read
reasonably,
because
the
statute
uses
them
in
the
same
sentence.
if
the
fee
stage
is
not
part
of
the
civil
action,
then
they
don't
get
fees
for
fees
at
all.
if
the
fee
stage
is
part
of
the
civil
action,
then
the
substantial
justification
provision
has
to
apply.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
i
have
nothing
further
to
add.
