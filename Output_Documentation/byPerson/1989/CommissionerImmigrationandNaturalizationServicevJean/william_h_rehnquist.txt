chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
89-601,
the
commissioner
of
the...
immigration
and
naturalization
service
v.
marie
lucie
jean.
mr.
larkin.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
would
think
hensley
would...
the
hensley
case
would
support
some
sort
of
distinction
whether
or
not
you
make
a
formal
break
down
between
two
sections
of
the
case.
doesn't
hensley
say
that
the
fee
award,
even
to
a
prevailing
party,
has
to
be
tied
to
the
parts
of
the
case
in
which
the
prevailing
party
actually
won?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
there
any
question
involved
here
of
fees
on
appeal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
we
are
talking
about
fees
for
fee
litigation
in
the
district
court
for
work
done
in
the
district
court.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
larkin.
mr.
kurzban.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
kurzban,
wasn't
our
decision
in
commissioner
against
jean
several
years
ago,
wasn't
that
part
of
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
wasn't
fee
litigation,
was
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the
merits
have
also
been
litigated
during
this
period
of
time.
chief
justice
rehnquist
just
a
minute,
mr.
kurzban.
the
reason
i
asked
you
the
question
was
because
i
got
the
impression
from
what
you've
said
that
all
the
litigation
in
this
case
since
1981
had
been
over
fees.
and
i
thought
that
was
a
mistaken
impression.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kurzban.
mr.
larkin,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
the
case
is
submitted.
