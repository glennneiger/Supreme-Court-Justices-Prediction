justice
scalia
and
not
earning
benefits
under
any
new
plan.
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
yeah,
but
you
don't
pay
them
anything
because
they
didn't
have
a
vested
benefit
and
they
haven't
retired
yet.
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
when
they
do--
justice
scalia
--i
see.
justice
scalia
when...
when
you
say
that
the
pbgc
pays
vested
benefits,
you
don't
necessarily
mean
up
to
the
full
amount
of
the
vested
benefit?
you
still
mean
subject
to
whatever
limitations
there
are,
or
are
there
no
limitations
on
the
vested
benefits?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
nothing--
justice
scalia
--nothing
vests
but
what
pbgc
would
cover,
by
and
large?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
okay.
and
what
you
just
described
to
justice
stevens
as
being
the
consequence
is
only
the
consequence
because
of
the
particular
deal
struck
by
the
union
with
the
corporation
here.
conceivably,
the
union
could
have
said,
listen
people
that
are
already
retired,
tough
luck,
we'll...
we'll
let
them
just
get
what...
what
the
pension
benefit
corporation
pays
them.
but
for
workers
who
are
currently
working,
we'll
supplement
their
salaries.
it
could
be
done
that
way.
justice
scalia
but
in
this
case
it
was
both,
both
the
people
already
retired
and
the
ones
that
continued
to
work?
justice
scalia
ms.
flowe,
do...
do...
do
i
under
your
position
correctly
to
be
that
it
really
doesn't
matter
about
the
tax
waiver
and
it
doesn't
matter
how
these
matters
would
be
treated
in
the
bankruptcy,
even
assuming
the
worst,
that
these
plans
would
still
have
had
enough
funds
in
them
for
a
couple
of
years
to
continue
in
existence?
is
that...
is
that
true?
justice
scalia
you
started
off
earlier
by
saying
there
were
two
reasons
why
the
agency
restored
and
you
have
been
discussing
the
first,
and
the
second
one
was
the
change
in
the
financial
situation.
were
those
two
reasons
independent
or...
or
where
they
alternative...
or...
or
cumulative?
justice
scalia
oh,
it
may
be.
i'm
not
asking
whether
it
may
be
sufficient
in
and
of
itself.
i'm
saying
did
the
agency
express
that
to
be
an
independent
ground
or...
or
was
it
the
combination
of
the
two?
justice
scalia
maybe...
maybe
the
members
of
the
legislature
didn't
want
to
vote
for
that
in
particular
but
they
were
perfectly
content
to
vote
to...
to
let
the
agency
use
its
judgment,
as
the
text
of
the
act
seems--
justice
scalia
--they
did
vote
when...
when
it
was
enacted.
justice
scalia
but
none
of
this
was
literally
impaired.
you...
you
were
entitled
to
adhere
to
the
provisions
of
the
contract
that
you
had
negotiated
to.
the
only
thing
is
who
is
going
to
pay
for
the
whole
thing?
this
agency
didn't
prevent
you
from
negotiating
a
contract,
is
not
preventing
you
from
abiding
by
the
contract.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
fund
is
going
to
foot
the
bill.
that's
all.
justice
scalia
wouldn't
that
be
financial
improvement?
i
don't
understand
that.
what
other
factors
could
be
financial
improvement
other
than
financial
improvement?
justice
scalia
i'm
trying
to,
and
i--
justice
scalia
--i
think
another
factor
means
a
factor
other
than
financial
improvement.
justice
scalia
financial
turnaround.
justice
scalia
mr.
kaden,
the...
the
argument
you
were
just
making
assumes
that...
that
the
agency
is
saying...
maybe
they
picked
the
wrong
word
by
calling
it
an
abusive
follow-on
plan.
but
i
don't
think
they're
saying
that
it's
illegal,
that
it's
something
they
could
into...
into--
justice
scalia
--district
court
to
prevent
any
more
than
they
could...
any
more
than
they
would
say
that
a
financial
turnaround
is
illegal.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
it's
perfectly
lawful--
justice
scalia
--but
it's...
the...
the
issue
isn't
whether
its
illegal
but
whether
it
is
a
valid
reason
for
the
agency
to
terminate
the
plan
or
to--
justice
scalia
--yeah.
justice
scalia
well,
just...
just
strike
the
adjective
abusive.
i
mean,
the
follow-on
plan...
i
mean,
i
think
what
they're
saying
is
that
the...
they
don't
view
the
object
of
this
statute
to
be
to
put
onto
the
fund
the
obligation
of...
of
assisting
a
corporation
by
paying
85
percent
of
its
pension
benefits.
justice
scalia
what
if
it
was
a
mandatory
termination?
does
the
restoration
provision
not
apply
to
any
mandatory
termination
situation?
justice
scalia
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
we
understand
each
other.
i
was
asking
is
it
always
the
case
that
the
agency
has
the
option,
that
if
they
don't
like
this,
they
didn't
have
to
terminate
in
the
first
place?
couldn't
it
happen
that
the
agency
is
compelled
by
law
to
terminate
it--
justice
scalia
--and
then
what
they
call
an
abusive
follow-on
plan
comes
up?
justice
scalia
i
bet
you
don't
agree,
mr.
kaden,
that
the
agency's
reasons
were
independent
rather
than
cumulative?
justice
scalia
i
know
you...
i
know
you
argue
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
let's
assume
i
disagree
with
you
as
a
point
of
law.
in
fact,
were
the
reasons
that
the
agency
gave
at
the
time
the
agency
gave
them,
were
they
independent
reasons?
justice
scalia
okay.
justice
scalia
why
is
that
any
good?
i
mean...
that...
that,
it
is
seems
to
me,
to
be
the
great
flaw
in
the
government's
theory
that
we're
creating
an
efficient
economic
marketplace
or
something.
i
cannot
imagine
that
unions
are
so
unsophisticated
that
if
we
agree
with
your
position
in
this
case,
they
will
simply
say
in
the
next
negotiations,
okay,
don't
give
us
increased
pension
benefits,
give
us...
give
us
the
money
in
some
other
way.
i
mean
higher
wages
or
whatever.
and
you're
still
have
one
company
competing
against
another
company
at
a
disadvantage
because
85
percent
of
the
pension
benefits
are
being
paid
by
the
fund
for
one
of
them.
why...
why
should
we
stretch
the...
you
know,
to
reconcile
the
bankruptcy
law
and
the
labor
law
in
order
to
preserve
the
necessity
that
the
union
get
its...
its
advantages
in
some
other
way
than
pension
benefits
in
particular?
justice
scalia
you
don't
think
a
union
will
think,
boy,
if
i
let
them
terminate,
the
fund
will
pay
85
percent
of
all
the
pensions
in
the
future?
that
means
this
employer
is
going
to
be
able
to
pay
a
lot
higher
wages.
why
wouldn't
that
be
an
intelligent
thing?
