justice
o'connor
ms.
flowe,
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
benefit...
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
takes
the
position
that
it
can
order
restoration
based
solely
on
the
existence...
coming
into
existence
of
what
it
thinks
is
an
abusive
follow-on
plan
or
must
it
also
include
in
the
calculus
whether
the
company
can...
can
financially
absorb
the
cost
on
restoration?
justice
o'connor
even
though
the
company
clearly
cannot
pay
the
costs,
so
that
it's
going
to
result
in
some
kind
of
immediate
retermination
action
one
way
or
another?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
want
to
understand
the
position,
and
the
position
you
take
is
it
makes
absolutely
no
difference
what
their
economic
condition
is,
that
if
there
is
an
agreement
to
what
you
call
an
abusive
follow-on
plan,
you
can
order
restoration.
justice
o'connor
well,
that
just
doesn't
answer
the
question
at
all.
now,
here
there
was
a
determination
that
three
things
existed
and
they
were...
all
three
were
relied
on.
were
they
not?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
we
thought
that
that
determination
was
not
adequately
supported
on
the
record?
does
that
mean
it
would
have
to
be
remanded
so
that
the
agency
could
think
about
it
again?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
standard
for
a
financial
improvement
did
the
pbgc
apply
to
evaluate
the
situation?
justice
o'connor
did
you
consider
whether
the
tax
waivers
that
had
been
granted
by
irs
in
the
past
would
be
extended
in
the
future?
justice
o'connor
if
that
assumption
were
unwarranted
would
the
finding
be
unwarranted?
justice
o'connor
well,
you
answered
my
question
just
the
opposite
when
i
asked
you.
you
said
that
the
company...
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
relied
on
both
grounds
here.
justice
o'connor
so
which
is
it?
justice
o'connor
let's
try
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it.
did
you
rely
on
both
grounds
or
not?
justice
o'connor
was
that
expressed
any
place
in
the
record
or
in
the
language
of
the
order?
is
that
apparent
or
is
that
something
you're
just
telling
us
now?
justice
o'connor
and
why
is
it
that
it
increases
what
they
can
collect
from
2
to
3
billion?
justice
o'connor
well,
why--
justice
o'connor
does
one
of
the
plans
now
have
no
assets
in
it?
