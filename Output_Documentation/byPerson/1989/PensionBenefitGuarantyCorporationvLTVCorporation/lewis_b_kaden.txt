mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
contrary
to
the
government's
position,
this
case
is
not
about
the
integrity
of
the
insurance
fund,
nor
is
it
about
conspiracies
between
employers
and
unions
to
give
liabilities
to
the
government.
our
position
is
simply
stated.
nothing
in
erisa
bars
the
negotiation
of
replacement
benefits
after
a
plan
termination.
and
indeed,
both
erisa
and
the
policies
of
the
taft-hartley
act
and
the
bankruptcy
code
support
the
negotiation
of
those
benefits.
and
secondly,
nothing
in
this
record
supports
the
conclusion
of
the
government
that
ltv's
financial
improvement...
financial
condition
had
improved
in
the
few
months
between
termination
in
january
1987
and
restoration
that
september.
in
our
view,
the
question--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--should
not,
in
the
absence
of
evidence
of
financial
improvement,
be
a
basis
for
restoration,
and
we
will...
we
will
try
to
develop
that
through
an
examination
of
both
of
erisa
and
of
the
competing
policies
of
these
other
statutes.
the
question
in
this
case...
what
this
case
really
involves
is
a
question
whether
this
government
agency
for
restoring
a
pension
plan
for
the
first
time
in
its
brief
history
met
the
requirements
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
did
they
develop
a
record
adequate
for
review?
did
they
have
an
ascertainable
standard?
did
they
proceed
by
reasoned
analysis?
did
they
have
evidence
to
support
their
assumptions?
did
they
consider
each
relevant
factor?
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
yes.
as...
as
this
court
has
said
in
overton
park
and
state
farm,
in
reviewing
informal
adjudication,
it
is
the
court's
responsibility
to
engage
in
a
thorough
probing
review
to
determine
the
rationality--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--of
the
agency's
decision.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
i
think
those
four
or
five
elements
are
ticked
off
in
this
court's
opinion
in
state
farm.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
as...
as
the
elements
of
rationality.
in
other
words,
if
you
don't
an
ascertainable,
comprehensible
standard,
and
you
don't
have
any
reasoned
analysis,
and
you
haven't
considered
relevant
factors...
that
is
essentially
a
quote
from
this
court's
opinion
in...
in
state
farm...
when
you
add
it
all
up,
what
you
don't
have
is
a
record
adequate
for
review.
now,
in
our
view,
in
this
case,
this
agency
had
a
batting
average
of
zero
on
those
requirements.
let
me
try
to
explain
where
ltv
was--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--if...
if
these
follow-on
plans
met
a
test
of
abuse,
and
if
abuse
were
a
grounds
all
by
itself
in
the
absence
of
financial
evidence--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--for
restoring
the
plans,
then
that
might
be
the
case.
i
think
as...
as
we
argue,
that
simply
cannot
be
the
case
when
one
looks
both
at
the
structure
of
erisa
and
the
competing
policies
of
these
other
statutes.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
it...
it
may
be
possible,
as
the
government
suggests,
that
one
can
imagine
a
circumstance
in
which
an
employer
and
a
union
got
together
and
said
we're
going
to
push
our
liability
off
on
the
government
and
we're
going
to
create
another
defined
benefit
plan
subject
to
the
government's
guarantee.
that
would,
in
effect,
be
a
fraudulent
termination
perhaps--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--and
that
might
be
abusive.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
that's
right.
perhaps
there
is
such
a
thing.
my...
my
suggestion,
justice
white,
is
that
didn't
happen
here.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
not
in
this
case.
in
this
case
what
the
record
shows
unequivocally,
is
that
this
agency
made
a
determination
in
december
1986,
acted
on
it
in
january
1987,
that
ltv
in
bankruptcy
could
not
both
reorganize
and
afford
these
pension
plans.
now,
the
government
didn't
go
to
the
department
of
labor,
which
has
the
power
to
enforce
contributions,
and
say
try
to
get
some
money
from
ltv.
instead,
they
terminated
the
plans.
upon
termination--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--not
upon...
they...
they
asked
us
whether
we
intended
to
fund
the
plans.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
and
we
said
no,
under
the
law
we
cannot
fund
these
pre-petition
obligations,
nor
do
we
have
the
capacity
to.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
and
so
it
was
terminated.
ltv,
following
termination,
found
itself
in
this
position...
8,000
retirees
had
their
income
reduced
from
approximately
$800
a
month
to
$400
a
month.
an
active
worker
with
29-1/2
years
of
service,
counting
the
days
until
early
retirement
at
age
30,
was
out
of
luck.
under
their
limitations,
he
now
had
to
wait
until
he
hit
age
62
for
a
regular
retirement.
an
employee
disabled
on
the
job
was
out
of
disability
insurance.
a
spouse
whose
husband
died
on
the
job
had
no
more
spousal
life
insurance.
in
response
to
those
hardships,
as
well
as
a
strike
threat
by
the
steelworkers--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--oh,
no.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
indeed,
they
do.
making
up
that
difference
between
the
$400
and
the
$800
for
a
shutdown
victim,
they
object
to.
making
up
the
30
and
out,
the
early
retirement
option
for
that
29.5-year
employee,
they
object
to.
that's
part
of
their
abuse
policy.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
well,
of
course,
your
honor,
it's
the
premium
payer.
but
the
fact
is
that
they
had
to
make
a
decision
whether
to
exercise
their
termination
power.
ltv
then
had
to
make
a
decision
how
to
respond
to
strike
threat,
how
to
negotiate
a
labor
contract
pursuant
to
the
taft-hartley
act
and
how
to
respond
most
significantly
to
a
lawsuit
brought
by
the
steelworkers
to
enforce
these
benefit
promises.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
that...
unfortunately,
in
the
position
that
ltv
found
itself,
that
was
not
an
effective
answer.
the...
the
company
did
not
want
to
spend
$70
million
on
replacement
benefits.
it
had
to
because
of
the
existence
of
the
lawsuit
to
enforce
those
benefit
promises.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
not...
not
in
the
absence
of
evidence
of
financial
improvement.
but
the
point
is--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--the
definition
of
abuse
has
to
include
meeting
your
contractual
obligations.
in
this
case
what
the
labor
contract
promised
were
these
benefits.
it
didn't
promise
a
pension
plan
subject
to
the
pbgc's
termination
power.
it
said,
when
you
hit
30
years
of
service,
you
get
this
benefit,
or
if
you
are
victim
of
shutdown,
you
get
this
benefit.
the
pbgc
itself
had
gone
to
the
third
circuit
and
said
that
contractual
entitlement
survives
and
it
is
enforceable
after
termination.
that's
the
heppenstall
case.
the
steelworkers
brought
a
heppenstall
lawsuit
against
us.
we
had
to
contend
with
that.
we
had
very
little
legal
defense,
assuming
that
the
pbgc's
position
and
the
third
circuit's
position
was
right.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
we
were
litigating
in
the
second
circuit.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
second
circuit
had
not
had
an
occasion,
but
our
opinion
was
that
that
was
a
sound
claim
because,
indeed,
the
contract
has
a
life
separate
and
apart
from
the
mechanism
of
funding
that
constitutes
the
pension
plan.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
we...
we
couldn't
fob
off
those
liabilities.
we...
we
wanted
to
but
the
problem
after
ltv
filed
bankruptcy
is
that
the
provisions
of
erisa
gave
us
a
full
stop...
a
sharp
red
light
against
a
voluntary
termination.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
in
the
absence
of
the
steelworkers--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--it
depends
on
the
structure
of
the
statute
and
whether
congress
ever
contemplated
this
theory
of
abuse.
the
fact
is,
if
you
look
at
the
structure
of
both
the
determination
provisions
and
the
restoration
provision,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
if
you
look
at
the
integrity
of
this
statute,
what
you
see
is
restoration
as
a
device
for
dealing
with
financial
turnaround.
financial
turnaround
and
other
financial
factors
we
think
is
the
proper
way
of
reading
that
legislative
history.
when
you
look
at
the
subsequent
legislative
history,
and
we
understand
the
dangers
of
looking
at
that,
as
the
chief
justice
said
in
the
county
of
washington
case,
it
is
perilous,
but
not
wholly
irrelevant.
in
this
case,
they
went
to
congress
and
asked
for
a
bar
against
replacement
benefits
except
pursuant
to
their
standards.
everyone
reflected
in
those
debates
that
it
was
not
the
status
quo
in
the
law.
one
committee
gave
them
that
provision.
three
committees
rejected
it.
and
the
congress
in
1987
rejected
it.
further--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--well,
let's--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--well,
let's
look
at
the
question
of
how
the
agency
exercised
its
judgment.
as
i
indicate,
i
think
the
structure
of
the
act
itself
makes
clear
that
the
policy...
that
the
negotiation
of
replacement
benefits
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
restoration
power
and
is
not
abusive
of
the
statute.
but
if
there's
any
doubt
about
that,
let's
look
at
the
conflicting
mandates
of
other
important
federal
statutes,
and
let's
start
with
the
taft-hartley
act.
section
8(d)
of
the
labor
law,
as
you
know,
says
that
an
employer
must
bargain
over
wages,
hours,
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
we
know
that
retirement
benefits
are
within
that
circle
of
mandatory
bargaining.
we
know,
too,
from
this
court's
decision
in
the
insurance
agents
case
and
others,
that
it
is
a
serious
act
to
circumscribe
the
ambit
of
mandatory
bargain.
the
solicitor
general
says,
well,
of
course,
we
don't
permit
wages
to
be
paid
in
cocaine.
that's
because
their
is
an
explicit
provision
of
the
federal
criminal
law.
but
we
don't
permit
a
government
agency,
either
this
one
or
the
irs
or
anyone
else,
to
go
about
regulating
the
rules
that
apply
to
the
substantive
outcomes
of
bargaining
contrary
to
the
provisions
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
the
bankruptcy
code
in
section
1113
also
provides
that
a
debtor
in
possession
cannot
ignore...
cannot
escape
the
provisions
of
his
labor
contract
unless
he
follows
particular
procedures
that
could
not
be
followed
in
this
case
without
risking
a
destructive
strike.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
on,
no.
indeed,
we
did.
no
one
is
asking
them
to
pay
the
cost
of
the
replacement
benefits.
we
were
prepared
to
pay
that
$70
million
ourselves
and
we
negotiated
concessions
of
$50
million
to
offset
that
cost.
and
the
bankruptcy
court,
as
justice
white
indicated,
approved
that
in
order
to
preserve
the
estate
for...
for
reorganization.
but
it
was
essential
for
us
to
negotiate
that
in
the
free
arena
of
collective
bargaining,
as
required
by
those
laws.
this
agency's
abuse
policy
says
when
you
negotiate
that
replacement
benefit
for
retirees
thou
shalt
not
obey
the
principle
of
seniority.
now,
in
our
labor
history,
the
principle
of
seniority
is
an
important
one.
it's
recognized
explicitly
in
the
military
service
act
and
the
veterans
act.
it's
recognized
in
their
own
statute.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
if
they
were
successful
in
reinstating
the
plan,
two
things
might
happen,
and
it
turns
on
whether
the
contributions
are
owing
or
not
by
a
debtor
in
possession,
whether
they
are
pre-petition
obligations
or
not.
there's
no
question
that
with
the
passage
of
time
the
unfunded
liability
in
these
plans
is
now
over
$3
billion,
and
if
they
were
returned
to
us
today,
the
question
is
do
we
have
to
make
those
contributions?
if
we
do,
our
creditors
would
be
forced
under
the
bankruptcy
code
to
evaluate
whether
liquidation
was
better
than
paying
that
bill.
in
liquidation,
the
plans
would
automatically
be
reterminated
under
section
4041
of
erisa,
under
the
voluntary
termination
standards.
by
contrast,
if
we
didn't
have
to
pay
those
contributions
because
they
were
pre-petition
obligations,
as
the
second
circuit
noted,
then
the
largest
of
these
plans
would
have
to
be
reterminated
immediately
because
it
has
no
assets
today,
and
that
is
clear
if
one
calculates
out
from
the...
from
the
record.
so,
in
either
event,
it
depends
on
whether
it's
a
pre-petition
obligation,
but
we
view
it
as
a
futile
act.
but
it
does
one
thing.
it
changes
their
claim
in
bankruptcy
from
$2
billion
to
$3
billion
to
the
detriment
of
other
creditors
and
to
the
detriment
of
the
principle
of
uniformity
of
treatment
that
is
part
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
the
result
of
this
manipulation,
if
they're
able
to
do
it,
is
that
they
get
a
$3
billion
claim.
today
they
have
a
$2
billion
claim.
those
large
claims
get
satisfied
in
a
reorganization,
if
it
can
be
reorganized,
only
they
get
more
and
everyone
else,
all
other
creditors
get
less.
and
the
result
is
they've
used
the
restoration
procedure
to
manipulate
the
bankruptcy
code.
we
don't
think
congress,
in
trying
to
sort
out
the
tensions
between
erisa,
the
bankruptcy
code
and
the
labor
act
ever
contemplated
that
kind
of
manipulation.
let
me
turn
now
to
the
financial--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--if
the
plan
were
restored
today
and
then
had
to
be
immediately
reterminated
because
it
was
out
of
assets
or
because
the
bankruptcy
court
found
that
a
new
termination
was
necessary
to
avoid
liquidation,
the
only
consequence
of
that
successful
restoration
would
be
to
manipulate
the
recoveries
in
that...
in
that
fashion.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
we
don't
think
the
harmonizing
of
those
three
statutes
could
have
intended
that
result.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
for
two
reasons.
one,
in
the
intervening
time
between
the
time
they
restored...
they
tried
to
restore
these
plans
or
they
terminated
these
plans
and
today,
the
law
changed
to
give
them
100
percent
claim
instead
of
a
75
percent
claim.
and,
two,
over
the
course
of
time
benefits
have
been
paid
out,
no
contributions
go
in,
some
of
the
liabilities
have
been
reduced,
but
other
liabilities
accrue.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
no,
it's
not
money
they've
paid
out.
it's
a...
it's
a
widening
gap.
when
you
measure
the
liability
to
these
plans,
it's
the
present
value
of
all
the
liability
year
by
year
over
time.
and
between
1987
and
january
when
the
plans
were
terminated
and
today,
two
things
have
happened
to
cause
that
gap
to
widen.
one
is
the
accrual
of
more
liability,
as
more
people
retire,
as
more
people
gain
retirement
benefits,
and
the
second
is
the
change
in
the
law
to
give
them
100
percent
claim
in
bankruptcy
as
opposed
to
a
75
percent
claim
in
bankruptcy.
indeed--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--no,
because
the
size
of
their
claim
on
termination
is
fixed
on
the
date
of
termination.
in
other
words,
at
the
moment
they
terminated
these
plans
in
january
1987,
assuming
this
court
affirms
and
the
plans
remain
terminated,
that
claim,
which
is
roughly
$2
billion,
is
fixed.
that
is
the
claim
in
the
bankruptcy.
they
are
our
largest
creditor,
and
they
will
be
satisfied
in
a
plan
of
reorganization
with
however
much
they
get
out
that
process
of
negotiation
and
reorganization.
the
only
way
they
get
to
manipulate
it
is
if
this
court
reverses
and
the
restoration
is
effective
and
then,
for
the
reasons
that
justice
o'connor
and
i
discussed,
the
plans
have
to
be
reterminated.
in
that
case,
they
will
have
succeeded
in
boosting
the
claim
by
a
million
dollars.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
not
because
they
subsumed
the
gap.
because
of
the
passage
of
time
and
the
change
of
the
law.
mr.
lewis
b.

well,
it...
it...
it
is
fact
that
cannot
be
disputed
that
the
largest
of
these
plans,
the
jones
&
laughlin
hourly
retirement
plan,
today
has
no
assets.
it
had
some
assets
in
september
1987
when
they
tried
to
return
it
to
us.
in
the
absence
of
contributions
it
would
predictably
run
out
of
assets
and,
in
our
view,
it
did
some
time
in
1989.
so
under
1341
of...
of
erisa,
they
would
have
to.
they
cannot
leave
a
plan
in
place
that
has
no
assets
to
pay
benefits
for.
they're
obliged
to
terminate
that,
as
indeed
they
did
with
our
republic
salaried
plan,
which
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
in
september
of
1986.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
no.
they
are
pre-petition
debts
because
they
deal...
in
that
case,
the
obligation
was
due
pre-petition.
so
even
under
the
pbgc's
theory,
as
ms.
flowe
indicated,
they're
pre-petition
debt.
but
under
our
theory,
what
you
have
to
look
at
is
when
the
obligation
arose,
when
the
service
for
which
this
liability
was
consideration,
was
provided.
and
that
was
plainly
pre-petition.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
same.
the
irs
waiver
affects
the
pace
of
payment
and
the
interest
you
pay
on
it.
it
does
not
affect
the
status
of
the
claim
in
the
bankruptcy.
let
me
turn
to
the...
to
the
validity
or
the
lack
of
validity
in
our
view
of
the
administrative
record
on
the
financial
improvement
point,
their
second
ground.
now,
we
would
argue
as...
as
i
indicated,
under
the
statute
there
is
no
independent
abuse
ground.
if
you
think
something
violates
erisa,
you
ought
to
ask
a
court
to
declare
it
invalid.
and
in
this
case,
if
they
had
to...
they
tried
eight
times
and
eight
courts
said
no
it
was
not
invalid.
but
if
they
ever
succeeded
in
showing
that
those
replacement
plans
were
illegal,
they
could
be
declared
illegal.
they
would
go
away.
the
contract
provides
for
severance,
and
that
would
be...
and
a
new
negotiation,
and
that
would
the
end
of
it.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
no,
no,
no.
if
it
can
show
that
it's
abusive
in
violation
of
its
own
law,
it
can
ask
a
court
so
to
declare--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--and
the
plan
will
disappear.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
no.
all
i'm
saying
now
is...
i'm
not
back
trying
to...
trying
to
review
the...
the
abuse
theory.
i'm
simply
saying
that
the
restoration
power
is
neither
necessary
nor
appropriate
as
a
remedy
for
abuse.
if
there's
an
abuse,
all
they
have
to
do
is
say
so,
ask
a
court
to
confirm
it.
they
were
in
court.
they
could
have
asked
judge
sand
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york
on
appeal
from
the
bankruptcy
court
to
say
this
was
an
abuse
and
these
replacement
plans
were
gone.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
i'm
not...
i'm
not
suggesting
that
they...
they
are
not
limited
to
that
remedy
if
they
can
show
evidence
of
financial
improvement.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
the
structure
of
the
act
requires
that
in
order
to
return
plans
with
all
these
billions
of
dollars
of
obligations
you
have
to
answer
the
fundamental
question,
which
is
can
the
company
afford
it?
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
i...
i
don't
think
you
read
4047
differently
in
the
context
of
the
financial
improvement
provisions
of
the
terminations
standards
and
in
the
context
of
these
competing
mandates
of
other
statutes.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
other
factors
in--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--in
the
context
in
which
appears.
i
suggest,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
that
it
is
clear
that
that
means
other
financial
factors.
financial
turnaround
is
one
thing
that
could
happen.
but
there
are
other
financial
changes
in
condition
that
could
occur.
without
a
business
turnaround.
you
could...
you
could
get
a
pot
of
money
if
you
had
won
a
judgment
somewhere
and
be
able
to
afford
plans
that...
that
a
year
ago
you
could
not.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
well,
i'm
not
sure.
one
has
to
look
at
the
structure
of
the
statute.
but
financial--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--no,
my--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--no,
because
the
phrase
is
financial
turnaround
not
financial
improvement.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
financial
turnaround
and
other
factors
in
the
context
of
the
whole
statute,
and
in
view
of
these
competing
policies,
i
would
suggest
means
other
financial
factors.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
well--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--well,
i
would
suggest--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--yeah.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
or
to
restore
the
plan.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
i...
i
would
suggest,
though,
that
in
view
of
the
environment
in
which
this
decision
takes
place...
plans
once
terminated
because
the
company
could
not
afford
them...
we
are
now
fencing
off
that
part
of
the
case
and
looking
solely
at
the
replacement
benefits.
replacement
benefits
instituted
in
settlement
of
a
valid
lawsuit
in
response
to
a
strike
threat
pursuant
to
a
mandate
under
1113
of
the
bankruptcy
code
and
8(d)
of
the
taft-hartley
act,
the
agency
has
to
have
more
substance.
there
has
to
be
more
there
to
permit
that
kind
of
circumscribing
of
the
collective
bargaining
process.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
that
was
their
decision.
they
had...
they
didn't
have
to
make
that
decision.
we
could
not
terminate
those
plans
on
our
own.
but
once
they
terminate
them
based
on
their
economic
assessment,
as
they
say
in
the
record,
that
we
could
not
both
reorganize
and
afford
these
plans.
all
we
are
saying
then
is
neither
the
structure
of
erisa
nor
these
other
statutes
permits
this
abuse
to
be
a
grounds
all
by
itself
in
the
absence
of
evidence
of
financial
improvement
to
return
the
plans.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
no.
the...
the...
in
our
view,
you
have
to
be
able
to
afford
a
plan
in
order
to
take
it
back.
because
if
you
don't...
if
you
can't
afford
a
plan,
when
you
take
it
back,
it
will
be
immediately
terminated
mandatorily
again.
and
that
kind
of
ping
pong
effect
could
not
have
been
contemplated
by
the
draftsmen
of
erisa.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
the
only--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--the
only
circumstance
where
a
mandatory
termination
by
them
can
take
place
is
in
the
event
there
are
no
assets
in
the
plan.
and
when
that
happens,
whatever
else
happens,
whatever
other
violations
there
may
be
that
deserve
other
remedies,
you
cannot
return
a
plan
without
assets
to
a
sponsor
that
has
no
money
to
put
into
it,
that
cannot
fund
it,
which
circles
back
to
the
financial
improvement.
because
once
you
do,
if
you
restore
a
plan
without
assets
under
section
4041,
you
have
to
immediately
reterminate
it
and
it
would
be
an
endless
circle.
that
cannot
be
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
drafting
the
restoration
language
of
4047.
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the
financial
improvement.
here
i
think
the
record
is
self-evidently
insufficient.
they
had...
it
was
an
afterthought,
as
the
district
court
noted.
they
had
only
the
same
evidence
before
them
in
september
that
they
had
acted
on
in
january
to
terminate
the
plans,
the
same
two-year
business
plan.
the
record
indicates
no
consideration
of
the
effect
of
reorganization
or
the
prospect
of
retermination
if
they
return
plans
that
cannot
be
afforded.
when
they
did
consider
certain...
certain
factors,
they
failed
to
take
note
of
whether
they
had
any
enduring
quality.
they
noted
a
little
bit
of
cash
build-up
beyond
the
business
plan
in
the
early
months
of
1987.
there
was
a
strike
at
usx
going
on
at
the
time.
there's
no
analysis
in
the
record
of
whether
that
strike
influenced
this
brief
positive
performance.
the
fact
is
that
that
cash
build-up
was
foreseeable,
was
foreseen
in
december,
was
in
the
business
plan,
and
that
was
the
only
evidence
they
had
before
them
when
they
concluded
that
there
had
been
a
financial
change
during
those
five
months.
the
assumptions
they
did
rely
on,
as
the
district
court
found,
were
fundamental
but
completely
unexplained.
the
irs
had
just
denied
a
waiver
in
the
fall
of
'86.
they
assumed
we
could
get
three
waivers.
under
the
statute,
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
you
need
security
for
waivers.
we
had
no
security
to
give,
given
our
status
in
bankruptcy.
they
assumed
that
we
could
keep
the
50
million
concessions
that
we
had
gained
in
exchange
for
the
replacement
benefits,
even
though
the
replacement
benefits
would
be
gone
if
the
plans
were
restored,
a
completely
fallacious
assumption,
no
analysis
of
it
one
way
or
another.
the
fact
is
that
part
of
the...
of
the
record
is
entirely
insufficient
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
i
think
they've
made
clear
that...
that
the
reasons
are
independent.
i
just
don't
think
that's
legally
valid.
i
think
they
have
to
be
mutually
dependent.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
they
were
independent
reasons.
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
their
position
is
that
abuse
by
itself
justifies
restoration,
and
for
the
reasons
i've
indicated,
we
disagree
with
that.
our
final
point
is
the
process
point.
the
question
of
what
procedures
apply
in
informal
adjudication
is,
as
the
solicitor
general
indicates,
an
important
one
not
yet
addressed
by
this
court.
but
let
me
suggest
that
the
suggestion
here,
that
we
didn't
have
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
rebut,
is...
is
fundamental.
it's
fundamental
to
the
development
of
a
record
sufficient
for
review.
so
it
is
not
like
a...
what
the
d.c.
circuit
judge
ginsberg
called
a
design
standard
where
you
impose
procedures
on
an
administrative
agency
which
may
bring
into
play
the
vermont
yankee
mandate
not
to
do
that.
it
is,
rather,
a
suggestion
of
procedures
that
goes
toward
creating
a
reviewable
record.
that
is
a
performance
standard
in
the
phrase
that
judge
breyer
used
in
his
book
on
regulation
and
reform.
and,
indeed,
the
difference
between
imposed
procedural
requirements
which
bring
into
play
vermont
yankee
and
procedures
necessary
to
create
a
record
sufficient
for
review.
that
difference,
which
brings
into
play
overton
park,
is
a
difference
justice
scalia
noted
in
his
vermont
yankee
article
some
years
ago.
we
think
on
that
ground
alone--
mr.
lewis
b.
kaden
--the
case
should
be
remanded.
