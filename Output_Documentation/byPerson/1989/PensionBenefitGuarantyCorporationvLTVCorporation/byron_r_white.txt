justice
white
so
far
you've
argued
this
case
as
though
there
had
never
been
a
bankruptcy
or
any...
any
action
by
a
bankruptcy
court.
does
it
make
any
difference
to
you?
justice
white
what
was
your
standing
in
that
proceeding?
justice
white
as
a
creditor
or
what?
no?
justice
white
well,
why
didn't
you
appeal
the
approval
of
the
plan?
justice
white
of
the
follow-up
plan?
justice
white
so
the
bankruptcy
court--
justice
white
--the
bankruptcy
court
really
said,
it's
none
of
my
business.
is
that...
is
that
it?
justice
white
and
what
were
the...
why
did
he
even
approve
the
plan?
did
he
think...
he
just
thought
that
it
was...
it
was
a...
they
had
the
money
to
do
it,
and
it
was
a
fair
thing
to
do?
is
that...
is
that
it?
justice
white
that's...
yeah--
justice
white
--did
the
creditors
object
to
this
plan?
justice
white
why
would
your
restoring
the
old
plan
cost
the
company
more
money?
justice
white
i've
got
you.
justice
white
and
when
you
restore
it,
you...
you
get
out
from
under
that?
justice
white
any
money
you've
paid
out
is
gone,
i
guess,
but
any
continuing--
justice
white
well,
what
does
it
take
in
addition
to
just...
just
having
a
follow-up
plan
to
be
an
abusive
one?
justice
white
--i
take
it
that
the
agency
keeps
referring
to
an
abusive
follow-up
plan.
justice
white
well,
and
if...
if
it
was
an
abusive...
if
the
claim
is
that
it
was
abusive,
is
there
a
record
to
establish
that?
justice
white
on...
on...
on
request?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
so
you...
and
so
it
was
terminated
then?
justice
white
now,
what
would...
what
would
the...
what
would
the...
what
would
you
have
to
pay
that
you
weren't
going
to
pay...
when
they
reinstated
the
old
plan,
what
extra
obligation
came
onto
ltv?
justice
white
--of
course,
your...
the...
your
opposition
says
that
there...
there
is
no
assurance
that
they'd
have
to
reterminate
anything.
justice
white
what
is
your
position
as
to
the
nature
of
the
liabilities,
the
shortfall
for
'84
and
'85?
are
they
pre-petition
debts
and
does
that
change
depending
on
whether
or
not
an
irs
waiver
is
granted?
