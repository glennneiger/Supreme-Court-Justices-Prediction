justice
kennedy
well,
if...
if
there
were
a
waiver,
would
that
affect
whether
or
not
the
past
due
obligation
was
a
pre-petition
or
a
post-petition
debt?
justice
kennedy
so
it
would
not
be
a
pre-petition
debt
then?
justice
kennedy
if
it...
and
if
there
were
no
waiver,
would
it
be
a
pre-petition
debt
as
to
the
'84-'85?
justice
kennedy
are
there...
are
there
circuit
court
authorities
on
that
point
to
back
you
up?
justice
kennedy
but
during
the
time
you
had
the
plan,
did
you
have
the...
did
you
have
the
discretion
to
use
the
assets
to
pay
current
obligations
or
to
use
your
own
funds?
justice
kennedy
the
statute
says
that
when
you
restore
the
plan
you
turn
over...
back
to
the
company
any
remaining
assets
and
liabilities.
so
i
take
it
that
you
then
have
a
separate
claim
in
the
bankruptcy
court
for
the
liabilities
that
you've
already
paid,
and
they're
no
longer
outstanding.
justice
kennedy
well,
what
difference
does
that...
what
difference
does
that
make
as
to
whether
or
not
there's
an
abuse?
there's
no
scienter
requirement,
is
there,
here?
you
postulated
that
at
the
outset
that
ltv
couldn't
get
together
with
the
union
and
say
let's
shove
off
these
base
premium
costs
on
the
employer.
but
that's
exactly
what's
happened
here.
isn't
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
entitled
to
consider
the
effect
quite
regardless
of
the
intent?
justice
kennedy
well,
no,
no.
we're
just
talking
about
whether
the...
the
definition
of
an
abuse.
justice
kennedy
--but
what
is
the
difference
whether
or
not
you
had
to
do
and
whether
you
chose
to
do
it?
the
effect
on
the
pbgc,
the
effect
on
other
premium
payers,
the
effect
on
the
integrity
of
this
act
is
the
same.
justice
kennedy
suppose
there's
an
irs
waiver?
same?
