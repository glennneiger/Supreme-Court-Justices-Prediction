thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
pbgc's
efforts
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
government
insurance
program
that
insures
the
pensions
of
more
than
30
million
american
workers.
at
issue
is
the
scope
of
the
agency's
statutory
authority
to
restore
a
terminated
pension
plan.
i
will
discuss
how
the
language
of
the
statute,
its
legislative
history,
and
pbgc's
policy
considerations
each
support
its
use
of
that
statutory
authority
in
this
case.
we
begin,
of
course,
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
in
section
4047
congress
authorized
pbgc
to
restore
a
terminated
pension
plan
and
i
quote,
"in
any
case
in
which
the
corporation.
"
that
is,
the
pbgc,
"determines
such
action
to
be
appropriate
and
consistent
with
its
duties
under
title
iv
of
erisa.
"
now,
congress
could
have
said
that
pbgc
could
restore
a
terminated
pension
plan
only
if
an
employer's
financial
condition
had
improved.
or
it
could
have
said
that
pbgc
could
restore
a
plan
where
it
could
persuade
a
court
that
doing
so
was
in
the
public
interest.
but
it
didn't.
what
congress
said
was...
was
that
pbgc
should
make
this
determination,
and
it
limited
our
discretion
only
by
requiring
that
we
exercise
it
appropriately
and
consistently
with
our
statutory
duties.
the
court
of
appeals
slid
right
by
the
statutory
language
though
and
went
immediately
to
the
legislative
history.
and
then,
rather
than
examining
the
legislative
history
to
see
whether
there
was
a
clearly
expressed
legislative
intent
contrary
to
pbgc's
action
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
turned
the
analysis
on
its
head.
the
court
of
appeals
searched
the
legislative
materials
for
an
explicit
reference
to
the
use
of
restoration
that
pbgc
made
here.
not
surprisingly,
it
found
none
because
the
legislative
history
confirms
what
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
says,
that
congress
intended
pbgc
to
determine
when
its
restoration
authority
was
to
be
used.
this
legislative
history
is
sparse,
but
it's
straightforward.
it
says
that
congress
intended
pbgc
to
restore
a
plan
if
a
plan
or
employer
had
a
favorable
reversal
of
business
trends
or
if,
and
again
i
quote,
"some
other
factor
made
termination
no
longer
advisable.
"
the
court
of
appeals
simply
disregarded
this
final
phrase
and
focused
instead
on
the
one
example
given...
a
favorable
reversal
of
business
trends.
the
court
then
concluded
that
was
the
only
circumstance
under
which
the
agency
could
restore
a
terminated
pension
plan.
that
approach
was
contrary
to
this
court's
teachings
in
chevron
and
its
progeny.
and
it
also--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--there
were
two
reasons,
justice
stevens.
the
first
reason
was
because
ltv
adopted
follow-on
plans,
new
pension
arrangements
which,
when
combined
with
the
insurance
payments
that
pbgc
was
paying
under
these
terminated
plans,
effectively
continued
the
terminated
plan
as
if
there
had
been
no
termination
but--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--in
effect,
yes,
justice
stevens.
what
it
means
is
that--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--under
the
statutory
scheme
that
congress
established
here,
pbgc
doesn't
pay
all
benefits
under
an
underfunded
terminated
plan.
congress
specified
that
we
would
pay
only
certain
basic
benefits,
and
even
those
are
limited
by
a
statutory
maximum.
the
follow-on
plan
makes
up
the
nonguaranteed,
the
non-insured
payments
that
pbgc
does
not
pay.
it
also
allows
active--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--sure.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
sure.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
that's
correct.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
that's
correct.
they
will--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--well,
suppose...
let's
take
a
numerical
example
and
suppose
we
have
a
retiree
who
was
receiving
a
pension
of,
let's
say,
$800
a
month--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--under
the
pension
plan
that
terminates.
because
of
our
various
statutory
limitations,
we
may
pay
only
$600--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--of
that
$800.
the
follow-on
plan
would
pay
the
remaining
$200
or
some
substantial
portion
of
that
remaining
$200.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
it
covers
those
people--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--and
it
also
covers
active
workers
who
might
have
had
a
vested
benefit
under
the
old
plan
in
a
certain
amount.
but
once
the
old
plan
terminated,
that
employee
was
no
longer
entitled
to
continue
earning
service
for
additional
benefits
under
that
old
plan.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
that's
correct,
justice
white.
we
would
pay
the
amount
of
the
benefit
that
was
accrued
and
vested
as
of
the
date
of
termination.
the
follow-on
plan
would
allow
that
same
employee
to
continue
earning
additional
benefits
and
to
continue
earning
service
for
purposes
of
becoming
eligible
for
new
benefits.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
well,
i'm
now
referring
to
active
employees.
the
follow-on
plan
covers--
ms.

--the
retirees
would
be
getting
benefits
under
the
old
plan.
ms.

ms.

make
their...
to
make
them
whole,
substantially
whole.
the
active
employees
have
earned
some
portion
of
a
benefit
under
the
old
plan.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
well,
if
they...
under
most
plans,
they
would
have
earned
already
a
vested
benefit,
provided
they
had
sufficient
service.
if
they...
if
they
have
more
than...
than
ten
years
of
service
under
old
law
or
five
under
new
law,
they
will
have
a
vested
benefit--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--and
they
are
entitled
to
receive
that
vested
accrued
benefit...
active
employees
now...
once
they
reach--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--their
normal
retirement
age.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
so,
they
do...
they
do
have
an
earned
benefit
under
the
old
plan,
but
it's
frozen
as
of
the
date
of
termination.
the
follow-on
plan
picks
up
from
that
frozen
date
and
let's
them
continue
earning
additional
benefits,
continue
building
on
that
insured
benefit
as
if
the
old
plan
had
not
terminated,
as
if
it
were
continuing
on.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
from
the
follow-on
plan.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
that's
correct.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
it's
rather
complicated,
justice
scalia,
but
in
most
cases
we
would
pay
the
full
vested
benefit
at
the
time
that
employee
reaches
his
retirement
age.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
there
may
be
cases
where--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--even
that
would
be
limited.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
largely
true.
there
are
cases
where,
for
example,
these
shutdown
benefits--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--if
an
employee
is
already...
or
a
retiree...
is
already
eligible
for
a
shutdown
benefit
at
the
time
that
a
plan
terminates,
he
will
not
receive
the
full
amount
of
that
benefit,
even
though
it
might
otherwise
be
vested,
because
it
will
exceed
the
amount
that
we
would
guarantee
by
some
fairly
substantial
amount.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
that's
correct.
it
could
be
done
that
way.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
that's
absolutely
right.
the
pbgc's
follow-on
plan
policy
was
designed
to
deal
with
this
situation.
these
limitations
we've
just
been
discussing,
these
things
that
employees
lose
when
an
underfunded
plan
terminates,
act
as
sort
of
a
risk-sharing
mechanism.
it
means...
they
mean
that
when
an
underfunded
plan
terminates,
employees
share
the
risk
of
that
termination
with
the
pbgc.
and
that
aligns
their
interests
with
pbgc's
and
against
termination.
if
an
employee
stands
to
lose
benefits
when
his
plan
terminates,
then
he's
going
to
resist
termination,
and
he's
also
going
to
pressure
his
employer
to
fund
the
plan
better
in
the
first
instance.
because
follow-on
plans
eliminate
these
losses
that
congress
built
into
the
statutory
scheme,
they
also
eliminate
the
disincentive
for
termination.
now,
pbgc
has
three
duties
under
this
statutory
scheme.
we
have
a
duty
to
encourage
the
continuation
of
plans.
stated
differently,
to
discourage
the
termination
of
plans.
obviously,
to
the
extent
that
we
prohibit
the
vitiation
of
these
risk-sharing
features
of
the
statutory
scheme
we
discourage
unwarranted
terminations.
we
also
have
a
duty
to
ensure
the
timely
and
uninterrupted
payment
of
benefits
in
plans
that
do
in
fact
terminate.
again,
by
protecting
the
insurance
program
against
unwarranted
terminations,
we
also
fulfill
that
statutory
duty.
and
finally,
we
have
a
duty
to
maintain
our
premiums
at
the
lowest
possible
level
consistent
with
these
other
duties.
here,
too,
if
we
can
discourage
unwarranted
and
unnecessary
terminations,
we
can
keep
our
premiums
as
low
as
possible.
the
follow-on
plan
policy
grew
out
of
a
need
to
do
all
of
these
things...
to
discourage
unwarranted
terminations
so
as
to
protect
the
program;
to
make
sure
that
these
disincentives
to
termination
from
the
standpoint
of
employees
and
their
unions
continue
to
be
maintained
in
the
statutory
scheme.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
justice
o'connor,
the
grant
of
authority
under
section
4047
is
unusually
broad.
however,...
and...
and
it
is
the
agency's
position
that
follow-on
plan
abuse
alone
is
a
sufficient
basis
under
that
provision--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--well,
whether
the
company
can
pay
or
not,
first
of
all,
does
not
necessarily
equate
with
the
immediate
retermination.
here,
for
example,
there
was
no
significant
risk
at
all
of
any
immediate
retermination
because
the
plan--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--at
least
where,
as
here,
there
is
no
significant
risk
that
doing
so
would
be
futile
because
there
might
be
an
immediate
retermination.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
we
did
have
three
grounds
here.
the
third
ground
is...
is
subsumed
within
the
first
two.
but
we
did
also
make
a
determination
that
restoration
was
warranted
here
because
of
the
company's
improved
financial
circumstances.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
i
think
not,
justice
o'connor.
i
believe
that
the
court
could
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
on
the
follow-on
abuse
question
because
there
was
no
significant
chance
of...
of
immediate
retermination
here.
and
please
let
me
explain
why.
when
these
plans
were
restored,
they
had
then
sufficient
assets
to
continue
for
at
least
several
additional
years
without
any
further
contributions
whatsoever.
in
addition,
the
agency
did
make
a
determination
here
that
the
company
could
afford
to
fund
these
plans
at
least
for
the
foreseeable
future.
that
finding
was
not
seriously
challenged
by
the
court
of
appeals.
it
simply
believed
that
it
was
the
wrong
test,
that
we
had
to
make
a
finding
of
long-term
ability
to
afford.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
on
the
separate
ground
of
the
improved
financial
circumstances
warranting
restoration,
what
pbgc
looked
at
was
the
factors
that
had
led
it
to
determine
these
plans
in
the
first
instance.
there
were
several
financial
factors
that
caused
pbgc
to
exercise
its
discretion
under
section
4042
of
erisa
to
terminate
these
plans
to
protect
the
insurance
program
against
the
risk
of
unreasonably
large
losses.
ltv's
financial
condition
did
improve
over
the
next
several
months
leading
each
of
those
factors
to
cease
to
exist.
that
fact
is
really
undisputed
in
this
case
because
those
factors--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--we
did,
your
honor,
assume
that
in
making
our
determination
that
they
had
the
ability
to
fund
at
least
for
the
short-term.
we
did
make
an
assumption
that
the
irs
would
grant
the
company
waivers
of
the--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--no,
your
honor,
it
would
not,
because
if
that
assumption
were
unwarranted,
their
ongoing
contribution
obligation
would
have
been
a
smaller
amount.
those
past
due
contributions,
rather
than
being
amortized
into
their
current
contribution
obligation,
would
have
been
paid
as
a
part
of
their
plan
of
reorganization
a
few
years
down
the
road.
that
was
actually
a
conservative
assumption
that
made
the
amount
of
their
contribution
obligation
slightly
higher.
but
in
any
event,
the
assumption--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--in
our
view,
justice
kennedy,
a...
once
there
was
a
waiver
granted
the
amount
of
the
amortization
payment
which
was
then...
which
would
then
have
been
due
as
a
part
of
the
ongoing
contribution,
would
have
been
entitled
to
administrative
expense
treatment.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
that's
correct.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
at
least
as
to
the
'84-'85
contributions,
those
would
have
continued
to
have
been
treated
as
pre-petition
debts.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
there
is
not.
that
is
a
question
that
has
yet
to
be
addressed
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
we
think
not,
justice
white.
certainly,
we
considered
the
fact
that
ltv
was
in
bankruptcy
here
and
in
fact
we
first
objected
to
these
follow-on
plans
in
a
bankruptcy
court
proceeding.
ms.

connor

we
were
simply--
ms.
carol

--we
were...
we
were
in

a

we

appeal.
and
i
might
add
that
the
bankruptcy
court
did
not
reach
the
merits
of
our
objections.
the
bankruptcy
court
said
instead
that
it
wasn't
appropriate
for
him
to
consider
the
regulatory
objections
we
were
making
and
that
if
we
thought
we
had
some
administrative
options,
we
should
go
exercise
those.
we,
nevertheless,
appealed
his
refusal
to
consider
the
merits
of
that
matter.
ltv
moved
to
dismiss
our
appeal
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
interlocutory.
and
while
this...
at
the
same
time,
we
were
also
considering
the
possibility
of
using
our

once
we
had,
in
fact,
decided
to
use
our

we

dismissed
that

under

these

are
restored

that
is,
they're
restored

that

under...
under
that
employer
liability
provision
in
the
statute.
so
that,
in
any
event,
we...
we
take
a
very
large
loss.
and
that
assumes,
of
course,
that
we
could
collect
100
cents
on
the
dollar
on
our
claim.
and,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
our
historical
experience
has
been
very,
very
substantially
less
than
that
in
terms
of
what
we
are
able
to
recover.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
well,
that's
true.
and...
and--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--one
would
hope.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
well,
not
necessarily,
your
honor,
because
our
claim
would
be
an
immediate
lump
sum
liquidated
claim
for
the
entire
amount
of
that
underfunding,
whereas
the
company's
obligation
under
restored
ongoing
plan
is
only
to
make
each
year
the
statutory
minimum
funding
obligation,
which
in
this
case
is
more
like
$200
to
$225
to
$250
million
a
year
as
compared
to
our
claim,
which
is
for
about
$2
billion.
so
that,
to
say
that
they
can't...
that
they
may
not
be
able
to
pay
100
cents
on
the
dollar
on
a
$2
billion
dollar
claim
is
different
from
saying
they
can
afford
a
$200
million
a
year
funding
obligation.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
we
do...
we
have
not
at
this
junction
paid
out.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
that's
the
present
value
of
the
liabilities,
the
unfunded
liabilities--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--in
that
plan.
but
the
way
the
statute
is
set
up
is
that...
that...
those...
that
stream
of
future
liabilities
is
reduced
to
a
present
value
for
purposes
of
the
liability
claim
pbgc
asserts
against
an
employer
that
terminates
an
underfunded
plan.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
administratively,
pbgc
pays
a
part
of
benefits
under
terminated
plans
from
the
assets
of
the
plan
it
takes
over
and
it
pays
another
part
from
the
premium
income
that
we
receive
from
the
premiums
that
the
statute
requires
us
to
cover--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
we
would
return
over
to
them
what's
left
and
also
what's
left
of
the
liabilities
because
obviously
during
the
interim,
while
this
litigation
has
been
proceeding,
some
of
those
liabilities
have
been
satisfied
as
well
by
our
payment
of
benefits.
so
there
would
be
fewer
liabilities
returned
to
them
also.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
without
a
penny
of
further
contributions
these
plans
would
have
survived
at...
from
the
date
of
restoration
for
several
years.
and,
of
course,
at
that
time
it
might
well
have
been
that
the
company
would
have
been
out
of
bankruptcy
by
the
time
that
the
plans
came
anywhere
close
to
running
out
of
money.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
they
were
independent
grounds.
we
believe
that
follow-on
plan
abuse
alone
is
a
sufficient
ground
under
the
statute,
under
this
broad
grant
of
authority,
provided
that
it
will--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--in
this
case,
it
was
an
independent
ground
for
the
restoration
decision.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
well,
we
did...
i...
i'm
sorry,
justice
o'connor,
i
must
have
misunderstood
your
question.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
we
had--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--we
had
two
grounds.
each
of
them
standing
alone
would
have
justified
our
decision
in
this
case.
we
believed
each
of
those
grounds
were
an
independent
basis
standing
alone
for
restoration
in
this
case.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
i
believe
it
is
probably
not
apparent
from
the
face
of
the
order.
the
order
just
says
we
are
restoring
your
plans
for
these
reasons,
one,
two,
three,
without
discussing
whether
they
each
stand
alone
or
not.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
first
begin
by
addressing
the...
what
i
consider
outrageous
claim
that
we
were
somehow
motivated
here
by
a
desire
to
manipulate
our
claim
against
this
company.
the
underpinnings
of
that
assertion
is
the
new
law
that
was
passed,
which
took...
which
was
passed
three
months
after
we
took
the
action
in
this
case.
obviously,
we
couldn't
have
anticipated
that.
but
that
argument
also
assumes
that
these
plans
are
going
to
reterminate
and
there's
no
basis
for
that
assumption
here.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
plans
themselves
had
more
than
enough
assets
to
continue
for
several
years.
we--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--that
is
incorrect,
justice
o'connor.
as
i
mentioned
in
my
earlier
dialogue
with
justice
kennedy,
because
the
agency
uses
this
proportional
funding,
we've
been
paying
some
of
the
benefits
out
of
our
premium
funds
under
that
plan.
that
does
mean
that
there
will
be
a...
an
amount
payable
back
to
the
agency
once
restoration
is
upheld.
but
the
plan
does
have
money.
it
will
not
have
to
terminate
in
an
mandatory
termination,
if
restoration
is
upheld.
now,
they
also...
mr.
kaden
also
talked
about
the
fact
that
the
company
itself
might
be
able
to
do
this,
absent
a
mandatory
termination.
but
he
doesn't
tell
you
how
difficult
it
is
to
do
that.
as
he
himself
acknowledged,
the
company
couldn't
voluntarily
terminate
these
plans
in
the
first
instance.
and
there
was
a
good
reason
for
that.
it's
because
the
union
wouldn't
let
them.
under
erisa
to
terminate
a
plan
voluntarily,
the
company
has
to
bargain
with
the
union
to
remove
the...
the
contract
bar
to
termination.
if
follow-on
plans
are
not
on
the
table,
it's
altogether
possible
that
the
union
will
not
agree
to
termination
and
will,
instead,
if
it
is
convinced
that
some
financial
concessions
have
to
be
made,
will
make
them
in
other
areas
rather
than
allowing
these
pension
plans
to
terminate
again.
but
even
if
the
company--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand,
justice
scalia.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
be...
if
the
union
doesn't
think
it
can
have
follow-on
plans,
once
the
company
tries
to
negotiate
to
get
permission
to
terminate...
to
reterminate
these
pension
plans,
the
union
will
say
no.
because...
and...
and
only
if
it's
convinced
that
the
company
has
to
have
some
financial
concession
somewhere,
might
it
agree
to
other
kinds
of
concessions
in
order
to
allow
these
pension
plans
to
continue.
and
even
if
the
company
can
convince
the
union
that...
i--
ms.
carol
connor
flowe
--again,
if
follow-on
plans
are
off
the
table,
in
the
agency's
experienced
judgment
in
this
area
no
arrangement
other
than
follow-on
plans,
which
replicate
the
terminated
pension
plan,
have
proven
to
be
as
satisfactory
to
employees
generally.
it
may
not
be
the...
it
may
have
the
same
economic
dislocation,
but
it
should
continue
having
the
very
important
deterrent
effect
to
discouraging
unwarranted
terminations.
thank
you.
