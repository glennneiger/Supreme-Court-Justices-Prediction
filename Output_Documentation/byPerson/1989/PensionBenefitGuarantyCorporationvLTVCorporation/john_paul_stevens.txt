justice
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
for
a
moment?
it
would
help
me
if
i
understood
why
the
termination
decision
was
reversed
in
this
case.
justice
stevens
well...
this
is
what
i
really
need
some
help
on
because
the
briefs
somehow
gloss
over
the
facts,
just
as
you
did
in
starting
out
with
the
statute.
what
does
that
mean?
does
that
mean
that
someone
who
was
getting
a
pension
under
the
old
plan
that's
being
financed
now
by
your
client
could
get
a
pension
under
the
new
plan
too?
justice
stevens
well,
how
could
that
be?
if
they...
if
they
were
already
returned
from
a
closed
plan
or
something
like
that,
how
could
they
earn
a
right
to
a
new
pension
under
the...
under
this
follow-up
plan?
i
don't
understand
it.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand--
justice
stevens
--just
to
get
an
example.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
if
there's
a
closed
plant,
the
people
qualified
for
retirement
benefits
because
the
plant
was
closed
and
they
lost
their
jobs
and
they
were
getting
pensions
and
then
they...
you
terminate
the
plan
so
pbgc
pays
part
of
the
benefits
and
the
ltv
finances
the
balance.
is
that
how
it
worked?
justice
stevens
and
now
those
same
people
will
get
benefits
under
the
follow-up
plan?
justice
stevens
well,
how
can
they
earn
benefits
if
they've
already
retired?
that's
what
puzzled
me.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
i
see.
and
the
follow-up
plan
covers
people
who
have
already
retired
and
are
receiving
benefits
under
the
old
plan.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
but
you
had
to
pay
his
vested?
justice
stevens
well,
this
is
what
i
don't
understand.
how
can
an
employee
who
has
already
retired,
continue
to
earn
benefits?
he's
retired.
he's
no
longer
working.
justice
stevens
but
then
if
they're
active
employees,
they
aren't
getting
benefits
under
the
old
plan.
aren't
they
either
working
or
not
working?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
and
so
that
when
they
retire
in
the
future,
the
part
that
had
vested
you're
responsible
for,
and
the
balance
they
will
pay.
justice
stevens
all
right.
justice
stevens
--yes,
but
even
if...
even
if
you
had
not
restored
the
plan,
would
you
not
be
entitled
as
a
subrogee
to
get
back
your
money,
if
they
are
financially
sound?
justice
stevens
well,
why
wouldn't
you
be
entitled
to
100
cents
on
the
dollar
of
the
money
that
you
had
to
advance,
if
they
are
financially
sound?
justice
stevens
i
thought
that
was
the
amount
you
had
to
pay,
but
that's
the
amount
you
can
recover.
only
75
percent
of
what
you
pay
out?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
well,
but
that's...
i
know,
but
those
are
different
companies.
the
part
of
your...
the
premise
of
the
restoration
is
that
this
is
a
financially
sound
company,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
so
you
should
get
your
75
cents
on
the
dollar
back...
eventually.
justice
stevens
well,
if
they're...
if
you're
not,
then
apparently...
maybe
one
of
the
grounds
for...
there's
some
tension
between
your
position
you
can't
get
your
money
back
that
way
and
your
position
that
they
are
financially
able
to
handle
the
plan.
justice
stevens
well,
you
have
a
$2
billion
claim
but
have
you...
you
have
not
paid
out
that
much
money,
have
you?
justice
stevens
and
that's
the
total
amount
you
are
liable
for?
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
ask
this,
mr.
kaden,
if
it's...
if
it's
true...
i
don't
know
if
it
is
or
not...
as
matter
a
law
that
a
follow-up
plan
such
as
i
think
i
understand
now
went
into
a
place
and
if
that's
a
sufficient
reason
for
restoration,
isn't
the
record
sufficient
to
establish
those
facts?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
yes,
well,
i...
i--
justice
stevens
yes,
but,
mr.
kaden,
if
i
understand
your
opponent,
they
don't
object
to
those
feature
of
the
plan.
justice
stevens
they
object
to
the
features
that
they're...
they're
helping
to
finance.
justice
stevens
well,
i
think
their
abuse
policy
is
based
upon
the
proposition
that
it
would
seem
a
very
strange
intent
for
the
federal
government
to
allow
your
company
to
compete
with
other
companies
in
the
same
industry
who
have
to
pay
the
entire
pension
benefits
for
your
company
to
be
able
to
give
its
employees
the
same
benefits
and
have
the
taxpayer
fund...
fund
85
percent
of
them.
justice
stevens
that's
very
good
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
the
agency
gave
you
a
good...
a
good
tool
to
respond
to
the
strike
threat
by
saying,
look,
if
i
give
you
these
benefits,
we're
going
to
be
back
in
the
soup
because
the...
because
the
fund
is
not
going
to
continue
to
fund
the
85
percent.
