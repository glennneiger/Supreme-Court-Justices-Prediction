we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
89-390,
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
v.
ltv
corporation.
ms.
flowe.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
this
is
really
the
approval
of
a
expenditure
of
funds
to
meet
corporate
obligations?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
flowe.
mr.
kaden,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you...
mr.
kaden,
you
say
then
that
even
the
abuse
of
follow-up...
follow-on
plans
that
apparently
is
cited
by
pbgc
would
not
be
a
basis
for
restoration?
chief
justice
rehnquist
will
you
find
all
of
those
requirements
in
the
administrative
procedure
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
say--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--and
you
infer
from
that
all
those
four
or
five
things
that
you
just
ticked
off?
chief
justice
rehnquist
as
prerequisites?
chief
justice
rehnquist
where...
in
what
circuit
where
you
litigating?
chief
justice
rehnquist
had
the
second
circuit
decided
the
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you...
and
you're
saying
that
was
a
justification
for
fobbing
off
85
percent
of
your
liabilities
under
the
other
premium
payers
from
other
companies?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
is
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--why,
mr.
kaden,
does
it
go
from
$2
million
to
$3
million?
i
mean,
in
terms
of
figures.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
this
is
money
they
have
paid
out.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
wouldn't
they
be
entitled
to
some
increase
over
2
million
just
by
virtue
of
the
fact
of
the
passage
of
time
from
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--because
they
subsumed
the
gap
that's--
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say...
you
say
the
agency
has
no
authority
under
its
mandate
to
itself
determine
that
a
plan
is
abusive
if
it
can't
show
that
it
violates
some
other
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
abuse--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
do
you
mean
it
has
to
point
to
a
provision
of
its
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
maybe
they...
maybe
they--
--well,
why
are
they
limited
to
that
one
remedy?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it
seems
to
me
you
give
very
little
discretion
to
the
agency
and
it
seems
to
me
you
can
read
the
agency's
statute
quite
differently
than
you
do
to
give
them
considerably
more
discretion.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
doesn't
the
very
financial
provision
section
also
say
other
reasons?
chief
justice
rehnquist
other
factors?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kaden.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
flowe
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
flowe.
this
case
is
submitted.
