justice
white
well,
what
if...
what
if
a
state
set
up
a...
say...
say
massachusetts
set
up
an
authority
to...
to
develop
the
harbor
there.
and
there
was
no
interstate
compact
involved
at
all.
and
they
just
set
up
an
agency,
a
department
of
the
state
government
to
develop
the...
to
develop
the
harbor.
would
that
agency
share
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
of
the
state?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you...
i...
i
don't
suppose
you
can
sue
a
state
in
the
federal
court
for
an
injunction,
can
you?
justice
white
well,
in...
in
those
cases
there
is
nothing...
the...
a
state
is
immune
even
though
its
treasury
isn't
in
danger.
justice
white
well,
you're
arguing
waiver
now.
justice
white
i
take
it
you
would...
you
would
say
that
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
is
available
if
the
port
authority
is
deemed
to
be
an
agency
of
the
state?
justice
white
no.
justice
white
even
though...
even
though
there
is
no
risk
to
the
state
treasury?
justice
white
do
you
think
it
has
to
be
the
same...
the
same...
have
the
same
status
in
both
states?
justice
white
well,
are
we
talking
here
about
new
york?
justice
white
so
you
say,
if
it
isn't
an
agency
in
new
york,
it
isn't
an
agency
in
new
jersey,
either?
justice
white
do
you
mean
the
two
states...
the
two
states
couldn't
have
different
views
about
whether
the...
whether
the
authority
is
an
agency?
justice
white
so
you...
so...
so
if
the
second
circuit
is
affirmed...
if
we
affirm
the
second
circuit,
we
are
necessarily
disagreeing
with
the
third?
justice
white
well,
of
course,
it
was
called
a
municipal
corporate
instrumentality
in
the
compact,
wasn't
it?
justice
white
what
did
that...
what
were
the
words
after
those...
that...
that
phrase,
municipal
corporate
instrumentality
in
the
compact?
did
it
say
an
instrumentality
of
the
two
states?
