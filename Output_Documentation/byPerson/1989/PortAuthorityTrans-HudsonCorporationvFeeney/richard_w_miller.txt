mr.
richard
w.
miller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
i'd
like
to
begin,
if
i
may,
by
responding
to
a
question
that
justice
marshall
posed.
in
the
legislation
governing
the
world
trade
center,
the
language
is
quite
specific
that
the
port
authority
is
supreme
in
its
operation.
all
details
of
the
effectuation,
including
but
not
limited
to,
financing,
leasing,
rentals,
tolls,
fares,
shall
be
within
its
sole
discretion.
and
its
decision
in
connection
with
all
matters,
including
the
hudson
tubes,
shall
be
controlling
and
conclusive.
the
port
authority
has
been
described
in
the
enabling
legislation
as
a
body
corporate
and
politic.
it
has
been
described
as
a
private
corporation
in
the
statute
that
authorizes
suit
against
the
port
authority.
it
says,
as
if
it
were
a
private
corporation.
now
the
port
authority
has
broad
powers,
which
it
exercises
as
it
sees
fit.
it
does
not
go
to
either
state
to
get
second
opinions.
it
does
not
go
to
either
state
to
ask
their
approval
for
what
it
wants
to
do.
it
owns
real
estate
in
its
own
name.
it
leases.
it
operates
real
property.
it
operates
marine
terminals.
it
issues
bonds
in
its
own
name.
it
borrows
money.
it
operates
its
own
general
reserve
fund.
and
the
decisions
have
held...
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
that's
cited
in
the
brief...
that
the
bonds
of
the
port
authority
are
not
obligations
of
either
the
state
of
new
york
or
new
jersey.
it
operates
commuter
railroads,
bridges,
tunnels,
the
world
trade
center.
it
even
has
its
own
police
department,
and
they're
called
port
authority
police.
now,
the
best
way,
i
suppose,
to
find
out
what
the
port
authority
really
is,
is
to
see
how
they
describe
themselves.
the
port
authority
describes
itself
in
its
comprehensive
annual
financial
report
in
1987,
which
they
issue
every
year:
unlike
many
other
authorities
and
governmental
agencies,
the
port
authority,
by
law,
must
be
self-supporting.
it
has
neither
the
power
to
tax
nor
the
right
to
pledge
the
credit
of
either
state
to
support
its
general
obligations.
the
port
authority
pays
its
own
way
for
operations
on
capital
investment,
pooling
revenues
earned
from
its
facilities
through
rents,
fees,
fares,
tolls
and
other
user
charges.
it
finances
new
construction,
major
improvements
and
repairs
by
selling
its
bonds
and
other
obligations.
now,
there
is
specific...
there
is
a
specific
section,
7031,
which
says
that
all
bonds
issued
by
the
port
authority
are
deemed
to
be
negotiable
instruments.
and
they
are
traded
widely
in
brokerage
houses
and
the
stock
exchange.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
well,
it
doesn't
have
any
of
the...
the
dressings
of
an
agency.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
it's
been
described--
mr.
richard
w.
miller
--well,
it's
been
described
in
the...
in
the
enabling
statutes
as
a
private
corporation.
it's
been
described
as
a
municipal
corporate
entity.
in
fact,
i
believe
the
second
statute
establishing
the
port
authority...
the
first
statute,
i
believe,
reciting
the
theory
of
the
two
states
working
together
to
develop
the
port
authority.
right
in
that
section,
it
does
not
say
that
it's
an
agency.
it
calls
it
a
municipal
corporate
entity.
it's
never
called
an
agency
in
any
of
the
statutes
that
i've
read,
and...
or
cited
in
this--
mr.
richard
w.
miller
--yes,
your
honor.
i
suppose
the
best
answer
to
your
question
would
be
to
look
at
the
tahoe
case.
in
the
tahoe
case,
although
there
was--
mr.
richard
w.
miller
--i
don't
think
we
have
to
look
at
six,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
sufficient
to
use
the
language
in
that...
in
that
case,
which
says
that...
as
i...
as...
as...
as
i
interpret
it,
the
most
important
factor
to
look
at
is
the
impact
on
the
state
treasury
of
a
judgment
against
the
authority.
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
a
specific
statute
involving
the
port
authority
which
obligates
the
states
only
to
$100,000
as
initial
start-up
fees
and
only
for
a
very
narrow
category
of...
of
expenses.
in
other
words,
they
weren't
able
to
be
used
as...
as
the
port
authority
see
fit.
the
statute
said
office
expenses,
administrative
expenses.
it
couldn't
have
been
used
for
a
judgment.
other
than
that
particular
amount,
$100,000
as
initial
start-up
expenses,
there
was
no
exposure
at
all
of
the
state
treasury
to
any
judgment.
and
as
i
read
the
tahoe--
mr.
richard
w.
miller
--but
it's
not
state
money.
the
monies
that
are
earned
by
the
port
authority
are
plowed
back
into
their
general
reserve
fund.
from
that
general
reserve
fund
they
continue
to
operate
the
authority
and
its
numerous
activities.
and
they
also
use
it
to
issue
their
bonds.
and
the
statute
sets
out
exactly
what
has
to
be
kept
in,
what
percentage
can
be
used,
and
the
like.
but
the
monies
are
not
turned
over
to
the
states
from
the
port
authority's
earnings.
they're
kept
within
the
port
authority.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
well,
your
honor,
without
knowing
some
of
the
specific
sections,
et
cetera...
but
i
would
say
you'd,
again,
have
to
look
at
the...
what
i
consider
the
most
important
factor
in
tahoe,
is
the...
what
happens
if
there
is
a
judgment?
is
the
state
treasury
insulated?
mr.
richard
w.
miller
no.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
well,
that's
handled
in
the
statutes
for
the
port
authority.
i
mean,
that...
there
is
a
specific
section
that
deals
with
injunctions,
where
you
can't
sue
the
port
authority.
7101
says
we
waive
it.
you
can
sue
us
on
any
kind
of
case
with
certain
exceptions,
that
being
one
of
them.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
specific,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
i
would
say
that
is
not
a
state
agency
that
falls
within
the
parameters
of
the
tahoe
case,
which
said,
if
there's
an
impact
on
the
treasury
we
will
consider
it.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
if--
mr.
richard
w.
miller
--i
think
that's
the
most
workable
feature,
yes.
i
think
it's
the
most
practical
way
to
approach
these...
these
problems.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
well--
mr.
richard
w.
miller
--well,
is
your
honor
saying
in
your
question
that
the
question
of
agency
is
somehow
set
out
in...
in...
in...
in
its
description
of
this
police
department?
because
here
we
don't--
mr.
richard
w.
miller
--i...
i
wouldn't
say
it
is
the
exclusive
factor,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
i'm
saying
that
under
the
authority
of
tahoe,
looking
at
that
factor,
appeared
to
be
the
most
important
factor
as
far
as
that
agency
was
concerned
and
as
far
as
this
one
is
concerned.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
well,
your
honor,
i
think
if
it's
clear
from
looking
at
the
agency
that
it
is
in
fact
an
agency,
then
i
don't
think--
mr.
richard
w.
miller
--yes.
what...
what
i'm...
what
i'm
saying
here
is
that
in
the...
in
the
case
of
the
port
authority,
it
is...
it
is
not
an
agency.
it
is
not
set
up
as
your
honor's
example.
this
is
set
up
to
run
a
particular
function.
it's
set
up
by
the
two
states,
and
it
runs
itself.
it
has
its
own
operating
budget.
it
has
its
own
people.
it
has
its
own
land.
it
has
its
own
bonds.
it
doesn't
go
to
the
state
of
new
york
or
new
jersey
for
anything.
as
in
your
honor's
example,
i...
i
would
assume
that,
being
an
agency,
they
would
be
much
more
closely
connected
to
the
state
that...
that
set
them
up.
perhaps
state
officials
would
be...
would
be
partially
running
the...
the
authority.
in
this
case,
other
than
the...
the
commissioner,
the
board
of
commissioners
sits
and
does
as
it...
as
it
wants.
it
doesn't
have
to
go
to
the
state
of
new
york
for
approval.
and
in
fact--
mr.
richard
w.
miller
--but
they
get...
i
believe
the
fcc
gets
some
appropriations
from
congress.
i
believe
that
they
have
reports...
in
this
particular
case,
there
is
no
appropriations
for
path.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
no,
i
don't.
i
think
you'd
have
to
cut
the
ties
a
little
bit
more
than
that.
i
think
you
would
have
to
do
something
such
as
they
have
here,
where
you
have...
the
fcc,
if
it
did,
as
port
authority
did,
if
it
could
own
its
land,
it
if
had
its
own
buildings
it
ran,
whatever,
i
think,
yes,
you'd
become
a
lot
closer
to
answering
the
question
that,
yeah,
there
would
no
longer
be
an
agency.
and
assuming
that
they
no
longer
got
their
funding,
they
no
longer
got
appropriations,
they...
they
had
their
own
board
of
directors
or
board
of
commissioners
that
met
and
ran
it
without
answering
to
congress
or
anyone,
yeah,
i
think
then,
at
that
point
in
time,
you're
moving
away
from
it
being
an
agency.
which
is
exactly
what
i...
i...
i
feel
that
is...
is
the
case
here
with
port
authority.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
your
honor
is
not
talking
about
the
waiver
issue
now?
we're
not
getting
into
that?
mr.
richard
w.
miller
xxx...
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
yes.
now,
on
the
question
of
waiver,
it
would
appear
that
the
two
sections
must
be
read
together.
one
section,
7101
that
says
you
can
sue
us
in
any
court,
in
any
type
of
matter,
with
a
few
limited
exceptions,
injunction
being
one
of
them.
the
other
section
says
we
will
condition
that
upon
the
condition
that
you
sue
us
in
the
port
authority
district.
or
otherwise
there
is
no
jurisdiction
for
such
a
suit.
the
last
part
of
that
section
says
that
is
shall
be
considered
a
private
corporation
for
such
lawsuits.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
believe
it's
clear.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
well,
there
can
be
no
doubt,
for
example,
that
when
the
say
judicial
district
of
the
united
states
they
mean
the
federal
courts.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
well,
i
thought
i
heard
him
say
at
one
point
in
time
that
he
would
agree
that
it
meant
the
federal
courts.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
well,
your
honor,
i
can
only
answer
that
by
saying
if...
if
it's
read
in
conjunction
with
the
prior
statute,
and
they
were
passed
at
the
same
time,
7101
and
7106
were
passed
at
the
same
time,
then
you
would
have
to
conclude,
i
believe,
that
when
they
say
you
can
sue
us
in
any
court
for
any
lawsuit,
and
the
only
condition
we
will
impose
is
it
must
be
within
a
court,
be
it
state
or
federal,
within
the
port
authority
district.
i
don't
believe
that
there
has
to
be
some
prior
determination
of...
of
jurisdiction
before
you...
before
you
can
say
that
judicial
district
means
federal
courts.
i
think,
in
response
just
to...
to...
to
go
into
a
little
background...
there
was
a
case
called
howell,
which
is
widely
cited
in...
in
the
petitioner's
brief.
howell
was
a
case
that
came
down
in
the
district
court
of
new
jersey
in
1940.
the
second
circuit
refers
to
howell
and
says
that
following
that
decision
there
was
response
by
the
legislatures,
and
these
two
sections,
among
others,
were
partially
in
response
to
the
holding
in
that...
in
that
decision,
which
found
that
there
was
sovereign
immunity
in
the
port
authority.
the
second
circuit
said,
partially
in
response
to
howell,
these
two
sections
were
enacted.
the
intent
is...
is
fairly
clear,
i
believe,
that
port
authority
says
you
can
sue
us.
we
intend
for
you
to
sue
us
as
long
as
you
do
it
in
the
port
authority
district,
be
it
a
state
court
or
a
federal
court.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
true.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
i
think--
mr.
richard
w.
miller
--that's
true,
your
honor.
i
would
agree
with
that.
the...
i
think
the...
the...
one
way
to
look
at
the
waiver
is
that
it
is
simply
a...
a
further
condition
to
their
agreement
or
waiver
of...
of...
of
such
lawsuits.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
okay.
i
will.
in
conclusion,
therefore,
i
would
urge
the
court...
i
think
the
holding
of
the
second
circuit
is
good
law.
i
think
it
proposes
and
found
a
workable
solution
to
these
types
of
problems
presented
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
a
good
solution.
i
think
it's
a
reasonable
decision.
and
i
would
ask
this
court
to
affirm
the
holding
of
the
court
below.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
don't
follow
the...
your
inquiry?
mr.
richard
w.
miller
well,
we're
talking
about
a
compact
between
the
two
states.
we're
talking
second
circuit
is
new
york,
yes.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
well,
it's...
it's...
if
it's...
it's
either
an
agency
or
it
isn't.
if
it's
not
an
agency,
then
it...
it...
it...
it's
not
an
agency
in
either
state.
mr.
richard
w.
miller
well,
the
states
have
always
passed
parallel
legislation.
7101...
or
the...
the
general
consent
to
be
sued,
is
just
a
parallel--
mr.
richard
w.
miller
--yes.
