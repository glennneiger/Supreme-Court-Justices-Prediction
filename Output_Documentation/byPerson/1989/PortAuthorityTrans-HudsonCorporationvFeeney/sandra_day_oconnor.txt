justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
lesser,
what
is
the
language,
judicial
district
established
by
the
united
states,
mean,
then,
if--
justice
o'connor
--if
it
doesn't
mean
federal
court?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
is...
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
port
authority
has
never
in
fact
consented
to
be
sued
in
federal
court
in
any
case?
justice
o'connor
mr.
miller,
how
is
it
that
some
degree
of
independence
from
the
state
by
the...
this
agency
mean
that
the
entity,
the
port
authority,
is
still
not
ultimately
controlled
by
the
state,
and
operate
as...
as
states'
agency?
i
don't
see
that
they're...
that
the
fact
that
it
has
some
independence
from
the
states
necessarily
means
that
the
authority
is
not
an
agency
of
the
authorizing
states.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
it's
a
political
subdivision
of
the
states,
like
a
city
or
a
county?
justice
o'connor
is
that
your
position?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
word
is
used,
because
this
would
be
a
federal
question.
and
we
have
to
determine
whether
in
fact,
for
purposes
of
federal
law,
it
shares
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
states.
isn't
that
so?
justice
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
application
of
the
so-called
six
factors
yields
a
crystal
clear
result
here.
because
some
factors
exist
here
on
both
sides
of
that
question.
justice
o'connor
that
sort
of
begs
the
question.
if
the
money
of
the
port
authority
is
state
money,
it's
kept
in
a
separate
pile,
and
it's
still
state
money.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
miller,
a
number
of
states,
i
believe,
certainly
those
with
debt
limits,
have
been
following
the
practice
of
setting
up
separate
state
agencies
to
fund
construction
projects.
for
example,
university
housing.
and
they'll
structure
the
state
board
of
regents
as
an
entity
to
issue
bonds
for
the
housing,
but
not
subject
the
state
treasury,
independently,
to
liability.
now,
under
your
view,
all
those,
what
i
would
have
thought
were
state
agencies,
now
have
no
sovereign
immunity.
and
we
might
have
thought,
for
example,
in
the
state
of
arizona,
that
the
state
board
of
regents
was
a
state
agency
under
those
circumstances.
but
you
would
say
no.
justice
o'connor
well,
but,
liability
of
the
state
has
shielded.
that's
my
assumption.
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
provisions
having
to
do
with
suit
and
the
venue
section
meet
the
standards
set
out
in
the
atascadero
case
for
a
clear,
unmistakable
waiver?
justice
o'connor
how
is
that?
justice
o'connor
yes,
well,
i
suppose
you
heard
mr.
lesser's
explanation
of
what
he
thought
might
have
been
intended
by
that
provision.
justice
o'connor
the
language
meant
the
federal
courts,
but
he
offered
an
explanation
for
why
that
language
might
have
been
inserted
in
there,
that
was
something
other
than
an
intent
to
waive
sovereign
immunity.
