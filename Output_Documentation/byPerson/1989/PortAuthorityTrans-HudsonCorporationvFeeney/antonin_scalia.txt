justice
scalia
mr.
lesser,
suppose
a
municipal
corporation
had
those
characteristics.
suppose
state
law
provided
that
the
chief
executive
officer
of
a
municipality
could
be
impeached
by
the
legislature,
and
was
appointed
initially
by
the...
by
the
governor.
would
that...
would
that
make
a...
a
municipal
corporation
an
arm
of
the
state
for
eleventh
amendment
purposes?
justice
scalia
well,
you...
you...
you
say
that...
you
say
that
either...
either
governor
can
veto
the...
the
action.
justice
scalia
but
being
able
to
veto
it
is
not
the
same
as
being
able
to
direct
it.
in
the
absence
of
a
veto,
i
assume
it's
just
run
by
the...
by
the
governors.
justice
scalia
well,
how
can
it
be
subject
to
legislative
control
when
you
have
to
have
the
two
legislatures
get
together
on
it?
if
the
legislators...
two
legislatures
disagree,
i
suppose
the
authority
does
whatever
it
wants.
justice
scalia
well,
sir,
i...
i...
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
when
you
say
that
the...
that
the
port
authority
can't
do
anything
that
isn't
authorized
by
the...
by
the
legislature.
surely
it
can
do
something
without
a
specific
bill.
i
mean,
why
does
it
have
its
own...
own
independent
executives,
then?
justice
scalia
well...
suppose...
suppose
they
want
to
hire
more...
more
policemen
for
the
tunnel,
or
suppose
they
want
to
paint
a
bridge.
do
they
have
to
get
authorization
from
the
legislature?
justice
scalia
no,
i'm
not
talking
about...
i
understand,
everything
is
subject
to
veto.
justice
scalia
but
i'm
talking
about
prior
legislative
approval.
justice
scalia
well,
then,
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
municipalities.
i
mean,
municipalities
can't
do
anything
that
isn't
authorized
by
the
state.
if
that's
all
you
mean
by
state
authorization,
that--
justice
scalia
--that...
that
you
need
a
state
statute.
justice
scalia
mr.
lesser,
before
you
go
on
to
that.
in
petty,
what
was
the
sue
or
be
sued
clause?
justice
scalia
and
did
it
say
sue
or
be
sued
in
federal
court?
justice
scalia
it
was...
it
was
a
sue
or
be
sued
clause
just
like
yours?
justice
scalia
so
what
you're
saying
is
that
even
under
frankfurter's
view
in
petty,
the
sue
or
be
sued
clause
here
would
have
sufficed.
justice
scalia
let...
let's
assume
the
state
creates
a
statewide
police
force,
a
state
police,
and...
and...
and...
and
it
provides
that
the
state...
that
this
agency
may
be
sued.
and
that
its
liability,
however,
will
not
exceed
its
available
funds.
and
there's
a
separate
funding
for
this
agency
which
it
appropriates
the
funds
every
year.
the
state
treasury
is
not...
not
liable
beyond
what's
in
the
pot
for
that
agency.
you
would
say
that
is
not
a
state
agency,
simply
because
the
general
treasury
is
not...
is
not
liable?
justice
scalia
i...
i
know
that.
i...
i
know
it
doesn't
come
within
tahoe.
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--and
you
think
that
simply
because
of
the
one
feature,
that
the
state's
general
funds
are
not
available
for
judgments,
therefore
it
is
not
a
state
agency?
justice
scalia
that...
that's
very
risky.
well,
it
may
well
be.
but
i
don't
think
anybody
would
believe
that.
justice
scalia
that
if...
if
a
state
creates
what,
in
all
other
respects,
is
thoroughly
a
state
agency,
the
mere
fact
that
the...
that
the
general
state
funds
are
not
liable
in
any
suit,
although
it
makes
it
liable
to
suit
up
to
the
amount
of
its
own...
its
own
budget,
that
alone
makes
it
a
nonstate
agency?
justice
scalia
no,
i'm
just
saying
that
i
never
thought
that
the
criterion...
the
exclusive
criterion
of
whether
a
body
is
a
state
agency
or
not
is
whether
it
can
render
the
state's
treasury
liable.
justice
scalia
but
that
is
what
you
just
said
before,
i
thought.
that
you
don't
have
to
look
beyond
that.
justice
scalia
you
could
say
the
same
about
the
fcc
here...
here
in
washington.
you
can
say
the
same
about
any
so-called
independent
agency.
its
members
are
appointed,
and
once
they're
appointed,
they
go
off
and
do
what
they
want.
justice
scalia
and
you
think
if
the
fcc
were
authorized
to
raise
all
the
funds
it
needed
by
assessments
of
the
people
using
its
services,
or
by
imposing
a...
a
tax
on
television
sets,
or
something,
you
think
that
would
make
the
fcc
not
a
federal
agency
anymore?
justice
scalia
do
we
have
to
regard
that
venue
provision
as
a
waiver?
couldn't
we
regard
it
as
an
indication
that
the
state
did
not
consider
this
entity
to
be...
to
be
the
state?
it
just
assumed
that
it
was
suable
in
federal
courts.
in
other
words,
you're...
you're...
you're
assuming
the
atascadero
test
applies.
but
the
atascadero
test
is
applied
to
a
situation
where
you
know
that
the
entity
is
the
state.
here
we
have
an
entity
that
we're
not
sure
whether
it's
the
state
or
not.
justice
scalia
why
can't
one
say
that
the
venue
provision
doesn't
have
to
be
a
waiver.
it
can
be
an
indication
of
whether
the
states
themselves
regarded
this
entity
as
being
suable
in
federal
court?
justice
scalia
in
which
case
you
wouldn't
need
the
atascadero
level
of...
of
certainty.
justice
scalia
do
you
agree
with
me
you've
got
to
stop
calling
it
a
waiver?
