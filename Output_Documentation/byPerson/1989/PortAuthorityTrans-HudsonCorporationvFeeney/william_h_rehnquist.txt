chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
89-386,
port
authority
trans-hudson
corporation
v.
patrick
feeney.
mr.
lesser.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
were
these--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--i'm
asking
you
a
question,
mr.
lesser,
if
you
will
just
stop
for
a
moment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
were
these
cases
decided
in
the
context
of
the
eleventh
amendment?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lesser,
what
is
the
closest
case
from
this
court
that
has
extended
eleventh
amendment
immunities
to
some
body
other
than
the
state
itself,
or
a
state
official?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there...
there
in
petty
it
was
just
assumed
that
there
was
immunity,
was
there
not?
the
court
didn't
decide
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
that
was
a
dissenting
opinion.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
about
a
majority
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
case
did
not...
that
case
ruled
against
the
particular
entity
in
question,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so...
so
the
court...
there's
never
been
a
holding
of
the
court
extending
eleventh
amendment
immunity
to
any
body
other
than
the
state
itself,
or
a
state
official,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
lesser,
to
what
extent
might
the
general
funds
of
new
york
or
new
jersey
be
held
applicable
to
the
debts
of
the
port
authority?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
lesser.
mr.
miller.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
mr.
lesser,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lesser.
the
case
is
submitted.
