mr.
joseph
lesser
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
port
authority
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
was
created
in
1921
by
a
compact
between
the
states
to
which
congress
consented.
and
the
principal
burden
of
my
argument
today
before
the
court
is
to
demonstrate
beyond
any
question
whatsoever
that
the
port
authority
is
structured,
administered
and
operated
as
a
direct
instrumentality
of
the
compacting
states,
and
is
politically
and
legally
accountable
as
such
to
the
governors
and
legislatures
of
the
compacting
states.
it
should
therefore,
i
submit,
be
recognized
for
what
it
clearly
is:
an
integral
part
of
the
governmental
machinery
of
the
two
states,
completely
subject
to
their
control
and
direction.
as
a
direct
arm
of
the
states,
the
port
authority
should
be
held,
i
believe,
to
share
the
states'
constitutional
protections
and
immunities,
including
their
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
such
a
holding,
i
shall
show,
fulfills
not
only
the
underlying
purpose
of
the
eleventh
amendment's
conceded
deference
to
state's
sovereignty,
but
also
that
of
the
compact
clause,
by
encouraging
the
states
to
solve
cooperatively
their
regional
problems,
thus
enhancing,
i
submit,
the
vitality
of
our
federal
system.
that
the
port
authority
is
unquestionably
a
direct
arm
of
the
states,
fully
subject
to
their
control
and
direction
is
most
easily
demonstrated.
the
compact
declares
that
the
commissioners
of
the
port
authority,
12
in
all,
constitute
the
port
authority.
six
of
these
commissioners
are
appointed
by
the
governor
of
each
state,
with
the
advice
and
consent
of
the
respective
state
senates.
the
commissioners
are
subject
to
removal
after
charges
upon
hearing
in
new
york
by
the
governor
of
the
state,
and
in
new
jersey
by
the
state
senate.
the
governors
significantly
possess
a
veto
power
over
all
actions
which
the
commissioners
of
the
authority
take.
the
authority
cannot
take
any
action
which
is
not
subject
to
gubernatorial
veto.
and
the
authority,
as
an
arm
of
the
states,
is
completely
subject
to
legislative
control
and
direction.
the
authority
has
no
autonomous
powers
of
government,
like
a
county
or
a
municipality,
which
of
course,
counties
and
municipalities
do
not
share
the
states'
sovereign
immunity
from
suit.
the
port
authority
has
no
such
powers.
everything
the
port
authority
does
is
authorized
by
bi-state
legislation.
and
the
port
authority
is
duty
bound
to
be
obedient
to
the
legislatures
and
to
follow
their
directions.
because
of
the
port
authority's
closeness,
intimate
relationship
to
the
compacting
states,
it
is
not
surprising
that
before
1950
and
'51,
when
the
states
waived
the
port
authority's
sovereign
immunity,
every
court
that
had
occasion
to
pass
upon
this
question,
the
courts
of
new
york,
the
courts
of
new
jersey
and
the
lower
federal
courts
held
that
the
port
authority
shared
the
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
of
the
compacting
states.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
this
question
before
the
court
is
really
fact
intensive
or
fact
specific.
a
municipal
corporation
has
autonomous
powers.
as
this
court
said
years
ago,
it's
too
remote
from
the
states.
the
port
authority
is
not
too
remote
from
the
states.
in
fact,
the
only
reason
probably
the
port
authority
is
not
a
department
of
state
government
was
that
the
necessity
of
interstate
cooperation.
it
was
the
necessity
to
draft
a
compact
between
the
states
creating
this
agency.
in
fact--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--absolutely.
mr.
joseph
lesser
well,
they...
what
the
port
authority
does
is
subject
to
legislative
control.
the
port
authority
has
not
inherent
home
rule
powers,
as
do
municipalities
or
counties.
mr.
joseph
lesser
not...
not
at
all.
it
could
only
do
what
the
two
legislatures
authorize.
it
can't
do
what
it
wants
in
the
abstract.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
only
time
the
port
authority
was
held
to
exceed
its
statutory
powers
was
a
case
in
the
early
1950s
when
the
port
authority
thought
it
had
the
power
to
construct
a
third
tube
to
the
lincoln
tunnel,
relying
upon
a
statutory
directive
that
said
that
the
lincoln
tunnel
shall
consist
of
tubes
or
tube...
tube
or
tubes
within
a
narrow
geographical
compass.
and
the
port
authority
thought
that
the
plural
meant
two
or
more.
but
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
held
to
the
contrary.
and
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
said
that
the
port
authority
is
bound...
duty
bound
to
be
obedient
to
the
legislatures.
and
with
that
decision
of
the
new
jersey
supreme
court,
the
port
authority
subsequently
got
a
specific
bi-state
legislation
authorizing
the
construction
of
the
third
tube.
the
port
authority,
justice
scalia,
could
do
nothing
that
the
legislatures
do
not
authorize.
is
completely
subject
to
their
control
in
the
same
way
that
almost
any
department
of
state
government
is
subject
to
their
control.
the
states
originally
tried
to
act
cooperatively
when
they
entered
into
a
compact
in
1919,
relating
to
the
holland
tunnel.
there
were
separate
state
commissions
in
new
york
and
in
new
jersey
that
were
acting
cooperatively.
and
that
just
didn't
work.
it
didn't
work
efficiently.
and
therefore,
the
legislatures,
under
the
compact
clause,
which
as
felix
frankfurter
and
james
m.
landis
wrote
from
the
path-breaking
article
in
the
yale
law
journal
in
1925,
fosters
federalism
by
encouraging
the
states
to
solve
cooperatively
problems
that
transcend
their
state
boundaries
but
yet
do
not
need
national
solutions
at
the
federal
level.
mr.
joseph
lesser
no,
i
think
that
was
the--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--no,
it
was
never
written
into
the
statute.
that
was
the
normal...
that
was
the
normal
assumption
at
the
time,
that
when
the--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--by--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--by
the
general
public,
yes.
mr.
joseph
lesser
and
the
legislatures--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--oh,
i
would
doubt
that,
justice
marshall.
mr.
joseph
lesser
i
would
doubt
it.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
at
the
present
time,
the
port...
the
port
authority
was
originally
funded
by
the
states.
the
states
appropriated
money
until
the
port
authority
became
self-sufficient.
when
the
port
authority
finally
became
self-sufficient,
now
the
port
authority
is
a
source
of
funds
for
the
compacting
states.
in
fact,
the
port
authority
in
recent
years
has
been
subject
to
legislative
direction,
has
been
engaged
in
providing
the
states
with
nonrevenue-producing
projects
that
they...
that
they
need.
the
port
authority's
surplus
funds
are
now
available,
pursuant
to
legislation
and
pursuant
to
gubernatorial
veto
power,
really,
at
the
request
of
the
states
and
subject
to
the
rights
of
bondholders.
mr.
joseph
lesser
i...
i
really
don't
know.
and
judging
from
the
newspapers,
i
would
doubt
it.
mr.
joseph
lesser
i
would--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--i
do.
i
think
there's
a
problem
in
new
york.
the
port
authority
has
no
surplus
funds
as
such.
the
port
authority
funds
are
subject
to
legislative
control.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
states
gave
the
port
authority
the
holland
tunnel,
which
was
a
source
of...
at
least
during
the
1930s
and
'40s...
of
immense
revenue
to
the
port
authority,
they
controlled
the
flow
of
port
authority
funds.
because
the
last
paragraph
in
the
authority's
general
reserve
fund
act,
which
the
legislatures
passed
in
1931,
provides
any
surplus
revenues
not
required
for
the
establishment
and
maintenance
of
the
aforesaid
general
reserve
fund
shall
be
used
for
such
purposes
as
may
hereafter
be
directed
by
the
two
said
states.
and
the
states,
as
i
mentioned
before,
are
now
the
recipient
of
port
authority
funds,
all
subject
to
legislative
direction
and
control.
mr.
joseph
lesser
well,
the
compact,
which
both
state
legislatures
adopted,
states
that
the
commissioners
of
the
port
authority
constitute
a
board.
they
can
hire
a
staff,
provide
for
their
compensation,
and
that
they
should
make
plans
to
be
submitted
for
the
better
improvement
of
the
terminal
transportation
of
the
facilities
of
commerce
in
the
bi-state
port
district
that
should
be
subject
to
legislative
approval.
the
port
authority
makes
plans,
makes
recommendations
to
the
legislature--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--well,
they...
when
they
appropriate...
when
the
port
authority
adopts
a
budget,
that's
subject
to
gubernatorial
veto.
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--right.
mr.
joseph
lesser
well,
the
prior
legislative
approval
to
appoint
a
staff
has
come
in
the
initial
compact.
mr.
joseph
lesser
only
in
a
very--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--only
in
a
very
remote
sense.
municipalities
can
adopt
laws
not
subject
to
gubernatorial
veto.
let
me
specifically
state
that
this
court
has
had
two
cases
involving
compact
agencies.
in
the
first,
petty
against
the
tennessee-missouri
bridge
commission,
this
court...
this
court
assumed
that
the
commission,
which
was
modeled
after
the
port
authority...
in
fact,
i
was
struck
when
i
looked
at
the
legislation
authorizing
the
tennessee-missouri
bridge
commission,
that
legislation
was
almost
copied
word
from
word
from
the
port
authority's
port
compact.
and
the
question
that
this
court
had,
in
justice
douglas'
opinion
was,
the
question
here
is
whether
tennessee
and
missouri
have
waived
their
immunity
under
the
facts
of
this
case.
and
in
that
case,
the
only
major
difference
between
the
compact
authorization
of
that
agency
and
the
port
authority's
was,
in
that
agency
there
was
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause.
and
justice
douglas'
opinion
went
into
detail
whether
that
sue
and
be
sued
clause
constituted
a
waiver
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
mr.
joseph
lesser
no,
they
do
not.
the
waiver
has
to
come
from
the
state
legislatures.
mr.
joseph
lesser
no,
i
think...
i
think--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--i
think
not,
justice
kennedy.
until
1950
and
'51,
the
courts
of
both
states
and
the
lower
federal
courts
held
that
the
port
authority
shared
the
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
of
the
compacting
states.
in
fact,
one
new
york
court
said,
it
is
hard
to
see
how
there
could
be
a
clearer
instance
of
an
agency
sharing
the
immunity
of
its
creators.
and
a
new
jersey
court
said,
since
the
authority
is
undoubtedly
a
direct
agency
of
the
states,
exercising
an
essential
governmental
function
and
is
therefore
an
alter
ego
of
the
state,
it
follows
that
the
present
action
is,
in
effect,
a
suit
against
the
state
itself,
which
will
be
clothed
with
sovereign
immunity
unless
a
waiver
or
consent
can
be
found.
mr.
joseph
lesser
xxx--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
joseph
lesser
no,
not
directly,
no.
they
were
decided...
i
guess
what
this
court
now
calls
common-law
sovereign
immunity
from
suit.
mr.
joseph
lesser
no,
they
were
not.
with
the
decision
of
these
cases
in
1950
and
'51,
both
legislatures
adopted
the
port
authority
suability
legislation.
and
in
that
legislation,
section
1
of
that
legislation
constitutes
the
waiver.
section
1
of
that
legislation
states
that
the
states
of
new
york
and
new
jersey
consent
to
suits
against
the
port
authority.
that's
the
waiver.
that's
the
giving
of
jurisdiction.
the
venue
provision
to
which
justice
kennedy
alluded
a
moment
ago
states,
the
foregoing
consent
is
granted
upon
the
condition
that
venue.
so
you
have
to
find
the
waiver
of
immunity
from
suit
in
section
one.
mr.
joseph
lesser
i
think...
well,
i
don't
know
what
that
statutory
venue
provision
means,
that
reference...
that
obscure
reference
to
federal
courts
in
the
venue
provision.
but
it
certainly
doesn't
meet
the
strict
and
stringent
standard
that
this
court
had
said
is
necessary
for
there
be...
to
be
a
waiver
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
this
court
has
said
that
only
where
stated
by
the
most
express
statutory
language
or
by
such
overwhelming
implication
from
the
text,
as
will
leave
no
room
for
any
other
reasonable
construction,
will
it
find
a
waiver.
mr.
joseph
lesser
i--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--that...
that
undoubtedly
meant
federal
court.
i
think
that
that
reference
was
probably
an
ineffectual
attempt
by
the
states
to
limit
venue
over
actions
brought
against
the
port
authority
in
federal
court,
if
jurisdiction
already
existed.
i
don't
think
it's
effective.
because
i
think
there's
a
general
federal
venue
provision
that
would
overrule
that
provision
of
state
law.
mr.
joseph
lesser
the
port
authority
has
never
knowingly
consented
to
be
sued.
but
when
the
original
statute...
suability
statute
was
passed,
the
port
authority
has
been
a
defendant
in
federal
courts.
this
was
in
the
era,
i
think,
of
pardon
against
alabama
dock
railroad,
when
this
court
stated
that
when
an
agency
is
involved
in
interstate
commerce,
and
congress
regulates
that
agency,
the
states,
by
engaging
in
such
activity,
impliedly
waive
their
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
but
pardon
was
expressly
overruled
by
this
court
a
few
years
ago
in
welch.
and
since
the
welch
decision,
the
port
authority
has
always
maintained
that
it
shares
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
the
port
authority
was
suable
in
federal
courts,
unknowingly,
during
the
era
of
pardon.
but
with
pardon's
being
overruled
by
welsh,
the
port
authority,
i
believe,
shares
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
and
i
think
this
obscure
reference
is
not
the
type...
to
federal
courts...
is
not
the
type
of
knowing
waiver
that
this
court
has
required.
i
don't
understand
it.
the
second
and
third
circuits
disagreed
as
to
its
meaning.
and
if
there
is...
and
with
both
decisions,
the
second
and
third
circuits'
disagreement,
i
don't
think
either
ruling
of
either
circuit
could
be
considered
arbitrary
or
capricious.
and
then
the
question
is,
where
does
the
presumption
lie?
if
the
presumption
was
that
uncertain
language
results
in
a
waiver,
then
there
would
have
been
a
waiver.
mr.
joseph
lesser
it
operates
and
owns
the
world
trade
center,
yes.
mr.
joseph
lesser
no.
no,
that
is
probably
the
transit
authority.
or
the
metropolitan
transportation
agency.
mr.
joseph
lesser
yes.
not
the
port
authority.
the
port
authority's
operation
of
the
world
trade
center
was
linked
by
the
legislatures
to
the
operation
of
the
hudson
tubes,
the
path
system,
which
is
the
focal
point
of
this
suit.
mr.
joseph
lesser
no,
the
port
authority
is
suable,
pursuant
to
the
provisions
of
the
bi-state
suability
statutes
that
were
adopted
in
1950
and
'51.
the
port
authority
is
fully
suable
in
state
court.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
if
this
court
should
hold
that
the
port
authority
possesses
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
these
petitioners
and
others
have
the
normal
workman's
compensation
action
in
state
court.
in
fact,
i
think
these
petitioners
have
an
action
presently
pending
against
the
port
authority
in
the
supreme
court
of
new
york
county.
mr.
joseph
lesser
well,
i...
i
said
that
this...
that
this
court
has
had
two
cases,
petty
against--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--well,
it
was...
it
was
assumed,
yes.
it
was
assumed.
but
justice
frankfurter,
in
his
opinion...
his
dissenting
opinion
in
petty
stated,
had
there
been
no
sue
and
be
sued
clause
in
the
compact,
this
bridge
commission
could
not
have
been
sued
in
the
federal
courts,
despite
the
fact
that
it
was
operating
a
vessel
on
navigable
waters
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
joseph
lesser
the
eleventh
amendment
would
not
have
permitted
it.
mr.
joseph
lesser
that
was
a...
but
two
other
justices
concurred.
mr.
joseph
lesser
the
closest
case
to
this--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--a
majority
case
was
the
opinion
in
the
tahoe
regional
planning
agency
case.
in
that
case,
this
court
set
forth
six
factors.
mr.
joseph
lesser
yes.
and
i
think
wisely
so.
mr.
joseph
lesser
that's
correct.
but
the
court
has
never
had
a
case
where
an
agency
closely...
so
closely
identified
with
the
states
as
the
port
authority.
in
the
tahoe
regional
planning
case,
the
ninth
circuit
adopted
what
this
court
has
called
an
absolute
rule
that
any
agency
that
was
so
important
enough
to
be
created
by
acts
of
two
state
legislatures,
with
the
consent
of
congress,
automatically...
this
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
held...
automatically
possessed
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
of
the
states'.
and
i
think
this
court
quite
properly
rejected
that
absolute
rule.
this
court
set
forth
six
factors
in
which
it
can
be
determined
whether
an
agency
is
so
closely
allied
with
the
states
as
to
share
their
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
mr.
joseph
lesser
it
was
contained
in
the
compact
between
missouri
and
tennessee.
mr.
joseph
lesser
it
did
not.
and
the...
and
the
argument--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--just
like
ours.
but
it
was
before
this
court
required
an
absolute
waiver
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity
in
federal
court.
mr.
joseph
lesser
no,
not
under
frankfurter's
view...
not
under
the
view
of
the
three
dissenters
in
petty.
they
said
that
this
court
should
interpret
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause
as
the
state
courts
in
tennessee
and
missouri
interpreted
it.
and
they
interpreted
that
clause
to
mean
that
the
agency
was
not
liable
in
tort.
and
the
majority...
justice
douglas
stated
that
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause...
that
when
congress
adopted
or
consented
to
the
compact
with
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause,
it
consented
it
to
the
compact
in
the
light
of
an
earlier
decision
by
this
court
in
the
late
1930s
involving
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation...
keefer
against
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation.
and
in
that
case,
this
court
ruled
that
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause
relating
to
a
federal
agency
constitutes
a
waiver
of
immunity.
and
justice
douglas
said
that
that
decision
in
the
keefer
case,
involving
the
reconstruction
finance
corporation,
show
that
congress,
when
it
consented
to
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause,
consented
to
a
full
waiver
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
but
i
think,
as
far
as
the
waiver
provision
is
concerned,
this
court
has,
in
recent
years,
clearly
taken
a
much
more
stringent
view,
saying
that
the
general
sue
and
be
sued
clause
does
not
include
a
waiver
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity
unless
it's
absolutely
crystal
clear.
but
let
me
just
go
through...
your
honor,
the
factors
listed
in
the
tahoe
regional
planning
association
case.
this
court
listed
six
factors.
and
we
think
the
port
authority
meets
all
of
those
six
factors
to
be
accorded
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
first,
this
court
said,
how
were
the
governing
officials
appointed?
are
they
appointed
by
local
governing
boards?
in
that
case,
the
local...
the
majority
of
the
lake
tahoe
regional
planning
association
board
was
appointed
by
county
officials.
then
this
court
said
is
there
a
veto
at
the
state
level?
there
was
no
veto
at
the
state
level
in
that
case.
there
is
a
veto
at
the
state
level
in
this
case.
then
this
court
said
how
is
the
agency
designated
in
the
enabling
state
legislation?
and
the
port
authority,
in
the
enabling
state
legislation,
is
clearly
designated
as
a
joint
or
common
agency
of
the
two
states.
in
fact,
in
the
compact
to
which
congress
consented
be...
there
was
no
sue
and
be
sued
clause
as
i
already
mentioned...
the
legislatures,
in
their
preamble,
stated
that
the
development
of
necessary
terminal
transportation
and
other
facilities
of
commerce
in
the
region
require
the
cordial
cooperation
of
the
states.
and
this
can
be
best
accomplished,
said
the
legislatures,
through
the
cooperation
of
the
two
states
by
and
through
a
joint
or
common
agency.
that's...
and
there
are
many
similar
descriptions
in
the
legislation
of
the
port
authority,
as
the
common
agency
of
the
states.
then
the
next
factor
that
this
court
set
forth
in
the
tahoe
regional
planning
association
case
was
how
was
the
agency
funded.
and
as
i
previously
mentioned,
the
port
authority
was
funded
by
the
state
legislatures
until
it
became
self-sufficient.
and
in
the
early
days
in
its
history,
when...
faced
a
default
on
its
first
bridge
bonds.
and
the
legislatures
were
faced
with
the
problem
of
a
default
by
an
agency
like
the
port
authority,
they
turned
over
to
the
port
authority
their
holland
tunnel,
which,
as
i
mentioned
before,
was
constructed
by
separate
state
commissions
or
state
departments,
operating
cooperatively.
mr.
joseph
lesser
technically,
they're
not...
a
judgment
against
the
port
authority
is
not
payable
out
of
the
state
treasuries.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
states
are
not
adversely
affected
by
judgments
against
the
port
authority
in
the
same
way
that
they're
adversely
affected
by
judgments
against
either
state.
in
fact,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
recognized
that
there
can
be
multiple
state
treasuries
in
a
case
involving
the
port
authority.
in
this
particular
case,
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
was
faced
with
the
problem
of
whether
the
authority
should
have
the
states'
rights
to
require
the
uncompensated
relocation
of
private/public
utilities
in
the
streets
and
the
thoroughfares
of
the
state.
and
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
said
that
that
state
rule
was
equally
applicable
to
the
port
authority.
the
port
authority
cannot
be
thus
divorced
from
the
citizens
and
taxpayers
it
was
created
to
serve.
and
the
new
jersey
supreme
court
stated
that
the
general
state
taxpayer
has
a
tremendous
interest
in
the
financial
solvency
and
the
operations
of
the
port
authority.
i
think
there
can
be
no
doubt,
mr....
this
court,
that
the
port
authority
is
a
direct
arm
an
agency
of
the
states,
and
it
should,
therefore,
share
the
states'
sovereign
immunity
from
suit.
such
a
holding
will,
i
believe,
foster
the
principles
of
federalism
that
both
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
compact
clause
were
designed
to
serve.
i'll
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
joseph
lesser
thank
you.
if
there's
any
doubt
any...
the
mind
of
any
justice
of
this
court
that
the
port
authority
is
a
direct
arm
and
agency
of
the
states
of
new
york,
i
would
really
request
that
you
look
at
appendix
a
to
our
reply
brief.
because
that
appendix
sets
forth
the
150-odd
statutes...
separate
statutes
that
the
states
have
passed
in
reference
to
the
port
authority
from
1921
to
the
present.
those
statutes,
dealing
with
major
considerations
of
state
public
policy
to
minor
housekeeping
chores,
in
my
mind,
demonstrates
beyond
question
that
the
port
authority
is
a
direct
agency
and
arm
of
the
states
that
created
them.
this
list
of
statutes,
by
subject
matter
and
title,
i
think
leaves
no
doubt
in
anybody's
mind...
should
leave
no
doubt
in
anybody's
mind...
of
the
status
of
the
port
authority.
it
has
been...
the
port
authority
has
been
questioned
as
a
state
agency.
it
is
referred
to
in
the
compact
as
a
joint
or
common
agency
of
the
states.
the
reason
why
the
port
authority
was
created
and
given
those
functions
was
that
those
problems
transcend
state
boundary
lines.
the
states
try
to
cooperate
in
the
1919
compact,
to
which
congress
consented,
by
setting
up
independent
commissions
that
were
really
departments
of
state
government
to
act
cooperatively.
it
wasn't
an
efficient
mechanism.
i
think
the
compact
clause,
with
the
eleventh
amendment,
would
fortify
federalism,
would
fortify
the
underlying
principles
of
federalism
by
giving
the
states
the
power
to
set
up
an
entity
like
the
port
authority,
which
is
undoubtedly
a
state
agency.
mr.
joseph
lesser
that
was...
yes,
it
was,
in
contradiction
to
a
normal
municipality.
in
the
same
provision
of
the
compact,
it
refers
to
ordinary
municipal
corporations.
it
was
something
different.
it
was
unknown
at
the
time
what
the
port
authority
was.
it
was
a
major
advance,
i
think,
in
american
public
law
on
government
that
the
states
could
use
the
compact
clause
creatively,
to
create
an
agency
that
would
represent
them
in
all
affairs.
my
opponent
referred
to
the
fact--
mr.
joseph
lesser
--it...
it,
in
other
portions
of
the
compact,
it
refers
to
the
port
authority
as
a
joint...
a
common
agency.
i
just
haven't
got
the
phrase
right
before
me.
but
it
distinguishes
between
ordinary
municipality
and
municipal
corporate
instrumentality,
which
is
the
port
authority.
the
port
authority
is
assuredly
not
a
municipality.
it
has
no
power
to
tax;
it
has
no
general
police
power;
it
has
no
right
to
enact
ordinances;
it
has
no
general
condemnation
power;
it
has
no
home
law
powers.
my
opponent
referred
to
the
provision
in
the
suability
statute
that
the
port
authority
should
be
liable
as
if
it
were
a
private
corporation.
that
provision
was
inserted
to
get
around
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
decision
in
state
against
smith.
unless
that
provision
applied,
specifically
waiving
immunity
from...
creating
immunity...
creating
tort
liability,
the
port
authority
might
not
have
been
liable
in
tort,
even
though
it
was
otherwise
suable.
the
same
language,
practically,
apply...
is
found
in
the
new
york
court
of
claims
act,
where
the
state
waived
its
sovereign
immunity
for
itself
in
the
new
york
court
of
claims.
my
opponent
also
referred
to
some
language
saying
that
the
port
authority,
in
operating
its
facilities,
shall
not...
does
not
have
to
comply
with
rules
and
regulations
of
others.
that
just
means--
