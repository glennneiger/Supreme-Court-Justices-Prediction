mr.
lesser,
do
the
directors
of
the
port
authority
have
the
power
to
waive
immunity
in
any
suit
that
they
choose?
justice
kennedy
well,
if
that's
the
case,
then
it
would
seem
to
me
that
your
construction
of
what
you
call
the
venue
permission...
provision...
is
unacceptable
because
then
we
have
to
interpret
it
as
a
waiver
in
all
cases.
justice
kennedy
if...
if...
if
it's
not
a
venue
provision
because
there's
no
authority
to
waive
on
a
suit-by-suit
basis,
then
maybe
the
best
interpretation
of
that
provision
is
that
it
is
a
waiver.
justice
kennedy
--but
it
would
seem
to
me
that
one
way
to
make
your
interpretation
work
is
if,
on
a
suit-by-suit
basis,
the
directors
could
determine
that
they
will
either
waive
or
not
waive.
but
if
they
never
have
authority
to
waive
on
their
own,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
statute
constitutes
the
waiver.
