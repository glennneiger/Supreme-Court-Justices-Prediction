justice

may
i
ask
a
question
about
your
theory?
i
suppose
it
might
be
possible
for
the
executive
branch
to
deliberately
try
to
thwart
the
policies
set
by
congress,
for
example,
in
a
benefit
program,
if
the
executive
thought
that
program
was
unwise
and
unfortunate
and,
therefore,
in
their
policy
they
would
just
make
it
a
policy
not
to
tell
people
about
deadlines,
or
do
anything
they
could
to
discourage
people
from
taking
advantage
of
the
program
congress
has
set
up.
now,
under
your
theory,
no
estoppel
is
possible.
and
yet
under
those
circumstances
the
executive
would
be
thwarting
the
will
of
congress.
justice

but
that...
that
presentation
does
not
answer
the
question
that
i
raised
before
lunch
where
the
executive
is
in
effect
violating
the
policy
set
by
congress.
