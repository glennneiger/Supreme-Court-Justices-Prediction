we'll

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
our
argument
in
office
of
personnel
management
v.
charles
richmond.
general
starr.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
starr,
the
advise
in
this
case
was
obtained
from
the
navy
employee
relations
specialists?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i...
i
suppose
the
typical
employee
figures
that
these
people
probably
will
know
what
they're
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it's--
--what
would
be
the
basis--
--it's
also
a--
--what
would
be
the
basis
for...
for
that
ruling
if
you're
saying
those
cases
are
different
than
other
kinds
of
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
the...
would
the
carrying
out
of
the
federal
circuit's
judgment
here
really
require
the
expenditure
of
any
money
that
hadn't
been
appropriated
by
congress?
doesn't
congress
appropriate
kind
of
en
bloc
for
these
various
programs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
your
broad
theory
that
you
just
enunciated
or
the
narrow
one
that
you
would
settle
for?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it
didn't
say
estoppel?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
starr.
mr.
deford...
is
that
how
you
pronounce
your
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
deford.
mr.
deford.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
you
don't
need
a
lawyer
just
to
call
the
same
person
that
you
would
have
called
if
you
hadn't
hired
a
lawyer.
do
you
accept
the
explanation
that
the
solicitor
general's
office
gave
of
how
the
error
occurred?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
has
the
court...
has
this
court
ever
held
that
the
government
is
estopped
in
a
situation
like
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's...
it's
left
the
question
open,
has
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
what
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
didn't
even
use
the
word
estoppel?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
didn't
even...
moser
doesn't
even
cite
federal
crop
insurance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
didn't
know
about
it
perhaps.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
a
vested
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about...
how
about
the
hypothetical
that
justice
scalia
put
to
you
where
the
president
says
by
regulation
that
there's
no
earnings
limitation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
they...
how
would
they
have
gotten
the
vested
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
congress
says
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
are
you...
are
you
saying
that
conceivably
by
the
president's
regulation,
contrary
to
what
congress
provided,
saying
there
are
no
earnings
limitations,
people
could
get
money
payments
from
a
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
use
the
term
vested.
just
answer
the
question
without
it,
if
you
can.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
did
the
facts
of
your
case
differ
in
legal
significance
from
the
schweiker
facts?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
would
ordinarily
go
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
reliance,
i
would
think.
there
was
no
contention
in
schweiker
that
the...
the
agent
couldn't
speak
for
the
agency,
was
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
would
think
if...
if
it's
affirmative
misconduct
to
give
out
bad
information,
in
one
case
the
agency
was
guilty
of
affirmative
misconduct,
in
the
other
case
an
employee
of
the
agency
was
guilty
of
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
say...
are
you...
are
you
suggesting
it
was
intentional
misconduct
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
can
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
can
you
tell
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
have
to
go
that
far
to
win
your
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
opm
didn't
have--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--to
do
anything.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
didn't...
are
you
saying
that
opm
had
a
duty
to...
an
affirmative
duty
to
get
information
out
to
people?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
now
you're...
i
think
you've
just
made
two
inconsistent
statements.
i
thought
a
moment
ago
you
were
saying
that
the
opm
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
notify
these
people
of
the
change
in
the
law.
is
that
your
position
or
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now
you've
just
said
it
over
again.
they
had
an
affirmative
obligation
to
make
sure
that
people
knew
what
the
law
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
it...
it
wouldn't
be
enough
for
the
navy
to
say,
we
just
aren't...
we're
cutting
our
personnel
department
because
it
makes
so
many
misrepresentations,
from
now
on
go
to
the
statutes
at
large?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if...
what
if
the
navy
had
done
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
would
have
been
the
result
in
this
case?
he
wouldn't
have
been
misrepresented?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
he
goes
to
another
navy
personnel
office.
but
that's
disbanded
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
the
real
gist
of
your
complaint
that
opm
had
misinformation
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
that
it
had
a
duty
to
advise
them
of...
of
a
change
in
the
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
deford.
mr.
starr,
you
have
four...
general
starr,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
starr.
the
case
is
submitted.
