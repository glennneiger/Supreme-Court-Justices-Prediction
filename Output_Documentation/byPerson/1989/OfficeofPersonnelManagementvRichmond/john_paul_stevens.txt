but
then
are
you
saying--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
in
this
case
there
had
been
a
misdemeanor
to
earn
more
money
than
the...
instead
of
a
forfeiture
of
the
remaining
pension,
you
couldn't
have...
the
government
would
have
been
estopped
from
enforcing
the
criminal
prohibition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
why
is
this...
why
is
this
different
in
terms
of
the
absolute
power
of
no
appropriations
and
all
the
rest...
different
from
the...
as
an
equitable
matter,
tolling
the
statute
of
limitations
against
the
government
for
inequitable
conduct?
why...
why
isn't
that
also
flatly
prohibited
by
the
requirement
that
you
can't
spend
money
the
government
didn't
authorize?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
couldn't
the
court
do
the
same
thing
with
this
statute
and
say
of
course
they
can't
pay
unless
they're
misled
into
having...
having...
you
know,
earned
a
little
more
money
than
they
thought
was
appropriate?
can
you
just...
the
same...
the
same
sort
of
approach,
just
construe
the
statute
to
say
it
makes
an
exception
for
this
kind
of
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
you're...
you're
asking
us
to
overrule
the
moser
case,
aren't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
asking
us
to
overrule
the
moser
case,
aren't
you?
