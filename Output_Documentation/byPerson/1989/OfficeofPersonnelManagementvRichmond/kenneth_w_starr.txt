mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
estoppel
case.
the
issue
is
whether
the
office
of
personnel
management,
which
administers
the
civil
service
disability
retirement
system,
is
estopped
from
applying
and
enforcing
a
statute
passed
by
congress
on
account
of
misinformation,
misinformation
provided
both
orally
and
in
writing
in
the
form
of
an
outdated
opm
form,
which
was
furnished
and
provided
to
mr.
richmond
in
san
diego
by
navy
civilian
personnel.
it
is
our
position
that
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
applying
estoppel
over
judge
mayer's
dissent.
but
more
than
that,
it
is
the
submission
of
the
united
states
that
estoppel
does
not
and
indeed
properly
cannot
run
against
the
government
in
the
execution
of
laws
passed
by
congress.
indeed,
for
almost
two
centuries
this
court
was
clear
and
emphatic
that
the
government,
acting
as
it
must
through
its
employees
and
agents,
cannot
be
estopped
from
asserting
its
rights
and
executing
the
law,
subject
always
to
the
overriding
demands
of
the
constitution.
across
the
judicial
generations
beginning
with
chief
justice
marshall's
court
in
1813
in
lee
against
monroe
and
thornton;
in
the
wake
of
the
civil
war
in
1868
in
the
floyd
acceptances
case;
the
turn
of
the
century
in
pine
river
logging
company;
at
the
close
of
world
war
i
in
utah
power
and
light;
and
in
more
modern
times,
justice
douglas'
opinion
for
the
court
in
united
states
against
stewart;
and
justice
frankfurter's
opinion
in
what
has
become
viewed
as
the
seminal
case
in
this
area,
federal
crop
insurance
corporation
against
merrill.
through
all
these
generations,
the
court
was
clear
and
it
was
consistent
that
in
the
execution
of
public
law
the
government,
in
contrast
to
a
private
party,
cannot
be
estopped.
and
in
our
view
there
are
powerful
reasons,
both
legal
and
practical,
why
this
historic
principle
is
sound.
the
legal
reasons
are
found
in
basic
principles
of
democratic
theory,
and
the
very
nature
of
our
system
of
divided
powers
among
co-equal
branches.
as
this
court
held
in
ins
against
hibi,
and
then
reiterated
less
than
two
years
ago
in
ins
v.
pangilinan,
estoppel,
a
venerable
judge-made
doctrine,
cannot
override
a
public
policy
established
by
congress.
that
is
our
first
point
and
it's
our
most
fundamental.
that
it
is
the
primacy
of
the
elected
branches
in
our
representative
democracy
in
establishing
the
law
that
renders
estoppel
against
the
government
inappropriate.
this
basic
principle
of
our
government
of
the
responsibility
of
congress,
consistent
with
the
presentment
clause,
to
enact
laws
that
bind
the
people--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--under
those
circumstance
i
would
quite
agree
that
the
executive
would
be
actively
seeking
to
subvert
the
will
of
congress.
that
was
the
view
of
several--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--yes.
in
our
view
there
would
still
be
no
estoppel.
in
fact,
that
was
the
view
of
several
members
of
this
court
in
the
hibi
case.
that
the
executive
was
deliberately
not
carrying
out
the
will
of
congress.
and
yet
this
court
determined
that
estoppel
should
not
lie.
and
there
is
a
reason
for
that.
if,
in
contrast
to
the
run-of-the-mill
case...
and
we
believe
this
is,
while
very
unfortunate
for
mr.
richmond,
a
run-of-the-mill
case
of
error...
of
what
justice
frankfurter
in
merrill
called
"ignorant
innocence".
there
was
no
malevolent
motive
on
the
part
of
the
civilian
personnel
in
san
diego
animus
directed
at
mr.
richmond
for
any
reason
whatever.
there
was
a
mistake.
that
is
the
run-of-the-mill
case.
if,
in
fact,
there
were
at
higher
levels
of
the
executive
an
effort
to
thwart
the
law,
then
it
seems
to
us,
and
we
submit
to
the
court,
that
the
appropriate
place
for
redressing
that
kind
of
grievance
is
in
the
congress.
that
congress
itself
knows
full
well
how
to
step
in,
either
through
public
law,
passing
a
public
law
to
address
what
congress
perceives
as
a
subversion
of
its
will--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--under
our
theory,
that
is
correct.
even
if
it
is
knowing
and
intentional.
that
is
not
the
run-of-the-mill
case,
i
hasten
to
add.
but
our
theory
of
the
case
is
quite
right.
in
fact,
it
is
all
the
more
odd
where
there
is
active
subversion
for
that...
for
that...
to
be
given
effect
by
the
courts.
it
seems
to
us
that
the
appropriate
province
of
congress
is
to
address
that
sort
of
situation.
i
do
hasten
to
add
that
in
none
of
the
cases,
save
for
hibi,
has
that
extreme
example
even
been
suggested,
although
there
have
been
actions
by
very
senior
officials
of
the
government
that
have
been
called
into
question,
such
as
in
the
floyd
acceptances
case.
the
action
of
the
secretary
of
war
himself
was
said
to
give
rise
to
an
estoppel.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
we
certainly
would
agree
with
that,
justice
white.
that
in--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that's
our
reading
of
that
case.
that
is
a
criminal
case
and
our
argument
is
in
fact
going
to
civil
liability
that
is
sought
to
be
imposed
upon
the
government
in
contravention.
and
that
is
clear,
that
in
this
instance
the
law
would
in
fact
be
violated
by
enforcement
of
the
court
of
appeals'
order
to
direct
against--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--not
in
a
civil
case.
if
in
fact
the
regulation
were
unlawful
under
governing
statute,
i
think
that
would
be...
that
would
be
the
key
question.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
was.
or
the
interpretation...
there
was--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--in
fact
unlawful--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
quite
agree
that
in
that
instance--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--no.
i'm
sorry.
the
result
would
not
in
fact
be
the
same
in
our
judgment.
in
our
judgment,
in
fact
the
court--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
think
that's
right.
and
the
reason
is
picco
itself
made
clear
that
the
criminal
justice
system
carries
with
it
fundamental
notions
of
elementary
fairness
and
entrapment,
and
that
an
individual
should
not
earn
entity
in
that
case,
should
not
be
summoned
to
answer
criminally
and
then
convicted
for
a
crime
if
the
law
was
not
in
fact
clear.
there
are
any
number
of
doctrinal
protections
that
the
law
must
be
clear
before--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--someone
is
held
criminally
liable.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
don't
think
so
under
this
circumstance
because
i
don't
think
the
formality
of
the
government's
representations
in
this
instance
rose
nearly
to
the
level
as
the
formality
of
formal
interpretations
that
were
before
the
court
in
picco.
that
is
to
say,
no,
i
don't
think
that
a
low-level...
with
all
respect
to
the
navy
civilian
personnel...
i
don't
think
that
a
low-level
civilian
employee
of
the
navy
in
san
diego
has
the
power,
has
the
authority,
to
override
the
law.
and
i
don't
think
it
is
reasonable.
we
presume
in
our
system
of
a
rule
of
law
that
individuals
inform
themselves
of
what
the
law
is.
we
also
make
it
quite
clear
that
individuals
rely,
by
virtue
of
the
venerable
principle
of
no
estoppel
against
the
government...
rely
upon
advise,
either
informal
advise
orally
or
even
when
it
takes
a
written
form,
as
happened
in
any
number
of
cases.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
may
it
please
the
court,
mr.
chief
justice:
this
case,
as
judge
mayer
put
it
aptly
in
dissent,
is
strikingly
similar
to
this
court's
case
in
schweiker
against
hansen.
and
we
believe
that
that
case
controls
this
case
in
terms
of
erroneous
advise
by
the
government,
simply
cannot,
as
a
matter
of
law,
work
or
constitute
the
grounds
for
an
estoppel.
and
in
this
case
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
court
of
appeals
order
in
this
case
to
the
mspb
will
require
ultimately
opm
to
violate
the
law.
at
page
23
of
our
brief
we
set
forth
the
reformulated
statute,
the
rewritten
statute
that
now
embodies
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
federal
circuit.
section
8377(d)
it
should
be
completely
clear
has
been
rewritten.
beginning
with
the
"unless"
language,
the
law
applies
unless
the
annuitant
is
informed
otherwise
by
a
government
official
or
agency.
mr.
richmond,
by
virtue
of
his
earnings
in
calendar
year
1986,
was
not
entitled
to
disability
annuity
payments
during
the
six-month
period...
that
is
ultimately
what
is
at
issue,
a
six-month
period...
of
payments
that
are
in
question.
and
this,
then,
in
our
mind,
represents
one
of
the
most
intrusive
forms
of
estoppel
against
the
government.
and
that
is,
an
order
that
is
corrosive
of
congress'
powers
under
the
appropriations
clause
to
control
the
appropriation
and
expenditure
of
public
funds.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
there's
no
question.
the
typical
employee
would
think
that
a
navy
personnel
officer
would
know
what
he
or
she
is
talking
about.
we
don't
question--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--the...
and
should
know.
we
don't
question
that,
justice
blackmun.
the
navy
should
have
known
in
this
instance.
i
do
note
by
way
of
mitigation
that
mr.
richmond
certainly
was
on
notice
that
he
was
dealing
ultimately
in
terms
of
his
entitlement
to
disability
benefits
with
the
office
of
personnel
management.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
he
lost
in
effect...
yes,
he
did,
justice
white.
he
lost
in
effect
six--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--in
1986
he
earned
more
than
he
should
have.
but
that
resulted
in
his
losing
in
calendar
year
1987
six
months--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--of
his
disability
payment.
he
was
then
restored
by
virtue
of
his
level
of
earnings
during
calendar
year
1987.
his
disability
annuity
was
restored
then,
effective
january
1,
1988.
we
believe
that
there
are
practical
reasons
quite
in
addition
to
fundamental
legal
issues
of
reasons
of
separation
of
powers
and
sovereign
immunity,
as
we
set
forth
more
fully
in
our
brief.
and
the
basic
point
in
this
respect
was
made
over
150
years
ago
by
justice
story
in
the
kirkpatrick
case,
and
we
cite
this
at
page
35
of
our
brief.
that
the
government
acts,
as
here,
and
as
it
always
does,
through
its
numerous
employees...
over
3
million
civilian
employees.
there
are
over
100
navy
civilian
personnel
offices
across
the
country
and
the
globe.
justice
story's
words,
written
in
obviously
a
decided
quieter
time,
have
even
more
force
today.
that
the
government's
fiscal
operations
are
so
various
and
its
agencies
so
numerous
and
so
scattered
that
the
utmost
vigilance
would
not
save
the
public
fisc
from
the
most
serious
losses.
and
that's
our
point.
that
by--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--it
is
enough
to
decide
this
case.
i
would
urge
the
court
before
it
decided,
to
decide
the
case
on
a
narrower
ground.
that
for
30
years
it
has
sought
to
decide
these
cases
in
a
restrained
way
on
narrow
grounds,
leaving
open
various
possible
exceptions.
the
result
is,
as
two
members
of
this
court
noted
in
1981,
that
there
is
not
much
guidance
that
has
been
provided
by
this
court,
with
all
respect,
to
the
lower
courts.
and
the
federal
courts,
as
we
set
forth
particularly
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
are
frankly
all
over
the
law.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
will
not--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--quarrel
that
that
is
now
narrow.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
i
beg
your
pardon?
no,
i
would
not
resist
such
a
ruling
by
the
court.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
because
the
appropriations
clause,
as
this
court
has
noted
in
schweiker
against
hansen
and
in...
in
heckler
against
community
health
services,
raises
a
specific
power
by
congress,
a
power
under
the
appropriations
clause.
and
a
number
of
cases
of
this
court
hold
that
it's
simply
unlawful
for
the
executive
branch
to
expend
a
penny
that
has
not
been
appropriated
by
congress.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
in
that
sense
there
are
federal
monies,
but
not
in
a
accordance
with
law.
that
is
to
say,
congress
has
specified
the
conditions
under
which
money
can
be
expended.
and
that
condition
in
this
case
has
to
do
with
his
eligibility,
the
eligibility
requirements
of
civil
service
disability
annuitants.
and
he
fails
to
live
up,
or
to
satisfy,
those
conditions
that
congress
has
imposed
on
the
expenditure
of
funds.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
the
effect.
that
is
exactly
right,
and
we
think
that
the
courts...
the
lower
courts--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--are
at
fault
in
this--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
accept
that
formulation,
that
it's
the
purpose
that's
involved
and
the
purpose
is
identified
by
the
specific
provisions
of
law.
and
here,
the
specific
provisions
of
law
are
such
that
he,
mr.
richmond,
did
not
satisfy
those
conditions
or
provisions.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
correct.
what...
our
basic
position
is
that
it
is
inappropriate
for
courts
to
order
executive
branch
officials
to
violate
the
law
in
order
to
achieve
what
the
court
believes
is
a
just
result.
and
that
may
be
in
the
form
of
regulation
that
is
promulgated
pursuant
to
delegated
power,
or
it
may
be,
as
here,
the
violation...
and
i
want
to
be
clear
about
this...
this
order
would
require
opm
to
violate
this
statute
by
paying
monies
to
an
individual
who
is
not
entitled
to
them
under
the
statute.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it...
it...
it
portends
of
both
actually.
all
of
our
arguments
lead
ultimately
to
the
point
that
in
our
government
it's
up
to
congress,
consistent
with
the
presentment
clause,
to
determine
what
the
law
is.
and
when,
as
here,
the
law
is
clear,
it
is
inappropriate
for
courts
to
invoke
equitable
principles
to
prevent
the
execution
of
a
law.
but
more
than
that,
to
actually
order
the
carrying
out
of
a
violation
of
that
statute.
and
this--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--where
there
is
in
fact
an
effort...
and
let
me...
let
me
accept
that
the
agency,
as
opposed
to
an
employee...
i
don't
want
to
concede
the
point
that
any
employee's
action
constitutes
agency
action
because
it
may
be
completely
unauthorized.
let
us
assume,
as
i
am
taking
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
in
your
hypothetical
that
it's
the
agency
at
a
policy-making
level,
at
a
high
level,
it
still
seems
to
us,
justice
o'connor,
that
the
remedy
lies
with
congress,
ultimately
with
impeachment,
if
there
is
in
fact
a
dereliction
of
duty
by
the
executive
actively
to
subvert
the
law
because
that
executive
branch
agency,
through
policy-making
officials,
is
no
longer
faithfully
executing
the
law.
that
is
exactly
what
our
system
contemplates.
it
contemplates
obedience
to
law.
it
doesn't
contemplate
a
further
violation
of
law
in
order
to
overcome
or
to
remedy
the
problem
of
erroneous
advise
being
provided.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that
is
correct.
i...
i
accept
the
point,
that
there
could
in
fact
be,
under
those
circumstances,
a
new
program
that
is
executive
branch
formulated
that
would
then
be
given
judicial
sanction.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
that's
exactly
right.
under
principles
of
sovereign
immunity
the
sovereign
is
immune
from
suit,
but
congress
saw
fit
in
1946
to
remedy
that
by
providing...
this
does
in
fact
sound
in
the
nature
of
a
tort
of
negligent
misrepresentation--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--but
congress
did
not--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--if
congress
saw
fit,
yes,
they
could
correct
it
immediately
by
amending
the
fcca,
and
the
congress
very
frequently
acts
in
any
number
of
respects,
as
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief.
not
just
the
private
bill
mechanism,
which
we
do
want
to
urge
upon
the
court
as
a
significant
device
to
remedy...
to
remedy
single
examples.
as
opposed
to
justice
o'connor's
example...
hypothetical...
this
is
a
situation
where
something
went
wrong
in
part
of
the
operations
of
government
at
a
fairly
low
level.
that
is
precisely--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--that
depends
upon
congress'
intent,
and
this
court
has
held
typically
that
a
statute
of
limitations
against
the
government
must
be
strictly
enforced.
it
may
be,
however,
that
the
court
in
analyzing
a
particular
statute
will
determine
that
congress
intended
for
equitable
tolling
principles
to
apply.
that
was
the
case
in
the
city
of
new
york
v.
bowen
case,
that
congress
in
fact
contemplated
there
that--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
don't
know
the
basis,
justice
stevens,
of
construing
the
statute.
the
language
doesn't
admit
of
it.
there's
no
legislative
history
to
which
we've--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--by
virtue
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
and
then,
in
addition
to
that,
i
think
it's
important
for
me
to
note
that
congress
legislates
against
the
backdrop
of
the
law.
and
the
law
has
been
very
clear,
as
i
tried
to
say
before
lunch,
that
there
is
no
estoppel
against
the
government--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
oh,
not
at
all.
we
accept
the
moser
case.
moser,
as
we
read
the
case,
is
a
statutory
interpretation
case
by
virtue
of
the
regulations
that
were
in
effect
there
requiring
a
waiver
by
the
individual
seeking
citizenship
of
his
right
to
citizenship.
we
also
think
that
the
court
was
speaking
in
due
process
language.
that
is
to
say,
its
reading
of
the
statutory
regime
and
regulatory
regime
there
was
informed
by
due
process
considerations.
its
use
of
elementary
fairness,
its
use
of
entrapment
language.
we
think
that
is
a
statutory
interpretation
guided
by
due
process
considerations.
that
has
not
been
asserted
here
and
i
don't
think
it
reasonably
can
be
asserted
here.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
it
specifically
foreswore
the
use
or
invocation
of
the
estoppel
principle.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
respect
factually
to
what
opm
did,
in
our
reply
brief
at
pages
10
and
11,
including
footnote
11,
we
set
forth
in
brief
fashion
what
happened
here.
opm
did,
promptly
after
obra
was
passed
in
september
of
1982,
circulate
information
to
the
effect
that
the
law
had
changed
to
the
various
civilian
employers
of
the
federal
government.
those...
that
information
was
in
fact
received
by
the
department
of
the
navy.
opm,
for
its
part,
no
longer
has
responsibility
or
control.
this
was
a
navy
problem.
so,
just
to
clarify
the
record
in
terms
of
opm.
now,
we've
heard
a
lot
about
the
opm
form
and
the
information
that...
quote...
opm
is
giving
out.
opm
wasn't
giving
out
this
form,
this
was
from
the
navy.
yet,
mr.
richmond
knew
full
well
he
was
ultimately
dealing
with
opm.
every
year
he
sent
in
to
opm
on
an
opm
form
a
statement
with
respect
to
his
eligibility.
if
you
look
at
the...
if
the
court
looks
at
the
appendix,
the
document
that
has
received
so
much
attention
today
in
the
argument,
the
document
on
its
face--
mr.
kenneth
w.
starr
--attachment
4,
page
1(a)
of
our
opening
brief,
does
not,
to
my
reading
of
it,
apply
to
mr.
richmond.
he
was
given
this
form.
we
don't
quarrel
with
that.
we
don't
contest
that.
but
this
form,
on
its
face,
doesn't
apply
to
him.
it
says,
"information
to
applicants
for
disability
retirement.
"
he
was
not
that.
he
was
already
on
disability
retirement.
the
first
sentence
doesn't
apply
to
him.
"your
agency's
review
of
your
employment
record
shows
that
you're
eligible
for
regular...
regular
voluntary
retirement.
"
that's
not
so.
he
wasn't
eligible
for
voluntary
retirement.
we're
not
quarreling
with
the
fact
that
mr.
richmond
received
information
that
was
in
error.
but
we
do
want
to
be
clear
that
opm,
for
its
part,
was
in
fact
seeking
in
a
responsible
way
to
furnish
information
to
the
employing
agency
and
agencies
across
the
country
with
which
the
employees
dealt.
with
respect
to
the
law,
we
have
heard
essentially
an
assault
on
merrill.
merrill
is
good
law.
this
court
has
cited
merrill
as
recently
as
heckler
against
community
health
services,
quoted
extensively
from
it,
and
in
schweiker
against
hansen.
we
continue
to
believe
that
this
case
is
on
practically...
not
entirely...
all
fours
with
schweiker
against
hansen.
the
principal
distinction
is
this
piece
of
paper
that
this
individual,
mr.
richmond
received.
this
court
has
previously
rejected
estoppel
claims
where
writings,
including
specifically
tailored
writings
advising
individuals
or
entities
about
their
particular
circumstances.
i
cite
united
states
v.
stewart,
justice
douglas'
opinion.
i
cite
in
addition,
the
automobile
club
case,
and
there
are
a
variety
of
cases
set
forth
in
our
brief
where
the
government's
erroneous
information
has
been
in
writing.
my
final
point
is
that
congress
has
identified
the
situations
about
which
mr.
richmond
complains
in
a
variety
of
statutes.
at
page
24
of
our
brief
we
identify
a
goodly
number
of
statutes
in
which
congress
has
taken
the
step
to
identify
situations
in
which
it
intends
good
faith
reliance
on
administrative
rulings
or
advise
and
the
like
to
constitute
a
defense.
it
also
has
provided,
as
we
set
forth
in
page
25,
a
number
of
statutes
in
which
governmental
recoupment
of
funds
is
not
permitted
if
it
would
offend
equity
and
good
conscience.
i
thank
the
court.
