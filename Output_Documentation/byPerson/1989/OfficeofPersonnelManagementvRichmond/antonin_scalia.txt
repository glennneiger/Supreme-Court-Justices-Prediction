but
general
starr
maybe
that...
maybe
that
could
be
your
point.
justice
story
is
talking
about
the
public
fisc,
and
this
case
involves
the
public
fisc.
and
the
constitution
specifically
says
that
no
money
shall
be
drawn
from
the
treasury,
no
funds
shall
be
drawn
from
the
treasury
except
by
appropriation.
why
isn't
it
enough
for
us
to
decide
this
case
to
simply
hold
that...
that
provision
of
the
constitution
at
least
cannot
be
overcome
by
estoppel?
and
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
criminal
cases
or
criminal
penalties
or
civil
penalties
or
anything
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
wouldn't
be
very
narrow.
i
mean,
i
think
that's
a...
that's
a
sizeable
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
if
you're
mislead
in
any...
in
any
respect
that
causes
you
to
claim
entitlement
to
some
money
from
the
treasury,
you're
out
of
court
if
your
only
basis
is
the
estoppel.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
terribly
narrowing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
that...
that
recognizing
estoppel
against
the
government
not
only
doesn't
solve
justice
o'connor's
problem
but
perhaps
aggravates
it
because
it
enables
the
president
not
only
to
frustrate
a
federal
program
by
deceiving
people
into
believing
it
doesn't
exist,
but
to
create
federal
programs
where
there
are
none,
which
couldn't
be
done
without
an
estoppel
theory.
that
is,
he
couldn't
tell
somebody,
you're
entitled
to
money,
and
the
person
would
be
entitled
to
it.
the
most
he
could
do
is
tell
him,
you're
not
entitled
to
money,
and
cause
a
person
not
to...
not
to
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
deford,
i
must
say,
even
if...
even
if
the
equitable
doctrine
of
estoppel
were
applicable,
i'm...
it's
not
clear
to
me
how
the
equities
are
in
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
what
your
client
is
complaining
about
is...
is
that
in
fact
his
earning...
his
earning
capacity
had
been
restored.
he
went
out
and
was
able
to
make
as
much
money
as
the
statute
said
would
demonstrate
that
his
earning
capacity
had
been
restored.
i
don't
view
it
to
be
the
purpose
of
this
statute
that
even
though
you
may
earn
enough
money
to
get
off
of
the
public
welfare,
which
this
statute
provides,
you
may
continue
to
sit
at
home
and
earn
right
up
to
the
dollar
next
to
that
even
though
you
still
have
the
working
capacity.
do
you
think
that
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
equitable
case
for
your
client?
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
he
mistakenly
used
the...
the
working
capacity
that
he
had
instead
of
sitting
at
home
and...
and
collecting
his...
his
benefits?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
sue
in
court
claiming
the
benefits
of
equity--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
your
client--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they...
they
are
adhering
to
the
letter
of
the
law.
you're
coming
in
and
saying,
give
us
equity,
and
i
don't...
i
don't
see
a
very
strong
equitable
case
on
the
part
of
your
client.
he
can
earn
enough
money,
demonstrably,
to
not
be
entitled
to...
to
these
funds.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
only
complaint
is...
is
that
had
he
known
that
the
law
was
the
way
it
was,
he
would
have
sat
at
home
instead
of
earned
as
much
money
as
he
could
have.
that's
the
whole
basis
for
the
estoppel.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
don't
consider
that
a
strong
equitable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
phrased
in
the
terms
of
he
will
be
deemed
to
have
had
his
earning
capacity
restored.
the
object
of
the
statute
is
that
when
the
person's
earning
capacity
is
restored,
he
gets
off
the
program.
and
there's
one
way
that
he's
clearly
deemed
to
have
had
it
restored,
and
that
is
if
he's
earning
this
much
money.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
in
accord
with
the
spirit
of
the
statute
to
carefully
calculate
how
much
you
earn
each
year
so
that
you...
even
though
your
earning
capacity
is
restored,
it
will
not
be
deemed
to
have
been
restored.
i
agree
as
a
matter
of
strict
law
your
client
was...
would
have
been
entitled
to
the
money
if
he
had
played
it
that
way.
but
he's
coming
into...
into
court
now
and
saying,
forget
the
letter
of
the
law,
give
me
equity.
if
he
wants
equity,
i'm
not
sure
he
wins.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
was
he
misled
then?
the
only
basis
for
claiming
he
was
misled
is
that
had
i
known,
i
wouldn't
have
taken
the
job.
that's
the
only
basis
for
claiming
an
estoppel.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
he
would
voluntarily
have
refrained
from
earning
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
then,
if
i
had
known
that,
i
would
have
sat
at
home
and
been
idle--
justice
antonin
scalia
--instead
of
getting
off
of
this
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
deford,
how
does...
how
does
your
theory
work
in
a
case
such
as
this?
let's
assume
that
this
statute
was
passed
and
there's
a
limitation
on
earnings
for
beneficiaries
of
$10,000
a
year,
the
statute
is
presented
to
the
president
and
he
vetoes
it.
he
thinks
there
shouldn't
be
any
earnings
limitations,
let
people
earn
as
much
as
they
want
and
still
draw
benefits.
that
veto
is
overridden
so
the
statue
is
enacted
with
a
$10,000
limitation.
the
president
then
issues
a
regulation
that
says
there
is
no
limitation
on
the
amount
of...
on
the
amount
you
may
earn
and
still
draw
benefits.
what
happens?
justice
antonin
scalia
the...
the...
the
president
tried
to
eliminate
the
earnings
provision.
he
was
unsuccessful.
but
he
writes
a
regulation
eliminating
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm...
i'm
asking
what
happens
in
a
lawsuit.
the...
the
people
who
rely
on
his
statement
would
win,
i
assume.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
it
strike
you
as
odd
that
he
can
achieve
by
estoppel
what
he
couldn't
achieve
by
veto?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
about
the
theory
of...
of
what
you're
urging
upon
the
court,
the
theory
that
somehow
the
executive
can
contradict
what
the
congress
has
said
and
make
it
stick.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
had
always
thought
estoppel
was
even
worse
if
it
was
intentional.
you're
telling
me
it's
not
as
bad
if
it's
intentional?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
really
didn't
have
misinformation
out.
it
had
out
a
circular
dated
1976
which
said
what
the
law
was
in
1976.
that
was
accurate.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you're
complaining
about
is
that
it
didn't
have
out
a
circular
that
said
what
the
law
was
in
1986
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
whatever
the
dates
are.
but
it
was
accurate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
far
as
it
went.
