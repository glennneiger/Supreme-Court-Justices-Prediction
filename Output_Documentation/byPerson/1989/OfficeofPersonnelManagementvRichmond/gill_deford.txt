mr.
gill
deford
deford.
mr.
gill
deford
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
not
a
routine,
run-of-the-mill
case,
as
the
government
has
described
it
in
its
briefs
and
before
this
court.
charles
richmond
lost
his
vested
right
to
a
retirement
annuity
as
a
consequence
of
consistently
inaccurate
information
given
to
him
by
his
former
employer,
the
federal
government.
he
made
specific
inquiries
as
to
his
rights
and
obligations
under
the
federal
retirement
law
and
received
in
response
the
official
written...
written
statement
of
the
law
as
prepared
by
the
federal
agency
responsible
for
administering
that
law,
the
office
of
personnel
management.
opm's
written
statement,
however,
was
over
three
years
out
of
date.
and
as
a
consequence
of
relying
on
that
blatantly
erroneous
information,
he
was
divested
of
his...
of
his
already
existing
entitlement.
mr.
gill
deford
justice
scalia,
i
think--
mr.
gill
deford
--absolutely.
mr.
gill
deford
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
what
mr.
richmond
was
doing
was
anything
different
than
what
anybody
else
does
when
they
try
to
find
out
what
the
rules
are.
mr.
gill
deford
i
think--
mr.
gill
deford
--that
something
is
missing.
mr.
gill
deford
he
had
the
one-time
opportunity
in
that
year,
1986,
to
earn
a
little
extra
money.
he
had
significant
debts
and
he
knew
that
his
income
would
go
down
again
in
1987.
he
went
into
the
navy
personnel
office
to
find
out
what
exactly
he
could
earn.
he
assumed
that
there
were
some
limitations
on
what
he
could
earn
and
still
be
eligible
for
a
disability
annuity.
and
he
received
information
which
led
him
to
believe,
and
which
said,
you
can
earn
such
and
such
amount
of
money
for
two
years
straight.
mr.
gill
deford
he
would
have
not
earned...
he
probably
would
not
have
earned
as
much
as
he
did.
mr.
gill
deford
he
was
only
three
percent
over
the
rule
as
it
was.
mr.
gill
deford
congress--
mr.
gill
deford
--just
one
more
point,
justice
scalia.
congress
has
set
an
80
percent
limit
on
how
much
the
individual
can
earn.
so
congress
obviously
contemplates
that
most
people
will
be
earning
some
money.
they
didn't
set
a
five
or
ten
percent
limit,
they
set
an
80
percent
limit.
so,
people
can
earn
up
to
that
limit
and
there's
no
suggestion
that
earning
up
to
that
limit
is
improper
or
inequitable.
mr.
gill
deford
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
your
interpretation
of
the
law's
purpose
is
inaccurate.
the
law
is
structured
in
such
a
way
that
people
will
get
off
for
a
time
being
and
then
they
may
get
right
back
on
again.
what
happened
to
mr.
richmond
in
that
respect
is
not
unusual.
he
was
only
off
benefits
for
six
months.
and
then,
because
his
income
went
down
again,
as
he
had
anticipated,
significantly,
he
was
able
to
get
back
on
again.
there
was
never
any
suggestion
that
he
was
not
disabled.
his
disability
has
continued
up
to
now.
his
earnings
went
up
for
a
very
short
period
of
time,
and
it
happened
to
go
over
the
limit
by
a
few
percent.
mr.
gill
deford
no,
your
honor--
mr.
gill
deford
--he
was
misled
because
he
was
led
to
believe
that
the
old
law
was
in
effect,
and
the
old
law
allowed
him
to
earn
80
percent
for
two
years
in
a
row.
the
new
law
said
80
percent
in
one
year.
he
earned
83
percent
and
then
all
of
the
sudden
finds
out
he's
subject
to
a
law
which
he
had
not
been
told
about.
and
so
he
went
back
off--
mr.
gill
deford
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
gill
deford
he
would
have
earned
money
anyhow.
he
had
an
opportunity
for
temporary
overtime,
which
he
took.
he
took
some
of
it,
but
he
probably
would
not
have
taken
all
of
it
had
he
known
that
there
was
a
one-year
80
percent
rule.
so,
he
would
not
have
sat
at
home
in
any
event.
mr.
gill
deford
well,
justice
white,
i
think
that's
not
a
bad
point,
because
i
think
that's
absolutely
one
of
the
practical
consequences
of
the
government's
position,
that
no
one,
including
a
social
security
recipient,
would
take
any
action
now,
vis-a-vis
the
government,
without
contacting
a
lawyer.
and
i
find
that
a
very
unusual
public
policy
for
this
government
to
encourage.
in
fact,
even
getting
your
own
lawyer
wouldn't
do
you
any
good
other
than
it
would
give
you
somebody
to
sue
if
the
information
the
lawyer
gave
you
turned
out
to
be
wrong,
because
you
still
could
not
trust
the
information
the
government
had
given
you.
the
essence
of
the
government's
position
is--
mr.
gill
deford
--maybe,
but
i
hope
the
lawyer
would
have
looked
it
up
in
the
statute
books.
mr.
gill
deford
only
in
the
sense
that
it...
it
briefly
details
the
facts.
in
fact,
here,
justice
o'connor,
the
information
which
mr.
richmond
received
was
in
a
written
statement
from
the
office
of
personnel
management.
it
was
not
from
some
low-level
navy
employee.
the
low-level
navy
employees
were
simply
reading
the
information
which
they
had
been
given
by
the
office
of
personnel
management
and
which
no
one--
mr.
gill
deford
--it
was,
at
the
time
mr.
richmond
received
it,
approximately
four
and
a
half
years
out
of
date,
and
i
believe
it
remained
out
of
date
in
that
particular
office
until
1987
when
finally
mr.
richmond,
at
their
request,
brought
in
the
notice
informing
him
that
he
had
been
taken
off
the
disability
annuity
because
he
had
violated
the
one-year
rule.
so,
it
was
out
of
date
in
that
office
for
at
least
six
years.
he
did
obtain
relief
here,
as
we've
noted,
from
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
gill
deford
--which...
which
applied
the
traditional
common
law
doctrine
of
equitable
estoppel
to
require
the
government
to
apply
the
law
as
it
was
formerly
in
effect.
that
was
the
result
of
the
estoppel
in
this
case.
to
apply...
to
require
the
government
to
apply
the
law
as
it
had
been
in
effect
and
as
it
had
been
repeatedly
explained
to
mr.
richmond.
the
government
contends,
however,
that
estoppel
is
precluded
by
another
common
law
doctrine.
by
sovereign
immunity
and
also
by
separation
of
powers
principles.
but
estoppel
has
historically
been
recognized
as
an
exception
to
sovereign
immunity
and
congress
has
shown
no
interest
in
altering
that
relationship.
mr.
gill
deford
i
think
it's...
it's
held
at
least
twice
that
the
government
should
be
estopped,
although
it
did
not
use
that
language,
your
honor.
in
the
moser
and
picco
cases.
and
in
six
decisions
since
1960,
it
has
implied
that
the
government
could
be
estopped
without
actually--
mr.
gill
deford
--i
would
say
that
it
has
left
the
question
open
but
it
has
strongly
hinted
that
estoppel
might
be
appropriate
if
certain
circumstances
existed.
in
fact,
i
would
note
that
in
the
government's
presentation
the
history
of
estoppel
stops
at
1947
at
the
so-called
seminal
case
of
merrill,
federal
crop
insurance
corporation
v.
merrill.
there
has
been,
as
i've
just
suggested,
significant
developments
in
the
estoppel
area
since
1947.
i
think
most
commentators
and
many
lower
courts
assume
that
the
merrill
case,
which
was
a
five
to
four
decision,
has
since
been
rejected
or
at
least
seriously
undermined.
mr.
gill
deford
i
think
the
moser
case
in
1951,
just
four
years
later.
mr.
gill
deford
it
declined
to
use
the
word
estoppel,
your
honor,
but
all
of
the
language
in
that
case
is
estoppel-like
language.
and
i
think
more
important,
it
has
exactly
the
same
structure
as
this
case.
mr.
gill
deford
no,
it
doesn't,
and
i
think
that
might
be
a
hint
that
perhaps
the
moser
court
had
decided
to
reject
the
strict
analysis
in
merrill.
mr.
gill
deford
well,
six
members
of
the
merrill
majority
were
still...
were
on
the
moser
court
at
that
time.
i
would
like
to
direct
my--
mr.
gill
deford
--the
picco
case
was
a
criminal
case,
but
there's
been
no
indication,
other
than
the
statement
today
in
open
court,
that
that
should
make
any
difference.
picco
involved
a
for-profit
sophisticated
corporation
which
followed
exactly
what
mr.
merrill...
mr.
richmond
followed...
followed
what
the
agency
said
was
the
law,
whereas
in
fact
the
law
was
otherwise.
mr.
gill
deford
i
don't
think
that
should
make
any
difference,
justice
white,
based
on
the
government's
decision.
mr.
gill
deford
it
was
a
regulation
and
the
agency's
regulation
was
wrong,
as
this
court
determined.
and,
therefore,
the
court
held
that
the...
that
the
corporation
was
not
bound
by
what
the
law
actually
said.
it
was
only
bound
by
what
the
agency
had
said
the
law
was,
which
directly
contradicts
the
extreme
holding
in
merrill.
this
court
in
merrill
had
held
that
we
are
always
presumed
to
know
the
law
and,
therefore,
it
didn't
matter
what
you
heard
from
the
government
because
it's
what
you
are
presumed
to
know
which
counts.
and
picco
directly
contradicts
that
because
in
picco
they
followed
the
regulations
and
not
the
statute.
but
despite
that--
mr.
gill
deford
--well,
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
about
authorization.
this
information
came
from
the
office
of
personnel
management.
mr.
gill
deford
a
written
document.
i
believe
it
appears
in
the
appendix.
there's
no
dispute
about
where
the
information
came
from.
there's
never
been
any
real
factual
dispute
in
this
case
at
all,
as
to
what
happened
and
why
it
happened.
mr.
gill
deford
the
veto...
the
president's
of
the
law
was
overridden?
mr.
gill
deford
i
think
in
that
instance
you'd
have
some
major
separations
of
powers
problems
between
congress
and
the
executive.
mr.
gill
deford
i
think
if
they
had
vested
rights
to
those
benefits
they
should
win.
and
that's
the
crucial
distinction
here
between
this
and
numerous
other
cases--
mr.
gill
deford
--i
would
not
think
that...
that
congress
would
allow
that
kind
of
regulation
to
remain
available
for
very
long.
you're
talking
about
a
very
public
event.
this
was
something
which
was
going
on
behind
the
scenes
here.
mr.
gill
deford
your
honor,
you're
talking
about
the
executive
acting
intentionally
to
violate
the
will
of
congress.
that's
not
what
happened
here.
this
was
a
mistake,
a
serious
mistake,
by
the
executive
agency,
helped
by
the
judiciary
in
order
to
effectuate
the
ultimate
will
of
congress.
mr.
gill
deford
no.
your
honor,
i'm
simply
saying--
mr.
gill
deford
--in
the
intentional
situation
there
would
be
much
more
publicity
about
what...
about
what
had
happened.
estoppel
is
a
case-by-case
individualistic
kind
of
situation.
it
only
arises
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
that's
the
very
nature
of
it.
it's
an
equitable
concept.
i
think
if
the
president
were
to
violate
directly
the
will
of
congress,
you'd
have
a
somewhat
different
situation.
but
i
agree
that
ultimately
people
who
relied
on
what
the
president
did
could
achieve
some
sort
of
remedy
if
they
had
a
vested
right
in
those
benefits.
mr.
gill
deford
i
would
distinguish
a
vested
right,
your
honor,
by
pointing
to
the
hansen
case,
which
was
a
decision
of
this
court
in
1971
involving
someone
who
sought
social
security
benefits
and
was
told
that
she
wasn't
eligible
and
she
shouldn't
bother
to
apply.
she
didn't
apply,
and
as
a
consequence,
she
was
deprived
of
a
year
more
of
social
security
benefits.
she
had
no
vested
right
to
those
benefits
until
she
applied.
she
was
not
entitled
to
them.
that's
what
this
court
held
in
effect.
that
she
had
no
substantive
vested
right
to
those
benefits.
mr.
richmond
was
entitled
at
all
times.
from
1981
on,
he
had
a
vested
right
to
the
benefits.
mr.
gill
deford
if
it
involved
people
who
had
a
vested
right
at
that
time--
mr.
gill
deford
--well,
i...
the
hypothetical
wasn't...
i
did
not
understand
the
hypothetical
to
be
explained
in
such
detail
as
to
involve
or
not
involve
vested
rights.
mr.
gill
deford
but
somebody
who
was
already
entitled
and
receiving
those
benefits
would
definitely
have
a
vested
right,
as
did
mr.
richmond.
mr.
gill
deford
i
would
say
that
if
they
had
a
vested
right,
if
they
had
relied--
mr.
gill
deford
--i
think
those
people
who
relied,
yes,
would
be
able
to
achieve
an
estoppel
in
that
respect.
mr.
gill
deford
he
was
already
eligible,
justice
white.
mr.
gill
deford
well,
he...
he...
when
the
office
of
personnel
management--
mr.
gill
deford
--yes.
it
was
an
administrative
proceeding.
the
office
of
personnel
management
said,
we
are
depriving
you
of
your
annuity
for
six
months.
he
appealed
that
to
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
a
judge
there
turned
him
down.
the
board
turned
him
down.
he
then
went
to
the
federal
circuit
on
direct
appeal
from
the
merit
systems
protection
board.
mr.
gill
deford
that's
correct.
they
sent
him
a
letter
which
said,
you
earned
more
than
80
percent
in
one
year,
under
the
law
you
lose
your
annuity
for
the
next
six
months
or
until
you
no
longer
have
that
earnings
record.
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
why
in
this
case
the
traditional
elements
of
estoppel
are
applicable.
in
the
last
four
or
five
cases
that
this
court
has
dealt
with
in
the
estoppel
area,
it
has
declined
to
reach
the
issue
of
whether
the
government
could
be
estopped
because
it
found
that
traditional
elements
for
estoppel
were
not
there
or,
also,
the
element
of
affirmative
misconduct,
which
this
court
has
discussed.
in
this
case,
all
the
traditional
elements
are
there
and
affirmative
misconduct
is
there.
so,
this
case
is
different
than
the
estoppel
cases
which
the
court
has
dealt
with
over
the
last
20
years.
mr.
gill
deford
in
the
schweiker
v.
hansen
case?
mr.
gill
deford
one,
that
involved
a
low-level
employee
giving
information...
giving
oral...
giving
one
oral
response
to
an
individual
who
was
not
vested
in
benefits.
in
this
case,
the
information
came
from
the
agency
itself.
mr.
gill
deford
well,
there
has
been
a
dispute
here
about...
about
reasonable
reliance.
but
if
you're
speaking
of
affirmative
misconduct,
which
is
the
other
element
that
this
court
has
suggested
must
be
shown
for
estoppel
against
the
government,
the
affirmative
misconduct
here,
as
opposed
to
in
the
schweiker
v.
hansen
case,
is
that
it
came
from
the
agency.
it
was
the
agency
who
gave
out
the
wrong
information,
not
the
low-level
employee.
mr.
gill
deford
i
think
the
distinction,
your
honor,
is
that
in
hansen
it
was
one
person
coming
in
asking
a
question,
there
was
some
confusion
as
to
the
nature
of
the
question,
as
to
the
issues.
the
individual
employee
gave
out
an
answer,
the
individual
was
not
following
the
policy
of
the
agency.
affirmative
misconduct
has
generally
been
interpreted
by
the
lower
courts
as
requiring
something
more
than
mere
negligence.
and
i
think
what
took
place
in
the
hansen
case
was
mere
negligence
by
one
employee.
what
took
place
in
this
case
was
something
greater.
in
fact,--
mr.
gill
deford
--no.
i'm
saying
that
reckless...
it
was
not
intentional
misconduct
in
this
case,
as
far
as
we
know.
but
it
at
least
rose
to
the
level
of
recklessness
behavior.
it
was--
mr.
gill
deford
--greater
than
negligence.
mr.
gill
deford
i
think
the
distinction
is
that
here
it
was
the
agency
which
misbehaved,
which
sent
out
the
wrong
information
and
which
left
it
out
there
for
very
many
years.
in
hansen,
it
was
a
one
time
only
mistake
responding
to
one
question
from
one
individual.
i
do
want
to
speak
to
the
traditional
elements
of
estoppel
because
that
has
often
proven
to
be
a
problem
in
obtaining
an
estoppel
from
this
court.
the
government
admits
that
most
of
the
elements
of
traditional
estoppel
are
met
here.
there
was
reliance,
there
was
a
misrepresentation,
and
there
was
detriment
to
the
person
who
relied
on
that
misrepresentation.
the
only
dispute
here
on
the
traditional
elements
is
whether
or
not
the
behavior
was
reasonable,
whether
mr.
richmond
was
reasonable
in
relying
on
what
the
opm
letter
told
him.
the
government,
in
fact,
does
not
dispute
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
reliance
was
reasonable.
their
entire
argument
is
based
on
a
legal
fiction.
it's
based
on
the
legal
fiction
that
everyone
is
presumed
to
know
the
law.
and
i
think
even
more
important,
it's
based
on
a
corollary
to
that
legal
fiction
which
is
that
reliance
on
what
the
government
tells
you
is
always
unreasonable.
and
the
government
as
much
as
says
that
in
its
briefs.
that
since
we
are
all
presumed
to
know
the
law,
therefore,
you
can
never
rely
on
what
the
government
tells
you.
and
that
is
the
basis
for
the
government's
argument
in
this
case
that
mr.
richmond--
mr.
gill
deford
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i'm...
i'm
speaking
to
that
now
because
that
has
proven
to
be
a
problem
in
past
cases
before
this
court.
now,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
in
the
merrill
case
this
court
did
use
a
very
strict
interpretation
of
that
presumed
to
know
maxim.
it
received
a
fairly
sarcastic
dissent
from
justice
jackson,
but
that
was
the
decision
of
the
merrill
case,
we
are
all
presumed
to
know
the
law.
but
since
then,
that
has
been
severely
undercut
in
several
decisions
by
this
court.
by
the
moser
case,
by
the
picco
case...
in
both
of
those
instances
the
law
was
out
there,
it
was
available
to
the
individuals,
and
they
were
not
presumed
to
know
the
law.
the
court
in
effect
found
estoppel
and
found
that
they
had
reasonably
relied
even
though
theoretically
they
could
have
found
out
what
the
law
was.
i
think
more
important
is
this
court's
1984
decision
in
community
health
services.
in
that
decision,
the
court
found
that
the
institution
involved
had
not
reasonably
relied,
but
it
did
not
simply
say,
well,
you
should
have
known
what
the
law
is
and,
therefore,
your
reliance
was
unreasonable.
the
court
thoroughly
went
through
the
four
or
five
factors
which
demonstrated
in
that
case
that
that
institution
had
not
reasonably
relied.
it
was
a
totality
of
circumstances
type
of
analysis.
and
i
think
that's
the
appropriate
type
of
analysis
that
should
be
used
whenever
we're
determining
whether
there
was
reasonable
reliance
on
a
misrepresentation
by
the
government.
i
suggested
earlier
one
problem
of
using
the
strict
presumed
to
know
rule
would
be
that
we
could
all
be
required
to
have
lawyers
every
time
we
call
up
any
government
agency.
i
think
perhaps
an
even
more
important
consequence
of
applying
that
strict
rule
would
be
to
erode
further
the
confidence
in
government.
if
every
citizen
knew
that
the
legal
fiction
is
that
we
are
all
presumed
to
know
the
law
and
that
it's
always
unreasonable
to
rely
on
the
government,
then
i
think
confidence
in
government
would
go
down
somewhat.
so
i
think
this
court
has
indicated
since
the
merrill
decision
that
reasonable
reliance
is
determined
based
on
the
facts
on
the
totality
of
circumstances
and
not
merely
on
some
maxim
which
no
longer
has
any
validity.
in
this
case
there
should
be
no
doubt
that
mr.
richmond
did
reasonably
rely.
he
went
to
his
former
employer,
he
went
to
the
division
of
the
navy
which
had
always
handled
his
retirement,
which
had
dealt
with
the
issue
in
the
past.
he
asked
specific
questions.
he
asked
them
what...
i've
got
this
opportunity
for
short-term
work,
will
it
have
any
effect
on
my
continued
annuity?
he
asked
specific
questions
and
he
received
a
specific
written
explanation
in
response
to
those
questions.
it
was
an
unambiguous
statement
saying,
"you
may
earn
over
80
percent
for
one
year
as
long
as
you
do
not
earn
over
80
percent
in
the
next
year.
"
and
he
received
that
from
the
responsible
agency,
from
the
office
of
personnel
management.
again,
i
can
only
emphasize
enough,
this
was
not
the
statement
of
a
low-level
navy
employee.
this
was
the
written
explanation
of
the
navy...
i...
of
the...
of
the
office
of
personnel
management.
i
think
if
you
put
all
these
factors
together,
there
should
not
be
much
doubt
that
mr.
richmond
was
reasonable
in
relying
on
the
information
which
he
was
given.
now,
the
other
factor
which
has
also
in
the
past
caused
this
court
not
to
reach
the
ultimate
issue
of
whether
there
could
be
estoppel
against
the
government
is
what
is
known
as
affirmative
misconduct.
it's
not
part
of
the
traditional
estoppel
issues.
this
court
has
suggested
that
if
there
can
be
estoppel,
there
must
also
be
affirmative
misconduct.
and
i
think
there's
good
logic
in
that.
there
is
some
tension,
as
obviously
this
discussion
has
indicated,
between
sovereign
immunity,
separation
of
powers,
and
the
concept
of
equitable
estoppel.
and
by
adding
this
additional
level
that
an
individual
must
demonstrate,
i
think
this
court
has
made
it
very
clear
that
it's
possible
for
that
tension
to
be
worked
out.
people
who
might
be
able
to
demonstrate
just
the
traditional
elements
of
estoppel
will
not
necessarily
be
able
to
show
affirmative
misconduct.
but
those
who
can
show
affirmative
misconduct,
will
have
demonstrated
that
they're
entitled
to
estoppel
against
the
government.
unfortunately,
like
many
equitable
terms,
affirmative
misconduct
has
not
been
clearly
defined.
but
i
think
that
is
the
nature
of
equity
in
general
and
that
is
the
nature
of
estoppel.
it's
a
balancing
test
to
determine
when
you
have
affirmative
misconduct.
at
a
minimum,
as
i
suggested,
it
does
require
more
than
negligence.
the
lower
courts
are
in
pretty
much
agreement
on
that.
the
court
below
and
many
commentators
have
suggested
the
level
of
reckless...
reckless
behavior.
and
i
think
that's
an
appropriate
level.
mr.
gill
deford
the
tort
claims
act
i
believe
bars
claims
for
misrepresentation
and
deceit.
mr.
gill
deford
it
would
include
both
negligent
and
intentional
misrepresentation.
and
if
i
could
speak
to
that,
justice
white.
the
tort
claims
act
would
cover
if
it
did
apply
to
deceit
or
negligent
misrepresentation...
would
apply
to
much
broader
kinds
of
cases
than
are
applicable
here.
for
instance,
the
hansen
case
would
be--
mr.
gill
deford
--would
be
covered
by
that.
so
i
think
that's
a
good
reason
why
we
should
continue
to
use
this
narrow
remedy
of
estoppel
and
not
compare
it
to
the...
to
the
tort
misrepresentation.
again,
let
me
emphasize
on
the
affirmative
misconduct
issue.
the
agency
here,
office
of
personnel
management,
had
a
special
obligation
and
that's
why
their
behavior
is...
is
especially
disturbing.
there
was
a
change
in
law
here.
it
was
a
change
in
1982.
mr.
richmond
and
others
had
retired
before
that,
in
1981.
they
knew
what
the
law
when
they
retired.
they
knew
what
they
could...
they
knew
what
they
had
to
do
to
continue
to
be
eligible.
they
had
vested
rights.
they
needed
information
when
the
law
changed
to
be
able
to
conform
their
conduct
in
the
future
if
they
had
an
opportunity
to
gain
more
work.
they
needed
to
know
what
the
law
required.
so,
it's
our
position
that
opm
had
a
special
obligation
to
these
people
to
notify
them
that
the
law
had
changed
and
there
was
a
very
easy
way
for
them
to
do
it.
the
government
in
its
reply
brief
in
note
12
points
out
that
every
year
the
office
of
personnel
management
sends
out
forms
to
all
its
disability
annuitants
asking
for
information
on
their
prior
year's
earnings.
all
that
opm
would
have
had
to
do
was
attach
to
that
form
or
stuff
in
that
envelope
a
little
note
saying
the
law
has
changed
from
a
two
year
earning
capacity
record
rule
to
a
one
year
earning
capacity
rule.
mr.
gill
deford
no.
mr.
gill
deford
no.
mr.
gill
deford
they
didn't
have...
they
did
not
have
to
do
that.
i'm
suggesting
they
could
have
done
that
and
it
would
have
resolved
things.
there
are
lots
of
other
things
they
could
have
done.
what
they
didn't
do,
though,
was
to
make
any
affirmative
effort
whatsoever
to
get
the
information
out
to
people.
in
fact--
mr.
gill
deford
--i'm
saying
at
a
minimum
they
had
a
duty
to
make
sure
that
the
right
information
was
available
to
anybody
who
sought
it.
mr.
gill
deford
no.
i
will...
i
will...
if
i
said
that,
that's
going
too
far.
they
had
an
affirmative
obligation
to
make
sure
people
knew
what
the
law
was,
especially
people
who
had--
mr.
gill
deford
--and
that
could
have
been
satisfied,
your
honor,
simply
by
putting
the
information
in
an
envelope
that
they
were
sending
out
anyhow.
but
it
could
also
have
been
satisfied
by
making
sure
that
the
right
information
was
available
in
offices--
mr.
gill
deford
--i
don't
think
the
navy...
i'm
not
sure--
mr.
gill
deford
--well,
then
mr.
richmond
presumably
would
have
gone
somewhere
else.
mr.
gill
deford
he
would
have
been
misrepresented
because
the
same
inaccurate
information
was
all
over
the
country.
that's
the
problem
we
have.
mr.
gill
deford
it's
not...
it's
not
necessarily
the
navy
we're
talking
about
here.
opm
had
that
bad
information
out
all
over
the
country
at
all
times
and
the
corrected
information
which
we've
just
found
out
about
this
week
in
the
government's
reply
brief...
that
corrected
information
did
not
pull
back
the
wrong
information.
mr.
gill
deford
yes.
mr.
gill
deford
i'm
suggesting
that
had
they
advised
them,
this
whole
problem
would
have
been...
would
have
been
avoided.
and
that
would
have
been
one
simple
solution.
i'm
not
suggesting
for
purposes
of
this
case
that
they
had
to
advise
each
person
individually,
although
that
would
have
been
an
easy
way
to
resolve
this.
mr.
gill
deford
i--
mr.
gill
deford
--well,
i
believe
it
was
1981--
mr.
gill
deford
--circular
brief--
mr.
gill
deford
--but
they
didn't
have
anything
out--
mr.
gill
deford
--they
didn't
have
anything
out
to
explain
that
that
law
was
no
longer
in
effect.
