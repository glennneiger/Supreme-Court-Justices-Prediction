justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
some
point
acts...
acts
of
government
officials
can
deprive
someone
of
a
constitutional
right
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
do?
is
that...
was
that
the
situation
in
picco
or
the
pennsylvania
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
that
had
been
just
a
civil
case
that
you
were
trying
to
recover
from...
from
that...
from
that
particular
party
the
costs
of
removing
some
obstruction
and
yet
the...
and
yet
the
party
had
been
affirmatively
misled
by
that
regulation?
do
you
think
the
result
would
have
been
different
if
that
would
have
been
a
civil
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
--would
the...
would
the
result
have
been
the
same
in
a
civil
case
as
in
a
criminal?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
couldn't...
you
couldn't
fine
him
on
the
criminal
case
but
you
could
make
him...
you
could
recover
a
large
sum
of
money
from
him
in
a
civil
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
you
can
make
the
argument
then
about
some
of
these...
about
a
lot
of
these
programs
would
be...
could
be
put
up
in
constitutional
terms.
just...
you're
making
a...
you're
making
a
claim
here
that's
just
wrong
and
if...
you're
making
a
claim
for
money
that's
never
been
appropriated.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
argument--
justice
byron
r.
white
--isn't
that
the
money
isn't
appropriated
really.
the
argument
is
that
they're
just...
that--
--it
wasn't
properly--
--well,
the
money's
been
appropriated
for
a
specific
purpose
and
if
they
pay
it
out,
why,
that's
out
for
that
purpose.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
the
only
reason
this
case
comes
up
is
that
the...
is
that
the...
well,
i
guess
there's
plenty
of
reasons,
but
one
reason
that
would
eliminate
a
case
like
this
is
if
the
federal
tort
claims
act
covered
negligent
misrepresentation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you--
justice
byron
r.
white
--think
that
congress
could
solve
this
xx
of
a
problem
by
saying
if
there's
a
negligent
misre,
sentation,
you
can
pay
out
money
that
we've
never
author.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
suppose
congress
has
rejected
the
notion
that
they...
that
there
should
be
some
recovery
for
negligent
misrepresentation.
affirmatively
it
said
so.
justice
byron
r.
white
sounds
like
he
had
a
bad
lawyer.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
lawyer
probably
would
have
asked
the
navy
anyway,
wouldn't
he?
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
this
should
have
been
a
class
action.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about...
what
about
picco?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
the
agency
had
said
it
in
a
regulation.
justice
byron
r.
white
but...
but
that
was
the
case,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
the
government
has
never
claimed
in
this
case
that
the
person
that
gave
the
advise
wasn't
seemingly
authorized
to
give
such
advise?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
was
a
written--
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
this
case
get
started?
did
he
apply
for--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
know,
but
how
did
it
get
to
the
merit...
the
merits
board?
what
did
he
do?
did
he--
justice
byron
r.
white
--this
got
started
in
an
administrative
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
that...
that...
they
just
notified
him
that
they
were
stopping
his--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if...
if
estoppel
is
available
at
all,
that's
their
argument.
justice
byron
r.
white
does
the
tort
claims
act
just
bar
any
claim
of
recklessness?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
negligent
misrepresentation
or
just--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
i
understand
that.
