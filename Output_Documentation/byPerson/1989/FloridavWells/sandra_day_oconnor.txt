mr.
neimand,
when
did
the
search
occur?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
year
and
what
month?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
at
that
time,
as
a
legal
proposition,
how
much
discretion
did
the
police
officer
have
to
open
closed
containers
during
the
course
of
an
inventory
search?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
no,
no,
no.
as
a
matter
of
local
law
and
procedure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
does
the
testimony
show
the
policy
was
with
regard
to
opening
locked
containers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there's
no
court
finding
below--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
what
the
policy
was.
so
we
simply
don't
know.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
there
some
discretion
there
to
open
a
locked
container,
or
not,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
concern,
of
course,
is
to
avoid
pretextual
searches
for
evidence.
here
there
was
some
testimony
that
the
officer
conducting
the
search
suspected
there
had
to
be
marijuana
in
the
car,
and
the
opening
of
the
suitcase
was
in
an
effort
to
locate
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
if
the
officer
listed
on
the
inventory
a
locked
suitcase,
would
the
officer
be
in
violation
of
the
applicable
state
inventory
policy,
subject
to
discipline
because
he
listed
it
that
way
on
the
inventory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
florida
court
apparently
was
referring
to
the
highway
patrol
policy
manual,
chapter
16?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uh-huh.
we
have
something
on
our
desks
this
afternoon,
lodged,
i
guess,
by
your
opponent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
indicating
that
it
wasn't
in
effect
at
that
time.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet
the
court,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
found
there
was
no
firm
policy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
if
they
had
looked
at
the
oral
policy
they
would
have
found
that
it
was
firm
and
sufficient?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
aren't
you
liable,
as
you
put
it,
for
returning
one
locked
suitcase
in
the
condition
in
which
you
received
it?
what
is
the
matter
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
is
an
ability
to
file
a
lawsuit
in
any
scenario.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
prevented
the
officer
from
getting
a
search
warrant
to
open
the
suitcase
here?
