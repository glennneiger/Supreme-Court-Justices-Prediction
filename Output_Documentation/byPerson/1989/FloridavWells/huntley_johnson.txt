mr.
huntley
johnson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
here
is
much
more
basic
than
the
state
of
florida
would
have
us
believe.
the
question
is,
is
was
this
an
inventory
procedure
at
all.
and
the
answer
is
no.
and
the
answer
is
no
is
because
there
was
no
inventory
form,
and
a
close
study
of
the
record
will
show
that
indeed
trooper
adams
did
not
have
any
idea
what
was
in
the
car.
and
i
would
like
to
refer
to
two
places
in
the
joint
appendix
to
prove
that
up,
if
i
could.
at
page
217
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
trial
counsel
is
questioning
trooper
adams.
question:
all
right,
did
you
look
in
the
trunk
first?
now,
this
is
his
full
answer:
we
opened
the
trunk
and
that
was
it.
what
was
in
the
trunk?
oil
cans
and
a
suitcase.
that
is
the
trooper
trying
to
recall
what
was
in
the
trunk.
question:
what?
answer:
a
couple
of
oil
cans,
an
oil
can,
a
can
of
oil,
or
something
like
that,
and
a
suitcase.
that
is
at
the
motion
to
suppress
before
the
trial
judge
in
this
case,
and
my
opponent
would
have
you
believe
that
the
trial
judge
did
not
address
the
issue
of
the
inventory
in
this
case.
please
look
at
page
221,
in
which
the
argument
is
before
the
trial
court,
and
the
court
says
well,
it
really
would
appear
to
me
that
the
thrust
of
the
defense
argument
here
is
as
contained
in
the
motions,
as
contained
in
his
memorandum,
statement
of
facts,
and
is
indicated
by
the
line
of
questioning
that
he
made
of
the
witness,
is
that
the
trooper's
main
interest
was
not
inventorying,
but
searching
for
contraband.
clearly
it
was
addressed.
the
first
document
in
the
joint
appendix
is
the
motion
to
suppress
in
this
case.
it
has
got
70-something
paragraphs
in
it,
and
the
thrust
of
it,
it
goes
to
several
things,
but
the
inventory
search
is
certainly
one
of
them.
question
as
to
whether
this
was
an
inventory
or
a
search,
on
page
49
of
the
joint
appendix,
this
is
the
sworn
deposition
of
trooper
adams,
which
was
admitted
by
the
trial
judge
as
part
of
the
record
because
of
the
fact
that
he
did
not
want
us
to
go
over,
did
not
want
trial
counsel
to
go
over
items
that
had
already
been
covered
in
the
sworn
depositions.
question
by
trial
counsel:
did
you
see
any
empty
beer
cans
or
beer
bottles
in
the
car?
answer:
i
can't
recall
any.
well,
you
at
some
point
did
inventory
the
car.
answer:
i
did.
and
if
you
had--
but
that
has
been
awhile
since
i
did
that,
and
if
there
was
a
beer
can
in
there
i
can't
remember
if
there
was
or
not.
okay.
i--
mr.
huntley
johnson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
huntley
johnson
your
honor,
the
supreme
court
of
florida
was
unfortunately
under
a
misguided
set
of
circumstances
in
that--
mr.
huntley
johnson
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
huntley
johnson
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
huntley
johnson
yes,
i
do,
and
i
would
like
to
expand
on
that,
if
i
could,
sir.
the
chief
counsel
for
the
florida
highway
patrol
filed
an
amicus
curiae
in
1987
in
which,
this
is
after
the
fifth
dca,
the
lower
appellate
court
in
florida
had
ruled
three
to
nothing
in
favor
of
the
respondent
in
this
case.
the
amicus
curiae
was
filed,
in
which
they
relied
on
chapter
16
of
the
florida
highway
patrol
manual.
chapter
16
of
the
florida
highway
patrol
manual
was
not
in
effect
at
all
on
february
11,
1985,
when
trooper
adams
went
into
the
car
of
mr.
wells,
went
into
the
trunk
and
into
the
suitcase,
the
locked
suitcase.
the
locked
suitcase,
which
should
have
had
a
higher
expectation
of
privacy.
it
wasn't
in
effect,
and
unfortunately
the
supreme
court
was
misled
because
of
that.
no
one
picked
it
up
along
the
way.
none
of
the
appellate
lawyers,
none
of
the
clerks,
none
of
the
court,
in
the
supreme
court,
but
that
issue
never
came
up
until
it
was
interjected
by
the
counsel
for
the
troopers.
it
was
not
in
effect.
so
what
we
have
to
look
at,
under
bertine
and
after...
under
the
decision
of
florida,
and
the
cases
before
bertine,
is
was
there
any
standard
caretaking
procedure
that
guided
this
trooper
in
this
case.
the
testimony
goes
to
that
point
on
page
82
of
the
joint
appendix.
question:
have
you
ever
applied
for
a
search
warrant?
answer:
no.
can
you
think
of
a
set
of
circumstances
under
which
you
might
apply
for
a
search
warrant
when
it
involves
a
vehicle?
well,
at
this
time
i
thought
that
would
be
appropriate,
a
search
warrant
would
be
appropriate,
but
based
on
what
we
had
here,
and
it
was
part
of
the
search,
i
figured
it
was
part
of
the
search,
and
i
didn't
see
where
it
need
be.
on
page
83,
question:
when
did
it
first
occur
to
you
that
maybe
a
search
warrant
would
be
appropriate?
answer:
while
i
was
doing
the
search.
but
like
i
said,
i
felt
like
opening
the
suitcase
would
come
under
the
inventory
search
of
the
vehicle.
this
trooper
had
no
guidelines.
question
below
that
on
page
83.
even
though
it
was
locked
and
you
had
to
use
knives
to
pry
it
open?
answer:
well,
i
had
to
take
my
chances.
and
the
reason,
your
honors,
that
he
had
to
take
his
chances,
is
because
he
had
no
procedures
to
guide
him
whatsoever.
these...
this
manual
came
into
effect
july
1,
1985,
four-and-a-half
months
after
this
search
took
place.
prior
to
that
there
was
no
written--
mr.
huntley
johnson
--your
honor--
mr.
huntley
johnson
--your
honor,
we
have
searched
the
record
thoroughly
since,
unfortunately,
this
last
thursday
night,
that
in
a
conversation--
mr.
huntley
johnson
--excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
huntley
johnson
that
is
because
last
thursday
night
we
noticed
that
in
the
record
there
has
never
been
a
date
as
to
when
the
florida--
mr.
huntley
johnson
--your
honor,
i
knew
that
it
was
not
going
to
make
us
look
good
coming
up
here,
but
the
point
was
it
is
something
we
just
discovered
thursday.
we
wanted
to
put
it
before
the
court
in
good
faith.
at
no
point
has
any
date
ever
appeared
in
any
opinion,
any
brief,
as
to
when
those
formal
rules
went
into
effect.
and
those
are
the
rules
that
the
florida
supreme
court
unfortunately
was
relying
on
when
they
wrote
the
opinion,
both
the--
mr.
huntley
johnson
--i
think
the
case
should
be
remanded,
to
be
candid,
your
honor.
i
think
the
florida
supreme
court
was
operating
under
absolutely
the
wrong
guidelines.
but,
if
this
court
wishes
to
reach
to
whether
the
guidelines
in
this
case
were
sufficient,
i
think
the
record
speaks
aptly
to
that.
but
i
agree
that
this
case
should
be
remanded,
your
honor,
and
give
the
state
of
florida
a
chance
to
clear
up
the
mess
it
has
made
by
the
fact
that
it
went
off
on
something
that
was
not
in
fact
the
record
that
it
should
have
been
relying
on
when
it
made
this
decision.
so
i
do
agree
with
that,
sir.
now--
mr.
huntley
johnson
--that
would
be
closer,
but
i
don't
care
for
that
personally,
your
honor.
i
think
that
is
too
intrusive
to
go
in
in
that
fashion.
i
think
it
should
be
simply
inventory
everything.
mr.
huntley
johnson
period.
or--
mr.
huntley
johnson
--yes,
sir.
but
i
do
agree
there
should
be
a
modicum
of
discretion.
if,
for
example,
a
state
wishes
to
limit
that
which
can
be
gone
into
under
these
circumstances,
in
an
inventory
search,
then
i
think
there
still
should
be
just
some
discretion
with
the
police.
because,
if
you
have
in
your
suitcase
a
ticking
clock
that
suggests
to
an
officer
that
that
may
be
a
bomb,
then
certainly
i
wouldn't
want
to
preclude
him
from
that
kind
of
discretion,
your
honor.
i
am
not
trying
to
suggest
a
rule
that
becomes
so
firm
and
so
inflexible,
in
either
direction,
searching
everything
or
searching
a
very
limited
number
of
things--
mr.
huntley
johnson
--i
think
that
under
special
exigencies,
if
you
will,
as
were
spoken
about
in--
mr.
huntley
johnson
--no,
under
a
special
exigency
you
could
then
open,
because
the
special
exigency
would
be
a
legitimate
danger
to
the
police
or
to
the
citizenry
by,
for
example,
the
ticking
bomb.
mr.
huntley
johnson
no,
sir.
mr.
huntley
johnson
no.
either
you
make
it
that
firm,
that
you
have
to
open
them
all,
or,
if
you
try,
if
some
law-making
agency
comes
back
and
tries
to
draw
a
line
somewhere
short
of
opening
all
containers,
then,
at
that
point,
sir,
i
am
saying
that
some
discretion
should
be
available
to
the
police
officer
when
there
is
a
special
exigency
as
i
just
suggested...
a
ticking
bomb
for
example.
mr.
huntley
johnson
no,
i
think
that
would
be...
well,
you
would
call
the
bomb
squad
at
that
point,
if
that
is
what
you
mean.
mr.
huntley
johnson
meaning
no
discretion,
your
honor?
mr.
huntley
johnson
i
would
think
that
under
the
concept
of
federalism
that
that
would
be
a
possibility,
your
honor.
that
the
states
could
choose
to
handle
it
in
different
ways,
as
long
as
it
satisfied
this
court
that
the
minimums
of
the
fourth
amendment
had
been
adhered
to,
sir.
mr.
huntley
johnson
no,
it
is
not,
your
honor,
and
i
have
great
difficulty
with
their
opinion.
obviously
they
ruled
in
favor
of
the
respondent
in
this
case,
but
we
don't
necessarily
think
for
the
right
reasons.
the
fact
that
they
said
absolutely
no
discretion,
i
think
is
too
far,
and
i
have
tried
to
explain
why
by
the
fact
that
there
is,
there
are
circumstances
under
which
discretion
should
be
appropriate.
mr.
huntley
johnson
well,
the
opperman
doctrine,
yes,
sir,
would
be
the
situation
we
are
suggesting,
your
honor.
and
that,
i
think
that
the
standards
set
down
by
opperman
are
good
standards.
and
i
think
that
those
standards
were
in
effect
on
february
11,
1985
when
trooper
adams
took
his
chances
and
went
into
that
suitcase.
and
if
we
could
speak
to
trooper
adams'
actions
that
night,
it's
important
to
note
that
in
the
dissent
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida's
opinion,
they
talk
about
the
fact
that
he
was
under
the
guidance
of
his
superior
officers
while
he
was
in
the
field,
that
he
was
checking
back
with
them.
that
is
true
at
the
initial
stop
site.
at
the
initial
stop
site
trooper
adams
asks
his
supervisor,
what
do
i
do
with
the
money,
what
do
i
do
with
the
car.
then
the
car
goes
off
in
one
direction
to
the
impoundment
site.
the
trooper
and
mr.
wells
go
off
to
jail.
and
trooper
adams,
who,
by
the
way,
was
only
working
the
3:00
to
11:00
p.m.
shift,
at
1:30
a.m.
he
shows
up
at
the
inventory
site,
at
the
impoundment
center,
which
has
been
described
by
mr.
bryan
in
the
deposition
at
page
140
as
a
very
secure
facility.
he
wakes
up
mr.
bryan;
there
is
also
another
security
guard.
they
have
dogs,
they
have
lights,
they
have
fences.
wakes
him
up.
they
go
into
the
trunk
of
the
car,
get
out
the
suitcase,
and
at
no
time
does
trooper
adams
call
back
and
ask
for
any
guidance
from
his
superiors.
at
that
point
he
is
on
his
own,
and
he
is
taking
his
chances.
and
it's
very
important
to
get
to
the
bad
faith
here,
to
go
to
what
grover
bryan,
the
disinterested
tow
truck
operator,
and
what
he
testifies
trooper
adams
says
when
he
gets
to
the
inventory
site.
on
page
141
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
question
by
the
trial
counsel
was,
now,
if
you
could,
with
as
much
detail
as
you
can
recall,
tell
me
what
occurred
between
you
and
adams,
what
he
said,
what
you
said,
and
what
you
all
did
as
a
result
of
the
conversation?
answer:
officer
adams
said
he
wanted
to
inventory
the
car
good.
he
wanted
to
go
through
it
real
good
because
he
felt
there
was
drugs
in
it.
that
is
before
this
car
is
let
down
out
of
the
sling
of
the
tow
truck.
because
grover
bryan
testifies
he
left
the
car
hanging
in
the
sling.
mr.
huntley
johnson
if
there
is
bad
faith
and
the
sole
purpose
is
to
investigate--
mr.
huntley
johnson
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
a
violation
under
bertine,
as
i
read
it,
wherein
the
opinion
talks
about--
mr.
huntley
johnson
--bad
faith
or,
and
for
the
sole
purpose
of
investigating.
in
fact--
mr.
huntley
johnson
--well,
justice--
mr.
huntley
johnson
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
would
suggest
that
if
he
had
been
inventorying
at
all,
as
has
been
pointed
out
by
the
question
from
justice
stevens,
we
would
have
some
list.
lafayette
talks
about
an
inventory
being
the
making
of
a
list.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
we
have
no
list,
we
have
no
recollection,
and
when
a
trooper
is
under
oath,
if
we
want
to
talk
about
common
sense,
your
honor,
he
certainly
would
be
looking
at
the
list
that
he
had
of
the
items
when
being
asked
the
questions
about
what
was
in
the
car.
and
he
talks
about
remembering
an
oil
can,
but
he
can't
remember
if
there
are
beer
cans.
there
is
no
list;
there
has
never
been
a
list.
and
to
this
day
we
have
no
list.
in
this
particular
case
the
respondent's
position
is
this
was
not
a
routine
administrative
procedure.
this
was
an
investigation
from
the
very
beginning.
at
page
204
of
the
joint
appendix,
when
trooper
adams
stops...
well,
what
happens
is
he
stops
him
for
dui,
stops
mr.
wells
for
dui.
he
gives
him
the
roadside
field
sobriety
tests,
and
he
says
all
right,
i
am
going
to
take
you
down
to
the
station
for
the
breathalyzer
examination.
at
that
point
mr.
wells
says
could
i
get
a
jacket
out
of
my
car,
because
of
the
fact
that
it
is
cold.
they
go
to
mr.
wells'
car,
and
there
is
money
on
the
floorboard.
at
that
point,
so
as
to
guide
as
to
whether
we
are
in
an
investigation
or
an
inventory,
at
that
point
the
trooper
is
asked,
on
the
bottom
of
203,
the
last
question,
okay,
now
you
see
the
jacket,
you
see
the
money.
what
do
you
do
at
that
point?
at
that
point
i
asked
him
to
step
back
from
the
car.
i
investigated
the
vehicle
myself.
and--
investigate.
can
you
clarify
for
the
court
what
that
means?
in
other
words,
i
checked
to
see
how
much
money
is
there,
how
it
is,
you
know,
the
money,
what
else
is
there
in
the
vehicle
and
such.
that
is
about
it.
and
the
next
answer
he
talks
about
he
was
looking
for
as
far
as
any
other
contraband
other
than
money.
right...
right
from
the
very
beginning,
trooper
adams
is
looking
for
contraband.
as
soon
as
he
gets
to
the
inventory
site
he
makes
it
clear
to
the
disinterested
tow
truck
drivers
that
he
is
looking
for
drugs.
he
never
makes
a
list.
this
trooper
is
in
bad
faith.
we
ask
this
court
to
send
this
case
back
to
florida
so
that
florida
can
straighten
out
the
mess
that
we
caused
by
sending
it
up
here
in
the
first
place.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
huntley
johnson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
huntley
johnson
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
your
honor.
if
the
overall
totality
of
the
circumstances
is
such
that
the
conduct
is
reasonable
of
the
officer,
then
i
think
the
answer
to
your
question
is
no,
your
honor.
mr.
huntley
johnson
thank
you,
your
honor.
