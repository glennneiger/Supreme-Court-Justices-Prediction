justice
antonin
scalia
that
sounds
like
a
very
good
rule,
but
how
do
we
know
that
was
the
rule
that
indeed
was
in
force
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then,
we
can't
possibly
affirm
the
case,
or
reverse
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
assert
that
in
order
to
sustain
the
search
it...
the
lower
court
would
have
to
find
what?
that
it
was
the
policy
at
the
time
to
open
all
closed
containers,
or
just
those
closed
containers
that
seemed
likely
to
contain
valuable
personal
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
position
is
that
you
lose
unless
it
is
their
procedure
to
open
every
container?
every
container.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
find
a
bottle
of,
it
looks
like
a
bottle
of
coca-cola,
you
have
to
open
it
and
make
sure
it's
coca-cola?
inventory
one
bottle
of
coca-cola,
now
flat.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
or
a
bottle
of
1873,
it
looks
like
wine,
it
is
1873
chateauneauf
du
pape.
you
have
to
pull
the
cork
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
really--
justice
antonin
scalia
every
container
is
likely
to
contain
personal
property,
isn't
it?
that's
what
a
container
is
for,
to
contain.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that
is
a
very
strict
rule.
i
can't
imagine
that
any
police,
police
force
in
the...
i
hope
no
police
force
in
the
country,
if
they
happen
to
have
to
impound
my
car,
are
going
to,
you
know,
open
the
valuable
wine
bottles
that
i
have
in
there
and
destroy
the
wine.
i
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
then
they
don't
have
to
open
every
container.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
to
allow
some
discretion.
you
are
saying
it
is
not
an
absolute
requirement
that
you
look
inside
every
container.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
limitation
that
you
are
applying?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
what
is
the
criterion?
when
do
you
say
i
don't
have
to
open
any
further?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
probable
cause
prevented
him
from
getting
a
search
warrant.
are
you
sure
he
had
probable
cause
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
mean
after
he
found
it
he
had
probable
cause.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
johnson,
just
in
case
we
get
to
the
point,
if...
what
kind
of
guidelines
do
you
think
would
be
sufficient?
suppose...
suppose
florida
just
had
guidelines
which
said
open
every
container...
in
making
the
inventory
search,
open
every
container
that
appears
likely
to
contain
valuable
personal
property.
would
that
be
enough
to
validate
the
search
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
open
all...
all
containers.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
agree
there
can
be
some
discretion
as
to
whether--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
special
exigencies
you
can
decline
to
open.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
the
only
constitutional
role
is
you
can
never
open
containers?
i
thought
we
were
talking
about
an
inventory--
justice
antonin
scalia
--rule
that
says
you
must
always
open
containers.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
would
be
discretion
not
to
open.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
is
not
a
violation
of
our...
of
our
rules.
so,
if
you
do
have
an
inventory
procedure,
the
fact
that
the
real
reason
you
want
to
apply
it
is
because
you
think...
you
think
you
can
find
evidence
of
crime
is
not
a
violation,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
bad
faith.
if
i
have
a...
i
am
compelled
to
inventory.
now,
frankly,
i
think
doing
an
inventory
is
a
terrible
job
as
a
cop,
it
is
just
more
paperwork
and
what
not.
the
real
reason
i
want
to
do
this
one
is
because
i
know
i
am
going
to
find
drugs
in
that
car.
that
is
a
violation?
i
mean,
you
are
going
to
have
to
repeal
human
nature
if
you
expect
law
enforcement
officers
not
to
have
that
feeling.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was
an
objective
test.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not
the
sole
purpose
of
investigating.
he...
he
had...
if
he
has
an
obligation
to
do
an
inventory,
he's
doing
that.
but
the
real
reason
he
wants
to
do
it,
in
his
heart
of
hearts,
is
he
thinks
he
is
going
to
find
something
bad.
and
that,
that's
what
that
quote
indicated.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
reason
i
want
to
inventory
it
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
johnson,
could
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
you
are
not
interested
in
these
points,
but
it
is
the
reason
we
took
the
case,
and
maybe
we'll
get
to
them.
is
discretion,
which
we
have
said
is
no
good
with
respect
to
inventory
searches,
is
discretion
the
same
thing
as
judgment?
that
is
to
say,
when
i
tell
a
trooper
that
you
must
open
any
container...
you
must
open
any
container
that
is
likely
to
contain
private
property,
that
doesn't
give
him
any
discretion.
if
it's
likely
to
contain
it,
he
must
open
it.
but
it
does
put
it
in,
you
know,
he
has
to
exercise
some
judgment
in
determining
whether
it
contains
private
property.
and
i
would...
is
the
judgment,
does
that
invalidate
the
inventory
procedure
as
well?
