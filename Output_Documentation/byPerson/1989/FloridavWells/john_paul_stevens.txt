justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
in
this
case,
where
is
the
inventory
in
the
record?
is
it
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
they
did,
they
did
make
an
inventory
sheet?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
but
you
didn't
put
it
in
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
don't
know
whether
they
inventoried
the
contents
of
the
suitcase
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
defendant
didn't
rely
on
the,
opening
the
suitcase
in
the
trial
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
the
state's
theory
was
a
consent
theory?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
the,
did
the
defendant
in
the
trial
court
argue
that
the
search
of
the
suitcase
was
improper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
am
just
wondering
how
the
case
got
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say
argued
on
a
consent
issue,
you
mean
the
state
took
the
position
there
was
consent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
position
did
the...
did
the
defendant
take?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
yet,
and
in
defending
that
claim,
the
state
did
not
put
in
the
inventory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
just
said
valuable
personal
property.
earlier
you
said
the
policy
was
any
kind
of
a
container
that
might
reasonably
be
thought
to
contain
personal
property.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then
is
it
not
reasonable
to
assume
that
any
closed
container
contains
something?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
every
closed
container
would
reasonably
be
thought
to
contain
some
personal
property.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
would
mean
that...
does
that
mean
that
the
officer
has
discretion
in
every
case
to
open
or
not
to
open,
or
that
he
must
open
in
every
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
a
container
in
a
vehicle,
and
the
officer
finds
it.
does
he
have
discretion,
under
your
view
in
florida,
to
open
or
not
to
open
the
container?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
say
that,
how
do
you
reconcile
that
with
the
court's
statement
that
the
florida
highway
patrol
"operates
under
no
mandatory
standardized
policy
regarding
closed
containers?
"
you
are
saying
there
is
such
a
policy,
and
it
is
to
open
all
containers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
should
we
take
your
word
or
the
court's
word
on
this?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
have
seen
notebooks,
trial
notes
for
the
lawyers
or
something
like
that,
that
are
of
some
importance
to
the
lawyer.
it
may
have
20
pages
on
a
yellow
pad
or
something,
and
he
wants
not
to
lose
those.
it
could
be
very
important
to
the
person,
certain
pages
out
of
a
notebook.
if
you
are
worried
about...
why
don't
you
have
to
list
the
number
of
pages
in
the
notebook,
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
it
safeguarding
if
you
just
list
one
locked
briefcase
and
no
key?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
if
it
said
one
locked
briefcase
containing
three
diamond
rings,
and
they
come
in
later
and
the
three
diamond
rings
aren't
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
obviously
under
your
hypothesis,
somebody
broke
into
the
suitcase
and
emptied
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
indicate
whether
they
were
looking
for
more
evidence
of
criminal
activity,
or
were
they
looking
for
evidence
that
they
wanted
to
inventory
properly
so
they
wouldn't
be
sued
for
losing
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
he
even
wrote
down
what
he
found,
or
filed
an
inventory
or
anything--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
we
don't
know
what
it
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
has
the
burden
of
establishing
the
state's
practice
with
regard
to
inventories,
to
justify
an
inventory
search?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
failed
to
meet
that
burden
in
this
case,
and
you
say
you
want
to
go
back
and
try
the
case
over
so
you
can
meet
it
on
the
second
time,
is
what
you
are
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
view
of
discretion
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
they
will
find
evidence
of
criminal
activity.
it
is
discretion
to
avoid
explosions
and
things
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
also
suggest
this,
that
it
may
have
been
wrong
in
stating
that
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
procedures
that
would
be
permissible.
that
doesn't
mean
it
was
necessarily
wrong
in
its
outcome
in
the
particular
case.
that's
a
criticism
of
its
opinion,
not
necessarily
of
its
holding.
because
it
does
seem
clear
from
the
opinion
that
there
was
no
standardized
procedure
whatsoever
that
was
in
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
would
have
to
do
an
inventory
search.
but
there
is
nothing
in
there
that
says
he
either
had
any
duty
to
open
containers
or
duty
not
to
open
them.
there
is
nothing
in
the
procedures
he
described
that
told
him
what
to
do
when
he
confronted
a
closed
container.
