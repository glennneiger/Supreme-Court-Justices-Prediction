mr.
michael
j.
neimand
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
during
a
lawful
inventory
search
of
a
locked...
a
locked
suitcase
was
opened
for
inventory.
the
florida
supreme
court
suppressed
the
evidence
found
therein,
finding
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
that
the
scope
of
an
inventory
to
be
explicitly
stated.
florida
asked
this
court
to
hold
than
an
inventory
search
encompasses
the
entire
contents
of
the
vehicle,
including
closed
containers.
such
a
rule
of
law
will
be
incontinent
with
the
purposes
of
opperman
and,
as
we
affirm,
in
bertine.
that
is
to
satisfy
and
protect
the
property
of
the
individual
for
safekeeping,
and
the
police
from
false
claims
of...
and
due
to
loss
of
property.
the
scope
of
an
inventory
in
and
of
itself
states
that
you
are
to
catalogue
the
doc,
the
documents
and
the
property
found
within
the
car.
it
is
solely
to
areas
where
valuable
personal
property
would
attach.
in
the
case
before
the
court,
the
florida
supreme
court
found
that
there
was
a
good
faith
impoundment,
and
that
the
inventory
of
the
interior
of
the
car,
as
well
as
the
inventory
of
the
trunk,
was
lawful.
what
the
florida
supreme
court
found
then,
that
the
opening
of
the...
the
prying
open
of
the
locked
suitcase
to
inventory
that,
was
unlawful
and
violative
of
the
principles
announced
in
bertine,
because
it
held
that
bertine
required
standardized
procedures
listing
the
exact
nature
and
scope
of
an
inventory
search.
the
state
position
in
front
of
this
court
is
that
bertine
does
not
require
such
a
detailed
listing,
just
that
there
be
procedures,
whether
written
or
oral,
that
all
inventory...
all
impounded
cars
are
inventoried.
by
requiring
that
all
impounded
cars
are
inventoried,
this
will
take
away
the
evidentiary
discretion
that
this
court
has
so
declared
unconstitutional
in
its
previous
cases.
the
evidentiary
discretion
would
be
taken
away
because
every
car
would
then
be
subject
to
inventory.
the
inventory
would
then
be--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--the
actual
inventory
list?
no,
it's
not,
your
honor.
the
reason
it
is
not
in
the
record
is
because
of
the
history
of
this
case.
the
inventory
initially
was
declared
improper
because
it...
the
defendant
was
not
given
a
reasonable
opportunity
to
do
something
other
than
have
the
car
impounded,
in
other
words,
to
have
someone
drive
it
away
or
to
leave
it
on
the
street.
florida
is
a
fourth
amendment
state.
by
our
state
constitution
we
have
adopted--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
an
inventory
does
in
fact
exist.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
it
was
never
in
the
record,
no,
sir.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
we
do
not
know
if
it
is
on
the
inventory
sheet,
no.
we
do
not.
and
it
was
never
brought
out
below
because
that
was
never
at
issue
below.
the
original
issue
below
was
that
it
was
an
improper
impoundment,
in
the
lower
appellate
court.
in
the
florida
supreme
court,
this
court
had
then
issued
the
bertine
opinion,
which
then
said
there
need
not
be
a
reasonable
alternative
to
impoundment
in
order
to
make
the
inventory
proper.
so
at
that
point
in
time
was
the
first
time
that
any
court
discussed
the
reasonableness
of
the
inventory
itself.
so
therefore,
at
that
point
in
time
it
was
not
part
of
the
record
going
up.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
in
the
trial
court
the
theory
was
a
consent
theory.
that
the
officer
had
asked
him
may
i
look
in
the
trunk,
and--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--right.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
at
all...
i
really
don't
recall
if
he
explicitly
raised
that
issue,
at
this
point
in
time.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
it...
i,
that
is
how
i
will
explain
how
it
got
here,
because
when...
it
was
strictly
an
order
by
the
trial
court
saying
the
motion
to
suppress
is
denied.
after
it
was
argued
on
a
consent
issue,
as
well,
i
believe,
the
opening
of
the
suitcase
was
improper.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
i
believe
that
he
took
the
position
that
it
was
an
improper
inventory
search.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
no,
because
the
state
relied
strictly
on
the
consent
theory,
and
the
court
below,
the
trial
court
below
did
not
give
any
factual
findings
in
his
order.
he
simply
said
denied.
when
it
went
up
to
the
lower
appellate
court,
the
appellate
court
found
that
the
consent
was
too
broad,
and
they,
on
its
own
said
there
was
no
probable
cause.
and
then
on
the
inventory
aspect,
which
the
state
brought
up
at
that
point
in
time
to
try
and
defend,
indicated
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
opperman
and
our
state
court's
decisions,
then
that
was
an
improper
impoundment.
it
was
only
until
it
got
to
the
florida
supreme
court
that
the
actual
issue
of
inventory
was
brought
up,
because
at
that
point
in
time
this
court's
decision
in
bertine
had
changed
the
law
requiring
a
reasonable
alternative
toward
impoundment.
and
at
that
point
in
time
the
florida
supreme
court
recognized
that
that
now
bound
it
in
its
determination,
and
found
that
we
did
not
have
to
give
a
reasonable
alternative.
it
was
a
good
faith
impoundment
based
upon
a
dui
arrest.
and
that
at
that
point
in
time
the
court
got
involved
in
the
inventory
question.
it
went
up
from
the
lower
appellate
court
to
the
higher
appellate
court
on
a
certified
question
within...
a
certified
conflict
rather,
within
florida,
on
two...
two
separate...
decisions
out
of
two
separate
circuits,
on
the
scope
of
the
consent
search,
based
upon
this
decision...
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
ross.
while
it
was
pending
because
the
florida
supreme
court
may,
in
exercising
its
discretionary
jurisdiction,
heard
the
case
on
the
conflict,
they
also
reached
the
other
matters
that
were
before
the
court,
and
that
was
the
impoundment
and
the
inventory.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
the
inventory
search
occurred
after
the
arrest,
after
the
car
was
towed--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--it
was...
the
search
occurred
in
1985,
prior
to
this
court's
opinion
in
bertine,
right
around
the
opperman
era.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
under
this...
under
this
court's
ruling?
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
under
the
procedure
as
the
officer
stated,
he
was
working
under
standard
operating
procedure
that
he
was
to
inventory
a
car
upon
impoundment
from
the
hood
to
the
trunk.
that
is
what
he
had
testified
to.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
the...
there
was
no
exact
testimony
on
that
point.
once
again,
the
reason
there
was
no
exact
testimony
on
that
point
is
because
that
was
not
at
issue
at
the
trial
court
level.
this
is
a
unique
area--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--no
finding
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
we
do
know--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--in
the
state's
view,
there
is
no
discretion,
because
an
inventory
search
within
operating
procedures
say
you
must
inventory
the
vehicle.
that
includes
closed
containers
anywhere
where
personal
valuable
property
might
be
located.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
that
is
the
testimony,
your
honor.
however,
the
inventory
was
done
in
good
faith.
the
article
that
he
looked
in
was
an
article
where
personal
property
was,
or
could
have
been,
located.
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
should
not
depend
upon
the
subjective
motivation
of
the
officer,
but
on
the
item
that
is
in
fact
searched.
whereas,
if
the
officer
opened
the
hood
of
the
car
and
looked
into
the
air
manifold,
then
that
would
be
unreasonable,
and
that
would
definitely
show
that
there
was
other
motives.
but
i
don't
think
we
need
to
look
at
the
other
motives
to
determine
the
reasonableness
of
the
search.
obviously
personal
property
would
not
have
been
found
in
that
scenario.
however,
in
a
scenario
where
they
had
opened
the
hood
to
check
to
make
sure
the
battery
was
there,
and
upon
closing
the
hood
a
piece
of
personal
property,
a
gun
or
something
else,
came
out
from
under
the
hood
upon
closing
it
down,
would
it
then
be
reasonable
to
look
further
into
the
hood
of
the
car
to
determine
if
there
was
other
personal
property
involved.
i
think
that
is
what
we
have
to
look
at
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
a
reasonable
search,
whether
the
motivation
involved
is
subjective
or
whether
it
is
a
reasonable
standard.
i
believe
that
the
cases
have
always
held
that
there
always
might
be
a
possibility
that
subjective
motivation
will
come
into
play,
that
there
will
be
a
dual
purpose
that
evidence
of
criminal
activity
might
be
uncovered
during
the
search.
but
the
question
really
is,
is
if
it
is
a
proper
inventory
search
to
begin
with,
does
the
ultimate
finding
of
contraband
invalidate
the
propriety,
the
original
propriety
of
the
inventory
search.
the
state,
obviously,
suggests
that
it
does
not,
as
long
as
the
state
meets
the
standards
that
are
required
by
this
court.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
i
would
suggest
that
he
would
be.
i
would
suggest
a
better
policy
would
be
to
open
that
suitcase,
even
if
it
means
breaking
that
suitcase,
to
list
the
property,
and
then
put
it
in
the
property
room.
it
would
be
far
much
of
a
less
of
a
burden
upon
the
state
in
terms
of
cost
and
energy
to
pay
for
a
$200
suitcase,
than
to
put
a
locked
suitcase
in
a
property
room,
and
when
it's
still
in
police
custody
something
happens
in
that
large
property
room
and
we
return
to
him
an
open
suitcase
with
contents
totally
missing.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
we
don't
know.
and
i,
the
state
is--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
the
state,
what
the
state
is
seeking
is
a
reversal
with
a
remand.
we
would
like
a
proper
rule
of
law
to
be
followed
so
that
this
can
then
be
remanded
back
to
the
trial
court
level
for
the
appropriate
findings
of
fact.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
i
think
under
the
inventory
doctrine,
the
only
purpose
in
the
inventory
doctrine
is
the
protection
of
the
property,
personal
valuable
property.
to
say
you
have
to
open
up
all
containers,
regardless
of
whether
they
would
in
fact
or
could
in
fact
contain
personal
property,
would
be
too
broad
in
scope
under
the
inventory
search
doctrine.
what
the
state
is
saying
is
that
it
is
to
be
those
containers
that
reasonably
could
contain
personal
property.
to
open
other
containers
would
become
just
a
general
exploratory
search,
because
they
would
not
fit
under
the
criteria
of
inventory
searches.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
yes,
they
did.
it
was
to
inventory
all
articles
and
property
in
the
vehicle.
and
that
is
in
the
joint
appendix
as
well
as
in
the
opinion
itself.
and
as
the
dissent
in
the
florida
supreme
court
said,
that
was
no
different
than
those
standards
that
were
upheld
by
this
court
in
bertine,
which
allowed
going
into
closed
containers,
because
in
that
case
the
standard
said
detailed
inventory.
true,
in
that
case
there
was
a
factual
finding
by
the
trial
court
saying
what
that
meant,
and
we
don't
have
one
here.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
the
accuracy
of
the
documentation
i,
we
do
not
question.
the
accuracy
of
the
interpretation,
obviously,
we
do
in
fact
question.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
that...
exactly.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
and
that
is
why
we
are
here--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--because
obviously
the
state
is
saying
that
that
is
not
what
this
court
has
meant
by
bertine
standard
procedures,
and
the
standard
procedures
that
was
meant
for
bertine
simply
was
that
an
inventory
must
occur
on
all
impounded
vehicles.
and
that...
and
that
inventory
would
go
to
all
articles
where
valuable
personal
property
might
be
located.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
i
think
in
terms
of
valuable
personal
property,
or
personal
property,
that
is
my
subjective
statement.
i
think
personal
property
to
the
individual
is
valuable.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
it
is
most
reasonable
to
assume
that,
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
the
discretion
is
there
subject
to
civil
liability.
but
he
doesn't
have
any
discretion
over...
on
the
policy
level.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
what
i
am
saying
is
that--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--no,
he
must
open
it
to
inventory
it.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
that
is
right.
we
are
saying
that
because--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
i
think
what
we...
what
the
problem
we
have
here
is
that
the
testimony
of
the
officer
was
never
fleshed
out.
that
is
why
what
the
state
is
seeking
is
a
rule
of
law
to
be
properly
applied
upon
a
remand,
so
that
the
florida
courts
could
then
determine
whether
or
not
that
policy
did
in
fact
exist.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
there
is
some
question
as
to
the
effective
date
of
that,
but
that
really
has
no
bearing
on
this
case,
because
in
the
testimony
of
trooper
adams
at
the
suppression
hearing,
there
was
no
mention
of
the
rules
and
regulations.
he
testified
that
it
was
standard
operating
procedures.
and,
in
fact,
the
form
that
was
used,
i
believe
in
1603,
was
in
fact
the
one
that
was
used
at
that
point
in
time.
the
rules
and
regulations
which
were,
came
into
effect
shortly
thereafter,
merely
codified
what
the
florida
highway
patrol
was
doing
to
all
procedures
during
that
period
of
time.
it
really
has
no
bearing.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
the
court,
again,
was
looking
at
the
written
and
not
the
oral,
and
the
oral
statement
by
the
officer
was--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
again,
you
know,
this
case
comes
before
this
court
in
a
strange
posture.
and
that
had
never
been
fleshed
out.
and
i
would
imagine
that,
based
upon
the
testimony,
which
said
this
was
the
standard
operating
procedure,
that
we
are
to
go
from
hood
to
trunk,
the
florida
supreme
court
might
well
have
gone
the
way
they
have
already.
that
is
why
we
are
really
asking
for
remand
for
factual
findings,
and
we're
asking
for
rule
of
law
to
define
what
standard
procedures
are
and
what
is
a
reasonable
scope
of
an
inventory.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
right.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
i
believe
that's
carrying--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--i
think
i
could
clarify
that,
that
any--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--closed,
non-clear
or
an
opaque
container,
where
you
can't
ascertain
the
contents
of
that.
and
that
is
what
we
are
really
talking
about.
we
have
to
be
able
to
ascertain
that--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--yes,
exactly.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
correct.
and
we
are
asking
for
a
very
broad
rule
under
the
inventory
search
doctrine,
because
how
else
are
you
going...
are
the
police
going
to
be
able
to
say
so--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
i
think...
but
i
think
that's
a
different
area,
because
they
can
ascertain
simply
by
looking
at
the
wine
bottle,
that
it
is
a
sealed
wine
bottle,
and
an
1850
label,
and
they
are
not
going
to
assume
the
liability
to
taste
that
wine.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
but
that
is
not
the
type
of
container
we
are
talking
about.
we
are
talking
about
a
container
that
contains
personal
property,
to
catalogue.
all
we
want
to
do
is
catalogue
the
contents
of
the
container.
you
catalogue
one
notebook.
now,
we
don't
care
what
is
in
that
notebook.
one
notebook.
one
can
of
shaving
cream.
we
don't
physically
remove
all
the
shaving
cream
to
say
this
is
in
fact
one
used
can
of
shaving
cream.
but
when
you
get
to
the
ounce
of
cocaine,
that
is
when
you
are
able
to
take
the
cocaine.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
no,
in
that--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--in
that
scenario,
what
i
was
talking
about
is
if
you
open
up
a
briefcase,
if
you
open
up
a
locked
briefcase,
and
those
are
the
three
items
you
find
in
that
locked
briefcase.
you
catalogue,
you
list,
you
don't...
there
is
no
need
for
the
police
to
open
up
that
notebook
and
read
what
is
in
that
notebook.
there
is
no
need
for
them
to
empty
that
shaving
cream.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
when
there
is
no
longer
a
fear
of
losing
personal
property.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
the
state
would
have
no
problem
with
listing
the
number
of
pages,
but
what
i
am
saying
is
you
don't
have
to
read--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--page
by
page.
that
is
how,
that
is
going
too
far.
that
is
not
safeguarding
the
property.
that
is
reading
the
property,
that
is
looking
for
something
in
the
property.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
because
what
occurs
if
you
put
that
briefcase
in
the
property
room
in
a
large
city,
and
when
six
hours,
eight
hours
later,
the
individual
comes
to
claim
it,
and
someone
had
seen
this
real
nice
briefcase
and
wanted
to
know
what
was
inside
of
it,
and
it
is
no
longer
one
locked
briefcase,
but
one
open,
empty
briefcase.
and
obviously
the
original
inventory
sheet
done
by
that
same
police
department,
given
to
the
property
room,
was
one
locked
briefcase.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
but
how
could
they
determine
if
there
were
diamond
rings
if
it
was
a
locked
suitcase?
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
that
is
right.
but
we
wouldn't
have
known
that
the
diamond
rings
were
there
had
we
not
had
the
ability
to
open
that
suitcase
to
begin
with.
and
at
that
point
in
time,
we
would
be
subject
to
liability,
because
it
was
still
in
our
custody,
because
we
put
down
three
diamond
rings.
he
gets
it
back
and
there
is
nothing.
but
it
was
all
done
in
our
custody,
so
yes,
we
would
be
liable.
but
at
least
at
that
point
in
time
we
know
what
we
would
be
liable
for.
if
we
didn't
do
that,
and
what--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--because
there
is
always
the
ability
to
file
a
lawsuit
in
that
scenario
that
when
it
came
back--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--that
is
right,
your
honor,
but
we
are
talking
about
the
costs
to
the
state
when
they
take
property
into
safekeeping.
and
in
terms
of
a
lawsuit,
whether
it
is
justifiable
or
not,
it
will
cost
the
state
a
lot
more
money
in
terms
of
manhours
and
legal
fees
to
defend
such
a
lawsuit
than
it
would
be
to
simply
open
a
locked
suitcase
and--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--nothing,
your
honor.
but
in
this
scenario
it
was
an
inventory
search.
and
he
might
well
should
have
done
that,
but
he
didn't,
and
we
are
here
simply
on
the
inventory
search
doctrine.
but
that's
a
specific
factual
question
on
this
case.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
well,
as
the
search
went
on
i
believe
he
had
probable
cause.
he
had--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--no,
no,
not
at
all.
what
happened
was,
after
the
impoundment
they
found
$3,000
worth
of
money.
they
searched
the
interior
of
the
car
under
proper
inventory
search.
they
found
the
marijuana
cigarettes,
then,
under
michigan
v.
thomas
or
united
states
v.
ross,
they
then
had
probable
cause
to
look
at
other
items
that
might
have
contained
the
contraband
that
they
found
in
the
ashtray.
in
fact--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
to
be
quite
frank,
the
officer,
as
he
got
further
and
further
along
in
his
search,
got
hungrier
and
hungrier.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
yeah.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
there
is
an
inventory.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
we
don't
know
what
it
says.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
the
state
does.
and--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
not
really.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
florida
supreme
court
applied
the
wrong
rule
of
law
in
this
case,
and
that
is
why
we
didn't
meet
the
burden.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
it
was
not
in
the
trial
court,
but
it
was
in
the
florida
supreme
court.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
policy
was.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
that
is
correct.
and
that
is
why
we
would
like
a
bright
line--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--we
would
like
to
begin
again,
to
determine
what
the
policy
is.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
we
still
could
have
opened
it.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
we
still
could
have
opened
it.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
we
do
have
the
inventory.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
the
officer
has
the
inventory.
it
was
never
at
issue
at
the
court
below,
so
it
was
never
introduced
into
evidence
by
the
prosecuting
attorney.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
there
was
no
need
to
put
it
into
evidence.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
we
want
to
establish
a
policy,
yes.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
no,
we
just
want
the
proper
principle
of
law.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
yes,
your
honor.
first
off,
my
opponent
has
conceded
that
the
florida
supreme
court's
holding
of...
interpretation
of
bertine,
is
wrong.
and
he
agrees
that
there
is
no
all
or
nothing
standard.
basically
then,
both
parties
agree
that
the
florida
supreme
court
applied
the
wrong
law
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
therefore
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
the
florida
supreme
court
for
a
determination
of
the
issue
under
the
proper
standard
of
the
law.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
no,
i
am
not
stipulating.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
i
am
not
stipulating,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
i
agree.
but,
i
think
both
parties
here
agree
there
is
some
sort
of
problem.
the
other
issue
that
i
would
like
to
bring
out
is
the
subjective--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--well,
that
is
not
necessarily
true,
because
in
the
joint
appendix
he
also
testified:
well,
based
on
the
regulations
we
go
by,
if
i
was
going
to
place
him
under
arrest
for
dui,
i
would
have
to
tow
the
car,
regardless,
and
from
there,
upon
towing
it,
we
would
have
to
do
an
inventory
search.
this
is
regardless
of
the
standard.
this
is
what--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--except
for
the
definition
of
what
an
inventory
search
is.
and
that
is
what
we
are
seeking
this
court
from.
the--
mr.
michael
j.
neimand
--the
issue
of
subjective
motivation,
subjective
intent,
was
never
raised
below.
the
florida
supreme
court
never
ruled
on
that
because
they
found
that
the
search,
the
scope
of
the
search
was
unwarranted.
i
don't
think
this
court
is
the
proper
avenue
to
decide
subjective
motivation.
i
think
that
is
the
question
that
best
be
left
for
another
day
when
the
issue
is
presented.
thank
you.
