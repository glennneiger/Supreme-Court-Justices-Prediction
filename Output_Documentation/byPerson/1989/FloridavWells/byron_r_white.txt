justice
byron
r.
white
but,
the
court
decided
that
the
instructions
were
so
and
so,
but
they
weren't
detailed
enough.
they
should
have
expressly
mentioned--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
that's...
they're
saying
that's
what,
that's
what
this
court's
opinions
require.
and
that
the,
that
the
instructions
were
deficient
because
they
didn't
really
expressly
deal
with
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
that
the
question
of
closed
containers
was
never
an
issue
in
the
trial
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
i
know,
but
so
you
want
to,
you
want
to...
you
have
never
had
a
chance
to
prove
what
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--policy
is.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
want
one,
you
want
the
first
time
chance.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
can't
stipulate
that
the
supreme
court
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
--florida
was
wrong.
you
can't--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but,
if
we
thought
it
was
right,
i
suppose
we
would
affirm
it.
