chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
88-1835,
florida
against
martin
leslie
wells.
mr.
neimand.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
neimand,
did
the
supreme
court
of
florida
in
its
opinion
spend
any
time
describing
what
the
rule
was
in
this
police
department
for
inventory
searches?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
question
the
accuracy
of
the
description
in
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
of
the
department's
inventory
search
policy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
thought
you
said
earlier,
too,
that
it
would
be
a
container
that
would
be
likely
to
be,
likely
to
be
expected
to
contain
personal
property?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
neimand.
mr.
johnson,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
johnson--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
supreme
court
of
florida,
as
i
read
its
opinion,
discusses
this
under
the
head
of
an
inventory
search,
and
they
don't
say
there
was
no
effort
to
make
an
inventory
search.
they
say
that
the
manual
did
not
provide
the
proper
instructions
for
making
an
inventory
search.
i...
i
don't
think
they
accepted
your,
the
theory
you
are
proposing
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
just
a
minute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
be
they
misguided
or
not,
do
you
agree
with
me
that
they
did
not
follow
the
theory
that
you
are
now
expounding,
when
they
came
to
discuss
the
inventory
search
in
their
opinion?
you
can
answer
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
agree
with
me?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
we
know
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
certainly
the
supreme
court
of
florida
indicated
otherwise.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--this
thing
isn't
in
the
record
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
supplement
the
record
that
way
in
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
you
know...
certainly
you
can't
contend
that
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
florida
should
be
affirmed
on
this
basis.
if
there
are
questions
like
this,
perhaps
that
is
all
the
more
reason
for
a
remand.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah.
well,
i--
--mr.
johnson,
do
you
think
that
there
is
only
one
permissible
rule
that
is
constitutional
for
an
inventory
search?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
meaning
no...
perhaps
no
discretion,
or
perhaps
some
discretion,
but
that
one
and
only
one
would
comply
with
the
constitution.
is
it
possible
that
a
no-discretion
rule
would
comply
with
it,
and
also
that
a
discretion
to
open
up
containers
that
might
contain
personal
property
rule
could
comply
with
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
johnson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
neimand,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
neimand.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
florida
versus
wells.
in
this
case,
after
the
respondent
was
arrested
for
driving
under
the
influence,
an
inventory
search
of
his
car
turned
up
a
locked
suitcase
in
the
trunk.
the
police
officials
opened
the
suitcase
and
discovered
a
garbage
bag
containing
a
large
quantity
of
marijuana.
the
florida
supreme
court
held
that
the
marijuana
should
have
been
suppressed
because
of
the
complete
absence
of
any
police
policy
concerning
the
way
they
dealt
with
closed
containers
that
they
found
during
an
inventory
search
like
this.
in
an
opinion
filed
today,
we
affirm
the
ruling
of
the
florida
supreme
court
that
the
marijuana
had
to
be
suppressed.
we
do
not
agree
with
the
florida
courtâ€™s
conclusion
however,
that
to
comport
with
the
fourth
amendment,
a
policy
of
procedure
governing
inventory
searches
must
require
that
either
all
containers
or
no
containers
be
opened.
while
such
policies
would
be
permissible,
it
would
be
equally
permissible
for
an
inventory
search
policy
to
allow
police
officials
to
open
any
containers
whose
contents
they
are
unable
to
figure
out
from
looking
at
the
exterior
of
the
container.
justice
brennan
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
of
the
court
in
which
justice
marshall
joins;
justices
blackmun
and
stevens
have
also
filed
opinions
concurring
in
the
judgment.
