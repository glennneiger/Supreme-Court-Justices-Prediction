i
know
this
much
already:
you're
in
big
trouble.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
you
don't
claim
the...
the
evulsion
is
just
the
creation
of
a
barrier
to
the
flow.
it's
the
dredging
and
depositing
it
on
the
shore,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
would
just
building
a
jetty
out
into
the
flow
constitute
evulsion?
wouldn't
that
jetty
simply
create
not
evulsion
but
accretion
further
downstream?
if
accretion
should
happen
because
of
the
jetty,
that
wouldn't
be
called
evulsion,
would
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
that
water
has
been
diverted
by
a
jetty
or
some
action
by
the
corps
of
engineers.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
barmeyer,
is
it...
is
it
true
that
he
would
have,
would
not
have
done
this
if
oyster
island
didn't
exist?
i
am
under
the
impression
he
would
have
done
it
anyway.
i
thought
that
he
was
regarding
the
shoal
that
is
north
of
oyster
bed
island
as
the
substitute
for
a
headland
in
defining
the
mouth
of
the
river,
and
that
the
reason
he
went
into
the
navigation
channel
at
that
point
is
simply
effectively
he
was
saying
that
is
where
the
river
ends.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
would
have
done
that
whether
the
island
was
there
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
calibogue
sound?
is
that
a
sound
up
there,
calibogue
sound?
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
also
in
the
mouth
of
the
river?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
whatever,
it's
an
awfully
big
mouth
of
the
river
if
it
embraces
the...
the
entrance
to
a
sound
and
the
entrance
to
two
other
rivers,
whether
they're
tidal
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mccutchen,
suppose
i
owned
a
piece
of
private
land
out
in
the
country
somewhere,
and
i
had
never
even
camped
out
on
it
in
50
years,
and
you...
you
had
gone
under
dark
of
night
and
camped
there
a
couple
of
nights,
but
i
never
knew
about
it.
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument,
that,
you
know,
scalia
has
never
been
on
that
land
for
50
years,
and
i
have
been
there
frequently.
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
there
have
to
be
a
notoriety?
isn't
the
whole
point
that
i
have
to
have
knowledge
that
you
are
on
my
land
and
you
are
asserting
juris...
you
are
asserting
ownership
of
my
land?
justice
antonin
scalia
under
the
act,
is
there
anyway
south
carolina
could
have
prevented
the
corps
of
engineer
from
dumping
the
sediment
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i...
i
just
don't
know
how
that
works.
the
corps
of
engineer
can
just
dump
the
stuff
anywhere
it
wants
up
and
down
the
river?
just
say
here's
a
good
spot,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--suppose
a
line...
suppose
an
island
pops
up
right
in
the
middle
of
the...
what
is
the
latin
phrase,
the
filum?
you
had
a
lot
of
good
latin
in
the
briefs
there,
what
was
it?
it
is
right
in
the
middle--
justice
antonin
scalia
--where
the
boundary
line
is
placed
in
the
northernmost
stream,
up
comes
an
island
right
in
the
middle,
and
the
boundary
goes
right
in
the
middle
of
the
island.
what
would
be
the
situation
there?
south
carolina
would
own
half
and
georgia
would
own
half?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
but...
do
you
know
any
other
interstate
boundary
that
works
like
that,
where
an
island
in
the
middle
of
the
river
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
am
not
asserting
it
was
in
the
middle
of
the
stream.
i
am
just
asserting
that
the
principle
you
are
arguing
for
has
some
rather
embarrassing
and
silly
consequences.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mccutchen,
looking
at
appendix
b
on,
in
georgia's
brief,
i...
how
did
the...
and
you
support
the
master's...
the
master's
decision
to
jog
the
line
south
just
before
oyster
bed
island.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
the
basis
for
that
angle
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see
where
the
yellow
line
goes
south
and
where
georgia
would
prefer
the
red
line...
yes
the
red
line.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
thought
that
was
dry
land
up
there,
that
that
line
represented
the
mid
point
between
dry
land
on
both
sides
in
1787?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
recall,
it
didn't
have
to
do
with
dry
land.
it
had
to
do
with
his
thinking
that
the,
that
the
navigation
channel
was
south
of
there,
and
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
was
so
close
to
the
mouth
at
this
point
that
we
will
just
follow
the
navigation
channel.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
far
above
where
the
south
boundary
is?
i
mean,
that
is
the
only
question
we
are
talking
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
this
appendix
b,
can
you...
i...
i'm
not
clear
on
that.
on
georgia's
appendix
b,
where,
where
north
of
tybee
is
the...
is
the
northern
point
of
the
line
that
constitutes
the
mouth?
is
it
at
those
dotted
lines?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
the
clerk
in
fairfax
county
here
would
accept
a
deed
to
maryland
land
for
filing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
so,
but
maybe...
maybe
the
clerks
aren't
as
quick
there,
but--
