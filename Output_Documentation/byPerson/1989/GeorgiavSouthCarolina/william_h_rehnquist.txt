may
proceed.
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
what
color
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
are
all
beige.
okay,
appendix
b
where?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
it's
in
the
back?
and
it's
b
as
in
boy?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
it
is
a
sudden
change
rather
than
a
gradual
one
that
comes
from
accretion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
he
give
any
explanation
at
all
for
his
change?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
considerably
upstream,
wasn't
it?
the
1922
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
barmeyer,
do
you
say
that
prescription
can't
occur
if
the
united
states
has
published
a
map
showing
something
is
in
georgia
rather
than
in
south
carolina?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
your
strongest
case,
the
strongest
case
for
your
position
on
prescription,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
barmeyer.
mr.
mccutchen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you...
do
you
say
it
is
enough
to
bring
home
the
claim
of
the
occupation
to
georgia
citizens,
or
does
it
have
to
be
brought
home
in
some
way
to
the
government
of
georgia?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
a
bridge
over
the
river
at
this
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
a
bridge
over
the
river
at
this
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mccutchen,
certainly
if
prescription
had
not
occurred
by
the
time
that
that
suit
was
brought,
that
would
have
been
an
act
of
georgia
at
any
rate
that
would
have
refuted
its
acquiescence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
port
of
savannah?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
the
port
of
georgia.
you
mean
the
port
of
savannah?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
the
basically
north
sound...
south
line
that
connects
tybee
island
to
hilton
head
island?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
east-west--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
mccutchen.
ms.
barmeyer,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
barmeyer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
