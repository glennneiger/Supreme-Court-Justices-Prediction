ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
original
action
was
initiated
by
georgia
in
1977
in
order
to
resolve
disputes
concerning
the
boundary
between
georgia
and
south
carolina
in
the
lower
savannah
river,
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
the
lateral
seaward
boundary.
both
georgia
and
south
carolina
have
filed
exceptions
to
the
reports
of
the
special
master.
in
order
to
outline
the
exceptions,
i'd
like
to
ask
the
court
to
turn
to
appendix
b
to
georgia's
brief
and
exceptions.
appendix
b
is
a
map
of
the
relevant
area.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
they
are
all
beige.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
appendix
b
to
georgia's
exceptions
and
brief
[inaudible].
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
this
is
a
modern-day
map
which
is
shown
in
gray,
and
superimposed
on
the
modern-day,
1983
map,
is--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--appendix
b.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
exceptions
and
brief
of
the
state
of
georgia.
ms.
patricia
t.

and
it
folds

ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
barmeyer.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
it.
all
right.
this
map
is
a
modern-day
map
which
is
shown
in
the
lighter
color
gray.
superimposed
on
the
gray,
in
black,
is
an
outline
of
the
1955
shoreline.
the
special
master
found
that
the
1955
map
was
the
earliest
authoritative
map
of
the
area,
and
it
was
on
the
1855
map
that
he
drew
the
recommended
boundary
line.
on
this
map
the
savannah
river
flows
from
upstream,
which
is
at
the
left,
to
the
atlantic
ocean,
which
is
on
the
right.
the
state
of
south
carolina
is
at
the
top
of
the
map.
the
state
of
georgia
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
map.
the
city
of
savannah
is
on
the
left.
the
special
master's
recommended
boundary
line
is
shown
in
yellow,
and
georgia's
exceptions
are
shown
in
red.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
i'm
trying
to
be
sure
we're
all
together
at
the
outset.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
before
i
go
to
the
specific
areas
in
dispute,
i'd
like
to
remind
the
court
of
the
controlling
document
here,
which
is
the
treaty
of
beaufort
in
1787,
which
was
entered
into
by
georgia
and
south
carolina.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
yes,
sir.
it
is
appendix
a,
actually
articles
1
and
articles
2
are
appendix
a
to
georgia's
brief
and
exceptions.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
it
is
in
evidence,
your
honor,
and
those
exhibits
have
been
sent
to
the
court.
by
the
treaty,
the
boundary
between
georgia
and
south
carolina
is
the
most
northern
branch
or
stream
of
the
river,
expressly
reserving
all
islands
in
the
river
to
georgia.
this
court
had
occasion
to
consider
the
treaty
of
beaufort
in
the
case
of
georgia
v.
south
carolina
in
1922,
and
the
court
further
explicated
that
boundary
and
determined
that
the
boundary
is
the
geographic
middle
of
the
boundary
stream,
irrespective
of
the
navigation
channel
or
thalweg
of
the
river.
the
court
reaffirmed
that
all
islands
in
the
savannah
river
are
in
georgia.
the
court
also
stated
in
1922
that
the
boundary
stream
may
be
narrow
and
shallow
and
insignificant,
as
compared
to
the
main
body
of
the
river,
but
that
doesn't
matter
if
it
is
the
northernmost
branch
or
stream
of
the
river.
now,
first
i
would
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
barnwell
island
area.
it
is
about
two
miles
downstream
from
the
city
of
savannah,
and
on
this
map
it
is
directly
north
of
the
inset
map,
which
is
simply
a
slightly
larger
view
of
the
barnwell
island
area.
the
barnwell
islands
were
islands
of
marsh
in
the
savannah
river
and
were
in
georgia
by
the
terms
of
the
treaty
of
beaufort
in
1787.
by
the
evulsive
actions
of
the
corps
of
engineers,
they
became
attached
to
the
south
carolina
shore.
with
the
continued
improvement
and
dredging
for
navigation
purposes,
improvement
of
the
river
and
the
deposit
of
dredged
material
on
these
marshy
islands,
they
have--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--well,
your
honor,
they
have
evulsed
up
and
down
the
savannah
river.
they
have
blocked
the
boundary
stream
by
the
creation
of
dams
which
blocked
off
the
northernmost
branch
or
stream
of
the
river,
and
that--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--that
is
right,
your
honor.
and
the
special
master
agreed
with
that.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
that
is
right,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
that
is
right,
your
honor.
the
distinction,
we
believe,
between
evulsion,
which
we
had
in
this
case,
and
accretion
is
accretion
is
the
deposit
of
material
by
the
gradual
action...
by
the
water
dropping
sediment.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
that
is
correct.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
that
is
correct.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
roughly
in
the
middle.
it
is
a
triangular
island.
both
upstream
and
downstream
there
are
these
two
areas
of
made
land.
south...
the
special
master
concluded
that
the
change
in
the
bound...
in
the
savannah
river,
was
by
evulsive
actions
by
the
corps
of
engineers,
and
as
a
result
the
boundary
did
not
move.
south
carolina
has
excepted
to
that
recommendation.
the
next
area
i
would
like
to
direct
your
attention
to
is
oyster
bed
island,
which
is
at
the
point
where
the
yellow
line
and
the
red
line
diverge.
oyster
bed
island
was
not
in
existence
in
1787.
it
emerged
gradually
and
naturally
from
the
bed
of
the
savannah
river
in
the
late
19th
century.
it
is
now
attached
to
south
carolina
by
more
dumping
of
dredged
material
by
the
corps
of
engineers.
the
special...
georgia
contends
that
it
is
in
georgia,
either
because
all
islands
are
in
georgia,
even
if
they
formed
after
the
treaty
of
beaufort,
so
long
as
they
formed
naturally,
or,
in
the
alternative,
that
oyster
bed
island
must
be
in
georgia
because
it
is
south
of
the
geographic
middle
between
the
islands
that
were
in
existence
in
1787,
which
is
cockspur
island,
georgia,
just
to
the
south,
and
turtle
island,
georgia...
turtle
island,
south
carolina.
the
special
master
was
following
a
geographic
middle
in
this...
his
yellow
line,
until
he
got
to
the
point
at
the
southern
tip
of
turtle
island,
when
he,
rather
inexplicably
we
contend,
jumped
from
a
geographic
middle
boundary
to
delineation
of
a
boundary
in
the
navigation
stream...
navigation
channel
of
the
river.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
his
conclusion
was
that
the
decision
in
1922
that
the
thalweg
did
not
apply,
he
concluded
that
that
did
not
control
in
the
mouth
of
the
river
area.
and
he
concluded
that
the
framers
must
have
had
the
navigation
channel
in
mind
when
they
drew
the
treaty.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
that
is
right.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
between
oyster
bed
island
and
cockspur
island?
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
roughly,
he
did,
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
well,
his,
his
conclusion
was
that
the
geography
in
1855
was
what
was
controlling.
and
using
that
theory
and
using
his
theory
that
he
was
going
to
follow
the
1922
decision
so
long
as
there
were
islands
in
the
river,
i
think
he
necessarily
should
have
continued
that
geographic
middle,
at
least
until
he
passed
cockspur
island,
georgia,
which
everybody
concedes
is
an
island
in
the
savannah
river
and
in
georgia.
if
he
had
only
continued
that
a
little
bit
further
to
the
eastern
end
of
cockspur
island
then,
although
we
would
have
disagreed
with
it,
he
could
then
have
made
a
dog
leg
to
the
navigation
channel
of
the
river,
and
oyster
bed
island
would
have
been
in
georgia
rather
than
in
south
carolina.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
that's
further
east,
your
honor--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--in
that
area,
that's
the
mouth
of
the
river.
but
that's
further
east.
if
i
could
get
you
to
follow
his
line
a
little
further
east,
you
see
tybee
island,
georgia.
he
found
that
the
mouth
of
the
river
was
just
north
of
tybee
island,
and
he
referred
to
a
large
prominent
shoal
opposite
tybee
island,
and
did,
i
believe,
more
or
less
substitute
that
shoal
for
headland.
but
that
decision
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
oyster
bed
island
area.
georgia
contends
that
he
should
have
stayed
in
the
geographic
middle
throughout
the
boundary
waters,
that
he
should
have
determined
the
line
based
on
the
nearest
point
in
georgia
and
the
nearest
point
in
south
carolina
until
he
reached
the
seaward
limit
of
the
internal
waters
of
georgia.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
i
would
direct
your
attention,
justice
stevens,
to
this
oblique
line
that
goes
from
hilton
head
island--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--that
is
right.
that
is
certainly
the
closest
point
in...
south
carolina
and
the
closest
point
in
georgia.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
the
parties
are
in
agreement
on
that.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
yes,
sir.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
all
the
record
and
evidence
of
the
18th
century
perception
was
that
the
framers
understood
the
mouth
to
be
at
tybee
rather
than
in
this
oyster
bed
island
area.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
that
is
right.
even
if
the
entire
area
is
not
technically
the
mouth,
it
is
our
position
that
the
1922
case
said
you
don't
look
at
the
thalweg,
you
don't
look
at
the
navigation
channel,
you
find
the
geographic
middle
between
the
island
shore
in
georgia
and
the
closest
point
in
south
carolina,
and
that
you
can
draw
a
very
simple...
simply
plotted
geographical
mathematical
line
by
using
those
closest
points.
and
in
this
case
it
would
be
turtle
island,
south
carolina,
daufuskie
island,
south
carolina
and
hilton
head
island.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
it
has
a
very--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--everything
inside
of
that,
this
oblique
line,
is
the
closing
line
drawn
by
the
united
states.
on
the
left
we
have
internal
waters,
and
to
the
right
we
have
the
territorial
sea.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
yes,
yes,
your
honor,
there
are
two
key
references
here.
one
is
by
general
oglethorpe,
who
was
the
founder
of
the
colony
of
georgia,
who
referred
to
hilton
head
as
being
at
the
mouth
of
the
savannah
river.
and
a
subsequent
key
reference
is
from
the
united
states
coast
survey
which,
in
describing
the
mouth
of
the
savannah
river,
referred
to
hilton
head
island.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
well,
your
honor,
they
are
tidal
rivers.
we
call
them
rivers,
but
they
really
are
arms
of
the
sea.
this
is
a...
is
an
estuary
where
the
fresh
waters
meet
the
ocean,
and
this
is
an
entire
area
of
mixing.
but
given
the
fact
that
everybody
agreed
that
tybee
island
was
the
mouth
of
the
river
on
the
south,
both
tybee
island
and
hilton
head
island
are
really
barrier
islands
that
form
the
boundary
between
the
ocean
and
the
estuary.
and
hilton
head
island
is
as
much
an
island
at
the
mouth
of
the
savannah
river
as
tybee
island
is,
we
submit.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
it
is--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--it's
an
arm
of
the
sea.
it
is
a
place
where
these
waters
enter
and
flow
out,
and
it
flows
around
tybee
island.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
well,
it
is.
its
shape
is...
gives
a
little
pause
because
it
is
elongated.
in
the
territorial
sea,
the
special
master,
just
to
go
through
the
exceptions,
the
special
master
has...
recommended
a
boundary
which
is
basically
an
equidistant
line
with
some
minor
modifications.
south
carolina
has
excepted
to
the
master's
line
in
the
territorial
sea,
contending
that
it
cuts
off
south
carolina's
coastal
front.
georgia
believes
that
the
recommended
boundary
in
the
territorial
sea
is
imminently
correct,
if
the
special
master
has
used
the
correct
starting
point.
if
the
starting
point
is
incorrect,
then
georgia
would
submit
that
the
line
should
be
redrawn
using
the
same
principles
of
law.
i
would
like
to
focus
first
on
the
barnwell
island
area,
which
all
parties
agree
is
the
most
important
and
valuable
area
in
dispute.
and
there
the
question
is
prescription
and
acquiescence.
this
court,
in
many
cases,
has
invoked
the
doctrine
of
prescription
and
acquiescence
as
an
aid
in
determining
the
correct
location
of
a
boundary
which
is
otherwise
uncertain.
in
such
cases
the
court
has
looked
for
proof
of
continuous
undisturbed
exercise
of
sovereignty
for
a
period
which
is
long
enough
to
lead
to
a
general,
indeed
a
virtually
universal
conviction
as
to
the
boundary
location.
it's
georgia's
position
that
south
carolina's
claim
of
prescription
and
acquiescence
is
refuted
by
the
actions
of
south
carolina,
the
actions
of
the
united
states
and
the
actions
by
the
state
of
georgia.
turning
first
to
the
actions
by
south
carolina,
we
have
south
carolina's
solemn
agreement
by
the
treaty
of
beaufort
that
all
islands
are
in
georgia.
and
south
carolina
continued
to
reaffirm
that
absolute,
unequivocal
language
of
the
treaty
of
beaufort:
all
islands
are
in
georgia.
there
were
discussions
between
the
two
states
in
the
19th
century
about
where
exactly
the
line
was.
was
it
on
the
south
carolina
bank,
was
it
on
the
island
bank?
discussions
about
fishing
rights,
navigation
rights,
taxation
of
structures
and
so
forth.
and
in
all
those
discussions,
correspondence
between
the
governors
and
the
attorneys
general,
cases
in
this
court,
there
was
never
so
much
as
a
whisper
from
south
carolina
that
there
is
any
exception
to
the
blanket
reservation
of
all
islands
in
the
savannah
river
to
the
state
of
georgia.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
well,
but
that,
that
was...
south
carolina--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--that
is
right.
but
every
time
georgia
and
south
carolina
met
to
debate
the
boundary,
south
carolina
says
to
georgia
all
islands
are
in
georgia.
you
don't
need
to
worry
about
it.
at
the
same
time,
they
are
now
saying
well,
but
we
were
prescribing
on
this
tract
of
land,
barnwell
island,
but
we
never
really
told
you
about
it
and
we
never
had
a
formulation
of
the
treaty
that
would
encompass
those
islands.
in
most
of
the
cases
by
the
court
we
are
dealing
with
some
construction
of
a
boundary
document
which
is
a
rational
basis,
a
reasonable
basis
for
the
exercise
of
prescription
or
the
exercise
of
possession
and
jurisdiction.
here
we
think
south
carolina's
continued
statements
refutes
the
claim
of
prescription
and
acquiescence.
indeed
its
statements,
its
pleadings
to
this
court
in
1922,
and
the
1922
case
was
dealing
with
an
island
which
was
only
35
or
40
feet
from
the
south
carolina
shore,
and
south
carolina
never
took
the
position
in
that
case
that
islands
close
to
the
south
carolina
shore
are
in
south
carolina.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
yes,
your
honor,
it
was.
it
was
not
in
this
particular
area.
one
key
fact
is
that
barnwell
island
continued
to
be
islands,
and
perceptible
as
islands
in
the
river,
until
well
in
the
20th
century,
as
shown
by
appendix
d
to
our
brief,
which
is
an
aerial
photograph
in
1931.
the
actions
by
the
united
states
we
believe
are
critical,
because
the
united
states
continuously
understood
and
published
maps
showing
barnwell
island
in
georgia.
for
these
maps
i
would
note
that
we
have
a
chronology,
which
is
appendix
j
to
our
rebuttal
brief,
where
some
of
these
key
facts
and
key
publications
are
set
forth.
but
i
will
outline
some
of
them
briefly.
in
1866
the
united
states
performed
a
survey
on
barnwell
island,
and
labeled
that
survey
as
barnwell
island,
georgia.
there
are
no
maps
in
the
19th
century
with
boundary
line--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--no,
your
honor,
not
just
one
map.
but
what
the
cases
look
for
is
a
general
conviction.
prescription
and
acquiescence
is
used
to
ratify
what
is
already
well
understood.
and
in
this
case
we
think
the
continued
publication
of
maps
showing
barnwell...
by
the
united
states
and
indeed
by
georgia,
showing
barnwell
island
in
georgia,
is
sufficient
to
refute
south
carolina's
contention
that
there
was
a
general
conviction
that
barnwell
island
was
in
south
carolina.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
there
is
really
no
case
just
like
this,
your
honor.
there
is
no
case
where
a
state
is
being
divested
of
an
area
of
land
that
is
currently
in
its
possession,
as
barnwell
island
is
currently
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
georgia.
the
closest
case
is
arkansas
v.
tennessee.
it
is
really
the
only
case
we
found
where
there
is
an
island...
this
is
arkansas
v.
tennessee
in
1940,
where
there
was
an
island
in
the
river
which
was
clearly
in
arkansas
by
the
boundary
document,
but
prior
to
the
admission
of
arkansas
into
the
union,
it
became
affixed
to
the
tennessee
shore.
and
from
then
on
there
was
a
universal
treatment
of
that
land
as
being
in
tennessee.
generations
of
people
grew
up
on
that
island;
they
were
educated
in
schools
on
the
island,
operated
by
tennessee.
they
voted
in
tennessee
elections;
they
were
married
by
justices
of
the
peace
in
tennessee.
so
there
really
was
a
course
of
conduct,
universal
treatment
of
the
land
as
being
in
tennessee,
without
any
objection
by
the
state
of
arkansas.
of
course
in
this
case,
georgia
did
not
acquiesce.
georgia
went
into
court
in
1953,
the
first
time
that
georgia
was
aware
that
anybody
was
claiming
that
the
land
was
in
south
carolina.
georgia
went
into
court
and
intervened,
claiming
georgia
dominion,
sovereignty
and
title
over
barnwell
island.
the
case
was
thrown
out
by
the
district
judge
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
the
case
was
appealed
by
the
united
states
and
by
georgia
to
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
there
is,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
barnwell
island
is
in
georgia.
we
certainly
think
that
goes
also
to
refute
a
general
conviction
that
barnwell
island
is
in
south
carolina.
back
to
the
maps
of
the
united
states,
in
1911,
1920,
1932,
1957,
1959,
1970,
1971,
1974,
these
are
official
published
maps,
circulated
maps
by
the
agencies
of
the
united
states,
without
ever
any
protest
by
the
state
of
south
carolina
that
the
map...
they
contended
the
boundary
was
incorrect.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
those
deeds
and
those
transactions--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--if
that...
if
anybody
had
wanted
to
buy
it.
in
fact,
what
we
have
is
transactions--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--yes,
sir,
it
has
more
value
now
than
it
did
then.
but
the
transactions
which
are
of
record
are
only
among
members
of
one
family,
and
in
fact
there
are
really
only
a
handful
of
deeds--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--that
family
clearly
thought
the
islands
were
in
south
carolina.
they
never
resided
on
the
islands.
they
farmed
them
for
a
brief
period
in
the
19th
century
as
part
of
a
rice
plantation
that
they
had
on
the
mainland.
so
there
were
never
any
residents
on
the
island.
but
it
is
clear
that
family...
but
we
contend
it
was
very
limited
to
that
family
in
terms
of
a
perception
that
the
islands
were
in
south
carolina.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
well,
that's
right.
they
couldn't
find
a
buyer
for
the
land.
they
finally
abandoned
it
and
then
it
was
seized
for
non-payment
of
taxes
by
the
sheriff.
there
really
wasn't
much
that
ever
happened
on
these
islands,
and
we
think
again
that
distinguishes
this
case
from
arkansas
v.
tennessee
in
1940
and
the
other
cases
where
the
court
has
used
prescription
and
acquiescence
to
change
the
jurisdictional
location
of
a
tract
of
land.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
well,
if
you
rule
in
our
favor
i
think
it
is
clear
that
it
is
owned
by
the
state
of
georgia,
if
it's...
although
those
questions
would
be
decided
by
the
courts
in
the
respective
states,
whichever
state
is
to
prevail.
the
south
carolina
claim
fails,
we
contend,
on
both
points,
both
on
prescription,
because
the
acts
that
were
shown
to
have
been
performed
regarding
barnwell
island
are
so
sparse
and
generally
not
of
record,
generally
not
of
widespread
notice
or
notoriety,
and
because
there
hasn't
been
acquiescence
by
the
state
of
georgia
as
indicated
both
by
georgia
maps
and
by
the
maps
by
the
united
states.
i
would
like
to
save
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
thank
you,
your
honor.
georgia
agrees
with
the
point
made
by
the
chief
justice
that
south
carolina
must
show
prescription
and
acquiescence
as
of
1953,
because,
of
course,
otherwise
it
would
be
defeated
by
the
action
taken
by
georgia
in
intervening
and
pursuing
the
case,
the
condemnation
case
that
went
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
question
is,
as
of
1953,
was
there
the
cumulative
notoriety
that's
required
in
the
cases
to
change
the
location
of
barnwell
island
from
georgia
to
south
carolina?
was
there
any
notice
to
georgia?
now,
georgia
asserted
to
the
fifth
circuit
that
georgia
did
not
know
that
the
boundary
was
in
dispute,
because
south
carolina
had
never
made
any
claim
to
barnwell
island
that
was
brought
home
to
the
state
of
georgia
until
in
1955,
when
south
carolina
sought
to
file
an
original
action
in
the
court.
that
was
the
first
time
that
south
carolina
appeared
on
the
scene
and
said
yes,
we
claim
barnwell
island.
as
of
1955--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--deeds
were
recorded
and
taxes
were
paid
in
south
carolina,
but
those
are
primarily
passive
acts
by
the
clerk
of
court.
if
you
go
to
the
clerk
of
court
and
you
record
a
deed
in
its
improper
form,
it
is
going
to
be
recorded.
if
you
say
i
own
1,000
acres
in
beaufort
county,
and
here
are
my
taxes,
they
are
going
to
accept
it.
there
wasn't
any
affirmative
exercise
of
south
carolina--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--if
it
was
in--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--if
it
said
it
was
in
virginia.
if
the
deed
on
its
face
said
it
was
in
virginia,
i
submit
they
would
record
it.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
in
south
carolina
they
recorded
it.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
taxes
were
paid
in
georgia
in
the
early
19th
century:
1825,
1830
and
1831.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
in
1831
taxes
were
received
and
accepted.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
well,
i
think
all
of
these
facts
have
significance,
but
what
the
court
does
is
take
all
of
them
and
determine
is
there
enough
to
say
that
there
was
a
general--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--taxes
are
key,
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
way
these
lands
were
reported
for
taxes
in
south
carolina
was
i
am
charlotte
barnwell,
i
tell
the
tax
collector
i
own
152
acres,
and
i
pay
the
tax
on
it.
there
is
nothing
on
the
tax
records--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--there
may
well
be,
your
honor.
at
least
until
the
20th
century
and
the
'60s,
when
the
clerks
were
able
to
get
these
photogrammetric
tax
maps
where
you
could
really
superimpose
the
property
boundaries
on
the
land,
in
georgia
and
other
states
that
were
not
granted,
and
south
carolina,
that
were
granted
randomly
with
irregular
parcels,
there
wasn't
a
chart
that
somebody
could
go
to
to
see
whether
or
not
this
township,
this
range,
whether
or
not
the
land
had
been
granted,
whether
or
not
taxes
had
been
paid.
i
think
it's
key
that
south
carolina
did
not
even
know
of
the
grant
by
south
carolina
to
this
land.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
your
cases
have
said
that
the
master's
findings
are
entitled
to
a
tacit
presumption
of
correctness.
but
the
role
of
the
court
is
to
make
a
de
novo
review,
an
independent
review
of
the
record,
and
to
assure
itself
that
a
correct
decision
has
been
made.
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
yes,
sir,
that
is
correct.
on
the--
ms.
patricia
t.
barmeyer
--thank
you,
your
honor.
