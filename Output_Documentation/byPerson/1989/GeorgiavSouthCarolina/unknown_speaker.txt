that's
the
1855
shoreline
on
chart?
unknown
speaker
appendix
which?
unknown
speaker
is
this
exception
to
the
brief
of
south
carolina?
unknown
speaker
or
in
baker
or
one
of
those
things?
unknown
speaker
is
this
it?
unknown
speaker
i
think
we're
with
you.
it
may
take
more
than
that.
unknown
speaker
it
would
still
be
accretion.
unknown
speaker
in
this
case
what
we
had
was
the
corps
of
engineers
dredging
material
from
the
river
bottom
and
placing
it
blocking
the...
this
boundary
stream.
with
barnwell
island,
the
issue
is
prescription
and
acquiescence.
south
carolina
contends
that
actions
which
are
primarily
transactions
by
and
among
members
of
one
family
and
isolated
and
intermittent
actions
by
local
county
officials
have
operated
to
change
the
boundary
between
georgia
and
south
carolina
and
to
put
barnwell
island
in
south
carolina,
in
the
face
of
south
carolina's
continued
reiteration
of
the
treaty
provisions
that
all
islands
are
in
georgia,
and
in
spite
of
actions
by
the
united
states
and
actions
by
the
state
of
georgia
on
maps
and
other
official
actions
showing
barnwell
island
in
georgia.
moving
downstream
to
the
next
areas
in
dispute,
there
are
two
areas
of
made
land
on
the
north
shore
of
the
savannah
river
which
south
carolina
has
excepted...
where
south
carolina
has
excepted
to
the
master's
recommended
line.
they
are
not
labeled
here,
since
this
went
with
georgia's
exceptions,
but
there
are
two
places.
one
just
to
the
left
or
upstream
of
jones
island,
where
the
boundary
line
crosses
on
to
the
northern
bank,
and
then
another
area
downstream
of
jones
island,
which
is
called
horseshoe
shoal,
although,
again,
it
is
not
labeled
here.
where
on
the
map,
from
left
to
right,
where
is
jones
island?
is
it...
oh,
i
see
it.
it
is
roughly
in
the
middle
from
left
to
right,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
everything
inside
of
that
is
inland
waters?
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
where
is
the
port
of
georgia?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
started
his
line
just
at
the...
just
at
sort
of
just
a
little
north
of
where
you
say
the
mouth
was.
you
started
his...
the
master
started
his
perpendicular
seaward
boundary
just
a
little
north
of
where
you
say
the
mouth
was?
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
that
is
right,
where
he
started
it?
it's
just
that...
he
just...
it's
just
that
he
went
off
in
the
wrong
direction.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
georgia's...
georgia's
exhibit
b
is...
appendix
b
just
isn't
right.
well,
anyway--
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
so
at
all.
