is
the
whole...
is
the
entire
treaty
anywhere
in
your
briefs?
justice

but
that's
not
the
entire
treaty.

everybody
ignores
the
new
river
and
the
wright
river?
do
they
have
a
mouth,
or
do
they
just
go
into
the
savannah?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
was
seized
by
the
south
carolina
sheriff?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
rule
in
your
favor,
is
it
still
owned
by
south
carolina?

kennedy
what
about
the
fifth
circuit
case
in
1955?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
georgia's
actions
in
that
case
be
a
prescriptive
act
of
its
own?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
south
carolina
had
been
on
the
scene
all
along,
because
that's
been
where
the
deeds
were
recorded
and
the
taxes
were
paid,
and
this
land
was
being
obviously
used.
