justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
is
that
limit,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
you
think
the
mouth
of
the
river
is
hilton
head
at
the
north
and
tybee
island
at
the
south.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
the
parties
agree
that
the
tybee
island
is...
is
the
point
from
which
you
measure
the
southern
boundary
of
the
mouth
of
the
river?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
are
in
agreement
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
either
have
to
draw
a
rather
horizontal
line
or
else
go
up
to
hilton
head.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
position
is
the
mouth
is
the
entire
area
between
hilton
head
and
tybee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
river
has
a
very
big
mouth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
is
just
a
condition
that
was
prior
to
the
prescription,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
you
start
with
that
these
islands
did
belong
to
georgia
originally,
but
then
by
prescription
they
became
the
property
or
sovereign
property
of
south
carolina.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
refresh
my
recollection?
the
facts
in
this
are
awfully
hard
to
keep
in
mind.
am
i
correct
in
recalling
that
as
far
as
the
records
of
title
ownership
and
the
like,
that
they
were
all
kept
in
south
carolina,
and
that
georgia
had
no
deeds
recorded
in
georgia,
and
the
taxes
were
paid
in
south
carolina?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
a
lawyer
wanted
to
go
buy
the
property
and
register
it,
he
probably
would
have
gone
into
the
south
carolina
jurisdiction
rather
than
georgia.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
apparently
somebody
does
now.
i
guess
somebody
wants
to
buy
it
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
thought
they
lived
in
south
carolina.
they
thought
they
lived
in
south
carolina.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
were
apparently
the
only
people
who
were
interested.
