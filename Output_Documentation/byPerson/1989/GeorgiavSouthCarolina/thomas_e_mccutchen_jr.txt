mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
while
several
questions
are
here
before
the
court,
the
major
issue,
the
major
financial
issue
is
the
barnwell
island
islands.
and
south
carolina
seeks
the
approval
of
the
master
on
that
issue.
by
interrogatory
number
3,
georgia
admitted
that
it
asserted
no
jurisdiction
or
sovereignty
over
the
barnwell
islands
between
1760
and
1956,
196
years.
and
by
interrogatory
number
55,
georgia
admits
that
there
was
no
dispute,
public
or
private,
regarding
the
territorial
jurisdiction
of
barnwell
island
between
1787
and
1955,
168
years.
south
carolina
exercised
the
unquestioned
jurisdiction
during
that
period.
georgia's
only
exercise
of
sovereignty
over
the
barnwell
islands
in
any
way
between
1732
and
1955
was
a
1760
grant
which
was
abandoned
and
a
possible
property
taxation
in
1825,
1830
and
1831.
the
special
master
found
that
this
1760
grant
or
his
estate
effectively
abandoned
this
property
within
several
years.
the
grant
actually
was
never
recorded.
there
is
no
recorded
grant
in
georgia
of
the
barnwell
islands
at
any
time.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
no,
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--your
honor,
there
is
no
trouble
there,
because
the
owners
were
savannah
people
living
in
savannah,
who
owned
the
land
and
went
to
south
carolina
to
obtain
the
grant.
they
put
rice
plantations
on
there
for
a
period
of
over
three
decades.
this
property
is
only
500
or
600
yards
across
the
river
from
fort
jackson.
it's
easily
seen
from
hutchinson
island.
it
is
seen
and
admitted
by
georgia,
from
the
city
of
georgia
itself.
the
documents
which
were
being
recorded
for
over
100
years
were
by
people
who
own
lands
and
property
in
south
carolina
and
in
georgia,
and
they
recorded
these
documents
in
georgia.
there
were
mortgages
involved.
they
had
georgia
factors
paying
the
taxes
to
south
carolina.
so
the
notoriety
of
this
is
totally
consistent
for
all
this
period
of
time.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
well,
it
was
brought
home
to
everybody
who
was
around,
including
the
aldermen,
to
the
city
council.
it
was
perceived...
we
say
the
islands
were
perceived
as
being
in
the
state
of
south
carolina.
the
grant
which
georgia
attempted
in
1760,
17
years
before
the
treaty,
georgia
never
did
it
again
because
of
the
perceptions
that
followed
certainly
after
that
treaty.
and
it
was
only
a
few
years
after
1787
that
south
carolina
granted
this
property
the
first
time
to
hezekiah
roberts,
in
1795,
a
grant
which
expired
because
it
wasn't
recorded.
but
in
1813
south
carolina
granted
it
again
to
archibald
smith.
he
was
in
savannah,
a
native
of
savannah,
a
very
prominent
farmer,
and
he
perceived
that
he
had
to
go
to
south
carolina
to
get
the
grant
of
the
barnwells.
and
so
from
that
time
forward
it
has
been
perceived
as
being
in
south
carolina.
we
have
quoted
20
different
observations
of
the
people
and
the
time,
historically,
as
where
they
saw
that
these
properties
were.
of
course,
at
this
long
period
of
time
we
don't
have
the
live
bodies,
so
we
have
to
go
back
to
the
times
and
how
they
were
perceived.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
absolutely
correct.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
with
respect
to
barnwell,
we
are
supporting
it.
now,
georgia,
as
i
said,
after
18...
1787,
never
made
any
act
of
attempt
of
a
granting.
no
one
has
ever
gone
to
georgia
to
try
to
perfect
any
grant.
nobody
has
gone
back
to
georgia
and
asked
for
another
grant.
and
when
the
south
carolina
granted
the
islands
to
archibald
smith
in
1813,
it
granted
three
islands,
described
as
islands,
as
marsh
islands.
incidentally,
when
the
first
grant
occurred
by
georgia
in
1760,
it
was
only
described
as
two
marsh
islands,
and
there
were
only
two
in
existence.
the
tax
books
in
georgia
perhaps
show
payment
of
taxes
in
1825,
1830
and
1831.
and
described
in
that
is
land
marsh,
land
marsh
and
three
marsh
islands.
may
or
may
not
have
been
these
islands.
but
the
grant
by
which
it
would
had
to
have
been
if
it
were
at
all
was
the
1813
grant,
of
course,
of
the
barnwells
from
south
carolina.
had
georgia
even
brought
this
suit
in
1900,
the
claims
of
the
barnwells
would
have
been
foreclosed
by
acquiescence
and
prescription.
and
further,
south
carolina
in
this
century
sold
these
barnwell
islands
for
non-payment
of
taxes
in
the
1930s.
and
the
commission
in
south
carolina
which
acquired
them
then
subsequently
conveyed
them.
and
the
chain
of
title
is
consistent
from
1813
down
till
this
very
day
in
south
carolina.
and
there
is
no
chain
of
title
in
georgia.
and
georgia's
argument
that
no
one
could
have
seen
them
in
exercising
this
sovereignty
cannot
be
true
because
of
the
unobstructed
view
of
500
or
600
yards
away
and
because
of
the
intense
interest
of
people
in
rice
plantations
and
in
farming.
the
barnwells
were
used
for
rice
plantations
and
planting
for
decades.
and
these
dike
fields
and
all
are
shown,
easily
are
visible,
cannot
be
ignored.
rice
lands
were
extremely
valuable,
nothing
more
valuable
in
that
area.
they
were
as
prominent
and
valuable
as
a
10-story
building
would
be
today.
no
one
thought
that
the
barnwells
were
ungranted.
no
one
appeared
in
georgia
and
said
give
me
a
grant,
and
no
one
in
georgia
said
we
have
got
untaxed
land
out
there,
the
barnwells.
no
one
applied
for
taxation.
the
barnwells
were
located
at
the
intersection
of
the
superhighway
of
that
day
in
georgia,
the
savannah
river
and
the
land,
the
road
which
carried
from
savannah
to
charleston,
the
most
prominent
city
in
south
carolina.
this
is
not
a
remote,
hidden
area.
it
was
opposite
the
city
of
savannah
and--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
no,
sir,
but
the
ferry
that
came
from
savannah
lands
right
by
the
barnwell
islands.
it
is
a
ferry
road
and
so
designated
back
at
that
time.
and
that
was
the
route
to
charleston.
so
from
savannah
you
went
right
by
the
barnwells,
and
of
course
any
boat
going
from
savannah
had
to
go
by
the
barnwells
to
get
on
out
to
the
sea.
so
over
and
over
the
smiths
and
the
barnwells
were
according,
in
chatham
county,
georgia,
their
property,
because
they
own
it
in
both
states.
it
was
ped
and
archibald
smith's
estate
when
he
died
in
savannah.
he
was
not
a
stranger.
and,
of
course,
later
on
there
were
acknowledgements
of
the
division
of
the
lands
among
the
children
in
the
1860s,
even
a
mortgage
in
the
1890s
between
them.
and
a
prominent
savannah
merchant
was
a
factor
who
was
paying
the
taxes
to
south
carolina
for
the
barnwells.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
south
carolina
was
not
a
party
to
that
case,
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that
south
carolina
knew
anything
about
that
until
that
case
was
decided.
and,
of
course,
the
fifth
circuit
has
no
jurisdiction
on
boundary
matters.
south
carolina
was
not
served
in
that
case.
but
in
18...
in
1955--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--well,
even
if
it
were
considered
that
way,
that
is
1955.
first,
south
carolina
filed
in
this
court
a
petition
to
decide
the
boundary
in
'55;
georgia
opposed
it.
it
was
refused.
south
carolina
filed
again
in
1957.
georgia
opposed
it.
this
case
we
are
here
for
today
started
12
years
ago.
so
you
have
got
a
period
of
only
20
years
at
most
in
which
georgia
could
have
done,
or
whatever
it
has
done
to
reacquire
what
it
had
lost.
and
i
say
to
you
it
cannot
obliterate
the
past
of
almost
175
years
or
more.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
we
bifurcated
the
trial,
and
the
case
did
start
in
1977,
and
filed
the
reports,
and,
your
honor,
i
could
not
go
beyond
that
in
saying
that
it
has
been
a
lengthy
matter.
the
record
is
full
of
perceptions
of
individuals
that
these
islards
were
in
south
carolina.
in
the
20th
century
south
carolina
has
continued
to
exercise
jurisdiction
by
law
enforcement,
by
south
carolina
wildlife
personnel
patrolling
the
barnwell
islands,
by
issuing
shad
fishing
licenses
for
nets
on
the
barnwells.
and
georgia
really
has
no
explanation
or
excuse
for
her
prolonged
inactivity.
georgia
has
now
abandoned
rabbit
island.
all
of
the
barnwell
islands
were
right
next
to
the
shore.
rabbit
was
one
of
them;
it
is
in
a
line
there.
whatever
reasons
have
existed
for
georgia
to
abandon
its
claim
to
rabbit
island,
vigorously
contested
in
the
trial
below.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
the
one
farthest
upstream.
and
whatever
its
reasons
to
have
abandoned
rabbit
appear
totally
inconsistent
with
its
efforts
today
to
assert
its
claim
as
to
the
other
islands.
you
see,
rabbit
was
one
of
the
two
that
was
in
the
tannant
grant
in
1760,
the
only
time
georgia
exercised
any
dominion.
the
other
islands,
other
than
the
one
next
to
it,
did
not
even
exist
then.
there's
more
evidence
of
inhabitation
and
cultivation
on
hog
island,
which
georgia
still
claims,
than
on
rabbit
island.
georgia
did
nothing
different
as
to
hog
island
or
long
island
than
it
is
to
rabbit
island,
which
is
abandoned.
and
georgia
says
in
its
brief
on
page
13,
note
6,
that
rabbit
island
is
in
south
carolina.
but
it
says
it's
not
there
because
of
accretion.
it
is
only
there,
apparently,
there
is
no
other
reason
given,
by
virtue
of
prescription
and
acquiescence.
and
the
master
said
that
only
rabbit
and
hog
existed
in
1787.
and
after
the
master's
report
georgia
abandons
one
of
the
only
two
which
existed
at
treaty
time.
if
you
refer
to
appendix
e
to
the
exceptions
and
brief
of
georgia
and
its
rebuttal
index
also
prepared
by
georgia,
you
will
see
the
clear
and
continuous
chain
of
south
carolina's
claim
to
the
barnwell
islands,
notwithstanding
the
efforts
of
georgia
to
list,
for
instance,
60
years
of
paying
taxes
in
south
carolina
as
a
one-line
entry,
and
georgia
wants
to
list
these
three
years
in
1825,
'30
and
'31
as
three
entries
to
bolster
an
attempt
to
finite
some
exercise
over
the
islands.
if
you
refer
to
pages
39
to
66
of
the
first
report
of
the
master,
every
phase
of
the
barnwells
is
covered
by
him,
from
perception
and
historical
and
title
and
so
forth.
now,
in
this
1955
circuit
case
which
georgia
seeks
to
claim
gives
it
some
rights,
the
special
master
object...
rejected
that,
saying
it
was
neither
collateral
estoppel,
and
it
was
not
res
judicata.
and
he
found
that
record
very
sparse,
which
it
was.
there
is
no
evidence,
as
i
said,
that
south
carolina
knew
about
that
until
the
litigation
was
over.
it
was
not
a
party,
not
served.
and
durfee
v.
duke
certainly
clearly
teaches
us
that
the
fifth
circuit
couldn't
bind
south
carolina
or
georgia
to
the
location
of
a
boundary
between
them.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
there
is
not
even
one
title
deed--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--except
that
georgia
was
not
even
in
the
case
in
the
beginning
and
petitioned
in
it
after
certain
preliminary
motions
had
been
brought.
and
georgia
in
its
brief
before
the
fifth
circuit
said
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
boundary
between
south
carolina
and
georgia
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
and
georgia
made
that
representation
in
its
brief
to
the
fifth
circuit,
and
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
decision
says
the
boundary
between
south
carolina
and
georgia
is
not
involved
in
this
case.
and
we
think
south
carolina
can
stand
on
that,
should
stand
on
it
just
as
the
fifth
circuit
accepted
it.
georgia
now
seeks
to
fault
south
carolina
for
participating
and
saying
we
lost
rights.
but
it
would
be
unconscionable
for
the...
georgia
to
have
gone
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
made
that
active
representation,
saying
there
is
no
boundary
involved
at
all
and
now
seek
to
have
south
carolina
precluded
in
some
way
by
virtue
of
that
decision.
and
again,
georgia
opposed
our
efforts
to
file
a
case
in
this
court
in
'55
and
'57
to
determine
the
boundary.
after
the
1880s,
the
next
75
years,
south
carolina
continued
its
taxing
and
sovereignty,
and
georgia
did
nothing
during
this
prolonged
period.
the
record
before
this
court
is
the
1787
treaty,
and
what
has
happened
since.
it
is
the
first
and
only
record
of
the
200
years
of
acquiescence,
of
notice,
of
records,
of
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
and
sovereignty,
of
law
enforcement,
of
grants
by
south
carolina,
of
continuity
of
title,
of
taxes
paid
to
south
carolina,
and
of
georgia's
total
unerupted
acquiescence
and
abandonment
for
well
over
100
years.
this
is
south
carolina's
first
day
in
court
on
that
boundary.
i
would
like
to
turn
to
denwill
and
horseshoe
shoal.
the
corps
of
engineers
has
been
working
since
1840
to
keep
the
port
of
georgia
open,
deeper,
more
accessible.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
pardon
me?
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
excuse
me,
the
corps
of
engineers
to
keep
the
port
of
georgia
open.
and
there
has
never
been
a
south
carolina
port
there.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
savannah,
georgia.
savannah,
georgia,
the
port.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
so,
all
the
dredging
and
all
the
erection
of
wing
dams
and
the
blocking
of
channels
and
the
diversion
of
streams
and
the
side
dams
and
the
training
walls
have
been
solely
for
the
city
of
savannah
and
its
port
in
georgia.
and
georgia
now
seeks
to
obtain
not
only
the
benefit
of
this
scouring
and
diversion
and
deviation
of
water
in
blocking
the
channels,
but
it
wants
to
say
that
deposits
now,
which
have
come
up
on
the
south
carolina
side
on
denwill,
is
georgia
land.
denwill
has
always
been
fast
land
in
south
carolina
on
the
northern
shore.
due
to
the
training
walls
and
silting
and
damming
and
deposits,
an
area
which
was
underwater
as
a
part
of
the
savannah
river
immediately
adjacent
to
the
south
carolina
bank,
has
now
become
fast
land,
totally
attached
to
the
south
carolina
fast
land.
and
the
master
did
recommend
that
this
area,
over
a
mile
long,
belonged
to
georgia.
now,
georgia
does
not
deny
that
this
new
land
resulted
in
part
from
natural
sedimentation,
reply
brief
of
georgia
5
and
7.
but
here,
because
of
these
manmade
devices
in
part,
the
contention
is
that
a
different
result
obtains.
if
this
be
corrective
course
on
this
type
of
system,
you
could
take
15
miles
from
that
city
on
down
to
the
ocean
and
block
south
carolina
off
from
every
bit
of
its
land.
south
carolina
did
not
place
this
fill
or
construct
these
training
walls,
so
it
is
not
involved
in
this
act.
it
was
not
an
evulsive
change
as
we
see
it.
it
occurred
over
a
period
of
probably

years.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
your
honor,
i
guess
some
relief
may
have
been
able
to
be
sought.
of
course,
i
understand
today
the
secretary
of
commerce
may...
have
the
determination
of
whether
the
corps
can
do
something
or
not,
but
no
action
was
brought
during
this
period.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
well,
or
the
city
of
savannah
suggested
it
need...
keep
its
scouring,
and
certainly
south
carolina
during
this
period
did
not
attempt
to
stop
the
corps
of
engineers
in
its...
whatever
authority
it
has
with
regard
to
navigability.
whether
the
fill
started
at
the
south
carolina
mainland
and
moved
into
the
river,
or
whether
it
started
in
the
river
and
moved
to
the
mainland,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
because
it
is
now
fast
land.
the
strip
on
denwill
and
the
strip
on
bird
island,
which
we
show
on
page
6
of
our
exceptions
and
brief
as
an
illustration
in
our
exception,
is
the
same
sort
of
basis.
we
excepted
the
master's
report
as
to
denwill,
and
we
excepted
that
it
is
fated
to
give
south
carolina
bird
island,
because
bird
island,
many,
many
times
larger
than
it
was
in
1787,
now
has
accretions
also
due
to
these
wing
dams.
same
argument
is
made
with
both.
i
want
to
say
to
your
honors
it
ought
to
be
rejected
as
to
both,
because
the
accretions
to
bird
ought
to
be
georgia,
and
the
accretions
to
denwill
ought
to
be
south
carolina.
we
did
this
because
of
the
inconsistency
in
the
report.
now,
south
carolina
has
asserted
that
islands
which
formed
on
the
south
carolina
side
of
the
river
after
1787
belonged
to
south
carolina.
that
involves
a
little
unnamed
island
upstream
of
pennyworth,
and
unnamed
island
just
south
of
pennyworth
known
as
tide
gate,
oyster
bed
island
and
of
course
all
the
barnwells
except
the
first
two.
there
was
perhaps
a
shoal
as
to
the...
as
to
oyster
bed
in
1787,
but
nothing
more.
the
masters
found
that
it
emerged
in
the
1880s
or
'90s.
now,
if
islands
emerging
after
1787
were
included
in
the
treaty,
then
there
would
have
been
no
boundary
set
at
that
time
at
all,
and
the
language
doesn't
say
after
emerging
islands,
it
says
in,
which
is
at
present.
so
it
would
have
taken
a
boundary
loop
to
even
gone
up
and
gotten
the
oyster
bed
shoal
in
1787.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
xxx.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
that's
a
possibility.
and
i
am
not
saying
that
georgia
may
not,
if
it
went
in
the
center,
have
even
some
greater
right
of
interpretation
there.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
this
is
unusual
language.
it
said
islands
in
the
stream.
we
think
that
the
georgia
people
went
there
with
the
idea
they
had
conveyed
and
granted
the
islands.
they
knew
what
they
had
in
1787
and
what
they
had
granted,
and
they
wanted
to
be
sure
they
retained
it.
but
the
masters
found
that
oyster
bed
island
didn't
crop
up
in
the
middle
of
the
stream.
it
cropped
up
on
the
northern
side
of
what
the
boundary
line,
as
he
was
in
1787,
and
so
we
contend
that
it
is
now
in
south
carolina.
it
is
in
fact
a
national
wildlife
preserve.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
well,
the
language
that
was
drawn
of
course
did
an
unusual
thing
in
reserving
islands
without
further
enlargement
of
the
language.
south
carolina
excepts
to
the
lateral
seaward
boundary
as
drawn
by
the
special
master.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
the
boundary
recommended
by
the
special
master
extends
entirely
into
waters
which
lie
opposite
the
coast
of
south
carolina.
no
part
of
the
recommended
boundary
is
opposite--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
he
did.
he
did
not
use
an
equidistant
line.
he
started
out
as
if
it
is
an
equidistant
line,
and
he--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--well,
it's
shown
on
the
same
exhibit
in
which
the
former...
he
just
moved
up
that
line--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--and
then
went
out.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
well,
he
took
the
mouth
and
then
he
moved
up,
and
he
decided...
he
started
it,
a
line
that
south
carolina
had
drawn
as
an
equidistant
line--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--between
georgia...
the
bound...
the
land...
land
formations
of
georgia
and
south
carolina.
and
he
started
out
on
an
equidistant
line,
but
as
shown
in
our
detailed
map,
the
line
of
equidistance
would
have
then
bent
southward,
but
the
master
did
not
have
it
bend
southward.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
am
talking
about
the--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--exhibit
b,
exhibit
b,
which
is
in
the
second
and
final
report
of
the
special
master.
exhibit
b
of
the
master
shows
a
series
of
lines.
and
the
master
started
out
with
line
number
5.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
well,
he
just
said
under
all
conditions
it
was
at
the
mouth
and
that
is
where
he
would
start.
but
he
started
on
an
equidistant
line,
as
drawn
by
5,
and
the
master
didn't
draw
his
line
on
any
map
after
that.
he
just
said
you
take
number
5
as
if
is
perpendicular
and
you'd
move
on
out
to
sea.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
on
that
perpendicular
line.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
and
it
is
not
equidistant,
because
line
number
5,
the
beginning
of
it
dips
down.
now--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--well,
the
opponent
wanted
to
slide
on
up
the
line
towards
tybee
for
three
miles
and
then
start.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
and
the
master
didn't
pay
any
attention
to
that.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
we
think...
our
theory,
your
honor,
is
that
the
coast
of
georgia
is
at
20
degrees.
the
coast
of
south
carolina
is
at
47
degrees.
the
coastal
fronts,
if
you
overlap
them,
going
out
you
have
the
area
in...
we
see
in
dispute.
and
so
we
are
saying
that
if
you
divide
that
between
those
coastal
fronts
you
would
have
an
area
of
123.5
degrees.
and
that
is
where
we
see
as
the
area
of
dispute
for
the
overlapping
nature
of
the
coastal
fronts.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
yes,
sir,
but
we
do
not
know
what
significance
this
line
will
have
in
the
future
days
as
to
the
200-mile
outrun.
and
of
course
every
degree
that
it
goes
up
is
going
to
make
that
the
difference.
for
instance--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--for
shrimping.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
shrimping.
heavy
shrimping
area.
and
that
is
one
of
the
reasons
this
suit
apparently
started.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
regulate
it.
control
whatever
is
underneath.
there
has
been
some
oil
exploration.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
if
granted.
if
owned
by
any
individuals.
the
line
of
the
master
is
six
degrees
farther
north
than
even
the
most
favorable
line
which
is
perpendicular
to
the
georgia
coast.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
there
are
licensed
shrimpers
in
south
carolina
and
licensed
shrimpers
in
georgia.
and
by
that,
of
course,
that
is
what
happened.
georgia
arrested
the
south
carolina
shrimper
to
precipitate
this
suit.
and
that
is
a
very
valuable
enterprise
in
that
area.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
he
took
that
position--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--the
master
simply
said
that
the
area
that
he
had
north
of
that
was
north
of
the
boundaries
that
existed
in
1787,
and
there
was
slight
water
going
in
that
area.
and
so
he
put
that
line
as
being
where
it
was.
these
maps,
the
accretions
that
have
all
have
occurred
since
1787
are
very
substantial
in
some
of
these
matters.
but
the
master
said
that
oyster
bed
was
on
the
northern
side
of
the
stream,
as
it
was
in
1787.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
he
said
that's
the
way
he
would
have
fixed
it,
the
boundary,
as
of
that
time,
based
on
the
best
evidence
that
he
had
before
him
as
of
that
time.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
well,
he
said
the
northern
stream.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
that's
true.
the
boundary
was
the
northern
stream.
but
he
said
oyster
bed
island
was
north
of
the
northern
stream
as
it
existed
in
1787.
and
our
position,
of
course,
on
the
lateral
seaward
boundary
is
that
it
should
start
at
the
historical
mouth,
and
the
mouth--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
the
mouth
is
really
between
tybee
and
what
you
might
see
as
a
shoal
just
north
of
that,
and
it
has
been
historically
understood
for
over
250
years
and
has
been
treated
by
all
of
the
observers
through
the
period
of
time.
william
debrahm,
for
instance,
the
most
informed
engineer--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--right
at
tybee.
right
where
the
intersect,
as
it
goes
from
tybee
on,
as
the
closing
line
starts
north.
and
all
the
historical
reports
have
said
the
mouth
is
at
tybee.
sir
james
wright,
the
governor
of
georgia
in
1773,
placed
the
mouth
of
the
savannah
at
tybee.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
that
is
the
language
they
used,
and
he,
sir...
sir
james
wright
used
actual
coordinates
that
placed
it
there,
as
did
william
debrahm,
who...
the
surveyor
who
put
it--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--it's
a
place
where
the
water
from
the
river
enters
into
the
ocean.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
the
north
boundary
has
always
been
considered
to
be
at
tybee
just
above
where
the
south
boundary
is.
it's
confined
in
there
on
the
ocean
floor
by
virtue
of
a
channel
which
has
been
there
historically,
and
that
has
been
the
place
in
which
ships
have
entered--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--half
a
mile.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
that
is
where
we
place
it,
along
in
there.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
yes,
straight
north.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
right
along
that
closing
line,
anywhere
right
in
there
would
be
the...
where
it
is.
because
it
has
always
been
referred
to
as
at
tybee.
and
that
was
the
way
it
was
perceived
in
that
time.
the
special
master,
in
the
boundary
which
he
gave
to
the
islands
of
georgia,
used--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--no,
sir.
he
didn't
start
it
there.
if
we
could,
if
you
turn
back
to
appendix
b
in
the
master's
report,
you
would
see
the
beginning
of
that
line
is
south
of
where
your
honor
is
mentioning.
it
is
in
about
the
midpoint
of
that
mouth.
if
you
look
at
appendix
b--
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
we
say
he
started
at
the
correct
place.
mr.
thomas
e.
mccutchen,
jr.
well,
i
see--
