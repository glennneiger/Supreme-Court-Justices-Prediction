well,
if
oyster
bed
island
hadn't
come
into
being,
this
line
probably
wouldn't
have
jigged
the
way
it
did.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
he
had
to
choose
which
side
of
the
island
to
go
on,
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
which
side
to...
he
did
go
halfway
between
oyster
bed
island
and
some
other
place,
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
shouldn't
he
do
that
rather
than
go
on
the
north
side
of
oyster...
oyster
bed
island?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
the
special
master
was
absolutely
correct?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
all
phases.
you
don't...
you
are
supporting
his
report
entirely
with
respect
to
barnwell?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
mccutchen,
why
did
it
take
so
long
for
this
case
to
get
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
rabbit
the
one
right
next
to
the
two
described
as
barnwell
islands?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
take
it
that
both
sides
object
to
that,
don't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
go
ahead.

perpendicular
to
the
closing
line,
didn't
he?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
where
did
he...
where
did
he
start
that
line
from?
did
he,
was
that
halfway
on
the...
halfway
between
hilton
head
and
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--how
far?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
far...
where
did
he
start
it,
though?
where
did
he
start
the
line?
what
was
his
principle?
the
line
extending
seaward--
justice
byron
r.
white
--between
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
what
was
his
explanation
for
starting
there,
or
did
he
give
any?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
that
perpendicular
line.
justice
byron
r.
white
regardless
of
whether
it
is
equidistant
between
the
coasts.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
your
opponent
insist?
justice
byron
r.
white
naturally.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
is
your
theory
that
it
should...
where
should
it
start?
where
should
that
line
start?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
is
involved?
jurisdiction
over
those
waters?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
in...
this
is
within
the
three
mile--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
is
that
area
that
is
in
dispute
of
commercial
value
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
fishing?
shrimping?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
interest
is
in
which
state
can
regulate
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
tax
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
could...
which...
i
suppose
some
state
can
tax
the
income
from
that
shrimping?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
mouth...
the
mouth
is
different
from
that
closing
line
between
hilton
head
and
tybee,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
mouth
is
where,
now?
north
of
tybee?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
tybee
is
a
big...
what,
at
what
place
on
tybee?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
mouth
isn't
a
point,
is
it?
it's
a--
justice
byron
r.
white
--i
agree
with
you.
i--
--south
carolina
agrees
that
the
south
boundary
of
the
mouth
is
at
tybee.
the
question
is
where
is
the
north
boundary.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
dotted
lines?
straight
north?
justice
byron
r.
white
straight
north,
or
along
that
closing
line?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
get
to
the
special
master's
findings
of
historical
facts
on
deference?
what
should
be
our
standard?
clearly
erroneous,
or
do
we
de
novo,
look
at
all
this
record
and
make
our
own
findings,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
suppose
if
we
accepted
all
of
his
historical
facts
there
would
still
be
left
the
question
of
whether
they
add
up
to
prescription.
