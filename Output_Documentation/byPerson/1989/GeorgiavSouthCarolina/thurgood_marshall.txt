--i
think
our
fairfax
county
clerks
would
know
that--
--did
georgia
ever
try
to
collect
any
taxes
on
either?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
when
last
did
they
try
to
collect
them?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
does
that
have
any
significance
to
us,
to
this
case,
now?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
i
don't
know
of
anything
more
important
to
a
state
government
than
taxes.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
there
any
place...
is
there
any
other
georgia
land
that
pays
taxes
to
south
carolina?
