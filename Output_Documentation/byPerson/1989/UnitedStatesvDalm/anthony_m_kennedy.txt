justice
kennedy
well,
can...
can
that
happen
now?
justice
kennedy
can
or
cannot?
justice
kennedy
and
perhaps...
perhaps
you
think
that
you
have
been
through
this
with
justice
stevens,
but
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
it.
your
position
is
that
if
she
had
filed
a
suit
for
a
refund...
i
know
she
didn't,
but
suppose
she
had
paid
the
income
tax,
filed
the
suit
for
a
refund,
would
she
have
had
a
right...
a
right...
to
recoup
the
gift
tax
previously
paid
even
though
the
gift
tax...
even
though
the
statute
of
limitations
had
long
since
run?
justice
kennedy
yes,
she
would
have
had
that
right?
justice

united
states
versus
dalm
is
a
tax
case.
in
1976
and
1977,
the
respondent,
frances
dalm,
receives
two
payments
from
the
estate
of
her
deceased
employer.
she
treated
both
payments
as
gifts
and
paid
gift
tax
on
one
of
the
payments.
some
years
later,
while
auditing
her
income
tax
returns,
the
irs
determines
that
the
payment
should
have
been
treated
as
income
for
her
services
as
administratrix
of
the
estate.
she
challenged
the
irs
determination
that
she
owed
additional
income
tax
in
the
tax
court.
now,
this
litigation
over
her
income
tax
liability
eventually
settled
with
dalm
paying
some
additional
income
tax.
based
upon
the
income
tax
payments,
dalm
filed
a
claim
for
refund
of
the
gift
tax.
the
irs
denied
her
claim
and
she
sued
in
federal
court
for
a
refund.
she
contended
that
under
the
theory
of
equitable
recoupment,
she
was
entitled
to
a
refund
of
the
gift
tax
because
the
estate
tax
payments
have
been
taxed
twice
under
inconsistent
theories.
the
district
court
dismissed
her
suit
on
the
ground
that
the
statute
of
limitations
for
seeking
a
refund
of
the
gift
tax
are
already
run.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
reversed
holding
that
the
doctrine
of
equitable
recoupment
applied
and
constituted
an
exception
to
the
statute
of
limitations.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold
that
the
doctrine
of
equitable
recoupment
is
not
an
exception
to
the
statute
of
limitations
and
does
not
by
itself
grant
the
district
court
jurisdiction
to
entertain
a
refund
suit.
the
doctrine
maybe
used
to
reconcile
inconsistent
taxes
when
one
of
the
taxes
is
properly
within
the
courtâ€™s
jurisdiction.
but
in
this
case,
dalm
litigated
her
liability
for
income
tax
and
then
in
a
separate
proceeding,
attempted
to
litigate
her
equitable
recoupment
claim.
the
doctrine
of
equitable
recoupment
cannot
justify
such
a
fragmented
approach.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan
and
marshall
join.
