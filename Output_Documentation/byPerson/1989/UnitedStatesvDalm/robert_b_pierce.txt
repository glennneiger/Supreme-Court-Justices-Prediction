mr.
robert
b.
pierce
mr.
chief
justice
and
honorable
justices,
may
it
please
the
court:
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
very
briefly
restate
the
salient
facts
to
bring
this
matter
into
perspective,
and
it
will
be
very
short.
in
december
of
1976
frances
dalm
believed
she
had
received
a
gift
and
a
check
was
sent
to
irs
on
the
premise
that
a
gift
tax
was
due.
that
was
in
december
of
1976.
in
1983
the
government
asserted
an
income
tax
deficiency
against
frances
stating
that
she
owed
$160,000
in
income
tax
plus
penalties
and
interest
that
at
that
time
would
amount
to
approximately
$300,000.
now,
contrary
to
the
nuances
in
the
government's
brief--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
the...
the
first
question,
why
was
a
gift
tax
not
filed
in
1977.
the
gift
tax
is
a
tax
that
falls
on
the
donor
and
i
believe
it
is
in
the
record
in
the
tax
court
proceeding
that
at
that
time
clarence
schrier
had
had
an
automobile
accident
and
became
incompetent.
it
was
the
duty
of
the
donor
to
file
a
gift
tax
return.
that's
why
the
gift
tax
return
in
'77
was
not
filed.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
the
donee
is
liable
secondarily.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
clarence
schrier.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
all
right.
contrary,
as
i
was
saying,
your
honor,
to
the
nuances
in
the
government's
brief
that
in
1983
that
frances
could
have
filed
a
protective
claim
for
refund
of
gift
tax,
that's
an
abstraction.
at
that
time
she
could
not
do
that
because
the
time
had
expired
then.
so
she
couldn't
do
it.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
your
honor--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--you're
getting
to
the
heart
of
the
issue.
the
answer
is
no,
and
the
reason--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--and
the
reason
the
answer
is
no
is
that
she
could
not
pay
$300,000
and
go
to
tax
court...
i
mean,
go
to
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
claims.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--she
lacked
the
money
to
do
that.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
that
is
correct.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
your
honor,
as
i
was
going
to
get
into
the
real
world,
the
majority
of
the
taxpayers
today
cannot
pay
the
tax
first
and
then
go
to
the
district
court.
they
are
financially
unable.
they,
therefore,
go
to
the
tax
court
without
paying
the
tax.
that's
the
reason,
the
basic
reason,
for
going
to
the
tax
court.
so...
and
that
is
exactly
what
happened
here.
now,
on
november
1,
19...
in
1984
she
did
petition
the
tax
court,
and
after
approximately
two
day's
trial
the
parties
settled
the
matter
for
exactly
one-half
the
amount
the
amount
the
government
claimed.
that
$80,000
plus
interest
then
was
paid,
and
that
was
done
prior
to
the
tax
court
settlement
becoming
final
and--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--there...
there
had
been,
yes.
and
i
think--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--there's
an
allegation
in
the
petition
that
the
gift
tax
had
been
paid
as
well,
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
there
was
a
claim
in
the
petition
that
the
government
had
received
an
economic
benefit
to
which
it
was
not
entitled.
there
was
oral
claims
for
equitable
recoupment.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
because
the
government
and
the
revenue
officials
threw
out,
denied,
any
credit
whatsoever
of
the
gift
tax
for
the
erroneous...
to
the
income
tax...
the
gift
tax
being
erroneous
only
upon
collection
of
the
second
tax.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
no,
your
honor.
both
claims--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--what
is
my
authority--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--number
one,
the
tax
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
equitable
recoupment.
this
court--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--the
tax
court
had
no
jurisdiction
over
the
doctrine
of
that--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--because
it
was
a
fact,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
we
believed
it
was
very
unfair.
we
believe
it
was
unfair,
as
this
court
has
held
in
one
single
transaction,
which
this
is
and
which
the
government
admits...
one
taxable
transaction,
two
taxes
on
inconsistent
legal
theories.
and
we
believe
it
was
unfair
and...
and
the
authority,
your
honor,
the
answer...
the
answer
to
that
is
that
the
taxpayer
had
a
cause
of
action.
and
that
cause
of
action...
she
has
been
denied
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
that
substantive
right
given
to
her
by
this
court
in
the
bull
doctrine.
and
that's
the
authority
for
the
situation.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
all
right.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
it
was
a
very
poor
deal,
your
honor.
and
it
was
a
poor
deal--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--it
was
a
poor
deal
for
the
taxpayer
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
could
not
take
the
chance
of
losing
and
going
bankrupt.
and
so
prior
to
this...
prior
to
the
litigation
in
the
tax
court
that...
the
irs
people
would
not
even
discuss
settlement.
it
was
only
after
trial
when
they
became
aware,
in
my
opinion,
that
they
were
going
to
lose
and
so
they
would
settle.
but
they
refused
any
credit
for
the
gift
tax.
and
i
think
that...
i
think
that
that
is
a
direct
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor.
in
any
event--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--why
did
the
taxpayer
settle?
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
the
taxpayer
settled
because--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--because
they
would
have
been
bankrupt
if
they
had
lost,
and
that
was
the
taxpayer's
very
words.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
because--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--we
believe
the
district
court
has
jurisdiction
to
rule
on
it.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
yes.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
accept
a
case
that
you
would
raise
the
doctrine
at
that
point
of
time
when
the
tax
court
lacked
jurisdiction.
and
it
seems
to
me
pretty
clear
that
the
tax
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction.
we
agree
with
the
government's
brief
in
that
respect,
that
the
tax
court
did
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
doctrine.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
this--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
this
is
the
only
way.
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
my
mind
how
the
issue
has
been
narrowed
by
the
government's
reply
brief.
and
in
the
government's
reply
brief,
it...
it
flows
well
and
it's
good,
but
we
think
superficially.
we
think
if
you
look
beneath
the
surface
of
that
brief,
it's
not
on
a
very
solid
foundation.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
absolutely.
i
was
there.
and
that's
a
factual
issue.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
i
don't...
i
don't
know
that
the
record
will
show
it.
it
would
have
to
be
on
testimony.
it
is
a
factual
issue,
and
that
is
why
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
for
that
purpose
to
the
district
court.
but
i'm
trying
to
answer
your
honor
as
to
what
the
facts
were.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
for
that...
for
that
limited
factual
determination.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
i...
i
would
like
to
point
out
some
of
the
government's
concessions
in
their
reply
brief
that
i
think
narrows
the
issue
for
this
court.
now,
the
government,
in
their
reply
brief,
said
that
she,
frances
dalm,
could
properly
have
invoked
bull's
doctrine
of
equitable
recoupment
to
diminish
the
amount
of
the
income
tax
deficiency
by
the
amount
of
the
gift
tax
she
had
paid.
in
short,
they
have
admitted
that
the
basic
elements
of
equitable
recoupment
are
present
in
the
dalm
situation.
they
admit
one
taxable
event.
they
admit
two
taxes,
two
different
taxes,
on
the
same
transaction.
so,
those
essential
elements
are
admitted
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
one
transaction
is
the
receipt
of
the
money
in
1976.
that
receipt
of
money--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--has
been
subjected
to
two
inconsistent
treatments,
inconsistent
taxes...
that
one
single
transaction.
those
are
the
tests
set
by
this
court
for
equitable
recoupment,
and
the
government
in
their
reply
admits
that
that's
present
in
this
case.
they
summarize
their
admissions
on
page
10
of
their
reply
brief,
where
they
say
that
both
the
payment
of
the
gift
tax
and
the
later
assessment
of
a
deficiency--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--their
reply
brief.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
it's
page
10
of
the
government's
reply
brief
on
the
writ
of
certiorari.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
this
is
on
the
merits,
your
honor.
on
the
merits.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
and
they
state
that
both
the
payment
of
the
gift
tax
and
the
later
assessment
of
a
deficiency
and
payment
of
the
income
tax
concerned
one
transaction
that
could
have
been
examined
in
all
its
aspects
without
offending
the
policies
underlying
the
statute
of
limitations.
now,
i'd
like
to
point
out
our
area
of
disagreement
and
our
area
of
agreement
here.
the
area
of
disagreement,
and
it's
a
big
area,
a
tremendous
area,
is
that
tax...
that
by
going
to
the
tax
court
that
frances
dalm
gave
up
her
substantive
right
of
equitable
recoupment.
the
areas
of
agreement
are
that
by
virtue
of
a
1926
law,
which
was
a
statute
enacted
before
this
court
determined
the
bull
case,
that
the
tax
court
decisions
become
final
as
to
the
taxes
brought
before
it.
we
agree
with
that
proposition.
we
further
agree
with
the
government's
proposition
that
the
tax
court
lacked
jurisdiction
over
the
doctrine
of
equitable
recoupment.
now,
with
that
it
seems
to
me
the
issue
comes
right
into
focus.
and
the
issue
is
may
a
taxpayer
be
denied
a
hearing
of
a
substantive
right
by
going
to
the
tax
court
which
had
no
jurisdiction
to
hear
it
on
the
merits.
that
is
the
issue,
and
that
is
scary
to
me.
the
government's
argument
is
very
scary.
they
treat
this
as
a
normal
situation.
they
treat
this...
this
situation
abstractly,
as
academic.
it
isn't.
it's
a
fundamental
doctrine
of
a
fairness
established
by
this
court.
that's
precisely
what
it
is.
and
that's...
that's...
they
are
not
treating
it
that
way.
what
they
are
saying...
and
the
only
way
i
can
illustrate
it
would
be
as
if
congress
had
enacted
a
law
that
provided
that
the
only
way
any
of
us
could...
could
contest
a
government
deficiency
would
be
to
pay
the
tax
and
then
go
to
the
tax
court
or
the
court...
or
the
district
court.
and
that
means
only
the
extremely
rich
would
ever
be
able
to
hear...
have
a
hearing
on
the
merits.
and
that
is
exactly
where
their
argument
leads
us.
and
that
is
not
true
because
this
is
a
cause
of
action
that
this
court
has
held
is
a
right,
a
fundamental
right,
and
protected
by
due
process.
and
we
submit
that
is
exactly
what
this
situation
is.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
the
government
would
have
put
them
out
of
business.
they
would
have
come
and
taken
their
property.
and
that
would
be
it.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
no,
your
honor,
we
would
not
because
the
only
method
of
doing
it
would
be
to
pay
the
tax
in
full.
you
have
no
right
to
go
to
the
district
court
without
payment
of
the
tax
in
full,
and
that
includes
the
interest.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--no,
you
could
not.
your
honor,
the
doctrine
of
equitable
recoupment
is
a
substantive
right,
and
without
that
there
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
for
the
proposition
that
it
would
be
a
lack
of
due
process?
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
no,
i'm...
no.
i'm...
i'm
saying
that
in
the
bull
case
itself,
that
court
held
that
the
right
of
equitable
recoupment
was
a
substantive
right.
at
page--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--no,
your
honor.
not
in
all
circumstances.
only
in
the
circumstance
where
you
have
a
single
transaction
and
where
that
single
transaction
has
been
subjected
to
two
taxes
inconsistency...
inconsistently.
now,
what
you
have
when
the
government
collects
the
second
tax...
you
have
a
cause
of
action,
and
you
have
a
cause
of
action
at
that
time
only.
the
cause
of
action
comes
about
by
the
collection
of
the
second
tax.
it
didn't
come
about
in
1976
because
frances
dalm
thought
she
had
paid
a
proper
tax.
it
came
about
came
about
when
a
second
tax
was
collected.
and
this
court
has
held,
as
we've
stated
in
our
brief,
that
a
cause
of
action
is
a
right
that
is
protected
by
due
process
provisions.
and
i
believe
that
was
the
zimmerman
case,
and
i'm
sure
there
must
be
other
cases
on
that
point.
and
that--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--your
honor,
i
would
refer
to
judge
hand
in
the
elbert
case,
that
i
believe
was
way
before
his
time,
where
he
said
one
does
not
lose
a
remedy
by
going
to
a
forum
where
the
remedy
in
fact
did
not
exist.
and
that
is
precisely
this
situation.
frances
dalm
did
not
lose
her
remedy
by
going
to
the
tax
court
when
that
remedy
did
not
exist
in
that
court.
i
would...
i
think
that
case
and
judge
hand's
decision
in
that
concurring
opinion
becomes
very
relevant
because
if
you
could
take
the
dalm
situation
from
the
present
and
lift
it
up
and
put
it
back
into
the
elbert
situation,
judge
hand
held
that
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction.
the
majority
court
did
not
hold
in
that
case
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
because
of
an
untimely
claim.
the
majority
in
that
court
held
merely
that
the
taxpayer
by
going
to
the
tax
court
could
not
then
later
contest
the
income
tax,
which
we
agree.
the
majority
opinion
there
merely
held
that
there
was
no
jurisdiction
because
there
was
no
allegation
that
a
gift
had
been
paid
and
equitable
recoupment
was
not
proper
on
the
merits.
but
it
is
here
in
dalm,
as
the
government
admits.
and
if
you
would
take
this
case
and
put
it
right
over
there,
you
would
have
a
decision
for
the
respondent
in
this
case.
and
i
think
the
case
is
very
material.
i...
i
disagree
with
the
government's
statement
when
they
challenged
judge
hand's
statement
that
this
court
held
that
the
statute
of
limitations
is
tolled
by...
in
the
bull
case.
this
court
did
not
hold
that.
in
the
bull
case
you
had
a
situation
where
the
taxpayer
had
been
subjected
to
an
estate
tax.
the
revenue
people
increased
the
value
of
the
property
and
subjected
it
to
an
additional
estate
tax
and
then
the
petitioner
taxpayer
argued
that
because
the
government
had
done
that
by
virtue,
in
effect,
of
estoppel
they
could
not
take
inconsistent
positions
and
assert
an
income
tax
that
was
inconsistent.
and
this
court
merely
said
that
that
does
not
toll
the
limits
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
but
the
way
the
government
states
it
takes
that
statement
out
of
context.
it
takes
it
completely
out
of
context.
what
has
happened
here
is
that
we
have
done
no
violence
to
the
statute
of
limitations
because
we
have
pursued
the
action
when
the
cause
of
action
arose.
and
i
think
it's
fundamental
that
no
statute
of
limitations
begins
to
run
until
the
cause
of
action
accrues.
it's
impossible.
and
that
alone
would
be
a
denial
of
due
process,
it
seems
to
me.
and
i
would--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--the...
the
principal
was
$160,000.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
with
penalties
and
interest
you'd
have
approximately
$300,000
at
that
time.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
no.
it
was
settled
for
80
plus
interest,
which
was
over
50
percent.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
but
it
wasn't
erroneously
paid,
your
honor.
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
it
was
erroneously
paid.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
in
fact
it
was
not.
it
only
became
erroneous
when
the
government
collected
the
second
tax.
it
wasn't
erroneous
at
that
time.
it
was
the
collection
of
the
second
tax
that
gave--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--our
position
is
that
it
was
a
gift.
our
position
throughout
is
that
it
was
a
gift.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
no,
your
honor,
we
were
not
wrong.
we
were
not
wrong.
it
was
settled
on
litigations
hazards.
that's
what
happened
here.
it
was
settled
on
litigation
hazard.
and
the
cause
of
action
arose
at
that
time
when
they
collected
the
second
tax
through
the
doctrine
of
equitable
recoupment
that
this...
this
court
gave
birth
to
in
the
bull
case.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
not
really.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
and
that's
the
situation.
i
think
the
government's
position
becomes
very
scary
to
me
because
it
is
a
denial
of
due
process,
and
that's
what
this
issue
comes
to.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
no,
your
honor.
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
doctrine
should
be
expanded,
as
the
government
seeks
to
have
you
believe.
the
issue
here
is
whether
it's
going
to
be
drastically
restricted
to--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--where
it
virtually
has
no
existence.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
i
believe
rothensies
restricted
the
doctrine
to...
to
where
it
should
have
been
restricted,
to
this
dalm
situation.
to
one
single
transaction,
one
taxable
event.
two
taxes
on
inconsistent
legal
theories,
precisely
this
situation,
which
they
admit...
all
they
say
is
that
we
had
an
opportunity
to
pay
the
tax,
which
is
not
true
because
we
couldn't
pay
the
tax.
and
that...
that's
an
unreal
world.
the
real
world
out
there
is
taxpayers
cannot
pay
the
tax
first.
congress
has
given
the
right--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--most
of
them
can't.
most
of
them
can't.
that's
why
you
have
the
system
the
way
we
have
it.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
we...
we--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--because
of
the
collection
of
the
second
tax
on
an
inconsistent
theory
treating
it
as
an
income
tax
transaction.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
the
whole
theory
of
the
case
is
that...
is
the
doctrine
of
equitable
recoupment,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
that
is--
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
--that's
correct.
absolutely.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
one
tax.
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
b.
pierce
that
is
correct.
i
would...
i
would
state...
i
think...
i've
got
five
minutes
and
i'd
probably
just
like
to
state
and
use
justice
o'connor's
language
in
discussing
equitable
estoppel.
i
would
paraphrase
her
language
and
say
that
the
government's
interest
in
the
simplistic
interpretation
of
the
statute
of
limitations
here
is
outweighed
by
the
taxpayer's
countervailing
interest
in
some
medium,
some
reliable
standard
of
honor
and
reliability
in
dealing
with
irs.
and
that's
what
you
have
here.
you
have
an
unfairness.
you
don't
have...
you
don't
have
tax
administration
on
a
high
plane.
you're
going
to
a
lower
level.
and
the
bull
court
opted
for
a
higher
plane
of
tax
administration.
i
believe
that
it's
an
absolute
certainty
this
court
give
moral
instructions
for
future
guidance
because
if
you
don't,
the
revenue
people
will
collect
the
most
tax
without
regard
to
principle,
and
that's
exactly
what
they'll
do.
i
think
that
my
time
is
about
up,
and
i'd
merely
conclude
to
say
that
my
grandfather
said
that...
he
was
a
circuit
rider
minister...
said
that
a
man,
if
he
had
anything
to
say,
he
could
say
it
in
30
minutes,
and
i
believe
that's
true
and
i've
said
it.
and
i
think
we're
right
and
i
certainly
hope
you
decide
the
case
for
frances.
