justice
scalia
--well,
it...
it
is
an
affirmative
recovery
against
the
government
in
the
sense
that
you're
talking
about
a
suit
for
a
refund.
justice
scalia
she's
paid
the
tax
and
she
is...
she
can
sue
to
get
back
the
amount
of
the
gift
tax,
although
it
would
not
be
described
as
a
refund
of
the
gift
tax,
it
would
be
described
as
a
recoupment
and,
therefore,
a
reduction
of
her
income
tax.
justice
scalia
well,
in
that
situation
the
government
wouldn't
have...
wouldn't
have
sought
to
convert
a
$200,000
gift
tax
into
a
$100,000
income
tax
anyway.
i
mean--
justice
scalia
--presumably
the
irs
would
have
been
quite
happy
to
have
her
pay
the
gift
tax
instead
of
the
properly
due
income
tax.
justice
scalia
they...
they
could
claim
that
alternatively.
that
is,
they
could
claim
recoupment
without
admitting
that...
that
it
was
properly
not
a
gift
tax.
justice
scalia
--don't
you
think
the
government
could
say
any
erroneous
taxes
you
pay,
too
bad?
they
could
tell
you
if
you
pay
a
tax...
if
you
pay
a
gift
tax
that
you
didn't
owe,
that's
not
our
fault,
it's
your
fault?
don't
you
think
the
government
could
say
that?
would
that
violate
due
process?
justice
scalia
well...
well,
if
they
can
do
that,
then
i
assume
you
could...
you
could
disallow...
you
could
disallow
recoupment
entirely,
couldn't
you?
if
you...
i
mean,
that's...
that's...
bull
was
less
than
that.
if
it
was
a
constitutionally
required
case.
justice
scalia
well,
what
if
it
was?
i...
i'll
stipulate
that
it
was
his
substantive
right.
but
that
doesn't
prove
that
it's
a
substantive
right
that
is
required
to
be
accorded
by
the
constitution.
it's
one
that
the
court
found
existed.
but
that
doesn't
mean
it
has
to
be
expanded
so
that
you
can
assert
it
in
all
circumstances.
justice
scalia
well,
even...
even
the
bull
case,
counsel,
says
that
the
taxpayer
has
a
right
of
restitution,
but
nevertheless,
he
may
be
without
a
remedy.
justice
scalia
your
cause
of
action
really
arose...
i
mean,
this
is...
this
is
recoupment
of...
recoupment
assumes
recoupment
of
something
that
you
had
a
cause
of
action
for.
i
think,
to
be
realistic
about
it,
your
cause
of
action
arose
when
you
erroneously
paid
the
gift
tax
and
had
a
cause
of
action
for
unjust
enrichment
of
the
government
of
sorts.
and...
and
basically
what's
going
on
here
is
an
extension
of
the
statute
of
limitations
within
which
you
can
assert
that
cause
of
action.
and
the
issue
we're
debating
is
whether
that
cause
of
action
to
extend
the
statute
of
limitations
can
only
be
asserted
in
certain
contexts
or,
as
you
contend,
must
be
able
to
be
asserted
in
all
contexts.
but
i
think
that's
quite
different
from
whether
you're
being
deprived
of
a
cause
of
action.
you
could
have
filed
for
a
refund
of
that
gift
tax
the
day
after
you
paid
it
on
the
basis
that
it
was
erroneously
paid.
justice
scalia
well,
it
was
in
fact.
they
didn't
know
it
was,
but...
but
in
fact
it
was.
justice
scalia
but
it
was
not
determined
to
have
been
erroneous
until...
until
it
was
determined
that
an
income
tax
was
due
instead
of
a
gift
tax.
but,
in
fact,
the
gift
tax
shouldn't
have
been
paid.
isn't
that
right?
justice
scalia
you...
you
were
wrong.
i
mean,
that's--
justice
scalia
mr.
pierce,
you're
arguing
now
that
the
gift
tax
was
not
wrongly
paid?
justice
scalia
if
it
was
not
wrongly
paid,
what
is
your
basis
for
recoupment?
justice
scalia
therefore
you
must
assume
it
was
wrongly
paid.
i
mean,
whether
it
was
adjudicated
by
the
earlier
court
or
not,
the
whole
theory
of
your
case
is
that
the
gift
tax
was
wrongly
paid.
isn't
that
right?
