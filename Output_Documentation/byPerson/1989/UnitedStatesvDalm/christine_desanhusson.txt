ms.
christine
desan-husson
yes.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
equitable
recoupment
can
confer
jurisdiction
on
a
district
court
to
hear
a
taxpayer's
suit
against
the
united
states
for
a
tax
refund
when
that
suit
is
otherwise
barred
as
untimely.
the
short
answer
is
no.
equitable
recoupment
is
a
defensive
doctrine.
its
logic
operates
to
reduce
a
claim,
a
currently
owed
claim
or
debt.
it
operates
in
litigation
about
the
amount
of
that
claim,
litigation
over
which
a
court
already
has
jurisdiction.
equitable
recoupment
must
operate
in
this
way
because
an
equitable
doctrine
cannot
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
a
district
court
beyond
its
statutory
limits.
here,
sections
7422
and
6511
of
the
internal
revenue
code
make
it
clear
that
no
suit
for
a
tax
refund
may
be
maintained
against
the
united
states
unless
a
refund
claim
for
that
tax
has
been
timely
filed.
the
refund
claim
for
the
gift
tax
at
issue
here
was
untimely,
and
nothing
in
the
doctrine
of
equitable
recoupment
changes
that.
the
dispute...
this
dispute
began
because
of
the
tax
treatment
of
a
lump
sum
payment
received
by
the
respondent
in
1976.
at
that
time,
she
was
serving
as
the
administrator
of
her
former
employer's
estate.
she
received
two
lump
sum
payments
from
the
brother
of
her
employer
and
the
beneficiary
of
his
estate.
in
1976
she
received
$180,000.
a
gift
tax
return
was
filed
and
the
respondent
paid
a
gift
tax
of
approximately
$20,000.
in
1977
she
received
approximately
$133,000.
no
return
or
gift
tax
was
paid
on
that.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
the
record
does
not
reflect
that.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
yes,
you
could.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
the
government
will
give
credit.
in
fact,
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
in
1983
the
internal
revenue
service
determined
that
the
amount
was
income
and
asserted
the
deficiency.
the
internal
revenue
service
can't
in
the
notice
of
deficiency
just
lop
off
a
certain
amount
because
the
amount
of
the
deficiency
is
statutorily
defined.
so,
that
amount
goes
off
in
credits
or
recoupment
can't
be
performed.
the
service
could...
does
have
the
authority
to
settle
a
claim,
at
which
point
it
may
make...
it
may
take
into
account
the
fact
that
a
gift
tax
was
paid.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
there
was
a
settlement
in
this
case.
in
this
case--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--it's
unclear
whether...
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
it
was
necessary
to
remand
the
case
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
settlement
had
given
credit
for
the
gift
tax.
it's
clear
that--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--well,
at
this
point
i
don't
think
any
court
has
jurisdiction
over
this
claim,
this
claim
for
a
gift
tax.
it's
possible
that
credit
was
given
in
the
settlement.
it's
also
possible
that...
a
taxpayer
can
also
file...
pay
a
tax
and
file
a
refund
claim.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
and
at
that
point
the
irs
will
give
credit,
will...
it's
given
notice
to
taxpayers
in
its
revenue
ruling
7156
that
it
will
at
that
point
perform
equitable
recoupment.
so,
it--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--it
can't
happen
now
because
the--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--cannot.
cannot
happen
now.
the
income
tax
deficiency...
the
way
recoupment
works
is
to
reduce
a
currently
owed
debt.
so,
it
could
have
reduced
the
income
tax
deficiency.
and
the
administrative
claim
that
would
have
been
timely
was
an
income
tax
administrative
claim.
at
that
point,
the
service
could
have
reduced
the
administrative
claim.
it
doesn't
have
the
authority
to...
to
consider
an
untimely
claim
for
the
gift
tax.
that
would
just
have
been
a
claim
for
a
refund
of
gift
tax,
and
that
was
outside
of
its
authority.
the
point
is
only
that...
that
the
taxpayer
had
to
litigate
the
income
tax
deficiency
and
seek
to
reduce
the
amount
of
the
income
tax
deficiency
because
the
gift
tax
claim
was
untimely
in
1985,
which
is
when
this
claim...
this
claim
began.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
well,
the...
the
district
court
suit
was
filed
in
'85.
but
the...
that's
right,
the
administrative
claim
was
filed
in
'84.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
i
believe
it
was
november
1,
1984.
but,
then,
i
was
just
saying
the
district
court's
was
in
'85.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
that's
right.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
if
she--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--if
she
had
paid
the
income
tax
and
filed
the
income
tax
refund,
she
could
have--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--well,
one...
excuse
me...
once...
once
the
claim
was
in
the
tax
court,
the
tax
court
has
jurisdiction
over
that
claim.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
if
she
hadn't
gone
to
tax
court
in
1983--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--right.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
i...
i
believe
what
would
have
happened
is
that
the
service
would
have
considered...
the
way
you
stated
it,
would
have
considered
under
number
one
that
what
in
fact
had
happened
was
that
the
taxpayer
was
filing
a
refund
claim
for
the
income
tax.
and
it
would
then
have
used
the
gift
tax,
the
payment
of
the
gift
tax,
as
an
equitable
reason
why
the
income
tax
could
be
reduced.
so
she
would
have
gotten
credit.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
yes.
i
believe
if
count
2
constituted
a
gift
tax
refund
claim,
it
wouldn't
have
had
the
authority
to
do
otherwise.
it
wouldn't
have
had
the
authority
under
its
section
6402
of
the
code.
when--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--i
don't
think
that
the
irs
would
have
done
that.
i
mean,--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--she
did
have
a
right.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
and
if...
if
for
some
reason
the
service
hadn't
given
her
the...
hadn't
reduced
the
$100,000
by
$30,000,
she
could
have
filed
suit
in
the
district
court.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
and
the
district
court
would--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--i
wouldn't
call
it
a
refund
claim.
i
think...
the
distinction
that--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--she
had
a
right
to
have
her
income
tax
reduced
by
$30,000.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
she
couldn't
do
it
by
way
of
an
independent
action
for
the
gift
tax.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
what
i'm
trying
to--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--what
i'm
trying
to...
the
distinction
i'm
trying
to
draw
is
that
the
difference
between
an
independent
suit
for
the
gift
tax
and
a
suit
for
the
income
tax
is
not
a
subtle
distinction.
it's
a
distinction
on
which
jurisdiction
rests.
specifically,
the
tucker
act
gives
the
district
courts
jurisdiction
over
a
tax
refund
suit.
however,
that
jurisdiction
is
expressly
limited
by
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code.
section
7422(a)
provides
that
no
suit
or
proceeding
shall
be
maintained
in
any
court
for
a
tax
refund
unless
an
administrative
claim
has
been
duly
filed
according
to
relevant
law.
now,
section
6511(a)
of
the
code
in
turn
specifies
that
an
administrative
claim
for
a
refund
must
be
filed
within
three
years
of
the
time
the
return
is
filed
or
within
two
years
of
the
time
a
return
is
paid.
that
is,
the
limiting
words
of
the
statute
are
express
and
make
it
explicit--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--well,
the
theory
of
equitable
recoupment...
i
mean,
it
could
be
that--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--under...
the
court
explained
in
bull
that
it
considered
her
a
defendant.
that
is,
as
the
court
put
it
in
bull,
a
collection...
there
could
be
a
hypothetical
collection
action
by
the
government
in
which
equitable
recoupment
was
raised
as
a
defense.
but
under
current
revenue
procedures
the
government
goes
ahead
and
summarily
collects
tax,
and
the
refund
suit
for
that
tax
is
functionally
a
defense.
it's
the
taxpayer's
opportunity
to
litigate
the
amount
of
the
income
tax
deficiency
due.
so
that
in
that
refund
action,
in
an
action
here
for
the
income
tax
deficiency,
the
taxpayer
could
raise
an
equitable
recoupment
claim
and
it
would
be
functioning
according
to
this
court's
reasoning
in
bull
as
a
defense.
it
would
be
an
equitable
reason
why
the
income
tax
should
be
reduced.
now,
i
would
note
that--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--no.
no.
recoupment
is
always
limited
by
the
amount
of
the
affirmative
claim.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
in
the
sense
that
the
government--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--that's
right.
i
mean,
the
government
would
have
to
write
her
a
check
because
it
already
had
her
money.
i
was--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--yes.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
yes,
she
would
have.
and--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--no.
no.
i
mean,
in
any
other
way
the
gift
tax...
the
claim
for
the
gift
tax
as
an
independent...
as
a
counterclaim
in
that
kind
of
situation,
is
barred.
and
in
this...
in
that
situation
this
taxpayer
is
not
in
any
different
posture
than
any
other
taxpayer
for
whom
the
statute
of
limitations
has
barred.
and
she's
simply
lost
a
meritorious
claim.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
well,--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--well,
presumably
they
would
have
assessed
whatever
they
thought
the
correct
deficiency
was.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
that's
right.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
well,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
record
in
this
case
that
indicates
that
the
service
acted
incorrectly.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
well,
the
decision
was
correct
in
bull.
to
play
this
out
a
little
further--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--oh.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
it
was
supposedly
an
executor's
fee.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
that's
right.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
that's
right.
and
that
was
litigated
in
the
tax
court.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
but
that's
not
before
the
court.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
to
play
this
out
a
little
farther,
just
to
make
sure
that
the
theory...
i'm
getting
across
the
theory,
once
the
respondent
petitioned
the
tax
court,
she
was
in
a
forum
that
this
court
has
considered
to
be
without
equitable
powers
to
apply
equitable
recoupment.
in
theory
she
could
have
raised
her
equitable
recoupment
claim
there
because
she
at
least
would
have
been
in
the
middle
of
the
right
litigation.
she
would
have
been
in
litigation
about
the
income
tax
deficiency
and
she
could
have
argued
that
the
income
tax
should
be
recomputed
because
it
didn't
correctly
reflect
equitable
reasons,
in
this
case
the
fact
that
a
gift
tax
had
already
been
paid.
the
district...
the
tax
court
would
have
had
jurisdiction
and
this
case
would
have
been
about
whether
it
could
apply
equitable
recoupment
and
it
would
have
been
about
gooch
milling,
the
old
case
in
this
court.
but
that
case
turned
on
somewhat
different
facts
and
there
may
have
been
an
argument.
in
short,
the
respondent
could
have
raised
her
claim
in
the
district
court;
she
could
have
attempted
to
raise
her
claim
in
the
tax
court.
what
she
couldn't
do
was
conduct
her
challenge
to
the
income
tax
deficiency--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--that's
the
gooch
milling
case.
my
only
point
was
that
in
theory
she
could
raise
it.
in
fact,
i
think
that
case...
that
case
turned
on
very
different
facts,
and
their
reasoning
was
quite
specific
to
the
facts.
and
there
is
a
reasonable
legal
argument.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
it
would
have
been
proper
to
raise
it.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
i'm
not...
i'm
not
taking
any
position
on
what
the
result
would
be.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
i
just
mean--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--excuse
me.
i
just--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--i
just
mean
jurisdictionally.
that
our
main
point
here
is
that
the
district
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
over
this...
this
case.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
i
think
that
the...
it
wouldn't
have
been
a
refund.
it
would
have
been
a
recoupment
claim.
and
i
think
that
the
litigation
then
would
have
gone
up
on
whether
this
court
followed
gooch
milling
or
not
is
a
different
question.
i
was
only
trying
to
make
the
jurisdictional
point
and
i
don't
mean
to
convert
this
into
a
discussion
of
what
the
recoupment
powers
of
the
tax
court
are.
in
any
event,
what
the
respondent
couldn't
do
was
conduct
the
entire
litigation
about
the
income
tax
deficiency
and
then,
independently
of
that
challenge,
raise
the
gift
tax
refund
claim
later.
nothing
but
the
income
tax--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--right.
it
doesn't
matter.
it
could
have
been
concurrently--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--with
the
income
tax
litigation.
it
would
have
been
separate
from
that
litigation.
and
once
that
litigation
was
going...
in
fact,
in
this
case
it's
exceptionally
clear.
there's
a
provision
in
the
code,
section
6512,
which
provides
that
once
a
petition
has
been
filed
in
the
tax
court
no
suit
for
recovery
of
any
part
of
the
tax
at
issue
there
can
be
filed
in
another
court.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
that's
right.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
that's
right.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
it's
barred.
and
this
provision
makes
it
clear
that
once
you're
in
tax
court,
you
have
to
litigate
out
completely
the
income
tax
deficiency
in
that
court.
so
that
there
was
no...
there
could
be
no
other
litigation,
no
subsequent
litigation
after
the
tax
court
proceeding
about
any
part
of
the
income
tax
deficiency.
or,
conversely,
if
in
fact
in
substance
this
proceeding
was
about
the
income
tax
deficiency
in
order
to
be
consistent
with
equitable
recoupment
theory,
then
it
violated
this
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code
that
says
all...
that
that
litigation
had
to
be
in
the
tax
court.
the
court
of
appeals
had
no
jurisdiction
to
reach
the
equities
of
the
situation
here.
but
it's
worth
noting
that
congress'
decision
to
limit
jurisdiction
in
this
case
is
also
based
on
the
equities
as
well
as
on
other
needs
of
the
government.
statutes
of
limitation
are
necessary
to
promote
values
of
repose
and
finality.
we
recognize
that
they
can
work
harshly
in
individual
cases,
but
congress
has
decided
that's
the
price
it's
willing
to
pay
to
increase
the
fairness
of
the
entire
system.
in
this
case,
i
would
maintain
that
the
situation
is
not
as
troubling
as
in
many
others
because
respondent
was
actually
in
a
better
position
that
other
taxpayers.
this
was
the
type
of
overpayment
that
she
had
a
chance
to
recoup.
she
had
alternatives
available
to
her.
we've
already
talked
about
the
alternatives
in
court
and
i've
reviewed
the
administrative
alternatives.
in
short,
respondent
had
her
opportunity
to
litigate
the
amount
of
the
income
tax
deficiency.
nothing
about
the
defenses
that
could
have
been
raised
in
that
litigation
give
the
courts
jurisdiction
over
this
litigation.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
that's
right.
it
was
a
very
big
mistake.
i
think
it
was
a
jurisdictional
mistake.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
yes.
that's
what
the
taxpayer
claimed
in
bull.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
if
she
had
gone
to
the
district
court
before
going
to
the
tax
court,
and
if
the
claim
in
the
district
court
had
been
a
claim
for
the
income
tax
deficiency,
she
could
raise
equitable
recoupment.
once
she
went
to
the
tax
court,
provision
6512
precludes
further
litigation
about
the
income
tax
deficiency
in
the
district
court.
so,
she
couldn't
have
done
that.
as
far
as
sort
of
the
larger
point
about
the
unfairness
of
the
tax--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--right.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
that's
right.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
that's
right.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
the
larger
point
i
was
just
going
to
make
is
that
i
think...
i
mean,
congress
decided
that
collecting
taxes
first
and
settling
disputes
later
was
the
way
it
was
going
to
build
the
revenue
code.
and
the
irs
actually
has
the
authority
to
work
out
installment
payments,
and
if
that
had
become
necessary--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--i
guess
that
would
have
been...
that
would
have
been
the
way
to
guard
access
to
the
district
court.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
you
can
do
that,
yes,
because
the--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--it's
unclear.
the
only
thing
i
can
say
from
the
record
is--
ms.
christine
desan-husson
--yes.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
that's
all...
that's
all
we
know.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
it's
irrelevant
to
the
equitable
recoupment...
to
whether
the
statute
of
limitations
had
run
on
the
gift
tax
claim,
exactly
what
was
decided
in
the
settlement.
the
point
is
that
the
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
reach
that
question.
ms.
christine
desan-husson
that's
right.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions--
