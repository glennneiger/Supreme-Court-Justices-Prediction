may
i
just
interrupt,
if
i
may?
1984
i
think
it
was,
wasn't
it,
that
they
filed
the--
justice
stevens
--i
thought
the
refund
suit
for
the
recovery
of
the
gift
tax
was
filed
on
december
1,
1984.
justice
stevens
which
was
before
the
deficiency
matter
had
been
concluded?
justice
stevens
and
is
it
correct
that
had
the
taxpayer
at
that
time
paid
the
income
tax
in
dispute
and
filed
a
claim
for
refund
that
the
taxpayer
could
have
recovered
the
gift
tax--
justice
stevens
--erroneously--
justice
stevens
--she
could
have--
justice
stevens
--well,
yes,
but--
justice
stevens
--if
instead
of
proceeding
in
the
tax
court--
justice
stevens
--she
had
paid
her
income
tax
and
filed
a
refund
suit
which
had
two
counts
in
it.
count
one
says
i
want
the
money
back
for
the
erroneously
collected
income
tax;
count
two,
i
want
the
gift
tax
repaid
also.
would
the
gift
tax
claim
have
been
timely?
justice
stevens
it
might
have
given
her
credit
if...
but
would
it
have
had
the
authority
under
your
argument
you
make
here
to
strike
count
2
of
her
complaint
and
say
it's
too
late
to
sue
for
the
gift
tax?
justice
stevens
assume
for
a
moment
that
the
income
tax
claim
is
$100,000
and
the
gift
tax
claim
is
$30,000,
so
we
have...
and
she
files
the
two
counts.
and
you
say
you
could
strike
count
one
for
30
but
would
they
then...
could
they
then
have
defended
the
100,000
on
the
ground...
the
$100,000
claim
on
the
ground
that
there's...
it's
too
late
to
get
the
30
back?
justice
stevens
well,
i...
are
we
relying
on
the
good
faith
or
sort
of
the
equitable
judgment
of
the
administrator
or
did
she
have
a
right?
i'm
asking
if
she
had
a
right
at
that
time--
justice
stevens
--to
30,000?
justice
stevens
and
she
could
have--
justice
stevens
--and
she
had
a
right
to
prosecute
successfully
a
refund
claim
for
the
$30,000?
justice
stevens
well,
she
had
a
right
to
recover
$30,000.
justice
stevens
so
she
could
do
it
by
an
independent
action
but
not
by
way
of
a
counterclaim.
that's
what
it
boils
down
to.
justice
stevens
but
as
a
separate
count
she
could.
justice
stevens
well,
okay.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
if
you
read
those
as
you...
literally,
that
would
bar
her
refund
claim
for
the
30,000
even
if
she'd
filed
it
in
connection
with
an
income
tax
refund
claim.
justice
stevens
because
it's
not
a
defense
anymore
at
this
point.
she's
not
a
defendant.
she
is
now
the
plaintiff
seeking
money.
justice
stevens
while
you're
interrupted,
could
i
ask
you
one
other
question--
justice
stevens
--about
the
fact?
is
it
the
government's
theory...
i
guess
about
a
third
of
the
estate
is...
we're
treating
as
income
here
if
we...
at
least,
that's
the
impression
i
get...
that
this
was
income...
taxable
as
income
because
it
was
on
account
of
services
that
she'd
performed
during
the
decedent's
lifetime,
or
is
this
supposedly
an
executor's
fee
or
an
administrator's
fee?
justice
stevens
a
third
of
the
estate?
justice
stevens
wow.
justice
stevens
and
that's--
justice
stevens
--yeah.
i
see.
justice
stevens
let
me
just
say...
i'm
sorry
to
keep
interrupting.
you
say
she
could
have
attempted
to
raise
it.
i
got
the
impression
from
your
briefs
that
it
was
not
at
all
clear
that
she
could
raise
it.
justice
stevens
well,
is
the...
is
the
government
making
an
unqualified
representation
that
in
this
set
of
facts
if
she
had
raised
it
in
the
tax
deficiency
proceeding,
she
could
have...
it
would
have
been
proper?
i
didn't
understand--
justice
stevens
--okay.
justice
stevens
well,
you
can
always
raise
anything.
i
mean,
it
was
proper
for
her
to
file--
justice
stevens
--the
refund
suit,
too.
but--
justice
stevens
--you're
just
saying
she
ought
to
lose.
and
i
think
you're
also
saying
she
could
have
raised
it
but
she
would
have
lost.
justice
stevens
but
i'm...
i
have
the
distinct
impression
that
they
would
have
denied
the
claim
in
the
tax
deficiency
proceeding
because
it's
not
a
proceeding
on
which
you
get
refunds
of
incorrectly
paid
tax--
justice
stevens
--but
again,
it
wasn't
later.
it
was
before
that
case
was
over.
justice
stevens
all
right.
justice
stevens
which
means,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
had
she'd
filed
her
gift
tax
refund
case
the
day
the
government
asserted
the
deficiency,
your
same
argument
would
be
made
here?
justice
stevens
yeah.
justice
stevens
okay.
