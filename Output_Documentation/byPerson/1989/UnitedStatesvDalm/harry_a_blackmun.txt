do
you
know
why
there
was
no
gift
tax
return
filed
that
year?
justice
blackmun
maybe
i
should
ask
your
opponent.
justice
blackmun
i'm
sure
that
the
service
has
not
been
this
charitable
always,
has
it?
it
certainly
opposed
daniel
bull
in
his
case.
justice
blackmun
well,
the...
daniel
bull
is
an
old
client.
[laughter]
and
i
remember
how
the
service
opposed
it
rather
vigorously.
justice
blackmun
mr.
pierce,
may
i...
may
i
interrupt
you?
the
same
routine
was
not
gone
through
in
1977
was
it?
no
gift
tax
return
was
filed?
justice
blackmun
and
why...
why
the
difference
in
treatment
of
the
two
years?
justice
blackmun
of
course,
the
donee
is
also
liable
secondarily.
justice
blackmun
who
took
the
initiative
with
respect
to
the
'76
return?
justice
blackmun
uh-huh.
justice
blackmun
mr.
pierce,
how
did
you
ever
effect
a
settlement
in
the
tax
court,
50
percent
of
the
asserted
deficiency?
it
sounds
like
a
good
deal
to
me.
