justice
white
and
so
it
was
just
a...
just
a
bad
oversight
not
to
claim
recoupment
when
they
were
talking
about
settling
the
income
tax
claim?
justice
white
and
there
was
never
any
mention
in
those
settlement
proceedings,
or
anything
else,
about
the
gift
tax
that
had
been
paid?
justice
white
yes,
what?
justice
white
well,
was
there
any
claim
that
the
service
should...
should
recognize
that
they
were
trying
to
tax
to...
the
same
event
twice
and
that
they
should
grant
equitable
recoupment?
justice
white
well,
then
why...
why
shouldn't
the
settlement
figure
represent
a
settlement
of
everything
that
was
involved?
justice
white
that's
all
the
money
that
he
had.
the
government
probably
settled
for
all
they
could
get.
justice
white
well,
why
did
you
settle?
justice
white
yeah.
justice
white
if
you
thought
you
were
going
to
win--
justice
white
--well,
but
if
they...
do
you
suppose
on
review
if
they
had...
if
they
had
lost,
do
you
suppose
on
review...
and
the
government
wanted
to
collect
the
income
tax...
don't
you
suppose
you
could
have
claimed
equitable
recoupment
in
reviewing
the
tax
court?
justice
white
why
not?
justice
white
you
say
the
tax
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
to
rule
on
it.
some
court
must
have
jurisdiction
on
it.
justice
white
you
mean
later.
justice
white
how
about
on
review
of
the
tax
court?
justice
white
so
you
say...
you
say
that
this
is
the
only
way
that
you
could
get
equitable
recoupment
and
that
you...
there
was
no
way,
as
long
as
you
didn't
have
money
to
pay
the
tax,
that
you
could
have--
justice
white
--tried
to
exercise
the
setoff?
justice
white
but
is
it...
is
it
clear
in
this
record
that...
that
the
irs
in
the
course
of
settlement
absolutely
refused
any
recognition
of
the
prior
payment
of
the
gift
tax?
justice
white
well,
i
know
you
were
there,
but
does
the
record
show
it?
i
didn't
know
that
the--
justice
white
--what
did...
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
to
see
if...
if
what?
that
the
government
had
refused--
justice
white
--well,
the...
so
you
did
claim
in
the
court
of...
i
see.
all
right.
go
ahead.
justice
white
has
the
government
assessed
you...
assessed
your
client
some
income
taxes
with
penalties
and
interest?
justice
white
and
if
you
hadn't
gone
to
the
tax
court,
what
would
the
government
have
done?
i
suppose
they
would
have
what...
put--
justice
white
--well,
at
that
point
would
you
have
had
any
way
of
asserting
your
setoff?
justice
white
uh-huh.
mr.
pierce,
you
don't
really
say
this
is
a
due
process
right,
do
you?
i
mean,--
justice
white
and
what
was
the
total...
what
was
the
total
income
tax
claim?
$300,000?
justice
white
and...
but
with
penalty
and
interest?
justice
white
and
you
settled
it
for
150?
justice
white
--well,
no
court
has
ruled
that
you
were
wrong?
justice
white
not
really.
after
a
two-day
trial
you
settled
it?
justice
white
at
least,
many
of
them
can't.
justice
white
well,
whichever
one
it
was--
justice
white
--it
doesn't
justify
two
taxes.
justice
white
it
was
either
a
gift
tax...
it
was
either
a
gift
or
an
income.
justice
white
and
there
was
supposed
to
be
one
tax,
not
two.
justice
white
well,
if
she
had
paid
the
tax
and...
and
went
in
for
an
income
tax
refund--
justice
white
--she
could
have
raised
the
recoupment?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
should
we--
justice
white
--can
we
judge
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
internal
revenue
service
did
not
give
any
credit
in
the
settlement
for
the
prior
payment
of
the
gift
tax?
justice
white
the...
our
adversary
said
they...
it
was
urged
that
the
service
give
credit
and
that
was
denied.
justice
white
but,
anyway,
we
judge
the
case
as
though
there
was
no
credit
given?
justice
white
so
you
say
it's
irrelevant
whether
they
gave
credit
or
not.
