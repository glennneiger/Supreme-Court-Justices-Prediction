chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-1951,
united
states
v.
frances
dalm.
mr.
desan-husson
you
may
proceed.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
right?
chief
justice
rehnquist
good.
it's
written
out
here
but
i
wasn't
sure.
chief
justice
rehnquist
could
a
claim
like
that
ever
be
not
just
kind
of
a
recoupment
or...
but
lead
to
an
affirmative
recovery
against
the
government
on
the
basis--
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
what
if...
if
in
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
instead
of
the
income
tax
being
$100,000
and
the
gift
tax
$30,000,
the
income
tax
is
$100,000
and
the
gift
tax
$200,000,
could
she
possibly
have
recovered
more
than
$100,000
from
the
government?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
lawyers
are
required
to
answer
hypothetical
questions
from
judges.
[laughter]
well,
but...
but
under
your
theory
i
suppose
the
government
would
not
have
been
diffident
about
asking
for
a
deficiency
for
the
extra
$100,000.
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
desan-husson.
mr.
pierce.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
if
i
sue
you
one
count
in
contract
and
one
count
in
tort
and
we...
in
the
middle
of
the
trial
we
settle
for
a
stipulated
amount
of
$80,000
without
specifying,
both
those
claims
are
barred
thereafter,
aren't
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
your
authority
for
saying
both
of
those
claims
are
not
barred?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
so
it
couldn't...
you
filed
this
complaint
and
alleged
the
government
had
gotten
money
was...
but
it
could...
the
tax
court
couldn't
have
given
you
any
relief
in
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
did
you
make
the
allegation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that
isn't
really
the
reason
you
ordinarily
put
something
in
a
pleading.
there
are
lots
of
facts
you
don't
put
in
pleadings.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
find
it
persuasive.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what...
what...
how
would
you
describe
the
one
transaction?
chief
justice
rehnquist
taxed
twice.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
brief
only
has
eight
pages,
as
i
see
it.
their
reply
brief.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
only
see...
i
thought
you
said
page
10.
chief
justice
rehnquist
oh,
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--merits.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what's
your
case--
--[inaudible]
authority
that
stands
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
bull...
you're
saying
bull
was
required
by
the
constitution,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
government
just
wants
the
statute
of
limitations
applied
equitably
to
all
taxpayers,
it
says,
so
that
everybody
gets
a
fair
shake
in
the
tax
thing.
you're
trying
to
come
in
at
a
time
when
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run.
and
you're
trying
to
take
advantage
of
the
bull
case
but
it
seems
to
me
you
want
to
expand
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--it
was
fairly
drastically
restricted
in
rothensies,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pierce.
ms.
desan-husson.
chief
justice
rehnquist
let
me.
go
ahead.
one
of
mr.
pierce's
points,
as
i
understood
it,
was
that
if
instead
of
going
into
the
tax
court
the
respondent
here
had
been
able
to
pay
the
tax
and
go
into
the
district
court,
she
would
now
be
in
a
position
to
recover
what
she
wants
here
whereas
she
isn't,
under
your
view,
having
gone
to
the
tax
court.
what's
your
response
to
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
about
the
larger
point?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
is
that
entirely
accurate
to...
you
have
an
$80,000
payment...
and
what
more
about
it
do
you
know
than
that?
that
there
was
no
credit
expressly
given.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
desan-husson.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
88-1951,
united
states
against
dalm
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
