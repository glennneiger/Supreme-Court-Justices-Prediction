in
theory,
if
the
government
later
decides
that
income

was
owing
on
it,
that
it
wasn't
a
gift,
should
the
government
give
credit
for
the
gift
tax
that
was
paid?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
was
some
settlement
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
that
give
credit
in
the
settlement
for
the
gift
tax?
justice
sandra

o'connor
but
you
do
avow
that
one
way
or
another
credit
will
be
given
for
the
gift
tax
that
was
paid?
justice
sandra

filed
suit
in
district
court
seeking
the
setoff
on--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
the
gift
tax
as
paid.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra

o'connor
you
mean
she
lacked
the
money--
justice
sandra
day

--to
pay
the
deficiency?
