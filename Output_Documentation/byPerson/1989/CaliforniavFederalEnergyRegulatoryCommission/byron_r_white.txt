justice
white
well,
literally
i
take
it
you
would
say
then
that
the
state
would
have
the
authority...
the
authority
to
require
a
license
from
the
state.
justice
white
even
though
it's
licensed
by
the--
justice
white
and
another
reason
is
it
was
perfectly
feasible
and
easy
to
do
so.
but
the
point
of
it
here
in
this
case
is
to
comply
with
the...
with
the
state
law,
at
least
allegedly,
would
amount
to
a
veto
of
this
project.
justice
white
i
know,
but
i
said
arguably.
justice
white
let's
assume
that
it
would.
justice
white
uh-huh.
justice
white
would
allow
the
state
to
have
a
veto.
justice
white
and
that
is...
i
think
that's
your
outright
argument
in
your
brief.
justice
white
i
know.
justice
white
well...
evidence
or
not,
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
it
would
amount
to
a
veto.
justice
white
well,
why
wouldn't
section
27
then
permit
it?
justice
white
well,
that's...
that's
all
first
iowa,
i
suppose,
meant
that
if...
if
congress
clearly
authorized
the
ferc
to...
to
build
a
project,
the
state
couldn't
prevent
it.
justice
white
oh?
the
federal...
the...
the--
justice
white
--i
see.
justice
white
well,
i
know.
i
know.
justice
white
where
is
this
project?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
do
you
think...
do
you
think,
really,
that
on
the
facts
of
california
that
it
was
inconsistent
with
first
iowa?
justice
white
yeah.
justice
white
well,
let
me...
let
me
put
another
way.
wouldn't
the
use
that
was
confirmed
to
california
in
that
case
have
been...
been
within
the
construction
of
27
in
first
iowa?
that
the
state
could
control,
namely
for
irrigation?
justice
white
under...
under...
in
first
iowa?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but--
justice
white
--what
was
the...
what
was
the
use
involved
in--
justice
white
--no,
in
first
iowa?
justice
white
been
an
irrigation
dam?
justice
white
--[inaudible]
suggesting
that
if
we
have
another
view
of
the...
the...
of
what
was
said
in
first
iowa,
that
we
overrule
it.
we
should
overrule
the
case.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
if
we...
what
if
we
think
it
isn't
just
dictum
as
you
say,
that
it's
holding.
you...
you
want
us
to
overrule
it,
don't
you?
justice
white
you
mean
you've
lost
so
far?
justice
white
but
you...
you
seem
to
agree
that
you
can't
just
take...
construe
the
section...
section
27
literally,
the
way
it
reads.
justice
white
and
so
how
do
we
go
about
sorting
out
which
controls
section
7
allows
the
state
to
impose
and
which
ones
that
it
doesn't?
justice
white
despite
section
27?
justice
white
and
so...
but...
but
that
means
that
the
state
can
set
a...
a
different
in-stream
flow
than
the
federal
power
commission
sets.
justice
white
and...
and--
justice
white
--and
then...
and
completely
veto
the
project?
justice
white
very
well,
mr.
walston.
mr.
nightingale.
justice
white
i
thought
you...
section
27
refers
to
the
state's
regulations
with
respect
to
irrigation,
municipal
use...
and
what
else
is
it?
justice
white
or
other
uses.
i
thought
your
position
was
that...
that
in-stream
flows
just
wasn't
one
of
the
uses
that
the
state
was...
was
protected
on
here?
justice
white
no,
no.
justice
white
but
isn't
it
your
position
that...
that
a
state
regulation
dealing
with
in-stream
flows
just
isn't
within
section
27?
