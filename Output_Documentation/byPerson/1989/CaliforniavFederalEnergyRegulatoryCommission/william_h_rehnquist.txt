chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
89-333,
california
v.
federal
energy
regulatory
commission.
mr.
walston.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
now
what...
what
do
we
know
about
the
effect
of
those
higher
flow
requirements
imposed
by
the
state
on
the
feasibility
of
this
project?
chief
justice
rehnquist
they
also
said
that
you
had
to
get
a
license
from
the
state,
didn't
they,
in
first
iowa?
you
had
to
go
before
that
board?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
mean,
i
thought
that
the
state
of
iowa
had
said--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--had
said
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yeah.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
nightingale,
is
it
the
government's
position
here
that
the
state
cannot
impose
any
requirements
that
the
ferc
doesn't,
even
though
the
requirement
wouldn't
constitute
a
veto?
chief
justice
rehnquist
supposing
it
sought
to
impose
a
requirement
which
didn't
conflict?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if...
what
if
in
this
case
instead
of
the
commission
finding
that,
you
know,
we
set
the
minimum
flow
because
we
wanted
the
minimum
flow
at
that
point...
we
wanted
this
kind
of
balance...
the
commission
says,
well,
sure,
we
set
the
minimum
flow
but
it
really
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
difference
to
us,
and
then
the
state
came
along
and
set
a
smaller
minimum
flow.
and
the
commission
can
say,
well,
that
really
won't
have
any...
make
any
difference
to
the
feasibility
of
the
project.
now,
is
that...
is
the
state
preempted
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
nightingale,
would
you
distinguish
california
against
the
united
states
on
the
basis
of
the
type
of
condition
that
the
state
sought
to
attach
to
the
use
of
water
there
as
opposed
to
the
stream
flow
requirement
here
as
perhaps
all
in
the
light
of
section
8
or
27?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
would
not
distinguish
the
two
cases
on
the
basis
of
the
nature
of
the
conditions
which
the
state
sought
to
attach?
chief
justice
rehnquist
xxx.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nightingale.
mr.
walston,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
walston.
the
case
is
submitted.
