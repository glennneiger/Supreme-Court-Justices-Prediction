justice
o'connor
--well,
mr.
claps,
what's...
what
has
been
happening
as
a
practical
matter
in
the
years
since
the
first
iowa
decision?
have
any
states
been
requiring
licenses
of
these
hydroelectric
projects
that
are
authorized
by
the
federal
government?
justice
o'connor
and
have
minimum
flow
requirements
been
imposed
by
the
state
since
first
iowa?
justice
o'connor
and
if
those
minimum
flow
requirements
make
the
project
economically
infeasible,
as
is
alleged
here,
that's
all
right?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think
that's
the...
the
language
and
understanding
of
first
iowa,
which
seemed
to
take
a
very
restrictive
view
of
the
meaning
of
this
particular
provision?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
know
you
think
that.
justice
o'connor
but,
let's...
let's
look
at
what
the
court
said,
nonetheless,
and
didn't
the
court
at
least
articulate
a
very
restrictive
view
of
the
meaning
of
the
section?
justice
o'connor
moreover,
you're
telling
me
that
nobody's
been
paying
any
attention
to
it.
justice
o'connor
now,
mr.
walston,
the
court
in
the
state
energy
resources
conservation
case
and
in
the
lajolla
band
of
mission
indians
case
has
described
its
view
taken
in
first
iowa.
and
the
court
said
congress
intended
to
vest
in
the
power
commission
exclusive
authority
to
issue
licenses
for
hydroelectric
projects.
and
there's
considerable
language
to
that
effect
in
our
cases.
now,
you
tell
me
all
that
is
wrong?
justice
o'connor
well,
then
in
the
state...
in
state
energy
resources
the
court
said
that
allowing
states
to
veto
federal
decisions
could
destroy
the
effectiveness
of
the
federal
act,
meaning
the
federal
power
act.
justice
o'connor
and
it
had
similar
language
in
the
lajolla
band
of
mission
indians
case.
justice
o'connor
well,
congress
has
had
before
it
now
the
language
in
first
iowa
and
the
subsequent
references,
and
has
done
nothing
to
change
that
scheme.
justice
o'connor
for
a
good
many
years.
justice
o'connor
but
we
assume
congress
knows
about
these
cases--
justice
o'connor
--don't
we?
justice
o'connor
mr.
nightingale--
justice
o'connor
--is
it
the
fact
that
states
have
been
licensing
these
hydropower
projects
and
engaging
in
the
kind
of
activity
that
the
state
seeks
to
have
us
confirm
here?
justice
o'connor
so,
as
a
practical
matter,
ferc
has
been
requiring
full
compliance
with
any
state
requirement?
