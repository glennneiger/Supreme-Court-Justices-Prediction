mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
state
water
laws
apply
to
hydropower
projects
that
are
licensed
by
the
federal
energy
regulatory
commission,
or
ferc,
as
it
is
commonly
known.
the
case
involves
a
dispute
between
california
and
ferc
over
minimum
flows
for
the
rock
creek
project
out
in
california.
california
has
established
higher
flow
requirements
for
the
project
than
those
imposed
by
ferc.
ferc
makes
the
argument
in
this
case
that
the
federal
power
act
completely
preempts
state
flow
requirements.
california
argues
that
section
27
of
the
federal
power
act
authorizes
the
state
to
set
its
own
flow
requirements.
california's
position
in
this
case,
i
might
add,
is
supported
literally
by
all
49
sister
states.
section
27
provides
on
its
face
that
the
federal
power
act
does
not
interfere
with
state
laws
relating
to
control,
appropriation,
use
or
distribution
of
water
used
in
irrigation
or
for
municipal
or
other
uses,
or
any
vested
right
acquired
therein.
california's
flow
requirements
in
this
case
relate
to
control,
appropriation
and
use
of
water
for
other
uses,
mainly
in-stream
uses
and
also
hydropower
uses.
indeed,
under
california
law,
in-stream
fish
flows
are
specifically
defined
as
a
beneficial
use
of
water.
and
therefore,
section
27
literally
encompasses
the
california
flow
requirements
in
this
case.
the
legislative
history
we
believe
makes
especially
clear
that
congress
intended
to
defer
to
the
states
preeminent
water
rights
authority
and
to
preserve
the
state's
existing
traditional
water
right
laws.
congress
indeed
has
traditionally
deferred
the
state's
water
laws,
and
in
passing
the
federal
power
act,
and
particular
section
27,
congress
intended
to
continue
the
same
tradition
of
deference
that
has
been
followed
in
the
past.
and
that
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
specifically
intended
for
hydropower
projects
to
comply
with
state
water
laws
to
the
same
extent
that
other
persons
must
comply.
congressman
doremus
stated
during
their
legislative
debates,
"water
power
companies
organized
under
this
act
will
be
obliged
to
be
obliged
to
operate
under
state
law.
"
congressman
mondell
stated
that
the
bill
disclaims
any
intent
to
take
over
control
of
water
from
the
states.
no
congressman
during
the
legislative
debates
offered
any
different
interpretation
of
section
27
or
suggested
that
the
hydropower
projects
are
not
required
to
comply
with
state
water
laws.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that
is
correct.
and
our
position
is
that--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--by
the...
by
ferc
under
the
federal
power
act.
yes,
that
is
correct.
the
scheme
established
by
congress
is
this.
section
4
of
the
act
authorizes
ferc
to
issue
licenses
for
hydropower
projects
and
requires
those
hydropower
projects
to
comply
with
ferc-imposed
terms
and
conditions.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
justice
o'connor.
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
492
hydropower
projects
now
in
california
that
have
acquired
water
rights
under
state
water
law
or
in
the
process
of...
of
acquiring
such
rights.
and
until
this
case,
no
hydropower
project
in
california
has
challenged
the
validity
of
california
law
as
applied
to
that
project.
and
therefore,
the
on
the
ground
status
quo
is
that
hydropower
projects
are
in
fact
complying
with
both
federal
law
and
state
law.
they
are
getting
licenses
from
ferc
and
also
getting
permits
from
the
state.
that
is
the
actual
on
the
ground
reality
that
is
occurring
today--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--the
states,
especially
in
california,
routinely
impose
minimum
flow
requirements.
that
is
a
common--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--that
is
correct.
that's
the
scheme
envisioned
by
congress,
justice
o'connor.
the
idea
that
congress
had
in
mind
was
that
hydropower
projects
had
to
get
joint
approval.
they
had
to
get
approval
from
ferc
under
section
4
of
the
federal
power
act.
they
also
had
to
get
approval
from
the
state,
pursuant
to
section
27
of
the
federal
power
act.
thereby,
the...
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
that
you
had...
that
the
hydropower
project
has
to
go
both
through
the
federal
process
and
the
state
process
and
has
to
comply
with
the
conditions
and
requirements
both
as...
as
a
condition
of
operation.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
first,
in
first
iowa,
we
think
that
the
court's
discussion
of
section
27,
justice
o'connor,
was
dictum.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
because
the--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--yes,
it
did.
and
if
this
court
were
to
sustain
the
first
iowa
court's
analysis
of
section
27,
then
we
could
not
prevail
here.
our
view
is
that
the
court's
interpretation
in
first
iowa
of
section
27
has
been
undermined
by
this
court's
more
recent
decision
in
california
v.
united
states.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
the
reality
is
that
hydropower
projects
have
in
fact
complied
with
both
federal
water
law
and
state
water
law.
and
probably
the
reason
why
they
have
done
it
is
because
the
state
water
laws
have
always
been
deemed
to
apply
to
hydropower
projects
to
the
same
extent
as
apply
to
everyone
else.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
we...
we
don't
believe
that
that's
the
case,
justice
white.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
okay,
well--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--okay.
if...
yes.
certainly
first
iowa
said
in
analyzing
section
27
that
the
states
could
not
impose
any
kind
of
condition
that
would
veto
a
project.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
our
view
in
this
case
is
that
the
court's
decision
in
first
iowa...
the
analysis
of
section
27--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--would
allow
the
state
to
have
a
veto.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that's
correct.
we
also
argue
that
the
state
is
not
imposing
a
veto
in
this
case.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
the
state
has
simply
imposed
conditions
that
require
the
project
to
meet
higher
flow
requirements
than
those
contained
in
the
ferc
license.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
don't
think...
as
far
as
i
know,
justice...
or
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
that
there's
any
evidence
in
the
record
concerning
the
effect
of
these
conditions
on
economic
feasibility.
i
do
recall
that
ferc,
in
it's
declaratory
order,
stated
that
the
project
would
be
economically
feasible
over
the
life
of
the
project,
but
not
during
the
middle
years
of
the
project
under
the
state
conditions.
but
i
don't
think
that
there
is
any
evidence
in
the
record
offered
by
any
parties
concerning
that
question.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
yes,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
potentially
that
could
happen.
i...
i...
i
don't
think
there
is
any
evidence
in
the
record
whatsoever
to
support
the
court
of
appeal
analysis
on
that
question.
once
again,
i
stress
that
the
idea
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
1920
was
that
the
water
project
would
have
to
go
both
through
the
federal
process
and
the
state
process.
and
indeed
this
was
ferc's
historic
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
section
27.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
what's...
i...
do--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--in
our
view
the...
the
state
laws
that
would
be
preempted
are
those
that
are
in
contrary...
contrary
to
clear
congressional
directives.
in
other
words,
directives
espoused
by
congress.
and
the
reason
we
take
that--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well,
i...
as
i
recall,
i
think
there
is
a
provision
in
the
federal
power
act
for
example
that
prohibits
monopolies
or
restraints
of
trade.
there
is...
there
is
an
anti-monopoly
provision
in
the
federal
power
act.
and
therefore,
under
that
provision
the
states
could
not
impose
any
condition...
or
state
could
not
authorize
a
cartel
or
a
monopoly--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--section
27
on
its
face
would.
but
in
california
v.
united
states,
this
court
said
that
state
power
under
section
8
is
limited
by
clear
congressional
directives.
we
assume
that
the--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--i...
i
think
that's
clearly
the
expectation
of
congress.
what
congress
said
in
the
legislative
debate
was
this.
it
said
that
the
states
own
the
water,
and
the
federal
government
owns
the
land
and
the
consent
of
both
must
be
obtained.
the
consent
of
both
the
state
and
the
federal
power
commission
must
be
obtained.
and
indeed,
that
was
ferc's
historic
view
of
section
27
and
the
federal
power
act.
in
19...
in
its
1930...
1927
annual
report,
ferc
described
the
effect
of
the
federal
power
act
as
follows.
at
page
20...
35
of
our
brief.
quote...
"the
development
of
water
power
on
the
lands
of
the
united
states
requires
the
approval
of
both
the
state
and
the
federal
government,
the
former
granting
the
right
to
use
the
water,
the
latter
the
right
to
use
the
land.
"
and
thus
the
expectation
of
congress
was
that
the
hydropower
project
had
to
go
both
through
the
state
process
and
the
federal
process.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
there's
specific
statutes
that
protect
the
public
interest
in
water
for
in-stream
uses,
and
particularly
for
the
protection
of
fish,
justice
kennedy.
section
1243
and
1257
of
the
california
water
code
specifically
provide
that
the
state
water
resources
control
board
must
consider,
and
to
the
extent
necessary
protect,
fish
needs.
and
it
also
provides
that
the
state
board
must
balance
fish
needs
against
the
needs
of
hydropower
projects
as
well.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
it,
comes...
the
riparian
doctrine
has
been
so
modified
in
california
now
that
the
same
conditions
that
apply
to
appropriated
use
also
apply
to
riparian
use
as
well.
and
therefore,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well,
the
state
interest
in
that
case
would
be
to
reassess
the
appropriated
right
in
order
to
protect
the
fish
needs
to
the
extent
that
the
state
determines
that
fish
needs
have
to
be
protected
under
those
circumstances.
of
course,
it's
always
a
balance.
the
state
of
california
is
not
in
the
business
of
putting
hydropower
development
out
of
business
in
order
to
protect
fish.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that's
right.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
is
correct.
california--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--but
the
project
couldn't
operate.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
because
it...
it
wouldn't
have
the
ferc
license.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
if
you
were
to
read
section
27
in
the
abstract
and
devoid
of
anything
else
in
the
federal
power
act,
you
would
come
to
that
conclusion,
justice
scalia.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that's
the
way
you
read
it.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
that's
not
the
way
you
would
read
it.
the
way
we
read
it
is
that
section
27
also
has
to
be
read
in
conjunction
with
other
provisions
of
the
act,
particularly
section
4
of
the
act.
section
4
of
the
act
specifically
provides
that
ferc
has
the
right
to
issue
its
own
permits
and
its
own
flow
requirements.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i...
i
understand
your
point.
i...
we
don't
make
that
argument,
justice
scalia.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that's...
that's
an
argument
to
which--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--no,
that's
not
correct.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
some
of
the
lands
involved
here
are
federal
lands
and
some
are
private
lands.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
but
the
federal
lands
are
administered
by
the
blm;
they're
not
forest
lands.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
but
they
are,
say,
partially
federal
and
partially
private.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it's...
it's...
it's
a
long
project
that...
that
covers
both
public
lands
and
private
lands.
it's
actually
on
rock
creek--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--but,
as
i
say,
part
of
the
land
is
federal
and
part
of
the
land
is
private.
the
most
important
point
i...
i
think
that
i
need
to
get
across
to
the
court
is
that
the
legislative
history
of
section
27
of
the
federal
power
act
indicates
that
the
provision
was
expressly
modeled
after
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
of
1902.
the
primary
author
of
section
27
said
he
copied
section
27
from
section
8.
and
in
california
v.
united
states
this
court
held
that
section
8
requires
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
comply
with
state
water
laws.
in
that
case,
the
solicitor
general
made
the
same
argument
on
section
8
that
he
makes
today
on
section
27.
he
argued
that
section
8
is
limited
simply
to
proprietary
rights.
and
this
court
rejected
the
argument
saying
that
that
argument
would
trivialize...
and
that
was
the
court's
word...
trivialize...
the
broad
language
in
policy
of
section
8.
and
since
section
27...
or
that
is
to
say,
since
section
8
requires
the
secretary
of
the
interior
to
comply
with
state
water
laws,
and
since
section
27
is
directly
modeled
after
section
8,
it
would
follow
that
section
27
requires
hydropower
projects
to
comply
with
state
laws
as
well.
in
other
words,
the
intent
of
congress
was
that
by
putting
section
8
into
the
federal
power
act
hydropower
projects
would
be
required
to
comply
with
state
law
to
the
same
extent
that
federal
reclamation
projects
are
required.
and
if
the
result
were
otherwise,
you
would
have
an
anomaly
and
indeed
an
inconsistency
on
water
rights
throughout
the
west.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
on
the
facts
of
california?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
we...
we
think--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well,
if
i
understand
your
question,
i
think
the
answer
is
yes.
in
other
words,
the
state
law
that
was
involved
in
california
would
fit
within
section
27,
if
that's
what
your
asking.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
not
as...
not
as
interpreted
by
first
iowa,
no.
as
interpreted
by
first
iowa--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--the
court
said
that--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--in
california?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
or
in
first
iowa?
the
state
there
prohibited
a
dam
that
would
have
been
an--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--would
have
done...
virtually
prohibited
all
dams
that
would
have
impaired
fish
in
any
respect
whatsoever.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
don't
recall
that
the
court
said
that--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--oh,
the
state
of
iowa--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
the...
the
state
of
iowa
in
the
first
iowa
case
argued
that
section
9(b)
of
the
federal
power
act
requires
the
hydropower
project
to
go
to
the
state
to
get
a
permit.
and
this
court
said,
no,
section
9(b)
is
simply
an
informational
provision
only;
it
is
not
a
subsidy
provision.
it
has
no
force
and
effect.
it
simply
gives
evidence
or
information
to
ferc
that
it
needs
in
the
licensing
process.
and
therefore,
the
court
said
you
don't
have
to
get
a
state
water
right
as
a
condition
precedent
to
getting
a
ferc
license.
that's
what
the
court
actually
held
in
first
iowa.
now,
that
holding
could
be
correct,
and
indeed
we
do
not
challenge
it
here,
and
the
court
could
still
sustain
california's
position
here,
because
in
first
iowa
the
court
did
not
consider...
or
i
should
say
anything
that
it
did
consider
concerning
the
effect
of
section
27
was
extraneous
to
the
decision
and,
therefore,
in
our
view
was
dictum.
now
certainly
the
court
had
a
very
crabbed
view
of
section
27
in
the
first
iowa
case.
but
as
i
have
said,
that
crabbed
view
is
inconsistent
with
the
broad
view
that
this
court
took
of
section
8
in
the
case
of
california
v.
united
states.
and
since
one
provision
was
modeled
after
the
other,
it
is
simply
incomprehensible
that
the
court
should
interpret
those
statutes
inconsistently.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
because
the
actual
holding
in
first
iowa
was
that
section
9(b)
of
the
act
simply
imposed
an
informational
requirement
only
and,
therefore,
that
section
9(b)
in
itself
did
not
require
a
hydropower
project
to
obtain
a
state
water
right
as
a
condition
precedent
to
getting
a
ferc
license.
and
that
was
the
whole
holding
that...
that...
that
was
the
question
that
first
iowa
put
before
the
court
and
that
was
the
holding
of
the
court.
anything
the
court
said
on
section
27
was
extraneous
to
its
decision.
and
indeed,
the
court
analyzed
section
27
only
for
the
purpose
of
distinguishing
its
broad,
quote,
9(b).
and,
therefore,
we
urge
this
court
to
not
overrule
the
holding
in
first
iowa.
we
think
the
holding
in
first
iowa
is
adequate
and
acceptable
and
not
inconsistent
with
the
position
we
assert
here.
we
rather
argue
that
the
court
should
disregard
the
dictum
in
first
iowa
concerning
section
27.
and
the
reason
we
assert
that
is
because
that
dictum
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
recent
decision
in
california
v.
united
states,
which
provides
an
entirely
different
analysis
of
section
8
which
was
the
progenitor
of
section
27.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
we
don't
ask
that.
if...
if
the
court
is
inclined
to
overrule
first
iowa,
the
court--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--we
want
the
court
to
disavow
the
dictum
of...
in
first
iowa
in
the
same
way
that
in
the
california
case
the
court
disavowed
the
dictum
of
two
prior
cases
that
had
interpreted
section
8
as
limited
to
proprietary
rights.
those
two
prior
cases
were
ivanhoe
and
city
of
fresno.
those
cases
said
that
section
8
is
limited
to
proprietary
right.
and
this
court
said
those...
that
analysis
was
dictum,
and
this
court
specifically
said
we
disavow
that
dictum.
we
ask
for
the
court
here
to
do
the
same
thing
that
it
did
in
california
v.
united
states,
which
is
to
say
disavow
the
dictum
of
first
iowa
in
the
same
sense
that
it
disavowed
the
dictum
in
ivanhoe
and
city
of
fresno.
the
first
iowa
dictum
concerning
section
27
is
remarkably
similar
to
and
indeed
as
i...
virtually
identical
to
the
dictum
in
the
ivanhoe
and
city
of
fresno
cases.
this
court
put
them
aside
and
came
out
with
a
broad
holding
that
reaffirmed
the
broad
meaning
and
effect
of
section
8
as
intended
by
the
congress
in
1902.
and
therefore,
we
ask
that
the
court
do
the
same
thing
here
in
the
context
of
this
case:
disavow
the
dictum
of
first
iowa,
allow
its
holding
to
remain
in
effect,
but
disavow
the
dictum
and
hold
instead
that
section
27
has
a
broad
meaning
intended
by
the
congress
in
1920.
and,
indeed,
federal--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well,
i...
i
don't
believe
that
that...
the
holding,
or
the
language
that
you're
describing
is
central
to
those
decisions,
justice
o'connor.
the
only...
the
main
language
this
court
has
invoked
in
past
decisions
relating
to
section
27
that
we're...
the
parties
are
concerned
with
here
today,
of
course,
is
the
language
in
first
iowa
itself.
the
only...
in
our
view,
the
court
need
do
no
more
than
simply
disavow
the
dictum
in
first
iowa.
that's
all
we
ask
the
court
to
do.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i...
i
don't--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--that...
i...
i
can
only
respond,
justice
o'connor,
that
that
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
in
1920
when
it
passed
the
federal
power
act.
congress
had
these
issues
before
it
and
the
people
in
congress
put
section
27
in
the
federal
power
act
by
a
very
narrow
vote,
eight
to
seven.
it
was
widely
discussed,
widely
debated.
after
it
was
put
in,
then
the
congress...
then
the
congressmen
who
were
behind
the
bill
proceeded
to
describe
its
broad
effects,
and
the
broad
effects
were
that
congress
was
going
to
continue
the
same
deference
to
state
water
law
that
it
had
always
followed
in
the
past.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
the...
no,
i...
i
must
respectfully--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--i
must
respectfully
disagree,
justice
o'connor.
i...
i
don't
believe
the
congress
has
ever
had
the
issue
before
it
recently.
the
question
of
whether
to
overrule
first
iowa
or
modify
first
iowa
has
never
been
presented
to
congress,
as
far
as
i
know,
since
the
first
iowa
case
is...
or
i
should
say
since--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well,
certainly
congress
knows
about
it,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
congressional
inaction
that
takes
place
several
generations
later
is
relevant
in
construing
the
original
meaning
of
congress
in
1920.
this
court
has
said
in
many...
on
many
occasions
that
you
cannot
use
later
silence
or
inaction
by
congress
to
explain
what
congress
several
generations
before
may
have
intended.
which
would
also--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well,
our...
our
view
is
that...
no,
we're
not
asking...
we're
simply
asking
the
court
to
consider
and
decide
this
case
in
the
same
way
that
it
considered
and
decided
the
case
of
california
v.
united
states.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
i--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--wait--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--we
certainly--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--we
certainly...
we
certainly
would
probably
would
have
pressed
the
issue,
but
i...
i
don't
think
that
we
would
have
gotten
as
far
as
we
have
gotten
today...
and
we
certainly
wouldn't
the
mean
argument.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
pardon
me?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that's
right.
and...
and
we
certainly
would...
would
not
have
the
main
argument
that
we
make
to
this
court.
the
main
argument--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well,
no,
we...
we
simply
ask
this
court
to
interpret
section
27
in
the
same
way
the
court
interpreted
section
8.
the
reason
the
49
sister
states--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--have
joined
us
is
because
the
states
feel
very
strongly
about
the
issues.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
perhaps...
you
know,
if
all
else
fails,
then
there's
certainly
that
remedy
available
to
the
states.
but
i--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well,
it's...
it's...
we
don't
think
that
we're
getting
a
change
in
the
law.
we're
asking
for
the
court
simply
to
interpret
section
27
in
the
way
that
congress
originally
intended,
and
i--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--yes,
but
what
has
changed,
justice
stevens,
i
think,
is
that
in
california
v.
united
states
this
court
took
another
look
at
those
issues.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
it
wasn't...
no,
and
it
wasn't
called
on
to.
and...
although
the
solicitor
general
did,
by
the
way,
say
this
case
is
just
like
first
iowa,
which,
of
course,
is
opposite
from
to
the
argument
he
makes
today.
in
fact,
he
urged
this
court...
he
said
you...
you
can't
overturn
section...
the
prior
decisions
concerning
section
8
because
first
iowa
has
already
decided
these
issues.
and
this
case
is
just
like
first
iowa.
that
was
his
argument
to
the
court.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
the
statutes
are
very
similar,
justice
stevens,
and
i...
i
cannot
accept
the
proposition
that
they
are
different
in
any
fundamental
way--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--pardon
me?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
all
right.
the
point
is
that
if
you
back
to
the
language
of
the
statutes,
section
27's
language
was
borrowed
right
from
section
8.
if
you
go
back
to
the
legislative
history,
the
legislative
history
indicates
that
congress
meant
to
take
section
8
and
put
it
in...
into
the
federal
power
act.
that's
precisely
what
congress
said
during
the
legislative
debates.
and
therefore,
if
it
is
true
that
section
8
is
not
limited
to
proprietary
rights
and
does
indeed
authorize
state
regulation
of
water,
then
it
must
follow
that
section
27
does
the
same
thing
in
a
hydropower
context.
otherwise,
this
court
is
in
the
unenviable
position...
unenviable
position
of
providing
a
different
interpretation
of
two
statutes,
one
of
which
was
modeled
after
the
other,
and
both
of
which
contain
the
same
language.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
and
neither
did
the
court
in
california
v.
united
states.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
the
court
should
treat
section
27
in
the
same
way
that
it
did
section
8
in
california
v.
united
states.
in
california
said
that
section
8
is
limited
by
any
clear
congressional
directives
that
on
its
face
or
implicitly
preempts
state
law.
and
we
would
therefore
urge
that
the
same
result
should--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--yes,
that's
correct.
did
i--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--it
could
only
set
a
more
stringent,
a
higher
standard
of
flow.
if
it
sets
a
higher
standard
of
flow,
the
project
has
to
meet
the
higher
state
standard.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
if...
if
the
reverse--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well,
it
could
lead
to
that.
of
course,
the
state
is
not
doing
that
here.
the
states
rarely
have
an
incentive
to
do
that
because
the
state's
own
citizens
are
the...
are
the
beneficiary
of
hydropower
development.
the
states
are
interested
in
promoting
hydropower
development.
but
they
are
also
interested
in
balancing
hydropower
needs
against
competing
needs
that
are
very
important
to
the
state
as
well.
the
state's
water
right
process
has
been
followed
for
many
years.
congress
has
consistently
followed
and
deferred
to
state
water
laws
and
this
court
has
consistently
sustained
congress'
judgment.
section
27
is
no
garden-variety
savings
clause.
rather,
it
is
a
fundamental...
an
expression...
an
expression
of
a
fundamental
principle
of
federalism.
and
that
principal
of
federalism
is
that
the
states
have
sovereign
interest
in
water,
and
that
the
states
have
the
primary
right
to
regulate
the
allocation
and
use
of
water.
congress
itself
has
traditionally
followed
this...
this
tradition
for
many
years.
this
court
has
sustained
congress'
judgment.
it
is
first
iowa
that
is
the
aberration
that
stands
out
there
all
by
itself.
therefore,
we
ask
that
this
court
reaffirm
the
enduring
principle
of
california
v.
united
states
and
reject
the
dictum
in
the
first
iowa
decision
that
we
think
goes
contrary.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
some
comments,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
understood
the
solicitor
general
to
say
that
the
ferc
licenses...
the
hydropower
components
of
federal
projects.
and
if
that's
what
he
said,
that
is
not
correct.
indeed,
ferc
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
hydropower
component
of
federal
projects.
but
on
the
other
hand,
under
this
court's
decision
in
california
v.
united
states,
the
states
do
have
jurisdiction
over
hydropower
components
of
the
federal
projects.
thus
the
ferc
argument
in
this
case
means
in
effect
that
the
state
can
regulate
the
hydropower
component
of
federal
projects,
but
not
of
private
projects.
and
this
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
us
at
all.
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
federal
project
has
much
deeper
federal
interest
connected
with
it
then
the
private
project,
where
the
federal
projects
that
state
law
is
applied
to
under
california
v.
united
states
are
authorized
by
congress,
built
and
operated
by
federal
agencies,
funded
by
the
american
taxpayer.
the
hydropower
projects
here,
on
the
other
hand,
are
built,
financed
and
operated
by
private
entities.
and
therefore,
the
federal
interest
is
much
more
involved
with
respect
to
federal
project
than
the
private
one.
i'd
like
to
briefly
go
over
the
hypothetical
that
justice
kennedy
had
in
mind
in
his
question
to
the
solicitor
general.
my
time
is
up,
mr.
chief
justice.
