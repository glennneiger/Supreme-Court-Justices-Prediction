justice
scalia
what...
what
state
laws
do
you
think
are
affected
by
the
federal
power
act?
justice
scalia
what
state
laws
are
preempted
by
the
federal
power
act?
justice
scalia
such...
such
as?
justice
scalia
but,
what
about
putting
hydropower
development
into
business?
if
you
assert
that
in-stream
uses
are
covered
by
this
provision,
surely
the
generation
of
power
is
an
in-stream
use?
justice
scalia
so,
i
presume
then,
if
you
read
this
section
27
the
way
you
read
it,
california
can
license
a
hydroelectric
plant
that
does
not
have
the
approval
of
ferc
because
it
says
nothing
herein
shall
be
construed
to
affect
or
intended
to
affect
in
any
way,
or
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
laws
of
the
respect...
with
respect
to
what
you
say
are
in-stream
uses.
justice
scalia
so,
you
don't
need
a
ferc
license.
you
can
get
a
california
license
for
a
hydroelectric
plant.
justice
scalia
why?
justice
scalia
you
don't
need
the
ferc
license.
it
says
nothing
herein
contained
shall
be
construed
as
affecting
or
intending
to
affect
or
in
any
way
interfere
with.
and
california
says
you
can...
you
can
operate
a
hydroelectric
plant.
justice
scalia
but
this
says
nothing
herein
contained
shall
be
construed
as
affecting
or
intending
to
affect.
justice
scalia
well,
i
know
you
don't.
justice
scalia
but...
but
it
seems
to
me
if
you...
if
you
allow
this
language
to
cover
in-stream
uses,
and...
and
i
don't
see
any
difference
in
that
regard
from
preserving
fish
or
generating
power...
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
the
whole
act.
well,
this--
--this
is
on
federal
land...
this
flows
through
a
national
forest,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
why
do
you
say
it
was
dictum
in...
in--
