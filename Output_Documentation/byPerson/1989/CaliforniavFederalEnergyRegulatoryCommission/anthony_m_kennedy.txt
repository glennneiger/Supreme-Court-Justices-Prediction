justice
kennedy
how
do...
how
do
you
describe
under
california
law
the
state's
interest
here?
simply
that
ownership
of
the
water,
or
is
there
some
descriptive
term
for
the
use
of
that
water
for
the
promotion
of
fishing?
justice
kennedy
if...
if
you
have
a
riparian
owner
who
wishes
to
use
the
water,
and
the
state
has
an
interest
in
preserving
fishing,
does
that
come
out
of
the
public
trust
doctrine
or
just--
justice
kennedy
--all
right.
suppose
then
you
had
an
appropriated
user?
and
that...
and
that
prior
appropriated
use
seemed
to
conflict
wish
fishery
requirement?
then
how
would
you
characterize
the
state
interest?
justice
kennedy
the
state...
the
state
argues
that
under
california,
where
the
state's
interests
are
represented,
what's
going
to
happen
is
the
same
water
and
the
same
stream
is
going
to
be
subject
to
really
a
differential
degree
of
preemption
that
doesn't
seem
to
make
any
sense.
you
recall
a
hypothetical
they
had
in
the
brief?
what
is
your
comment
on
that?
justice
kennedy
what
happens
if
the
dam
is
for
reclamation
and
power
purposes?
