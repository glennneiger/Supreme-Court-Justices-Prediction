mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
federal
power
act
congress
has
delegated
to
the
commission
responsibility
for
licensing
those
hydroelectric
projects
that
in
the
commission's
judgment
are
best
adapted
to
the
development
of
the
waterways
in
issue.
in
each
such
licensing,
the
commission
weighs
a
variety
of
interests,
including
the
requirements
of
interstate
and
foreign
commerce,
irrigation,
navigation,
the
environment
and
many
others.
the
question
presented
by
this
case
is
when
the
commission
has
undertaken
that
task,
balanced
those
interests
and
issued
a
license,
section
27
reserves
to
the
states
authority
to
prevent
the
judgment
from
being
put
into
effect.
now,
our
fundamental
contention
is
that
this
court
has
reached
and
resolved
that
question
in,
among
other
cases,
the
first
iowa
case
and
federal
power
commission
v.
oregon,
the
pelton
dam
case.
in
both
those
cases,
state
laws
were
asserted
that
would
have
blocked
hydroelectric
projects
that
had
been
licensed
by
ferc,
or
in
the...
excuse
me,
in
the
first
iowa
case
the
commission
had
expressed
approval
of
the
project
though
it
had
not
actually
issue
the
license
and
this
court
held
that
those
state
laws
could
not
be
applied
to
veto
the
implementation
of
the
project.
mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
the
state
cannot
impose
conditions
that
are
inconsistent
with
the
license
terms.
now,
in
this
case
the
commission
has
explained
how
its
minimum
flow
requirements
implement
a
balance
between,
on
the
one
hand
the
requirements
of
power
generation,
and
on
the
other
hand
the
protection
of
fish.
and
it
has
explained
that
in-stream
flow
requirements
different
from
those
established
are
inconsistent
with
those
of
the
state.
so,
our
position
is
that
the
state
cannot
impose
conflicting
conditions.
mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
if
it...
if
there
were
no
conflict
between
the
state
regulation
and
the
terms
of
the
license,
it
would
be
our
position
that
it
would
not
be
preempted.
assuming
it
was...
that
would
be
our
position,
yes.
mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
section
27
refers
to
state
laws
relating
to
the
control,
appropriation,
use
or
distribution
of
water
used
in
irrigation
or
for
municipal
or
other
uses.
mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
our
position
is
that
section
27
expressly
saves
state
law
from
preemption.
in
other
words,
if
the
state
law
is
one
that
falls
within
section
27,
it's
saved.
it's
not
our
position,
though,
that
the
federal
power
act
occupies
the
entire
field--
mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
--such
that--
mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
--yes,
in
this
case
because
it
doesn't
create
a
proprietary
right
in
water.
the--
mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
--your
honor,
i
think
it's
hypothetical
that
would
not
arise
because
the
way
the
process
works
is
to
channel
state
concerns
through
the
licensing
process.
were
the
commission
to
establish
a
minimum
flow
requirement
and
to
state
along
with
it
that
it
wasn't
prescriptive
in
any
sense,
i
suppose
there
would
be
room
for
the
states
to
do
different
things.
but
that
is
not
the
commission's
practice.
let
me
make
it
clear.
the
commission's
minimum
flow
requirements
express
its
judgments
about
the
appropriate
balance
between
the
use
of
water
for
hydropower
purposes
and
the
protection
of
fish.
it
does
not,
to
my
knowledge,
set
minimum
flow
requirements
without
meaning
them
to
be
prescriptive.
because
our
position
begins
with
the
first
iowa
case,
i
think
it's
important
to
lay
to
rest
the
suggestion
that
the
analysis
there
about
the
scope
of
section
27
and
the
preemptive
effect
of
the
federal
power
act
was
dicta.
in
that
case,
it's
important
to
recognize
the
court
accepted
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
the
state
to
comply
with
the
licensing
requirement
that
was
in
issue.
that
requirement
provided
that
the
water
for
a
stream
would
have
to
be
returned
at
the
nearest
practical
place.
and
the
essence
of
the
project
was
to
divert
the
flow
of
the
cedar
river
through
a
canal
to
the
mississippi,
effectively
dewatering
the
last
29
miles
of
the
stream,
so
that
there
was
no
suggestion
that
there
was
a
possibility
that
the
project
could
be
licensed
and
compliance
with
the
state
law
could
be
worked
out
later.
the
court
understood
the
case
in
those
terms.
the
questions
presented
included
the
question
whether
the
issue
had
been
superseded.
the
applicant
for
the
license
had
not
tried
to
get
a
state
permit
and,
therefore,
argued...
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding
it
relied
on
the
argument
that
the
requirement
for
compliance
was
preempted.
and
the...
the
court's
reasoning
in
that
case,
i
believe,
leaves
no
doubt
that
the
court
reached
and
decided
the
question
whether
the
state
licensing
requirement
was
enforceable.
and
in
reaching
that
conclusion
and
reaching
the
conclusion,
in
the
court's
words,
that
the
question
whether
the
project
should
go
forward
was
one
for
the
commission
and
not
for
the
authorities
of
the
state,
the
court
necessarily
considered
and
resolved
three
propositions
i
believe.
first,
it
analyzed
the
structure
of
the
act
as
a
whole
and
reached
the
conclusion
that
the
entire
scheme
was
designed
to
place
in
the
commission
responsibility
for
resolving
the
issue
presented
by
the
licensing
statute.
second,
it
found
that
section
9(b)
did
not
save
state
laws,
did
not...
despite
the
inference
that
could
be
drawn
from
the
remainder
of
the
statute,
section
did...
b
did
not
preserve
the
enforceability
of...
of
the
state
law.
and
finally,
it
reached
and
addressed
the
argument
presented
by
the
state
of...
iowa
in
that
case
that
section
27
independently
saved
the
state
law,
and
it
discussed
the
scope
of
section
27,
both
in
response
to
iowa's
assertion
and
because
it
was
necessary
to
the
judgment
in
the
case.
aware
that
section
27
was
there,
the
court
couldn't
very
well
find
the
state
statute
preempted
without
considering
whether
section
27
saved
it.
now,
any...
any
doubt
on
that
score,
we
submit,
was
laid
to
rest
in
the
pelton
dam
case.
in
that
case,
one
of
the
requirements
that
the
applicant
for
a
license
had
not
complied
with
was
a
state
statute
that
required
a
license
to
appropriate
water
for
the
dam.
and
the
ninth
circuit
had
held
in
that
case
that
the
ferc
could
issue
only
a
permissive
license,
not
a
license
that
would
confer
a
complete
right
to
build
the
dam.
and
this
court
rejected
the
argument
that
compliance
was
required.
and
i'd
like
to
refer
the
court
to
a
portion
of
the
opinion
not
cited
in
our
brief,
which
was
footnote
24
of...
at
349
u.s.
at
450
to
451.
the
state
statute
with
which
there
had
been
no
compliance...
the
permit
requirement
is
quoted
there,
and
the
court
noted
that
under
its
decision
compliance
was
not
required.
so,
i
think
there's
no
doubt
at
this
stage
that
first
iowa
set
out
the
analysis
that's
appropriate
for
determining
whether
state
laws
have
been
superseded
in
the
court's
words.
now,
justice
o'connor
inquired
about
the
status
quo
on
the
ground
in
light
of
first
iowa.
we
have
a
different
view
than
california
on
that
score.
we've
cited
a
number
of
decisions
in
our
brief
in
which
courts
have
consistently
applied
first
iowa.
i'm
referring
to
page
24
at
footnote
15.
to
our
knowledge,
there
has
been
no
case
in
the
lower
courts
in
which
a
court
has
taken
the
position
that
first
iowa
is
anything
less
than
good
law
as
it
purports
to
be.
so
we
believe--
mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
--well,
i
think
it's
considerably
overstated.
first
of
all,
as
a
general
matter,
we're
not
talking
about,
as
california
would
put
it,
two
systems
of
water
law
on
the
same
river.
what
we
are
talking
about
is
a
situation
where
state
law
will
have
to
incorporate
and
abide
by
those
conditions
that
are
established
in
a
ferc
license.
and
that's
not
an
unfamiliar
thing
for
state
water
law
to
have
to
do.
reserve...
federal
reserved
water
rights,
for
example,
are
taken
account
of
within
an
overall
structure
of
state
law;
there
are
federal
statutes
which
impact
on
state
water
decisions.
and
this
is
a
case
in
which
what
we're
talking
about
basically
is
where
state
water
law
will
have
to
incorporate
and
abide
by
the
prescriptive
conditions
in
a
ferc
license.
mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
if
congress
has
authorized
the
project
to
include
hydropower
purposes,
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
i
understand,
takes
that.
i'll...
i
understand
your
question
as
dealing
with
the
situation
in
which
the
authorization
extends
only
to
nonpower
purposes.
in
that
situation,
ferc
is
authorized
to
license
the
hydroelectric
development
of
the
project.
when
it
does
that
under
section
10(a)
it's
obligated
to
consider
the
effect
of
its
decision
on
various
beneficial
uses
of
the
water.
and
under
the
new
statute,
the
'86
statute,
the
electric
consumers
protection
act,
it
will
have
to
incorporate
all
re
ommendations
regarding
the
fish
and
wildlife
unless
it
makes
a...
an
affirmative
finding
that
they're
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
federal
power
act.
remember
that
when
we
think
about
hypotheticals
in
which
there
is
a
conflict
between
a
commissioned
licensing
decision
and
the
exercise
of
state
authority
in
this
matter,
that
it
won't
arise
until
after
ferc
has
first
balanced
all
the
interest
involved
and
its
balancing
decision
will
be
subject
to
judicial
review.
it
will
only
be
in
those
situations
where
ferc
has...
has
made
a
good
faith
balancing
decision
that
there
will
be
a
potential
for
conflict.
i
think
you
can
overstate
the
potential
for
inconsistency
if
you...
if
you
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
ferc
is
empowered
and
required
to
consider
the
effect
of
its
decisions
on
other
use
of
water
in
the
river
and
to
consider
under
ecpa
specifically
the
input
of
the
state
agencies
that
are
responsible
for
that
function.
now--
mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
--yes?
mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
yes,
your
honor
under
section
9(b)
of
the
act
an
applicant
is
required
to
submit
satisfactory
evidence
with
respect
to
compliance
with
state
laws
and
it's
been
ferc's
practice
to
look
for
that
evidence.
the
act
requires
applicants
to
go
through
the
application
procedure
in
effect.
ferc
isn't
interested
in
relieving
applicants
from
any
obligation
to
go
forward
with
procedures
that
may
surface,
problems
that
it
should
be
aware
of.
mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
i
won't
say
full
compliance;
people
go
through
the
process.
the
reported
decisions
indicate
that
when
conflicts
have
arisen
the
courts
have
resolved
those
conflicts
in
favor
of
the...
in
the
manner
of
first
iowa
and
in
favor
of
federal
authority
where
there's
been
an
actual
conflict.
i
believe
there
have
been
few
conflicts
because
people
understand
the
way
the
system
works
and...
and
problems
are
adjusted
in
accordance
with
the
existing
scheme.
i'm
not
aware
of
a
lot
of
situations
in
which
there's
insistence
that
hardens
into
a
dispute
that
needs
to
be
resolved
judicially.
we
disagree
with
the
california's
suggestion
that
absence
of
conflict
reflects
a
general
acceptance
of
the
idea
that
compliance
with
state
law
is
necessary.
we
think
it
reflects
a
general
understanding
about
the
way
the
system
has
worked
since
first
iowa.
because
my
opponent's
principal
point
is
based
on
california
v.
united
states
i
think
it's
important
for
me
to
address
that
now.
i
think
what
is
clear
from
the
argument
here,
if
it
wasn't
before,
is
that
no
one
is
arguing
for
literal
compliance
with
section
27.
no
one
is
arguing
that
if
a...
if
an
argument
can
be
made
that
a
state
law
relates
to
the
use
of
water
for
any
use,
it's
automatically
enforceable
without
respect
to
any
other
provision
of
federal
or...
federal
law.
the
question
is
how
can
we
attempt
to
give
effect
to
that
provision
and
also
effect
to
what...
to
the
substance
of
what
congress
was
evidently
attempting
to
achieve
in
the
federal
power
act.
we
submit
that
the
first
iowa
accommodation,
an
accommodation
that
respects
the
affirmative
licensing
judgment
conferred
on
the
commission
and
also
describes
that
category
of
state
law
that
is
saved
as
an
entirely
plausible
and
entirely
reasonable
provision
that
has
worked
for
some
time
and
doesn't
deserve
to
be
reconsidered.
but
even
under
the
framework
of
california,
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled
to
win
this
case.
under
california,
one
looks
to
identify
a
clear
congressional
directive
and
then
recognizes
that
section...
that
a
savings
clause
will
not
be
deemed
to
supersede
it.
now,
there's
nothing
in
california
that
suggests
that
a
clear
congressional
directive
must
take
a
prescriptive,
clear
form
such
as
no
more
than
160
acres,
which
was
the
issue
in
the
ivanhoe
case.
we
believe
that
congress
can
express
an
intention
to
delegate
affirmative
responsibility
to
a
federal
agency
to
make
a
particular
judgment
call
and
that
when
it
has
made
that
judgment
call
it's
entitled
to
the
same
respect
as
a
congressional
action
itself.
let
me
suggest
a...
an
example
that
may
clarify
the
point.
in
the
fresno
case
the
court
noted
that
the
savings
clause
would
not
save
state
law,
which
granted
a
priority
to
municipal
uses
of
water.
the
court
noted
that
the
reclamation
act
required
the
secretary
to
provide...
to
favor
irrigation
and
to
provide
water
for
municipal
use
only
when
he
first
determined
that
it
would
not
undercut
the
use
of
a
project
for
irrigation
purposes.
let's
suppose
that
instead
that
statute
had
said
that
the
secretary
shall
have
authority
to
provide
water
which
in
his
judgment
is
best
adapted...
to
those
uses
that
in
his
judgment
would
best
adapt
the
project
to
a
comprehensive
plan
for
the
distribution
of
water
for
irrigation,
power,
navigation,
interstate
commerce
and
other
beneficial
uses.
we
submit
that
that
affirmative
grant
of
authority
would
qualify
as
a
express
congressional
directive,
a
clear
congressional
directive.
it's
clear
why
congress
had
to
proceed
by
that
means
in
the
federal
power
act.
it
couldn't
personally
supervise
the
hundreds
of
hydropower
projects
in
various
situations
that
would
be
necessary
across
the
united
states.
it
had
to
act
by
means
of
a
broad
delegation
to
someone
else
to
study
the
details
and
to
make
a
judgment
call
about
whether
they
were
the
appropriate
ones.
mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
our
first
position
is
that
first
iowa
should
be
enforced
according
to
its
terms.
but
our
second
position
is
that
the
express
delegation
of
authority
to
the
commission
is
the
kind
of
clear
congressional
directive,
when
exercised,
that
is
exempted
from
the
savings
clause.
mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
no.
and
let
me
emphasize
three
things
about
the
delegation
that
we
believe
underscore
the
importance
of
respecting
congress'
choice
of
that
term.
first
of
all,
it's
an
affirmative
delegation.
congress
in
this
case
has
not
given
the
commission
the
job
of
certifying
compliance
with
certain
minimum
standards.
its
job
under
section
10(a)
of
the
act
is
to
determine
whether
the
project
is
best
adapted
to
a
variety
of
interests.
and
that's
a...
a...
it's
supposed
to
make
an
affirmative
judgment,
and
we
think
that
that
phrasing
suggests
that
it
must
have
meant
that
when
the
commission
determined
what
was
best,
that
would
be
put
into
effect.
secondly,
the
matters
committed
to
the
commission's
judgment
are
comprehensive.
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
the
udall
case,
it's
supposed
to
consider
all
interests
relevant
to
the
public
interest.
the
strong
suggestion
is
that
there
is...
that
what...
when
it's
done
that
properly,
disputes
with
state
authority
will
take
the
form
of
differing
judgments
about
matters
that
have
been
committed
to
the
commission's
judgment.
and
we
believe
that,
again,
there's
another...
that's
another
very
strong
indication
that
congress
must
have
meant
its
judgments
to
be
implemented...
the
commission's
judgments
to
be
implemented.
finally,
the
commission's
judgment
encompasses
matters
of
national
and
regional
scope,
matters
that
may
not
be
fully
reflected
in
state
law,
in
particular
interstate
and
foreign
commerce
and
navigability
and,
in
the
background,
the
nation's
need
for
renewable
resources
of
energy
as
opposed
to
coal
and
oil-fired
plants.
again,
those
three
characteristics
of
the
delegation
to
the
commission...
its
affirmative
nature,
its
comprehensive
nature
and
its
national
nature...
are
very
strong
indication
that
congress
meant
for
what
the
commission
judged
to
be
best
would
be
put
into
effect.
and
in
considering
that
i
think
that
it's
important
as
well
to
remember
that
while
this
particular
project
involves
a
relatively
small
stream
in
california,
that
the
act
as
a
whole
applies
nationwide
to
projects
of
a
much
greater
scope.
we've
cited
in
our
brief
the
allegheny
power
case,
in
which
the
commission
considered
an
application...
considered
applications
for
19
licenses
in
the
upper
ohio
river
basin
simultaneously
and
granted
16
of
them.
those...
those
projects
were
in
two
states.
the
ohio
river
is
obviously
a
state
that
is...
it
crosses
state
boundaries
and
in
which--
mr.
sternen
l.
nightingale
--i'm
sorry.
the
ohio
river
crosses
several
state
lines
and
presents
serious
interstate
issues.
so,
i...
i...
when...
when
construing
the
statute,
trying
to
determine
the
relationship
within
the
overall
scheme
of
the
commission's
licensing
authority
and
section
27,
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
accommodation
will
apply
across
the
board,
not
just
to
relatively
small
projects.
the
suggestion
that
it
is
available
to
the
court
to
disavow
the
dictum
in
first
iowa
i
think
understates
the
nature
of
the
change
in
law
that
would
be
necessary
to
adopt
california's
position
in
this
case.
as
i've
indicated,
i
believe
that
the
federal
power
commission
v.
oregon
case
cannot
stand
along
with
a
decision
that
every
federal
hydropower
project
is
required
to
obtain
a
federal
license
on
the
terms
that
a
state
may
choose
to
give
it.
that
was
a
case
in
which
an
applicant
failed
to
get
a
state
license
and
the
court
nevertheless
held
that
the
project
could
go
forward.
finally,
i'd
like
to
follow
through
on
the
point
that
justice
o'connor
raised
about
the
status
quo.
i
think
there
is
a...
there
would
be
a
significant...
that
a
decision
in
effect
overruling
first
iowa
subordinating
federal
hydropower
projects
to
all
state
water
law
would
have
a
significant
impact
in
three
significant
respects.
first,
in
1986
congress
passed
a
statute,
the
environmental
consumer...
i
mean
electrical
consumers
protection
act,
which
reinforced
the
commission's
responsibility
to
consider
and
address
environmental
issues
in
its
licenses.
under
that
statute,
the
congress
created
procedures
whereby
concerns
about
the
environment
would
be
funneled
through
the
licensing
process.
the
commission
is
required
to
solicit
recommendations
from
state
and
federal
agencies
with
wildlife
concerns.
it's
also
required
to
consider
state
plans
for
comprehensive
development
in
its
licensing
decisions.
the
very
clear
implication
of
that
legislation
is
that
the
commission
was
to
have
the
final
say,
with
the
benefit
of
the
views
of
the
states.
a
decision
that
the
states
could
implement
their
own
policy
choices
through
state
water
law
would
seriously
undercut
that
scheme,
we
submit.
secondly,
there's
nothing
in
california's
argument
that
would
limit
its
interpretation
to
those
state
water
laws
that
apply
at
the
threshold
of
a
hydroelectric
project.
there
are
a
number
of
projects
in
operation
right
now
that
have
been
licensed,
we
believe,
on
the
assumption
that
first
iowa
was
good
law.
california,
among
other
states,
have
begun
to
revise
state
water
law
to
permit
changes
in
water
appropriations
after
an
initial
license
or
permission
to
use
water
has
been
granted
under
the
public
trust
doctrine.
we
believe
that
there
would
be
considerable
uncertainty
engendered
if
california's
view
were
adopted
and
that
body
of
state
law
were
potentially
applicable
to
licensed
existing
projects.
finally,
projects
are
relicensed
on
a
regular
basis.
licenses
are
issued
for
terms
of
up
to
50
years
but
a
number
of
major
projects
come
up
for
renewal
on
a
regular
basis,
and
we
believe
that
the
result
for
which
california
argues
in
this
case
could
have
a
serious
unsettling
effect
on
those
procedures
as
well.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
