justice
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question?
how
do
you...
how
do
you
explain
the
sudden
interest
of
49
sister
states
and
california
asking
us
to
make
a
change
in
the
law
if
they
haven't
made
any
request
to
congress?
or
you're
saying
this
isn't
really
a
change
in
the
law
at
all?
justice
stevens
but
wouldn't
you
have
done
the
same
thing
if
california
v.
united
states
had
never
been
decided?
how
does
that
fit
into
the
picture?
justice
stevens
didn't
that
suggest
to
you--
justice
stevens
--an
argument
that
none
of
these
49
states
had
thought--
justice
stevens
--has
thought
of
it
for
several
years?
justice
stevens
xxx.
justice
stevens
i
thought
it
was
your...
your
submission
that
california
had
in
effect
changed
the...
the
law
and
now
everybody
was
getting
on
the
bandwagon
to
make
sure
we
take
advantage
of
this
change.
justice
stevens
with
a
different
statute.
justice
stevens
but
not
strong
enough
to
go
to
congress
on...
on
the
point?
justice
stevens
but
this
is
the
first
place
you
go
to
get
a
change
in
the
law,
in
other
words?
[laughter]
justice
stevens
and
contrary
to
the
way
the
court
interpreted
whether
it's
dictum
or
not
in
a
case
of
about
40
years
ago.
justice
stevens
in
a
different
statute.
it
didn't
even
cite
the
first
iowa
case.
justice
stevens
but
he's
quite
about
that
because
there
are
differences
between
the
cases.
they're
different
statutes,
among
other
things.
justice
stevens
is
there
a
counterpart
to
section
in
the
other
statute?
justice
stevens
why
don't
you
go
ahead?
