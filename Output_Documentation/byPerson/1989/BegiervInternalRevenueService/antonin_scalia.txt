justice
scalia
you're...
you're
not
now
saying
that
it
has
to
be
segregated.
you're
just
saying
that
it
has
to
exist,
that
when
somebody
pays
an
employee
$80
and
fails
to
withhold
the
$10
or
put
that
aside
for
the
government,
there...
there
is
no
$10
to...
for
the
trust
to
attach
to.
justice
scalia
now,
that
would
be
different
for
a
sales
tax,
i
suppose.
if
you
collect
a
sales
tax
and
it's
provided
that
the
sales
tax
shall
be
held
in
trust,
you
would
actually
get
the
sales
tax
and
that
could
be
held
in
trust.
justice
scalia
but
with
the
withholding
of...
of
wages
there's--
justice
scalia
--there's
nothing
to
identify.
justice
scalia
you
just
paid
him...
paid
him
80.
you
were
supposed
to
put
10
aside,
but
there
is
no
10
that
we
know
of
that's
an
identifiable
10.
well,
obviously
there
was
money
though,
because
they
paid
him.
justice
scalia
mr....
mr.
winterhalter,
it...
it
seems
to
me...
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
why
you
say...
why
you
say
that
there
has
to
be
a
res
in
order
for
a
trust
to
be
created.
but
if
the
statute,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out...
if
it
says
it
shall
be
created,
the
federal
government
can
make
it
happen.
i
should
think
that...
that
the
problem
here
is
not
whether
it's
created,
but
how
you
identify
it,
that
when
the
government
says
in
this
statute
that
it
will
be
a
special
fund
in
trust,
you
don't
know
what
the
res
is.
you
don't
know
whether
it's
the
bank
accounts
or
the
corporate...
the
corporation's
real
property
or
any
of
the
other
assets
of
the
corporation.
and,
therefore,
when
it
comes
to...
to
identifying
something
that...
that
is
subject
to
this
special
privilege,
you
can't
identify
it.
it
isn't
that
it
couldn't
be
created,
it's
that
it's
not
identifiable
later.
isn't
that
your...
your
point?
justice
scalia
it
could
be
created
in
the
abstract,
but
you
can't
give
it
effect
in
the
abstract.
unless
you
can
identify
a
res,
you
can't
identify
the
trust
corpus.
justice
scalia
--i'm
sure
you
do.
[laughter]
mr.
winterhalter,
it's...
it's
my
understanding
of
trust
law
that
if
you
declare
yourself
to
be
a
trustee
of
a
res
which
is
not
in
existence
at
the
time,
but
later
declare
the
res,
it
is
effective.
that
is,
if
i
tell
my
nephew
i
am
putting
in
trust
$500
for
you
and
in
fact
i
don't,
but
several
weeks
later
i
set
aside
the
$500
and
i
say
this
is
the...
this
is
the
trust
corpus
for
my
nephew,
that's
effective.
so,
you
can
do
it
later.
right?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
right.
but
i
can
do
it
later.
justice
scalia
i
don't
have
to
do
it
at
the
moment
that
it's
created.
justice
scalia
now
why
isn't
it...
and
it's
also
hornbook
trust
law,
as
i
understand
it,
that
you
can
declare
in
trust
a
portion
of
a
fungible
account.
so
you
can
say
$500
of
this
bank
account
is
held
in
trust
for
my
nephew.
justice
scalia
okay.
now,
when
you
put
those
principles...
two
principles
together,
why
is
it
not
the
case
that
as
soon
as
the
corporation
wrote
out
this
check
to
the
united
states
it
identified
a
portion
of
that
bank
account
as
being
the
trust
corpus
that
was
owed
to
the
government
before
it
was
transmitted
to
the
government.
justice
scalia
i'm
not
using
it
as
check.
i'm
not
using
it
for
its
conveyance
purposes.
i'm
using
it
for
its
declaration
of
what
is
the
corpus
of
the
trust.
as
soon
as
you
sign
that
check
you
have
effectively
expressed
your
intention
that
this
is
indeed
the
portion
that
belongs
to
the
united
states.
justice
scalia
as
opposed
to
my
real
estate.
i
agree
with
you,
before
that
we
have
no
idea
what
portion
of
the
corporation's
assets
belong
to
the
united
states.
we
don't
know
that
it
was
a
real
estate
or
whatever
and
i'm
sure
the
government
would
use
whatever...
whatever
was
convenient
at
the
time.
but
once
the...
once
the
corporation
signs
that
check,
the
corporation
has
acknowledged
a
particular
corpus.
justice
scalia
there
is
no...
there's
no...
how
do
you
identify...
look
the
statute
applies
not
only
to...
to
funds
collected
but
also
to
funds
withheld.
there
is
no
identifiable
dollar
withheld.
when
i
pay
you
$80
and
withhold
$10
for
federal
income
tax,
what
identifiable
dollar
is
that?
it's
no
identifiable
dollar.
it
is
money
i
have
not
paid
you.
justice
scalia
so,
you
have
to
rely
on
my
declaration
of
a
fund
later,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
scalia
that's
for
a
sales
tax.
yes.
when
i
get
the
tax,
you
say
that's
it,
that's
what
the
trust
attached
to.
but
not
for
a
withholding
tax.
the
withholding
tax
never
exists.
there...
there
is
no
dollar
it...
it
ever
attaches
to.
it's
just
money
i
do
not
pay
you.
justice
scalia
or
withheld.
justice
scalia
there
doesn't
have
to
be
a
connection.
justice
scalia
the
res
was
created
later.
but
you
acknowledge
that
you
can
put
it
into
a
special
account
and
that
that
creates
a
trust
without
a
preference.
and
i
just
don't
see
how
that
follows
from
your
argument.
justice
scalia
well,
withhold
means
simply
not
paid.
justice
scalia
well,
okay.
that
doesn't
suggest
the
existence
that
they've
put
a
deposit
of
monies--
justice
scalia
you
just
mean
not
paid.
justice
scalia
all
right.
so,
the
trust
consists...
the
trust
res
consists
of
a
liability?
[laughter]
that's
what
you've
said.
justice
scalia
mr.
martin,
i'm...
i'm
willing
to
concede
that
you
can
create
a
trust
by
law.
you
can
just
say
by
law
there
is
a
trust.
justice
scalia
but
you...
you
know,
you
can't
make
black
white
by
law.
you
can't
pass
a
law
that
makes
black
white.
and
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
to
enforce
a
trust
and...
and...
and
that
is
an
objective
reality.
you
are
trying
to
move
on
some
corpus.
justice
scalia
and
you
can't
decree
the
existence
of
a
corpus
by
law.
justice
scalia
so,
we...
we...
we
have
to
find
some
corpus
to
identify
for
the
legal
consequences
that
you
want
to
attach.
justice
scalia
now,
at...
until
the
check
was
written
at
least,
that
corpus
could
have
been
anything.
it
could
have
been
the
company's
plant.
it
could
have
been
any
asset
whatever
of
the
company.
i
wouldn't
know
how
to
apply
a
trust
law
theory
to
that
kind
of
a
situation.
justice
scalia
but
you...
you
would
apply
it
even
before
the
check
was
written.
you...
you
would
say
that
somehow
you
would
have
a
preference
on
the
corporation's
assets
even
before
there
was
any
identification.
justice
scalia
wow,
boy,
that--
--we
don't
have
to
decide
that
in
this
case.
justice
scalia
i...
i
assume
that
what
you
assert
the
federal
government
can
do
by
using
the
device
of
trust
law,
you
are
willing
to
acknowledge
that
state
governments
can
do
as
well.
justice
scalia
so,
a
state
government
could
say,
henceforward,
any
taxes
owed
to
the
state
shall
be
a
trust
and
they
would...
they...
they
would
acquire
a
preference
under
bankruptcy
law.
you
think
about
that
for
a
minute.
justice
scalia
what
other
purpose
is
7501
used
for?
i
mean,
it...
it
seems
to
me
it
might
be
possible
to
read
the
first
sentence
of
7501(a)
as...
as
its
whole
purpose
is
simply
to...
to
lay
the
basis
for
the
second
sentence.
that
is,
the...
the
only
reality
that
this
fund
has
in
the
world
is
to
enable
the
assessment,
collection
and
payment
in
the
same
manner
as
the
taxes
out
of
which
it
arose.
