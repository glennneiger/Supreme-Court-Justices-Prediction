justice
kennedy
well,
suppose
what
the
company
did
in
this
case
with
respect
to
monies
that
was
paid
from
the
general
account,
drew
one
check
to
the
general
account
and
then
immediately...
pardon
me...
drew
one
check
from
the
general
check
to
the
special
account--
justice
kennedy
--then
a
second
check
special
account
to
the
government.
does
that
create
the
trust?
justice
kennedy
and...
and
you
couldn't
set
it
aside
as
a
preference
that
putting
it
in
the
trust
was
a
preference?
i
mean,
how
would
that
would
be
any
different
from
the
argument
you're
making
now?
justice
kennedy
but
it's
not...
it's
not
a
preference
to
create
a
trust
res?
justice
kennedy
but
it...
but
it...
but
it
is...
but
it
is
a
preference
to
directly
to
pay
the
irs?
justice
kennedy
that...
that
doesn't
make
sense.
justice
kennedy
but...
but
why
isn't
the
payment
to
the
government
the
designation?
justice
kennedy
why...
why
is
doing
something
directly
less
of
a
designation
than
doing
it
indirectly?
justice
kennedy
mr.
martin,
in...
in
the
case
of
the
special
fund
that
is
created
that
is
a
separate
earmarked
bank
account,
if
the
employer
coming
upon
hard
times
decides
to
change
his
mind
or
its
mind
and
takes
the
money
back,
is...
is
there
some
kind
of
criminal
liability?
justice
kennedy
and...
but
that...
but
that
special
liability,
that
special
criminal
liability
doesn't
apply
if
there
is
simply
a
failure
to
earmark
funds
that
are
in
the
general
account
and
those
funds
would
then
disappear
or
what?
justice
kennedy
if
it's
a
trust
in
either
event--
justice
kennedy
--but...
but
is
the
gravamen
of
the
offense
the
invasion
of
an
identified
trust
corpus?
justice
kennedy
in
other
words,
it's
just
failure
to
withhold?
