justice
stevens
but
when
must
it
be
created?
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
position
on
that.
supposing
30
days
before
bankruptcy
they
have
$1,000
payroll
and
$200
withholding
obligation.
they
have
$1,200
in
the
bank
and
they
pay
$1,000
to
the...
to
the
employees
and
don't
do
anything
to
with
the
two
hundred
until
after
the
bankruptcy.
or
they
pay
the
200.
would
that
be...
would
that
be
a
preference?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
yeah,
a
week
later,
but
still
within
the
preference
period.
justice
stevens
other
than
the
fact
that
they
did
use
the
money
to
pay
the
government?
that's
not
enough,
of
course.
justice
stevens
well,
what
do
they...
they
have
to
put
it...
you're...
they
have
to
put
in
a
separate
account
before
the...
in...
in...
before
the
preference
period
begins.
justice
stevens
only
as
to
the
extent
of
trust
funds,
though.
it
wouldn't
be
as
to
all
tax
obligations...
corporate...
income
tax,
for
example.
justice
stevens
--set
aside?
justice
stevens
i
know,
but
when
you
have
a...
when
you
file
a
form
that
says
gross
wages
x--
justice
stevens
--and
net
wages
x
minus
the
tax,
that
isn't
proof
that
the
amount
withheld
was
actually
withheld.
it's
just
a
proof
they
filed
a
piece
of
paper
that
said
they
were
doing
it.
justice
stevens
it's
genuine.
justice
stevens
i
still
don't...
maybe
i'm
stupid.
say,
they
have
enough
money
to
pay
net
wages
and
they
file
a
return
that
says
we
withheld
the
difference
between
net
wages
and
gross
wages.
would
that
be...
but
they
actually
didn't
have
any
money.
they
have...
it's
a
no-asset
business.
it's
a
sales
operation
of
some
kind,
and
all
the
money
they
had
in...
available
to
them
they
used
to
pay
net
wages,
but
they
filed
the
return
suggesting
that
we
withheld
this
amount
and
we
recognize
an
obligation
to
pay
it
when
we
get
the
money.
justice
stevens
what
has
been
withheld?
justice
stevens
but
there
is
no
asset
representing
the
amount
withheld?
