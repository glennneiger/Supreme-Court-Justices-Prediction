justice
o'connor
well,
it
doesn't
really
say
that,
does
it?
it
says,
the
amount
of
tax
so
collected
or
withheld
shall
be
held
to
be
a
special
fund
in
trust.
justice
o'connor
it...
it
provides
automatically
by
statute
that
whatever
amount
is
withheld
for
these
taxes
is
automatically
in
trust
for
the
government.
isn't
that
what
it
says?
justice
o'connor
so
why
does
it
have
to
be
segregated
to
comply
with
the
statute?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
congress
set
up
a
scheme
whereby
avoidance
could
be
had
for
items
that
were
property
of
the
debtor.
these
monies
weren't
property
of
the
debtor.
they
were
the
property
of
the
united
states
the
minute
they
are
withheld.
it
doesn't
belong
to
the
debtor
anymore.
justice
o'connor
well,
that's
the
statutory
scheme.
justice
o'connor
well,
there
is
no
tracing
problem
here.
once
the
check
is
drawn,
that
solves
that.
they've
set
it
aside.
