h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
on
no.
89-393,
harry
p.
begier
v.
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
winterhalter.
chief
justice
rehnquist
all
the
payments
you've
described,
mr.
winterhalter,
were
within
the
preferential
period?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
particular
funds
was
the
court
of
appeals
talking
about?
chief
justice
rehnquist
simply
money
drawn
on
its
general
operating
account?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
winterhalter,
let's
go
back
to
that
second
clause
of
7501
that
justice
o'connor
referred
to.
the
amount
of
tax
so
collected
or
withheld
shall
be
held
to
be
a
special
fund
in
trust
for
the
united
states.
now,
certainly
congress
can
legislate
in
a
way
that
says
a...
a
particular
fund
shall
be
treated
in
a
particular
way
even
though
under
the
classic
law
of
trusts
there
might
not
be
any
res,
can't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you...
don't
you
think
that's...
might
be
what
it
intended
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
statute...
this
clause
we've
been
talking
about...
said
any
paid
amount
of
tax
so
collected
or
withheld
shall
become
the
property
of
the
united
states?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
this
statute
would
not
have...
the
statute
i'm
talking
about
says
nothing
about
a
trust.
it
simply
says
the
money
that
was
withheld
shall
become
the
property
of
the
united
states.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i...
i
have
the
feeling
that
the
statute
congress
did
enact
is
not
far
different
from--
chief
justice
rehnquist
xxx
the
problem?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
he
withholds
by
the
act
of
paying
the
employee
only
the
net,
i
would
think.
withhold
means
deduct.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
he
is
with...
if
i...
if
i
hire
you
for
$100
a
week
and
your
gross
is
$100
and
your
net
is
$80,
when
i
pay
you
$80,
i
have
by
definition
withheld
$20,
even
though
i
don't
have
the
$20.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
if
you're
looking
for
something
that
meets
all
the
requirements
of
bogurt
on
trusts,
i
agree
that
it
can't.
i...
my
view
is
that
this
statute
does
not
require
those.
it
cannot
attach
immediately,
but
i
thought
you
conceded
before
that...
that
the
res
does
not
have
to
be
in
existence
at
the
time.
you
can
establish
the
res
later.
and
why
didn't
that
happen
when
the
check
was
written,
even
using
bogurt?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
is
the
bankruptcy
code
you're
referring
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
congress
could
have
rejected
that
because
it
would
have
extended
to
state
and
local
government
units,
too,
the
way
you
have
expressed
it,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--just
that
they
did
not
paid
that
amount.
chief
justice
rehnquist
oh,
i
see.
chief
justice
rehnquist
xxx.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're...
you're
not
suggesting
that
in
the
strict
sense
of
trust
law,
the
filing
of
a
withholding...
a
return
showing
tax
withheld
creates
any
sort
of
a
res,
are
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
was
no
withholding
in
1934.
that
must
have
been
added
later,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
martin.
mr.
winterhalter,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
winterhalter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
