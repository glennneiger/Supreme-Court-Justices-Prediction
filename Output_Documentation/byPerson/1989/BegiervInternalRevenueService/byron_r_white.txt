justice
white
well,
what
about
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
white
well,
you
had
better
start
with
that,
hadn't
you?
[laughter]
justice
white
well,
what
does
it...
doesn't
the...
doesn't
the
law
say
that
these
withheld
taxes
are
to
be
held
as
a
trust
fund?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
well,
whatever
the
law
says...
that...
that
amount
is
going
be
held
in
trust,
and
the
money
was
there
to
be
held
in
trust.
justice
white
well,
it
was
paid.
justice
white
well,
on
that
basis
it
wouldn't
do
you
any
good
to
segregate
these
funds
that
you've
withheld.
justice
white
well,
i
thought
you
said
a
while
ago
if
you
actually
segregated
these
withheld
funds,
they
would
not
become
property
of
the
estate.
justice
white
and
there
could
be
no
avoidance.
justice
white
well,
but
the
argument
you've
just
made
from
that
other
provision
of
the
law
on
the
preference
i
would
think
it
would...
i
would
think
that
would
cover
the
withheld
funds
that
are
segregated
also.
justice
white
very
well,
mr.
winterhalter.
mr.
martin.
justice
white
may
i...
may
i
interrupt
you
right
there?
justice
white
those
forms
proved
that
that's
the
amount
that
should
have
been--
justice
white
but
where
were
they
withheld?
were
they...
could
you...
were
they
actually...
there
were
actually
funds
there
that
were
placed
in
a
bank
account?
