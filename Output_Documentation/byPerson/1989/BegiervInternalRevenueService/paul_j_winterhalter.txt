mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
good
afternoon.
the
third
case
before
the
court
today
involves
whether
a
debtor's
pre-bankruptcy
payment
alone
from
its
general
operating
account
for
trust
fund
tax
obligations
excludes
that
property
from
a
bankruptcy
estate
subject
to
avoidance
as
preferential
transfers
under
section
547.
for
the
reasons
which
i
shall
present
to
this
court,
i
would
respectfully
present
that
such
transfers
are,
in
fact,
avoidable.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
the
court-appointed
chapter
11
bankruptcy
trustee
in
the
matter
of
american
international
airways.
the
debtor
was
a
commercial
airline
carrier
that
provided
scheduled
passenger
and
air
cargo
service
throughout
the
eastern
and
central
united
states.
as
a
carrier,
the
debtor
had
many
employees
and
was
required
to
pay
wages
to
those
employees
and
was
further
required
to
withhold
taxes
from
those
employees'
wages,
was
required
to
withhold
individual
income
taxes,
the
employer's...
the
employee's
share
of
federal
insurance
corporation
taxes,
and
was
further
required
to
retain
certain
excise
taxes
which
it
collected
from
the
passengers'
tickets.
by
the
first
quarter
of
1984,
the
debtor
had
become...
had
experienced
financial
difficulties
in
the
payments
of
its...
of
its
debt...
of
its
debts.
similar
to
many
companies
in
this
type
of
situation,
the
debtor
failed
to
file
and
pay
its
tax
returns
on
a
timely
basis.
the
debtor
funded
only
net
payroll.
the
irs
imposed
extraordinary
remedies
for
the
enforcement
of
the
collect...
for
the
enforcement
of
these
taxes.
it
issued
a
notice
changing
the
debtor's
tax
filing
requirements
from
a
quarterly
basis
to
a
monthly
basis.
it
also
required
the
debtor
to
make
deposits
into
a
certain
designated
depository.
the
debtor
followed
these
guidelines
and
on
april
30th
transferred
two
checks
to
the
government,
one
out
of
the
specially
designated
account
and
the
second
check
in
the
amount
of
$734,797
from
the
debtor's
general
operating
account.
the
debtor
and
the
irs
agreed
to
specific
application
of
these
funds.
two
further
payments
were
made
out
of
the
general
operating
account
just
prior
to
the
bankruptcy.
one
for
$200,000,
which
was
applied
to
941
withholding
taxes
and
the
second
in
the
amount
of
$11,636
which
was
applied
to
federal
unemployment
taxes
and
also
to
form
11
taxes
for
the
year
1982.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
debtor's
financial
difficulties
continued,
whereby
on
july
19th,
1984,
the
debtor
filed
its
petition
under
chapter
11.
problems
persisted
and
a
trustee
was
appointed
two
months
later.
during
the
administration
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
the
trustee
instituted
this
instant
action,
seeking
to
avoid
the
three
transfers
made
out
of
the
debtor's
general
operating
account.
following
a
trial,
the
bankruptcy
court
ruled
that
the
trustee
was
entitled
to
avoid
$700,410.
the
district
court
affirmed.
on
subsequent
appeal
to
the
third
circuit,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
reversed
the
bankruptcy
court
and
district
court
findings.
the
third
circuit,
relying
principally
on
the
dissenting
opinion
of
the
d.c.
circuit
in
drabkin
v.
the
district
of
columbia,
found
the
ability
of
the
debtor
to
make
the
pre-petition
payment
of
withholding
taxes
regardless
of
the
source
of
those
funds
impressed
those
funds
with
trust
characteristics,
removing
the
property
from
the
debtor's
estate.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
your
honor,
i'm
not
certain
i
understand
your
question.
the
funds...
the
funds
which
the
court
of
appeals
was
discussing
were
the
funds
that
the
debtor
used
to
pay
the
internal
revenue
service.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
that
is
correct.
they
were
written
on
a
regular
check
that
the...
that
the
debtor
would
pay
any
other
creditor.
it
is
respectfully
presented
that
the
holding
of
the
third
circuit
is
incorrect
and
should
be
reversed.
the
circuit's
reasoning
is
wrong
on
four
specific
points.
first,
the
court
relies
on
the
wrong
legislative
history
to
support
its
contention
that
congress
intended
to
preclude
the
avoidability
of
tax
withholding
payments.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
my
second
point
would
be
that
the
clear
language
of
the
statute--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--i
would
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
clear
language...
the
plain
wording
of
the
statute
expressly
requires
that
for
this
trust
to
be
created
the
taxes
must
be
withheld
or
collected.
in
this
situation,
we
did
not
have
that
situation.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
yes,
it
does.
section
7501
of
the
internal
revenue
code--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--provides
that--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--justice
white,
provides
that
any
taxes
which
are
collected
and
withheld
shall
be
held
in
trust.
the
wording
of
the
statute...
the
plain
wording
of
the
statute
expressly
indicates
that
the...
expressly
indicates
and
is
written
in
the
past
tense
that
the
funds
must
be
collected
and
withheld.
there
must
be
some
type
of
segregation.
this
segregation
does
not--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--that--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--the
statute
says
expressly
that,
justice
o'connor.
i
would
represent--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--i
would
represent
to
the
court,
as
has
this
court
on
other
occasions,
that
there
must
be
a
trust
raised
for
a
trust
to
be
established.
there
must
be
something
there.
if...
here
the
government
suggests
that
they
need
do
nothing,
that
payment
alone
is
a
sufficient
designation
to
establish
this
trust.
but
there
is
no
trust
existence.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
the
property
is--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
yes,
there
is
money.
but
there
is
no--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--not
necessarily
so.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
yes,
it
was
paid.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
yes,
it
can.
but--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--no,
i
do
not
believe
it
did.
i
believe
the...
when
congress
enacted
section
7501,
which
was
back
in
1934,
it
had
contemplated
providing
some
protections
for
the
government
in
the
collection
of
their
taxes.
they
have
provided
other
statutes
which
expressly
empower
the
government
to
enforce
its
collection
efforts.
section
6672
would
be
an
example.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
absolutely.
i
think
there
is
the
act
of
the
segregation
itself.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
well,
i
think
in
the
situation
which
you
have
raised
in
your
hypothetical,
there
is
the...
there
is
the
designation.
there
is
the
creation
of
the
trust
res
which
allows
it
to
come
into
existence.
there
is
oftentimes
suggested
that
the
normal
business
operates
properly--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--no,
i
do
not--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--let
me
correct
that
statement.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
i
believe
that
it
would
be
a
preference
to
create
a
trust
res
for
any
party.
but
i
believe
under
section
7501
congress
had
enacted
a
provision
which
gives
the
irs
special
treatment
under
certain
circumstances.
and
that
is
when
the
trust
money
is
properly
withheld.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
my
point
is,
justice
scalia,
that
there
must
be
some
act,
some
separation.
it
does
not
have
to
be
the
deposit
into
the
designated
account.
it
does
not
have
to
be
the
deposit
into
the
approved
tax
depository
in
the
normal
business
sense.
but
there
must
be
something.
the...
for
the,
for
the
trust
to
be
created,
there
must
be
something
to
set
aside.
it
can't
just...
it's
not
an
abstract,
as
the
government
suggested
in
their
brief.
there
must
be
the
creation
that
the--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--i
don't
believe
i
disagree
with
that.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
if
they
held
the
200
in
their
general
operating
account?
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
and
then
paid
it
directly
to
the
government?
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
presuming
that
the
other
elements
of
a
preference
have
been
satisfied,
i
would
believe
that
that...
i
would
believe
that
that
would
be
a
preference.
i
believe
that's
the
situation
here.
we
have
funds
being
used
which
were
in
the
account,
but
no
connection
being
made
between
the
$200
in
your
hypothetical
and
the
$700,000
in
this
hypothetical
which
would
connect
the
monies
collected
with
the
trust
being
created.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
that
is...
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
i'm...
i'm
not
saying
to
create
the
segregation
itself
or
to
create
the
designation
it
has
to
be
placed
in
a
separate
account.
again,
many
businesses
operate
under
a
three
bank
account
system.
they
have
their
general
operating
account
which
they
collect
their
revenues.
they
then
have
their
payroll
account
and
they
have
their
tax
account.
they
would
collect
revenues
from
the
normal
operation
of
their
business,
place
them
in
their...
place
them...
place
those
monies
into
their
general
operating
account.
use
the
general
operating
account
to
pay
their
normal
expenses,
which
would
include
their
payroll
and
their
wages.
and
once
they
provide
gross
wages
into
the
payroll
account,
they
then,
in
turn,
would
transmit
the
requisite
funds
to
satisfy
the
withholding
tax
obligations.
upon
doing
that,
i
think
the
7501
would
come
into
effect.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
i...
i
still
don't
believe
you
have
reached
that
threshold
of
identifying
the
trust
res.
there
is...
the
statute
does
not
say--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--if
there
has
been
no
withholding,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
trust...
well,
you're...
instead
of
putting
the
property
in
trust,
you're
creating
a
statute
which
would
in
effect
transfer
title
to
the
property
directly
to
the
government--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--upon
the
operation
of
the
statute.
i'm
not
certain
how
that
would
work,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
believe
that
if...
if
congress
specifically
enacted
that
statute
and
expressly
stated
such
in
a
statute,
then,
in
fact,
that
would
be
controlling.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
i
believe
that
hornbook
trust
law
would...
would
look
to
the
intent
to
the
trustee
in
that
situation.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
yes.
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
yes,
you
can.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
you
would
be
talking...
i...
my...
my
response
to
that
would
be
it
would
not
be
a
trust
because
you
would
be
transferring
title
to
the
funds
to
the
government
on
that
time.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
what
in
effect
as--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--mr.
justice
scalia,
i
would
present
to
you
that
the
trust
which
is
required
to
be
created
in
order
for
7501
to
be
attached...
to
attach,
this
trust
to
be
created,
must
relate
to
the
funds
collected
from
employees'
wages.
if
these
funds
are
dissipated...
if
the
bank
account
goes
down
to
zero,
then
you
cannot
take
funds
unrelated
to
the
employees'
wages
and
recreate
them
in
a
trust.
those
funds
will
never
be
affected
with
the
trust
characteristics
if
in
fact
they
came
from
funds
which
were
not
generated
from
employees'
wages.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
but
this
is--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--i
would
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
the
trust
language,
mr.
justice
scalia,
under
7501
does
not
suggest
that
the
trust
attaches
to
monies
collected
and
which
should
have
been
collected.
it
only
says
that
the
trust
attaches
to
monies
which
were
collected.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--or
withheld.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
but
if
we
fund
only
net
payroll,
if
the
employer
pays
only
net
payroll
while
the...
the
employee
takes
the
advantage
of
the
tax
credit,
the
employer
does
not
pay
it.
he
does
not
fund
gross
payroll.
he
does
not
withhold
the
monies.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
yes.
i
agree.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
that's
correct.
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
don't
have
the
$20,
then
how
can
the
trust
attach
to
those
funds?
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
because
there's
been
no
connection
between
the
funds
withheld
from
the
employees
and
the
trust
funds
paid
to
the
government.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
i
believe
that
there
does.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
i
would
represent
to
your
honor
that
if
there
is
the
designation...
if
you...
if
you
go
through
the
steps
to
establish
the
existence
of
a
trust
res--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--because--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--because
in
the
payment
to
the
government
you
are
transferring
title
to
the
property.
what
the
government
wants
to
say
is
allow
us
to
be
preferred
over
every
other
creditor.
we
should
be
preferred.
we
should
have
some
loophole.
if
that
is
what
congress
intended
when
it
enacted
the
bankruptcy
code,
it
should
have
expressly
stated
so.
but
it
didn't
state
that.
it
stated
that
the...
that
the
irs,
that
the
government
was
going
to
be
subject
to
the
preference
laws.
it
was
going
to
be
subject
to
the...
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy
or
the
debtor
himself
from
avoiding
payments
to
the
government.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
i
would
respectfully
disagree.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
but
there
is
no
nexus
between
the
funds
collected
and
the
monies
paid
to
the
government.
there
is
no...
in
this
case,
there
is
absolutely
no
proof
that
the
funds
used
to
pay
the
federal
government
were
those
funds
collected
from
the
employees'
wages.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
at
that
time
they
transfer
title.
they
don't
establish
the
trust.
what
you
are
enabling
by
such
a
ruling
would
be
for
the...
for
the
principals
of
the
corporation
to
in
effect...
to
in
effect
avoid
6672,
100
percent
penalty
liability.
you
are,
in
effect,
carving
out
an
exception
that
does
not
exist
in
the
statute...
while
it
may
have
existed
in
the
proposed
senate
statute,
it
does
not
exist
in
the
statute
as
enacted
to
allow
a
debtor
corporation
to
avoid
100
percent
penalty
payments,
to
allow
the
internal
revenue
service
to
be
preferred
over
other
creditors.
this
court
stated
in
united
states
v.
whiting
pools
that
the
government
should
be
treated
no
differently.
that...
it
stated
in
united
states
v.
slodov
that
there
must
be
a
connection...
there
must
be
some
nexus
when
discussing
this
trust.
if
the
court
finds
in
favor
of
the
government
of
today,
it
would
be
reversing
the
principles
established
by
this
court
in
those
two
cases.
it
would
be
obviating
the
need
for
the
government
to
impose
any
tracing
whatsoever.
it
would
just
say
that
the
trust
arises
by
operation
of
law
without
anything
further.
the
legislative
history...
the
statute
itself
does
not
describe
either
way
whether
the
government
can
or
cannot
avoid
transfers
of
property.
several
courts
have
attempted
to
interpret
whether
congress
intended
when
enacting
the
bankruptcy
code
to
permit
the
government
to
do
just
this,
whether
a
bankruptcy
trustee
can
avoid
a
transfers
of
the
government
to
a
governmental
authority
if
the
property
was
properly
withheld.
each
of
the
courts
have
looked
to
the
statute
and
said
it's
not
clear
and
referred
to
the
legislative
history.
the
legislative
history
was...
as
this
court
has
recognized,
was
a
long
time
in
making.
the
statute
involved
10
years
of
congressional
debate.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
that
is
correct.
and
this...
that
is
correct.
the...
when...
when
the
statute
was
enacted,
the
house
originally
proposed
house
resolution
8200.
the
house
resolution
was
approved
by
the
house
judiciary
committee,
voted
out
of
committee
and
a
report
was
filed.
the
language
in
the
report
is
the
language
referred
by
the
third
circuit
in
their
opinion.
the
house
bill
was
sent
to
the
house
floor,
subject
to
several
amendments
and
passed.
it
was
then
sent
to
the
senate.
the
senate
at
the
time
was
considering
their
own
legislation,
senate
bill
2266.
senate
bill
2266
would
have
specifically
authorized...
would
have
specifically
carved
out
an
exception
that
the
government
desires
today,
that
preference
payments
to
the
government
are
not
avoidable.
the
senate
bill
was
approved
by
the
senate
judiciary
committee.
what
they
did,
though,
is
they
took...
they
tabled
the
bill,
senate
2266,
put
their
language
into
house
resolution
8200
and
sent
it
back
to
the
house.
because
of
the
lateness
of
the
term,
the
two
parties...
the...
the
managers,
the
house
leader
and
the
senate
leaders,
got
together
and,
in
lieu
of
formal
committee,
came
up
with
this
new
statute,
came
up
with
a...
with
a
hybrid
which
imputed
parts
of
the
senate
bill
and
parts
of
the
house
bill.
this
hybrid
bill
is
reflected
in
the
conference
committee
report,
which
is
also
attached
to
the
legislative
history.
that...
that
language
specifically
references
the
fact
that
the
provision
in
the
senate
bill
which
allowed
the
government
to
have
the
ability
to
avoid
taxes
was
specifically
excluded.
senator
deconcini's
statements
stated
that
section
547...
547(b)(2)
of
the
house
amendment
adopts
a
provision
contained
in
the
house
bill
and
rejects
the
alternative
contained
in
the
senate
amendment
relating
to
the
avoidance
of
preferential
transfers,
that
is,
the
payment
of
a
tax
claim
owing
to
a
government
unit.
what
in
effect
this
says
is
that
the...
what
the
senate
proposed
and
what
the
government
is
proposing
today
was
expressly
not
adopted.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
that
is
correct.
in
section...
but
what
congress
did
do
in
enacting
the
bankruptcy
code
in
its
final
text,
it
provided
under
section
106,
which
is
sovereign
immunity
section,
clear
language
that
the
government
would
be
subject
to
the
avoidance
of
preferential
transfers.
in
this
case,
if
the
court
adopts
the
position
as
espoused
by
the
government,
you
would
in
effect
be
overruling
what
congress
had
expressed
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
yes.
that
is
correct.
there...
there
is
a
difference
in
those
taxes,
mr.
justice
stevens.
the
problem,
however,
is
that
there
was
no
express
exclusion
in
the
statute
for
the
non-avoidability
of
even
trust
fund
taxes.
and
certainly
congress
was
cognizant
of
that
fact
by
its...
by
its
protection
of
those...
by
the
protection
of
those
taxes
in
both
section
507,
which
is
the
priority
section,
and
section
523,
which
is
the
discharge
section.
what
congress
said
there
is
that
we
want
to
protect
both
taxes
which
were
collected
and
which
should
have
been
collected.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
under
the
section
507
or
523
analysis?
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
mr.
justice
white,
under
those
sections
they
clearly
had
contemplated
taxes
which
should
have
been
collected
and
which
were
not
collected.
in
the
final
draft
of
the...
of
the
statute
as
enacted
under
547,
they
did
not
include
this
type
of
reference
and
in
the
legislative
history
they
equally
did
not
include
such
a
reference.
justice
marshall
noted
in
the
case
in...
in
this
court
that
under
6672
they
do
in
fact
recognize
taxes
which
were
collected
or
which
should
have
been
collected.
under
547
and
7501
they
do
not.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
i
do,
your
honor.
the
government
suggested
that
the
record
before
the
bankruptcy
court
reflected
that
in
fact
deposits
or
tax
payments
were
made
and
referred
to
form
940
returns.
form
940
returns
would
reflect
federal
unemployment
tax
obligations.
that
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
what
is
at
issue
in
this
case
is
941
taxes
which
would
be
reflected
on
the
941
returns.
government
exhibits
number
11
and
number
12,
which
were
attached
to
the
supplemental
brief
filed
with
the
third
circuit,
clearly
indicated
that
while
the
tax
liability
of
the
debtor
corporation
was
identified,
there
were
no
tax
deposits
made
during
this
time
period.
in
addition,
the
record,
the
joint
appendix,
which
has
attached
to
it
a
copy
of
the
record,
clearly
indicates
when
the
internal
revenue
service,
mr.
alan
zlatkin,
the
revenue
officer,
was
being
questioned
at
the
trial,
he
clearly
indicated--
mr.
paul
j.
winterhalter
--thank
you.
