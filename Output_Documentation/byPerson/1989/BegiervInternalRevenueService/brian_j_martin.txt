mr.
brian
j.
martin
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
where
mr.
winterhalter
left
off.
in
fact,
congress
did
pass
the
house
version
of
section
547,
the
preference
bill,
h.r.
8200.
it
rejected
the
senate
version
which
would
have
made
all
tax
payments
non-avoidable.
it
did
that
to
reach
corporate
income
taxes,
unemployment
taxes.
it's
plain
that
taxes
held
in
trust
and
turned
over
to
the
government
cannot
be
a
preference.
every
court
has
recognized
that.
the
joint
floor
statements
recognize
that.
so,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
trust
was
created
and
maybe
whether
a
trust
was
dissipated.
the
petitioner
has
argued
that
no
trust
was
ever
created.
he
has
not
contended
that
one
was
created
and
somehow
spent
and...
and
rendered
unavailable.
his
argument
has
been
that
there
was
withheld
taxes
placed
in
a
segregated
account.
in
the
first
place,
it's...
it's
plain
that
taxes
were
withheld.
at
trial
irs
forms
940
which
detail
the
amounts
of
withholding
were
placed
into
evidence.
and
it's
roughly
about
$350,000
withheld
each
month
of...
of
the
relevant
months
in
questions.
on
the
question
of
whether
taxes--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--yes.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
no.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
no.
it's...
it's
a
statement
of
these
were
withheld.
it's
not--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--there
were
no
funds
placed
in
a
bank
account.
they
were
net
wages
in
other
words.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
uh-huh.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
the
filing
a
piece
of
paper
their
identifying
it
court
as
genuine,
and
the
document
says--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--and
it
says...
it
says
we
did
it.
it
says
we
withheld.
it
doesn't
say
we
were
required
to
withhold
it.
it
said
we
did
withhold
it.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
exactly.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
not
at
all.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
not
at
all.
i'm
just
saying
if
you
had
an
employer...
not
aia,
but
another
employer
who
paid...
who
paid
gross
wages,
so
there
was
no
withholding
in
the
first
place,
then
we
would
have
trouble
reaching...
finding
a
trust
under
7501.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
but
when
there
is
a
withholding,
that's
my
simple
point.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
right.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
there
has
been
a
withholding
in
that
case.
if--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--well,
they've
have
had
to
pay
less...
they've
have
had
to
pay
less
than
they
would
have
paid...
they
had
to
reduce...
they
cannot
pay
gross
wages.
in
other
words,
if
they
only
have
enough
money,
they
have
to
make
payroll,
and
they
have
to
deduct
on
the
forms
at
least
from
the
paycheck.
a
person's
paycheck...
the
stub
would
say
withholding
of
$105.
the
government
cannot
go
after
that
$105
with
respect
to
that
taxpayer
if
there's
been
that
much
of
a
withholding.
maybe
the
individual
would
have
a
claim
for
wages
against
its
employer.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
well,
that's
right.
on...
on
the
books,
they
didn't
have
to
borrow
the
money
either.
perhaps
they
could
borrow
the
money
if
you
wanted
to
find
an
asset.
withholding
is
just
a
deduction
from
gross
wages.
that's
all
it
means.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
not
paid
is
all
i
mean.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
that's
basically
right.
and
this
is
the
liability
that
if
the
law
is
followed,
will
be
satisfied
usually
within
about
three
to
five
days
by
a
check
to
the
irs.
it
wasn't--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--no.
no.
i...
i'm
saying
under
7501
whenever
a
trust
is
created
and
the
amount
of
tax
withheld...
the
amount
of
tax
withheld
shall
be
held
to
be
a
special
fund
in
trust
for
the
united
states.
it's
a
statutory
trust.
the
trust
is
created
by
operation
of
law.
it's
in
the
amount
of
not
paid.
it's
in
the
amount
of
withheld.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
right.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
uh-huh.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
i
agree.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
i
agree.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
and
with
that--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--yes.
i
think
that
we
would...
wherever
we
found...
found
in
the
commingled
accounts
of
the
withholder
the
amount
of
tax
withheld,
that
that
would
be
the
trust.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
but
you
don't
have
to
decide
that...
fortunately.
[laughter]
but
let
me
just...
you
know,
there
is
evidence
that
congress
thought
that
too
in
1978.
the
joint
floor
statements
addressed
the
question
of
commingled
accounts
and
said
that
the
irs
could
use
reasonable
assumptions,
with
one
such
assumption
being
any
amount
remaining
in
commingled
accounts
is
the
irs'
money.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
absolutely.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
if...
if
they
have
a
parallel
system,
sure.
i
mean,
if...
if
a
trust
is
created
under
law,
under
private
instrument,
whatever
it
is,
payments
of
trust
funds
cannot
be
preferences
because
they're
not
properties
of
the
debtor.
that's
right.
let
me
go
back
to
the
question
you
asked
about...
okay,
a
trust
has
been
created,
but
how
do
we
know
that
the
payments
are
payments
of
trust
fund
taxes.
well,
we
know
in
this
case
because
of
the
black
letter
law
that
a
trustee
may
designate
any
funds,
its
personal
funds,
its
corporate
funds,
whatever
it
wants
to,
as
trust
funds
taxes
or...
as
the
trust
property.
if
they
wrongfully
dissipated
the
trust,
they
can
restore
it
with
any
funds
they
want.
so
when
they
write
a
check
that
clears,
as
in
this
case,
that's
sufficient
to
identify
the...
the
trust.
and
i
think
that's
what
congress
contemplated
in
the
house
report
which
this
court
has
viewed
as
authoritative
of
congress'
intent
in
1978.
when
it
said,
in
the
house
report...
and
this
is
at
page
26
of
our
brief...
that
the
payment
of
withholding
taxes
will
not
be
a
preference
if
they
have
been
properly
been
held
for
payment,
as
they
will
have
been
if
the
debtor
is
able
to
make
the
payments.
so,
we
think
that
congress
thinks
that
if
the
debtor
is
able
to
make
the
payments,
if
the
tax
withholder
can
make
the
payments,
the
checks
clear,
that
no
further
connection
is
required.
now,
there
may
be
cases
if...
where
trust
fund
taxes
are
not
paid
over,
they
file
for
bankruptcy,
when
the
irs
wants
to
identify
the
funds.
in
that
type
of
case,
we
would
be
entitled
to
use
reasonable
assumptions.
one
of
the
assumptions
is
that
any...
any
amounts
remaining
in
commingled
accounts
are
the
taxes.
but
here
we
have
more
than
that.
we
know
that
there
were
amounts
remaining.
the
checks
cleared.
and
we
also
have
the
identification
of
the
payments
as
trust
fund
taxes
by
the
trustee...
in
this
case,
aia.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
well,
that's...
that's
not
what
congress
was
doing
in
'34.
until
1934,
this
liability
was
just
a
tax
debt
and
had
to
be
treated
as
such.
and
congress
wanted
to...
to
say
no,
once
the
withholding
has
occurred,
it's
our
money.
there
can
be
no
higher
secured
interest.
you
know,
if
it's...
it's
secured,
creditors
can't
take
the
money.
it's
our
money.
you
can
use
trust
concepts
to
segregate
and
collect.
i
think
that's
clear.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
yeah,
in
'34...
it
dealt
with
the
excise
taxes
only
and
said
that...
that
money
was
held
in
trust.
it
was
added...
i
think
it
was
'39
or
'40.
whenever
withholding
began
is
when
it
was...
7501
was
amended
to
apply
to
withholdings
in
addition
to
excise
taxes.
i
think
the
last
sentence
of
7501(a)
just
means
that
the
that
the
irs
can
use
the
notice
and
assessment
and
levy
and
lien
provisions
with
respect
to
trust
fund
obligations
if
it
wants
to.
and
we
have
to
in
many
cases.
so,
just
to
summarize
our
position,
we
think
a
trust
is
created
when
there
is
a
withholding,
when...
when
net
wages
are
paid.
no
segregation
is
required.
we
can
require
it
under
section
7512
of
the
code
if
there
has
been
a
poor
performance
by
the
employer.
but
we
don't
have
to
require
a
segregated
account.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
yes.
6672
is
the
100
percent
penalty
provision
for
every
responsible
officer,
and
i
think
there
would
be
a
100
percent
liability
there.
and
there
is
also
a
criminal
penalty
for
willfully
violating
the
trust
fund
obligations.
and
i
think
that
would
fall
within
that.
it's
a...
i
believe
it's
a
misdemeanor
punishable
up
to
one
year.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
it
could
apply
for
willful--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--right.
no,
it
could
apply
in
this...
in
this
type
of
case
as
well.
if...
if...
the
irs
policy
is
to
use
the
100
percent
civil
penalty
before
it
would
use
the
criminal
penalty.
but
there
are
criminal
penalties
for
the
failure
to
turn
over
the
amounts
of
withholdings
to
the
irs.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
no.
it's
not.
mr.
brian
j.
martin
failure
to
turn...
to
deposit--
mr.
brian
j.
martin
--into
the
u.s.
treasury
the
amounts
of
withholding.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
