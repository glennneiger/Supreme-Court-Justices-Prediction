mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
just
like
to
clear
up
one
factual
matter
before
i
begin.
the
appendix
filed
in
the
court
of
appeals
does
contain
the
work
papers
of
the
agent
when
he
issued
the
notice
of
deficiency.
the
notice
of
deficiency
was
issued
because
the
statute
of
limitations
was
about
to
expire
any
day,
and
if
no
notice
had
been
issued,
then
the
whole
matter
would
have
gone
away.
the
reason
for
disallowing
the
attorney's
fee
is
stated
in
the
work
papers.
it
says,
and
i
quote,
"no
amount
is
allowed
as
estate
tax
deduction
for
claimed
attorney's
fees
if
the
estate
has
failed
to
provide
the
internal
revenue
service
with
any
time
record,
estate
records
or
other
documents
in
order
to
make
an
independent
determination
as
to
a
proper
remuneration
for
attorney
services
rendered
to
the
estate.
"
and
then
it
goes
on
to
cite
the
federal
regulation
and
the
matter
of
freeman
case
in
new
york
court.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
absolutely.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
no,
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding
is
not
moot;
the
refund...
the
deficiency
is
being
litigated.
and
we
still
don't
have
the
documents.
we
have
no
court
order
giving
us
any
right
to
the
documents,
and
it's
probably
going
to
be
hard
for
us
to
win
the
refund
case
without
any
documents.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
we
have
the
tax
until
the
refund
suit
is
litigated,
but
we
don't
have
it
to
keep,
yet.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
guess
we
can
ask,
but,
as
far
as
i
know,
the
irs
summons
power
is
broader
than
any
discovery
right
they
would
have
in
district
court,
so
i
assume
if
we
can't
get
it
with
a
summons,
we
can't
get
it
with
discovery,
either.
the
taxpayer
would
make
the
same
argument,
i
suppose,
that
we
just
have
no
reason
to
look
at
these
documents,
because
we
have
to
follow
the
surrogate.
and
they
would
be
not
relevant,
just
as
they
were
viewed
as
not
relevant
by
the
district
court
here.
so,
i
don't...
i
mean
if...
if...
it's
true
that
if
we
had
sought
to
discover
these
documents
and
the
court
had
given
them
to
him,
that
then
the
case
would
be
moot,
but
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
we'll
be
able
to
do
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i'm
not
aware
of
any
irs
policy
to
begin
to
do
this.
i
understand
that
this
is
not
the
first
case
in...
in
this
particular
area
where...
where
the
attorney's
fees
have
been
questioned,
but
there
are
certainly
no--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i...
i
can't
really
answer
that.
but
it
may...
apparently,
what's
happened
is
that
the
office
there
has
determined
that
there
may
be
a
problem
with
attorney's
fees
and
is
looking
at
it
more
seriously
than
maybe
other
offices
in
the
country.
but
they're
certainly
not
willy-nilly
disallowing
all
attorney's
fees
or
issuing
summonses
in
all
cases.
they've
been
looking
at
the
returns
and
seeing
whether
there
is
some
that...
that...
seem
to
be
out
of
line.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i...
i
think
it's
clear
enough
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute
says
that
the
administration
expenses
that
are
allowable
under
state
law
are
to
be
allowed
as
a
state
tax
deduction.
the
question...
the
underlying
merits
question
that's...
that
the
petitioner
has
tried
to
litigate
in
this
case
is
what
does
the
term
"allowable
under
state
law"
mean?
and
we've
said
that
we
think
it
means
the
same
thing
that
the
court
talked
about
in
bosch,
which
is
that
it
depends
whether
the
fee
is,
in
fact,
as
allowable
under
state
law
set
forth
by
the
law
of
the
highest
court.
now,
what
is
prompting
these
investigations
of
fees
is
a
concern
that
the...
there
is
not
sufficient
inquiry
being
made
at
the...
especially
in
these
kind
of...
uncontested
cases
at
the
surrogate
level
as
to
whether
these
fees,
indeed,
are
allowable
under
state
law.
now,
justice--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
not
our
position
yet,
because
we
haven't
been
permitted
to
make
an
investigation.
justice
stevens
asked
if
there--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
yes,
there
is
a
concern
that--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
none
of
these
papers
are
in
the
record;
there
are
some
papers
that
were
shown
to
mr.
white.
his
affidavit
indicates
that
there
have
been
some
reports
in
the
newspapers
in
the
rochester
area.
it
may
be
that...
i
think
part
of
it
just
came
from
looking
at
the
amounts
of
the
fees.
in
this
case,
for
example,
mr.
white
collected
almost
10
percent
of
the
estate,
about
$34,000.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
and
it
doesn't
seem
that
he
did
anything,
as
far
as
we
can
tell.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
then
we
probably
would
have
very
little
reason
to
suspect
that
the...
that
this
fee
was
not
allowable
under
state
law,
and
they
probably
would
not
have
issued
a
summons.
but
that's
not
what
new
york
law
says.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
what
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
said
in
freeman
was,
it
listed
a
whole
host
of
factors,
about
nine
factors
or
something,
that
it
goes
into.
we've
cited
several
appellate
division
cases
in
our
brief,
in
which
fees
were...
surrogates'
awards
of
fees
were
overturned
by
the
appellate...
appellate
division
as
being
excessive.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
justice
blackmun,
we
don't
know
if
we
would
even
disallow
this
deduction.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
that
we
would
disallow--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
we
have
an
agent
who
is
trying
to
make
an
investigation.
now,
whether
this
is
ultimately
going
to
end
up
in
a
lot
of
tax
for
the
irs
or
not,
i
don't
know,
and
he
doesn't
know
either,
until
he
can
make
the
investigation.
now,
it
happens
the
fee
in
this
case
is
not
very
large.
for
larger
estates,
there
may
be
larger
fees.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
don't
think
we're
making
such
a
fuss
over
it,
frankly.
i
mean,
i
understand
the
case
is
here
now,
and
that's...
we
didn't
bring
it
here.
all
we
did
was
issue
a
summons.
i
don't
know
how
many
summonses
are
issued
over
the
course
of
the
year,
but
there
are
quite
a
few.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yes,
we
did
issue
the
summons,
because
the
agent--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
agent
looked
at
the
return
and
he
thought
there
was
reason
to
suspect
the...
the
fee
was
not
allowable.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i
understand
that
petitioner
has
claimed
in
his
reply
brief
that
we
have
state
tax
attorneys
who
are
sitting
around
with
nothing
to
do
and
this
isn't
what
we
should
be
doing.
but
i
think
if
there's
one
thing
that
this
court
has
made
clear,
and
it's
a
quote
from
page
56
of
powell,
it
is,
"congress
did
not
intend
the
courts
to
oversee
the
commissioner's
determinations
to
investigate.
"
"it
is
no
basis
for
refusing
to
enforce
a
summons
to
say
that
the
service
ought
to
be
focusing
on
something
else.
"
and
i
suppose
there
are
a
lot
of
taxpayers
out
there
who,
let's
say,
take
liberties
with
certain
small
items
on
their
return
because
they
think
the
service
has
got
more
important
things
to
do.
but
i
think
that's
a
lot
of
gall
to
turn
that,
i
guess,
attempt
to
get
away
with
something
into
a
right
to
actually
challenge
the
service,
when
the
service
does
happen
to
look
into
one
of
these
smaller
matters.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
there
is
no
next
step,
justice
blackmun.
there
is...
the
first
step
here
is
to
try
to
get
these
records.
and
i
don't
know
what
is
going
to
happen
after
that,
frankly.
there
have
been
cases
that
are
cited
in
our
brief
where
claims
allowed
by
probate
courts
have
been
disallowed
by
the
irs;
there
are
not
many.
and
as
far
as
i
know,
there
are
not
many
of
these
attorney's
fee
cases.
justice
stevens
asked
before
how
many
there
were,
and
as
far
as
i
know,
there
is
not
a
single
case
in
this
district
where
that
has
actually
been
litigated
whether
the
service
can
disallow
the
fee.
but
i
would
really
like
to
emphasize
that
this
is
a
summons
enforcement
proceeding
here,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it
complicates
the
question.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
simplifies
the
question
that's
before
the
court.
it
just
presents
the
usual
issue
that's
presented
in
a
summons
case:
whether
this...
irs
summonses
should
be
enforced.
and
we
submit
that
under
powell,
under
the
usual
rules
for
summons
enforcement
established
and
reaffirmed
by
this
court,
the
answer
is
clearly
yes.
it's
a
very
simple
analysis.
the
summonses
were
issued
to
enable
the
irs
to
investigate
the
correctness
of
the
estate's
return,
specifically,
this
one
item
on
the
return:
whether
the
deduction
for
attorney's
fees
was
valid
under
section
2053
of
the
code,
as
allowable
under
state
law.
that's
a
proper
purpose
for
issuing
a
summons.
there's
no
basis
for
believing,
and
no
allegation
really,
that
the
investigation
is
being
made
in
bad
faith
or
for
some
other
collateral
purpose.
and
therefore
we
submit
that
the
summonses
should
have
been
enforced.
now--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that's
absolutely
right.
that
is
clear
from
powell
that
the
service
doesn't
have
to
explain
its
determination
to
investigate
or
make
any
sort
of
probable
cause
or
lesser
showing
as
to
why
it
wants
to
investigate.
it
is
entitled
to
allocate
its
investigative
resources
as
it
sees
fit.
now--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--absolutely
right.
there
are
at
least...
at
least
two
reasons
why...
why
that
wouldn't
make
a
difference
at
this
stage.
i...
i
guess
respondent
is
trying
to...
if
the
statute
said...
if
section
2053
said...
i
think
it
was
justice
rehnquist's
hypothetical
that
the
attorney
is
entitled
to
10
percent
of
the
estate,
and
we're
going
to
allow
that
for
a
deduction,
and
he
took
a
10
percent
deduction.
or
if
it
said
that
whatever
the
surrogate
says
is
absolutely
final,
no
matter
whatever
happens.
if
the
statute
said
that
on
its
face,
and
then
the
irs
issued
a
summons
like
this,
claiming
that
it
wants
to
investigate
the
merits
of
that
deduction,
the
taxpayer
could
reasonably
come
into
the
summons
enforcement
court
and
say,
look,
there's
nothing
for
them
to
investigate.
it's
clear
as
a
bell,
it's
clear
to
us,
it's
clear
to
you,
it's
clear
to
them
that
they're
not
going
to
be
able
to
disallow
this
deduction
down
the
road.
now,
that
would
arguably
raise
an
inference
that
there
was
an
improper
purpose
for
the
summons,
that
if
the
purpose
was
something
other
than
what
was
stated.
and
that
might...
and
that
probably
would
justify
denial.
but
that's
not
what's
going
on
here.
we
can
argue
about
what
section
2053
means,
whether
bosch
applies,
what
sort
of
deference
is
required
to
the
surrogate,
but
nothing...
their
argument
that
bosch
shouldn't
apply
does
not
suggest
any
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
agent.
as
justice
scalia
said,
we
don't
know
what
section
2053
means,
and
it's
not
the
place
to
litigate
the
merits
here.
it's
a
summons
enforcement--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--that...
that's...
that's
the
second
point
that
i
wanted
to
get
to.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
we've
talked
about
fraud
a
little
bit
because--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
that's
so,
i
suppose.
there
might
be
fraud
there,
too.
but
let's
suppose
the
statute
said
even
if
there
is
fraud,
that...
that
you
still
have
to
follow
it.
i
mean--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the...
the
only
way
in
which...
looking
down
the
road
to
the
merits...
could
effect
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding,
it
seems
to
me,
is
if
it
raised
an
inference
of
bad
faith
on
the
part
of
the
agent,
that
it
was
clear
enough
that
the
stated
purpose
of
investigating
tax
liability
was
not
the
true
purpose,
and
that's
not
the
case
here.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
that...
that's
one
of
the
things
that...
that...
that
i
think
was
a
contributing
factor
in
the
decision
to
investigate
this
return,
because
it
makes
it
a
little
more
questionable
what
the
surrogate
might
have
done.
i
mean,
there--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
new
york
law
allows
the
same
individual
to
serve
as
both
executor
and
attorney,
but
new
york
law
clearly
does
not
allow
him
to
collect
a
double
fee
for
the
same
services.
and
there
are
health
division
cases
that
have
interfered
with
that.
so,
our
concern
here
was
whether
he
in
fact
didn't
do
any
work
as
attorney
that's
distinct
from
what
the
executor
would
do,
and
whether
the
attorney's
fee
was
really
being
paid
for
the
same
services.
that's
why
we
asked
him
to
at
least
give
us
an
affidavit.
before
the
summons
was
ever
issued,
he
was
just
asked
to
give
an
affidavit
of
what
he
did
for
the
estate
that
warranted
this
fee,
and
he
refused
to
provide
that.
for
all
we
know,
he
didn't
do
more
than
half-an-hour's
or
an
hour's
worth
of
attorney's
work.
and
there
would
be
an
issue,
i
suppose,
under
new
york
law,
whether
a
$17,000
attorney's
fee
is
valid
under
new
york
for
an
hour's
worth
of
work.
but
we
would
probably
question
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
and
that
would
be
litigated
in
another
proceeding.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
i've
never
probated
an
estate,
no.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record
as
to
what
the
attorney
did.
in
respondent's
brief
they...
on
page
5
of
their
brief,
in
a
statement
they
list
various
things
that
mr.
white
did.
and
almost
all
of
these,
it
seems
to
me,
are...
are...
refer
to
executor's
duties.
so,
i
don't
think
there's
anything
wrong
with
the
agent
at
least
wondering
whether
in
fact
there
was
an
independent
attorney's
work,
separate
from
what
the
executor
had
done,
that
warranted
this
kind
of
fee.
but
that's...
if
the
agent
is
wrong,
the
district
court
will
tell
him
so
or
in
fact
the
irs
might
never
disallow
the
deduction.
the
fact
is
that
we're
just
trying
to
find
out
what
he
did
and
whether
there's
any
basis
for
challenging
the
deduction.
i
think
that
the
entire
case
here
has
been
confused
by...
by
the
petitioner's
decision
to
litigate
it
by
looking
down
the
road
at
the
outcome
of
the
investigation...
possible
outcome
of
the
investigation,
and
then
trying
to
reason
backwards
and
say,
since
our
position
is
the
irs
is
probably
not
going
to
win,
ultimately,
or
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
disallow
the
deduction,
then
they
shouldn't
issue
the
summons
in
the
first
place.
that's
not
the
way
the
summons
enforcement
proceedings
are
supposed
to
be
handled.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
justice
blackmun,
as
i
said
before,
i
mean,
there...
there
has
yet
to
be
a
case
where
we've
actually
been
litigating
whether
the
fee
should
be
disallowed
or
not.
and
it's
perfectly
possible
that
in
this
case
we
would
look
at
the
records
of
whatever
he
did
and
determine
that
the
fee
should
not
be
disallowed.
the
surrogate
has
a
certain
element
of
discretion
here.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
but
i'm
sure
you
recognize
that
there
can
be
abuses
in
this
area
and
we
can't
find
out--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--if
he
did
work
for
attorney,
probably
some
fee
is
allowable.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
and
i
doubt
very
much
we
would
have
disallowed
the
whole
fee
if
we
had
the
records.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
surrogate
did
allow
it.
and
that
is
the
issue.
that
is
the
second
issue
in
this
case,
which
is
whether
the
surrogate's
allowance
of
the
fee
is
something
that
we
have
to
defer
to.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
well,
i
disagree
with
that,
justice
stevens,
on...
on
two
grounds.
first
of
all--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--no,
my
hypothetical
is
not
if
you
ultimately
construe
the
statute
that
way;
my...
my
hypothetical--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--yes,
sir.
[laughter]
yes,
that's--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
we
have
more
than
an
arguable
position,
we
have
a
decision
out
of
this
court
that's
directly
on
point.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
pretty
close.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
the
estate
of
bosch.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
who--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--who...
well--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--the
court
did
not...
as
i
recall,
the
court
did
not
focus
on
whether
it
was
a
collusive
suit
or
not.
and,
in
fact--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--well,
i...
i
mean,
i
understand
that.
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
to
try
to
distinguish
it
on
its
facts,
but
i
think
the
holding
of
the
court
is
that
what...
what
the
code
means
when
it
talks
about
applying
state
law
in...
in
the
case
of
a
federal
estate
tax
deduction,
what
it
means
is
applying
the
law
as
set
forth
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state.
and
the
two
dissenters
in
that
case,
justice
harlan
and
justice
fortas,
wanted
to
limit
the
court's
decision
just
to
the...
to
cases
where
there
was
no
contest
in
the
state
court,
where
it
was,
if
not
collusive,
at
least
consented
or
something.
and
the
court
didn't...
the
majority
did
not
do
that.
so,
i
think
at
least
the
agent
certainly
has
very
strong
reason
to
think
here
that
he...
that
he
can
do
it--
and,
apart
from
that
point,
though,
i
don't
want
to
let
slide
the
fact
that
the
petitioner
and
the
district
court
have
conceded
that
the
statute
is
not
as
we
said
in
the
hypothetical,
that
it
can
be
set
aside
under
certain
conditions.
now,
how
likely
those
conditions
are
to
occur
is
not
something
to
be
determined
before
we're
allowed
to
make
an
investigation.
in
fact,
i
think
that's
most
clearly
stated
in
petitioner's
reply
brief
at
page...
pages
9
and
10.
i...
i
read
as
a
concession
that
the
irs
can
issue
a
summons
to
the
attorney
of
the
estate
as
a...
as
a
means
of
conducting
an
investigation
of
an
attorney's...
of
the
legitimacy
of
an
attorney's
fee
that
has
been
approved
by
the
surrogate.
that's
exactly
what
it
says
here.
now...
because
of
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
fraud.
now,
what
respondent...
i'm
sorry,
petitioner's
defense,
that...
that
he
still
maintains,
is
that
that's
not
applicable
in
this
case
because
the
irs
agent
didn't
say
that
he
was
investigating
fraud
at
the
time
he
issued
the
summonses.
and
so,
maybe
you
can
do
that
in
another
case,
but
not
in
this
one.
but
i
think
it's
clear
enough
that
we
don't
have
to
say
at
the
outset
of
our
investigation
where
the
investigation
is
going.
in
fact,
we
don't
know.
and
there's
no
reason
to
we
should
be
expected
to
know.
the
nature
of
an
investigation
is
that
you
start
looking
into
a
particular
area.
as
you
develop
facts,
your
attention
becomes
more
focused;
then
you
move
along
and
maybe
you
find
fraud,
maybe
you
find
that
the
deduction
was
perfectly
reasonable,
or
maybe
you
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
surrogate
made
a
mistake
of
new
york
law.
but
we
don't
know
where
it's
going
to
go
in
the
beginning.
to...
in
order
to
get
an
irs
summons
enforced,
we
have
to
allege
a
purpose
of
investigating
tax
liability.
that
was
clearly
the
purpose
here.
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case,
i
think,
from
that
perspective.
now,
the
second
issue
in
the
case
is
one
that
we
have
stated
in
our
brief
that
we
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
reach
because...
for
the
reasons
i've
just
discussed.
i
think
the
summons
has
to
be
enforced
in
any
case,
no
matter...
whether
bosch
applies
or
not.
but
the
court
could
reach
it,
and
i'd
just
like
to
talk
about
it
briefly.
we
think
it
is
clear,
from
the
language
of
the
statute,
from
using
the
terms
allowable
under
state
law,
and
from
the
history
of
the
statute
from
its
beginning,
that
section
20...
2053
does
not
set
up
a
test
of
looking
at
whether
the
surrogate
has,
as
a
historical
fact,
allowed
a
particular
deduction.
the
idea
is
to
make
an
inquiry
into
state
law.
the
reasons
for
that
rule
are
explained
by
the
court
in
bosch,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
have
a
different
rule
for
this
particular
estate
deduction
than
there
is
for
the
marital
deduction
that
was
at
issue
there.
we
don't
think
the
taxpayer
has
any--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
[inaudible]
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
yeah,
you're
suggesting
that
bosch
could
be
restricted
to
its
facts,
and
that--
mr.
alan
i.
horowitz
--all
right.
well,
what
i
was
responding
to
was...
was
the
argument
the
petitioner
made
that
bosch
applies
only
to
the
marital
deduction,
section
2056,
and
shouldn't
apply
here
to
section
2053.
i
think
justice
stevens'
point
would
be
that,
even
in
the
marital
deduction
context,
bosch
should
be
given
an
extremely
narrow
reading.
and,
as
i
say,
we
disagree
with
that,
but
that's
something
that
would
be
litigated
down
the
road,
i
think,
in...
in
a
refund
suit
here.
but
at
least
what
the
court
said
in
bosch,
i
think,
is
that
state
law
means
the
law
of
the
highest
court,
and
that
the
irs
should
not
be
bound
by
mistakes
of
state
law,
of
lower
courts.
now,
i...
i
would
just
like
to
say
that
we
don't
think
this
is
really
opening
a
great
pandora's
box
and
federalism
concerns
and
all
this.
the
irs,
for
reasons
that
the
court
seems
to
be
well
aware
of,
is
not
likely
to
go
out
willy-nilly,
disallowing
all
these
fees
and
bringing
them
into
court.
and
certainly
the
district
courts
are
not
likely
to
be
second
guessing
the
surrogates
willy-nilly.
i
think
the
problem
is
possible
abuses
here.
and
the
district
courts
aren't
going
to
want
to
invite
this
kind
of
litigation;
they're
only
going
to
step
in
and
disagree
with
the
surrogate
if
there's
a
real
problem
here.
and
all
we
want
is
to
be
able
to
conduct
an
investigation
and
find
out
if
there
is
a
real
problem.
unless
there
are
any
questions--
