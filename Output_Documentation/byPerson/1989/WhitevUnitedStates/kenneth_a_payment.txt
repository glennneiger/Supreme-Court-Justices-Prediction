mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
case
about
federalism
and
the
right
of
the
internal
revenue
service
to
second-guess
the
determination
of
state
trial
courts,
as
has
been
held
by
the
court
below,
the
second
circuit.
the
case
grew
out
of
a
recent
campaign
by
the
internal
revenue
service
of
disallowing
the
estate
tax
deductions
for
attorney's
fees
on
estate
tax
returns.
this
campaign,
over
the
recent
years,
has
consisted
of
collateral
attacks
as
to
state
probate
decrees.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
it
started
in
the
western
district
of
new
york;
it
has
spread
to
other
parts
of
new
york
and
apparently
could
be
expected
to
spread
nationwide,
depending
on
the--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--that...
that
is
true.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
so
it
would
seem,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
i...
that
is
our
position,
indeed,
that
as
the
second
circuit
mentioned,
one
would
well
wonder
why
the
internal
revenue
service
would
deploy
its
forces
in
this
manner.
but,
in
any
event,
these
attacks
have
persisted,
and
they
have
been
made
notwithstanding
that
orders
of...
of
the
probate
courts
have
become
final
and
binding
on
the
estate,
notwithstanding--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--that's
correct.
notwithstanding--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--it
was
unheard
of
until
three
or
four
years
ago,
your
honor.
justice
blackmun,
i
don't
think,
other
than
a
few
isolated
cases
you
would
find
under
2053,
in
different
areas,
not
attorney's
fee
issues,
that
you
would
see
a
lot
of
cases,
even
after
the
bosch
case.
these
attacks
are
made
notwithstanding--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
government
does
not
have
to
appear
in
such
cases,
and,
as
a
matter
of
policy,
never
does
appear.
but
it
could
have
chosen
to
appear
in
the
state
court
proceeding--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--i
understand
there
is
a
difference,
your
honor,
but...
and...
and
of
course,
we
do
not
assert
res
judicata
principles
apply
here.
but
what's
happening
is
that
the
dispute
is
moving
out
of
the
state
court
into
the
federal
courts.
when
you
have
a
determination
that
is
binding
on
all
the
parties
to
the
estate,
who,
in
most
cases,
have
already
consented
to
the
result,
the
surrogate
court
or
the
probate
court
has
made
an
order,
it's
final,
the
amount
that
has
been
assessed
is...
routine
and
the
fact
is
that
the
amount
has
been
paid,
and
the
beneficiaries
of
the
estate
are
stuck
with
the
result.
they
have
no
way--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--that's
correct,
it
does
come
up
in
that
context.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
that
is
very
true.
you
had
two
cases
in
the
last
year.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
and
there...
have
had
many
in
the
last
24
or
<five>
[=
5]
years
since
the
powell
case,
and
the
government
almost
always
wins,
and
the
policy
comes--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--out
the
same
way
every
time.
the
literal
policy
is
in
favor
of
enforcement.
but
i
think
you
have--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--well,
that
depends
on
whether
our
position
is
correct
or
not
on
bosch
and
on
2053.
if
we're
right--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--well--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--first
of
all,
we're
dealing
with
a
different
statute
than
was
involved
in
the
bosch
case.
so
we're
not
seeking
to
overrule
or
really
touch
upon
bosch.
but
we
have
commented
and
alerted
the
court
to
the
fact,
at
least
through
one
law
review
article
that
summarizes
this
very
well,
that
the
decisions
since
bosch
have
been
all
over
the
lot;
that
the
federal
courts
have
had
a
very
difficult
time
in
dealing
with
a
proper
purpose
test,
and
simply
haven't
been
able
to
consistently
apply
it.
you
have
cases
in
which
proper
purpose
is
read
to
mean...
or
rather,
excuse
me...
the
concept
of
proper
regard
is
read
to
mean
no
regard.
you
have
cases
in
which...
that
go
180
degrees
the
other
way
and
give
preclusive
effect
to
the
determination
of
the
state
court.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
in...
in
the
sense
that
if
you
do
not
have
a
proper
purpose
for
a
summons
enforcement
proceeding,
that
is
bad
faith.
that
is
the
antithesis
of
good
faith.
because,
if
we
are
right
about
our
construction
of
2053
and
of
the
bosch
case,
that
means
that
the
state
court's
determination
is
preclusive.
it
should
end
the
inquiry.
and
if
it
ends
the
inquiry,
then
you
can't
have
a
proper
purpose.
and
if
they
come
into
court--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--well,
to
treat
those
subjects
one
at
a
time.
the
government
has
made
much
of
the
district
court's
imposing
of
prima
facie
tests,
a
prima
facie
showing
of
fraud
test.
the
district
court
in
this
case
didn't
have
to
go
that
far.
it
didn't
really
have
a
case
in
which
the
internal
revenue
service
asserted
that
there
was
fraud
involved.
you
will
recall
that
in
the
powell
case,
there
were
explicit
allegations
to
the
effect
that
the
revenue
agent
expected...
or
suspected
fraud.
but
this
case
came
in
on
a
record
where
the
internal
revenue
service
simply
said,
in
effect,
reiterated
the
statutory
rubric,
said
that
we're
interested
in
making
a
correct
determination
of
the
tax
liability,
and
to
determine
the
estate's
liability
for
tax,
and
didn't
explicitly
state
that
they
were
suspecting
fraud.
and,
indeed,
in
the
lower
court,
the
transcript
of
the
hearing
can
be
read
from
end
to
end
and
you
will
not
find
a
claim
by
the
internal
revenue
service
that
there
might
be
fraud
involved.
in
fact,
they
specifically
disclaimed
that
notion
in
their--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--i
understand.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
let's
say
that
were
the
case,
not...
not
what
is
actually
happening,
but
that...
hypothetical
were
the
case.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
if,
as
a
first
instance,
the
decree
is
binding,
you
can
see
that
there
ought
to
be
something
more
in
this
kind
of
a
case,
because
it's
so
different.
in
the
powell
setting
and
almost
every
other
setting
that
this
court
has
ever
dealt
with,
you
have
an
individual
tax
payer
who
has
an
ability
to
hide
the
records,
who
has
an...
has
a...
a
purpose
in
hiding
the
records.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
that's
true,
unless
you
don't
have
to
do
it.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
it
was
mr.
white's
position
that
he
didn't
have
to
do
it.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
that
the
state
court
decree
should
have
been
given--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--they
weren't
satisfied
with
those
records.
they
could
see
those
records.
they
went
to
the
surrogates
court
and
they
could
see
what
the
surrogate
had
looked
at.
they--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--the
time
sheets
were
not
in
the
records.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if...
if
he
was
focusing
on
that--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--that
would
be...
that...
if
we
were
in
surrogates
court
and
that
inquiry
was
made
of
mr.
white,
i
am
sure
he
would
have
turned
them
over.
he
would
have
had
no
choice,
because
the
court
had
an
obligation
to
the
beneficiaries
of
the
estate
and...
and
to
cover
its
own
obligations,
as
a
court,
to
look
into
such
matters,
if
it
felt
they
were
important.
but
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
as
we
have
made
very
clear,
has
listed
nine
factors
that
the
courts
look
to.
and
those
nine
factors
are
largely
subjective.
other
than
time
required
for
the
project,
they
are
very
subjective
factors,
and
local
custom,
local
practice
is
an
appropriate
consideration
under
the
freeman
case,
and
so
the
freeman
case
held.
and
the
freeman
case,
in
fact,
involved,
in
effect,
a
minimum
bar
fee
schedule
sometime
before
the
goldfarb
case
was
in
this
court.
and
the
court
held
that,
so
long
as
the
surrogate
made...
this
is
in
freeman...
so
long
as
the
surrogate
made
an
independent
judgment,
it
could
use
those
bar
schedules,
and
they,
in
effect,
provided
for
a
percentage.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
i'm...
i'm
saying
that
the
internal
revenue
service
can
look
at
the
same
material
that
the
surrogate
looks
at.
and
if
the
surrogate
makes...
is
willing
to
make
an
eyeball
judgment,
and...
and...
and
apparently
he
did,
as...
as
the
record
reveals,
if
he
is
willing
to
make
that
kind
of
an
assessment,
based
on
his
long-term
experience,
in
office,
knowing
what's
required,
looking
at
the
accounting,
for
example,
and
knowing
that
the
accounting
required
a
certain
amount
of
work,
then
that
ought
to
be
binding--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--because
it's
binding--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--the
irs
wants
to
make
an
eyeball
judgment,
but
an
eyeball
judgment
with
a
microscope.
they
wish
to
examine
time
records.
and
they
are
focused
on
the
time
records,
and
that's
all
they're
focused
on.
they're...
in
fact,
what
is
so
impressive
about
the
record
in
this
case
is
that
only
in
this
court
did
they
ever
mention
any
possible
fraud
issue;
only
in
this
court
for
the
first
time.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
oh,
certainly.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
not
with
the
irs
in...
in...
you
mean
in
connection
with
the
federal
case--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--mr.
white
paid...
or
rather
the
estate
paid,
apparently,
a...
because
the
internal
revenue
service
disallowed
the
entire
fee,
paid
a
deficiency,
and
has
brought
a
companion
action,
a
refund
action
in
the
federal
district
court,
in
which,
of
all
things,
the
internal
revenue
service
has
demanded
a
jury
trial
to
have
this
entire
matter
relitigated.
so
that
case
is
pending
down
there...
really
awaiting
the
outcome
of
this
case--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--didn't...
didn't
disallow
a
portion,
disallowed
the
entire
attorney's
fee.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
none
that's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
i
am
not
sure
i
understand--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--i'm
sure
that
that
was
their
position.
the
subpoena...
the
summons
had
not
been
obeyed,
and
therefore,
as
sort
of
a
punitive
measure,
the
entire
deduction
was
disallowed.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
the
rule
is,
to
start
with,
that
once
the
state
court
has
spoken,
as
it...
as
it
did
in
this
case,
that's...
that's
preclusive,
that
the
internal
revenue
service
can
go
no
further.
they
would
have
to
have
something
else
in
order
to
proceed.
i
mean,
it's
true
that
powell
comes
down
on
a
very
clear
policy
line
of
cases
where
enforcement
takes
place--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--again
and
again.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
there
are--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--but
there
are
no
mysteries
here.
there's
nothing
that
the
internal
revenue...
revenue
service
can't
figure
out
from
looking
at
the
probate
decree.
and
if
the...
and
particularly
in
this
case,
and
they
certainly
know
what
the
practice
is
in
western
new
york,
for
example.
if
the
judge
says,
i
keep
the
attorney's
fee
just
short
of
an
executor's
commission,
that's
my
local
practice,
that's
my
custom,
well,
he
isn't
spending
time
on
time.
he's
not
concerned
about
time
at
all.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
he's
making
the
other
judgments
that
freeman
permit
him
to
make.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
right.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
exactly
so.
in
other
words,
if
this
appears
to
be
within
his
own
guidelines,
he
knows...
you
know
what
his
guidelines
are,
fine.
if
it
was
90
percent
of
the
estate,
for
example,
now
we
might
have
a
case
where
they
have
to
look
further.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
just
peer
below
the
surface
and
ask
the
question,
what's
going
on
here?
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
certainly.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
because
they
would
have
grounds
to
suspect.
let's
say
that
it
was
90
percent
of
the
estate,
and
we
didn't
have
anything
unusual;
it
was
just
a
routine
administration,
and
that's
clear--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--if
you
have
that
kind
of
a
finding,
then
they
haven't
got
any
reason
to
suspect
fraud.
but
if
you
didn't
have
that
kind
of
a
finding--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--and
you
had
a
routine
sort
of...
of
a
case--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--not
at
all.
i
think...
i
think
there
are
instances
where,
looking
at
the
record
that
he
has
in
front
of
him,
there
is
something
unique
and
something
troublesome.
but
in
the
normal
case...
i
mean
this
concept
of
doing
sort
of
random
audits
now
and
again...
that
doesn't
fly
in
an
instance
where
a...
you
have
a
court,
a
state
court,
acting
on
a
subject
like
this,
where
the
determinations
are
presumed
to
be
correct
and
presumed,
especially--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--if
we
litigate
it
out--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--if
we
go
into
the
refund
case.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
but...
but--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--well,
the
internal
revenue
service
says
no.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
the
internal
revenue
service's
position
is
they're
entitled
to
jury
trials
in
such
cases,
they're
entitled
to
drag
the
surrogate
in,
i
guess,
and
have
him
testify
under
oath
as
to
what
he
did.
they...
they
say
the
bosch
case
requires
that
you
give
proper
regard
to
state
decrees.
well,
if
you're
going
to
give
them
any
kind
of
regard,
isn't
it
so
that
you'll
have
to
have
him
come
in
as
a
witness?
the
surrogate
has
to
come
in
and
explain
exactly
how
he
arrived
at
this,
notwithstanding
that
he
didn't
look
at
the
time,
notwithstanding
he
used
the
freeman
factors
besides
time.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
we're
in
federal
court;
that's
the
neutral
tribunal.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
there
should
be
a
loss
in
a
case
like
that,
but
i
don't
think
the
internal
revenue
service
ought
to
be
coming
in
with
these
summonses,
either,
and
causing
this
sort
of
disruption.
this,
obviously,
exerts
a
subtle
pressure
in
the
estate
audit.
in
the
examination
of
the
entire
return,
this
can
result
in
a
collateral
of...
of
possibly
getting
concessions
along
the
line
on
other
matters.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
because
you're
asking...
you're
putting
the
negotiator
in
a...
in
a
very
touchy
position.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
because
he
hasn't
complied.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
because
he
has
not
complied
with
the
summons.
he
has
refused
to
comply
with
the
summons.
and
even
though
there
is
a
refund
case
out
there,
that
refund
case
is
a
separate
matter
entirely.
and,
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
has
not
complied
with
the
summons,
this
will
dog
him
in...
in
the
rest
of...
of
the
matter.
it's
a
separate
case,
in
fact.
so
there
is
no
mootness
as
a
result
of
this.
in
fact,
his
obligation,
pending
this
determination,
is...
is
simply
been
stayed.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
but,
if
the
result
is
that
you
affirm--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--i...
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
we
need
to
come
to
grips
with
the
issue
of
the
preclusive
effect
of
state
court
decrees.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
we
didn't
come
all
this
way--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--well,
that
won't
be
from
the
united
states
supreme
court;
that'll
be
from
a
district
court.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
they
would
certainly
do
so
in
the
normal
discovery
process.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
well,
it
all
depends.
if,
in
the
summons
enforcement
case
pending
here...
and,
in
fact,
all
the
proceedings
have
been
stayed
by
mutual
agreement
of
the
parties...
in...
in...
in
this
case,
if
the
court
determines
that
the
material
didn't
need
to
be
turned
over,
it
doesn't
need
to
be
turned
over
in
connection
with
discovery
in
the
refund
action,
either.
that
should
preclude
the
matter.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
i...
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
there
can
ever
be
a
proper
purpose
for
issuing
a
summons,
where
the
state
court
decree
has
a
preclusive
effect.
this
case
is
so
different
from
the
bosch
case.
this
case
doesn't
involve
parties
running
to
the
state
court
to
get
a
determination
that
would
affect
tax
liability.
in
fact,
the
parties
are
captives
of
the
state
court.
it's
the
only
place
where
you
can
resolve
this
matter,
by
constitution
of
the
state
of
new
york
and
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
there
has
always
been
a
probate
exception
to
diversity
jurisdiction,
there
is
no
other
place
to
do
this.
so,
as
a
matter
of
getting
the
matter
resolved
properly,
the
only
place
to
go
is
in
the
surrogate
court.
and
in
the
surrogate
court,
when
you
get
a
result,
it's
binding
on
the
beneficiaries.
and
when
it's
binding
on
the
beneficiaries,
the
result
is
that
if
they
don't
get
the
deduction,
they're
in...
unfairly
impacted.
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
there
is
no
good
reason
for
federal
courts
to
get
involved
in
this
humdrum
business
of
fixing
estate
attorneys'
fees.
all
the
time,
this
court
is
looking
for
ways
in
which
to
ensure
that,
properly,
matters
that
are
in
state
courts
stay
in
state
courts.
the
abstention
doctrines
and
all
other
sorts
of
doctrines
that
recognize
principles
of
federalism,
all
point
the
way
towards
keeping
significant
issues
in
the
state
courts.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
this
case
goes
the--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--it
was
a
$450,000
estate.
the
executor's
commission
was
around
17,000,
and
the
attorney's
fee
was
around
16,000,
roughly--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--it
was
in
line
with
the
judge's
own
local
custom
of...
first
of
all,
you
have
to
understand,
the
executor's
commission
is
fixed
by
statute,
and
so
it
doesn't
vary.
there's
a
minimum
percentage
of
the
estate.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
fixed
by
statute.
one
of
our
points
is
if
this
case
had
been
in
the
state
of
california,
instead
of
the
state
of
new
york,
in
california
they
fix
both
the
attorney's
fee,
as
a
statutory
minimum,
and
the
fee
of
the
executor,
as
a
statutory
minimum.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
and
you
couldn't
have--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--was
about
16,000,
and
the
executor's
commission
was
about
17,000
and
some
odd
change.
so,
in
keeping
with
what
the
judge
declared
to
be
his...
his
normal
routine,
he
was
keeping
the
attorney
fee
something
less
than
the
fee
of
the
executor.
but
as
i
was
saying--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--he
was
in
this
case,
which
is
permitted
under
new
york
law.
and
really
what
the--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--that's...
that's
correct.
and
they
allege
that
that
was
the
reason
why
they
were
especially
looking
here.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
it's
permitted
under
new
york
law,
and
he
had
an
announced...
that
is
to
say,
the
surrogate
had
an
announced
local
practice,
and
he
followed
it
in
this
case,
and
he
wasn't...
he
wasn't
bound
to
look
at
time
as
the
exclusive
determinant
of
this
issue.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
only
if
this
court
believes
that
the
bosch
decision
requires
that
result.
but
looking
at
2053
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
looking
at
the
park
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit,
and
the
jenner
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit,
the
answer
has
to
be
no,
that
there
should
be
no
second
guessing.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
it
doesn't
follow
that
every
one
is,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
once
it's
been
done--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--that's
what
they
seek
to
do,
but
they--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--they...
they
cannot
do
it,
because
2053
of
the
internal
revenue
code
makes
state
law
binding.
and
freeman
tells
us--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--and
freeman...
freeman...
that's
true,
but
freeman
governs
the
exact
discussion
here,
and
the
surrogate
contended
that
he
followed
the
freeman
case,
and
the
freeman
case
has
mainly
subjective
factors,
not
just
time.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
and
involve
the
federal
courts
in
relitigating
this
very
matter,
just
as
in
the
refund...
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
bad
faith,
in
our
view,
is
the
same
as
an
improper
purpose.
and
if
the
purpose
is
not
proper
because
you
cannot
second
guess
the
surrogate's
decree,
you
cannot
relitigate
this
matter,
then
there
is
no
proper
purpose.
and
if
there
is
no
proper
purpose,
then
the
summons
is
in
bad
faith.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
apparently
that
was
through
some
negotiations
on
incorrect
mathematical
calculation.
that
was
through
negotiations
with
the
revenue
agent.
that
is
correct.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
well,
he...
before
this
summons
enforcement
proceeding,
the
matter
was
conceded,
yes.
because
it
was
a
mathematical
error,
in
effect.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
well,
one
of
the
things
is
that
that
wasn't
implicated
in
the
summons
enforcement
end
of
the
thing;
it
happened
before
they
brought
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
i
don't
think
that
the
internal
revenue
service
would
come
into
federal
court
on
a
mathematical
error
issue
ever.
but
if
they
did--
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
--well,
perhaps
so.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
matter
would
get
that
far
if...
if
practice
is
of
any
guidance.
i
would
prefer
to,
if
i
might,
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
i
want
to
respond
only
to
the
issue
of
this
so-called
inability
of
the
court,
under
powell,
to
look
at
the
merits
in
determining
whether
a
proper
purpose
is
had
by
the
internal
revenue
service.
it
seems
to
me
that
powell
said
that
the
hearing
on
proper
purpose
ought
not
to
be
a
meaningless
inquiry.
and
it
is
a
meaningless
inquiry
if
you
can't
look
at
the
merits
or
you
have
a
state
court's
determination
intervening.
because,
in
such
an
instance,
the
only
way
that
you
can
judge
whether
the
internal
revenue
service
is
doing
the
right
thing
is
by
finding
out
what
they're
about.
and
in
this
case,
they
made
it
very
clear.
they
said
they
were
entitled
under
bosch
to
make
a
second
inquiry;
that
they
could
look...
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
they
started
the
case,
they
said
that
it
isn't
determined
under
state
law
at
all...
alone,
it's
determined
under
federal
standards,
as
well.
they
only
abandoned
that
position,
shall
we
say,
artfully,
anyway,
in
the
second
circuit
and
in
this
court.
but,
in
fact,
what
they
would
have
this
court
do
is
impose
a
federal
standard
on
the
surrogate
courts
and,
in
effect,
on
the
parties.
and
what
happens
if
you
don't
find
out
in
the
beginning
whether
they
really
are
interested
in
fraud
and
whether,
as
they
said
in
this
case,
the
only
thing
they
thought
they
could
do
is
second
guess
the
determination
of
this
surrogate.
you
are
not
following
the
line
of
the
powell
case,
in
which
the
court
said
that
the
hearing
cannot
be
meaningless.
and
it
is
meaningless
unless
you
look
into
the
merits
of
the
controversy.
if
we
pick
up
on
the
hypothetical,
suppose
we
had
a
california
case
in
which
the
executor's
commission
and
the
attorney's
fee
are
exactly
the
same.
if
the
court
couldn't
inquire
into
whether
or
not
a
proper
purpose
was
had
by
virtue
of
the
internal
revenue
service
issuing
a
summons
in
that
case,
then
the
inquiry
would,
indeed,
be
a
meaningless
one.
mr.
kenneth
a.
payment
thank
you,
your
honor.
