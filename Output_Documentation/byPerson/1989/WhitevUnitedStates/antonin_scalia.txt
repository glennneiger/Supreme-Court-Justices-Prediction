oh,
so
it's
looking
for
something
else.
justice
scalia
it's
looking
for
something
else.
that's...
that...
that's
why
it
checks
one
out
of
every
hundred.
in
one
out
of
every
hundred
it
might
uncover
an
enormous
discrepancy
between
the
amount
of
the
fee
allowed
and
the...
and
the...
the
hours
actually
expended,
as
shown
by
the
time
sheets.
justice
scalia
in
which
case,
it
would
investigate
further
to
see
if
there
is
any
evidence
of
fraud--
justice
scalia
and
i
suppose
you
would
say
that...
that
even
if
the
service
is
wrong
about
whether
it
has
to
accept
the...
the
finding
of
the
probate
court,
even
if
you're
wrong
about
that,
even
if
it
is
ultimately
held
that
you
have
to
accept
it,
at
least
at
this
point
that's
not
clear,
and
you're
not
in
bad
faith
to
assume
the
contrary?
justice
scalia
--you
would
not
have
a
proper
purpose
in
the
next
case
if
we
came
out
that
way
in
this
case?
justice
scalia
that's...
but
you
would
say
that,
as
far
as
this
case
is
concerned,
having
an
arguable
position
on
this,
your...
your
purpose
is...
is--
justice
scalia
--well,
no.
no,
you
don't.
justice
scalia
which
one?
