justice
blackmun
what
is
there,
an...
an
ambitious
revenue
agent
up
there,
who
wants
to
make
a
quota
or
something?
justice
blackmun
in
competition
with
the
income
tax
people,
who
would
pick
it
up
on
the
other
side
of
the
coin?
justice
blackmun
not
only
allowable,
but
allowed?
justice
blackmun
i
will
say,
in
my
day,
when
i
practiced
a
little
tax
law,
this
thing
was
just
completely
unheard
of.
justice
blackmun
mr.
pay...
payment,
the
deficiency
has
been
paid,
hasn't
it?
justice
blackmun
are
you
taking
the
position
that
this
aspect
of
this
case,
the
summons
aspect,
is
moot?
justice
blackmun
why
isn't
it?
justice
blackmun
why
isn't
it
moot?
justice
blackmun
wouldn't
you
welcome--
justice
blackmun
--wouldn't
you
welcome
a
holding
to
mootness
here?
justice
blackmun
well,
you'll
do
that--
justice
blackmun
--you'll
do
that
on
the
case
that's
pending
out
there.
justice
blackmun
what
was
the
size--
justice
blackmun
--what
was
the
size
of
the
estate?
what's
the
bottom
line
of
the
size
of
the
estate?
justice
blackmun
which
was
in...
which
was
in
line
with
a
bar
schedule
for
an
estate
of
that
size?
justice
blackmun
is
the
executor's
commission
also
questioned
here?
justice
blackmun
because
it's
fixed
by
statute?
justice
blackmun
how
did--
justice
blackmun
--how
did
the
two
fees
compare
in
size?
the
attorney's
fee
was
how
much?
justice
blackmun
so
he
got
a
double
fee,
though?
justice
blackmun
yes,
but
you
have
the
tax?
justice
blackmun
mr.
horowitz,
what
is
the
government
really
after
here?
are
you
biting
off
your
nose
to
save
your
face,
so
to
speak?
might
you
not
get
a
lot
more
taxes
on
the
income
tax
end
of
it
than
on
the
estate
tax
end
of
it
in
the
long
run?
justice
blackmun
well,
usually,
i
think
that's
the
case,
is
it
not?
justice
blackmun
that
why
i
think
you
have
an
agent
up
there
working
on
a
quota.
justice
blackmun
exactly.
that's
why
i
wonder
why
you're
making
such
a
fuss
over
it.
justice
blackmun
yes,
but
you
issued...
you
issued
the
summons?
justice
blackmun
and
it
may
well
be
misguided--
justice
blackmun
--the
irs
may
lose
a
lot
more
taxes
doing
this
than
they
would
if
they
let
it
go
to
the
income
tax
aspect.
justice
blackmun
is
your
next
step
along
the
line
of
justice
o'connor's
question?
are
you
going
to
question
claims
that
have
been
allowed
in
every
probate
in
new
york?
justice
blackmun
--well,
that's
rather--
justice
blackmun
--that's
rather
a
broad
statement,
mr.
horowitz.
you
don't
probate
in
an
estate
of
this
size
in
a
half-an-hour's
work,
do
you?
have
you
ever
probated
an
estate?
justice
blackmun
no.
justice
blackmun
mr.
horowitz,
don't
misunderstand
me,
i'm
frank
to
say
i've
never
liked
double
fees,
and
i've
never
liked
double
fees
that
are
fixed
at
the
maximum
possible.
but
i
just
wonder
if
the
irs
hasn't
gone
a
little
too
far
here.
justice
blackmun
well,
i'm
sure--
justice
blackmun
--i'm
sure
some
fee
is
allowable
in
an
estate
of
this
size?
justice
blackmun
and
the--
justice
blackmun
--and
the
surrogate
not
only
found
it
allowable,
he
allowed
it.
