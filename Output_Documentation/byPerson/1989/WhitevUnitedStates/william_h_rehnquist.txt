chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
88-928,
james
m.
white
versus
the
united
states.
we'll
wait,
just
a
minute,
mr.
payment,
until
the
court
clears.
very
well,
mr.
payment,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
payment,
when
you...
you
use
the
term
"collateral
attack",
that
isn't
strictly
correct,
is
it?
because
the
government
wasn't
a
party
to
the
case
in
which
the
attorney's
fees
were...
were...
were
allowed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
think
of
a
collateral
attack
as
being
a
challenge
to
a
final
judgment
by
someone
who...
who
is
bound
by
the
judgment,
by
someone
who
is
a
party
to
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
government
disallowed
the
entire
attorney's
fee
in
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--was
any
reason
given
for
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--it's
your--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--it's
your
position,
then,
that
if...
if
the
practice
in
the
surrogate
in
monroe
county
is
to
just
barely
give
a
nod
to
time,
that
the...
and
that's
supported
by
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
decision--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--that
the
internal
revenue
service
must
analyze
in
the
same
way?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
would
hope
so,
yeah.
chief
justice
rehnquist
was
mr.
white
both
executor
and
attorney?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
payment.
mr.
horowitz.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the...
the
disallowance,
then,
did
depend
on
the
refusal
to
obey
the
summons?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
it
would
be
hard
to
say,
though,
that
the
summons
enforcement
proceeding
was
moot,
so
long
as
the
entire
refund
proceeding
has
been
necessitated
by
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you...
you...
you...
you're...
the
irs'
position
is
that
the
surrogate
in
monroe
county
is
not
following
the
freeman
decision?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
i...
i
thought
you
said
that
you're
investigating
to
see
if...
if--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
where
did
the
concern
come
from?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what...
what--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
okay.
but
what
if
new
york
law
says
that
someone
who
is
both
executor
and
attorney
for
the
estate
shall
be
entitled
to
a
fee
equal
to
10
percent
of
the
gross
estate?
does--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--but
you...
you
feel
the
new
york
law
is
different,
that
it
requires
a
certain
expenditure
of
time
in
order
to
warrant
any
fee?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and...
and
your
position
is
the
irs
need
say
nothing
more
in
a
case
like
this
than
it
wishes
to
look
into
the
propriety
of
the
award
of
attorney's
fees.
it
doesn't
have
to
say
why
it
wants
to
or
what
it
thinks
may
be
bad
about
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
some...
somewhere
in...
somewhere
in
the
briefs
or
record,
mr.
horowitz,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
something
to
the
effect
that
one
of
the
concerns
of
the
i...
irs
was
that
new
york
allowed
the
attorney
to...
to
also
be
the
executor.
am
i
right
in
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that...
that...
that's...
that
really
seems
quite
dubious
to
me.
i
mean,
if
new
york
law
allows--
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
certainly
can
say
there
is
a
reason,
suggested
by
justice
stevens'
question
that,
in
bosch,
there
was
a
motive
on
the
part
of
all
the
parties
to
the
litigation
to
have
it
come
out
a
particular
way,
in
order
to
reduce
their
tax
liability.
here
there
is
a
motive
on
the
part
of
the
beneficiaries
not
to
want
to
pay
any
larger
estate
attorney's
fee
or
executor's
commission
than
was
required
by
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
certainly
a
factual
difference
from
bosch.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
don't
find
the
bosch
majority,
in
particularly,
crystal
clear
as
to
what
the
rule
is
or
why
it's
that
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
horowitz.
mr.
payment,
you
have
rebuttal.
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
payment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
88-928,
james
white
versus
the
united
states.
the
writ
of
certiorari
has
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
justice
white
dissents.
