justice
kennedy
well,
as
a
standard
reason,
the
failure
to
obey
the
subpoena.
justice
kennedy
i'm...
i'm
still
not
sure
how
you
answered
justice
stevens'
question
that
i
was
interested
in.
which
is,
suppose
the
irs
just
says
we're
going
to
have
a...
a
routine
audit
of
every
hundredth
return.
and
we're
going
to
go
into
it
from
top
to
bottom.
what...
what
is
the
rule
that
you
wish
us
to
promulgate
that
says
they
can't
do
that?
justice
kennedy
well,
in
that
case,
cannot
the
government
subpoena
the
time
records
in
the
refund
case?
justice
kennedy
well,
why
doesn't
that
make
the
case
moot,
then?
they're
going
to
get
the
material
anyway.
justice
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
why
that...
that
follows,
if
the
refund
suit
is
still
pending.
justice
kennedy
my...
my
notes
show
that
the
executor's
commission
was
reduced
also
from
$17,450
to
16,804;
is
that
incorrect?
justice
kennedy
so
the...
so
the
agent
in
this
case
did
reduce
the
executor's
commission
as
well?
justice
kennedy
well,
i...
i
suppose
they
might
if
they
were
in
disagreement.
justice
kennedy
well,
can
you
use
the
discovery
proceedings
in
the
refund
suit
to
get
the
documents?
