justice
o'connor
mr.
payment,
has
this
so-called
attack
occurred
only
in
one
area
of
the
country,
or
is
this
a
nationwide
effort?
justice
o'connor
but,
thus
far,
just
in
new
york?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
this
comes
up
in
the
context
of
a
summons
enforcement
proceeding,
right?
justice
o'connor
which
complicates
it
somewhat,
because
the
court
has
been
careful
not
to
trench
upon
the
summons
enforcement
power
of
the
irs.
justice
o'connor
that's
right.
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
so,
presumably,
the
irs
could
legitimately
seek
information
by...
by
way
of
the
summons
enforcement
technique?
justice
o'connor
so,
for
you
to
win,
you
have
to
persuade
us
that
bosch
was
perhaps...
went
too
far,
or
we
need
to
cut
back
on
it
or
something?
justice
o'connor
for
you
to
win?
justice
o'connor
you
don't
rely
on
any
argument
that
the
irs
has
acted
in
bad
faith,
i
gather?
justice
o'connor
what
if
there
were
fraud
or
the
state
court
had
applied
state
law
erroneously
in
allowing
the
fee?
justice
o'connor
but
i
guess
if
we
conclude
that
under
united
states
v.
powell,
that
you
didn't
make
a
showing
of
bad
faith
by
the
irs,
we
don't
reach
any
further
question?
justice
o'connor
mr.
horowitz,
is
the
internal
revenue
service,
in
fact,
starting
some
effort
to
review,
generally,
claims
as
allowed
by
state
courts
in
estates?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
there
just
some
particular
agent
in
new
york
that's
on
a
roll,
so
to
speak?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you...
do
you
think
that...
that
the
statutes,
section
2053,
generally
suggests,
anyway,
that
the
internal
revenue
service
will
accept
the
fees
that
are
awarded
by
the
state
courts?
