justice
stevens
mr.
payment,
may
i
interrupt?
because
i...
i
have
some
trouble
with
this
argument,
because
in
lots
of
tax
enforcement,
the
internal
revenue
doesn't
have
any
suspicion
of
fraud,
but
they'll
just
make
random...
take
one
out
of
every
100
returns
and...
and
investigate
them
very
thoroughly,
and
sometimes
they'll
stumble
on
fraud.
justice
stevens
could
they
do
this
in
the
attorney
fee
area...
just
not
necessarily
have
to
allege
fraud,
but
just
say
as
our
routine
enforcement,
we
check
up
on
every
15th
fee...
fee
award?
justice
stevens
well,
but
the
other
side
of
the
coin
here
is
it's...
it's
not
all
that
burdensome
to
turn
over
your
time
sheets,
either.
justice
stevens
well,
he
has
to
do--
justice
stevens
--but
whatever
records
are...
are
sufficient
to
justify
the
fee
for
the
probate
court,
or
whatever
you
call
the
judge,
you
used
to
have
to
turn
over
those
same
records
to
the...
to
the
irs.
justice
stevens
were
the
time
sheets
in
the
records?
but
if
the
surrogate
had--
justice
stevens
--but,
if
the
surrogate
had...
if
the
surrogate
had
said
to
you,
i'd
like
to
take
a
look
at
your
time
sheets,
you
wouldn't
have
any
doubt
that
you'd
have
to
turn
them
over
to
him,
would
you?
justice
stevens
and
he
wouldn't
have
to
say,
i
suspect
you
of
fraud,
i
just
think,
every
now
and
then,
i
ought
to...
ought
to
find
out
just
how
much
time
goes
into
these
for...
for
general
information.
justice
stevens
but,
really,
what
you're
saying
is
that
if
you
turn
over
the
records
and
the
irs
challenged
them,
that
a
fee
is
not
being
a...
allowable
as
a
matter
of
new
york
law,
you
would
win?
that's
really
what
you're
saying,
i
think,
in
final
analysis?
justice
stevens
then
irs--
justice
stevens
--then
irs
must
make
an
eyeball
judgment,
too.
justice
stevens
are
there
any
cases
in
which
you've
litigated
out
the
merits
of
a
fee
award
in
your...
your
county?
justice
stevens
with
the
irs,
i
mean?
justice
stevens
i
understand
you
probably
settle
them;
it's
a
lot
easier
to
settle...
to
take...
knock
a
thousand
dollars
off
the
fee
and
save
the
expense.
but
have
you
ever
had
a
test
case
on
whether
they
have
actually
overreached
in
trying
to
disallow
deductions
for
a
fee?
justice
stevens
but
under
your
rule,
could
they
do
it
if
it
was
90
percent
of
the
estate?
justice
stevens
what--
justice
stevens
--well,
supposing
you
had
findings
by
the
trial
judge
that
this
was
a
complicated
estate,
and
i
know
from
similar
complicated
estates
it
takes
a
great
deal
of
time
and
effort,
and
i
think
it's
an
awful
lot
of
money,
but
in
this
particular
case,
it's
perfectly
reasonable
to
give
them
90
percent
of
the
estate?
justice
stevens
so--
justice
stevens
--i
would
suspect
you
can
never
go
behind
a
state
court
judgment.
then
that's
really
what
you're
saying,
then?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
don't
we
also
have
to
presume
that
if
you
turned
over
the
records
and
they
disallowed
the
fee,
you'd
say
i'm
going
to
stick
to
my
guns
because
i've
got
a
court
order
approving
it,
and
if
we
litigate
it
out,
you're
going
to
lose?
justice
stevens
don't
we
have
to
presume
you
would
win
the
lawsuit
on
the
validity
of
the
deduction?
justice
stevens
yeah.
maybe
not
this
one,
because
this
is
kind
of
peculiar.
he
didn't
comply
with
the
subpoena.
justice
stevens
but...
but
in
the
normal
case
where
you
comply
with
the
subpoena
and
you've
got
a
court
order
approving
your
fee,
aren't
you
going
to
win
99
percent
of
those
cases?
justice
stevens
no
they
don't.
justice
stevens
but...
i...
i
grant
all
that,
but
don't
you
think
that
if
you
assume
an
neutral
tribunal
in
which
the
issue
is
litigated
out,
you
think
there's
a
danger
of
losing
these
cases?
justice
stevens
well,
isn't
that...
you
think
the...
the
federal
court
is
not
a
neutral
tribunal?
justice
stevens
well,
i
understand
that.
justice
stevens
well,
it
really
relates
to
the
first
issue,
though,
because
if
we
construe
the
statute
to
mean,
in
effect,
that
anything
that's
been
allowed
by
the
state
judge
is
deductible,
then
you
would
not
have
a
proper
purpose.
justice
stevens
i
thought
that
was
your
hypothetical
earlier?
isn't
that
the
same--
justice
stevens
well,
the
bosch
is
a
case
where
you
basically
had
a
collusive
suit;
everybody
was
interested
in
reducing
taxes
there.
i
mean,
there...
there
were
no
adversary
parties
that...
that
wanted...
here,
there
at
least
are
beneficiaries
who--
justice
stevens
--presumably
don't
want
to
pay
a
larger
fee
than
they
have
to.
justice
stevens
bosch
is
quite
different,
i
think.
justice
stevens
but,
in
fact,
that
was
true.
they
were
construing,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
whether
it
was...
i
forget
now...
marital
deduction
or
something.
but
no...
none
of
the...
none
of
the
parties
stood
to...
to
gain
anything
except
tax
savings
by
the
decree.
justice
stevens
well,
that's
not
the
case
here.
