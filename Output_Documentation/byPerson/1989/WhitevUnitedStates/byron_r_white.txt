justice
white
well,
do
you...
do
you
think
that...
do
you
think
that
the
irs
may
inquire
as
to
whether
a
surrogate's
decision
is
consistent
with
state
law?
justice
white
well,
you
shouldn't...
if
you
know
that
the
decision
is
consistent
with
state
law,
that
may
be
so,
but
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
every
surrogate's
decision
is
consistent
with
state
law?
justice
white
well,
suppose
the
internal
revenue
code
says
what
the
surrogate
did
is...
is
wholly
contrary
to
a...
a
decision
of
the
court
of
the
appeals
in
new
york?
justice
white
and
you
say
they
cannot
do
that?
justice
white
well,
state
law
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
say
it
is,
not
what
a
surrogate
says
it
is.
justice
white
well,
they've...
they've
got...
the
irs,
i
would
think,
should
be
able
to
inquire
as
to
whether
what
he
did
is
consistent
with
freeman.
justice
white
i
would
like
to--
[inaudible]
you
mean,
you
can
just
allege
a
mathematical
error...
the
irs
can...
and
get
behind
the
surrogate's
judgment?
justice
white
well,
could
you
have
a
summons
enforcement
just
to
determine
there's
no
mathematical
error?
justice
white
xxx
as
i
gather
from
your
brief,
you
say
that
the...
the
service
doesn't
know
whether
there
might
be
fraud?
justice
white
and--
justice
white
--and
that
might
be
true
even
if
the
statute
said
10
percent?
justice
white
that
may
be
so.
