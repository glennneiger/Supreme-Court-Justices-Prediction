chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
89-645,
michael
milkovich
v.
the
lorain
journal
company.
mr.
english,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--is
this...
is
this
is...
is
this
your
primary
submission,
mr.
english,
or
is
your
primary
submission
that
there
really
is
no...
no
need
for
a
separate
first
amendment
privilege
for
opinion?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
english.
mr.
panza,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
which
opinion,
mr.
panza?
chief
justice
rehnquist
no.
which
of
the
opinion
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
as
i
recall
reading
the
scott
case
[inaudible],
there
wasn't
just
one
opinion,
there
were
a
number
of
different
opinions
by
the
justices
of
the
supreme
court
of
ohio.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
majority
opinion?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
supposing
in
this
case
mr.
diadiun
had
said,
in
my
opinion
milkovich
perjured
himself.
do
you
think
that
should
be
actionable
if
it
can
be
proved
false?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
can
you
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
don't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i'm...
i'm
asking
you
hypothetical
question,
mr.
panza,
that
doesn't
necessarily
depend
on
the
article.
do
you
want
me
to
repeat
my
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
he
said,
in
my
opinion
milkovich
committed
perjury,
is
that...
should
that
be...
should
there
be
no
action
because
the
first
amendment...
even
if...
even
if
milkovich
cannot
prove
he
did
not
commit
perjury?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
answer...
can
you
answer
my
question
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
should
be
protected?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
shouldn't
that
be
a
jury
question?
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say...
when
you
say
if
the
reader
perceives
it
as
opinion,
is
that
a
question
that
a...
that
a
court
decides
without...
as
a
matter
of
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
mean,
why
shouldn't
it
be
a
question
of
fact
if
you're
talking
about
the
perception
of
a
reader?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so...
so
the
question
of
how
this...
how
the
statement
is
perceived
is
not
a
question
of
fact,
but
it's
a
question
of
law
that's
decided
by
the
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
how...
how
does
the
court
go
about
deciding
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
it...
it's
one
thing
to
say
he
never
said
it,
and
it's
another
thing
to
say...
to
say
that
he
said
it,
that
was
taken
out
of
context.
do
you
mean
literally
he
never
said
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
not
saying
he
committed
perjury.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are...
are
you
seeking
to
distinguish
between
an
acquisition
that
someone
is
a
perjurer
and
someone
is
a
child
abuser?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
the
speaker
goes
on,
or
the
writer
goes
on
for
10
or
12
column
inches,
isn't
it
conceivable
he
may
be
saying
several
different
things?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
might
not
one
of
them
in
this
case
be
that
mr.
milkovich
perjured
himself?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
can't
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
in
a
sports
column,
unless
you
really
mean
to
say
that
someone
perjured
themselves,
it...
it's
okay?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
panza.
mr.
english,
you
have
12
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
did...
it
did
come
out
a
different
way
in
scott
on
some
issues
than
it
did
in
the
milkovich
case,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
english,
unless
there
are
further
questions
from
the
court
on
that
point,
i
think...
i
think
you
can
consider
that
we...
we
have
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
english.
the
case
is
submitted.
