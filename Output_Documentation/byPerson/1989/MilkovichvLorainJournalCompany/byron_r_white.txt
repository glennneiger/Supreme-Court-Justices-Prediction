yeah,
but
hepps...
in
hepps
you
still
have
to...
before
you
give
the
jury...
before
you...
before
a
plaintiff
can
undertake
to
prove
something
is
false
it
has
to
be
provable,
i
guess.
justice
white
so...
so
you
really
don't
solve
much.
you
still
have
to
figure
out
whether
something
is
verifiable.
justice
white
well,
then--
justice
white
--well,
then,
if
it
isn't
verifiable,
it's
opinion.
so
you
get...
so
you
end
up
with
the
same--
justice
white
--the
same
result.
justice
white
xxx
says
that
everyone
knows
in
his
heart,
that
includes
the
speaker.
justice
white
that
includes
the
person.
justice
white
so
that...
that
general
statement
subsumes
a
statement
that
i
think
he
lied.
justice
white
so
the
statement
that
you're
relying
on
is...
is
the
portion
of
it
which
in
substance
says,
i,
the
author,
know
he
lied.
justice
white
well,
there
might
be
a
constitutional
rule
in
the
state
protecting
this
sort
of
thing,
but
if
the
state
just
follows
the
federal
rule
in
applying...
in
construing
its
own
constitution,
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
an
adequate
independent
state
ground.
justice
white
is
there
any
case
precedent
in
the
state
of
ohio
which
undertakes
to
analyze
defamation
issues
separately
under
state
law
and
reject
contrary
to
result
to
what
the
federal
law
reaches?
justice
white
we
couldn't
decide
it
for
the...
under
the...
we
couldn't
decide
what
the
ohio
constitution
requires
or
not.
justice
white
but
do
you
think
that's
the
test
rather
than
verifiability?
