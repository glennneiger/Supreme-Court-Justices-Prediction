justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
on
that
point,
mr.
english,
you
say
it's
quintessentially
a
question
of
fact,
but
isn't
it
obvious
that
the
author
of
the
statement
could
not
possibly
know
as
a
matter
of
fact
what
everyone
who
attended
the
meet
knew
in
his
heart?
i
mean,
isn't
this
like
saying
that
i
was
at
the
meet,
and
i
talked
to
a
lot
of
people
and
it's
my
opinion
that
everyone
at
the
meet
must
have
had
the
same
view
that
i
had?
justice
stevens
you
think
he
saying
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
knows
that
everyone
there
knew
in
his
heart
that
he...
he--
justice
stevens
--that's
verifiable.
justice
stevens
well,
there
are
two
different
things
i'm
suggesting.
one
is
the
difference
between
saying
the
man
lied
under
oath,
and
the
second
statement
is
that
the
third
party
who
was
at
the
meet
knows
he
lied
under
oath.
justice
stevens
as
to...
that's...
the
latter
half,
was
that
fact
or
opinion?
justice
stevens
well,
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
it
depends
on
how...
it
was
written
in
english,
i
guess.
[laughter]
justice
stevens
and
you...
you
can
disregard
the
fact
that
everyone
else
thought
he
lied.
justice
stevens
oh,
i...
i
thought
you
said
the
opposite.
i
think
you
did
say
the
opposite.
yeah,
you
had
me
going
there.
justice
stevens
supposing
he
said
this,
i
attended
the
meeting
and
i
saw
these
facts
and
i
saw...
then
somebody
else
told
me
these
facts;
on
the
basis
of
these
facts,
i
think
he
lied?
justice
stevens
well,
what...
what
do
you
do
with
that
case?
he
sets
out
all
the
facts
on
which
he
bases
the
opinion
and
then
he
expresses...
he
says,
i
think
he
lied
deliberately
and
committed
perjury,
which
is
a
felony
in
ohio,
and
my
reason
for
saying
that
is
a,
b,
c
and
d,
which
are
all...
a,
b,
c
and
d
are
all
accurate.
actionable
or
not?
justice
stevens
mr.
panza--
justice
stevens
--mr.
panza,
would
you
help
me
on
one
matter.
i
can't
find
it
right
now,
there's
so
darned
many
opinions
in
these
two
volumes
here,
i
can't
find
it.
but
the
scott
supreme
opinion...
maybe
you'll
give
me
the
page
of
it
if
it's
handy...
but
the
syllabus
of
the
scott
opinion,
as
i
remember
it,
does
not
differentiate
between
the
federal
and
the
state
constitution.
justice
stevens
and
isn't
it
the
syllabus
that's
the
law
in
ohio,
rather
than
the
opinion?
justice
stevens
so
if
the
syllabus
does
not
contain
an
independent
adequate
statement
they're
relying
on
a
state
ground
rather
than
federal,
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
ball
game?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
there
is--
justice
stevens
--all
right.
could...
could
you
tell
me
which
is
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
we're
reviewing
here
in
your
appendix?
in
the
joint
appendix?
just
give
me
a
page.
justice
stevens
108.
thank
you.
justice
stevens
okay.
may
i
give
you
a
hard
hypothetical?
supposing
in
this
case
the
fact
of
the
matter
was
that
mr.
milkovich
never
even
testified
at
the
hearing
and
that
the
author
of
the
article
knew
that
and
nevertheless
wrote
the
same
article?
justice
stevens
well,
just
under--
justice
stevens
--under
the
actual
malice
standard
he
knew
the
statement
was
false
when
he
made
it.
that's
all.
justice
stevens
but...
but
that
would
be
irrelevant?
but
it...
it's
so
clearly
provable
that
he...
that
he
did
make...
you'd
still
say
that
protected
in
my
hypothetical,
in
other
words?
justice
stevens
yeah.
could
i
ask
you
another--
