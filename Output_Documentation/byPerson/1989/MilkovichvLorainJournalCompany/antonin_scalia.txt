justice
scalia
is
the...
is
the
only
language
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
used
in
long
that...
that
justifies
the
assertion
of
independent
state
grounds
the
phrase
that
the
ideals
of
the
first
amendment
are
independently
reinforced
in
section
11,
article
i
of
the
ohio...
is
there--
justice
scalia
would
it
be
libelous
if
he'd
said,
i
believe
he
lied?
justice
scalia
wait.
i'm
sorry.
you
said--
--and
you'd
agreed
with
that?
--it
would
be
libelous
or
it
wouldn't
be
libelous
if
he
said
i
believe
he
lied?
justice
scalia
but
you
can't
avoid
it
by
saying
in
my
opinion
he
is
a
liar?
i
mean,
that's
the
same
thing
as
saying
he
is
a
liar.
justice
scalia
you
don't
agree
with
the
restatement
second?
justice
scalia
you
have
to
right
not
only
about
the
facts,
but
also
about
the
assessment
of
the
facts--
justice
scalia
--unless
you
can...
and
the
burden's
on
you.
but
if
you
can
prove
to
a
jury
that
that
assessment
of
the
facts
is...
is
not
correct,
it's
libel.
justice
scalia
but
that's
not
the
case
we
have
before
us.
justice
scalia
that
isn't...
that
isn't
the
opinion
that
is...
that
is
on
appeal
here.
justice
scalia
well,
we...
we
don't
make
an
independent
inquiry
into
state
law
whenever
we're
reviewing
the
judgment
of
a
state
court
to
determine
whether
even
though
this
state
judge
didn't
rely
on
state
law,
he
could
have--
justice
scalia
--because,
in
fact,
it
is
a
matter
of
state
law.
and
that's
what
you're...
isn't
that
what
you're
arguing
about?
justice
scalia
i
don't
care
what
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
cited.
i
care
what
the
opinion
of
the
court--
justice
scalia
--what
did
the
court
of
appeal
say?
it
cited
federal
cases--
justice
scalia
--it
cited
federal
cases
and
scott.
is
that
right?
it
cited
both
federal
cases
and
scott.
and
while
scott
also
relied
on
a
state
ground,
scott
also
relied
on
a
federal
ground,
didn't
it?
justice
scalia
well,
but
that...
that's
a
very
handy
device.
i
assume
that
all
book
publishers
can
just
put
on
the
first
page
everything
contained
in
this
book
is,
of
course,
the
opinion
of
the
writer.
and
then
you
can
go
on
and
say
anything
you
like.
justice
scalia
and
there's
no
liability
for
libel
at
all.
and
all
newspapers
can
have
on
their
masthead,
everything
here
is
the
opinion
of
the
people
who
write
it.
justice
scalia
and
there's
no
such
thing
as
libel.
justice
scalia
i
thought
you
were.
justice
scalia
in
your
response
to
the--
justice
scalia
--to
the
chief--
justice
scalia
mr.
panza,
let
me...
let
me
understand
your
position.
it
is
perfectly
all
right,
i
take
it,
if
i
say,
in
my
opinion
so
and
so
is
a
child
abuser;
i
don't
have
a
whole
lot
of
facts
to
go
on
but
that's
my
opinion.
i
can
say
that
and
that
is
not
libelous?
justice
scalia
oh,
the
difference
is
between
calling
someone
a...
a
child
abuser
and
a
perjurer?
is
that...
we're
going
to--
justice
scalia
--different
classifications
of...
of
libel?
justice
scalia
it...
it
would
be
all
right?
i
mean,
that
was
just...
that
was
just
a
lead
in.
justice
scalia
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
for
sure
yes
to
that.
justice
scalia
that
wasn't
a
real
question.
[laughter]
i'm
getting
to
the
real
question.
i
assume
if
you
can
say
that,
you
can
also
say...
if
you
can
prove
it
to
be
true...
90
percent
of
the
people
in
his
office
think
that
he's
a
child
abuser.
so
long
as
you
can
prove
that
it
is
indeed
the
fact
that
is
the
opinion
of
90
percent
of
the
people
in
his
office
that
he's
a
child
abuser,
i
assume
that
you
could
say
that
as
well.
justice
scalia
doesn't
it
trouble
you
that
people's
reputations
without
any
ability
to
defend
it
can
be
destroyed
this
way?
justice
scalia
well,
what's
your
solution?
justice
scalia
your
answer
to
my
question
is,
yes,
you
could
publish
in
your
paper
90
percent
of
the
teachers
in
so
and
so
school
think
that
he's
a
child
abuser
and
that
is
not
libelous?
justice
scalia
--your
response
earlier
to
justice
kennedy
and
me
said
that...
the...
suggested
that
the
fact/opinion
dichotomy
only
applies
if
it's
a
matter
of...
of
public
concern.
i...
i
hadn't
understood
your
position
to
be
that.
i
thought
that
the...
and
the
courts
that
have
applied
that
reasoning,
i
thought
they
apply
it
to
all...
all
defamation
actions,
not
just
those
that
relate
to
matters
of
public
concern.
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
scalia
right.
so
if
i
said
somebody
was...
in
my
opinion
he's
a
lousy
carpenter,
that...
that
would
also
be
immune
because
he--
justice
scalia
--let's
see
what
this
proves.
it
proves
that
you
want
to
get
to
the
truth.
and
the
issue
is
whether
you're
likely
to
get
to
the
truth
in
a
society
when
you
allow
the
most
outrageous
version
of
things
to
be
published
so
long
as
it's
somebody's
opinion.
do
you
really
think
that
it's
going
to
help
the
search
for
truth
to
allow
the
most
false
things
to
be
said
so
long
as
they're
said
as
opinions
without
any
recourse?
