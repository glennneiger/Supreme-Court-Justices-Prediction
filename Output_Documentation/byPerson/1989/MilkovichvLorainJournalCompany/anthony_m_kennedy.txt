justice
kennedy
so...
so
you
would...
would
accept
as
a
definition
of
opinion
is
something
that
cannot
be
proven
true
or
false?
justice
kennedy
is
there...
are
there
any
indication
on
the
ohio
cases
that
state
law
and
first
amendment
federal
constitutional
law
are
one
and
the
same
so
far
as
the
definition
of
opinion?
justice
kennedy
i
mean,
how...
not...
not,
pre-new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
i
assume?
justice
kennedy
and
suppose
that
the
words,
"in
my
opinion",
were
left
out?
he
just
says,
mr.
milkovich
lied
under
oath?
justice
kennedy
and
that
would
be
actionable
in
your
view?
justice
kennedy
do
you...
do
you
then--
justice
kennedy
--is
it...
is
it
good
reporting,
therefore,
to...
in
your
view...
under
your
view
of
the
case,
to
preface
statements
of
fact
with
the
words
"in
my
opinion"
in
order
to
immunize
yourself--
justice
kennedy
--from
responsibility?
justice
kennedy
so
that
would
be
bad
reporting?
justice
kennedy
--well,
then,
you're
qualifying
the
answer
you
gave
to
the
chief
justice
earlier?
justice
kennedy
i
mean,
it's
not
clear--
justice
kennedy
--to
me
what
your
position
is.
so
suppose
that's
all
the
statement.
it's
just
the
one
sentence
in
the
big
headline,
in
my
view,
in
my
opinion,
milkovich
committed
perjury.
that's
all.
justice
kennedy
you're...
you're...
you're
suggesting
to
us
that
we
have
different
categories
of
subjects,
some
of
which
are
protected
and
some
of
which
are
not?
that's
the
position
of
your
newspaper?
justice
kennedy
well,
this....
justice
kennedy
this
man...
this
man
was
an
educator.
i...
i
would
think
that
justice
scalia's
hypothetical...
if
a
statement
like
that
had
been
made
by
an
educator,
i
can
hear
some
newspaper
arguing
that
this
is
very,
very
relevant
for
social
purposes.
justice
kennedy
i
gave
up
reading
the
sport
column
because
it
had
nothing
but
legal
news,
antitrust,
contract
breach--
[laughter]
justice
kennedy
is
that
an
issue
that's
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
perception
of
the
average
reader?
or
is
that
for
the
court--
