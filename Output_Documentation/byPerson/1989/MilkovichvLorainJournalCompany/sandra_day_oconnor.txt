justice
o'connor
mr.
english,
do
you
think
that
this
case
involves
a
matter
of
public
concern?
justice
o'connor
does
it
fall
under
the
rubric
of
the
hepps
case?
justice
o'connor
and
if
it's...
if
hepps
applies,
then
the
plaintiff
below
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
falsity?
justice
o'connor
and
are
these
statements
capable
of
being
proven
false?
justice
o'connor
if
that's
true,
it
doesn't
much
matter
whether
you
label
it
fact
or
opinion,
does
it?
justice
o'connor
the
question
is
whether
you
can
prove
that
it's
false.
justice
o'connor
mr.
panza,
do
you
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
this
case
is
governed...
falls
within
the
hepps'
holding?
that
it's
speech
about
a
matter
of
public
concern?
justice
o'connor
all
right.
and
why
is
it
that
you
think
that
the
allegation
that
someone
lied
under
oath
isn't
something
that
the
plaintiff
could
try
to
prove
is
false?
it
would
seem
to
me
that's...
that's
a
statement
that
can
be
proven
true
or
false.
justice
o'connor
and
why
shouldn't
we
let
that
go
to
the
jury
and
let
them
have
their
chance?
justice
o'connor
what
if
the
conclusion
of
the
jury
is
that
the
reasonable
average
reader
would
have
understood
this
article
as
saying
the
plaintiff
lied
under
oath?
justice
o'connor
well,
the
plaintiff
says
they're
not
interested
in
the
statement
about
what
other
people
think.
they're
only
interested
in
the
allegation
that
the
plaintiff
lied
under
oath.
justice
o'connor
shouldn't
it
turn
on
what
the
average
reasonable
reader
of
the
article
would
think
was
being
said?
justice
o'connor
yes.
