mr.
richard
d.
panza
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
direct
the
court's
attention
to
what
respondents
initially
believe
to
be
an
improvident
grant
of
the
writ
of
certiorari.
it
is
hard
to
imagine
a...
absent
a
verbatim
recitation
of
the
language
of
michigan
v.
long
a
clearer,
more
precise
statement
of
independent
state
law
than
set
forth
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
the
scott
case.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
scott
case,
1986,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
there
are
only...
your
honor,
the
scott
case
reversed
the
milkovich
case.
pursuant
to
ohio
law,
the
milkovich
case,
as
a
result
of
that
reversal,
has
a
result
of
having
never
having
existed.
it
has
no
legal
effect
whatsoever.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
majority
opinion,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
written
by
judge
locher,
who
was
speaking
for
the
majority.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
richard
d.
panza
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
but
what
was
done
by
the
scott
court,
is
to
find
an
independent
adequate
state
remedy
for--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--your
honor--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--not
at
all,
your
honor.
the
motion
for
summary
judgment...
the
third
motion
for
summary
judgment
cited
scott
for
the
proposition
that
there
was
a
state
constitutional
protection.
and
the
court--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--the
court
of
appeals
said
the
very
same
thing,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
the
court
of...
the
court
of
appeals,
in
citing
the
scott
case,
cited
the
proposition
that
there
is
a...
a
constitutional
protection
for...
for
this
exact
column
pursuant
to
article
i,
section
11
of
the
ohio
constitution.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
your
honor,
i
believe
exactly
that
there
was
a
separate
paragraph
that
the
court
of
appeals
made
citing
article
i,
section
11,
and
then
the
next
paragraph
on
cited
the
gertz
case.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
well,
i
agree
with
you.
it
is
not.
but
that's
not
what
was
done
in
the
scott
case.
in
the
scott
case,
your
honor,
in
the
initial
summary
conclusion
of
the
scott
case
where
the...
the...
the
critical
opinion
is
set
forth
by
the
ohio
supreme
court,
it
holds
quite
clearly,
without
reference
to
the
first
amendment,
that
there
is
a
constitutional
protection
for
opinion
under
article
i,
section
11.
it
then
goes
three
paragraphs
down
and
finds
that
the
ideals
of
free
press
and
free
speech
are
at
the
core
values
of
article
i,
section
11.
and
then
it
uses
the
word
"independently
of"
or
independently
of
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
not
since
the
scott
case,
your
honor,
but
i
might
point
out
to
you
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
one
year
later
in
the
case
of
lansdown
once
again
reiterated
that
the...
there
was
a
constitutional
protection,
a
state
constitutional
protection,
for
opinion
independent
of
the
federal
constitution.
one
year
later.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
doesn't
say
it
either.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
well,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
the
syllabus
doesn't
say...
doesn't
cite
to
the
federal
constitution,
nor
does
it
cite
to
the
ohio--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--supreme
court.
so
you
must
go
into
the
heart
of
opinion
to
try
to
make
a
determination
as
to...
as
to
whether
or
not
there's
independent
adequate
state
grounds.
actually,
you
must
go
into
the
opinion
to
try
and
determine
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
meant
by
making
that
citation.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
but
there
is
no
reference,
one
way
or
another.
you're
quite
correct.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
page
108.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
i'd
like
to
address
myself
now
to
justice
o'connor's
comments
concerning
why
respondent
believes
that
hepps
in
no
way
is
sufficient
to
protect
opinion
if
the
purpose
of
the
protected
speech
is
to
advance
public
debate.
and
i
believe
what
mr.
english
has
been
talking
about
for
15
minutes
is...
is
a
test
known
as
the
verifiability
test.
the
problem
with
the
verifiability
test
and
because,
of
course,
we
know
hepps
doesn't
direct
us
to
any
test
whatsoever...
i'm
not
sure
it
was
intended
to
do
that...
but
implicitly,
by
shifting
the
burden
to
the
plaintiff,
it
necessitates
the
verifiability
test.
the
problem
with
the
verifiability
test
is
that
it
protects
only
speech
which
is
figurative
and
so
hyperbolic
that
it
is
absolutely
false.
this
is
speech
which
does
very
little
to
advance
public
debate.
the
problem
with
the
verifiability
test
is
that
it
tends
to
eliminate
as...
it
tends
to
eliminate
the
vast
body
of
opinion
that
may
be
based
on
certain
facts,
which
may
or
may
not
be...
be
proven
true.
it
is
that...
that
debate,
it
is
that
opinion,
such
as
the
opinion
in
this
case,
that
advances
public
debate.
by
allowing
hepps
to
stand
without
any
other
constitutional
protection
you
are
in
effect
excluding
a
substantial
amount
of
opinion.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
i
don't
think
mr.
diadiun's
intentions
have...
are
relevant.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
yes,
i
can.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
i
will.
if...
if
the
article
can
be
perceived
as
the
opinion
of
the
speaker...
in
this
case
the
opinion--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--i
think
what
you're
asking
me,
your
honor,
if
i'm...
if...
is
if
mr.
diadiun
merely
said,
i
think,
and
then
referred
to
a
certain
set
of
factual
scenarios.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
if
it
is
opinion,
and
if
it
concerns--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--yes,
it
should
be
protected,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
no,
then
that
would
sound
like
a...
an
objective
factual
dissertation
of
the
legal
effect
of
mr.
milkovich's
testimony.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
if
it
was
perceived
as
an
objectionable...
or,
excuse
me,
an
objective
recitation
of
the
facts,
yes.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
that's
not
the
case
here.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
absolutely
not.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
absolutely
not,
and
that's
not
what
was
done
here.
absolutely...
and
that
is
not
good
reporting.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
i
would
absolutely
say
so.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
justice
scalia--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--justice
scalia--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--i'm
not...
i'm
not
a
proponent
of
that.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
not
at
all.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
not
at
all.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
not
at
all.
i
believe
what
is
or
is
not
opinion
has
to
be
analyzed
by
the
context
of
what
was
said,
not
by
two
or
three
or
maybe
four
facts
in
the
statement
upon
which
the
context
is
based.
by
the
entire
context.
i
think
the
restatement
of
tort
second
solves
the
problem
of
saying
i
think,
and
then
going
through
a
recitation
of
facts.
and
i
don't...
and
i
am
not
up
here
asking
the
court
to...
to
agree
that
merely
by
putting
some
mystical
words
"i
think"
and
then
reciting
objective
fact
you
can
protect
all
that
fact.
absolutely
not.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
no,
i'm
not
qualifying
at
all.
i
had
to
be--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--i
couldn't
explain--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--if
the
reader
perceives
that
as
opinion,
then...
then
that
is
protected.
and
to
the
extent
that
it...
that
it
is
engaged
in
public
debate,
it
is
protected.
that
is...
that
is
the
answer
to
the
chief
justice.
or
in...
in--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--absolutely
not.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
yes,
it
is.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
why?
mr.
richard
d.
panza
if
you
will...
i'm...
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
you
allow
a
jury
to
decide
that
question,
you
will
be
promoting
self-censorship
and
not
public
debate.
if,
in
fact,
newspapers
will
be
left
to
the
uncertainty
of
jury
conclusions
in
regards
to
an
analysis
of
whether
or
not
their
opinion
may
contain
certain
facts
which
can
or
cannot
be
proven
true
or
false
out
of
context,
they
won't
write
the
opinion.
and,
as
a
result,
public
debate
will
suffer.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
well,
it
has
to
use
a
test
and
it
has
to
adopt
a
test.
and
there
are
many
tests
that
we
set
forth
in
our
brief.
the
one
we
are
a
proponent
of
is
pretty
much
the
test
used
in
the
scott
court
in
1986.
and
that
is,
the
ollman
test,
as
modified
by
the
seventh
circuit
in
the
potomac
valve
case.
it
takes
into
consideration
the
meaning
of
the
words,
it
takes
into
consideration
whether
or
not
the
particular
factual
assertion
is
verifiable,
if
it
is
a
factual
assertion.
it
takes
into
consideration
the
internal
and
external
context
of
the
entire
opinion.
and
the
entire
opinion
is
important
here,
your
honor,
because
the
speaker,
diadiun,
never
said
mike
milkovich
committed
perjury.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
his
opinion.
it
is
a
statement
totally
taken
out
of
context
which...
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
in
regards
to
verifiability...
doesn't
do
justice
to
his
opinion.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
he
never
said
he
committed
perjury.
what
he
said
was,
i
think,
is
what
mr.
english
read
to
you.
and,
that
is,
everyone
who
was
in
attendance
at
the
meet,
be
he
a
partial
or
impartial
observer,
knows
in
his
heart
that
mr.
milkovich
lied
after
having
given
his
solemn
oath
to
tell
the
truth.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
i
think...
i
think...
i
think
if
you
isolate
that
and
if
you
have
a
lawyer
look
at
it,
he
will
conclude
it
constitutes
perjury.
i
think
if
you
review
that
statement
in
the
entire
context
of
the
article,
you
will
understand
that
it
has
very
little
to
do
with
an
accusation
of
perjury.
your
honor,
i
submit
to
you,
if
ted
diadiun
wanted
to
accuse
michael
milkovich
of
perjury,
he
would
have
published
this
article
after
the
ohsaa
hearing
because,
if
you'll
remember,
in
the
article
he
said
he
believed
that
mr.
milkovich
misrepresented
the
facts
in
that
hearing.
if
he
wanted
to
accuse
him
of
perjury,
your
honor,
i
submit
he
would
have
published
an
article
on
november
9th,
1974
after
he
had
his
conversation
with
harold
meyer
because
it
was
at
that
time
that
he
believed
milkovich
had
lied
under
oath.
the
reason
why
he
waited
two
months
later,
your
honor,
is
because
the
point...
the
very
point
that
mr.
diadiun
is
making
in
the
article,
and
that
is,
educators,
motivators
of
youth
who
refuse
to
accept
responsibility
for
their
action,
that's
what
constitutes
a
lie.
and
if
they
get
away
with
it,
that
sets
a
poor
example
for
the
students
they
teach.
that
is
what
ted
diadiun
is
saying,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
well,
i
can
imagine
that
there
are
scurrilous
forms
of
opinion
that
this
court
may
not
choose
to
extend
constitutional
protection
to.
and
that's
not
my
case.
and
i...
i
can
understand
that.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
no,
no.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
no.
it
still
may
be
opinion,
your
honor.
it
still
may
be
opinion,
but
whether
or
not
you
want
to
extend
constitutional
protection
for
that
particular
form
of
opinion--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--no.
what
i'm...
what
i
am
proposing
to
you,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
since
the
new
york
times
case
you
have
chosen
to
protect
certain
forms
of
speech
which...
which
promote
public
debate.
this
should
be
no
exception
to
that
rule.
that's
what
i'm
proposing.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
gee,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i'm...
i'm...
i'm
telling
you...
the
way
i'm
answering
the
question
is
that
i
could
imagine,
with
facts
unrelated
to
my
own,
that
there
may
be
certain
forms
of
private
opinion
submitted
in
situations
that
do
not
concern
social
controversy
that
this
court
may
choose
not
to
protect.
not
because--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--not
because--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--oh,
and
it
absolutely
is,
if
that's
the
scenario.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
if
a
man--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--if
a
man
is
an
educator--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--well,
if
it
goes
to
his
qualifications--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--well,
of
course,
it
does.
of
course
it
does.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
well,
first,
i
think
you
have
to
analyze
what
is
being
said.
i
think
that's
the
first
thing
you
have
to
do.
and...
and
if
it
is...
if
what
is
being
said
is
opinion,
then
the...
then
you
next
must
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
in
a
public
or
social
controversy.
if
it
concerns
a
teacher
who
teaches
children,
then
i
think
it
may
be
relevant.
and
if
it
is
truly
opinion,
yes,
it
may
be
protected.
if
it
is
an
educator
who
teaches
children
how
to
wrestle
and
his
qualifications
are
called
into
question
because
the...
the
people
that
he
coached
beat
other
people,
then
i
think,
yes,
his
qualifications
may
be
in
question.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
with
the
qualifications
as
i've
answered
the
court's
question.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
oh,
without
question.
i
do
agree
with
that.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
absolutely
right,
it
can
be
proven
true
or
false.
but--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--well,
if
you're
dealing
with
this
article,
that's
not
what
mr.
diadiun
said.
that
isn't
his
opinion.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is
that--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--well,
if
the
court
has
ruled
that
it...
it
has
to
go
to
the
jury,
but
i'm
not
a
proponent
of
submitting
it
to
the
jury
for
the
reasons
i've...
i've
outlined
to
the
court.
and
i'm
certainly--
first
of
all,
this
case
is
impossible
to
submit
to
a
jury.
there
is
no
transcript
of
the
ohio
high
school
athletic
association.
you
would
probably
literally
be
required
to
call
virtually
every
witness
who
attended
it
in
order
to...
to
give
his
or
her
opinion
as
to
whether
or
not
milkovich
lied
under
oath.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
well,
i
think...
i
think
the
plaintiff
is
very
interested
in...
in...
in
fostering
onto
the
court
that
that
is
the
opinion
of
mr.
diadiun
when
he
wrote
the
article.
but
it
isn't.
it
may
be
a
fact
upon
which
he
relied.
i
mean,
there
is
absolutely...
there
is
absolutely
no
doubt
that...
that
statement
is
in
the
article,
but--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--absolutely,
yes.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
absolutely,
yes.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
i
would
submit
to
you,
justice
stevens,
that,
as
i
pointed
out
before,
i
do
not
see
that
the
speaker's
intention
is
in
any
way
relevant.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
what
is
relevant--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--well--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
sure.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
first
of
all,
you're
absolutely
correct.
the...
the
lower
courts
that...
that
apply
this
principle
generally
apply
that
it
applies
to
individuals
engaged
in
private
situations
or--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--under
that...
under
that
principle.
but
that's
not
the
principle
that
i'm...
that
i'm
requesting
from
the
court.
those
aren't
the
facts
of
my
case.
my
case
concerns
a...
a
public
controversy,
a
social
controversy.
these
are
real
communities.
mentor,
a
neighboring
community
23
miles
away,
had
four
of
its
wrestlers
beaten
up.
they
were
concerned
about
the
safety
of
their
children.
they
went
demanding
an
answer
to
the
ohsaa.
these...
these
things
that
mr.
diadiun
discusses
were
of
major
concern
to
that
local
community.
there
was
tremendous
disagreement
after
the
ohsaa
resolution
and
the
imposition
of
a
severe
censorship.
when--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--well,
i
guess
there's
the
problem.
the
most
false
things
probably,
if
they
can
be
proven
false
in
their
factual
assertions...
and
i
know
it's
a
difficult
concept
because...
because
what
i
think
you
first
must
do
is
analyze
whether
or
not
under
the
proper
test
is
fact
or
opinion.
not
just
simply
with
are
there
some
facts
in
it
which
i
can
prove
true
or
false
but
what
is
the
speaker
saying?
is
it...
and
does
the
reader
perceive
it
as
the
speakers
attitudes?
and
if
he
does,
and
if
it
concerns
a
matter
of
public
controversy,
then
it
should
be
protected.
why?
because
it
promotes
social
and
public
debate.
will
you
inevitably,
as
a
result
of
that
rule,
protect
some
speech
that
shouldn't
be
protected?
quite
probably.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
sure,
it
is.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
well,
it
might
be,
but
i
don't
believe
that
in
this
case
you
can
separate
that
particular
statement
from
the
rest
of
what
mr.
diadiun
is
saying.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
well,
because
it
is
part
and
parcel
of...
of
the
general
opinion
that
failing
to
take
responsibility
is
in
fact
a
lie.
there's
no
doubt
he...
mr.
diadiun
said
mr.
milkovich
was
lying.
but
he
never
meant
to
say
that...
he
never
meant
to
make
a
legal
commentary
on
the...
or
objective
analysis
of
the
legal
effect
of
michael
milkovich's
testimony
in
his
sports
column.
mr.
richard
d.
panza
no.
in
a
sports
column
people
read...
when
people
read
sports
columns,
they
read
it
understanding
that
they're
going
in
many
instances
to
read
opinion.
that
is
different--
mr.
richard
d.
panza
--sports
columnists
tend
to
be
very
opinionated,
justice
kennedy,
and
when
you
read
them,
you
read
them...
when
you
read
what
they
say,
you
read
what
they
say
with
the
understanding
that
they
are
opinionated.
that's
all
i
mean
to
say.
respondent
believes
that
this
article
is
constitutionally
protected
opinion.
if
this
court
concludes
that
it
is
fact,
i
would
ask
you
to
note
that
three
separate
trial
courts
have
found
mr.
milkovich
to
be
a
public
figure,
and/or
a
public
official.
no
court
has
ever
found
any
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
actual
malice.
i
would
ask
you,
then,
to
put
an
end
to
15
years
of
litigation
and
affirm.
thank
you.
