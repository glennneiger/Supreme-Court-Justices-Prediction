mr.
brent
lawson
english
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
sole
question
before
the
court
this
morning
with
respect
to
this
case
is
whether
false
and
defamatory
statements
published
about
the
petitioner
by
the
respondents
are
entitled
to
constitutional
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
there
is
no
constitutional
value
in
false
statements
of
fact.
yet
the
ohio
courts
below
have
afforded
exactly
that
protection
in
this
case.
this
court
has
the
opportunity
to
correct
that
error
and
to
delineate
finally
how
the
opinion/fact
distinction
should
be
made
in
the
context
of
defamation
law.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
your
honor,
not
a
general
matter
of
public
concern,
but
certainly
a
matter
of
public
concern
as
to
the
local
communities
involved.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
your
honor,
i
believe
it
does
fall
under
the
rubric
of
the
hepps
case,
and
had
the
hepps
case
been
properly
followed
by
the
trial
court,
clearly
this
case
would
have
been
actionable
as
opposed
to
absolutely
privileged.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
without
a
doubt,
your
honor,
that
is
absolutely
the
case.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
your
honor,
these
statements
are
quite
capable
of
being
proven
false.
there
are
actually
four
statements
unequivocally
that
could
be
proven
false.
as
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
in
the
milkovich
decision
in
late
1984
held,
the
primary
impact
of
this
article
is
to
accuse
the
petitioner
of
committing
the
crime
of
perjury.
the
proceeding
at
which
the
alleged
perjury
occurred
was
of
records,
stenographically
recorded,
and
clearly
the
testimony
at
that
proceeding
could
easily
be
compared
with
the
statements
that
mr.
milkovich
had
made
previously
as
to
the
same
question.
and
thus,
a
reasonable
jury
could
determine
whether
or
not
the
statements
in
fact
were
false
or
whether
they
were
true.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
your
honor,
i
would
agree
with
you.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
clearly
this
court
in
the
hepps
case
has
indicated,
at
least
with
reference
to
private
individuals
on
matters
of
public
concern
involving
newspapers...
which
is
exactly
the
situation
that
we
have
here...
that
it
is
the
plaintiff's
burden
to
establish
without
resort
to
presumptions
that
a
particular
statement
is
false.
we
believe
that
that
can
be
demonstrated
in
this
instance
without
difficulty
and,
therefore,
the
action
should
have
been
allowed
to
proceed
and
unquestionably
it
should
not
have
been
protected
by
the
first
amendment.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
that
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
the
question
of
opinion.
if
something
cannot
be
proved
true
or
false,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
could
be
properly
labeled
as
opinion.
however,
as
justice
o'connor
has
just
mentioned,
it
may
not
be
necessary
in
this
area
of
the
law
to
even
adopt
any
kind
of
opinion
privilege
if
we
require
a
defamation
plaintiff
to
affirmatively
prove
falsity.
but
in
this
case,
the
allegation
is
that
mr.
milkovich
lied
under
oath
in
a
judicial
proceeding.
that
is
quintessentially
an
assertion
of
fact
which,
if
false,
should
be
actionable
under
the
state
law
of
defamation.
however,
certain
statements,
which
are
very
rhetorical
or
hyperbolic
or
polemical,
which
cannot
be
proved
true
or
false,
could
easily
be
characterized
as
opinion.
however,
it
is
the
petitioner's
judgement
that
this
court
need
not
reach
that
question
in
this
case,
since
based
on
the
hepps
case,
mr.
milkovich
can
demonstrate
his
entitlement
to
at
least
a
jury
determination
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this...
these
statements
were
true
or
false,
and
unquestionably
they
were
defamatory.
your
honors,
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
my
brief,
there
are
many
instances
in
the
past
twenty
years,
after
this
court's
decision
in
gertz
v.
robert
welch,
were
courts
have
presumed
that
there
is
a
broad
first
amendment
based
privilege
in
the
law
of
defamation.
as
a
result
of
that
presumption,
and
this
court
has
never
so
held,
there
have
been
many
courts
that
have
developed
a
series
of
different
formulations
as
to
how
that
distinction
should
be
made,
whether
something
is
an
assertion
of
fact
or
whether
something
is
a
expression
of
opinion.
most
courts
have
relied
first
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
a
statement
is
objectively
verifiable.
and
as
i
have
pointed
out
in
this
instance,
this
statement
is
unequivocally
objectively
verifiable.
this
is
not
a
situation
like,
for
example,
the
case
buckley
v.
littell
decided
by
the
second
circuit
where
there
was
a
statement
that
william
f.
buckley
was
a,
quote,
"fellow
fascist
traveler".
in
that
case,
the
second
circuit
looked
at
that
language
and
said
there
is
no
way
that
that
statement
can
be
in
fact
verifiable.
it
is
loosely
defined
words.
it
is
polemical,
it
is
political
in
nature.
and
as
a
result,
that
statement
is
not
defamatory,
or
even
if
defamatory,
is
not
actionable.
however,
in
the
same
case,
mr.
buckley
was
also
accused
to
having
committed
plagiarism.
and
the
second
circuit
analyzed
that
question
and
said
that,
very
much
like
perjury
or
an
allegation
of
perjury,
is
definitely
empirically
provable,
clearly
is
defamatory,
and
therefore
should
be
actionable.
so
the
second
circuit
has
certainly
recognized
that
there
is
an
opinion
privilege,
but
that
opinion
privilege
only
applies
in
the
area
where
there
is
very
polemical
language,
hyperbolae
being
utilized,
and
where
in
context
the
statement
cannot
be
objectively
verified.
in
this
case,
your
honors,
the
respondents
have
contended
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
decide
this
case
on
the
grounds
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
determined
that
there
is
an
opinion
privilege
under
the
ohio
constitution.
they
cite
the
case
of
michigan
v.
long,
decided
by
this
court
in
1983,
for
that
proposition.
i
would
like
to
address
that
question
directly
because
i
think
it's
important
in
the
context.
the
procedural
history
of
this
case
is
somewhat
unique.
it
has
had
15
years
of
litigation
in
ohio's
courts.
there
have
been
three
attempts
to
bring
this
case
to
the
attention
of
the
united
states
supreme
court,
the
latest
and
presumably
only
successful
one,
being
the
one
sought
be
the
petitioner.
in
michigan
v.
long
this
court
held
that
where
a
state
court
has
unequivocally
determined
an
issue
on
separate
adequate
and
independent
state
grounds,
this
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
question.
however,
in
this
case,
the
decision
from
which
the
appeal
is
taken
is
from
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
appellate
district,
and
not
from
the
ohio
supreme
court.
and
the
decision
of
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
from
the
eleventh
appellate
district
relies
nearly
exclusively
on
federal
precedent
and
also
relies
on
the
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
the
accompanying
scott
case.
as
the
court
is
aware,
the
ohio
supreme
court
in...
in
a
period
of
yet...
just
15
months
has
determined,
on
one
hand,
that
the
statements
in
question
in
this
case
are
constitutionally
protected
as
opinion
under
the
first
amendment,
and
then
15
months
later
determined
that
the
very
same
statements
under
the
very
same
facts,
but
with
a
different
plaintiff,
are
in
fact
constitutionally
protected
or
immunized
by
the
first
amendment.
the
ohio
supreme
court
did
in
fact
mention
on
two
occasions
in
its...
in
its
decision
that
it
was
relying
in
part
on
the
ohio
constitution.
however,
any
fair
reading
of
the
scott
case
clearly
indicates
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
primarily
relying
on
this
court's
decision
on
gertz
against
robert
welch,
decided
in
1974,
and
the
veritable
flood
of
cases
that
have
been
decided
since,
presuming
that
there
is
this
broad
first
amendment-based
privilege.
therefore--
mr.
brent
lawson
english
--yes,
your
honor.
there
are
a
number
of
old
cases
that
hold
that.
however,
there
are
no
cases
that
hold
that
the--
mr.
brent
lawson
english
--they
are...
they
are
pre-new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
basically
standing
for
the
proposition
that
the
ohio
constitution
means
essentially
the
same
thing
as
the
first
amendment
with
respect
to
freedom
of
the
press.
the
two
provisions
are
roughly
the
same,
alchough,
ironically
enough,
the
ohio
constitution
expressly
recognizes
that
there
shall
be
free
speech
subject
to
the
right
of
protection
of
your
reputational
interest
if
you
are
defamed.
whereas,
obviously,
the
first
amendment
says
nothing
about
the
state
law
of
defamation.
the
ohio
supreme
court
in
this
case...
in
the
scott
case,
merely
relied
in
part
on
the
ohio
constitution,
saying
that
it
was
a
separate
source
of
authority
but
quite
clearly
under
the
analysis
provided
in
michigan
v.
long,
which
is
frankly
a
very
analogous
to
this
one,
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
question.
there
are
no
ohio
cases
known
to
the
petitioner
that
specifically
hold
that
the
first...
that
the
section
of
the
ohio
constitution,
article
i,
section
11,
provides
more
protection
for
freedom
of
the
press
than
does
the
first
amendment
to
the
constitution.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
there
is...
i'm...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
that
is
a
statement,
and
then
there
is
a
statement
in
justice
locher's
opinion
for
the
court
that
says
that
the
court
is
relying
on
the
ohio
constitution
as
well
as
the
federal
constitution.
there
is
no
question
that
the
federal
constitutional
provision
is
very
much
interwoven
with
the
ohio
constitutional
provision.
and
thus,
it's
certainly
petitioner's
view
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
scope
of,
or
even
the
applicability
of
a
first
amendment-based
privilege.
your
honors,
if
this
court
adopts
a
first
amendment-based
opinion
privilege,
the
petitioner
would
ask
the
court
to
establish
that
privilege
in
a
very
narrow
manner
and
look
to
two
primary
objective
factors,
as
opposed
to
subjective
factors
on
which
the
ohio
supreme
court
relied
in--
mr.
brent
lawson
english
--your
honor,
i
would
say
that
under
the
hepps
case,
after
the...
after
the
hepps
was
decided
there
is
no
need
for
a
first
amendment-based
privilege,
period.
however,
if
the
court
acknowledges
that
a
first
amendment-based
privilege
is
necessary
in
this
area,
primarily
because
of
the
breathing
space
requirement
that
the
court
has
recognized
ever
since
new
york
times
v.
sullivan,
then
that
privilege
should
be
very
narrowly
drawn,
and
it
should
be
objective
factors.
certainly
one
objective
factor
is
whether
or
not
the
statement
is
objectively
verifiable,
as
justice
o'connor
has
pointed
out,
and
certainly
which
is
now
a
requirement,
constitutional
requirement,
based
on
the
hepps
case.
i
would
suggest--
mr.
brent
lawson
english
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
a
fact
question.
and,
obviously,
if
something
is
not
verifiable...
if
the
plaintiff
cannot
prove
what
the
statement
is,
the
plaintiff,
as
i
read
the
hepps
case,
cannot
recover,
period.
and
that's
a
requirement
of
the
first
amendment--
mr.
brent
lawson
english
--on
speech
of
public
concern.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
your
honor--
mr.
brent
lawson
english
--your
honor,
that...
that
is
the
position
that
i
have
advanced
in
the
brief,
and
i
believe
that
that
would
adequately
protect
the
competing
interest
at
stake.
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
there's
a...
there's
certainly
need
for
a
vigorous
robust
free
press.
but,
however,
there
is
also
a
need
for
an
individual
to
be
able
to
recover
for
reputational
damage.
and
in
this
case,
mr.
milkovich
has
been
attempting
to
do
so
for
15
years
and
has
virtually
every
constitutional
impediment
put
in
his
way,
and
now
we
have
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
making
a
decision
that
on
the
basis
that...
of
essentially
misconstruing
this
article
and
the
specific
allocations
in
it,
that
this
is
somehow
constitutionally
protected
opinion.
you
need
only
look
at
the
article
to
determine
what
in
fact
they
alleged.
the
headline
is
maple
beat
the
law
with
the
"big
lie".
on
the
inside
diadiun
says,
"maple
told
a
lie".
specifically,
and
i
quote,
"anyone
who
attended
the
meet,
whether
he
be
from
maple
heights,
mentor,
or
impartial
observer.
"
those
are
the
schools
involved,
"knows
in
his
heart
that
milkovich
and
scott
lied
at
the
hearing
after
each
having
given
his
solemn
oath
to
tell
the
truth.
"
this
is,
your
honors,
quintessentially
an
assertion
of
fact
which,
if
false,
is
the
proper
subject
for
a
defamation
claim.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
your
honor,
that's
a
very
different
statement
than
what
was
said
in
here.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
no,
i'm
saying--
mr.
brent
lawson
english
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i
think
that
would
be
a
misconstruction
of
the
article.
what
mr.
diadiun
has
said
is
that
everyone
knows
in
his
heart...
he's
making
this
very
fundamental
thing...
everybody
knows
that
this
man
lied
under
oath,
and
he's
specifically
asserting
that.
if
you
get
yourself
in
a
difficult--
mr.
brent
lawson
english
--i
agree.
i
agree.
except--
mr.
brent
lawson
english
--i
would
say
that
it
depends
on
how
the
article
is
written.
but
it
could
potentially
be
opinion.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
well,
i...
i'm
not
suggesting
it
was
written
in
japanese,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
brent
lawson
english
--yes,
sir.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
no...
no
question
about
that.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
and
that's
exactly
the
gist
or
the
sting
of
the
statement,
that
mr.
milkovich
lied
under
oath.
you
can't
read
the
headlines
in
this
article
and
the
specific
allegations--
mr.
brent
lawson
english
--that's
correct.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
that's
correct.
what
we
really
have
is
sort
of
a
mixed
assertion
of
fact
and
commentary.
part
of
the
article
is
commentary,
no
question.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
justice...
judge
friendly
in
second
circuit
noted
in
a
case
that
i
call
the
court's
attention
to...
it's
cianci
v.
new
times
publishing...
a
very
capable
analysis
of
how
it
is
that
someone
might
be
able
to
avoid
this
opinion/fact
distinction
by
saying,
i
think,
i
believe,
it's
my
constitutionally
protected
opinion
that
someone
lied
under
oath.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
it
would
be
clearly
libelous
if
he
said
that.
that
would
just
be
a
ruse.
it's
just
an
attempt
to
avoid
what
is
quite
obvious.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
i
certainly
didn't
mean
to
do
so.
[laughter]
mr.
brent
lawson
english
your
honor,
that's
a
much
closer
call.
that
would...
that
would
raise
the
opinion/fact
formulation
at
the
restatement
of
tort
second
as
to
what--
mr.
brent
lawson
english
--actionable.
i
believe
it
would
be
actionable.
and
obviously
truth
is
a
defense.
if
in
fact
he
relied
on
these
individuals,
and
in
fact
mr.
milkovich
lied
under
oath,
then
he
obviously
has
nothing
to
worry
about.
but
if
he
didn't--
mr.
brent
lawson
english
--i
do
not
agree
with
the
restatement
second.
i
think
it's
way
too
narrow,
and
way
too--
mr.
brent
lawson
english
--that's
correct.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
that's
correct.
that
is
exactly
correct.
your
honors,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
thank
you,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
address
the
last
point
that
mr.
panza
just
made
because
i
think
it
is
a
complete
misstatement
of
the
facts
and
the
law
in
this
case.
the
ohio
supreme
court
on
december
31,
1984
made
a
determination
in
this
case
that
mike
milkovich
was
not
a
public
figure
and
not
a
public
official
and
that
this
statement
was
not
constitutionally
protected
as
opinion.
that
is
the
law
of
this
case.
there
has
not
been
a
determination
by
any
other
court
since
that
time
that
mike
milkovich
is
not
a
public
figure
and
not
a
public
official.
the
respondents
would
have
this
court
believe
that
somehow
the
ohio
supreme
court,
by
deciding
the
scott
case,
has
somehow
sub
silentio
overruled
it's
prior
decision
with
respect
to
mr.
milkovich.
mr.
milkovich's
status--
mr.
brent
lawson
english
--without
a
doubt.
with
respect
to
the
opinion
question,
there
has
been
a
complete
flip-flop.
the
decision
was
four
to
three
in
the
milkovich
case
in
favor
of
making
the
article
actionable,
i.e.,
an
assertion
of
fact,
and
it
was
four
to
three
in
the
scott
case
just
15
months
later
after
two
judges
on
the
ohio
supreme
court
left
the
court
and
two
new
judges
joined
the
court.
there
have
been
now
new
judges
elected
to
the
ohio
supreme
court,
and
it's
unclear,
certainly,
as
to
what
might
happen
with
this
question
unless
this
court
definitively
decides
that
this
article
is
not
constitutionally
protected
as
opinion.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
you
could
not.
however,
going
to
that
question
with
the
michigan
v.
long
analysis
of
separate
adequate
independent
state
grounds,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
the
decision
from
which
the
appeal
is
being
taken
is
from
the
ohio
court
of
appeals,
and
there
is
a
specific
determination
there
that
the
court
is
relying
on
federal
precedent.
clearly,
the
ohio
supreme
court,
again,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
depends
on
the
syllabus
in
the
opinion,
and
the
syllabus
no
way
mentions
that
the
case
is
grounded
either
in
whole
or
in
part
on
the
ohio
constitution.
every
justice
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
wrote
on
the
scott
case,
and
all
but
one
of
the
concurring
judges
in
the
majority
cited
the
federal
constitution
as
being
the
source
for
the
opinion
privilege.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
fine.
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
have
one
last
question,
or
one
last
point
on
rebuttal.
mr.
panza
has
continued
to
note
here
that
the
issue
is
not
what
mr.
diadiun
intended
but,
rather,
what
the
average
reasonable
newspaper
reader
perceived.
and
i
would
agree
with
that
point.
however,
in
his
next
breath
he
says
mr.
diadiun
really
didn't
intend
to
say
that
mike
milkovich
committed
the
crime
of
perjury.
the
relevant
constitutional
inquiry
should
be
how
is
an
average
reader
perceiving
the
article,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out.
and
on
that
score,
a
reasonable
construction
of
the
article
in
this
case
can
lead
to
but
no
other
reasonable
conclusion
than
that
mr.
milkovich
was
accused
of
a
crime
under
ohio
law.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
verifiability
obviously
will...
will
get
us
past
that
problem.
but
if,
for
instance,
there
is
a
reasonable
dispute
as
to
whether
verifiability
is
in
question...
in
other
words,
we
have
a
mixed
question
of
opinion
and
fact...
then
the
relevant
inquiry
should
be
how
does
the
average
reader
perceive
the
question.
mr.
brent
lawson
english
your
honor,
i
believe
it
is
a
question
reasonably
left
to
the
jury.
there
is
no
reasonable
justification
for
making
it
a
legal
question.
it's
not
like
the
determination
of
whether
an
individuals
a
public
figure
or
public
official.
but,
rather,
it
goes
to
how
did
a
reasonable
reader
perceive
this.
and
what
better
group
to
make
that
decision
then
a
jury.
and
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that,
in
this,
case
since
there
was
a
jury
demand,
the
jury
could
easily
make
that
determination
and
decide
whether
or
not
mr.
diadiun's
intent
or
the
average
perception
of
the
newspaper...
or
the
newspaper
audience,
was
whether
he
accused
mr.
milkovich
of
perjury
or
merely
was
stating
this
as
his
alleged
opinion.
for
all
of
the
reasons
i've
mentioned,
petitioner
respectfully
requests
that
the
court
reverse
the
decision
of
the
ohio
court
of
appeals
and
return
this
case
for
trial.
thank
you.
