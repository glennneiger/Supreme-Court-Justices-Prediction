justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
about
your
bright-line
rule?
supposing
the
man
to
be
arrested
opened
the
door
when
it
was
rung
and
said
okay,
i
will
go
with
you,
and
just
walked
right
out
with
them.
could
you
search
his
house?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
he
is
ten
feet...
say
he
is
in
the
hallway
with
his
coat
and
hat
on,
and...
what
does
the
bright-line
rule
provide
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
he
answered
the
door
and
says
just
a
minute,
i
will
get
my
coat
and
come
right
out?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
it
is
hanging
on
a
coat
rack
right
in
plain
sight.
he
says...
they
have
to
sweep
the
whole
house?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
limited
by
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
size
of
the
house?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
a
three-story
house,
and
he
is
in
the
hall
on
the
first
floor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
can
go
through
the
whole
house?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
a
different
rule.
you
are
now
saying
if
in
their
judgment
it
requires
it.
that
is
not
a
categorical
rule
anymore.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
which
would
mean
here
they
could
search,
even
if
their
judgment
wasn't
that
it
required
it,
but
they
thought
well,
if
we
go
through
the
attic
we
might
find
somebody
else
or
some
evidence
that
would
be
useful.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
and
i
mean,
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
that
if
the
rule
authorizes
it,
it
is
perfectly
all
right
to
take
a
look.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
am
sure
the
police
chief
would
say
make
it
standard
operating
procedure.
every
time
you
arrest
a
person
within
the
home,
make
a
sweep
of
the
entire
house
and
keep
your
eyes
open.
it
seems
to
me
a
very
prudent
law
enforcement
practice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
clear
that
it
can
take
place
after
the
arrest
has
been
accomplished?
do
you
draw
any
distinction
at
all
between
a
pre-arrest
sweep
and
a
post-arrest
sweep?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
in
this
case...
i
understand
you
say
the
record
doesn't
support
it,
but
supposing
the
arrestee
had
been
taken
out
of
the
house.
would
it
have
been
then
too
late
to
conduct
a
sweep?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
do
not
draw
a
distinction
between
a
pre-arrest
and
a
post-arrest
sweep?
that
is
what
i
am
asking
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
about
the
woman?
she
is
not
the
accomplice.
you
didn't
suspect
that
she
was
the
accomplice,
did
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
you
know
is
some
woman
answered
the
phone.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
had
no
basis
for
assuming
the
accomplice
was
present.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
is
no
basis
for
believing
she
was
dangerous,
was
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
know
what
strikes
me
as
strange
about
this
case,
the
man
was
in
the
basement
and
he
was
armed,
i
gather,
might
have
been
armed,
and
they
didn't
go
into
the
basement
when
they
thought
he
was
there,
did
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
freeze.
once
he
came
out
they
went
right
down
in
the
basement.
did
they
think
somebody
else
armed
was
in
the
basement,
do
you
suppose--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
was
about
to
shoot
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there
was
a
greater
risk
of
violence
by
entering
the
basement
or
staying
out
of
the
basement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
judgment
this
cop
made
was
i
am
not
going
in
the
basement
until
this
fellow
comes
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
robbins,--
--may
i
just
ask
one
other?
could
he
have
waited
until
the
suspect
was
safely
in
the
police
car
before
he
went
down
in
the
basement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
minimize
the
risk
if
he
got
that
man
out
of
the
way
first.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
question
is
whether,
if
he
took...
they
got
the
man
in
the
police
car
and
they
waited
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
to
the
basement,
after
they
got
him
in
the
police
car,
could
they
have
gone
into
the
basement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know
it's
a
harder
question.
what's
the
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
i
didn't
say
that.
i
said
they
got
the
suspect
into
the
police
car,
however
men
it
took
to
do
that.
there
are
three
or
four
officers
still
in
the
house;
they
see
him
in
there.
can
they
now
go
down
in
the
basement?
it's
a
simple
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
is
it
any
less
intrusive
to
wait
30
seconds
until
they
get
him
out
to
the
car?
it's
exactly
the
same
intrusion
when
they
go
down
to
the
basement.
why
is
it
less
intrusive?
it's
just
less
dangerous.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
know
they
believed
someone
was
in
the
basement?
they
didn't
say
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
in
michigan
against
summers.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
about
michigan
against
summers?
are
you
familiar
with
michigan
against
summers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
persons
attained
there,
there
was
no
suspicion
against
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
the
intrusion
is
precisely
the
intrusion
that
is
permissible
if
they
don't
find
the
arrestee
right
away?
if
they
have
to
search,
they
can
search
the
whole
house
and
the
areas
that
you
are
concerned
about
until
they
find
him.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
to
discontinue
the
search
when
you
find
what
you
are
looking
for.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
why
i
was
suggesting...
i
don't
know
whether
you
draw
a
distinction
or
not,
between
the
portion
of
the
sweep
that
is
continued
after
the
arrest
is
made
and
that
which
is
conducted
while
you
are
looking
for
the
person
and
while
you
are
not
sure
that
you
have
him
under...
in
custody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
for
example,
in
this
very
case
they
didn't
find
him
in
the
basement
right
away.
they
immediately
went
upstairs
to
different
floors,
as
i
remember
the
facts.
i
don't
think...
of
course,
they
didn't
find
anything
upstairs.
but
you
don't...
or
do
you...
do
you
challenge
the
validity
of
the
portion
of
the
sweep
that
took
place
before
they
knew
he
was
in
the
basement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
before
they
found
him.
