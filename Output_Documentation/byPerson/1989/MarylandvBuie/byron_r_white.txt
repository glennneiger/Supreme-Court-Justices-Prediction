justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
would
that...
why
would
it
make
a
difference...
if
you
found
him
out
on
the
front
steps,
you
couldn't
go
in
and
search
the
house,
is
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
don't
you...
you
go
in
and
you
find
him
in
the
front
hall,
then
you
take
him
outside
under
arrest.
now
can
you
go
back
in
and
search
the
whole
house,
which
is
what
happened
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
you
mean,
you
mean
he
wasn't
taken
outside
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
who
do
we
believe?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
expand
the...
do
you
expand
the
reason
that
you
urge
for
making
the
sweep
for
persons
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no
person
around
that
might
destroy
evidence?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
understand,
but
you
don't
try
to
include
within
your
rule
the
advisability
of
making
sure
that
evidence
won't
be
destroyed?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
find
somebody
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
also
said
you
can't
get
outside
that
area.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
everybody
has
been
reading
chimel
not
to
forbid
you
to
go
in
other
parts
of
the
house
when
you
have
an
arrest
warrant
and
you
make
arrest
in
the
house?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
order
to
enter
that
house,
you
not
only
had
to
have
an
arrest
warrant
with
you,
but
you
had
to
have
probable
cause
to
believe
the
man
was
there.
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
need
to
have
a
search
warrant,
but...
you
can
use
your
arrest
warrant,
but
you
have
to
have
probable
cause
to
enter
the
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
but
what
then...
if
you
can't...
if
you
don't
have
the
probable
cause
you
can't
cross
that
threshold.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
and
if
you
haven't
got
probable
cause
to
believe
there
is
somebody
else
in
the
house,
why
can
you
go
to
the
fourth
floor?
justice
byron
r.
white
only,
only
to
hunt
the
arrestee.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
there
is...
i
suppose
if
they
found
two
girls
in
the
house,
and
one...
and
found
one
man,
it
might
be
more
than
conjecture
to
think
that
there
was
a
second
man
in
the
house.
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
to
search
the
house
under
the
arrest
warrant
for
the
accomplice
they
would
have
to
have
probable
cause
to
believe
he
was
in
the
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
oh,
not
really,
not
under
payton.
not
under
payton.
you
can
go
into
a
house
with
an
arrest
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
have
probable
cause
to
believe
he
is
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
couldn't
go
search
this
house
for
the
accomplice
unless
you
had
probable
cause
to
believe
he
was
there,
could
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is...
you
mean
in
buie's
house.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
submission
as
to
what
level
of...
what
would
be
required
to
authorize
a
sweep
in
connection
with
an
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
probable
cause?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
the
state's
submission
and
the
solicitor
general's
submission,
either
one
of
them
or
both,
are
contrary
to
chimel?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
not
only
that,
but
chimel
said
you
needed
a
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
you
had
probable
cause
you
needed
a...
probable
cause
wasn't
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
because
the...
i
was
in
that
case,
and
i
said
they
shouldn't
have
restricted
the
search
if
there
was
probable
cause.
and
the
majority
said
no,
you
need
a
search
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk,
we
vacate
and
remand
for
further
proceedings
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
maryland.
justices
stevens
and
kennedy
have
filed
concurring
opinions;
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissent
in
which
justice
marshall
joins.
