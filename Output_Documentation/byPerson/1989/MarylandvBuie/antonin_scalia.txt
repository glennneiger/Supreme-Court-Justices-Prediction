justice
antonin
scalia
general
sweeney,
maybe
the
rule
you
are
arguing
for
is
a
good
rule,
but
it
baffles
me
why
it
is
a
rule
that
is
based
upon
the
need
to
protect
the
safety
of
the
officers.
it
seems
to
me
the
best
way
for
them
to
assure
their
safety
from
people
hidden
in
the
house
when
they
encounter
this
fellow
in
the
hall
is
to
grab
him
and
pull
him
outside,
if
he
is
there.
you
think
they
are
really
protect...
preserving
their
safety
by
going
up
to
the
attic
to
see
if
there
is
anybody
up
there
who
might
shoot
at
them?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
just
is...
you
know,
that's
just
not
true,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
don't
go
up
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
sweeney,
how
do
you
say
that
there
is
only
minimal
additional
intrusion?
i
mean,
let's
assume
i
am
being
arrested
for
a
securities
fraud
or
something,
and
i
meet
them
in
the
anteroom,
and
i
say
okay,
i
am
ready
to
go.
and
they
say
wait
a
minute,
we
want
to
search
your
house.
and,
you
know,
they
walk
through
my
whole
house,
bedroom,
all
the
rooms.
why...
i
think
that
is...
why
is
that
not
a
terrible
intrusion?
justice
antonin
scalia
different
question,
but
not
whether
it
is
minimal.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kopolow,
i
am
not
sure
i
would
like
to
conduct
an
arrest
on
those...
on
those
terms.
i
mean,
when
my
life
is
at
stake,
why
should
i
assume,
unless
i
have
reason
to
believe
otherwise,
that
there
is
nobody
else
in
the
house.
why...
wouldn't
a
careful
person,
dealing
with
an
armed
robber,
assume,
unless
he
has
reason
to
believe
otherwise,
that
there
is
somebody
else
in
the
house?
you're
dealing
with
violent
people.
isn't
that
an
unreasonable
thing
to
ask
the
police
to
assume,
just
assume
that
there
is
nobody
else,
unless
you
have
good
reason
to
believe
there
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
specific
reason
is
i
am
arresting
a
violent
felon,
and
i
don't
know
for
sure
that
there
is
nobody...
nobody
else
in
there
other
than
this
violent
felon,
who
is
going
to
hurt
me
while
i
am
arresting
them.
now,
you
know,
i
agree
with
your
point
of
view
that
that
doesn't
open
the
whole
house
up,
you
can
be
very
limited
in
the
search.
but
if
i
were
arresting
a
particularly
violent
person,
i
would
not
adopt
the
assumption
that
there
is
nobody
else
in
the
house.
i
would
adopt
the
assumption
that
there
was
somebody
else.
