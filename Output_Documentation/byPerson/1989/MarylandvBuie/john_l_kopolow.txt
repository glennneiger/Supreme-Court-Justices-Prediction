mr.
john
l.
kopolow
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
a
number
of
points
i
would
like
to
respond
to
that
came
up
in
the
arguments
we
just
heard,
beginning
with
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
reasonable
belief,
following
in
other
words,
or
assuming
for
the
time
being,
the
solicitor
general's
preferred
standard.
what
has
to
be
remembered
is
that
the
reasonable
belief
must
be
particularized.
in
a
situation
like
this
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
belief
that
someone
is
in
the
particular
place
to
be
searched,
in
other
words,
in
this
case,
the
basement.
now,
the
solicitor
general--
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
--well,
in
this
particular
case
the
police
had
searched,
apparently,
through
the
rest
of
the
house.
there
was
one
remaining
place
that
had
not
been
checked
for
security
purposes.
so,
they
would
have
to
at
least
believe
that
someone
dangerous
was
in
the
house,
and
the
remaining
place
that
he
or
she
could
have
been
would
have
been
in
the
basement.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
after
having
searched
the
rest
of
the
house.
but
the
police
did
not
articulate
on
the
record
any
facts
that
could
reasonably
allow
them
to
believe
that
a
third
person
was
in
the
house.
let's
begin
with,
in
fact,
the
two
people
that
the
solicitor
general
has
mentioned.
first,
the
accomplice.
the
police
did
not
articulate
any
facts
indicating
the
accomplice
had
ever
been
in
mr.
buie's
house.
and,
in
fact,
the
two-day
surveillance,
which
apparently
began
at
least
on
the
same
day
as
the
robbery,
tends
to
eliminate
that
even
as
a
possibility.
the
solicitor
general
has
also
mentioned
the
girl
or
female,
she
was
described
both
ways,
who
answered
the
phone.
and
what
that
really
amounts
to
is
shear
conjecture
about
at
some
point
three
girls
being
in
the
house.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
police
officers
testified
that
as
they
approached
the
house
and
entered
the
house
they
found
two
girls
on
the
front
steps
outside.
in
order
for
them
to
be
able
to
conjecture
about
three
girls,
they
may
as
well
conjecture
about
four
or
five,
or
a
gang
of
20
girls
in
the
house.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
well,
i
don't
think
that
is
anything
more
than
conjecture,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
there
is
any
more
reason
to
believe
that
the
sexes
are
always
paired
one
by
one
in
every
situation.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
the
record
doesn't
show.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
the
record
only
indicates
as...
indicates
that
they
were
female,
and
at
other
points
they
are
referred
to
as
girls.
the
point
is
that
there
were
no
facts
that
they
could
point
to
indicating
that
a
third
girl
was
in
the
house.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
also
to
the
argument
that
is
put
forth,
the
primary
argument
put
forth
by
the
attorney
general,
and
that
is
that--
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
--yes,
they
were.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
i
would
think
that's
reasonable.
but
simply
because
two
people
know
each
other,
i
don't
think
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
they
are
inseparable.
and
i
don't
think
it
is
reasonable
even
to
conclude,
especially
when
you
have
a
surveillance,
which
presumably
is
designed
to
keep
track
of
who
has
gone
into
the
house
and
come
out
of
the
house,
and
when
there
is
no
testimony
that
they
saw
the
accomplice
in
the
course
of
that
surveillance,
i
don't
think
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
accomplice
was
with
mr.
buie
at
the
time.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
to
search
a
house
for
the
accomplice,
under
an
arrest
warrant
for
the
accomplice,
they
would
have
to
in
fact
have
a
search
warrant
for
mr.
buie's
house.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
that--
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
--i
understood
you
to
say
that
it
was
a
search
for
the
accomplice.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
i
believe
you
would
not
only
need
probable
cause,
you
would
need
a
search
warrant
to
search
mr.
buie's
house
for
a
third
party.
that
is
the
holding
of
steagald.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
yes,
to
search
buie's
house
for
the
accomplice.
now,
state
seems
to
be
saying
that
it
is
prudent
in
every
case,
and
they
didn't
specifically
state
this,
but
they
seem
to
be
suggesting
that
it
is
routine
in
every
case.
well,
on
the
matter
of
whether
it
is
routine
or
not,
i
would
simply
point
out
that
if
it's
routine,
then
police
are
routinely
violating
the
decisions
of
virtually
every
court
in
this
country.
because
all
of
them,
as
the
solicitor
general
has
pointed
out,
adopt
at
least
a
reasonable
suspicion
terry-type
standard.
a
great
many
of
them
prefer
the
probable
cause
standard,
which
was
adopted
by
the
court
below.
i
don't
think
we
can
assume
that
police
throughout
the
country
are
routinely
violating
all
those
decisions,
at
least
without
something
in
the
record
proving
the
contrary.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
yes.
and
now
i
am
addressing
whether
they
can
do
it
simply
as
a
matter
of
course,
the
bright-line
per
se
rule.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
the
state's
argument.
it,
perhaps,
from
a
subjective
police
point
of
view,
is
prudent
to
check
the
house
for
possible
third
parties
in
every
case.
but
i
think
that
particular
point
of
view
ignores
the
other
side
of
the
equation
that
has
to
be
balanced,
which
is
the
privacy
rights
of
the
people
that
inhabit
the
house.
in
fact,
the
fourth
amendment
in
general
does
require
some
degree,
at
least,
of
particularized
suspicion.
now,
in
order
to
overcome
that
normal
requirement,
the
state
would
have
to
show
first
that
there
is
a
relatively
minimal
intrusion
here.
and
i
think
the
intrusion
that
is
involved
in
a
protective
sweep
is
really
akin
to
the
intrusion
of
a
full-blown
search
of
a
house.
it
involves
opening
up
the
private
places
of
a
house.
perhaps,
at
least
within
the
state's
view
of
a
protective
sweep,
it's
limited
to
the
extent
that
the
police
could
not
go
into
small
spaces,
such
as
drawers.
but
the
state,
i
believe,
would
concede
that
they
can
open
up
closet
doors.
and
i
think
what
is
inside
a
closet
may
be
just
as
private
to
a
reasonable
individual
as
what
is
inside
a
drawer.
so,
i
think
in
character
the
protective
sweep
is
essentially
the
same
as
a
full-blown
sweep,
which
is
perhaps,
as
far
as
searches
of
places,
the
most
closely
protected
kind
of
intrusion.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
no,
i
am...
i
would
define
a
full-blown
sweep...
i
am
sorry,
a
full-blown
search,
as
one
which
includes
opening
up
desk
drawers,
and
i--
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
--there
is
perhaps
a
difference
in
degree,
your
honor,
between
what
the
state
is
advocating
and
a
full-blown
search.
but
i
am
saying
that
in
their
essential
character
they
are
really
the
same,
because
they
allow
the
police
to
go
into
very
private
places,
to
open
up
to
view
very
private
places.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
i
think
it
is
only
a
difference
in
degree.
but
i
would
also
ask,
or
say,
in
regard
to
whether
there
should
be
a
per
se
rule,
that
there
is
a
line
drawing
question.
there
must
be
a
reasonable
line
drawn
as
to
how
far
they
can
go
in
several
respects,
one
of
which
is
this
question
of
how
intense,
or
how
thorough
the
search
can
be.
i
would
suggest
this
example.
assume
that
a
protective
sweep
is
conducted
and
an
individual
is
found
in
the
house.
under
a
per
se
rule
where
there
is
an
automatic
right,
would
there
then
become
an
automatic
right
to
go
into
a
drawer,
which
is
proximate
to
that
particular
person,
to
make
sure
that
there
is
not
a
weapon
there
that
he
can
grab.
i
think
if
the
police
are,
if
the
justification
for
the
search
is
wholly
protective,
and
there
is
an
automatic
per
se
rule,
that
really
the
protective
sweep
should
not
be
limited
in
the
sense
the
state
is
suggesting.
it
should
even
include
that
particular
example.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
what
would
his
answer
be?
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
certainly
that
individual
has,
himself,
fourth
amendment
rights.
i
would
think
they
would
need
at
least
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
that
person
poses
a
danger
before
they
could
even
do
a
terry
type--
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
--if
i
were
the
state's
attorney,
you
want
me
to
answer
that
question?
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
who
is
on
the
other
side?
[laughter]
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
i
don't
recall
them
talking
about
that
particular
aspect
of
the
problem,
because
in
each
case
that
i
have
read
anyway,
they
are
concerned
about
the
rights
of
the
person
who
was
arrested.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
of
course,
the
closest
case
i
know
of
is
ybarra
v.
illinois,
which
involved
a
search
pursuant
to
a
search
warrant
of
a
bar,
a
public
establishment.
and
in
that
case
this
court
held
that
there
had
to
be
reasonable
suspicion
before
a
patron
of
the
bar
could
be
frisked.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
yes,
i
am.
i
think
that's
a
quite
different
situation,
because--
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
--but
the
court
said
that
there
was...
that
the
very
circumstances
amounted
to
individualized
and
articulable
suspicion.
the
fact
of
the
search
warrant
for
the
house
indicated
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
criminal
activity
was
taking
place
in
the
house,
and
that
automatically
translated
into
at
least
individualized
and
articulable
suspicion
with
respect
to
any
occupant
of
the
house.
and
that...
that's
what
justified
a
brief
detention.
i
would
also
point
out
that
i
believe
the
intrusion
in
this
case
is
a
much
more
severe
intrusion
than
a
brief
detention.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
to
answer
your
question
with
an
example,
that
would
be
the
same
as
saying...
let's
say
the...
there
is
a
search
warrant
to
search
a
house
for
a--
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
--yes,
to
be
a
particular--
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
--well,
i
think,
isn't
that
a
question,
your
honor,
of
what
authority
the
police
are
given
under
an
arrest
warrant?
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
their
authority
to
act
pursuant
to
the
arrest
warrant
ends
as
soon
as
the
arrest
is
made.
now,
there
may
be
circumstances
which
would
permit
a
further
search,
but
that
depends
on
the
particular
circumstances.
if
the
police
can
demonstrate
on
the
record
a
need
for
an
additional
search--
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
--we
do
not
challenge
the
validity
of
the
portion
of
that
sweep.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
before
they
found
him.
but
our
contention
is
that
once
the
arrest
is
accomplished,
their
authority
to
act
pursuant
to
the
arrest
warrant
ends,
and
they
must
point
to
additional
circumstances.
that
leads
to
a
point
that
justice
scalia
was
making
about
whether
they
in
fact
took
reasonable
action
once
they
had
made
the
arrest.
now,
of
course,
the
cases
do
not
require
the
police
to
take
the
less
intrusive
alternative
when
two
alternatives
are
both
reasonable.
but
i
think
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
what
justice
scalia
was
suggesting
indicates
that
the
action
that
they
did
take
was
unreasonable.
on
the
one
hand,
the
action
that
they
did
take
was
that
an
officer,
purporting
to
fear
somebody
down
in
the
basement,
went
down
there
with
no
apparent
precautions
taken,
apparently
not
even
his
gun
drawn,
and
in
fact
was
setting
himself
up
as
easy
prey
for
an
ambusher.
on
the
other
hand,
what
they
could
have
done,
which
is
what
at
least
they
began
to
do,
which
is
they
whisked
mr.
buie
out
of
the
house,
and
then
an
unintrusive
additional
action,
which
to
me
is
perfectly
sensible,
would
have
been
simply
to
station
somebody
in
the
hallway
of
the
house
in
a
protected
position,
so
that
if
there
was
a
chance
of
somebody
coming
up
out
of
the
basement
they
would
have
the
drop
on
that
individual,
rather
than
vice
versa.
so
this
is
a
situation
where
i
think
the
failure
to
take
the
less
intrusive
alternative
in
fact
makes
the
alternative
that
they
did
take
unreasonable.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
of
maryland
was
correct,
and--
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
--probable
cause
is
required.
and
the
reason
is
that,
as
the
opinions
of
this
court
have
shown,
that
in
residential
situations
danger
to
the
police
is
not
enough
to
compromise
the
probable
cause
standard.
and
perhaps
the
clearest
example
of
that
is
the
hot
pursuit
situation,
where,
if
the
police
are
in
hot
pursuit
of
an
armed
robber
and
he
enters
a
residence,
they
can
go
in,
if
they
have
probable
cause,
they
can
go
in
to
arrest
him
and
to
search
for
weapons.
if
they
have
only
articulable
suspicion,
they
can't
do
so,
even
though
there
is,
as
the
court
has
pointed
out
in
warden
v.
hayden,
a
great
risk
to
the
police
officers.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
i
think
they
certainly
put
chimel
in
great
danger.
chimel
indicated
that
in
order
to
do
a
search
past
the
time
of
the
arrest,
a
search
other
than
the
area
into
which
the
arrestee
may
reach,
there
would
need
to
be
probable
cause
and
a
warrant.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
probable
cause
and
a
search
warrant.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
that
is
my
reading
of
chimel
as
well.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
and
if
i
remember
your
opinion
correctly,
you
even
pointed
out,
in
your
opinion,
that
the
man's
wife
was
there
would
could
have
presented
some
risk
at
least
to
the
evidence.
yet,
notwithstanding
that,
the
search
was
very
limited.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
i
think
some
latitude
has
to
be
given,
if
they
are
able
to
articulate
the
reasons
for
their
actions
on
the
record.
in
this
case
what
we
have
is
the
police
officer
being
asked
flat
out
did
you
have
any
reason
to
believe
anybody
other
than
mr.
buie
was
in
the
house.
his
answer
was
i
didn't
know
who
lived
there.
in
other
words,
he
did
not
have
any
reason
to
believe--
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
--well,
i
think
it
is
certainly
an
invitation
for
him
to
state,
to
articulate
his
reasons,
which
is
at
least
what
the
terry
standard
requires.
he
didn't...
he
declined
the
invitation
to
do
that.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
i
think
there
at
least
have
to
be
reasonable
inferences
drawable
from
what
the
police
officer
said.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
i
would
say
that
on
this
record
that
even
those
facts,
that
would
permit
a
reasonable
court
to
draw
the
inferences,
are
lacking.
if
you
are
asking
me
does
the
police
officer
have
to
articulate
reasons
with
the
precision
that
presumably
lawyers
and
judges
might
do
so,
no,
i
wouldn't
make
that
expectation
of
a
police
officer.
but
he
does
have
to
at
least
give
reasons,
in
this
case,
that
would
support
a
belief
that
somebody
else
was
in
the
house,
somebody
else
dangerous.
and
that
is
simply
lacking.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
i
think
what
your
honor
is
doing
is
saying...
is
really
presuming
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
based
on
the
fact
that
the
basement
was
entered.
but
the
law
says
that
the
search
is
presumed
to
be
unreasonable
unless
the
police
can
sustain
the
burden
of
articulating
facts,
particularized
to
the
particular
place
that
they
are
searching.
and
the
reason
for
that,
and
perhaps
i
am
repeating
myself,
is
that...
what
my
understanding
of
the
attitude
that
you
are
expressing
is
that
perhaps
in
some
subjective
sense
it
is
reasonable
for
the
police
to
act
that
way.
but
that
is
not
taking
into
consideration
the
countervailing
interests
of
privacy,
and
the
fourth
amendment,
as
interpreted
by
this
court,
has
always
required
the
police
to
articulate
specific
facts.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
well,
the
problem
with
that
is,
is
fourth
amendment
intrusions
really
based
not
on
the
information
the
police
have,
it's
based
on
the
lack
of
information
the
police
have.
the
only
information
that
i
believe
you
have
articulated
just
now
is
that
this
was
a
violent
crime.
but
the
fact
that
this
is
a
violent
crime
doesn't
say
anything
about
who
else
may
be
in
the
house.
that
is
simply
a
non
sequitur.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
it
depends,
perhaps,
on
who
the
person
is.
i
assume
you
are
thinking
of
the
accomplice.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
well,
i
think
what
your
honor
is
coming
down...
is
coming
back
to,
is
a
per
se
rule,
that
in
every
case
the
police
should
be
able
to
sweep
through
the
house.
and
i
don't
think
it
can
be
limited,
really,
to
the
boundaries...
it
can
be
rationally
limited
to
the
boundaries
of
the
house.
for
instance,
as
was
suggested
in
the
earlier
arguments,
might
not
the
police
sense
danger
from
a
neighboring
apartment,
if
it
involves
the
sweep
of
an
apartment?
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
in
the
context
of
a
terry
stop,
the
police
cannot
assume
that
the
suspect
is
armed
and
dangerous.
yet
that
is
a
possibility
in
every
case.
the
police
officer
has
to
point
to
some...
some
particular
facts.
that
is
my
understanding
of
how
the
fourth
amendment
cases
have
been
developing.
to
translate
that
particular
holding
into
this
case,
the
police
cannot
assume
that
someone
else,
someone
else
dangerous,
is
in
the
basement.
they
have
to--
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
--well,
i
am
assuming
that
we
are
talking
about
the
terry
standard.
i
don't
want
to
be
interpreted
as
espousing
the
terry
standard.
i
still
believe,
for
the
reasons
i
stated
earlier,
that
probable
cause--
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
--if
he
has
articulated
suspicion
that
crime
is
afoot
he
can
make
the
stop.
he
cannot
go
any
further
unless
he
has
articulated
suspicion
that
the
person
he
has
stopped
is
armed
and
dangerous.
and
translated
into
this
case,
he
has
to
have
articulated
suspicion
that
somebody
who
is
dangerous
is
in
the
basement.
mr.
john
l.
kopolow
well,
there
again,
once
the
stop...
in
michigan
v.
long,
once
the
stop
is
lawfully
made,
there
cannot
be
an
automatic
search
of
the
car,
the
passenger
compartment
of
the
car,
for
weapons.
there
has
to
be
articulated
suspicion
that
there
may
be
weapons
in
the
car
and
that
the
person
stopped
is
dangerous.
i
think
that
is
the
clear
holding
of
michigan
v.
long.
well,
unless
your
honors
have
further
questions,
thank
you.
