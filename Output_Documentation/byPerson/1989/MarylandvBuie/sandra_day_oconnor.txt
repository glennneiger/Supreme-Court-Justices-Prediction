now,
the
solicitor
general
suggests
a
test
that
may
differ
from
that
which
you
are
suggesting.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
a
practical
matter,
what
is
the
police
practice
on
in-home
arrests?
is
it
typical
that
a
so-called
protective
sweep
be
made,
or
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
this
case,
was
there
sufficient
basis
on
which
the
officers
could
have
obtained
a
search
warrant
at
the
same
time
they
got
the
arrest
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
would
that
unfold
in
this
case,
on
these
facts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
am
not
sure
that
i
understand
why
the
mere
suspicion
that
another
person
might
be
in
the
house
amounts
to
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
officer
might
be
at
risk.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just,
it
doesn't
track,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
that's
all
you
had.
it
wasn't
a
crime
of
violence
for
which
an
arrest
was
made.
you
didn't...
the
police
didn't
know
that
a
weapon
was
used,
allegedly,
in
the
offense.
yet
an
arrest
is
made.
just
because
another
person
may
be
in
the
house--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--justifies
a
walk-through?
