mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
police
officers
possessing
an...
a
arrest
warrant
for
an
armed
robbery
suspect
may,
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
of
the
suspect
in
his
home,
make
a
brief
security
check
of
the
premises
to
determine
if
other
persons
are
present.
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
decided
that
the
state
must
show
that
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
a
serious
and
demonstrable
potentiality
for
danger
exists
to
justify
a
safety
check
in
this
type
of
situation.
finding
the
probable
cause
for
a
safety
check
did
not
exist
in
this
case.
it
held
that
a
red
running
suit
seized
by
one
of
the
officers
during
the
security
check
should
have
been
suppressed.
a
new
trial
was
ordered,
setting
aside
mr.
buie's
35-year
sentence
for
armed
robbery
and
use
of
a
handgun
in
the
commission
of
a
felony.
the
state
asserts
that
safety
checks
of
homes
at
the
time
of
arrest,
under
the
authority
of
an
arrest
warrant,
should
be
analyzed
under
the
general
reasonableness
balancing
test.
applying
this
test,
the
balancing
of
mr.
buie's
minimal
privacy
interest
affected
by
the
safety
check
against
the
compelling
need
to
preserve
the
safety
of
officers
and
others
at
the
arrest
scene,
is
best
met
by
establishing
a
bright-line
rule,
a
single,
workable
standard
authorizing
a
brief
and
limited
check
of
the
home,
without
any
need
for
objective
justification
in
each
case.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
that
is
correct.
we
argue
that
also
in
the
alternative,
the
reasonable
suspicion
test.
we,
however,
believe
that
this
is
best
served
by
a
categorical
rule,
a
bright-line
rule
which
would
authorize
such
checks
in
every
situation
of
an
in-home
arrest
for
a
dangerous
crime.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
there
is
nothing
evidentiary
in
this
record
on
that
practice.
however,
since
the...
this
court's
decision
in
chimel,
there
have
been
legions
of
cases
which
have
been
collected
by
both
parties
and
which
have
been
analyzed
in
the
law
reviews,
which
indicate
that
this
is
a
very
common
police
practice,
indeed
a
police
rubric,
after
an
arrest
to
conduct
a
limited
sweep
of
the
premises
to
determine
if
other
individuals
are
on
the
premises.
this
type
of
procedure
has
been
recognized
by
the
12
federal
circuits,
by
33
state
courts,
as
prudent
police
conduct.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
if
the
officers,
at
the
time
they
obtained
the
arrest
warrant,
if
there
was
a
standard
that
required
a
warrant
in
such
situations,
we
believe
that
a
warrant
could
have
been
obtained,
but
that
is...
in
a
sense
backs
right
into
our
bright-line
rule.
because,
it
is
our
contention,
that
every
arrest
for
a
dangerous
crime
is
the
type
of
situation
that
requires
a
safety
check
to
be
made.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
i
believe
the,
the
best
bright-line
rule
would
provide
that
if
the
officers
do
not
need
to
cross
the
threshold
of
the
home--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--the
bright-line
rule
provides
that
if
the
officers
need
to
go
into
the
house,
which
i
think
they
would
if
he
is
ten
feet
inside
the
house--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--i
don't
believe
the
officers
could
trust
that
statement
if
they
are
dealing
with
an
individual
who
has
a--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--if,
if
they
cross
the
threshold,
the
best
workable
rule
would
be
that
the
officers
can
do
a
limited
and
brief
security
check.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
limited--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--limited
in
two
ways.
one
is
that
it
is
brief.
limited
also
in
that
it
is
a
search
for
persons.
it
is--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--that
is
correct.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
it...
under
the
rule
that
we
are
proposing--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--i
don't
believe
that
the
record
is
consistent
with
that.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
no,
i
don't
believe...
there
is
a
statement
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
that
indicates
that
the
individual
was...
had
left
the
scene--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--well,
the
record
in
the
case,
the
trial
record
in
the
case
says
that
the
individual
was
handcuffed,
and
then
the
second
officer,
officer
frolich,
detective
frolich,
went
down
into
the
basement.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
evidentiary
record
in
this
case
that
the
officer...
that
the
individual
was
taken
outside
of
the
house.
that
statement
was
made
in
the
court
of
appeals'
decision,
but
it
does
not
have
any
support
in
the
factual,
in
the
trial
transcript
of
this
case.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
there's...
there--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--it
is,
it
is
going
to
be
true
in
very
many
arrests
that
the
necessary
thing
to
do
is
to
do
a
sweep
of
the
house.
it
will
not
necessarily
be
true
in
every
arrest.
and
the
safety
concern
that
we're
proposing
to
this
court
is
not
just
the
safety
of
the
officers,
but
the
safety
of
others
at
the
arrest
scene.
and
that
if
the
officers
make
the
determination,
they
don't...
this...
they
do
not
have
to
do
a
protective
sweep
of
the
house,
but
they
are
authorized
to
do
a
protective
sweep
of
the
house
if
the
situation,
in
their
judgment,
requires
it
for
their
safety
or
the
safety
of
others.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
no,
it's
a
categorical
rule
like
the
belton
rule.
the
belton
rule
says
that
officers
can
search
every
container--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--well,
it's
an
objective
test.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
it's
an
objective...
it's
an
objective
test.
and
if
the,
if
the
rule,
if
the
bright-line
rule
is,
does
not
require
specific
justification,
which
we
contend
it
does
not
then,
then
the
officers
can
conduct
the
sweep
of
the
premises.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
it,
i
would
agree
with
you.
it
could
very
well
be
a
very
prudent
law
enforcement
practice.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
that
is
not
this
case.
obviously,
if
the
officers
see
someone
who
is
destroying
evidence,
or
who
is--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--we
have
not...
we
have
not
argued
that
to
this
court.
but
obviously
that
is
a,
an
ancillary
event
that
occurs
if
a
protective
sweep
occurs.
the
primary
reason
why
a
protective
sweep
should
occur
is
for
protection.
now,
it
will
also
serve
the
benefit
of
preventing
the
destruction
of
evidence
that
may
be--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--if
you
find...
if
you
find
someone.
you
never
are
going
to
be
guaranteed
that
you
will
find
someone.
but
that
is
precisely
the
point
that
i
think
makes
this
a
particularly
appropriate
case
for
a
bright-line
rule.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
no,
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
any
inconsistency
there.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
believe
it
is
a
natural
extension
of
chimel.
in
chimel
the
court
decided
that
for
protective
reasons
primarily,
as
i
read
the
case,
the
officers
could
do
a
limited
search
of
the
person
and
a
limited
search
of
the
wingspan
area.
that
was
to
take
care
of
concerns
regarding
the
arrestee.
but--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--it
said,
as
i
read
that
decision,
it
says
that
in
connection
with
the
concern
regarding
the
arrestee.
it
does
not
deal
with
safety
concerns
regarding
others,
regarding
accomplices,
who
may
be
at
the
scene.
this--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--a...
those
decisions
have
read
it
when
there
is
a
search
for
evidence,
that
is
where
chimel
is
read
to
go
beyond
the
wingspan
area,
to
prevent
those
type
of
searches.
there
has
been...
chimel
is
very
interesting
because
that
is
when
you
begin
to
see
the
protective
sweep
cases.
there
has
been
20
years
of
protective
sweep
cases
from
the
12
circuits,
33
state
courts,
all
recognizing
that
protective
sweeps
are
prudent
police
conduct.
it
is
a
natural
outgrowth
of
the
chimel
case
that,
because
it
did
not
consider
the
safety
concerns
surrounding
the
arrests
that
go
beyond
the
arrestee.
this
case
presents
those
additional
safety
concerns.
and
chimel
is
in
fact
a
bright-line
rule--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--i
am
sorry,
justice--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--that...
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
well,
because
an
individual
may
be
on
the
fourth
floor,
may
be
down
in
the
basement,
may
be
anywhere
in
that
house,
who
could
present
a
danger
to
the
officers.
in
this
case--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--well,
if
he...
if
the
police
officers
had
the
reassurance--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--well,
that
is,
that...
you
know,
there
are
many
judgments
that,
regarding
police
practice
or
police
procedure,
that
can
be...
can
be...
alternatives
can
be
considered,
police
judgments
can
be
second
guessed.
i
think
one
of
the
things
these,
this
court's
decision
teaches,
for
example
in
pennsylvania
v.
mimms,
about
the
bright-line
rule
for
individuals
to
leave
the
vehicle
if
the
officer
requests
it
at
the
scene,
is
that,
while
that
is
a
very
acceptable
police
practice,
the
dissent
notes
that
some
police
manuals
counsel
the
exact
opposite
of
that
procedure.
so
simply
the
fact
that
there
may
be
an
alternative
procedure
is
not
the
type
of
thing,
as
this
court
said
in
united
states
v.
sharpe,
that
courts
should
get
into
second-guessing
officer
practices.
it
is
a
reasonable
fourth
amendment
conduct
for
police
officers
to
do
a
protective
sweep
of
the
premises--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--i
am
sorry.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
that
requires
the
crossing
of
another
threshold.
that
requires
entry
into
a
home.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
it
may
be
closer
than
the
fourth
floor,
but
one
of
the
things
this
court's
decisions
have
said
over
and
over
again
is
there
shall
be
no
breach
of
the
entry,
no
crossing
of
the
threshold
without
legal
authority.
it
is
very
important
to
remember
that
the
officers
in
this
case
are
on
the
premises
lawfully,
as
a
result
of
the
arrest
warrant.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
you
had
to
have
the--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--i
believe
the
arrest
warrant
provides
probable
cause
for
the
officers
to--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--well,
the
officers...
if
the
officers
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
he
is
there,
present,--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--that
is
correct.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
well,
if
you
are
lawfully
on
the
premises,
if
you
are...
if
the
officers
are
lawfully
on
the
premises
and
inside
of
the
house,
then
the
concerns
that
this
court
has
enunciated
regarding
the
breaching
of
the
threshold
of
the
house,
i
think,
are...
the
arrest
has
to
be
seen
in
context
at
that
point.
the...
under
the
payton
decision,
the
officers
can
go
anywhere
in
the
house
to
find
the
arrestee--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--only
to
find
the
arrestee.
they
can
go
from
the
fourth
floor
to
the
basement,
and
the
additional
intrusion
here,
and
remember
we
are
considering
mr.
buie's
interest
here,
the
additional
intrusion
is
a
minimal
intrusion
over
and
above
that
intrusion
which
is
already
authorized
by
this
court's
decisions
in
payton
v.
new
york--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--yes.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
i'll
give
you
an
example
from
this
case.
there
were
two
girls
who
were
immediately
outside
the
door
of
the
house
who
could
have
been
in
danger
if
there
had
been
an
attack
on
the
officers
as
the
officers
were
leaving
the
scene.
they
could
have
been
in
the
line
of
fire--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
an
ambush
or
an
attack,
to
protect
the
officers,
to
protect
others
at
the
scene,
to
protect
the
arrestee
himself.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
i...
for
any
safety
concern
that
an
arrest
has
attendant
to
it.
i
can't
think
of
other...
an
attack
or
an
ambush,
or
let's
say
a
young
child
comes
out
from
a
room,
and,
during
the
arrest
scene,
and
creates
a
confusion.
there
is
a
safety
dimension
to
that...
to
that
also.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
that
not
only...
not
on
the
basis
of
the
safety
to
the
officers,
that
obviously
is
a
safety
concern
regarding
others
at
the...
at
the
arrest
scene.
we
have
not--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--we
have
not
urged
that
ground.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
it
is
not
a
terrible
intrusion.
i
would
concede
it
is
a
greater
intrusion
than,
say,
in
pennsylvania
v.
mimms,
they're
just
standing
outside
the
car.
but
the
intrusion
has
to
be
measured
and
balanced
against
the
compelling
need
for
officers'
lives
and
officers'
safety
here.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
i
think
it
is
also
minimal
in
connection
with
the
limits.
it
has
to
be
brief,
it's
got
to
be
quick,
it
has
got
to
be
limited
to
searches
for
persons.
i
would
like
to...
i
am
sorry?
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
the
pre-arrest
is
governed
by
the
payton
v.
new
york.
our
vision
of
the
arrest,
which
is
important
here,
is
the
arrest
is
not
completed,
for
safety
purposes,
until
the
officers
are
off
of
the
scene.
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
no,
it's...
in
our--
mr.
dennis
m.
sweeney
--if
the
officers
were...
the
post-arrest
occurs
after
the
officers
and
the
individual
are
safely
out
of
the
arrest
scene
area.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
could.
