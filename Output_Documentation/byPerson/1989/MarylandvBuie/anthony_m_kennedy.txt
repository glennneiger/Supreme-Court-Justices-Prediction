justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mention
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
that
was
for
the
protection...
excuse
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
to
enter
a
house.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mention
that
one
of
the
purposes
for
the
sweep
search
is
to
protect
the
safety
of
others?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
that
work?
give
me
an
example.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
is
substantially
the
same
as
protecting
the
officers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
is
substantially
the
same
as...
the
rationale
is
to
protect
the
officers
from
an
ambush
or
an
attack?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
from
an
ambush
or
an
attack?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
was
going
to
ask,
suppose
there
is
an
unattended
child,
infant,
left
in
the
house
after
the
arrestee
is
taken.
is
that
grounds
for
a
sweep
search?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
one
of
the
grounds
that
you
urge
for
the
sweep
search?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
before
you
get
there,
because
i
am
interested
in
it,
the...
there
were
two
arrest
warrants,
both
for,
for
both...
both
were
for
males,
were
they
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
is
reasonable
to
conclude
that
robbery
accomplices
know
each
other?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
know
if
the
state's
attorney
were
at
the
podium,
what
would
their
answer
be
if
i
said
what
do
you
do
when
you
find
this
person?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
they
order
the
person
to
leave,
to
go
outside?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
[laughter]
xxx
respondent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
can
answer
both
ways.
do
the
cases
talk
about
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
police
procedures,
police
training,
don't
require
them
to
assume
that
the
best
possible
circumstances
prevail
when
they
make
an
arrest.
it
requires
them
to
assume
that
the
worst
possible
circumstances
may
prevail.
everybody's
handcuffed
when
they
go
into
the
police
car.
everybody...
every
stopped
car
is
approached
at
night
with
the
same
degree
of
caution.
and
police
are
trained
this
way.
and
it
seems
to
me
rather
difficult
for
you
to
ask
us
to
make
the
assumption
that
safety
conditions
will
generally
prevail,
or
that
a
safe
condition
would
generally
prevail
when
they
enter
into
a
home.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
of
course
in
that
case,
articulated
suspicion
suffices.
and
you
would
say
articulated
suspicion
suffices
in
this
case.
that
is
short
of
probable
cause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
we
have
held
in
terry
that
you
need,
you
do
not
need
probable
cause
to
protect
the
safety
of
the
officer
when
he
has
some
articulated
suspicion
to
believe
that
crime
is
afoot.
