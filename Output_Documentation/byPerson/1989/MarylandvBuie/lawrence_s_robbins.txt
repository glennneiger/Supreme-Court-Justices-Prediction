mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
maryland
court
of
appeals,
in
our
view,
got
off
to
the
right
start
in
this
case.
it
explained
correctly
that
in
deciding
what
legal
standard
to
apply
to
a
protective
sweep
a
court
must
consider
the
objective
expectation
of
privacy
that
may
exist
and
the
governmental
interest
served
by
the
intrusion.
but
having
taken
that
first
step,
the
court
erred,
in
our
view,
in
elaborating
that
rule
in
this
context,
by
overstating
the
intrusiveness
of
a
protective
sweep
and
undervaluing
the
governmental
interest
to
justify
those
searches.
the
court
resolved
upon
what
we
believe
to
be
an
untenable
legal
standard,
that
a
protective
sweep
may
be
conducted
only
upon
a
showing
of
probable
cause.
we
urge
a
different
rule,
the
rule
that
has
been
approved
by
virtually
every
federal
circuit
other
than,
i
think,
the
fifth
circuit,
and
one
that
is
based
on
our
quite
different
assessment
of
the
competing
interest.
that
rule
is
the
one
derived
from
terry
against
ohio,
and
it
is
this:
following
an
arrest
inside
a
suspect's
premises,
the,
a
protective
sweep
is
lawful
when
the
police
have
a
reasonable
belief
that
their
security
is
in
jeopardy.
now,
that
rule--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--on
these
facts,
justice
o'connor,
we
believe
that
the
police
did
indeed
have
a
reasonably...
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
their
security
was
at
risk
in
the
execution
of
this
arrest
warrant.
and
we
say
that--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--several
factors,
we
think,
combine
to
make
that
suspicion
reasonable.
first
of
all,
this
was
a
violent
crime.
an
armed
robbery
committed
only
48
hours
before
the
search.
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
an
accomplice
had
participated
in
that
search,
that
is
the
result
of
the
issuance
of
an
arrest
warrant.
there
was
a
weapon
used
in
the
offense;
it
was
an
armed
robbery.
and
finally
and
critically,
there
was
a
strong
likelihood
that
there
was
at
least
one
other
person
in
the
house
at
the
time
the
police
went
to
arrest
the
respondent.
you
will
recall
from
the
record
that
just
before
the
police
went
in,
a
secretary
at
police
headquarters
called
up
the
house
to
find
out
if
indeed
respondent
was
home.
they
didn't
get
respondent
on
the
phone
right
away,
they
got
a
woman
of
some
undetermined
age.
she
has
been
referred
to
as
a
girl,
a
young
woman.
all
we
know
is
that
she
is
a
female.
we
don't
know
who
she
is,
how
old
she
is--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--of
course,
justice--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
it
depends
what
you
mean
by
the
mere
fact.
obviously,
we
are
not
relying
solely
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
good
reason
to
think
there
was
someone
else
in
the
house--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no,
no.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
not
at
all.
and
we
urge
no
such
rule.
our
rule
is
a
rule
of
reasonable
suspicion,
and
it
obviously
turns
on
the
presence
of
all
of
the
factors.
if
this
were,
for
example,
a
securities
fraud,
to
return
to
justice
scalia's
hypothetical,
and
the
only...
the
only
suspicion
you
had
was
that
the
defendant's
three-year-old
child
was
at
home,
that
would
hardly,
in
our
judgment,
amount
to
reasonable
suspicion.
reasonableness
is
as
reasonableness
does.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
in
this,
in
the
present
case...
there
was
no
way--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
of
course,
it
couldn't
be...
it
couldn't
be
the
accomplice
in
mr.
buie's
case--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--because
it
wasn't
a
woman.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that's
correct...
well,
there
was
no
basis
for
believing
that
the
one
confirmed
person
in
the
house,
a
woman,
was
indeed
the
accomplice,
because
it
wasn't
a
woman.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
there
was
no
basis
for
eliminating
that
prospect.
and
given
the
fact
that
this
was
a
violent
crime,
with
in
all
likelihood
a
weapon
in
the
house
and
a
high
risk
to
the
police
in
executing
such
an
arrest
the
fact
that
there
was
some
person
in
the
house--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--they
called
down--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think,
justice
stevens--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think,
justice
stevens,
what
they
thought,
or
in
any
event
what
the
objective
factors
would
have
justified
them
in
thinking,
was
that
in
fact
another
person
could
well
have
been
in
the
house
and
would
pose
a
risk
of
interference
with
that
arrest
and
a
risk
of
injury
to
the
police.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
that's
that
kind
of
judgment
that
cops
have
got
to
be
allowed
to
make.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
he
took,
i
think,
a
less
intrusive
first
step.
and
that
is
a
sensible
thing.
come
up
if
you
are
there.
but
i
don't
think
that
he
was
obliged
to
eliminate
from
his
mind
the
very
real
prospect
that
in
this
set
of
facts
a
reasonable...
a
reasonably
founded
suspicion
of
risk
was
present.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think
that
once
he--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
if
the
question
is
whether
he
can
go
back
in--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think
that
would
be
a
much
harder
case.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
if
they
were
all
entirely
out
of
the
house,
and
mr.
buie
was
in
the
police
car,
i
don't
think
they
could
go
back
in--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--on
this,
on
the
set
of
facts
presented
in
this
case,
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
on
the
other
hand,
justice
stevens,
i
think
this
court's
fourth
amendment
cases
make
clear
that
the
simple
fact
that
one
can
imagine
a
less
intrusive
way
of
doing
the
same
operation
does
not
make
it
unreasonable
to
do
it
in
the
way
that
they
did
it.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i...
i
am
not
at
all
persuaded
that
it
would
be
less
dangerous
to
wait...
if
they
believed,
as
they
did,
that
there
was
someone
else
present
in
the
house,
the
process
of
taking--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no,
that's
correct.
they
didn't
testify
to
that.
on
the
other
hand,
i
believe
the
facts
are
sufficient
to
justify
a
reasonable
belief
that
they
were
at
risk.
and
during
the
process
of
taking
the
suspect
out
of
the
house,
that
risk
continues.
and
the
question
is
how
are
the
police
to
eliminate
that
risk,
or
at
least
minimize
that
risk?
now,
what--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
believe
it
was,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
where
you
are
dealing
with
weapons
and
an
armed
robbery
and
the
possibility
of
violence,
the
fact
that
someone
is
on
the
fourth
floor
rather
than
in
the
next
room--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
i
think
at
some
point--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
question
is
one
of
reasonableness.
at
some
point--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
i
wouldn't...
i
wouldn't
say
it
is
reasonable
only
to
search
his
arms
reach,
because
the
risk--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
because
the
risk
of
people
interfering
with
an
arrest
stem
from
more
than
the
place
where
the
suspect--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--by
shooting
him.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
that
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
and
i
think
the
police
are--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--your
honor,
the
possibility
that
there
can
be
ambush
from
rooms
on
a
different
floor
is
just
not
that
far
fetched.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
your
honor,
the
question
is
whether
this
arrest
will
be
allowed
to
take
place,
and
whether
the
police
have
a
reasonable
apprehension
of
injury.
and
i
think
that
the
fact
that
somebody
may
be
outside
the
arms
reach
of
the
suspect--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
think
that
would
make
it
a
harder
case
to
justify.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
the
answer
is,
of
course,
in
any
other
reasonable
suspicion...
as
in
any
other
reasonable
suspicion
is,
it
depends.
i
suspect
in
this
case
it
would
not
have
been
a
reasonable
police
practice
for
them
to
do
that.
but
recall,
all
they
did
here
was
to
go
one
flight
below
the
very
place
where
their
man
was
in
custody.
that
was
reasonable.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
what
i
have
said
is--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--you
don't
have
to
in
this
case.
what
i
am
saying
is
don't
preclude
them--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
am
saying,
your
honor,
that
you
needn't
have
a
rule
that
precludes
the
police,
in
an
appropriate
case,
from
looking
beyond
the
floor
that
they
happen
to
be
on.
if,
for
example,
it
was
the
palace
of
versailles,
you
wouldn't
have
to
go
in
the
next
wing.
but
in
a
small
house
you
may
have
to
go
upstairs.
