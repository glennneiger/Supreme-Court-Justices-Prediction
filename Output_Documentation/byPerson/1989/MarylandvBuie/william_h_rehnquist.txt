chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
88-1369,
maryland
v.
jerome
edward
buie.
mr.
sweeney,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
there
is
any
inconsistency
between
your
position
and
the
court's
opinion
in
chimel,
or
chimel,
however
you
want
to
pronounce
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sweeney.
mr.
robbins,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
must
it
be
that
particularized,
mr.
kopolow?
you
mean,
you
have
to
feel
that
someone
is
in
the
basement,
rather
than
on
the
second
floor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
after
having
searched
the
other
part.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
previous
argument
has
been
directed
to
the
point
that
the
state
hasn't
even
shown
reasonable
suspicion
here,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
state's
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
full-blown
sweep,
in
your
view,
would
not
authorize
the
opening
of
desk
drawers
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
a
full-blown
search
differs
in
that
respect
from
a
protective
sweep.
you
can't
open
drawers,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
certainly
many
people
would
feel
that
it
is
an
even,
certainly
a
considerable
additional
intrusion,
the
opening
of
drawers
and
that
sort
of
thing,
which
is
not
allowed
in
this.
so,
there's
people
who
wouldn't
agree
with
you;
i
think
they
would
say
there
is
a
difference
in
degree.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
if
i
may,
mr.
kopolow.
in
some
of
these
hypotheses
we
have
been
talking
about,
you
know,
which
was
the
sensible
thing
for
the
police
to
do,
et
cetera,
do
you
think
some
latitude
has
to
be
given
to
the
judgment
of
the
people
who
have
been...
the
police
who
have
been
through
these
things?
do
you
think
lawyers
and
judges
can
apprehend
just
as
well
from
a
record
what
the
real
dangers
of
the
situation
were,
than
the
police?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that
isn't
saying,
that
isn't
a
negative
answer
to
that
question.
it
may,
it
is
not
a
positive
answer.
it
may
be
an
evasive
answer,
but
it
is
not
a
negative
answer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
a
police
officer
can
state
enough
about
the
situation
as
he
apprehended
it,
which
someone
else
would
find
reasonable,
to
lead
someone
else
to
say,
you
know,
this
is
the
basis
on
which
a
search
could
have
been
conducted.
does
all
the
reasoning
have
to
have
come
from
the
police
officer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
must
he
be
the
one
that...
supposing
that...
a
court
feels
it
can
draw
reasonable
inferences
from
what
has
been
testified
to
by
a
police
officer.
is
that
enough,
even
though
the
police
officer
may
not
have
himself,
in
testimony,
drawn
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
says
something
about
the
possible
characteristics
of
another
person
in
the
house,
if
they
might
be
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yeah,
but
you
know,
we
can't
reduce
every
one
of
these
things
to
a
strictly
logical
proposition
governed
by
marquis
of
queensbury
rules.
there
has
got
to
be
some
play
in
the
joints.
and
there
are
cases
that
have
said
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
some
of
our
more
recent
cases
have
allowed
the
person...
an
officer
to
go
further
than
just
the
frisk
in
connection
with
a
terry
stop.
i
think
michigan
against
long
did,
and
i
think
another
case
has.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kopolow.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
no.
88-1369,
maryland
against
buie
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
