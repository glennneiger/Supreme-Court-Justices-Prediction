mr.
mark
r.
lippman
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent's
argument
begins
at
the
heart
of
the
government's
waiver
theory.
the
government
maintains
that
many
mandatory
rules,
like
rights,
carry
a
general
presumption
of
waivability,
that
we
must
evaluate
all
mandatory
rules
and
statutory
procedures
against
a
backdrop
of
the
overarching
implied
waiver
principle.
to
support
this
contention,
the
government
cites
the
stipulation
practice,
and
the
shutte
case,
a
120-year-old
case.
the
stipulation
practice,
however,
is
fundamentally
different
from
the
government's
affirmative
waiver
regime.
stipulations
are
an
old,
common
law
practice
which
began
well
before
the
passage
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
and
continues
today,
but
it
is
a
very
limited
doctrine,
and
allows
parties
to
avoid
proving
nondisputed
issues,
or
issues
which
at
the
time
are
not
perceived
material
to
the
proceeding.
the
purpose
behind
stipulations
is
to
save
time
and
expense,
rather
than
having
the
parties
go
through
the
formality
of
proving
a
fact
not
at
issue,
and
that's
always
what
stipulations
have
always
been,
never
more.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
again,
the
same
rationale
applies,
your
honor,
and
that
is
that
it's
a
time-saving
device.
why
should
the
parties
go
through
the
formality
of
proving
an
issue
of
fact,
or
whatever,
if
it's
already
conceded
that
it's
not
material?
all
it
does
is
take
up
court
time.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
yes,
but
the
purpose,
the
underlying
rationale
is
that
it's
pointless
to
go
through
the
exercise
of
proving
it,
the
parties
don't
contest
it,
and
that's
always,
always
what
stipulations
have
always
been.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
the
way
i
would
distinguish
that,
your
honor,
is
that
there
are
proper
stipulations,
and
there
are
not
proper
stipulations.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
well,
i'm
not
sure
about
that,
your
honor.
it
might
be
a
close
question.
what
i'm
saying
here
is
that
an
affirmative
waiver,
like
the
one
we
have
here,
is
nothing
like
the
typical
stipulations
that
we've
come
to
know.
an
affirmative
waiver
such
as
here
bargains
away
and
gives
up
fundamental
procedural
requirements
and
protections
material
to
the
case.
to
be
more
specific,
your
honor,
in
the
present
context,
the
justice
department
could
not
require
a
defendant
to
waive
certain
hearsay
requirements
imposed
on
the
government's
case
as
a
condition
of
a
plea
negotiation,
and
that's
the
fundamental
distinction.
stipulations
and
waivers
are
not
the
same,
and
let
me
continue
with
that
thought.
stipulations
are
always
subject
to
the
court's
control.
the
purpose
is
to
make
sure
it
remains
within
the
spirit
of
stipulations.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
right.
i
guess
the
point
i
use,
the
stipulation
package,
your
honor,
is
that
that
is
all
they
have
to
support
their
contention
that
rules,
that
everything
in
the
law
carries
a
presumption
of
waivability,
and
i
think
that's
fundamentally
wrong.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
and
let
me
explain
why.
why...
we
know
for
a
fact
that
there
are
many
statutes
and
rules
that
have...
that
contain
enabling
clauses.
for
example,
absent
the
parties'
agreement,
this
is
to
be
done.
if
we
buy
the
government's
argument,
then
all
those
enabling
clauses
are
rendered
superfluous.
now,
clearly
congress
did
not
create
all
those
rules
and
statutes
for
an
academic
exercise.
i
think
my
reading
of
the...
my
understanding
of
stipulations
and
enabling
clauses
gives
effect
to
everything.
stipulations
deal
with
superficial
agreements
for
time-saving.
enabling
clauses
allow
parties
to
complete
major
changes
in
procedure.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
what
i'm
saying
is
that
rules
that
have
a
public
function
cannot,
such
as
this--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--i
think
that
there's
some
helpful
guidelines
that
the
court
can
use
to
determine
whether
a
rule
has
a
public
function
or
is
a
personal
right.
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
one
that
strictly
has
a
personal
benefit
and
no
further,
your
honor,
like
constitutional
rights,
because
they're
just
personal
rights.
if
i
may
continue--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--no,
i
wouldn't
go
that
far,
your
honor.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
it's
difficult
to
draw
lines,
but
it's
clear
that
certain
rights,
certain
rules
have
more
of
a
public
function.
the
speedy
trial
act,
for
example,
the
time
provisions,
are
not
waivable,
and
they
are
not
waivable
because
there
is
a
societal
interest
in
having
cases
or
defendants
tried
expeditiously
irrespective
of
what
the
parties
want.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
the
right,
your
honor?
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
but
the
time
provisions
of
the
act
are
not--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--and
what
i'm
saying
is,
congress
has
treated--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--there
is
legislative
history,
but
the
courts
that
have
considered
the
issue
have
said
that
the
reason
it's
not
waivable,
your
honor,
is
because
society
has
an
independent
interest
in
seeing
that
cases
are
moved
along
irrespective
of
what
the
parties
believe--
let
me...
if
i
could
continue
to
answer
your
question
this
way,
your
honor,
in
united
states
v.
olano
justice
kennedy,
you
said
that
rule
24(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
is
a
product
of
a
judgment,
that
our
jury
system
should
have
a
constant
and
stable
structure,
one
that
cannot
be
varied
by
stipulation
with
or
without
the
consent
of
the
parties.
i
think
that
is
distinction
that
is
applicable
here.
in
other
words,
isn't
congress
trying
to
creat
a
permanent
and
constant
structure,
the
plea
bargain
mechanism,
in
plea
negotiation?
the
government
has
conceded,
now,
that
rule
11,
perhaps
all
the
rule
11
provisions
except
11(e)(6),
are
not
waivable,
but
isn't
congress,
by
placing
the
policing
rule
in
that
entire
structure,
aren't
they
telling
us
something,
that
this
is
one
continuum
from
the
beginning
of
plea
negotiation
to
the
open
plea?
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
my
response,
your
honor,
is
that
congress
thought
long
and
hard
about
how
to
create
exclusion,
and
in
creating
exceptions
to
it,
it
believed,
and
the
legislative
history
supports,
that
by
this
exclusion,
it
would
encourage
and
promote
frank
and
open
candid
plea
discussion.
that
was
a
broad
rule
to--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--i'm
saying
that
congress
included
a
broad
distinction
that
applied
to
both
contexts,
and
just
because
there
is...
estrada's
distinction
of
cooperation
or
more
cooperation
type
agreements
from
ones
that
are
more
classical
bargain
type
agreements
is
creating
a
distinction
that
congress
didn't
make
in
the
rules.
the
rules
speak
in
mandatory
and
clear
terms,
and--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--i'm
not
so
sure
i
can
generalize
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
we
have
to...
rather
than
my
experience,
i...
to
just
answer
your
question,
your
honor,
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
what
congress
was
doing.
i
get
the
sense
the
government
has
its
own
agenda
and
its
own
distinctions,
and
perhaps
they
could
have
argued
that
when
the
rules
were
promulgated,
but
congress
saw
a
broad
exclusion
that
applied
in
the
context,
and
they've
limited
in
saying
that
now
the
government's
counsel
has
to
be
present,
and
they've
created
two
exceptions
to
it,
and
they're
saying,
look,
it's
not
enough.
we
have
defendants
that
lie,
and
it
is
frustrating
our
investigation.
but
congress
didn't
buy
it.
congress
wasn't
blind
to
the
lying
problem,
or
the
misconduct
problem.
we
know
that
from
the
legislative
history,
and
we
know
that
from
the
perjury
exception.
what
the
government
is
effectively
doing
is
saying,
look,
the
rules
are
inadequate.
the
cooperation
is
really
what
it's
all
about.
but
shouldn't
they
be
going
back
to
congress
and
seeking
another
amendment
to
the
rule,
or
broadening...
or...
excuse
me,
your
honor,
just
broadening
or
changing
the
rules?
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
i
would
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
i
just...
no,
i
don't,
your
honor,
and
let
me
explain
why.
i
think
that
it
boils
down
to
whether
you
look
at
it
as
a
right,
and
on
a
right
under
johnson
v.
zerbst,
you
look
at
the
voluntariness
issue.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
wanted
an
absolute
and
inflexible
rule,
and
the
reason
they
want
it
is,
if
you
look
at
how
intricate
and
elaborate
the
rule
is,
and
all
the
exceptions,
it
suggests
to
me
that
congress
didn't
want
to
go
through
the
formal
exercise
of
creating
rules
that
could
be
expressly
waived
away,
or
parties
could
create
exceptions,
or
in
the
government's
view,
the
free
market
theory
of
contracts.
to
me
that...
it's
counterintuitive
to
the
very
specificity
and
intricacy
of
the
rules,
and
that
they
tried
to
balance
all
these
interests,
and
they
tried
to
realize
that
in
creating
effectively
the
rule
106
or
the
exception
that
creates
the
completion
doctrine
that
if
there
was
abuse
that
the
government
could
avoid
it.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
well,
it
would
be
reviewed
under
a
plain
error
standard,
your
honor,
under
the
forfeiture
analysis
set
forth
in
united
states
v.
olano,
but
again,
forfeitures
and
waivers
are
two
different
animals,
as
this
court
laid
out
pretty
clearly
in
united
states
v.
olano.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
no.
no,
and
olano
says
that
it's
never
right.
in
other
words,
if
there's
error
in
the
first
instance
to
waive
a
rule
or
right,
and
the
fact
that
nobody
made
a
timely
objection
doesn't
make
it
right
because
someone
failed
to
make
a
timely
objection.
what
it
means
is
that
on
appellate
review
we're
going
to
look
at
a
different
standard,
and
the
policies
for
the
two
are
quite
different.
in
other
words,
for
the
forfeiture
analysis,
that
promotes
efficient
proceeding
where
the
judge
has
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
impropriety
of
the
procedure
and
he
can
rule
and
make...
and
correct
them,
but
if
he
doesn't
do
that,
then
effectively
he
bars
the
judge
from
making
those
corrections,
and
i
think
that's
pretty
clear
in
olano,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
well,
rule
7(a)
is
considered
nonwaivable,
your
honor,
the
indictment
requirement
that
i
cited
that...
i
believe
smith
v.
united
states
is
the
indictment--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--well,
the...
as
a
rule
of
procedure,
your
honor?
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
the
fair
labor
standards
act
would
be
one,
your
honor.
that's
a
nonwaivable
right.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
oh,
you're
saying
rule
of...
i'm
sorry,
you
said--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--well,
i
consider
the
time...
sure.
the
time
provisions
of
the
speedy
trial
act
are
nonwaivable,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
again,
i
don't
believe
that
rule
24(c),
and
i
think
in
the
concurring
opinion
with
justice
kennedy
indicated
so.
i...
the
problem
is
that
the
question
hasn't
come
up.
there
isn't
much
law
either
way
on
the
point,
and
i
would
comfortably
assert
that
you
cannot
waive
hearsay
requirements
even
though
they're
between
the
parties.
it's
not
a...
a
stipulation--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--yes,
but
it's
a
stipulation,
your
honor,
and
i'm
trying
to
create
the
distinction
between
a
stipulation
and
a
waiver.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
you
forfeit
it,
your
honor,
and
there's
a
distinction...
u.s.
v.
olano.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
between
a
forfeiture
and
a
waiver,
your
honor,
or--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--a
forfeiture
is
where
the
parties
were...
a
procedure
is
improper,
and
that's
assumed.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
i--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--yes.
yes.
yes,
very
much
so.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
no,
no,
i
guess
i
don't...
i
don't...
i
guess
i
don't
understand
your
question.
what
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--well,
maybe
not,
your
honor.
let
me
get
another
crack
at
it.
would
you
ask
the
question
again?
what
i'm
saying
is,
if
someone
doesn't
raise
a
timely
objection
to
a
hearsay
requirement,
that's
error
under
olano,
and
it's
reviewed
under
plain
error--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--i
guess
i'd
answer
this
question
by
looking
at
the
facts
of
united
states
v.
olano.
there,
the
judge
invited
stipulations
that
alternate
jurors
could
sit
in
with
the
jurors
during
deliberation
in
violation
of
rule
24(c).
the
parties
ultimately
agreed,
and
the
case...
and
the
case...
defendant
was
tried
and
convicted.
defendant
argued
that
it
was
error
to
admit
the
evidence.
i
mean,
to
stipulate
to
the
violation
of
24(c).
the
court
agreed,
or
it
was
assumed.
justice
kennedy
in
his
concurring
opinion
seemed
to
indicate
that
yes,
it
was
error.
the
government
agreed
and
conceded
it
probably
was
error,
and
so
the
analysis
whether...
rose
to
the
level
of
plain
error.
so
there's
a
fundamental
distinction
here,
and
i
think
maybe,
going
back,
you
know,
that
a
careful
reading
of
united
states
v.
olano
will
make
that
absolutely
clear.
it's
the
court's
holding.
i
think
that
i
really
disagree
with
the
government's
characterization
of
the
prestatement
rules
as
rights,
and
they
do
it,
and
they
argue
it
basically
because
the
protections
just
run
to
the
defendant.
but
we
know
that
through
the
advisory
committees
they
limited
the
protection
of
the
defendant
just
because...
just
to
the
defendant
because
they
wanted...
they
didn't
want
third
parties
getting
the
protection
of
the
rules
because
they
thought
that
that
rule
was
too
broad,
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
assume
that
they
felt
the
government
didn't
need
the
protections
because
the
defendant
is
usually
the
one
that's
giving
the
incriminating
and
helpful
information,
not
the
other
way
around.
so
it's
a
fundamental
misreading
of
the
rules
to
say
that
that's
a
right
just
because
it's
protection
that
runs
to
the
defendant,
and
it's
even
more
of
a
misreading
when
you
look
in
a
larger
context
and
see
that
congress
really
wanted
cases
settled,
and
their
view...
we
may
disagree
with
it,
but
their
view
was
that
the
best
way
to
balance
the
interest
and
get
cases
settled
was
to
have
this
exclusion
as
an
absolute
exclusion
in
every
case,
so
the
system
and
institution
could
work
efficiently.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
it
would
depend
on
the
con--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
a
good
trial
judge
would
determine
what
the
purpose
of
a
stipulation
was.
for
example--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--well,
you
just
let
it
in
at
the
time,
rather
than--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--what
i'd...
i
guess
it's
difficult
for
me
to
analyze
a
rule...
i'm
trying
to
understand
your
facts.
what
i'm
saying
is,
to
answer
your
question,
your
honor,
what
i
would
say
is,
the
stipulation
practice
is
not
a
proper
package
to
rewrite
the
rules
of
evidence
and
rewrite
the
rules
of
procedure,
and
if
you
follow
the
government's
argument,
that
is
the
ultimate
logic,
that
if
we
can
waive,
through
stipulation
or
any
affirmative
agreement,
that
we
can,
even
though
congress
has
laid
out
mandatory
rules
of
procedure
and
evidence,
that
means
that
we
can
just
write
our
own.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
what
i'm
saying
is,
that's
essentially
a
forfeiture,
and
i--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--it's
the
review
for
plain
error,
your
honor.
it's
a
different
analysis,
and
i
think
united
states
v.
olano
really
sets
it
out
quite
clearly.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
it's
nothing...
unlike
invited
error,
your
honor,
or
a
party...
it's...
parties
can't
basically
sandbag
and
then
receive
a
benefit
on
review
for
it.
i
don't
really
see
this
as
a
dramatic
proposition
at
all,
but
maybe
i...
maybe
i'm
not
understanding
your
question.
i...
getting
back,
i
think
that
if
we
could
characterize
this
as
rights,
allow
the
government
to
convince
us
that
these
are
really
rights
that
are
waivable,
then
there
goes
the
integrity
and
meaning
of
the
rule,
for
then,
as
justice
kennedy
said,
what
would
prevent...
and
the
government
concedes...
them
from
pursuing
extracting
waivers
for
substantive
evidence,
indeed,
for
any
purpose
and
for
any
proceeding.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
his
concurring
opinion
on
the
nonwaivability
of--
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
--correct,
it
was
his
concurring
opinion.
mr.
mark
r.
lippman
well,
the
government
conceded
that
it
was
nonwaivable,
and
went
on
that
assumption,
and
it
seems
that
justice
kennedy
had
good
reasons
for
considering
it
to
be
a
non...
a
nonwaivable
rule.
again,
getting
back,
if
we
allow
the
court...
the
government
to
extract...
to
characterize
this
as
rights,
then
there
goes
the
rule
that
any
integrity
and
meaning
to
it
is
lost,
and
the
government
now
muscles
through
and
calls
the
shots,
and
overrides
the
spirit
and
the
intent
of
congress.
the
government
argues
that
they
really
won't
have
an
incentive,
or
if
a
defendant
will
not,
that
it's
not
a
problem,
because
defendants
won't
voluntarily
give
up
the
protections
when
it
comes
to
substantive
evidence,
but
that's
not
true
with
the
exposure
they
face.
they
feel
if
they
cooperate
and
the
government
will
act
in
good
faith,
why
shouldn't
they?
why
shouldn't
they
run
the
risk,
just
like
running
the
risk
with
impeachment
evidence?
i
think
the
legislative
history
is
helpful
because
it
shows
that
the
waiver
argument
here
is
nothing
more
than
a
device
to
circumvent
the
legislative
mandate.
they
tried
again
and
again
to
get
the
impeachment
exception,
and
they
lost,
and
they
would
ask
you
to
be
blind
to
that
fact
and
say,
well,
we're
on
a
clean
slate
now,
it's
a
waiver,
it's
a
totally
different
ball
game,
and
i
would
disagree,
that
i
think
the
legislative
history
does
inform
this
analysis,
and
that
it's
clear
that
it's
just
a
way
to,
again
to
circumvent
the
mandate.
i
thank
you,
your
honors.
