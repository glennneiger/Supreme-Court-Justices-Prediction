in
your
judgment,
are
there
any
nondisposable
evidence
rules,
procedure
rules,
any
rules
in
the
criminal
process
that
are
not
disposable
by
the
parties?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
going
back
to
your
starting
premise.
of
course
the
government
can't
make
anybody
waive
anything,
but
then
the
government
can
say,
okay,
then
we
don't
want
to
bargain.
justice
ruth

ginsburg
isn't
that
true
about
our
legal
system
generally,
that
we
are...
we
follow
the
party
control
principle,
as
distinguished
from
other
systems
that
don't?
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
lippman,
i've
heard
trial
attorneys
say
any
number
of
times
to
the
jury,
i
could
object,
but
i
want
you
to
hear
everything,
so
i'm
not
raising
it.
i
want
everything
to
be
before
you
as
triers
of
the
fact.
i'm
not
holding
back
anything.
isn't
that
common
in
trials?
so
the
defense
attorney
is
making
a
point
of
the
utter
candor
on
the
defense's
side
and
saying,
i
am
not
going
to
raise
these
objections
that
i
could
have.
