mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
criminal
defendant
may
waive
the
protection
of
evidence
rule
410
and
criminal
rule
11(3)(6),
both
of
which
provide
in
identical
terms
that
evidence
of
plea
discussions
is
not
admissible
against
the
defendant.
respondent
was
charged
with
drug
possession.
he
and
his
lawyer
sought
a
meeting
with
the
prosecutor
to
explore
whether
the
government
might
use
respondent
as
a
witness
against
others.
the
prosecutor
agreed
to
the
meeting
because
respondent
in
turn
agreed
that
if
he
said
anything
at
the
meeting
that
was
inconsistent
with
any
later
trial
testimony
by
him,
the
prosecutor
would
have
the
right
to
use
the
statements
at
the
meeting
to
impeach
the
trial
testimony.
respondent
ultimately
did
go
to
trial,
testified,
and
was
impeached
in
accordance
with
that
agreement.
the
jury
found
him
guilty,
but
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
it
ruled
that
the
rights
conferred
by
rule
410
and
rule
11(e)(6)
are
not
waivable,
and
that
an
agreement
purporting
to
do
so
would
chill
plea
bargaining
and
violate
public
policy
for
that
reason.
we
brought
the
case
here
because
we
strongly
disagree
with
those
conclusions.
we
start
with
the
language
of
the
rules.
the
rules
provide
that
evidence
of
plea
discussions
is
inadmissible
not
in
all
circumstances
but
only
when
offered
against
the
defendant
who
made
the
statements.
that
language
strongly
indicates,
we
think,
that
the
rules
are
intended
for
the
protection
of
the
criminal
defendant,
and
that
is
consistent
with
a
long
tradition
in
our
system
of
laws
generally,
and
of
the
practice
of
the
rules
of
evidence
in
particular,
as
justice
scalia
noticed
in
green
v.
bulk
laundry,
of
providing
special
protections
for
defendants
in
criminal
cases.
this
court
has
looked
at
the
issue
of
waiver
in
many
cases
involving
those
special
protections,
including
some
of
the
most
valuable
rights
secured
by
the
constitution
to
criminal
defendants,
and
has
consistently
ruled
that
those
protections
may
be
waived
by
defendants.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
we
think
that
so
far
as
the
waivability
of
the
rule
goes,
justice
kennedy,
which
is
really
a
question
about
whether
the
right
is
personal,
the
answer
to
that
is
yes.
i
cannot
imagine
that
any
criminal
defendant
would
do
so
unless
he
otherwise
intended
to
plead
guilty.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
justice
kennedy,
if
he
makes
that
judgment
knowingly,
it's
no
different
from
the
judgment
that
criminal
defendants
made
every
day...
excuse
me,
make
every
day
concerning
whether
they
wish
to
confess
to
the
crime.
ordinarily
we
think
of
that
as
an
affirmative
good,
and
if
they
recognize
that
this
is
evidence
that
may
be
used
against
them,
and
they
do
so
knowingly,
i
doubt
that
very
many
will
do
it,
but
there
will
be
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
that
may
be
true,
justice
souter--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes,
it
is
a
difference,
and
it
should
not
make
a
difference
for
the
following
reason.
he,
unlike
the
government,
knows
what
he
will
say,
and
he
is...
he
has
perfectly...
he
has
it
perfectly
within
his
control
to
sort
of
understand
what
it
is
that
he
will
tell
the
government
and
to
make
a
judgment
as
to
whether
that
is
something
that
he
wishes
to
communicate
to
the
government.
but
your
point
i
think
raises
a
point
on
the
public
policy
part
of
this
argument
that
is
very
important
and
that
i
think
bears
stressing,
which
is
that
the
context
in
which
the
government
asks
for
this
is
extremely
important,
and
we
brought
this
case
to
the
court
on
the
assumption
that
the
context
is
important.
and
the
context
is
that
the
government
is
talking
to
the
defendant
in
the
context
of
his
proffer
of
cooperation,
and
in
the
context
of
that
proffer
of
cooperation,
the
government
often
would
not
meet
with
a
criminal
defendant
even
in
the
absence
of
a
waiver.
and
there
is
a
good
reason
for
that,
because
statements
made
by
cooperating
witnesses
may
be
used
in
undercover
work
that
is
dangerous
and
life-threatening,
and
may
be
relied
on
to
put
other
people
in
jail,
and
we
think
that
it
is
reasonable
for
the
government
to
think
that
somebody
who
is
coming
to
the
government
to
cooperate
only
if
he
can
retain
the
ability
to
tell
a
different
story
under
oath
at
a
later
trial,
should
not
be
a
government
witness.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
under
our
view
of
the
validity
of
the
waiver,
yes.
under
his
view
of
it,
no.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
no.
no,
justice
stevens,
because
the
rule
requires
that
in
order
to
be
admissible
at
any
prosecution,
including
one
for
perjury,
the
statement
must
have
been
made
on
the
record
and
under
oath,
so
even
though
this
is
a
statement
that
would
meet
all
the
elements
of
1001,
and
as
made
to
the
prosecutor
if
it
was
fault
would
be
a
federal
crime,
under
the
strict
reading
of
the
rule--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes,
but
then
we
would
have
a...
a)
that
statement
would
not
be
covered
by
the
rule
in
any
event,
because
that
statement
is
not
a
statement
made
during
plea
discussions,
his
own
testimony
as
to
what
the
underlying
facts
were,
and
b)
there
would
be
some--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--difficulty
showing
to
a
second
jury--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--no,
we
don't,
and
that,
of
course,
wouldn't
do
the
whole
trick,
because
it
would
have
to
be
on
the
record,
and
there
is
a
fair--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--we
make
a
record
in
terms
of
having
an
agent
who
is
at
the
interview
and
who
will
prepare
a
report
who
is
then
furnished
to
the
defendants
for
discovery.
i
do
not
think
that
that's
toward
a
rule.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
i
don't
think
that
congress
gave
this
part
of
the
problem
that
much
thought.
what
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
provided
for
that
exception
is
the
part
of
the
rule
that
makes
a
plea
of
guilty
later
withdrawn
inadmissible,
so
that
there
will
be
a
record
of
court
proceedings
in
which
the
defendant--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
if
he
pled
guilty
and
in
the
course
of
his
plea
allocution
made
statements
of
fact
that
were
later
proven
to
be
false,
and
he--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--as
the
exception
was
contemplated,
justice
stevens,
it
refers
only
to
a
statement
made
in
court
as
part
of
the
part
of
the
rule
that
makes--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
would
not--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
would
not
normally
cover
his
testimony
at
trial.
it
covers
the...
maybe
i'm
not
explaining
this
well,
justice
stevens,
but
maybe
i
should
back
up.
in
the
context
of
taking
a
plea
of
guilty,
sometimes
the
judge
may,
but
need
not,
place
the
defendant
under
oath
for
his
plea
allocution.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
in
addition
to
making
inadmissible
statements
made
during
plea
discussions
with
the
prosecutor,
this
rule
also
makes
inadmissible
statements
made
in
connection
with
a
plea
of
guilty
that
was
later
withdrawn.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes,
it
does,
and
i'm
not
saying
that
it
should
not.
all
i'm
saying
was,
that
was...
that
the
factual
pattern
that
was
contemplated
was
that
one
that
i
described.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
yes.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
except
that
then
the
evidence
that
would
prove
that
the
trial
testimony
was
false,
justice
stevens,
would
still
likely
be
inadmissible
under
the
strict
reading
of
the
rule,
because
the
statements
made
to
the
prosecutor
were
not
on
the
record,
and
i
think
that
is
the
reading
of
the
rule
that
is
more
or
less
required
by
its
plain
language.
that
is
to
say--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
there
are
many
reasons
for
that.
in
many
of
the
courthouses
in
the
country,
it
would
be
impossible
to
get
a
court
reporter
to
get
to
these
meetings,
so
as
a
practical
matter
it
would
never
be
the
case
that
these--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--justice
stevens--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--if...
if
he--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--and
again,
maybe
it
is
i
who
is
not
explaining
this
very
well,
but
if
he
testifies
as
he
did
here,
we
could
prosecute
him
for
the
perjury
that
he
committed
in
the
courtroom.
the
question
then
would
be
whether,
in
order
to
prove
that
perjury,
the
evidence
of
his
plea
statements
to
the
prosecutor
would
be
admissible.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
it
is
exactly
what
the
purpose
is,
justice
stevens.
it's
not
what
the
rule
says.
it
says
that
the--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
right,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
right,
justice
o'connor,
and
all
i
was
saying
is
that
in
the
usual
case
that
raises
the
facts
that
we
brought
to
this
court,
that
will
not
be
true,
because
these
tend
to
be
meetings
in
the
u.s.
attorney's
offices
where
there
is
not
a
court
reporter,
and
where
the
defendant
is
not
placed
under
oath.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
the
usual
fact
is
that...
i
mean,
in
cases
where
this
ends
up
being
a
problem,
is
that
he
will
say
something
in
his
own
trial
under
oath
that
is
false,
and
will
say
something
in
the
meeting
with
the
prosecutor,
something
else
in
the
meeting
with
the
prosecutor
that
is
false,
but
it
is
true
that
the
situation
that
you
describe
can
come
up
fairly
often,
too,
and
that
is
one
of
our
points.
the
point
of
the
exercise
is
that
we're
asking
him,
or
he's
asking
us
to
come
talk
to
us
for
the
purpose
of
using
him
as
a
witness
for
the
government.
we
have
a
special
concern
about
the
reliability
of
his
statements
and
our
being
able
to
use
them
without
there
being
these
types
of
arguments
when
we're
trying
to
get
through
a
criminal
trial
that
is
designed
to
establish
what
happened.
and
in
a
situation
in
which
he
is
coming
in
in
a
frame
of
mind
such
that
he's
still
contemplating
crimes
of
false
statement,
with
a
false
statement
to
the
prosecutor
or
a
possible
perjury
at
his
own
trial,
he
is
coming
in
in
a
frame
of
mind
that
makes
him...
that
disqualifies
him,
in
effect,
to
be
a
government
witness,
and
i
think--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
not
really
true
as
a
practical
matter,
justice
souter,
for
the
following
reason.
the
rule
could
conceivably
cover
two
class
of
cases,
one
of
which
i
will
call
charge
bargaining,
which
really
doesn't
involve
using
the
defendant
as
a
witness
against
anyone,
and
the
other
one,
which
is
cooperation.
in
the
second
category,
the
answer
is
yes.
in
the
first
category,
it
will
be
a
waste
of
time
for
everyone
involved
even
to
meet
with
the
defendant,
because
charge
bargaining,
which
is
the
usual
type
of
plea
bargaining
that
has
traditionally
been
known
to
this
court,
really
usually
only
involves
the
defense
lawyer
calling
the
prosecutor
on
the
phone
and
arguing
about
what
his
client
did
and
what
he
thinks
an
appropriate
sentence
or
charge
might
be.
and
in
the
first
class,
the
charge
bargaining
class
of
cases,
we
never
ask
for
a
waiver.
we
never
ask
to
meet
with
the
client,
or
hardly
ever,
because
it
would
be
a
waste
of
their
time
and
ours,
and
we
only
do
it
in
cases
that
involve
cooperation,
and
as
to--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
is
not--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
is
not
true
as
a
general
matter
that
in
the
charge
bargaining
situation
the
rule
wouldn't
apply
because
the
lawyer
is
the
agent
of
his
client
for
the
purpose,
and--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--well,
that
generally
would
not
be
the
case,
that
is
true.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
don't
have
any--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--i
don't
have
any
hesitation
in
conceding,
justice
souter,
that
as
to
the
class
of
cases
that
involve
cooperation
we
would
normally
ask
for
a
waiver,
and
that
would
not
be
a
consequence
of
what
happens
in
this
court.
that
is
what
has
been
happening
for
the
last
several
years
all
over
the
country.
the...
as
to
the
charge
bargaining
situation.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
right.
i
mean,
there--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that's
exactly
right,
and
you
can
contemplate
some
potential
witnesses
who
would
have
enough
market
power
to
do
something
like
that.
say,
for
example,
if
the
head
of
the
gambino
crime
family
gets
taken
in
with
his
underling,
sammy
the
bull,
and
the
government
knows
that
in
order
to
put
the
head
of
the
gambino
crime
family
in,
in
jail,
it
will
need
the
testimony
of
the
underboss,
you
can
very
well
think
of
that
person
as
having
a
great
deal
of
bargaining
power.
i
don't
think
even
he
would
ordinarily
think
that
the
waiver
is
that
significant,
but
there
are
in
fact
witnesses
who,
in
the
context
of
an
investigation,
can
be
so
important
that
they
will
be
able
to
haggle
effectively
with
the
government.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
well,
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
i
mean--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
absolutely
right.
most
of
our
cases--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--it
is
always
possible,
justice
stevens,
to
characterize
something
that
is
in
effect
a
personal
right
as
serving
broader
societal
objectives.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
true,
and
it's
a
question
of
the
burden
and
who
should
bear
the
burden
of
showing
that
this
is
that
type
of
rule.
it
is
our
view--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes.
i
mean,
under
our
view,
the
first
and
threshold
question
is
always
whether
the
right
is
intended
to
be
a
personal
one.
and
if
you
take,
for
example,
rule
11,
you
can
read
the
language,
for
example,
of
rule
11(a)
and
compare
it
to
the
language
of
rule
11(e)(6)
which
is
at
issue
here,
and
you
will
see
that
the
language
in
rule
11(a)
is
quite
different,
and
it
imposes
duties
expressly
on
the
court
to
make
sure
that
at
the
time
of
the
guilty
plea
the
defendant
will
be
advised
of
x,
y,
and
z,
and
it
goes
on
to
impose
other
duties
on
the
court
of
that
nature.
and
if
you
look
at
the
background
of
the
rule,
you
understand
that
the
point
of
that
part
of
the
rule
is
to
make
sure
that
a
clear
record
will
be
made
of
a
guilty
plea
so
that
we
can
in
effect
dispose
quickly
and
efficiently
of
baseless
collateral
attacks
later.
so
that
type
of
rule,
which
by
its
terms
and
by
its
policy
is
intended
for
the
protection
of
society
when
society
and
the
criminal
defendant
have
interests
that
are
adverse,
would
be
one
that
would
not
be
waivable.
my
second
example
would
be
the
speedy
trial
act.
the
speedy
trial
right
under
the
sixth
amendment
is
one
that
is
understood
to
be
one
of
the
defendant,
and
waivable
by
him.
during
the
consideration
of
the
speedy
trial
act
of
1974,
however,
it
developed
that
congress
was
principally
concerned
about
the
fact
that
people
were
not
having
trials
quickly
enough
and
were
out
committing
crimes,
and
the
preamble
of
the
speedy
trial
act
describes
it
as
an
act
to,
if
i
may
quote
the
actual
language,
"to
assist
in
reducing
crime
and
the
danger
of
recidivism
by
requiring
speedy
trials.
"
now,
you
then
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
that
act,
and
before
that
act
came
into
full
effect
in
1979,
congress
passed
a
new
statute
that
changed
it
somewhat
significantly,
and
the
committee
report
by
the
senate
expressly
stated
that
in
the
context
of
the
statutory
right
the
interests
of
society
and
the
interest
of
the
criminal
defendant
are
adverse,
because
in
a
memory-dependent
system
it
will
always
be
to
the
defendant's...
or
it
will
often
be
to
the
defendant's
advantage
to
stretch
out
the
length
of
time
that
the
trial
should
take.
it's
the
old
notion
that
a
continuance
is
as
good
as
an
acquittal,
except
that
it
doesn't
last
as
long,
and
it
goes
further
to
say,
in
a
section
entitled
"waiver",
that
because
of
the
strong
public
policy,
as
already
explained,
that
it
is
their
strong
view
that
this
right
should
not
be
waivable.
now,
the
right
of
that
nature,
where
the
purpose
of
the
right
is
to
take
care
of
certain
circumstances
in
which
the
interests
of
society
and
of
the
criminal
defendant
are
adverse,
and
one
of
the
interesting
points
about
the
example
that
i
just
gave
you,
the
speedy
trial
act,
is
that
that
is
one
of
the
examples
in
which
congress
expressly
adverts
to
the
background
rule
and
acknowledges
that
ordinarily
all
rights
are
waivable,
and
it
said
so
in
terms,
and
then
has
a
section
saying,
"waiver",
we
don't
want
this
to
be
waivable.
and
our
point
here
is
that
the
background
rule
in
our
society
is
so
strongly
that,
that
all
rights
are
waivable,
that
when
someone
claims
that
a
particular
one
should
not
be,
or
is
not,
the
burden
is
on
that
person
to
make
some
sort
of
affirmative
showing
based
on
what
is
there
by
way
of
legislative
materials
that
might
show
that.
now,
the
argument
that
has
been
made
here
really
goes
in
two
parts,
one
as
to
the
mandatory
language
of
the
rules,
and
as
to
that
one,
our
basic
answer
is
that
the
structure
of
the
rules
from
their
language
is
no
different
from
the
hearsay
rules,
everyone
knows
that
those
are
waivable.
and
the
second
one
goes
to
the
policy
of
the
rule
to
encourage
candid
communications,
and
our
basic
short
answer
to
that
is
that
that
is
no
different
from
the
rules
that
govern
privileges
for
confidential
communications
under
rule
501,
like
the
attorney-client
privilege,
for
example.
it
is
the
purpose
of
that
rule
to
encourage
candid
communications.
the
rule
is
that
the
statement
can't
be
used
for
any
purpose,
even
for
impeachment.
congress
must
have
contemplated,
therefore,
and
the
courts
must
have
contemplated
that
there
would
be
some
cases
in
which
the
unavailability
of
the
rule
would
lead
to
perjury
being
unrebutted.
but
precisely
because
the
effect
of
the
rule
is
to
keep
evidence
from
the
fact-finder,
the
usual
rule
is
that
they
are
not
construed
broadly,
and
in
fact
no
one
would
con...
excuse
me.
no
one
would
say
that
they
may
not
be
waived.
and
i
see
that
i
have
very
little
time.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
just
a
couple
of
points.
the
first
is
that
congress
did
not
think
about
the
issue
of
waiver,
and
it
is
our
view
here
that,
given
what
the
consequence
of
the
other
side's
view
for
the
truth-finding
process
of
the
trial,
only
the
most
clear
evidence
that
waiver
was
required
to
be
precluded
should
suffice,
because
at
the
end
of
the
day,
what
we're
talking
about
is
a
requirement
that
tells
the
government
that
it
is
required
to
sit
on
its
hands
and
let
perjury
go
unrebutted
while
it
knows
that
it's
going
on,
and
where
evidence
could
come
in
in
accordance
with
the
freely
given
waiver
that
could
tell
the
jury
that
this
is
a
person
who
has
given
inconsistent
statements
on
the
very
same
issue
that
they
have
to
make
judgment
on.
congress
did
not
think
about
the
separate,
legal
concept
of
waiver.
there
are
cases
in
which
congress
has
thought
about
it
and
has
done
something
about
it
in
the
text
of
the
statute,
or
the
legislative
history,
and
the
result
being
urged
here--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--that
is
right,
justice
stevens--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--yes...
well,
no,
not
acceptable,
justice
stevens.
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
congress
thought
that
in
many
circumstances
this
was
an
endurable
cost
to
bring
parties
to
the
bargaining
table.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
it
didn't
view
it
as
an
affirmative
good--
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
--there
was
a
goal
of
the
rule,
and
there
are
many
other
rules,
like
the
rules
i
mentioned
earlier
governing
testimonial
privileges,
that
go
on
the
same
assumption,
yet
precisely
because
it
is
recognized
that
they
hinder
the
truth-finding
function
of
the
trial,
no
one
would
say
that
they
are
not
waivable.
and
again,
there
is
a
difference
between
saying
that
congress
thought
that
this
might
be
an
acceptable
cost
in
some
contexts,
and
saying
that
congress
would
have
required...
required
the
prosecutor
to
let
perjury
go
unrebutted
when
the
defendant
and
his
lawyer
both
felt
themselves
free
to
negotiate
freely
and
openly
with
the
government
without
the
backstop
provided
by
the
rule.
mr.
miguel
a.
estrada
that
is
right.
i
mean,
we
do
not
argue
that
the
rule
has
an
impeachment
exception.
we
recognize
that
congress
in
effect
said
that
that
would
be
an
acceptable
cost
in
some
contexts.
our
position
here
is
to
urge
that
congress
did
not
view
that
as
an
affirmative
good
that
had
to
be
accomplished
by
the
rule,
and
that
unless...
and
that,
given
that
congress
recognized
it
as
a
cost,
and
as
something
that
was
bad
that
could
be
brought
by
the
rule,
only
the
most
clear
evidence
of
congressional
intent
to
displace
a
well-settled
background
doctrine
should
result
in
a
judgment
that
waiver
is
not
allowed,
and
that
evidence
has
not
been
furnished
here.
thank
you.
