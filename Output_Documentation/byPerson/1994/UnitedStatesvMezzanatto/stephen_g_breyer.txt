mr.
lippman,
suppose
the
government
doesn't
get
a
waiver
in
the
negotiations,
and
they
enter
into
discussions
for
cooperation,
then
later
at
the
trial,
despite
its
not
having
gotten
a
prior
waiver,
the
government
introduces
evidence
of
what
was
said
in
those
discussions,
and
there's
no
objection
on
the
part
of
counsel
and
a
conviction
occurs,
is
that
reversible
error?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
think
it
can't
be
done
prior,
but
can
be
done
at
the
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
other
example
of...
well,
look,
as
i
look
through
rule
11(e),
it
seems
like
most
of
it
tells
judges
what
they
are
supposed
to
do,
and
it
seems
aimed
at
protecting...
at
courts.
the
courts
are
supposed
to
behave,
to
make...
in
a
certain
way
to
make
certain
that
what...
this
court-imposed
function
normally
is
fair.
but
that
particular
section
doesn't
really
have
to
do
with
courts,
it
has
to
do
with
the
parties,
and
if
it
isn't
for
the
parties,
i
don't
know
who
it's
for.
it's
certainly
not
for
the
courts.
so
can
you
think
of
any
other
instance
where
you
have
rules
of
evidence
that
seemed
aimed
at
the
parties,
where
it's
not
waivable?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can
understand
not
waiving
things
that
have
to
do
with
courts,
which
have
to
do
with
how
the
court
is
supposed
to
behave.
is
there
any
instance
where
you
could
look
and
see,
this
has
to
do,
really
this
rule
here
is
here
for
the
protection
of
the
parties,
one
or
the
other
or
both?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
any
rule,
a
rule
of
evidence,
a
rule...
a
rule
of
admissibility.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
rule
of
admissibility
in
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
any
rule
that
has
to
do
with
evidence.
any
rule
that
seems,
you
know,
somewhat
closely
analogous.
or,
i'll
put
down
flsa.
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--right.
any
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
waived
every
day
of
the
week,
aren't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i've
handled
dozens
of
cases,
and
we
have
hearsay
coming
in
all
the
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
we
mean
is,
basically,
i've
seen
an
awful
lot
of
transcripts,
spouses
testify,
doctors
testify,
hearsay
of
all
kinds
comes
in,
documents
come
in
that
don't
correspond
with
authentication
rules,
that
happens
in
trial
after
trial
after
trial,
and
nobody
objects,
and
they're
properly
admitted
because
nobody
objected,
and
what
we
want
to
know
is,
is
there
anything
different
about
this?
i
mean,
if
parties
can
do
that,
why
can't
they
do
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
never
seen
this
difference.
i
just
read
the
transcript,
and
when
i
read
the
transcript
it's
not
objected
to,
so
that's
the
end
of
that
point.
i
mean,
that's
the
normal--
