do
you
have
the--
--another
problem
is
also
that
the...
i
thought
the
usual
situation
is
not
that
he
tells
the
truth
during
the
settlement
negotiations,
or
plea
bargaining,
and
lies
at
the
trial,
it's
the
opposite.
he
lies
during
the
session
where
he's
cooperating
with
you,
supposedly,
and
then
later,
when
the
defendant
that
you
use
his
evidence
against
is
put
on
trial,
he
tells
the
truth.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
then
i...
i'm
sorry.
go
on.
no,
you...
i've
already
had
some.
i
suppose
you
could
say
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
jury
trial
has
been
swallowed
up
by
the
exception
as
well.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
whole
point
is
that
you
have
the
right,
but
it's
a
right
that's
yours
and
if
you
want
to
give
it
away,
you
may,
and
if
in
fact
most
people
choose
to,
that's
just
the
way--
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying,
nothing,
nothing
can
be
waived
unless
the
provision,
whether
it
be
a
statute
or
a
rule,
contains
a
phrase
such
as,
absent
agreement?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
all
rules
have
some
public
function,
i
assume,
if
only
to
assure
a
just
outcome
to
the
trial.
i
mean,
that's
a
public
function.
every
rule
contributes
to
that,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
your
distinction
and
agree
with
it,
between
forfeiture
and
waiver,
but
your
position
is
that
this
rule,
like
most
of
the
rules,
cannot
be
waived,
and
the
hearsay
rule
is
also
one
that
can't
be
waived.
so
i
guess
it
would
be
your
position
that
if
in
the
course
of
a
trial
such
as
justice
ginsburg
described,
counsel,
whenever
evidence
was
introduced
the
judge
looks
at
counsel
for
the
defendant
and
says,
you're
making
no
objection
to
the
introduction
of
this
hearsay
evidence,
and
the
defendant's
counsel
says,
no,
your
honor,
we
want
the
jury
to
hear
all
the
truth,
that
is
error,
then,
for
the
judge
to
admit
it,
even
though
both
sides
want
it
to
come
in,
because
under
your
view
the
hearsay...
hearsay
is
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
wouldn't
depend
on
the
context.
i
mean,
if
the
hearsay
rule
is
being
violated,
and
the
only
reason
it's
not
being
violated
is
that
both
parties
want
this
evidence
to
come
in,
you
would
say
that
a
good
trial
judge
would
exclude
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
has
been
no
prior
stipulation.
i
mean,
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
right
at
the
very
time.
he
looks
at
counsel...
and
so
you
can't
run
your
argument
that
stipulations
are
something
different,
an
argument
i
don't
really
understand,
but
that
is
not
applicable,
assume.
it
just
happens,
just
like
that.
you'd
say
that
the
trial
judge
must
exclude
it
because
the
hearsay
rule,
like
most
of
the
rules,
is
simply
not
waivable.
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
disagree
with
his
question.
you
don't
agree
that
it's
all
properly
admitted.
your
position
is,
it
is
improperly
admitted.
even
when
nobody
objects,
it's
improperly
admitted.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
get
away
with
it
only
because
there's
been
forfeiture
on
appeal,
but
we're
running
just
a
whole
lot
of
trials
out
there
every
day
that
are
just
in
violation
of
statutes
that
congress
has
passed.
unfortunately,
nobody
can
review
them
because
they
forfeited
it.
we
just
have
a
lot
of
lazy
judges
who
do
not
stop
these
violations
of
law
that
occur
every
day.
it's
a
terrible
prospect.
i
hate
to
think.
[laughter]
