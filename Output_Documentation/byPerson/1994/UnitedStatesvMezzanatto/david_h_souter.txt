justice
david
h.
souter
but
of
course
the
difference
is
they
don't
waive
the
rule
before
they've
committed
the
crime,
and
here,
the...
you're
asking
for
the
waiver
before
presumably...
the
government
is
asking
for
the
waiver
presumably
before
the
misstatement
is
made,
and
before
the
defendant
is
faced
with,
in
effect,
deciding
whether
to
accept
the
consequence
of
the
waiver.
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
that
shouldn't
make
a
difference,
but
it
is
a
difference.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
the
consequence
of
this,
mr.
estrada,
going
to
be
that,
at
least
so
far
as
the
use
of
the
statements
for
impeachment...
perhaps
not
as
far
as
justice
kennedy's
hypothesis
suggested,
but
so
far
as
the
use
of
the
statement
for
impeachment
is
concerned,
that
if
you
prevail,
there
really
will
never
be
any
application
of
the
rule
to
exclude
a
statement?
i
mean,
the
exception...
the
waiver
exception,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
is
going
to
become
the
rule,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean,
you're
in
effect
saying
the
rule
doesn't
apply
in
the
charge
bargaining
situation
simply
because
the
defendant
isn't
there,
and
what
you're...
if
i
understand
you,
what
you're
saying
is
that
in
cases
in
which
the
defendant
is
there
and
is
talking,
as
a
practical
matter,
if
this
exception
is
allowed,
the
exception
will
swallow
the
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
or
become
the
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
not
going
to
impeach
the
client
later
on
based
on
the
word
of
his
lawyer.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
so...
but
i
mean,
in
any
case
in
which
the
client,
the
defendant,
is
going
to
be
in
front
of
the
state's
agent
making
statements
in
a
bargaining
process,
it's
going
to
be
the
second...
by
definition,
it's
going
to
be
the
second
of
the
two
examples
that
you
give,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
government
is
always,
if
this
is
allowed,
going
to
insist,
and,
as
justice
kennedy
said,
make
it
a
part
of
the
standard
government
form--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
in
talking
to
us
you
waive
inadmissibility
protection,
however
they
phrase
it,
of
rule
410.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that's
going
to
be
the
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
may
not
be
what
congress
wanted.
mr.
estrada,
i
suppose
if
the
government
insisted...
insists
on
waivers
in
the
witness,
potential
witness,
what
you'd
refer
to
as
the
same...
and
the
potential
witnesses
simply
refused
to
agree
to
the
waivers,
then
the
government
might
change
its
position,
and
in
some
cases
it
would
not
want...
it
could
not
have
the
waiver
because
the
defendant
wouldn't
agree
to
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
one
response
to
the
continuum
argument
i
suppose
is
mr.
estrada's
response,
and
that
is,
if
you
assume
that
the
public
function
is
to
facilitate,
indeed
to
promote,
plea
bargaining,
this,
the
so-called
waiver
rule
that
he
wants
is
going
to
have
no
effect
in
most
plea
bargaining
situations
at
all,
because
a
plea
bargain
is
normally
simply
a
deal
which
is
made
between
a
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel,
and
the
first
time
the
defendant
has
anything
to
say
is
when
he
stands
in
front
of
the
court
and
answers
the
questions
about
factual
basis,
and
so
on.
so
that
if
we
assume
the
public
function
here
is
the
facilitation
of
plea
bargaining,
then
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
any
threat
to
that
in
the
government's
position.
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
mr.
estrada's
point
is
that
plea
discussions
normally
just
don't
even
implicate
the
rule.
do
you
think
he
is
factually
mistaken?
