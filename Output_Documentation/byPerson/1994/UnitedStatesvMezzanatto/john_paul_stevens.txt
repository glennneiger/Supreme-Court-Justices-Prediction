justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that--
--doesn't...
go
ahead.
but
doesn't
the
statute
take
care
of
that
by
saying
that
it
preserves
the
right
to
prosecute
him
for
perjury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it
this
defendant
could
be
prosecuted
for
perjury,
under
your
view
of
the
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
couldn't
be
prosecuted
for
perjury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
the
statement
for
which
he'd
be
prosecuted
would
be
his
trial
testimony,
which
would
have
been
made
under
oath.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
have
these
people
take
an
oath
when
they
talk
to
you,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
do
make
a
record,
don't
you,
of
your
interviews?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
think
that
subparagraph
(ii)
contemplates?
doesn't
it
contemplate
that
these
statements
would
be
made
by
the
defendant
under
oath,
on
the
record,
and
in
the
presence
of
counsel?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
couldn't
be
prosecuted
for
perjury
for
pleading
guilty.
i
mean,
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
you
don't...
i
see,
you
think
this
starts...
well,
which
does
this
refer
to,
trial
proceedings,
or
the
proceedings
in
the
plea
bargain,
in
your
view,
subparagraph
(ii)
of
the
rule,
little
(ii),
where
it
says
in
(i)
of
the...
such
statement
is
admissible
to,
(i)
in
the...
where,
to
clarify
it...
and
(ii)
is,
in
a
criminal
proceeding
for
perjury
or
false
statement
if
the
statement
was
made
by
the
defendant
under
oath,
on
the
record,
and
in
the
presence
of
counsel.
now,
is
that
referring
to
a
statement
in
the
plea
bargaining
discussion
or
a
statement
in
the
later
court
proceeding,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right,
so
that
if
he
then
testifies
falsely
in
court
later
on,
you
can
indict
him
for
perjury,
and
prove
the
perjury
by
what
he
said
at
the
interview.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
this
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
rule
11
proceedings...
that's
subparagraph
(iii),
but
the
however
language
at
the
end
of
the
rule
with
the
two
subparagraphs
in
it
refer
back
to
all
four--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you'd
think
it
was
primarily
intended
to
refer
to
the
rule
11
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
surely
doesn't
say
that,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
would
protect
the
government's
right
to
prosecute
for
perjury
if
there's
a
conflict
between
trial
testimony
and
the
testimony
in
the
plea
bargain
discussion.
if
you
tell
me
that's
not
your
understanding,
then--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
may
be,
but
the
language
of
subparagraph
(ii),
prosecution
for
perjury
or
false
statement
if
the
statement
was
made
by
the
defendant
under
oath,
that
sounds
to
me
like
the
statement...
the
later
statement
in
court.
i'll
accept
your...
you
say
that's
what
it
means.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can't
use
the
statute
for
that
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
surprises
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
would
argue
it
would
be,
would
you
not?
you
wouldn't
concede
that
evidence
as
inadmissible.
that's
exactly
what
the
purpose
of
subparagraph
(ii)
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
estrada,
isn't
that
really
the
issue
here?
you
describe
the
rule
as
one
for
the
special
protection
of
the
defendant,
but
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
viewed
the
rule.
they
thought
it
had
a
public
purpose
beyond
the
protection
of
the
defendant.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
also
possible
to
characterize
a
rule
that
is
designed
to
provide...
serve
a
broad
social
interest
in
encouraging
plea
bargaining
and
disposing
of
lots
of
criminal
cases,
you
can
characterize
such
a
rule
as
nothing
more
than
protection
of
a
personal
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
your
correct
response
that
we
don't
know
how
many
cases
there
are
without
lawyers
and
how
many
with
the
defendant
there,
but
whatever
the
number,
congress
obviously
thought
it
sufficient
to
justify
the
promulgation
of
a
rule
dealing
with
that
category
of
cases,
however
big
it
is,
whether
it's
10
people
or
10
million?
congress
thought
there
ought
to
be
a
special
provision
for
that
category
of
cases,
so
why
should
we
debate
how
many
of
them
there
are?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
stipulate
to
that?
[laughter]
but
does
the
number
of
them
and
the
relative
character
of
these
bargaining
sessions
nonetheless
have
an
effect
on
what
we
should
infer
about
congress'
intent
on
waivability,
because
if
in
fact
in
the
characteristic
situation
which
there
would
be
a
waiver,
there
probably
will
indeed
be
a
really
extensive
bargaining
going
on...
i
mean,
something
more
than
just
a
plea
for
a
sentence...
and
counsel
will
be
there
on
each
side,
and
so
on.
isn't
it
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
defendant
is
likely
to
be
in
a
position
to
make
an
intelligent
waiver,
if
he
makes
one,
on
the
theory
that
he's
really
going
to
get
something
in
return
for
it,
something
important
to
him,
and
if
we
assume
that
is
going
to
be
the
characteristic
context,
wouldn't
that
be
a
good
reason
to
conclude
that
congress
probably
did
not
intend
this
rule
to
be
proof
against
waiver
if
a
defendant
really
waives?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
clear
on
one
thing,
though,
mr.
estrada.
it
is
clear
if
there
were
no
waiver,
then
the
prosecutor
would
have
to
sit
there
and
let
the
perjury
go
unrebutted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
congress
thought
that
was
acceptable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
an
acceptable
cost.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
do
get...
the
mere
fact
of
perjury
and
dishonesty
and
all
the
rest
of
it
is
not
sufficient
unless
there's
a
waiver
to
adduce
as
for
impeachment
purposes.
