well,
we
disagree
on
that.
well,
i
guess
it's
inadmissible
unless
it
was
made
under
oath
on
the
record
and
in
the
presence
of
counsel.
justice

o'connor
and
if
it
was...
if
those
three
things
are
met,
then
yes,
it's
admissible
in
the
subsequent
perjury.
justice
sandra

o'connor
you
know,
i'm
a
little
confused
by
your
continual
reference
to
olano
and
justice
kennedy's
opinion,
because
with
all
respect
to
justice
kennedy,
that
wasn't
the
opinion
of
the
court,
was
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
a
rather
lonely
concurrence.
it
was
different,
was
it
not?
