chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-1340,
united
states
v.
gary
mezzanatto.
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that's
because
you
say
it's
customary
for
prosecutors
not
to
put
a
defendant
under
oath
and
not
to
make
a
record
such
as
is
spoken
of
in
(ii)?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
estrada.
mr.
lippman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
a
stipulation
that
something
be
admitted
in
evidence,
not
stipulating
as
to
provable
fact,
but
just
stipulating
as
to
particular
testimony
or
a
document
being
admitted
into
evidence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
has
nothing...
i
would
think
a
stipulation
as
to
admissibility
of
evidence
has
nothing
to
do
with
a
fact
that's
not
material.
the
fact...
a
disputed
fact
may
be
very
material.
all
they're
saying
is
that
this
particular
piece
of
evidence
we
stipulate
is
admissible.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
agree
with
you
on
that.
i
think
sometimes
when
you're
getting
ready
to
mark
exhibits
for
a
trial,
i've
got
some
that
may
be
questionable,
and
i
say,
you
stipulate
to
the
admissibility
of
these,
and
you've
got
some
that
may
be
questionable,
i'll
stipulate
to
the
admissibility
of
those.
it's
not
necessarily
agreement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
kind
i
entered
into
were
improper,
actually.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
there
are
two...
that's
a
dichotomy,
in
your
view?
a
rule
which
confers
a
personal
right
is
one
thing,
and
a
rule
which
has
a
public
function
is
another?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
can--
--don't
continue
before
you
answer
this
question.
[laughter]
for
instance...
you
say,
for
instance,
the
fifth
amendment
and
the
sixth
amendment,
the
guarantee
of
jury
trial,
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
don't...
they
don't...
they
serve
no
public
function.
they
just
confer
kind
of
an
individual
benefit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
by
failing
to
object
to
hearsay--
--yes,
right.
--you
waive
your
objection.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
somehow
give
up,
whatever
you
want
to
say.
what's
the
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--is
the
omission
of
hearsay
improper
if
it's
not
objected
to?
i
mean,
that's
kind
of--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
you
don't
understand
the
answer.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lippman.
mr.
estrada,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
estrada.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
93-1340
united
states
versus
mezzanatto
will
be
announced
by
justice
thomas.
