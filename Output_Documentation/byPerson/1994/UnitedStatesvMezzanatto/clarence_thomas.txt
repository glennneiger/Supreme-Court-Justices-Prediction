justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
after
respondent
was
charged
with
possession
of
methamphetamine
with
intent
to
distribute,
he
and
his
attorney
asked
to
meet
with
the
prosecutor
to
discuss
the
possibility
of
cooperating
with
the
government.
the
prosecutor
agreed
to
meet
the
respondent
but
on
the
condition
that
respondent?s
statements
could
be
used
to
impeach
in
the
contradictory
testimony
he
might
give
a
trial
if
the
case
proceeded
that
far.
respondent
conferred
with
his
attorney
and
agreed
to
the
prosecutor?s
terms.
the
pre-discussions
were
ultimately
unsuccessful
and
respondent
testified
a
trial
on
his
own
behalf
when
respondent
contradicted
statements
he
made
to
the
prosecutor
the
government
introduced
his
plea
statements
to
impeach
him.
respondent
objected
on
the
ground
that
statements
made
during
plea
negotiations
are
inadmissible
under
federal
rule
of
evidence
410
and
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
11(e)(6).
the
district
court
overruled
respondent?s
objection
but
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
respondent?s
agreement
was
unenforceable.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today
we
now
reverse.
the
plea
statement
rule
says
nothing
about
waiver,
but
this
does
not
foreclose
voluntary
wavier
agreements.
the
rules
must
be
read
against
the
background
presumption
that
legal
rights
generally
and
evidentiary
provisions
specifically
are
subject
to
waiver.
respondent
there
has
a
burden
of
identifying
some
affirmative
basis
for
concluding
that
the
plea
statement
rules
depart
from
the
presumption
of
waivability.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
has
joined.
