justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
in
your
view
the
government,
as
part
of
its
standard
plea
bargain
form,
asks
the
defendant
to
waive
its...
his
right
not
to
have
the
testimony
used
in
the
government's
case
on
direct,
for
all
purposes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
suppose
he
really
wanted
a
plea
bargain
discussion
and
the
government
says,
now,
one
of
the
things
you
are
waiving
here
is
your
self-incrimination
privilege.
we're
going
to
play
a
cassette
recording
of
this
entire
plea
bargain
to
the
jury,
of
the
plea
bargain
discussion
to
the
jury
if
the
plea
bargain
doesn't
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
until
the
speedy
trial
statute
that
mr.
estrada
quoted
was
enacted,
the
speedy
trial
had
always
been
waivable.
that
was
bedrock
jurisprudence
of
this
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
act--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
act
specifically
so
provides.
that
was
his
whole
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
justice
souter
can
protect
his
own
question,
but
i'm
interested
in
the
same
point,
because
frankly
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
until
i
heard
the
government's
argument.
he
says,
look,
plea
bargains
go
on
all
the
time,
and
they're
not
under
this
procedure.
they're
not
in
a
context
in
which
the
defendant
is
present
with
his
counsel
making
statements
to
the
united
states
attorney.
that
context
is
reserved
for
questions
when
they
want
the
witness'
cooperation
both
by
disclosing
information
that
he
knows
so
that
they
can
have
further
investigation,
number
1,
and
number
2
so
that
they
can
use
his
testimony
at
trial,
so
that
the
plea
bargaining
you're
talking
about
is
just
not
really
affected
in
most
cases
by
this
rule.
and
justice
souter
is
asking,
in
your
experience
in
the
criminal
system,
is
that
generally
correct?
