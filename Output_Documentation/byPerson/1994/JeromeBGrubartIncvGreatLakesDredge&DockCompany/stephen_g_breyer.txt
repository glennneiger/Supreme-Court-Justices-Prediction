justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
do
have
a
question,
actually.
why?
my
question
is
why?
you
say,
do
this
very
finely,
but
look,
why
do
it
finely?
why
not
do
it
crudely?
and
my...
to
show
you
what
i'm
thinking,
sometimes
admiralty
jurisdiction
will
hurt
plaintiffs
like
your
client.
of
course,
it
does,
because
they
get
less
money.
sometimes,
it
will
help
plaintiffs.
sometimes
it
will
hurt
defendants.
sometimes
it
will
hurt
little
people.
sometimes
it
will
help
little
people.
i
don't
know
how
it
works
out
in
balance,
but
i'm...
so
i
take
that
out
of
my
mind.
but
i'm
reasonably
certain
what
does
hurt
people
is
litigating
costs,
and
here,
as
in
this
case,
you
spend
an
awful
lot
of
money
because
there
isn't
a
clear
test.
so
my
question
is,
why
not
have
a
clear
test?
that
will
help
everybody.
and
i
don't
know
how
it
works
out
in
the
wash,
you
know,
between...
but
at
least
it
will
help
people
by
making
the
jurisdictional
thing
clear,
and
therefore
let's
go
crude.
let's
say,
for
example,
if
it's
a
vessel,
and
it's
in
the
water,
that's
the
end
of
it...
admiralty.
and
maybe
it's
a
meteor,
it's
not
really
a
vessel,
or
an
airplane.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but...
in
other...
but
don't
answer
the
specific.
what
i'm
interested
in,
as
a
practical
matter,
if
you're
trying
to...
as
a
practical
matter,
what's
wrong
with
having
a
fairly
crude,
simple
test
that
at
least
will
tell
lawyers
what
court
they're
supposed
to
file
their
paper
in?
