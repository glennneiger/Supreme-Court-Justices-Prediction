mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
today,
the
court
is
asked
to
extend
admiralty
jurisdiction
beyond
its
historic
boundaries,
the
shore
and
property
abutting
the
shore,
and
bring
it
into
the
basements
of
downtown
chicago.
while
we
think
it
extraordinary
that
there
should
be
federal
admiralty
jurisdiction
over
water
in
the
basement
of
marshall
fields,
that
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
managed
to
hold,
and
this
morning
i
will
press
two
points
with
respect
to
that
holding.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
our
view
is
that
that
would
be
an
admiralty
case.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
that
would
be.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
well,
i
think
it
quite
important
to
start
by
identifying
the
cause
of
action
with
considerable
precision,
because
the
cause
of
action
in
this
case
is
not
how
a
boat
was
spudded
down
on
navigable
water,
or
anything
having
to
do
with
navigation
or
seaworthiness.
the
cause
of
action
here,
to
be
precise,
is
an
alleged
lack
of
due
care,
when
driving
pilings
through
subsoil,
for
underground
tunnels
in
the
area,
a
cause
of
action
that
didn't
arise
on
the
water,
in
the
water,
it
actually
arose
15
feet
underneath
the
bed
of
the
river.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
it
did.
it
did,
but
the
cause
of
action,
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
garden-variety
construction,
tort
litigation,
if
the
cause
of
action
is
that
when
you're
going
through
soil,
whether
it's
underneath
a
river
or
not,
you
are
supposed
to
exercise
due
care
with
respect
to
underground
structures.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
it
could
well
be
maritime.
it
depends,
i
think--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
we
have,
for
example,
the
rodrigue
case--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
justice
scalia,
rodrigue,
for
example,
involved
somebody
on
an
oil
derrick
who
was
injured
by
defective
construction
equipment.
that
person
was
on
navigable
water
in
an
oil
rig.
nevertheless,
that
was
held
not
to
be
within
admiralty
because
there
was
no
federal
maritime
interest
in
adjudicating
cases
about
defective
construction
equipment,
and
that's
why
i
urge
the
court
to
define
the
cause
of
action
with
some
precision.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
well,
in
our
view...
actually
i
think
it
has
been
clear
since
1942
that
workers
not
engaged
in
maritime
activities,
and
the
1972
amendments
to
the
act
confirm
this,
are
not
within
admiralty,
so--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
justice
kennedy,
but
a
court
would
look
to
a
nexus
inquiry,
if
you
will.
is
the
activity
that
those
workers
were
engaged
in
maritime
in
character?
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
they
could
well.
i
am
willing
to
concede,
for
present
purposes,
that
that
cause
of
action
might
be
within
admiralty.
in
fact,
more
generally,
let
me
concede
there
are
many
causes
of
action
that
could
arise
from
pile-driving
on
navigable
water
that
would
be
within
admiralty
and,
justice
kennedy,
that
could
well
be
one,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
every
cause
of
action--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--the
city
was
responsible
in
this
case
for
maintaining
the
pilings
that
were
near
the
river,
and
that
in
some
sense
is
maintaining
the
river
with
respect
to
navigability.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
it
absolutely...
if
the
cause
of
action
were
that
the
city
permitted
pilings
to
be
negligently
placed
in
a
navigable
channel
where
they
could
injure
boats,
that
would
absolutely
be
an
admiralty
case.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
it
would,
and
that's
why
we
think
the
sisson
test
should
not
be
used
in
a
case
like
this,
because
most
fundamentally,
unlike
sisson,
this
involves
a
case
of
injury
on
land
to
nonmaritime
parties,
grubart,
the
shoe
store
and
the
other
case--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--and
the--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
but
the
extension
act
uses
a
phrase,
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction,
which
the
court
has
construed
to
require
a
nexus
to
federal
maritime
interests
and--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
but
i
think
it's
most
instructive
to
look
at
the
askew
and
huron
portland
cement
cases.
those
were
vessels
engaged
in
navigation
alleged
to
have
done
injury
on
the
shore,
and
yet
in
both
those
cases
the
court
held
that
that
was
not
within
admiralty
jurisdiction
because
the
federal
interests
in
adjudicating
that
cause
of
action
were
quite
slight.
the
state
interests
in
protecting
the
coast
or
inland
property
were
quite
substantial,
and--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--that's
correct.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
that's
correct,
and--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--that's
why--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--that's
why
we
urge
the
court
to
define
the
cause
of
action
with
precision,
because,
of
course,
the
cause
of
action
is
not
putting
the
pilings
in
a
place
where
they
interfered
with
navigation.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
only
because
of
their
proximity
to
an
underground
tunnel.
that
issue,
how
you
take
care
for
underground
structures,
is
the
same
whether
one
is
driving
pilings
on
land
or
water.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
i
quite
agree,
but
because
this
case
is
all
about
preempting
the
rights
of
land-based
parties.
after
all,
that's
why
great
lakes
invokes
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
if
the
cause
of
action...
if
there
is
an
interest
in
federal
adjudication
of
the
cause
of
action,
such
as
a
navigational
error,
then
all
injuries
should
be
in
federal
court,
land
and
sea,
but
if
there
is
no
federal
interest
in
a
federal
adjudication
of
the
cause
of
action,
then
we
submit
that,
just
like
any
other
preemption
case
in
which
the
court
looks...
as
it
does
when
it
asks
whether
state
causes
of
action
are
preempted
by
federal
law,
it
looks
and
says,
on
this
cause
of
action,
is
there
a
federal
interest
that--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--well,
sisson
did
not
say
ignore
the
complaint,
who
has
sued,
but
we
do
agree
that
sisson
says,
and
this
is
why
we
think
sisson
is
ill
suited
for
this
case,
don't
look
to
the
effects
that
are
alleged
to
have
followed
from
the
action.
we
think
in
a
case
where
what
is
going
on
is
preemption
of
rights
ordinarily
governed
by
state
law,
the
rights
of
land-based
parties,
there
should
be
present
a
federal
interest
sufficiently
weighty
to
justify
federal
adjudication.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
no.
but,
of
course,
in
most
cases
you
have
parties
that
are
engaged
in
maritime
activities
and
not
presumptively
governed
by
state
law.
in
victory
carriers,
for
example,
an
extension
act
case,
the
court
began
its
analysis
by
saying,
the
rights
of
land-based
parties
are
presumptively
governed
by
state
law,
and
we
should
proceed
with
caution,
because
of
the
risk
of
preemption.
i
urge
the
court
to
exercise
the
same
caution
in
this
context.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
i
urge
the
same
kind
of
analysis
the
court
uses
when
it
asks,
is
a
state
tort
cause
of
action
preempted
by
federal
law,
as
in
cipollone.
look
at
the
cause
of
action
and
the
relevant
interests.
here,
i
suggest,
there
is
no
federal
interest
in
adjudicating
this
cause
of
action
sufficient
to
bring
admiralty
jurisdiction
into
downtown
basements.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
well,
i
am
urging,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
an
analysis
just
like
cipollone
or
the
other
cases,
which
we
know
is
a
jurisdictional
analysis.
if
state
courts
jurisdiction
can
be
governed
by
conventional
preemption
analysis,
then
here,
where
you
have
land-based
parties
presumptively
governed
by
state
law
and
within
the
authority
of
the
states,
where
there
are
legitimate
state
interests
in
being
able
to
adjudicate
liability
for
injury
to
person
or
property
on
land,
that
should
also
be
analyzed.
is
the
federal
interest
in
navigation
and
seaworthiness
implicated?
with
the
court's
permission,
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
well--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--preemption
analysis
like
cipollone
has
been
fully
workable
in
the
lower
courts.
this
court
has
not
found
preemption
analysis
too
crude
when
it
comes
to
a
question
whether
a
state
court
still
has
jurisdiction,
and
there
are
legitimate
state
interests
in
being
able
to
adjudicate
liability
for
injury
to
person
or
property
on
land
that
do
deserve
consideration.
thank
you.
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
mr.
roberts
discussed
many
causes
of
action
except
the
one
that
is
actually
before
the
court,
because
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
court
is
asked
to
put
any
cause
of
action
arising
further
inland
than
the
reach
of
the
vessel
and
its
appurtenances
into
admiralty.
the
extension
act
does
not
put
every
cause
of
action
arising
from
ship-to-shore
injury
into
admiralty.
huron
portland
cement
and
askew
would
have
to
be
overruled,
and
there
would
be
serious
constitutional
questions
about
the
validity
of
the
extension
act
if
no
nexus
to
federal
interests
in
maritime
commerce
were
required.
we
read
the
extension
act
as
it
was
read
in
the
askew
case
to
require
a
preemption-based
analysis.
there
is,
indeed,
no
such
thing
as
an
admiralty
case
that
does
not
provide
for
the
displacement
of
state
law
with
federal
law.
as
this
court
said
in
the
east
river
steamship
case,
with
admiralty
jurisdiction
comes
the
application
of
substantive
maritime
law.
admiralty
jurisdiction
is--
mr.
lawrence
rosenthal
--that's
correct,
and
it's
up
to
federal
district
courts,
not
state
legislatures,
to
decide
what
rule,
and
whenever
there
is
an
applicable
federal
rule,
that
federal
rule
will
always
trump
state
law.
that
is
why
i
say,
justice
scalia,
admiralty
jurisdiction
is
inherently
preempted,
and
the
test
we
urge
is
the
preemption
test
this
court
already
uses
when
it
asks
whether
state
courts
have
lost
jurisdiction.
thank
you.
