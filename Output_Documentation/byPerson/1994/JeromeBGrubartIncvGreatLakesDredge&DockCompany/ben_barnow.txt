mr.
ben
barnow
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
furtherance
of
the
divided
argument,
i
intend
on
concentrating
on
nonpreemption
argument
issues.
mr.
rosenthal
intends
on
concentrating
on
the
city's
preemption
argument.
on
april
13,
1992,
the
chicago
loop
flooded.
thousands
of
persons
and
businesses
suffered
losses
estimated
upwards
of
$1
billion.
this
catastrophe,
which
has
now
come
to
be
known
as
the
chicago
flood,
resulted
from
two
occurrences.
one
was
the
city
of
chicago's
failure
to
maintain
or
repair
an
extensive
underground
tunnel
system
under
the
city
of
chicago.
the
second
was
the
pile-driving
activities
which
occurred
on
the
north
branch
of
the
chicago
river
to
protect
the
kinzie
street
bridge,
which
had
been
completed
more
than
6
months
earlier.
the
pile-driving
work
was
performed
by
great
lakes
dredge
&
dock
company,
the
respondent
here.
it
accomplished
this
work
using
a
tractor
crane
positioned
on
top
of
a
spud
scow
which
had
been
posted
into
the
river
bed
and
which
was
being
used
as
a
stationary
platform.
on
these
facts,
the
seventh
circuit,
in
reversing
the
district
court,
found
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
existed.
in
order
to
accomplish
this,
it
had
to
do
two
things:
1)
acting
alone
from
the
other
circuits
which
have
considered
similar
situations,
it
refused
to
adopt
or
use
the
totality-of-the-circumstances
approach.
secondly,
it
misapplied
the
rulings
of
this
court.
it
did
that
by
misconstruing
every
ingredient
that
this
court
indicated
in
sisson
and
the
cases
before
it,
executive
jet,
and
foremost
required.
mr.
ben
barnow
not
the
way
i
read
it.
in
footnote
numbers
3
and
4,
the
court
recognizes
that
the
circuits
were
employing
the
totality-of-the-circumstances
test
and
suggested
that
at
least
for
that
case
that
the
guidance
formula
of
sisson
would
be
adequate
guidance.
it
never
said
that
no
other
circuit
could
continue
to
use
that.
however,
even
if
it
did
for
the
facts
of
that
particular
case,
where
all
of
the
activities
were
uniform,
were
the
same,
it
left
open
the
door
as
to
what
the
case
would
be
where
the
instrumentalities
were
involved
in
different
activities.
i
would
offer
to
the
court
that
in
this
particular
case,
we
have
myriad
activities.
the
city
of
chicago
alone
is
engaged
in
at
least
two
nonmaritime
activities.
one
is
the
construction
or
maintenance
of
a
bridge.
the
second
is,
is
the
maintenance
of
their
underground
tunnel.
we
then
have
the
nonmaritime
activities
of
all
of
the
other
instrumentalities,
all
of
the
people
like
grubart
and
the
businesses
and
buildings
in
the
chicago
loop,
which
are
far
away,
none
of
whom
were
engaged
in
any
activity
which,
under
any
argument,
could
be
maritime.
mr.
ben
barnow
no,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
is,
is
that
when
this
court
developed
the
nexus
test
it
did
it
to
find
a
substantial
connection
between
the
activity
and
traditional
maritime
activity.
unfortunately,
and
one
of
the
other
errors
that
the
seventh
circuit
committed,
was
that
it
allowed
the
admiralty
extension
act
to
bootstrap
this
court's
requirement,
and
skipped
it.
if
you
are
to
separate
the
admiralty
extension
act
from
a
nexus
requirement,
which
this
court
cannot
intend,
what
it
would
be
doing
is,
defeat
its
own
opinion.
it
would
take
all
land-based
injuries
and
put
them
in
a
special
category,
and
allow
them
to
have
admiralty
jurisdiction
without
any
connection
to
traditional
maritime
activity.
mr.
ben
barnow
if
it
chooses
to
do
that,
but
i
don't
believe
it
has.
it
set
up
no
independent--
mr.
ben
barnow
--the
definition
has
been
left
open,
as
your
honor
is
aware,
and
this
court
has
defined
and
determined
that
definition.
as
to
how
far
it
can
go
under
the
commerce
clause,
for
instance,
frankly,
i'm
not
sure.
what
i
do
know
is,
is
that
it
has
not
done
so
here.
mr.
ben
barnow
frankly,
i'm
not
sure.
if
it
goes
too
far,
i
suppose
it
might
create
constitutional
issues.
what
i
do
know
is
that
in
this
case
it
has
not,
that
in
the
passage
of
the
admiralty
extension
act,
it
meant
it
as
an
extension
of
admiralty,
in
that
it
did
not
separate
it
apart
from
what
this
court
would
determine
to
be
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction.
mr.
ben
barnow
well,
i
think
the
totality-of-the-circumstances
approach
has
been
used
by
this
court
in
other
areas.
mr.
ben
barnow
i
don't
recall
it
in
terms
of
a
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
ben
barnow
we
are,
but
in
this
particular
case,
it
merely
serves
the
test
that
this
court
has
already
developed.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
it
substitutes
for
that
test.
the
totality-of-the-circumstances
answers
one
part
of
this
court's
test,
and
therefore,
it
is
not
bigger
than
that
whole.
this
court
has
said
that
the
activity
from
which
the
incident
arises
must
have
a
substantial
relationship
to
traditional
maritime
activity,
not
any
relationship
but
a
substantial
relationship,
and
your
honor
is
right
with
regard
to
an
improper,
perhaps
imposition
of
a
totality-of-circumstances
approach
at
the
inception,
but
this
is
not
at
the
inception.
it
is
merely
designed
to
achieve
the
goals
and
guidelines
and
instructions
that
this
court
has
set
up.
all
it
does
is
answer
the
substantiality
requirement.
let's
say
you
did
not
use
the
totality-of-circumstances
test
approach.
you're
still
using
the
same
test.
you're
still
using
sisson.
you're
still
looking
for
the
incident
arising
from
an
activity
that
has
a
substantial
relationship
to
traditional
maritime
activity,
and
no
way
are
you
changing
the
jurisdictional
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
admiralty
jurisdiction.
all
you're
doing
is
saying
whether
or
not
your
test
has
been
met.
what
happens
if
you
don't
do
that?
if
you
don't
do
that,
you
wind
up
with
a
case
like
this
one.
you
wind
up
with
a
case
where
the
seventh
circuit
has
felt
it
could
not
ask
any
of
the
questions
which
go
to
the
substantiality
issue,
and
i
would
repeat
that
this
court
has
used
significant,
the
wrong
must
bear
a
significant
relationship
to
traditional
maritime
activity.
why
did
it
do
that
in
executive
jet?
because
the
court
was
tired
of
what
it
called
absurd
results.
this
case
in
admiralty,
i
propose,
would
be
an
absurd
result.
the
suggestion
that
a
company
could
come
in
on
these
facts...
and
grubart's
position
is,
there
is
no
maritime
activity.
even
if
one
were
to
say
that
great
lakes'
work
was
maritime,
we
suggest
that
the
totality-of-circumstances
forecloses
an
admiralty
finding
under
the
fact
that
the
other
situations
do
not
warrant
it.
but
this
case
is
not
of
a
type
designed
for
admiralty.
you
have
common
tort
remedies.
if
you
take
the
naked
sisson
test
and
disregard
a
substantiality,
you're
realistically
going
to
get
the
same
kind
of
absurd
result
that
this
court
has
encountered,
and
which
it
did
not
want
to
encounter.
this
court
has
spent
over
20-some
years,
starting
with
executive
jet,
trying
to
get
itself
out
of
the
quagmire
of
these
peculiar
cases
that
come
about
now
and
then.
mr.
ben
barnow
that's
basically
it
on
the
point.
i'm--
mr.
ben
barnow
--well,
first,
i'm
buoyed
by
the
court's
use
of
these
additional
inquiries,
because
sisson
doesn't
tell
you
how
to
make
those
additional
inquiries.
when
sisson
is
served
by
the
totality-of-the-circumstances
inquiry,
then
those
types
of
inquiries
can
be
made.
for
instance,
your
honor
said,
shouldn't
we
also
take
into
account,
or
shouldn't...
doesn't
the
sisson
test
also
take
into
account
the
additional
activity,
the
activity
of
the
city
of
chicago?
where?
in
the
literal
reading,
it
says,
one
activity,
but
your
honor
couldn't
do
that.
when
he
thought
about
the
situation,
your
honor
had
to
look
at
all
of
the
activities,
and
that
was
recognized
in
sisson.
sisson
said,
what
are
we
going
to
do
when
that
occurs,
and
all
the
totality-of-the-circumstances
says,
and
all...
the
only
thing
all
of
these
circuits
have
been
saying
is,
we
hear
this
court's
ruling,
but
in
order
to
answer
a
very
important
part
of
it,
we
have
to
articulate
these
other
questions,
otherwise
these
questions
really
go
sub
rosa.
the
more
structure
you
have
with
regard
to
getting
to
the
judgment,
the
more
likely
you
are
to
serve
sisson.
mr.
ben
barnow
well,
first
i'm
not
sure
that
common-sense
approach
ever
works
in
an
uncommon
problem
situation,
and
because
this
is
an
uncommon
problem,
had
the--
mr.
ben
barnow
--it
did--
mr.
ben
barnow
--correct.
it
did
that,
in
addition
to
misdefining
all
the
ingredients.
it
picked
the
wrong
incident.
the
seventh
circuit
said
the
incident
was
the
negligent
installation
of
pile-driving.
we
all
know
that
isn't
it,
because
this
court
said,
whether
or
not
the
washer
and
dryer
was
installed
negligently
in
sisson
had
nothing
to
do
with
it,
but
that
would
be
the
equality
in
that
analysis.
it
went
on
to
say
that
the--
mr.
ben
barnow
--i
am
saying
that
the
seventh
circuit
misapplied
sisson.
i
am
saying
that
sisson
may
work
in
a
situation
where
one
of
the
parties
is
not
land-engaged,
or
doesn't
have...
or
has
land
injury.
it
depends,
for
instance,
on
the
nature
of
the
maritime
aspect.
mr.
ben
barnow
i
believe
it--
mr.
ben
barnow
--i
believe
it
could.
i
think
if
you
properly
define
the
incident
as
the
breach
of
an
underground
tunnel,
which
it
clearly
is,
because
that
is
the
only
event
that
encompassed
all
the
damages--
mr.
ben
barnow
--i
do
not.
i
say
the
breach
is
the
under--
mr.
ben
barnow
--because
it
does
not
encompass
all
the
damages,
and
if
you
do
not
encompass
all
the
damages,
you
do
not
have
the
incident
for
the
event.
mr.
ben
barnow
no.
the
damage
from
the
tort.
in
order
to
define
the
incident--
mr.
ben
barnow
--i
appreciate
that,
and
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
court
ruled
the
way
it
did
in
executive
jet
was
it
refused
to
engage
in
determining
where
the
tort
occurred
with
the
airplane
crash.
that's
why
it
got
into
the
more
substantial
issues--
mr.
ben
barnow
--well,
i
have
no
problem
with
the
court
looking
to
where
the
conduct
occurred,
but
where
the
conduct
occurred
was
on
a
stationary
barge
which
had
been
spudded
in
to
the
river
bed,
which
more
likely
is
a
work
platform,
bears
more
resemblance
to
a
dock,
or
a
derrick
rig,
than
it
does
to
a
vessel.
grubart's
position
has
been,
is
that
that
wasn't
even
a
vessel,
and
that
there
is
no
test
that
is
before
this
court
that
would
find
admiralty
jurisdiction
under
these
facts.
mr.
ben
barnow
thank
you.
