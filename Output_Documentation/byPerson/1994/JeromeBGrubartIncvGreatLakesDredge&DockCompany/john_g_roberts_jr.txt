mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioners
seek
to
hold
great
lakes
liable
for
the
operations
of
its
vessel
on
the
navigable
waters
of
the
chicago
river
while
that
vessel
was
doing
what
vessels
of
its
sort
normally
do
on
navigable
water,
maritime
repair
work.
in
this
instance,
replacing
pilings
in
the
river.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
was
a
repair
barge.
it's
lengthy,
i
think
about
150
feet--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--with
a
tug.
it's
motivated
by
a
tug.
the
fact
that
it
lacks
its
own
motive
force
doesn't
make
it
any
less
a
vessel,
as
this
court
held
in
1903
in
cases
involving
barges
on
the
erie
canal.
the...
a
federal
statute
gives
great
lakes
the
express
right
to
bring
an
action
in
federal
district
court
to
limit
its
liability
when
faced
with
allegations
of
this
sort,
which
is
what
it
did,
and
the
seventh
circuit
correctly
held
that
that
claim
was
in
admiralty.
first,
the
incident
for
which
petitioners
seek
to
hold
us
liable,
and
as
to
which
we
seek
to
limit
our
liability,
occurred
on
navigable
water.
it
posed
a
threat
to
maritime
commerce.
the
greatest
threat
to
maritime
commerce
was,
in
fact,
realized
when
the
river
was
shut
to
maritime
traffic
for
more
than
a
month,
and
the
incident
arose
from
traditional
maritime
activity.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
a
decision
on
the
merits
that
would
have
to
be
made
after
trial,
as
the
seventh
circuit
ruled
in
an
issue
on
which
the
seventh
circuit
did
not--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
be
case
dismissed
on
the
merits,
like
anything
else.
if
you
assert
a
cause
of
action
under
federal
law
and
get
into
federal
court
that
way,
and
it
turns
out
the
facts
show
that
it
didn't
arise
under
federal
law
after
trial,
jurisdiction
doesn't
evaporate.
you
lose
on
the
merits.
the
same
with
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
and
they
can
be
adjudicated
once
the
court
has
jurisdiction.
it's
a
typical
pendant
jurisdiction
question,
whether
it
makes
sense
to
retain
jurisdiction
of
those
other
claims
after
the
claim
giving
rise
to
jurisdiction
has
been
dismissed.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
if
the
case
were
brought
elsewhere
it
would
be
governed
by
the
law
in
that
court.
once
it's
been
established
that
this
is,
in
fact,
not
something
within
admiralty
jurisdiction,
the
fact
that
it
was
initially
and
it
later
developed
that
it
was
not
shouldn't
change
the
character
of
the
law
that
applies.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
admiralty
extension
act
added
to
1333
gives
jurisdiction.
we
make
an
alternative
argument
that
it
gives
jurisdiction
standing
alone,
but
that's
an
argument
that
the
seventh
circuit
didn't
have
to
reach.
nor
would
this
court
if
it
concludes
that
this
is
within
general
maritime
jurisdiction
supplemented
by
the
extension
act.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
not
at
all.
i'm
saying
that...
the
admiralty
extension
act,
we
argue,
gives
jurisdiction
quite
apart
from
1333.
our
main
argument
is
1333,
supplemented
by
the
admiralty
extension
act,
confers
jurisdiction.
this
activity
took
place
on
navigable
water.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
it
specifies
that
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
includes
all
cases...
all
cases
of
injury
on
land
caused
by
a
vessel
on
navigable
water.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
within
congress'
power
to
modify
and
supplement
the
admiralty
jurisdiction,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
can
expand
it
within
reasonable
bounds,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
lower
courts
have
uniformly
found
the
act
constitutional,
and
congress--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
did,
and
congress
does
it
with
some
regularity...
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
act,
where,
for
example--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--relying
on
the
commerce
power--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
defines
a
category
of
cases
that
were...
are
arguably
within
admiralty
jurisdiction
apart
from
the
extension
act.
the
question
depends,
if
you
have
a
tort
on
navigable
water
and
the
injury
occurs
elsewhere,
it's
an
academic
question
where
that
tort
occurred,
and
what
congress
did,
it
said,
we're
going
to
resolve
that
controversy
by
saying
that
the
fact
that
injury
occurred
on
land
doesn't
defeat
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
it
noted
that
the
act
had
not
been
raised.
this
court,
of
course,
has
applied
the
admiralty
extension
act
in
cases
like
gutierrez,
without
raising
any
question
as
to
its--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
if
you
have
an
incident
on
navigable
water
posing
a
threat
to
maritime
commerce
arising
from
traditional
maritime
activity,
that
that
could
be
considered
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
apart
from
the
admiralty
extension
act,
yes,
and
here--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
we
don't,
your
honor.
we
think--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
definition
of
the
incident
and
the
activity
comes
from
the
allegations
in
the
complaint.
they
seek
to
hold
us
liable
for
what
we
did.
we
seek
the
limit
our
liability
for
what
we
did.
the
pertinent
activity
is
what
we
did.
the
fact
that
there
are
other--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we
allege
in
our
limitation
complaint,
yes,
that
the
city
is
liable
to
us
for
contribution
and
indemnity,
but
the
existence
of
other
contributing
causes
doesn't
defeat
admiralty
jurisdiction
once
it's
found
to
exist.
the
test
in
sisson
looks
to
a
potential
threat
to
maritime
commerce.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
are
the
plaintiffs
in
the
limitation
action.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
we
were
sued
by
grubart
and
the
city
and
then
brought
the
limitation
action
in
federal--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--oh,
no,
they
do
make
claims
against
the
city.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
we,
great
lakes,
may
bring
a
petition
to
limit
our
liability
in
admiralty.
well,
limit
your
liability
for
what?
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
because
the
admiralty
inquiry
isn't
a
weighing,
does
the
admiralty
interest
outweigh
any
other
interests,
it
asks,
under
sisson,
is
there
a
potential
threat
to
maritime
commerce,
is
there
a
substantial
relation--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the
pertinent
inquiry
is
into
the
activity
of
the
party
that's
seeking
admiralty
jurisdiction,
because
once
they
establish
their
right
to
that
jurisdiction,
it
can't
be
defeated
by
the
fact
that
there
are
other
contributing
factors
in
the
case.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
and
then
added
to
that,
of
course,
admiralty's
traditional
liberal
joinder
rules,
and
rule
14,
which
allows
them
to
bring
in
other
parties
for
contribution
and
indemnity,
but
the
point
is--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
question
of
what
law
to
apply,
and
this
gets
into
the
city's
argument,
is
a
different
question
from
whether
or
not
there
is
admiralty
jurisdiction.
the
argument
that
admiralty
jurisdiction
should
turn
on
preemption
analysis,
choice
of
law
analysis,
is
an
argument
that
has
been
made
before
this
court
before
and
rejected
in
the
context
of
the
romero
case.
there,
the
question
was,
do
admiralty
claims
arise
under
federal
law
under
1331,
and
justice
frankfurter,
writing
for
the
court,
said
no,
and
the
main
reason
he
gave
was
that
if
they
did,
we
would
have
to
look
at
each
admiralty
claim
and
say,
does
this
arise
under
state
law
or
under
federal
law,
what's
the
governing
law,
and
he
said,
that
type
of
analysis
is
inappropriate
at
the
jurisdictional
stage,
and
it's
just
as
inappropriate
today
as
it
was
in
1959.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
it
is
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
judge
in
that
case
whether
to
retain
the
claims
that
were
brought
in
ancillary
to
the
admiralty
claim.
in
other
words,
we
don't
think
there's
anything
necessarily
admiralty
about
grubart's
claims
against
the
city.
we
think
those
claims
could
be
brought
in
state
court.
we
think
they
can
be
brought
in
admiralty
because
they
arise
out
of
the
same
general
occurrence
that
gave
rise
to
this
claim,
and
under
rule
14,
we're
entitled
to
bring
the
city
in
to
seek
contribution
and
indemnity,
but
we're
not
asserting
that
admiralty
covers
those
claims.
the
issue
is,
can
we
bring
our
action,
given
to
us
under
federal
law,
to
limit
our
liability
in
admiralty,
and
the
question
then
becomes,
in
defining
the
activity,
liability
for
what,
and
the
liability
is
for
what
they
say
we
did,
our
negligent
conduct
on
the
river
while
we
were
engaged
in
traditional
maritime
repair
work.
if
the
activity
of
the
pleasure
yacht
in
sisson,
tied
up
at
the
dock
doing
nothing,
is
traditional
maritime
activity,
then
surely
the
activities
of
this
commercial
vessel
out
on
the
navigable
waters,
plying
its
trade
for
hire,
are
as
well.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
claimants
are
in
the
admiralty
case
under
rule
14,
and
the
city
is
brought
in.
therefore,
the
city
must
defend
its
claims,
grubart's
claims
against
the
city
under
rule
14
practice,
but
if...
taking
the
whole
thing
from
the
beginning,
if
the
grubarts
had
just
sued
the
city,
that's
not
an
admiralty
case
because
it
didn't
arise
out
of
maritime
activity,
didn't
occur
on
navigable
waters.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
then
the
claim--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the...
it
could
be,
depending
on
how
the
district
judge
in
admiralty
exercises
his
discretion
under
rule
14
to
retain
the
cases
after
the
determination
of
a
failure
of
the
liability
claim
or,
the
limitation
claim,
or
to
remand
those
to
state
court.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
a
separate
choice
of
law
inquiry
that
doesn't...
on
which
jurisdiction
doesn't
turn.
we
don't
know
yet.
the
allegations
against
us,
and
against
the
city,
for
that
matter,
run
the
gamut.
we
drove
the
pilings
in
the
wrong
location.
we
didn't
pull
up
the
old
ones
well
enough
before
driving
the
new
ones.
we
drove
the
new
ones
in
too
deeply.
we
failed
to
discover
the
tunnel.
whether
federal
law
or
state
law
governs
any
of
those
claims
is
an
issue
that
can't
be
decided
at
the
jurisdictional
stage.
it's
easy
to
imagine
the
desirability
of
a
uniform
federal
rule
about
the
location
of
pilings.
it's
easy
to
imagine
the
desirability
of
a
uniform
federal
rule
about
how
deeply
they're
driven.
vessels
are
lied
against
them
both
deliberately
and
inadvertently
all
the
time.
jurisdiction
doesn't
turn
on
that,
because
to
make
jurisdiction
turn
on
it
would
require
us
to
answer
the
question,
what
actually
caused
this
incident,
and
sisson
tells
us
jurisdiction
doesn't
turn
on
such
an
inquiry
into
the
merits.
what
does
it
turn
on?
whether
the
incident
occurred
on
navigable
waters,
as
this
did,
whether
it
poses
a
threat
to
maritime
commerce,
as
this
did,
and
whether
it
arose
out
of
traditional
maritime
activity,
as
this
plainly
did.
this
is
the
strongest
case
for
traditional
maritime
activity
to
come
before
this
court
since
it
first
articulated
the
nexus
test
in
executive
jet.
for
the
first
time,
we
have
a
commercial
vessel.
for
the
first
time,
we
have
navigable
water
actually
used
by
commercial
traffic,
and
for
the
first
time,
we
have
the
actual
conduct
of
commercial
activity.
foremost,
two
tiny
pleasure
boats
in
an
area
not
used
by
commercial
traffic,
sisson,
a
pleasure
yacht
at
a
recreational
marina,
yet
in
each
case
this
court
found
admiralty
jurisdiction
because
of
the
potential
threat
to
maritime
commerce
and
the
substantial
relation
to
maritime
commerce.
the
case
for
jurisdiction
is
that
much
stronger
here,
where
you
have
actual
maritime
commerce
involved
and
directly
affected.
now,
the
answer
that
what's
involved
is
pile-driving
is
a
red
herring.
they
say
pile-driving
is
a
common
activity,
takes
place
on
land
all
the
time,
rules
are
developed
to
deal
with
it.
well,
the
transportation
of
goods
from
point
a
to
point
b
is
also
something
that
takes
place
on
land
all
the
time
and
as
to
which
rules
have
been
developed,
but
when
it
takes
place
on
navigable
water,
you're
in
admiralty.
the
same
is
true
with
respect
to
marine
construction.
there
are
whole
fleets
of
vessels
designed
for
marine
construction
work,
just
like
there
are
vessels
designed
for
carrying
cargo,
people,
for
fishing,
salvage,
towing,
rescue,
ice-breaking,
and
when
the
marine
construction
vessels
are
out
on
the
navigable
waters
plying
their
trade,
they
are
as
involved
in
traditional
maritime
activity,
maritime
commerce,
the
core
of
this
court's
admiralty
jurisdiction,
to
as
great
an
extent
as
any
of
those
other
vessels
are.
now,
there's...
the
petitioner's
answer
to
the
admiralty
extension
act
is
to
rewrite
it.
it's
worth
recalling
what
it
says:
the
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction
shall
extend
to
and
include
all
cases...
all
cases...
of
damage
or
injury
to
person
or
property
caused
by
a
vessel
on
navigable
water,
notwithstanding
that
such
damage
or
injury
be
done
or
consummated
on
land.
now,
they
read
that
as
if
congress
meant
to
say
the
jurisdiction
shall
extend
to
some
cases
of
injury
on
land
caused
by
a
vessel
on
navigable
waters.
those
were
the
injuries
within
the
reach
of
the
vessel
and
reasonably
contemporaneous
with
the
negligent
conduct
giving
rise
to
it,
but
those
qualifications
are
found
nowhere
in
the
language
of
the
statute
or
in
its
legislative
history.
congress
knows
how
to
write
a
statute
like
that
if
it
wants
to.
that's
what
it
did
in
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers
act.
it
said
jurisdiction
extends
to
the
dock,
to
the
water,
to
the
pier...
a
laundry
list
of
things
near
the
shore.
that's
not
the
approach
it
took
in
the
admiralty
extension
act,
and--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--jurisdiction
goes
hand-in-glove
with
liability.
if
it
is
a
reasonable
allegation
of
cause
sufficient
to
give
rise
to
liability,
or
trial,
it
triggers
jurisdiction.
that's
a
system
that
makes
perfect
sense.
under
petitioner's
approach
you'd
have
jurisdiction
stopping
short
of
liability.
they
say
we
caused
this
for
purposes
of
liability,
but
they
want
to
say
we
didn't
cause
it
for
purposes
of
the
admiralty
extension
act.
the
symmetry
should
be
maintained.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
we
think
it
does.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
doesn't
follow
night
from
day.
it's
a
separate
question,
but
we
think
because
of
the
need
for
uniformity
at
the
basis
of
admiralty
jurisdiction,
the
workman
rule
does
apply.
now,
that's
something
that
can
be
debated
once
jurisdiction
is
established,
but
like
everything
else--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--we
think
it
is
a
separate
question.
we
think
the
question
has
already
been
answered
by
this
court
in
workman,
but
it
wasn't
answered
as
a
jurisdictional
question,
it
was
answered
as
a
choice-of-law
question.
this
is
the
rule
that
applies
in
admiralty.
the
city
can
argue
there
should
be
a
different
rule,
that
workman
for
whatever
reason
ought
to
be
overruled,
but
they're
two
separate
questions,
choice
of
law,
and
jurisdiction.
that's
the
teaching
of
erie
railroad
v.
tompkins
in
the
diversity
area.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
to
a
large
extent,
but
not
on
every
issue.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
number
of
areas
in
which
state
law
apply
are
many.
the
court
listed
some
of
them
in
romero,
and
it
dealt
with
another
one
just
last
term
in
american
dredging.
it's
an
admiralty
case
in
state
court
under
the
savings
to
suitors
clause,
but
the
question
was,
what
law
applies
on
forum
non
conveniens,
state
or
federal,
and
the
difficult
analysis
in
that
case
that
gave
rise
to
four
different
opinions
is
as
good
a
reason
not
to
adopt
a
choice-of-law
rule
for
jurisdiction
as
can
be
imagined.
it's
the
reason
justice
frankfurter
gave
in
romero.
choice-of-law
questions
are
delicate,
sensitive,
require
a
complex
weighing
of
interest.
look
what
they
ask
the
district
court--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--not
what
you
pick
when
they're
different,
no,
but
the
question
is,
if
there's
no
rule
to
apply,
do
you
apply
state
law,
or
do
you
devise
a
uniform
federal
rule
of
maritime
law,
and
what
the
city
says
is,
you
can
only
have
jurisdiction
if
it's
going
to
be
a
uniform
rule.
on
what
question?
it's
too
early.
look
what
they
ask
a
district
court
judge
to
do.
a
complaint
lands
on
his
desk.
the
district
court
judge
apparently
must
decide,
what
are
the
dispositive
legal
issues
going
to
be
in
this
case?
then
he
or
she
must
employ
a
choice-of-law
analysis
to
decide
whether
federal
law
is
going
to
govern
those
dispositive
issues
or
state
law
and
then,
finally,
if
it
turns
out,
as
will
often
be
the
case,
there
are
more
than
one
dispositive
issue
that
might
come
up,
apparently
the
judge
has
to
weigh
those
governed
by
federal
law
against
those
governed
by
state
law,
and
somehow
decide
which
interest
predominates.
all
that
to
decide
jurisdiction,
to
decide
whether
this
case
can
proceed
past
the
threshold
step.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
state
law--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
except
in
some
instances,
for
example,
the
state
law
can
provide
the
cause
of
action,
the
wrongful
death
cases,
before
the
passage
of
legislation
by
congress.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
this
is
a
rule
of
decision,
and
again,
we
don't
know
what
the
dispositive
issues
are
going
to
be,
because
we
don't
know
what
caused
this
incident.
is
it
because
we
drove
the
pilings
allegedly
in
the
wrong
location?
admiralty
will
have
a
lot
to
say...
federal
uniform
rules,
a
lot
to
say
where
pilings
should
be
in
navigable
water.
is
it
because
we
drove
the
pilings
too
deeply?
admiralty
will
have
a
lot
to
say
about
that,
too.
maybe
state
law
will
govern,
but
vessels
come
up
against
the
pilings
all
the
time,
and
perhaps
a
uniform
federal
rule
would
be
appropriate.
that's
not
the
sort
of
decision
that
is
made
at
the
preliminary
jurisdictional
stage.
instead,
you
look
at
more...
the
inquiry
is,
as
the
seventh
circuit
said,
more
structured.
did
this
incident
occur
on
navigable
waters?
yes.
did
it
pose
a
threat
to
maritime
commerce?
that's
not
seriously
disputed.
did
it
arise
from
traditional
maritime
activity?
this
case
involved
the
hiring
of
a
vessel
to
perform
services
on
navigable
water,
not
freakish
services,
but
what
these
vessels
do,
what
they're
designed
to
do
all
the
time,
maritime
repair
work,
repair
work
that
was
directly
related
to
navigation.
keep
in
mind,
what
i've
been
maintaining
is
this
activity
is
itself
traditional
maritime
activity.
all
that
the
test
requires
is
that
it
be
substantially
related
to
that.
these
pilings
protect
vessels
as
well
as
bridges
from
the
dangers
of
allisions.
they
serve
as
fulcrums
in
the
tight
channels
such
as
underneath
the
kinzie
street
bridge
to
turn
barge
traffic
by
being
towed
by
tugboats.
they
operate
as
channel
markers
if
they're
in
the
right
location,
as
to
which
federal
admiralty
law
will
have
something
to
say,
and
by
protecting
the
drawbridge
they
protect
maritime
commerce,
because,
of
course,
if
the
drawbridge
didn't
work,
the
commerce
couldn't
get
through.
the
relation
to
maritime
commerce
here
is
as
strong
as
in
any
case
to
come
before
this
court
since
executive
jet.
looking
at
the
injury,
taking
into
account,
as
they
say,
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
and
focusing
on
where
the
injury
occurred,
is,
in
our
view,
inconsistent
with
the
admiralty
extension
act.
it
means
that
in
two
identical
cases,
one
in
which
the
injury
is
felt
on
navigable
water,
and
the
other
in
which
the
injury
is
felt
on
land,
there
will
be
jurisdiction
in
the
former
but
not
in
the
latter,
despite
the
clear
direction
from
congress
to
the
contrary.
the
test
they
propose,
a
totality
of
the
circumstances,
seven-factor,
policy-based
balancing
test,
is
wholly
unsuited
to
the
jurisdictional
inquiry.
jurisdictional
rules
need
to
be
clear,
precise,
easy
to
apply,
and
lead
to
predictable
results.
totality-of-the-circumstances
balancing
tests
are
by
their
nature
vague,
indeterminate,
manipulable,
and
lead
to
different
results,
depending
on
who
does
the
balancing,
a
particular
concern
in
jurisdictional
cases,
because,
of
course,
any
appellate
court
must
look
at
the
question
of
jurisdiction
sua
sponte
and
reevaluate
it
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
sisson
test
is
more
structured,
it
is
more
focused,
it
limits
the
activities
that
are
pertinent,
it
doesn't
look
at
injured
parties,
what
they
were
doing,
it
focuses
on
what
took
place
on
navigable
water.
we
have
in
this
case
an
incident
on
navigable
water
that
closed
the
chicago
river
for
more
than
a
month.
it
arose
from
traditional
maritime
activity.
the
conclusion
of
the
seventh
circuit
that
that
case
was
within
admiralty
was
correct,
and
should
be
affirmed.
