justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
jurisdiction,
for
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here,
admiralty
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
we
look
to
the
damages?
take
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
for
example.
what
counts
there
is
where
the
conduct
occurred,
where
the
allegedly
negligent
conduct
occurred,
not
where
the
consequences
of
that
conduct
are
felt.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
shouldn't
we...
why
shouldn't
we
look
to
where
the
conduct
occurred,
great
lakes
conduct
occurred
on
the
river,
and
not
where
the
damage
occurred?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whatever
label
you
put
on
it,
you
really
are
urging
a
choice
of
law
analysis
to
determine
the
jurisdictional
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
court
were
to
determine...
the
district
court...
that
the
limitation
act
doesn't
apply,
that
you
don't
qualify
within
the
terms
of
the
statute.
then
what?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
would
there
be
no
more
admiralty
jurisdiction?
would
the
court
then--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--say,
case
dismissed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
thinking
of
the
claims
coming
in,
the
great
lakes
start
this
controversy,
but
couldn't
counterclaims
come
into
the
admiralty
forum?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
the
court
decided
it
didn't
make
sense,
would
the
character
of
those
claims
then
change
so
that
when
you
brought
your
suit
elsewhere
it
would
no
longer
be
considered
under
maritime
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it's
perfectly--
--your
answer
indicates
that
you
disagree
with,
what
is
it,
the
maritime
law
association,
that
sees
this
entire
matter
as
governed
by
maritime
law.
your
answer
to
my
question,
and
your
most
recent
answers,
seem
to
me
inconsistent
with
the
argument
that's
made
by
the
maritime
law
association,
that
if
your
limitation
act
claim
fails,
if
the
district
court
should
decide
great
lakes
is
not
entitled
to
limit
its
liability,
then
the
district
court
would
have
the
option,
in
effect,
of
remanding
the
case
to
the
state
court,
at
which
point
you
said
it
loses
its
water
equality
and
goes
over
to
be
just
an
ordinary,
garden
variety
tort
suit,
but
the
maritime
law
association
says
where
the
claimants,
grubart,
may
pursue
their
actions
under
the
saving
to
suitors
clause,
which
would
be
subject
to
substantive
maritime
law,
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
your
position
remains
that
if
you
lose
on
your
limitation
claim
there's
no
more
admiralty
jurisdiction,
there's
no
more
maritime
law
governing
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
picture
is
that
the
grubart
claimants
should
remain
in
state
court
with
their
lawsuits,
they
just
sit
there,
till
the
district
court
decides
the
limitation
question.
if
no
limitation,
then
those
ordinary
tort
claims
go
forward
in
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
picturing
grubart
and
all
the
others
suing
great
lakes
as
well
as
the
city.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
the
state
court,
if
your
limitation
claim
fails,
then
you
are
as
vulnerable
as
the
city
to
an
ordinary
tort
suit,
in
state
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
he
chose
to
retain
them,
they
would
be
governed
by
state
law,
not
maritime
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you...
you
at...
one
part
of
your
argument
disassociates
jurisdiction
from
choice
of
law.
if
you're
right
about
admiralty
jurisdiction,
does
it
follow
that
the
workman
rule
of
concern
to
the
city
of
chicago
applies
as
well?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
follows
like
the
night
the
day,
once
you
get
jurisdiction,
that
the
choice
of
law
will
be
the
maritime
rule?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
so
you
concede
that
there
would
be
a
choice
in
the
admiralty
forum,
a
choice
possibly
of
state
law
rather
than
maritime
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
except
maritime
jurisdiction
is
a
little
different,
isn't
it?
in
admiralty,
the
choice
of
law
to
a
large
extent,
if
you
have
jurisdiction
you
apply
maritime
law,
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
quite
different
from
diversity,
where
you
have
federal
jurisdiction
but
you
apply
state
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
those
rules,
the
romero
type
rules,
were
kind
of
gap-filling
rules
consistent
with
the
admiralty
rules,
not
which
do
you
pick
when
they
are
different.
