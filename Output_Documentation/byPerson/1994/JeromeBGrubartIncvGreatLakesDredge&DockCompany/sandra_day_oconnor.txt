well,
mr.
rosenthal,
i
thought
what
was
being
done
here
was
work
on
so-called
river
dolphins,
and
i
thought
they
were
put
in
place
to
prevent
damage
to
the
bridge
by
ships
in
the
navigable
channel.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
to
protect
both
ships
and
bridges
and
to
serve
as
aids
to
navigation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
that's
a
pretty
close
connection
there--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
work
from
a
vessel
on
navigable
waters.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
you
say
that
they
were
installed
in
a
way
that
caused
land-based
injuries.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
seems
to
me
it's
a
causation
question.
the
activity
on
the
navigable
water
caused
land-based
injuries.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
there
were
injuries
that
occurred
to
a
ship
by
virtue
of
the
piling
installation
and
also
the
land-based
injuries?
would
you
have
some
of
them
tried
in
state
court
and
some
in
federal,
even
though
the
essential
cause
of
action
is
the
same?
