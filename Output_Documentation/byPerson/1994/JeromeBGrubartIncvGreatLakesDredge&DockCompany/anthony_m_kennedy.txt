incidentally,
you
don't
question
the
congress'
authority
to
do
that
if
it
chooses?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
congress
can
define
admiralty
jurisdiction
any
way
it
wants,
even
though
it's
a
constitutional
term.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
don't
think
there's
much
problem
under
the
commerce
clause,
but
if
congress
purports
to
be
defining
admiralty
jurisdiction
in
a
way
differently
than
this
court
has
done,
does
that
cause
a
constitutional
problem
with
reference
to
the
authority
of
the
congress
to
define
what
admiralty
jurisdiction
means?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
don't
raise
that
question
in
your
brief.
i'm
not
quite
positive
of
the
answer
to
that
question.
in
determining
federal
court
jurisdiction,
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
is
there
any
other
instance
where
a
totality-of-the-circumstances
test
is
used,
for
example,
diversity,
federal
question
jurisdiction?
the
entrance
requirements
are
precise,
not,
you
take
all
these
ingredients
and
mix
them
together.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
the
workers
on
this
barge
covered
by
the
longshore
and
harbor
workers'
compensation
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
would
say
the
workers
on
this
pile-driving
barge
were
not
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
most
unlikely
that
they
would
be
found
to
be
not
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
admiralty
extension
act
purport
to
be
defining
the
constitutional
meaning
of
admiralty
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then,
it's
construing
the
phrase
admiralty
jurisdiction,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
it
expand
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
relying
on
the
commerce
power.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which,
of
course,
it
has,
but
here
it
purports
to
be
simply
defining
the
meaning
of
admiralty
jurisdiction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
sisson
didn't
cite
the
admiralty
extension
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
the
sisson
test
incorporates
the
admiralty
extension
act
and
we
can
just
apply
the
sisson
test
and
be
faithful
to
what
the
admiralty
extension
act
says?
