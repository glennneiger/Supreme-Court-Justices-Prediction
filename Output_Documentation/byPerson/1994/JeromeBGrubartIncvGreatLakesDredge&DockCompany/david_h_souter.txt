isn't
that
an
argument
against
the
extension
act?
isn't
that
going
to
be
true
in
virtually
every
case
in
which
there
is,
in
effect,
a
land-based
injury?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
barnow,
may
i
ask
you
to
get
specific
in
applying
the
third
sisson
prong?
it's
proper
under
the
third
sisson
prong
to
consider,
i
presume,
not
only
what
great
lakes
was
doing
but
what
the
city
of
chicago
was
doing,
and
your
argument
seems
to
be
that
the
city
of
chicago
was
simply
maintaining,
or
for
that
matter
failing
to
maintain
a
tunnel,
and
there's
nothing
with
any
maritime
character
to
maintaining
a
tunnel,
is
that
basically
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
ask
you,
then,
is
it
also
proper,
or
isn't
it
also
proper
under
sisson,
to
consider
the
fact
that
the
city
of
chicago
i
presume
had
some
role
in
maintaining
this
navigable
water?
didn't
the
city
of
chicago
sort
of
maintain
its
banks,
wasn't
it
the
city
of
chicago's
bridge
over
the
navigable
water
that
was
being
repaired,
and
shouldn't
these
facts
relating
the
city
to
the
maintenance
of
a
channel
of
navigable
water
also
be
considered
under
sisson,
and
if
they
are,
doesn't
the
claimed
absurdity
shrink
somewhat?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
your
claim,
then,
that
what
the
lower
court
did
in
effect
was
simply
to
isolate
the
activity
of,
the
kind
of
common-sense
way,
the
maritime
actor
and
say
the
activities
of
cotort...
of
fellow
tortfeasors
simply
are
to
be
ignored?
is
that
the
mistake
that
you
say
was
made
in
applying
sisson?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
whether
it
does
or
not,
is
that
what
you're
saying
the
court
did,
that
it
isolated...
consistently
or
inconsistently
with
sisson,
it
simply
isolated
the
acts
of
one
of
the
tortfeasors
and
ignored
the
acts
of
the
others--
justice
david
h.
souter
well...
i'm
sorry,
i
just
want
to
go
back
to
my
point.
do
you
argue
that
they
misapplied
sisson
in
this
isolation
or
elimination,
or
are
you
saying
that
they
applied
sisson
properly
and
the
sisson
test
therefore
can
never
work
in
a
case
in
which
one
of
the
tortfeasors
allegedly
at
least
does
not
bear...
is
not
engaging
in
a
traditional
maritime
activity?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
could
it
work
here,
if...
could
you,
would
you
make
an
argument
that
sisson,
properly
applied--
justice
david
h.
souter
--would
be
an
appropriate
test
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
want
to
get
down
to
that
detail,
isn't
the
incident...
you
say
the
breach,
but
the
incident
is
the...
in
effect
is
the
flood,
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
isn't
the
flood
the
equivalent
of
the
fire
in
sisson?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean,
consequential
damages
like
loss
of
business,
and
so
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
rosenthal,
does
the
city
have
any
role
in
maintaining
the
navigable
water?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
that
be
considered
under
sisson--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
aren't--
--yes,
but
that's
narrowing...
excuse
me.
excuse
me.
i
was
just
going
to
say,
that
would
be
narrowing
the
second
of
the
sisson
nexus
tests,
wouldn't
it,
because
the
second
sisson
test
looks
to
the
activity
out
of
which
the
incident
arose,
and
i
presume
that
activity
would
include
the
maintenance
of
pilings
as
well
as
the
driving
of
pilings,
and
hence
the
city
would
be
an
actor
in
that
activity.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
just
brings
you
right
back
to
the
extension
act.
sure
it
does.
that's
what
the
extension
act
is
there
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
in
effect
saying
that
by
considering
an
activity
of
the
city,
which
involves
the
maintenance
of
a
channel
of
navigable
waters,
or
water,
you're
getting
the
wrong
result
because
it
results
in
liability
for
damage
which
ultimately
eventuated
on
land,
but
that's
what
the
extension
act
is
there
for.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
and
the
nexus
includes
an
activity
of
yours
involving
navigable
water.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
roberts,
may
i
get
down
to
more
specific
cases
and
the
application
of
sisson
here?
do
you
believe
it
is
proper
in
considering
the
second
of
the
sisson
nexus
tests,
the
activities
test,
to
consider
the
activities
of
the
city
as
well
as
the
activities
of
great
lakes?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
why
do
we
divorce
the
one?
they're
joint
tortfeasors.
their
suit
is
joint
tortfeasors.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
doesn't...
doesn't...
i
confess
i
didn't
pull
out
the
complaint
before
argument.
doesn't
the
complaint
also
charge
the
city?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
see,
the
plaintiff
made
no
claim
against
the
city.
you
are
the
plaintiffs
in
this--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
grubart
made
no
claim
against
the
city.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then,
why
do
you
not
consider
the
claims
under
the
second
part
of
the
nexus
test,
why
shouldn't
the
claims
against
the
city
be
considered
as
well
as
the
claims
against
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
why
shouldn't...
yes,
why
shouldn't
however,
the
entire...
the
entire
tort
claim,
including
the
joint
character
of
the
joint
claim,
be
considered
in
making
that
determination?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the
second
sisson
nexus
test
is
a
test,
or
an
inquiry,
into
the
character
of
the
activities
out
of
which
the
incident
arose,
and
i
presume
that
if
a
claim
is
brought
against
two
joint
tortfeasors,
those
activities
include
the
activities
of
each.
