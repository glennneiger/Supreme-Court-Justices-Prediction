scalia
mr.
rosenthal,
before
you
do
that,
what
would
your
position
be
if
a
ship
on
navigable
waters
slipped
its
moorings,
drifted
into
a
dam,
caused
a
breach
in
the
dam,
and
the
dam
flooded
surrounding
territory,
causing
damage?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
be,
but
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
the
difference
between
a
dam
and
a
tunnel,
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
you're
a
vessel
doing
some
oil
exploration
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean,
and
through
some
negligent
activity
an
oil
pollution
occurs?
would
that
be
maritime?
that
would
not
be
maritime
because
oil
exploration
is
not
maritime
activity,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
oil
exploration
is
different
from
pile-driving?
justice
antonin
scalia
nobody
sails
for
the
purpose
of
sailing.
you
go
on
navigable
waters
for
the
purpose
of
doing
something
else,
to
drill
for
oil,
to
drive
piles,
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rosenthal,
you're
urging
us
to
evaluate
the
federal
interest
in
admiralty
jurisdiction.
it
reminds
me,
the
only
other
field
i
can
think
of
where
we
do
an
interest
analysis
kind
of
case
that
comes
readily
to
mind,
anyway,
is
conflict
of
laws,
where,
in
the
past
30
years
or
so,
interest
analysis
has
become,
in
academic
circles
at
least,
a
fashionable
thing.
it
has
not
produced
very
much
certainty
in
the
law.
in
fact,
that
is
a
gross
understatement.
it
has
produced
a
great
chaos
in
the
entire
field.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
is
it
your
position
that
the
maritime
extension
act
is
really
not
at
issue
here,
at
this
stage?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
would
you...
are
you
saying
that
the
admiralty
extension
act
is
just
irrelevant
to
your
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
let
me
ask
this:
isn't
it
possible,
if
you
have
a
tort
caused
by
the
negligent
actions
of
two
different
people,
that
one
of
them
would
be
suable
only
in
admiralty
and
the
other
one
would
not
be
suable
in
admiralty?
if
you
have
joint...
if
you
have
dual
causality,
it's
quite
possible
that
the
city
of
chicago
can't
be
sued
in
admiralty,
and
that
the
barge
company
must
be
sued
in
admiralty,
isn't
that
possible?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
word
caused
requires
some
limitation.
i
mean,
you
acknowledge
that
there
has
to
be
some
limitation
of
proximity
of
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
you've
been
talking
about
applying
state
law.
i
guess
there
is
this
difference
between
admiralty
and
diversity
jurisdictions,
that
in
admiralty
it's
a
federal
rule
that's
always
applied,
is
it
not,
although
the
federal
law
may
look
to
state
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
the
rule
of
decision,
whereas
in
diversity
cases
it
is
not
really
federal...
it
is
really
state
law
that
is
being
applied
as
state
law,
whereas
in
admiralty
it
is
state
law
as
applied
as
a
rule
of
federal
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
what
you're
talking
about
here.
