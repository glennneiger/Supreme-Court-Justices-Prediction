justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't...
may
i
ask
you
if
it
would
be
proper
to
restate
your
position
this
way:
you're
claiming
that
there
should
be
an
immunity
from
trial
if
two
conditions
are
met.
number
1,
you
would
be
entitled
to
summary
judgment
before
trial,
and
number
2,
you're
a
public
official,
and
therefore
may
take
an
interlocutory
appeal
to
make
good
on
your
claim.
that's
really
what
you're
saying
here,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
public
officials
should
have
a
right
to
interlocutory
appeal
on
summary
judgment
issues
because
there
is
a
value
in
not
subjecting
them
to
trial
unless
there
really
is
a
genuine
dispute,
and
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
you're
saying.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's...
you
keep
bringing
in
they
did
not
violate
clearly
established
law.
as
i
understand
it,
your
position
is
their
claim
is
that
they
did
not
violate
the
law,
clear
as
it
may
be,
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
acts.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
a
different
concept
of
immunity
from
the
normal
qualified
immunity
concept
in
which
your
first
concern
is
that
public
officials
should
not
have
to
guess
about
possible
changes
in
the
law
or
clarifications
of
the
law
that
occur
after
they
act.
here,
you're
saying
the
claim
for
immunity
is
satisfied,
in
effect,
by
the
value
in
not
subjecting
them
to
trial,
period,
unless
there's
a
genuine
dispute
of
fact,
the
kind
of
thing
that
you
raise
on
summary
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
proctor,
can't
you
argue
that
you're
not
really
reaching
a
constitutional
issue
when
your
only
question
in
effect
is,
what
was
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
act?
is
that
maybe
a
way
out
of
this
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that's
appropriate,
then
maybe
one
answer
to
the
problem
which
i
think
bothers
all
of
us
that
justice
breyer
raised
would
be
to
say,
if
the
courts
of
appeals
are
going
far
afield
in
the
records
when
qualified
immunity
issues
come
up,
the
answer
perhaps
is
that
they
should
not
be
doing
that,
and
they
in
effect
should
simply
be
deciding
the
qualified
immunity
issues
based
on
the
facts
pleaded
in
the
plaintiff's
pleadings
and
go
no
further,
and
if
that's...
if
they
confine
their
review
to
that,
then
it
would
be
very
easy
to
make
a
distinction
between
that
kind
of
a
case
and
the
case
that
is
before
us
here.
