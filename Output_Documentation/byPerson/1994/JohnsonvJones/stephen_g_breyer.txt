justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
right,
then,
then
it
doesn't...
i
mean,
you're
asking,
i
think...
you
cut
the
doctrine
loose
from
its
mooring
in
cohen.
i
think
you
do,
but
there's
an
argument
for
doing
that,
and
there's
a
pretty...
and
we're
thinking
of
the
case
where
a
policeman
says,
i
was
in
timbuktu.
there's
no
doubt
if
he
shot
the
plaintiff,
i
mean,
he's
liable,
but
he
says,
i
was
in
timbuktu
at
the
time.
that's
the
issue.
now,
you
can
stop
the
appeals
coming
up
all
the
time
on
that
through
just
what
justice
kennedy
suggested,
though
that
goes
into
the
case
we're
hearing
in
october.
but
the
other
practical
thing
that
bothered
me
is
this,
that
if
you
do
that,
you
get
these
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
that
are
very
complicated
factually,
with
people's
motives,
and
very
often
district
courts
in
those
circumstances
just
say,
send
it
to
trial,
and
the
only
practical
way
to
run
these
things,
they
send
it
to
trial.
i'm
not
going
to
go
through
5,000
affidavits
about
what
the
state
of
mind
was
of
each
of
15
prison
officers,
and
let's
try
it
out.
we'll
get
some
facts.
it
will
work.
then
you're
going
to
be
asking
before
that
trial
the
court
of
appeals
is
going
to
have
to
be
separating
all
these
things
out,
deciding
these
factual
matters
on
states
of
mind
that
even
the
district
court
couldn't
decide,
and
that's
why
it
sent
it
to
trial,
and
that
struck
me
as
a
kind
of
mess.
i'm
not
saying
that's
a
determinative
argument,
because
there
are
other
problems
the
other
side,
but
i'd
like
to
get
your
response
to
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
how
could
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you'd
have--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
what
facts
do
you
take?
the
real
practical
problem
that
was
mentioned,
and
it
doesn't
move
people
but
it
did
move
me
a
lot,
is
what
does...
what
set
of
facts
is
the
court
of
appeals
supposed
to
assume
when
it
decides
this
purely
legal
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
qualified
immunity
under
the
kind
of
standard
you're
talking
about?
look,
the
case
comes
up.
the
case
involves
a
plaintiff
who
says
the
policeman
stood
by
and
watched
while
i
was
beaten.
the
policeman
says,
i
was
in
the
next
room,
and
anyway,
it
isn't
clearly
established
that
a
person
who
stands
by
and
watches
is
liable.
the
second
is
obviously
appropriate
for
the
court
of
appeals.
what
facts
is
the
court
of
appeals
supposed
to
assume
there?
is
he
supposed
to
go...
i
mean,
how
can
you
avoid,
if
you're
in
the
court
of
appeals,
going
through
that
record
to
see
precisely
where
the
policeman
was
standing,
and
once
you
admit
that,
you're
right
down
the
road
to
saying
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
look
to
see
what
the
evidence
will
support
as
to
the
factual
matter,
and
then
there's
no
distinction
from
giving
him
the
appeal
in
the
first
place,
at
least
no
workable
one
that
i
could
find.
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
focus
on
what
i
once
rejected,
but
it
seems
is
a
very
important
practical
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
can't
decide
whether
or
not
it's
clear
unless
i
know
whether
the
policeman's
in
the
door
towards
one
room,
or
in
the
other
room.
the
answer
might
all
differ,
and
if
i'm
a
court
of
appeals
judge,
i
have
to
know
what
set
of
facts
i'm
supposed
to
answer
that
question
on
the
basis
of.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
most
favorable
as
supported
in
the
record,
right,
and
now
what
i've
done
is
i've
gone
through
the
record
to
make
my
summary
judgment
determination.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which?
that's
what
gives
rise
to
this
problem
and
is
not
answered
in
any
of
the
prior
cases.
wouldn't
it
be
the
facts
as
alleged
in
the
complaint--
--ah.
--because
these
go
up
before
any
discovery.
you
don't
know
what
the
facts
are.
it's
a
question
of
law.
yes.
and
doesn't
the
court
of
appeals
consider
the
facts
alleged
in
the
complaint?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem
with
that
is
in
many
of
these
cases
that
was
long
by
the
boards.
nobody
in
the
district
court
thinks
the
things
that
were
alleged
in
the
complaint,
often
very
general
in
nature,
have
much
to
do
with
the
real
issue.
i
mean,
there
are
cases
where
you
can
do
that,
but
others
you
can't.
well
then,
wouldn't
you
consider
the
affidavits
that
were
filed
in
connection
with
the
summary
judgment
motion
showing
the
showing
made
by
the
plaintiff?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
get
an
awful
lot
of...
i
mean,
i'm
not
saying
this
is
an
insuperable
problem.
it
may
be
possible
to
resolve
it,
but
a
lot
of
appellate...
i've
seen
quite
a
lot
of...
quite
a
few
decisions.
the
defendant
moves
for
summary
judgment,
one
of
five
defendants,
and
the
piece
of
paper
that
the
district
court
writes
has
on
it
the
word,
denied.
that's
it.
no
findings,
nothing,
because
the
judge
wants
to
send
it
to
trial.
it's
too
complicated.
let's
get
it
sorted
out
after
we
know
what
we're
talking
about.
that's
the
kind
of
case
that's
worrying
me.
my
worry
is
not
insuperable.
it
doesn't
mean
that
there's
no
way
to...
et
cetera,
but
that's
what
i
was
worried
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr.
johnson
sued
five
policemen;
he
said
they
have
wrongly
arrested
him
and
beaten
him.
three
of
the
policemen
then
asked
the
district
court
for
a
summary
judgment.
they
claimed
there
wasn’t
any
evidence
showing
really
they
had
been
around.
the
district
court
said
no,
and
they
wanted
to
appeal;
to
appeal
before
the
end
of
the
case;
an
interlocutory
appeal.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
“there
is
no
interlocutory
appeal;
you
have
to
wait
till
the
end
of
the
case.”
and
that’s
what
we
had
to
decide;
can
they
appeal
before
the
end
of
the
case
or
not?
we
think
they
cannot.
now,
they
agreed,
normally,
you
can’t
appeal
from
the
denial
of
the
summary
judgment
until
the
end
of
the
case,
but
they
point
out
they
are
special,
because
they
are
policemen
with
the
defense
of
“qualified
immunity.”
they’ll
get
off
if
the
law
was
not
clearly
against
them;
and
they
say
the
policy
behind
that
should
permit
them
to
take
an
interlocutory
appeal
here.
we
decide
however
that
the
policy
does
not
extend
to
this
kind
of
case.
this
is
a
kind
of
case
where
the
appeal
would
be
heavily
fact-laid.
where
they
have
an
appeal,
it
is
a
question
primarily
and
purely
of
law.
we
explain
in
our
opinion
how
that
distinction
fits
within
the
words
of
the
appellate
statute
and
prior
case
law
to
deny
them
an
appeal
here.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
