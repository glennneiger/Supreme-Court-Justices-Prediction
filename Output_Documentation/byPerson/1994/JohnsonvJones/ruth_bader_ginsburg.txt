justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rothfeld,
maybe
i
can
clarify
what
the
problem
seems
to
be,
at
least
for
me,
this
way.
isn't
your
claim
that
in
every
1983
case
the
public
officer
is
entitled
to
an
interlocutory
appeal
on
evidentiary
sufficiency.
isn't
that
what
your
point
is?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
theoretically.
your
position
is,
i
didn't
do
it.
the
question
is,
is
there
sufficient
evidence
to
go
to
trial,
every
1983
case
on
a
clear
question
of
evidentiary
sufficiency,
no
question
of
what
the
law
is,
just
evidentiary
sufficiency?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rothfeld,
wouldn't
it
be
better
to
stick
with
this
category?
we
have
one
category
where
the
law
is
not
clear.
that's
not
this
case.
we
have
another
category
where
plaintiff
says...
defendant
says,
what
i
did
doesn't
add
up
to
a
violation
of
federal
law,
typical
12(b)(6)
case,
and
this
case
where,
if
i
did
it,
i'm
liable,
but
i
say
i
didn't
do
it,
so
why
don't
we
just
stick
with
that
case?
you've
already
said
candidly
that
every
evidentiary
sufficiency
case
goes
up
on
appeal
on
an
interlocutory
basis,
and
what's
troubling
me
about
it
is
this.
in
the
cases
that
involve
clearly
established
law,
think
of
it
in
relative
competence.
the
courts
of
appeals
know
something
about
the
law,
but
they're
really
not
so
good
on
the
facts,
not
nearly
as
good
as
the
trial
court,
so
why
don't
we
leave
that
question
of
evidentiary
sufficiency
to
the
trial
judge
and
say,
but
when
it's
a
question
of
law,
then
you
could
take
your
interlocutory
appeal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
don't
think
that
trial
judges
on
the
whole
have
a
better
feel
for
facts
than
courts
of
appeal
judges?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rothfeld,
i
still
think
that
the
clearly
established
law
is
coming
into
this
case
when
it
really
doesn't
fit.
it
comes
out
of
harlow,
and
there,
wasn't
it
justice
white
trying
to
get
rid
of
getting
into
that
officer's
head:
i
want
it
to
be
an
objective
test
about
what's
clearly
established
law.
i
don't
want
to
find
out
whether
this
particular
officer
knew
what
the
law
was.
that
was
what
the
clearly
established
was
all
about.
it
doesn't
fit
into
this
picture
of
what
were
the
historic
facts,
what
happened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
in
time.
very
well,
mr.
rothfeld.
ms.
pillard.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about,
did
not
violate
any
law?
did
not
violate
any
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
do
you
get
this
out
of?
i
mean,
it
certainly
is
nothing
like
cohen
v.
beneficial,
which
said
it's
got
to
be
an
issue
to
the
side
of
the
merits.
this
is
the
nub
of
the
merits,
did
somebody
do
it
or
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
seems
that
would
take
cohen
totally
away
from
what
its
purpose
was,
something
that
was
not
tied
in
with
the
merits.
what
was
cohen,
the
issue
in
cohen
itself?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
security
for
costs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
litigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
has
everything
to
do
with
the
merits
of
the
litigation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
pillard,
i
thought
that
harlow
was
a
case
concerned
with
motive,
and
it
said
it
didn't
want
the
judges
to
be
exploring
what's
in
the
head
of
the
public
officer.
that's
a
motive
case.
here,
there's
no
question
of
motive.
it's
a
question
of
what
they
did,
objectively.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
not,
mr.
proctor?
isn't
it
from
the
officer's
point
of
view
much
more
sympathetic
when
the
officer
said,
i
didn't
do
anything
wrong,
than
when
the
officer
says,
i
did
something
that
was
wrong,
but
it
wasn't
so
clear
that
it
was
wrong.
if
you
get
upstairs
immediately
on
the
second
case,
why
shouldn't
you
on
the
first
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
police
officers
said,
if
we
did
that,
no
question
we
violated
clearly
established
law.
justice
breyer
asked
before
a
positive
and
more
complex
kind
of
case
that
involved
my,
maybe
questions
of
motive,
but
in
your
category
of
case,
and
i
think
there
are
a
significant
number
of
them
where
it
is
just
a
question
that
someone
says
the
police
beat
me
up,
and
the
police
say
no,
we
didn't,
there
are
no
questions
about
motive.
it's
a
question
about
what
happened.
you
started
to
say
yes,
that's
the
kind
of
case
that
cries
out
for
discovery.
in
the
other
kinds
of
cases,
discovery
is
either
some
courts
of
appeals
think
not
allowed
at
all,
others
think
it's
got
to
be
tailored,
but
i
thought
you
were
starting
out
by
saying,
my
case
is
a
discrete
category.
the
only
thing
that's
at
issue
is
what
happened,
not
what's
in
anybody's
head,
not
any
question
about
what
the
law
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
appellate
courts
do
review
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
but
they
usually
do
it
after
the
trial
is
over.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
still
the
problem,
the
haunting
problem,
try
to
explain
to
an
officer
who
says,
my
buddy
had
an
idea
that
he
may
be
doing
something
wrong
but
it
wasn't
clear.
i
wasn't
doing
anything
wrong.
he
gets
to
avoid
a
trial,
and
i
don't.
how
does
that
make
sense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
only
if
you
lose
this
case,
and
your
case
is
that
there
is
no
interlocutory
review
when
it's
only
a
question
of
what
happened.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
typically
this
case
is
not
at
all
bound
up
in
that
question.
i
thought
it
was
agreed
that
if
the
defendants
did
what
the
plaintiff
alleged
they
did,
that
would
violate
clearly
established
law.
if
they
beat
up
the
defendant,
they
violated
clearly
established
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought,
and
tell
me
if
i'm
wrong,
this
case
is
a
very
good
case
for
an
illustration,
because
there
were
two
questions,
one
that
did
involve
the
interlocutory
appeal,
was
there
probable
cause
to
arrest,
a
question
of
law.
the
court
of
appeals
said
yes,
there
was.
a
perfect
case
for
interlocutory
appeal.
second
issue:
did
the
defendants,
as
alleged,
beat
up
the
plaintiff?
the
defendants
say
no.
the
plaintiffs
say
yes.
everyone
agrees
that
if
they
did,
that
violates
clearly
established
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
case
where
you
have
an
appeal
because
there
is
a
question
of
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
don't
have
any
question
of
law...
this
case
is
one
where
there
is
no
question
of
law.
