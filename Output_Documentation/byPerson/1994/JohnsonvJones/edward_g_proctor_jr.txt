mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
xx
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
there
is
an
absolute
right
to
an
appeal,
an
interlocutory
order
denying
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
where
a
trial
judge
found
that
there
was
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
in
dispute,
simply
because
the
moving
party
is
a
public
official
who
has
also
raised
a
qualified
immunity
defense.
that's
what
i
hear
as
being
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
general
rule
is
clear
that
with
very
narrow
exceptions
denials
of
motion
for
summary
judgment
are
not
immediately
appealable.
that's
the
law
everyone
is
subject
to,
but
you
must
wait
for
final
judgment.
the
reasons
for
the
final
judgment
rule
are
to
avoid
delay
and
unnecessary
appeals,
precisely
what
would
result
if
the
decision
below
were
not
upheld.
thus,
if
only
a
claim
in
this
case
were
assault
and
battery
based
on
the
same
events
that
are
alleged
in
this
complaint,
there's
no
dispute
that
there
would
be
no
interlocutory
appeal.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
fact
the
petitioners
are
police
officers
who
claim
qualified
immunity
because
they
allege
they
did
not
do
the
acts
alleged,
whether
that
changes
the
result.
in
our
view,
the
narrow
exception
created
in
mitchell
is
just
that.
it's
a
narrow
exception,
and
it
does
not
apply
here,
because
much
of
the
rationale
for
mitchell
is
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
okay.
in
this
case,
i
believe
this
would
be
the
first
case
scenario
where
an
officer
says,
i
didn't
do
anything,
or
i
was
out
of
town,
or
i
was
there
but
i
didn't
do
anything
or
nothing
happened.
that
should
not
get
upstairs
because
mitchell
wanted
cases
to
be
dismissed
before
discovery.
that
was
the
rationale
in
mitchell.
mitchell,
this
court
did
not
want
police
officers
subjected
to
any
suit,
any
burden
whatsoever.
this
case
and
cases
like
it
necessarily
require
that
discovery
be
done
in
order
for
an
appellate
court
to,
or
district
court
to
pour
through
a
factually...
a
factual
record,
so
one
half
of
what
mitchell
and
this
court
in
mitchell
wanted
isn't
even
present
here.
secondly,
it's
not
the
type
of
question
that
had
ever
been
held
by
this
court
to
be
appropriate
for
interlocutory
appeal.
it's
a
very
different
character.
the
appellate
courts
are
to
determine
what
is
the
state
of
the
law
and
teach
us
in
other
cases,
and
police
officers
and
other
governmental
officials,
what
is
the
clearly
established
law.
they
are
to
determine
what
is
clearly
established
law,
so
the
focus
really
is
upon
what
is
legal
precedent,
not
what
the
facts
are.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
the...
reviewing
the
facts,
or
a
question
of
fact,
your
honor,
is
subordinate
to
getting,
in
my
view
to
getting
to
what
the
real
issue
is.
was
there
a
violation
of
any
established
law
in
this
case?
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
if
you're
a
court
of
appeals
judge,
it
seems
to
me,
though,
that
you
would
take
the
facts
most
favorable
to
the
nonmoving
party
as--
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
--okay.
you
definitely
have
to
look
at
the
facts
to
determine
what's
going
on.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
yes,
i--
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
chief
justice,
in
this
case
we
agreed
to
forego
to
submit
such
a
record,
but
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
can
assure
you
the
record
was
pretty
lengthy,
and
you
can
consider
affidavits,
consider
all
of
the
depositions
which
were
taken
by
the
police
officers,
or
were
taken
of
the
police
officers
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff's
deposition,
an
expert
was
disclosed
and
deposed--
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
--that
is
what
is
being
suggested
here.
really
what
i
think
is
being
suggested
here
is
it
is
appropriate
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
review
whether
or
not
the
district
judge
may
have
made
a
mistake
or
not
with
respect
to--
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
--deciding
to
send
a
case
to
a
jury.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
i
think
that
this
court's
recent
decision--
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
--i
think
this
court's
recent
decision
in
swint
is
instructive
on
that,
and
i
think
you
just...
you
have
to
go
back
and--
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
it
is
not
collateral
to
the
merits,
and
i
was
going
to
go
back
to
my
first
point
that
this
is
a
very
narrow
exception
to
allow
interlocutory
appeals
under
these...
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
no--
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
--if
the
first
case
were
allowed
to
be
determined,
or
an
appeal
would
be
allowed
to
be
entertained,
it
wouldn't
help
anybody
else
handling
any
other
type
of
claim.
it
wouldn't
state
a
new
rule
or
a
new
law.
it
would
only
be
helpful
in
that
case,
maybe,
to
say
that--
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
--to
say
that,
your
honor,
though,
i
think
would
be
to
say
that
a
court
of
appeals
is
in
a
better
decision...
a
better
position,
or
an
equal
position
with
the
district
court
to
review
factual
determinations.
that's
precisely
the
function
of
the
district
court.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
but
when
the
courts
of
appeals
review
the
facts
to
determine
whether
or
not
clearly
established
law
was
violated--
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
--courts
of
appeals,
in
an
interlocutory
appeals
setting
where
a
qualified
immunity
defense
is
asserted?
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
the
general
rule,
i
thought,
your
honor,
is
that
you
cannot
take
an
immediate
appeal
just
because
you
had
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
denied.
you
cannot,
and
this
is
a
very
narrow
exception.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
that
is
an
appropriate
question
for
appellate
review
on
an
interlocutory
appeal,
whether...
what
was
the
state
of
the
law
when
the
acts
were
allegedly
done.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
yes.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
yes,
there
can
be
orders
entered
for
limited
discovery,
and
has
been
so
in
some
of
the
cases
that
i
read.
you
can
limit
discovery
precisely
to
this
issue
without
even
getting
into
the
damages
issues
or
any
other
of
the
issues
which
may
be
in
the
case.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
but
you
would
still
be
making
factual
determinations
if
you
did
that
which--
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
--well,
this
case,
for
example,
there
were
police
reports
filed
by
all
of
the
police
individuals.
there
were
directly
contradictory
statements
between
the
plaintiff
and
the
defendants.
there
were
multiple
injuries
and
several
broken
ribs.
the
police
officers
had
placed
themselves
at
the
scene
of
the
arrest
and--
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
--exactly,
justice
ginsburg,
and
that
determination...
let's
say
that...
well,
the
district
court
in
this
case
found
that
a
question
of
fact
exists
as
to
whether
they
did
the
deeds
that
were
complained
of.
now
it
goes
to
the
appellate
court.
well,
what
is
the
appellate
court
supposed
to
decide
at
that
point?
is
it
the
petitioner's
petition
that
the
appellate
court
can
take
sides,
or
determine
which
fact
is
more
credible
than
another,
how
many
facts--
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
--yes,
after
a
much
clearer
record
has
been
made,
rather
than
vague
affidavits
and
inconsistent
statements
being
made
and
thousands
of
pages,
perhaps,
of
deposition
testimony,
and
that,
it's
our
position,
is
the
more
appropriate
time
to
review
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
at
trial,
not
the
sufficiency
of
evidence
before
trial,
or
not
what
a
jury
might...
which
fact
a
jury
might
hang
their
hat
on
or
do
we
think
that
the
jury
might
believe
this
fact
or
the
other
fact
as
opposed
to
this
defendant
as
opposed
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
okay,
i
just,
if
i
can,
put
it
in
the
context
of
this
case.
the
law
in
the
seventh
circuit
is,
if
you
do
stand
by
and
watch
other
officers
beat
an
individual
or
use
excessive
force,
you
are
just
as
culpable,
so
the
law
was
clearly
established
here.
now
i
think
should
that...
i
think
your
question
is,
should
that
officer
then,
since
that
defense
is
not
available,
the
law
is
clearly
established,
should
that
officer
be
able
to
just
assert,
i'm
innocent,
and
the
district
court
didn't
believe
me,
and
therefore
i
wanted
to
try
my
case
in
the
appellate
court
before
we
have
xx
before
any
notion--
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
just
start
with
trying
to
further
answer
questions
that
were
posed
by
justice
breyer
and
justice
kennedy
this
morning
with
respect
to
what
facts,
if
in
fact
these
types
of
appeals
are
to
be
allowed,
should
the
appellate
court
consider,
and
as
i
thought
about
it,
if
it's
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
the
pleading
stage,
my
answer
to
that
would
be
the
pleadings.
if
it's
a
motion,
denial
of
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
in
my
estimation
the
appellate
court
should
only
review
the
facts
that
the
district
court
found
persuasive,
or
that
the
district
court
lays
out
in
the
appeal.
the
district
court
will
write
an
opinion,
and
did
so
in
this
case,
laying
out
the
facts
that
in
this
case
she
relied
upon.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
and
then
lays
out
the
facts
that
the
district
court
found
persuasive
to
that
point.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
that
would
be
our
position,
with...
in
an
interlocutory
appeal,
to
decide
whether
or
not
a
question
of
fact
exists,
or
decide
whether
or
not
the
district
court
was
correct
in
finding
there
were
sufficient
facts,
or
really,
if
there
was
a
fact
that
a
jury
could
find
would
prove
the
guilt
or
innocence.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
appellate
court
should
be
doing
that,
but
in
answer
to
your
question,
your
honor,
if
in
fact
they
are
to
review...
i
think
your
question
was
along
the
lines,
what
factual
inquiry
if
these
appeals
are
allowed
should
the
appellate
court
review.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
absolutely,
and
that's
our
position,
and
that's...
and
our
position
is
certainly
the
district
court
is
in
every
bit
as
good
if
not
better
position
to
make
factual
determinations
as
to
whether
a
question
of
fact
exists
or
whether
or
not
a
case
should
go
to
a
jury
than
an
appellate
court,
and
that
is
absolutely
unequivocally
our
position.
mr.
edward
g.
proctor,
jr.
okay,
as
opposed
to
in
this
case
there
was
a
memorandum
order
which
was
written
by
the
magistrate
judge.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i
would
just
say
in
conclusion,
the
petitioners
have
a
burden
here
to
demonstrate
to
this
court
why
these
appeals
should
be
allowed.
they
haven't
done
so.
they
haven't
met
their
burden
in
that.
contrary
to
that,
this
issue
would
not
be
collateral
to
the
merits.
it
would
be
an
unjustifiable
deviation
from
this
court's
ruling
in
cohen
and
in
mitchell.
there
is
no
separate
right
not
to
be
tried
on
a
question
of
whether
an
official
did
the
acts
complained
of
or
simply
a
plea
of
i'm
not
guilty.
that's
precisely
the
question
for
trial.
it
could
lead
to
multiple
appeals
not
only
in
the
same
case,
but
where
would
it
end?
then
an
appeal
would
be
taken,
i
would
think,
in
every
one
of
these
types
of
cases
where
the
police
officer
summarily
asserts
the
district
court
made
a
mistake
with
respect
to
deciding
if
i
used
reasonable
force
instead
of
excessive
force.
i
want
an
appeal
on
that
issue.
it
wouldn't
end,
and
just
because
of
that
very
issue
an
appeal
would
be
taken
on
every
case.
it
would
cause
undue
hardship
and
burden
on
the
plaintiffs,
and
as
i
expressed
earlier,
the
benefits
to
the
public
officials,
at
least
one
half
of
them
aren't
even
present
in
this
type
of
a
scenario.
thank
you.
