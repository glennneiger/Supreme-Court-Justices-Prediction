what
was
the
second
point
again?
you
went
too
fast
for
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
immune
if
you're
innocent?
how
can
you
possibly
apply
a
doctrine
like
that,
you're
immune
if
you're
innocent.
you
don't
know
whether
you're
innocent
until
you've
been...
until
the
facts
have
been
displayed.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
an
immunity
doctrine
divorced
from
reference
to
some
principle
of
law
seems
to
me
meaningless.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be
a
very
good
rule,
but
i
just
question
your
trying
to
sneak
it
in
under
the
name
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
not
bear
any
resemblance
to
a
doctrine
of
immunity.
it's
a
doctrine
of
automatic
interlocutory
appeal
for
a
government
officer.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
we
should
extend
that
to
everybody
in
1983
cases.
maybe
everybody
in
a
1983
case
who...
every
defendant
who
makes
a
summary
judgment
motion
ought
to
be
able
to
get
an
interlocutory
appeal.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
immunity
doctrine,
but
it
does
not
follow
that
everything
that
deters
or
prevents
the
trial
of
insubstantial
claims
is
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
equating
it
with
the
immunity
doctrine
simply
because
this
new
device
would
happen
to
achieve
the
same
end,
it
would,
but
it
seems
to
me
new
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
not
the
immunity
doctrine
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you've
admitted
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
to
go
through
all
this
anyway
to
decide
what
the
immunity
claim
is.
while
you're
at
it,
why
not
finish
the
job?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
could
understand
your
position
if
these
immunity
motions
were
motions
in
limine,
before
there's
any
discovery,
before
any
evidence,
but
then
you'd
just
have
to
go
on
what's
in
the
complaint,
but
if
you
bring
up
one
of
these
motions
in
a
summary
judgment
context,
after
there's
been
discovery,
where
the
other
side
has
to
have
had
the
opportunity
to
make
discovery,
all
that
goes
up
into
court.
why
not
finish
the
job
while
you're
up
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
your
answer
is
the
statute,
that
there...
we
don't
have
open-ended
authority
to
provide
interlocutory
appeals.
cohen
is
an
exception
to
the
statute,
and
your
answer
is
this
doesn't
come
within
cohen.
it's
very
closely
connected
to
the
merits.
so
it
might
be
a
good
idea,
but
we
should
get
a
statutory
amendment.
