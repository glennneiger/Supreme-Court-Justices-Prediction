justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
immunity
is
usually
used
to
characterize
a
situation
in
which
had
the
official
been
a
private
person
he
would
have
been
liable,
but
by
reason
of
his
official
status
he
is
not.
if
that's
true,
then
i
think
what
you're
proposing
here
would
be
inadequate,
and
would
be
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
if
we
adopt
your
position
that
one
way
to
curtail
the
number
of
appeals
would
be
to
say
in
another
case,
and
the
dispute
has
yet
to
be
resolved,
that
there
can
be
only
one
interlocutory
appeal.
would
you
agree
with
that
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
agree
with
that
position,
because
everything
you
have
said
about
protecting
the
officer
seems
to
me
to
indicate
that
you
would
allow
multiple
appeals
if
new
affidavits,
or
new
evidence
was
adduced
after
a
summary
judgment
disposition
the
first
go-around.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
telling
us--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
you're
telling
us
that
there
can
be
a
motion,
an
interlocutory
appeal
in
every
summary
judgment
case,
and
that
they
can
be
multiple.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
still
concerned
with
what
justice
breyer's
concern
was.
suppose
there
are
two
arguments
at
the
summary
judgment
stage.
one
is
that
there
are
no
facts
to
support
your
claim.
the
other
is,
even
if
the
facts
do
support
the
claim,
there
has
been
no
clearly
established
constitutional
right.
are
you
saying
that
only
the
first
goes
up
to
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
only
the
second
goes
to
the
court
of
appeals,
because
if
you
say
that,
then
we're
reversing
the
usual
order
in
which
we
don't
reach
constitutional
questions
if
it's
not
necessary
to
do
so.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
you're
asking
the
court
of
appeals...
suppose
both
issues
are
in
the
case,
and
you're
asking
the
court
of
appeals
to
reach
an
important,
difficult
constitutional
question
which
might
not
be
necessary,
because
there
is
a
strong
argument
that
the
facts
don't
establish
the
position
anyway,
and
that
this
is
reversing
the
usual
presumption,
which
is
that
we
don't
reach
constitutional
issues
unless
we
have
to,
and
the
defendant
in
this
case
says
you
don't
have
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
this
is
always
a
question
of
law.
courts
of
appeals
can
do
this.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they're
reviewing
the
pleadings
on
summary
judgment.
they
do
it
all
the
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
not
in
an
interlocutory
setting,
of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
would
seem
to
me
odd
to
start
constructing
discovery
rules
based
on
preserving
an
interlocutory
right
of
appeal
under
the
cohen
doctrine,
but
perhaps
what
you
could
say
is
something
like
pendent
jurisdiction.
you
could
say,
under
your
position,
that
the
only
issue
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
reviewing
is
whether
or
not
there's
a
clearly
established
constitutional
right,
or
similar
issues
of
law,
but
that
if
it
is
necessary
in
a
case
in
order
to
reach
the
issue
to
look
at
a
summary...
to
look
at
the
facts
and
the
sufficiency
allegation,
then
the
court
may
do
that.
that
might
be
something
of
an
exception,
but
i'm
afraid
it
might
swallow
the
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
these
are
factual
determinations
of
the
kind
the
appellate
court
can
make
in
a
summary
judgment
context,
i.e.,
to
determine
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
the
allegations
to
go
forward.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
confined
to
the
facts
the
district
court
thought
was
relevant
to
the
legal
inquiry?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
thought
you
were
saying
that's
what
the
appellate
court
should
not
be
doing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
is
not
always
inextricably
bound,
though,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm...
the
reason
i
ask
is,
i'm
wondering
if
we
could
make
a
distinction
on
that
basis.
