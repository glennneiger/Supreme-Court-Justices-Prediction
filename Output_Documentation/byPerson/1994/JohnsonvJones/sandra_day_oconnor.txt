justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
rothfeld,
this...
my
question
ties
in
with
that
of
justice
ginsburg.
xx
on
a
question
like
this
the
district
court
will
decide
whether
there's
enough
evidence
to
go
to
trial.
in
this
case,
the
police
officer
found
the
plaintiff
banging
his
head
against
the
wall,
and
by
the
time
the
arrest
had
been
completed
and
he'd
been
hauled
off
to
jail,
he
was
found
to
have
suffered
from
broken
ribs
and
other
physical
injuries
that
are
not
consistent
with
banging
the
head
against
the
wall.
now,
the
trial
judge
thought
that
was
xx
circumstantial
evidence
to
let
it
go
to
xx
seems
to
me
it
would
be
a
very
rare
case
that
xx
appeals
is
going
to
second
guess
that
kind
of
xx
say,
oh,
no,
you've
got
it
wrong,
it
xx
at
all.
there
may
be
circuits
that
are
xx
kind
of
thing,
but
in
how
many
instances
is
the
xx
appeals
really
reversing
the
trial
judge's
xx
of
the
facts?
i
think
you're
asking
for
something
xx
not
very
practical.
