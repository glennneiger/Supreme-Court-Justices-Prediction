mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
public
official
who
sued
under
section
1983
and
whose
response
is
that
he
did
nothing
wrong
has
asserted
a
defense
of
qualified
immunity
that
may
be
raised
on
interlocutory
appeal.
in
answering
that
question,
i
think
it's
useful
to
divide
it
into
three
component
parts
and
to
consider
them
separately.
first,
whether
an
official
who
says
that
he
did
not
violate
clearly
established
law
because
he
didn't
violate
the
law
at
all
has
asserted
a
defense
of
qualified
immunity,
second,
whether
the
validity
of
that
defense
is
somehow
called
into
question
by
the
existence
of
a
predicate
factual
dispute
about
what
the
defendant
did,
and
third,
whether
an
immunity
defense
of
this
kind
satisfies
the
cohen
test
for
interlocutory
appeals,
and
i'll
consider
those
three
points
in
turn.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
the
second
issue,
which
i
think
is
an
integral
component
of
the
first,
is
whether
the
existence
of
a
predicate
factual
dispute
about
what
it
is
that
the
defendant
did
somehow
calls
into
question
the
validity
of
what
otherwise
would
be
a
valid
qualified
immunity
defense.
on
the
first
point,
whether
or
not
there
is
an
immunity
defense
at
all,
the
court
of
appeals
was
of
the
view
that
immunity
comes
into
play
only
to
protect
public
officials
who
acted
in
the
face
of
legal
uncertainty,
and
therefore,
under
the
court's
approach,
a
public
official
who
says
that
he
didn't
violate
clearly
established
law
because
the
law
was
in
a
state
of
flux
or
uncertainty
when
he
acted,
does
state
an
immunity
claim
and
may
take
an
interlocutory
appeal
if
that
defense
is
denied.
but
under
this
approach,
the
public
official
who
says
that
he
did
not
violate
clearly
established
law
because
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
violated
the
law
at
all
does
not
raise
an
immunity
claim
and
cannot
take
an
interlocutory
appeal.
now,
we
think
that
that
approach
is
based
on
a
fundamental
misunderstanding
of
the
immunity
doctrine.
immunity
is
not
designed
solely
to
protect
public
officials
who
face
legal
uncertainty
when
they
act.
instead,
the
court
has
repeatedly
defined
qualified
immunity
to
protect
all
official
defendants
who
did
not
violate
clearly
established
law.
that
is
a
group
that
necessarily
includes
defendants
who
did
not
violate
the
law
at
all
either
because
they
didn't
commit
the
acts
alleged
or
because
the
acts
alleged
were
clearly
constitutional.
that
point
follows
directly,
i
think,
from
the
purposes
of
the
immunity
doctrine
as
repeatedly
stated
by
the
court.
the
court
has
said
time
and
again
in
cases
like
harlow--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
we're
not
saying
that
we
shouldn't
be
liable
here.
we're
saying
that
we
have
a
conceptually
distinct
immunity
from
suit
because
we
didn't
violate
clearly
established
law,
and
we
shouldn't
lose
that
immunity--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--essentially
that's
right,
justice
souter.
we're
saying
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--we're
saying
they
have
a
right
to
interlocutory
appeal
when
they've
moved
for
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
they
did
not
violate
clearly
established
law
because
they
didn't--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that's
right,
but
there
are
two
aspects--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
aspects
that
are
being
connected
here,
your
honor.
i
think
it's
useful
to
look
at
them
individually.
the
first
is
the
question
of,
can
we
claim
immunity
because
we
didn't
violate
the
law
at
all,
and
i
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
siegert
v.
gilley
makes
clear
that
we
can,
that
the
first
step
involving
an
immunity
claim
is
to
decide
whether
the
plaintiff
has
alleged--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is...
that
would...
theoretically
it
would
be
possible
in
every
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
on
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
as
to
whether
the
defendant
committed
a
constitutional
violation,
that
is
our
position,
and
let
me--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
let
me,
if
i
can--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--if
i
can
take
a
step
back
and
try
to
describe
the
conceptual
framework
which
i
think
makes
clear
what
it
is
that
we're
asking
for,
in
resolving
an
immunity
claim
there
are
going
always
to
have
to
be
two
steps.
the
allegation
is
that
what
the
defendant
did
violates
clearly
established
law.
in
addressing
that
claim,
the
court
has
to
xx
make
some
assumption
about
what
the
defendant
did
and
then
apply
the
clearly
established
law
to
that
state
of
facts,
so
looking
first
at
whether
the
law
was
clearly
established
or
not,
clearly
we
cannot
lose
the
immunity
claim,
because
the
law
was
clear
that
what
we
did
was
constitutional,
so
the
fact
that
the
claim
here
is
that
the
defendant
ultimately
didn't
violate
the
law
at
all
shouldn't
detract
from
the
immunity
claim.
the
second
step
of
the
inquiry
is
then,
all
right,
let's
look
at
what
the
defendant
did
and
decide
whether
that
violated
clearly
established
law.
now,
there
typically
are
disputes
about
what
defendants
have
done,
in
cases
in
which
immunity
is
claimed,
and
in
that
situation
the
court
has
to
make
some
assumption
about
what
the
defendant
did.
it
can
either
accept
the
allegation
of
the
complaint,
or
it
can
look
to
the
summary
judgment
record.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
certainly,
justice
kennedy,
preventing
liability
for
public
officials
who
acted
in
a
state
of
legal
uncertainty
is
a
purpose
of
the
immunity
doctrine,
but
immunity
has
considerably
broader
purposes,
and
siegert
i
think
demonstrates
clearly
that
the
principle
that
only
officials
who
did
violate
the
constitution
but
did
so
at
a
time
when
it
all
was
in
flux,
i
think
that
is
not
the
only
purpose,
but
the
conclusion
in
siegert
was
that
the
official
defendant
was
entitled
to
immunity,
because
the
plaintiff
had
not
made
out
a
violation
of
the
constitution
at
all.
the
court
said--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
there
are
several
answers
to
that,
justice
o'connor...
justice
ginsburg.
i've
done
this
before,
and
i
apologize.
i
think
that
first
of
all
we
have
some
significant
empirical
evidence
of
how
good
the
courts
are
in
handling
appeals
of
this
sort.
there
are
six
circuits
that
have
adopted
the
rule
that
we
are
endorsing
here.
they
have
applied
it
for
some
years,
and
have
not
had
any
difficulty
in
sorting
through
these
factual
records.
this
is
the
kind
of
inquiry
that
courts
make
routinely
when
they
review
decisions
granting
summary
judgment
motions,
so
i
think
that
we
are
not--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
i
don't,
but
the
question
here
is
a
legal
question
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact,
and
the
court
has
recognized
repeatedly
that
is
a
question
of
law.
that
is
a
question
that
the
courts
of
appeals
resolve
routinely,
as
i
say,
on
appeals
with--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think,
to
the
contrary
let
me
make
two
points
in
response
to
that.
first,
in
a
substantial
number
of
these
cases
in
which
these
appeals
are
taken,
a
majority
of
the
reported
decisions,
the
decisions
of
the
district
courts
denying
summary
judgment
motions,
are
overturned
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
cite
a
number
of
these
decisions
in
footnote
3
of
our
brief,
of
our
opening
brief.
and
that
i
think
is
because
there
are
substantial
institutional
constraints
that
prevent
public
officials
in
this
situation
from
taking
insubstantial
appeals,
because
they
are
faced
with
additional
section
1983
attorney's
fees
liability
if
they
ultimately
lose
on
the
merits,
because
the
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeals
both
have
procedures
for
weeding
out
insubstantial
claims.
in
fact,
in
every
case--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
we
should
not
depart
from
the
basic
principle
that
the
court
has
stated
repeatedly
in
its
immunity
decisions
in
harlow
and
in
anderson
and
in
mitchell,
over
and
over,
that
the
point
of
the
immunity
doctrine,
the
fundamental
purpose,
is
to
prevent
the
trial
of
insubstantial
claims
because
of
all
the
familiar
reasons
that
insubstantial
suits
against
innocent
public
officials,
because
of
the
burdens
that
those
impose
on
the
political
system
and
the
court.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i'm
using,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i'm
using
the
court's
definition
of
immunity,
which
is
that
it
protects
all
public
officials
who
did
not
violate
clearly
established
law,
which
necessarily,
as
i
say,
includes
officials
who
didn't
violate
the
law
at
all.
it
would
be
a
perverse
result--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
again,
as
in
siegert,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
court
concluded
that
the
first
step
was
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
law.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
true.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
true,
and
if
it
is...
if
we
accept
the
proposition
that
there
is
an
immunity
defense
stated
when
there
has
been
no
violation
of
law
at
all
because
then
there
necessarily
hasn't
been
a
violation
of
clearly
established
law,
you're
led
to
the
question
of,
does
the
existence
of
the
factual
dispute
somehow
preclude
the
appeal
of
that
issue,
and
again,
the
court
has
to
make
some
assumption
about
what
the
defendant
did
so
that
it
can
apply
to
clearly
established
law.
in
making
that
assumption,
it
either
sticks
with
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
or
it
looks
at
the
entire
summary
judgment
record.
now,
the
court's
decision
in
anderson
v.
creighton
makes
clear
that
in
the
district
court,
the
district
court
is
not
stuck
with
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
when
there's
a
factual
dispute
about
what
the
defendant
did
that
is
relevant
to
the
immunity
question.
the
court
will
look
to
the
entire
record,
will
apply
rule
56,
as
it
ordinarily
does,
and
will
decide
whether
there's
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact.
if
there
is
no
such
issue,
the
court
will
accept
the
defendant's
version
of
what
he
did
for
purposes
of
resolving
the
immunity
argument.
in
this
case,
that
would
lead
to
judgment
for
the
defendants.
when
appeal
is
taken,
the
question
then
is,
is
the
court
of
appeals
stuck
with
what
the
district
court
said
about
whether
there
is
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact.
we
think
it
would
be
a
very
peculiar
rule
to
say
that
the
district
court
may
consider
the
entire
summary
judgment
record,
and
the
court
of
appeals
cannot.
ordinarily,
the
courts
of
appeals
consider
on
appeal
of
a
question
which
is
legitimately
before
them,
and
the
question
here
can
always
be
raised
whether
what
the
defendant
did
violated
clearly
established
law.
the
court
ordinarily
considers
all
issues--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
certainly
harlow
doesn't
resolve
the
question
here,
but
harlow
sets
the
framework
of
what
is
it
that
determines
whether
a
defendant
should
be
accorded
liability,
and
as
we
say,
the
formulation
of
harlow
has
been
repeated
in
all
of
these
court's
cases.
the
innocent
defendant,
as
the
defendant
in
harlow
was
characterized,
the
defendant
who
has
done
nothing
wrong,
should
not
be
subjected
to
the
burdens
of
litigation
for
all
of
the
reasons
that
the
court
has
identified,
and
i
think
i
had
probably
better
sit
down
while
i
have
the
chance,
if
there
are
no
immediate
further
questions.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
start
with
the
hypothetical
that
was
presented
at
the
opening
argument
by
justice
breyer.
what
happens
in
a
case
in
which
there
is
an
unsettled
question
of
law
and
a
factual
dispute?
there's
no
doubt
an
appeal
lies
in
that
case.
when
it
gets
to
the
court
of
appeals,
what
state
of
facts
should
the
court
assume?
as
matters
now
stand,
every
circuit,
as
the
seventh
circuit
has
pointed
out,
including
the
seventh
circuit,
does
not
consider
itself
bound
either
by
the
statement
in
the
complaint
or
by
the
district
court's
conclusion.
instead,
the
court
of
appeals
itself
makes
a
determination
of
whether
there's
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact
by
looking
to
the
entire
summary
judgment
record,
and
that
approach
makes
perfect
sense.
the
question
of
whether
there's
a
genuine
issue
of
fact
about
what
the
defendant
did
is
inextricably
bound
up
with
the
question
of
whether
the
defendant's
actions
violated
clearly
established
law.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
typically
it
will
be,
certainly
in
the
case--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--but
the
question
is,
justice
ginsburg,
is
the
conduct
of
the
defendant
violative
of
clearly
established
law?
the
court
has
to
make
some
assumption
about
what
it
is
the
defendant
did,
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--let's
look
at
the
first
point,
the
probable
cause
issue.
had
the
issue...
the
question
of
fact
there
been
disputed,
had
there
been
some
dispute
as
to
what
the
arresting
officers
knew
at
the
time
of
the
arrest,
the
appellate
court
would
have
to
have
some
factual
basis
for
resolving
the
question
of
whether
there
was
probable
cause
or
whether
a
reasonable
officer
would
have
believed
probable
cause
to
exist,
and
the
question
then
is,
is
the
court
stuck
with
what
the
district
court
said
about
whether
there's
a
genuine
issue
of
material
fact,
or
may
the
appellate
court
make
its
own
determination
on
that
question.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
now--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
the
question
is...
there
is
a
question
of
law.
it's
an
easy
question
of
law.
is
what
we
say
the
defendants
did
violative
of
the
constitution?
the
answer
is
clearly
no,
but
again,
there
is
always
going
to
be
a
question
of
law,
an
issue
of
law
to
be
applied
to
the
facts,
and
the
question
is,
what
facts
should
the
court
assume
in
deciding
that
question
of
law?
in
the
probable
cause
situation
that
you
stated,
again,
you
have
to
look
to
what
the
officers
knew,
and
in
looking
to
what
the
officers
knew,
you
have
to
say,
what
did
they
know?
either
they
knew
what
the
district
court
believed
they
knew,
or
the
court
of
appeals
can
look
to
the
record
in
deciding
that.
and
if
the
court
can
do
that
in
a
question...
in
a
case
in
which
there
is
an
unsettled
question
of
law,
it
would
be
perverse
to
say
that
they
can't
do
it
where
the
law
is
clear
that
what
the
defendant
did
was
constitutional.
that
would
give
more
favorable
treatment
to
defendants
who
might
have
or
who
actually
did
violate
the
constitution
than
to
those
who
clearly
did
not.
thank
you,
your
honor.
