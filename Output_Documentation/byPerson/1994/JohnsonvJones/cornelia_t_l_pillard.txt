ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
with
the
petitioner
that
the
right
that
petitioner
seeks
here
is
properly
characterized
as
part
of
the
immunity,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
nomenclature
is
really
the
key.
the
key
is
that
a
right
not
to
be
tried
on
insubstantial
claims
is
as
much
at
stake
here
as
it
was
in
mitchell
v.
forsyth.
the
only
way
to
protect
that
right
is
to
allow
for
immediate
appeal.
the
reason
this
court
in
mitchell
recognized
a
right
not
to
be
tried
was
to
protect
public
officials'
exercises
of
discretion
as
long
as
they
don't
violate
clear
law.
fear
of
baseless
suits
can
create
skewed
incentives
and
drive
public
officials
to
inaction
when
the
public
interest
requires
that
they
act.
that
fear
is
created
as
much
by
suits
like
this
one
that
lack
an
evidentiary
basis
under
celotex
and
anderson
as
by
suits
based
on
unclear
law.
the
respondents
here
are,
if
anything,
even
more
entitled
to
claim
a
right
not
to
be
tried
than
are
persons
who
do
violate
the
law.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
think
it
would.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
think
it
would,
your
honor,
and
that's
because
the
same
interests
would
be
served
in
those
cases,
which
is
when--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--i
would
say
that
all
you
would
have
to
decide
to
rule
for
petitioners
in
this
case
is
whether
a
claim
under
rule
12(b)(6)
or
under
rule
56
that
included
an
assertion
that
the
official
did
not
violate
clear
law,
and
so
it
might
not
apply.
it
might
apply,
but
it
wouldn't--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--that
would
be
included,
and
the
distinction
that
i
was
trying
to
make
is
that
there
might
be
dispositive
defenses,
but
that
would
be
statute
of
limitations
or
something--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--well,
i
think
the
key
question
in
responding
to
whether
cohen
applies,
again,
is
whether
there
is
a
reason
to
recognize
here
a
right
not
to
be
tried,
and
in
mitchell
the
court
found
that
the
cchen
factors,
including
the
separability
factor,
was
easily
met
there
because
there
was
a
right
not
to
be
tried
there.
now,
the
inquiry
here
is
separate
from
the
merits.
it's
the
threshold
rule
56
inquiry,
whether
there's
sufficient
evidence
to
go
forward,
and
you
know,
once
the--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--the
issue
in
cohen
was
whether
a
denial
of
a
motion
for
security
for
counsel
fees
was--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--right,
could
be--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--that's
right,
and
there
is
moreover--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--you're
exactly
right
that
there's
more
overlap
here,
and
i
think
under
mitchell,
where
the
right
not
to
be
tried
is
at
stake,
more
close
association
with
the
merits
is
tolerated.
under
mitchell,
all
that
was
required
was
that
the
issue
be
conceptually
distinct,
and
here
i
think
that
it
is.
i
wanted
to
add
a
response
to
some
of
the
questions
from
the
bench
to
mr.
rothfeld
from
justices
o'connor
and
ginsburg,
who
i
think
were
suggesting
that
it
perhaps
might
be
more
practical
to
defer
to
what
the
district
court
does
in
sifting
the
evidence,
and
limit
this
kind
of
appeal
under
mitchell
to
the
circumstance
where
there's
really
a
doctrinal
question
for
the
court
of
appeals
to
address,
and
i
have
two
responses
to
that,
and
one
is
really
addressing
the
policies
of
recognizing
a
right
not
to
be
tried,
and
the
second
is
perhaps
more
technical.
that
idea
of
making
a
distinction
between
legal
issues
that
have
to
do
with
sifting
the
evidence
and
legal
issues
that
are
more
doctrinal
runs
contrary
to
the
fundamental
impetus
of
harlow.
the
court
in
harlow
reformulated
the
qualified
immunity
inquiry
precisely
to
ensure
that
qualified
immunity
would
be
more
susceptible
of
pretrial
disposition
by
the
courts
and
less
likely
to
be
tied
up
with
a
jury
disposition
on
the
facts,
and
to
say
that
mitchell,
in
turn,
takes
a
unique
and
narrow
view
of
what
a
legal
determination
is,
and
thereby
deprives
the
courts
of
appeal--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--that's
right,
and
my
point
was
really
on
a
slightly
more
general
level,
that
the
notion
of
taking
what
doesn't
require
a
jury
trial.
perhaps
a
motive
inquiry
would
require
a
jury
trial.
here,
under
rule
56,
it's
established
that
that
doesn't
infringe
any
seventh
amendment
jury
right,
or
it
doesn't
entrench
on
the
fact-finder's
rule,
and
yet
the
suggestion,
i
think,
is
that
even
there
we're
going
to
leave
that
inquiry
with
the
district
courts,
and
i
think
that
cuts
against
the
impetus
of
harlow
to
say,
let's
take
as
much
of
this
as
we
can,
make
it
a
legal
determination,
and
make
it
susceptible
of
disposition
pretrial,
and
then
again,
if
the
district
court
errs,
susceptible
to
correction
on
an
immediate
appeal.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
well,
i'm
aware
that
that's
an
issue
on
which
the
court
has
granted
certiorari,
and
that
is
one
of
the
mechanisms
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
explored.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
think
a
rule
restricting
to
one
in
every
case
might
be
too
rigid,
but
i
think
there
is
an
interest
in
finality
that
might...
adherent
in
the
cohen
finality
doctrine
might
be
some
kind
of
limitation--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--on
the
number
of
appeals.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
there
may
be
cases
in
which
multiple
appeals
would
be
appropriate.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
well,
i
think
under
anderson
v.
liberty
lobby
that
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
in
a
proper
position
to
affirm
the
district
court's
decision
to
go
ahead
and
let
that--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--mess
go
to
trial.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
for
the
same
reason
the
district
court
applied
rule
56--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--that
way.
the
court
of
appeals
could
do
that
as
well
if
there
was
some
suggestion
there.
but
i
think
also
your
point
is
premised
on
a
distinction
that
just
wouldn't
work,
and
i
think
if
you
take
a
hypothetical
from
the
mitchell
case
itself,
that
shows
why
that
distinction
would
frustrate
even
the
core
qualified
immunity
claim.
for
example,
if
the
district
court
in
mitchell
had
not
denied
qualified
immunity
because
it
found
the
law
was
clear,
but
instead
had
denied
it
by
erroneously
holding
that
there
was
a
dispute
in
the
evidence
in
that
case
about
whether
there
was
a
national
security
justification
for
the
wire
tap,
the
court
of
appeals
in
that
kind
of
case
has
to
look
at
the
record
to
conclude
that
the
district
court
was
wrong.
without
correcting
that
error,
the
court
of
appeals
would
be
unable
to
verify
that
the
claim
falls
within
the
gray
area
and
that
qualified
immunity
is
warranted.
now,
that
kind
of
review,
the
sifting
of
the
evidence,
has
to
be
available
in
that
case,
otherwise
mitchell
would
have
been
deprived
of
immunity,
his
conduct
would
have
been
the
same,
the
state
of
the
law
would
have
been
the
same,
and
the
interest
in
prompt
disposal
in
that
case
would
have
been
the
same
as
they
were
in
the
mitchell
case,
so
a
refusal
to
consider
a
district
court's
error
when
it
inheres
in
the
evaluation
of
whether
the
facts
meet
the
rule
56
standard
is
something
that
has
to
be
amenable
to
interlocutory
review.
