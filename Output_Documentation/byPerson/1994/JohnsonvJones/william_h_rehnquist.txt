chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-455,
tyson
johnson
v.
houston
jones.
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
immunity...
to
my
mind,
it's
a
defense.
you
know,
when
you
state
a
claim
for
a
violation,
the
answer
is,
that
may
all
be
true,
but
i
have
this
immunity
defense
available,
whereas
you're
really
attacking
the
allegations
of
the
complaint.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
siegert,
there
was
no
dispute
about
the
facts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
didn't
take
that
to
reevaluate
the
factual
conclusions
or
the
summary
judgment
conclusions
of
the
lower
courts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
ms.
pillard.
mr.
proctor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
court
of
appeals
would
simply
review
what
the
district
court
had
done
on
summary
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
would
pretty
much
eliminate
the
value
to
the
defendant
of
the
interlocutory
appeal
in
mitchell
v.
forsyth.
if
all
you
can
challenge
is
the
plaintiff's
pleadings,
the
complaint,
which
can
be
very
general,
vague,
and
so
forth,
you
get
a
much
clearer
idea
of
what
the
case
is
about
if
you
do
have
discovery
and
take
some
depositions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
there
xx
1:00
p.m.--
mr.
proctor,
you
may
resume.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course,
the
district
court
doesn't
find
facts
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
may...
it
decides
how
it
rules
on
the
basis
of
either
uncontroverted
facts
or
those
that
are
controverted
in
favor
of
the
nonmoving
party.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
proctor.
mr.
rothfeld,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
94-455,
johnson
against
jones
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
