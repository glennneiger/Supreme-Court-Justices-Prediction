justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
your
position
would
also
lead
to
allowing
appeals
in
these
cases
from
denials
of
motion
to
dismiss
for
legal
insufficiency?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
basically
any
interlocutory...
any
order
we
used
to
think
of
as
interlocutory
would
be
appealable
by
the
defendant
in
a
1983
case
if
he
could
say
there
really
isn't
much
basis
for
this
suit.
