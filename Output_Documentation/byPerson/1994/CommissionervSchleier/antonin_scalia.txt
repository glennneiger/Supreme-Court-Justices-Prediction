justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
as
you
know,
i
didn't...
in
burke
did
not
think
that
your
regulation
making
the
line,
the
tort
like
line
was
within
the
statute,
but
we
held
that
it
was.
you've
given
two
reasons
for
saying
that
this
is
not
tort
like.
one
is
that
it's
only
on
the
intentional
violation
that
these
damages
are
awarded,
but
some
torts
require
wilfulness
as
well.
the
tort
of
assault,
for
example.
you're
entitled
to
damages
from
that,
but
it's
a
purely
wilful
tort.
if
you
do
not
show
wilfulness,
you
do
not
recover.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
say
the
same
about
assault.
i
don't
know
whether
you're
punishing
the
injury
or
punishing
the
bad
intent.
they
both
have
to
be
there,
and
it's
the
same
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
about
a
state
tort
statute
that
says,
henceforward
for
certain
types
of
torts...
let's
say
torts
by
ski
resorts.
some
western
states
have
limited
their
tort
laws
in
order
to
enable
ski
resorts
not
to
be
sued
out
of
existence.
suppose
a
state
says
that
henceforward
negligence
recoveries
against
ski
resorts
cannot
include
any
pain
and
suffering
component.
you
can
get
compensated
for
your
economic
loss
from...
now,
does
that
become
a
nontort?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
but
that's
not
what
i
would
consider...
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
we...
what
you
meant
by
tort
like.
you
meant
the...
i
mean
the
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
you
personally,
mr.
jones--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
irs--
justice
antonin
scalia
--invented
this
tort
like
thing,
but
i
would
not
consider
the
touchstone
of
tort
like
to
be
whether
you
are
entitled
to
pain
and
suffering
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jones,
what
do
you
do
about...
remember
my
ski
resort
example.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
you
said
isn't
a
tort
because
there's
no...
suppose
someone's
injured
under
such
a
statute
and
is
not
killed
but
is
injured
to
such
a
degree
that
the
person
becomes
ill
and
cannot
go
to
work.
that
comes
under
this
provision,
though,
doesn't
it,
because
it's
personal
injury
or
sickness.
sickness
is
okay.
if
the
only
damages
you
get
are
for
your
illness,
it's
okay,
but
if
it's
a
personal
injury,
somehow
it
has
to
be
tort
like.
that's
a
very
strange
result,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
sounds
correct
that
it's
strange,
or
it
sounds--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
cannot
imagine
why
any
interpretation
which
applies
a
different
test
when
the
person
just
gets
sick
and
is
out
of
work
for
that
reason
and
another
test
where
the
person
loses
the
job
by
reason
of
the
same
tort,
i
just...
that
seems
to
me
weird.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
the
problem
is
not
the
internal
revenue
code
or
the
irs.
maybe
you
should
reformulate
your
principle
that
persons
similarly
injured
should
be
compensated
similarly.
that
seems
a
reasonable
proposition
to
me,
and
maybe
that's
the
source
of
the
difficulty.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
has
simply
provided
an
irrational
differential
in
compensation,
but
if
that
produces
an
irrational
differential
in
tax
law,
the
problem
is
with
the
origin
of
the
relief.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
it?
it
interferes
with
my
right
to
contract,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
any
less
personal
than
a
right
to
be
employed
regardless
of
my
age,
or
to
be
employed
regardless
of
my
sex,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
think
so,
but
we've
abandoned
that,
and
in
fact
it
doesn't
just
say
personal
injury,
it
says
personal
injury
or
sickness,
but
we've
abandoned
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
said
it
means
any...
you
know.
i
mean,
i
would
have
thought
it
meant
what
the
chief
says,
suggests.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
human
identity.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
too
profound
for
me.
i'm
not
sure
i
can
cope
with
that.
can
you
get
that
kind
of
injury
when
you
fire
everybody
over
70
years
old,
that's
that
kind
of
injury?
what
on
earth
does
that
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
say
over
60.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
never
mind
the
measure,
whether
it's
measured
precisely
by
the
personal
injury.
does...
do
you
have
to
demonstrate
that
the
personal
injury
has
occurred?
do
you
have
to
show
that
the
individual
knew
about
the
age
discrimination?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
individual
being
discriminated
against
in
an
age
discrimination
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
only
personal
injury.
that's
the
only
personal...
the
feeling
that
the
accountant
had
of
being
less
of
a
human
being.
justice
antonin
scalia
personal
identity,
whatever
you
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
person
didn't
even
know
about
it...
but
he's
still
entitled
to
damages,
isn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
with
no
personal
injury.
so
it's
not
even
but
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see,
so
it
doesn't
have
to
be
on
account
of.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
kind
of
statutes
are
those,
now,
wrongful
death
statutes
and
any
others
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
for
a
fact
that
the
government
has
allowed
deduct...
or
nonreporting
of
income
under
those
particular
statutes
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe...
maybe
that's
explainable
because
that's
real
personal
injuries--
--yes.
--and
real
personal
injuries
you
can
get
it
for
anything,
but
those
personal
injuries
that
qualify
as
such
because
they
are
tort
like,
then
you
make
the
investigation.
i
think
that's
what
justice
stevens
has
suggested.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
didn't
say
that
in
burke.
like
was
the
only
category,
i
guess.
