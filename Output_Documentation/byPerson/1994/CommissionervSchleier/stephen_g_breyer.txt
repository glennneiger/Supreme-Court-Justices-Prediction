stephen
g.

--it's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the...
you
put
your
finger
on
just
the
part
that's
bothering
me,
that
i
don't
understand
this
tort
like
notion.
what's
wrong
with
saying
sure
the
ski
resort
is
a
tort?
now,
you'd
have
slander
of
an
accountant.
that's
a
tort,
even
though
there
are
no
damages
other
than
economic
damages.
but
you
also
say,
why
do
we
have
to
bother...
say
everything's
a
tort.
antitrust
is
a
tort,
if
it's
not
contract.
still,
the
damages
have
to
be
on
account
of
personal
injury.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
argued
both
things,
so
my
question
really
is,
isn't
this
effort
to
say
is
it
really
a
tort
or
is
it
really
something
else,
just
a
waste
of
time?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
not
say,
forget
irs
reg
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding,
forget
whether
characteristically
it's
called
under
ancient
history
in
blackstone
or
something
tort,
or
has
some
other
name.
call
it
a
tort.
just
look
to
see
whether
the
damages
are
on
account
of
personal
injury.
i'm
not
saying
i
agree
with
what
i've
just
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
want
to
get
your
reaction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
you
want
to
say
something
about
the
third...
what
seems
like
a
third
part
of
the
statute,
that
as
you've
talked
about
the
tort
like
nature
of
the
suit,
and
i
might
go
along
with
that
for
the
sake
of
argument,
the
irs
reg
defines
the
words,
damages
received,
all
right,
and
so
the
damages
have
to
be
damages
from
a
tort
like
suit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
also
it
says
there
somewhere
in
this
background
personal
injury,
and
i'll
go
along
with
that.
this
is
a
terrible
insult,
physical
and
psychological
harm,
et
cetera.
i'll
go
along
with
that.
but
it
also
says,
and
the
irs
reg
doesn't
address
this,
that
the
damages
in
the
tort
like
suit
have
to
be
on
account
of
the
personal
injury,
and
so
if,
in
fact,
you
have
a
tort
suit,
but
the
state,
say,
limits
the
damages
in
that
tort
suit
so
you
can't
recover
for
the
personal
aspect
of
the
harm,
but
only
the
lost
wages
when
the
accountant
was
insulted
and
slandered,
libeled,
how
can
that
be
on
account
of
the
personal
injury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
say
yes.
let's
assume
it's
tort
like,
absolutely.
slander
of
an
accountant
is
a
tort,
and
let's
also
assume
that
in
the
background
the
poor
accountant
is
suffering
like
mad,
as
people
do
when
they're
slandered
or
fired,
that
if
you
limit
the
damages
just
to
the
lost
wages,
for
example,
how
is
it
damages
on
account
of
the
personal
injury?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
it
still
suggests
that
these
personal
injuries
had
something
to
do
with--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
account
of,
and
now
that's
the
part
i'd
like
you
to
address.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
simply
but
for,
and
then
do
you
have
authority
for
that,
that
it
means
only
but
for?
