justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
do
have
a
tort
like
remedy
in
the
sense
that
you
have
in
effect
punitive
damages,
and
that's
tort,
that's
not
contract.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
get
us...
they
get
us
outside
the
simple
ambit
of
burke,
though.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
was
not
the
majority
opinion.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
it
was
very
good,
but--
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
the
judge
also
charge
that
they
are
supposed
to
make
him
whole,
or
her
whole
with
respect
to
back
wages?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
that
is
so,
is
this
really
the
kind
of
case
which
the
court
had
in
mind
when
it
was
pointing
to
the
sort
of
discretionary
valuation
that
juries
make,
and
if
the
answer
is
no,
then
perhaps
even
though
the
jury
and
some
panoply
of
remedy
features
are
satisfied
here,
this
still
wouldn't
fall
within
what
burke
was
getting
at.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
the
court
thought
that...
if
the
court
thought
that
jury
discretion
in
a
different
sense,
discretion
in
weighing
evidence
to
determine
in
the
first
place
whether
there
had
been
a
discrimination
and,
in
the
second
place,
whether
it
was
wilful
was
important,
then
there
would
have
been
no
need,
i
suppose,
to
emphasize
the
range
of
damages
too,
and
when
you
get
to
the
range
of
damages,
isn't
that
a
signal
that
what
the
court
was
really
talking
about
was
a
discretion
that
goes
beyond
the
kind
of
discretion
that
we
talk
about
in
fact
finding,
and
points--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
the
kind
of
discretion
that
we
speak
of
in
terms
of
valuation,
which
does
not
seem
to
be
present
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
in
the
presumed
damages
case,
damages
are
presumed
but
the
jury
has
to
set
the
amount,
whereas
here,
the
jury
does
not
have
that
kind
of
discretion.
the
amount
we're
talking
about
in
cases
like
this,
if
the
jury
follows
its
instructions,
is
essentially
a
matter
of
the
arithmetic.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
