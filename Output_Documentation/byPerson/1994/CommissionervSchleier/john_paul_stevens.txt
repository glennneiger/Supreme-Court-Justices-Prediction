justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
not
true
that
even
if
it
were
not
a
tort
like
remedy,
if
it's
a
remedy
for
personal
injuries,
you
still
get
the
exclusion.
say
it's
workman's
compensation,
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
an
insurance
recovery,
say,
on
account
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
tort,
is
what
i'm
trying
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
but
congress
treats
it...
the
statutes
are
not
fungible.
the
remedies
under
this
statute
are
different
from
the
remedies
under
other
antidiscrimination
statutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
congress'
decision,
not
ours.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
can
you
get...
you
can
get
punitive
damages
under
title
vii
as
amended,
can't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
unlimited,
and
you
can't
get
those
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that...
you
can
get
300,000
if
your
actual
damages
are
only
20.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whereas
you
can't
do
that
under
this
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
statutes
are
not
all
exactly
alike.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
all
i'm
suggesting.
congress
has
got
a
bunch
of
different
schemes,
and
i
think
we
have
to
look
at
each
one
separately.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there's
another
difference
that
keeps
running
through
my
mind.
the
nature
of
the
discrimination
is
somewhat
different.
racial
discrimination,
under
constitutional
principles,
we
look
at
very
harshly,
gender
discrimination
somewhere
in
between,
and
age
discrimination,
if
there's
any
rational
basis
for
it,
it's
okay.
it's
not...
it
doesn't
have
the
same
insult
associated
with
it
as
these
other
forms
of
discrimination
do,
so
it's
less
of
a
tort
type
kind
of
discrimination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
have
you
injured
them
in
anything
other
than
an
economic
way?
they
lose
their
job.
do
they
get
a
lower--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
isn't
that
commanded...
forget
the
regulation
provision,
wouldn't
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
have
compelled
that
result,
if
it's
on
account
of
personal
injuries?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
question?
what
is
the
service
position
for
recovery
in
a
tort
of
somebody
driving
somebody
out
of
business,
predatory
contract,
damages
are
totally
economic?
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
it
evidence
from
the
title
of
the
case,
this
is
a
tax
case.
the
respondent
is
a
former
employee
of
untied
airlines
who
along
with
pursuant
to
the
policy
of
the
company
was
discharged
when
he
reach
the
age
of
60.
he
and
other
employees
bought
sued
against
united
airlines
alleging
that
the
termination
has
violated
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
of
1967.
eventually
the
case
was
settled
and
he
received
a
$145000.00
half
of
which
was
attributed
to
back
pay
and
half
to
so
called
liquidated
damages.
the
question
in
the
case
is
whether
he
has
to
pay
income
tax
on
the
recovery
that
turns
on
the
further
question
whether
the
amount
he
received
was
?damages
received
on
account
of
personal
injuries
or
sickness
within
the
meaning
of
the
internal
revenue.?
the
courts
of
appeals
have
divided
on
the
question
in
this
case
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
income
was
not
taxable.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict
and
for
reason
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
and
conclude
he
must
pay
income
tax
on
both
portions
of
the
settlement.
justice
scalia
has
concurred
in
the
judgment.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined
entirely
in
which
justice
souter
has
joined
part
ii.
