mr.
jones,
is
it
not
the
case
that
age
discrimination
claims
are
sometimes
joined
with
title
vii
claims?
for
example,
sex
discrimination
claims?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
my
question
is,
if
you
can
bring
both
claims,
as
i
understand
you
can,
and
this
will
cover
settlements
as
well
as
litigated
cases,
then
can't
the
parties
manipulate
themselves
in
and
out
of
tax
consequences
by
either
putting
the
damages
under
title
vii
in
their
settlement
papers
or
under
the
age
discrimination
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
are
equal
pay
act
cases
treated
in
this
regime
that
the
commissioner
is
now
administering?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
a
case
where
there
would
be
a
total
overlap.
an
equal
pay
violation
would
always
be
a
title
vii
violation,
would
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
my
concern
is
that
you
take
this
panoply
of
antidiscrimination
laws,
title
vii,
the
equal
pay
act,
the
age
discrimination
act,
the
disabilities
act,
and
they
all
seem
to
be
remedying
the
same
type
of
wrong,
yet
in
some
cases
the
award
will
be
excludable
and
in
other
cases
they
will
not,
and
what
sense
does
that
make?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
even
if
we
take
title
vii
itself,
and
now
in
the
post...
was
that
1991?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
two
parts
of
title
vii,
i
believe
your
position
is
that
if
it's
intent
discrimination
then
it's
excludable,
but
if
it's
impact,
then
it's
not
excludable,
and
those
two
are
often
pled
in
the
alternative.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
it's
an
intent
case,
but
if
i
don't
make
it
on
that,
then
it's
an
impact
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
but
you're
largely,
then,
leaving
it,
at
least
as
far
as
settlement
is
concerned,
up
to
the
parties
when
you
have,
it
could
be
one
or
could
be
the
other,
and
good
faith
you
could
plead
one
or
the
other,
but
for
settlement
purposes
you'll
pick
the
one
with
the
advantageous
tax
consequences.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
these
aren't
punitive
damages.
they're
liquidated
damages,
which
as
the
chief
just
suggested
measure
a
given
in
lieu...
because
damages
are
hard
to
measure,
not
punishment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
take
it
that
the
commissioner
then,
despite
justice
scalia's
opinion,
had
no
occasion
to
rethink
whether
it
should
maintain
this
tort
or
tort
type
rights
regulation?
i
mean,
if
you...
just
the
words
of
the
statute,
personal
injuries
or
sickness,
have
been
expanded
in
that
regulation,
but
that
is
the
commission's
position,
that
tort
or
tort
like
rights
is
the
regime,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if,
in
fact,
the
remedy
in
a
title
7
case,
let's
say,
is
just
back
pay
and
nothing
further
is
awarded,
it's
still
excludable
under
the
current
position
of
the
service,
is
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
did
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even
though,
in
fact,
the
jury
awards
only
back
pay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
talking
in
the
traditional
tort--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
personal
injury
type
tort--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
here
you've
got
the
exact
same
thing
that
you
have
in
burke,
except
now
the
statute
says,
in
addition
to
back
pay...
we're
not
measuring
the
losses
if
we
were
talking
about
personal
injury
automobile
accident,
it's
straight
back
pay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
disabilities
act
comes
under,
is
under
the
title
vii
pattern
rather
than
the
age
discrimination
pattern,
does
it
not,
the
americans
with
disabilities
act?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
has
a
broader
panoply
of
remedies
than
the
age
discrimination
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
the
extent
that
the
core
remedy
under
the
age
discrimination
act
is
making
up
for
lost
wages,
why
should
that
escape
income
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
don't
understand
your
first
answer.
you're
charging...
in
an
age
discrimination
case,
you're
charging
the
employer
with
discriminating
against
you
because
of
your
age,
so
how
do
you...
how
can
you
not
know
about
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
by
the
time
the
complaint
is
filed
she
surely
does.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when...
if
you're
right
that
this...
these
damages
under
the
age
discrimination
act
should
be
treated
just
like
damages
for
disparate
treatment
under
title
vii,
and
then
we
come
to
the
jury,
and
the
question
that
the
judge
asks
counsel
is,
he
says,
well,
this
is
excludable
from
income,
i
understand.
therefore,
i
will
tell
the
jury
that
the
amount
that
they're
going
to
award,
to
the
extent
it
covers
back
pay,
will
not
be
taxed.
would
you
agree,
if
you're
right,
that
that
should
be
the
consequence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
isn't
there
an
irony,
then,
the
one
who
ends
up
benefiting
from
this
is
the
tortfeasor,
because
the
jury
will
say,
oh,
well,
we
can
give
less
because
what
we
give
is
not
going
to
be
subject
to
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here
the
range
is
simply
the
liquidated
damages
double
the
back
pay
award.
it
is
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--a
range
is
one
other
remedy.
