mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
section
104(a)(2)
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
damages
received
on
account
of
personal
injury
or
sickness
are
excluded
from
tax.
this
case
concerns
whether
back
wages
and
liquidated
damages
awarded
under
the
age
discrimination
and
employment
act
are
excluded
from
tax
under
this
statute.
a
closely
analogous
question
was
presented
to
the
court
just
three
terms
ago
in
united
states
v.
burke.
that
case
involved
application
of
section
104(a)(2)
to
a
back
wage
award
on
a
sex
discrimination
claim.
as
the
court
concluded
in
burke,
although
employment
discrimination
obviously
may
affect
a
personal
interest,
the
statutory
back
wages
remedy
involved
in
that
case
compensated
only
the
employee's
economic
loss.
it
provided
no
compensation
for
the
personal
components
of
the
employee's
injury,
such
as
pain
and
suffering
and
emotional
distress.
what
the
court
concluded
in
burke
was
that
a
statutory
remedy
that
focuses
in
this
manner
on
the
economic
rather
than
the
personal
components
of
the
employee's
injury
does
not
yield
damages
on
account
of
personal
injury
within
the
meaning
of
section
104(a)(2).
now,
the
analysis
applied
by
this
court
in
burke
is
also
applicable
to
the
present
case.
under
the
adea,
there
are
two
types
of
money
recoveries,
back
wages
of
the
type
that
this
court
concluded
were
not
excluded
from
income
in
burke,
and
liquidated
damages
in
an
amount
equal
to
the
back
wages
award
but
only
in
cases
involving
wilful
violations
of
the
act.
pain
and
suffering,
emotional
distress,
and
other
similar
personal
components
of
the
employee's
injury
are
not
compensable
or
even
admissible
in
an
ada
suit.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
tort
like
remedy
is
to
be
a
tort
like
remedy
for
a
personal
injury.
in
deciding
what
was
a
tort
like
remedy
in
burke,
the
court
focused
on
the
absence
of
any
remedy
for
the
personal
components,
pain
and
suffering.
the
court
also
mentioned
jury
trials
and
punitive
damages,
but
those
are
very
weak
indicators
of
whether
the
underlying
claim
is
a
tort
like
claim
for
a
personal
injury.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
i
don't
think
so.
actually,
justice
souter,
your
concurring
opinion
in
burke
stated
what
we
believe
is
the
correct
interpretation.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
you
state
in
your
concurring
opinion--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
in
your
concurring
opinion
you
said
that
the
majority
holds
that
what
determines
a
tort
like
claim
is
whether...
is
solely
whether
the
claim
remedies
the
personal
components
of
the
employee's
loss,
and
we
think
that's
the
correct
interpretation
of
burke.
as
i
was
saying,
punitive
damages
can
be
awarded
even
in
cases
involving
economic
torts,
but
the
indicator
of
whether
it's
a
tort
for
a
personal
injury
is
whether
it
provides
compensation
for
the
personal
elements
of
the
injury.
this
is
a
common
application
of
a
very
basic
principle
of
the
tax
law,
which
is
that
because
exclusions
from
income
are
to
be
narrowly
interpreted,
the...
in
determining
whether
the
transaction
fits
within
the
exclusion,
you
have
to
determine
whether
it
not
only
meets
the
form,
but
meets
the
substance
of
what
the
statute's
designed
to
protect,
and
it's
in
that
respect
that
the
tort
like
remedy
has
to
remedy
the
personal
component
of
the
injury
because
if
it
only
remedies
the
economic
component,
then
it
may
in
form
look
like
a
personal
injury,
but
in
substance
it's
just
an
economic
award
and
should
be
taxed
just
like
all
other
economic
awards.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
may
be
that
there
are
independently
violations
of
those
two
separate
statutes,
but
there's
no--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--here
again,
you
run
into
the
resistance
of
the
commissioner
to
mere
form
as
opposed
to
substance.
there
is
an
ample
body
of
case
law
addressing
exactly
what
you're
describing.
the
secretary,
or
the
commissioner,
his
delegate,
looks
to
the
substance
of
what
the
claims
were
in
making
the
allocation.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
allocation
made
by
the
parties
is
sort
of,
if
you
will,
ordinarily
respected,
but
if
there's
evidence
of
what
you
described
as
manipulation,
certainly
the
commissioner
would
reallocate
the
award
and
make
a
deficiency
based
upon
what
he...
what
she
understands
to
be
the
substance
of
the
party's
claims.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
have
to
admit
that's
a
very
difficult
question
for
me
because
i'm
not
100
percent
confident
on
the
remedial
scheme
of
the
equal
pay
act.
i
think...
well,
let
me
assume
that
it's
like
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
i
know
that
like
the
ada
it
refers
to
some
of
the
remedies
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
but
if
it
were
like
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
where
you
had
liquidated
damages
that
were
automatically
awarded
as
additional
compensation,
rather
than
as,
under
this
statute
as
a...
only
for
wilful
violations,
even
so,
that
compensation
would
not
be
compensation
for
the
personal
elements
of
the
employee's
loss
in
the
commissioner's
view.
it's
an
economic
compensation.
it
was...
as
this
court
described
in
the
brooklyn
savings
case,
it
was
compensation
for
delay
in
payment
of
the
economic
damages.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
sorry,
i
really
can't
answer
that
question.
i'm
just...
i'm
not
sufficiently
familiar
with
the
scheme,
the
remedies,
or
even
of
the
substance
of
the
equal
pay
act
to
help
on
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it
makes
sense
in
respecting
the
distinctions
that
congress
drew
between
those
statutory
schemes.
we
have
to...
the
commissioner
has
to
be
concerned
with
the
application
of
this
revenue
statute
to
all
types
of
claims,
and
the
distinction
that
we've
drawn,
and
that
the
court
drew
in
burke,
between
statutes
to
just
compensate
for
economic
loss
and
statutes
that
compensate
in
addition
for
personal
loss
is
important
in
applying
the
statute
to
all
types
of
remedies.
now,
in
the
area
of
employment
discrimination,
congress
has
drawn
certain
distinctions
between
different
types
of
remedies.
we're
simply
respecting
the
distinctions
that
congress
drew,
just
as
this
court
did
in
burke.
in
burke
the
court
said
that
a
title
vii
recovery,
which
at
that
time
compensated
only
for
economic
losses
and
not
for
personal
losses,
was
not
excluded,
so
i
believe
that
the
question
that
you're
asking
was
really
anticipated
or
was
indeed
the
subject
of
burke.
that's
what
the
court
concluded
in
burke.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
1991.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
certainly.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
burke
to
regard
the
disparate
impact
case
which
provides
only
for
back
wages
to
be
excluded
from
income.
what
happened
in
1991
was
that
congress
provided
additional
remedies
for
the
intentional
discrimination
case,
the
compensatory
damages,
including
compensation
for
these
personal
components
of
loss.
in
doing
so,
the
court...
i'm
sorry,
congress
identified
that
claim
as
in
substance
as
well
as
in
form
a
remedy
for
personal
injuries.
for
disparate
impact
cases,
it
provides
only
an
economic
remedy,
just
as
it
does
under
the
adea,
so
in
substance
what
congress
did
was
leave
that
as
an
economic
recovery.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
as
i
have
already
explained,
the
service's
only
tool
in
that
situation
is
to
enforce
what
it
believes
to
be
the
substance
of
the
party's
recoveries.
sometimes
you
can
tell.
sometimes
it's
relatively
visible
that
there's
been
a
contrivance,
but
if
there
hasn't
been
a
contrivance,
i
suppose
what
that
would
suggest
is
that
the
remedy
in
fact
was
for
the
personal
component
of
the
loss,
if
both
were
available.
now,
if
i
could
get
to
this
case,
the
courts
below
agreed
with
the
framework
of
analysis
that
i've
described.
they
differed
only
in
a
conclusion
that
the
liquidated
damages
component
of
the
age
discrimination
act
recovery
was
in
a...
was
an
indirect,
implied
form
of
compensation
for
the
personal
component
of
the
employee's
loss,
but
that
conclusion
is
not
correct.
in
twa
v.
thurston,
the
court
explained
that
ada
liquidated
damages
are
a
double
damages
device
designed
to
punish
and
to
deter
wilful
violations
of
the
act.
the
court
explained
that
the
liquidated
damages
for
wilful
violations
of
the
ada
are
a
direct
substitute
for
the
criminal
sanctions
for
wilful
violations
of
the
fair
labor
standard
act,
from
which
the
ada
remedies
were
largely
drawn.
so
the
ada
liquidated
damages
remedy
is
not
an
automatic
award
given
as
additional
compensation
in
each
case,
as
it
was
under
the
pre
1946
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
that
were
involved
in
the
court's
decisions
in
brooklyn
savings
and
overnight
motor.
and
in
thurston,
in
distinguishing
those
older
flsa
cases,
the
court
specifically
pointed
out
that
liquidated
damages
for
wilful
violations
are
a
sanctioned...
are
a
substitute
for
criminal
sanctions
and
are
punitive
in
nature.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
in
downey
added
something
very
useful
on
this
topic.
what
they
pointed
out
was,
even
if
you
could
regard
liquidated
damages
for
wilful
violations
as
somehow
compensatory
rather
than
punitive
in
nature,
they
clearly
are
compensation
for
the
personal
components
of
the
employee's
loss.
the
availability
and
amount
of
liquidated
damages
under
the
adea
has
no
bearing
whatever
on
the
existence
or
amount
of
the
personal
component
of
the
employee's
loss.
ada
liquidated
damages
are
not
available
on
account
of
the
underlying
injury.
they're
available
on
account
of
the
employer's
improper
state
of
mind,
his
wilful
misconduct,
and
when
they're
awarded
the
amount
of
the
recovery
is
limited
solely
by
the
economic
loss
of
the
employee.
the
personal
components
of
that
loss
are
given
no
consideration.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
liquidated
damages
i
think
came
out
of
contracts,
but
i
think
that
what
we
have
to...
what...
lorillard
v.
pons
is
helpful
in
understanding
what's
going
on
here.
in
lorillard
v.
pons,
the
court
pointed
out
that
when
flsa
remedies
were
drawn
into
the
adea,
to
the
extent
that
they
were
drawn
in
without
change
they
should
be
given
a
similar
interpretation,
but
to
the
extent
they
were
drawn
in
with
the
change,
they
should
be
given
a
different
interpretation,
and
in
lorillard
v.
pons,
the
court
specifically
pointed
out
that
liquidated
damages
under
the
flsa
had
meant
something,
but
now
it's
something
different
under
the
adea.
i
think
that
what
happened
was
that
the
term
flsa,
but
the
concept
was
changed
into
a
substitute
for
the
criminal
remedy.
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
correct.
i
think
as
an
ordinary
contract
remedy
that
would
be
the
concept
that
it
addresses,
but
as
i
pointed
out,
when
it
came
along
into
the
adea,
it
really
changed
its
nature,
and
as
the
court
said
in
thurston,
it
became
punitive
in
nature
and
a
substitute
for
criminal
sanctions.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
point
that
we're...
the
distinction
i'm
trying
to
make
when
i
talk
about
wilful
is
whether
the
resulting
award
is
compensation
for
the
underlying
injury
or
compensation...
or
rather,
not
compensation,
but
punishment
for
the
employer's
misconduct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
the
difference
is
that
when
the
statute
refers
to
injury,
i
think
it's
in
the
legal...
context
of
the
legal
injury.
in
an
assault,
the
legal
injury
isn't
just
the
harm,
it's
the
occurrence
of
the
conditions
that
give
rise
to
the
action.
punitive
damages
are
not
based
upon
the
legal
injury
to
the
defendant,
they're
based
on
punishment
of
the
improper
state
of
mind
of
the
defendant.
i
think--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--sometimes,
but
i
think
what
i
was
trying
to
point
out
is
it's
reasonably
clear
that
in
dragging
this
term
along
into
the
adea
it
wasn't
describing
the
contractual
historical
notion
of
liquidated
damages.
that's
exactly
what
the
court
held
in
thurston,
indeed,
that
this
was
a
punitive
sanction
designed
to
deter
and
punish.
it
changed
its
nature
as
it
moved
along,
but
as
the
seventh
circuit
explained,
whether
you
regard
it
as
compensation
or
as
punishment,
it
doesn't
compensate
for
the
personal
components
of
the
loss.
it's
like
burke.
it
doesn't
have
the
form
or
the
substance
of
compensation
for
the
personal
components
of
the
employee--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
becomes...
it...
that's
a
question
that
i
think
the
commissioner
would
answer
it
becomes
a
nontort
like
remedy
for
a
personal
injury.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right,
it
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
again,
you
have
to
focus
on
just
not
tort
like,
but
the
context
of
this
is
tort
like
remedy
for
a
personal
injury.
if
we
unleash
the
word
tort
like
from
the
context
of
personal
injury,
then
we
include
it,
i
suppose,
perhaps
in
antitrust
remedies,
perhaps
securities
laws,
anything
that's
not
based
on
contract.
what
the
regulation
does
is
it
directs
the
distinction
to
be
made
between
whether
the
statute
is
just
providing
an
economic
remedy
or
is
providing
a
remedy
for
the
personal
components
of
the
loss.
there
are
two
other
points
that
i'd
like
to
briefly
make.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
two
rulings
issued
by
the
service
both
before
and
after
burke,
the
agency
has
concluded
that
a
statutory
remedy
that
provides
simply
back
wages
and
liquidated
damages
in
an
equal
amount
and
that
does
not,
like
an
ordinary
tort,
provide
compensation
for
personal
components
of
the
loss,
is
not
excluded
from
income
under
the
regulation.
it
is
not
a
tort
like
remedy
because
it
lacks
that
element
of
the
personal
component
of
loss.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
workman's
compensation
comes
in
directly
under
a
different
part
of
104(a),
and
in
fact
you
don't
have
to--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--insurance
recovery...
a
mere
accident
comes
in
under
104(a)(3).
mr.
kent
l.
jones
under
104(a)(2)
it
has
to
be
damages
on
account
of
personal
injury,
which
the
service
interpreted
to
require
there
to
be
a
tort
or
tort
like
compensation
or
the
personal
injury,
so
it's
easy
to
overrun
the
various
components
of
the
statute.
here
we're
just
talking
about
the
one,
and
in
deciding
whether
this
kind
of
recovery
has
both
the
form
and
the
substance
of
a
recovery
on
account
of
personal
injuries,
the
service
has
focused
on
whether
it
provides
just
an
economic
compensation
like
any
other
economic
recovery,
or
does
something
more.
now,
the
service's
interpretation
has
been...
is
a
reasonable
one.
it's
consistent
with
burke.
indeed,
it
adopts
burke.
as
the
court
said
in
national
mufflers
dealers,
it's
important
to
give
deference
to
the
agency's
interpretation
to
ensure
that
in
these
areas--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--of
limitless
factual
variation
like
cases
are
treated
alike.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
not
so
much
a
waste
of
time
as
i
will
concede
that
it
is...
it
tends
to
create
confusion.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
understand.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
my
reaction
to
that
is
that
the
service
since
1960
has
applied
this
regulation
to
pursue
the
goal
that
you've
described.
now,
it
could
be
that
it
wasn't
necessary
for
that
purpose,
but
it
was
adopted
for
that
purpose,
and
it's
been
interpreted
in
that
fashion.
it
seems
to
add
a...
it
adds
one
element
of
direction
to
the
inquiry,
and
that
is
whether
the
recovery
under
a
tort
like
model
includes
compensation
for
things
like
pain
and
suffering
and
emotional
distress,
which
are
tort
like
concepts.
the
current
proliferation
of
conflicting
decisions
among
the
courts
of
appeals
really
provides
a
compelling
justification
for
deference
to
the
agency's
interpretations,
because
currently,
instead
of
deferring
to
the
agency's
rulings,
the
courts
are
independently
struggling
to
determine
what
is
a
tort
like
remedy.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
it's
a
title
vii
remedy,
that
for
a--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--portion
of
title
vii
it
provides
additional
compensation,
then
it
qualifies
as
a
tort
like
remedy.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
only
back
pay,
and
i
think
i
can
explain
that,
but
it's
complicated.
in
evaluating
the
loss
involved
in
a
personal
injury,
the
award
of
the
lost
stream
of
income
is
a
relevant
indicator
of
what
was
lost,
of
the
value
of
what
was
lost,
and
so
we
can't
ignore,
the
service
can't
ignore--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
talking--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
talking
in
the
traditional
sense.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
it's
straight
back
pay
less
whatever
earnings
you
made
in
the
interim.
it's
sort
of
like
the
lost
flow
of
income.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
sounds
correct,
and
i
also
want
to
emphasize--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
it
sounds
correct
that
your
literal
interpretation
of
the
statute
makes
some
sense,
but
what
i
want
to
emphasize
is
that
the
hypothetical
that
you've
postulated
doesn't
really
have
enough
information
in
it
for
me
to
feel
like
i
can
offer
a
firm
view
of
how
the
service
would
react
to
it.
i
think
that
there's
a
lot
of
slippage
in
the
way
you've
described
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
there's
one
other
point
that
i
just
have
to
talk
about
briefly,
because
it's
a
very
important
point
to
the
commissioner,
and
that
is
that
liquidated
damages
should
be
excluded
from
income
for
an
additional
reason,
which
is
that
their
award
only
for
wilful
violations
is
analogous
to
punitive
damages
and
private
fines.
in
commissioner
v.
glenshaw
glass,
the
court
concluded
that
damages
on
account
of
personal
injury
are
by
definition
compensatory
only.
chief
justice
warren
stated
for
the
court
in
glenshaw
glass
that
punitive
damages
are
not
akin
to
a
return
of
capital,
which
was
the
original
justification
for
the
statute,
and
that
they
do
not
represent
compensation
on
account
of
personal
injuries.
these
statutes
are
of
the
type
that
the
court
has
traditionally
said
are
to
be
narrowly
construed.
as
we've
described
in
our
brief,
consistent
with
the
text,
the
structure
and
the
history
of
the
statute,
it
should
be
interpreted
only
to
exclude
compensation
on
account
of
income,
on
account
of
injuries,
and
should
not
be
interpreted
to
exclude
punitive
awards
made
on
account
of
the
employer's
or
the
defendant's
improper
state
of
mind.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you.
just
briefly,
justice
ginsburg,
i
wanted
to
point
out
that
the
irony
that
you
referred
to
may
be
even
broader
than
you
noted.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that,
under
norfolk
and
western,
if
the
recovery
were
tax
exempt
the
jury
should
be
instructed
of
that,
is
the
fact
that
under
brooklyn
savings,
if
the
reward
were
excluded
from
tax
it
would
be
regarded
as
compensatory
and
therefore
prejudgment
interest
would
not
be
permitted.
currently,
pre
judgment
interest
is
allowed
on
adea
claims
because
the
liquidated
damages
component
is
regarded
as
punitive
rather
than
as
compensatory,
but
if
it
were
regarded
as
exempt
because
it
compensated
for
personal
losses,
it
would
fall
precisely
within
the
brooklyn
savings
holding
that
precludes
prejudgment
interest.
there
are
two
steps
involved
in
applying
this
statute,
as
there
are
in
almost
every
tax
statute
that
provides
an
exclusion
from
income.
because
such
statutes
have
to
be
narrowly
construed,
the
transaction
has
to
meet
both
the
form
and
the
substance
that
congress
describes.
the
form
of
such
a
transaction
in
this
context
is
the
nature
of
the
claim,
the
threlkeld
test.
the
court
went
beyond
the
form
of
the
claim
in
burke
and
said
it
also
has
to
meet
the
substance
of
the
statute.
it
has
to
provide
remedies
for
the
personal
components
of
the
loss,
because
otherwise,
if
it
just
compensates
for
the
economic
components,
it
doesn't
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
statute
as
it
should
be
strictly
construed.
that
is
the
sum
and
substance
of
the
internal
revenue
service's
position.
i
disagree,
and
our
brief
reflects
the
fact
that
we
disagree
with
the
respondent
about
whether
we
had
been
inconsistent.
i
think
that
our
brief...
i'll
have
to
rely
on
it
for
that,
but
i
do
want
to
point
out
specifically
that
since
1972,
in
rulings
involving
what
was
then
title
vii
provisions
and
flsa
provisions,
the
service
ruled
that
if
the
statutory
remedy
only
provides
back
wages
and
an
equal
amount
of
liquidated
damages
and
doesn't
compensate
for
the
personal
components,
then
it's
not
a
recovery
on
account
of
personal
injuries.
it's
not
a
tort
like
remedy
within
the
meaning
of
the
regulation
or
the
statute.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
as
you've
described
it,
i'm
confident
that
our
position
would
be
that
it
is
an
economic
recovery,
but
i'm
not--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
not
sure
that
i
can
think
of
an
exact...
a
ruling
on
that
point.
