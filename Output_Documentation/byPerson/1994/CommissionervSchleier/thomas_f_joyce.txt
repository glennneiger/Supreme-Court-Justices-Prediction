mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
one
of
the
central
problems
of
this
case
was
identified
in
justice
ginsburg's
questioning
with
regard
to
the
1991
civil
rights
amendments
and
the
statutes
that
emerged
from
that
legislation.
in
fact,
this
case
presents
the
issue
what
sense
does
it
make
to
treat
plaintiffs
under
the
adea
differently
from
plaintiffs
under
other
similar
federal
antidiscrimination
statutes?
as
i
said,
the
statutes
that
emerged
from
that
legislation
are
a
unified
scheme
embodying
congressional
policy
against
discrimination,
against
racial,
sexual,
disabilities
discrimination,
as
well
as
against
age
discrimination.
the
fundamental
principal
of
a
tax
system
that
similarly
situated
taxpayers
should
be
taxed
similarly--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--it
was,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
not
at
all.
in
fact,
we
have
relied
on
burke
in
all
of
the
lower
courts.
the
fundamental
principle
that
similarly
situated
taxpayers
should
be
taxed
similarly
finds
direct
application
in
the
post
1991
federal
antidiscrimination
scheme.
if
a
cluster
of
laws
enacted
by
congress
are
now
being
interpreted
by
the
internal
revenue
service
to
allow
for
tax
free
damages,
as
they
are
in
revenue
ruling
93
88,
what
sense
does
it
make
to
take
one
element
out
of
that
cluster
which
congress
and
i
think
an
objective
observer
would
regard
as
similar
and
treat
it
differently.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
they
are
different.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
they
are
different,
justice
stevens,
but
the
remedies...
and
i
emphasize
the
remedies,
because
burke
did
speak
in
terms
of
remedial
schemes.
the
remedies
of
the
adea
are
much
more
similar
to
the
remedies
under
post
1991
title
vii
and
the
disabilities
act
than
any
of
those
laws'
remedies
are
to
the
paradigms
of
unlimited
state
tort
liability.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
yes,
you
can,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
if
i
may
correct
you,
your
honor,
punitive
damages
as
well
as
pain
and
suffering
under
post
1991
law
are
kept.
one
can
obtain
a
maximum
under
any
circumstances
of
300,000.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
i--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--i
agree
with
your
honor
that
they
are
not
alike,
just
as
title
vii's
remedial
scheme
is
not
exactly
the
same
as
the
disabilities
act.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
well--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--your
honor,
we
don't
feel
that
there
is
an
irrational
difference
between
the
adea
and
title
vii,
or
the
disabilities
act.
as
i
said,
those
three
statutes
provide
for
a
much
more
similar
remedial
scheme.
as
an
example,
one
can
easily
imagine
a
plaintiff
under
the
adea
who
has
a
large
lost
earnings
damage
and
who,
upon
a
demonstration
of
wilful
misconduct,
will
receive
far
in
excess
of
a
plaintiff
with
similar
lost
earnings
under
title
vii,
or
the
disabilities
act.
that
illustrates
that
these
remedial...
that
the
range
of
damages
in
these
three
statutes
are
roughly
comparable,
and
in
fact
mr.
schleier's
damages,
his
liquidated
damages,
fall
somewhere
in
the
mid
range
between
the
minimum
of
50,000
required
in
some
circumstances
under
title
vii
and
the
absolute
maximum
of
300,000.
in
other
words,
one
could
imagine
a
person
with
lost
earnings
under
the
adea
in
excess
of
300,000.
if
that
person
shows
wilful
misconduct,
that
persona
will
receive
more
than
300,000
in
liquidated
damages.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
your
honor,
i'm
in
a
difficult
position
to
say
whether
a
plaintiff
who
is
a
victim
of
age
discrimination
feels
less
hurt
than
other
plaintiffs.
i
recognize
that
there
is
a
constitutional
prohibition
on
age
discrimination,
nor
is
there
one
on
gender
discrimination.
however,
congress
and
this
court
in
numerous
decisions,
such
as
eeoc
v.
wyoming,
western
airlines
v.
criswell,
has
recognized
the
dimension
of
personal
injury
in
the
age
discrimination
statute,
and
that
much
is
clear.
there
is
a
personal
injury
here.
the
law
could
not
produce
an
award
without
it.
the
internal
revenue
service
concedes
as
much
in
this
case.
there
is
an
injury
in
this
type
of
case.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
your
honor,
it
is
probably
closer
to
the
title
vii
pattern.
it
is
not
identical,
but
it
is
much
more
similar
to
title
vii.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
broader,
your
honor,
yes.
perhaps
not
necessarily
deeper,
but
it,
like
the
remedies
under
the
title
vii,
permits
for
a
separate
count
of
pain
and
suffering
and
a
separate
count
of
punitive
damages.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
your
honor,
the
reason
for
that
is
the
reason
which
i
think
has
ultimately
been
recognized
by
the
internal
revenue
service
itself
in
revenue
ruling
93
88.
once
you
have
a
tort
or
a
tort
like
cause
of
action,
as
the
regulations
state,
once
that
occurs,
any
damages,
as
the
statute
says,
are
excludable,
and
the
irs
now
explicitly
applies
that
principle
to
lost
earnings
or
back
pay
under
title
vii,
the
disabilities
act,
et
cetera.
the
mere
fact
that
the
damages
are
measured
by
the
earnings
the
tort
victim
would
have
received
does
not
prevent
the
exemption
under
section
104(a)(2).
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
no,
your
honor.
the
statute
talks
about
personal
injuries.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
the
regulations
define
that
to
mean
an
action
prosecuted
involving
tort
or
tort
type
rights.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
your
honor,
historically
it
is
true
that
personal
injuries
have
emerged
from
the
tort
law,
and
many
things
that
we
would
recognize
as
torts
or
tort
like
now
did
not
exist,
or
would
not
have
been
recognized
as
causes
of
action
in
1919
when
the
statute
was
enacted.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
we
actually
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
because
we
believe
the
court
in
burke
emphasized
not
only
must
there
be
a
tort
like
character
in
the
law,
there
has
to
be
a
personal
injury.
if
there's
no
personal
injury,
business
tort
might
qualify,
and
that's
clearly
beyond
the
reach
of
this
exemption.
there
must
be,
if
you
like,
a
two
phase
test,
or
a
two
step
test.
there
must
be
a
personal
injury.
now,
what
distinguishes
a
narrow
class
of
discrimination
laws
from
certain
other
causes
of
action
is
that
congress
has
identified
by
law
certain
injuries
that
are
deemed
to
occur
when
an
act
of
intentional
discrimination
occurs.
a
person
is...
a
person's
intangible
security
is
invaded
with
respect
to
a
fundamental
feature
of
his
or
her
identity,
and
that's
what
happens
in
unlawful
racial,
gender,
age
discrimination.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
yes,
your
honor.
that
tort,
which
is--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
tort
is
not
necessarily
within
the
reach
of
this
exemption.
if
one
business
sues
another
business
citing
that
tort,
there
may
be
no
personal
injury.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
you
may
very
well
have,
but
i
question
under
your
hypothetical
whether
it
is
a
personal
injury.
if
it
is,
then
maybe
we
have
something
to
apply
here,
but
if
not,
the
statute
cannot
be
invoked.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
a
right
to
contract
is--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
what
you're
getting
at
may
be
that
the
statute
uses
the
term
personal
injury.
personal
injury
both
now
and
historically
has
been
something
of
a
term
of
art.
it
does
not--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
and
this
is
where
the
threlkeld
case,
for
example--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--provides
a
guide.
in
that
case,
which
was
a
lower
court
opinion,
obviously,
cited
by
this
court
in
burke,
threlkeld
emphasized
there
must
be
some
type
of
fundamental
injury
to
the
human
identity.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
yes,
your
honor,
something
that
rises
to
the
level
of
an
intangible
or
a
physical
invasio
of
security.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
your
honors
have
asked
two
questions.
over
70
would
not
be
within
the
reach
of
the
age
statute.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
okay.
that
may
very
well
be,
your
honor.
if
you
decide
to
single
them
out
for
that
act
and
violate
the
law,
you
have
undoubtedly
injured
them.
as
to
what
it
means--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--oh,
i
think
you
may
very
well
have.
obviously,
each
case
may
be
slightly
different,
but
when
you
fire
somebody
because
he
or
she
is
determined
arbitrarily
to
be
too
old,
you're
telling
that
person
he
no
longer
is
a
productive
human
being...
it's
time
to
retire.
go
out
to
pasture,
you're
no
good...
and
that's
the
injury
we
think
congress
was
aiming
at.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
let
me
explain,
your
honor.
in
that
situation,
the
state
circumscribes
a
remedy,
or
recognizes
a
cause
of
action,
but
does
not
have
a
separate
count
for
pain
and
suffering.
is
that
tort
like?
is
it
within
the
reach
of
the
exemption?
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
on
account
of,
perhaps
somewhat
different
from
the
phrase
personal
injuries,
is
not
a
precise
term
of
art.
however--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
there
is
a
loose
notion
of
causation
underlying
that
term.
if
there
had
been
no
personal
injury,
there
would
be
no
damages.
that
is
what
we
believe
congress--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--i
believe
that
was
not
addressed
in
the
1918
legislative
history.
i
think
most
courts
that
have
adjudicated
this,
and
the
irs
itself,
now
seems
to
be
relying
on
this
idea
in
revenue
ruling
93
88,
where
it
held
that
back
pay
alone
in
a
statute
that
is
otherwise
within
the
coverage
of
this
exemption
is
excludable.
so
if
you
had
a
statute
that
was,
as
your
honor
is
hypothesizing,
otherwise
satisfying
the
elements
of
this,
there
is
sufficient
causality
to
cause
the
measure
of
the
damage
that
is
expressed
in
terms
of
lost
earnings
to
be
within
the
reach
of
it,
because
the
statute
does
say,
any
damages
on
account,
so
once
there
is
a
personal
injury,
any
means
any.
that
is
what
we
believe,
and
what
the
irs--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--which
individual,
the--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--you
do
not
have
to
show,
necessarily,
that
the
person
was
aware
of
that.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
right.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
yes,
your
honor.
that
injury--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--he
is,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--i
disagree
in
one
respect,
your
honor,
respectfully.
congress
presumes
an
injury
to
occur
when
invidious
discrimination
in
violation
of
one
of
these
classifications
occurs.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
it
does,
your
honor,
because
there
has
to
be
an
act
of
discrimination.
there
must
be
an
act
of
discrimination,
and
there
must
be
injury
in
this
case.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
well,
i
think
justice
scalia
is
hypothesizing
a
case
in
which
it
is
quite
possible
a
plaintiff
may
not
be
aware
that
the
act
is
a
violation
of
the
adea.
at
least,
that
was
my
interpretation.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
it
is
highly
likely
that
by
that
point
the
plaintiff
will
be
aware
of
it.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
also
think
that's
the
law
generally
that
the
jury
will
be
informed
of
that.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
it
is
possible
that
the
tortfeasor
in
the
age
case
just
like
the
tortfeasor
in
any
tort
case
may
have
to
pay
less
to
the
victims.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
that
would
probably
be
the
charge
in
an
age
case,
your
honor.
if
i
could
emphasize,
justice
ginsburg,
in
any
tort
case
it
is
possible
we
don't
know
in
advance
whether
there'll
be
any
incidental
benefit
to
the
tortfeasor,
but
the
tortfeasor
may
have
to
pay
less
money.
if
the
victims
are
in
a
very
strong
bargaining
position
they
will
want
a
certain
sum.
they
will
have
a
very
strong
case,
and
if
the
employer
or
defendant
has
to
pay
that
but
is
relieved
in
some
sense
because
the
primary
beneficiaries
are
relieved
of
that
tax,
we
believe
that
is
an
unintended
incidental
benefit
not
primarily
before
congress.
the
regulations
we
emphasize,
your
honors,
must
be
interpreted
as
they
speak
in
terms
of
tort
like
laws,
and
this
illustrates
why
they
must
be
interpreted
flexibly.
it
is
not
simply
tort
laws
that
existed
in
1919
or
1956,
or
any
particular
date,
but
a
range
of
tort
laws
that
must
be
accommodated
under
this
statute.
that
would
include
not
only
presumed
damages
under
various
state
laws
or
the
circumscribed
tort
remedies
hypothesized
by
some
members
of
the
court
today,
but
even
such
causes
of
action
as
wrongful
death.
wrongful
death
is
a
good
example
of
a
statute
or
a
remedy
that
has
in
many
cases
no
xx
for
pain
and
suffering.
it
is,
however,
frequently
recognized
by
the
irs
as
being
within
the
coverage
of
this
exemption.
for
example,
revenue
ruling
84
108
recognizes
as
much.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
not
all
tort...
or
i
believe
not
all
wrongful
death
statutes
do
that,
your
honor.
just
as
one
example
we
cited
a
colorado
statute
that
was
enacted
in
our
brief.
the
federal
employers
liability
act
also,
i
believe,
does
not
provide
a
separate
count
for
pain
and
suffering,
and
that
illustrates
a
recognized
tort
like
frame,
namely
those
wrongful
death
statutes
that
would
apparently
not
come
within
coverage,
even
though
the
government
has
otherwise
recognized
such
statutes
to
be
tort
like
for
purposes
of
the
section
104(a)(2)
exemption,
incidentally
illustrating,
we
feel,
another
inconsistency
between
the
government's
litigating
position
in
this
case
and
its
published
revenue
rulings.
your
honor--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--wrongful
death
is
a
particularly
clear
example
of
it,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
the
ones
that
i
mentioned,
the
colorado
statute
we
cited
in
our
brief,
the
wrongful
death
statute
in
revenue
ruling
84
108,
the
federal
employer's
liability--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--well,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
revenue
ruling
84
108,
which
dealt
with
two
wrongful
death
statutes...
one
is
a
virginia
statute
and
one
is
alabama.
the
virginia
statute,
according
to
the
ruling,
states
that
there
shall
be
compensation
only
for
actual
damages.
there
wasn't
a
great
deal
of
detail.
the
government
in
the
course
of
its
analysis
in
that
ruling
cited
the
norfolk
&
western
v.
liepelt
case,
which
is
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
that's
cited
in
our
brief.
that
statute,
as
well,
does
not
allow
for
pain
and
suffering.
the
government,
nevertheless,
in
revenue
ruling
84
108,
concluded
that
the
virginia
statute--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--well,
we
think
so,
your
honor,
but
the
government
has
taken
the
position
for
this
case
that
there
is
an
absolute
prerequisite
under
the
burke
analysis
that
there
be
a
count
for
something
like
pain
or
suffering.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
that
may
be.
we
feel
that
that
does
not--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--nevertheless,
we
feel
that
illustrates
why
the
government's
insistence
on
the
presence
of
a
pain
and
suffering
count,
as
it
were,
is
improper,
is
incorrect.
indeed,
the
government's
position
in
its
reply
brief
most
explicitly
seeks
deference
from
this
court
with
respect
to
its
view.
there
is,
however,
no
regulation
addressing
the
age
discrimination
statute.
there's
no
revenue
ruling.
there's
no
published
announcement.
what
the
government
is
seeking
deference
to
in
this
case
is
its
litigating
position.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
it
is
entitled
to
deference
with
respect
to
agency
views
that
first
of
all
interpret
a
statute
to
which
congress
has--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--within
limits
it
is,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
we
feel
the
government
is
not
entitled
to
deference
because
first
of
all
its
litigating
position
is
what
it's
asking
deference
to.
that
position
is
apparently
at
odds
with...
not
only
with
statements
in
the
court
below,
but
published
revenue
rulings,
and
furthermore--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--oh,
i
think
so,
your
honor.
just
as
an
example,
the
government
does
not
seem
to
have
a
consistent...
completely
consistent
view
as
to
whether
liquidated
damages
are
exclusively
punitive
or
not.
as
part
of
its
argument,
the
government
has
stated
that
the
portal
to
portal
act
transformed
flsa
liquidated
damages,
therefore
affecting
adea
liquidated
damages,
while
25
years
ago
it
said
something
different.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
from
what
i've
heard,
no,
because
the
government
is
going
contrary
to
the
decision
in
burke.
burke,
i
would
just
for
the
sake
of
recapitulation
emphasize
that
there
must
be
some
elements
of
a
tort
like
remedial
scheme
in
addition
to
a
personal
injury.
the
court
singled
out
jury
trials
because
of
the
importance
of
damages.
it
emphasized
a
range
of
nonwage
damages.
it
also
cited
the
existence
of
punitive
damages
as
one
of
the
indicia.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
yes.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
well,
the
reason
i
think
that
is
not
the
case,
justice
souter,
is
first
of
all
the
court
did
cite
the
rickel
case,
an
age
discrimination
appellate
decision,
and
the
court
also
had
as
a
background,
as
it
were,
the
post
1991
amendments
showing
how
the
addition
of
certain
features
to
a
remedial
scheme
can
apparently
transform
the
character
of
the
damages.
there
is
a
role
for
the
jury
in
the
age
case.
the
jury
not
only
finds
whether
discrimination
may
occur,
but
the
jury
has
a
role
in
the
determination
of
wilfulness
on
the
part
of
the
defendant.
as
this
court
noted
in
burke,
punitive
damages
may
be
an
important
part
of
tort
law,
both
historically
and
currently,
and
so
that
is
why
i
can't
speak
precisely
as
to
what
the
court
may
have
had
in
mind
in
its
majority
opinion.
we
feel
that
it
was
looking
largely
beyond
the
title
vii
statute
at
issue
in
that
case.
it
was
looking
for
a,
as
it
said,
a
range
of
damages.
it
cited,
again,
i
think
on
page
1873
of
the
opinion,
the
importance
of
having
additional
damages,
including
other
consequential
damages.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
it
is
one
other
remedy
which,
under
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
brooklyn
savings,
overnight
motor,
was
held
to
denote
too
difficult
to
measure,
too
obscure
except
for
estimate
by
liquidated
damages.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
well--
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
--i
understand
your
honor's
point.
i
still
don't
think
that's
what
the
court
really
had
in
mind,
because
if
that
were
so,
various
other
presumed
damages
such
as
defamation,
defamation
per
se,
that
doctrine,
would
automatically
be
excluded
from
the
reach
of
this
statute,
and
as
i
indicated
earlier,
even
other
tort
like
statutes
such
as
wrongful
death
are
automatically
beyond
the
reach,
unless
they
provide
a
separate
count.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
it
is
a
matter
of
arithmetic
once
there's
a
finding
of
wilfulness.
mr.
thomas
f.
joyce
and
as
to
whether,
for
that
matter,
congress
decided
to
leave
the
apparent
equation
of
the
degree
of
reprehensibility
to
the
existence
of
damages,
though
the
court
in
the
schmitz
case,
for
example,
concluded
that
that
was
in
fact
what
was
going
on,
that
there
is
a
presumed
association
with
a
degree
of
bad
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
tortfeasor
with
those
additional
damages
suffered
by
the
plaintiff,
and
there
is
a
role,
a
very
distinct
role
for
jury
discretion
in
that
case,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
cede
the
remainder
of
my
time.
