chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
94
500,
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
v.
erich
schleier,
and
helen
b.
schleier.
mr.
jones.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
liquidated
damages
in
traditional
contract
law
often
means
a
sum
that
is
awarded
because
the
actual
damages
would
be
very
difficult
to
assess,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
jones.
mr.
joyce.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
burke
was
a
title
vii
claim,
wasn't
it,
or
a
pre
1991
title
vii?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you're
not
quarreling
with
that
decision,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
statute
doesn't
talk
about
tort
like
injuries,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
personal
injuries.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
if
you
just
look
at
the
term
personal
injuries,
you
think
of
it,
you
know,
in
terms
of
the
sort
of
thing
that
comes
as
a
result
of,
say,
a
typical
automobile
accident...
you
break
your
arm,
you
know,
you
can't
walk
right
afterwards...
not
the
sort
of
damages
that
you're
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
as
i
say,
the
statute
doesn't
say
tort
like.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statute
says...
so
i
don't
know
that
it's
necessarily
correct
to
say
that
anything
you
call
tort
like
is
a
personal
injury
under
the
statute.
the
internal
revenue
service
has
said
that,
and
we
may
well
choose
to
follow
their
regulation,
but
it
certainly
doesn't
inexorably
follow
from
the
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
the
tort
of
malicious
interference
with
contractual
relations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
really
is
economic,
isn't
it,
entirely?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
i'm
a
defendant
in
an
action
like
that,
or
a
plaintiff
in
an
action,
and
you
know,
i'm
not
a
company,
i'm
simply
an
individual.
i
certainly
sustain
some
sort
of
injury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
since
lord
campbell's
act
and
lord
tenterden's
act,
wrongful
death
does
compensate
for
pain
and
suffering,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
those
were
changes
in
the
19th
century,
i
thought.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
it
entitled
to
deference
in
interpreting
its
own
regulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
my
question
was,
isn't
it
entitled
to
deference
in
interpreting
its
own
regulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
has
it
been
inconsistent
in
its
interpretation
of
its
regulations
as
applied
to
this
particular
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
government...
if
it
turned
out
that
we
felt
the
government
were
consistent
in
interpreting
its
regulation,
would
it
then
be
entitled
to
deference
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
that
was
on
the
tort
side,
but
certainly
it
did
not
dispense
with
the
requirement
that
the
injuries
be
personal
injuries.
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
the
court
in
that
case
and
we
think
in
other
cases
has
presumed
certain
personal
injuries
to
occur
in
an
act
of
invidious
discrimination,
and
the
government
has
conceded
as
much
here.
what
burke
said
in
addition,
and
in
this
respect
adding
an
additional
test
beyond
that
advanced
by
justices
o'connor
and
thomas
in
their
dissent,
was
that
there
must
be
an
additional
tort
like
frame.
that
frame
the
court
in
burke
derived
from
the
remedial
scheme,
and
those
elements
of
the
remedial
scheme
found
to
be
absent
in
the
burke
case
are
present
here.
there
are
jury
trials,
there
is
a
range
of
nonwage
damages,
and
depending
on
how
one
weighs
the
compensatory
versus
punitive
aspects
of
the
adea,
there
in
fact
is
a
punitive
role
for
adea
liquidated
damages,
and
so
that
brings
this
case
squarely
within
the
analysis
of
the
majority
in
burke.
well,
may
i
suggest
another
reading?
was
both
the
emphasis
in
burke
on
jury
trial
and
the
emphasis
on
some
range
of
headings
of
damages
intended
to
point
to
a
case
like
the
typical
tort
personal
injury
case
in
which
the
jury
has
a
considerable
degree
of
discretion
in
determining
what
something
is
worth,
e.g.,
what
pain
and
suffering
is
worth,
whereas
in
a
case
like
this,
number
1,
as
you
said
a
moment
ago,
i
presume
the
jury
must
be
instructed
with
respect
to
the
wage
aspect
of
the
claim,
that
they
are
simply
to
make
the
claimant
whole,
which
is
pretty
much
a
mathematical
exercise
if
the
jury
follows
its
instructions?
and
number
2,
assuming
that
it
finds
wilfulness,
the
wilfulness
once
again
is
pretty
much
a
matter
of
math
once
the
wage
claim
has
been
given
a
figure,
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
joyce.
mr.
jones,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
94-500
commissioner
of
internal
revenue
versus
schleier
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
