mr.
warren,
would
you
explain
how
the
proceeding
on
the
bond
will
affect
the
bankruptcy
estate?
what
are
the
ways
in
which
it
will?
the
money
northbrook
has
to
pay
is
outside
the
bankruptcy
estate,
of
course,
so
how
will
it
affect
the
bankruptcy
estate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
was
pledged
are
funds
that
otherwise
would
be
in
the
general
bankruptcy
estate.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
if
the
respondents
had
just
executed
on
their
judgment,
that
would
not
have
been
anything
that
would
be
covered
by
the
stay,
i
take
it,
of
the
bankruptcy
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
would
have
been
the
situation
had
there
been
no
supersedeas
bond?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
have
precluded
any
execution
of
the
judgment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
bond
was
then
obtained
prior
to
the
filing
of
bankruptcy,
to
enable
the
respondents
to
go
ahead
and...
and
obtain
their
money
on
the
basis
of
the
supersedeas
bond.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
do
you
say
the
test
for
whether
it
is
related
to
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
is
the
test
employed
by
the
third
circuit
in
pacor
v.
higgins?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
all
the
courts
of
appeal
apply
that
same
test,
or
is
there
some
diversity--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--among
the
circuits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
only
conceivable
effect
here
is
if
celotex
can
establish
that
its
transfer
of
the
collateral
to
northbrook
was
a
fraudulent
transfer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
rosenthal,
did
you
ever
file
a
motion
in
the
florida
bankruptcy
court
seeking
relief
from
the
injunction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
didn't
you
follow
that
procedure
on
behalf
of
these
respondents?
