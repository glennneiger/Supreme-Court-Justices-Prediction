justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
warren,
the
estate
would
get
back
that
property
pledged,
i
assume,
only
if
there's
some
invalidity
in
the
pledge,
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
there
thought
to
be
some
invalidity
in
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
those
claims
seeking
to
bring
back
those...
the
judgment
has
already
been
rendered
with
regard
to
those
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it
for
the
indirect
benefit
of
the
edwardses?
if
the
bond
had
not
been
posted,
the
edwardses
would
have
executed--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
the
money
would
have
been
gone.
so
how
does
it
benefit
the
edwardses?
it
seems
to
me
it
was
entirely
for
the
benefit
of
celotex,
to
enable
it
not
to
have
to
pay
the
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
concerned
with
the
insolvent
status,
i
give
you
that,
but
what
conceivable
basis
is
there
for
arguing
that
it
was
not
for
the
benefit
of
celotex,
which
is
a
necessary
condition
to
say
that,
you
know,
that
somehow
this
thing
could
be
called
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
please
help
me.
i
really
don't
understand
this.
isn't
it
the
case
that
despite
celotex's
insolvency
the
judgment
could
have
been
executed
upon?
justice
antonin
scalia
absent
the
posting
of
the
bond.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
that
jurisdiction
existed
if
there
was
a
colorable
claim
that
the
property
could
come
into
the
estate,
and
this
is
where
i
find
i
have
difficulty.
you're
saying
it
is
a
colorable
claim
so
long
as
the
property
used
to
belong
to
the
bankrupt.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
even
without...
without
any
assertion
of
facts
that
would
somehow
demonstrate
that
there's
a
real
possibility
that
the
property
could
be
included
within
the
bankruptcy
estate,
even
without
that,
it
is
still
related
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
doesn't
say,
might
be
related
to.
it
says,
related
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it
reasonable
to
interpret
that
to
mean
that
there
must
be
some
facts
that
would
give
rise
to
a
colorable
claim
that
the
money
can
be
recovered
by
the
bankrupt
estate?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
are
they
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
--preferential
transfer
that
consists
of
a
payment
of
a
judgment?
do
you
know
any
case
where
a
payment
of
a
judgment
has
been
set
aside?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
warren,
let
me
ask
you
this
hypothetical.
suppose...
suppose
there's
a
piece
of
property
that
celotex
sold
10
years
ago,
and
it
sold
it
with
a
condition
subsequent,
that
if
a
certain
event
occurred,
the
property
would
revert
to
celotex.
there
is
now
pending
a
lawsuit
between
two
third
parties
who
have
nothing
to
do
with
celotex
or
northbrook
or
anybody
else,
involving
ownership
of
this
property.
could
the
bankruptcy
court
stay
that
proceeding
on
the
theory
that
since
there
was
this
reversionary
provision,
although
there's
no
reason
whatever
to
believe
that
the
event
which
would
produce
the
reversion
has
occurred...
no
reason
whatever
to
believe
that...
nonetheless,
it
is
related
to
the
bankruptcy?
could
that
be
stayed?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
related
to
just
means,
what,
it
means
somehow
the
bankrupt's
property
is
involved?
justice
antonin
scalia
conceivable
regardless
of
reality?
i
mean,
you
can
make
up
facts--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
that's
one
reason
it
couldn't
have
any
conceivable
effect.
another
reason
it
couldn't
have
conceivable
effect
is
that
there
is
no
way
in
the
world
that
the
claim
which
would
bring
it
back
into
the
state
could
be
vindicated,
so
that
if
i
feel
that
way
about
whether
there
was
consideration
given
for
the
posting
of
this
security,
whether
not
having
to
pay
it
immediately
is
adequate
consideration,
i
have
brought
this
case
parallel
with
the
hypothetical
i
just
gave
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
it
is
patently
frivolous.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
isn't
it
patently
frivolous
here
if
there
is...
was,
indeed,
equivalent
value
given
for
the
posting
of
the
security?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
warren,
if
i
hear
you
correctly,
you
are
not
arguing
that
there
is
no
possibility...
no
realistic
possibility,
no
argument,
that
northbrook
cannot
be
prevented
from
executing
a
bond
collateral.
you
acknowledge
that
there
may
be
a
basis,
after
you
collect
from
northbrook,
for
saying
that
northbrook
has
no
right
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
you
haven't
made
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
argue
on
the
basis
of
lack
of
relationship,
not
the
fact
that
there
may
not
be
some
plausible
basis
for
thinking
that
northbrook
can't
use
the
collateral.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
would
you
not
agree,
at
least
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction,
the
bankruptcy
court
would
at
least
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
northbrook
from
trying
to
realize
on
the
collateral?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
accurate
enough
to
say
that
the
fifth
circuit
is
not
saying
that
the
bankruptcy
court
was
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
only
saying
that
the
texas
court
was
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
him
who
can
read
conclude
that
therefore
the
other
court
was
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying,
i
take
it,
that
a
bankruptcy
court
that
unquestionably
has
jurisdiction
over
the
parties
before
it
does
not
have
to
be
obeyed
by
the
district
court
who
is
entertaining
the
case
of
united
states
v.
nixon
should
that
court
happen
to
issue
an
injunction
relating
to
that
case,
which
has
no
conceivable
relationship,
even
though
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
parties?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
trying
to
trick
you.
[laughter]
what
i
don't
understand,
though,
about
your
position,
is
this.
if
it
had
been
your
contention
that
there's
no
way
in
which
northbrook
would
not
be
entitled
to
retain
the
collateral
after
it
pays
the
bond,
then...
then
i
might
go
along
with
you,
but
you
are
not
making
that
argument.
you
are
perfectly
willing
to
entertain
the
possibility
that
northbrook
will
pay
the
bond
and
then
get
left
high
and
dry
at
the
other
end
of
the
transaction
by
not
being
able
to
retain
its
collateral.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
whole
purpose
of
this
provision
that
enables
the
bankruptcy
court
to
have
jurisdiction
over
all
proceedings
related
to
cases
is
to
prevent
just
that
kind
of
thing
from
happening,
to
prevent
inconsistent
determinations
by
courts
with
respect
to
the
same
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
asked
you
earlier
whether
you
were
making
any
of
those
arguments
that
in
fact
there's
no
colorable
basis
for
saying
that
northbrook
doesn't
own
this
collateral,
and
you
said
no,
that's
not
the
argument
you're
making.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
hasn't
preserved
the
status
quo.
the
status
quo
is
that
every...
that
this
money
was
gone.
the
status
quo
is
that
once
the
security
was
posted,
the
case
was
lost
on
appeal,
that
money
was
gone,
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
saying
no,
the
money
isn't
gone.
i
don't
call
that
recaining
the
status
quo.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
gone
unless
there's
some
colorable
basis
for
getting
it
back.
