chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
this
morning
in
number
93-1504,
the
celotex
corporation
v.
bennie
edwards.
mr.
warren.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
position
is
that
if
the
edwardses
thought
the
bankruptcy
court
was
wrong,
they
should
appeal
to
the
eleventh...
the
district
court
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
not
take
it
up
in
the
fifth
circuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
the
edwardses
get
away
from
this,
then?
supposing
that
they
had
actually
been...
the
bond
had
paid
them
off,
paid
off
their
judgment,
could
the
bankruptcy
court
still
come
after
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
warren.
mr.
rosenthal,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
can
argue
in
the
bankruptcy
court
that
the
stay
shouldn't
have
issued.
you
can
appeal
to
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
that
supervises
the
bankruptcy
court.
i
mean,
it's
not
as
if
the
bankruptcy
court
makes
a
wrong
decision
you're
just
permanently
stuck
with
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
congress
shouldn't
have
worded
it
as
related
to.
i
mean,
you
know,
i
think
your
argument
is
basically
you
don't
like
the
breadth
of
jurisdiction
conveyed...
conferred
by
congress.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
nonetheless,
if
northbrook
goes
against
celotex
as
a
result
of
your
collecting
on
the
bond
because
of
the
collateral
that
celotex...
that
could
diminish
the
celotex
bankruptcy
estate,
could
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
rosenthal,
on
rehearing,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit,
in
its
amendment
to
the
opinion,
its
last
couple
of
sentences
say,
"thus,
we
have
not
held
that
the
bankruptcy
court
in
florida
was
necessarily
wrong,
we
have
only
concluded
that
the
district
court,
over
which
we
do
have
appellate
jurisdiction,
was
right.
"
do
you
defend
that
analysis
of
the
matter?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
that
court
have
jurisdiction?
i
mean,
supposing
a
court
with
conceded
jurisdiction,
say
a
federal
court
with
diversity
jurisdiction
under
the
statute,
issues
an
injunction
which
does
not
comply
with
rule
65,
and
that
judgment
simply
becomes
final
without
any
appeal,
could
the
object
of
the...
the
person
who
is
constrained
by
the
injunction
challenge
that
collaterally
because
it
violated
rule
65?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
if
a
court
does
not
comply
with
rule
65,
that
deprives
it
of
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
be
an
extraordinary
departure
from
our
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
don't
you
answer
my
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
supposing
the
bankruptcy
court
has
before
it
a
controversy
that
is
not
at
all
patently
frivolous...
that
is,
it
concededly
relates
to
the
bankruptcy...
and
issues
an
injunction
which
doesn't
comply
with
rule
65,
does
that
mean
it
can't
rely
on
the
subject
matter
of
the
controversy
before
it
to
sustain
jurisdiction,
just
because
the
injunction
didn't
comply
with
rule
65?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
don't
our
cases
say
that
if
an
injunction's
issued
in
violation
of
rule
65
you
don't
collaterally
attack
it,
you
go
back
to
the
court
that
issued
the
injunction
and
say,
this
was
wrong
because
you
didn't
comply
with
rule
65?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you're
splitting
those
apart?
you're
saying
one
is
no
jurisdiction,
the
other
is,
i
would
say
patently
frivolous?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
other
words,
an
order
that
is
patently
frivolous,
in
your
view,
and
whatever...
you
haven't
defined
that...
could
be
collaterally
attacked
even
though
the
court
which
entered
that
order
unquestionably
had
jurisdiction.
that's
an
extraordinary
doctrine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
is
it
based
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rosenthal.
mr.
warren,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
warren--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
number
93-1504
celotex
corporation
v.
edwards.
in
this
case,
bennie
and
joann
edwards
recover
the
judgment
against
the
celotex
corporation
in
the
federal
court
in
texas
on
their
claim
of
asbestos
related
personal
injuries.
celotex
posted
a
supersedeas
bond
to
stay
the
execution
of
the
judgment
on
appeal
and
immediately
after
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed
the
judgment,
celotex
filed
for
chapter
11,
bankruptcy
protection
in
the
bankruptcy
court
for
the
middle
district
of
florida.
the
bankruptcy
court
issued
a
temporary
injunction
prohibiting
the
edwards
and
other
similarly
situated
from
executing
against
the
sureties
on
celotex’s
supersedeas
bond
without
first
obtaining
the
permission
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
the
edwards
thereafter
requested
permission
of
the
texas
district
court
to
execute
against
the
surety
on
the
supersedeas
bond
in
their
case
and
permission
was
granted
by
the
district
court
and
appalled
by
the
court
of
appeals.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
fifth
circuit
and
hold
that
the
edwards
were
obliged
to
obey
the
temporary
injunction
issued
by
the
bankruptcy
court.
it
is
well
established
that
person
subject
to
an
injunctive
order
issued
by
a
court
with
jurisdiction
are
expected
to
obey
that
decree
until
it
is
modified
or
reversed,
even
if
they
have
proper
grounds
to
object
to
the
order.
the
bankruptcy
court
here
have
jurisdiction
to
issue
the
temporary
injunction
because
the
edwards
proceeding
against
the
surety
on
the
supersedeas
bond
is
at
least
related
to
celotex
bankruptcy
within
the
meaning
of
the
appropriate
statutory
section.
we
don’t
address
here
whether
the
bankruptcy
court
acted
properly
in
issuing
the
temporary
injunction.
the
bankruptcy
court’s
orders
are
to
be
respected
until
its
decision
is
reversed
for
error
by
orderly
review,
which
must
be
conducted
in
the
federal
courts
in
florida
and
not
in
the
federal
courts
in
texas.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion,
which
is
joined
by
justice
ginsburg.
