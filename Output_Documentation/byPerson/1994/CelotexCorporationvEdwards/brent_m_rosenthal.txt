mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
in
this
case
is
that
the
fifth
circuit
properly
declined
to
follow
the
bankruptcy
court's
stay
order
because
the
bankruptcy
court
lacked
jurisdiction
to
stay
proceedings
by
the
edwardses
against
northbrook,
and
i
would
respond
to
a
comment
that
justice
kennedy
made
earlier,
we
are
claiming
a
patent
jurisdictional
defect
in
the
stay
order,
which
was
issued
5
days
after
the
bankruptcy.
we
are
claiming
that
the
bankruptcy
court
had
no
jurisdiction,
and
it
is
patent
that
the
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
i
personally
did
on
behalf
of
other
clients,
not
on
behalf
of
the
edwards.
our
firm
represents
numerous
clients
who
have...
who
had
at
the
time
of
the
bankruptcy
appeals
that
were
pending--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--because
it
was
our
opinion,
your
honor,
that
the
bankruptcy
court
had
patently
no
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
proceedings
that
did
not
involve
the
debtor
at
all,
and
that
were
not
directed
against
the
debtor,
or
against
the
debtor's
property.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
it
had
no
jurisdiction
to
do
that
as
to
northbrook,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
i...
i
can't
dispute
the
fact
that
the
bond
has
been
collateralized,
but
i
do
believe
that
at
the
time
of
the
affirmance
of
the
judgment
celotex
lost
whatever
interest
it
had
in
the
bond
itself.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
i
do
disagree
with
that
assertion,
your
honor.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
yes.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
right.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
we're
not
seeking
the
collateral.
we're
only
seeking
to
enforce
the
independent
obligation
of
northbrook
to
us.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
well,
that's
all
that's
necessary
for
jurisdiction
under
the
pacor
test,
which
says
any
proceeding
whose
outcome
could
conceivably
affect
the
bankruptcy
estate
is--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--well,
i
think
the--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--well,
that's
up
to
northbrook,
your
honor.
i
think
that
if
northbrook
enforces
that,
i
think
maybe--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--as
between
us--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--no,
there's
no,
but
as
between
us
bleeding
to
death
and
northbrook
bleeding
to
death,
i
think
the
bond,
the
obligation
that
northbrook
entered
into
to
us,
puts
northbrook
in
the
shoes
of
bleeding--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--well,
my
argument
is
that
there
is
a
limit
on
that...
on
the
relationship,
on
the
degree
to
which
a
bankruptcy
court
can
exercise
jurisdiction
over
proceedings
which
are
tangentially
related
to
a
bankruptcy.
for
example,
in
the
pacor
case,
the
plaintiff
sued
a
defendant,
the
defendant
sued
a
codefendant
for
indemnity,
that
codefendant
went
into
chapter
11,
pacor
argued,
well,
this
proceeding...
the
plaintiff's
proceeding
against
us
is
a
proceeding
related
to
the
bankruptcy
of
the
codefendant
because
the...
if
the
plaintiff
prevails,
that
will
create
a
claim
of
indemnity
from
us
against
the
codefendant,
and
therefore
it's
related
to
a
bankruptcy,
and
under
that--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--broad
test...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
i
think
the
question
implicates
two
issues,
one
is
the
possible
success
of
the
avoidance
action,
and
the
other
is
just
the
effect
on
the
bankruptcy,
and
i
think
that
that
basis
for
the
judgment
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
claim
against
northbrook.
our
claim
is
on
northbrook's
claim
to
us.
the
very
purpose
of
the
bond
is
to
ensure
that
that
satisfaction
of
the
judgment
is
unrelated
to
the
financial
condition
of
the
debtor.
that's
built
into
the
entire
concept,
so
i
think
that--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--well,
if
the
test
for
jurisdiction
is
related-to,
then
i
think
it
does
certainly
apply.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
i
don't
deny
that,
but
i
do
believe
there
is
a
limit,
and
i
do
believe
that
that
crosses
that
limit.
and
i
think
that
the
underlying
purpose
of
a
supersedeas
bond
or
transactions
like
it,
like
the
letters
of
credit
on
which
the
new
york
clearinghouse,
the
banks
of
new
york,
filed
an
amicus
brief
saying
that
the
assertion,
not
just
the
exercise...
not
just
the
wielding
of
power,
but
the
action
assertion
of
jurisdiction,
that
very
ability,
threatens
the
viability
of
those
kinds
of
financial
transactions.
and
i
think
that
to
suggest,
to
define
related-to
as
anything
that
could
affect,
however
indirectly,
a
bankruptcy,
would
basically
give
the
bankruptcy
courts
infinite
jurisdiction.
i
don't
think
that's--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--well,
that's
true,
but
i
think,
again,
to
require
someone
who
has
a
right
on
an
independent
obligation
to
go
and
litigate
in
the
bankruptcy
court
would
undermine
the
very
purpose
of
that--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--well,
i
don't
think
that
congress'
jurisdiction
has
been
interpreted
that
broadly.
i
think
that
again,
the
pacor
case,
there
was
a
relationship
with
the
bankruptcy,
a
tangential
one,
but
the
court
held
there
was
no
jurisdiction
in
that
case,
and
that's
under
the
broadest
test
that's
been
articulated.
in
the
lemco
case
decided
by
this
court,
one
of
the
alternative
grounds
for
the
holding
was
that
the
bankruptcy
court's
attempt
to
stay
administrative
proceedings
was
unlikely
to
impair
the
bankruptcy
court's
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
property
of
the
estate,
and
i
suggest
that's
exactly
the
same
situation
here.
northbrook's
actions
may
affect
the
property
of
the
estate,
although
i
even
doubt
that,
because
i
think
the
likelihood
of
avoiding
the
transfer
is
infinitesimal,
and
i
think
that
the
avoidance
claims
were
textual,
but
that's
northbrook
v.
celotex.
our
claim
against
northbrook
does
not
affect
the
debtor's
estate
any
more
than
the
plaintiff's
claim
against
pacor
in
the
pacor
case.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
yes,
and
that
action
could
be
stayed,
as
the
bankruptcy
court
recognized
in
its
own
opinion.
again,
this...
the
purpose
of
the
supersedeas
bond
is
risk
allocation.
it
is...
and
the
court
used
language
like
this.
we're
shifting
the
battleground,
taking
the
risk
of
celotex's
future
insolvency
off
us
and
putting
it
onto
northbrook,
and
if--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--well,
the
edwardses
would
be
stayed
by
the
automatic
stay.
the
circuit
courts
are
uniform
on
that,
and
we
have
not
challenged
that,
because
the
proceeding
is
against
celotex.
as
long
as
the
matter
is
in
appeal,
the
proceeding
is
against
celotex,
not
the
bond
company.
the
difference
in
this
case
was,
the
appeal
was
decided,
the
case
was
over,
and
the
edwardses
had
a
right
to
execution
and
had
a...
had
a,
basically
a
retroactive
right
to
collect
on
the
judgment,
retroactive
to
when
they
got
the
judgment,
which
was
a
year
and
a
half
before
the
bankruptcy,
and
a
year
and
a
half
ago
the
bond
was
posted
at
that
time
as
well.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
not
formal
parties,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
yes.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
no.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
no.
the
bond
company
has
resisted
payment
on
the
bond.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
well--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--several
claimants
who
argue
a
right
to
their
bonds
have
filed
a
motion
to
lift
the
stay
to
execute
on
their
bonds,
and
they
did
this...
i
can't
say
when.
i
believe
sometime
in
1992.
the
bankruptcy
court
denied
the
motions
to
lift
the
stay,
which
is
reported
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
that,
i
believe
an
appeal
has
been
taken
from
that
order
denying
the
motion
or
the
stay,
and
it
is
still
pending
2
years
later
in
the
district
court.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
and
i
think
that
illustrates,
again,
to
embroil
us,
who
should
be
guaranteed
a
right
of
immediate
access
and
a
right
of
immediate
satisfaction
of
the
bond
and
the
right
to
the
mechanisms
provided
in
the
federal
rules
for
enforcement
of
a
bond
will
be
denied
if
the
response
is,
go
to
the
bankruptcy
court
and
litigate
in
the
bankruptcy
court.
that
dishonors
the
transaction.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
yes,
and
again
i
think
that
fact
illustrates,
or
refutes
the
claim
that
attacks
such
as
these
will
proliferate,
or
affirmance
of
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
will
encourage
persons
to
make
these
kinds
of
attacks
on
bankruptcy
court
orders.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
in
most
circumstances,
yes,
your
honor,
it
would
be.
in
a
case
of
what
we
believe
to
be
patent
excursion
beyond
jurisdictional
limits,
we
say
that
this
procedure
is
appropriate,
that
the
checks
on
the
ability,
or...
and
the
restraints
on
the
willingness
of
people
to
make,
these
kinds
of
parties
to
make
these
kinds
of
collateral
attacks,
are
the
availability
of
contempt
proceedings,
and
the
district
court
and
fifth
circuit
that
receives
the
challenge,
they
were
fully
aware
of
the
bankruptcy
court's
stay
order
at
the
time
that
this
issue
was
litigated,
the
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
both.
we
didn't
hide
it.
we
said,
the
bankruptcy
court
has
attempted
to
stay
execution
but
we
don't
believe
that
it
has
jurisdiction
to
do
this,
and
that
was
litigated,
and
both
the
district
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
said,
you
are
entitled
to
proceed
on
the
supersedeas
bond.
to
do
otherwise
would
undermine
the
very
purpose
of
the
transaction.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
and
my
answer
to
that
would
be
no,
and
again,
i'm
sure
that
if
we
thought
that
it
was
a
close
question,
we
wouldn't
have
pursued
this
challenge,
but
i
don't
believe
it
is
a
close
question.
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
risk
of
the
eleventh
circuit
finding
jurisdiction
of
any
kind
in
the
bankruptcy
court
to
stay
these
kinds
of
unrelated
proceedings.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
i
think
that
claim
could
be
made.
i
think
that--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--no.
i
have
not,
as,
again,
our
position
is
we're
unrelated
to
that
issue,
that--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--yes.
i
think
that
at
the
time
of...
i
actually
don't
think
that
celotex
has
a
right
to
the
collateral.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
yes.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
yes,
i
do.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
northbrook...
that's
true.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
northbrook...
northbrook
issued
the
bond.
they
assumed
that
obligation
to
us.
they
took
the
risk,
and--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--we
have
not,
your
honor.
we
have
not
received
the
funds
on
that.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
yes.
we're
entitled
to.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
yes,
it
is
a
voluntary
understanding
on
our
part.
celotex
has
agreed
to
not
pursue
contempt
proceedings
against
us--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--if
we
don't
collect,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
no,
i
don't,
your
honor.
that
language,
i
think,
to
give
my
own
interpretation
to
it,
it
is,
we're
not
reversing
an
order
of
a
court
in
another
circuit
over
which
we
don't
have
jurisdiction,
we're
just
affirming
a
decision
below,
because
i
think
that
language
is
in
response
to
statements
made
in
the
petition
for
rehearing
that
you're
effectively
reversing
an
order
in
another
circuit,
and
i
think
that
was
to
respond
to
that.
but
i
do
think
that
the
bankruptcy
court's
order,
to
the
extent
that
it
assumed
that
there
was
jurisdiction
to
do
this,
was
necessarily
wrong.
if
the
bankruptcy
court
was
right
in
assuming
jurisdiction
over
the
bond,
then
i
don't
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
could
have
ruled
the
way
it
did.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
yes,
and
i
don't
think
that
language
really
adds
to
the
analysis--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--yes,
that's
correct,
and
i
think
that
again
the
fifth
circuit
was
well
aware
of
the
effect
of
its
order,
effect
of
the
bankruptcy...
aware
that
its
order
did
conflict
with
the
bankruptcy
court's
order,
and
was
delicate
in
its
language
saying,
no,
you
don't
have
the
power
to
do
this.
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that,
to
the
extent
that
the
order
could
be
connected
in
any
way
with
the
adversary
proceedings,
to
the
extent
that
celotex
has
a...
or
claims
an
interest
in
the
property
because
of
the
adversary
proceeding,
we've
said
in
our
brief
that
we
think
that
would
be
patently
frivolous.
i
would
reiterate
that,
and
add
that
the
bankruptcy...
to
the
extent
that
the
order
staying
enforcement
on
bonds
generally
is
an
injunctive
order,
it
did
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
rule
65,
there's
no
showing
of
a
likelihood
of
success
in
the
avoidance
action
and
celotex
did
not
even
attempt
to
show
a
likelihood
of
success.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
i
think
that
the
person
could
challenge
it
if
it
makes
no
pretense
to
obey
rule
65,
and
this
does
not.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
it...
the...
no,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that
if
an
order
that...
that...
i
think
there
are
two
different
concepts.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
i
think
that
no,
an
order
under
rule
65,
that's
not
properly
entered
under
rule
65,
doesn't
defeat
the
court's
own
jurisdiction,
but
to
the...
but
that
it
does
make
the
order
unenforceable
for
another
reason,
and
that
is
that
it's
patently
frivolous
with
no
pretense
to
validity,
another
exception
to
the
collateral
attack.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
no.
that...
it's
a
different
issue
than
the
jurisdictional
issue.
it's
a
different
defect
with
the
order,
and
that's
all
i'm
saying.
there
are
two
defects
with
the
order.
to
the
extent
that
it's
issued
under
the
bankruptcy
court's
general
jurisdiction
to
supervise
a
bankruptcy,
and
deal
with
product
problems
related
to
however
tangential
the
bankrupt's
estate,
there's
no
jurisdiction
to
do
that.
to
the
extent
that
it's
related,
or
attempted
to
be
related,
and
i'm
not
even
sure
if
it's
argued
to
be
related
specifically
to
the
adversary
proceeding,
then
it
is...
to
not
comply
with
the
injunction
rule
is
patently
frivolous
and
has
no
pretense
to
validity.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
yes,
that's
true,
with
the
exceptions
listed...
that
is,
lack
of
jurisdiction,
or
no
conceivable...
patently
frivolous
with
no
pretense
to
validity.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
yes.
they
are
distinct
bases
for
attacking
orders
of
any
kind,
injunctive
or
otherwise.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
but
it
is
a
doctrine
of
this
court.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
walker
v.
city
of
birmingham
recognizes
that
as
an
exception
to
the
effective
injunctive
orders.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
yes.
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical,
i
think,
yes.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
perhaps
i
didn't
understand
your
earlier
hypothetical
as
well
as
i
should
have.
the...
if
you
were
asking,
does
northbrook
have
a
right
to
retain
the
collateral,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
clearly
yes,
celotex
has
lost
its
property
interest
in
that.
if
your
question
is,
does
the
retention
of
the
collateral
that
celotex

affect
celotex's
estate,
i
think
yes,
this
is
property
that--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--yes.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
that...
that
is
true.
that
certainly
isn't
the
situation
here,
and
that's
why
i
think--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--oh,
i'm
sorry,
yes.
that
is...
they
are
attacking
that.
that
attack
has
no
validity
whatsoever.
this
bond
was
posted
well
in
excess
of
the
fraudulent...
i
mean,
i'm
sorry,
the
preference
period,
well
in
excess
of
the
statutory
period
for
avoiding
constructively
fraudulent
transfers
under
section
548,
and
was
done
for
purposes
of
satisfying
or
securing
an
antecedent
debt
which
is
expressly
said
to
be
not
a
fraudulent
transfer.
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
i...
as
i
understood
your
question,
it
was,
does
the
retention
of
collateral
affect
celotex,
because
we
were
dealing
with
the
broad
jurisdictional
question
under
1334(b),
and
i
said
yes,
i
think
the
retention
of
collateral
affects
celotex
certainly
more
directly
than
our
claim
against
northbrook,
but
no,
i
do
not
think
the
transfer
could
colorably
be
attacked.
i
think
it
defies--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--my
understanding
of
northbrook's
position
is
they've
opposed
the...
they've
defended
the
avoidance
action
in
florida
and
in
fact
characterized
the
bankruptcy
court's
injunction
or
stay
order
in
this
case
as
novel,
which
i
think
is
strong
language
from
an
insurance--
mr.
brent
m.
rosenthal
--yes,
but
i
would,
your
honor.
i
say
that
there
is
no
colorable
basis.
to
say
that
a
party
a
year
before,
or
more
than
a
year
before
a
bankruptcy,
that
pays
a
debt,
pays
a
judgment,
or
secures
a
judgment
through
a
supersedeas
bond,
has
committed
or
performed
a
fraudulent
transfer,
is
an
alice-in-wonderland
concept,
and
i
submit
that
it's
absolutely
not
colorable.
thank
you,
your
honor.
