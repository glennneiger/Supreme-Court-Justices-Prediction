justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
would
that
bar
another
circuit
from
reexamining
this
order
if
there
were...
because
there's
colorable
jurisdiction
to
issue
it?
suppose
the
assertion
was
that
there
was
a
patent
jurisdictional
defect.
i
don't
think
that
assertion
is
made
here,
but
suppose
it
were,
would
that
bar
the
fifth
circuit
from
making
this
inquiry?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
is
your
position
here
that
there
is
no
patent
defect,
that
there
is
at
least
colorable
jurisdiction,
and
that
that's
the
end
of
the
matter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
have
to
make
a
detailed
inquiry,
or
the
fifth
circuit
is
entitled
to
make
a
detailed
inquiry,
into
the
jurisdiction
under
1334?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
that
position
of
yours
turn
in
any
respect
on
the
fact
that
northbrook
was
itself
bound
by
the
order
of
the
bankruptcy
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
northbrook
had
not
been
caught
in
the
middle,
would
your
position
be
different?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
is
to
say,
suppose
northbrook
had
not
been
bound
by
the
order
because
there
was
no
personal
jurisdiction
over
it,
or
it
had
no
knowledge
of
the
order.
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out
whether
or
not
northbrook's
position
before
the
bankruptcy
court
is
the
linchpin
of
your
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
is
bound--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
its
view,
by
the
order
that
the
bankruptcy
court
issued.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
takes
the
position,
and
you
take
the
position
on
its
behalf,
that
if
that
order
is
to
be
revised
or
amended
or
suspended
as
to
northbrook,
it
has
to
be
the
issuing
court
that
does
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
it
have
no
jurisdiction
to
do
that
as
to
northbrook?
