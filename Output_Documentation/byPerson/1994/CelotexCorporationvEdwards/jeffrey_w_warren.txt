mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
bankruptcy
court
presiding
over
the
celotex
chapter
11
case
had
jurisdiction
to
enter
an
interim
stay
of
execution
on
supersedeas
bonds
by
judgment
creditors
of
celotex.
that
stay
restrained
the
edwardses
from
collecting
their
judgment
against
celotex,
which
was
largely
for
punitive
damages
from
northbrook,
the
surety
on
the
supersedeas
bond
posted
for
the
benefit
of
celotex,
for
the
benefit
of
the
edwardses.
the
case
arises
out
of
the
edwards'
admitted
collateral
attack
on
the
bankruptcy
court
stay
order
when
they
requested
under
rule
65.1
that
the
district
court
in
texas
which
had
originally
presided
over
their
personal
injury
claim
against
celotex
granted
them
permission
to
enforce
the
supersedeas
bond
against
northbrook
notwithstanding
the
bankruptcy
court's
stay
order.
at
the
time
celotex
filed
its
bankruptcy
petition
it
had
posted
similar
supersedeas
bonds
in
over
100
separate
appeals
using
70
million
dollars
of
assets
to
secure
its
obligations
to
the
sureties.
celotex
was
defending
over
100,000
personal
injury
and
wrongful
death
cases,
all
of
which
were
the
result
of
the
same
conduct
by
a
predecessor
that
had
merged
into
celotex,
which
was
the
same
basis
for
the
claims
of
the
edwardses.
these
cases
arise
from
exposure
to
asbestos-containing
products.
they
were
manufactured
by
philip
carey
corporation,
a
corporation
that
was
merged
into
celotex
in
the
early
1970's.
over
the
objections
of
celotex
and
northbrook,
the
texas
district
court
granted
the
edwards'
request
for
permission
to
ignore
the
bankruptcy
court's
stay
order.
the
fifth
circuit
affirmed.
a
similar
attempted
collateral
attack
by
the
same
plaintiffs'
counsel
was
rejected
by
the
fourth
circuit
when
it
reversed
a
virginia
district
court
order
that
had
granted
permission
to
ignore
the
bankruptcy
court's
stay
order.
the
fourth
circuit
directed
that
the
judgment
creditor
had
to
seek
direct
from
the
bankruptcy
court.
in
response
to
the
improper
collateral
attack
arguments
raised
by
celotex,
the
edwardses
concede
that
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
must
be
reversed
if
the
bankruptcy
court
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
to
issue
its
interim
stay
of
the
execution
upon
celotex'
supersedeas
bonds.
that's
the
issue
in
this
case.
the
statutory
basis
of
the
bankruptcy
court's
subject
matter
jurisdiction
is
28
u.s.c.
section
1334(b),
which
states
that
the
district
courts
have
jurisdiction
of
all
civil
proceedings
arising
under
title
11
or
arising
in
or
related
to
cases
under
title
11.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
justice
o'connor,
the
way
it
affects
the
estate
is
that
celotex
has
a
contractual
relationship
with
northbrook
that
was
entered
into
as
part
of
the
posting
of
the
supersedeas
bond.
to
secure
that
contractual
relationship,
celotex,
under
a
settlement
agreement
that
resolved
certain
insurance
coverage
disputes
with
northbrook,
pledged
that
if
northbrook
had
to
pay
a
bond
it
could
exercise
rights
of
set-off
against
the
funds
that
would
otherwise
be
available
to
celotex
for
payment
to
its
creditors,
so
that
although
under
the--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
money
that
northbrook
would
pay
to
the
edwardses
is
not
subject
to
the
property
of
the
estate.
the
property
pledged
by
celotex
to
northbrook
is
property
of
the
estate,
and
it's
that
interconnection
that
creates
the
effect.
this--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--that
is
absolutely
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
yes,
your
honor.
there
are
two
bases
upon
which
celotex
for
the
benefit
of
its
estate
is
presently
prosecuting
adversary
proceedings
in
the
bankruptcy
court
to
bring
back
into,
to
recover
for
the
benefit
of
all
of
its
creditors,
those
funds.
the
first
premise
is,
is
that
the
vast
majority
of
the
edwards'
claim
is
for
punitive
damages.
245,000
dollars
of
their
claim
is
for
punitive
damages.
under
the
principles
of
equitable
subordination
codified
in
section
510(c)
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
celotex
is
seeking,
through
the
bankruptcy
court,
to
subordinate
those
claims,
which
would
then
invalidate
and
bring
back
to
the
estate
those
funds
that
were
transferred
to
northbrook.
the
second
attack
that's
been
made--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--that's
correct,
but
it
is
a
judgment
for
punitive
awards
which
under
normal
bankruptcy
practice
would
not
be
recoverable
in
lieu
of
the
ability
to
compensate
regular
compensatory
awards.
the
invalidity
of
the
claim...
the
obligation
of
northbrook
on
the
judgment
to
the
edwardses
is
predicated
upon
the
affirmance
by
the
fifth
circuit
of
that
judgment.
the
bankruptcy
code
expressly
permits
a
basis
upon
which
equitable
subordination
can
occur,
so
that
one
creditor
cannot
recover
for
its
benefit
claims
to
the
detriment
of
other
creditors
if
the
bankruptcy
court
finds
appropriate
grounds
for
that
to
occur.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
the
transfer
by
celotex
to
northbrook
was
for
the
indirect
benefit
of
the
edwardses.
northbrook
would
not
stand
as
a
surety
for
celotex
but
for
the
existence
of
adequate
collateral.
the
bankruptcy
code
contemplates
that
transfers
both
direct
and
indirect
can
be
avoided,
and
so--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--within
the
group
of
bonds
there
are
preferences,
there
are
fraudulent
transfers.
the
area
of
fraudulent
transfers
is
what
is
applicable
in
connection
with
the
edwards'
claim
because
it
is
outside
the
90-day
preference
period.
you
know,
celotex
maintains
that
the
transfer
for
the
indirect
benefit
of
the
edwardses
to
northbrook
constituted
a
fraudulent
conveyance,
constructively
fraudulent.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--that
is
the
issue,
because
the...
in
order
to
avoid
the
transfer,
celotex
must
establish
insolvency
at
the
time
of
the
transfer,
or
insolvency
as
a
result
of
the
transfer,
and
a
lack
of
reasonably
equivalent
value
in
exchange
for
the
transfer.
celotex'
financial
condition,
as
is
evidenced
by
the
record
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
which
is
not
before
and
never
was
brought
to
the
record
that's
before
this
court
coming
from
the
fifth
circuit,
demonstrates
that
the
financial
condition
of
celotex
at
the
time
of
these
transfers
of
its
assets
to
the
surety
was
the
same
as
at
the
time
of
the
filing
of
its
bankruptcy
petition,
so
what
the
bankruptcy
court
has
done
in
this
case
is,
it
has
continued
a
stay
and
maintained
the
status
quo
using
its
powers
under
section
105--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--well,
that
would
be
the
defense
that
is
being
raised
to
the
fraudulent
conveyance
claim.
however,
constructively
fraudulent
conveyances
where
there's
a
lack
of
reasonably
equivalent
value
under
the
bankruptcy
code
can
be
called
back.
and
celotex
did
not
benefit.
remember,
your
honor,
celotex
will
never
receive
any
of
these
funds.
it
will
only...
this
is
a
question
of
allocating
limited
resources
among
a
few
judgment
creditors
who
had
the
benefit
of
supersedeas
bonds,
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
other
judgment
creditors
whose
claims
arise
from
the
exact
same
conduct.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
yes,
during...
absent
the
posting
of
the
supersedeas
bond.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
and
your
honor,
the
issue
that
is
being
litigated
now
is
whether
the
forbearance
that
is
affected
by
the
supersedeas
bond
is
sufficient
consideration
to
meet
the
reasonably
equivalent
consideration
test
in
order
to...
in
order
to
avoid
a
constructively
fraudulent
transfer.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
your
honor,
that's
absolutely
correct.
i'm
merely
responding
to
the
inquiries
from
the
court.
i
have
a
zeal
for
the
merits
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
but
whether
the
bankruptcy
court
was
right
or
wrong,
the
fifth
circuit
should
have
recognized
that...
that
injunction.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
do
not
think
that
it
is
appropriate
at
this
time
for
this
court
to
deal
with
the
merits,
but
only
whether
or
not
there
was
a
relationship,
a
related
two-jurisdiction
issue.
did
the
bankruptcy
court
have
some
connection?
is
there
a
nexus
between
what's
occurring
with
these
supersedeas
bonds
and
the
estate--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
actual
stay
called
for
the
parties
to
come
first
to
the
bankruptcy
court
to
seek
modification.
if
it
was
denied
they
would
have
appellate
rights
to
the
eleventh
circuit.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
well,
in
the
mass
tort
context
with
100,000
the
stay
order
doesn't
name
anybody
specifically.
you
know,
that's
the
problem
that
you
have
logistically,
practically
with
that
type
of
proceeding.
the
bankruptcy
court
was
confronted
at
the
early
stages
of
the
celotex
reorganization
with,
you
know,
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
appeals,
not
only
these
types
of
appeals,
but
celotex
was
involved
in
insurance
coverage
disputes
that
were
rather
complex
throughout
the
country,
adr
proceedings,
all
types
of
administrative
and
judicial
proceedings,
so
that
the
court
entered
this
broad
stay
as
a
case
management
mechanism.
subsequently,
the
court
has
specified
the
applicability
of
the
stay
and
has
considered
efforts
to
modify
the
stay
on
behalf
of
all
of
the
bonded
claimants.
counsel
for
the
edwardses
came
to
the
court
shortly
after
the
bankruptcy
case
was
filed
seeking
to
have
the
state
modify
it,
and
at
that
time
the
court
clarified,
you
know,
that...
its
determination
with
respect
to
the
status
of
the
supersedeas
bond
and
that
it
applied
even
when
the
appeal
had
been
resolved
without
effect.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
yes,
your
honor.
we
maintain
that
congress
under
the
bankruptcy
clause
empowered
the
district
court
in
the
middle
district
of
florida
having
jurisdiction
over
the
bankruptcy
case
filed
by
the
celotex
corporation
to
consider
all
matters
that
are
related
to
that
case.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
no,
your
honor.
we
would
agree
that
if
there
was
a
patent
jurisdictional
defect,
then
the
collateral
attack
rule
would
have
an
exception
that
would
permit
the
fifth
circuit
to...
or
the
district
court
in
texas
to
consider
the
matter.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
that's
correct,
your
honor,
although
i
think
that
it
has...
i
think
it's
appropriate
that
the
court
that
issued...
i
think
it's
good
public
policy
that
the
court
that
issues
an
injunction,
that
has
colorable
jurisdiction
to
enter
that
injunction,
should...
you
know,
a
party
should
respect
and
obey
that
injunction.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
that
either
the
bankruptcy
court
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
or
the
bankruptcy
court
did
not
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
no,
your
honor,
we
rely
on
1334(b)
for
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
your
honor,
i
think
that
they
were
entitled
to
look
at
the
jurisdiction
that
was
asserted
by
the
bankruptcy
court,
and
finding
that
jurisdiction
exists
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
then
they
should
have
deferred
to
the
stay
that
was
entered
by
that
court
unless
and
until
it
was
modified
on
direct
appeal.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
your
honor,
it's
more
than
just
property--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--yes,
your
honor.
the
circuit
court
test
with
respect
to
related-to
jurisdiction,
which
is
a
broad
definition,
and
congress
intended
it
to
be
broadly
construed
as
part
of
the
uniformity
associated
with
bankruptcy
matters,
intended
that
the
bankruptcy
court,
or
the
district
court
exercising
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
have
broad
jurisdiction.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--absolutely,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--well,
the
facts
are
that
the
transfers
made
by
the
celotex
corporation
were
made
at
a
time
when
it
was
insolvent.
the
facts
are
that
the...
at
the
time
of
these
events,
there
was
no
consideration
that
was
increased
to
the
celotex
estate.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
once...
well--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--absolutely,
your
honor,
because
it
protects
the
reorganization
process,
and
that
is
precisely
why
the
collateral
attack
by
the
fifth
circuit
should
not
be
condoned.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
well,
your
honor,
in
order
for
the...
in
order
for
the
respondents
after
the
bankruptcy
was
in
place
to
have
executed
against
northbrook,
they
would
have
had
to
have
asserted
some
procedure
to
comply
with
due
process,
and
rule
65.1
provides
that
expedited
summary-type
procedure,
and
what
the
edwardses
sought
here
was
permission
from
the
district
court
to
pursue
their
remedies
against
northbrook,
and
of
course
that--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--had
there
been
no
supersedeas
bond,
then
the
bankruptcy
would
have
implemented
a
stay
that
would
have
precluded
the
edwardses
as
all
other
creditors--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
that's
correct,
your
honor.
one
of
the
issues
in
this
case
is
the
purpose
of
a
supersedeas
bond.
is
it
to
enhance
the
entitlement
of
the
judgment
creditor,
or
is
it
merely
to
preserve
the
judgment
creditor's
standpoint
during
the
pendency
of
an
appeal
if
that
appeal
is
without
effect?
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
yes,
your
honor,
whether
it
could
have
any
conceivable--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
there's
almost
uniform
following
of
that
particular
test,
and
you
know,
some
circuits
have
adopted
slightly
different
language,
but
all
of
them
have
recognized
that
if
there
could
be
any
conceivable
effect
on
the
property
of
the
debtor's
estate
or
on
the
allocation
of
property
among
creditors,
then
there
is
related-to
jurisdiction.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
that
would
be
one.
the
other
would
be
if
we
can
equitably
subordinate
the
punitive
award
that
the
edwardses
have
recovered,
because
the
edwardses
are
seeking
to
have
collected
a
punitive
award
against
celotex,
while
other
creditors
similarly
situated
will
not
be
in
a
position
to
recover
in
full
any
of
their
compensatory
claims,
and
so
those
are
issues
that
the
bankruptcy
court
as
part
of
its
power
to
adjust
debtor-creditor
relationships--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--well,
there
is
a
limit
to
the
avoiding
powers
that
a
debtor
in
possession
will
be
able
to
exercise.
however,
there
are
remedies
up
until
such
time
as
the
statute
of
limitations
has
expired.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
from
a
fraudulent
transfer
standpoint,
no,
your
honor,
because
there
would
be
a
satisfaction
of
the
judgment
that
would
have
occurred
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
petition.
from
a
preference
standpoint,
yes.
the
avoidance
powers
would
enable
a
recovery
with
respect
to
a
preferential
transfer
that
was
made
within
the
90-day
period
before
bankruptcy.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
as
a
preference,
yes,
your
honor,
because
within
the
90-day
period,
if
the
debtor
is
insolvent,
if
the
payment
effects
a
benefit
to
the
judgment
creditor
on
behalf
of
an
antecedent
debt,
meaning
that
it
has
to
be
not
a
contemporaneous
exchange
of
value,
but
for
an
antecedent
debt,
then
the
bankruptcy
code
does
provide
the
remedy
for
purposes
of
bringing
and
recovering--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--i
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
if
there
is
a
reversionary
interest--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--could
have
a
conceivable
effect.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that...
you
know,
i
think
that
the
third
circuit
in
pacor
is
a
good
example
of
a
situation
where
the
court
defined
conceivable
effect,
but
determined
that
there
would
be
no
enhancement
of
the
estate,
there
was
no
harm
to
the
estate,
and
therefore
determined
that
the
matter
was
not
related
to
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
even
if
you
disagree
with
the
merits
of
the
remedies,
or
the
available
remedies,
you
know,
courts
should
respect
stays
and
injunctions
entered
by
other
courts.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
unless
it's
patently
frivolous,
unless
there's
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
or
unless
there's
no
personal
jurisdiction,
which
are
not
issues
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
that
is
the
issue,
because
forbearance
is
not
quantifiable,
and
the
evidence
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
again
not
in
the
record
before
the
fifth
circuit,
is
that
the
financial
condition
of
celotex
was
the
same
on
the
petition
date
as
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
transfer
for
the
indirect
benefit
of
the
edwardses.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
that
is
correct,
and
the
fourth
circuit
recognized
this,
so
it
would
be
hard
to
say
that
it
was
completely
frivolous
when
the
fourth
circuit
in
willis
recognized
the
exact
same
celotex,
the
exact
same
factual
circumstance--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--yes,
your
honor.
northbrook's
caught
in
the
middle,
because
they're
bound
by--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--your
honor,
i
don't...
i
have
a
hard
time--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--thinking
how
they
would
not
be.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
yes,
your
honor.
northbrook
is
like
stakeholders.
northbrook
is
happy
to
compensate
the
edwardses.
northbrook
is
happy
to
give
the
funds
back
to
the--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--to
the
debtors.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
precisely
why
this
court
should
reverse
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--no,
your
honor,
they're
still
in
litigation
now.
there
are
229
parties
to
that
litigation,
and
the
bankruptcy
court
has
under
advisement
summary
judgments.
the
court
just
recently
accepted
new
briefing
based
upon
this
court's
decision
in
bfp
with
respect
to
the
fraudulent
transfer
issues.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
as
this
court
has
recognized,
bankruptcies
do
strange
things.
this
case
does
not
present
an
alice
in
wonderland.
it
is
involving
a
substantial
amount
of
money,
a
substantial
amount
of
issues.
what
the
bankruptcy
court
has
done
has
preserved
the
status
quo.
the
heart
of
our
appeal,
and
the
reason
why
the
fifth
circuit's
decision
should
be
reversed,
is
it
impairs
the
orderly
judicial
administration.
justice
stevens--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--well,
your
honor,
it
maintains
the
status
quo
in
the
sense
that
the
funds
are
still
available,
the
obligation
of
northbrook
as
a
surety
is
still
available,
the
right
and
entitlements
and
the
avoidance
powers
as
they
exist
are
still
available
with
respect
to
the
estate,
and
the
passage
of
time
that
has
occurred,
the
bankruptcy
court
has
provided
adequate
protection
to
ensure
that
segregated
funds
exist
for
the
benefit
of
any
impairment
that
occurs
as
a
result
of
the
delays.
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
and
the
collateral
has
not
gone,
because
the
bankruptcy
court
has
ordered
the
sureties
to
deposit
those
funds,
so
consequently,
we
have
issues--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
there's
two
colorable
bases
that
are
being
litigated
now
that
exist,
the
constructively
fraudulent
transfer,
which
is
a
4-year
statute
of
limitations
under
florida
law,
which
has
been
established
as
being
the
law
controlling
this
transfer,
so
it's
within
the
statute
of
limitations,
no
question
that
celotex
was
insolvent
at
the
time
it
transferred
the
assets
to
northbrook,
there's
no
question
that
the
transfer
was
for
the
indirect
benefit
of
the
edwardses,
no
question
about
that,
the
only
issue
is
whether
or
not
there
was
a
reasonably
equivalent
exchange
of
value,
meaning
that
the
forbearance--
mr.
jeffrey
w.
warren
--thank
you,
your
honor.
