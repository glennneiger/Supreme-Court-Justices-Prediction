justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
warren,
could
you
help
me
just
with
this
one
very
preliminary
question?
it
seems
to
me
you're
arguing
the
merits
of
the
bankruptcy
court's
injunction,
and
i
thought
your
basic
position
was
that
even
if
the
injunction
was
erroneously
entered,
you
should
still
prevail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
the
thrust
of
your
argument
is
we
shouldn't
be
deciding
that,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
warren,
i
don't
understand
why
that
claim
would
be
affected
one
way
or
another
by
whether
the
bonding
company
pays
out
on
the
bond.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
rather
elementary
question?
i
must
confess
my
ignorance
about
some
of
this.
your
clients
are
not
parties
to
the
injunction,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
arguable
that
they're
in
contempt
of
court
in
tampa?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
any
contempt
proceedings
been
brought
against
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
contempt
proceedings
against
the
bonding
company?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
procedure,
proceeding
there
which
is
testing
the
validity
of
the
injunction
as
applied
to
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
any.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
again,
you
would
agree
that
if
the
injunction
is
ultimately
upheld...
say
if
the
fifth
circuit
decision
stands,
too,
don't
you
run
some
risk
of
being
held
in
contempt
of
court
ultimately
and
punished
for
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you're
willing
to
take
that
risk,
in
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
then
northbrook
would
be
under
conflicting
obligations--
--no,
because
they
can--
--if
the
fifth
circuit
standpoint--
--they
can
pay
the
judgment
without...
and
lose
on
both
cause.
