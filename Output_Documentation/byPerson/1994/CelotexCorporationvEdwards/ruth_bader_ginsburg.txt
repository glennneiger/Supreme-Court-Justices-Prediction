justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
warren,
didn't
you
say
what
was
infected
was
the
collateral,
not
the
judgment
itself?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
would
be
the
basis
for
setting
aside
the
transfer
from
celotex
to
northbrook
to
secure
the
appeal
bonds?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
attacking
those
as
preferences,
or
fraudulent,
or...
what's
the
basis
for
attacking
that
transfer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
comes
down
to
which
is
the
proper
circuit,
ultimately,
to
resolve
this
legal
question
of
whether
the
appeal
bond
can
be
thrown
back
for
the
benefit
of
all
the
creditors.
it's
just
that...
it's
a
question
of
whether
it's
the
eleventh
circuit
or
the
fifth
circuit
that's
going
to
make
that
ruling.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
warren,
at
this
point,
mustn't
we
decide
more
than
colorable,
because
at
least
in
the
forum
where
the
appeal
bond
was
lodged,
that's
a
mechanical
procedure,
ordinarily.
you
called
it...
you
said
everyone
agreed
that
in
the
fifth
circuit
there
was
a
collateral
attack
on
the
bankruptcy
court's
stay
order,
but
in
fact
what
there
was
was
a
motion
under
the
federal
rules
to
realize
the
judgment
against
the
appeal
bond.
it
wasn't
a
separate
proceeding
collaterally
attacking
the
stay
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
so
it's
not
like
a
little
jurisdiction.
the
question
is,
does
the
bankruptcy
court
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
it
either
does
or
it
doesn't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you're
relying
on
105
for
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
bond
was
put
up--
--and
the
bond--
--before
there
was
any
bankruptcies.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
warren,
if
the
automatic
stay
in
bankruptcy
didn't
occur
until
after
that
judgment
was
rendered,
and
is
there
any
precedent
for
saying
when
somebody
has
a
good
judgment,
and
the
judgment
is
paid
before
the
bankruptcy
petition
is
filed,
but
yet
the
bankruptcy
estate
can
go
back
and
get
that
court
judgment,
can
set
aside
that
court
judgment?
i
don't
know--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
do
have
one
question
about
the
status
of
what
you
call
the
avoidance
action,
where
there
were
motions
for
summary
judgment
pending
as
of
last
march.
have
those
been
disposed
of?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--isn't
it
a
little
abstract
to
say
these
claims
are
not
related
to
the
bankruptcy?
isn't
it
in
fact
the
case
that
these
personal
injury
claims
are
what
drove
celotex
and
companies
similarly
situated
into
bankruptcy,
so
it's
quite...
i
can
understand
the
abstract
categorization
that
you're
making,
and
is
it
not
possible
that
if
celotex
didn't
think
it
had
a
shot
at
defeating
the
punitive
recoveries,
it
might
have
gone
into
bankruptcy
earlier
when
faced
with
these
hundreds
of
claims?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
not...
you
don't
take
a
merits...
i
guess
what
i'm
hearing
from
you
is
a
kind
of
a
merits
first
approach
to
jurisdiction.
if
you
lose
on
the
merits,
there's
no
jurisdiction,
but
the
words,
related
to,
in
a
jurisdictional
statute,
have
generally
been
given
a
very
broad
meaning.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosenthal,
what
would
have
happened
if,
after
the
district
court
judgment,
an
appeal
bond
is
put
up,
and
while
the
appeal
is
pending,
the
chapter
11
had
been
filed,
what
would
have
been
the
situation
of
the
edwardses
then?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
rosenthal,
isn't
that
unseemly
in
the
federal
system
this
should
go...
be
settled
in
one
place
or
another
and
then
to
have
the
risk
of
contempt
because
the
edwardses
are
resisting
the
authority
of
the
courts
within
the
eleventh
circuit,
to
say
that
what
has
happened
in
fifth
circuit
is
okay
but
that
can
be
checked
later
on
through
contempt
proceedings...
for
the
smooth
functioning
of
a
federal
system,
shouldn't
it
be
clear
that
either
you're
right
or
mr.
warren
is
right
about
the
authority
of
the
courts
within
the
eleventh
circuit?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
agree
that
if
the
fifth
circuit
was
wrong
about
the
jurisdiction
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
however
wrong
the
bankruptcy
court
may
have
been
on
the
merits
of
granting
the
stay,
if
they
were
wrong
about
the
jurisdiction,
the
authority
of
the
bankruptcy
court
to
issue
its
stay,
that
would
include
all
the
personal
injury
people
who
already
had
judgments,
then
this
gets
sorted
out
in
the
eleventh
circuit
and
not
in
the
fifth
circuit?
the
question
is,
was
there
authority
in
the
bankruptcy
court
in
florida,
in
the
district
court
in
florida.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
can
pay...
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
the
edwardses
have
realized
on
the
appeal
bond,
that
you've
gotten
paid,
or
you
haven't?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
under
the
fifth
circuit
judgment
you
could.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you...
what...
why
are
you
not...
this
is
some
voluntary
understanding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
don't
collect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
is
the
answer
clearly
yes?
it's
a
transfer.
the
collateral
was
transferred
within
the
preference
period,
or
it
could
be
attacked
as
fraudulent
of
other
creditors.
i
don't
understand
why
that's
so
clear.
the
transfer
of
the
collateral,
which
i
take
it
was...
these
are
claims
that
celotex
had
against
its
own
insurer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
what
the
collateral
was,
and
if
the
transfer
occurred
within
the
preference
period
or
could
otherwise
be...
could
be
characterized
as
fraudulent,
then
why
isn't
that
a
valid
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
mr.
warren
said
that's
exactly
what
the
situation
was,
that
they
were
attacking
the
transfer
from
celotex
to
the
insurer
as
either
preferential
or
fraudulent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
northbrook
agree
with
you?
this
is
a
stakeholder
that
says,
i
don't
care
who
gets
paid,
i
don't
want
to
have
to
pay
twice.
so
we're
hearing
from
you
to
say
that
they
don't
have
any
problem,
northbrook--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
quite
different
from
saying
they
haven't
got
a
colorable
basis
for
the
claim,
that
there
is
no...
in
the
bankruptcy
court
there's
no
colorable
basis
to
set
aside
the
transfer
to
the
insurer.
