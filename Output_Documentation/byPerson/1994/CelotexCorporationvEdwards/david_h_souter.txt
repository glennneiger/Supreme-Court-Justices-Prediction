justice
david
h.
souter
on
that
point,
i
want
to
ask,
was
northbrook
subject
to
the
stay
order?
did
the
stay
order
run
against
northbrook--
justice
david
h.
souter
--specifically?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't...
i
guess
i
have
the
same
question.
isn't
your
claim
broader
than
that?
even
if
there
were
no
attack
on
these
bonds,
isn't
it
your
position
that
the
bankruptcy
court
would
still
have
jurisdiction
to
enter
an
injunction
against
realizing
on
the
bond?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
the
only--
--but
how--
--i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
no,
i
was
going
to
say,
the
only
jurisdictionally
relevant
fact
that
you
have
to
establish
is
that,
if
in
fact
the
edwardses
realized
on
the
bond,
there
would
be
a
consequence
to
the
bankruptcy
estate,
i.e.,
the
bonding
company
would
then
presumably
realize
on
its
collateral.
that's
all
you
have
to
show,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you're
saying
that
that
determination,
or
the
determination
of
your
position,
simply
cannot
be
made
without
a
full
trial
on
the
merits,
and
therefore
there's
no
opportunity
to
come
under
the
frivolousness
rule
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
deny,
mr.
rosenthal,
that
the
claim
that
your
opponent
has
made
that
if,
in
fact,
the
edwardses
realize
on
the
bond,
the
bonding
company
is
going
to
go
against
the
collateral,
the
collateral
is
going
to
affect
the
value
of
the
bankruptcy
estate.
do
you...
is
there
a
flaw
in
at
least
that
sequence
of
reasoning?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that's
not
the
argument.
i
mean,
that's
a
different
argument,
but
the
argument
that's
being
made
here
is
that
the
proceeding
against
the
bond,
if
allowed
to
run
its
course,
and
it's
successful,
as
presumably
it
would
be,
would
affect
the
value
of
the
bankruptcy
estate?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
do
you...
what's
the
misstep?
you
admit
the
bond
is
subject
to
collateral--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
the
collateral
is
in
the
bankruptcy
estate.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
what's
wrong
with
his
reasoning?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he
isn't
claiming
that
you
are
seeking
the
collateral.
all
he's
claiming
is
that
the
proceedings
against
the
collateral
will
affect
the
value
of
the
bankruptcy
estate,
and
he
is
saying
that
therefore
the...
in
effect
the
status
of
the
collateral
and
any
threat
to
it
is
a
matter
which
is
related
to
the
chapter
11
proceeding,
and
that's
all
that's
necessary
for
jurisdiction
under
1334(b).
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
this
is
more
than...
you're
quite
right
about
your
statement
of
the
test,
but
isn't
this
a
little
bit
stronger
than
merely
conceivable?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
go
against
the
collateral,
the
collateral
isn't
going
to
be
there,
and
they
have
priority.
the
collateral
isn't
going
to
be
there
in
the
general
bankruptcy
estate.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
presumably
northbrook
is
not
going
to
open
its
veins
and
bleed
to
death.
i
mean,
it's
reasonable
to
suppose
that
northbrook
is
going
to
want
to
realize
on
its
collateral,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
there's
nothing
frivolous
about
that
assumption,
is
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be
a
good
argument
in
front
of
the
court
that
decides
what
should
be
done,
as
to
whether
there
should
be
an
injunction
or
not,
but
i
don't
see
that
that
goes
to
jurisdiction.
the
question
on
jurisdiction
is,
is
it
related,
and
of
course
it's
related,
because
it's
going
to
affect
the
bankruptcy
estate.
at
least,
that's
his
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
a
good
argument
on
the
merits
of
whether
there
should
be
an
injunction,
but
i
don't
see
why
it
is
significant
with
respect
to
jurisdiction.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
collateral
has
not
gone.
