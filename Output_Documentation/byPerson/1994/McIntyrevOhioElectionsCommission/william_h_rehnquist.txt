chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-986,
joseph
mcintyre
v.
the
ohio
elections
commission.
mr.
goldberger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
saying
that
that's
why
the
leaflets
were
made
punishable,
because
they
urge
somebody
to
vote
a
particular
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because...
you
say
that's
the
only
place
where
the
ohio
statute
applies,
is
when
the
leaflets
are
addressed
to
voters?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
sort
of
a
town
is
westerville?
what
size?
is
it
by
itself,
or
is
it
a
suburb?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
typical
tv
ad
isn't
that
way.
i
mean,
there's
no
doubt
for
that
30
seconds
you're
watching
a
commercial
add
for
joe
doe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
just
said
on
the
television
screen,
vote
no
on
the
referendum
for
the
westerville
middle
school?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
constitutionality
of
such
a
prohibition
would
depend
on
some
minimum
to
be
selected
by
the
legislature?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
the
legislature
suggest
25...
choose
$25?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
the
arizona
statute,
do
you
have
to
disclose
the
names
of
major
donors
on
the
leaflet
itself?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
suggest
it
may
not
have
been
a
useful
step,
if
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it's
constitutional.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
some
of
our
cases
have
said
that
organizations
couldn't
be
required
to
disclose
the
names
of
their
members,
the
naacp,
for
example.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
can't
it
be
justified
on
the
possibility
of
fraud,
libel,
slander,
that
obtains
in
that
sort
of
thing,
and
that
the
identification
permits
that
sort
of
action
where
it's
warranted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
how
can
it
use
them
if
it
doesn't
know
who
published
the
statement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
prevaricate
isn't
the
only
thing.
how
about
someone
who
libels?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
said
the
school
superintendent
has
deliberately
misrepresented
the
need
for
this
budget
bill?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
can't
file
it
against
an
anonymous
leafleter
if
he
doesn't
know
who
wrote
the
leaflet.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
state
of
ohio
hasn't
chosen
a
disclosure--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
and
i'm
saying,
what's
wrong
with
it,
because
if
the
thing
is
libelous,
the
person
who
is
libeled
ought
to
know
who
it
was
so
that
he
can
have
some
recourse.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldberger.
mr.
sutter,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goldberger.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
93-986,
mcintyre
versus
ohio
elections
commission
will
be
announced
by
justice
stevens.
