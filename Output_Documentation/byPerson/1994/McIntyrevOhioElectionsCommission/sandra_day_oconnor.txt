justice

mr.
goldberger,
had
the
flier
of
ms.
mcintyre
related
to
a
congressional
election,
and
if
it
cost
more
than
$250
to
produce,
there
would
have
been
certain
federal
requirements,
would
there
not,
of
disclosing
the
expenditure
to
the
fec
and
her
identity
in
making
an
expenditure,
and
so
forth?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
do
you
take
the
position
that
that
kind
of
a
requirement
is
valid?
there's
no
first
amendment
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
wasn't
my
question.
i
don't
think
the
federal
statute
requires
the
disclosure
on
the
leaflet.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
it
requires
furnishing
information
to
the
fec
that
i
have
spent
x
amount
of
dollars
in
connection
with
a
political
campaign,
and
that
identity
is
then
a
matter
of
record.
i
suppose
the
public
can
learn
who
has
made
expenditures.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
doesn't
have
to
appear
on
the
leaflet.
now,
do
you
take
the
position
that
that
violates
the
first
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
a
requirement
on
a
television
ad
that
the
identity
of
the
people
running
the
ad
be
shown?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
goldberger--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
statute
441(d)
does
say
that
whenever
a
person
makes
an
expenditure
for
the
purpose
of
financing
communications
for
an
election,
such
communication
shall
clearly
state
the
name
of
the
person
making
it.
now,
if
that...
if
it
means
what
it
says,
and
if
we
have
upheld
that
statute
generally
in
buckley,
where
does
that
leave
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
interest
do
you
want
to
rely
on
here
to
support
the
state's
ban?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
there
other
statutes
in
ohio
that
deal
with
fraud
and
that
could
be
used
to
prosecute
someone
who
put
out
a
fraudulent
campaign
paper?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
i
guess
you'd
say
that
ohio
could
require,
had
we
been
back
in
those
days,
the
disclosure
of
the
writers
of
all
of
the
federalist
papers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
were
circulated
in
support
of
a
referendum
on
whether
the
constitution
should
be
adopted
or
ratified.
you
would
say
it
would
have
been
perfectly
okay
to
require
disclosure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
sutter,
i
would
have
thought
if
the
first
amendment
stood
for
anything
at
all,
it
stood
for
my
right
to
put
out
a
flier
at
a
local
school
board
election
on
an
issue
that
i
cared
about
without
identifying
myself.
i
mean,
it
just...
i
think
it's
quite
remarkable
to
say
that
ohio
can
just
totally
ban
this.
i
mean,
what
does
the
first
amendment
protect
if
not
that
kind
of
core
political
speech?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
what
kind
of
test
do
we
employ?
is
it
strict
scrutiny?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think
the
court
below
applied
strict
scrutiny?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
know,
in
this
context,
though,
it
almost
seems
that
on...
when
the
leaflet
speaks
to
the
merits
of
a
particular
issue,
as
this
does,
that
the
electorate
can
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
there
is
no
identification
of
the
speaker
attached
to
the
message
and
can
conclude,
if
it
wishes,
that
therefore
it
should
be
discounted.
i'm
not
sure
how
strong
the
state's
interest
is
in
forcing
the
information
on
the
electorate.
i
mean,
as
a
voter,
i
can
say,
well,
here's
an
anonymous
flier,
and
if
they
don't
care
enough
to
put
their
name
on
it,
i'm
going
to
toss
it
in
the
waste
basket.
i
don't
see
why
the
state's
interest
is
so
strong.
