justice
david
h.
souter
what
has
spectrum
scarcity
got
to
do
with
this
issue?
i
mean,
that's
the
basic
rationale
for
the
distinction.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
there
an
equal
potential
for
confusion
when
i
walk
up
to
the
polling
place
and
i'm
handed
6
or
8
or
10
or
12
leaflets
saying,
vote
for
this,
that,
or
the
other
person
or
issue
on
the
way
up
to
vote?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
just
did
not
see
my
puzzlement
last
september
when
i
was
on
my
way
into
the
primary.
[laughter]
let's
be
concrete
about
the
ohio
statute.
it
does
say
that
any
radio
or
television
ad
designed
to
influence
the
voters
in
an
election
must
identify
either
the
speaker
or
the
financial
sponsor.
is
that
constitutional
sometimes,
always,
never?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
never
made
a
claim,
i
take
it,
that
there
was
any
such
interest
as
was
recognized
in
naacp
in
alabama.
or
brown
v.
social
workers.
the
very
identity
of
the
person
would
leave
that
person
exposed
to
danger.
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
you
have
not
made
an
anonymity
claim.
i
mean,
you
told
us
that
your
client
did
not
make
any...
i
said
naacp...
any
brown
kind
of
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
your
answer,
as
i
understood,
your
answer
to
that
question
is
that
the
point
of
limit
comes
when
the
individual
can
assert
that
kind
of
a
brown
anonymity
claim,
and
you
don't
assert
it
in
this
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
that
in
this
case...
let's
take
this
case,
that
if
there
were
an
identification
requirement,
but
the
law
provided
in
any
case
in
which
an
individual
can
make
a
specialized
showing
of
danger
from
disclosure,
some
state
official
can
excuse
the
individual
from
compliance,
that
that
would
be
a
constitutional
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
that
be
the
proper
inference
from
the
statute
that
i
just
described
to
you,
that
the
state's
motives
were
benign,
not
malign?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
in
the
case
of
my
hypothetical,
in
which
the
statute
contains
the
circuit
breaker,
would
you
infer
by
virtue
of
the
circuit
breaker's
existence
that
the
state's
interest
was
a
constitutionally
cognizable
one?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
your
argument,
basically
i
guess
you
make
two
arguments.
one
is
that
you
will
either
deter
fraud,
or
you'll
make
it
easier
to
detect
and
prosecute
fraud,
and
you
will
allow
voters
to
evaluate
what
is
said
on
the
kind
of
the
theory
of,
from
whence
it
comes.
what
do
you
say
about
the
argument
that
somebody
who
really
wants
to
thwart
those
interests
is
simply
not
only
going
to
lie
once
but
lie
twice,
and
put
down
the
wrong
name
and
address?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
is
there
reason
to
believe
that
this
is
going
to
be
effective
in
the
cases
that
you
posit?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the
state's
interest
has
to
be
evaluated
in
a
realistic
fashion,
and
i
guess
you're
telling
me
you
have
found
no
instances,
there
are
no
instances
on
the
record
or
disclosed
in
any
of
the
amicus
briefs
here,
in
which
that
kind
of
double
fraud
has
been
perpetrated,
and
therefore
has
rendered
the
state's
interest
one
of
hope,
rather
than
of
realistic
expectation.
