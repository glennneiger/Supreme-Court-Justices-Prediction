do
you
think
the

was

the

that

being

yes.

no,

it
was
surely
was
to

an

that's
what

of

the

it
was

margaret
mcintyre
was
fined
$100
for
distributing
anonymous
handbills
outside
the
public
meeting
at
the
blendon
middle
school
in
westerville
ohio,
whether
superintendent
of
schools
was
discussing
an
imminent
referendum
on
a
proposed
school
tax
levy.
this
is
mcintyre
leaflets
were
addressed
to
concern
citizens
and
taxpayers,
they
criticize
the
tax
proposal.
a
school
board
official
filed
a
complaint
against
mrs.
mcintyre,
respondent
the
ohio
election
commission
for
violating
in
ohio
statute
that
makes
it
a
crime
for
anyone
to
distribute
any
writing
designed
to
influence
the
voters
in
any
election
unless
that
person
places
her
name
and
address
on
the
writing.
the
ohio
supreme
court
of
upheld
the
fine.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
the
ohio
statute
is
consistent
with
the
first
amendment.
for
the
reason
stated
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse.
the
court
has
previously
recognized
that
anonymous
pamphlets,
leaflets,
brochures
and
even
books
have
played
an
important
role
in
the
progress
of
mankind.
one
of
the
best
known
examples
is
the
federalist,
a
collection
of
papers
that
played
an
important
role
in
the
ratification
of
our
constitution.
the
federalist
papers
is
resigned
under
the
name
publius
that
were
actually
written
by
three
of
our
greatest
founding
fathers,
james
madison,
alexander
hamilton
and
john
jay.
many
great
literary
figures
have
also
published
under
assumed
names.
indeed,
dumb
skeptics
believe
william
shakespeare
was
not
the
true
author
of
the
place
published
under
his
name.
in
this
case
we
hold
that
the
first
amendment
recognizes
an
interest
anonymity,
whether
it
is
used
as
a
shield
from
prosecution
as
protection
of
privacy
or
merely
as
an
element
of
the
speakers
message
that
like
any
other
element,
they
speaker
may
include
or
exclude
as
she
sees
fit.
ohio’s
law
because
it
placed
as
burden
and
core
political
speech
and
is
not
a
mere
regulation
of
the
electro
process,
it
subject
to
the
most
exacting
first
amendment
scrutiny.
the
state
takes
the
justified
statute
as
a
method
of
profaned
fraud.
we
are
persuaded
however
that
this
interest
is
insufficient
because
the
statute
is
not
narrowly
tailored
to
serve
that
interest.
ohio
also
argues
that
it
statute
informs
the
electorate
that
like
any
other
part
of
the
speakers
message,
it
is
up
to
the
peaker
to
decide
whether
to
provide
this
information
to
the
public.
she
can
not
be
force
to
inform
simply
for
information
sake.
finally,
we
explained
why
our
opinions
in
first
national
bank
v.
bellotti
and
buckley
v.
valeo,
do
not
command
the
different
result
in
this
case.
bellotti’s
concerned
only
the
scope
of
first
amendment
protection
afforded
to
corporations,
while
buckley
concerned
disclosure
of
campaign
expenditures
in
support
of
a
candidate.
neither
case
decided
whether
government
may
force
the
speaker
to
identify
herself
as
the
proponent
of
a
specific
idea.
we
therefore
holding
that
mrs.
mcintyre
ahead
a
first
amendment
right
to
distribute
her
anonymous
handbills
and
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court.
justice
ginsberg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
thomas
has
