justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
a
question?
the...
think
of
the
ordinary
case,
where
i
think
you'd
say
yes,
the
state
can
in
fact
tell
people
that
they
can
pay...
spend,
contribute
no
more
than
x
amount,
right.
we
agreed
that
they
can
do
that
in
certain
circumstances.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
suppose
the
state
has
an
enforcement
mechanism,
and
i
think
this
is
a
question
that's
been
asked
before,
but
i...
the
enforcement
mechanism
says,
you
have
to
sign
a
paper,
send
it
to
the
commission,
and
say
you've
spent
no
more
than
$10,000.
you
agree
they
could
do
that.
and
moreover,
we
want
a
list
of
everything
you've
spent
the
$10,000
on.
i
take
it
you
say
they
could
do
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
yes,
fine,
and
moreover,
just
to
be
sure,
i
don't
want
you
just
to
have
the
list
mentioning
it
by
general
title.
i
want
you
to
attach,
as
appendix
1,
the
actual
leaflets
that
you've
sent.
i
take
it
you
think
they
could
do
that.
and
my
question
obviously,
is,
they
can
do
all
that,
what's
the
difference...
i
mean,
i
feel
there
is
some
difference,
perhaps,
but
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--oh,
so
in
other
words,
they
could
say,
"we
want
a
list
of
all
the
$10,000
worth
of
stuff
you
spent
it
on.
"
but
they
can't
say,
"and
attach
the
pamphlets"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what's
the...
what
is
the
practical,
that
is
the
functional...
what's
the
reasoning
by
which
it
would
make
sense
to
say,
you
can
in
fact
list
all
these
things
by
name,
you
have
to
list,
i
spent
the
$10,000
on
a,
on
b,
on
c,
but
the
commission
can't
say,
and
attach
as
appendix
1
the
actual
pamphlet
so
we
know
that
you
really
did
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
want
to
say
anything
more
about
the
strength
of
the
state's
interest
in
requiring
this?
in
my
mind
at
the
moment
you're
saying
well,
there
are
really
three,
basically.
one
is
the...
we
don't
want
them
to
lie,
and
we
want
to
know
who's
lying,
so
that
assumes
that
the
person
who
sends
out
a
pamphlet
lying
is
going
to
tell
the
truth
about
who's
doing
it.
that
strikes
me
as
a
little
weak.
the
second
is
that,
well
it
will
help
us
enforce
the
disclosure
laws,
but
you
can
get
quite
far
enforcing
those
disclosure
laws,
i
take
it,
by
simply
requiring
people
to
stick
within
a
list
and
listing
their
expenditures
in
some
way
or
other.
if
so,
does
that
leave
you
with
the
thing,
well,
a
group
of
people,
namely
the
voters
of
the
state
of
ohio,
say,
we
want
to
know
who's
putting
out
this
leaflet,
and
the
person
who's
putting
it
out
says,
well,
i
don't
want
to
tell
you,
and
if
that's
the
conflict,
doesn't
the
first
amendment
require
us
to
come
down
in
favor
of
the
individual?
i'm
putting
that
purposely,
because
i
want
to
get
your
responses
to...
what
i've
done
is
try
to
minimize
the
strength,
and
you'll
try
to
maximize
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why.
why?
that
was
my
question
before,
and
i
wrote
down
the
answer...
buckley.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
got
that
answer.
i
want
to
know
if
there's
anything
more
than
that.
that
is
to
say,
if
you
have
the
voters
of
the
state
of
ohio
who
say,
we
really
would
like
to
know
who
is
putting
this
out,
and
you
have
a
person
who
says,
i
really
don't
want
to
tell
you.
all
right,
now,
why
is
it
that
the
constitution
comes
down
on
the
side
of
the
voters
of
ohio,
given
the
first
amendment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
other
words,
if
the
person...
you
could
have
a
law
which
says,
if,
by
the
way,
you
put
an
argument
in
an
election
campaign,
you
must
legally
put
the
counterargument.
that
might
be
a
very
nice
law,
but
i
mean,
is
that
con...
he
says,
i
don't
want
to
tell
you
the
arguments
against
my
position--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
just
want
to
tell
you
the
ones
for
it.
