justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
we
do
have
an
interest
in
knowing
who
is
the
speaker?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
mrs.
mcintyre
had
hired
other
people
to
put
out
the
leaflets,
might
there
not
have
been
confusion
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the
state
showed
that
there
were
confusion
as
to
who
were
handing
out
leaflets,
would
there
then
be
a
requirement
of
anon...
of
named
persons?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
positing
an
assumption
where
there
are
a
lot
of
leaflets
going
around
and
somebody's
confused
about
who's
writing
the
leaflets.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
that's
not
the
answer
to
the
question
between,
asking
you
to
distinguish
between
television
and
pamphlets.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
this
is
less
restrictive
than
an
expenditure
statute.
the
statute
justice
o'connor
is
telling
you
about
has
two
restrictions,
(a)
limitation
of
expenses,
and
(b)
a
disclosure.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
the
state
can
do
the
greater
and
not
the
lesser.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
saying
that
you
would
assume...
i
interpreted
this
from
your
answer...
that
if
there
were
an
expenditure
limitation,
that
a
disclosure
requirement
might
be
valid.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
it's
constitutional
to
require
that
anytime
anybody
prints
a
leaflet
they
disclose
that
to
an
elections
commission?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
would
have
no
difficulty
with
a
procedure
where,
if
there
were
a
libelous
pamphlet,
the
attorney
for
the
plaintiff
could
take
the
deposition
of
everybody
who
made
a
disclosure
to
the
financing
authorities
and
asked
them,
did
you
print
this
leaflet,
what
leaflets
have
you
printed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
familiar
with
proceedings
in
which
policemen
help
plaintiffs'
lawyers
enforce
civil
libel
actions.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
an
even
worse
specter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
you
were
justifying
the
answers
to
some
of
your
questions
and
to
some
of
these
problems
that
we
confront
by
saying
that
there
are
public
disclosure
requirements
for
many,
many
pamphlets.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
interests
are
the
deterrence
of
fraud
and
informing
the
electorate?
those
are
your
two
interests?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
about
mrs.
mcintyre's
address?
should
that
have
been
on?
wouldn't
that
have
helped
inform
the
electorate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
and
how
about
her
partisan
affiliation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
public
gets
confused
by
too
much
information.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
think
it's
appropriate
to
apply
a
flexible
standard
to
core
political
speech?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
someone
feared
retaliation
and
wanted
to
keep
anonymity,
they'd
go
to
a
court
and
file
a
lawsuit?
i
assume
the
official
on
the
other
side
should
have
some
opportunity
to
be
heard.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
sounds
to
me
like
that
would
deter
at
least
a
rather
shy
person.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
true
of
most
of
the
cases
that
we
get
here.
