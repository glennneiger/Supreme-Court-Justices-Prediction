mr.
david
a.
goldberger
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
first
amendment
permits
the
state
of
ohio
to
criminalize
petitioner's
anonymous
leafleting
in
public
places
because
they're
unsigned
leaflets,
urge
members
of
her
community
to
vote
against
a
tax
increase
in
a
local
referendum.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
it's
the
contention
of
the
state
of
ohio
that
anonymous
political
leaflets
are
unprotected
when
the
leaflets
address
voters,
so
indeed
it
was
a
combination
of
the
anonymity
and
the
fact
that
the
leaflets
were
addressed
to
voters
in
a
coming
election.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
according
to
the...
it's
when
they...
they
address
voters
on
a
referendum
issue,
or
on
an
election,
if
that's
the
thrust
of
the
court's
question.
these
are
not...
it's
not
an
anonymous...
a
flat
prohibition
on
all
anonymous
leafleting,
it's
a
flat
prohibition
on
all
anonymous
election-related
leafleting,
and
in
specific,
the
holding
of
the
court
below
addressed
the
portion
of
the
statute
which
prohibited
anonymous
leafleting
with
respect
to
referenda.
the
events
leading
to
this
case
began
on
april
27th
and
28th
of
1988.
an
open
forum
was
held
at
the
westerville
middle
schools
on
both
of
those
nights
to
discuss
the
merits
of
a
tax
levy
which
was
on
the
may
3rd
ballot.
the
petitioner,
margaret
mcintyre,
distributed
her
leaflets
to
persons
attending
the
meeting.
the
leaflets
were
classic
leaflets
in
the
tradition
of
america
street
corner
leafleters,
were
produced
on
her
home
computer,
and
duplicated
at
a
local
copy
store.
they
were
critical,
sharply
critical
of
school
officials,
and
urged
readers
to
vote
against
the
tax
levy.
a
school
official,
j.
michael
hayfield,
saw
them,
approached
her,
said
that
they
were
unlawful
because
they
did
not
contain
her
name,
and
she
said
she
was
allowed
by
law,
she
thought,
to
distribute
the
leaflets.
the
tax
levy
was
defeated
a
week
later.
it
was
put
on
the
ballot
a
few
months
later
and
defeated
again,
and
a
few
months
after
that
it
went
on
the
ballot
and
finally
passed.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
westerville
is
a
suburb
of
columbus,
ohio.
it's...
i
don't
know
the
precise
population,
your
honor,
but
i'd
assume
it's
40,000
or
50,000
individuals.
it
is
not
a
tiny
little
borough
in
the
rural
areas
of
ohio.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
your
honor,
under
441(d)
of
the
federal
election
campaign
act,
there
is
a
disclosure
requirement
with
respect
to
expenditures
to
produce
leaflets.
it
does
extend--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--no.
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
a
disclosure
requirement
on
any
leaflet,
when
the
leaflet
is
constitutes
core
political
speech
or
is
pure
speech,
would
violate
the
first
amendment.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
i
believe
it--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--your
honor--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--no,
we
do
not,
your
honor,
but
i...
with
all
due
respect,
i
do
believe
441(d)
includes
a
requirement
that
the
name
appear
on
the
face
of
the
leaflet.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
expenditure
disclosure
requirements
are
by
any
means,
when
appropriately
framed,
unlawful
or
unconstitutional,
but
we--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--i
believe
that's
a
different
kind
of
a
case,
your
honor,
because
television
is
a
conduit
for
a
great
variety
of
communication,
and
there's
a
potential
for
confusion
when
a
viewer
is
watching
television
as
to
who's
saying
what
and
under
what
circumstances.
in
addition,
television
as
a
form
of
broadcasting
is
governed
by
the
federal
communications
act,
and
i
believe
is
subject
to
a
separate
and
distinct
set
of
rules.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
you
do
have
an
interest
in
knowing
a
situation
in
which
there
may
be
confusion,
because
the
speaker
appears
to
be
someone
other
than
whom
the
speaker
actually
is,
but
that--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--well,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
the
leaflets
are...
they
speak
for
themselves.
when
you
watch
television,
you
are
hearing
communications
from
a
whole...
a
large
number
of
people
as
you're
viewing
the
television
screen,
and
in
lots
of
situations,
if
you
watch
saturday
night
live,
for
example,
there's
a
lot
of
confusion
as
to
whether
you're
watching
an
advertisement
or
whether
you're
watching
a
comedy
skit.
[laughter]
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
under
those
circumstances,
if
there's
clarity
as
to
who
the
vehicle
is,
i
believe
that
there's...
there
shouldn't
be
an
absolute
necessity
to
place
it
on
the
screen.
but
i
would
respectfully
differ
with
the
court.
i
do
believe
there's
likely
to
be
confusion
under
those
circumstances.
moreover,
you're
dealing
with
political
advertisements
which
substantially
exceed
the
cost
of
the
campaign
expenditure
disclosure
minimums.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
it
seems
to
me
that
to
the
extent
there's
an
interest
in
anonymity
and
there's
no
confusion
as
to
who
is
speaking,
in
light
of
the
fact
that
you
have
the
television
serving
as
the
conduit,
that
is
arguably
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
it
seems
to
me
if
you
had
a
statute...
well,
you
have
statutes
which
deal
with
election
fraud
and
misrepresentation.
we're
not
really
challenging
those
statutes
here.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
i
don't
believe
that's
the
business
of
the
state,
your
honor.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
well,
that
assumes
that
television
is
governed
by
the
same
set
of
ground
rules
that
are
applicable
to
pamphlets.
i
believe
because
of
the
federal
communications
act
and
the
red
lion
decision,
this
court
has
decided
that
there
are
separate
sets
of
ground
rules
that
are
applicable.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
well,
red
lion
is
not
only
a
spectrum
scarcity
case,
your
honor,
it's
also
a
case
which
deals
with
the
problem
of
having
a
conduit
of
communication
going
into
the
home
which...
there
is
an
immediate
impact
in
which
there
is
a
potential
for
confusion.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
voters
are
capable
of
deciding
for
themselves.
they
operate
in
a
political
climate--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--in
my
view,
your
honor,
it
is
constitutional
in
the
context
of
broadcasting,
because
i
believe
broadcasting
poses
a
separate
question.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
that's
correct.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
i
believe
that...
i
believe
that's
true,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
that
these
are
not
political
ads.
the
difference
between
a
commercial
ad,
or
a
political
advertisement
on
a
television,
is
that
it
is
paid
for...
paid
for
in
sums
that
exceeds
the
expenditure
disclosure
minimums,
and
there
is
a
very
different
kind
of
a
state
interest
involved
when
large
sums
of
money
are
involved
in
the
election
process.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
in
a
broadcast,
or
just
on
the
flier?
no,
i
don't--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--that
would
track
441(d),
your
honor.
as
we
read
441(d),
i
believe
that
the
appropriate
disclosure
is
not
on
the
face
of
the
leaflet,
but
it
is
to
the
appropriate
election
commission.
however,
because
this
court
has
taken
the
position
that
expenditure
disclosure
requirements
are
appropriate
under
some
circumstances,
i
think
it's
a
judgment
call
for
the
court
as
to
whether
or
not
it
would
also
require
disclosure
on
the
face
of
the
leaflet.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
i
believe
that
should
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
your
honor,
441(d)
addresses
the
question
of
expenditures.
this
is
a
question
of
pure
speech.
this
is
not
a
disclosure
requirement
which
addresses
the
question
of
expenditures.
ohio's
laws
say,
all
persons
shall
put
their
names
on
their
leaflets.
it
does
not
frame
it
in
terms
of
people
who
will
make
expenditures,
and--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--i--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--no,
i...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
court's
question.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
well,
a
disclosure
requirement,
i
believe
a
disclosure
requirement
to
the
election
commission
would
be
appropriate.
i
don't
believe
such
a
disclosure
requirement
ought
to
be
required
on
the
face
of
the
leaflet
when
the
leaflet
is
pure
speech
and
is
completely
protected.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
no,
i
believe
that's
not
so.
i
believe
that
it
is
appropriate,
or
consistent
with
this
court's
decision
in
buckley,
however,
that
when
someone
expends
a
certain
amount
of
money
in
excess
of
a
threshold
minimum,
that
they
can
be
compelled
to
disclose
the
expenditure
to
the
election
commission.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
no--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
minimum
has
constitutional...
has
a
constitutional
element
to
the
extent
that
it
is
a
minimum
which
interferes
with
the
ability
of
street
corner
leafleters
to
disseminate
their
views
and
to
articulate
their
views,
and
for
others
that
have
a
legitimate
basis
for
remaining
anonymous
because
of
their
fear
of
retaliation,
the
kind
of
retaliation
which
the
justice
below
suggested
might
have
existed
in
this
case,
that
there
is
anonymity
and
that
any
threshold
requirement
has
to
leave
room
for
that
anonymity.
the
state's
central
arguments
that...
the
ohio...
i
beg
your
pardon.
the
ohio
supreme
court
rested
its
decision
on
the
fact
that
this
case
and
this
statute
should
be
reviewed
by
a
relaxed
level
of
scrutiny.
it
took
the
position
that
because
3599.09
is
an
election
regulation,
it
is
not...
it
not
need
be
reviewed
by
the
usual
high
level
of
scrutiny
that
this
court
applies
to
first
amendment
communications,
and
those
communications
that
ordinarily
occur
in
the
election
context.
it
rejected
talley,
in
short,
on
grounds
that
petitioner's
leaflets
addressed
voters
on
discrimination,
while
talley
addressed
passers-by.
excuse
me.
it
rejected
petitioner's
leaflets
because
it
addressed
voters
in
a
referendum,
while
talley
addressed
passers-by
on
the
issue
of
race
discrimination.
the
ohio
supreme
court
was
wrong.
3599.09
is
invalid
because
it
is
not
a
regulation
of
the
mechanics
of
the
election
process,
it
is
a
regulation
of
pure
speech.
it
interferes
with
the
flow
of
speech
to
inform
voters,
it
deters
criticisms
of
public...
it
deters
criticisms
of
public
officials
by
those
individuals
who
would
prefer
to
remain
anonymous
because
of
a
fear
of
potential
retaliation.
it--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--i
believe
that
the
court
should
draw
a
line
between
individuals
like
mcintyre
and
corporations.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
it
seems
to
me--
[laughter]
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
those
matters
can
be
handled
through
expenditure
disclosure
requirements.
this
court
has
sustained
them
in
buckley,
and
to
the
extent
the
court
treats
them
as
valid
requirements
under
the
first
amendment,
the
rich
speaker
can
be
reached
under
the
first
amendment,
and
i
might
add,
the
state
of
arizona
has
used
precisely
this
approach.
it
has
repealed
a
statute
much
like
3599.09,
and
replaced
it
with
an
expenditure
disclosure
requirement
and
a
disclosure
requirement
on
the
face
of
leaflets
which
is
limited
to
political
committees,
and
requires
only
the
disclosure
of
the
names
of
major
donors
to
those
political
committees
where
the
donor
has
contributed
a
very
substantial
sum
of
money.
as
a
consequence,
and
the
sections,
the
relevant
sections
are
cited
in
footnote
2
of
the
state's
brief--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--as
i
read
the
new
statute,
your
honor,
you
disclose
the
name
of
one
donor,
the
major
donor,
one
or
two
donors
who
have
contributed
a
substantial
sum
of
money
on
the
leaflet.
i'm
not
arguing
that
that's
a
valid
requirement.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
state
of
arizona
has
taken
a
step
back
from
the
flat
ban
of
statutes
like
3599.09.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
well,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--i
don't
have
any
difficulty
in
compelling
the
name
of
the
political
committee
to
be
placed
on
the
leaflet,
and
i
also
don't
have
any
difficulty
with
substantial
contributors
being
compelled
to
disclose
their
expenditures
and
contributions
to
the
election
campaign
commission.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
rely
on
those
cases,
but
i
believe
that
the
state
statute
in
ohio
contains
no
exception
whatsoever,
and
the
difficulty
with
the
statute
is
that
it's
a
flat
ban
on
anonymous
leafleting.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
the
state
has
valid
libel
and
fraud
laws,
and
it
can
use
those
laws.
the
diff--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
to
quote
the...
well,
first
of
all,
to
quote
the
state's
brief,
prevaricators
cannot
be
expected
to
point
a
beacon
at
their
own
lies.
those
who
are
engaged...
and
that's
page
18...
and
those
who
intend
to
defraud
or
lie
in
one
way
or
another
are
hardly
likely
to
deal
with
putting
their...
are
hardly
likely
to
put
their
names
on
the
pamphlets.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
well,
your
honor,
libel
is
unlikely
in
a
referendum
election,
or
at
least
the
kind
of
libel
that
this
court
should
be...
how
do
you...
it
is...
i
believe
it's
impossible
to
libel
a
referendum,
to
the
ex--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--well,
i
will
say
that
i
believe
that
sounds
a
great
deal
like
political
advocacy
to
me.
to
the
extent
that
libel
is...
he
has
a
libel
action,
he
can
file
his
libel
action.
these
are
matters
that
ought
to
be
corrected
in
the--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--but
he
will
find
out,
if
necessary,
by
going
to
the...
if
a
disclosure
requirement
is
imposed,
by
going
to
the
election
campaign--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--no.
on
the
contrary,
they've
chosen
a
flat
ban
on
all
anonymous
leaflets.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
your
honor,
i
will
agree
that
there
is
a
state
interest
in
ferreting
out
individuals
who
have
engaged
in
libel
which
affect
the
election
process,
but
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
can
do
it
at
the
expense
of
individuals
who
are
engaged
in
pure
speech,
who
wish
to
remain
anonymous,
and
who
will
otherwise
not
distribute
their
leaflets
or
make
their
political
statements
in
political
literature.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
that's
true.
she
was...
she
stated
that
when
she
appeared
pro
se
before
the
election
commission.
however--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--well,
going
into
this
thing,
it
didn't
appear
that
that
was
the
case,
and
her
position
was,
before
the
commission,
that
she
had
attempted
to
comply
with
the
statute,
and
it
was
basically
a
trap
for
the
unwary.
but
as
events
unfolded,
the
complaint
against
her
wasn't
filed
until
a
year
after
the
leafleting
actually
occurred,
and
three
election
referenda
later,
when
it
finally
passed.
at
that
point,
the
school
officials
who
she
had
criticized
initiated
and
pressed
the
proceedings
against
her.
she
had,
as
a
consequence
she
has
a
fine,
or
had
a
fine
that
still
is
a
valid
fine.
moreover,
she
and
every
other
resident
of
the
village
or
city
of
westerville
are
now
on
notice
that
when
they
take
on
school
officials
in
these
tax
levy
referenda,
they
do
so
knowing
that
the
school
officials
are
going
to
fight
back,
and
very
hard.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
well,
your
honor,
there
are
going
to
be...
in
my
view,
individuals
who
do
not
expend
sufficient
funds
to
make
them
legitimate
targets
of
campaign
expenditure
laws
should
be
left
alone,
and
she
would
not
have...
making
a
leaflet
on
a
home
computer,
duplicating
at
the
local
copy
store
would
not
have
placed
her
within
the
reach
of
an
appropriately
drafted
statute.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
when
you
have...
if
you
have...
now,
we're
talking
new
york
times
v.
sullivan
libel,
i
assume,
but
to
the
extent
that
you
have
some
kind
of
a
criminal
libel,
you
have
law
enforcement
tools
which
are
readily
available
with
or
without
these
kinds
of
statutes,
and
anyone
can
be
asked
by
an
appropriate
law
enforcement
official
who--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--oh,
i
see.
i
misunderstood
the
question.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it's
the
function
of
the
state
election
laws
to
help
civil
libel
litigants.
the
function
of
the
state
election
laws--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--but
the
purpose
of
any
public
disclosure
requirement,
your
honor,
is
to
assist
the
state
in
making
sure
that
there
is
not
an
election
fraud
which
will
affect
the
outcome
of
an
election.
the
purpose
of
those
statutes
is
not
to
provide
a
civil
action
or
facilitate
a
civil
action
by
someone
who
has
a
complaint
about
the
contents
of
an
election
leaflet.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
right.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
i
would
prefer
they
couldn't,
but
i
think
the
court
has
said
that.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
well,
i
don't
believe
they
can...
i
don't
think
they
can
do
that
under
circumstances
in
which
the
individual
can
legitimately
claim
a
need
for
anonymity.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
i
believe...
well,
at
that
point
we
would
be
dealing
with
this
court's
holding
in
brown
v.--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--i
believe,
your
honor,
that
is
the
problem
that
this
court
faced
in
the
disclosure
requirements
with
respect
to
the
unpopular
political
parties.
at
a
certain
point,
the
state
cannot
constitutionally
require
it.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
because
of
the
interest
in
anonymity,
and
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
interest,
she
must
be
left
alone.
the
difficulty--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--yes,
but
we're
now...
the
questions
that
have
been
put
to
me,
your
honor--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--your
honor,
because
the
statute
is
a
flat
ban,
the
statute
falls
of
its
own
weight.
we
are...
i
am
being
put...
questions
are
being
put
to
me
on
a
hypothetical
statute
which
would
be
formed...
framed
and
formed
in
the
form
of
a
disclosure,
expenditure
disclosure
requirement,
and
that
is
a
separate
question.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
your
honor,
to
the
extent
that
buckley
v.
valeo
allows
expenditure
disclosures,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
to
the
extent
that
the
state
is
trying
to
learn
about
expenditure
disclosure
and...
expenditures
in
election,
and
not
trying
to
regulate
the
content
of
protected
leaflets,
yes,
it
would
be
a
valid
requirement,
to
the--
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
--well,
if
it's
not
benign,
i
don't
understand
why
they're
asking
for
the
information,
why
they
need
the
information.
mr.
david
a.
goldberger
i
believe
so
in
candidate
elections.
i
have
my
doubts,
sir,
in
referendum
elections,
because
of
the
fact
that
you
cannot
libel
a
referendum.
