that's
all
it
applies
to,
is
radio
and
television
advertising.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
can,
in
any
and
all
radio
and
television
ads,
the
state
legitimately
can
require
identification
of
the
speaker?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
mr.--
--well,
then,
if
ohio
had
a
ceiling
on
the
amount
of
money
that...
it
said,
ms.
mcintyre
can
do
her
flier
as
long
as
she's
not
spending
over
$500
on
it,
that
would
be
okay?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
the
thing
was
the
spending
of
money,
substantial
amounts
of
money.
suppose
this
very
same
statute,
but
it
has
a
dollar
limit
under
which
you
don't
have
to
disclose
your
name.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
first
bank
of
boston,
the
bellotti
case,
where
the
court
said
that
that
law
was
unconstitutional
but
a
disclosure
requirement
would
be
okay?
are
you
drawing
a
line
between
individuals
like
mcintyre
and
corporations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
rich
individuals
versus
poor
corporations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
case,
she
didn't
wish
to
remain
anonymous.
wasn't
the
testimony
that
she
meant
to
put
her
name
on
the
leaflet?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wouldn't
she
have
been
in
exactly
the
same
position
if
she
didn't
have
to
put
her
name
on
the
leaflet,
but
she
did
have
to
register
with
the
election
commission
so
that
mean
school
official
that...
could
have
found
out
her
name
that
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--distinction
between
big
spenders
and
little
spenders?
if
you
take
the
campaign
act
as
a
model,
even
if
the
limits
are
pretty
low,
there
are
limits.
you
go
below
those
limits,
you
don't
have
to
disclose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
to
draw
the
line,
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
the
court
say
there
didn't
have
to
be
any
line,
so
that
people
who
don't
spend
any
money
still
have
to
report?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
my
distinction
wasn't
in
terms
of
the
character
of
the
identity,
but
of...
does
there
need
to
be
some
point
below
which,
if
you're
not...
if
the
concern
is
big
spending,
mustn't
you
have
some
limit
to
leave
out
the
little
people
like
ms.
mcintyre?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--recognize
that
to
be
compatible
with
the
first
amendment
there
would
at
least
have
to
be
an
exception
for
the
socialist
worker
party
kind
of
case,
where
the
person
said,
if
i
put
my
name...
if
i
put
my
name
on
this
piece
of
literature,
i
may
be
subject
to
assault,
or
some
danger?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
suppose
ms.
mcintyre,
instead
of
saying,
"here
i
am,
i
want
my
neighbors
to
know
what
i
think.
"
had
said,
"i
want
to
get
across
this
message,
but
i'm
going
to
be
in
grave
danger
if
i
am
so
bold
as
to
oppose
this
powerful
principal,
or
superintendent
of
the
school
district.
"
--suppose
that
were
her
position.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
there
have
to
be
an
exception
of
that
type?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
necessary.
appropriate
is
not
what
we
decide.
would
it
be
necessary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
sutter--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--justice
o'connor
brought
up
the
tradition
of
pamphleteering,
going
back
to
the
federalist
papers.
i
was
thinking
of
a
case
that
we
had
last
term,
the
city
of
ladue
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
about,
it
was
traditional,
accepted
that
you
could
have
unobtrusive
signs
on
your
own
property.
isn't
there
the
same
kind
of
venerable
tradition
attached
to
the
lone
leafleter
in
this
country?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't
buckley
focus
on
candidates,
support
of
candidates
as
distinguished
from
issues?
indeed,
didn't
the
court
say
in
buckley
that
there
would
be
concern
if
the
provision
were
interpreted
to
reach
groups,
instead
of
candidate-supporting
groups,
groups
engaged
purely
in
issue
discussions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--most
people
in
ohio
don't
know
a
thing
about
the
existence
of
this
law?
[laughter]
