mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
court's
dialogue
with
mr.
goldberger
demonstrates
just
how
much
this
case
is
controlled
by
bellotti
and
buckley.
in
bellotti,
we
have
footnote
32,
which
specifically
states,
in
the
heart
of
a
case
in
which
campaign
contributions,
or
a
limitation
on
campaign
contributions
was
struck
down,
that
the
effective
vehicle
in
these
instances
is
a
disclosure
statute,
one
where
the
advertiser,
the
person
circulating
the
handbill
or
making
the
television
advertisement,
discloses
his
or
her
identity.
there's
no
distinction
between
those
circumstances
and
these.
in
fact,
bellotti
was--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--justice
ginsburg,
in
buckley,
the
court
recognized
how
low
the
thresholds
really
were
before
someone
had
to
report,
but
the
court
said
in
that
case
that
that
was
a
legislative
call.
in
bellotti,
the
whole--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--where
to
draw
the
line.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
well,
your
honor,
in
bellotti
the
court
decided
that
there
was
no
distinction,
especially
in
the
context
of
ballot
measure
elections,
between
corporations
and
individuals,
that
their
first
amendment
rights
were
coextensive,
so
i
don't
understand
how
there
could
be
a
principled
basis
upon
which
one
could
require
a
corporation
to
disclose
just
because
they
were
better
heeled
and
might
be
able
to
communicate
more
effectively.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
no,
your
honor,
because
the
only
concern
before
the
court
in
buckley
was
not
just
campaign
contributions
and
expenditures,
some
sort
of
threshold
to
distinguish
big
money
from
small
money,
the
court
specifically
recognized,
as
a
distinct
and
independent
compelling
interest,
the
disclosure
of
information
that
was
important
to
the
electorate
to
help
them
evaluate
candidates.
in
this
case...
and
in
that
instance,
it
was
the
associates
of
the
candidate.
in
the
case
at
bar,
this
state
statute
does
the
same
thing
in
the
context
of
a
referendum.
it
identifies
the
person
who
is
circulating
literature
opposing
or
promoting
a
ballot
issue,
and
it
provides
the
name
of
that
person
as
information
to
the
electorate,
and
i
contend
there's
no
distinction
between
that
interest
in
a
ballot
measure
election
and
the
interest
of
disclosing
the
associations
of
a
candidate
in
a
candidate
election.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
your
honor,
there
are
two.
one
is
the
deterrence
of
fraud,
and
the
other
is--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--yes,
there
are,
your
honor,
but
these
circumstances
are
very
similar
to
buckley,
for
example,
where
the
court
recognized
the
existence
of
bribery
statutes.
certainly,
bribery
statutes
could
have
been
enough
to
defeat,
or
was
a
minimum
restriction
on
speech
that
could
have
been
utilized
to
deter
campaign
candidate
corruption,
but
nevertheless,
the
court
still
upheld
disclosure.
in
burson,
the
court
recognized
in
tennessee
that
there
were
voter
intimidation
laws
on
the
books
that
could
have
been
utilized
to
deter
the
same
sort
of
evil
conduct
that
the
court
was
trying
to
deter
in
burson,
but
nevertheless
upheld
the
campaign
free
zone.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
no,
your
honor.
we
think
this
is
a
much
more
limited
statute
that
addresses
only
campaign
literature
or
broadcast
media.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
your
honor,
the
circumstances
then
were
somewhat
different.
we
think
that
the
protections
of
the
first
amendment
make
a
difference,
but
if
today
the
federalist
papers
were
being
circulated,
we
would
argue
that
the
state
had
a
compelling
interest
in
requiring
the
speakers
to
place
their
name
on
the
literature.
there
would
be
no
difference,
and
that
is
our
point
here.
there
is
no
principled
way
to
distinguish
different
types
of
campaign
literature,
distinguishing
the
well
heeled,
or
those
who
are
capable
of
communicating
more
effectively,
with
those
who
do
so
on
a
smaller
level.
this
court
has
recognized
that
there's
really...
there's
no
justification
for
treating
or
restricting
the
rights
of
groups,
for
example,
to
the
advantage
of
individuals.
in
berkeley,
in
bellotti,
the
court
recognized
that
there
are
first
amendment
rights
associated
with
groups
being
able
to
go
over
and...
go
out
and
speak
together,
and
that
there
was
no
distinction
made
there.
there
wasn't
a
tier
of
protected
rights
established
so
that
groups
or
effective
speakers
would
be
able...
that
the
state
would
place
more
restrictions
on
their
speech
than
on
individuals.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
yes,
your
honor.
we
think
that
this
statute
serves
a
parallel
interest
as
the
statute
in
buckley,
where
the
court
said
that
information
important
to
the
voter,
information
that
enables
the
voter
to
place
a
candidate
in
the
political
spectrum--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that's
required
by
the
law.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
your
honor,
we
think
there
is
a
point
at
which
too
much
information
would
cross
the
line.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
no,
your
honor--
[laughter]
--but
we
are
not
ignoring
or
denying
that
there's
an
interest
in
political
speech
here.
certainly
the
state
couldn't
require
margaret
mcintyre
to
fill
up
the
literature
to
the
point
that
it
eliminated
room
for
her
message.
what
we
are
saying
here
is
that
all
this
statute
does
is,
it
makes
a
minimum
amount...
it
requires
a
minimum
amount
of
disclosure,
enough
to
identify
the
speaker.
one
of
the
points
that
came
up
during
the
course
of
mr.
goldberger's
argument
is
that
this
type
of
law
is
actually
less
intrusive
of
first
amendment
rights
than
campaign
finance
laws
are,
and
we
would
submit,
especially
for
someone
like
margaret
mcintyre.
in
our
instance,
the
person
puts
their
name
and
address
on
the
page
of
their
advertisement,
they
mass
produce
it,
they
distribute
it,
they
never
come
in
contact
with
the
government,
there
are
no
burdensome
filing
requirements.
in
the
buckley
case--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--your
honor,
the
state
would
acknowledge
that
there's
core
political
speech
involved
here,
but
there's
a
difference,
we
think,
between
the
ability
to
deliver--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--your
honor,
the
court
below--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--no,
your
honor,
the
court
did
not
apply
strict
scrutiny,
but
under
the
circumstances,
we
believe,
regardless
of
what
test
the
court
applies,
whether
it
be
the
flexible
standard
under
anderson
v.
celebrezze,
or
strict
scrutiny,
this
statute
passes
constitutional
muster
because
it
serves
compelling
interests.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
your
honor,
i
think
when
there's
a
competing
interest
of
equal
importance,
as
there
is
in
this
case,
protecting
the
right
to
vote,
that
a
flexible
approach
has
appeal
in
that
it
permits
the
court
to
measure
the
amount
of
intrusion
against
the
interest
of
the
state,
but
under
the
circumstances,
the
court
never
has
to
reach
that
question,
because
we
believe
that
the
statute
involves
serves
compelling
state
interests,
and
addressing--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
your
honor,
that
really
goes
to
an
overbreadth
question,
and
we
do
believe--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--your
honor,
we
think
that
the
ohio
courts
would
construe
the
statute
in
constitutional
fashion,
just
as
this
court
did
in
the
buckley
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
we
think
that
that
would
be
appropriate.
we
don't
think
it's
fatal--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--we
would
concede
even
necessary,
but
we
don't
think
it's
fatal
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
that
it's
silent
on
the
subject,
any
more
than
it
was
fatal
to
the
statute
in
buckley.
we
think
that
that's
a
question,
when
the
facts
present
themselves,
that
the
ohio
courts
will
deal
with
appropriately,
that
they
will
give
it
the
appropriate
constitutional
construction,
but
here,
there
is
no
evidence
of
retaliation.
there
is
no
evidence
of
fear.
mrs.
mcintyre
testified
at
the
ohio
elections
commission
hearing
that
some
of
the
leaflets
that
she
circulated
indeed
contained
her
name
and
address,
that
she
had
intended
to
include
them
in
all
of
her
brochures,
on
all
her
leaflets,
so
this
does
not
raise
the
specter
of
legitimate
fear
of
retaliation.
the
similarities
between...
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
your
honor,
i
think
there
would
be
an
opportunity
for
something
like
a
jane
doe
lawsuit,
but
i
don't
think
this
is
so
different--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--your
honor--
[laughter]
i
think
the
court...
i
can't
stand
here
and
argue
to
the
court
that
there
aren't
prospects
or
possibilities
for
deterrence
of
speech,
for
chilling
of
speech,
but
that
was
exactly
the
circumstances
in
buckley.
the
court
recognized
that
the
campaign
finance
disclosure
requirements
could
chill
speech,
but
the
court
hesitated
in
striking
down
the
statute
on
the
prospect,
the
speculation
of
potential
harm,
and
instead
decided
that
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
where
there
would
be
an
opportunity
to
demonstrate
harm,
that
that
would
render
the
statute
not
applicable
to
those
particular
circumstances,
and
all
we
are
asking
is
for
the
same
sort
of
discretion
to
be
extended
to
the
state
courts.
we
think
there's
very
little
difference
between
the
buckley
circumstances.
the
parallels
are
remarkable,
and
i
think
that
the
court
has
identified
through
the
course
of
this
argument
some
of
the
dangers
to
existing
statutory
law
if
the
petitioner's
side
prevails.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
i
think
there
is
a
tradition.
i
think
the
aspect
of
anonymity
changes
the
perspective
of
the
case.
we're
not
saying,
and
didn't
say
to
margaret
mcintyre,
that
she
couldn't
speak,
that
she
couldn't
hand
out
literature,
that
she
couldn't
say
whatever
she
wanted
in
that
literature.
all
we're
saying
is,
because
of
the
countervailing
state
interest
in
protecting
the
electoral
process,
that
we
may...
that
the
state
may
require
her
to
provide
the
public
with
access
to
a
limited
amount
of
pertinent
information
to
help
them
make
better
educated
electoral
choices,
and
i
think
that
under
the
circumstances
where
you
have
these
competing
interests,
that
the
court
has
recognized
in
the
past
that
occasionally
first
amendment
core
speech
has
to
yield
to
this
greater
interest,
especially
whereas
here,
it
is
a
minimal
intrusion.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
well,
your
honor,
we
can't
completely
control
the
conduct
of
anyone
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
yes,
we
do,
and
it's
been
followed
on
a
regular
basis.
i
mean,
there's
very
robust
political
activity
in
ohio,
and
this
disclaimer
has,
this
attribution
requirement
has
been
placed
on
literature.
i
don't
think
the
state
can
determine
what
it's
going
to
try
to
deter,
or
how
it's
going
to
regulate,
based
on
those
who
would
try
to
evade
the
law,
otherwise
that
would
be
true
of
almost
any
criminal
or
civil
enforcement
statute.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
there's
nothing
in
this
record
to
demonstrate
that.
i
suppose
it
could
happen,
but
i
don't
think
that
would
be
sufficient
to
invalidate
the
scope
of
the
law.
the
state
can't
regulate
under
those
circumstances,
if
they're
going
to
be
concerned
about
who
will
try
to
evade
it.
and
this
statute
here...
another
similarity
that
i'd
like
to
point
out
with
the
buckley
case
is
that
in
buckley
the
court
struck
down
limitations
on
expenditures,
identifying
that
as
intruding
on
core
political
speech,
but
it
retained...
it
validated
the
disclosure
requirement,
and
that's
the
same
sort
of
statute
that
we
have
here.
if
one
looks
at
buckley
and
bellotti,
especially
at
the
bellotti
footnote,
that
authorizes
this
kind
of
attribution,
it
links
buckley
and
bellotti.
it
cites
buckley
for
the
same
proposition
that
the
state
is
citing
it
for
today,
and
that
has
two
important
characteristics.
one
is
that
buckley
addressed
not
just
groups
but
individuals,
and
it
links
them
in
a
way
that
they
are
both
disclosure
statutes,
that
they
are
both
constitutional.
i
think
the
court
asked
before
whether
we
could
require
mrs.
mcintyre
and
others
to
file
with
the
ohio
elections
commission.
well,
we
think
we
could,
but
we
have
chosen
a
different
vehicle
that
we
think
is
less
intrusive.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
all
right.
i'll
do
my
best,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i'll
start
backwards,
if
i
may.
first,
i
think
the
court
has
articulated
the
interest
that
was
recognized
in
buckley
that
there
was
an
independent
justification
for
upholding
the
disclosure
laws,
and
that
was
to
provide
information
to
the
electorate,
important
information
to
help
them
evaluate
the
candidates.
and
i
think
it's
striking
in
the
context
of
buckley
that
the
court
not
only
required
disclosure
of
identity,
but
disclosure
of
associations,
a
much
more
severe
restriction
and
disclosure
requirement
than
just
placing
your
own
name
and
address
on
your
literature,
so
we
think
that
this
regulation
is
even
less
demanding
and
less
intrusive
of
first
amendment
rights.
then
the
campaign
finance
requirements
of
buckley--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
these
laws
started
to
appear
in
the
early
portion
of
the
20th
century,
around
1910,
1915,
at
the
same
time
that
other
types
of
campaign
reform
was
underway,
as
the
court
noted
in
burson,
with
the
australian
ballot
procedure,
and
these
particular
statutes
have
extended
on
through
the
years.
that's
where
they
began
as
part
of
an
effort
to...
an
election
campaign
reform.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
yes,
your
honor.
some
statutes
in
1912,
the...
there
is
a
case
discussing
the
ohio
statute,
the
predecessor
to
the
ohio
statute,
as
early
as
1922,
but
the
statute
was
in
existence
for
years
before
that,
and
that's,
i
think,
a
good
point,
is
that
this
is
all
part
of
the
same
reform
movement
in
electoral
politics.
the
court
recognized
in
buckley
that
the
disclosure
requirement
was
part
of
congress'
effort
at
total
disclosure.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
yes,
your
honor.
that's
explicit
in
buckley.
the
buckley...
the
buckley
court
identified
three
compelling
interests,
each
of
which
would
justify
the
law,
and
one
of
them
was
to
help
evaluate
the
candidate's
position
by
placing
him
in
the
political
spectrum.
and
how
did
they
do
that?
how
do
campaign
finance
laws
do
that?
they
do
that
by
requiring
the
candidate
to
reveal
not
just
his
name,
and
his
address,
and
the
way
he
or
she
may
have
spent
money,
but
in
terms
of
parties--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--his
associations.
that's
a
far
more--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--your
honor,
the
court
did
say
that,
but
in
the
context
of
buckley,
the
first
answer
is
that
there
are
no
referenda
or
initiatives,
actual
issues
that
go
on
the
ballot,
in
federal
law.
the
other
answer
is,
and
the
one
that
i
think
gets
directly
to
the
point,
is
that
i
think
what
the
court
was
talking
about
there,
and
why
they
narrowed
the
statute
to
express
advocacy,
is
something
that
this
statute
doesn't
regulate,
which
is
the
general
discussion
of
political
events
in
society.
this
statute
doesn't
reach
beyond
campaign
literature,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
was
concerned
about
in
buckley.
they
were
concerned
that...
unless
i
get
attacked
here...
they
were
concerned
by
this
whole
notion
of
it
spreading
beyond
campaign
literature
to
just
general
discussion.
that's
why,
in
the
normal
course
of
events,
the
federalist
papers
as
they
actually
appeared,
as
they
actually
were
utilized,
wouldn't
have
been
affected
by
this
law,
because
it
was
not
in
the
context
of
a
popular
election.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
was
not
designed--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--your
honor,
what
this
statute
pertains
to,
it's
not
attempting
to
control
public
discussion
of
public
policy
or
foreign
affairs.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
yes,
your
honor.
in
ohio,
an
issue
is
what
appears
on
the
ballot.
it
is
the
actual
question
that
the
electorate
goes
to
the
polls
to
address.
it
is
in
the
context
of
a
popular
election.
the
whole
statutory
scheme
is
directed
toward
campaign
activity.
it
is
an
election
law.
now,
it
may
regulate
political
speech,
but
it's
still
an
election
law...
it
only
comes
up
in
that
context...
just
as
provisions
against
trying
to
bribe
an
electorate
or
an
election
official
is
a
campaign
election
law.
we
don't
think
there
has
been
a
principled
justification
articulated
either
by
mr.
goldberger
today,
or
in
petitioner's
brief,
that
would
distinguish
the
buckley
situation
and
the
bellotti
situation
from
the
case
at
bar,
and
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--your
honor,
but
it
follows...
in
every
single
one
of
the
court's
decisions
limiting
campaign
contributions
and
expenditures
to
one
extent
or
another,
the
court
makes
a
point--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--but
the
court
makes
a
point...
in
buckley,
in
bellotti,
in
citizens
against
rent
control
v.
berkeley,
the
court
makes
a
point
of
indicating
that
disclosure
requirements
are
the
least
intrusive
method
for
regulating
lections
in
this
way.
they
mention
it
time...
the
court
mentions
it
time
and
time
again,
as
if
it's
a
running
theme
that
disclosure...
a
message
to
the
public,
to
the,
as
you
might,
the
legislatures
of
all
the
states,
saying
that
disclosure
is
appropriate,
and
that's
what
ohio
has
chosen
to
do
here.
we
can't
serve
these
compelling
interests,
i
don't
think,
serve
them
both
in
the
same
statute,
any
more
narrowly.
all
we're
asking
for
here
is
a
minimal
amount
of
additional
information
so
that
the
electorate
can
evaluate
the
campaign
message.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
your
honor,
i
think
that
is
a
difficult
question,
and
one
that
the
legislature
wrestled
with,
and
i
think
this
court
in
a
way
wrestled
with
it
in
buckley.
i
mean,
the
circumstances
were
the
same.
if
one
eliminates
from
the
buckley
scenario
the
limitations
on
campaign
expenditures,
or
the
limitation
on
campaign
contributions,
that
there
still
remains
this
independent
compelling
state
interest
of
disclosure
of
information.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
can
we
assume--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--yes,
your
honor.
the
general
assembly--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--yes,
and
there
hasn't
been
any--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--your
honor,
there
haven't
been
any
initiatives
or
referenda
on
the
ballot
to
repeal
it.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
i
think
that's
correct,
and
that
reflects--
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
--your
honor,
i
wouldn't
want
to
speculate
either
way,
but
i
would
say
that
the
vast
majority
of
legislators
in
the
congress
think
that
this
is
important
legislation.
they
think
that
it
outweighs
any
interest
in
anonymity
because
it
doesn't
affect
the
person's
right
to
speak,
and
i
think,
your
honor,
justice
o'connor,
that
here
the
state
perhaps
could
have
decided
not
to
do
this,
but
that
doesn't
minimize
the
interest.
the
state
still
had
the
interest
in
providing
this
sort
of
limited
information
to
help
voters
evaluate
ballot
issues.
there's
really
no
difference.
i
mean,
ballot
issues
affect
the
electorate's
life
as
much
as
legislative
decisions
by
the
legislature.
thank
you.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
buckley.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
your
honor,
the
first
amendment
protects
speech,
but
it
doesn't
necessarily
say
that
the
state
can
never
regulate
anonymous
speech.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
your
honor,
i
think
that's
the
tornillo
case.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
i
think
that's
the
tornillo
case,
but
these
statutes,
that
sort
of
scenario
is
drastically
different.
we're
not
trying
to
control
the
content.
we're
not
trying
to
make
someone
say,
"i
have
my
position,
and
now
i'm
going
to
articulate
my
opponent's.
"
all
i'm
asking
for
is
that
you
identify
yourself
and
then
say
whatever
you
want.
if
margaret
mcintyre
had
observed
the
law
here,
she
never
would
have
found
herself
before
the
ohio
elections
commission.
it
was
not...
it
was
not
that
she
had
disclosed
her
identity,
it
was
her
failure
to
disclose
her
identity.
mr.
andrew
l.
sutter
your
honor,
but
it
does
go
to
this
whole
question
of
retaliation,
and
it
goes
to
this
whole
question
of
what
the
real
intrusion
was
as
far
as
first
amendment
speech
is
concerned.
thank
you.
