justice

scalia
mr.
sutter,
what's
the
pedigree
of
provisions
like
this?
i
gather
they
didn't
have
any
in
1787.
when's
the
first
one
that
you
know
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they
go
back
that
far.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sutter,
we're
entitled
to
assume,
aren't
we,
that
the
people
of
ohio
like
this
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
their
legislature
that
adopted
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
mean,
in
the
normal
course
of
events,
i
guess
most
people
in
ohio
like
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
presumably
would
rather
know
who
is
putting
out
these
pamphlets
than
not
know.
