what
is
the
underlying
theory
for
that?
that
describes
the
test.
it
describes
the
line,
but
what
is
the
theoretical
justification
for
drawing
the
line
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
the
prison
authorities
transferred
the
prisoner
to
solitary
confinement,
and
he
says,
there's
no
reason
for
doing
this,
and
they
said,
oh,
we've
heard
a
rumor
that
you're
a
troublemaker.
does
that
suffice?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i
mean
in
this
hypothetical
regime,
where
we
don't
have
procedural
due
process
protections
to
any
degree,
but
we
do
have
a
minimum
requirement
of
some
rationality,
would
the
case
that
i
put
fit
within
that
requirement
and
meet
that
requirement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
you
don't
have
a
rule.
the
rule
is
that
the
prison
authorities
can
do
what's
for
the
best
interests
of
the
prison,
of
prison
management.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
trying
to
follow
justice
souter's
point,
which
is
to
try
to
explore
whether
or
not
the
regime
we
would
be
substituting
is
really
much
of
an
improvement,
and
so
i
put
you
the
case
of
an
assignment
to
solitary
confinement
based
on
a
rumor
that
he's
a
troublemaker,
and
i
want
to
know
if
that
meets
the
minimum
small
core
of
rationality
that's
required
for
prison
officials
to
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i
take
it
that's
based
on
the
theory,
but
maybe
i'm
wrong,
that
the
government
must
always
have
some
reason
for
what
it
does?
i
don't
think
we've
ever
said
that,
but
that
would
be
the
underlying
theoretical
justification
for
this
principle,
that
the
government
must
always
have
some
minimum
rationality
for
whatever
action
it
takes.
now,
we've
never
said
that,
but
if
that's
what
you
want
us
to
say,
i
assume
that
would
be
the
reason.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
other
than
that,
it's
because
there
is
some
kind
of
liberty
interest,
as
justice
stevens'
question
points
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
the
supposition
that
justice
ginsburg
has
put
to
you,
where
you
have
a
state
that
says
in
the
sound
discretion
of
the
warden
you
can
be
put
in
solitary
confinement,
suppose
that
were
the
regime?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no
rules.
and
the
warden
said,
i
think
every
fifth
prisoner
should
know
what
it's
like
to
be
in
solitary,
and
i
put
you
all
in
solitary
for
the
first
2
months
of
your
confinements,
one
out
of
five.
is
that
within
the
sound
discretion
of
the
warden?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
sounds
to
me
like
it
might
well
be,
but
would
there
be
an
underlying
due
process
claim
that
you
could
bring
to
show
that
this
was
not
within
sound
discretion
as
that
term
is
generally
understood
under
the
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
it
seems
that
even
if
there's
a
sound
discretion
standard
there's
going
to
be
some
litigation
under
the
due
process
clause.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
interested
right
now
in
justice
ginsburg's
question,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
answer
to
her
question
there
is
nothing
left
for
you
to
complain
about
with
respect
to
a
due
process
violation
once
the
disciplinary
character
has
been
taken
away,
because
the
mere...
the
mere,
minor
increase
in
discomfort
would
not
in
and
of
itself
present
a
liberty
claim,
had
it
been
done
administratively.
