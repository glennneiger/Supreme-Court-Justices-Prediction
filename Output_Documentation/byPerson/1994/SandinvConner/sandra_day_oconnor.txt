mr.
michaels,
suppose
we
don't
adopt
your
proposed
new
rule,
do
you
think
that
application
of
existing
precedents
requires
affirmance
of
the
judgment
below
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
going
to
talk
about
that
at
all--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
concede
that
hawaii
has
created
here
a
state-created
liberty
interest
under
the
scheme
you
have
here,
under
our
existing
precedents?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
do
you
disagree?
is
it
because
it's
discretionary,
the
imposition
of
sanctions
under
the
hawaiian
scheme?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
they
won't.
maybe
they'll
repeal
them
if
every
case
involving
the
provision
of
a
sack
lunch
ends
up
as
a
due
process
violation.
i
mean,
is
there
no
line
that
can
be
drawn?
does
the
due
process
clause
get
invoked
when
the
prison
decides
somebody's
too
much
of
a
risk
to
have
a
tray
with
a
hot
lunch,
and
we're
going
to
give
them
a
sack
lunch?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there?
should
there
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
a
rule
dealing
with
not
allowing
prisoners
to
watch
violent
television
programs,
or
something
of
that
sort,
are
we
going
to
get
all
this
stuff
in
the
federal
courts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
counsel,
after
wolff
the
court
decided
a
case
called
vitek
v.
jones
in
1980,
and
this
is
what
was
said
in
that
opinion:
that
changes
in
the
conditions
of
confinement
having
a
substantial
adverse
impact
on
the
prisoner
are
not
alone
sufficient
to
invoke
the
protections
of
the
due
process
clause
as
long
as
the
conditions
or
degree
of
confinement
to
which
the
prisoner
is
subjected
is
within
the
sentence
imposed
on
him.
now,
that
language
sounds
to
me
like
it
would
go
a
long
way
toward
ruling
out
these
claims.
