bader

before
you
continue
with
that,
would
you
just
step
back
for
a
moment?
you
said
the
only
difference
was
the
loss
of
certain
privileges.
could
you
be
specific
about
what
it
was,
what
the
loss
consisted
of?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
michaels,
can
you
spell
out
your
equal
protection
theory,
because
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
it.
who
are
the...
what
are
the
groups
that
are
being
treated
dissimilarly?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
it
an
unusual
interpretation
of
the
word
"modify"?
that
formula
is
used
over
and
over
again
for
appellate
review.
an
appellate
court
can
affirm
or
modify
a
decision
below.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
think
that
you're
answering
the
question
that
i
asked.
i
thought
that...
you
say
"modify"
means
in
the
end
the
warden
can
do
whatever
the
warden
wants.
i
thought
that
that's
what
you...
your
interpretation
of
"modify".
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
word
is
constantly
used
to
describe
options
for
the
appellate
forum,
court,
and
it
doesn't
mean
that
a
court
of
appeals,
for
example,
can
do
whatever
it
wants
with
regard
to
a
district
court
decision
just
because
it
has
authority
to
affirm,
reverse,
or
modify.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hoffman,
suppose
the
state
had
a
rule
that
disciplinary
sanctions
are
within
the
sound
discretion
of
the
warden,
period.
would
you
have
a
due
process
claim,
and
what
would
be
its
nature?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
there
something
anomalous
about
saying
if
the
state
has
nothing
at
all...
here
are
two
people.
they're
both
in
prison.
one
is
told,
when
you
go
to
solitary
is
within
the
sound
discretion
of
the
warden,
and
the
other
is
told
that
you
have
these
procedural
rights,
and
the
one
who
has
no
rights
at
all
is
told,
too
bad
you
can't
complain.
there's
something
anomalous
about
that,
isn't
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
you
say
you...
in
answer
to
my
question
you
said,
somebody
could
be
treated
much
more
arbitrarily
and
has
no
rights,
if
the
state
doesn't
have
a
code
of
fair
prison
procedure.
the
fairer
the
state
is,
the
greater
the
right
of
the
individual.
there
is
something
anomalous
about
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
just
solitary,
because
you
made
a
distinction
between
administrative
segregation,
so
you
could
be
in
solitary
and
you
wouldn't
have
this
right,
but
one
thing
that
puzzles
me
about
this
particular
case,
the
1983
action
was
begun
at
an
interlocutory
stage.
the
warden
overturned
the
basic
punishment.
true,
it's
after
the
time
was
served,
but
there
is
no...
on
this
record
there
is
no
disciplinary
segregation.
so
it's
just
like...
in
this
particular
case
it's
just
like
it
had
been
an
administrative
segregation.
the
terms
are
virtually
the
same,
the
terms
of
incarceration,
so
why
should
we
treat
this
like
a
disciplinary
segregation
when
the
warden's
own
determination
has
in
effect
changed
its
character?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't
the
warden,
who
has
review
authority
and
did
review
this,
say
that
was
wrong?
the
discipline
is
out
of
it.
isn't
that
the
effect
of
the
warden's
decision
to
x
out
the
discipline
part
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
just
like
talking
about
a
district
court
decision
that's
been
vacated
by
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
there
be
a
damage
claim
for
someone,
let's
say,
who
is
incarcerated
pending
trial,
and
then
that
person
is...
it's
found
on
appeal
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient?
would
there
be
a
1983
claim
for
the
incarceration
in
the
interim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
is
this
different?
here
we
have
a
disciplinary
determination
by
the
original
board,
and
it's
overturned
by
the
warden.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
an
appeal
right
and
it
was
taken,
and
was
successful.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
there
something
like
a
failure
to...
the
1983
was
at
an
interlocutory
stage.
you
have
to
watch
the
entire
state
proceeding,
and
it
ends
up
with
the
disciplinary
sanction
expunged.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
fact
he
did
appeal,
and
in
fact
was
successful
on
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
didn't
suffer
the
punishment.
it's
the
collateral
consequences.
you
differentiated
administrative
and
disciplinary
because
of
the
collateral
consequences,
and
now
there
are
no
collateral
consequences.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hoffman,
there's
just
one...
you
said...
brought
up
the
patsy
case,
but
that's
going
outside
the
prison
setting.
suppose
a
guard
had
thrown
somebody
into
solitary
and
the
prison
code
said
you
can
go
to
a
disciplinary
committee
and
review
that,
and
the
prisoner
doesn't,
he
just
runs
right
into
federal
court
and
says,
the
guard
threw
me
into
solitary,
i
don't
have
to
exhaust
anything
under
the
prison
regime--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--isn't
part
of
the
due
process
that
you
can
go
to
the
warden...
it's
certainly
in
that
code
that
you're
relying
on
for
other
reasons
that
says
you
can
apply
to
the
warden
for
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wolff
didn't
present
this
situation
of
a
warden
having
overturned
the
denial
of
good
time
at
an
earlier
stage.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
suppose
that
had
happened
in
wolff.
suppose
the
tribunal
had
said,
we're
taking
away
your
good
time,
and
then
the
warden
reinstates
it.
certainly
there
would
be
no
due
process
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
a
bad
procedural
right.
i
mean,
if
you
take
it
in
the
wolff
context
the
warden,
after
the
1983
action
begins,
reviews
the
decision
and
says
it
was
wrong
to
remove
his
good
time.
he's
got
it
back,
so
he's
going
to
get
out
just
when
he
expected
to.
he
would
still
have
a
federal
claim
you
say
because
of
the
process?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
could...
you'd
have
your
claim,
you
could
get
declaratory
relief,
and
you
could
get,
what
is
it,
1
in
damages,
maybe.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
wouldn't...
but
the
claim,
you'd
still
have
the
claim,
on
your
reasoning,
right?
