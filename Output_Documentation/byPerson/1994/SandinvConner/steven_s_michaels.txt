mr.
steven
s.
michaels
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
to
this
court
from
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
holding
that
hawaii
administrative
rule
17-201-18(b),
our
burden-of-proof
rule,
creates
a
liberty
interest
entitling
every
inmate
in
the
hawaii
penal
system
to
a
procedural
due
process
review
under
the
standards
of
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
for
every
assignment
to
disciplinary
segregation
of
4
hours
or
more.
in
so
holding,
the
ninth
circuit
ignored
nearly
a
half-dozen
decisions
of
this
court
that
characterize
the
wolff
case
as
applying
solely
to
regimes
that
threaten
the
loss
of
good-time
credit.
the
state
of
hawaii
has
no
system
of
good-time
credit,
nor
does
even
our
parole
system
make
a
disciplinary
finding
a
necessary
impact
on
parole.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
it
is
relevant
in
the
sense
that
a
bad
disciplinary
record
can
be
but
need
not
be
a
basis
for
the
denial
of
parole.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
yes,
and
justice
souter,
i
would
say
that
the
driving
force
for
parole
decisions
today
in
our
state
would
be
prison
overcrowding.
that
would
be
another
reason
for
granting
early
parole.
but
it
has
no
necessary
impact,
and
inmates
who
have
very
good
records
in
prison
could
be
denied
parole
for
any
number
of
reasons,
and
inmates
that
have
very
bad
records
in
prison
could
be
granted
parole
for
a
number
of
reasons.
the
ninth
circuit
also
ignored
a
lengthy
summary
judgment
record
that
tells
us
what
demont
connor's
assignment
to
disciplinary
segregation
actually
meant
in
real-world
terms.
he
was
assigned,
before
he
was
assigned
in
disciplinary
segregation,
to
module
a,
and
module
a
was
the
most
restrictive
general
population
module
in
the
entire
hawaii
penal
system.
as
a
result,
his
assignment
to
disciplinary
segregation
meant
only
the
loss
of
certain
privileges,
and
was
not
a
major
change
in
the
conditions
of
his
confinement.
we
ask
the
court,
as
it
decides
this
case,
to
keep
five
things
in
mind.
first,
disciplinary
confinement
is
only
one
stopping
point
along
a
continuum
of
penalogical
responses,
and
is
merely
the
combination
of
one
set
of
privileges
in
lieu
of
another
and
we
submit
that,
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
federalize
through
the
due
process
clause
all
state-created
privileges
in
prison,
it
must
reverse
the
decision
of
the
ninth
circuit
below.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
right,
and
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
refer
your
honor
to
the
guidelines
that
begin
on
page
125
of
the
joint
appendix.
there
are
a
number
of
provisions,
and
i'm
prepared
to
discuss
those.
when
the
inmate
was
in
module
a,
he
was
subject
to
lock-down
already
for
16
hours
a
day.
when
he
went
to
disciplinary
confinement,
his
amount
of
lock-down
time
increased,
but
the
inmate
was
also
entitled
to
out-of-cell
exercise
time,
shower
five
times
a
week,
religious
counseling,
legal
counseling,
as
well
as
a
monthly
visit
with
his
family,
non-contact
visit.
the
number
of
visits
went
down.
it
would
have
gone
down
from
eight
to
one.
he
would
have
lost
the
one
telephone
call
that
he
could
make
of
a
personal
nature,
although
he
would
have
had
the
right
to
make
legal,
official
phone
calls
to
counsel
or
to
the
state
ombudsman.
in
addition,
the
inmate
would
have
lost,
when
he
moved
from
module
a,
the
right
to
watch
television
and
to
receive
certain
newspapers,
but
he
would
be
entitled
to
have
both
religious
and
nonreligious
reading
materials
in
the
disciplinary
holding
unit.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
justice
souter,
i
suppose
that
because
the
concept
of
de
minimis
does
exist
in
the
law,
that
one
could
have
that,
but
it
would
mean
that
a
very
large
number
of
privileges
that
from
a
subjective
sense
to
the
prisoner
would
not
be
viewed
as
de
minimis
would
be
eligible
for
procedural
due
process
protection.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
even
then,
in
an
objective
test,
i
would
think
the
category
of
de
minimis,
if
the
court
is
going
to
treat
it
as
it
has
been
treated
in
the
law,
would
mean
that
only
a
very
small
number
of
changes
would
be
exempt
from
federal
judicial
scrutiny.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
we
think
that
the
longstanding
theme
of
this
court's
decisions
dealing
with
prison
management,
that--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--it
would
be
better
than--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--we
don't
think
that
line
is
administrable,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
in
that
sense,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
yes.
our
position
is
that
the
line
for
eligibility
for
due
process
protection
should
be
drawn
at
good-time
credits,
or
a
finding
that
has
a
necessary
impact
on
a
parole
date.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
your
honor,
we
ask
the
court
in
this
case
to
look
at
the
structure
of
cases
such
as
wolff
v.
mcdonnell,
as
well
as
the
extensive
progeny
in
this
area.
the
underlying
theme
of
this
court's
decisions
is
that
prison
managers
need
flexibility
and
discretion,
and
to
the
extent
the
constitution
intrudes
upon
that
by
weighing
procedural
due
process
requirements
upon
them,
the
court
has
always
been
solicitous
of
categories
of
conduct
that
are
meaningfully
different
from
one
another.
for
example,
in
the
wolff
case
itself,
the
court
distinguished
between
parole
revocation,
where
the
person
is
already
out,
and
good-time
credits
where
the
person
is
in
but
has
earned
a
certain
expectation
of
getting
out
by
a
particular
day.
we
think
that
this
case
is
categorically
different
from
even
that
situation,
the
good-time
credit
case,
and
that
the
appropriate
constitutional
response
is
to
say
that
this
is
not
an
area...
even
where
for
management
reasons
we
may
have
mandatory
rules,
that
this
is
not
an
area,
justice
kennedy,
where
the
due
process
clause
should
be
the
constitutional
protection.
one
of
the
points
that
i
make,
and
i
make
it
now,
is
that
we
do
submit
that
there
will
still
be
backstop
constitutional
protection
against
arbitrary
assignments
to
disciplinary
segregation,
but
the
source
of
that
right
should
not
be
the
variegated
and
sometimes
complex
requirements
of
the
procedural
due
process
clause,
but
it
would
be
the
requirement
of
minimum
rationality
under
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
there
would
be
review
under
the
equal
protection
clause--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--for
minimum
rationality.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
several
answers,
your
honor.
first,
as
to
what
the
empirical
result
would
be
on
parole,
the
court
has
already
held
in
cases
like
the
dumschat
case,
i
believe,
that
that
empirical
evidence
is
not
relevant
to
the
procedural
due
process
question.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
our
rule
would
not
tolerate
it
if
this
was
a
charge
that
was
simply
made
up.
our
position
is
that--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--because,
as
even
this
court's
cases
recognize,
although
the
equal
protection
line
of
arguments,
the
rational
basis
test,
is
a
very
lenient
test,
it
is
not
a
toothless
test,
and
that,
for
example,
city
of
cleburne
v.
cleburne
living
center,
the
court
actually
will
require
some
evidence
to
show
that
there
is
a
rational
basis
for
the
assignment.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
our
position
is
that
there
would
be
only
a
minimal
evidence
requirement,
but
yes,
there
could
be
judicial
review,
so
that--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--i
believe
the...
in
my
discussion
with
you
that
we're
at
least
clarifying
our
brief.
i
think
that
the
brief
was
clear,
but
i'd
like
to
clarify
the
brief
in
that
regard.
because
of
the
way
the
equal
protection
works,
in
court
we
would
obviously
have
to
produce
some
evidence,
under
our
theory
to
justify
the
detention.
the
real-world
consequence,
though,
for
this
case
would
be
that
other
requirements
of
wolff
v.
mcdonnell,
such
as
the
contemporary
statement
of
evidence
and
the
particular
problem
we
had
with
the
ninth
circuit
in
this
case
dealing
with
whether
witnesses
could
be
called
or
not,
those
would
be
eliminated,
and
those
would
be
the
consequence
of
adopting
our
opening
argument
in
the
case.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
well,
the
court--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--well,
we
certainly
don't
want...
as
a
client
matter,
i'm
sure
that
my
client
would
be
thrilled
if
they
were
never
there
at
all.
i
think
in
terms
of
offering
the
court
one
way
to
solve
the
tensions
in
the
case--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--yes.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
i
can
understand
your
honor's
concern
that
as
a
general
matter,
when
reviewing
legislation,
the
court
will
use
the
imagined
rational
basis
standard,
but
even
cases
like...
but
in
cases
where
there
are
as-applied
equal
protection
challenges,
and
these
challenges
could
be
brought
now,
but
obviously
the
litigants
don't
do...
the
plaintiffs
don't
do
that,
because
they
have
a
howitzer
with
the
procedural
due
process
clause.
under
the
cleburne
case,
the
court
actually
required
in
an
as-applied
equal
protection
challenge
some
rational
connection
between
a
legitimate
interest
and
what
the
government
was
doing
in
that
case.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
well,
we
do
offer
that
as
the
support
for
what
the
constitutional
backstop
would
be
if
the
court
wanted
to
go
in
that
way.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
well,
it
would
be
a
minimal
test,
and
at
the
same
time,
your
honor,
we--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--i'd
respectfully
disagree,
justice
souter,
because
the
present
system
is
not
only
as
complicated
as
you
make
it,
but
even
much
more
so,
because
under
superintendent
v.
hill
we
do
have
to
provide
already
some
evidence,
and
so
we
already
would
have
to
meet
that
component
under
procedural
due
process
analysis.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
yes,
indeed,
because
there
are
at
least
several
other
aspects
of
procedural
due
process
protections,
namely
the
requirement
of
a
contemporary
statement,
and
there
are
all
kinds
of
conflicts
that
arise
as
to
what
has
to
go
in
the
statement,
how
specific
the
reference
has
to
be
to
the
evidence,
and
these
provoke
a
great
amount
of
litigation,
and
in
this
case
particularly,
the
issue
of
witnesses.
those
would
disappear
under
our
analysis.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
i
would
say
that
being
a
troublemaker
per
se
is
not
governed
by
the
specific
rules
that
we
have
in
our
institution.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
i
would
have
to
answer
that,
justice
kennedy,
yes
and
no.
yes,
if
in
the
rational
basis
analysis
one
would
be
going
outside
of
what...
the
specific
rules
the
prison
has
in
terms
of
defining
the
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
then
the
answer
would
be
yes.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
yes.
we
submit
that
that
would
suffice.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
it
would
be
whether
the
official
genuinely
believed
that
that
rumor
had
basis.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
justice
scalia,
the
court
could
certainly
decide
the
case
on
that
basis,
and
frankly
my
client
would
be
thrilled
if
it
did.
we
have
always,
in
our--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--what
we
offered--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--we
have
offered
to
the
court--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--we
would
like
that,
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
decide
it
in
that
manner
for
us
to
prevail.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
well,
our
position
is
that
the
equal
protection
clause
requires
a
rational
basis
for
the
decision
with
respect
to
a
legitimate
state
interest,
and
it
would
go
beyond,
your
honor,
the
type
of
suspect
class
analysis,
and
this
is
the
way
we
presented
it
in
both
the
cert
petition
and
in
our
brief.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
that
may
well
be--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--it
is
our
position
that,
even
in
as-applied
cases,
that
there
has
to
be
some
rational
basis.
litigants
could
bring
these
cases
now,
theoretically,
under
the
court's
decisions.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
no,
justice
o'connor,
we
do
not.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
yes.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
yes.
one
of
the
factors
that
this
court's
existing
precedents
have
focused
upon
is
whether
the
constitutional
rule
that's
been
proposed
by
a
litigant
would
be
bad
constitutional
policy.
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
basically
tells
the
states
that
we
could
eliminate
all
this
litigation
just
by
eliminating
our
rules.
in
response
to
the
concern
of
justice
stevens,
if
we
simply
wiped
out
our
rules
and
said
that
we
can
send
you
to
disciplinary
confinement
whenever
we
want,
we
would
not
have
this
case
before
the
court.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
because
it
would
not
get
us
exactly
where
we
want
to
go,
which
is
to
have
guidance
to
our
lower
level
officials.
it
is
important
for
us
as
prison
managers
to
have
rules
that
are
of
a
mandatory
nature,
and
to
have
those
be
instructions
to
our
lower
level.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
yes,
and
what
we
submit
is
that--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--our
position
is
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
doctrine
this
court's
decisions
in
hewitt
v.
helms
have
made
statements
that
the
court
should
be
sensitive
to
the
state's
incentives
in
this
area,
and--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--we
disagree
with
that,
justice
o'connor,
and
with...
and
i'll
address
that
now.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
it's
a
two-part
argument.
first,
we
believe
that
our
broader
ground
for
reversal
does
respond
to
existing
precedent,
because
we
believe
existing
precedent
asks
the
court
to
take
into
account
the
incentives
that
are
created.
but
secondly,
we
also
believe
that
the
assignment
is
sufficiently
discretionary
that
our
case
falls
within
the
kinds
of
language
in
cases
such
as
kentucky
v.
thompson
and
olim
v.
wakinekona,
and
i
focus
the
court
on
two
of
the
aspects
of
discretion.
first,
the
ninth
circuit
just
read
our
rule
incorrectly
in
saying
that
we
have
a
sufficiency,
a
substantial
evidence
requirement.
the
mandate
of
rule
17-201-18(b)
is
a
duty
to
convict
if
there
is
substantial
evidence
of
misconduct.
our
rule
says
that
there
must
be
more
than
mere
silence
in
order
to
send
a
person
to
disciplinary
confinement.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
we
respectfully
disagree
with
that
characterization.
the
purpose
of
the
rule
is
to
require
disciplinary
confinement
if
there
is
substantial
evidence,
but
we
can
give
disciplinary
confinement
if
there
is
less.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
not
explicitly.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
it's
our
position
that
the
way
the
rule
is
structured,
that
the
committee
can
convict
on
less.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
it
says
that
you
must
convict
on
substantial
evidence.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
right,
and--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--that's
one
possible
reading
of
the
rule.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
in
light
of
the
overall
purposes,
we
believe
that
it
is,
in
light
of
the
overall
purposes
of
the
regulation.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
i
can't
cite
any
to
the
court.
the
other
aspect
of
discretion
that
we
refer
the
court
to
is
the
authority
of
the
administrator
in
17-201-20(b)
to
modify
any
and
all
findings
of
the
hearing
committee,
and
this
is
without...
this
power
is
without
limitation.
it
is
there
so
that
the
warden
can
order
assignment
to
disciplinary
segregation
when
there's
been
an
acquittal
that
he
feels
is
unjust.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
it
does
vest--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--it
does...
it
vests
greater
discretion
in
the
warden
because
that
person
has...
is
at
the
top
of
the
system
and
hopefully
has
a
better
perspective
on
these
questions.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
justice
ginsburg,
our...
the
fact
that
our
rule
doesn't
track
all
of
the
options
that
are
available
in
the
federal
statute
governing
appellate
procedure
is,
in
our
judgment,
not
enough
to
say
that
that
discretion
is
not
just
as
unfettered
as
in
cases
such
as
olim
v.
wakinekona.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
yes,
that
is
our
interpretation.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
what
we
respond
to
that
concern
is
that
that
word
has
a
different
meaning
in
the
prison
context,
and
at
least
this
court's
decisions
have
given
prison
administrators
leeway
in
interpreting
their
rules,
and
if
one
looks
at
the
thompson
case
itself,
the
court
went
quite
far
in
defining
discretion
where,
frankly,
even
the
state
of
kentucky
did
not
believe
that
there
was
any.
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
no,
justice
stevens.
in
fact,
the
only--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--decision
in
this
area
by
the
supreme
court
of
hawaii
that
is
important,
or
that
has
even
touched
on
this,
is
state
v.
alvey.
state
v.
alvey
says
that
the
purpose
of
this
system
is
not
punishment,
it
is
to
regulate
the
good
order
of
the
institution.
for
that
reason
as
well,
and
for
other
reasons--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--there
has
been
an
instance
in
which
the--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--yes,
and
actually--
mr.
steven
s.
michaels
--i
don't
have
a
specific
cite,
because
our
administrative
decisions
are
not
reported,
but
i
can
represent
to
the
court
that
there
was
at
least
one
instance,
and
because
of
intimidation
at
the
hearing
committee
level
that
does
occur,
your
honor.
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
