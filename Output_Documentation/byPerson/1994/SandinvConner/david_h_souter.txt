justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
does
make
it
a
relevant
finding.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
they
could
say
this
person's
record
is
terrible,
he
clearly
is
not
a
good
candidate
for
a
trouble-free
life
if
released,
so
we're
not
going
to
parole,
or
they
could
say,
this
person's
record
is
terrible,
let's
get
him
out
of
here
as
soon
as
we
can.
they've
got
that
choice.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
a
third
alternative
for
us?
you
spoke
of
federalizing
everything,
of
limiting
interests
only
to
those
that
affect
prison
time,
and
so
on.
is
there
a
third
alternative
of
devising
some
kind
of
a
de
minimis
rule
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
presume
we'd
have
an
objective
de
minimis
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
wouldn't
be
worth
the
trouble,
from
your
standpoint,
to
have
a
de
minimis
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
it...
just
from
your
standpoint,
from
your
client's
standpoint,
would
it
be
worth
your
while
to
have
such
a
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
rather
have
all
or
nothing,
in
effect,
rather
than
have
a
de
minimis
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
may
i
interrupt
you?
you
say
it
would
be
a
minimal
test.
i
don't
see
why
it
wouldn't
be
a
much
more
complicated
test
than
the
one
that
you've
got
now,
because
the
issue
now
is
whether
certain
procedural
options
were
provided
to
the
prisoner.
that
seems
to
me
something
fairly
simple
to
litigate,
even
though
it
may
provoke
a
certain
degree
of
nuisance
litigation
for
you.
but
if,
in
fact,
a
minimal
sufficiency
of
evidence
criterion
is
going
to
take
its
place,
i
would
suppose
that
that
was
going
to
be
rather
more
complicated
to
litigate,
because
you're
going
to
have
to
establish
what
was
there
in
the...
before
the
parole...
before
the
prison
warden,
or
whatever
the
disciplinary
committee
is.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
asking
for
the
substitution
of
a
very
complicated
procedure
in
place
of
a
comparatively
simple
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
things
would
be
simpler
on
a
sufficiency
of...
minimal
sufficiency
of
evidence
test?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
asking
us
to,
or
aren't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
that
the
basis
upon
which
you
want
us
to
decide
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes
or
no?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
you
really
could
do
that,
why
don't
you
go
ahead
and
do
it?
that
way,
we
wouldn't
have
to
decide
a
new
body
of
law
and
you
and
your
client
would
get
exactly
where
you
want
to
go.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
doesn't
that
mean
simply
it's
like
an
administrative
fifth
amendment?
in
other
words,
you
can't
find
substantial
evidence
based
on
the
silence
of
the
prisoners.
isn't
that
all
that
means?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
ask
you
a
different
question.
your...
i
take
it
there's
nothing
in
your
rules
that
expressly
says,
in
the
absence
of
substantial
evidence
you
may
still
convict?
there's
nothing
that
says
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
say
it
explicitly
or
you
don't,
and
i
take
it
there's
nothing
that
says
that.
you
have
all
sorts
of
variations
about
punishment,
but
about
conviction,
there's
nothing
more
that
is
said.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
just
tell
me
how
the
rule
is
structured,
and
on
the
question
of
conviction,
as
i
understand,
you
say
two
things,
the
rule
says
two
things:
you
shall
convict
on
substantial
evidence;
silence
is
not
enough.
that's
all
it
says,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
must,
shall,
it's
mandatory,
but
that's
all
it
says,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
the
ninth
circuit
says,
if
it
says
you
shall
convict
on
substantial
evidence,
most
people
reading
that
would
say,
you
better
not
convict
if
you
don't
have
substantial
evidence.
is
that
an
unreasonable
reading
of
the
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
it
unreasonable?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
saying
that
the
essence
of
the
harm
is
its
disciplinary
character.
your...
i
understood
your
argument
to
be
that
if
this
had
been
imposed
purely
administratively
for
nondisciplinary
purposes
there
would
be
no
liberty
interest
and
no
due
process
claim,
so
once
the
disciplinary
character
has
been
expunged,
and
there
is
no...
presumably
no
chance
of
collateral
consequences,
e.g.
in
the
parole
decision,
then
what
do
you
have
left?
