justice
antonin
scalia
there's
a
lot
less
here
than
meets
the
eye.
you're
saying
all
of
this
litigation
should
continue,
but
it
should
be
just
a
different
standard...
minimal
evidence.
that's
all
you're...
i
thought
you
wanted
these
cases
out
of
the
federal
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
want
them
in
there
just
on
different
evidentiary
standards.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
a
way
to
win
the
case,
i
suppose,
but
i
just
don't
know
how
much
you're
winning.
it's
frankly
news
to
me
that
the
equal
protection
clause
is
an
evidentiary
guarantee.
do
you
have
any
cases
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what's
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
a
backstop.
i
think
you're
asking
us
to
jump
out
of
the
frying
pan
into
the
fire
and
create
a
whole
new
constitutional
equal
protection
jurisprudence
that
allows
all
sorts
of
factual
decisions
by
every
state
and
locality
to
be
reviewed
on
equal
protection
grounds.
that's
a
whole
new
territory.
i
mean,
maybe
hawaii
likes
it,
but
i
don't
view
it
as
a
great
assistance
to
the
problem
of
overintrusiveness
of
the
federal
government
into
these
matters.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could...
hawaii
could
adopt
all
of
those
that
it
wants.
we're
not
stopping
hawaii.
hawaii
can
have
all
the
codes
of
guidance
it
wants.
the
only
question
is
whether
all
of
these
things
are
going
to
be
enforceable
in
federal
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
them
to
be.
you
want
us
to...
you
can't
do
it
yourself,
you
think.
that's
hawaii's
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
a
weird
system.
they're
very
careful
to
make
this
finding,
and
then
they
say,
and
by
the
way,
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
warden
can
do
whatever
it
wants.
do
you
really
think
that's
what
it
means?
i
find
that
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
it
means
he
can,
you
know,
review
and
alter
the
findings
for
some
good
reason?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
outcome
in
hewitt?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
was
that
liberty
interest
violated?
was
the
finding--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
you
could
really
say,
it
really
didn't
matter
whether
they
was
a
liberty
interest
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
really
say
that
was
all
dictum,
in
fact,
couldn't
you?
you
could
say,
assuming
there
was
a
liberty
interest,
it
wasn't
violated
in
hewitt.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
that,
but
we
sometimes
do
that,
and
later
we
find
out
that
we
really
didn't
have
to
go
into
all
that
discussion,
because
you
know,
assuming
there
was
a
liberty
interest,
it
wasn't
violated.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
did
it
again
in
thompson,
didn't
we?
what
happened
in
thompson?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
result
in
thompson?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
who
won?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
didn't
win
again.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
didn't
win
again.
so
you
could
really
say
we
said
assuming
there
was
a
liberty
interest,
it
really
wasn't
violated
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
it
very...
i
don't
know,
i
think
it's
good
that
states
ought
to
adopt
rules,
just
as
i
think
it's
good
that
parents
ought
to
adopt
rules,
you
know,
for
their
wards.
if
you
come
in
later
than
12:00,
you
get
grounded,
and
then
the
kid
comes
in
late...
you
know,
a
little
earlier
than
12:00,
and
an
unreasonable
parent
says,
makes
a
wrong
decision
and
grounds
the
child.
that's
too
bad,
but
that's
not
going
to
cause
me
to
say
that
parents
shouldn't
make
rules,
or
that
courts
are
going
to
review
what
the
parents
do
about
it
all
the
time,
and
it
seems
to
me
a
sensible
system
for
prisons,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
ought
to
be
those
rules.
instead
of
hawaii
trying
to
run
away
from
them
and
misdescribe
them
as
really
not
saying
you
have
to
make
such
a
finding,
you
ought
to
have
to
make
a
finding,
but
that's
a
matter
for
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
hawaii
to
decide.
they
don't
want
to
yank
all
that
stuff
up
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
although
they
were
all
conditions
that
he
subjected
himself
to
by
committing
the
felony
he
committed.
justice
antonin
scalia
exactly,
and
we're
talking
about
how
many
should
be
lost.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
it
is,
but
where
is
it
writ
that
that
isn't
one
of
the
things
that
you
subject
yourself
to
when
you
commit
a
crime?
i
mean,
you
don't
subject
yourself
to
being
put
in
confinement
because
of
your
race
or
because
of
your
color
or
because
of
your
religion.
all
those
liberties
remain,
but
one
of
the
risks
you
take
when
you
get
sent
to
jail
is
unreasonable
and
arbitrary
masters.
i
mean,
that's
part
of
the
bad
part...
thing
about
being
sent
to
jail.
now,
why
isn't
that
acceptable?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
be
tortured,
you
can't
be
discriminated
against
for
all
those
liberty
reasons
that
are
set
forth
in
the
constitution,
but
doggone
it,
one
of
the
hard
things
about
going
to
jail
is
sometimes
you
get
a
bad
warden
just
like
sometime
children
have
unreasonable
parents.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
part
of
the
punishment.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
answer
is
that
it
was
not
done
administratively.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
cannot
retroactively
make
it
done
administratively.
when
it
was
done,
it
was
done
as
a
punishment.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
can
say
later
that
was
a
mistake,
but
in
fact
it
was
done
as
a
punishment.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
may
be
some
question
whether
you
can
recover
for
that
under
1983
or
not,
but
that's
not
a
standing
question,
it's
a
question
of
the
merits.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
why
wouldn't
it
suffice
if
we
held
for
those
matters
it's
a
denial
of
due
process
if
the
states
do
not
provide
state
court
review
of
the
prison
determinations?
