so
is
there
a
case
somewhere...
i
mean,
how
many
instances
have
there
been
in
which
prisoners
were,
in
fact,
punished
under
this
rule,
though
there
was
a
finding
there
was
not
even
substantial
evidence,
and
they
didn't
admit
guilt?
how
many
such
instances
have
there
been?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
is
there...
how
many
instances
have
there
been
in
which
the
administrator
overturned?
has
there
ever
been
an
instance
of
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
they
punished...
the
administrator
punished
a
person
for
the
high
misconduct,
even
though
the
board
had
found
no
substantial
evidence
and
he
didn't
concede
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
have
the
cite?
is
there--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
the
court
has
basically
done,
i
guess
in
this
area
as
in
property,
is
that
it's
said
that
one
way
of
looking
to
see
if
there's
a
liberty
or
property
interest
is
to
see
if
the
discretion
of
the
decisionmaker
to
remove
the
thing
from
the
person
is
significantly
confined
or
cabined
by
state
rules
or
regulations,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
sometimes
the
problem
is,
that
protects
things
that
seem
trivial,
and
sometimes
it
doesn't
protect
things
that
seem
important.
now,
have
you
a
better
way
than
that?
i
mean,
i
guess
the
main
argument
for
that,
particularly
in
the
trivial
area,
is
it's
hard
to
think
of
a
better
way,
and
do
you
have
a
suggestion,
if
this
is
being
written
for
something
that
would
in
a
better
way
distinguish
the
important
from
the
trivial
for
purposes
of
the
due
process
clause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
better
way,
really?
