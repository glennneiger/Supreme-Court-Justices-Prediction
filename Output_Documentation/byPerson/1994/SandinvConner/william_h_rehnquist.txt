chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-1911,
cinda
sandin
v.
demont
connor.
mr.
michaels.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
well,
what
you're
asking
for
is
a
form
of
de
minimis
rule,
except
it's
not
really
de
minimis.
you're
asking
for
a
rule
that
says
where
there's
no
loss
of
good-time
credit,
and
no
necessary
impact
on
parole,
then
you
would
not
construe
voluntarily
adopted
prison
regulations
as
creating
a
liberty
interest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
i
dare
say
that's
not
what
justice
souter
meant
about
a
de
minimis,
and
perhaps
you
wouldn't
describe
it
as
de
minimis,
but
you're
asking
for
some
sort
of
a
cut-off.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
a
good
reason
to
think
that
the
cleburne
case
was
something
of
a
sport,
in
view
of
our
subsequent
equal
protection
jurisprudence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
the
inquiry,
whether
the
person
was
in
fact
a
troublemaker,
or
whether
there
was
a
rumor
that
he
was
a
troublemaker?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
michaels.
mr.
hoffman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
understand
the
test
to
have
been
laid
down
in
hewitt?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
hewitt
certainly
doesn't
say
that
in
so
many
words.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
ends
up
being
something
of
an
ipse
dixit,
doesn't
it?
it
ends
up
talking
about
all
the
arguments
pro
and
con,
and
then
says,
on
these
peculiar
facts
we
find
there
was
a
liberty
interest?
do
you
think
that's
much
to
go
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
hewitt
we
said
it
didn't
didn't
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
could
be
important,
too,
if
the
court
adopts
some
sort
of
calculus
as
to
consequences
for
parole
and
that
sort
of
thing.
the
fact
that
he
served
the
30
days
can't
be
undone,
but
the
fact
that
it
may
be
treated
much
differently
for
parole
purposes
might
make
a
difference
in
whether
or
not
there's
a
state
liberty
interest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hoffman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
number
93-1911
sandin
against
conner.
in
this
case
prison
officials
alleged
that
respondent
conner
who
was
a
prisoner
in
hawaii
violated
prison
regulations
by
obstructing
a
physical
inspection.
after
a
disciplinary
hearing,
a
committee
punished
conner
with
30-days
in
disciplinary
segregation.
he
then
filed
a
suit
under
section
1983
claiming
that
prison
officials
deprived
him
of
procedural
due
process
because
they
didnâ€™t
allow
him
to
call
witnesses
at
this
disciplinary
hearing.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
ruled
in
favor
of
conner
but
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
we
reverse
that
decision.
procedural
due
process
claims
in
the
prison
context
have
been
analyzed
under
various
frameworks
since
this
court
decided
the
cases
of
wolff
against
mcdonnell
and
meachum
v.
fano
20
years
ago.
at
that
time,
the
court
defined
liberty
interest
by
inquiring
whether
the
deprivation
was
one
of
real
substance
and
whether
was
outside
the
normal
limits
or
range
of
custody
which
the
basic
judgment
of
conviction
authorized
the
state
to
impose.
later
the
court
shifted
focus
in
determining
whether
a
state
had
created
a
liberty
interest
directing
its
attention
to
other
prison
regulations
contained,
mandatory
language
and
substantive
predicates.
we
now
think
this
approach
was
flawed,
it
encourages
prisoners
to
comb
regulations
in
search
of
mandatory
language,
it
creates
disincentives
for
a
states
to
codify
prison
management
procedures
and
it
involves
federal
courts
in
the
day-to-day
management
of
prisons.
so,
in
this
case
we
return
to
the
principles
established
in
wolff
and
meachum
states
may
under
certain
circumstance
create
liberty
interests
which
are
protected
by
the
due
process
clause
but
they
are
limited
to
freedom
from
restraint
which
would
impose
atypical
and
significant
hardship
on
the
inmate
in
relation
to
the
ordinary
incidents
of
prison
life.
the
punishment
imposed
on
conner
does
not
depart
from
the
basic
conditions
of
his
sentence
nor
effect
the
duration
of
his
sentence
in
any
but
a
highly
speculative
way.
justice
ginsberg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
stevens
joins;
justice
breyer
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
souter
joins.
