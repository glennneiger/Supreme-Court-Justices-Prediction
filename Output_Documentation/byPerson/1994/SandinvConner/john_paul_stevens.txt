justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
to
test
your
position
on
equal
protection,
or,
i
suppose,
the
eighth
amendment,
too.
supposing
that
there's
no
necessary
consequence
of
impact
on
parole
on
a
particular
decision,
but
your
opponent
could
prove
that
99
percent
of
the
time,
people
who
received
a
particular
kind
of
punishment
were
denied
parole
for
an
extra
year,
and
also
that
the...
whenever
they
got
this
particular
punishment,
they
were
put
in
isolation
for,
say,
8
months,
not
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
but
a
dramatically
different
situation.
under
your
rule,
i
would
suppose
there's
simply
no
review
of
the
procedures
that
would
precede
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i'm
assuming
no--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no
racial
charge,
nothing
like
that,
just
the
person
who
made
the
decision,
the
argument
would
be,
he
acted
arbitrarily
because
the
crime...
i
mean,
the
offense
was
not
nearly
so...
you
know,
whatever
the
reason
might
be,
but
you
have
to
assume
total
discretion
on
the
warden
to
use
the
kind
of
punishment
i
suggest,
even
if
99
percent
of
the
time,
in
fact,
it
would
mean
an
extra
year
in
prison.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
may
be
right
as
a
matter...
all
i'm
asking
you,
am
i
not
correctly
describing
the
situation
that
your
rule
would
tolerate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
would
be
judicial
review
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence,
under
your
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
would
be
a
procedural
requirement
in
my
case,
of
minimum
evidence?
that's
not
the
position
i
understood
your
brief
to
advocate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
is
that?
if
your
position
is
that
there
is
no
liberty
interest
at
all,
why
does
he
even
need
to
believe
there's
a
rumor?
why
doesn't
he
just
say,
i
think
i'll
stick
this
guy
in
solitary
for
6
months?
it
seems
to
me
that
was
the
position
you
were
advocating.
that's
what
i
thought.
there's
no
liberty
interest
here,
so
why
should
there
be
any
procedural
protection?
we
think
he'd
be
better
off
over
on...
put
him
over
on
molokai
with
the
lepers,
and
that's
okay.
[laughter]
i
thought
you
were
saying--
--that's
what
i
thought
your
position
was.
--mr.
michaels,
that
essentially
when
you
commit
a
crime
and
get
placed
in
prison
you
become
a
ward
of
the
state,
and
one
of
the
punishments
of
being
a
ward,
one
of
the
bad
things
of
being
a
ward
is
that
you're
subject
to
sometimes
erroneous
and
even
arbitrary
decisions,
just
as
a
juvenile
is
when
a
father
says,
go
up
to
your
room,
for
something
she
didn't
do.
that's
why
it's
the
pits
to
be
a
ward,
and
it's
one
of
the
punishments
that
you're
subjected
to
when
you
commit
a
crime.
i
thought
that
was
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
i
understand
your
interpretation
in
your
brief,
but
has
that
interpretation
been
put
forward
in
any
judicial
decision,
or
any
interpretive
bulletin,
or
anything
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
plain
language--
