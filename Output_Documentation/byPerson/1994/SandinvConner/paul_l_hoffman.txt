mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
had
thought
this
case
was
about
the
state
of
hawaii's
desire
to
be
able
to
impose
arbitrary
punishment
in
the
absence
of
wolff
procedures.
we
have
three
main
arguments
in
response
to
the
state's
position.
the
first
really
is
that
the
case
is
quite
a
simple
case
under
this
court's
precedents,
that
under
wolff
and
hewitt
it
seems
clear
that
these
regulations
create
a
liberty
interest
because
they
require
that
there
be
a
finding
of
guilt,
a
finding
of
misconduct
before
punishment
can
be
imposed,
and
that
starts
from
the
very
beginning
of
the
regulations
in
17-201-4,
that
says
that
these
whole
regulations
are
about
tailoring
punishment
for
misconduct.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
your
honor,
the
test
that...
as
i
understand
it
in
hewitt,
is
that
the
state
has
to
restrict
administrative
discretion
in
a
way
that
would
give
a
prisoner
in
these
circumstances
a
legitimate
expectation
that
the
state
is
not
going
to
act
unless
certain
specific,
substantive
predicates--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--what
hewitt
talks
about
is
whether
there
are
substantive
predicates
that
are
laid
out,
and
particular
standards
that
control
administrative
discretion.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
think
it
says
more
than
that.
the
court
said
that
the
substantive
predicates
were
the
need
for
control
in
those
regulations
and
threat
to
security,
and
that
unless
there
were
findings
along
those
lines,
then
administrative
segregation
in
hewitt
could
not
be
imposed,
and
that
the
pennsylvania
statute
said
that,
and
that
if
the
pennsylvania
statute
had
said
that
administrators
could
impose
administrative
segregation
for
any
reason,
or
if
it
left...
as
in
thompson,
if
it
left
the
ultimate
decision
to
the
administrator,
free
from
a
substantive
predicate
that
had
to
be
met,
then
there
was
the
kind
of
discretion
that
would
not
create
a
liberty
interest
under
this
court's
doctrine.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
in
hewitt,
there
was
a
unanimous
court's
finding
that
there
was
liberty
interest
created
in
those
administrative
segregation
regulations.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
in
that
case
the
prisoner
lost,
because
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
think
it
matters--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
the
court
engaged
in
extensive
analysis.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
but
in
thompson,
after
hewitt,
and
in
other
cases
that
this
court
has
decided--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
think
that
it
would
be
difficult,
given
the
line
of
cases--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
in
thompson
the
court
went
through
the
same
analysis
that--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--the
prisoner
did
not
win--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--in
thompson.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
no.
in
thompson
the
court
did
not
find
a
liberty
interest
because
it
found,
after
reviewing
the
regulations,
that
there
was
ultimate
discretion
left
in
the
prison
administration--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--justice
scalia--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--as
a
matter
of
empirical
fact,
all
states
that
we
can
find,
based
on
the
regulations
cited
by
petitioner,
have
adopted
wolff,
more
or
less,
and
in
fact
there
are
regulations
that
are
very
similar
to--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
think
that
that
raises
the
question
that
was
asked
before
about
whether
there's
some
de
minimis
exception
with
respect
to
the
creation
of
state-created
liberty
interests,
or--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
have
two
answers,
really.
one
is,
i'm
not
sure
whether
there
should
be
under
the
jurisprudence
of
the
court
that
says
that
it's
the
weight...
the
nature
of
the
interest
rather
than
the
weight.
it's
hawaii's
decision
to
decide
what's
important
enough
to
handle
their
prison
in
this
way,
because
there
clearly--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--justice
o'connor,
what
i'd
say
to
that
is
it
probably
is
the
case
that
a
de
minimis
line
could
be
created.
i
believe
that
in
this
case
we
would
not
be
covered
by
that
kind
of
position.
i
think
from
this
court's
footnote
19
in
wolff
v.
mcdonnell,
this
court's
recognized
that
putting
someone
into
solitary
confinement
is
a
significant
thing,
and
i
would
take
issue
a
bit
with
mr.
michaels'
description
of
what
happens.
i
mean,
it
is
true
that
module...
that
the
module
in
which
mr.
connor
was
housed
before
was
more
restrictive
than
some
other
housing
units,
but
in
fact
he
lost
the
ability
to
work,
he
lost
educational
opportunities,
he
was
put
in
lock-down
more.
there
was
a
significant
change
in
conditions
because
of
an
act
of
misconduct
as
to
which
there
should
be
fair
procedures
to
decide,
so
i
think--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
if
the...
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
over
the
years
that
a
person
does
not
lose
all
of
his
or
her
constitutional
rights
by
being
in
prison,
and--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--and
it
could
be...
it
could
be,
as
this
court
said
in
hewitt,
that
for
reasons
of
institutional
management
or
security,
that
administrative
segregation
conditions,
which
may
even
look
a
lot
like
disciplinary
segregation,
can
be
imposed
without
this
kind
of
scrutiny
under
the
due
process
clause,
if
that's
how
the
regulations
are
drafted.
but
i
think
there's
a
significant
distinction,
and
this
court's
cases,
i
believe,
have
recognized
that.
even
in
hewitt,
the
court
distinguished
between
disciplinary
punishment
and
administrative
reasons,
that
there's
a
difference
when
the
state
seeks
to
impose
additional
punishment
on
someone
because
of
the
specific
thing
that
they
did.
that's
not
part
of
the
bargain
of
being
in
prison.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
we
would
not,
i
believe,
have
a
due
process
claim
based
on
a
state-created
liberty
interest.
in
other
words,
i
think
the
state
would
be
able
to
do
that,
but
i
think--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
think
the
way
that
i
would
resolve
the
anomaly
is
to
say
that
this
court
would
then
be
confronted
with
the
question,
or
courts
would
be
confronted
with
the
question
of
whether
the
due
process
clause
itself
provides
protection
against
that
form
of
arbitrary
punishment.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
i
don't
think
so,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
in
hewitt
the
court
said
that
administrative
segregation
was
the
kind
of
event
that
was
in
the
normal
range
or
limits
of
confinement,
and
this
court
at
the
same
time
it
was
saying
that,
in
fact
i
believe
in
either
the
next
or
the
prior
paragraph,
said
that
disciplinary
punishment
was
different,
and
that
there's
a
big
difference
between
subjecting
someone
to
a
particular
classification
or
to
administrative
segregation
within
a
prison
environment
and
putting
them
into
adverse
conditions
because
they've
done
something
wrong,
arguably,
and
this
court
has
recognized
in
many
contexts
that
punishment
is
different
from
measures
that
would
be
taken
for
a
regulatory
purpose.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
i
think
that
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
think
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
many
statements
that
this
court
has
made
that
there's
no
iron
curtain
between
the
constitution
and
prisoners,
because
if
the
due
process
clause
means
anything,
i
think
the
touchstone
is
protection
of
the
individual
against
arbitrary
government
conduct.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
think
under
this
court's
state-created
liberty
interest
doctrine,
one
of
the
thing
that
the
due
process
clause
protects,
in
addition
to
whatever
it
protects
apart
from
what
the
state
provides,
is
that
when
the
state
provides
something
that
a
person
can
reasonably
rely
on
as
an
entitlement,
that
this
court
protects
that
entitlement
by
fair
procedures,
and
in
this--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--yes.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
think
that
if--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
believe
that
this
court
left
open
in
hewitt
the
question
about
whether
there
could
be
due
process
claims
for
that
kind
of
arbitrary
decision.
i'm
not
sure
about
that
hypothetical.
i
think
if
it
was
done
to
punish
someone,
i
believe
it
would
be
different,
and
that
one
of
the
reasons
it
would
be
different
is
that
the
consequences
of
punishment,
as
this
court
also
recognized
in
hewitt...
in
hewitt,
the
court
distinguished
between
administrative
segregation
and
disciplinary
segregation
in
part
because
it
found
that
the
administrative
segregation
had
no
impact
on
parole,
likely
or
otherwise.
in
hawaii,
and
i
believe
it's
true
in
many
states,
if
there's
a
finding
of
misconduct
that
accompanies
the
decision
to
put
someone
in
solitary
confinement,
that
has
an
additional
impact
beyond
the
physical
change
in
conditions
of
confinement,
which
i
believe
is
where
your
question
is
coming
from.
if
there's
a
decision
made
for
other
institutional
interests
that
doesn't
focus
on
a
particular
person
that
says
one
in
five,
or
you
start
out
your
confinement
in
solitary
confinement
to
see
what
it
would
be
like
if
you
break
the
rules,
that
was...
that
presents
a
different
question,
i
think.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
that
if,
in
fact,
states
gave
unlimited
discretion...
in
fact,
if
we
went
back
to
the
days
of
the
hands-off
rule
before
wolff
started,
what
would
happen
is,
there
would
be
a
new
generation
of
litigation
about
what
the
due
process
required
in
a
variety
of
situations
and
i
believe,
and
certainly
i
would
be
urging,
that
what
the
ultimate
result
of
that
would
be,
is
something
that
looked
a
lot
like
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
and,
in
fact,
i
think
wolff
v.
mcdonnell
layes
out
a
set
of
procedures
that
are
well
understood
in
the
prisons
of
this
country
that
are
applied
every
day
in
hundreds
of
different
situations,
that
are
accepted,
and
about
which
there's
not
a
lot
of
controversy,
and
they
are
very
deferential
to
the
states.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
but
this
court
also
said
in
wolff
that
solitary
confinement
should
be
treated
in
the
same
manner,
and
i
think
that...
and
in
this
court
in
wright
v.
enomoto
summarily
affirmed
a
case
in
which
the
issue
of
disciplinary
segregation
that
was
the
only
one
that
was
involved.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
warden's
decision
changed
the
character.
what
happened
in
terms
of
the
procedure
in
the
case
was
that
this
was
a
disciplinary
punishment
of
30
days
that
was
made
after
the
adjustment
committee
made
its
decision
and
found
him
guilty
of
misconduct
under
the
rules.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
what
happened
is
that
after
mr.
connor
filed
a
section
1983
claim
in
federal
district
court
in
march
of
1988,
the...
deputy
administrator
pikini
expunged
as
part
of
the
administrative
review
the
30-day
sentence
involved
in
the
case,
in
may
of
1988.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
what
is
still
at
issue,
although
not
in
the
questions
presented,
is
whether
there
is
any
damage
claim
relating...
for
the
wrongful
30-days
in
disciplinary
punishment.
that's
what
the
remaining
claim
is...
when
it...
if--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--not,
i
believe,
on
those
facts.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
believe
what...
the
problem
is
that
he
served
the
time,
and
he
served
the
time
because
the
state
violated
its
due
process
obligations
under
the
law.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
but
he
still
suffered
the
harm,
and
the
harm...
i
mean,
i
think
he
would
have
to
show,
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
it
goes
back
down,
that
the
harm
was
caused
by
that
failure
to
afford
him
with
due
process,
and
his--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
but
i
think
that
that...
the
question,
as
i
understood
it,
presented
in
the
case
was
whether
there
was
a
liberty
interest
created
by
these
regulations
so
that
he
would
get
those
benefits.
i
think--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
it's
not...
first
of
all,
it's
not
clear
that
it
would
have
been
done
administratively.
he
was
in
the
general
population.
he
was
working.
he
had
a
life
within
the
prison
of
a
certain
kind.
there's
no
basis
in
the
record
to
believe
that
he
would
have
been
subjected
to
administrative
segregation.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
it
wasn't.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
that's
that.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
right.
i
mean,
our
position
is
that
is
what
it
was
done
for.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
that's
our
position.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
think
that
that's
true,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
i
think
that
one
of
the
problems,
if
i
may
just
address
the
bright
line
proposal
that--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
think
that...
as
i
understand
it,
after
patsy
at
least,
there's
no
requirement
to
have
exhausted
the
remedy
to
begin
with,
and
that
the
section
1983
action
would
not
be
changed
simply
because
there
was
this
particular
action
that
was
taken
after
the
section
1983--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--he
was
successful
on
that
one
issue,
but
he
still
served
the
time
and
suffered
the
punishment
for
no
good
reason,
because
from
his
standpoint
he
had
a
staff--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
there
are
no
collateral
consequences
at
this
point,
given
what
the
administrator
did
with
respect
to
this
finding
of
misconduct,
but
what
i
would
urge
is
that
with
respect
to
deciding
what
process
is
due,
one
can't
know
that
in
advance.
i
mean
when
a
prisoner
is
subjected
to
the
potential
of
a
misconduct
finding,
that's
when
a
decision
has
to
be
made
about
what
process
is
due.
he...
as
in...
if
the
case...
if
he
had
not
had
this
punishment
expunged,
then
it
would
have
been
possible
to
consider
it
for
parole.
i
would
also
say,
in
terms
of
the
bright
line
rule,
that
i
would
certainly
not
concede
for
a
minute
that
what
happens
in
disciplinary
punishment
within
hawaii
and
within
many
states
is
not
sufficiently
important
to
fall
within
whatever
bright
line
exists,
and
in
wolff,
for
example,
this
court
had
passages
that
said
that
the
fact
that
you
could
lose
good
time
didn't
have
the
necessary
effect
on
the
duration
of
your
sentence.
you
might
get
the
good
time
back,
it
might
not
affect
your
parole.
the
fact
of
being
put
in
solitary
confinement
was
viewed
to
be
a
fact
of
real
substance,
and
i
think
within
the
context,
if
the
issue
is
what
kinds
of
rules
can--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
but
i
don't
think
he...
at
that
point,
he
had
not
even
tried
to
take
advantage
of
the
due
process
that
was
afforded...
he
wouldn't
have
a
violation
at
that
point,
because
it's
there.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
but
wolff
says
that
you
also
get
a
chance
to
call
witnesses
to
prove
your
point,
and
so
the
due
process
violation
that
he's
claiming
is
not
that
he
didn't
get
something
else
that
he
could
have
gotten,
but
that
he
didn't
get
one
thing
that
was
central
to
his
point,
which
was
to
try
to
prove
that
he
didn't
do
what
they
said
he
did,
and
one
of
the
things
that
wolff
does
is
say
that
unless
there
is
some
higher
institutional
interest
in
terms
of
institutional
security,
you
get
a
right
to
call
that
witness
in
order
to
be
able
to
prove
your
case.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
think
that
there
would
still
be
a
due
process
claim
about
whether
you
receive
due
process
at
the
time.
i
mean,
one
of
the
problems
about
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
is
that
it's
not
clear
how
mr.
connor
would
know
whether
in
fact
there
was
ever
going
to
be
any
action
on
this
claim.
the
events...
this
hearing
was
in
august
of
1987.
he
filed
this
case
in
march
of
1988.
the
administrator's
decision
was
in
may
of
1988.
it
was
not
clear
at
the
point
he
filed
this
case
that
there
was
ever
going
to
be
any
action,
and
in
fact
he
had
served
his
entire
time
by
that
time,
and
so
if
it
was
wrongful
for
him
to
have
done
that
because
he
had
suffered
a
due
process
violation,
then
i
think
he
still
has--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
think
that
in
truth
the
amount
of
damages
that
you
suffer
in
a
case
like
that
if
you're
not,
for
example,
put
into
solitary
confinement
but
you've
lost
good
time
alone
would
be
very
hard
to
establish
very
many
damages,
but
i
think
at
least
theoretically,
if
you've
been
denied
the
process
due--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--i
mean,
you
might
get
nominal
damages,
you
might
not
get
nominal
damages.
i
mean,
i
think
that
the--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--well,
i
think
that
the
claim,
if
there's
a
state-created
liberty
interest,
or
a
liberty
interest
under
the
due
process
clause,
you
would
have
a
claim
if
the
proper
procedures
are
denied
you,
yes.
we...
that
would
be
our
position,
that
you
do
have
that
claim.
if
i
may
on
the,
just
to
address
the
particular
bright
line
that
hawaii
has
set
forth,
the
line
in
this
court's
cases
has
not
really
been
about
duration
of
confinement.
i
mean,
they've
tried...
this
court
has
tried
to
talk
about
things
that
are,
i
believe,
things
of
real
substance,
including
administrative
segregation.
where
a
state
actually
creates
rules
that
limit
the
imposition
of
administrative
segregation
like
hewitt,
this
court
has
found
that
that
is
certainly
an
important
enough
matter
that
the
state
can
be
held
to
its
word,
and
it
is
an
important
matter
and
it
may
be
that
in
some
circumstances
administrative
segregation
would
also
raise
constitutional
questions,
but
the
line
about
duration
of
confinement
would
first
of
all
not
be
a
bright
line,
because
in
this
case
we
should
fall
within
it.
his
duration
of
confinement,
at
least
from
the
standpoint
of
what
the
potential
punishment
is,
clearly
makes
this
an
important
decision
that's
going
to
be
made
about
misconduct,
and
there
are
many
different
interests
in
a
prison
about
which
prison
authorities
could
create
regulations
that
might
or
might
not
create
a
liberty
interest,
and
i
think--
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
--yes.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
draw
the
line.
i
mean,
i've
actually
thought
a
lot
about
how
you
would
draw
that
line.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
there
is
abetter
way
to
draw
the
line.
i
think
that
one
of
the
advantages
of
the
court's
doctrine
in
the
absence
of
the
better
way
is
that
it
essentially
leaves
it
up
to
the
states
to
make
a
certain
decision.
for
example,
in
almost
every
state
regulation
that
we
looked
at,
if
there's
minor
punishment,
relatively
minor
punishment,
the
procedures
of
wolff
are
not
applied.
i
mean,
it's
much
more
summary
procedures
that
look
a
lot
more
like
hewitt,
and
it
appears
that
there's
not
a
lot
of
complaint
about
that,
and
so
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
significant
punishment.
it's
significant
both
under
this
court's
cases,
but
also
in
hawaii.
hawaii
considers
this
to
be
an
important
punishment.
mr.
paul
l.
hoffman
well,
i
think
that
this
court's
cases,
certainly
the
perat
line
of
cases
seem
to
indicate
that
when
there's
random
and
unauthorized
state
action,
that
post
deprivation
remedies
would
be
appropriate,
but
i
think
that
in
a
case
where
there's
an
established
procedure
like
this
one,
that's
been
in
existence
for
more
than
20
years,
that
the
issue
is
really
what
process
is
due
as
part
of
this
determination,
not
at
some
later
point
in
a
state
court
hearing
on
damages.
