mr.
thomas
m.
christ
mr.
chief
justice,
no,
you're
not.
it's
mr.
christ.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
thank
you,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
my
opponents
have
just
offered
you
two
justifications
for
this
highly
intrusive
search.
one
is
maintaining
order
in
the
classroom,
and
the
other
is
promoting
athletic
safety,
and
i'd
like
to
address
each
in
turn.
first,
order
in
the
classroom.
if
that's
the
goal,
then
it
seems
to
me
that
this
test
is
completely
unnecessary.
you
don't
need
urine
testing
to
detect,
punish,
and
by
punishing
deter
disorderly
behavior.
disorderly
behavior
is
obvious.
disruptive
students
give
themselves
away.
urine
testing
isn't
going
to
aid
in
detecting.
now,
it
may
help
in
explaining
why
disorderly
students
are
that
way,
but
you
don't
need
to
know
that
in
order
to
detect
this
problem
and
deter
it
through
appropriate
punishment.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
it
depends
on
the
misbehavior,
but
i
think
if
there
is
sufficiently
disruptive
behavior
to
justify
their
conclusion
now
that
these
misbehaving
students
were
all
on
drugs,
that
would
perhaps,
under
t.l.o.,
present
individualized
suspicion
to
test
that
student.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
well,
the
problem
with
the
random
selection
is
that
you
are
subjecting
every
student,
including
those
who
are
not
disorderly,
not
misbehaving,
to
this
intrusive
degrading
experience,
and
that's
the
problem,
on
the
one
side,
to
be
balanced
against
this
risk
that
maybe
the
school
district
would
pick
out
certain
students.
it
would
not
apply
the
individualized
suspicion
standard
appropriately,
and
i
have
no
reason--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--no,
i
don't
think...
there
wasn't
in
t.l.o.
a
requirement
of
a
hearing
before
the
school
officials
looked
into
the
student's
purse.
they
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
suspect
that
the
student
was
violating
school
rules,
and
so
they
conducted
a
search.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
well,
i
think
the
intrusion
here
is
less
if
you
pick
out
the
few
students
who
are
disbehaving
and
disorderly,
and
subject
them
to
testing
as
opposed
to
take
every
student,
including
those
who
are
well-behaved
and
simply
want
to
play
school
sports--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--well,
my
first
point
is,
if
you
want
to
deter
disorderly
conduct,
you
just
see
it
and
you
punish
it
appropriately.
you
don't
need
to
go
beyond
that
and
say,
are
drugs
the
cause,
in
order
to
have
any
deterrent
effect.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
well,
if
you
are
disrupting
class,
then
you
have
justified,
perhaps,
school
officials
in
taking
you
out
and
subjecting
you
to
a
test.
that
is
less
intrusive
than
to
take
everybody
who
is
well-behaved
and
subjecting
all
of
them
to
the
test.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
no,
it
is
every
student
athlete,
every
athlete
who
tries
out
for
sports.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
initial
test--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--thereafter
they're
testing
10
percent
of
each
student
each
week,
so
that
during
the
course
of
the
season
you're
eventually
probably
going
to
get
to
everybody.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
i
don't
want
to
turn
them
into
policemen,
your
honor,
but
there
is...
the
relationship
is,
at
times,
adversarial.
as
you
pointed
out
in
t.l.o.,
they're
there
to
educate
but
first
they
also
have
to
maintain
order
and
discipline,
and
students...
teachers
are
disciplinarians
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
your
honor,
i
don't
want
to
misstate
my
position
here.
i
am
not
contending
for
urine
testing
on
individualized
suspicion.
i'm
not
conceding
that
that
would
be
constitutional.
i
am
submitting
to
you
that
that
would
be
less
intrusive
than
the
present
program
of
random
testing.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
i
think
you
should
find
that
any
urine
testing
is
unconstitutional
on
the
justifications
that
are
given
to
you,
but
if
they
cannot
prevent
random
testing
of
everyone,
including
my
client,
who
is
well-behaved
and
simply
wants
to
play
sports,
then
i'm
suggesting
that
short
of
that
you
should
have
testing
for
those
who
are
not
well-behaved,
and
who
are
disorderly,
and
who
are
disrupting
classes.
then
they
should
be
the
ones...
if
the
school
district
needs
to
find
out
why
these
students
are
misbehaving,
and
i
don't
think
they
need
to
know
that
in
order
to
punish
the
behavior
and
thus
deter
it,
but
if
they
do
need
to
know
that,
then
they
should
subject
the
disorderly
students
to
urine
testing,
not
every--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--sure.
drugs
are
harmful
to
the
users.
there
are
other
deleterious
consequences
to
drug
use,
but
the
justification
that
the
school
district
has
put
forth
throughout
these
proceedings
is
that
we
have
students
who
are
disorderly,
and
we
need
to
find
an
effective
means
of
deterring
that
behavior.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
no,
we
don't
believe
that's
sufficient.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
well,
i
don't
know
that
the
school
district
can
compel
anyone
to
submit
to
an
examination
for
those
purposes,
but
under
the
safety
standard
that
you
set
in
skinner
and
von
raab--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--i'm
not
contending
that
the
school
district
does
not--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--that's
not
my
position.
i
don't
need
to
take
that
here.
i
am
contending
that
the
risk
of
injury
from
a
student
using
drugs
in
sports,
in
athletics,
is
not
sufficiently
compelling
to
justify
so
intrusive
an
invasion
of
privacy
as
urine
testing.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
true,
and
my
client
took
a
physical
exam
here,
too,
which
was
required
here,
but
the
circumstances
of
that
examination
indicate
the
privacy
that
attaches
to
the
passing
of
urine.
he
took
the
examination
in
the
privacy
of
his
doctor's
office.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
the
point...
it's
substantially
different.
there's
a
substantial
difference
between
using
a
public
facility
and
being
singled
out
and
compelled
to
produce
urine
while
somebody
monitors
and
observes
the
production
of
the
sample,
and
then
surrender
the
sample
to
the
government
so
it
can
be
chemically
analyzed
for
whatever
secrets
are
contained
therein.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
it
would
make--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--no,
it
would
not
save
it,
but
it
would
make
it
less
intrusive,
and
that
was
one
of
the
procedural
safeguards
that
you
identified
in
skinner
and
von
raab
as
necessary
to
reduce
the
intrusiveness
of
urine
testing
to
a
constitutional
permissible
level.
independent
monitors,
independent
test
sites,
no
direct
observation
of
the
sample
being
produced,
advance
notice--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
i
don't
think
anything
is
enough
to
justify
urine
testing
of
students
for
the
purposes
that
have
been
advanced
by
my
opponents.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
well,
that's
the
position
i'm
taking
is,
if
they
cannot--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--my
fallback
position
is,
if
they
are
justified
in
urine
testing,
in
implementing
a
program,
they
are
not
justified
in
implementing
this
program
because
it
lacks
the
procedural
safeguards
you
identified
in
skinner
and
von
raab.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
you
identified...
let
me
respond
this
way.
you've
identified
these
procedures
in
skinner
and
von
raab.
i
do
not
read
those
opinions
to
say
that
each
and
every
one
of
those
is
essential,
and
i
do
not
read
that
opinion
to
say
you
give
greater
weight
to
one
or
the
other.
at
the
same
time,
i
don't
read
those
opinions
to
say
that
a
program
completely
lacking
in
all
of
them
would
pass
muster,
which
is
what
we
have
here,
so
i
can't
say
that
if
they
have
no
direct
observation
but
they
still
require
disclosure
of
medications,
and
they
don't
use
independent
monitors,
that
that
would
pass
muster.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
those
are
two
factors
that
do
reduce
the
intrusiveness,
but
as...
let
me
speak
to
both
of
them,
first
the
fact
that
this
is
voluntary.
you
don't
have
to
play
athletics.
that's
true,
but
you
have
to
appreciate
how
important
athletics
is
to
the
school
experience,
especially
in
this
school
district.
the
testimony
on
that
is
quite
clear.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
actually,
that
was
my
opponent
who
painted
that
picture,
but--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--that
was
the
testimony
they
presented,
and
i'm
just
illustrating
the
ramifications
of
that.
to
say
that
this
is
simply
athletics
and
you
don't
have
to
play
sports
doesn't
quite
answer
the
question.
that...
it
still...
it
may
be
voluntary,
but
it's
an
important
part
of
the
school
experience,
and
to
compel
a
student
to
give
that
up
in
order
to
protect
themselves
from
this
search
just
simply
isn't
justified.
now,
as
to
your
second
point
that
we're
talking
here
about
students
and
not
adults,
there
should
not
be
a
different
standard
for
students
than
adults.
a
different
standard
might
be
justified
if
the
government...
if
you
accept
the
proposition
that
the
government
is
substantially
less
interested
in
preventing
drug-related
injuries
to
students
than
adults,
or
if
you
accept
the
proposition
that
students
have
substantially
less
privacy
interest,
that
urine
testing
is
for
them
not
so
severe
an
invasion
of
privacy
as
it
is
for
adults.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
i
don't
know.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
i
am
not
contending
the
student's
rights
of
privacy
are
coextensive
with
an
adult's,
and
i
think
you've
held
otherwise
in
t.l.o.,
but
i'm
saying
when
you
come
to
something
so
private
and
personal
as
the
passing
of
urine,
that
their
rights
certainly
extend
that
far.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
no.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
it
would
not,
we
don't
believe,
if
they
required
just
as
a
condition
of
going
to
school
that
they
take
a
urine
test.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
well,
you
said
in
skinner
that
blood
tests,
compelled
removal
of
blood
as
opposed
to
a
urine
test,
is
substantially
less
intrusive,
but
i
don't
think
that
they
would
be
justified
in
compelling
a
student
to
produce
blood,
simply--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--i'm
not
assuming
that
there's
no
nation-wide
drug
problem
in
the--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--no.
i
think
you
need
to
judge
each
drug-testing
program
byu
the
problem
it's
intended
to
solve,
district
by
district,
school
by
school.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
no,
because
my
first
contention
is
that
you
don't
need
the
drug
test
in
order
to
solve
the
problem
of
disorders...
disorderly
behavior
in
the
schools,
so
whatever--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--we
still
don't
think
that
it
would
be
justified,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
they
do
require
a
physical
exam.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
i'm
not
saying
that.
i
don't
think
that
i
need
to
contend
that
here.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
because
this
is
so
highly
intrusive.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
that's--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--the
medical
exam
you're
talking
about
is
being
conducted
in
private
by
the
student's
doctor.
it
is
not
being
conducted--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--i
think
it
is
private
when
it
is
being
compelled
by
the
government,
and
the
government
is
there
watching
and
observing
and
collecting
specimens.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
it's
not--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--it's
not
the
mere
act.
we
all
urinate.
that's...
has
to
be
conceded.
[laughter]
in
fact,
i
might
do
so
here,
if--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
i
appreciate
the
help,
and
what
i
think
is
the
point
here
is
that
this
is
being
compelled
by
the
government,
they're
watching
you
do
it,
they're
taking
your
urine,
and
they're
analyzing
it
to
see
what
secrets
therein,
and
at
the
same
time
they
are
compelling
a
student
to
come
forward
and
disclose
all
their
private
medications,
and
that
is
highly
intrusive
and
personal
to
most
people.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
the
disclosure
of
private
medications,
both
prescription
and
nonprescription,
is
compelled
by
the
policy
statement
itself,
and
is
also
compelled
by
the...
exhibit
109
is
the
urine
sample
specimen
form.
you
have
to
fill
that
out
at
the
time
you--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--it's
part
of
the
case.
all
of
the
testing
protocol
is
part
of
the
case.
we
think
that
it
is
intrusive
for
all
those
reasons
as
well
as
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
serve
a
compelling
governmental
interest.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
correct,
but--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--but
as
justice
souter
indicated,
that...
my
fallback
position
is
that
if
you
say
drug
testing
is
okay,
then
i
at
least
want
to
stop
this
drug
test
because
it
is
being
performed
in
an
especially
intrusive
fashion.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
no,
we
think
not,
but
the
problem
here
is
twofold.
one,
the
purposes
for
which
they're
testing
are
not
compelling
enough:
maintaining
order
in
the
classroom
and
preventing...
and
preserving
athletic
safety,
but
in
addition
to
that--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--well,
your
honor,
drugs
do
have
a
problem,
and
no
one
is
denying
that,
and
they're
a
problem
for
the
young
and
the
old,
and
if
simply
the
problem
of
drugs
on
the
user
is
sufficient
to
justify
the
government
in
compelling
urine
tests,
then
we
should
all
be
subjected
to
urine
tests.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
that's
true,
it
does
affect
them
in
many
ways,
and
it's
a
tragedy
if
someone
takes
drugs,
young
or
old,
but
it
has
not
been...
that
has
not
been
offered
as
justification
by
the
school
district
for
this
drug
test,
and
if
you
accept
that
as
justification
for
drug
testing
students,
then
i
think
that
you
have
arrived
very
nearly
at
universal
drug
testing,
because
you
could
not
confine
your
ruling
to
the
school
setting.
drugs
present
all
those
problems
to
adults--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--as
to
students.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
the
parents
may
have
that
right.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
but
the
schools
don't.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
i
don't
think
they
have
sufficient
authority
to
justify
this
intrusion
on
privacy,
and
some
of
what
we
have
been
referring
to
are
children,
are
18
years
of
age.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
they're--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--i'd
just
point
out,
they're
old
enough
to
vote
and
serve
on
juries.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
my
client
was
in
seventh
grade
at
the
time
of
this
drug
test.
he
is
a
sophomore
now.
he
will
be
18--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--it's
not,
but
he's
seeking
an
injunction
against
having
to
submit
to
this
test
for
the
balance
of
his
high
school
career--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--which
will
take
him
to
age
17.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
well,
as
i
understood,
a
random
breathalyzer
test.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
yes.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
correct,
and
i
would
add
that
you're
doing
all
of
that
without
ever
having
given
suspicion
to
suspect
that
you've
done
anything
wrong.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
correct.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
it
must
be
possible,
because
it
was
in
skinner
and
von
raab,
although
i
do
not
know
why
the
school
district
here
did
not,
after
skinner
and
von
raab,
adopt
the
same
procedures.
maybe
there
was
something--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--not--
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
--it
would
not
go
far
enough.
mr.
thomas
m.
christ
pardon
me?
