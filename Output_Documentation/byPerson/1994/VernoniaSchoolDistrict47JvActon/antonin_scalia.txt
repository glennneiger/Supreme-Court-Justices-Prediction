it
must
have
been
a
very
effective
program,
then--
justice
antonin
scalia
--shows
how
effective
it
was,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
it
was
because
they
did
not
think
that
the
drinking
of
alcohol,
which
kids
have
been
doing
for
a
long
time,
produced
the
kind
of
classroom
disruption
that
harder
drugs
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
guess
a
school
where
it
has
a
problem
with
drug
use
where
it
isn't
the
athletes
who
seem
to
be
leading
the
thing,
they're
just
sort
of
out
of
luck.
you're
a
lucky
school
if
it's
the
athletes
who
are
the
potheads,
but
if
you're
in
another
school
there's
really
nothing
you
can
do
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
wasn't
the
question
you
were
asked.
the
question
you
were
asked
is
not
whether
this
one
is
particularly
defensible,
but
where
the
other
one
is
defensible,
and
you
said
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
it
was
coerced?
i
mean,
even
though
they
said
you
can't
play
on
the
varsity
team
unless
you
give
the
consent?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
consent
form
is
bound
in
with
the
whole
program.
i
agree,
if
you
just
ask
voluntarily,
whoever's
willing
to
undergo
testing,
no
penalty
if
you
don't...
is
that
the
kind
of
consent
form
you're
talking
about,
or
is
the
consent
form
in
this
case?
the
consent
form
in
this
case
was...
well,
would
have
been
coerced.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
suspicion,
unless
you
mean
by
suspicion
probable
cause,
i
mean,
a
high
degree
of
proof,
you're
always
going
to
get
people
who
are
utterly
innocent,
and
i
frankly
would
find
it
much
more
shameful
to
be
picked
out
and
sent
to
have
a
drug
test
because
i'm
suspected
of
using
drugs
than
i
would
to
be
part
of
a
general
school
population
who
just
repeatedly
do
this.
indeed,
wouldn't
there
be
a
right
to
individualized
hearings
before
one
is,
in
effect,
accused
of
having
used
drugs?
could
you
do
that
without
giving
some
individual
hearing
to
the
student?
and
all
of
a
sudden
we're
into
a
big
deal
of
a
due
process
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
don't
think
it
was
a
lawsuit
if
they
didn't
have
reasonable
suspicion?
i
mean,
i
can
just
imagine
a
parent
whose
child
has
been
sent
down
to
have
drug
testing
because
the
child
was
"suspected"
of
having
used
drugs,
and
the
parent
saying,
my
child
never
used
drugs,
not...
never
suspected
at
all.
it's
a
lawsuit,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see,
you're
not
suspected
of
using
drugs.
just
bad
kids
can
be
drug-tested,
misbehaving
students.
there's
no
suspicion
of
drugs
involved
at
all.
you're
just...
you're
a
bad
actor.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
it's
better
to
be
selected
as
one
of
the
few
in
the
school
to
be
drug-tested
on
the
basis
of
a
suspicion,
than
to
be
part
of
the
general...
what
is
the
intrusion
that
is
involved?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
have
some
factors
here
that
didn't
exist
there,
and
that
is
the...
this
is
an
athletic
program.
it's
not
that
you
have
to
leave
school
entirely,
it's
just
that
you
don't
play
athletics.
you
didn't
have
in
von
raab
the
factor
that
these
are
minors
in
a
tutelary
context.
surely
that's
a
factor
that
cuts
in
favor
of
being
able
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
painted
a
very
depressing
picture
of
this
town,
as
i
recall.
you
said
there's
virtually
nothing
else
to
do
except
go
to
the
intramural
athletic
games.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
[laughter]
i
know
somebody
did.
i
certainly
didn't
want
to
visit
the
place.
justice
antonin
scalia
haven't
we
allowed
schools
to
impose
mild
corporal
punishment?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
think
we
have,
and
why
is
that?
because
the
school
has
at
least
some
portion
of
the
authority
that
the
parent
has
when
the
child
goes
to
school.
it
seems
to
me
you
just
cannot
assume
that
children
in
that
kind
of
a
context
have
all
of
the
rights
that
an
emancipated
adult
has
in
a
context
such
as
von
raab.
justice
antonin
scalia
students
are
kids.
you
have
no
doubt
that
the
parents
can
do
this
if
they
want
to,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
dealing
with
people
who
are
subject
to
others'
tutelage,
and
the
question
here
is
to
what
extent
some
of
that
authority
and
responsibility
can
be
exercised
by
the
school
districts
even
when
the
parent,
particularly
the
parent
in
this
case,
doesn't
want
it
to
be
exercised.
there
may
be
parents
who
don't
like
corporal
punishment
in
schools,
for
example,
but
we've
indicated
that
we...
it
existed
at
common
law,
and
we
won't
use
the
eighth
amendment
to
say
you
can't
have
it,
so
you
either
accept
it,
or
you
don't
go
to
public
school,
and
the
question
here
is
whether
this
is
another
instance
like
that.
but
you're
dealing
with
children.
you're
not
dealing
with
adults
who
have
a
totally
different
set
of
rights.
the
question
is
to
what
extent
the
school
has
some
of
the
authority
of
the
parents
in
this
regard.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case,
number
94-590
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit.
the
petitioner
is
vernonia
school
district
47j,
which
operates
the
public
schools
in
the
small
logging
town
of
vernonia,
oregon.
in
the
late
1980s,
the
school
district
began
experiencing
a
severe
problem
with
drug
use
among
its
students.
students
began
to
speak
out
about
their
attraction
to
the
drug
culture
and
to
boast
that
there
was
nothing
that
schools
could
do
about
it.
along
with
more
drugs
came
more
disciplinary
problems.
school
officials
discovered
that
student
athletes
were
not
only
part
of
the
drug
culture
but
were
indeed
its
leaders.
in
vernonia
as
in
many
other
small
towns
in
america,
school
sports
play
a
prominent
part
in
the
community
life
and
school
athletes
become
role
models.
concerned
that
the
athletes'
bad
example
was
affecting
the
entire
student
body
and
also
pushing
to
reduce
the
risk
of
sports
related
injuries
that
can
offer
if
an
athlete
is
impaired
by
drugs.
the
district
adopted
the
student
athlete
drug
policy.
this
requires
that
all
students
who
participate
in
school
athletics
submit
to
your
analysis
drug
testing
at
the
beginning
of
the
season
for
their
sport
and
to
random
your
analysis
drug
testing
there
and
after.
each
week
the
names
of
10%
of
the
student
athletes
are
drawn
for
testing.
the
respondent
james
acton
who
was
then
in
the
seventh
grade
was
excluded
from
participation
on
his
school's
football
team
because
he
and
his
parents
refused
to
consent
to
the
drug
testing
program.
they
filed
suit
claiming
that
the
policy
violated
the
fourth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution
as
well
as
the
oregon
constitution.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
policy
violated
both
the
federal
and
state
constitutions.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
we
hold
that
the
policy
does
not
violate
the
united
states
constitution.
state
compelled
collection
and
testing
of
urine
is
of
course
a
search,
which
must
meet
the
fourth
amendment's
requirement
of
reasonableness
in
order
to
be
constitutional.
at
least
where
there
was
no
clear
practice
either
approving
or
disapproving
the
type
of
search
at
issue
at
the
time
of
the
framing
of
constitution,
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
is
judged
by
balancing
the
intrusion
on
an
individual's
legitimate
expectations
of
privacy
against
the
government's
interest
advanced
by
this
search.
applying
this
test
we
find
that
the
district's
policy
is
reasonable.
the
most
important
factor
in
our
decision
is
that
the
subjects
of
this
search
are
children
who
have
been
committed
to
the
temporary
custody
of
the
state
as
schoolmaster.
in
that
capacity,
the
state
may
exercise
a
greater
degree
of
supervision
and
control
than
it
could
exercise
over
three
adults,
because
of
this
relationship
children
and
public
schools
have
a
reduced
expectation
of
privacy
which
is
already
compromised
by
requirements
that
student
submit
a
certain
physical
examinations
and
receive
vaccinations.
the
legitimate
privacy
expectations
of
student
athletes
are
even
lesser.
since
an
element
of
communal
undress
is
inherent
in
athletic
participation
and
athletes
voluntarily
subject
themselves
to
greater
regulation
of
their
conduct
than
to
students
who
choose
not
to
participate.
against
this
interest
we
weighed
a
severity
of
the
intrusion
caused
by
the
policy.
we
find
that
the
privacy
interest
compromised
by
the
process
of
obtaining
the
urine
samples
are
negligible,
since
samples
are
collected
under
conditions
nearly
identical
to
those
routinely
encountered
in
public
restrooms.
furthermore,
the
test
looks
only
for
standard
drugs
not
private
medical
conditions
and
the
results
of
the
test
are
released
only
to
a
limited
group
of
school
officials
who
have
a
need
to
know
the
information.
the
nature
and
the
immediacy
of
the
government's
interest
and
the
efficacy
of
this
means
for
meeting
it,
also
contribute
to
our
conclusion
that
the
policy
is
reasonable.
the
importance
of
deterring
drug
use
by
public
school
children
cannot
be
doubted.
the
effects
of
drug
use
disrupt
the
education
of
children
for
whom
the
state
has
undertaken
a
special
responsibility
of
care
and
direction.
moreover,
the
policy
is
directed
only
to
student
athletes,
who
suffer
the
increased
risk
that
their
drug
use
will
cause
them
to
injure
themselves
or
other
players
during
athletic
competition.
it
seems
self-evident
that
a
drug
problem
largely
fueled
by
the
role
model
effective
athletes'
drug
use
and
which
causes
particular
danger
to
athletes
is
effectively
addressed
by
ensuring
that
athletes
do
not
use
drugs.
we
reject
respondent's
argument
that
the
program
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
not
based
on
individual
suspicion
of
drug
use.
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
require
that
the
least
intrusive
search
to
be
conducted
and
in
any
event
we
do
not
believe
that
a
program
of
individualized
suspicion
would
truly
be
less
intrusive.
since
it
would
risk
arbitrary
singling
out
of
disfavored
students
for
drug
testing
and
would
inject
an
element
of
adversariness
into
what
is
otherwise
is
a
prophylactic
and
non-punitive
drug
testing
program.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
ginsburg
while
joining
the
opinion
of
the
court
has
also
filed
a
separate
concurrence.
justice
o'connor
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
souter
and
have
joined.
