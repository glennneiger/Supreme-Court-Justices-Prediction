mr.
volpert,
isn't
there
a
significant
difference
between
the
people
who
go
to
school,
who
are
required
to
go
to
school
by
state
law,
and
athletes?
the
athletes
sign
a
consent
form,
do
they
not?
isn't
there
a
difference
between
athletics,
which
is
a
volunteer
activity...
i
thought
that
you
were
relying
on
that
distinction,
and
that's
why
you
were
limiting
the
testing
to
the
athletics
program,
but
now
you
tell
me
no,
it's
just
on
the
basis
of
pervasive
drugs.
you
could
randomly
test
all
students.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
volpert,
we
have
findings.
what
did
the...
the
district
court
made
findings,
and
the
ninth
circuit
said,
we
accept
those
findings.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
rejected...
even
though
the
ninth
circuit
came
out
the
other
way.
those
facts
are
the
ones
that
control
this
case.
and
what
were
the
facts
that
the
district
court
found?
did
they
find...
the
district
court
find
that
everybody
in
the
school
was
involved,
or
what
exactly
is
the
fact
basis
for
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
side
says
it
shows
no
problem,
the
other
side
it
shows
how
effective
it
is--
[laughter]
--but
i'm
wondering,
mr.
volpert,
why
you
didn't
test
for
the
most
frequently
used
controlled
substance...
well,
it's
not
a
controlled
substance--
--steroids.
--alcohol.
steroids.
it's
alcohol,
i
think.
don't
kids
drink
beer
and
wine?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
seamon,
you
answer
that
you
have
some
reservations
about
testing
everyone
based
on
what
this
court
did
in
von
raab.
there
was
a
whole
category
of
employees.
the
case
was
remanded,
was
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
what
was
the
follow-up
on
remand
with
respect
to
all
those
other
people,
the
accountants,
the
animal
caretakers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
have
an
unruly
student,
the
teacher
reports
a
student
as
unruly,
on
your
individual
testing,
or
individual
suspicion
basis,
could
every
unruly
student
be
then
subject
to
urinalysis
because
the
teacher
says,
i've
got
a
discipline
problem
here,
maybe
it's
drugs,
let's
test
her?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
christ,
i'd
like
you
to
be
as
concrete
as
possible
about
this,
because
i
was
troubled
by
your,
well,
you
can...
the
answer
is
individual
testing.
isn't
that
fraught
with
the
risk
that
the
teacher
is
going
to
pick
out
the
kid
he
doesn't
like,
and
those
are
the
people
that
will
be
subject
to
the
discipline,
as
opposed
to
the
random
selection?
there's
something
even
about
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
what
is
the
program?
can
you
be
concrete
about
the
program
that
you
think
would
be
appropriate?
first,
could
the
school
have
the
physical
exam
on
the
school's
premises?
you
distinguished
the
physical
exam
because
you
said
it's
in
the
privacy
of
the
student's
own
physician's
office,
but
suppose
the
school...
this
is
a
wealthy
district,
and
said,
we're
going
to
do
it
all
in
school.
would
that
be
all
right?
physical
exam
includes
everything
including
urinalysis.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
christ,
you
made
a
grand-scale
attack
on
this.
this
is
a
child
whose
parents
did
not
wish
the
form
to
be
signed.
the
child
didn't
want
it
to
be
signed.
you
never
got
to
any
refined
question
of,
well,
i'll
sign
it
but
i
won't
disclose
what
drugs
i'm
taking,
what
prescription
drugs
i'm
taking,
so
that's...
whether
that
feature
of
the
program
is
infirm
is
not
part
of
this
case,
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
case
is
not
one
to
modify
this
program.
your
case
is
one
that,
i'm
not
required
to
submit
to
it,
period--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--not
that
it
can
be
tailored
in
some
way
that
it
would
be
satisfactory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it's
not
a
class
action,
so
that's
the
case
that's
before
us.
