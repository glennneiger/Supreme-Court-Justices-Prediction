william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
94-590,
vernonia
school
district.
is
that
the
way
you
pronounce
the
name
of
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--versus
wayne
acton.
mr.
volpert.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
our
decision
in
the
city
of
renton
case
dealing
with
adult
bookstores
and
so
forth?
there
we
said
that
one
city
council
could
rely
on
findings
made
by
other
city
councils
as
to
the
effect
of
adult
bookstores
in
connection
with
neighborhood
deterioration?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
didn't
the
district
here
have
some
fear
of
injury
to
the
athletes
as
a
result
of
drug
use?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
seamon.
mr.
christ,
we'll
hear
from
you.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
christ,
mr.
christ.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
surely
the
drug
problem
goes
deeper
than
just...
if
it
exists,
and
the
courts
below
found
it
did,
goes
deeper
than
just
misbehavior
in
class,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
it
has
other
deleterious
consequences.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
agree,
don't
you...
and
surely
it's
done
all
over
the
country
for
every
high
school
sport...
you've
got
to
take
a
physical
exam
before
you
can
participate?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
much
privacy
is
there
in
a
boy's
locker
room
with
a
bunch
of
urinals
lined
up
against
the
wall,
guys
walking
naked
from
the
shower
to
the
lockers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
christ,
supposing
that
instead
of
feeling
that
drugs
were
the
problem
in
the
high
school,
the
board
had
felt
that
it
was
alcohol
that
was
a
problem,
and
that
they
had
the
same
reason
to
attribute
it
to
athletes
as
the
board
here
did
to...
drugs
to
athletes,
and
so...
but
they
don't
set
up
a
urine
testing
program,
they
set
up
a
breathalyzer
program
under
exactly
the
same
circumstances
here.
is
that...
i
mean,
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
is,
is
it
the
fact
that
it's
the
urine
factor
that
makes
this
invalid,
or
is
it
the
factor
that
the
government
administers
a
test
to
some
individual?
is
a
breathalyzer
test
okay?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
there
something
broader,
the
idea
that
drug
use
has
a
lot
more...
brings
with
it
a
lot
more
problems
than
that,
just
to
try
to
ferret
out
drug
use?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
school
performance
on
tests,
not
necessarily
disruptive
performance,
but
it
just
affects
a
student
in
many,
many
ways,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--surely
the
school...
the
school
has
an
interest
in
seeing
students
learn
and
perform
in
a
way
that
the
government
has
no
interest
in
seeing
citizens
in
general.
i
mean,
they
are
not...
the
government
is
not
the
tutor
of
its
citizens
generally.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
client's
in
seventh
grade?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
christ.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
vernonia
school
district
versus
acton
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
