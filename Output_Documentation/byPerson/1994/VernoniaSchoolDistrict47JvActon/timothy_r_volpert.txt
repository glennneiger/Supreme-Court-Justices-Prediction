mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
yes,
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
is
whether
a
school
district
faced
with
a
serious
drug
problem
with
student
athletes
at
its
core
may
reasonably
require
athletes
to
submit
to
drug
testing
absent
individualized
suspicion.
the
school
district
has
established
a
serious
threat
to
its
ability
to
educate
its
students
and
to
the
safety
of
its
athletes--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--the
hard
evidence
of
drug
use
consists,
justice
souter,
of
observations
on
numerous
occasions
by
a
teacher
of
students
smoking
marijuana
across
the
street,
arrests
of
student
athletes
for
using
drugs,
confiscation
of
drug
paraphernalia
on
school
grounds,
admissions
by
students
to
the
principal
that
they
have
used
drugs,
admissions
by
certain
student
athletes
to
the
coaches
that
they
had
used
drugs,
coaches'
observations
of
marijuana
coming
from
the
room
of
athletes
the
day
after
a
serious
injury--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--i'm
sorry,
of
what?
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
there
were
no
other
instances
that
i
can
recall
from
the
record,
justice
souter,
where
the
smell
of
marijuana,
where
the
teachers
or
coaches
noticed
the
smell
of
marijuana.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
well,
i
could
only
answer
that
by
saying
that
i
believe
that
we
have
numerous...
i
don't
believe,
we
do
have
numerous
observations,
admissions,
proof
of
athletes
being
arrested
for
the
use
of
drugs,
and
there
is...
i
believe
what
you're
referring
to
is,
there
is
one
instance,
and
i
did
not
mean
to
speak
of
it
in
the
plural,
where
a
wrestler...
where
a
coach
smelled
marijuana
coming
from
a
wrestler's
room.
the
one
thing
that
it
seems
to
me
is
missing
from
this
record
is
a
direct
observation
of
a
student
athlete
using
drugs
and
then,
for
instance--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--if
you
mean
urinalysis
drug
testing,
justice
o'connor,
no,
they
did
not.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
no,
they--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--we
did
not--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--excuse
me.
we
did
not
ever
combine
reasonable
suspicion
with
urinalysis
drug
testing.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
there's
no
direct
evidence
in
the
record
with
regard
to
that.
i
can
only
surmise
that
the
district
determined,
the
school
district
and
the
school
board
made
a
reasonable
determination
that
first
of
all
they
would
have
difficulty
making
a
reasonable
accusation
based
only
on
suspicion
of
drug
intoxication,
and
second
of
all,
that
they
assumed
that
there
would
not
be
the
deterrent
effect
that
a
random
drug
testing
program
would
have,
because
the
only
way
to...
if
you
are
basing
it
on
reasonable
suspicion,
you
are
largely
left
to
observing
behavior,
and
bizarre
behavior,
and
then
reaching
a
conclusion--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--well,
the--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--the
problem
is
that
if
someone
says
on
wednesday
that
they
have
used
drugs
in
the
past,
i
am
not
at
all
convinced
that
there
would
be
a
reasonable
suspicion
sufficient
to
test
them
at
that
time,
just
based
on
conversations
of
past
drug
use.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
that
this
court's
holdings
in
skinner
and
von
raab,
this
court
could
reach
such
a
conclusion.
however,
i
think
that
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
drawing
the
line
and
requiring
individual
school
districts
to
establish,
or
to
reasonably
conclude
that
they
have
individual
problems.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
if
the
school
district
on
the
local
level
determined
that
there
was
a
serious
drug
problem
in
one
of
the
schools,
and
after
deliberation
reached
a
reasonable
conclusion
that
there
was
an
immediate
threat
to
the
other
schools,
i
believe
you
could.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
certainly
a
school
district
could
rely
on
evidence
of
a
drug
problem
in
neighboring
school
districts.
i
also
believe
that
based
on
this
court's
decisions,
especially
in
von
raab,
this
court
could
decide
that
a
school
district
without
any
drug
problem
could
rely
on
national
evidence,
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
drawing
a
line
and
allowing
individual
school
boards
to
make
that
determination.
that
is
not
to
say
that
it
would
have
to
be
based
on...
that
it
has
to
be
based
on
evidence
in
each
school
in
the
district.
that
does
not
say
that
it
cannot
be
based
on
evidence
of
a
drug
problem
in
the
county,
or
in
the
general
area.
if
there
is
a
reasonable
belief
of
a
serious
and
eminent
threat
of
drug
use
in
the
schools,
we
believe
that
testing
should
be
allowed.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
justice
souter,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
i
believe
we
have
probably
made
a
sufficient
case
for
drug
testing
of
the
entire
student
body
of
the
vernonia
school
district.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
no.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
no,
that
would
not
be
our
argument.
our...
my
argument
is
that
that,
in
fact,
occurred.
i
would
not...
to
the
extent...
i
would
not
base
that
on
speculation
that
because
athletes
are
using
drugs,
that
there
might
be
a
spillover
effect.
in
this
case,
there
is
proof,
i
believe
the
district
court
called
beyond
any
reasonable
doubt,
that
there
was
a
drug
problem
which
was
all-pervasive
throughout
the
school
system,
athletes
and
nonathletes.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
justice
ginsburg,
in
this
case
we
have
a
serious
threat
to
athletes
and
a
serious
threat
to
preservation
of
discipline
and
order
in
the
schools.
in
our
case,
we
have
both.
in
response
to
justice
souter's
question,
i
was
simply
suggesting
that
it
would
be
possible
to
establish
a
situation
that
was
so
bad
in
the
general
school
population
and
was
such
a
threat
to
the
preservation
of
order
in
the
schools
that
would
justify
testing
of
all
athletes...
excuse
me,
of
all
students.
that
is
not--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--i
think
hypothetically
we
could
have
made
that
case
under
these
facts.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
our
case
is
based
on
both.
i
am
responding
to
a
hypothetical.
i
do
not
think
that
in
all
circumstances
it
is
necessary
for
you
to
have
both.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
extreme
problem.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
well,
i
don't
think
so,
justice
stevens,
because
if
you...
it's
kind
of
hard
to
characterize
the
record
in
this
case,
but
when
you
read
the
record
in
its
entirety,
you
realize
the
extent
to
which
drug
use
became...
the
extent
to
which
disciplinary
problems
became
pervasive.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
correct.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
the
district
court
found,
justice
ginsburg,
a
startling
and
progressive
increase
in
the
use
and
glamorization
of
drugs,
characterized
the
studert
body
being
in
a
state
of
rebellion,
characterized...
said
a
general
flagrant
attitude
that
there
was
nothing
the
school
could
do
about
their
conduct
or
drug
use
typified
a
usual
day.
teachers
testified
about
a
tremendous
difference
in
the
type
of
behavior
than
they
had
seen
over
the
course
of
the
last
16
or
17
years.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
pardon
me?
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
justice
stevens,
the
district
court
found
that
the
athletes
were
among
the
leaders
of
the
group
in
the
classroom
who
were
causing
disruptions.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
how
do
they
know
that--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--that
the
athletes
were
being
disruptive?
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
well,
the
district
courts
referred
to
the
conclusion
that
this
was...
that
the
conduct
was
drug-related,
if
that's
what
you're
asking,
as
being
inescapable,
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
the
district...
the
district
officials
observed
conduct
which
was
so
far
out
of
the
norm
that
drug
use
was
a
logical
conclusion.
now--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--well,
i
don't
think
so
necessarily.
if
you
see
in
the
classroom
someone
misbehaving,
and
you're
a
teacher,
you
at
that
point
have
to
make
an
important
choice
if
you're
suggesting
that
you
drug
test
based
on
individualized
suspicion.
you
have
to
decide...
make
very
difficult
decisions
as
to
whether
this
behavior
is
so
bizarre
that
it
indicates
the
use
of
drugs,
and
that
you're
going
to
make
an
accusation
and
drag
someone
down
to
the
principal's
office--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--well--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--there
was
no...
let
me
draw
a
distinction,
justice
o'connor.
there
was
no
drug
testing
program
based
on
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
the
district
took
many,
many
steps
to
try
to
solve
it
as
a
behavioral
problem--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--observing
behavior
and
dealing
with
it.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
we
have
never
relied
on
the
consent
form
in
this
case.
james
acton--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--did
not
sign
a
consent.
yes,
i
believe
we
could.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
the
problem,
justice
o'connor,
with
individualized
suspicion
is
clear
in
our
record
in
the
problem
of
drugs,
it
was
clear
in
the
record
in
skinner,
and
clear
in
the
record
in
von
raab.
because
it
is
so
difficult
to
detect
for
certain
that
you
have
any
kind
of
drug
involvement
in
behavior,
especially
with
adolescents--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--no,
it
does
not,
but
when
you
are
asking
a
teacher
to
actually
make
an
accusation
of
drug
use,
and
that
accusation
is
based
on
a
number
of
circumstances,
it
is
far
less
intrusive
in
a
circumstance
like
this
to
allow
the
random
drug
testing
rather
than
just
fingering
individual
athletes,
taking
them
to
the
principal's
office,
and
make
them
submit
to
the
test.
you
would
also--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--i
think
it
would,
justice
kennedy.
certainly
under
this
record
i
think
virtually
everyone
acting
up
in
the
classroom
would
have
been
taken
down
to
the
principal's
office
and
basically
accused
of
drug
use.
in
this
situation,
contrary
to
the
position--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--except
that
in
the
situation
of
individualized
suspicion,
you
are
telling
an
individual
student,
i
believe
that
you
are
using
drugs,
and
i
think
the
court
must
focus
on
the
burden
that
that
places
on
teachers
to
actually
make
that
type
of
accusation.
they
are
not
experts
in
the
field.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
that
would.
another
problem
with
reasonable
suspicion,
of
course,
is
in
the
case
of
drug
use,
most
of
the
time
you're
going
to
miss
it.
that
may
be
the
primary
problem.
the
expert
testimony
is
that
90
percent
of
the
time,
you're
not
going
to
detect
drug
use.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
it
began
in
the
fall
of
1989,
and
the
decision
from
the
ninth
circuit
was
rendered
last
spring.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
i
believe
the
testimony
was,
an
estimate
from
the
superintendent,
two
or
three.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
well,
it
was
a
very
effective--
[laughter]
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
i
believe
it
does,
justice
scalia.
it--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--i
will
focus
on
the
question
about
alcohol.
there's
no
direct
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
why
alcohol
was
not
tested.
i
would
assume,
if
i
may
infer
from
the
record,
that
the
district
believed
that
they
were
better
equipped
to
detect
the
use
of
alcohol
because
of
alcohol
being
on
one's
breath,
and
perhaps
the
effect
on
gait,
which
is
fundamentally
different
from
the
use
of
drugs.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
there
is
a
comment,
justice
scalia,
from
principal
aultman
to
that
effect,
that
alcohol
has
been
around
for
a
long
time.
i
think
he
was
probably
referring
to
that.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
no,
i
think--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--no,
i'm
not...
no
one's
saying
it's
okay,
justice
stevens,
but
i
think
the
school
board
made
a
determination
that
these
drugs
were
what
were
causing
the
problem,
and
it's
one
of
the
types
of
decisions
the
court--
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
--it
did
not
test
for
steroids.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
why
that
is,
although
i
understand
that
steroid
testing
is
very
expensive,
and
the
district
may
have
made
the
determination
based
on
the
cost.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
justice
souter,
we
have
never
argued
or
briefed
that
issue.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
no.
our
argument
here
is
that
the
behavior,
which
disrupted
the
classroom
severely,
and
the
threat
to
student
athletes
were
sufficient
to
jeopardize
compelling
governmental
interests
of
the
school.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
even
without
the
consent
form,
yes.
we
believe
that
this
policy
is
constitutional
notwithstanding
the
consent
form.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
your
question,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
could
i
ask
you
to
restate
the
question?
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
we
have
never
taken
the
position
that
it
was,
because
consent
was
not
given
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
r.
volpert
i'm
sorry,
i
do
not
have
a
position
on
that.
that's
never
been
briefed,
and
i
don't
have
a
position
on
that.
