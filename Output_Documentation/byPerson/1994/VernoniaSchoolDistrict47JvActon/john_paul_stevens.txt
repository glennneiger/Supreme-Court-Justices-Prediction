let
me
ask
a
different
question.
supposing...
if
it's
that
serious,
you're
also
assuming
it's
so
serious
you
can't...
you
wouldn't
have
any
individualized
suspicion
as
to
particular
students
who
might
be
using
drugs.
it
would
be
sort
of
a
contradiction,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
none
of
that
sounds
like
it's
confined
to
athletes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
none
of
that
sounds
like
it's
confined
to
athletes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
they
know
that
if
they
don't
have
individualized
suspicion?
that's
what
puzzles
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no.
they
know
who
the
leaders
are
who
are
the
most
frequent
users
of
drugs,
but
they
don't
have
any
individualized
suspicion
as
to
particular
individuals.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
would
be
individualized
suspicion,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
makes
alcohol
use
by
high
school
students
okay,
that
it's
been
around
a
long
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand
that
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
these
tests
pick
up
steroids,
which
i
suppose
athletes
might
be
more
inclined
to
take?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
one
athlete
related
drug
that
might
be
involved.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
seamon,
do
you
think
the
evidence
would
have
supported
a
random
program
not
limited
to
athletes,
but
for
the
entire
student
body?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
a
question
on
that
one,
if
i
might.
what
if
the
school
had
a
physical
examination
requirement
for
every
student
at
the
beginning
of
the
school
year
that
included
this
particular
urine
test,
would
that
be
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
about
a
physical
exam
with
everything
except
this
particular
test,
just
to
be
sure
they're
healthy,
and
for
the
good
of
the
kids,
to
find
out
if
there
was
any
problem
the
school
ought
to
be
aware
of?
can
they
take
blood?
blood
is
okay,
but
urine's
bad?
