justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
saying
actually
you
can't
have
a
medical
test?
you
couldn't...
i
mean,
a
school
district
couldn't
say
we
want
to
know
how
the
students,
whether
they're
nourished
properly,
whether
they're...
whether
they
have
disease,
how
they're
going...
and
so
what
we
want
to
do,
we'll
give
you
the
nurse
or
the
doctor,
but
you
couldn't
require
constitutionally
a
medical
test,
physical
exams?
can't
they
require
physical
exams
for
athletes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
so...
couldn't...
are
you
saying
they
couldn't
require
physical
exams
for
students
to
come
to
school?
they
want
to
know
how
the
health
of
a
student
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well
then,
the
problem,
of
course,
for
people
is,
if
they
can
require
the
physical
exams
for
the
health,
and
i
guess
you
could
require
medical...
metal
detectors
to
keep
guns
out
of
schools,
a
lot
of
things
you
can
require,
what's
different
about
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
medical
exams
all
involve
urinalyses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
probably
had
hundreds
of
them
in
my
life,
and
so
have
you,
and
you
know,
what's
the
special
thing
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
people
urinate,
you
know,
in
men's
rooms
all
over
the
country.
it's
not
necessarily...
and
i
don't
mean
to
be...
trivialize
it,
but
it
isn't
really
a
tremendously
private
thing,
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
do
is
to
pinpoint
precisely
what
it
is
that's
the
intrusion
of
the
privacy
interest.
that's
what
i'm
trying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
what
i'm
aiming
at.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
serious
point,
which
is
difficult.
i
think
it's
a
very
difficult
thing
to
do,
because
i,
like
you,
and
a
lot
of
other
people,
have
some
kind
of
instinct
that
there
is
something
private
going
on
here,
but
to
try
to
pinpoint
it
precisely
is
difficult,
and
it's
because
it
is
difficult
that
i'm
asking
you
the
question,
to
help
on
this,
to
the
extent
you
can,
to
try
to
pinpoint
just
what
it
is
about
this
test
that
is
private,
and
therefore
offends
you
and
many
others.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
i
wondered,
too.
is
there...
is
that
in
this
case?
that
is,
is
there
in
this
case
any
indication
that
people
who
had
medications
that
they
didn't
want
disclosed
have
to
proceed
with
the
normal
test,
or
is
there...
could
they
have
their
own
doctor
do
it
and
give
the
result,
or...
in
other
words,
how
much
is
that
in
this
case,
that
problem?
