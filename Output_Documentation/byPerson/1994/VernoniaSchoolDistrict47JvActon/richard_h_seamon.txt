mr.
richard
h.
seamon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing
a
question
that
arose
earlier.
the
question
was,
if
there
was
so
much
evidence
of
drug
use
in
vernonia,
why
wasn't
there
enough
individualized
suspicion
to
make
individualized
suspicion-based
testing
effective?
that
question
is
plainly
relevant
under
the
balancing
approach
this
court
applied
in
skinner
and
von
raab,
because
even
though
the
court
declined
to
impose
a
least
intrusive
means
requirement
in
its
analysis,
it
is
plain
that
alternatives
to
suspicionless
testing
are
relevant
to
decide
whether
suspicionless
testing
is
actually
necessary
to
further
the
governmental
interest
that
is
being
asserted,
and
i
think
that
the
limitations
of
individualized
suspicion
testing
are
illustrated
well
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
some
of
the
evidence
concerned
drug
use
by
individual
students,
and
would
have
permitted
individualized
suspicion-based
testing
of
those
students...
for
example,
the
students
from
whom
drug
paraphernalia
was
confiscated,
the
students
who
were
seen
smoking
marijuana
in
the
coffee
shop
across
the
street
from
the
school,
the
students
who
were
arrested
for
using
intoxicants
at
a
party
during
the
school
day.
but
this
was
not
the
only
relevant
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
was
a
drug
problem
in
vernonia.
the
school
district
witnessed
a
two
to
threefold
increase
in
disciplinary
problems
over
the
course
of
a
couple
of
years.
at
the
same
time,
it
witnessed
the
rise
of
an
apparent
drug
culture.
students
boasting
about
their
use
of
drugs,
whether
true
or
false,
was
certainly
relevant
to
the
officials'
assessment
of
whether
a
drug
problem
existed,
and
finally,
the
organization
of
groups
with
names
like
the
drug
cartel.
now,
maybe
the
fact
that
a
student
belongs
to
a
group
called
the
drug
cartel
does
not
provide
individualized
reasonable
suspicion
for
testing
that
individual.
that
would
be
a
debatable
point.
but
the
fact
that
such
a
group
springs
into
existence
at
the
same
time
that
there
is
a
two
to
threefold
increase
in
disciplinary
problems,
and
teachers
for
the
first
time
begin
hearing
students
boasting
about
drug
use
and
writing
about
it
in
essays
that
they
hand
in
to
be
graded
clearly
is
relevant
in
assessing
the
existence
of
a
drug
problem.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i
don't
think
that
it
would
have
supported
a
program
for
the
entire
student
body.
i
think
it's...
the
fact
that
the
program
in
this
case
was
limited
to
student
athletes
was
relevant,
and
supports
the
reasonableness
of
the
program
in
several
ways.
perhaps
first
and
foremost
is
the
fact
that
interscholastic
sports
is
a
voluntary
activity.
the
student
can
avoid
testing
simply
by
deciding
not
to
engage--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--the
required
courses
are
of
course
more
important,
in
our
view,
than
extracurricular
activities.
one
of...
and
the
reason
that
we
find
it
significant
that
this
testing
was
limited
to
students
who
participated
in
an
extracurricular
activity
is
that
it
gave
the
student
the
ability
to
avoid
testing
at
the
same
time
he
or
she
was
not
denied
access
to
the
required
curriculum
that
he
or
she
needed
to
get
a
diploma.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
we
would
not
draw
a
line--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--to
limit
drug
testing
to
student
athletes.
we
think
that
testing
of
athletes
is
particularly
defensible
because...
for
some
of
the
reasons--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--i'm
sorry
if
i
misstated
our
position.
it
is
not
our
position
that
drug
testing
of
all
students
would
be
invalid
in
all
circumstances.
if
a
school
district
had
a
severe
enough
drug
problem
that
it
reasonably
concluded
that
that
was
the
only
way
in
which
the
drug
problem
could
be
effectively
addressed,
then
such
a
program
may
well
be
permissible,
but
it
would
depend
to
a
large
extent
on
the
consequences
of
testing
positive.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
that's
right.
it
had
a
reasonable
fear
of
that,
and
that's
why
testing
of
athletes
was
particularly
defensible,
because
their
engaging
in
that
activity
and
playing
sports
posed
a
risk
of
physical
injury
both
to
themselves--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--well,
i...
let
me
complete
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
began
by
making
the
point
that
much
of
the
evidence
that
the
school
officials
could
reasonably
credit
as
pointing
to
the
existence
of
a
drug
problem
was
not
necessarily
focused
on
individual
students,
and
wouldn't
necessarily--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--and
some
was.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes,
to
the
extent
that
valid
consent
was
given
under
this
court's
cases.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
no.
valid
consent
is
a
basis
for
a
search,
and
that's
always
been
true.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
this
is--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--well,
this
is
the
difficult
question.
this
is,
i
suppose,
why
petitioner
isn't
relying
on
the
consent
forms.
in
many...
there
is
at
least
a
plausible
argument
to
the
extent
that
you're
denying
a
student
a
benefit
the
consent
is
coerced,
and--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--we
don't
rely
on
the
forms.
we
really
rely
on
the
voluntary
nature,
the
extracurricular
nature
of
the
activity
that
triggered
the
testing.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that.
i
suspect
that,
you
know--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
right,
and--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--that's
right,
and
that's
why
we
rely
on
the
extracurricular,
voluntary
nature
of
the
activity
than
the
concept
of
consenting
to
it
or
not,
because
questions
of
consent
can
become
very
difficult,
depending
on
the
value
of
the
benefit
that
you're
conditioning
the
consent
on.
i
want
to--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--yes,
that's
right.
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
yes.
the
district
court
on
remand
upheld
the
testing
program
with
respect
to
the
categories
of
employees
who
had
access
to
sensitive
classified
information,
and
it
noted
that
some
of
the
categories
that
this
court
expressed
concern
about,
including
animal
caretakers,
were
not
subject
to
the
testing--
mr.
richard
h.
seamon
--no,
we
do
not.
it
is
a
different
one,
and
it
is
important,
especially,
i
believe,
in
assessing
the
impact
of
individualized
suspicion-based
testing
in
this
context.
one
of
the
problems,
to
finish
my
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
with
individualized
suspicion-based
testing
is
that
in
a
sense
you
get
both
false
positives
and
false
negatives.
i
mean,
there
may
be
one
student
who
uses
drugs,
but
simply
sits
quietly
in
the
back
of
the
classroom
and
gets
straight
d's,
and
that
student
goes
unnoticed.
