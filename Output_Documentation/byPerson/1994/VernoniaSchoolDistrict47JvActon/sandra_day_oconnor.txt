justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
volpert,
did
the
school
district
try
a
drug
testing
scheme
based
on
reasonable
suspicion
that
a
particular
student
might
be
experimenting
with
drugs?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
same
kind
of
testing
you're
doing
under...
or
the
school
was
doing
under
this
random--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--testing.
you
didn't
ever
use
reasonable
suspicion,
and
for
those
that
the
coaches
suspected
of
using
drugs--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--ask
them
to
be
tested.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
relying
on
what
people
have
been
saying.
if
somebody
says
they
have
been
experimenting,
you
don't
think
that
would
give
rise
to
reasonable
suspicion--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
it
might
be
true?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
mr.
volpert,
isn't
that
pretty
much
what
the
fourth
amendment
is
designed
to
require,
something
based
on
individualized
suspicion,
and
the
school
district
didn't
even
try
that,
did
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
the
school
made
no
effort
to
at
least
launch
its
program
on
the
basis
of
some
kind
of
testing
based
on
individualized
suspicion,
and
i
think
in
the
school
context
we've
said
it
doesn't
have
to
be
probable
cause,
but
there
was
no
effort
made
to
do
that,
was
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
we
were
to
conclude
that
at
least
on
this
record
the
school
should
try
individualized
suspicion.
now,
it's
overlaid
here
by
the
use
of
consent
forms.
do
you
take
the
position
that
if
there
is
a
valid
consent
form
by
the
student
and
the
student's
parents
that
there
would
for
that
student
not
have
to
be
individualized
suspicion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
could
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
so
you
might
have
some
combination
in
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
reasonable
suspicion
doesn't
mean
for
certain,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
accused,
just
asked
to
be
tested,
isn't
that
the
proposal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
it's
combined,
however...
if
all
the
school
wants
to
do
is
test
student
athletes,
and
if
all
but
a
handful
have
signed
valid
consent
forms,
i
assume
as
to
those
with
valid
consent
forms
that
the
existing
program
could
be
used.
that
leaves
you
with
a
handful
of
people
who
decline
to
sign
a
consent
form,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
long
was
this
random
testing
in
effect
in
the
school?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
during
that
interval
of
time,
how
many
tests
turned
up
positive?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
thought
you
answered
my
question
about
the
consent
form
to
the
effect
that
that
alone
would
provide
the
basis
for
random
testing,
if
you
didn't
have
more.
that's
what
you
said.
do
you
want
to
retract
that
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
is
your
answer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
suppose
all
you
had
was
a
consent
form,
validly
obtained,
knowingly,
willingly
given
by
the
student
and
the
student's
parents,
is
that
enough
for
that
student
to
be
randomly
tested
for
drugs,
using
the
test
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
is
your
position
today?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
seamon,
you
started,
i
thought,
to
tell
us
why
the
school
district
couldn't
rely
on
individualized
reasonable
suspicion,
but
i
never
heard
you
answer
that
question
that
you
posed.
why
couldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
some
was.
they
could
have
tried
their
program
that
way.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
the
school
district
have
relied
on
the
consent
forms
for...
as
to
those
students
who
had
validly
executed
them?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
doesn't
trouble
like
your
predecessor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
random
test,
though,
didn't
subject
everyone.
i
thought
it
was
administered
to
a
few
on
a
random
basis.
it
wasn't
everyone
in
the
school,
and
it
wasn't
every
student
athlete,
was
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
initial
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
random
testing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
justification
offered
was
that
there's
an
increased
risk
of
physical
harm,
health
risks
to
athletes
who
are
using
drugs,
and
as
part
of
our
policy
in
the
school
to
weed
out
those
with
heart
problems,
or
those
with
other
special
risks
in
athletic
programs,
we're
going
to
require
this
kind
of
testing
for
health
purposes.
now,
would
that
be
sufficient
to
justify
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
not?
it
would
be
just
like
testing
for
a
hernia,
or
a
heart
problem,
or
asthma,
or
whatever
else
might
be
the
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
surely
you
would
not
take
the
position
that
a
school
can't
protect
itself
from
risk
of
injury
to
its
student
athletes
by
requiring
physical
exams
for
all
those
problems.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
your
position,
that
the
school
district
can't
do
that
for
a
student
athlete?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
it
make
any
difference
to
you
if
the
test...
if
the
student
had
an
option
of
going
to
a
private
clinic,
or
private
physician
to
have
the
test
done?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
that
save
it,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
say
if
all
those
things
were
done,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
you
say
that's
better,
but
that's
not
enough.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
is
enough?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
presumably
the
disclosure
of
what
other
prescription
drugs
you
might
be
taking
could
be
easily
cured.
these
samples
go
to
a
testing
lab,
and
the
student
could
fill
out
a
form
saying
what
they
are,
put
it
in
a
sealed
envelope,
and
have
it
transmitted
to
the
testing,
the
independent
testing,
without
ever
disclosing
to
the
school
district
at
all
what
private
prescription
medication
is
in
use.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
it
did,
then
that
would
go
a
long
way
towards
solving
your
objection,
i
gather.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
make
this
a
more
reasonable
program.
