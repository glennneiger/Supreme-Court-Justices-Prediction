do
you
think
that
the
rule
that
we
announce
ought
to
be
a
rule
that's
specific
on
a
school-by-school,
case-by-case
basis,
or
would
it
be
plausible
for
us
to
say,
a)
there
is
a
drug
problem
of
dangerous
proportions
in
this
middle
and
high
school
population
throughout
the
country,
and
that
even
those
schools
that
are
relatively
drug
free
have
a
strong
interest
in
keeping
themselves
that
way?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
each
district,
or
each
school?
suppose
there
are
three
high
schools,
one
with
a
serious
drug
problem,
the
other
mild...
the
other
mild
by
today's
standard,
which
means
only
10
percent
of
the
students
are
using
them
from
time
to
time...
and
the
other
substantially
less
than
that.
could
you
have
a
district-wide
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
not
only
less
intrusive,
i
take
it
the
suggestion
of
individualized
suspicion
would
alter
fundamentally
the
relation
between
the
student
and
the
teacher.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
little
bit
like
saying
going
to
graduation
is
a
voluntary
activity,
as
far
as
i'm
concerned.
a
lot
of
students
consider
that
a
very
important
part
of
their
education.
i'm
not
sure
why
you
should
draw
your
answer,
and
draw
the
line
you're
proposing
exactly
that
way.
if
there's
a
school-wide
problem,
what's
wrong
with
school-wide
testing?
it
certainly
seems...
in
one
sense,
the
required
courses
are
more
important
than
the
voluntary
courses.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
relation
between
schools
and
their
students
is
the
same
as
between
the
government
and
its
employees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
the
district
could
reasonably
conclude
that
the
dangers
of
an
individualized
suspicion
requirement
go
beyond
the
danger
that
the
teacher
might
single
out
the
unpopular
student,
but
that
it
changes
the
whole
relation
between
the
teacher
and
the
student?
one
of
the
big
complaints
of
teachers
is
that
they're
being
turned
into
policemen.
you
want
this
court
to
turn
them
into
policemen,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
want
us
to
structure
the
law
on
drug
testing
for
individualized
suspicion,
which
it
seems
to
me
is
a
very
significant
step
forward
in
assigning
the
responsibilities
of
this
sort
of
very,
very
difficult
and
highly
intrusive
judgment
to
the
teacher,
whereas
a
random
testing
program
eliminates
that
need
altogether,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
school
district
at
least
could
make
the
plausible
argument
that
this
is
a
reasonable
alternative
for
it
to
adopt.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it's
rather
hard
for
us
to
write
an
opinion
to
say
that
there's
a
less
intrusive
alternative
but
that
that's
unconstitutional,
too.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
that
rest
on
your
assumption
that
there's
no
nation-wide
drug
problem
in
the
schools?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
that
we
assume
that
there
is.
does
that
change
your
answer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
thirty
percent
users
in
a
rural
high
school,
would
that
be
sufficient
to
sustain
a
test
where
at
the
beginning
of
the
year
everybody
takes
a
physical
exam
and
there's
a
testing
for
drugs?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
talking
about
solving
the
problem
of
drugs
in
the
schools.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
this
record,
were
the
results
disclosed
to
the
school
officials?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
this
record,
in
this
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
there's
no
particular
guarantees
of
confidentiality?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
see.
