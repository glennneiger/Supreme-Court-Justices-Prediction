justice
david
h.
souter
has
it
identified
that
threat
as
drug
use,
as
opposed
to,
sort
of
a
lot
of
bragging
about
drug
use?
it
seems
to
me,
my
recollection
is
that
the,
kind
of
the
hard
evidence
on
the
actual
usage
was
on
the
thin
side,
whereas
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
that
people
were
going
around
bragging
about
drug
use,
glorifying
drug
use,
giving
the
impression
that
it
was
a
smart
thing
to
do,
and
kids
at
that
age
claim
to
have
done
a
lot
of
things
that
they
haven't
done.
where
does
the,
sort
of
the
hard
evidence
stop
and
the
evidence
of
talk
begin?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
was
one
example
of
that,
for
example.
was
there
more?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
the...
as
i
recall
the
briefs,
there
was
one
example
of
a
coach
going
into
a...
i
think
it
was
a
wrestler's
room,
and
he
smelled...
after
the
kid
had
been
injured,
and
he
smelled
pot.
i
mean,
were
there
other
instances
of
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
that's
what's
bothering
me,
because...
i'm
sure
you
didn't
intend
this,
but
i
think
you
spoke
of
it
in
the
plural,
and
yet
there
was
only
one
instance
of
it,
and
that's
why
i'm
troubled
by
the
difficulty
of
figuring
out
just
what
is
provably
there
about
use,
as
opposed
to
what
is
generalization,
or
what
is
generalization
about
student
bragging.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
by
the
same
reasoning,
shouldn't
testing
then
be
allowed
through
the
entire
school
population?
and
haven't,
in
fact,
you
made...
if
your
case
is
good
here,
haven't
you
in
fact
made
a
case
for
random
testing
of
the
entire
school
population
in
these
schools?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
your
argument
basically
is
that
the
nonathletes
tend
to
follow
the
lead
of
the
athletes,
so
that
if
your
hypothesis
is
right,
then
sort
of--
justice
david
h.
souter
--throughout
the
school
population
you're
doing
this.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
didn't
you
also
say
that
you
had
it
here,
that
you
had
made
the
case
here,
or
could
have
made
the
case
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
you
didn't...
on
your
theory
you
didn't
need,
as
justice
ginsburg
points
out,
the
feature
of
the
voluntary
consent
form.
justice
david
h.
souter
serious
enough
problem,
you
don't
need
the
consent;
less
serious
problem,
you
might
need
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
a
question
which
you
may
have
answered,
i
just
seem
to
be
unclear
on
it.
if
there
were
not
at
least
generalized
suspicion
that
there
was
a
drug
problem
in
schools,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
consent
form
would
be
sufficient
to
authorize
the
random
athletic...
systematically
random
athletic
testing
that
you
were
doing
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
your
position
is...
here
is
that
both,
i.e.,
the
behavioral
evidence
and
the
consent
forms,
are
sufficient,
and
that's
as
far
as
your
argument
goes?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
even
without
the
consent
from?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you
rely
on
the
forms
because
athletics
are
in
effect
an
incidental,
voluntary
activity?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let
me
give
you
a
different
example.
maybe
it
won't
make
a
difference,
but
let
me
give
it
to
you.
what
if
the
kids
at
the
national
honor
society
dance
had
been
found
smoking
pot,
and
the
school
adopted
a
policy
that
no
one
could
be
inducted
into
the
national
honor
society
without
signing
one
of
these
consent
forms,
would
that
consent
would
be
sufficiently
uncoerced
to
be
valid,
and
would
that
then
justify
testing
of
those
who
had
consented?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
reason
that
you're
concerned
about
it
that
you
know
perfectly
well
that
if
these
kids
want
to
get
into
a
good
college
and
they're
not
in
the
honor
society
or
the
record
says,
couldn't
join
the
honor
society
because
they
wouldn't
consent
to
drug
testing,
that
they're
going
to
be
at
a
tremendous
disadvantage
in
college
application?
isn't
that
the
problem?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
isn't
there
a
like
problem
for
the
student
athletes?
their
athletic
activities
are
taken
into
consideration
when
they
apply
to
colleges.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
have
a
fallback
position?
i
mean,
is
it
all
or
nothing
here?
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know
that's
the
position
you
have
taken,
but
i
mean
it
seriously.
do
you
have
a
fallback
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
back
to
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
take
you
back
to
the
question--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
seem
bent
on
interrupting
you.
i'm
sorry.
may
i
go
back
to
the
question
of
intrusiveness
again?
you
answered
the
chief
justice
that
a
breathalyzer
test,
if
alcohol
had
been
the
drug
of
concern
here,
that
a
breathalyzer
test
would
also
have
been
unconstitutional,
other
things
being
equal.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
other
things
being
equal,
administered
the
same
way,
just
do
it
by
breath.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
said
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it,
then,
that
the
intrusive
feature,
or
features,
which
are
of
concern
to
you
in
the
urine
test
in
fact
are
not
the
quasi-exposure
of
having
to
produce
the
sample
with
someone
standing
behind
you,
because
that
doesn't
occur
in
the
breath
test,
so
i
take
it
the
reasons
that
you
find
the
intrusiveness
to
be
unreasonable
is
that
you
are
disclosing
the
contents
of
something...
chemicals
in
your
urine,
chemicals
in
your
breath...
and
you
are
being
forced
as
a
protective
measure
in
appropriate
cases
to
disclose
any
drugs
you
may
be
taking
that
might
affect
the
test.
those
are
the
two
points
of
intrusiveness
that
are
crucial
for
you,
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
i
realize
the
question
of
justification
is
there,
too,
but
the
features
of
intrusiveness
which
are
crucial
to
you
are
the
disclosures
of
knowledge
which
in
effect
can
be
gained
either
from
your
admission
of,
or
your
disclosure
of
other
drug
use
and
the
testing
of
the
chemicals.
those
are
the
two
features.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
