anthony
m.
kennedy
thank
you.
mr.
anderson,
may
i
ask
you--
--what
would
a
circuit
court
judge
do
if
there
were
an
opinion
and
the
judgment
had
been
vacated
and
that
opinion
is
on
the
book?
is
that
the
law
of
the
circuit
in
the
ninth
circuit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
just
like
an
interesting
law
review
article
hanging
out
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--indicated
that
a
court
could
adopt,
say,
the
ninth
circuit,
a
rule
that
vacated
opinions
to
have
precedential
value,
so
even
though
you
might
prevail
in
a
subsequent
quasi
collateral
estoppel,
there
would
be
no
collateral
estoppel
but
you'd
lose
anyway
under
this
hypothetical
rule,
which
seems
to
me
a
very
strange
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
i'm
talking
about,
assume
you're
back
in
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you'd
give
the
same
answer
as
was
referenced
to
the
district
judge's
position
if
the
ninth
circuit
had
vacated
the
opinion
after
a
settlement
with
quite...
suppose
there's
a
settlement
while
the
case
is
on
rehearing
in
the
ninth
circuit,
no
certiorari
granted,
and
then
it's
vacated.
what
does
the
district
court
do
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right,
so
the
grant
of
certiorari
is
irrelevant.
