justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask...
you
see,
i'm
not
sure
your
argument
tracks
your
position
in
your
briefs...
is
it
your
position
that
there
should,
we
should
announce
a
general
rule
that
when
there's
a
settlement
there
will
always
be
a
vacation
of
the
judgment
below,
or
is
it
to
be
decided
on
a
casebycase
determination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
still
a
little
puzzled
as
to
what
you're
saying.
the
discretion
should
be
exercised
as
a
general
matter
to
vacate,
but
does
that
mean
that
we
should
adopt
a
rule
we
should
always
vacate
without
looking
at
the
particular
facts,
or
are
we
simply...
i
don't
quite
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it's
willing
to
pay
in
the
particular
case,
but
it
still
doesn't
like
the
general
rule
that
the
court
announced,
and
that's...
that...
i
really
don't
understand
your
position,
but
go
ahead.
may
i
ask
you
to
clarify
your
position
that
you
care
only
about
having
the
judgment
expunged?
the
judgment
doesn't
do
anything.
what
can
hurt
is
either
the
preclusive
effect
or
the
precedential
value,
so
what
does
it
mean
to
vacate
a
judgment
if
that
judgment
is
still
going
to
have,
if
the
opinion
is
going
to
have
precedential
value?
what
do
you
accomplish
by
vacating
the
bare
bottom
line
if
everything
else
is
retained?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
has
decided
the
case,
but
there's
a
petition
for
rehearing
pending?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
parties
settle,
that's
the
end
of
the
ball
game.
aren't
you,
in
effect,
asking
the
court
to
write
a
term
into
the
settlement
agreement
that
you
did
not
successfully
negotiate?
many
of
these
agreements
put
in
the
agreement
itself
that
a
term
of
the
settlement
is
that
the
decision
will
be
vacated.
here,
you're
asking
the
court,
in
effect,
to
put
in
as
a
term
of
the
settlement
what
the
opposing
party
and
you
didn't
negotiate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
in
that
regard,
this
case
settled
after
we
granted
the
certiorari,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
advised
the
court
it
had
become
moot.
did
you
make
a
motion
to
have
the
judgment
vacated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
moved
that...
you
filed
a
motion.
i
didn't
remember
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
i'm
not
sure
i
have
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question.
did
the
parties
file
briefs
on
the
issue
in
the
munsingwear
case,
or
did
the
court
just
dispose
of
it
by
explaining
what
it
was
doing?
do
you
know?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
not
a
case
that
became
moot
after
we
had
granted
certiorari?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
a
district
judge
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
we
follow
the
procedure
you
recommend,
and
the
same
issue
comes
up
that
this
panel
decided?
would
you
follow
the
opinion,
or
would
you
say
well,
it
doesn't
count,
if
you
were
a
district
judge?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
there
legislation
in
california,
though,
that
caused
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
say
they
distinguished
themselves,
too.
[laughter]
