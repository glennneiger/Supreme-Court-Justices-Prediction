justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
your
theory
that
it's
within
the
discretion
of
the
court
to
decide
whether
to
vacate
the
judgment
or
not,
if
the
court
were
to
decide
not
to
vacate
this
judgment
after
the
settlement,
is
that
an
abuse
of
the
court's
discretion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
just
leave
it
entirely
open
to
the
court
to
weigh
the
factors
one
way
or
another
and
decide
what
to
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
then,
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor
is
it
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
you
told
me
it
would
not
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
refuse
to
vacate.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
talk
about
a
court
of
appeals.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
it's
a
court
of
appeals
on
these
facts,
and
the
court
of
appeals
refuses
to
vacate
the
judgment.
is
that
an
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
a
practical
matter,
why
do
you
oppose
vacating
the
judgment
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
does
your
client
oppose
it?
what
use
do
you
anticipate
making
of
it?
