justice

bader

because
bonner
is
resisting
the
vacation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
understand
why
you're
in
a
different
position
from
somebody
who's
just
decided
to
forego
an
appeal,
why
we
should
treat
you
differently
from
someone
who
has
withdrawn
an
appeal,
or
decided
not
to
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
wouldn't
it
make
sense
just
for
us
to
dismiss
and
you
can
go
to
the
ninth
circuit
that
says
it
will
take
these
on
a
onebyone
basis,
move
under
60(b)
for
them
to
reopen
and
vacate
the
judgment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
it
didn't
grant
cert,
then
it
would
be
proper
just
when
you
have
the
settlement
to
dismiss
outright?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
fact
the
bottom
line
was
preclusion.
munsingwear,
the
holding
in
munsingwear
is
the
government
was
precluded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
on
the
way
to
holding
that
the
government
was
bound,
the
court
said,
en
passant,
but
if
the
government
had
done
this
we
would
have
followed
our
established
practice.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
when
the
winner
throws
in
the
towel,
when
the
winner
says
i'm
afraid
what
the
supreme
court
might
do
with
this,
so
i'm
giving
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
makes
it
a
condition...
then
they
have
a
settlement,
and
part
of
the
settlement
is
that
the
winner
is
going
to
give
up
that
victory,
so
that
the
case
is
not
decided
on
appeal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
doesn't
preclusion
apply
to
issues
of
law
as
well
as
of
fact?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
right.
so
why
couldn't
the
bank,
having
litigated
and
lost
this
issue,
be
taken
to
have
litigated
it
and
lost
it
against
all
the
world,
and
then
there
would
be
preclusion,
collateral
estoppel
with
respect
to
that
determination
of
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
in
this
very
case?
at
least
in
the
petitioner's
reply,
they
do
posit
this
settlement
falling
through
and
then
their
being
back
in
the
same
circumstance
and
again
the
new
value
issue
coming
up
in
this
very
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
could
live...
bonner
really
has
no...
the
decision
here
is
not
going
to
affect
bonner
one
way
or
another,
so
i
understand
you
really
to
be
arguing
as
a
friend
of
this
court,
because
we
asked
you
to
brief
the
issue.
i
see
the
issue
as
a
repeating
one
for
bancorp,
but
bonner
has
no
continuing
interest.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
bank
does
suggest
that
it's
possible
that
the
new
value
exception
will
again
become
an
issue
between
these
parties
if
the
plan
that's
now
on
the
table
isn't
confirmed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
there's
a
5-year
period,
and
if
it
doesn't
work
out,
it
may
be
back
to
square
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
are
arguing
this
as
kind
of
a
friend
of
the
court.
there's
no
interest
of
your
litigant
in
it.
