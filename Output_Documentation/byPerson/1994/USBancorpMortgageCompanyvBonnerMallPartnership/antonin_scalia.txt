justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you've
confused
me.
i
thought
you
just
told
the
chief
justice
you
didn't
care,
that
you
would
leave
that
to,
you
know,
for
another
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
you
do
care.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
your
position
is
that
it
has
not
precedential
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
one
frequently
sees
cases
cited
at
least
where
they
are
vacated
on
other
grounds.
you
cite
it
for
one
proposition,
you
know,
paren,
vacated
on
other
grounds,
and
that
seems
to
be
considered
proper
authority
so
long
as
the
vacatur
is
not
for
the
reason
cited.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
misdescription
of
what
had
happened?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
we
should
investigate
each
case
for
those
concerns,
have
a
minifactual
hearing
every
time
there's
a
motion
to
munsingwear
a
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
proper
answer
should
be,
you
know,
maybe,
maybe
not,
but
tough
luck?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
i
mean,
you
either
have
to
acknowledge
a
possibility
that
that
could
happen
now
and
then,
or
else
you're
going
to
have
to
say,
we're
going
to
have
to
conduct
these
inquiries.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
you're
right
that
we've
done
it
often,
but
almost
all
the
times
we've
done
it,
we've
done
it
by
way
of
a
per
curiam
opinion
or
summary
disposition.
in
fact,
in
think
munsingwear
is
the
only
case
i
recall
where
we've
discussed
the
reasons
for
it,
and
we
also
have
a
principle
that
in
matters
of
procedure
and
judicial
administration
stare
decisis
is
least
strong.
justice
antonin
scalia
has
the
issue
been
litigated
before,
as
far
as
you
know?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
this
is
really
the
first
time
we're
confronting
the
issue
in
an
adversary
context?
justice
antonin
scalia
--standing
up
and
arguing
both
sides
of
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
litigated
completely
in
munsingwear?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
parties
took
opposing
positions
on
the
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
have
you
ever
cited
a
case,
has
the
government
ever
cited
cases
in
a
brief
in
which
it
cites
a
case
as
authority
and
then
says,
parenthesis,
vacated
on
other
grounds?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
clear
that
the
petitioner
here
would
not
be
bound
by
the
decision
below
insofar
as
res
judicata
or
collateral
estoppel
effect
is
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
precedent
now.
i'm
talking
about,
strictly
speaking,
res
judicata
effect,
or
a
collateral
estoppel
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
understand.
but
without
the
vacatur,
would
there
be
such
an
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
that
happens?
is
your
position
that
even
if
the
parties'
settlement
agreement
provides
that
the
party
appealing
the
decision
below
shall
move
the
court
to
vacate
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
isn't
just
the
parties'
expectation
that
you're
asking
to
be
defended
here,
but
rather
the
integrity
of
the
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
victimless
situation,
you
suggest.
the
courts
are
the
victims.
justice
antonin
scalia
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
are
there
in
part
to
serve
the
interests
of
the
courts
not
to
have
to
redo
things
all
the
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
principle,
how
do
you
distinguish
other
cases
where
a
case
has
been
moot,
for
example,
by
the
death
of
one
of
the
parties?
you
don't
deny
that
we
have
authority
to
vacate
the
judgment
below
then.
what
is
your
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand,
but
i
mean,
i
need
some
conceptual
framework.
this
is
an
equitable
power
that
we
have,
and
in
that
case
there
is
an
equity
in
eliminating
the
decision
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
in
a
case
where
a
party
has
voluntarily
declined
to
pursue
his
legal
remedy,
there's
no
equity
in
relieving
him
of
the
judgment
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
people
that
have
been
operating
under
our
munsingwear
rule
and
have
bought
vacaturs
fair
and
square?
what
do
we
tell
them
now?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
originally,
petitioner
sought
review
of
the
ninth
circuit’s
decision
on
a
question
of
bankruptcy
law
but
after
we
agreed
to
hear
the
case
the
parties
reached
a
settlement
that
rendered
the
controversy
moot
and
of
course
terminated
our
jurisdiction
to
decide
it.
petitioner
requested
that
in
light
of
that
mootness,
we
not
leave
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
standing
but
that
we
exercise
our
statutory
power
under
28
u.
s.
c.
section
2106
to
vacate
it,
that
is
to
give
the
power
it's
a
anglo-latin
name
that
if
we
exercise
our
power
of
vacatur.
respondent
opposed
the
motion
and
we
held
the
case
over
from
last
term
to
consider
whether
appellate
courts
and
the
federal
system
should
vacate
civil
judgment
of
inferior
courts
in
cases
that
are
settled
after
appeal
is
filed
or
certiorari
is
sought.
in
a
unanimous
decision
we
hold
that
mootness
by
reason
from
settlement
does
not
justify
vacatur
of
a
judgment
on
the
review,
vacatur
is
an
equitable
remedy
traditionally
granted
to
parties
whose
efforts
to
obtain
the
view
have
been
forted
by
happenstance
or
by
the
unilateral
of
the
party
who
prevailed
in
the
lower
court.
when
mootness
results
from
settlement,
however
the
party
seeking
relief
from
the
judgment
has
voluntarily
forfeited
his
legal
remedy
by
the
ordinary
process
of
appealer
certiorari,
thereby
surrendering
his
claim
to
the
equitable
remedy
of
vacatur,
there
is
a
public
interest
concern
as
well,
congress
has
prescribed
a
primary
route
by
appeal
as
of
right
and
certiorari,
through
which
parties
may
seek
relief
from
the
legal
consequences
of
judicial
judgments
to
allow
parties
to
employ
vacatur
as
an
indirect
attack
on
the
judgment
disturbs
the
orderly
operation
of
the
federal
judicial
system
accordingly.
we
deny
petitioner’s
motions
of
vacate
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
and
we
dismiss
the
case
as
moot.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
