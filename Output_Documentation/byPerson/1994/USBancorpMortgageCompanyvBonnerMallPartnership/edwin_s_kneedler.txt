mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
since
this
court's
decision
in
munsingwear
and
indeed,
before
that
time,
this
court
has
followed
a
consistent
practice
of
vacating
decisions
of
the
lower
courts
that
have
become
moot
as
a
result
of
the
settlement
of
the
parties.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
judgments
should
be
vacated.
it
follows
from
that,
in
our
view,
that
the
precedential
impact
of
the
decision
is
also
eliminated.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
do
not.
one
of
the
important
points
the
court
made
in
munsingwear
itself
was
that
the
decision
should
be
vacated
in
order
to
prevent
it
from
spawning
any
legal
consequences,
and
those
legal
consequences
could
be
collateral
estoppel,
they
could
be
law
of
the
case,
but
they
can
also
importantly
be
the
precedential
impact
of
the
decision
in
other
cases.
so
it
is
an
important
aspect
of
the
vacatur
to
eliminate
the
precedential
impact
of
the
decision.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
several
points
i'd
like
to
make
in
response
to
that.
munsingwear
was
a
discussion
of
the
issue,
but
included
in
the
court's
discussion
in
munsingwear
where
the
court
announced
its
general
rule,
it
made
no
mention
of
the
word
happenstance.
the
court
referred
to
its
established
practice
when
a
case
becomes
moot,
and
cited
a
number
of
cases,
four
of
which,
as
is
pointed
out
in
footnote
5
of
petitioner's
brief,
involved
settlement.
so
the
court
was
recognizing
that
the
general
practice
that
it
had
already
established
at
the
time
of
munsingwear
applied
to
settlement,
so
there
was
no
need
to
separately
discuss,
no
need
on
this
court's
part
to
separately
discuss
how
that
rule
should
apply
to
settlement
because
the
court
was
already
relying
on
cases
that
involved
settlement,
and
that,
the
court's
following
of
that
practice
since
that
time
simply
confirms
that
there
has
been
a
general
rule.
the
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
court
should
now
depart
from
that
general
rule,
and
we
think
that
respondent
has
shown
no
reasons
for
doing
so.
the
problems
with
a
case--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
in
general
not.
i
think
the
party,
the
parties
have
recognized
the
consequence
that
mootness
leads
to
vacatur
of
the
decision
below.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
first
time
the
court
has
certainly
chosen
to
argue--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
but
my
point
is
that
in
munsingwear
itself
the
issue
was
litigated
completely,
and
at
that
time
the
court
was
relying
on
cases
that
involved
settlement,
and
the
court's
consistent
practice
since
then
has
showed
that
it
is
in
fact
a
settled
rule,
and
we
see
no
reason
to
depart
from
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
question
of
what
the
proper
disposition
of
a
lower
court
judgment
should
be
when
a
case
becomes
moot
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
did.
well,
in
munsingwear
the
issue
arose
afterward
when
the
united
states
tried
to
avoid
the
collateral
estoppel
consequences,
or
res
judicata
consequences
of
a
judgment
that...
where
the
appeal
was
dismissed
and
the
united
states
did
not
seek
to
have
that
judgment
vacated,
and
what
the
court
said
is,
to
prevent
that
from
happening,
the
government
should
have
sought
an
order
having
the
lower
court
decision
vacated,
and
the
court
referred
to
its
established
practice,
which
included
cases
that
had
been
settled.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
my
understanding
is
the
parties
filed
briefs
on
the
merits,
and
it
was
heard
on
certiorari.
it
was
not
disposed
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
the
case
became
moot
because
the
product
was
decontrolled
while
the
appeal
was
pending
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
the
appeal
was
dismissed
from
the
trial
court.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
appeal
from
the
trial
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
had
been
dismissed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
but
because
the
government
had
not
sought
to
have
the
judgment
vacated,
and
what
the
court
said
is
that
its
established
practice
had
been
that
if
the
government
had
sought
that
release,
it
would
have
been
granted.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
and
then
what...
the
court
has
continued
to
follow
its
established
practice
in
settlement
cases.
that's
the
point
that
i'm
making.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
described
the
inability,
or
the
lack
of
review
as
having
occurred
by
happenstance,
but
it
doesn't
appear
to
me
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
not
even
clear,
but
we
can
assume
for
the
moment
that
that's
correct.
i
think
the
court
could
have
been
just
saying
that
the
review
was
precluded
by
circumstances
beyond
the
court's
control,
but
the
important
point,
there
was
just
a
reference
in
one
sentence
to
the
word
happenstance,
but
when
the
court
stated
its
general
rule,
it
did
not
contain
the
word
happenstance
on
page
39
where
the
court
described
its
established
practice,
and
again
referred
to
cases
involving
settlement.
now,
to
depart
from
that
and
adopt
a
casebycase
rule
would
have
a
number
of
disadvantages.
it
would
take
this
court's
time
in
looking
at
the
facts
of
each
case
to
see
whether
vacatur
would
be
appropriate.
it
would
also
undermine
the
certainty
and
predictability
for
the
parties
in
entering
into
settlements
and,
indeed,
in
munsingwear
the
court
announced--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
opinion,
but
the
opinion
would
have
precedential
effect
only
because
of
the
judgment.
the
lower
courts,
like
this
court--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
precedent
comes
from
the
judgment
of
the
court
and
the
opinion
explaining
the
judgment,
and
the
extent
of
the
opinion
that's
necessary
to
the
judgment
becomes
precedent,
but
it
is
the
judgment
that
is
the
judicial
role,
it
is
the
judgment
that
settles
the
case
or
controversy,
and
therefore
the
judgment
that
is
binding
precedent
in
other
cases.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
citing
it
for
its
persuasive
force
if
it
is...
if
the
judgment
is
vacated
and
not
reinstated,
i
don't
think
it
has
binding
precedential
impact,
force.
we
would
cite
it
for
whatever
force
it
might
carry,
and
the
fact
that
it
was
overturned
by
a
higher
court
on
other
grounds
suggests
that
the
reasoning
might
be
particularly
persuasive,
but
would
not
be
binding.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
exactly.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
if
the
court,
if
the
district
court
found
it
persuasive,
it
could
follow
it,
but
the
point
is,
it
would
be
an
independent
act
of
judging
on
the
district
court's
part
to
decide
what
the
correct
result
was
without
having
that
answer
dictated
by
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
and
after
all,
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
was
rendered
tentative
at
best
by
virtue
of
this
court's
grant
of
certiorari,
and
it
seems
to
us
it
would
be
unwise
to
leave
a
decision
that
this
court
has
found
sufficient
reason
to
grant
review
and
perhaps
reversed,
standing
as
binding
precedent
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
not
free
the
parties
to
litigate
that
question
in
other
cases.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
would
be
the
same
thing,
if
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
just
indicates
from
the
perspective
of
this
court's
role,
this
court
sits
to
resolve
conflicts
or
to
resolve
differences
in
the
lower
courts,
and
in
this
case
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
on
the
new
value
exception
was
the
first
decision
after
this
court's
decision
in
northwest
bank
sustaining
the
new
value
exception.
it
would
be
consistent
with
this
court's
role
of
superintending
the
decisions
in
the
lower
courts
to
eliminate
that
precedent,
and
to
allow
the
issue
to
continue
to
percolate
in
the
lower
courts,
a
practice
which
this
court
has
recognized
is
of
considerable
benefit.
i'd
also
like
to
address
the
question
of
fairness.
the
rule
we
propose
is
consistent
with
the
role
of
the
courts.
the
rule
we
propose
is
consistent
with
the
role
of
the
courts
sitting
to
litigate
actual
controversies
between
parties,
and
not
to
announce
broader
principles
except
as
a
derivative
aspect
of
that
judicial
role,
and
there...
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
okay,
several
things.
the...
when
the
appellant
doesn't
dismiss
the
appeal,
the
appellant
is
still
seeking
review
of
the
judgment
below,
just
as
the
petitioner
does
here,
so
the
party
is...
it's
different
from
where
the
party
has
just
decided
to
let
the
lower
case
judgment
stand.
that's
the
first
thing.
the
second
thing
is
that
what
causes...
what
leads
the
court
to
vacate
the
judgment
is
not
the
agreement
of
the
party
to
vacate
the
judgment,
it's
the
agreement
of
the
party
that
settles
the
case
which
renders
the
case
moot.
it's
the
mootness,
then,
under
the
munsingwear
rule,
that
requires
vacatur.
the
third
and
last
point
that
i
wanted
to
make
is
where
the
vacatur
is
conditioned
upon
approval
of
the
court,
in
a
sense
the
case
may
not
yet
be
moot,
because
the
settlement
is
not
conclusive,
but
where--
