mr.
bradford
anderson
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
is
a
case
which
contains
within
the
question
presented,
as
set
forth
in
the
court's
march
28th
order,
a
much
more
narrowlyfocused
question,
and
that
question
is
whether
the
decision
below
should
be
vacated
when
after
this
court
granted
certiorari
the
parties
settled
and
mooted
the
case
before
this
court,
and
that
settlement
did
not
contain
any
agreement
or
condition
requiring,
or
for
that
matter
precluding
vacatur.
we
also
contend
for
a
rule...
a
more
general
application,
and
that
is
that
the
established
precedent
confirmed
in
the
munsingwear
decision
and
in
later
decisions
of
this
court
which
require
vacatur
upon
mootness,
that
those
decisions
be
generally
adhered
to
in
cases
where
mootness
arises
as
a
result
of
settlement.
and
because
that
is
the
established
practice
of
this
court,
we
believe
that
the
burden
should
be
on
the
respondent,
bonner,
to
demonstrate
why
that
practice
should
be
changed.
our
position
here
can
be
summarized
rather
succinctly
1)
in
a
case
like
this
one,
where
the
court
has
granted
review
so
that
the
decision
below
is
not
final
in
the
federal
statutory
scheme
and
therefore
there
is
no
presumption
of
correctness,
we
believe,
which
attaches,
vacatur
is
appropriate
generally
and
in
this
specific
case.
mr.
bradford
anderson
we
are
referring
to
what
in
essence
is
the
judgment
below.
we
do
not
contend,
as
has
been
suggested
by
bonner,
that
the
opinion
should
be
somehow
expunged
from
published
sources,
or
that
it
should
be
depublished
or
withdrawn.
what
we
are
addressing
is
the...
what
in
essence
is
the
judgment
below.
mr.
bradford
anderson
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
bradford
anderson
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
the
law
of
the
circuit,
your
honor.
the...
our
position
is,
and
i
think
it's
consistent--
mr.
bradford
anderson
--no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
would
be
not
comparable
to
a
law
review,
but
perhaps
comparable
to
the
decisions
that
we
have
found
in
the
seventh
circuit
on
this
same
new
value
exception
issue,
where
there
has
been
much
learned
discussion
about
the
issue,
most
of
it...
i
guess
all
of
it
in
dicta,
and
it
has
provided,
i
think,
a
useful
examination
of
the
issue
which
then
ultimately
goes
to
establish
the
basis
for
what
ultimately
will
become
the
precedent.
mr.
bradford
anderson
we
do
care.
mr.
bradford
anderson
but
we
would
leave
it
to
another
day,
your
honor,
although
we--
mr.
bradford
anderson
--that's
correct.
mr.
bradford
anderson
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
must
have
misinterpreted
your
question.
it
is
not
necessary
to
our
argument
here
today
that
a
determination
be
made
as
to
what
the
precedential
effect,
if
any,
of
vacatur
is.
mr.
bradford
anderson
they
could
have
such
a
rule,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that
is
the
case,
but
they
could
have
such
a
rule.
mr.
bradford
anderson
i
believe
that
could
be
the
case,
justice
scalia.
i
was
simply
stating
that
our
position
generally
is
that,
our
understanding
of
the
law
is
that
normally
a
vacated
decision
would
not
have
precedential
or
binding
effect
on
the
lower
courts.
mr.
bradford
anderson
we
would
contend,
your
honor,
that
the
mootness
to
the
extent
it
was
created
there,
was
created
by
the
unilateral
act,
and
that
the
reference
to
happenstance
by
the
court
in
munsingwear
was
not
a
description
of
what
had
happened,
but
was
rather
more
of
an
offhand
reference
to--
mr.
bradford
anderson
--possibly
a
misdescription
of
what
had
happened,
yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
as
you
know,
munsingwear
did
not
involve
directly
the
question
of
mootness.
the
question
before
the
court
in
that
case
was
whether
res
judicata
effect
should
have
been
given
to
the
judgment,
which
the
united
states
did
not
challenge
directly
below.
the
court
indicated
also
that,
had
the
united
states
moved
to
vacate
in
the
court
of
appeals,
that
it
would
have
been
entitled
to
that
relief.
mr.
bradford
anderson
well,
the
explanation,
your
honor,
i
think
is
reflected
in
the
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
after
munsingwear
was
decided.
there
are
at
least
a
dozen
decisions
in
which,
with
munsingwear
standing
there
as
precedent,
this
court
has
granted
vacatur
in
cases
where
mootness
came
about
as
a
result
of--
mr.
bradford
anderson
--yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
bradford
anderson
ultimately,
as
we
have
argued
in
our
briefs,
the
decision
whether
to
vacate
is
bottomed
on
discretion
by
this
court.
we
believe
that
that
discretion
is
appropriately
exercised
as
a
general
matter
in
cases
where
mootness
occurs
as
a
result
of
the
joint
action
of
the
parties
in
agreeing
to
a
settlement
where
the
prevailing
party
below
agrees
to--
mr.
bradford
anderson
--well,
there
may
be
circumstances,
justice
stevens,
where
the
court
would
have
to
look
at
the
particular
facts.
i
think
those
circumstances
would
be
unusual
and
perhaps
extraordinary.
for
example,
where
you
have
what
in
essence
might
be
a
sham
settlement,
or
where
the
parties
can
identify
a
pattern
of
abusive
settlements,
but
the
general
rule--
mr.
bradford
anderson
--because
ultimately
vacatur
is
premised
on
the
exercise
of
discretion
by
this
court,
and
the
interests
promoted
by
vacatur,
which
are
fairness
and
the
prudential
considerations
that
we
have
outlined,
would
not
be
promoted,
i
don't
think,
in
a
situation
where
the
settlement
was
in
fact
not
a
settlement.
for
example,
where
the
losing
party
below
essentially
pays
the
full
amount
of
the
judgment.
in
essence,
what
it's
saying
there
is
that
it
is
prepared
to
live
with
the
judgment,
it
is
prepared
to
comply
with
the
decision
below,
and
in
that
circumstance,
where
the
prevailing
party
below
has
not
made
any
concessions,
has
not
agreed
to
forego
reliance
on
that
lower
court
decision--
mr.
bradford
anderson
--well,
your
honor,
in
this
instance,
as
the
court
said
in
munsingwear,
one
of
the
purposes
of
vacatur
is
to
prevent
the
spawning
of
any
legal
consequences,
and
that
would
include
law
of
the
case.
and
in
this
particular
case,
the
bankruptcy
court
has
retained
jurisdiction,
the
consensual
plan
to
which
the
parties
agreed
is
to
be
implemented
over
a
period
of
5
years,
approximately,
it
is
to
prevent
collateral
estoppel
effects
flowing
from
that
judgment,
and
we
believe
that,
notwithstanding
the
respondent's
argument
there
are
collateral
estoppel
effects
that
might
flow
here
under
the
united
states
v.
mendoza
case
which
applies
collateral
estoppel
to
issues
of
law,
and
those--
mr.
bradford
anderson
--if
there
were
litigation
outside
the
ninth
circuit,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
would
be
the
case.
the
precedent
certainly
might
be
binding--
mr.
bradford
anderson
--we
would
be
in
that
situation.
the
precedent
would
be
then
binding
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
bradford
anderson
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
although
to
a
certain
degree,
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
there
is
a
merging
of
the
estoppel
effect
and
the
precedential
effect
within
the
confines
of
the
ninth
circuit,
and
only
within
those
confines.
mr.
bradford
anderson
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
the
court
may
exercise
that
discretion
in
any
way
it
seems
fit,
and
i
don't
believe
that
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
bradford
anderson
subject
to
the
general
rule
that
we
suggest
that
vacatur
upon
mootness
where
the
mootness
occurs
as
a
result
of
settlement
is
generally
appropriate
for
the
reasons
that
it
promotes
the
values
that
we
have
described
in
our
briefs...
fairness
between
the
parties,
and
the
prudential
concerns
that
the
judicial
system
must
have
with
regard
to
the
development
of
precedent.
mr.
bradford
anderson
in
this
particular
case?
mr.
bradford
anderson
i
don't
believe
there
would
be
any
grounds
for
refusing
to
vacate
in
this
case.
mr.
bradford
anderson
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question.
since
the
decisions
of
this
court
are
generally
not
reviewable,
i
wouldn't
think
that...
it
could
not
be
characterized
as
an
abuse
of
discretion.
[laughter]
mr.
bradford
anderson
i
think
there
are
some
differences
when
you
begin
to
talk
about
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor.
mr.
bradford
anderson
i
would
think
it
would
be.
i
would
think
it
would
be,
and
the
reason
is,
as
long
as
there
is
an
appeal
pending
so
that
that
decision
which
the
court
of
appeals
is
reviewing
is
not
final,
the
court
of
appeals
has
not
been
able
to
complete
its
review
of
that
decision,
then
the
judgment
should
be
vacated.
mr.
bradford
anderson
i
would
say
that
that
would
be,
the
same
rule
should
apply.
mr.
bradford
anderson
that
decision
is
not
final.
mr.
bradford
anderson
justice--
mr.
bradford
anderson
--bonner
is
resisting
it,
justice
ginsburg.
however,
it
was
not
a
term
that
was
negotiated.
we
do
not
believe,
however,
and
we
do
not
urge
that
that
be
a
distinguishing
consideration,
because
the
principles
underlying
vacatur,
fairness,
and
the
prudential
concerns
that
i
mentioned,
particularly
fairness
we
don't
believe
should
be
premised
on
the
relative
bargaining
power
of
the
parties.
fairness--
mr.
bradford
anderson
--well,
if
i
may
briefly
explain
some
of
the
factual
considerations
that
led
us
to
where
we
are
today,
i
think
that
will
answer
the
question.
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
parties
were
negotiating
prior
to
the
filing
of
the
bankruptcy
case
in
1991.
u.s.
bancorp
had
proposed
certain
settlement
terms
that
it
was
willing
to
live
with.
those
terms
included
very
basic
minimums
that
it
required,
a
market
rate
of
interest,
an
adequate
loantovalue
ratio,
things
of
that
nature.
those
terms
were
ultimately
what
was
accepted
by
bonner
in
january
of
1994
and
then
some
subject
to
certain
other
conditions
which
then
also
were
met
later
so
that
the
consensual
plan
could
be
confirmed
in
march
of
1994.
bonner
was
the
party
that
made
certain
concessions
and
decided
to
forego
reliance
on
the
decision
it
had
won
in
the
ninth
circuit.
u.s.
bancorp
did
not
exercise
unilateral
action.
when
you
look
at
the
facts
in
that
light,
i
think
what
you
see
is
that
u.s.
bancorp
was
in
the
position
of
having
to
choose
in
this
dilemma
whether
to
accept
an
economic
settlement
which
was
favorable
on
its
terms
or
having
to
defend
a
decision,
or
to
challenge
a
decision
in
the
ninth
circuit
which
the
prevailing
party
was
no
longer
willing
to
litigate
and
was
willing
to
forego,
so
it
is
not
unilateral
action
in
that
sense
at
all.
i
think
also
that
the
fact
that
this
court
granted
certiorari
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
salient
elements
of
this
particular
case.
another
salient
element
is
that
the
settlement
which
i
briefly
described
was
a
bona
fide
settlement.
there's
no
issue
in
this
particular
case
of
collusion.
there's
no
issue
of
a
deep
pocket
attempting
to
purchase
vacatur
in
this
case.
so
those
concerns
which
have
been
raised
by
the
respondent
simply
do
not
apply.
mr.
bradford
anderson
i
do
not,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
the
general--
mr.
bradford
anderson
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
bradford
anderson
i
believe
it
could
happen
now
and
then
in
the
extraordinary
circumstances
that
i
alluded
to
earlier
as
a...
if
the
general
rule
which
we
propose
is
adopted,
i
don't
believe
it
would
be
necessary
for
the
court
to
engage
in
those
kinds
of
inquiries.
mr.
bradford
anderson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
bradford
anderson
yes,
we
did,
your
honor.
mr.
bradford
anderson
in
our
reply
to
the
memorandum
filed
by
the
respondent
suggesting
mootness.
mr.
bradford
anderson
yes,
your
honor,
and
we
requested
application
of
the
munsingwear
result.
going
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
as
a
factual
matter,
u.s.
bancorp
at
the
time
the
settlement
was
being
negotiated
in
fact
relied
on
what
it
believed
was
the
existing
precedent
in
this
court.
mr.
bradford
anderson
well,
i
think
the
fact
that
this
court
has
granted
certiorari,
your
honor,
indicates
that
it
should
be
this
court
that
vacates
the
judgment
for
the
reasons
that
the
grant
of
certiorari
by
itself
in
a
way
is
like
creating
a
doubt
about
that
precedent.
although
that
precedent
is
now
binding
in
the
ninth
circuit,
it
forever
will
have
this
question
mark
attached
to
it
as
to
the
review
which
was
granted
by
this
court
and
which
was
not
able
to
be
completed
as
a
result
of
the
settlement
of
the
parties.
mr.
bradford
anderson
that
may
be
the
correct
result,
your
honor.
we
would
urge
that
this
court
adopt
explicitly,
if
it
has
not
already,
the
velsicol
procedure
that
was
proposed
by
the
solicitor
general,
and
so
that
if
the
court...
if
the
matter
were
certworthy
at
that
time,
the
court
could
make
the
determination
that
vacatur
was
appropriate,
even
if
certiorari
had
not
been
granted
by
the
time
the
parties
settled.
finality,
then,
is
one
of
the
key
considerations
that
we
believe
direct
or
would
require
vacatur
in
this
particular
case.
i
wanted
to
distinguish
this
case
from,
i'm
sure,
the
decision
that
will
be
relied
upon
by
the
respondent,
and
that
is
the
karcher
v.
may
case.
in
that
case,
the
court
was
not
dealing
with,
even
with
mootness,
and
not
directly
dealing
with
vacatur.
in
that
case,
the
parties
who
were
named
in
the
petition
had
lost
their
position
as
legislators
in
new
jersey,
and
the
court
found
that
they
did
not
have
standing
to
assert
any
longer
the
position
that
they
had
been
asserting,
and
that
therefore
the
appeal
was
dismissed
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
the
reference
to
happenstance
in
that
case
was
simply
to
the
argument
of
those
parties
that
their
loss
of
position
was
a
matter
of
happenstance.
the
court
pointed
out
that,
in
fact,
the
statutes
in
place
in
new
jersey
at
that
time
were
specifically
intended
to
avoid
mootness.
