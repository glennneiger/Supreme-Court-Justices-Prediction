mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
we
argue
that
this
court
should
not
extend
munsingwear
to
mandate
routine
vacatur,
or
any
kind
of
stipulated
reversal
upon
settlement.
we
argue
that
such
vacatur
would
erode
certainty,
it
would
allow
for
the
manipulation
of
courts,
including
judge
and
forum
shopping,
and
would
directly
challenge
this
court's
longheld
belief
in
the
fundamental
importance
of
stare
decisis.
public
confidence
in
our
judicial
system
would
be
undermined
if
decisions
could
be
bought
and
sold
at
will,
and
the
only
settlements
that
would
be
promoted
by
such
a
rule
as
the
government
proposes
would
be
in
the
rare
but
important
cases
where
the
court's
future
the
court
decisions'
future
impact
and
future
results
that
a
party
might
suffer
has
a
present
monetary
value
to
one
of
the
parties.
i
would
suggest
that
these
impacts
and
these
results
go
far
beyond
even
the
broadest
possible
reading
of
munsingwear,
which
the
government
does
in
its
proposal.
we
suggest
a
better
rule
that
is
short
and
simple
in
its
application
no
vacatur
upon
settlement.
we
believe
this
rule
not
only
properly
follows
karcher
v.
may,
but
it
limits
vacatur
to
its
proper
place,
an
equitable
rule
that
is
discussed
in
munsingwear,
and
when
mootness
is
due
to
circumstances
beyond
the
parties'
control,
it
is
unfair
to
apply
preclusion
and
collateral
estoppel
to
those
parties
in
that
dispute.
that
would
be
the
only
circumstance
where
routine
vacatur
should
occur,
is
when
you
have
the
situation
of
happenstance.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
well,
in
that
situation,
i
don't
think
that
would...
if
the
winner
caves
in
during
the
appellate
process,
i
don't
think
that
in
any
way
moots
the...
well,
you're
saying
if
he
just
pays
the
judgment,
or
does
the...
does
whatever
the
other
party
requests.
then
no,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
grounds
to
vacate
the
court
decisions
below,
because
the
parties
are
getting
everything
they
wanted
in
that
circumstance,
justice
ginsburg.
they've
received
every...
if
the
winning
party,
our
party
in
this
particular
case,
throws
in
the
towel,
then
the
other--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--well,
then
i
think
you're
getting
right
back
into
a
stipulated
vacatur
situation,
not
as
in
the
record
of
this
case,
but
on
the
record
of,
for
instance,
the
izumi
situation,
where
you
have...
as
soon
as
you
go
down
that
road,
you're
getting
to
a
stipulated
vacatur
between
the
parties,
and
that
is
not
an
external
cause,
or
an
external
grounds
that
i
believe
would
justify
vacatur
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
well,
i
don't
disagree
that
that
was
a
situation
where
there
was
a
loss
of
standing,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
i
do
argue
that
there
is
no
effective
difference
between
the
appellant
in
karcher
simply
declining
to
proceed
to
go
any
further
and
a
situation
here
where,
as
a
result
of
the
settlement
agreement
between
bonner
mall
and
u.s.
bank,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
the
appellant
in
a
lower
appellate
court
situation,
simply
declines
to
go
any
further.
i
don't
believe
there
is
any
effective
difference,
because
in
both
situations
you
end
up
with
a
dismissal.
you
end
up
with
a
dismissal
of
the
appeal.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
no,
there
was
nothing
consensual
in
not
having
any
standing,
but
when
the
appeal
ends,
there
was
no
reason
to
go
back
down
and
vacate
the
lower
court
opinions,
so
in
that
situation
i
think
that's
the
same
result
you
gain
in
this
particular
case,
where
the
bank
makes
a
conscious
decision
that
as
part
of
the
settlement,
or
by
settling,
by
their
act
of
settling
they
moot
the
appeal.
i
think
the
effect
is
the
same.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
is.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--your
honor,
we
oppose
vacatur
in
this
setting,
in
the
post
mootness,
essentially
motion
before
this
court
for
vacatur.
it
was
no
part
of
our
bargain.
i
must
concede
to
you
that
my
client
in
this
particular
case
has
no
future
interest
as
a
result
of
this
settlement,
any
more
than
in
this
particular
case
the
bank
has
no
future
interest
in
this
particular
settlement.
they
have
an
interest,
as
they've
conceded
in
their
brief,
that
they
want
to
be
able
to
relitigate
the
issue
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
perhaps
their
companions
elsewhere
wish
to
do
the
same
in
other
circuits,
but
it
is
true
that
our
party
has
no
identifiable
interest
in
vacating
a
particular
judgment,
particularly
in
this
situation
where
it
was
a
pure
issue
of
law
from
the
ground
up,
if
you
will,
from
the
bankruptcy
court
decision
all
the
way
up.
it
made
no
specific
findings
of
fact.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
your
honor,
we
agree
with
the
government
in
one
respect,
that
if
the
court
grants
the
vacatur
in
this
situation,
it
takes
away
the
precedential
and
preclusive
effects
of
the
decisions
below.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
i
think
it
would
have
to
dispute
of
those,
too,
if
there
was
a
vacatur.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
i
don't
believe
there
would
be
true
collateral
estoppel
because
it
was
a
pure
issue
of
law.
i
believe
there
would
be
res
judicata
effect--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--yes,
they
do,
your
honor.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
mendoza
would
go
so
far
as
to
preclude...
if
this
court
vacates
the
rulings
below,
as
far
as
they
want
them
to
have
vacated,
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
have
a
preclusive
effect
in
another
case
in
another
state
by
a
u.s.
bank
from
raising
a
pure
issue
of
law
of
whether
that
applies.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
well,
certainly
i
think
in
that
situation
you
would
have
the
result
that
vacatur
would
allow
them
to
argue
the
legal
issue
again
and
respond,
as
they
have
responded
in
argument,
that
the
precedential
value
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
was
only...
well,
it
really
becomes
advisory
only,
no
different
than
any
other
kind
of
persuasive
authority.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
if
you
had
an
issue
of
fact,
then
i
think
it
would
have
binding
res
judicata
effect.
i
don't
think
there's
any
que...
the--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure
if
i
understand
that
particular
point.
i
think
that
in
a
question
of
fact
there
would
clearly
be
binding
res
judicata
effect.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
there
should
be
no
way.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
they
did
not
have
to
settle,
but
in
addition
to
that,
there
are
no
extrinsic
grounds
to
vacate
the
lower
court
decision.
there
would
be
no
unfairness
when
the
parties
to
a
settlement
have
essentially
contracted...
they've
contracted
their
own
res
judicata,
and
they
don't
really
have
any
needful
concerns
over
what
the
prior
rulings
were
below,
because
they've
already
reached
agreement.
the
only
difference
to
that,
of
course,
is
in
a
situation
where
they
have
actually
contracted
with
the
vacatur,
and
while
i
concede
that
that's
not--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--well,
that
was
precisely
the
case
in
izumi,
and
i
think
that
really
is
even
worse.
i
concede,
justice
scalia,
that
my
client
is
a
business
person.
they
would
have
accepted
a
monetary
offer
at
some
level,
just
as
windmere
did
in
izumi,
to
contract
out
of
the
court
decision.
that
very
well
could
have
happened
if
the
offer
had
been
made
and
accepted,
and
i
think
that
is
the
strongest
argument
against
vacatur
upon
settlement,
is
because
it
clearly
allows
for
the
purchase
of
precedent,
even
though
that
is
not
the
circumstance
in
this
case.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
well,
absolutely,
justice
scalia,
because
to
make
that
a
part
of
a
bargain,
it's
no
more
proper
in
that
circumstance
to
be
able
to,
for
us
to
be
able
to
sell
the
precedential
value
of
that
opinion
than
for
the
bank
to
be
able
to
purchase
it.
that
is
simply
a
contract
that
should
not
be
allowed
to
be
made
when
the
result
is
going
to
be
the
vacation,
in
this
case,
of
binding
circuit
precedent.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
i
do
take
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
the
government's
position,
and
i
believe--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--no,
it
is
not...
the
peti...
well,
i
disagree
with
you
there,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
i
think
the
bank
wants
it
both
ways.
they
argue,
as
phillips
did,
that,
well,
it
could
be
precedent
if
someone
wants
to
consider
it
precedent,
but
maybe
it
is
or
maybe
it
isn't.
they're
really
not...
because
they
clearly
want,
as
a
motivation
here,
to
remove
that
precedent
from
the
ninth
circuit.
it
does
nothing
for
the
bank
to
relieve
the
judgment
relieving
stay
at
the
trial
level.
that
is...
that's
beyond
any
contemplation
of
any
parties.
the
only
motivation
that
they
would
have
is
to
destroy
the
precedential
impact.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
say
there
should
never
be
vacatur.
i
believe
that
vacatur
is
entirely
appropriate
under
the
munsingwear
situation,
where
there
is
a
change
in
the
law,
where
there
is
a
party,
perhaps,
who
is
subject
to
an
injunction
who
dies,
and
therefore
there
is
no
successor
party.
in
those
circumstances
where
there
is
external
cause,
vacatur
as
an
equitable
doctrine
under
munsingwear
is
appropriate.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
well,
i
don't
agree
that
there
was
vacatur
in
mun...
i
think
munsingwear
was
prospective
in
that
respect.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
but
in
answer
to
that
question,
you've
got
the
unique
situation
of
the
government
where
they're
making
laws
and
they're
enforcing
laws,
and
i
think
in
that
particular
situation
it
was
merged.
the
legislative
or
administrative
section
of
government
changed
the
regulation,
and
the
council
responsible,
or
the
department
responsible
for
enforcement
therefore
lost
its
rights.
i
believe
that's
an
external
cost.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
no.
that's
not
an
external
situation.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
well,
i
believe
in
that
circumstance
it
will
not
be
a
difficult
or
burdensome
rule
for
this
court
or
for
any
circuit
court
of
appeals
or
for
that
matter
district
court
to
determine
that
happenstance
standard
if
the
law
governing
the
dispute
that
everybody
is
relying
on
changes,
which
is
the
situation
in
munsingwear,
than
that
is
an
appropriate
grounds
and,
we
argue,
the
only
appropriate
grounds
for
vacatur.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
would
point--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
a
unique
situation,
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
breyer,
where
it
wouldn't
affect
third
parties,
because
there
would
be
no
reason
for
that
party
to
need
vacatur,
and
what
you're
describing
is
the
exact
situation
in
phillips.
phillips
bought
itself
a
new
judge
and
a
new
district,
essentially
was
blessed
with
forum
shopping
by
obtaining
vacatur
of
the
original
district
court
decision,
which
was
just
a
jury
verdict.
it
was
not
ninth
circuit
precedent.
it
was
a
jury
verdict
and
a
denial
of
a
motion
for
new
trial,
which
was
pending
before
the
federal
circuit.
now
they
can
get
around
that
finding,
litigate
what
they
concede
is
the
identical
issue
in
illinois
in
the
hopes
of
getting
a
different
result,
and
i
would
argue
that's
precisely
the
type
of
relitigation
that
every
court
in
the
federal
system,
including
this
one,
has
a
vested
interest
in
avoiding.
why--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--i
think
the
courts
are
the
victims.
i
think
there
are--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--well,
that's...
yes,
and
i
think
in
the
phillips
situation,
i
think
that's
perhaps
the
clearest
example,
is
that
we
know...
we
don't
have
to
speculate
on
this
broad
question
of
whether
vacatur
promotes
settlements
or
doesn't
promote
settlements.
we
know
in
that
situation
phillips
has,
for
57
million
dollars,
bought
the
right
to
relitigate
the
issue
in
illinois
and
pretty
much
as
many
times
as
they
want,
if
they
have
other
defendants
on
the
same
issue,
and
in
this
case,
what
the
bank
is
asking
for,
and
it's
in
their
brief,
is
they
believe
there
is
a
tangible
benefit
to
be
gained
by
really
starting
a
relitigation
of
the
new
value
rule
in
the
ninth
circuit
all
over
again
from
the
settlement
table
to
the
bankruptcy
court
to
either
the
bap
or
the
district
court
level
and
all
the
way
up
to
the
circuit.
if
there
was
no
need
to
get
rid
of
the
binding
precedent,
there
would
be
no
need
for
them
to
move
to
vacate.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
what's
wrong
with
it--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--i
think
in
the
terms
of
the
district
court,
the
res
judicata
and
collateral
estoppel
are
the
important
reasons
not
to
do
that,
because
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
determine.
justice
breyer,
you
mentioned
in
response
to
the
other
question
that
you
believe
the
appropriate
circuit
practice
is
to
remand
questions
of
vacatur
to
the
court
that
decided
it.
i'm
not
necessarily
opposed
to
such
a
rule,
but
i
think
that
rule
is
always
leaving
open
the
question.
parties
have
rights
under
rule
60(b).
they
can
go
in
and
make
a
case,
and
in
general...
generally,
60(b)
is
a
pretty
tough
standard
to
meet
with
a
trial
judge,
and
i
don't
think
the
mere
settlement
of
the
parties
saying
x
has
bought
y's
opposition
to
a
vacatur
so
vacate
should
be,
in
and
of
itself,
a
60(b)
grounds,
but
we
could
live
with
a
rule
that
would
at
least
allow
the
court
that
made
the
decision
be
the
court
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
vacate.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
i
concede
that,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
bonner
has
no
continuing
action,
or
no
continuing...
they
had
no
reason
to
agree
to
a
vacatur,
but
they
had
no
future
interest,
nor,
i
believe,
does
the
bank
have
any
future
interest,
other
than
a
desire
to
change
the
law
in
this
case
nonlegislatively.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
well,
the
plan
was...
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--right.
in
5
years
the
bank
has
to
be
paid
in
full.
it
would
be
difficult,
under
the
stipulated
consensual
plan...
it
would
be
virtually...
i
would
say
it
would
be
impossible
for
bonner
to
again
invoke
the
new
value
exception
under
those
circumstances,
other
than--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--only
the
remotest.
i
have
to
concede
this
is
more
in
the
nature
of
a
friend
of
the
court.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
i
would
argue
that
the
idea
or
the
concept
of
evading
precedent,
or
evading
preclusion,
as
a
grounds
for
vacatur,
is
a
recent
phenomenon.
i
would
argue
that
at
the
time
of
munsingwear,
and
in
the
summary
treatment
that
this
court
has
given
munsingwear
since
its
enactment,
that
litigants
frankly
did
not
see
the
possibility
of
being
able
to
buy
a
court
decision,
being
able
to
use
a
procedure
that
is...
if
one
reads
munsingwear
really
has
no
application.
but
seeing
that
in
the
circuits
as
well
as
this
court
munsingwear
seemed
to
be
an
automatic
rule
for
disposition
of
cases,
this
presented
an
opportunity.
only
in
the
last
10
years
and,
really,
to
a
great
amount
only
in
the
last
5
years,
have
the
circuits
had
before
them
situations
which
it
is
clear
that,
for
instance,
in
the
oklahoma
city
case
the
government
is
coming
in
and
buying
a
decision.
in
the
phillips
case,
phillips
is
coming
in
and
buying
a
decision.
in
the
other
cases
decided
in
the
second
circuit,
where
they
did
make
a
distinction
between
appellate
opinions
and
district
court
judgments,
again
in
the
manufacturers
hanover
case
just
in
the
past
yearandahalf
the
concern
is
there
that,
if
you
allow
routine
vacatur
upon
settlement,
whether
or
not
you're
presented...
whether
you're
ever
presented
with
anything
other
than
a
notice
by
the
parties,
or
whether
you're
presented,
as
they
were
in
oklahoma
city,
with
a
joint
motion
contemplating
vacatur,
in
either
of
those
circumstances,
every
circuit
other
than
the
federal
circuit
that
had
to
address
vacatur
upon
settlement
in
recent
times
have
said,
this
is
not
a
munsingwear
situation.
this
is
not
happenstance.
this
has
the
potential
for
abuse.
it
has
the
potential
for
manipulation
of
precedent.
it
has
a
potential
for
people
being
able
to
purchase
decisions.
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
i
think
the
death
of
a
party
is...
it's
clearly
not
a
voluntary
act
of
that
party--
[laughter]
--and
it's
not--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--i
think...
i
would
argue,
justice
scalia,
that
that's
what
munsingwear
in
fact
does
provide,
is
equitable
grounds.
i
don't
believe
munsingwear
is
grounded
in
article
iii.
i
believe
it
is
in
equitable
grounds.
we
have
the
doctrine
of
collateral
estoppel.
if
you
follow
the
results,
without
vacatur,
of
this
case,
there
will
be
unfairness,
because
an
outside
occurrence
occurred,
whether
it
is
the
death
of
a
party,
or
the
change
of
a
law,
or
the
modification
of
an
icc
regulation,
and
that
sort.
that
is--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--no,
and
i
would
argue
that
that
is
the
finding
in
karcher,
is
that
voluntary
termination
makes
no
effective
difference.
i
would
further
like
to
argue,
and
argue
in
conclusion,
that
the
decision
of
a
court,
this
court
under
these
circumstances
or
any
other
court,
is
a
decision.
i
don't
believe
you...
that
it
can
be
avoided
that
this
is
a
decision,
it
is
a
ruling.
i
do
agree
with
the
government
that
it
does,
a
vacatur
does
specifically
vacate
precedent.
i
don't
know
how
the
terms
vacating
can
do
anything
with
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
but
to
vacate
precedent
and
relegate
it
to
arguable
authority.
without
happenstance,
without
this
extrinsic
event,
this
outside
event,
the
decision
that
any
court
makes
in
a
vacatur
situation
is
made
in
a
vacuum.
there
are
no
grounds
presented.
there's
no
reasoning
presented.
there
has
still
been
no
articulate
reasoning
of
why
the
court
should
vacate
by
the
bank,
other
than
the
ninth
circuit
might
have
been
wrong,
we
couldn't
find
out,
so
there
should
be
an
asterisk
by
the
decision
that
renders
it
not
as
precedent
in
the
case.
and
you
would
be
really
in
a
situation
of
destroying
existing
parties...
you
couldn't
avoid
destroying
existing...
excuse
me.
you
couldn't
avoid
destroying
existing
court
decisions
without
it
being
on
the
whim
of
the
parties
if
you
adopted...
if
you
extend
munsingwear
the
way
the
government
proposes
to
do
it,
which
will
be
an
automatic
vacatur.
it
wouldn't
be
practical
for
this
court
to
have
vacatur
hearings.
the
better
rule
is
simply
to
determine
if
it's
happenstance
that
should
be
apparent,
and
it's
moot.
if
it's
not,
dismiss
the
appeal.
if
they
have
grounds,
if
the
losing
party
below
has
grounds
to
go
to
the
circuit,
60(b)-type
grounds,
or
go
to
the
district
court,
they're
not
foreclosed
by
the
refusal
of
this
court
to
vacate.
the
parties
can--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
they've
bought
it
fair
and
square,
because
they're
really...
the
rulings
that
have
followed
munsingwear
from
this
court
have
been
summary
dispositions,
first
of
all.
second
of
all,
the
distinction
was
raised
in
karcher,
and
third,
in
the
various
circuits,
right
now,
as
we
stand
here,
in
the
various
circuits
in
either
a
majority,
or
nearly
a
clear
majority
of
the
circuits,
munsingwear
is
specifically
limited
to
happenstance.
the
courts
now,
with
the
second
and
tenth
circuit,
are
saying
this.
even
the
california
supreme
court,
which
has
been
truly
the
champion
of
vacatur,
just
last
week
backed
away
and
vacated
an
appellate
court
decision
in
a
per
curiam...
i
mean,
refused
to
vacate
an
appellate
court
decision
in
a
per
curiam--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--no,
because
governor
wilson
just
vetoed
that
legislation
just
in
the...
that
and
the
supreme
court's
decision
just
last
week.
i
don't
have
the
cite
on
it
yet.
i
just
have
the
reporting
of
it.
in
that
case,
after
pronouncing
neary,
they
distinguished
themselves,
or
they
distinguished
an
appellate
decision
from
neary.
in
other
words,
they
were--
mr.
john
ford
elsaesser,
jr.
--well,
they
wanted
to
draw
that
line
between
appellate
courts
and
trial
courts,
and
i
don't
know
if
that's
a
line
that
really...
really
can
be
effectively
drawn.
i
think
60(b)
can
take
care
of
what
the
litigant's
problems
are
in
the
federal
court.
i
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
thank
your
honors.
