justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
perhaps...
this
is
what
we
would
have
done,
i
think,
in
the
court
of
appeals.
imagine...
we're
out,
i
think.
that's
all
right.
answer
justice
breyer's...
go
ahead.
well,
it's
going
to
be...
well,
imagine
two
parties
had
agreed
that
the
settlement
is
conditional
upon
vacating
the
judgment
below.
i,
as
a
court
of
appeals
judge,
would
have
sent
the
whole
thing
back
to
the
district
judge
to
make
a
decision
about
that.
and
the
reason
i
would
have
had
him
do
that
is
there
are
not
many,
but
there
are
quite
a
few
complex
litigations
involving
cleaning
up
the
boston
harbor,
for
example,
or
managing
mental
health
facilities,
for
example,
and
the
vacating
of
a
judgment
might
have
significant
implications
on
lots
of
other
parties
to
the
mental
health
litigation
or
the
cleanuptheharbor
litigation,
and
might
have
changed
their
whole
strategy
were
something
like
that
to
come
up,
or
might
have
all
kinds
of
implications
that
only
the
district
court
would
know
about.
therefore,
even
had
they
agreed
on
the
settlement,
i
would
have
sent
it
back
to
get
the
district
court's
determination
about
how
it
affects
third
parties.
now,
where
i
don't
even
have
that
agreement,
i
would
worry
about
a
rule
that
said,
automatically
vacate,
for
the
reason
i
don't
know
what
counts
as
a
settlement.
an
appellant
may
simply
stop.
is
that
a
settlement?
moreover,
99
percent
of
the
time,
the
appellant
won't
bother
to
ask
for
the
vacating
of
the
judgment,
so
sometimes
it's
there,
sometimes
it's
not
there.
people
later
on
come
in
and
argue
about
the
significance
of
that.
it
sounds
complicated.
so
that
was
my
reaction
when
i
read
the
brief.
i'm
not
saying
that's
what
i'm
actually
thinking,
but
i
wanted
to
know
how
you
see
this
as
working
out
according
to
your
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
i
mean,
there
are
about
50,000
appeals
every
year
in
the
federal
system,
and
i
take
it
you
want
the
same
rule
for
appeals
as
for
the,
as
when
the
supreme
court's
involved,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
50,000
cases
are
coming
up,
and
most
of
them
involve
legal
issues
not
of
tremendous
significance,
and
all
these
decisions
are
written
by
district
judges
who
may
be
writing
quickly,
may
have
just
a
couple
of
sentences.
and
if
somebody
on
the
appeal
says,
i'm
not
going
to
abandon
this
further,
but
i'm
worried
about
the
collateral
estoppel
effect,
so
the
two
parties
agree
that
they
will
settle
the
matter
provided
they
get
rid
of
that
collateral
estoppel,
what's
wrong
in
the
ordinary
case
from
permitting
that
agreement
to
take
effect,
assuming
it
has
no
major
implications
for
third
parties
and
isn't
in
complicated
litigation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
i'm
asking
is,
i'm,
let
me
say
what
the
case
in
front
of
me
i'm
thinking
of.
a
very
large
proportion
of
our
appeals
concern
matters
of
fact.
what
are
the
underlying
facts
of
the
contract?
what
happened
in
the
auto
accident?
lots
of
them
are
that
way,
and
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
if
in
a
factbased
appeal,
which
comprises
a
very
large
percentage,
the
parties
are...
they
want
to
settle,
but
they're
worried
about
the
collateral
estoppel
effect
of
factfinding,
for
example,
so
they
say,
we'll
settle
it
if
you
vacate
the
judgment
below.
it's
an
auto
accident.
nobody
else
is
involved,
just
these
parties.
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
one
thing
is
you
could
say,
which
is
a
reasonable
point,
that
well,
the
court
is
somehow
involved
and
is
a
kind
of
a
victim.
i've
got
that.
is
there
anything
else?
is
that
the
only
consideration,
or
are
there
others?
