we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-714,
u.s.
bancorp
mortgage
company
v.
bonner
mall
partnership.
mr.
anderson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
anderson,
when
you
say
vacatur,
are
you
referring
just
to
the
judgment
below,
or
are
you
referring
also
to
the
opinion,
if
there
was
an
opinion
below?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
would
leave
it
to
some
other
rule
or
set
of
rules
to
decide
whether
the
opinion
should
continue
to
have
precedential
value
in
the
circuit,
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought
you
answered
just
the
opposite
to
me
a
moment
ago.
you
said
the
vacatur
would
not
cover
the
opinion,
but
only
the
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
reason
why,
say,
the
ninth
circuit
couldn't...
consistent
with
your
position
why
the
ninth
circuit
couldn't
have
a
rule
that
said,
even
though
a
judgment
of
our
court
which
has
been
vacated
pursuant
to
munsingwear,
nonetheless
we
will
continue
to
regard
our
opinion
in
that
case
as
a
circuit
precedent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
anderson.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
talking,
then,
not
just
about
judgments,
you're
talking
about
opinions
also?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
agree,
then,
with
your
colleague
who
just
spoke?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
munsingwear,
though,
the
court
says
the
established
practice
has
been
to
reverse
or
vacate
the
judgment
below
and
remand
with
a
direction
to
dismiss,
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
say
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
elsaesser,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
elsaesser,
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago
karcher
v.
may.
do
you
disagree
with
your
opponent's
characterization
of
that,
that
it
was
simply
a
loss
of
standing
on
the
parties
who
were
prosecuting
the
appeal
to
appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
certainly
in
karcher
v.
may
there
was
nothing
consensual
about
it
as
to
the
party
who
was
seeking
to
appeal,
but
it
was
said
to
have
no
standing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
effect
may
be
the
same.
the
procedure
is
certainly
quite
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
elsaesser,
you
take
it
as
a
given,
i
guess,
that
if
there
is
a
vacatur
it
is
not
just
of
the
judgment
but
of
the
opinion
as
precedent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
the
government's
position.
i
don't
think
it's
the
petitioner's
position.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
that
there
should
never
be
vacatur?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why,
then
why
should
there
have
been
vacatur
in
munsingwear,
where
in
effect
the
government
caused
the
change
which
resulted
in
the
case
becoming
moot?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
the
bank
here
say,
you
know,
that
our
mortgage
loan
department
made
this
decision,
but
i'm
the
general
counsel,
i
don't
want
to
be
bound
by
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
it
be
external
with
respect
to
the
government?
the
party
is
the
united
states
of
america,
which
represents
both
the
legislature
and
the
executive
branch.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we're
indebted
to
you
for
doing
that.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
elsaesser.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
number
93-714
u.s.
bancorp
mortgage
company
v.
bonner
mall
will
be
announced
by
justice
scalia.
