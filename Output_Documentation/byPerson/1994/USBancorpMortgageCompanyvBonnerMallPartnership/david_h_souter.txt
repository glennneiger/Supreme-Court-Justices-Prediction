mr.
anderson,
may
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question
about
munsingwear?
do
you
think
we
should
read
munsingwear
as
a
case
in
which
the
mootness
was
the
result
of
happenstance,
which
was
the
word
used
in
the
opinion,
or
should
we
read
that
as
a
case
in
which
the
mootness
or
the
underlying
mootness
resulted
from
the
acts,
the
unilateral
act
of
one
party,
and
hence
creating
the
mootness?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
court
in
munsingwear
did
not
view
it
the
way
you
have
just
described
it?
what
was
the
point
of
talking
about
happenstance,
and
happenstance
alone,
if
it
viewed
it
your
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
yes,
but
we're
now
in
effect
saying,
should
we
be
doing
that.
your
position
is
stronger
if
we
view
it
as
a
case
in
which
the
mootness
resulted
from
the
unilateral
act
of
a
party.
you
would
agree
there,
i
take
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
no
estoppel,
even
in
the
ninth
circuit,
because
that
requires
a
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
this
case,
what
possible
grounds,
under
your
rule,
would
a
court
have
for
refusing
to
vacate?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the
dictum,
the
considered
dictum
of
munsingwear
also
classified
it
as
a
happenstance
case,
not
a
settlement
case,
regardless
of
what
we
may
have
cited.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the
happenstance
referred,
i
thought,
to
the
event
which
resulted
in
the
mootness,
wasn't
that
correct?
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
you
did
have
a
litigation
of
fact
involved
here,
what
would
be
the
res
judicata
effect
if
we
go
your
way...
collateral
estoppel
effect
if
we
go
your
way?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
not
arguing
that
that
is
mitigated
by
the
fact
that
a
court
later
on
could
in
fact
consider
the
settlement
as
a
reason
not
to
give
estoppel
effect?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
there
would
be
no
way
to
get
out
of
it
on
your
view,
and
there
should
be
no
way
to
get
out
of
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
didn't
have
to
settle.
