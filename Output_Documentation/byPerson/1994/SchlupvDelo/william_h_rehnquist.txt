chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-7901,
lloyd
schlup
v.
paul
delo.
mr.
o'brien.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
evidence
was
introduced
at
trial
against
mr.
schlup?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
was
the
other...
on
the
basis
of
their
observations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
said
that
they
had
seen
him
stab
the
person?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
sounds
very
much
like
the
kind
of
questions
juries
resolve
every
day.
you
introduce
this
evidence
at
a
trial,
the
defense
introduces
evidence
showing
perhaps
a
mistake,
and
you
submit
it
to
a
jury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you
fail
this
time,
as
justice
scalia
says,
if
you
come
up
with
some
more
new
statements
or
newly
discovered
witnesses,
you
say
you
could
make
the
claim
again?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
or
do
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
we're
trying
to
find
out
here
is
which
of
two
or
perhaps
three
standards
apply
to
this
door-opener,
as
you
refer
to
it
and
as
justice
ginsburg,
the
kuhlmann
standard,
perhaps
murray
v.
carrier,
or
perhaps
sawyer,
all
of
which
have
stated
the
thing
in
somewhat
different
words.
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
eighth
circuit
held
here
that
the
sawyer
standard
applied
where
the
challenge
was
to
guilt
as
well
as
where
the
challenge
is
to
sentence,
and
that's
the
question
you
brought
before
us
for
review.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
should
have
two
different
standards,
one
for
guilt
and
one
for
sentence,
or
whether
sawyer
should
be
applied
across
the
board.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
going
to
be
some
awkwardness
if
we
have
two
different
standards,
one
for
guilt
and
one
for
sentence?
in
sawyer,
i
think
arson
was
both
an
aggravating
circumstance
and
an
element
of
the
crime,
so
would
you
say
that,
so
far
as
there
was
an
aggravating
circumstance,
you
would
analyze
it
under
the
sawyer
standard
but,
in
so
far
as
an
element
of
the
crime,
you
would
analyze
the
same
facts
under
the
kuhlmann
standard?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
no
matter
how
you
come
out,
it
seems
to
me,
there
is
going
to
be
an
unavoidable
complication
if
you
have
two
standards,
one
for
guilt
and
one
for
sentence,
in
a
case
like
sawyer,
where
the
proof
of
arson
was
both
an
aggravating
circumstance
and
an
element
of
a
crime.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
here
we're
talking
about
what
standard
are
we
going
to
require
to
prove
innocence.
we're
not
talking
about
whether
innocence
shall
be
provable,
but
what
standard,
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
your
insistence
on
two
different
standards
is
going
to
complicate
things.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
do
it
in
motions,
courts
do
it
in
motions
for
a
new
trial
all
the
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
that
you
were
relying
on
depositions
that
were
not
available
to
the
eighth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
had
them
at
the
time
it
prepared
its
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
the
sort
of
arguments
that
federal
courts
all
over
the
country
are
supposed
to
hear,
you
know,
recapitulating
the
sort
of
evidence
that
is
ordinarily
submitted
to
the
jury
on
guilt
or
innocence
in
every
one
of
these
claims
of
actual
innocence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
called
who
from
the
control
tower?
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
supposed
to
be
brought
out
at
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
o'brien.
general
nixon,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
did
this
crime
take
place,
general
nixon?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
more
than
10
years
ago.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
nixon.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
second
case
which
i
have
to
announce
today
is
number
93-7901
lloyd
schlup
v.
paul
k.
delo.
the
petitioner
lloyd
schlup
a
missouri
prisoner,
was
convicted
of
participating
in
the
murder
of
a
fellow
inmate
and
sentenced
to
death.
the
case
comes
to
us
on
review
of
schlup’s
second
federal
habeas
corpus
petition,
in
which
we
alleged
that
constitutional
error
deprived
the
jury
of
critical
evidence
that
would
have
established
his
innocence.
the
district
court
without
conducting
an
evidentiary
hearing
decline
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
showing
of
actual
innocence.
a
holding
of
the
petitioner
could
not
satisfy
the
threshold
showing
required
by
our
decision
in
a
case
called
sawyer
v.
whitley
that
was
decided
several
years
ago.
under
that
case
the
petitioner
has
to
show
“by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that,
but
for
a
constitutional
error,
no
reasonable
juror
would
have
found”
the
defendant
guilty
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eight
circuit
affirm
this.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
the
sawyer
standard
provides
adequate
protection
against
the
kind
of
miscarriage
of
justice
that
would
result
from
the
execution
of
a
prisoner
is
actually
innocent.
in
an
opinion
authored
by
justice
stevens
and
filed
with
the
clerk
the
court
concludes
that
the
standard
of
murray
v.
carrier
another
decision
of
ours
on
this
subject
which
requires
that
a
habeas
petitioner
show
that
“a
constitutional
violation
has
probably
resulted
in
the
conviction
of
one
who
is
actually
innocent”
rather
than
the
more
stringent
sawyer
standard,
governs
the
miscarriage
of
justice
inquiry,
when
claim
of
actual
innocence
on
the
merits
of
the
crime
is
raised.
accordingly,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
vacated
and
the
case
is
remanded
for
further
proceedings.
justice
o’connor
while
joining
the
court’s
opinion
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
i
have
also
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
kennedy
and
thomas
have
joined,
and
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
has
