justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was--
--very
question,
and
that
is,
are
you
recognizing
that
the
actual
innocence
claim
is
a
door-opener
so
that
you
must
have
behind
it
some
constitutional
claim,
the
brady
claim
ineffective,
or
are
you
making
the
argument
that
newly
discovered
evidence
of
innocence
of
the
crime
is
enough,
without
any
more,
to
make
that
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
fine.
i
just
wanted
to
know
what
your
position
is.
well,
on
that
point,
then,
for
a
successive
habeas
claim,
normally
we
require
the
petitioner
to
show
cause
and
prejudice,
do
we
not,
to
make
a
successive
habeas
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
nixon,
what
is
the
status
of
the
missouri
clemency
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that's
ongoing
right
now?
it's
the
same
status
it
was
in
when
we
granted
cert?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
hasn't
been
stayed
in
any
way
because
of
this
grant
of
cert?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
my
other
question
is,
is
it
your
position
that
the
discussion
of
how
strong
this
new
evidence
is
is
essentially
academic
because
there's
nothing
behind
the
gate,
and
i'd
like
you
to
address
that.
assuming
that
you
lose
on
the
standard,
is
it
your
position
that
there's
nothing
there,
so
that
if
there's
nothing
there,
there's
no
reason
to
find
out...
if
there's
nothing
behind
the
door,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
door
is
open
or
closed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
your
view
on
why
that
is
not
the
one
we
should
adopt
is...
why
carrier
is
not
the
standard
we
should
adopt?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
across
the
line,
or
were
you
conceding
that
the
friendly
position
is
okay
for
the
first
habeas,
but
after
that
it's
not?
