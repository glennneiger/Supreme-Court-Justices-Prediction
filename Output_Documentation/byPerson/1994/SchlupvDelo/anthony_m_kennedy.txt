justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
wasn't
there
some
evidence
that,
i
think
it
was,
eberle
called
the
guards
out
of
the
cafeteria,
or
at
least
told
peoples
to
do
that,
some
10
to
15
minutes
after
the
disturbance?
at
least,
can't
you
make
that
inference
from
the
evidence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
fact
that
someone
else
could
have
made
the
call
doesn't
mean
that
eberle
didn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is...
do
you
want
to
show
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel?
is
that
the
constitutional
issue
you
want
to
argue
if
you
meet
the
threshold
of
the
exception
that
you're
arguing
about?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
far
as
ineffective
assistance,
that
would
almost
put
us
in
the
position
of
advisory,
wouldn't
it,
because
the
circuit
has
already
said,
we
have
looked
at
this
issue
and
we
are
not
going
to
change
our
mind;
we
have
found
that
there
was
effective
assistance
of
counsel.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
if
we
disagree
with
you
that
it's
dictum
in
the
circuit
court's
opinion,
the
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim
has
been
litigated
and
resolved,
is
that
not
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
incidentally,
and
was
your
brady
claim
presented
to
the
circuit
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
question
is,
was
the
brady
claim
presented
to
the
circuit
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
it
was
peoples
that
sent
out
the
alarm
that
resulted
in
the
police
leaving
the
cafeteria?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
state's
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is
your
theory
as
to
who
could
call
the
police
from
the
cafeteria?
did
green
have
that
authority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
direct
the
police
to
leave?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
that's
the
point.
the
point
is,
what
is
the
first
call
to
the
police
in
the
cafeteria?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
ambivalence
in
the
theory
of
your
case,
it
seems
to
me,
or
the
tension,
is
that
you
tell
us
that
this
is
a
most
unusual
case
with
compelling
evidence
of
innocence,
and
yet
you
want
us
to
adopt
the
lowest
possible,
or
one
of
the
lowest
possible
standards,
colorable
showing
of
innocence,
and
it
seems
to
me
if
we
adopt
colorable
showing
of
innocence
then,
as
the
chief
justice
indicates,
this
kind
of
inquiry,
the
most
intrusive
of
all
inquiries,
relitigating
the
facts,
is
going
to
have
to
be
done
in
every
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
didn't
prevail
under
clear
and
convincing
in
the
circuit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
didn't
prevail
in
the
circuit
under
the
clear-and-convincing
standard,
did
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
theory
of
the
case
that
time
may
have
elapsed
between
the
first
notice
to
the
base
of
a
disturbance
and
the
time
that
peoples
called
for
help?
what
is
your
theory
as
to
what
prompted
the
guards
to
leave
the
cafeteria?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
caused
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
from
whom?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
your
theory
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
had
he
in
turn
received
calls
from,
say,
perhaps
green?
is
that
possible,
or
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
green
on
a
frequency
that
was
different
from
the
one
that
peoples
used
to
communicate
to
the
guards
in
the
cafeteria?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
the
base.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
there
may
have
been
a
substantial
delay
between
the
time
that
call
was
made
and
the
time
the
alert
went
out
from
base
to
the
guards
in
the
cafeteria?
that's
your
theory?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
pardon
me,
is
it
your
theory
that
the
first
time
the
base
received
any
notice
of
an
incident,
that
they
called
the
guards
in
the
cafeteria?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
your
position
is
that
that
has
been
reserved
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
position
is
the
petitioner
has
reserved
the
brady
claim
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
the
event
he
wins
on
the
standard
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it's
been
preserved
adequately
in
the
court
of
appeals,
in
your
view?
