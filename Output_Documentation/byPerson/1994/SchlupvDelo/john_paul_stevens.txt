justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
o'brien,
can
i
ask
you
a
factual
question
that
i
don't
quite
understand--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
record?
on
page
33
of
the
joint
appendix,
there's
a
quote
that's
referred
to
in
the
briefs
and
so
forth,
where
john
green
states
that
he
stepped
out
of
the
office
and
he
heard
flowers
calling
for
officers,
"couldn't
get
nobody
so
he
told
me
to
call
base
to
notify
them
of
the
fight
and
that's
what
i
did.
"
you're
familiar
with
that
quote,
i
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
quote
from
his
present
affidavit,
or
is
that
from
the
interview
with,
the
pretrial
interview
by
the
correction
officials?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
was
that
quote...
he
did
not
testify
at
the
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
quote
was
not
made
a
part
of
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
was
that
quote
made
available
to
his
counsel?
that's...
i
can't
quite
figure
it
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
one
except
the
corrections
officers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
one
other
factual
question.
is
there
any
dispute
about
the
fact
that
there
was
indeed
a
telephone
accessible
as
he
describes
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
one
other
question,
then
i'll
be
through.
was
green
in
some
different
status
from
most
inmates?
did
he
have
some
kind
of
responsibilities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
opponent
contends
in
effect
that
he's
lying
in
this
particular
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
that.
they
disagree
with
that
fact.
they
say
he
did
not,
because
if
he
called
them,
obviously
this
fellow
couldn't
have
been
at
the
head
of
the
line.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
agree,
wouldn't
you,
that
if
green
is
telling
the
truth,
and
if
the
officer...
the
new
officer
is
telling
the
truth,
then
he
is
innocent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
officer
who
stopped
him
and
frisked
schlup
on
the
way
to
the
dining
hall,
if
he's
telling
the
truth
the
guy
has
to
be
innocent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
saying
as
to
when
he
made
the
phone
call,
not
when
the
alarm
went
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
it
has
to
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you're
saying
it
has
to
be
more
than
26
seconds.
it
could
not
be
contemporaneous.
if
it
was
within
a
minute,
say,
rather
than
either
contemporaneous
or
5
minutes
later,
then
the
man
has
to
be
innocent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
officer
flaherty's
testimony?
justice
john
paul
stevens
faherty,
whatever
his
name
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
supposing
what
he's
saying
now
is
true.
wouldn't
the
man
have
to
be
innocent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
he
explain
why
he
didn't
put
in
this
statement
by
green
if
he
had
access
to
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
we
know
that
he
read
that
statement,
one
way
or
another?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say
there
are
hundreds
of
depositions,
a
large
volume
of
material.
i
don't
know,
maybe
not
hundreds,
but
they
interviewed
a
large
number
of
inmates,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
wrote
down
what
they
said
in
those
interviews?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
he
saw
all
that
material,
but
you
don't
know
whether
he
particularly
focused
on
this
statement
by
green,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
didn't
comment
one
way
or
another?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
he
had
everything
available.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
your
advice
on
one,
or
your
help
on
one
other
word
that
i
don't
understand
in
the
record.
when
schlup
was
interviewed
before
he
knew
there
was
a
videotape
and
so
forth,
he
said
he
was
the
first
one
in
the
dining
room,
and
officer
basinger
said...
hemeyer
said,
whoa,
be
careful.
then
the
other
officer
said,
don't
be
parachuting
on
us.
do
you
remember
that
in
the
record?
what
does
the
word
parachuting
mean?
that's
a
new
one
on
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
just,
apparently...
what
i
infer
from
it,
i
hope
you'll
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
is
that
basinger
thought
that
was
so
improbable
that
he
could
have
been
at
the
head
of
the
line,
that
he
said,
don't
be
parachuting
on
us.
that's
the
inference
i
draw.
do
you
think
i'm
wrong?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
cite
me
to
a
case
in
which
a
lawyer
ever
said...
i
can't
imagine
a
defense
lawyer
in
a
capital
case
withholding
evidence
of
innocence
because
he
might
want
to
use
it
later.
does
that
really
happen?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
that
what
you
mean
by
sand-bagging?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
it
was
a
tactical...
sand-bagging
referred
to
a
tactical
decision
by
a
lawyer
not
to
use
evidence
of
innocence
because
he
wants
to
use
it
later,
and
i
just
don't
think
it
happens.
maybe
i'm
wrong,
but
ethical
counsel
doing
that,
i
just
can't
believe
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
cite
me
a
case
in
which
any
appellate
court
describes
that
having
happened?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
certainly
am
not
aware
of
any.
--that
you're
about
to
make,
so
just
the...
my
understanding
of
this,
and
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
i
may
well
be
wrong,
but
my
understanding
of
this
is
that
we're
talking
about
a
person
in
general
who
has
some
kind
of
a
claim
that
his
trial
was
unconstitutional
or
held
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
he's
already
had
one
habeas
proceeding.
now
he
comes
to
a
second,
a
third,
or
a
fourth,
and
normally
it
involves
a
claim
that
wasn't
made
at
the
first.
it
could
involve
a
claim
that
was,
in
which
case
it
would
be
a
successor,
but
it
involves
a
claim
that
wasn't
made
at
the
first
proceeding,
and
so
the
obvious
question
is,
why
didn't
you
make
it
before?
and
he
has
to
have
a
very
good
answer
to
that,
really
a
very
good
answer,
or
we
won't
even
listen
to
it.
but
there's
an
exception.
the
exception
to
his
having
a
very
good
answer,
maybe
it's
only
a
fairly
good
answer,
but
not
a--
the
exception
is
if
you
really
think
there
was
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
now,
what's
that?
and
my
reading
of
it
is
what
henry
friendly
said
is...
well,
what
that
is,
is
if
the
trier
of
fact...
i'm
the
habeas
judge,
imagine...
if
the
trier
of
fact
would
have
entertained
a
reasonable
doubt
of
guilt.
that's
what
henry
friendly
once
said
the
judge
should
ask
himself,
and
i
take
it
kuhlmann
basically
picked
that
up,
not
using
exactly
those
words.
and
then,
if
you're
going
to
use
that
standard,
i'll
tell
you
one
variety
of
miscarriage
of
justice,
if
you,
judge,
sitting
there,
think
that
the
trier
of
fact
at
the
trial
had
seen
all
this
evidence
he
would
have
found
a
reasonable
doubt.
now,
that's
basically
the
kuhlmann
standard,
and
they
say
they've
met
it
in
this
very
unusual
case.
henry
friendly
said,
believe
me,
those
cases
are
few
and
far
between.
having
sat
in
a
court
of
appeals,
i
would
agree,
and
i
hope
they're
very
far
between,
but
they
say
they've
got
one.
all
right,
my
question
is,
we're
talking
about
an
exception
that
comes
up
rarely,
why
do
you
need
a
tougher
standard
than
that,
that
the
judge
should
sit
there,
ask
himself
conscientiously,
with
all
this
stuff
in
here,
all
the
evidence,
would
that
trier
of
fact
have
had
a
reasonable
doubt,
would
have,
not
some
theoretical
speculation?
if
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
i
should
at
least
listen
to
the
constitutional
claim,
and
my
statement
of
it
may
be
wrong,
in
which
case,
correct
me,
but
if
not,
then
what
is
the
answer
to
that?
