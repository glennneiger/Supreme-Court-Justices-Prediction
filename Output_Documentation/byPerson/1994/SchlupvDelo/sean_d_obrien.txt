mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issues
in
this
case
involve
the
standard
for
determining
a
colorable
claim
that
the
wrong
person
has
been
convicted
of
a
crime.
mr.
schlup's
case
is
an
extraordinary
case
in
which
the
system
of
justice
broke
down
and
produced
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice.
the
facts
of
this
case
reveal
the
need
for
the
miscarriage
of
justice
safety
valve.
it
is
our
position
that
a
standard
that
does
not
reach
mr.
schlup's
case
is
incapable
of
protecting
the
innocent.
there
are
certain
facts,
objective
facts,
in
this
case
that
both
sides
must
accept,
have
accepted
since
the
beginning.
the
victim
in
this
case,
arthur
dade,
was
stabbed
in
the
missouri
state
penitentiary
in
a
housing
unit
shortly
after
all
of
the
prisoners
were
released
to
lunch.
a
surveillance
video
shows
that
mr.
schlup
was
the
first
inmate
to
enter
the
dining
room,
which
is
150
yards,
three
floors,
and
at
least
one
security
checkpoint
away
from
the
scene
of
the
crime,
and
a
minute
and
5
seconds
after
mr.
schlup
enters
the
dining
room,
the
guards
are
seen
responding
to
a
radio
distress
call.
now,
at
trial,
in
order
to
prove
mr.
schlup's
guilt,
the
state
had
to
do
two
things.
first,
it
had
to
show
a
substantial
delay
between
the
homicide
and
the
radio
distress
call,
and
the
second
thing
it
had
to
show
was
that
mr.
schlup
raced
past
everyone
else
to
cut
in
line,
the
head
of
the
line
for
lunch,
and
there
is
now
strong,
uncontradicted
evidence
that
now
rebuts
both
of
those
propositions,
and
this
evidence
is
also
corroborated
by
other
direct,
circumstantial,
and
scientific
evidence
that
mr.
schlup
was
not
involved
in
the
crime.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
the
evidence
at
trial
was
two
identification
witnesses,
a
officer
who
was
the
one
opening
the
cell
block
for
lunch,
and
another
one
on
the
uppermost
tier
in
the
housing
unit.
that
was
the
only
direct
evidence,
and
they
both
said
that
mr.
schlup
committed
the
crime.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
yes.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
correct.
they
said
that
they
saw
mr.
schlup
hold
the
victim
while
another
inmate,
robert
o'neal,
stabbed
him
in
the
chest,
and
we
have
eye
witnesses
to
the
crime
who
say
that
that
person
was
randy
jordan
who
held
the
victim,
while
robert
o'neal
stabbed
him
in
the
chest.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
you
can
make
that
inference
from
the
evidence,
but
it
would
be
a
false
assumption.
the
false
assumption
is
that
eberle
was
the
only
person
who
could
have
made
that
call
because
the
radio
was
the
only
way
out
of
the
housing
unit,
and
in
fact
there
was
a
telephone
that
has
a
speed
dial
number
keyed
in
right
to
the
control
center
within
15
feet
of
where
the
victim
collapsed.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
that's
true,
but
the
question
here,
your
honor,
is
who
made
the
first
call?
was
eberle's
call
transmitted
before
mr.
schlup,
you
know,
or
after
mr.
schlup
got
into
the
dining
room,
and
actually
in
this
case
they
built
a
delay
into
eberle
even
getting
into
the
housing
unit
to
make
that
call,
but
my
point,
your
honor,
is
there
was
ample
evidence
to
show
several
sources
of
the
guards
being
notified
that--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--your
honor,
in
this
case
there
was
key
evidence
withheld
from
the
jury
that
completely
stripped
the
videotape
of
its
probative
value,
and
that
was
the
evidence
of
a
witness
who
said
that
he
picked
up
the
telephone
and
called
base
within
30
seconds
of
arthur
dade
hitting
the
ground,
and
if
that's
so,
then
mr.
schlup
was
in
the
dining
room
at
the
time.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
it
was
not
presented
to
the
jury.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
pardon
me?
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
the
defense
lawyer
could
have,
had
he
done
a
reasonable
investigation,
found
this
evidence,
and
i
think
there's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
that
fact
was
disclosed
to
the
defense
attorney.
that's
a
question
of
fact
that
exists
in
this
case
that
has
not
been
resolved.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
that
is
one
of
the
constitutional
claims
that
underlies
the
showing
of
innocence.
this
is
a...
excuse
me.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
it
was
made
in
a
prior
habeas
with
absolutely--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--yes,
this
time--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--your
honor,
our
position
is
that
we
can
now
prove
that
mr.
schlup
is
innocent
under--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--your
honor--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--i
would
make...
i
would
continue
to
make
the
claim
because
that's
my
role
as
an
advocate
for
the
client,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
your
honor,
at
this
point
i
think
we
have
as
much
probative
evidence
of
mr.
schlup's
innocence
as
we
need
to
meet
the
standard
that
this
court--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--that
is
one,
your
honor.
the
other
is
brady
v.
maryland.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
your
honor,
i
believe
that...
to
me,
that
statement
in
the
court
below
seems
to
be
dicta,
because
the
court
said
in
another
case
in
its
opinion
that
we
might
get
a
different
result
under
a
different
standard.
the
underlying
facts
have
never
been
resolved
in
the
district
court
because
there
was
never
any
evidence
introduced
in
the
first
habeas
corpus,
and
in
the
eighth
circuit--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
correct.
but
it
was--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--your
honor,
in
this
case,
mr.
schlup's
innocence
functions
as
a
door
opener
to
get
into
court.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
normally,
the
court
does
require
that,
your
honor.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
that's
correct.
we're
not
asking
the
court
to
do
away
with
cause
under
the
cause
prejudice
test
and,
in
fact,
every
time
this
court
refers
to
the
cause
prejudice
standard,
it
also
reserves
the
possibility
of
the
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
as
a
recognition
that
there
will
be
occasional
cases
that
the
cause
prejudice
test
does
not
reach,
but--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
the
standard
that
we
are
asking
to
apply,
the
standard
that
this
court
applies,
is
kuhlmann
v.
wilson.
we
are--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--your
honor,
i
believe
it's
clear
from
the
court's
jurisprudence
that
the
kuhlmann
standard
is
greater
than
the
cause-and-prejudice
standard,
and
i
think
mccleskey
is
a
good
example
of
that.
the
kuhlmann
standard
is
really
a
truth-oriented
standard.
we
are
trying
to
determine
the
equity
of
innocence
and
whether
or
not
it
exists
in
the
case.
the
cause-and-prejudice
standard
is
oriented
to
the
adversarial
system
and
whether
it's
produced
an
appropriate
result,
but
mccleskey
is
a
good
example
of
a
person
who
could
probably
show
prejudice
had
he
been
able
to
show
cause,
but
he
could
definitely
not
meet
the
kuhlmann
standard.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
that's
correct,
your
honor,
except
that
when
the
sawyer
standard
stated...
when
the
sawyer
decision
stated
the
miscarriage-of-justice
standard
for
death-penalty
people,
guilty
people
who
were
challenging
a
sentence,
it
specifically
stated
that
that
situation
is
distinctly
different
than
an
innocent
person
coming
before
the
court
asking
for
access
to
a
court's
enforcement
of
the
constitution.
in
that
case,
the
kuhlmann
standard
was
praised
as
a
standard
that
is
easy
to
apply,
and
indeed--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--correct.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
believe
there
are
two
different
standards
because
there
are
two
different
situations.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
your
honor--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--it
did
apply
it
to
a
guilt
phase
standard,
but
not
an
innocence
argument.
i
believe
there's
a
fundamental
distinction,
because
sawyer's
innocence,
even
if
he
was...
even
if
it
was
true,
as
the
court
observed,
still
left
him
guilty
of
a
capital
crime,
and
so
he
was
not
innocent
in
the
sawyer
sense
of
the
word.
he
was
not
innocent
of
the
death
penalty,
he
was
not
innocent
of
the
crime.
i
believe
there's
also
a
world
of
difference
between
innocence
where
you've
got
the
wrong
person,
and
innocence
where
you
have
the
right
person
but
the
wrong
crime,
and
this
is
innocence
where
we
have
the
wrong
person
convicted
of
this
crime,
and
we
have
introduced
ample
evidence--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
there
is
ample
evidence
that
a
reasonable
attorney
could
have
found...
there
were
four
or
five
people
who
were
interviewed
by
corrections
officers
who
said
that
they
saw
the
murder,
and
this
is
not
based
on
what
counsel--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--if
you
disagree
with
me,
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
probably
correct.
i
believe
that--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--your
honor,
the
brady
claim
was
presented
in
the
district
court.
the
briefing
in
the
circuit
court
focused
mainly
on
the
procedural
gateway
argument,
and--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--no,
your
honor,
and
i
don't
recall
if
the
ineffective
counsel
claim
was
presented.
the
majority
opinion
was
responding
more
to
the
dissenting
opinion,
and
that
was
kind
of
a
process
of
the
expedited
nature
of
the
proceedings.
this
case
was
decided
in
the
eighth
circuit
under
execution
warrant
with
simultaneous
briefs
filed,
and
then
the
major
bases
for
the
eighth
circuit's
ruling
on
the
merits,
or
discussion
of
the
merits,
were
depositions
that
were
filed
at
oral
argument
just
a
few
days
before
the
execution
warrant
was
scheduled
to
be
carried
out.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
that's
correct.
this
is...
the
issues
in
this
case
involve
the
gateway.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
exactly.
exactly,
and
we
were--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--i
believe
those
are
equivalent
standards.
i
think
that
is
the
same
standard,
your
honor,
and
in--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--herrera
is...
yes.
i'm
not
sure.
i
mean,
i
hope,
as
justice
o'connor
said
in
herrera,
hopefully
the
court
will
never
have
to
address
the
herrera
claim,
because
i
think
if
the
case
gets
this
far
and
there
is
still
compelling
evidence
of
innocence,
such
as
in
this
case,
then
it's
likely
that
something,
that
these
constitutional
rights
that
exist
to
ensure
the
reliability
of
the
result
probably
were
violated
somewhere
down
the
line.
there's--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--i
would
settle
for
the
carrier
formulation,
your
honor.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
a
phrase
in
your
opinion
in
sawyer
that
indicates
that
may
be
so,
but
i
disagree.
i
believe
the
fundamental
distinction
between
an
innocent
person
and
a
person
who
is
convicted
of
the
wrong
crime,
or
a
lesser
crime,
and
the
first
question
in
that
second
situation
you
hypothesized
is
whether
or
not
that
is
a
fundamental
miscarriage
of
justice
at
all.
the
circuits
below
are
split
on
that
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
sentencing
claim
in
a
noncapital
case
or
a
lesser
included
offense
innocence
claim
is
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
as
i
said,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
for
mr.
schlup's
situation
i
think
that
it
would
not
be
too
confusing,
or
too
difficult,
and
there's
always
a
cost
involved
in
the
exercise
of
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction.
the
question
is
whether
the
cost
is
worth
it,
and
this
court
has
said
consistently
that
in
the
context
of
an
innocent
person,
and
whenever
it
has
said
that,
it's
been
talking
about
someone
convicted
of
the
wrong
crime,
then
innocence
becomes
the
ultimate
equity.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
your
honor,
i
believe
innocence
of
the
crime
and
innocence
of
the
sentence
are
two
situations
that
require
two
standards,
and
this
court
does
not
apply
one
uniform
standard
across
the
board
whenever
it
devises
a
standard
for
harmless
error,
or
prejudice,
or
in
some
other
context.
it
looks
at
the
interests
involved
and
the
equities
involved
in
exercising
habeas
corpus
jurisprudence...
or
jurisdiction,
rather,
and
so
it
is
not
inappropriate
to
have
two
standards
for
this,
because
many--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--your
honor--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--your
honor,
i
disagree
that
having
a
miscarriage-of-justice
standard
will
always
frustrate
finality.
in
this
case...
and
this
court
applies
many
standards,
and
i
believe
that's
where
in
kuhlmann
the
term
"colorable
claim"
comes
in.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
your
honor,
claims
of
innocence
this
strong
are
very
rare,
and
i
believe
the
circumstances
that
you
describe
would
be
very
rare.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
there's
a
pleading
standard,
that
i
believe
that
the
courts
are
capable
of
looking
at
pleadings
and
attachments
and
affidavits,
as
we
did
below,
attached
to
the
pleadings,
that
would
allow
the
court
to
determine,
on
the
basis
of
the
pleading
standard,
whether
or
not
this
was
a
colorable
claim
that
should
be
allowed
to
go
forward.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
yes,
they
do
and,
your
honor,
in
this
case,
i
believe
in
your
observation
in
sawyer
you
stated
that
in
order
to
satisfy
the
kuhlmann
test
a
prisoner,
in
addition
to
the
habeas,
would
have
to
tender
to
the
court
reliable,
noncumulative,
and
admissible
evidence,
which
we
did
with
our
petition
for
habeas
corpus.
and
also,
as
this
court
observed
in
blackledge
v.
allison,
that
the
court
need
not
move
forward
with
the
hearing
unless
there
are
factual
assertions
and
not
just
allegations,
there's
specific
evidence,
the
evidence
is--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--yes,
your
honor--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
that
quote
is
from
a
pretrial
interview
by
the
corrections
officials
about
3
days
after
the
crime.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
correct.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
exactly.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
the
record
is
open
to
that,
and
the
counsel...
outside
the
record,
the
counsel
cannot
recall
that
quote
being
made
available.
it
surfaced
in
the
habeas
litigation
below,
and
the
prosecution,
or
mr.
nixon's
office,
submitted
a
response
to
our
petition
and
attached
exhibit
t.
this
is
response
exhibit
t,
where
the
statement
comes
from.
the
existence
of
green
was
known
prior
to
the
second
petition,
but
no
one
had
interviewed
him
or
introduced
this
statement.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
except
the
corrections
officer,
that's
correct.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
none
whatsoever,
and
in
fact
control
center
officers
say
that
it
is
not
unusual
at
all
that
inmates
would
use
that
phone
and
make
calls,
and
there's
a
speed
dial
process
that
is
wired
into
one
of
two
different
control
centers.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
yes,
your
honor.
he
was
a
clerk,
which
is
like
a
trustee
position,
and
so
he
had
the
run
of
the
housing
unit
and
worked
in
the
office,
did
not
have
to
spend
all
of
his
time
locked
down
in
his
cell.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
necessary
that,
in
order
for
mr.
schlup
to
be
guilty,
that
you
say
that
mr.
green
is
lying.
mr.
green
made
this
statement
before
anybody
knew
of
the
existence
of
a
videotape,
or
knew
of
the...
knew
the
impact
of
that
call
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
in
the
brief
we
point
out
that
mr.
green
has
in
fact
passed
a
polygraph
test
when
asked
whether
or
not
he
saw
the
crime
and
whether
he
saw
whether
schlup
was
involved,
and
whether
or
not
he
made
the
call,
as
he
was
ordered
to
do
so.
it's
also
consistent--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--mr.
green
is
the
unit
clerk
in
the
housing
unit
who
is
the
one
who
picked
up
the
telephone
and
called
the
base
when
roger
flowers
ordered
him
to
do
so,
and
mr.
flowers
in
a
couple
of
points
in
this--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--that's
correct,
and
i
believe...
they
have
not
introduced
any
evidence
to
show
that
mr.
green
did
not
make
that
call.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
we
have
in
the
court
below
filed
a
rule
60(b)
motion
with
evidence
that
we
discovered
during
executive
clemency
proceedings,
and
there
is
a
corrections
officer
named
kerrs
who
received
a
call.
she
does
not
recall
the
identity
of
the
person
who
made
the
call,
but
she
could
hear
the
sounds
of
the
confusion
and
the
shouting
going
on
in
the
background,
and
she
believes
that
call
came
in
contemporaneously
with
the
homicide,
but
she
does
not
recall
the
identity
of
the
caller.
but
that,
plus
roger
flowers'
testimony
that
before
he
went
in
to
break
up
the
fight,
he
turned
to
someone
and
said,
call
base,
or
get
help,
or
words
to
that
effect,
and
mr.
green
was
the
person
whose
obligation
it
was,
whose
job
it
was
to
respond
to
that
call.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
that
is
the
state's
position,
and
there
is
an
affi...
i
believe,
is
a
deposition
to
that
effect,
but
their--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--anyone
with
a
telephone
or
a
radio
could
make
that
call.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
yes.
i
mean,
actually
it
would
have
to
be
someone
from
the
control
center,
but
there
are
two
control
centers.
there's
a
housing
unit
control
center,
and
there's
the
main
penitentiary
control
center,
and
officer
peoples
was
operating
the
housing
unit
control
center,
and
officer
kerr
was
operating
the
main
penitentiary
control
center.
she
received
a
call,
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
peoples
also
received
a
call,
or
i
assume
that
he
did.
i
don't
know
why
he
would
not
be
telling
the
truth.
but
the
point
is,
was
that
the
first
call
to
be
broadcast,
and
there's
another
fact
that--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--correct,
and
was
it
kerr
or
was
it
people?
but
the
other
fact
that
came
up
in
the
depositions
that
were
filed
after
the
opinion
below
is,
when
officer
flowers
in
his
deposition
was
asked
when
it
was
that
he
met
captain
eberle,
who
is
the
source
of
the
radio
call
the
prosecution
relies
upon,
he
said
it
was
after
arthur
dade
had
been
carried
out
of
the
housing
unit
on
a
stretcher--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--no,
your
honor.
these
depositions
were
filed
in
the
eighth
circuit
after
the
oral
argument,
and
they're
the
depositions
that
the
eighth
circuit
relied
upon
in
its
discussion.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
yes,
it
did.
yes,
it
did,
but
the
salient
point
that
i
believe
was
overlooked
was
captain
eberle,
according
to
sergeant
flowers,
arrived
in
the
housing
unit
after
arthur
dade
had
been
carried
out
on
a
stretcher,
and
the
videotape
shows
that
event
took
place
30
seconds
after
the
guards
ran
out
in
response
to
the
radio
call.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
your
honor--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--it
should
have
been,
and
the
trial
should
be
the
main
event,
and
in
this
case
there
were
constitutional
violations
that
we're
trying
to
prove
that
prevented
the
trial
from
being
the
main
event.
and
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
in
strickland
v.
washington,
where
you
have
that
situation
where
the
trial
is
not
the
main
event
because
of
a
constitutional
violation,
then
there
is
far
less
reason
to
defer
to
the
findings
of
the
jury.
because
we're
not
just
talking
about...
the
videotape-eye
view
was
collaboration
of
ample
other
evidence,
including
the
fact
that
one
of
the
eye
witnesses,
it
was
unknown
at
trial,
is
a
three-time
convicted
felon.
it
was
assumed,
i
think
wrongly,
by
everyone
in
the
case
that
just
because
a
person
is
a
corrections
officer,
that
they're
a
police
officer
and
they
have
no
felony
record,
but
in
this
case
that
was
not
a
correct
assumption.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
your
honor,
the
probability
of
innocence,
i
believe,
is
what
the
law
is
and
what
it
should
be,
because
a
standard
higher
than
that
will
not
reach
other
innocent
people,
but
mr.
schlup's
position
is
that
we
could
prevail
under
any
standard
that
is
less
demanding
than
jackson
v.
virginia.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
your
honor,
the
circuit...
the
circuit
court
looked
only
at
mr.
schlup's
evidence
and
really
did
not
consider...
there's...
the
discussion
regarding
the
state's
evidence
in
this
case
is
simply
that
it's--
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
--not
as
applied
in
the
circuit,
your
honor.
mr.
sean
d.
o'brien
correct.
