mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
lloyd
schlup
is
not
innocent
of
this
murder
by
any
standard,
but
the
standard
that
this
court
should
apply
is
the
sawyer
standard.
the
clear-and-convincing
standard
is
appropriate,
especially
in
cases
such
as
this,
where
you
have
repackaged
and
redeveloped
evidence
that
comes
at
the
eleventh
hour,
continues
to
flow
in
as
the
process
moves
through
the
appellate
courts,
8,
9,
10
years
later,
new
evidence,
people
changing
their
testimony,
repackaged
evidence.
this
is
the
type
of
case
that
screams
out--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--this
crime
took
place
in
february
of
1984.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
yes.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
no,
your
honor,
i
would
not.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
if
green
is...
if
green--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--no,
your
honor,
i
would
not.
if
green...
your
honor,
if
we
believe
green's
new
story,
which
is
in
direct
contravention
to
what
he
testified
in
trial
at
stewart's
trial,
as
well
as
his
earlier
statements,
if
you
believe
that
he
radioed
in
immediately
upon
the
time
of
the
body
falling--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--then
you
look
at
the
videotape,
and
there
is
only
26
seconds
between
the
time
that
that
call
was
supposedly
made
by
green
and
the
time
that
o'neal
comes
into
the
cafeteria
downstairs,
and
all
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
shows
it's
impossible
for
o'neal,
the
admitted
murderer,
who
claims
self-defense,
to
have
stabbed,
to
have
run
down,
as
the
uncontroverted
evidence
says,
broken
a
window,
thrown
the
knife
out
the
window,
come
back,
washed
his
hands,
with
other
witnesses,
including
other
corrections
officers
seeing
him
wash
the
hands,
and
go
down
to
the
cafeteria,
if
you
hold
green's
present
statement
as
controlling,
the
murder
never
occurred.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
they
are
claiming,
your
honor,
that
it
is
contemporaneous,
that
somehow
this
phone
call--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--is
equivalent
to
a...
excuse
me,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
your
honor,
in
no
situation
does
this
man
have
to
be
innocent,
because
the
facts
in
this
case
are
overwhelming.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
officer
faherty--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--excuse
me.
officer
faherty's
changed
and
redeveloped
testimony--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--no.
because
officer
faherty's
time...
first
of
all,
officer
faherty
is
not
a
witness
to
the
murder.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
maylee
and
flowers
were.
faherty
is
merely
testifying
as
to
the
amount
of
time
spent
near
what's
called
the
t-3
gate.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
he
has
broadened
that
time
from
10
to
15
seconds,
which
he
testified
at
trial,
to
now
4
to
5
minutes
total
for
a
period
of
time
down
there.
regardless
of
what
his
testimony
is,
that
doesn't
tie
to
anything
else.
it
sits
there
by
itself,
and
so
in
and
of
itself
does
not
provide
clear-and-convincing
evidence.
obviously,
it's
probative
and
interesting,
but
no,
it
does
not
provide
clear-and-convincing
evidence
in
any
shape
or
form
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
yes--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--justice
souter.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
a
possible
analysis
of
it.
however,
it
is
important
to
note
that,
as
i
indicated
before,
if
you
believe
green's
present
third
version
testimony,
the
murder
by
o'neal
could
not
even
have
occurred,
and
green
has
testified
in
front
of
a
jury.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
yes.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
the
guards
were
prompted
to
leave
the
cafeteria
by
a
call.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
the
radio
call.
they
received
a
radio
call.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
we
would--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--peoples,
from
the
base.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
under
our
theory--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--certainly
it's
possible.
he
may
or
may
not
have
received
calls...
this...
this...
the
new
evidence
that's
just
been
raised
in
a
60(b)
motion
about
somebody
else
and
some
other
base
getting
a
call,
too,
may
have
happened.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
there's
no
evidence
as
to
what
frequency.
the
evidence
subsequent
would
show
that
the
method
of
communication
by
green
was
a
phone,
and
not
a
radio,
and
i
think
that
is
an
important
and
essential
point
to
what
is
going
on
here,
is
that
even
under
green's
new
testimony,
he
went
back
to
this
little
office
on
top
and
made
a
phone
call--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--to
base.
he's
not
sure
what
base.
earlier,
it
was
the
base
where
peoples
was.
now,
they
say
it's
the
base,
some
other
base
where
somebody
else
may
have
heard
that
call.
the
60(b)
motion
talks
about
a
different
person
receiving
that
call.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
no,
your
honor.
i
would
say
that
our
theory
is
that
the
delay
occurred
when...
in
the
time
prior
to
that,
that
what
happened
in
this
situation
as
the
two
eye
witnesses
see
it--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--that
was
the
deposition
testimony
of
peoples,
who
is
very
clear
in
saying
that
he
received
the
radio
call
from
eberle,
who
had
come
up
the
steps,
and
that
was
the
basis
of
his
call.
that
was
the
time
that
peoples
made
the
call
that
went
out,
the
1050,
that
caused
the
reaction
that
was
seen
down
in
the
cafeteria,
that
it
was
peoples'
call
some
minutes
after
dade
was
actually
stabbed,
and
not,
if
it
even
occurred,
the
green
call,
which
went
down
to...
i
should
note,
justice
kennedy,
another
matter
of
import
in
this
is
that
at
the
pcr
hearing
prior
to
this,
the
defense
counsel
was...
an
affidavit
of
the
defense
counsel
was
presented.
he
admitted
having
access
to
all
of
the
investigation
materials,
all
100
interviews
that
we're
talking
about
here,
the
original
statements
of
green,
the
statements
that
talk
about
this.
trial
counsel
had
all
of
those,
and
made
the
decisions
at
trial
not
to
bring
that
evidence
forward
in
the
fashion
that
he
thought
was
appropriate.
he
had...
and
i
think
it's
an
essential
part
of
this
when
you
talk
about
moving
through
a
gateway
to
an
ineffective
claim
here.
this
is
a
counsel
that
had
100
interviews
that
they
admit
that
they
reviewed.
they
took
38
depositions.
defense
counsel
is
the
one
who
discovered
the
so-called
videotape
that's
out
there,
and
effectively,
aggressively
defended
this
case.
they
brought
inmates
into
the
courtroom
to
testify
about
how
the
timing
of
mr.
schlup--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--no,
he
did
not.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
the
pcr
motion
and
the
statement
by
the
counsel
at
that
pcr
motion
would
indicate
that
he
had
in
his
possession
and
"reviewed"
all--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--one
hundred.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
one
hundred
individuals.
it
was
taped.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
they
were
all
taped.
those
transcripts
were
then
turned
over.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
no,
i
do
not
know
whether
he
did.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
no,
he
did
indicate,
and
the
trial
court
found--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--that
he
had
it
all.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
that
it
was
all
there,
and
it
should
be
noted
also
that
this
was
the
third
of
the
cases
to
be
tried
in
a
trilogy,
and
they
had
access
to
the
trial
transcripts
of
the
first
two
trials.
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
there
was
not
a
great
deal
of
discovery
done
prior
to
trial.
defense
counsel
had
all
of
this
evidence
and
information
in
his
hands.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
i'm
not
familiar
with
all
the
different
jargon
of
the
correctional
officers
in
prison,
your
honor.
i
just
don't
know
what
parachuting
us
means.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
your
honor,
i
don't
know
what
the
term
means,
and
you're
entitled
to
draw
the
inference
you
think
is
most
appropriate.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
in
this
situation,
justice
ginsburg,
a
board
of
inquiry
has
been
appointed,
taken
evidence,
and
is
in
the
process
of
taking
more
evidence
to
present
to
the
governor
of
the
state
of
missouri.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
same
status,
yes,
justice.
whether...
they
may
have
taken
more
information
in
since
certiorari
was
granted
by
this
court,
but
the
panel,
it's
a
three-judge
panel,
three
retired
judges
from...
state
court
judges,
taking
information
to
make
a
recommendation
to
the
governor.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
there
has
been
no
stay
in
that
whatsoever.
that's
a
nonjudicial
proceeding.
it
is
the
governor
reaching
out
to
attempt
to
get
more
information
in
this
situation,
and
asking
three
retired
judges
to
review
this
type
of
things,
evidence,
affidavits
and
other
matters
that
are
coming
forward
daily.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
yes,
your
honor,
we
agree
wholeheartedly
that
it
is
a
gate
that's
tough
to
get
through.
it
is
a
big
gate,
but
behind
the
gate
there
are
no
claims.
for
example,
the
question
was
asked
earlier
by
justice
souter
concerning
the
claim
at
the
district
court,
and
i
would
like
to
read
just
one
sentence
from
the
district
court's
finding
where,
contrary
to
appellant's
counsel,
the
district
court...
and
i
quote,
"thus,
nothing
in
the
record
supports
petitioner's
contention
that
the
exculpatory
evidence
petitioner
relies
on
even
exists.
"
"careful
review
of
the
interview
transcript
submitted
by
petitioner
does
not
alter
this
conclusion.
"
the
brady
claim--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--yes,
your
honor,
i
would
agree
that
the
appeal
dealt
with
the
gateway
issue,
but
the
underlying
claim
of
brady
was
dealt
with
by
that--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--yes,
if
he
gets
through
the
door,
your
honor,
he's
entitled...
that's
what
the
door
gets
him.
once
he
gets
there,
i
think...
if
i'm
proper
in
understanding
the
question
of
justice
ginsburg,
it
would
be
that
there's
not
much
behind
the
gate
on--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
what's
behind
the
gateway,
the
brady
as
well
as
the
ineffective--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
confident
it's
been
preserved
adequately
in
this
particular
matter.
i
think
that
the
theory
has
evolved
into
ineffective
being
the
more
primary
of
those
particular
two
gateway
claims,
although
one
could
argue
from
the
eighth
opinion
that
there
is
a
hook
regarding
a
brady
claim
in
there.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
your
honor--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--your
honor,
i
think
that
you
can
talk
about
both.
it
certainly
would
be
easier
if
there
weren't
both.
it
would
help
in
demystifying
this
entire
area.
but
i
don't
think
that,
especially
in
what
we're
dealing
with
here,
which
is,
you
know,
a
successive
or
abusive,
having
a
high
standard
to
get
through
the
gateway,
having
a
higher
standard
than
what
is
necessary
to
meet,
for
example,
you
know,
strickland
prejudice
and
all
the
other
things
that
are
underneath
that,
it's
not
improper,
especially
if
one's
reading
of
herrera
is
that
they
may
be
the
truly
extraordinary
case
out
there
that
can
run
around
the
gateway.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
i
think
another
important
point
to
make
here
in
this
case
is
that
petitioner
is
arguing
for
two
separate
standards,
and
it
doesn't
make
good
sense
from
a
policy
or
a
precedent
standpoint.
a
uniform
standard
for
guilt
and
penalty
phases,
and
guilt
and
penalty
regardless
of
whether
it's
a
capital
case,
is
much
easier
for
the
lower
courts,
especially
in
situations
where
we
get
eleventh-hour
situations
such
as
the
one
that's
presented
here,
and
also
issues
of
guilt
and
penalty
aren't
always
different,
as
was
mentioned
in
prior
questions.
penalty
claims
could
be
repackaged
and
relitigated
as
guilt
claims
in
the
process.
run
it
up
the
flag
pole
the
first
time
and
try
it
again
under
the
lower,
colorable
standard.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
justice
souter,
i
would
admit
that
there
is
a
subjective
element
to
a
jury
making
a
determination
between
life
in
prison
or
death.
however,
on--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--certainly.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
that
portion
of
it
is,
your
honor,
but
the
determination
made
under
sawyer
of
aggravating
circumstance,
of
the
objective
proof
necessary
to
prove
an
objective
factor
making
someone
eligible
for
the
death
penalty,
is
not,
in
your
estimation,
different
from
what's
necessary
to
prove
their
guilt.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
yes,
your
honor,
unless
you
find
that
so
narrow
a
holding
of
the
sawyer
is
that
it
just
deals
with
capital
cases
just
on
the
issue
of
death,
but
i
think
if
you
bring
it
to
the
context
of
penalty
and
guilt,
and
intermesh
it
into
a
system,
that
those
same
arguments
are
not
strong.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
yes,
your
honor,
there
would
be
some
standard.
we
think
the
sawyer--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--one
could
argue
the
sawyer
standard,
in
dealing
with
successive
and
abusive,
and
setting
a
standard
of
clear
and
convincing,
a
case
for
that.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
none
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
it
is
also
important
to
note,
as
was
raised
by
justice
o'connor
earlier
in
the
argument,
that
the
strickland
reasonable
probability
test
is
eerily
close
to
the
fair
probability
test
of
the
kuhlmann
standard
here,
and
i
think
we
would
all
argue
that
it
is
important
to
have
a
tougher
test
for
the
probable
actual-innocence,
miscarriage-of-justice
exception
than
it
is
for
the
cause-and-prejudice
end
of
this,
and
the
difference...
we
have
struggled
trying
to
figure
out
the
difference
between
reasonable
probability
and
fair
probability,
and
have
unsuccessfully
done
that,
and
i
believe
that
the
lower
courts
have
unsuccessfully
also
been
able
to
grapple
with
the
distinction
between
those
two.
kuhlmann
is
just
way
too
close
to
reasonable
probability
and,
for
that
matter,
too
close
to
the
new
trial
standard,
the
probably--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--one
could
read
it
that
way,
your
honor.
that
is
an
extremely
difficult
read
at
the
trial
bench.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
i
don't
mean
hard
to
do,
i
just
mean
because...
excuse
me.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
i
was
relying...
i
was
referring
to
the
standard,
your
honor,
not
to
the
ultimate
decision,
which
obviously
they're
fully
capable
of
making,
but
the
standard
being
so
eerily
close.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
if
you
draw
that
distinction,
your
honor,
then
it
is
much
easier
to
come
to
the
conclusion
you
did,
but
i
would
submit
that
the
fair
probability
standard
of
kuhlmann
is
difficult
to
ascertain,
regardless
of
what
words
you
put
behind
it.
fair
probability,
fair...
they
say
there
was
a
fair
probability
of
rain
today.
i
didn't
know
whether
to
bring
a
raincoat
or
not,
you
know,
and
that's
the
standard
that
the
petitioner
says
that
we
should
make
decisions
about
life
and
death
on.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
it's
that
the
sawyer
standard
is
better,
your
honor,
and
this
court
upheld
the
sawyer
standard
in
sawyer,
and
we
argue
that
sawyer
applies
already.
the
eighth
circuit
held
that,
and
we
are
here
arguing
for
the
clear-and-convincing
standard.
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
states
do
have
a
legitimate
interest
in
finality
in
these
particular
cases.
as
was
quoted
in
engle,
deterrence
depends
on
the
expectation
of
punishment.
the
trial
evidence,
the
main
event,
should
be
the
point
where
we
balance
and
look
and
scrutinize
evidence,
more
than
10
years
later,
looking
at
types
of
evidence
that
jumps
in.
we
shouldn't
reward
sand-bagging,
holding
back
of
information
and
using
that
at
later
proceedings.
i...
we
clearly
believe
that
victims,
juries,
and
communities
have
legitimate
punitive
interests
in
these
cases
coming
to
an
end,
and
to
have
a--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
ever
want
to
reward
sand-bagging,
and
i
think
we
should
never
reward
sand-bagging.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
well,
justice
scalia,
i
mean,
we're
arguing
for
the
clear-and-convincing
standard
in
this
particular
case.
that
is
a
standard
that
allows--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--in
this
case,
your
honor,
the
trial
court,
the
district
court,
has
held
that
the
defendant
themselves,
himself,
didn't
present
all
evidence
to
his
counsel,
and
therein
the
sand-bagging
also--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--well,
either
one.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
i
think
the
tactic
does
occur
out
there,
justice.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
no,
your
honor,
i
cannot.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
you're
close,
your
honor.
[laughter]
judge
friendly's
standard,
we
would
say,
is
a
good
standard
for
habeases,
and
would
argue
that
that's
what
kuhlmann
said.
if
you're
going
to
get...
make
it
through
there,
that
you've
got
to
have
a
colorable
showing,
and
that's
where
it
fits
in
the
process.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
i
believe
so--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--your
honor,
yes.
he
said,
to
all
habeas,
assuming
first.
he
talked
about
the
explosion
of
habeas
in
that
university
of
chicago
law
review
article
talking
about
as
many
as
400
or
500
cases
nationwide
in
a
year
at
that
time.
and
in
this
case,
it's
not,
it's
a
successive,
or
we're
later
on
in
the
process,
and
plus,
your
honor,
i
just
deeply
believe
that
the
fair
probability
standard
that
has
been
written
in
kuhlmann,
as
the
interpretation
of
what
friendly's
colorable
showing,
an
entertaining,
is
far
too
imprecise.
it
mirrors
the
strickland
test,
it
mirrors
the
new
trial
test,
it
doesn't
penalize
later
claims,
and
it
doesn't
set
a
line
for
trial
courts
and
appellate
courts
to
make
these
decisions,
and
thus,
i
think
it
makes
problems,
and
i
believe
that
it
doesn't
do
what
it's
designed
to
do.
maybe
if
it's
the
first
one,
it
makes
more
sense.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
yes.
therein
lies
the
issue
of
why
we're,
in
essence,
here
today
before
this
court,
is
to
finish
the
job.
sawyer
did
it
for
the
penalty
phase,
and
this
presents
the
opportunity
to
provide
that
same
standard,
that
clear
and
convincing
for
abusive
and
successive,
in
the
guilt
phase
of
these
cases
also,
to
draw
the
single
standard
across
the
line,
to
draw
one
that
provides
safeguards,
provides,
as
i
indicated
to
justice
scalia,
some
opportunities--
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
--generally
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
so
this
court
is
faced
with
the
opportunity
to
draw
that
line
at
the
point,
and
i
would
argue
that
it
did
it
already
in
sawyer,
dealing
with
objective,
specific
evidence.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
that
is
one
of
the
strong
arguments
for
a
high
standard.
mr.
jeremiah
w.
nixon
it's
not
precise
enough,
it's
not
high
enough,
and
it's
too
close
to
the
strickland
standard.
it
is
too
close
to
the
other
myriad
of
standards.
it
would
swallow
up
the
cause-and-prejudice
wing
of
the
miscarriage...
of
this
particular
habeas.
thank
you.
