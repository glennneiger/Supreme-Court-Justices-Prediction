all
right,
and
you
are
saying
that
this
is
a
successive
claim,
but
shouldn't
the
standard
employed
be
something
greater
than
the
cause-and-prejudice
requirement,
otherwise
the
two
just
are
subsumed
together?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
as
to
that,
it
ought
to
be
something,
some
standard
higher
than
merely
cause
and
prejudice,
i
would
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
part
of
the
problem,
because
the
kuhlmann
standard
may
actually
be
even
a
lesser
standard
than
cause
and
prejudice.
i
think
that's
not
clear
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
o'brien,
didn't
sawyer
apply
its
standard
to
both
guilt
and
penalty
phase
challenges
in
that
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
least,
the
court's
opinion
said
it
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you're
not
making
a
so-called
herrera-type
challenge
here.
you're
just
trying
to
use
this
as
a
door-opener
to
make
some
other
constitutional
challenge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
you
introduced
evidence
as
to
who
received
that
call
and
what
that
person
says?
