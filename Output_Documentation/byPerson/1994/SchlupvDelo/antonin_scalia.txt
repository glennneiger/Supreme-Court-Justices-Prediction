justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
this
was
withheld
from
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
are
you
saying
defense
counsel
was
incompetent,
that
he
didn't
have
proper
assistance
of
counsel?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
claim
made
earlier?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
made
in
a
prior
habeas?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
want
to
make
it
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
rejected
this
time,
you
would
be
able
to
make
it
again,
if
you
come
up
with
new
evidence
of
incompetence,
still.
i
assume
that's
your
position,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
see...
i
suppose
your
argument
also
is
that
you
wouldn't
have
to
present
the
brady
claim
in
order,
so
long
as
it's
still
alive,
to
challenge
the
prior
question
of
the
district
court's
using
the
wrong
gateway?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
used
the
wrong
gateway,
then
it
would
be
sent
back
down
for
proper
consideration
of
the
brady
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
brady
claim
was
still
alive,
but
you
didn't
have
to
argue
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
o'brien,
whichever
standard
we
use
of
the
two,
effectively
there
is
no
finality.
we're
saying
whatever
standard
you
must
use
you
must
always,
even
if
it's
the
150th
habeas...
you're
saying
the
district
court
must
always
conduct
a
merits
inquiry
to
determine
whether
there's
a
probability
of
innocence
or
whatever
other
standard
you
want
to
use,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
contrary
to
what
the
common
law
used
to
be.
i
mean,
we
used
to
have
a
thing
called
finality.
you've
had
your
shot
at
proving
your
innocence.
you've
been
found
guilty.
of
course
you
come
in
and
say
you're
innocent,
but
we've
had
a
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
how
you
can
tell
whether
the
standard
is
met
without
having
a
hearing
on
the
facts
of
guilt
or
innocence.
then
you
decide
whether
it's
been
proved
properly
or
not.
but
you're
reopening
the
whole
merits
thing.
now,
i
can
see
that,
in
the
first
habeas,
but
you're
saying,
thereafter,
as
many
times
as
it
comes
forward,
the
judge
has
to
go
through
the
process
of
having
a
hearing
to
decide
whether,
indeed,
whatever
standard
you
pick
has
been
met.
justice
antonin
scalia
regardless
of
how
strong
it
is,
you
can't
tell
how
strong
it
is
until
you
have
the
hearing.
justice
antonin
scalia
who
was
mr.
green?
justice
antonin
scalia
general
nixon,
do
you,
especially
if
we
adopt
the
standard
that
you
propose,
do
you
really
seriously
think
we're
talking
about
a
gateway
here?
i
mean,
do
you
expect
that
line
to
hold,
that
federal
courts
will
be
able
to
say,
yes,
there
is
an
overwhelming
probability
of
innocence
here,
but,
as
it
happens,
there
was
no
constitutional
violation,
and
therefore
this
person
will
have
to
serve
out
the
rest
of
his
100-year
sentence,
or
be
put
to
death?
unfortunately,
in
all
likelihood
he's
innocent,
but
the
technical
requirement
of
a
constitutional
violation
has
not
been--
will
that
line
hold?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
we
either
have
to
stop
talking
about
gateways
or
stop
talking
about
the
high
standard
that
you
propose,
one
or
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
be
astounded
if
that
line
held,
really
be
astounded.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
nixon,
you
really,
you
don't
want
to
quibble
about
the
principle,
you're
just
concerned
about
the
standard,
but
you
concede
that,
on
a
successive
habeas
claim,
no
matter
how
far
down
it
may
be,
there
has
to
be
at
least
some
possibility,
under
some
standard,
of
reraising
the
claim
of
innocence?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
case
of
ours
holds
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
standard
reaches
a
result
that
would
not
have
been
reached
but
for
that
possibility
of
being
able
to
raise
claims
of
innocence
in
subsequent
habeas
petitions?
or,
to
put
it
more
precisely,
what
case
of
ours
holds
that
the
prior
common
law
rule
that
a
successive
habeas
petition
may
be...
need
not
be...
if
the
district
court
wants
to
entertain
it,
it
may,
but
that
a
successive
habeas
petition
may
always
be
dismissed
by
the
district
judge
simply
on
the
ground
it
is
successive,
period?
what
case
of
ours
holds
to
the
contrary
of
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
we
should
reward
sand-bagging
only
when
there's,
what,
compelling
evidence
of
innocence?
you're
wanting
to
reward
it
then,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
--draw
that
objection
to
the
other
standard.
i
mean,
we're
just
talking
about
when
to
reward
it,
not
whether,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
he
was
applying
it
to
first
habeas
actually,
wasn't
he,
in
his
article--
justice
antonin
scalia
--friendly?
