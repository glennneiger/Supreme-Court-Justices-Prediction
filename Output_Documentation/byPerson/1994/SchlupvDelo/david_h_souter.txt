justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
interrupt
you,
because
there's
another
point
i
think
we
should
be
clear
on.
the
brady
claim
was
not
determined
below,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
even
if
we
assume
strickland
was,
brady
was
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
o'brien,
going
to
the
gateway
standard,
do
you
read
kuhlmann
and
carrier
as
establishing
or
affirming
equivalent
tests?
kuhlmann
speaks
of
fair
probability
of
reasonable
doubt,
carrier
speaks
of
probability
of
innocence.
are
those
two
cases
referring
to
the
same
standard?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
a
difference,
at
least
as...
taking
the
carrier
formulation,
is
there
a
difference
between
that
and
what
might
rise
to
the
level
of
a
herrera
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
any
case,
you'll
settle
for
the
carrier
formulation?
justice
david
h.
souter
aren't
you
claiming
that
they
didn't
apply
it,
that
in
fact
they
applied
jackson?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
green's
case,
i
take
it
your
argument
is
not
that
the
petitioner
must
be
innocent
if
green
is
telling
the
truth,
but
that
green
couldn't
be
telling
the
truth
because
what
he
says
is
inconsistent
with
other
evidence,
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
the
evidence
is
going
to
be
evaluated,
and
it
were
accepted,
if
green
were
accepted
and
your
argument
for
impossibility
fails
in
the
mind
of
the
fact-finder,
then
the
conclusion
would
follow
that
the
petitioner
was
innocent?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
no,
i
think
i
understand
your
argument.
i
wanted
to
make
sure
that
i
did
understand
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
may
be
right
or
it
may
be
wrong,
but
that
isn't
what
the
appeal
was
concerned
with,
was
it?
i
mean,
that
issue
was
never
litigated
on
appeal.
the
appeal
turned
on
the
gate
question,
the
door
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
he's
entitled
to
have
an
appeal
on
it
if
he
gets
through
the
door.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't
it
also
the
case
that
in
any
ultimate
resolution
of
the
penalty
phase
there
is
a
kind
of
value
judgment
goes
with
it,
that
is
made
by
the
sentencer,
which
is
different
from
the
kind
of
factual
discretion,
or
a
discretion
to
find
fact,
which
is
the
essence
of
the
guilt
phase
determination?
i
mean,
there
are
different
kinds
of
judgments,
depending
on
whether
we're
dealing
with
guilt
or
whether
we're
dealing
with
penalty.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
not
merely
subjective.
it
involves
the
imposition
of
values.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
at
some
point
a
determination
must
be
made
as
to
whether,
for
example,
the
aggravating
circumstances
and
all
the
other
evidence
in
the
case
merits
a
certain
penalty
or
whether
it
doesn't,
and
that
is
a
different
kind
of
determination
from
the
guilt
determination,
which
in
essence
is
what
happened?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
is
in
some
cases
going
to
be
true,
but
the
ultimate
determination
that
has
to
be
made
in
a
sawyer
kind
of
case
is
a
determination
which
must
take
into
consideration
the
ultimate
discretion
to
make
a
value
judgment
as
distinct
from
the
discretion
to
make
a
factual
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
going
to
be
true
in
every
sawyer
case
regardless
of
how
the
sawyer
case,
particularly,
is
presented.
justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me,
general.
may
the
answer
to
that
be
the
difference
between
the
kuhlmann
formulation
and
the
carrier
formulation,
because
the
kuhlmann
formulation
goes
to,
i
guess,
fair
probability
of
reasonable
doubt,
whereas
carrier
talks
about
probability
of
innocence,
and
one
could
see,
and
i'm
not
saying
that
under
our
cases
one
should,
but
one
could
see
the
distinction
as
being
the
distinction
between
legal
innocence
and
factual
innocence,
and
if
carrier
were
read
in
the
latter
sense,
then
the
carrier
formulation
would
provide
the
distinction
that
you're
arguing
for,
and
your
opposing
counsel
says
he
would
accept
that
as
being
appropriate.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
is
it
difficult?
i
mean,
most
trial
judges
can
tell
the
difference
between
somebody
who
committed
the
act
but
has
not
been
shown
to
have
done
so
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
somebody
who
in
the
classic
case
wasn't
there.
that's
not
hard.
that
distinction
isn't
hard
to
draw.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
was
talking,
one
standard
talks
about
reasonable
doubt,
one
standard
talks
about
innocence.
why
are
they
hard
to
separate,
if
we
make
it
clear
that
there
is
this
distinction
between
legal
and
factual
innocence?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
petitioner
said
that
he
would
take
the
carrier
formulation.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
your
concern,
then,
is
not
with
the
difficulty
of
the
standard.
i
mean,
if
the
standard
is
not
too
imprecise
in
round
1,
it's
not
too
imprecise
for
round
2.
you
want
a
higher
standard
for
round
2
because
there's
been
a
round
1.
that's
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
true,
i
mean,
if
the
standard
is
too
imprecise
for
round
2,
it's
too
imprecise
for
round
1,
and
if
it's
okay
for
round
1,
why
isn't
it
okay
for
round
2?
