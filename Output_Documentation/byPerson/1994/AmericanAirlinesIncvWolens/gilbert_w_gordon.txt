mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
contrary
to
mr.
ennis'
argument
this
morning,
these
claims
were
never
considered
by
the
dot.
that
case,
which
is
part
of
the
record,
that
dot
decision
was
a
coupon
broker
rulemaking
petition
where
the
reasonableness
or
unreasonableness
of
those
capacity
control
restrictions
and
those
black-out
date
restrictions
were
at
issue,
and
it
is
important
to
note
that
in
that
proceeding,
american
opposed
the
rulemaking.
american
opposed
having
the
department
of
transportation
regulate
frequent
flyer
programs.
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
not
asserting
a
direct
right
to
a
particular
rate,
or
a
service.
even
under
the
test
proposed
by
mr.
ennis,
whether
it
has
a
significant
impact
on
competitive
decisions,
the
claims
in
this
case
would
still
not
be
preempted.
the
fundamental
question
that
must
be
answered
by
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
illinois
courts
are
precluded
from
enforcing
contracts
which
airlines
voluntarily
enter
into
with
other
parties.
this
case
comes
before
the
court
at
the
pleading
stage.
it's
based
on
a
complaint
alleging
such
a
contract.
our
contract
happens
to
involve
a
frequent
flyer
program.
it
could
involve
food
service,
the
purchase
of
gasoline,
passenger
terms...
it
doesn't
matter.
congress
did
not
intend
to
preempt
these
voluntary
agreements.
no
matter
what
american
argues
in
this
case,
they
believe
they
have
the
right
to
enter
into
enforceable
contracts.
they
enter
into
these
contracts
all
the
time,
and
they
file
lawsuits
all
over
the
united
states
trying
to
enforce
them.
it
is
curious
that
in
all
of
the
litigation
filed
by
american
which
is
noted
in
our
brief,
and
there
are
literally
tens
of
other
cases
they've
filed,
that
american
did
not
find
themselves
barred
by
the
doctrine
of
preemption.
if
american's
position
is
correct,
they
cannot
sue,
either,
to
enforce
their
contracts.
the
enforceability
of
contracts
was
not
addressed
by
this
court
in
morales,
a
case
where
a
group
of
state
attorney
generals
sought
to
regulate
fair
advertising.
this
case
is
clearly
not
morales,
and
it
requires
a
different
analysis.
as
this
court
stated
in
cipollone
less
than
a
month
after
morales
was
decided,
liability
for
breach
of
contract
is
measured
by
the
terms
of
the
contract.
voluntary
agreements
involve
duties
undertaken
by
the
contracting
parties
rather
than
those
imposed
by
state
law.
such
contracts
can
be
enforced
without
undoing
or
undermining
the
federal
deregulatory
scheme.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
well,
injunctive
relief
in
certain
cases
could
be
regulatory
if
it
were
to
undo
or
undermine
the
federal
deregulatory
scheme,
but
as
a
general
rule,
if
the
type
of
injunctive
relief
we
are
talking
about
would
be
specific
performance,
that
should
be
a
means
of
enforcing
a
contract,
unless
it
undermines
the
federal
deregulatory
scheme.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
that
is
correct.
we
are
no
longer
pressing
such
a
claim,
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
well,
justice
souter,
as
the
court
noted
in
both
silkwood
and
cipollone,
punitive
damages
are
not
necessarily
regulatory.
there
could
be
certain
cases--
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
--we
aren't
seeking
punitive
damages.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
well,
only
to
the
extent
that
punitive
damages,
justice
souter,
would
have
a
direct
impact
on
the
deregulatory
scheme,
which
they
often
would,
and
in
those
instances
they
would
be
preempted.
but
there
are
circumstances...
for
example,
in
tort
cases...
where
punitive
damages
would
really
not
impact
on
the
deregulatory
scheme
and
therefore
would
not
be
preempted
nor
regulatory,
so
i
don't
think
there
can
be
a
hard
and
fast
rule
that
punitive
damages
would
be
preempted,
but
they're
generally
not
available
in
contract
claims
for
breach
of
contract.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
it
does
make
a
difference
in
how
they
impact
on
the
federal
deregulatory
scheme,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
not
that
if
it
has
an
impact,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
if
it
undoes
or
undermines
the
federal
deregulatory
scheme,
there
could
be
circumstances
where
even
a
voluntary
agreement
would
have
to
be
preempted.
if
it
were
so
interrelated
to
the
operation
of
the
airline
and
to
how
they
do
price
their
product,
then
there
could
be
a
circumstance,
for
example
a...
the
situation
that
the
solicitor
general
raised
on
the
unconscionability
defense
on
a
contract
claim.
there
are
certain
situations,
and
they're
very
rare,
but
as
a
general
rule
we
do
not
believe
that
would
exist.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
i
don't
believe--
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
--justice
o'connor,
if
you
were
to
look
at
the
program
brochure
in
our
lawsuit,
the
allegations
of
the
pleading,
you
will
note
that
if
you
get
a
certain
number
of
mileage
credits,
one
of
the
many
awards,
perhaps
30
or
40
possibilities,
is
a
free
airline
ticket.
a
free
ticket
is
defined,
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
word
"free"
in
the
dictionary
is
"without
charge".
it
is
clearly
not
a
rate.
it's
an
award
for
your
brand
loyalty.
it
doesn't
matter
if
you
get
that
mileage
credit
by
staying
in
a
hotel,
renting
a
car,
using
a
charge
card,
calling
someone
on
a
long
distance
telephone
network,
purchasing
merchandise
out
of
a
catalogue,
or
putting
money
in
a
particular
american
airlines
money
market
fund.
there
are
many
ways
of
obtaining
the
mileage
credits,
and
they
can
be
used
for
a
number
of
awards,
some
of
which
involve
airline
travel
and
some
do
not.
we
do
not
believe
that
any
relationship
to
rates
would
be
more
than
tenuous,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
justice
kennedy,
i
don't
know
what
most
people
say,
but
i
believe
that
the
terms
which
are
before
the
court
indicate
that
if
you
get
a
certain
number
of
mileage
credits
you
get
a
free
ticket,
not
that
you
pay
with
another
form
of
currency
not
recognizable
in
the
united
states.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
justice
breyer,
we
would
suggest
that
as
a
general
rule
voluntary
agreements
should
not
be
preempted
under
section
1305
because
it's
clear
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
preempt
them,
but
that
in
the
rare
circumstance
where
a
voluntary
agreement
undermines
the
federal
deregulatory
scheme,
then
that
should
be
preempted.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
well,
the--
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
--well,
justice
breyer,
the
dot's
jurisdiction
is,
of
course,
discretionary
and
nonexclusive,
so
the
dot
can
take
jurisdiction
of
the
subject
matter,
and
that's
an
interesting
response
to
why
american
would
not
be
subjected
to
unreasonable
laws
of
50
states.
if
there
were
a
circumstance
where
the
laws
of
all
the
states
were
so
diverse
as
to
be
unduly
burdensome
on
american,
they
could
go
to
the
department
of
transportation,
they
could
ask
for
a
rule
on
that
subject
matter,
and
that
rule
would
take
precedence
over
the
state
law.
so
consequently,
i
think
that
the
department
of
transportation's
jurisdiction
coexists,
except
to
the
extent
that
there
is
no
authority
in
the
department
of
transportation
to
award
compensatory
damages
for
breach
of
contract.
it's
simply
not
there.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
well,
i
think
that
the
case
should
just
be
affirmed,
it
would
go
back
to
the
trial
court,
and
if,
on
appeal
again,
there
were
some
imposition
of
state
law
that
the
dot
or
american
airlines
felt
related
to
rates,
routes,
or
services,
some
state
theory,
then
they
would
have
that
ground
for
appeal
at
another
time.
we're
at
the
pleading
stage
here.
sending
it
back
now
to
examine
that
issue,
the
illinois
court
would
only
look
at
the
same
complaint
that
this
court
looks
at,
but
if
it
were
to
go
back
up
through
the
system,
yes,
they
would
have
the
right
to
appeal
preemption
issues
if
the
court
were
to
set
a
guideline
and
say
that
the
imposition
of
state
theory
can
be
preempted.
if
that
were
to
occur
in
our
case,
and
we
don't
believe
it
would,
that
would
be
a
relevant
factor.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
our
brief
was
not
as
clear,
justice
ginsburg,
because
that's
not
our
case.
our
case
is
an
express
contract,
a
simple
contract,
and
there
is
no
imposition
of
state
theory
or
state
policy.
but
in
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question,
i
was
extending
the
principle
to
potential
future
cases,
but
in
our
case
we
don't
believe
that's
any
issue
at
all.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
preemption...
maybe
i
mis...
wasn't
clear
in
answering
that
question.
i
don't
believe
that
that
concurrent
jurisdiction
would
have
the
dot
making
decisions
as
to
what's
preempted
or
what's
not
preempted.
i
believe
that's
a
function
of
the
courts.
the
dot--
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
--we
would
turn
to
the
statute
and
the
dot
regulation
would
supersede,
if
it
were
the
same
subject,
the
state
law,
yes.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
well,
this
court
has
stated
many
times,
justice
kennedy,
that
contemporaneous
construction
by
an
administrative
agency
should
be
given
great
deference,
and
that's
all
we're
suggesting.
the
court
gave
deference
to
the
dot's
position
in
morales
and
also
to
that
of
the
ftc.
that
was
a
different
case.
in
our
case,
the
dot
believes,
and
we
believe,
that
the
appropriate
and
only
place
to
litigate
matters
involving
breach
of
voluntary
agreements
is
the
state
court.
make
no
mistake
about
it,
this
is
not
a
case
of
being
in
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court.
this
is
a
situation
unlike
many
of
the
other
preemption
statutes,
such
as
erisa,
where
it's
a
question
of
being
in
the
state
court
or
having
your
claim
extinguished.
there
is
no
claim
if
this
case
is
preempted.
there
is
no
claim
before
the
dot,
there
is
no
claim
in
the
federal
court,
and
there
is
no
claim
in
the
state
court.
these
people
are
clearly
without
a
remedy.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine
would
not
be
strictly
applicable
here
because
the
dot's
jurisdiction
in
these
cases
is
discretionary
and
nonexclusive.
we
believe
the
better
function
of
the
dot
in
these
types
of
cases
would
be
in
the
circumstance
that
if
the
airline
felt
they
were
being
unfairly
subjected
or
burdened
by
this
plethora
of
state
law
that
they
would
seek
rulemaking.
they
are
in
a
position
to
seek
rulemaking
by
the
dot
on
some
issue
where
they
believe
that
they
are
being
unduly
burdened
by
these
numerous
state
laws,
so
i
don't
agree
to
that
extent
that
there
would
be
concurrent
jurisdiction.
i
think
that
would
be--
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
--yes,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
we
disagree
with
the
government
on
that
point
because
we
do
not
believe
our
consumer
fraud
act
claim
relates
to
the
rates,
routes,
and
services
in
more
than
a
tenuous
manner.
our
argument
is
limited
to
that
on
the
consumer
fraud.
we
don't
believe
that
there's
some
general
rule
necessary
that
consumer
fraud
claims
are
not
preempted
because
they
don't
always
involve
the
voluntary
agreement
of
the
parties,
and
they
involve
unfair
and
deceptive
practices
which
are,
of
course,
the
subject
matter
of
dot
jurisdiction,
so
to
the
extent
that
our
consumer
fraud
claim
does
not
relate
to
the
rates,
routes,
or
services
in
more
than
a
tenuous
manner,
we
do
not
believe
it
should
be
preempted.
the
reservation
of
the
right
to
change
the
program
mentioned
by
mr.
ennis
is
clearly
an
enforceable
provision,
although
not
really
important,
in
my
view,
before
this
court.
it's
enforceable
based
on
what
it
says
and
what
it
doesn't
say,
and
that
would
be
for
the
state
court
to
determine.
we
believe
it's
an
unambiguous
provision
that
they
had
the
right
to
change
the
program
prospectively
only.
american
ignores
the
irrefutable
argument
that
they
could
always
impose
capacity
control
restrictions
prospectively,
because
they
had
always
reserved
for
themselves
the
right
to
do
so.
it
is
the
retroactive
effect
of
capacity
control
restrictions
after
the
consumer
has
performed
his
end
of
the
bargain
that
we
are
claiming
in
our
complaint
is
a
breach
of
contract.
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
dot
does
not
provide
for
a
remedy
for
these
claimants.
the
federal
aviation
act
provides
for
public
enforcement
of
the
act,
not
for
remedies
for
private
parties.
no
money
damages
or
other
restitution
are
available
to
a
private
party,
and
while
the
millions
of
plaintiffs
in
this
class
might
each
have
filed
a
rulemaking
petition
before
the
dot
claiming
an
unfair
or
a
deceptive
practice,
they
could
not
even
make
such
an
administrative
charge
for
breach
of
contract,
and
even
if
they
could,
the
only
remedies
provided
for
in
the
faa
are
for
the
imposition
of
penalties
or
injunctive
relief.
for
the
dot
to
have
the
authority
under
any
scenario
to
enforce
breach
of
contract
claims
they
would
necessarily
have
to
have
jurisdiction
over
all
of
the
parties
to
a
contract.
the
dot
would
have
no
jurisdiction
if
american
airlines
wanted
to
sue
a
consumer,
because
the
dot
has
no
jurisdiction
over
the
individual,
only
the
airline,
so
it
would
really
be
impossible
for
the
dot
to
have
authority
to
adjudicate
breach
of
contract
claims.
contracts
are
prominently
mentioned
in
the
airline
deregulation
act.
it
is
inconceivable
that
congress
intended
for
there
to
be
contracts
without
providing
or
envisioning
a
mechanism
to
enforce
contracts.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
justice
o'connor--
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
--i
only
disagree
to
the
extent
the
authority
in
that
area
that
the
dot
has
is
limited
to
unfair
or
deceptive
practices.
a
breach
of
contract
may
rise
to
that
level.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
i
believe
the
department
of
transportation
has
the
authority
if
they
found
it
to
be
an
unfair
or
deceptive
practice.
i
do
not
believe
they
have
the
authority,
and
they
don't
profess
to
have
the
authority
nor
the
desire
to
make
these
types
of
determinations
in
simple
breach
of
contract
actions.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
they
would
have
the
authority
to
enter
such
a
rule,
yes,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
it
isn't
the
relief
that
we
are
distinguishing,
it
is
the
relationship
to
rates,
routes,
and
services.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
one
relates
to
the
agreement
of
the
parties,
the
other
is
an
imposition
of
state
law
on
deceptive
practices.
that's
the
only
distinguishing
feature
i
would
suggest,
justice
stevens.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
we
do
not
abandon
it.
we
believe
that
it
does
not
more
than
tenuously
relate
to
the
rates,
routes,
or
services
of
the
airline,
but
we
do
not
believe
and
do
not
profess
that
there
should
be
some
general
rule
that
consumer
fraud
claims
are
not
preempted.
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
the
result
in
a
necessary
corollary
of
a
finding
of
preemption
in
this
case
would
be
that
the
tort
claims
which
will
next
reach
this
court
must
also
be
preempted.
the
fifth
circuit
is
awaiting
a
rehearing
en
banc
in
hodges
v.
delta
airlines
involving
a
preemption
of
a
negligence
claim.
the
court
should
understand
that
this
case
cannot
be
decided
in
isolation.
there
must
be
a
ruling
that
contracts
in
tort
claims
were
not
intended
to
be
preempted
by
congress,
and
it
is
consistent,
that
position
is
consistent
with
the
statutory
language
of
the
ada.
the
mechanisms
for
enforcement
of
a
contract
only
exist
in
state
law,
and
section
1506,
which
saves
these
common
law
claims,
would
have
to
be
written
completely
out
of
the
statute
if
the
court
were
to
preempt
contract
and
tort
claims,
because
without
contract
and
tort
claims--
mr.
gilbert
w.
gordon
--i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
you
should
look
very
deeply
into
mr.
ennis'
position
that
they're
tenuously
related
to
the
rates,
routes,
and
services
of
an
airline.
i
can't
think
of
anything
more
closely
related
to
the
services
of
an
airline
than
safety
inspections
of
the
aircraft,
and
for
mr.
ennis
to
conclude
that
that
has
a
tenuous
relationship
to
the
rates,
routes,
and
services
of
the
airline
while
a
voluntary
agreement
for
a
marketing
promotion,
a
gimmick
where
they
have
all
these
partners
and
mileage
credits
being
accumulated,
is
more
closely
related
is
an
untenable
argument,
in
my
view.
thank
you.
