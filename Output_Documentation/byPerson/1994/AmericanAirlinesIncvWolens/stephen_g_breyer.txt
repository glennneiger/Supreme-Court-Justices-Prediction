stephen
g.
breyer
well,
can
i...
i
wanted
to
know
what...
you
can't
have
competition,
can
you,
without
contracts
that
are
enforceable,
so
how
could
this
act
be
aiming
at
competition
and
services
unless
it
has
a...
unless
it
foresees
enforceable
contracts--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
the
dot
isn't
given
authority
to
enforce
contracts.
the
dot
is
given
authority
to
deal
with
deceptive
practices.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
doesn't
say
enforce
contracts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
true
that
something
could
be
a
breach
of
contract
and
also
be
a
deceptive
service.
i
mean,
it
could
be
deceptive
and
a
breach
of
contract,
but
you
could
have
breach
of
contracts
that
are
not
consumer
deception,
and
so
how
do
those
things
relate?
does
primary
jurisdiction
help?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the
general
relationship?
that
is
to
say,
does
primary
jurisdiction
help?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
your
suggestion
as
to
how
you
separate
the
sheeps
from
the
goats?
i
mean,
the
sheep
are
simply
the
ordinary
agreements
that
you
have
to
have
enforceable
to
have
any
competition
at
all.
the
goats
are
the
use
of
the
state
contract
law
to
impose
all
kinds
of
impediments
to
competition
by
saying,
for
example...
i
mean,
there
are
dozens
in
the
briefs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine,
and
then
how
do
you
distinguish
those
two,
and
do
you
have
primary
jurisdiction
to
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
leave
it
up
to
the
dot?
do
you...
how
does...
i
was
interested
in
the
primary
jurisdiction
part.
it
seemed
to
me
that
might
provide
an
answer,
and
i'd
like
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
here
you'd
follow
the
sg's
approach?
i
mean,
is...
it
would
be
your
argument
we'd
send
this
back,
and
if
it
turns
out
that
they're
using
something
other
than
simple,
straightforward
contract
principles
to
decide
this
case,
that
then,
what,
we'd
ask
dot?
how
would
it
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
understandably
worried
about
your
own
case,
which
i
understand,
but
the
thing
that's
difficult
for
me
is
exactly
the
same
line
of
questioning.
that
is,
it
would
make
sense
if
in
this
borderline
area,
where
there's
the
risk
that
the
contract
law
would
so
be
interpreted
as
to
interfere
with
competition,
to
consult
dot,
and
that's
why
i
was
intrigued
by
their
notion
of
primary
jurisdiction,
but
i'm
worried
about
the
statute
and
how
this
would
actually
work.
you
may
not
have
thought
this
out,
and
i
don't
expect
you
to,
necessarily,
but
if
you
can,
it
might
be
helpful.
