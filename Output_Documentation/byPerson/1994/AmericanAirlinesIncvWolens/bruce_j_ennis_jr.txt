mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
airline
deregulation
act
categorically
preempts
any
state
law
relating
to
airline
rates,
routes,
and
services.
in
1988,
american
airlines
decided
to
change
the
rate
for
purchasing
tickets
through
its
frequent
flyer
program.
respondents
challenged
that
decision
on
state
law
grounds.
they
claim
state
law
overrides
american's
express
reservation
of
the
right
to
change
frequent
flyer
rules
and
awards
at
any
time,
and
gives
respondents
a
right
to
purchase
tickets
at
the
rate
in
effect
before
the
change.
in
morales,
this
court
ruled
that
the
ada
broadly
preempts
state
laws
whose
enforcement
would
have
a
connection
with
rates,
routes,
or
services.
that
test
requires
preemption
of
respondent's
statutory
and
common
law
claims.
enforcement
of
either
claim
would
have
a
direct
impact
on
american's
rates
because
it
would
require
american
to
rescind
its
system-wide
rate
decision
or
pay
substantial
damages.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
in
morales
this
court
ruled
that
not
every
claim
that
literally
relates
to
rates,
routes,
and
services
is
preempted.
some
claims
will
have
too
tenuous
an
effect.
we
believe
that
those
kinds
of
safety
claims
would
generally
not
be
preempted.
there
are
also
indications
in
the
text
of
the
ada
and
in
the
structure
of
the
ada
that--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
the
morales
test
stands
for
two
propositions.
first,
claims
are
preempted
if
the
claims
assert
a
direct
right
to
a
particular
rate,
route,
or
service,
and
those
kinds
of
safety
claims
would
not.
the
claims
in
this
case
would.
second,
under
the
tenuousness
exception
of
morales,
claims
that
would
have
an
indirect
effect
on
rates,
routes,
and
services
are
preempted,
but
not
if
they're
too
tenuous.
in
our
view,
the
way
to
understand
that
is
to
say
that
claims
will
generally
be
preempted
if
their
indirect
effect
will
have
a
significant
impact
on
competitive
decision-making
regarding
rates,
routes,
or
services.
if
they
are
not
likely
to
have
a
significant
effect
on
competitive
decision-making,
then
they
are
probably
going
to
be
too
tenuous
to
warrant
preemption.
that
test,
impact
on
competitive
decision-making,
is
consistent
with
both
the
text
of
the
ada
and
the
legislative
purpose,
which
was
to
place
maximum
reliance
on
competitive
decision-making
on
market
forces.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
the
actual
formulation
of
the
test
in
morales
was
not
mentioned.
morales
simply
said
that
claims
will
not
be
preempted
if
their
effect
on
rates,
routes,
and
services
is
too
tenuous
or
peripheral.
we
have
attempted
to
formulate,
to
flesh
out
a
test
that
gives
meaning
to
the
tenuousness
exception
in
morales
that
is
consistent
with
the
text
and
with
the
legislative
history,
and
in
our
view,
that
test,
impact
on
competitive
decision-making,
would
not
generally
preempt
most
safety
claims.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
generally,
your
honor,
those
kinds
of
denied
boarding
claims
will
be
preempted,
because
most
of
those
claims
will
assert
a
direct
right
to
a
particular
rate,
route,
or
service.
they
can't
be
considered
tenuous
in
any
way.
however,
preemption
of
those
claims
will
not
leave
passengers
without
a
remedy,
and
will
not
create
a
major
administrative
burden
for
the
dot,
because
the
dot
has
already
issued
regulations
governing
denied
boarding
claims.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
what
the
person
does
is,
that
person
would
have
the
same
remedies
that
this
court
found
sufficient
in
morales
for
the
claims
that
were
preempted
there.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
well,
he
can
file
a...
first
attempt
to
negotiate
informally
with
the
airlines,
which
works
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
and
second
can
file
a
complaint
with
the
department
of
transportation.
the
department
has
ample
authority
to
redress
any
of
those...
those--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--yes,
they
have,
your
honor.
they
have
addressed
many.
in
fact,
the
very
claims
that
are
in
issue
in
this
case
have
actually
been
considered
by
the
department
of
transportation,
which
entertained
those
claims
but
denied
them
on
the
merits.
section
1381
gives
the
department
of
transportation--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
have
to
answer
that
in
two
ways.
i
think
that
most
claims
involving
luggage
would
not
be
preempted
under
our
test,
but
some
would.
let
me
explain.
if
the
claim
challenges
the
liability
limit
that
the
airline
has
set
for
lost
luggage
claims,
that
claim
would
be
preempted,
because
enforcement
of
that
claim
would
have
a
significant
impact
on
the
airline's
competitive
decision
regarding
what
the
appropriate
maximum
limit
should
be,
and
that's
consistent
with
dot
regulations
which
permit
airlines
to
set
maximum
limits
for
luggage
liability,
so
enforcement
of
that
claim
would
impede
federal
objectives
and
have
a
direct
impact.
but
if
all
we're
talking
about
is
the
value
of
a
particular
piece
of
luggage
within
that
limit,
those
kinds
of
claims
generally
would
not
be
preempted,
because
they
would
not
assert
a
right
to
a
particular
rate,
route,
or
service
directly,
and
their
indirect
connection
would
be
tenuous.
airlines
are
not
going
to
change
their
competitive
decisions
regarding
the
appropriate
liability
limit
just
because
a
state
court
decides
a
bag
is
worth
$300
instead
of
$200.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
let
me
try
to
answer
the
question
this
way.
that's
not
exactly
our
position.
our
position
is
that
the...
section
1305,
the
express
preemption
provision,
is
an
express
preemption
provision,
and
the
purpose
of
an
express
preemption
provision
is
to
preempt
all
laws
within
the
sphere
of
laws
whose
enforcement
might
interfere
with
federal
objectives.
this
is
not
actual
conflict
preemption,
this
is
an
express
preemption
clause,
so
generally
speaking,
the
answer
is
yes,
that
if
it
would
be
within
the
competence
of
the
dot
to
regulate,
it
could
be
preempted,
but
our
test
is
not
exactly
the
same.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
no.
in
fact,
the
whole
point
of
the
airline
deregulation
act
was
to
deregulate
the
authority
that
the
cab,
now
the
dot,
had
over
the
economic
aspects
of
air
transportation,
rates,
routes,
and
services.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
there
might
be
room
for
concurrent
jurisdiction
for
all
those
types
of
claims,
such
as
the
value
of
lost
luggage
claims,
that
would
not
impact
competitive
decision-making.
the
dot
could
certainly
come
in
and,
by
rule,
prescribe
a
uniform
rule
for
even
those
kinds
of
evaluation
claims
which
would
not,
in
our
view,
be
preempted
by
section
1305
itself.
the
point
of
the
deregulation
act
was
simply
to
take
away
regulation
of
the
economic
aspects
of
air
carriage
which
had
historically
been
supervised
by
the
cob...
cab,
now
dot.
it
was
not
intended
to
affect
in
any
way
safety
regulation
which
had
historically
been
supervised
by
the
faa.
in
fact--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--well,
justice
o'connor,
the
deregulation
act
really
had,
and
the
government
acknowledges
this,
three
distinct
purposes.
the
first
was
simply
deregulation,
get
state
governments
off
the
airlines'
backs
with
respect
to
rates,
routes,
and
services.
but
it
also
had,
as
a
goal
in
itself,
as
an
independent
purpose,
as
this
court
said
in
morales,
to
place
maximum
reliance
on
competitive
market
forces.
the
statute
says,
directs
the
dot,
even
in
exercising
the
considerable
regulatory
authority
which
it
still
retains,
to
exercise
that
authority
always
with
a
thumb
on
the
scales
in
favor
of
competitive
decision-making.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
that
would
be
a
very
difficult
question
about
whether
that
kind
of
regulation
would
be
so
inconsistent
with
the
statute
that
it
would
be
beyond
the
dot's
power.
i
think
for
claims
such
as
valuation
claims,
i
don't
see
any
problem
with
that,
because
i
don't
think
those
would
be
preempted.
for
claims
that
would
assert
direct
right
to
a
rate,
route,
or
service,
i
think
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
statutory
test
for
the
dot
to
say,
those
claims
which
are
clearly
preempted
by
the
text
of
the
statute
can
nevertheless
proceed
in
state
court.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
that's
very
similar
to
the
question
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist
asked,
and
our
answer
would
be
the
same.
for
all
of
those
denied
boarding
kinds
of
claims,
the
passenger
is
asserting
a
direct
right
to
a
particular
rate,
route,
or
service.
those
clearly
are
not
tenuously
connected
with
rates,
routes,
and
services.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
souter,
we
are
not
taking
the
position
that
those
kinds
of
contract
claims
cannot
be
enforced.
we
are
simply
taking
the
position--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--they
can
only
be
enforced
by
dot.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
they
have
on
several
occasions
enforced
contracts
like
that,
your
honor.
yes,
they
have.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
let
me
try
to
answer
the
question
this
way,
justice
souter.
the
united
states
agrees
with
american
that
respondent's
statutory
claim
for
damages
is
preempted
because
of
its
impact.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
the
consumer
protection
claim
under
the
illinois
statute--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--is
preempted
because
of
its
impact
on
american's
rates,
routes,
and
services.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's
essentially
the
government's
position,
your
honor,
but
there
are
two
things
to
be
said
about
that.
first,
if
the
statutory
claim
is
preempted,
if
congress
wanted
to
preempt
the
statutory
claim
because
of
its
impact
on
american's
rates,
why
would
congress
not
want
to
preempt
the
contract
claim
which
challenges
the
same
decision
for
the
same
reason,
seeks
the
same
relief,
and
would
have
the
same
impact?
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
ginsburg,
this
case
doesn't
raise
that
hard
question
about
express
promises
that
the
airline
simply
refuses
to
perform,
because
in
this
case
it
is
undisputed
that
american
expressly
reserved
the
right
to
change
frequent
flyer
rules
and
awards
at
any
time.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
preemption,
justice
souter,
for
the
following
reason.
in
our
view,
it
is
certain
that
the
plaintiffs
cannot
prevail
unless,
under
state
law
norms
and
policies,
that
express
reservation
clause
is
limited
or
invalidated,
either
on
the
ground
that
it
gave
inadequate
notice--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
ginsburg,
in
our
view
the
only
fair
way
to
read
that
reservation
of
rights
is
that
it
applies
across
the
board.
but
to
answer
your
question,
even
if
it
could
conceivably
be
interpreted
differently,
there
is
at
least
a
palpable
risk
that
state
law
norms
and
policies
will
come
into
play
in
construing
and
applying
that
express
reservation
clause,
and
when
you're
dealing
with
a
case
of
express
preemption,
we
don't
have
to
show
an
actual
conflict.
we
only
have
to
show
that
there's
a
risk
of
interference
with
federal
objectives.
here
the
risk
is--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
unfortunately
we
are
not
destined
to
win,
because
if
you'll
look
at
the
opinion
of
the
illinois
supreme
court
below,
all
it
had
before
it
was
a
preemption
question.
it
went
out
of
its
way
to
say
that
american
airlines
had
breached
a
contract.
that
was
not
a
mistake,
because
the
dissent--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
wouldn't
use
the
phrase
right-thinking
court--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--but
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
had
two
opportunities
to
decide
whether
these
claims
are
preempted.
it
ruled
on
one
ground,
and
this
court
set
that
aside
because
it
was
plainly
wrong.
it's
now
ruled
on
another
ground,
which
is
indistinguishable
from
the
ground
this
court
rejected
in
morales.
basically,
the
second
time
around,
the
illinois
supreme
court
said
the
claims
are
not
preempted
because
they
will
not
actually
prescribe
or
dictate
particular
rates,
routes,
or
services,
but
in
morales
this
court
squarely
held,
based
on
erisa
precedents,
that
section
1305
is
not
limited
to
laws
that
will
directly
prescribe
rates,
routes,
or
services.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
it
is
a
tremendous
threat
to
the
competitive
capacity,
because
if
the
case--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--because,
your
honor,
what
that
would
essentially
say
is,
unless
the
airline
uses
the
particular
magic
words
in
its
reservation
of
rights
clause
that
a
particular
state
will
give
effect
to,
that
reservation
will
have
no
effect,
and
that
will
deter
airlines
from
engaging
in
the
very
innovative
types
of
competition,
such
as
frequent
flyer
programs,
that
the
airline
deregulation
act
was
precisely
intended
to
encourage.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
that's...
to
answer
justice
o'connor's
question,
that
is
the
third
objective
of
the
airline
deregulation
act,
is
nationwide
uniformity.
precisely
because
those
kinds
of
questions
on
the
merits
could
be
decided
differently
in
different
states
is
why
you
need
to
have
dot
deciding
those
questions
on
a
national,
uniform
basis.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
your
honor,
i
believe
that...
i'm
not
certain
of
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
question
is
probably
yes,
but
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
as
i
said,
your
honor,
i'm
not
certain
of
the
answer
to
that
question,
but
even
if
that
were
so;
at
least
you
would
have
the
federal
courts
deciding
such
rules,
which
are
more
likely
to
be
decided
on
a
national,
uniform
basis.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
we
believe
these
contracts
are
enforceable.
they're
simply
enforceable
under
law.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
justice
breyer--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--justice
breyer,
these
very
claims
were
brought
before
dot
challenging
the
very
same--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--they
relate
in
two
ways,
justice
breyer.
first,
section
1381
gives
dot
the
jurisdiction
to
consider
this
precise
claim.
it
has
considered
it,
decide...
rejected
it
on
the
merits.
if
dot
had
agreed
that
what
american
had
done
in
1988
was
deceptive
or
unfair,
it
could
have
issued
a
cease
and
desist
order
so
that
the
rates
in
effect
before
the
change
would
continue
to
be
in
effect.
second,
section
1371(2),
the
congress
gave
a
specific
remedy,
authorized
dot
to
provide
a
compensation
remedy
to
passengers
for
breach
of
"agreements".
that's
a
remedy
that
dot
has
for
breach
of
agreements.
it
has
failed
to
exercise
that
remedy,
but
the
fact--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think
this
is
not
a
case
of
primary
jurisdiction,
though
the
government
takes
the
position
in
its
brief
that
nader
is
no
longer
good
law
on
that
point
after
enactment
of
the
deregulation
act,
but
essentially
speaking,
our
argument
would
be
that
because
these
claims
directly
assert
a
right
to
a
particular
rate,
route,
or
service,
they
clearly
come
within
morales.
they
would
have
the
same
impact
as
the
statutory
claims,
and
they
should
be
preempted.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice:
first,
there
is
no
textual
basis
for
the
government's
unworkable
distinction
between
normative
and
nonnormative
contract
claims,
for
two
reasons.
first,
limiting
preemption
to
state-imposed
norms
or
policies
is
very
much
like
limiting
preemption
to
state-imposed
requirements
or
prohibitions,
which
was
the
very
different
statutory
language
at
issue
in
cipollone,
but
section
1305
sweeps
much
more
broadly.
it
preempts
state
laws
that
relate
to
rates,
routes,
and
services,
not
just
state
laws
that
relate
to
rates,
routes,
and
services
and
also
impose
state
norms.
second,
as
this
court
made
clear
and
held
in
morales,
section
1305
preempts
state
laws
even
if
the
underlying
state
policy
would
be
consistent
with
the
federal
objectives.
there
is,
therefore,
no
reason
to
have
this
normative
distinction,
because
state
laws
that
relate
to
rates,
routes,
and
services
are
preempted
regardless
of
what
the
underlying
state
policy
is.
the
express
preemption
clause
is
designed
to
preempt
a
sphere
where
there's
a
risk.
here,
the
risk
is
palpable
because
the
impact
of
the
statutory
claim
and
the
contract
claim
would
be
the
same,
and
also--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--your
honor,
because
the
tort
claim
would
not
have
the
same
impact.
the
respondents
in
this
case
are
claiming
a
direct
right
to
a
particular
rate.
tort
claims
are
not
claiming
a
direct
right
to
a
particular
rate.
those
are
in
the
indirect,
tenuousness
exception
of
morales.
second,
the
remedy
that
preempted
claimants
would
have
here
is
exactly
the
same
federal
remedy
as
the
government
agrees
would
be
sufficient
for
the
normative
contract
claims
that
the
government
agrees
should
be
preempted.
third,
this
case
necessarily
depends
on
state
norms
of
unconscionability
or
inadequate
notice.
the
argument
that
the
reservation
clause
does
not
apply
is
an
argument
that
it
did
not
adequately
inform
consumers
that
it
would
have
a
so-called
retroactive
effect.
that
is
the
same
argument
they
make
under
their
statutory
deceptive
practices
claim.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
yes.
it
saves
anything
that
is
not
preempted
by
the
text
of
1305.
that's
what
this
court--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think,
your
honor,
the
court
answers
that
question
by
looking
at
the
text
of
1305
to
decide
on
that
basis
what
is
or
is
not
preempted,
and
what
is
not
preempted--
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
--i
think
a
contract
claim
for
lost
luggage
in
which
the
claimant
says
my
bag
was
worth
$500
and
the
airline
says
it
was
worth
$300
is
not
going
to
be
preempted,
because
it
doesn't
directly
assert
a
right
to
a
particular
rate,
route,
or
service,
and
its
indirect
effect
will
be
too
tenuous
or
remote.
airlines
are
not
going
to
change
their
competitive
decisions
on
that
ground.
let
me
point
out
from
page
33
of
our
opening
brief
that
the
dot
proceeding
to
which
i
referred
was
not
just
a
rulemaking
proceeding,
it
was
a
complaint
proceeding,
and
it
challenged
the
very
same
american
airlines
decision
that
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
bruce
j.
ennis,
jr.
thank
you.
