justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
deregulation
more
about
freeing
airlines
from
intrusive
government
oversight
than
it
was
concerned
about
requiring
airlines
to
keep
their
promises
and
let
them
be
enforced?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could
the
dot
promulgate
a
regulation
saying
that
claims
of
this
type
should
proceed
in
state
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
a...
if
the
airline
sells
a
passenger,
a
prospective
passenger
a
ticket
at
a
certain
rate
and
the
passenger
goes
to
the
gate
on
the
day
of
the
flight
and
is
told,
well,
we
just
upped
the
rates,
and
it
will
be
$100
more?
i
guess
under
your
theory
the
passenger
would
have
no
state
court
lawsuit
for
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--respondents
are
trying
to
hold
the
airline
to
what
they
say
was
promised,
and
it's
hard
to
understand
why
it
matters
whether
you
call
it
a
contract
action
or
a
consumer
fraud
action.
the
result
is
absolutely
the
same
with
relation
to
the
rates
and
services.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so--
--but
it's
identical
to
the
consumer
fraud
claim,
where
it
depends
on
what
it
is
the
airline
promised.
you're
saying
the
consumer
fraud
action
at
the
state
level
is
preempted
but
not
the
contract
action,
and
the
consumer
fraud
action
under
state
law
would
proceed
in
much
the
same
way
as
the
contract
action:
what
is
it
the
airline
promised,
and
it
was
fraudulent
to
promise
such-and-such
and
not
deliver
it.
i
mean,
that's...
it
seems
to
me,
it
is
the
same
in
its
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
gordon,
if
you
trade-in
frequent
flyer
mileage
credits
it's
just
another
way
of
buying
a
ticket
on
the
airline--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
it
seems
to
me
that
an
action
such
as
yours
concerning
the
frequent
flyer
program
relates
to
rates
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
just
as
morales
indicated.
i
don't
see
how
you
get
it
out
from
under
what
the
court
said
in
morales.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
it
is
possible,
of
course,
that
under
the
present
regime
a
dissatisfied
customer
could
go
to
the
dot
with
a
complaint
and
say,
look,
we
think
you,
dot,
ought
to
order
the
airlines
not
to
make
retroactive
changes,
and
i
assume
the
department
of
transportation
would
have
the
authority
to
issue
such
a
directive
to
the
airlines
if
it
chose
to
do
so.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
disagree
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
department
of
transportation
surely
has
the
authority
to
direct
the
airlines
not
to
make
retroactive
changes
in
these
programs.
