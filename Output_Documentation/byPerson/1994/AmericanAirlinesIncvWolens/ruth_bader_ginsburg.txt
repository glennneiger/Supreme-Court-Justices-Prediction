--accidents
can
have
a
very
powerful
effect
on
service,
can
they
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ennis,
can
you
tell
us
what
else
would
be
left
out?
you
said
overbooking
is
preempted.
how
about
lost
baggage?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
in
one
case
the
parties
are
the
regulators,
in
the
other
case
the
government
is.
one
thing
is
government
imposition
of
requirements
which
could
be
inconsistent
with
federal
requirements.
the
other
is,
as
the
government
puts
it,
giving
effect
to
private
ordering,
to
the
parties'
own
bargain.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
why
isn't
it
simply
a
question
of
interpreting
what
the
clause
means?
one
might
argue
that
all
that
that
clause
means
is
that
any
time
from
that
day
forward
the
airline
can
change,
but
it
can't
do
it
with
retroactive
effect.
you
characterize
that
as
invalidating
the
clause
in
advance.
it
seems
to
me
it
could
very
well
be
characterized
as
simply
construing
the
clause
that
the
parties
agreed
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
you
gave
as
one
example
an
unconscionability
doctrine
that
could
be
common
law,
but
that
that
would
not
be
written
into
the
parties'
bargain.
can
you
be
concrete
in
other
respects?
what
would
be
common
law
doctrine
that
would
be
preempted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
without
limit?
how
about
on
remedies?
how
about
injunctive
relief,
punitive
damages--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--would
you
remind
me
where
you
stand
on
injunctive
relief
in
this
very
case?
i
think
you're
no
longer
pressing
a
claim
for
injunctive
relief,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gordon,
from
what
you've
just
said,
you
seem
to
be
aligning
yourself
totally
with
the
government's
position.
it
wasn't
clear
to
me
from
your
brief
that
you
were
buying
into
the
theory
that
if
it's
state
law
being
exposed...
imposed,
and
external
restraint
on
this
agreement...
that's
the
government's
position...
then
it's
no
good.
it's
only
if
the
parties'
own
rules
are
being
enforced.
your
brief
was
not
as
clear
on
exactly
what
your
position
was
on
where
you
draw
the
line.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gordon,
what
are
we
to
do
with
mr.
ennis'
concession
that
tort
claims
aren't
preempted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ennis,
does
the
savings
clause
save
anything
in
the
realm
of
contract?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
is
the
business
that
the
state
court
can
handle
that
would
be
labeled
a
contract
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
you
give
me
an
example
of
something
that
wouldn't
be
preempted,
a
contract
claim
that
would
not
be
preempted
under
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
first
of
the
two
opinions
i
will
announce
is
in
american
airlines
against
wolens.
this
case
was
initiated
in
illinois
state
court
by
participants
in
american
airlines
frequent
flyer
program.
american
had
announced
new
restrictions
on
the
use
of
frequent
flyer
mileage
and
the
complainants
attacked
the
application
of
those
new
restrictions
retroactively.
the
frequent
flyer
participants
charged
that
by
reducing
the
value
of
their
already
accumulated
mileage,
american
had
violated
the
illinois
consumer
fraud
act
and
engaged
in
a
breach
of
contract.
the
airline
answered
that
in
the
airline
deregulation
act
of
1978,
congress
had
prohibited
the
states
from
enacting
or
enforcing
any
law
relating
to
air
carrier
rates,
routes
or
services.
that
federal
act,
american
argued
meant,
that
the
lawsuit
brought
in
illinois
had
to
be
dismissed.
the
illinois
supreme
court
rejected
american?s
argument
and
held
that
the
complaining
frequent
flyers
could
proceed
in
court
with
respect
to
their
claims
with
monetary
relief.
we
granted
the
frequent
flyers
petition
to
review
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
and
we
now
reverse
in
part
and
reaffirm
in
part.
the
federal
airline
deregulation
act
we
hold
was
state
imposed
regulation
of
air
carriers,
but
it
allows
room
for
court
enforcement
of
contract
terms
set
not
by
the
states,
but
by
the
parties
themselves.
our
reading
of
the
federal
legislation
means
that
the
frequent
flyers
may
not
sue
to
enforce
the
illinois
consumer
fraud
act,
but
they
can
proceed
in
court
on
their
breach
of
contract
claims.
our
opinion
leaves
open
for
decision
by
the
illinois
judiciary,
this
key
question
of
contract
interpretation.
did
american
airlines
by
the
agreement
it
made,
with
its
frequent
flyers,
reserve
the
right
to
impose
restrictions,
changing
the
value
of
already
accumulated
mileage
or
only
to
change
the
rules
prospectively,
covering
credits
earned
from
and
after
the
date,
that
the
new
restrictions
became
effective.
justice
stevens
joins
the
court?s
opinion
with
respect
to
the
breach
of
contract
claims,
but
dissents
with
respect
to
the
claims
asserted
under
the
illinois
consumer
fraud
act.
justice
o'connor
joined
by
justice
thomas
concurs
in
the
court?s
judgment
with
respect
to
the
claims
asserted
under
the
illinois
consumer
fraud
act,
but
dissents
from
the
court?s
disposition
of
the
breach
of
contract
claims.
justice
scalia
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
