justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
on
the
norfolk
case,
do
you
accept
the
conclusion
of
the
norfolk
case
that
common
law
doctrine
can
be
in
some
cases
displaced
under
the
airline
deregulation
act?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
standard
law,
rule,
regulation,
et
cetera
can
include
state
common
law
in
an
appropriate
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
making
this
argument,
you
don't
rely
on
the
word
"law"
under
the
statute.
in
other
words,
you
accept
the
norfolk
rule
that
decisional
mandates
are
law
in
certain
cases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
your
argument
is
not
really
tied
to
the
words
of
the
statute
in
a
very
close
way,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there's
a
civil
code
section
in
the
state
of
california,
which
there
is,
which
says
that
contracts
are
enforceable
if
there's
consideration.
it's
a
statutory
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
think
most
people
that
are
in
the
frequent
mileage
program
say,
oh,
i
now
have
an
award,
not,
i
now
have
a
free
ticket?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question,
you
hypothesized
the
exercise
of
jurisdiction
by
the
dot,
and
indicated
there
would
then
be
preemption.
would
that
preemption
be
by
operation
of
the
statute
that
we
are
here
considering?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
we
had
a
case
where
the
dot
had
issued
regulations
or
rules
on
a
certain
subject,
would
we
turn
just
to
the
statute
before
us
to
determine
whether
or
not
there's
preemption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
of
the
operation
of
the
statute,
not
because
of
some
other
doctrine
of
field
preemption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
we
do
have
to
look
at
the
words
of
the
statute
to
determine
the
relative
jurisdiction
and
jurisdictional
competence
of
the
state
and
the
agency,
and
i'm
not
sure
why
the
nonexercise
of
that
power
by
the
agency
has
anything
to
do
with
the
interpretation
of
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
they
have
the
authority
to
say
all
airline
frequent
flyer
programs
must
be
retroactive
in
order
to
protect
the
airline's
capacity
to
adjust?
