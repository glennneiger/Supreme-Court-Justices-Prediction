mr.
ennis,
is
it
your
position
that
any
subject
or
question
or
issue
that's
within
the
competence
and
the
jurisdiction
of
the
dot
is
preempted?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
dot's
jurisdiction
is
not
phrased
in
terms
of
rates,
routes,
and
services,
is
it,
or
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
i
understand,
but
you
have
been
saying
that
certain
matters
can
be
heard
by
the
dot,
and
i'm
just
asking
myself
whether
or
not
there
is
room
for
some
concurrent
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
what
you
do
with
the
norfolk
and
western
case
in
which
they
rely
on
the
fact
that
enforcement
of
a
contract
is
enforcement
of
a
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
ennis
told
us
that
you
had
entertained
a
similar
claim
and
denied
it
on
the
merits.
is
that
incorrect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
question
that
i'm
kind
of
puzzling
about?
you've
mainly
argued,
as
the
government
did,
the
contract
claim
rather
than
the
consumer
fraud
statute,
but
as
justice
o'connor
suggested
in
one
of
her
questions,
the
relief
under
either
would
be
precisely
the
same,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
have
precisely
the
same
impact
on
rates,
routes,
and
services.
i
don't
know
why
one
relates
to
rates,
routes,
and
services
more
than
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
not
abandoned
your
consumer
fraud
position,
have
you?
