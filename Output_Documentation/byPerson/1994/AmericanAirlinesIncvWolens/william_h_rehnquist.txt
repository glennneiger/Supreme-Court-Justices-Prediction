chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
93-1286,
american
airlines
v.
myron
wolens.
mr.
ennis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
a
negligence
claim
arising
out
of
a
plane
crash,
mr.
ennis?
that
certainly...
i
mean,
if
american,
for
example,
wasn't
held
liable
for
negligence
in
plane
crashes
it
certainly
would
affect
its
rates,
probably
affect
its
way
of
flying,
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
certainly
wasn't
mentioned
in...
that
test
certainly
wasn't
mentioned
in
morales,
was
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
a
potential
passenger
has
a
ticket
and
a
reservation
that
says,
that
guarantees
him...
i
know
airlines
don't
do
it,
but
supposing
we
have
an
oddball
airline
that
does,
guarantees
him
passage
on
the
4:00
p.m.
flight
from
chicago
to
washington,
and
he
gets
there,
and
he's
just
told,
well,
we've
sold
the
place
to
somebody
else.
he
gets
there
in
plenty
of
time.
so
he
simply
wants
to
sue
the
airline
for
damages.
he
was
going
to
an
important
meeting.
he
might
have
made
some
money.
is
that
preempted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
a
person
do,
go
over
and
stand
in
line
at
the
department
of
transportation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
he
do,
though?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
it
redressed
any
so
far?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
appeal
from
the
rulings
of
the
dot?
could
a
person
take
the
dot
ruling
to
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
you
run
the
same
sort
of
risk...
you
could
get
one
kind
of
ruling
from
the
fourth
circuit
on
appeal
from
dot
and
another
ruling
from
the
seventh
circuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
ennis.
ms.
pillard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
about
the
statute
of
frauds
or
the
parole
evidence
rule,
something
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
promissory
estoppel
under
section
90
of
the
restatement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
pillard.
mr.
gordon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
answer
to
justice
souter
is
that
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
that
they
don't
come
as
a
result
of
the
enforcement
of
the
bargain.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
didn't
think
that
the
fact...
i
didn't
think
your
argument
was
based
on
the
idea
that
if
you're
simply
enforcing
a
bargain
it
has
no
impact
on
the
deregulatory
scheme.
are
you
saying
that
if
enforcing
a
bargain
is
going
to
have
an
impact
on
the
deregulatory
scheme,
then
it's
gone?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gordon,
you
take
the
position
in
your
brief
that
your
consumer
fraud
act
claim
is
not
preempted,
either,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
agree
with
the
government
on
that
point,
then.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gordon.
mr.
ennis,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ennis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
