ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
agree
with
petitioner
that
the
consumer
fraud
act
claim
is
preempted,
but
we
do
disagree
on
the
proper
preemption
analysis
for
the
contract
claim.
petitioner's
suggestion
that
a
remedy
for
breach
of
contract
lies
with
the
department
of
transportation
turns
the
act
on
its
head.
the
department
has
never
been
in
the
business
of
adjudicating
private
contract
disputes,
and
the
deregulation
act--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--in
our
view,
it
is
not
empowered
to
adjudicate
private
rights.
as
this
court
referred
to
in
the
nader
decision,
the
department
of
transportation's
authority
is
to
effectuate
public
rights,
and
it
has
the
authority
to
protect
its
own
regulations
in
compliance
with
its
statute,
but
it
does
not
have
the
authority
to
adjudicate
private
contract
disputes
between
private
parties.
and
that's
consistent
with
the
deregulation
act
insofar
as
what
the
act
aimed
to
do
was
to
encourage
a
free
market
where
prices
and
production
were
determined
precisely
by
private
contract,
as
opposed
to
by
tariffs
or
government
decision,
and
in
our
view
the
private
market
depends
on
the
effectiveness
of
contract.
one
of
the
examples
that
mr.
ennis
gave
was
the
limits
on
baggage
liability.
that
limit
is
a
contract
limit,
and
the
ability
of
the
airlines
to
enforce
it
against
their
passengers
is,
in
fact,
a
matter
of
state
contract
law.
the
act's
repeated
references
to
contracts
or
agreements
between
private
parties
we
think
reflects
congress'
assumption
that
contracts
in
a
usual
sense
would
remain
effective.
the
preemption
clause,
by
its
terms,
preempts
enforcement
of
law,
not
enforcement
of
contracts.
that
was
the
position
of
the
civil
aeronautics
board,
which
it
took
contemporaneously
with
the
passage
of
the
airline
deregulation
act,
and
that's
the
position
we
take
today.
our
view
is
supported
first
by
the
text
and
structure
of
the
act,
including
the
text
of
the
preemption
clause,
references
elsewhere
in
the
active
contracts,
the
clause
saving
remedies,
and
the
actions
of
any
provision
for
an
alternative
federal
remedy
for
breach
of
contract
rights.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
the...
in
norfolk
&
western,
the
entire
function
of
the
statute
was
quite
different
from
the
airline
deregulation
act.
there,
you
had
a
situation
in
which
the
interstate
commerce
commission
was
empowered
on
a
case-by-case
basis
to
preempt
state
law
as
necessary
to
allow
carriers
to
consolidate.
it
was
almost
like
a
bankruptcy
type
of
situation,
where
congress
gave
the
icc
authority
to
shear
away
obligations,
and
in
that
act
the
commission
has
the
obligation
to
see
to
the
rights
of
employees,
so...
and
the
court
found
that
important
in
construing
the
language
of
the
statute
to
allow
preemption
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
because
clearly
that
was
contemplated
in
the
act
in
giving
the
commission
the
authority
to
provide
for
the
rights
of
employees.
here,
you
have
a
situation
where
the
department
does
not
have
a
mechanism
for
providing
for
the
rights
of
passengers
or
others
dealing
with
the
airlines.
in
fact,
the
department's
regulations
contemplate
as
an
important
contract
enforcement
mechanism
that
individuals
can
go
to
state
court,
and
that's
expressed
in
the
regulations.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i'm
not
sure
what
he's
referring
to,
unless
he's
referring
to
the
petition
for
a
proposed
rulemaking
which
was
filed
by
the
association
of
discount
travel
brokers,
and
there
the
department
decided
that
the
practices
were
not
unfair
and
deceptive
within
the
meaning
of
the
department's
statute,
but
it
expressly,
in
the
order
denying
rulemaking,
specified
that
we
thought
the
types
of
claims,
if
any,
were
contract
claims,
and
so
we
have
not
decided
the
contract
question
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
i'm
not
sure
if
there's
another
order
that
he's
referring
to.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
do
think
that
common
law
doctrine
can
be,
in
some
instances,
displaced,
but
i--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--it
can,
but
we
don't
believe
that
it
includes
contracts,
because
the
provisions
that
that
refers
to
are
provisions
with
the
force
and
effect
of
law,
such
as,
for
example,
the
tariffs,
as
opposed
to
private
parties'
agreements
which,
standing
on
their
own,
are
really
the
voluntary
undertakings
of
the
parties
and--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--are
fully
consistent
with
deregulation.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
the
result
is
only
the
same,
justice
o'connor,
if
you
look
at
the
claim
without
reference
to
the
act
of
the
carrier
which
gives
rise
to
the
contract
obligation.
however,
that's
not
the
inquiry
under
state
contract
law.
under
state
contract
law,
the
inquiry
is
very
much
whether
this
was
a
voluntary
undertaking
of
the
carrier,
and
only
if
the
carrier
in
fact
contracted
to
be
bound
is
that
obligation...
are
they
held
to
that
obligation,
and
that's
very
much
in
contrast
to
a
situation
where
the
state
proscribes,
independent
of
what
the
airline
thinks
is
best
for
it.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
i
think
this
relates
to
what
justice
breyer
was
saying
about,
there
is
a
difference
between
these
two
causes
of
action.
in
our
view,
it's
a
very
significant
difference
when
it
comes
to
whether
airlines
remain
free
to
offer
rates,
routes,
and
services
on
their
own
terms.
the
difference
is
that
in
proving
a
contract
claim
you
have
to
prove
the
agreement.
in
proving
a
consumer
fraud
act
claim,
all
you
have
to
prove
is
the
intent
to
deceive,
and
they're
two
different
inquiries,
and--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--in
certain
cases,
but
we
think
that
taken
together--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--well,
i
would
disagree,
justice
kennedy,
insofar
as
what
is
being
enforced
is
not
law
in
our
example,
it's
contract,
and
so
the
enforcement
of
contract
we
think
is
not
what
congress
contemplated
in
this
act,
and
we
think
that's
reinforced
by
the
reference
to
provisions
having
the
force
and
effect
of
law,
which
is--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--i
think
you're
right
in
pointing
out
that
our
theory
does
not
depend
on
the
difference
between
common
law
and
statutory
law.
what
it
depends
on
is
where
does
the
prescription
come
from?
where
does
the
substantive
standard
controlling
rates,
routes,
and
services
come
from?
does
it
come
from
the
airlines,
or
does
it
come
from
the
government?
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
the
standard
that
we
propose
to
elaborate
on
our
concept
is
that
doctrines
which,
on
their
face
or
as
applied,
interfere
with
the
airlines'
ability
to
set
their
own
rates,
routes,
and
services,
and
the
reason
that
we
point
to
unconscionability
or
public
policy
doctrines
is
because
those
are
doctrines
which
involve
the
court
in
admitting
there
was
a
bargain
and
then
judging
the
fairness
of
that
bargain--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--as
a
policy
matter.
for
example,
two
passengers
sitting
in
adjacent
seats,
and
a
court
could
find
that
if
one
paid
$400
for
the
ticket
and
the
other
had
a
bargain
ticket
for
$100,
that's
just
unfair,
but
we
think
that's
precisely
the
kind
of
pricing
policies
that
the
deregulation
act
protects,
and
therefore
it's
that
kind
of
opportunity
within
the
rubric
of
contract
law
to
second-guess
the
bargain--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--that
we
think
is
preempted.
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
those
kind
of
rules,
the
ordinary
rules
of
offer,
acceptance,
consideration,
interpretation,
we
think
are
not
preempted
precisely--
ms.
cornelia
t.
l.
pillard
--precisely
because
they
go
to
determining
as
an
objective
matter
what
was
it
the
parties
agreed
to
in
coming
up
with
the
meaning
of
that
agreement,
as
opposed
to
second-guessing
the
nature
of
that
agreement.
thank
you,
your
honor.
