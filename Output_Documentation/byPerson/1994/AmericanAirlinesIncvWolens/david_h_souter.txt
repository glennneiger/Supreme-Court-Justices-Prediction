justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
direct
right
is
in
fact,
i
would
have
thought,
central
to
your
claim
to
be
able
to
compete,
because
you
cannot
compete
effectively
unless
the
offers
that
you
make
are
offers
that
your
customers
or
prospective
customers
can
depend
on,
so
that
if
the
customer
cannot
enforce
the
contract
which
he
thinks
he
makes
with
you,
which
is
the
essence
of
your
competitive
activity,
then
that
is,
in
fact,
a
direct
threat
to
the
very
competition
which
the
act
is
supposed
to
foster.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
can
only
be
enforced
in
the
administrative
federal
forum,
you
said.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
is
dot
enforcing
contracts
of
that
sort?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
does
it...
and
given
the
fact
that
the
enforcement
of
those
contracts
is,
i
would
suppose,
central
to
your
capacity
to
compete,
why,
nonetheless,
is
that,
and
even
the
existence
of
the
federal
forum,
an
argument
for
preemption?
it
seems
to
me
that
the
feds
may
indeed
want
to
enforce
them
if
there
were
an
insufficient
state
mechanism
to
do
it,
but
why
does
preemption
follow
from
a
threat
to
your
competitive
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
but
the
reasoning
there,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
there
is
room
under
that
statute
for
something
more
than
a
straightforward
enforcement
of
the
bargain.
there
is
room
for
policy
choices
in
the
state
forum,
whereas
under
a
straight
contract
claim
there
is
not.
is
that
roughly
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
simply
means
that,
if
you're
correct,
you
may
win
the
case
if
it
is
litigated
in
state
court,
but
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
preemption.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
aren't
you
in
effect
simply
saying
that
the
risk
of
interference
comes
from
the
fact
that,
in
construing
the
parties'
bargain,
the
state
court
might
get
it
wrong
in
your
viewpoint.
it's
kind
of
the
mirror
image
of
your
argument
that
there
should
be
no
preemption
because
you
are
destined
to
win.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
say
i
think
your
argument
is
that
you
are
destined
to
win
before
any
right-thinking
court.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
maybe,
indeed
in
your
view,
and
perhaps
in
the
ultimate
view,
the
court
went
off
on
a
tangent
of
reasoning,
but
i
don't
see
why
it
follows
from
that
that
if
a
court
applies
basically
straight,
common
law
principles
of
contract
interpretation
to
enforce
a
bargain
which
the
parties
themselves
made,
or
for
the
purpose
of
enforcing
and
doing
nothing
more
than
enforcing
a
bargain
which
the
parties
themselves
have
made,
that
that
is
somehow
a
threat
in
effect
to
the
competitive
capacity,
which
it
was
one
of
the
objects
of
the
airlines
deregulation
act
to
foster.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
it
any
more
a
threat
to
competitive
capacity
than
it
is
when
a
federal
forum
is
used?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it
is
in
fact
the
lack
of
absolutely
uniform
state
law
in
every
state
forum,
then,
which
is
the
essence
of
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
you
agree
that
punitive
damages
would
be
subject
to
preemption?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
neither
are
they
the
enforcement
of
the
bargain,
and
i
thought
the
essence
of
your
bargain
is
that
what
you're
asking
for
is
the
enforcement
of
a
bargain,
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
act
was
supposed
to
foster,
but
if
you
go
to
punitive
damages
you've
passed
that
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
realize,
but
doesn't
your
argument
really
force
you
for
consistency's
sake
to
say
punitive
damages
would,
in
fact,
be
preempted?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
doesn't
that
pick
up
the
tort
claim,
too?
