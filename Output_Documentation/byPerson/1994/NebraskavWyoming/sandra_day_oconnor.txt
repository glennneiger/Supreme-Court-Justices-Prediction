justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
know,
i'm
a
little
confused
because
i
thought
that
in
wyoming's
requested
amended
counterclaim
and
first
cross-claim
that
wyoming
was
seeking
to
alter
the
75
percent-25
percent
apportionment
approach.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
not
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
master
seem
to
think
that
that
is
what
the
first
amended
counterclaim
and
cross-claim
was
seeking
to
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
wyoming
does
want
to
seek
an
amendment,
and
wants
to
change
the
75-25
percent
apportionment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
well
then--
--well,
what
would
the
amendment
be?
i
mean...
i'm
sorry.
that's
my
question.
if
you
answer
no,
what
kind
of
an
amendment
do
you
want?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
by
virtue
of
imposing
some
quantitative
limitation?
is
that
what
you're
seeking,
a
quantitative
limitation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then
that
is
different
than
the
approach
taken
under
the
decree
of
the
percentage
appointment,
so
the
master
may
be
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
interested
in
wyoming's
fourth
cross-claim
which
the
master
had
recommended
allowing
to
be
made,
but
the
united
states
and
nebraska
oppose
that,
and
would
you
mind
addressing
that
a
little
bit?
the
fourth
cross-claim
includes
an
allegation
that
the
united
states
has
not
operated
its
upstream
reservoirs
in
accordance
with
various
private
contracts
that
exist
for
their
operation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
should
that
claim
be
included
in
this
dispute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
wyoming
a
party
to
any
of
those
contracts?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
at
this
point,
the
master
thought
there
was
no
evidence
of...
that
wyoming
was
getting
less
of
the
natural
flows
than
it
otherwise
would,
so
the
master
didn't
see...
doesn't
demonstrate,
at
least,
any
need
for
the
fourth
cross-claim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
know
he
thought
it
should
be
allowed,
but
he
also
noted
that
at
this
juncture
there's
no
evidence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
do
you
see
this
line
that
the
master
proposes?
he
wouldn't
allow
nebraska
to
just
claim
outright
some
right
to
protect
the
wildlife
uses,
and
yet
he
indicates
that
some
of
that
evidence
can
come
in
under
the
proposed
amendments,
and
just
how
do
you
see
that
working?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
quite
vague,
and
i
still
don't
understand
what
would
come
in,
as
opposed
to
what
would
be
admitted
if
your
state
were
allowed
to
amend
the
complaint,
as
it
proposed.
