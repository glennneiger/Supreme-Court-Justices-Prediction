mr.
cook,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
circumvention
claim
is
not
entirely
out
of
the
case
as
the
special
master
sees
it?
didn't
he
say,
although
he
was
disallowing
the
counterclaim,
that
you
could
make
defensive
use
of
that
matter?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
it
your
view
that
the
parties
to
those
contracts
would
have
a
right
to
intervene
in
this
proceeding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
also
envision
any
potential
conflict
in
the
adjudication
in
this
original
action
and
in
the
district
court
if
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
the
counterclaim
is
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
cross-claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wouldn't
the
interest
of
others
who
are
not
in
this
proceeding
now
be
implicated
if
that
cross-claim
is
adjudicated?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
mean
the
parties
to
the
agreements.
