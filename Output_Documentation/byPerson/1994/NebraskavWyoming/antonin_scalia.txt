how
is
that
any
different
from
expanding
the
geographic
scope
of
the
case?
is
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--anything
other
than
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
see--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
normally
when
you
define
the
scope
of
a
case
you
try
to
define
it
in
such
a
way
that
all
of
the
injuries
that
seem
to
you
significant
for
that
case
will
be
within
the
geographic
reach
that
you've
decided
to
examine.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
to
say,
well,
we've
decided
to
examine
only
this
geographic
reach,
but
of
course,
if
there
are
injuries
beyond
that
we
must
take
them
into
account,
at
least
defensively,
is
simply
to
say,
we
didn't
draw
our
geographic
scope
broadly
enough
to
begin
with,
and
therefore
we
have
to
expand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
thought
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
how
does
that
differ
from
the
count
iv,
exception
iv
that
was
denied?
why
doesn't
the
same
argument
apply
to
that?
you
have
to
look
at
the
whole
picture.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
point
made
is
that
the
decree
was
drawn
with
a
view
to
what
would
happen
to
the
storage
water
and
the
nonflow
water,
that
the
decree
assumed
certain
dispositions,
and
to
distort
those
dispositions
is
necessarily,
therefore,
to
distort
the
decree.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
some
of
those
parties
who
draw
on
that
water
are
wyoming
parties
and
some
are
nebraska
parties,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
nebraska
parties
who
normally
would
draw
upon
that
flow
have
found
that
they
can
get
water
elsewhere,
and
perhaps
even
cheaper,
and
therefore
don't
care
if
the
corps
of
engineers
is
running
this
thing
wrong,
and
if
they
are
not
getting
their
contractual
rights,
they
don't
care
about
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
for
everyone
else,
but
not
for
nebraska.
but
not
for
nebraska,
because
other
usable
water
in
nebraska
is
being
used
by
this
nebraska
contracting
party,
so
the
state
of
nebraska
is
hurt
even
though
the
party
to
the
allocation
of
the
stored
water
contract
is
not
hurt.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
saying
one
of
the
parties
to
this
contract
can
be
getting
water
elsewhere,
and
therefore
not
give
a
darn
about
whether
the
contract
is
being
implemented
properly.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
hurt
nebraska,
even
though
it
doesn't
hurt
the
contracting
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
as
well?
can
the
state
get
into
that
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
they?
