justice
david
h.
souter
do
i
understand
you
correctly
that
one
possible
amendment
that
might
satisfy
you
would
be
an
amendment
so
the
decree
would
read
something
like
this:
nebraska
is
entitled
to
x
percent
up
to
so
many
acre
feet,
so
that
there
would
be
an
acre
feet
limitation
which
in
fact
would
be,
i
suppose,
a
limitation
on
the
percentage.
that
would
then
give
wyoming
the
advantage
that
if
there
were
excess
usable
water,
that
wyoming
in
effect
would
be
able
to
either
keep
it
or
more
easily
claim
it,
so
long
as
nebraska
got
its
so
many
acre
feet.
is
that
what
it
would
boil
down
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that,
as
justice
o'connor
says,
whether
it
should
be
entertained
or
not,
that
would
be
a
reconceptualization
of
the
decree.
justice
david
h.
souter
could
you
just
give
me
a
quick
summary
of
that?
who
gets
hurt
in
wyoming
by
what
the
national
government
is
doing?
justice
david
h.
souter
they're
at
the
end
of
the
line--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
if
the
water's
gone
they
get
left.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
do
you
say
it
would
let
in
all
the
evidence?
i
suppose
it
would
let
in
evidence
of
effect
on
wildlife,
and
so
on.
does
it
let
in
every
bit
of
evidence
on
irrigation
claims
which
do
not
yet...
or
which
do
not
exist
with
respect
to
the
off
season?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
might
do
that,
but
you
said
it
would
let
in
all
the
evidence
that
was...
that
would
have
been
kept
out
under
the
earlier
part
of
the
decree
saying
we
don't
get
into
the
nonirrigation
season.
why
does
it
let
in
all
of
the
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
many,
but
not
all,
i
suppose.
justice
david
h.
souter
can
you
tell
me
how
specifically
you
address
mr.
cook's
answer
to
my
question,
and
that
is
that
wyoming
simply
cannot...
if
i
understand
it
wyoming
simply
cannot
litigate
its
claim
insofar
as
it
relates
to
wyoming
users
with
the
least
priority
without,
in
effect,
taking
up
this
very
issue
of
the
propriety
of
the
federal
storage
water
practice.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then
you
are...
are
you
saying
that
in
fact
the
extent
of
availability
of
water
for
storage,
and
hence
its
effect
on
the
wyoming
users
with
the
least
priority,
can
be
determined
in
this
action
without
bringing
in
the
issue
of
the
practices
of
the
united
states
in
storing
and
releasing
its
storage
water?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
contracting
parties
may
not
have
a...
may
not
be
hurt
in
any
way
here.
the
claim
here
is
that
a
third
party
is
being
hurt
by
the
way
the
contracts
are
being
administered,
and
it
may
be
that
the
contracting
parties
have
nothing
to
complain
about
and
hence
will
never
litigate.
justice
david
h.
souter
nonthird
party
beneficiaries,
but
independent
individuals
whose
interests
in
effect
are
being
foreclosed
by
a
maladaministration
of
the
contract.
