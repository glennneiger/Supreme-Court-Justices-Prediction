mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
colorado
today
joins
in
exception
2,
filed
by
wyoming,
which
seeks
to
limit
the
scope
of
these
proceedings
to
ripe
claims
that
address
the
issues
of
new
development
and
supply
that
the
court
considered
in
its
1993
opinion.
exception
2
seeks
to
exclude
from
the
consideration
in
this
case
issues
relating
to
nonirrigation
season
flows
and
wildlife
issues
that
are
not
a
part
of
the
case.
colorado
really
has
two
points
to
make.
one
is
that
the
court
has
already
ruled
previously
that
such
matters
should
not
be
included
in
this
case,
and
secondly,
even
if
the
court
were
to
think
that
they
may
play
some
role
in
the
case,
they're
not
ripe
for
adjudication
in
this
proceeding.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
exception
2,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
of
wyoming.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
twice
before,
this
court
has
been
asked
by
nebraska
to
expand
the
scope
of
proceedings
to
include
nonirrigation
season
flows.
first,
in
1988
nebraska
asked
for
a
general
global
apportionment
of
the
water
resource
to
include
downstream
flows
far
beyond
the
scope
of
the
1945
decree.
in
1988,
the
court
denied
that
request.
again,
in
1992,
nebraska
once
again
sought
to
expand
the
scope
of
the
proceeding
to
include
those
claims.
again,
in
the
1993
ruling,
the
court
again
agreed
that
those
issues
should
not
be
a
part
of
the
case.
the
special
master,
the
united
states,
colorado
and
wyoming,
all
who
have
looked
at
those
issues,
have
concluded
that
those
issues
are
not
ripe
for
adjudication
in
these
proceedings,
and
we
would
like
the
court
today
in
this
ruling
to
affirm
that
those
issues
should
not
be
heard
as
we
go
to
trial
in
the
case.
the
reasons
for
that
are
simply,
first
of
all
the
special
master
has
clearly
articulated
twice
in
both
the
second
and
third
interim
reports
that
those
issues
are
not
ripe.
the
united
states
agreed
with
that
in
their
presentation
last
summer
in
considering...
in
consideration
of
the
amended
proceedings.
there
have
been
no
changed
circumstances
from
the
court's
earlier
rulings
till
today
that
would
merit
the
expansion
of
these
proceedings.
furthermore,
many
of
these
issues
are
being
resolved
or
addressed
in
other
forums,
and
would
not
be
appropriate
for
consideration
in
this
original
proceeding.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
that's
correct.
we
think
the
special
master
closed
the
front
door
on
the
claim,
apparently,
by
denying
the
count
iv
expansion.
through
the
back
door
he's
let
in
all
the
evidence
and
all
the
consideration
of
that
claim
in
the
proceedings
anyway,
so
what
he's
taken
away
on
the
one
hand
he's
given
back
to
the
parties
on
the
other.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
those
uses
were
not
evaluated
under
the
1945
decree,
and
what
the
court's
1993
opinion,
what
the
proceedings
to
date
indicate
is,
how
do
you
analyze
the
supply
issues,
the
new
development
upstream
in
wyoming
and
what
their
impact
is
on
the
pivotal
reach
of
the
north
platte
river?
those
are
the
issues
in
the
case,
and
the
court
has
never
opened
the
door
for
consideration
of
downstream
new
uses,
new
demands,
as
it
affects
this
case,
so
that
would
be
a
remarkable
expansion
of
the
proceedings.
to
permit
that
aspect
of
the
case.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
there's
been
a
suggestion
by
the
united
states
in
their
briefs
that
a
limited
inquiry
would
be
not
improper
in
this
case,
and
the
special
master
in
his
report
says
limited
inquiry
would
be
appropriate.
we
think,
however,
that
an
evaluation
of
the
effect
on
wildlife
usage
and
nonirrigation
season
flows
would
open
this
proceeding
to
a
very
expanded
and
complex
evaluation
of
the--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--because
if
the
court
goes...
permits
the
case
to
proceed
with
an
evaluation
of
effects
several
hundred
miles
to
the
east
of
the
pivotal
reach,
then
you're
also
going
to
have
to
evaluate
the
effect
of
nebraska's
conservation
and
waste
practices
and
many
other
issues
that
were
specifically
excluded
previously
in
the
case,
so
in
that
way
you
get
to
many
issues
that
were...
where
the
court--
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
--i
think
it
really
is
the
question
of
ripeness
and
the
scope
of
the
proceedings,
because
it
would
be
a
very
expanded
proceeding.
i
think
everybody
would
concede
that
this
case
would
be
far
different
than
it
is
if
the
court
were
to
grant
that
exception
and
limit
the
scope
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
i
think
there
is
a
matter
of
relationships,
but
that's
not
this
case,
and
the
special
master
himself,
in
the
third
interim
report
and
in
the
oral
argument
last
summer,
indicated
that
those
claims
were
not
ripe
for
these
proceedings.
that's
not
to
say
that
they
won't
be
in
the
future.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
i
don't
think
there's
a
functional
distinction
between
permitting
the
trial
of
those
issues
in
this
proceeding
as
opposed
to
granting
or
denying
count
iv
of
the
claim,
which
specifically
addresses
it.
there
will
be
no
difference
in
the
trial
in
that
event,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
again,
that
goes
to
the
scope
of
the
proceedings
and
whether
these
claims
are
now
ripe
for
consideration,
even
regardless
of
their
relevancy
to
the
proceeding,
because
the
special
master
has
acknowledged
that
those
issues
cannot
bear
on
the
injury
in
this
case.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
i
think
your
honor
is
suggesting
that
it's
the
equivalent
of
a
motion
in
limine,
and
it
really
goes
far
beyond
that,
because
really
it
makes
the
difference
of
whether
or
no
colorado
is
in
this
case
at
trial
and
whether
the
special
master
is
then
going
to
look
at
the
entire
basin-wide
effects
of
wildlife
and
endangered
species
issues.
for
example,
downstream
in
the
big
bend
reach
here,
it
is
also
part
of
the
south
platte
basin,
so
there
are
far...
there
are
issues
that
range
far
beyond
the
mere
enforcement,
interpretation,
and
modification
of
the
north
platte
decree.
i
am
not
saying
that
those
issues
are
not
relevant
to
a
proceeding.
they
are
not
ripe
for
this
proceeding,
and
it
would
be
improper
for
the
court,
based
on
its
prior
rulings
and
the
existing
scope
of
the
proceedings,
to
open
the
door
for
that
type
of
claim.
it
would
really
be
an
about-face
on
the
court's
previous
limitations
on
geography
and
time.
it
would
expand
the
geographical
scope
of
the
case
and
expand
the
temporal
scope
of
the
case
in
a
way
the
court
has
never
done
before.
colorado's
second
argument
is
that
as
a
prudential
matter
these
issues
are
not
justiciable
or
not
ripe
at
this
time.
even
nebraska
concedes
that,
because
they've
not
filed
an
exception
to
the
special
master's
failure
to
grant
their
court
iv,
and
i
think
the
reason
that
nebraska
has
done
that
is
that
they
feel
they
can
try
these
issues
in
the
back-door
manner
in
which
the
special
master
has
permitted
the
evidence.
more
importantly,
these
issues
should
and
must
be
resolved
critically
in
another
agency
and
another
forum.
the
endangered
species
and
wildlife
issues
are
currently
a
part
of
at
least
three
proceedings,
one
involving
endangered
species
act
interpretations
on
the
deer
creek
and
the
grayrocks
reservoirs,
the
issues
are
also
in
the
ferc
proceedings
involving
lake
mcconaughy,
and
the
three
states
have
involved
in
a
mutual
cooperative
approach
through
their
governor's
office
to
try
to
accommodate
and
resolve
the
wildlife
issues.
so
importantly,
i
think
this
case
ought
to
defer
to
those
agencies
and
defer
to
that
process
to
let
it
take
its
course,
rather
than
fix
in
stone
or
enshrine
in
a
decree
of
this
court
the
wildlife
and
endangered
species
needs
involving
the
north
platte.
mr.
timothy
m.
tymkovich
it
is,
however,
up
to
this
court
to
define
clearly
the
scope
of
the
proceedings,
and
the
case
with
this
type
of
evidence,
with
this
claim,
will
be
far
broader
and
more
complex
than
the
case
without
it,
which
i
think
is
what
the
court
was
doing
when
it
ruled
in
1993
in
denying
those
previous
claims
and
excluding
the
scope
of
the
proceedings
to
those
issues.
thank
you.
