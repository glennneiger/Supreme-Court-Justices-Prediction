justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
still
slightly
mixed
up.
as
i
read
the
amendment,
your
first
counterclaim
seems
to
mix
up
two
things.
what
you
seem
to
ask
for
is,
we'd
like
a
certain
quantitative
limitation,
i.e.,
nebraska
gets
no
more
than
what
they
need
for
beneficial
use--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--not
a
percentage
limitation.
but
then
it
says,
the
reason
that
we
want
that
is
because
to
do
the
contrary
would
be
in
excess
of
the
volumetric
limitations
or
diversion
limitations
that
are
fixed
in
paragraph
iv
of
the
decree,
so
that
sounds
as
if
what
you're
saying,
the
decree
requires
that.
and
that
i
think
is
what
might
have
explained
the
master
saying,
look,
you
brought
this
action
to
enforce
the
decree,
not
to
modify
the
decree.
if
you
want
to
go
bring
a
different
action
and
say
some
other
rule
requires
us,
not
the
decree,
but
we
want
a
new
decree
or
something,
and
we
want
to
now
decide
they're
only
going
to
get
so
many
acre
feet,
or
whatever
it
is,
then
go
do
that,
but
this
is
quite
mixed
up
and
contrary
to
the
way
you
started
out,
and
contrary
to
what
the
court
said,
where
it
said
the
decree,
this
court
said
is
a
percentage
allocation,
not
an
absolute
allocation.
am
i
right
in
thinking
that's
how
the
master's
thinking?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
what's
wrong
with
that
thinking?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
this
would
get
at
the...
why
didn't
you
make
your
first
amended
complaint
the
following:
conceding
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
the
decree
has
nothing
to
do
with
any
absolute
limitation
in
volume,
we
now
make
a
new
complaint,
and
this
is
our
complaint.
our
complaint
is,
we
want
you
to
limit
the
amount
of
money
they
can
take...
the
amount
of
water
they
can
take
to
an
absolute
limit
of
x
million,
or
beneficial
use.
why
didn't
you
write
it
that
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
could
we
say
in
advance
that
the
master's
wrong
in
saying
that
the
wildlife
might
relevant,
it
might
turn
out
to
be
relevant?
i
mean,
apparently
the
size
of
the
stream
has
gone
down
from
about
70
percent
or
something
to
under
10,
20
percent
of
what
it
was,
that
there
are
wildlife
endangered
if
you
don't...
you
have
to
have
some
water
in
there,
and
whatever
water
they'd
have
in
the
winter
may
mean
there's
less
in
the
summer.
i
mean,
it's
not
difficult
to
think
of
relationships.
how
can
we
say
that
he's
wrong
in
saying
if
it
turns
out
to
be
relevant,
i'll
let
it
in?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
might
not
understand
it.
i
thought
he
was
saying,
we're
not
going
to
have
a
special
complaint
based
on
wildlife,
but
if
it
turns
out
that
this
evidence
of
wildlife
harm
is
relevant
to
what
we're
doing,
i'm
going
to
let
it
in.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
what
i
was
thinking,
it's
just
like
a
trial
judge
normally.
very
often
somebody
says,
let's...
he's
says,
i
don't
know.
i'll
wait
and
see.
if
it
turns
out
to
be
relevant,
i'll
let
it
in.
otherwise,
i
won't.
and
it
seemed
to
me
roughly
that's
what
the
master
was
doing
here.
if
this
looks
as
if
it
might
be
relevant,
then
i'll
let
it
in
later,
sure,
fine.
if
it
turns
out
not
to
be,
object
at
that
time.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
there
was
quite
a
difference,
but
don't
say
i'm
right
if
i'm
not
right.
i
thought
that
the
fourth
count
asked
directly
to
apportion
nonirrigation
season
flows,
that
that
was
the
subject.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
confusing--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
talking
about
the
cross-claim.
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i
understood
it,
nebraska
says
to
wyoming,
hey,
you're
not
giving
us
enough
water.
we're
getting
75
percent
all
right,
but
it's
75
percent
of
nothing.
there's
no
water
in
the
river.
and
then
wyoming
says,
yes,
yes,
but
there
would
be
75
percent...
there
would
be
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
water
in
the
river
if
only
the
united
states
was
doing
what
it
promised
to
do
in
the
contract
in
which
we
premised
this
whole
decree
upon,
and
if
that's
the
case,
or
something
roughly
like
it
is
the
case...
i'm
exaggerating
it...
i
don't
understand
why
wyoming
couldn't
defend
against
nebraska
by
saying,
look,
it's
not
our
fault,
it's
the
united
states'
fault,
and
they
should
live
up
to
their
contract
and
then
there
wouldn't
be
a
problem,
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
decree
that
says
they
can't
say
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
alloc...
that's
right--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's...
no,
that
isn't
saying
you
can't
make
the
united
states
live
up
to
its
promises
in
the
contract,
where
their
failure
to
do
so
wrecks
the
whole
premise
of
the
decree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
it
says
is
that
storage
water
shall
not
be
affected
by
this
decree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i
read
that,
that
means
that
they
don't
intend
for
this
decree
to
govern
storage
water.
that's...
i
mean,
we're
allocating
the
river.
we're
not
allocating
storage
water.
