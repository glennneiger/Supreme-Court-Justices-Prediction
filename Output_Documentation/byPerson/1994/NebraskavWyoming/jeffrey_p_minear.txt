mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
excepts
to
the
special
master's
allowance
of
wyoming's
fourth
cross-claim,
which
alleges
that
the
united
states
has
failed
to
operate
federal
reservoirs
in
accordance
with
the
reclamation
laws
and
storage
water
contracts.
we
believe
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
address
that
claim
in
this
original
action
for
three
related
reasons
going
to
the
law,
the
parties,
and
the
availability
of
another
forum.
first,
this
court's
1945
decree
does
not
govern
wyoming's
claim.
paragraph
vi
and
xii(b)
of
the
north
platte
decree
explicitly
state
that
the
decree
shall
not
affect
storage
water
or
in
any
way
interfere
with
the
federal
government's
operation
of
water
storage
facilities.
the
court
included
those
paragraphs
in
recognition
that
the
federal
reclamation
projects
predated
the
1945
apportionment,
that
private
parties
had
contracted
for
storage
water
from
those
projects,
and
their
rights
in
the
operation
of
the
projects
were
fixed
by
those
contracts.
simply
put,
the
decree
at
issue
in
this
proceeding
does
not
address
the
distributior
of
storage
water
because
the
contracts
between
the
bureau
and
the
individual
water
users
govern
who
receives
that
water.
this
court
was
mindful
of
the
bureau's
need
to
store
water
in
priority
with
other
users
to
satisfy
its
storage
water
contracts
in
1945,
but
the
court
made
absolutely
clear
that
the
decree
would
not
affect
the
delivery
of
storage
water.
instead,
any
disputes
would
continue
to
be
governed
by
the
legal
mechanisms
that
were
already
in
place
and
available
to
the
contracting
parties.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
the
problem
here
is
that
wyoming
is
seeking
affirmative
relief
affecting
the
allocation
of
storage
water,
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
north
platte
decree
currently
states.
the
decree
does
not
govern.
instead,
wyoming
has
to
rely
on
the
individual
contracts
between
the
bureau
and
the
water
users,
and
those
are
matters
that
we
believe
are
better
left
to
a
different
forum.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
wyoming,
it's
a
bit
like
hitting
a
moving
target
here,
because
wyoming
has
moved
back
and
forth
in
terms
of
exactly
what
its
pleading
amounts
to,
but
i
think
the
best
source
of
this
is
wyoming's
pleading
itself,
and
it
is
framed
completely
in
terms
of
the
allocation
of
storage
water.
paragraph
31
at
e-11
says
the
united
states
has
failed
to
operate
the
federal
reservoirs
in
accordance
with
applicable
federal
and
state
laws,
and
has
failed
to
abide
by
the
contracts
governing
the
use
of
storage
water.
specifically,
the
united
states
has
allocated
storage
water
in
a
manner,
et
cetera.
it
then
goes
on
to
make
various
specific
claims.
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
they're
challenging
how
we
can
allocate
storage
water,
and
the
storage
water,
you
must
remember,
is
defined
in
the
decree,
and
it
is
only
water
in
addition
to
what
is
natural
flow.
when
the
bureau
provides
water
to
the
individual
water
users,
it
makes
releases
from
the
reservoirs,
and
in
accounting
for
that
water,
it
always
ensures
that
the
natural
flow
portion
of
the
river
is
passed
through
the
reservoir,
and
the
storage
water
is
only
allocated
thereafter,
and
this
is
all
primarily
an
accounting
procedure
that
only
takes
place
after
the
water
has
been
released.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
is
just
incorrect.
again,
remember
that
the
natural
flow
requirements
are
satisfied
first
when
we
do
the
water
accounting,
and
the
only
question
then
is
who
gets
the
storage
water.
now,
the
dispute
here
is
not
really
between
wyoming
and
the
united
states,
and
this
brings
me
to
my
second
point.
it
really
is
between
two
different
classes
of
irrigators,
the
north
platte
irrigators
and
the
warren
act
contractors,
and
they're
mentioned
specifically
in
the
amended
pleading
here
in
the
fourth
cross-claim.
the
problem
that
we
have
here
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
your
honor.
we're
saying
that
the
river
operates
under
two
separate
regimes.
there's
the
natural
flow,
which
is
taken
care
of
by
the
decree.
in
addition,
we
have
storage
water
that
supplements
the
available
sources
for
the
various
irrigators.
the
storage
water
is
governed
by
the
contracts
between
the
bureau
and
the
individual
water
users.
they
have
those...
we
are
simply
a
deliverer
of
water
for
those
parties.
they
have--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
decree...
and
the
court
in
1945
knew
these
contracts
were
in
place.
they
knew
that
there
was
a
mechanism
with
which
to
enforce
those
contracts,
and
they
assumed
if
any
disputes
arose
over
the
enforcement
of
the
contracts,
or
the
allocation
of
those
waters,
those
waters
would
be
allocated...
would
be
dealt
with
separately.
that's--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
if
the
contracting
parties
have
nothing
to
complain
about,
it's
very
difficult
to
see
how
wyoming
could
be
a
third
party
beneficiary
of
the
contracts
in
some
respects.
in
fact,
we
think
the
problem
is
exactly
the
opposite,
namely
that
the--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--but
the
problem
here,
your
honor,
is
that
the
contract
water
itself
is
already
allocated
in
a
sense.
it
has
been
distributed
by
virtue
of
the
compact,
or
by
the
contracts
that
have
been
entered
into,
and
the
natural
flow
is
dealt
with
completely
separately
in
the
decree,
and
we
just
do
not
agree
that
there
is
any
linkage
between
the
effect
of
our
allocation
of
storage
water
on
the
decree
itself.
now--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
it
comes
from
the
nonirrigation
season
natural
flow.
the
water
begins...
according
to
the
decree,
the
irrigation
season
ends
in
october,
and
beginning
in
october,
the
united
states
has
the
senior
water
rights
for
storage.
it
takes
all
of
the
water,
all
of
the
inflows
and
puts
it
into
storage
during
the
nonirrigation
season.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it's
not
needed
elsewhere,
that's
right.
beginning
in
may,
at
that
point
the
irrigation
season
begins,
and
any
person
that
wants
water
can
call
for
water
upstream
and
the
bureau
releases
water
to
those
parties
as
they
need
it.
if
they
do
not
need
it,
the
water
will
continue
to
go
into
storage,
rather
than
to
allow
it
to
simply
go
down
to
nebraska
and
be
wasted,
and
then,
if
there
is
insufficient
water
during
the
year,
that
storage
water
is
used
to
make
up
whatever
natural
flow...
whatever
is
needed
in
addition
to
natural
flow.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
and
there
are--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--then
there
is
more
water
for
everyone
else,
because
they
draw--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i'm
afraid
i'm
not
following
your
question
here
with
respect
to
how
the
water
is
allocated.
maybe
i--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
it
might
not
hurt...
well,
i
think
what
happens
in
that
situation,
the
contractors
pay
what
amounts
to
a
fixed
cost
for
their
irrigation
water
whether
they
use
it
or
not.
if
they
do
not
use
it,
then
that
water
is
available
for
both
nebraska
and
wyoming
parties
to
draw
upon.
that
is
simply
the
way
the
water
is
being
administered.
the
problem
we
have
here,
i
think,
is
that
wyoming
is
not
the
appropriate
party
to
seek
enforcement
of
the
legal
or
contractual
rights.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
wyoming
is
suing
the
united
states
with
respect
to
the
allocation
of
storage
water.
the
one
thing
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it
says
does
not
govern...
shall
not
affect
the
storage--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--and
in--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
and
the
storage
water
instead
is
governed
by
the
contracts.
if
wyoming
seeks...
has
some
complaint
about
how
we
are
operating
the
river,
operating
the
reservoirs,
they
can
bring
an
apa
action
against
the
bureau.
and
this
brings
me
to
my
third
point,
and
that
is
that
there
is
another
alternative
dispute
mechanism
or
forum
available
for
all
the
parties
that
makes
far
more
sense--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--a
district
court
action
would
be
available.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
raised
a
sovereign
immunity
defense
in
that
case.
we
have
withdrawn
that
upon
further
consideration,
so
there
is
no--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--what?
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
on
consideration
of
the
issue...
on
consideration
of
the
issue
itself.
in
this
case,
our
objection.
first
of
all,
let
me
make
it
clear,
the
united
states
has
never
argued
that
these
issues
cannot
be
litigated
in
district
court.
our
objection
in
the
goshen
litigation
was
that
the
united
states
was
sued
under
a
provision
of
reclamation
law
that
allows
joinder
of
the
united
states.
our
objection
was,
you
need
to
have
all
the
necessary
parties
there
in
order
to
resolve
this
dispute.
subsequently,
eight
of
the
irrigation
districts,
eight
of
the
thirteen
irrigation
districts
joined
into
this
suit.
now,
looking
at
this
with
all
the
parties
there,
our
objection
is
rather
technical
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
united
states
was
sued
first,
not...
rather
than
sued
later,
so
that
is
the
reason
why
we
have
withdrawn
that
objection.
but
overall,
i
think
the
important
thing
to
recognize
in
this
suit
is
that
it
does
provide
a
forum
for
all
of
the
necessary
parties
to
litigate
the
issue.
the
contractors
themselves
have
a
very
strong
interest
in
the
protection
of
their
contracts.
they
currently
are
not
parties
to
this
suit.
this
suit
has
been
involved...
this
original
action
has
been
going
on
for
8
years,
and
is
rather
complex,
and
there
are
certainly
going
to
be
claims,
if
you
allow
the
fourth
cross-claim
to
go
forward,
for
those
parties
to
intervene
in
this
action.
you
will
have
to
deal
with
that
issue
as
well.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the
state
did
not
get
into
the
goshen
district
court
litigation.
they
were
not
involved
in
the
district
court.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
could
they?
yes,
they
could
join.
i
think
that
they...
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
they
could
certainly
file
an
amicus
brief.
i'm
not
sure
that
they
have
the
interest
sufficient
to
indicate
that
they
would
qualify
under
rule
24
for
purposes
of
intervention,
and
that's
the
same
problem
that
we
believe
that
they
have
here.
they
simply
are
not
a
party
to
the
contract,
and
i
think
their
allegations
with
respect
to
their
interest
in
these
contracts
are
very,
very
vague.
the
problem
we
have
here
is
that
there
is
a
forum
that
is
available
for
the
parties
that
are
most
interested
in
the
enforcement
of
the
contracts
to
litigate
the
claims
with
respect
to
how
that
allocation
of
storage
water
ought
to
be
performed.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
we
think
it
might
be
difficult
for
them
under
this
court's
precedents.
this
court's
decisions,
they
do
discourage
intervention
by
private
parties
in
ongoing
original
actions,
but
our
concern
is
more
of
a
practical
one,
and
that
is
the
fact
that
sooner
or
later
this
case
should
go
to
trial,
and
we
should
have
the
parties
that...
we
should
have
the
necessary
parties.
if
we're
going
to
add
this
fourth
cross-claim
in
this
forum
rather
than
in
another
alternative
forum,
it
is
going
to
complicate
this
litigation
tremendously.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well...
excuse
me.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
the...
actually
the
conflict--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--excuse
me.
the
conflict
that
we
think
is
going
to
arise
is
the
fact
that
there
are
warren
act
contractors
and
north
platte
contractors
in
wyoming,
and
the
same
with
respect
to
nebraska.
this
is
illustrated
in
the
map
at
appendix
b
of
the
special
master's
report.
so
neither
one
of
these
states
can
represent
all
of
the
contractors'
interests
that
are
involved
here.
we
think
it
would
make
more
sense,
now
that
this
case
has
been
fully
briefed
in
the
district
court,
to
allow
that
proceeding
to
go
forward
first.
if
at
some
later
point
that
question...
the
issues
that
are
resolved
there
implicate
issues
with
respect
to
the
decree,
wyoming
can
come
back
and
seek
an
amendment
of
the
decree,
or
seek
whatever
type
of
relief
that
they
might
think
is
appropriate
at
that
point,
but
this...
these
issues
have
been
litigated
in
the
district
court.
we
think
that
that
litigation
should
run
its
course
rather
than
trying
to
complicate
this
litigation
still
further.
as
a
separate
matter,
the
united
states
objects
to
wyoming's
exceptions
to
the
special
master's
report.
wyoming
is
mistaken
at
the
outset
in
characterizing
this
suit
as
an
action
to
define
the
existing
apportionment,
but
regardless
of
characterizations,
the
special
master
properly
concluded
that
wyoming's
first
counterclaim
and
first
cross-claim
should
be
denied
insofar
as
they
seek
to
replace
this
court's
percentage-based
apportionment
formula.
thank
you.
