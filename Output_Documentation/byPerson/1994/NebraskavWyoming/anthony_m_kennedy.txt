other
than
this
dispute
that
we've
discussed
over
quantity
and
percentages,
does
the
first
exception
also
involve
a
dispute
as
to
the
waters
that
are
subject
to
the
reapportionment,
or
is
that
not
part
of
the
disagreement
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
what
we're
concerned
with
is
the
pivotal
reach
area,
and
there's
no
question
but
that
the
canals
are
part
of
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
concern
that
the
evidence
on
wildlife
as
it
affects
the
irrigation
season
flows
just
expands
the
litigation
in
the
same
way
that
the
special
master
disclaims
when
he
refuses
to
allow
the
evidence
for
all
other
purposes?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
underlying
your
objection
seems
to
be
the
assumption
that
the
seasonal
flows
that
you're
concerned
with
are
requisite
for
irrigation
uses
only.
that's
not
what
the
compact
says,
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
he
wants
to
be
confident
that
his
judgment
is
neither
too
narrow
nor
too
broad,
so
he
wants
to
have
this
evidence
to
inform
him
as
to
the
effect
of
the
ruling
that
he's
asked
to
enter.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
minear,
why
can't
the
special
master
just
take
that
into
account
when
you
make
your
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
wyoming
agree
with
this
characterization
of
the
case?
does
it
join
issue
with
you
on
this
argument,
or
would
it
quarrel
with
your
formulation?
