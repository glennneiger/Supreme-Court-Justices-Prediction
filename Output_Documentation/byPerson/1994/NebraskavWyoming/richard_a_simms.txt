mr.
richard
a.
simms
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
justice
breyer,
i
want
to
go
back
to
a
question
you
asked
of
mr.
cook.
you
asked,
i
believe,
something
like,
why
didn't
you
just
come
to
the
court
on
the
theory
that
conditions
had
changed
rather
radically
since
1945
and
ask
the
court
to
do
what
we
think
you're
doing
now,
and
that
is,
changing
the
apportionment
formula?
the
answer
to
that
question,
and
it's
an
answer
that
i
think
wyoming
is
fully
aware
of,
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
had
they
done
that,
the
court
would
have
had
to
start
essentially
with
a
tabula
rasa.
that
would
mean
that
you
would
start
all
over
with
today's
equities
in
all
of
their
forums,
and
redo
the
entire
case.
that's
the
reason
they
did
not
want
to
do
it.
there
are
two
points
that
i
would
like
to
make.
first,
i
would
like
to
explain
why
the
so-called
geographical
scope
of
this
case
is
a
conceptually
ineffective
way
of
addressing
the
proposed
amendments,
and
second
i
would
like
to
explain
that
wyoming
is
attempting
to
convert
the
percentage
apportionment
into
a
mass
allocation
based
on
beneficial
use
limitations,
an
argument
made
by
wyoming
and
rejected
in
1945.
in
that
regard,
i
would
also
like
to
explain
why
the
court
should
not
upend
long-settled
expectations
that
have
become
an
intrinsic
part
of
the
apportionment
since
1945.
the
first
point
i
want
to
make
goes
to
wyoming's
second
exception.
that
is,
to
master
olpin's
understanding
that
he
must
evaluate
all
of
the
interests
in
nebraska
against
which
the
threat
of
injury
would
be
posed
by
new
development
in
wyoming.
wyoming
and
colorado's
argument
in
this
regard
is
that
you
should
not
look
at
any
uses
below
tri-state
dam
or
outside
the
irrigation
season.
accordingly,
wyoming
and
colorado
are
asking
you
not
to
take
cognizance
of
admittedly
existing
interests
outside
the
irrigation
season
or
below
tri-state
dam
that
would
or
could
be
affected
by
the
intended
development.
the
court
addressed
this
issue
in
1993,
and
i
believe
rejected
wyoming's
and
colorado's
argument.
the
court
held
that
nebraska
had
no
preexisting
rights
on
deer
creek
or
on
the
laramie
river
to
interpret
or
enforce.
at
the
same
time,
however,
the
court
provided
nebraska
with
the
opportunity
to
establish
new
development
on
deer
creek
and
on
the
laramie
river
so
that
those
equities
can
be
balanced
against
the
threat
of
injury
from
new
development
in
wyoming.
special
master
olpin
has
stated
that
he
must
balance
all
of
the
relevant
equities.
wyoming
is
simply
seeking
to
limit
nebraska's
equities.
in
order
to
reach
an
equitable
balance,
we
believe
that
the
court
must
juxtapose
all
of
the
equitable
interests
today
in
order
to
adjust
the
decree
to
meet
present
day
conditions--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--i
think
you'd
have
to
look
at
it
not
as
a
change
in
the
scope
of
the
case,
as
wyoming
would
like
you
to
see
it,
but
as
having
everything
to
do
with
the
scope
of
the
potential
injury.
what
mr.
olpin
has
done
is
to
look
at
discrete
proposed
individual
developments
in
wyoming,
think
that
certain
injury
is
going
to
flow
from
any
given
development...
for
example,
if
a
reservoir,
a
new
reservoir
would
store
and
deplete
nonirrigation
season
waters,
which
is
what
reservoirs,
after
all,
are
designed
to
do.
you
cannot
assess
the
injury
without
looking
at
the
nonirrigation
season
impacts
of
that
reservoir,
and
they
could
be
hydropower,
they
could
be
wildlife,
they
could
be
downstream
irrigation.
all
he
is
doing
is
letting...
conceptually
letting
his
mind
flow
from
the
potential
consequences
of
the
injury
that
would
arise
from
new
development
in
wyoming.
he
isn't
looking
at
the
so-called
geographic
scope
of
the
case
in
1945.
does
that
answer
your
question,
justice
o'connor?
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
don't
think
master
olpin
knows
just
what
would
come
in,
but
what
he
doesn't
want
to
do
is
put
any
preordained,
arbitrary
limits
on
the
scope
of
the
potential
injury.
he
wants
to
be
able
to
assess
what
actually
happened
as
a
result
of
new
development
in
wyoming.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
in
one
sense--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--in
one
sense
it
might
expand
the
geographic
scope
of
the
case,
but
it
would
do
so
only
as
a
response
to
the
injury
being
proposed
by
wyoming.
it
wouldn't
do
it
on
the
basis
of
anything
that
nebraska
sought
to
do.
it
would
only
be
a
reaction
to
what
we
necessarily
had
to
meet
as
a
result
of
proposed
new
development
in
wyoming.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
think
he...
i
think
the
distinction
he
draws
is
between
the
scope
of
the
injury
on
the
one
hand,
which
could
be
like
this,
and
the
scope
of
the
case
on
the
other,
and
all
he's
saying
is
that
the
two
need
to
be
equated
in
terms
of
their
latitude
when
you
make
an
initial
analysis
of
the
downstream
equities
and
weigh
those
in
the
balance
with
the
proposed--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--but
the
fact
of
the
matter--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--well,
i
think
the
geographic
scope,
justice
scalia,
is
really
arbitrary
in
advance
of
the
evidence.
there
is
no
geographic
scope.
the...
you
don't
know
what's
going
to
happen
as
a
result
of
proposed
new
development
in
wyoming
which
will
have
depletive
adverse
effects
downstream.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
those
effects
could
go
to
whalen,
they
could
go
to
tri-state,
they
could
go
to
bridgeport,
they
could
go
further
downstream.
the
master
doesn't
know
how
far
they're
going
to
go,
but
he
wants
to
be
able
to
look
at
all
of
those
effects
without
just
cutting
things
off
at
tri-state
because
that's
how
conditions
obtained
in
1945.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
well,
i
think
the
same
argument
should
have
applied
to
the
fourth
cross-claim.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
think
we're
confusing
two
things.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
i
think
justice
scalia's
talking
about
the
fourth
cross-claim.
you're
talking
about
the
fourth...
our
fourth
count.
am
i--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--okay.
the
fourth
cross-claim
goes
to
the
storage
side
of
the
issue.
back
in
1945
when
the
matter
was
addressed,
everybody
was
fully
aware
when
wyoming
argued
that
you
should
place
beneficial
use
limitations
on
wyoming,
that
you
had
to
apportion
storage
water
and
natural
flow
at
the
same
time.
in
this
regard,
wyoming
made
a
statement
in
its
response
brief
at
page
19...
let
me
quote
it
real
quickly.
"no
one
asserted
in
1945,
as
wyoming
does
now,
a
need
for
the
court
affirmatively
to
require
the
bureau's
compliance
with
federal
law.
"
"such
compliance
was
assumed.
"
"thus,
the
issue
that
wyoming's
fourth
cross-claim
would
bring
was
not
before
the
court
in
1945.
"
well,
in
1945,
that
statement
was
most
certainly
not
true.
what
wyoming
did
in
1945
was
to
assert
that
storage
water
in
section
8
of
the
reclamation
act
as
well
as
the
related
federal
and
state
law
had
to
be
brought
before
the
court's
attention
and
had
to
actually
be
placed
in
the
decree,
in
special
provisions
in
the
decree
to
make
the
decree
enforceable
as
against
the
storage
water
contracts
and
the
storage
water
deliveries.
wyoming's
view
at
the
time
was,
if
those
provisions
were
not
placed
in
the
decree,
that
the
only
redress
would
be
found
in
federal
district
court.
that
is,
the
contracts
would
be
enforced
as
it
was
assumed
that
they
would
be
enforced,
but
that
could
be
done
only
among
the
proper
parties
and
in
the
proper
forum.
we
do
believe
that
there
is
an
inconsistency
between
the
master's
recommendation
with
respect
to
the
first
counterclaim
on
the
one
hand
and
the
fourth
cross-claim
on
the
other,
but
i
think
an
analysis
of
what
he
did
and
a
close
evaluation
of
the
briefs
would
lend
itself
more
to
our
view
than
his
on
that
matter.
the
second
point
i
would
like
to
make
is
that
the
court
rejected
the
theory
of
beneficial
use
limitations
in
1945
for
three
sound
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
court
found
that
this
river
fluctuates
at
polar
extremes.
in
the
pivotal
reach,
the
court
found
that
you
had
to
have
some
sort
of--
mr.
richard
a.
simms
--this
is
addressed
to
wyoming's
first
exception,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
simms
the
court
found
that
you
had
to
have
some
formula
that
was
responsive
to
changes
in
supply.
the
second
reason
the
court
did
not
adopt
the
beneficial
use
limitations
is
that
the
court
knew
that
storage
was
essential
to
doing
any
kind
of
mass
allocation
based
on
beneficial
use.
third,
the
court
did
not
adopt
the
beneficial
use
theory
because
that
would
have
required
placing
limitations
on
individual
irrigation
districts
and
private
canals
that
were
not
in
the
case,
and
the
court
simply
doesn't
do
that
kind
of
stuff
in
parens
patriae
actions.
those
three
conditions
have
not
changed.
the
river
still
fluctuates
wildly,
you
would
still
have
to
apportion
both
storage
water
and
natural
flow,
and
you
don't
define
private
rights
in
parens
patriae
cases.
given
that
problem,
what
distinguishes
the
so-called
inconsistency
argument
that
wyoming
has
made,
what
distinguishes
what
we're
proposing
and
what
wyoming
is
proposing,
is
that
wyoming
has
something
in
the
nature
of
a
res
judicata
problem,
or
at
least
a
repose
and
finality
problem.
finally,
this
court
has
always
been
reluctant
to
reopen
an
apportionment,
and
you've
been
reluctant
to
do
that
for
good
reason.
once
an
apportionment
is
adopted,
and
this
one
is
some
50
years
old,
all
kinds
of
socioeconomic
institutional
reliance
develops
in
layers
on
that
apportionment.
in
this
case,
wyoming
wants
to
completely
upend
that
apportionment
and
replace
it,
and
we
do
not
think
that
that
would
be
a
wise
idea.
we
do
not
want
you
to
upset
long
settled
expectations
on
the
north
platte.
finally,
i
would
point
out
that
in
all
of
these
pleading
amendments
nebraska
wants
no
new
water.
wyoming
does.
nebraska
wants
to
maintain
the
status
quo,
wyoming
wants
to
upset
the
status
quo.
nebraska
wants
to...
i
see
my
time
is
up.
thank
you
very
much.
