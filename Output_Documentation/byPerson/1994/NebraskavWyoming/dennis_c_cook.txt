mr.
dennis
c.
cook
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
an
original
action
brought
by
the
state
of
nebraska
against
the
state
of
wyoming
in
1986
involving
the
equitable
apportionment
of
the
north
platte
river.
questions
involving
the
north
platte
are
not
new
to
the
court.
the
north
platte
was
equitably
apportioned
by
the
court
in
1945,
and
unlike
the
case
of
kansas
v.
colorado
that
you've
just
heard,
the
court
is
not
called
upon
in
this
case
to
decide
questions
of
fact.
instead,
the
court
has
before
it
exceptions
of
the
special
master's
report
on
nebraska's
third
motion
to
amend
its
1986
petition,
and
wyoming's
first
motion
to
amend
its
1987
counterclaims.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
that's
correct,
your
honor.
wyoming
brings
four
exceptions.
the
first
regards
the
recommended
denial
of
wyoming's
first
amended
counterclaim
and
cross-claim,
second
the
announced
intent
to
have
a
trial
on
issues
below
tri-state
diversion
dam,
despite
the
exclusion
of
that
in
other
parts
of
his
ruling,
third,
the
inclusion
of
horse
creek
in
the
claims
nebraska
can
litigate,
and
fourth,
the
inclusion
of
the
groundwater
issue
in
the
litigation.
the
decision
on
the
issues
raised
by
the
parties'
exceptions
is
crucial,
now,
to
break
this
endless
circle
of
debate
about
which
claims
are
in
this
case,
what
the
geographic
limits
of
this
case
are,
and
that
decision
then
will
instruct
the
parties
and
will
shape
the
course
of
trial
in
the
future.
my
argument
will
focus
on
first
the
unfairness
of
the
special
master's
recommendation
to
deny
wyoming's
first
counterclaim
and
first
cross-claim,
and
second,
upon
the
impact
of
the
special
master's
proposed
trial
plans,
the
impact
those
plans
will
have
on
the
certainty
and
stability
of
the
court's
1945
apportionment
that
ended
nebraska's
apportionment
at
tri-state
diversion
dam.
with
regard
to
the
special
master's
recommendations
on
wyoming's
first
counterclaim
and
first
cross-claim,
wyoming
believes
that
it
is
unfair,
on
the
one
hand,
to
deny
a
trial
or
any
affirmative
relief
at
this
stage
on
wyoming's
claims
that
nebraska
and
the
united
states
circumvent
the
apportionment,
when
on
the
other
hand
the
court
and
the
special
master
would
entertain
a
trial
on
very
similar
issues
raised
by
nebraska
with
regard
to
the
development
of
tributaries
in
wyoming.
to
get
to
the
point
where
the
special
master
did
to
deny
wyoming's
first
counterclaims,
he
saw
too
much
in
a
decision
in
1993
of
this
court
that
said
there
are
no
current
limits
on
the
state
of
nebraska's
diversions
in
this
pivotal
reach
of
the
river
between
whalen
diversion
dam
and
tri-state
diversion
dam.
he
found
that
that
answered
the
question
completely
with
respect
to
wyoming's
counterclaims,
but
it
did
not.
wyoming's
counterclaim
is
that
nebraska
circumvents.
now
it
is
that
the
united
states
participates
in
the
circumvention,
but
nonetheless,
wyoming
argues
that
they
violate
the
apportionment.
nebraska
in
19...
throughout
this
case
and
part
of
the
1993
decision,
ruled
that...
or
argued
that
wyoming
violated
the
apportionment
by
constructing
projects
on
tributaries
in
wyoming.
the
court
ruled
indeed
there
are
no
restrictions
on
those
tributaries,
but
yes,
nebraska,
you
can
come
forward
and
seek
to
modify
the
decree
and
to
add
those
restrictions.
the
court
has
now
similarly
found
that
there
are
no
limits
on
nebraska's
diversions,
but
it's
wyoming's
position
that
the
court
has
not
rejected
the
possibility
that
wyoming
could
seek
to
have
those
restrictions
added,
that
definition
of--
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
--that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
that
is
not
wyoming's
purpose.
wyoming's
purpose
is
to
stop
the
circumvention
of
the
decree.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
i
believe
that's
correct.
i
believe
he
focuses
on
the
type
of
amendment
that
the
court
might
enter,
how
it
would
amend
the
1945
decree,
rather
than
the
question
of
whether
it
should
be
amended,
and
where
wyoming
is
at
at
this
point
is
the
request
to
go
to
trial
to
seek
the
need
to
amend
the
decree.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
no.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
your
honor,
we
would
add
to
the
75-25
apportionment
further
definition
of
nebraska's
water
right,
and
what...
and
the
reason
i
say
that,
the
basis
for
the
court
granting
jurisdiction
over
the
circumvention
claim
as
you've
announced--
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
--that's
very
likely,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
it
is
an
addition
to
that
approach,
but
let
me
explain
why
it's
appropriate
for
the
court
to
consider
that,
and
it's
appropriate
because
in
1945
the
united
states
brought
the
proposition
to
the
court
that
without
a
further
definition
in
terms
of
quantity
instantaneous
diversion
rates
imposed
on
nebraska's
apportionment,
that
they
would
indeed
circumvent
the
decree,
or
the
apportionment.
the
court
said,
we
won't
speculate
that
nebraska
will
do
that,
and
we
see
no
need
to
go
beyond
the
75-25
split
of
the
natural
flow
at
this
point
in
time,
but
if
that
case
develops,
you
may
come
back
to
the
court
and
ask
for
those
additional...
that
additional
definition
on
nebraska's
apportionment.
and
that's
the
basic
foundation,
the
unanswered
question,
or
the
reserved
question
the
court
had
agreed
early
on
in
1987
to
accept
and
allow
wyoming
to
pursue
in
its
counterclaim,
and
our
first
counterclaim,
amended
counterclaim,
is
virtually
the
same
counterclaim
we
brought
to
you
in
1987,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
i
think
that's
a
clear
characterization
of
where
this
case
could
end
up,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
let
me
suggest
to
the
court
that
as
we've
said
in
our
briefs
and
throughout
this
amended
pleadings
phase
that
there's
something
different
between
the
decree
and
the
apportionment.
the
apportionment
is
to
protect
lands
and
the
irrigation
of
lands
that
received
water
from
that
critical
reach
of
the
river.
the
apportionment
ends
at
tri-state
diversion
dam.
the
decree
is
merely
a
tool
to
implement
that
apportionment,
and
nebraska...
and
the
court
has
accepted
and
we
recognize
that
we
will
go
to
trial
for
nebraska
to
try
to
amend,
to
add
injunctions
against
wyoming
to
change
that
decree
to
give
full
effect
to
its
apportionment,
to
bring
a
quantity...
to
ensure
that
a
quantity
of
water
becomes
available
in
that
critical
reach.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
i
don't
believe
that's
part
of
the
disagreement
on
the
first
counterclaim.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
that's
correct.
the
point
that
we
make
is
that
the
court
has
passed
on
this
question.
there
has
been
no
change
since
1987,
when
you
agreed
to
accept
this
claim,
and
there's
no
reason
to
reverse
the
court's
decision.
quite
frankly,
in
199--
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
--correct.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
he
very
well
could
be
thinking
that.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
the
what's
wrong
is
that
wyoming
has
always
sought
injunctions
to
prevent
the
future
circumvention,
the
continued
circumvention
of
the
decree.
wyoming
always
posed
the
thought
that
there
would
be
something
new
added
to
the
decree
to
accomplish
its
purpose,
so
we've
not...
we
use
the
word
1993
decision.
pardon
me?
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
i
don't
know.
we
clearly
had
that
in
mind,
your
honor,
but
we
don't
want
to
presume
what
the
remedy
would
be,
necessarily,
at
the
beginning.
let
me
suggest,
thought,
that
one
of
the
real...
another
problem
is
that
the
court
has,
or
the
special
master
recommends
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
this
claim
after
there's
been
clearly
an
understanding
that
even
peripheral
issues
surrounding
wyoming's
counterclaims
require
factual
development
to
get
at,
and
neither
of
the
parties
sought
summary
judgment
in
the
prior
proceedings,
because
there
are
questions
of
material
fact
in
dispute
about
wyoming's
counterclaims,
therefore,
we're
caught
up
in
a
situation
where
we
will
now
be...
lose
forever
the
opportunity
to
bring
a
circumvention
claim
if
you
adopt
the
special
master's
recommendation.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
right.
he
suggests
that
we
can
bring
it...
we
can
defend
against
nebraska's
claims
with
essentially
the
same
proof,
and
our
point
is
that
if
the
case
is
going
to
have
that
evidence,
or
that
type
of
evidence
in
front
of
it,
and
the
court
will
have
that
kind
of
evidence
in
front
of
it
anyway,
what
is
to
be
gained
by
limiting
the
remedies
that
would
be
available
to
wyoming
using
that
same
proof,
or
that
same
type
proof.
further,
i've
never
been
fond
of
structuring
my
case
in
a
responsive
manner
when
it
would
rely
on
certain
claims
being
brought
by
nebraska
to
defend
against.
that
would
prevent
me
from
maybe
getting
the
full
picture
on
defense
from
the
court.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
wyoming's--
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
--because
the
united
states
has
brought
the
operation
of
its
federal
storage
facilities
and
its
ability
to
deliver
water
under
its
contracts
into
this
case
when
it
argued
that
deer
creek
should
not
be
built
because
it
would
in
fact
impact
that
operation.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
no,
wyoming
isn't
a
party,
and
that's
why
this
case,
there
is
a
private
suit
going
on,
but
that's
why
this
case
and
this
court
is
a
more
appropriate
forum,
because
the
state
parties
and
equitable
apportionment
underlies
or
is
involved
in
this
whole
matter
of
interpretation
of
federal
contracts
and
federal
law.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
the
master,
we
agree
with
his
proposition
on
the
fourth
cross-claim.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
well,
there's
no
evidence
at
all
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
in
fact
we
have...
in
the
process
of
summary
judgment
proceedings
have
affidavits
that
indicate
the
type
of
injury
wyoming
will
produce.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
two
types
of
users,
those
that
are
regulated
in
priority
because
the
federal
reservoirs
are
unnecessarily
depleted
more
than
they
should
be,
priority
regulation,
and
prohibits--
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
--that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
and
second,
the
wyoming
users
in
the
pivotal
reach
are
subject
to
more
frequent
shortages
of
water.
i
think
i
can
sum
up
our
proposition
on
that
as
that
the
united
states
cannot
make
the
distribution
of
federal
storage
a
central
issue
in
this
case
and
then
suggest
those
issues
are
more
perfectly
decided
somewhere
else.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
last
things
first.
issues
in
the
gid
case
versus
the
issue
in
our
fourth
cross-claim,
our
fourth
cross-claim
is
much
broader.
it
is
our
claim
that
the
operation
of
the
storage
facilities
was
a
predicate
of
the
75-25
apportionment,
as
justice
breyer
has
noted,
and
therefore,
as
that
predicate
operation
changes
and
is
no
longer
according
to
law,
or
according
to
contracts,
then
that
clearly
skews
the
entire
process,
and
quite
frankly
the
court
left
open
the
door
to
look
at
allocation
and
storage.
it
did
not
foreclose
that,
and
furthermore
it
has
allocated
storage
in
both
paragraph
iii
and
paragraph
iv
of
the
decree.
further--
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
--the
interests
of
others,
all
residents
of
the
state,
are
implicated
in
this
case
any
time
we
are
here
in
the
court's
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
dennis
c.
cook
they
are,
but
in
one
respect
we
stand
in
judgment
in
parens
patriae
for
the
overall
operation.
individual
disputes
on
individual
years,
individual
grievances,
those
can
be
adjusted,
but
what
we're
talking
about
is
the
broader
failure
to
follow
the
law
that
impacts
the
apportionment.
let
me
say
also
that
beneficial
use
is
a
predicate.
it
was
not
necessary
to
say
that
word
in
the
decree
because
it's
such
a
fundamental
concept
that
this
court
has
continued
to
recognize,
and
i
say
that
because
the
opposite
side
of
beneficial
use
is
waste
and
misuse,
and
this
court
has
never
sanctioned
one
state
to
waste
and
misuse
water
at
the
expense
of
another.
finally,
i
agree
that
this
court
is
reluctant
to
open
apportionments
and
revisit
those.
i
disagree
that
there
is
not
an
established
apportionment
at
tri-state
that
sets
the
established
expectations
of
the
parties.
