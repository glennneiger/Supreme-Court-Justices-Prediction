we'll
hear

next
in
number

nebraska
v.
wyoming
and
colorado.
mr.
cook.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there's
been
no
trial
before
the...
the
master
hasn't
found
facts
and
reached
any
conclusion.
we're
still
waiting
to
go
to
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
presume
wyoming
would
plan
to
introduce
some
evidence
if
it's
allowed
to
proceed
on
that
counterclaim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
cook.
mr.
tymkovich,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
joining
in
which
exceptions
here,
mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--of
which--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--exception
2
of
wyoming.
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
speaking
of
deference,
mr.
tymkovich,
isn't
a
kind
of
special
deference
owed
to
the
master
in
structuring
the
trial?
i
mean,
he's
not
opining
on
any
issue
of
law.
he's
not
really
making
any
factual
determination.
he's
really
just
trying
to
decide
how
best
to
let
in
the
evidence
and
what
should
connect
with
what.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
mr.
simms,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
addressed
to
a
particular
exception?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
wyoming--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
simms.
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
minear,
you
distinguish
between
the
natural
flow
and
the
storage
water.
where
does
the
storage
water
come
from
if
it's
not
from
the
natural
flow?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
it's
not
needed
elsewhere.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
this
the
district
court
action
in
wyoming?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
we're
told
there
is
such
an
action
and
the
government
has
pleaded
sovereign
immunity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
consideration
of
the
argument
in
this
case?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
consideration
of
the
forthcoming
argument
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
cook,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cook.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinions
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases
in
the
first
of
them
number
108
original,
the
state
of
nebraska
versus
state
of
wyoming
comes
to
us
on
exception
to
an
interim
report
of
the
special
master.
the
north
platte
river
rises
in
northern
colorado
and
flows
through
wyoming
into
nebraska
where
it
joins
the
south
platte
to
form
the
platte
river.
in
1934
nebraska
invoked
our
original
jurisdiction
by
suing
wyoming
to
obtain
an
equitable
apportionment
of
the
waters
of
the
north
platte
river
and
the
ensuing
litigation
culminated
11
years
later
in
a
decree
of
this
court
which
did
apportionment
of
flow
the
north
platte.
then
in
1986,
nebraska
returned
to
this
court,
saying
that
wyoming
was
threatening
its
equitable
apportionment
primarily
by
planning
water
projects
on
tributaries
that
have
historically
contributed
significant
flows
to
the
north
platte.
we
granted
nebraska
leave
to
follow
its
petition
allows
wyoming
to
file
a
counterclaim.
nebraska
and
wyoming
later
sought
leave
to
amend
their
pleadings
and
we
received
all
these
matters
to
refer
them
to
a
special
master.
the
master
is
now
reported
and
while
we
overrule
all
of
the
exceptions.
wyoming
has
filed
four
exceptions
to
the
master's
recommendations,
we
overrule
each
of
them.
nebraska
and
united
states
have
each
filed
a
single
and
largely
overlapping
exception
which
we
also
overrule.
justice
thomas
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
in
part.
