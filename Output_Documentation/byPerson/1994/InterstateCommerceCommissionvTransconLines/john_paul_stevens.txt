paul

what...
are
there
any
valid
applications
of
the
regulations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
commission's
only
remedy
is
to
an
injunction
against
future
extensions--
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
regulations
on
their
face
do
command
conduct
that
the
icc
can
command.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
your
client
has
not
obeyed
that
command?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
remedy
is
available
today
for
the
violations
of
the
credit
regulations
by
the
carriers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
that's
if
the
rate
is...
for
violation
of
the
credit
regulations,
what
would
the
reparations
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
it
impose
a
penalty
equal
to
the
amount
you
seek
to
collect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
could
it
calculate
a
per-day
penalty
that
would
bring
out
that
result
and
say,
once
you
get
to
this
limit,
you
can't
collect
anything
more?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
thing
that
i'm
puzzled
about
is,
there's
a
valid
regulation
out
there
that's
been
violated,
and
the
commission
says
they
want
this
remedy,
and
you're
saying,
well,
there's
some
other
remedy,
but
the
other
remedy
that
you
describe
is
the
functional
equivalent
of
this
one,
as
i
understand
it.
