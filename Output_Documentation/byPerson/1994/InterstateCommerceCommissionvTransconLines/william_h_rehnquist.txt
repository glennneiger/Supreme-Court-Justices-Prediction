chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
93-1318,
interstate
commerce
commission
v.
transcon
lines.
spectators
are
admonished
not
to
talk
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
you
may
proceed,
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
gumport.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
simply
because
of
the
term...
the
statute
says
one
of
the
things
is
preventing
discrimination?
you
place
all
that
weight
on
those
two
words?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
shouldn't
the
commission
have
considerable
discretion
in
interpreting
its
own
regulation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
seems
to...
i
still
think
that
just
puts
a
great
deal
of
weight,
that
it
won't
bear,
on
two
words
in
a
fairly
long
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
realize.
i
simply
disagree
with
you
on
it,
and
you
also
rely
very
heavily
on
maislin,
but
there
have
been
two
cases
since
then
which
suggest
that
maislin,
you
know,
is
not
the
be-all
and
end-all
in
this
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gumport.
mr.
wallace,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
mr.
wallace,
tell
me
why
this
is
different
from
the
case
where...
that
justice
ginsburg
asked
about.
even
if
the
filed
rate
violated
the
statute,
the
filed
rate
doctrine
would
apply,
and
it
would
have
to
be
set
aside
before
it
could
be
collected,
and
you're
coming
in
and
saying,
ah,
but
if
it
violates
a
regulation,
that's
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
