mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
since
1920,
the
interstate
commerce
act
has
prohibited
common
carriers
from
delivering
freight
on
credit
except
pursuant
to
regulations
adopted
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
governing
credit
transactions,
and
that
prohibition
was
extended
to
motor
carriers
when
they
came
under
the
icc's
jurisdiction
in
the
motor
carrier
act
of
1935.
prior
thereto,
it
was
focused
on
railroads,
of
course.
the
icc
first
adopted
credit
regulations
in
1920
and
from
1920
until
1988
those
regulations
contained
no
authorization
of
liquidated
damages
for
late
payment
of
freight
charges.
the
only
authorized
remedy
was
to
collect
the
prescribed
rate
for
a
timely
payment
plus
interest
for
the
delay.
in
rulemakings
in
the
late
1980's,
the
icc
for
the
first
time,
at
the
behest
of
the
american
trucking
association
and
other
carrier
interests,
authorized
liquidated
damages
for
collection
expense
charges
in
the
regulations,
and
those
are
set
forth
beginning
at
page
83a
of
the
appendix
to
our
petition,
subpart
g
of
the
regulations,
entitled
"collection
expense
charges".
in
an
amicus
brief
filed
in
our
support
by
the
health
&
personal
care
distribution
conference
and
some
other
shipping
associations,
on
page
4
and
5,
the
course
of
the
rulemaking
proceedings
is
recounted
and
the
citations
are
given.
the
shipping
interests
were,
of
course,
participants
and
quite
concerned
about
unfairness
to
them
that
may
eventuate
and,
because
of
that,
the
icc
included
initially
in
the
1988
regulations
and
added
in
the
revised
regulations
in
1989
certain
conditions
for
the
collection
of
these
liquidated
damages
which,
it
is
undisputed,
were
not
complied
with
in
this
case.
those
include
from,
beginning
with
the
provision
that
was
in
the
original
1988
regulations
and
was
retained,
a
requirement
that
the
original
bills
advise
shippers
of
the
consequence
of
late
payment.
that
is
set
forth
on
page
86a.
it's
subpart
(c).
and
the
two
provisions
that
were
added
in
1989
to
further
protect
shippers
from
the
unfair
practices
are
set
forth
first
on
page
85a,
and
that
is
subpart
(g)(2)(vi),
that
revised
bills
have
to
be
issued
within
a
90-day
period
after
the
original
credit
period
had
expired.
that
also
admittedly
was
not
complied
with.
and
then
on
page
84,
subpart
(iii)
of
(g)(2),
it
says
that
the
loss
of
discount,
or
the
liquidated
damages,
cannot
be
applied
on
an
aggregated
basis
but
can
only
be
applied
on
separate
and
independent
freight
bills.
there
are
obviously
great
economies
of
scale
in
aggregate
collections,
and
there
was
concern
that
aggregate
collections
would
be
made,
particularly
after
carriers
became
insolvent,
and
there's
a
specific
reference
in
that
provision
to
a
bankruptcy
trustee
attempting
to
collect
on
an
aggregate
basis.
so
what
we
are
concerned
with
here
is
an
effort
that
was
made
by
respondent,
as
the
trustee
for
this
insolvent
carrier,
to
bill
shippers
from
several
years
earlier
and
collect
additional
payments,
including
these
very
heavy
liquidated
damage
charges,
an
effort
that
was
specifically
foreseen
by
the
commission
in
adopting
the
regulations
authorizing
credit
transactions,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
it
would
be
the
same
discount
rate
that
applies
to
the
credit
transactions,
plus
there
can
be
a
service
charge
for
the
delayed
payment
in
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
could
be,
and
as
far
as
i'm
aware
was,
the
same
discount
rate,
although
there
might
be
some
further
discount
for
cash
payment
which
is
not
reflected
in
anything
i've
read
in
this
case.
perhaps
mr.
gumport
could
clarify
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
it
does
not.
there's
no
indication
that
it
does.
it
is
not...
it
is
a
source
from
which
the
real
rates,
the
real
filed
rates
are...
the
discount
rates,
it's
a
source
from
which
the
discount
rates
are
calculated.
so
that
it's
a
source...
it's
a
rate
bureau
source
that
determines
the
proportionality
of
what
are
the
real
rates,
which
are
the
discount
rates,
and
the
only
way
that
this
record
reflects
that
those
rates
come
into
play
at
all
is
not
as
what
i
think
are
accurately
regarded
as
rates
for
transportation,
but
as
the
measure
of
the
liquidated
damages
for
collection
costs
that
is
authorized
under
these
regulations
under
the
collection
expense
charges
in
little
point
(ii)
at
the
top
of
page
84a
of
the
appendix.
that
is
one
method
of
calculating
liquidated
damages
that
is
authorized
under
this
rule,
if
the
rule
is
complied
with.
now,
the
rule
was
designed
specifically
to
forestall
precisely
the
problem
that
arose
here
by
conditioning
the
availability
of
these
liquidated
damage
charges
on
compliance
with
certain
safeguards
for
the
shippers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
ordinarily
it's...
it's
the
other
way
around
that
it
occurs.
the
shippers
have
made
their
payments
and
would
not
be
bringing
an
action.
it's
the
trustee
who
is
trying
to
get
additional
payments
from
the
shippers
through
the
bankruptcy
proceedings.
he
has
made
claims
against
them,
and
the...
this
court's
holding
in
southern
pacific
transportation
company
v.
commercial
metals
suggests
that
the
shippers
cannot
themselves
raise
a
defense,
and
we
have
briefed
the
case
on
that
assumption.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
have
briefed
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
it
would
not
be
available
to
the
shippers
under
the
rationale
of
the
commercial
metals
case,
but
i
think
in
candor
an
argument
could
be
made
that
commercial
metals
should
not
extend
that
far
because
what
was
directly
involved
in
commercial
metals
was
an
effort
not
to
pay
the
transportation
rate
itself,
which--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
do
take
some
solace
from
the
k
mart
case.
i
don't
want
to
overdraw
the
analogy,
because
the
court
determined
there
that
there
was
no
valid,
filed
rate.
there
was
a
rate
that
could
be
ascertained
from
tariff
filings
and
the
court
said
that
that
could
not
prevail
over
a
violation
of
the
commission's
regulations,
and
in
that
way
the
case
is
very
analogous
to
our
case.
but
commercial
metals
held,
in
the
context
of
an
effort
by
the
shipper
not
to
pay
the
transportation
charge
at
all,
the
transportation
rate,
that
the
shipper
could
not
raise
that
as
a
defense,
that
if
there's
to
be
a
challenge
to
it
because
of
violation
of
the
commission's
credit
regulations,
and
that
is
the
only
case
of
this
court
that
deals
with
a
claim
of
violation
of
the
credit
regulations,
that
is
to
be
enforced
in
the
courts
by
the
icc.
the
reason
i
think
that
an
argument
could
be
made
by
shippers
that
commercial
metals
doesn't
extend
as
far
as
this
case
is
because
in
this
case
what
is
sought
to
be
collected
is
not
the
rate
for
transportation
or
services
that
the
statute
requires
to
be
in
a
tariff
as
a
rate
filing.
that
rate
is
what
would
be
payable
in
the
transaction
if
the
payment
were
made
promptly,
plus
whatever
interest
there
would
be
for
delay
in
payment,
precisely
what
the
icc's
requested
injunction
would
limit
the
trustee
to
collecting
here.
what
is
sought
to
be
collected
in
addition
are
these
liquidated
damages
called
collection
expense
charges
authorized
by
the
regulation
beginning
on
page
83a,
which
are
in
the
tariff,
but
not
because
the
statute
requiring
the
rates
for
transportation
or
services
require
it
to
be
in
the
tariff...
those
statutes
we've
set
forth
in
our
brief
on
page
74a
and
75a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition...
but
instead
it's
because
the
regulation
itself
requires
that
those
liquidated
damage
rates
be
in
the
tariff.
they're
entirely
a
creature
of
the
regulation,
and
that
is
on
84a
of
the
petition
appendix
under
2(i),
"shall
be
described
in
the
tariff
rule.
"
and
(ii)
says,
"shall
be
applied
without
unlawful
prejudice
and/or
unjust
discrimination.
"
those
requirements
are
creatures
of
the
regulation,
just
as
the
authorization
to
collect
these
charges
at
all
are
creatures
of
the
regulation,
and
the
commission,
as
i
started
to
say
at
the
outset,
is
acting
in
an
area
where
congress
expressly
relied
on
the
commission's
regulations
to
set
the
rule.
congress
proscribed
altogether
any
credit
transactions
here
except
pursuant
to
regulations
which
the
commission
may
adopt,
so
the
commission
was
acting
really
at
the
zenith
of
its
regulatory
powers
in
fulfilling
a
mandate
that
congress
expressly
relied
on
the
commission
and
only
the
commission
to
fulfill
here.
so
regardless
of
whether
the
shippers
could
raise
a
defense,
what
commercial
metals
looked
to
was
an
even
more
venerable
provision
of
the
act
that
dates
back
to
the
original
interstate
commerce
act
in
1887,
the
statutory
authority
for
the
commission
to
bring
an
enforcement
action
in
federal
court,
and
the
court
in
commercial
metals
emphasized
that
that
could
be
an
injunctive
action
to
enforce
the
credit
regulations.
it
should
be
remembered
that
at
the
time
of
the
commercial
metals
decision
in
1982,
the
credit
regulations
did
not
yet
authorize
this
liquidated
damages
for
the
cost
of
collection,
and
the
only
defense
being
made
by
the
shipper
was
a
defense
not
to
have
to
pay
the
filed
rate
for
transportation
itself.
so
there
might
have
been
anticipation
that
the
commission
would
be
unlikely
to
bring
an
injunctive
action
which
would
say
that
the
carrier
should
not
be
paid
at
all
for
the
transportation,
even
in
the
circumstance
where
the
carrier
did
not
fully
comply
with
the
credit
regulations,
but
at
least
as
the
court
interpreted
the
act,
that
was
to
be
left
to
the
commission's
enforcement
authority
rather
than
an
equitable
defense
by
the
shippers.
well,
since
the
conditions
admittedly
were
not
complied
with
for
assessing
the
liquidated
damages,
it
might
seem
obvious,
in
light
of
commercial
metals
and
the
commission's
enforcement
authority
in
49
u.s.c.
11702
that
i've
referred
to,
that
the
commission's
action
to
enjoin
this
belated
effort
of
the
trustee
acting
in
perfect
good
faith
to
try
to
enhance
the
value
of
the
estate,
to
enjoin
this
effort
to
collect
liquidated
damages
when
these
very
carefully
constructed
conditions
had
not
been
complied
with
to
the
obvious
prejudice
of
the
shippers
whom
the
conditions
were
designed
to
protect,
and
that
the
trustee,
standing
in
the
shoes
of
transcon,
should
be
relegated
to
the
historic
remedy
that
existed
from
1920
to
1988
of
the
transportation
charge
plus
interest
for
any
lateness
in
the
payment,
obviously
a
remedy
that
could
not
be
said
to
be
incompatible
with
the
act.
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
said
no,
that
that
rather
obvious
conclusion
should
not
be
reached
because
of
the
filed
rate
doctrine
as
it
understood
that
doctrine
to
have
been
applied
by
this
court
in
maislin
industries
v.
primary
steel.
now,
we
think
that
this
was
misconceived
by
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
outset,
and
the
first
thing
to
be
said
is
that
maislin,
in
contrast
to
this
case,
involved
an
effort
to
enforce
an
unfiled
rate,
the
negotiated
rate
which
was
never
filed,
but
under
the
commission's
then
negotiated
rates
policy
was
to
be
enforced
in
preference
to
the
actual
filed
rate.
and
maislin
itself,
in
footnote
11
of
the
maislin
opinion,
pointed
out
that
the
case
was
therefore
different
from
prior
decisions
of
the
court
in
which
the
question
was
which
of
two
filed
rates
should
be
applied,
rather
than
an
effort
to
depart
from
the
filed
rate
schedule
altogether.
and
we
think
that
that
footnote
applies
a
fortiori
in
this
case,
because
here
it's
not
a
choice
between
two
filed
rates
for
transportation,
it's
a
choice
between
the
filed
rate
for
transportation,
which
the
commission
says
the
trustee
is
entitled
to,
and
this
other
charge
of
liquidated
damages
that
is
not
a
filed
rate
for
transportation
within
the
meaning
of
the
statutes
that
require
rates
for
transportation
and
services
to
be
provided,
but
as
i
previously
explained
is
entirely
a
creature
of
the
regulations
which
is
required
to
be
in
the
tariff
only
because
the
regulations
require
it
to
be
in
the
tariff.
that
is
the
source
of
the
obligation.
then
this
court
decided
reiter
v.
cooper
after
the
court
of
appeals'
initial
decision,
which
we
thought
made
the
error
more
manifest
because
reiter
established
quite
clearly
the
principle
that
maislin
did
not
mean
that
the
filed
rate
doctrine
would
preclude
claims
and
defenses
that
are
specifically
accorded
by
the
act
itself,
such
as
the
commission's
express
statutory
authority
to
bring
an
action
for
an
injunction
to
enforce
its
credit
regulations.
so
when
we
petitioned
for
certiorari
for
the
first
time
in
this
case,
we
suggested
that
the
judgment
be
vacated
and
the
case
remanded
for
reconsideration
in
light
of
reiter
v.
cooper,
which
is
the
course
that
the
court
took,
but
on
remand
the
court
of
appeals
reached
the
same
conclusion,
basically
holding
that
the
icc
statutory
enforcement
authority
should
be
subordinated
to
its
view
of
the
filed
rate
doctrine,
which
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
was
rebriefed,
i'm
told.
i
have
to
get
some
help
from
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--not
reargued,
just
rebriefed,
apparently.
so
it
seemed
to
us
that
what
the
court
held
was
merely,
to
the
contrary
of
reiter,
that
the
express
statutory
provision
should
be
subordinated
to
the
court's
view
of
the
filed
rate
doctrine,
which
is
just
the
opposite
of
the
way
the
court
came
out
in
reiter.
and
it
also...
in
its
rationale
on
remand
it
seemed
to
us
the
court
intruded
into
and
effectively
nullified
the
icc's
enforcement
discretion
with
respect
to
what
remedy
it
can
seek
among
the
remedies
expressly
given
to
the
commission
for
the
credit
regulation
violations,
and
the
ninth
circuit
said
other
remedies
will
suffice.
but
those
other
remedies,
while
they
might
suffice
against
operating
characters...
carriers
because
of
their
prospective
nature,
would
be
of
little
assistance,
if
any,
in
the
context
of
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy,
who
is
trying
to
dun
shippers
for
these
charges
years
after
the
shipment.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
wouldn't
say
quite
that
they
don't
enjoy
the
protections,
but
it
is
important
that
they're
not
required
by
statute
to
be
filed
rates
that
govern,
rather
than
any
contract
to
the
contrary,
the
payment
for
transportation
and
services,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
think
that
these
are
rules
relating
to
the
rates,
rather
than
rates
themselves,
rules
about
what
is
to
be
done
in
the
nonpayment,
but
part
of
the
relevance
of
this
in
the
case
is
that
respondents
are
arguing
in
some
of
their
amici
that
there
would
be
discrimination
if
these
rates
were
not
evenhandedly
applied
to
all
shippers,
even
though
long
after
the
fact
and
even
though
there
were
violations
of
these
regulations,
but
the
prohibition--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
don't
want
to
make
their
argument
for
them.
what
i'm
trying
to
point
out
is
that
the
prohibition
against
unjust
discrimination
that
is
involved
here
is
only
the
prohibition
in
the
commission's
own
regulations,
which
the
commission
is
entitled
to
considerable
deference
in
construing,
since
these
charges
are
entirely
a
creature
of
these
regulations
to
begin
with.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
isn't
the
only
thing
that
i'm
saying.
it's...
the
suggestion
that
the
commission
could
strike
this
provision
is
really
a
rather
impractical
one.
there's
nothing
on
its
face
that's
incompatible
with
the
statute
or
the
regulation.
this,
the
liquidated
damages
provision
as
it
appears
in
the
tariff
could
have
been
lawfully
enforced
if
the
conditions
that
were
not
complied
with
had
been
complied
with,
so
there
was
no
basis
for
striking
it
from
the
tariff.
if
the
tariff
had
also
said,
and
these
liquidated
damages
can
be
assessed
on
an
aggregated
basis,
not
merely
on
an
individual
basis,
that
would
have
been
a
provision
that
the
commission
could
have
struck
from
the
tariff.
but
what
good
would
it
have
done
the
commission
to
strike
that
from
the
tariff
when
under
the
respondent's
submission
the
same
result
could
be
reached
anyway,
because
the
liquidated
damages
provision
itself
remains
in
the
tariff,
and
that
has
to
be
enforceable
regardless
of
violations
of
the
safeguards
that
were
placed
in
the
commission's
regulation.
and
i
want
to
say,
in
response
to
a
question
raised
by
justice
ginsburg,
on
page
33a
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
appendix
the
court
of
appeals
discusses
the
meager
case
authority,
in
the
first
paragraph
on
that
page,
that
existed
about
efforts
to
try
to
include
liquidated
damages
provisions
before
they
were
authorized
by
regulation.
the
commission
took
the
position
in
this
litigation
that
those
cases
striking
down
those
efforts
to
have
them
solely
as
a
creature
of
tariff
were
correctly
decided.
they
were...
only
one
of
the
district
court
decisions
was
reported,
but
that
was
all
there
was
on
the
subject.
the
great
controversy
that
took
place
over
a
period
of
3
years
in
the
late
eighties
would
have
been
rather
meaningless
if
carriers
had
been
free
to
prescribe
this
for
themselves
in
their
tariff
filings
without
authorization
from
the
commission.
that's
what
the
controversy
in
the
rulemaking
was
about.
