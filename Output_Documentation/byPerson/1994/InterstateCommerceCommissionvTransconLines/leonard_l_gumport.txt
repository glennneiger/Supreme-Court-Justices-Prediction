mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
concedes
in
its
brief
in
this
court
that
the
loss
of
discount
tariff
provision
is
lawful.
the
government
also
concedes
in
its
brief
in
this
court
that
the
regulations
still
do
not
create
a
defense
to
payment
of
the
filed
rate
assertable
by
shippers.
this
is
therefore
a
simple
case,
because
congress
has
explicitly
addressed
the
issue
in
the
statute.
it's
much
easier
than
maislin.
the
carrier,
unless
and
until
this
tariff
is
rendered
ineffective,
set
aside,
or
suspended,
must,
under
pain
of
civil
and
criminal
penalties,
enforce
the
concededly
lawful
loss
of
discount
tariff
provision.
the
government's
position
to
the
contrary
is
contradicted
by
the
express
language
of
the
statute,
it's
contradicted
by
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
it's
contradicted
by
the
decisions
of
this
court
from
the
1907
texas
abilene
decision
through
this
court's
1994
decision
last
term
in
mci
telecommunications,
and
it's
contradicted
by
the
icc's
own
interpretation
of
its
credit
regulations.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
justice
ginsburg,
if
one
could
reasonably
do
that,
that
would
be
right,
but
in
this
case
it
was
impossible
to
do
that,
and
there's
at
least
four
reasons
why
it's
impossible.
first
of
all,
the
tariff
is
unambiguous.
there's
no
dispute
that
under
the
express
terms
of
the
tariff
a
shipper
is
not
entitled
to
the
discount
unless
it
pays
the
tariff
charge
within
90
days,
and
only
then...
only
then
is
it
entitled
to
the
discount,
and
when
certain
shipper
amici
tried
to
argue
to
the
contrary,
they
had
to
change
the
language
of
the
tariff
to
make
that
argument.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
there
are
several
reasons,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
it's
contrary
to
this
court's
decision
in
davis
v.
portland
seed,
where
a
carrier
had
filed
a
tariff
that
contained
a
higher
rate
for
the
shorter
route
than
for
the
longer
route,
and
the
tariff
was
arguably
unlawful
on
its
face.
it
was
contrary
to
the
express
provisions
of
the
statute,
and
this
court
said,
it
doesn't
matter,
it's
the
filed
rate,
and
unless
and
until
the
icc
suspends
or
sets
it
aside--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--yes,
your--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--your
honor,
first
of
all
the
icc
could
retroactively
reject
that
kind
of
tariff,
it
could
reject
it,
it
could
suspend
it,
and
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
your
honor,
let's
take
your
hypothetical,
precisely
your
hypothetical.
if
that
was
executed
and
somebody
was
killed
under
the
terms
of
the
tariff
provision,
there
would
be
criminal
penalties
for
doing
that,
and
indeed,
in
maislin,
in
the
maislin
decision--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--yes.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
your
honor,
it's--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--your
honor,
it's
a
question
of
remedy,
because
in
the
maislin
case
there
was
no
question,
and
the
court
pointed
out
in
footnote
12
of
its
decision
that
if
the
carrier
was
lying
to
shippers
about
what
it's
real
rates
were,
it
was
a
crime,
and
nevertheless
in
maislin
the
court
held
that
the
icc
could
not
have
a
valid
policy
which
created
a
remedy
that
operated
to
prevent
the
carrier
from
enforcing
its
filed
rate.
and
in
this
case
we
don't
dispute
that
the
icc
has
a
remedy.
the
icc
could
criminally
prosecute
people
who
knowingly
extended
credit
in
violation
of
its
regulations.
we
don't
dispute
that.
what
the--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--your
honor,
let
me--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--we
disagree,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
regulations
of
the
icc
that
says
you
can't
have
a
loss
of
discount
tariff
provision
except
under
our
credit
regulations.
there's
nothing
in
those
regulations
that
say
that,
nothing
at
all.
let
me
return
to
your
earlier
question.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
your
honor,
in
1985,
the
icc
authorized
the
filing
of
tariffs
giving
discounts
for
early
payment,
and
in
that
1985
regulatory
decision
they
said,
we're
not
sure
you
can
do
this,
but
we're
now
specifically
authorizing
you
to
do
it.
this
denial
of
discount,
i
would
submit,
is
no
different,
so
that--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--your
honor,
i
don't
know.
let
me
return
to
your
question
as
to
whether
there
are
two
filed
rates.
there's
only
one
filed
rate.
the
icc,
in
its
1988
decision
authorizing
the
filing
of
loss
of
discount
tariff
provisions,
said
that
under
the
filed
rate
doctrine
the
carrier
must
enforce
the
loss
of
discount
tariff
provision.
in
the
trial
court,
before
judge
hill
heard
the
issue
that
he
disposed
of
by
summary
judgment,
he
specifically
asked
the
icc's
counsel
whether
it
agreed
that
the
loss
of
discount
tariff
provision,
which
is
a
part
of
the
rules
tariff,
whether
the
icc
agreed
that
the
rules
tariffs
were
a
part
of
the
carrier's
filed
rate
within
the
meaning
of
maislin,
and
the
icc's
counsel
responded,
yes,
i
don't
take
issue
with
that.
the
icc
also
put
in
a
declaration
from
a
tariff
expert,
a
mr.
manning,
on
november
8,
1991,
in
support
of
its
cross
motion
for
summary
judgment,
and
he
said
in
his
declaration
that
transcon's
tcon
625,
which
is
the
discount
tariff,
is
governed
by
transcon's
tcon
103,
which
is
the
rules
tariff,
in
which
the
loss
of
discount
tariff
provision
appears.
so
there
is
no
dispute,
and
there
was
no
dispute
in
the
trial
court,
and
the
evidence
was
only
on
one
side
on
this
issue,
that
this
loss
of
discount
tariff
provision
governs
the
rate.
it
sets
the
rate.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
it's
a
rate.
it
doesn't
matter
what
it's
called,
your
honor,
it's
a
rate,
and
even
if
it
was
unlawful--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--your
honor,
i
think
arguments
could
be
made
either
way.
my
position
would
be
it's
a
liquidated
damages
provision,
but
i
think
it's
a
rate.
that's
the
important
thing.
it
is
a
rate.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
excuse
me?
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
my
answer
is,
it
doesn't
matter,
but
my
answer...
when
put
to
the
test
of
how
would
you
characterize
it,
i
would
say
it's
a
liquidated
damages
provision.
i
would
also
say,
it
doesn't
matter,
because
it
is
a
rate,
and
the
issue
before
this
court
is
the
remedy,
and
congress
has
said
what
the
remedy
should
be.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
but
your
honor,
the
question
isn't
whether
the
regulations
were
violated.
the
question
is,
what
is
the
remedy
for
the
violation
of
the
regulations?
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
this
statute's
language
says
one
important
thing
about
what's
to
be
in
the
regulations.
it
says
that
the
regulations
are
to
be
regulations
"preventing
discrimination"
and
that--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--"#
and
preventing
discrimination".
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
your
honor,
there's
no
question
that
it's
governing
the
payment,
but
the
question
is,
what
is
the
remedy,
and
the
statutory
language
tells
us
not
only
that
they
govern
payment
but
that
they
are
to
be
regulations
"preventing
discrimination",
and
preventing
discrimination
is
a
judicially
defined
term.
it
was
judicially
defined
in
this
court's
texas
&
pacific
railway
company
decision,
v.
abilene
cotton,
in
1907
before
these...
this
statute
was
enacted,
and
in
that
case,
which
was
quoted
with
approval
in
the
mci
case--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--they
are
unlawful
insofar
as
they
are
applied
to
create
a
judicial
injunction
preventing
the
carrier
from
performing
its
statutory
duty
to
collect
the
filed
rate,
and
that's
because,
just
as
in
maislin,
there
was
a
broad
grant
of
power
to
the
commission
to
prohibit
unreasonable
practices.
here
we
have
a
statute
that
uses
the
words,
icc
cannot
provide
for
in
its
regulations
is
the
remedy
of
directing
the
carrier
not
to
adhere
to
its
tariff
rate.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
i
don't
just
place
all
that
weight
on
those
two
words,
which
have
been
defined...
were
defined
by
this
court
before
those
words
were
put
in
the
statute,
and
the
definition
was
reaffirmed.
i
also
place
weight
on
the
absolutely
clear
legislative
history,
which
confirms
that
congress
meant
what
it
said.
the
legislative
history,
which
was
explained
by
this
court
in
the
commercial
metals
case,
was
that
the
credit
rules
of
the
commission
serve
three
basic
purposes.
one
is,
they
exist
for
the
benefit
of
the
carrier,
and
the
icc
in
its
brief
in
this
court
doesn't
deny
that,
but
here
it's
seeking
to
enforce
the
credit
rules
for
the
benefit
of
the
shipper,
and
the
credit
rules
are
also
to
serve
the
additional
two
purposes
of
preventing
discrimination,
which
this
court
has
always
held,
right
through
mci,
last
term...
that
there
is
an
indissoluble
unity.
that's...
those
are
the
words
of
the
court
in
the
texas
&
pacific
case,
those
are
the
words
of
the
court
in
mci
telecommunications,
that
there's
an
indissoluble
unity
between
a
carrier's
duty
to
adhere
to
the
filed
rate
and
the
statutory
goal
of
preventing
discrimination.
in
addition,
the
court
also
explained
in
commercial
metals
that
the
other
purpose
of
the
credit
rules
is
to
protect
the
working...
the
capital
structure
of
the
carrier,
yet
here,
the
credit
rules
are
to
be
applied
to
prevent
the
carrier
from
recovering
funds
that
it
needs
to
pay
its
creditors.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
because
under
chevron,
your
honor,
the
commission
has
no
discretion
to
interpret
its
regulations
when
congress
has
specifically
addressed
the
issue,
and
in
this
statute,
which
uses
the
words,
"preventing
discrimination",
which
is
a
judicially
defined
term--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--your
honor,
i
can
only...
i
can
only
refer--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--this
case
is
a
far
more
compelling
case
than
maislin.
maislin
involved
a
statute
that
was
unqualified.
the
commission
has
the
power
to
prevent
unreasonable
practices,
and
this
court
said
if
a
carrier
commits
an
unreasonable
practice
the
commission
can
criminally
prosecute
the
carrier,
but
what
the
commission
can't
do
because
of
the
utterly
central
filed
rate
provisions
which
are
subject
to
civil
and
criminal
penalties
for
disobedience
to,
what
it
can't
do
is
create
basically
a
agency-made
injunction
against
a
carrier's
enforcing
the
filed
rate.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
invalid
as
applied,
not
on
their
face.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
absolutely.
the
historical
application
of
the
credit
rules,
and
the
case
law
reflects
this,
is
suing
a
carrier
prospectively
to
not
extend
credit
to
shippers
who
won't
pay
the
carrier's
filed
rate,
because
these
regulations--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--absolutely
not,
justice
stevens.
other
remedies
include
the
right
to
award
reparations
to
any
shipper
who
can
show
that
the
bureau
rate
as
applied
is
unreasonable--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--absolutely.
that's
exactly
it.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
your
honor,
that's
not--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--that's
not
accurate,
your
honor.
my
client
is
the
bankruptcy
estate
of
transcon
lines.
transcon
lines
shipped...
transcon
lines'
bankruptcy
estate
shipped
no
freight.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
i'm...
no,
i
am
not,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
my
position
is,
and
i
concede
transcon
shipped
freight
before
its
bankruptcy.
it
shipped
no
freight
after
its
bankruptcy.
i
concede
that
when--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--as
to
transcon,
there
are
multiple
remedies.
first,
there
is
an
award
of
reparations,
and
the
icc
says
in
its
brief
in
this
court
that
those
can't
be
awarded,
but
it
said
in
its
1988
decision
reparations
can
be
awarded
if
the
bureau
rate
is
unreasonable.
in
addition--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--well,
reparations,
reparations
are
to
the
extent
that
the
rate
being
imposed
is
unlawful,
reparations
can
be
awarded.
if
this
is
an
unlawful
rate,
let
the
commission
say
so.
it's
simply
not
doing
its
job
of
saying
what
the
rate
should
be.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
okay.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
it
can
impose
civil
and
criminal
penalties
on
everyone
who
knowingly
participated
in
those
violations.
it
can
do
that,
and
on
transcon
as
well.
what
it
can't
do--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--your
honor--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--the
penalties
are
a
per-day
penalty.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
the
penalties
are
a
per-day
penalty,
and
it's...
i--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
whether
it
could
under
the
law.
i
think
that...
i
think
one
thing
i
would
emphasize
on
that
is,
that...
it
just
doesn't
matter
from
the
standpoint
of
my
case.
i
don't...
i
don't
care
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
it's
not,
your
honor,
because
under
the
interstate
commerce
act
so
long
as
the
rate
is
in
effect
there
is
a
civil
and
criminal
duty
to
comply,
and
the
one
remedy
that
they're
asking
for
is
what
the
statute
commands
they
can't
have.
they
can
fine
transcon.
they
can
criminally
prosecute
the
people
who
knowingly
participated
in
this--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--your
honor,
i
don't...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
ultimate
sanction
of
the
government
for
people
who
violate
its
rules
is
to
throw
them
in
jail,
and
the
people
who
used
to
run
transcon
are
all
still
around
running
another
trucking
company,
and
it
would
have
a
salutary
effect
on
the
trucking
industry,
if
the
icc
really
wants
to
stop,
make
people
comply
with
their
regulations,
to
go
out
and
prosecute
them.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
your
honor,
that's...
first
of
all,
the
regulations
as
interpreted
by
the
icc
only
apply
to
the
following
situation,
and
this
is
reflected
in
the
decisions:
a
trustee
or
somebody
else
sends
out
a
whole
slew
of
bills
in
an
envelope
and
says,
unless
you
pay
these
right
away
within
the
90-day
time
period,
i'm
going
to
deny
you
the
discount
and
impose
the
higher
bureau
rate.
there's
no
evidence
in
the
record,
and
in
fact
it's
the
case
that
that
was
never
done
in
the
transcon
case.
all
that
happened
in
transcon
was,
transcon
shipped
freight
before
it
went
under,
it
went
into
bankruptcy,
and
more
than
90
days
later,
rate
auditors
were
hired,
and
people
were
sued
saying,
you
didn't
pay
the
bills
for
the
freight
within
90
days,
and
therefore
the...
by
the
unequivocal
terms
of
transcon's
tariff,
you
must
pay
the
bureau
rate,
which--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--your
honor,
if
i
was
violating
the
credit
regulations,
i
could
go
to
jail,
and
if
the
rate
imposed
is
an
unlawful
rate,
and
the
government
concedes
it
is
not
an
unlawful
rate,
the
icc
could
say,
this
is
just
too
high.
it's
unlawful.
you
can't
collect
this
money.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
because
that
argument
proves
too
much,
justice
scalia.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
under
that
argument,
the
icc
could
promulgate
regulations
just
like
it
issued
a
negotiated
rates
policy
in
maislin
saying
no
carrier
shall
collect
its
filed
rate,
period,
and
maislin
should
have
come
out
the
other
way.
it
should
have--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--come
out
the
other
way.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
i
would
be
out
of
luck.
i
couldn't
be
here.
what's
interesting,
your
honor--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--your
honor,
it
would
be...
that
tariff
would
be
invalidated
by
the
court
of
appeals
on
hobbs
act
review
under
then-judge
scalia's
decision
in
regular
common
carrier
conference
v.
united
states
in
1986,
where
the
d.c.
circuit
wrote,
you
can't
have
a
tariff
that
really
doesn't
allow
the
shipper
and
the
carrier
to
figure
out
what
rate
will
really
apply.
and
the
commission
was
aware
of
that
decision
at
the
time
it
issued
its
decision
approving
these
credit
regulations.
it
didn't
want,
it
knew
that
it
couldn't
have
a
tariff
that
had
all
these
discretionary
provisions
in
it.
that's
why
it
doesn't
want
to
suspend
this
tariff,
because
there's
lots
of
these
out
there.
the
carriers
are
using
them.
this
isn't
the
only
loss
of
discount
tariff
that's
like
this.
the
commission
is
in
here
not
because
it
wants
to
stop
carriers
from
disobeying
its
credit
regulations,
because
there's
lots
of
other--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--correct.
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
and
i'm
saying
they
can
enforce
that
any
way
they
want
to,
except
in
one
way,
and
that
is
to
sue
the
carrier
to
prevent
it
from
performing
its
statutory
duty
to
charge
and
collect
its
filed
rate
unless
and
until--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--your
honor,
i
would
disagree,
because
the
court
has
defined
discrimination
as
being
per
se
occurring
when
a
carrier
is
disregarding
its
tariff
rate.
that
is
the
teaching
of
the
filed
rate
doctrine
from
texas
&
pacific
railroad
v.
abilene
cotton
through
mci
telecommunications.
the
rule
of
this
court
has
always
been,
it
is
discriminatory
when
a
carrier
departs
from
its
filed
rate
unless
and
until
the
icc
sets
it
aside,
and
in
your
hypothetical,
justice
breyer,
the
commission
could
prosecute
people
for
wilfully
disobeying
the
credit
regulations.
it
could
also
sue
a
carrier
prospectively
saying,
you've
got
to
send
out
these
reminder
notices,
you
have
to
let
people
know,
and
it
could
get
contempt
penalties
for
violation
of
that
injunction.
what
it
couldn't
do
is
to
say,
you
violated
our
credit
regulations.
therefore,
even
though
we've
done
nothing
with
your
tariff,
even
though
we
concede
that
your
tariff
is
lawful,
even
though
the
statutory
provisions
of
the
act
say
you
must
charge
and
collect
your
tariff
provision
and
you
shall
go
to
jail
if
you
disregard
it,
we
still
want
an
injunction
against
you
stopping
you
from
doing
what
the
statute
commands.
this
is
really
a
case
about
remedy.
it's
not
about--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--it
would
make
no
difference,
your
honor,
under
davis
v.
portland
seed.
it
would
make
no
difference.
a
tariff
can
be
blatantly
unlawful
on
its
face,
and
unless
and
until
the
icc
suspends
it,
rejects
it,
cancels
it,
does
something
like
that,
the
carrier
must
comply.
now,
i
think,
to
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
hypothetical,
if
i
was
the
trustee
and
i
found
that
there
were
some
tariffs
on
file
saying
go
out
and
kill
people,
i
would
petition
the
icc
to
strike
that
tariff.
that's
what
would
happen.
but
i
would
have
been
duty
bound
to
enforce
it,
unless
and
until
they
set
it
aside.
i'd
immediately
start
an
enforcement
proceeding.
but
this
is
a
case
about
remedy,
and
the
one
remedy
that
they
cannot
have
under--
mr.
leonard
l.
gumport
--thank
you.
i
can
appreciate
those
remarks.
but
it
is
a
case
about
remedy,
and
the
one
remedy
that
they
cannot
have
is
an
injunction
to
set...
directing
a
carrier
permanently
to
disregard
a
filed
rate,
and
mr.
chief
justice,
those
words,
"preventing
discrimination",
as
construed
by
this
court
are
controlling.
in
maislin,
there
weren't
those
words
in
the
statute,
and
the
court
still
found
that
the
remedy
could
not
be
created
that
would
force
the
carrier
to
depart
from
its
filed
rate.
thank
you
very
much.
