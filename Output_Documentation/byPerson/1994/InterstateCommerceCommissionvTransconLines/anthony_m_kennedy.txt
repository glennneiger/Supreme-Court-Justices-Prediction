justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
could
the
trustee,
in
an
action
brought
by
the
shipper,
raise
this
as
a
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
was
going
to
ask
you,
do
you
have
a
position
as
to
whether
or
not
the
defense
is
available
in
the
action
itself?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
it's
an
invalid
rate,
then
under
our
k
mart
line
of...
under
the
k
mart
case,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
it's
just
a
nonenforceable
rate
in
the
court,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
would
almost
have
to
be
the
premise
if
you're
to
prevail
here.
i'm
not
quite
sure
why
there
should
be
a
difference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
gumport,
can
i
just
clarify
one
thing?
are
you
contending
that
the
credit
regulations
are
invalid?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--let
me
just...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
you're
not
contending
the
regulations
are
invalid,
merely
the
particular
remedy
is
not
authorized
by
the
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
true?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
just
shorten
it
a
little.
are
you
contending
that
you
complied
with
the
credit
regulations
in
all
respects?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
first
case
i
have
to
announce
for
the
court
is
interstate
commerce
commission
versus
transcom.
this
is
another
in
a
series
of
recent
cases
from
the
court
involving
the
filed
rate
doctrine.
interstate
commerce
act
requires
motor
carriers
to
file
rates
applicable
to
shippers
and
these
rates
maybe
collected
even
if
the
shipper
and
the
carrier
later
agree
upon
some
lesser
amount.
in
maislin
industries
versus
primary
steel
decided
in
1990.
we
held
that
the
icc
could
not
interpret
the
bar
on
unreasonable
practices
to
prevent
carriers
from
suing
for
the
filed-rate.
we
reason
that
this
would
undermine
the
filed-rate
doctrine.
in
the
case
before
as
a
trucking
company
now
in
bankruptcy
seeks
through
its
bankruptcy
trustee
to
collect
liquidateddamages
from
its
former
customers.
the
icc
soon
joined
these
collections
because
the
carrier
had
not
complied
the
certain
icc
credit
regulations.
the
original
bills
did
not
advise
the
penalty
for
late
payment.
revised
bills
were
not
issued
within
90
days
and
the
damages
were
being
applied
in
the
aggregate
instead
of
in
separate
bills.
all
of
these
violations
were
in
contravention
of
the
regulations
of
the
icc.
the
bankruptcy
trustee
defended
against
the
injunction
of
the
icc
sought
and
it
sided
maislin.
the
district
court
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
with
the
trustee
that
maislin
applied.
we
remanded
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
an
intervening
decision
of
this
court
that
intervening
decision
was
ryder
versus
cooper.
the
court
of
appeals
adhered
to
its
earlier
decision,
we
again
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
the
interstate
commerce
commission
can
pursue
those
remedies
necessary
to
prevent
the
carrier
from
violation
as
regulations.
injunctive
remedy
sought
here
appears
to
the
icc
and
to
us
necessary
to
the
effective
enforcement
of
the
regulations.
remedy
serves
to
protect
the
regulations
intended
beneficiary,
so
our
conclusion
follows
from
our
1982
decision
in
southern
pacific
company
versus
commercial
metals
and
itâ€™s
that
decision
not
the
maislin
case
that
is
the
applicable
president
here.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
is
accordingly
reversed
and
the
case
is
remanded
and
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
