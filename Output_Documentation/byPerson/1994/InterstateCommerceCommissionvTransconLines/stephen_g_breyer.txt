justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
curious
abut
the
statute.
isn't
there
a
statute
here?
i
may
not
understand
it
correctly,
but
if
i
do,
i
thought
that
the...
there
is
a
statute
that
governs
the
tariff,
and
it
says
that
you
can't
have
a
tariff
that
allows
a
person
credit,
except
"under
regulations
of
the
commission",
so
the
statute
seems
to
say
the
only
reason
you
could
have
this
provision
in
the
tariff
is
because
you
will
file,
follow,
regulations
of
the
commission.
and
now
i
take
it
what
the
commission
said
is,
you
did
follow
regulations
of
the
commission
when
you
put
that
in,
you
did
follow
regulations
of
the
commission
when
you
accepted
the
freight
on
credit,
but
you
did
not
follow
the
regulations
of
the
commission
when
you
sought
damages,
because
you
can't
seek
damages
aggregate,
and
you
have
to
present
your
bill
within
7
days,
or
something
like
that,
under
the
regulations
of
the
commission.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know.
i'm
asking
about
the
statute.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
difference
between
this
and
the
other
cases,
because
here
there
is
a
statute
that
specifically
governs.
now,
maybe
it
doesn't.
that's
what
i'm
asking,
though.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
maybe
i
don't
have
it
right.
mine
says,
"governing
the
payment
for
transportation
and
service
and--
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
but
i
take
it
this
was
governing
the
payment
for
transportation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
mean
their
regulations
are
unlawful
because
they
don't
deal
with
discrimination?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
still
curious
about...
go
back
to
the
statute
for
one
second.
regulations
of
the
commission
governing
payment
for
transportation
and
service
and,
you
say,
preventing
discrimination.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
fine.
the
commission
says
we
want
notice
given
of
these
things
because
otherwise
big
shippers
with
big
lawyers
know
and
little
shippers
with
little
lawyers
don't.
we
want
to
have
no
aggregate,
because
we
think
otherwise
the
people
who
are
customers
of
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy
will
have
to
pay,
the
other
guys
won't.
we
want
to
be
certain,
whatever
the
third
one
was,
that
you
don't
give,
years
later,
notice,
because
we
don't
want
them
picking
and
choosing,
all
there
to
stop
discrimination
as
well
as
transportation.
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
the
filed
rate
that
discriminates,
because
it
does
discriminate,
since
it
violates
these
regs.
