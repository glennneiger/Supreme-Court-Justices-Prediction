mr.
wallace,
i'm
not
sure
i
quite
understand
what
the
government's
position
is
regarding
provisions
that
are
in
rate
filings
because
they
are
required
to
be
there
by
these
regulations.
is
it
your
position
that
somehow
they
do
not
enjoy
the
protections
that
other
provisions
of
the
rates
enjoy?
justice
antonin
scalia
aren't
there
a
number
of
things
that
might
be
optionally
included
in
rates
but
do
not
have
to
be
included
in
rates?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
that's
because
of
enforcement
discretion,
because
you
could
move
against
some
and
not
against
others?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
for
the
purpose
of
a
defense
by
the
shipper,
isn't
that
right--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
for
purposes
of
suit
by
somebody
else.
it
seems
to
me
it
just
can't
be
that
the
interstate
commerce
act
means
anything
that
you
put...
you
know,
any
provision
you
put
in
your
rate
filing
has
to
be
executable.
i
mean,
suppose
you
say,
you
know,
any
shipper
who
doesn't
pay
within
90
days,
the
ceo
shall
be
shot.
you're
going
to
say,
well,
there
it
is,
it's
in
the
filed
rate,
the
icc
didn't
get
around
to
striking
it
down,
so
we
have
to
go
ahead
and
perform
it.
i
mean,
obviously
it's
unlawful
and
you
can't
perform
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
until
it
did
that,
you
are
entitled
to
go
ahead
and
execute
the
contract,
in
fact
obliged
to,
as
you'd
say,
under--
justice
antonin
scalia
--how
can
you
have
criminal
penalties
for
complying
with
federal
law?
you're
telling
me
that
you're
obliged
to
perform
that
contract
by
the
legislation--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
it's
there
in
the
rate
and
it
hasn't
been
set
aside
by
the
icc?
justice
antonin
scalia
surely...
i
mean,
i
think
the
law
against
murder
is
just
a
state
law,
and
this
is
federal
law,
which
supersedes
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
consider
it
a
liquidated
damages
provision.
it's
just
a
rate.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
indulge
me.
i
mean,
suppose
i
think
it
makes
a
difference
what
it's
called.
is
it
liquidated
damages
or
is
it
just
a
different
rate?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gumport,
why
shouldn't
it
be
considered
impliedly
part
of
any
rate
whatever
the
commission's
regulations
demand
with
regard
to
that
rate?
why
shouldn't
it
simply
be
considered
part
of
the
filed
rate?
even
if
you
leave
it
out
it's
implied
that,
of
course,
the
other
conditions
required
by
the
commission's
regulations
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
a
hard
man,
mr.
gumport.
[laughter]
you
better
seek
counsel
before
you
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
seem
to
make
much
sense.
