mr.
wallace,
could
you
clarify
for
me
what
this...
what
you've
been
calling
the
liquidated
damages
which
the
respondents
call
the
bureau
rate,
when,
other
than
in
the
context
of
liquidated
damages
for
failure
to
pay
on
time,
would
this
bureau
rate
apply,
and
in
connection
with
that,
what
rate
would
apply
to
someone
who
is
shipping
these
same
goods
on
these
same
routes
who
pays
on
delivery,
who
doesn't
get
credit
terms?
that
wouldn't
be
the
bureau
rate,
would
it?
it
would
be
some--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
wouldn't...
i'm
positing
no
delay
in
payment.
wouldn't
there
be
something
even
more
favorable
than
the
discounted
rate?
the
shipper
who
pays
on
delivery,
who's
not
asking
even
for
30
days,
is
that
also--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
does
the
bureau
rate...
it
certainly
doesn't
apply
to
one
who
pays
promptly.
does
it
apply
to
anything
other
than
this
liquid...
as
a
liquidated
damage--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
did
that
occur
in
the
ninth
circuit
after
reargument
and
fresh
briefing,
or
when
the
response
to
reiter--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
reargued
before
the
same...
not
reargued,
just
rebriefed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
if
you
read
the
filed
rate
as
the
discounted
rate,
and
the
liquidated...
what
you
call
the
bureau
rate,
what
they
call
the
liquidated
damage
provision,
if
you
read
that
as
simply
a
credit
term,
not...
the
filed
rate,
the
rate
is
the
discounted
rate.
then,
if
you
don't
pay
up
on
time
there's
this
liquidated
damage
provision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
shouldn't
the
commission's
own
rules
be
treated
as
a
supplement
to
the
tariff,
since
admittedly
you
can
have
this
higher
rate,
bureau
rate,
liquidated
damage
rate,
you
can
have
it
only
by
virtue
of
the
credit
provisions,
so
why
not
say,
as
a
supplement
to
this
tariff,
we
read
in
the
icc
conditions,
forgetting
the
liquidated
damages,
put
it
in
the
bill,
90
days
passes,
send
them
another
notice...
why
shouldn't
those
icc
credit
regulations
in
effect
be
treated
as
a
supplement
to
the
tariff?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here
there
is
another
rate,
and
that
does
make
it
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
ask
you
just
to
clarify
this
point,
which
i
think
is
clear,
but
if
it's
not,
tell
me.
the
only
reason
that
you
can
have
this
two-track
system,
the
discounted
rate
which
applies
originally
and
the
liquidated
damage
rate,
the
only
reason
you
can
have
that
liquidated
damage
rate
is
because
of
the
icc's
credit
regulations.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
do
you
get
the
authority
to
put
in
the
two-track
system,
other
than
the
credit
regulations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
please
clarify
for
me,
then,
the
extent
to
which
you
disagree
with
mr.
wallace,
who
said
this
was
not
possible
until
the
eighties
rulemaking.
until
then,
you
got
the
interest
for
late
payment,
it
was
only
that
rulemaking
that
brought
in
the
credit
regulations,
and
one
way
of
calculating
the
liquidated
damages
was
having
this
additional
tariff.
is
it
true
that
you
had
these
two-track
systems,
the
discounted
rate
and
the
higher
rate,
before
there
were
any
credit
regulations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
know
that
you've
answered
my
question.
did
you...
were
there
these
two-track
tariff
systems
before
the
eighties
rulemaking?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
it's
both.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
credit
regulations
said
one
way
of
calculating
liquid
damages
is
what
you
have
put
in
as
the
bureau
rate,
and
you
have
followed
that
way
of
calculating
liquidated
damages,
so
was
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
that
it's
both?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let's
see
about
the
"if".
we--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we...
it's
conceded
that
the
invoices
when
they
were
sent
out
did
not
have
the
credit
terms.
it's
conceded
that
the
90-day
notice
was
not
sent
out.
okay.
let's
take
those
violations,
transcon
now
in
bankruptcy
court.
what
remedies
does
the
icc
have
for
its
admittedly
valid
credit
regulations?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
only
one
who's
here
at
the
moment
is
the
trustee,
so
the
icc
practically...
practically,
what
can
the
icc
do
to
say,
here's
our
credit
regulations
plainly
violated,
and
we
want
to
do
something
that
will
realistically
enforce
these
rules?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
trustee,
because
of
the
bill...
they
were
sent
out
with
average
balances
instead
of
aggregating,
instead
of
making
a
separate--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
the
trustee
gets
the
benefit
of
the
sweep
that
transcon
did,
it
has
this
higher
rate,
but
it's
not
saddled
with
any
of
the,
even
going
to
jail,
that
the
transcon
people
would
have
had.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
transcon
had
put
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--no,
no,
no,
that's--
--just
copied
into
its
tariff
the
icc's
credit
regulations,
then
you
would
lose,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
the
credit
regulations
were
written
into
the
statute.
you
already
told
me
if
they
were
written
into
the
tariff
you'd
be...
you'd
have
no
case.
suppose
they
were
written
into
the
statute
as
distinguished
from
being
regulations,
would
that
make
a
difference?
