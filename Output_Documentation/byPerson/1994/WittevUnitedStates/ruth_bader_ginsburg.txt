justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
punishment,
what
is
his
exposure?
would
you
explain
that...
if
there's
one
charge
or
two
charges
in
the
first
trial,
it's
going
to
end
up
with
the
same
range.
what
is
the
additional
exposure
in
terms
of
length
of
incarceration
as
a
consequence
of
the
second
prosecution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
sentences
are
concurrent--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--let's
forget
the
downward
departure.
leave
it
out
of
it.
tell
me
the
difference
in
the
time
served
among
these
three:
1)
we
have
an
indictment
for
both
crimes,
2)
we
have
an
indictment
only
for
one,
and
the
other
crime
is
considered
relevant
conduct,
3)
we
have
an
indictment
for
one,
the
other
considered
relevant
conduct,
but
a
second
prosecution
for
the
second
crime.
are
you
telling
me
that
the
total
numbers
will
differ
in
that
third...
the
total
incarceration
period
will
differ?
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
that's
a
different
answer
than
the
one
i
thought
you
gave.
i
asked
you...
i
gave
you
three
situations.
now
i'll
just
give
you
two.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
trial,
two
charges,
guilty
of
both,
sentenced.
one
trial,
one
charge
plus
relevant
conduct.
second
trial,
one
charge.
is
the
total
exposure,
assuming
the
sentences
are
going
to
run
concurrently
and
that
you
get
credit
in
the
second
case
for
the
time
that
you
served
earlier,
is
there
any
difference
in
the
time
that
this
person
can
be
made
to
serve
between
consecutive
trials,
one
on
the
two
charges,
or
one
trial
on
both
charges?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
range
any
different?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
exposure
is
the
same
whether
it's
one
trial
on
two
charges
or
consecutive
trials
each
on
one
of
the
charges.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
only
because
of
the
departure
for...
because
of
cooperation
in
the
first
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no
cooperation
as
to
the
second
charge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
i
didn't
understand
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
if
in
the
first
trial
the
cocaine
is
simply
relevant
conduct,
how
could
it
count
as
two
strikes?
wouldn't
you
have
to
bring
the
second
prosecution
to
make
it
a
second
strike?
