mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
cases
have
always
permitted
consideration
at
sentencing
of
conduct
that
is
not
part
of
the
offense
of
conviction,
whether
or
not
that
conduct
has
led
to
other
convictions,
precisely
because
the
sentence
imposed
at
any
given
proceeding
constitutes
punishment
only
for
the
offense
that
is
actually
before
the
court
in
that
proceeding.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
in
response
to
the
first
question,
we
think
that,
although
there
is
some
slight
doubt
on
it,
we
think
the
issues
are
squarely
presented.
the
only
doubt
would
arise
if
you
could
not
reach
the
double
jeopardy
question
until
the
sentencing
stage
of
the
second
trial.
that
would
depend
on
the
determination
that
conviction
could
be
had
in
the
second
proceeding
without...
as
long
as
there
was
no
sentence,
there
would
be
no
jeopardy
problem.
that
seems
to
us
somewhat
inconsistent
with
the
court's
decision
in
ball
v.
united
states,
and
also
there's
another
case
called
woodward,
i
believe,
where
the
court
took
notice
of
the
$50
special
assessments
that
are
required
under
federal
law,
and
said
that
those
were
enough
to
prevent
two
sentences
from
being
completely
concurrent.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
there
are
a
variety
of
interesting
and
difficult
questions
raised
by
the
notion
of
what
the
proper
sentence
would
be
at
the
second
proceeding.
i
don't
think
it's
necessary...
it
is
not
why
we
prosecuted
the
crimes
separately
that
we
intended
additional
punishment.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
assuming
no
special
assessments?
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
an
interesting
and
difficult
question
that
has
not
been
reached.
our
position
would
be
that--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
my
position
on
behalf
of
the
government
ought
to
be
that
it
is
not
necessarily
punishment
for
the
second
offense
to
be
convicted
for,
but
i
think
in
all
candidness
that
would
be
a
very
difficult
position
to
maintain
if
we
were
forced
to
maintain
it,
so--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--the
reason--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
suppose
there
are
many
possibilities.
that's
not
what
happened
here,
and
i
should--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
in
general
we
might
be
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
a
three-time-loser
statute
even
if
we
brought
one
prosecution,
but
what
happened
here
is
that
we
had
two
different...
what
the
government
viewed
and
still
views
as
two
very
different
offenses.
they
involved
different
people.
mr.
witte
was
a
common
conspirator
in
the
two.
that's
about
the
only
thing
the
two
had
in
common.
now,
we
had
in
jail
at
the
time
mr.
witte
and
his
codefendant
in
the
first
case.
we
chose
to
go
ahead
and
prosecute
that
case,
which
seems
to
me
the
right
answer
when
we
have
people
in
jail.
we
did
not
prosecute
the
cocaine
conspiracy
because
his
coconspirator
was
at
large
for
most
of
this
period,
and
the
investigation
was
not
yet
completed.
once
we
picked
up
the
coconspirator,
we
promptly
charged
the
second
conspiracy,
the
cocaine
conspiracy,
and
proceeded
to
try
that.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
oh,
certainly,
if
it's
only
in
the
first
prosecution
as
relevant
conduct.
i
understood
the
question
to
be...
then
i
misunderstood
the
question.
i'm
sorry.
if
we
had
brought
several
charges,
several
counts
in
the
first
indictment,
it
seems
to
me
we
might
very
well
be
able
to
impose
a
recidivist
enhancement
on
the
fourth
one
of
conviction,
but
if
it's
just
counted
as
relevant
conduct,
then
there's
certainly
no
question
about
it,
we
would
have
to
bring
a
second
prosecution,
and
that
really
gets
to
the
point,
which
is
that
under
all
of
this
court's
cases
there's
always
been
quite
a
clear
distinction
between
conviction
for
an
offense
and
a
sentence
imposed
after
that
conviction,
and
other--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
it
might
have
been
possible
to
proceed
in
this
trial.
it
would
have
complicated
the
marijuana
trial
quite
considerably,
and
it
would
have
required
us
to
put
on
all
the
cocaine
evidence
in
two
trials,
both...
first
at
mr.
witte's
trial
and
then
at
the
trial
of
his
coconspirator.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
and
somewhat
more,
yes.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
first
of
all,
the
investigation
had
not
been
completed,
so
it
was
not
at
the
time
a
foregone
conclusion
that
there
would
not
have
been
additional
conduct
discovered--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
you
mean
having
had
the
judge
already
impose
the
sentence
that
he
did?
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the
government
is
entitled,
it
always
has
been
entitled
to
bring
those
two
prosecutions.
as
it
prosecutes
for--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--because
the
government
was
going
to
prosecute
the
other
coconspirator
in
any
event,
we
were
entitled
to
seek
a
second
conviction
against
mr.
witte
on
the--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
believe
the
government
felt
that
we
were
entitled
to
get
the
conviction
on
the
record
as
a
conviction.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
believe
that
was
a
reason,
and
a
legitimate
reason
for...
and
a
sufficient
reason
for
bringing
the
second
prosecution.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
as
i
said,
the
issues
of
what
punishment
will
be
imposed
at
the
second
trial
are
not
ripe
here,
and
involve
a
lot
of
things,
including
what
version
of
the
guidelines
will
be
applied,
and
so
on.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
do,
and
i
think
if
you
read
the
transcript
of
the
dismissal
hearing
on
the
second
charge
you
will
find
the
judge
was
very
concerned
about
that,
but
i
don't
think
it
has
ever
been
considered
to
take
away
our
right
to
bring
a
second
charge
on
a
different
offense,
no
matter
what
punishment
may
or
may
not...
no
matter
whether
that
conduct
may
or
may
not
have
been
taken
into
account
in
a
prior
separate
offense
prosecution
at
sentencing.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
no.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
first
of
all,
of
course--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--assuming
that
he
was
required,
because
assuming
that
it
was
relevant
conduct,
which
of
course
we
didn't
believe
at
the
time
and
don't
believe
now,
the
court
has
made
quite
clear
that
what
counts
as
mandatory
for
sentencing
purposes
is
the
statutory
maximum
and
minimum
prescribed
by
congress
for
the
offense,
which
in
the
case
of
his
marijuana
conduct
was
5
to
40
years.
now,
it
turns
out
that
however
you
applied
the
guidelines,
or
whatever
conduct
you
took
into
account,
that's
a
broad
enough
range
so
there
was
no
question,
but
that's
the
relevant
mandatory
maximum-minimum.
it's
the
one
prescribed
by
congress.
the
fact
that
congress
in
the
sentencing
guidelines
chose
to
guide
and
channel
the
district
court's
discretion
in
imposing
a
sentence
within
that
range
is
completely
irrelevant
to
whether
it
was
a
sentencing
factor
or
a
conviction
factor,
as
the
court
made
very
clear
in
macmillan.
really,
there's
no
distinction
between
the
kind
of
issue
that
was
posed
in
macmillan
and
that
issue
here.
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
petitioner's
theory
being
that
consideration
at
the
sentencing
phase
of
his
prior
prosecution
of
this
particular
conduct
amounts
to
punishment
for
that
conduct
has
one
very
dramatic
consequence,
which
is
that
every
recidivist
statute
in
every
jurisdiction
in
this
country
is
unconstitutional,
because
every
one
of
those
statutes
involves
considering
at
sentencing
for
one
offense
conduct
that
has
previously
been
considered
at
the
guilt
phase--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--if
it's
known?
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
with
respect,
i
don't
think
so,
because
in
both
cases
what
we
are
talking
about
is
consideration
at
sentencing
on
a
preponderance
standard
of
certain
uncharged
conduct,
conduct
that
was
not
required
to
be
proven
to
the
court
that's
doing
the
sentencing
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
after
an
indictment,
and
so
on
and
so
forth.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
right,
but
if
it
is
punishment
in
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
consider
at
sentencing
conduct
that
has
previously
been
proved,
then
it
is
a
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
enhance
someone's
sentence
at
a
subsequent
prosecution
on
the
basis
of
criminal
conduct
that
was
previously
proved
to
another
jury
in
another
charge.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
absolutely
right,
and
in
our
view
it
cannot
possibly
make
a
difference.
that
has
always
been--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--part
of
the
fabric
of
sentencing
law.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
let
me
make
two
responses,
if
i
may.
the
first
is
that
there
is
a,
if
i
may,
a
crucial
flaw
in
the
way
you--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--posed
the
problem,
which
is
to
say
that
it
is
conduct
for
which
he
has
previously
been
punished.
that
is
not
true.
it
is
conduct
that
has
been
taken
into
account--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--in
punishing
him
previously--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--for
a
different
offense,
and
that
has
never
been
considered
to
be
a
problem--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
or
the
due
process
clause
or
anything
else.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
now,
the
second
point
you
make--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--is
an
excellent
one
and
you
made
it
before,
which
is,
there
are
really
two
possible
arguments
the
petitioner
can
be
making
here,
and
he
conflates
them,
but
i
think
it's
necessary
to
separate
them
out.
one
is
an
argument
based
on
the
constitution,
that
what
we
are
doing
violates
double
jeopardy
per
se
and
that,
we
think,
is
wrong
for
all
the
reasons
that
we've
been
discussing,
that
all
these
court's
cases
are
to
the
contrary
on
both
sentencing
and
due
process.
now,
there
is
also
a
statutory
argument,
i
suppose,
that
could
be
made,
that
congress
intended
when
it
passes...
passed
the
guidelines
and
the
sentencing
reform
act
to
so
transform
the
sentencing
system
that
it
would
in
effect
forbid,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law,
subsequent
prosecution
and
successive
prosecutions
of
this
type.
now,
we
think
that
that
cannot
hold
up,
first
of
all
because
there
is
no
positive
indication
anywhere
in
the
language
or
the
history
of
the
sentencing
reform
act
or
the
guidelines
to
suggest
that
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind,
and
second
because
the
guidelines
themselves
in
section
5g1.3
have
an
explicit
mechanism
which
is
designed
to
take
care
of
exactly
this
kind
of
situation,
where
you
have
successive
prosecutions
for
the
same
kind
of
conduct,
in
fact,
the
same
exact
conduct.
now,
it
is
implausible
that
congress
addressed,
then
the
sentencing
commission
addressed
that
issue
specifically
in
5g1.2
if
they
thought
that
it
was
unconstitutional
anyway,
given
what
they
had
done
to
the
definition
of
offenses.
to
return
for
a
moment
to
the
issue
of
what
you
are
punished
for
when
you
are
punished,
no
matter
what
is
being
taken
into
account,
i'd
like
to
just
point
out
one
example.
the
amount
of
marijuana
involved
in
the
first
prosecution
here
happened
to
be
370
pounds,
and
that
put
mr.
witte
in
the
statutory
sentencing
category
of
5
to
40
years,
a
very
broad
category
which,
as
i
mentioned,
accommodated
any
of
the
possible
changes
in
the
guidelines
range
depending
on
the
relevant
conduct.
but
supposing
it
had
been
50
kilograms
of
marijuana,
then
his
statutory
maximum
sentence
under
section
841,
leaving
aside
unlikely
other
events,
would
have
been
5
years.
now,
suppose
that
the
guidelines
range,
as
it
would
have
been,
would
have
been
33
to
41
months,
in
the
middle
of
that
5-year
range,
and
suppose
the
district
court
had
taken
account
of
the
other
232,000
kilograms
of
marijuana
equivalent
that
it
took
account
of
in
this
case
as
relevant
conduct.
it
would
have
wanted...
it
would
have
been
required
to
enhance
his
sentence,
but
it
would
have
hit
a
statutory
maximum
of
5
years,
and
it
would
have
been
able
to
impose
no
sentence
greater
than
5
years,
because
that's
the
statutory
maximum
for
the
offense
of
conviction.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it's
not
this
case.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
as
a
constitutional
matter,
if
the
two
offenses
are
separate,
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
now,
as
a
guidelines
matter--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--it's
unlikely
that
that--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
have
no
case
where
there
was
a
statute
that
required
it
as
a
matter
of
guidelines.
now,
i
think
the
court
said
in
both
williams
v.
oklahoma--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--and
williams
v.
the
state
of
new
york
that
the
court
has
an
obligation
to
consider
all
conduct
that
comes
before
it.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
in
fact,
there's
a
statutory
obligation
in
this
case--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
he
got
a...
he
was
sentenced
to
life
for
murder
and
then
to
capital--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that's
right,
explicitly
on
the
basis
of
having
committed
the
murder.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
that's--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
not
that
i
can
think
of.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
can
also
say
there's
no
case
holding
to
the
contrary.
there's
no
case
holding,
and
you
know,
certainly
williams
v.
new
york
is
to
the
contrary,
where
the
court
took
into
account
uncharged
conduct
in
imposing
a
death
penalty,
and
there's
no
suggestion
that
if
the
government
had
wanted
to
and
hadn't
thought
it
a
waste
of
resources
it
couldn't
have
gone
and
prosecuted
him
for
those
burglaries
later.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
would
say
that
my
position
is
i
think
with
a
great
deal
of
precedent,
although
i
can't
cite
you
a
specific
case
where,
as
you
say,
the
judge
was
required
in
the
first
case
to
take
account
of
the
same
conduct,
although
i
suspect
that
there
are
such
cases.
i
can't
think
of
one
off
the
top
of
my
head.
that
should
not
be
taken
as
an
indication
that
they
don't
exist.
now,
what
i
think
the
logic
of
your
argument
and
petitioner's
argument
has
to
be
is
that
it
makes
a
difference
whether
the
court
in
the
first
case
is
required
by
congress
to
take
into
account
certain
things
as
sentencing
factors,
or
whether
it
is
not
required
to
take
them
into
account
but
is
allowed
to
do
so
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
and
we
think
that
as
a
constitutional
matter
it
cannot
make
a
difference
whether
the
court
takes
account
of
uncharged
conduct
as
a
purely
discretionary
matter
within
the
statutory
range,
as
a
prescribed
matter
under
the
guidelines,
as
criminal
history...
who
knows
what
they
might
do,
how
they
might
take
account
of
it.
if
it's
constitutional--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--one
way,
it's
constitutional
every--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
don't
see
why
we
wouldn't.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
entirely
a
matter
of...
it
goes
to
the
fact
that
the
court
has
always
said
that
it
is
congress
or
the
legislature
in
any
given
case
that
is
entitled
to
choose
what
is
an
element
of
the
offense
and
what
is
a
sentencing
factor.
now,
the
court
has
recognized
that
there
are
cases
where
that
might
potentially
be
manipulated.
macmillan,
i
think,
stands
for
this
proposition,
that
the
court
will
take
cognizance
that
the
legislature
might
try
to
manipulate
that
and
slip
something
that
should
really
be
an
offense
element
into
the
sentencing
phase.
but
until
the
legislature
does
that,
and
there's
no
case
that
has
ever
held
that
the
legislature
has
done
that,
until
they
do
that,
what
the
legislature
decides
is
an
offense
element
and
a
sentencing
factor
controls,
and
if
it's
a
sentencing
factor,
it
need
only
be
proved
by
a
preponderance,
although
of
course
congress
could
prescribe
something
greater,
and
it
does
not
go
to
the
question
of
whether
you've
been
punished
for
that
conduct.
you've
only
had
that
conduct
taken
into
account
in
enhancing
your
punishment
for
something
else,
of
which
you
have
been
duly
convicted.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
unfortunately,
it
doesn't
jog
my
recollection
on
the
point
of
having
found
another
case.
it
does
bring
up
an
excellent
point,
and
i
do
agree
with
it
entirely.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
agree
with
it
entirely,
and
i
think
it
points
up
that
the
relevant
conduct
provisions
of
the
guidelines
talk,
as
you
say,
in
terms
of
conduct,
not
in
terms
of
offenses,
and
petitioner's
argument
requires
courts,
would
require
courts
to
go
through
an
analysis
where
you
take
that
conduct
and
try
to
figure
out
what
offense
it
constituted
and
then
compare
it
under
the
blockburger
test,
the
elements
of
offense
of
a
new
prosecution.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
would
be
impossible,
but
it
is
difficult,
and--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--in
places
where--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
it's
unusual.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
quite
right,
and
i
would
point
out
again
that
the...
as
respondents,
or
as
petitioners
have
pointed
out,
the
sentencing
commission
has
not
been
notably
satisfied
with
the
way
that
5g1.3
works.
it's
been
amended
several
times.
there
are
some
extensive
amendments
that
have
been
proposed
for
public
comment
right
now.
i
think
that
part
of
what
that
indicates
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
vexing
problems
about
how
you
decide
whether
prior
conduct
has
really
been
taken
into
account
and
whether
it's
comparable
to
the
current
offense
of
conviction
and
how
exactly
one
ought
to
accommodate
all
of
that.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it
gives
the
opportunity...
it
gives
the
government
the
opportunity
to
do
what
the
government
has
always
had
the
opportunity
to
do,
which
is
to
charge
and
convict
for
separate
offenses
at
separate
trials
at
separate
times,
and
allows
the
judge--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--and
allow
the
judge
in
each
case
to
impose
the
sentence
that
he
or
she
thinks
fit
within
the
statutory
maximum
and
minimum
for
the
offense
of
conviction
at
every
trial.
if
the
court
has
nothing
further--
