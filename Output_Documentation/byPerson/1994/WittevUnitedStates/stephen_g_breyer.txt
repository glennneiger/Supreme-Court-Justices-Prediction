justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
i
mean,
the
way
it's
supposed
to
work,
isn't
it...
look,
there
are
two
separate
things.
one
is
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
i
take
it
from
the
year
2,
well
before
the
guidelines,
a
judge
might
decide,
hey,
i'm
going
to
give
you
15
years,
because
i've
looked
at
your
record
and
there
are
about
three
robberies
here
you've
never
been
punished
for,
but
this
is
a
very
bad
guy.
and
then
indeed,
later
on,
a
year
later,
if
the
government
decides
to
indict
him
for
one
of
those
three
robberies,
i've
never
seen
a
case
that
says
they
couldn't
do
it.
but
the
guidelines,
which
is
a
different
matter,
are
supposed
to
not
punish
you
twice
for
the
same
offense,
and
they
can't
think
of
every
possible
unusual
situation,
so
why
wouldn't
you
go
in
here
and
say,
judge,
look,
i'd
like
to
tell
you
something.
in
this
first
case,
they
took
all
this
conduct
into
account.
now,
i
know
that
the
guidelines
haven't
written
words
for
every
situation,
but
what
you
ought
to
do
is
depart
downward
in
this
unusual
situation
in
order
to
take
this
fact
into
account,
which
is
very
unusual.
and
you'll
make
all
your
arguments,
and
if
the
judge
concludes
that
indeed
this
is
really
a
gyp
that
the
government's
indicting
him
twice,
maybe
he'll
listen
to
you,
and
if
the
judge
concludes
that
maybe
your
client
did
something
that
the
government
didn't
reasonably
expect
him
to
do,
maybe
they
won't
listen.
but
i
mean,
isn't
this
just
the
situation
that
you
should
put
your
argument
to
a
judge
as
a
matter
of
discretion
and
departure,
and
not
an
argument
to
the
court
as
a
matter
of
double
jeopardy
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
it's
not
the
fifth
circuit
trial,
it
will
be
up
to
the
sentencing
judge
in
the
future,
in
a
trial
we've
never
even
had
yet.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
guidelines
permit
departure,
is
my
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
isn't
this
exactly
the
kind
of
situation
that
if,
in
fact,
your
client
is
being
badly
treated
in
the
way
you
suggest,
the
judge
ought
to
listen
to
your
argument
and
follow
it,
otherwise
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
is
the
argument
you
would
make,
i
guess,
in
the
future.
look,
the
theory
of
the
thing
is,
if
the
thing
has
been
taken
into
account
the
first
time,
the
judge
isn't
supposed
to
do
it
the
second
time.
he's
already
been
punished.
you
have
a
very
unusual
situation,
i
take
it,
because
the
first
time
involved
a
special
credit
for
cooperation,
so
that's
unusual,
and
you'll
go
to
the
court
and
explain
all
the
reasons
why
the
judge
should
try
to
make
the
thing
match
as
a
departure,
and
the
government,
i
take
it,
would
put
contrary
reasons,
if
that's
what
they
think.
but
isn't
yours
quite
an
unusual
circumstance,
and
for
that
reason,
departure
might
be
called
for,
or
might
not
be.
i
didn't
see
anything
in
any
of
the
opinions
that
addressed
that
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
the
answer...
i
mean,
the
answer
is,
it's
supposed
to
work
out
the
same.
it's
supposed
to,
but
because
of
the
way
in
which
two
consecutive
trials
can
come
about,
unusual
circumstances
can
arise
where
the
literal
wording
of
the
guideline
can't
do
it
because,
for
example,
one
might
have
been
a
state
trial
and
the
other
a
federal
trial,
or
one...
the
second
trial
might
have
taken
place
while
the
man
isn't
in
custody
any
more.
so
you
can
have
unusual
circumstances,
not
all
of
which
could
be
foreseen,
and
so
therefore
there's
a
general
instruction
to
the
judge
or
to
the
bar
and
so
forth,
try
to
make
it
work
in
accordance,
using
your
departure
power
so
it
works
in
unusual
circumstances.
i
mean,
the
guidelines
are
filled
with
statements
like
that,
and
that's
why
i
find
this
more
of
a
guidelines
problem
than
a
jeopardy
problem,
and
your
case
is
not
a
case,
i
wouldn't
think,
where
there's
unfairness,
necessarily,
one
way
or
the
other.
there's
some
reason
here
that
the
government's
decided
to
prosecute
this
case
again,
and
i'm
sure
that
that
reason
is
going
to
be
presented
to
the
judge.
i
mean,
doesn't
it
all
work
out
in
the
guidelines
roughly,
and...
i
guess...
you
haven't
shown
me
that
it
could
be
some
serious
problem--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--with
their
application
if
you
apply
them
intelligently.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
the
problem,
i
think,
was...
i
mean,
i
don't
want
to
put
words
in
other
people's
mouths,
but
i
thought
that
justice
stevens
was
driving
at
the
different
problem
of
a
later
prosecution,
and
what
you
are
prosecuting
this
person
for
is
the
thing
for
which
he
was
punished
previously,
required
by
law.
that's
not
the
recidivism
statute
at
all.
in
a
recidivism
statute
you're
punishing
the
person
for
what
he
did
later,
and
the
amount
of
the
punishment
is
a
function
of
what
happened
before.
but
in
this
case,
what
you're
doing
later
is
you're
convicting
him
of
an
activity
for
which
he
was
previously
punished.
you're
not
increasing
punishment
because
of
what
he
previously
did
for
a
different
thing.
you
are
convicting
him
of
what
he
has
previously
been
punished
for,
and
that...
and
since
these
matters
are
matters
of
criminal...
of
congressional
intent,
there
is
an
open
question,
i
suppose,
about
whether
the
congress
in
passing
these
sentencing
guidelines
has,
in
fact,
manifested
some
kind
of
relevant
intent.
i'm
not
saying
you're
wrong.
i'm
simply
saying
it's
not
so
obvious
a
question
as
the
recidivism
quotation
would
suggest.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
right,
up
till
now.
that
is
a
good
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
there
should
be.
there
should
be,
because
there
are
a
lot
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
probably
agree
with
this,
so
don't
let
me
go
down
the
wrong
track
though
if
it's
not.
i
think
it's
quite
a
difficult
question,
and
rather
deep.
why
isn't
there
this
precedent,
and
there
should...
it
should
turn
out
there
is
such,
because
lots
of
states
have
guidelines
systems
now,
and
you
should
find
the
state
might
try
to
prosecute
somebody
for
a
thing
where
there
has
been,
you
know,
this
kind
of
situation
federally
or
the
other
way
around,
and
the
difficulty,
i
think,
is
that
they
don't
always
call
the
crimes
by
the
same
name.
you
have
a
civil
rights
conviction
and
an
assault
conviction,
you
see,
in
two
different
jurisdictions,
and
what's
worrying
me
is
if
you
suddenly
bring
the
constitution
into
this,
i
don't
see
how
the
constitution's
going
to
get
it...
when
has
there
been
a
prior...
because
the
underlying
things
are
described
in
terms
of
behaviors.
they're
not
described
in
terms
of
crimes.
i'm
saying
this
because
maybe
it
will
jog
your
recollection
that
you
have
found
such
similar
things,
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
would
agree
with
that
because
it's
favorable
to
you,
but--
