justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
just
ask
you
a
preliminary
question
about
that?
the
petitioner
here
is
saying
he
would
receive
a
multiple
punishment
for
the
cocaine
offense
if
this
second
prosecution
proceeds
and
he's
sentenced.
why
is
that
claim
ripe
now?
i
take
it
he
has
not
received
a
second
sentence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he
hasn't
been
convicted
in
the
second
proceeding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why,
then,
is
that
claim
ripe?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
gives
you
a
claim
at
this
juncture.
i
was
troubled
by
it,
and
i
wondered
how
you
would
deal
with
it.
i
also
am
troubled
by
how
you
would
distinguish
that
case
of
williams
v.
oklahoma,
where
we
held
that
the
use
of
evidence
of
an
uncharged
crime
at
sentencing
for
the
crime
for
which
the
prosecution
succeeded,
doesn't
constitute
punishment
for
the
uncharged
conduct,
and
it
seemed
to
me
quite
close.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if,
at
the
second
proceeding,
if
the
conviction
were
obtained
and
if
the
sentence
imposed
were
identical
to
the
one
previously
imposed,
credit
given
for
time
served,
run
concurrently,
could
there
be
a
double
jeopardy
violation,
if
that
were
the
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
just
wonder
if
we
aren't
jumping
the
gun
a
little
bit
here
to
assume
it's
going
to
be
different.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
you
explained
yet
what
the
government's
purpose
might
be
in
having
a
second
prosecution?
might
it
be
to
encourage,
if
you
will,
the
defendant
to
cooperate
in
connection
with
the
second
offense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
a
possibility?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
a
three-times-you're-out
sort
of
a
statute?
the
government
might
want
another
prosecution
and
conviction
for
purpose
of
a
three-time-loser
statute?
i
mean,
i'm
just
trying
to
figure
out
why
the
government
wants
to
do
this.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
guidelines
do
seem
to
expressly
provide
that
if
the
offense
has
been
fully
taken
into
account
in
the
determination
of
the
sentence
already
given,
that
the
new
sentence
will
run
concurrently.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
the
guidelines
seem
to
contemplate
this
very
occurrence
on
occasion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
accommodate
it
by
requiring
a
concurrent
sentence.
