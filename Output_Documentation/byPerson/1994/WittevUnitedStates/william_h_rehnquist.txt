chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-6187,
steven
kurt
witte
v.
united
states.
mr.
sokolow,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
term...
did
the
opinion
in
williams
v.
oklahoma
use
the
term
merger?
i
read
it
recently,
and
i
don't
recall
it
using
that
term.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
with
a
case
like
williams
v.
new
york,
another
williams
case,
which
says
that
courts
have
traditionally
taken
into
consideration
all
sorts
of
conduct
in
deciding
what
sentence
shall
be
imposed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
by
the
term
"merge"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
that's
a
good
idea.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
weren't
going
to
use
the
term
"merged".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
was
not
convicted
the
first
time
of
the
same
thing
that
he
will
be
convicted
of
if
a
jury
comes
in
against
him
the
second
time,
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
are
you
saying
basically
that
the
guidelines
prevent
his
being
sentenced
a
second
time,
or
tried,
or
that
because
of
what
the
guidelines
do,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prevents
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
mr.
sokolow,
earlier
i
thought
you
said
your
claim
here
was
a
double
jeopardy
claim,
that
given
the
way
that
the
guidelines
operated,
the
necessary
sentence
would
be
imposed
after
the
forthcoming
trial,
would
be
a
violation
of
double
jeopardy,
but
now
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
if
you
interpret
the
guidelines
properly
that
would
satisfy
your
client's
interest.
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
ordinarily
we
would
take
those
up
in
reverse
order.
that
is,
we
wouldn't
reach
a
constitutional
question
if
there
were
some
statutory
question
to
be
answered
first.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
simply
wanted
to
inquire
about
what
you
were
urging
upon
the
court.
i
wasn't
trying
to
give
you
any
ideas
of
my
own.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
sokolow.
mr.
dumont,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dumont.
mr.
sokolow,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we're
talking
about
now
the
first
prosecution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sokolow.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
second
case
is
number
94-6187,
witte
against
the
united
states.
in
february,
1992,
the
petitioner
here
steven
witte
pleaded
guilty
to
a
federal
marijuana
charge.
at
sentencing,
the
district
court
took
into
account
under
the
guidelines,
the
total
quantity
of
drugs
involved
not
only
in
witte's
offensive
conviction,
but
also
of
the
narcotics
involved
in
certain
other
uncharged
criminal
conduct
arising
out
of
the
same
conspiracy
including
a
plan
to
import
a
quantity
of
cocaine
from
central
america.
the
witte
was
later
indicted
for
conspiring
and
attempting
to
import
the
same
cocaine
which
was
considered
in
the
sentencing
of
the
marijuana
offenses.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
charges
on
grounds
that
punishment
for
the
cocaine
offenses
would
violate
the
double
jeopardy's
clause.
the
court
of
appeals
for
fifth
circuit
reversed.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit.
traditionally,
a
sentencing
judge
can
consider
a
broad
range
of
inquiry
into
the
defendant's
background,
past
criminal
behavior
and
arriving
at
an
appropriate
punishment.
but
the
consideration
of
the
uncharged
conduct
in
deciding
on
a
sentence
within
the
statutorily
authorized
punishment
range
doesn't
constitute
punishment
for
that
conduct
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
that
is,
a
defendant
in
that
situation
is
only
punished
for
the
offenses
of
which
he
was
convicted.
in
a
case
decided
in
1959
called
williams
against
oklahoma,
we
specifically
rejected
the
claim
that
the
double
jeopardy
principles
bar
a
later
prosecution
or
punishment
for
criminal
activity
where
that
activity
has
been
considered
at
sentencing
for
a
separate
crime.
now
the
reason
that
this
case
and
other
cases
applies
of
equal
force
here.
justice
kennedy
and
i
have
joined
all
but
part
iii
of
justice
o'connors
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
joined
only
part
iii.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
