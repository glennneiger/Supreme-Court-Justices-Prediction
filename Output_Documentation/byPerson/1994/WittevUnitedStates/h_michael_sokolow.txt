mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
double
jeopardy
clause
protects
against
the
government
seeking
a
second
punishment
for
the
same
offense
in
a
second
prosecution.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
government's
attempt
to
punish
mr.
witte
for
cocaine
offenses
previously
included
in
relevant
conduct
violates
that
protection.
the
facts
of
this
case
illustrate
exactly
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
was
designed
to
protect
against.
they
also
illustrate
how
these
federal
sentencing
guidelines
can
be
defeated
and
eliminated.
mr.
witte
was
sentenced
to
12
years
in
federal
prison
after
buying
375
pounds
of
marijuana
from
federal
agents.
that
sentence
was
based
upon
two
things.
it
was
based
upon
a
guideline
range
of
292
to
365
months,
which
included
all
prior
marijuana
offenses
and
all
prior
cocaine
offenses
negotiated
or
committed
by
mr.
witte.
it
was
further
based
upon
mr.
witte's
cooperation
and
a
government
request
to
reduce
his
sentence.
the
government
has
now
indicted
mr.
witte
for
the
same
cocaine
offenses
and
seeks
to
punish
him
again.
the
express
language
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
shows
that
mr.
witte
was
previously
punished,
and
that
he
will
be
punished
again.
the--
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
--that
is
correct.
he
has
not
yet
been
sentenced
on
the
second
prosecution.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
he
has
not
been
convicted,
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
the
reason
the
claim
is
ripe
is
because
under
the
federal
drug
guideline
and
the
other
language
of
the
guidelines,
all
offenses
were
merged
for
purposes
of
punishment
in
the
first
prosecution,
and
mr.
witte
has
received
all
punishment
that
he
can
receive.
the
government
is
barred
from
the
end...
obtaining
the
end
of
the
second
prosecution...
that
is,
any
further
punishment.
since
there
can
be
no
punishment,
there
can
be
no
criminal
judgment.
thus,
proceeding
to
the
end
and
putting
mr.
witte
through
that
process--
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
--it
is
not
close
at
all,
your
honor,
and
here's
why.
in
williams
v.
oklahoma,
this
court
sought
in
vain
for
a
cross-reference
between
the
murder
statute
and
the
kidnapping
statute.
finding
no
cross-reference...
that
is,
no
merger
of
the
two
crimes
for
purposes
of
prosecution,
no
merger
of
the
two
crimes
for
purposes
of
punishment,
it
found
no
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and
said,
well,
this
is
just
a
mere
enhancement.
in
this
case,
the
federal
drug
guideline
2d1.1
and
the
policy
decisions
made
by
the
commission
effect
a
merger
for
purposes
of
punishment,
and
that
is
exactly
where
the
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause--
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
--it
does
not
use
that
term,
but
it
does
look
specifically
for
a
cross-reference
between
the
two
statutes.
i
infer
from
the
court's
seeking
a
cross-reference
between
the
two
statutes
that
it
was
looking
for
some
sort
of
merger
that
would
prohibit
either
the
second
prosecution
or
the
second
punishment,
or
it
would
not
have
sought
some
cross-reference
between
the
two
statutes.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
courts
have
traditionally
done
that,
and
the
only
thing
courts
have
had
to
look
at
prior
to
the
sentencing
guidelines
was
what
was
in
the
statute.
here
we
have
a
new
set
of
sentencing
guidelines
that
specifically
prescribe
punishment,
that
specifically
merge,
and--
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
--well,
for...
let's
forget
the
term
merged.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
let's
look
at
2d1.1.
2d1.1
and
the
grouping
provisions
state,
group
the
offenses,
drug
offenses,
according
to
their
weight.
the
guidelines
also
say
drug
offenses
present
a
fungible
harm
and
therefore
ought
to
be
grouped.
so
what
happens
is,
the
drug
offenses,
we
arrive
at
a
guideline
by
grouping
them,
by
getting
a
total
weight
of
the
drugs.
now,
if
the
government
brings
four
charges,
let's
say,
the
drug
guidelines
group
them
and
come
up
with
one
guideline
range.
if
the
government
brings
one
charge,
the
drug
guidelines
still
group
the
offenses
and
come
up
with
the
same
guideline
range.
what
is
happening
in
this
case...
that
is,
if
mr.
witte
pleads
guilty
to
all
charges
or
one
charge,
the
guideline
range
is
still
the
same.
what's
happening
in
this
case
is,
the
government
is
bringing
one
charge.
the
guidelines,
the
mechanism
still
works
the
same
way.
mr.
witte
has
the
same
guideline
range,
and
the
government
says,
aha,
all
the
offenses
have
been
grouped,
mr.
witte
has
gotten
all
the
punishment
he
could
get
under
the
guidelines,
now
let
us
lop
off
one
of
the
merged
offenses
that
was
punished--
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
--let
us
lop
off
one
of
the
grouped
offenses
that
was
punished,
let
us
go
back
to
the
federal
criminal
code,
let
us
charge
another
one
of
the
offenses
that
was
grouped,
and
let
us
run
mr.
witte
through
the
sentencing
guidelines
again,
where
all
offenses
will
be
grouped,
and
he
will
receive
a
second
punishment
on
the
group
offenses.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
that
is
correct,
but
the
guidelines,
the
commission
expressly
made
the
decision
to
minimize
the
significance
of
the
charging
system.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
because
of
what
the
guidelines
do,
and
the
way
they
group
offenses
for
punishment,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibits
mr.
witte
being
punished
again
in
the
same
exact
way.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
in
the
first
prosecution,
the
guideline
range
was
292
to
365
months,
based
on
the
grouping
of
all
offenses.
because
of
the
government's
motion
for
a
departure
downward,
the
sentence
was
144
months.
in
the
second
prosecution,
the
relevant
conduct
and
guideline
range
will
again
be
292
to
365
months,
so
mr.
witte
is
looking,
for
the
same
grouped
offenses
at
an
additional
exposure
at
a
minimum
of
118
months,
and
for
the
same
grouped
offenses,
an
additional
exposure
of
191
months,
which
i
believe
is
approximately
an
additional
15
years.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
if
the
sentences
are
concurrent,
he's
still...
he
is
looking
at
an
additional...
because
the
government
made
the
motion
for
the
downward
departure,
and--
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
--i
believe
what
the
government
says
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
says
should
happen
in
the
second
prosecution
is
that,
let's
assume
mr.
witte
had
gotten
292
months,
a
minimum
under
the
guideline
range.
the
government
and
the
fifth
circuit
are
saying,
okay,
he's
been
in
jail
30
months
when
this
second
prosecution
sentence
is
handed
down.
if
he
gets
365
months,
take
off
30
months,
and
then
run
the
365
months
concurrent
with
the
262
left,
so
his
exposure
would
be
an
additional
15
years.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
section
5g1.3(b)
says
that
the
sentences
should
be
concurrent,
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
second
sentence
will
not
add
a
significant
amount
to
the...
in
other
words,
they're
not
going
to
be
strictly
concurrent
with
the
exact
same
amount
of
time.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
as
the
fifth
circuit
read
it,
and
as
i
read
it,
i
do
not
believe
the
district
court
is
going
to
have
any
authority
to
allow
mr.
witte
to
walk
out
of
prison
at
the
same
time
he
would
have
after
the
first--
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
--no,
it's
not,
and
here's
why.
we
already
know
what
the
fifth
circuit
answer's
going
to
be.
the
fifth
circuit
answer
is
going
to
be,
mr.
witte,
go
serve
an
additional--
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
--but
we
know
that
the
sentencing
judge
is
going
to
follow
the
guidelines.
we
know--
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
--they--
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
--i
don't
see...
i
understand
that
you're
talking
about
5k2.0,
where
it
wasn't
considered
by
the
sentencing
commission,
but
i
don't
see
how
a
judge
could
reduce
the
sentence
and
make
it
run
strictly
concurrently.
the--
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
--the
argument
on
the
other
side
would
be...
if
the
government
prevails
in
this
case,
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is,
well,
judge,
clearly
the
commission
considered
this
under
5g1.3(b),
and
clearly
this
is
the
way
it's
supposed
to
work.
how
can...
if
5g1.3(b)
does
apply,
and
mr.
witte,
as
the
fifth
circuit
said,
is
supposed
to
get
an
additional
118
months,
how
can
you
walk
in
front
of
a
district
judge
and
say,
judge,
the
sentencing
commission
hasn't
considered
this,
even
though
the
supreme
court
and
the
fifth
circuit
say
5g1.3(b)
applies,
please
reduce
the
sentence?
they'll
say
back
to
me,
wait
a
minute,
5g1.3(b)
expressly
applies,
even
though
we
disagree
with
that,
but
that
will
be
the
answer.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
it
is
an
unusual
circumstance.
i
think
if
mr.
witte
does
not
prevail
here,
i
think
that
the
government
will
have
an
argument
that
5g1.3(b)
does
expressly
take
that
into
account,
and
therefore
i
will
be
foreclosed.
but
in
addition,
if
mr.
witte
has
received
all
of
the
punishment
he
should
have
received
under
the
sentencing
guidelines
for
the
group
defenses,
why
does
the
government
have
the
right
to
put
him
through
the
jeopardy
of
facing
more
punishment
that
he
should
not
get
under
the
sentencing
guidelines?
why
should
mr.
witte
be
waiting
in
harris
county
jail
to
see
if
the
judge
is
going
to
agree
with
us
or
not?
why
should
he
go
through
that
anxiety
when
the
sentencing
guidelines
have
worked
the
way
they
should
have
worked
in
accordance
with
the
policy
of
congress
to
bring
about
uniformity
in
sentencing,
to
bring
about
proportionality
in
sentencing,
in
accordance
with
the
policy
and
the
sentencing
guidelines
to
reduce
the
significance
of
the
charging
decision,
to
avoid
double
counting
for
drug
crimes,
to
treat
them
as
fungible
harms?
when
mr.
witte
goes
up
and
faces
his
maker
to
receive
from
262
to
365
months
on
all
those
offenses,
why
should
he
again
go
to
meet
his
maker
for
the
very
same
offenses?
and
mr.
witte's
argument
does
not
apply
across
the
board.
the
guidelines
are
not
monolithic.
the
guidelines
make
policy
decisions
about
what
is
a
fungible
harm
and
what
isn't
a
fungible
harm.
i
think
we
would
have
a
different
situation
if
mr.
witte
had
committed
five
bank
robberies,
because
those
are
not
grouped
under
the
guidelines,
or
assaults
are
not
grouped
under
the
guidelines.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
that
is
correct.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
it's
not
bringing
them
all
in
one
proceeding,
because
he's
forced
to
be
put
in
jeopardy
again
for
the
same
guideline
range
and
additional
punishment.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
that's
correct.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
yes.
the
way
it
would
have
worked
is,
if
the
government
brought
four
charges...
you
know,
conspiring,
importing,
conspiring
to
possess
with
intent
to
distribute,
and
attempting
to
possess,
if
they
brought
four
charges
the
guideline
range
still
would
have
been
262
to
395
months.
the
judge
would
have
imposed
the
sentence,
whatever
it
is.
then
that
sentence
would
have
run
concurrent,
each
of
the
four
sentences
would
have
run
concurrent
with
each
other.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
okay.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
there...
if
i
understand
the
hypothetical
correctly,
the
danger
of
having
the
second
prosecution
and
trial
is
that
a
second
trial
judge
gets
to
impose
a
sentence
anywhere
within
the
guideline
range.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
the
range...
the
range
is
not
different.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
the
exposure
under
the
range
is
the
same,
yes,
but
the
way
the
fifth
circuit
calculated
it,
you
only
get
credit
for
time
that
you've
served,
so
if
the
same
sentence
is
imposed--
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
--the
serious--
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
--well,
the
fifth
circuit
has
already
told
us
if
you
apply
them
as
they
see
it
mr.
witte
is
facing
an
additional...
at
a
minimum,
an
additional
118
months,
and
that
is
a
serious
problem.
there--
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
--that's
correct.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
that's
right.
there's
nothing
to
show...
nothing
in
the
record,
nothing
that
i
know
that
will
show
that
there
will
be
any
departure
in
the
second
case,
so
what
happens
is,
the
first
judge
reviewed
all
offenses,
as
grouped
under
the
guidelines,
looked
at
mr.
witte's
cooperation,
exercised
the
discretion
that
was
granted
to
him
under
the
guidelines
with
a
motion
to
depart
downward,
decided
what
the
case
was
worth.
now
the
government
lops
off
one
of
those
offenses,
goes
back,
indicts
it,
and
we
get
back
to
the
grouped
offenses,
and
it
will
completely
nullify
the
judge's
discretion
in
the
first
case.
it
will
take
away
the
motion
for
departure
downward.
the
consequences
of
the
government's
case
are
that
it
does
away
with
the
commission's
attempt
to
limit
the
significance
of
the
charging
decision.
it
does
away
with
the
grouping
of
all
offenses.
it
defeats
the
congressional
goals
of
uniformity.
it
defeats
the
judge's
discretion
to
depart
downward.
for
the
guidelines
to
work
and
to
be
consistent,
both
parties
have
to
be
bound
by
them.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
no.
i
think
what
i'm
arguing
is
that
the
guide...
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
be
violated
if
he
is
again
sentenced
under
the
guidelines,
but
that
in
addition
it
also
is
contrary
to
the
goals
that
congress
sought
in
the
sentencing
reform
act,
and
the
goals
that
the
commission
sought
in
writing
the
guidelines.
it's
not
that
they're
both
the
same.
it's
just
that
number
1,
the
double
jeopardy
clause
will
be
violated,
and
number
2,
by
the
way,
the
purposes
of
congress
will
be
defeated.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
well,
if
the
court
decides,
of
course,
that
it
would
violate
the
intent
of
congress
under
the
sentencing
reform
act
and
it
would
violate
the
intent
of
the
commission
and
the
express
language
of
the
guidelines
to
prosecute
and
to
punish
him
again,
then
the
court...
you're
correct,
the
court
need
not
reach
the
double
jeopardy
decision.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
no.
i
believe
it
is
a
double
jeopardy
decision.
the
problem
here
is,
congress
and
the
commission
didn't
need
to
promulgate,
or
there
was
no
necessity
to
promulgate
guidelines,
but
having
promulgated
those
rules
for
use,
and
mr.
witte
having
been
punished
under
those
rules,
putting
him...
punishing
him
again
under
those
rules
violates
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
chief
justice,
with
your
permission
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
point
out
first
that
the
government
says
that
it
has
always
had
the
opportunity
to
bring
separate
charges
and
obtain
different
punishments.
the
sentencing
reform
act
and
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
changed
that
system
because
of
the
disproportionate
sentences
that
came
about.
it
changed
that
system
because
congress
wanted
uniformity
and
honesty
in
sentencing.
the
fact
that
the
government
cannot
now
bring
subsequent
prosecutions
to
try
to
get
different
sentences
is
something
that
congress
wanted
to
bring
about.
now,
let
me
say
a
few
words
about
the
record
in
this
case.
the
record
in
this
case
show...
shows
that
number
1,
the
government
filed
a
criminal
complaint
alleging
all
acts
and
all
offenses
at
the
outset
of
the
case.
there's
no
reason--
mr.
h.
michael
sokolow
--the
first
prosecution
started
out
with
a
criminal
complaint,
and
the
affidavit
alleged
all
of
the
facts
and
transactions
in
both
the
cocaine
offenses
and
the
marijuana
offenses.
the
government
didn't
file
it
under
seal.
it
didn't
try
to
keep
it
secret.
the
government,
in
the
motion
to
dismiss
hearing
in
this
case,
when
questioned
by
the
judge
about
a
castlebaugh
problem
said,
oh,
no,
judge,
we
had
all
the
evidence
before
mr.
witte
pleaded
guilty
in
the
first
case.
so
they
had
all
the
evidence
to
prosecute
him.
they
could
have
filed
an
indictment
then,
and
could
have
gotten
their
conviction.
if
there
was
a
problem
finding
mr.
parkorny,
they
had
plenty
of
tools
in
their
arsenal.
they
can
get
a
continuance
under
the
speedy
trial
act
to
try
to
apprehend
fugitives.
they
can
try
the
cases
separately
and
merge
them
for
sentencing.
the
government
is
not
precluded
by
getting
another
conviction
at
the
same
time
when
it
alleged
all
those
facts
at
the
outset
of
the
first
prosecution.
finally,
i'd
like
to
point
out
the
government
cannot
cite
a
reason
for
pursuing
this
prosecution
that
puts
mr.
witte,
according
to
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion,
in
jeopardy
for
an
additional
118
months.
i
think
the
court
can
only
infer
that
the
reason
it's
going
after
this
is
to
get
a
second
bite
at
an
apple,
to
get
additional
punishment,
which
is
exactly
what
the
double
jeopardy
clause
prohibits.
your
honors,
we
request
that
you
reverse
the
decision
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
dismissal
of
the
indictment
in
this
case.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
