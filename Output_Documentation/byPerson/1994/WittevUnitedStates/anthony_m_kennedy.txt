do
the
guidelines
require
that
the
sentences
be
concurrent?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that,
but
there
will
be
substantial
concurrency,
and
the
district
court
has
no
authority
to
alter
that
result
and
impose
a
consecutive
sentence?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
will
you
tell
us,
in
response
to
the
question
justice
o'connor
asked
of
the
petitioner's
counsel,
if
in
your
view
there
is
no
prematurity
here,
that
we
have
the
issue
squarely
before
us,
and
subsidiary
to
that,
why
are
you
prosecuting
this
person
a
second
time
if
you
don't
intend
to
enhance
his
punishment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
the
sense
i
have
is
that
the
whole
purpose
of
prosecuting
him
is
so
that
you
can
impose
some
additional
punishment.
now,
maybe
that...
and
that
leads
to
the
second
question
i
asked.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
the
government
was
busy,
that
it
had
a
heavy
criminal
case
load.
