there
wouldn't
be
any
problem
if
they
were
all
tried
in
the
same
proceeding.
you
wouldn't
say
these...
you
wouldn't
have
any
objection.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i...
there's
nothing
that
seems
so
obvious
to
me
about
the
injustice
of
doing
it
one
way
or
the
other.
when
you
say
that
all
that
injustice
can
simply
be
eliminated
by
trying
them
all
in
one
proceeding,
the
double
punishment
doesn't
seem
to
me
such
a
horrible
thing.
you're
just
saying...
really,
it
isn't
the
double
punishment
that's
the
problem,
it's
not
bringing
them
all
in
one
proceeding
that's
the
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
worried
about
the
jeopardy,
you're
complaining
about
the
punishment.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
that's
perfectly
okay,
so
long
as
they
all
did
it
in
one
proceeding?
i
find
it
hard
to,
you
know,
get
righteously
indignant
about
that
injustice.
but
do
you
agree...
i
just
want
to
be
clear
on
one
thing.
do
you
agree
that
in
a
single
proceeding
he
could
have
received
as
much
punishment
as
he
might
now
receive?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
point
is
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it
was
required
to
be
previously
proved
or
was
previously
proved
and
considered
as
a
discretionary
matter.
the
fact
that
it
has
been
done
previously
makes
the
later
one
a
second
one,
whether
it
was
done
discretionarily
or
not.
