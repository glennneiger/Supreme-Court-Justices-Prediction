justice
john
paul
stevens
before
you
get
into
that,
could
i
ask
you
one
question
about
your
explanation
of
why
the
second
prosecution
was
appropriate?
you
said
the
coconspirator
had
not
been
apprehended,
so
you
couldn't
proceed
against
the
coconspirator,
but
i
don't
understand
why
that
made
it
necessary
to
proceed
a
second
time
against
this
defendant,
because
you
could
have
proceeded
against
him
without
indicting
this
person
again.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
assuming
this
case
went
just
as
it
did.
am
i
correct...
let
me
make
sure
i...
this
is
kind
of
complicated.
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
all
of
the
relevant
conduct...
put
it
the
other
way
around,
that
all
of
the
cocaine
activity
that
is
alleged
in
the
second
indictment
was
taken
into
account
as
relevant
conduct
in
the
first
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then,
tell
me
again,
why
is
it
you
need
the
second
trial
against
this
particular
defendant,
if
it's
not
to
get
additional
punishment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
by
the
time
you
brought
the
second
trial
it
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
did
you
have
to
bring
the
second
trial
against
this
defendant
if
it
was
not
for
the
purpose
of
getting
more
punishment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
may
be.
it's
entitled
because
it
wants
to
get
additional
punishment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
arguing
about
what
you're
entitled
to
do.
i'm
just
asking
about,
is
there
any
reason
for
doing
it
other
than
to
get
additional
punishment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
the
reason
was
simply
to
get
another
conviction
on
his
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sort
of
like
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
difference
in
this
case
from
the
williams
and
the
other
cases
is
that
the
conduct
may
have
been
taken
into,
or
in
fact
was
taken
into,
but
under
the
guideline
system,
the
trial
judge
at
the
first
trial
was
required
by
law
to
take
into
account
the
relevant
conduct.
doesn't
that
make
a
difference?
i
guess
you'd
say
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
none
of
those
statutes
require
consideration
at
the
first
trial
of
the
conduct
for
which
he
is
indicted
in
the
second
trial.
none
of
them
require
that,
whereas
this
statute
does
require
that
the
cocaine
conduct
be
considered
at
the
marijuana
trial,
if
it's
known.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
distinguishes
all
of
the
recidivist
statutes
that
you
refer
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
was
required
to
be
proved,
and
it
was
proven,
and
was
relied
on
just
as
if
it
had
been
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that's
not
this
case,
and
you
don't
have
a
statutory
maximum.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
just
the
opposite,
supposing
that
that
would
have
required
a
20-year
sentence,
say
there
was
no
statutory
maximum,
and
then...
but
they
only
indicted
him
for
the
lesser
amount,
and
you're
saying
they
could
impose
that
sentence
and
then
subsequently
indict
him
for
the
larger
amount
and
then
impose
an
additional
sentence.
that's
your
position,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there's
no
precedent--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
have
a
precedent
for
that
ever
having
been
done
by
any
court,
where
at
the
first
trial
there
was
a
requirement
by
statute
or
rule
or
whatever
it
might
be
that
certain
relevant
conduct
aggravate
the
sentence,
and
it
was
imposed,
and
then
subsequently
the
person
was
indicted
and
convicted
of
the
aggravating
offense?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
in
the
williams
case
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
in
the
williams
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--when
he
was
indicted
for
kidnapping,
at
the
prior
proceeding
for
murder
there
was
no
indication
that
the
kidnapping
aggravated
his
offense.
it
couldn't
have
been,
because
he
got
a
lesser
sentence
that
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
for
the
kidnapping
he
got
death.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
right,
but
at
the
murder
trial...
the
point
is
that
at
the
murder
trial
there
was
no
reliance
on
the
kidnapping
as
relevant
conduct
that
would
aggravate
the
offense,
and
that's
what
you've
got
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
of
your
cases,
i
don't
think
you
can
cite
a
single
case
where
the
relevant
conduct
at
the
first
offendment
aggravated
the
sentence
and
then
was
the
subject
matter
of
a
second
indictment.
or
can
you?
maybe
you
can
give
me
a
case
like
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no,
but
it
seems
somewhat
counterintuitive
to
me
to
say
that
a
man
could
be
punished
for
relevant
conduct
in
proceeding
a,
yet
have
that
aggravate
a
sentence
that
would
not
otherwise
have
been
imposed,
then
say
in
proceeding
b,
we
can
go
ahead
and
punish
him
again
for
the
same
relevant
conduct,
and
all
i'm
suggesting
is,
your
position
is
without
any
precedent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
in
the
first
trial--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
guidelines
or
some
procedure
required
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
before
they
could
take
into
account
relevant
conduct?
would
you
still
take
the
same
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wouldn't
think
you
would,
either,
right,
actually.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you'd
only
have
to
do
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you'd
only
have
to
do
it
when
the
government
sought
to
indict
somebody
for
the
same
conduct
which
had
already
enhanced
punishment.
i
mean,
that
doesn't
happen
very
often.
i
mean,
this
is
a
very
unusual
case,
i
think,
or
maybe
it
isn't.
i
don't
know.
it
seems
to
me
it's
somewhat
unusual.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
doesn't
it
boil
down
the
fact
that
if
the
sentences
have
to
run
concurrently,
that...
and
the
government
thinks
the
first
judge
was
too
lenient
and
too
much
of
a
downward
departure
or
something,
it
gets
a
second
bite
at
the
apple,
says
well,
maybe
the
second
judge,
even
though
it
will
run
concurrently,
will
give
a
longer
sentence
the
second
time.
that's
what
it
gives
the
government
the
opportunity
to
do,
it
seems
to
me,
is
to
get
the
maximum
sentence
for
the
relevant
conduct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
always
had
this
opportunity,
but
you
haven't
been
able
to
find
a
case
where
they've
ever
done
it
before.
