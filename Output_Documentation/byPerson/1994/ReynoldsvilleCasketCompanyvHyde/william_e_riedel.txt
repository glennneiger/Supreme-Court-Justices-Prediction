mr.
william
e.
riedel
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
general
question
that
was
before
the
ohio
supreme
court
was,
should
a
decision
that
establishes
a
new
rule
of
law
apply
to
events
that
occurred
before
the
date
of
the
decision?
the
specific
issue
before
the
ohio
court
was,
should
the
decision
of
this
court
in
bendix
v.
midwesco
in
june
of
1988,
wherein
ohio's
tolling
statute,
2305.15,
was
declared
to
be
unconstitutional
as
being
in
violation
of
the
commerce
clause,
apply
to
time-bar
the
respondent's
lawsuit
of
august
of
1987
for
bodily
injury
arising
out
of
a
motor
vehicle
accident
that
took
place
between
the
parties
in
march
of
1984,
and
at
all
times
before
and
after
this
accident,
ohio
had,
continues
to
have,
a
2-year
statute
of
limitations
for
the
filing
of
personal
injury
actions.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
everybody.
the
petitioners,
the
corporation
and
its
driver
were
residents
of
pennsylvania.
the
respondent
likewise
was
a
resident
of
pennsylvania.
although
the
ohio
trial
court
and
a
court
of
appeals
both
answered
the
specific
issue
in
the
affirmative...
in
other
words,
bendix
applies
retroactively
to
the
parties
and
the
respondent's
lawsuit
was
time-barred...
when
the
question
was
presented
to
the
ohio
supreme
court,
it
reversed
the
decisions
of
the
lower
court
and
stated
that
bendix
should
not
be
retroactively
applied
to
the
parties
in
this
case.
it
was
not
a
unanimous
decision.
it
was
5-2.
the
rationale
of
the
ohio
supreme
court,
the
majority,
for
denying
the
retroactive
application
of
bendix,
was
essentially
twofold,
and
it
appeared
in
parts
i
and
part
ii
of
the
majority's
opinion.
in
part
ii
of
the
majority's
opinion,
the
court
placed
its
reasoning
on
this
court's
decision
in
harper
v.
virginia,
and
that
is
clear
because
the
majority
stated,
even
if
the
chevron
case
test
has
been
replaced
by
harper,
the
retroactive
application
of
bendix
remains
impermissible.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
i
overcome
harper
by
virtue
of
the
constitutional
issue.
the
violation
in
harper
was
a
real
violation.
there
is
no
constitutional--
mr.
william
e.
riedel
--in
bendix,
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
it
is,
but
not
in
this
case.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
yes.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
--was
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
exactly.
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
recognized
the
unconstitutionality
of
that
statute
in
this
case.
the
respondent
has
conceded
to
the
unconstitutional...
of
that
statute
in
this
case,
in
that
sense.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
backward-looking
relief
for
underlying
constitutional
violation.
i
don't
believe
that
there
was
an
underlying
constitutional
violation
in
this
case.
the
majority
went
on
to
state
that
harper
allows
state
courts
to
tailor
their
own
remedies
as
they
determine.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
i
do.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
yes.
what
i'm
trying
to
do,
your
honor
is,
justice
scalia,
is
distinguish
why
this
majority
opinion
is
wrong.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
yes.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
that
is
true,
justice
ginsburg,
and
what
the
majority
went
on
to
state
was
that
harper,
their
reading
of
harper,
allowed
state
courts
to
tailor
their
own
remedy
as
they
determine
the
manner
in
which
a
united
states
supreme
court
opinion
was
to
be
retroactively
applied.
and
what
the
majority's
manner
of
tailoring
in
this
case
was,
was
to
employ
a
provision
of
the
ohio
constitution,
article
i,
section
16,
and
state
that
that
prohibited
the
application
of
bendix
to
the
parties
in
this
case,
and
specifically
with
regard
to
article
i
and
section
16,
the
majority
stated,
"we
find
that
when
there
is
a
conflict
between
a
state
constitutional
civil
right,
article
i,
section
16,
and
a
federal
rule
of
decision,
the
bendix
case,
that
is
not
rooted
in
the
constitution,
such
as
retroactivity,
the
civil
right
prevails.
"
the
rationale
of
the
majority,
in
part
ii
of
its
decision,
in
denying
full
retroactivity
to
the
parties
in
this
case,
is
wrong,
and
that's
been,
i
believe,
so
conceded
by
the
respondent
in
this
case.
they
state--
mr.
william
e.
riedel
--no,
and
i'd
like
to
talk
about
that
a
little
later,
justice
ginsburg,
as
to
why,
if
chevron
is
in
fact
applied,
that
even
if
it
is
applied,
it
would
not
achieve
the
result
that
the
majority
found
in
this
case.
the
respondent
has
conceded
with
the
petitioners,
we
agree,
that
the
clear
command
of
the
supremacy
clause
of
the
constitution
displaces
all
conflicting
state's
law.
what
is
left,
therefore,
in
this
case
to
support
the
denial
of
full
retroactivity
of
the
bendix
decision
is
the
logic
of
part
i
of
the
majority's
opinion,
and
whereas
in
part
ii
was
premised
upon
the
majority's
reading
of
harper,
in
part
i
the
court
denied
retroactivity
by
resort
to
a
chevron
analysis,
and
again,
that's
clear
because
the
court
said,
"if
chevron
remains
good
law,
then
chevron,
not
harper,
provides
the
proper
test
to
apply
to
the
present
case.
"
without
quite
saying
so,
i
would
submit
that
the
majority
had
its
doubts
regarding
the
continued
viability
of
a
chevron
analysis.
that's
evidenced
by
statements
in
the
majority's
opinion
that
it
is
unclear
whether
harper
was
intended
to
replace
chevron
or
supplement
it:
if
chevron
remains
good
law,
even
if
chevron
has
been
replaced
by
harper,
whether
or
not
chevron
remains
good
law.
despite
what
i
believe
were
legitimate
reservations
about
chevron,
the
court
nevertheless
went
ahead
and
did
a
chevron
analysis,
and
although
the
majority
did
not
so
state,
i
would
submit
that
its
resort
to
chevron
was
solely
in
the
context
of
a
choice
of
law
analysis.
in
other
words,
the
new
law
or
the
old
law.
the
issue
of
remedy,
the
second
prong
of
the
court's
opinion,
was
discussed
in
part
ii.
in
other
words,
when
the
court
went
on
to
say,
harper
allows
the
courts
to
tailor
their
own
remedy.
part
i
of
the
opinion,
its
chevron
inquiry,
the
term
"remedy"
was
never
mentioned
by
the
majority.
it
never
used
the
term,
because
i
would
submit
the
court
viewed
chevron
as
a
vehicle
for
determining
choice
of
law.
again,
old
law,
resort
to
the
continued
use
of
the
tolling
statute,
or
new
law,
bendix,
2305.15
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
in
this
case,
in
my
opinion,
justice
souter,
there
is
no
issue
as
to
remedies.
i
believe
it
is
a
matter
of
application
of
the
old
law
or
the
new
law.
just
as
the--
mr.
william
e.
riedel
--well,
in
terms
of
courts
that
must
follow
this
court's
decision,
this
court's
decision...
this
court
in
1988
said
in
bendix
that
that
statute
was
unconstitutional.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
correct,
and
between
1988
and
when
the
ohio
supreme
court
decided
this
case
in
february
of
1994,
those
principles
had
not
changed.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
no,
i
don't,
sir.
i
don't
think
that
is
a
distinction.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
yes.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
yes.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
that
is
true,
and
even
if
the
court...
i
don't
believe
that
the
ohio
court
looked
at
chevron
in
a
remedial
sense
as
you
are
talking
about,
but
rather,
a
choice
of
law,
but
if--
mr.
william
e.
riedel
--sure.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
sure.
even
if
you
did
it
in
a
remedial
sense,
what
occurred,
in
terms
of,
i
think,
a
time
frame
in
this
case
is
significant
to
look
at.
this
accident
between
the
parties
occurred
in
march
of
1984.
three
days
later,
march
8
of
1984,
the
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
ohio
in
copley
v.
heil-quaker
ruled
this
particular
statute
as
being
unconstitutional.
june
of
1987,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
in
bendix
v.
midwesco,
in
a
unanimous
opinion,
this
statute
is
unconstitutional.
the
respondent's
lawsuit
was
still
not
filed.
respondent
did
not
file
this
lawsuit
until
over
2
months
later,
august
of
1987.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
that
it
would
not--
mr.
william
e.
riedel
--that
the...
the
statute
was
clearly
settled,
i
believe.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
well,
certainly,
you
know,
the
first
test
of
chevron
is
the
overruling
of
past...
or
clear
past
precedent,
or
deciding
an
issue
of
first
impression
whose
resolution
was
not
clearly
foreshadowed.
the
lawsuit
had
not
been
filed.
these
decisions
are
out
there.
'84
and
'87,
this
statute
was
unconstitutional--
mr.
william
e.
riedel
--okay.
i'm
sorry.
i
would
like
to
use
it,
and
i
think
i
see
your
point.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
i
believe
so.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
i
do
not
know.
i
think
that
would
be
perhaps
a
proper
question--
mr.
william
e.
riedel
--i
don't
know,
justice
ginsburg.
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
i
think
it
is
the
same
as
ohio.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
everybody
was
from
pennsylvania,
and
so
i
believe
the
statute
was
likewise
2
years
in
pennsylvania.
the
same
rule
would
apply
there.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
bendix
was
decided
in
june
of
1988.
this
court
decided
bendix
in
june
of
1988.
this
accident
occurred
in
march
of
'84.
the
lower
court,
the
district
court
declaring
the
tolling
statute
in
ohio
unconstitutional
occurred
3
days
after
this
accident.
the
6th
circuit
declared
the
same
statute
unconstitutional
approximately
2
months
before
this
lawsuit
was
filed.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
yes,
ma'am.
yes.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
the
district
court
and
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
no.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
yes.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
yes.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
correct,
yes.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
that's
correct,
and
so
to
address
what
you
had
asked
me
earlier
about,
if
chevron...
the
chevron
test
were
applied
to
this
case,
which
the
majority
attempted
to
do,
or
at
least
they
said
they
were
going
to
do
in
part
i
of
the
opinion,
clearly,
they
didn't
even
address
the
first
issue
in
chevron,
the
clear
precedent
or
the
foreshadowing
argument,
because
what
the
ohio
majority
said
was,
bendix
was
the
first
time
that
any
court
of
binding
authority
in
ohio
state
courts
had
ruled
the
tolling
statute
unconstitutional.
that's
not
the
test
from
chevron.
the
test
from
chevron,
at
least
the
threshold,
the
first
test,
is
clear
past
precedent
or
no
clear
foreshadowing.
i
would
submit
there
was
a
lack
of
clear
past
precedent,
the
district
court,
the
sixth
circuit
decision
and,
clearly,
foreshadowing
this
court's
decision
in
june
of
1988.
the
second
factors,
and
the
third
factor
from
chevron's--
mr.
william
e.
riedel
--yes.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
if
the
respondent
wanted
to
rely
upon
the
tolling
statute
and
not
the
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
i
believe
it
was
in
new
jersey.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
yes.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
that
was,
i
believe,
'83,
in
that
area.
i
believe
that
was...
or,
i
don't
think
it
struck
it
down
at
that
point,
but
it
addressed...
it
addressed
the
issue
of
a
similar
tolling
statute
in
new
jersey
under
the
commerce
clause
parameter.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
yes.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
yes.
the
second
and
the
third
test,
the
chevron
test,
the
majority
never
even
addressed
those
tests
in
this
particular
case.
there
was
not
one
word
said
as
to
an
analysis
of
two
and
three
from
chevron.
what
the
court
did
say
was
that
it
didn't
have
to
do
that
because
the
facts
of
the
two
cases
were
so
similar,
and
i
would
submit
that
they're
not
similar
facts,
and
that
they're
quite
different,
chevron
and
this
case.
what
is
also
uniquely
different
about
the
two
cases
was
the
manner
in
which
the
constitutional
challenge
was
raised.
in
chevron,
the
issue
was
not
raised
until
after
this
court
decided
rodriguez
v.
aetna.
in
this
case--
mr.
william
e.
riedel
--chevron
had
to
do
with
which
statute
of
limitations
were
going
to
apply
to
a
louisiana--
mr.
william
e.
riedel
--i
don't
think
so,
sir.
again,
going
back
to
the
distinction
between
chevron
and
this
case,
chevron,
the
issue
was
not
raised
until
after
this
court
decided
rodriguez
v.
aetna.
in
this
case,
at
the
very
first
moment,
the
petitioners
raised
the
unconstitutionality
argument
of
2305.15,
and
the
right
to
rely
upon
ohio's
2-year
statute
of
limitation.
there
was
no
delay
whatsoever
on
the
part
of
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
petitioners
did
not
rely
upon
anybody
to
raise
the
initial
arguments
that
were
ultimately
ruled
upon
by
this
court
in
bendix
in
june
of
1988.
whether
a
finding
that
a
decision
is...
truly
applies
retroactively
has
any
practical
effect
i
believe
depends
upon
the
remedial
implications
of
that
finding.
if
equitable
considerations
are
ignored,
or
are
to
be
ignored
in
assessing
the
retroactive
impact
of
a
decision,
as
i
read
the
beam
decision,
chevron
does
not
apply
to
choice
of
law,
we
can
discard
that,
but
courts
are
permitted
to
shape
the
remedial
calculus,
then
declaring
a
decision
retroactive
might
be
of
little
consequence.
other
courts
will
follow
the
lead
of
the
ohio
court.
yes,
it's
retroactive,
but...
but,
state
courts,
we
have
the
right
to
tailor
our
own
remedies
as
we
determine
the
manner
in
which
a
decision
of
the
united
states
supreme
court
is
to
be
applied
retroactively.
that's
exactly
what
the
majority
did
in
this
case.
their
resort
to
the
latter
inquiry
resulted
in
conferring
constitutional
status
on
an
unconstitutional
statute.
i
think
there
are
two
points
clear
from
this
court's
decisions
in
beam
and
harper.
all
of
this
court's
rulings
apply
retroactively
unless
the
court
expressly
reserves
judgment
on
the
issue.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
correct.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
it
is.
it
has
been
stipulated.
and
second,
once
a
decision
is
applied
retroactively
to
one
set
of
parties,
it
must
be
applied
retroactively
to
all
similarly
situated
litigants.
because
2305.15,
the
tolling
statute,
was
declared
to
be
unconstitutional
by
this
court
in
bendix
in
june
of
1988,
thus
permitting
midwesco
industries
to
avail
itself
of
ohio's
statute
of
limitations,
that
same
logic
should
apply
to
the
parties
in
this
case.
anything
to
the
contrary
is
disparate
treatment
between
similarly
situated
litigants.
i
would
respectfully
request
that
the
decision
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
be
reversed
and
this
court
reinstate
the
decision
of
the
lower
courts.
thank
you.
mr.
william
e.
riedel
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
waive
the
balance
of
my
rebuttal
argument.
