well,
how
do
you
overcome
harper,
mr.
riedel?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
think
there
was
no
constitutional
violation
here
or
in
bendix?
the
statute
was
not
unconstitutional?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
is
this
very
statute,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me?
i
mean,
the
holding
in
bendix--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--was
that
the
statute
we're
talking
about--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--was
unconstitutional.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
harper
had
indicated
that
backward-looking
relief
is
required.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
haven't...
under
the
chevron-type
approach,
haven't
we
said,
if
the
rule
is
clearly
foreshadowed,
it's
not
a
new
rule?
i
mean,
that
is
certainly
an
argument
that
could
be
made
here,
even
if
chevron
remained.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can
we
talk--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--about
it
here?
