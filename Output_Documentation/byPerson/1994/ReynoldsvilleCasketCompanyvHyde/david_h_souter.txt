justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
riedel,
is
there
any
choice
of
remedies
in
this
cas,
or
is
the
choice
simply
between
a
remedy
and
no
remedy?
justice
david
h.
souter
couldn't
you
just
as
readily,
then,
answer
my
question
by
saying
the
choice
is
between
applying
bendix
and
not
applying
bendix,
those
are
the
only
two
choices?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
we
don't
have
to
even
assume
that
here,
because
i
take
it
the
choice-of-law
issue
is
subject
to
stipulation.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
dyk,
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
the
word
"remedial"
gets
used
throughout
this
case,
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
at
some
point
in
the
future,
or
at
the
present
time,
for
that
matter,
the
savings
statute
is
going
to
be
applied
or
whether
it
isn't.
there's
nothing
to
remedy
from
the
past.
the
state
hasn't
been
acting
unconstitutionally.
it
hasn't
been
collecting
taxes
that
it
shouldn't
have
collected,
and
so
on.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
savings
statute
is
going
to
be
applied
or
whether
it
isn't
going
to
be
applied.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
correct
me
on
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
not
going
to
be
applied.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
left?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
isn't
the
effect
of
the
tolling
in
effect
to
come
up
with
a
rule
which
is
identical
to
the
savings
statute?
so
that
if
you
say,
well,
we
will
allow
tolling
as
a
result
of
surprise,
we
are
in
fact
to
that
extent
applying
a
kind
of
savings
clause
which
would
have
been
within
the
savings
clause
that
everyone
agrees
is
unconstitutional,
and
the
analysis
is
turned
into
kind
of
a
legal
shell
game.
we
say,
ah,
well,
the
savings
clause
as
written
doesn't
apply,
but
we've
got
something
else
just
as
good
which
has
precisely
the
same
effect.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
this
case,
it
will
in
fact
have
the
same
effect.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
mr.
dyk,
that
goes
to
the...
doesn't
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
go
to
the
choice
of
law?
in
other
words,
we
would
say,
you
can't
raise
this
issue.
you
cannot,
in
effect,
proffer
the
claim
for
relief,
because
there's
some
kind
of
a
state
bar.
we've
passed
that
point.
you've
raised
your
claim,
your
claim
is
good,
there
is
no
question
that
bendix
applies,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether,
in
an
instance
in
which
there
is
no
choice
of
remedy
in
the
sense
that
there
may
be
remedy
a,
b,
or
c,
as
in
tax
cases
for
example,
in
a
case
in
which
there
is
only
one
choice,
and
that
is,
if
you
apply
the
statute,
if
you
apply
the
constitutional
rule,
you
can't
apply
this
statute,
the
alternative
being
that
if
you
apply
this
statute,
you
are
in
fact
not
applying
the
constitutional
rule,
is
there
really
any
choice
of
remedy,
and
i
would
suppose
that
this
case
was
distinguishable
from
the
paradigm
of
the
tax
cases
in
which
there
are
various
alternatives.
there's
just
an
either-or
question
here,
and
if
you
answer
the
remedial
question
differently
from
the
choice-of-law
question,
you
come
back
to
what
i
suggested
a
moment
ago.
it's
just
kind
of
a
shell
game.
now
you
see
it,
now
you
don't.
justice
david
h.
souter
ah,
but
federal
habeas
i
think
is
a
slippery
analogy,
because
in
federal
habeas
we've
already...
the
very
premise
in
federal
habeas
is
that
there
has
already
been
one
completed
process
of
direct
appeals
in
which
these
kinds
of
issues
can
be
raised.
federal
habeas
is
a
supplementary
process.
there's
nothing
supplementary
about
this.
the
only
way
the
defendants
in
this
case
can
raise
the
constitutionality
of
the
savings
clause
is
the
way
they've
raised
it.
this
is
their
only
shot.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
would
like
to
say
there's
a
distinction
because
of
the
constitutional
rule
that
we're
dealing
with
here,
although
i
recognize
that
there
have
been
instances
in
which
the
court
has
not
immediately
applied
its
constitutional
rule,
but
even
in
those
cases,
i
would
suppose
that
the
prospective
application
to
the
particular
claimant
was
such
that
there
was
not
being
a
denial
of
all
relief
simply
by
deferring
constitutional
relief.
here,
however,
there's
an
either-or
choice.
this
claimant
gets
it,
or
this
claimant
gets
nothing.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
were
not
constitutional
cases.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you...
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
don't
you
think
the
states,
the
options
open
to
the
states
are
affected
by
beam
and
harper,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
ohio
court
can
do
what
you
want
it
to
do,
then
all
of
the
professions
in
beam
and
harper
are
very
hollow,
because
in
fact
the
statute
can
apply...
the
ruling
can
apply
in
the
first
case,
the
ruling
can
therefore
necessarily
be
retroactive,
because
there's
no
selective
prospectivity,
but
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
because
the
remedial
hand
can
simply
take
away
what
the
choice-of-law
hand
hath
given.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
it's
just
saying,
we
won't
honor
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
even
in
that
instance,
mr.
dyk,
the
very
premise
of
applying
harmless
error
is
that
there
is
nothing
that
requires
a
remedy,
i.e.,
a
mistake
was
harmless.
nothing
need
to
be
corrected.
here,
you
are
looking
at
a
prospective
application
of
a
constitutional
standard,
and
you
are
going
in
effect
to
deny
this
person
the
benefit
of
a
constitutional
rule.
those
cases
aren't
comparable.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
those
were
cases
at
least,
as
i
was
saying
about
habeas,
in
which
somebody
had
a
shot
at
raising
the
issue,
and
you
know,
we
can
argue
and
give
an
instance
as
to
whether
the
person
was
at
fault
or
negligent,
or
what-not,
for
not
raising
the
issue
and
prevailing,
but
in
any
event,
there's
no
such
arguable
choice
here.
this
is
the
only
time,
the
only
case
in
which
this
issue
can
be
raised.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
want
them
to
go
in
and
invite
the
lawsuit
in
order
to
get
the
benefit
of
a
constitutional
remedy?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
maybe
they
should
have,
but
i
mean,
the
two
situations
are
not
comparable.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
saying
they
should
have
as
a
basis
for
justifying
ohio's
result.
