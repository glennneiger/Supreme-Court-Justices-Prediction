chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
94-3,
the
reynoldsville
casket
company
v.
carol
hyde.
mr.
riedel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
accident
took
place
where,
in
ashtabula
county
in
ohio?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
parties
were
pennsylvanians?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
a
less
profound
level,
mr.
riedel,
was
it
just
coincidence
that
both
the
vehicles
involved
in
this
case
were
from
pennsylvania?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
reason
to
know
why
the
suit
was
brought
in
ohio
rather
than
pennsylvania?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
was
our
case
of
searle
v.
cohn.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
we
didn't...
we
simply
have
pretermitted
that
question
when
we
gave
our
decision,
did
we
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
riedel.
mr.
dyk.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
the
part
that
relied
on
the
ohio
constitution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
district
court
decision,
mr.
dyk?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
weren't
in
fed
supp,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
ordinarily
that
sort
of
legitimate
state
interest
doesn't
triumph
over,
you
know,
a
flat
declaration
that
the
thing
is
unconstitutional
from
this
court
on
federal
grounds.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
harmless
error
doctrine
is
itself
a
federal
doctrine
from
chapman
v.
california.
it
says
a
state
may
affirm
a
conviction
if
it's
convinced
that
a
constitutional
error
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
did
not
cause
any
harm
to
the
defendant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
is
for
reynoldsville.
reynoldsville
is
being
treated
by
the
ohio
courts
just
the
way
bendix
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dyk.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
riedel,
you
have
7
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
the
court
in
number
94-3,
reynoldsville
casket
company
v.
hyde
will
be
announced
by
justice
breyer.
