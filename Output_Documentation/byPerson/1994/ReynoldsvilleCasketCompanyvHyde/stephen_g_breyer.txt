justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mrs.
hyde
is
the
respondent
in
this
case
she
is
from
ohio.
she
was
in
an
automobile
accident
which
involved
the
truck
owned
by
a
pennsylvania
company,
it’s
called
reynoldsville
casket.
she
sued
the
company
in
ohio
more
than
three
years
after
the
accident
and
normally
that
would
have
been
too
late
because
the
ohio
statute
it
is
only
two
years.
but
there
was
a
special
tolling
provision
in
the
ohio
law
which
gave
her
more
time
to
sue
a
company
because
it
was
out
of
state
and
while
her
suit
was
pending
this
court
in
a
case
called
bendix
held
that
tolling
provision
was
unconstitutional.
so
reynoldsville
immediately
came
in
and
said
you
have
to
dismiss
your
suit.
the
supreme
court
in
a
different
case
held
that
this
tolling
provision
is
unconstitutional.
while
the
supreme
court
of
ohio
said,
we
don’t
have
to
dismiss
the
suit
because
we’re
not
going
to
apply
this
law
to
the
people
whose
cases
were
pending
at
that
time
and
we
had
to
decide
if
they
could
do
that
and
basically
this
court
has
held
that
if
a
new
rule
of
constitutional
law
applies
to
the
case
in
which
the
court
announces
it,
it
also
applies
to
all
pending
cases.
that
would
seem
to
require
a
judgment
for
reynoldsville
and
mrs.
hyde
argued
rather
complicated
argument
that
really
what
was
going
on
as
they
were
applying
the
rule
backwards
but
they
just
didn’t
give
reynoldsville
a
remedy,
and
we
in
our
opinion
say
well
we
don’t
really
see
that
as
a
distinction
and
we
go
through
the
various
cases
that
she
sights
in
support
and
we
distinguish
them
and
we
ultimately
come
to
the
conclusion.
it’s
not
a
distinction
that
ohio
has
to
apply
our
new
rule
retroactively,
that
ohio
has
to
apply
the
rule
to
her
case
and
therefore
reynoldsville
is
entitled
to
judgment.
there
is
in
fact
as
well
justice
scalia
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
joins
and
justice
kennedy
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
o’connor
joins.
