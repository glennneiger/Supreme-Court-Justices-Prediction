justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
clear
that
we
have
old
law
and
new
law
here?
i
thought
that
perhaps
one
reading
of
bendix
at
least
is
that
it
relied
on
established
legal
principles,
so
it's
not
a
change
of
law.
there's
not
new
law
and
old
law,
and
that
is
a
way
to
distinguish
chevron.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
settled
legal
principles.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
could
just--
--and
that
is
my
point,
and
i
think...
isn't
that
a
distinction
between
this
case
and
chevron?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
when
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
the
doubt
about
the
validity
of
this
statute
was
established
under
clearly
settled
principles--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
that's
different
than
chevron,
and
that's
a
way
of
distinguishing
this
case
and
chevron,
but
you
don't
seem
to
want
to
accept
that
distinction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i'm
asking,
isn't
that
different
than
the
chevron
case,
but
you
say
no.
you
don't
want
to
rely
on
that
distinction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
was
so
because
this
case
relied
on
well-settled
principles.
it
is
different
from
chevron.
you
seem
to
be
resisting
this.
i
thought
it
was
an
argument
in
your
favor.
if
you
don't
want
to
use
it,
you
don't
have
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
had
there
been
a
delaware
case
that
had
struck
down
a
statute
similar
to
this?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
it
was
in
new
jersey.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
was
the
date
of
that
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
an
ongoing
constitutional
violation.
what
ohio
has
done
is
to
say
that
we
cannot
cease
an
ongoing
constitutional
violation,
and
that
seems
to
a)
questionable
and
b)
distinguishable
from
chevron.
