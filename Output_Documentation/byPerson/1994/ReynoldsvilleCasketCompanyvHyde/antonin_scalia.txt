justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
i'm
really
getting
confused
here.
you're
not
running
away
from
harper.
you
like
harper,
don't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
to
put
it
another
way,
foreign
corporations
should
be
subjected
to
suit
indefinitely,
brought
by
people
who
were
relying
on
their
ability
to
sue
foreign
corporations
indefinitely.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
just
slicing
out
a
small
category
of
the
unconstitutional
statute,
but
it's
still
essentially
applying
the
same
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
here,
its
effect
is
to
preserve
an
unconstitutional
statute
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
are
relying
on
the
unconstitutional
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
what
it
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
go...
i
asked,
why
should
we
ever
rule
on
the
unconstitutionality
of
a
statute
of
limitations,
then?
i
mean,
it's
really
a
phony
case.
ohio
can
go
ahead
and
pass
all
the
unconstitutional
statutes
of
limitations
it
wants,
because
there's
no
case
in
which
i
can
see
anybody
has
standing,
because
you
know
if
you
strike
it
down
the
ohio
supreme
court's
going
to
be
say,
well,
yes,
it
was
an
unconstitutional
one,
but
in
light
of
the
fact
that
you
relied
on
it,
we'll
allow
you
to
have
that
additional
time.
how
do
you
ever
get
a
lawsuit?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
there's
no
reason
why
such
a
provision,
if
it's
operative
against
federal
decisions,
couldn't
be
applied
to
substantive
matters
as
well.
that
is,
if
there
is
a
surprise
ruling
by
this
court
that
a
particular
substantive
provision
of
ohio
law
is
unconstitutional,
the
ohio
court
could
say,
well,
you
know,
that's
a
surprise,
and
we're
going
to
preserve
expectations
by
not
applying
that
retroactively.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
why
is
that
different
from
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
a
federal
right
doesn't
exist,
that
the
state...
the
state
substantive
provision
is
unconstitutional,
under
which
a
plaintiff
was
suing.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
they
were
legitimate,
if
they
were
genuinely
protecting
expectations,
i
guess
you'd
have
to
say
its
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
rule
is
shaped
around
the
former
ohio
tolling
rule.
it
is
entirely
shaped
around
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
certainly
would
not
allow
them
to
bring
the
suit
later
than
that
rule
would
have
allowed.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
measure
it
by
that
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
misunderstand
me.
i'm
not
saying
that
they're
applying
the
same
statute.
they
are
applying
a
rule
of
surprise.
but
what
are
you
enabled
to
do
by
reason
of
the
surprise?
what
you
are
enabled
to
do
by
reason
of
the
surprise
is
to
sue
for
as
long
as
that
old,
unconstitutional
would
have
allowed
you
to
sue.
not
any
longer
than
that.
