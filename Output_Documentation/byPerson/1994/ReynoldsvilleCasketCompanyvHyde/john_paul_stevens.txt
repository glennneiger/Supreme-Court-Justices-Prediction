justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
refresh
my
recollection
about
chevron?
was
that
a
constitutional
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
was
there
any
constitutional
issue
in
it?
i
didn't
remember
one.
that's
why
i
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
dyk,
can
i
ask
you
a
more
basic
question?
i
fully
understand
your
drawing
an
important
distinction
between
the
choice-of-law
rule
and
the
remedy
rule,
and
you
say
here
all
you're
doing
is
talking
about
remedy.
but
is
it
not
at
least
arguable
that
in
this
case
we've
held,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
that
it's
a
burden
on
interstate
commerce
to
compel
this
out-of-state
company
to
defend
a
lawsuit
that's
filed
after
the
normal
statute
of
limitations
is
run,
in
which
event
we're
not
really
talking
about
remedy,
but
we're
talking
about
whether
or
not
we
will
allow
another
constitutional
violation
to
take
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
they're
arguing,
as
they
did
in
bendix,
that
requiring
us
to
defend,
unlike...
at
a
time
when
a
local
company
would
not
have
to
defend,
is
itself
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
justice
scalia's
position
rested
on
discrimination.
the
majority
rested
on
balancing
rocks
against
lions,
or
something
like
that,
as
i
remember
it.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
just
another
way
of
saying
it's
giving
a
different
reason
for
the
same
unconstitutional
violation.
