mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we,
of
course,
do
not
take
issue
with
the
harper
decision
on
the
choice-of-law
issue,
and
i
should
make
clear
that
in
the
oral
argument
before
the
ohio
supreme
court,
which
came
after
the
harper
decision,
mr.
eardley
and
mr.
zulandt
did
not
argue
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
had
any
discretion
with
respect
to
the
choice-of-law
aspect
of
harper.
we
agreed
then,
we
agree
now,
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
had
no
choice
with
respect
to
the
choice-of-law
issue,
and
that
the
first
part
of
its
decision
suggesting
otherwise
is
wrong.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no,
your
honor.
the
second
part
of
the
ohio
supreme
court
decision
relied
on
section
i...
article
i
section
16
of
the
ohio
constitution,
the
right
to
the
remedy
provision,
and
that
second
part
of
the
ohio
supreme
court's
decision
holds
that
the
right
to
a
remedy
provision
tolled
the
2-year
statute
of
limitations.
and
i
recognize
that
unfortunately
the
ohio
supreme
court
misperceived
its
role
even
in
the
second
part
of
the
opinion,
because
what
they
suggested
there
was
that
the
ohio
constitution
trumps
this
court's
choice
of
law
rules
even
if
they
apply
to
remedies,
but
i
think
what
the
ohio
supreme
court
really
meant
to
say,
or
at
least
should
have
said,
was
that
the
remedial
provisions
in
the
ohio
constitution
were
consistent
with
federal
law,
were
consistent
with
the
harper
case,
and
we
believe
that
they
were,
in
fact,
consistent
with
the
harper
case.
harper,
of
course,
did
not
preclude
states
from
applying
their
remedial
schemes
to
the
vindication
of
federal
rights.
a
majority
of
this
court
in
american
trucking,
in
beam,
and
in
harper,
and
individual
justices
have
recognized
that
the
issue
of
remedial
discretion
is
an
important
one,
and--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i
don't
understand
that
to
be
the
issue
at
all,
justice
souter.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
the
savings
statute,
[<twenty-three
oh
five
point
one
five>]
is
unconstitutional.
it
is
gone.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
the--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--it's
not
going
to
be
applied.
it
is
not--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--what
is
left
is
the
general
principle,
applied
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
reflected
in
the
state
constitutional
provision,
which
provides
for
tolling
the
2-year
statute
of
limitations
because
of
surprise
to
this
plaintiff
and
other
people
similarly
situated.
in
other
words,
it
is
quite
a
different
rule
of
law.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
justice
souter,
i
do
not
think
it
has
precisely
the
same
effect.
with
respect
to
all
future
cases
and
all
people
who
are
on
notice
of
the
bendix
decision,
their
claims
will
be
precluded
unless
they
are
brought
within
the
2-year
statutory
period.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
it
has
the
same
result,
but
the
reasoning
is
entirely
different.
the
reasoning
is
not
that
foreign
corporations
should
be
subjected
to
suit
indefinitely.
that
is
not
the
ground
for
the
state
supreme
court
decision
here.
the
ground
for
the
state
supreme
court
decision
is
that
people
who
are
surprised
should
have
the
benefit
of
tolling
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
as
the
eli
lilly
case
in--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--no,
justice
scalia,
it
is
not
applying
the
same
statute,
it
is
applying
article
i,
section
16
of
the
ohio
constitution,
which
has
been
applied
routinely
in
other
cases
to
save
causes
of
action
where
people
were
not
on
notice
that
they
should
have
brought
the
case.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that
is
true,
but
we
think
that
there
is
nothing
unusual
about
that.
this
court
in
the
area
of
federal
law
in
habeas
corpus,
in
qualified
immunity,
with
respect
to
statutes
of
limitations
under
chevron,
with
respect
to
title
vii,
has
recognized
the
appropriateness
of
protecting
these
reliance
interests,
and
if--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--let
me
see
if
i
can
explain,
justice
ginsburg,
the
situation.
the
accident
took
place
in
ashtabula,
which
is
very
close
to
the
pennsylvania
border.
the
plaintiff
retained
shortly
after
the
accident
an
ohio
lawyer
who
states
that
he
relied
on
the
tolling
provision
which
was
invalidated
in
bendix
in
not
bringing
suit,
and
now
one
of
the
reasons
for
suing
in
ohio
rather
than
in
pennsylvania
would
be,
for
example,
that
the
witnesses,
the
trial
witnesses
would
not
be
subject
potentially
to
subpoena
in
pennsylvania,
such
as
the
state
police
officer
or
the
ambulance--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
don't
think
it
had
become
anachronistic.
there
was,
in
fact,
no
decision
in
the
ohio
state
system,
and
we
are
talking
about
the
ohio
state
system,
suggesting
that
that
tolling
provision
was
in
any
way--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i
think
the
reasons
are
articulated
in
this
court's
decisions
in
searle
and
bendix,
that
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
use
long
arm
statutes,
and
it
is
easier
for
people
to
use
the
tolling
provision
and
rely
on
that,
and
that's
what
happened
here.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes,
they
did,
but
they
were
interpreted
to
continue
to
have
validity
after
the
long
arm
statutes
came
in,
and
if
a
lawyer
is
sitting
in
his
office
in
ashtabula
and
trying
to
figure
out
when
he's
supposed
to
bring
suit,
he
looks
at
the
statutory
provisions
and
he
says,
i
have
an
indefinite
period
of
time
to
bring
suit,
because
i
am
dealing
with
an
out-of-state
corporation,
and
then
he
goes
to
research
the
law.
what
does
he
find?
what
he
finds
is
a
new
jersey
decision
in
mid-1983
saying
that
the
new
jersey
statute
is
unconstitutional,
but
the
new
jersey
statute
is
very
different
from
the
ohio
statute.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
justice
ginsburg,
the
statute
may
not
have
been
desirable
policy,
the
statute
may
have
not
been
necessary
any
more,
but
the
statute
was
there
on
the
books,
and
people
relied
on
it,
and
they
are,
we
think,
entitled
to
rely
on
tolling
provisions
on
the
books
that
have
never
been
questioned
in
the
ohio
courts
and
that
have
been
routinely
applied.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
there
were
three
district
court
decisions.
judge
potter
had
decided
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
in
two
companion
cases,
one
of
which
came
up
to
this
court
as
bendix.
judge
rubin
and
judge
brown
had
reached
opposite
results.
they
held
the
statute
constitutional.
now,
none
of
these
three
decisions
was
reported
or
accessible
to
ordinary
lawyers.
we're
talking
10
years
ago,
before
lexis
and
weslaw.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
they
weren't
in...
none
of
the
three
was
in
federal
supplement,
but
there
was
a
conflict
there
in
the
district
courts.
there
was
no
sixth
circuit
authority
on
this,
and
there
certainly
was
no
authority
in
the
ohio
court
system
suggesting
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
that
this
statute
was
invalid,
and
under
this
court's
decisions
applying
chevron,
we
understand
that
you
are
entitled
to
look
to
the
decisions
within
the
forum,
within
the
jurisdiction,
and
anyone
doing
that
would
not
have
found
reason
to
believe
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
and
as
i
started
to
suggest
earlier
while
this
court's
decision
in
searle
might
have
raised
a
question
about
the
new
jersey
statute,
the
new
jersey
statute
was
very
different
from
the
ohio
statute.
the
new
jersey
statute
required
that
you
become
licensed
to
do
business
in
the
state
as
a
way
of
getting
the
statute
of
limitations
to
run.
the
ohio
statute
had
no
such
requirement
in
it.
it
merely
required
the
employment
of
an
agent
for
service
of
process.
now,
the
difference
between
the
two
is
significant,
because
under
the
new
jersey
statute,
when
you
registered
you
became
liable
to
taxation
in
the
state.
the
ohio
statute
imposed
no
such
requirement,
and
this
court
in
searle
suggested
strongly
at
the
end
of
its
opinion
that
there
was
a
critical
difference
between
a
statute
like
the
new
jersey
statute
and
a
statute
like
the
ohio
statute,
so
it
wasn't
so
clear
that
even
if
this
new
jersey
decision
were
correct,
that
it
would
apply
in
ohio.
now,
the
only
other
published
decision
that
came
along
was
the
decision
of
the
sixth
circuit
in
bendix,
which
came
along
about
2
months
before
this
plaintiff
filed
suit.
again,
it's
not
a
decision
of
the
ohio
system.
it
was
on
review
in
this
court,
but
even
if
she
were
bound
to
look
at
that,
if
she'd
looked
at
it
we
certainly
think
that
filing
suit
approximately
2
months
later
was
filing
within
a
reasonable
time
and
that
ohio,
applying
its
right-to-a-remedy
provision,
could
protect
that
interest
legitimately.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
there
would
not
be
normally
a
disparity
in
the
treatment
of
identically
situated
people,
because
this
ohio
constitutional
provision
would
apply
to
any
suit
that
was
brought
in
ohio.
that
issue
apparently
wasn't
raised
in
the
bendix
case.
if
they'd
raised
that
issue,
they
would
have
been
treated
the
same
way
as
mrs.
hyde.
that
is,
that
there
would
have
been
tolling
of
the
statute
of
limitations
as
a
result
of
this
surprise
factor.
we
have
suggested
on
our
brief,
and
this
is
important,
that
we
satisfy
the
chevron
oil
standard,
which
is--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--but
that
happens
all
the
time,
justice
scalia,
and
that
is
the
law
about
adequate
and
independent
state
ground
in
this
court
which
is
very
similar.
a
lot
of
people--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--bring
cases
with
federal
issues
in
them.
the
federal
issue
may
not
ultimately
be
responsive--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--but
justice
souter,
that
happens
frequently.
it
happens
in
federal
habeas,
it
happens
in
qualified
immunity,
it
happens--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--but
justice
souter,
in
at
least
two
cases,
chevron
oil
and
st.
francis,
this
court
has
held
it
appropriate
to
toll
statutes
of
limitations
under
federal
law
where
there
has
been
surprise.
it
is
a
traditional
thing
to
have
tolling
of
statutes
of
limitations
where
people
are
surprised.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
think
that
was
true
in
chevron
and
st.
francis
also.
it
happens--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--they
were
not
constitutional
cases,
but
they
arose
under
federal
law,
and
i
would
have
supposed,
justice
souter,
that
the
states
had
greater
authority
than
the
federal
courts
to
define
the
appropriate
scope
of
their
statutes
of
limitations.
they--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
was
going
to
refer
to
the
chase
case,
which
recognizes
that
states
can
go
so
far
as
to
revive
an
entirely
expired
statute
of
limitations.
there
are
many
state
doctrines
which
preclude
the
litigation
of
federal
claims.
res
judicata
is
one
of
them.
if
this
court
decides
a
case,
the
states
are
not
obligated
to
go
back
and
reopen
closed
cases.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
justice
souter,
i
don't
believe
that's
true.
first
of
all,
the
state
at
a
minimum
has
to
be
an
applying
an
established
and
legitimate
principle
of
law
to
deny
the
federal
right.
that's
required
by
the
supremacy
clause,
and
here
i
think
there's
no
question,
there's
not
even
an
argument
that
ohio
was
in
any
way
discriminating
against
the
federal
right,
and
i
think
it
is
clear
from
its
case--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--we
won't
honor
it,
but
it's
not
doing
anything
that's
peculiar
to
the
federal
right.
it's
treating
state
claims
and
federal
claims
the
same,
and
it's
saying,
when
there's
surprise
we're
going
to
protect
people.
that,
we
suggest,
is
a
legitimate
state
interest.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
but
frequently,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
does.
in
the
example
of
harmless
error,
which
was
discussed
recently
in
this
court's
decision
in
o'neill,
or
forum
non
conveniens,
there's
a
whole
range
of
state
remedial
doctrines
which
may
trump,
if
you
wish
to
put
it
that
way,
may
trump
the
federal
right
and
may
deny
enforcement
of
the
federal
right.
it
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
but
the
harmless
error
doctrine
in
a
state
court,
in
a
state
case,
originates
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
and
the
question
is,
is
it
consistent
with
this
court's
rules.
the
same
thing
is
suggested--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--justice
souter,
i
take
the
example
of
res
judicata,
for
example.
this
court
say
in
bendix
that
this
tolling
statute
is
unconstitutional.
the
state
says,
we
have
a
rule
of
res
judicata.
we're
not
going
to
open
closed
cases.
well,
those
closed
cases
remain
closed,
the
people--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--justice
souter,
i
don't
agree
with
that.
i
think
that
this
issue
could
have
been
raised,
at
least
in
theory,
by
reynoldsville
casket,
for
example,
bringing
a
declaratory
judgment
after
the
accident
to
have
this
provision
of
the
ohio
statutes
declared
unconstitutional,
and
they--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i'm
merely
suggesting
that
there
is
a
remedy
here,
that
it's
not
a
situation
in
which
there
is
no
remedy
available.
the
traditional
remedy,
of
course,
is
to
raise
it
as
a
defense.
but
for
what
it's
worth,
that
still
doesn't
put
them
on
par
with
the
individual
who
has
litigated,
for
example,
a
direct
appeal
on
habeas,
or
has
already
had
an
opportunity
for
litigation
in
the
normal,
we
assume
the
normal
adversarial
context
under
the
res
judicata
rules.
you're
saying,
well,
in
order
to
avoid
unconstitutionality,
they
should
have
taken
the
affirmative
step
of
beginning
their
own
litigation.
well,
i'm--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i'm
not
saying
they
should
have.
i'm
saying
that
that
is
an
option
that
was
available
to
them.
there
is
a
potential
remedy.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
think
that
ohio
is
entitled
to
make
the
choice,
as
it
does
routinely
and
across
the
board.
it
is
not
discriminating
against
the
federal
right.
it
is
simply
deciding
a
remedial
issue.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that
is
the
effect
of
it,
but
not
as
a
choice-of-law
matter,
as
a
remedial
matter
of
saying
that
where
people
are
surprised--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
do
think
the
label
reflects
real
substance
underlying
the
ohio
rule
of
decision.
there
is
a
huge
difference,
both
as
a
practical
matter
and
in
theory
between
saying
as
a
choice-of-law
matter
we
refuse
to
apply
bendix
retroactively
and
saying,
we
apply
bendix
retroactively,
we
recognize
that
we
are
bound
by--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--yes,
and
justice
ginsburg,
in
the
syllabus
they
rely
on
article
i,
section
16
of
the
constitution.
they
are...
which
is
a
right
to
a
remedy
provision.
they
are
relying
on
a
right
to
a
remedy
provision,
mistakenly
saying
that
that
trumps
this
court's
rules
about
retroactivity,
but
i
think
it
is
nonetheless
clear
what
they
are
saying,
even
though
they
should
have
said
it
differently:
that
there
is
a
right
to
a
remedy
here
when
you
are
surprised.
as
this
court
has
frequently
held
in
past
cases
involving
state
law,
all
sorts
of
law,
where
you
are
surprised
you
get
the
benefit
of
tolling
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
and
we
don't
think
that
that's
an
exceptional
thing,
and
it
has
been
done
at
least
twice
by
this
court
in
st.
francis
and
chevron,
and
in
glaus,
for
example--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--the
opinion
may
be
used
to
interpret--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--clarify
and
interpret
the
syllabus,
and
we
agree
that
to
the
extent
that
they
said
that
the
ohio
constitution
trumps
some
federal
principle,
they
were
wrong.
what
they
should
have
said
was,
and
this
is
what
we
urged
on
them...
we
did
not
urge
to
the
contrary.
what
we
urged
on
them
was
that
the
ohio
constitution,
the
right
to
a
remedy
provision,
was
consistent
with
federal
law,
and
that
they
could,
at
one
and
the
same
time,
recognize
that
they
were
bound
by
the
bendix
decision,
but
take
account
of
the
surprise
factor
by
applying
this
right
to
a
remedy,
this
provision
of
the
ohio
constitution.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
would
have
a
serious
question
about
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
first
of
all,
if
a
decision
of
this
court
says
that
a
federal
right
does
not
exist,
ohio
could
not
continue
to
apply--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--and
you
would
have
to
inquire,
under
those
circumstances,
whether
the
reasons
that
ohio
gave
for
preserving
the
state
substantive
provision
were
legitimate
or
illegitimate,
and
probably
in
most
cases
they
wouldn't
be
legitimate.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i
don't
think
we're
arguing,
justice
scalia,
that
the
state
in
all
circumstances
can
preserve
expectations.
what
we
are
saying
is,
we
ask
you
to
look
specifically
at
this
case.
it
involves
the
statute
of
limitations.
it
is
traditional
both
in
ohio
and
in
the
federal
system
to
toll
statutes
of
limitations
where
there
is
surprise,
and
we
are
saying
that
in
those
limited
circumstances
it
is
legitimate
for
the
ohio
supreme
court
to
say,
if
there
is
surprise,
we
are
going
to
toll
the
statute
of
limitations.
we
do
it
in
other
situations.
we
are
going
to
do
it
in
this
situation.
that
is
a
legitimate
state
interest.
it
is
an
established
state
interest.
it
is
a
nondiscriminatory
state
interest.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
think
the
question
is
whether
the
ohio
supreme
court's
decision
represents
an
independent
constitutional
violation,
and
it
is
not,
we
suggest,
a
violation
of
the
commerce
clause,
it
is
a
nondiscriminatory
rule.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
does
not
urge
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
has
violated
the
commerce
clause.
they
are
urging--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--but
the
rule
of
bendix
rested
on
the
notion
of
discrimination
on
the--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--but
what
it
held
was
applying
commerce
clause
principles.
whether
you
characterize
those
as
nondiscrimination
principles,
certainly
the
interest
in
the
protection
of
interstate
commerce
was
one
side
of
the
balance,
and
what
we're
suggesting
here
is
that
ohio
is
not
doing
what
it
did
in
the
foreign
corporation
provision.
it
is
not
saying
that
we
are
going
to
create
a
situation
where
foreign
corporations
do
not
get
the
benefits
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
that
is
not
the
holding
at
all.
what
they
are
saying
that
anybody
who
is
surprised
will--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--but
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
not
have
understood
that
a
foreign
corporation
can
claim
immunity
from
all
state
rules
of
law
simply
because
it
is
an
out-of-state
corporation
if
it
faces
a
nondiscriminatory
rule,
and
we
suggest
that
the
rule
of
surprise
here
is
a
nondiscriminatory
rule.
it
cannot
claim
a
commerce
clause
violation
any
more
than
any
corporation--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
what
it
is
doing
is
it's
applying
an
entirely
different
rule
of
state
law
resting
on
other
considerations
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
whether
they
are
a
foreign
corporation
or
a
domestic
corporation,
that
anyone
can
take
advantage
of
the
ohio
tolling
rule
which--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--no--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--justice
scalia,
it
is
not
shaped--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--justice
scalia,
it
is
not
shaped
by
the
tolling
rule
that
was
held
invalid
in
bendix.
if
you
look
at
the
decisions
that
the
ohio
supreme
court
cited
in
this
case,
the
hardy
decision,
the
eli
lilly
decision,
gong
back
to
1882,
and--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
what
it
allows
you
to
do
is
to
sue
for
a
reasonable
time
after
the
earlier
statute
was
invalidated.
we--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--justice
kennedy,
i
do
not
think
it
is
distinguishable
on
the
facts
from
chevron,
and
i
do
think
that
applying
the
chevron
rule
here
suggests
that
we
should
prevail,
but
in
our
view
the
chevron
rule
is
too
restrictive.
this
ought
to
be
judged
by
other
principles
such
as
those
articulated
in
howard
v.
rose,
and
the
state
limitation
should
be
sustained
unless
it
is
discriminatory,
not
established,
not
reasonable.
we
think
this
one
is
reasonable.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
thank
you.
