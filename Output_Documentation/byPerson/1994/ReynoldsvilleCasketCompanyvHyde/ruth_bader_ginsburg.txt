justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
that
connection,
it's
my
understanding
that
the
only
thing
that
counts
in
ohio
is
the
syllabus,
that
everything
else
is
like
a
law
review
article,
is
that
not
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
we
should
look
at
just
this
one
sentence.
the
syllabus
said,
the
supreme
court
decision
may
not
be
retroactively
applied
to
bar
claims
which
accrued
prior
to
the
announcement
of
that
decision.
that's
the
holding
of
the
court,
and
that's
al
that
counts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
chevron
oil,
where
there's
still
some
vitality
left
to
it.
in
that
case,
shouldn't
we
uphold
the
ohio
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
it
have
something
to
do
with
the
statute
of
limitations
and
the
tolling
that
would
be
possible
under
the
old
law
in
ohio
and
not
in
pennsylvania?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
what
the
statute
of
limitations
would
have
been
in
pennsylvania?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
where
under
any
theory
the
defendant
always
was,
because
the
defendant
is
from
pennsylvania.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
timing
sequence?
i've
forgotten.
when
was
the
bendix
decision?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
it
would
have
already
too
late.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
the
only
notice
was
the
district
court...
the
only
hint
was
the
district
court
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
sixth
circuit
you
said
came--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--when
it
would
have
already
been
too
late
under
the
2-year
limit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
the
district
court
decision--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
3
days
after
the
accident.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
by
the
sixth
circuit
had
decided,
more
than
2
years
had
elapsed
since
the
accident.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
following,
because
june
of
1988
was
much
too
late.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
foreshadowing
would
have
to
have
been
while
plaintiff
still
could
have
acted
on
time,
so
the
only
thing
that
could
have
been...
could
count,
the
only
decision,
is
the
district
court
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dyk,
on
the
question
of
reliance
interest,
this
case
seems
to
me
different
from
the
chevron
oil.
was
there
any
reason
why
this
plaintiff
could
not
have
sued
either
in
pennsylvania
or
in
ohio
within
the
2-year
limitation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
as
far
as
suing
in
ohio,
the
long
arm
had
been
long
on
the
books.
there
was
no
impediment
to
suit
in
ohio.
the
tolling
for
an
out-of-state
defendant
had
long
ago
become
anachronistic,
hadn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
was
the
reason,
mr.
dyk,
for
the
tolling
provision
originally?
why
were
statutes
of
limitations
tolled
against
out-of-staters?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
the
tolling
provisions
come
in
in
a
day
when
there
were
no
long
arms?
isn't
that
the
derivation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
could
not
take
into
account
the
enormous
difference
between
a
world
without
long
arms,
where
you
had
to
put
your
hands
on
the
defendant
in
the
state,
and
the
time
when
it
was
just
a
matter
of
sending
notice
by
mail?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
dyk,
why
isn't
a
basic
federal
principle
of
equal
treatment
applicable
here?
you're
talking
about
unfairness
to
the
plaintiff
whose
lawyer
might
not
have
realized
that
tolling
provisions
were
becoming
obsolete,
but
what
about
reynoldsville
casket
point
that
bendix
got
off?
i
am
entitled
to
be
treated
the
same
way
bendix
is
treated.
what
about
the
disparity
in
the
treatment
of
identically
situated
defendants?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
discriminating
or
not,
it
is
in
effect
ruling
that
the
ohio
constitution
can
make
the
bendix
decision
prospective
only
in
ohio.
that's
the
effect
of
it,
is
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whatever
label
you
put
on
it,
the
result
is
a
prospective
application
of
a
decision
that
this
court
declared
to
be
fully
retroactive.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that,
mr.
dyk,
is
what
ohio
said.
i
asked
a
question
of
mr.
warren,
is
it
isn't
what...
under
ohio's
own
law
what
counts
is
the
syllabus,
and
under
the
syllabus,
section
16
of
article
i
of
the
ohio
constitution...
under
that
provision,
recent
u.s.
supreme
court
decisions
may
not
be
retroactively
applied
to
bar
claims
in
state
courts
which
accrued
prior
to
the
announcement
of
the
decision.
that
is
the
holding
of
the
ohio
supreme
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
however,
you
recast
the
decision,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
i
thought
it
was
the
statute
of
law
of
ohio
that
the
holding
of
the
case,
the
case
law
comes
out
of
the
syllabus
and
not
the
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
clarify.
