g.

in
this
case,
qualitex
is
a
company
that
makes
press
pads
for
dry
cleaning
services
and
they
color
them
special
green
gold
and
people
began
to
associate
the
green
gold
with
the
qualitex
company
and
they
trademarked
that
color.
somebody
else
began
to
imitate
the
pads,
the
defendant,
and
then
qualitex
sued
them
for
trademarking
infringement.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
a
color,
pure
and
simple
cannot
be
a
trademark
and
that
was
the
issue
that
we
had
to
decide.
we
decided
that
a
color,
pure
and
simple
can
sometimes
be
a
trademark.
our
reason
basically
as
we
look
at
the
statute,
it
spells
that
trademark
can
include
any
word,
name,
symbol
or
device
and
that
seems
to
me
almost
anything.
also,
it’s
true
that
in
the
past,
shapes
and
sounds
like
the
nbc
chimes
and
even
a
smell
has
sometimes
been
a
trademark.
it
fits
within
the
rest
of
the
definition
that
is,
it
can
pick
out
and
distinguish
a
product
and
put
in
people’s
mind
the
fact
that
product
is
associated
with
the
particular
company
and
so
it
can
serve
the
purpose
of
trademark
law
and
also
at
some
point,
sometimes
a
color
wouldn’t
necessarily
serve
our
function
because
if
it
serves
a
function
other
than
just
identifying
the
company,
it
can’t
be
a
trademark.
so,
it
seems
to
qualify.
now,
the
ninth
circuit
thought
there
was
special
reason
to
involving
colors,
would
prevention
from
being
trademarks
such
as
that’ll
be
hard
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other,
but
lots
of
things
are
hard
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other.
they
thought
there
are
limited
supply
of
colors,
but
actually
there
are
many
and
the
doctrine
of
functionality
makes
certain
that
colors
can
still
be
used
to
make
things
beautiful
or
serve
other
functions
and
trademark,
well,
won’t
tie
them
up
and
we
look
into
the
history
of
the
statute
and
thought
in
historical
terms
to,
it’s
meant
to
apply
to
colors
and
for
that
reason
we
reverse
the
ninth
circuit
and
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
