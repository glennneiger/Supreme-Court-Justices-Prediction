stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
didn't
agree
with
you
on
the
formalistic
thing...
suppose
i
think
it
isn't
supposed
to
be
formal.
the
figures
i
read
here
in
the
sg's
brief
are
that
somewhere
over
60
percent
or
so
of
all
the
buyers
of
this
thing...
of
all
the
buyers,
the
relevant
buyers
of
insurance
are
erisa
plans.
not
25
percent,
but
60
percent.
and
also,
suppose
that
i...
i
mean,
in
other
words,
if
i
don't
think
it
should
be
formal,
i
think
it
should
be
practical,
on
this
point,
then,
do
i
have
to
be
against
you,
or
is
there...
i
mean,
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
it
looks
like
25...
they're
increasing
the
thing
enormously,
that
their
purpose
in
increasing
the
charge
is
to
make
the
erisa
plans,
who
constitute
60
percent
of
the
buying
public,
along
with
the
other
40
percent,
switch
to
the
blues,
that
that's
the
purpose
of
this
big
increase,
or
restructure
the
commer...
what
they
buy,
and
therefore,
if
i
don't
think
formally
but
think
practically,
i'd
have
to
be
against
you
on
this.
i'm
asking
you,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
it's
not
just
that.
it's
that
they
have...
they're
a
large
percentage
of
the
marketplace,
and
the
very
object
of
this
plan
is
in
a
significant
way
to
effect
a
decision
of
a
matter
that's
at
the
heart
of
their
very
existence,
what
kind
of
insurance
they
buy,
or
what...
who
they
buy
it
from.
that
is,
there's
nothing
more
important
than
that
to
them,
and
the
purpose
of
the
new
york
law
is
significantly
to
affect
that
choice.
that's
the
argument
that
this
has
a
big
practical
impact.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
mr.
murphy,
would
you
go...
you
were
giving
a
series
of
examples--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--when
justice
ginsburg
added
one
to
the
series,
but
what
is
the...
kind
of
what
is
your
general
statement
that
distinguishes
those
examples
from
what
we've
got?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
your
next
case
up
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
your
next
case
up
here?
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
argue
it
now.
do
you
concede
that
that
may
be
done
under
the
savings
clause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
why
doesn't
this,
too,
because
if
your
basic
argument,
which
i
think
personally
is
a
very
strong
one,
is
that
the
whole
purpose
of
this
thing,
you
just
said,
was
to
affect
in
a
very
significant
way
the
erisa's
plans'
and
others'
choices
of
which
insurance
company
to
buy
from,
or
at
least
to
force
the
commercial
companies
to
adopt
the
characteristics
like
open
enrollment,
et
cetera,
then
why
doesn't
that
very
argument,
insofar
as
it's
accepted,
require
us
also
to
think
that
what's
happening
is
the
regulation
of
insurance?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
and
this
is
a
regulation
of
insurance
because
it
makes
certain
kinds
of
policies
much
more
expensive,
and
therefore
it
affects
the
consumer
choices
as
to
whether
this
insurance
company
or
that
insurance
company.
if
that
isn't
regulation
of
insurance,
what
is?
wasn't
price
regulation
what
insurance
regulation
was
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--my
question
is,
basically
you're
arguing
that
the
reason
it
affects
erisa
plans
is
because
it
will
make
certain
policies
a
lot
more
expensive,
and
therefore
they'll
switch.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly,
so
why
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
is
that?
i
mean,
you
have
quite
a
good
answer,
actually,
but
i
thought
that
if
you're
reading
the
words
erisa.
look
at
that
practical
thing.
why
wouldn't
you
read
the
word
"regulate"
exactly
the
same,
that
as
a
practical
matter,
this
has
the
effect
of
raising
insurance
rates?
that's
its
very
object...
its
very
object,
and
therefore,
for
the
same
practical
reason
as
to
the
one,
you'd
read
the
other.
now,
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that
only
means
that
not
everything
that
regulates
also
relates
to,
but
some
things
that
relate
to
may
regulate,
and
the
question
is,
when
they
have
that
practical
effect,
why
don't
we
regard
them
as
regulation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
your
argument
was
that
you
were
affecting
the
insurance
company,
and
for
that
reason
you
were
affecting
the
choice
of
the
erisa
plan.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
enough,
i
would
suppose.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
you
wouldn't
have
to
be
concerned
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
see
that
formally,
but
at
the
heart
of
southeastern
underwriters
and
the
mccarran
act
is
the
question
of
the
price
charged
the
customer,
and
so
here,
you
have
a
regulation
designed
directly
to
affect
that,
though
at
one
remove.
why
should
the
one
remove
make
a
difference?
