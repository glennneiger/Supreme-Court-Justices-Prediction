mr.
craig
p.
murphy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
congress
enacted
erisa,
it
made
a
determination
that
erisa
plans,
the
type
of
benefits
they
offer
and
the
systems
that
an
employer
uses
to
deliver
those
benefits,
should
be
left
to
the
decision
of
the
employer.
congress
therefore,
when
it
enacted
erisa's
preemption
clause,
used
a
very
broad
formulation,
the
formulation
being,
does
a
state
law
relate
to
any
erisa
plan?
i
think
justice
souter's
exorbitant-exorbitant
formulation
would
be
a
question
that
might
have
some
interest
and
meaning
in
this
case
in
the
context
of
a
regulating
formulation,
but
congress
made
the
decision
here
not
to
preempt
only
those
laws
which
regulate
erisa
plans,
which
in
my
view
any
kind
of
an
exorbitant-exorbitant
surcharge
would,
but
made
the
determination
to
preempt
any
law
which
relates
to
an
erisa
plan.
the
state's
entire
argument
in
this
case
comes
down
to
the
point
that
to
fall
within
erisa's
relating-to
clause,
a
law
has
to
restrict
or
dictate
plan
choice.
in
morales...
and
i
speak
to
morales
with
some
trepidation,
realizing
the
court
today
issued
another
airline
deregulation
case
which
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
read,
but
in
morales,
this
court
made
it
abundantly
clear
that
under
a
relating-to
formulation
the
test
is
not
whether
a
law
relates...
excuse
me,
whether
it
dictates
or
restricts,
it's
whether
the
law
has
a
connection
with
the
thing
that...
the
subject
matter.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
i'm
sorry,
regulating--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--your
honor,
in
the
end,
what
this
court
has
to--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--of
course
not.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
and
let
me
explain
why.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
okay.
in
each
case,
what
this
court
has
to
do
is
examine
the
nexus
between
the
law
at
issue
and
erisa
plans.
if
you're
talking
about
the
regulation
of
what
a
hospital
pays
for
wage
rates,
what
it
does
with
its
medical
waste,
what
it
does
in
terms
of
the
licensing
of
its
physicians,
what
kinds
of
taxes
the
physicians
pay
on
their
income,
you
are
dealing
with
things--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--well,
if
you're
talking--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--if
you're
talking
about
the
taxes
on
the
benefits
which
an
erisa
plan
pays,
then
i
believe
you
do
have
a
relation
to--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--erisa...
section
514(a)
preempts
laws
only
insofar
as
they
relate
to
erisa
plans.
that
law,
the
tax,
to
the
extent
it
was
imposed
on
revenue
paid
by
erisa
plans,
would
relate
to
plans,
in
my
view.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
yes.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
my
general
statement
is,
with
regard
to
those
things
what
the
state
is
doing
is,
they
are
regulating
an
upstream
supplier
of
erisa
plans
in
a
way
which
simply
has
an
indirect
impact
on
the
plan.
in
this
case,
what
they
are
doing
is
fundamentally
different.
what
the
state
of
new
york
is
doing
here
is,
it
is
imposing
an
assessment
on
the
amount
a
plan
pays
in
hospital
benefits,
and
it's
making
the
amount
of
that
assessment
turn
on
the
very
plan...
the
very
form
the
plan
adopts
to
deliver
its
benefits.
under
subdivision
1,
section
3
of
erisa,
an
erisa
plan
is
defined
to
be
an
arrangement,
through
the
purchase
of
insurance
or
otherwise,
by
which
an
employer
provides
his
employees
with
hospital
care,
among
other
benefits.
the
two
essential
characteristics
of
an
erisa
plan
are
its
delivery
of
hospital
care
through
an
arrangement,
insurance
or
otherwise,
and
in
this
case,
these
statutes
impose
a
surcharge
on
the
very
benefit,
hospital
care,
which
makes
a
plan
a
plan,
and
makes
the
amount
of
that
assessment
turn
on
the
fundamental
decision
of
the
plan
as
to
how
best
to
deliver
its
benefits.
what
we're
dealing
with
here
is
simply
a
state
which
has
decided
to
try
to
drive
the
conduct
of
erisa
plans
by
using
a
system
of
economic
sanctions
rather
than
direct
regulation.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
your
honor,
that
was
their
purpose,
although
i
disagree
with
the
statement
that
they
were
trying
to
control
costs
when
they
imposed
what
are
in
effect
taxes
on
hospital
services,
but
the
way
they
tried
to
provide
hospital
care
to
the
needy
here
was
by
making
erisa
plans
operating
in
new
york
use
new
york's
financially
distressed
blue
cross-blue
shield
system.
they
can't
do
that
directly
by
mandating
it,
nor,
under
a
relating-to
formulation,
can
they
do
the
same
thing
by
imposing
a
series
of
economic
sanctions.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
well,
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
laws.
in
fact,
if
your
honor
reads
the
appendix
here
and
looks
at
the
affidavits
from
the
state
officials
and
the
blue
cross
people
who
were
responsible
for
these
laws,
there's
no
doubt
that
was
the
purpose.
they
clearly
acknowledged
that
was
the
purpose,
that
the
purpose
of
these
laws
was
to
drive
erisa
plans...
what
was
happening,
your
honor,
is,
in
the
late
1980's,
blue
cross
was
experiencing
a
financial
crisis.
we
can
argue
and
debate
what
the
cause
of
that
crisis
was,
whether
it
was
mismanagement,
as
justice
souter
noted,
or
some
other
things.
the
fact
is,
erisa
plans--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
way
new
york
chose
to
make
it
more
viable
was
to
give
erisa
plans
an
incentive
to
switch
their
coverage
from
either
self-insurance
or
commercial
insurance
to
blue
cross.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
your
honor,
effective
april
1st,
1993,
new
york
did
precisely
that,
which
is,
they
required
that
every
insurer
operating
in
new
york
state
engage
in
community
rating
and
open
enrollment
in
the
small
group
market,
which
was
the
only
market
in
which
blue
cross
and
blue
shield
ever
did
this
and,
in
fact,
even
though
they
did
that,
they
continue
to
impose
the
surcharges
on--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--what's
that?
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
well,
we
will
see.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
i
have
to
see
how
i
do
today
before--
[laughter]
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
well,
no...
which
is...
what
may
be
done
under
the
savings
clause,
open
enrollment
and
community
rating?
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
yes.
i
don't
think
there's
any
issue
under
the
savings
clause
that
new
york
state
says
to
an
insurer,
you
have
got
to
provide
coverage
to
the
people
who
meet
the
following
characteristics.
that
satisfies
all
of
the
elements
of
this
court's
tests
under
the
savings
clause.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
well,
because
when
you
deal
with
open
enrollment
and
community
rating,
or
the
law
in
new
york,
what
the
state
has
said
to
insurance
companies
is,
this
is
what
you
have
to
do.
in
this
case...
and,
you
know,
i'll
just
call
your
attention
to
the
metropolitan
life
case,
where
this
court
pointed
out
that
mandated
mental
health
benefits
was
a
regulation
of
insurance,
1)
because
it
established
the
terms
of
the
insurance
contract
and
2)
because
it
imposed
requirements
only
on
insurance
companies--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--first
of
all,
your
honor,
this...
these
laws
do
not
make
any
insurance
policy
more
expensive.
what
these
laws
do
is,
they
impose
a
surcharge
on
hospital
rates
on
the
basis
of
the
form
of
the
erisa
plan.
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
in
cases
under
the
savings
clause
and
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
that
in
order
to
regulate
insurance...
and
let
me
emphasize
that
word.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
i
understand
what
your
point--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--and
it
affects
insurance
companies
for
the
same
reason.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
but
the
savings
clause
doesn't
preserve
laws
which
relate
to
insurance
companies,
it
only
preserves
laws
which
regulate
insurance
companies--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--and
this...
these
laws
are
not
regulating
insurance
companies.
they
don't
impose
a
single
requirement
on
any
insurance
company
in
the
state
of
new
york
to
do
anything.
what
these
laws
do...
and
if
there's
any
doubt
on
that,
let
me
just
call
your
attention
to
page
10,
footnote
10,
of
the
state's
reply
brief,
where
the
state
concedes
that
the
surcharge
laws
don't
obligate
any
insurer
to
pay
anything
to
any
hospital.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
this
law
relates
to
erisa
plans,
which
is
a
much
broader
formulation,
as
this
court
noted
in
morales.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
i
believe
it
would,
but
again,
your
honor,
what
this
court
has
made
clear
in
its
cases
under
both
the
erisa
savings
clause
and
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
that
the
purpose
of
the
exception
we're
dealing
with
here
was
not
to
make
the
states
supreme
in
all
matters
relating
to
insurance
companies.
the
purpose
was
to
give
the
states
regulatory
authority
on...
over
the
actual
contract
of
insurance.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
you
have
to
look
at
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words
congress
has
used
here.
the
term
"relate
to"
means
to
refer
or
have
a
connection
with.
the
term
"regulate"...
the
term
"regulate"
means,
as
the
state
states
in
their
reply
brief
when
they
quote
it,
it
means
to
either
restrict
or
dictate
choice.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
well,
because
the
practical
effect
you're
having
here
is,
is
not
on
an
insurance
company.
the
practical
effect
you
are
having
here
is
on
the
erisa
plan.
you
are
moving
the
erisa
plan
to
the
insurance
company.
if--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--well,
i
think
what
you
are--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--i
think
what
you
are
doing,
your
honor,
is
you
are
imposing
a
surcharge
on
the
hospital
benefits
paid
by
the
erisa
plan,
and
let
me
give
you
an
example.
in
the
case
of
a
self-insured
fund,
you're
dealing
with
an
entity
that
is
uninsured,
is
not
in
the
insurance
marketplace,
you
are
imposing
a
surcharge
on
the
benefits
with
the
view
that
that
will
make
the
cost
of
self...
the
self-insured
status
of
the
plan
sufficiently
expensive
that
the
plan
will
make
the
decision
to
move
over
to
new
york's
blue
cross
system
as
one
of
the
amici
did
in
this
case,
the
nysa-ila
plan,
which
an
amici
brief
made
that
determination
as
a
result
of
the
surcharges.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
yes,
i
do
know,
and
they
are
definitely
involved
in
this
suit.
in
fact,
i
can
give
you
the--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--your
honor--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--in
the
complaint
in
this
case,
the
travelers'
suit
as
a
fiduciary
of
an
insured
plan
and
a
self-insured
plan,
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
savings
clause
couldn't
save
the
laws
as
to
self-insured
plans
because
of
the
deemer
clause.
in
the
second
circuit,
the
blues
in
their
brief
argued
that
this
conclusion
was
wrong,
that
the
self-insured
funds,
as
to
self-insured
funds
the
laws
were
also
saved
despite
the
deemer
clause,
and
in
fact
the
blues
in
their
reply
brief
admit
that
the
issue
is
before
this
court.
having
been...
having
signed
the
complaint
in
this
action--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--that
is
correct,
your
honor--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--and
that
was
why--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--your
honor,
it
becomes
a
live
question
only
if
you
disagree
with
me
on
the
relating-to
issue.
then,
only
then,
under
the
solicitor
general's
formulation,
will
the
separate
status--
i
would
like
to
return
to
the
issue
of
the
savings
clause
for
one
moment,
recognizing
that
my
time
is
running
short
here.
in
determining
whether
a
law
falls
within
the
savings
clause,
this
court
has
essentially
done
two
things.
first,
they
have
looked
at
whether
or
not
the
law
dictates
any
of
the
terms
of
the
insurance
policy.
for
instance,
metropolitan
life,
the
law
fell
within
the
insurance
savings
clause
because
it
imposed
the
terms
of
the
insurance
contract.
fmc,
same
thing.
what
it
did
was,
it
knocked
out
any
antisubrogation
provision.
pilot
life,
on
the
other
hand,
the
mississippi
law
of
bad
faith
provided
a
damage
remedy
for
any
insured
whose
claim
was
denied
in
bad
faith.
despite
the
fact
that
that
law
was
intimately
associated
with
the
relationship
of
the
insurer
and
the
insured,
this
court
held
it
was
not
a
regulation
of
insurance
because
it
didn't
actually
set
the
terms
of
the
contract.
the
other
thing...
and
in
response
to
the
question
you
asked
earlier,
justice
breyer,
let
me
explain
why
the
courts
have
focused
on
the
contract
of
insurance.
in
1869,
this
court
decided
a
case...
paul
v.
virginia.
in
that
case,
it
held
that
the
insurance
contract
was
a
transaction
outside
of
interstate
commerce
and
couldn't
be
regulated
by
the
federal
government.
in
1944,
in
the
southeast
underwriters
case,
this
court
overruled
that
decision,
and
held
the
transaction,
the
transaction
being
the
contract
of
insurance,
was
in
commerce.
in
enacting
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
all
congress
wanted
to
do
was
to
give
back
to
the
states
their
regulatory
authority
over
the
contract
of
insurance,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held,
in
national
securities
and
a
number
of
other
cases,
that
the
states
do
not
have
regulatory
authority
with
regard
to
all
matters
affecting
insurance
companies.
in
fact,
in
royal
drug,
this
court
held
that
the
relationship
between
the
insurance
company
and
the
supplier
of
medical
services,
in
that
case
pharmacies,
was
not
within
the
business
of
insurance
that
was
saved,
and
if
you
look
at
this
case,
what
we're
dealing
with
here
are
laws
that
govern
the
relationship--
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
--between
the
hospital
and
the
patient.
they're
even
one
step
removed
from
royal
drug.
mr.
craig
p.
murphy
well,
your
honor,
again,
because
under
erisa's
savings
clause
and
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
what
you're
doing
is,
you're
making
the
states
supreme
with
regard
to
the
regulation
of
insurance,
and
again,
in
royal
drug...
and
let
me
just
emphasize
this.
when
you
say
something
is
the
business
of
insurance,
it
means
not
only
that
the
states...
it
falls
within
erisa's
savings
clause
and
therefore
by
that
act
states
can
regulate
erisa
plans.
it
means
that
the
conduct
at
issue
is
exempt
from
the
antitrust
laws,
and
it
also
means,
under
section
2(b)
of
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
that
any
time
there
is
a
conflict
between
federal
and
state
law,
state
law
prevails.
in
other
words,
the
normal
rules
of
preemption
are
reversed.
for
all
of
those
reasons,
the
savings
clause
has
been
construed
narrowly,
and
again,
i
will
just
note,
your
honor,
in
royal
drug,
the
practice
at
issue
was
completely
about
regulating
the
costs
of
an
insurance
company,
what
it
paid
under
its
pharmacy
agreements,
so
that
it
could
make
insurance
more
available
at
a
lower
price,
and
this
court
held
that
the
agreements
were
not
the
business
of
insurance
because
they
did
not
dictate
the
terms
of
the
insurance
contract.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
