justice
david
h.
souter
but
don't
you
have
an
easier
case
in
a
shaw
situation
than
you
do
in
the
hypothetical
that
justice
kennedy
gave
you?
i
mean,
in
the
shaw
situation...
i
don't
mean
you
have
an
easier
case,
but
in
the
shaw
situation
the
effect
of
the
regulation
is
to
determine
the
subject
matter
of
coverage.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
this
case,
what
you're
concerned
with
is
simply
what
is
paid
for
a
given
coverage,
whether...
if,
indeed,
that
coverage
is
written.
isn't
this
an
easier
case
than
shaw?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we
have
a
record
that
allows
us
to
judge
whether
in
fact
the
act
is
carrying
out
an
equalization
purpose
rather
than
a
shifting
purpose?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
do
we
know...
what
do
we
know
about
the
resulting
rates?
i
mean,
is...
presumably
you're
going
to
say,
well,
blue
cross
is
higher
anyway,
so
that
the
surcharge
does
not
have
the
effect
of
driving
people
away
as
it
would
if
the
rates
were
equal,
to
start
with.
do
we
have
that
in
the
record?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
saying
that
justice
scalia's
exorbitant-exorbitant
example,
then,
would
never
change
your
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
if
we've
got
to
draw
a
line,
i
want
to
know
how
we're
going
to
draw
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
--doesn't
that
criterion
get
us
in
kind
of
an
open-ended
world,
because
under
the
insurance
savings
clause
it
can
do
a
lot
of
things
directly,
and
if
i
understood
what
you
were
just
saying,
you're
saying,
if
they
could
do
it
directly,
which
would
include
under
the
insurance
savings
clause,
they
can
do
it
by
this
kind
of
regulation.
do
you
stand
by--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
not
by
virtue
of
the
clause.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
suppose
regulating
wage
rates
has
a
remote
connection.
what
would
your
position
be
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
it's
preemption.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
how
do
you...
tell
us
how
you
want
us
to
draw
the
line.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
have
to
say
that
this
law
does
not
regulate...
when
we're
on
the
preemption
prong,
you
have
to
say
that
this
law
does
not
regulate
the
conduct
of
erisa
plans.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
to
some
extent
could
it
directly
mandate
that
hmo's
take
on
a
different
class
of
patients?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
equivalent
of
open
enrollment--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
effect
of
your
argument
is
that
the
hmo's,
by
virtue
of
the
relating-to-erisa-plan
language,
really
escape
virtually
all
the
regulation
on
the
subjects
that
we're
talking
about,
whereas
the
insurance
companies
would
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
second
circuit.
as
part
of
a
hospital
rate
setting
scheme,
new
york
requires
hospitals
to
collect
surcharges
from
patients
covered
by
a
commercial
insurer
but
not
from
patients
insured
by
blue
cross
blue
shield
plan.
it
also
subjects
certain
health
maintenance
organizations
the
surcharges
depending
on
the
number
of
medicaid
recipients
the
hmo
has
enrolled.
commercial
insurers
and
hmo
sued
state
officials,
claming
that
the
federal
employee
retirement
income
security
act
of
1974
or
erisa
preempts
the
surcharges.
erisa
regulates
employee
benefit
health
plan
some
of
which
provide
commercial
health
insurance
or
hmo
membership
as
a
means
of
resting
the
regulation
of
such
plans
away
from
the
states.
the
act
provides
the
preemption
of
state
laws
that
relates
to
any
covered
employee
benefit
plan.
the
district
court
found
that
the
new
york
surcharges
just
were
preempted
because
they
could
lead
to
an
increase
in
erisa
plan’s
cost
and
that
the
purpose
of
the
surcharge
was
to
increase
the
relative
attractiveness
of
ensuring
a
blue
cross
blue
shield
and
to
make
membership
in
hmo
that
enroll
only
few
medicaid
recipients
relatively
expensive.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
holding
this
purposeful
interference
for
the
choices
that
erisa
plan
make
for
healthcare
coverage
triggered
the
preemption.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
court
today,
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
second
circuit
and
hold
that
new
york
surcharges
do
not
relate
to
erisa
plans.
to
give
content
for
the
limitation
on
preemption,
we
look
to
erisa’s
objective
and
find
that
the
principle
purpose
of
preemption
was
to
avoid
multiplicity
of
regulations
not
to
issue
a
national
cost
uniformly
and
that
this
purpose
does
not
require
a
preemption
of
the
surcharges.
moreover,
they
hold
that
erisa
preempts
new
york
surcharges
would
be
inconsistent
with
congress’
silence
regarding
substantial
state
efforts
underway
in
1974
to
regulate
healthcare
cost
and
it
would
render
a
legal
nullity,
congress’
approval
just
months
after
erisa,
a
federal
assistance
to
those
state
efforts.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
