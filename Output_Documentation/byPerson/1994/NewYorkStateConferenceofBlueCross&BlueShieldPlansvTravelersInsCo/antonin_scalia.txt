ms.
smith,
one
way
new
york
could
have
achieved
the
purpose
it
has
in
mind
here
is
simply
to
require
everyone
to
purchase
health
insurance,
if
at
all,
from
the
blues
and
from
no
other...
from
no
commercial
insurance
company.
that
would
achieve
the
same
result.
now,
suppose
new
york
did
that.
the
only
health
insurance
that
anyone
can
purchase
is
from
blue
cross
and
blue
shield.
would
that
relate
to
erisa
plans?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
well,
you
know
what
the
next
question
is
going
to
be.
new
york
doesn't
say
you
have
to
go
with
blue
cross
and
blue
shield,
but
you
pay,
you
know,
an
exorbitant
surcharge
if
you
go
with
anybody
else--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
is
effectively
a
prohibition.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
that
be
bad,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
you're
jumping
ahead
of
me.
i
just
want
an
answer
to
that
question.
suppose
new
york
just
puts
a
heavy
surcharge
on
the
purchase
of
health
insurance
from
anybody
except
blue
cross
and
blue
shield,
would
that
relate
to
erisa?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
see,
so
i
can't
prohibit
going
somewhere
else
absolutely,
but
i
can
make
it
effectively
impossible
by
imposing
an
enormous
penalty.
you
see
a
distinction
between
those
two?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
well,
that's
an
interesting...
interesting
way
to
get
things
done.
don't
prohibit
them,
just
make
them
exorbitantly
expensive.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
that.
that
was
going
to
be
my
next
question.
if
exorbitantly...
but
you
answered
the
wrong
way.
i
mean,
if
exorbitantly
expensive--
[laughter]
if
exorbitantly
expensive
is
bad,
why
isn't
moderately
expensive
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
that
relate,
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
isn't
this
regulation
in
disguise?
isn't
this
essentially
simply
a
means
of
getting
anyone
who
buys
insurance
to
in
effect
subsidize
the
costs
of
the
uninsurable?
if
that
isn't
regulation,
i
don't
know
what
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
many
ways
to
do
it.
you
can
say,
everybody
has
to
buy
from
the
same
insurer,
or
you
can
say,
well,
you
can
buy
from
some
other
insurer,
but
you're
going
to
help
us
subsidize
the
uninsurable
by
paying
a
surcharge
if
you
do
that.
that
sounds
like
regulation
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
just
justifying
the
regulation.
i'm
not
suggesting
it's
not
justified.
it
may
well
be
just
doing
something
that
would
be
done
by
private
ordering
anyway,
but
private
ordering
is
not
covered
by
the
relating-to
clause,
and
public
ordering
by
law
is,
so
you
know,
it
may
well
be
that
it's
doing
something
that
the
private
system
would
otherwise
achieve
anyhow.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
issue
is
whether
this
public
ordering
relates
to
erisa
plans.
justice
antonin
scalia
but--
--but
if
that's
all
that
congress
meant,
which
is
a
very
narrow
thing,
it
could
have
expressed
that
by
the
choice
of
a
much
different
phrase
than
relating
to.
as
we've
said
in
our
opinions,
that
is
an
enormously
broad
phrase.
if
they
wanted
to
say,
you
know,
no
law
that
will
coerce
the
administration
of
a
plan,
they
could
have
said
that.
they
prohibited,
though,
any
laws
that
relate
to
erisa
plans.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
they're
very
inefficient.
maybe
they're
enormously
inefficient,
and
the
reason
people
are
buying
this
other
insurance
is
they
do
a
better
job.
they
charge...
i
mean,
that's
how
any
businesses
compete
in
the
marketplace.
we
can
provide
it
for
less
because
we're
better.
we
do
it
more
efficiently.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
something
in
the
record
that
shows
that
is
the
only
reason
for
the
differential
between
the
blues
and
the
commercial
insurers?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
sure
that's
the
purpose,
but
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
shows
that
it
doesn't
go
beyond
what
is
necessary
to
achieve
that
purpose?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
can
i
question
that?
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
perhaps
the...
certainly
the
most
significant,
and
i
would
imagine
close
to
the
most
expensive
portion
of
any
employee
benefit
plan
is
health
insurance.
i
mean,
it
is
absolutely
central
to
erisa
plans.
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
that
it
happens
to
purchase
it,
it's
that
the
purchasing
of
it
is
central
to
the
whole
function
of
a
benefit
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
metropolitan
life?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
does
this.
it
operates
directly
on
the
choice.
if
you
pay
one
insurer,
you
pay
more.
if
you
pick
the
other,
you
pay
less.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
sure
about
that?
is
it
the
case
that
every
type
of
coverage
that
is
offered
by
commercial
insurers
is
also
offered
by
the
blues?
justice
antonin
scalia
may
it
not
be
that
if
you
want
to
get
blue
cross
coverage
it
has
to
be
a
certain
type
of
coverage?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
that
the
same
result
does
not
necessarily
ensue
from
new
york's
decision
to
do
what
it
attempted
to
do
here
in
the
different
manner
of
requiring
all
insurers
to
carry
these
high
risk
subscribers.
if
they
did
that,
the
plan
would
still
be
able
to
choose
among
various
insurers
who,
although
subject
to
the
same
regulation
in
that
respect,
might
be
more
efficient.
i
mean,
there...
it
may
well
be
that
some
of
the
high
cost
of
the
blues
is
due
not
merely
to
their
carrying
these
special
clients
but
to
their
inefficiency,
and
if
you
regulated
insurance,
that
would
display
itself
in
variable
rates
by
the
different
companies,
i
assume.
