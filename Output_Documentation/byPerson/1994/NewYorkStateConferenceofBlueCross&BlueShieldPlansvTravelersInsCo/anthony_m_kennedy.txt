justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
you
take
the
facts
in
metropolitan
and
shaw...
pregnancy
benefits
and
mental
health.
suppose
new
york
had
a
very
substantial,
very
heavy
surcharge
on
plans
that
did
not
cover
pregnancy
benefits,
or
did
not
cover
mental
health,
would
that
be
permissible?
would
that
be
a
way
to
get
around
the
shaw-metropolitan
holding?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
a
formalistic
analysis
rather
than
a
pragmatic
economic
analysis
that
governs
us
in
determining
whether
there's
preemption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
state
is
dictating
the
choice,
we
make
a
formalistic
or
juridical
inquiry,
rather
than
a
pragmatic
economic
inquiry.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
seems
to
be
what
you're
saying.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
do
you
agree
with
cocounsel
that
if
the
state
had
put
a
very,
very
heavy
surcharge
on
plans
that
do
not
have
pregnancy
benefits
or
mental
health
benefits,
that
that
would
have
been
not
preempted?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
why
isn't
this
intended
to
operate
the
internal
selection
of
which
plan
to
enroll
in?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
seem
to
me
that
this
would
be
a
greater
infringement
on
the
autonomous
choice
of
the
plan
than
the
pregnancy
benefit
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
kneedler,
are
the
parties...
and
i
take
it
the
court,
when
it
write
the
opinions,
thrust
in
different
directions
when
they
argue
first
that
it
doesn't
relate
to
insurance
and
second,
that
even
if
it
does,
it's
saved
by
mccarran...
by
the
insurance
exemption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
everybody...
don't
they--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
a
law
regulating
wage
rates
which
would
affect
hospital
charges
would
have
that
kind
of
a
connection.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
you
wouldn't
argue
in
that
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
they
have
done
it
in
a
different
way,
simply
by
requiring
all
insurers,
commercial,
including
those
who
insure
erisa,
simply
to
adopt
those
characteristics
of
blue
cross
which
had
broadened
the
coverage
and
hence
made
it
difficult
for
blue
cross,
the
community
rating
and
open
enrollment,
and
so
on?
