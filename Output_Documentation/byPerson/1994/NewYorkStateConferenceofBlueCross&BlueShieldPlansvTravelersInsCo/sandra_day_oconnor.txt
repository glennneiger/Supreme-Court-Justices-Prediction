ms.
smith,
new
york's
scheme
applies
to
hospitalizations
that
are
covered
by
erisa
plans
as
well
as
those
that
aren't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
a
law
of
general
applicability.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
percentage
of
the
patients
in
new
york
are
covered
by
erisa
plans,
would
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
if
the
effect
of
new
york's
law
were
to
sweep
in
only
people
covered
by
erisa
plans?
would
your
argument
change
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
some
erisa
plans
are
self-insured,
i
believe.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
this
law
can
be
applied
to
erisa
plans
that
are
self-insured?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
a
very
direct
effect,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
does
even
more
than
that.
in
the
9-percent
hmo
case,
for
instance,
it
would
have
the
effect
of
trying
to
require
them
to
cover
medicaid
patients.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
can't
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
your
position
boils
down
to
saying,
any
law
of
general
applicability
which
has
only
an
indirect
economic
effect
on
erisa
plans
is
okay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it's
as
simple
as
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
regardless
of
whether,
in
fact,
the
state
is
trying
to
get
plans
to
offer
certain
types
of
coverage
rather
than
others.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
could
be
behind
the
state
scheme,
but
it's
okay
as
long
as
it
is
carried
out
only
indirectly
by
an
economic
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
what
about
a
self-insured
plan?
there,
the
effect
is
hardly
indirect--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
should
we
do
there,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
self-insured
plans
are
different
here,
as
the
solicitor
general
appears
to
concede.
are
they
actually
involved
in
this
suit,
do
you
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
record
is
clear--
