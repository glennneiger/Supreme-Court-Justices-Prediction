mr.
harold
n.
iselin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
unlike
the
13-and
11-percent
surcharges,
the
9-percent
assessment
that
is
imposed
exclusively
on
hmo's
and
on
the
employee
benefit
plans
they
serve
has
nothing
to
do
with
new
york
state's
hospital
reimbursement
system
or
the
rates
that
are
paid
to
hospitals.
thus,
even
if
petitioners'
concerns
about
the
effect
this
case
might
have
on
the
state's
hospital
reimbursement
system
were
relevant
to
the
issue
of
erisa
preemption,
such
concerns
are
clearly
irrelevant
to
the
issue
of
whether
the
9-percent
assessment
is
preempted.
what
is
more,
the
state
has
conceded
that
the
savings
clause
does
not
apply
to
the
9-percent
assessment.
thus,
the
only
question
the
court
must
address
is
whether
the
9-percent
assessment
relates
to
employee
benefit
plans.
where
the
9-percent
assessment
is
similar
to
the
13-and
11-percent
surcharges
is
that
all
three
interfere
with
one
of
the
most
basic
decisions
an
erisa
plan
makes,
namely,
how
best
to
provide
health
care
coverage
to
employee
benefit
plans.
the
9-percent
assessment
interferes
with
this
decision
by
imposing
on
hmo's,
and
only
on
hmo's,
a
penalty
calculated
at
9
percent
of
the
cost
of
non-medicaid
in-patient
care.
basically,
what
the
statute
requires
is
for
the
hmo
to
calculate
all
of
its
costs
on
in-patient
hospital
care,
then
medicare
and
medicaid
get
subtracted
out,
and
what
is
left
is
multiplied
by
9
percent
and
paid
directly
to
the
state
outside
the
hospital
reimbursement
system.
mr.
harold
n.
iselin
that
is
different
from
both
other
surcharges,
both
of
which
go
to
the
hospitals.
one
is
kept
by
the
hospital,
the
13.
the
11
is
cycled
through
the
hospital
back
to
the
state.
the
exclusion
of
medicaid
is
particularly
significant
because
that's
the
piece
the
state
pays,
so
the
state
said,
well,
we'll
take
ourselves
out,
and
basically
once
you
do
that
calculation,
all
that's
left
are
essentially
erisa
plans.
there
may
be
a
few
individual
subscribers,
but
well
in
excess
of
95
percent
are
employer
benefit
plans.
in
other
words,
the
9-percent
assessment
targets
one
form
of
health
care
coverage
and
increases
its
cost
relative
to
other
systems
of
coverage
for
reasons
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
actual
costs
of
the
care
provider.
in
the
case
of
the
9-percent
assessment,
this
interference
is
particularly
egregious
because
of
the
unique
relationship
that
employee
benefit
plans
have
with
hmo's.
when
an
employee
benefit
plan
contracts
with
an
hmo
for
health
care
coverage,
it
is
purchasing
a
system
of
care.
that
differs
substantially
from
indemnity
insurance.
an
hmo
by
definition
is
charged
with
maintaining
the
health
of
its
members,
not
simply
indemnifying
them
for
treatment
that's
provided
after
the
member
becomes
ill
and
needs
services.
thus,
every
hmo
has
a
network
of
primary
care
physicians
who
have
the
responsibility
for
monitoring
and
maintaining
the
health
of
the
members,
where
they
have
the
emphasis
on
preventive
care.
that
primary
care
network
is
integrated
with
specialists
and
hospitals,
and
the
whole
web
of
doctors,
hospitals,
and
members
are
all
subject
to
a
range
of
rules
that
are
intended
to
ensure
that
care
is
coordinated
and
delivered
in
the
most
efficient
manner.
mr.
harold
n.
iselin
well,
your
honor,
the
purpose,
the
stated
purpose
of
the
statutes
may
be
somewhat
different,
but
the
effect
is
identical,
because
both
sets
of
cases
have
the
state
imposing
surcharges
that
are
interfering
with
the
decisions
erisa
plans
want
to
make
as
to
how
best
to
provide
health
care,
and
one
of
the
things,
again,
that
the
statute
itself
talks
about,
is
delivering
hospital,
medical,
or
surgical
benefits
through
the
purchase
of
insurance
or
otherwise.
now,
surely
the
hmo's,
to
other
types
of
coverage
that
are
different
from
insurance.
that
is
a
choice
that
is
specifically
identified
in
the
statute,
so
that
even
if
the
state's
purpose
with
the
9
percent
may
be
somewhat
different,
the
effect
on
erisa
plans
remains
the
same.
mr.
harold
n.
iselin
they
can't
regulate
them
in
a
way
that
would...
that
would
relate
to,
and
that
would...
relate
to
erisa
plans
and
interfere
with
the
choice
erisa
plans
make.
mr.
harold
n.
iselin
that
they
can't
require
them,
again,
in
a
manner
that
would
interfere
with
the
choices
or
the
quality
of
care
that's
provided
by
the
hmo,
which
could
also
happen
if
the
state
required
hmo's
to
enroll
medicaid
recipients
in
a
manner
that
overburdened
the
delivery
system
of
the
hmo,
which
can--
mr.
harold
n.
iselin
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
could,
for
the
reason--
mr.
harold
n.
iselin
--well,
i
think
they
could
require
open
enrollment,
but
open
enrollment
is
very
different
from
what
the
state
has
done
here
with
targets,
and
i
think
any
system
that
relies
on
targets
and
compels
hmo's
to
take
medicaid
recipients
in
that
manner
is
problematic,
because
again,
hmo's
have
a
limited
capacity
to
deliver
care.
some
may--
mr.
harold
n.
iselin
--no,
your
honor,
because
what
we
have
here
for
hmo's
is
the
federal
hmo
act,
and
the
federal
hmo
act
on
many
of
these
issues
acts
as
a
sort
of
hmo
savings
clause
because
it
specifically
authorized
states
to
conduct
regulation
of
hmo's
in
many
aspects
similar
to
what
we
talked
about
earlier,
community
rating
being
one
very
good
example.
now,
that
act
was
passed
just
1
year
before
erisa,
and
i
think
when
you
read
the
two
together,
the
federal
hmo
act
preserves
for
the
states
actually
a
fairly
high
level
of
regulation
of
hmo's,
but
it
does
not
preserve
differing
assessments
on
what
hmo's
pay,
thereby
interfering
with
employee
benefit
plans.
there
are
four
specific
ways
that
the
9-percent
also
very
directly
interferes
with
the
choice,
and
since
my
time
is
running
short,
i'd
like
to
talk
about
one
in
particular,
and
one
result,
when
you
increase
costs
in
this
way
and
it
gets
passed
through
from
the
hmo
to
employee
benefit
plans,
is
not
just
that
the
plans
pay
more,
but
they
also
can
restructure
benefits,
increase
copayments
and,
particularly
important,
sometimes
plans
drop
coverage
altogether.
this
is
particularly
common
with
small
businesses,
who
might
be
right
at
the
margin
of
whether
they
even
provide
coverage.
an
hmo
tends
to
be
the
lowest
cost
option
in
the
market.
thus,
when
we
think
about
the
impact,
it's
not
enough
just
to
think
about
it
as
increasing
costs,
which
it
certainly
does
here,
but
also
reducing
benefits,
which
is
very
analogous
to
met
life,
and
in
fact
causing
some
employee
benefit
plans
to
just
say,
we
have
no
more
money
to
pay
this
added
cost.
we
can't
increase
our
coinsurance
or
our
copayments
because
they're
at
the
maximum,
we
can't
strip
away
any
more
benefits
because
we're
at
the
minimum
level
of
benefits
that
we
can
provide
through
the
hmo.
the
only
choice
we
have
left
now
is
to
discontinue
coverage.
and
one
of
the
ironic
things
of
the
state's
position
is
that
at
the
same
time
that
it's
trying
to
increase
coverage,
and
is
arguing
for
that
as
a
justification
for
these
assessments,
the
actions
may
have
the
exact
opposite
effect,
which
is
to
price
some
employee
benefit
plans,
and
particularly
those
of
small
business,
right
out
of
the
market.
finally,
i'd
like
to
touch
briefly
on
the
metropolitan
life
case,
because
as
some
have
noted,
it's
directly
analogous
here,
particularly
on
the
compelling
versus
inducing
point,
and
again,
one
of
the
options
in
metropolitan
life,
faced
with
having
to
pay
for
the
mental
health
benefit
at
issue,
was
that
plans
had
two
choices.
they
could
either
move
to
self-insurance,
which
was
directly
recognized
in
that
decision,
or
they
could
take
this
other
option
which
i
just
described,
which
is
to
simply
drop
coverage.
the
law
in
metropolitan
life,
which
the
court
recognized
related
to
employee
benefit
plans,
was
no
more
compulsory
than
the
assessments
at
issue
here.
plans
still
retained
options,
and
they
could
have
chosen
to
exercise
those
options,
just
as
erisa
plans
here
may
have
some
theoretical
options.
