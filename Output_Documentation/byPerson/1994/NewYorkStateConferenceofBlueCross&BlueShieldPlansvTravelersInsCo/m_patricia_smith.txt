ms.
m.
patricia
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
an
effort
to
contain
rising
health
care
costs
and
assure
wide
availability
of
affordable
health
insurance,
new
york
has
long
regulated
hospitals
and
other
providers
in
the
health
care
marketplace.
new
york
has
traditionally
regulated
differing
segments
of
the
marketplace
differently.
while
these
laws
may
affect
the
prices
which
erisa
plans
and
others
pay
for
health
care
services,
they
do
not
relate
to
plans.
any
other
result
would
severely
limit
the
state's
effort
to
regulate
in
the
health
care
marketplace,
since
much
state
regulation
affects
costs
and
therefore
may
affect
choice.
in
superseding
state
laws
that
relate
to
employee
benefit
plans,
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
intended
to
displace
traditional
state
authority
over
the
regulation
of
health
care,
creating
a
regulatory
vacuum.
however,
if
these
types
of
laws
do
relate
to
plans,
two
of
the
assessments
in
this
case
which
are
imposed
upon
hospital
bills
regulate
insurance
within
the
meaning
of
erisa's
insurance
savings
clause,
because
they
are
designed
to
moderate
insurance
rates
of
certain
insurers
in
order
to
support
the
underwriting
and
rate-setting
practices
of
open
enrollment
and
community
rating
which
new
york
has
determined
allows
health
insurance
to
be
more
widely
available
at
a
lower
cost.
traditionally,
new
york
has
treated
different
segments
of
the
health
care
marketplace
differently.
blue
cross,
even
before
the
state
regulated
hospital
rates,
was
used
by
the
state
as
the
insurer
of
last
resort.
they
traditionally
practiced
community
rating
and
open
enrollment.
they
enrolled
people
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
their
age,
their
sex,
or
their
health,
and
they
community
rated.
they
had
one
rating
pool
for
a
large
number
of
people,
thereby
people
with
high
risks
whose
insurance
would
be
very
expensive
would
be
able
to
obtain
insurance
at
lower
costs.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
yes,
your
honor,
they--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--yes.
they
apply--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--your
honor,
there's
nothing
in
the
record.
the
hospital
association's
brief
has
quoted
a
citation
of
25
percent
of
the
total
hospital
bills
covered--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--your
honor,
if
somehow
new
york's
law
had
a
disproportionate
impact
on
erisa
plans,
in
other
words
somehow
erisa
plans
were
singled
out
or
treated
differently
from
other
purchasers
of
hospital
services,
then
that
would
be
a
different
case.
that
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case.
but
in
this
case,
all
of
the
categories
of
the
patients
in
all
of
the
payor
rates
cover
both
erisa
plans
and
non-erisa
plans.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
your
honor,
the
effect
on
erisa
plans
that
are
self-insured
is
that
it
may
raise
their
hospital
bills
over
what
they
would
have
been
if
the
law
was
exactly
the
same
but
the
payor
differentials
were
taken
out.
i
think
it's
appropriate--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--no,
your
honor.
hmo's
are
not
self-insured
plans,
they're--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--they
can't
be.
they're
totally
different
entities,
so
when...
a
regulation
of
a
health
maintenance
organization
has
nothing
to
do
with
self-insured
plans.
new
york
is
not
in
any
way
attempting
to
force
self-insured
groups,
whether
they
be
erisa
plans
or
not,
to
enroll
medicaid
recipients.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
your
honor,
if
the
marketplace
was
such
that
there
were...
that
would
be...
if
the
marketplace
was
such
that
there
were
many
other
insurers
out
there,
and
that
new
york
made
a
rule
that
said
all
small
groups
must
go
to
blue
cross,
that
would
relate
to
erisa
plans.
that,
however,
your
honor,
is
not
the
effect
of
this
particular
law.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
your
honor--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--you--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--you
pay
a
surcharge
if
you
do
go
with
blue
cross
and
blue
shield.
you
pay
the
surcharge
of
the
added
cost
of
open
enrollment
and
community
rating.
what
new
york
is
trying
to
do
is
to--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--no,
that
would
not
relate
to
erisa
plans.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
that
would
not
relate
to
erisa
plans.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
one
is
a
regula...
is
a
requirement,
and
one
is
an
incentive
in
the
marketplace.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
but
keep
in
mind,
your
honor,
that
the
facts
of
this
case
are
not,
in
an
effect,
a
requirement.
it
is
not--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--your
honor--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--exorbitantly
expensive...
i
believe
i
answered
exorbitantly
expensive
was
not
prohibited.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
the...
but
it
is...
at
some
point--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--yes.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
there
is
a
point
where
you're
no
longer
dealing
with
economic
incentives
but
that
it
is
regulation
in
disguise,
or
it
is
a
regulatory
requirement.
i
don't
think
that
point
is
simply
based
on
the
numbers,
whether
it's
10
or
20
or
1,000,
but
there
may
become
a
point
where,
looking
objectively
at
this
statute,
it
becomes
clear
that
there
is
no
other
choice
for
anyone
in
the
marketplace.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
numbers.
it
is
not
a
question
of
how
exorbitant
it
is,
it's
a
question
of
looking
at
the
statute
and
seeing
if
there's
some...
if
there
is
some
point
where
it
simply
is
a
sham.
it
is
regulation
in
disguise.
but
it's
not
a
question
of,
is
it
1,000
percent,
or
10
percent,
or
20
percent.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
your
honor--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--your
honor,
historically
the
insured
have
always
subsidized
the
uninsured,
whether
or
not
it's
in
the
bad...
whether
or
not
it's
the
fact
that
the
uninsured,
when
they're
cared
for
in
the
hospital,
end
up
on
the
bad
debt
and
charity
rolls,
and
everyone's
hospital
costs
are
increased
to
support
the
hospital
overhead.
in
unregulated
markets,
the
insured
subsidize
the
uninsured.
because
the
federal
government
in
the
medicaid
program
pays
the
hospitals
generally
at
less
than
cost,
then
the
insured
subsidized
the
elderly.
the
phenomenon
of
cost-shifting
in
the
hospital
market
is
an
old
one,
and
it
exists
in
all
kinds
of
regulated
or
unregulated
markets.
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
new
york
statute
was
to
minimize
the
cost-shifting.
the
cost-shifting
that
occurred
prior
to
the
statute,
the
differential
between
blue
cross
and
the
commercial
insurers,
was
25
to
40
percent,
and
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
this
was
to
equalize
that.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
your
honor,
the--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--the
result
of
that
would
be
the
displacement
of
all
hospital
rate
regulation,
because
all
hospital
rate
regulation
has
in
their
components
some,
whether
it's
cost-shifting
for
the
uninsured,
or
cost-shifting
for
other
patients.
in
new
york's
regulatory
system,
which
is
not
challenged
here,
for
instance,
besides
a
bad
debt
and
charity
component,
which
one
could
consider
be
cost-shifting,
there's
a
component
that
for
excess
malpractice,
which
could
be
considered
to
be
cost-shifting
to
protect
doctors
who
have
committed
malpractice,
there's
a
component
for
rural
initiatives,
which
would
be
considered
cost-shifting
from...
to
hospitals
where
there
are...
to
rural
hospitals.
so
if
the
result
is
that
new
york
may
not
cost-shift
in
any
manner,
then
it's
going
to
be
very
difficult
for
new
york
to
regulate
in
the
hospital
area.
it
will
be
difficult
for
any
state
to
regulate
in
this
area
if--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--yes,
that
would...
if
there
was
a
surcharge,
instead
of
restricting
the
plans'
choice
of
not
having
a
policy
without
mental
health,
or
not
having
a
policy
without
pregnancy,
if
the
state
put
a
surcharge...
let
the
plans
have
their
choice.
they
could
structure
their
plans
any
way
they
wanted,
but
if
you
didn't
want
to
cover
mental
health
coverage
there
would
be
a
surcharge
in
order
for...
to
support
the
state
psychiatric
hospitals.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
what
governs
you
is
the
purpose
of
erisa
preemption,
which
is
to
provide
that
plans
may
be
able
to
choose
on
a
multi-state
basis
their
structure
and
administration.
so
long
as
the
state
is
not
dictating
or
restricting
the
choices,
they
may
place
economic
incentives
when
they
regulate
in
the
marketplace
so
long
as--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--yes.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
unless...
unless
the
pragmatic
economic
inquiry
is
such
that
the
state,
although
it
appears
that
its
incentive
is
in
the
marketplace,
is
actually
foreclosing
everyone's
choice.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
they
did
say
that,
your
honor,
in
the
legislative
history.
it
is
quite
clear
in
the
legislative
history,
in
describing
the
meaning
of
"relate
to"--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--that
they...
they
were
concerned
with
laws
that
impose
requirements
on
plans'
structure
and
administration,
but
they--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--yes.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
so
long
as
that--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--so--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--in--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--so
long
as
it's
regulating
in
the
marketplace,
and
it's
treating
everyone
in
the
marketplace
the
same,
and
it's
not
singling
out
plans
for
different
treatment
than
any
other
consumer
of
health
care.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
yes.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
yes,
that
is,
your
honor.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
because
60
percent--
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
whether
or
not
erisa
plans
are
25
percent
or
60
percent
or
88
percent
of
the
marketplace
shouldn't
make
a
difference
in
this
case.
erisa
plans
are
there
not
by
operation
of
law
but
because
this
is
a
benefit
area,
and
under
that
sort
of
theory
that
the
larger
percentage
they
are
of
the
marketplace
the
less
the
state
is
able
to
regulate
erisa
plans,
sort
of
as,
by
the
dint
of
their
collective
purchasing
power
occupy
the
marketplace
and
therefore
displace
the
state
from
regulation,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
intent
that
congress
when
it
passed
erisa,
and
erisa
plans
were
a
larger
percentage
of
the
economic
health
care
marketplace
then,
was
intending
to
displace
the
states
from
health
care
authority
because
they
constituted
a
large
percentage
of
the
marketplace.
they
do...
are
a
large
percentage
of
the
health
care
marketplace.
in
10
years
they
may
be
a
large
percentage
of
the
day
care
marketplace.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
two
points,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
point
of
new
york
law
is
not
to...
and
its
objective
purpose,
the
way
it
works,
is
not
to
drive
everyone
to
blue
cross,
it
is
to
level
the
playing
field.
it
is
to
make
blue
cross
as
competitive
as
anyone
else,
not
more
competitive
than
anyone
else.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
yes,
you
do,
your
honor.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
what
we
know
in
the
record
is
that
commercial
insurers,
even
after
the
surcharges,
offer
lower
rates.
the
other
thing
that
we
can
see
in
the
record
is
that
in
years
where
the
commercial
insurance
rates
were
going
up,
again
with
the
surcharges,
7.5
percent,
blue
cross
rates
were
going
up
28
percent.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
the
record
also
shows
that
the
commercials
do
it
more
efficiently
and
better
because
when
you
exclude
the
high
risks
you
save
30
percent
on
your
premiums,
so
that
the
reason
that
the
blues'
rates
are
higher
are
because
they
do
insure
the
higher
risks.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
the
commercial
insurers
have
indicated
that
the
reason
for
the
differential
is
to
pay
blue
cross
for
the
added
costs
of
open
enrollment
and
community
rating.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
i
would
think
that
the...
the
record
shows
that
it
didn't
achieve
the
purpose,
and
that's
why
the
state
felt
it
necessary
to
impose
for
the
1-year
period
the
11
percent.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
m.
patricia
smith
yes.
