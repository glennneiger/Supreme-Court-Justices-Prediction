justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
i
thought
you
made
a
distinction
that
at
some
point
an
inducement
could
become
a
requirement.
i
thought
that
was
the
position
you
took
in
your
brief.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
did
say
that
if
enrollment
in
blue
cross
were
required,
that
would
relate
to
erisa
plans.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
isn't
there,
in
reality,
a
point
where
the
toll
is
so
heavy
that
it
becomes,
in
effect,
a
requirement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
it
were
sufficiently
exorbitant,
then
you
would
give
justice
scalia
a
different
answer
to
his--
--exorbitantly
exorbitant...
yes.
[laughter]
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
your
essential
point
that
new
york
is
attempting
to
regulate
health
care,
erisa
plans
happen
to
be
a
large
part
of
that
market,
but
that
new
york
would
be
doing
essentially
the
same
thing
in
that...
were
there
no
erisa
plans,
and
that
if
you
read
related-to
as
any
time
that
it's
going
to
have
an
impact
on
erisa
plans
you
essentially
take
new
york
out
of
the
business
of
regulating
health
care
costs.
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
nub
of
your
argument?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
impact
is
primarily
felt
by
erisa
plans.
at
least,
that
seemed
to
be
the
theory
of
one
of
the
judges
who
has
written
in
these
cases.
is
that
enough?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
could
read
the
words,
relate
to,
to
mean,
have
an
impact
on,
couldn't
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
you
say,
in
answer
to
the
question
that
justice
scalia
asked
ms.
smith,
that...
i
thought
you
said
in
your
brief
that
there
could
come
a
point
where
the
toll
was
so
exorbitant
that
you
couldn't
tell
the
difference
between
a
requirement
and
an
inducement,
and
in
that
case
you
might
say
it's
preempted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
about
the
taxes
imposed
on
the
hospitals--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
talking
about
a
tax
on
the
gross
receipts
of
hospitals
which
will
include
in
part
payments
they
receive
because
of
erisa
plans.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
according
to
new
york,
they're
trying
to
regulate
the
availability
of
medical
care
to
patients,
even
high
risk
patients,
even
medicaid
patients,
and
the...
and
to
control
costs.
are
we
to
say...
to
second-guess
that
that
was
new
york's
purpose?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
that
in
fact
result?
did
they
make
erisa
plans
switch
to
blue
cross
en
masse?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
purpose
was
to
make
blue
cross
a
more
viable
choice,
not
to
make
it
the...
in
effect,
to
require
blue
cross
in
lieu
of
commercial
insurers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
murphy,
if
the
second
circuit
thought
that
there
was
preemption,
total
preemption,
then
they
never
focused
on
perhaps
the
self-funded
plans
are
different,
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
if...
it
would
be
an
academic
question,
if
we
agreed
with
your
position.
it
becomes
a
live
question
which
was
never
treated
below
only
if
we
disagree
with
your
position
with
respect
to
the
private...
with
respect
to
the
nonself-funded
plans.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
iselin,
maybe
i
misperceive
it,
but
isn't
there
a
big
difference
between
the
first...
what
we
heard
from
the
commercial
insurers,
the
attempt
to
influence
the
erisa
plans'
choice...
here,
the
effort
is
not
to
affect
the
erisa
plan's
choice,
but
to
get
the
hmo's
to
do
something,
to
get
the
hmo's
to
service
a
larger
number
of
medicaid
patients,
and
if
the
hmo's
respond
that
way,
that's
it.
it's
not
attempting
to
get
the
erisa
plans
to
choose
blue
cross
over
travelers,
for
example.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which...
so
you're
saying,
because
there's
an
impact
on
erisa
plans,
new
york
simply
cannot
regulate
the
hmo's
to
require
them
to
take
on
more
medicaid
patients?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can't
require
them
to
take
on
more
medicaid
patients,
or
impel
them
to
or
induce
them
to,
as
long
as
they
have...
as
they're
used
by
erisa
plans.
that's
essentially
your
argument.
