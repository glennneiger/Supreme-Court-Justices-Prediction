mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
has
stated
on
several
occasions
that
erisa
preemption
analysis
must
be
guided
by
the
respect
for
the
separate
spheres
of
governmental
authority
under
our
federalist
system.
erisa...
the
erisa
preemption
clause
is
designed
to
identify
the
separate
sphere
that
is
carved
out
in
this
context
for
federal
law
and
not
state
law.
in
shaw,
this
court
addressed
extensively
the
background
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
preemption
clause,
which
shows
that
it
was
intended
to
preempt
the
field
of
benefit...
employee
benefit
plan
regulation
and
to
prevent
employee
benefit
plans
from
conflicting
and
inconsistent
regulation.
as
a
matter
of
both
common
sense
and
tradition,
the
field
or
sphere
of
benefit
plans
is
distinct
from
the
field
or
sphere
of
health
care
or
related
health
insurance.
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
in
the
sense
that
an...
so
in
the
sense
that
an
employee
benefit
purchase...
purchases
health
insurance,
there
is
a
transaction
between
them,
but
that
does
not
make
the
state
law
relate
to
the
erisa
plan--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
a
relevant
sense.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is,
but
it's...
as
we
understand
the
way
the
erisa
preemption
clause
operates,
it
is
primarily
designed
to
preserve
for
federal
regulation
the
things
that
speak
to
erisa
plans
themselves,
their
internal
operations,
their
internal
selection
from
among
the
choices
that
are
made
available
to
them
under
state
law
or
the
market,
but
it's
not
intended
to
reach
outside
that
sphere
and
regulate
the
choices
that
are
made
available
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
metropolitan
life,
that
statute
operated
directly
on
the
choice
being
made
by
the
insurance
plan,
or
the
erisa
plan,
when
it
purchased
insurance.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
in
our
view,
the
effect
here
is
both
indirect
and
economic,
and
for
that
reason
it
is
not
preempted,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
that
would
raise
a
more
difficult
question,
for
this
reason,
in
that
the
surcharge
would
be
designed
to
affect
the
internal
operation
of
insurance
or
coverage
that
plans
and
others
offer.
in
this
case--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
without
regard
to
choices
of
coverage,
without
regard
to
whether
certain
benefits
will
be
covered
at
all.
what
it
does
is
simply
regulate--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
going
back
to
a
question
that
was
asked
earlier,
whether
a
state
law
that
required
all...
that
basically
reserved
the
health
care
market
for
blue
cross,
it
is
not
evident
that
that
would
relate
to
plans.
it
would
be
saved
by
the
insurance
savings
clause.
but
what
it
does
is,
it
constricts,
perhaps,
the
choices
available
to
the
erisa
plan
when
it
is
going
out
into
the
market,
but
it
does
not
reach
into
the
erisa
plan
and
dictate
the
choice
or
create
impermissible
incentives
for
the
erisa
plan
to
choose
among
the
options
that
are
made
available
in
this
instance
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
may
well
be,
but
again,
that
impact
is
without...
is
irrespective
of
the
existence
of
erisa
plans,
which
is
an
important
test
for
whether
a
law
is
one
of
general
applicability.
what
this
state
regulation
may
well
do,
historically
blue
cross,
as
distinct
from
hmo,
as
distinct
from
commercial
insurance,
in
those
segments
of
the
market,
blue
cross
has
a
lot
of
erisa
plans,
but
the
availability
of
those
various
options
is
important
to
erisa
plans,
but
it
also
is
a
variety
of
choices
for
other--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
our
view,
self-insured
plans
do
present
distinct
questions
for
exactly
that
reason.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
our
view
the
court
should
remand...
if
the
court
concludes
the
statute
does
not
relate
as
a
general
matter,
the
court
should
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals,
because
it's
not
clear
whether
the
self-insured
plans
are
included
in
the
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
we
think
respondents
are...
meet
themselves
coming
and
going
on
that
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
we
think...
if
the
objection
is
that
the
state
laws
somehow
have
an
impact
on...
among
plan
choices,
in
other
words
impact
on
insurance
coverage,
then
that...
then
to
that
extent
it
is
a
law
regulating
insurance
within
the
meaning
of
the
insurance
savings
clause,
in
our
view.
but
in
our
view,
you
don't
have
to
get
to
that
point,
because
it
doesn't
relate
to...
because
that
is...
even
though
there
may
be
a
differential
effect
on
different
sorts
of
insurance
coverage,
it
is
still
indirect
and
economic.
and
i
would
like
to,
if
i
could,
tie
that
point
to
this
court's
test
for
determining
whether
something
relates
to
an
erisa
plan,
and
that
what
this
court
has
said
is
something
relates
to
if
it
refers
to
or
has
a
connection
with.
the
court
of
appeals
here
said
there
was
no
reference
to,
so
the
question
is
whether
there's
a
connection
to.
connection
means
joined
with,
or
linked
together.
under
this
scheme
and
its
general
application,
there
is
no
joining
or
linking
of
the
hospitals
whose
rates
the
surcharges
are
attached
to
and
the
erisa
plans.
in
fact,
there
is
a
disconnect,
because
in
the
general
run
of
cases,
except
for
self-insured
plans,
there
is
an
intermediary,
the
insurer,
who
stands
between
the
erisa
plan
that
is
furnishing
coverage
to
its
members
and
the
hospital,
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
impact
on
erisa
plans
is
not
enough,
particularly
since
the
statute
is
one
of
general
operation
that
operates
with...
irrespective
of
erisa
plans.
each
of
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--perhaps,
but
we
think
that
in
shaw,
where
the
court
looked
to
the
dictionary
definition,
there
is...
the
dictionary
definition
in
total
suggests
a
joining
together,
an
association
between
the
two.
and
again,
we
think
an
indirect
market
impact,
which
is
what
the
state
regulation
causes,
really
breaks
the
connection,
and
particularly
when
one
goes
back
to
the
purpose,
which
this
court
has
emphasized,
of
the
erisa
preemption
clause,
which
is
to
preser...
which
is
not
to
impose
conflicting
regulations
directly
on
the
plan
itself,
so
a
plan
perhaps
operating
interstate
would
be
subject
to
different
plan
structures,
or
different
choices
internally
imposed
on
it
by
state
law.
there's
no...
nothing
having
the
force
of
law
that
bumps
up
against
an
erisa
plan
in
this
case.
the
impact
is
solely
economic
in
terms
of
what
the
insurer
intermediary
may
choose
to
pass
on.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that
would
turn
on
whether
the...
whether,
if
the
state
prohibited
it
outright,
it
would
be
preempted,
and
it's
not
clear
that
a
law
that
required...
that
preserved
the
insurance
market
for
blue
cross,
for
example,
would
relate
to
erisa
plans.
it's
a
very
erisa-centered
view
to
say
that
that
will--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
i
think
if
the
exor...
first
of
all,
that's
not
this
case,
because
there
isn't--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but...
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
the
exorbitant-exorbitant
would
matter,
of
course,
if
what
the
state
was
trying
to
drive
the
erisa
plan
to
do
was
something
that
it
couldn't
do
directly,
and
in
that
case,
yes,
a
state
plan
is
designed
to
reach
into
an
erisa
plan
and
effect
what
benefits
it
offers
to
its
employees
would
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--would
be
preempted.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
meant
directly,
not
by
virtue--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--of
the
insurance
savings
clause,
although
we
do
say...
take
the
position
in
our
brief
that
this
law
is
saved
by
the
insurance
savings
clause.
