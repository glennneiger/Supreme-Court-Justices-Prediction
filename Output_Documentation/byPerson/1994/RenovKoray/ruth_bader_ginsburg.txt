justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr....
in
that
case,
mr.
estrada,
was
it...
it
was
in
a
jail.
was
it
daily,
or
was
it
just
a
weekend--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
was
out
during
the
day.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
one
other
question
i
had
about
the
background
of
this.
between
the
time
that
the
sentence
was
received
and
the
time
he
was
sent
to
the
allen...
was
it
allenwood
penitentiary?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
he
get...
he
remained
in
the
halfway
house
at
that
time.
did
he
get
credit
for
those?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
4
weeks,
too,
didn't
count?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
it
was
postsentence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
claim
here
being
made
for
those
4
weeks
as
well
as--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
matter,
mr.
estrada,
whether
the
prisoner
has
any
notice
of
the
difference?
as
i
recall
these
facts,
this
man
was
detained
in
jail
for
the
first
2
months,
so
he
got
credit
for
that.
then
he
asked
to
be
released
on
bail,
and
he
got
this
confining
bail.
did
he
know
that
there
was
this
change
when
he
got
those
rather
restrictive
bail
conditions
and...
yes,
well,
tell
me
if
he
knew
first,
and
then
i
would
like
to
ask
if
he
didn't
know,
wasn't
he
entitled
to
notice?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
estrada,
this
is
my
concern.
you
say
that
the
bureau
had
a
policy,
and
there's
a
statute
that
could
be
interpreted
in
one
way
or
another,
but
the
rules
are
so
careful,
rule
11,
to
say
when
somebody
makes
a
plea,
that
the
judge
with
meticulous
care
had
to
tell
all
the
consequences
of
that.
now
here,
if
a
man
is
in
a
jail
and
then
gets
transferred
to
this
halfway
house
where
he's
allowed
out
only
once
in
150
days,
the
notion
that
he
would
appreciate
that
that
is
not
the
kind
of
detention
for
which
he'll
get
credit,
there's
this
tremendous
change,
maybe
he
would
have
said
if
that's
the
deal,
i
want
to
stay
in
jail.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
mr.
koray
have
said,
when
he
was
acquainted
with
the
terms
of
his
bail,
if
that's
bail,
i
don't
want
it?
could
he
have
said
that
and
withdraw...
he
requested
bail.
he
was
in
jail
and
he
requested
bail.
could
he--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--could
he
have
withdrawn
the
request
once
he
heard
the
terms
of
the
bail?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
there's
no
showing...
you
say
that
he
even
requested
a
change
from
his
jail
confinement
to
his--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
just
suggested
he
wouldn't
have
had
a
choice
anyway--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
he
may
not
have
even
asked
for
bail.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
does
this
play
out
if
it
were
in
a
state...
wholly
in
a
state
system?
justice
breyer
asked
you
about
the
person
who
was
in...
was
being
held
in
a
state
system,
then
he's
transferred
to
federal
authority,
but
suppose
we
were
entirely
within
a
state
system,
new
york
or
new
jersey,
is
it
any
different?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
just
asking
if
you
had
this
kind
of
case
wholly
within
the
state
court--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--where
the
state
court
judge
had
said,
release
on
bail
under
these
conditions,
would
that
or
would
that
not
count
against...
for
credit
against
sentence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
i
just
would...
if
there...
if
it's
just
as
unclear,
just
as
debatable
under
state
law,
i
was
just
wondering
whether
the
state
systems
are
similar
to
the
federal
system.
has
this
question
come
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but,
is
not
one
of
them,
so
you--
