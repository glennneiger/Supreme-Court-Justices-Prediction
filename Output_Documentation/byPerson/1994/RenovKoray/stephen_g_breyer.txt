stephen
g.
breyer
i
can
understand...
the
part
that...
i
understand
your
fallback
argument,
because
i
can
understand
saying
the
states
have
so
many
different
varying
programs
and
these
may
or
may
not
resemble
each
other,
and
it
would
be
a
total
nightmare
to
find
an
absolute
rule.
that's
basically
your
fallback
argument,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
then...
but
i
don't
understand
the
basic
argument
as
well,
because
what
do
you
do?
does
it
turn
on
the
magic
word
"bail"?
i
mean,
how
do
we
know
that
the
states
will
always
use
the
magic
word
"bail"?
perhaps
what
they'll
do
is
they'll
just
say,
we
have
a
person
in
front
of
us,
trial
is
4
weeks
from
today
until
trial,
what
you
will
do
is
you
will
report
nights
and
weekends
to
the
house
on
14th
and
95th
streets,
and
there's
a
house
there,
and
the
person
gets
in
the
house,
and
he
comes
in
at
night,
he
comes
in
on
the
weekend,
he
goes
off
during
work
during
the
day,
work
of
different
kinds...
i
mean,
there
are
a
thousand
variations
on
that
theme.
so
i
understand
the
rule
that
the
circuit
has.
you
look
to
jail-type
conditions.
i
understand
the
possibility
of
saying
it's
all
up
to
the
bureau
of
prisons,
but
i
don't
understand
this
third
possibility.
what
is
the
actual
rule
that
we're
supposed
to
interpret
this
statute
to
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
they
use
the
word
"bail",
then
it
isn't,
even
if
you
put
them
in,
like,
marion,
during--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
if
you
do
use
the
word
"bail"
and
you
don't
use...
how
does
that
work,
that
third
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
problem
is,
suppose
the
state
doesn't
use
the
word
"bail"?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then,
what
is
the
result
in
the
example
i
gave?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
what
it
is,
is
it's
exactly
the
circumstance
of
this
person
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
imagining
a
case.
i'm
imagining
the
state
having
done
to
a
different
prisoner
precisely
what's
true
here.
nights
and
weekends
in
a
house
made
of
concrete,
and
during
the
day
the
person
goes
off
with
a
marshall
close
behind
but
not
always
present.
i
mean,
they
never
use
the
word
"bail".
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
is
the
result?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
if
the
judge
happens
to
say,
i'm
not
giving
you
bail,
i'm
keeping
you
confined.
you're
going
to
go
to
the
house
on
14th
and
95th
streets,
and
that
exactly
happens,
just
what
i
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
want
to
see
if
i
can
get
one
additional.
i'm
going
back
to
the
same
question,
but
it
is
what's
bothering
me.
you
can
make
your
clear
meaning
of
the
statute
work
in
the
federal
system,
i
think,
all
right,
but
to
focus
on
what
i
think
is
bothering
several
people,
i
once
saw
a
film
that
showed
what
the
systems
are
in
alabama
called
intermediate
punishments.
now,
i
don't
know
if
you've
seen
that
or
not,
but
you
can
get
the
idea.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
there
are
a
whole
range
of
things
called
intermediate
punishments,
and
so
it's
easy
for
me
to
think
of
this
wide
range
of
different
degrees
of
confinement,
et
cetera,
and
to
ask
how
your
clear
statement
meaning
works
in
that
context.
one
way
to
make
it
work
is
to
say,
jail
or
not
jail.
that's
what
the
circuit
did.
another
way
to
make
it
work
is
to
say,
did
they
use
the
magic
word
"bail"?
but
they
may
not
have
used
that
word
in
this
state.
i
don't
know
if
they
did
or
not.
a
third
way
is
to
say,
look
to
see
if
they're
in
the
custody
of
the
state
attorney
general.
states
may
not
use
that
kind
of
concept.
so
how
does
your
absolute
system
work
in
the
world
of
intermediate
punishments
which
could
also
be
imposed
as
conditions
of
bail
without
using
the
word
bail?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
do
you...
i
was
actually
not...
i
was
being
slightly
dim,
because
you
think,
too,
they
have
a
clear,
bright
line
test.
but
what
is
their
clear,
bright
line
test?
that's
what
i'm
having
a
hard
time
figuring
that
out,
when
it's
the
state...
i
understand
in
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
the
words
in
the
federal
order
say
custody
by
the
attorney
general.
that's
normal.
but
if
you...
you
practice,
probably,
in
the
state
systems,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
so
is
there,
if
you
try...
you
have
to
apply
this
to
the
states.
how
does
their...
is
there
a
clear
bright
line
you
can
similarly
apply
to
the
states?
