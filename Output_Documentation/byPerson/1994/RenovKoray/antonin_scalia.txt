if
it
was
jail-like
conditions
of
bail.
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rochman,
i'm
concerned
that
our
recording
is
not
going
to
be
able
to
get
what
you're
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
you
don't
stand
near
the
microphone.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
a
walk-around
mike.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
jail-like.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
now,
we
were
speculating
earlier
in
accordance
with
justice
breyer's
questioning
about
what
would
satisfy
the
government's
theory.
what
would
satisfy
your
theory
of
the
case?
suppose
someone
has
to...
he's
remanded
to
the
custody
of
his
parents,
and
has
to
be
home
evenings
and
weekends.
is
that
jail-like?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
jail-like.
his
grandparents.
that's
still
not
jail-like.
an
unrelated
private
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
what
this
has
to
do
with
what's
jail-like.
i
want
to
know
what
is
jail-like.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
does
it
become
jail-like?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
private
party,
so
long
as
you're
remanded
to
the
custody
of
a
private
party,
related
or
unrelated,
it
doesn't
matter,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
this
private...
you
have
to
report
evenings,
you
have
to
stay
there
at
night,
and
if
you
don't,
we'll
send
a
marshall
out
to
bring
you
back.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
help
me.
i
mean,
incarceration
is
just
a
fancy
word
for
jail.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
i
mean,
if
that
makes
it
easier,
let's
say,
when
does
it
become
equivalent
to
incarceration?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
being
at
a
particular
house
every
night
and
weekends
is
not
a
serious
restriction
on
a
person's
liberty?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
not
incarceration.
i
don't--
what
about
being
there
all
the
time?
you
cannot
go
out
of
this
house
at
all,
all
week
long.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
in
a
private
house
it's
not
a
jail,
and
that's
okay,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
know
some
cases
are
easy.
i'm
not
worried
about
the
easy
cases.
i'm
worried
about
where...
you
know,
how
we're
supposed
to
administer
this
line
in
the
future.
there
are
some
problems
that
have
been
brought
out
about
administering
the
government's
line.
i'm
not
sure
that
yours
is
any
easier.
you
can
give
me
an
easier...
easy
case.
you
say
that
your
client's
case
is
an
easy
one
using
this...
you
know,
incarceration-like
test,
but
i
can
think
of
a
lot
of
very
difficult
cases,
and
i
don't
know
what
your
criterion
is,
except
"jail-like
rules",
or
actually
you
should
say
incarceration-like
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
not?
even
if
they
give
you
random
urinalysis
to
see
if
you're
following
their
regime?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
it
work
for
state
custody?
states
don't
have
bureaus
of
prisons?
they
do
not
have
an
officer
who
is
in
charge
of
prisoners
who
have
been
convicted
of
crimes?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
every
state
had
somebody
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
thought--
--no.
i
thought
it
was
broader.
i
thought
it
was
custody
by
the
officer
responsible.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
now,
we're
not
talking
about
fairness
here,
we're
talking
about
the
word,
the
phrase,
"official
detention".
i
mean,
if
you're
talking
about
fairness,
even
if
nobody
thinks
it's
official
detention...
the
government
doesn't,
you
don't,
nonetheless,
if
you
have
to
be
home
5
nights
a
week,
let's
say
custody
of
your
parents
5
nights
a
week
and
all
weekends,
shouldn't
you
be
given
at
least
1/100th
of
that
time
as
credit
against
your
sentence?
it's
not
being
in
jail,
but
it's
a
pain
in
the
neck,
and
if
you
want
to
be
perfectly
fair
you
should
get
some
degree
of
credit
for
it,
shouldn't
you?
well,
it's
not
a
perfect
world.
we're
dealing
with
a
statute
that
took
a
rough
cut
at
eliminating
some
of
the
inequities,
and
the
phrase
it
used
is
"official
detention",
so
let's
work
with
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
rochman,
why
do
you
say
official
detention
means
custody?
what's
your
basis
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
this
was
before
the
bail
reform
act.
isn't
it
conceivable
that
this
new
terminology
was
adopted
in
connection
with
the
bail
reform
act,
and
that
the
best
way
to
decide
what
it
means
is
to
read
it
in
conjunction
with
the
bail
reform
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
i
thought
the
predecessor
statute
didn't
use
the
term
"official
detention"
but
it
used
the
term
"custody".
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
the
predecessor...
i
thought
you
said
that
the
phrase
"official
detention"
did
not
come
full-blown
at
the
time
that
the
bail
reform
act
was
enacted,
but
that
it
had
a
long
history.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
had
a
long
history
is
a
statute
with
the
word
"custody"
in
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
a
statute
with
the
word
"official
detention"
in
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
care
about
that.
that's
just
in
case
we
don't
accept
your
rationale
of
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
even
if
we
accept
the
incarceration
rationale,
you'd
say
this
still
wouldn't
be
incarceration.
