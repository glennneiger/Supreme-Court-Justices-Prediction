we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
74...
correction,
94-790,
janet
reno
v.
ziya
koray.
mr.
estrada.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
very
well,
mr.
estrada.
mr.
rochman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
tell
us
again,
what
was
it
that
mr.
koray
had
signed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
jail-type
rules?
would
the
fact
that
it's
very
constant
confinement
with
just
getting
out
very
rarely,
that
by
itself
does
not
mean
jail-type
rules?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
about
the
drug
treatment
center,
where
it
seems
to
me,
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
you
could
be
subject
to
what
you
have
previously
called
jail--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--wait
till
i
finish
my
question--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--if
you
please.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
could
be
subjected
to
jail...
the
sort
of
jail-like
conditions
you
previously
mentioned,
urine
tests,
monitoring
several
times
a
day,
so
how
do
you
distinguish
that
from
what
you
would
call
incarceration?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--this
is
an
exception,
then,
to
your
more
general
rule
that
if
you
have
jail-like
conditions
it
is
incarceration,
but
it's
not
if
it
comes
under
this
other
section?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
still
another
qualification,
then?
even
though
you
have
all
these
jail-like
terms
of
confinement,
if
it's
not
within
the,
what
you
call
the
traditional
concept
of
incarceration,
it
still
isn't
incarceration?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rochman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
estrada,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
estrada.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
number
94-790,
reno
v.
koray
and
a
provision
of
federal
statute
says
that
a
defendant
generally
must
be
given
credit
toward
the
service
of
a
term
of
imprisonment,
for
anytime
he
has
spent
in
official
detention
before
the
date
the
sentence
commences
and
here
the
respondent
koray
before
his
sentence
commenced,
a
federal
magistrate
judge
had
released
him
on
bail
pursuant
to
the
bail
reform
act
but
ordered
him
confine
to
a
community
treatment
center,
and
when
his
prison
sentence
began
he
asked
the
bureau
of
prisons
to
credit
towards
his
sentence,
the
time
he
spent
at
the
treatment
center
and
the
bureau
refused
this
request
and
so
koray
suit
in
the
district
court
and
lost
there,
and
then
he
took
his
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
ruled
in
his
favor
and
because
there
was
a
split
in
the
court
we
granted
certiorari
and
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
court
today
we
reverse
the
third
circuit
and
hold
that
the
respondent
is
not
entitled
to
a
sentence
credit
because
of
the
time
he
spend
at
the
treatment
center
while
released
on
bail.
this
in
our
view
was
not
official
detention
within
the
meaning
of
the
statutory
section.
if
you
view
the
language
in
isolation,
official
detention
could
either
refer
as
the
government
contends
to
a
court
order
detaining
a
defendant
and
committing
under
the
custody
or
the
bureau
or
as
koray
says
to
restrictive
conditions
of
his
release
on
bail
under
an
official
order
by
the
court
but
the
phrase
official
detention
has
to
be
examined
in
the
light
of
the
bail
reform
act
of
1984.
because
that’s
what
determines
and
authorizes
federal
courts
to
place
restrains
on
the
defendant’s
liberty
and
so
we
reverse
the
third
circuit
and
rule
in
favor
of
the
government
in
this
case.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
