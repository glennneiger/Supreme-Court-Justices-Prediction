justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
ask
you,
before
you
go
back
to
that,
mr.
estrada,
i
want
to
follow
up
on
justice
breyer's
question.
having
the
facts
of
this
case
in
mind,
supposing...
i've
got
two
alternatives.
supposing
the
defendant
asks
for
bail,
and
in
one
case
the
judge
says,
bail
is
granted
on
the
conditions
set
forth
here;
in
the
second
case,
the
judge
says
bail
is
denied,
and
until...
for
the
present
you
will
be
confined
in
exactly
the
same
way,
have
the
rest
of
the
order
be
exactly
the
same,
would
they
require
different
results?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
say
he
does
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--confined
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general,
and
that
custody
shall
be
carried
out
in
the
following
manner.
you
don't
think
he
could
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
if
the
attorney
general
then
followed
up
by
doing
exactly
what
this
judge
ordered?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
he'd
get
credit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
gather,
then,
in
both
cases
there's
detention
that's
only
official
detention
if
the
attorney
general
makes
the
decision.
it's
not
official
detention
if
the
court
makes
the
decision.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
official
if
the
attorney
general
orders
it;
it's
not
if
the
court
orders
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
suppose
there
would
be
credit
even
if
the
attorney
general
decided
to
let
the
person
be
free
on
his
or
her
own
recognizance,
too.
that
would
still
be
official
detention.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
attorney
general
might
be
curious
to
find
out
what
surveillance,
what
a
person
would
do
if
he
was
out
on
his
own.
there
are
situations
in
which
you
might
want
the
person
to
wander
around.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
what...
where
do
you
place
category...
the
cases
in
which
the
defendant
is
granted
bail
but
doesn't
have
the
money
to
put
up
a
bond?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
category
of
cases,
then,
the
attorney
general
would
not
necessarily
be
irresponsible
to
let
a
person
who
cannot
afford
bail
free
on
his
own
recognizance,
would
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
suggested
earlier
that
it
would
be
irresponsible
for
a
judge
to
let
a
person
who
is
remanded
to
the
custody
of
the
attorney
general
free
on
his
or
her
recognizance,
because
there
would
necessarily
have
been
a
finding
of
danger
to
the
community
or
risk
of
flight.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
supposing
a
person
could
not
make
bail
and
there
was
no
such
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it
would
not
be
irresponsible
to
turn
him
loose,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean,
just
so
i
have
your
position
clear,
that
if
in
this
very
facility
the
order
had
provided
that
the
inmate,
if
you
want
to
call
him
that,
could
have
gone
out
during
the
day
and
attended
to
his
work
but
had
to
spend
the
nights
and
weekends
in
the
facility,
that
would
not
be
total
confinement?
